Abstract 
A 2015 Lancet paper by Patel et al. on healthcare access in India 
comprehensively discussed national health programmes where some 
benefits are linked with the country’s Below Poverty Line (BPL) 
registration scheme. BPL registration aims to support poor families by 
providing free/subsidised healthcare. Technical issues in obtaining 
BPL registration by poor families have been previously reported in the 
Indian literature; however there are no data on family assets of BPL 
registrants. Here, we provide evidence of family-level assets among 
BPL registration holders (and non-BPL households) using original 
research data from the Maharashtra Anaemia Study (MAS). 
  
Social and health data from 287 pregnant women and 891 adolescent 
girls (representing 1178 family households) across 34 villages in 
Maharashtra state, India, were analysed. Several assets were shown 
to be similarly distributed between BPL and non-BPL households; a 
large proportion of families who would probably be eligible were not 
registered, whereas BPL-registered families often had significant 
assets that should not make them eligible. This is likely to be the first 
published evidence where asset distribution such as agricultural land, 
housing structures and livestock are compared between BPL and non-
BPL households in a rural population. These findings may help 
planning BPL administration to allocate health benefits equitably, 
which is an integral part of national health programmes.

Introduction
Patel et al. (2015) provided a comprehensive picture of the cur-
rent Indian healthcare structure, and also mentioned the National 
Health Mission’s (NHM) initiative to target inequalities in health-
care access1. Such national health programmes use the ‘Below 
Poverty Line’ (BPL) registration status to identify deprived fami-
lies and provide them with free/subsidised healthcare services2. 
The registration is allocated at family level, based on a scoring 
system calculated using family level assets such as agricultural 
land, housing structures, electricity supplies, household equip-
ment. The scoring system varies within Indian states. The BPL 
status provides access to free healthcare facilities along with 
monthly access to subsidised food products including but not 
limited to wheat, rice, cooking oil and sugar.
There are no data on family assets of BPL registrants. Therefore, 
in this study, we provide evidence of family-level assets among 
BPL registration holders (and non-BPL households) using research 
data we collected previously for the Maharashtra Anaemia Study 
(MAS)3–5. The MAS was conducted though a joint collaboration 
of Halo Medical Foundation (HMF), India and the University of 
Nottingham, UK.
Methods
The MAS was conducted to identify risk factors associated with 
anaemia in pregnant women (3 to 5 months gestation), and in 13 to 
17 year old adolescent girls, living in 34 villages of the Osmanabad 
district of Maharashtra state of India. MAS collected information 
on health and social conditions along with blood investigations to 
examine anaemia risks in rural Indian communities. Additional 
details of the MAS project are published elsewhere3–5.
Data collection also included information on family assets such 
as agricultural land, housing structure, livestock, automobiles, 
employment, and home electronics. In this research note, we 
evaluated family level assets in relation with the BPL registration. 
The comparison was made in BPL and non-BPL holders for 
each asset using Chi-square statistics in Stata Software (V.13.1, 
Texas, USA). 
In total, 287 pregnant women and 1010 adolescent girls partici-
pated in data collection, giving an overall response rate of 95%. 
We selected one person per household at random for the analysis, 
which resulted in 287 pregnant women (Dataset 16), all from unique 
households, and 891 adolescent girls (Dataset 27). Therefore, 1178 
total households across 34 villages (a population of approximately 
65,500) were used in analyses. Written approval was obtained from 
each study participant and their guardian prior to data collection, 
and the same was counter signed by the primary investigator (AA). 
The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee 
of Government Medical College of Aurangabad, India (Refer-
ence number: Pharma/IEC/GMA/196/2014), and also by the Not-
tingham University Medical School Research Ethics Committee 
(Reference number: E10102013).

Results
36.4% of adolescent girls (325/891), and 37.6% (108/287) pregnant 
women in our study had current BPL registration. 32.3% (105/325) 
of adolescent girl families with BPL registration had more than 5 
acres of farming land, and 54.4% (177/325) had a colour televi-
sion. Overall, of the 6 assets we assessed, 3 showed no significant 
differences in distribution (p>0.05) between BPL registered and 
non-registered families of adolescent girls (Table 1).

Among families of pregnant women, 6 out of 9 assets assessed 
showed no significant differences (p>0.05) between BPL registered 
and non-registered. Furthermore, 2% of the families of BPL 
registrants (2/108) had an annual income greater than 100,000 INR 
(~1000 GBP), 27.8% had more than 5 acres of land (30/108), and 
8.4% had three/four wheeler vehicles (9/108).
Discussion
Non-eligible families holding the BPL registration are likely to 
increase burden on healthcare services, while those with greatest 
need may remain untreated due to absence of BPL registration, or 
inability to pay for healthcare services out of their own pockets2,8. 
Subsidising non-eligible BPL holders also increases the burden on 
government finances, which in light of the current fragile economic 
situation, is an important issue to address8.
We observed several participants from both study groups in the 
MAS, who appeared eligible for the BPL scheme, but had not 
obtained the registration. Many participants reported technical dif-
ficulties as the reason for not having BPL registration. Some of 
these technical difficulties included having problems procuring the 
required documents from government officials, and being unable 
to complete paperwork and other legal documents that are needed 
to submit the BPL application. This suggests a need to re-evaluate 
and strengthen the current BPL registration system, and also 
demands further monitoring to ensure that poor families in need 
receive vital healthcare and other subsidy benefits. The National 
Health Mission’s initiatives are well meant and have the potential 
to provide universal health coverage in India; however, implemen-
tation is challenging. Strengthening the current BPL registration 
system and improving identification of poor and needy families 
might help with achieving the universal health model. This may 
also help in revising the current health budget to allocate funds 
for the improvement of the governmental health system. We wel-
come the review from Patel et al. (2015) and suggest continuing 
evaluation of both national health projects and the BPL registration 
process, which will be useful in underpinning healthcare facilities 
whilst widening access.

adolescent girls and pregnant women received a standardised 
health report including information on their haemoglobin level 
and anaemia status along with facilitated access to educational 
materials on anaemia through the health NGO, Halo Medical 
Foundation’s (HMF) village based services. Participant health 
reports were also provided to the village health worker/government 
nurse with arrangements for free consultation and assistance if any 
significant health problems requiring further assessment or treat-
ment were identified during the study. HMF’s hospital was also 
made available for free consultation as a primary referral centre if 
more specialist assessment or treatment was needed. On comple-
tion of data collection, an additional reminder letter was issued to 
village health workers indicating details of each severe anaemic 
case in their village to ensure that necessary medical advice and 
treatment was available.

It’s an interesting and valid research tapping the vital topic of distribution of BPL cards in India. 
Overall methodology of the research is sound. 
 
There are certain issues which require clarification from authors
The assets considered for issuing BPL cards in Maharashtra state are quite different from 
assets considered in the present study ( For details follow this link 
http://mahafood.gov.in/website/english/PDS.aspx). These differences should be considered 
before making recommendations about policy change in BPL card distribution. 
 
1. 
Authors state that “Overall, of the 6 assets we assessed, 3 showed no significant differences in 
distribution (p>0.05) between BPL registered and non-registered families of adolescent girls 
(Table 1).” But all the three assets which didn’t show significant difference are not listed in 
criteria to issue BPL Cards as per Maharashtra State. 
 
2. 
Table 1 shows that about 44% of Non-BPL holders don’t have farming land which is far more 
than BPL card holders where only 21% don’t have farming land. However, in Table 2 it’s just 
opposite where 16.7% Non-BPL holders and 36.1 % BPL holders don’t have farming land. 
This contradicting finding needs to be justified in the discussion. 
 
3. 
Why different assets were considered for adolescent girls (5 assets) and pregnant women (9 
assets). 
 
4. 
What is the necessity to stratify the analysis for adolescent girls and pregnant women 
separately? Authors could have clubbed the data and did the analysis which will increase the 
power of the study.

The sample for the present study consists of households having adolescent girls and 
pregnant women which will limit the generalizability of the study findings. Hence, the issue 
of generalizability of study findings should be discussed. 
 
6. 
In the discussion, it is necessary to discuss study limitations and future scope of doing 
research on this topic.

Dear Dr Wadgave and Dr Khairnar,  
 
Thank you for your valuable time to review our research article. I have provided a brief 
response to your comments below.  
 
Regarding comment 1, 2, 4, 6 and 7: This paper used a retrospective dataset available from 
Maharashtra Anaemia Study, where the primary objective was to identify risk factors 
associated with adolescent and pregnancy anaemia in rural population of Maharashtra 
state of India. We had limited data on social class and family assets, which was used against 
the BPL status in the analysis. We agree that our variables are different compared to the 
listed BPL indicators. Nevertheless, our data reported discrepancies in the current BPL 
status, which is an incidental finding. We suggested to investigate the current challenges in 
the BPL administration to ensure appropriate allocation and monitoring. We have not 
suggested any policy changes based on our research. We acknowledge limitations of our 
study, and further work is necessary to address the outlined challenges. Due to article 
length restrictions, we could not add more on the study strengths and limitations. We hope 
that readers will find this comment section useful for additional clarification.  
 
Regarding comment 3: The article has only one table (Table 1). In this table, there are 2 
sections, adolescent girls and pregnant women. Each section used different variables (from 
2 individual datasets). Therefore, statistical presentations are different as presented in the 
Table 1 for each study group. 
 
Regarding comment 5: As you may see in the attached datasets, we collected different set 
of variables from study participants, thus analysis was conducted independently for the two 
study groups. Data from pregnant women had more variables compared to adolescent girl 
dataset. Therefore, we could not combine these to form a single source.  
 
I hope that F1000Research readers will find this section useful. Thank you once again for 
providing this opportunity to respond to your comments.  
 
Dr Anand Ahankari

Authors had given importance of subject appropriately, clarified ethical considerations, self-
explanatory results and well discussion on the issue.   
 
The authors pinpointed the below poverty line (BPL) issue in the form of non-eligible BPL 
registrants and eligible BPL non-registrants. The article raise the following questions:
Undue healthcare advantage taken by non-eligible BPL registrants
1. 
Disadvantage to needy eligible BPL families due to their non-registration.
2. 
Suggestions given for above mentioned questions are very much relevant and if implemented will 
help to reduce burden on government and healthcare finances as well.
