Abstract 
Background:  In animals, H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 are enriched at the transcription start site (TSS) and function as 
epigenetic marks that regulate gene transcription, but their functions in plants have not been fully characterized.
Results:  We used chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing to analyze the rice genome-wide changes to 
H3K4me1/H3K4me2/H3K4me3 following the loss of an H3K4-specific methyltransferase, SDG701. The knockdown of 
SDG701 resulted in a global decrease in H3K4me2/H3K4me3 levels throughout the rice genome. An RNA-sequencing 
analysis revealed that many genes related to diverse developmental processes were misregulated in the SDG701 
knockdown mutant. In rice, H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 are positively correlated with gene transcription; however, 
surprisingly, the H3K4me2 level was negatively associated with gene transcription levels. Furthermore, the H3K4me3 
level at the TSS region decreased significantly in the genes that exhibited down-regulated expression in the SDG701 
knockdown mutant. In contrast, the genes with up-regulated expression in the mutant were associated with a con‑
siderable decrease in H3K4me2 levels over the gene body region.
Conclusion:  A comparison of the genome-wide distributions of H3K4me2 in eukaryotes indicated that the H3K4me2 
level is not correlated with the gene transcription level in yeast, but is positively and negatively correlated with gene 
expression in animals and plants, respectively. Our results uncovered H3K4me2 as a novel repressive mark in plants.

Background
In eukaryotes, histone lysine (K) methylation is impor-
tant for regulating gene expression. The K-residues at the 
N-terminus of histone H3 or H4 can be mono-, di-, or 
tri-methylated, and the methylation of a specific K-resi-
due as well as the number of methyl groups added can 
mark different chromatin states [1–3]. The methylations 
of H3K4 and H3K36 are generally associated with gene 
transcriptional activation, whereas the methylations of 
H3K9 and H3K27 are associated with the repression of 
gene expression [4–7].
As an evolutionarily conserved epigenetic mark, H3K4 
methylations are broadly distributed in euchromatin and 
are associated with actively transcribed genes in ani-
mals and plants [2, 8–10]. Studies involving chromatin 
immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-chip and ChIP-sequencing 
(ChIP-seq) technologies have provided insights into the 
distributions and functions of H3K4me1/H3K4me2/
H3K4me3 in various species. In yeast (Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae), H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 appear at about 
600 base pairs (bp) downstream of the transcription start 
site (TSS), whereas H3K4me3 is primarily enriched at 
200 bp downstream of the nucleosome-free region [11]. 
In animals, H3K4me1/H3K4me2/H3K4me3 is enriched 
on both sides of the TSS, with a similar distribution pat-
tern across the genome [12–14]. Additionally, H3K4me1

is globally associated with enhancers [15] and H3K4me2/
H3K4me3 usually positively regulates gene expression in 
animals [8–10]. Similarly, in Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza 
sativa), H3K4me3 is enriched close to the TSS region and 
is positively correlated with gene expression levels [4, 
16–18]. However, there has been some inconsistency in 
the reported H3K4me2 distribution pattern, with some 
studies indicating that the distribution pattern is similar 
to that of H3K4me3 [4, 16], whereas other studies have 
suggested that H3K4me2 is broadly distributed across 
the gene body region, in contrast to H3K4me3 [17, 18]. 
Moreover, the relationship between H3K4me2 and gene 
expression levels in plants remains unclear [4, 16–18].
The methylation of H3K4 is catalyzed by SET domain-
containing methyltransferases. In yeast, Set1 is the sole 
H3K4-specific methyltransferase [19, 20] and functions 
as part of the COMPASS (complex proteins associated 
with Set1) complex together with the other subunits, 
Swd1, Swd2, Swd3, Bre2, Sdc1, Spp1, and Shg1 [21, 22]. 
Drosophila melanogaster contains three Set1 homologs 
[dSet1, Trithorax (Trx), and Trx-related protein], all of 
which can associate with the other subunit proteins to 
form COMPASS-like complexes, which are responsi-
ble for the methylation of H3K4 [23]. Mammals have six 
Set1 homologs [SET1A, SET1B, MLL1, MLL2, MLL3, 
and MLL4] [8], which also usually exist in COMPASS-
like complexes for methylating H3K4 [24–26]. In Arabi-
dopsis, ATX1–5 function as H3K4 methyltransferases. 
Additionally, ATX1 is involved in root, leaf, and floral 
organ development [27–30]. Previous studies revealed 
that ATX1 and ATX2 are functionally diverse, with ATX2 
exhibiting H3K4me2 rather than H3K4me3 activity [31, 
32]. Moreover, ATX3–5 has redundant functions affect-
ing vegetative and reproductive developmental processes 
and the genome-wide distribution of H3K4me2 and 
H3K4me3 [33]. In rice, SDG723/OsTrx1 exhibits his-
tone H3 methyltransferase activity in vitro and helps to 
regulate flowering time [34]. The OsTrx1 protein is spe-
cifically recruited to the target gene Ehd1 to promote 
rice flowering by interacting with a transcription factor, 
SDG723/OsTrx1/OsSET33 Interaction Protein 1 (SIP1) 
[35]. SDG701 is likely a major H3K4-specific methyl-
transferase in rice, thereby contributing to the regula-
tion of multiple processes during rice plant growth and 
development, such as flowering, gametophyte develop-
ment, and grain production [36].
In this study, we functionally characterized the 
H3K4 methylation marks (H3K4me1, H3K4me2, and 
H3K4me3) in rice by analyzing the SDG701 knockdown 
mutant in RNA-seq and ChIP-seq assays, for the SDG701 
knockout mutant is lethal [36]. The SDG701 deficiency 
decreased the global H3K4me2/H3K4me3 levels in 
planta and resulted in the misregulation of many genes 
involved in multiple developmental processes. Interest-
ingly, unlike the H3K4me1/H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 
marks, which were positively correlated with gene tran-
scription, H3K4me2 was negatively correlated with gene 
expression. Moreover, H3K4me2 levels were consider-
ably decreased in the genes that exhibited up-regulated 
expression in the SDG701 knockdown mutant, further 
supporting a novel function of H3K4me2 to repress gene 
expression in rice.
Results
SDG701 is required for the proper expression of many 
genes involved in diverse developmental processes
We previously reported SDG701 functions as a major 
H3K4-specific methyltransferase that is important for 
rice plant development [36]. To further clarify the func-
tion of SDG701, we conducted an RNA-sequencing 
(RNA-seq) analysis of the SDG701 knockdown mutant 
35Sp::SDG701iR1 (hereafter referred to as 701Ri-1-5) in 
the O. sativa spp. japonica cv. Nipponbare (NIP) back-
ground. After sequencing two biological replicates of 
RNA-seq libraries, more than 20 million mapped reads 
were obtained for a subsequent evaluation of genes 
that were differentially expressed between the 701Ri-
1-5 mutant and the wild-type NIP (Additional file  1: 
Table S1). As expected, the transcription level of SDG701 
(LOC_Os08g08210) decreased to half in the 701Ri-1-
5 mutant ­(FPKM701Ri-1-5/FPKMNIP = 0.50, adjusted p 
value = 5.72e−4), while that of LOC_Os08g08200, a gene 
adjacent to SDG701, was unaffected (Fig. 1a). We previ-
ously demonstrated that SDG701 influences the expres-
sion of the flowering genes Hd3a, Ehd1, and RFT1 [36]. 
Thus, the RNA-seq data were analyzed to determine the 
expression levels of these genes. Consistent with our pre-
vious results [36], the Hd3a, Ehd1, and RFT1 expression

levels were significantly lower in the 701Ri-1-5 mutant 
than in the wild-type NIP (Additional file 1: Fig. S1).
An analysis of the RNA-seq data revealed 1572 and 
1508 genes whose transcription levels were up- and 
down-regulated by more than 1.5-fold in the 701Ri-1-5 
mutant, respectively (Fig. 1b, Additional file 2: Table S2). 
A gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis indicated 
that the misregulated genes in the 701Ri-1-5 mutant 
were enriched with multiple biological process GO 
terms, including metabolic process, biosynthetic pro-
cess, response to biotic or abiotic stimuli, organ develop-
ment, and signal transduction (Fig. 1c, Additional file 3: 
Table S3). Additionally, some of the misregulated genes 
in the 701Ri-1-5 mutant were related to flower develop-
ment, the starch biosynthetic process, and pollen devel-
opment (Additional file 3: Table S3), which is consistent 
with the fact that SDG701 affects gametophyte develop-
ment and grain production [36]. These results imply that 
SDG701 is required for the proper expression of many 
genes and is crucial for multiple developmental processes 
in rice.
H3K4me2 enrichment is negatively correlated 
with transcription levels in rice
In rice, SDG701 is an H3K4-methyltransferase that is espe-
cially important for the tri-methylation of H3K4, and the 
resulting H3K4me3 serves as an active epigenetic mark for 
gene transcription in eukaryotes. We were interested in why 
many genes exhibited increased expression in the SDG701 
knockdown mutant. We first performed a ChIP-seq analy-
sis to assess whether the knockdown of SDG701 affected 
H3K4 methylations. Approximately 4–20 million unique 
reads were obtained for H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, 
and H3K36me3 in the 701Ri-1-5 mutant and wild-type NIP 
(Additional file 1: Table S4 and Fig. 2a). In NIP, 284 (0.5% 
of 55,986 annotated rice genes), 10,681 (19.1%), and 25,259 
(45.1%) genes enriched with H3K4me1, H3K4me2, and 
H3K4me3, respectively, were identified (Additional file  1: 
Fig. S2A). Another 15,728 genes enriched with H3K36me3 
were also detected. The peaks for enriched H3K4me2, 
H3K4me3, and H3K36me3 overlapped previously pub-
lished ChIP-seq data (Additional file 1: Fig. S2B–D) [37–39]. 
As shown in Fig.  2, H3K4me1 was distributed over the 
gene body region at a much lower level than H3K4me2 and 
H3K4me3, H3K4me2 covered the entire gene body region 
with a weak peak close to the TSS, whereas H3K4me3 
showed a sharp peak at the TSS in the wild-type NIP. As 
a control, H3K36me3 was mainly distributed at the 5′ end 
of the gene body, which was consistent with our published 
data [40].
In the SDG701 knockdown mutant, the H3K4me1 level 
decreased slightly, especially close to the TSS region, while 
the H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 levels decreased obviously 
(Fig.  2b). The ChIP-seq data further confirmed that 
SDG701 is responsible for methylating H3K4, especially 
the di- and tri-methylation of H3K4 in rice (Fig.  2). We 
observed that the H3K36me3 level decreased very slightly 
close to the TSS in the 701Ri-1-5 mutant (Fig.  2b). We 
wondered whether this decrease was directly due to the 
knockdown of SDG701. Because the H3K4me1-enriched 
genes accounted for 0.5% of all annotated rice genes, we 
only selected H3K4me2-, H3K4me3-, and H3K36me3-
enriched genes for further analyses. These genes were 
grouped into the following seven clusters based on their 
surrounding epigenetic marks (Additional file  1: Fig. 
S3A): (a) enriched with only H3K4me2, (b) enriched with 
Fig. 2  Knockdown of SDG701 results in a global decrease in

only H3K4me3, (c) enriched with only H3K36me3, (d) 
enriched with H3K4me2 and H3K4me3, (e) enriched with 
H3K4me2 and H3K36me3, (f) enriched with H3K4me3 
and H3K36me3, and (g) enriched with H3K4me2, 
H3K4me3, and H3K36me3. Heatmaps and average density 
plots were generated for these genes in NIP and the 701Ri-
1-5 mutant (Additional file 1: Fig. S3B–E). The H3K4me2 
and H3K4me3 signals were significantly decreased for the 
genes in clusters a and b, respectively; however, the enrich-
ment of H3K36me3 in the genes of cluster c was unaf-
fected, indicating that SDG701 did not directly contribute 
to the decrease in the H3K36me3 level in the 701Ri-1-5 
mutant. Regarding the genes in cluster f (enriched with 
H3K4me3/H3K36me3) and cluster g (enriched with 
H3K4me2/H3K4me3/H3K36me3), the H3K36me3 sig-
nal decreased slightly close to the TSS, implying that the 
decrease in the H3K36me3 level in the 701Ri-1-5 mutant 
was probably related to a decrease in the H3K4me3 level. 
These results suggested that the knockdown of SDG701 in 
rice leads to a genome-wide decrease in H3K4 methyla-
tions, especially the di- and tri-methylations.
We subsequently explored the correlation between 
H3K4 methylations and transcript levels by analyzing 
the RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data for the wild-type NIP. 
About 90% of the H3K4me3/H3K36me3-enriched genes 
(cluster f) were expressed (FPKM > 1; Fig.  3a). Unex-
pectedly, over 80% of the H3K4me2-enriched genes 
(cluster a) were not expressed (0 < FPKM < 1; Fig.  3a). 
We also observed that if gene groups were marked with 
H3K4me2, the fraction of expressed genes decreased. For 
example, approximately 60% of the H3K4me3-enriched 
genes were expressed, whereas only about 30% of the 
H3K4me2/H3K4me3-enriched genes were expressed 
(Fig.  3a). Similarly, more than 60% of the H3K36me3-
enriched genes were expressed, while less than 30% of the 
H3K4me2/H3K36me3-enriched genes were expressed 
(Fig. 3a). Next, we analyzed the expression levels of the 
seven gene clusters (Fig. 3b). The mean expression level 
of the H3K4me3/H3K36me3-enriched genes was the 
highest, and that of the H3K4me2-enriched genes was 
the lowest (Fig. 3b, Additional file 1: Table S5). Moreover, 
a comparison of the seven clusters revealed that the aver-
age expression levels were obviously lower for the genes 
marked with H3K4me2 than for the genes that lacked 
H3K4me2 (Fig. 3b, Additional file 1: Table S5), suggesting 
that H3K4me2 is probably related to gene repression.
To further validate our results, we classified all anno-
tated rice genes into the following four groups based 
on the FPKM values: Non: not expressed, 0 < FPKM < 1; 
Low: low expression level, 1 < FPKM < 2; Middle: moder-
ate expression level, 2 < FPKM < 10; High: high expression 
level, FPKM > 10. Additionally, average density plots for 
H3K4me1/H3K4me2/H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 were 
generated for these four gene groups (Fig.  3c). A posi-
tive correlation was observed between the transcript lev-
els and the H3K4me1, H3K4me3, and H3K36me3 levels 
(Fig.  3c, d). In contrast, the H3K4me2 level was nega-
tively correlated with the transcript level, just similar as 
the relationship between H3K27me3 and gene transcrip-
tion (Additional file  1: Fig. S4). Specifically, H3K4me3 
(ρ = 0.85) and H3K36me3 (ρ = 0.96) levels were positively 
correlated with gene transcription levels. A weaker posi-
tive correlation was detected between H3K4me1 levels 
(ρ = 0.73) and gene transcription levels. Consistent with 
the results for H3K4me2 in NIP (ρ = -0.88), we detected 
a negative correlation between gene transcription levels 
and H3K4me2 enrichment in another rice subspecies, O. 
sativa ssp. japonica cv. Dongjin (ρ = − 0.89; Additional 
file 1: Fig. S5). Our results proved that unlike H3K4me3 
and H3K36me3 modifications, H3K4me2 is negatively 
correlated with transcript level in rice.
H3K4me2 enrichment significantly decreases 
within the chromatin of the up‑regulated genes in SDG701 
knockdown mutant
To further test the correlation between H3K4 methyla-
tions and gene transcription, we analyzed the H3K4me1/
H3K4me2/H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 signals for the 
misregulated genes in the 701Ri-1-5 mutant. Addition-
ally, average density plots were generated to visualize 
the H3K4me1/H3K4me2/H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 
distribution patterns on genes that exhibited signifi-
cantly up-regulated (1572 genes), down-regulated (1508 
genes), or unchanged expression levels in NIP and the 
701Ri-1-5 mutant (Figs. 1b and 4). There were no obvi-
ous differences between NIP and the 701Ri-1-5 mutant 
regarding the H3K4me1 and H3K36me3 signals on the 
up- and down-regulated genes (Fig. 4a, d), indicating that 
the gene transcription changes in the 701Ri-1-5 mutant 
were not due to changes in H3K4me1 or H3K36me3 
enrichment. The H3K4me2 level over the whole gene 
body regions of the 1572 up-regulated genes was signifi-
cantly lower in the 701Ri-1-5 mutant than in NIP, while 
the corresponding level of the down-regulated genes 
was only slightly lower close to the TSS in the 701Ri-1-5 
mutant than in NIP (Fig. 4b). We randomly selected eight 
genes, whose H3K4me2 levels significantly decreased 
and transcript levels increased, respectively, in 701Ri-
1-5 compared to in NIP for independent validation. The 
RT-qPCR and ChIP-qPCR results further supported that 
the decreased H3K4me2 correlates with gene activation 
(Additional file 1: Fig. S6). Regarding the H3K4me3 level, 
a significant decrease was observed for both up- and 
down-regulated genes (Fig. 4c). Moreover, the H3K4me3 
signal for the down-regulated genes was mainly a sharp 
peak close to the TSS, while that for the up-regulated 
Page 6 of 14
Liu et al. Epigenetics & Chromatin           (2019) 12:40 
genes was a smaller peak around the TSS and extended to 
the entire gene body region. Our data indicated that the 
genes exhibiting up-regulated expression in the 701Ri-1-
5 mutant had a significantly decreased H3K4me2 level, 
providing further evidence that H3K4me2 represses gene 
transcription in rice.
Correlation between H3K4me2/H3K4me3 deposition 
and gene transcription
To clarify the relationship between H3K4me2/H3K4me3 
enrichment and gene transcription levels regulated 
by SDG701, we screened for genes with H3K4me2 or 
H3K4me3 levels that were significantly lower in the 
Fig. 3  H3K4me2 level is negatively correlated with the gene transcription level in rice. a Genes marked by H3K4me2 only, H3K4me3 only, 
H3K36me3 only, H3K4me2 and H3K4me3, H3K4me2 and H3K36me3, or H3K4me2, H3K4me3, and H3K36me3 exhibited varying transcription 
levels in the wild-type NIP. Genes categorized by transcription levels (FPKM values) are distinguished by different colors. b Box plots presenting the

levels. Non: not expressed, 0 < FPKM < 1 (black); Low: low expression level, 1 < FPKM < 2 (green); Middle: moderate expression level, 2 < FPKM < 10 
(gray); and High: high expression level, FPKM > 10 (red). d Scatter plots presenting the relationship between H3K4me1/H3K4me2/H3K4me3 and

levels were calculated as follows: ChIP-seq normalized read density−input normalized read density for expressed genes (FPKM > 1). Spearman’s rank 
correlation coefficient indicates the correlation between the methylation level and the gene expression level. The p value was determined based on

1885 peaks and 14,647 peaks, corresponding to 1968 of

level, Peak Set 4 containing 4737 peaks with significantly 
decreased H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 levels, and Peak Set 
5 containing 643 peaks with a significantly decreased 
H3K4me2 level and an unchanged H3K4me3 level. In 
the wild-type NIP, the H3K4me2 levels were higher for 
the genes in Peak Sets 4 and 5 than for the genes in Peak 
Sets 1–3, and the H3K4me3 levels were higher for the 
genes in Peak Sets 1–4 than for the genes in Peak Set 5 
(Fig.  5b). Next, we conducted an enrichment analysis 
of the genes in Peak Sets 1–5 and the genes that exhib-
ited up- or down-regulated expression in the 701Ri-1-5 
mutant. The corresponding genes of Peak Set 1 and Peak 
Set 2 were more significantly enriched in the genes with 
down-regulated expression than those with up-regu-
lated expression in 701Ri-1-5 mutant (Fig. 5c). In these 
two peak sets, only H3K4me3 levels were significantly 
decreased in the 701Ri-1-5 mutant (Fig.  5a), suggest-
ing that the decrease in the H3K4me3 level is primarily 
responsible for down-regulating gene expression in rice. 
Meanwhile, the genes of Peak Set 5 were more signifi-
cantly enriched in the genes with up-regulated expres-
sion in 701Ri-1-5 mutant (Fig.  5c), indicating that the 
decrease in the H3K4me2 level is mainly related to gene 
activation in rice. Thus, H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 are 
apparently positively and negatively associated with rice 
gene transcription, respectively. Regarding the genes of 
Peak Sets 3 and 4, we observed that for the genes with 
up-regulated expression, H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 were 
mainly distributed over the whole gene body, whereas 
for the genes with down-regulated expression, H3K4me2 
and H3K4me3 produced a peak close to the TSS in NIP, 
especially the genes of Peak Set 4 (Additional file 1: Fig. 
S8). These results suggested that the relative positions of 
H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 along genes probably also con-
tribute to the regulation of gene expression.
Evolutionary diversity of H3K4me2 distributions 
and functions in various species
The negative correlation between H3K4me2 enrichment 
and gene transcription levels compelled us to analyze 
the H3K4me2 distribution in various species. Heatmaps 
(Fig. 6a) and average density plots (Fig. 6b) of H3K4me2 
were generated for genes from 3 kb upstream of the TSS 
to 3  kb downstream of the transcription termination 
site (TTS). We determined that H3K4me2 was mainly 
enriched from 500  bp upstream of the TSS to 500  bp 
downstream of the TTS in S. cerevisiae, but was not 
obviously correlated with gene transcription (Fig. 6a–c), 
which is consistent with published data [41]. In Caeno-
rhabditis elegans, H3K4me2 was primarily enriched 
around the TSS and was positively correlated with gene 
expression (Fig. 6a–c). In D. melanogaster, the H3K4me2 
levels on each side of the TSS were also positively 
correlated with gene expression (Fig. 6a–c). In a human 
colon cancer cell line (HCT116 cells) and mouse embry-
onic stem cells, H3K4me2 was sharply enriched around 
the TSS and was positively correlated with gene expres-
sion (Fig. 6a–c). Similar to rice, the H3K4me2 in Arabi-
dopsis was mainly enriched in gene body regions and was 
negatively related to gene expression (Fig. 6a–c). Unlike 
H3K4me2, H3K4me3 exhibited a conserved positive cor-
relation with gene transcription in various species (Addi-
tional file  1: Fig. S9). Thus, the H3K4me2 distribution 
patterns are diverse among various species. Moreover, in 
contrast to in animals, H3K4me2 exhibits a unique dis-
tribution pattern and functions as a repressive epigenetic 
mark in plants.
Discussion
In this study, we observed that the genome-wide levels of 
H3K4 modifications, especially H3K4me2 and H3K4me3, 
were significantly lower in the SDG701 knockdown 
mutant than in the wild-type NIP. Our RNA-seq analy-
sis revealed that the knockdown of SDG701 results in 
more genes with up-regulated expression than genes 
with down-regulated expression, which is inconsistent 
with the fact that SDG701 functions as an H3K4-specific 
methyltransferase that catalyzes the epigenetic modifi-
cations that activate gene expression. Surprisingly, our 
combined analysis of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data indi-
cated that in rice, H3K4me2 enrichment is negatively cor-
related with gene transcript level, which differs from the 
positive association between H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 
levels and gene expression levels. In the SDG701 knock-
down mutant, the down-regulated genes were associated 
with a decreased H3K4me3 level close to the TSS region, 
while the up-regulated genes were associated with a 
decreased H3K4me2 level over the gene body region. A 
further analysis of published H3K4me2/me3 ChIP-seq 
and RNA-seq raw data for various species indicated that 
unlike in animals, H3K4me2 in rice and Arabidopsis spe-
cifically distributes over the gene body region and func-
tions as a repressive epigenetic mark.
Although H3K4me2 serves as a repressive mark on 
chromatin in plants, it was unclear whether it is more 
common in euchromatin or heterochromatin. We 
observed that more than 90% of the genes marked with 
H3K4me2 are not transposable element (non-TE) genes 
(Additional file 1: Fig. S10A), suggesting that H3K4me2 
occurs mainly on euchromatin in plants. We also ana-
lyzed the relationship between H3K4me2 and other 
repressive epigenetic marks in rice, including DNA meth-
ylations (CG, CHG, and CHH), H3K9me1/H3K9me2/
H3K9me3, and H3K27me3 [42, 43]. We observed that 
the genes marked with H3K4me2 overlapped less with 
those marked with DNA methylations or with H3K9me1/
Page 10 of 14
Liu et al. Epigenetics & Chromatin           (2019) 12:40 
H3K9me2/H3K9me3, but more with the genes marked 
with H3K27me3 (Additional file  1: Fig. S10B–F). Thus, 
H3K4me2 probably functions together with H3K27me3 
to inhibit the expression of euchromatin genes in plants. 
Regarding the mechanism underlying the gene repression 
function of H3K4me2, one possibility is that H3K4me2 
helps to recruit a repressive reader protein. Consistent 
with this possibility, the rice DNA-binding domain 
(CHD) protein CHR729 reportedly can bind to both 
H3K4me2 and H3K27me3 in vitro through its PHD fin-
ger domain [44]. Homologs of CHR729 (CHD3 subfam-
ily) in D. melanogaster and mammals are the key subunits 
of NuRD complexes, which exhibit nucleosome remod-
eling and deacetylase activities and repress transcription

[45, 46]. Future studies will need to reveal the molecular 
mechanisms regulating H3K4me2 functions that repress 
gene expression in plants.
In the SDG701 knockdown mutant, 597 genes exhib-
ited up-regulated expression probably due to the 
decrease in the H3K4me2 level. More than 30% of the 597 
genes are involved in plant responses to various factors, 
including stress, abiotic and biotic stimuli, endogenous 
stimuli, cold conditions, and wounding (Additional file 5: 
Table  S7). Additionally, SDG701-mediated H3K4me2 
appears to have a substantial role in plant adaptive 
responses to changing environmental conditions. Spe-
cifically, SDG701 can establish two epigenetic marks 
with distinct functions, H3K4me3 and H3K4me2, which 
activate and repress transcription, respectively. The data 
presented herein suggest there exists a new layer of com-
plexity to histone methylation functions regarding the 
remodeling of chromatin. The enhanced flexibility of the 
chromatin remodeling function to regulate gene expres-
sion may be advantageous for plants because of the high 
plasticity of their growth and development and the fact 
they must be able to adapt to adverse environmental con-
ditions because they are sessile organisms.
Conclusion
We characterized the novel function of H3K4me2 in rice: 
different from the positive correlation between H3K4me3 
level and gene expression level, H3K4me2 level is nega-
tively correlated with gene transcription level. A single 
enzyme SDG701 can establish two epigenetic marks with 
distinct functions, suggesting the complexity of histone 
methylations to enhance the flexibility of the chroma-
tin and the plasticity of the environmental adaption in 
plants.
Materials and methods
Plant materials and growth conditions
The SDG701 knockdown mutant 35Sp::SDG701iR1 
(701Ri-1-5) in the O. sativa spp. japonica cv. Nippon-
bare background used in this study has been previously 
described [36]. For the RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analyses, 
rice seedlings were grown in growth chambers under 
short-day photoperiod conditions [10-h light (30 °C):14-h 
dark (28 °C)].
Library construction and sequencing
To be able to compare the RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data, 
the same set of rice samples were used to extract the total 
RNA used to prepare the RNA-seq and ChIP-seq librar-
ies. Total RNA was extracted from 30-day-old shoots 
with the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). A strand-specific 
RNA-seq library was constructed as previously described 
[47]. Additionally, ChIP assays were completed as 
previously described [48], with the following antibodies: 
anti-monomethyl-H3K4 (Millipore), anti-dimethyl-H3K4 
(Millipore), anti-trimethyl-H3K4 (Millipore), and anti-
trimethyl-H3K36 (Abcam, Shanghai, China). The DNA 
resulting from a ChIP experiment and the input con-
trol were used to construct a ChIP-seq library as previ-
ously described [6]. The sequencing of the ChIP-seq and 
RNA-seq libraries generated 51-bp single-end reads and 
101-bp paired-end reads, respectively. Details regarding 
the ChIP-seq and RNA-seq mapping are summarized in 
Additional file 1: Tables S1 and S4, respectively.
RNA‑seq analysis
More than 30-million high-quality raw reads were 
obtained from the sequencing of the RNA-seq library 
and were analyzed as previously described [49]. Briefly, 
the TopHat2 (version 2.0.13) [50] and Cufflinks (ver-
sion 2.2.1) [51] programs were used to identify genes 
that were differentially expressed between the 701Ri-1-
5 mutant and NIP. Significantly differentially expressed 
genes were defined based on the combined thresholds 
of > 1.5-fold change in expression level and an adjusted 
p < 0.05. A volcano plot was subsequently generated with 
the ggplot2 package [52] of the R software. To visualize 
the RNA-seq data, the mapping files from TopHat (ver-
sion 2.0.13) were converted to BEDGRAPH format files 
with BEDTools (version 2.17.0) [53]. The BEDGRAPH 
format files were analyzed with the IGV (version 2.3.88) 
genome browser [54].
ChIP‑seq analysis
The raw data were mapped to the reference Nipponbare 
(japonica) rice genome (MSU7; http://rice.plant​biolo​
gy.msu.edu) with the Bowtie (version 0.7.15) program 
[55], and SAMtools was used to extract the unique and 
non-redundant mapped reads [56]. The non-redundant 
mapped reads were subsequently analyzed.
To examine the global distributions of H3K4me1/
H3K4me2/H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, each gene (from 
the TSS to the TTS) longer than 500  bp was divided 
into 300 bins, and 1000 bp regions upstream of the TSS 
and downstream of the TTS for each gene were divided 
into 50 bins. The read number for each bin was calcu-
lated with BEDTools (version 2.17.0) [53], and the read 
coverage of each sample was normalized to 10 million 
reads and calibrated against the input control. All aggre-
gated plots and heatmaps were generated with the R 
software. BED format files were produced from mapped 
files with BEDTools (version 2.17.0) [53]. Addition-
ally, SICER.sh from the SICER (version 1.1) software 
[57] was used to identify histone methylation enrich-
ment regions (peaks) by comparing the ChIP library 
with the input library (parameters: W = 200, G = 200, 
Page 12 of 14
Liu et al. Epigenetics & Chromatin           (2019) 12:40 
and FDR < 1e−2 for H3K4me1 and H3K4me2; W = 200, 
G = 600, and FDR < 1e−2 for H3K4me3 and H3K36me3). 
Peaks were considered significant if they satisfied the 
following thresholds: FDR < 1e−3 and IP DNA/input 
DNA ≥ 2. Moreover, SICER-df.sh was used to com-
pare the differences in H3K4me2/H3K4me3 between 
the 701iR1-5 mutant and NIP. The following thresholds 
were used to determine whether peak changes were sig-
nificant: FDR < 1e−4 and > 1.5-fold change (wild type/
mutant ≥ 1.5). The ChIPpeakAnno package [58] from 
Bioconductor (http://www.bioco​nduct​or.org) was used 
for annotating peaks. Genes (including the 1000  bp 
region upstream of the TSS) that overlapped with the 
peaks of various histone modifications were considered 
as modification-enriched genes.
Gene ontology and plant ontology analysis
For the GO enrichment analysis, we analyzed the genes 
that exhibited down- or up-regulated expression in the 
701iR1-5 mutant with the CARMO online tool, which is 
a comprehensive annotation platform for the functional 
exploration of rice multi-omics data (http://bioin​fo.sibs.
ac.cn/carmo​/Gene_Annot​ation​.php) [59]. The signifi-
cantly enriched biological processes among the differen-
tially expressed genes (p < 0.05) were analyzed.

DNA 
methylation, 
H3K9me1/
H3K9me2/H3K9me3, H3K27me3, H3K4me2/H3K4me3 
ChIP-seq, and related gene transcription data for vari-
ous species from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) data-
base 
(https​://trace​.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Trace​s/sra/sra/). 
The SRA files were converted to FASTQ files with the 
fastq-dump package in the SRAToolkit (version 2.9.0) 
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Trace​s/sra/?view=toolk​
it_doc). Distribution plots and heatmaps were gener-
ated with deepTools (version 2.0) [60]. The gene expres-
sion matrices of the other species, except for S. cerevisiae, 
were downloaded from the GEO database. The FPKM 
value of each S. cerevisiae gene was calculated with the 
DESeq2 package [61]. Additionally, raw DNA methyla-
tion data were re-analyzed with BatMeth package [62]. 
The accession numbers of the sequences analyzed in 
this study are as follows: GSE95356 (H3K4me2/me3) 
and GSE73406 (RNA) for S. cerevisiae [11]; GSE49733

and H3K27me3) [42] and GSE19602 (DNA methylations) 
for rice [37].
RNA extraction and RT‑qPCR analysis
According to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitro-
gen), RNA was isolated with TRI Reagent using the same 
method described in RNA-seq. Reverse transcription 
was performed with Improm-II reverse transcriptase 
(Promega), and quantitative polymerase chain reaction 
(qPCR) was performed using specific primers listed in 
Additional file  1: Table  S8, and Ubiquitin5 (Ubq5) was 
used as an internal reference gene for normalization [36].
ChIP‑qPCR analysis
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were per-
formed with the same method described in the library 
construction. qPCR was used to test the enrichment of 
DNA immunoprecipitated in the ChIP experiments. 
Gene-specific primers are listed in Additional file  1:
