Abstract Mean annual ground temperature (MAGT) and active layer thickness (ALT) are key to
understanding the evolution of the ground thermal state across the Arctic under climate change. Here a
statistical modeling approach is presented to forecast current and future circum-Arctic MAGT and ALT in
relation to climatic and local environmental factors, at spatial scales unreachable with contemporary
transient modeling. After deploying an ensemble of multiple statistical techniques, distance-blocked cross
validation between observations and predictions suggested excellent and reasonable transferability of the
MAGT and ALT models, respectively. The MAGT forecasts indicated currently suitable conditions for
permafrost to prevail over an area of 15.1 ± 2.8 × 106 km2. This extent is likely to dramatically contract in the
future, as the results showed consistent, but region-speciﬁc, changes in ground thermal regime due to
climate change. The forecasts provide new opportunities to assess future Arctic changes in ground thermal
state and biogeochemical feedback.
Plain Language Summary Modeling of circum-Arctic ground thermal regime is critical to better
predict the local climate change impacts on Arctic ecosystems and societies, thus supporting effective
mitigation strategies. In this study we present a new approach to create ground temperature and active layer
thickness (i.e. seasonally thawed ground layer on the top of permafrost) data layers over northern
hemisphere at unprecedented ﬁne spatial resolution (ca. 1km), that is unreachable with contemporary
models. Our data indicate currently suitable conditions for permafrost to prevail over an area of 15.1 ± 2.8 ×
106 km2. However, this extent is likely to dramatically contract in the future, as our results suggest
consistent, but region-speciﬁc, alterations in ground thermal conditions due to climate change. Our
results provide new opportunities to estimate future changes in Arctic ground thermal state, which has
important implications on greenhouse gas ﬂuxes and infrastructure hazards due to permafrost degradation.
1. Introduction
General circulation models predict global warming and associated Arctic ampliﬁcation (Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change [IPCC], 2013; Screen & Simmonds, 2010). A growing body of literature projects
alterations in ground thermal regime (mean annual ground temperature, MAGT) and active layer thickness
(ALT, seasonally thawing surface layer on top of permafrost) due to climate change (Arctic Monitoring and
Assessment Programme, 2017; Grosse et al., 2016; Hipp et al., 2012; IPCC, 2013; Koven et al., 2011). These
anticipated changes are likely to affect the functioning of Arctic ecosystems through changes in ground
ice, hydrology, and nutrient cycling (Fountain et al., 2012; Liljedahl et al., 2016; Post et al., 2009). They will
amplify climate warming through various surface-atmosphere feedback such as release of greenhouse gases
(CO2, CH4, and N2O) from warming soils and changes in ground reﬂectance (Christensen et al., 2004; Schuur
et al., 2009). Thawing of perennially frozen ground is also likely to pose threats to man-made infrastructure
with potentially severe economic consequences (Melvin et al., 2017; Nelson et al., 2001).
Ground thermal regime, and consequently permafrost occurrence, has commonly been investigated using
mechanistic transient models that are based on solving physically based equations describing processes
such as heat conductance and hydraulic movements in n-dimensional soil matrix (Gisnås et al., 2017; Guo
& Wang, 2016; Westermann et al., 2013, 2015). Whereas such models are useful tools for producing physi-
cally consistent estimates of MAGT and thus increasing the knowledge of the mechanisms controlling
ground thermal regime, they are often tedious to parameterize, computationally heavy to conduct and pro-
vide forecasts at relatively coarse spatial scales (>10 km) in hemispheric-scale explorations (Guo & Wang,
2016). Despite rapid increase in computational facilities and modeling algorithms (Westermann et al.,

2016), contemporary transient ground thermal modeling is still a trade-off between modeling resolution
and the size of geographical domain, potentially limiting their applicability in regional and/or global studies
(Etzelmüller, 2013).
Empirical techniques rely on statistical associations between dependent variable (i.e., response) and one or
multiple explanatory variables (hereafter predictors; Guisan & Zimmermann, 2000). They are increasingly
used in environmental research especially among practitioners and show high potential for modeling
ground thermal conditions over broad geographical regions (Chadburn et al., 2017; Gruber, 2012; Hjort &
Luoto, 2013). They are computationally more cost-efﬁcient than transient modeling and can readily account
for environmental conditions related to topography and land cover (data available as geographical layers)
that could be difﬁcult to physically parameterize (Etzelmüller, 2013). Statistical models are often criticized
for their correlative nature, which may (1) hinder the interpretation of the response-predictor relationships
(cf. causality) and (2) cause uncertainty when extrapolating to environmental conditions outside the range
of observation data (e.g., climate change; Heikkinen et al., 2006). Such issues can be partly controlled by
assuring that observation data cover investigated environmental gradients and by using ensembles of dif-
ferent statistical algorithms (Aalto et al., 2014; Gallien et al., 2012; Marmion et al., 2009).
Ground thermal regime is strongly coupled with average atmospheric conditions and is often characterized
by using average annual air temperature or cumulative temperature sums (e.g., freeze and thaw days;
Chadburn et al., 2017; Gruber, 2012; Smith, 1975). In addition, precipitation conditions affect ground surface
temperatures through water inﬁltration to soil column causing advective heat transfer and modifying ther-
mal properties of the soil (heat capacity and thermal conductivity; Weismüller et al., 2011; Westermann
et al., 2011). Thermal conditions in near-surface ground layers (<10–20 m) respond well to the changes
in climate at decadal level. Local environmental conditions related to topography, soil characteristics, and
water bodies are likely to create heterogeneity in ground thermal regime (Burn, 2005; Etzelmüller, 2013;
Fagan & Nelson, 2017; Gangodagamage et al., 2014). These effects derive from, for example, varying expo-
sure of ground surface to incoming solar radiation (controlling energy input) and soil type (affecting heat
conductance and water movement). Moreover, topography controls snow distribution, which inﬂuences
offset between atmospheric and ground temperatures (Gisnås et al., 2016; Zhang, 2005).
Here a statistical modeling approach is presented to create high-quality MAGT and ALT data layers covering
circum-Arctic domain at ﬁne spatial resolution (30 arc sec) that is unreachable with contemporary transient
ground thermal models. First, current MAGT and ALT estimates are produced using extensive borehole data
and ALT measurements, and ensemble of forecasts generated with multiple statistical techniques. Second,
the modeling framework is used to assess future MAGT and ALT forced by the change in climate conditions
as predicted by downscaled global climate simulations. Finally, a regional inspection is carried out to high-
light the magnitude of MAGT and ALT change over the circum-Arctic.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Ground Temperature Data
Standardized observations of MAGT (n = 797) from the land areas >30°N (cf. northern hemisphere domain,
NHM) were compiled mainly from the Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost (GTN-P) database
(Biskaborn et al., 2015; Figure 1 and Table S1). MAGT observations at or near the depth of zero annual ampli-
tude (ZAA, annual temperature variation <0.1°C) were used (Romanovsky et al., 2010). However, as the exact
depth of ZAA was not explicitly reported for the majority of observations in the databases, the ZAA depths
were manually determined using data in the GTN-P and additional databases available by examining the
temperature variations at various depths. A signiﬁcant portion of the boreholes without conﬁrmed depth
of ZAA was based on a single-time temperature measurement. In these cases, a value at or the closest to
15 m below the ground surface was used (Barry & Gan, 2011; Harris et al., 2009). All measurement sites inﬂu-
enced by strong disturbances (e.g., forest ﬁres and anthropogenic heat source) were omitted from the data. A
minimum location precision of two decimal degrees (<1 km within the study domain, mostly <100 m) was
adopted to ascertain that borehole locations and geospatial data match spatially.
The temporal focus was limited to a period of 2000–2014 for obtaining reasonable long-term averages with
maximum number of observation sites.

2.2. Active Layer Thickness Data
A total of 303 ALT observation sites were compiled from the GTN-P database (Biskaborn et al., 2015) and
additional data sets (Figure 1 and Table S2). The ALT measurements are based on either mechanical probing
in grids or transects, or single-point depth values from thaw tubes or soil temperature proﬁles (Brown et al.,
2000; Nelson et al., 2004). Grids and transects included multiple individual ALT measurements, from which a
mean value was calculated to represent ALT at the site. While acknowledging the high spatial variability
of ALT over short distances (Westermann et al., 2010), a liberal location-precision criterion of an arc
minute was used to avoid for omitting a large part of the observations. Any documented anomalous
measurement sites (postﬁre measurements and imprecise depths) were not considered to represent
undisturbed observations.
2.3. Climate Data: Current and Past Conditions
To obtain spatially detailed climate data for current conditions (2000–2014), the WorldClim (WC, version 1)
data set (Hijmans et al., 2005) with a spatial resolution of 30 arc sec was used. The WC data are representative
of period of 1950–2000, thus not coinciding the temporal frame of this study. Therefore, an adjustment
scheme was applied where external coarse scale data were used to account for changes in the climatic para-
meters between the two time periods. The adjustment was made using the Global Meteorological Forcing
Dataset for land surface modeling (GMFD, version 2; Shefﬁeld et al., 2006, spatial resolution of 0.5°). The
GMFD data were processed to represent monthly average temperature and precipitation over the time per-
iod of 2000–2014, but also for past conditions of 1970–1984 and 1985–1999 for model validation. The GMFD
data were resampled using nearest neighbor interpolation to match the spatial resolution of the WC data.

Finally, the WC data were adjusted by the amount of locally smoothed (a moving average of 3 × 3 pixels)
difference between the coarser-scale GMFD data (i.e., representing 2000–2014) and WC data.
Four predictors were calculated from the adjusted climate data: freezing and thawing degree-days (°C,
FDD and TDD, respectively; Westermann et al., 2015), and snow precipitation (i.e., precipitation sum in
millimeter for months below 0°C, PrecT ≤0°C) and water (i.e., precipitation sum for months above
0°C, PrecT > 0°C).
2.4. Climate Data: Future Conditions
Climate projections for the 21st century are based on an ensemble of 18 global climate models from the
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 archive (Taylor et al., 2012), which are included in the WC
data set (Hijmans et al., 2005). The data represent downscaled and bias-corrected monthly mean tempera-
tures and precipitation over two time periods (2041–2060 and 2061–2080) and three Representative
Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios (Moss et al., 2010; RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5, roughly corresponding
global CO2 levels of 440, 570, and 1250 ppm by the end of this century, respectively). The four climate vari-
ables (TDD, FDD, PrecT ≤0°C, and PrecT > 0°C) were recalculated for each time period and RCP scenario.
2.5. Local Environmental Predictors
The topography-derived potential incoming solar radiation (PISR, MJ · cm2 · a1) was computed using the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (U.S. Geological Survey,
2004) digital elevation model at a 30 arc sec spatial resolution following McCune & Keon (2002). To account
the effect of organic material on ground thermal regime (Harris et al., 2009), we included soil organic carbon
(SOC, g · kg1) content information from global SoilGrids1km data (Hengl et al., 2014) to our analyses. A glo-
bal Water Bodies product (version 4.0) in 150 m spatial resolution published by the European Space Agency
Climate Change Initiative (2016) allowed us to determine the percentage cover of waterbodies inside each
30 arc sec grid cell. All the data layers were resampled to the matching spatial resolution (30 arc sec) and
extent (>30°N).
2.6. Statistical Modeling
The observed MAGT and ALT were related to the climate and local environmental predictors using four sta-
tistical modeling techniques: generalized linear modeling (GLM; McCullagh & Nelder, 1989), generalized addi-
tive modeling (GAM; Hastie & Tibshirani, 1990) as implemented in R package mgcv (Wood, 2011), generalized
boosting method (GBM; Elith et al., 2008) based on R package dismo (Hijmans et al., 2016), and random forest
(Breiman, 2001), R package randomForest (RF; Liaw & Wiener, 2002). The detailed information of the model-
ing techniques, and their parameters, is provided in Text S1 (Friedman, 2002; R Core Team, 2016). To show the
effects of local environmental predictors on MAGT and ALT, the models were ﬁtted using two sets of predic-
tors: (1) climate variables (Climate only model) and (2) climate variables with topography and soil included
(Full model):
MAGT and ALT ¼ TDD þ FDD þ PrecT≤0°C þ PrecT>0°C
(1)
(Climate-only model)
MAGT ¼ TDD þ FDD þ PrecT≤0°C þ PrecT>0°C þ PISR þ SOC þ water cover
(2)
(MAGT Full model)
ALT ¼ TDD þ FDD þ PrecT≤0°C þ PrecT>0°C þ PISR þ SOC
(3)
(ALT Full model)
The water cover predictor was not considered in ALT Full models due to low amount of variation of water
cover in the data, which did not allow establishing a clear correlation between the two variables. The Full
models were consequently used to forecast MAGT and ALT across the NHM domain and three focus areas
representing different ground thermal regimes (Fennoscandia, number 1 in Figure 1; Northern continental
Canada (2); and Central Siberia (3), each 2.9 × 106 km2) in both baseline and future climates. In order to reduce
uncertainties related to the choice of modeling technique, ensembles of predictions were compiled using the
median over the four individual predictions (Gallien et al., 2012).

Predictive performance (cf. transferability) of the models was assessed with a repeated cross-validation (CV)
scheme, where the models were ﬁtted 1,000 times at each round using a random sample of 95% of the data
(with no replacement) and subsequently evaluated against the remaining 5%. Distance-block (hereafter
h-block) of 500 km was speciﬁed to omit model calibration data being located at the vicinity of the evaluation
data, which could lead to overly optimistic CV statistics due to spatial autocorrelation (Roberts et al., 2016).
The use of h-block led on average 450 (out of 757 from the initial data split) observation available for
MAGT model calibration (150 [out of 288] for ALT) and 50 for evaluation (25 for ALT) per CV round. After each
CV run and for all modeling techniques and their ensemble median, the predicted and observed MAGT and
ALT were compared in the terms of root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean difference (cf. bias), and adjusted R-
squared (R2; Gisnås et al., 2016). Model transferability was also evaluated over past MAGT and ALT observa-
tions (cf. hindcasting, periods of 1970–1984 and 1985–1999, no h-block was speciﬁed). For ALT, comparison
for 1970–1984 was not possible due to the low number of observations available (n = 16).
The forecasts’ uncertainty in both present and future conditions were assessed using a repeated random
resampling procedure (Aalto et al., 2016), where 1,000 predictions over 100,000 randomly chosen pixels
within NHM domain were created using bootstrap sampling of the observations (Text S2; Efron &
Tibshirani, 1994; Lahiri, 2013; Selle & Hannah, 2010). Then 95% prediction intervals (PI) for each pixel over
the repeats were calculated (Figure S1). The uncertainty was summarized over two percentiles of the PI dis-
tribution; median uncertainty (PI50, used to depict uncertainty in subsequent analyses) and 95th percentile
uncertainty (PI95, indicating anomalous forecasts) across all 100,000 pixels. Note that the uncertainty mea-
sure is independent of the predictive performance measure (see Text S2).
3. Results
The Full models were signiﬁcantly more accurate in forecasting present MAGT than Climate-only models
(ensemble approach; p ≤0.001, paired one-sided t test, n = 1,000). The ensemble median over the four tech-
niques provided the highest predictive performance (Full model mean RMSE = 1.6°C, n = 1,000; Figure S2).
Similarly, the ALT models signiﬁcantly beneﬁtted from the consideration of local environmental predictors
(except for GAM) with RF showing higher predictive performance (RMSE = 89 cm) than ensemble
(RMSE = 104 cm). The hindcasting suggested good transferability of the Full MAGT models over time
(Figure 2), showing larger error in 1970–1984 (RMSE = 1.9°C, R2 = 0.90) compared to 1985–1999
(RMSE = 1.6°C, R2 = 0.93). Similarly, the modeled ALT agreed relatively well with the past observations
(RMSE = 53 cm and R2 = 0.70 for 1985–1999), indicating a reasonable transferability of the models.

layer thickness (ALT) in past conditions (cf. hindcasting, 1970–1984 and 1985–1999) based on ensemble median of four
statistical techniques (the Full model). ALT hindcasting analysis for the period of 1970–1984 was omitted due to low
number of observations (n = 16). The predictive performance was measured in terms of bias (mean difference), root-
mean-square error (RMSE), and adjusted R-squared (R2) between observed and predicted values. The dashed black line
indicates 1:1.

GLM and GAM resulted in the lowest median uncertainty (PI50 = ±0.82 and 0.83°C, respectively) associated
with the MAGT forecasts under baseline conditions (Figure 3). For ALT the most robust technique was
GBM (PI50 = ±25 cm, baseline), while the ensemble and RF showed relatively similar uncertainty (±35 and
±37 cm, respectively). The ensemble approach notably reduced the largest deviations among the forecasts
(PI95) especially for MAGT.
Spatial forecasts highlighted substantial local variation in MAGT and ALT, and the ﬁne resolution of the ana-
lyses (Figures 4 and S3–S6). The results suggested pronounced, but region-speciﬁc, future changes in MAGT
and ALT due to climate change; the average MAGTs over the NHM were predicted to increase from 4.1 to
6.2°C by 2061–2080 (RCP2.6), and further up to 8.4°C under RCP8.5 (Figure S7 and Table S3). In the
Fennoscandia the increase in average MAGT was limited to ~4°C (from present to 2061–2080 RCP8.5, ALT
increase of 47 cm), whereas the corresponding increase in Central Siberia was found to be from 6.0 to nearly
0°C (ALT increase from 79 to 90 cm). Over the NHM, ALT was predicted to increase from 102 (2000–2014) to
118 cm (2061–2080 RCP8.5).
4. Discussion

niques to produce high-resolution spatial forecasts of current and future MAGT and ALT. The reliability of the

forecasts was supported by the relatively low uncertainty and hindcasting that showed good transferability
of the MAGT models. The uncertainty of the models was only slightly affected by the change in climate
parameters, indicating that the model calibration data were representative of the climatological gradients
controlling MAGT and ALT. For MAGT the beneﬁts of using the ensemble modeling approach were
evident; the median of the four techniques resulted in both the highest cross-validation statistics and the
lowest 95th percentile uncertainty (Marmion et al., 2009). For ALT the cross-validation errors remained
high across the modeling techniques, suggesting that the approach used was capable of detecting only
general ALT trends. The low number of observation made ALT model calibration highly sensitive to single
observations (Hjort & Marmion, 2008), causing a wide spread in forecasts’ uncertainty among the
techniques. Thus, the analyses suggest that when extrapolating to future climate conditions, the use of an
ensemble framework does not necessarily produce the most robust predictions. Here for ALT, the GBM
appears to provide a good balance between model complexity and parsimony (low errors and
uncertainty). Similarly, the parametric GLM reduces the risk of overﬁtting (and thus the most spurious
forecasts) providing relatively low 95th percentile uncertainty, but with a cost of modeling accuracy
(Heikkinen et al., 2012). Interestingly, for both MAGT and ALT, the uncertainty was greatly reduced after
considering areas >60°N (Figure S8) where most permafrost in the northern hemisphere occurs.
The modeling links MAGT and ALT mainly to the prevailing climate conditions, indicated by the relatively low
increase in model transferability after accounting for local environmental predictors. This suggests that cli-
matic factors determine the main spatial trends in ground thermal regimes (Gangodagamage et al., 2014;
Gruber, 2012). Coarser-scale MAGT and ALT patterns were locally mediated by topography, soil characteris-
tics, and water covers reﬂecting, for example, soil microclimatic effects driven by differences in incoming
solar radiation and land surface thermal-hydrological conditions (Etzelmüller, 2013; Nelson et al., 1997).
Predictors that could locally improve the forecasts, but were not considered here, are vegetation (Nelson
et al., 1997; Shur & Jorgenson, 2007) and anthropogenic land use, which can alter the energy exchange
between ground and atmosphere (Jorgenson et al., 2010). These factors were excluded from the analyses
due to their presumably spatio-temporally dynamic nature that hinders the ability to develop future land

cover scenarios. Soil texture and grain size information were not considered in the models due to the missing
data, which would have caused the model domain to notably contract.
The forecasts indicate potential for substantial near- and long-term alterations in MAGT and ALT over the
northern hemisphere domain due to climate change. Based on the MAGT forecast, currently suitable condi-
tions for permafrost occurrence prevail over an area of 15.1 ± 2.8 × 106 km2 (± uncertainty; Figures 4 and S9),
which closely corresponds to recent modeling estimates (Chadburn et al., 2017; Guo & Wang, 2016; McGuire
et al., 2016). This extent was predicted to dramatically shrink; under RCP8.5, the corresponding extents were
8.0 × 106 km2 (6.0–10.0 × 106 km2) by 2041–2060 and 5.4 × 106 km2 (3.5–7.4 × 106 km2) by 2061–2080. The
regional response of ground thermal regime to climate change is controlled by differences in atmospheric
warming (generally increasing poleward; Chadburn et al., 2017), and the current ground thermal state
(Guo & Wang, 2016). The results suggest that areas currently associated with high predicted climate warming
and low MAGT (e.g., Central Siberia) can experience the relatively highest MAGT increase over the three focus
areas. Similarly, the increase in ALT is likely to be pronounced at regions currently underlain by discontinuous
or sporadic permafrost (here Fennoscandia). A large amount of uncertainty is embedded in the forecasts,
including equilibrium assumption in statistical modeling, the location accuracy of ALT measurements (repre-
sentative of a very small area) further to gridded climate data, and general circulation model outputs regard-
ing future precipitation state and amount, although main climatic trends of circum-Arctic are well established
(Bintanja & Andry, 2017; IPCC, 2013).
The presented modeling and uncertainty analyses call for further development of ground thermal monitor-
ing network over the circum-Arctic for sharpening the picture of local MAGT and ALT variations (Brown et al.,
2000; Fagan & Nelson, 2017). Large uncertainties in the ALT forecasts indicate that at present, the ALT obser-
vation network is insufﬁcient for characterizing active layer dynamics at hemisphere scale. Similar spatial
uncertainty measure to that presented here could be used as a starting point to identify critical locations
for new boreholes and ALT observatories (Figure S10). This is important since the Arctic is in the center of
environmental change and economic activities, and new infrastructure are being planned to areas that are
likely to undergo drastic changes, for example, in ground bearing capacity due to permafrost thaw (Melvin
et al., 2017). Therefore, the created data sets serve as a valuable source of information to support future
Earth system science, and sustainable development of circum-Arctic region.
5. Conclusions
Here a statistical approach was presented to forecast circum-Arctic ground temperature and ALT in relation
to climate and local environmental factors at unprecedented ﬁne spatial scale. The used cross-validation ana-
lyses suggested an excellent and reasonable transferability of the MAGT and ALT models, respectively. The
results display both theoretical and applied advancements in increasing the understanding of circum-
Arctic ground thermal modeling; ﬁrst, the capability of statistical modeling framework was conﬁrmed for
characterizing ground thermal conditions over large geographical domains. Second, the results indicate sub-
stantial, but region-speciﬁc, changes in MAGT and ALT due to climate change. These predicted changes in
ground thermal state will have inevitable consequences on multiple aspects of land surface dynamics
through alterations in permafrost, surface hydrology, and vegetation.
