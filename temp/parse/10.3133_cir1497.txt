Regional Director’s Message
Dear Stakeholders and Partners:
2021 has been another year marked by both profound challenges 
and incredible opportunities. We have transitioned to a new 
Administration with newly defined research priorities and bud­
get projections, while maintaining our established expertise and 
enriching our strong network of research partners. We have lived 
through another year of COVID-19 resurgence with ongoing disruptions 
to our workplace routines and fieldwork activities, calmly adjusting to 
updated guidance and fulfilling the duties of our mission. As I think about select highlights of 
partnership and collaboration over the past year, I reflect with great admiration and pride upon 
the resilience, hard work, and dedication of all U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) staff who contrib­
ute to our work in Alaska.
We found creative ways to respond to new challenges. Despite most of the staff still tele­
working and spending far less time traveling or in the field, our three Alaska Region Science 
Centers—the Alaska Science Center, the Volcano Science Center, and the Alaska Climate 
Adaptation Science Center (AK CASC)—maintained high productivity in terms of data releases 
and publications. During fiscal year 2021, the Alaska Science Center delivered 75 data releases 
through its data repository. In addition, the Alaska Science Center delivered over 185 peer-
reviewed publications including USGS Series and manuscripts published through external 
journals, books, and monographs. The Volcano Science Center delivered over 195. The AK CASC 
delivered over fifty peer-reviewed publications in fiscal year (FY) 2021, as well as a variety of 
data sets, public-outreach materials, and other informational products.
A key highlight of FY2021 was the USGS Landslide Program and Alaska Regional Office coor­
dinated an intergovernmental response to the discovery of a potential landslide into the Barry 
Arm of Prince William Sound that threatens the town of Whittier and regional mariners with 
tsunamis. The USGS quickly pivoted resources and staff to address public concern with this new 
threat through a partnership involving the State, the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administra­
tion, the University of Alaska, and the Alaska Volcano Observatory. USGS led the effort to deploy 
instrumentation to monitor the landslide area for signs of instability and characterize the nature 
of the threat. Using more detailed bathymetric surveys of the area and improved tsunami model­
ing, USGS demonstrated that the maximum wave height resulting from a landslide into Barry 
Arm was less than previously described in an initial report; thus lowering (though not limiting) 
the risk to Whittier.
Another FY2021 highlight is the expanding partnership between the USGS Mineral Resources 
Program, through its Earth Mapping Resources Initiative, with the State of Alaska’s Division 
of Geological and Geophysical Surveys to acquire geoscientific data in the Yukon-Tanana (YT) 
Uplands in east-central Alaska. Airborne geophysical surveys over the YT Uplands are nearing 
completion with the first data expected to be publicly available in early FY2022. Meanwhile, 
the USGS Energy Program continues its research into the geology of Alaska’s North Slope. This 
work is vital for better quantifying and discerning oil and natural gas resources that could help 
advance a pathway toward lower-carbon energy production.
iv­­­­­­
Mapping has also been a consistent highlight, as the Alaska Mapping Executive Committee 
(AMEC) celebrated the completed collection of elevation data covering the entire state of Alaska 
as a priority focus of the nation’s Three-Dimensional Elevation Program. Since 2010, multiple 
federal agencies and the State of Alaska contributed over $68 million to complete the project. 
All the data are now fully processed and can be available through USGS and State of Alaska 
public websites. The new elevation data have been used to create a new statewide series of 
accurate digital topographic maps for Alaska. The final 75 of the 11,278 maps, that are required 
to achieve statewide coverage of Alaska, are currently in production and are expected to be 
completed before the end of FY2021. AMEC established a Coastal Mapping Subcommittee to 
prioritize and advance a statewide coastal-topography and nearshore bathymetric-mapping 
program. This program will be critical as new shipping lanes open and ocean transfer of people 
and goods expands commerce in regional, state, and federal waters.
Another highlight of collaboration was the consensual production of the next 5-year Arctic 
Research Plan, 2022–26, due to be published by the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Com-
mittee (IARPC) before year’s end. Many USGS personnel played key roles to help achieve this 
successful outcome so that Acting Director Applegate, as the Department of the Interior (DOI) 
Principal to IARPC, could ratify the new plan on behalf of all DOI bureaus. The new plan facili-
tates more comprehensive coverage of relevant DOI Arctic research, such as land conservation, 
protecting biodiversity, public health and safety, and economic vitality. Looking forward, the 
USGS remains committed to maintain a leadership role in Arctic science and technology by 
delivering accurate study of relevant resources or hazards, and by promoting integration of these 
activities through an increasingly holistic and service-oriented approach.
A final highlight of collaboration centers upon our ongoing work to ensure inclusive and equita-
ble workforce strategies to increase participation in science for underrepresented groups living 
in Alaska and the Arctic. For example, I am happy to report the Unlearning Racism in the Geosci-
ences pod in the Volcano Science Center developed a 2-year Action Plan and the regional office 
chartered the Alaska Region Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Access Steering Committee to see 
this work through to completion. The committee is currently undertaking work in the following 
areas: removing barriers in recruitment and hiring processes, establishing an accessible mentor-
ing program, mainstreaming inclusive habits and behaviors in the workplace, improving field and 
lab plans to include safety protocols related to anti-harassment, and promoting access to educa-
tional/awareness materials regarding racism. In July 2021, the Alaska Region established a new 
Memorandum of Understanding between USGS and Alaska Pacific University (APU) for a period 
of five years to support APU as an Alaska Native Serving Institution. We continue to participate 
annually in the Alaska Native Science and Engineering Program to support systematic change in 
the hiring patterns of Alaska Natives in science and engineering by placing students on a career 
path to leadership.
The public has come to expect a deeper engagement with scientists and science agencies; 
co-production is the new collaborative model of research that includes stakeholders, the public, 
donors, and policy makers. This Biennial Report is one means of providing more transparent and 
straightforward information about our diverse work as a deliberate step to facilitate external co-
production processes. I am pleased to share this Biennial Report, on behalf of the USGS Alaska 
Region and U.S. Department of the Interior Region 11.

U.S. Geological Survey—Department of the Interior 
Region 11, Alaska—2021–22 Biennial Science Report
Edited by Elizabeth M. Powers and Dee M. Williams
Alaska Organizational Overview
U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Mission: The USGS 
national mission is to monitor, analyze, and predict the current 
and evolving dynamics of complex human and natural Earth-
system interactions, and to deliver actionable information at 
scales and timeframes relevant to decision-makers. Consistent 
with the national mission, the USGS in Alaska provides timely 
and objective scientific information to help address issues 
and inform management decisions across five inter-connected 
themes:
•	 Energy and Minerals;
•	 Geospatial Mapping;
•	 Natural Hazards;
•	 Water Quality, Streamflow, and Ice Dynamics; and
•	 Ecosystems.
The USGS in Alaska consists of approximately 350 sci­
entists and support staff working in three Alaska-based science 
centers, a Cooperative Research Unit, and USGS centers out­
side Alaska, with a combined annual science budget of about 
$60 million. In the last 5 years, USGS research in Alaska has 
produced many scientific benefits resulting from more than 
1,050 publications. Publications relevant to Alaska can be 
conveniently searched by keyword through the USGS Publica­
tions Warehouse at https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/search?q=Alaska.
Regional Office
The Office of the Alaska Regional Director provides 
strategic leadership for the region’s science programs while 
facilitating growth of USGS science capacity centering on 
Arctic and Subarctic systems. The office maintains relations 
with other Federal and State agencies, Tribes, Alaska Native 
organizations, and the academic community to advance the 
goals and objectives of the U.S. Department of the Interior 
(DOI) and the White House Administration, representing a 
single interface point for the entire breadth of USGS sci­
ence and its capabilities. The regional office works in close 
coordination with local Science Centers to gather, synthesize, 
and deliver scientific information that is timely, relevant, and 
impartial concerning Alaska’s geology, geography, hydrology, 
diverse physical and biological resources, and natural hazards.
The Alaska Regional Office maintains a distinctive 
organizational and operational status in the USGS by virtue of 
several key factors:
1.	
Alaska’s size, extensive coastline, geographic separation,
Arctic and circumpolar nexus, and complex tectonic
history and dynamism bestow it a unique geology and
geography and hazard exposure compared to the rest of
the Nation;
2.	
The Federal government manages about 65 percent of
Alaska as public lands, including numerous national
forests, national parks, and national wildlife refuges;
3.	
Alaska Native subsistence activities and legal protec­
tions shape the planning and conduct of scientific
research throughout the State;
4.	
The USGS Alaska Science Center (ASC) currently oper­
ates one of the largest and most scientifically integrated
centers in the USGS, and a large volume of Alaskan and
Arctic research activities are accomplished by staff from
centers outside the State; and
5.	
The regional office, by virtue of its hosting of the Vol­
cano Science Center with its 5 volcano observatories
and responsibilities in the American west, Hawaii, and
Pacific territories, maintains awareness and partnerships
well beyond Alaska borders.
6.	
For these reasons, Alaska constitutes a dynamic area for
USGS activities.
The Alaska Regional Office provides management and
strategic coordination with the ASC, the Volcano Science 
Center (VSC), the Alaska Climate Adaptation Science Center 
(AK CASC), USGS scientists from other regions, and exter­
nal partners operating in Alaska. Current Alaska Regional 
personnel include the Regional Director (Aimee Devaris), 
Deputy Regional Director of Science (Dr. Dee Williams), 
Deputy Regional Director of Operations (Durelle Smith), 
Senior Science Advisor (Thomas Murray), Science Coordina­
tor (Dr. Elizabeth Powers), Safety Manager (Daniel Morgan), 
and Budget Analyst (Marnelli Cordero). More information 
about the Alaska Region is available at https://www.usgs.gov/
unified-interior-regions/region-11.
2    U.S. Geological Survey—Department of the Interior Region 11, Alaska—2021–22 Biennial Science Report
Alaska Science Center
The ASC, led by Dr. Christian Zimmerman, is composed 
of about 150 science and support personnel representing the 
full suite of disciplines at USGS. Research and activities in 
support of all the USGS Mission Areas are managed collec­
tively with a vision to achieve an integrated landscape-level 
understanding of the highly diverse and complex ecosystems 
of Alaska. The ASC delivered more than 270 science informa­
tion products in Fiscal Year (FY) 2021, including 95 journal 
articles, 11 USGS series reports, 76 abstracts, 9 book chapters, 
78 data releases, and 1 software release. More information 
about specific research initiatives in Alaska is available in this 
volume and on the ASC web portal at https://www.usgs.gov/
centers/asc.
Volcano Science Center
The VSC, led by Tina Neal, is under the Alaska Region, 
and manages the five U.S. regionally based volcano observa­
tories and about 175 employees on the West Coast, in Wash­
ington DC, Reston, VA, and in Hawaii. The VSC encompasses 
the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) in Anchorage and the 
observatories outside the Alaska Region; Cascades Volcano 
Observatory (CVO), Yellowstone Volcano Observatory in 
Vancouver, WA, Hawaiian Volcano Observatory in Hilo, HI, 
and California Volcano Observatory in Menlo Park and Santa 
Clara, CA; as well as the internationally scoped Volcano 
Disaster Assistance Program, a joint USGS-U.S. Agency for 
International Development program, based at CVO. Their 
common mission is to enhance public safety and minimize 
social and economic disruption from eruptions through 
delivery of effective forecasts, warnings, and information on 
volcano hazards based on scientific understanding of volcanic 
processes. VSC scientists are highly engaged with the public 
through social media, official web sites, and frequent outreach 
appearances to schools, interagency partners, and other stake­
holders. Follow news from the AVO (which is a 31-year-old 
cooperative program of USGS, the State of Alaska Department 
of Geological and Geophysical Surveys, and the University of 
Alaska Geophysical Institute) at https://www.avo.alaska.edu/.
Alaska Climate Adaptation Science Center
The AK CASC, led by Dr. Stephen Gray, is one of eight 
regional centers that provide managers with the tools and 
information they need to develop and execute management 
strategies that address the impacts of the climate on natural 
and cultural resources. The Center is hosted by the Univer­
sity of Alaska Fairbanks but is physically housed within the 
USGS campus at Alaska Pacific University in Anchorage. 
Various program partners provide expertise in climate science, 
ecology, environmental impact assessments, modeling, and 
advanced information technology. Despite limitations related 
to COVID-19, the AK CASC made significant strides to 
connect climate adaptation research with communities, man­
agers, and partners in 2021. The launch of the Alaska Tribal 
Resilience Learning Network in January brought together 
climate researchers, traditional knowledge experts, and tribal 
resilience staff to create a community of learning, sharing, 
technical assistance, training, and support for Alaska Tribes as 
they respond and adapt to the current and future impacts of cli­
mate change. The AK CASC continues to collaborate with the 
Pacific Islands Climate Adaptation Science Center in Hawaii 
to promote joint research in “Icefield to Ocean” and “Ridge 
to Reef” systems, while providing opportunities for under­
graduate and graduate student exchange. The AK CASC, with 
about 30 staff, yielded over 50 peer-reviewed publications 
in FY2021, as well as a variety of data sets, public-outreach 
materials, and other informational products. More information 
is available at https://akcasc.org.
External Partners
To meet the Nation’s most pressing science needs and 
to deliver timely and relevant information, USGS scientists 
routinely work with other Federal, State, and local government 
agencies; Tribal nations; academic institutions; international 
colleagues, and nongovernmental and private organizations. 
For the purposes of this report, we define a partner as any 
entity that actively works with USGS to co-fund or co-produce 
scientific research or natural hazard messaging activities. 
External partners include more than 20 Federal agencies, 25 
State agencies, 5 Alaska Native Organizations, 20 non-gov­
ernmental organizations, 10 industry partners, and more than 
50 academic institutions. USGS Regional Managers collabo­
rate actively with Department of the Interior (DOI) Alaska 
Bureaus and State and regional groups, especially through the 
Alaska Cooperative Planning Group, the Interagency Arctic 
Research Policy Committee, Arctic Council Working Groups, 
and numerous bilateral interagency agreements with the DOI 
bureaus of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), National 
Park Service (NPS), Bureau of Ocean Energy Management 
(BOEM), and Bureau of Land Management (BLM).
One formal partnership worth an explicit mention is the 
Alaska Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit hosted at 
the University of Alaska Fairbanks campus. This unit is part 
of a nationwide program to foster college-level research and 
graduate student training in support of science-based manage­
ment of fish and wildlife and their habitats. The Alaska Unit 
exists by cooperative agreement among the USGS, Alaska 
Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G), University of 
Alaska Fairbanks, FWS, and the Wildlife Management Insti­
tute. The unit mission is aimed at understanding the ecology 
of Alaska fish and wildlife, evaluating impacts of land use and 
development on these resources, and relating effects of social 
and economic needs to production and harvest of natural pop­
ulations. The Alaska Unit is led by Dr. Jeffrey Falke, Assistant 
Professor of Fisheries, and the Alaska Unit website address is 
https://www.akcfwru.uaf.edu/.
Structure of Report  
3­­­­
Structure of Report
The research presented in this biennial report is orga-
nized primarily by the five major topical areas (energy and 
minerals; geospatial mapping; natural hazards; water quality, 
streamflow, and ice dynamics; and ecosystems). The topical 
areas are then subdivided into relevant subsections. However, 
each project description could be sorted into other categories 
of reader interest, such as geographic location, or association 
with established DOI research priorities. To facilitate this type 
of search and discovery, this report uses various icons, which 
are embedded immediately below the title of each project 
description. Different icons are used to represent the five dif-
ferent categories of topics, four different geographic locations, 
and five different established DOI priorities. All 17 icons are 
illustrated in a legend at the conclusion of this section.
This report uses broad ecoregions as a convenient means 
to establish categories of geographic location. An ecoregion 
is an ecologically and geographically defined area that covers 
large areas of land or water and contains distinct assemblages 
of natural communities and species. Within each ecoregion, 
there exists substantial, but not absolute spatial correlation 
among the characteristic assemblages. The three broad Alaska 
ecoregions include (1) Arctic, (2) Boreal Forest, and (3) Sub-
arctic Coastal (Maritime). A fourth icon is used to represent 
work that generally spans across the entire State of Alaska.
Arctic Ecoregion (Including Bering Tundra)
The Arctic ecoregion of Alaska encompasses the area 
north of the Arctic Circle and consists of the flat and treeless 
coastal plains and the rolling foothills and rugged peaks of the 
Brooks Range. The Arctic Research Policy Act of 1984 (Pub-
lic Law 98-373, amended as Public Law 101-609) expands 
the definition to include “the territory north and west of the 
Porcupine, Yukon, and Kuskokwim Rivers (including North 
Slope and Northwest hydrologic zones), and all contiguous 
seas (including the Bering, Beaufort, Chukchi, and Arctic 
Seas).” The climate of the ecoregion primarily is cold and dry, 
where freezing temperatures dominate most of the year. The 
Arctic Ecoregion also includes the Bristol Bay region, Bering 
Sea islands, and parts of the Seward Peninsula and Yukon-
Kuskokwim Delta. The climate in the Arctic is transitional 
between maritime and continental in the Bristol Bay area and 
shifts to a moist polar climate to the north.
Boreal Forest Ecoregion
The Boreal Forest ecoregion encompasses interior 
Alaska, stretching from the southern side of the Brooks Range 
in the north and to the Alaska Range in the south. This region 
covers a wide geographic area and thus has considerable 
variation in temperature and precipitation, yet the climate is 
considered continental with short, warm summers, and long, 
cold winters.
Subarctic Coastal Ecoregion
This is the most diverse ecoregion in Alaska, consisting 
of subarctic coastal regions stretching from Southeast Alaska 
to the tip of the Aleutian Island chain. Variable landscapes 
include fjords, beaches, rocky intertidal zones, kelp forests, 
underwater seamounts, and seafloor sediment. Southeast 
Alaska is characterized by its maritime climate, temperate 
rainforests, abundant islands, and long fjords. The Aleutian 
Islands are a chain of volcanic islands covered in rugged 
mountain peaks with carved fjords, high cliffs, rocky and 
wave-battered beaches, and small dune fields. This part of the 
region has a cool maritime climate but varies greatly in terms 
of precipitation amounts, although high winds and intense 
ocean storms are common across the region.
U.S. Department of the Interior Priorities
This report links USGS program/project descriptions 
with established DOI priorities and goals. The DOI plays a 
central role in how the United States stewards its public lands, 
increases environmental protections, pursues environmental 
justice, and honors our nation-to-nation relationship with 
Tribes. In 2021, DOI identified the following thematic priori­
ties that intersect most closely with USGS activities in Alaska:
•	 Climate Science Research,
•	 Clean Energy,
•	 Public Health and Safety,
•	 Economic Vitality,
•	 Conserving Public Lands and Waters,
•	 Protecting Biodiversity,
•	 Centering Equity and Environmental Justice, and
•	 Strengthening Tribal Relations.
These DOI priorities are illustrated by the distinct icons
that appear in the legend in the following section.

Heather Johnson has been working as a Research Wildlife 
Biologist at the USGS Alaska Science Center since 2017. She 
is a terrestrial, large mammal ecologist who investigates the 
influence of changing habitat conditions on animal behavior 
and population dynamics to address the management needs 
of government agencies. Her research program focuses on 
understanding the influence of climate change and energy 
development on the behaviors, distributions, and demogra­
phy of migratory caribou in the Arctic. In collaboration with 
state, federal and international partners, Heather’s research 
determined that Arctic caribou strongly select for high-quality 
forage during the early summer, particularly forage protein, 
which is only available at the beginning of the growing 
season. Because the spatial distribution of high-quality, early 
summer forage varies each year based on the timing of snow­
melt and vegetation growth, the location of caribou summer 
ranges can exhibit dramatic annual shifts and were predicted 
to move in response to warming climate conditions. Predict­
ing such range shifts is important for identifying habitat areas 
likely to be used by caribou in the future, particularly given 
interest in expanding energy development in the Arctic.

Cyrus Read is a USGS Geophysicist for the Alaska Vol­
cano Observatory (AVO). He has worked for the AVO since 
2004, first as a contractor, then as a USGS employee. His work 
at AVO involves building, installing and maintaining volcano 
monitoring systems in Alaska and in the Commonwealth of 
the Northern Mariana Islands. The systems collect data from a 
variety of instruments including seismic, geodetic, infrasonic 
and cameras, which are telemetered via terrestrial and satellite 
networks in real time. The logistics of powering and operating 
the equipment in difficult environments, combined with boat 
and helicopter access in remote and occassionally volcanically 
active locations, provide varied and challenging work. In the 
last couple years, Cyrus has been working with the Geophysi­
cal field team at AVO to implement larger scale communica­
tion sites powered by wind and solar systems that have been 
able to maintain operation through the Alaskan winter weather. 
Information generated from these monitoring systems is used 
to monitor and forecast eruptions and issue warnings of vol­
cano hazards.

Hannah Dietterich is a USGS Research Geophysicist 
at the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO). Hannah joined 
the AVO staff in 2018 after three years as a postdoctoral 
researcher at the USGS California Volcano Observatory in 
Menlo Park. Her work focuses on lava flow dynamics, remote 
sensing of volcanic activity, numerical modeling of volcanic 
hazards, and probabilistic volcanic hazard assessment. Her 
research integrates geologic mapping, physical volcanology, 
remote sensing, and modeling with observations of ongoing 
eruptions to better understand volcanic hazards. This research 
has developed new tools for volcanic eruption monitoring 
and response in Alaska, where frequent and distant eruptions 
require remote sensing characterization of activity. Hannah’s 
work on lava flow dynamics, remote sensing, and hazard mod­
eling informed monitoring and hazard assessment during the 
2018 Kīlauea eruption crisis in Hawaii. Data collected in 2018 
by Hannah and colleagues have increased our understanding 
of lava flow physics and hazards.

Karyn Rode has been a Research Wildlife Biologist at 
the Alaska Science Center since 2012. She has been study­
ing the ecology and behavior of bears as a biologist with 
the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, the US Fish and 
Wildlife Service, several universities, and the USGS since 
1997, and she has studied other large mammals in Africa and 
Alaska. As a USGS Research Wildlife Biologist, she focuses 
on understanding the response of polar bears and walrus to 
sea ice loss and ecosystem change associated with a rapidly 
warming Arctic in order to mitigate interactions between these 
species and humans. Studying these marine mammals has 
become increasingly difficult because the rapid loss of sea ice 
in Coastal Alaska limits access to handle and take the physical 
measurements needed to track individual health and popula­
tion vitality rates. To address this problem, she undertook a 
study to identify ecological and environmental metrics that 
can serve as indicators of reproduction and cub survival in 
polar bears that live in the Chukchi Sea, publishing her results 
this year. With collaborators, she is currently publishing a 
study that will provide the first ever estimates of the energetic 
costs of walrus swimming, which will aid in determining the 
impacts of increased travel to foraging sites associated with 
recent sea ice loss.

Jeremy Littell has been a Research Ecologist with the 
Alaska Climate Adaptation Science Center for 9 years. Prior 
to that, he worked as a graduate student, postdoc, and then 
research scientist for 10 years at the University of Washington. 
His research background is in climate impacts on mountain 
and forest ecosystems, including climatic limitations on wild­
fire, tree growth, and tree establishment, as well as paleocli­
mate and paleoecological reconstruction. Recently, Jeremy has 
been studying hydroclimatic variability in the western U.S. 
over the last millennium through tree-ring chronologies that 
are uniquely sensitive to snowpack because snow limits their 
growth, and this has helped to reconstruct streamflow in snow 
dominated river systems and to understand recent snow­
droughts in a longer climate context. Jeremy has over 15 years 
of experience translating climate impacts science for use in a 
wide range of resource management, climate adaptation, and 
vulnerability assessment initiatives. He has tailored climate 
projections for land management units in Alaska, which 
includes custom climate projections of future changes in 
climate, fire, and vegetation for all the National Park Service, 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and U.S. Forest Service units 
in Alaska and, in partnership with Alaska Native Tribal Health 
Consortium and the Alaska Tribal Climate Science Liaison, 
several regions important to Alaska Native communities.

Gas Hydrate Resource Characterization
Gas hydrates are naturally gathering crystalline solids that 
form from water and gas in permafrost regions and in marine 
sediments. Gas hydrates contain large amounts of methane and 
may represent an important future source of energy; however, 
much remains to be learned about their prevalence in nature. 
Gas hydrates are known to exist in numerous sedimentary 
basins in Arctic permafrost settings and in marine sediments 
of outer continental margins. Short term production tests in 
northern Canada and Alaska have demonstrated that natural 
gas can be produced from hydrates. The USGS; U.S. Depart­
ment of Energy; and the Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National 
Corporation are leading an extended gas hydrate production 
test in the Alaska North Slope. The primary goal of this project 
is to complete a scientific field production test of gas hydrate-
bearing reservoirs using conventional production technology. 
The project included the drilling of a stratigraphic test well 
(completed in December 2018); this will be followed in 2022 
by the drilling of a geologic data well and two production test 
wells, and then the testing of the reservoir response to pressure 
reduction over a period of about 12 months.

Mineral Resources
Maintenance of Alaska Geologic Map and Mineral Deposit Databases
The USGS collects data on the geology 
and mineral resources in Alaska and maintains 
this information in the Alaska Geologic Map 
and Mineral Deposit Databases. The USGS 
tracks and updates the (1) Alaska Geologic 
Map and (2) Alaska Resource Data File 
(ARDF).
1.	
Alaska Geologic Map
The Alaska geologic mapping project 
entails the maintenance and updating of the 
Alaska geologic map database created in 
2015, incorporating newly available data and 
releasing these new data in episodic updates. 
The 2015 compilation involved creating text 
and spatial databases of available informa­
tion and data. The dataset was then integrated 
statewide to produce, in addition to the new State map, several other derivative maps. As a digital database, it is a valuable 
analytical tool that can continually be updated. The project also involves integrating the Alaska data with datasets covering parts 
of Canada, Russia, and the conterminous United States. Mineral and energy resource assessments drive demand for the geo­
logic map, but the map (and associated spatial and attribute datasets behind it) have tremendous potential for use in addressing 
regional environmental issues.
2.	
ARDF
The ARDF is a mission-critical database of mines, prospects, and mineral occurrences in the State of Alaska that is continu­
ally updated as new information becomes available. The project entails (1) providing complete, up-to-date, and user-friendly and 
user-accessible information on metallic and selected non-metallic mineral occurrences in Alaska; (2) tracking mineral industry 
activity in the State; and (3) systematically releasing updated records on the Internet. The information collected and maintained 
by the project is valuable for mineral resource assessments, mineral deposit modeling, and mineral environmental studies, as 
well as land-use decisions.

Geographic Information System Prospectivity Analysis for Critical Minerals in Ore-Forming Systems in Alaska
Energy and Minerals    13
The primary objective of the Geographic Information Sys­
tem Prospectivity Analysis for Critical Minerals in Ore-Forming 
Systems in Alaska project is to quantify and understand the 
distribution of critical elements—elements needed for techno­
logical, economic, and military applications—in ore-forming 
systems in Alaska. This is accomplished using data-driven 
geographic information system (GIS)-based methods that sys­
tematically and simultaneously analyze geospatially referenced 
datasets and provide an unbiased, quantitative product for large 
areas that are characterized by diverse types of geological, 
geochemical, and geophysical data. Our products are high-
resolution prospectivity analyses and maps for critical elements 
at the scale of about 100-square-kilometer (62-square-mile) 
drainage basins. Project objectives include (1) providing state­
wide mineral prospectivity maps for specified critical minerals, 
(2) identifying new areas in Alaska that have resource potential 
for specified minerals, (3) identifying understudied areas that 
warrant further investigation for these minerals, (4) identifying areas where data coverage is insufficient and requires future sam­
pling, (5) acquiring new data for areas for which data coverage is poor, (6) augmenting datasets, and (7) acquiring or construct­
ing new appropriate datasets. Current investigations address tungsten in granite, skarns, and orogenic gold deposits; cobalt and 
germanium in sediment-hosted base metal deposits; rhenium and platinum group elements in porphyry systems; and graphite in 
metamorphic and igneous hydrothermal systems.

Improving Understanding of Critical Mineral Potential in The Alaska Outer Continental Shelf
The United States relies on certain mineral commodities, 
known as critical minerals, that are essential to the economic 
and national security of the U.S. Under Executive Order 
13817, the Federal government is mandated to identify new 
sources of critical minerals and improve the topographic, 
geologic, and geophysical mapping to support exploration 
of critical minerals. USGS seeks to improve knowledge of 
critical mineral potential in the United States. The objectives 
of this study to improve our understanding of critical mineral 
potential in the Alaska Outer Continental Shelf are to knowl­
edge of marine minerals, including critical marine minerals 
in the Alaska Outer Continental Shelf, Exclusive Economic 
Zone, which has been found to contain several types of marine 
minerals and several others meet prospective criteria for min­
ing opportunities. Methods include data synthesis and update 
of prospective criteria for mineral resource extraction relevant

Petrogenesis and Mineralization of the Darby and Kachauik Plutons, Seward Peninsula
The Darby and Kachauik plutons on the southeastern 
Seward Peninsula AK have alkaline compositions with unusu­
ally high potassium contents and unevaluated high concen­
trations of rare earth elements (REE) and high field strength 
elements (HFSE), such as cerium and lanthanum, which are 
critically important to modern technology. Our objectives are to 
investigate the petrogenesis of the alkaline plutons, the sources, 
mechanisms of transport and concentration of the REE and 
HFSE, and the tectonic setting in which of these plutons formed. 
Methods of investigation include mapping rock types and field 
relations and collecting samples for determination of mineral 
compositions and paragenesis and for geochemical, geochro­
nologic, and isotopic analysis. These plutons are part of the 
Hogatza magmatic belt, which extends for 500 kilometers 
(310 miles) from St. Lawrence Island to the southern Brooks 
Range. Resolution of the parameters that controlled the mag­
matic sources, evolution, mineralization, and emplacement of 
the Darby and Kachauik plutons will contribute significantly to (1) understanding geologic processes that lead to concentrations 
of REE and HFSE, (2) defining criteria for evaluating the potential for concentrations of REE and HFSE in the Hogatza mag­
matic belt and elsewhere, and (3) understanding the regional tectonics of northwestern Alaska.

Tectonic and Metallogenic Evolution of the Broader Yukon-Tanana Upland
USGS Alaska Science Center research staff lead a multi-
investigator, field-based project focused on the geologic 
framework and mineral resources of the Yukon-Tanana upland 
region from Fairbanks, Alaska, southeast to the Alaska-Yukon 
border. The five-year project is funded by the USGS Mineral 
Resources Program, and significant funding was provided 
in 2020–21 by the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping 
Program to improve digital geologic map compilations. This 
project is coordinated with new geological, geophysical, and 
geochemical studies by the Alaska Division of Geological and 
Geophysical Surveys under the USGS Earth Mapping Resource 
Initiative (https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/earthmri). USGS 
research priorities include (1) new geological mapping, bedrock 
sampling, and tectonic interpretation of the regional geologic 
framework; (2) focused ore deposit and placer studies and 
regional characterization of mineralized systems; (3) studies of 
major fault networks and Cenozoic landscape evolution; and 
(4) interpretation and modeling of airborne geophysical data. 
Geologic fieldwork in 2020 and 2021 focused on a broad regional transect from Yukon-Charley National Preserve and the Good­
paster mining district in the east to the Fairbanks mining district and Manley basin to the west. The core objective of the project 
is to develop a comprehensive modern geologic, metallogenic, and geophysical framework of eastern interior Alaska.

Acquisition of Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) Data
The USGS partners with Federal, State, local, and private 
entities to collect high-quality, three-dimensional (3D) mapping 
data of the United States. The 3D Elevation Program (3DEP) 
presents a unique opportunity for collaboration between all levels 
of government and private organizations to leverage the ser­
vices and expertise of private-sector mapping firms that acquire 
3D elevation data. Federal funds to support this opportunity are 
provided by the USGS, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources 
Conservation Service. The USGS facilitates planning and acquisition for the broader community using government contracts 
and partnership agreements. All data (digital elevation models) will be made publicly available on the USGS The National Map. 
This year, the USGS and the Natural Resources Conservation Services (NCRS) are collaborating to obtain lidar elevation 
products to support conservation planning, emergency watershed planning, engineering applications, and to serve as a base layer 
for NRCS programs in the area around Delta Junction, Alaska. Clear, high accuracy digital elevation products, such as lidar and 
its derivatives, are a critical component and foundation to the NRCS mission to provide technical expertise and conservation 
planning for private landowners, conservation districts, tribes, and other organizations. The USGS is partnering with Alaska 
Electric Light and Power Company (AELP) to acquire lidar for an area of approximately 27 square kilometers (17 square miles) 
of the City and Borough Juneau. These data will support AELP and the City and Borough of Juneau in planning and landslide 
assessment. This will enable the buttressing of critical resources in the area, including the facilities and infrastructure of Bartlett 
Regional Hospital, and the Salmon Creek Reservoir and Dam.

Alaska Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (Ifsar) Elevation Data Acquisition Program
The USGS Alaska Mapping Initiative supports acquisition 
of new topographic map data and maps for Alaska. The new data 
and maps raise the accuracy of Alaska topographic mapping to 
levels common in the conterminous United States. Topographic 
maps are generated from radar technology referred to as inter­
ferometric synthetic aperture radar (IfSAR) elevation data. IfSAR 
is used to collect the data because it can penetrate clouds, smoke, 
and haze often present in Alaska. Alaska IfSAR acquisition sup­
ports the broader national 3DEP. Collection of a 5-meter resolu­
tion elevation grid for Alaska began in 2012 and was completed 
in 2020, replacing the former 60-meter statewide elevation grid. 
Multiple federal agencies and the State of Alaska contributed 
over $68M to complete the project. All the data are now fully 
processed and can be downloaded through USGS and State of 
Alaska public websites. The new elevation data have been used 
to create a new statewide series of accurate digital topographic 
maps for Alaska. The final 75 of the 11,278 maps required to 
achieve statewide coverage of Alaska are currently in production 
and are expected to be completed before the end of FY2021. New 
technologies are being investigated to collect high-resolution 
elevation data for Alaska, which will improve the accuracy of 
topographic maps in the future.

The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD), Watershed 
Boundary Dataset (WBD), and NHDPlus High Resolution 
(NHDPlus HR) are geospatial datasets that map and model 
the surface water of the United States. Together, the NHD 
and WBD form a rich data suite that maps the Nation’s 
surface-water network and hydrologic unit areas. The NHD 
at 1:24,000 scale or better represents the Nation’s hydrologic 
drainage networks and related features, including rivers, 
streams, canals, lakes, ponds, glaciers, coastlines, dams, and 
stream gauges. The WBD represents drainage areas of the 
country at eight nested levels. The NHD and WBD are the 
most up-to-date and geographically inclusive hydrography 
datasets for the Nation.

In Alaska, most of the mapping of this water is based on 1950s-era USGS historical topographic maps and is mapped at a 
broad 1:63,360-scale. Numerous partners are engaged to remap Alaska waters to meet national high-resolution, 1:24,000-scale 
standards. This work is overseen by the Alaska Geospatial Council Alaska Hydrography Technical Working Group, which has 
two goals: (1) update the NHD to national standards, and (2) meet specific hydrography mapping needs of agencies in Alaska. 
As a result of this collaborative effort, nearly 30 percent of the NHD in Alaska has been updated to the 1:24,000 scale national 
standard and the data are available to the public. NHD priority updates include data from the Cook Inlet Basin. The updates also 
include updates to the WBD. The WBD, NHD USGS digital elevation data will be used to generate NHDPlus HR for Alaska in 
the future.

Landsat 9 represents a longstanding partnership between the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration (NASA) and the USGS that continues the Landsat program’s 
critical role of repeat global observations for monitoring, understanding, and managing 
Earth’s natural resources. Since 1972, Landsat data have provided a unique resource for 
those who work in agriculture, geology, forestry, regional planning, education, mapping, 
hazards, hand global-change research. NASA is responsible for the space segment (instru­
ments and spacecraft/observatory), mission integration, launch, and on-orbit checkout. 
The USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center is responsible for 
the ground system, flight operations, data processing, and data product distribution after 
NASA completes on-orbit checkout. The Landsat 9 spacecraft and instruments success­
fully launched into orbit on September 27, 2021. Landsat 9 will image the Earth every 16 
days in an 8-day offset with Landsat 8. Landsat 9 will collect as many as 750 scenes per 
day, and with Landsat 8, the two satellites will add nearly 1,500 new scenes per day to the 
USGS Landsat archive. All Landsat 9 data products will continue to be made available 
for download through the USGS EROS Center at no charge. U.S. Landsat Analysis Ready 
Data (ARD) products are consistently processed to the highest scientific standards and 
level of conversion required for direct use in monitoring and assessing landscape change. U.S. Landsat ARD is available for the 
conterminous United States, Alaska, and Hawaii. In Alaska, USGS scientists and others use Landsat imagery to help land and 
resource managers make informed decisions about the State’s energy and mineral resources and wildlife habitats, as well as to 
contribute to a greater understanding of geologic processes, coastal erosion, and anticipated future landscape changes. Landsat 
ARD products include Landsat 4-8 collections and are available for Alaska from 1984 to present, with significant expansion in 
the number of scenes available for download in 1999, 2013, and 2020.

U.S. Arctic Research Policy Act (ARPA) Boundary Maps
The Alaska Regional Office 
worked with the National Geospa­
tial Technical Operations Center 
to develop a new series of general 
reference maps to demonstrate 
relevant features of the U.S. Arctic 
boundary as defined by Congress in 
1984. The first generation of ARPA 
boundary maps were originally 
formatted in 2009 by a private 
firm contracted with the National 
Science Foundation and the U.S. 
Arctic Research Commission (see 
https://storage.googleapis.com/
arcticgov-static/publications/maps/
ARPA_Alaska_and_Polar.pdf). 
The fundamental rationale for the 
update is the increasing relevance 
of Arctic issues to national and 
global affairs that requires more 
functional projections and online 
tools to support and maintain 
domain awareness.
The first plate depicts the 
ARPA boundary as it relates to 
Alaska and marine features of the 
Bering Sea. The second plate depicts 
the international boundary from a circumpolar perspective. The third plate depicts the national boundary of the U.S. 200 nautical 
mile Exclusive Economic Zone through the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas to facilitate more consistent territorial assess­
ments of the U.S. Arctic. The fourth plate depicts in poster size detail the boundary as it relates to terrestrial features of Arctic 
Alaska north of the Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers. The fifth plate depicts in poster size detail the boundary as it relates to 
marine and terrestrial features of the Aleutian chain.
Collectively, these new maps illustrate several value-added attributes, including (1) updated bathymetry and shoreline 
refinements, (2) demographic information, (3) international borders and offshore territorial claims, (4) Alaska conservation 
areas, (5) Alaska land cover, (6) Alaska terrestrial shaded relief, (7) annual sea ice maximum extent, (8) annual circumpolar 
10-degrees Celsius isotherm, (9) location of active volcanoes, and (10) enhanced metadata information. The static pdf file maps 
offer value as stand-alone products but are intended to be used in conjunction with a forthcoming interactive website sourced by 
annual data updates, enables users to access the various map layers in a dynamic up-to-date environment.

Natural Hazards
Earthquakes and Tsunamis
Alaska Earthquake Hazards 
The major fault systems in Alaska, including the Denali 
and Queen Charlotte-Fairweather Faults, and the Alaska-
Aleutian subduction zone, produce large earthquakes that 
threaten lives and property. Many active faults, especially 
structures along the subduction zone, can generate large 
tsunamis that will threaten Alaskan coastal communities 
and propagate across the Pacific Ocean causing widespread 
impacts. The main objectives of the Alaska Earthquake 
Hazards Project focus on more accurately defining the loca­
tion, magnitude, and frequency of prehistoric earthquakes 
and tsunamis, which inform probabilistic assessments of 
future hazards. Using methods in paleoseismology, geochro­
nology, and quantitative geomorphology, the research team 
completes field-based studies to understand how, where, and 
why earthquakes and tsunamis happen in Alaska. Expected 
outcomes include seismic and tsunami source param­
eters used to update the National Seismic Hazard Map for 
Alaska. Research results inform tsunami hazard assessments 
completed by States and Territories with support from the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) 
National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program.

Updating the USGS Ground Failure Product in Southcentral Alaska
The availability of high-quality shaking estimates for 
the Magnitude 7.1 2018 earthquake in Southcentral Alaska 
with detailed field observations about ground failure that 
happened during the 2018 earthquake and past earthquakes 
make the Alaska region an ideal study to assess the USGS 
near-real-time ground failure model performance and deter­
mine how we could make improvements to the model. The 
ground failure model estimates the probability of landslide 
and liquefaction happening as well as population exposure 
after an earthquake event. The ground failure models can 
also be used for scenarios and probabilistic hazard studies. 
Because the models are designed to be rapidly and consis­
tently applicable in any region of the world, they are simple 
and rely on globally available input datasets. However, the 
current models do not consider that for many regions of 
the U.S., we have more detailed susceptibility information. 
The main objective of the project is to improve the models 
at regional scales by creating more detailed and higher-
resolution model inputs for the Southcentral Alaska region 
and developing a new modeling framework that enables the 
incorporation of higher quality susceptibility data.

Prince William Sound Landslide Hazards
Natural Hazards    23
In Spring of 2020, a large slow-moving landslide was 
identified in Barry Arm, a recently deglaciated fjord in Prince 
William Sound, Alaska. Although this landslide is identifiable 
in imagery dating to 1957, the rapid retreat of the Barry Gla­
cier in the past decade has increased the risk of large displace­
ment waves. Prior to 2010, failure of the landslide would have 
resulted in runout on the glacier. After retreat of the glacial 
terminus, partial or catastrophic failure of the landslide has the 
potential to directly enter the ocean and generate a tsunami that 
can forcefully impact nearby communities, marine traffic, and 
infrastructure. Although the Barry Arm landslide is currently the 
most publicized instability in the region, other large, potentially 
tsunamigenic landslides exist in Prince William Sound. The 
extreme hazard and risk to onshore and offshore assets, and the 
large geographic area necessitate a thorough characterization of 
landslide hazards in the region.
The Prince William Sound landslide hazards project objec­
tives are to (1) identify potentially tsunamigenic landslides in 
Prince William Sound, (2) determine geologic and meteorologic controls on landslide movement, (3) surveil potentially hazard­
ous landslides to detect elevated rates of landslide motion that may presage failure, (4) produce coupled landslide and displace­
ment wave hazard and risk assessments in Prince William Sound, (5) provide input for early warning capabilities, and (6) 
increase situational awareness of potential hazards in the surrounding communities.

Large earthquakes and changing climate con­
ditions in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve 
(GBNPP) can trigger landslides. In coastal areas of 
GBNPP, landslide debris falling into the ocean can 
generate tsunamis, creating a potential risk to cruise 
ships, tour boats, and sea kayaks. The peak June–
August cruise ship visitor season is also the season 
when climatically induced landslides are most likely to 
happen. This timing between high numbers of visitors 
and landslide/tsunami hazard has prompted the USGS 
to address the following questions: (1) which areas 
of Glacier Bay are susceptible to rockslides or rock 
avalanches that could enter the water and potentially 
generate tsunamis, (2) what is the likelihood that 
these slides and tsunamis could happen and how large 
would they be, (3) if they happen, what would be the risk to people, boats and infrastructure, and (4) if a substantial risk to visi­
tors exists, what should be done about it? Methods used to address these questions include (1) landslide mapping using remotely 
sensed data, (2) field work and modeling to assess inherent landslide susceptibility to earthquake and climatic triggered ground 
failures, (3) landslide runout and tsunami modeling in critical areas determined to be moderately to highly susceptible to fail­
ures, and (4) a risk assessment that uses tsunami modeling. The first year of fieldwork that was initiated in the summer of 2021 
to make measurements of rock-mass quality to characterize landslide susceptibility.

Crustal Imaging of the Queen Charlotte Fault System
26    U.S. Geological Survey—Department of the Interior Region 11, Alaska—2021–22 Biennial Science Report
Often called the “San Andreas of 
the North”, the Queen Charlotte fault 
(QCF) system is a strike-slip plate 
boundary that separates the Pacific and 
North American tectonic plates off­
shore from western Canada and South­
east Alaska. The fault system caused 
Canada’s largest recorded earthquake 
(Magnitude 8.1) in 1949 and it is the 
largest seismic hazard to southeastern 
Alaska and western Canada (outside of 
Cascadia). Crustal imaging of the Queen 
Charlotte fault system is needed to char­
acterize deformation and seismic hazard 
in southeastern Alaska and western Brit­
ish Columbia. In the summer of 2021, 
an international group of researchers 
initiated a study to characterize the QCF 
plate boundary on a regional scale. The 
Transform Obliquity along the QCF and 
Earthquake Study (TOQUES) proj­
ect used seismic energy from marine 
acoustic sources and ocean-bottom 
seismometer (OBS) instruments to 
image the QCF and determine velocity and thermal structure across the fault zone. Additional OBS are scheduled to be deployed 
in 2021–22 to measure the depth and extent of seismicity in several key regions. Data and interpretations from the TOQUES 
project will improve understanding of tectonic processes along the QCF fault system, and other strike-slip fault systems, for bet­
ter hazard assessment and earthquake forecasting.

Volcanoes
Alaska Volcano Observatory
Natural Hazards    27
Map showing volcanoes of the Aleutian arc in Alaska. The Alaska Volcano Observatory uses various methods including 
real-time geophysical networks and satellite imagery to monitor activity at Alaskan volcanoes stretching from Mount 
Hayes, 141 kilometers (88 miles) from Anchorage to Kiska, 2,198 km (1,366 miles) from Anchorage. Not shown are other 
Holocene volcanoes of the Wrangell Mountains, southeast Alaska, and northwest Alaska. For more information about 
Alaska’s volcanoes, please visit https://www.avo.alaska.edu.
Alaska has 54 historically active volcanoes and about 100 volcanoes that were active in the past 11,000 years. The primary 
hazard from eruptions is airborne ash, though several communities are vulnerable to ashfall, mudflow, and pyroclastic flow 
hazards. The Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) is a joint program of the USGS, the Geophysical Institute of the University of 
Alaska Fairbanks, and the State of Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys, was formed in 1988 to (1) monitor 
and study Alaska’s hazardous volcanoes, (2) forecast and record eruptive activity, and (3) mitigate impacts of volcanic haz­
ards to life and property. AVO uses several monitoring methods including seismic stations at 32 volcanoes, continuous Global 
Positioning System stations at 8 volcanoes, regional and local infrasound sensors, and web cameras. In addition to ground-based 
monitoring, AVO relies on satellite data and other remote data streams to detect volcanic unrest and eruptions. AVO has robust 
basic and applied research programs that include topical and place-based studies using geophysics, petrology, geology, geo­
chemistry, remote sensing, and numerical modeling. AVO produces formal information products regarding volcanic activity and 
hazards (https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/vns2/); journal articles and USGS publications on volcanic processes, methods, and hazards; 
and hazards assessments and geologic maps.

Analog-to-Digital Conversion of Volcano Monitoring Sites in Alaska
28    U.S. Geological Survey—Department of the Interior Region 11, Alaska—2021–22 Biennial Science Report
Converting volcano monitoring 
networks from analog to digital (A2D) 
upgrades the remaining legacy analog 
volcano-monitoring equipment used by 
the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) 
geophysical network to enhance moni­
toring capabilities and meet regulatory 
requirements. New and updated ground-
based instrumentation includes modern 
broadband seismometers, infrasound 
sensors, and web cameras, which signifi­
cantly improve AVO’s ability to detect 
unrest, forecast eruptive activity, and 
issue timely alerts of volcano hazards. 
The upgrades replace aging analog 
equipment with modern digital instru­
ments and radios, as well as refurbish­
ment of existing digital equipment at 
some sites by constructing more robust 
digital installations. This work is required 
by the National Telecommunications and 
Information Administration to vacate radio frequencies used by older analog equipment; it has substantially improved the quality 
of AVO’s monitoring data since the major effort began 2019. The new data will be helpful to other hazard monitoring programs, 
such as those focused on earthquakes and tsunamis.
In 2019, upgrades were completed at 45 stations on networks around Adak (Gareloi, Tanaga, Kanaga, and Great Sitkin) 
and on Atka Island. In 2020, progress was slower due to COVID-19, but 13 upgrades were completed. Twenty-five field stations 
were upgraded in 2021. Volcano monitoring networks at Little Sitkin, Semisopochnoi, and Okmok have been completely con­
verted from analog to digital telemetry. Little Sitkin and Semisopochnoi are the most remote volcanoes in the Aleutians moni­
tored by AVO; these stations are among the most challenging to upgrade, thus marking a major milestone in the project. Other 
notable accomplishments on the A2D project in 2021 include the construction of a satellite communications hub at Fort Glenn, 
Umnak Island and the installation of an infrasound array at Amchitka, western Aleutians. In addition to work on the A2D proj­
ect, critical maintenance was completed at several other volcano networks including Korovin, Unimak, Makushin, and Akutan.

Sea Ice Loss, Coastal Flooding, and Erosion
Alaska Coastal Processes and Hazards
Natural Hazards    29
The current warming trend across the Arctic and Alaska 
is substantially reducing sea ice extent, causing permafrost 
thaw, and changing climatic and oceanographic patterns. 
Coastal impacts resulting from these changes are multi-dimen­
sional and include rapid coastal erosion that threatens village 
and facility (for example, oil and gas) infrastructure, ecosys­
tem stability, and critical cultural and social networks. Parallel 
to the negative impacts are emerging opportunities related 
to increasing accessibility impacting planning and economic 
development strategies. The objectives of this project are to 
identify hazards; quantify risk; and evaluate impacts of past, 
present, and future coastal processes on infrastructure, biology, 
and people along the Alaskan coast. The methods integrate 
field studies and numerical modeling and include (1) devel­
oping new methods for collection of permafrost thermal 
exchange, (2) nearshore bathymetry and elevation data, and 
(3) modeling tools for better characterizing future flood haz­
ards, bluff recession, and barrier island landscape change.

Building an Operational System to Forecast Potential Flood Hazards in Unalakleet, Alaska 
30    U.S. Geological Survey—Department of the Interior Region 11, Alaska—2021–22 Biennial Science Report
Like many coastal communities of Alaska, the village of 
Unalakleet is vulnerable to marine flooding during large storms. 
Storm surge in Norton Sound typically happens in the fall and 
winter months when the coastline is covered with shorefast ice. 
However, warming trends in the Arctic have resulted in reduced 
ice coverage and increased development of wave events affect­
ing coasts. Two video cameras were installed by the USGS in 
collaboration with the Alaska Division of Geological and Geo­
physical Surveys and village authorities to better document and 
understand wave and water-level dynamics in Norton Sound. 
Every 30 minutes during daylight hours, the cameras collect 
snapshots and videos for 10 minutes, which are posted online. 
These and other images are then used to observe and quan­
tify coastal processes such as wave run-up, development of rip 
channels, bluff erosion, and movement of sandbars and ice floes. 
The USGS plans to install similar systems in other U.S. locations 
(two video cameras temporarily overlooked the Beaufort Sea 
coast from atop the coastal bluff of Barter Island near Kaktovik in 2018). The knowledge gained from this imagery will improve 
computer-derived simulations of shoreline change that communities can use to plan for sea-level rise, changing storm patterns, 
and other threats to coasts. In collaboration with NOAA, the overriding USGS goal is to develop a real-time system to provide 
approximately 6-day forecasts of total water level and flood potentials from the analysis of astronomic tides, storm surge, and 
wave runup. Toward that end, about 90 kilometers (56 miles) of bathymetry track-line data were collected in the inlet and estu­
ary and along the open coast extending about 1.2 kilometers (0.75 miles) north and south of the inlet and about 1.5 kilometers 
(0.9 miles) offshore.

Wave and Hydrodynamic Observations and Modeling in the Nearshore Beaufort Sea
Natural Hazards    31
Renewed interest in nearshore oil exploration and pro­
duction in the central Beaufort Sea has created a general need 
to advance understanding of the dynamic physical conditions 
in the Beaufort Sea coastal region. Specifically, the Bureau 
of Ocean Energy Management requires information on the 
potential impacts that present-day and future sea-ice and 
atmospheric conditions will have on waves, currents, and 
sedimentation rates, and ice pile-up events during the expected 
timeframe of the offshore Liberty Development Project (about 
2020–50). Historical observational data were compiled and 
a coordinated field effort was completed in 2019 to better 
characterize the system and support model calibration and 
validation. USGS is developing a coupled wave-hydrody­
namic-sediment transport model to produce a 40-year hindcast 
(1979–2019) and projection (2020–49) of waves, storm surge, 
and sediment transport potentials within Foggy Island Bay and 
greater Stefansson Sound.

Coastal erosion is 
extensive in Alaska, threat­
ening coastal communities, 
infrastructure, and nearshore 
habitat. There is a need to 
determine rates and patterns 
of historical shoreline change 
along Alaska’s coast to sup­
port long-term planning and 
decision-making to ensure sus­
tainable coastal communities 
and ecosystems. As part of the 
USGS National Assessment of 
Shoreline Change and Alaska 
Coastal Processes and Hazards 
projects, USGS is quantifying 
rates and patterns of shore­
line change across the nation. 
By understanding the causal 
relationship between shoreline 
change and sediment move­
ment with forcings, such as coastal storms and atmospheric conditions, the USGS can develop better models for understanding 
long-term vulnerability from coastal hazards, thereby helping coastal managers and communities plan for a changing climate. 
Objectives of the projects include developing and improving coastal-change assessments, quantifying rates, and supporting long-
term planning and decision-making to ensure sustainable coastal economies, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Initial assessments 
are complete for the coast north of the Bering Strait to the U.S.–Canadian border. The next phase of analysis, started in FY2020, 
extends the study area south to the Yukon Kuskokwim Delta region. Updated rates will be calculated as new shoreline datasets 
become available.

Using Dendrochronology to Understand the Frequency and Magnitude of Snow Avalanches in Southeast Alaska
Snow avalanches affect transportation corridors and 
settlements throughout western North America. The City and 
Borough of Juneau (CBJ), Alaska, and surrounding region has 
the highest urban avalanche danger in the United States, with 
regular effects on people, property, critical infrastructure, and 
natural resources. The objectives of this project are: (1) to recon­
struct a chronology of large magnitude avalanches within the 
CBJ and the surrounding areas of concern, (2) to characterize 
specific synoptic weather and climate patterns associated with 
broad-scale avalanche incidence clusters, and (3) to identify 
relationships between avalanche incidence and specific ocean-
atmosphere teleconnections. The methods combine classical 
dendrochronological techniques with a novel nested spatial 
sampling design to develop a time series of large magnitude 
avalanche events. Combined with a LiDAR-derived, high-reso­
lution, comprehensive avalanche runout model, the results from this project inform stakeholders and partners of the frequency 
of avalanches that affect public safety and infrastructure. Products include a temporal and spatial dataset of large magnitude ava­
lanches in the region, reports to CBJ, a high-resolution map of maximum runout distances in areas at risk, and numerous public 
outreach products.

USGS Geomagnetism Program—Preparing the Nation for Intense Space Weather
While major geomagnetic storms are rare, there is significant potential for large-scale impacts when they happen. When a 
large sunspot emerges, the likelihood of an abrupt emission of radiation and intense solar wind increases. As these winds reach 
the Earth, electrically charged particles enter the Earth’s magnetosphere, ionosphere, and the interior of the planet, inducing a 
geomagnetic storm. The storm can interfere with utilities, infrastructure, and technologies essential to modern society, endan­
gering the economy and national security. The USGS Geomagnetism Program monitors the Earth’s geomagnetic field variation 
through operation of a network of fourteen observatories across the U.S. and territories (including five in Alaska) and pursues 
scientific research to estimate and assess geomagnetic and geoelectric hazards. Methods used integrate high-resolution and accu­
rate measurements of the geomagnetic signals, Earth surface impedance from magnetotelluric surveys, and statistical geoelectric 
hazard information. Products include time series that are used for space weather monitoring and prediction, and publications and 
maps of potential hazards to the U.S. electric grid.

Water Quality, Streamflow, and Ice Dynamics
Nationwide, the USGS Groundwater and Streamflow Infor­
mation Program supports the collection and delivery of stream­
flow and water-level information for more than 8,500 sites. 
Data are served online—most in near real time—to meet many 
diverse needs of stakeholders. The streamgages are operated and 
maintained by the USGS, but most are funded in partnership 
with one or more of about 1,400 Federal, State, local, and Tribal 
agencies or organizations. This unique cooperation results in 
nationally consistent and impartial water data that aids in local 
decision-making. Alaska has the lowest density of streamflow 
information stations in the Nation (112 streamflow sites in 2020, 
64 of which also measure water temperature). Streamgages are 
concentrated along the road system and near population centers, 
leaving many areas of the State devoid of any hydrologic infor­
mation. Operation of a streamgage in Alaska is expensive, owing 
to: complex logistics, personnel, and access to remote sites all 
contribute to high costs. The average installation cost of a USGS 
streamgage in Alaska is $30,000 (for materials and fabrication) plus installation logistics, which vary considerably. Streamflow 
data are recorded at 15-minute intervals, stored on-site, and then transmitted to USGS offices every 1–4 hours, depending on the 
data relay technique used. Provisional data are relayed to USGS offices by satellite, telephone, and radio telemetry where they 
receive an automated quality-assurance check and are available for public viewing within minutes of arrival. All real-time data 
are provisional and subject to revision after a formal review process that includes computation of annual statistics.

Continuous Monitoring and Baseline Assessment of Water Quality of Transboundary Alaskan Rivers
Multiple rivers, including the Salmon, Unuk, Stikine, 
Taku, and Alsek Rivers, originate in Canada and flow into 
Southeast Alaska. All five rivers support traditional, recre­
ational, and commercial salmon fisheries as well as recreation. 
Active and proposed largescale mining activity in the Canadian 
parts of these watersheds poses a potential threat to the fisheries 
and traditional lifestyles in Alaska. The objectives of monitor­
ing and assessing water quality of Transboundary Alaskan 
Rivers are to (1) assess the geology and mineralization potential 
of study area watersheds; (2) analyze retrospectively and collect 
new data to characterize the water, sediment, and biological 
quality of the rivers; and (3) establish partnerships with Tribes 
and government agencies to ensure that assessments meet 
the needs of Tribes and local stakeholders. Methods include 
updated geologic mapping and sample reanalysis, biological 
sampling, and discrete water quality sampling. Information 
on streamflow and water-quality conditions collected hourly 
at downstream monitoring sites will be paired with periodically 
collected samples that are analyzed for concentrations of metals, 
nutrients, and major ions. In combination, these data enable analysts to quantify loads of important water-quality constituents 
at daily, monthly, and annual time-steps. These data are the basis for identifying potential changes in water-quality conditions 
resulting from future upstream mining activities.

Developing Remote Sensing Methods to Measure Streamflow in Alaska Rivers
Obtaining timely, accurate information on streamflow 
in Alaska rivers is difficult because streamgages are sparse. 
Even for established monitoring stations, the maintenance and 
periodic measurements required to operate a streamgage pose 
logistical challenges and can place personnel at risk, particularly 
under high flow conditions. The core objective of this study is 
to develop and test remote sensing methods for measuring the 
river characteristics needed to estimate streamflow. In FY2021, 
we evaluated a method to estimate surface flow velocities from 
satellite video of a large, sediment-laden river in Alaska via 
particle image velocimetry. The accuracy of image-derived 
velocity estimates was assessed via comparison with direct field 
measurements made from a boat for our field site on the Tanana 
River. This research is significant because most Alaskan rivers 
do not have streamgages, thus efficient remote-sensing meth­
ods of measuring discharge could provide valuable streamflow 
information for water resource management and flood hazard 
mitigation. The goal is to operationalize these methods so that 
remote sensing can become a viable tool for the USGS and other 
stakeholders.

Alaska Streambed Scour Monitoring and Modeling
More than 60 percent of all bridge failures in the United 
States are caused by streambed scour, which is a result of 
complex hydraulic forces acting on streambeds during major 
flooding events. Costs associated with restoring damaged 
structures are substantial, but the indirect costs associated with 
the disruption of traffic often are even greater, especially in 
Alaska, where alternate travel routes between many cities do 
not exist. In cooperation with the Alaska Department of Trans­
portation and Public Facilities (AKDOT&PF), the USGS has 
been researching streambed scour through scour monitoring, 
hydrodynamic modeling, and data collection during high flows 
for several decades. Objectives of the streambed scour project 
are two-fold. The first objective is to monitor streambed eleva­
tions in real time at bridges coded as scour-critical and provide 
warnings to AKDOT&PF during scour events. Methods used 
include instrumenting bridges with sonars and stage sensors 
and collecting data during floods. The second objective is to 
predict hydraulic conditions that could lead to scour at bridges 
during floods using hydrodynamic models. This work enables 
State and Federal agencies to identify infrastructure that 
requires stream scour mitigation and/or annual monitoring for 
potential damage to infrastructure.

The Indigenous Observation Network 2.0: Impacts of 
Environmental Change on the Yukon and Kuskokwim Water­
sheds continues the Indigenous Observation Network (ION) 
long-term community-based water-quality monitoring project 
across Alaska and Western Canada. The ION 2.0 project is led 
by the Yukon River Intertribal Watershed Council in partner­
ship with the USGS and the University of Alaska-Fairbanks. 
ION 2.0 expands the observation and monitoring program to 
include measurements of changes in permafrost depth driven 
by a changing climate at multiple long-term water quality 
monitoring sites. This work builds on previous findings from 
ION that changes in major ion chemistry happened over three 
decades throughout the Yukon River Watershed because of the 
thawing of discontinuous permafrost. In addition to quantita­
tive data on permafrost thaw, this project entails integration 
of Indigenous knowledge to better understand local percep­
tions and knowledge of permafrost distribution in the region 
and locally. The COVID-19 pandemic emphasizes the ability 
and value of community-based monitoring programs to collect high quality data in hard–to–reach locations. Water-quality 
sampling continued successfully owing to the hard work and dedication of the community environmental technicians despite a 
global pandemic.

Quantifying Groundwater and Aufeis and Their Contribution to Surface-Water Availability and Habitat in the Arctic 
National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska
The North Slope of Alaska is a unique environment 
defined by continuous permafrost, abundant wildlife, and sub­
stantial industrial activity. Liquid water is a limited resource in 
this cold environment, with rivers providing important habitat 
and connections between terrestrial, freshwater, and marine 
ecosystems. Little is known about the relative contribution of 
precipitation and groundwater to rivers in this region, limiting 
the ability to properly use water resources.
Project objectives include quantifying water sources, 
aquifer size, and groundwater ages on Alaska’s North Slope 
and particularly in the 1002 region of the Arctic National 
Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). Methods include geochemical and 
remote sensing-based determinations of water sources and 
contributions to Arctic rivers, hydrological investigations of 
soil water and permafrost thaw potential, and isotopic age dat­
ing to determine aquifer properties and source areas. Results 
will provide critical quantification of water resources, aiding 
managers in balancing ecological and industrial requirements 
in this extreme, water-limited environment.

Glaciers
Glaciers are defining features of the physical landscapes in high 
mountains of western North America including Alaska. Mountain gla­
ciers profoundly affect the quality, quantity, and timing of runoff, local 
and regional ecosystems, global sea level, and land use. The primary 
objective of this project is to understand glacier mass change through 
time. Climate forcing has an immediate response in the form of sea­
sonal mass gains and losses, and a delayed response of the glacier flow 
field that results in cumulative changes to glacier thickness and area. 
Methods used to quantify these changes include field-based measure­
ments of winter accumulation, summer melt, and surface velocities, 
local weather stations, and remotely sensed changes in area and thick­
ness. Reanalysis of legacy data increases our confidence in the conclu­
sion that all five of the benchmark glaciers are losing mass, and the rate 
at which they are losing mass is increasing with time. Products include 
publicly available USGS data releases, summary data releases with the 
World Glacier Monitoring Service, and peer-reviewed publications.

Permafrost
Arctic Biogeochemical Response to Permafrost Thaw
Warming and thawing of permafrost soils in the Arctic 
are expected to become widespread over the coming decades. 
Permafrost thaw changes ecosystem structure and function, 
resources for wildlife and society, and the ground stability that 
affects human infrastructure. Since permafrost soils contain 
about half of the global soil carbon (C) pool, the magnitude of C 
losses from permafrost thaw is critically important to the global 
C cycle, known as the permafrost carbon feedback. The overall 
objective is to understand greenhouse gas (GHG) flux during 
the non-growing season from active-layer soils, permafrost, and 
supra-permafrost taliks, which are areas of unfrozen ground in 
permafrost areas in forests, bogs, and fens in Alaskan peatlands. 
Specifically, the study will 
(1) quantify the influence of talik formation and non-growing 
season processes on landscape-scale carbon dioxide and meth­
ane fluxes, (2) assess the quantity of old (millennial-aged) C lost 
from thawing permafrost soils and quantify and regionalize that 
loss, (3) examine the extent to which permafrost near 0 degrees 
Celsius is releasing GHG, and (4) compare the vulnerability of C 
losses among soils of different types and histories.

Hydrologic Change in Permafrost Systems
Permafrost exerts a major control on water movement 
and distribution across the landscapes of interior Alaska. 
As permafrost thaws, the subsurface becomes more perme­
able, enabling water and dissolved constituents to flow more 
freely and deeply below the surface. To better understand and 
quantify these complex dynamics, this project entails integra­
tion of subsurface measurement and modeling approaches to 
assess the vulnerability of permafrost in interior boreal Alaska 
and evaluate the impacts on hydrologic processes. Methods for 
subsurface characterization include borehole, ground-based 
noninvasive, and airborne geophysical techniques as well 
as soil sample collection for thermal and hydraulic property 
analyses. Data-informed hydrogeologic model simulations 
enable examination of the roles of climate change and land­
scape disturbance, such as wildfire, in influencing the rate and 
magnitude of permafrost thaw and consequent effects on water 
and solute fluxes. Fundamental understanding of permafrost 
hydrology provides the underpinning for model predictions of 
streamflow, groundwater availability, and surface-water distri­
bution in response to anticipated changes in air temperature, 
precipitation, wildfire, and vegetation. Projecting trajectories 
of water availability in interior Alaska is a primary objective 
of this effort.

USGS Climate and Permafrost Observing Network
The USGS, BLM, and FWS each have an interest in 
tracking long-term climate patterns in the National Petroleum 
Reserve in Alaska and the ANWR, where oil and gas explo­
ration and development/potential development are actively 
happening. This project maintains the collection and interpreta­
tion of long-term climate and permafrost data from an existing 
network of observing stations, which the USGS has operated 
since the late 1990s with the support of the BLM and FWS. Net­
work sensors include air temperature, soil temperatures, relative 
humidity, precipitation, wind speed, wind direction, barometric 
pressure, snow depth, and solar radiation. In-season and long-
term time series datasets from this program are essential to 
understanding natural environmental trends and variability in the 
Arctic, which informs land-use planning, permitting, and monitoring. Additionally, many of the parameters observed at these 
stations are drivers of regional water balance and strongly influence storage and runoff patterns, information that is critical for 
the interpretation of hydrologic and biologic datasets. Fieldwork and data management are completed by the USGS. Finalized 
data series will be released annually and archived within the Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost and the Global Climate 
Observing System.

Ecosystems
The polar bear is recognized worldwide as a species 
vulnerable to changing climate because of loss of its required 
sea ice habitats. USGS science played a central role in inform­
ing the decision to list the polar bear as threatened under the 
Endangered Species Act in 2008. This science was founded in 
understanding gained from long-term studies of the southern 
Beaufort Sea (SB) population, 1 of 19 worldwide, and 1 of only 
2 polar bear populations with long-term data. In these studies, 
the USGS documented a negative relation between length of 
the open water season over the continental shelf and population 
growth rate. Applying future sea ice conditions to the rela­
tion between sea ice availability and population growth rate 
enabled us to project a future trajectory of the population. We 
are monitoring the survival and habitat use of the SB popula­
tion to determine whether the habitat base for this population 
changes as projected and whether the population responds to 
those habitat changes as projected in 2007. Information about how polar bears in this population respond to sea ice loss informs 
management of the subsistence harvest, permitting of oil and gas activities in Alaska’s coastal plain, and projections for the 
worldwide population.

Pacific Walrus Research
The Pacific walrus is one of four marine mammal species 
managed by the DOI. The ASC conducts long–term research 
on Pacific walruses to inform local, State, national, and interna­
tional policy makers regarding conservation of the species and 
its habitat. The goal of current research is to refine and enhance 
models to forecast future walrus abundance and distribution in 
response to changing Arctic conditions and human activities. 
The initial phase of current work began with the collection of 
population age structure data in three consecutive years (2013–
15) from the Chukchi Sea during ship-based research cruises 
in collaboration with FWS and ADF&G. These field efforts 
provided updated estimates of walrus population age structure, 
and together with data from surveys repeated over the past four 
decades, provided current information on population status and 
trends. Current collaborations between the USGS and the FWS 
will use these data to develop new statistical techniques to com­
bine traditional mark-recapture with kinship data to provide more robust estimates of walrus population size. Ongoing and future 
work includes Unoccupied Aircraft System population surveys of hauled out walruses in northwestern Alaska, assessments of 
walrus behavioral response to marine vessel interactions, and modeled linkages between future sea ice availability and walrus 
energetic requirements to population vitality rates.

Nearshore Marine Ecosystem Research
Nearshore ecosystems in Alaska include many resources 
that are of high ecological, recreational, subsistence, and eco­
nomic value. They are subject to influences from a wide variety 
of natural and human-caused perturbations, which can originate 
in terrestrial or oceanic environments. Our research is designed 
to evaluate sources of variation in the nearshore and how they 
influence resources of high conservation interest. Our stud­
ies address community members at every trophic level, ranging 
from intertidal macroalgae and kelps to benthic invertebrates to 
top-level predators such as sea otters, black oystercatchers, and 
sea ducks. Key issues addressed by our program include ecosystem recovery from the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill; in particu­
lar, studies of sea otters and harlequin ducks have provided unprecedented insights into the processes and timelines of recovery 
of vulnerable species. We have a long history, and ongoing efforts, of investigating population dynamics of sea otters and their 
effects on other components of nearshore ecosystems. We also study sea ducks, a group of waterfowl of high conservation con­
cern, evaluating factors on marine habitats that influence their distribution, abundance, and demography. A large component of 
our program is participation in Gulf Watch Alaska, which is designed to monitor marine ecosystem structure and function in the 
northern Gulf of Alaska.

Ecology of Terrestrial Vertebrates (Caribou, Moose, Sheep, Wolves, Bears) in Alaska
Understanding population dynamics, predator/prey rela­
tions, and habitat ecology of large, terrestrial mammals is 
critical for the management of these wildlife species in Alaska 
and elsewhere around the world. Research conducted by the 
ASC on terrestrial mammals is focused on informing DOI 
land and resource management decisions across Alaska. Our 
work provides timely and highly relevant scientific informa­
tion for management issues such as the response of caribou to 
a warming climate and human development, future changes 
in distribution and abundance, and the effects of changing 
habitats used for forage. Recent research objectives include 
(1) continued monitoring of the Denali National Park caribou 
herd, (2) data summary and report on the population dynamics 
of wolves in Denali National Park, and (3) continued discus­
sion with partners and stakeholders on future science needs.

Birds
Seabirds and Forage Fish Ecology Program
Seabirds serve as practical indicators of change in the 
marine environment—natural or human induced—because 
they can be readily monitored at colonies and at sea. USGS 
studies seabird population dynamics and feeding ecology for 
a variety of seabird species to better understand why seabird 
populations fluctuate over time and how natural and anthropo­
genic factors influence population biology. Findings from these 
studies are provided to DOI management agencies and other 
stakeholders to inform decisions. Long-term tasks that form 
the core of the ASC’s forage fish, seabird, and ecosystem stud­
ies include (1) compilation and analyses of data on the pelagic 
distribution of marine birds in the North Pacific relative to 
biological oceanography and changes in climate; development 
of methods for censusing and monitoring trends in seabird 
populations on land and at sea; (2) studies of oceanography, plankton, forage fish, and seabirds around major seabird colonies in 
Alaska; and (3) measuring the possible impact of algal toxins on seabird mortality.

Alaska supports more than 130 species of breeding land­
birds, including many that migrate to neotropical wintering 
areas. Population declines have been documented for several 
species over the past few decades and land managers in Alaska 
require information on possible drivers of population change, 
such as spruce beetle epidemics, fire, and disease. Little infor­
mation exists on the status of Alaskan landbird populations 
in relation to those of temperate regions. Objectives of this 
project are to (1) coordinate a cooperative, regional program 
to monitor population trends of landbirds breeding in northern 
ecoregions; (2) investigate relations between the distribution 
of breeding landbirds and terrestrial habitats at the landscape 
level; and (3) examine population dynamics governing popula­
tion trends. Methods used include annual ground surveys and 
banding to understand changes in population size and demog­
raphy over time.

bution and abundance of shorebird species in Alaska; 
(2) factors involved in driving population changes in Alaska 
and throughout the broad non-breeding distribution of these 
species; and (3) evaluation of new and emerging topics with 
this species group. Methods involve population genetics, satel­
lite telemetry and other tagging, and ground surveys.

habitats and the species they support. Although the proximity 
of these water bodies to contaminant sources is important, the 
intrinsic ecological properties of each habitat type can affect 
contaminant cycling and effects. The USGS Forest and Range­
land Ecosystem Science Contaminant Ecology Program works 
across a range of aquatic habitats in the Western United States 
and Alaska to (1) evaluate contaminant exposure, (2) assess 
the accumulation through the food web, and (3) quantify the 
biological effects in aquatic and aquatic-dependent wildlife. In 
addition, program scientists will measure the habitat, land­
scape, and land-use patterns that contribute to contaminant 
dynamics. For example, mercury, a toxic metal, may threaten 
seabird species such as the Kittlitz’s murrelet. To evaluate 
possible impacts, the USGS measured mercury concentrations 
in Kittlitz’s murrelet eggshells, guano, blood, and feathers 
from four locations in Alaska. Results of this study indicate 
that mercury concentrations from two Kittlitz’s murrelets at 
Glacier Bay National Park and one at Adak Island were greater 
than those associated with impaired reproduction in other bird 
species and may merit further study to determine the potential 
threat of mercury at the population scale.

Epidemic of Beak Deformities (Avian Keratin Disorder) Among Wild Bird Populations
Thousands of land birds from 30 different species in 
Alaska have been reported with grossly deformed beaks since 
January 1998. Most sightings have been concentrated in south-
central Alaska, primarily in black-capped chickadees. Outside 
Alaska, there have been about 300 reports of individuals of 
more than 80 species of wild birds with similarly deformed 
beaks scattered across North America. The geographic dis­
tribution of deformities and high prevalence among resident 
birds suggest an acute, ecosystem-wide problem, but the cause 
and geographic origin of deformities are still unknown. The 
research objectives for this project are to determine (1) the 
factors causing the disease, (2) its geographic distribution, 
and (3) possible mitigation activities to limit continuation of 
the deformities in birds. Methods thus far to understand the 
disease have involved contaminant screening, genetic defect 
evaluation, changes in forage quality, bone and keratin evalua­
tion, and viral and bacterial factors.

Fish
Heat Stress in Alaska’s Pacific Salmon
Pacific salmon are cold-water fishes that historically have 
been limited by cold temperatures in Alaska. Rapid warming 
at northern latitudes has increased freshwater temperatures and 
raised the possibility that summer water temperatures in some 
of Alaska’s freshwaters are now stressful for migrating adult 
Pacific salmon. In this study we seek to understand whether 
contemporary water temperatures induce stress in Yukon 
River Chinook salmon, a population that failed to recover 
from decline. The methods integrate an experiment and field 
collections of muscle tissue samples for laboratory analysis 
of heat stress biomarkers (gene transcription and heat shock 
proteins) through collaborations with researchers from the 
USGS Western Ecological Research Center and Leetown Sci­
ence Center. In an experiment, salmon were placed in 18- and 
21-degrees Celsius water temperatures induced heat stress in 
a particular population. In subsequent field collections across 
the watershed, about one-half of the field-caught Chinook 
salmon had biomarkers consistent with heat stress. Given 
that heat stress increases the risk of in-river mortality prior to 
spawning and that salmon are managed by in-river counts of 
spawning adults, our findings suggest the potential for in-river 
abundance counts (that is, escapement) to overestimate the 
true number of spawning fish and result in overharvest.
Spawning Yukon River Chinook salmon captured as part of an 
experimental temperature manipulation study to validate heat 
stress biomarkers near Pilot Station, Alaska, June 2018. Muscle 
tissue sample required for the study fits in the small white plastic 
vial next to the fish. Photograph by Shannon Waters,

Nearshore Fish Surveys in the Beaufort Sea
In the Arctic, rapid changes in temperature and salinity 
have led to changes in locations where fish commonly found. 
Recent offshore survey efforts provide an opportunity to 
detect these changes and to compare fish abundance between 
offshore and nearshore habitats to understand whether near­
shore habitats are used for specific life stages (such as juvenile 
rearing, feeding, or reproduction). Updated information on fish 
community and use of nearshore habitats will provide manage­
ment agencies with improved understanding of risks of natural 
resource development and production in Federal waters for 
use in their assessments. For example, information from this 
study will support BOEM in assessing whether red-throated 
loons are behaviorally affected by industrial activities and 
whether nearshore fish communities are large enough and have 
adequate nutrition for reproductive success.

Habitat
Beavers Impacting Tundra Ecosystems—Quantifying Effects on Hydrology, Permafrost, Water Quality, and Fish Habitat 
in Noatak Wild and Scenic River Basin, Alaska
The North American beaver (Castor canadensis) has 
expanded beyond its historic range into tundra ecosystems, 
potentially impacting water quality, hydrology, and food 
webs of Arctic streams. Beaver dams create impoundments, 
flooding permafrost soils in tundra catchments and causing 
abrupt thaw. Our objective is to predict the consequences of 
beaver range expansion on the hydrology, water quality, and 
food webs of tundra ecosystems. Methods are to (1) quantify 
the local and downstream effects of beaver ponds on water 
quality and hydrologic conditions, and (2) assess how beaver-
induced changes affect fish growth and bioaccumulation of 
mercury. These data will provide a comprehensive examina­
tion of the physical, chemical, and biological consequences 
of beaver dams at the riverscape level and provide knowledge 
relevant to forecasting future changes in the Arctic. Results are 
intended to promote public education about beavers and their 
impacts to ecosystems.

Land Cover Classification and Change Detection on the Kenai Peninsula, 1973–2017
Across the Kenai Peninsula lowlands of south-central 
Alaska and over the last one-half century, disturbance events 
have removed large areas of forest while succession and 
landscape evolution have simultaneously facilitated forest 
regrowth and expansion. Although disturbance events and 
related land-cover change happen relatively fast, assessing 
patterns of post-disturbance succession requires long-term 
monitoring. The objectives of this study were to provide land 
managers quantitative data regarding where and when promi­
nent land-cover change has happened since 1973. Project 
methods involve classifying land cover type and quantifying 
land-cover change over time using Landsat legacy imagery 
for three historical periods on the western Kenai Penin­
sula: 1973–2002, 2002–2017, and 1973–2017. Scenes from 
numerous Landsat sensors were acquired from 1973 to 2017 
and were used to classify and track vegetation cover using a 
random forest classifier, which is a computer-based classifica­
tion algorithm. Land-cover types are summarized by era and 
spatially combined to produce a dataset capturing spatially 
explicit land-cover change at a moderate 30-meter resolution. 
Products include a spatially explicit dataset that quantifies 
land-cover types and transitions over time as well as a peer-
reviewed publication.

Habitat Dynamics—using Satellite Remote-Sensing in Landscape-Scale Wildlife and Ecological Process Studies
Atmospheric circulation patterns influence the timing of snow melt and vegetation green-up. At Barrow/Utqiaġvik, Alaska, years with 
late snow melt are associated with a blocking high-pressure system over the Arctic basin and low-pressure over the eastern Bering 
Sea which tends to block the flow of warm air into the higher latitudes. Source: Stone, R.S., Douglas, D.C., Belchansky, G.I., and Drobot,

The Habitat Dynamics Project entails examination of how short- and long-term changes in the environment affect the distri­
bution and survival of wildlife populations. Understanding linkages between the physical and biological environment is critical 
for making informed management decisions. This project is a focal point of capability and expertise for integrating remote sens­
ing, satellite telemetry, and GIS. Working collaboratively with other principal investigators, project participants apply satellite 
and software technologies to study spatial and temporal interactions between wildlife populations and their environment. Three 
primary objectives are to develop (1) wildlife distribution databases with emphasis on satellite tracking data, (2) environmental 
databases with emphasis on Arctic regions, and (3) GIS algorithms for integrated data analyses of habitat dynamics.

Rapid Ecosystem Changes in Tundra Biomes—Implications for Landscapes and Humans
The Yukon Kuskokwim Delta (YKD) encompasses the 
southernmost, warmest parts of the Arctic tundra biome and is 
renowned for its high biological productivity and subsistence-
based communities, which are isolated from the statewide road 
system. Recent and rapid environmental changes in this region 
include significant winter and spring warming, decreased 
sea ice extent, loss of snow cover, warming permafrost, and 
recurrent tundra fires, all of which cause significant changes in 
plant communities and primary ecosystem productivity. This 
project combines ecological ethnography with monitoring of 
key coastal resources and elements vulnerable to impacts from 
climate changes. The project was developed in response to 
growing awareness of rapid and potentially persistent climate 
change impacts to subarctic coastal ecosystems and the need 
to document impacts on Alaska Native villages and subsis­
tence resources. The YKD has been underrepresented in past 
studies of Arctic environmental change. In collaboration with 
the FWS and others, the USGS has developed a long-term 
monitoring project to detect recent ecosystem changes in tun­
dra biomes and provide our partners with predictions of when, 
where, and how future changes will likely happen.

Quantifying Large-Scale Aquatic Ecosystem Carbon Dynamics and Greenhouse Gas Exchange
Carbon and methane are cycled in inland waters (lakes, 
ponds, streams, and rivers) and water-inundated areas; how­
ever, there is large uncertainty in their significance to Arctic 
boreal region carbon emissions due to limited mapping and 
carbon measurements. USGS has been conducting large-scale, 
multi-year studies of carbon dynamics including carbon diox­
ide and methane exchange in the atmosphere, streams, rivers, 
lakes, and wetlands across Alaska and Canada in partnership 
with numerous agencies and academic collaborators. These 
studies improve estimates of carbon emissions in Arctic and 
Boreal inland water systems by integrating ground-based 
measurements of water chemistry and carbon gas fluxes with 
airborne data to spatially upscale greenhouse gas flux esti­
mates. Study results provide improved greenhouse gas emis­
sions estimates across diverse landscapes, and insights into the 
impacts of changing climate and permafrost on aquatic carbon 
dynamics.

Nutrient and Contaminant Metal Fluxes to Alaskan Coastal Surface Waters
The supply of the essential nutrients, phosphorus, 
nitrogen, and iron sets limits on various ecosystem biologi­
cal processes as diverse as the burial of carbon in terrestrial 
wetlands and biological productivity in lakes and the ocean. 
Project team members carried out fieldwork to sample and 
analyze dust in several remote Alaskan settings. A key objec­
tive has been to address whether Alaskan glacial flour dust, 
or Asian dust, or both, are important sources of the nutrients 
phosphorus, nitrogen, and iron to these terrestrial and marine 
ecosystems in coastal Alaska. A long-term objective is to infer 
whether the rates of key processes, such as nutrient cycling, 
are changing, and if so, why. Methods include time-series 
filtered air sampling on Middleton Island, which is approxi­
mately129 km (80 miles) south of Cordova, analyses of 
trapped particulates for trace element and isotopic tracers, and 
modeling of dust transport using the NOAA Hybrid Single-
Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model.

Early Warning Vital Signs in Arctic Network Parklands
Coastal Alaska is poised for rapid industrial and environmental 
change. Increased vessel traffic through the Bering Strait and the North­
west Passage, oil development in the region, and a planned deep-water 
port to support an increased U.S. presence in the Arctic, are likely to add 
considerable loads of contaminants to the Arctic ecosystem. Arctic eco­
systems are the most sensitive in North America, and total nitrogen input 
levels as low as 1 kilogram per hectare per year are expected to produce 
negative effects. The National Park Service intends to use the feather moss 
(Hylocomium splendens) as a cost-effective biomonitor to track the overall 
health of Arctic Park resources and provide early warning of resource 
degradation. Our objectives are to establish baseline depositional patterns of 
elements in H. splendens in Bering Land Bridge National Preserve (BELA), 
which is next to the Bering Strait, and to develop or refine statistical tools 
relating moss tissue concentrations to critical loads and injury thresholds in 
both BELA and Cape Krusenstern National Monument. Unfortunately, much 
of the laboratory work has been delayed until FY2022 due to COVID-19.

Assessing Baseline Contaminants in the 1002 Areas of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska
Federal agencies, including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, need to assess 
baseline levels and types of contaminants burdens in biotic and abiotic matrices 
in the coastal plain (the 1002 Area) of the ANWR prior to oil and gas exploration 
and development activities. This information will assist industry in understanding, 
minimizing, and mitigating the impacts of their activities. Baseline data can be used 
to (1) assess site-specific and area-wide development impacts, (2) address subsis­
tence concerns of ANWR users and nearby communities, (3) evaluate water quality 
impacts, and (4) if needed, serve in the Natural Resource Damage Assessment 
process. Methods include the chemical analysis of water, sediments, soils, vegeta­
tion, and biota (fish) for a suite of petroleum hydrocarbons and metals. Field work 
has been delayed due to COVID-19 but is expected to resume in 2022.

Earthmap use Case Development in Alaska
EarthMAP is the emerging 
conceptual mechanism that the 
USGS will develop over the next 
10 years to facilitate and apply 
more fully integrated, multi-
disciplinary science and techno­
logical advancements to meet 
decision-maker and stakeholder 
needs. Use Cases—as build­
ing blocks for EarthMAP—will 
identify high-priority science 
applications that advance the 
following three major compo­
nents of EarthMAP: (1) data and 
observation integration across 
disciplines and agencies, (2) 
integrated predictive science, 
and (3) actionable intelligence 
delivery at the speed and scale 
of decision-making. Use Cases 
are fundamentally driven by the 
needs of stakeholders and serve 
to identify existing and future USGS (and partner) science capacity and technological innovations that will service those needs. 
During this first year of EarthMAP Use Case planning, the Alaska Regional Office worked with Center Directors to develop and 
initiate five different Use Case prospects:
•	 Enhanced delivery of integrated ecosystem model output;
•	 Wildlife tracking portal to improve data documentation, delivery, and analysis;
•	 Machine learning analysis of near real-time imagery of U.S. volcanoes;
•	 Building an integrated coastal hazard assessment and mitigation strategy with Bering Sea communities of Alaska; and
•	 Customized Arctic map products for State, Federal, and international use.

USGS Changing Arctic Ecosystems Initiative
The objectives of the USGS Changing Arctic Ecosystems 
Initiative are to (1) quantify the responses (positive, negative, and 
stable) of wildlife species and their habitats to ecosystem change 
in the Arctic, (2) make information on these responses publicly 
available to inform management decisions related to development 
of oil and gas resources on BLM lands and on the Outer Conti­
nental Shelf managed by the BOEM, and (3) provide projections 
of likely future wildlife and habitat responses to inform DOI 
actions related to regulation or policy, Alaska Native subsistence 
and co-management actions, and new monitoring protocols and 
adaptive management strategies.

Collaboration with the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee
Established by an act of Congress in 1984, the Interagency Arctic Research 
Policy Committee (IARPC) functions under the White House Office of Sci­
ence and Technical Policy to set a coordinated agenda for federally funded 
Arctic research in the United States. IARPC aims to enhance scientific research 
and monitoring in the Arctic through facilitated coordination among Federal 
agencies and domestic and international collaborators. Since 2012, IARPC has 
jointly developed and implemented a 5-year national Arctic Research Plan. 
The 2022–26 Arctic Research Plan (ARP) was drafted with contributions from IARPC agencies and builds on input from the 
research community, State agencies, Tribal and non-governmental organizations, and the public. The USGS Director represents 
all DOI bureaus as the IARPC Principal. Consequently, many USGS personnel are actively engaged in IARPC activities, includ­
ing leadership roles on collaboration teams, and leadership roles in the planning and development of the 2022–26 ARP, with its 
associated Biennial Implementation Plan, and the final 2017–21 End of Plan Report. USGS staff will continue to coordinate with 
IARPC collaborators to implement the plan when it is finalized by the end of 2021.

The Sensitivity of Alaskan and Yukon Rivers, Fish, and Communities to Climate
Climate change is transforming Arctic hydrology. 
Changes including permafrost thaw and altered runoff hydrol­
ogy and river temperatures pose serious threats to Indigenous 
communities who rely on rivers for subsistence fishing; access 
to supplies and fuel; and as transportation corridors (especially 
during the winter months) for overland access to reach subsis­
tence resources, transport goods, and visit family and friends 
in neighboring villages. The objective of this project is to con­
verge Indigenous knowledge and western science to strengthen 
collective understanding of terrestrial hydrologic change in the 
Arctic and the potential impacts on rivers, fish, and Indig­
enous communities. A large interdisciplinary team including 
an Indigenous Advisory Council has formed to meet this 
objective. Methods include enhanced river monitoring using 
continuous collection of river temperatures and solute tracers 
at USGS gages in Alaska and communities participating in the 
Indigenous Observation Network. These data will inform a 
new state-of-the-art climate model that predict hydrology and 
river ice across Alaska and the Yukon River Basin. These data 
will feed fish bioenergetic models that can help predict fish 
resources in the changing Arctic. Indigenous knowledge will 
be combined with modeling results to develop storylines of 
change to support resilience in Indigenous communities.

USGS Emerging Wildlife Disease Project
Environmental health is defined by connections between 
the physical environment, ecological health, and human 
health. Current research within the USGS recognizes the 
importance of this integrated research philosophy, which 
includes study of disease and pollutants as they pertain to 
wildlife and humans. Alaska is a critical area for the study 
of environmental health because of its significant wildlife 
resources. Within the USGS, the Emerging Wildlife Dis­
ease project supports USGS scientists nationwide to address 
diseases of high concern to the United States. This project 
focuses on important wildlife disease topics relevant to 
Alaska such as avian influenza, bacterial and parasitic infec­
tions in wildlife, and Avian Keratin Disorder in landbirds, and 
responds to new topics as they arise.

Alaska Native Science and Engineering Program Partnership
The USGS Alaska Region partners with the University of Alaska Anchorage 
Alaska Native Science and Engineering Program (ANSEP), a comprehensive Science, 
Technology, Engineering, and Math program beginning with students in sixth grade 
and continuing through high school, into science and engineering undergraduate and 
graduate degree programs possibly through to the Ph.D. degree. ANSEP’s objective is 
to create systemic change in the hiring patterns of Alaska Natives in science and engi­
neering by placing students on a career path to leadership. USGS partners with ANSEP 
through a cooperative agreement, providing $50,000 per year to support the program. 
Currently, the USGS is in year 4 of the cooperative agreement with ANSEP, and this 
is the second agreement with the program. The USGS provides ANSEP students with 
opportunities to (1) work in a multi-disciplinary natural science environment that 
examines fish, wildlife, and lands in an ecosystem context; (2) conduct water and min­
eral resource assessments; (3) acquire a better understanding of natural hazards facing 
Alaska; and (4) use state-of-the-art tools, from the latest molecular genetics techniques 
to geospatial information technologies. USGS funds these student hires at a cost of 
$10,000 per year.

Science Center.
The Alaska Tribal Resilience Learning Network (AK TRLN) is a community of learning, sharing, technical assistance, 
training, and support for Alaska Tribes and Indigenous communities as they respond to the impacts of climate change. This sys­
tem of support is a joint effort launched in early 2021 by the USGS’s Alaska Climate Adaptation Science Center (https://akcasc.
org/), the Aleutian Pribilof Islands Association (https://www.apiai.org/), and the University of Alaska Fairbanks. AK TRLN is 
designed for Alaska Tribes and Indigenous communities addressing their climate adaptation priorities, especially those that have 
received Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Tribal Resilience Program funding.
In its first year the AK TRLN developed a series of virtual information sessions that explained upcoming funding oppor­
tunities and explored current and emerging topics in climate change adaptation and resilience. The network hosted multiple 
training sessions such as “Climate Change Adaptation 101” and special training topics related to adaptation planning in Alaska 
Native communities. As the network grows, the focus will shift to direct support for Tribes and Indigenous communities work­
ing on climate change adaptation challenges, including changes in subsistence resource availability or access to subsistence 
resources. In coming years, we anticipate that the AK TRLN will become a vital link between researchers in USGS and its 
University of Alaska partners, while addressing critical science and information gaps throughout the region.

Translating Climate Information for use by Decision Makers in Alaska
The complex language of future climate projections can be daunting 
and inaccessible to resource managers and community leaders and the pub­
lic unfamiliar with use of research model outputs. Yet, an understanding of 
changes to the climate and ecosystem factors such as snowmelt, permafrost 
thaw, wildfires, and vegetation is vital for planning and managing resources 
into the future. The Alaska Climate Adaptation Science Center (AK CASC) has 
long-standing relationships with Federal, State, and Tribal partners that enable 
the co-production of research to directly inform management decisions through 
a deep understanding of what managers need and what scientists can deliver. 
Such partnership was illustrated in the development of a Vulnerability Assess­
ment for the Chugach National Forest in southcentral Alaska. Climate projec­
tions of future snowmelt conditions enabled the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) to 
determine which streams in the Chugach National Forest are most vulnerable to 
major shifts in hydrology over the next 50 years. The AK CASC has supplied 
or is supplying climate projections and ecosystem summaries for all the major 
Department of the Interior and US Department of Agriculture lands in the state, 
including all US Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, and U.S. 
Forest Service management units. These projections can be used in planning 
processes and in decisions about land and resource management.

Ecosystems Analytics
As analytical techniques have become more powerful, it is increas­
ingly difficult for scientists to become fluent in emerging statistical 
methods, GIS software, or data visualization. This has created a need 
to solicit help from expert data analysts to complete parts of projects 
or better design novel studies that can incorporate recently developed 
methods. The Ecosystems Analytics group at the ASC provides analyti­
cal support ranging from specific coding questions to general analysis 
assistance. Our goal is to save time spent analyzing data by those less 
familiar with certain techniques or improve inference by using novel or 
emerging techniques with existing data. The group helps with software 
coding, spatial analyses, regression, mixed-effects and hierarchical 
models, power analyses, sampling design, Bayesian models, web-based 
data applications, and web- and publication-quality figures. Projects are 
based on analyst ability and experience; time investment; and concor­
dance with DOI, and USGS, and ASC priorities.

Looking Forward, Looking Back–Building Resilience Today
Climate change impacts on landscapes are happening 
faster in the Arctic than elsewhere. For rural Alaska com­
munities, these impacts already require constant coping while 
preparing for future adaptation. The Alaska Climate Adaptation 
Science Center, Aleutian Pribilof Islands Association, Uni­
versity of Alaska, and five southwestern Alaska communities 
developed community-specific climate information and synthe­
sized it for effective risk assessments, climate adaptation plans, 
funding applications, and to solicit public comments. Using 
participatory methods, we conducted workshops and meetings 
to document: (1) topics of interest on climate, (2) concerns 
about impacts on subsistence practices, and (3) local observa­
tions of change due to climate variability. We developed com­
munity atlases of climate changes and impacts for watersheds 
in areas of interest. Communities noted changes in subsistence 
activities, ease of travel, species loss/gain, and harvest quality. 
Local observations include weather, climate, and permafrost 
changes and related impacts on infrastructure, travel, food security, archaeological sites, and purchasing decisions. Common 
themes have emerged in the data, but considerable sub-regional variation among communities exists. These atlases can serve as 
a foundation for community adaptation efforts.

North Pacific Research Board Collaboration
The North Pacific Research Board (NPRB) was created to recommend to the Secre­
tary of Commerce priorities for coastal and marine research in the Gulf of Alaska, Bering 
Sea, and Arctic Ocean for funding through an annual competitive and peer-reviewed grant 
program derived primarily from NOAA sources. The USGS Alaska Regional Office has 
represented DOI interests on the Board since its creation in 2001, advising on numerous 
strategic initiatives including (1) annual funding decisions, (2) long-term funding allocation 
strategies, (3) and improving the vitality and relevance of the NPRB Core Program.
In addition to the Core Program, NPRB allocates resources to long-term monitoring and 
Integrated Ecosystem Research Programs (IERPs) to increase understanding of the complex 
interactions among the physical, chemical, biological, and social processes that influence 
Alaska’s large marine ecosystems. To date, NPRB has funded three IERPs, and recently 
committed to a fourth. The first IERP (2007–14), conducted in partnership with the National 
Science Foundation, provided more than $50 million in research funding to improve under­
standing the Bering Sea in the context of a changing climate. The Gulf of Alaska IERP 
(2010–16) provided more than $17 million to investigate environmental processes and biological interactions that influence 
the survival, transport, settlement, and recruitment of larval and juvenile stages of commercially and ecologically important 
groundfish. The Arctic IERP (2016–21) pooled more than $18 million (including DOI funds) to advance understanding of the 
linkages between the northern Bering Sea and the Arctic. The Arctic IERP (2016–21) examined how productivity and biological 
rate processes established during spring in the Bering Strait region influence the ecology of the Chukchi Sea during summer and 
fall. The forthcoming IERP will document significant changes in the physical and biological environment in the Northern Bering 
and Chukchi Seas. Areas of interest include (1) how shifts in environmental conditions and processes may influence species of 
commercial, ecological and subsistence importance and (2) implications for state and federal fisheries management and commu­
nities that depend on these resources. During 2022–24, the Integrated Ecosystem Research Program will support: (1) synthesis 
research that builds upon the Arctic IERP and (2) an assessment phase for the future IERP centered in the northern Bering Sea.
Since its inception, NPRB has been a proud sponsor and one of the leading organizers of the Alaska Marine Science Sym­
posium, Alaska’s premier marine research conference. Usually, more than 700 people attend this 4-day annual conference in 
January.

Land-Sea Linkages in the Arctic Global Change R&D—Climate History & Past Environmental Change
Paleoclimate records in Arctic Ocean sediments 
(1) improve understanding of patterns and causes of Arctic cli­
mate change; (2) determine possible future climate change and 
impacts of Arctic Sea ice on mid-latitude weather; and (3) help 
decision-makers address issues of ecosystem health, endan­
gered species, energy policy, national security, and transporta­
tion. This project will entail investigation the changing Arctic 
using instrumental records of environmental conditions and 
sediment cores, over short (50-year) and long (about 400,000-
year) time frames. Marine sediment samples and cores will be 
used to document paleo-oceanographic changes during periods 
of glacial-interglacial climate variability. Pollen assemblages 
will be used for comparison of ocean and land-based changes. 
Primary research objectives include (1) evaluation of sea ice 
and climate variability in the Arctic using sediment cores as 
proxy records to support models projecting future ice, tem­
perature, and circulation; (2) connection of ocean, climate, and 
land-cover changes in Alaska during past interglacial periods; 
and (3) determination of baseline ocean temperature, sea ice, 
pH, and marine ecosystems prior to the instrumental period of 
the last few decades.

Steese National Conservation Area Science Strategy
Through the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980, 
Congress designated 1.22 million acres to the Steese National Conservation 
Area (NCA) to protect its special features, which include the Birch Creek Wild 
and Scenic River and surrounding habitat for caribou and Dall sheep. The 
Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages the Steese NCA within a mul­
tiple use and sustained yield framework, and the BLM uses science to inform 
management decisions and conserve the special values of the Steese NCA. The 
BLM and the USGS staff began collaborating in 2021 to develop the Steese 
NCA Science Strategy, which identifies scientific information needed to address 
management issues. Led by the USGS Alaska Regional Office, the BLM and the 
USGS are taking an interdisciplinary and landscape-scale approach to identify 
priority objectives to inform management of the diverse biological, recreational, 
cultural, and economic resources of the Steese NCA. The forthcoming science 
strategy will:
•	 Identify the scientific mission of the unit and synthesize legacy scientific 
data,
•	 Identify management issues and priorities that can be addressed by further scientific study,
•	 Develop a process to better integrate research findings into management decisions,
•	 Develop a system to organize and archive reports and communicate findings to the public, and
•	 Develop protocols that ensure scientific inquiry does not negatively impact the unit and its resources.
The Steese Science Strategy is expected to be released in the first quarter of 2022.
