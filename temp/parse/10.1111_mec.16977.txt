1  |  INTRODUCTION
Body shape variation is common across all vertebrates and has 
important consequences for an animal's ecology, locomotion, 
thermodynamics and even speciation (Arnold, 1983, 1992; Coyne 
& Orr,  2004; Friedman et al.,  2021; Ruff,  1991; Schluter,  1996, 
2000; Smith et al.,  2015). A major axis of this morphological 
variation is body elongation, which occurs within reptiles (Bergmann 
& Irschick, 2012; Losos, 2009; Wiens & Slingluff, 2001), carnivorous 
mammals (Law, 2019, 2021) and fishes (Friedman et al., 2020; Price 
et al., 2019; Ward & Mehta, 2010).
One of the most widespread and repeated patterns of eco-
morphological variation within both marine and freshwater fishes 
is variation in body shape and fin position, often associated with

Abstract
Divergence in body shape is one of the most widespread and repeated patterns of 
morphological variation in fishes and is associated with habitat specification and 
swimming mechanics. Such ecological diversification is the first stage of the explo-
sive adaptive radiation of cichlid fishes in the East African Rift Lakes. We use two 
hybrid crosses of cichlids (Metriaclima sp. × Aulonocara sp. and Labidochromis sp. × 
Labeotropheus sp., >975 animals total) to determine the genetic basis of body shape 
diversification that is similar to benthic-­pelagic divergence across fishes. Using a series 
of both linear and geometric shape measurements, we identified 34 quantitative trait 
loci (QTL) that underlie various aspects of body shape variation. These QTL are spread 
throughout the genome, each explaining 3.2–­8.6% of phenotypic variation, and are 
largely modular. Further, QTL are distinct both between these two crosses of Lake 
Malawi cichlids and compared to previously identified QTL for body shape in fishes 
such as sticklebacks. We find that body shape is controlled by many genes of small 
effect. In all, we find that convergent body shape phenotypes commonly observed 
across fish clades are most likely due to distinct genetic and molecular mechanisms.

divergence along the benthic-­pelagic axis (Burns & Sidlauskas, 2018; 
Hulsey et al., 2013; Kusche et al., 2014; Muschick et al., 2012; Price 
et al., 2019; Ribeiro et al., 2018; Robinson & Wilson, 1994; Rogers & 
Jamniczky, 2014; Schluter, 1996; Walker, 1997; Willacker et al., 2010). 
This morphological divergence occurs similarly in ancient fish radia-
tions (Ribeiro et al., 2018), at the macroevolutionary level (Claverie 
& Wainwright, 2014; Friedman et al., 2020; Larouche et al., 2020; 
Price et al.,  2019) and repeatedly at the microevolutionary level 
(Brachmann et al., 2021; Hatfield & Schluter, 1999; Walker, 1997).
Body shape and fin placement dictate how fishes navigate their 
ecological niches. For instance, fishes that live in environments with 
variation in structure and water flow generally have a deeper, more 
stout body thought to be adaptive for increased manoeuvrability and 
body rotation (Webb, 1982, 1984). A deeper caudal peduncle and 
more posterior placement of the anal and dorsal fins enable fishes 
to have fast propulsion as they move, change direction and adjust to 
varied water flow patterns in their complex habitats (Koehl, 1984; 
Webb, 1982). This body variation can be coordinated with changes 
in head shape, namely a shorter head region (Cooper et al., 2010). 
Alternatively, a narrow fusiform body shape is often associated with 
larger head proportions and is thought to enhance the performance 
of sustained swimming (‘cruising’) while minimizing drag in open 
water (Cooper et al., 2010; Friedman et al., 2020; Raffini et al., 2020; 
Schluter & McPhail, 1992; Webb, 1982, 1984).
We examine the genetic basis of body shape variation using 
a textbook example of adaptive radiation, cichlid fishes. Within 
cichlids, ecological divergence is critical to their adaptive radiation 
(Kocher, 2004; Streelman & Danley, 2003) and occurs repeatedly, in-
dependently and convergently in three expansive radiations in East 
African Rift Lakes (Cooper et al., 2010; Hulsey et al., 2013, 2018; 
Muschick et al., 2012; Ruber & Adams, 2001) as well as smaller radi-
ations within New World crater lakes (Elmer et al., 2010; Franchini 
et al., 2014; Kusche et al., 2014). Notably, hybrids among different 
cichlid species or even genera can be produced in the laboratory, en-
abling quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping of phenotypic variation 
(Powder & Albertson, 2016).
We therefore capitalized on the genetics and extensive pheno-
typic variation of cichlids to investigate the genetic basis of body 
shape divergence, a major axis of fish diversification. First, we deter-
mined the genetics of body shape within each cross, using species at 
varying points along a body shape morphological continuum. This al-
lows us to examine if different aspects of body shape variation have 
similar or distinct regulatory bases, which has important implications 
for the evolution of these traits. Then, we compare if the genetic 
intervals and mechanisms of divergence are similar between the two 
hybrid crosses. If so, this would indicate a shared molecular control 
as animals evolve towards distinct body shapes. Second, we assess 
the genetic architecture of body shape evolution in cichlids. We ask 
if there are many genetic loci that each contribute small effects or 
few regions with large effects that regulate body shape. Body shape 
variation within stickleback fishes has been attributed to a combi-
nation of a few QTL with large effects and many QTL with small ef-
fects (Albert et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2016). Further, 
QTL for body shape and other morphological features in sticklebacks 
have been suggested to cluster on certain chromosomes, and these 
‘supergene’ regions can influence coordinated changes in phenotype 
(Albert et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2014; Miller et al., 2014). Finally, we ask 
if this common and predictable morphological trajectory in fishes has 
a predictable genetic basis by comparing QTL for body shape across 
multiple fish species. In other words, we determine if there is parallel-
ism in the genetics of body shape variation to accompany convergent 
morphologies among fishes. To accomplish these goals, we utilized 
two hybrid crosses of Lake Malawi cichlids, quantifying a suite of lin-
ear and geometric measures of body shape. We use QTL mapping to 
identify the genetic bases of these traits, which we then compare 
among traits, between crosses and to studies in other non-­cichlid 
fishes. Together, these data provide insights into the genetic control 
of a major ecological and morphological divergence in animals.
2  |  MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1  |  Animals and pedigree
All animal care was conducted under approved IACUC protocol 
14-­101-­O at North Carolina State University. Four species of Lake 
Malawi cichlids were used: Aulonocara koningsi, Metriaclima mbenjii, 
Labidochromis caeruleus and Labeotropheus trewavasae, hereafter re-
ferred to by the genus name. These fish have varied ecological speci-
fications and swimming mechanics. Aulonocara lives within an open, 
sandy region, away from the complex rocky habitat of the other 
species used here, and forages by cruising over the open sand. The 
Labidochromis species studied here lives in and around rocky habi-
tats, but is non-­territorial and swims continuously, darting among 
rocks in search of invertebrate prey. Metriaclima is a generalist rock-­
dwelling fish that often enters the water column, and Labeotropheus 
represents a more specialized rock-­dwelling morphology and be-
haviour (Cooper et al., 2010; Konings, 2016). Two hybrid crosses of 
these species were generated. The first cross came from a single 
Metriaclima female crossed to two Aulonocara males; the inclusion 
of the second grandsire was inadvertent and resulted from an unex-
pected fertilization event in these species with external fertilization 
(see ddRAD-­sequencing section for how this was addressed during 
genotyping). The second cross came from a single Labidochromis 
female crossed to a single Labeotropheus male. Thus, both crosses 
feature a fish that dominantly ‘cruises’, a pelagic swimming tactic, 
versus a more benthic species. For each cross, a single F1 family 
was generated and subsequently in-­crossed to produce F2 hybrid 
mapping populations. F2 families were raised in density-­controlled 
aquaria with standardized measured feedings until 5 months of age 
for analysis. Fish were anaesthetized with buffered 100 mg/L MS-­
222 for all photographs. Whole fish photographs were taken includ-
ing a colour standard and scale bar under uniform lighting conditions 
in a lightbox with a mirrorless digital camera (Olympus). The sex of 
each animal was determined based on gonad dissection and these 
data were omitted if there was ambiguity in gonad phenotype.

2.2  |  Linear quantification of body shape variation
We quantified various measures of body shape in 10 individuals of 
each parental species, 491 Metriaclima × Aulonocara hybrids and 447 
Labidochromis × Labeotropheus hybrids. From photographs, we calcu-
lated a series of linear distances (Figure 1b) using ImageJ software 
(version 2.1.0), including standard length (snout to posterior end of 
caudal peduncle), head length (snout to opercle), body depth (ante-
rior insertion of dorsal fin to insertion of pelvic fin), caudal pedun-
cle depth, distance between caudal peduncle and anal fin insertion, 
length of the anal fin base, distance between anal fin and pelvic fin 
and pectoral fin depth. ImageJ lengths in pixels were converted into 
centimetres using the scale bar included in each picture. Head pro-
portion was calculated by dividing head length by standard length. 
To remove the effects of allometry on body measures, all meas-
urements were converted into residual data by normalizing to the 
standard length, using a dataset including both parentals and their 
hybrids within a single cross. Analyses including linear normalization, 
ANOVAs, Tukey's Honest Significant Difference post hoc tests and 
Pearson's correlations were conducted in R (version 3.5.2).
2.3  |  Geometric quantification of body 
shape variation
Body shape variation was also quantified using geometric morphomet-
ric shape analysis with a common dataset for all four parental species, 
Metriaclima × Aulonocara hybrids and Labidochromis × Labeotropheus 
hybrids. Homologous anatomic landmarks were defined along the 
body primarily using fin insertion sites as well as head landmarks 
such as the snout, eye and opercle (Figure 1a). Coordinate positions 
of all landmarks were collected from photos using the tpsDig2 soft-
ware package (version 2.31, http://www.sbmor​phome​trics.org/). 
Landmark coordinates were extracted and uploaded into the R 
package geomorph (version 3.1.3) (Adams & Otarola-­Castillo, 2013), 
which was used to conduct Procrustes superimposition of landmarks 
to remove variation due to size, rotation and position of landmarks 
to leave variation only due to shape. The effects of allometry were 
removed with size correction and multiple regression of shape on 
standard length, using a dataset including all parentals and all hy-
brids. Slopes of vectors of divergence were compared among pairs 
of groups using the procD.lm and pairwise functions in geomorph 
(version 3.1.3) using standard length as a covariate and 9999 per-
mutations per function to calculate p-­values among 95% confidence 
intervals (Adams & Otarola-­Castillo, 2013).
2.4  |  ddRAD-­sequencing
Genomic DNA was extracted from caudal fin tissue using DNeasy 
Blood and Tissue kits (Qiagen). Indexed, double-­digestion RADseq 
libraries were produced as previously described (Burford Reiskind 
et al., 2016) and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq with 100 bp paired-­
end reads (North Carolina State University Genomic Sciences

Laboratory core facility). Raw sequencing data were demultiplexed 
and low-­quality reads were excluded using the program process_
radtags (Stacks, version 2). The demultiplexed and filtered reads 
were aligned to the Maylandia zebra UMD2a reference genome using 
BWA with the mem algorithm. We used the programs pstacks and 
cstacks (Stacks, version 1) to identify RAD markers in each sample 
and create a catalogue of RAD markers present in both parents of the 
cross. The RAD markers of the progeny were subsequently matched 
against this catalogue with the program sstacks (Stacks, version 1). 
Genotype calls for biallelic markers with alternative alleles between 
the parents of the cross (aa × bb markers) were generated with the 
program genotypes (Stacks, version 1), requiring a minimum stack 
depth of 3 in order to export a locus in a particular individual. As 
mentioned above, in the Metriaclima × Aulonocara cross an inadvert-
ent fertilization event led to two grandsires. To mitigate potential 
genetic variation introduced by this and focus on species-­level dif-
ferences, markers were only used if both Aulonocara sires shared 
the same homozygous genotype and Hardy–­Weinberg equilibrium 
was met. Any phenotypic effects of genetic variation from a single 
grandsire (that is intraspecies variation) are expected to be diluted 
in this cross and therefore not be identified in the subsequent QTL 
mapping described below.
2.5  |  Linkage map
The genetic map was built on the R statistical platform (version 4.0.3) 
with the package R/qtl (version 1.44-­9) (Broman, 2009) and in-­house 
scripts available at https://github.com/kpowd​er/Biolo​gy2022. RAD 
markers were sorted and binned in linkage groups according to their 
position in the M. zebra UMD2a reference genome. Markers located 
in linkage groups with more than 20% of missing data and markers 
located in unplaced scaffolds with more than 40% of missing data 
were filtered out from the dataset. A chi-­square test was performed 
with the function geno. table() to detect markers with distorted 
segregation patterns; markers with a Bonferroni-­corrected p-­value 
<.01 were removed. The pairwise recombination frequencies among 
markers were calculated, and an initial map was estimated with the 
functions est.rf() and est.map(). Markers in linkage groups that did 
not show evidence of being misplaced were considered to be inflat-
ing the map and removed if they increased the size of the map by at 
least 6 centiMorgans (cM) and their flanking markers were less than 
3 Mb apart. Markers located in unplaced scaffolds were integrated 
into a given linkage group if they had recombination frequency val-
ues <0.15 with at least five markers from that linkage group. The 
remaining markers located in unplaced scaffolds were removed 
from the map. Markers whose recombination frequency profile did 
not match their position in the genetic map, likely due to being lo-
cated in structural variants or misassembled regions of the refer-
ence genome, were rearranged manually in order to minimize the 
number of crossovers. The function calc.errorlod() was used to de-
tect genotyping errors; genotypes with a LOD score ≥3 were set as 
missing data. The map was pruned using a non-­overlapping window 
algorithm that selected the marker in a given 2 cM window with the 
least amount of missing data. The final map was estimated and the 
maximum likelihood estimate of the genotyping error rate (0.0001) 
was obtained with the function est.map(). The final genetic map for 
Metriaclima × Aulonocara hybrids included 22 linkage groups, 1267 
total markers, 19–­127 markers per linkage group and was 1307.2 cM 
in total size. The final genetic map for Labidochromis × Labeotropheus 
hybrids included 22 linkage groups, 1180 total markers, 42–­81 mark-
ers per linkage group and was 1239.5 cM in total size.
2.6  |  Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis
Quantitative trait loci mapping used multiple-­QTL mapping (MQM) 
methods. Scripts are described in and available from (Powder, 2020), 
follow (Jansen,  1994) and use the R/qtl package (version 1.44–­9) 
(Arends et al., 2010; Broman et al., 2003). The process begins with 
a liberal scan for unlinked QTL using the onescan function in R/qtl 
(Broman,  2009). Putative QTL with a LOD approaching or above 
3.0 were used to build a more rigorous statistical model. The MQM 
method use these putative loci as cofactors during a QTL scan, veri-
fied by backward elimination. The inclusion of cofactors in the final 
model provides more accurate detection of QTL and assessment of 
their effects (Jansen, 1994). The statistical significance of QTL was 
assessed using 1000 permutations. For QTL peaks meeting 5% (sig-
nificance) or 10% (suggestive) level, 95% confidence intervals were 
determined using Bayes analysis. Scan details such as cofactors used 
and significance levels are reported in Table S1.
Markers are named based on contig and nucleotide positions in 
the M. zebra (zebra mbuna) reference genome, M_zebra_UMD2a as-
sembly. Names, ID numbers and start/stop positions of candidate 
genes within QTL intervals were extracted from the NCBI genome 
data viewer (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genom​e/gdv) gene track 
for M. zebra annotation release 104. If upper and lower limits of the 
95% interval were markers that mapped to unplaced scaffolds, the 
closest marker that mapped to a placed scaffold was used instead. 
Gene names were compiled from the Database for Visualization and 
Integrated Discovery (DAVID) (Huang et al.,  2009a, 2009b) using 
NCBI gene ID numbers as a query.
2.7  |  Comparisons with other species
Quantitative trait loci intervals from other studies on body 
shape in different cichlid species (Franchini et al., 2014; Fruciano 
et al., 2016; Navon et al., 2017), sticklebacks (Albert et al., 2008; 
Conte et al.,  2015; Liu et al.,  2014; Rogers et al.,  2012; Yang 
et al., 2016) and carp (Laghari et al., 2014) were compiled, selecting 
for traits that were comparable with those studied here (i.e. similar 
measures to Figure 1). Orthologous positions in the M. zebra (zebra 
mbuna) UMD2a genome assembly were identified through man-
ual Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST, https://blast.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) to the M. zebra RefSeq genome (UMD2a 
 1365294x, 2023, 14, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mec.16977 by California Digital Library University Of California, Wiley Online Library on [31/03/2025].

assembly). For studies that only provided candidate genes 
within intervals (Franchini et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2016), cDNA 
sequences were used a query for a BLAST. For studies that in-
cluded marker information (Albert et al., 2008; Conte et al., 2015; 
Laghari et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2014; Navon et al., 2017; Rogers & 
Jamniczky, 2014), these regions were used as a query for a BLAST. 
For comparisons within cichlids, the 100 bp surrounding the nu-
cleotide position of the marker position was used. For previous 
studies in stickleback or carp, the ~400–­600 bp sequence of these 
markers was obtained from the NCBI Nucleotide database and 
used as a query. The physical positions in the M. zebra UMD2a 
genome were converted to genetic distances using the linkage 
map assembled for the Metriaclima × Aulonocara cross. We cross-­
referenced these regions and verified synteny using pairwise com-
parisons on the online tool Genomicus (https://www.genom​icus.
bio.ens.psl.eu) (Nguyen et al., 2022). Any regions with unclear or-
thologs or synteny were removed. Additional details such as traits 
and source of QTL information from previous studies are included 
in Table S7.
3  |  RESULTS
3.1  |  Body shape variation
Body shape in the four parental species differs in measures such 
as body depth and relative head proportions, which are common 
changes across benthic-­pelagic divergence in fishes, though differ-
ences were not observed in all measures taken (Figures S1, S2 and 
Table S2). For both crosses, F2 hybrids are largely intermediate in 
phenotype to the two parental species, though phenotypic variation 
in hybrids is increased and can surpass the morphological range of 
parental species (Figures 2, S1, S2). Lake Malawi cichlids are best 
characterized as a ‘hybrid swarm’, in which a set of standing ances-
tral polymorphisms are being shuffled in differing combinations 
among species (Brawand et al., 2014; Malinsky et al., 2018; Svardal 
et al., 2020). Thus, even for shapes with non-­significant differences 
between parental species, QTL mapping can identify genetic loci 
that underlie shape variation within this clade and genetic combina-
tions that are possible in other species (e.g. see pectoral fin depth for 
both crosses in Figures 3, 4, S1, S2).
Geometric morphometric shape analysis identifies coordinated 
changes in body shape in the bodies of the four parental species 
and F2 hybrids from both crosses (Figures 2, S3). Together, the first 
three principal components describe 64.2% of total shape variation 
(TSV) (Figure S3). Principal component 1 (PC1, 45.0% TSV) describes 
coordinated changes in body depth, eye size, placement of the pec-
toral and pelvic fins and head proportions (Figure  S3); these are 
all phenotypes associated with benthic-­pelagic divergence across 
fishes (Cooper et al.,  2010; Elmer et al.,  2010; Gow et al.,  2008; 
Hulsey et al., 2013, 2018; Schluter & McPhail, 1992). Notably, the 
four parental species are distinguished along this primary morpho-
logical axis (Figure 2), with Aulonocara representing a negative PC1 
score, Metriaclima and Labidochromis occupying the middle of the 
PC1 axis, and the Labeotropheus species having positive PC1 scores 
(Figure 2). The parents used in each cross demonstrate significantly 
different shapes (p-­values for pairwise comparisons of Aulonocara 
vs. Metriaclima = 4e−7, Metriaclima vs. Labidochromis = 0.9999 and 
Labidochromis vs. Labeotropheus < 1e−7) (Figure  2). In other words, 
the two crosses used represent a divergence in opposite directions 
along a common continuum of body shape. In all, PC1 segregates 
parental species (Figure 2b) and encompasses a large amount of total 
body shape variation (45%). Combined with the fact that parental 
variation is dominantly parallel to this axis (Figure 2a), these indicate 
the ecological relevance of this single principal component axis of 
shape.
Given that PC1 is biologically and ecologically informative, we 
focus just on this shape axis for the rest of the manuscript. This ap-
proach reduces a multivariate analysis of body shape to a single vari-
ate (i.e. just 45% of total shape variation). Therefore, we compared 
the angle of shape vectors among parental pairs to compare if the 
direction of multivariate shape (i.e. analysis including all principal 
components and 100% of total shape variation) was similar in the 
two crosses. No pair of parental species was significantly different 
in the vector angle of divergence (p = 0.2383–­0.9130, Table S3), sug-
gesting that the direction of their shape divergence is largely parallel 
and therefore predominantly represented by PC1 score. However, 
we do note that the Metriaclima × Aulonocara F2 hybrids and 
Labidochromis × Labeotropheus F2 hybrids did diverge in the direction 
of shape variation from each other (p = .001), though largely not from 
any of the parental populations (Table S3). One possible reason why 
these hybrid populations may diverge in multivariate shape, while the 
parental species do not, is the degree of transgressive phenotypes in 
the Metriaclima × Aulonocara F2 hybrids. In contrast, the phenotypes 
of the Labidochromis × Labeotropheus F2 hybrids largely fell within 
the phenotypic range of their parental species (compare range of 
hybrid phenotypes in Figure 2a, or range of hybrid phenotypes com-
pared to parentals in Figures S1b–­d vs. S2b–­d). We also observed 
that PC2 (11.6% TSV and describing relative body depth without 
changes in head proportion, Figure  S3) significantly distinguishes 
the Metriaclima × Aulonocara cross parentals (Figure S1), but not the 
Labidochromis × Labeotropheus parentals. Alternatively, PC3 (7.6% 
TSV representing head proportion and fin positioning, Figure  S3) 
is distinct between the Labidochromis and Labeotropheus parentals 
(Figure S2) but not between Aulonocara and Metriaclima parentals. 
The fact that these additional shape axes diverge between the 
crosses suggests that the primary divergence represented by PC1 
is then fine-­tuned towards specific ecological and functional optima.
Compared to Metriaclima, Aulonocara have significantly lon-
ger head proportions and a commensurate decrease in mid-­body 
length as measured by the length between the anal and pelvic fins 
(Figure S1 and Table S2). In agreement with linear measurements, 
Aulonocara fishes are significantly associated with a negative PC1 
score (Figures 2, S1 and Table S2), which characterizes a body with a 
larger head, a larger eye and posterior shifts of the dorsal, pelvic and 
pectoral fins (Figures S1, S3 and Table S2).

DELORENZO et al.
Despite both being rock-­dwelling Lake Malawi cichlids that 
live in sympatry (Konings, 2016), Labidochromis and Labeotropheus 
parentals have more significant phenotypic differences than the 
Aulonocara and Metriaclima species pair (Figures  2, S1, S2 and 
Table  S2). Labeotropheus species are specialized benthic fishes 
within Lake Malawi (Cooper et al.,  2010), and have significantly 
shorter head regions, decreased body depth, decreased cau-
dal peduncle depth, decreased anal fin length and increased 
length between the caudal peduncle and the anal fin compared 
to Labidochromis fish (Figure S2 and Table S2). In agreement with 
these linear measures, Labeotropheus is significantly associated 
with a positive PC1 score, associated with a narrower body shape, 
shorter head proportion and shorter anal fin (Figures S2, S3 and 
Table S2).
3.2  |  Sexual dimorphism in body shape
Differences between males and females, termed sexual dimor-
phism, are incredibly common across species and often include 
differences in body size or shape (Badyaev,  2002; Fairbairn 
et al., 2007; Frayer & Wolpoff, 1985; Williams & Carroll, 2009). We

therefore assessed differences between sexes in our two hybrid 
populations. Sex in Lake Malawi cichlids is genetically determined, 
with a diversity of sex determination loci identified (Gammerdinger 
& Kocher, 2018). Within the Labidochromis × Labeotropheus cross, 
sex is not associated with common sex determination loci, and of 
the 354 animals for which sex was called, 92.9% were male. In the 
Metriaclima × Aulonocara cross, sex is solely determined by a com-
mon XY system on LG7, which produces an even one-­to-­one sex 
ratio (Peterson et al., 2017; Ser et al., 2010). Thus, we only discuss 
sexual dimorphism based on 412 Metriaclima × Aulonocara hybrids 
(48.1% male), though see Table S2 for full ANOVA analyses in both 
crosses.
Overall size was the most significant body shape difference be-
tween males and females (standard length, Table  S2). Within the 
linear measures of body shape, males had significantly larger head 
proportions, body depth and length of the anal fin, which features 
egg spot pigmentation patterns used during mating (Table S2). This is 
supported by dimorphism in geometric morphometric shape analy-
ses, with males being associated with a negative PC1 score, including 
increased body depth and a larger head proportion (Figure S3 and 
Table S2).
3.3  |  Genetic basis of body shape variation
To determine the genetic mechanisms that underlie variation in body 
shape, we genetically mapped PC1 score representing complex shape 
changes (Figures 2, S3) and eight linear measures (Figure 1) to not 
only identify the genetic origins of each trait, but also compare these 
across different aspects of body shape. By doing this in both the 
Metriaclima × Aulonocara cross and Labidochromis × Labeotropheus 
cross that represent distinct body shapes within Lake Malawi

cichlids, we could also evaluate if common mechanisms control the 
evolution of body shape in distinct directions along a continuum of 
morphological variation (Figure 2).
Twenty genetic intervals underlie the quantitative differences in 
body shape in Metriaclima × Aulonocara F2 hybrids. This includes 13 
that reach 5% statistical significance at the genome-­wide level and 7 
that are suggestive, reaching 10% significance levels (Figures 3, S1, 
S4 and Table S1). Each trait has 1–­5 genetic intervals that influence 
phenotypic variation. QTL intervals are spread throughout the ge-
nome, with 12 of 22 linkage groups each containing 1–­2 loci. QTL 
regions explain from 3.2% to 7.6% of the total variation in each trait 
(Table S1 and Figure S4), meaning that all body shapes analysed are 
controlled by many genetic loci, each with a small effect.
A total of 13 significant and one suggestive QTL were identi-
fied in the Labidochromis × Labeotropheus F2 hybrids, with 0–­4 QTL 
per trait (Figures 4, S2, S5 and Table S1). Like the other cross, QTL 
are spread throughout the genome, with 10 of 22 linkage groups 
containing 1–­2 QTL each. Phenotypic traits are similarly complex in 
terms of genetics, with each QTL only accounting for 3.4–­8.6% of 
shape variation (Figure S5). Even for the trait with the most variation 
explained (body depth in Metriaclima × Aulonocara), only 19.3% of 
total shape variation is explained by the combined effects of 5 QTL 
(Figure S4 and Table S1).
Quantitative trait loci between the two crosses are largely non-­
overlapping both generally and for specific traits (Figures 3, 4, S1–­
S5 and Table  S1). The linkage groups that contain ‘hotspots’ with 
multiple QTL in one cross are largely absent from QTL in the other 
cross. For example, LGs 1, 11, 14, 18 and 19 each contain two over-
lapping QTL in the Metriaclima × Aulonocara cross, however, none of 
these LGs have a single QTL in the Labidochromis × Labeotropheus 
cross. Alternately, LGs 4, 12 and 20 each contain two overlapping 
QTL in Labidochromis × Labeotropheus cross, but no QTL in the 
Metriaclima × Aulonocara cross. This lack of common genetic signals 
is also the case when looking at individual traits. There is only one 
instance where the same trait maps to the same LG. In both crosses, 
LG15 contains a QTL for anal fin length (Figures 3 and 4). However, 
the 95% confidence intervals do not overlap, residing 23 Mb away 
from each other (Figures  3, 4 and Table  S1). Thus, two distinct 
FI G U R E 4 Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping identifies 14 intervals associated with changes in body shape between Labidochromis 
and Labeotropheus. Data are as presented in Figure 3. Illustrations of phenotypes are in Figures 1, S2, S3, and S5. QTL scans at the genome 
and linkage group level are in Figures S2 and S5, respectively. Details of the QTL scan including markers and physical locations defining each 
region are in Table S1.

DELORENZO et al.
genetic intervals control anal fin length in these crosses, but both 
happen to occur on the same linkage group.
However, there are some overlapping QTL within each cross, 
indicating that certain genomic intervals may have pleiotropic 
effects on body shape (Figures 3, 4 and Table S1). First, two QTL 
from the Metriaclima × Aulonocara cross overlap from 56.3 to 
58.0 cM on LG7, contributing to variation in standard length and 
head proportion (Figure 3). Notably, both traits are sexually dimor-
phic (Table S2), and the Y sex-­determining locus is nearby at 61.4–­
62.9 cM (Peterson et al.,  2017). Second, QTL for head proportion 
and the distance between the anal and pelvic fins overlap on LG11 
in the Metriaclima × Aulonocara cross, residing at 3.2–­29.5 cM. This 
‘hotspot’ may be explained by a large, previously characterized chro-
mosomal inversion on LG11 between Metriaclima sp. genomes and 
Aulonocara sp. genomes (Conte et al., 2019). Finally, two QTL co-­
localize in the Labidochromis × Labeotropheus cross from 29.2 to 58.8 
on LG12. This region underlies phenotypic variation in pectoral fin 
depth and caudal peduncle depth. This region of LG12 is also notable 
for a series of structural differences and changes in recombination 
rates among cichlid species (Conte et al., 2019). Thus, interspecific 
variation in structural features of the genome may account for in-
stances where QTL for disparate traits map to common intervals.
Allelic effects on phenotypes have a distinct trend for PC1 score in 
both crosses (Figures S4, S5 and Table S1). Namely, the allele inherited 
from the parent associated with a more positive PC1 score (Figure 2) 
increases this trait value in hybrids (1 QTL for Metriaclima × Aulonocara 
and 3 QTL for Labidochromis × Labeotropheus (Figures  S4, S5 and 
Table S1)). However, other than this trait, there are no clear trends 
when looking at allelic effects on phenotypes in either cross. For 
example, standard length in the Labidochromis × Labeotropheus cross 
is not significantly different between species, is controlled by 4 QTL, 
and at all four of these loci the derived Labeotropheus allele increases 
size, through a mixture of additive, overdominant and underdomi-
nant inheritance (Figure S5a).
Additional work will be needed to further clarify the molecu-
lar mechanisms through which phenotypic variation is generated. 
While some intervals have relatively few candidate genes (e.g. 
QTL for body depth on LG14 with only 11 genes), most of our in-
tervals contain hundreds of genes (Tables S5 and S6). While it is 
too early to speculate on the effects of specific candidate genes 
in these intervals, we looked for overlap between our body QTL 
and one gene previously implicated in trophic adaptations that 
commonly co-­occur with body shape variation in cichlids (Cooper 
et al.,  2010). Ptch1 variation produces alternate shapes in the 
lower jaw that represent a trade-­off between two feeding mech-
anisms: suction feeding associated with more pelagic species and 
biting that is common within specialized benthic species (Roberts 
et al., 2011). Ptch1 co-­localizes with the LG12 QTL hotspot in the 
Labidochromis × Labeotropheus associated with depth of both the 
pectoral and caudal fins. Though this region is also associated with 
altered patterns of recombination, this leaves open the possibility 
that a gene such as ptch1 may have pleiotropic effects on multiple 
phenotypes associated with cichlid divergence.
3.4  |  Modularity of body shape variation
The presence of genetic intervals linked to multiple phenotypes 
suggests that a single locus may have pleiotropic effects on multi-
ple aspects of body shape variation. We wished to further address 
whether body shape variation involves coordinated changes, or if 
different aspects of body shape may be able to evolve indepen-
dently. To directly address the relationships among our measured 
phenotypes, we assessed correlations between all pairs of traits. 
For both crosses, standard length was positively and strongly as-
sociated with linear measures (e.g. r values from 0.846 to 0.963 
in the Metriaclima × Aulonocara cross, Table  S4). Note that geo-
metric morphometric analysis includes a size correction prior to 
principal component analysis. After removing the effects of size, 
residuals for each measure were not strongly correlated with each 
other (r values from −0.563 to 0.369 with a mean of −0.015 in the 
Metriaclima × Aulonocara cross, and r values from −0.412 to 0.340 
with a mean of 0.011 in the Labidochromis × Labeotropheus cross) 
(Table S4). While additional analysis such as examination of morpho-
logical integration will be important to further define these patterns 
of shape co-­variation, this lack of correlation among phenotypes 
suggests that despite some traits having overlapping genetic influ-
ences (i.e. QTL), the phenotypic patterns generated are distinct.
4  |  DISCUSSION
4.1  |  Evolution of an ecologically important trait
We sought to understand the genetics of an ecologically impor-
tant trait, body shape, using multiple hybrid crosses of Lake Malawi 
cichlids and a series of both linear and geometric shape measure-
ments. We find numerous differences in body shape including body 
depth, head proportions, caudal peduncle depth and shifting of fin 
insertions that are likely to have functional consequences for swim-
ming manoeuvres. This series of changes in the body plan seen in 
the cichlids used here mirrors variation commonly seen along the 
benthic-­pelagic axis in fishes. Further, the divergence of body shape 
between sympatric Labidochromis and Labeotropheus emphasizes 
that while these fish encounter similar functional challenges of liv-
ing in a complex rocky habitat, their distinct trophic niches are key 
factors driving variation in body shape. Specifically, the insectivore 
Labidochromis has larger head proportions, increased body depth, 
a deeper caudal peduncle, a shorter caudal region and a longer 
anal fin than the algae-­scraping Labeotropheus (Figure S2, Table S2) 
(Konings, 2016). These adaptations in Labidochromis are similar to 
fishes that use quick bursts of speed with abrupt shifts in direction 
(Meyers & Belk, 2014; Webb, 1984), and may reflect an ability of 
Labidochromis to quickly manoeuvre and pursue insect prey, while 
Labeotropheus feed by hovering and holding steady within water 
flows of the lake to graze on algae.
We then used QTL mapping to identify the genetic basis of these 
differences in body shape. We predicted that the same genetic

DELORENZO et al.
intervals would influence body shape traits in both crosses, given 
that these crosses represent different aspects of the same contin-
uum of shape variation (Figure 2). In other words, producing an elon-
gated body shape would be the same regardless of relative starting 
body shape. Contrary to our prediction, we found that QTL that 
control body shape variation between the open water Aulonocara 
and benthic Metriaclima fishes are distinct from those that influence 
variation between a benthic insectivore like Labidochromis and the 
benthic specialist Labeotropheus (Figures  3, 4 and Table  S1). This 
trend occurred for both a series of linear measures of body shape 
as well as for a measure of coordinated changes in body shape 
(Figure 1). It is possible that the identification of QTL was limited 
by our analytical approach. Specifically, PC1 score represented a 
large degree of total variation in body shape among the nearly 1000 
animals measured (Figure 2) and parental species did not vary in 
their direction of shape variation in a multivariate analysis of body 
shape (Table S3). Nonetheless, we may not have identified overlap-
ping QTL for body shape (Figures 3 and 4) as we limited our genetic 
mapping to univariate measures of shape (i.e. PC1 score or linear 
measures) and the two hybrid populations did significantly vary in 
the direction of shape variation when accounting for multivariate 
measures of shape (Table  S3). Despite these limitations, the lack 
of overlapping QTL coupled with the modest effects of each QTL 
(3.2–­8.6% variation explained per loci, Table S1 and Figures S4, S5) 
emphasize that body shape is a complex, polygenic trait and similar 
morphologies can be produced by multiple mechanisms (a many-­to-­
one relationship).
4.2  |  Distinct genetic signals regulate body shape 
across fishes
Body elongation in fishes along the benthic-­pelagic axis occurs re-
peatedly and widely across fish phylogeny, independent of time 
(modern vs. historic) and environment (marine vs. freshwater) (Burns 
& Sidlauskas, 2018; Friedman et al., 2020; Gow et al., 2008; Hulsey 
et al., 2013; Muschick et al., 2012; Ribeiro et al., 2018; Robinson & 
Wilson, 1994). In ‘replaying life's tape’ (Gould, 1989), it is clear that 
fishes have converged on similar body shapes based on ecological 
selection. However, it remains unknown if fish species use similar 
genetic mechanisms to achieve these predictable morphologies. 
Towards this goal, we compared the QTL in this study with QTL 
identified in additional Lake Malawi species (Navon et al.,  2017), 
crater cichlids from Central America (Franchini et al., 2014), paral-
lel radiations of sticklebacks (Albert et al., 2008; Conte et al., 2015; 
Rogers et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2016) and carp (Laghari et al., 2014) 
(Figure 5, Table S7). This comes with caveats such as missing data 
due to unclear orthologous regions in the M. zebra genome used 
here, the inclusion of only some fish species, and similar, yet not 
identical measures in other studies. Despite this, our comparative 
approach can still identify if these parallel divergences in body shape 
could share common genetic mechanisms across multiple fish clades.
Overall, we find relatively minimal overlaps in QTL from 
our study and previous analysis of body shape in other fishes 
(Figures 3–­5). For instance, regions that have multiple QTL in this 
work (e.g. LGs 1 and 19 for the Metriaclima × Aulonocara cross or 
LGs 4 and 20 for the Labidochromis × Labeotropheus cross) have 
not been identified in previous analyses. However, there are two 
instances where there is an overlap in QTL from this study and 
previous studies, which also describe similar traits. The first is on 
LG7, where a QTL for head proportion in Metriaclima × Aulonocara 
overlaps with a QTL for head length in carp (Laghari et al., 2014) 
from 52.27 to 58.01 cM (Figures 3 and 5). A second overlap occurs 
on LG10, which has been associated with QTL in three of the pre-
vious seven studies (Figure 5). One of these overlaps with a QTL 
from this study, for PC1 shape in the Labidochromis × Labeotropheus 
cross. Interestingly, 9.16–­13.41 cM on LG10 is associated with body 
depth in other Lake Malawi cichlids (Navon et al., 2017), and PC1 
shape in our work also describes differences in relative body depth 
(Figures  2, S3). While this small number of overlapping intervals 
may identify common genetic intervals that regulate body shape in 
multiple species, we largely find that the evolution of similar body 
shapes is due to divergent genetic mechanisms, both within cichlids 
and across fishes.
4.3  |  Impacts of evolutionary history on genetic 
architecture and modularity
Most body shape variation in stickleback fish is caused by few genes 
with large effects (10–­20% variation explained each) and clustered 
‘supergene’ regions that influence multiple phenotypes associated 
with benthic ecologies (Albert et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2014; Miller 
et al.,  2014; Yang et al.,  2016). In contrast to this, we find that 
body shape variation in Lake Malawi cichlids is due to many genes, 
each with a small effect (Figures S4, S5 and Tables S1, S5 and S6). 
Additionally, we find that QTL are largely spread throughout the ge-
nome (Figures 3 and 4), and there are minimal correlations between 
measurements (Table S4). The largely modular basis of body shape 
variation in cichlids has implications for evolutionary potential (i.e. 
evolvability) and phenotypic variation (Melo et al., 2016; Pigliucci & 
Muller, 2010; Wagner et al., 2007). Namely, as distinct phenotypes 
are largely controlled by discrete genetic intervals in cichlids, this al-
lows independent evolution of distinct morphologies, each of which 
could be subject to different patterns of selection.
While most of the genetic correlations identified show inde-
pendent segregation and phenotypic impacts, there are excep-
tions. One is found at the sex determination locus on LG7 in the 
Metriaclima × Aulonocara cross, where the multiple traits mapped 
to this region are also sexually dimorphic. Our study is unable to 
disentangle whether the LG7-­associated trait variation is sex lim-
ited (i.e. modulated by sex-­specific physiology during development, 
where sex is correlated to LG7 genotype), or results from allelic vari-
ation that is in linkage with the sex determination locus. If future

DELORENZO et al.
studies indicate the latter, this would support the hypothesis that 
sexual dimorphism in body morphology evolves from an accumula-
tion of sexually antagonistic alleles at sex determination loci, as has 
been suggested for sexual dimorphism in pigmentation (Albertson 
et al.,  2014; Roberts et al.,  2009). Two other hotspots containing 
multiple trait QTL include LG11 in the Metriaclima × Aulonocara cross 
and LG12 in the Labidochromis × Labeotropheus cross. There is clear 
evidence for an interspecific inversion at LG11 between Metriaclima 
and Aulonocara, and recombination patterns among different hy-
brid crosses suggest that LG12 has significant variation in structure 
among Lake Malawi cichlids (Conte et al.,  2019). Inversions and 
other structural variants can strongly suppress recombination, and 
this could support the evolutionary accumulation of complimentary 
adaptive alleles at multiple loci within broad haplotypes. Similar 
roles for inversions have been suggested in the parallel adaptation of 
sticklebacks (Jones et al., 2012), including the predictable fixation of 
certain inversion haplotypes within freshwater populations (Roesti 
et al.,  2015). Within the Lake Malawi radiation, where occasional 
interspecific hybridization occurs and likely supports evolution, in-
versions may preserve combinations of alleles that drive multiple, 
distinct traits in the same direction along body shape ecomorpho-
logical axis, while avoiding discordant phenotypes. Our observations 
indicate a need for additional work dissecting genetic variation at 
structural variants. This could determine whether multiple genes are 
involved, or whether the hotspots represent the pleiotropic effects 
of a single gene that happens to lie within a structural variant.
This different genetic architecture and pattern of genetic 
modularity within stickleback and cichlid fishes is likely due 
to their different evolutionary histories and ancestral states. 
Specifically, ancestral sticklebacks are marine, pelagic morphs

that have a strong selective pressure towards a freshwater, ben-
thic form when migrating into small lakes created by glacial re-
treat (Schluter & McPhail,  1992; Walker,  1997). On the other 
hand, cichlids evolved from a small group of generalist, riverine 
species (Malinsky et al., 2018) in sympatry towards multiple adap-
tive peaks. While ecological divergence is an important stage of 
the cichlid radiation and influences patterns of speciation, this is 
only one of many selective pressures (Kocher, 2004; Streelman & 
Danley,  2003). Further, the cichlid ‘hybrid swarm’ has extensive 
shared genetic variation and ongoing gene flow among fish with 
varying body shapes, which further influences the genetic archi-
tecture, modularity and evolutionary potential of morphological 
variation in cichlids (Brawand et al., 2014; Malinsky et al., 2018; 
Svardal et al., 2020).
5  |  CONCLUSIONS
Body elongation is common across animals. In fishes, the benthic-­
pelagic ecomorphological axis is a major source of phenotypic varia-
tion, encompassing a suite of body shape phenotypes. Using cichlid 
species with body shape variation that parallels the benthic-­pelagic 
axis in other fishes, we show that body shape variation is most likely 
due to distinct molecular signals in different fish clades or even at 
different points along a morphological continuum in a single radia-
tion. Through comparison of genetic mapping in two hybrid crosses, 
we show here that even the closely related cichlid species examined 
have distinct genetic architectures for this convergent trait. The ge-
netic loci we identify here additionally serve as candidates to under-
stand the molecular origins of an ecologically relevant trait, body 
shape variation.
