H2S is a well-known toxic gas and also a gaseous signaling molecule involved in many biological processes.
Advanced chemical tools that can regulate H2S levels in vivo are useful for understanding H2S biology as
well as its potential therapeutic eﬀects. To this end, we have developed a series of 7-nitro-1,2,3-
benzoxadiazole (NBD) amines as potential H2S scavengers. The kinetic studies of thiolysis reactions
revealed that incorporation of positively-charged groups onto the NBD amines greatly increased the rate
of the H2S-speciﬁc thiolysis reaction. We demonstrate that these reactions proceed eﬀectively, with
second order rate constants (k2) of >116 M1 s1 at 37 C for NBD-S8. Additionally, we demonstrate that
NBD-S8 can eﬀectively scavenge enzymatically-produced and endogenous H2S in live cells. Furthering
the biological signiﬁcance, we demonstrate NBD-S8 mediates scavenging of H2S in mice.
Introduction
Hydrogen sulde (H2S) has long been known as a toxic gas, but
recent studies indicate that H2S has important physiological
functions, leading to its inclusion as the third gasotransmitter
along with nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO).1–3
Endogenous H2S is enzymatically generated by cystathionine g-
lyase (CSE), cystathionine-b-synthase (CBS) and 3-mercaptopyr-
uvate
sulfurtransferase
(3-MST)/cysteine
aminotransferase
(CAT).4 H2S inuences a wide range of physiological processes in
mammals, ranging from vasorelaxation,5 cardioprotection,6 and
neurotransmission7 to anti-inammatory action8 and angiogen-
esis.9
Misregulation of H2S is associated
with numerous
diseases.10,11 Specially, low levels of endogenous H2S appears to
exhibit pro-cancer eﬀects, whereas higher concentrations of H2S
can lead to cell apoptosis and have anti-cancer characteristics.11
Complementing the importance of H2S in mammals, H2S in
bacteria and plants also plays many important functions.12,13 Due
to its wide biodistribution and complex behaviors in many
diseases, the physiological characters of H2S and the molecular
mechanisms in which H2S is involved need further investigation.
In addition, these factors support the development and rene-
ment of advanced chemical tools that can visualize,14 scavenge15
or release16 H2S in vivo and in related complex environments.
Signicant attention has focused on developing chemical
tools for H2S detection and delivery,14,16 but much less eﬀort has
focused on reducing H2S levels in complex environments.15,17
Such H2S elimination could be achieved by either inhibition of
H2S biosynthesis or by the selective scavenging of H2S. Though
CBS inhibitors have been reported to show anti-tumor activity,
many of CBS inhibitors target the pyridoxal-50-phosphate (PLP)
cofactor and therefore have low specicity or unwanted side
eﬀects.11b Complementing these challenges, both CSE and 3-
MST inhibitors are relatively underdeveloped.11a Moreover, H2S
can be produced from non-enzymatic processes,14 which
suggests that enzymatic inhibitors can only perturb certain
pools of biological H2S genesis. Recently, sulfonyl azides were
reported as highly eﬃcient H2S scavengers in buﬀers, enzymatic
systems, and living biological environments.15 It should be
noted that the H2S-mediated reduction of aryl azides to amines
results in generation of sulfane sulfur and polysuldes,15,18 both
of which are important reactive sulfur species that might
complicate such scavenging.19a Considering the in vivo biolog-
ical complex,19 our goal was to develop eﬃcient H2S scavengers
utilizing diﬀerent reaction mechanisms that not only scavenge

H2S eﬃciently, but also do not generate other reactive sulfur
species in the scavenging process with the long-term goal of
applying these toward in vivo systems.
A major challenge in the development of H2S scavengers is
developing fast chemical reactions that eﬀectively diﬀerentiate
the reactivity of biological nucleophiles (e.g. biothiols) from
H2S. To this end, we as well as others have previously reported
the H2S-specic thiolysis of 7-nitro-1,2,3-benzoxadiazole (NBD)
amine in 2013 (Fig. 1),20 which has enabled, amongst other
applications, the development of near-infrared H2S probes for
imaging of H2S in vivo.20c To further advance the development of
H2S scavengers, we report here that simple modications of the
NBD electrophiles can increase the reactivity of this platform to
enable eﬃcient H2S scavenging (Fig. 2) and apply these chem-
ical tools to scavenge H2S in buﬀer, serum, cells, and mice. We
believe that the present H2S scavengers could be useful tools to
study H2S biology as well as potential therapeutic agents in the
future.
Results and discussion
Compounds
NBD-S1
to
NBD-S8
were
synthesized
from
commercially available reagents by simply coupling NBD-Cl to
the desired amine or by reacting NBD-piperizine with 2-chloro-
1-methylpyridinium salt (Fig. 2). Compound identity was
conrmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and HRMS. All
scavengers were prepared in high yield in either one- or two-step
syntheses, which readily enables access to large quantities of
each scavenger.
To measure the rate of the prepared compounds with H2S,
we monitored the optical response of NBD-S1–NBD-S8 (5–10
mM) aer addition of H2S (6–600 equiv., using Na2S) in PBS
buﬀer (pH 7.4) at 25 C. An example of the observed reactivity is
shown for NBD-S2 (Fig. 3a), in which the starting absorbance
peak at 490 nm from the NBD moiety shis to 540 nm aer
reaction with H2S due to formation of NBD-SH.20b The reaction
kinetics were monitored by measuring absorbance data at
540 nm or 490 nm (Fig. S1†) and showed a clear isosbestic point
at 510 nm, which is consistent with a clean overall trans-
formation. The pseudo-rst-order rate constant, kobs was
determined by tting the intensity data to a single exponential
function (Fig. 3b). Plotting log(kobs) versus log([H2S]) conrmed
a rst-order dependence in H2S (Fig. 3c). The linear tting
between kobs and H2S concentrations gives the second-order
rate constant (k2) of 23.3 M1 s1 (Fig. 3d).
Using the above method, the H2S-mediated thiolysis rates for
the prepared NBD amines were measured, and these data are
summarized in Table 1. The thiolysis rates for the four, six, and
seven-membered ring amines (NBD-S1 to NBD-S4) are signi-
cantly diﬀerent, with the presence of the second amine group in
the ring appearing to be particular important. We hypothesized
that this increased rate could be due to protonation of the

piperizine nitrogen at physiological pH (e. g.: the pKa of 1-
methyl piperizine is 9).21 To verify this hypothesis, compounds
NBD-S5 to NBD-S8 with the functionlized second amine were
further tested. As expected, alkylation of the piperizine nitrogen
(NBD-S5) or inclusion of a positively charged pyridinium (NBD-
S8) signicantly increased the thiolysis reaction rates. For
example, k2 values for cationic NBD-S5 and NBD-S8 derivatives
were 70.2 M1 s1 and 76.2 M1 s1 at 25 C, respectively, which
are signicantly faster than the k2 values of the neutral NBD-S2
and NBD-S7 analogues. To further support these measure-
ments, we also performed kinetic analysis using uorescence
methods (Fig. S9 and S10†) for NBD-S5 and NBD-S8, which
aﬀorded k2 values of 71.6 M1 s1 and 78.3 M1 s1, respec-
tively, which are consistent with those from absorbance
measurements. We also measured k2 for NBD-S8 at 37 C, which
yielded a signicantly higher value of 116.1 M1 s1 (Fig. S11†),
and suggests that this compound can scavenge H2S eﬃciently at
physiological temperatures. The formation of the amine
product during the thiolysis reaction was conrmed by HPLC
and HRMS analysis (Fig. S12 and S13†). Taken together, these
data suggest that NBD-S5 and NBD-S8 are highly reactive
reagents toward H2S clearance.
We also obtained crystals suitable for single-crystal X-ray
diﬀraction studies of NBD-S7 and NBD-S8 (Fig. 4). In the solid
state, the piperazinyl heterocycles in NBD-S7 and NBD-S8 are in
twist-boat and chair conformations, respectively. Prior work
with electrophilic piperazine-containing cyanine GSH probes
has shown that the chair conformation is favorable for the
thiolysis reaction,22a which may help explain the increased
reaction rate of NBD-S8 when compared to NBD-S7. In addition,
the positive charge of NBD-S8 may favor reaction with anionic
HS, and prior work with probes for F has shown increased
rates for cationic versions of probes when compared to neutral
counterparts.22b
We also evaluated the stability, water-solubility, and selec-
tivity of NBD-S5 and NBD-S8. The plots of absorbance intensity
against the scavenger concentration (up to 100 mM) were linear
(Fig. S14 and S15†), suggesting the good solubility of NBD-S5
and NBD-S8 in PBS buﬀer (50 mM, pH ¼ 7.4, containing 2%
DMSO). Both NBD-S5 and NBD-S8 were shown to be stable in
PBS buﬀer, with no decomposition over 2 days (Fig. S16†). The
high selectivity of the NBD amines toward H2S over biothiols
were validated by HPLC analysis (Fig. S17†), suggesting the
thiolysis of the NBD amines is highly H2S-specic.20c We
propose that this high selectivity may originate from the
intrinsic low thiolysis reactivity for C–N bond cleavage (e.g.
NBD-S1), and that certain structural factors, such as the piper-
azine chair conformation and positively-charged group, may
contribute to the faster reactivity with HS (e.g. NBD-S5 and
NBD-S8). Therefore, NBD-S5 and NBD-S8 were further employed
as H2S scavengers in the following studies.

We rst tested the eﬃciency of H2S clearance by NBD amines
in PBS buﬀer (50 mM, pH 7.4), using the methylene blue assay
(MBA)23 to quantify H2S concentrations (Fig. S18–S21†). The
time-dependent H2S concentrations in the absence or presence
of NBD-S2, NBD-S5, or NBD-S8 are shown in Fig. 5. The
concentration of H2S slowly decreasd over time, which matches
previous observations.24 Under these conditions, both NBD-S5
and NBD-S8 can scavenge more than 50% H2S within the rst
2 min. Additionally, NBD-S8 can scavenge more than 90% H2S
within 5 min, suggesting it is a highly eﬃcient H2S scavenger in
aqueous buﬀer (pH 7.4). Based on these parameters, we used
NBD-S8 for subsequent applications. Considering H2S is a toxic
gas,2b we tested the ability of the NBD-S8 solution to remove H2S
in gaseous sample (Fig. S22†).25 The color change of NBD-S8
solution and MBA tests of the solution clearly suggested NBD-S8
could eﬃciently scavenge H2S when the H2S-containing gas was
passed through the NBD-S8 solution.
We further investigated the time-dependent H2S-scavenging
ability of NBD-S8 in the presence of biologically relevant
species. As shown in Fig. 6, the results suggest that the scav-
enging of H2S via NBD-S8 is not signicantly inuenced by the
presence of millimolar biothiols or other species. The scav-
enging of H2S in 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) was also eﬃ-
cient. For all tested samples, NBD-S8 could scavenge more than
90% H2S within rst 10 min. These data suggest that NBD-S8
should be an eﬃcient H2S scavenger in complex biological-
related systems.
Then we tested whether NBD-S8 could scavenge H2S in live
cells. We rst tested the cytotoxicity of NBD-S8 by the MTT assay
using HeLa cells which contain nearly no endogenous H2S. The
scavenger did not show cytotoxicity up to 50 mM concentration
(Fig. S23a†). Furthermore, the cell viability in the presence of 100
mM and 200 mM NBD-S8 is still greater than 90% and 80%,
respectively. These results suggest that NBD-S8 is biocompatible
for scavenging H2S in living cells. To conrm that the thiolysis
products of NBD-S8 (NBD-SH and S8-II) are not cytotoxic, we
evaluated the cytotoxicity in HeLa cells for 24 hours. NBD-SH did
not show any signicant cytotoxicity below 25 mM (Fig. S23b†).
The cell viability in the presence of 25 mM and 100 mM S8-II is still
greater than 90% and 80%, respectively (Fig. S23c†). We note that
under physiological conditions, the concentration of free H2S is
signicantly lower than 1 mM,19a meaning that we do not expect to
generate high micromolar levels of NBD-SH under normal scav-
enging conditions.
To measure H2S levels, we use the H2S-responsive uores-
cence probe Cy7-NBD (Fig. S24†).20c We used HT-29 (human
colonic carcinoma cells) cells for these experiments due to
recent reports that colorectal cancer cell lines exhibit increased
H2S production,11b which is likely due to the increased angio-
genesis needed for cancer cell growth and proliferation.9 We
used non-cancerous FHC (human fetal normal colonic mucosa)
cells as a negative control, which we expected to lower basal H2S
levels. To test whether NBD-S8 could function as an eﬃcient
H2S scavenger, we compared the uorescence response from
Cy7-NBD in FHC cells, HT-29 cells, and HT-29 cells treated with
NBD-S8 (Fig. 7a and S25†). We observed a signicantly higher
response from Cy7-NBD in HT-29 cells when compared to FHC
cells, as expected. Upon pre-treatment of HT-29 cells with 100
mM NBD-S8 for 10 min, the uorescence signals in HT-29 cells
signicantly decreased (Fig. 7b), which supports that NBD-S8
can eﬃciently scavenge endogenous H2S in HT-29 cells.
To further support the ability of NBD-S8 to scavenge H2S in
live cells, we also measured H2S levels in HeLa cells treated with
Fig. 7
H2S scavenged by NBD-S8 in live cells. (a) H2S levels in FHC and
HT-29 cells were visualized by the ﬂuorescence probe Cy7-NBD (10

D-Cys (100 mM or 200 mM), which can increase H2S biosynthesis
from the 3-MST pathway.4b,26 As expected, we observed a strong
red uorescence signal from the
D-Cys-treated cells in the
absence of NBD-S8 (Fig. 7c and S26†).26 In contrast, co-
incubation of D-Cys treated HeLa cells with 100 mM NBD-S8,
the cells displayed signicantly lower uorescence than that of
the control cells (Fig. 7d). Taken together with the data in HT-29
cells, these data suggest that NBD-S8 can be applied to eﬃ-
ciently scavenge enzymatically-produced and endogenous H2S
in live cells.
Encouraged by these results, we further examined the
feasibility of NBD-S8 for H2S clearance in normal nude mice
again using Cy7-NBD as an H2S reporter. Briey, mice were
intraperitoneally injected with probe only (negative control),
Na2S followed by probe (positive control), or Na2S followed by
NBD-S8 for 10 min and then probe. The mice were imaged using
an IVIS spectrum imaging system (PerkinElmer, USA) with
a 740 nm excitation lter. As expected, the mice injected with
Na2S and NBD-S8 displayed weaker uorescence signal than
that of the mice injected with Na2S (Fig. S27†). These results
implied that NBD-S8 still functions H2S clearance in vivo, and its
feasibility to scavenge endogenous H2S in live mice was further
examined. To investigate the ability to scavenge endogenous
H2S, NBD-S8 was administered to 3 mice via tail vein injection.
Aer 10 min, probe Cy7-NBD was injected to visualize the level
of endogenous H2S. As a control group, another 3 mice were
injected with Cy7-NBD only. As shown in Fig. 8, time-dependent
uorescence increase was detected primarily in the liver of mice
(group a), which is consistent with previous results from tissue
imaging.20c However, mice in (group b) exhibited comparatively
lower uorescence at each corresponding time point when
compared to group a (Fig. S28†). These results preliminarily
demonstrate that NBD-S8 can scavenge endogenous H2S at the
organism level.
Conclusions
In summary, we have developed H2S scavengers based on the
thiolysis of NBD amines. NBD-S8 shows clear reaction kinetics
toward H2S with 2nd order rate constants of up to 116 M1 s1 at
37 C and high selectivity toward H2S over other biologically
relevant species. NBD-S8 can eﬃciently scavenge H2S in
aqueous buﬀer, serum, gaseous sample, and live cells. Addi-
tionally, the high selectivity and reactivity of NBD-S8 toward H2S
enables eﬃcient H2S scavenging in live animals. Moreover,
NBD-S8 showed better stability in 5 mM GSH containing PBS
buﬀer (pH 7.4) than that of p-toluenesulfonyl azide (Fig. S29†),
a recently reported H2S scavenger. Considering in vivo biological
complexity,19 we propose that H2S scavengers via the H2S-
specic thiolysis of NBD amines may represent an emerging
class of eﬃcient scavengers for investigating H2S in complex
biological systems.

treated with NBD-S8 and Cy7-NBD via tail vein injection. In (group a)
mice were injected with Cy7-NBD (150 mM, 200 mL) only; whilst in
(group b) mice were pretreated with NBD-S8 (100 mM, 200 mL) for
10 min, and then Cy7-NBD.
