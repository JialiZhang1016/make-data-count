Advanced chemical tools that can regulate H  2 S levels  in vivo are useful for understanding H  2 S biology as well as its potential therapeutic effects. To this end, we have developed a series of 7-nitro-1,2,3-benzoxadiazole (NBD) amines as potential H  2 S scavengers. The kinetic studies of thiolysis reactions revealed that incorporation of positively-charged groups onto the NBD amines greatly increased the rate of the H  2 S-specific thiolysis reaction. We demonstrate that these reactions proceed effectively, with second order rate constants (  k  2 ) of >116 M  −1 s  −1 at 37 °C for  NBD-S8 . Additionally, we demonstrate that  NBD-S8 can effectively scavenge enzymatically-produced and endogenous H  2 S in live cells. Furthering the biological significance, we demonstrate  NBD-S8 mediates scavenging of H  2 S in mice. 

  We demonstrate that positively-charged NBD amines can effectively scavenge biological H 2 S in live cells and in mice.

In addition, these factors support the development and refinement of advanced chemical tools that can visualize,  14  scavenge  15  or release  16  H  2 S  in vivo and in related complex environments. 

 Significant attention has focused on developing chemical tools for H 2 S detection and delivery,  14,16  but much less effort has focused on reducing H  2 S levels in complex environments.  15,17  Such H  2 S elimination could be achieved by either inhibition of H  2 S biosynthesis or by the selective scavenging of H  2 S. Though CBS inhibitors have been reported to show anti-tumor activity, many of CBS inhibitors target the pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP) cofactor and therefore have low specificity or unwanted side effects.  11 b   Complementing these challenges, both CSE and 3-MST inhibitors are relatively underdeveloped.  11 a   Moreover, H  2 S can be produced from non-enzymatic processes,  14  which suggests that enzymatic inhibitors can only perturb certain pools of biological H  2 S genesis. Recently, sulfonyl azides were reported as highly efficient H  2 S scavengers in buffers, enzymatic systems, and living biological environments.  15  It should be noted that the H  2 S-mediated reduction of aryl azides to amines results in generation of sulfane sulfur and polysulfides,  15,18  both of which are important reactive sulfur species that might complicate such scavenging.  19 a   Considering the  in vivo biological complex,  19  our goal was to develop efficient H  2 S scavengers utilizing different reaction mechanisms that not only scavenge H  2 S efficiently, but also do not generate other reactive sulfur species in the scavenging process with the long-term goal of applying these toward  in vivo systems. 

 A major challenge in the development of H 2 S scavengers is developing fast chemical reactions that effectively differentiate the reactivity of biological nucleophiles (  e.g. biothiols) from H  2 S. To this end, we as well as others have previously reported the H  2 S-specific thiolysis of 7-nitro-1,2,3-benzoxadiazole (NBD) amine in 2013 (  Fig. 1 ),  20  which has enabled, amongst other applications, the development of near-infrared H  2 S probes for imaging of H  2 S  in vivo .  20 c   To further advance the development of H  2 S scavengers, we report here that simple modifications of the NBD electrophiles can increase the reactivity of this platform to enable efficient H  2 S scavenging (  Fig. 2 ) and apply these chemical tools to scavenge H  2 S in buffer, serum, cells, and mice. We believe that the present H  2 S scavengers could be useful tools to study H  2 S biology as well as potential therapeutic agents in the future. 

 Fig. 1  (top) The thiolysis of NBD amines used previously for H 2 S probe development. (bottom) Inclusion of cationic charge in the present system enables access to efficient H  2 S scavengers by thiolysis of NBD cyclic amines.       Fig. 2  Synthesis of NBD amines NBD-S1 to  NBD-S8 . The C–N bond cleaved by H  2 S-mediated thiolysis is highlighted in red in each structure.        Results and discussion  Compounds NBD-S1 to  NBD-S8 were synthesized from commercially available reagents by simply coupling  NBD-Cl to the desired amine or by reacting NBD-piperizine with 2-chloro-1-methylpyridinium salt (  Fig. 2 ). Compound identity was confirmed by  1 H and  13 C NMR spectroscopy and HRMS. All scavengers were prepared in high yield in either one- or two-step syntheses, which readily enables access to large quantities of each scavenger. 

 To measure the rate of the prepared compounds with H 2 S, we monitored the optical response of  NBD-S1–NBD-S8 (5–10 μM) after addition of H  2 S (6–600 equiv., using Na  2 S) in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) at 25 °C. An example of the observed reactivity is shown for  NBD-S2 (  Fig. 3a ), in which the starting absorbance peak at 490 nm from the NBD moiety shifts to 540 nm after reaction with H  2 S due to formation of  NBD-SH .  20 b   The reaction kinetics were monitored by measuring absorbance data at 540 nm or 490 nm (Fig. S1  † ) and showed a clear isosbestic point at 510 nm, which is consistent with a clean overall transformation. The pseudo-first-order rate constant,  k  obs was determined by fitting the intensity data to a single exponential function (  Fig. 3b ). Plotting log(  k  obs )  versus log([H  2 S]) confirmed a first-order dependence in H  2 S (  Fig. 3c ). The linear fitting between  k  obs and H  2 S concentrations gives the second-order rate constant (  k  2 ) of 23.3 M  −1 s  −1 (  Fig. 3d ). 

 Fig. 3  (a) Time-dependent absorbance spectra of 10 μM NBD-S2 towards 1 mM H  2 S in PBS buffer (50 mM, pH = 7.4, containing 2% DMSO) at 25 °C. (b) Time-dependent normalized signals at 540 nm of 10 μM  NBD-S2 towards different concentrations of H  2 S. (c) The reaction order of H  2 S was determined as the slope of plots of log(  k  obs )  versus log([H  2 S]). (d) The  k  2 was determined as the slope of plots of  k  obs  versus [H  2 S].       Using the above method, the H 2 S-mediated thiolysis rates for the prepared NBD amines were measured, and these data are summarized in  Table 1 . The thiolysis rates for the four, six, and seven-membered ring amines (  NBD-S1 to  NBD-S4 ) are significantly different, with the presence of the second amine group in the ring appearing to be particular important. We hypothesized that this increased rate could be due to protonation of the piperizine nitrogen at physiological pH (  e. g. : the p  K  a of 1-methyl piperizine is ∼9).  21  To verify this hypothesis, compounds  NBD-S5 to  NBD-S8 with the functionlized second amine were further tested. As expected, alkylation of the piperizine nitrogen (  NBD-S5 ) or inclusion of a positively charged pyridinium (  NBD-S8 ) significantly increased the thiolysis reaction rates. For example,  k  2 values for cationic  NBD-S5 and  NBD-S8 derivatives were 70.2 M  −1 s  −1 and 76.2 M  −1 s  −1 at 25 °C, respectively, which are significantly faster than the  k  2 values of the neutral  NBD-S2 and  NBD-S7 analogues. To further support these measurements, we also performed kinetic analysis using fluorescence methods (Fig. S9 and S10  † ) for  NBD-S5 and  NBD-S8 , which afforded  k  2 values of 71.6 M  −1 s  −1 and 78.3 M  −1 s  −1 , respectively, which are consistent with those from absorbance measurements. We also measured  k  2 for  NBD-S8 at 37 °C, which yielded a significantly higher value of 116.1 M  −1 s  −1 (Fig. S11  † ), and suggests that this compound can scavenge H  2 S efficiently at physiological temperatures. The formation of the amine product during the thiolysis reaction was confirmed by HPLC and HRMS analysis (Fig. S12 and S13  † ). Taken together, these data suggest that  NBD-S5 and  NBD-S8 are highly reactive reagents toward H  2 S clearance.

In the solid state, the piperazinyl heterocycles in  NBD-S7 and  NBD-S8 are in twist-boat and chair conformations, respectively. Prior work with electrophilic piperazine-containing cyanine GSH probes has shown that the chair conformation is favorable for the thiolysis reaction,  22 a   which may help explain the increased reaction rate of  NBD-S8 when compared to  NBD-S7 . In addition, the positive charge of  NBD-S8 may favor reaction with anionic HS  − , and prior work with probes for F  − has shown increased rates for cationic versions of probes when compared to neutral counterparts.  22 b   

 Fig. 4  ORTEP diagram (50% ellipsoid) for the molecular structure of NBD-S7 (a) and  NBD-S8 (b). The I  − counterion in (b) is omitted for clarity.       We also evaluated the stability, water-solubility, and selectivity of NBD-S5 and  NBD-S8 . The plots of absorbance intensity against the scavenger concentration (up to 100 μM) were linear (Fig. S14 and S15  † ), suggesting the good solubility of  NBD-S5 and  NBD-S8 in PBS buffer (50 mM, pH = 7.4, containing 2% DMSO). Both  NBD-S5 and  NBD-S8 were shown to be stable in PBS buffer, with no decomposition over 2 days (Fig. S16  † ). The high selectivity of the NBD amines toward H  2 S over biothiols were validated by HPLC analysis (Fig. S17  † ), suggesting the thiolysis of the NBD amines is highly H  2 S-specific.  20 c   We propose that this high selectivity may originate from the intrinsic low thiolysis reactivity for C–N bond cleavage (  e.g.  NBD-S1 ), and that certain structural factors, such as the piperazine chair conformation and positively-charged group, may contribute to the faster reactivity with HS  − (  e.g.  NBD-S5 and  NBD-S8 ). Therefore,  NBD-S5 and  NBD-S8 were further employed as H  2 S scavengers in the following studies. 

 We first tested the efficiency of H 2 S clearance by NBD amines in PBS buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4), using the methylene blue assay (MBA)  23  to quantify H  2 S concentrations (Fig. S18–S21  † ). The time-dependent H  2 S concentrations in the absence or presence of  NBD-S2 ,  NBD-S5 , or  NBD-S8 are shown in  Fig. 5 . The concentration of H  2 S slowly decreasd over time, which matches previous observations.  24  Under these conditions, both  NBD-S5 and  NBD-S8 can scavenge more than 50% H  2 S within the first 2 min. Additionally,  NBD-S8 can scavenge more than 90% H  2 S within 5 min, suggesting it is a highly efficient H  2 S scavenger in aqueous buffer (pH 7.4). Based on these parameters, we used  NBD-S8 for subsequent applications. Considering H  2 S is a toxic gas,  2 b   we tested the ability of the  NBD-S8 solution to remove H  2 S in gaseous sample (Fig. S22  † ).  25  The color change of  NBD-S8 solution and MBA tests of the solution clearly suggested  NBD-S8 could efficiently scavenge H  2 S when the H  2 S-containing gas was passed through the  NBD-S8 solution. 

 Fig. 5  H 2 S-scavenging curves of NBD amines or no scavenger in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) at 25 °C. Three scavengers (  NBD-S2 ,  NBD-S5 , and  NBD-S8 , 110 μM) were added to H  2 S solutions (100 μM). The H  2 S concentrations were measured using MBA. The results are expressed as mean ± S.D. (  n = 3).       We further investigated the time-dependent H 2 S-scavenging ability of  NBD-S8 in the presence of biologically relevant species. As shown in  Fig. 6 , the results suggest that the scavenging of H  2 S  via  NBD-S8 is not significantly influenced by the presence of millimolar biothiols or other species. The scavenging of H  2 S in 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) was also efficient. For all tested samples,  NBD-S8 could scavenge more than 90% H  2 S within first 10 min. These data suggest that  NBD-S8 should be an efficient H  2 S scavenger in complex biological-related systems. 

 Fig. 6  Time-dependent H 2 S-scavenging curves of  NBD-S8 (110 μM) in the presence of other species (inset) and H  2 S (100 μM). The H  2 S concentrations were measured using MBA. The results are expressed as mean ± S.D. (  n = 3).       Then we tested whether NBD-S8 could scavenge H  2 S in live cells. We first tested the cytotoxicity of  NBD-S8 by the MTT assay using HeLa cells which contain nearly no endogenous H  2 S. The scavenger did not show cytotoxicity up to 50 μM concentration (Fig. S23a  † ). Furthermore, the cell viability in the presence of 100 μM and 200 μM  NBD-S8 is still greater than 90% and 80%, respectively. These results suggest that  NBD-S8 is biocompatible for scavenging H  2 S in living cells. To confirm that the thiolysis products of  NBD-S8 (  NBD-SH and  S8-II ) are not cytotoxic, we evaluated the cytotoxicity in HeLa cells for 24 hours.  NBD-SH did not show any significant cytotoxicity below 25 μM (Fig. S23b  † ). The cell viability in the presence of 25 μM and 100 μM  S8-II is still greater than 90% and 80%, respectively (Fig. S23c  † ). We note that under physiological conditions, the concentration of free H  2 S is significantly lower than 1 μM,  19 a   meaning that we do not expect to generate high micromolar levels of  NBD-SH under normal scavenging conditions. 

 To measure H 2 S levels, we use the H  2 S-responsive fluorescence probe  Cy7-NBD (Fig. S24  † ).  20 c   We used HT-29 (human colonic carcinoma cells) cells for these experiments due to recent reports that colorectal cancer cell lines exhibit increased H  2 S production,  11 b   which is likely due to the increased angiogenesis needed for cancer cell growth and proliferation.  9  We used non-cancerous FHC (human fetal normal colonic mucosa) cells as a negative control, which we expected to lower basal H  2 S levels. To test whether  NBD-S8 could function as an efficient H  2 S scavenger, we compared the fluorescence response from  Cy7-NBD in FHC cells, HT-29 cells, and HT-29 cells treated with  NBD-S8 (  Fig. 7a and S25  † ). We observed a significantly higher response from  Cy7-NBD in HT-29 cells when compared to FHC cells, as expected. Upon pre-treatment of HT-29 cells with 100 μM  NBD-S8 for 10 min, the fluorescence signals in HT-29 cells significantly decreased (  Fig. 7b ), which supports that  NBD-S8 can efficiently scavenge endogenous H  2 S in HT-29 cells. 

 Fig. 7  H 2 S scavenged by  NBD-S8 in live cells. (a) H  2 S levels in FHC and HT-29 cells were visualized by the fluorescence probe  Cy7-NBD (10 μM), and the HT-29 cells were pre-treated with or without 100 μM  NBD-S8 . The nuclei were stained with DAPI. Red fluorescence images (top) and overlap of blue and red fluorescence images (bottom) are shown. (b) Average fluorescence of  N = 3 fields of cell images in (a). (c)  d -Cys-induced H  2 S levels in HeLa cells were visualized by  Cy7-NBD (10 μM), and the HeLa cells were treated with or without 100 μM  NBD-S8 . Overlap of blue and red fluorescence images are shown. (d) Average fluorescence of  N = 3 fields of cell images in (c). All emissions were collected at blue (450–550 nm, excitation at 405 nm) and red (650–750 nm, excitation at 647 nm) channels for DAPI and  Cy7-NBD , respectively. Error bars are means ± S.D. ***  p < 0.001. Scale bar, 30 μm.       To further support the ability of NBD-S8 to scavenge H  2 S in live cells, we also measured H  2 S levels in HeLa cells treated with  d -Cys (100 μM or 200 μM), which can increase H  2 S biosynthesis from the 3-MST pathway.  4 b ,26   As expected, we observed a strong red fluorescence signal from the  d -Cys-treated cells in the absence of  NBD-S8 (  Fig. 7c and S26  † ).  26  In contrast, co-incubation of  d -Cys treated HeLa cells with 100 μM  NBD-S8 , the cells displayed significantly lower fluorescence than that of the control cells (  Fig. 7d ). Taken together with the data in HT-29 cells, these data suggest that  NBD-S8 can be applied to efficiently scavenge enzymatically-produced and endogenous H  2 S in live cells. 

 Encouraged by these results, we further examined the feasibility of NBD-S8 for H  2 S clearance in normal nude mice again using  Cy7-NBD as an H  2 S reporter. Briefly, mice were intraperitoneally injected with probe only (negative control), Na  2 S followed by probe (positive control), or Na  2 S followed by  NBD-S8 for 10 min and then probe. The mice were imaged using an IVIS spectrum imaging system (PerkinElmer, USA) with a 740 nm excitation filter. As expected, the mice injected with Na  2 S and  NBD-S8 displayed weaker fluorescence signal than that of the mice injected with Na  2 S (Fig. S27  † ). These results implied that  NBD-S8 still functions H  2 S clearance  in vivo , and its feasibility to scavenge endogenous H  2 S in live mice was further examined. To investigate the ability to scavenge endogenous H  2 S,  NBD-S8 was administered to 3 mice  via tail vein injection. After 10 min, probe  Cy7-NBD was injected to visualize the level of endogenous H  2 S. As a control group, another 3 mice were injected with  Cy7-NBD only. As shown in  Fig. 8 , time-dependent fluorescence increase was detected primarily in the liver of mice (group a), which is consistent with previous results from tissue imaging.  20 c   However, mice in (group b) exhibited comparatively lower fluorescence at each corresponding time point when compared to group a (Fig. S28  † ). These results preliminarily demonstrate that  NBD-S8 can scavenge endogenous H  2 S at the organism level. 

 Fig. 8  Representative fluorescence images of mice which were treated with NBD-S8 and  Cy7-NBD  via tail vein injection. In (group a) mice were injected with  Cy7-NBD (150 μM, 200 μL) only; whilst in (group b) mice were pretreated with  NBD-S8 (100 μM, 200 μL) for 10 min, and then  Cy7-NBD .        Conclusions  In summary, we have developed H 2 S scavengers based on the thiolysis of NBD amines.  NBD-S8 shows clear reaction kinetics toward H  2 S with 2  nd order rate constants of up to 116 M  −1 s  −1 at 37 °C and high selectivity toward H  2 S over other biologically relevant species.  NBD-S8 can efficiently scavenge H  2 S in aqueous buffer, serum, gaseous sample, and live cells. Additionally, the high selectivity and reactivity of  NBD-S8 toward H  2 S enables efficient H  2 S scavenging in live animals. Moreover,  NBD-S8 showed better stability in 5 mM GSH containing PBS buffer (pH 7.4) than that of  p -toluenesulfonyl azide (Fig. S29  † ), a recently reported H  2 S scavenger. Considering  in vivo biological complexity,  19  we propose that H  2 S scavengers  via the H  2 S-specific thiolysis of NBD amines may represent an emerging class of efficient scavengers for investigating H  2 S in complex biological systems.
