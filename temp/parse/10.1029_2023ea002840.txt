Abstract Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an important greenhouse gas which destroys the ozone in the stratosphere.
Primary sources of atmospheric N2O are nitrification and denitrification in terrestrial soils and the ocean, and
the main sink is photolysis in the stratosphere. Studies have mostly focused on the climate‐related response of
N2O during glacial‐interglacial periods. However, its mechanism of variation during the Holocene remains
unclear. We present a high‐resolution N2O record from the South Pole Ice (SPICE) core covering the Holocene
epoch. The millennial‐scale N2O trend agrees with existing records. We constructed a Holocene composite
consisting of the new N2O measurements in SPICE and existing records from other ice core sites. The N2O
composite reveals four distinct periods of N2O variation during 11.5–10.0 ka, 10.0–6.2 ka, 6.2–2.2 ka, and
2.2–1.4 ka, including two maxima in 11.0–10.0 ka and 3.0–2.2 ka and minima in 8.8–6.2 ka and approximately
1.4 ka. Apart from these, our new high‐resolution record from SPICE shows a short‐term N2O decrease around
2.8 ka which is not observed in other records possibly due to lower sample resolution and/or higher age
smoothing. Comparison of our new Holocene N2O composite with the paleo‐proxy records suggests the
plausible linkage of major monsoon (Asian, North African, South and North American, and Australian‐
Indonesian monsoon) and upwelling (Arabian Sea and Eastern Tropical
South Pacific) regions in regulating the atmospheric N2O during the Holocene.
Plain Language Summary Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an important greenhouse and ozone‐depleting
gas. The growing level of N2O in the atmosphere is of global concern, and records of past N2O
variations can provide an essential context for understanding the links between N2O and climate change. In
this study, we report a new, high‐quality N2O record covering the Holocene epoch using an ice core
obtained from the South Pole. Our record shows four important periods of N2O variation during 11.5–10.0 ka,
10.0–6.2 ka, 6.2–2.2 ka, and 2.2–1.4 ka. These include two local N2O maxima in 11.0–10.0 ka and 3.0–2.2 ka
and minima in 8.8–6.2 ka and approximately 1.4 ka. Comparison with climate records suggests that the
variation in monsoon precipitation and ocean productivity contributed to centennial‐ to millennial‐scale N2O
variations during the Holocene.
1. Introduction
Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a significant atmospheric greenhouse gas that responds to climate variation and is
responsible for stratospheric ozone destruction (Prather et al., 2015). Anthropogenic emissions during industri-
alization have majorly contributed to the remarkable increase in atmospheric N2O concentration from ∼270 ppb
in 1750 to ∼332 ppb in early 2020 (Machida et al., 1995; Fluckiger et al., 2002; Rubino et al., 2019; N2O
hemispheric and global monthly mean from the ESRL/NOAA 2020). Recent estimates suggest an anthropogenic
contribution of ∼40% in the current total N2O emission (IPCC AR6, 2021), whereas 60% of the emissions
originate from natural sources. Terrestrial and oceanic sources account for ∼60% and ∼40% of N2O emissions
from the natural environment, respectively (Battaglia & Joos, 2018; Tian et al., 2020).
Variations in pre‐industrial N2O emissions from diverse sources are closely correlated with ecological processes
regulating the cycling of nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) on land and in the ocean (Gruber & Galloway, 2008). N2O
production is contingent on metabolic processes (nitrification and denitrification) performed by specific groups of
bacteria (Stehfest & Bouwman, 2006; Xu et al., 2017). Some hotspots of the globe, where major N2O contri-
butions from these processes occur include the terrestrial soils in the tropical forests and marine suboxic waters
around the major upwelling regions overlying the oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) (Babbin et al., 2015; Cohen &

Gordon, 1979; Joos et al., 2020). The net N2O produced during these processes depends on environmental
conditions and production pathways (Joos et al., 2020). These conditions include temperature, water and oxygen
levels, substrate availability etc. (Wang et al., 2018; Zhuang et al., 2012). The major terrestrial N2O effluxes are
associated with tropical areas, including Central and South America, Central Africa, and Southeast Asia (Xu
et al., 2017). In such areas, denitrification is predominant in producing N2O, with limited contribution from
nitrification under low oxygen conditions in soils (Joos et al., 2020).
On the other hand, primary sites for marine N2O emissions occur in coastal upwelling systems around major
OMZs (Agnihotri et al., 2006; Naqvi & Noronha, 1991). In the productive regions, microbial respiration during
the decomposition of organic matter leads to the formation of anoxic waters (less than 10 nmol L−1 of O2), also
known as oxygen‐deficient zones (ODZs) (Tiano et al., 2014). These ODZs are surrounded by a large volume of
hypoxic waters (below 20 μmol L−1 of O2), which accelerates denitrification at the core of the anoxic zone and
nitrification at the oxic‐anoxic interface, making OMZs one of the significant sources of N2O (Babbin et al., 2015;
Ji et al., 2015).
The primary sinks for N2O are the stratospheric photolysis of N2O by ultraviolet light and its chemical reaction
with excited oxygen (Minschwaner et al., 1998). N2O has a relatively long atmospheric lifetime (approximately
123 ± 10 years) and therefore mixes effectively in the troposphere, reflecting similar values globally for a
particular time (Prather et al., 2015). Hence, the N2O concentration retrieved from the ice cores can be a potential
proxy for studying variations in the global nitrogen cycle.
During the last few decades, several detailed ice core N2O records covering different aspects have been estab-
lished (Fischer et al., 2019; Flückiger et al., 2002, 2004; Schilt et al., 2010, 2013; Spahni et al., 2005). These
include the glacial‐interglacial N2O variability and millennial‐scale N2O variations since the last glacial period,
with a focus on N2O response to abrupt climate events (Fischer et al., 2019; Flückiger et al., 1999, 2002; Schilt
et al., 2010, 2013; Spahni et al., 2005). On a glacial‐interglacial timescale, concentrations of N2O fluctuate be-
tween 280 and 180 ppb during warm and cold periods, respectively (Schilt et al., 2013). These climate variations
have also been associated with changes in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) (Henry
et al., 2016; Pedro et al., 2018). The weakening of the AMOC causes a shift in the Intertropical Convergence Zone
(ITCZ) southward, leading to the weakening of tropical monsoon precipitation (Wang et al., 2007) as well as the
variation in OMZ strength around the Arabian Sea and Pacific Ocean (Pichevin et al., 2007; Schmittner
et al., 2007). Hence, rapid climate change (warming/cooling) is believed to affect both terrestrial and marine
sources of N2O production (Pichevin et al., 2007; Schmittner et al., 2007). Flückiger et al. (2002) focused on the
N2O variation during the entire Holocene and reported a local N2O minimum at ∼8 ka (thousand years before
present or ka where the present is 1950 CE). The study also suggested that the N2O record is more similar to the
CO2 record than the CH4 record during the Holocene. Ryu et al. (2020) studied the high‐resolution N2O records
for the last two millennia and reported a pronounced N2O minimum at ∼600 CE (∼1.4 ka) coeval with the
reorganization of tropical hydroclimate and changes in ocean productivity. However, the detailed feedback
mechanism responsible for the N2O‐climate relationship and its interdependence with terrestrial and marine
processes during the entire Holocene remains elusive owing to the lack of high‐resolution N2O records covering
the Holocene.
We present a new high‐resolution N2O record from the South Pole Ice (SPICE) core during the last ∼11 thousand
years. Additionally, a composite N2O record is constructed by combining the new measurements from SPICE
with the existing records from other ice cores. The results provide insight into the key drivers of atmospheric N2O
on millennial time scales during the Holocene.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Site Description
The SP14 core site is located near the geographical South Pole (89.99°S, 98.16°W) at a surface elevation of
2,835 m. The ice accumulation rate around the SPICE site is 8 cm water‐equivalent per year or w.e./yr (Lilien
et al., 2018; Mosley‐Thompson et al., 1999), and the annual mean temperature measured in the firn is −51°C
(Severinghaus et al., 2001). Under modern climatological conditions, the estimated age spread of enclosed air
for the SPICE site (calculated by the width of the age distribution curve at half height) is around 65 years
(Battle et al., 1996; Buizert, 2012). The age difference between trapped bubbles (gas age) and surrounding ice

(ice age) is referred to as the Δage (Bender et al., 2006). The Holocene value of Δage for the SPICE site is
∼1000 ± 50 years, calculated by a firn densification model and empirical matching of CH4 gas chronology
(Epifanio et al., 2020).
2.2. N2O Measurement
We applied a high‐precision wet extraction (double melt‐refreeze) method for SPICE ice, as Ryu et al. (2018)
described. We used 17–18 g of ice for each measurement. The ice cutting was performed in a walk‐in freezer
maintained at approximately −20°C. The trimmed ice pieces were placed in specially designed glass flasks and
bolted on a flat flange with a copper gasket for sealing under a high vacuum while attached to the vacuum
extraction line. Laboratory‐made bubble‐free high‐purity ice was also used for blank correction. The glass
sample cups were initially submerged in a pre‐chilled ethanol bath (−75°C) and evacuated for approximately
50 min to remove the ambient air in the flask and any contaminants on the ice surface. After evacuation, the ice
pieces were melted to liberate the enclosed air and collected in the headspace of each sample flask. Subse-
quently, the meltwater was refrozen before analysis. The concentration of N2O in the liberated air in the
headspace of each sample flask was measured using an Agilent 7890b gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a
micro‐electron capture detector. We analyzed standard air with an N2O concentration of 265 ppb from the
National Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration (NOAA) before and after the sample measurement. Due to
the high solubility of N2O in water, we repeated the N2O measurement during the second melt‐refreeze cycle,
which corrected ∼3% (6–8 ppb) of the total N2O concentration. Therefore, high‐precision wet extraction
(double melt‐refreeze) is an accurate method to obtain the precise N2O concentration in ice core samples, which
would otherwise result in 6–8 ppb lower concentrations with a single melt‐refreeze cycle (Ryu et al., 2018). A
total of 177 sample depths with at least two horizontal replicates were measured. The inter‐day precision during
the N2O measurement was determined by measuring more replicates (three or four) from 19 depths and
calculating their pooled standard deviation. Further, to calculate the overall N2O precision in the SPICE core,
including ice quality and experimental uncertainty, we selected long ice pieces (∼20 cm each) from five
different depths. Eight continuous measurements were done (at ∼2 cm intervals) from each of the five long ice
pieces (n = 40) (Table S1 in Supporting Information S1). The obtained raw N2O values were corrected for
gravitational correction using the average δ15N of N2 of the SPICE core during the Holocene (0.539 ‰) and the
following equation:
N2Ocorrected = N2Omeasured(1 −
ΔM δ15N
1000)
where ΔM = 15.05 g/mol which refers to the difference between the masses of air (28.96 g/mol) and mass of N2O
(44.013 g/mol). The gravitational correction decreased the final N2O concentration by ∼2.5 ppb. The average
analytical uncertainty for repeated measurements in SPICE is 1.3 ppb which is better than the uncertainties re-
ported in previous studies ranging between 2.5 and 3.6 ppb (Figure 1).
2.3. N2O Composite
We prepared a composite N2O record of the Holocene using our results from SPICE samples measured at 177
different depths and existing records from EPICA Dome C (EDC), Dronning Maud Land (EDML) (Flückiger
et al., 2002; Schilt et al., 2010), Talos Dome Ice (TALDICE), North Greenland Ice Core Project (NGRIP) (Fischer
et al., 2019), Law Dome (Rubino et al., 2019) and Styx and NEEM (Ryu et al., 2020) ice cores. The modern
records of N2O concentrations from atmospheric monitoring show an interhemispheric gradient of ∼0.8 ppb and it
is likely to be smaller during pre‐industrial time due to higher anthropogenic emissions in the Northern Hemi-
sphere (Ishijima et al., 2009), which is well within the individual analytical uncertainties of each ice core record.
Therefore, N2O records from Antarctic and Greenland ice cores were used without further inter‐hemispheric
correction in preparing the Holocene N2O composite. A correction for gravitational fractionation based on the
average δ15N of N2 at each ice core site was also applied to the other ice core records except Law Dome, which is
already corrected (Rubino et al., 2019). The N2O record from each ice core was synchronized to the common
WD2014 age scale (Sigl et al., 2016; See Supporting Information S1 for more details). For each record, the N2O
concentration is interpolated to get the yearly‐resolved N2O curves before constructing a composite N2O curve.
We used the Monte Carlo average (MCA) method with a 250‐year running average to understand the millennial‐

scale changes in atmospheric N2O during the Holocene. The uncertainty associated with the MCA record was
implemented by repeating the MCA algorithm 10,000 times (Figure 2 and Figure S1 in Supporting Informa-
tion S1). See Supporting Information S1 for more details on the MCA and uncertainty calculations.
2.4. Total Flux Calculations
N2O emissions were estimated by calculating the total N2O flux from the N2O composite using a two‐box
model (Figure S2 in Supporting Information S1). The box model of Schilt et al. (2014) was modified us-
ing the method by Ryu et al. (2020) to calculate the total N2O flux without using the N2O isotopologues (δ15N
and δ18O of N2O). Due to the lack of isotope data, we could not distinguish the N2O fluxes from terrestrial
and marine sources. The model assumed the stratosphere and troposphere as individual boxes where the
stratospheric N2O destruction and troposphere‐stratosphere N2O exchange were well constrained. The model
used the tropospheric N2O lifetime of 123 ± 10 years (Prather et al., 2015) and the stratosphere‐troposphere
mass exchange rate of 5.37 ± 0.26 × 1017 kg yr−1 (Ishijima et al., 2007) with a 250 yr cut‐off period (COP).
Each run was executed by random propagation within the uncertainty range of N2O concentration, N2O
lifetime, and stratosphere‐troposphere exchange rate using the Monte Carlo approach across all the possi-
bilities (n = 10,000). We also performed a sensitivity test of our 2‐box model for different N2O lifetimes and
stratosphere‐troposphere exchange rates fixed at the maximum, minimum and average values. Initially, we
fixed the N2O lifetimes to 133, 123 and 113 (std dev = 0) and performed runs for each scenario. We observed
a significant increase of ±0.85 TgN/yr in the total N2O flux with a decrease of 10 yrs in the N2O lifetime
which is similar to the 1 sigma uncertainty of our results of total N2O flux. We also performed a similar test
with the S‐T exchange rate for three scenarios by fixing the values to the maximum (5.63 × 1017 kg yr−1),
minimum (5.11 × 1017 kg yr−1) and average (5.37 × 1017 kg yr−1). The results indicate a significant change in

model (Figure S3 in Supporting Information S1).
3. Data Quality
The SPICE site has a fairly low ice accumulation rate of ∼8 cm w.e./yr, resulting in relatively high smoothing
in the gas record owing to gas diffusion and gradual bubble close‐off processes in the firn column. The CH4
age‐distribution curve for the firn densification model of the SPICE site suggests a width of approximately
65 years at half height (Battle et al., 1996; Buizert, 2012). Hence, any abrupt change in N2O from its preceding
or successive value within 65 years may be considered an outlier, as these would not be representative of the
actual atmospheric signals. Such outliers may arise owing to chemical interactions or microbial processes
(Fischer et al., 2019; Flückiger et al., 2002), and experimental errors arising from contamination during ice
trimming and/or drift due to background sensitivity of the GC experiments (Ryu et al., 2018). To overcome the
GC drift, we repeated the measurement using replicated ice samples from each depth after a few weeks and
averaged for the final N2O concentration (Figure 1). The average standard deviation for replicate measurements
was 1.3 ppb. The intra‐day precision was calculated by averaging the pooled standard deviation of daily blank
ice measurements, which is 1.8 ppb. The outliers in the multiple N2O measurements at five depths were
statistically rejected using the Grubbs test (Grubbs, 1969). The pooled standard deviation for samples measured
three or more times on different days was 1.8 ppb (n = 41). On the other hand, the pooled standard deviation of
continuous measurement of long ice pieces (at 2 cm intervals) was 2.5 ppb. Furthermore, the measured N2O in
the SPICE core over the last 2,200 years was compared with the high‐resolution N2O records of Styx and
NEEM ice cores (Ryu et al., 2020) (Figure S4 in Supporting Information S1); which demonstrates consistency

with the Styx and NEEM records measured in the same facility a few years prior (for the overlapping time
periods) (Figure S4 in Supporting Information S1). These observations suggest new SPICE N2O record
determined herein is reliable.
A well‐known concern for ice core N2O data is the possibility of in situ production of N2O (Flückiger et al., 2002;
Schilt et al., 2010). The in situ N2O production could result from biotic and abiotic origins (Rohde et al., 2008;
Samarkin et al., 2010). The microbes in ice may oxidize NH+
4 (substrate) to nitrate (nitrification) or reduce nitrate
to nitrogen gas (denitrification) and produce N2O as an in situ intermediate product (Phillippot et al., 2007;
Röthlisberger et al., 2000; Sowers, 2001). Such N2O production may contribute to high N2O concentrations
observed at specific depths depending on the concentration of impurities that facilitate the in‐situ processes. This
raises an important question as to whether all the N2O data measured in the SPICE core covering the Holocene
represent the atmospheric concentration or if some of them are elevated owing to in situ N2O production. In
general, ice from warmer periods, such as the Holocene, is expected to be least affected by impurities that are
carried by the dust deposited with snow (Fischer et al., 2019; Flückiger et al., 2002). This is due to the higher dust
deposition during glacial than interglacial periods (Schilt et al., 2010). It is worth noting that the ice in Greenland
typically contains higher levels of dust than the ice found in Antarctica. (Flückiger et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2020).
To assess these possibilities, we compared our N2O data with high‐resolution non‐sea‐salt calcium (nssCa2+)
concentrations (Winski et al., 2019) (Figure 3 and Figure S5 in Supporting Information S1).
nssCa2+ is an indicator of dust content in ice, which may indirectly correspond to the microbial content in the ice
samples (Röthlisberger et al., 2000). The fluctuations in high‐resolution N2O data did not significantly correlate
with the cm‐scale changes in the nssCa2+ record (see Figure S6 in Supporting Information S1). These obser-
vations suggest that the Holocene N2O record of the SPICE core may not be affected by Ca (dust)‐related in‐situ
N2O production. Overall, the new N2O measurements presented here have good reproducibility during replicate
measurements. On the other hand, the continuous measurement of long ice pieces (2 cm interval) also shows a
similar reproducibility at four out of five depths (Table S1 in Supporting Information S1). Considering the 65‐yr
width of the gas age distribution curve and accumulation rate (8 cm/yr) at the SPICE site, eight pieces used in
continuous measurement should represent ∼2 yr age, which should ideally have a similar N2O concentration.
However, one of the depth intervals (305 m) shows higher variation within 20 cm unrelated to Ca (dust), possibly
due to an additional factor that increases the observed variability on these short time intervals.

4. Results
Here, using SPICE, we extend the high‐resolution N2O record further to cover the last 11 ka (Figure 1). The N2O
data from the SPICE core are consistent with existing records on millennial timescales and reveal new details on
the multi‐centennial scale. The SPICE N2O concentration shows a variation of 20 ppb between 11 and 8 ka, with a
maximum of 273 ppb and a minimum of 253 ppb. From 8.0 ka to 3.3 ka, there was a gradual increase of 21 ppb in
SPICE N2O concentration, with a maximum of 274 ppb and a minimum of 253 ppb. Following this, there was a
sudden drop of 15 ppb in SPICE N2O concentration centering around 2.8 ka. Between 2.8 and 2.2 ka, the N2O
concentration at the SPICE site rose by 15 ppb, followed by an 18 ppb decrease between 2.2 ka and 1.4 ka. The
N2O minima (at 8.0 ka and 1.4 ka) and maximum at 2.2 ka observed in our high‐resolution data from the SPICE
site are also observed in other ice core records such as EDC, EDML, TALDICE, and NGRIP (Fischer et al., 2019;
Flückiger et al., 2002; Schilt et al., 2010) (Figure 2). However, the N2O minimum at 2.8 ka is not observed in the
existing low‐resolution records from other ice core sites. The maximum available data points between 2.5 and 3.0
ka are from SPICE which shows a significant drop in N2O concentration around 2.8 ka. The MCA curve of
SPICE‐only data between 3.5 and 1.0 ka shows a prominent 8 ppb (∼0.5 TgNyr−1) decrease around 2.8 ka (Figure
S1 in Supporting Information S1). On the other hand, the N2O record of Dome‐C does not show any change in
concentration around 2.8 ka, possibly due to higher smoothing and wider age distribution at Dome‐C than at the
SPICE site. This means that there could be several multi‐centennial atmospheric signals that may be observed
only in ice core records of lower age smoothing (e.g., Styx, NEEM, Law Dome or even SPICE) but may not be
archived in EDC, even in the higher sample resolution records. Hence, the short‐term N2O drop in SPICE at
around 2.8 ka may likely represent a true atmospheric signal which is not captured in other N2O records possibly
due to lower sample resolution and/or higher age smoothing.
We prepared an MCA N2O composite to cover the entire Holocene (considering the sample gaps in our new
SPICE record) by compiling our new N2O results with the available records from EDC, EDML, TALDICE, Styx,
NEEM, Law Dome, and NGRIP ice core (Law Dome, Styx, and NEEM cover only last ∼2 ka) averaged at
250 years (Figure 2). The main distinctive features of the Holocene N2O variations observed in our N2O com-
posite include two N2O maxima at approximately 11–10 ka and 3–2.2 ka, followed by minima at approximately
8–6 ka and ∼1.4 ka, respectively. These millennial‐scale features observed in our new N2O composite agree well
with the N2O composite record of Fischer et al. (2019). With the addition of new high‐resolution N2O mea-
surements from SPICE, Styx and NEEM sites, our new MCA composite shows 2–3 ppb lower N2O values as
compared to the MCA composite of Fischer et al. (2019) (Figure S7 in Supporting Information S1). Overall, we
observe a range of ∼15 ppb in N2O during the Holocene, along with four distinct periods of N2O change during
11.5–10.0 ka, 10.0–6.2 ka, 6.2–2.2 ka, and 2.2–1.4 ka. The most considerable N2O variation corresponds to the
beginning of the Holocene (between 11.5 and 11.0 ka), where we observed an abrupt ∼15 ppb increase in at-
mospheric N2O based on mainly previous published records (Fischer et al., 2019; Schilt et al., 2014), which
corresponds to a ∼0.8 TgNyr−1 increase in total N2O flux within 500 years assuming no change in N2O lifetime
(Figure S3 in Supporting Information S1). The main cause was attributed to the resumption of the Atlantic
meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) during the Preboreal Oscillation (PB) (Henry et al., 2016; Pedro
et al., 2018).
The composite record shows a noticeable decrease of ∼10 ppb during 10.0–8.8 ka corresponding to a decrease of
∼0.5 TgNyr−1 in total N2O flux (Figure S2 in Supporting Information S1), which was followed by a prolonged
N2O minimum between 8.8 and 6.2 ka. Thereafter, the record shows a progressive increase in atmospheric N2O
concentration (∼12 ppb) corresponding to a ∼0.5 TgNyr−1 increase in total N2O flux between 6.2 and 3.0 ka.
Finally, the N2O record shows another maximum at 3.0–2.2 ka, followed by a decrease over the next ∼800 yrs to
attain a minimum at around 1.4 ka. The 1.4 ka local N2O minimum was also reported by a recent N2O study from
Styx, NEEM, and Law Dome ice core sites (MacFarling Meure et al., 2006; Rubino et al., 2019; Ryu et al., 2020).
Subsequently, the pre‐industrial increase of N2O after 1.4 ka might be related to the increased agricultural ac-
tivities (Syakila & Kroeze, 2011; Xu et al., 2017). Overall, the new SPICE record, combined with the existing
records shows new features of N2O variations on millennial time scales during the Holocene.
5. Discussion
The Holocene variation of all the three major greenhouse gases CO2, CH4, and N2O provides interesting in-
formation about the regional climate variation influencing their production and emission from major source areas

(Flückiger et al., 2002). It is estimated that the ocean has been a dominant CO2 source, whereas the terrestrial
regions have been a net carbon sink during the Holocene (Brovkin et al., 2019; Goodwin et al., 2011). On the other
hand, early and middle Holocene changes in atmospheric methane are related to the changes in Northern tropical
wetlands (Yang et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2014), whereas the late Holocene increase in atmospheric CH4 is linked
with the increase in orbitally controlled tropical sources, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere (Beck
et al., 2018; Singarayer et al., 2011). However, the atmospheric N2O variation during the Holocene is attributed to
changes in both land and ocean N2O sources (Flückiger et al., 2002). Our new Holocene N2O composite shows
two distinct N2O maxima around PB (11–10 ka) and 3–2.2 ka, followed by successive minima at 8.8–6.2 ka and
around 1.4 ka, respectively. N2O production and emission in terrestrial environments primarily depend on
temperature and precipitation changes that alter soil texture and moisture content (Liu et al., 2015), microbial
ecology (Zhang et al., 2013), and substrate availability (Bai et al., 2013). In general, increased temperature
and precipitation enhance N2O emissions from soils (Bouwman et al., 2002; Potter et al., 1996). The main
terrestrial N2O source is the Tropical Forest and the precipitation changes during the monsoon season are
suggested to be the important factor which influences the N2O variability in these regions (Stehfest &
Bouwman, 2006; Xu et al., 2017). On the other hand, marine N2O production in oxic waters is dominated by
nitrification (Battaglia & Joos, 2018), whereas the denitrification process dominates surrounding OMZ regions
with a limited contribution from nitrification (Frey et al., 2020; Ji et al., 2015). The highest marine N2O
production and efflux are concentrated around sub‐oxic waters with high productivity (Cohen & Gor-
don, 1978; Suntharalingam et al., 2000). The expansion of hypoxia in the water column during intensified OMZ
causes an increase in marine production and outgassing of N2O (Babbin et al., 2015; Ji et al., 2015; Naqvi
et al., 2000). It is estimated that the majority of marine N2O emissions come from regions where highly productive
waters overlay shallow OMZs, such as the Eastern Tropical South Pacific (ETSP) and the Arabian Sea (AS)
(Arevalo‐Martinez et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2020). Therefore, to investigate further, we compared our N2O
composite with individual paleo‐proxies of tropical precipitation and temperature as well as the marine oxygen
minimum zone to understand the processes that occurred during the Holocene concerning the change in terrestrial
and marine N2O sources, respectively (Figures 4 and 5). Further, we conducted a correlation test by analyzing
correlation coefficients between the N2O composite and the paleo‐proxy records from the vital regions for each
period with the possible lead/lag times (Table 1). To establish correlations on land, we compared the speleothem
records of oxygen isotope (δ18O), which serves as a proxy for past rainfall in major monsoon regions. For marine
correlations, we examined the records of nitrogen isotope ratios (δ15N) in marine sediments, which is a good
indicator of the subsurface denitrification process around oxygen minimum zones. Such correlations are not
necessarily a causal connection throughout the Holocene but may give an idea about the plausible N2O source
during the important periods of N2O variation discussed in this study.
5.1. 11.5–10.0 ka
The composite record shows a significant N2O increase of ∼15 ppb (∼0.8 TgNyr−1) during 11.5–11 ka followed
by an N2O maximum between 11 and 10 ka (Figure 2 & Figure S2 in Supporting Information S1). Looking at the
air temperature record from South China, which is known for its high N2O production, it is evident that there was a
significant increase in temperature between 11.5 and 10.0 ka (Shi et al., 2021) (Figure 4). Following this increase,
there was a decreasing trend after 10 ka. Further, we compared the oxygen isotope (δ18O) record of speleothem (a
proxy for the past monsoon rainfall) from major monsoon regions with our N2O composite. The δ18O signatures
of calcite are controlled by the seepage water in the caves, which preserves the records of past precipitation such
that the increase in precipitation is reflected by a negative excursion in δ18O. The Asian Monsoon speleothem
records from Dongge Cave suggest an intensification of the Asian Monsoon between 11.5 and 10.0 ka, which is
followed by a declining Asian Monsoon trend during the Middle and Late Holocene (Dykoski et al., 2005)
(Figure 4). On the other hand, the monsoon records of other regions show variable patterns during each of the
periods. Furthermore, the correlation test indicates a good correlation of N2O trend with Asian (Dongge Cave), N.
American (Pink Panther), N. African (Soreq Cave) and Indonesian‐Australian Monsoon (Liang Luar Cave) re-
gions (Asmerom et al., 2007; Bar‐Matthews & Ayalon, 2011; Dykoski et al., 2005; Griffiths et al., 2009). These
observations are in agreement with the N2O isotope‐based terrestrial flux (Fland) record of Fischer et al. (2019)
showing ∼0.3 TgNyr−1 increase in terrestrial N2O emission between 11.5 and 10 ka (Figure 4).
Looking at marine records, we compared the N2O composite with the δ15N signatures in marine sediments
from major oxygen minimum zones (ETSP and AS) (Figure 5). The δ15N record from both AS (RC‐27‐23 and

RC‐27‐14) and ETSP (GeoB7139–2 and M772‐03‐2) exhibits enriched values, indicating strong OMZ condi-
tions, which reflect higher N2O emissions from these regions between 11.5 and 10.0 ka (Altabet et al., 2002; De‐
Pol‐Holz et al., 2007; Mollier‐Vogel et al., 2019) (Figure 5). These observations are also reflected in the cor-
relation analysis results showing a highly correlated N2O composite and δ15N of bulk sediment around the Chile
Margin (Site GeoB7139‐2), Peru Margin (Site M772‐03‐02), and AS (Site RC‐27‐23) indicating high N2O
emission from these regions (Table 1). At the same time, the N2O isotope‐based ocean flux (Focean) shows a
notable ∼0.6 TgNyr−1 increase in marine N2O emission (Fischer et al., 2019) (Figure 5). These observations
suggest that the rise in atmospheric N2O concentration between 11.5 and 10.0 ka was caused by the increased
emissions from both terrestrial and marine N2O sources.
5.2. 10.0–6.2 ka
The N2O composite shows a prominent ∼10 ppb (∼0.5 TgNyr−1) decrease between 10.0 and 8.8 ka which was
followed by a prolonged N2O minimum between 8.8 and 6.2 ka. These trends are similar to the early‐mid‐
Holocene decrease in atmospheric CH4, attributed to the decline in Northern and Southern Hemisphere emis-
sions during the early and mid‐Holocene respectively (Beck et al., 2018). During the same period (between 10.0
and 6.2 ka), the Asian and N. African monsoons show insignificant correlation (|r| < 0.3) with the N2O trend
whereas the N. American Monsoon shows a weak correlation (Table 1). On the other hand, the Southern
Hemisphere monsoon shows intensification during the N2O decrease. Looking at the marine records, δ15N‐proxy
records from both the Arabian Sea and ETSP show a contemporaneous decrease by 2–4‰, indicating a large‐
scale weakening of OMZs related to the deepening of oxycline in those regions (Agnihotri et al., 2006; Alta-
bet et al., 2002; De‐Pol‐Holz et al., 2007; Mollier‐Vogel et al., 2019). Such prominent weakening of OMZ be-
tween 10 and 6.2 ka might have reduced the large‐scale production of N2O in the Arabian Sea and ETSP,
significantly contributing to the formation of the N2O minimum between 8.8 and 6.2 ka.
We also compared the individual responses of terrestrial (temperature and precipitation changes) and marine
(denitrification and OMZ changes) proxies from major N2O‐producing regions during 8.8–6.2 ka minimum. For
this purpose, we calculated the average Z‐score of each record for the period between 8.8 and 6.2 ka and the rest of
the Holocene (see Supporting Information S1 for more details on the calculation of the Z‐Scores) (Figures S8‐S12
in Supporting Information S1). The paleo‐proxy record illustrates wet and warm conditions around the Asian
Monsoon region between 8.8 and 6.2 ka (Berkelhammer et al., 2012; Dykoski et al., 2005; Fleitmann et al., 2007;
Hu et al., 2008) (Figure S8 in Supporting Information S1). In contrast, South America experienced dry conditions
during the same period (Bird et al., 2011; Van Breukelen et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007) (Figure 6 and Figure S8
in Supporting Information S1). The average Z‐score of δ15N records from both ETSP and AS indicates the
prolonged weakening of OMZ and reduced N2O production in both regions during 8.8–6.2 ka (Figure S11 in
Supporting Information S1). Hence, the N2O minimum between 8.8 and 6.2 ka mainly correlates with the
prominent decrease in marine N2O production around the upwelling centers. These results corroborate the
findings of Fischer et al. (2019), suggesting a gradual decrease of Focean by ∼1 TgNyr−1, whereas the Fland shows
a secular trend between 10 and 6 ka (Figures 4 and 5). All these observations suggest that the notable decrease in
atmosphere concentration between 10.0 and 6.2 ka is attributed to the significant drop in emission from the marine
N2O sources.
5.3. 6.2–2.2 ka
Between 6.2 and 3.0 ka, the N2O composite shows a progressive increase (∼12 ppb or ∼0.5 TgNyr−1), which is
followed by another N2O maximum at 3.0–2.2 ka. The N2O increase correlates with the intensification of
Southern Hemisphere monsoons (South American and Australian‐Indonesian) whereas the Asian and N. African
monsoons show a weakening trend between 6.2 and 2.2 ka (Tables 1 and 2). The contemporary increase in the pre‐
industrial atmospheric CH4 is also attributed to the increase in the emissions from the Southern Hemisphere (Beck

et al., 2018; Singrayer et al., 2011). In the marine records, the AS and ETSP show a gradual increase in the
denitrification process between 6.2 and 2.2 ka, indicating the intensification of OMZ, promotion of N2O pro-
duction, and outgassing from those regions (Agnihotri et al., 2006; Altabet et al., 2002; Azharuddin et al., 2022;
De‐Pol‐Holz et al., 2007; Mollier‐Vogel et al., 2019). The correlation results also suggest that the N2O trend
during that period corresponds to the intensification in Southern Hemisphere Monsoons and OMZs in AS and
ETSP.

5.4. 2.2–1.4 ka
The N2O record shows a prominent 8 ppb (∼0.3 TgNyr−1) decrease between 2.2 ka and 1.4 ka, leading to an N2O
minimum at around 1.4 ka. During the same period, the Asian and Australian‐Indonesian monsoons show
weakening (Tables 1 and 2). On the other hand, the δ15N of bulk sediment at Peru Margin sites PC‐2 and M772‐03
shows a ∼2‰ decrease indicating the weakened OMZ in the region (Agnihotri et al., 2006; Mollier‐Vogel
et al., 2019). At the same time, both Fland & Focean show a notable decrease in emissions centering around 1.4
ka (Fischer et al., 2019) (Figures 4 and 5). The N2O minimum at 1.4 ka (∼600 CE) was previously reported from
Styx and NEEM ice core sites and was attributed to the changes in tropical hydroclimate and ocean productivity
(Ryu et al., 2020).

6. Conclusions
We present the millennial‐scale N2O variation during the Holocene epoch obtained from the SPICE core. The
results demonstrate agreement with other existing ice core records from Antarctica and Greenland on a millennial
scale. Furthermore, the new high‐resolution record from SPICE shows a centennial‐scale N2O minimum around
2.8 ka which is not observed in other ice core records possibly due to lower sample resolution and/or higher age
smoothing. We prepared a Holocene N2O composite by combining the new SPICE results with the existing N2O
records. Our N2O composite exhibits four distinct periods of N2O variation consisting of two N2O maxima during
11–10 ka and 3.0–2.2 ka, followed by two minima during 8.8–6.2 ka and at around 1.4 ka, respectively. The most
significant N2O increase (∼15 ppb or ∼0.8 TgNyr−1) is observed between 11.5 and 10.0 ka, which corresponds to
the increased precipitation around major monsoon regions and intensified the Arabian Sea and Chile Margin
OMZ. Subsequently, the ∼0.5 TgNyr−1 decrease in N2O flux between 10.0 and 6.2 ka may plausibly be asso-
ciated with the reduced N2O emission owing to aridification in the South American monsoon region and
weakening of the Arabian Sea and ETSP OMZ. Between 6.2 and 2.2 ka, the progressive increase (∼12 ppb or
∼0.5 TgNyr−1) in atmospheric N2O leading to another N2O maximum from 3.0 to 2.2 ka are associated with the
high N2O emissions owing to increased precipitation of Southern Hemisphere monsoons and intensified OMZ
conditions around the ETSP and the Arabian Sea. Another significant N2O decrease at 1.4 ka is attributed to the
decrease in Northern Hemisphere temperature, reduced precipitation in Asian and Indonesian‐Australian
monsoon regions, and weakened OMZ around ETSP. Scenario‐based numerical modeling studies are required
to better understand the relationship between climate and N2O variation during the Holocene. In addition, the
high‐resolution study of N2O isotopologues (δ15N, δ18O, and site preference of N2O molecules) focusing on the
Holocene epoch may further help resolve the individual contribution of marine and terrestrial sources and their
variation during N2O maxima and minima.
