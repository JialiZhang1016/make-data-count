Abstract
A new generation of vaccines for the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) have now ad-
vanced into clinical development, with the Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel Hookworm Vaccine
already being tested in Phase 1 studies in healthy adults. The current manuscript focuses
on the often overlooked critical aspects of NTD vaccine product development, more specifi-
cally, vaccine stability testing programs. A key measure of vaccine stability testing is "rela-
tive potency" or the immunogenicity of the vaccine during storage. As with most NTD
vaccines, the Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel Hookworm Vaccine was not developed by attenuation
or inactivation of the pathogen (Necator americanus), so conventional methods for measur-
ing relative potency are not relevant for this investigational product. Herein, we describe a
novel relative potency testing program and report for the first time on the clinical lot of this
NTD vaccine during its first 60 months of storage at 2–8˚C. We also describe the develop-
ment of a complementary functional assay that measures the ability of IgG from animals
or humans immunized with Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel to neutralize this important hookworm
enzyme. While 90% inhibition of the catalytic activity of Na-GST-1 was achieved in animals
immunized with Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel, lower levels of inhibition were observed in immu-
nized humans. Moreover, anti-Na-GST-1 antibodies from volunteers in non-hookworm
endemic areas were better able to inhibit catalytic activity than anti-Na-GST-1 antibodies
from volunteers resident in hookworm endemic areas. The results described herein provide
the critical tools for the product development of NTD vaccines.

Author summary
As vaccines targeting NTDs advance into clinical trials, product development and vaccine
maintenance become critical activities for the success of these vaccines. A key activity dur-
ing this phase of vaccine development is the “relative potency” of a vaccine or the quality
of the immune response that the vaccine elicits in an animal model during storage to
ensure its immunogenicity is maintained. As with most NTD vaccines, the Na-GST-1/
Alhydrogel Hookworm Vaccine was not developed using traditional methods of attenuat-
ing the pathogen (Necator americanus), so traditional measures of relative potency, such
as testing the vaccine’s ability to protect against lethal challenge, could not be used. For
the first time, we describe the development of a relative potency testing program for an
NTD vaccine during five years of storage at 2–8˚C. We also describe the development of a
complementary functional assay that measures the ability of IgG from animals or humans
immunized with Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel to neutralize this important hookworm enzyme.
The results described herein provide, for the first time in an open access format, critical
tools for the development of future NTD vaccines.
Introduction
Over the next decade, a new generation of vaccines for the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs),
especially those for helminthic parasites such schistosomiasis and hookworm (Necator ameri-
canus) will advance into clinical trials [1]. The Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel Hookworm Vaccine has
already entered into the initial stages of clinical development. As with other experimental vac-
cines for tropical diseases, including recombinant vaccines for Plasmodium falciparum malaria
[2, 3], the Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel Human Hookworm Vaccine was not developed using the
conventional methods of attenuation or inactivation of the pathogen that induce sterilizing
immunity in the host [1]. The aim of the Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel Hookworm Vaccine is to
induce neutralizing antibodies that will interfere with the role of glutathione S-transferase-1
(GST-1) in heme detoxification following blood digestion [4–6], inducing parasite death or
reducing worm fecundity, thereby reducing protracted morbidity in the host [1, 7–10]. Con-
ventional vaccine potency testing is often characterized by defining the doses of the vaccine
that reproducibly protect immunized animals against lethal challenge from a pathogen and is
in use for a number of vaccines, including those for tetanus, rabies, diphtheria, pertussis, and
clostridia [11–14]. However, conventional vaccine potency testing programs are not feasible
for the Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel Hookworm Vaccine due to the following characteristics of
hookworms: (i) pathogenesis that results in chronic debilitating morbidity and not lethality,
(ii) clinical outcomes that take years (sometimes even decades) to manifest in human hosts,
and (iii) vaccine outcomes that are nearly impossible to replicate in laboratory animal models
such as iron deficiency anemia from chronic hookworm infection as the animals become
“refractory” to long-term infection [1, 15]. The vaccine potency testing program presented
here is based on the levels of antibodies detected in the sera of animals immunized with
defined doses of Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel [15]. Herein, we describe assessing the potency of the
Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel Hookworm Vaccine formulation immediately after its manufacture
(“potency at lot release”) and then its stability during 60 months of storage at 2–8˚C (“relative
potency”). This vaccine potency assay program can serve as a model for the expanding NTD
vaccine community and aid in the product and clinical development of the next generation of
recombinant NTD vaccines.

Material and methods
Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel hookworm vaccine
Necator americanus glutathione-S-transferase-1 (Na-GST-1) is a 24-kDa recombinant protein
from N. americanus expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified by three chromatographic steps
[16]. The Na-GST-1 Clinical Drug Product (Aeras Lot# 09-69F-001) was formulated at a con-
centration of 0.1 mg/mL Na-GST-1 with 0.8 mg/mL of Alhydrogel in a glucose/imidazole
buffer (10% dextrose, 10mM imidazole, pH 7.4). The drug product (vaccine) was produced
according to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) on November 17th, 2010 (Aeras,
Rockville, MD) and thereafter stored in temperature monitored refrigerators at 2–8˚C.
Bioassay
Vivarium: Seven to eight-week-old BALB/c mice were obtained from Taconic (Gaithersburg,
MD). Mice were housed in a Bio-safety level-2 animal facility with a room temperature of
72 ± 4˚F under negative air pressure and with the air changed every 15–18 hours. A 12-hour
day and dark light cycle was maintained in the animal facilities and the mice fed with Teklad
Rodent Diet #2018. Mice were identified by ear puncture, and housed five animals per cage.
Mice were acclimated to housing conditions one week prior to the start of the study. Mice
were observed following immunizations for any signs of ill health (e.g., hunched, scruffy
appearance, etc.). The animal studies reported herein were conducted at The George Washing-
ton University (Washington, DC), with the approval of its Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (Protocol A042) and at the Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, TX) in compli-
ance with its Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol AN-5765).
Study Design: Fig 1 shows the bioassay used for the determination of potency immediately
after manufacturing (lot release) and relative potency over 60 months. The pilot dose-ranging
study (Fig 1A) utilized research grade recombinant Na-GST-1, and was performed prior to
release of the clinical lot. The pilot dose-ranging study and subsequent release study consisted
of two immunization cohorts (Fig 1A,B): Cohort 1 was immunized using a prime-only regi-
men with a terminal bleed on Study Day 28; Cohort 2, was immunized with a prime-boost reg-
imen (Day 0 and Day 28) followed by a terminal bleed on Study Day 42. The study designs
used for determination of relative potency over the 60-month stability period are shown in Fig
1B and 1C.
Mice Immunizations: BALB/c mice were divided into ten dose groups of ten mice each.
BALB/c mice in Group 1 were immunized with Alhydrogel alone; BALB/c mice in Group 2
were immunized with Na-GST-1 alone; and BALB mice in Groups 3 to 9 were immunized in
1.75-fold increasing fractional doses of the vaccine starting from 1 μg to 30 μg of Na-GST-1,
with the ratio of the dose of Na-GST-1 to Alhydrogel constant at 0.125 (Table 1). Study Group
10 (6 μg of formulated reference standard Na-GST-1) was included as an in-house reference
control (lot# 082709APM) (Table 1). All immunizations were administered by the intraperito-
neal route. Fractional dosing generated the doses: i.e., a volume containing the exact amount
of Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel drug product was withdrawn into the syringe as opposed to diluting
the vaccine to achieve these doses.
Murine IgG against Na-GST-1 measured by a qualified indirect ELISA
A qualified indirect ELISA described by Jariwala et al [15] and Bethony et al [17, 18] was used
to measure levels of IgG against Na-GST-1 in murine serum samples. Ninety-six-well Polysorp
microtiter plates (NUNC) were coated with 1 μg/mL of recombinant Na-GST-1 onto which
experimental mouse sera were also added. Colorimetric reactions were read at a wavelength of

Na-GST-1/80μg Alhydrogel co-administered with 5μg CpG 10104 delivered intramuscularly
(IM). A negative control (NC) pool was similarly prepared using ten BALB/c mice immunized
IM with 80μg Alhydrogel only. The SRS was serially diluted in duplicate along 11 columns of
the first two rows of each ELISA plate to generate a dilution–response curve modeled into a
SCC by a four-parameter logistic-log function as described by Jariwala et al [15]. The linearity
and parallelism of the SCCs were assessed as part of the qualification of the SRS, with the SCCs
linearized through a transformation and an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test [15]. The
Arbitrary Units (AU) of anti-Na-GST-1 IgG were obtained as described by us in Jariwala et al
[15]. Indirect ELISAs for these studies were performed at eight different time points post
release of the new vaccine lot, with a global SCC (GSCC) established at each time point (Fig 2).
The GSCC is assembled from the individual SCCs from each plate in the experimental run (as
described in Jariwala et al [15] and Quinn et al [19]). Briefly, all the individual SCC in an
experimental run are fit to a single sigmoidal shaped 4-PL function that estimates the com-
bined parameters into a GSCC. The GSCC is then used to interpolate the levels of IgG against
Na-GST-1 and to determine the numbers of seroconverted animals to elucidate the ED50 of
the drug product at each time point.
Determination of a Reactivity Threshold (RT), the median Effective Dose
(ED50), potency at release, and Relative Potency (RP)
The value of the Reactivity Threshold (RT) was obtained from the GSCC as discussed by us in
detail in Jariwala et al [15] (Table 1). The probit function of SAS 9.2 was used to estimate the
ED50 with its 95% Fiducial Limits (95% FLs) as also described in [15] from the number of sero-
positive animals in each vaccination group. Based upon this model, the specification (as
required by the Investigation New Drug [IND] application to the United States Food and
Drug Administration (US-FDA)) for potency testing at release of the newly manufactured lot
of Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel clinical drug product was set as the elicitation of an ED50 with 95%
FLs from Na-GST-1 absorbed to Alhydrogel immunized into nine groups of ten BALB/c mice
with doses ranging from 1 to 30 μg of Na-GST-1.

The relative potency (RP) of the clinical vaccine lot was estimated at eight post-release time
points by the ED50 and 95% FLs, which made it possible to estimate an RP at each of these
time points post release to determine the stability of the vaccine [20]. Subsequent to this evalu-
ation, the RP and its 95% FLs are estimated by regressing the dose-response curves and then
dividing by their common slope. The RP is calculated by comparing the ED50 at each post
manufacture stability testing time point to the ED50 at release (T = 0 months) by the following
expression:

Desorption of Na-GST-1 from Alhydrogel
Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel was treated with a sodium citrate buffer to desorb the recombinant pro-
tein from Alhydrogel. In brief, a solution of 100 mM sodium citrate, 92 mM dibasic sodium
phosphate, pH 8.9 (unadjusted) was prepared and sterile filtered. The desorption buffer was
then mixed with the re-suspended formulation at a ratio of 2:1 (buffer: vaccine), inverted ten
times, and incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature (mixing by inversion every 20 min-
utes). The mixture was then centrifuged at 2,000 g for two minutes and supernatant (desorbed
protein solution) or pellet (Alhydrogel) mixed with 2X sample buffer and analyzed via SDS-
PAGE. Methodology for determining vaccine identity and integrity by SDS-PAGE including
densitometry are reported in Plieskatt et al [22]. Pre-cast 4–20% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen)
were utilized for electrophoresis under reduced (DTT) and non-reduced conditions, followed
by Coomassie staining utilizing Phastgel Blue R (GE Healthcare) or silver staining [22]. Densi-
tometry was completed using a GS-800 calibrated densitometer (Bio-Rad) with Quantity One
(Bio-Rad) Software for analysis.
Fractionation of IgG from sera of animals and humans immunized with
Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel
Mouse serum samples obtained from dose-ranging studies of Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel were
used to optimize the assay. In brief, IgG were fractionated from Study Day 42 sera of mice
immunized with fractional doses of approximately 6, 10, 17, and 30 μg in a prime-boost
regimen. Human plasma samples were utilized from two separate Phase 1 studies of the safety
and immunogenicity of Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel in non-endemic areas (Washington, DC
[NCT01385189] and Belo Horizonte, Brazil [NCT01261130]) and from a N. americanus
endemic area in Minas Gerais state, Brazil (NCT01261130). In each trial, subjects were vacci-
nated on Study Days 0, 56, and 112, with blood collected on Study Day 126 (i.e., two weeks
after the third vaccination) for the primary assessment of immunogenicity. Plasma collected
prior to prime immunization (Study Day 0) and two weeks after the third immunization
(Study Day 126) were IgG fractionated for the purposes of the neutralization assay described
below. In the United States Phase 1 trial, 34 of 40 enrolled subjects completed the Study Day
126 visit, whereas in the Brazil trial, 96 of 102 enrolled subjects did.
IgG fractions from human plasma and mouse serum samples were purified by Protein G
Spin Plates (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In brief, Protein G
Spin Plates were equilibrated to room temperature and equilibrated with Binding Buffer (0.1M
sodium phosphate, 0.15M sodium chloride, pH 7.2). All sera or plasma samples were diluted
1:1 in Binding Buffer, added to the wells of the spin plates, and the spin plates agitated on a
plate shaker for 30 minutes at RT. Protein G Spin Plates were centrifuged with collection plates

to remove the flow-through. Four wash steps consisted of the addition of binding buffer to
each well followed by centrifugation of the spin plates with collection plates. To elute the total
IgG from sera or plasma sample, 0.1M glycine pH 2.0 was added to each well followed by agita-
tion on a plate shaker for one minute. The spin plates were centrifuged to collect the elution
into collection plates already containing 1M Tris pH 9.0 to neutralize the pH of the eluate.
Purified IgG was stored at 2–8˚C until analysis within seven days.
The Na-GST-1 neutralization assay
A schematic of the neutralization assay is shown in Supplementary S1 Fig. In brief, neutraliza-
tion of Na-GST-1 activity by purified IgG from mice or humans immunized with Na-GST-1/
Alhydrogel was measured utilizing the GST Fluorometric Activity Assay Kit (BioVision). To
assay the purified human IgG, the manufacturer’s protocol was followed with modifications to
sample volumes and as further noted here. In a 96-well black plate (Thermo Scientific), dupli-
cate sample wells were prepared with a total volume of 100 μl, consisting of 90 μl of Na-GST-1
(0.25 μg) diluted in GST Assay Buffer and 10 μl of purified IgG. Blank wells contained 100 μl
of GST Assay Buffer alone. Additional control wells (total volume of 100 μl) contained GST
alone or IgG and were measured in quadruplicate. Plates were incubated at 37˚C for one hour
with agitation. After incubation, 10 μl of Glutathione was added to each well. To initiate the
reaction, monochlorobimane solution was diluted 1:50 in GST Assay Buffer and 100 μl was
added to each well. The plate was placed in the SpectraMax Paradigm Multimode Plate Reader
(Molecular Devices), shaken for one second, and then fluorescence measured at Ex/EM 380
nm/460 nm every five minutes for one hour. The measurement of Relative Fluorescence Units
(RFUs) at 15 minutes was used for analysis. Purified mouse IgG was assayed in the same man-
ner except for an experiment where the volume of purified IgG was varied at 1, 5, 10, and
20 μl.
Western blots for Na-GST-1 specific IgG using sera of animals and
plasma of humans immunized with Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel
To confirm the presence of Na-GST-1 specific IgG in the purified mouse and human IgG sam-
ples, Western Blots were performed. Five micrograms of reduced and non-reduced recombi-
nant Na-GST-1 were diluted in Sample Buffer (Life Technologies) and heated at 95˚C for five
minutes and loaded on 4–20% Tris-glycine gels (Life Technologies) with See Blue Plus2 stan-
dard (Life Technologies). For reduced Na-GST-1 samples, β-mercaptoethanol was included in
the sample preparation. The gels were run in SDS running buffer (Life Technologies) at 135V
for 90 minutes using the PowerEase 500 Power Supply and XCell SureLock Mini-Cell system
(Invitrogen). Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Life Technologies) in Trans-
fer Buffer (Life Technologies) at 30V for 60 minutes using the PowerEase 500 Power Supply
and XCell II Blot Module (Life Technologies) and stained with Ponceau S (Sigma-Aldrich) to
confirm transfer of the protein occurred.
Anti-Na-GST-1 IgG (mouse).
Blocking, primary antibody incubation, washes, secondary
antibody incubation, and developing were performed with the WesternBreeze Chromogenic
Immunodetection System (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The
purified mouse IgG (primary antibody) was diluted 1:200 in supplied buffer.
Anti-Na-GST-1 IgG (human).
Following Ponceau S staining, membranes were blocked
in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20(PBS-T) and 3% skim milk powder for 1 hour (room temperature)
or overnight (2–8˚C). Membranes were then incubated with purified human IgG diluted 1:200
in blocking buffer for 45 minutes with gentle shaking at room temperature. Following three
washes with PBS-T, the membranes were then incubated with the secondary antibody anti-

Modeling the standard calibration curve and determining its linearity and
a reactivity threshold
Following pilot potency assay development as described in by us in [15] and further outlined
in the bioassay study design (Fig 1), the reactivity threshold (RT) was determined for each
time point during the 60 months of stability testing. Fig 2A shows the sigmoidal 4-parameter
logistic log (4-PL) function of the SCC for the potency studies of Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel as
described previously by us [15]. The parallelism of the linearized SCCs (N = 9), along with the
p-values from the ANOVA test are shown in Fig 2B and Fig 3, with the ANOVA test showing
no significant deviation from parallelism for the nine SCCs except at the six-month time point

acceptance was that the upper 95% Fiducial Limit of the RP should not be less than 0.50.

Determination of the ED50 using a probit model
The number of responders by dose group is shown in Table 1, which includes results from
potency testing at lot release and at nine subsequent time points post-release (60 months). The
ED50 at lot release was 15.74 μg (95% FL = 11.74, 23.36) from which the RP specification for
the manufactured lot of Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel was established for subsequent stability testing
time points. The specification for potency in the Investigational New Drug (IND) application
to the US Food and Drug Administration for Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel requires that the upper
95% FL of the RP value remains above 0.50 (Fig 3): i.e., a point that describes a vaccine potency
that is half of the potency at the time of release. In other words, if the value of the upper 95%
FL falls below the value of 0.50, the vaccine lot of Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel is considered to have
“lost” its potency, which means that this lot of vaccine could no longer be used in clinical trials
with human volunteers. However, increased potency was observed after three months of stor-
age post-manufacture, with the RP 3.19-times higher than the value obtained at lot release (Fig
3). At subsequent testing time points, the RP remained stable at this value over the remaining
60 months of potency testing (Table 2, Fig 3).
Decrease in desorption efficiency of Na-GST-1 from Alhydrogel post
manufacture coincides with a gain in relative potency
The change in relative potency during the first three months post manufacture of Na-GST-1 to
Alhydrogel could be attributed to the increased affinity of Na-GST-1 to Alhydrogel during the
first three months of the storage as shown represented in Fig 4, which demonstrates the rela-
tionship between the RP and the percentage of protein remaining bound to Alhydrogel after
desorption conducted at the same time points.
The Na-GST-1 vaccine was formulated as a suspension of 0.1 mg/mL Na-GST-1 and 0.8
mg/mL Alhydrogel and was optimized in a glucose/imidazole buffer to permit 100% absorp-
tion of the recombinant protein to Alhydrogel as well as to enhance stability over time [22].
The clinical lot of Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel met other biochemical specifications at release,
including 100% absorption to Alhydrogel, identity as Na-GST-1, and purity by SDS-PAGE
[16]. Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel demonstrated biochemical stability as indicated by this series of

stability assays conducted over time, including identity and purity, and remained consistently
absorbed to Alhydrogel [16]. In addition to this routine stability testing, the cGMP lot of Na-
GST-1/Alhydrogel vaccine was subjected to testing including isoelectric focusing (deamida-
tion) and antigen desorption, with no changes observed in the isoelectric point (which would
indicate deamidation) with these data shown in [22]. A sodium citrate buffer (pH 8.9) was uti-
lized to desorb the recombinant protein Na-GST-1 from its adjuvant Alhydrogel. The effi-
ciency of this desorption (i.e., the ability to desorb Na-GST-1 from Alhydrogel) as measured
by SDS-PAGE and densitometry, decreased over the first nine months post manufacture but
stabilized thereafter (Fig 4). When plotting the RP of Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel versus the desorp-
tion efficiency of Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel (Fig 4), this association is clearly apparent.
Western blotting for IgG against Na-GST-1 from mice and humans
immunized with Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel
Antibodies (IgG) purified from both mouse sera and human plasma were confirmed to be
reactive to the recombinant antigen Na-GST-1. Western blots (Fig 5) performed on sera from
a selection of BALB/c mice immunized with Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel and from a selection of

Potency (RP) through 18 months post manufacture. At time t = 0, Na-GST-1 could be completely removed from the Alhydrogel following
treatment with sodium citrate. A gain in potency as represented by an increase in RP occurred during the initial three months post manufacture of
lot #09-69F-001 of Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel. Also, the ability to desorb the Na-GST-1 from Alhydrogel decreased with time and plateaued by nine
months post manufacture. A one-phase exponential decay model is used to graphically represent this shift. Left Y-axis: Percentage Na-GST-1

human plasma from a Phase 1 clinical trial of Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel in Brazilian adults con-
firmed the presence of IgG against Na-GST-1 in these purified samples (Fig 5). Specifically,
these purified IgG samples recognized both non-reduced and reduced Na-GST-1 at approxi-
mately 24 kilo Daltons (kDa). It should be noted that Na-GST-1 under non-reduced condi-
tions appears as a doublet as previously reported [16, 22].
Inhibition of catalytic activity of Na-GST-1 by IgG from mice immunized
with Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel
Having demonstrated the ability to purify IgG from mouse sera and the positive reactivity of
such sera with recombinant Na-GST-1, we employed analysis with a fluorescence-based assay
to measure possible inhibition of such antibodies to Na-GST-1 catalytic activity. It should be
noted that this assay measured Glutathione-S-Transferase activity, and therefore is only repre-
sentative of Na-GST-1 activity; inhibition through this assay is not necessarily indicative of the
mechanism of native Na-GST-1 in N. americanus, which is thought to be detoxification of free
heme that is the end product of the worm’s hemoglobin digestion pathway [4]. This shows that
immunization with Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel can elicit antibodies that block the recombinant
protein’s catalytic activity.
First, the non-specific activity present in IgG purified from mouse sera was measured. A
commercial mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch), which is presumably non-reactive to
GST, did not inhibit Na-GST-1 glutathione-S-transferase activity (Fig 6, Panel A). To deter-
mine if IgG purified from mice immunized with Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel showed a dose-depen-
dent inhibition of Na-GST-1 glutathione-S-transferase activity, sera from mice immunized
with increasing doses of Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel (Fig 6 Panel B) were assayed. With increasing
doses of Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel, a concomitant increase in the percent of Na-GST-1 inhibited

was observed (Fig 6 Panel B); specifically, sera pooled from mice immunized with doses of

Na-GST-1 glutathione-S-transferase activity by 0, 1, 9, and 22%, respectively, utilizing a consis-
tent volume of IgG (10 μL). To determine the impact of various volumes of IgG and if a “dose
response” (volume) could be observed, a purified IgG pool of sera from mice immunized with
30 μg of Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel was added to the reaction. In this case, inhibition of Na-GST-1
was 0, 13, 22, and 56% when 1, 5, 10, and 20 μl of this pool were added (Fig 6, Panel C). Finally,

the reproducibility of the assay and the effect of different volumes of this reference pool,10 μl
of the purified IgG pool inhibited Na-GST-1 activity by 24 ± 4% and 20 μl of the purified IgG
pool inhibited activity by 52 ± 3%.
Inhibition of the catalytic activity of Na-GST-1 by purified IgG from
humans immunized with Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel hookworm vaccine
After demonstrating successful inhibition of Na-GST-1 in our enzymatic assay with sera
derived from immunized mice, we sought to demonstrate the same inhibitory capability with
human plasma samples obtained from Phase 1 trials of Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel conducted in
the US and Brazil. As human plasma contains components capable of non-specific inhibition
of Na-GST-1 and interferes in the fluorescence-based enzymatic assay. IgG was fractionated
from human plasma and used alongside a commercially available purified human IgG as a
control, as neither induced non-specific inhibition of Na-GST-1.
The percent inhibition of Na-GST-1 glutathione-S-transferase activity was significantly
greater when incubated with IgG purified from the plasma of humans immunized with Na-
GST-1/Alhydrogel (any dose) at Study Day 126 (2 weeks after the third immunization) than
when incubated with IgG purified from the plasma of humans at Study Day 0 (prior to immu-
nization) (p-value = 0.0002) (Fig 7, Panel A) or with study controls (p-value = 0.0002). Of the
130 individuals with plasma samples at Study Day 126, only 6 samples from the United States
trial and 8 samples from Brazilian yielded purified IgG capable of 20% or greater inhibition of
Na-GST-1. The relationship between percent inhibition of Na-GST-1 glutathione-S-transfer-
ase activity and the dose of Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel administered to individuals is shown in Fig
7, Panel B. In most cases, individuals immunized with Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel had higher inhi-
bition of Na-GST-1 glutathione-S-transferase activity than individuals who received the hepa-
titis B comparator vaccine (ButaNG, Instituto Butantan, São Paulo, Brazil) (Fig 7, Panel B).
However, the dose of Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel or the co-administration of Na-GST-1/Alhydro-
gel with an aqueous formulation of the immunostimulant Glucopyranosyl-Lipid A (GLA-AF)
were not found to be factors in the inhibition of the catalytic activity of Na-GST-1 by purified
IgG from human plasma. On the other hand, purified IgG from plasma of individuals resident
in hookworm non-endemic areas (USA and Belo Horizonte, Brazil) was significantly higher
than the inhibition of Na-GST-1 glutathione-S-transferase activity compared to individuals
from a hookworm endemic area in Brazil (Fig 7, Panels C and D) (p = 0.0096) and had signifi-
cantly greater increases in inhibition from Day 0 to Day 126 (p < 0.0001).
Discussion
The current manuscript focuses on a novel vaccine potency program for the Na-GST-1/Alhy-
drogel Hookworm Vaccine, with ramifications for the development of other NTD vaccines. In
contrast to conventional vaccine potency testing programs, our program is unique in that if
the vaccine antigen is presented to an animal immune system in a consistent form and quan-
tity, it will induce a reproducible level of antibody responses to indicate potency at lot release
(immediately cGMP post-manufacture) and then relative potency at pre-determined time

points post-manufacture [11–14]. We also describe the development of a functional assay that
measures the ability of IgG antibodies elicited by immunization with Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel to
impair the catalytic activity of Na-GST-1 as part of the potency testing program, with the
potential for it to be developed into a correlate of protection (CoP) as the vaccine advances
through clinical development [23].
The first cGMP-manufactured lot of the Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel Hookworm Vaccine was
determined to be “potent” immediately after manufacture (i.e., lot release) and remained
potent over 60 months of storage at 2–8˚C. A notable increase in relative potency was observed

over the first nine months post release. A factor often implicated in increased vaccine potency
immediately after manufacture is the vaccine’s formulation: i.e., a change in the interaction
between the protein and the adjuvant. This change may be due to a number of factors, includ-
ing the auto-extraction of impurities or enhanced binding of the recombinant protein to the
adjuvant, resulting in conformational changes to the antigen such as aggregation or deamida-
tion. While no concomitant aggregation or deamidation of the protein was observed three-
months post-manufacture, we did observe increased binding of Na-GST-1 to Alhydrogel, as
evidenced by the inability to remove the antigen from Alhydrogel through standard de-absorp-
tion procedures proximal to this potency time point. The increased binding may have resulted
in the exposure of more immunogenic epitopes on the surface of the formulation, making the
vaccine more potent in the animals. This coincidence of immunological and biochemical mea-
sures illustrates the importance of combining such assays when measuring the stability of
recombinant proteins absorbed to Alhydrogel.
Our immunogenicity-based potency assay program was complemented with an assay that
attempted to parallel one potential mechanism for the Na-GST-1 Human Hookworm Vaccine
in humans [23–25]. Na-GST-1 has peroxidase activity as it catalyzes the conjugation of
reduced glutathione to a variety of electrophiles [4–6]. As such, we designed a functional assay
(S1 Fig) to measure the percent inhibition of Na-GST-1 glutathione-S-transferase activity
when the enzyme is incubated with purified IgG from immunized animals or humans. In
pools of sera from mice immunized with increasing doses of Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel,, we
observed a dose-dependent impairment of Na-GST-1 glutathione-S-transferase activity.
Moreover, an increase in the inhibition of glutathione-S-transferase activity was also observed
when the volume of purified IgG from mice was increased. A limitation of this catalytic inhibi-
tion assay is that it does not directly measure the effect of neutralizing antibodies on the puta-
tive heme detoxification role of Na-GST-1 in N. americanus worms. Nor does it take into
account the potential effects of GSTs as immunomodulators, as shown for example by the
extracellular GST from Onchocerca volvulus (OvGST1), which is thought to participate in the
modulation of host immune responses by production of parasite-derived prostanoids that
downregulate the effector response [26]. In general, plasma from study participants two weeks
after the third immunization with the Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel Hookworm Vaccine showed a
significantly higher inhibition of Na-GST-1 catalytic activity compared to baseline regardless
of the vaccine dose or co-administration with the immunostimulant GLA-AF. However, few
human samples (n = 20) produced greater than 20% inhibition of Na-GST-1 glutathione-S-
transferase activity. This low response rate in humans indicates the need for further advances
in vaccine formulation, immunization regimen, and possibly the co-administration with
another immunostimulant.
Several components of the current potency assay are especially applicable to NTD vaccine
production, principal among them being the choice of an animal model and the statistical
methods used to measure relative potency [11, 14, 15]. Conventional potency assays use animal
models based upon “their permissiveness to lethal infection with the target pathogen” [13].
However, the Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel potency assay measured an antibody response by dose
group; hence, the choice of an animal model was not limited to models permissive to hook-
worm infection such as hamsters or canines [1, 27], neither of which maintain the infection
long enough to measure the clinical endpoints of human hookworm disease (e.g., iron defi-
ciency anemia) for which the vaccine will be indicated. Instead, we chose an animal model
(i.e., BALB/c mice) based on the ability to induce a reproducible antibody response [15, 28].
Another critical choice was the immunization schedule (0 and 28 days), which depended on
several factors, including the animal model, the route of immunization (IP), and the volume of
the immunization [15]).

A final novel component to this assay was the statistical approach to determine potency and
relative potency. The Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel potency testing program varied traditional
potency assays by utilizing a ‘quantal’ assay design [2, 14, 29], which contrasts with conven-
tional “quantitative” immunogenicity methods that use ‘measures of central tendency’ to char-
acterize potency such as the mean, median, and standard deviation of an antibody response
[11]. As noted by Giersing et al. [2] for potency testing of recombinant malaria vaccines, quan-
titative potency approaches have the advantage of producing readily analyzable data, but their
utility is offset by the poor precision of measures of central tendency due to the a high degree of
variation in ELISA assays.
Finally, by modifying a commercially available enzymatic assay into a functional assay for
this vaccine, we were able to demonstrate that antibodies raised to Na-GST-1 may also have a
functional application. However, further work is needed to optimize such this functional assay
before it can become either a part of the current potency testing program or as a correlates of
protection in the future.
