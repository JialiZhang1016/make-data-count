Abstract 
Low-flow anaesthesia is considered beneficial for the patient and the 
environment, and it is cost reducing due to reduced anaesthetic gas 
consumption. An initial high-flow to saturate the circle system (wash-in
) is desirable from a clinical point of view. We measured the wash-in 
and wash-out times (time to saturate and to eliminate the anaesthetic 
agent, AA), for sevoflurane and desflurane, in a test-lung with fixed 3 
MAC vaporizer setting at different fresh gas flow (FGF) and calculated 
the consumption of AA. We tried to find an optimal flow rate for speed 
and gas consumption, comparing two anaesthesia machines (AMs): 
Aisys and Flow-i. Time to reach 1 minimal alveolar concentration 
(MAC) (wash-in) decreased (p<0.05) at higher flow rates (1 – 2 – 4) but 
plateaued at 4-4.8 l/min. The consumption of AA was at its lowest 
around 4-4.8 l/min (optimal flow) for all but the Aisys /desflurane 
group. Wash-out times decreased as FGF increased, until reaching 
plateau at FGF of 4-6 l/min. Aisys had generally shorter wash-in times 
at flow rates < 4 l/min as well as lower consumption of AA. At higher 
flow rates there were little difference between the AMs. The “optimal 
FGF” for wash-out, elimination of gas from the test-lung and circle 
system, plateaued with no increase in speed beyond 6 l/min. A fresh 
gas flow of 4 l/min. seems “optimal” taking speed to reach a 1 MAC ET 
and gas consumption into account during wash-in with a fixed 3 MAC 
vaporizer setting, and increasing fresh gas flow beyond 6 l/min does 
not seem to confirm major benefit during wash-out

Introduction
Low flow anaesthesia is associated with several benefits, reduc-
ing the heat loss caused by cold gases and improving humidifica-
tion in the airways1. It is also environmentally friendly, reducing 
the release of anaesthetic agents into the atmosphere, and lastly, 
it also reduces costs. The initial period needed to achieve a steady 
state is dependent on fresh gas flow and the vaporizer setting2. 
Many different FGF schemes have been described for the 
wash-in3,4. The wash-out of the inhaled anaesthetic from the lungs 
and circle is also of importance, to facilitate a rapid awakening 
and recommencement of protective reflexes.
The aim of the present study was to measure the time required to 
reach stable end tidal 1 MAC anaesthetic (wash-in), to measure gas 
consumption during wash-in and the time needed to eliminate the 
anaesthetic agent (wash-out) for sevoflurane and desflurane, and 
to compare the impact of different fresh gas flows and anaesthesia 
machines.
Methods
This study used a test-lung setup. It was conducted in the operating 
room with proper scavenging equipment and central gas supply at 
Danderyds hospital, Sweden.
Two standard anaesthesia machines were used: Flow-iR (Maquet 
Critical Care AB, Solna, Sweden) and AisysR (GE Healthcare, 
Madison, WI, USA), and two anaesthetic agents: sevoflurane and 
desflurane, making up a total of four test groups. All standard 
safety measures were followed, including checking each machine 
for performance and leakage before every session, in accord-
ance with the Instruction for use (IFU), to ensure a safe working 
environment.
A standard disposable adult circle system was used (GE patient 
circuit, adult, disposable, 1.8 m and 1.5 litre volume), including 
a Y-piece at the end of the tube. A humidity-filter (Humid-vent, 
filter compact A) was fitted on the Y-piece. The circle system also 
included a standard CO2 absorber (soda lime canister) even though 
no carbon dioxide was used in the experiments, because some of the 
anaesthetic agent (AA) may also be absorbed and therefore mimic 
clinical conditions better.
A test lung was assembled using the following equipment: The 
Maquet test-lung 190 (Maquet Critical Care AB, Solna, Sweden), 
tidal volume max 1 litre and internal volume of 0, was mounted 
on one of the tubes of another Y-piece. Two 2-liter Intersurgical 
reservoir bags were connected to a T-tube to the other tube of the 
Y-piece.
Measurements of FiAA and EtAA of sevoflurane and desflurane 
were done with a mainstream sensor (instead of the AM side- 
stream sensors). IRMA AX +, (Masimo Sweden AB, Danderyd, 
Sweden) with an accuracy of 0.15 vol. % was used. This allowed 
us to get more exact measurements without any delay or dilution 
of gases. The mainstream sensor was connected to an external 
computer via a USB port and the Gasmaster® (Masimo 
Sweden AB, Danderyd, Sweden) program was used to record our 
measurements.
During the entire experiment a fixed respiratory rate and tidal vol-
ume was used, set at 12/min and 400 ml respectively. The posi-
tive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was set at 5 cm H2O and the 
inspiratory/expiratory rate was set two 1:2.
Two direct injection vaporizers were used for the Flow-i (one for 
each AA) and two variable bypass vaporizers for the Aisys (one 
for each AA). The AAs were released at fixed vaporizer settings 
of 3 × MAC-value (6 % and 18 % for sevoflurane and desflurane 
respectively).
Wash-in
The timer/data log was started at the same time as when the 
vaporizer was turned on. The wash-in time to reach 1 MAC (i.e. 
increasing the EtAA concentration from 0 to 1 MAC), adjusted 
for a 40-year-old, 70 kg male (2 % for sevoflurane and 6 % 
for desflurane), was measured three consecutive times for each 
fresh gas flow (FGF). The FGF tested included 1, 2, 4, 4.75, 4.8, 
6 and 8 l/min, with a composition of 80 % oxygen and 20 % air 
for each of the AAs and anaesthesia machines.
Wash-out
Wash-out (reducing EtAA to 0 MAC) was performed after each 
wash-in session of the test-lung/circle. This was done by turning 
off the vaporizer and setting the FGF to one of 5 (2, 4, 6, 8 and 
10 l/min) on each anaesthesia machine (AM) and AA.
The same protocol was used for sevoflurane and desflurane as well 
as for Flow-i and Aisys and the results for each wash-in session 
were presented as a mean of 3.
Gas consumption
Gas consumption was calculated using the known wash-in time, 
FGF, vaporizer settings (VA concentration) and the vapour/
liquid quote for each AA: vapour (ml)/liquid (ml) = 184 and 
vapour (ml)/liquid (ml) = 210 for sevoflurane and desflurane respec-
tively. It means that 1ml of liquid AA equals 184ml and 210ml 
of vaporized sevoflurane and desflurane, respectively5.
This gives the equation: AA consumption

Statistical analysis
SPSS 24 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for statistical 
analysis. All wash-in data was presented as mean of 3 measure-
ments with standard deviation (SD) calculated. The mean time 
to reach 1 MAC for the different FGF was compared among the 
Flow-i and Aisys AM using analysis of variance (ANOVA). To 
determine which of the mean FGFs differed significantly from 
each other, we also performed Tukey’s post hoc test. A p< 0.05 was 
considered statistically significant.

Ethical statement
This is a test model study. The research does not involve human 
participants and/or animals, and thus no informed consent has 
been requested. The set-up is entirely experimental and no human 
or animals have been exposed to anaesthetics, and thus no ethical 
review board assessment has been considered necessary, according 
to Swedish research regulations.
Results
Wash-in times were significantly faster with higher flow rates for 
FGF spanning from 1, 2 and 4 l/min (p < 0.05) for all 4 groups 
(Figure 1 and Figure 2). There was however a plateau starting at 
FGF 4–4.75/4.8 l/min, where increasing the FGF further up to 6 
or 8 l/min did not shorten the time to reach 1 MAC significantly; 
similar patterns could be observed in all 4 groups. With Flow-i that 
plateau started at 4 and 4.8 l/min for sevoflurane and desflurane, 
respectively. With Aisys this plateau started at 4 l/min, for both 
the sevoflurane and desflurane group. Aisys had generally shorter 
wash-in times for both sevoflurane and desflurane at flow rates 
< 4 l/min. For flow rates of 4 l/min and above the difference was 
very small but somewhat more pronounced for desflurane wash-in, 
with Flow-i having shorter wash-in times than Aisys (Figure 1 and 
Figure 2). 
Anaesthetic agent consumption showed a somewhat different 
pattern (Figure 3). The lowest consumption differed between 
sevoflurane and desflurane and also between the Aisys and 
Flow-i. The lowest consumption of AA per wash-in for Flow-i 
sevoflurane and Flow-i/desflurane, 1.4ml and 3.9ml respectively, 
was calculated at FGF equal to minute ventilation (4.8 l/min). The 
lowest consumption of AA for Aisys /sevoflurane, 1.3 ml, was 
calculated at a FGF at 4 l/min. The lowest consumption of AA 
for Aisys /desflurane, 3 ml, was calculated at the lowest FGF 
(1 l/min), in difference to the other 3 groups, followed by FGF 2 and 
4 l/min with a calculated consumption of AA of 3.3 ml and 3.9 ml 
respectively. This was unique for Aisys /desflurane (Figure 3 A–D).

Wash-out times were faster at higher FGF until a plateau was 
reached at around FGF 4–6 l/min. Increasing the FGF further did 
not lead to faster wash-out times, except for the Aisys / sevoflurane 
group. The fastest wash-out time with Flow-i /sevoflurane, 349s, 
was recorded at FGF 6 l/min where it also plateaued. Wash-out 
times for Flow-i /desflurane plateaued at FGF 4 l/min and 1013s, 
which differed a few seconds from the fastest wash-out time, 1007s, 
recorded at FGF 8 l/min. Wash-out times for Aisys /sevoflurane 
had a plateau that was not as distinct as the other groups with the 
fastest wash-out time, 303s, recorded at FGF 10 l/min. The 
fastest wash-out time for Aisys /desflurane, 797s, was recorded 
at FGF 6 l/min, where it reached a clear plateau (Table 1). There 
was minor difference in elimination, Aisys being marginally faster 
(Figure 4 A–B). No statistical analysis was performed on the 
wash-out data.

Discussion
We found, in this test-lung setup, that it is possible to increase 
the anaesthetic agent concentration from 0 to 1 MAC value in 
around one minute by using a FGF of 4–4.8 l/min on both AMs, 
but raising the FGF further did not result in shorter wash-in times. 
These flow rates were also the most efficient, in terms of both 
speed and gas consumption for both anaesthetic agents (sevoflu-
rane and desflurane) and anaesthetic machines (Aisys and Flow-i) 
except when using Aisys and desflurane. Aisys had generally 
shorter wash-in times when using lower flow rates (< 4 l/min). 
For flow rates of 4 l/min and above, the difference was very small 
between the two machines tested. Anaesthetic agent consump-
tion showed different patterns, but Aisys had generally lower gas 
consumption than Flow-i for both AAs. The shortest wash-out 
times were found at FGFs of 4–6 l/min; raising the FGF further 
did not result in shorter wash-out times. Wash-out of desflurane 
from the test-lung was more than twice as time-consuming as the 
sevoflurane wash-out.
This is merely a test-lung study and it was expected that there 
would be more rapid wash-in with increased fresh gas flow, but it 
is important to acknowledge the plateau at around 4–5 l/min FGF. 
Our results also show that Maplesons mathematical calculations of 
a theoretical optimal FGF at around 4 l/min were accurate6. The 
result is also in line with what Shin et al. found in their study: 
increasing the FGF from low flow to moderately high flow will 
decrease the wash-in time7. However, our results show that there 
seem to be no benefits to raising the FGF to levels of 6 l/min and 
above while performing a wash-in.
Likewise the finding of increased AA consumption at both low 
and high FGFs is of interest, minimising the consumption of 
anaesthetic vapour is of economical as well as ecological impor-
tance. There was a difference between the AMs in terms of 
which FGF was most effective. We noted that the most effec-
tive FGF for the Flow-i, in terms of both consumption of AA and 
shortest wash-in time, was equal to the minute volume – 4.8 l/min. 
This applied to both sevoflurane and desflurane wash-in.
The small difference in wash-in between the AMs at lower fresh 
gas flows are in line with our previous study with a simpler test 
setup with sevoflurane8. We used a more “physiologic” test-lung 
setup in the present study, which we believe mimics functional 
residual capacity and tidal volume for a 70 kg male. Our test-
lung was constructed to represent both tidal volume (the volume 
of a normal breath) and the FRC in our test-lung setting, making 
the measurements more realistic. The Maquet test-lung 190 was 
representing the tidal volume and the two reservoir bags were 
representing a normal FRC (4 litre) in a 40-year-old male9. We 
used an external main stream multi gas sensor in the present study, 
possibly reducing the difference in monitor performance.
The finding that gas consumption is higher with desflurane than 
with sevoflurane may not be surprising, when taking the differ-
ence in MAC gas concentration into account. The huge difference, 
the twice as long time to eliminating desflurane as compared to 
sevoflurane, is to us however unexpected.
There are several limitations to this study, indeed this is merely a 
test-lung experiment and one may of course argue about its clini-
cal application. The vaporizer setting was fixed at 3 MAC. We 
believe that our findings have clinical implications; we know that 
high fresh gas flows do not provide major benefits during wash-
in or wash-out and there is the possibility to wash-in to a 1 MAC 
concentration within about a minute, 4 – 5 l/min FGF being 
the “optimal” time for wash-in. Both Aisys and Flow-i have 
built-in techniques for target end-tidal MAC, were fresh gas and 
vaporizers are automatically set to reach the target value10.

Conclusions
Wash-in times with fixed 3 MAC vaporizer settings decreased 
as the FGF increased, but plateaued at around flow rates of 
4–4.8 l/min (optimal flow) on both AM. It is more effec-
tive, in terms of consumption of AA, to use optimal flow 
than lower or higher flow rates. Wash-out times plateaued at 
around flow rates of 4–6 l/min, higher FGF than that does 
not produce faster wash-out times. Further studies are required 
to confirm our findings in clinical practice, but also to study the 
end tidal target algorithms available on the AMs.

Thank you for the opportunity to review this interesting article. It is wonderful to see research on 
basic science addressing questions which are often taken for granted in clinical practice. 
  
We do have a few questions: 
 
What is the clinical value of comparing sevoflurane and desflurane at the same MAC, if just 
the machines are of interest (and the solubility and clinical effects are negligible), would it 
not have been better to use the same vol%? 
 
1. 
There are only two factors influencing wash-in to the circuit, and those are circuit volume 
and fresh gas flow. Setting aside the patient at the end of the anesthesia machine, this 
study evaluates the wash-in/-out of the total apparatus dead space. To better compare the 
measurements from the Aisys and the Flow-I, it would be necessary to reference the 
volumes (bag/volume reflector, internal tubing, respective soda lime canister etc.) of both 
machines up to the y-piece. We presume they were not identical, but by how much do they 
differ? 
 
2. 
The wash-in time plateaued at around minute ventilation, which was to be expected, as 
both systems could be considered almost closed, with only minimal leakage. For the wash-
out, the lowest FGF that eliminates rebreathing should indicate the plateau. Whereas with 
sevoflurane there is no apparent difference between the machines, reflecting the

relationship between circle volume and FGF, the difference with desflurane is quite 
interesting. Could some materials used in the Flow-i have absorbed desflurane – We are 
thinking of the volume reflector or valves? 
 
We cannot completely follow the data files: if the main stream sensor was placed after the y-
piece, the high data points reflect Fi of the agent. Why was this position chosen and not the 
proximal (to the y-piece) end of the expiratory tube. This could have eliminated 
inspiratory/expiratory mixing in the acquisition, as the values were not recorded 
synchronized to the breath cycle. 
 
4. 
An illustration of the experimental setup could enhance understanding for the reader.

We do have a few questions:

What is the clinical value of comparing sevoflurane and desflurane at the same MAC, 
if just the machines are of interest (and the solubility and clinical effects are 
negligible), would it not have been better to use the same vol%?
○
The aim of the study was to compare the anaesthetic works-station and the two third generation 
in haled anaesthetics, aiming for an similar end-tidal 1 MAC gas concentration and subsequently 
time to wash-out has from these gas volumes.  
 
There are only two factors influencing wash-in to the circuit, and those are circuit 
volume and fresh gas flow. Setting aside the patient at the end of the anesthesia 
machine, this study evaluates the wash-in/-out of the total apparatus dead space. To 
better compare the measurements from the Aisys and the Flow-I, it would be 
necessary to reference the volumes (bag/volume reflector, internal tubing, respective 
soda lime canister etc.) of both machines up to the y-piece. We presume they were 
not identical, but by how much do they differ?
○
The present study was set up to gain insight to whether the machine different in time need to 
saturate internal and externa has reservoirs, including an anticipated normal adult lung volume.  
 
The wash-in time plateaued at around minute ventilation, which was to be expected, 
as both systems could be considered almost closed, with only minimal leakage. For 
the wash-out, the lowest FGF that eliminates rebreathing should indicate the plateau. 
Whereas with sevoflurane there is no apparent difference between the machines, 
reflecting the relationship between circle volume and FGF, the difference with 
desflurane is quite interesting. Could some materials used in the Flow-i have 
absorbed desflurane – We are thinking of the volume reflector or valves?
○
We are not able to assess potential losses. Both machines are “tested” and approved for use with 
both sevoflurane and desflurane. 
 
We cannot completely follow the data files: if the main stream sensor was placed 
after the y-piece, the high data points reflect Fi of the agent. Why was this position 
chosen and not the proximal (to the y-piece) end of the expiratory tube. This could 
have eliminated inspiratory/expiratory mixing in the acquisition, as the values were 
not recorded synchronized to the breath cycle.
○
The main-stream gas monitor was attached in parallel with in side-stream nipple. The readings, 
the recorded and presented values were the highest and stable values at each time-point. 
 
An illustration of the experimental setup could enhance understanding for the 
reader.

This report is interesting and may have clinical relevant in routine practice. However, the authors 
should address to the following points:
A figure showing the diagram of the circuit assembly including the test lung should be 
included. It’s quite confusing about the number of ‘Y-piece’. Normally, the test lung should 
be attached to the humidifier-filtered connected to a Y-piece. Why using 2 reservoir bags 
when normally only 1 is used in routine practice? Where is the location of the main stream 
sensor? 
 
1. 
Please quote a reference for ‘1 MAC adjusted of a 40 year-old (2% for sevoflurane and 6% 
for desflurane). It’s quite different from “Nickalls RWD. BJA 2003; 91: 170-4”. 
 
2. 
We have both anesthetic machines. The flowmeters on both Flow-i and AISYS are digitally 
controlled. They can be adjusted with accuracy of only 1 decimal place of litre, i.e., 0.1 L/min. 
Although the display on AISYS shows 2 decimal placed, i.e., 2.00 L/min, we can adjust flow of 
0.1 L/min at a time only. How can the authors set FGF at 4.75 L/min? 
 
3. 
The caption of Figures 3 and 4 does not match the figure, e.g., (a) in figure but (A) in caption. 
 
4. 
The wash-in time derived from a test lung may not be inferred to human lung. The major 
confounding factor of wash-in time is anesthetic agent uptake from lung into human body 
‘three compartments’ which affected by blood gas partition coefficient, cardiac output, 
organ tissue flow, organ tissue volume, and blood-tissue partition coefficient. That makes 
sevoflurane having longer wash-in time at same MAC and FGF. The test lung model did not 
take into account these factors. The authors should address to this point. 
 
5. 
The wash-out time has the same problem. The test lung did not consider amount of 
anesthetic agent uptake into the body which has to be eliminated out of the body into 
account. Normally, at the same MAC, sevoflurane has longer wash-out time compared with 
desflurane because of higher blood-gas, blood-tissue and blood-fat solubility. The authors 
should address to this point.

We used the FDA approved USP desflurane information sheet and Baxter Summary of Product 
characteristics; the 1 MAC for 40-45 years adult is set at 6 % (
www.baxter.com.pr/healthcare_professionals/.../suprane.html). Likewise for sevoflurane we 
used the FDA and Baxter product documentations, stating 1 MAC at aye of 40 being 2.1 % but we 
used for this study the MAC 2 and 6 %.

The flow setting should be with 1 decimal, the 4.75 is incorrect for the Flow-I corrected

Corrected excuse the edit mistake
The wash-in time derived from a test lung may not be inferred to human lung. The 
major confounding factor of wash-in time is anesthetic agent uptake from lung into 
human body ‘three compartments’ which affected by blood gas partition coefficient, 
cardiac output, organ tissue flow, organ tissue volume, and blood-tissue partition 
coefficient. That makes sevoflurane having longer wash-in time at same MAC and 
FGF. The test lung model did not take into account these factors. The authors should 
address to this point.
○
This is indeed merely an experimental test-lung set-up and we cannot comment on the human 
uptake and elimination, e.g. the impact of the different blood gas solubility for the agents tested.
The wash-out time has the same problem. The test lung did not consider amount of 
anesthetic agent uptake into the body which has to be eliminated out of the body into 
account. Normally, at the same MAC, sevoflurane has longer wash-out time 
compared with desflurane because of higher blood-gas, blood-tissue and blood-fat 
solubility. The authors should address to this point.
○
These, comments 6 & 7, are indeed one of limitations with our study, it is merely a test lung study. 
We have addressed the limitation in the discussion section, and we also clearly state that further 
studies are warranted confirming our results in the clinical setting. We still believe that our study 
provide information around the machines, how the workstations performs during wash-in and 
wash-out of the gaseous phases. The uptake, blood solubility and likewise elimination must of 
course be taken into account.

I have some questions to the authors regarding the study: The impact of fresh gas flow on wash-
in, wash-out time and gas consumption for sevoflurane and desflurane, comparing two 
anaesthesia machines, a test-lung study. by J. Jakobsson. 
 
Is there a difference between the two vaporizer used in the experiment?
1. 
Comment on the difference in a direct-injection and a bypass affect how respirators works.
2. 
Why the maximum inflow of the two gases? This is not clinically relevant. Would not it be 
better for another group with half the inflow, 4% and 8%?
3. 
Why non-parametric tests? Is this normal distribution of data?
4. 
The figures are not sufficient quality, high solution pictures please.
5. 
Explain in an educational way how you calculate gas consumption.
6. 
Do you have any theory why Aisys is faster at low flow with desflurane? Do you have any 
theories?
7. 
Why does it take longer to wash-out desflurane than sevoflurane in a mechanical lung 
model? This does not correspond to the clinical picture.
8. 
Does desflurane have lower density than sevoflurane? Is that why it takes longer to wash-
out the desfluran? Can you come up with some theories about the most remarkable result 
in the study?
9. 
I can not find sevoflurane wash-out in Figure 4. 
10. 
 
Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?
Yes
Is the study design appropriate and is the work technically sound?
Yes
Are sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others?
Yes
If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate?
I cannot comment. A qualified statistician is required.
Are all the source data underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility?
Yes
Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results?

Thank you for valid comments. Please find below responses to your queries.
Is there a difference between the two vaporizer used in the experiment?
○
Yes indeed both the technique to create the gaseous phase, the internal reservoir and the 
respiratory phase when gas is introduced into fresh gas. The Flow-i “injects gas” during 
inspiration while the Aysis has a more traditional vaporizer technique. The internal gas 
volume, reservoir is smaller in the Flow-i. This is the reason for our interest in comparing 
the machine, to assess how these different solution create difference during a rapid wash-
in, gas bolus.
Comment on the difference in a direct-injection and a bypass affect how respirators 
works.
○
The aim of the study was indeed to study how these different techniques act in a test-lung 
set up at different flow rates. It would also be interesting to study lower vaporizer settings 
at that study may be worth carrying out.
Why the maximum inflow of the two gases? This is not clinically relevant. Would not it 
be better for another group with half the inflow, 4% and 8%?
○
The aim of this study was to study the bolus, high concentration performance. It would 
indeed be of interest to study lower setting.
Why non-parametric tests? Is this normal distribution of data?
○
Traditional paremetric test was used, ANOVA test.
The figures are not sufficient quality, high solution pictures please.
○
We will improve image
Explain in an educational way how you calculate gas consumption.
○
The formula is derived from the reference.
Do you have any theory why Aisys is faster at low flow with desflurane? Do you have 
any theories?
○
This may be an effect of the different vaporizer techniques and the phase during 
inspiration/expiration gas is delivered to the fresh gas.
Why does it take longer to wash-out desflurane than sevoflurane in a mechanical 
lung model? This does not correspond to the clinical picture.
○
The finding is also to us somewhat surprising. One must acknowledge that this is merely 
the lung volume and circle wash-out. The low blodd gas solubility impacts the biological 
wash-out from the human body. It does not describe the elimination from volumes per see.
Does desflurane have lower density than sevoflurane? Is that why it takes longer to 
wash-out the desfluran? Can you come up with some theories about the most 
remarkable result in the study?
○
The longer wash-out may be related merely to the huger amount of gas, the 6 % gas 
volume.
I can not find sevoflurane wash-out in Figure 4. 
○
The Figure 4 A. presents sevoflurane wash-out.
