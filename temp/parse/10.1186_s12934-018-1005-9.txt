Abstract 
Background:  Geobacillus and Parageobacillus are two ecologically diverse thermophilic genera within the phy-
lum Firmicutes. These taxa have long been of biotechnological interest due to their ability to secrete thermostable 
enzymes and other biomolecules that have direct applications in various industrial and clinical fields. Despite the 
commercial and industrial interest in these microorganisms, the full scope of the secreted protein, i.e. the secretome, 
of Geobacillus and Parageobacillus species remains largely unexplored, with most studies focusing on single enzymes. 
A genome-wide exploration of the global secretome can provide a platform for understanding the extracellular func-
tional “protein cloud” and the roles that secreted proteins play in the survival and adaptation of these biotechnologi-
cally relevant organisms.
Results:  In the present study, the global secretion profile of 64 Geobacillus and Parageobacillus strains, comprising 
772 distinct proteins, was predicted using comparative genomic approaches. Thirty-one of these proteins are shared 
across all strains used in this study and function in cell-wall/membrane biogenesis as well as transport and metabo-
lism of carbohydrates, amino acids and inorganic ions. An analysis of the clustering patterns of the secretomes of the 
64 strains according to shared functional orthology revealed a correlation between the secreted profiles of different 
strains and their phylogeny, with Geobacillus and Parageobacillus species forming two distinct functional clades.
Conclusions:  The in silico characterization of the global secretome revealed a metabolically diverse set of secreted 
proteins, which include proteases, glycoside hydrolases, nutrient binding proteins and toxins.

Background
The genus Geobacillus was first proposed in 2001, where 
16S rRNA gene analysis supported the clustering of many 
thermophilic bacilli into a monophyletic group [1]. More 
recently, phylogenomic approaches resulted in the divi-
sion of the genus into two separate genera, Geobacillus 
and Parageobacillus [2]. Members of these genera are 
characterized by their thermophilicity, Gram-positive cell 
wall, and the formation of spores [1]. Due to their ability 
to sporulate and their catabolic versatility, Geobacillus 
and Parageobacillus species are cosmopolitan in nature, 
and can be readily isolated from diverse mesophilic and 
thermophilic environments, including temperate soils, 
compost, geothermal vents and oil wells [3]. In addition, 
they are considered attractive targets for biotechnology 
due to their ability to express and secrete several thermo-
stable enzymes, including proteases, xylanases, lipases, 
and carboxy-esterases [4, 5].
Gram-positive bacteria lack the outer membrane and 
periplasmic space, where many exported proteins would 
otherwise be retained, and therefore secrete a large num-
ber of proteins that play a significant metabolic role in 
the adaptation to the ecological niches that they occupy 
[6, 7]. Bacillus subtilis str. 168, one of the best charac-
terized Gram-positive bacteria, was shown empirically 
to secrete around 200 extracellular proteins [8, 9]. A 
recent in silico study focused on the secretomes of lac-
tic acid bacteria (LABs) predicted that their secretomes

can account for as much as 10% of the proteins encoded 
on a genome [10]. For the probiotic Bacillus clausii, a 
large secretome (~ 450 proteins) could be detected on 
2D-SDS PAGE gels [11]. By contrast, there is a relatively 
little information on the global secretomes of many ther-
mophilic bacteria, despite the known biotechnological 
advantages of their thermostable enzymes [12–14]. To 
date, most research has focused on specific thermosta-
ble extracellular enzymes, including alpha-amylases from 
G. stearothermophilus and G. thermoleovorans [15, 16], 
as well as a palm-oil degrading lipase from G. zalihae 
[17]. However, the development of rapid and inexpensive 
genome sequencing approaches and the growing number 
of available genome sequences provide a strong basis for 
exploring the secretomes of thermophiles. Such studies 
can facilitate an understanding of how secreted proteins 
contribute to the adaptation of these microorganisms to 
their native environments and support the further explo-
ration of thermostable enzymes for biotechnological 
objectives [18, 19]. This study presents the first compre-
hensive in silico analysis of the global secretome of the 
genera Geobacillus and Parageobacillus.
Results
Secretion pathways in Geobacillus and Parageobacillus
The transmembrane translocation of proteins relies on 
the presence of dedicated secretion pathways [20]. Two 
of these pathways, namely the sec-dependent and twin-
arginine dependent (TAT) pathway are common to both 
Gram-positive and Gram-negative taxa.
The Sec pathway comprises of the proteins SecYEG, 
which form a membrane-bound channel, the ATP-
dependent motor protein SecA, the proteins SecD and 
SecF which maintain a proton motive force for protein 
export, and the translocase YajC [20]. Furthermore, the 
foldase PrsA plays a role in the post-translocational fold-
ing of extracellular proteins [20]. Comparative genomic 
analysis of 64 Geobacillus and Parageobacillus genomes 
(Fig. 1) showed that orthologs of the main components of 
the Sec pathway are conserved throughout the two gen-
era. Genes encoding SecD, SecF, YajC, and PsrA ortho-
logues were found in the genomes of the 64 compared 
species.
Conversely, orthologs of the ATPase SecA and trans-
locase SecG genes were absent from the Geobacillus sp. 
B23 genome, while the genome of P. thermoglucosidasius 
M10EXG did not contain the genes secE and secY. Fur-
thermore, 50 of the compared genomes also contained 
a gene coding for an alternative ATPase, SecA2, which 
has been shown to be present in several Gram-positive 
taxa as part of an alternative Sec pathway for secretion 
of selected substrates such as large glycosylated lipopro-
teins [21]. The gene secA2 was found to be absent in all 
P. thermoglucosidasius genomes, suggesting that this 
species does not rely on the alternative Sec pathway for 
secretion.
The core of the twin-arginine translocation (TAT) path-
way in Gram-positive bacteria is the large six membrane-
spanning domain protein TatC and the small membrane 
protein TatA, which together form the channel for secre-
tion of folded proteins [22].The two main operons for Tat 
pathways in B. subtilis, namely tatAy-tatCy and tatAd-
tatCd [22], were found in varying degrees of representa-
tion across the Geobacillus and Parageobacillus genomes. 
The tatAy gene was found to be conserved across all 
genomes, and in 61 strains was found to form an oper-
onic unit with tatCy. This operon has been shown to be 
constitutively expressed in B. subtilis [22], and its preva-
lence in the isolates used in this study suggests a similar 
role in Geobacillus and Parageobacillus for secretion of 
folded proteins. Conversely, the tatA variant tatAd was 
found in 55 genomes, only seven of which also contained 
tatCd. TatAd has been previously described as a bifunc-
tional protein that can substitute for TatAy functionality 
if the latter is absent [22].
In addition to the Sec and Tat pathways, a number of 
Geobacillus and Parageobacillus strains were also found 
to encode a further protein secretion system. This type 
VII (T7SS) secretion system is associated with toxin 
secretion in pathogenic bacteria, such as Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis [23, 24]. T7SS-like secretion systems have 
also been identified in members of the phylum Firmi-
cutes, including B. subtilis [25]. The B. subtilis T7SS-like 
system is comprised of a seven gene operon, yukE-yukD-
yukC-yukBA-yueB-yueC-yueD, although yueD has been 
shown not to be involved in the secretion system [25]. 
The T7SS operon, excluding yueD, was found in eighteen 
of the 64 compared genomes, comprising three Geobacil-
lus and two Parageobacillus species and including all G. 
thermodenitrificans and P. thermoglucosidasius genomes. 
The genomes of three strains contain a partial operon, 
with Geobacillus sp. B4113 and G. icigianus ­DSM28325T 
missing the gene yukD, while, in Geobacillus sp. B4113 
the operon has undergone extensive rearrangements 
(Fig. 2).
The secretomes of Geobacillus and Parageobacillus
The secretomes of 49 Geobacillus and 15 Parageobacil-
lus genomes were determined by processing genome-
derived protein datasets through a secretion prediction 
pipeline, as described in the methods section. In this 
study, secretome was defined according to Desvaux 
et  al. [26] as proteins that are secreted extracellularly 
through specific secretion pathways and do not inte-
grate into the membrane through multiple transmem-
brane domains (TMs). The secretomes of the 64 isolates

ranged between 114 (G. kaustophilus HTA426; 2.86% of 
the total genomic protein content) to 179 (P. thermoglu-
cosidasius ­DSM2542T; 4.11% of the total genomic protein 
content) predicted proteins (Table 1; Fig. 3). The average 
percentage of secreted proteins across the 64 genomes 
was calculated as 3.82% of total genome protein con-
tent, and Geobacillus sp. B4109 contained the highest 
percentage of secreted proteins at 4.78% of total genome 
coding DNA sequences (CDSs), which is comparable to 
the empirically determined secretome of Bacillus subti-
lis 168 (4.79%) [8, 9], but is substantially smaller than the 
calculated secretome of the Gram-positive lactic acid 
bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM (10.41% of 
total protein content) [10]. The sizes of the secretomes of 
Geobacillus and Parageobacillus strains were found to be 
independent of genome size. For instance, Geobacillus sp. 
BCO2, which encodes the largest number of proteins on 
its genome (5233 proteins), was predicted to only secrete 
3.04% of its total protein content, while G. stearothermo-
philus ATCC ­12980T, which has the smallest number of 
proteins encoded on its genome, secretes 3.85% of the 
total proteins. 
The combinatorial approach used in this study was 
designed to decrease the number of potential false 
Fig. 1  Presence/absence of proteins belonging to the three protein secretion systems. The different secretion systems analysed are Sec (Yellow), 
Tat (blue), and T7SS (purple). Presence is indicated by red squares, while absence is indicated by blank squares. The presence/absence of the 
signal peptidase I (SPI), and lipoprotein signal peptidase (LSP) is also represented in the bracket between Sec and Tat. The dendrogram of the 64 
secretomes was produced using the UPGMA software, as described in the Methods section. The four clusters highlighted in the dendogram (Red—
Cluster I; Yellow—Cluster II; Green—Cluster III; Purple—Cluster IV) were determined according to the percentage of shared orthologous proteins 
between the secretion profiles of the 64 genomes. Strains belonging to each cluster are annotated in Table 1

positives in the prediction sets, and the final results 
yielded lower numbers of predicted proteins than 
obtained from any secretion prediction method used by 
itself (data not shown). It is also important to note that 
prediction methods used for in silico secretome analysis 
have been shown to overestimate the number of secreted 
proteins. For instance, B. subtilis was predicted to secrete 
300 proteins using predictive software, but was shown 
empirically to secrete close to 200 proteins [9]. Thus, the 
combinatorial approach used in this study was chosen to 
mitigate this bias.
The global secretome of Geobacillus and Parageobacillus
The combined secretome of the 64 Geobacillus and Para-
geobacillus isolates is comprised of 772 distinct proteins. 
The proteins in this dataset were classified according to 
their Conserved Orthologous Group (COG) functional 
categories (Fig. 4). A total of 438 proteins were function-
ally annotated and assigned to 18 COG categories, with 
the largest fraction of the secretome being assigned to 
proteins of unknown function (S, 38.27%), followed by 
carbohydrate transport and metabolism (G, 10.05%), cell 
wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis (M, 5.82%), inor-
ganic ion (P, 4.58%) and amino acid (E, 5.11%) transport 
and metabolism, respectively (Fig. 4).
In terms of signal peptide distribution, 263 proteins 
(34.06%) contained a Sec-type signal peptide recognised 
by type I signal peptidases, while 133 proteins (17.23%) 
contained leader peptides with the conserved lipobox 
signature domain (Fig. 4) [9]. A larger percentage of the 
global secretome (369 proteins, 47.79%) did not have an 
assigned signal peptide, most of which were present in 
sequences with no functional annotation. These proteins 
were predicted as ‘secreted’ using one of the programs 
from the prediction pipeline, PsortB, which assigns sub-
cellular localization scores based on structural predic-
tions as well as presence/absence of signal peptides, and 
therefore is more selective for sequences that do not con-
tain conventional signal peptides [27]. Only four proteins 
in the entire global secretome contained Tat-specific 
leader peptides. Twenty-four sequences belonging to the 
S category were found to contain WXG-type domains, 
which are specific to the T7SS and T7SS-like secretion 
systems [24].
The 64 compared isolates were further grouped into 
four distinct clusters on the basis of the number of shared 
orthologous proteins (Fig. 5). The largest cluster, cluster 
I, is composed of twenty-five genomes that include G. 
kaustophilus, G. thermocatenulatus, G. zalihae, G. and 
jurassicus. Cluster II contains fourteen genomes and 
is dominated by G. stearothermophilus strains, while

genes; red, toxin genes; green-mobile element genes; blue- repetitive domain protein gene

cluster III is the smallest with ten genomes that include 
G. thermodenitrificans, G. icigianus and G. subterraneus. 
Members of the genus Parageobacillus form a distinct 
cluster, cluster IV, with fifteen genomes that included P. 
caldoxylosilyticus, P. toebii, P. thermoglucosidasius, and P. 
thermoantarcticus strains (Table 1).
A minimal core secretome is conserved among Geobacillus 
and Parageobacillus species
A comparison of the groups of orthologues shared 
within and between the clusters showed that a total of 
only thirty-one proteins (4.14% of the global secretome) 
have orthologs in all Geobacillus and Parageobacillus 
genomes. This low number of core proteins reflects the 
high degree of functional variability between the clus-
ters. Similarly, the number of shared orthologs within 
each cluster was proportional to the number of strains in 
that cluster, with clusters III and IV containing the lowest 
number of shared orthologs (54 and 46 proteins, respec-
tively), followed by cluster II (62 proteins), and cluster I 
(63 proteins). The clustering of the secretomes according 
to number of shared proteins also conserves the phylo-
genetic groups previously determined by Aliyu et al. [2] 
(Fig. 6, Additional file 1: Table S1), with many of the spe-
cies clades retaining the same architecture.
The core secretome was largely dominated by pro-
teins in the COG functional categories of cell wall bio-
genesis and sporulation, proteins involved in nutrient 
scavenging and transport across the cell wall/mem-
brane, and proteins of unknown function. Cell wall 
biogenesis/sporulation proteins include several car-
boxypeptidases such as the spore cortex lytic enzyme 
SleB and two DL-endopeptidases, CwlO and LytE, 
which are involved in the cleavage of the peptidogly-
can stem peptide during different growth stages [28, 
29]. Other hydrolases present in the core secretome 
included the autolysins SpoIID and SpoIIP, which are 
required for septal hydrolysis during the sporulation 
process [30]. In addition, the putative gamma-glutamyl 
transferase YwrD, which is also part of the core protein 
set, has been hypothesised to be involved in amino acid 
transport into the cell and in glutathione metabolism 
due to its orthology to the gamma-glutamyl transpepti-
dase Ggt [31]. Alternately, YwrD in Geobacillus and 
Parageobacillus might play a similar role to the gamma-
glutamyl transferase in B. subtilis, which is involved in

the degradation of the poly-gamma-glutamate capsule 
[32]. However, the nature of the capsule in Geobacil-
lus and Parageobacillus could not be inferred from the 
secretome data, and therefore it is uncertain whether 
YwrD plays a role in its formation.
Metabolic capabilities of the Geobacillus 
and Parageobacillus secretome
To further assess the function of the global secretome, 
the annotated protein fraction was screened for spe-
cific functions and domains using KAAS (KEGG Auto-
matic Annotation Server) [33], SMART (Simple Modular 
Architecture Research Tool) [34], Uniprot [35], CAZy 
(carbohydrate-active enzyme) [36], CDD (Conserved 
Domains Database) [37] and TCDB (Transporter Clas-
sification Database) [38] databases. The global secretome 
was found to harbour a large number of functional pro-
tein families, which include glycoside hydrolases, lipases, 
proteases, nucleases and toxins (Additional file 2: Tables 
S2, S3).
Adaptations to environmental constraints
Functional analysis of the global secretome of Geobacil-
lus and Parageobacillus revealed the presence of proteins 
involved in the general adaptation to thermophilic envi-
ronments. These include substrate-binding proteins from 
the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily [39] that 
support heterotrophic growth on a range of organic and 
inorganic substrates (Fig.  7). Of note is the prevalence 
of SBPs for nitrate/sulfonate/bicarbonate (3.A.1.17.2) as 
well as iron (III) (3.A.1.14.9), which are used as electron 
acceptors during anaerobic respiration.
SBPs for trehalose and maltose (3.A.1.1.41) and gly-
cine betaine (3.A.1.12.11) were found to be prevalent in 
genomes from clusters I, II, and III. These compatible 
solutes play a crucial role in the general adaptive strat-
egy of xerotolerant micro-organisms due to their abil-
ity of reduce intracellular viscosity through vitrification, 
therefore inhibiting membrane and protein disruption 
caused by lack of intracellular water [40, 41]. An SBP 
which is specific for the polyamines spermidine and sper-
mine (3.A.1.11.8) is prevalent in all species from cluster 
IV, as well as G. jurassicus and G. thermodenitrificans. 
These organic compounds prevent thermal inactivation

of DNA and ribosomes, and have previously been associ-
ated with thermo-adaptation traits in Geobacillus species 
[42]. Another protein belonging to the Hsp20/alpha crys-
talline family of heat-shock proteins (WP_033014044.1) 
was found in the secretion profiles of 60 strains.
Screening using the dbCAN database [36] identi-
fied 51 distinct proteins with glycoside hydrolase (GH) 
domains (Additional file  3: Figure S1), which include 
enzymes involved in the degradation of complex poly-
saccharides from plant cell wall, hemicellulose, cellulose 
and pectin. The hemicellulose degradation locus has 
been extensively characterized in G. stearothermophilus 
T6 [43], and was shown to be a prevalent and versatile 
feature in Geobacillus and Parageobacillus species [5, 
44]. This locus includes a gene coding for the GH family 
10 xylanase XynA1 which degrades the xylan backbone 
into 
xylooligosaccharides 
before 
transport 
across 
the cell membrane [45]. In the present study, XynA1 
(WP_044731438) was detected in 23 Geobacillus (sixteen 
from cluster I) and two Parageobacillus genomes, in all 
cases coinciding with the presence of an SBP for xylo-oli-
gosaccharides (3.A.1.1.9).
The global secretome was also found to contain puta-
tive polymorphic proteins that could be involved in 
intra- and inter-species competition in crowded micro-
bial communities. In particular six WXG-type proteins 
with distinct toxin domains were detected across six-
teen of the genomes that contained either the complete 
or partial T7SS locus. Analysis using the CDD database 
and SMART revealed that these putative toxins shared 
the same domain architecture with a highly conserved 
N-terminus WXG100 secretion domain (PF06013) and 
linker pre-toxin (PT-TG) domain, as well as a hypervari-
able C-terminal region containing the toxin domain. Of 
the six putative toxins, four contain nuclease-fold C-ter-
minal domains, including the RNase Ntox50 (PF15542), 
as well the tox-SHH (PF15652), -GHH (IPR028916), 
and -AHH HNH/EndoVII domains. These have been 
recently identified as members of a novel superfamily of 
diffusible polymorphic toxins that act by non-specific 
nucleotide degradation after transport across the cell 
wall of the target host [46]. In addition, one putative 
toxin (WP_003248146.1) in the dataset also contains a 
C-terminal colicin-like bacteriocin domain (PF12639), 
which also has endonuclease activity [47, 48]. These 
putative toxins were found to be more prevalent in P. 
thermoglucosidasius secretomes, with P. thermoglucosi-
dasius TNO09.020, P. thermoglucosidasius YU, and P.

Biotechnologically relevant proteins
In addition to the proteins described above, the func-
tional characterization of the global secretome revealed 
the presence of putative proteins with significant 
homology to biotechnologically relevant enzymes. This 
included a GH3 family putative beta-N-acetylhexosa-
minidase (WP_033018107.1), which was detected in 
seventeen genomes in clusters III and IV. This protein 
is orthologous to NagZ from B. subtilis, which has cata-
lytic activity against xylans as well as chitin [49]. Another 
putative xylanase-chitin deacetylase (WP_066233069.1) 
containing a domain with homology to the NodB chitoo-
ligosaccharide deacetylase domain from Rhizobium [50], 
was found to be shared by 41 genomes.
The protein Abp (EPR29279.1), a GH27 family beta-
L-arabinopyranosidase involved in the digestion of ara-
bino-polysaccharides [51], was found to be present in

nine Geobacillus strains, as was a putative GH53 family 
endo-beta-1,4-galactanase (GAD13376.1) with 98.6% 
average amino acid identity with GanB from G. stearo-
thermophilus. This protein, which is involved in the deg-
radation of the galactan side chains of pectin [52], forms 
part of the secretome of eight strains in clusters I and III.
Alpha-amylases hydrolyse alpha-D-glucosidic linkages 
in complex polysaccharides such as starch and glycogen, 
and are widely used in detergents, starch modification 
in the paper industry, and the production of ethanol as a 
liquid biofuel [53]. Screening of the global secretome for 
proteins with the alpha-amylase domain GH13 revealed 
that twenty-four strains from clusters I, II, and III are pre-
dicted to secrete a large amylopullulanase (KYD25568.1) 
with high sequence homology to Apu from G. thermoleo-
vorans, which shows high affinity to pullulan and amy-
lopectin [54]. Twenty-one strains from the same three 
clusters contain orthologues of the alpha-amylase AmyS 
from G. stearothermophilus (WP_080706509.1) [55]. In 
addition, a putative GH13 hydrolase (WP_042408692.1) 
was found in P. caldoxylosilyticus ­DSM12041T, P. caldox-
ylosilyticus B4119, P. toebii WCH70, and G. subterraneus 
­DSM13552T with 38% average amino acid identity to the 
maltogenic alpha-amylase Novamyl, which is used as an 
anti-staling agent [56].
Lipases and carboxylesterases are versatile enzymes 
that catalyse both the hydrolysis and esterification of 
lipids, under aqueous and non-aqueous conditions, 
respectively, making them essential enzymes for cell 
membrane recycling and conversion of non-metaboliza-
ble polysaccharides [57]. These enzymes also hold a large 
percentage of the industrial enzyme market, and are used 
in a number of industrial processes, from conversion of 
palm oil into high value cosmetic and food components, 
oil removal in detergents and other cleaning products 
and transesterification of vegetable oils to biodiesel [58, 
59]. Two different lipolytic enzymes were identified in 
the global secretome, both of which were found to be 
restricted to members of the genus Geobacillus used in 
this study. A lipase (KZE97058.1) sharing 95% average 
amino acid identity with a thermolipase from Bacillus sp. 
42 forms part of the secretome of 44 Geobacillus strains 
in clusters I-III. The Bacillus sp. 42 orthologue functions 
optimally at 70 °C and tolerant to various polar organic 
solvents such as DSMO and ethanol, which makes it a 
potential biocatalyst for biodiesel production [60]. Fur-
thermore, orthologues of a GDSL- family carboxylester-
ase from G. thermodenitrificans T2, which hydrolyses 
short-chain ester substrates, were found in 57 secretomes 
from the four clusters.
Proteases play vital roles in many physiological pro-
cesses such cell wall biogenesis, quality control of 
secreted proteins, the degradation of oligopeptides 
into amino acids that are transported intracellularly, 
cell viability and pathogenicity [61, 62]. Screening the 
secretome against the MEROPS database [63] revealed 
two proteases with orthology to biotechnologically-
relevant biocatalysts. The first is a thermostable neutral 
protease (AKM20115.1) that is present in the secretomes 
of 48 compared strains across the four clusters. This 
protein shares 72.5% average amino acid identity with 
Thermolysin from G. stearothermophilus, which is used 
commercially in the production of the artificial sweet-
ener aspartame [4]. The second is an S8 family alkaline 
serine protease (WP_008881971.1), found in eleven 
secretomes across Clusters III and IV, sharing 41.0% 
amino acid sequence identity with Subtilisin BPN’ from 
B. amyloliquefaciens, which is used as a detergent addi-
tive [64].
Correlation between predicted and experimental data
To assess the accuracy of the predictive pipeline used 
in this study, a selection of Geobacillus and Parageo-
bacillus type strains were experimentally assayed for 
selected activities of secreted enzymes in spent cultiva-
tion medium supernatant. Table  2 shows the correla-
tion between the predicted and experimental results for 
α-amylase, xylanase, and lipase/eterase activities across 
the eight type strains tested.
The ability of the different type strains to degrade oat 
spelt xylan was found to exactly correlate with the pres-
ence or absence of xylan-degrading hydrolases in the 
predicted secretome. G. thermodenitrificans DSM ­465T, 
which was predicted to contain the GH family 10 xyla-
nase XynA1as well as  the beta-N-acetylhexosamini-
dase  discussed above, exhibited the highest activity 
(33.78 nkat.ml−1, Additional file  4: Figure S2). By com-
parison, P. thermoglucosidasius DSM ­2542T and P. ther-
moantarcticus M ­1T, which lack either XynA1 or the 
beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase 
respectively, 
exhibited 
significantly lower activity (10.67 nkat  ml−1 and 15.99 
nkat ml−1, respectively). Surprisingly P. caldoxylosilyticus 
DSM ­12041T exhibited very low activity (1.74 nkat ml−1), 
despite secreting the same xylan-degrading enzymes as P. 
thermoglucosidasius. Interestingly, both G. stearothermo-
philus ATCC 12980T and P. toebii DSM ­14590T exhibited 
xylan-degrading activity against oat spelt xylan, despite 
lacking the genes for XynA1 and the NagZ deacetylase 
orthologue. Both strains share the putative extracellular 
xylanase-chitin deacetylase (WP_066233069.1) that is 
present across 41 secretion profiles of the four clusters.
Similarly, α-amylase plate activity assays (Additional 
file  5: Figure S3) reflected the predicted distribution of 
this enzyme. Of the eight strains tested, only G. stearo-
thermophilus ATCC ­12980T, which is predicted to 
Page 14 of 19
Lebre et al. Microb Cell Fact  (2018) 17:156 
encode an α-amylase (WP_080706509.1) showed activity 
against starch.
Lipolytic activity was determined by means of p-nitro-
phenyl butyrate (PNPB) degradation assays. All eight 
tested strains exhibited varying degrees of activity 
against PNPB (Additional file 6: Figure S4). Two of the 
four strains predicted to secrete a lipase (KZE97058.1), 
G. kaustophilus DSM ­7263T and G. stearothermophilus 
ATCC ­12980T, showed high rates of activity (83.82 and 
56.86 U ml−1, respectively), while the two other Geobacil-
lus strains exhibited comparatively lower activities. None 
of the Parageobacillus strains used in the assays were pre-
dicted to secrete a lipase. However, some lipolytic activity 
could be observed for the assays with P. caldoxylosilyti-
cus, P. toebii and P. thermoglucosidasius. This activity may 
explained by the presence of an extracellular GDSL-fam-
ily carboxylesterase, noting that many carboxylesterases 
can hydrolyse PNPB. However, P. thermoantarcticus 
M1T was not predicted to secrete either lipases or car-
boxylesterases. A orthologue of the carboxylesterase is 
present in the genome of P. thermoantarcticus, but this 
enzyme lacks the signal peptides required for secretion. 
It cannot be excluded, however, that this carboxylesterase 
may be secreted through non-classical pathways.
Discussion
Geobacillus and Parageobacillus are cosmopolitan Gram-
positive taxa that are able to tolerate the multiple abiotic 
stresses in the biomes in which they are found (Table 1). 
Some of the characteristic ‘extreme’ conditions of such 
biomes include elevated temperatures, desiccation 
(e.g. desert soils), extremes of pH and high salinity (e.g. 
saline playas) and metal-induced toxicity (e.g. hydro-
thermal vents) [65]. The identification and analysis of the 
secretomes of these bacteria might therefore contribute 
to an understanding of how they adapt to such a broad 
range of environmental stresses.
It has previously hypothesized that sporulation is the 
main contributing factor to the dispersal and survival 
of Geobacillus across a wide range of biomes [3]. The 
concept of sporulation as a universal survival strategy is 
corroborated by the prevalence of sporulation-related 
carboxypeptidases and cortex-lytic proteins in the core 
secretome of Geobacillus and Parageobacillus. How-
ever, evidence for additional stress tolerance mecha-
nisms associated with thermophiles can also be found in 
the global secretome. An extracellular iron/manganese 
superoxide dismutase, which is found in the 64 Geobacil-
lus and Parageobacillus genomes, is involved in the scav-
enging toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by 
many heterotrophic bacteria as a by-product of the cata-
lytic activity of NAD(P)H oxidoreductases [66]. Addi-
tionally, SBPs for compatible solutes found across most 
Geobacillus and Parageobacillus genomes suggest that 
these play an important role in survival during periods of 
extreme heat and desiccation.
The metabolic signatures found in the global secretome 
also suggest that Geobacillus and Parageobacillus are 
metabolic versatile bacteria with the capacity to utilize a 
large range of monosaccharide and polysaccharide sub-
strates Additionally, the secretome suggested that Geo-
bacillus and Parageobacillus have the capacity to perform 
anaerobic respiration using iron, nitrates and sulphates 
as electron acceptors. Geobacillus and Parageobacillus 
might thus employ an versatile opportunistic survival 
strategy, in which cells are able to rapidly switch from a 
dormant spore state to an actively growing phase.
Conversely, the secretion profiles of Geobacillus and 
Parageobacillus species were found to be highly hetero-
geneous, even within the same species. This functional 
heterogeneity across and within each genus is not sur-
prising, considering the diversity of ecological niches 
from which the strains have been isolated. Alternately, 
the fact that the clustering of strains according to shared 
percentage of protein orthologues preserved the phy-
logenetic clustering at species and genus levels suggests 
that the secretomes of Geobacillus and Parageobacillus 
species are composed of a significant share of genes that 
have been vertically maintained through the evolution-
ary speciation process. It is important to note that while 
the genomes used in this study exhibit different levels of 
completeness, they were carefully selected on the basis of 
assembly status, with genomes of inferior quality being 
excluded. Thus, we argue that the functional heteroge-
neity described in this study represents a good approxi-
mation of the true genetic differences between strains 
rather than a bias created by the addition of incomplete 
genomes.
The global secretome of Geobacillus and Parageobacil-
lus is of likely interest in several biotechnology sectors 
due to the ability of these organisms to secrete a wide 
range of thermostable biocatalysts [67]. Examples include 
the well-characterized XynA1 from G. stearothermo-
philus, which has been implicated in the production of 
second-generation biofuels from plant biomass [68]. This 
study has revealed several other, yet uncharacterized, 
proteins with significant orthology to potentially useful 
biocatalysts (Additional file  7: Table  S3). For instance, 
analysis of the global secretome revealed the presence 
of uncharacterized WXG100-type polymorphic tox-
ins in Parageobacillus species and the closely related G. 
thermodenitrificans. These bacteriocins might represent 
targets as novel antimicrobial agents, particularly in the 
food industry where thermostability is a desirable trait 
to prevent pathogen persistence during the preservation 
process [69].

It is worth noting that a significant percentage of proteins 
in the global secretome (46.07% of the dataset) are hypo-
thetical or have no significant homology to domains and 
sequences in the databases used in this study. The presence 
of these secreted “dark matter” proteins highlights the fact 
that Geobacillus and Parageobacillus biology is still largely 
unexplored and has the capacity to reveal novel traits and 
functions and products of biotechnological value.
The experimental assays performed in this study vali-
date the predictive pipeline used for the analysis of the 
global secretome of Geobacillus and Parageobacil-
lus. However, additional empirical studies such as gene 
expression assays and knock-out experiments on selected 
proteins are needed to further elaborate the significance 
and relevance of the secreted proteins identified and 
described in this study.
Conclusions
This study provides the first comprehensive in silico 
exploration of the Geobacillus and Parageobacillus 
global secretome. The functional analysis of the 772 pro-
teins that make up the combined secretome of the 64 
strains used in this study revealed a functionally diverse 
group of species with a small core of 31 proteins that are 
involved in phylum-wide conserved processes such as 
sporulation, cell-wall biogenesis, and nutrient scavenging.
An exploration of the biotechnological potential of 
the combined secretome revealed several proteins with 
either a proven use in industrial processes or the poten-
tial to be applied in industrial or medical fields. However, 
while the identification of biotechnological candidates 
through orthology to known biocatalysts has revealed 
several target proteins in the secretome that warrant fur-
ther research, these candidates might only represent the 
‘tip of the iceberg’ of the biotechnological potential of 
the Geobacillus and Parageobacillus secretome, as a large 
percentage of the proteins in the secretome has yet to be 
characterized. As such, this study represents a frame-
work from which the biotechnological potential of these 
two thermophilic genera can be further explored.
Methods
Geobacillus and Parageobacillus genomes
The genomes of 49 Geobacillus strains and 15 Parageoba-
cillus strains were obtained from the GenBank assembly 
database [70] and the JGI IMG genome portal [71]. The 
genome assemblies were further improved as previously 
described [2]. The final dataset comprised twenty-two 
complete genomes and 42 high quality draft genomes 
(Table 1). Structural annotation of the genomes was per-
formed using the SEED-based RAST server [72]. The 
core genome phylogeny of Geobacillus and Parageoba-
cillus species was constructed as previously described by 
Aliyu et al. [2]. Briefly, core gene sets for Geobacillus and 
Parageobacillus species were aligned and concatenated, 
from which a maximum likelihood tree was constructed.
Prediction of the global secretome
The protein datasets derived from each genome were 
screened for secreted proteins using a combination of 
predictive software that scan for the presence/absence of 
signal peptides (SignalP v4.0 [73] and TatP [74]) as well 
as sub-cellular localization (PsortB 3.0 [27] and CELLO 
v.2.5 [75]). The location of the signal peptides was con-
firmed using PRED-TAT [76] and PRED_LIPO [77], and 
the presence of transmembrane domains was predicted 
using TMHMM [78]. The predicted secretion profiles 
of the different genomes were compared for number of 
shared orthologues using Proteinortho 5 [79] with the 
cut-off of 40% sequence identity, 50% sequence cover-
age, and e-value of < 1 e−5. Orthologous sequences were 
binned under unique identifiers and the global secretome 
was assembled by retaining representatives of each 
unique secreted protein. A presence/absence matrix was 
obtained by mapping each secretome against the global 
secretome, and secretomes were subsequently clustered 
into groups according to the number of shared ortho-
logues. The percentage of shared orthology between 
secretion profiles was also calculated from the number 
of shared protein sequences, and these data were used to 
plot a UPGMA dendrogram using DendroUPGMA [80].
Functional annotation of the global secretome
The global secretome was re-annotated using NCBI Blast 
[81], Uniprot Blast [35], KAAS [33], and eggNOG map-
per [82], which was also used to determine Conserved 
Orthologous Group functional categories [83]. Predicted 
secreted proteins were screened for the presence of con-
served domains using Uniprot Blast, SMART [34] and 
the NCBI Conserved Domain Database using the Batch 
CD-Search algorithm [37]. Sequences were manually 
curated for biotechnologically relevant proteins using 
the databases described above, as well as scanned for car-
bohydrate active enzymes using the dbCAN Blast tool

against the CAZY database [36] and for peptidases by 
BLAST search against the MEROPS database [63].
Bacteria used for the enzyme activity assays
The type strains of four Geobacillus (G. subterraneus 
DSM ­13552T, G. kaustophilus DSM ­7263T, G. stearo-
thermophilus ATCC ­12890T, G. thermodenitrificans 
DSM ­465T) and four Parageobacillus (P. thermoglucosi-
dasius DSM ­2542T, P. caldoxylosilyticus DSM ­12041T, 
P. toebii DSM ­14590T, and P. thermoantarcticus M ­1T)
where provided by the Bacillus Genomic Stock Centre 
(D.R. Zeigler, Ohio State University, USA). All strains 
were routinely maintained in mLB media (10  g/l Tryp-
tone, 5 g/l Yeast Extract, 5 g/l NaCl) with trace elements 
(1  mM Nitrilotrioacetic acid, 0.59  mM ­MgSO4·7H2O, 
0.91 mM ­CaCl2·2H2O, 0.04 mM ­FeSO4·7H2O) and incu-
bated at 60 °C and 150 rpm.
Xylanase activity assays
After overnight inoculation in mLB media a total of 
500 µl of each culture was transferred into 5 ml of Oat 
Spelt (OS) Xylan media (10 g/l OS Xylan, 3 mM ­K2HPO4, 
1.7  mM ­KH2PO4, 6.25  mM ­NH4NO3, trace elements 
as described above) and grown at 60  °C and 150  rpm 
for 16  h. Supernatants were collected by centrifug-
ing the cells at 6000g for 5 min, and subsequently used 
to measure the rates of xylan degradation. Xylan degra-
dation rates were determined using the DNS method 
[84], where 250 µl of sample was incubated with 750 µl 
3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNSA) buffer (95  mM DNSA, 
1 M Potassium Sodium Tartrate, 0.5 M NaOH) at 100 °C 
for 15  min, after which the absorbance of each sample 
was measured at 540  nm using a MultiskanGO spec-
trophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA). Absorbance 
measurements were performed for triplicate samples, 
and non-inoculated xylan media samples were used as 
negative controls. Activity (in nkat ml−1) was calculated 
by measuring the absorbance of each sample against 
a d-xylose standard curve. One nkat is defined as the 
amount of enzyme required to degrade one nmol of sub-
strate under the stated conditions.
Amylase activity assays
Cultures were grown in 5  ml of mLB for 16  h and the 
supernatant collected using the protocol described above. 
After collection, 150  µl of supernatant of each culture 
was loaded into wells in 1% starch agar plates (1% w/v 
soluble Starch, 2% w/v Agar). The plates were incubated 
for 16  h at 60  °C and subsequently stained with iodine 
tincture (2.5% w/v Iodine, 2.5% w/v Potassium Iodine). A 
30 mg/ml solution of alpha-amylase from Aspergillus ory-
zae (Sigma-Aldrich®, Product code: 9001-19-8) in water 
was used as the positive control. Plates were incubated in 
triplicate, and activity was assessed by measuring zones 
of clearance in the stained plates.
Lipase activity assays
Lipase activity was inferred by measuring p-nitrophenyl 
butyrate (PNPB) degradation rates at 400  nm. Cultures 
were grown for 16  h as described above, in a modi-
fied version of mLB to which 0.5% tributyrin was added 
before inoculation. Culture supernatants were recovered 
by centrifugation, and 100 μl volumeswere resuspended 
in 900  µl reaction buffer (100  mM ­NaH2PO4, 150  mM 
NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, pH 7.2). 10 µl of 50 mM 
PNPB was added and the absorbance (400  nm) meas-
ured every 30 s for 5 min at 60 °C. Solution containing 
the reaction buffer, non-inoculated media and PNPB 
were used as negative controls. All measurements were 
performed in triplicates. The rate of PNPB degradation 
in units/ml enzyme was determined using the following 
equation:
Units ml−1 enzyme = (A400nm/min sample −A400nm/min control)(1.01)(dilution factor)
(0.0148)(0.1)
