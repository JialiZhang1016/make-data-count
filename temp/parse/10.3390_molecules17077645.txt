Abstract: A computer-aided predictions of antioxidant activities were performed with the 
Prediction Activity Spectra of Substances (PASS) program. Antioxidant activity of 
compounds 1, 3, 4 and 5 were studied using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 
lipid peroxidation assays to verify the predictions obtained by the PASS program. 
Compounds 3 and 5 showed more inhibition of DPPH stable free radical at 10−4 M than the 
well-known standard antioxidant, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). Compound 5 exhibited 
promising in vitro inhibition of Fe2+-induced lipid peroxidation of the essential egg yolk as 
a lipid-rich medium (83.99%, IC50 16.07 ± 3.51 µM/mL) compared to -tocopherol  
(-TOH, 84.6%, IC50 5.6 ± 1.09 µM/mL). The parameters for drug-likeness of these BHT 
analogues were also evaluated according to the Lipinski’s “rule-of-five” (RO5). All the 
BHT analogues were found to violate one of the Lipinski’s parameters (LogP > 5), even 
though they have been found to be soluble in protic solvents. The predictive polar surface 
area (PSA) and absorption percent (% ABS) data allow us to conclude that they could have 
a good capacity for penetrating cell membranes. Therefore, one can propose these new 
multipotent antioxidants (MPAOs) as potential antioxidants for tackling oxidative stress 
and lipid peroxidation processes.

1. Introduction 
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generally considered responsible for many cell disorders and the 
development of many undesired processes, including aging [1], inflammatory [2] and many others [3–7]. 
Phenolic primary antioxidants are the most active dietary antioxidants [8]. The commonly used 
synthetic antioxidants in foods are butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) [9], butylated hydroxytoluene 
(BHT) [10] (Figure 1).

BHT (CAS 128-37-0; NCI C03598) was patented in 1947 [11]. It was found that two tert-butyl 
groups flanking the OH group are required to retain in vivo anti-inflammatory potency [12]. Following 
the same route, researchers of Parke-Davis have disclosed a new class of potent, selective and orally 
active COX-2 inhibitors incorporating the 2,6-di-tert-butyl phenol moiety, such as PD 164387 and PD 
138387 (Figure 2) [13,14].

Based on the Parke-Davis COX-2 inhibitors, researchers have investigated their SAR to improve 
COX-2 selective inhibitors containing a 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol substituent as an antioxidant moiety [15]. 
Their selectivity might be related to their free-radical scavenging potency [15].

On the other hand, sterically hindered phenols linked with heterocyclic rings have also been 
extensively studied as dual COX/5-LOX inhibitors [16–18]. A combination of radical scavenging 
properties and anti-inflammatory activity has already been proven for a number of non-steroidal  
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [19,20]. However, BHT derivatives have become attractive antioxidant 
or co-antioxidant groups [21]. Therefore, it is no surprise that BHT has been modified to prepare a 
series of new antioxidants having new medicinal properties in the pharmaceutical industry [12,22,23]. 
Recently, qualitative SARS and rational-design strategies for antioxidants have been used to combine 
multiple functions; including various multiple antioxidant properties such as radical-scavenging ability 
and diversified pharmacological activities to offer hybrid compounds, which can exert multiple 
pharmacological functions through one molecular framework [24–26]. 
Thiosemicarbazides have been reported to show antibacterial [27], antimicrobial [28,29],  
anti-toxoplasmagondii [29] and antioxidant [30] activities. To date acyl derivatives of thiosemicarbazide 
bearing BHT moiety have been rarely synthesized. 
Compounds containing the 1,3,4-thiadiazole nucleus have a wide range of pharmacological activities 
that include antimicrobial [31], antitubercular [32], anticancer [33,34] and antioxidant [35] properties. 
1,2,4-Triazoles are an important class of five membered heterocyclic compounds. 1,2,4-Triazole-5-
thiones are known for their anti-inflammatory [36], selective COX-2 inhibitor [37] and antimycotic [38] 
and antioxidant [35] activity. 
Regarding the effect of m-substituents, Tetsuto et al. [39] have evaluated the antioxidant activity of 
different donating substituents on a m-substituted phenol, and found that the m-substituent does not 
influence the antioxidant activity of a phenol at all. This is probably because a m-substituent shows 
only a small resonance effect. In contrast to this fact, previous reports found that heterocyclic systems 
with a halogen substituted at the m-position show greater antioxidant properties than those with other 
substituents [40,41]. 
Since we could not find any reports on the use of electron withdrawing groups to enhance the 
antioxidant activity of BHT, therefore, we used MPAO as an effective strategy to enhance the 
antioxidant activity of BHT even if a strong electron withdrawing group (m-fluoro substituent) is a 
basic part of the hybrid molecule. 
In the present study four BHT derivatives have been synthesized. The acid-(base-)catalyzed 
intramolecular dehydrative cyclization reaction of acylthiosemicarbazide 3 to the corresponding  
1,3,4-thiadiazole 4 and 1,2,4-triazole 5 are described. Synthesized compounds have been characterized 
by IR, NMR and mass spectral analysis. X-ray structures of 3 and 4 will be further discussed in this 
paper. Potential biological effects of new compounds were predicted based on structure-activity 
relationships with the PASS software. Antioxidant activities predicted by the PASS program were 
experimentally verified by DPPH and TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substance) assays. 
Furthermore, a computational study for prediction of absorption, distribution (ADMET) [42] properties 
of the synthesized compounds was performed by determination of polar surface area (PSA), absorption 
(ABS) and Lipinski parameters.

2. Results and Discussion 
2.1. Chemistry 
Carboxylic acid 1 (Figure 1) was synthesized according to an established solvent-free procedure [43] 
through the reaction between 2,6-di-tert-butyl-phenol with formaldehyde and thioglycolic acid in the 
presence of di-n-butylamine. Hydrazide 2 (Figure 1) was synthesized using the indirect hydazination 
method through the reaction of 3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxybenzyl chloride with the sodium salt of 
thioglycolic acid hydrazide [44]. 
The synthesis of thiosemicarbazide 3, 1,3,4-thiadiazole 4 and 1,2,4-triazole 5, described in this 
study are outlined in Scheme 1. Acid hydrazide 2 was treated with 3-fluorophenylisothiocyanate to 
give the corresponding acylthiosemicarbazide 3 in good yield. Compound 3 under acidic and basic 
conditions gave thiadiazole 4 and triazole 5, respectively. The structure of the synthesized compounds 
was confirmed based on their physical and spectral data. The structures of compounds 3 and 4 were 
further confirmed by X-ray crystallography.

The IR spectra of all synthesized compounds showed strong absorptions at 3,623–3,653 cm−1, 
attributed to free ν(Ar-O-H). Acylthiosemicarbazide 3 showed NH stretching bands between  
3,285–3,340 cm−1, a C=O stretching band at 1,713 cm−1, and did not show any (S-H) band at 2,570 cm−1, 
while the presence of a C=S stretching band at 1,248 cm−1 indicated that 3 exists in the thione form in 
the solid-state [45,46]. Compound 4 showed two C=N stretching bands at 1,616 and 1,610 cm−1 
attributed to the presence of the thiadiazole ring C=N. Compound 5 did not show any (S-H) band at 
2,570 cm−1, while the presence of C=S stretching band at 1,252 cm−1 indicated that 5 exists in the 
thione form in the solid state [42,43]. 
The 1H-NMR spectra of compound 3, recorded in CDCl3, showed a singlet peak at 8.32 ppm due to 
NH attached to a phenyl group while the other two singlets at 9.26 ppm and 9.84 were attributed to the 
hydrazido group NHs. Both appear as a broad band which supports the formation of intramolecular

hydrogen bonding [45,47] (Figure 3). The disappearance of the NH-1 and NH-2 groups of 3, combined 
with a singlet at 11.75 ppm due to the presence of the NH-triazole of 5 suggest that a 1,2,4-triazole-5-
thione, and not a 1,2,4-triazole-5-thiol was formed.

In the 13C-NMR spectra, the greatest differences between the acylthiosemicarbazide 3 and its cyclic 
derivatives 4 and 5 were found at the carbons designated C-8, C-9 and C-10. For C-8 in 3, this carbon 
was bonded to C-9 (C=O). The electron-withdrawing effects of the oxygen of the C=O greatly 
deshielded the C-8 and caused it to appear at a high chemical shift of 33.76 ppm. After acid  
(base)-catalysed intramolecular dehydrative cyclizations of 3, the carbon at the same position (C-8) in 
4 and 5 were bonded to the new C-9 due to the formation of thiadiazole and thiadiazole rings, respectively, 
so it had a new electronic environment. This greatly lowered the chemical shift of the methylene (C-8) 
to values of 29.96 and 24.68 ppm in 4 and 5, respectively. Interestingly, the heteronuclear 13C-19F 
coupling constants of compounds 3, 4 and 5 were 972, 984 and 1,004 Hz, respectively. 
2.2. Single Crystal X-ray Crystallography of Compounds 3 and 4 
The crystal structure of molecule 3 is depicted in Figure 4 and the selected bond lengths and angles 
are given in Table 1. In the crystal the molecule exists in its thione form. The two methylene carbon 
atoms, C15 and C16, subtend an angle of 100.77 (7) at S1 atom. Several atom pairs of the molecule are 
connected via N-H…O hydrogen bonding (Table 2) in a bifurcated system to form centro-symmetric 
dimers. The hydroxyl group is shielded by the two di-tert-butyl residues and therefore is not involved 
in any hydrogen bonding.

and C1-C6 aromatic rings, respectively. Similar to what was observed in the structure of the 
semicarbazide 3, the hydroxyl group is not involved in any hydrogen bonding as it is shielded by the 
two sterically hindered tert-butyl groups. In the crystal, pairs of N3-H…N2 hydrogen bonds (Table 2) 
link the molecules into centro-symmetric dimers.

2.3. Computational Evaluation of Biological Activity 
The biological activity spectra of the target compounds were obtained using the Prediction of 
Activity Spectra for Substances (PASS) software [48]. PASS prediction tools are constructed using 
20,000 principal compounds from the MDDR database (produced by Accelrys and Prous Science) [49]. 
The database contains over 180,000 biologically relevant compounds and is constantly updated [49]. 
PASS web tool has the ability to predict about 4,000 kinds of biological activity on the basis of 
structural formula with mean accuracy of about 90% [50,51], therefore, it is reasonable to use PASS 
for finding and optimizing new lead compounds. The PASS training set which has been compiled from 
various sources including publications, patents, chemical databases, and “gray” literatures consists of 
over 26,000 biological compounds and includes drugs, lead compounds, drug-candidates, and toxic 
substances. Algorithm of activity spectrum estimation is based on Bayesian approach. The result of 
prediction is presented as the list of activities with appropriate Pa and Pi ratio. Pa and Pi are the 
estimates of probability for the compound to be active and inactive respectively for each type of 
activity from the biological. It is reasonable that only those types of activities may be revealed by the 
compound, which Pa > Pi. If Pa > 0.3 the compound is likely to reveal this activity in experiments, but 
in this case the chance of being the analogue of the known pharmaceutical agents for this compound is 
also high. A portion of the predicted biological activity spectra (lipid peroxidase inhibitor, antioxidant, 
free radical scavenger and antiinflammatory) for the synthesized compounds and BHT are given in 
Table 4.

2.4. Molecular Properties and Drug-Likeness 
2.4.1. Calculation of Drug-Likeness Properties 
Drug-likeness can be defined as a delicate balance between various structural features, which 
determine whether a particular molecule is similar to recognized drugs. It generally means molecules, 
which contain functional groups and/or have physical properties consistent with most of the known 
drugs. These properties are; absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion in the human body like 
a drug. Lipinski [52] used these molecular properties in formulating his Rule of Five. The rule states 
that the most molecules with good membrane permeability have logP < 5, molecular weight <500, 
number of hydrogen bond acceptors <10, number of hydrogen bond donors <5. Number of rotatable 
bonds is important for conformational changes of molecules under study and ultimately for the binding 
with receptors or channels [53]. It is revealed that for passing oral bioavailability criteria, number of 
rotatable bond should be (≤10). The synthesized compounds 1 and 3–5 in general possessed high 
number of rotatable bonds (6–10) and therefore, obviously exhibit large conformational flexibility. 
2.4.2. Lipophilicity 
Generally, lipophilic antioxidants demonstrated more potent scavenging properties than hydrophilic 
antioxidants. Vitamin E is a fat-soluble antioxidant [54]. Distribution of this vitamin within the 
membrane has been shown to alter its antioxidant potency [55]. The Partition Coefficient is a measure 
of how well a substance partitions between a lipid and water. It is therefore important to determine 
these physico-chemical properties associated with an antioxidant activity. LogP measurements (P is 
partition coefficient of the molecule in the water-octanol system) are a useful parameter for use in 
understanding the behaviour of antioxidant molecules. For calculation of logP, we used computed  
logP values by using ADMET predictive software as shown in Table 5. Compounds having logP ≥ 5 
should be considered as a higher lipophilicity have higher permeation across biological membranes 
(but lower aqueous solubility) [56]. The logP values showed that the order of lipophilicity was  
1-acyl-semicarbazide 3 < triazole 5 (thione form) < thiadiazole 4 and 5 (thiol form). Compounds 3–5 
showed lipophilic properties with logP values between 6.439–6.967 while natural lipophilic 
antioxidant, -tocopherol (-TOH) (10.44) and, hydrophilic antioxidant, ascorbic acid (−1.70).

2.4.3. Violations of Lipinski’s Rule of Five 
It is very important to note that there are many violations of this rule among currently existing drugs 
and vice versa, but in general, an orally active drug has no more than one violation. Compounds 
violating more than one of the Lipinski Rules are reasonably assumed to have bioavailability problems 
and are therefore, presumably unsuitable as drugs [57]. However, qualifying the RO5 does not absolute 
guarantee that a molecule is “drug-like” [58]. Moreover, the RO5 says nothing about specific 
chemistry structural features found in drugs or non-drugs [59]. Polar surface area (PSA) is basically 
recognized as a good indicator of drug absorbance in the intestines, Caco-2 monolayers penetration, 
and blood-brain barrier crossing [58]. 
The earlier mentioned parameters were calculated for the BHT derivatives in analysis, and the 
results are depicted in Table 4. From the data obtained, one can notice that the synthesized compounds 
possess an adequate number of proton acceptor and proton donor groups to ensure efficient interaction 
with the hydrogen-bonding groups of the receptors. Hydrogen-bonding capacity has been also 
identified as an important parameter for describing drug permeability [60]. All the BHT derivatives 
were found to violate one of the Lipinski’s parameters (logP ≤ 5), although they have been found to 
have solubility in protic solvents. Magnitude of absorption is expressed by the percentage of 
absorption; Absorption percent was calculated [61] using the equation: % ABS = 109 – (0.345 × PSA). 
Accordingly, to their predictive low PSA (PSA values are considerably less than 90 A2) and high % 
ABS data it seems that this type of antioxidants could have a good capacity for penetrating cell 
membranes [53]. 
2.5. In Vitro Antioxidant Activities 
In present study, antioxidant activities of five BHT derivatives were carried out by two well known 
in vitro antioxidant assays, DPPH and TBARS. The effects of antioxidants in the DPPH-radical-
scavenging test reflects the hydrogen-donating capacity of a compound. In its radical form, DPPH• 
absorbs at 570 nm. The radical form of DPPH is scavenged by an antioxidant through the donation of a 
Molecules 2012, 17 
7654 
 
 
hydrogen atom to form a stable DPPH molecule. This leads to a colour change from purple to yellow, 
and a corresponding decrease in absorbance [62,63]. 
The thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) assay is used for screening and monitoring 
lipid peroxidation. The basis of TBARS assay is the absorbance of a pink coloured complex that is 
monitored spectrophotometrically at 532–535 nm which is formed between thiobarbituric acid and the 
oxidation products of unsaturated lipids [64,65]. 
2.5.1. In Vitro DPPH Free Radical Scavenging Activity 
Compound 3 showed significant levels of % inhibition of DPPH radical compared to the standard 
antioxidant (BHT) used in the study (Table 6). As shown in this Table, thiosemicarbazide 3 exhibited 
strong scavengings effect on DPPH stable radical, with an IC50 value of 68.03 ± 1.27 µM/mL.

This value was lower than that of the thiadiazole 4, triazole 5, BHT and quite close to that of 
ascorbic acid (67.77 ± 0.17 µM/mL), which was used as a positive control in the study, clearly 
indicating that thiosemicarbazide 3 has good radical scavenging activity. Presumably, significantly 
greater inhibition of lipid peroxidation could be attributed to the phenylthiourea system which is the 
active center of antioxidation, acts as the active center of containing thione and secondary aromatic 
amine antioxidants (Figure 6).

This result is in agreement with previous reports whereby thiourea compounds exhibited 
antioxidant activity, while S-alkylation virtually eliminated the antioxidant activity, which indicated 
Molecules 2012, 17 
7655 
 
 
that an unalkylated thiourea group is critical to antioxidant activity. In addition, according to the 
published report, thiosemicarbazide obviously showed greater antioxidant property than triazole and 
thiadiazole [66]. The X-ray structures (Figure 4) and also the 1H-NMR data of 3 revealed that the 
thione form is formed. Thus, the DPPH inhibition result of compound 3 suggested that the thione form 
is largely responsible for the antioxidant activity due to its favourable electron-donating characteristics. 
In addition to that, the active redox center of compound 3 is the Ar-NH- (Figure 6) which increases 
the rate of H-atom transfer to neutralize the DPPH• by delocalization of the nitrogen electron pair over 
the aromatic system and the thione group, forming a stable aminyl radical, thus yielding a DPPH• 
inhibition of 65.21% for 3, while ascorbic acid and BHT gave values of 71.93% and 25.23%, respectively. 
Compound 4 did not show any DPPH radical-scavenging activity compared to BHT and 1. This 
could be attributed to the fact that the electron-withdrawing groups produce a strengthening of the N-H 
bond. This behavior can be attributed to the conjugative effect of the substituents [67,68]. 
Table 6 clearly shown the % inhibition of compound 5 to be higher than BHT and close to that of 
ascorbic acid. Presumably, like 4, the 1,2,4-triazole is present in the thione form as a planar molecule. 
The increased stability of the thione form (I) over thiol form (II) (Scheme 2) has been shown 
theoretically, and the sulfur atom is found to be the atom with largest electron density in the molecule [69]. 
Thus, the chemical behaviour of the system with respect to free radicals would largely depend on the 
tautomeric form present in the reaction, reasonably assuming that the sulfur atom is involved in the 
reactive site. 
Scheme 2. Thione I and thiol II tautomers of 5. 
 
Although we don’t have an exact explanation for the greater activity of 5, we have some logical 
arguments. Heterocyclic systems with halogen substituents have shown greater antioxidant properties 
than other substituents [40,41]. Takanori et al. [70] studied the antioxidant activity of o-benzyl-substituted 
phenols and found that electron-withdrawing groups on benzyl substituent decreases the electron 
density of methylene, making hydrogen transfer to a phenoxy radical easier and regenerated the 
antioxidant activity of phenols. Thus, the fluorine group in compound 5 seemed to enhance free radical 
scavenging by making the NH of triazole ring easy to regenerate reversibly recycling antioxidant 
activity [71] or this might be due to its electron-donating mesomeric effect [39]. 
2.5.2. In Vitro Lipid Peroxidation Activity 
Contrary to the DPPH assay results, compound 3 exhibited the lowest lipid peroxidation activity 
yielding the highest IC50 value of 56 ± 5.05 µM/mL. Compound 4 was higher than BHT, with an IC50 
value of 33.20 ± 2.91 µM/mL. Interestingly, thiadiazole 5 exhibited the strongest inhibitory activity 
with IC50 16.07 ± 3.51 µM/mL (inhibition = 83.99%) which is two times better than the IC50 of  
the standard antioxidant BHT with IC50 = 36.67 ± 1.1.78 µM/mL and close to that of vitamin E

(IC50 = 5.63 ± 1.09 µM/mL, % inhibition = 84.69). It is known that -TOH and BHT are strongly 
lipophilic antioxidants due to their long hydrocarbon chain and di-tert-butyl groups similar to the tail 
of a fatty acid and therefore, reach a higher level of bioavailability [72]. Presumably, the significantly 
greater differences between the lipid peroxidation values of 3, 4 and 5 could be attributed to the 
balance between the hydrophilicity of the polar moieties and the lipophilicity of the hydrocarbon 
moieties. Thus, the stronger inhibitory activity of compound 5 could be attributed to hydrophilic and also 
lipophilic effects on emulsified oils. In emulsions, which is the medium of the TBARS assay, non-polar 
free radical scavengers accumulate in the lipid phase and at the oil-water interface where interactions 
between hydroperoxides at the droplet surface and prooxidants in the aqueous phase occur [73–75]. 
Structurally, in 2010 Imtiaz et al. [76] found triazole derivatives to be relatively more active than 
the derivatives of thiadiazole. These may be regarded as substrate-like inhibitors on the basis of their 
structural similarity with the natural substrate of urease (i.e., urea). Similarly, hydroxyphenylurea 
derivatives exhibit 10 times higher antioxidant activity than -TOH [24]. Thus, results of lipid 
peroxidation inhibition of compound 5 suggested that a 1,2,4-triazole bearing a BHT moiety and  
m-flourophenyl can donate electron/hydrogen easily. However, the m-flouro substituent could also 
enhance the antioxidant activity of BHT similar to donating groups, which could be attributed to its 
electron-donating mesomeric effect [41] but not to the conjugative effect [67,68], and maybe to 
intermolecular lipophilicity effects [77]. 
LogP calculations of 4 and 5 (Table 5) showed the thione form of 5 (logP = 6.84) to have only 
slight more polarity than 4 (logP = 6.94) due to thiol-thione tautomerism effect, which suggested 
compound 4 and 5 to have hydrophilic and lipophilic groups, which may act as amphiphilic 
antioxidants in one molecule rather than having to use two antioxidants separately. Thus, results of 
lipid peroxidation inhibition of compound 5 suggested that it to be possible candidate with promising 
anti-oxidant activities.

solution (1.0 mL, 200 µM in DMSO) was added. 22.03–47.76 mg (1 × 10−4 M) of test compound was 
dissolved in DMSO (1.0 mL, 100%) as a stock solution. This stock solution was then diluted to a range 
of final extraction concentrations 100, 10, 1, 0.1 and 0.01 µM. A negative control with the same DPPH 
concentration in DMSO without sample was used. Each assay was carried out in triplicates. The 
mixture was then incubated in dark for 60 min at room temperature. Absorbance at 570 nm for each 
sample was then measured. Ascorbic acid was used as positive control. The free radical scavenging 
activity of the compounds was calculated as a percentage of radical inhibition by using the formula: 
Percentage of Inhibition (%) = [(Ac − As)/Ac] × 100 
in which As = Absorbance of the compounds/ positive control and Ac = Absorbance of control (DPPH 
solution and DMSO). To determine the concentration required to achieve 50% inhibition (IC50) of DPPH 
radical, the percentage of DPPH inhibition for each compound was plotted against extract concentration. 
3.3.2. Lipid Peroxidation Inhibition Assay 
The lipid peroxidation inhibition assay was carried out according to the reported method with some 
modifications [82]. Fowl egg yolk, comprising mainly of phospholipids, proteins and triacyglycerol, 
was used as an alternative to rat liver microsomes and linoleic acid. The reactive mixture for the 
induction of lipid peroxidation included egg yolk (1.0 mL) emulsified with phosphate buffer saline 
(0.1 M, pH7.4), to a final concentration of 12.5 g/L and 3,000 µM FeSO4 (200 µL). Test compound 
(22.03–47.76 mg, 1 × 10−4 M) was dissolved in DMSO (1.0 mL, 100%) as a stock solution. This stock 
solution was then diluted to a range of final extraction concentrations 100, 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001 µM. 
Each assay was carried out in triplicates. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, after which it 
was treated with freshly prepared trichloracetic acid (TCA, 15%, 0.5 mL) and thiobarbituric acid 
(TBA, 1%, 1.0 mL). The reaction mixtures were then incubated in boiling water for 10 min. Upon 
cooling, the mixtures were centrifuged at 3,500 rpm for 10 min. The formation of TBARS was 
measured by removing 100 µL of supernatant and measuring the absorbance at 532 nm. α-TOH was 
used as positive control. The percentage of inhibition was calculated from the following equation: 
% inhibition = [Ac − As/Ac] × 100 
where As = Absorbance of the compound and Ac = Absorbance of control. 
To determine the concentration required to achieve 50% inhibition (IC50) of phospholipid oxidation 
in egg yolk, the percentage of lipid peroxidation inhibition was plotted against extract concentration. 
4. Conclusions 
Our design strategy involved combining the good features of two or more antioxidants into one 
structure. This strategy was applied in an attempt to significantly improve the antioxidant activities of 
the well-known antioxidant BHT to create novel MPAOs bearing meta electron withdrawing groups. 
We have demonstrated the improvement in the free-radical scavenging capacity of BHT as determined 
by inhibition (25.23%) of DPPH free radical to be more than two-fold. Compound 5 is the most potent 
compound in the in vitro lipid peroxidation and obviously exhibits promising in vitro inhibition of 
Fe2+-induced lipid peroxidation of essential oils. The synthesized compounds 3–5 satisfied Lipinski’s

RO5 and ADMET properties. RO5 and ADMET predictions can be important initial steps toward the 
development of novel pharmaceuticals in the fight against free radicals. Compounds 4 and 5 have 
exactly same molecular weight but different polarity and antioxidant activity, and therefore, PASS and 
MPAO design strategies can be effectively used for finding of compounds with required properties and 
without undesirable side effects. m-Flouro substituents could significantly enhance the antioxidant 
activity of BHT derivatives like other electron donating groups.
