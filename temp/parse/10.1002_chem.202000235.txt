An Isolable Bis(Silanone–Borane) Adduct
Marcel-Philip Luecke, Elron Pens, Shenglai Yao, and Matthias Driess*[a]
Abstract: The reaction of bis(silylenyl)-substituted ferro-
cene 1 with two molar equivalents of BPh3 yields the cor-
responding bis(silylene–borane) Lewis adduct 2. The latter
is capable to activate CO2 to furnish the borane-stabilized
bis(silanone) 3 through mono-oxygenation of the dative
SiII!B silicon centers under release of CO. Removal of
BPh3 from 3 with PMe3 affords the corresponding 1,3,2,4-
cyclodisiloxane and the Me3P@BPh3 adduct. All isolated
new compounds were characterized and their molecular
structures were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffrac-
tion analyses.
The activation of small molecules using non- and semi-metal-
based compounds is an attractive field in main-group chemis-
try which led to the discovery of new activation modes and
types of reactions.[1] In this context, the concept of frustrated
Lewis pairs (FLPs) for cooperative activation of inert bonds em-
ploying Lewis acids and bases, firstly reported by Stephan,
Erker and co-workers, is a landmark discovery.[2] Since then, the
rapid expansion of FLP chemistry has paved the way to differ-
ent inter- and intramolecular systems in which the majority is
based on sterically encumbered phosphorus- and nitrogen-
centered Lewis bases and organoboranes as Lewis acids.[3] Al-
though divalent carbon species such as N-heterocyclic car-
benes (NHCs) have also been successfully probed in FLP
chemistry for the activation of CO2, H2 and N2O, the use of
analogous Lewis pairs-containing silylenes is less known.[4,5]
The silicon(II) atom in silylenes exhibits an ambiphilic character
due to its vacant 3p orbital (LUMO) and the 3s-centered lone
pair (HOMO). Owing to their interesting property and reactivity,
stable N-heterocyclic silylenes (NHSis), the heavier analogues
of NHCs, have been utilized successfully for the metal-free acti-
vation of small molecules[6] and as powerful steering ligands in
homogeneous catalysis.[7] After the first isolation of an N-heter-
ocyclic silylene in 1994 by Denk and West, the formation of a
silylene–borane adduct was reported two years later, which,
however, slowly rearranges to a silylborane through SiII inser-
tion into the B@C bond of B(C6F5)3.[8] Since then, an increasing
number of compounds containing a dative SiII!BIII bond with
four- and five- coordinate SiII centers have been isolated and
structurally characterized.[9]
Due to a large polarization of the Si=O bond and the re-
markably weak Si@O p bond (58.5 kJmol@1) compared to the
Si@O s-bond strength (119.7 kJmol@1), compounds with a Si=O
bond are intrinsically susceptible to auto-oligomerization to
the corresponding polysiloxanes.[10] Thus, introduction of an
electron donor at the Si atom or/and an acceptor at the O
atom are needed to disfavor head-to-tail oligomerization of
the polar Si=O bond.[11] This led to the first Lewis acid-base
supported
silanone
complex,
the
silaformamide–borane A
(Scheme 1), which was reported by us in 2007, starting from a
silylene and H2O·B(C6F5)3.[12] Roesky et al. described in 2011 the
isolation of the acid anhydride B generated from the reaction
of a chlorosilylene with H2O·B(C6F5)3 in the presence of NHC.[13]
Similarly, Roesky et al. reported also the silaformyl chloride
complex C, resulting from an NHC-stabilized silylene and
H2O·B(C6F5)3.[14] In 2019, the isolation of the first donor–accept-
or-supported silaaldehyde D was accomplished by the Inoue
group.[15] Remarkably, Kippings dream of isolable genuine sila-
nones was realized in 2014 with the isolation of the first metal-
losilanone by Filippou[16] and 2017 by the groups of Inoue and
Rieger.[17] Very recently, a silicon analogue of a ketone with an
unperturbed Si=O bond was synthesized by Iwamoto and co-
workers.[18]
Starting from an in situ generated silylene–borane adduct,
Teng et al. reported in 2016 on the activation of THF leading
to the isolation of a corresponding ring-opening product.[20]
Recently, Braun and co-workers used a silylene–borane Lewis
adduct as a tool for trapping a single water molecule, affording
a zwitterionic silanol stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen
bonds.[23] In 2017, our group reported the first intramolecular
silylene–borane FLP which activates H2, O2, CO2 and even dehy-
drogenates water yielding a borane-stabilized silanone E with
a dative Si=O!B bond.[19] Herein, we present the synthesis of
the bis(silylene–borane) adduct 2 with the ferrocene spacer
and its mild oxidation with CO2 yielding the first borane-stabi-
lized bis(silanone) adduct 3. Removal of BPh3 from 3 by addi-
tion of PMe3 leads to the corresponding 1,3,2,4-cyclodisiloxane
through intramolecular Si=O head-to-tail dimerization. More-
over, the reaction of 2 with elemental sulfur yields a bis(sila-
thione) with two ‘borane-free’ Si=S moieties.

temperature leads to the formation of the bis(silylene-borane)
adduct 2 which was isolated in 74% yields as a red crystalline
solid (Scheme 2). The identity of 2 was proven by elemental
analysis, single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis and multinu-
clear NMR spectroscopy in the solid state and in solution. Crys-
tals suitable for an X-ray diffraction analysis were obtained in a
concentrated toluene solution of 2 at @308C, the crystals are a
mixture of the two rotational conformers (Figure 1; see also
the Supporting Information).
Compound 2 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group
P121/c1 in which both silicon centers adopt a distorted tetrahe-
dral geometry (8Si1=356.728, 8B1=319.808) with Si@B distan-
ces of 2.089(2) and 2.077(2) a, similar to those of related silico-
n(II)–boranes adducts (1.9624(5)–2.108(2) a).[9] Given the low
solubility of 2 in deuterated benzene and THF, only a broad
29Si NMR signal of low intensity was observed at d=54.0 ppm
which is low-field shifted compared to 1 (d=43.3 ppm). The
solid-state 29Si NMR (VACP/MAS) spectrum of 2 shows
a singlet at d=48.6 ppm (1: d=41.6 ppm). The iso-
tropic 11B chemical shift was observed in [D8]THF sol-
utions at d=@7.8 ppm (Dn1/2=356 Hz) which is, as
expected, low-field shifted due to its coordination to
the SiII center (BPh3: d(11B)=55.2 ppm, C6D6).[9]
Compound 2 is inert towards H2 and CO but reacts
with CO2 in C6D6 under ambient conditions (1 bar,
298 K), resulting in the simultaneous formation of a
pale-yellow solid and CO as confirmed by an addi-
tional 13C-labeling experiment (See the Supporting In-
formation, S11). Resolving the solid in [D8]THF and re-
cording its multinuclear NMR spectra revealed the
formation of a new species with a strongly high-field
shifted 29S NMR singlet resonance at d=@44.7 ppm
(2: d=+54.1 ppm). An X-ray diffraction analysis of
single crystals revealed the formation of the borane-
stabilized bis(silanone) 3, was isolated in 94% yields
(Figure 2).

The silicon center in 3 adopts a distorted tetrahedral geome-
try with a short Si@O distance of 1.557(4) and 1.537(4) a in ac-
cordance with related four-coordinated Lewis acid stabilized si-
lanones
(1.531–1.579 a)
containing
a
Si=O
double
bond.[12–15,19,21–22] The Si@O distance is only slightly elongated
when compared with recently reported genuine silanones
(1.518–1.537 a).[15–18] Bis(silanone) 3 is remarkable stable in so-
lution ([D8]THF) and no changes in the 1H NMR spectra were
observed upon heating to 608C. Compound 3 represents a
rare example of borane-stabilized silanones. Aldridge and co-
workers achieved the isolation of a stabilized silaaldehyde
through chloride–hydride substitution using K[HBEt3].[21] Addi-
tion of B(C6F5)3 to a cyclic amino(bora-ylide(silanone)) reported
by Kato et al., increased the stability of the pre-formed free si-
lanone.[22] In the presence of B(C6F5)3, Roesky et al. accom-
plished the isolation of a donor–acceptor stabilized silaformyl
chloride.[14] However, isolation of a borane-stabilized silanone
starting from a silylene–borane system is not reported so far.
To remove the boranes from the bis(silanone–borane) com-
plex 3, trimethylphosphane (PMe3, 5 equiv) was added. This re-
sulted in the clean formation of the corresponding Lewis pair
Me3P!BPh3 (31P NMR: @15.3 ppm) and the 1,3,2,4-cyclodisilox-
ane 4 (head-to-tail dimer of Si=O moieties). The latter is identi-
cal with the isolated product from the reaction of 1 with CO2
in 76% yields (Scheme 2). Single crystals of 4 suitable for X-ray
diffraction analysis were obtained from a concentrated solution
in a 1:1 benzene/hexane mixture at room tempera-
ture (Figure 3). The formation of Me3P!BPh3 was ad-
ditionally confirmed by a single-crystal X-ray analysis
obtained in the reaction mixture of 3 and PMe3 in
THF solutions (see the Supporting Information).
As expected, the five-coordinate silicon centers in
4 show a drastically high-field shifted 29Si NMR chemi-
cal shift at d=@92.1 ppm (3: d=@44.7 ppm). The
Si@O distance of 1.709(4) and 1.681(4) a are elongat-
ed compared to those observed for 3 (1.557(4), 1.537(4) a) in
accordance with the presence of Si@O single bonds.[25] Reac-
tion of 4 with an excess amount of BPh3 in toluene at room
temperature does not regenerate 3.
Interestingly, reaction of the bis(silylene–borane) 2 with
10 equivalents of PMe3 led to the formation of a new species
2’ in the course of borane-deprotection of one SiII moiety in 2
(Scheme 3, see the Supporting Information). This process is re-
versible because removal of the solvent and PMe3 in vacuum
and re-dissolving of the residue in C6D6 furnishes compound 2
as shown by NMR spectroscopy.
In contrast to the oxygenation of 2 with CO2, treatment of 2
with elemental sulfur in toluene at room temperature leads to
the selective formation of the ‘borane-free’ bis(silathione) 5.
Compound 5 is identical with the product from the reaction of
bis(silylene) 1 with elemental sulfur in toluene at room temper-
ature, which was isolated in 54% yield (Scheme 4). Similar to
the product of an intramolecular silylene–borane FLP with ele-
mental sulfur reported by our group,[19] no Si=S!B interaction
was observed. The structure of 5 (Figure 4) features two Si=S
bonds with a low-field shifted singlet 29Si NMR signal at d=
12.1 ppm. The Si=S distances of 1.9867(13) and 1.9858(13) a
are consistent with related silathiones with four-coordinate sili-
con atoms [{PhC(NtBu)2}Si(S)Cl] (2.079(6) a) and as reported for
a Si=S product from sulfuration of an intramolecular silylene–
borane FLP with elemental sulfur (1.9795(10) a).[19,26] Bis(sila-
thione) 5 is stable in C6D6 solutions over a period of several
weeks which can be explained by a less polarized Si=S bond
(DEN=0.7) compared to the Si=O bond (DEN=1.7) based on
their electronegativities (EN).
In summary, the synthesis of bis(silylene-borane) Lewis
adduct 2 containing two SiII–BPh3 moieties in a single molecule
was presented. Exposure of 2 to CO2 yields the corresponding

rization. In contrast, the reaction of 2 with elemental sulfur
yields exclusively the borane-free bis(silathione) 5 which shows
no tendency to undergo dimerization.
