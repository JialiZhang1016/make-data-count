Abstract
Field observations on small rivers of the Amazon basin are less common due to their
remote location and difficult accessibility. Here we show, through remote sensing
analysis and field works, the planform evolution and riverbed topography of a small
river located in the upper foreland Amazon basin, the Ichilo River. By tracking plan-
form changes over 30 years, we identified the factors that control meander migration
rates in the Ichilo River: cutoffs, climate and human interventions. The data suggest
that neck cutoffs are the main controls in the Ichilo River, with an annual density of
0.022 cutoffs/km. In addition, climate controls have been identified in the form of
high-precipitation events that may have promoted cutoffs, an increase in meander
migration rate and channel widening. The width distribution of the Ichilo River is well
represented by general extreme value and inverse Gaussian distributions. The spatio-
temporal variability of meandering migration rates in the Ichilo River is analysed in
two locations where neck cutoffs are expected. Analysing the distance across the
neck in these two points, we predict the occurrence of a new cutoff. The combined
methodology of bathymetric surveys and structure from motion photogrammetry
shows us the Ichilo riverbed topography and banks at high resolution, where two
scour holes were identified. Finally, we discuss the impact of planform changes of
the Ichilo River on communities that are established along its riverbanks.

INTRODUCTION
The Amazon basin exhibits a constantly changing landscape modified
by the rivers that flow through its floodplains. There, we can find
many of the fastest meandering rivers in the world, where cutoffs,
oxbow lakes and meandering scars are evidence of the evolution that
these rivers have experienced over time.
Numerous riverine communities have been established along
meandering rivers of the Amazon basin. These communities depend
on the abundant natural resources available, where their main eco-
nomic activities include fishery, agriculture and navigation. Although
riverine communities show a strong dependency on river activity
(Lombardo, 2016), the morphodynamics of meandering rivers are also
affected by human activity, even changing their planform shape and
bend meander migration rates (Schwenk & Foufoula-Georgiou, 2016).
However, it is not only human-induced activities that affect the plan-
form configuration of this meandering system, but also natural pertur-
bations. A meander neck cutoff is a natural perturbation that occurs
when the river intersects itself (Schwenk & Foufoula-Georgiou, 2016;
Schwenk et al., 2015), modifying its current planform configuration.
Bend development and sinuosity growth are limited by the occurrence
of cutoffs (Van Dijk, 2013). Previous studies have demonstrated that
neck cutoffs heavily influence the development of meandering rivers
in terms of planform shape, hydraulics and sedimentology, both in the
short and long term (Camporeale et al., 2008; Li et al., 2020;
Schwenk & Foufoula-Georgiou, 2016).

Different approaches have been used to understand, quantify and
model meandering rivers in the Amazon basin. Researchers have
exploited the potential of remote sensing (Gomes et al., 2018;
Lombardo, 2016; Schwenk & Foufoula-Georgiou, 2016; Schwenk
et al., 2017), field works and numerical models to study the planform
morphodynamics of these rivers. Each methodology, with its advan-
tages and limitations, highlights the importance of integrating differ-
ent approaches in a complementary way to investigate meandering
rivers whenever possible (Van Dijk, 2013).
Most of the research carried out in the Amazon basin is concen-
trated on the main tributaries of the Amazon River (Lombardo, 2016),
while the number of studies in small rivers is limited, especially in the
upper foreland Amazon basin, due to their remote location and diffi-
cult accessibility. However, a large part of the Amazon network is
composed of ‘small rivers’ (Strahler stream order less than 7)
(Lombardo, 2016). Meandering rivers in the upper Amazon basin that
are located close to the Andes range have interesting characteristics,
such as hydrological cycles with numerous peaks around the year
(even in the low season), short inundation periods and high sediment
transport, regardless of their low discharge when compared to rivers
of the central and low Amazon basin (Lombardo, 2016; Rejas, 2018).
There is a need to understand the morphodynamics of rivers in the
upper foreland Amazon basin.
This paper explores the planform morphodynamics and bed
topography of the Ichilo River, a small meandering river in the upper
part of the Bolivian Amazon basin, in order to identify controls on
meander migration and planform evolution, such as neck cutoffs,
climate and anthropogenic interventions. We discuss bank erosion
and bank accretion processes, the spatial variation of the meander
migration rates and future planform evolution of the Ichilo River. Also,
we discuss how changes in the river have and will impact the riverine
communities established on the Ichilo River.
Our study is divided into two parts. In the first part, the temporal
and spatial evolution of the Ichilo River is studied using remote sens-
ing analysis for a period of 30 years in order to understand the plan-
form morphodynamics of the river.
In the second part, we present the results of two field campaigns
that were performed in order to collect bathymetric data using a mul-
tibeam echosounder (MBES) and investigate bank and bed erosion
processes using structure from motion (SfM) photogrammetry. Finally,
the results are analysed together, and we discuss the planform
changes during the last 30 years and the future planform develop-
ment of the Ichilo River, with emphasis on the impact it may cause on
the inhabitants of its riverbanks.

AREA OF STUDY
The Ichilo River belongs to the upper part of the Amazon basin in
Bolivia. It serves as a natural border between the departments of
Santa Cruz and Cochabamba (Figure 1). The Ichilo River meanders
from south to north from the Andes range to the Bolivian savannah
forest. The river reach of the Ichilo presents a single-thread
meandering
configuration
that
starts
almost
immediately
after

leaving the Andes mountains, where the alluvial plain starts, and
the steep of the terrain decreases noticeably (Peters, 1998). The
Ichilo River has many tributaries, such as the Vibora, Izozog,
Isarzama and Sajta rivers, among others. The Sajta is an important
tributary because it connects with the Ichilo near the city of Puerto
Villarroel. The
Ichilo
River
and
its
tributaries end
up
in
the
Mamorecillo River and continue flowing, until they become the
Mamoré River. The Ichilo River is the Andean tributary of the
Mamore River, which later joins the Madeira River and then
reaches the Amazon.
The Ichilo River is characterized as being an active migrating river
with
high
sinuosity.
Cutoffs,
oxbow
lakes,
paleochannels
and
meandering scars from old paths of the Ichilo River remain as testi-
mony of this behaviour.
Recently, the study of Lombardo (2016) has reported annual aver-
age migration rates of 0.034 channel widths/year, and an average
annual width of 134.2±19.35 m for the Ichilo River. The water levels
in the Ichilo River show high variability, where peaks are observed
even during the dry season (June to October), when water levels are
the lowest (Figures 2a–c).
Water level data were analysed and the statistics of the annual
water levels are presented in Figure 2b. The dataset consists of
31 years of daily water levels, ranging from 1988 to 2019.
Figure 2b presents three sets of data: (1) the annual maximum
water level (blue asterisks); (2) the annual minimum water level (red
dots); and (3) the mean annual water level (yellow squares). The
data show that water levels each year decreased below the 2 m
level and reached values higher than 6 m. The maximum water
levels exceeded the flooding level (7.83 m) affecting the city of
Puerto Villarroel with inundations in the years 2019–2016, 2014,
2013, 2010–2007, 2003, 1995 and 1992 (Figure 3). The water level
data are collected at the port by local institutions (Servicio de
Mejoramiento de la Navegación Amazónica-SEMENA); data are
available upon request at https://www.semena.gob.bo/.

From 1988 to 2018, a total of 10 cutoffs were observed in a
length of around 150 km of the Ichilo River, which indicates a density
of 0.022 cuttoffs/km per year. One of these cutoffs corresponds to a
human-induced cutoff designed by Peters (1998) in order to avoid a
natural cutoff (Figure 4a), expected to occur during the year
1996–1997. The objective of this human-induced cutoff was to pro-
tect a port (Puerto Villarroel) that had been constructed in the banks
of the Ichilo River and remains there today (Figure 4b). In terms of
area, this cutoff is the largest observed during the studied period.

METHODOLOGY
Here, a combination of remote sensing analysis and field measure-
ments was used to study the active meandering behaviour of the
Ichilo River. The remote sensing analysis corresponded to a spatial
and temporal analysis for a period of 30 years (1988–2018). Field data
were acquired during two field campaigns performed at the Ichilo
River during the rainy season in February and May 2019, respectively.
During
the
first
campaign,
orthophotos
were
collected
using
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and a pocket erodometer test (PET)
was performed on the banks of the Ichilo River to check the erodibil-
ity of the bank material. The second campaign (May) had the objective
of performing a bathymetric survey using a MBES complemented
with SfM.

History of Ichilo River from satellite imagery
Satellite imagery of the area of study of the Ichilo River was down-
loaded from Landsat 5 (L5) and Landsat 8 (L8) using the Google Earth
Engine (GEE) (Gorelick et al., 2017). The analysis started upstream in
the confluence of the Ichilo River with the Izozog River and continued
150 km along the Ichilo River until the confluence with the Chapare
River (Figure 1).
The analysis period was from 1988 to 2018, a period of 30 years,
and we tried to obtain imagery at an annual time scale. However, in all
years, most of the imagery was partially or totally covered by cloud,
especially during the rainy season (November to May). The classifica-
tion and the creation of channel masks was performed similarly to in
Schwenk et al. (2017).
3.1.1

Classification of satellite imagery
Each year the satellite imagery was analysed, searching for cloud-free
images for the area of study for the period of low flow (from June to
October), except in 2008, when we used an image from the month of
November. Only cloud-free images were considered in the analysis,
and the dataset used for the analysis is shown in Table 1.
The main objective of the imagery analysis was to obtain a
well-defined full channel mask of the river for each year. Each
image was classified using a support vector machine (SVM) classifi-
cation model using the GGE. The classification of the imagery
followed three steps: training data, classifying and assessment. The
first step consisted of collecting training data of the known pixel

classes in each imagery: water, vegetation and sediment. Then, the
classification was performed using a SVM classification model. After
the classification, a cleaning process was performed manually fol-
lowing the methodology of Schwenk et al. (2017). As a result of
the classification, we obtained binary images with a defined chan-
nel, and the information was used as input for the analysis of the
planform metrics.
3.1.2

Planform analysis
The analysis of the planforms was performed using the RivMAP (River
Morphodynamics from Analysis of Planforms) toolbox (Schwenk
et al., 2017). RivMAP consists of a combination of MATLAB codes
based on the image-processing morphological operations offered by
MATLAB (Schwenk et al., 2017). This toolbox was developed to calcu-
late the metrics of meandering rivers from channel masks as input.
The
following
information
was
quantified
with
the
toolbox:
centrelines, banklines, river widths, migrated areas, cutoffs, erosion
and accretion rates (see Schwenk et al., 2017 for more information on
the RivMAP toolbox).
In addition, the extracted river widths along the Ichilo River were
analysed in order to assess their spatiotemporal distribution. In gen-
eral, a general extreme value (GEV) distribution provides the best data
fit for width sequences in meandering rivers (Lopez Dubon &
Lanzoni, 2019). For each year, different probability distribution func-
tions (PDFs) were tested to fit the annual histograms of the dimen-
sionless widths and the most appropriate function was selected using
a Bayesian information criterion (BIC), as suggested by Lopez Dubon
and Lanzoni (2019).

Field measurements
As mentioned before, two field surveys were performed during
February and May 2019 to acquire data. During the first field cam-
paign (February 2019) we used a UAV to capture orthophotos along
one bend of the Ichilo River where a cutoff is expected (#F1). The
objective of this campaign was to identify areas of bank erosion by
taking orthophotos with the UAV and assess the location in order to
perform a second, more complete field campaign. Also, field measure-
ments of the erodibility of the bank in the Ichilo River were made
using a PET (Briaud et al., 2012). This method provides an idea of the
soil erodibility using small, inexpensive apparatus that was easy to
carry to the location.
The methodology consisted of shooting a horizontal jet of water
into the vertical face of the bank using a mini jet pulse device (a water
gun pistol, Figure 5a).
Pulses of water were squeezed at an interval of 1 s, with a repeti-
tion of 20 times. The depth of the hole was measured using a digital
calliper (Figure 5b).
The procedure was repeated four times along the bank, and then
the measured depth was introduced in the PET table (from Briaud
et al., 2012) to determine the erodibility category of the soil among
five categories: very high erodibility (I); high erodibility (II); medium
erodibility (III); low erodibility (IV); and very low erodibility (V). The
results of the test in the Ichilo River are shown in Table 2. The PET
erosion category was II, showing a soil of high erodibility (15–75 mm).
The detailed methodology of the PET is described in Briaud
et al. (2012).
During the second field campaign, topographic data from the
banks were obtained by applying SfM photogrammetry. We surveyed
the banks using a DJI Phantom 4 Pro and a DJI Mavic Pro was used
for taking pictures. Details of the equipment, survey design and exe-
cution, and other details, are shown below as suggested in James
et al. (2019). The Phantom 4 Pro is equipped with a FC6310S camera
that uses a 1-inch CMOS sensor at 20 megapixels with an aperture
range from F2.8 to F11 and a 24 mm equivalent focal length. The
image size was 5472 × 3648. The nominal flight height was around
181.4 m, and the ground sample distance was 5 cm with a front and
side overlap ratio of 80 and 75%, respectively. Before taking the imag-
ery, we marked ground control points (GCPs) along the banks, wher-
ever access to the area was possible, in order to georeference the
digital elevation model (DEM). The GCPs were white crosses (around
1 m size), marked using latex painting and easily visible in the aerial
imagery. A total of 44 GCPs were marked along the riverbanks and
their coordinates measured using a real-time kinematic (RTK) GPS
unit. After the GCPs were marked, the UAVs were launched and pic-
tures taken including the GCPs; a total of 1358 pictures were taken
during the surveys. The imagery was analysed and processed using
Agisoft PhotoScan software, which compares the imagery and finds
homologous points in each picture. The GCPs were split into two
groups: the first group with 30 GCPs was used to correct the imagery;

the second with 14 GCPs was used to assess the accuracy of the
imagery. The processed imagery taken in May resulted in orthophotos
and a DEM covering around 350 hectares of terrain. The mean posi-
tional errors of the 14 reserved GCPs were 0.003, 0.004 and 0.06 m
in the x, y and z directions, respectively.
Underwater features of the Ichilo River were measured through
bathymetric surveys. An interferometric MBES and an inertial navi-
gation system (INS) was attached to a boat and surveyed along
14 km of the Ichilo River and 2 km of its tributary, the Sajta River.
The data can be accessed through the U.S. Geological Survey
(USGS) data release website (Kinzel et al., 2019), which includes
survey point data (in metres) in Universal Transverse Mercator Zone
20 South. The DEM was created at 1 m resolution and was com-
bined with the DEM obtained from the UAV surveys to obtain
cross-sections of the river.
Additionally, soil samples were taken at two point bars in the
river, and values for the mean grain size were obtained.

RESULTS

Mechanisms of meander migration
Figure 6 serves as evidence of the changing nature of the Ichilo River,
showing the paths where the river used to flow through the last
30 years. Moreover, it helps us to identify the location of the migrated
areas and the occurrence of cutoffs. As expected in a meandering river,
the planform shape indicates that the erosion area was larger in the
concave parts of the bends, while the deposition area was observed in
their inner part. Furthermore, cutoffs were identified and shown in a
detailed zoom (Figure 6). Although we observed both chute cutoffs and
neck cutoffs, the dominant type of cutoff in the Ichilo River was the
neck cutoff (Figures 6 and 7), with a total of 10 neck cutoffs in our stud-
ied area. The largest cutoff in terms of area observed in the Ichilo River
corresponds to a human-induced cutoff (cutoff #9, Figures 6 and 7),
located near the confluence with the Sajta River.
The annual reach-averaged migration rates of the Ichilo River for
the analysed period are presented in Figure 8. The reach considered
in the calculations corresponds to the river length shown in Figure 6.
An increase in migration rates is observed from 2005, with a peak
occurring in 2008. The spike in migration rates measured after 2005
seems to correlate with the occurrence of many cutoffs. Four cutoffs
were observed between 2007 and 2010, together with an increase in
the annual averaged river width as observed in Figure 8b. Again, after
2014–2015 two cutoffs were observed and also correlate with
increases in the annual averaged river width.
From November 2007 to April 2008, Bolivia suffered a severe sea-
son of flooding where the city of Puerto Villarroel was affected by La
Niña events. The data indicate that the Ichilo River remained flooded
for 5 days in January 2008, with water levels over bank level (>7.8 m).
Another event of high precipitation was registered in 2014, when water
levels remained over bank level for almost 23 days, being the largest
event registered in the 30-year period. It is possible that the high mean-
der migration rates in 2008 were related to the high-precipitation event
occurring in that year, and this could have triggered the development of
the cutoffs that were observed in the following years.
Similar to the event of 2008, the high precipitation observed in
2014 seemed to have promoted the occurrence of cutoffs and
increased the river width, but no change in meander migration rates
was observed.
Furthermore, the maximum annual stage (Smax) was plotted
against the annual averaged migration rate (Mrcl) (Figure 9a), and the
results show a small to moderate correlation (R2 = 0.16).
Two points in the Ichilo River, cutoff #F1 and cutoff #F2 (see
location in Figure 7) were identified to be susceptible to the occur-
rence of a cutoff. We compared the evolution of the distance before
cutoff occurrence in both sections using satellite imagery and
orthophotos (Figure 9b). The graph indicates that the distance across
the neck of #F1 decreased at a faster rate than in #F2. The distance
across the neck in #F1 decreased by 87.4% of the initial distance
(761.7 m) in 1988, while the neck distance in #F2 decreased 47.8%

Spatiotemporal distribution of channel
widths
Lopez Dubon and Lanzoni (2019) discussed how width fluctuations
can be described by a GEV probability distribution. In the case of the
Ichilo River we applied many PDFs and found that a GEV distribution
is the best fit for the period 1988–2013, while from years 2014 to
2018 an inverse Gaussian distribution represents the variation of the
data better. An example of the analysis of the histograms and the
fitted PDFs for years 1988 and 2018 is shown in Figure 11.
The annual PDFs of the Ichilo River in the studied period are pres-
ented in Figure 12a. In the period of Figure 12b, three cutoffs were
observed in years 2008, 2009 and 2010, and in Figure 12c cutoffs
occurred in years 2014 and 2015. The main changes in the PDFs
occurred in years with cutoffs, while in years without cutoffs
(2016–2018) the PDFs’ shape remained similar.

Bank erosion and bed topography
Bends in the Ichilo River are characterized by stable vertical cutbanks,
constituted of a mixture of cohesive material and fine sand. The PET

area near the port (Figure 13b). Upstream the confluence of the Ichilo
River with the Sajta River, the floodplain is covered by a dense forest
(Figure 13a). The inner part of the bends is mainly constituted of fine
sand, where the vegetation is composed of small bushes. The struc-
ture of the points bar is presented in Figures 13c and d. Excavations
made in situ showed two layers of material deposited and clearly sepa-
rated by a small layer of finer material. Two sediment samples were
taken in the Ichilo River with the following mean grain size D50:
0.106 mm (sample 1) and 0.210 mm (sample 2). The location where
the samples were taken is presented in Figure 14. Furthermore,
Figure 14 shows the measurements of the bed topography with the
MBES and the orthophotos collected during the second field survey.
Both measurements are in good agreement. In Figure 15, the data
from the UAVs and the MBES bathymetry were combined in order to
obtain cross-sectional profiles of the banks of the Ichilo River, show-
ing high consistency between the results of the UAVs and the sonar.
Some areas could not be surveyed because the boat could not reach
these locations due to shallow water and the presence of vegetation
that obstructed access. The maximum water depth retrieved during
the measurements was around 14 m near the area of the port.
Another point of interest was located downstream of the confluence,
where the difference in riverbed elevation of the Ichilo and Sajta riv-
ers was around 10 m (Figures 14 and 15, section C–C0).
Bank failures were observed all along the Ichilo riverbanks
(Figure 15). In general, mass failures are concentrated in areas where
the hydrodynamic conditions and topographic and geotechnical prop-
erties of the banks induce mass failures (Motta et al., 2014), particu-
larly in the bend apex where outer banks with cohesive materials are
steeper and taller, such as in the case of the Ichilo River.
There are different factors that influence the shear stress distri-
bution on banks in meandering bends, such as secondary flow
strength, bank slope, width-to-depth ratio, difference in roughness
between bed and planform evolution (Motta et al., 2014). Flow in a
cross-sectional bend is directed from the inner bank (bar) towards the
outer bank (pools) due to the topography of the riverbed. Whenever
this effect is strong, the locus of maximum flow velocity occurs
towards the outer bank, leading to bank retreat due to continued
action of erosion of the bank. The eroded material, depending on the
size and discharge of the river, can remain in front of the bank, as
observed in some cross-sections of the Ichilo River. If the deformation
is prominent, the locus of maximum flow velocity occurs over the
pools close to the banks. Direct action of the flow on the bank in
these regions leads to bank retreat trough continuous erosion of the
bank (Ferreira da Silva & Ebrahimi, 2017). In the Ichilo River, bed ero-
sion in the outer bank downstream of the channel apex of bend #F1
(Figure 14d) indicates a full development of secondary flow.
In addition, changes in the bed profile of the river can be better
appreciated in (Figure 15), where two deep holes were observed, one
corresponding to the location of the confluence and the other
corresponding to the area of the port. The slope of the river calculated
from the profile in Figure 15 was S = 0.00022.

DISCUSSION
This research highlights the need for field works combined with spa-
tiotemporal satellite imagery analysis to study the planform dynamics
of small meandering rivers such as the Ichilo. The results from the sat-
ellite imagery allowed us to identify the neck cutoffs as main controls
on the planform evolution of the Ichilo River. In addition, the analysis
of two bends of the Ichilo River (#F1 and #F2) has shown the spatial
variability of the migration rates and the interaction between bends
under similar hydraulic conditions. Further changes in the planform
shape of these bends of the Ichilo River are likely to happen in the
short term. We expect the development of cutoff #F1 for several rea-
sons. First, the distance across the neck in #F1 has been decreasing at
a higher rate than in #F2 due to the growth of the point bar, which
narrows the channel and increases the velocity of the flow towards
the outer bank (bar push theory) (van de Lageweg et al., 2014). The
satellite imagery showed that the point bar in #F1 is bigger than the
point bar in #F2. In addition, in the case of #F1, the neck is experienc-
ing erosion from both sides due to the skewness of the bend and the

geometry of the channel, while erosion in #F2 is occurring mainly on
one side. The bathymetric data confirm this information, where in the
case of #F1 the erosion is observed along both sides of the neck,
while in the case of #F2 the erosion concentrates downstream of the
neck. As the distance across the neck decreases, intra-meandering
flow inside the banks may increase from one bank and that could
accelerate the process.
Planform evolution depends on the magnitude and duration of
the high and low flow discharges (Asahi et al., 2013). In the Ichilo
River, we observed high variability in water levels. It is expected that
the river behaves differently during increasing and decreasing of the
discharge, affecting the accretion and erosion processes. High and
lower flows seem to govern bank accretion, where vertical accretion
occurs during floods and transverse point bar accretion during the fail-
ing stage and normal flows (Crosato, 2008). Also, heavy precipitation
may trigger mass failures along the banks due to positive pore pres-
sures
that
reduce
the
effective
friction
angle
in
the
banks
(Thorne, 1991). During our field works we observed mass failures
along the banks which corresponded to a low flow state. In our study,
annual migration rates showed a correlation with higher water levels
in the river. A similar effect was observed by Schwenk et al. (2017) in
his analysis of the Ucayali River and by Gautier et al. (2010) in the

Beni River. The higher annual migration rates in the year 2008 coin-
cided with La Niña years, which affected Bolivia with extreme precipi-
tation events. The city of Puerto Villarroel suffered inundations from
the Ichilo River that lasted 5 days. As inundation periods in the Ichilo
River are usually shorter, a large period of inundation may have
affected the strength in the banks, triggering bank failures along the
river. In addition, another much larger high-precipitation event was
observed in 2014, where the river remained inundated for 23 days
and, in the following years, two cutoffs were observed. Human-
induced cutoffs observed in the Ichilo and Sajta rivers illustrate the
impact of human intervention in the planform development of the
Ichilo River. The case of cutoff #9, the human-induced cutoff, as a
response to a natural neck cutoff that threatened the safety of the
port infrastructure, consisted in the design of a new alignment for the
Ichilo River and its tributary (Peters, 2009). This design considered a
mild curvature at the confluence of the Sajta and Ichilo rivers in order
to avoid the generation of secondary flows that would promote bank
erosion in Ichilo riverbanks (Peters, 2009) and the cutoff in the Ichilo
River. If the natural meander cutoff had developed, the port would
have been left in the abandoned path (oxbow lake), eventually becom-
ing useless (Peters, 1998); and the current planform shape of the
Ichilo River would have changed to a different configuration.
In addition, areas where the river is stable and has not migrated in
the period of our investigation were identified. The inactivity of these
areas may be related to the planform spatial variability due to geologi-
cal reasons (Peters, 1998). For example, the area between the port
and the intersection with the Sajta River has maintained the original
planform shape since 1988 with minor modifications, even though the
PET showed that the bank material is highly erodible, and according
to Peters (1998), this may be the reason why the inhabitants in earlier
times decided on that location to establish the port. However, even
though only minor planform changes were observed in this area, the
high-resolution bathymetric data showed scour holes in the bed
topography in the area near the port and near the confluence with the
Sajta River. The collapse of the platform of the port at the location of
the scour hole, in September 2019, showed that the bed topography
is also changing. The confluence with the Sajta River affects the river-
bed morphology, as shown by the formation of the scour hole down-
stream of the confluence and deposition of this material downstream
in section B–B0 (Figure 14b).
In addition, the growth of the city along the Ichilo riverbanks has
brought modification to the natural state of the river. In order to pro-
tect the city against bank erosion, some protection works have been
implemented on the banks. These works may have constrained the
position and direction of the channel axis in the right bank of the
Ichilo River. Furthermore, the location of the protection works coin-
cides with the area where riverbed erosion is observed, as illustrated
in Figures 14 and 15. In the absence of this constraint, the meander

CONCLUSIONS
We studied the planform morphodynamics and riverbed topography
of a small meandering river (Ichilo) in the upper part of the Bolivian
Amazon basin. Through spatiotemporal remote sensing analysis and
field works, we aimed to understand the factors that control the plan-
form evolution of the Ichilo River. Our results showed cutoffs as the
main mechanism of planform change of the Ichilo River, together with
human interventions. The maximum annual water level showed a
small to moderate correlation with the meander migration rates. Also,
heavy rainfalls observed in the Ichilo River seem to correlate with the
occurrence of cutoffs, increases in the river width and meander migra-
tion rates. A spatiotemporal analysis of the width variation has shown
that a PDF distribution can describe the river width variation in the
Ichilo River. A GEV probability distribution provided the best fit of
data for the period from 1988 to 2013, while for the period from
2014 to 2018 an inverse Gaussian distribution showed a better fit.
The PDFs presented a similar shape in years with no cutoff, but years
with cutoff showed changes in the PDFs. This study highlights the
potential of SfM analysis combined with MBES bathymetric surveys
to obtain data in areas of remote access, showing us the riverbed and
bank changes in great detail. In addition to the aforementioned fac-
tors, we want to mention the possibility that the increased rate of for-
est loss in the last 30 years in the south and southwest area of the
Ichilo and Sajta rivers has affected the meander migration rates in the
last years of the studied period (post-2005). The spatial variability of
meander migration rates was discussed by identifying two points sus-
ceptible to cutoffs near the city of Puerto Villarroel. We expect that
cutoff #F1 may have developed first. Future cutoff development will
present further modifications to the ever-changing landscape of the
Ichilo River floodplains. A new cutoff would imply morphological
adjustments such as changes in the riverbed topography due to the
sudden reduction of the river length. A redistribution of sediments
after the event is expected, with an increase in migration rates
downstream.
The collapse of the platform of the port located in Puerto
Villarroel showed the need for bathymetric data and monitoring of
the river. The lack of data on small rivers located in the upper Amazon
basin, such as the Ichilo, calls for more field studies in order to guaran-
tee the safety of the riverine communities that rely on them.
