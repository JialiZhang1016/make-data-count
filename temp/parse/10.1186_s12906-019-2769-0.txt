Abstract
Background: Shenxian-Shengmai (SXSM) Oral Liquid is a CFDA-approved patent Chinese Herbal medicine, which
has been clinically used for the treatment of bradycardia. However, its active components and action mechanism
remain to be established. The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of SXSM on bradycardia and to identify
the possible active components and their pharmacological targets for this action.
Methods: A literature-based meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of SXSM on bradycardia,
which was confirmed by a rat ex vivo cardiac model. Network pharmacology analysis was then conducted to reveal
the potential targets of SXSM active components and their anti-arrhythmia mechanisms. Finally, the identified drug-
target interaction was confirmed by immunofluorescence assay in cardiomyocyte.
Results: Meta-analysis of the available clinical study data shows that Shenxian-Shengmai Oral Liquid has a favorable
effect for bradycardia. In an ex vivo bradycardia model of rat heart, SXSM restored heart rate by affecting Heart rate
variability (HRV) which is associated with autonomic nervous system activity. A drug-target-pathway network
analysis connecting SXSM components with arrhythmia suggested that a prominent anti-arrhythmia mechanisms of
SXSM was via β1-adrenergic signaling pathway, which was subsequently validated by immunofluorescence assay
showing that SXSM indeed increased the expression of ADRB1 in cultured cardiomyocytes.
Conclusion: By combining approaches of clinical evidence mining, experimental model confirmation, network
pharmacology analyses and molecular mechanistic validation, we show that SXSM is an effective treatment for
bradycardia and it involves multiple component interacting via multiple pathways, among which is the critical β1-
adrenergic receptor upregulation. Our integrative approach could be applied to other multi-component traditional
Chinese medicine investigation where ample clinical data are accumulated but advanced mechanistic studies are
lacking.

Background
Bradycardia, a multi-factorial concomitant health prob-
lem of cardiac vascular diseases (CVDs), is defined as
heart beat lower than 60 bpm. It was divided into sick
sinus syndrome (SSS), escape rhythm, atrioventricular
block (AV block) and intraventricular block [1]. This ir-
regularity of heart rhythm may be either pathological or
physiological. Extensive exercise causes a lower heart
rate of 30–60 bpm in overall 50–80% athletes [2]. Al-
though congenital structural abnormalities always lead
to conduction dysfunction, bradycardia may also occur
in the normal heart as people growing up [3]. Accumu-
lating evidence has indicated that arrhythmia is one of
the common complications in many brain or heart-
disease patients now. Accompany with coronary artery
disease, cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac infarction, and
stroke [1, 4, 5]. Currently, bradycardia treatment consists
of implanting Cardiac implantable electronic device
(CIED) and taking chemical drugs. Although pacemaker
is clinically the most popular treatment, expensive op-
erative cure is not suitable for all patients especially the
old and the weak. In addition, device infection has be-
come a major problem which results in another huge
burden on the patients who paid an expensive implant-
ation surgery costs already [6].
Recently, medicinal herbs have received considerable
attention as treatment alternatives for arrhythmia [7].
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) have been used for
centuries. Compared with western drugs, herbal medi-
cine is more accessible, less expensive, and mostly with
fewer side effects. Clinical reports suggested that Shen-
xian-Shengmai (SXSM) oral liquid, a CFDA-approved
patent Chinese medicine, was effective in treating
bradycardia [8, 9]. SXSM formula consists of eight
herbal components including Radix Ginseng Rubra
(hongshen), Herba Epimedii Brevicornus (yinyanghuo),
Fructus Psoraleae (buguzhi), Fructus Lycii (gouqizi),
Herba Ephedrae Sinicae (mahuang), Asarum heterotro-
poides (xixin), Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae (danshen),
and Hirudo (shuizhi). Prior studies revealed that thera-
peutic effect of SXSM on chronic arrhythmia was re-
lated to the elevation of Na+-Mg2+/Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase
activity and increased expression of Cx43 and Kir2.1
protein [10], increased expression of acetylcholinester-
ase, reduced level of nicotinic receptor and improved
ATP supply [11]. In addition, SXSM was recently reported
to protect heart function in Ischemia/Reperfusion injury
[12]. To understand the chemical basis of SXSM’s anti-
arrhythmia activity, we previously identified a total of 64
compounds in SXSM by UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS and quan-
tified 10 of the major constituents by UPLC-DAD [13].
However, due to the lack of disease-targeted active com-
ponent identification, the pharmacological mechanisms of
SXSM remain to be elucidated.
In this study, clinical evidence of SXSM was evaluated
with a meta-analysis of all published reports up to date.
Then, a chemical database of SXSM was constructed
using data from a variety of TCM database resources
and
our
validated
experimental
results.
Network
pharmacology analysis was preformed to identify poten-
tial drug-disease target
relationship between SXSM
components and bradycardia. The efficacy of SXSM in
alleviating drug-induced arrhythmias was then con-
firmed in ex vivo cardiac model. The major network
pharmacology-predicted mechanism of SXSM action
was finally confirmed by immunofluorescent assay in
cardiomyocytes.

Meta-analysis of clinical studies
Database and search strategies
Following search terms were used as retrieval keywords:
“Shenxian-Shengmai”
OR
“SXSM”
OR
“SSOL”
OR
“Shenxian-Shengmai oral liquid” OR “Shenxian-Sheng-
mai oral solution” in combination with “bradycardia” OR
“bradycardia” and “randomized controlled trial”. Follow-
ing electronic databases (dated from January 2010 to
expiration date as September 2018) were searched:
China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP
Database, Wanfang Database, PubMed, Web of Science,
SinoMed, and IPA Database. The search was limited to
English and Chinese papers and, whenever possible,
MESH terms were used. The reference lists of the
included original papers were also examined. In addition,
clinical trials were searched on the World Health
Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Plat-
form.
For
further
analyzing
clinical
information,
a
reference bibliography of the included studies was sum-
marized and can be searched in supplementary materials
[14–16].
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Based on the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook stan-
dards, the following criteria were formulated for the
selected literatures [17]. The criteria conclude: dupli-
cate publications, descriptive studies, animal research,
reports without statistical indicators and reviews. Pa-
tients with bradycardia were eligible to be included.
All the participants had to meet at least one of the
current or past diagnostic criteria of bradycardia, such
as Guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of common
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases in China
of functional classification and electrocardiogram as-
sessment. A meta-analysis was performed if the inter-
vention, control, and outcomes were the same or
similar. All the patients that studied prescriptions
based on SXSM alone compared with other formula
medicine or western medicine, namely amiodarone
[18], were included. There were no restrictions on
population characteristics or publication type. The
primary outcome measure was the 24 h dynamic elec-
trocardiogram after 4 weeks of treatment with SXSM
in oral, and adverse drug reactions (ADR). The publi-
cation with more complete information was included
in consideration of one identical clinical trial occurred
in duplicated publications. In addition, for insurance
we also searched the reference lists of all full text
papers for additional relevant data.
Data extraction and risk of bias assessment
Data were extracted from the eligible papers screened
on basis of assessing criteria by two reviewers, separ-
ately [19]. Extracted parameters included: a) the title
of the study, b) first author’s name, c) year of publi-
cation, d) article source, e) sample size, f) groups, g)
diagnosis standards, h) details of methodological in-
formation, i) dose form and treatment duration, j) the
details of the control interventions, k) outcomes, l)
adverse effects for each study. Disagreements were re-
solved by discussion. As for the methodological qual-
ity of the included trials was assessed according to
the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of In-
terventions, Version 5.1.0 [17]. The quality of all the
included trials was categorized as three classes: low,
unclear, or high risk of bias following seven criteria:
random sequence generation (selection bias), alloca-
tion concealment (selection bias), blinding of partici-
pants and personnel (performance bias), blinding of
outcome assessments (detection bias), incomplete out-
come data (attrition bias), selective outcome reporting
(reporting bias), and other sources of bias (More de-
tails in supplement materials).
Statistical analysis
RevMan 5.1.0 software, provided by the Cochrane Col-
laboration, was used for data analysis. Dichotomous data
were presented as the odds ratio (OR), and continuous
outcomes were presented as the weighted mean differ-
ence (WMD) or standardized mean difference (SMD),
and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated
for both types of data. The statistical heterogeneity was
presented as significant when the I squared (I2) value
exceeded 50% or P < 0.1. In the absence of significant
heterogeneity, the data using the fixed effects model
(I2 < 50%) were pooled. If there was significant hetero-
geneity, the random effects model (I2 > 50%) [17] were
used. Publication bias were evaluated using funnel plot
analyses whether small sample effect was found. Hetero-
geneity was examined using the I-squared (I2) index. I2
values greater than 50% were considered indicative of
high heterogeneity [20].
Network pharmacology analysis
Database construction
The main source of disease targets was obtained from
IPA
database
(http://www.ingenuity.com).
Additional
databases such as GeneCards, MalaCards, OMIM, and
NCBI gene were manually searched [21, 22], portion of
targets subtracted were added to complement the omis-
sions. Duplicate genes were removed automatically.

Network establishment and analysis
Three datasets, ①SXSM ingredients, ②arrhythmia-asso-
ciated targets, ③SXSM’s major ingredients and their
corresponding targets, were constructed. ClueGo mod-
ule in Cytoscape software and “Build-Path Explorer”
module in IPA were used to build connection and
predict the interaction among compounds, targets and
disease. Each compound or target were defined as a sin-
gle node, and edge represents interaction. In this study,
the algorithm of the network analysis was based on Fish-
er’s exact test with the enrichment score of P-values.
“Overlay-Canonical Pathway” module was used to find
the resulting canonical pathways. “Network analysis”
module was utilized to analyze the correlation degree of
the network which we established before. “Path de-
signer” module was performed to beautify the network
[26, 27].
Isolated heart reperfusion and electrical signal recordings
Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were anesthetized by intra-
peritoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/
kg). While aorta was clamped with a hemostat, hearts
were quickly removed to pre-cooled K-H solution
containing:
120 mM
NaCl,
4.7 mM
KCl,
25.0 mM
NaHCO3, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 11.1 mM
glucose, 2.0 mM Na-pyruvate and 1.8 mM CaCl2. The
isolated heart was hung on Langendorff perfusion
system and perfused with K-H solution equilibrated
with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 mixed gas firstly and three
electrodes were fixed on left ventricle, right atrium
and the earth. When quickly reached a constant pres-
sure at 70–80 mmHg, heart rate and electrocardio-
gram were measured. The bradycardia model was
created by perfusing the heart with 100 nmol/L acetyl-
choline for 1 min, which caused a significant decrease
in heart rhythm [28]. SXSM was administered at a
high dose of 1 mg/ml. The raw ECG data were ex-
tracted from the telemetric recording using a custom
software (BI9800 Biomedical Instruments, China) for
Heart Rate Variability (HRV) measurements. The data
were edited to manually remove instrumental and
physiological artifacts. The following power spectral
variables were determined: high-frequency (HF) com-
ponent (0.15–0.4 Hz, a marker of the parasympathetic
tone), low-frequency (LF) component (0.04–0.15 Hz,
possibly correlated with sympathetic tone or to auto-
nomic balance), and the ratio between LF and HF
powers (LF/HF, index of the interaction between sym-
pathetic and vagal activity).
Immunofluorescence assay (IF)
Validation of the influence of SXSM on β1-adrenergic
signaling pathway was performed by immunofluores-
cence assay with Human H9C2 cardiomyocytes as we
previously described [29]. Cells were divided into 4
groups: control (blank), isoproterenol (positive drug) and
SXSM high and low dose groups. H9C2 cardiomyocytes
were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1.0 × 104
cells/well and maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 24 h.
DMEM with 10% FBS was replaced to serum-free
medium when cells were grown to approximately 80%
confluences. After drug treatment, cells were incubated
at 4 °C overnight with anti-beta 1 Adrenergic Receptor
antibody (1:100 dilution) for 24 h and then rinsed with
PBS for 3 times. Donkey anti-Rabbit IgG H&L (Alexa
Fluor® 555, 1:500 dilution) was then added and incu-
bated for 2 hours and washed for 3 times with PBS.
Next, Hoechst dye was added to stain cell nuclei. After
30 min, cells were rinsed with PBS three times and fluor-
escence density were determined in dark using a high-
content
analysis
(HCA)
instrument
(PE
Operetta),
reflecting the change in receptor expression before and
after drug intervention. Each well was examined under a
fluorescence microscope with × 200 objective. Yellow
and blue colors in stained areas in fields were recognized
by detection system and calculated. The density was the
positive area divided by the total area examined.
Statistical analysis
Data from all the experiments were presented as
mean ± SD. One-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s
t-test were performed using GraphPad Prism 7 soft-
ware (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).
p < 0.05 is considered significant and p < 0.01 is con-
sidered highly significant.
Results
Meta-analysis of SXSM efficacy for bradycardia
A literature search using SXSM-related key words
extracted a total of 917 records from various online
databases. After a secondary screen by the above-
mentioned criteria, 14 articles remain (Fig. 1 and
Additional file 1: Table S1 and Table S2 for details). A
total of 967 patients were included in the analysis. All

same
administration
methods (oral), for the same time course (4 weeks), and
with same detection indexes of 24 h Holter dynamic
electrocardiogram. In addition, plasma viscosity, pace-
maker parameters, or complications were reported in
some of the articles. Among the fourteen selected arti-
cles, 14 cases of side effects such as mildly dry mouth,
nausea, and fatigue, were documented with none of the
adverse events reported extremely serious. The risk fac-
tor assessment of the article was based on Cochrane’s

seven assessment criteria, and the quality of the litera-
ture was examined on a random, double-blind basis.
The results of each assessment are shown in Fig. 2
(More information available in supplemental materials).
Overall, the Meta-analysis showed that the effective
rate of the control group was 67.34%, while that of the
SXSM treatment group was 88.14% by comparison, and
total 95% CI = 3.76, I2 = 0, Z = 7.47 (P < 0.00001, Fig. 2).
Thus, it indicated that SXSM has a better clinical cura-
tive outcome in bradycardia patients. A heterogeneity
analysis by funnel plot showed that all the literatures
included were concentrated in the middle of the funnel
and proved that there was no small sample effect in this
study (Fig. 3b).
SXSM alleviated drug-induced bradycardia in an ex vivo
cardiac model
To confirm the clinical findings, in vitro perfusion model
of isolated rat hearts was used in which arrhythmias
caused by neurotransmitter acetylcholine (Ach) were ana-
lyzed by heart rate (HR) recordings and electrocardio-
gram, and the effect of SXSM was assessed by drug
administration at different time points. As shown in Fig. 3,
compared with the control, Ach caused an apparent slow-
down of the HR from 173 ± 52 to 67 ± 35. SXSM signifi-
cantly accelerated the HR to the normal value (168 ± 61).
On the other hand, LF\HF ratio was dramatically in-
creased in Ach-treated heart compared with the controls
(62 ± 15 vs 196 ± 37).
Anti-bradycardia target prediction of SXSM components
by network pharmacology analysis
Our previous work [13] identified 67 components in
SXSM by UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS and UPLC-DAD. After
mining literatures in PubMed and making supplement
from online TCM databases, relevant targets were
filtrated out to ensure each compound experimentally
verified and database predicted with high-confidence.
Please see Additional file 5 for protein interactions.
Based on this targets database, we analyzed potential
pathways affected by SXSM active components. PPI ana-
lysis and GO analysis in Cytoscape software were first
used to show most probable drug-target interactions and
related disease mechanisms. As shown in Fig. 4, gene

targets (in red) and enriched pathways and functions
(large colored dots) for arrhythmia were ranked accord-
ing to the topological coefficients of network analysis
and predicted P Value (−log). The top ten SXSM-
targeted pathways associated with arrhythmia are in the
order of: Oxytocin signaling, Platelet activation, GnRH
signaling, Rap1 signaling, Adrenergic signaling in cardio-
myocytes, Calcium signaling, AMPK signaling, cAMP
signaling, Estrogen signaling, and Thyroid hormone sig-
naling. As shown in Fig. 4 and Additional file 3: Table
S3, possible interactions between SXSM components
and bradycardia via specific pathways may include 14
SXSM components such as Epimedin B, Bavachalcone,
and Ginsenoside Rb2 via Oxytocin signaling pathway; 17
components such as Ginsenoside Rb2, Salvianolic acid
B, and Danshensu via platelet activation; 15 components
such as Rosmarinic acid via GnRH signaling pathway; 12
components such as Ginsenoside Ro via Rap1 signaling
pathway. Importantly, it was discovered that at least 19
SXSM
components,
such
as
Phenylpropanolamine,
Pseudoephedrine, and Ephedrine, could play a role in
regulating adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes. This
prediction was further verified in Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis
(IPA)
database
by
specifically
analyzing
bradycardia-related targets. G-protein coupled receptors,
ion channels, and enzymes are among the major disease
target types revealed. In all, 17 arrhythmia-related tar-
gets were identified, consistent with the expectation that
a multi-target interaction mechanism may be involved in
a multi-component medicine such as SXSM. In particu-
lar, the family of adrenergic receptors occupied a signifi-
cant proportion of disease-related targets (Fig. 5) and
was chosen for the validation test next.
SXSM increased ADRB1 expression in cultured
cardiomyocytes
The effect of SXSM on adrenergic receptors was ex-
amined by immunofluorescence detection of ADRB1
expression in cultured H9c2 myocytes. As shown in
Fig. 6, in the untreated control cells, the expression
of ADRB1 was minimal whereas isoproterenol treat-
ment increased ADRB1 level (p < 0.01). In compari-
son, high doses of SXSM prominently elevated the
ADRB1 protein expression (p < 0.001) while low doses
of SXSM had no effect (Fig. 7).
Discussion
In this study, we first evaluated the clinical efficacy of
SXSM for bradycardia with a meta-analysis of publicly
available literature and confirmed it in an isolated rat
heart
model.
Using
network
pharmacology

followed by experimental validation, we proved that

mechanistically the anti-bradycardia effect of SXSM
could be at least in part by upregulation of ADRB1
expression in cardiomyocytes. Innovations of this paper
include: 1) an integrative study from clinical data meta-
analysis to network pharmacology mechanism prediction
and validation on a compound TCM formula; 2) discov-
ery and confirmation that one of the possible anti-
bradycardia mechanisms of SXSM is by regulating car-
diac β1-adrenergic pathway.
In this study, we started from the clinical case analysis
and found that SXSM indeed showed advantages in the
treatment of bradycardia. It is worth noticing that while
this research paper was in submission, a review article
was published that also evaluated the effectiveness of

bradycardia
[30]. The meta-
analysis (including 1197 in SXSM group and 1133 in
control group) was performed with a fixed- effect model
as no significant heterogeneity was found (I2 < 50%, P >
0.1). It showed that SXSM was effective in treating
bradycardia (RR: 1.33, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.39, P < 0.00001).
Although the conclusions reached in this study and ours
presented in this paper are consistent, our study design
has eliminated the arrhythmia caused by other diseases
during the screening process and chosen a fixed time
course of 4 weeks. It is widely accepted that clinical and
methodological source contribute to the heterogeneity of
statistics. For our analysis, firstly, the dosage and time of
SXSM oral liquid used by the patients were consistent.
There were differences in the severity of bradycardia
of patients in the fourteen included trials. Secondly,
for most of these studies, the sample sizes were small
and none of the trails were double blinded. Thirdly,
doctor’s diagnose level and ECG equipment used in
different hospitals could contribute additional variabil-
ity. Therefore, high quality randomized clinical trials
are needed to further clarify the SXSM efficacy as a
complementary therapy for arrhythmia.
We used an isolated rat heart model of drug-induced
bradycardia to experimentally confirm the SXSM effect. As
expected, administration of acetylcholine increased LF\HF
value, slowed heart rate, demonstrated an enhanced vagus

nerve and sympathetic nerve activity in the model group.
After treatment of SXSM, both the LF\HF ratio and heart
rate reversed to normal level. We speculated that this
phenomenon was because of the chemical composition in
SXSM regulate the release of autologous acetylcholine by
affecting the nerve activity, thereby maintaining its level in
the steady state and finally increasing the heart rate (Fig. 3).
The complexity of the chemical composition in TCM
formulas brings great challenges to pharmacological re-
search. Network pharmacology of data mining and pre-
diction has played a guiding role in the research of
potential mechanism in recent years. It has become one
of the most widely used techniques to explore com-
pound TCM formulas. Our analysis showed that neuro-
modulation of SXSM is mainly via affecting the ADR
receptor family (Fig. 4). Twenty-nine of these targets
were common for both disease and drug chemical data-
base, which were listed in Additional file 4: Table S4.
Compounds originated from Herba Ephedrae Sinicae
(mahuang) and Herba Epimedii Brevicornus (yinyan-
ghuo) contribute mostly to the influence of ADR recep-
tor family, particularly ADRB1 protein, which is known
to affect heart rhythm by neuronal regulation. The rest
compounds from other six herbs tend to play a role in
humoral regulation that is associated with cytokines in
the process of inflammation and injury, such as TNF,
TGFβ1, IL6, and SIRT6. This indicated that SXSM could
be considered to treat those patients who suffered from
cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, myocardium inflam-
mation and thrombus in order to prevent complication
of bradycardia.
Holistic approach is the core principle of Traditional
Chinese medicine, which is also supported by our find-
ings in this study. For example, the effect of SXSM on
elevating heart rate in bradycardia not only include
heart-specific actions such as β1-Adrenergic receptor
activation1, but also multiple neuronal regulation in
brain and systemic inflammatory response. However, a
holistic action of a compound formula is composed of
multiple compound-specific actions – only when we
understand these individual compound-specific action
and integrate them into a coordinated network, that
we will be fully interpret a holistic action. Our pathway
prediction suggested a potential mechanism of multi-
target regulation of arrhythmia by a TCM formula.
The top10 predicted signaling pathways revealed sig-
nificant functional implications. For example, oxytocin
(OT) is a common neurotransmitter released by para-
ventricular nucleus (PVN). It is related to regulation of
pain perception. The heart protective effects of OT are

mediated through opening the mitoKATP channels
[31]. Thrombosis is common in cardiovascular and
cerebrovascular
diseases
and
arrhythmia
is
tightly
associated with myocardial ischemia and myocardial
infarction. Changes of platelet reactivity to thrombin
observed after restoration of sinus rhythm in patients
proved that arrhythmia intrinsically leads to increased
reactivity
of
platelets
[32].
Gonadotropin-releasing
hormone (GnRH) is a neurotransmitter that reported
to have connection with inflammation signaling in
cardiomyocytes [33]. Epac2-Rap1 signaling regulates
reactive oxygen species production and susceptibility
to arrhythmia [34]. Analysis of Rap1 signaling pathway
indicates that SXSM may affect cellular interaction and
attenuate mitochondrial ROS production and reduce
arrhythmia susceptibility. β-adrenergic regulation of
late Na+ current during cardiac action potential and its
regulation of arrhythmia was recently reported [35].
Actually, calcium signaling and cAMP signaling path-
ways are partially overlapping and closely related to
adrenergic signaling pathway. Abnormal calcium hand-
ling results in a predisposition to atrial fibrillation [36].
Our
prediction
of
AMP-activated
protein
kinase
(AMPK) signaling pathway suggests that SXSM may
also play a role in affecting energy metabolism in car-
diomyocytes. AMPK activation has attracted more and
more attention in the development of new therapeutic
strategies for cardiometabolic disease [37]. In sum-
mary, we believe that from the SXSM components
identified so far, its anti-bradycardia effect are mainly
focused on regulating the release of neurotransmitters,
causing nervous system excitement. Supplemented by
promoting blood flow and increasing energy metabol-
ism, finally increased the heart rate.
The new guideline on the evaluation and manage-
ment of patients with bradycardia [38] demonstrated
that for patients with acute bradycardia of AV block,
who are at low likelihood of coronary ischemia but
associated with symptoms or hemodynamic comprom-
ise, β-agonist drugs (such as isoproterenol, dopamine,
dobutamine, or epinephrine) are recommended treat-
ment to increase heart rate and improve symptoms.
Cardiac β-adrenergic pathway is one of the classic
pathways for regulating arrhythmias. β1-Adrenergic
receptor (β1-ARs) activation can provoke arrhythmia
mediated by activate cAMP-dependent Ca2+ release
from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via phosphoryl-
ation
of
RyR2.
In
the
updated
classification
of
antiarrhythmic drugs published in 2018, β-receptor
modulators are classed as type II antiantiarrhythmic
drugs [39]. What’s more, cAMP can activate both
protein kinase A (PKA) and the exchange protein
directly triggered by cAMP (Epac) which mediates
β1-AR-induced
arrhythmia
via
CaMKII
or
RyR2
phosphorylation, and activates LTCC [26]. Some prior
studies indicated that SXSM could regulate RYR2\PLB
protein [10], which may cause LTCC activation via L-
calcium channel. β-adrenergic pathway has been a
frequent focus for research of cardiac diseases like
heart failure and hypertrophy [40, 41]. Our network
pharmacology prediction and experimental validation
confirm
that
SXSM
may
play
a
therapeutic
role
through this classic pathway, providing guidance for
its rational clinical application.
It is worth noticing that over the recent years, adren-
aline has been gradually recognized to also inhibit
inward potassium current Iks, activate acetylcholine
coupled inward potassium current Iache, regulate mul-
tiple ion channels, and coordinate antiarrhythmic drugs.
Ion channels on cellular membranes play a direct and
crucial role in the formation of normal heart rhythm,
whose open and close process leads to the generation of
action potential (AP). Once the dynamic equilibrium on
ion channels is broken, arrhythmia may occur. Accord-
ingly, most of the current anti-arrhythmic drugs are ion
channel modulators. Electrophysiological research on
compounds present in the eight Chinese herbs in SXSM
has not been carried out extensively so far, which limited
the power of our network pharmacology analysis. How-
ever, it also justifies that further investigation of SXSM
should include electrophysiological exploration of its
components on ion channel target.
In summary, although traditional Chinese herbal
medicine has a long history of the treatment for car-
diac rhythm symptoms dating back to as early as in
the Han dynasty of China, it has not received enough
attention due to the lack of in-depth clinical to basic
science investigations. Our future work will identify
active chemical components and reveal their specific
mechanisms of SXSM, hoping to provide alternative
therapeutic options to arrhythmia patients who could
not accept pacemaker implantation.
Conclusions
In this study, we established the efficacy of Shenxian-
Shengmai Oral Liquid for bradycardia by both meta-
analysis of clinical data and ex vivo study in rat heart.
We identified a number of critical pathways including
the critical β1-adrenergic signaling pathway and mecha-
nisms that could be affected by SXSM. Our approaches
integrated clinical, experimental and network pharma-
cology
analyses
to
reveal
the
compounds-targets-
pathways-disease connections and uncover the under-
lying mechanisms of a compound herbal medicine,
which could be applied to other multi-component trad-
itional Chinese medicine investigation where ample clin-
ical data are accumulated but advanced mechanistic
studies are lacking.
