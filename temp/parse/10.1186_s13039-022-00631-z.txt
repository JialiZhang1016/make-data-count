Abstract 
Background  The human genome presents variation at distinct levels, copy number variants (CNVs) are DNA seg‑
ments of variable lengths that range from several base pairs to megabases and are present at a variable number 
of copies in human genomes. Common CNVs have no apparent influence on the phenotype; however, some rare 
CNVs have been associated with phenotypic traits, depending on their size and gene content. CNVs are detected by 
microarrays of different densities and are generally visualized, and their frequencies analysed using the HapMap as 
default reference population. Nevertheless, this default reference is inadequate when the samples analysed are from 
people from Mexico, since population with a Hispanic genetic background are minimally represented. In this work, 
we describe the variation in the frequencies of four common CNVs in Mexican-Mestizo individuals.
Results  In a cohort of 147 unrelated Mexican-Mestizo individuals, we found that the common CNVs 2p11.2 (99.6%), 
8p11.22 (54.5%), 14q32.33 (100%), and 15q11.2 (71.1%) appeared with unexpectedly high frequencies when con‑
trasted with the HapMap reference (ChAS). Yet, while when comparing to an ethnically related reference population, 
these differences were significantly reduced or even disappeared.
Conclusion  The findings in this work contribute to (1) a better description of the CNVs characteristics of the Mexican 
Mestizo population and enhance the knowledge of genome variation in different ethnic groups. (2) emphasize the 
importance of contrasting CNVs identified in studied individuals against a reference group that—as best as possi‑
ble—share the same ethnicity while keeping this relevant information in mind when conducting CNV studies at the 
population or clinical level.

Background
The human genome presents distinct variations: sin-
gle nucleotide variants, insertion‒deletion of a few 
nucleotides, repetitive sequences of a variable num-
ber of nucleotides, and structural variants. The human 
genome is 3.1 giga base pairs (Gb) in size, distributed 
in 23 pairs of chromosomes so that every individual 
inherits one copy from each parent and has two cop-
ies or copy number (CN) CN = 2 of every locus in their 
cells (except for the X and Y loci in males). In 2004, two 
independent groups, Iafrate and Sebat [1, 2], described 
for the first time the genome-wide presence of large-
scale copy number variations in the human genome; 
these variants involve gains or losses of several to hun-
dreds of kilobases (kb) of genomic DNA among pheno-
typically normal individuals, and these copy number 
variants (CNVs) are an important source of human 
genomic variation [3]. Common CNVs have a minor 
allele frequency (MAF) > 5% and no apparent influence 
on the phenotype. However, some rare CNVs, with 
MAF < 1%, have been associated with phenotypic traits 
[4], and a few of them have shown clinical relevance 
depending on their size, gene content, or when overlap 
with genes that manifest haploinsufficiency (when CNV 
is CN = 1) or triplosensitivity (when CNV is CN > 2) [5, 
6]. In some occasions, their interaction with additional 
genetic or environmental factors may influence whether 
CNVs have a detectable phenotypic effect [7, 8]. CNV 
represents a significant proportion of the total genetic 
variability in all human populations [9–11]. A CNV was 
initially defined as a DNA segment larger than one kb 
with a variable copy number compared to a reference 
genome [12]. Nevertheless, this term has extended to 
all quantitative variations in the genome, including tan-
dem repeats, deletions, and duplications [13].
The accurate detection and interpretation of CNVs 
are essential for research and clinical diagnostics 
because CNVs may be a general population variant 
or associated with pathology [14]. Therefore, it has 
become increasingly important to detect the presence 
of common and harmless CNVs within different eth-
nic groups to avoid misinterpretation of pathological 
variants.
The Database of Genomic Variants (DGV) was initi-
ated to provide a publicly accessible, comprehensive, 
and curated catalog of genomic variants [15]. The DGV 
comprises the CNVs and structural variations found 
in the genomes of control individuals from worldwide 
populations. However, only three studies in this database 
included individuals with Mexican ancestry, and they are 
the same in all three studies [16–18]. Furthermore, cur-
rently it only comprises individuals born in the US with 
parents and grandparents of Mexican origin, represent-
ing only 3% of the total Mexican population [19].
In general, this could represent an issue since the con-
tribution of the ethnic group is diluted when the entire 
group is used as a reference.
Therefore, it is necessary to report information on this 
type, especially for underrepresented populations.
Several methodologies are commonly used for CNV 
genome-wide study; one of the most robust methods 
is microarray analysis, mainly when an array contains a 
high density of probes. Most CNV studies are performed 
with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays, 
which, in addition to providing information on CNV in 
the genome, also provide information at the allele level, 
highlighting the presence of regions/runs of homozy-
gosity called long contiguous stretches of homozygosity 
(LCSH) and providing essential clues regarding parental 
relatedness (consanguinity), uniparental disomy, chro-
mosomal recombination or rearrangements [20, 21].
This work describes the frequency of four common 
CNVs found using SNP microarrays in unrelated Mexi-
can-Mestizo individuals, who were healthy or had ane-
uploidies, and in whom structural alterations in their 
genome was not suspected. The study highlights the 
frequency variation of these common CNVs depending 
on the ethnic origin of the population used as reference 
for comparison.
It is essential to recognize the ethnic differences in 
the distribution and frequency of CNVs, not only to 
recognize their contribution to structural chromosomal 
variation but also to ease recognition of possible asso-
ciations between CNVs and phenotypic characteristics 
that may or may not be pathogenic.
Results
We studied the presence of CNV in a population of 147 
Mexican-Mestizo individuals, 50 phenotypically nor-
mal (MXM, 30 females and 20 males) and 97 patients 
with aneuploidies (MXM_A, 41 with trisomy 21, 28 
with monosomy X, 11 with trisomy 13 and 17 with tri-
somy 18), which are part of a more extensive study that 
aims to find genomic differences among these groups. 
In this first study, we show four CNVs in common 
among all these groups, with a very high frequency in 
our population when contrasted with distant popu-
lations, as is the mix of the HapMap reference that 
includes African, Asian, and Caucasian individuals.
Long contiguous stretches of homozygosity
To recognize the presence of inbreeding and consan-
guinity in our sample population, we analyzed the

regions with homozygosity or long contiguous stretches 
of homozygosity (LCSH) with Affymetrix Genome-
Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 (GW SNP 6.0). Eighteen of 
the 50 healthy controls (MXM) studied showed at least 
one autosomal region with LCSH. In the aneuploidy 
group (MXM_A), 73/97 presented at least one autoso-
mal region with LCSH.
In addition, we analyzed 99 CEL files from 99 blood 
samples of Mexican women with breast cancer (MXM_
WBC) present in public databases, where 75/99 pre-
sented at least one autosomal region with LCSH.
Neither of these LCSH regions overlaps with the CNV 
reported in this study, and more than 42% are com-
mon LCSHs, such as the 2q11.1q11.2, 11p11.2p12.1, 
16p11.2p11.1, and 20q11.21q11.23 regions previously 
reported [22–24]. The inbreeding coefficient (F) cal-
culated in the three groups supports the absence of 
inbreeding or consanguinity (Table 1).
Ancestry
We deduced the ancestry in our MXM and MXM_A 
groups compared with the Mexican ancestry in Los 
Angeles CA, USA (MXL) included in the HapMap pro-
ject (64 Mexican individuals born in the US). First, we 
noticed that our population (MXM and MXM_A) has 
almost the same genetic content of European descent 
from Utah, USA (CEU), Native American (NAT), and 
Yoruba from Nigeria (YRI), then those studied for the 
HapMap, with NAT being the most significant contri-
bution, even greater than for MXL, 0.488 vs 0.678 and 
0.618, then of Caucasians and finally Africans (Fig. 1).

Copy number variants with high frequency 
in Mexican‑Mestizo population
We found CNV in almost all individuals and in all the 
chromosomes; however, we observed four polymor-
phisms that occurred in chromosomes 2 (2.9 megabases 
(Mb)), 8 (0.15 Mb), 14 (1.02 Mb), and 15 (0.76 Mb) with 
a high frequency in the general population of Mexican-
Mestizo (MXM), in Mexican-Mestizo with aneuploidy 
(MXM_A), and in the MXM_WBC group (Figs. 2 and 3) 
(Table 2).
In region 2p11.2 for MXM healthy tissues, there was 
a gain of 3 and 4 copies, CN = 3 in 58% and CN = 4 in 
41%, respectively, and only one case (0.67%) was CN = 2 
(Fig.  2a); for MXM_A, 21% of cases presented with 
CN = 3 and 79% with CN = 4, with an overall copy gain 
across all groups of 99.6% (Fig. 2b, Table 2).
For chromosome 8p11.2, almost half of the cases, 42% 
of MXM and 51% of MXM_A, have CN = 2, but 49% 
MXM and 41% MXM_A have losses with CN = 1, and 
the rest (9% and 8%, respectively) have null CN = 0. The 
frequency of CN ≠ 2 across all the groups is 54.5% (Fig. 2, 
Table 2).
The CNV located in 14q32.33 is present as CN = 3 in 
55% of MXM healthy samples and 62% in MXM_A sam-
ples and as CN = 4 in 45% of MXM and 38% of MXM_A 
subjects; there is not a single individual who shows 
CN = 2, 100% of individuals presented with gain in this 
region (Table 2, Fig. 2a and b).
Finally, in 15q11.2, approximately 70% of the samples 
had either gains or losses: 40% and 38% of the MXM 
healthy tissues and MXM_A samples, respectively, 
showed loss CN = 1, while 31.5% of MXM and 31% of 
MXM_A had gain with CN = 3, giving a frequency of 
CN ≠ 2 across all the groups of 71.1%.
The common CNV in MXM healthy subjects and tis-
sues observed utilizing HapMap as a population of refer-
ence is shown in Fig. 3a.
Validation of CN by qPCR
We performed qPCR to corroborate the CN obtained 
with GW SNP Array 6.0 and analyzed the gDNA for a 
representative sample of the individuals studied, includ-
ing nine MXM individuals and seven MXM_A individu-
als. With this method, 15 out of 16 samples (93.75%) 
in locus 2p11.2 showed CN from 4 to 17 copies (ChAS 
only detects up to CN = 4). For chromosome 8, locus 
8p11.22 A total of 14/16 (87.5%) samples showed < 2 cop-
ies. For 14q32.33, we corroborated the gain of the CNV 
in 13/16 (81.25%) with 3 to 5 copies; for chromosome 15, 
we found both losses and gains by GW, and we found 4

patients with loss and 6 with copy gains (25% and 37.5%, 
respectively) (Table 3, Fig. 3).
CRMA v2 analysis
The CNV found with the Chromosome Analysis Suite 
(ChAS) was validated with an additional CNV calling 
method CRMA v2.
We declare the raw data set conformed by 50 MXM 
CEL files (Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0).
This method could compare the copy number estimates 
in 14q32.33 for each sample. Figure  4 shows the CNV 
calling for chromosome 14 in subject C12 in the A) C12 
vs MXM reference. B) C12 vs Spanish population (IBS) 
reference. C) C12 vs CEU reference. D) CN in the C12 vs. 
YRI reference. E) CN in C12 vs. two populations included 
in the HapMap reference (CEU + YRI). It is important to 
note that the difference in CN in our sample depends on 
the reference used.
It is clear that in A and B, the 14q32.33 region does 
not show changes with respect to the Mexican and 
Spanish reference population, emphasizing our Mes-
tizo race formed by Spanish and Native American 
groups. In contrast, comparisons with CEU, YRI and 
CEU + YRI make evident a gain of probes located in the 
chr14:106,078,230–107,100,266 region, showing our 
racial differences with these populations.
Discussion
In the tested samples, we found four high-frequency 
CNVs in the following loci: 2p11.2, 8p11.22, 14q32.33, 
and 15q11.2. No genes were found at 2p11.2 or 15q11.2, 
while the CNV at 8p11.22 included the genes ADAM5 
(HGNC: 212) and ADAM3A (HGNC: 209). The 
14q32.33 locus comprises the genes KIAA0125 (HGNC: 
9834), ADAM6 (HGNC: 8755), LINC00226 (HGNC:

CEU and YRI samples

338,004), IGHD (HGNC:5480), IGHG3 (HGNC:5527), 
and IGHG1 (HGNC:5525); none of these genes has 
been associated with Mendelian diseases (OMIM) 
related to genetic dosage (https://​search.​clini​calge​
nome.​org/​kb/​gene-​dosage/​region/​ISCA-​37477), 
and 
there are no regulatory sequences that could mod-
ify gene expression in any of the regions of the four 
CNV; neither of our CNV reported overlap with LCSH 
regions.
Additionally, by searching these specific regions in 
databases such as the sSMC (small supernumerary 
marker chromosomes) database http://​cs-​tl.​de/​DB/​CA/​
sSMC/0-​Start.​html and the chromosomal heteromor-
phisms database http://​cs-​tl.​de/​DB/​CA/​HCM/0-​Start.​
html, we found no evidence that a number other than 
CN = 2 in the 2p11.2, 8p11.22 and 15q11.2 regions or 
14q32.33 duplications is associated with pathology, indi-
cating that numerical variants in these regions have no 
impact on the phenotype, probably due to the absence of 
dosage-sensitive genes [25].
The high frequency of some variants could be due to 
the existence of inbreeding or consanguinity in the popu-
lation. However, according to our results on the percent-
age of homozygosity of the LCSH regions and the degree 
of inbreeding (F value) [26], there is no indication of 
inbreeding or consanguinity in the studied groups.
CNVs are genomic variants that confer high vari-
ability among individuals and have been recognized 
for several years [1–3]. The first CNV studies were per-
formed in the HapMap collection, which comprises 270 
subjects divided into four populations: 90 Yoruba from 
Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI), 90 European descent from Utah, 
USA (CEU), 45 Japanese from Tokyo, Japan (JPT) and 
45 Han Chinese from Beijing, China (CHB) [4]. In that 
study, the gDNA was analyzed with 500  K Affymetrix 
SNP arrays, and the CNV was determined using the soft-
ware provided by Affymetrix. No individual presented 
CNVs at 2p11.2, 8p11.22, 14q32.33, or 15q11.2. In 2010, 
a study of large CNVs (1 kb) performed in 450 samples 
of HapMap (180 CEU, 180 YRI, 45 JPT and 45 CHB) 
reported CNV at 14q32.33 with a frequency less than 1% 
and in 2p11.2, 8p11.22 and 15q11.2 with a frequency near 
5% [13].
Later in 2015, the phase 3 1000 genome study included 
2504 healthy individuals, only 64 of them (2.5% of the 
total sample analyzed) were individuals of Mexican 
descent, and they all were living in Los Angeles, Califor-
nia (MXL) [18] This study in which Hispanic genomes 
were underrepresented showed low frequencies for 
CNVs at 2p11.2, 8p11.22, 14q32.33 and 15q11.2, coinci-
dent with the data previously reported by Conrad et al.
[13].
Now we know that the CNV rate of occurrence has 
wide differences according to the ethnic group that is 
studied, as it occurs with other polymorphic traits such 
as SNPs or microsatellites [27]. Furthermore, frequencies 
may vary depending on the microarray platform used 
and the CNV calling algorithms [20, 28].
The results presented here are based on the Affymetrix 
microarray platform and were analyzed using Affym-
etrix software, with Affymetrix annotations NetAffx 33.1, 
which is the default software provided with this commer-
cial platform. This workflow is the one being used to find 
CNV for clinical and research studies in Mexico and in 
several other countries, however, in this software there is 
little representation of the Latin American population.
In fact, there are studies reporting association of some 
of the polymorphisms studied, to pathological conditions 
[29–31]; one of these studies was conducted in Brazil and 
described the association of CNV gain of the 14q32.33 
region with dental tumors [32], the reported copy gain 
in this 14q32.33 locus is as compared to the default ref-
erence genome without taking into account possible 
ethnic differences of the studied population, an ethnic 
matched reference genome would not have shown gain 
in this region. Indeed in 2020, Godoy et al. identified a 
CNV obtained from three different microarray platforms 
from a Brazilian population to conform the Brazilian 
CNV database. They found that a 14q32.33 gain was pre-
sent in 97.8% of the samples studied [33], similar to that 
found in our study in 100% of the samples. Interestingly, 
the origins of the Brazilian population and ours have in 
common the mixture of the Iberian population that con-
quered us centuries ago.
The foregoing was addressed in this work by CNV call-
ing (CRMA), where a Spanish population was used as 
reference, with this better-suited ethnical matched refer-
ence the gain of the CNV at 14q32.33 was reduced, and 
even did not appear as copy number gain (Fig. 4a and b).
The findings presented in this study contribute to the 
description of the frequency of common CNV in the 
Mexican-Mestizo population. Because microarrays are 
widely used tools in diagnostic and research contexts, 
this work is a clear example of why CNVs analysis must 
be carried out using an ethnically appropriate reference 
population. The significance of this is being recognized 
more wildly, as a consequence of this there is a conscient 
effort to include more diverse ethnic groups in the wildly 
used reference databases like HapMap [19]. This inclusive 
policy is fundamental to have a more accurate represen-
tation of the human genome.

Conclusions
We found four CNVs, 2p11.2, 8p11.22, 14q32.33, and 
15q11.2, with a high frequency in the Mexican-Mestizo 
population when contrasted with the HapMap popula-
tion of reference (ChAS), while when using an ethnically 
related population as a reference, the differences were 
reduced or disappeared, highlighting the importance of 
analyzing the CNVs of the studied individuals with a ref-
erence group that (as far as possible) shares the same eth-
nicity. These findings contribute to a better description of 
the CNVs characteristics of the Mexican-Mestizo popu-
lation and enhance the knowledge of genome variation in 
different ethnic groups.
Methods
Population, samples, and DNA extraction
We included blood samples from subjects with Mexican-
Mestizo origin who consented to participating in this 
study. Fifty were healthy, unrelated volounteers from the 
general population. All subjects were over 18  years of 
age, had no history of genetic diseases and at the time of 
sample donation were not suffering from any infectious 
disease nor taking any medications (MXM, 30 females 
and 20 males). All participants had a normal karyotype 
46,XX in females and 46,XY in males (20 corroborated 
by G banding in 25 metaphases, and 30 by chromosome 
microarray). We also included 97 aneuploid patients 
(MXM_A, 41 with trisomy 21, 28 with monosomy X, 11 
with trisomy 13 and 17 with trisomy 18), with karyotype 
showing regular trisomy as well as X-monosomy without 
mosaicism, which was corroborated by interphase FISH 
(1000 cells analyzed).
Genomic DNA was extracted from the blood samples 
obtained from the participants with the saline precipi-
tation method (Gentra Puregene Kit, QIAGEN, Venlo, 
Limburg, NL).
Genome‑wide Human SNP arrays
We analyzed the gDNA with the Affymetrix GeneChip® 
Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 (Santa Clara, 
CA, USA). This array contains 906,600 SNP probes and 
946,000 nonpolymorphic oligonucleotides; the median 
intermarker distance over all 1.8 million SNP and copy 
number markers combined is less than 700 bases.
The procedures for DNA digestion, ligation, PCR 
amplification, fragmentation, labeling, denaturing and 
hybridization into the array were performed in 147 DNA 
samples (two DNA samples were not included because 
they did not pass quality controls) according to the pro-
tocols provided by the supplier. Arrays were stained 
and washed in the Affymetrix GeneChip Fluidic Station 
450 and scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip Scan-
ner 3000 7G (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). We 
analyzed the files obtained with the appropriate bioinfor-
matics tools.
Long contiguous stretches of homozygosity
We visualized the long contiguous stretches of homozy-
gosity (LCSH) in Chromosome Analysis Suite (ChAS) 
software version 4.1, provided by Affymetrix (Affyme-
trix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). For the analysis, we used the 
NetAffx 33 hg19 annotation files (http://​www.​affym​etrix.​
com). For LCSH > 3  Mb, the analysis configuration was 
set at LOH with marker count = 50 and size = 3000  kb, 
and for LCSH > 5 Mb, it was set at marker count = 50 and 
size = 5000 kb.
Estimation of the coefficient of inbreeding (F)
Individual inbreeding coefficients (F) were estimated 
using LCSH > 3 Mb data; F was the total length of auto-
somal LCSH in kb divided by the total autosomal size 
covered by the Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 
(2,881,033,286 kb for hg19). We report the average of the 
F value for each group. An F value of 0.25 could reflect a 
first-degree parental relationship, 0.125 a second-degree 
relationship, 0.0625 a third-degree relationship and 
0.03125 a fourth-degree relationship [26].
Additional files
To compare our studied population, we used the fol-
lowing CEL files obtained from Affymetrix GeneChip® 
Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 (Santa Clara, CA, 
USA):
(a) Ninety-nine files from healthy tissues obtained from 
women with breast cancer (MXM_WBC) [34] from the 
GEO open database (GSE87048).
Together with the MXM, they will be the Healthy 
tissues.
(b) 30 Spanish (IBS) files downloaded from GEO data 
set GSE67047 [35]
(c) 30 Caucasian (CEU) and 10 Yoruba (YRI), part of 
the population studied in the HapMap project, CEL files 
kindly provided by Affymetrix/Thermo Fisher.
Ancestry
The MAP and PED files obtained by Genotyping Console 
software (Affymetrix) were used for the ancestry analysis; 
we eliminated two files that did not pass quality control.
The global ancestry of 49/50 healthy Mexican-Mes-
tizo files (MXM) and 96/97 individuals with aneuploidy 
(MXM_A) was deduced through a supervised maximum 
likelihood ADMIXTURE approach from K = 2 to K = 3 
ancestral components and compared with the global 
ancestry of the group MXL (Mexican ancestry from 
Los Angeles California US) (n = 64). For this analysis, 
Page 10 of 14
Sánchez et al. Molecular Cytogenetics            (2023) 16:2 
genotypic frequencies of Northern European (CEU) 
(n = 99), Yoruba (YRI) (n = 108), and Native American 
(NAT) (n = 43), reported in the  1000 genomes project 
(1KGP), were considered as reference parental popula-
tions for demographic and historical reasons.
Copy number variant (CNV) calling
CNVs were visualized with Affymetrix software (Affy-
metrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). GeneChip Command 
Console (AGCC) software was used to generate the CEL 
files and ARR files from each microarray scanned. The 
CEL and ARR files were analyzed with Genotyping Con-
sole software (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) to 
Fig. 5  Chromosome 14 image with CNV highlighted, CN > 2 in blue arrowheads, and the regions with CN = 1 in red arrowheads, the CN regions 
with copy number (CN = 2) are only marked in lines. CNV in 14q32.33 is present in all samples of our group of study (n = 246). CN: Copy Number

obtain the CN data files (CNCHP) MAP and PED files 
for ancestry. CNCHP data were analyzed using Chromo-
some Analysis Suite (ChAS) software version 4.1 (Affym-
etrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
The annotation file used in our analysis can be found 
on the Affymetrix website, listed as NetAffx 33.1 (hg19). 
The reporting threshold of the copy number was set at 
"High Resolution" settings, which gave us a total of gains 
or losses of 100 kb with a marker count ≥ 50. The copy 
number variants were compared among all samples. The 
CN analysis in ChAS software (http://​www.​affym​etrix.​
com) has two ways of showing the results: one as a table 
that includes both coordinates and CN for each region; 
or a graphical interphase that displays the results of CN 
in an image of each of the 23 chromosomes, highlighting 
the regions with CN > 2 in blue arrowhead, regions with 
CN = 1 in red arrowhead, or CN regions with copy num-
ber (CN = 2), which are only marked in lines (Fig. 5).
To corroborate the changes in the CN obtained by GW 
SNP 6.0, we analyzed the absolute changes in copy num-
ber with qPCR in a representative sample. Oligonucleo-
tides primers were designed at the four loci with CN ≠ 2 
and for a distal locus on the same chromosome, where 
CN = 2 was used as a copy number control (Table  4). 
qPCR was performed with LightCycler ® Master (Roche 
Diagnostics) using hydrolysis TaqMan® probes (Univer-
sal Probes, Roche) with 100 ng of DNA, 45 amplification 
cycles and a single quantification. For those chromo-
somal regions in which it is possible to have a CN = 2 
control DNA, the method proposed by Livak of ­2−DDCt 
was used [36]; for the loci where all subjects showed the 
change in the CN, the ­2−DCt method was used (Table 3) 
[36].
For an additional CNV calling method, we used copy 
number estimation using robust multichip analysis, 
and this method provides full-resolution raw total copy 
number estimates by preprocessing and probe summa-
rization. CRMA v2 is available in Bioconductor [37] and 
implemented in R (http://​www.​aroma-​proje​ct.​org/​vigne​
ttes/​CRMAv2/).
Briefly, the CEL files were analyzed for quality after the 
program calibrated for crosstalk between allele probe 
pairs, followed by normalization for 25-mer nucleotide-
position probe sequence effects. Next, we analyzed the 
performance of robust probe-summarization, normal-
ized the PCR fragment-length effects on summary sig-
nals, and finally calculated the full-resolution total copy 
numbers. When a standard reference is used, it is often 
the average of a pool of samples CnChipEffectFile.
The reference control samples for CRMA v2 analysis 
were a) the same 50 healthy individuals of MXM; b) 30 
IBS, 30 CEU and 10 YRI. All groups were analyzed with 
the same pipeline.
We made the following comparisons: (a) MXM vs. 
MXM reference; (b) MXM vs. IBS reference; (c) MXM vs. 
CEU reference; (d) MXM vs. YRI reference; and (e) MXM 
vs. HapMap reference (CEU + YRI).
