Abstract: Wetlands store large amounts of carbon, and depending on their status and type,
they release speciﬁc amounts of methane gas to the atmosphere. The connection between
wetland type and methane emission has been investigated in various studies and utilized in
climate change monitoring and modelling. For improved estimation of methane emissions,
land surface models require information such as the wetland fraction and its dynamics over
large areas. Existing datasets of wetland dynamics present the total amount of wetland
(fraction) for each model grid cell, but do not discriminate the different wetland types
like permanent lakes, periodically inundated areas or peatlands. Wetland types differently
inﬂuence methane ﬂuxes and thus their contribution to the total wetland fraction should be
quantiﬁed. Especially wetlands of permafrost regions are expected to have a strong impact
on future climate due to soil thawing. In this study ENIVSAT ASAR Wide Swath data
was tested for operational monitoring of the distribution of areas with a long-term SW near
1 (hSW) in northern Russia (SW = degree of saturation with water, 1 = saturated), which
is a speciﬁc characteristic of peatlands. For the whole northern Russia, areas with hSW
were delineated and discriminated from dynamic and open water bodies for the years 2007
and 2008. The area identiﬁed with this method amounts to approximately 300,000 km2 in
northern Siberia in 2007. It overlaps with zones of high carbon storage. Comparison with a
range of related datasets (static and dynamic) showed that hSW represents not only peatlands
but also temporary wetlands associated with post-forest ﬁre conditions in permafrost regions.

Annual long-term monitoring of change in boreal and tundra environments is possible with
the presented approach. Sentinel-1, the successor of ENVISAT ASAR, will provide data that
may allow continuous monitoring of these wetland dynamics in the future complementing
global observations of wetland fraction.

1. Introduction
Methane (CH4) is one of the major greenhouse gases, but its surface ﬂuxes are poorly understood or
represented in climate models. Uncertainties regarding global methane sources are high, e.g., emissions
from natural wetlands are estimated to range from 20% to 40% of total global methane emission [1].
Of these wetland emissions, 10% to 30% are estimated to stem from wetland complexes at high
latitudes [2–5]. Areas at high latitudes are strongly affected by global warming and it is expected that
methane emissions from wetlands above 60◦N will rise due to permafrost thawing. To beneﬁt CH4
modelling and thus climate modelling, Riley et al. [1] suggest observational studies that improve the
spatial representation of surface properties that affect CH4 emissions, such as inundation dynamics, pH
and redox potential, and vegetation characteristics. These characteristics are directly linked to wetland
type information and their dynamics. Wetland type maps, e.g., of [6], are commonly used in climate
models but they lack information about wetland dynamics. Prigent et al. [7] provide a global product of
monthly dynamics for wetland fraction of a grid size of 0.25◦at the equator with increasing size to the
poles. Some constraints of the product are obvious for the pan-arctic region due to the global application
of the algorithm. The underlying multisensory approach underestimates small wetland patches (size
below approximately 10% of grid size) compared to 100 m resolution L-band SAR estimates [7] in
the test region of Amazon basin. This is the minimum of expected underestimation in high latitude
environments. Dribault et al. [8] and Torbick et al. [9] recently improved the derivation of hydrological
wetland dynamics using high resolution remote sensing data.
The complex methods reached high
accuracies representing the hydroperiod, but the long-term wetland monitoring of continental scale that
meets climate model requirements calls for methods that are robust and simple yet generating detailed
maps covering large areas.
The ENVISAT ASAR instrument operating in Wide Swath mode provides C-band backscatter data
with a spatial resolution of 150 m. Thus, small tundra ponds and wetland patches can be captured,
which are smaller than the resolution of coarse to medium resolution satellite data (about 25 km to
500 m). Open water bodies can be mapped efﬁciently and accurately using ENVISAT ASAR WS data
as described in [10]. In continuation of that study, the approach has shown high applicability to derive
the inundation dynamics of the boreal and tundra environments [11]. The method was modiﬁed in this
study to test the applicability of ASAR WS annual time series to derive areas permanently saturated with
water to complement the water bodies product with additional information about the spatial distribution
of further wetland related ground features. Temporal variations of radar backscatter can be attributed
Remote Sens. 2012, 4
2925
to near surface soil moisture dynamics as shown in many studies (e.g., [12–14]). Previously, peatland
classiﬁcations have been available from ENVISAR ASAR Global Mode data (resolution of 1 km [15,16])
which identiﬁed 76% of oligotrophic and mixed peatlands compared to the West Siberian Lowlands
(WSL) database [17]. Mixed pixels occurring in northern areas due to the high number of small ponds
however impede the identiﬁcation of peatlands located between 70◦E and 77◦E at this spatial resolution.
These wetlands could only be identiﬁed indirectly by utilizing the characteristic delay in melt water
drainage occurring in that region [15]. In this study ENIVSAT ASAR Wide Swath data was tested for
operational monitoring of the distribution of areas with a long-term SW near 1 (hSW) in northern Russia
(SW = degree of saturation with water, 1 = saturated). For the whole northern Russia, areas with hSW
were delineated, as well as open water bodies, for the years 2007 and 2008.
The areas derived in this study, which are characterized by high soil moisture with little changes over
the year, can be any kind of land cover that inherits this special soil moisture characteristic. Actual
ground conditions have been investigated using seven different land cover and speciﬁc wetland datasets.
When expressed as a fraction of speciﬁc grid cells, such information could be used as data input, e.g.,
for land surface models.
2. Material and Methods
Dynamics of inundation can efﬁciently be mapped by active microwave sensors [11]. The radar beam
is reﬂected specularly off the smooth water surface, and thus recorded backscatter is expected to be
below a speciﬁc threshold. Higher backscatter in contrast is recorded, when the reﬂection is diffused by
the surrounding surface consisting of other land cover classes or, depending on the wavelength, when a
water surface is roughened by wind or rain. When the soil or vegetation is moist, as in peatlands, the
backscatter is higher than under dry conditions, due to the sensitivity of the radar signal to dielectric
properties and thus water content (e.g., [18]). Oligotrophic peatlands (vegetated with Sphagnum) have a
high backscatter that is composed by the high dielectric component of the moist moss and the underlying
soil. This allows discrimination from other land cover classes with respect to a slow annual change of
these conditions within the areas of interest during the snow free period. Data acquired during the snow
covered period is masked out using the ASCAT freeze/thaw product [19,20].
2.1. ENVISAT ASAR Wide Swath Data
The European Space Agency’s ENVISAT platform provides the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar
(ASAR) instrument with C-band sensor (centre frequency at 5.331 GHz). It is able to operate in several
modes of different spatial resolutions. The data used in this study are recorded in HH (horizontal emitted
and horizontal received) polarization only. Operating in Wide Swath mode (WS), the sensor has a spatial
resolution of approximately 150 m and a temporal resolution of 2–3 days in high latitudes, considering
acquisitions with varying viewing geometry. The coverage at high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere
is documented in [11]. It covers the pan-arctic region with increasing acquisitions per month towards
the pole. Up to 50 acquisitions per month can be reached in northern Eurasia. All scenes acquired
in a speciﬁc period can be used in the approach by using time series statistics for hSW area extraction.
Therefore weather conditions do not affect the classiﬁcation accuracy when mapping hSW areas. Prior to
Remote Sens. 2012, 4
2926
classiﬁcation the data needs to be pre-processed. This includes a radiometric calibration, geocoding and
the modelling of the backscatter coefﬁcient σ0 (in dB). The ASAR WS data are adjusted to a reference
incidence angle of 30◦[21]. The data set is subdivided into tiles of approximately 3,000 km2 each for
better processing performance and projected into the Universal Polar Stereographic (UPS) coordinate
system to reduce disk space [11].
2.2. Study Area
The regions investigated in this study are located in Siberia, Russia (Figure 1), and cover the West
Siberian lowlands (WSL) including parts of the Ob river basin and Yamal peninsula as well as the
Lena river basin including the delta. Both areas (No. 11 and 12 in Figure 1) are focus regions of
the European Space Agencies ALANIS Methane project (http://www.alanis-methane.info) and have
been therefore investigated in detail. The area over the West Siberian lowlands spans from 60◦E to
80◦E and 55◦N to 73◦N. The area of the Lena basin is located between 115◦E and 134◦E and between
60◦N and 73◦N with mostly continuous permafrost (Figure 2). The WSL possess over 900,000 km2 of
peatlands [22] including the largest of the world [23] with high amounts of carbon stored. The WSL
is located in the zones of continuous, discontinuous, sporadic and isolated permafrost (Figure 3). The
climate in the region is cold to continental and precipitation ranges from 510 to 590 mm/year. The
region is characterized by Tundra and Taiga vegetation including thermokarst ponds, peatlands, rivers
and ﬂoodplains (Figure 3). It is expected that thawing is turning peatlands from carbon sink to carbon
source [24], by enabling anaerobic processes, but the amount of released methane depends on the height
of the water table [25]. For low water table, a raised drainage of unfrozen soil lowers the water table and
leads to carbon release as CO2 mainly. For high water table, impeded drainage due to landscape collapse
leads to a high water table and carbon release as CH4 mainly.

2.3. Saturated Areas Mapping
Open peatlands can be identiﬁed with C-band SAR due to their higher moisture content and thus
higher backscatter [15,27]. The backscatter of long-term saturated areas is therefore high in a single
image, but not always separable from high backscatter caused by other land cover at that time step.
Other high but short-term backscatter sources can be wet surfaces due to recent rain, or the shorelines
of drying ponds. Assuming that peatland areas change more slightly over the year than other areas, they
show seasonal backscatter statistics distinct from other land cover classes [27]. Other land cover features
with a long-term hSW and thus similar seasonal backscatter statistics are ﬂoodplains (which stay moist
when the groundwater table is high) or water accumulations due to recent forest ﬁres [28,29]. Forest
ﬁres lead to darkened soil with a reduced albedo causing the associated thawing of upper soil layers
when occuring in permafrost regions. It is hypothesized that the resulting increased surface wetness
can be captured with the use of SAR data. The data processing (Figure 4) to derive hSW areas, as
well as additionally the maximum inundation of open water bodies, was conducted using the seasonal
backscatter statistics of ENVISAT ASAR Wide Swath C-band time series data in combination with a
decision tree classiﬁcation algorithm. In addition to the statistical measures, the slope calculated from
the circumpolar DUE Permafrost Digital Elevation Model [30] was used.
Figure 4. Schematic representation of the classiﬁcation method to derive hSW areas.
The minimum and maximum of time series data (Method 1) were chosen under the assumption that
areas of peatlands have higher dB values than most other land cover classes at these speciﬁc statistic
measures [27]. They were calculated pixel-wise from all available datasets within the time series period
Remote Sens. 2012, 4
2929
of May to September (t1 = ﬁrst date, tn = last date) of the years 2007 and 2008. A second method
(Method 2) using the 5th and 95th percentiles calculated from the time series data instead of the minimum
and maximum measures was tested in the decision tree method. This approach has already been shown
suitable for relative surface soil moisture retrieval from SAR [14]. Artifacts (mainly caused by errors
in the level 1b data that was downloaded from ESA rolling archive) and effects of multiple bounce
backscatter and/or outliers are expected to be reduced (Figure 5). The value margins for hSW areas and
open water bodies (maximum inundation) were deﬁned based on literature [27] and quantitative testing.
The classes were analyzed in the Ob and Lena river basin and delta regions with a spatial resolution of
150 m, 75 m nominal resolution. The data range for hSW areas has been found to lie approximately
between −10 dB and −5 dB (minimum or 5th percentile, exempliﬁed in Figure 6 (middle)) and −2.5 dB
and −5 dB (maximum or 95th percentile, exempliﬁed in Figure 6 (left)) in case of normalization of
σ0 to 30◦in tundra as well as boreal environment. This range is used in the automated classiﬁcation
procedure with Method 2 to process all ALANIS methane mosaics. Pixels were identiﬁed as hSW areas
only when the slope was <2◦(based on [30]), as these areas, including peatlands, are assumed to be
found only in locations with a slope below 2◦. Thereby hSW areas could be discriminated from bare
mountain ridges that may have similar backscatter values. The class water bodies was assigned when
the slope was <2◦and the 5th percentile was < −14 dB. Areas which are frozen or undergo snowmelt
according to TU Vienna’s Freeze/Thaw product [19,20] were masked prior to classiﬁcation. Masking
snowmelt is an important step for the extraction of the hSW areas, as otherwise backscatter statistics
may be affected by other scattering behaviour as from wet snow (confusion with open water [11]) or
frozen conditions (confusion with dry soil [31]). In addition, the tiles of the mosaics are processed using
different time periods according to their latitude to increase the robustness of masking, especially during
spring. Speciﬁcally, with descending latitudes, the tiles of the mosaics were processed starting earlier in
the year, due to progressing snowmelt.

2.4. Validation
Datasets representing wetland dynamics for validation of the required thematic resolution and spatial
distribution do not exist for the Siberian region. Thus, an accuracy assessment could only be conducted
for a subset of the region (Extent: SV in Figure 3). Additionally, the annual maps were compared against
the datasets listed in Table 1.

3. Results
The maximum inundation of open water bodies and hSW areas as they occur in peatland ecosystems
could be mapped for the whole Northern Eurasian region (Figure 1). In the Ob test region approx.
The detected hSW areas were 170,000 km2, which equates to 8.2% of total area. In Lena test region,
approximately 17,000 km2 of hSW areas were detected, which equates to 1.2% of total area. Wide
distribution of hSW areas also occur in mosaic 1 (7.6%), which is attached to the east of the Ob region,
and in mosaic 7 (2.2%), which is part of the North Russian Lowland (Figure 7). The saturated area
decreases from year 2007 to 2008 in most mosaics.

The hSW areas show different distributions in the biomes of tundra and taiga and the transition zones,
as shown in Figures 8 and 9. The distribution of hSW area at the used scale is none or low in tundra, and
rises from pre-tundra (transition zone) over middle taiga to southern taiga. Spatially, the mapped regions
can be mostly assigned to oligotrophic peatlands with Sphagnum ﬂora (Russian classiﬁcation system) or
partly to non-forested peatlands (U) of the Ramsar classiﬁcation system as the comparison against other
products has shown. The peatland fraction, which is derived with raised threshold values at the 95th
percentile, can be attributed most likely to multiple bounce backscatter (e.g., settlements). The beneﬁt
of this approach for artifact ﬁltering leads to loss of some hSW area (Figure 10).

4. Assessment and Discussion
The comparison against the products described in Table 1 showed the following results:
1. Compared with the Wetland type map [17], mainly oligotrophic and mixed peatlands were mapped.
However, only 23% of the oligotrophic peatlands coincided with hSW areas. Seventy percent of
the peatland classes in [17] is classiﬁed as “other” with the approach of this study. Since in the
approach of this study only hSW areas are mapped (and not peatland), local and regional variations
in the surface and soil moisture are expected between years. The difference in spatial resolution
more reasonably explains the low overlap of identiﬁed peatlands. The high resolution mapping
with SAR distinguishes smaller wetland patches from each other and from surrounding land cover.
These small variations or land cover changes are not captured in the generalized maps, which are
the source of the WSL database. This is supported by the fact that a large number of small ponds
do not occur in the classiﬁcation in [17] (Figure 11). Thus, the map in [17] might be overestimating
oligotrophic peatland.
2. Areas classiﬁed as hSW show a mean soil carbon content of 46 kg·C·m−2 when compared with
the Soil Organic Carbon Map [32], while regions with abundant open water bodies and seasonally
inundated areas show a mean of 30 kg·C·m−2 and other land cover 33 kg·C·m−2. Recognized
wetland locations point to signiﬁcant accumulation of organic carbon, which is a potential source
of methane (see Figure 8).
3. A direct comparison of hSW areas with the GBFM map shows signiﬁcant differences in some
areas. The major class of the GBFM map contained by the classiﬁed hSW area of the decision
tree approach of this study is class 4 (‘forest med’). Kropacek et al. [33] deﬁne the class of
bogs as follows: “The surface of bogs is usually formed by open water, grass, shrubs and even
patches of woods. The association of a single backscatter class to bogs is therefore not possible.
The class wetlands in the classiﬁcation of this study represents areas of wet soil covered with
Remote Sens. 2012, 4
2934
low biomass vegetation.” This land cover map focuses on forest classiﬁcation not primarily on
wetlands. Although L-band backscatter is able to penetrate the forest vegetation and is therefore
able to map temporarily inundated forests, the class deﬁnition constrains mapping of hSW area. In
a ten years period, land cover changes are likely to occur (GBFM: 1996/97, saturated area: 2007).
The maps were thus compared with the ESA DUE Permafrost burnt area map [38] to investigate
differences between the maps. In the test region of the Lena basin, ﬁre events caused a new forming
of hSW area in former forest areas (Figure 12). This region is underlain by continuous permafrost
(see Figure 2). Two Landsat images (RGB 3-2-1, path 127, row 14, before (2005-06-27) and after
(2007-07-03) forest ﬁre) show a similar structure.
4. The Great Vasyugan Mire of alternating mire phytocoenoses, located between the Iksa and Bakchar
Rivers [39], is well covered by the classiﬁcation of the hSW area (Figure 13). Differences in
classiﬁcations can be explained by 8 years of time difference or different weather conditions in
these years (e.g., wetter in 2007), or confusion with forests or herbaceous land cover.
5. The hSW area distribution was compared against the Regional Wetland Product in the transects
(Figure 3) of the Ob and the Lena test regions. The regional wetland product provides the areal
extent of wetland for the boreal zone for one year (from July 2007 to June 2008), on an equal
area grid of 25 km (equal area grid of 0.25◦at the equator), with a 10-day temporal sampling [7].
The comparison which included the dynamics of open water of [11] conﬁrms that open water
surfaces are underestimated in areas with tundra ponds in the regional product. The differences
over the Lena Delta are however strongly impacted by masking of the Lena river channels. In
boreal areas, the ASAR WS information on saturated and open inundated areas enables the
discrimination between the different components that contribute to the regional wetland fraction
(compare Figure 9).
6. The Inventory of Wetland Area [35] distinguishes classes with respect to land cover compositions,
e.g., tree cover and pools, which result in wetland complexes.
Wetland complexes agree in
most parts with the classiﬁcation of this study (compare Figure 14:
“forested shrubs- and
moss-dominated mires” agree with ”areas with high degree of saturation”, “sphagnum dominated
bogs with pools and open stand trees” agree with regions with a mixture of “water bodies” and
“areas with high degree of saturation”.) Bartsch et al. [10] suggested the use of metrics such as
water bodies density for tundra wetland complex retrieval. A combined use of those two classes
may lead to the delineation of classes as used in [35]. Validation problems with the data set occur
due to different acquisition date of underlying imagery, spatial detail and the thematic resolution.
7. Geo-Wiki ([36,37], http://www.geo-wiki.org/) is an on-line tool to visualize and validate spatial
datasets based on the Google Earth imagery (http://www.google.com/earth/). Besides imagery,
Geo-Wiki provides some additional information that help to validate a dataset: land cover class by
GLC2000, MODIS land cover and GlobCover as well as NDVI seasonal proﬁle. In the particular
case study, we have checked 465 points randomly distributed over a subset of the hSW area
classiﬁcation (Extent: SV in Figure 3) whether wetlands are observed there or not. Eighty percent
of validation points conﬁrm our area of hSW area. Taking into account a subset of validation points
with a high reliability on distinguished land cover, we got an accuracy of 86%. The underlying
Google Earth imagery was taken in 2005/2006.

A known problem in using ASAR WS data for water bodies mapping is the restraining factor of
weather conditions (rain and wind) due to its speciﬁc wavelength. More than 50% of the acquisitions
can be affected in this environment [11]. This is however not a constraint for identiﬁcation of hSW areas.
Thus, no pre-selection of scenes regarding weather conditions is needed. Furthermore, statistics of time
series were used to deduct error values. Compared with the min/max method, the percentile classiﬁcation
assigns 1% less area to water bodies but results in reduced artifacts (Figure 5). Regarding the hSW areas,
the percentile method assigns 3.5% less area to that class than the min/max method (Figure 10). The
parameterization of the decision tree is applicable in both tundra and taiga environments as well as in
both study sites Lena and Ob and the pan-arctic region.
The areas mapped are characterized by a high backscatter not changing over the snow free season.
The comparison against other wetland/land cover products of the region shows the potential of the hSW
areas maps. A nominal resolution of 75 m is suitable to map smaller wetland patches as they often occur
in highly heterogeneous wetland landscapes. Apart from the spatial distribution of the classiﬁed features,
which overlap or correspond with the independent peatland classiﬁcations, the speciﬁc high backscatter
resulting from high near surface soil moisture is a strong indicator for peatlands. Bartsch et al. [27]
compared the seasonal variations of soil moisture of different wetland and other land cover types of the
boreal biome over a time period of a year. They found speciﬁc soil moisture dynamics with a long term
high backscatter for wetlands with high moor peat and peat/podzol in contrast to short(er) term high
backscatter for muck-peat gley. Although the mapped areas are deﬁned as hSW areas, they may mainly
represent oligotrophic peatlands, as the validation has shown. Areas containing high amounts of carbon
are detected and discriminated from water bodies, what is of high importance for climate modelling
concerning future methane release from peatlands under thawing permafrost conditions.
The decrease of hSW area between 2007 and 2008 corresponds to the observations of [40]: “The
preliminary estimate of annual river discharge to the Arctic Ocean from the major Russian rivers in 2008
was signiﬁcantly greater than the long-term mean but lower than the historical maximum observed in
2007.” Shiklomanov et al. [41] analyzed the climate conditions of 2007 based on ArticRIMS [42] and
NCEP [43] data and compared them to the long-term trend from 1980 to 2007 that demonstrates an
intensiﬁed water cycle in the pan-Arctic region. They found that precipitation in 2007 was higher in
the northern regions of the Russian Arctic Drainage System (that agree with the position of the study
regions) and lower in the southern regions compared to the long-term trend. Furthermore, 2007 was the
warmest year since 1947 in regions covering 90% of total permafrost in the Eurasian Arctic.
The high precipitation rate and warmer conditions in 2007 (which may have intensiﬁed permafrost
thawing) could have contributed to an increased water accumulation in wetland complexes. Further
reasons for area decrease could be a variation in data availability or an impact on data due to weather
disturbances during acquisition. Also errors at freeze/thaw masking can lead to varying results.
Differences in wetland extent and distribution compared to the reference maps may be attributed
to different acquisition dates of the underlying data and changing climate conditions with a resulting
land cover change. Different spatial resolutions are more likely to cause classiﬁcation variability, as
generalization leads to overestimation of the class extent. But the most reasonable explanation of the
differences might be the speciﬁc class deﬁnition of this study.
While other products map wetland
complexes (e.g., [17,35]) or water fraction [7], it is assumed in this study that characteristic features
Remote Sens. 2012, 4

of peatlands are mapped, which are areas of high soil moisture covered with a speciﬁc vegetation
(probably Sphagnum, compare peatland classiﬁcation systems in Table 2). This is demonstrated in the
highly differentiated classiﬁcation of Vasyugan Mire (Figure 13) where the ASAR WS classiﬁcations
mainly corresponds to Herb.Wetland, Shrub.Wetland and Tree.Needleleaved.Evergreen.Open.Wetland
class with 33% to 42% (Figure 15). Less hSW area falls into the adjacent wetland classes Tmow, Tmcw
and Tnecw (see Figure 15 for coding and %). Of the non-wetland classes, 6% to 15% overlap with the
ASAR WS classiﬁcation.

Eutrophic peatland distributions are expected to be less detectable with this method. The speciﬁc
backscatter of dense, growing reed beds of Phragmites in combination with a changing water table
requires a more complex classiﬁcation scheme.
The validation activities could be extended by comparison against the wetland dataset by [44],
who assessed the distribution and dynamics of inundated wetlands in boreal and arctic environments
to construct a global scale Earth System Data Record (ESDR) of Inundated Wetlands that may be
complementary to the saturated area information.
5. Conclusions
In this study a decision tree method applied on backscatter time series data of ENVISAT ASAR
WS was tested. The study presented was conducted in the context of using Earth Observation data
for evaluating estimates of methane releases of a land surface model, the Joint UK Land Environment
Simulator (JULES; [46,47]). ASAR WS data are applicable over large regions for the identiﬁcation of
areas with a long-term high degree of water saturation (hSW areas). The advantages of C-band data
are the increased coverage and data availability, compared to L-band instruments. A limiting factor
is the shorter wavelength, thus the detectability of forested wetland patches is impacted by a limited
penetration to the ground in forest.
Confusion with other classes such as build-up areas has been
addressed using seasonal backscatter statistics. The hSW area total is 3.5% larger without this step
in the classiﬁcation scheme. The classiﬁcation method is designed for processing large data sets and
can be used on any ASAR WS time series covering at least summer and early autumn seasons in the
pan-arctic region. The test region chosen offers a good data coverage [11] and extensive peatland. It
was therefore suitable to investigate the application potential of the data and for developing a monitoring
scheme. Validation data are however scarce. Seven independent data sources at different scale and
thematic detail have been compared to the classiﬁcation result. Bartsch et al. [11] showed that C-band
data is suitable to monitor open water dynamics when sufﬁcient acquisitions are available. Here we show
that they can be also utilized to distinguish inundation from areas highly saturated with water, as typical
for peatland (86% agreement by use of GeoWiki). It allows conclusions regarding the distribution of
oligotrophic peatlands including their moisture status. Moreover, distribution patterns can be derived,
which are of interest for ecological and geomorphological research. The data set can be also utilized
for renaturation/regeneration monitoring of burnt areas. A subdivision of wetland fraction dynamics
into different contributing wetland classes could help to better model methane ﬂuxes that are strongly
affected by wetland characteristics. ASAR WS data products are suitable to provide such information.
Variations in the thresholds used in the classiﬁcation should be further tested with respect to the actual
sensitivity of C-band SAR to moisture changes.
The ENVISAT data is available only from 2003 to spring 2012. The ASAR acquisition strategy
has been also an obstacle for spatially and temporal consistent monitoring applications.
There are
however plans for a follow-up mission that aims on operational services. The European Space Agency
in collaboration with the European Union is developing the Sentinel-1 mission to be launched in 2013
to beneﬁt the GMES user services. The polar-orbiting satellites will ensure the continuity of C-band
SAR-data [48]. A continuous mapping of hSW area distribution and change would be enabled.
