Abstract
The world is undergoing a process of fast and unprecedented urbanisation. It is
reported that by 2050 66% of the entire world population will live in cities. Although
this phenomenon is generally considered beneﬁcial, it is also causing housing crises
and more inequality worldwide. In the past, the relationship between design features
of cities and socio-economic levels of their residents has been investigated using
both qualitative and quantitative methods. However, both sets of works had
signiﬁcant limitations as the former lacked generalizability and replicability, while the
latter had a too narrow focus, since they tended to analyse single aspects of the urban
environment rather than a more complex set of metrics. This might have been caused
by the lack of data availability. Nowadays, though, larger and freely accessible
repositories of data can be used for this purpose. In this paper, we propose a scalable
method that delves deeper into the relationship between features of cities and
socio-economics. The method uses openly accessible datasets to extract multiple
metrics of urban form and then models the relationship between urban form and
socio-economic levels through spatial regression analysis. We applied this method to
the six major conurbations (i.e., London, Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool, Leeds,
and Newcastle) of the United Kingdom (UK) and found that urban form could explain
up to 70% of the variance of the English oﬃcial socio-economic index, the Index of
Multiple Deprivation (IMD). In particular, results suggest that more deprived UK
neighbourhoods are characterised by higher population density, larger portions of
unbuilt land, more dead-end roads, and a more regular street pattern.

1 Introduction
Cities are growing faster than ever before. In 1950, only 30% of the total world population
was living in cities. Today, this datum stands around 54%. By 2050, the estimates project
that 66% of the total world population will be urban, with cities in developing countries
attracting the greatest number of new city dwellers [1]. Urbanisation is regarded by insti-
tutions and governments as a positive phenomenon as it brings, for example, better and
less costly public services and improved living standards due to the concentration of eco-
nomic activities [2]. However, this very same phenomenon is also reported to bring more

inequality worldwide, with some areas beneﬁting more from public investments and eco-
nomic growth than others [3]. It is thus necessary to develop a better understanding of
the relationship between physical features of the urban environment and socio-economic
levels of city dwellers, to inform urbanists and city planners.
Urban form had been investigated extensively in the past, in relation to socio-economics
and well-being. Jacobs, for example, observed diﬀerent parts of her city (i.e., New York)
and reached the conclusion that the traditional, compact, pedestrian-friendly city form
would have ensured the overall well-being of city dwellers [4]. Swiss architect Le Corbus-
ier formulated a theory based on his personal perspective and reached an opposite con-
clusion, instead. In his view, the optimal city form was dispersed and more car-oriented
[5]. The main limitation of these works lies in the use of qualitative methodologies which
render studies diﬃcult to repeat, and outcomes to generalise. More recently, researchers
adopted quantitative methods to study the relationship between features of the urban en-
vironment and socio-economic aspects (see, for example, [6] and [7]). The main limita-
tions of these works is that they analysed relatively small geographic areas (e.g., single
neighbourhoods) and focused on single aspects of the urban environment (e.g., place ac-
cessibility) despite the fact that urban form is, by deﬁnition, the interplay of multiple ele-
ments and these should be thus studied together to best capture the socio-economics of
city neighbourhoods.
The choice of using qualitative methods or analysing single metrics might have been
dictated by the lack of available data. In the last decade, though, large data repositories
and new techniques of data collection (e.g., crowd-sourcing) have become readily avail-
able (i.e., “open data revolution” [8, 9]). Researchers have recently started to take advan-
tage of this and study cities through quantitative methods. For example, they analysed
crowd-sourced visual perceptions of diﬀerent urban environments in relation to socio-
demographic factors [10] and urban qualities, such as beauty [11].
Inspired by this set of works, which analysed urban form in a more comprehensive man-
ner, and by taking advantage of the “open data revolution” too, we propose a quantitative
method that uses openly accessible datasets and spatial regression analysis to study the re-
lationship between multiple features of urban form and socio-economic indexes. Unlike
previous works, our method (i) relies on multiple descriptors of the urban environment
and (ii) can be applied to cities of diﬀerent sizes and repeatedly over time, at almost no
cost.
To test the proposed method, we applied it to the UK major urban areas as identiﬁed by
an oﬃcial document (i.e., London, Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool, Leeds, and New-
castle) [12]. Both features of urban form and information on the socio-economic levels
of their communities were extracted from openly accessible datasets. The former were
extracted from Ordnance Survey (OS) VectorMap District and OpenStreetMap (OSM),
while the latter was obtained from the English IMD database. Outcomes of the spatial
models could explain between 27% and 70% of the variance of IMD, conﬁrming the ex-
istence of a relationship between urban form and socio-economics across the six cities.
Furthermore, we found some aspects of urban form to have similar behaviours across the
case studies thus highlighting some common patterns. In particular, more deprived neigh-
bourhoods of urban UK were found to be characterised by higher population density, more
unbuilt land, a higher presence of dead-end roads, and a more regular street pattern. The
method proposed in this paper and its outcomes can be helpful in the current urbanisa-

tion age as they constitute a data driven basis for reasoning on possible design schemes
and urban policies.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. We ﬁrstly illustrate related works.
We then present our method, starting from the metrics of urban form and the concept
of socio-economic index, and by then following with the type of analysis conducted. We
discuss the results of its application to the six UK cities under study, before oﬀering our
interpretations. We conclude with ﬁnal remarks and limitations.
2 Related works
As we presented in the Introduction, the relationship between urban form and socio-
economic outcomes has been investigated in a variety of ways. Several authors used qual-
itative methods based on observation or personal views. These authors can be subdivided
in two schools of thought: those supporting the compact, pedestrian city form and those
favouring more spread out and car-oriented urban environments. Jacobs belongs to the
former group as she supported the features of the traditional city, that is medium to high
built density, perimeter blocks, walk-ability, and mixed-use [4]. Similarly, Whyte praised
human scale streets, walk-ability, and argued that subtle urban details, such as shop wid-
ows, porticoes, steps, and doorways, were indispensable for city liveability [13]. Gehl is on
the same page and favours pedestrian mixed-use streets, as well as active city edges (i.e.,
block frontages), which, in his view, can promote social interactions as well as stimulate
commercial activities [14]. The other school of thought was openly against the traditional
city form instead. Le Corbusier, for example, deemed it as disordered, chaotic, and un-
healthy [5]. He proposed a city based on super blocks (i.e., urban blocks of big dimension)
delimited by multi-lane highways and residential tower blocks retracted from the side-
walks and laid out in open space (the so-called “towers in the park”). Similarly, Hilber-
seimer despised the traditional city form and proposed plans characterised by a grid of
highways and repetitive, tall residential blocks aligned to them [15]. Although these works
presented insightful perspectives, they lack generalizability as they were based on qualita-
tive methods. Moreover, they are hardly replicable as mostly based on personal views and
observations.
More recently, thanks to the diﬀusion of computers and Geographic Information Sys-
tems (GIS), the study of cities has become also quantitative. Vaughan et al., for example,
adopted a renowned technique for the analysis of street networks (i.e., Space Syntax [16])
to study the relationship between integration (i.e., a measure of spatial accessibility) and
socio-economic levels of East London residents [6]. The researchers reported that more
accessible places, such as main streets, were associated with more aﬄuent residents while
less accessible ones, such as back streets and interstitial spaces, were related to less advan-
taged citizens. Other scholars focused on urban form and criminal activity and studied
the relationship between dwelling typologies and crime occurrences in a London bor-
ough [17]. They found the ﬂat to be the safest house type. Researchers also separately
investigated density in relation to crime; however, they found discordant outcomes. Some
reported absence of any relationship [18, 19], while a more recent work found that density
was overall beneﬁcial against crime [17]. Hillier studied whether a speciﬁc conﬁguration
of the street network, that of cul-de-sac, was associated with more or less crimes in a Lon-
don neighbourhood. Results suggested that cul-de-sac did not attract more crimes than
other spatial conﬁgurations when integrated in a street network with signiﬁcant through

movement and many properties facing the streets [7]. Other researchers focused on the
relationship between social aspects of urban life and the conﬁguration of cities. Similar
to density, outcomes were contrasting. Some scholars reported that higher densities im-
proved social interactions [20] and that lower densities not only decreased social ties, but
also favoured more car-oriented behaviours [21]. Contrary to this, other researchers found
that higher densities diminished the will of people to socialize and increased stress [22–
24]. Although these studies were based on quantitative methods rather than qualitative
ones, ﬁndings are still hardly generalizable as the geographic contexts under study were
limited (e.g., a single neighbourhood, a speciﬁc city). This was mainly due to a lack of data
as most of it was proprietary and thus hardly accessible. Furthermore, these works mainly
studied separate aspects of urban form in relation to socio-economics (e.g., spatial acces-
sibility and social class in the work by Vaughan et al. [6]). However, cities are constituted
by many interrelated components, which act in synergy rather than in isolation [25, 26].
A more recent line of research exploited the increased presence of data to investigate the
relationship between the population size of multiple cities across the world and several
socio-economic indicators. For example, researchers analysed the relationship between
population size and wages, GDP, number of patents produced, number of research cen-
tres, in multiple cities across the world and found that these indicators all increased by
around 15% more than the expected linear growth [27], with some deviations due to lo-
cal, city-speciﬁc dynamics [28]. These studies clearly oﬀered important insights on the
scaling laws of urban settlements. However, they considered cities as macro-entities. Our
aim, which is aligned with the Urban Morphology discipline [25, 26], is to analyse the re-
lations between urban form and socio-economics at a much smaller scale instead, that of
city neighbourhoods and their multiple basic components (e.g., connectivity of streets,
population density). Moreover, our focus is on dynamics within cities rather than across
cities.
In the last decade, given the increased availability of open data repositories and the rise
of new data collection techniques (e.g. crowd-sourcing), the limitations associated with
paucity of data have almost disappeared. Indeed, researchers have started to analyse cities
in more comprehensive manners, for example, through the analysis of pictures, which,
by default, comprise of multiple elements of the built environment. Quercia et al. used
crowd-sourcing to ask more than 3000 respondents whether photos of diﬀerent urban
environments transmitted beauty, quietness, and happiness [11]. The researchers then
used this information to understand what visual features (i.e., colours, textures) best cor-
related with these qualities and found that the colour green was positively correlated, while
wide roads and faceless buildings were inversely correlated. Selasses et al. used the same
data collection technique (i.e., crowd-sourcing) to ask more than 7000 people to rate their
visual perceptions of street views in terms of safety, social status, and uniqueness [10].
The group of researchers then compared the responses to socio-demographic data and
found that spatial dissimilarities in the perception of safety and social status better corre-
lated with violent crimes than their absolute values. Furthermore, they found that, safety
perception being equal, these crimes were more related to areas that looked more up-
per class. Other researchers used a computer vision algorithm, that analysed time-series
street-view imagery of ﬁve US cities, to study the relationship between physical changes of
city neighbourhoods and demographic data (i.e., population density and share of residents
with college education) [29]. Results from this study suggested that: (i) neighbourhoods
Venerandi et al. EPJ Data Science  (2018) 7:4 
Page 5 of 21
more densely populated by adults with college education were more likely to undergo pro-
cesses of urban change; (ii) neighbourhoods that had better initial appearances tended to
undergo larger positive improvements; and (iii) positive neighbourhood change was asso-
ciated with proximity to the central business district and to other aesthetically attractive
neighbourhoods. Although these works analysed multiple aspects of urban form at the
same time, they focused on “point-based” data (e.g., the characteristics of the urban space
which can be seen in a single picture). What is still missing is a method that enables the
analysis of multiple aspects of urban form at an “area-based” level. We present next the
details of a method that permits this type of spatial analysis, in a scalable manner.
3 Method
The methodology we propose mainly consists of two parts: (i) computation of metrics of
urban form and socio-economics aggregated at areal level and (ii) quantitative analysis
based on spatial linear regression to understand the relationship between the features of
urban form and socio-economic levels of neighbourhoods. We present next the metrics
and the procedural steps for carrying out the analysis, before describing how we applied
it in practice.
3.1 Metrics
3.1.1 Urban form
Our method requires the computation of nine diﬀerent metrics, capturing diﬀerent as-
pects of the built environment. Five of these were derived from previous works, while
four are being proposed in this paper. The ﬁve metrics derived from previous works are:
• Connected Node Ratio (CNR). This measures the level of connectivity and
walk-ability of a street network and was derived from the work by Garrick and
Marshall [30]. CNR is computed as the ratio between the number of street
intersections that are not cul-de-sac (i.e., node degree equals to 1) and the total
number of street intersections in an area:
CNR(ak) =

i̸=1 count(ni,ak)

i count(ni,ak) ,
where CNR(ak) is the Connected Node Ratio of the area ak; count(ni,ak) represents
the number of street intersections having a degree equal to i in the area ak. We include
this metric as several diﬀerent authors, including Jacobs [4] and Gehl [14], considered
connectivity and walk-ability fundamental aspects for thriving neighbourhoods. These
not only positively aﬀected the health conditions of citizens, but also improved social
interactions, commercial activities, and provided informal protection against crime.
• Intersection Density (ID). This metric quantiﬁes the density of street intersections in
city areas. As for CNR, also ID has been extracted from the work by Garrick and
Marshall [30]. Intersection Density is computed as the ratio between the total number
of intersections lying in an area and the area of such region:
ID(ak) =

i count(ni,ak)
area(ak)
,
where ID(ak) is the Intersection Density of the area ak; count(ni,ak) represents the
number of street intersections having a degree equal to i in the area ak; area(ak)
Venerandi et al. EPJ Data Science  (2018) 7:4 
Page 6 of 21
denotes the total area, in square meters, of the city area ak. The reason for including
this metric is similar to the one stated above as ID and CNR are closely related.
Generally, a dense street network tends also to be more connected and walk-able and
thus be associated with the positive aspects mentioned above (i.e., better health
conditions, more social and economic beneﬁts, more control against crime [4, 14]).
• Percentage of Unbuilt Land (PUL). It measures the amount of land that is not covered
by buildings and was derived from previous work by Banister et al. [31]. PUL is
calculated by dividing the amount of unbuilt land in a city area, by the overall area of
such region, and by then multiplying this value by 100:
PUL(ak) = Au(ak)
AT(ak),
where PUL(ak) is the Percentage of Unbuilt Land of the area ak; Au(ak) is the unbuilt
land, in square meters, in the city area ak; AT(ak) represents the total area, in square
meters, of the city area ak. PUL provides information on the occupancy ratio of land.
Smaller values of PUL mean that there are fewer buildings on the area considered and
thus there is more unbuilt land. Conversely, greater values of PUL mean that most of
the area is occupied by buildings and a small area is left unbuilt. We include this
metric as the occupancy ratio of land was considered a relevant design aspect by
diﬀerent researchers. Modernist planners, for example, favoured few buildings
surrounded by open space (i.e., “towers in the park”) [5, 15]. Authors supportive of the
compact city form favoured a more continuous urban fabric with less unbuilt area
instead [4, 13, 14].
• Population Density (PD). It quantiﬁes how densely populated is a city area. PD is a
common statistical datum used by institutions and governments. It is computed as the
ratio between the number of residents living in an area and the area of such region:
PD(ak) = R(ak)
AT(ak),
where PD(ak) is the Population Density of the city area ak; R(ak) is the number of
residents of the city area ak; AT(ak) represents the total area, in hectares, of the city
area ak. PD together with PUL provides information on how built density is
distributed across an area. For example, a neighbourhood with a big portion of unbuilt
land and a high population density is likely to be characterised by residential towers.
Conversely, a neighbourhood with small unbuilt surface and a high population density
is likely to be characterised by perimeter blocks.
• Betweenness Centrality (BC). It measures the level of centrality of streets. To be more
speciﬁc, BC is based on the concept that a street is central if it is included in many of
the shortest paths linking pairs of nodes (street intersections) in a street network. The
formula for computing BC can be found in the work by Porta et al. [32]. BC is usually
computed for street segments. However, since our method focuses on areas rather
than streets, we aggregate BC by considering the maximum value for each area. We
argue that the maximum value of BC can be representative of the level of spatial
accessibility of diﬀerent areas with respect to the overall urban region. The formula
Venerandi et al. EPJ Data Science  (2018) 7:4 
Page 7 of 21
for aggregating BC for areas is as follows:
BC(ak) = max(BCα),
with α a street segment contained in ak,
where BC(ak) is the BC value of the area ak and max(BCα) represents the maximum
value of BC of a street segment contained in ak. We include BC as previous works
showed it to be associated with positive aspects of cities such as employment density
[33], agglomeration of economic activities [34], and street quality [35].
We present next four metrics of urban form that we propose in this paper to complement
the previous ones:
• Percentage of Green Areas (PGA). This metric quantiﬁes the amount of public green
space available in a city area. It is computed by dividing the amount of green space in
an area by the total area of such region and by then multiplying this value by 100:
PGA(ak) = Ag(ak)
AT(ak),
where PGA(ak) is the Percentage of Green Areas of the city area ak; Ag(ak) is the
amount of green areas, in square meters, in the city area ak; AT(ak) represents the
total area, in square meters, of city area ak. We include this metric as several authors
deemed the presence of greenery an important aspect for city neighbourhoods.
Jacobs, for example, argued that parks and garden positively aﬀected city liveability.
However, she also pointed out that they could potentially have negative eﬀects,
particularly in terms of safety, if these were relegated to peripheral areas with low
densities [4].
• Irregularity of the Street Network (ISN). It measures to what extent the street network
of a speciﬁc city area is irregular. ISN is computed by dividing the standard deviation
of the node degrees associated with the intersections lying within an area by the
average node degree relative to the same intersections:
ISN(ak) = σ(ak)
μ(ak),
where ISN(ak) represents the Irregularity of the Street Network in the city area ak;
σ(ak) is the standard deviation of the node degrees, in the area ak; μ(ak) represents
the average of the node degrees, in the area ak. Intuitively, a small ISN reﬂects an area
with a small variation in node degrees, for example, an area characterised by a grid
layout, where the majority of street intersections are four-way ones. Conversely, a
great ISN corresponds to an area with a greater variation in node degrees, for
example, that of an area characterised by a mix of diﬀerent street intersections (e.g.,
cul-de-sac, three-way intersections, four-way intersections, six-way intersections). We
consider this metric as the conﬁguration of the street network was another aspect
deemed important for city liveability by several authors. For example, Jacobs generally
favoured the grid layout [4]. However, she also argued that this had to be interrupted
by squares or diagonal roads as, in her view, these urban elements would have oﬀered
“visual interruptions” that enhanced urban life.
Venerandi et al. EPJ Data Science  (2018) 7:4 
Page 8 of 21
• Dead-end Density (DD). It measures the density of dead-end roads (cul-de-sac) in a
speciﬁc city area. It is calculated as the ratio between the number of cul-de-sac lying
in an area and the area of such region:
DD(ak) = count(n1,ak)
area(ak)
,
where DD(ak) is the Dead-end Density of the city area ak; count(n1,ak) represents the
total number of nodes with degree 1 (i.e., cul-de-sac), in the area ak. We chose this
metric as the presence of dead-end roads in neighbourhoods attracted the attention of
several authors. On the one hand, Jacobs argued that cul-de-sac negatively aﬀected
urban liveability as they diminished connectivity and thus the positive eﬀects linked to
it (e.g., better health and socio-economic outcomes, more safety against crime) [4].
On the other, Newman supported cul-de-sac as a reduced connectivity would have
had positive outcomes, especially in terms of safety, as fewer strangers and more
locals would have walked in neighbourhoods [36].
• Oﬀering Advantage of Historic Properties (OAHP). It quantiﬁes whether a city area
oﬀers more or less residential properties that are historic (i.e., built pre-1900),
compared to the average city area. 1900 is selected as temporal threshold as, from
roughly that point on, the modernist style started to unfold [37] and thus properties
built in the period following this year cannot be considered historic. Note that this
threshold is mainly valid for the European context. To compute this metric, we use a
formula adopted in a previous work (i.e., Oﬀering Advantage) [38] that showed to be
eﬀective in capturing variations in the oﬀering of urban elements across a city. In this
paper, Oﬀering Advantage is adapted to reﬂect to what extent a city area ak oﬀers
more historic property hi, compared to the average area. More speciﬁcally:
OA(hi,ak) =
count(hi,ak)
N
j=1 count(hj,ak)
·
N
j=1 count(hj)
count(hi)
,
where OA(hi,ak) corresponds to the Oﬀering Advantage of historic property hi in the
area ak; count(hi,ak) represents the number of historic property hi in the area ak; N is
the total number of historic properties; count(hi) is the number of historic property hi
across a whole city. OAHP can be considered a proxy for the traditional urban form.
The more an area oﬀers historic properties, the more likely is that such area is
characterised by features of the traditional compact city form (e.g., density,
connectivity, perimeter blocks). We include OAHP as compactness and distribution
of built density were deemed fundamental aspects that aﬀected urban life by several
authors. Jacobs, for example, supported the traditional compact city form as, in her
view, it enhanced social tights, commercial activities, and safety [4]. Modernist
architects, such as Le Corbusier, on the other hand, despised such city form as they
saw it as overly dense and unhealthy, and proposed more dispersed urban plans [5].
3.1.2 Socio-economic indexes
Apart from quantitatively capturing urban form by means of the nine metrics above men-
tioned, our method also requires access to an index that captures the socio-economic lev-
els of the area under study. Such indexes are ready available for many countries around
Venerandi et al. EPJ Data Science  (2018) 7:4 
Page 9 of 21
the world. Although they diﬀer in how they are computed, most of them are based on
the concept that wealth or poverty are not caused only by economic factors (e.g., income,
employment) but also by other aspects of life (e.g., education, health) and are thus com-
posite. Socio-economics indexes are usually computed at a ﬁne level of spatial granularity
in developed countries (though, they tend to be coarser in developing ones). In England
and Wales, there exists, for example, the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), [39] which
is computed by weighting seven diﬀerent domains (i.e., income, employment, education,
health, crime, barriers to housing and services, living environment), for small census areas
of approximately 1500 residents. In developing countries, there exists the Multidimen-
sional Poverty Index (MPI), [40] which is calculated as a weighted mean of three macro
domains (i.e., health, education, and standard of living) at household level.
3.2 Analytical approach
Having illustrated the metrics that our method requires, we now present the analytical
approach. This is based on spatial linear regression, as it allows to directly compare and
interpret regression coeﬃcients, and thus to measure to what extent our metrics of urban
form can explain of the variance of the socio-economic index relative to one another. The
analytical approach consists of a four-step process: (i) selection of the areal unit of anal-
ysis and computation of the metrics of urban form and socio-economics for such unit;
(ii) normalisation and scaling of the metrics to meet the assumption of linear regression
and obtain comparable regression coeﬃcients; (iii) test for collinearity to avoid overin-
ﬂated regression coeﬃcients and unexpected signs; (iv) test for spatial autocorrelation to
check for this issue and use of spatial regression in case the phenomenon is present. We
follow with more details next.
3.2.1 Spatial unit of analysis
The spatial unit of analysis is the basic geographic entity for which the metrics presented
above are computed. While there is no systematic method to select such unit, two con-
siderations should be taken into account when choosing one. First, given that some of
the metrics are based on the count of street intersections, the spatial unit should be big
enough to contain some of these elements. For example, a unit of analysis comprising of
a 500 meters by 500 meters block might not be suited for the approach proposed, as it
might not have any intersection within its boundary. Second, oﬃcial units that existed for
a long period of time are generally better suited than, for example, more grid-shaped ones.
Historical boundaries, in fact, tend to keep the morphological unity of neighbourhoods,
for example, by not cutting buildings or blocks. This provides metrics that better reﬂect
what exists in the real world. Once the spatial unit of analysis is selected, metrics of ur-
ban form and socio-economics should be computed and aggregated for such unit. Note
that the selection of any unit of analysis is aﬀected by the Modiﬁable Areal Unit Problem
(MAUP), [41] that is values of spatial variables might change based on the unit of analysis
selected for the study. This is a common issue that aﬀects spatial analyses at areal level.
We will come back to this in the Limitations.
3.2.2 Normalisation and scaling
Linear regression requires that candidate variables are normally distributed. Normalising
the metrics is thus necessary to meet this assumption. This can be achieved in diﬀerent
Venerandi et al. EPJ Data Science  (2018) 7:4 
Page 10 of 21
ways, depending on how the values of the metrics are distributed. Common normalisa-
tion techniques are exponentiation and logarithmic transformation. Scaling is required
because the metrics have diﬀerent magnitudes: some are measures of density (e.g., Pop-
ulation Density, Dead-end Density), some others are percentages (e.g., Percentage of Un-
built Land, Percentage of Green Areas). If these were regressed untransformed against
the socio-economic index, their relative regression coeﬃcients would be hard to compare
and interpret. To avoid this, our method requires the computation of the standard scores
(or z scores) associated with the normalised metrics. This can be achieved through the
following formula:
z = X – μ
σ
,
where X represents the metric raw value, μ is the mean value of such metric, and σ its
standard deviation.
3.2.3 Test for collinearity and linear model
It is possible that two or more candidate variables (the metrics of urban form) show
collinearity, that is they are strongly correlated. If strongly collinear variables are used
in a regression, it is likely that their relative regression coeﬃcients would be inﬂated or
show unexpected signs. Since this approach is based on the interpretation of such co-
eﬃcients, it is necessary to detect and discard strongly collinear variables. This can be
achieved through the computation of the Variance Inﬂation Factors (VIFs) associated with
each candidate variable. Let reg be a regression model with predictor variables v1,vi,...,vn.
The VIF of the variable vi is obtained by, ﬁrst, performing linear regression with vi as de-
pendent variable and the other variables as independent ones v1,vi – 1,vi + 1,...,vn, and,
second, by using the overall model ﬁt (i.e., R2 value) obtained at the previous step in the
following formula:
VIF =
1
1 – R2 .
If a variable has a strong linear relation with at least another one, its correlation coeﬃcient
is likely to be close to 1 and the VIF related to that variable large. A VIF equal to or greater
than 10 is a sign of a collinearity issue [42]. If the candidate variables show VIFs smaller
than 10, they can be regressed against the socio-economic index. Conversely, if the candi-
date variables have VIFs equal to or greater than 10, it is necessary to implement a stepwise
procedure that, ﬁrst, excludes the candidate variable with the highest VIF and, second, re-
peats the same process until none of the variables has a VIF equal to or greater than 10.
At the end of this procedure, the candidate variables should be devoid of collinearity and
can be regressed against the socio-economic index.
Once obtained the linear model, our method requires to check for spatial autocorrela-
tion. This phenomenon occurs when observations located near one another are correlated
or, as Tobler put it: ‘everything is related to everything else, but near things are more re-
lated than distant things’ [43]. Not considering this special dependency in linear models
can cause over-inﬂated regression coeﬃcients or unexpected signs. To check for this is-
sue, our method relies on a renowned technique in spatial studies called Moran’s test [44].
This checks whether the residuals of a regression analysis are spatially autocorrelated. The

outputs of the Moran’s test are an index I and a p-value. The former varies between -1 and
1, and can be interpreted similarly to a Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient. The latter mea-
sures the statistical signiﬁcance of the test. A negative Moran’s I means that dissimilar
values cluster together thus forming a dispersed pattern. Conversely, a positive Moran’s I
means that similar values are located near one another thus forming a clustered pattern.
If the Moran’s test is not signiﬁcant (i.e., there is no statistical evidence that the residuals
are spatially autocorrelated), the linear model can be trusted and interpreted. Conversely,
if the Moran’s test were to be signiﬁcant (i.e., there is statistical evidence of the presence
of spatial autocorrelation in the residuals), our method requires the use of a spatial model
that incorporates the overlooked spatial information. We propose the use of the Spatial
Autoregressive (SAR) model, a type of spatial model that accounts for the proximity of
observations in space by including a spatial weighting matrix in the equation [45]. To as-
certain that the SAR model accounts for all the spatial autocorrelation present in the data,
our method requires to perform again the Moran’s test. If the outputs are negative, the
SAR model can be accepted and interpreted. Conversely, if they are positive, it should be
rejected.
We present next the application of the proposed method to six UK cities.
4 Application of the method
We applied the method presented above to UK urban areas. To do so, we ﬁrst identiﬁed
what areas are considered urban. We extracted such information from an oﬃcial docu-
ment called Rural Urban Classiﬁcation [12]. In this document, areas were classiﬁed in ten
classes depending on their level of “urbanity”, with the most rural category being Hamlets
and Isolated Dwellings in a Sparse Setting and the most urban being Major conurbation.
We chose the areas classiﬁed as Major conurbation for this analysis. The resulting urban
areas corresponded to the cities of London, Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, New-
castle, and Leeds. These vary quite substantially both in socio-economic, historic, and
cultural terms and in size. London covers the vastest surface and is the most populated,
while Newcastle is the smallest and least populated of the set. We provide more infor-
mation on the six urban areas under study in Table 1 and a map with their locations in
Figure 1.
The ﬁrst step of our method consists in the computation of the nine metrics of urban
form and the socio-economic index at a suitable spatial unit of analysis. We selected the
ward as spatial unit of analysis for the present study, for two reasons. First, areas of wards
were never too small to cause issues in the computation of the metrics, yet it was small
enough to oﬀer city planners ﬁne grained units of analysis and possible intervention. Sec-
ond, wards are long standing administrative boundaries deﬁned by the UK government,
which have both electoral and ceremonial functions, and were ﬁrst implemented in the

Middle Ages [47]. We identiﬁed 847 wards for London, 238 for Manchester, 183 for Birm-
ingham, 119 for Newcastle, 100 for Liverpool, and 93 for Leeds.
Having chosen the spatial unit at which to perform our analysis, we then needed access
to openly accessible datasets from which to compute the metrics of urban form and socio-
economics. We used ﬁve of such datasets: OS VectorMap District, Dwellings by Property
Build Period and Type, the 2011 UK Census, OSM, and IMD. We present these datasets
next.
Ordnance Survey (OS) VectorMap district
This is one of the oﬃcial digital maps of the
UK [48]. It contains information on various geographic objects such as roads, building
footprints, and natural areas. The content of this dataset is generated and kept updated by
Ordnance Survey, the UK oﬃcial mapping agency, and was made freely accessible for the
ﬁrst time in 2010. The geographic information is provided in vectorial format for tiles of
100 km by 100 km. We selected the tiles corresponding to the six urban areas under study
and extracted the information needed for the computation of the metrics. We then com-
puted the degrees of each node (i.e., street intersection) in the street networks, discarded
the nodes of degree 2 (as they were not intersections but inaccuracies), and calculated
the areas occupied by buildings, in the six cities under study. Note that roundabouts have
been kept in their original shapes. This information was then used to compute six of the
nine metrics of urban form at ward level: Connected Node Ratio (CNR), Intersection Den-
sity (ID), Dead-end Density (DD), Irregularity of the Street Network (ISN), Percentage of
Unbuilt Land (PUL), and Betweenness Centrality (BC).
Dwellings by property build period and type
This database contains the count of prop-
erties in England and Wales for several build periods and housing types [49]. To be more
speciﬁc, the information on build periods is subdivided in twelve classes of around ten
Venerandi et al. EPJ Data Science  (2018) 7:4 
Page 13 of 21
years each, with the ﬁrst being the class with properties built before 1900 and the last being
the one with properties built between 2010 and 2015. This information is provided for of-
ﬁcial census areas of about 1500 residents, the Lower-layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs).
However, LSOAs are much smaller than wards (indeed too small for our analysis). The
information on build periods was thus aggregated at the level of wards by summing the
values associated with the LSOAs contained in each ward. This information was then used
to compute the metric Oﬀering Advantage of Historic Properties (OAHP).
2011 census: population and household estimates for wards and output areas in England
and Wales
This database contains information on the population density (i.e., persons
per hectare) of each ward in England and Wales [46]. This data was used to compute the
metric Population Density (PD).
OpenStreetMap
With more than three million users, OSM is probably the best known
example of geographic crowd-sourcing [50]. OSM contributors are collectively building
and keeping updated the ﬁrst free and editable map of the world. Many studies have been
carried out to ascertain the quality of its content in diﬀerent parts of the world, for example
in the UK [51], France [52], and Germany [53], and reported an overall good level of spatial
accuracy, especially in urban areas. For the purpose of this analysis, we used the OSM
dataset as source of information for public green areas. Once these were identiﬁed, we
assigned them to each of the wards of the urban regions under study and computed their
areas. This information was then used to compute the metric Percentage of Green Areas
(PGA).
Index of multiple deprivation
This dataset includes information on the socio-economic
deprivation of communities of England and Wales [39]. It is computed for LSOAs by
weighting seven diﬀerent domains: income deprivation, employment deprivation, health
deprivation, education deprivation, barriers to housing and services, crime levels, and liv-
ing environment deprivation. The higher the IMD score, the more deprived the area, and
vice versa. IMD values are normally distributed [54]. Since the spatial unit adopted in this
analysis was the ward, we aggregated IMD values at the level of such unit by averaging the
IMD values associated with the LSOAs contained in each ward. This was possible since
the variation of IMD scores of the LSOAs contained in each ward was small (i.e., their
standard deviation values were small and always smaller than their average values). This
data constituted the metric of socio-economic deprivation (IMD).
We present a summary table with metrics, relative brief descriptions, means, and stan-
dard deviations in Table 2. Choropleth maps of the metrics of urban form and IMD, for
the six cities under study, are presented in the Additional ﬁle 1. The actual values of the
metrics can be found in the Additional ﬁle 4.
5 Results
In this section, we present ﬁrst some preliminary results drawn from the observation of
the density distribution plots of the metrics of urban form and IMD. Second, we illustrate
the outcomes of the regression analyses performed for each city. Third, we oﬀer interpre-
tations for the behaviours of the regression coeﬃcients.

5.1 Preliminary results
To explore the nature of the data considered and what it meant in terms of urban form,
we produced density distribution plots for the metrics under study by applying a Gaus-
sian smoothing function to the distributions. We present these plots, for each city under
study, in Figure 2. As shown, none of the metrics were normally distributed, with only
Connected Node Ratio (CNR) showing a distribution close to the normal. The majority
of the metrics (six out of nine) showed positive skews, having most of their values close to
their respective ﬁrst quartiles. These were: Percentage of Green Areas (PGA), Intersection
Density (ID), Dead-end Density (DD), Population Density (PD), Betweenness Centrality
(BC), and Oﬀering Advantage of Historic Properties (OAHP). Irregularity of the Street
Network (ISN) and Percentage of Unbuilt Land (PUL) showed negative skews, instead,
with most of their values concentrating around their respective third quartiles. IMD also
presented a non-normal distribution (i.e., positive skew).
We drew some observations from these preliminary results. Most metrics of urban form
had similar distributions across the six cities under study. This was not surprising since the
metrics were computed for regions within the same country, which thus had been subject
to similar historic, social, and cultural phenomena. However, there were also some unique
variations. First, the urban form of London seemed to be denser in terms of built form and
population, compared to the other cities (i.e., more low values of PUL, more high values
of PD). Moreover, it seemed to be better connected (i.e., more high values of CNR, more
low values of DD) and less deprived (i.e., more low values of IMD). These ﬁndings seemed
to be in line with the research carried out by Bettencourt and West [27], who discovered a
super-linear relationship between the population size of cities and a set of urban indicators
such as income, GDP, and crime. Second, Birmingham’s urban features showed peaks of
values rather than more varied distributions. In particular, most of its neighbourhoods
seemed to have low values of ID (around 0.5), moderately high values of PUL (around
70%), and low values of OAHP (close to 0). Third, Newcastle seemed to oﬀer less green
areas than the other cities. The majority of its neighbourhoods, in fact, showed values of
PGA close to 0. Finally, Leeds seemed to be more sparsely built (i.e., more high values of
PUL) and oﬀer more historic properties (i.e., more high values of OAHP).
5.2 Linear models
After having normalised and standardised the variables of urban form, we checked
whether they were collinear through the VIF test. Outcomes of this test indeed showed
that some of the variables presented collinearity. In particular, CNR and ID were strongly
collinear in all cities, with VIFs signiﬁcantly greater than 10. PUL was found to be collinear

only in Leeds. Such variables were thus discarded from the list of candidates for the re-
gression analysis.
We then input the remaining variables in six regression models, one for each city, with
IMD as dependent variable. Model outcomes suggested that multiple features of urban
form were associated with deprivation. Models were all statistically signiﬁcant, at 99%
conﬁdence level, and generally presented moderate ﬁts, with four models out of six being
able to explain around 50% of the variance of IMD. To be more speciﬁc, urban form could
Venerandi et al. EPJ Data Science  (2018) 7:4 
Page 16 of 21
explain 50% of the variance of deprivation in Birmingham and Leeds; it could explain 49%
of the variance in London and 48% in Manchester. The explanatory power of the mod-
els for Liverpool and Newcastle was lower, instead. Urban form could explain 25% of the
variance of IMD in the ﬁrst city and only 11% in the second.
To check whether spatial autocorrelation was not aﬀecting these outcomes, we per-
formed the Moran’s test on the residuals. Outputs of such test showed statistical evidence
of the presence of spatial autocorrelation in all models. Moran’s I values were statistically
signiﬁcant, at 99% conﬁdence level, with a minimum value of 0.16 (Manchester, Leeds, and
Newcastle) to a maximum of 0.44 (London). Given the presence of spatial autocorrelation,
which could have biased regression coeﬃcients and overall model ﬁt, we implemented the
SAR technique to account for such phenomenon. SAR models were all statistically signiﬁ-
cant, at 99% conﬁdence level, and showed greater explanatory powers and smaller regres-
sion coeﬃcients, meaning that part of IMD was indeed explained by the spatial proximity
of observations. To be more speciﬁc, the model for Birmingham could explain 67% of the
variance of IMD, the one for London could explain 70%, the one for Manchester 56%, the
one for Leeds 59%, the one for Liverpool 49%, and the one for Newcastle 27%. We per-
formed a second Moran’s test to ascertain whether spatial autocorrelation did not aﬀect
the residuals of the SAR models. Outputs of such test conﬁrmed that there was no statis-
tical evidence of the presence of the issue in none of the models (i.e., p-values > 0.05). Full
results of the linear regression (LR) and SAR models can be found in Table 3. Frequency
distribution plots of the residuals of the SAR models are presented in the Additional ﬁle 2.
For informational purposes only, we also produced plots of single correlations between
metrics of urban form and IMD, for the six cities under study. These are presented in
the Additional ﬁle 3. Knowing that models were robust, we proceeded to investigate their
relative regression coeﬃcients. Common patterns are summarised below:
• Dead-end Density (DD) was statistically signiﬁcant and positively associated with
deprivation, in ﬁve cities out of six (i.e., Birmingham, London, Manchester, Liverpool,
and Newcastle);
• Irregularity of the Street Network (ISN) was signiﬁcant and negatively associated with
deprivation, in four cities out of six (i.e., Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, and
Newcastle);
• Percentage of Unbuilt Land (PUL) was signiﬁcant and positively associated with
deprivation, in four cities out of six (i.e., London, Manchester, Liverpool, and
Newcastle);
• Population Density (PD) was signiﬁcant and positively associated with deprivation, in
four cities out of six (i.e., Birmingham, London, Manchester, and Leeds).
For what concerned the remaining coeﬃcients, Betweenness Centrality (BC) was associ-
ated with deprivation in two cities out of six (i.e., London and Leeds), Oﬀering Advantage
of Historic Properties (OAHP) was related to advantaged areas in London only, while Per-
centage of Green Areas (PGA) was negatively associated with deprivation in Newcastle
only. We elaborate more on these ﬁndings next.
5.3 Interpretations
As mentioned above, several regression coeﬃcients (i.e., DD, ISN, PUL, and PD) showed
similar patterns across the cities under study. This meant that we could identify an ur-
ban form that was associated with deprivation, in the majority of the cities considered. In
four cities out of six, deprived English neighbourhoods appeared to be characterised by

high population density, vast portions of unbuilt land, numerous cul-de-sac, and regular
street patterns. This seemed to closely resemble the modernist “towers in the park” design
scheme, which saw the concentration of residents in small portions of land (i.e., residen-
tial towers laid out in open space), conspicuous presence of dead-end roads, and regular
street patterns of major roads [5, 15].
The link between these urban features and deprivation thus seemed to discredit the
modernist theories and support the ones of the compact city form [4, 13, 14], for the
UK context. Jacobs, for example, was in favour of perimeter blocks rather than isolated
residential towers as the retraction of buildings from side walks diminished social inter-
actions, as fewer points of exchange (e.g., doors, windows, porticoes) between buildings
Venerandi et al. EPJ Data Science  (2018) 7:4 
Page 18 of 21
and streets were present [4]. Furthermore, they reduced commercial activity, as there was
no physical space on the sides of streets for amenities. Finally, isolated tower blocks also
reduced safety, as streets were not informally controlled by windows facing them (the so-
called “eyes on the street” eﬀect). Similarly, she also supported well-connected streets
rather than cul-de-sac, as the latter diminished connectivity and thus also the ability of
pedestrians to move in the urban space. This aspect, in her view, was not only fundamen-
tal for the vitality of urban spaces but also for their economic prosperity and safety. She
argued that fewer pedestrians corresponded to fewer social interactions, smaller use of
amenities, and fewer “eyes on the street” to prevent crime. Finally, she supported street
networks with irregularities (e.g., diagonal roads and squares) rather than overly regular
grids. This aspect, in her view, would have provided “visual interruptions”, which enhanced
the perception of space and, ultimately, urban life.
The link between presence of cul-de-sac and deprivation seemed also to discredit the
theory proposed by Newman (i.e., cul-de-sac were beneﬁcial against crime as they reduced
passage of people thus making urban spaces more controllable [36]). Although we did not
test a pure measure of crime, a domain associated with such topic was included in the
computation of IMD.
Three more associations were found to be signiﬁcant, although not across all cities. The
relationship between BC and deprivation seemed to be linked to the detrimental eﬀects of
too much accessibility, which a recent study found to be associated with more road traf-
ﬁc [55], on people’s well-being. These negative eﬀects, in fact, could be associated with
more air and noise pollution, more congestion, and higher levels of stress. The inverse
relationship between OAHP, our proxy for the traditional urban form, and deprivation
seemed to be backed up by theories of the compact city form [4, 13, 14]. As we mentioned
earlier, aspects of the traditional urban form (e.g., density, connectivity, perimeter blocks)
were deemed fundamental for social, economic, and safety reasons. Finally, the negative
relationship between PGA and deprivation in Newcastle could be linked to the beneﬁcial
eﬀects of urban greenery on the well-being of residents. This was supported, for exam-
ple, by the study of Maas et al. who found that higher percentages of urban green were
associated with higher scores of perceived health [56].
6 Limitations
We ought to acknowledge some limitations for this work. First, urban form is not the only
factor inﬂuencing the socio-economic levels of city areas. Many other aspects are at stake,
for example, speciﬁc housing policies, economic interventions, gentriﬁcation. While it
would be impossible to account for all of these diﬀerent factors in one model, research
outcomes from other ﬁelds (e.g., demography, econometrics) can be used to contextu-
alise and interpret the results provided by the application of our method. Second, the pro-
posed approach and relative outcomes do not imply causation. For instance, this means
that, although one may ﬁnd that connectivity is associated with better socio-economic
outcomes, increasing the connectivity of a neighbourhood might not necessarily bring
actual improvements of the socio-economic conditions of the resident population. Third,
the results found for the British cities cannot be generalised as they only hold for the spe-
ciﬁc geographic regions (i.e., the six cities under study) and time frame (i.e., 2015) inves-
tigated in this work. Nonetheless, one can use the very same method to test larger areas
and diﬀerent time frames and thus extend generalisability. Fourth, the selection of the spa-
tial unit of analysis inevitably comes with the issue of the Modiﬁable Areal Unit Problem
Venerandi et al. EPJ Data Science  (2018) 7:4 
Page 19 of 21
[41]. This states that values of metrics can vary quite substantially if computed for dif-
ferent spatial units. This can clearly bias the outcomes of a spatial analysis. While there
is no systematic method to address this issue, one should be aware of this problem and
eventually test whether metrics keep similar values when tested for diﬀerent units of anal-
ysis. Fifth, this study is carried out by focusing on the relationship between urban form
and only one socio-economic indicator (i.e., IMD). This because, at the time of this study,
IMD was the only socio-economic index freely accessible at country level and thus avail-
able for multiple cities. Alternative indexes might be available. However, they might be
available for London only (e.g., the London Ward Well-being Scorea). We would like to
stress that the very same method presented in this paper can be applied to these indexes
to gain additional insights into the relationship between urban form and socio-economics.
Sixth, although researchers found that OSM provides high quality spatial information, es-
pecially in urban contexts [51–53], it might still suﬀer from data completeness biases due
to its crowd-sourced nature that tends to overlook poorer or “less attractive” neighbour-
hoods. Finally, the proposed method models the relation between aspects of urban form
and socio-economics in a linear fashion. However, it is possible that such relationships
are not linear. For example, interactions between metrics of urban form might be better
suited to explain socio-economic levels than the metrics taken separately. This warrants
a separate future investigation.
7 Conclusions
With the world undergoing a process of fast urbanisation, inequality is on the rise as some
areas are beneﬁting more than others of public fundings and international investments.
Analysing the relationship between urban form and socio-economics has thus become ur-
gent as it can assist planners and policy makers when debating how to design cities and
where to allocate resources. In this paper, we proposed a quantitative method to analyse
such relationship at scale through spatial linear regression. More speciﬁcally, the method
extracts metrics of urban form and socio-economics from openly accessible datasets. It
then identiﬁes, through regression analysis, what set of urban features are associated with
socio-economic levels of city areas. When applied to the major UK cities, the method
found that urban form could explain up to 70% of the variance of IMD, an oﬃcial depriva-
tion index. We also observed that some speciﬁc regression coeﬃcients showed common
patterns across the cities under study: high population density, vast portions of unbuilt
land, presence of cul-de-sac, and regular street patterns were all related to deprivation.
By connecting these ﬁndings to previous works, we argued that the relationship between
this speciﬁc combination of urban features and deprivation discredited modernist theo-
ries and supported theories of the traditional city form, in the UK case.
