Abstract
Background: Soybean oil is a major source of edible oil, and the domestication of wild soybean has resulted in
significant changes in oil content and composition. Extensive efforts have been made to identify genetic loci that
are related to soybean oil traits. The objective of this study was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) related to
soybean seed oil and compare the fatty acid composition between wild and cultivated soybean.
Results: Using the specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) method, a total of 181 recombinant
inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between wild soybean ZYD00463 (Glycine soja) and cultivated soybean
WDD01514 (Glycine max) were genotyped. Finally, a high-density genetic linkage map comprising 11,398 single-
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers on 20 linkage groups (LGs) was constructed. Twenty-four stable QTLs for
seed oil content and composition were identified by model-based composite interval mapping (CIM) across
multiple environments. Among these QTLs, 23 overlapped with or were adjacent to previously reported QTLs. One
QTL, qPA10_1 (5.94–9.98 Mb) on Chr. Ten is a novel locus for palmitic acid. In the intervals of stable QTLs, some
interesting genes involved in lipid metabolism were detected.
Conclusions: We developed 181 RILs from a cross between wild soybean ZYD00463 and cultivated soybean
WDD01514 and constructed a high-density genetic map using the SLAF-seq method. We identified 24 stable QTLs
for seed oil content and compositions, which includes qPA10_1 on Chr. 10, a novel locus for palmitic acid. Some
interesting genes in the QTL regions were also detected. Our study will provide useful information for scientists to
learn about genetic variations in lipid metabolism between wild and cultivated soybean.

Background
Soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) is one of the most im-
portant protein and oil crops [1], the yields of which
accounted for nearly 60% of the world’s oilseed produc-
tion in 2018 [2]. Soybean oil is mainly composed of five
fatty acids, which include palmitic acid (C16:0), stearic
acid (C18:0), oleic acid (C18:1), linoleic acid (C18:2), and
linolenic acid (C18:3), which are present at approximate
average concentrations of 10, 4, 18, 55, and 13%, re-
spectively [3, 4]. The quality of soybean oil depends on
the composition of the fatty acids, which affects the nu-
tritional value, flavor, and stability of the soybean oil.
Unsaturated fatty acids play an important role in im-
mune system regulation, blood clotting, neurotransmis-
sion,
cholesterol
metabolism,
and
the
structure
of
membrane phospholipids in the brain and retina [5].
However, unsaturated fatty acids are susceptible to oxi-
dation, resulting in an off-flavor and reducing oil shelf
life [6, 7]. Soybeans are thus currently bred to have
higher amounts of monounsaturated fatty acids (oleic
acid) and lower amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids

(linoleic and linolenic acid), which increases the oxida-
tive stability and is also better for human health [4, 8].
Soybean seed oil content and composition are con-
trolled by multiple quantitative trait loci (QTLs)/genes
and are also affected by environmental factors [9, 10].
To date, the QTLs associated with seed oil and fatty
acids in soybean have been extensively investigated [11–
19]. Since the first research attempted to discover oil
QTLs in soybean [10], more than 322 oil QTLs and 228
fatty acid QTLs have been identified across all 20 chro-
mosomes (Chr.) in the SoyBase database [20]. Among
these QTLs, some are stable and have been detected in
different bi-parental populations and environments, in-
cluding the QTL regions of 1.64–2.09 Mb and 33.35–
35.95 Mb on Chr. Twenty for seed oil content [14, 21–
25] and the QTL region of 44.58–48.58 Mb on Chr.
Fourteen for seed linolenic acid [11, 13, 24, 26]. How-
ever, most of these identified QTLs have low selection
accuracy and have not been effectively used in marker-
assisted selection (MAS) in soybean for seed oil due to
insufficient linkage disequilibrium with desirable QTL
alleles and the genetic complexity of the trait [27, 28].
With the completion of the genome sequencing of
soybean cv. Williams 82 [29] and the rapid development
of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, single-
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers have been used
to construct high-density linkage maps to identify QTL
intervals [25, 30]. Based on a high-density genetic map
consisting of 2062 SNP markers, Cao et al. (2017) identi-
fied one QTL, qOil-5, for seed oil, which was mapped to
Chr. 05, with a physical distance of 2.5 Mb [30]. Using
the Illumina Infinium BeadChip sequencing platform,
Patil et al. (2018) reported stable QTLs for oil content
on Chr. 02 (qOil_02), Chr. 08 (qOil_08), Chr. 15 (qOil_
15), and Chr. 20 (qOil_20) using 3343 polymorphic
SNPs (3 K-SNP) [25]. Specific-locus amplified fragment
sequencing (SLAF-seq) technology has been used to
construct high-density genetic maps, constituting an effi-
cient method for large-scale de novo SNP discovery and
genotyping in soybean [31, 32]. Li et al. (2017) detected
26 stable QTLs for five fatty acids using 3541 SLAF
markers with an average distance of 0.72 cM [31]. Zhang
et al. (2018) created a high-density genetic map contain-
ing 8597 SNP loci with an average distance of 0.57 cM,
from which two QTLs, qOil10–1 and qOil10–2, for oil
content were mapped [32]. In addition, some genes asso-
ciated with soybean seed oil content and composition
have been discovered through genome-wide association
studies (GWAS) by SNP genotyping [30, 33–38]. All
these genes provide useful information for the improve-
ment of seed oil in soybean breeding programs.
In soybean, the key functional genes associated with lipid
biosynthesis have been investigated, including the fatty acid
desaturase genes FAD2-1A (Glyma.10 g278000), FAD2-1B
(Glyma.20 g111000), FAD3A (Glyma.14 g194300), FAD3B
(Glyma.02 g227200), FAD3C (Glyma.18 g062000), FAD7
(Glyma.18 g202600 and Glyma.07 g151300) [39–41], 3-
ketoacyl-ACP synthase II genes (KAS II, Glyma.17 g047000
and Glyma.13 g112700) [42, 43], and the diglyceride acyl-
transferase gene DGAT (Glyma.17 g053300) [44]. However,
overexpression of a single gene could not significantly in-
crease fatty acid biosynthesis flux [45]. It seems likely that
lipid metabolism requires the regulation of multiple related
genes. Several important transcription factors have also
been found to participate in the regulation of lipid accumu-
lation by directly binding to the promoters of lipid biosyn-
thesis genes. For example, the overexpression of GmNFYA,
GmDof4, GmDof11, GmbZIP123, and GmMYB73 signifi-
cantly increases seed lipid accumulation in transgenic
plants [46–49]. Studying these factors can improve our
understanding of the mechanisms of lipid metabolism in
soybean.
Cultivated soybean seeds have an oil content of ap-
proximately 18–22%, whereas wild soybean seeds con-
tain about 8–10% oil [25]. In an attempt to identify
genes controlling seed oil content and composition,
QTL analyses for oil content between cultivated and
wild soybean need to be conducted. In the present
study, large-scale SNP markers were developed using
SLAF-seq to construct the linkage group and map the
QTLs controlling seed oil and composition using a
population of 181 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) de-
veloped from an interspecific cross between wild soy-
bean
ZYD00463
(Glycine
soja)
and
the
cultivated
soybean WDD01514 (Glycine max). Our results could
inform scientists about the genetic variation in seed
oil between wild and cultivated soybean during the
domestication process and further improve oil quan-
tity and quality by molecular breeding.
Results
Phenotypic variation
The seed oil content and five predominant fatty acid
compositions of the parents and progenies were de-
termined from 2015 to 2016 in Wuhan, Hubei Prov-
ince and Xuchang, Henan Province. Table 1 shows
that the average seed oil content of WDD01514 is
23.76%, which is approximately two-fold higher than
ZYD00463 (11.89%). In terms of seed oil composition,
WDD01514 has higher oleic acid (20.57%) and lower
linolenic acid (7.60%) content than ZYD00463, which
are 11.39 and 16.60%, respectively. Large variations in
oil content and composition were observed among
the 181 RILs, ranging from 11.36 to 13.11% for oil
content, 17.07 to 22.68% for oleic acid content, and
11.05 to 14.41% for linolenic acid content.
The normality test using the Shapiro-Wilk (w) statistic
indicated that oil content, palmitic acid, stearic acid

(except 2015/X), and linolenic acid were normally dis-
tributed with P-values > 0.05. However, oleic acid and
linoleic acid were not normally distributed (P < 0.05)
(Table 1; Additional file 1). Oleic acid was skewed to-
ward ZYD00463, while linoleic acid was skewed toward
WDD01514 (Additional file 1). Moreover, transgressive
segregation was observed in the progenies for palmitic,
stearic, oleic, and linoleic acid (Table 1; Additional file 1),
suggesting that comprehensive genetic recombination of
alleles had occurred between parents.
The broad-sense heritability (h2) of the oil and fatty acids
ranged from 80.2 to 92.0% in the combined environment,
which indicated that the genetic variations accounted for a
major proportion of the observed phenotypic variations
(Table 1). ANOVA showed that the F-value of the G × E
interaction was significant for all traits (P < 0.001). How-
ever, the F-value was less than the genotype (Table 2).
A positive correlation was observed between oil
content and oleic acid in all four environments (P <
0.01), whereas a negative correlation was observed be-
tween oil content and palmitic acid, oil content and
linolenic acid, palmitic acid and oleic acid, oleic acid
and linoleic acid, and oleic acid and linolenic acid in
all four environments (P < 0.01) (Additional file 2).
This suggested that the important genetic factors con-
trolling these traits are tightly linked.

Construction of a genetic map with SNP markers
developed using SLAF-seq
The SLAF-seq method was applied to develop SNP
markers between the two parents. Ultimately, a total of 11,
398 SNP markers distributed over 20 linkage groups
(LGs) were used to construct the genetic linkage map
(Additional files 3, Additional files 4). These SNP markers
encompassed 2913.78 cM of the soybean genome, with a
mean distance of 0.26 cM between markers. The genetic
distances of 20 LGs spanned from 126.23 cM (Chr. 11) to
226.60 cM (Chr. 03), with mean marker intervals ranging
from 0.15 cM to 0.60 cM. The largest LG (Chr. 01) con-
tained 891 SNP markers, while the smallest one (Chr. 13)
had 248 SNP markers (Additional file 5).
QTLs for oil content
A total of 22 QTLs for seed oil content were mapped in this
study (Additional file 6). Among these, seven stable QTLs
with an LOD > 3.6 were identified across multiple environ-
ments (Fig. 1; Table 3) and were mapped to Chr. 02 (qOC2_
1), 08 (qOC8_1 and qOC8_2), 15 (qOC15_1 and qOC15_2),
and 20 (qOC20_1 and qOC20_2) (Additional file 7). The
QTL qOC2_1 on Chr. 02 explained an average of 6.7% of
the phenotypic variance for oil content; qOC8_1 and qOC8_
2 on Chr. 08 explained an average of 8.9 and 6.6% of the
phenotypic variance, respectively; qOC15_1 and qOC15_2
on Chr. 15 explained 12.9 and 11.0% of the phenotypic vari-
ance on average, respectively; and qOC20_1 and qOC20_2
on Chr. 20 explained 12.2 and 19.3% of the phenotypic
variance on average, respectively. All of the QTLs showed
negative additive effects, indicating the negative effect on oil
content for the allele from the wild soybean parent
ZYD00463. In comparison with the reported QTL regions,
six QTLs, including qOC8_1, qOC8_2, qOC15_1, qOC15_2,
qOC20_1, and qOC20_2, overlapped with previous QTLs
(Fig. 2; Additional file 8). The QTL qOC2_1, which was lo-
cated within the interval of 5.08–6.27 Mb on Chr. 02, was
adjacent to the mapped QTL within the interval of 6.86–
9.67 Mb (Fig. 2; Additional file 8).
Six enzyme genes involved in lipid metabolism were
identified in these stable QTL regions (Additional file 9),
which included two pyruvate kinase genes (GmPK,
Glyma.02 g071000 and Glyma.02 g071100) within the
genomic region of qOC2_1, a 3-ketoacyl-ACP reductase
gene (GmFabG, Glyma.08 g102100) within qOC8_1, two
3-ketoacyl-CoA
synthase
genes
(GmKCS,
Glyma.15
g042500, and Glyma.15 g046300), and a 3-hydroxyacyl-
ACP
dehydrase
gene
(GmFabZ,
Glyma.15 g052500)
within qOC15–1. In addition, two transcription factor
genes that might be involved in lipid metabolism were
found within the genomic region of qOC8_2 (Add-
itional file 10), including a homeobox-leucine zipper
gene (GmZIP, Glyma.08 g124400) and a nuclear factor Y
subunit A gene (GmNF-YA, Glyma.08 g124200).
QTLs for oil composition
A total of 66 QTLs related to seed oil composition were
mapped (Additional file 6). Among these QTLs, 17

stable QTLs with an LOD > 3.6 were identified across
multiple environments (Fig. 1; Table 3). These QTLs
were mapped to Chr. 05, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, and 16 (Add-
itional file 7). For palmitic acid, four stable QTLs, in-
cluding qPA10_1 on Chr. 10, qPA13_1 on Chr. 13,
qPA15_1 on Chr. 15, and qPA16_1 on Chr. 16, contrib-
uted an average of 12.9, 8.4, 9.7, and 8.3% of the pheno-
typic variance, respectively. All of the QTLs for palmitic
acid, except for qPA15_1 and qPA16_1, showed negative
additive effects, indicating the negative effect on palmitic
acid
for
the
allele
from
the
wild
soybean
parent
ZYD00463. For stearic acid, three stable QTLs on Chr.
14, namely, qSA14_1, qSA14_2, and qSA14_3, accounted
for an average of 18.6, 16.0, and 17.0% of the phenotypic
variance, respectively. All of the three QTLs showed
negative additive effects. For oleic acid, two stable QTLs,
including qOA11_1 on Chr. 11 and qOA15_1 on Chr.
15, explained 12.3 and 19.1% of the phenotypic variance,
respectively. The additive effect of these two QTLs was
negative. For linoleic acid, four stable QTLs, including
qLA5_1 and qLA5_2 on Chr. 05 and qLA11_1 and
qLA11_2 on Chr. 11, were identified and explained an
average of 9.9, 9.6, 10.4, and 10.0% of the phenotypic
variance, respectively. Except for qLA11_1 and qLA11_2,
qLA5_1 and qLA5_2 showed negative additive effects.
For linolenic acid, four stable QTLs, namely qLNA5_1
on Chr. 05, qLNA14_1 on Chr. 14, qLNA15_1 on Chr.
15, and qLNA15_2 on Chr. 15, explained an average of
12.5, 10.0, 12.9, and 16.1% of the phenotypic variance,
respectively. All of the four QTLs had positive additive

effects, which indicated the positive effect on these alleles
from the wild soybean parent ZYD00463. Among the 17
stable QTLs for fatty acid composition, qPA10_1 (located
within 5.94–9.98 Mb) did not overlap with or was not in
the vicinity of the reported QTLs and quantitative trait
nucleotides (QTNs) (Fig. 2; Additional files 8 and 11). This
suggested that this is a novel locus for palmitic acid.
We identified 21 enzyme-encoding genes that might
be involved in lipid metabolism within stable QTL re-
gions (Additional file 9). These genes included two
pyruvate kinase genes (GmPK, Glyma.10 g065000 and
Glyma.13 g149800), two diacylglycerol acyltransferase
genes
(GmDGAT,
Glyma.13 g106100
and
Glyma.13

genes (GmPDAT, Glyma.13 g108100, Glyma.16 g005800,
and Glyma.11 g190400), two 3-ketoacyl-ACP-synthase I
genes (GmFabB, Glyma.13 g128000 and Glyma.05 g218600),
a 3-ketoacyl-ACP-synthase II gene (GmFabF, Glyma.13
g112700), two 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase genes (GmKCS,
Glyma.15 g042500 and Glyma.15 g046300), a 3-hydroxyacyl-
ACP dehydrase gene (GmFabZ, Glyma.15 g052500), two
acyl carrier protein genes (GmACP, Glyma.16 g011300
and Glyma.05 g201300), a malonyl-CoA:ACP malonyl-
transferase gene (GmFabD,
Glyma.11 g164500), an
omega-3-fatty
acid
desaturase

gene
(GmFAD3,
Glyma.11 g174100), an acetyl-CoA carboxylase gene
(GmACCase, Glyma.05 g221100), an acyl-CoA syn-
thase gene (GmACS, Glyma.11 g194500), a pyruvate
dehydrogenase
gene
(GmPDH,
Glyma.14 g186900),
and
a
lysophosphatidic
acid

gene
(GmLPAAT,
Glyma.15 g034100).
In
addition,
nine
transcription factor genes involved in lipid metabolism
were also identified (Additional file 10), including a
helix-loop-helix gene (GmHLH, Glyma.05 g200900), a
WRKY protein gene (GmWRKY, Glyma.05 g203900), a
C3H protein gene (GmC3H, Glyma.05 g224400), two

genes
(GmMYB,

(GmDBB,

Co-localization of the QTLs for different traits was also
observed on Chr. Eleven and Fifteen (Additional file 7).
The QTLs qOA11_1 and qLA11_1 were co-located on
Chr. Eleven within the physical interval of 11.0–25.6 Mb.
The QTLs qOC15_1, qPA15_1, qOA15_1, and qLNA15_2
were co-located on Chr. Fifteen within the physical inter-
val of 2.80–5.63 Mb.
Discussion
In the present study, we identified 24 stable QTLs for seed
oil and composition. By comparing their mapped regions
with previous reports on the soybean reference genome
(Fig. 2; Additional files 8 and 11), we discovered that
qPA10_1 did not overlap with or was not adjacent to any
of the previously reported QTLs. Furthermore, it did not
contain QTNs associated with palmitic acid obtained by
GWAS. Due to a higher density genetic map constructed
with 11,398 SNP markers, the intervals of the QTL re-
gions were significantly reduced in comparison with those
previously reported. For example, for oil content, the
physical distance of qOC8_1, qOC8_2, qOC15_2, and
qOC20_2 in our study was 7.52–9.44 Mb, 9.44–10.8 Mb,
4.15–5.63 Mb, and 32.5–33.8 Mb, respectively. In com-
parison, the intervals were 5.58–10.28 Mb for qOC8_1
[16], 5.58–10.3 Mb for qOC8_2 [16], 3.23–4.07 Mb for
qOC15_2 [17], and 27.0–34.3 Mb for qOC20_2 [54]. For
stearic acid, the physical distance of qSA14_1 and qSA14_
3 in our study was 32.2–37.5 Mb and 42.2–43.4 Mb, re-
spectively. In comparison, the interval was 16.3–45.9 Mb
[56]. For linoleic acid, the physical distance of qLA5_1 and
qLA5_2 in our study was 37.5–39.9 Mb and 38.5–40.7 Mb,
while the interval was 37.6–42.2 Mb [57].

In comparison with previously reported QTLs (http://
www.soybase.org) (Additional files 8 and 11), 23 out of
the 24 QTLs were close to or overlapped with previously
reported QTLs (Fig. 2). For example, the QTL qOC2_1
for oil content on Chr. 02 was located around 5.08–6.27
Mb, which was adjacent to a reported QTL (6.86–9.67
Mb) [50]. In addition, qOC8_1 on Chr. 08, qOC8_2 on
Chr. 08, qOC15_1 on Chr. 15, and qOC15_2 on Chr. 15
were located around 7.52–9.44 Mb, 9.44–10.8 Mb, 2.80–
5.63 Mb, and 4.15–5.63 Mb, which overlapped with the
reported 5.52–12.64 Mb [16, 51, 52], 5.52–14.21 Mb
[51–53], 3.23–4.07 Mb [17], and 4.52–5.21 Mb [25], re-
spectively. For palmitic acid, qPA13_1 (21.8–26.8 Mb)
on Chr. 13 and qPA16_1 (0.42–1.19 Mb) on Chr. 16
were close to the reported 26.41–29.08 Mb and 2.67–
5.06 Mb, respectively [55, 56]. For stearic acid, qSA14_1,
qSA14_2, and qSA14_3 on Chr. 14 were located around
32.2–37.5 Mb, 16.3–40.5 Mb, and 42.2–43.4 Mb, respect-
ively, which overlapped with the region of 16.30–45.90
Mb [56]. For linolenic acid, qLNA5_1 (33.8–35.4 Mb)
partially overlapped with 31.98–34.65 Mb [18]. Although
these QTLs are located in similar regions, whether their
responsible genes are identical requires further investiga-
tion. In contrast, qPA10_1 on Chr. 10 was mapped to
the region of 5.94–9.98 Mb, which was distal from the
reported 0.98–1.87 Mb [24] (Fig. 2; Additional file 8) and
did not contain any reported QTNs that were associated
with palmitic acid by GWAS [58] (Additional file 11).
This result indicated that this QTL is a novel locus for
palmitic acid.
By annotating all genes in 24 stable QTL intervals with
the Gene Annotation Tool of the SoyBase database [20],
12 important enzyme-encoding genes involved in lipid
metabolism were identified (Additional file 9). For ex-
ample,
GmACCase
(Glyma.05 g221100)
encoded
an
acetyl-CoA carboxylase that catalyzes the formation of
malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA as the direct substrate of
the de novo biosynthesis of fatty acids [59]. GmFabD
(Glyma.11 g164500) encoded a malonyl-CoA:ACP malo-
nyltransferase that is responsible for transferring the
malonyl group of malonyl-CoA to an acyl carrier protein
(ACP).
GmACP
(Glyma.05 g201300
and
Glyma.16
g011300) encoded an acyl carrier protein that transports
the growing fatty acid chain between the enzymatic do-
mains of fatty acid synthase [60]. GmFabB (Glyma.05
g218600 and Glyma.13 g128000) and GmFabF (Glyma.13
g112700) encoded a ketoacyl-ACP synthases I and II, re-
spectively, which are mainly used to produce palmitoyl-
ACP and stearoyl-ACP as the condensing enzyme of fatty
acid chain elongation, respectively. GmFabG (Glyma.08
g102100) and GmFabZ (Glyma.15 g052500) encoded a 3-
ketoacyl-ACP reductase and 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehy-
drase, which catalyze the reduction and dehydration reac-
tion of 3-ketoacyl-ACP, respectively [61]. In addition,
GmFAD3 (Glyma.11 g174100) encoded an omega-3 fatty
acid desaturase 3 that catalyzes a third double bond into
linoleic acid to produce linolenic acid [40, 62]. GmDGAT
(Glyma.13 g106100 and Glyma.13 g118300) encoded a di-
acylglycerol acyltransferase that catalyzes the formation of
TAGs from fatty acids and glycerol 3-phosphate [63, 64].
The presence of these genes within the stable QTL sug-
gests that these may contribute to soybean seed lipid me-
tabolism. However, whether these enzyme-encoded genes
are responsible for the corresponding QTLs requires con-
firmation using transgenic methods. In addition to the key
enzyme genes involved in lipid metabolism, some tran-
scription factor genes also have important roles in regulat-
ing fatty acid biosynthesis. We identified 11 transcription
factor genes involved in lipid metabolism within the
24 stable QTL intervals (Additional file 10), including
GmB3, GmC3H, GmDBB, GmHLH, GmMYB, GmNF-
YA, GmWRKY, and GmZIP. Several transcription fac-
tors involved in regulating oil and fatty acid biosyn-
thesis have been studied in soybean. For example, the
overexpression of GmNFYA in Arabidopsis signifi-
cantly increases seed oil content [46]. GmMYB73 pro-
motes lipid accumulation in transgenic Arabidopsis,
possibly through the suppression of GLABRA2, a
transcription factor of HD-ZIP [49]. The roles of
transcription factors in our QTL regions in the do-
mestication of the seed oil trait in soybean should be
further studied.
In the interval of the novel QTL qPA10_1, three candi-
date genes potentially involved in lipid metabolism were
also identified, including GmPK (Glyma.10 g065000),
GmB3
(Glyma.10 g076100),
and
GmZIP
(Glyma.10
g071700). GmPK (Glyma.10 g065000) encodes a pyruvate
kinase (PK). During soybean seed development, phos-
phoenolpyruvate carboxylase and pyruvate kinase activ-
ities contribute to a complex interaction that regulates
the metabolic flow of glycolytic carbon into precursors
for both protein and oil biosynthesis [65]. In Arabidopsis
thaliana seeds, reducing the plastidic pyruvate kinase ac-
tivity by disruption of the gene encoding the β1 subunit
of pyruvate kinase resulted in a 60% reduction of seed
oil content [66]. GmB3 (Glyma.10 g076100) encodes a
B3 domain family of transcription factor. In Brassica
napus, the BnFUSCA3 (BnFUS3) mutant, a member of
B3 domain transcription factors, repressed seed oil levels
and increased levels of linoleic acid, possibly due to the
reduced expression of ω-3 FADESATURASE (FAD3)
[67]. In soybean, GmLEC2a, a B3 domain transcription
factor, complemented the defects of the Arabidopsis
atlec2 mutant in seedling development and triacylglyc-
erol accumulation. The overexpression of GmLEC2a in
Arabidopsis seeds increased triacylglycerol content by
34% and the composition of long chain fatty acids by 4%
relative to the control seeds [68]. GmZIP (Glyma.10
Yao et al. BMC Plant Biology           (2020) 20:51 
Page 8 of 13
g071700) encodes a homeobox-leucine zipper protein.
Song et al. (2013) reported that GmbZIP123 (Glyma.06
g010200) enhances lipid content in transgenic Arabidop-
sis seeds by promoting expression of sucrose transporter
genes (SUC1 and SUC5) and cell wall invertase genes
(cwINV1, cwINV3, and cwINV6) [48]. In A. thaliana,
bZIP67 binds to G-boxes in the FATTY ACID DESA-
TURASE3 (FAD3) promoter, enhances FAD3 expression,
and increases linolenic acid seed content [69].
Conclusions
By means of SLAF-seq technology, we constructed a
high-density
genetic
map
comprising
11,398
SNP
markers and identified 24 stable QTLs for soybean seed
oil content and fatty acid composition using a 181 RIL
population derived from a wild soybean and a cultivated
soybean. Among these QTLS, one QTL qPA10_1 did
not overlap with or was not close to previously reported
QTLs and also did not contain any QTNs associated
with palmitic acid, indicating that it is a novel locus.
Some interesting genes in the QTL regions were also
identified and are worthy of further investigation. Our
study provides a valuable information that may contrib-
ute to the elucidation of oil biosynthesis in soybean.
Methods
Plant materials
The RIL mapping population comprised 181 F7 progen-
ies derived from a cross between the wild soybean
ZYD00463 (Glycine soja) and the cultivated soybean
WDD01514 (Glycine max). The parents of ZYD00463
(Glycine soja) and WDD01514 (Glycine max) were pro-
vided by the Oil Crops Research Institute of the Chinese
Academy of Agricultural Sciences (Wuhan, China). All
181 RILs and their parents were planted at two experi-
mental stations in Hubei Province, Wuhan (N30°35′,
E114°33′) and Henan
Province,
Xuchang (N34°02′,
E113°81′) in 2015 and 2016. The two sites possess dif-
ferent climatic conditions, with Wuhan experiencing
higher temperatures and more rain and Xuchang experi-
encing lower temperatures and less rain. Three replicates
of the parents and progenies were planted following a
randomized complete block design. Each plot comprised
a 2.5-m row with 1.0-m spacing between rows and 0.5-
m spacing between adjacent plants. For each genotype,
seeds were harvested from five plants from each plot at
the R8 growth stage (full-maturity stage) [70]. The soy-
bean seeds were air-dried until a constant weight, then
the traits were assessed as described below.
Oil and fatty acid determination
The seed oil content and fatty acid composition were de-
termined according to Wei et al. [71] with minor modifi-
cations. Briefly, 30 soybean seeds from each line were
ground to a fine powder. Twenty milligrams of each pow-
dered sample were transferred to a 10-mL glass tube. Sul-
furic acid-methanol (5%, 2 mL), butylated hydroxytoluene
(BHT) (0.2%, 25 μL), methylbenzene (300 μL), and internal
standard (IS) (methyl heptadecanoate, Sigma Aldrich, St.
Louis, USA, 2.5–5 mg/mL, 100 μL) were added to the
samples for fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) preparation,
and the sample was esterified in a water bath at 90–95 °C
for 1.5 h. After cooling to room temperature, sodium
chloride (0.9%, 1 mL) and n-hexane (1 mL) were added to
the extracts. The supernatant was obtained for gas chro-
matography (GC) analysis.
The esters were separated by a GC (Agilent 6890 N,
USA) fitted with a capillary column (FFAP, 30 m,
0.25 mm i.d., 0.50-μm film thickness). Nitrogen was
used as the carrier gas at an inlet pressure of 25 psi.
The temperatures of the injection port and detector
(FID) were maintained at 250 °C and 260 °C, respect-
ively, and the temperature program for the column
was as follows: 210 °C (1 min), increasing to 230 °C at
10 °C/min (22 min). The computer software used for
statistical analysis was STATISTICA version 6.0 (Stat-
soft Inc., Oklahoma, USA). The peaks were identified
based on their retention times using authentic stan-
dards of fatty acid methyl esters. The relative peak
area was used for quantification of the contents of
the fatty acids. The formula for calculating seed oil
content was as follows:
Oil content %
ð
Þ ¼
At=As
ð
Þ  ms
½
=mi;
where At and As are the total peak area and the internal
standard peak area identified based on their retention
times, respectively; and ms and mi are the weights of the
internal standard and dry seed. The samples of each line
were determined thrice.
Statistical analysis
All the phenotypic data were analyzed using PROC
MIXED program in SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary,
NC, USA). Pearson’s correlation coefficients among all
traits were calculated from lines in single environments
using the PROC CORR function in SAS 9.3.
The heritability in a single environment was estimated
as follows:
h2 ¼ δ2
g= δ2
g þ δ2
e=r


:
The heritability across environments was calculated as
follows:
h2 ¼
δ2

g þ δ2
gy=n þ δ2
e=nr ;
where

g

traits per plot among the RILs, δ2
e is the error vari-
ance, r is the number of replications for the trait, and
n is the number of environments [72, 73]. ANOVA
was conducted across environments to determine the
significance of genotype, environment, and their inter-
actions. The error components of variance ( δ2
e ),
genotype × environment interaction (δ2
gy ), and geno-
type ( δ2
g ) were analyzed using the general linear
model procedure (PROC GLM) in SAS 9.3 (SAS In-
stitute Inc.). All parameters were estimated from the
expected mean squares in the ANOVA.
Genetic map construction
The SLAF-seq method was applied to develop SNP
markers between the two parents [74]. The SNP
markers were used to construct the high-density gen-
etic linkage map using the Kosambi mapping function
of the JoinMap version 4.0 software [75]. The SNP
markers were grouped based on a LOD score of 3.0
and then ordered by the input algorithm to estimate
the
recombination
frequencies.
Recombination
fre-
quencies between linked loci were transformed into
distances (cM) [76]. The collinearity of the LGs with
the
soybean
reference
genome
was
analyzed
by
aligning the sequence of each SNP marker with the
genome sequences of Williams 82 [77].
QTL mapping and candidate gene prediction
Composite interval mapping (CIM) incorporated into
WinQTL cartographer version 2.5 was used to detect
additive QTLs [78]. For each trait, the threshold for
the identification of a significant QTL with a LOD >
3.6 was estimated by permutation tests with 1000 rep-
etitions at P < 0.05. Cofactors were taken into account,
and a window size of 10 cM around the test interval
was selected for CIM analysis. The distribution of the
QTLs on the genetic linkage map was mapped using
MapChart version 2.2 [79]. The detected QTLs were
denoted by combining a letter or letters representing
the abbreviation of traits with a chromosome number
[80]. The QTLs that were repeatedly detected in at
least two environments, Wuhan and Xuchang across 2
years, were defined as stable QTLs in this study. The
QTLs that were previously reported by other groups
were defined as reported QTLs. The predicted genes
within the stable QTL intervals were obtained from
the SoyBase database according to the annotation of
the soybean reference genome (Wm82.a2.v1.1). Gene
Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the predicted
genes was performed using the GO website with
default settings [81].
