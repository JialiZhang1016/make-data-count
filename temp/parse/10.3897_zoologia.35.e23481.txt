ABSTRACT. Spiders, as predators of insects and other invertebrates, are an important part of the natural enemies, and they are 
recognized as an important biological control agent. Plutella xylostella (Linnaeus, 1758), the diamondback moth (DBM), is a 
well-known and destructive insect pest of brassicaceous crops worldwide. Here, we analyzed the functional responses of four 
spiders (Araneae) – Ebrechtella tricuspidata (Fabricius, 1775) (Thomisidae), Pardosa laura (Karsch, 1879) (Lycosidae), Pardosa 
astrigera (Koch, 1878) (Lycosidae), and Pardosa pseudoannulata (Bösenberg & Strand, 1906) (Lycosidae) – on P. xylostella 
larvae. We also analyzed intraspecific disturbances in the predation reaction and the intensity of scrambling competition of 
the spiders to P. xylostella larvae. Our results demonstrated that the functional responses of four spiders of different genera 
were in line with the Holling II model. Two Lycosidae spiders (P. astrigera and P. pseudoannulata) had the potential to control 
P. xylostella, and female and male spiders that belonged to the same species had different functional responses to P. xylostella. 
The functional responses of female predation of P. astrigena, P. laura, and P. pseudoannulata was stronger than the males, but 
male E. tricuspidatus had stronger functional responses to predation than females. We used the Hassell model to describe 
the intraspecific disturbance experiments of four spiders. There were intraspecific disturbances in the predation reactions of 
spiders, indicating that the predation ratio of spiders decreased in relation to the increase of its density, and with the increase 
of spider density, the intensity of scrambling competition of the spider increased.

INTRODUCTION
Plutella xylostella (Linnaeus, 1758) is a well-known and 
destructive insect pest of brassicaceous crops worldwide (Talekar 
and Shelton 1993). The annual cost around the world for P. 
xylostella pest control measures has been routinely quoted at 
US$ 1 billion from 1993 to 2012 (Zalucki et al. 2012). Plutella 
xylostella is very difficult to control for several reasons, including 
diversity and abundance of host plants, the lack or disruption 
of its natural enemies, high reproductive potential (over 20 
generations per year in the tropics), and its genetic elasticity, 
which facilitates rapid development of resistance to insecticides 
(Sarfraz et al. 2006).
In the locations where brassicaceous crops are planted, 
large amounts of pesticides have been used to control pest. Under 
such high selection pressures, pests often develop high levels of 
insecticide resistance (Shelton et al. 1993). Unfortunately, the 
most prominent one is P. xylostella, which is naturally difficult 
to control (Mota-Sanchez et al. 2002, Sarfraz and Keddie 2005). 
Zhao et al. (2002) reported that most populations of P. xylostella 
are susceptible to an insecticide called Spinosad, but control fail­
ures occurred in several locations of Hawaii. Sarfraz and Keddie 
(2005) reported significant resistance to almost every synthetic 
insecticide applied in the field of many crucifer-producing re­
gions. For these reasons, we urgently need more environmentally 
friendly methods, such as biological methods, to control pests 
and to alleviate the current situation (Shelton et al. 1993).
Spiders are an important part of the natural enemies, 
and they are recognized as an important biological control 
agent (Matteson 2000, Turnbull 1973). Rodrigues et al. (2013) 
thought a balance could be reached between the number of spi­
ders and pests that was equivalent to a natural-control process.

For example, Nyffeler et al. (1987) reported that the Lycosidae 
spiders can be predators of the pests as Heliothis zea (Boddie, 
1850) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and Alabama argillacea (Hübner, 
1823) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in cotton fields. In addition, 
Pérez-Guerrero et al. (2014) confirmed the considerable potential 
and value of some cursorial spiders in the biological control of 
lepidopteran cotton pests.
In the present study, we researched three Lycosidae spiders 
and one Thomisidae spider that have been used for the biological 
control of some key lepidopteran pests (Senior et al. 2016). In 
an effort to study these biological control agents, we defined 
several objectives. First, we compared the differences between 
the functional responses of the four species of spiders, and we in­
vestigated the effect of spider gender on the functional responses 
toward P. xylostella larvae. Second, we analyzed intraspecific 
disturbances and the intensity of scrambling competition of 
these four spiders species. Finally, we systematically evaluated 
the predation of the four species of spiders toward P. xylostella.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Plutella xylostella and spiders rearing procedure
Ebrechtella tricuspidata (Fabricius, 1775) (Thomisidae), 
Pardosa laura (Karsch, 1879) (Lycosidae), Pardosa astrigera (Koch, 
1878) (Lycosidae), and Pardosa pseudoannulata (Bösenberg & 
Strand, 1906) (Lycosidae) were chosen for this study because 
they are preponderant species that are common and abundant 
in tea gardens (Cui et al. 2012). The spiders were collected 
from the fields of Huazhong Agricultural University in Wuhan 
(30°52’N; 114°31’E), Hubei Province, China, between May and 
October 2015. They were kept individually in cylindrical glass 
tube (2.5 cm diameter × 10.0 cm high) with a layer of sponge 
(1.5–2.0 cm thick) moistened with water on the bottom. The 
tubes were plugged with cotton. The spiders were kept in the 
chambers under the following laboratory conditions: 26 ± 0.5 °C, 
relative humidity of 60% ± 3%, and under a light: dark cycle 
of 14 h:10 h (lights turned on at 8:00 am). Every two days, the 
spiders were fed adult Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen, 1830) 
(Diptera: Drosophilidae).
Plutella xylostella were obtained from the Vegetable Re­
search Institution of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, where 
they were placed together in a cage and fed with cabbage. They 
were kept under the same laboratory conditions as the spiders 
and their cages were cleaned every five to six days.
Functional response of spiders to third instar larvae of P. xylostella
At the beginning of the experiment, the spiders were 
starved for 48 hours to eliminate different degrees of hunger. 
Three days after the last molt, one adult spider of each species 
was placed in separate containers. Each container contained one 
spider and third instar larvae of P. xylostella at different densities 
(10, 15, 20, 25, and 30); there were also control containers that 
contained no P. xylostella. The experiments were repeated with at 
least three replicates per density level. The number of prey that 
survived after 24 hours was recorded. The functional responses 
of each gender of spider in each family were analyzed according 
to Holling II model (Holling 1959).
Intraspecific disturbance of the predation reaction and intensity of 
scrambling competition of the spiders toward P. xylostella larvae
Three days after the last molt, adult spiders (n = 15) from 
each species were placed into six groups with 30 third instar 
larvae of P. xylostella in each group: control group (no spiders), 
and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 spiders per container. Spiders were starved 
for 48 hours before the tests to standardize the hunger level. 
Each density experiment was repeated at least three times. The 
number of surviving P. xylostella in each container after 24 hours 
was recorded. The intraspecific disturbance of the spiders pre­
dation reaction on P. xylostella larvae were calculated according 
to the Hassell model (Hassell and Varley 1969).
Data analyses
All functional-response equations were fitted using a 
Holling II model, as shown in the following equation:
Where, Na was the number of the third instar larvae of P. 
xylostella predated by the spider, N was the density of the third 
instar larvae of P. xylostella, a’ was the attack coefficient of the 
spider, and Th was the handling time of the spider per one P. 
xylostella. T was equal to one because the functional response 
experiment lasted for one day. Equation (1) is a nonlinear-curve 
equation, so we took the inverse of the equation to produce a 
linear equation:
Na and N were recorded based on the experimental result; 
a’ and Th were calculated using Equation (2).
All experimental data of intraspecific disturbance of the 
predation reaction of spiders on P. xylostella larvae were fitted 
using the Hassell model:
Where, E was the predation ratio of the spider, P was the 
spider density, Q was the searching constant, and m was the 
interference constant. Q and m were the parameters that were 
estimated according to the equation:

Here, Na was the total number of P. xylostella preyed on 
by all of the spiders, N was the P. xylostella density, and P was 
the spider density.
The predation competition of spiders on P. xylostella 
was equal to the scrambling competition, so the intensity of 
scrambling competition (I) of spiders was determined using by 
the following equation:
Where, E1 was the predation ratio of one spider and Ep was 
the predation ration with P density of spiders.
The relationship between the intensity of scrambling 
competition (I) and the density of spiders (P) was analyzed using 
the following equation:
 
a and b were the parameters that were estimated according 
to the values of I.
All collected data were analyzed using MS Excel 2007.
RESULTS
Functional response of spiders to P. xylostella
The functional-response equations of each gender for the 
four spiders species are shown in Table 1.The fitting coefficients 
of the eight equations ranged from 0.9031 to 0.9672, indicating 
these eight equations fit well. Compared to E. tricuspidata and P. 
laura, P. astrigena and P. pseudoannulata had stronger predation 
reactions toward the third instar larvae of P. xylostella. Among the 
four types of spiders, P. pseudoannulata was the greatest natural 
enemy to P. xylostella, and P. laura was the weakest predator.
The functional-response equations of female and male P. 
pseudoannulata to the third instar larvae of P. xylostella were 1/Na 
= 0.8913/Nt + 0.0382 and 1/Na = 0.9736/Nt + 0.0411, respectively. 
The maximum number of third instar larvae of P. xylostella pre­
dated by both genders of P. pseudoannulata (26.2 larvae of female 
and 24.3 larvae of male) were significantly higher than those 
predated by any gender of the other three spiders. At the same 
time, the highest a’ (that is, 1.1219 h-1) and the shortest Th (that 
is, 0.382 h) were reached by female P. pseudoannulata (Table 1).
At the same time, the results showed that female and 
male spiders that belonged to the same species had different 
functional responses to P. xylostella. Three of the four types of 
female spiders (P. laura, P. astrigena, and P. pseudoannulata) had 
stronger functional responses than the males of the same spe­
cies. The functional-response equation of female and male E. 
tricuspidata in response to the third instar larvae of P. xylostella 
were 1/Na = 1.2555/Nt + 0.0801 and 1/Na = 1.8392/Nt + 0.0652, 
respectively. The maximum number (Nmax) of third instar larvae 
of P. xylostella predated by male E. tricuspidata was 15.3, which 
was significantly higher than the female (12.5). The a’ of the 
male E. tricuspidata (0.7965/h) was also higher than the female 
(0.5437/h) (Table 1).
Intraspecific disturbance and intensity of scrambling competition 
of the spider predation on P. xylostella larvae
According to Na (Table 2) and Equation (4), we calculated 
the values of Ep shown in Table 2. With the increase of spider 
density, Na and Ep of each spider decreased gradually. The search­
ing constant, Q, and the interference constant, m, of the Hassell 
model were calculated according to Ep and the spider density, as 
shown in Table 3. The fitting coefficients of the four equations 
ranged from 0.9424 to 0.9863, indicating that the Hassell model 
can be used to describe the intraspecific disturbance situation of 
the spider. There were intraspecific disturbances in the predation 
reaction of spiders.
Using the Equation (5), we calculated the value for I, as 
shown in Table 2. At the same time, we calculated the values 
of a and b parameters of Equation (6), as shown in Table 4. The 
relationship between the intensity of scrambling competition, 
I, and spider density, P, was positively correlated, indicating that 
the intensity of the scrambling competition increased with the 
increasing spider density.
DISCUSSION
Plutella xylostella is one of the major pests of Chinese 
cruciferous plants, and they have caused a great deal of 
harm to Chinese vegetable crops for many years (Lin et al. 
2006). Currently, under high pesticide selection pressures, P. 
xylostella have developed high levels of insecticide resistance 
in some areas. This means that simple chemical methods are 
not sufficient or efficient. New biological control strategies

are increasingly needed to control insect pests (Saleh et al. 
2017); however, the role of natural predators of P. xylostella in 
agricultural ecosystems has not been taken seriously. Research 
and practice of biological control have concentrated mainly on 
parasitoids and diseases on this insect pest (Talekar and Shelton 
1993). The spiders are the most abundant predators recorded 
in grain crops, and their assemblages cause high mortality on 
pest populations (Riechert 1999, Whitehouse and Lawrence 
2001, Pearce and Zalucki 2005). Therefore, the present article 
has focused on four common and abundant spiders in order 
to explore the potential to control the diamondback moth. 
Understanding the relationship between the spider predator 
and prey has been a central goal in controlling the worldwide 
pest P. xylostella. Since 1959, Holling’s prey-dependent Type 
II functional response, a model that is a function of prey 
abundance, has served as the basis for a robust literature on 
predator-prey theory (Skalski and Gilliam 2001).
Similar to other studies that have modelled the functional 
response of spiders using the Holling II model, the present study 
found that with an increase in the P. xylostella density, the feeding 
amount of the spider first increased, but then reached a stable 
level. Lin et al. (2006) found that the predator function of the 
Hylyphantes graminicola (Sundevall, 1830) (Araneae: Linyphiidae) 
on the P. xylostella larvae belongs to the Holling II model, and H. 
graminicola had predation preferences for the larvae of P. xylostella. 
Zeng et al. (2016) found that the functional predation response 
of P. pseudoannulata and Pardosa procurva (Yu & Song, 1988) 
(Araneae: Lycosidae) on the fourth instar larvae of P. xylostella 
fit well with the Holling II model, and the Holling Ⅲ model could 
perfect the predation effect. The functional-response curves for 
these spiders seem to be a typical type-II functional response, with 
the prey consumed increasing to a plateau as the aphid density 
increases (Mansour and Heimbach 1993). A possible explanation 
is that the stomach capacity of the spider is limited. When the 
predation needs are met, it no longer needs prey.
More spider species were used for the experiments of the 
present study in comparison to other research reports, which 
have been mainly focused on the effects of temperature and space 
volumes in relation to the functional response of the predator. 
Duan and Zhang (2004) reported that the predation of Menochi­
lus sexmaculata (Fabricius, 1781) (Coleoptere: Coccinellidae) on 
Macrosiphoniella sanborni (Gillette, 1908) (Homotera: Aphididae) 
was affected by temperature, vessel space, and prey density.
In the present study, we concentrated on the effect of 
spider gender on the functional response of the spider toward P. 
xylostella because there is little research on this topic. Previous 
studies reported that female spiders are more ferocious, and their 
predation amounts are larger, such that females consumed more 
than males under similar conditions (Walker and Rypstra 2001, 
Mohsin et al. 2015). This is presumed to be due to the female 
requiring more energy to lay eggs, care for brood, and reproduce 
and hibernate in upcoming seasons. Mukhtar et al. (2012) report­
ed female have to fulfill their energy requirements to maximize 
their breeding. In addition, Walker and Rypstra (2001) found that 
Rabidosa rabida (Walckenaer, 1837) (Araneae: Lycosidae) females 
attack more prey than males. However, in the present study, in 
contrast with past research, the maximum number of P. xylostella 
larvae predated and the attack coefficient of male E. tricuspidata

were significantly higher than female E. tricuspidata. On the other 
hand, among the four spiders species, P. pseudoannulata was the 
greatest natural enemy to P. xylostella. One possibility for this 
finding is that P. pseudoanmuata has the largest body size. It needs 
more prey to meet its own energy demands.
There were intraspecific disturbance in the predation reac­
tion of the four types of spiders. When five spiders were placed 
in one reaction container, we observed that they did not attack 
each other. However, they took more time to search for the prey, 
the interference between individual spiders increased, and the 
preying capacity of each spider decreased. The correlation between 
intensity of scrambling competition, I, and spider density, P, was 
positive. Wu and Wang (1987) also found that the predation of 
P. pseudoannulata increased with the increase in the number of 
prey, and decreased with the increase of its density. Predatory 
arthropods can reduce the impact of these invertebrates and limit 
the number of pests in agroecosystems. Predators displayed lower 
predation rates when kept together compared to the predation 
rates of individual spiders kept alone (Pérez-Guerrero et al. 2013).
According to the results of the present study, we found that 
two species of Lycosidae spiders – P. astrigera and P. pseudoannu­
lata – had the potential to control P. xylostella. We also found 
that male E. tricuspidata were more suitable to be released in the 
planted brassicaceous fields. However, the functional response 
and intraspecific disturbance experiments were only carried out 
under laboratory conditions in which predator and prey were 
placed in a small container. It is difficult to extrapolate to an 
actual situation in the field, where the size of the activity space, 
the niche overlap index, the developmental period, the arthro­
pod community, and the density of predator and prey can all 
affect the predator behavior. In order to fully evaluate the role of 
spiders as predators for the control of P. xylostella, future studies 
could include longer experiments for agroecosystems, and could 
use varied methods so as to cover the most appropriate release 
number of spiders for the control of P. xylostella.
The results showed that the functional responses of four 
spiders species were in line with the Holling II model. Two 
Lycosidae spider – P. astrigera and P. pseudoannulata – had the 
potential to control P. xylostella. The functional response of the 
female P. astrigena, P. laura, and P. pseudoannulata were stronger 
than the males; the opposite results were found for E. tricuspi­
data. Intraspecific interference of the four spiders were analyzed 
using the Hassell model. We found that the predation ratio of 
the spider decreased with the increase of predator density. At the 
same time, the correlation between the intensity of scrambling 
competition and spider density was positive, indicating that 
the intensity of the scrambling competition increased with an 
increase in spider density.
