Abstract 
Soil management has great potential to affect soil respiration. In this 
study, we investigated the effects of organic versus conventional soil 
management on soil respiration.  We measured the main soil physical-
chemical properties from conventional and organic managed soil in 
Ecuador. Soil respiration was determined using alkaline absorption 
according to Witkamp.  Soil properties such as organic matter, 
nitrogen, and humidity, were comparable between conventional and 
organic soils in the present study, and in a further analysis there was 
no statically significant correlation with soil respiration. Therefore, 
even though organic farmers tend to apply more organic material to 
their fields, but this did not result in a significantly higher CO2 
production in their soils in the present study.

Introduction
Research related to the benefits of organic management1 has 
become increasingly important in sustainable agriculture. Organic 
soil management can contribute to meaningful socio-economic 
and ecologically sustainable development. Kilcher states that 
“Organic agriculture reduces the risk of yield failure, stabilizes 
returns and improves the quality of life of small farmers’ families”2. 
Soil management has great potential to affect soil respiration, 
which is an important qualitative indicator of soil microbial 
activity3. Soil respiration is released as a result of soil organic 
matter decomposition. The present study aims to investigate the 
effects of organic versus conventional management on CO2 pro-
duction of some Northern Ecuadorian agricultural soils. Our 
hypothesis was that major soil respiration will be observed in 
soils under organic management due to the increased amount of 
applied organic materials.
Methods
Sampling sites
Soil samples from 23 organic farms and conventionally man-
aged neighbouring farms were analyzed. In total, 17 sampling 
sites were located in organic farms, while 6 sampling sites were 
located in chemical fertilizer-treated areas. The sampling sites 
were chosen according to proximity of organic and convention-
ally managed farms in which the same crops are produced. Further 
details about each of the sampling sites can be found in Table 1. 
Approximately 1000 g of soil samples of 0–20 cm depth were 
taken. The following crops were produced in the examined 
areas: broccoli, potato, tomato and carrot.
Soil properties
Soil moisture content was determined gravimetrically, drying the 
soil at 105°C for 24 hours according to Fernández et al. (2008)4. 
Soil texture was measured using sodium hexametaphosphate 
((NaPO3)6) according to Bouyoucos (1962)5. To measure the soil 
chemical properties, the samples were sieved through a 2mm 
mesh and pre-incubated at 25° for 72 hours. Soil pH in dis-
tilled water (soil/water, 1/2.5, w/w) was determined according to 
Karkanis (1991)6. In addition, we measured the electrical conduc-
tivity (EC) using a glass electrode according to Karkanis (1991)6. 
Cylinder volume was determined according to Agostini et al. 
(2014)7. Soil organic matter was determined according to 
Walkley and Black (1934)8. We measured the phosphorous con-
tent according to Olsen (1954)9. The Sand/Silt/Clay ratio was 
determined by Bouyoucos’s method (1936)10, while the cation 
exchange capacity was determined according to ISO 11260 
(1994)11 protocol.
Soil respiration
The experiment was applied at 25°C. 0, 1M NaOH (10ml) was 
placed in laboratory bottles (250ml), a sterile gauze pad were 
filled with 10 g of soil sample according to Witkamp (1966)12. After 
10 days, the amount of CO2 was subsequently measured by stand-
ardized titration against 0.1N HCl using firstly phenolphthalein 
and then methyl orange indicator according to Witkamp (1966)12.
The below formula was applied to calculate soil respiration:
m(CO2) = VxNx22 CO2
And CO2 production (for 10 days):
mg(CO2) * 100g – 1 * 10 day – 1 = 
methyl orange factor * HCI – phenolphthaleinloss) *  
NAOH factor * 2, 2 * Moisture multiplication factor
where

We determined the volume of the examined soils (counting with 
0 – 20 cm depth) using topsoil calculator tool (https://www. 
tillersturf.co.uk/topsoil-calculator). The results of soil respiration 
was then estimated in kg(CO2)/ha/day.
Statistical analysis
To evaluate the behavior within results, two types of test were 
performed: i) Student’s t-test for comparing means between 
conventional and organic crop systems in terms of soil respi-
ration (kg/CO2/ha/day), organic matter (%) and nitrogen (%). 
Furthermore, Person’s and Spearman’s correlation were fixed 
in order to test data covariation and correlation. ii) ANOVA was 
used to compare conventional and organic crop system and the 
type of crop harvested in the sampling site.
Results
The results of soil respiration from areas of organic and conven-
tional soil management are comparable (Dataset 1).
For soil respiration, conventional soil mean was 88.50 and 
organic mean was 98.64, showing and increment around 10%. 
However, there were no statistically significant differences between 
group means as determined by one-way ANOVA (p =0.15), com-
paring conventional and organic systems. Pearson‘s and Kendell‘s 
tests have showed no correlation. Soil respiration correlation coef-
ficient with organic matter was lower than 0.05 and with nitrogen 
content was lower than 0.12. This analysis did not consider the 
differences between conventional and organic systems (Figure 1).
There were statistically significant differences between group 
means as determined by one-way ANOVA (p < 0.05), compar-
ing crop types. Furthermore, a post hoc test (Duncan) was fixed. 
There was only one crop (carrot) in conventional system (odds 
lower than 0.05) that differs drastically from the others, as 
pointed out in (Figure 2).
Considering soil characteristics (pH, CIC, K, and Electric con-
ductivity), Student’s t-test was applied to identify differences 
between conventional and organic systems. Only the characteristics

from carrot crop systems (conventional or organic) have shown 
differences in terms of means (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the mean 
of conventional crop system was lower in every characteristic 
evaluated. Besides, these results were in congruence with 
Figure 2, leading us to believe that the cropping system has no 
influence on soil respiration, which is in contrast to the influence 
that soil characteristics have over soil respiration in this study.

conventional and organic managed soils
http://dx.doi.org/10.5256/f1000research.13852.d195529
Parameters as follows: pH, Organic material (percentage), Total 
Nitrogen (percentage), Match (mg/kg), Potassium (cmol/kg), 
Electrical conductivity (dS/m), CIC (cmol/kg), Soil moisture content 
(percentage), Sand (percentage), Silt-limo (percentage), Clay 
(percentage), Texture (class), Soil respiration (kg/CO2/ha/day). 
Conclusions
Organic farmers tend to apply more organic material to their fields, 
but this did not result in a significantly higher CO2 production 
in their soils. The difference between organic and conventional 
soils (10% in mean) is not enough to conclude that the soil res-
piration under these two systems was different, considering the 
analysis of their variance.
Soil properties like organic matter, nitrogen, and humidity, 
were comparable between conventional and organic soils in the 
present study, and in a further analysis there was no statically 
significant correlation with soil respiration. However, biologi-
cal significance should be investigated in a posteriori research 
including microbial community profile of the soil and specific 
interactions in highlands (over 2500 m.a.s.l.).
Ethics
Oral consent was obtained from the farmers for the collection of 
soil samples from their land. Their only request was to inform 
them about the results of the soil characteristics, that we have 
already done personally on 9 November, 2017.

The submitted manuscript by Bence et al. is good work which is suitable for publication in F1000 
research. Authors have compared the organic practices and conventional practices, and compared 
their effects on soil respiration which is very important aspect. Standard methodologies were 
followed which ensures reproducibility of the results. The findings were subjected to the statistical 
analysis and conclusion drawn nicely. 
 
However, I have below suggestions for improvement which may be considered as minor revisions:
"Physical-chemical" could be replaced by "Physico-chemical" throughout the manuscript.
○
In abstract, word "statically" should be replaced by "statistically"
○
In result, "showing and increment around 10%." should be "showing an increment around 
10%."
○
The discussion could be added more so that the findings of the study will become stronger.

This article worked at the differences between organic and conventional soil management. This 
research examined an important and topical issue especially the soil respiration under changing 
plant and soil conditions. 
  
Introduction and methods 
The research investigated 23 soil samples in Ecuador. The samples were located from organic (17 
samples) and conventionally managed neighboring farms (6 samples). In the research trials 
broccoli, potato, tomato and carrot were applied as test plant. Soil properties were measured after 
1000 g soil samples of 0-20 cm depths of soil were taken in every picked area. The soil moisture, 
texture, pH, electrical conductivity, cylinder volume, organic matter, phosphorus content, 
sand/silt/clay ratio and cation exchange capacity, and the soil respiration were analyzed in 
laboratory. 
The values of the soil parameters are presented in a dataset, which inform about the important 
soil parameters especially the calculated soil respiration in kg (CO2)/ha/day). The protocols 
(description of the tests) are clear and traceable, especially the formula to calculate soil 
respiration. 
The study describes the applied type of fertilizers especially the concentration of NPK fertilizers. 
  
Comment on the Methods 
- The sampling time and vegetation status are important for the evaluation, this information is 
missing in the study. If it’s possible, describe the followings: When the soil sampling happened? 
What was the state of the vegetation of test plants? 
- A bit more detail of the soil properties inform us about the actual soil status. The studied soils are 
classified as sandy textured soil, according to the soil classification (Franco Arenoso). The most 
typical parameters of the samples are the following: high sandy texture, neutral pH, good/very 
good organic matter-nitrogen and phosphorus content, 10-20% moisture content. I suggest 
describing it in the Methods. 
  
Results 
The results of the study are described with sufficient statistical analysis. It also describes the 
statistically significant/not significant results. There were solely statistically significant differences 
between crop types (for soil respiration by one-way ANOVA correlation test). 
- The Figure 1 contains a typographical error (Orgacin matter instead of Organic matter). 
- It may be more informative, if you use a line diagram instead of dot diagrams in the first figure. 
- The Figure 2 include the soil respiration values in kg CO2/ha /day, which would be more clear 
with the average values. 
  
Conclusion 
The results have briefly evaluated and conclusions straightforward formulated. I quite agree with 
observations of the study that emphasizes the importance of further microbiological studies.
