Abstract
Differentiated neurons established via iPSCs from patients that suffer from familial Parkinson’s disease (PD) have
allowed insights into the mechanisms of neurodegeneration. In the larger cohort of patients with sporadic PD, iPSC
based information on disease specific cellular phenotypes is rare. We asked whether differences may be present on
genomic and epigenomic levels and performed a comprehensive transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis of
fibroblasts, iPSCs and differentiated neuronal cells of sporadic PD-patients and controls. We found that on mRNA
level, although fibroblasts and iPSCs are largely indistinguishable, differentiated neuronal cells of sporadic PD
patients show significant alterations enriched in pathways known to be involved in disease aetiology, like the CREB-
pathway and the pathway regulating PGC1α. Moreover, miRNAs and piRNAs/piRNA-like molecules are largely
differentially regulated in cells and post-mortem tissue samples between control- and PD-patients. The most
striking differences can be found in piRNAs/piRNA-like molecules, with SINE- and LINE-derived piRNAs highly
downregulated in a disease specific manner. We conclude that neuronal cells derived from sporadic PD-patients
help to elucidate novel disease mechanisms and provide relevant insight into the epigenetic landscape of sporadic
Parkinson’s disease as particularly regulated by small RNAs.

Background
Coding
mutations
like
the
well-known
A53T
α-synuclein and G2019S LRRK2 mutations cause familial
Parkinson’s disease (PD) [38]. Dopaminergic neurons
carrying these mutations obtained via an induced pluri-
potent stem cell (iPSC) intermediate have been shown
to
recapitulate
hallmarks
of
the
neurodegenerative
process in PD like increased susceptibility to oxidative
[42] and nitrosative stress [53].
Much less is known about the possibility to model
sporadic PD with iPSC based models. In sporadic PD
that constitutes about 90% of cases and where none of
the well-known genes causing familial Parkinsonism is
mutated, no single variant in the whole coding sequence
of the human genome was found to be associated with
PD in a recent study [55]. In contrast, alterations in
non-coding regions, which are enriched in PD-related
genes, are well established risk factors for PD [12]. In
addition, alterations of the epigenome in sporadic Par-
kinson’s disease have been reported in brain tissue on
methylation [25] and small RNA level [26] and epigen-
etic alterations are also present in the patients’ periph-
eral blood [24]. Although iPSC reprogramming has been
reported to remove all marks associated with cellular
ageing [39], disease-specific alterations may survive re-
programming and then can impact iPSC function [16],
even allowing for imprinting disorders to be modelled
with iPSCs [7]. Importantly, both small RNAs [62] as
well as methylation [43] can contribute to somatic
memory.

Differential expression of disease associated small RNAs
in cultured, differentiated neurons would allow to recap-
itulate and to study epigenome-mediated pathological al-
terations. Mature miRNAs, which repress target gene
functions both by regulating target mRNA levels as well
as by repression of target mRNA translation, have already
been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease,
e.g. in animal models [47]. PIWI interacting RNAs, a class
of small regulatory RNAs first described in the male germ-
line [13], are less well studied in neuronal cells but have
been implicated in retrotransposon silencing in the brain
[41] as well as regulation of epigenetic modifications [49].
Importantly, piRNAs were recently described to be differ-
entially regulated in Alzheimer’s disease brain tissue [48,
52] connecting them to the process of neurodegeneration.
Most phenotypes observed in neurons differentiated
from cells carrying a mutation that causes familial PD
can only be observed after the cells have been stressed,
implying that the alterations in the coding sequence lead
to a stress-susceptible, primed state in the neurons.
More specifically, increased cell death in neurons carry-
ing the A53T mutation in α-synuclein is observed after
treatment with mitochondrial toxins [53] and in neurons
carrying the G2019S LRRK2 mutation after H2O2 appli-
cation [42].
Under certain circumstances, dopaminergic neurons
derived from sporadic Parkinson’s disease patients have
been reported to show phenotypes similar to genetic
cases
including
cellular
abnormalities
[54],
altered
methylation patterns [12] as well as abnormalities in
protein turnover [18]. Importantly, the epigenomic alter-
ations observed were present in pathways important for
physiological neurodevelopment [12] supporting the hy-
pothesis that these pathways are altered in PD [29] as
has been reported for Alzheimer’s disease [14]. The al-
terations in protein turnover were already present in fi-
broblasts [18] and a large subset of fibroblasts derived
from sporadic PD cases showed increased sensitivity to
valinomycin treatment [58]. As fibroblasts are frequently
used for reprogramming to iPSCs followed by differenti-
ation into neuronal cells, it is possible that an epigenetic
signature survives reprogramming that potentially im-
pacts the function of transplanted cells. More import-
antly, this signature -if present- might provide unique
insights into the disease aetiology of sporadic PD. There-
fore, the Bavarian Research Network Induced Pluripo-
tent Stem Cells (ForIPS) was initiated to test the
hypothesis, which -if any- phenotypes can be observed
in cells derived from sporadic PD-patients.
Based on these premises, we examined a large region
specific cohort of matched fibroblasts, iPSCs and differen-
tiated neuronal cells from healthy individuals and Parkin-
son’s disease patients and applied rigorous quality control
standards. Previous to our analyses, we confirmed the
PD-patients to be negative for all known monogenic forms
of the disease. We aimed to determine in a global and un-
biased approach if there were any epigenetic marks that
distinguish cells from healthy and diseased individuals. In-
deed, we found that cells derived from sporadic Parkin-
son’s disease patients show a unique small RNA signature
and that pathways that are known to be altered in diseased
tissue as well as genetic cases, like the pathway regulating
PGC1α, are deregulated.
Methods
Cell culture, iPSC generation and differentiation to
midbrain neurons
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) were generated
from eight sporadic PD patients and six healthy controls
by retroviral transduction of the four transcription fac-
tors (Oct 3/4, c-Myc, Sox2 and Klf4) as previously de-
scribed [15]. The Institutional Review Board approval
(Nr. 4120: Generierung von humanen neuronalen Mod-
ellen bei neurodegenerativen Erkrankungen) and in-
formed consent forms are on file at the movement
disorder clinic at the Department of Molecular Neur-
ology,
Universitätsklinikum
Erlangen
(Erlangen,
Germany). All the hiPSC lines were cultured in mTeSR
(Stemcell Technologies) or MACSbrew (Miltenyi) on
Geltrex (Gibco® Thermo Fisher Scientific) and splitted
every five to seven days using Collagenase IV or Gentle
Cell Dissociation Reagent (Stemcell Technologies). Pluri-
potency and a stable karyotype were tested by flow cy-
tometry
and
G-banding
chromosomal
analysis,
respectively. One to two hiPSC clones per individual
(Additional file 1: Table S1) were differentiated into
small molecule neural precursor cells (smNPCs) follow-
ing the protocol published by others [50] with some
adaption as described in [59]. The smNPCs were further
differentiated to midbrain neurons within three weeks of
maturation [50, 59]. Briefly, 70% confluent iPSC were
detached by collagenase IV (Gibco® Thermo Fisher Sci-
entific) treatment for 20 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cell col-
onies were cultured as free-floating aggregates in human
embryonic stem cells (hESC) medium (80% KO-DMEM,
20% KO serum replacement, 1% non-essential amino
acids, 1% Penicillin/Streptavidin (all from Thermo Fisher
Scientific), 1 mM ß-Mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich)
supplemented with the small molecules 1 μM LDN
(Stemgent), 10 μM SB, 3 μM Chir, and 0.5 μM Purmor-
phoamine (PMA, all from Tocris) on ultra-low adhesion
plates. After two days of incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO2,
the cell colonies were centred and the medium was
changed to N2B27 medium (50% DMEM/F12, 50% Neu-
robasal Medium, 1:200 N2, 1:100 B27 (all from Thermo
Fisher Scientific) supplemented with the same small
molecules. On day four, the medium was changed to
smNPC medium (N2B27 medium supplemented with 3

uM Chir, 0.5 uM PMA and 150 uM Ascorbic acid (AA;
Sigma-Aldrich). After a total of six days of suspension
culture, cell colonies were replaced on geltrex-coated
(Gibco®

12-well plates in
smNPC medium supplemented with Rho kinase inhibitor
Y27532 (RI, Axxora) for 24 h. Medium was changed every
other day and cells were passaged once a week by accutase
treatment. After at least five passages, smNPCs were dif-
ferentiated into MN. Therefore, two days after passaging,
the medium was exchanged to N2B27 medium supple-
mented with 100 ng/ml FGF8 (Peprotech), 1 μM PMA
and 200 μM AA. On day 10 of differentiation, medium
was supplemented with 100 ng/ml FGF8, 10 ng/ml GDNF
(Peprotech), 10 ng/ml TGFb (eBioscience), 200 uM AA,
and 500 μM Dibutyryl-cAMP (dbcAMP; Sigma-Aldrich.
On the next day, cells were passaged at ratios of 1:2–1:3
as single cells after accutase treatment (Sigma-Aldrich),
plated onto geltrex-coated four-well chamber slides (Ibidi)
or 12-well plates and further cultured for at least two
weeks in maturation medium (N2B27 medium plus

Poly-a RNA library preparation
Libraries for next-generation sequencing were prepared
from 1 μg total RNA with the TrueSeq RNA library
preparation kit v2 according to the manufacturer’s in-
structions (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Briefly,
poly-A RNA was purified from the total RNA prepar-
ation with magnetic oligo-dT beads. The RNA-bead
mixture was incubated at 65 °C for five minutes to de-
nature the RNA. Then, the mixture was incubated for
five minutes at RT to allow the RNA to bind to the
beads. Afterwards, the beads were washed with bead
washing buffer and resuspended in elution buffer for
two minutes at 80 °C. Bead binding buffer was added to
allow rebinding of the eluted RNA. The beads were
washed with bead washing buffer and resuspended in
elute, prime, fragment mix. The RNA was eluted at 94 °
C for eight minutes, and first strand cDNA synthesis
was performed with SuperScript II (Thermo Fisher Sci-
entific, Waltham, MA, USA) in first strand mix supplied
by Illumina. Second strand synthesis was performed with
the second strand mix for one hour at 16 °C and the
resulting double stranded cDNA was purified using
AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA).
Then, end repair was performed for 30 min at 30 °C
with the provided end repair mix. The end repaired
DNA was again cleaned up with AMPure XP beads.
A-tailing was performed with the A-tailing mix at 37 °C
for 30 min followed by 70 °C for five minutes. Indexed
adapters were ligated to the end-repaired A-tailed cDNA
at 30 °C for ten minutes. Next, stop ligation buffer was
added and the libraries were cleaned up with AMPure
XP beads. PCR amplification was performed with the
provided PCR reagents and the following cycling condi-
tions: Denaturation at 98 °C for 30 s and then 15 cycles
of1) 98 °C for 10 s, 2)60 °C for 30 s and 3)72 °C for 30 s.
Afterwards, a final extension at 72 °C for five minutes
was performed and the amplified libraries were purified
again with AMPure XP beads. Finally, quality control
was performed with a Bioanalyser® (Agilent).
RNA library preparation for tissue samples
For all tissue samples (RIN usually < 8), we used the
TrueSeq RNA Access Kit (Illumina) to prepare libraries
from 100 ng total RNA, which is suitable for degraded
RNA. First, first strand cDNA was synthetized with the
Elute, Prime, Fragment High Mix and super script II in
First Strand Master Mix (25 °C for 10 min, 42 °C for
15 min and 70 °C for 15 min). Then, 20 μl Second
Strand Marking Master Mix were added and the second
strand was synthetized for 1 h at 16 °C. The cDNA was
cleaned up with AMPure XP beads and A-tailing was
performed with A-tailing mix (37 °C for 30 min followed
by 5 min at 70 °C). Following this, adapter ligation was
performed with Ligation Mix for 10 min at 30 °C after
which the reaction was stopped with Stop Ligation Buf-
fer. The libraries were cleaned up with AMPure XP
beads and amplified with PCR Master Mix and PCR Pri-
mer Cocktail (98 °C for 30 s, 15 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s,
60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 5 min). Fol-
lowing a further clean up with AMPure XP beads, the li-
braries were quantitated with a Bio-Analyser and 4
libraries were pooled at equal concentrations (200 ng
each) for exome capture, which was repeated twice. For
exome capture, Coding Exome Oligos were added to the
pooled libraries together with Capture Target Buffer 3
and incubated for 95 °C for 10 min and 18 cycles of one
minute incubations, starting at 94 °C, then decreasing
2 °C per cycle with a final incubation for 58 °C for
90 min. Immediately afterwards, the hybridized probes
were captured with streptavidin magnetic beads for
25 min at RT and washed twice with Enrichment Wash
Solution (incubation at 50 °C for 20 min). Finally an Elu-
tion Premix was prepared with Enrichment Elution Buffer
1 and NaOH. The streptavidin beads were resuspended in
this Elution Premix, incubated for two minutes at RT, the
supernatant was separated from the beads on a magnetic
stand and Elute Target Buffer 2 was added to the super-
natant. After the second exome capture, the libraries were
cleaned up with AMPure XP beads. Finally, a second en-
richment was performed with the Enhanced PCR Mix
(98 °C for 30 s followed by 10 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, 60 °
C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s, with a final extension at 72 °
C for 5 min) and the amplified libraries were purified

again with AMPure XP beads. Finally, quality control was
performed with a Bioanalyser® (Agilent).
Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS)
library preparation
Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing allows for
highly accurate and efficient analysis of methylation pat-
terns at single base pair resolution with a focus on CpG
islands [21]. Digestion was performed with 2.5 μg gDNA
in buffer 4 (NEB) and 400 units MSPI O/N at 37 °C.
Afterwards, the DNA was purified from this reaction
with the PCR purification Kit (Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 5 volumes buffer PB
were added to the MSPI digest, applied to a spin column
provided in the kit and centrifugation was performed for
1 min at 9500 × g. Then, the column was washed with
750 μl buffer PE, dried by centrifugation for 1 min at
9500 × g and the DNA was eluted with 30 μl buffer EB.
Library preparation was then performed with the NEXT-
flex™Bisulfite Library Prep Kit (BIOO Scientific) accord-
ing
to
the
manufacturer’s
instructions
with
some
modifications. Briefly, end repair was performed with
500 ng digested, purified DNA in end repair buffer mix
and end repair enzyme mix in a total volume of 50 μl.
The reaction was incubated at 22 °C for 30 min and then
cleaned up with the MinElute® PCR Cleanup Kit. Then,
16.5 μl of the eluate were mixed with 4.5 μl of adenyla-
tion mix and the reaction was incubated for 30 min at
37 °C. Afterwards, 31.5 μl ligation mix and 2.5 μl of indi-
vidual adapters (diluted 1:2) were added, and adapter
ligation was performed for 15′ at 22 °C. Afterwards, the
DNA was cleaned with AMPure XP beads and size se-
lection for fragments from 175 to 400 bp was performed
with a gel purification step. The libraries were separated
on a 2% low melt agarose gel (Sigma-Aldrich), the cut
out gel fragments were dissolved for 10 min at RT in
DNA binding buffer and 150 μl ethanol were added.
Then, the solution was applied to a clean-up spin col-
umn and centrifuged at 18500 xg until the complete vol-
ume was processed. Afterwards, the column was washed
twice with DNA wash buffer, dried by centrifugation and
the DNA was eluted with column elution buffer. Then,
bisulfite conversion of the DNA was performed with the
EZ Methylation Gold Kit (Zymo Research) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 130 μl conver-
sion reagent were added to 20 μl purified DNA. The re-
action was incubated for 10 min at 98 °C and for 2.5 h
at 64 °C. Then, the samples were loaded on spin col-
umns containing 600 μl M-Binding buffer and mixed by
inverting. The DNA was bound to the column by centri-
fugation for 30 s at 18620 x g. Then, the column was
washed with 100 μl wash buffer, and 200 μl desulphona-
tion buffer were added. The desulphonation buffer was
incubated for 17 min at RT, and then removed by
centrifugation. The column was washed twice with
200 μl wash buffer, and dried by centrifugation for 10 s.
Finally, 17 μl elution buffer were added to the column,
incubated for 1 min and the DNA was eluted by centri-
fugation. Afterwards, PCR amplification of the bisulfite
converted libraries was performed with PfuCx Hot Start
(Agilent). 15 μl DNA were amplified with the NEXTflex™
Primer Mix. Cycling conditions were: Initial denatur-
ation for five minutes at 95 °C. Then 18 cycles of 95 °C
for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 45 s. Afterwards a
final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The libraries were
purified again using AMPure XP beads (Beckmann
Coulter). Finally, quality control with a Bioanalyser®
(Agilent) was performed.
Small RNA library preparation
Small RNA libraries were prepared from 1 μg total
RNA containing small RNAs with the TrueSeq Small
RNA kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s in-
structions. Briefly, a 3’adapter was added to the RNA,
denaturation was performed for two minutes at 70 °C
and afterwards the mixture was put on ice immediately.
Then, the adapter was ligated with a T4 RNA Ligase2
deletion mutant (epicentre) for 1 h at 28 °C. Then the
reaction was stopped with stop solution for 15 min at
28 °C, the previously denatured 5′ adapter was added
together with ATP and T4 DNA Ligase and ligated to
the RNA for 1 h at 28 °C. After that, cDNA synthesis
was performed with super script II and Illumina sup-
plied dNTPs for 1 h at 50 °C. Afterwards, the cDNA
was amplified and indexed with the primers and PCR
mix supplied in the kit (eleven cycles of denaturation at
98 °C for 10 s, annealing 60 °C for 30 s and extension
at 72 °C for 15 s with a final extension at 72 for
10 min) and size selection was performed on 5% TBE
acrylamide gels (Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany). Here, the
region marked by Illumina’s custom ladder between
145 bp and 160 bp were cut out and pooled for sequen-
cing. The gel was homogenized by centrifugation at
20000 x g through a gel breaker tube (Bio-Cat) and
300 μl ultrapure H2O were added to elute the DNA O/
N in a DNA LoBind tube (Eppendorf). The following
day, the gel debris was separated from the water by
centrifugation for 10 s at 600 xg through a 5 μm filter
tube (Bio-Cat). Then, 2 μl glycogen (CALBIOCHEM),
30 μl sodium acetate (Thermo-Fisher Scientific), 2 μl
0.1× pellet paint and 975 μl prechilled 100% ethanol
were added and the mixture was incubated for 20 min
at −80 °C. Then, the library was pelleted by centrifuga-
tion for 20 min at 4 °C and 20,000 xg, washed with 70%
ethanol and recentrifuged for 5 min. Finally, the etha-
nol was removed, the pellet dried for five minutes at
37 °C and resuspended in 15 μl ultrapure water.

Next-generation sequencing
Illumina deep sequencing as well as quantification of
small RNA content were performed at a genomics core
facility: Center of Excellence for Fluorescent Bioanalytics
(KFB, University of Regensburg, Germany). For deep se-
quencing, all libraries were quantified using the KAPA
SYBR FAST ABI Prism Library Quantification Kit (Kapa
Biosystems, Woburn, MA, USA). Equimolar amounts of
each library were used for cluster generation on the cBot
with the TruSeq SR Cluster Kit v3 (Illumina, San Diego,
CA, USA). The sequencing run was performed on a
HiSeq 1000 instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA)
using the indexed, 50 cycles single read (SR) protocol
and the TruSeq SBS v3 Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA,
USA). Image analysis and base calling resulted in .bcl
files which were then converted into .fastq files by the
CASAVA1.8.2 software.
Data analysis for (small) RNA libraries
Analysis of poly-A RNA, RNA enriched with the coding
exome oligos and small RNA data was performed using
the
Genomatix
software
(Genomatix,
Munich,
Germany). For poly-A RNA and RNA enriched with the
coding exome oligos, the .fastq files were mapped to the
human genome assembly GRCh38 (annotation based on
ElDorado 6–2015) using the Genomatix Mining Station
Mapper v3.7.6.3 allowing one mismatch. We sequenced
all poly-A RNA libraries until at least 15 * 106 and all ex-
ome capture libraries until at least 10 × 106 unique hits
per sample could be mapped. All unique hits were fur-
ther processed using the Genomatix Genome Analyser
v3.51106 which was used to create count tables and
RPKM expression values for all samples. Reads were
counted locus-based, i.e. for unions of exons of genes.
All further analyses based on these count tables were
performed with the free software R v3.1.1, Bioconductor
v3.0 [20] and the package DESeq2 v1.6.3 [36]. Gene set
enrichment analysis [53] was performed with GenePat-
tern and the GSEA module v18 [53] with RPKM (reads
per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads)
values and gene sets c2.Biocarta as well as c2.KEGG
using standard settings. For small RNA analysis, we
mapped .fastq files against a small RNA library based on
GRCh38 (annotation based on ElDorado 6–2015) allow-
ing one mismatch. Afterwards, count tables were created
for each small RNA type (piRNA, mature miRNA,
miRNA hairpin structures) with the small RNA work-
flow available in the Genomatix Genome Analyser. We
sequenced all samples until at least 1 × 106 counts for ma-
ture miRNAs were reached when reads were counted,
with a mean of unique hits for mature miRNAs of
3,037,413 ± 2088,481and for piRNA 9,754,231 ± 4,096,709.
All further single locus based analyses were performed as
described for poly-A RNA. For further analysis of piRNAs,
we matched the RNAdb2.0 identifiers [45], on which Gen-
omatix is based, to the pIRbase [66], which provides infor-
mation on the genomic localization, sequence as well as
the elements from which the respective piRNAs are de-
rived. Parts of the poly-A RNA-Seq dataset were gener-
ated in a collaborative project and three poly-A RNA-Seq
runs from neurons are also contained/analysed in [59].
RRBS analysis
For RRBS, .fastq files were trimmed with TRIM Galore
v0.4.2 in the rrbs mode and mapped with BISMARK
v0.16.3 [28] to the human genome GRCh38.84 as ob-
tained from www.ensembl.org. Then, the methylation
values were extracted with the BISMARK methylation
extractor again removing 2 bp at the five prime end of
the reads to remove the methylation bias in untrimmed
reads stemming from the end repair procedure. We se-
quenced the libraries until at least 1 × 106 alignments
with a unique best hit were found by BISMARK. All fur-
ther analyses were performed based on extracted cover-
age files with RnBeads v1.2.0 [4].
Data availability
All normalized NGS data were deposited in GEO (URL:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo)
under
the
super
series accession GSE110720. Coding exome RNA-Seq
data is deposited under accession GSE110716, Poly-A
RNA-Seq data is deposited under accession GSE110717,
RRBS data is deposited under accession GSE110718 and
small RNA-Seq data under accession GSE110719.
Quality control and inclusion criteria
Due to historical reasons, the mRNA data for quality
control analyses of iPSCs were mapped to the human
genome GRCh37 without mismatch. We included all
samples that we analysed, as long as they met the follow-
ing criteria: iPSCs had to show a marker expression of
the pluripotency markers DNMT3B, SOX2, NANOG,
OCT4 and REX1 within the range of a previously ana-
lysed high quality ESC cohort and to fall at least in the
safety margin of a previously established database driven
PluriTest adaption [57]. Furthermore, viral transgene si-
lencing had to be comparable to a published cohort for
which NGS raw data was freely available [1]. We ana-
lysed viral transgene silencing both by comparison of
RPKM values of established markers of viral transgene
silencing [27] as well as by direct mapping of the plas-
mids used for reprogramming counting multiple and
unique hits when mapping against the vector sequence
(excluding the coding regions of the pluripotency fac-
tors) normalized to the number of unique hits of the re-
spective sequencing run when mapped to the genome.
The upper-limit cut-offs shown in the supplementary
material were calculated as described in [57]. SNPs were

called within the Genomatix Genome analyser with a
workflow based on samtools, with at least 4 x coverage
per SNP and exclusion of indels. We excluded five iPSC
lines based on these criteria.
Patient samples, tissue samples and embryonic stem cells
The Institutional Review Board approval (Nr. 4120: Gen-
erierung von humanen neuronalen Modellen bei neuro-
degenerativen
Erkrankungen)
and
informed
consent
forms are on file at the movement disorder clinic at the
Department of Molecular Neurology, Universitätsklini-
kum Erlangen (Erlangen, Germany). All procedures in-
volving patient samples (tissues or cells) were approved
by the local institutional review board (Ethikkommission
Regensburg), approval 14–101-0216. The experiments
involving embryonic stem cells were approved by the
Central Ethics Committee for Stem Cell Research in
Germany according to StZG (AZ: 3.04.02/0121). Tissue
samples were obtained from the Netherlands brain bank
as fresh frozen tissue. iPSCs were generated from skin
biopsies of PD- and control-patients by the ForIPS core
project as described elsewhere [15].
Immunohistochemistry
The presence of Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra and
more importantly in the cingulum was verified with
stained sections from the Netherlands brain bank (NBB).
For those cases were no staining was available, we ob-
tained paraffin sections from the NBB and performed a
staining with an antibody directed against aggregated
α-synuclein (anti-human α-synuclein 5G4, mouse mono-
clonal, analytikjena, Jena, Germany). After deparaffiniza-
tion, antigen retrieval was performed by cooking in
citrate buffer for 20 min and DAB staining was per-
formed with the Envision Dual Link System-HRP DAB+
Kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the sections were
blocked
with
Dual
Endogenous
Enzyme
Block
for
10 min and rinsed with PBS. Then, primary antibody
was applied (diluted 1:500 in PBS + 1% BSA) for 40 min
and again the slides were washed with PBS. Afterwards,
labelled polymer was added for 30 min. After a further
washing step, substrate was added for five minutes.
Afterwards, the slides were washed in running tap water,
counterstained in hemalaun (Dako/Agilent) and again
rinsed in running tap water. Finally, the slides were
dehydrated in increasing ethanol concentrations and xy-
lol and mounted in entellan mounting medium (Merck).
Methyl-cytosine staining
For analysis of methyl-cytosine content in tissue, we cut
frozen tissue sections from the cingulate gyrus material.
The DAB staining was performed with the Envision Dual
Link System-HRP DAB+ Kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with
some modifications. After cutting and thawing, the sec-
tions were first fixed with 4% PFA for 15 min, which was
necessary as we retrieved unfixed material. Then the sec-
tions were washed three times for five minutes in TBS.
Afterwards, the slides were incubated for 30 min in 2 N
HCl for antigen retrieval. The slides were washed twice
with PBS and blocking was performed with the Dual En-
dogenous Enzyme Block reagent for 10 min at RT. After
further washing in TBS, anti-methyl-cytosine (Epigentek,
mouse monoclonal, clone 33D3) antibody was added in
1:400 dilution and incubated O/N at 4 °C in 1% normal
goat serum (PAN Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany) in TBS
+ 0.3% TritonX. A mouse IgG (Thermo-Fisher) was used
as negative control. The next day, the slides were washed
three times, covered with labelled polymer and incu-
bated for 30 min at RT. Then, after one washing with
TBS, the sections were covered with chromogen for
10 min. Afterwards, the slides were washed in running
tap water, counterstained in Mayer’s hemalaun and again
rinsed in running tap water. Finally, the slides were
dehydrated in increasing ethanol concentrations and xy-
lol (Carl-Roth) and mounted in entellan mounting
medium (Merck).
cDNA synthesis, real-time PCR and semiquantitative PCR
cDNA synthesis was performed from 200 ng total RNA
using random hexamer primers (Gene Link, Hawthorne,
NY, USA) and the SuperScript™II Reverse Transcriptase
(Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s in-
structions. Real-time RT-PCR was performed with the Sen-
siFAST™SYBR Hi-Rox Kit (Bioline, London, UK) on the
StepOnePlus™cycler (Life Technologies). Relative expres-
sion values were calculated with the ΔΔCT (analysis of rela-
tive gene expression) method [35] using ARF-1 as the
reference
transcript.

Statistics
All statistical analyses of NGS data were performed with
the software packages described above and standard set-
tings, unless otherwise indicated. A (small-) RNA locus
was defined as differentially regulated when it was
deregulated at a log2FC of ≥0.6 and an adjusted p-value
of < 0.1. For analysis of methylation data a cytosine was
accepted as differentially methylated when it passed the
threshold Δ-meth ≥0.2 and an adjusted p-value of < 0.1.
A gene set was accepted as differentially enriched at a
p-value < 0.05 and a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.25.
Otherwise, all statistical tests used are provided in the
figure legends and the results part together with the
sample size. All bar graphs show the mean + standard
deviation (SD) unless otherwise indicated.
Results
Patient recruitment, cell line establishment and quality
control
We gained skin fibroblasts from six healthy control- and
nine sporadic Parkinson’s disease (PD)-patients within
the Bavarian Research Network Induced Pluripotent
Stem Cells (ForIPS). All samples were derived from
inner upper arm skin biopsy derived fibroblasts. Early
passage fibroblast samples were reprogrammed to iPSCs
using retroviral reprogramming Yamanaka factors. From
all except one patient (PD7) iPSC lines were established,

and finally a subset of these lines was further differenti-
ated to midbrain neurons (MN) (Additional file 1: Table
S1 for details on the patient cohort).
Analysis of the transcriptome showed that fibroblasts,
iPSCs and differentiated neuronal cells -as expected-
had globally distinct gene expression patterns (Fig. 1a).
Our neurons clustered well in a principal component
analysis with dopaminergic neurons published by others
[34] (Fig. 1b). We then validated that all iPSCs corre-
sponded to high quality pluripotent cells according to
our recent PluriTest adaption for NGS [57] (Fig. 1c).
This means that all cell preparations mapped at least
within a calculated statistical cut-off, with most prepara-
tions also meeting the requirements of an empirical
cut-off of high quality pluripotent cells (for further infor-
mation see [57]). We checked for the expression of plur-
ipotency marker genes (in the range of high quality
pluripotent cells, Additional file 2: Figure S1), ensured
that cells showed viral transgene silencing (examined by
direct mapping to the vector sequences used for repro-
gramming) and excluded that markers of insufficient
viral transgene silencing were overexpressed [27] (Fig.
1d and e). In addition, we performed a SNP based pater-
nity testing for every reprogrammed and differentiated
line. All cell lines used for further analyses met these
stringent quality criteria.
The neuronal cells showed robust induction of the
dopaminergic neuron marker TH, and there was no sig-
nificant difference between the control- and PD-group
in the expression of TH, EN1, MAP2, FOXA2, KCNJ6,
SYP2, TUBB3 and NURR1 (two-sided Mann-Whitney
test, p > 0.05 for all comparisons, n = 8 CTRL and 7 PD
derived MN neurons, Additional file 3: Figure S2). In
addition the cells were not showing morphological dif-
ferences or increased cell death without stressor [59] as
has been described for genetic models of the disease [42,
53].
Disease-specific phenotypes in differentiated neurons on
mRNA level
A
hierarchical

based
on
mRNA
data
(TOP2000 variable genes, rlog-normalized) clustered the
samples by cell type, but no distinct groups were de-
tected for PD- and control-patient derived cells (Fig. 2a).
We then went on to examine differential gene expres-
sion between control- and PD-derived cell populations
within every cell type and adjusted our model for differ-
ential expression for the covariate gender and for the
iPSCs additionally for passage number. As ageing marks
have been reported to be removed in four-factor repro-
grammed cells [39], we did not include age as a covariate
in the analysis of iPSCs and differentiated neurons, but
only for fibroblasts.
It became evident that relevant differential gene ex-
pression between the PD- and control-group could only
be observed in neuronal cells with 97 deregulated loci,
but not in fibroblasts with 3 or iPSCs with 11 deregu-
lated loci (log2FC ≥0.6, p-adj. < 0.1, Fig. 2b and Add-
itional file 4: Table S2). Analysing these alterations in
neuronal cells on the single gene level, genes that belong
to the WNT-pathway were deregulated, i.e. WNT3 was
upregulated in PD-patient derived neurons (two-sided
Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.05, n = 8 CTRL neurons and 7
PD neurons, Fig. 2c). On the pathway level, the NOS1-
and CREB-pathways as well as the pathway regulating
PGC1α (among others) were significantly inactivated in
PD-patient derived neurons (p < 0.05, FDR < 0.25, n = 8
CTRL neurons and 7 PD neurons, Figs. 2d and e and
Additional file 5: Table S3). Both, the PGC1α- and
CREB-pathway are well-known and important regulators
of neuronal cell survival [23, 67]. As such, these findings
provided first implications for the usefulness of neuronal
models derived from sporadic PD-patients via the iPSC
stage for disease modelling and prompted us to further
examine the epigenome of our cell lines across differen-
tiation stages.
A disease-specific piRNA/piRNA-like molecule signature is
present across all differentiation stages
Next, we examined the small RNA expression patterns
via NGS in all 15 fibroblast cell lines, 24 iPSC lines, two
hESC lines and ten lines differentiated to midbrain neu-
rons. When PD-patient derived cells were compared
with controls, there were 26 deregulated miRNAs in fi-
broblasts, 34 in iPSCs and 40 in neurons (p-adj < 0.1,
logFC ≥0.6, Additional file 6: Figure S3A and Additional
file 7: Table S4). For mature miRNAs, the first important
finding was that let-7 family members are upregulated in
PD-patient derived neurons (Additional file 6: Figure
S3B). The let-7 family has been reported to be deregu-
lated in a C. elegans model of PD [3] and this might be
another regenerative mechanism, like WNT-pathway
upregulation, in PD-derived neurons.
Even more strikingly, we found a high number of
PIWI interacting RNAs (piRNAs) differentially regulated
in all cell populations (Fig. 3a and Additional file 8:
Table S5). We next checked if genes that control piRNA
biogenesis are actually expressed in cultured neurons.
Indeed, PIWIL2 and PIWIL4 expression were detectable
in cultured midbrain neurons (Fig. 3b) which is similar
to results that others have published from tissue in
mouse [41] and human [60]. Importantly, when we ex-
amined all 15 fibroblast lines and a subset of 13 PD iPSC
and 10 control iPSC lines as well as two hESC lines for
total small RNA content, there were no significant dif-
ferences (Kruskall-Wallis test, p > 0.05, Additional file 9:
Figure S4A). We also asked if our library preparation
Schulze et al. Acta Neuropathologica Communications  (2018) 6:58 
Page 8 of 18
included the correct length fraction of piRNAs. With
our library preparation protocol, we expect the 24–
32 bp piRNAs to run approximately between 150 and
160 bp, slightly higher than 22 bp mature miRNAs. The
library sizes of small RNA libraries showed peaks in this
size range (Additional file 9: Figure S4B). Of course, it
should be noted that other RNA species, e.g. iso-mirs
can also be present in these higher size ranges. As con-
tamination of piRNAs with other RNAs, i.e. snoRNA
degradation products has been a concern for IP based
approaches [49], we checked the overlap between the
piRNA sequences we used for piRNA mapping [66] and
a snoRNA database [32]. However, as the overlap with
snoRNAs was negligible and as the piRNAs identified by
us showed the typical 5-prime Uridine bias, we conclude
that we identified bona fide piRNA sequences. Nonethe-
less, as a length of 24–32 bp is another important criter-
ion for canonical piRNAs [68] we checked the length

of deregulated genes is only present in neurons, but not in fibroblasts or iPSCs. c WNT3 is differentially expressed between control- and PD-
patient derived cells as judged by real-time PCR (two-sided Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.05). Shown are means + SD. d The NOS1- and CREB-

fractions of our sequenced libraries after adapter trimming
(data not shown). Due to the fact that there were less
reads in the range of 24–32 bp than unique piRNA hits,
we conclude that our dataset contains canonical piRNAs
and piRNA-like molecules that are abundantly expressed
outside of the testes as has been described by others [64].
For simplicity, piRNAs and piRNA-like molecules are re-
ferred to as piRNAs in the rest of the manuscript.

already differentially expressed in parental fibroblasts) are present, but constitute a minor fraction (< 10%) of all deregulated piRNAs in iPSCs/ESCs
and neurons. e Plot of cytosine content in all deregulated piRNAs over nucleotide positions 1 to 29. In the first 10 nucleotides, cytosines are
overrepresented in the upregulated piRNAs (green line) as compared to all piRNAs analysed (dark red line). This observation does not apply to
the downregulated piRNAs (blue line). f SINE- and LINE-derived piRNAs are highly enriched in the downregulated piRNA fraction in neurons.
SINE- and LINE-derived piRNAs (but not LTR- or gene-derived piRNAs) are significantly enriched in the fraction of downregulated piRNAs as
compared to their abundance in the genome (two-sided chi-square test, p < 0.0001 and p < 0.01, respectively)

separate clusters in a hierarchical clustering analysis
(Fig. 3c). However, the fraction of memory piRNAs (i.e.
piRNAs that were differentially regulated between PD-
and control-patient derived iPSCs/neurons and already
found deregulated in fibroblasts) was rather low and al-
ways below 10% of all deregulated piRNAs (Fig. 3d).
Only two piRNAs, piR-48,442 and piR-43,518, were
deregulated between PD- and control-patients across
all cell types (Additional file 8: Table S5).
Among the upregulated piRNAs, there was a strong
enrichment of cytosine content within the bases two
to nine of the piRNAs as compared to the reference
of all piRNAs (Fig. 3e).
We then analysed with the annotations provided in the
piRBase [66] from which elements the deregulated piR-
NAs were derived. Interestingly, SINE- and LINE-derived
piRNAs were significantly enriched among the downregu-
lated piRNAs as compared to the genome-wide abun-
dance of all piRNAs analysed in our study (two-sided
chi-square test, p < 0.0001 and p < 0.01, respectively, Fig.
3f). Despite massive piRNA deregulation, however, we
could not find any overlap between known PD-risk loci
and predicted piRNA loci in the human genome (data not
shown).
We conclude that -dependent on the cell type ana-
lysed- the aberrant small RNAome is activated at differ-
ent differentiation stages but only few deregulated
piRNAs are shared between these stages.
piRNA expression differences in differentiation
As there were striking differences in piRNA expres-
sion between PD- and control-patient derived cells,
we hypothesized that piRNAs should be altered by
neural induction in control cells, too. Indeed, piRNAs
underwent dramatic changes after induction of pluri-
potency
and neural differentiation and were even
more
dynamically
regulated
as
mature
miRNAs
(Fig. 4a and Additional file 10: Table S6). As many
piRNAs
showed
a
low
individual
abundance,
we
checked
the
20
most
abundant
and
differentially
expressed (logFC ≥0.6 and p-adj. < 0.1) and therefore
potentially most important piRNAs in the comparison
iPSC vs. neuronal cells that constitute on average
19.33 ± 7.49% (mean ± SD) of all piRNA counts across
neurons and iPSCs (Fig. 4b). Importantly, among all
deregulated piRNAs, again SINE-derived piRNAs were
overrepresented in the comparison fibroblasts (n = 6) vs.
iPSCs/ESCs (n = 16) and iPSC/ESC vs. neurons (n = 5)
(two-sided chi-square test, p < 0.001 and p < 0.0001, re-
spectively, Fig. 4c). As expected, a hierarchical clustering
based on the TOP100 differentially expressed piRNAs
separated control-patient derived neurons and iPSCs
(Fig. 4d).
Tissue validation of mRNA and mi/piRNA expression
patterns
For the evaluation of small RNA expression pattern in PD
tissue, we used material from the cingulate gyrus of eight
healthy and eight Parkinson’s disease patients. We verified
that the PD-patient derived tissues from the cingulate gyrus
were positive for Lewy bodies (Fig. 5a). When analysing dif-
ferential gene expression, we realized that oligodendrocyte
marker genes were overrepresented in control patients, des-
pite of the fact that classical cell type markers (GFAP,
OLIG1/2/3, TUBB3 and RBFOX3) remained unchanged.
We therefore included neuronal content (calculated as de-
scribed in material and methods) as a covariate. A de-
creased transcriptional contribution of the oligodendrocyte
lineage in Parkinson’s patients had been reported previously
[22]. Importantly, the mean RPKM of the marker gene sets
reported by others in mouse [6] was very specific for hu-
man cells and neuronal and glial markers were highly cor-
related (Additional file 11: Figure S5).
With correction for cell type abundance, there were
many deregulated small RNAs at logFC ≥0.6, p-adj. p < 0.1
between PD- and control-patients (Fig. 5b and Additional
file 12: Table S7). In our cohort, four miRNAs overlapped
between tissue and neurons when control- and PD-patient
derived cells were compared (Fig. 5c). As we found many
deregulated piRNAs in neurons, we tested if there is ex-
pression of PIWIL2 and PIWIL4. Indeed, expression of
both genes was detectable in all tissue samples (Fig. 5d).
In addition, there was abundant deregulation of
piRNAs, effectively separating PD and control cases
based on the TOP100 differentially expressed piRNAs
(sorted by adjusted p-value, Fig. 6a). Although -as ex-
pected- differentially expressed piRNAs were largely
different between cultured cells and tissues, there was
an overlap of 70 piRNAs that deserve future evalu-
ation as diagnostic marker (Fig. 6b). We again ob-
served an overrepresentation of cytosines among the
upregulated piRNAs in the second to ninth base (Fig.
6c). Importantly, both SINE- and LINE-derived piR-
NAs were enriched among the downregulated piRNAs
in tissue, as was described for neurons above, al-
though this reached significance only for LINE-derived el-
ements (two-sided chi-square test, p < 0.05, Fig. 6d).
Of note, enrichment of cytosines within the first 10 bp
and overrepresentation of SINE- and LINE-derived ele-
ments among the downregulated piRNAs was not con-
sistently retained in fibroblasts and iPSCs. Therefore,
aberrant piRNA expression is unmasked in differentiated
neurons, but there is no significant epigenetic memory
present within the small RNA fraction.
Only cell type specific differences exist in CpG methylation
We then examined differential methylation between
control and PD cell lines. We successfully sequenced

more than 400,000 CpGs at a coverage ≥5× measured in
every sample. We analysed 15 fibroblast lines (n = 6 in
the CTRL group and n = 9 in the PD group), 28 pluripo-
tent stem cell preparations (n = 16 in the CTRL group
and n = 12 in the PD group), ten midbrain dopaminergic
neurons (n = 5 in the CTRL group and n = 5 in the PD
group). Sequences were highly enriched in CpG islands,
CpG island shores and functional elements, as expected.
There were differences in global methylation patterns
between
cell
types,
but
not
between
PD-
and
control-patient derived cells (Additional file 13: Figure
S6 A-C). Even after restricting the analysis to autosomes
and stringent removal of low variability regions there
were only very few differentially methylated CpGs (cut-off
Δmeth ≥0.2, p-adj. < 0.1, data not shown) in fibroblasts
(36 CpGs), iPSCs (6 CpGs) or neurons (45 CpGs) and no
difference in the mean methylation pattern of any
well-covered (at least 5 CpGs per promoter with 5× cover-
age) gene promoter of known monogenic PD genes (Add-
itional file 13: Figure S6D).
Thus, global methylation patterns that had been found
to be reduced in late stage disease [33], were unaltered in
vitro as judged by RRBS. This finding was confirmed in
the tissues where no differences in methyl-cytosine stain-
ing could be observed between PD- and control-patients
(Additional file 14: Figure S7). In comparison with a previ-
ous study [12] that reported global methylation differences
between PD- and control-patient derived neurons we used
another protocol for iPSC derivation as well as neuronal
differentiation.
We

experimental setup there is no methylation-based epigen-
etic memory or any disease-specific alteration in the CpG
context in sporadic PD-patient derived cells.
Finally, we analysed mtDNA methylation patterns on
the basis of our RRBS data as well as mtDNA mass and
mtDNA deletions by real-time PCR. There were no sig-
nificant differences between PD- and control-patient de-
rived cells but again only between cell types themselves
(Kruskall-Wallis test followed by Dunn’s multiple com-
parison test, Additional file 15: Figure S8).
Discussion
Systematic screening for phenotypes in cells established
from well-defined cohorts of sporadic PD-patients has not
been performed, yet. Therefore, as part of the ForIPS con-
sortium, we aimed to elucidate if sporadic PD-patient de-
rived cells carry any alterations as compared to matched
control patients. We can show that PD-patient derived
cells show a specific small RNA signature in every cell
type examined.
Several studies have suggested similarities between
cells established from genetic and sporadic cases in cer-
tain assays [12, 18, 54]. To identify the molecular basis
of such potential disease phenotypes we performed a
comprehensive analysis of mRNA and small RNA ex-
pression patterns as well as methylation analysis at sin-
gle base resolution in a unique cohort of fibroblasts,
iPSCs and differentiated midbrain neurons from spor-
adic PD-patients. In classical phenotypic assays, the mid-
brain neurons differentiated from sporadic PD-patients
did not show a cellular phenotype [59].
Nonetheless, on the mRNA level, the pathway regulat-
ing PGC1α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ
coactivator-1α) is
inactivated in PD-patient derived

patient tissues (azure). b Venn diagrams of all upregulated and downregulated piRNAs in tissue and neurons. There are 70 shared piRNAs that
may be suited as diagnostic markers. c Plot of cytosine content in all deregulated piRNAs over nucleotide positions 1 to 29 in tissue. In the first
10 nucleotides, cytosines are overrepresented in the upregulated piRNAs (green line) as compared to all piRNAs (dark red line). This phenomenon
is not present in the downregulated piRNAs (blue line). d SINE- and LINE-derived piRNAs are enriched in the downregulated piRNA fraction in
tissue. SINE- and LINE-derived piRNAs are enriched in the fraction of downregulated piRNAs as compared to their abundance in the genome,
although this effect is only significant for LINE-derived piRNAs (two-sided chi-square test, p < 0.05)

midbrain neurons, which was previously reported to be
involved in disease-specific phenotypes in an A53T
model of PD [53] and is a hallmark of PD pathology
[67]. PGC1α is a master regulator of mitochondrial func-
tion and protects neurons from apoptotic cell death
under stress conditions in in vitro models of PD [53,
67]. In addition, the CREB-(cAMP response element
binding protein) pathway, which is a known neuropro-
tective pathway [23], was impaired in PD-patient derived
neurons. CREB proteins, which are transcription factors
mediating cAMP responses, (besides their function in
cell survival) are involved in numerous processes in the
nervous system, e.g. memory formation and neurogen-
esis [44]. Importantly, CREB-activity is modulated by
PGC1α [9] connecting the identified pathways on a
functional level. On a single gene level we found a sig-
nificant PD-associated effect on the transcriptome in dif-
ferentiated neurons, while fibroblasts or iPSCs showed
no differences. Among the genes deregulated in neur-
onal cells, there were several WNT-pathway members.
These have been reported to be hypermethylated in PD
[65] and upregulation of these genes in our midbrain
neurons might serve as a protective mechanism as re-
ported in a PD mouse model [31]. In addition, genes
and pathways regulating neurodevelopment that func-
tion downstream of WNT signals and play a role in mid-
brain development, i.e. LMX1B [29] and OTX2 [12],
have been suggested to be involved in PD pathogenesis.
We add the WNT-pathway members WNT3, ANT3A
and WNT9B to this catalogue.
We furthermore show that neuronally differentiated
cells show striking similarities with diseased tissue on the
level of small RNAs. Here we detected the differential
regulation
of
many
PIWI
interacting
RNAs
and/or
piRNA-like molecules. Importantly, it has been reported
by others that the orthologues of PIWI-proteins are
expressed in the mammalian brain [37, 41]. Although piR-
NAs were first described in testes where they show the
highest abundance [2], a large number of subsequent
studies have identified their presence in the mammalian
brain including studies on human tissue [10, 30, 41, 48,
52]. PiRNAs play an important role for retrotransposon si-
lencing in the brain [41] and retrotransposon activation
contributes to the genetic mosaicism in neurons in Dros-
ophila [46]. Retrotransposon encoding loci are hypo-
methylated in mice deficient for a mouse orthologue of
PIWI (MILI) [41]. On the functional level, chromatin
modification and transcriptional repression are guided by
piRNAs [19]. Moreover, piRNAs modulate synaptic plasti-
city in Aplysia neurons via CREB2 in response to sero-
tonin [49] as well as dendritic spine size in mammalian
cells [30]. Of note, others have recently described deregu-
lated piRNA expression in Alzheimer’s disease, emphasiz-
ing the relevance of piRNAs for neurodegenerative
diseases [48, 52]. We identfied a number of piRNAs that
are shared between diseased PD-patient brain tissue and
cultured neuronal cells. Importantly, the overrepresenta-
tion of LINE- and SINE-derived piRNAs among the
downregulated
piRNAs
points
towards
a
failure
of
PD-patient derived neurons to properly silence these ele-
ments. In addition, by analysing the size fraction of the
piRNAs, we can show that both bona fide piRNAs as well
as piRNA-like molecules contribute to the pool of deregu-
lated sequences. This is important, as the catalogues of
deregulated piRNAs in brain tissue from other diseases
[10, 52, 56] will most likely also contain a significant num-
ber of piRNA-like sequences. These are abundant outside
of the testes [64], but their function is less well understood
than that of canonical piRNAs.
It has been reported that sporadic PD-patient derived
neurons show aberrant protein turnover, altered morph-
ology and methylation patterns when compared to
control-patient derived cells [12, 18, 54]. We extend
these findings by completely tracing the cells on epige-
nomic and transcriptomic level from the primary fibro-
blasts
through
the
iPSC
stage
to
the
neuronally
differentiated stage. More importantly, we can show that
the alterations are detectable with the widely used proto-
cols of OKSM reprogramming followed by differenti-
ation to midbrain neurons. Interestingly, neither on the
methylation nor the small RNA level there were changes
that would comprise a significant epigenetic memory.
Only the PD-patient derived neurons had alterations
that were comparable to the diseased tissue. However,
we cannot completely rule out the possibility that epi-
genetic memory persists in epigenetic modifications that
were not analysed in our study, e.g. on histones, as has
been reported in other systems [17].
There may be some other limitations to our study that
should be shortly mentioned: 1) We used a classical retro-
viral four factor reprogramming cocktail. Reprogramming
with non-integrating vectors like Sendai-viruses or pure
RNA may provide a platform for functional studies less
prone to effects due to reprogramming factor integration
into the genome. 2) Our study is focused on the analysis
of mRNA/small RNA expression and DNA methylation
patterns. Biochemical validation of the effects of deregu-
lated piRNAs/piRNA-like molecules and pathways will be
an active area of future research when the appropriate
tools are available. 3) Further examination of cortically dif-
ferentiated neurons and/or laser capture microdissection
of purified dopaminergic neurons from the substantia
nigra could support and refine the conclusions on disease
etiology of different types of neurons both in the in vitro
and in vivo setting.
Nonetheless, our study implies that disease modelling
with cells derived from sporadic PD cases is possible.
We conclude that although four factor reprogramming

removes ageing associated marks [39] and iPSCs from
healthy individuals are equivalent to ESCs [5, 8], Parkin-
son’s disease derived neuronal cells show disease-specific
alterations on transcriptomic and epigenetic level. More
importantly, we show that both in neurons and in
post-mortem brain tissue from PD-patients, piRNAs are
deregulated in a similar fashion, which is a striking new
finding both in the field of PD as well as cell biology re-
search. We support this findings with a total number of
more than 200 next-generation sequencing runs (DNA
methylation, microRNAs, mRNAs) on one of the largest
collectives of high-quality PD-derived cell preparations
that is available in the field.
