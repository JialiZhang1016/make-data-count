Abstract
1.	 Private lands contain much of the world’s biodiversity. Conservation of private 
land, especially agricultural land, is urgent yet challenging because of the diverse 
priorities of landowners. Local effects of farmland conservation programmes 
have been evaluated thoroughly, but population-level response to these pro-
grammes may depend on effects that extend beyond targeted land parcels. We 
investigated the landscape-scale effects of a grassland conservation initiative, 
the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP), on a socially and eco-
nomically important game bird, the Northern Bobwhite Colinus virginianus.
2.	 Barriers to assessing population-level response to conservation include determin-
ing the spatial scale at which a species responds to environmental change (the 
scale of effect) and untangling density-dependent processes. We performed point 
counts over 6 years at 247 sites with similar local CREP density but varying land-
scape-scale CREP density. We used an open-population distance sampling model 
to evaluate population response to landscape-level CREP density and to forecast 
population densities under differing re-enrolment scenarios. Our model included 
kernel smoothing techniques to estimate scale of effect and an estimator of the 
strength of density dependence.
3.	 Density dependence moderated the effectiveness of the CREP, but overall popu-
lations responded positively to increasing landscape-scale CREP density. We esti-
mated that at least 5% of the landscape needs to be in CREP to meet population 
density goals of 0.25 bobwhite/ha. Conservatively, we recommend 10% of the 
landscape to be in CREP. Our percent cover recommendations are based on a 
distance-weighted average of CREP around focal sites.
4.	 Landscape-scale effects diminished with distance. For example, assuming all else 
is equal, a CREP field 3,000 m away had 88% less of an effect on local abundance 
than a field 1,000 m away. Fields farther than 5,000 m away had no effect on local 
abundance.
5.	 Synthesis and applications. Our study underscores the importance of a landscape-
scale approach to farmland conservation. Benefits of these programmes to wild-
life can extend beyond the local scale, but their importance to local populations

1 | INTRODUCTION
Government policy can establish guidelines or goals for wildlife 
conservation, but on-­the-­ground implementation over broad-­spatial 
scales is complicated by the different priorities of landowners and 
varying opportunities for conservation delivery (Morgan, Sprandel, 
Robinson, & Wethington, 2012; Paloniemi & Tikka, 2008). Balancing 
effective policies and agricultural land use is a formidable challenge 
for conservation around the world (Tscharntke, Clough, et al., 2012), 
especially in areas where the majority of land is privately owned. For 
example, the commonwealth of Kentucky is 96.5% privately owned 
and approximately half of that is agricultural land. In spite of the 
challenges, private land conservation is urgently needed because 
agriculture has driven declines of imperiled species such as grass-
land birds (Donald, Green, & Heath, 2001; Murphy & Moore, 2003).
Private 
land 
conservation 
programmes 
such 
as 
agri-­
environmental schemes (AES) and the Conservation Reserve 
Program (CRP) are used throughout Europe and United States, re-
spectively, to mitigate farmland bird population declines. The CRP 
is a US Department of Agriculture programme administered by the 
Farm Service Agency that incentivizes landowners to temporarily 
remove agricultural land from production in lieu of an approved con-
servation practice. Similar to set-­aside programmes within AES, the 
CRP can be viewed as a form of land sparing (Fischer et al., 2008). 
Fields enrolled in grassland CRP practices are typically higher quality 
habitat for grassland birds than active agriculture (Best et al., 1998; 
Johnson & Schwartz, 1993). Although localized positive effects of 
CRP and similar conservation programmes are well documented (e.g. 
Buckingham, Evans, Morris, Orsman, & Yaxley, 1999; Halloum, Leo, 
& Heard, 2000), the effectiveness of private land conservation in 
reversing grassland bird declines is tied to landscape-­scale effects 
(Kleijn, Rundlöf, Scheper, Smith, & Tscharntke, 2011), that is, the 
geographic extent of conservation benefits beyond targeted land 
parcels. Landscape-­scale studies directly modelling the impacts of 
conservation on population growth are less common (but see Baker, 
Freeman, Grice, & Siriwardena, 2012; Riffell, Scognamillo, & Burger, 
2008; Veech, 2006). Conservation in agricultural landscapes should 
be designed to benefit multiple populations (or subpopulations or 
communities) simultaneously, yet there is little congruence in what 
constitutes a landscape for grassland birds (Osborne & Sparling, 
2013; Pabian, Wilson, & Brittingham, 2013; Riffell et al., 2015).
The mechanisms driving the spatial scale at which a species 
is most responsive to environmental change (the scale of effect) 
include a species’ traits (e.g. mobility), demography (e.g. reproduc-
tive rate) and landscape characteristics (e.g. matrix quality), and 
these mechanisms may vary regionally (Miguet, Jackson, Jackson, 
Martin, & Fahrig, 2016). Thus, determining the scale of effect of 
a conservation programme on wildlife is a necessary step to un-
derstanding population-­level response (Smith, Fahrig, & Francis, 
2011; Wiens, 1989). One way to determine scale of effect is to use 
the focal patch approach, in which independent variables within 
several nested landscapes are related to dependent variables mea-
sured at local sites (Brennan, Bender, Contreras, & Fahrig, 2002). 
This method reduces uncertainty about appropriate spatial scales 
but can produce spurious scale selection (Jackson & Fahrig, 2015), 
implicitly ignores theories of how populations and individuals in-
teract with landscapes such as optimal foraging theory (Charnov, 
1976) and metapopulation dynamics (Hanski & Gilpin, 1991) and 
ignores uncertainty about chosen scale of effect. An alternative 
approach is to estimate the scale of effect using smoothing kernels 
to acknowledge that the importance of a landscape feature should 
decline with distance to the focal site (Chandler & Hepinstall-­
Cymerman, 2016). Understanding the relationship between the 
importance of a resource patch and distance to a local population 
is critical to effective private land conservation over broad scales 
(Whittingham, 2007), and this relationship can directly inform 
conservation planning by defining species-­specific landscapes 
(Supporting information).
Just as population response to conservation varies across space, 
population performance in response to conservation measures will 
vary with time as intrinsic factors such as density-­dependence man-
ifest. Modelling population dynamics usually requires information 
on marked individuals (e.g. Pradel, 1996); however, spatially and 
temporally replicated counts can be sufficient to estimate popula-
tion growth rates (Dail & Madsen, 2011; Royle, 2004). Modelling 
growth allows us to use classical population models that do not as-
sume resources are unlimited (Hostetler & Chandler, 2015; Nadeem, 
Moore, Zhang, & Chipman, 2016). Realistic growth models facilitate 
population forecasting and allow us to compare the ramifications of 
alternative management scenarios. Understanding potential popu-
lation response to alternative conservation strategies is especially 
relevant to the CRP because landowner contracts are temporary and 
resource management agencies have finite political, monetary and 
logistical capital to dedicate to re-­enrolment efforts. Thus, we need 
biologically realistic models to understand the uncertainty surround-
ing the response of populations to differing re-­enrolment strategies.
diminishes with distance. Estimating this relationship and incorporating it into a 
decision framework could help practitioners target land enrolment to meet broad-
scale population objectives.

YEISER et al.
In agricultural landscapes, grassland bird populations are driven 
by resource availability (Butler, Boccaccio, Gregory, Vorisek, & 
Norris, 2010), specifically food and nesting resources (Benton, 
Bryant, Cole, & Crick, 2002; Butler, Vickery, & Norris, 2007). 
Assuming that increased amount of nesting habitat would result 
in increased net reproductive output (Sutherland, 1996), we would 
expect individual fitness and population growth to increase in re-
sponse to a grassland conservation programme (Matthiopoulos 
et al., 2015). Particularly, we would expect the population response 
to outweigh the conservation footprint (i.e. a 10% increase in high 
quality nesting habitat would result in more than a 10% population 
increase), especially if additional nesting habitat complements ex-
isting resources (Dunning, Danielson, & Pulliam, 1992). However, if 
nesting resources are not complementary to other resources, we 
may expect to see a nonlinear trend in abundance in our first year 
of sampling across the gradient of conservation land density as 
other resources become limiting. Alternatively, if nesting resources 
are not the main factor limiting a grassland-­associated species (e.g. 
Janke & Gates, 2013), implementing a grassland conservation pro-
gramme would merely supplement existing resources (Dunning 
et al., 1992) and would initiate a response proportional to conser-
vation footprint. Under any of these scenarios, density-­dependent 
processes may manifest over time as population density increases 
(Roseberry & Klimstra, 1984).
Our goal was to investigate the population-­level effects of im-
plementing a grassland conservation programme. We used the 
Kentucky Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) as 
a model conservation programme and Northern Bobwhite (Colinus 
virginianus, hereafter: bobwhite) as a model species. We chose bob-
white because the adoption of high efficiency “clean farming” has 
contributed to their exacerbated declines (reviewed in Hernández, 
Brennan, DeMaso, Sands, & Wester, 2013), and they are a socially 
and economically valuable game bird. The CREP is an offshoot of 
the CRP that allows eligible states to define specific conservation 
priorities. Practices implemented for the CREP are based on CRP 
practices, but landowner eligibility requirements are often more 
stringent. Our objectives were to (1) estimate the spatial scale at 
which bobwhite respond to private land conservation, (2) model the 
response of bobwhite population density and growth to increasing 
landscape-­scale CREP density, while holding local CREP density con-
stant, and (3) project populations under varying levels of CREP re-­
enrolment, concurrent with contract expiration dates, up to 25 years 
beyond the starting point of our study.
We had three competing hypotheses about how bobwhite pop-
ulations would respond to the CREP soon after programme imple-
mentation, and these hypotheses were based on the assumption that 
CREP was primarily providing nesting resources. We hypothesized 
that bobwhite would display (1) a positive response that outweighs 
conservation footprint and does not diminish along the CREP den-
sity gradient (resource complementation hypothesis) or (2) a positive 
response that outweighs conservation footprint yet diminishes as 
conservation land density reaches high densities (nesting resources 
only hypothesis) or (3) a positive response directly proportional to 
conservation footprint (nesting resource supplementation hypoth-
esis). We also hypothesized that population growth would display 
negative density dependence because bobwhite are thought to be 
regulated via a reduction in survival or recruitment (Errington, 1945; 
Roseberry & Klimstra, 1984).
2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS
We studied the influence of the CREP on bobwhite in the 
Green River Basin in south central Kentucky during 2010–2015 
(Supporting information). Annual high temperatures average 
20.5°C, with average highs in November–February, March–May, 
June–August and September–October of 10.3, 20.7, 31.1 and 
24.7°C respectively. Average annual precipitation is 126.2 cm. 
The Green River Basin is characterized by karst topography with 
elevation ranging from 91 to 365 m above sea level. The Kentucky 
CREP consisted of several conservation practices (Supporting 
information), although the majority were CP29 (Marginal 
Pastureland Wildlife Buffer, 71%) and CP22 (Riparian Buffer, 16%). 
Although CP29 is described as a buffer, whole fields were enrolled 
and planted in mostly short grass prairie mixes. The CP22 fields 
were primarily a row of planted hardwoods with extended buffers 
seeded in tallgrass prairie mixes. The majority of contracts were 
initiated in 2008; thus, our initial year of sampling (2010) was at 
least one growing season after most fields had been planted.
We used a stratified random sampling design (Supporting in-
formation). We assumed that a 3,000 m radius circle was an appro-
priate landscape scale to inform study design (Twedt, Wilson, & 
Keister, 2007); however, our statistical methods directly test this 
assumption. We randomly selected sampling points within each of 
five CREP density strata (Supporting information), and point selec-
tion was informed by a power analysis. Kentucky Department of 
Fish and Wildlife Resources biologists performed 5-­min distance 
sampling point counts at each site for 6 years during the month 
of June. Observers typically surveyed the same points each year; 
however, some points went unsampled in 2010. We truncated 
bobwhite detection distances to 450 m and aggregated detections 
by distance bands based on the recommendations of Buckland 
(2001).
We fit the data to an open-­population distance sampling model 
(Royle, Dawson, & Bates, 2004; Sollmann, Gardner, Chandler, 
Royle, & Sillett, 2015). These models have three main compo-
nents: (1) a model for initial abundance, (2) a model for abundance 
in subsequent years t = 2…T and (3) detection conditional on abun-
dance. We modelled initial abundance at each site xi using a nega-
tive binomial distribution, where expected abundance λ(xi) varied 
with linear and quadratic landscape-­scale CREP density. We al-
lowed initial abundance to vary with local CREP density, although 
our study design rendered relatively low variation in local CREP 
density:
log (λ(xi)) = α0 +α1CREP(xi)+α2s(CREP(xi),σCREP)+α3s(CREP(xi),σCREP)2

where α0 is the intercept, α1 is the effect of local CREP density, α2 
is the linear effect of landscape-­scale smoothed CREP density, α3 is 
the quadratic effect of landscape-­scale smoothed CREP density and 
r is an estimate of overdispersion in counts. We modelled abundance 
in subsequent years using a Poisson distribution, with expected den-
sity a product of abundance in the previous year and a population 
growth rate. We chose a Poisson distribution based on preliminary 
assessments of Bayesian p-­values. Our model combines elements of 
the Dail–Madsen model (Dail & Madsen, 2011) into one growth rate, 
γ. As N(xi,t) is tied to N(xi,t−1), estimating γ alone does not account 
for immigration following local extinction, which can superficially 
deflate detection probabilities and overestimate abundance. Thus, 
we modelled an immigration rate I separate from γ. Therefore, γ rep-
resents the results of survival, recruitment and emigration and I rep-
resents immigration, and together they represent overall population 
growth at site xi from year t − 1 to year t. We assumed γ and I to be 
constant among years, yet overall growth rate could vary based on 
density-­dependent processes:
where θ0 is intrinsic γ, θ1 is the strength of density dependence 
on γ, θ2 is the influence of site-­level CREP density on γ, θ3 is the 
influence of landscape-­scale smoothed CREP density on γ, ι0 is the 
intercept of immigration rate and ι1 is the effect of landscape-­scale 
smoothed CREP on immigration rate. For each year in our model, 
we used a half-­normal key function to estimate the probability of 
detecting a singing individual in each distance band, and observa-
tions were modelled using a multinomial distribution (Supporting 
information).
We smoothed landscape-­scale CREP by aggregating our input 
raster to cell sizes approximately equal to our sampling units (63 ha) 
and produced a distance-­weighted average of CREP density at each 
cell using the spatial smoother examined in Chandler and Hepinstall-­
Cymerman (2016):
where weights w(.) are determined by a Gaussian kernel:
where |xi − xj| is the Euclidean distance between coordinates of pixel 
i and pixel j, and σCREP is the estimated scale parameter that dictates 
the shape of the Gaussian kernel. The summation does not include 
the pixel of interest “i” because we are interested in the effect of 
the surrounding landscape on local abundance. We restricted the 
search area of the Gaussian kernel to a 10 km radius circle to reduce 
computational effort. We assumed a 10 km radius circle would easily 
encompass the maximum scale of effect for bobwhite.
We modelled data from 2010 to 2015 and forecasted popula-
tions for 20 additional years under six different scenarios: 100%, 
80%, 60%, 40%, 20% and 0% CREP re-­enrolment. For each scenario 
each year, we randomly selected a percentage of contracts set to 
expire and “re-­enrolled” them. We assumed detection in the years 
2016–2035 was a random draw from a normal distribution with 
mean and standard deviation informed by estimates from the years 
(2010–2015) with data. To quantify the probability that one scenario 
would result in higher densities than another, we calculated the inte-
gral of overlap between any two posterior distributions of estimated 
densities in 2035.
We ran each model scenario in a Bayesian framework using the 
Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm in JAGS (Plummer, 2003) with 
the r package rjags (Plummer, 2016). We discarded the adaptive 
phase and appropriate number of iterations for each scenario to re-
move the influence of starting values. We ensured model conver-
gence using Gelman–Rubin diagnostics and visual inspection of trace 
plots. Model code for rjags is included in the Supporting information.
3 | RESULTS
We sampled 231 points in 2010 and 247 points from 2011 to 2015. 
We detected 159, 182, 180, 195, 227 and 180 male singing bobwhite 
in 2010–2015 respectively. We estimated detection probabilities for 
the years 2010–2015 to be 0.35 (0.28–0.43, 95% BCI), 0.33 (0.29–
0.39), 0.33 (0.29–0.37), 0.31 (0.27–0.35), 0.33 (0.29–0.38), 0.30 
(0.25–0.34) respectively.
Bobwhite landscapes were delineated at c. 5,000 m radius cir-
cles. The importance of CREP density to a local bobwhite popula-
tion decreased with increasing distance (Figure 1). For example, the 
median weight of a pixel (i.e. a cell in the covariate raster) 3,000 m 
away from a local population was 88% lower than a pixel 1,000 m 
away.
There was a 99.3% probability of a positive effect of 
­landscape-­scale CREP density on initial bobwhite density 
(Figure 2). Bobwhite densities in the initial year of sampling 
ranged from 0.016 (0.009–0.025, 95% BCI) to 0.056 males/ha 
(0.006–0.162, 95% BCI) across the landscape-­scale CREP density 
gradient. The response of initial bobwhite density to the CREP was 
consistent with our “nesting habitat only” hypothesis. An increase 
from 0.0 to 0.1 landscape-­scale CREP density resulted in a 182% 
increase in bobwhite density. However, an increase from 0.1 to 0.2 
landscape-­scale CREP density resulted in only a 21% increase in 
bobwhite density (Figure 3).
There was a 95.2% probability that γ (the result of survival, re-
cruitment and emigration) was positively influenced by landscape-­
scale CREP density (Figure 2). There was a 89.6% probability that 
I (immigration) was positively influenced by landscape-­scale CREP 
density (Figure 2). We estimated that negative density depen-
dence on γ was c. 8% of the previous year’s abundance. Overall

population growth mirrored conservation footprint at low amounts 
of landscape-­scale CREP but outweighed conservation footprint at 
high amounts of landscape-­scale CREP (Figure 4). Densities in our 
final year of sampling (2015) ranged from 0.034 (0.024–0.046, 95% 
BCI) to 0.105 males/ha (0.063–0.159, 95% BCI).
We predicted that re-­enrolling 80%, 60%, 40%, 20% and 0% 
would result in mean densities 10%, 19%, 26%, 33% and 39% lower 
than if 100% of contracts were re-­enrolled respectively (Figure 5). 
Our forecasts indicated a 32%, 57%, 71%, 81% and 87% probabil-
ity that re-­enrolling 100% of CREP contracts would lead to higher 
densities in the year 2035 than 80%, 60%, 40%, 20% and 0% 
­re-­enrolment respectively.
4 | DISCUSSION
Agricultural landscapes—and thus resources added by farmland 
conservation programmes—are inherently patchy. Understanding 
whether benefits of conservation extend beyond local scales is par-
amount to assessing the population-­level success of farmland con-
servation programmes (Kleijn et al., 2011). We found evidence that 
(1) farmland conservation benefits population growth via landscape-­
scale effects, (2) landscape-­scale effects decrease with increasing 
distance to a local population, (3) density-­dependent growth moder-
ates population response and (4) long-­term success will be tied to 
re-­enrolment effort.
Translating local effects of farmland conservation programmes 
to scales meaningful to populations is a challenge to successful 
regional-­scale conservation. Donald and Evans (2006) noted that 
benefits of farmland conservation programmes could extend be-
yond local scales via metapopulation dynamics and mechanisms of 
island biogeography theory; however, evidence for landscape-­scale 
benefits to bird populations is sparse. Baker et al. (2012) demon-
strated how AES can have landscape-­scale positive effects on birds 
in England, but regional-­scale assessments of the CRP have not 
­explicitly considered the effects of increasing conservation land 
density in the surrounding landscape on population growth (Riffell 
et al., 2008; Veech, 2006). Our results demonstrate that the amount 
of conservation land in the surrounding landscape affects local 
population dynamics. This underscores the importance of the land-
scape-scale approach to farmland conservation (e.g. Merckx et al., 
2009).
The nonlinear relationship between bobwhite density and 
landscape-­scale CREP density in 2010 could reflect an ecological 
threshold. Increased amount of landscape-­scale CREP likely re-
sulted in increased landscape complexity (Fahrig, 2003). Benefits 
of landscape complexity include increased dispersal capabilities as 
a result of high connectivity and increased complementation of re-
sources as a result of land cover configuration (Concepción et al., 
2012). We would expect that in landscapes with high CREP density 
(complex landscapes), CREP fields would be closer to existing brood

density, which suggests that the resources provided to bobwhite by 
CREP fields do not reflect total habitat amount.
Alternatively, the nonlinear response of bobwhite abundance to 
increasing landscape-­scale CREP density in 2010 could reflect the 
composition, not configuration, of resources in landscapes. A major 
resource that limits bird populations in farm landscapes is nest-
ing cover (Benton et al., 2002; Butler et al., 2007). Fields planted 
in warm season grasses and forbs (e.g. CREP fields) provide ample

nesting sites for bobwhite (Washburn, Barnes, & Sole, 2000), but 
unless frequently and appropriately disturbed, openness at ground 
level and quality of brood rearing cover diminishes (e.g. Yeiser, 
Baxley, Robinson, & Morgan, 2015). Additionally, it was unlikely that 
the CREP provided thermal or escape cover in 2010 because land-
owners planted woody cover infrequently. If we assume that bob-
white populations are indeed limited by resources that they require 
but are not readily available (Taylor, 1934), the nonlinear trend in 
2010 could reflect other resources-­limiting populations after nest-
ing resources are sufficiently dense. Thresholds are typically dis-
cussed in terms of total habitat amount (e.g. Swift & Hannon, 2010), 
but the management of wildlife populations may benefit from esti-
mating inflection points in the profile of resources that are limiting 
population growth.
The regulation of population growth by population density in 
bobwhite during our study was consistent with the idea that den-
sity dependence is an elemental feature of population dynamics 
(Brook & Bradshaw, 2006). Carrying capacity is influenced by the 
availability of resources and the use of those resources by individ-
uals within the population, intra-­ and interspecific competition and 
predators (del Monte-­Luna, Brook, Zetina-­Rejón, & Cruz-­Escalona, 
2004). Similar to Baker et al. (2012), we demonstrated that by in-
creasing a limiting resource (nesting cover), we can increase the 
carrying capacity of landscapes. Our results also suggest that 
increasing carrying capacity further may require conservation 
programmes to provide a variety of resources to the species or 
taxa of interest, which underscores the importance of a functional 
approach to private land conservation. Inventory of existing re-
sources via remote sensing, evaluation of freely available land 
cover data (e.g. National Land Cover Database) and expert opinion 
could facilitate an understanding of the functional quality of land-
scapes (Fahrig et al., 2011) and inform future private land conser-
vation priorities.
Recent literature advocates for goal-­oriented, spatially targeted 
farmland conservation (e.g. Batáry, Dicks, Kleijn, & Sutherland, 
2015; Díaz & Concepción, 2016; Whittingham, 2007). Spatially 
targeted conservation intended to optimize biodiversity, species 
abundance or species occurrence requires an understanding of 
landscape context because landscape factors influence population 
structure and dynamics (Tscharntke, Tylianakis, et al., 2012). An 
implicit assumption of spatial targeting, then, is that we know the 
appropriate landscape scale. Landscapes are species-­specific con-
cepts (Jackson & Fahrig, 2012), and the likelihood that a population 
will utilize resources added by farmland conservation will be mod-
erated by its distance to those resources (Whittingham, 2007), with 
the assumption being that resources closer to the focal population 
are more likely to be utilized (Charnov, 1976; Hanski & Gilpin, 1991). 
Consequently, understanding species-­specific forms of the relation-
ship between increasing distance and the utility of resources would 
facilitate spatially targeted conservation. The kernel smoother we 
used is tractable and can be implemented in many modelling scenar-
ios (Chandler & Hepinstall-­Cymerman, 2016); thus, when empirical 
data are available, it is a powerful framework for spatial optimization. 
However, if empirical data are unavailable during conservation plan-
ning, we recommend using potential mechanisms of species-­specific 
scales of effect (e.g. Miguet et al., 2016) to hypothesize appropriate 
landscape boundaries and to predict the shape of the relationship 
between resource utility and increasing distance (e.g. half-­normal or 
negative exponential). Subsequent monitoring and modelling similar 
to what we present herein could be used to establish an adaptive 
management framework that continually informs planning decisions.
The enrolment strategy of the CREP was to simply implement 
40,468 ha of conservation land. There was no consideration of 
landscape structure or ecological connectivity. Is this opportunistic 
approach a viable private land conservation strategy? The National 
Bobwhite Conservation Initiative (NBCI) established density goals 
for Kentucky of 0.25 bobwhite/ha in the non-­breeding season 
in pasture-­dominated landscapes (National Bobwhite Technical 
Committee, 2011). If we use our last year of data (2015), assume all 
singing males paired with a female, singing males represented the 
entire breeding male population and use a conservative estimate of 
overwinter survival (0.40), non-­breeding season densities in 2014 
ranged from 0.17 (0.12–0.24, 95% BCI) to 0.48 (0.34–0.67, 95% BCI) 
across the landscape-­scale CREP gradient. The landscape would 
need to have at least 5% (1%–10%, 95% BCI) CREP cover to produce 
0.25 bobwhite/ha. Conservatively, we recommend practitioners 
aim for 10% grassland land cover in the landscape surrounding focal 
sites to reach this goal. These percent cover recommendations are 
weighted by distance. Evaluating the amount of grassland land cover 
in any given landscape will require accounting for its configuration, 
specifically distances between grassland fields and the focal site.
Our forecasts indicate that the ultimate factor dictating long-­
term success of the CREP in Kentucky will be re-­enrolment effort. 
By presenting forecasted outcomes of alternative management 
scenarios, we have provided resource management agencies with 
information that could aid prioritization of re-­enrolment of CREP

in Kentucky. First, prioritization should be rooted in conservation 
outcomes, for example, meeting or maintaining NBCI density goals 
for bobwhite. Managing landscapes for bobwhite may be the most 
practical way to conserve grassland bird biodiversity in the Eastern 
US, as bobwhite can be an umbrella species for other grassland and 
shrubland birds (Crosby, Elmore, Leslie, & Will, 2015) and their im-
portance to sportsmen and women often drive farmland conserva-
tion policy (e.g. Conservation Practice 33). Second, agencies could 
use our forecasts to understand opportunity costs of different man-
agement decisions. For example, is the increased cost of re-­enrolling 
100% of contracts vs. 80% of contracts worth the potential gain 
in bobwhite density, given that there is only a 32% probability of 
obtaining greater densities? Finally, spatial prioritization could be 
guided by the estimated relationship between increasing distance 
and utility of CREP fields to local populations. Simulations quanti-
fying the potential differences in carrying capacities resulting from 
random, opportunistic and spatially targeted re-­enrolment at some 
percentage (e.g. 80%) are necessary to fully inform these decisions, 
and we believe our modelling framework is a first step in that pro-
cess. The development of user-­friendly, data-­driven decision sup-
port tools that allow spatially explicit value inputs such as population 
goals, monetary and logistical resources, and landowner interest 
would facilitate the transfer of research findings and policy objec-
tives to on-­the-­ground conservation.
Our study is an example of how outcome-­based monitoring con-
tributes to strategic habitat conservation and provides guidance 
on the practical considerations of employing a landscape-­scale ap-
proach to farmland conservation. Specifically, we expect our find-
ings to have implications for planning and implementation of CRP 
and CREP in the U.S. and similar voluntary set-­aside practices across 
Europe. We believe the advancement of knowledge on (1) how and 
why landscape scales vary among and within species, (2) functional 
relationships between population growth and land cover compo-
sition and landscape context and (3) repercussions of spatially tar-
geted land enrolment vs. random or opportunistic enrolment would 
improve the efficiency of farmland conservation.
