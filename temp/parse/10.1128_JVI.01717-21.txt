ABSTRACT
A 2-year surveillance study of inﬂuenza A viruses in migratory birds was
conducted to understand the subsequent risk during the migratory seasons in
Dandong Yalu River Estuary Coastal Wetland National Nature Reserve, Liaoning
Province, China, a major stopover site on the East Asian-Australasian ﬂyway. Overall,
we isolated 27 inﬂuenza A viruses with multiple subtypes, including H3N8 (n = 2),
H4N6 (n = 2), H4N7 (n = 2), H7N4 (n = 9), H7N7 (n = 1), H10N7 (n = 7), and H13N6
(n = 4). Particularly, a novel reassortant inﬂuenza A(H7N4) virus was ﬁrst identiﬁed in
a woman and her backyard poultry ﬂock in Jiangsu Province, China, posing a serious
threat to public health. Here, we describe the genetic characterization and pathoge-
nicity of the nine inﬂuenza A(H7N4) isolates. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that
complex viral gene ﬂow occurred among Asian countries. We also demonstrated a
similar evolutionary trajectory of the surface genes of the A(H7N4) isolates and
Jiangsu human-related A(H7N4) viruses. Our A(H7N4) isolates exhibited differing
degrees of virulence in mice, suggesting a potential risk to other mammalian spe-
cies, including humans. We revealed multiple mutations that might affect viral viru-
lence in mice. Our report highlights the importance and need for the long-term sur-
veillance of avian inﬂuenza virus in migratory birds combined with domestic poultry
surveillance along migratory routes and ﬂyways and, thereby, the development of
measures to manage potential health threats.
IMPORTANCE The H7 subtype avian inﬂuenza viruses, such as H7N2, H7N3, H7N4,
H7N7, and H7N9, were documented as being capable of infecting humans, and
the H7 subtype low pathogenicity avian inﬂuenza viruses are capable of mutating
into highly pathogenic avian inﬂuenza; therefore, they pose a serious threat to
public health. Here, we investigated the evolutionary history, molecular character-
istics, and pathogenicity of shorebird-origin inﬂuenza A(H7N4) viruses, showing a
similar evolutionary trajectory with Jiangsu human A(H7N4) viruses in HA and NA
genes. Moreover, our isolates exhibited variable virulence (including moderate vir-
ulence) in mice, suggesting a potential risk to other mammalian species, including
humans.

S
imilar to the H5 low-pathogenicity avian inﬂuenza viruses (LPAIVs), the H7 LPAIVs
are capable of mutating into highly pathogenic avian inﬂuenza (HPAI) variants that
can cause high fatality in poultry and pose a serious threat to public health (1). Since
the ﬁrst human infection with a novel H7N9 subtype avian inﬂuenza virus (AIV) in
China in the spring of 2013, a total of 1,568 laboratory-conﬁrmed human cases (case
fatality rate of 615/1,568, i.e., 39%) have been reported (2). Furthermore, H7N9 HPAI
variants emerged in late 2016 and circulated in poultry and humans during the ﬁfth
epidemic wave (3). H7N8 and H7N9 HPAI variants were also found in poultry in North
America in 2016 and 2017, respectively (4, 5). In summary, the virulence and molecular
evolution of inﬂuenza A(H7N4) viruses are of great concern to avian and human
health.
A novel reassortant A(H7N4) virus was ﬁrst identiﬁed in a woman and her backyard
poultry ﬂock in Jiangsu Province, China, in January 2018 (6). Previous studies have
shown that partial genes of the human infection-related A(H7N4) viruses were most
likely transferred from wild waterfowl to the poultry AIV gene pool (7). Active surveil-
lance of AIVs in migratory birds was undertaken to investigate whether wild birds carry
the similar A(H7N4) virus. Consequently, nine H7N4 AIVs were isolated from seabirds in
the Dandong Yalu River Estuary Coastal Wetland National Nature Reserve, Liaoning
Province; this area is a major stopover site for migratory waterfowl waves on the East
Asian-Australasian ﬂyway during migratory seasons.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Overall, 4,455 samples from shorebirds were collected during the bird migratory
season of 2018 to 2019, 27 viruses were isolated, and the total prevalence of AIVs
was 0.61%. Viral isolates consisted of multiple subtype combinations, including
H3N8 (n = 2), H4N6 (n = 2), H4N7 (n = 2), H7N4 (n = 9), H7N7 (n = 1), H10N7 (n = 7),
and H13N6 (n = 4) (Table 1). Here, we selected the A(H7N4) viruses isolated in April
2019, which showed a close genetic relationship with the Jiangsu human-related A
(H7N4) virus (Js/H7N4), for genetic characterization as part of this investigation
(Table 2).
The whole genomes of Liaoning A(H7N4) (Ln/H7N4) isolates were sequenced and
compared with each other. Most gene segments among Ln/H7N4 isolates shared a rel-
atively high nucleotide identity (99.7 to 100%), except for the polymerase acidic (PA),
nucleoprotein (NP), and nonstructural (NS) genes, which showed 93.6 to 100%, 93.5 to
100%, and 96.4 to 100% nucleotide identity, respectively. As such, the nine isolates
were grouped into four genotypes as follows: genotype 1 [A/shorebird/Liaoning/dan-
dong603/2019(H7N4) (abbreviated as D603)-like, including six isolates], genotype 2
[isolate A/eastern curlew/Liaoning/dandong688/2019(H7N4) (abbreviated as D688)],
genotype 3 [isolate A/eastern curlew/Liaoning/dandong1144/2019(H7N4) (abbreviated
as D1144)], and genotype 4 [isolate A/little curlew/Liaoning/dandong142/2019(H7N4)
(abbreviated as D142)].
In the overall genetic structure of the global H7 hemagglutinin (HA) tree, two major
geographically dependent genetic lineages, American and Eurasian, were represented.
Ln/H7N4 and Js/H7N4 were clustered into the Eurasian lineage; however, they were
not genetically related to the enzootic A(H7N9) viruses in China (Fig. 1). The maximum-
likelihood phylogenetic inference by the IQ-TREE suggested a similar evolutionary tra-
jectory of the surface genes of Ln/H7N4 and Js/H7N4 (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental
material). These results indicate that the HA and neuraminidase (NA) genes of wild
waterfowl inﬂuenza viruses in China may show common ancestors with Js/H7N4. The
six internal genes of A(H7N4) viruses were diverse and clustered into separate lineages,
although they mainly clustered with viruses circulating both in wild waterfowl and
domestic poultry in the East Asian-Australasian ﬂyway predominantly in Eastern China,
Mongolia, Korea, Japan, Cambodia, and Bangladesh (Fig. S1). For Js/H7N4, besides the
HA, NA, and PA gene segments, which showed a close relationship with those of A
(H7N4) viruses circulating in ducks in Cambodia, the remaining inner gene segments

(polymerase basic 1 [PB1], NP, matrix [M], and NS) were clustered together with wild-
origin LPAIVs. Compared to the Js/H7N4 that showed common ancestors in all gene
segments, Ln/H7N4 showed more diversity in the PA, NP, and NS genes, suggesting
that these viruses had undergone multiple reassortment events in viruses circulating in
the natural reservoir (Fig. 2; see also Fig. S1). As such, genetic diversity in inner gene
segments of the H7N4 virus from shorebird might reﬂect the breadth of sources from
which the AIVs were derived. Our study provided further evidence that highly preva-
lent reassortment occurred in nature.
The timing of evolution events was determined by Bayesian phylogenetic recon-
struction and demonstrated by maximum clade credibility trees (Fig. 3). The time to
the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of the HA and NA genes of Ln/H7N4 was
most likely February 2018 and January 2019, respectively, which is later than that of
Js/H7N4, which appeared in December 2016 and July 2017, respectively (Fig. 2;
Table 3). The tMRCA of the internal genes revealed that the generation of Ln/H7N4
has been a complex process from 2017 to 2019 and was likely completed in
February 2019. Reassortment of Js/H7N4 occurred mainly during July to October
2017 (Fig. 2; Table 3).
Using phylogeographic analysis, we sought to understand further the most likely
source of A(H7N4) viruses. Potential events of cross-regional gene ﬂow to the origin of
A(H7N4) viruses were identiﬁed (Fig. 3). For Ln/H7N4, dispersal events from East Asia
were observed for polymerase basic 2 (PB2), PA, HA, matrix protein (M), and nonstruc-
tural protein (NS) gene; dispersal events from Southeast Asia were detected for PB1,
NP, and NA gene. However, intercontinental introductions from Europe were observed
in the NS gene of D142, with a low posterior probability of 0.3906. Evidence for gene
ﬂow in PB1 and NS genes occurred from Eastern China [A/wildbird/Eastern China/
1754/2017(H5N3)-like] to Jiangsu. Viruses in East Asia (PB2, NP, and M) and Southeast
Asia (PA, H7, and N4) also contributed to the generation of Js/H7N4. The results indi-
cated that complex viral gene ﬂow occurred among Asian countries. Overlapping of
the migration ﬂyway, East Asian-Australasian ﬂyway, might have resulted in this cross-
regional dispersal.

The amino acid sequence PELPKGR;GLFGAI was found within the cleavage site of
the HA of Ln/H7N4, suggesting that all were LPAIVs (Table 4). The receptor binding
sites were avian-like in 226Q and 228G (H3 numbering) (8). The E627K substitution was
observed in the PB2 protein of A/Jiangsu/1/2018; however, the mutation residues
Q591, E627, and D701 in the PB2 protein of Ln/H7N4 and Jiangsu poultry A(H7N4)
viruses suggest that these viruses have not yet adapted to mammalian hosts (Table 4)
(9, 10). Both Ln/H7N4 and Js/H7N4 carried an avian C-terminal ESEV motif in the NS1
protein, which has been shown to increase viral virulence in mice (Table 4) (11).
In the SeqLogo analysis (see Table S1 in the supplemental material), Ln/H7N4, espe-
cially D1144 and D142, displayed polymorphic amino acid sites in PB2 (n = 2), PA
(n = 3), PA-X (n = 6), NP (n = 5), NA (n = 1), M1 (n = 1), NS1 (n = 4), and NS2 (n = 2).
D688 also showed high polymorphic amino acid sites, however, with no single unique

site. Virus evolution is characterized by adaptations that are speciﬁc to the host.
Genetic analysis has shown that Ln/H7N4 and Js/H7N4 shared a common ancestor in
HA and NA gene segments; therefore, we next compared their amino acid sequences
(Fig. 4; see also Table S1). In particular, A/Jiangsu/1/2018(H7N4) presented three
unique amino acids (242Q and 479M in HA and 137V in NA). Five amino acids changed
gradually from shorebird to poultry (V7L, D283N, and E321K in HA and I10L and I262L
in NA), revealing a potential host adaptation process.
Three viruses were selected and tested by experimental infection of mice to investi-
gate the virulence of the shorebird-origin H7N4 isolates in mammals. Viral titers in
organs of D603-infected mice were markedly low (Fig. 5), and all mice survived until
14 days postinfection (dpi) without signiﬁcant weight loss (Fig. 6 and 7); thus, D603
showed nonpathogenic in mice. In contrast, virus titration showed that D1144 could rep-
licate suitably in the infected mice's lungs (Fig. 5). Furthermore, D1144-infected mice
died by day 9 when inoculated with 106 50% egg infective doses (EID50) (Fig. 6). The 50%
minimum lethal dose (MLD50) of D1144 was 5.43 EID50; thus, D1144 exhibits moderate
virulence in mice without prior adaption. D142 could be detected in the infected mice's
lungs, nasal turbinate, and kidneys (Fig. 5). All D142-infected mice survived until 14 dpi
(Fig. 6), although these mice's bodyweight showed a transient decrease from day 4
when inoculated with 105 to 106 EID50 and then returned to normal growth by day 12
(Fig. 7). Thus, D142 showed mild virulence in mice. The three viruses exhibited differing
degrees of virulence in mice, suggesting a potential risk to other mammalian species,
including humans. At the genome level, D1144 and D142 shared similar sources except
for the NS gene of D142, which came from Europe. Here, we identiﬁed multiple muta-
tions in NS1 (H63Q, C116Y, I129T, and L141V) and NS2 (G27D and V89I), compared to
two additional mutations in PB2 (P117T) and NP (V67I) (Fig. 8; see also Table S1). The
NS1 protein performs multiple functions that affect AIV replication and virulence (12).
Very few NS2 mutations that affect viral ﬁtness and host adaptation are characterized in
AIVs. Furthermore, the effect of these mutations on AIV pathogenicity is either negligible
or unclear (13). Mutations in PB2 and NP affecting viral virulence have also been con-
ﬁrmed. Thus, mutations H63Q, C116Y, I129T, and L141V in NS1, with P117T in PB2 and
V67I in NP might affect viral virulence in mice. These sites potentially affect the biological
properties of the virus, but further investigation will be needed. Compared to nonpatho-
genic strain D603, D1144 only displays one C116Y mutation in NS1; however, multiple
mutations were found in other proteins, and experimental veriﬁcation is required to vali-
date the phenotype of the C116Y mutation NS1.

Live poultry markets have played pivotal roles in the genesis of novel AIVs. In the
spring of 2013, a novel A(H7N9) virus emerged in China and infected people exposed
to live-bird markets. Phylogenic analysis indicated that the virus emerged through mul-
tiple reassortment events in wild birds and obtained internal genes from H9N2 viruses
circulating in poultry. H7N9 AIVs were primarily isolated from poultry while occasion-
ally detected in forest bird species. One reasonable explanation for the notable spread
of the A(H7N9) virus only in poultry and its geographical limitation to China is that it
could not replicate in the waterfowl host, thereby losing the opportunity to infect the
migratory birds distributed broadly (14). In this study, we describe the isolation of the
A(H7N4) virus from shorebird and their moderate pathogenicity in mice without previ-
ous adaption, indicating that these isolates could be a potential threat to the public.
Similar A(H7N4) viruses were also detected in Cambodia (15), which provided HA, NA,
and PA for the emergence of Js/H7N4. Migratory birds carrying AIVs can travel over
long distances. H7N4 subtype LPAIVs also have the possibility of mutating into highly
pathogenic strains during transmission or acquire internal genes from A(H9N2) viruses.
Given the continual circulation of AIVs in wild birds and domestic poultry, the potential
for human spillover, the innate capacity for reassortment of AIVs, and the constant an-
tigenic variation, it is paramount to understand the potential risk of any emerging AIV.
Therefore, long-term surveillance of AIVs in migratory birds, combined with domestic

poultry surveillance along migratory routes and ﬂyways, should be performed to facili-
tate early characterization of H7 subtype AIVs and other AIVs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sampling, virus isolation, and sequencing. After the ﬁrst case of human infection with the A
(H7N4) virus was conﬁrmed in January 2018, to trace whether wild birds carry the A(H7N4) virus, active
surveillance of AIV was undertaken during the bird migratory seasons of 2018 to 2019 in the Dandong
Yalu River Estuary Coastal Wetland National Nature Reserve, Liaoning Province, China. The samples were
oscillated and then centrifuged, and the collected supernatant of all samples was inoculated into 9-day-
old speciﬁc-pathogen-free (SPF) chicken embryos. Then, 72 h after incubation, the allantoic ﬂuid was
harvested, and the hemagglutinin (HA) activity was assayed. The negative allantoic ﬂuid was passaged
twice again in embryonated eggs. An HA inhibition assay was performed preliminarily to determine the
HA subtype of the isolated virus by using chicken anti-HA serum for each subtype. Viral RNA was
extracted from HA-positive samples from the incubated allantoic ﬂuid using a QIAamp Viral RNA minikit
(Qiagen, Germany) and reverse transcribed using the primer Uni12. Viral cDNAs were ampliﬁed by PCR
with primers designed for each gene segment (16). The PCR products of eight fragments of the isolates
were sequenced using Sanger sequencing. The sequence data were compiled using the SeqMan pro-
gram (DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA). The AIV-positive samples’ hosts were identiﬁed by amplifying cyto-
chrome b sequences as described previously (17). The whole-genome sequences were submitted to the
Global Initiative on Sharing All Inﬂuenza Data (GISAID) (https://www.gisaid.org/) EpiFlu database (acces-
sion numbers EPI_ISL_445001 to EPI_ISL_445093).
Genetic analysis. The variation of amino acid sequences among our Liaoning A(H7N4) isolates
(abbreviated as Ln/H7N4) and Jiangsu human-related A(H7N4) viruses (abbreviated as Js/H7N4) were
visualized by SeqLogo implemented in TBtools to analyze the potential host adaptation molecular char-
acters (18). The sequence logo consists of stacks of symbols for corresponding amino acids. To assess
the overall genetic structure of the H7 HA sequences, we downloaded global H7 HA sequences from
GISAID. Next, for each gene, Ln/H7N4 and Js/H7N4, together with their top 50 hits in GISAID, were com-
bined into a data set. Sequences were aligned using MAFFT (19) implemented in PhyloSuite 1.21 (20).
Duplicated sequences and low-quality sequences were removed. These data sets were further used to
infer phylogenies and perform Bayesian analysis. A phylogenetic tree was reconstructed by maximum
likelihood (ML) in IQ-TREE (21) under the best-ﬁt substitution model for 10,000 ultrafast bootstraps (22).
The best-ﬁt substitution model was selected using the Bayesian information criterion by ModelFinder
(23) implemented in PhyloSuite 1.21 (20). Visualization and annotation of the trees were performed by
EvolView (https://www.evolgenius.info/evolview-v2).
Phylogeography analyses. Before the analysis, the temporal signal of each data set was investi-
gated using a root-to-tip regression of genetic distances against sampling time in the program TempEst
v1.5 (24). To clarify the contribution of AIVs in different geographical regions to Ln/H7N4 and Js/H7N4,
we performed a phylogeographic analysis using an asymmetric model with a Bayesian stochastic search
variable selection implemented in BEAST v1.10.4 (25). The sequences in each data set were divided into
multiple geographical regions: Liaoning (Ln/H7N4), Jiangsu (Js/H7N4), China (other Provinces or other

subtypes AIVs in China), East Asia, Southeast Asia, Europe, and other region. The best-ﬁt substitution
model was selected as described above. We computed the marginal likelihoods using path sampling
and stepping-stone sampling (26) to select the best combination of clock model (strict clock and uncor-
related lognormal relaxed clock) and tree priors (constant size, exponential growth, and Bayesian sky-
line). Two Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) runs with 80,000,000 states sampling every 8,000 steps
were performed, and results were combined by LogCombiner v1.10.4 (http://beast.community/
logcombiner). Tracer v1.7.1 (http://beast.community/tracer) was used for obtaining an adequate sample
size of $200. Maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees were combined after removing initial 10% burn-in
and then reconstructed using TreeAnnotator v1.10.4 (http://beast.community/treeannotator). MCC trees
were edited by FigTree v1.4.3 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/ﬁgtree). The time to the most common
ancestor was also estimated from the MCC trees. All BEAST runs were run on the cyberinfrastructure for
phylogenetic research (CIPRES) science gateway (https://www.phylo.org).

10-fold serial dilutions 106 to 101 50% egg infectious doses (EID50) of A(H7N4) viruses in a volume of 50 ml. A
control group (n = 5) was intranasally inoculated with 50 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The mice
were monitored for 14 days to assess mortality. The MLD50 was determined using the Reed-Muench method
(28). Three mice were anesthetized with CO2 and instilled intranasally with 106 EID50 of the virus in a volume
of 50 ml to detect the infectivity of A(H7N4) viruses. Three mice were euthanized at 3 days postinfection
(dpi), and different tissues, including the brain, spleen, kidney, lungs, and nasal turbinate were collected. The
tissue samples were homogenized and centrifuged at 8,000 rpm. Then, the supernatants were collected and
inoculated into three 9-day-old eggs. At 72 h after incubation and 37°C, the activity of HA was tested, and
the EID50 was determined using the Reed-Muench method (28). Statistical analysis was performed by applica-
tion of Student's t test using GraphPad Prism version 8.0 software; P , 0.05 was considered as signiﬁcant.
The error bars represent the standard deviation (SD).
