The
modular
syntheses
of
C3-symmetric
tris(ferrocenyl)arene-based
tris-phosphanes
and
their
homotrinuclear gold(I) complexes are reported. Choosing the arene core allows ﬁne-tuning of the exact
oxidation potentials and thus tailoring of the electrochemical response. The tris[chloridogold(I)]
complexes were investigated in the catalytic ring-closing isomerisation of N-(2-propyn-1-yl)benzamide,
showing cooperative behaviour vs. a mononuclear chloridogold(I) complex. Adding one, two, or three
equivalents of 1,10-diacetylferrocenium[tetrakis(perﬂuoro-tert-butoxy)aluminate] as an oxidant during the
catalytic reaction (in situ) resulted in a distinct, stepwise inﬂuence on the resulting catalytic rates.
Isolation of the oxidised species is possible, and using them as (pre-)catalysts (ex situ oxidation)
conﬁrmed the activity trend. Proving the intactness of the P–Au–Cl motif during oxidation, the tri-
oxidised benzene-based complex has been structurally characterised.
Introduction
Attaining control over catalytic reactions by external stimuli,
preferably with as tight a grip as demonstrated in Nature's
complex regulation pathways, has long been at the centre of
interest for the chemical community.1–3 It has been 25 years
since the seminal work by the groups of Wrighton and Rebek,
the
former
demonstrating
a
cobaltocene-based
rhodium
complex A (Chart 1) to function as either a good hydrogenation
(CoII) or hydrosilylation (CoIII) catalyst, the activity for the cor-
responding reaction being signicantly lower in the respective
other oxidation state.4 Rebek and co-workers used light to
reversibly isomerise an azobenzene-derived organo-catalyst B
and thus tuning it towards an amide-forming reaction.5 A vast
body of work concerning articially switchable catalysis has
since been assembled,6–9 with a major focus on redox-
switchable catalysis (RSC).10–13 Even though switching between
oxidation states is usually achieved through the addition of
chemical redox agents, RSC holds great potential for applica-
tions using electrodes and thus greatly reducing chemical
waste.14–18 Conceptually, both ligand and metal can form the
centres of (reversible) electron transfer for changing the activity
state of the catalyst.11 For ligand-based switching, ferrocene has
proven and remains a cornerstone for ligand design owing to its
amenability to synthetic modication and favourable, while
modiable, redox properties.19,20
Even though one of the rst redox-switchable catalysts by
Long and co-workers used for the ring-opening polymerisa-
tion of rac-lactide, C (Chart 1),21 already contained two
pendant ferrocenyl groups, and a plethora of compounds
featuring multiple ferrocenyl groups is available,22–28 only one
report by Zhao and Chen deals with exploiting the possibility
of addressing more than just two catalytic states. Employing
an a-diimine palladium catalyst D with two pendant ferro-
cenyl groups, the three activity states resulting from sequen-
tial two-step oxidation were found to diﬀer with respect to
polymerisation
activity,
resulting
in
tuneable
polymer
molecular weight, topology, and polydispersity.29 The scarcity
of this concept in RSC is surprising given how multi-state
switchable
molecules
feature
prominently
in
molecular
machines30–33
and
molecular
electronics
and
logic.34–41
Combining molecular machines and catalysis, Wang and
Feringa have impressively demonstrated a unidirectionally
light- and thermo-switchable rotor F to display three diﬀerent
activity states in an organo-catalysed asymmetric Michael
addition, in turn also leading to diﬀerent enantioselectivities
(P,P-trans: racemic; M,M-cis: S enantiomer; M,M-trans: R
enantiomer).42
Expanding on this idea, we sought to prepare a system with
four accessible oxidation states by making use of the C3-
symmetric s-tris(ferrocenyl)arene motif recently rst exploited
for ligand design.43 So far, we have focused on the monotopic
use of these tris-phosphanes 1 (Scheme 1); however, put to use

Results and discussion
Preparation and electrochemical characterisation of tris-
phosphanes and trinuclear gold(I) complexes
The preparation of tris-phosphanes 1 (Scheme 1, top), as
described for 1c,43 starts with a triple Negishi coupling of the in
situ-generated 1-bromo-10-ferrocenylene zinc halide 2, prepared
from 1,10-dibromoferrocene,61 n-butyllithium and anhydrous
zinc chloride in THF,25,62 with C3-symmetric arenes 3a–e.
Introducing electron-withdrawing (b, c) and electron-donating
(e) arenes as well as a tris-benzylic arene core (d), preventing
conjugation between the three ferrocenylene groups, allows for
modularly ne-tuning the system's electrochemical response
(vide infra). Tris(1-bromo-10-ferrocenylene)arenes 4a–e are ob-
tained in moderate to good yields as crystalline solids and the
potential to incorporate more and highly functionalised cores is
only limited by the functional group tolerance of the Negishi
protocol.63 4a, b, d, e were analysed by single crystal X-ray
diﬀraction (XRD) analysis (Fig. S1 and Table S3†), their struc-
tural parameters falling within the expected standard ranges for
C3-symmetric tris(ferrocenyl)arenes.25,64–68 In solution, 4a–e are
characterised by unhindered rotation about the Carene–CCp
bonds on the NMR timescale, thus displaying C3v symmetry in
their 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra.
Depending on the choice of PdII precatalyst, formation of bi-
and triferrocenes has also been observed. Among them, tri-
ferrocene SP1 (Scheme 1, bottom) had not been crystallo-
graphically characterised until now69 and is most likely formed
from hindered reductive elimination followed by a second
transmetallation step of 2 onto the Pd catalyst.70 The formation
of pentanuclear SP2 during the preparation of 4e can be simi-
larly rationalised. Together with the isolation of only di-
ferrocenylated
bromotriuorobenzene
SP3,
these
ndings
point towards the use of our synthetic protocol to access ever
more complex and functionalisable redox-active structures.
Tris-phosphanes 1a–d are obtained following the established
protocol and puried by column chromatography.43 Attempting
the synthesis of a mesitylene-based tris-phosphane from 4e has
only resulted in the isolation of impure trace amounts, poten-
tially due to side reactions involving the methyl protons of 4e.
Crystals suitable for XRD analysis have been obtained for 1a and
1d (Fig. 1 and S4†). Their structural parameters are in agree-
ment with those previously reported for 1c43 and other diphe-
nylphosphanyl ferrocenes.71–74 Similar to their precursors 4, no
rotamers are observed in solution, while small changes in the
31P{1H} NMR chemical shis of 1a–d reect the electronic
nature of the arene core (Table 1).
Borane adducts [1a–c(BH3)3] have been prepared ([1c(BH3)3]
has been reported before)43 to study the electrochemistry of the
phosphanes (vide infra), since direct cyclopentadienyl–phos-
phorus bonds usually render the oxidations irreversible due to
the lone pair of electrons on phosphorus.75–77 Adduct [1a(BH3)3]
was found to crystallise with crystallographic C3 symmetry
(space group R3, Fig. 1) and compares well (Table S5†) to
structural parameters of similar ferrocenyl-phosphane boranes
described by us78 as well as by ˇStˇepniˇcka and co-workers.79
Recently we reported the capability of 1c to bind coinage
metal ions in a tridentate trigonal planar coordination mode;43
now we have turned our focus to potential trinuclear gold(I)
complexes of 1a–c. Indeed, reacting the tris-phosphanes with
the common gold(I) precursor [AuCl(tht)] (tht ¼ tetrahy-
drothiophene) in slight stoichiometric excess aﬀorded, aer
simple precipitation, homotrinuclear metal complexes [1a–
c(Au)3]
in
good
yields.
Their
trinuclear
composition
is
conrmed by CHN analyses, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy,
and they remain homotrinuclear in the gas phase as assessed by
high-resolution electrospray-ionisation mass spectrometry (HR-
ESI MS).
Representative for all three gold(I) chloride complexes, the
molecular structure of [1c(Au)3] was determined from suitable
crystals (Fig. 2) and conrms the trinuclearity in the solid state
as well. In line with the experimentally determined non-
centrosymmetric space group P1, [1c(Au)3] crystallises as an
enantiopure compound (xFlack ¼ 0.008(7)); however, in solu-
tion, there is no indication of a corresponding hindered rota-
tion as assessed from NMR spectroscopy.

The P–Au bond lengths (2.225(5)–2.231(6) ˚A, Tables 2 and
S6†) are similar to mononuclear analogues featuring an N-
heterocyclic
substituent
at
the
10-position
of
the
1-
diphenylphosphanyl-ferrocenylene moiety described by the
groups of Siemeling (d(P–Au) ¼ 2.242 ˚A [2-pyridyl], 2.234 ˚A [3-
pyridyl])80 and Lang (d(P–Au) ¼ 2.215 ˚A [2,20:60,200-terpyridin-40-
yl]),81 yet [1c(Au)3] is the rst such complex containing ferrocene
in the tris-phosphane backbone and the second to incorporate
three ferrocene moieties into a trinuclear gold complex.82
The spectral data of both [1a(Au)3] and [1b(Au)3] are in line
with that of [1c(Au)3] and all complexes are thus presumed to
have similar structures. Notably, [1c(Au)3] does not show auro-
philic interactions83–85 or close ferrocene/metal contacts86 in
the solid state (for M/M distances see Table 2), setting it apart
from related structures regularly displaying aurophilic interac-
tions (Table S7†). In the context of cooperative eﬀects operating
in multimetallic catalysis,49,52,87–90 [1c(Au)3] thus falls short of
the proximity criterion formulated by Feringa as the gold/gold
separation exceeds 6 ˚A.49 Yet, owing to the exibility of the
ligand backbone, gold/gold distances in solution might well
become much closer.
Regarding our vision of using 1-derived complexes as
“rotary” or “dimmable” switches for multi-redox-state applica-
tions, electrochemical characterisation by cyclic voltammetry
(CV) was of utmost relevance. 1,3,5-Tris(ferrocenyl)arenes have
previously been shown91–93 to display reversible redox activity
and, in supporting electrolytes (SE) containing weakly coordi-
nating anions such as [B(C6F5)4] or [B{3,5-(CF3)2C6H3}4]
(BArF
4
),94,95 to furthermore be oxidisable in three separate,
resolved steps.25
Triazine-based 4c and [1c(BH3)3] displayed a similar behav-
iour,43 while 1c, as expected, showed an irreversible electro-
chemical
oxidation
due
to
the
direct
cyclopentadienyl–
phosphorus linkage.75–77,96 Their analogues reported herein
share these redox features (s. Fig. 3, le, for 4a, 1a, and
[1a(BH3)] and Fig. S8–S11†). Gratifyingly, the arene core deter-
mines the exact oxidation potentials (Tables 3 and S9–S12†), in
line with substitution by electron-donating or -withdrawing
groups. The choice of arene thus allows for electrochemically
ne-tuning the whole system. The arene trend also holds true
for [1a–c(Au)3] (Fig. 3, right). In a BF4
-based SE, the three
gold(I) complexes show partly irreversible behaviour (Fig. S12†),

but in all cases, their tris(ferrocenyl)arene cores are oxidised in
one
(quasi)reversible
event.
In
a
BArF
4
-based
SE,
the
tris(ferrocenyl)arene core is again oxidised in three resolved
steps. In our setup (0.1 mol L1 (nBu4N)BF4 or (nBu4N)BArF
4 in
CH2Cl2, 1.75 to 1.2 V vs. FcH/[FcH]+),97 no oxidation of gold(I)
in [1a–c(Au)3] was observed.
This is in line with results from DFT calculations locating the
HOMO at the iron centres; in the mono-oxidised model complex
[1a(Au)3]+, the spin density solely resides at the three iron
centres, too (Fig. S14–S19†). Among the three tris-phosphanes,
1c yields the most anodically shied redox potentials in its
complexes (Fig. 3, right, and Table 3). In line with our previous
ndings, complexes of 1c were also found to display the least
straightforward electrochemistry such as cathodically shied
reductions connected to electron transfer-induced chemical
transformations (EC mechanism; cf. Fig. S13†).43
Redox-switchable gold(I) catalysis
Seeking to demonstrate the applicability of the stepwise oxida-
tion of the s-tris(ferrocenyl)arene core, our choice fell on the
gold-catalysed 5-exo-dig ring-closing isomerisation of N-(2-
propyn-1-yl)benzamide
(5)
to
5-methylene-2-phenyl-4,5-
dihydrooxazole (6) (Scheme 2) as a read-out. Uncovered by
Hashmi and co-workers in 2004,98 the catalytic synthesis of
oxazolines has quickly developed into a standard reaction for
gold(I) complexes.99–104 The groups of Sarkar and Heinze, among
others, have established the transformation of 5 to 6 as a plat-
form to perform and study RSC using gold(I) catalysts.105–109
Rendering the gold(I) centres reversibly more Lewis-acidic and
hence more catalytically active110 through oxidation of a con-
nected ferrocenyl moiety is one way of obviating the sometimes
problematic use of silver salts for activation of gold(I) pre-
catalysts by halide abstraction and enables temporal control
over the activity of the catalyst.111–115 Since we aimed for
a detailed understanding of the switching process, the reaction
was performed on the NMR scale in CD2Cl2, allowing for a time-
resolved study of the reaction through protons Ho (reaction
involving oxidised species) and Hm (reactions not involving
oxidised species) of oxazoline 6 (Fig. S21 and S22†) vs. 1,3,5-
trimethoxybenzene as an internal standard.116–118
Native [1a(Au)3] (crossed light blue circles; Fig. 4), employed
in a 3 mol% Au loading (referring to substrate 5), performed
with low activity (TOF ¼ 2.0  0.2 h1; TOF ts, s. Fig. S39–
S53†). A control experiment without any added gold(I) complex
yielded no product. While [1b(Au)3] (crossed navy squares, TOF
¼ 2.5  0.1 h1) performed slightly better than [1a(Au)3],
potentially due to the slightly more electron-withdrawing 1,3,5-
triuorobenzene core, [1c(Au)3] (crossed turquoise triangles)
did, reproducibly, not show any catalytic activity under the same
conditions. Given that the only diﬀerence is in the s-triazine
core, these nitrogen atoms might interact with the amide
protons of substrate 5, in turn preventing the completion of the
catalytic cycle by protodeauration.98 This hypothesis is sup-
ported comparing the 1H NMR spectra of [1a(Au)3] and [1c(Au)3]
with 3 equivalents of 5, respectively, at 60 C in CD2Cl2,
resulting in a signal splitting for the amide proton signal of 5 in
presence of [1c(Au)3] (Fig. S23†).
In order to test for potential cooperative eﬀects due to its
three gold centres, [AuCl(FcPPh2)] (7) was prepared as a mono-
nuclear gold complex analogue of [1a(Au)3].119 Quite surpris-
ingly, a catalytic evaluation of 7 has not yet been reported. As
judged from 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopy ([1a(Au)3]: d(CD2Cl2) ¼
28.3 ppm; 7: d(CDCl3) ¼ 28.4 ppm) and CV ([1a(Au)3]: E0((nBu4N)
BF4) ¼ 340 mV; 7: E0((nBu4N)PF6) ¼ 320 mV),119 7 is a well-suited
model compound with respect to the electronic properties of
both gold(I) and the ferrocene unit.
At the same concentration of gold(I), [1a(Au)3] clearly out-
performed the catalytically silent 7 (pink pluses, Fig. 4). This

4 (TOF ¼ 20.1  0.6 h1) surpassed that of
[1a(Au)3]/NaBArF
4 (TOF ¼ 3.2  0.1 h1) greatly. Following the
chloride abstraction of [1a(Au)3] by 1H and 31P{1H} NMR spec-
troscopy proved inconclusive but hinted at the slow formation
of a P,P0-dicoordinated gold(I) complex (dP ¼ 42.9 ppm,
Fig. S25†).121–123 An HR-ESI mass spectrum showed signals cor-
responding
to
[M–Au–2Cl]+,
[M–Au–3Cl]2+,
and
[M–2Cl]2+
species. The inferior performance of [1a(Au)3]/NaBArF
4 vs. 7/
NaBArF
4 might thus relate to the formation of chelated and
therefore less substrate-accessible gold(I) species.
Given its favourable redox properties – the lowest oxidation
potentials and three fully reversible and well-separated oxida-
tion events in the BArF
4
-based SE (cf. Fig. 3) – [1a(Au)3] was
chosen as a model (pre-)catalyst for initial tests concerning RSC.
For the oxidation, 1,10-diacetylferrocenium tetrakis(peruoro-
tert-butoxy)aluminate (¼ teonate) (8) was chosen. Next to the
ready synthetic availability from silver(I) teonate124 and 1,10-
diacetylferrocene and the suﬃciently high oxidation potential
(E0 ¼ 490 mV vs. FcH/[FcH]+ in CH2Cl2),125 the highly inert non-
coordinating anion informed this choice. Smaller anions such
as BF4
 and SbCl6
 have been shown to form tight ion pairs
with ferrocenium,105,126 and anion eﬀects in general have been
found crucial for the understanding and tailoring of gold
catalysts.127
Aer the reaction shown in Fig. 4 had reached a 25% yield
(phase I), 1.0 (orange squares), 2.0 (red triangles), or 3.0
(maroon circles) equivalents of 8 were added. The catalytic
activity increased considerably (phase II; cf. Fig. 4, bottom le),
in line with ndings for similar systems.105–109 Gratifyingly, the
activity diﬀered according to the amount of oxidant added: one
equivalent of oxidant resulted in a 5.5-fold, two in a 10-fold, and
three in a 13-fold increase of the experimentally determined
TOF (Fig. 4, bottom). Upon addition of decamethylferrocene (9)
as reductant (phase III), less-than-initial activity (TOFØ ¼ 0.67 
0.06 h1) was restored aer some delay. In control experiments,
employing only 8 or 8 + 9 did not trigger product formation
(Fig. S20 and S21†).
The amplied activity is usually explained by an increase in
Lewis acidity at the gold(I) site,105–109 and DFT calculations for
mono-oxidised [1a(Au)3]+ showed a decrease of energy of
unoccupied gold-centred orbitals by over 1.9 eV (Fig. S14–S19†).
Such a decrease in LUMO energy can cautiously be understood
in terms of increased electrophilicity.128
The diﬀerent activities, which might correspond to distinct
activity states in line with ndings of Zhao and Chen,29 were
found to be easier to distinguish at 1 mol% Au catalyst loading
(Fig. 5, top), decelerating the reaction in so much as to allow for
an OFF–ON–OFF–ON switching sequence. Moreover, adding
two equivalents of 8 to a catalytic run previously oxidised by one
equivalent of 8 (VII to VIII, rose squares), a distinct increase of
activity was found. Due to the negligible initial activity (TOF <
0.05 h1), the great increase in activity is diﬃcult to quantify by
numbers (Fig. 5, centre le). It is, however, evident that the TOF
eﬀected by the re-oxidised species (VI to VII) are slightly larger
than those originating from the rst oxidation for one (rose
squares) and two (pink triangles), yet not for the second
oxidation with three equivalents of 8 (purple circles). Oxidising
what we assume to be the mono-oxidised species [1a(Au)3]+ to
presumably tri-oxidised [1a(Au)3]3+ (VII to VIII) leads to an even
larger reaction rate (TOF ¼ 4.3  0.2 h1). The ON-switching can
also be used on a macroscopic level, to which end two 5 mL-

scale reactions (57 mg 5, 2.2 mg [1a(Au)3], i.e., 1 mol% Au, [5]0 ¼
60 mmol L1) were compared. One run was oxidised using 3.0
eq. 8 at 12.5 h aer the start and led to a quantitative yield vs.
only 20% conversion for the non-switched case aer 42.0 h
(29.5 h aer the ON-switch).129
These ndings are invariant to the order of addition, that is,
the presence of substrate during oxidation;130 when [1a(Au)3] is
oxidised with 1–3 equivalents of 8 before the addition of 5,
similar reaction proles and TOF result (Fig. S26, Table S13†).
In all cases, the rst ON-switch is accompanied by an induction
period which is absent for the re-oxidation (e.g., IV to V vs. VI to
VII in Fig. 5). When [1b(Au)3] (red triangles) is used in the cyc-
lisation (Fig. 5, bottom le) and oxidised using two equivalents
of 8, the same behaviour, including a similar TOF (2.3  0.1 h1)
as for [1a(Au)3], is found. Oxidising [1c(Au)3] (yellow triangles)
with two equivalents of 8 converted the otherwise silent
complex (vide supra) into an active catalyst with higher TOF (3.3
 0.1 h1). Even though other redox-switchable gold(I) catalysts
perform with sometimes signicantly higher activity, complexes
[1a–c(Au)3] were intended as models demonstrating the feasi-
bility of tailorable multi-oxidation-state applications. Lower
observed activities for [1a–c(Au)3] are hence an acceptable trade-
oﬀprior to further optimisation.105,109 In the same way, the
signicantly higher reaction rate of using oxidised 7 (1 mol%
Au, TOF ¼ 10.6  0.4 h1, Fig. S24†) comes at the expense of not
being principally able to address separate states with diﬀering
catalytic activity.
In order to gain more insight into the switching process, the
oxidation of [1a(Au)3] in the absence of substrate was rst fol-
lowed by 1H and 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S27 and S28†).
The 31P{1H} NMR resonance shied upeld and broadened with
each added equivalent of 8, while the subsequent addition of 9
reversed this trend. In line with the ndings from the catalytic
runs, the reduction took quite long to take its full eﬀect.
Given these encouraging results, we sought to isolate the
individually switched complexes [1a(Au)3](TEF)n (n ¼ 1–3),
attempting to dismiss the possibility that oxidising [1a(Au)3]
during the catalytic reaction (in situ) might lead to mixtures of
diﬀerent oxidation states (e.g. by disproportionation). Further-
more, we wanted to ascertain the integrity of the oxidised species,
since Nataro and co-workers observed loss of a chlorido ligand
(G, Chart 2) from dinuclear gold(I) complexes based on 1,10-
bis(phosphanyl)ferrocenes aer chemical oxidation using tris(p-
bromophenyl)ammoniumyl
tetrakis(pentauorophenyl)-borate
(“Magic Blue”).131 While the group of Peris found oxidation-

imidazolylidene backbone in their gold(I) chloride complexes
upon addition of acetylferrocenium tetrauoroborate,126 Heinze
and co-workers described valence isomerisation from, initially,
FeIII/AuI to FeII/AuII (J, Chart 2) assisted by both the SbCl6
 anion
of their oxidant and propargylic amide 5.105 In the last two
instances, the respective Au–Cl fragment was found to remain
intact.
Gratifyingly, [1a(Au)3](TEF)n can indeed by obtained as
analytically pure compounds from the reaction of [1a(Au)3] with
1, 2, or 3 equivalents of 8 as evidenced by CHN analyses. While
[1a(Au)3](TEF) is a pale green powder, both [1a(Au)3](TEF)2 and
[1a(Au)3](TEF)3
are
dark-green
microcrystalline
solids.
In
contrast to [1a(Au)3], they are readily soluble in diethyl ether
which allows for their purication by precipitation with
pentanes, as 1,10-diacetylferrocene is soluble under these
conditions and can hence be extracted. The eﬀective magnetic
moments meﬀof [1a(Au)3](TEF)n in solution were determined
using Evans' method (Fig. S99, S103 and S107†) and match the
expected spin-only values for one (2.03 mB, expected: 1.73 mB),
two (2.98 mB, expected: 2.83 mB), and three (3.52 mB, expected:
3.82 mB) unpaired electrons reasonably well.132,133 The 1H and
31P{1H} NMR-spectroscopic features (Fig. S98–S109†) match
those of the previously mentioned stepwise oxidation (Fig. S27
and S28†). HR-ESI mass spectra show peaks for the three
diﬀerent cations respectively, the tri-cation [1a(Au)3]3+ appar-
ently stabilised by a tight contact to the teonate anion as
{[1a(Au)3](TEF)}2+ under these conditions; similarly, the 19F
resonance of [1a(Au)3](TEF)3 (u1/2 ¼ 17 Hz) is slightly broadened
with respect to that of the mono- and dioxidised species (u1/2 ¼
4 Hz). IR spectra (Fig. S29†) of [1a(Au)3](TEF)n display both the
signature of the teonate anion and a band at 860 cm1, char-
acteristic for the d(C–H) vibration of ferrocenium.134,135 In line
with previous reports,136 the ferrocenylene n(C–H) stretches shi
to higher wavenumbers upon increasing degree of oxidation
and do not indicate the presence of native or lower oxidation
states as expected for disproportionation. Neither can this be
inferred from UV/Vis spectra of [1a(Au)3](TEF)n (Fig. 6 top right,
Fig. S30†), as they diﬀer in the position of their bands at long
wavelength, most likely related to LMCT, inner ferrocenyl, and
potentially even to AuI–FeIII MMCT transitions,106,137,138 between
500 and 1000 nm.

As nal proof for the site of oxidation, we were able to isolate
single crystals of the tri-oxidised complex as {[1a(Au)3]}2(TEF)6
(Fig. 6, leand bottom right), thus unambiguously conrming
the oxidation state of three times FeIII through the presence of
six, albeit only partly crystallographically describable, teonate
anions per asymmetric unit. Notably, all three P–Au–Cl frag-
ments are still intact and form dimers of an overall sixfold
positive charge through a set of two aurophilic interactions
(d(Au(1)–Au(6)) ¼ 2.989(1) ˚A, d(Au(2)–Au(4)) ¼ 3.188(1) ˚A) and
a less-close Au/Au contact (d(Au(3)/Au(5)) ¼ 3.397(1) ˚A).139
While the poor crystal quality precludes detailed metric anal-
yses, generally larger C5H4(centroid)–Fe distances of over 1.68 ˚A
and, accordingly, Fe–C bond lengths of up to 2.15(2) ˚A, typical
for ferrocenium species,136,140 are discernible (Table S8†). Other
structural parameters, particularly with respect to the P–Au–Cl
moieties are, within error, comparable to the molecular struc-
ture of [1c(Au)3]. While ferrocenium cations are frequently
encountered as counter cations for metallate anions and several
homo- and heteromultinuclear bridged metallocenes featuring
ferrocenium
units
have
been
listed
in
the
CSD,
{[1a(Au)3]}2(TEF)6 is a very rare example of a crystallographically
characterised metal complex containing ferrocenium in its
ligand backbone. To the best of our knowledge, a rhenium(0)
carbonyl complex by Nataro and co-workers is the only other
example to contain both ferrocenium and a phosphane-bound
metal complex fragment,141 while the +III oxidation state of
iron in reported bis[1,10-bis(diphenylphosphanyl)ferrocenium]
hexadecachlorotetraantimonate(III) by the group of Kasim142 has
been questioned by both Nataro and Connick.143 Not backed up
by a solid-state molecular structure, Grandberg and co-workers
also reported a phosphanyl ferrocenium-based gold(III) bromide
complex in 1977.144 Last but not least, a very recent report by the
Lapinte group details a related tetranuclear iron(II/III) half-
sandwich array with potential use in molecular electronics.145
[1a(Au)3](TEF)n appear to be air- and moisture-insensitive in
the solid state for short periods. They can be weighed out in
ambient conditions but quickly turn from green to yellow
solutions in wet solvents. Their stability in dry CD2Cl2 was
monitored by 1H and 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S31–
S33†). Surprisingly, a solution of [1a(Au)3](TEF)3 did show little
change over three days while [1a(Au)3](TEF) and [1a(Au)3](TEF)2
slowly decomposed under the same conditions (room temper-
ature, protected from light). 31P{1H} resonances attributable to
P,P0-dicoordinate species at around 40 ppm appeared, and
[1a(Au)3](TEF)2 produced a metallic mirror of presumably
elemental gold on the wall of the NMR tube. Furthermore, the
1H NMR spectral evolution of [1a(Au)3](TEF)2 (Fig. S32†) indi-
cates at least some degree of disproportionation to the mono-
and trioxidised species, making it the least solution-stable of
the three isolated oxidation products. Although a mass spec-
trum of the crystals of [1a(Au)3](TEF)3 does not contain signals
for dimeric species, aurophilic interactions in solution might
play a role in stabilising the trication. When fresh solutions of
[1a(Au)3](TEF)n (n ¼ 1–3) are reacted with one, two, or three
equivalents of reductant 9, native [1a(Au)3] is re-obtained
respectively (Fig. S34–S36†).
The isolated oxidised species [1a(Au)3](TEF)n have nally
also been tested for their catalytic performance (ex situ; Fig. 5,

bottom right). Their TOF show the previously noted distinct
dependence on the degree of oxidation, with tri-oxidised
[1a(Au)3](TEF)3 (light blue circles, 5.8  0.1 h1) performing
with
about
threefold
activity
than
mono-oxidised
[1a(Au)3](TEF) (navy squares, 1.8  0.1 h1). All of them
outperform
the
in
situ-oxidised
species,
most
notably
[1a(Au)3](TEF)3. This points towards redox equilibria between
8 and the complexes in higher oxidation states which might be
overcome using stronger oxidants, thus ensuring full conver-
sion upon addition. Even though we cannot fully exclude
potential disproportionation or the presence of mixtures
under these catalytic conditions, the distinctly diﬀerent
activities in the read-out catalytic conversion strongly suggest
that [1a(Au)3] and its analogues can function as molecular
switches with four addressable states.
Similar to the in situ-generated species, induction periods
are observed for [1a(Au)3](TEF)n. Notably, the addition of a fresh
batch of 5 to an almost-completed reaction aer 24 h (Fig. S37†)
using [1a(Au)3](TEF)3 did not result in another induction period
but led to a slight loss of activity (3.2  0.1 vs. 5.0  0.1 h1).
Mixing isolated [1a(Au)3](TEF)3 with 5 (Fig. S38†) in CH2Cl2 led
to an appreciably slow colour change which was followed by
time-resolved UV/Vis spectroscopy. We thus speculate that the
catalytically active species
are, in general, formed from
a chemical process involving 5. Bearing in mind the afore-
mentioned results from Heinze and co-workers and in accor-
dance
with
loss
of
the
FeIII-associated
absorptions
of
[1a(Au)3](TEF)3 at long wavelength,105 a coordination-assisted
valence isomerisation from FeIII/AuI to FeII/AuII might be at
the heart of this behaviour.
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated the modular syntheses of
a new class of tris(ferrocenyl)arene-based tris-phosphanes 1
which can be used to form well-dened, C3-symmetric homo-
trinuclear gold(I) complexes. Four oxidation states relating to
the tris(ferrocenyl)arene backbone – non-, mono-, di-, and tri-
oxidised – have been identied by cyclic voltammetry. Stoi-
chiometric oxidation of [1a(Au)3] produces isolable products
[1a(Au)3](TEF)n. This redox behaviour can be advantageously
used in redox-switchable catalysis ex and in situ, as we were
able to show for the proof-of-principle ring-closing isomer-
isation of N-(2-propyn-1-yl)benzamide (5) forming oxazoline 6.
The arene cores determine the exact redox potential and were
also found to inuence the catalytic performance of the native
and oxidised species, a feature which we are currently inves-
tigating in more detail. Metal complexes of 1 and its analogues
thus hold great promise for applications in molecular elec-
tronics and logic, possibly extending binary to quaternary
signal processing, as four diﬀerent oxidation states can be
addressed and isolated.
