Metal–Ligand Cooperativity of the Calix[4]pyrrolato Aluminate:
Triggerable C@C Bond Formation and Rate Control in Catalysis
Fabian Ebner, Lukas Maximilian Sigmund, and Lutz Greb*
Abstract: Metal-ligand cooperativity (MLC) had a remarkable
impact on transition metal chemistry and catalysis. By use of
the calix[4]pyrrolato aluminate, [1]@, which features a square-
planar AlIII, we transfer this concept into the p-block and fully
elucidate its mechanisms by experiment and theory. Comple-
mentary to transition metal-based MLC (aromatization upon
substrate binding), substrate binding in [1]@ occurs by
dearomatization of the ligand. The aluminate trapps carbonyls
by the formation of C@C and Al@O bonds, but the products
maintain full reversibility and outstanding dynamic exchange
rates. Remarkably, the C@C bonds can be formed or cleaved by
the addition or removal of lithium cations, permitting unpre-
cedented control over the systemQs constitutional state. More-
over, the metal-ligand cooperative substrate interaction allows
to twist the kinetics of catalytic hydroboration reactions in
a unique sense. Ultimately, this work describes the evolution of
an anti-vanQt Hoff/Le Bel species from their being as a struc-
tural curiosity to their application as a reagent and catalyst.
Introduction
Metal-ligand cooperativity (MLC) within transition metal
complexes has become an indispensable tool for bond
activation chemistry and homogeneous catalysis.[1] Due to
enormous research efforts, e.g., by the Milstein group,
a variety of atom-economic and waste-free catalytic processes
have been developed.[2] A particular impetus was provided by
the aromatization/dearomatization strategy, which operates
by reversible aromatization of the ligand backbone upon
interaction with the substrates.[2c] The herein often encoun-
tered scenario involves the synergistic binding of unsaturated
substrates (carbonyls, CO2, or nitriles) to the metal center and
ligand backbone (Figure 1A). Although this type of reactivity
does not require oxidation-state changes, consistently, redox-
active metals of the d-block, such as manganese,[3] molybde-
num,[4] ruthenium,[5] rhodium,[6] iridium[7] or rhenium[8] were
used. Surprisingly, a transfer of the aromatization/dearoma-
tization concept to the p-block is still at its beginnings.[9] Even
the much more general field of MLC with p-block elements is
developing hesitantly only.[9b,10] A possible reason for this
limited success might be the low inherent reactivity of p-block
elements in their conventional oxidation and saturated
valence states. Structural constraint offers a promising alter-
native to amplify reactivity by exposing space for substrate
coordination and alteration of the frontier molecular orbital
energies.[11]
We recently reported the anti-vanQt Hoff/Le Bel-config-
urated meso-octamethylcalix[4]pyrrolato aluminate ([1]@)
with a square-planar coordinated aluminum(III) atom (Fig-
ure 1B).[12] Planarization not only provokes a LUMO energy
lowering in [1]@ but also raises the energy of the ligand-based
HOMO in comparison to the tetrahedral counterpart Al(-
pyrrolato)4
@.[12] Thus, [1]@ provides a small HOMO–LUMO
gap with an electron-deficient metal center and a nearby
electron-rich pyrrole moiety—ideally setting the scene for
MLC reactivity. Herein, we report the MLC binding of C=O-
containing substrates at [1]@, the highly dynamic covalent
features of the products and its implications for catalysis.

Results and Discussion
Exposing [PPh4][1] to 2 bar CO2 in dichloromethane at
room temperature resulted in a color change from colorless to
yellow within seconds. The
1H NMR spectrum revealed
a clean and quantitative reaction. Strongly downfield-shifted
signals of two pyrrolic protons indicate the dearomatization
of one pyrrole unit (Figure 2A). The initial D2d-symmetry of
[1]@ is lowered to C1, resulting in eight chemically inequiva-
lent pyrrolic and methyl positions. Yellow crystals suitable for
SCXRD analysis were obtained from a dichloromethane/
toluene/THF solution at room temperature. The measure-
ments illustrate the structure of [PPh4][1*-CO2] (Figure 2C, in
the following, * designates a dearomatized state of one
pyrrole unit in the ligand). Binding of CO2 occurs in
a bidentate fashion by the formation of a C@C bond (155.8-
(6) pm) and Al@O bond (184.8(3) pm). The Al@O bond is in
the range of other higher coordinated aluminum centres,[13]
whereas the C1-C29 bond is elongated in comparison to
common sp3-sp2 C@C single bonds.[14] The shortened C4-N1
and C2-C3 bonds verify the dearomatization of the pyrrole
ring. This MLC-type 1,2-addition process is in striking
contrast to the commonly observed insertion of CO2 into
polar metal-nitrogen bonds,[15] or reported reactivities of Al-
porphyrin complexes,[16] but manifests the electron-rich ligand
as nucleophilic reaction side.
Although calix[4]pyrroles have been extensively studied
as ligands for transition metals, this mode of reactivity was
observed only with TiIV and has not been followed any
further.[17] It strongly resembles the MLC binding of CO2 with
transition metal complexes.[3–,5c–f,6–8]
Appealed by the ease and purity of this reaction, [PPh4][1]
was subjected to cyclohexane carboxaldehyde (CyA), para-
methylbenzaldehyde (pMe-BA) and para-nitrobenzaldehyde
(pNO2-BA) under analog conditions as for CO2. Quantitative
conversions to the 1,2-addition products were detected by
1H NMR spectroscopy immediately after aldehyde addition
showing similar spectroscopic features of a dearomatized
ligand pyrrole unit (Figure 3A). Suitable yellow crystals of
[PPh4][1*-CyA], [PPh4][1*-pNO2-BA] and [PPh4][1*-pMe-
BA] for SCXRD were obtained from saturated dichloro-
methane/toluene solutions at room temperature. Generally,
those structures illustrate the same 1,2-carboalumination
pattern as for CO2 (Figure 3B). Again, the formed Al@O
bond lengths are in the range of common Al-O-bonds (Al-O
distances [pm]: [PPh4][1*-CyA]: 176.7(2), [PPh4][1*-pMeBA]:
179.0(2), [PPh4][1*-pNO2BA]: 180.0(1)) and the C@C bonds
slightly elongated (C@C distances [pm]: [PPh4][1*-CyA]:
159.9(3), [PPh4][1*-pMeBA]: 159.6(4), [PPh4][1*-pNO2BA]:
160.1(2)). All adducts exhibit Al-N distances in a range of
189–196 pm for the aromatic pyrroles but elongated dative
Al@N bonds (Al-Ndearom. = 197–199 pm) for the dearomatized
pyrrole rings. During the addition process, the formation of
diastereomers was observed. All stereochemical aspects are
discussed in section 12.2 of the supporting information.
Given the formation of enthalpically strong C@C and Al@
O bonds and the liberation of a square-planar aluminum

center from its unique coordination environment, one would
expect tight and irreversible binding of the substrates
considered so far. However, in all cases, full reversibility of
the addition process was observed. Adding 2 bar of CO2 to
a 13C-labeled adduct [Li(thf)n][1*-13CO2] in dichloromethane
resulted in a smooth exchange of 13CO2 over 18 h at room
temperature, again in close similarity with PNN- or PNP
complexes of RuII or ReI (Figure 4A).[5a,e,8] Moreover, CO2
was readily replaced by the addition of most aldehydes to [1*-
CO2]@, yielding the aldehyde adducts in a remarkable purity
(Figure 4B). Even the aldehyde binding products maintain
dynamic covalent bonding. For example, pNO2-BA quantita-
tively replaces pMe-BA from [1*-pMe-BA]@ (for a full list of
substrate replacement assays, see Table S1). Generally, alde-
hydes with lower resonance stabilization energy of the C=O
bonds (electron-poor aromatics)[18] readily replace aldehydes
with more stabilized C=O bonds—in perfect agreement with
the computational results (vide infra). In line with this trend,
the
more
electron-rich
para-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde
(pDMA-BA) binds weaker to [1]@. Upon mixing [PPh4][1]
and pDMA-BA in dichloromethane at room temperature,
broad signals were observed in the
1H NMR spectrum,
pointing on a fast exchange on NMR timescale. Only by
cooling this solution to @258C, signals for the 1,2-adduct
developed (Figure S4). Besides, other adduct forms were
observed at low temperature, that will become of importance
during the mechanistic studies of the process (vide infra).
Next, we inspected the kinetics of the aldehyde-aldehyde
exchange process in detail. The substitution of pMe-BA by
adding pNO2-BA to [1*-pMe-BA]@ proceeded in < 1 ms at
@808C in dichloromethane and its kinetics were not even
measurable with a stopped-flow UV/Vis-setup. However,
such high reaction rates enable studies by dynamic NMR
spectroscopy.
Indeed, a mixture of CyA and [PPh4][1*-CyA] revealed
self-exchange detectable by phase-sensitive EXSY-NMR
spectroscopy in CD2Cl2 (Figure 4C). Based on the measured
rate constant k = 0.08 s@1 at 298.15 K, a value for DG* =
79.4 kJmol@1 was obtained and found in good agreement
with DFT calculations of the rate-determining step for the
overall process (see computational section). An even lower
barrier is demarcated by the broad signals and fast exchange
regime with pDMA-BA at room temperature (DG* <
50 kJmol@1), as described above. EXSY-measurements with
varying aldehyde concentrations revealed no effect on the
reaction rate (Figure S13). This is an important finding, as it
allowed us to characterize the process as dissociative and
legitimates the neglect of associative pathways in the compu-
tational evaluation. Overall, these systems undergo the fastest
reversible carbon-carbon bond formation reactions ever
determined, surpassing even the most rapid Diels Alder
reactions with highly activated diene/dienophile combina-
tions.[19] Given the exceptional rates and the high selectivity of
this process, the ideal basis for applications in the field of
dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) is at hand.[20]
After having obtained the fundamental thermodynamic
and kinetic parameters for the binding process, further
mechanistic insights were collected. The 1,2-adduct formation
can be conceived either as a step-wise Al@O=C@R s-adduct
formation/C@C bond formation or as a concerted process.
First, the low-temperature NMR spectroscopic results of the
mixture of [PPh4][1] and pDMA-BA were reconsidered. As
mentioned above, besides the 1,2-adduct, other species were
observed at @258C. The apparent solution state symmetry of
the second principal component indicated a local C2v sym-
metry at the [1]@ entity, known from our previous studies with
pure s-donors (Figure S5).[12] The observation of a clear
EXSY exchange peak between the 1,2-adduct and this s-
adduct further substantiated its putative role as intermediate
in the reaction sequence (Figure S8). The use of substrates
with less reactive C=O bonds provided further insights. The
reaction of [PPh4][1] with acetone led to broad
1H NMR
signals, similar to the pDMA-BA case (Figure S3). The
characteristic signals of a s-adduct and the formation of the
1,2-adducts occurred at a lower temperature (@508C). Note-
worthy, this latter reaction disclosed that the reversible
carbonyl binding is not restricted to aldehydes but holds
likewise for ketones. By using formamide or dimethylforma-
mide as substrates with even larger resonance stabilization
energy of the C=O bond, the s-adduct formation was readily

observed by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Figure S20), but the 1,2-
adduct formation did not occur. Having collected sufficient
spectroscopic evidence, we were pleased to obtain unambig-
uous proof for the s-adducts also by SCXRD analysis.
Computational Section
After having spotted the participation of s-adducts,
quantum-theoretical studies gained a further understanding.
For all substrates, the full reaction path, including s-adduct,
the final 1,2-adduct, and the corresponding transition states,
were
identified

the

theory
(Fig-
ure 5A). First, the reaction process is illustrated for acetone,
for which the s-adduct and the 1,2-adduct have been observed
by 1H NMR spectroscopy. In agreement with the experiment,
the s-adduct between acetone and [1]@ was found as a global
minimum at (DG = @5.9 kJmol@1), with the 1,2-adduct lying
higher in energy (DG = 23.1 kJmol@1). The reaction barrier to
the s-adduct is caused by the bending of the calix[4]pyrrolato
ligand during the entrance of the carbonyl in the coordination
sphere of the planar aluminate [1]@. The formation of the C@
C bond and the dearomatization of one pyrrole unit provokes
the second reaction barrier. Intrinsic reaction coordinate
(IRC) calculations were performed, and the intrinsic bond
orbitals (IBOs)[21] were calculated along the path (Figure 5B).
They nicely illustrate the transformation of the aromatic
pyrrole bond (blue IBO) into the C@C s-bond and the
dearomatization of the pyrrole ring. A comparison of the
thermodynamics and reaction barriers for all substrates was
accomplished next (Figure 5A). The more electron-deficient
the carbonyl functionality and the less sterically hindered, the
more favorable is the 1,2-adduct formation over the s-
adduct—in agreement with the experimental findings. For the
most electron-deficient aldehyde pNO2-BA, no stable s-
adduct was found on the PES. The 1,2-adducts of CyA and
pMe-BA are almost thermoneutral to each other. In line with
that, it was observed experimentally that a mixture of [PPh4]
[1*-pMe-BA] and CyA immediately developed a dynamic
mixture of [PPh4][1*-CyA], [PPh4][1*-pMe-BA], free CyA
and free pMe-BA (Figure S39). Generally, the first reaction
barriers for the s-adduct formation (DG*
TS1) do not differ
significantly between the various substrates. Surprisingly, they
are higher as for the C@C bond formation step (DG*
TS2),
confirming the experimental non-observability of the s-
adduct intermediates for most cases. Importantly, for all
aldehydes, two diastereomeric s-adducts and 1,2-adducts
have to be considered (a full discussion can be found in the
supporting information, section 12.2). To conclude, the com-
puted thermodynamics of the reaction products and inter-
mediates ideally match with the experimental product
distributions and the calculated reaction barriers are in good
agreement with the experimentally derived values (e.g., for
CyA: DG*
exp = 79.4 kJmol@1/DG*
comp = 63.7 kJmol@1).
Influence of the Countercation—Providing a Trigger for C@C
Bond Formation and Catalytic Reaction Control
The previous sections clarified the binding of carbonyls
with the [PPh4][1] system. Now, the influence of the counter-
action to [1]@ was studied. Cases in which the s-adduct
formation with [PPh4][1] was favored were of particular
interest. The addition of lithium iodide to the s-adduct of
pDMA-BA with [PPh4][1] in [D2]dichloromethane induced
the quantitative transformation to the 1,2-adducts (Figure 6A
and Figures S15). The process can be followed by the naked
eye, as both adduct forms differ in their coloration.

In addition to NMR spectroscopy, this behavior was
validated by SCXRD analysis of [Li(thf)2][1*-pDMA-BA]
(Figure 6C). Herein the Li+ is h5-coordinated to an aromatic
pyrrole ring and bridges to the oxygen atom of the bound CO
moiety. The Al@O and C@C bond lengths are similar to the
spontaneously formed 1,2-adducts, shown in Figure 3. The
same sequence is found with the s-adduct of [PPh4][1] and
acetone or cyclopentanone upon the addition of lithium
iodide or use of [Li-(thf)4][1-thf] (for SCXRD see SI and
Figures S13–S16). Strikingly, the lithium ion-induced C@C
bond formation can be reversed. After the addition of 12-
crown-4 as a complexation agent for Li+, the original broad
signals of the s-adducts reappear in the 1H NMR spectrum.
By the addition of further lithium iodide, the process can be
repeated (Figure S21). Quantum chemical calculations fully
supported our observations. The coordination of a [Li-dme]+
fragment to the [1*-carbonyl] adducts leads to a computed
stabilization
of
the
1,2-adduct
by
20–70 kJmol@1
(Fig-
ure S104). In the case of acetone and pDMA-BA, this effect
indeed turns the process from endergonic to exergonic.
Hence, the addition of a lithium cation offers quantitative yet
reversible control over the formation of a C@C bond. Such
a straightforward and mild trigger is, to the best of our
knowledge, unprecedented. Given the very clean reaction
outcome, achievable within seconds by merely combining
easy to handle crystalline solids, it constitutes a triggerable
reversible click reaction.[22] It offers a stimulus to steer the
constitutional state and covalent dynamics of systems, attrac-
tive for the controlled release of conjugated cargo, or as
a temporary protecting group. The possibility for reversal
permits to “lock-and-unlock” the constitutional dynamics of
the system at will. Given the strongly altered physicochemical
properties of the s- vs. the 1,2-adduct (e.g., dipole moment,
light absorption), it might allow introducing features like
visual feedback, responsiveness, and self-healing into new
functional materials.
Eager to identify a model catalytic application that is
influenced by the MLC binding mode of [1]@
, the hydro-
boration of aldehydes with pinacolborane was probed (Fig-
ure 6D). The most activated aldehyde pNO2-BA undergoes
slow hydroboration already in the absence of a catalyst
(Figure S46), but the other considered C=O containing
substrates were unreactive without a catalyst under the given
conditions (Figures S48/51). However, in the presence of
0.05 mol% of [PPh4][1], all compounds were catalytically
hydroborated. Although not competing with the most effi-
cient hydroboration catalysts,[23] it is more the effect of MLC
on the kinetics that makes this system interesting from
a conceptual point of view.
With 0.05 mol% of [PPh4][1] in [D8]THF, pDMA-BA is
hydroborated only slowly (20% conversion after 2 h, Fig-
ure 6D, light blue curve). However, with the lithium salt
[Li(thf)4][1-thf] as the catalyst, the efficiency is boosted
dramatically, and the reaction went to completion within
20 min under the same conditions (dark blue curve). The role
of lithium cations as the catalytically active species was ruled

out by employing 0.1 mol% LiOTf or LiI (without [1]@), in
which case no reaction occurred (Figure S54). For acetone,
a more than 50-fold increase in reaction rate was observed
between [PPh4][1] (dotted yellow curve) and [Li(thf)4][1-thf]
(thick yellow curve). Thus, with 0.05 mol% of the [Li(thf)4][1-
thf] catalyst system in [D8]THF, remarkable TOFs of
> 4500 h@1 for pDMA-BA and 2000 h@1 for acetone were
achieved. In [D2]dichloromethane as a solvent, even a > 100-
fold rate increase was noted (Figure S42). In stark contrast,
a much less pronounced increase of the reaction rate for the
catalyzed hydroboration of pNO2-BA happened with [Li-
(thf)4][1-thf] in comparison to [PPh4][1] (Figure 6D, red
curves). Noteworthily, pNO2-BA forms the 1,2-adduct with
both salts of [1]@. Since the 1,2-bound states in d-block MLC-
catalysis represent resting states,[5d,g] it was concluded that
also in the present case, the 1,2-form represents a deactivated
state in the hydroboration cycle. However, the partial release
of the 1,2-mode into the s-adduct in the case of acetone and
pDMA-BA delivers a highly reactive form that is activated
both by the Lewis acidic aluminum center and the nearby
lithium cation. Hence, the considerable rate-increase for only
two substrates (pDMA-BA and acetone) and the relatively
small effect for the most activated substrate (pNO2-BA)
showcases the unique impact of MLC on the reaction kinetics.
Usually, strongly activated substrates show high turnover
frequencies with conventional catalysts (such as with Lewis
acid or Lewis base catalysts).[23] However, in the case of [1]@ as
the catalyst, such substrates (pNO2-BA in our case) get
effectively blocked by the MLC 1,2-binding mode and allow
the less activated substrates such as pDMA-BA and acetone
to outpace. In other words, the MLC-dependent mode of
substrate interaction allows to twist common selectivity
trends and might enable a novel mode to steer regioselectiv-
ities in more complex substrates.
Conclusion
A successful transfer of the d-block MLC-concept into the
p-block would allow to couple the abundance of metals such
as aluminum with the vast range of established d-block MLC
catalytic transformations. Understanding the mechanistic
details of MLC with main group elements is vital for this
transfer. The herein presented work provides critical steps in
such a direction. The calix[4]pyrrolato aluminate offers
exceptionally high rates in the capture and release of C=O
containing substrates. These features promptly raise the
question on the driving force, that facilitates rapid trans-
formations by cleavage of a C@C and Al@O bond. In contrast
to the aromatization/dearomatization process observed in
transition metal complexes, [1]@ operates by a reversed
dearomatization/aromatization sequence. Thus, qualitatively,
the regain of aromaticity in a pyrrole ring governs the
behavior in the substrate bound state. The full reversibility
paired with the substantial alteration of the substratesQ
electronic structures upon binding provides an ideal starting
point for catalytic applications. By now, it permits unique
control over reaction kinetics if applied as a hydroboration
catalyst. We believe that the hereby developed perspectives
will serve exemplary for exciting progress and retrofit the
fields of MLC and DCC with the beneficial earth abundance
of aluminum.
