Abstract 
Objective:  Using high-throughput RNA sequencing technology, this study aimed to sequence the transcriptome of 
kidney and liver tissues harvested from Peninsular Malaysia cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis). M. fascicula-
ris are significant nonhuman primate models in the biomedical field, owing to the macaque’s biological similarities 
with humans. The additional transcriptomic dataset will supplement the previously described Peninsular Malaysia M. 
fascicularis transcriptomes obtained in a past endeavour.
Results:  A total of 75,350,240 sequence reads were obtained via Hi-seq 2500 sequencing technology. A total of 5473 
significant differentially expressed genes were called. Gene ontology functional categorisation showed that cellular 
process, catalytic activity, and cell part categories had the highest number of expressed genes, while the metabolic 
pathways category possessed the highest number of expressed genes in the KEGG pathway analysis. The additional 
sequence dataset will further enrich existing M. fascicularis transcriptome assemblies, and provide a dataset for further 
downstream studies.

Introduction
Cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) are non-
human primate (NHP) models significant to biomedi-
cine due to their close evolutionary relationship with 
humans. The cynomolgus macaque’s recapitulation of 
human physiology, genetics, and behaviour is advanta-
geous as translational models for various studies in the 
biomedical field, including drug development and safety 
testing [1, 2]. Cynomolgus macaque individuals from dif-
ferent geographical locations have been shown to exhibit 
genetic characteristics that varies between geographi-
cal origins [3]. Therefore, it is vital that the genomes 
and transcriptomes of cynomolgus macaque NHP mod-
els originating from different geographical locations are 
sequenced as a reference for future biomedical research 
design and implementation.
This study describes the RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) 
of two tissues—kidney and liver—harvested from wild 
Peninsular Malaysian cynomolgus macaques, and is 
an extension of a previous study [4] whereby the lymph 
node, spleen, and thymus transcriptomes of wild Penin-
sular Malaysian M. fascicularis were also sequenced with 
RNA-seq technology. An additional 75,350,240 sequence 
reads were obtained from this study, supplementing the 
previous wild Peninsular Malaysian M. fascicularis data-
set for downstream applications. Furthermore, addi-
tional Malaysian cynomolgus macaque RNA-seq datasets 
will further furnish the cynomolgus macaque genome

Main text
Materials and methods
Samples
Two male conflict macaques that appeared to belong 
in the same family group were captured by the Depart-
ment of Wildlife and National Parks (DWNP) from the 
state of Selangor. Visual examination showed that the 
macaques were free of disease. Euthanisation and har-
vesting of organs were also performed by authorised and 
qualified veterinarians of DWNP. In brief, the macaques 
were sedated intramuscularly using general anaesthe-
sia (combination of ketamine, 5–10 mg/kg and xylazine, 
0.2–0.4 mg/kg) before a lethal dosage of ­Dolethal® were 
given intravenously. Harvested kidney and liver tissues 
were stored in RNAlater RNA Stabilization Agent (Qia-
gen). Total RNA extraction was carried out with RNeasy 
Mini Kit (Qiagen). A modified protocol was employed 
to remove genomic DNA contamination by incorporat-
ing Epicentre’s DNase I solution. RNA extract integrity 
was determined using 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Tech-
nologies, Inc., United States of America) via RNA Pico 
chip. Samples with RIN > 7.0 were selected for library 
construction.
High‑throughput sequencing, data analysis, and validation
Preparation of M. fascicularis kidney and liver RNA-seq 
libraries followed methods previously described in Ee Uli 
et al. [4]. Raw sequencing reads were submitted to NCBI 
Short Read Archive under accessions SRX2499144-
SRX2499147. For data analyses, we used the same bio-
informatic workflow and tools as depicted in our earlier 
publication [4]. Briefly, the assembly of raw sequence 
reads, normalisation, empirical analysis of differentially 
expressed genes (EDGE test), and gene ontology (GO) 
and KEGG pathway annotations were performed in CLC 
Genomics Workbench (CLCGW) version 7.5.1 (Qiagen 
Denmark), while functional classification of expressed 
genes in the kidney and liver transcriptomes was per-
formed using Panther Database version 11.1 released on 
2016-10-24 (http://panth​erdb.org/) and DAVID Bioin-
formatics Resources version 6.8 (https​://david​-d.ncifc​
rf.gov/home.jsp). To better present the tissue-specific 
genes, we combined gene expression data from this 
study and our previous study [4] to create a Venn dia-
gram representation of tissue-specific genes using the 
web tool Venn Diagrams (http://bioin​forma​tics.psb.ugent​
.be/webto​ols/Venn). Validation of the RNA-seq dataset 
was performed with NanoString nCounter Elements XT 
(NanoString Technologies Inc., Seattle, WA, USA) gene 
expression assay. The methodology was the same as pre-
viously described in Ee Uli et al. [4]. Additional file 1 lists 
the genes utilised for the RNA-seq validation and their 
respective probe pair sequences.
Results
Sequence reads trimming and RNA‑seq mapping
The number of raw kidney and liver sequence reads 
obtained were 44,452,083 and 30,898,157 respectively, 
each read possessing a sequence length of 70 bp. After 
trimming, the number of kidney and liver sequence reads 
were 41,854,334 and 28,943,585 singly. Summing up to a 
total of 70,788,919 good quality reads retained for assem-
bly, with the average lengths of the reads ranging from 
58.8 to 60.1 bp. Post-trimming, 93.94% of the reads were 
retained and were considered suitable for RNA-seq map-
ping. The overall mapping percentage of the sequence 
reads for each RNA-seq library ranged from 65.00 to 
68.59%. Additional file 2 summarises the statistics of the 
sequence reads trimming and mapping.
Normalisation and differential gene expression analysis
A total of 5473 significant differentially expressed genes 
were called. Additional file  3 lists the differentially 
expressed genes identified from the EDGE test with 
their respective annotated gene names and descriptions. 
Within the Kidney vs. Liver tissue comparison, the top 
three most upregulated genes in liver were PLA2G2A, 
SAA1, and ORM1, while the three most downregulated 
genes include UMOD, TINAG, and DHDH.
Tissue‑specific genes
Using gene expression data obtained from our previous 
study [4] and this study, a Venn diagram representation of 
tissue-specific genes in kidney, liver, lymph node, spleen, 
and thymus tissues was generated (Fig. 1). Lymph node 
showed the highest number of tissue-specific genes (2156 
genes) among the five tissues compared; while kidney 
and liver had 310 and 154 tissue-specific genes respec-
tively. The three most highly expressed tissue-specific 
genes in the kidney include MIOX, AQP2, and CDH16, 
while the top three tissue-specific genes expressed in the 
liver include APCS, APOA2, and LOC102121341. A com-
plete list of tissue-specific genes can be found in Addi-
tional file 4.
Functional annotation and classification
In the kidney, 14,001, 7046, and 5635 expressed genes 
were categorised to biological process, molecular func-
tion, and cellular component domains respectively, while 
12,004, 6059, and 4935 expressed genes in the liver were 
categorised to BP, MF, and CC domains respectively. The 
distribution of the expressed genes into different level

2 GO categories are shown in Table 1. The BP category 
with the highest number of expressed genes for both tis-
sues is cellular process (kidney, 4039; liver, 3496). For the 
MF domain, the catalytic activity category contains the 
highest number of expressed genes for both tissues (kid-
ney, 2709; liver, 2419). As for CC, both tissues show the 
highest number of expressed genes in the cell part cat-
egory (kidney, 2185; liver, 1954).
In the kidney and liver, a total of 4406 and 3960 genes 
were assigned to KEGG pathway categories respectively. 
The metabolic pathways category contains the highest 
number of expressed genes for both kidney and liver tis-
sues—903 and 839 genes respectively. The distribution of 
the expressed genes into different KEGG pathway catego-
ries are shown in Table 2.
Validation of RNA‑seq differential gene expression
Thirteen genes were selected to validate the RNA-seq 
differential gene expression dataset via NanoString gene 
expression assay. Normalised fold change values between 
the RNA-seq and NanoString platforms show concord-
ance in magnitude directionality (Additional file  5). 
Our previous study also employed the NanoString gene 
expression assay to validate the RNA-seq dataset, and has 
shown similar concordance between the two platforms 
[4].
Discussion
In our previous endeavour [4], the lymph node, spleen, 
and thymus transcriptomes of the Malaysian cynomolgus 
macaque were sequenced via Illumina Hi-seq 2500 tech-
nology. The dataset presented in this study provides addi-
tional transcriptomic sequences from the kidney and 
liver of the Malaysian cynomolgus macaque, with a sum 
of 75,350,240 sequence reads obtained from four tissue 
libraries. In Ee Uli et al. [4], the transcriptome sequences 
were derived from immune-related tissues, whereas the 
kidney and liver transcriptomes generated in this study 
were obtained from metabolism-related tissues, and to 
a certain extent, these tissues also pertain to immune

functions as well. Cynomolgus macaques are utilised 
as NHP models for liver-expressed drug metabolising 
enzyme studies, for example, the pharmacokinetics of 
the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes have been exten-
sively studied in cynomolgus macaques [2, 5, 6].
It was observed that the percentages of the processed 
sequence reads that mapped back to the reference 
genome for all four libraries were below 70%. To rule out 
sequence contamination, we performed a BLAST align-
ment of the unmapped reads to NCBI’s nucleotide (nt) 
database and classified the hits into their specific taxo-
nomic classification. The majority of the unmapped reads 
were assigned to Cercopithecidae and other primate fam-
ily taxa, while the remaining reads were unassigned or 
did not have any BLASTN hits (Additional file 6). This 
suggests the absence of contaminating sequences, and 
also suggests the presence of novel transcripts in the 
kidney and liver dataset of the Malaysian cynomolgus 
macaque, which are yet to be described and curated in 
the M. fascicularis reference genome.
Comparisons were made between the kidney and 
liver tissues due to the similarities in metabolic function 
between the two tissues. However, the specific metabolic 
functions of both kidney and liver tissues are ultimately 
different. For instance, the KEGG pathway enrichment 
analysis highlights 58 liver genes that were specifically 
enriched in the biosynthesis of amino acids pathway, 
while 55 kidney genes were involved in the Inositol phos-
phate metabolism pathway.
Based on the differential gene expression analysis of 
kidney and liver tissues, the top three most upregulated 
genes in liver were PLA2G2A, SAA1, and ORM1, while 
the three most downregulated genes in kidney include 
UMOD, TINAG, and DHDH. The PLA2G2A gene codes 
for phospholipase A2 group IIA, and is suggested to be 
involved in the metabolism of phospholipids, inflam-
matory responses, and antimicrobial defence [7]. SAA1 
codes for the acute-phase serum amyloid A1 protein, and 
is involved in inflammation response [8]. ORM1 codes for 
orosomucoid 1, which is suggested to induce the conver-
sion of monocytes to M2b macrophages in response to 
type 2 cytokines in cancer patients [9]. UMOD codes for

uromodulin, a urinary protein which inhibits the crystal-
lisation of renal fluids that causes renal stone formation, 
and also expedites transepithelial migration of neutro-
phils in inflammation responses [10]. Tubulointerstitial 
nephritis antigen is a glycoprotein coded by TINAG, 
which is a nephritogenic antigen implicated in tubular 
homeostasis and cell survival in the kidney [11]. DHDH 
codes for the enzyme dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, and is 
suggested to be involved in detoxification processes in 
the kidney and liver [12].
In the GO analysis, both kidney and liver transcrip-
tomes were observed to have the majority of genes rep-
resented by the same categories in their respective GO 
domains. In the BP domain, the highly represented cat-
egory was cellular process, while the category with the 
highest gene representation in the MF domain was cata-
lytic activity. As for CC domain, the highest number of 
expressed genes was represented in the cell part category. 
The representation of functional GO categories in the M. 
fascicularis transcriptome were observed to be similar to 
that of other chordates, including that of the silver carp 
[13], pig [14], black grouse [15], and pufferfish [16], and 
suggest a fair representation of the M. fascicularis tran-
scriptome with that of other chordates.
The Malaysian cynomolgus macaque, M. f. fascicula-
ris, is a unique subspecies that is suggested to have high 
nucleotide diversity and is genetically unique compared 
to other South East Asian M. fascicularis populations 
[17–19]. Genetic heterogeneity is suggested to contrib-
ute to varied responses in cynomolgus macaques towards 
drugs and pathogens [20], making research into the 
Malaysian population of cynomolgus macaque invalu-
able to the biomedicine field. The transcriptome data-
set of the Peninsular Malaysian cynomolgus macaque 
obtained from this study can be compared with cynomol-
gus macaques originating from other geographical loca-
tions including Mauritius, the Philippines, Indochina, 
Indonesia, and China. Such comparisons can be utilised 
for the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms in 
the macaque transcriptome, to infer phylogeny utilising 
a larger set of genic sequences, and also to determine 
the nucleotide diversity of the Peninsular Malaysian cyn-
omolgus macaque. Furthermore, the transcriptomic data 
obtained from this study may be utilised to design genic 
molecular markers for rapid assessment of wild popula-
tions of cynomolgus macaques in Peninsular Malaysia in 
a relatively shorter period of time and at a lower cost.
Conclusion
Via the Illumina Hi-seq 2500 platform, 75,350,240 
sequence reads in total were obtained from kidney and 
liver transcriptomes of the wild Peninsular Malaysian 
cynomolgus macaque. Additional sequence reads from 
the Malaysian cynomolgus macaque individuals will 
potentially further supplement the present genomic 
and transcriptomic data of this significant NHP primate 
model.
Limitations
•	 Only two biological replicates were available for 
library construction and data analyses.
•	 RNA sequencing of additional tissues will provide 
more robust transcriptomic dataset of wild Penin-
sular Malaysia M. fascicularis.
