Abstract
For sessile marine invertebrates with complex life cycles, habitat choice is directed by the
larval phase. Defining which habitat-linked cues are implicated in sessile invertebrate larval
settlement has largely concentrated on chemical cues which are thought to signal optimal
habitat. There has been less effort establishing physical settlement cues, including the role
of surface microtopography. This laboratory based study tested whether surface microtopo-
graphy alone (without chemical cues) plays an important contributing role in the settlement
of larvae of coral reef sessile invertebrates. We measured settlement to tiles, engineered
with surface microtopography (holes) that closely matched the sizes (width) of larvae of a
range of corals and sponges, in addition to surfaces with holes that were markedly larger
than larvae. Larvae from two species of scleractinian corals (Acropora millepora and Cte-
nactis crassa) and three species of coral reef sponges (Luffariella variabilis, Carteriospongia
foliascens and Ircinia sp.,) were used in experiments. L. variabilis, A. millepora and C.
crassa showed markedly higher settlement to surface microtopography that closely
matched their larval width. C. foliascens and Ircinia sp., showed no specificity to surface
microtopography, settling just as often to microtopography as to flat surfaces. The findings
of this study question the sole reliance on chemical based larval settlement cues, previously
established for some coral and sponge species, and demonstrate that specific physical
cues (surface complexity) can also play an important role in larval settlement of coral reef
sessile invertebrates.

Introduction
Understanding processes that contribute to distribution patterns of organisms is a cornerstone
of ecology. Indeed, for spatially structured populations, dispersal behaviour and habitat selec-
tion underpins distribution patterns [1]. Moreover, when habitat selectivity is linked to disper-
sive individuals, habitat choices can have implications for Darwinian fitness, particularly in
complex or heterogeneous landscapes [2,3]. Importantly, the selection of suboptimal sites to
settle can be maladaptive in comparison to optimal habitats where opportunities for success
and fitness are highest [2,4].
Habitat selection can revolve around complex behaviours with some taxa demonstrating de-
fined and innate behaviours that optimise selection [5,6]. This is often displayed for breeding
[7], with marine turtles returning to natal beaches to lay eggs [8], brood parasitism in birds
[9,10], and insects using chemical cues to oviposit eggs in habitats that minimise predatory
risks, or optimise food resources for emerging larvae [11] being among the many examples
identifying the use of behaviour to provide optimal habitats for offspring.
Marine sessile invertebrates commonly exhibit complex life cycles with adults occupying a
sessile form while the larval or propagule phase is planktonic. Population distributions can
therefore be moderated by a complex range of processes involving both benthic (adult) and
planktonic (larval) cycles [12,13]. The roles of adult reproduction, larval dispersal and settle-
ment, and juvenile post-settlement success in defining adult distributions and demography are
difficult to disentangle [14]. Nevertheless, adult distributions are primarily directed by the lar-
val phase, thereby highlighting the importance of larval behaviour in habitat selectivity during
dispersal [15] and once larvae engage settlement sites [16].
Chemical (environmental) cues that signal habitat and illicit larval settlement are a common
denominator for a wide range of sessile marine taxa with settlement initiated in response to
conspecifics [17], host organisms [18] and microorganism biofilms [19–21]. Two of the most
interesting chemical cues implicated in the settlement of coral reef invertebrates involve crus-
tose coralline algae (CCA) and microbial biofilms.
CCA are a conspicuous calcifying algae found on shallow (photic zone) coral reefs [22],
where several species of CCA illicit settlement (metamorphosis) responses in a range of sclerac-
tinian corals [23–25], soft corals [26] and sponges [16]. While coral larval settlement in re-
sponse to CCA, and associated microbial biofilms [27,28], has been a focus for coral reef larval
ecologists in recent decades the molecules that induce settlement are largely unidentified
[29,30] preventing it from being universally useful. Moreover, settlement in response to CCA is
observed to be highly variable, and different species of CCA elicit different settlement re-
sponses [31]. Chemical cues associated with microorganism biofilms also contribute to larval
settlement for a wide range of sessile invertebrates, including sponges and corals [20,21,32].
Consistent with settlement responses of coral larvae to CCA, settlement to biofilms can also be
variable for some species [33]. Larval settlement is complex and dynamic, but our incomplete
understanding of settlement processes on coral reefs highlight the need to raise questions
about the sole importance of chemical cues in larval settlement, particularly at the expense of
physical cues such as surface topography.
Compared to chemical cues, the effect of physical microtopography on larval settlement
is less well studied. Surface structure, at topographical scales that approximate larval sizes
(i.e. < 1 mm), is important for some temperate invertebrate larvae, such as barnacles [34–36].
Surfaces structured with crevices of several millimetres have been used in coral and sponge re-
cruitment studies [37–41] but these studies demonstrated settlement to surface topography
that were considerably larger than larval/propagule dimensions. There is considerable knowl-
edge on the role of microtopography in the fields of marine biofouling and bio-mimicry

[42,43] with a predominant focus on determining methods to impede larval settlement. One of
the key findings from this research is that settlement and adhesion of marine invertebrate lar-
vae can be influenced by the complexity of surface microtopography, a concept developed
through “Attachment Point Theory” [44]. If microtopography provides surfaces with texture
that closely match larval dimensions, then settlement is increased by increasing the available
points of attachment for larvae or propagules [45,46]. Conversely, surfaces that are smaller
than larval dimensions minimise the number of attachment points and often reduce settlement
success [44] and the strength of adhesion [47,48].
The broad objective of this study was to explore the premise that there are cues, beyond
those of a chemical nature, that induce larvae to settle, and that physical surface structure is im-
portant. To undertake this we test the hypothesis that surface microtopography contributes to
larval settlement, and that the relationship between the size of surface microtopography and
the size of larvae (Attachment Point Theory) is important for the settlement of larvae of corals
and sponges.
Materials and Methods
Test organisms
Scleractinian (hard) corals often dominate shallow coral reef communities. Sponges can also
form an important component of the coral reef ecosystems. Accordingly, we selected the corals
Acropora millepora and Ctenactis crassa, and the sponges Carteriospongia foliascens, Ircinia
sp., and Luffariella variabilis. A. millepora and L. variabilis were important inclusions because
both species have previously shown strong preferences for settlement to chemical based cues.
A. millepora larvae settle to CCA cues [24] and L. variabilis to conspecific cues [17].
Coral larvae rearing
A. millepora and C. crassa are locally abundant corals found throughout the shallow waters of
the Great Barrier Reef. A. millepora is hermaphroditic and C. crassa is gonochoric. Both species
are broadcast-spawning corals with non-feeding larvae that lack zooxanthellae when released.
Larvae were cultured from three colonies of A. millepora and one female and four male
specimens of C. crassa. All corals were collected from the fringing reefs of Orpheus Island, cen-
tral Great Barrier Reef, two days prior to the full moon in November 2012, transported to Or-
pheus Island Research Station (OIRS), and maintained in flow through aquaria until spawning
occurred in December 2012. Gametes from all A. millepora colonies were collected, combined,
and left for 2 h to fertilize. Eggs of the female C. crassa polyp were collected on the 4th of De-
cember 2012, combined with sperm from 3 male polyps, and left for fertilization for 1.5 hours.
After fertilization, developing embryos were transferred to 500-L aquaria containing 1 μm fil-
tered seawater (FSW). The aquaria were continuously supplied with flow through FSW, at a
flow rate of approximately 2 L min-1. The aquaria were maintained for eight days in a tempera-
ture controlled room at 27C with a 12:12 h light: dark cycle. The majority of larvae showed set-
tlement behaviour (cork-screw like swimming towards bottom of aquaria) at six days after
spawning and were then used in settlement assays.
Sponge larval collection
Luffariella variabilis, Carteriospongia foliascens and Ircinia sp. are brooding dictyoceratid
sponges that are locally abundant within the Great Barrier Reef [49,50]. These three species
dribble spawn parenchymella larvae daily for several weeks during the Austral summer and are
competent to settle within three days of release [17,51,52] (Whalan unpublished data). Up to

10 individual sponges from each species were collected from the fringing reefs of Orpheus Is-
land in December 2012 and transported to OIRS where they were maintained in flow through
aquaria. Larvae were collected by placing mesh traps over sponges following Whalan et al [33],
and immediately used in larval experiments.
Larval sizes
Larval size is important in interpreting the effect that specific sizes of microtopography have
on larval settlement choices. Therefore, 50 larvae from each of the five species were collected at
spawning (sponges), or just prior to use in settlement assays (corals), and fixed in 2.5% glutar-
aldehyde to enable measurements of larval width and length.
Experimental settlement surfaces and design
Artificial surfaces engineered with a range of different sized surface microtopography were
used to test the effect of surface microtopography on larval settlement. Surfaces comprised
50 mm × 50 mm × 5 mm polycarbonate tiles (Makrolon UV, Bayer Material Science). Surface
treatments were prepared by drilling 200 μm deep holes at 400 μm, 700 μm or 1000 μm diame-
ters using a Hartford VMC 1020 numerically controlled mill with Heidenhain controller at a
drill speed of 8000 rpm. Surfaces were designed with a 15 × 15 grid of holes (see Fig. 1a for an
example of 400 μm treatments). The distances between each hole therefore provided an inter-
hole, flat surface. Control surfaces included flat tile surfaces without microtopography, al-
though it is noted that the crevice between the tile and vial also presents a form of microtopo-
graphy, both within controls and all other treatments.
Larval settlement assays for each species were undertaken by pipetting 20 larvae into 20 mL
glass scintillation vials holding 15 mL of 10 μm filtered sea water (FSW), placing the artificial
settlement tile over the opening of the scintillation vial, and carefully inverting the vial so that
larvae were in direct contact with the test surface. Vials were then secured to surfaces with rub-
ber bands and maintained in temperature controlled rooms with 12:12 photo period cycles. A
total of 10 replicate tiles for each of the surface sizes were used for each species. Larval meta-
morphosis was scored every six hours using an inverted microscope. Larval metamorphosis
was scored in both holes and on the flat surface between holes for all surface treatments, and
the flat surface of controls. While we acknowledge there are differences between the terms of
“settlement” and “metamorphosis” [21] for clarity we use the term “settlement” as a descriptor
of the process of larval settlement through to larval metamorphosis from this point on.
Analysis
The effect of surface microtopography on settlement was established with several different
analyses. Firstly, to explore the effect of larval size and settlement to sizes of microtopography
(among all five species) data was analysed using Principal Coordinate Analysis (Primer E). Sec-
ondly, we analysed the effect of surfaces on settlement, treating surface microtopography as a
fixed factor, using one way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Repeated measures ANOVA was
used to analyse the effect of surface microtopography on settlement over time, with time as the
within factor variable and surface treatment as the (fixed) between factor variable. Finally, to
establish if settlement was occurring randomly to holes or non-holes, for each surface microto-
pography treatment, we tested the data against a goodness of fit binomial probability model
(settlement to a hole versus non hole) based on the respective surface areas of holes and no
holes within each tile. Because each tile treatment comprised holes at different diameters the
ratio of surface area between “holes” and “no holes” differed between surface treatments. This
difference was accounted for in the analysis by including the ratio of the surface area taken up

Results
Larval behaviour and sizes
Larvae from species of both corals and sponges exhibited an ovoid shape at release and during
their planktonic phase. Larval behaviours were similar amongst species. During the settlement
phase larvae actively explored surfaces and periodically made contact with a surface for several
seconds, often spending extended durations in holes prior to settlement. In general larvae ex-
hibited a behaviour whereby they rotated on their posterior-anterior pole during settlement
and prior to metamorphosis. Metamorphosis included a transition from a typical larval form
to a flattened disk-like morphology (sponges) or distinctive polyp form (corals) (Fig. 1 a-c).
Given the preference for larvae to commence settlement by rotating on their aboral-oral
axis the relevant metric of larval size in relation to the holes defining the surface microtopogra-
phy is larval width. Mean widths of larvae ranged from 273 μm for the smallest species
(C. crassa) to 504 μm for C. foliascens (Table 1). The range of surface microtopography consti-
tuted surfaces with holes having diameters of 400 μm, 700 μm and 1000 μm. The 400 μm treat-
ment closely resembled larval width for A. millepora, L. variabilis and Ircinia sp., with larger
sized holes (700 μm and 1000 μm) being 200–400 μm larger than the larval widths of all
five species.
Settlement to surface microtopography
A. millepora, C. crassa and L. variabilis larvae showed clear responses of selective settlement to
400 μm holes, whilst the other remaining sponge species, Ircinia sp., and C. foliascens, showed
less specific responses to surface microtopography. This broad trend is clear within the PCA
ordination with C. crassa, L. variabilis, and A. millepora grouping near 400 μm holes (Fig. 2).
In contrast, C. foliascens and Ircinia sp., settlement occurred across the spectrum of
surface microtopographies.
There were significant effects of surface microtopography on larval settlement for the two
coral species, A. millepora and C. crassa, and the sponge L. variabilis at the completion point of
each experiment (Fig. 3 a-b; Fig. 4a, Table 2). For A. millepora, settlement in 400 μm treatments
reached a mean of 20 ± 4.49%, and this sized treatment also corresponded with the mean larval
width of this species (Table 1). There was no settlement of A. millepora in controls. A. millepora
settlement in the 400 μm treatments was significantly higher than larval settlement in 700 μm
(5 ± 1.63%) and 1000 μm (15 ± 4.08%) treatments, both of which showed consistent levels of
settlement (Fig. 3a). There was no settlement of C. crassa to 1000 μm treatments and larval
metamorphosis to both 400 μm (19.44 ± 4.4%) and 700 μm (6.52 ± 1.1%) treatments was

significantly higher compared to control surfaces (2.22 ± 1.22%); noting that the mean larval
width of C. crassa, at 272 μm, was smaller than all hole treatments tested (Fig. 3b; Table 1).
L. variabilis had increased settlement in 400 μm treatments and this size topography closely
matched mean larval width (Table 1). L. variabilis settlement reached 65 ± 5.82% in 400 μm
compared to 35 ± 4.53%, 24.44 ± 3.76 and 32 ± 5.12% in 700 μm, 1000 μm and controls respec-
tively (Fig. 4a).
For the sponges Ircinia sp. and C. foliascens there was no effect of surface treatment on lar-
val settlement. Both these species showed consistent levels of settlement between holes and no-
holes (Table 2; Fig. 4 b-c) irrespective of surface treatments.
Settlement also occurred on the walls of vials, or at the vial-tile interface for all three sponge
species. Settlement to vial walls was highly inconsistent among species, and surface treatments,
and in many instances occurred in a single replicate. These results preclude reliable statistical
analysis beyond reporting a summary of cases where settlement occurred (Table 3). No larval
settlement was recorded on the walls of the vials for the two coral species.
Settlement to surfaces over time
A. millepora, L. variabilis, C. foliascens and Ircinia sp. larvae completed settlement within three
days, and C. crassa settlement occurred over an 11 day period (Fig. 3 a-b, Fig. 4 b-c). A. mille-
pora, C. crassa and L. variabilis larvae all showed significant interactions between time and
treatment effects (A. millepora—Pseudo F 12, 177 = 2.74, p < 0.01; C. crassa—Pseudo F 39,495 =
10.06, p < 0.01; L. variabilis—Pseudo F 5, 210 = 3.73, p < 0.01). Settlement for the remaining

grid fashion engineered into artificial polycarbonate tiles. Settlement choices include “holes” or the “flat
surface between holes”. Settlement to flat surface controls (Cont) is also included. Total variation in the two
principal components is equivalent to 78.9% (PC1 = 43.8% and PC2 = 35.1%).

F 4, 186 = 14.46, p < 0.01; Ircinia sp., Pseudo F 3, 144 = 73.94, p < 0.01), confirming, in part, the
results at the completion point of settlement assays (Fig. 4 b-c).
Settlement: hole versus no hole
The outcome of whether settlement was a reflection of randomly selecting a hole or the flat sur-
faces in between holes varied among species (Fig. 5 a-b, Fig. 6 a-c). A. millepora showed clear
patterns of selectivity for treatments of 400 μm and 700 μm holes with 100% of larval settle-
ment occurring in holes for both these sized treatments (Fig. 5a—no inferential statistics com-
puted). However, for 1000 μm treatments there was no significant difference between
A. millepora settlement to holes or to flat surfaces (Fig. 5a, Binomial test p = 0.09). C. crassa lar-
vae selectively settled in 400 μm holes (Fig. 5b, Binomial test 400; p < 0.01), but showed no pat-
tern of selective settlement in treatments containing larger holes (700 μm and 1000 μm).
L. variabilis also engaged holes to undergo settlement irrespective of surface (size) treatment
(Fig. 6a, Binomial Test 400 μm p < 0.01, 700 μm p < 0.01, 1000 p < 0.01). C. foliascens larvae
showed a significant preference to settle on the flat surfaces of 400 and 700 μm treatments
but no distinction was observed in 1000 μm treatments (Fig. 6b, Binomial Test: 400 & 700 μm,
p < 0.01; 1000 p = 0.09). Ircinia sp. also showed significant biases to settle on flat (inter hole)
surfaces in 400 μm and 700 μm treatments but not in 1000 μm treatments (Fig. 6c, Binomial
Test: 400 p < 0.01; 700 μm p < 0.03; and 1000 μm p = 0.26).

Discussion
The notable outcome of this study was that surface microtopography plays a substantial role in
settlement for some larvae, in part supporting previous studies on corals and sponges that have
established the importance of surface topography in larval recruitment [37–40]. While these
studies demonstrated settlement to surface topography, the surface structures investigated
were considerably larger than dimensions of larvae or propagules. The present study also
showed larvae respond to surface structure, and our focus of matching larval sizes to surface
microtopography reinforces the premise that larvae are more likely to settle to sizes that
closely match their own larval dimensions. This is clearly demonstrated for A. millepora and
L. variabilis, which showed a strong preference to settle in 400 μm holes, with this size hole
closely matching the mean width of both species (434 μm—A. millepora and 391 μm—L. varia-
bilis). Of interest, was the finding that A. millepora did not show any settlement to controls (no
surface topography), and significantly less settlement to 700 μm and 1000 μm holes, these sizes
being over two fold larger than larvae. This trend was also demonstrated for L. variabilis.
While larval settlement to surface microtopography that closely match larval sizes is largely
unexplored for corals and sponges the importance of physical surface cues in larval settlement
has been demonstrated for other taxa, particularly in the biofouling literature [34–36,44,47,53].
Here, there is compelling evidence that larval settlement is influenced according to the points
to which they can adhere; larval settlement is increased with available attachment points and
decreased when attachment points are reduced (i.e. Attachment Point Theory). This theory
was developed from experiments to establish ways to impede larval settlement. However, using
surfaces that match larval dimensions can also optimise settlement [44]. Attachment Point
Theory also supports the findings of this study for A. millepora, L. variabilis, and to a lesser ex-
tent, C. crassa.
The results that both A. millepora and L. variabilis settle to surfaces without chemical-
based-habitat cues are significant. There is a strong focus of work documenting the importance
of the settlement of coral larvae to CCA [23,24]. A. millepora has shown repeated evidence of
settling to CCA, although there are numerous examples that prevent generalisations of CCA
being considered a universal coral larval settlement cue [31]. For example, when CCA is pres-
ent, A. millepora larval settlement in laboratory conditions can vary between 30% to 80% and
appears to be moderated by distinct species of CCA [24,54]. Moreover, some species of CCA
elicit strong responses for some coral species while other CCA species show less convincing ev-
idence as settlement cues [31]. Similarly, L. variabilis has shown increased larval settlement in
the presence of conspecifics [17]. That both L. variabilis and A. millepora respond to chemical
based settlement cues, but nevertheless showed a response to surface structure at a size closely
resembling their larval dimensions, highlights the utility of physical cues and potentially a com-
bined chemical-physical approach. Indeed, our results highlight the complexity and range of
cues implicated in larval settlement. These first results highlight the need for larval settlement
studies to include broader approaches that incorporate both physical and chemical cues. This
is particularly noted for A. millepora, which in the present study showed no settlement to con-
trol surfaces, and in 100% of cases settled to the holes of 400 μm surfaces.
Settlement for two of the sponge species, C. foliascens and Ircinia sp. were in direct contrast
to results for the two coral species, and the sponge L. variabilis. There was no evidence that set-
tlement was optimised with surface microtopography for these two sponges, with settlement
occurring irrespective of the surface treatment. While some sessile invertebrate species have
strict requirements for larval settlement (e.g. death before dishonour- [55]) other taxa show
less specificity and can settle without any apparent cue, particularly as larval competencies de-
crease (e.g. desperate larva hypothesis—[56]). Larvae that do not require specific settlement

cues are arguably afforded advantages if habitat related cues are not encountered, although this
strategy may also result in settlement to unfavourable habitats for these generalist species [57].
Achieving competence in the presence of cues (as for A. millepora and L. variabilis) may also
translate to increased post settlement success by reducing risks associated with latent effects
(i.e. reduced energy to grow-[58]). In this study A. millepora settlement occurred earlier in
400 μm holes in comparison to larger holes. Therefore if latent effects are considered for
A. millepora, larvae encountering and responding to settlement cues early in the pre-settlement
phase may also increase post settlement survival. This should be a focus of further research as
the ability to enhance both settlement and post-settlement survival will positively impact on
concepts such as the sustainable supply of corals for display and public education, as well as for
reef restoration using larval as a seed source.
While this study focused on the role of physical cues it is also important to recognise the
role of chemical cues in larval settlement. The importance of biofilms, for example, cannot be
excluded. Biofilms are likely to have developed on the tiles during the period of the settlement
assays (2–11 days) in the present study and potentially contributed to larval settlement. Despite
this potential, the age of biofilm development also plays a role in levels of larval settlement,
with naive biofilms being less important to larval settlement than mature biofilms [27,32,59].
There are also potential cues associated with plastics associated with settlement tiles used in the
present study. Polycarbonates can emit specific compounds [60] and any resulting effects on
larval settlement of species tested in this study remain undetermined.
In conclusion, this study has established that larval settlement can be driven by physical
(microtopography) settlement cues. It also questions the sole reliance on chemical cues for lar-
vae to settle. While the long term survival of recruits was not a focus of this study, future work
incorporating both chemical and physical cues, coupled with data on post settlement survival
will provide an increased understanding of the dynamics that drive larval settlement
and recruitment.
