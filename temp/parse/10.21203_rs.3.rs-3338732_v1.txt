Abstract
The earliest stages of volcanic vent degradation are rarely measured, leaving a gap in the knowledge that informs landform 
degradation models of cinder cones and other monogenetic vent structures. We documented the initial degradation of 
a 500-m-long spatter rampart at the primary vent of the 2014–2015 Holuhraun eruption in northern Iceland with high-
resolution topographic change maps derived from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and photogrammetric surveys using an 
unoccupied aircraft system (UAS). Topographic differencing shows a total negative volume change of 42,637 ­m3, and a total 
positive volume change (basal deposition) of 10,304 ­m3 (primarily as deposition at the base of steeply sloping surfaces). Two 
distinct styles of volume changes were observed on the interior and exterior of the spatter rampart. Material on the interior of 
the vent was removed from oversteepened slopes by discrete rockfalls, while diffusive processes were qualitatively evident 
on the exterior slopes. We propose a novel conceptual landform evolution model for spatter ramparts that combines rockfall 
processes on the interior walls, diffusive gravitational sliding on the exterior slopes, and incorporates cooling contraction 
and compaction over the entire edifice to describe the observed modes of topographic change during the onset of degrada-
tion. Potential hazards at fresh spatter ramparts are rockfalls at high slope areas of the vent interior walls where contacts 
between spatter clasts are prone to weakening by fumarolic activity, weathering, and settling. To capture such hazards, our 
data suggest a cadence for monitoring changes yearly for the first few years post-eruption, and at longer intervals thereafter.

Introduction
Vent-proximal edifices, such as cinder and spatter cones, 
are characteristic products of monogenetic fissure eruptions. 
Models of cinder and spatter cone erosion have been used to 
estimate the ages of volcanic edifices and recurrence inter-
vals (Wood 1980a, 1980b). However, these estimates rely on 
assumptions about the initial morphology of the edifice and 
its degradation rate (Dohrenwend et al. 1986; Pelletier and 
Cline 2007; Kereszturi et al. 2012; de Vitturi and Arrow-
smith 2013), which can be problematic because direct meas-
urements of the earliest stages of volcanic vent degradation 
are rarely measured (Bemis and Ferencz 2017). Moreover, 
the effects of spatter are not accounted for in the most widely 
used morphometric models, which assume that the structure 
is primarily composed of unconsolidated scoria (e.g. Porter 
1972; Wood 1980a; Hooper and Sheridan 1998; Pelletier and 
Cline 2007). This paper addresses a gap in the knowledge of 
how spatter cones and spatter ramparts degrade within the 
first few years of their history.
To quantify the rates of vent-proximal edifice degrada-
tion, and constrain their causes, we documented time-series 
topographic changes spanning a 5-year period starting 6 
months after the initial emplacement of the main spatter 
rampart at the source of the 2014–2015 Holuhraun erup-
tion in central Iceland. We correlate the spatial distribu-
tion, types, and rates of topographic change with lithologic 
facies to explore how vent edifice construction influences

post-eruption degradation. We investigate factors intrinsic to 
volcanic processes—including agglutination, slope stability, 
subsidence, edifice cooling, and compaction. These obser-
vations inform a conceptual landform evolution model for 
the initial stages of the degradation of spatter ramparts that 
incorporates discrete rockfall events and slope diffusion with 
implications for improving existing models of cinder cone 
evolution (Kereszturi et al. 2012; Fodor and Németh 2015) 
and age estimation (cf. Wood 1980b). Our results also have 
implications for interpreting the morphologies of fissure 
vent edifices on other planetary bodies (Hauber et al. 2009; 
Richardson et al. 2021). Additionally, the ability to relate the 
initial modes and rates of spatter cone or rampart degrada-
tion to emplacement processes and lava facies is relevant 
to hazard assessment by highlighting conditions associated 
with slope failure (González de Vallejo et al. 2020).
Spatter rampart construction
Spatter is a pyroclastic material produced during lava foun-
taining. Spatter deposits form when clots of erupted magma 
are hot enough to be deformable upon impact (Head and 
Wilson 1989; Sumner et al. 2005; Parfitt and Wilson 2009). 
Spatter clasts can stick to each other upon contact, becom-
ing welded to different degrees, in a process called agglu-
tination. If spatter accumulation rates are rapid enough, 
hot material will undergo compaction, thereby becoming 
strongly welded as boundaries between individual clasts to 
merge and become indistinguishable (Sumner et al. 2005). 
Spatter cones, as the name suggests, typically exhibit radial 
symmetry about a vent, whereas more elongated edifices are 
generally referred to as spatter ramparts (Bemis and Ferencz 
2017). Low spatter ramparts may only be a few meters high 
and can form as semi-continuous units parallel to a fissure 
vent (Moore et al. 1980; Parcheta et al. 2012; Valentine et al. 
2017), whereas larger spatter ramparts typically result from 
the coalescence of closely spaced cones that are centered 
along more productive segments of the source fissure (Witt 
et al. 2018).
Eruption characteristics such as lava discharge rate, 
magma gas content, existing topography, and wind speed 
and direction influence the edifice geometry and the strength 
of pyroclastic ramparts (Cas and Wright 2012; Kereszturi 
et al. 2012). While there have been many studies that deal 
with the morphometry of cinder cones (e.g. Segerstrom 
1956; Settle 1979; Wood 1980a, 1980b; Dohrenwend et al. 
1986; Pelletier and Cline 2007; Fornaciai et al. 2010; Bemis 
et al. 2011; Kereszturi et al. 2012; McGuire et al. 2014), 
few have addressed the erosion of spatter-rich vent-proxi-
mal edifices, or the effects of spatter on the erosion of vent-
proximal edifices. During eruptive activity, spatter cones 
may partially collapse, rafting cone material away from the 
vent within clastogenic flows (Holm 1987; Sumner 1998), or 
they may erode after the cessation of the eruption (Swanson 
et al. 1975). Alternatively, welded spatter interbedded with 
scoria can form erosion-resistant layers that slow the ero-
sion rate of cinder cones (Wood 1980b; Dohrenwend et al. 
1986). Steep slopes within the crater, or capping material 
composed mostly of welded spatter, may also collapse as 
rockfalls depositing talus, which is different than erosion 
mechanisms described in models of cinder cone degrada-
tion (Fodor and Németh 2015). It is therefore important to 
correlate the depositional facies of a spatter-rich vent edifice 
with the different modes and rates of degradation.
The 2014–2015 Holuhraun eruption
The Holuhraun basaltic fissure eruption occurred at the 
boundary of the Northern and Eastern Volcanic Zones of 
Iceland (Fig. 1a), and was active from August 28, 2014, to 
February 27, 2015 (Gudmundsson et al. 2014; Sigmunds-
son et al. 2015). Lava fountains erupted along a ~2-km-long 
fissure that formed coincident with a line of cones from a 
previous eruption, also called Holuhraun, that occurred dur-
ing the 1860s (Hartley and Thordarson 2013; Sigmunds-
son et al. 2015). Within the first week of the eruption, lava 
fountaining focused along the fissure to form several cone 
structures (Witt et al. 2018). The eruption emplaced 1.44 
­km3 bulk volume of lava (or 1.2 ­km3 dense rock equivalent; 
Bonny et al. 2018) in a lava flow-field that extends 18 km, 
covering 84 ­km2 (Fig. 1b; Hoskuldsson et al. 2016; Pedersen 
et al. 2017). A large spatter rampart formed along the main 
vent, which became the source for most of the lava emplaced 
during the 6-month eruption (Pedersen et al. 2017; Witt et al. 
2018). The largest of the vent-proximal edifices, called Bau-
gur, is an elongate structure that maintained a lava lake that 
fed the bulk of the Holuhraun lava flow field (Fig. 1c; Eibl 
et al. 2017; Pedersen et al. 2017; Witt et al. 2018). Baugur 
is made up of at least three cones that coalesced along the 
fissure, forming a rampart 500 m long within the first several 
days of the eruption, and ultimately growing to a height of 
~50 m (Witt et al. 2018).
Data and methods
We conducted terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and unoc-
cupied aircraft system (UAS) surveys of the vent region in 
the first five years immediately following the cessation of 
the Holuhraun eruption. From these surveys, we derived a 
time series of high-resolution topography, enabling precise 
measurement of topographic changes. Rates and styles of 
erosion were quantified in change maps derived from topo-
graphic differencing. The processing steps described below 
are illustrated in Fig. S1.

Time series LiDAR surveys
Four TLS surveys were collected during the summers of 
2015, 2016, 2018, and 2019. Each survey consisted of over-
lapping scans from a tripod-mounted Riegl VZ-400 laser 
scanner with a horizontal range of 400 m. TLS surveys 
were generated from individual light detection and rang-
ing (LiDAR) scans geolocated using a Trimble R8 Global 
Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) base station positioned 
along the rim of the vent and a matching R8 rover that was 
mounted on top of the Riegl scanner. GNSS receivers com-
municated during the real-time kinematic (RTK) survey with 
an internal horizontal positioning accuracy of 0.06–1.40 cm 
(Table S1). Individual scans were collected in a 360° cylin-
drical grid pattern with a vertical extent of 100° (30–130° 
from vertical), and an angular separation of laser shots of 
either 0.02° or 0.04°, resulting in a ~4- or ~7-cm point spac-
ing at 100 m range, respectively. Scan positions within the 
study area were spaced approximately every 50 to 70 m to 
acquire overlapping coverage and to minimize obscurations 
due to rugged topography.
Scans of the vent interior, within the vent-proximal chan-
nel, and of the eastern exterior slope of the vent-proximal 
edifice comprise each year’s TLS survey (e.g. Fig. 2a). Point 
clouds from each scan position were registered to each other 
to correct for position errors using a least squares matcher 
on plane patches derived from the point cloud using RiScan 
Pro Multi-Station Adjustment (MSA; Riegl 2013). Scan 
registration offsets were minimized using an iterative clos-
est point (ICP) algorithm (Rusinkiewicz and Levoy 2001; 
Ullrich et al. 2003). The resulting error of these corrections 
is described by the standard deviation of the least squares 
solution for alignment of all scans for a given year, which for 
our scans ranged from 9 to 17 mm (Whelley et al. 2023). In 
addition to the statistics derived from MSA, the quality of the 
solution was validated by visually inspecting the overlapping 
portions of the scan point clouds to ensure that the adjust-
ment computed by the software was physically meaningful 
and correct. Finally, the scans were combined into a single 
point cloud, filtered from the native point density to 2-cm 
spacing, exported in LAS format, and georeferenced to the 
UTM Zone 28N (WGS 84 datum) coordinate system using the 
Point Data Abstraction Library (PDAL Contributors 2018).
Aerial topographic surveys
To expand photographic and topographic coverage of Bau-
gur, aerial surveys were collected concurrently with the 
LiDAR data in 2016, 2018, and 2019 using a Trimble UX5-
HP fixed-wing UAS (Cosyn and Miller 2013) equipped with 
a Sony α7R digital single-lens reflex camera with a 15-mm 
lens. The UAS acquired images at 1–4 cm/pixel from 90 to 
120 m above ground level. Images were precisely georefer-
enced using differential global positioning system (dGPS) 
data collected with an on-board GNSS receiver, inertial 
measurement unit (IMU), and a Trimble R10 base station.

The aerial images were bundle adjusted in the Trimble Busi-
ness Center photogrammetry module to generate 20 cm/
pixel or 12 cm/pixel digital elevation models (DEM) and 4 
cm orthoimage mosaics covering the vent region (Table S1).
Elevation data synthesis
Topographic datasets from TLS and UAS were combined 
into a merged point cloud for 2016, 2018, and 2019 pro-
viding data coverage of the vent region (Fig. 2b–d; Sutton 
et al. 2023). Topographic dataset merging was performed in 
CloudCompare v2.11 (CloudCompare 2021). For each year, 
TLS point clouds were imported into CloudCompare, and 
gridded UAS DEMs were imported as point clouds, where 
each raster pixel defined a vertex in Cartesian space. The 
cloud-to-cloud (C2C) comparison tool within CloudCom-
pare was used to perform a rigid transformation of the UAS 
data to align it to the TLS point cloud. An initial run of 
C2C provided preliminary information about areas where 
topographic changes had likely occurred. Subregions of 
areas where significant topographic changes had occurred 
were masked out. The unmasked regions were run through 
C2C again, resulting in a transformation matrix that was 
then applied to the entire UAS point cloud to bring it into 
alignment with the TLS point cloud. The aligned UAS data 
were then merged with the TLS point clouds to effectively 
fill any gaps of 10 cm or greater in the TLS dataset, preserv-
ing all TLS vertices and extending coverage beyond the TLS 
surveys.
Final merged TLS–UAS point clouds underwent minor 
rotations (<0.5° in X and Y, and <<1° in Z) and translations 
(on the order of a few meters in X, Y, and Z) to co-register 
all point clouds. The merged TLS-UAS point cloud for 2016 
was registered to the 2015 TLS point cloud by default, as the 
2016 TLS point cloud was registered to the 2015 TLS point 
cloud. As the extent of the UAS coverage is much greater 
than the TLS coverage, later point clouds required minor 
shifts to achieve a relative adjustment for 2018 and 2019 to 
match the 2016 merged data.
Relative error in registering each pair of merged point 
clouds was determined by performing a statistical analysis 
of areas where changes were assumed to be minimal. The 
larger areas were primarily located in the terrain outside 
of the vent exterior, which was only covered only by UAS 
data. Small portions of the vent floor that showed minimal 
elevation differences were extracted to include areas with 
LiDAR-only coverage in the error analysis.

As a final processing step, to enable year-over-year vol-
ume change comparisons, points below overhangs were 
removed by removing points >50 cm lower than the maxi-
mum elevation point in a 20-cm planform neighborhood of 
each point. Although these areas constituted a very minor 
part of the topography, and were sparse in the point clouds, 
elevation difference values resulting from these points 
overestimated negative volume changes. These distances 
were determined through visual inspection of point clouds 
in CloudCompare to maximize the identification of under-
hanging surfaces while minimizing the removal of points at 
high-sloped but not overhanging surfaces. Overhang removal 
was necessary to calculate volume change, which assumed 
vertical elevation changes between point clouds were due to 
mass wasting and not complex topography.
Difference quantification
Topographic changes were identified by comparing merged 
point clouds from each year using the CloudCompare plugin 
Multiscale Model to Model Cloud Comparison (M3C2; 
Lague et al. 2013). M3C2 has been successfully used to 
measure topographic changes at landslides (Lague et al. 
2013; James et al. 2017; Williams et al. 2019) and within 
volcanic vents (Hanagan et al. 2020). This method has sev-
eral advantages over other point cloud differencing tools, 
such as C2C. For example, data gaps in either of the two 
point clouds being compared return no data in the M3C2 
difference map, rather than producing an interpolated result. 
For this analysis, elevation differences between the point 
clouds were calculated in the vertical (+Z) direction. We 
used the M3C2 uncertainty value to filter points at high 
uncertainty/low density, which corresponded to overhangs 
and sub-vertical faces where poor UAS coverage provided 
ambiguous topography. A linear filter preserved point den-
sity with low uncertainty and filtered out points with high 
uncertainty.
Topographic changes were expected to be resolvable at or 
below the scale of the meter-sized boulders found through-
out the vent interior. To ensure that measured differences 
were larger than the intrinsic uncertainties in the merged 
point clouds, differences were calculated on a subset of the 
point cloud (M3C2 “core points”) at an effective ground 
sample spacing of 10 cm. Distances between the two point 
clouds were measured within a diameter of 1 m centered on 
normal vectors computed at every core point with a maxi-
mum depth search column of 20 m. The resulting difference 
maps were projected onto the former and latter years’ topog-
raphy to produce two difference maps for each temporal pair. 
For example, the M3C2 differences projected onto the 2015 
topography retained the initial topography before subse-
quent mass wasting events, so the slopes of the “before” 
state could be calculated. The M3C2 differences projected 
onto the latter year’s topography allowed the post-change 
slopes to be calculated. Changes measured in M3C2 were 
compared to elevation and slope. Calculation of topographic 
slope was performed on the point clouds within CloudCom-
pare by calculating normal vectors using a planar fit with a 
1-m diameter, oriented in the +Z direction. Slope was then 
assigned in degrees (0–90°) to each point as a scalar value.
After vertical changes were calculated using M3C2, the 
areal footprints of all points were calculated by producing 
Voronoi diagrams of each study year’s point cloud. Voronoi 
diagrams (Voronoi 1907) are used to calculate tessellated 
polygonal cells centered on points in 2D (or 3D in this case) 
space. The area of each Voronoi polygon was calculated 
and assigned to a central point. As virtually all points are 
assigned a scalar value in M3C2 describing vertical eleva-
tion change, volume change at each point was calculated 
through a trivial multiplication of elevation change and 
polygon area.
Results
We first present an overview of the elevation differences 
over time, spanning Baugur and the immediate vicinity, to 
assess the characteristics of areas where changes do and do 
not occur (“Elevation change time series”). We then perform 
a quantitative assessment of volume changes for the interior 
and exterior of Baugur (“Volume change analysis”). “Exte-
rior” considers the volume changes in exterior portion of 
Baugur. In “Interior”, we present measurements of rockfall 
events on the interior walls. Finally, we correlate rockfall 
distributions over time with lithologic facies in “Correlation 
with lithologic facies.”
Elevation change time series
The elevation difference map output from M3C2 shows areas 
where material has been removed or deposited (Fig. 3). Each 
difference map illustrates the patterns of mass movement, 
showing that discrete areas of negative and positive changes 
dominate the interior, while more diffuse changes of smaller 
magnitude occur on the exterior slopes. Negative elevation 
changes along the rim and exterior slopes of the rampart 
qualitatively appear greatest in the 2016–2018 comparison 
map (Fig. 3b); however, that map encompasses the cumula-
tive differences over 2 years. The cumulative change map 
from 2015 to 2019 captures all changes that can be meas-
ured where only TLS coverage exists (Fig. 3d). Cumulative 
changes across the entire structure and surroundings are 
shown in the 2016–2019 map (Fig. 3e).
An overall decrease in elevation is visible on both the 
eastern exterior slopes (where both TLS and UAS cover-
age exists in 2016–2019) and on the western exterior slopes

(which only was covered in the UAS data). Areas outside of 
the vent (captured in the 2016, 2018, and 2019 UAS data) 
show no significant change. The floor of the vent shows a 
cumulative (2015–2019) negative elevation change of up 
to −0.36 ±0.04 m that is not apparent in the surrounding 
areas adjacent to the vent. The trend in negative elevation 
change along the vent floor is largest at the southern end 
and decreases towards the northern end and channel outlet. 
Cumulative elevation change on the exterior slopes ranges 
from −1.5 ± 0.04 m to 0.27 ± 0.04 m. The largest magnitude 
elevation changes are observed as discrete patches along the 
interior vent walls, likely due to rockfalls and corresponding 
talus deposition. The largest magnitude elevation changes 
from 2015 to 2019 occur within these rockfalls, and range 
from −10.92 m to 9.73 ± 0.04 m.
Volume change analysis
We extracted total volume changes (derived from the ele-
vation change maps) for each time step difference map 
over the area encompassing Baugur. We further divided 
the vent edifice into two subareas: the vent interior and the 
vent exterior (Fig. 3f). The channel forms a break in the 
vent exterior unit where it exits the vent to the northeast. 
The vent interior boundary includes the head of the chan-
nel but does not extend into the channel. The boundary 
was drawn across the channel outlet to include only areas 
that relate to the construction of the spatter rampart. Chan-
nel wall construction was governed by different processes, 
such as levee formation by overbank flows (Lipman and 
Banks 1987), and therefore are not included in this study.

The total sum of volume changes from the interior and 
exterior areas shows the magnitude of the total negative 
change decreasing over the 4-year time span of the study 
(Fig. 4a). Furthermore, the magnitude of the negative 
changes is greater than that of the positive changes. The 
magnitude of positive volume change, however, does not 
show a clear trend; it decreases slightly over the 2016–2018 
timestep, but increases in the 2018–2019 timestep. The 
contribution of the interior and exterior negative volume 
changes is more balanced in 2018–2019 than in other years.
To account for the lower spatial coverage in the 
2015–2016 change map, the sum of volume changes at 
each timestep was normalized by the area of the point 
clouds within each segment (Fig. 4b). Normalized val-
ues show similar trends—the positive changes are sev-
eral times lower than the negative changes, the negative 
changes decrease in magnitude over time, and positive 
changes increase in the 2018–2019 timestep. Normalized 
volume changes show a greater volume loss from the exte-
rior slopes from 2015 to 2016, decreasing to slightly less 
than that of the volume loss over the interior slopes during 
2016–2018. Deposition on the exterior slopes is consist-
ently lower than on interior slopes.
Volume changes derived from the elevation change maps 
show trends with topographic slope and elevation (Fig. 5). The 
exterior slopes show that most deposition occurs on slopes 
<40°. The largest negative and positive volume changes 
on the vent exterior occur over the 20–40° slopes. This is 
expected since the range of slope angles on the exterior is 
predominantly within that range. The negative volume change 
is greater on the exterior slopes during 2015–2016, decreas-
ing during the 2016–2018 period, and then maintaining 
approximately the same rate of change during 2018–2019. 
The positive volume change on the exterior slopes is great-
est in 2018–2019, particularly on slopes from 20 to 40°. The 
interior of the vent shows a volume change distribution that is 
strongly negative at higher slopes with greater positive change 
on lower angle slopes. The greatest positive change in the 
interior is in the 30–40° bin in all years.
Exterior
Over the cumulative time span of 2015–2019, the eleva-
tion along the upper exterior portion of the rampart shows a 
decrease of >1 m compared to the total deposition at the base 
of the exterior slope of <0.2 m (Fig. 6). Volume changes on 
the exterior slopes correlate strongly with elevation and are 
greatest during the first timestep (2015–2016; Fig. 5a, e). 
The correlation with slope (Fig. 5b, f) for the exterior is more 
symmetrical, with the peak negative and positive changes 
occurring in the 30–40° range. This correlation reflects the 
topography, as the mean of the exterior slopes for 2016, 2018, 
and 2019 is 31° with a standard deviation of 11°.
Slope measurements were derived from the merged 
point cloud topography. The exterior surfaces are variable 
in roughness, and therefore at short baselines, slope meas-
urements show some variability. However, there are clear 
correlations with facies and topographic slope. The exterior 
portion of Baugur shows exposures of agglutinated spatter 
along the rim and upper ~1/3 of the rampart. Slopes along 
the upper exterior portion of the rampart measure ~45–55°, 
which is steeper than the static angle of repose for unconsoli-
dated granular material and is at the minimum of the range 
for cohesive material (Beakawi Al-Hashemi and Baghabra

Al-Amoudi 2018). These measurements are consistent with 
our field observations that the material composing the upper 
portion of the rampart is coherent. The surface of the middle 
section of the exterior shows interbedded spatter and scoria, 
with slopes ranging from ~34° down to ~31°. The base of 
the exterior is predominantly loose scoria, and shallows to 
slopes <31° (Fig. 7).

Interior
We identified rockfalls in the vent interior portion of each 
difference map point cloud as discrete patches of negative 
change observed above a corresponding area of positive 
change. The UAS-derived orthomosaics from 2016, 2018, 
and 2019 were used to confirm rockfalls identified in the 
difference maps. Each group of points identified as a rock-
fall was segmented in CloudCompare by identifying the 
negative volume changes bounded by areas of no change. 
The selected 3D points were outlined with a convex hull 
around a best-fit plane and saved as polygons that could 
be projected onto a 2D map (“Correlation with lithologic 
facies”).
Rockfalls generally initiated at higher elevations and on 
oversteepened slopes (Fig. 5b, d), corresponding to areas 
composed of welded spatter deposited during the later 
stages of vent construction (Witt et al. 2018). Most of the 
upper interior slopes have been affected by rockfalls, which 
are observed to reoccur at the same location from year-to-
year. The volumes for all mapped rockfalls range from 0.1 
to 1918.9 ­m3 (Table 1). The volume represented by each 
rockfall patch likely includes multiple events as the tem-
poral resolution of our difference maps only allows for the 
recording of cumulative effects over 1- or 2-year intervals 
(Barlow et al. 2012).
The material released from each rockfall event was 
redistributed on talus slopes built up on top of the lava

tive change near the base. The

ledges and ramps along the interior walls of the vent 
(Fig. 8). Minimal amounts of material from rockfalls 
have reached the vent floor. Patches of light-toned min-
eralization are often visible where wall material has been 
removed by rockfall events (Fig. 8a). Exposed wall mate-
rial remains oversteepened (as of 2019), apparently leav-
ing it prone to future failure as evidenced by the overlap-
ping rockfalls mapped from year-to-year.
Correlation with lithologic facies
We mapped vent facies based on the 2018 UAS data 
produced at 0.04 m/pixel (Fig. 9b). Units were deter-
mined by delineating areas based on slope and roughness 
properties derived from the 2018 topographic model and 
confirmed by interpreting the 2018 orthomosaic. Unit 
descriptions were also informed by our field observations 
(Fig. 10). Agglutinated Spatter corresponds to areas of 
higher roughness and steeper slopes (~36°–50°). Agglu-
tinated Spatter occurs along the rim and upper slopes of 
the vent. Transitional Spatter is interbedded scoria and 
spatter and makes up most of the middle section of the 
outer slopes. The slopes of the Transitional Spatter unit 
range from ~30 to 36°. The base of the exterior is mapped 
as Scoria; the slope angles in the scoria unit are at or near 
the angle of repose for unconsolidated granular material 
(~25–30°; Beakawi Al-Hashimi et al. 2018). The Talus 
unit represents rubbly piles of reddish unconsolidated 
material and primarily occurs along the inner walls of 
Baugur below the Agglutinated Spatter unit. The Talus 
unit does not extend to the floor of the vent. Talus piles 
and rockfalls are a unit that has formed since the end of 
eruptive activity and are a product of vent degradation. 
The Collapsed Lava unit is composed of dark gray slabs 
of the lava crust that remained after the lava drained via 
the northern channel. Flat-lying units adjacent to the base 
of the vent are mapped as Scoria Mantle. Remnant chan-
nels are mapped as Rubbly Pahoehoe (Keszthelyi et al. 
2004; Voigt et al. 2021).
Rockfalls correlate strongly with the Agglutinated Spat-
ter unit (Fig. 9b). Outlines of the mapped rockfall areas are 
projected onto the 2D facies map as polygons (Fig. 9a, b). 
The apparent overlap of polygons from the same year is an 
artifact of the convex hull fit to the 3D points identified for 
each rockfall. The polygons from different years do overlap, 
showing that rockfalls can reoccur in the same location. The 
facies mapping and rockfall mapping were conducted inde-
pendently, lending support to the correspondence of rock-
falls to the Agglutinated Spatter unit. The majority of talus 
from the rockfalls has accumulated on the ledges along the 
interior walls, that thus far has prevented burial and infilling 
of the vent floor.

Discussion
Observations of topographic changes at Baugur over 5 
years reveal that exterior slopes and interior walls degrade 
by different processes. One of the most notable results of 
the difference maps is that volume is not conserved (i.e. 
the negative topographic changes are greater than the posi-
tive topographic changes). This is an unexpected result, 
because material removed by erosion (e.g. via rockfalls or 
gravitational sliding) should be balanced by a corresponding 
positive volume change (deposition). This implies that pro-
cesses other than the downslope movement of material may 
be contributing to the observed negative elevation change. 
To separate the part of the signal due to mass wasting from 
other potential causes of negative elevation change, we first 
balanced the positive and negative total changes by assum-
ing equal mass balance. Ostensibly, the remainder would 
represent negative elevation changes due to non-mass wast-
ing processes.
Negative elevation changes that are not compensated 
by equivalent positive elevation changes could be due to 
physical processes such as graben subsidence, cooling con-
traction, sedimentary compaction, and/or aeolian deflation. 
We have adjusted for uncertainty within our topographic 
data to a minimum level by only measuring changes larger 
than the estimated errors. The resulting percentage of the 
negative changes not balanced by positive volume change is 
82.7% for 2015–2016, 85.1% for 2016–2018, and 38.3% for 
2018–2019 (Table 2).
It is not possible to measure or model every factor that 
could contribute to the observed excess negative topo-
graphic change, but we do consider data processing arti-
facts (“Data uncertainties”), graben subsidence (“Graben 
subsidence”), and thermal contraction (“Thermal contrac-
tion”). In “Rockfalls,” we examine changes in the rates and 
magnitudes of rockfalls on the interior of Baugur. In “Land-
form evolution synthesis,” we discuss how observed erosion 
processes could be incorporated into landform evolution 
models for volcanic vent edifices.
Data uncertainties
Errors in the merging and relative registration of the year-
to-year point clouds could contribute to the apparent mass 
imbalance. However, if the larger negative elevation change 
was solely due to the merging of the LiDAR and UAS data 
sets, it would be unlikely to appear in the western slopes of 
the exterior, which were not sampled in the LiDAR surveys. 
The negative elevation change signal does, in fact, appear 
on both the east and west-facing slopes. The flat-lying ter-
rain surrounding the vent, which was mostly covered only 
by the UAS data, does not display a strong negative signal;

those areas tend to have a mean difference in the M3C2 
difference maps that is slightly positive (~0.01 m). Minor 
photogrammetric artifacts appear in the surrounding ter-
rain, but their contribution is accounted for in the error level 
measured for each difference map (Table 2). Other artifacts 
result from the difference quantification, which overcounts 
positive value volume changes, particularly at oversteepened 
slopes of overhangs where the M3C2 search depth param-
eter unavoidably overshoots the intended reference surface. 
The choice of the M3C2 parameters, particularly the depth 
search parameter, was a tradeoff between being able to accu-
rately capture the largest negative changes on steep slopes 
and inadvertently counting complex surfaces as positive 
changes (“Difference quantification”). Thus, data uncer-
tainties cannot account for the observed excessive negative 
volume change.
Graben subsidence
Baugur is situated along the western fault boundary of a 
graben (Hjartardóttir et al. 2015; Kolzenburg et al. 2021). 
Subsidence due to drainback of magma along the dike may 
seem like a candidate factor in the overall lowering of Bau-
gur after the end of the eruption. Graben formation above 
the dike that sourced the Holuhraun flow was marked by 
an elevation drop of ~3–4 m between parallel fault lines.

This drop occurred during the initial stages of the erup-
tion, and thereafter did not exhibit a significant lowering 
in repeat surveys up to the summer of 2019 (Kolzenburg 
et al. 2021). Ongoing graben subsidence therefore seems 
unlikely to be a major contributing factor to the negative 
elevation change observed. However, apparent subsidence 
of the edifice could be due to other causes, such as com-
paction due to thermal contraction and/or settling.
Thermal contraction
The signal of negative change is confined to the vent edifice, 
implying a shallow mechanism, such as thermal contraction. 
In studies of the cooling contraction of lava flows (Wittman 
et al. 2017) and pyroclastic deposits (Whelley et al. 2012), 
thermal contraction was modeled to derive rates of subsid-
ence. To investigate the potential magnitude of volume loss 
at Baugur, we estimate volumetric change due to cooling, 
and compare the estimates to the difference measurements.
The change in volume for an unconstrained material can 
be estimated to first order simply by multiplying the initial 
volume, V, by a factor describing the material's response 
to thermal changes, α, and the change in temperature, dT 
(Turcotte and Schubert 2014; p. 204),
Similarly, when considering just the change in height 
(dZ), the formula can be written as
 where the scaling coefficient, γ, would be 1 for the 1D lin-
ear function (as in Eq. 1), and 3 for the case where the only 
volumetric contraction is in the height direction (Wittman 
et al. 2017). However, as the vent edifice is not a slab of 
constant thickness, and the actual change is likely in three 
dimensions, we use an intermediate value for γ = 1.7, based 
on Chaussard (2016), where γ = (1 + ν)/(1 − ν), and ν is Pois-
son’s ratio of 0.25. Our results from the topographic dif-
ferencing measured elevation changes (dZ), from which we 
calculated volume changes (dV). For the purposes of com-
paring the potential contribution of thermal contraction to 
the overall elevation changes (Fig. 6), we can estimate to an 
order of magnitude what the potential contribution of cool-
ing might be to elevation (height, Z) changes, using Eq. (2), 
with γ = 1.7, to obtain a factor that describes a percentage 
change. The magnitude of the thermal response of basalt 
can vary depending on density, vesicularity, temperature, 
and composition (Richter and Simmons 1974). For the coef-
ficient of thermal expansion of basalt, α, we use 8.30 × ­10−6 
­K−1, derived from laboratory measurements of Icelandic 
basalts from the Hekla volcano, which included samples of 
various porosity over a range of temperatures comparable to 
(1)
dV = V × 훼× dT.
(2)
dZ = Z × 훾훼× dT,
the situation at Baugur (Wittman et al. 2017). The choice for 
dT relies on assumptions based on observations of the initial 
and final temperatures of the edifice spanning the time of 
our observations. We observed completely welded deposits 
lower in the vent and agglutinated spatter along the upper 
portion and rim, implying that deposition temperatures were 
hot enough for clasts to be deformable and sticky, but were 
lower than the eruption temperature. The deposition tem-
perature can be estimated to be near the glass transition tem-
perature of 725 °C (Ryan and Sammis 1981). When com-
pletely cooled, the solidified lava would be at the ambient air 
temperature. Although the surface was cool enough to walk 
on at least as early as six months after the end of the erup-
tion (i.e. at the time of our initial survey), fumarolic activity 
was observed during each year of our surveys, implying that 
subsurface temperatures in at least some portions of Baugur 
were at least 100 °C as late as 2019. Although tempera- 
tures of up to 1195 °C were measured during the 2014–2015 
eruption (Kolzenburg et al. 2017), we conservatively bracket 
the range of dT for the welded clasts with a maximum of 
725 °C – 0 °C = 725 °C, to a minimum of 725 °C–100 °C 
= 625 °C. We find that the maximum estimated elevation 
change due to cooling contraction is −0.07 m if the material 
cooled completely to ambient temperature. The more realistic 
value for dT, 625 °C, yields a maximum elevation change of 
−0.06 m. These estimates compare reasonably well to the 
observed average decrease in elevation of a few tens of cen-
timeters over the ~50 m height of the rampart, demonstrating 
that thermal contraction is likely to be responsible for roughly 
50% of the observed negative elevation changes (Fig. 11).
Compaction may also contribute to observed volume 
changes due to settling of unconsolidated tephra or by degas-
sing of residual clastogenic melt within the edifice (Whel-
ley et al. 2012; Chaussard 2016). Nonetheless, the role of 
thermal contraction is expected to play an important role in 
observed volume changes and may serve as a catalyst for 
mass wasting as cooling causes the development of fine-
scale contraction joints that weaken steep welded spatter, 
thereby enhancing gravitational instability and increasing 
the likelihood of rockfalls. As new surfaces are exposed by 
rockfalls, it is also possible that the cooling processes that 
form cracks may be migrating deeper into the edifice, propa-
gating instabilities into the edifice.
Rockfalls
The number of cataloged rockfall events decreases only 
slightly from year-to-year, while the total volume and maxi-
mum size rockfall both decrease more dramatically. Rock-
fall total volumes decrease from 7110 ­m3 in 2015–2016 to 
5028 ­m3 over 2016–2018 (2 years) to 1247 ­m3 in 2018–2019 
(Table 1). It is probable that each mapped rockfall event

represents the cumulative effect of multiple smaller events, 
as they were not observed in real time (Hovius et al. 1997; 
Barlow et al. 2012). Even so, the overall trend of decreas-
ing rockfall volume implies that the relative contribution 
of smaller events is increasing in time. This implication is 
borne out in the complementary cumulative distribution 
function (CCDF) of rockfall data for each timestep (Fig. 12) 
that shows the scaling value (β) of the power law fit is >1 
in absolute magnitude (Barlow et al. 2012). The power law 
fit is only applied to volumes greater than a calculated cut-
off value using the method of Clauset et al. (2009). Visual 
inspection of the CCDF shows that using the power law fit to 
extrapolate to larger volumes could overestimate the likeli-
hood of larger magnitude events occurring in the future as 
the fit to the distribution is not well correlated at the larger 
end of the data set. The apparent threshold for what would be 
considered a good fit at the larger end of the distribution is 
~200 ­m3 within the first three years, and ~70 ­m3 in the fourth 
year. The similarity of the plots for the first two time steps 
(2015–2016 and 2016–2018, spanning the first three years), 
and the marked difference thereafter indicates some physical 
process changed resulting in a decrease of the largest rockfall 
volumes. The reduction in rockfall magnitude may be an 
effect of diminishing supply of available material at exposed 
over-steepened surfaces (i.e. the largest volumes collapsed 
within the first 3 years, reducing the available amount of 
gravitationally unstable material), or talus is gradually bury-
ing the exposed wall faces, which naturally buttresses the 
exposed, if still oversteepened walls, or it may be a combina-
tion of both factors.

We observe that rockfalls scars remain over-steepened 
and that rockfalls can reoccur at the same locations (Fig. 9). 
In many cases, rockfall scars appear to expose bright min-
eral deposits left by fumarolic activity (Fig. 8a; Achilles 
et al. 2019). This apparent correlation may be explained by 
fumarolic activity degrading the rock strength by hydrother-
mal alteration (Darmawan et al. 2022). Weakly agglutinated 
spatter contacts in the material deposited in the upper por-
tion of the vent edifice may also be prone to degradation 
due to fumarolic activity, promoting collapse where there is 
already instability due to over-steepened slopes (cf. Hanagan 
et al. 2020). It is likely that rockfalls will continue as long as 
there are gravitationally unstable surfaces available, suggest-
ing the value of continued monitoring to identify ongoing 
hazards.
Landform evolution synthesis
Our observations of Baugur indicate that spatter-rich edifices 
degrade by different modes than are described by the land-
form evolution models for cinder cones, which assume that 
diffusion is the dominant degradation process (Wood 1980b; 
Pelletier and Cline 2007). Ideal diffusive processes would be 
expected to show a signature of balanced positive change 
(deposition) as non-cohesive material moves from higher 
to lower elevations, resulting in the gradual shallowing of 
slopes (Pelletier and Cline 2007). In reality, volume may not 
be conserved locally. For example, some loss of volume may 
be expected due to aeolian removal. Fornaciai et al. (2010) 
noted a deficit in the volume of deposited material of up to 
75% of the volume eroded from the upper exterior slopes of 
Etnean cinder cones, which they attributed to wide dispersal 
by wind, with lack of agglutination noted as a contributing 
factor. We observed that downslope movement of unconsoli-
dated material on the edifice exterior was hindered by the 
presence of spatter along the upper portion of the edifice. 
However, slight deposition was observed at the exterior base, 
due to the downslope movement of scoria from the middle 
and lower slopes (Fig. 7).
The more striking divergence from the diffusive degrada-
tion model occurs on the interior of the vent edifice. Over 
time, rockfalls along the vent interior walls convert coherent 
pyroclastic deposits (agglutinated spatter) into unconsoli-
dated material. Yet this material forms relatively large (tens 
of centimeter to ~1 m), highly angular clasts that form stable 
talus deposits (Fig. 10a) which were not prone to further 
downslope movement during the first 5 years. Downslope 
movement of talus in the vent interior may progress in a 
two-stage process such that initial deposition occurs onto the 
ledges by talus until it reaches the angle of repose, at which 
point material can advance further downslope and begin 
infilling the crater floor. It may be that once the accommo-
dation space on the ledges is filled, talus will be deposited on 
the vent floor. However, we did not observe any significant 
accumulation of material on the floor of the vent during the 
five years after the eruption ceased. Additional topographic 
surveys, potentially spaced at intervals of ~5 years, would 
be necessary to confirm this prediction.
The magnitude of elevation change at rockfall locations 
was on the order of a few meters, with cumulative change 
from 2015 to 2019 up to 11 m in some areas. As the wall 
material was removed, the rim retreated horizontally and 
vertically by up to ~3 m in places (Fig. 13a). The upper 
interior walls maintained oversteepened slopes, rather than 
developing into gradually shallower slopes. Over a longer 
time span, the cumulative effects of episodic interior rock-
falls may resemble a more diffusive process (Fig. 13b), but 
on short timescales (<5 years), they may primarily represent 
the products of discrete events that have not reached sta-
tistical equilibrium. Our observations suggest that a hybrid 
model would better describe the modes of degradation 
that occur during the earliest stages of evolution of spatter 
ramparts.
Conclusions
We documented the initial stages of degradation of the pri-
mary vent (Baugur) of the 2014–2015 Holuhraun eruption 
in northern Iceland, finding that up to 24,710 ­m3 of mate-
rial was eroded from the interior walls and 17,927 ­m3 was 
removed from the exterior slopes, for a total volume loss 
of 42,637 ­m3 over the period from 2015 to 2019. Positive 
volume change (deposition) in the vent interior was 8108 
­m3, and on the exterior 2196 ­m3 was deposited for a total of 
10,304 ­m3. Volume changes are a result of two distinct styles 
of erosion. Material in the interior of the vent is removed 
from oversteepened slopes by discrete rockfalls, burying the 
ledges below in talus. Minimal material had accumulated 
on the floor of the vent 5 years after the cessation of the 
eruption (Figs. 10c,d and 13b). Diffusive processes are quali-
tatively evident on the edifice exterior in the topographic 
change maps, but measurements are below the estimated 
level of uncertainty. Material is hindered from eroding from 
the rim and upper portions of the exterior slopes by a cap-
ping rim of cohesive spatter deposits and interbedded spat-
ter and cinders. We estimate that bulk contraction due to 
cooling could contribute to a maximum of a few tens of 
centimeters decrease in elevation. However, cooling con-
traction alone cannot fully explain the observed imbalance 
in the negative volume changes. Other mechanisms such as 
compaction-induced settling of the edifice and/or aeolian 
transport and deflation are required to explain the mass bal-
ance change over the edifice.
We propose a conceptual landform evolution model that 
combines stochastic rockfall processes on the interior walls,

diffusive gravitational sliding on the portions of exterior 
slopes where unconsolidated scoria exists, and that also 
incorporates cooling contraction and compaction over the 
entire edifice to better describe the observed modes of deg-
radation the earliest stages of evolution of spatter ramparts, 
or spatter-rich scoria cones. The occurrence of discrete mass 
wasting events trends towards smaller magnitude events, 
possibly evolving to more diffusive processes. Our observa-
tions support a model where the vent diameter widens rela-
tively quickly after the eruption ceases, inviting comparison 
to models of impact craters and other steeply sloped, gravita-
tionally unstable landforms in the Solar System (Fassett and 
Thomson 2014; Fassett et al. 2017). Our conceptual model 
fills a gap in landform evolution models for volcanic vents 
both in terms of the composition (spatter-rich) and in the 
description of processes occurring during the very earliest 
stages of degradation.
Potential hazards at Baugur and similar fresh volcanic 
vents primarily impact visitors (e.g. tourists, researchers, 
and park staff) hiking in and around the vent area. Collapses 
along the crater rim and rockfalls inside the vent are the 
greatest hazards that we identified in the data presented 
here. The difference maps show clearly that rockfall events 
occurred each year and can reoccur at previous rockfall 
locations. Areas of steep slopes are prone to gravitational 
instability, particularly as the contacts between welded spat-
ter clasts degrade due to a combination of factors including 
thermal contraction, weathering, fumarolic activity, and set-
tling. The areas with the highest erosion rates correlated to 
the highest elevations (i.e. along the rim). Talus deposits 
appear to be stable and less prone to further mass wasting. 
The temporal span of this study is not sufficient to make reli-
able predictions about the ongoing hazard potential. How-
ever, the data can be used to inform the cadence of repeat 
surveys that would be sufficient to adequately monitor the 
evolution of spatter ramparts or similar vent edifices, such 
as annual surveys conducted for the first few years, followed 
by repeat surveys at longer intervals thereafter.
