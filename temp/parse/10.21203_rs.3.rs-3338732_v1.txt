We documented the initial degradation of a 500 m long spatter rampart at the primary vent of the 2014-2015 Holuhraun eruption in northern Iceland with high resolution topographic change maps derived from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and photogrammetric surveys using an unoccupied aircraft system (UAS).  Topographic differencing shows a total negative volume change of 55,687 m 3 , and a total positive volume change (basal deposition) of 9,640 m 3 .  Two distinct styles of volume changes were observed on the interior and exterior of the spatter rampart.  Material on the interior of the vent was removed from oversteepened slopes by discrete rockfalls, while diffusive processes were qualitatively evident on the exterior slopes.  We propose a novel conceptual landform evolution model for spatter ramparts that combines rockfall processes on the interior walls, diffusive gravitational sliding on the exterior slopes, and incorporates cooling contraction and compaction over the entire edifice to describe the observed modes of topographic change during the onset of degradation.  Potential hazards at fresh spatter ramparts are rockfalls at high slope areas of the vent interior walls where contacts between spatter clasts are prone to weakening by fumarolic activity, weathering, and settling.  To capture such hazards, our data suggest a cadence for monitoring changes yearly for the first few years post-eruption, and at longer intervals thereafter. 



    Introduction Vent-proximal edifices, such as cinder and spatter cones, are characteristic products of monogenetic fissure eruptions.  Models of cinder and spatter cone erosion have been used to estimate the ages of volcanic edifices and recurrence intervals (Wood 1980a  (Wood , 1980b)) .   However, these estimates rely on assumptions about the initial morphology of the edifice and its degradation rate (Dohrenwend et al. 1986;  Pelletier and Cline 2007;  Kereszturi et al. 2012;  Vitturi and Arrowsmith 2013) , which can be problematic because direct measurements of the earliest stages of volcanic vent degradation are rarely measured  (Bemis and Ferencz 2017) .   Moreover, the effects of spatter are not accounted for in the most widely used morphometric models, which assume that the structure is primarily composed of unconsolidated scoria (e.g.  Porter 1972;  Wood 1980a;  Hooper and Sheridan 1998;  Pelletier and Cline 2007) .   This paper addresses a gap in the knowledge of how spatter cones and spatter ramparts degrade within the first few years of their history. 

 To quantify the rates and constrain the causes of vent-proximal edifice degradation, we created a time-series of topographic changes spanning a five-year period starting six months after the initial emplacement of the main spatter rampart at the source of the 2014-2015 Holuhraun eruption in northern Iceland.  We correlate the spatial distribution, types, and rates of topographic change with lithologic facies to explore how vent edifice construction influences post-eruption degradation.  We investigate factors intrinsic to volcanic processes-including agglutination, slope stability, subsidence, edifice cooling, and compaction.  These observations inform a conceptual landform evolution model for the initial stages of the degradation of spatter ramparts that incorporates discrete rockfall events and slope diffusion with implications for improving existing models of cinder cone evolution (Kereszturi et al. 2012;  Fodor and Németh 2015) and age estimation (cf.   Wood 1980b) .   Our results also have implications for interpreting the morphologies of fissure vent edifices on other planetary bodies (Hauber et al. 2009;  Richardson et al. 2021) .  

 Additionally, the ability to relate the initial modes and rates of spatter cone or rampart degradation to emplacement processes and lava facies is relevant to hazard assessment by highlighting conditions associated with slope failure (González de Vallejo et al. 2020 ).  



 Spatter rampart construction Spatter is a pyroclastic material produced during lava fountaining.  Spatter deposits form when clots of erupted magma are hot enough to be deformable upon impact (Head and Wilson 1989;  Parfitt and Wilson 2008;  Sumner et al. 2005) .   Spatter clasts can stick to each other upon contact, becoming welded to different degrees, in a process called agglutination.  If spatter accumulation rates are rapid enough, hot material will undergo compaction, thereby becoming strongly welded as boundaries between individual clasts to merge and become indistinguishable (Sumner et al. 2005) .   Spatter cones, as the name suggests, typically exhibit radial symmetry about a vent, whereas more elongated edifices are generally referred to as spatter ramparts (Bemis and Ferencz 2017) .   Low spatter ramparts may only be a few meters high and can form as semi-continuous units parallel to a fissure vent (Moore et al. 1980;  Parcheta et al. 2012;  Valentine et al. 2017) , whereas larger spatter ramparts typically result from the coalescence of closely spaced cones that are centered along more productive segments of the source fissure  (Witt et al. 2018) .  

 Eruption characteristics such as lava discharge rate, magma gas content, existing topography, and wind speed and direction influence the edifice geometry and the strength of pyroclastic ramparts (Cas and Wright 1988;  Kereszturi et al. 2012) .   While there have been many studies that deal with the morphometry of cinder cones (e.g.  Segerstrom 1956;  Settle 1979;  Wood 1980a  Wood 1980b;;  Dohrenwend 1986;  Pelletier and Cline 2007;  Fornaciai et al. 2010;  Bemis et al. 2011;  Kereszturi et al. 2012;  McGuire et al. 2014) , few have addressed the erosion of spatter-rich vent-proximal edifices, or the effects of spatter on the erosion of vent-proximal edifices.   During eruptive activity, spatter cones may partially collapse, rafting cone material away from the vent within clastogenic flows (Holm 1987;  Sumner 1998) , or they may erode after the cessation of the eruption  (Swanson et al. 1975) .   Alternatively, welded spatter interbedded with scoria can form erosion-resistant layers that slow the erosion rate of cinder cones (Wood 1980b;  Dohrenwend et al. 1986) .   Steep slopes within the crater or capping material composed mostly of welded spatter may also collapse as rockfalls depositing talus, which is different than erosion mechanisms described in models of cinder cone degradation (Fodor and Németh 2015) .   It is therefore important to correlate the depositional facies of a spatter-rich vent edifice with the different modes and rates of degradation. 



 The 2014-2015 Holuhraun Eruption The Holuhraun basaltic fissure eruption occurred in the Northern Volcanic Zone of Iceland, and was active from August 28, 2014  , to February 27, 2015  (Gudmundsson et al. 2014;  Sigmundsson et al. 2015) .   Lava fountains erupted along a ~2-km-long fissure that formed coincident with a line of cones from a previous eruption, also called Holuhraun, that occurred during the 1860s (Hartley and Thordarson 2013;  Sigmundsson et al. 2015) .   Within the first week of the eruption, lava fountaining focused along the fissure to form several cone structures (Witt et al. 2018 ).   The eruption emplaced 1.44 km 3 bulk volume of lava (or 1.2 km 3 dense rock equivalent; Bonny et al. 2018 ) in a lava flowfield that extended 18 km, covering 84 km 2  (Hoskuldsson et al. 2016;  Pedersen et al. 2017) .   A large spatter rampart formed along the main vent, which became the source for most of the lava emplaced during the six-month eruption (Pedersen et al. 2017;  Witt et al. 2018) .   The largest of the vent-proximal edifices, called Baugur, is an elongate structure that maintained a lava lake that fed the bulk of the Holuhraun lava flow field (Eibl et al. 2017;  Pedersen et al. 2017;  Witt et al. 2018) .   Baugur is made up of at least three cones that coalesced along the fissure, forming a rampart 500 m long within the first several days of the eruption, and ultimately growing to a height of ~50 m (Witt et al. 2018) .  



 Data and Methods We conducted terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and unoccupied aircraft system (UAS) surveys of the vent region in the first five years immediately following the cessation of the Holuhraun eruption.  From these surveys we derived a time series of high-resolution topography, enabling precise measurement of topographic changes.  Rates and styles of erosion were quantified in change maps derived from topographic differencing. 



 Time series of LiDAR surveys Four TLS surveys were collected during the summers of 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2019 .   Each survey consisted of overlapping scans from a tripod-mounted Riegl VZ-400 laser scanner with a horizontal range of 400 m.  TLS surveys were generated from individual light detection and ranging (LiDAR) scans geolocated using a Trimble R8 Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) base station positioned along the rim of the vent and a matching R8 rover that was mounted on top of the Riegl scanner.  GNSS receivers communicated during the real-time kinematic (RTK) survey with an internal horizontal positioning accuracy of 0.06-1.40  cm.  Individual scans were collected in a 360° cylindrical grid pattern with a vertical extent of 100° (30°-130° from vertical), and an angular separation of laser shots of either 0.02° or 0.04°, resulting in a ~4 or ~7 cm point spacing at 100 m range, respectively.  Scan positions within the study area were spaced approximately every 50 to 70 m to acquire overlapping coverage and to minimize obscurations due to rugged topography. 

 Scans of the vent interior, within the vent-proximal channel, and of the eastern exterior slope of the ventproximal edifice comprise each year's TLS survey (e.g.  Fig. 2 .a).   Point clouds from each scan position were registered to each other to correct for position errors using a least squares matcher on plane patches derived from the point cloud using RiScan Pro Multi-Station Adjustment (MSA).  Scan registration offsets were minimized using an iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm (Rusinkiewicz and Levoy 2001;  Ullrich et al. 2003) .   The resulting error of these corrections is described by the standard deviation of the least squares solution for alignment of all scans for a given year, which for our scans ranged from 9-17 mm (Whelley et al. 2023 ).   In addition to the statistics derived from MSA, the quality of the solution was validated by visually inspecting the overlapping portions of the scan point clouds to ensure that the adjustment computed by the software was physically meaningful and correct.  Finally, the scans were combined into a single point cloud, filtered from the native point density to 2-cm spacing, exported in LAS format, and georeferenced to the UTM Zone 28N (WGS 84 datum) coordinate system using the Point Data Abstraction Library (PDAL Contributors 2020). 



 Aerial topographic surveys To expand photographic and topographic coverage of Baugur, aerial surveys were collected in 2016, 2018, and 2019 using a Trimble UX5-HP fixed-wing UAS (Cosyn and Miller 2013) equipped with a Sony α7R digital singlelens reflex camera with a 15 mm lens.   The UAS acquired images at 1-4 cm/pixel from 90-120 m above ground level. 

 Images were precisely georeferenced using differential global positioning system (dGPS) data collected with an onboard GNSS receiver, inertial measurement unit (IMU), and a Trimble R10 base station.  The aerial images were bundle adjusted in the Trimble Business Center photogrammetry module to generate 20 cm/pixel or 12 cm/pixel digital elevation models (DEM) and 4 cm orthoimage mosaics covering the vent region. 



 Elevation data synthesis Topographic datasets from TLS and UAS were combined into a merged point cloud for 2016, 2018 and 2019 providing data coverage of the vent region (Fig.  2 .b-d;  Sutton et al 2023) .   Topographic dataset merging was performed in CloudCompare v2.11 (CloudCompare 2021).  For each year, TLS point clouds were imported into CloudCompare, and gridded UAS DEMs were imported as point clouds, where each raster pixel defined a vertex in Cartesian space.  The cloud-to-cloud (C2C) comparison tool within CloudCompare was used to perform a rigid transformation of the UAS data to align it to the TLS point cloud.  An initial run of C2C provided preliminary information about areas where topographic changes had likely occurred.  Subregions of areas where significant topographic changes had occurred were masked out.  The unmasked regions were run through C2C again, resulting in a transformation matrix that was then applied to the entire UAS point cloud to bring it into alignment with the TLS point cloud.  The aligned UAS data were then merged with the TLS point clouds to effectively fill any gaps of 10 cm or greater in the TLS dataset, preserving all TLS vertices and extending coverage beyond the TLS surveys.  Final merged TLS-UAS point clouds underwent minor rotations (<0.5° in X and Y, and <<1° in Z) and translations (on the order of a few meters in X, Y, and Z) to co-register all point clouds.  The merged TLS-UAS point cloud for 2016 was registered to the 2015 TLS point cloud by default, as the 2016 TLS point cloud was registered to the 2015 TLS point cloud.  As the extent of the UAS coverage is much greater than the TLS coverage, later point clouds required minor shifts to achieve a relative adjustment for 2018 and 2019 to match the 2016 merged data. 

 Relative error in registering each pair of merged point clouds was determined by performing a statistical analysis of areas where changes were assumed to be minimal.  These areas are primarily covered only by UAS data. 

 Small portions of the vent floor that showed minimal elevation differences were extracted to include areas with LiDAR-only coverage in the analysis. 

 As a final processing step, to enable year-over-year volume change comparisons, overhangs in the point clouds were removed.  This was performed by removing points >50 cm lower than the maximum elevation point in a 20-cm planform neighborhood of each point.  These distances were determined through visual inspection of point clouds in CloudCompare to maximize the identification of underhanging surfaces while minimizing the removal of points at high-sloped but not overhanging surfaces.  Overhang removal was necessary to calculate volume change, which assumed vertical elevation changes between point clouds were due to mass wasting and not complex topography. 



 Difference quantification Topographic changes were identified by comparing merged point clouds from each year using the CloudCompare plugin Multiscale Model to Model Cloud Comparison (M3C2; Lague et al. 2013 ).   M3C2 has been successfully used to measure topographic changes at landslides (Lague et al. 2013;  James et al. 2017;  Williams et al. 2019 ) and within volcanic vents  (Hanagan et al. 2020) .   This method has several advantages over other point cloud differencing tools, such as C2C.  For example, data gaps in either of the two point clouds being compared return no data in the M3C2 difference map, rather than producing an interpolated result.  For this analysis, elevation differences between the point clouds were calculated in the vertical (+Z) direction.  We used the M3C2 uncertainty value to filter points at high uncertainty/low density, which corresponded to overhangs and sub-vertical faces where poor UAS coverage provided ambiguous topography.  A linear filter preserved point density with low uncertainty and filtered out points with high uncertainty. 

 Detectable topographic changes were expected to be at or below the scale of the meter-sized boulders found throughout the vent interior.  Differences were calculated on a subset of the point cloud (M3C2 "core points") at an effective ground sample spacing of 10 cm, the value chosen to minimize measuring TLS scan position differences rather than actual topographic change.  Distances between the two point clouds were measured within a diameter of 1 m centered on normal vectors computed at every core point with a maximum depth search column of 20 m.  The resulting difference maps were projected onto the former and latter years' topography to produce two difference maps for each temporal pair.  For example, the M3C2 differences projected onto the 2015 topography retained the initial topography before subsequent mass wasting events, so the slopes of the "before" state could be calculated.  The M3C2 differences projected onto the latter year's topography allowed the post-change slopes to be calculated.  Changes measured in M3C2 were compared to elevation and slope.  Calculation of topographic slope was performed on the point clouds within CloudCompare by calculating normal vectors using a planar fit with a 1 m diameter, oriented in the +Z direction.  Slope was then assigned in degrees (0°-90°) to each point as a scalar value. 

 After vertical changes were calculated using M3C2, the areal footprints of all points were calculated by producing Voronoi diagrams of each study year's point cloud.  Voronoi diagrams (Voronoi 1907 ) are used to calculate tessellated polygonal cells centered on points in 2D (or 3D in this case) space.   The area of each Voronoi polygon was calculated and assigned to a central point.  As virtually all points are assigned a scalar value in M3C2 describing vertical elevation change, volume change at each point was calculated through a trivial multiplication of elevation change and polygon area. 



 Results We first present an overview of the elevation differences over time, spanning Baugur and the immediate vicinity, to assess the characteristics of areas where changes do and do not occur ( §3.1).  We then perform a quantitative assessment of volume changes for the interior and exterior of Baugur ( §3.2).  Section 3.3 considers the volume changes in exterior portion of Baugur.  In Section 3.4, we present measurements of rockfall events on the interior walls.  Finally, we correlate rockfall distributions over time with lithologic facies in Section 3.5. 



 Elevation change time series The elevation difference maps output from M3C2 show areas where material has been removed or deposited (Fig. 3 ).   Each difference map illustrates the patterns of mass movement, showing that discrete areas of negative and positive changes dominate the interior, while more diffuse changes of smaller magnitude occur on the exterior slopes. 

 Negative elevation changes along the rim and exterior slopes of the rampart qualitatively appear greatest in the 2016-2018 comparison map (Fig. 



 3.e). An overall decrease in elevation is visible on both the eastern exterior slopes (where TLS and UAS coverage both exist in 2016-2019) and on the western exterior slopes (which only was covered in the UAS data).  Areas outside 



 Volume change analysis We extracted total volume changes (derived from the elevation change maps) for each time step difference map over the area encompassing Baugur.  We further divided the vent edifice into two subareas: the Vent Interior and the Vent Exterior (Fig. 3f ).   The channel forms a break in the Vent Exterior unit where it exits the vent to the northeast. 

 The Vent Interior boundary includes the head of the channel but does not extend into the channel.  The boundary was drawn across the channel outlet to include only areas that relate to the construction of the spatter rampart.  Channel wall construction was governed by different processes, such as levee formation by overbank flows (Lipman and Banks 1987) , and therefore are not included in this study.  

 The total sum of volume changes from the Interior and Exterior areas shows the magnitude of the total negative change decreasing over the four-year time span of the study (Fig. 4a ).   Furthermore, the magnitude of the negative changes is greater than that of the positive changes.  The magnitude of positive volume change, however, In general, volume changes decrease in magnitude from year-to-year.  On the interior, more negative changes occur on higher slopes, with greater positive changes on lower slopes, indicating mass movement from the higher to lower 



 Exterior Over the cumulative time span of 2015-2019, the elevation along the upper exterior portion of the rampart shows a decrease of >1 m compared to the total deposition at the base of the exterior slope of <0.2 m (Fig. 6 ).   Volume changes on the exterior slopes correlate strongly with elevation and are greatest during the first timestep (2015-2016; Fig. 5a,  e ).   The correlation with slope (Fig. 5b,  f ) for the exterior is more symmetrical, with the peak negative and positive changes occurring in the 30°-40° range.   This correlation reflects the topography, as the mean of the exterior slopes for 2016, 2018, and 2019 is 31° with a standard deviation of 11°. 



 Interior We identified rockfalls in the vent interior portion of each change map point cloud as discrete patches of negative change observed above a corresponding area of positive change.  The UAS-derived orthomosaics from 2016, 2018 and 2019 were used to confirm rockfalls identified in the difference maps.  Each group of points identified as a rockfall was segmented in CloudCompare by identifying the negative volume changes bounded by areas of no change. 

 The selected 3D points were outlined with a convex hull around a best-fit plane and saved as polygons that could be projected onto a 2D map ( §3.5). 

 Rockfalls generally initiated at higher elevations and on oversteepened slopes (Fig. 5 .b,d), corresponding to areas composed of welded spatter deposited during the later stages of vent construction  (Witt et al. 2018) .   Most of the upper interior slopes have been affected by rockfalls, which are observed to reoccur at the same location from yearto-year.  The volumes for all mapped rockfalls range from 0.1 m 3 to 1,918.9 m 3 (Table 1 ).   The volume represented by each rockfall patch likely includes multiple events as the temporal resolution of our difference maps only allows for the recording of cumulative effects over one-or two-year intervals (Barlow et al. 2012) .  

 The material released from each rockfall event is redistributed on talus slopes built up on top of the lava ledges and ramps along the interior walls of the vent (Fig. 8 ).   Minimal amounts of material from rockfalls have reached the vent floor.  Patches of light-toned mineralization are often visible where wall material has been removed by rockfall events (Fig. 8a ).   Exposed wall material remains oversteepened, apparently leaving it prone to future failure as evidenced by the overlapping rockfalls mapped from year-to-year. 



 Correlation with lithologic facies We mapped vent facies based on the orthomosaic from the 2018 UAS data produced at 0.04 m/pixel (Fig. Talus piles and rockfalls are a unit that has formed since the end of eruptive activity and are a product of vent degradation.  The Collapsed Lava unit is composed of dark gray slabs of the lava crust that remained after the lava drained via the northern channel.  Flat-lying units adjacent to the base of the vent are mapped as Scoria Mantle. 

 Remnant channels are mapped as Rubbly Pahoehoe (Keszthelyi et al. 2004;  Voigt et al. 2021) .  

 Rockfalls correlate strongly with the Agglutinated Spatter unit (Fig. 



 Discussion Observations of topographic changes at Baugur over five years reveal that exterior slopes and interior walls degrade by different processes.  One of the most notable results of the difference maps is that volume is not conserved (i.e. the negative topographic changes are greater than the positive topographic changes).  This is an unexpected result, because material removed by erosion (e.g. via rockfalls or gravitational sliding) should be balanced by a corresponding positive volume change (deposition).  This implies that processes other than the downslope movement of material may be contributing to the observed negative elevation change.  To separate the part of the signal due to mass wasting from other potential causes of negative elevation change, we first balanced the positive and negative total changes by assuming equal mass balance.  Ostensibly, the remainder would represent negative elevation changes due to non-mass wasting processes. 

 Negative elevation changes that are not compensated by equivalent positive elevation changes could be due to physical processes such as graben subsidence, cooling contraction, sedimentary compaction, and/or aeolian deflation.  We have adjusted for uncertainty within our topographic data to a minimum level by only measuring changes larger than the estimated errors.  The resulting percentage of the negative changes not balanced by positive volume change is 90.6% for 2015  -2016  , 84.5% for 2016  -2018  , and 38.3% for 2018  -2019 (Table 2) (Table 2) .  

 It is not possible to measure or model every factor that could contribute to the observed excess negative topographic change, but we do consider data processing artifacts ( §4.1), graben subsidence ( §4.2) and thermal contraction ( §4.3).  In Section 4.4, we examine changes in the rates and magnitudes of rockfalls on the interior of Baugur.  In Section 4.5, we discuss how observed erosion processes could be incorporated into landform evolution models for volcanic vent edifices, and in Section 4.6 we explore implications of this study for future monitoring of fresh spatter ramparts. 



 Data uncertainties Errors in the merging and relative registration of the year-to-year point clouds could contribute to the apparent mass imbalance.  However, if the larger negative elevation change was solely due to the merging of the LiDAR and UAS data sets, it would be unlikely to appear in the western slopes of the exterior, which were not sampled in the LiDAR surveys.  The negative elevation change signal does, in fact, appear on both the east and west-facing slopes. 

 The flat-lying terrain surrounding the vent, which was mostly covered only by the UAS data, does not display a strong negative signal; those areas tend to have a mean difference in the M3C2 difference maps that is slightly positive (~0.01 m).  Minor photogrammetric artifacts appear in the surrounding terrain, but their contribution is accounted for in the error level measured for each difference map (Table 2 ).   Other artifacts result from the difference quantification, which overcounts positive value volume changes, particularly at oversteepened slopes of overhangs where the M3C2 search depth parameter unavoidably overshoots the intended reference surface.  The choice of the M3C2 parameters, particularly the depth search parameter, was a tradeoff between being able to accurately capture the largest negative changes on steep slopes and inadvertently counting complex surfaces as positive changes ( §2.4).  Thus, data uncertainties cannot account for the observed excessive negative volume change. 



 Graben subsidence Baugur is situated along the western fault boundary of a graben (Hjartardóttir et al. 2015;  Kolzenburg et al. 2021) .   Subsidence due to drainback of magma along the dike may seem like a candidate factor in the overall lowering of Baugur after the end of the eruption, but graben formation above the dike that sourced the Holuhraun flow was marked by an elevation drop of ~3-4 m between parallel fault lines.  This drop occurred during the initial stages of the eruption, and thereafter did not exhibit a significant lowering in repeat surveys up to the summer of 2019 (Kolzenburg et al. 2021) .   Ongoing graben subsidence therefore seems unlikely to be a major contributing factor to the negative elevation change observed.  However, apparent subsidence of the edifice could be due to other causes, such as compaction due to thermal contraction and/or settling. 



 Thermal contraction The signal of negative change is confined to the vent edifice, implying a shallow mechanism, such as thermal contraction.  In studies of the cooling contraction of lava flows (Wittman et al. 2017) and pyroclastic deposits (Whelley et al. 2012) , thermal contraction was modeled to derive rates of subsidence.   To investigate the potential magnitude of volume loss at Baugur, we estimate volumetric change due to cooling, and compare the estimates to the difference measurements. 

 The change in volume for an unconstrained material can be estimated to first order simply by multiplying the initial volume, V, by a factor describing the material's response to thermal changes, , and the change in temperature, dT (Turcotte and Schubert 2002;  p. 204) .  

 𝑑𝑉 = 𝑉 × 𝛼 × 𝑑𝑇 (1)   Similarly, when considering just the change in height (dZ), the formula can be written as 

 𝑑𝑍 = 𝑍 × 𝛾𝛼 × 𝑑𝑇 (2)   where the scaling coefficient, , would be 1 for the 1D linear function (as in Eqn.  1), and 3 for the case where the only volumetric contraction is in the height direction (Wittman et al. 2017 ).   However, as the vent edifice is not a slab of constant thickness, and the actual change is likely in three dimensions, we use an intermediate value for = 1.7, based on Chaussard (2016) , where = (1 + )/(1 -), and is Poisson's ratio of 0.25.   Our results from the topographic differencing measured in elevation changes (dZ), from which we calculated volume changes (dV).  For the purposes of comparing the potential contribution of thermal contraction to the overall elevation changes (Fig. 6 ), we can estimate to an order of magnitude what the potential contribution of cooling might be to elevation (height) changes, using Eqn.   ( 2 ), with = 1.7, to obtain a factor that describes a percentage change.   The magnitude of the thermal response of basalt can vary depending on density, vesicularity, temperature, and composition (Richter and Simmons 1974).  For the coefficient of thermal expansion of basalt, , we use 8.30 × 10 -6 K -1 , derived from laboratory measurements of Icelandic basalts from the Hekla volcano, which included samples of various porosity over a range of temperatures comparable to the situation at Baugur (Wittman et al. 2017) .   The choice for relies on assumptions based on observations of the initial and final temperatures of the edifice.  At Holuhraun, the measured eruption temperature was 1195 °C (Kolzenburg et al. 2017) .   We observed completely welded deposits lower in the vent, and agglutinated spatter along the upper portion and rim, implying that deposition temperatures were hot enough for clasts to be deformable and sticky, but were lower than the eruption temperature.  The deposition temperature can be estimated to be near the glass transition temperature of 725 °C (Ryan and Sammis 1981) .   When completely cooled, the solidified lava would be at the ambient temperature.  Although the surface was cool enough to walk on at least as early as six months after the end of the eruption, ongoing fumarolic activity implies that subsurface temperatures in at least some portions of Baugur were at least 100 °C as late as 2019.  We therefore bracket the range of dT from a maximum of 725 °C -0 °C = 725 °C, to a minimum of 725° -100° = 625 °C.  We find that the maximum estimated elevation change due to cooling contraction is -0.07 m if the material cooled completely to ambient temperature.  The more realistic value for dT, 625 °C, yields a maximum elevation change of -0.06 m.  These estimates compare reasonably well to the observed average decrease in elevation of a few tens of centimeters over the ~50 m height of the rampart, demonstrating that thermal contraction is likely to be responsible for roughly 50% of the observed negative elevation changes (Fig. 10 ).  

 Compaction may also contribute to observed volume changes due to settling of unconsolidated tephra or by degassing of residual clastogenic melt within the edifice (Whelley et al. 2012;  Chaussard 2016) .   Nonetheless, the role of thermal contraction is expected to play an important role in observed volume changes and may serve as a catalyst for mass wasting as cooling causes the development of fine-scale contraction joints that weaken steep welded spatter, thereby enhancing gravitational instability and increasing the likelihood of rockfalls.  As new surfaces are exposed by rockfalls, it is also possible that the cooling processes that form cracks may be migrating deeper into the edifice, propagating instabilities into the edifice. 



 Rockfalls The number of cataloged rockfall events decreases only slightly from year-to-year, while the total volume and maximum size rockfall both decrease more dramatically.  Rockfall total volumes decrease from 7,110 m 3 in 2015-2016 to 5,028 m 3 over 2016-2018 (two years), to 1,247 m 3 in 2018-2019 (Table 1 ).   It is probable that each mapped rockfall event represents the cumulative effect of multiple smaller events, as they were not observed in real time (Hovius et al. 1997;  Barlow et al. 2012) .   Even so, the overall trend of decreasing rockfall volume implies that the relative contribution of smaller events is increasing in time.  This implication is borne out in the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of rockfall data for each timestep (Fig. 11 ) that shows the scaling value (β)  

 of the power law fit is >1 in absolute magnitude (Barlow et al. 2012) .   The power law fit is only applied to volumes greater than a calculated cutoff value using the method of Clauset et al. (2009) .   Visual inspection of the CCDF shows that using the power law fit to extrapolate to larger volumes could overestimate the likelihood of larger magnitude events occurring in the future as the fit to the distribution is not well correlated at the larger end of the data set.  The apparent threshold for what would be considered a good fit at the larger end of the distribution is ~200 m 3 within the first three years, and ~70 m 3 in the fourth year.  The similarity of the plots for the first two time steps (2015-2016 and 2016-2018 , spanning the first three years), and the marked difference thereafter indicates some physical process changed resulting in the decrease the largest rockfall volumes.   The reduction in rockfall magnitude may be an effect of diminishing supply of available material at exposed over-steepened surfaces (i.e. the largest volumes collapsed within the first three years, reducing the available amount of gravitationally unstable material), or talus is gradually burying the exposed wall faces, which naturally buttresses the exposed, if still oversteepened walls, or it may be a combination of both factors. 

 We observe that rockfalls scars remain over-steepened, and that rockfalls can reoccur at the same locations (Fig. 9 ).   In many cases, rockfall scars appear to expose bright mineral deposits left by fumarolic activity (Fig. 8a ;  et al. 2019 ).   This apparent correlation may be explained by fumarolic activity degrading the rock strength by hydrothermal alteration (Darmawan et al. 2022) .   Weakly agglutinated spatter contacts in the material deposited in the upper portion of the vent edifice may also be prone to degradation due to fumarolic activity, promoting collapse where there is already instability due to over-steepened slopes (cf.  Hanagan et al. 2020) .  

 Achilles 

 Landform evolution synthesis Landform evolution models for cinder cones typically assume that diffusion is the dominant degradation process (Wood, 1980b, Pelletier and  Cline, 2007) .   Diffusion of unconsolidated material from higher to lower elevations by gradual mass movement downslope is nonlinearly related to slope angle (Pelletier and Cline 2007) .  

 Diffusive processes would be expected to show a signature of balanced positive change (deposition) as non-cohesive material moves from higher to lower elevations (Pelletier and Cline 2007) .   In reality, volume may not be conserved locally.  For example, some loss of volume may be expected due to aeolian removal.  Fornaciai et al. (2010) noted a deficit in the volume of deposited material of up to 75% of the volume eroded from the upper exterior slopes of Etnean cinder cones, which they attributed to wide dispersal by wind, with lack of agglutination noted as a contributing factor.  

 Our observations suggest that downslope movement of unconsolidated material on the exterior slopes is hindered by the presence of spatter along the upper portion of the edifice.  However, there is some deposition at the exterior base, due to the downslope movement of scoria from the middle and lower slopes (Fig. 7 ).  

 Over time, rockfalls along the vent interior walls convert coherent pyroclastic deposits (agglutinated spatter) into unconsolidated material.  The magnitude of elevation change at rockfall locations is on the order of a few meters, with cumulative change from 2015-2019 up to 11 m in some areas.  As the wall material is removed, the rim has retreated horizontally and vertically by up to ~3 m in places (Fig. 12a ).   Talus accumulates below the rim, approaching the angle of repose for unconsolidated material.  The upper walls retreat horizontally but maintain oversteepened slopes. 

 Downslope movement of talus in the vent interior may progress in a two-stage process such that initial deposition occurs onto the ledges by talus until it reaches the angle of repose, at which point material can advance further downslope and begin infilling the crater floor.  Although we did not observe any significant accumulation of material on the floor of the vent during the five years after the eruption ceased, it may be that once the accommodation space on the ledges is filled, talus will be deposited on the vent floor.  The mobility of the talus is not well quantified in our data, other than once emplaced, it did not show further downslope movement.  Over a longer time span, the cumulative effects of episodic interior rockfalls may resemble a more diffusive process (Fig. 12b ).   Our observations suggest that a hybrid model would better describe the modes of degradation that occur during the earliest stages of evolution of spatter ramparts, rather than a model that relies solely on diffusion. 



 Conclusions We documented the initial stages of degradation of the primary vent (Baugur) of the 2014-2015 Holuhraun eruption in northern Iceland, finding that up to 27,540 m 3 of material was eroded from the interior walls and 28,147 m 3 was removed from the exterior slopes, for a total volume loss of 55,687 m 3 over the period from 2015-2019. 

 Positive volume change (deposition) in the vent interior was 8,004 m 3 , and on the exterior 1,636 m 3 was deposited for a total of 9,640 m 3 .  Volume changes are a result of two distinct styles of erosion.  Material in the interior of the vent is removed from oversteepened slopes by discrete rockfalls, burying the ledges below in talus.  Minimal material had accumulated on the floor of the vent five years after the cessation of the eruption.  Diffusive processes are qualitatively evident in the topographic change maps, but measurements are below the estimated level of uncertainty.  Material is hindered from eroding from the rim and upper portions of the exterior slopes by a capping rim of cohesive spatter deposits and interbedded spatter and cinders.  We estimate that bulk contraction due to cooling could contribute to a maximum of a few tens of centimeters decrease in elevation.  However, cooling contraction alone cannot fully explain the observed negative volume changes.  Other mechanisms such as compaction-induced settling of the edifice and/or aeolian transport and deflation are required to explain the mass balance change over the edifice. 

 We propose a conceptual landform evolution model that combines stochastic rockfall processes on the interior walls, diffusive gravitational sliding on the portions of exterior slopes where unconsolidated scoria exists, and that also incorporates cooling contraction and compaction over the entire edifice to better describe the observed modes of degradation the earliest stages of evolution of spatter ramparts, or spatter-rich scoria cones.  The occurrence of discrete mass wasting events trends towards smaller magnitude events, possibly evolving to more diffusive processes. 

 Our observations support a model where the vent diameter widens relatively quickly after the eruption ceases, inviting comparison to models of impact craters and other steeply sloped, gravitationally unstable landforms in the Solar System (Fassett and Thomson 2014;  Fassett et al. 2017) .  

 Potential hazards at Baugur and similar fresh volcanic vents primarily impact visitors (e.g.  tourists, researchers, and park staff) hiking in and around the vent area.  Collapses along the crater rim and rockfalls inside the vent are the greatest hazards that we identified in the data presented here.  The difference maps show clearly that rockfall events occurred each year and can reoccur at previous rockfall locations.  Areas of steep slopes are prone to gravitational instability, particularly as the contacts between welded spatter clasts degrade due to a combination of factors including weathering, fumarolic activity, and settling.  The areas with the highest erosion rates are correlated with the highest elevations (i.e.  along the interior and exterior of the rim).  Talus slopes appear to be stable and less prone to further mass wasting.  The temporal span of this study is not sufficient to make reliable predictions about the ongoing hazard potential.  However, the data can be used to inform the cadence of repeat surveys that would be sufficient to adequately monitor the evolution of spatter ramparts or similar vent edifices, such as annual surveys conducted for the first few years, followed by repeat surveys at longer intervals thereafter.

     does not show a clear trend; it decreases slightly over the 2016-2018 timestep, but increases in the 2018-2019 timestep.  The contribution of the interior and exterior negative volume changes is more balanced in 2018-2019 than in other years.  To account for the lower spatial coverage in the 2015-2016 change map, the sum of volume changes at each timestep was normalized by the area of the point clouds within each segment (Fig. 4b).  Normalized values show similar trends-the positive changes are several times lower than the negative changes, the negative changes decrease in magnitude over time, and positive changes increase in the 2018-2019 timestep.  Normalized volume changes show a greater volume loss from the exterior slopes from 2015-2016, decreasing to slightly less than that of the volume loss over the interior slopes during 2016-2018.  Deposition on the exterior slopes is consistently lower than on interior slopes.

     9b) . .  Units were determined by interpreting the images and by delineating areas based on slope and roughness properties derived from the 2018 topographic model.  Agglutinated Spatter corresponds to areas of higher roughness and steeper slopes (~36°-50°).  Agglutinated Spatter occurs along the rim and upper slopes of the vent.  Transitional Spatter is interbedded scoria and spatter and makes up most of the middle section of the outer slopes.  The slopes of the Transitional Spatter unit range from ~30º-36º.  The base of the exterior is mapped as Scoria; the slope angles in the scoria unit are at or near the angle of repose for unconsolidated granular material (~25°-30°; Beakawi Al-Hashimi et al. 2018).  The Talus unit represents rubbly piles of reddish unconsolidated material and primarily occurs along the inner walls of Baugur below the Agglutinated Spatter unit.  The Talus unit does not extend to the floor of the vent. 



     9.b).  Outlines of the mapped rockfall areas are projected onto the 2D facies map as polygons (Fig. 9.a,b).  The apparent overlap of polygons from the same year is an artifact of the convex hull fit to the 3D points identified for each rockfall.  The polygons from different years do overlap, showing that rockfalls can reoccur in the same location.  The facies mapping and rockfall mapping were conducted independently, lending support to the correspondence of rockfalls to the Agglutinated Spatter unit.  The majority of talus from the rockfalls has accumulated on the ledges along the interior walls, that thus far has prevented burial and infilling of the vent floor.
