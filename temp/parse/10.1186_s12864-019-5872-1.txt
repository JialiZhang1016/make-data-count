Abstract
Background: Genetic diversity within a species reflects population evolution, ecology, and ability to adapt.
Genome-wide population surveys of both natural and introduced populations provide insights into genetic
diversity, the evolutionary processes and the genetic basis underlying local adaptation. Grass carp is the most
important freshwater foodfish species for food and water weed control. However, there is as yet no overall picture
on genetic variations and population structure of this species, which is important for its aquaculture.
Results: We used 43,310 SNPs to infer the population structure, evidence of local adaptation and sources of
introduction. The overall genetic differentiation of this species was low. The native populations were differentiated
into three genetic clusters, corresponding to the Yangtze, Pearl and Heilongjiang River Systems, respectively. The
populations in Malaysia, India and Nepal were introduced from both the Yangtze and Pearl River Systems. Loci and
genes involved in putative local selection for native locations were identified. Evidence of both positive and balancing
selection was found in the introduced locations. Genes associated with loci under putative selection were involved in
many biological functions. Outlier loci were grouped into clusters as genomic islands within some specific genomic
regions, which likely agrees with the divergence hitchhiking scenario of divergence-with-gene-flow.
Conclusions: This study, for the first time, sheds novel insights on the population differentiation of the grass carp,
genetics of its strong ability in adaption to diverse environments and sources of some introduced grass carp
populations. Our data also suggests that the natural populations of the grass carp have been affected by the
aquaculture besides neutral and adaptive forces.

Background
Genetic diversity is a central concept of evolutionary biol-
ogy and molecular ecology, and plays an important role in
the complexity of organisms, ecosystem recovery and the
ability of a species to adapt diverse environmental condi-
tions [1, 2]. Investigation on adaptive divergence in associ-
ation with the pattern of gene flow can advance our
understanding of speciation genomics [3, 4]. Adaptive
divergence in response to extreme environmental vari-
ables is able to be maintained and the flanking regions
can expand due to physical linkage, resulting in reduction
of gene flow [3]. Thus, genetic divergence can be accumu-
lated in the form of ‘divergence hitchhiking’ even in the
background of high gene flow [5]. Alternatively, genome-
wide divergence caused by selection per se can also hinder
gene flow at the whole genome level, leading to further
genetic divergence in the form of ‘genome hitchhiking’
[3]. Discrimination between the two patterns of ‘diver-
gence-with-gene-flow’ can enhance our knowledge of spe-
ciation and also the underlying evolutionary forces [3, 4].
Genomic surveys of natural populations provide essential
information on gene flow, genetic variation and adaptive
divergence, as well as biogeographic history of species [6].
Populations with recent introduction history typically
have experienced founder effects due to a small number
of introduced individuals. With small effective sizes, these
populations are more vulnerable to random genetic drift
during the early stages of the introduction [7]. These evo-
lutionary forces in combination with directional selection

can cooperatively contribute to the decrease of genetic
diversity and reduce the success of introduction [8].
Nevertheless, advantageous genetic diversity can still be
maintained by a variety of selective regimes [9]. Genetic
loci of higher genetic diversity under balancing selection
are crucial to the survival of introduced populations dur-
ing adaptation to new environments [9]. Identifying these
loci and understanding the genes associated with these
loci in local adaptation can help in designing novel strat-
egies for managing biological invasions and minimizing
the damage caused by non-native species [10]. In another
aspect, investigation on the source populations and intro-
duction routes of introduced populations is also valuable
in understanding the evolutionary forces on adaptation in
correlation to environmental factors [10]. Such informa-
tion can help in designing practices for utilizing intro-
duced resources in both breeding programs and biological
control [11].
The grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) is the most
important freshwater foodfish species as well as a species
for aquatic vegetation control [12], providing an excellent
opportunity to study the interactions between the above
evolutionary forces and genomic variations. The grass carp
is native to eastern Asia and broadly distributed from the
Heilongjiang River System (Amur River) southward to
northern Vietnam [12]. Within its native distribution
range, grass carp mainly lives in three independent river
systems: Heilongjiang, Yangtze and Pearl [12]. Aquaculture
of grass carp is mainly conducted within the geographical
regions of the Yangtze and Pearl River Systems [13]. Its an-
nual global production has been over five million tons
since 2013 [13]. In China, the grass carp has been cultured
for over 1300 years [12, 13]. Previous studies based on
microsatellites showed that genetic differentiation between
distant native locations was low, but statistically significant
[14–17]. Further, considering the long culture history and
extensive aquaculture practices, as well as the isolation by
long geographic distance, the contemporary population
structure of native grass carp likely has been influenced to
some extent by the aquaculture. With a wide range of
distribution, grass carps are under the pressure from
spatially divergent selection, corresponding to heterozy-
gous environments. Its distribution spans approximately
30 latitudinal degrees. Some environmental variables vary
along latitude (e.g., extreme temperature from 0° to 38 °C)
[12]. Thus, the pattern of adaptive variations at the loci as-
sociated with such environmental variables likely presents
a signature of latitudinal gradient.
The grass carp has been introduced to over 80 coun-
tries for aquaculture and for controlling the water weeds
[13, 18]. The earliest introduction of the grass carp was
documented from Southern China to Malaysia in the
1800s [18]. However, the exact place of origin of the
most introduced grass carp populations is unclear.
Previous studies inferred that grass carps introduced to
the USA, Europe and Japan most likely had multiple ori-
gins [16, 19]. However, no studies on tracing the origins
of grass carps introduced to the other regions were re-
ported. In comparison to the native populations, intro-
duced grass carps in USA, Europe and Japan have
reduced genetic variability and showed significant diver-
gence [16, 19], but adapted to the new habitats very well
[18]. In some species, although having experienced sig-
nificant founder effects, the potential for adaptive diver-
gence in such populations was maintained [10]. Loci
showing higher genetic diversity resulting from balan-
cing selection may play more important roles in main-
taining the survival of introduced species than the loci
under positive selection in the background of loss of
genetic diversity [9]. However, there is no genome-wide
information about the genetic variations in induced
grass carp populations.
The purposes of this study were to analyze the genetic
variations and to identify signatures of local selection in
the native and introduced locations in the grass carp
using genome-wide SNPs genotyped by using genotyping
by sequencing (GBS). A total of 197 grass carp from six
native and three introduced locations were genotyped
with 43,310 SNPs. Our study, for the first time, sheds
insights on genetic diversity, population structure, local
adaption and sources of introduced grass carps, which
could be useful in the aquaculture of the grass carp.
Methods
Sampling and data collection
A total of 197 grass carp individuals from six native and
three introduced locations were collected between 2007
and 2008. The six native sampling sites were in the
Heilongjiang, Yangtze and Pearl River Systems. The three
sampling sites for introduced grass carp were located in
Malaysia, India and Nepal, respectively (Additional file 8:
Table S1 & Additional file 1: Figure S1). The annual aver-
age and peak temperatures of each sampling site were re-
trieved from the National Meteorological Center of China
(http://www.nmc.cn) and were highly correlated (Mantel
test, R2 = 0.98 and P < 0.001). Thus, only annual average
temperature was used for further analysis (Additional
file 8: Table S1). The Malaysian location was docu-
mented as being introduced in the 1800s from southern
China, while the Indian location was recorded as being
introduced from Hong Kong, China (the Pearl River
System), in 1959 and 1968 [20]. The Nepalese location
was set up by introduction from India in 1966–1967 [18].
All samples were estimated as more than one year old. Fin
tissue of each fish was collected and preserved in 95%
ethanol at −20 °C. Genomic DNA was isolated using
DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Germany) and quan-
tified using Qubit® assays (Life Technologies, USA).

Genotyping by sequencing
Genotyping by sequencing (GBS) was conducted using the
ddRAD-Seq approach [21]. Restriction enzymes PstI-HF
and MspI (New England Biolabs, USA) were selected for li-
brary construction. 200 ng genomic DNA was fully digested
with the two enzymes. Digested fragments were ligated
with barcoded adaptors using T4-ligase (New England Bio-
labs, USA). Twenty four individuals were pooled for each
library and the libraries were cleaned up with QIAquick
PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Germany). The cleaned prod-
ucts were size selected and purified (300–500 bp) by run-
ning gels and using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen,
Germany), respectively. The recovered libraries were then
amplified using Phusion® High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase
(New England Biolabs, USA). After a final cleanup using
QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Germany), the
libraries were sent to a NextSeq 500 platform (Illumina,
USA) for 2 × 150 bp paired-end sequencing.
The program process_radtags [22] was employed to filter
the raw sequencing reads with default parameters and reads
with any uncalled base were removed. Clean reads were
then demultiplexed and trimmed to 100 bp for in silico
mapping. First, reads were mapped to the reference gen-
ome of grass carp v1.0 [23] using the program BWA-MEM
with default parameters [24]. Reads with multiple targets in
the reference were excluded from further analysis.
Reference-aligned reads were then assembled into
stacks for each individual using pstacks, implemented in
the package Stacks v1.34 [22]. Six individuals randomly
selected from each location were used to construct a cata-
logue of stacks using cstacks. Stacks from each individual
were then matched against the catalogue for SNP discovery
using sstacks. Finally, genotyping was conducted across all
locations using the program populations implemented in
Stacks with a minimum of 10× sequence depth and a suc-
cess of > 70% of the individuals in each location. RAD tags
were further removed if any SNP in the tag had more than
two alleles and showed an observed heterozygosity of > 0.5,
in order to remove paralogues [25]. As we observed that
linkage disequilibrium decayed rapidly within a region of
500 bp and the linkage between SNPs from each paired-
end RADtag was not significant, only the first SNP for each
single-end RAD tag was retained for further analysis by
populations. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) for each
locus was examined using Genepop v4.2 [26]. Loci that
deviated from HWE in a single location at the significance
level of 0.01 were excluded from further analysis to filter
out RAD tags, which are from polymorphic restriction sites
and thus suffer from null allele.
Analyzing population structure and phylogenetic
relationship
Genetic diversity measures for each location, including
observed heterozygosity (HO), expected heterozygosity
(HE) and nucleotide diversity (Π), as well as FST value for
each locus, were estimated using the program popula-
tions [22]. Population genetic divergence was estimated
in the form of pairwise FST using the program Arlequin
3.5 [27]. Statistical significance was examined using an
exact test with 10,000 permutations. Population struc-
ture at both the population and individual levels was in-
vestigated by principal component analysis using the
program Eigenstrat v5.1 [28]. The pattern of population
differentiation was examined in the form of isolation-by-
distance (IBD) using Mantel tests with the program IBD
v1.52 [29]. The genetic distance was measured as FST/(1-
FST). For geographical distance, however, the sampling
locations among different river systems are not directly
connected by river courses. Considering the long dis-
tance among locations and also the complicated pattern
of hydrographical connections among river systems, the
pairwise geographical distance was simply modelled as
linear distance between sampling localities. Population
structure and admixture was investigated using a max-
imum likelihood method implemented in the program
Admixture [30]. We carried out analysis with K (number
of population units) ranging from 1 to 12 with default
parameters. The K value which shows the lowest cross-
validation error is suggested to be the most likely num-
ber of genetic clusters [30]. Besides using whole data set
for Admixture analysis, we also used only one SNP from
each paired-end RADtag in case the results were biased
due to linkage between SNPs from the same paired-end
RADtag. However, no difference was observed in the
results between the two data sets. The phylogenetic re-
lationship among locations was constructed using a
Neighbor-Joining tree based on Nei’s standard genetic
distance with the program Poptree2 [31] by bootstrap-
ping over loci for 1000 times.
Inferring population origins of introduced grass carp
The population origins of the introduced grass carp were
inferred using an approximate Bayesian computation
method [32] implemented in the program Diyabc 2.1.0
[33]. Three simple competing scenarios were designed
and
tested
with
historical
demographic
parameters
drawn from the distribution of priors, based on the re-
sults of population structure. A total of 52 summary sta-
tistics including genic diversities, FST distances and Nei’s
distances were estimated and used for comparing among
scenarios. For the introduced location in Malaysia, two
structured native locations as shown in the admixture
analysis and an admixture population between the two
locations were used as potential source populations to
infer the ancestral population. In modeling the population
origins, three competing scenarios were designed: Sce-
nario 1, the introduced population originated from an
admixture population of both river systems; Scenario 2,

Page 3 of 16
the introduced population originated directly from the
Yangtze River System; and Scenario 3, the introduced
population originated directly from the Pearl River Sys-
tem. These scenarios assumed no migration among popu-
lations. Two ancestral populations from the Yangtze River
System and the Pearl River System, respectively, showing
the closest genetic relationship with the introduced
populations, were used for examination of the different
scenarios. An equal number of diploid individuals were
randomly selected from each of the introduced and an-
cestral populations. The number of individuals was de-
termined according to the smallest population. We also
tested the possibilities of applying the other native loca-
tions from each river system and found little difference
between the results. The origin of the South Asian loca-
tions (India and Nepal) was inferred in a similar man-
ner, by assuming the population in India to be the
ancestral population of that in Nepal. We also tested
the possibility that the population in India was founded
by migrants from the population in Nepal. However,
such scenarios were subsequently revealed to be less
competitive.
Historical demographic parameters, including diver-
gence time and historical population size changes that
might correlate to bottleneck events for introduced
populations, were considered for discrimination of the
competing scenarios. We applied uniform priors and
also the following parameter settings: t(n + 1) > tn > db
and N > Nm; N and Nm = [10–10,000]; t1, t2 and db =
[1–150]; t3 = [10–10,000]. All the other parameters
were using the default settings. A total of 106 simu-
lated datasets were generated for the three competing
scenarios to produce reference tables. The scenarios
and priors were pre-evaluated and at least one prior–
scenario combination was designed to produce simu-
lated datasets that are close to the observed datasets
[33]. The competing scenarios were examined by pos-
terior
probabilities
using
a
logistic
regression
ap-
proach with 1% of the simulated datasets. Type I and
II errors were further estimated to compare the com-
peting
scenarios.
The
parameters
were
computed
using the top 1% of simulated datasets which were
closest to the observed datasets. The competing sce-
narios were examined for goodness-of-fit by conduct-
ing model checking using all calculated summary
statistics with the PCA approach. Before these ana-
lyses, we filtered the SNPs by applying a missing data
cut-off of 0.05 and minor allele frequency threshold
of 0.05. Linkage disequilibrium between each pair of
SNPs was examined as R2 with the program VCFtools
[34] and SNPs with R2 < 0.05 were removed. Approxi-
mately 3000 markers were retained for estimation of
each set of competing scenarios in three runs to ob-
tain statistical robustness.
Identifying footprints of selection
Evidence of local adaptation was detected for individual
loci, using a Bayesian generalized linear mixed model
involving covariance of allele frequencies and environ-
mental variables and taking demography into account,
with the program Bayenv [35]. A Bayes factor (BF) was
calculated for each SNP to measure the strength of the
correlation between SNP variation and environmental
variables. According to the method by [35], a BF > 3 was
considered as a substantial evidence for selection. The
program was run for five times with an independent
variance-covariance matrix of population genetic vari-
ation to achieve consistency among the runs. The
genome-wide (neutral) variance-covariance matrix was
estimated using the whole data set, and the mean covari-
ance matrix over 100,000 iterations was considered. We
observed that the annual average temperature was highly
correlated to latitude (R2 = 0.992, P < 0.001). Only the
loci consistently identified to be significantly associated
with both temperature and latitude were retained to
study latitudinal gradients.
FST-based outlier tests were also performed to identify
signatures of local selection. Firstly, a Bayesian simulation-
based test implemented in BayeScan 2.1 [36] was used to
identify outlier SNPs. Outliers were determined using a
q-value threshold of 5%. Considering that grass carps
are distributed in different river systems and that there
is among-group genetic structure, a hierarchical island
model [37] for identifying outlier loci was also employed
using the program Arlequin 3.5 [27] with the following
parameters: 50,000 simulations, 10 simulated groups, and
100 demes per group. Only outliers, with a threshold of
0.995 and a false discovery rate of 0.01, were considered as
candidates under putative selection. In comparison to
Bayenv, the two FST-based outlier tests do not take demo-
graphic history into consideration. Because the null distri-
bution of these outlier tests still does not account for the
bottlenecks that have likely occurred in the introduced
populations, FST-based outlier tests were separately carried
out for native locations and for all locations.
Identifying loci and genes under putative selection
Loci under putative selection were mapped against the
raw annotation of the grass carp genome. SNPs within
both exons and introns were considered to have a gene
feature. Coding sequences of the genes were extracted
and then functionally annotated by Blast2Go [38] against
the nr database with an E-value cut-off of 10–6, annotation
cut-off of > 55 and a GO Weight of > 5. Enrichment of
Gene Ontology (GO) terms was conducted using the pro-
gram WEGO [39] with the whole gene set as background.
Candidate genes were also mapped to the reference gen-
ome of zebrafish (GRCz10) using Blastn to retrieve the cor-
responding Ensembl gene IDs. A more detailed functional

annotation of these genes was then performed by mapping
to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
pathway database [40] using the program David with de-
fault parameters of gene count > 2 and ease = 0.1 and using
all genes of zebrafish as the background [41].
Analyzing genomic patterns of differentiation
The patterns of differentiation across the genome were
examined to verify if there were genomic regions where
genomic loci under putative selection formed into clus-
ters and showed elevated divergence in comparison to
the background. Estimates of genetic differentiation be-
tween the locations distributed in the Yangtze and Pearl
River Systems were calculated. Fifty, 100, 150 and 200
Kb window-sized FST values were separately calculated
based on the 24 longest scaffolds, ranging from 9.6 to
19.1 Mb, of grass carp reference genome using the pro-
gram populations in stacks. Corresponding window-
sized SNP densities were also calculated to assess if the
genome-wide patterns of differentiation were independ-
ent of the patterns of SNP density.
Results
SNP discovery and genotyping
Genotyping by sequencing (GBS) produced an average
of 10.17 million raw reads per individual. After quality
control, 9.21 million reads per individual were obtained
for sequence mapping and SNP discovery. A total of
458,544 RADtags were detected and 280,544 SNPs were
discovered across all nine locations, with an average of
0.61 SNPs per RADtag. After removing the loci that
failed to meet the filtering criteria, 43,310 SNPs were ge-
notyped
across
all
locations,
among
which
28,412
(65.6%) showed minor allele frequency (MAF) of > 0.05
across the entire data set.
Genetic diversity and population structure
The measures of genetic diversity, including HO, HE and
Π, estimated based on all variant SNPs, are shown in
Additional file 8: Table S1. For the six native locations,
Vietnam showed slightly lower genetic diversity than the
others. The genetic diversity of the introduced popula-
tions was significantly lower than that of the native loca-
tions (Mann-Whitney U test, P < 0.01).
Pairwise FST analysis revealed significant genetic differ-
entiation between the native and the introduced popula-
tions with FST ranging from 0.1126 between Zhaoqing
and Indian populations to 0.2399 between Vietnam and
Malaysia (Additional file 9: Table S2). However, genetic
differentiation between each pair of native populations
was lower, with FST ranging from 0.007 between Jiujiang
and Shishou to 0.052 between Hanjiang and Vietnam,
but significantly different from 0 after Bonferroni correc-
tions for multiple comparisons. Compared to the other
native populations, Zhaoqing from the Pearl River Sys-
tem showed slightly lower genetic differentiation from
the three introduced populations. The effective gene
flow (Nm) estimated using FST ≈1/(4 Nm + 1) ranged
from 4.604 to 12.505 among the three river systems. For
native locations, genetic divergence at each individual
locus was estimated between the most divergent loca-
tions (Hanjiang vs Vietnam) and also between the most
distant locations (Nenjiang vs Vietnam). We observed
that no loci showed FST > 0.5 and only < 15% of loci had
FST > 0.1 between these sampling sites.
Principal component analysis revealed that the native
locations were strikingly differentiated from the intro-
duced locations (Fig. 1a). For the native locations,
Zhaoqing and Vietnam from the Pearl River System
were clearly differentiated from the locations from both
the Yangtze
River
System
(Hanjiang,
Jiujiang
and
Shishou) and the Heilongjiang River System (Nenjiang)
(Fig. 1b). Some individuals from both the Yangtze and
Heilongjiang River Systems showed a very close rela-
tionship, suggesting population admixture between the
two river systems (Fig. 1b). The pattern of genetic dif-
ferentiation across all native locations did not show a
significant signal of isolation-by-distance (R2 = 0.187,
P = 0.16; Additional file 2: Figure S2a). Some individuals
of the Heilongjiang River System are suggested to have
an origin from the Yangtze River System (Fig. 1b).
After excluding the Nenjiang location, we identified a
strong correlation between population differentiation
and geographical distance (R2 = 0.876, P < 0.001; Add-
itional file 2: Figure S2b). Consistent with the above re-
sults, the neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree revealed
that the native locations from the Yangtze, Heilongjiang
and Pearl River Systems formed three independent clus-
ters, respectively. The genetic distance between the intro-
duced and the native locations was significantly longer
than that among the native locations of each river system
(Additional file 3: Figure S3).
In Admixture analysis, the lowest cross-validation error
was identified at K = 6 (CV, 0.359) followed by at K = 4
(CV, 0.360) (Additional file 4: Figure S4). For K = 4, all the
native locations were grouped into one cluster, while the
three introduced locations were classified into three
independent clusters, respectively (Fig. 2). For K = 6, all
the native locations formed into three genetic clusters cor-
responding to the three river systems. We also found that
both Nenjiang and Zhaoqing of the Heilongjiang and the
Pearl River Systems, respectively, were mixed with genetic
cluster from the Yangtze River System (Fig. 2). The results
for K = 5 were similar with that for K = 6, except that
location India and Nepal formed into one cluster (Add-
itional file 5: Figure S5). Consistent with the PCA results,
location Nenjiang showed significant genetic composition
from both the Yangtze and the Pearl River Systems. To

make clear the genetic status of Nenjiang, we estimated
the proportion of each genetic composition within Nen-
jiang at K = 6 using the program Admixture [30]. Approxi-
mately 48.8, 43.6 and 7.5% of genetic composition of
Nenjiang were from the Heilongjiang, Yangtze and Pearl
River Systems, respectively. Interestingly, approximately
half of the individuals of Nenjiang still showed completely
native genetic composition of the putative Heilongjiang
River System (Additional file 5: Figure S5). To understand
the effects of such admixture on the native location, we
studied the pattern of population differentiation by re-
moving the individuals (10) of Nenjiang that showed sig-
nificant proportion (> 50%) of genetic composition from
the other two river systems. Removal of these individuals
led to Nenjiang location showing > 86.0% putative original
genetic composition of Heilongjiang River System. We ob-
served a strong signal of isolation-by-distance (R2 = 0.795,
P < 0.001; Additional file 2: Figure S2c), consistent with
the pattern of population differentiation of native loca-
tions excluding Nenjiang (Additional file 2: Figure S2b).
Origins of the introduced grass carps
Among the three competing scenarios, our analysis results
rejected the scenarios where grass carps in Malaysia were
derived from only one of the native populations. The sce-
nario considering an admixture population, contributed
by the populations of both the Yangtze and Pearl River
Systems, as the most likely population source of the

and PC2 contain all the meaningful signals. The native locations are annotated with the river systems where they were collected (Y, H and P
corresponding to the Yangtze, Heilongjiang and Pearl River Systems, respectively), while the introduced locations are indicated with I

introduced location in Malaysia was preferred over the
others (Scenario 1 in Fig. 3a and Table 1). The posterior
probability of this scenario was 0.806 (95% CI: 0.782–
0.829) and was much higher than the other assumed com-
peting scenarios. Both type I and II errors were estimated
to be low for this best scenario (0.021 and 0.009, respect-
ively). With regard to the source population of India and
Nepal, the scenario considering an admixture population
between the populations of the Yangtze and Pearl River
Systems (Scenario 1 in Fig. 3b and Table 1) was also
inferred to be the most probable scenario, with the highest
posterior probability of 0.927 (95% CI: 0.913–0.941). Type
I and II errors for this scenario were calculated as 0.018
and 0.012, respectively. We also tested alternatives to the
three competing scenarios by assuming that the intro-
duced grass carps were derived from a ghost or an
unsampled population, from each of the two river systems
or an admixture population of the two river systems, but
differentiated from the current populations. However,
these scenarios did not change the results and showed no
improvement to the current scenarios. Under the most
competitive scenario, estimation of the demographic
parameters revealed that both the introduced and native
locations had relatively large contemporary effective popu-
lation sizes (Additional file 10: Table S3). Nevertheless, all
the introduced locations experienced historically signifi-
cant population decline during the introduction processes
(Additional file 10: Table S3).
Identifying loci under putative selection
Only SNPs with MAF > 0.05 were used to identify signals
of selection using different approaches. Firstly, the native
locations were used to infer footprints of local selection
and latitudinal gradients. Using the whole data set, Bayenv
identified 71 loci showing significant associations between
genetic variations and latitudinal gradients (Table 2).
Arlequin and BayeScan detected, in total, 276 and 183
outliers, respectively, with 128 common outliers. As re-
vealed above, location Nenjiang was mixed with genetic
composition from the other two river systems. Such ad-
mixture is likely to disturb the patterns of local selection
and latitudinal gradients. Therefore, we performed an-
other round of both correlation and outlier tests after ex-
cluding the individuals (10) in Nenjiang that showed
significant genetic composition from the other river sys-
tems as stated above. Using such reduced data set, 70 loci
were found to be significantly associated with latitudinal
environmental variables, while 285 and 185 loci were
revealed to be outliers by Arlequin and BayeScan, re-
spectively, with 127 common outliers (Table 2). Be-
tween the two data sets, Arlequin and BayeScan
detected 175 (~ 62%) and 142 (~ 77%) common loci,
respectively, while no common loci with FST-based
outlier tests were identified using Bayenv.
To infer signatures of balancing selection that may be
involved in the introduction process, all nine locations
were included for FST-based outlier tests. We also ob-
served the same pattern as the above: that inclusion of
the individuals in Nenjiang with significant genetic com-
position from the other two river systems produced a set
of outliers slightly different to that generated after ex-
cluding these samples, both in terms of positive selection
and balancing selection (Table 3). To examine if this was
caused by the admixed composition of Nenjiang location
or just the variations resulting from alteration of sample
sets, we performed ‘leave-one-out’ tests by leaving Nen-
jiang in and removing any one of the other locations.
We found the overall proportions of common loci in
‘leave-one-out’ tests were ~ 5% and ~ 15% higher than
that of the above results generated using the data sets

ition of Nenjiang location might have slightly influenced
the signature of local selection. Further considering the
results of both Admixture and isolation-by-distances, the

System was still relatively independent (see discussion).
The selective regimes were likely still somewhat different
between migrants and natives in Nenjiang location. There-
fore, only results from the reduced data set were used to
study local selection for localized populations. In total,
Arlequin and BayeScan identified, respectively, 335 and
191 outliers under putative positive selection, with 11 com-
mon loci, as well as 206 and 77 loci under putative balan-
cing selection, with 74 common loci (Table 3). Considering
that FST-based outlier tests are vulnerable to false positives
in identifying positive selection when using populations
showing significant population structure and complicated
demographic history, and also the significant inconsistency
between the results of outlier tests in terms of positive se-
lection (Table 3), we only took the outliers under putative
balancing selection across all locations into consideration.
In total, 343 and 209 loci under putative positive and bal-
ancing selection, respectively, and 70 loci associated with
latitudinal gradients, were retained for further analysis. Out
of these loci, four showing latitudinal variations were also
detected as outliers under putative positive selection across
native locations.
Functional annotation of genes under putative selection
Mapping against the annotation of the reference genome
revealed that 227 out of 618 outliers (36.7%) were associ-
ated with 210 unique genes, showing no significant devi-
ation from the null hypothesis that 39.8% of all examined
loci could hit the genomic region of a gene in the genome.
A total of 154, 60 and 27 genes were revealed to be related
to putative positive selection, balancing selection and latitu-
dinal gradients, respectively (Additional file 11: Table S4).
Fifty-one and 17 genes were consistently suggested to be
candidates under putative positive and balancing selection,
respectively, by two different FST-based outlier tests. Out of
the 618 outliers, 35 (5.7%) were detected in the coding
sequences, also showing no deviation from the null hypoth-
esis that 5.6% of all examined loci could hit the coding
sequences of a gene in the genome. Fifteen (42.9%) were re-
vealed to cause amino-acid substitutions in known proteins,
within which 13 and 2 were associated with putative
positive and balancing selection, respectively (Add-
itional file 12: Table S5). This ratio was lower than
that of the null hypothesis of non-synonymous muta-
tions in coding sequences (47.4%).
GO enrichment revealed that the candidate genes were
related to local adaptations covered a wide range of func-
tions in biological processes: biological regulation, cellular
process, developmental process, metabolic process, pig-
mentation and response to stimulus (Additional file 6:
Figure S6). Genes involved in positive selection were
enriched into eight KEGG pathways. The most significant
pathways included ion transport (seven genes) and regula-
tion of transcription (seven genes) (Additional file 13:
Table S6). For genes under putative balancing selection,
the most significant enriched KEGG pathway was cal-
cium ion binding pathway (five genes) and hydrolase
activity (five genes) (Additional file 13: Table S6). Inter-
estingly, genes related to latitudinal gradients were
mainly enriched in the integral component of mem-
brane category, which includes 10 genes (Table 4 and
Additional file 13: Table S6).
Genome-wide patterns of differentiation
Different window-sized FST values were calculated along
the 24 longest scaffolds of the grass carp genome. Using a
sliding window of 150 kb, some specific genomic regions
were revealed to have higher than average differentiation
(Additional file 7: Figure S7). Examination using different
sizes of sliding window (50, 100, 200 and 250 kb) did not
change the results. In order to test if the FST elevated re-
gions are due to the non-random distribution of SNPs, the
genome-wide patterns of FST were compared with those
of SNP density for the same sliding window size. We
found that the distribution patterns of FST were independ-
ent of those of SNP density (Additional file 7: Figure S7a
and S7b). Interestingly, we observed that SNPs that were
identified to be under putative selection occurred much
more commonly within some specific genomic regions
showing elevated differentiation, in comparison to the
overall background (e.g., within the four long scaffolds,
CI01000000, CI01000004, CI01000005 and CI01000030
(Additional file 7: Figure S7c)). The size of the largest
‘genomic island’ was approximately 400 Kb in scaffold
CI01000005. Such specific genomic regions were also
observed to be independent of SNP density.

Discussion
In this study, we investigated range-wide population
structure of native locations and the origins of intro-
duced locations of grass carp in South and Southeast
Asia, as well as local selection and genome-wide patterns
of differentiation, using 43,310 SNPs covering the whole
genome. This study has important implications for un-
derstanding genetic differentiation under diverse envi-
ronments for freshwater fish species with a wide range
of geographical distribution.
Genetic diversity of native and introduced grass carps
In grass carp, we observed that genetic diversity in the
introduced locations was significantly reduced in com-
parison to that in the native locations. This result is con-
sistent with a previous study on assessment of genetic
diversity in introduced locations in the USA, Europe and
Japan and native locations in the Yangtze River System
using mitochondrial DNA [19]. As revealed by demo-
graphic analysis, such a decline of genetic diversity is
much likely caused by founder effects during population
introduction as well as sequential genetic drift and direc-
tional selection. At the first stage of colonization of new
habitats, populations having experienced founder events
are particularly sensitive to various evolutionary forces.
Genetic drift can work as the main evolutionary force,
randomly fixing alleles and rapidly driving differentiation
between the introduced and parental populations [8].
Meanwhile, multiple directional selections tend to fix
specific alleles and can also play important roles in the
process of colonization, resulting in continuous loss of
genetic diversity and increase of population differenti-
ation [42]. However, loss of genetic diversity does not
necessarily indicate loss of survival potential in new
habitats [43]. In our previous study, we observed that
Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer) in Australia, which sepa-
rated from the population in Southeast Asia 1.5 million
years ago, lost approximately 60% of genetic diversity,
but successfully adapted to and colonized the new con-
tinent [44]. Here, we observed that the contemporary
effective sizes of populations in the introduced locations
have recovered to a considerable level. In addition, the
grass carp has been introduced to over 80 counties for
aquaculture and controlling water weeds in water ways
[18]. All these data suggest that the grass carps have a
high capability to adapt to new habitats. Therefore, it is
an ideal species for controlling water weeds and aqua-
culture in many countries. Certainly, to avoid issues of
biological invasion, triploid grass carp should be used
for controlling water weeds.
High gene flow among native grass carp populations
Typically, freshwater fishes are more isolated by various
geographical factors than marine fishes, and thus have a
lower level of gene flow [45]. In this study, we observed
that pairwise population genetic differentiation was very
low, consistent with previous studies using microsatel-
lites [14, 16]. Considering the geographical isolation
among the three river systems, such results are rather
unexpected. Since the grass carp has been cultured for

food in China for more than 1300 years [12, 13], these
surprising results strongly suggest that high gene flow
among the three river systems is not only naturally oc-
curring but also by the aquaculture activities. Interest-
ingly, the observed pattern of population differentiation
did not conform to isolation-by-distance across the
whole data set. However, after excluding the individuals
in Nenjiang location that were suggested to have recent
origins from the Yangtze and Pearl River Systems, the
remaining samples showed a strong signal of isolation-
by-distance. This result indicates that although human-
induced gene flow might have played some role in shaping
the overall population structure of the grass carp, it only
showed a significant effect in the Heilongjiang River
System.
According to the historical records [12], grass carp
were abundant in both the Yangtze River System and the
Pearl River System, and were widely captured from the
wild as seeds for aquaculture locally. There was no prac-
tical need to introduce grass carp between the two river
systems. On the other hand, it is reasonable that gene
flow can be high between the two river systems because
they partially overlap in geography. For these reasons,
migration occurred much more naturally, and thus the
population differentiation showed a strong pattern of
isolation-by-distance. However, we cannot exclude the
possibility that human activities may have played an im-
portant role in the dispersal of grass carp. Such gene
flow might be merely induced so randomly that it can
also contribute to a pattern of isolation-by-distance. In
contrast to the Yangtze and the Pearl River systems, the
distribution and culture of grass carps in the Heilong-
jiang River System have never been abundant nor con-
sidered as a major aquaculture practice according to
both historical records and current official fishery statis-
tics [12, 13]. Geographically, the Heilongjiang River
System is completely isolated from the Yangtze and Pearl
River Systems. On the other hand, the Nenjiang location
showed a signature of admixture from the three studied
river systems. Hence, the low genetic differentiation
between this river system and the other river systems
indicates that human-induced dispersal played a more
important role than natural gene flow. In fact, grass
carps in the Heilongjiang River System grow slower than
in the other river systems due to low water temperature
[46]. Therefore, seeds from the other river systems, par-
ticularly from the Yangtze River System, were commonly
introduced for aquaculture purposes because of geo-
graphical adjacency [12]. This is the most likely explan-
ation for the low genetic differentiation of grass carp
between the Heilongjiang River System and the other
river systems. However, it is clear that the estimates of
gene flow based on genetic data should be cautious be-
cause assumptions underlying the methods might not be
consistent with the actual action in the nature, particu-
larly for the populations with large spatial distribution
and complicated demographic history. Future studies
should be based on approaches for direct estimation of
dispersal (e.g., small GPS tracker or radio transmitters
and marker-assisted migration estimates), which can
substantially improve the estimates of gene flow.
It also should be noted that the genetic status of
Nenjiang in the Heilongjiang River System much likely
has not been significantly influenced by the recent intro-
duction of grass carp from the other river systems.
Although ~ 50% of the overall genetic composition of
Nenjiang was observed from the Yangtze and Pearl River
Systems, some individuals still showed completely native
genetic composition of the Heilongjiang River System
while most of the others showed a large proportion of
genetic composition from the other two river systems.
Such results likely suggest that the introduced grass
carps have not randomly mated with the natives in
Nenjiang. Interestingly, a significant pattern of isolation-
by-distance across native locations can be observed
when excluding the grass carps in Nenjiang showing
significant genetic composition from the other river sys-
tems. This is also the differentiation pattern among the
locations within the Yangtze and Pearl River Systems.
Altogether, our results suggest that the native gene pool
of the Heilongjiang River System was still relatively inde-
pendent and has not been significantly influenced by the
immigrants from the other river systems. It may also sug-
gest that the reproduction and hybridization capacity for
the immigrants were limited in the extreme environment
and due to genomic divergence although this should be
experimentally examined in future studies. Above all, the
current population structure should be taken into consid-
eration when establishing conservation strategies and
utilizing the natural resources for aquaculture, particularly
the grass carps of Heilongjiang River System.
Origins of the introduced grass carps
As discussed above, we observed significant genetic hetero-
geneity both in terms of genetic diversity and differentiation
between the native and the introduced locations, as well as
historical population decline in demographic models,
suggesting significant founder effects in the introduced
locations. It is likely that the introduction of grass carps
was not initiated under planned programs or that not all
the introduced fish could adapt to the new habitats. As
expected, we identified significant population structure and
also a clear geographical pattern of differentiation among
the three river systems in a background of high gene flow,
which allows tracing back the origins of the introduced
locations [47]. Interestingly, the ancestral source popula-
tions of the introduced locations in Malaysia and South
Asia were inferred to be an admixture of populations from
Shen et al. BMC Genomics          (2019) 20:467 
Page 11 of 16
the Yangtze and Pearl River Systems. This was the most
well-supported among competing scenarios. It was re-
corded that grass carp was first introduced into Malaysia
from Southern China with the large-scale migration of
Chinese people in the 1800s [20]. As shown by a history
study, most of the Chinese people in Southeast Asia were
from Guangdong and Fujian provinces, which to some ex-
tent geographically overlap with the Pearl and Yangtze
River Systems, respectively. Thus, the Malaysian location
was likely founded by immigrants from both Guangdong
and Fujian provinces. As for the introduced locations in
India and Nepal, the source origin was also inferred as an
admixture population from both the Yangtze and Pearl
River Systems, although it was recorded to be from Hong
Kong, a city within the Pearl River System. Hong Kong
imported almost all its freshwater fish products from main-
land China [48] and it has been documented that Hong
Kong has a long history of importing grass carp from the
regions of both of the two river systems [48, 49]. Hence, it
is likely that grass carp in Hong Kong is also an admixture
of populations between the two river systems.
Taken together, our data suggest that the genetic dif-
ferentiation among native populations is high enough to
allow tracing the origins of the recently introduced grass
carp (e.g., the populations introduced to Europe and
North America [13]. These results are valuable for
studying the production and physiological adaptation, as
well as the living environments and habitat preferences,
of both native and introduced locations. Such informa-
tion can be referenced to construct comprehensive
introduction plans for aquaculture of the grass carp for
food or for controlling water weeds in water ways in the
future. It also should be noted that the source popula-
tions don’t cover the whole native distribution areas of
grass carp. Thus, we can not exclude the possibility that
there are some other source populations that need
further evaluation.
Local selection across native locations
It is a great challenge to discriminate local selection from
neutral processes for organisms that have experienced
complicated demographic history. Neutral processes can
generate the same marks on genomic architecture as local
adaptation does [50, 51]. In some cases, adaptive traits
show a specific distribution pattern along environmental
factor. If the neutral forces are coincidentally varying along
some specific environmental gradients, the difficulty of dis-
entangling the roles of adaptive driving forces of the same
environmental gradients would be greatly exacerbated [52].
Grass carp is a species with a significant signature of latitu-
dinal distribution and a differentiation pattern of isolation-
by-distance. Thus, the adaptive traits might vary in parallel
with the pattern of neutral processes along latitude. These
evolutionary processes limited the potential to identify the
signals of local adaptation [52]. Here, we used concep-
tually different approaches to differentiate the signa-
tures of local adaptation from the currents of neutral
evolutionary processes [51, 53].
Grass carp originated from the Yangtze River System
and expanded into the Pearl and Heilongjiang River Sys-
tems during the Pleistocene and Pliocene, respectively
[12]. As the Pearl and Heilongjiang River Systems cover
the southernmost and the northernmost distribution
ranges, respectively, such contrasting environments have
likely posed strong selective pressure on the distribution
of the grass carp. Such a process of natural selection
provides important clues to discriminate signals of local
adaptation from genome-wide patterns of isolation-by-
distance. As discussed above, we found that ~ 50% of
grass carps in Nenjiang likely originated from both the
Yangtze and Pearl River Systems, and the recently intro-
duced grass carps much likely have not mated randomly
with the natives. Although the native gene pool of
Heilongjiang River System was still relatively independ-
ent, the above-mentioned pattern of admixture is likely
to weaken or even disrupt the detection of signals of se-
lection in localized populations. Considering the poten-
tial adverse influence, only the results, after excluding
the individuals in Nenjiang carrying a large proportion
of genetic composition from the other river systems,
were taken into consideration for further discussion.
In a strong background of isolation-by-distance for the
overall population differentiation, only 409 SNPs were
detected as putative candidates for local adaptation, ac-
counting for 1.4% of the total analyzed loci. This ratio is
relatively low, compared to previous studies in fish
species (2.3–10%, including Atlantic salmon [54] and
Chinook salmon [55] that showed weak or non-significant
genome-wide patterns of isolation-by-distance. Such re-
sults likely suggest that the power to identify loci under
selection is low under any high background FST, even if it
does not correlate with distance. Bayenv revealed that 70
SNPs were associated with latitudinal gradients, indicating
clinally adaptive divergence at these loci [56]. Moreover,
343 SNPs were identified as putative FST outliers, which
likely suggest diversifying selection across distinct distri-
bution environments of grass carp. Interestingly, no over-
lapping loci were identified between these conceptually
different tests, suggesting a complicated demographic
history for the studied grass carp locations. Functional
annotation and enrichment analysis showed that most of
the enriched biological function categories were common
between FST outliers and Bayenv results under putative se-
lection, although there were only four shared loci between
the two types of data sets. Moreover, two pathways associ-
ated with transcription factors were also enriched, imply-
ing that transcription factors also likely play important
roles in driving local adaptation. One interesting finding
Shen et al. BMC Genomics          (2019) 20:467 
Page 12 of 16
of this study is that genes related to latitudinal gradi-
ents were mainly enriched in the integral component of
membrane category, including 10 genes. Previous stud-
ies on thermal adaption in arctic and hot-springs fish
species also suggested that components in membrane
played an important role in evolutionary adaptation to
temperature [57]. These data suggest that the 10 genes
in the integral component of membrane category are
important for thermal adaption. How these genes play
an important role in local adaptation remains to further
study by functional analysis of these genes in model
organism, including zebrafish.
Selective pressures during introduction and colonization
Identifying genetic variations during population intro-
duction and colonization is critical to understanding the
mechanism of this evolutionary process and developing
strategies for genetic control of biological invasions [10].
The grass carp has successfully been introduced to and
colonized new continents, including North America,
Australia and Europe, and are destroying the native
species in the new habitats [13]. Although phenotypic
plasticity can play important roles in rapid adaptation to
novel diverse environments, fluctuations in genetic vari-
ations are likely much more important for the invasive
species in response to rapid changes of selective pres-
sures [58]. For introduced populations, founder effects,
random genetic drift and directional positive selection
tend to reduce genetic diversity at the whole genome
level [8]. Nevertheless, many adaptation-related traits
are polygenic and thus the loss of variation at these loci
might not influence the fitness as quickly as loss of vari-
ation at individual loci does for qualitative traits [58].
Nevertheless, founder effects, random genetic drift and
directional positive selection are strong enough to drive
introduced populations of small population size towards
allopatric divergence [44, 59]. Such rapid population
differentiation and the underlying complicated demo-
graphic history can generate confusing signals and thus
generate great challenges to the present statistical ap-
proaches to identify the signatures of positive selection
[36]. In this study, we found that only 11 out of 28,412
loci (0.04%) were consistently detected by both Arlequin
(335) and BayeScan (191) to be under putative positive
selection for the introduced locations, much likely sug-
gesting a considerable proportion of false positives in
the detected loci. This result does not necessarily suggest
positive selection in the introduced grass carps due to
the low effectiveness of FST-based outlier tests in popula-
tions of complicated demographic history [36]. We also
cannot exclude the possibility that genetic changes fit-
ting the corresponding positive selections occurred prior
to introduction of the studied grass carp, so that the sig-
nal of positive selection in the form of FST was disturbed
[10]. In total, the pressure of positive selection in the in-
troduced grass carp is still unclear and likely has been
significantly underestimated.
In comparison to directionally positive selection, many
more loci (74, 0.26%) were consistently identified to be
under putative balancing selection by Arlequin (206)
and BayeScan (77). In particular, BayeScan showed a
more conservative result than Arlequin did, which is
likely because the scenarios underlying BayeScan are less
sensitive to the changes of effective population size and
immigration rates among studied locations [36]. In pop-
ulations having experienced significant founder events,
genetic drift and directional selection, higher genetic di-
versity at specific loci is typically maintained by putative
balancing selection. Genes associated with these loci are
critically important for the introduced species to survive
in novel environments [9]. We observed that genes
under putative balancing selection were associated with
many functions in grass carp as revealed by GO enrich-
ment analysis. However, loci under putative balancing
selection have not attracted sufficient attention as much
as the loci under putative positive selection, because
positive selection seems to be more evidently related to
spatial geographic factors and quantized environmental
variables [60]. Here, we found that one non-synonymous
mutation in a hot shock protein family gene, DnaJ
(Hsp40) homolog, subfamily B, member 9a (DNAJB9a),
was under putative balancing selection within the intro-
duced locations of grass carp. This gene plays an import-
ant
role
in
disease
and
stress
responses
[61].
Maintaining a high level of genetic variation at this locus
is likely critical to the survival of the species in different
environments. Thus, involving a variety of selective
sweeps to maintain beneficial genetic diversity, balancing
selection could be just as critical as directional positive
selection to the survival of isolated populations. How-
ever, these results should be taken with caution, as loci
under putative selection still suffered from false positives
due to low effectiveness of outlier tests. Nevertheless, we
identified evidence of both positive and balancing selec-
tion on grass carp distributed in diverse environmental
conditions. These evolutionary forces in combination
with the environment variables should be taken into
account when designing introduction strategies for both
biological control and selective breeding purposes.
Genome-wide patterns of differentiation
The ‘divergence hitchhiking’ scenario of divergence-
with-gene-flow, in which specific genomic regions show
elevated differentiation than average, has been testified
in some fish species (e.g., stickleback, Gasterosteus acu-
leatus [62], Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua [63] and cichlid
species [64]. Here, we observed evidence of such a ‘gen-
omic islands’ model of divergence-with-gene-flow in the
Shen et al. BMC Genomics          (2019) 20:467

grass carp, a freshwater fish species isolated by long
geographic distance but with considerable gene flow. In-
dependent of SNP density, the clustering of outlier SNPs
within the specific genomic regions with elevated FST is
not likely to be artifacts resulting from the relatively
small number and the uneven distribution of markers.
Consistent with conclusions in cichlid, stickleback and
some other fish species, the ‘genomic islands’ model
might be a common pattern of divergence with frequent
gene flow [3]. Different from species with high gene
flow, grass carps are geographically isolated by long dis-
tance with a strong background of isolation-by-distance,
and the gene flow among populations is also low. The
presence of ‘genomic islands’ or divergence hitchhiking
of loci under selection is likely to suggest that the pres-
sure of natural selection can overwhelm the effects of
random genetic drift, mutation, gene flow and popula-
tion subdivision [4], and selection sweeps do not work
on random, isolated and physically unlinked genes [44].
Conclusions
Using population genomic approaches, we detected low
but significant genetic differentiation in native locations of
grass carp and disentangled the effects of environmental
factors, demographic history and human activities on con-
temporary genetic differentiation. The level of differenti-
ation allows tracing the global introduction history of grass
carp. The applications of different approaches identified a
set of loci under putative positive and balancing selection
for the native and introduced locations, respectively. The
latitudinal distribution of native grass carp likely has an
adaptive genetic basis, although the underlying causes re-
main to be elucidated. Nevertheless, local adaptation has
likely played important roles in shaping the contemporary
population structure of grass carp. Balancing selection is
also likely indispensable to the survival of grass carp during
introduction so as to adapt to new habitats. Our data
shed new lights on population structure, genetic di-
versity, sources of introduction and the strong ability
of the grass carp in adapting to diverse environments,
which could, in turn, facilitate its aquaculture.
