Abstract
Background: Transcriptional responses required to maintain cellular homeostasis or to adapt to environmental
stress, is in part mediated by several nucleic-acid associated proteins. In this study, we sought to establish an affinity
purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) approach that would enable the collective identification of nucleic acid-
associated proteins in mycobacteria. We hypothesized that targeting the RNA polymerase complex through affinity
purification would allow for the identification of RNA- and DNA-associated proteins that not only maintain the
bacterial chromosome but also enable transcription and translation.
Results: AP-MS analysis of the RNA polymerase β-subunit cross-linked to nucleic acids identified 275 putative
nucleic acid-associated proteins in the model organism Mycobacterium smegmatis under standard culturing
conditions. The AP-MS approach successfully identified proteins that are known to make up the RNA polymerase
complex, as well as several other known RNA polymerase complex-associated proteins such as a DNA polymerase,
sigma factors, transcriptional regulators, and helicases. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of the identified proteins
revealed that this approach selected for proteins with GO terms associated with nucleic acids and cellular
metabolism. Importantly, we identified several proteins of unknown function not previously known to be associated
with nucleic acids. Validation of several candidate nucleic acid-associated proteins demonstrated for the first time DNA
association of ectopically expressed MSMEG_1060, MSMEG_2695 and MSMEG_4306 through affinity purification.
Conclusions: Effective identification of nucleic acid-associated proteins, which make up the RNA polymerase complex
as well as other DNA- and RNA-associated proteins, was facilitated by affinity purification of the RNA polymerase β-
subunit in M. smegmatis. The successful identification of several transcriptional regulators suggest that our approach
could be sensitive enough to investigate the nucleic acid-associated proteins that maintain cellular functions and
mediate transcriptional and translational change in response to environmental stress.

Background
Nucleic acid-associated proteins are required to regulate
and execute the transcriptional responses required to
sustain cellular homeostasis or to adapt to environmental
stresses experienced. DNA-associated proteins are known
to include DNA polymerases, transcription factors, nucle-
ases and nucleoid-associated proteins (bacteria) which aid
in transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, recombination
and stabilization of the bacterial nucleoid [1–3]. Likewise,
RNA-associated proteins which include the RNA poly-
merase complex, ribosomal proteins, ligases and helicases
have been shown to influence RNA stability, transport,
localisation and translation [4, 5]. The identification and
investigation of DNA- and RNA-associated proteins are
known to be problematic as some protein populations,
such as transcriptional regulators, are often low in abun-
dance or exhibit weak DNA binding abilities [6, 7]. High-
throughput methodologies used in the past to identify
these proteins included sucrose density centrifugation
followed by mass spectrometry, which was effective in the
identification of nucleic acid-associated proteins, but these
workflows are prone to protein contaminants from other
cellular fractions [8]. Other approaches have made use of
nonspecific, specific, single- or double-stranded DNA
columns to affinity purify DNA-binding proteins for
identification [9]. More recently, an improved affinity
purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) approach was
developed to aid in the identification of unknown
DNA-binding proteins to known DNA sequences and
another approach, Epi-Decoder, made use of Tag-
chromatin
immunoprecipitation-Barcode-Sequencing
to
identify
DNA-binding
proteins
associated
with
known DNA loci through DNA sequencing [10, 11].
Advances in RNA proteomics has seen methodologies
such as enhanced RNA interactome capture (eRIC) and
orthogonal organic phase separation (OOPS) efficiently
identify RNA-binding proteins [12, 13].
The identification of these nucleic-acid associated pro-
teins has aided in our understanding of the proteins
which are required to sustain cellular homeostasis or
adapt to environmental stress. In mycobacteria, high-
throughput technologies such as microarrays, ChIP-seq
and RNA-seq have been instrumental in understanding
the transcriptional responses necessary for bacterial sur-
vival and cell homeostasis [1, 14–18]. One limitation of
ChIP-seq and microarrays are that these methodologies
investigate transcriptional regulators individually, which
can be problematic when adaptation to adverse envir-
onmental conditions involves multiple transcriptional
regulators and regulatory elements acting in concert.
Understanding adaptation to environmental stress is
further complicated by the concurrent regulation of
genes through transcriptional regulators, as seen in M.
tuberculosis with
DevR
and Lsr2 which
are both
induced by hypoxia and redox stress [19–23]. The over-
lap in gene regulation by some transcriptional regula-
tors may suggest that several regulatory elements
known to be associated with specific environmental
cues may have unknown functions. A new approach
that would aid in the identification of regulatory pro-
teins required by bacteria for cellular homeostasis or to
adapt to environmental stress conditions is therefore
needed. The development of a global, high-throughput
approach, which can be used to identify and character-
ise these regulatory proteins, will allow us to better
understand complex transcriptional cascades.
In this study, we aimed to identify mycobacterial
nucleic acid-associated proteins required for maintaining
cell homeostasis under standard laboratory conditions
by targeting the RNA polymerase (RNAP) complex as a
“tag” for nucleic acids in the non-pathogenic model
organism Mycobacterium smegmatis. We successfully
applied an affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-
MS) approach, to identify not only proteins that make
up the RNAP complex but also other proteins that are
known to be associated with nucleic acids and the RNAP
complex. These include 12 uncharacterised proteins with
no known predicted cellular functions or known associ-
ation with nucleic acids. To validate the ability of our AP-
MS approach to identify nucleic acid-associated proteins,
we sought to demonstrate DNA association for several
identified proteins. We propose that our approach can be
used to investigate protein populations required by myco-
bacterial species to sustain cellular stability during normal
growth or under stress, and that this approach may have
utility in other bacterial species.
Results
Identifying nucleic acid-associated proteins in M.
smegmatis
To identify possible RNAP and nucleic acid-associated
proteins, we affinity purified the RNAP complex from
formaldehyde treated M. smegmatis cell lysates using an
anti-RNAP β-subunit antibody immobilized on protein
G magnetic beads (Fig. 1). Formaldehyde is a four-atom
molecule that chemically crosslinks protein-nucleic acid
or protein-protein complexes that are ~ 2 Å apart, allow-
ing for the successful isolation of interacting proteins
but also enabling the isolation of any closely associated
proteins [24, 25]. We predicted that formaldehyde treat-
ment of M. smegmatis cultures would not only result in
the stable isolation of the RNAP complex and its associ-
ated proteins, but also enrich for proteins associated
with DNA and RNA molecules. To control for non-
specific interactions during immunoprecipitations we
included a protein G Dynabead control as well as a non-
specific antibody control, protein G Dynabeads coated
with anti-human heavy chain seven myosin antibody.

Using this approach, we identified 6678 unique pep-
tides that mapped to 503 protein groups with a least two
unique peptides (Fig. 2a). Principal component analysis
revealed separate clustering of replicate anti-RNAP and
control immunoprecipitations before filtering for protein
detection in at least two of three anti-RNAP immuno-
precipitations (Fig. 2b). These plots demonstrate that
clustering of anti-RNAP immunoprecipitations was not
a result of filtering for proteins detected in at least two
of the three anti-RNAP immunoprecipitations. Hierarch-
ical clustering using a heatmap demonstrated separate
clustering of anti-RNAP and control immunoprecipita-
tions for the 325 proteins that were identified in least
two of the three anti-RNAP immunoprecipitations and
demonstrated the ability of our AP-MS approach to limit
contaminant protein identifications within control immu-
noprecipitations (Fig. 2c). We identified 214 high confi-
dence proteins, which were identified within at least two of
the three anti-RNAP immunoprecipitations, but not in any
of the control immunoprecipitations (Additional file 2:
Table S2-S4). We further applied a set of less stringent
criteria to identify a set of lower confidence proteins
(Additional file 2: Table S5). These were defined as pro-
teins also identified in the negative control immunopre-
cipitations, but detected in higher abundance in the
anti-RNAP β-subunit immunoprecipitations than in the
control immunoprecipitations. Label-free quantification
(LFQ) data was used to identify the low confidence nu-
cleic acid-associated proteins by performing a multiple
sample test ANOVA with an FDR of 0.05 using the
Benjamini-Hochberg correction. This identified 61 low
confidence proteins (Fig. 2a, Additional file 2: Table S2-
S5). Of the 275 proteins identified (214 high confidence
and 61 low confidence proteins), we identified the core
proteins which are known to make up the RNAP com-
plex in bacterial organisms (Fig. 3a). Specific M. smeg-
matis

included
RpoA, −B, −C, −D (Sig A)*, −Z* as well as two other
sigma factors, SigH* and MysB* (Additional file 2:
Table S2) (* denotes high confidence proteins). Our ap-
proach also successfully identified proteins that are
known to make up the DNA replication complex in
bacteria (Fig. 3b). These protein identifications con-
firmed the validity of our approach to identify nucleic
acid-associated proteins.
We next sought to determine which functional attri-
butes were enriched within our list of protein identifica-
tions, to do this we performed a GO enrichment analysis
using the Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis Software
Toolkit (GOEAST) [26]. Classification of enriched GO
terms using Reduce Visualize Gene Ontology (REVIGO)
revealed that 104 non-redundant enriched GO terms
were associated with the functional category biological
processes (Additional file 2: Table S6), 60 with molecular

RNA polymerase antibody immobilized on protein G coated magnetic beads. Immunoprecipitated proteins were digested of magnetic beads
using trypsin and mass spectrometry analysis was performed to identify nucleic acid-associated proteins

Fig. 2 Identification of nucleic acid-associated proteins from mass spectrometry data. a. Diagram demonstrating data analysis of mass
spectrometry data. Three hundred and twenty-five protein groups were identified in at least two of the three immunoprecipitations, 222 of these
were identified as high confidence protein groups and were not identified in any of the control immunoprecipitations. Multiple sample testing
with an FDR of 0.05 and a fold change of two was used to identify 63 low confidence proteins from 103 possible low confidence proteins.
Uniprot protein annotations were mapped to MSMEG database annotations, removing Uniport annotations that matched to MSMEI or LJ100
database annotations (assigned during automated database searching), resulting in the identification of 220 high confidence and 61 low
confidence proteins. Following the manual inspection of spectra for all proteins identified with a minimum of 2 unique peptides, a total of 275
proteins were identified, of which 214 were high confidence proteins and 61 were low confidence proteins. b. Principal component analysis
revealed separate clustering of replicate anti-RNAP immunoprecipitations and control immunoprecipitations for the 503 protein groups with two
unique peptides. Anti-RNAP immunoprecipitations are displayed in red blocks on the right with protein G Dynabead control
immunoprecipitations displayed in green and anti-MYH7 control immunoprecipitations displayed in blue on the left. c. The heatmap shows the
clustering of the anti-RNA polymerase immunoprecipitation on the left and control immunoprecipitations right and center. The red colour is
indicative of a higher abundance and the blue of a lower abundance of a protein within an immunoprecipitated sample. The grey colouring

function (Additional file 2: Table S7) and 23 with cellu-
lar processes (Additional file 2: Table S8) [27]. Hierarch-
ical clustering of the GO annotations in the functional
categories biological processes (Additional file 1: Figure
S1) and molecular function (Additional file 1: Figure S2)
revealed an enrichment for several GO terms associated
with nucleic acids. Enriched GO terms within these cat-
egories included “DNA replication”, “translation”, “DNA
metabolic process”, “nucleic acid binding” and “RNA
binding”. Unsurprisingly, the GO annotation “ribosome”
was the most enriched term in the functional category
cellular components (Additional file 1: Figure S3).
To
better
demonstrate
the
relationships
between
enriched GO terms in the functional categories bio-
logical processes and molecular functions, we made use
of functional annotation network graphs generated using
REVIGO and Cytoscape (Figs. 4a and 5a) [27, 28]. These
functional annotation networks displayed enriched GO
terms as nodes, of which the colour is indicative of –
log10 p-value of the GO term enrichment. Highly simi-
lar GO terms were connected by edges. Functional
annotation
network
graphs
for
biological
processes
(Fig. 4a) and molecular function (Fig. 5a) demonstrated
that several GO terms associated were enriched and
connected, suggesting that the proteins identified in this
study may have similar or related functional attributes.
As we expected, our approach also facilitated the enrich-
ment of proteins in close proximity or in direct contact
with the RNAP complex, as can be seen with the
enriched and connected GO terms related to nucleic
acids (Figs. 4b and 5b). Metabolic pathway mapping
using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes re-
vealed that proteins identified in this study are not only
predicted to be required for nucleic acid metabolism,
but also for energy, lipid, carbohydrate and amino acid
metabolism (Additional file 1: Figure S4) [29].
DNA association of identified proteins
Annotation of the M. smegmatis genome revealed that it
encodes for approximately 6938 proteins [30]. Gene ontol-
ogies have been used to suggest functional attributes for
all predicted proteins based on the homology of conserved
domains, however, very little of this has been corroborated
using functional studies. A subset of genes, 24.6% (1708
genes) are believed to encode for hypothetical proteins, of
which 1040 genes are thought to encode for conserved
hypothetical proteins [30]. Given the high proportion of
predicted hypothetical proteins that may be encoded by
M. smegmatis and the high number of proteins that still
remains to be functionally investigated, several DNA- and
RNA-associated proteins may still remain unidentified.
To validate the ability of our AP-MS approach to iden-
tify
nucleic
acid-associated
proteins,
we
determined
whether select proteins from our high confidence list are
DNA-associated. We expressed five M. smegmatis genes
from an episomal plasmid as N-terminal FLAG-tagged
proteins (Table 1, Additional file 1: Figure S5). MSMEG_
1060, MSMEG_2695, MSMEG_3754, MSMEG_4306 and
MSMEG_5512 are proteins of unknown function, which
were selected through the identification of conserved
protein domains that have been shown to be associ-
ated with nucleic acids (Table 1). Three of these

The
nucleoid-associated
protein HupB (MSMEG_2389) was selected as a posi-
tive control and the cytoplasmic component of the

selected as a negative control (Fig. 6). A protein G
Dynabead control, as well as a M. smegmatis strain
expressing the FLAG-tag alone were also included as
negative controls (Fig. 6). We successfully recovered
DNA from affinity purified FLAG-tagged MSMEG_
1060, MSMEG_2695 and MSMEG_4306 (Fig. 6). Al-
though this does not directly confirm DNA binding
by the episomally expressed proteins, formaldehyde
crosslinking does suggest that these proteins may at
least be in close proximity to DNA [34]. No DNA as-
sociation was found following affinity purification of
FLAG-tagged

identified 275 proteins, of which 214 were deemed high
confidence proteins (these proteins were not detected in
any control immunoprecipitations) and a further 61 as
low confidence proteins (proteins that were identified in
a greater abundance within anti-RNAP immunoprecipi-
tations (Fig. 2a, Additional file 2: Table S2).
Formaldehyde treatment of M. smegmatis cells created
stable cross-links between protein-nucleic acids and
protein-protein interaction complexes, thereby allowing
us to investigate these complexes under near-physiological
conditions [34]. Although chemical cross-linking with for-
maldehyde does limit our ability to distinguish between
protein-nucleic acid and protein-protein interactions, in
this study formaldehyde stabilization of protein-protein
complexes allowed the purification of the RNAP complex
through the targeting of the RNAP β-subunit. Furthermore,
the introduction of possible variable modifications though
formaldehyde cross-linking limits our ability to identify all
immunoprecipitated proteins as only the most frequently
occurring modifications were selected for automated data-
base searching (Additional file 2: Table S1, Table S3). New
methodologies such as eRIC and OOPS have made use of
UV cross-linking to stabilize protein-RNA and protein-
DNA interactions through the generation of “zero length”
protein-nucleic acid cross-links which has successfully been
used to improve ChIP-seq specificity and to investigate
RNA binding proteins [12, 13, 35, 36]. However, this ap-
proach is not exempt from to the generation of protein-
protein cross-links, as demonstrated by the generation of
covalent cross-links between aromatic amino acids, thereby
not ruling out the possibility of identifying associated pro-
teins [37]. Inspection of the proteins identified in our study

revealed that our approach successfully identified several
nucleic acid associated proteins including, DNA polymer-
ases, topoisomerases, helicases, transcription factors and
ribosomes (Additional file 2: Table S2). We identified 20
uncharacterized proteins (Additional file 2: Table S2), of
which 12 (MSMEG_0067, MSMEG_0243, MSMEG_0754,
MSMEG_0824, MSMEG_0948, MSMEG_1165, MSMEG_
1342,

terms and are not known to be associated with nucleic
acids or nucleic acid-associated proteins. Gene ontology
enrichment analysis demonstrated that several GO terms
associated with nucleic acids were enriched, suggesting an
enrichment for nucleic acid-associated proteins (Additional
file 2: Table S6-S7). Furthermore, our data indicates that
proteins identified in this study have similar or related func-
tions (Figs. 4 and 5). Notably, gene ontology enrichment for
the functional category cellular components demonstrated
an enrichment for the GO term “ribosome”, but no enrich-
ment for any cell wall or membrane components was
found. This was expected as our approach failed to identify
cell wall associated proteins, apart from the cell wall synthe-
sis proteins CwsA and Wag31. These proteins may be
involved in septal and polar peptidoglycan synthesis and in
the coordination of FtsZ-ring assembly in mycobacteria,
suggesting that these proteins were likely identified because
of their proximity to nucleic acids and nucleic acid-
associated proteins [38]. Metabolic pathway mapping of
identified proteins demonstrated that apart from identifying
proteins required for transcription and translation, that our
AP-MS approach identified proteins involved in energy,
amino acid and lipid metabolism (Additional file 1: Figure
S4). These “contaminant” proteins may have been cross-
linked to the RNAP complex or other nucleic acid interact-
ing proteins and included proteins known to be associated
with iron-sulphur cluster assembly, energy metabolism and
amino acid metabolism (Additional file 2: Table S2). The
identification of these “contaminant” proteins are not unex-
pected as they are likely involved in the maintenance and
function of the RNA and DNA polymerase complexes.
Iron-sulphur clusters are important elements of several
proteins, including DNA polymerases, nucleases and heli-
cases, which are crucial enzymes for DNA replication and
repair [39]. The identification of iron-sulphur cluster as-
sembly proteins together with nucleic acid-associated pro-
teins suggest a role for these proteins in transcriptional
maintenance and execution. Likewise, energy metabolism
proteins will be required for transcriptional and transla-
tional maintenance and execution.
Similar to ChIP-seq workflows, cross-linked protein-
nucleic acid complexes were purified using an antibody
immobilized on a solid matrix (Fig. 1). We considered
the RNAP complex as a suitable “tag” for nucleic acids
in the cell due to the dispersed presence of the RNAP
complex throughout the M. tuberculosis and M. smeg-
matis genomes [18, 40]. By targeting
the natively
expressed
RNAP
complex
and
not
an
ectopically
expressed tagged DNA or RNA interacting protein, we
limited altering the physiological state of the organism,
which could result in the identification of non-specific
proteins [41]. Furthermore, mouse IgG antibodies have
previously been shown to be resistant to proteolytic
cleavage by trypsin under native conditions [42]. We
therefore opted to elute immunoprecipitated proteins
through on-bead tryptic digestion under non-denaturing
conditions, to limit contamination of the immunoprecip-
itation by the anti-RNAP β-subunit antibody used to
target the RNAP complex.
To validate the ability of our approach to identify
nucleic acid-associated proteins, we demonstrated DNA
association for N-terminally FLAG-tagged MSMEG_
1060, MSMEG_2695 and MSMEG_4306. These results
are not indicative of direct DNA binding by these pro-
teins, since association with DNA may be as a result of
cross-linking to other DNA-associated proteins. Possible
DNA interaction and DNA binding sequences of these
proteins remains to be investigated using approaches
such as DNA foot printing, ChIP-seq or microscale ther-
mophoresis. No DNA association by some of the other
proteins
investigated
(MSMEG_3754
and
MSMEG_
5512) does not negate the possibility of DNA inter-
action, as the amount of DNA bound by these proteins
may be too little to visualize on an agarose gel or these
proteins may simply be RNA associated. These results
highlight the ability of our approach to identify proteins
associated with DNA and suggests that uncharacterised
proteins identified in this study could be investigated as
proteins likely to be involved in transcription or transla-
tion due to their proximity to the RNA polymerase
complex.
Conclusions
In this study, we successfully identified proteins associ-
ated with the RNAP complex under standard laboratory
growth conditions in M. smegmatis. We propose that
our AP-MS approach can successfully be applied to
study the regulation of adaptation to stress in mycobac-
terial species, and be adapted for use in other bacteria.

plates at 37 °C for 2–3 days [43]. Culture media was sup-
plemented with antibiotics kanamycin (25 μg/mL) and/
or hygromycin (50 μg/mL) as appropriate.
Chemicals, antibodies and oligonucleotides used in this
study
All chemicals used in this study were purchased from
either Sigma-Aldrich or Merck South Africa, unless
otherwise stated. Monoclonal antibodies to the beta sub-
unit of RNA polymerase from E. coli (clone 8RB13) and
human myosin heavy chain 7 (MYH7) (clone sc-53,089)
were purchased from Santa-Cruz, United States of
America (USA). A mouse derived monoclonal anti-
FLAG antibody (clone FG4R) was purchased from
Thermo Fisher Scientific and a goat anti-mouse horse-
radish peroxidase conjugated antibody (clone HAF007)
was purchased from R&D systems. Western blotting was
done to confirm the ability of the anti- RNA polymerase
β-subunit to detect the β-subunit of the RNAP complex
in M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis (Additional file 1:
Figure S6) and to verify the expression of FLAG-tagged
proteins (Additional file 1: Figure S5). Oligonucleotides

Immunoprecipitation of Nucleoproteins
M. smegmatis cultures (2 × 50 mL) grown to an OD600 of
0.4 were treated with formaldehyde (1% final concentra-
tion) for 10 min at 37 °C with shaking. Cross-linking was
quenched using glycine (final concentration 125 mM)
and cells were washed using Tris-buffered saline (20 mM
Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) prior to storage at −
80 °C. Individual cell pellets were resuspended in 4 mL
immunoprecipitation buffer I (IP buffer I) (100 mM
Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 2% Triton X-100) sup-
plemented with protease inhibitors (Roche cOmplete™
mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail). Cells were
subsequently sonicated (QSonica Q700 probe sonicator)
four times for 20 s at an amplitude of 30 with 2 min in-
tervals on ice to lyse cells. Mycobacterial DNA was fur-
ther fragmented through the addition of micrococcal
nuclease (100 U, Roche), CaCl2 (9 mM) and RNAse A
(0.002 mg/mL) followed by incubation at 4 °C for 1 h
with rotation. DNA fragmentation was stopped with the
addition of EDTA (10 mM) and insoluble cellular debris
was removed by centrifugation. Cell lysates were pooled
prior to incubation of 2 mL of cell lysate with either
50 μL of Protein G Dynabeads or 5 μg anti-RNAP β-
subunit antibody or 10 μg anti-MYH7 antibody immobi-
lized
on
50 μL
Protein
G
Dynabeads,
respectively.
Immunoprecipitations were incubated with an excess
cell lysate to fully saturate antibody binding during pull-
downs. Nucleoprotein complexes were immunoprecipi-
tated for 2 h at 4 °C, with rotation. Beads were washed
twice with IP buffer II (50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5,
150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% So-
dium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with prote-
ase inhibitors, twice with IP buffer II plus 500 mM NaCl,
twice with IP buffer II plus 750 mM NaCl, and twice
with wash buffer IV (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 250 mM
LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% IGEPAL® CA-630, 0.5% Sodium
deoxycholate). Immunoprecipitated nucleoprotein com-
plexes were subjected to on-bead tryptic digestion by in-
cubation of beads with 200 μL 50 mM ammonium
bicarbonate and 2 μg sequencing-grade modified trypsin
(Promega) for 18 h at 37 °C with shaking at 700 rpm.
Eluted peptides were desalted before mass spectrometry
analysis using in-house packed STAGE-tips. Samples
were concentrated prior to being loaded onto methanol-
activated
and
2%
acetonitrile
equilibrated
Empore™
Octadecyl C18 STAGE-tips. STAGE-tips were washed
with 2% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid prior to elu-
tion of peptides using a solution of 50% acetonitrile and
0.1% formic acid. Eluted samples were dried using a
Concentratorplus (Eppendorf) before being resuspended
in loading solvent (2% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid).
Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed in
biological triplicate experiments.
Tandem mass spectrometry analysis
Liquid chromatography was performed using a Dionex-
UltiMate 3000 Rapid Separation LC (Thermo Fisher Sci-
entific) equipped with a 2 cm × 100 μm C18 trap column
and a custom 35 cm × 75 μm C18 analytical column
(Luna C18, 5 μm, Phenomenex). Peptide samples were
loaded onto the trap column using 100% Solvent A (2%
acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min
using a temperature controlled autosampler set at 7 °C.
The trap column was washed for 10 min before elution
at 350 nL/min using the following gradient: 2–10% solv-
ent B (99.9% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid solution) over
5 min, 10–25% solvent B over 45 min, 25–45% solvent B
over 15 min, using Chromeleon™6.80 non-linear gradi-
ent 6. The column was subsequently washed for 10 min
with 80% solvent B solution followed by equilibration
using solvent A. Chromatography was performed at
50 °C and the outflow was delivered to the mass spec-
trometer through a stainless steel nano-bore emitter.
Mass spectrometry analysis was performed on the Orbi-
trap
Fusion™
Tribrid™Mass Spectrometer
(Thermo
Fisher Scientific) and data was collected in positive mode
with a spray voltage set to 2 kV and ion transfer capillary
set to 275 °C. Spectra was internally calibrated using
polysiloxane ions at m/z = 445.12003 and 371.10024. For

MS1 scan analysis, the Orbitrap detector was set to a
resolution of R = 120,000 over a scan range of 350–1650
with the AGC target at 3E5 with a maximum injection
time of 40 ms. Data was acquired in profile mode. MS2
acquisition was performed using monoisotopic precursor
selection for ion charges between + 2 and + 6 with the
error tolerance set to +/−10 ppm and the exclusion of
precursor ions from repeat fragmentation for 30 s. Pre-
cursor ions were selected for fragmentation using the
quadrupole mass analyser and fragmented using an
HCD energy of 32.5%. Fragment ions were detected
within the ion trap mass analyser using a rapid scan rate.
The AGC target was set at 1E4 with a maximum injec-
tion time of 45 ms. Data was acquired in centroid mode.
Identification of immunoprecipitated proteins
MaxQuant 1.5.0.25 was used to analyse mass spectrom-
etry data using the M. smegmatis mc2 155 database
(UP000000757) containing 8794 predicted protein en-
tries obtained from UniProt, October 2014 [44]. Carba-
midomethyl cysteine was set as a fixed modification.
Formaldehyde treatment of cells is known to result in
the modification of any free nucleophilic group and to
minimize the loss of protein identifications due to for-
maldehyde treatment, possible formaldehyde-induced
modifications were searched against LC-MS/MS data, to
determine their respective frequencies within our anti-
RNAP immunoprecipitation data (Additional file 2:
Table S1) [45, 46]. The four most frequent variable mod-
ifications (oxidized methionine, the addition of glycine
on lysine, serine and threonine residues, the addition of
methylol and glycine on any histidine, asparagine, glu-
tamine, tryptophan and tyrosine as well as the possible
di-methylation of lysine and arginine residues) were in-
cluded in our automated database search using Max-
Quant. Two missed tryptic cleavages were allowed, and
proteins were identified with a minimum of 1 unique
peptide detected per protein. The protein and peptide
false discovery rate (FDR) set at less than 0.01. Relative
quantification was performed using the MaxQuant LFQ
(MaxLFQ) algorithm in the MaxQuant package to ob-
tain LFQ intensity values for identified protein groups
and the “match between runs” algorithm was selected to
detect peptides which were not selected for MS/MS ana-
lysis in other experiments [47]. LFQ intensity data for
identified proteins from the proteinGroups.txt file was
used for statistical analyses using Perseus [47, 48]. All
potential contaminants, reverse hits and proteins only
identified by site were removed before log 2 transform-
ation and filtering to remove all proteins identified with
only one unique peptide [49]. Hierarchical clustering in
Perseus was done using the principal component analysis
function to demonstrate separate clustering of control im-
munoprecipitations to anti-RNAP immunoprecipitations
for protein groups identified with at least two unique
peptides.
Proteins were deemed enriched when present in at
least two of the three anti-RNAP immunoprecipitations.
Hierarchical clustering of data was performed using
Heatmapper (http://heatmapper.ca/) to demonstrate sep-
arate clustering of anti-RNAP and control immunopre-
cipitations and to visually asses the identification of
contaminant proteins [50]. A list of high confidence pro-
teins was generated for all proteins identified in two of
the three anti-RNAP immunoprecipitations but not in
any of the control immunoprecipitations (protein G
Dynabead and anti-MYH7 Dynabead controls). Follow-
ing the removal of high confidence proteins from the
dataset, the data was imputed using the “replace missing
values from normal distribution” function. A multiple-
sample test ANOVA between groups (group 1: anti-
RNAP IP, group 2: anti-MYH7 IP, group 3: protein G
Dynabead IP) with an FDR of 0.05 was performed using
the Benjamini-Hochberg correction. Low confidence
proteins were identified as significantly more abundant
within the anti-RNAP IPs vs. the control IPs, with a
fold-change of at least 2. Identification of specific protein
interactions were assessed using CRAPome to identify
non-specific protein interactions. CRAPome identified
the majority of low confidence and contaminant proteins
(Supplementary CRAPome analysis) [51]. All high and
low confidence proteins identified with a minimum of 2
unique peptides were subjected to manual spectral inspec-
tion. Several proteins were excluded due to poor posterior
error probability scores (PEP), major unexplained peaks,
poor peptide coverage or low intensity peaks. Identifying
characteristics like MS/MS count, number of unique
peptides, variable modifications and identifying peptides
of all high and low confidence proteins are described in
Additional file 2: Table S3 and Table S4.
MSMEG annotations and protein descriptions of identi-
fied proteins were assigned using Uniprot (http://www.Uni
Prot.org/) [52]. Gene ontology enrichment analysis was
done using the Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis Soft-
ware Toolkit (GOEAST) (http://omicslab.genetics.ac.cn/
GOEAST/) followed by removal of redundant GO identifi-
cations
using
Reduce
and
Visualize
Gene
Ontology
(REVIGO) (http://revigo.irb.hr/) [26, 27]. Functional anno-
tation network graphs generated by REVIGO was visualized
using Cytoscape 3.3.0 [28] and to demonstrate the enrich-
ment of GO terms associated with nucleic acids we gener-
ated
graphs
by
searching
for
the
identifiers
DNA,
chromosome, transcription, gene, RNA, ribosome, transla-
tion, nucleotide as well as their first connecting neighbours.
Creation of FLAG-tagged protein plasmids
A FLAG-tag and 6x glycine linker was synthesized as
part of primer NFLAG0615 f, which was used to PCR

amplify MSMEG_0615 together with primer NFLAG0615
r (Additional file 2: Table S9). The resulting fragment was
cloned into a modified pSE100 backbone plasmid, which
contained
a
ribosome
binding
sequence,
to
create
pNFLAG0615. To generate a FLAG-tag only containing
plasmid, the insert MSMEG_0615 was excised using NdeI
and HindIII, prior to blunting with the Klenow fragment.
M. smegmatis genes of interest, MSMEG_1060, MSMEG_
2695, MSMEG_3754, MSMEG_4306 and MSMEG_5512
were PCR amplified using primers described in Additional
file 2: Table S9. Genes of interest were cloned into the
linearized pNFLAG0615 plasmid using the In-Fusion® HD
Cloning kit. Gene sequence integrity was verified using
Sanger sequencing, performed on an ABI 3730XL DNA
Analyser at the Central Analytical Facilities, Stellenbosch
University, South Africa. pNFLAG plasmids were co-
transformed with pTEK-4S-0X into M. smegmatis. All
plasmids used or generated in this study are described in
Additional file 2: Table S10.
DNA association assay
Expression of N-terminally FLAG-tagged proteins were
confirmed by western blotting. Cell lysates were col-
lected from M. smegmatis mc2155 and M. smegmatis
pNFLAG, pNFLAG0615, pNFLAG2695, pNFLAG3754,
pNFLAG4306 and pNFLAG5512 transformants. Samples
were separated on 4–12% gradient SDS-PAGE gels be-
fore being transferred to a PVDF membrane and probed
using an anti-FLAG antibody (1:4000) and a goat anti-
mouse secondary antibody (1:10000).
Overnight cultured M. smegmatis strains expressing
the FLAG-tagged proteins were cross-linked and lysed
as described above. The FLAG-tagged proteins were
immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using 5 μg of
mouse
anti-FLAG
primary
antibody
(clone
FG4R)
immobilized on protein G Dynabeads™. Antibody-bound
beads were incubated with 2 mL cell lysate for 2 h at
4 °C before being washed as previously described. Cross-
linking was reversed by incubating beads in 100 μL elu-
tion buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 1%
SDS) for 1 h at 65 °C. Proteins were digested with pro-
teinase K prior to NaCl - ethanol DNA precipitation.
DNA was resuspended in 20 μL TE buffer (10 mM Tris-
HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA) prior to separation on an
agarose gel.

Western blotting was used to confirm the expression of FLAG-tagged M.
smegmatis proteins using an anti-FLAG antibody. Full length FLAG-
MSMEG_0615, FLAG-MSMEG_2695, FLAG-MSMEG_3754, FLAG-
MSMEG_4306 and FLAG-MSMEG_5512 was detected. HupB is known to
form a homodimer and FLAG-MSMEG_2389 could be located at ~ 35 kDa
instead of at 22.7 kDa. Likewise FLAG-MSMEG_1060, which shares a high
level of sequence similarity with Lsr2 and is also known to form a homo-
dimer, could be identified at ~ 25 kDa and not at 15.83 kDa. Figure S6.
