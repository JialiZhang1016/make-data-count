New benzoyl thiourea derivatives and their nickel and copper complexes were synthesized. The structure of the synthesized
compounds were confirmed by elemental analysis, FT-IR, and 1H NMR techniques. Four of the synthesized compounds are
analyzed by X-ray single crystal diffraction technique. Whereas N,N-dimethyl-N󸀠-(4-fluorobenzoyl)thiourea, N,N-diethyl-N󸀠-(4-
fluorobenzoyl)thiourea, and N,N-di-n-butyl-N󸀠-(4-fluorobenzoyl) thiourea crystallize in the monoclinic system, bis(N,N-di-n-
propyl-N󸀠-(4-fluorobenzoyl)thioureato) nickel(II) complex crystallizes in the triclinic system. These ligand molecules form dimers
through strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds such as N–H⋅⋅⋅S, C–H⋅⋅⋅O, and N–H⋅⋅⋅O. Moreover, there are different types of
intramolecular interactions in the crystal structures. Bis(N,N-dimethyl-N󸀠-(4-fluorobenzoyl)thioureato) nickel(II) complex has a
nearly square-planar coordination. The distance of nickel atom from the best plane through the coordination sphere is 0.029 ˚A.
1. Introduction
The role of benzoyl thioureas derivatives in coordination
chemistry has been extensively studied and quite satisfactory
elucidated. Because benzoyl thioureas have suitable C=O
and C=S function groups, they can be considered as useful
chelating agents due to their ability to encapsulate into their
coordinating moiety metal ions [1]. Therefore, new thiourea
derivatives and their structures have received attention of
several research groups because of their complexation capac-
ity [2–5]. Some derivatives are biologically active, such as
antifungal [6, 7], antitumour [8–10], antiviral, antibacterial
[11–13], pharmacological [14], herbicidal, and insecticidal
properties [11–13]. In addition, some of the research groups
have reported thermal behaviour [15–18] and the acidity
constants [19] of ligands of some benzoylthiourea derivatives
and their metal complexes [20–30].
In addition, fluorine-containing organic compounds have
been frequently applied to biorelated materials, medicines,
and agrochemicals because of their unique properties, such
as high thermal stability and lipophilicity [20].
There are many reasons for the interest in such molecules.
In the present study, we combined thiourea group with
fluorine-containing organic compound and report the prepa-
ration and characterization of five new N,N-dialkyl-N-(4-
fluorobenzoyl) thiourea compounds (alkyl: methyl (HL1),
ethyl (HL2), n-propyl (HL3), n-butyl (HL4), and phenyl
(HL5)) which include a fluorine atom and their Ni(II) and
Cu(II) complexes (Scheme 1). The crystal and molecular
structures of HL1, HL2, HL4, and Ni(L3)2 were characterized
by single crystal X-ray diffraction.
2. Experimental
2.1. Instrumentation. Melting points were recorded on elec-
trothermal model 9200 apparatus. C, H, and N analyses were
carried out on a Carlo Erba MOD 1106 elemental analyzer.

Scheme 1: Synthesized compounds.
Infrared measurement was recorded in the range 400–
4000 cm−1 on Satellite FT-IR equipped with a WINFIRST
LITE software package form Mattson Instruments. The 1H
NMR spectrums were recorded in CDCl3 solvent on Bruker-
400 MHz spectrophotometer using tetramethylsilane as an
internal reference. Single crystal X-ray diffraction data were
collected on an Enraf-Nonius CAD 4 diffractometer and
on a Bruker AXS SMART APEX CCD diffractometer using
monochromated, MoK𝛼(𝜆= 0.71073 ˚A) radiation.
2.2. Reagents. 4-Fluorobenzoyl chloride, potassium thiocy-
anate, dimethylamine, diethylamine, di-n-propylamine, di-n-
butylamine, and diphenylamine were purchased from Merck
and used as received. Acetone and dichloromethane used
without further purification. Ethanol was dried and distilled
before the using.
2.3. General Procedure for the Synthesis of Ligands. A solution
of 4-flourobenzoyl chloride (0.01 mol, 0.12 mL) in anhydrous
acetone (50 mL) was added dropwise to a suspension of dry
potassium thiocyanate (0.01 mol, 9718 g) in acetone (50 mL),
and the reaction mixture was refluxed for 45 min. After
cooling to room temperature, a solution of secondary amine
(0.01 mol) in anhydrous acetone (50 mL) was added, and
the resulting mixture refluxed for 2 h. Hydrochloric acid
(0.1 M, 300 mL) was added, and the solution was filtered.
The solid product was washed with water and purified by
recrystallization from an ethanol : dichloromethane mixture
(1 : 3) (Scheme 2).

2.5. X-Ray Crystallography. The crystal structure of the syn-
thesized four new compounds was solved by direct methods
using SHELXS-97, and refinements were performed with
SHELXL-97 [31]. Full-matrix least-squares refinement is
based on F2. All nonhydrogen atoms were refined anisotrop-
ically. In three compounds, the hydrogen atom of N1 was
found in difference Fourier map and refined isotropically.
All other hydrogen atoms were positioned geometrically to
their idealized positions, C–H = 0.93 (aromatic), 0.96 (CH3),
and 0.97 (CH2) ˚A, and refined with a “riding model” with
isotropic displacement parameters. Crystal data and details
of the structural determinations for ligands (HL1, HL2, and

with an equimolar amount of potassium thiocyanate in dry
acetone. All benzoylthiourea derivatives (HL1–HL5) were
synthesized from 4-fluorobenzoyl isothiocyanate and sec-
ondary amines in dry acetone. Scheme 2 outlines the synthe-
sis of the series of thiourea derivatives. The ligands were puri-
fied by recrystallization from an ethanol : dichloromethane
mixture (1 : 2) and obtained in yields ranging from 67 to
94%. 1H NMR spectra, FT-IR spectra, and elemental analysis
data of all synthesized compounds confirm the proposed
structures.
The reaction of the ligands with nickel acetate or
copper acetate at room temperature with ethanol as sol-
vent yielded the new complexes (ML2, M=Cu, or Ni).
All the new metal complexes were recrystallized from
ethanol : dichloromethane mixture (1 : 1). The proposed struc-
tures given in Scheme 1 are consistent with the analytical and
spectroscopic data.
FT-IR spectra were taken with KBr pellets between 4000
and 400 cm−1. In the FT-IR spectra of the synthesized ben-
zoylthiourea derivatives show sharp and strong absorption
band at 3231, 3293, 3271, 3166, and 3159 cm−1 for HL1, HL2,
HL3, HL4, and HL5 attributed to the stretching vibration of
N–H group, respectively [11, 12, 21, 22, 24–28].
The strong C=O stretching vibration band was observed
in the range of 1643–1690 cm−1, which is in agreement
with the literature data [11, 12, 21, 22, 24–28]. In addition,
synthesized compounds show weak intensity C=S stretching
vibration in the 1251–1296 cm−1 range [11, 12, 21, 22, 24–28].
All IR spectra of metallic complexes are practically
similar. The N–H stretching vibration, present in the ligand
around ∼3200 cm−1, disappears in the complex spectra. At the
same time, a new peak appeared in the range 1485–1500 cm−1,
which was attributed to the absorption of C–O stretching
vibration band. In the spectra of complexes, there is another
intense absorption band at 1596–1602 cm−1 corresponding to
the C–N fragment. All this conclusions are in agreement with
the literature [11, 12, 21, 22, 24–28].
The 1H NMR spectra of the ligands are consistent with
their structures. The 1H NMR spectrum of ligands exhibited
broad signals at 8.58, 8.41, 8.42, 8.14, and 8.64 for HL1, HL2,
HL3, HL4, and HL5, respectively, due to NH protons. This
peak does not appear in Ni(II) and Cu(II) complexes. These
data are in agreement with the IR spectra and literature

3.2. X-Ray Crystal Structures. We used X-ray single crystal
diffraction method to determine and confirm the structure
of the synthesized compounds. Only four of the synthesized
compounds were suitable for X-ray single crystal diffraction.
The molecular structures of HL1, HL2, HL4, and Ni(L3)2 are
depicted in Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Selected bond
lengths and angles are listed in Tables 2 and 3.
In each ligand, F atom is coplanar with the C1–C6 ring.
The C2–C1–C7–O1 torsion angles set up by aromatic ring and
the carbonyl group are 25.3(3), 5.0(3), and −20.3(4)∘, for HL1,
HL2, and HL4, respectively. The molecules of compounds
HL1 and HL4 are effectively nonplanar, as shown by the values
of the N1–C7–C1–C6 torsion angle, respectively, (Table 2);
this angle defines the rotation of the aryl ring relative to
the rest of the molecule. Within the thiourea moieties of
compounds HL1, HL2, and HL4, the geometry at the carbon
atoms is ideally planar, with a sum of the bond angles at C8
in HL1, HL2, and HL4 of 360.0(2), 360.0(2), and 359.9(2)∘,
respectively. The S1 atom is out of the plane of the N–C–N
thiourea bridge by 0.051(1) ˚A in HL1, 0.029(1) ˚A in HL2,
and 0.075(1) ˚A in compound HL4. The thiourea moiety

angle of 80.9(1), 89.0(1) and 84.6(1)∘for HL1, HL2, and HL4,
respectively. In all ligands, the fluorobenzoyl ring and one of
the methyl, ethyl, and n-butyl groups are trans to S1, but the
other methyl, ethyl, and n-butyl groups are cis with respect to
N2–C8 thiourea bond.
Bond distances and bond angles of the thiourea group
agree well with those expected from other thiourea deriva-
tives [22, 28–30, 32–34]. The C7–O1 and C8–S1 bonds both
show typical double-bound character with bond lengths of
1.212(2) for HL1, 1.225(2) for HL2, and 1.219(3) for HL4 and

respectively. The C8–N2 and C7–N1 bonds also indicate a
partial double bound character. These bonds due to their

vicinity to the carbonyl group and methyl, ethyl, and n-butyl
groups are slightly shorter in compound HL2 and HL4, but
C7–N1 bond is almost the same as compared to the C8–
N1 in compound HL1. The elongation of C8–N1 relative
to C8–N2 and C7–N1 in compound HL2 and HL4 is in
agreement with other thiourea derivatives [3, 32, 35–39].
All the other bond lengths fall within the expected ranges
[34]. The conformation of the molecule with respect to the
thiocarbonyl and carbonyl moieties is twisted, as reflected
by the torsion angles C8–N1–C7–O1 and C7–N1–C8–S1 of
−1.6(3) and −127.0(2), −5.9(3) and 91.8(2), and −0.9(4) and
120.4(2)∘for HL1, HL2, and HL4, respectively.
There are different kinds of interactions in the benzoyl
thiourea compounds, but N–H⋅⋅⋅S, C–H⋅⋅⋅O, and N–H⋅⋅⋅O
intermolecular hydrogen bonds play a dominant role in
the stabilities of crystal structures. The molecules of HL1,
HL2, and HL4 are packed in a centrosymmetric manner
through weak N–H⋅⋅⋅S and C–H⋅⋅⋅O hydrogen bonding.
In compound HL1, crystal packing shows dimeric units
formed through the N2–H2⋅⋅⋅S1 and C2–H7⋅⋅⋅O1 hydrogen
bonds. The short C9–H9C⋅⋅⋅S1, C10–H10A⋅⋅⋅O1, and C10–
H10C⋅⋅⋅N2 distances of 2.50, 2.44, and 2.44 ˚A point out
the presence of intramolecular hydrogen interactions. In
compound HL2, crystal packing shows intermolecular N1–
H1N⋅⋅⋅O1 hydrogen bonds and molecules again form dimers.
Intramolecular C9–H9A⋅⋅⋅S1 hydrogen bonds are also sim-
ilar to those in compound HL1. In compound HL4, the
crystal packing shows intermolecular N1–H1N⋅⋅⋅S1 and C2–
H2⋅⋅⋅O hydrogen bonds and molecules again form dimers.
Intramolecular C–H⋅⋅⋅O and C–H⋅⋅⋅S hydrogen bonds are
also similar to those in compounds HL1 and HL2. Hydrogen
bonding and short contact geometry for three compounds
HL1, HL2, and HL4 are given in Table 4.

All of the structural data of the nickel complex agree
with the elemental analysis, FT-IR spectroscopy, and 1H
NMR spectroscopy data. Bis(N,N-dimethyl-N󸀠-4-floro ben-
zoyl thioureato) nickel(II) complex has a nearly square-
planar coordination at the nickel atom. The distance of nickel
atom from the best plane through the coordination sphere is
0.029 ˚A. The bond lengths of the carbonyl and thiocarbonyl
groups lie between those for double and single bonds, a
feature which is known from related structures (O1–C8:
1.271(8) ˚A; O2–C22: 1.271(7) ˚A; S1–C1: 1.729(7) ˚A; S2–C15:
1.745(7) ˚A) [11, 12, 21, 22, 40, 41] (Table 3). The bond length
C1–N2 is 1.342(8) and N(2)–C(8) 1.340(8) ˚A. The bond length
is C–N shorter than a normal single C–N bond. This is due to
strong delocalization in the chelate rings [42–44].
4. Conclusions
In this work, five flourobenzoyl thiourea ligands and their
Ni(II) and Cu(II) complexes have been synthesized and
characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy, and 1H
NMR. Crystal and molecular structures of three synthesized
ligands and one metal complex were analyzed by X-ray
single crystal diffraction method. The comparative analysis
was performed with literature data. The structure of these
compounds is consistent with the structure of other thiourea
derivatives. The bond lengths and angles also agree well
with other thiourea derivatives. In the crystal structure,
intermolecular N–H⋅⋅⋅S, C–H⋅⋅⋅O, and N–H⋅⋅⋅O hydrogen
bonds seem to be effective in the stabilization of the structure.
In all ligands, molecules form dimers through strong inter-
molecular hydrogen bonds.
