Abstract
Background: It is unclear whether germline breast cancer susceptibility gene mutations affect breast cancer related
outcomes. We wanted to evaluate mutation patterns in 20 breast cancer susceptibility genes and correlate the mutations
with clinical characteristics to determine the effects of these germline mutations on breast cancer prognosis.
Methods: The study cohort included 480 ethnic Chinese individuals in Taiwan with at least one of the six clinical risk
factors for hereditary breast cancer: family history of breast or ovarian cancer, young age of onset for breast cancer,
bilateral breast cancer, triple negative breast cancer, both breast and ovarian cancer, and male breast cancer. PCR-
enriched amplicon-sequencing on a next generation sequencing platform was used to determine the germline DNA
sequences of all exons and exon-flanking regions of the 20 genes. Protein-truncating variants were identified as
pathogenic.
Results: We detected a 13.5% carrier rate of pathogenic germline mutations, with BRCA2 being the most prevalent and the
non-BRCA genes accounting for 38.5% of the mutation carriers. BRCA mutation carriers were more likely to be diagnosed of
breast cancer with lymph node involvement (66.7% vs 42.6%; P = 0.011), and had significantly worse breast cancer specific
outcomes. The 5-year disease-free survival was 73.3% for BRCA mutation carriers and 91.1% for non-carriers (hazard ratio for
recurrence or death 2.42, 95% CI 1.29–4.53; P = 0.013). After adjusting for clinical prognostic factors, BRCA mutation
remained an independent poor prognostic factor for cancer recurrence or death (adjusted hazard ratio 3.04, 95% CI 1.
40–6.58; P = 0.005). Non-BRCA gene mutation carriers did not exhibit any significant difference in cancer characteristics
or outcomes compared to those without detected mutations. Among the risk factors for hereditary breast cancer, the
odds of detecting a germline mutation increased significantly with having bilateral breast cancer (adjusted odds ratio 3.
27, 95% CI 1.64–6.51; P = 0.0008) or having more than one risk factor (odds ratio 2.07, 95% CI 1.22–3.51; P = 0.007).
Conclusions: Without prior knowledge of the mutation status, BRCA mutation carriers had more advanced breast
cancer on initial diagnosis and worse cancer-related outcomes. Optimal approach to breast cancer treatment for BRCA
mutation carriers warrants further investigation.

Background
Multigene panel testing is increasingly adopted for man-
aging breast cancer susceptibility in high risk individuals
suspected of having hereditary breast cancer, but the
evidence-based practice guidelines remain far from being
comprehensive. The advent of next generation sequencing
(NGS) technologies is making multigene panel testing eas-
ier and affordable [1–4]. In addition, multigene panel test-
ing could identify up to 50% more individuals with cancer
susceptibility gene mutations in comparison with testing
only for BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA) [5]. Most of these
additional mutations are from moderate risk genes, many
of which could result in alterations of cancer risk estima-
tion and clinical action [5, 6]. However, arriving at consist-
ent and optimal clinical recommendations on the basis of
the interpretations of the multigene panel testing and
associated variants of uncertain significance (VUS) could

be challenging due to lack of comprehensive understand-
ing on the consequences of the genetic alterations [7]. As
the multigene panel testing is becoming widely adopted,
studies are needed to develop evidence-based practice
guidelines.
In addition to risk assessment of breast cancer suscep-
tibility in germline mutation carriers, understanding
prognosis after breast cancer diagnosis will also impact
practice guidelines for breast cancer. With the efficacy
of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in
controlling BRCA mutation positive tumors, many clin-
ical trials are now underway evaluating their use in
breast cancer [8]; their incorporation into systemic ther-
apy in clinical practice is highly anticipated. It has not
been established whether BRCA or any cancer suscepti-
bility gene mutation is an independent prognostic factor
after breast cancer diagnosis. Despite the suspicion for a
more aggressive tumor phenotype, most studies have
fallen short of showing differences in clinical outcomes
in BRCA mutation carriers [9–12]. Systematic reviews
with larger pooled sample size have yielded conflicting
conclusions, possibly due to variability of included stud-
ies [13–15]. Consequently, conventional decisions re-
garding systemic therapy for BRCA mutation-associated
breast cancer have been based on disease characteristics
rather than BRCA mutation status. As such, it would be
informative to discover causal or statistical correlations
of germline breast cancer susceptibility gene mutations
to breast cancer prognosis.
A panel of 20 known and candidate breast cancer sus-
ceptibility genes were selected herein for the multigene
panel testing study. Among the 20 genes, BRCA1,
BRCA2, PALB2, TP53, CDH1, PTEN, ATM, CHEK2,
BARD1, STK11, NBN have been well established as
breast cancer susceptibility genes [7, 16, 17]. Some are
part of rare high-penetrance cancer predisposing syn-
dromes (e.g. BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, CDH1, PTEN,
STK11, PALB2) while others are moderate-penetrance
genes (e.g. ATM, NBN, CHEK2, BARD1). The impacts of
the mutations in RAD50, RAD51C, and RAD51D on
breast cancer susceptibility and survival are controver-
sial: Mutations in RAD50 have been found not associ-
ated with breast cancer risk [17]. Also mutations in
RAD51C have not been found to increase the risk of
breast cancer [18–20] and mutations in RAD51D have
been associated with high risk of ovarian cancer but not
with breast cancer [21]. Nevertheless, other studies have
indicated that mutations in RAD51C [22] and RAD51D
[17, 23, 24] contribute to the risk of both breast and
ovarian cancer, and that RAD50 is an intermediate-risk
breast cancer susceptibility gene [25]. Although germline
mutations in the DNA mismatch repair genes (MLH1,
MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) have been mostly associated with
Lynch syndrome, evidence has been established to
support the connections between the mutations in the
DNA mismatch repair genes and the risk or survival of
breast cancer [26–29]. Similarly, whether BRIP1 is a
breast cancer susceptibility gene remains controversial
[30], and perhaps is dependent on the ethnicity of the
cohort studied [22]. NF1 mutations have been known to
associate with increased risk of breast cancer in younger
population [31] and poor breast cancer survival [32]. To
clarify the controversies, we included in the panel the
potentially relevant genes above to explore the germline
mutation-dependence of breast cancer predisposition
and outcomes in our local high risk population.
Different ethnic populations need respective studies on
cancer risks pertinent to germline mutations. In the west-
ern populations, about 5% of the breast cancer patients
may carry heritable cancer susceptibility gene mutations
[33, 34]. BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for the majority of
these gene mutations, with BRCA1 being the most com-
mon [34, 35]. However, studies in Asian populations have
indicated somewhat different conclusions: available results
show that BRCA mutation rates in Asians are lower than
those in Whites, and that the distributions of the gene
mutations are also different [36–43]. It is imperative to en-
rich mutation databases on different ethnic populations,
so as to better interpret ethnically specific germline muta-
tions and better manage cancer risks among correspond-
ing ethnic populations.
In this study, we analyzed germline mutations in the
20 breast cancer susceptibility genes using NGS-based
technique in a cohort of high risk ethnic Chinese popu-
lation. We evaluated the correlation of mutations with
clinical characteristics and cancer outcomes. We aimed
to clarify the prognostic value of BRCA and other breast
cancer susceptibility gene mutations on breast cancer
specific outcomes after conventional cancer treatment.

Center
(KF-
SYSCC) treats over 1000 newly diagnosed breast cancer
patients annually. Between July 30, 2015 and March 31,
2016, we enrolled 480 individuals fulfilling at least one
of the six eligibility criteria: family history of breast or
ovarian cancer at any age (2 or more individuals on the
same lineage of the family), personal history of breast
cancer with age of diagnosis less than or equal to 40, bi-
lateral breast cancer diagnosed at the same time or se-
quentially, triple negative (ER/PR/HER2 negative) breast
cancer, breast and ovarian cancer in the same individual,
and male breast cancer. None of the participants had
known mutation status in any cancer susceptibility genes
prior to enrollment. Clinical information was collected
through participant surveys, electronic medical records,
and the institutional breast cancer database.

Sequencing and variant analyses of cancer susceptibility
genes in genomic DNA
Germline DNA sequencing of all exonal regions was done
in twenty breast cancer susceptibility genes: BRCA1,
BRCA2, PTEN, TP53, CDH1, STK11, NF1, NBN, MLH1,
MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, ATM, BRIP1, CHEK2, PALB2,
RAD50, BARD1, RAD51C, and RAD51D. Polymerase
chain reaction (PCR)-enriched amplicon-sequencing on
an NGS platform was used to sequence genomic DNA ex-
tracted from whole blood or frozen buffy coat samples
using the Gentra Puregene Blood kit (Qiagen, Minneap-
olis, MN, USA). The DNA samples were first PCR ampli-
fied using the Qiagen GeneRead DNAseq custom panel
primer sets for the 20 genes, covering all exons as well as
at least 10-base exon-flanking regions. The Qiagen primer
set included 1184 amplicons and provided at least 90%
coverage for most genes except for STK11 (59%), PMS2
(74%) and MSH2 (89%). PCR enriched amplicons were
end-repaired, adenylated, and ligated to NEXTflex-96
DNA barcodes (Bioo Scientific, Austin, Texas, USA) using
the Qiagen GeneRead DNA Library I Core Kit. Barcoded
libraries were amplified using the Qiagen GeneRead DNA
I Amp Kit and NEXTflex primers (Bioo Scientific). Quality
control and quantification of libraries were performed
using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kit and the Agilent
DNA 1000 kit. The barcoded DNA libraries were pooled
in equal amounts and underwent 2x150bp paired-end se-
quencing on an Illumina MiSeq platform. The average
base call error rates were less than 1.0%.
We constructed a pipeline based on public domain soft-
ware and databases for alignment, variant calling, and an-
notation, using GRCh37 as the reference genome. BWA
(http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/) was used to map reads to
the reference genome. Bam-readcount (https://github.com/
genome/bam-readcount) was used to count variants for
each aligned position. Variant calling protocols were carried
out either based on GATK Best Practices (https://softwar-
e.broadinstitute.org/gatk/best-practices/) or using a non-
GATK based algorithm, where lower limits of 50 for read
depth and 10% for proportion of raw reads with a variant
were used for variant calling. Variants that were intergenic,
intronic (except for the 10 bp exon-flanking regions), or
synonymous (sense) were excluded. All other variants iden-
tified with the two algorithms were compared, and discrep-
ant variants were manually inspected by viewing the BAM
reads using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV, Broad
Institute, Inc.) to decide on the validity of the variant. The
variants were searched in the dbSNP database (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/) and the ClinVar database
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/). Variants were anno-
tated as pathogenic, uncertain significance, or benign, using
variant-dependent
methods
and
disease-dependent
methods. Nonsense, frameshift, and splice-site mutations
that result in a truncated protein product were classified as
pathogenic. The clinical significance interpretation on Clin-
Var, if available, was referenced for categorization. Novel
missense mutations not found in the public databases were
classified as variants of uncertain significance. We used
various in silico models (Align-GVGD [44], PolyPhen-2
[45], SIFT [46], PROVEAN [47], CADD [48]) to evaluate
the deleteriousness of the variants, especially missense vari-
ants. However, we did not change classification based on
the in silico models. As the interpretation of missense vari-
ants is often controversial [7], we took a more conservative
approach of only including the protein-truncating variants
in the clinical correlation of this study. All variants classi-
fied as pathogenic were further verified using the Sanger se-
quencing
method,
confirming
they
were
germline
mutations.
Detection of large genomic rearrangement using copy
number variation (CNV) analyses
Coverage or read depth has been used to detect CNVs
in genome-scale (whole genome sequencing) datasets.
Multiplex PCR-based enrichment focuses sequencing ef-
forts on a very small fraction of the genome, and the ob-
served read depth for each of the regions can differ due
to varying number of PCR amplicons, sequence vari-
ation, or PCR enrichment efficiency. For CNV detection
in our PCR-enriched amplicon sequencing data of the
20 genes, we used two algorithms, Quandico [49] and
ONCOCNV [50], specifically developed for CNV ana-
lysis of amplicon sequencing data. The CNVs detected
with these algorithms were then verified experimentally
using the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplifica-
tion (MLPA) technique. This analysis resulted in the dis-
covery of two carriers of a BRCA1 large genomic
rearrangement (LGR) in the study cohort.
Clinical correlation and statistical analyses
For study participants who have had breast cancer, tumor
characteristics and clinical outcomes were extracted from
the institutional breast cancer database and participant
survey. Correlation statistics between clinical characteris-
tics and BRCA mutation or non-BRCA mutation status
were performed using the Chi-square test or t test.
For the correlation analyses of clinical outcomes and
germline mutations, we performed survival analyses
using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional haz-
ards regression analysis. The primary end point was
disease-free survival, defined as the time from breast
cancer surgery to the first appearance of one of the fol-
lowing: invasive recurrence of breast cancer (local, re-
gional,
or
distant)
or
death
without
breast-cancer
recurrence. Secondary end points included the following:
time interval without breast cancer recurrence, defined
as the time from breast cancer surgery to the recurrence
of invasive breast cancer (local, regional, or distant); time
Wang et al. BMC Cancer  (2018) 18:315 
Page 3 of 13
interval before a recurrence of breast cancer at a distant
site, defined as the time from breast cancer surgery to
the recurrence of breast cancer at a distant site; and
overall survival, defined as the time from breast cancer
surgery to death from any cause. For patients who did
not have an end-point event, the times were censored at
the date of the last follow-up visit (or for the analysis of
overall survival, the date at which the patient was last
known to be alive).
The above primary and secondary end points of the
groups with different mutation status were compared
using Kaplan-Meier curves, and the statistical signifi-
cance was evaluated using the log-rank test. Cox propor-
tional hazards regression analysis was used to evaluate
univariate and multivariate hazard ratios (HR) for BRCA
germline mutation for the end points. The covariates for
the multivariate analyses included: tumor size > 2 cm,
lymph node positivity, triple negative tumor type, young
age of onset (≤40), mastectomy (vs breast-conserving
surgery), adjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant radiotherapy,
and hormonal therapy.
The six eligibility criteria for study enrollment were con-
sidered clinical risk factors for having a germline mutation
in the cancer susceptibility genes sequenced. The odds ra-
tios (OR) of having a pathogenic germline mutation were
calculated using multivariable logistic regression with the
six dichotomous risk factors as independent variables, and
having a pathogenic germline mutation as the dependent
variable. The odds ratios for the number of risk factors
were obtained by logistic regression. Statistical significance
was represented as 95% confidence intervals and P-values.
An alpha level of 0.05 was defined as statistically signifi-
cant for rejecting the null hypothesis. All analyses were
performed using SAS 9.4® (SAS Institute, Cory, NC, USA).
Results
Study population
All 480 individuals in the study cohort were ethnically
Chinese. In the cohort, 95.4% (458 individuals) had a
personal history of breast cancer. The mean age of onset
for breast cancer was 41.8 (range 17–82). The propor-
tions (numbers) of individuals with each risk factor were:
family history 47.5% (228), age of onset ≤40 54.2% (260),
bilateral breast cancer 11.3% (54), triple-negative breast
cancer 26.5% (127), breast and ovarian cancer in the
same woman 0.8% (4), and male breast cancer 1.3% (6).
Characteristics of the germline mutations
To survey the breast cancer susceptibility gene muta-
tions, we sequenced the panel of 20 genes from all indi-
viduals in the study cohort. We identified 47 pathogenic
mutations carried in 65 individuals - a detection rate of
13.5% in 11 genes and 8.3% (40) in BRCA genes in this
high risk population. Pathogenic mutations in BRCA2
were the most prevalent, comprising 52.3% (34) of the
65 pathogenic mutation carriers (Fig. 1); individuals with
BRCA1 mutations were only 9.2% (6). PALB2 was the
second most common gene to have pathogenic muta-
tions with 13.8% (9) carrier rate. Non-BRCA gene muta-
tions contributed to 38.5% (25) - a significant portion of
the pathogenic mutation carriers.
A substantial portion of the pathogenic mutations are
novel. Table 1 summarizes the 47 identified pathogenic
mutations, which contain 15 nonsense, 28 frameshift, 3
splice-site variants, and 1 large genomic rearrangement
(multiple exon deletion). Seventeen (36.2%) of the patho-
genic mutations have not been recorded in the dbSNP
database, designated as novel variants. We also identified
173 variants of uncertain significance (VUS), of which
45 (26.0%) were novel; 183 (38.1%) in the study cohort
carried at least one VUS.
Correlation of mutations with tumor characteristics
To characterize the clinical feature upon cancer diagno-
sis in the germline mutation carriers, we compared clin-
ical characteristics among 3 subgroups of the cohort
with different mutation status. Among the 457 patients
with breast cancer characteristics and clinical outcomes
available, the tumor characteristics of those with BRCA
mutation or with non-BRCA mutation are compared
with those without any detected pathogenic germline
mutation in Table 2A. None of the patients had prior
knowledge of cancer susceptibility gene mutation status
at the time of their breast cancer diagnosis or treatment.
Those carrying BRCA mutations were more likely to
have lymph node involvement upon initial breast cancer
diagnosis when compared with those without mutations
(66.7% vs 42.6%; P = 0.011). Probably as a result, more
BRCA mutation carriers received chemotherapy (100%

breast conserving surgery (80.6% vs 62.1%; P = 0.028).
Other cancer characteristics, including age of onset,
tumor size, overall stage, estrogen receptor, HER2 over-
expression, nuclear grade, lymphovascular invasion, re-
ceipt of radiotherapy or hormonal therapy, did not show
statistically significant difference in the BRCA mutation
carriers, as compared with those without mutations. In
the non-BRCA mutation carrying breast cancer patients,
all tumor characteristics were statistically indistinguish-
able from those of the breast cancer patients without
germline mutations.
Clinical outcomes
To evaluate the prognostic value of BRCA germline mu-
tation in breast cancer patients, we performed survival
analyses comparing carriers and non-carriers of BRCA
germline mutation for various clinical end points (Fig. 2).
After a median follow-up of 66.9 months, 66 patients
(14.4%) had breast cancer recurrence or died. The rate
of disease-free survival at 5 years was 73.3% among
BRCA mutation carriers, as compared with 91.1% among
non-carriers (hazard ratio for recurrence or death 2.42,
95% CI 1.29–4.53; P = 0.013) (Fig. 2a). At 5 years, 73.3%
of the BRCA mutation carriers were free from any breast
cancer recurrence, as compared with 91.0% of the non-
carriers (hazard ratio for recurrence 2.22, 95% CI 1.20–
4.47; P = 0.016) (Fig. 2b). Distant recurrence of breast
cancer was reported in 47 patients (10.3%), and at
5 years, 79.7% of the BRCA mutation carriers were free
from distant metastasis, as compared with 94.2% of the
non-carriers (hazard ratio for distant recurrence 2.58,
95% CI 1.24–5.94; P = 0.011) (Fig. 2c). Death was re-
ported in 15 patients (3.3%); 1 patient died without
breast cancer recurrence. Overall survival at 5 years was
96.4% among BRCA mutation carriers, as compared with
100% among non-carriers (hazard ratio for death 1.84,
95% CI 0.52–6.54; P = 0.35) (Fig. 2d). Survival analyses
comparing BRCA1 and BRCA2 separately showed that
BRCA1 mutation carriers appeared to have the worst
outcomes in the cohort, followed by BRCA2 mutation
carriers (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). The BRCA mutation
carriers had significantly poorer breast cancer specific
outcomes, most significantly in distant recurrence.
In the multivariate Cox proportional hazards model,
BRCA mutation remained an independent poor prognos-
tic factor for all cancer outcomes after adjustment for co-
variates including tumor size, lymph node status, triple
negative tumor type, age, and treatment modalities
(Table 3). The adjusted hazard ratios for BRCA mutation
carriers were 3.04 (95% CI 1.40–6.58; P = 0.005) for recur-
rence or death, 2.70 (95% CI 1.20–6.06; P = 0.016) for any
recurrence, 2.86 (95% CI 1.11–7.35; P = 0.029) for distant
recurrence, and 8.01 (95% CI 1.44–44.7; P = 0.018) for any
death. Among the clinical covariates, multivariate analysis
showed poorer prognosis in large tumors, and favorable
prognosis for those having had chemotherapy or with
triple negative tumor types (Additional file 2: Table S2).
To evaluate the prognostic consequences of the non-
BRCA gene mutations, we compared the clinical out-
comes between breast cancer patients with BRCA muta-
tion, with non-BRCA mutation, and without mutation
(Table 2B). The BRCA mutation carriers had a higher
rate of any recurrence (30.6% vs 13.4%; P = 0.005) or dis-
tant recurrence (25.0% vs 9.6%; P = 0.004) than those
with no mutation. In contrast, the non-BRCA mutation
group had no distant metastasis or death and only one
locoregional recurrence. No statistically significant dif-
ference in outcome was detected in this group as com-
pared with those with no mutation. PALB2 mutation
was the most prevalent in the non-BRCA mutation
group,
and
survival
analyses
comparing
PALB2
to
BRCA1, BRCA2 mutation carriers and to the remaining
patients showed that PALB2 mutation carriers had favor-
able prognosis (Additional file 1: Figure S1).
Significance of risk factors for breast cancer susceptibility
gene mutation
Correlations between the hereditary breast cancer risk
factors and having a detectable germline mutation in
any of the 20 genes were shown in Table 4. Multivariate
analysis showed that the only significant risk factor in
this high risk cohort was having bilateral breast cancer
(synchronous or metachronous), with an adjusted odds
ratio of 3.27 (95% CI 1.64–6.51; P = 0.0008). Family his-
tory, age of onset for breast cancer, and triple-negative
breast cancer did not show significant correlation with
the presence of mutation. The number of individuals

Having higher number of risk factors in an individual
was also significantly correlated with having a germline
mutation. For each additional risk factor, the odds ratio
of having a mutation was 1.82 (95% CI 1.25–2.64; P =
0.002). Having more than one risk factor was associated
with an odds ratio of 2.07 (95% CI 1.22–3.51; P = 0.007)
of detecting a mutation.
To focus on the impact of high penetrance breast cancer
susceptibility genes, we repeated the correlation analysis
for four high penetrance genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2,
TP53), and for the two most prominent breast cancer sus-
ceptibility genes (BRCA1, BRCA2) (Additional file 3: Table
S3). The results shown in Additional file 3: Table S3 did
not lead to conclusions disagreeing with those based on
the 20-gene analysis shown in Table 4, maintaining similar
statistical correlations of having germline mutations with
bilateral breast cancer and with more clinical risk factors.
Discussion
We showed that BRCA germline mutation carriers in
this large ethnic Chinese cohort were more likely to be
diagnosed with breast cancer already spread to regional
lymph nodes, and their breast cancer related outcomes
were significantly worse. The 5-year disease-free survival
rate was only 73.3% for BRCA mutation carriers, in con-
trast to 91.1% for non-mutation carriers. The BRCA mu-
tation status was an independent prognostic factor with
an adjusted hazard ratio of 3.04 (95% CI 1.40–6.58) for
cancer recurrence or death. The poor clinical outcome
in BRCA mutation carriers mainly resulted from recur-
rence as distant metastasis, therefore excluding the con-
tribution by new primary cancer in the ipsilateral or
contralateral breast, of which the risk had been known
to be elevated in BRCA mutation carriers. Our result im-
plied the more aggressive nature of breast tumors in
BRCA germline mutation carriers. Most previous studies
on clinical outcomes of BRCA mutation carriers have
failed to show a significant prognostic effect by BRCA
mutation [9–11, 13, 14]. However, a recent systematic
review showed that both BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation
carriers had significantly worse breast cancer specific
survival [15]. The discrepancy in these studies may in
part result from limitations due to small sample sizes,
lack of adjusting for disease characteristics, variations in
mutation assay techniques, mutation types, cancer treat-
ment modalities, or lengths of follow-up. Our study was
conducted in an all-Chinese cohort where all study par-
ticipants underwent the same NGS-based complete se-
quencing of the coding regions of BRCA genes among

other genes. The majority of the mutations were in the
BRCA2 gene. The follow-ups were extensive in terms of
length, with median duration over 5 years, and com-
pleteness. The tumor characteristics and outcome data
had been collected in a prospective manner in a breast
cancer registry as well as after the participants were en-
rolled. The majority of the breast cancer patients in the
cohort (94%) had undergone treatment in a single cancer
center
where
cancer
characteristic-based
treatment
guideline was consistently adhered to. The homogeneity
on data collection may have strengthened the validity of
the prognostic analysis.
Studies have shown that tumor cells with BRCA muta-
tions may show different response to different chemo-
therapy agents; they may have enhanced sensitivity to
platinum while more resistant to taxanes. However, clin-
ical studies on comparison of chemotherapy regimens in
the BRCA mutation populations are limited [12]. For the
breast cancer patients in our cohort, less than 10% re-
ceived cisplatin in the neoadjuvant setting and none in
the adjuvant setting, while about a third received a
taxane (docetaxel) in the adjuvant setting. There were
no significant differences in chemotherapy choice be-
tween the groups with and without BRCA mutation.
Despite a higher rate of BRCA mutation carriers re-
ceiving chemotherapy, they had poorer cancer out-
comes.
Further

studies
are
needed
to
determine the optimal chemotherapy for BRCA muta-
tion carriers. With the anticipated efficacy of incorp-
oration of PARP inhibitors in the treatment of BRCA
mutation

tumors,
knowledge
of
BRCA mutation status prior to initial cancer treat-
ment becomes even more crucial.
In this Chinese cohort of high risk individuals for heredi-
tary breast cancer, we found an overall prevalence of 13.5%
for carriers of germline mutations in 11 of the 20 breast
cancer susceptibility genes. In contrast to western popula-
tions, BRCA2 mutations (52.3%) were much more common
than BRCA1 mutations (9.2%) in our cohort, similar to
findings in other studies in the Asian population [34]. Non-
BRCA genes contributed to 38.5% of the mutation carriers,
with PALB2 (13.8%), RAD51D (9.2%), and ATM (4.6%) be-
ing the majority. PALB2 is particularly important since life-
time risk for breast cancer can reach 58% in those with
family history [51], and NCCN guideline recommends con-
sideration of risk-reducing mastectomy [52]. Among the 8
cases with RAD51C and RAD51D mutations, 6 (75%) were
triple negative breast cancer, in agreement with the recent
studies suggesting that mutations in these two genes may
confer higher risks of triple-negative or basal subtypes of
breast cancer [23, 24]. We also found 2 individuals with
protein-truncating mutations in TP53 and PMS2 genes,
which are high-penetrance cancer predisposing genes and
would result in significantly high risk for other cancers.
These results showed that testing more than BRCA1 and
BRCA2 increased the detection rate of clinically actionable
high and moderate risk gene mutations, therefore may be
an important strategy in the Chinese population. In a study
by Thompson et al., significant excess of mutations was
only observed for PALB2 and TP53 in familial breast cancer
cases compared to cancer-free controls [6]. We similarly
only found a small number of genes contributing to the
majority of mutation carriers. To overcome the challenge
of high rates of VUS and questionable clinical actionability,
we recommend limiting cancer susceptibility multigene
panel in clinical testing to include only a handful of genes
with high clinical impact.
Among the six risk factors for hereditary breast cancer
in this cohort of all high risk individuals, only bilateral
breast cancer showed a statistically significant odds ratio
of 3.27 for having a germline mutation in multivariate
analysis. In addition, having more risk factors was also
associated with a high detection rate of mutations (OR
2.07 for having more than one risk factor). These results
suggest that these known risk factors were helpful in
identifying individuals for genetic testing and we may
need to pay particular attention to those with bilateral
breast cancer, even in the absence of family history or
young age of onset. Larger cohorts are needed to clarify
the significance of ovarian cancer and male breast cancer
on breast cancer susceptibility gene mutations in the
Asian population. Results from the correlation analysis
done with the few high penetrance genes were similar to
those done with all the studied genes, suggesting that
the correlations were driven by these high penetrance
genes including BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, and TP53,
which was expected since they represented the majority
of the pathogenic variants.
There were some limitations in our study. First, we
did not conduct experiments to detect large genome re-
arrangement (LGR) in all study participants, but used
bioinformatics analytical tools to detect copy number
variations on the NGS data. This could underestimate
the prevalence of LGR in this cohort. However, LGRs
have not been shown to contribute significantly to germ-
line mutations in BRCA genes in East Asian populations
[53, 54]. Second, we were conservative in classifying var-
iants as pathogenic
and limited those
to
protein-
truncating variants, which were without ambiguity in as-
signment of pathogenicity. There were two missense var-
iants classified as likely pathogenic in the ClinVar
database, and many missense variants deemed damaging
by multiple in silico models. However, we did not assign
those as pathogenic mutations in this study. We could
therefore have underestimated the prevalence of patho-
genic mutations. Further studies are underway to evalu-
ate variant segregation with cancer in families, and the
accuracy of in silico models.

Conclusions
In this high risk ethnic Chinese cohort, 13.5% had a
germline pathogenic mutation in one of twenty breast
cancer susceptibility genes, and 8.3% had a BRCA1or
BRCA2 mutation. BRCA mutation carriers, when diag-
nosed with breast cancer, were more likely to have
lymph node involvement. Their breast cancer specific
outcomes were significantly worse even after adjusting
for clinical prognostic factors, suggesting BRCA muta-
tion to be an independent factor for poor prognosis. Our
results highlighted the importance of early testing for
breast cancer susceptibility genes, not only for preven-
tion and earlier diagnosis of breast cancer, but also for
optimal treatment and surveillance strategies after breast
cancer is diagnosed. Further studies are needed to evalu-
ate different treatment approaches for breast cancer in
BRCA mutation carriers to improve outcome.
