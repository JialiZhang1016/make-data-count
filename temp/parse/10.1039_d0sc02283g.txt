Sequential treatment of [Rh(COE)2Cl]2 (COE ¼ cyclooctene) with PiPr3, alkyne derivatives and tBuN^BMes
(Mes ¼ 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl) provided functionalized rhodium h4-1,2-azaborete complexes of the form
(h4-azaborete)RhCl(PiPr3). The scope of this reaction was expanded to encompass alkynes with
hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, ferrocenyl, alkynyl, azaborinyl and boronate ester substituents. Treatment of these
complexes with PMe3 led to insertion of the rhodium atom into the B–C bond of the BNC2 ring, forming
1-rhoda-3,2-azaboroles. Addition of N-heterocyclic carbenes to azaborete complexes led to highly
unusual rearrangements to rhodium h2,k1-allenylborylamino complexes via deprotonation and C–N
bond cleavage. Heating and photolysis of an azaborete complex also led to rupture of the C–N bond
followed by subsequent rearrangements, yielding an h4-aminoborylallene complex and two isomeric h4-
butadiene complexes.
Introduction
Complexes of the late transition metals have long been known
to catalyze the cyclotrimerization of alkynes to arenes (Scheme
1).1–7 Incorporation of nitriles under appropriate conditions can
also provide an eﬃcient route to substituted pyridines.8 Mech-
anistic studies on Rh-based catalyst systems indicate that two
coordinated alkyne molecules undergo reductive coupling to
produce a rhodacyclopentadiene intermediate, from which
a further alkyne/nitrile insertion step and subsequent reductive
elimination yields the arene.1,9,10 In 2012, our group exploited
the isolobal relationship between alkynes and iminoboranes to
prepare a 1,4-azaborinine by an analogous catalytic cyclization
of two equivalents of alkyne and one of the iminoborane
tBuN^BtBu.11
Shortly
aerwards
it
was
established
that
replacing acetylene with the bulkier ethynylferrocene aﬀords
a 1,2-azaborinine rather than the 1,4-isomer,12 while use of
tBuN^BMes as the iminoborane unit was also found to produce
1,2-azaborinines with a range of alkynes.13 These BN isosteres of
common aromatic compounds are of interest for biomedical
and materials applications.14,15 Employing bridged di- or tri-
alkynes also allowed the preparation of the respective bis- and
tris-azaborinine products.16 Both of these reaction types appear
to proceed via rhodium-bound h4-1,2-azaborete intermediates,
which can be isolated from stoichiometric reactions. The
divergent regioselectivity of the subsequent reactions with
a second equivalent of alkyne indicates that the azaborete can
undergo ring opening via cleavage of either the B–N bond
(leading to 1,4-azaborinines) or the B–C bond (leading to the
1,2-isomer).
It should be emphasized that the intermediacy of azaboretes
in these reactions stands in sharp contrast to the reactions of
all-carbon analogues in this regard – whereas ve-membered
metallacyclopentadiene derivatives17 are believed to be key
reaction intermediates in the trimerization of alkynes, the cor-
responding h4-cyclobutadiene complexes18,19 resulting from
reductive elimination are highly stable and thought to be

catalyst deactivation products rather than intermediates.9,20 In
this work, we report the synthesis of a range of new rhodium
1,2-azaborete complexes by alkyne/iminoborane coupling and
explore their reactivity towards neutral Lewis bases. Our results
reveal that both the B–C and N–C bonds of the azaborete can be
ruptured, depending on the donor species employed.
Results and discussion
The rhodium h4-azaborete complexes 1a–l were prepared
according to a procedure adapted from a previously published
route (Scheme 2).12 The complex [Rh(COE)2Cl]2 (COE ¼ cyclo-
octene) was subsequently treated with PiPr3, an alkyne deriva-
tive and
tBuN^BMes in a one-pot synthesis, giving the
complexes as yellow/orange solids aer workup. The 11B NMR
chemical shis fall within a narrow range (20.3–24.8 ppm),
indicating that the inuence of the alkyne substituents on the
ring electronics is relatively small. The 31P NMR signals appear
between 48 and 61 ppm, with characteristic 1JRh-P coupling
constants of around 195 Hz. A wide variety of alkyne substitu-
ents can be employed, including electron-donating (Me, Et, 4-
Me2NC6H4)
and
electron-withdrawing
groups
(4-F3CC6H4,
Bpin), as well as one example with an azaborininyl substituent,
prepared by the aforementioned rhodium-mediated protocol.
The diyne 1,4-diethynylbenzene could also be employed to
aﬀord bis(h4-1,2-azaborete) complex 1l. Despite the multiple
reaction steps, the yields of complexes 1 were generally high
(60–89%), with the exception of 1l (31%), where impurities with
similar solubility hampered the workup. The crystallographi-
cally determined bond lengths of the azaborete ring in
compounds 1a–l are remarkably similar across the series (see
ESI†).
Reactions with phosphines
The computationally predicted mechanism for the formation of
1,4-di-tert-butyl-2-phenyl-1,4-azaborinine from its respective
[RhCl(h4-azaborete)(PiPr3)] complex and acetylene involves
formation of a p-complex between the incoming acetylene
molecule and rhodium.16 Acetylene inserts into the azaborete
ring by attacking the boron atom, causing subsequent cleavage
of the B–N bond, whereas in the case of 1,2-azaborinines the
B–C bond is broken. We hoped to gain evidence for interme-
diate species in these reactions by treating azaborete complexes
with Lewis bases that are less susceptible to engaging in further
reactivity, such as trialkylphosphines and N-heterocyclic car-
benes. Reaction of compound 1a with 2.2 equivalents of PMe3 at
room temperature in benzene solution led to a new compound
with a doublet signal in the 31P NMR spectrum at 4.7 ppm
(1JRh-P ¼ 130 Hz) alongside free PiPr3. Conversion was complete
within one hour. The sole peak at 67.8 ppm in the 11B NMR
spectrum indicated a dramatic change in the boron environ-
ment. Removal of volatiles and trituration with hexane gave 1-
rhoda-3,2-azaborole complex 2a in 70% yield (Scheme 3).
Crystals grown from hexane allowed the unambiguous identi-
cation of the compound by X-ray diﬀraction (Fig. 1). The
geometry at rhodium can be described as a distorted square-
based pyramid, with the phosphines located trans to one
another and capped by the boryl ligand. The 1-rhoda-3,2-
azaborole ring is slightly distorted from planarity, while the
C1–C2 (1.335(2) ˚A) and B–N (1.426(2) ˚A) bond lengths are in the
range of double bonds. The Rh–B distance (2.025(2) ˚A) falls in
the
middle
of
the
range

rhodium
boryl
complexes.21,22 The only similar structure in the literature is that
of an osmium aminoboryl complex bearing a ve-membered
osmacycle unit,23 which was prepared by reaction of an
osmium tetrahydroborate complex with two equivalents of
aniline. The carbon atoms in the ring form part of a C–H acti-
vated aryl group, and as such, the bonding situation is not
directly comparable to that in 2a.

Compounds 1b and 1c both reacted with PMe3 in an iden-
tical fashion within 1 h to yield the corresponding 1-rhoda-3,2-
azaborole complexes in good yields. Complexes 1d–f, bearing
hydrocarbon substituents at both carbon atoms of the azabor-
ete ring, required longer reaction times (up to 4 h), but none-
theless produced good yields (79–87%) of the corresponding 1-
rhoda-3,2-azaborole complexes 2d–f. Boryl-substituted complex
1g could also be converted to its corresponding rhoda-3,2-
azaborole,
2g,
although
in
this
case,
the
reaction
was
hampered by low reactivity and formation of side-products,
necessitating a reaction time of four days and the use of
a larger excess of PMe3 (4.4 eq.) and limiting the yield to 35%.
Azaborinine derivative 1k did not react with PMe3 at room
temperature, whereas heating led to an unselective reaction,
with only traces of the intended product observed in the NMR
spectra. Bis(azaborete) complex 1l was converted cleanly to
rhoda-3,2-azaborole 2l (Fig. 1) aer 15 h at room temperature,
with a reasonable isolated yield of 60%. Notably, complexes 2a–
g and 2l remain 16-valence-electron (VE) Rh(III) species, and do
not bind the excess phosphine present in the reaction mixture.
A
series
of
related,
carbon-based
rhodacyclopentadiene
complexes reported by Marder and co-workers retain three
PMe3 ligands and one chloride ligand, making them 18 VE
species.24 While this observation could be related to the steric
pressure caused by the boron-bound mesityl group, the strong
trans inuence of boryl groups25,26 is also expected to disfavour
coordination of a further PMe3 ligand.
Given the somewhat unexpected formation of 2a, we
undertook DFT calculations to investigate the mechanism of
this reaction. We used a free energy map of proposed inter-
mediates to identify the most feasible pathway for the ring
opening process. These results (see ESI† for details) clearly show
that association of a further phosphine ligand must occur prior
to insertion of the Rh atom into the B–C bond of the azaborete.
The thermodynamically most plausible mechanism involves
endergonic coordination of PMe3 to 1a (DG ¼ 7.8 kcal mol1),
followed by dissociative substitution of the remaining PiPr3
ligand by PMe3. The intermediate [RhCl(h4-azaborete)(PMe3)2]
(0.4 kcal mol1 less stable than 1a), all-carbon cyclobutadiene
derivatives of which can be isolated with chelating diphos-
phines,19 undergoes ring-slippage to the 16-VE species [RhCl(h2-
azaborete)(PMe3)2], with the azaborete now coordinated via the
B–C bond and mutually trans phosphine ligands. This species is
then set up to undergo oxidative ring opening to form 2a
(9.1 kcal mol1 more stable than 1a). A transition state was
identied for the B–C bond cleavage step, indicating that this
process has a remarkably low barrier (2.3 kcal mol1). Direct
ring opening of the starting complex would produce a hypo-
thetical four-coordinate, 14-VE [RhCl(k2-BNCC)(PiPr3)] inter-
mediate that is 20.4 kcal mol1 higher in energy than 1a, and
thus unlikely to be accessible under the mild conditions
employed in the reaction.
We subsequently performed a number of NMR-scale test
reactions with diﬀerent phosphines, which can be summarised

as follows: PEt3 reacts with 1a similarly to PMe3, producing
rhoda-2,3-azaborole complex [RhCl(k2-BNCC)(PEt3)2] (2a(PEt3));
PiPr3 leaves compound 1a unchanged (although a dynamic
process of ligand exchange may occur); PCy3 results in partial
substitution of PiPr3 upon heating to 80 C, with formation of
[RhCl(h4-azaborete)(PCy3)] (1a(PCy3)) in an equilibrium that can
be driven to the product side by repeated removal of PiPr3 under
vacuum, but no ring opening was observed. We therefore
propose that associative phosphine exchange at Rh in 1a is
facile, but that bulkier phosphines favour reversion to low-
coordinate complexes of the form 1a. Small phosphines sta-
bilise intermediates [RhCl(h4-azaborete)(PR3)2], which can then
undergo ring slippage and irreversible ring opening to form
complexes 2a.
It is notable here that the calculated mechanism for the
formation of 1,4-di-tert-butyl-2-phenyl-1,4-azaborinine by reac-
tion of acetylene with [RhCl(h4-1,2-di-tert-butyl-4-phenyl-1,2-
azaborete)(PiPr3)] does not proceed via a rhoda-3,2-azaborole
intermediate.16 Although the initial step of coordination of the
incoming Lewis base (alkyne or phosphine) is the same, the
barrier to insertion of the alkyne into the B–Rh bond, which was
calculated to be only 5 kcal mol1, appears to be lower than that
of oxidative addition of the B–C bond to the metal in this case.
Nonetheless, it is quite plausible that azaborole complexes of
the form 2 are intermediates in the formation of 1,2-azabor-
inines from 1-tert-butyl-2-mesityl-1,2-azaboretes, and we are
continuing to investigate this computationally.
Reactions with N-heterocyclic carbenes
We subsequently investigated the reactivity of the azaborete
complexes towards N-heterocyclic carbenes. Addition of three
equivalents of the small NHC IMe (1,3-dimethylimidazol-2-
ylidene) to a benzene solution of 1a led to formation of a col-
ourless precipitate within 20 minutes at room temperature,
which was ltered oﬀand identied as 1,3-dimethylimidazo-
lium chloride by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The 11B NMR spectrum
of the ltrate revealed a major signal at 33.6 ppm. The
predominant signal in the 31P NMR spectrum was a doublet at
48.8 ppm with a
1JRh-P coupling constant of 140 Hz, with
a number of minor by-products including free PiPr3 also
present. Aer stirring for 15 h and subsequent work-up, the
major species could be isolated as a yellow solid, which was
identied by X-ray diﬀraction as complex 3aMe (Scheme 4,
Fig. 2), in 40% yield. Here, the N–C bond of the azaborete ligand
had been cleaved, while the CH3 ring substituent had been
deprotonated, forming an allene. Coordination of the h2,k1-
allenylborylamino fragment to rhodium occurs through the
nitrogen atom and the internal carbon–carbon p bond.
Although the B–N distance of 1.397(5) ˚A is rmly in the range of
a double bond, the long B–Rh distance of 2.525(4) ˚A rules out
any bonding interaction between these atoms. The C1–C2
distance of 1.382(5) ˚A is that of an elongated double bond,
consistent with signicant backbonding from the electron-rich
Rh(I) centre. The C2–C3 distance is comparatively short, at
1.304(4) ˚A, whereas the C1–C2–C3 angle of 150.8(3) indicates
considerable deviation from linearity, the distal CH2 group
being tilted away from the Rh centre. These observations
correlate well with allene complexes in the literature with
moderately electron-rich metal fragments.27
Reaction of the bulkier NHC IiPr (1,3-diisopropylimidazol-2-
ylidene) with 1a initially led to similar results to the IMe case,
with observation of imidazolium chloride formation and
similar NMR signals (d(11B) ¼ 33 ppm, d(31P) ¼ 46.8 ppm, 1JRh-P

¼ 138 Hz) aer 20 minutes. However, here we observed larger
quantities of PiPr3 in the 31P NMR spectrum, while a small
amount of 1a also remained unreacted. Increasing the amount
of IiPr to 3.3 molar equivalents gave gradual conversion over 6
days at room temperature to the doubly NHC-substituted
complex 4aiPr, whose structure was unambiguously identied
by X-ray diﬀraction (Fig. 2). The bond lengths and angles of the
BNC2 ligand are not signicantly diﬀerent to those in 3aMe. The
(PiPr3)(IiPr) complex 3aiPr is evidently formed as an intermediate
before substitution of the PiPr3 ligand by a third equivalent of
NHC. Whereas 4aiPr could be isolated as a pure compound,
attempts to isolate 3aiPr were hampered by contamination with
4aiPr. A single crystal X-ray diﬀraction experiment nonetheless
conrmed the identity of 3aiPr, with the structural parameters of
the allenylborylamino ligand not signicantly altered from
those in 3aMe. This reactivity stands in contrast to the reaction
with IMe, where use of excess NHC increased the amount of free
phosphine observed, but signicant conversion to the putative
bis(NHC) complex 4aMe could not be achieved. We tentatively
ascribe the preferential formation of the bulkier complex 4aiPr
to stabilizing dispersion interactions between the ligands.
A terminal methyl group is not necessary for the conversion
of the azaborete ligand to an allene. Reaction of 3,4-diethyl-1,2-
azaborete complex 1e with IMe and IiPr led to the h2,k1-alle-
nylborylamino complexes 3eMe and 3eiPr/4eiPr, respectively, in
an almost identical fashion to 1a. Complex 3eMe is formed
rapidly at room temperature, while 3eiPr requires 4 h for
completion, presumably due to steric hindrance. As with the
conversion of 3aiPr to 4aiPr, a longer reaction time (4 days) was
necessary to achieve complete conversion to the bis(NHC)
complex 4eiPr, which was isolated and fully characterized.
Rhodium-mediated conversions of alkylacetylenes to allenes
are known, proceeding via a b-hydride shito the metal
centre.28,29 In light of the fact that the reactions with phosphines
do not cause a H-shi, and that a diﬀerent bond of the aza-
borete is broken, we propose that the more basic NHC is able to
directly deprotonate the pendent alkyl group. Whereas 1a only
has one b-hydrogen site for deprotonation, the regioselectivity
of the reaction of 1e to compounds 3e can be explained by the
increased acidity of these protons due to a resonance structure
(Scheme 5) bearing a negative charge at nitrogen (as opposed to
at boron). Treatment of compound 1b, which does not possess
any b-hydrogen atoms, with one equivalent of IMe does not lead
to ring opening. Instead, clean phosphine substitution gives the
complex [(h4-azaborete)RhCl(IMe)] (1b(IMe), characterised in
solution by NMR) alongside free PiPr3, suggesting that the NHC
does not directly cause cleavage of one of the ring bonds via
coordination to Rh as an initial step.
Heating compound 1e to 80 C in the absence of any further
Lewis base resulted in slow and somewhat unselective conver-
sion over four days to three main species as judged by 11B and
31P NMR spectroscopy. Removal of volatiles and trituration of
the residue with hexane produced a pale yellow solid with
signals at 29.3 ppm in its 11B NMR spectrum and 53.9 ppm (1JRh-
P ¼ 181 Hz) in its 31P NMR spectrum. Crystals suitable for X-ray
diﬀraction were obtained and conrmed the structure as that of
complex 5 (Scheme 6, Fig. 3). In the absence of an external HCl
acceptor, the amino nitrogen from the ring obtains a proton
from the CH2 unit of the adjacent ethyl group. In contrast to the
h2,k1-allenylborylamino ligands in complexes 3 and 4, the
protonated amide results in the neutral aminoborylallene
ligand adopting an h4 coordination mode. Schmid and co-
workers prepared the only reported compounds of this type of
acyclic h4-C]C–B]N ligand, as iron carbonyl complexes,30 but
5 is to the best of our knowledge the rst crystallographically
characterized example. The bonding parameters around the
B]N moiety are markedly diﬀerent to those in 4aiPr. Most
notably, the Rh–B distance is reduced from 2.516(2) ˚A to
2.342(3) ˚A, indicating a bonding interaction between these
atoms in 5. The lengthening of the Rh–N distance from 2.092(1)
˚A to 2.260(2) ˚A and of the B–N bond from 1.393(2) ˚A to 1.451(4) ˚A
are also consistent with the switch from an amido ligand to
a side-on coordinated aminoborane.
Concentration of the ltrate from this reaction produced X-
ray quality crystals of one of the other products (Scheme 5,
Fig. 3). Compound 6 (d(11B) ¼ 40 ppm, d(31P) ¼ 51.2 ppm, 1JRh-P
¼ 187 Hz) is a further isomer of 1e, in which the aminoborane
moiety is completely dissociated from the rhodium centre,
while the carbon chain has isomerized into a 2,4-hexadiene
ligand coordinated in an h4 fashion to Rh. It appears to be the
product of a formal 1,3-hydrogen shifrom the remaining ethyl
arm of compound 5 to the central allene carbon atom, followed

by a shiin coordination mode. Bosch and Werner reported the
related compound [Rh(C4H6)(PiPr3)Br], although no crystallo-
graphic data was available for comparison.31
Hoping to prove the intermediacy of 5 in the formation of 6,
we further heated 5 to 80 C in C6D6 solution overnight, but
observed little change in the NMR spectra. However, UV-
irradiation with a mercury–xenon-vapour lamp for 2 h led to
complete conversion to the third species from the original
thermolysis of 1e, with an 11B NMR signal at 39.9 ppm and
a doublet at 47.6 ppm (1JRh-P ¼ 169 Hz) in the 31P NMR spec-
trum, alongside traces of side products. Although the similar
solubility of the main product and side products prevented
isolation of the pure compound, slow evaporation of a pentane
solution produced X-ray quality crystals of a species matching
the main signals of the crude NMR spectra. Like 6, compound 7
(Scheme 6, Fig. 3) is an h4-butadiene complex isomeric to 1e,
but in this case the rearrangement leads to a 3-aminoboryl-1,3-
hexadiene ligand. This transformation likely involves at least
two hydrogen atom shis from the former ethyl group in 5,
although a shiof the aminoboryl group cannot be ruled out.
This reaction again demonstrates the preference of rhodium to
bond C]C rather than B]N units.
Conclusions
In summary, we have described several diverse ring-opening
reactions of rhodium h4-1,2-azaborete complexes, both by
treatment with neutral Lewis bases and through forcing
thermal or photolytic conditions. In combination with the
previously
observed
transformation
of
1,2-di-tert-butyl-1,2-
azaborete complexes to 1,4-azaborinines via B–N cleavage in
reactions with acetylene, these results show that three of the
four bonds of azaborete rings can be broken by addition of the
appropriate reagent. We are currently focussed on obtaining the
BN-containing ligands described here as metal-free species.
