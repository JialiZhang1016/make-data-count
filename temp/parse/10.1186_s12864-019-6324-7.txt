Abstract
Background: As a photoperiod-sensitive and self-pollinated species, the growth periods traits play important roles
in the adaptability and yield of soybean. To examine the genetic architecture of soybean growth periods, we
performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a panel of 278 soybean accessions and 34,710 single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with minor allele frequencies (MAF) higher than 0.04 detected by the specific-
locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) with a 6.14-fold average sequencing depth. GWAS was conducted
by a compressed mixed linear model (CMLM) involving in both relative kinship and population structure.
Results: GWAS revealed that 37 significant SNP peaks associated with soybean flowering time or other growth periods
related traits including full bloom, beginning pod, full pod, beginning seed, and full seed in two or more environments at
-log10(P) > 3.75 or -log10(P) > 4.44 were distributed on 14 chromosomes, including chromosome 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13,
14, 15, 17, 18, 19. Fourteen SNPs were novel loci and 23 SNPs were located within known QTLs or 75 kb near the known
SNPs. Five candidate genes (Glyma.05G101800, Glyma.11G140100, Glyma.11G142900, Glyma.19G099700, Glyma.19G100900)
in a 90 kb genomic region of each side of four significant SNPs (Gm5_27111367, Gm11_10629613, Gm11_10950924,
Gm19_34768458) based on the average LD decay were homologs of Arabidopsis flowering time genes of AT5G48385.1,
AT3G46510.1, AT5G59780.3, AT1G28050.1, and AT3G26790.1. These genes encoding FRI (FRIGIDA), PUB13 (plant U-box 13),
MYB59, CONSTANS, and FUS3 proteins respectively might play important roles in controlling soybean growth periods.
Conclusions: This study identified putative SNP markers associated with soybean growth period traits, which could be
used for the marker-assisted selection of soybean growth period traits. Furthermore, the possible candidate genes
involved in the control of soybean flowering time were predicted.

Background
Soybean (Glycine max) is a major crop of agronomic im-
portance grown across a wide range of latitudes from
50°N to 35°S [1]. However, soybean varieties are limited to
narrow latitudes due to the photoperiod sensitivity. The
complex growth period traits are controlled by both in-
ternal and external factors, which make great effects on
crop adaptability, biomass and economic yield [2]. As a
typical photoperiod-sensitive short-day plant, soybean
photoperiod is the main climatic factor that determines its
growth periods and adaptability to different ecological
zones. The genetic mechanisms of soybean flowering time
and maturity were complex [3]. Previous studies identified
at least 11 major-effect loci affecting flowering and matur-
ity of soybean, which were designated as E1 to E10 [4–14],
and the J locus for “long juvenile period” [15], which was
important for soybean to adapt to high latitude environ-
ments. E1, E2, E3, E4, E9 and J had been cloned or identi-
fied. Of these, E1 encoding a nuclear-localized B3
domain-containing protein was induced by long days. E2

encoded a homolog of GIGANTEA and controlled soy-
bean flowering time by regulating GmFT2a [1]. E3 and E4
encoded phytochrome PHYA3 and PHYA2 proteins [7,
16]. J was the dominant functional allele of GmELF3 [17].
In addition to these major loci, many minor-effect quanti-
tative traits loci (QTLs) related to soybean flowering time
and maturity had also been identified. To date, at least
104, 6, 5, and 5 QTLs associated with first flower, pod be-
ginning, seed beginning, and seed fill had been reported in
soybean (SoyBase, www.soobbase.org), respectively. Many
other orthologs of Arabidopsis flowering genes such as
GmCOLs [18], GmSOC1 [19], and GmCRY [20] had also
been identified. Taken together, these results showed a
complex genetic basis of flowering and maturity in
soybean.
Genome-wide association study (GWAS), based on
linkage disequilibrium (LD), had emerged as a powerful
tool for gene mapping in plants to take advantage of
phenotypic variation and historical recombination in
natural populations and overcome the limitations of bi-
parental populations, resulting in higher QTL mapping
resolution [21–23]. So far, the next-generation sequen-
cing technologies such as genotyping by sequencing
(GBS),
restriction
site-associated
DNA
sequencing
(RAD-seq) and specific-locus amplified fragment se-
quencing (SLAF-seq) had been used to detect high-
quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for
GWAS in soybean [24–26]. The Illumina Infinium
SoySNP50K BeadChip was used to genotype the popula-
tion consisting of 309 early-maturing soybean germ-
plasm resources, and ten candidate genes homologous
to Arabidopsis flowering genes were identified near the
peak SNPs associated with flowering time detected via
GWAS [3]. Ninety-one soybean cultivars of maturity
groups (MGs) 000-VIII were subjected to GWAS using
Illumina SoySNP6K iSelectBeadChip, and 87 SNP loci
associated with soybean flowering were identified [27].
Eight hundred and nine soybean cultivars were se-
quenced on Illumina HiSeq 2000 and 2500 sequencer,
GWAS identified 245 significant genetic loci associated
with 84 agronomic traits by single and multiple marker
frequentist test (EMMAX), 95 of which interacted with
other loci [28]. The recombinant inbred line (RIL) popu-
lation were genotyped by RAD-seq in 2 year studies, the
high-density soybean genetic map was constructed and
60 QTLs that influenced six yield-related and two qual-
ity traits were identified [29]. SLAF-seq technology had
several obvious advantages, such as high throughput,
high accuracy, low cost and short cycle, and this tech-
nology had been reported in haplotype mapping, genetic
mapping, linkage mapping and polymorphism mapping.
It could also provide important bases for molecular
breeding, system evolution and germplasm resource
identification. A total of 200 diverse soybean accessions
with different resistance to SCN HG Type 2.5.7 were ge-
notyped by SLAF-seq for GWAS, and the results re-
vealed 13 SNPs associated with resistance to SCN HG
Type 2.5.7, and 30 candidate genes underlying SCN re-
sistance were identified [30]. In the present study, we
performed GWAS for soybean growth period traits in
the total of 278 soybean accessions genotyped by SLAF-
seq and identified 37 significantly associated SNPs in
two or more environments and five potential candidate
genes regulating growth periods. Our studies provided
an insight into the genetic architecture of soybean
growth periods and the identified candidate markers and
genes would be valuable for the marker-assisted selec-
tion of soybean.
Results
Phenotype statistics of 278 soybean germplasms
Field experiments were conducted in three different lo-
cations (Harbin, Changchun, Shenyang) in China for
2 years (2015 and 2016). The statistical analysis on the
results of phenotype indicated that six growth period
characteristics including flowering time, full bloom, be-
ginning pod, full pod, beginning seed, and full seed of
278 soybean germplasms (Fig. 1, Additional file 1)
showed abundant phenotypic variation (14.9~43.6%)
(Additional file 2), and reflected their great potential of
genetic improvement. After normalizing, the six growth
period characters of 278 soybean germplasms above
showed normal distributions without any significant
skewness, which could be used for the subsequent statis-
tical analysis (Additional file 10: Figure S1). Correlation
analysis showed that there were high correlations be-
tween flowering time and full bloom (0.90~0.98), begin-
ning pod (0.96~0.88), full pod (0.87~0.94), beginning
seed
(0.84~0.93),
and
full
seed
(0.83~0.90)
(Add-
itional file 11: Figure S2), implying that the flowering
time and the other five growth periods in soybean might
be controlled by the same genetic factors.
The results of ANOVA showed that the heritability of
flowering time, full bloom, beginning pod, full pod, be-
ginning seed, and full seed in soybean were quite high
(94.7~96.2%) (Additional file 3), indicating that the
growth periods traits were mainly significantly affected
by genetic variability. Therefore, the probability of
obtaining the off springs with excellent target traits was
large by selecting them in the early generation of breed-
ing using a strict criteria [32]. However, the flowering
time, full bloom, beginning pod, full pod, beginning
seed, and full seed in soybean were also affected by en-
vironmental factors such as geographical location and
year, as well as environment-genotype interactions (P <
0.01) (Additional file 3), which made the majority of soy-
bean bloom the earliest in Shenyang (lower latitude),
whereas bloom the latest in Harbin (higher latitude) in

the same year (Additional file 1, Additional file 2). Forty-
one soybean germplasms flowering earlier (27.5~38.5 d)
and 53 flowering later (58~113 d) with stable perform-
ance (Additional file 4) were screened by GGE biplot in
six environments to avoid the impact of the environ-
ment, which could be considered for broadening the
genetic basis for the improvement of soybean germ-
plasms to produce greater super-parent effects.
Linkage disequilibrium (LD), population structure and
kinship analyses
The DNA sequencing data had been uploaded [33].
The dataset of 34,710 SNPs with MAF higher than
0.04 covering all 20 chromosomes was used to con-
duct GWAS (Additional file 5, Additional file 12: Fig-
ure S3). The largest number of SNPs was identified on
chromosome 18 (2708 SNPs) followed by chromosome
15 (2515 SNPs), and the smallest of SNPs was found
on chromosomes 11 (961 SNPs) and chromosomes 12
(1079 SNPs) (Additional file 6, Fig. 2). The highest
marker density was detected on chromosome 15 (one
SNP per 20.58 kb), and the smallest one was identified
on chromosome 12 (one SNP per 37.15 kb), while the
average marker density was approximately one SNP
per 28.36 kb (Additional file 6). It was found that the
average LD decay distance of the population was about
300 kb (r2 = 0.5) by 34,710 SNP markers for LD ana-
lysis (Fig. 3a). Previous studies had shown that the LD
decay distance of soybean natural population was
250~375 kb [34], which was similar to the results of
this study, indicating that the marker coverage ob-
tained in this study was high enough for GWAS. The
population structure of 278 soybean accessions ob-
tained by principal component analysis of 34,710 SNPs
reflected the subgroup structure (Fig. 3b and c), sug-
gesting that geographic isolation was important for

shaping genetic differentiation of soybean. The kinship
matrix among 278 soybean accessions calculated based
on 34,710 SNPs indicated a lower level of genetic re-
latedness among soybean individuals (Fig. 3d).
Identification of genetic loci and candidate genes
through GWAS
The CMLM-PCA + K statistical model considering the co-
variates composed of population structure and kinship
matrix was used for GWAS to prevent false positivity [35].
The total of 223 SNP loci associated with flowering time,
full bloom, beginning pod, full pod, beginning seed, and full
seed in one or more environments were all considered to
be candidate sites for flowering time in soybean, because
the correlation analysis above demonstrated that these six
growth period traits may be controlled by the same genetic
factors (Fig. 4, Additional file 7, Additional file 8). Among
them, 186 SNPs detected in one environment may be sus-
ceptible to environmental influences, 37 SNPs that could
explain 17.41~21.95% phenotypic variation in two or more
environments could be stably inherited in different environ-
ments, and it was considered that there would be key genes
controlling flowering time nearby.
Twenty-three of 37 SNPs were located within the known
QTLs or located 75 kb near the known SNPs controlling
soybean growth periods, indicating the feasibility of the nat-
ural population for GWAS (Additional file 8). In addition,

yang, 2016 Shenyang, respectively (Fig. 6). The other
growth periods also showed the similar tendency with the

could be targets for breeders for marker assisted selection
of soybean growth periods traits.
Discussion
Six soybean growth periods were significantly affected by
genetic-environment interaction
Soybean is a short-day plant with induced cumulative ef-
fects by short days, and the flowering time of soybeans
and other growth periods were quantitative traits con-
trolled by multiple genes. The six growth periods (flow-
ering
time,
full
bloom,
beginning
pod,
full
pod,
beginning seed, and full seed) of 278 soybean germplasm
resources in this study were highly variable (14.9~43.6%)
in different environments, indicating that the natural
population could be used for the genetic improvement
of growth periods. The high heritability (94.7~96.2%) of
six growth periods indicated that they were mainly af-
fected by genetic factors. In addition, soybean growth
periods were significantly or extremely significantly af-
fected
by
environmental
and
genotype-environment
interaction, indicating that in addition to genetic effects,
photoperiod and temperature conditions in different
planting environments played crucial roles in determin-
ing the growth periods, which directly determined
whether soybeans grown in different ecological environ-
ments could flower and mature normally. The growth
periods of soybean determined the latitude range suit-
able for planting, so it was of great significance to study
the characteristics of soybean growth periods. In this
study, the genetic relationship among 94 stable soybean
germplasms, including 41 earlier and 53 later flowering
soybean varieties screened by GGE was far from each
other, which could be qualified as hybrid breeding par-
ent [36].
The LD decay rate of soybean was higher than cross-
pollinated species due to genetic bottleneck
Increased LD was a hallmark of genetic bottlenecks, the
greater LD decay rate for self-pollination was expected to
be higher than that of cross-pollinated species [37]. As the
physical distance increases, the LD decay of the entire
genome was estimated to be decayed to r2 = 0.5 within ap-
proximately 300 kb, consistent with previous studies in
soybean (250~375 kb) [34], similar to the other self-
pollinated species such as rice (123~167 kb) and sorghum
(150 kb) [38, 39], but much larger than the cross-
pollinated species such as maize (1~10 kb) [40]. The lower
density of SNPs was suitable for GWAS in soybean as

compared with other crops like rice, sorghum and maize,
therefore, LD decay rate was the primary factor limiting
the mapping resolution in GWAS for soybean.
Determination of 23 known and 14 new soybean
flowering time loci
To date, a number of QTLs associated with soybean
growth periods had been reported. In the present study, a
total of 37 SNPs distributed on ten chromosomes
(chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 12, 14, 15, 17 and 19) were as-
sociated with soybean flowering time or the other growth
periods in two or more environments. Among the 37 en-
vironmental stable association signals, 23 SNPs were over-
lapped with known QTL or located 75 kb near the known
SNPs controlling soybean growth periods. For instance,
two SNPs, Gm2_12243099 and Gm3_5483526, were iden-
tified at 73.01 and 18.97 kb near Gm2_12316110 [28] and
Gm03_5502496 [27], respectively. All the four SNPs,

Gm11_10774464, Gm11_10774489, Gm11_10793174, and
Gm11_10851924 were identified near Gm11_10847172
[28]. In addition, 14 new SNPs were identified to be sig-
nificantly different from the major QTLs or reported SNPs
and the molecular mechanisms of these new loci needed
to be further studied.
Five candidate genes were identified in different
flowering pathways
The regulation of flowering time is a very complicated
process that is influenced by both genetic factors and
external environmental factors. The precise control of
flowering time is achieved by the combination of

various signals generated by these two aspects [41]. To
date, approximately six genetic pathways for the pro-
motion or repression of flowering time have been
identified
in
Arabidopsis,
including
photoperiod,
temperature, vernalization, gibberellin (GA) biosyn-
thesis, autonomous and aging pathways [42]. In photo-

peak SNP and LD block of four significant SNPs (Gm5_
27111367, Gm11_10629613, Gm11_10950924, Gm19_
34768458). The Arabidopsis transcription factor CON-
STANS (CO) played a central role in promoting flower-
ing in LDs. CO protein directly binded to the motifs in
the proximal promoter of its major target gene FLOW-
ERING LOCUS T (FT) to promote flowering [43, 44].
After transcriptional activation by CO, FT protein
moved to the shoot apex, where it induced transcrip-
tional reprogramming of the meristem to form an in-
florescence meristem and subsequently flowered [45].
Thus, Glyma.19G099700, located at 85.90 kb downstream
of Gm19_34768458, and encoding a ZINC FINGER PRO-
TEIN CONSTANS-LIKE 14-RELATED transcription factor
might be involved in soybean photoperiod control of flow-
ering pathway. In vernalization pathway, FRI (FRIGIDA)
was located upstream of FLC (FLOWERING LOCUS C)
and regulated vernalization by regulating FLC [42]. The
two helix-helical domains of FRI protein interacted with
the nucleus cap-binding complex (CBC) to increase tran-
scription and efficient splicing of the flowering inhibitor
FLC and delayed flowering [46]. Then, a FRIGIDA-like
protein encoded by Glyma.05G101800 was located at
47.91 kb upstream of Gm5_27111367, but there was no
vernalization in soybean, and the function of soybean FRI
needed to be validated whether it was related to flowering
time. PUB13 was a negative regulator of flowering time
under middle- and long-day conditions in which the
expression of SOC1 (SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRES-
SION OF CONSTANS1) and FT was induced while FLC
expression was suppressed in Arabidopsis [47]. Gly-
ma.11G140100 located at 47.56 kb upstream of Gm11_
10629613 might be considered to be associated with soy-
bean flowering. MYB59 was induced during the light-to-
dark transition [48] and was regulated by the circadian
cycle with peak expression in the evening, probably due to
its regulation by CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1
(CCA1) which was expressed in the morning [49]. CCA1
acted as a transcriptional repressor by associating to the
ELF4 promoter [50] and the ELF3 promoter [51] of the
photoperiodic flowering pathway. Therefore, the tran-
scription factor MYB59-related Glyma.11G142900 located
at 35.11 kb upstream of Gm11_10950924 might be consid-
ered to be associated with soybean flowering. Gly-
ma.19G100900 located at 37.60 kb downstream of Gm19_
34768458 was a B3 domain-containing transcription fac-
tor FUS3, which was also identified as a candidate gene of
soybean flowering time. Arabidopsis plants overexpressing
FUS3 post-embryonically in the L1 layer (ML1p:FUS3)
showed late flowering and other developmental pheno-
types [52].
Conclusions
GWAS was powerful in dissecting complex traits and
identifying candidate genes. Fourteen novel SNPs and 23
SNPs that located within known QTLs or 75 kb near the
known SNPs associated with soybean flowering time or
other related growth period traits in this study may have
great potential for soybean yield improvement. Five can-
didate genes related to soybean flowering time might
serve as promising targets for studies of molecular
mechanisms underlying growth period traits in soybean.
Methods
Plant materials and phenotypic evaluation
The soybean growth period traits including flowering
time, full bloom, beginning pod, full pod, beginning
seed, and full seed of the natural population consisting
of 278 diverse soybean accessions with varied maturity
and growth habit characteristics were recorded and used
for GWAS. Two hundred sixty-four and fourteen soy-
bean germplasms [53] were from China and other coun-
tries (20°13′N~ 61.5°N) (Fig. 1, Additional file 1). The
map was completed by ‘ggplots’, ‘colorspace’, ‘ggmap’,
‘sp’, ‘maptools’, ‘maps’, and ‘labeling’ packages in R soft-
ware [54, 55]. All the soybean germplasms were sowed
in experimental farms in three different latitudes of Har-
bin (45°75’N, 126°63’E), Changchun (43°88’N, 125°35’E)
and Shenyang (41°44’N, 123°30’E) in China using ran-
domized complete block designs with three replicates in
2015 and 2016. Each experimental block consisted of 2
m long rows with 0.6 m row spacing and 0.05 m plant
spacing. The soybean emergence stages and the repro-
ductive periods such as flowering time, full bloom, be-
ginning pod, full pod, beginning seed, and full seed were
recorded as described by Fehr and Caviness [56], and
the days from emergence to reproductive periods were
calculated. Each stage was defined to have occurred if at
least 50% of the individual plants of a given soybean var-
iety had reached that stage.

Statistical analysis
The descriptively statistical analyses were carried out by
SPSS19.0 [57]. The phenotypic data of flowering time,
full bloom, beginning pod, full pod, beginning seed, and
full seed for 278 soybean germplasms were ranked by in-
dividual cases and transformed into variables obeying
standard normal distribution using SPSS19.0 [57] for
correlation analysis, variance analysis (ANOVA) and
GGE biplot. Correlation analysis of flowering time and
full bloom, beginning pod, full pod, beginning seed, full
seed in six environments were identified using Pearson’s
correlation coefficients of “Performance Analytics” pack-
age in R software [31]. ANOVA was performed follow-
ing the standard procedure of a mixed effect model by
DPS v14.1.0 to determine the level of the significance of
genotype differences, locations, cultivation years and
their interactions [58]. Genotype and location were con-
sidered as fixed effects, while year was considered as a
random effect. The phenotypic observation Zijkr was
modeled as:
Zijkr ¼ μ þ Gi þ Lj þ Y k þ Br LjY k


þ GLij þ GY ik
þ LY jk þ GLY ijk þ eijkr
where Zijkr was the response variable; μ was the grand
mean; Gi was the genotype effect; Lj was the location
effect; Yk was the year effect; Br(LjYk) was the block
effect; GLij was the genotype-by-location interaction;
GYik was the genotype-by-year interaction; LYjk was
the
location-by-year
interaction;
GLYijk
was
the
genotype-by-location-by year interaction and eijkr was
the residual error. These components were used to
calculate
broad-sense
heritability
(h2)
for
soybean
flowering time, full bloom, beginning pod, full pod,
beginning seed, and full seed, the calculation is based
on the following formula [59]:
h2 ¼
σg2
σg2 þ σgy2=y þ σgl2=l þ σgly2=ly þ σε2=rly
where σg
2 was genotype, σgl
2 was genotype-by-location,
σgy
2 was genotype-by-crop year, σgly
2 was genotype-by-
location-by-crop year, σε
2 was error, r was number of
replications, l was number of locations and y was crop
years respectively.
GGE biplot completed by “GGEBiplotGUI” package in
R software [60] was used to screen the stable soybean
varieties with early flowering and late flowering in multi-
environment. The general model of GGE biplot based
on singular value decomposition (SVD) of environment-
centered or environment-standardized [61] could be
written as:
Y ij−μ−βj ¼ λ1ξi1ηj1 þ λ2ξi2ηj2 þ εij
where Yij was the measured mean of ith genotype in jth
environment; μ was the grand mean; βj was the main ef-
fect of jth environment; μ + βj was the average trait over all
genotypes in jth environment; λ1 and λ2 were the singular
values for the first and second principal component (PC1
and PC2); ξi1 and ξi2 were eigenvectors of ith genotype for
PC1 and PC2; ηj1 and ηj2 were eigenvectors of jth environ-
ment for PC1 and PC2; εij was the residual of the model
associated with ith genotype in jth environment.
Genotyping and quality control
The double enzyme group comprising MseI and HaeIII
(Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA.)
was used to digest the soybean genomic DNA that iso-
lated from the fresh leaves of a single plant [62] into
more than 50,000 sequencing tags, based on which, the
sequencing libraries of each accession were constructed
[33, 63]. The Short Oligonucleotide Alignment Program
2 was used to map raw paired-end reads of the 45 bp se-
quence read at both ends of the sequencing tags for each
library, which was obtained using the barcode approach
combined with the Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Illu-
mina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) onto the reference gen-
ome [64]. Approximately 58,000 high-quality SLAF tags
were obtained after sequencing reads with the same gen-
omic position of each accession. A total of 34,710 SNP
loci with missing rate less than 10% and minor allele fre-
quency (MAF) greater than 0.04 was used for GWAS.
Linkage disequilibrium (LD), population structure and
kinship analyses
Pairwise LD between 34,710 SNP loci with missing rate
less than 10% and MAF greater than 0.04 was estimated
using squared allele frequency correlations (r2) in TAS-
SEL 5.0, the LD decay rate of the population was mea-
sured as the chromosomal distance when r2 dropped to
half its maximum value [38, 65, 66]. The 34,710 SNP loci
were also used to perform principal component analysis
and calculate kinship matrixes by identity-by-state (IBS)
method implemented in TASSEL 5.0 to infer population
stratification and relatedness among individuals [65, 67].
GWAS and candidate genes prediction
The statistical mixed linear model (CMLM-PCA + K)
was used to perform GWAS using TASSEL 5.0 [65]. The
equation for the CMLM-PCA + K analysis was expressed
as:
y ¼ Xα þ Pβ þ Zu þ e
where y was phenotype value; α was the vector of SNP
effects; β was vector of population structure effects
based on PCA; u was vector of kinship background ef-
fects; e was vector of residual effects; X, P, Z were inci-
dence matrix relating the individuals to fixed marker

effects α, fixed principal component (PC) effects β, ran-
dom group effects u, respectively.
Bonferroni test P < 0.05/n or P < 0.01/n (n = 278), that
was -log10P > 3.75 or -log10P > 4.44, was used to deter-
mine the significant or extremely significant SNP-trait
associations. The R-based package snp.plotter was used
to comb the LD block of the significant SNPs, the candi-
date genes associated with soybean flowering time within
which were predicted using the SoyBase (https://www.
soybase.org) and TAIR (https://www.arabidopsis.org/)
databases.
