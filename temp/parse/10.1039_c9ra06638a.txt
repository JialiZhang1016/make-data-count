The monomeric diaminophosphinoboranes readily react with CO2 under mild conditions to cleanly form
products of the general formula R2P  Cð]OÞ  O  BðNR0
2Þ2 in the absence of a catalyst. The isolated
products
from
the
CO2-phosphinoboration
were
fully
characterized
by
NMR
spectroscopy,
IR
spectroscopy,
and
X-ray
diﬀraction.
The

of
CO2
phosphinoboration
with
diaminophosphinoboranes was elucidated by DFT calculations.
Introduction
Increasingly stringent environmental standards are prompting
us to look for clean and eﬃcient methods for the synthesis of
organic compounds. In recent years, much attention has been
focused on reactions employing simple, nonmetallic P,B-
based1–6 systems that can activate waste gases such as CO,7,8
CO2,9–13 NOx,10,14 SO2,14,15 or even H2.5,9,16–19 These metal-free
reactions not only involve easily accessible and inexpensive
gaseous reagents as the feedstock but also enable the straight-
forward and eﬃcient synthesis of organic compounds through
the functionalization of small inorganic molecules.20–26 The
resulting products can be directly used as substrates for the
synthesis of more complex systems that are diﬃcult or impos-
sible to obtain by other means.
The
largest
portion
of
reports
are
those
devoted
to
CO2
11,12,17,22,27 and its incorporation into organic molecules
under mild conditions. While highly nucleophilic phosphines
form stable adducts with CO2,11 boranes capture CO2 only in the
presence of a Lewis base12 that can act as either a stoichio-
metric4,27 or catalytic23 coreagent or as the site of the ambiphilic
molecule. One of the most common systems of this kind is
frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs), involving inter- or intramolecular
combinations of sterically encumbered Lewis acids and bases
that cannot quench each other.18 In the reaction of P,B-based
FLPs with CO2, the synergistic interactions of the P-center
with a carbon atom and the B-center with an oxygen atom
lead to the formation of P–C and B–O bonds, respectively, giving
zwitterionic products with the formula R3P  CðOÞ  O  BR0
3.27
In the vast majority of FLPs, the presence of highly electron-
withdrawing substituents to increase the acidity of the B atom
is crucial for eﬃcient CO2 xation. However, it was shown that
geminal FLPs, in which the donor and acceptor sites are sepa-
rated by one atom, can activate CO2 despite the mild Lewis
acidity of the boron center.28,29
These reports inspired us to go one step further and inves-
tigate whether systems in which the B atom is directly bound to
the phosphorus atom also activate CO2. Hence, we focused on
monomeric phosphinoboranes, which are another type of
ambiphilic P,B-based molecules.30,31 A recent very comprehen-
sive review31 by Pringle et al. classies these species containing
a single P–B bond with a pyramidal P atom and the general
formula R2P–BR2 as borylphosphines30,32,33 and those with
a double P]B bond and trigonal planar P atom and the general
formula R2P]BR0
2 as phosphinoboranes.34–36 Notably, we found
that there are a limited number of reports on the reactivity of
P–B bond systems towards small molecules. Phosphinoboranes
R2P]B(C6F5)2 (R ¼ tBu, Cy) exhibit FLP-like reactivity towards
H2.34,37 The Westcott group explored the chemistry of phosphi-
noboronate ester Ph2P–Bpin38 (pin ¼ 1,2-O2C2Me4), which
eﬀectively functionalizes a wide variety of heterorganic systems,
such as carbonyls,38,39 N-heterocycles,40 aldimines,38,39 carbo-
diimides41 and isocyanates.41 Very recently Wescott and Stephan
tested reactivity of R2PBpin (R ¼ Ph, tBu), R2PBMes2 (R ¼ Ph,
tBu), and R2PBcat (R ¼ Ph, tBu, Mes) towards CO2, where the
reactions with the rst and the second group of phosphino-
boranes
gave
R2PCO2Bpin
and
R2PCO2BMes
respectively,
whereas the reaction involving R2PBcat yielded (R2P)2CO and
O(Bcat)2.42
As a part of our research program on applying P–P bond
systems to the activation of small molecules, we recently re-
ported the rst example of CO2 diphosphination by unsym-
metrical diphosphanes43 in the presence of BPh3. Herein,
a weak Lewis acid catalyzes the insertion of CO2 into the P–P

bond of the Lewis basic component with the formation of P–C
and P–O bonds in a reversible manner (Scheme 1).44
Our studies revealed that the presence of long and polarized
P–P bonds is crucial for the activation of CO2 by diphosphanes.
Herein, we decided to apply this synthetic approach to trivalent
phosphorus and boron compounds with direct P–B bonds.
Results and discussion
To this end, we designed and synthesized a series of new
phosphinoboranes
1–3,
which
are
structural
analogs
of
unsymmetrical diphosphanes where one P atom has been
replaced by a B atom (Scheme 2). The rst step of the synthesis
was the reaction of BBr3 with a four-fold excess of iPr2NH in
petroleum ether with the elimination of an ammonium salt and
formation of the bromo(diamino)borane. Then, the obtained
product was used in the equimolar reaction with the corre-
sponding lithium phosphide (RR0PLi) in toluene at 50 C.
Diaminophosphinoboranes 1–3 were isolated by removal of the
LiBr followed by evaporation of the solvent, giving analytically
pure products in high yields (83–88%).
The 31P{1H} NMR spectra of 1, 2 and 3 show broad singlets at
8.0 ppm, 26.2 ppm and 36.1 ppm, respectively. The upeld
resonances in the 31P{1H} NMR spectra of 1–3 indicate a lack of
signicant P–B p-interaction within these molecules. The 11B
NMR spectra of 1–3 each exhibit only one broad singlet
(39.5 ppm (1); 40.4 ppm (2); and 38.8 ppm (3)) at values typical
for trivalent R2P  BR0
2 species.30,31 The broadness of the signals
in the 31P{1H} and 11B spectra can be explained by the quad-
rupolar nature of boron. Moreover, the 1JP–B coupling is not
visible likely because of the small value of this coupling
constant and mentioned broadness of the signals. The crystal-
lization from petroleum ether at 20 C resulted in colorless
crystals of 2 and 3. The X-ray structures of 2 and 3 are presented
in Fig. 1. The most characteristic structural features of 2 and 3
are the planar geometry of the N and B atoms with the sum of
the angles being close to 360, the pyramidal geometry of the P
atom (sum 323.8 (2); 316.95 (3)) and the very long B–P distance
(1.983(2) ˚A (2); 1.984(1) ˚A (3)). The B–P bond lengths in 2 and 3
are among the longest distances reported for phosphinobor-
anes,30,31 and they are even slightly longer than the sum of the
single covalent bond radii of B and P (1.96 ˚A).45
Moreover, the shortening of the B–N bonds in 2 and 3 to B–N
distances in the range of 1.425(1)–1.442(3) ˚A (sum of the single
covalent bond radii of B and N: 1.56 ˚A; sum of the double
covalent bond radii for B and N: 1.38 ˚A) was observed. 45,46 This
feature, together with the planar geometry of the N atom,
indicates signicant B–N p-bonding. NBO analysis of these
species provided further insight into the electronic structures of
1–3. The strong interaction between the lone pairs on the N
atoms and the formally empty p-orbital of the B atom resulting
from the formation of B–N p-bonds is clearly visible. Otherwise,
donor–acceptor interactions between the P and B centers are
very weak. Hence, the lone pair on the P atom is accessible for
reactions with electrophilic compounds. The nucleophilic and
electrophilic properties of 1–3 were studied by analysis of the
condensed Fukui functions. In general, 1–3 have strong nucle-
ophilic character with the nucleophilicity centered at the P
atom. The nucleophilicity of the diaminophosphinoboranes
increases in the order 3 < 2 < 1, where the values of fN for the P
atoms are 0.175, 0.198 and 0.277, respectively. Interestingly,
boron is neither a nucleophilic nor an electrophilic center; the
values of both the fN and fE Fukui functions are close to zero.
Taking into account the results of all the structural and NBO
analyses, 1–3 can be described as nucleophilic borylphosphine-
like species.
Next, we studied the reactivity of diaminophosphinoboranes
1–3 towards CO2. The reactions of 1, 2 or 3 with CO2 (1 atm) at
room temperature in toluene resulted in the formation of
phosphinoboration
products
1a,
2a
and
3a,
respectively
(Scheme 3). The reaction progress was monitored by 31P{1H}

and 11B NMR spectroscopy. The complete conversions of 1 into
1a and 2 into 2a took 3 hours. In contrast to experiments
involving 1 and 2, the reaction of less nucleophilic 3 with CO2 is
much slower and was complete aer 65 days.
The analytically pure 1a, 2a, and 3a were isolated in high
yields (87–94%) by evaporation of the solvent as colorless oils
solidied below 20 C. The 31P{1H} spectra of 1a, 2a and 3a
exhibit sharp singlets at 52.4 ppm, 23.5 and 1.0 ppm,
respectively. The signals are strongly downeld shied in
comparison to the corresponding resonance of the parent dia-
minophosphinoboranes, indicating a change in the coordina-
tion environment of the P atom. 1a, 2a, and 3a have very similar
11B NMR spectra, which show one resonance at a shiof
approximately 27 ppm. Furthermore, the 13C{1H} spectra of the
reaction products show a downeld doublet in the range of
180.2–177.9 ppm with 1JPC (30.9–7.3 Hz). Notably, the 31P{1H}
and 13C{1H} NMR data of 3a are very similar to those reported
for Ph2P–C(O)–O–Bpin.41 Moreover, the IR data for 1a and 2a
showed absorption bands at 1644 cm1 and 1664 cm1,
respectively, which are very characteristic for carbonyl groups.
X-ray diﬀraction studies of 1a and 2a unambiguously
conrmed that the CO2 molecule is incorporated between the B
and P atoms (Fig. 2). The X-ray structures of 1a and 2a are very
similar and will be discussed collectively. The CO2 moiety is
bound to the phosphanyl group via a carbon atom, whereas one
oxygen atom links this moiety with the boryl group. In
comparison to parent compounds 1 and 2, the planar geome-
tries of the B and N atoms and the pyramidal geometry of the P
atom are retained. The geometry of C1 is also planar. The P1–C1
(1.863(1) ˚A (1a), 1.851(5) ˚A (2a)) and B1–O1 (1.459(2) ˚A (1a),
1.452(6) ˚A (2a)) bonds values are consistent with single covalent
bonds.45 The P1–C1 distances in 1a and 2a are very similar to
corresponding bond distances in Ph2PCO2Bpin and Ph2PCO2-
BMes2, however B1–O1 bond lengths in 1a and 2a are about 0.05
˚A longer than in mentioned compounds.42 The C1–O1 (1.345(2)
˚A (1a), 1.351(5) ˚A (2a)) and C2]O2 (1.215(2) (1a), 1.218(6) ˚A (2a))
bond distances are very similar to those observed for carboxylic
esters (1.33–1.41 ˚A and 1.19–1.20 ˚A, respectively).47 The B–N
bond lengths in 1a and 2a are in the range of 1.408(1)–1.438(2) ˚A
and are slightly shorter than the corresponding distances in
parent species 1 and 2. The structures of 1a and 2a diﬀer
signicantly from known structures of CO2 activation products;
typically, inter- and intramolecular P,B-based frustrated Lewis
pairs form zwitterionic adducts containing tetra-coordinated P
and B centers.27 Compounds 1a, 2a, and 3a are stable under
argon or vacuum, and even heating these products up to 60 C
did not regenerate the parent diaminophosphinoboranes.
To investigate the mechanism of CO2 capture by the dia-
minophosphinoboranes and elucidate the diﬀerences in their
reactivities, we carried out DFT calculations. According to the
Gibbs energy prole, the insertion of carbon dioxide into the
P–B bond of 1 proceeds via a simple two-step mechanism
(Fig. 3).
The reaction starts with a nucleophilic attack of P on the
electrophilic CO2 atom. Upon attachment of C to the PtBu2
atom, the electron density shis towards the PCO2 moiety; the
value of the B(iPr2N)2 electrophilic Fukui function, fE, increases
from 0.001 for 1 to 0.152 for I (Table S10†). Consequently, the
B(iPr2N)2 atom becomes the electrophilic center of the mole-
cule, facilitating the formation of the B–O bond, and the
simultaneous cleavage of the P–B bond leads to the generation

of 1a. Although the values of the free energies (DG298) conrmed
that in the reaction with CO2, all three systems form stable
products via exergonic processes, the kinetics of these reactions
are notably diﬀerent (Table 1).
In general, as the nucleophilicity of the phosphorus atom in
1–3 decreases, the energy barrier DG‡ increases. A small aber-
ration is observed for 2a; PtBuPh is less nucleophilic than PtBu2
but is also less sterically hindered, and therefore, the value of
DG‡ is slightly lower for 2a (Fig. S41†). While 1 and 2 react with
CO2 in an analogous manner involving the generation of adduct
I, a PES scan of 3a revealed that the corresponding intermediate
is not formed along the reaction path (Fig. S42†). In this case,
the activation of CO2 proceeds via a single four-membered ring
transition state. This path requires the simultaneous interac-
tion of both reactive centers with CO2, which in conjunction
with the PPh2 atom being the least nucleophilic, justies the
highest energy barrier and the extremely long reaction time for
3.
We found it very interesting to compare the reactivities of
trivalent
species
containing
single
and
double
boron-
phosphorus
bonds
(Scheme

Stephan
and
coworkers
revealed that phosphinoboranes R2P]B(C6F5)2 (R ¼ tBu, Cy)
can activate dihydrogen34,37 (Scheme 4, bottom le); however,
we did not nd any reports on the reactivity of such species
towards CO2.
For this reason, we reacted a representative species, tBu2P]
B(C6F5)2
34,37 (A), with CO2 under the same conditions as
described for 1. The monitoring of the reaction mixture by 31P
{1H} and 11B spectroscopy showed that compound A does not
activate CO2. Furthermore, in the reaction of 1 with H2 con-
ducted under the same conditions, the 31P{1H} and 11B NMR
spectra revealed only signals of unreacted 1. The diﬀerences in
the reactivity of 1 and tBu2P]B(C6F5)2 towards H2 and CO2 can
be explained by their electronic structures. According to the
mechanism of H2 activation proposed by Stephan, the reaction
starts with the addition of H2 (H–H bond acts as a Lewis base) to
the Lewis acidic B-center of tBu2P]B(C6F5)2.34,37 In the case of 1,
the Lewis acidity of boron is quenched due to the strong
donation from both N atoms, which explains its lack of reac-
tivity towards H2. In regard to CO2, our mechanistic study
reveals that the presence of a strong nucleophilic P center with
an accessible lone pair is crucial for the activation of electro-
philic CO2. While compound 1 meets these conditions, in the
case of tBu2P]B(C6F5)2, the lone pair on the P atom is involved
in a strong donor–acceptor interaction with the B atom,
resulting in p-bonding.
Conclusions
We have synthesized a series of novel monomeric dia-
minophosphinoboranes which are not only eﬀective species for
functionalization of CO2 but are also promising systems for
activation of other small molecules. Our studies revealed which
factors are crucial for the activation of small molecules by
trivalent phosphorus and boron species with direct P–B bond
and how to design eﬀective systems of this kind. Studies on the
reactivity of diaminophosphinoboranes towards a wide range of
small, electrophilic molecules are currently in progress.
