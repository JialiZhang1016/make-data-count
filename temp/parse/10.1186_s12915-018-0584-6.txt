Abstract
Background: Upon maturation in the bone marrow, polyploid megakaryocytes elongate very long and thin
cytoplasmic branches called proplatelets. Proplatelets enter the sinusoids blood vessels in which platelets are
ultimately released. Microtubule dynamics, bundling, sliding, and coiling, drive these dramatic morphological
changes whose regulation remains poorly understood. Microtubule properties are defined by tubulin isotype
composition and post-translational modification patterns. It remains unknown whether microtubule post-
translational modifications occur in proplatelets and if so, whether they contribute to platelet formation.
Results: Here, we show that in proplatelets from mouse megakaryocytes, microtubules are both acetylated and
polyglutamylated. To bypass the difficulties of working with differentiating megakaryocytes, we used a cell model
that allowed us to test the functions of these modifications. First, we show that α2bβ3integrin signaling in D723H
cells is sufficient to induce β1tubulin expression and recapitulate the specific microtubule behaviors observed
during proplatelet elongation and platelet release. Using this model, we found that microtubule acetylation and
polyglutamylation occur with different spatio-temporal patterns. We demonstrate that microtubule acetylation,
polyglutamylation, and β1tubulin expression are mandatory for proplatelet-like elongation, swelling formation, and
cytoplast severing. We discuss the functional importance of polyglutamylation of β1tubulin-containing microtubules
for their efficient bundling and coiling during platelet formation.
Conclusions: We characterized and validated a powerful cell model to address microtubule behavior in mature
megakaryocytes, which allowed us to demonstrate the functional importance of microtubule acetylation and
polyglutamylation for platelet release. Furthermore, we bring evidence of a link between the expression of a
specific tubulin isotype, the occurrence of microtubule post-translational modifications, and the acquisition of
specific microtubule behaviors. Thus, our findings could widen the current view of the regulation of microtubule
behavior in cells such as osteoclasts, spermatozoa, and neurons, which express distinct tubulin isotypes and display
specific microtubule activities during differentiation.

Background
Megakaryocytes (MKs) are highly differentiated cells
whose function is to assemble and release platelets in the
blood stream. The production of platelets from mature
megakaryocytes occurs via the extension of long thin and
branched cytoplasmic processes named proplatelets [1–3].
Microtubules (MTs), one of the main structural compo-
nents of proplatelets, are absolutely required for the exten-
sion of proplatelets [4]. The driving force for proplatelet
extension is not driven by MT polymerization but results
from the bundling of MTs and their dynein-dependent
sliding past each other [5]. At the distal end of the propla-
telets, the MT bundle coils and re-enters the shaft forming
swellings with a unique circular MT ring [6]. These swell-
ings are severed and released into the blood stream as
platelets or bigger circular platelet intermediates called
preplatelets [1]. An elegant study showed that preplatelets
can reversibly change to barbell-shaped platelet structures
by twisting their MT ring. Barbell structure, containing a
platelet-sized MT coil at each end, is further cleaved in
two platelets [1]. The MT ring persists in the periphery of
the platelets and is known as the marginal band. It exerts
forces that maintain the discoid shape of the resting plate-
let [7]. MT transitions observed during platelet activation
could result from molecular motors that drive marginal
band elongation and induce its supercoiling/buckling [8].
However, visco-elasticity of the marginal band itself allows
it to adapt its shape. Indeed, a recent modeling study
shows that a rapid increase in cortical tension, too fast for
MT cross linker reorganization, overcomes MT bundle ri-
gidity and induces marginal band supercoiling [9].
Given the crucial role of the MT network, one key
step is to understand the spatio-temporal regulation of
MT dynamics in these giant cells. MT-binding proteins
regulate MT functions. Interactions of these MT-binding
proteins with MTs are controled by both tubulin isotype
content and post-translational modifications (PTMs) of
MTs [10, 11]. An hematopoietic-specific tubulin isotype,
tubulin beta1 class VI (β1tubulin), is expressed only in
late mature megakaryocytes and accounts for 90% of the
total beta tubulin pool in platelets [12]. TUBB1−/−mice
suffer from thrombocytopenia and extensive bleeding
[13]. Their platelets have defective marginal bands with
reduced MT coils pointing to specific functions of
β1tubulin in platelet structure and functions. In humans,
TUBB1 mutations are also linked to macrothrombocyto-
penia, altered MT dynamics and/or assembly [14–17].
Mechanisms that confer specific functions to this tubu-
lin in MT coiling are not yet understood. Whether MT
PTMs are present in megakaryocytes is not yet known,
but the marginal band of resting platelets is heavily acet-
ylated, and platelet activation induces a massive MT
deacetylation, which is mediated by the tubulin deacety-
lase HDAC6 [18].
Beautiful live imaging strikingly revealed MT dynamics
in proplatelets and platelet intermediates (reviewed in
[19]). Nevertheless, the role of PTMs in the regulation
of MT behavior has not been addressed due to the diffi-
culties inherent to differentiate megakaryocytes in vitro
and to the absence of a reliable cell model.
Platelet membrane complex, GPIb-IX-V, and platelet fi-
brinogen receptor, integrin αIIbβ3, regulate proplatelet
formation and platelet release [20, 21], although the mo-
lecular mechanisms involved remain poorly understood.
Several years ago, a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)--
based cell model was developed [22]. The expression of
partially activated αIIbβ3D723H integrins in these cells in-
duced fibrinogen-dependent, MT-driven proplatelet-like
extensions (PPLLs) [22, 23]. Yet, the capacity of these
cytoplasmic elongations to induce MT rearrangements
similar to megakaryocyte-derived proplatelets was not in-
vestigated. Here, we characterized this cell model in depth.
We show that αIIbβ3D723H integrin signaling nicely reca-
pitulates PPLL elongation, swelling formation, and sever-
ing accompanied with MT bundling, coiling, and marginal
band-like formation. We used this model to highlight the
importance of MT acetylation and polyglutamylation dur-
ing proplatelet-like elongation.
Results
β1tubulin-containing MTs of proplatelets extending from
megakaryocytes are acetylated and polyglutamylated
Microtubule PTMs in megakaryocytes are not well char-
acterized. We found that β1tubulin isotype containing
microtubules (MTs) are highly polyglutamylated (PolyE-)
and acetylated (Ac-) in extending proplatelets of mouse
embryonic liver-derived megakaryocytes (Fig. 1a). In
some
instances,
discrete
differences
of
PolyE-
and
Ac-tubulin staining could be observed (Fig. 1a, arrow).
In order to address whether these MT PTMs have spe-
cific functions during proplatelet elongation, we took ad-
vantage of a previously described Chinese hamster ovary
cell line (D723H cells). These cells express a constitutive
but partially activated mutant αIIbβ3 integrin (β3D723H
mutation) which upon binding to its fibrinogen ligand, in-
duces MT-dependent elongation of one or two cytoplas-
mic branches (PPLL) that form swellings at their growing
ends [22, 24]. However, whether D723H cells can recap-
itulate MT behavior observed in megakaryocyte-derived
proplatelets or allow the formation of platelet-like cyto-
plasts was not reported.
Partial activation of αIIbβ3 integrin signaling in CHO cells
recapitulates MT bundling, MT coiling, and cytoplast severing
observed in differentiating MKs extending proplatelets
As previously described [22], when spread on fibrinogen,
D723H cells formed PPLL extensions with dynamic
swellings at their tips while αIIbβ3 wild-type-expressing

(Additional file 1: Figure S1A, Additional file 2: Movie S1,

observed the occurrence of swelling cleavage and release
of cytoplasts in the cell culture medium (Fig. 1b,

initially reported [22], we found that these swellings are
colonized by bundled MTs (Additional file 1: Figure
S1B). Typically, several MT coils were observed in
thin-section
electron
micrographs
of
the
swellings
(Fig. 1c, right panels, arrows) in agreement with the 7–
12 MT coils reported for platelets [25].
GFP-EB3/mCherry-lifeAct live cell imaging showed
that swelling’s shape evolves with time. mCherry-lifeAct
reveals the dynamic cortical actin ring while GFP-EB3
marks growing MT plus tips (Additional file 1: Figure
S1C). Fluorescent tubulin live imaging confirms our
electron microscopy data and shows that MTs in the
swellings are bundled (Additional file 1: Figure S1D,
Additional file 5: Movie S4). Some of the MTs in the
bundles are highly dynamic as seen by imaging EB3
comets every second. EB3 comets enter the swellings
and turn around while some reenter the branch shaft, as
better visualized using colored time projections (Fig. 1d,
Additional file 6: Movie S5). To further confirm that
MT bundles that enter a newly forming swelling are dy-
namic, we used fluorescent recovery after photobleach-
ing (FRAP) (Fig. 1e, Additional file 7: Movie S6) which
shows an example of fluorescent tubulin reincorporated
as soon as 5 s after MT bleaching. Finally, we observed
that
D723H
cells
produce
barbell-like
structures
containing dynamic EB3 comets (Additional file 1:
Figure S1E, Additional file 8: Movie S7), similar to
well-described barbell platelet intermediates formed dur-
ing megakaryocyte differentiation and platelet release.
Our data show that αIIbβ3 integrin engagement in
D723H cells is sufficient to induce a behavior that
closely resembles proplatelet elongation upon megakar-
yocyte differentiation and that is characterized by the dy-
namic
behavior
of
PPLL
MTs
together
with
MT
bundling/coiling occurring in the swellings and ultim-
ately the severing of these swellings.
Acetylation and polyglutamylation decorate MT bundles and
the marginal band-like structure during PPLL elongation
We further used this unique cell model to study the im-
portance of MT PTMs during PPLL elongation and
platelet release.
As observed for megakaryocytes (Fig. 1a), in D723H
cell spreading on fibrinogen the spatial localization of
Ac- is different of PolyE-MTs (Fig. 2a). Indeed, Ac-MTs
initially (1 h) surrounded centrosomes and later (5 h)
concentrated along the elongating PPLL. In contrast,
PolyE-MT staining was enhanced toward the PPLL distal
end (1–5 h). After 24 h, long PPLL extensions were filled
with Ac- and polyE-bundled MTs. In swellings at the tip
of elongations, PolyE strongly stained MT rings, remin-
iscent of the platelet marginal band [7]. While starved
cells or cells grown in the presence of serum show simi-
lar polyE- and Ac-MT content, resuspended cells prior
fibrinogen spreading had lost most of these MT PTMs
(Additional file 9: Figure S2). Most importantly, during
the spreading kinetic of these resuspended D723H cells
on fibrinogen, a progressive increase in Ac-MT content
was observed cells while PolyE-MTs remained constant.
This change in Ac-MTs was not observed in WT cells
indicating that the upregulation of Ac-MTs may be im-
portant for sustained PPLL elongation (Fig. 2b).
In resting platelets, marginal band MTs are acetylated
[26] but little is known about other MT PTMs. Platelets
become activated while spreading on glass coverslips.
We observed that marginal band MTs of resting, still
round platelets stained both for Ac- and PolyE-MTs, but
the
modification
patterns
only
partially
overlapped
(arrowheads) (Fig. 2c). In contrast, in fully activated
spread platelets (arrows), polyE-MTs were lost, as has
already been reported for Ac-MTs in which α-tubulin
deacetylase HDAC6 mediates deacetylation [18]. Since
MT coiling evolves during platelet activation [8, 27], we
hypothesized that Ac- and PolyE-MTs could mark differ-
ent platelet activation states. Indeed, differential PTM
staining is best seen on a single human platelet with MT
buckling (Fig. 2d, left) and resembles the PTM pattern
of MTs in D723H swellings (Fig. 2d, right).
Taken together, our data show that acetylation and
polyglutamylation marks on MTs of D723H cells elong-
ating PPLL are distinct and dynamic. Moreover, D723H
cells activate signaling pathways that induce swellings
containing marginal band-like MT ring with similar size
and PTM pattern to that of blood platelets.
β1 tubulin is expressed in D723H cells. Behavior of highly
polyglutamylated and β1 tubulin-containing MTs is
similar in MKs and in D723H cells
Since proper platelet marginal band formation requires
the expression of the megakaryocyte/platelet-specific
β1tubulin
isotype,
we
wondered
whether
β1tubulin
could be expressed under α2bβ3 integrin signaling in
D723H cells.
Using immunoblot, we observe that β1tubulin is
expressed in platelets but also in D723H cells spreading
on fibrinogen. In contrast, NIH3T3-L1 and C2C12
mouse cells display almost no reactivity with mouse β1
tubulin antibodies (Fig. 3a). Strikingly, β1tubulin-positive
MTs, in D723H cells spreading on fibrinogen, concen-
trate in the dynamic protrusive end of PPLLs which are
also highly polyglutamylated (Fig. 3b). Representative ex-
amples of β1tubulin and PolyE costaining (one Z sec-
tion) at different stages of MT bundling in elongating
PPLLs and in a severed barbell-like structure show that
most β1tubulin pixels colocalize with PolyE-MTs (Fig. 3c
left panels). We also present maximum intensity projec-
tion of D723H cells severed cytoplast structures visual-
ized by actin staining (Fig. 3c right panels).

Expression of β1tubulin isotype is restricted to mature
MKs extending PPL [12, 13]. Costaining of mouse
liver-derived MKs with high dilution of polyE- and
β1tubulin antibodies shows that, as we already observed in
D723H cells, a gradient of β1tubulin-containing MTs exist
in PPL of mouse MKs. This is better visualized by sub-
stracting total tubulin staining from respectively β1tubulin
and polyE MTs staining (Fig. 3d). We then looked at PolyE
stained and β1tubulin-containing MTs in human platelets.
In healthy donors, platelet marginal band MTs which
essentially contain β1tubulin, as a β isotype, are heavily
polyglutamylated. Blood smears of patients with a hetero-
zygous Tubb1 pF260S mutation contain only few platelets
with strong MT disorganization, as reported [14]. In these
patient platelets, we could not detect any polyglutamyla-
tion modification of these MT-like structures suggesting
that a threshold of β1-tubulin-containing MTs must be
attained to signal to polyglutamylases (Fig. 3e).

Our results show that in D723H cells, β1tubulin is
expressed upon spreading on fibrinogen and locally
enriched to the polyglutamylated part of the MTs that col-
onizes the extending PPLL. The potential link between
β1tubulin
expression
and
MT
polyglutamylation
is
strengthened by our observations of mouse MKs. These
original results further validate the D723H cell model to
study microtubule PTMs during PPLL elongation.

MT acetylation is required for PPLL extension
We first investigated the function of tubulin acetylation in
PPLL extensions by siRNA of the acetyl transferase
MEC-17 in D723H cells spreading on fibrinogen. MEC-17
depletion prevented MT acetylation, while levels of total
and PolyE-MTs remained constant. Whereas control
luciferase-depleted
cells
extended
PPLLs
containing
Ac-MTs, MEC-17-depleted cells, which did not show
acetylated MTs, remained square-shaped. This suggests
that Ac-MTs are required for PPLL elongation (Fig. 4a).
To confirm this, we performed partial MEC-17 deple-
tion and treated cells with trichostatin A (TSA), a
pan-HDAC inhibitor [28]. Under partial MEC-17 deple-
tion, MT acetylation was faintly detectable. TSA addition
stabilized the remaining Ac-MTs, but did not change the
steady state level of MEC-17 (Fig. 4b). Immunofluores-
cence showed that MEC-17-depleted cells in which
Ac-MTs were not rescued by TSA treatment did not ex-
tend PPLL, whereas cells harboring Ac-MTs extended
long protrusions. We quantified PPLL elongation by
measuring the cell AR ratio (ratio of the cell major/
minor axis). This confirmed the partial rescue of PPLL
elongation by TSA-induced stabilization of Ac-MTs in
MEC-17-depleted cells (Fig. 4b).
To study whether PPLL elongation only depends upon
increasing MT acetylation, we treated WT cells with low
doses of TSA, to mimic the Ac-MT level observed in
D723H cells (Additional file 10: Figure S3A, left panel).
TSA treatment induced cytoplasmic protrusions with
several branches in WT cells (Additional file 10: Figure
S3A, middle panel), but they did not elongate as much
as
in
D723H
cells,
as
quantified
by
AR
ratio
(Additional file 10: Figure S3A, right panel) and did not
produce swellings at their ends.
Since lengthening of PPLL in D723H cells correlates
with increased Ac-MTs, we wondered whether boosting
the MT acetylation would result in longer PPLLs and/or
more swellings. D723H cell spreading on fibrinogen
were followed by live microscopy. After 2 h spreading,
either TSA, the HDAC6-specific inhibitor tubastatin
(TBSA), or vehicle was added to culture medium (00:00,
Additional file 10: Figure S3B). In the presence of ve-
hicle, PPLL continued to lengthen with time and swell-
ings formed at their ends (Additional file 11: Movie S8).
In contrast, TSA (Additional file 11: Movie S9) and
TBSA (Additional file 11: Movie S10) treatment strongly
inhibited PPLL lenghtening, as cytoplasmic branches
widened over time and no swelling formation was ob-
served. As TSA is toxic, cells were not imaged longer
than 9 h after drug addition.
Next, we studied the importance of Ac-MTs in mouse
liver-derived megakaryocytes elongating proplatelets. In
vehicle-treated megakaryocytes, as expected, once pro-
platelet elongation is induced (07:30), many bead-like
swellings are formed along the processes prior to platelet
intermediates and platelets being released. The entire
process takes several hours and results in megakaryocyte
death
(12:30)
(Additional
file
10:
Figure
S3C
and
Additional file 12: Movie S11). In contrast, addition of
TBSA to megakaryocytes starting to elongate proplate-
lets (02:30) resulted in an arrest of the development of
the proplatelet network which started to fuse to form
stable giant lamellipodia (Additional file 10: Figure S3C
and Additional file 12: Movie S12).
These data demonstrate that an increase in Ac-MT is
required for efficient PPLL elongation in D723H cells,
but is not sufficient to induce PPLL in WT cells. They
also highlight the requirement for a regulation of the
Ac-MT level both in D723H cells and in mouse MKs to
protect the morphology of the elongating PPLLs.
MT polyglutamylation is important to induce MT marginal
band-like formation
The bundled MTs are heavily polyglutamylated in the
swellings of PPLLs induced by αIIbβ3 D723H signaling,
and in megakaryocyte-derived proplatelets (Figs. 1a, 2a,
and 3b–d). To better investigate the function of MT
polyglutamylation, we wished to increase the number of
swellings formed, since D723H cells only produce in
average one or two PPLL per cell.
Although the relationship between increasing megakar-
yocyte ploidy and platelet production is still a matter of
debate [29, 30], we hypothesized that polyploidization of
D723H cells could induce more processes. We thus used
the Aurora-A inhibitor, MLN8237, that was further de-
scribed to selectively inhibit Aurora B and induce poly-
ploidy
at
higher
concentration
[31].
In
preliminary
experiments, we found that in D723H cells, MLN8237
concentrations above 200 nM induced cell endomitosis
followed by polyploidization with no loss of cell viability.
We thus treated D723H cells with 400 nM MLN8237 for
6 to 78 h. FACS analyses of DNA content showed that
lenghtening exposure time to MLN8237 correlated with
increased cell ploidy, with 16N being attained by 78 h
treatment
(Additional
file
13:
Figure
S4A).
Upon
spreading on fibrinogen, polyploidization is accompanied
by an increase in cell size and it correlates with increased
numbers of PPLLs and more branching per PPLL, which
results
in
the
production
of
more
swellings
(Additional file 13: Figure S4B-S4C and Additional file 14:
Movies S13-15). Spreading WT cells on fibrinogen or
D723H cells on serum did not reproduce efficient PPLL
elongation nor swelling formation (Additional file 13:
Figure S4D and Additional file 14: Movies S16-18) further
demonstrating the dependence of PPLL elongation for
αIIbβ3D723H signaling. The MT network organization
and MT PTMs in polyploid D723H cells (Additional file 13:
Figure S4E) was similar to that of diploid cells (Fig. 2a).

The intensity of PolyE-MT staining was elevated in
swellings from MLN-treated D723H cells whereas total
MT staining was not (Fig. 5a, left panels), indicating
hyperglutamylation of these MTs. STED superresolution
microscopy confirmed that the shape and volume occu-
pied by marginal band-like PolyE-MT bundles in swell-
ings are consistent with sizes reported for platelets
derived from megakaryocytes (Fig. 5a, right panel). In
MLN-treated D723H cells, depletion of TTLL5 polyglu-
tamylase by siRNA removed most of the PolyE-MTs sig-
nal without affecting the Ac-tubulin signal (Fig. 5b, c).
Loss of TTLL5 induced dramatic cell shape changes and
an almost complete loss of extensions, as quantified
(Fig. 5b, c). In the remaining short protrusions, MTs at
the edges of the cells were always marked by leftover
polyglutamylation, again indicating that this MT PTM is
important to lead the PPLL elongation (Fig. 5b).
Our results show the requirement of MT polyglutamy-
lation for efficient PPLL elongation in D723H cells. The
striking localization of PolyE marks to the bundling MTs
at the leading edge of the PPLL points out to novel func-
tions of this MT PTM.

β1tubulin expression and MT polyglutamylation depend
upon each other for efficient MT bundling and coiling
during PPLL elongation
The importance of the β1tubulin isotype in proper MT
marginal band formation in platelets is well known, but
the mechanisms involved are not understood. We found
that a low level of β1tubulin expression is correlated
with high MT polyglutamylation (Fig. 3). To better
understand if there exists a relationship between β1tubu-
lin
expression
and
polyglutamylation,
we
depleted
β1tubulin and TTLL5 by siRNA in polyploid D723H
cells. β1tubulin was only partially depleted in D723H
cells, and its depletion did not affect total tubulin nor
acetyl-tubulin levels (Fig. 6a, left; Additional file 15:
Figure S5A). While TTLL5 depletion affected the poly-
glutamylase expression, and consequently PolyE-MT
levels, depletion of β1tubulin did not (Fig. 6a, right). As
shown before, control depleted cells extend long PPLLs
with at their ends, swellings that contain highly coiled
β1tubulin-containing
PolyE-MTs.
In
contrast,
such
swellings did not form upon loss of β1tubulin. Cytoplas-
mic elongations that extend from the cell body remained
larger and were filled with PolyE-MTs, but extreme
fasciculation of these PolyE-MTs did not occur (Fig. 6c
and Additional file 15: Figure S5B). As observed earlier
(Fig. 5b), loss of TTLL5 essentially prevented elongation
of
cytoplasmic
branches
and

knockdowns on cell shape were quantified using different
parameters. The circularity changes reflect that in β1tubu-
lin, unlike in TTLL5-depleted cells, PolyE-MTs induce
cytoplasmic elongations, but perimeter and area values
show that they do not extend far (Fig. 6b). The correlation
between MT polyglutamylation and β1tubulin-containing
MTs was confirmed in TTLL5-depleted cells with
residual polyE-MTs. In these star-like cells, the low
level of PolyE-MTs was systematically concentrated
at the leading edges of the small protrusions and

β1tubulin, and common β4 tubulin isotypes, in D723H
cells. We did not detect, in immunofluorescence, in-
creased polyglutamylation of β1tubulin-containing MTs
(Additional file 15: Figure S5C). This could reflect the
poor incorporation of gfp-β1tubulin in MTs. Alternately,
β1tubulin targeting to pioneer MTs and/or its coexpres-
sion with a specific and yet unknown αtubulin isotype
might be required for effective alpha or beta tubulin
polyglutamylation of MTs.
We show that β1tubulin expression is mandatory for
PPLL elongation. β1tubulin does not regulate the poly-
glutamylation level of MTs, but PolyE-MTs devoid of
β1tubulin isotype are no longer capable of bundling nor
coiling. We provide the first insight that the intimacy be-
tween β1tubulin-containing MTs and polyglutamylation
is required for proper MT fasciculation and coiling re-
quired for platelet release.
Discussion
Previous elegant works highlighted the importance of MT
dynamics and dynein-dependent MT sliding for proplate-
let elongation [5, 32]. Knock-out mice models and cul-
tured
megakaryocyte
studies
implicated
Rac/Cdc42
GTPases and their p21-activated kinase (PAK) effector,
PKC substrate MARCKS, RhoA, and its effector DIAPH1
[33–37] in the regulation of MT and/or actin networks.
Moreover, mutations in cytoskeleton-associated proteins,
such as FLNA, ACTN1, MYH9, or TUBB1, were identi-
fied in patients affected by proplatelet defects and
thrombocytopenia [15, 38–40].
However, due to difficulties in manipulating megakar-
yocytes and lack of models to modulate cytoskeleton ele-
ments throughout proplatelet elongation, these pathways
remain poorly understood.
The platelet membrane GPIb-IX-V complex is important
for proplatelet formation [20], but engagement of αIIbβ3
integrin on fibrinogen is sufficient to initiate proplatelet
formation from mouse megakaryocytes [21]. Expression in
CHO cells of a constitutive but partially activated αIIbβ3
integrin (D723H cells) was shown to promote elongation
of MT-dependent cytoplasmic branches [22, 23]. Here, we
characterized D723H cells. We demonstrate that engage-
ment of αIIbβ3D723H integrin to fibrinogen is sufficient
to recapitulate MT behavior previously described in cul-
tured megakaryocytes elongating proplatelet [19, 41]. In
that regard, D723H cell is a unique tool to study the regu-
lation of MT rearrangements.
Fibrinogen-engaged D723H cells elongating proplatelets
are filled with dynamic MTs that bundle toward the tip of
the elongation. Electron microscopy, 3D SIM, and STED
microscopy approaches show that MT coiling occurs in
the terminal swellings and that cytoplasts are released in
cell culture medium. In mature polyploid megakaryocytes,
recruitment of the demarcation membrane system (DMS)
[42] together with actin signaling allows the elongation
and branching of the proplatelet [5] and results in the for-
mation of multiple swellings from a single megakaryocyte.
To overcome the limitation of diploid D723H cells, which
promote elongation of only one or two PPLL, we induced
D723H cell polyploidization. Strikingly, polyploidization
not only increased the number of PPLLs but also their
branching activity, resulting in the production of multiple
swellings per cell, probably as a result of a bigger protein/
lipid reservoir. However, polyploid D723H cells never pro-
duced cytoplasts in amount similar to the estimated 4000
platelets produced by one mature megakaryocyte. We did
not investigate membrane remodeling or actin dynamics
in polyploid D723H cells, but since cytoplasmic accumu-
lation of mRNAs/proteins promotes PPLL branching, we
believe the activation of the actin machinery by D723H in-
tegrin signaling is likely. Importantly, severed cytoplasts
were observed throughout the cell culture medium, which
demonstrates that proteins necessary to the PPLL shaft
thinning are expressed before severing occurrence.
We observed that PPL-MTs from fixed mouse mega-
karyocytes are extensively modified by both acetylation
and polyglutamylation with discrete differences in the
PTM pattern of MTs. Using the D723H cell model, we
found that acetylation and polyglutamylation differently
mark the PPLL MTs. MT acetylation occurred along the
MTs colonizing the extending PPLL, and its steady state
level increased with elongation kinetics likely because
more “MT substrates” become available. MT acetylation
is required for PPLL elongation and must be regulated
since excessive acetylation induces PPLL widening and
prevents swelling formation. Thus, tight control of the
balance between MT-acetylating and deacetylating en-
zymes must occur for efficient PPLL elongation. Inter-
estingly,
MT acetylation
mediates
dynein-dependent
transport of mitochondria during inflammasome activa-
tion [43] and enhances dynein binding in vitro and in
vivo [44]. It would thus be of interest, in future studies,
to study whether Ac-MTs mediate dynein recruitment
on MTs and consequently the dynein-dependent MT
sliding mechanism required for PPLL elongation [5].
In the D723H cell model, we observed polyglutamyla-
tion of MTs in the most dynamic growing region of the
PPLL, in the swellings and in severed cytoplasts in which
coiling and even buckling occurred. Fibrinogen engage-
ment to αIIbβ3D723H integrin in CHO cells is sufficient
to recapitulate specific hematopietic features such as the
remarkable MT marginal band structures described in
preplatelets, barbell platelets, and platelets. In the mega-
karyocyte lineage, these MT structures depend upon the
expression of mature megakaryocyte-specific β1tubulin
isotype [13], although why this is the case is unknown.
Curiously, β1tubulin is expressed when mature megakar-
yocytes start to elongate proplatelets [12] indicating that
van Dijk et al. BMC Biology          (2018) 16:116

earlier expression might be toxic and suggesting a specific
role of this isotype in proplatelet extension. We found that
β1tubulin is actually expressed in D723H cells. Interest-
ingly, the C-terminal tail of β1tubulin is the most diver-
gent sequence from all other tubulin isotypes. It is
noteworthy that this completely unstructured peptide is
the target of polyglutamylases in all tubulin isotypes.
During PPLL elongation, we show a strong correlation
between localized enrichment of polyglutamylation and
β1tubulin incorporation in MTs. Loss of β1tubulin pre-
vented a good fasciculation of the polyE-MTs in the far
end of the elongating PPLL while not affecting their
steady
state
level.
However,
ectopic
expression
of
β1tubulin-gfp failed to prove that its C-terminal tail con-
tains specific signals to attract polyglutamylases. We,
therefore, are currently investigating whether β1tubulin
targeting to the dynamic MTs colonizing the far end of
the PPLL may be required for signaling to polyglutamy-
lases. Moreover, while we show that polyglutamylation
of β1tubulin-containing MTs is required for platelet for-
mation, we could not determine whether it is β1tubulin
itself or its associated specific α subunit heterodimer
partner that is a target of polyglutamylation. The fact
that depletion of TTLL5, an enzyme shown to have a
preference for alpha tubulins in mammalian cells [45],
removes the polyglutamylation of β1tubulin-containing
MTs opens the possibility that β1tubulin recruits and/or
stabilizes the polyglutamylase on the MT as it modifies
the neighboring α tubulin subunit.
Valenstein and Roll-Mecak [46] showed, using purified
tubulins, that polymerized MTs with defined levels of glu-
tamate residues recruit and activate the MT-severing en-
zyme spastin. Spastin recruitment/affinity increases with
length of the glutamate chains, but its activity peaks be-
fore being inhibited by a biphasic mechanism. Long polyE
chain-MTs loaded with spastin in a non-productive bind-
ing mode induce MT stabilization [46]. These findings ex-
plain earlier observations of MT cross-linking activity of
inactive spastin mutants [47, 48]. Our observations of MT
behavior during PPLL elongation fit nicely with this
model. At the beginning of PPLL elongation, MTs are
highly acetylated and MT severing is likely to occur to
promote elongation by dynein-dependent MT sliding.
Severing might require Ac-MT-dependent induction of
katanin severing enzyme [49] or spastin activation by
short polyE chain-containing MTs. In contrast, when
PPLLs are long enough, the PPLL shaft becomes thinner
and
contains
extremely
fasciculated
and
highly
polyglutamylated-β1tubulin-containing MTs, which could
be a reservoir for inactive spastin protein. It is indeed diffi-
cult to assess the length of PolyE chains on tubulins in
vivo, and more work will be needed to confirm this model.
Although we did not identify the mechanism of polygluta-
mylase recruitment to β1tubulin-containing MTs, we
propose these β1tubulin-MTs could tune polyglutamyla-
tion and consequently spastin activity. This would be con-
sistent with the extensive damage of the MT network
induced by overexpression of β1tubulin in CHO cells [50].
The marginal band MTs present in platelets maintain
their flat discoid morphology [7]. Modeling and in vitro
approaches showed that without any MT motors, MTs
spontaneously organize and coil longitudinally along the
wall of elongated microchambers [51] and that cortical
tension is required together with marginal band MT
stiffness to determine the platelet size [9]. We observed
that during platelet activation, buckled marginal bands
are differently modified by MT PTMs. It will be interest-
ing to address MT PTM functions in platelet size and
shape evolution by modeling approaches.
Among platelet disorders, Glanzmann thrombastenia
(GT; dysfunction of αIIbβ3 integrin) and Bernard Soulier
syndrome (BBS; dysfunction of GPIb-IX-V complex) affect
platelet surface glycoproteins. Mutations in these re-
ceptors, which mediate platelet aggregation, induce
mild to extremely severe patient bleeding. In addition,
these
receptors
are
also
involved
in
proplatelet
formation and the reorganization of MT cytoskeleton
[52, 53]. Remarkably, in a BBS mouse model, fewer
but
larger
platelets
contain
increased
number
of
microtubule coils in an oversized microtubule mar-
ginal band [53]. Changes in the MT content of plate-
let marginal band was also reported in other giant
platelet disorders such as MYH9-related disorders or
Gray platelet syndrome [54, 55]. But today, these observa-
tions remain poorly documented and are still not under-
stood. Indeed, these defects in MT coil size and coiling
efficiency derive from mutations in completely unrelated
genes inducing different signaling cascades. In this con-
text, it would be of interest to study the correlation be-
tween MT acetylation/polyglutamylation and MT coiling
and bundling in the giant platelets of patients affected by
these different disorders.
Conclusions
In this study, we established and validated a convenient
cell model that recapitulates the MT behavior observed
in megakaryocytes elongating proplatelets from the bone
marrow through the blood sinusoids. We demonstrate
that these highly specific hematopoietic features can be
phenocopied by αIIbβ3 integrin engagement on fibrino-
gen independently of any other hematopoietic signaling.
Our results reveal the importance of MT acetylation and
polyglutamylation for efficient rearrangements of MTs
during proplatelet elongation and platelet release. We
provide
the
first
insights
of
how
the
elusive
hematopoietic
β1tubulin
isotype
could
function
in
microtubule coiling.

Our study more broadly suggests that temporal ex-
pression of tubulin isotypes in differentiating specialized
cells could signal specific MT post-translational modifi-
cations and acquisition of specific MT behavior.
Methods
Cell lines
CHO cells expressing integrin αIIbβ3WT or D723H were
a kind gift of Dr. Kieffer; both cell lines were previously
described [23]. αIIbβ3 integrin expression at the cell sur-
face was periodically verified by incubating live cells with
A2A9 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Cat# sc-21783,
RRID:AB_627817), a conformational and blocking anti-
body that recognizes the native integrin complex, prior fix-
ation, and immunofluorescence (C2C12 mouse myoblast
ATCC Cat# CRL-1772, RRID:CVCL_0188, 3T3-L1 mouse
fibroblast (ATCC Cat# CCL-92.1, RRID:CVCL_0123)). All
cell lines were grown according to the standard protocols.
All cell lines were routinely tested for the absence of
mycoplasma contamination.
Megakaryocytes
The livers from E13.5 pregnant OF1 female mouse em-
bryos were placed in RPMI medium. Megakaryocytes
were differentiated for 4 days from murine E13.5 fetal
liver cells with 50 ng/ml TPO [56]. Animal experiments
were conducted according to procedures approved by
the local (agreement number 34-366 for B.B.B.) and
Regional Ethics committees.
Platelets
Nontherapeutic buffy-coat diluted in PBS was centri-
fuged (10 min, 400g), platelet-rich plasma was collected,
and platelets (106/well, 24-well plate) were spun 3 min
(600 g) on glass coverslips and fixed. For peripheral
blood smears of a woman with TUBB1 p.F260S muta-
tion, written informed consent was obtained from her in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinski. The Insti-
tutional Review boards of Nagoya Medical Center and
Miyagi Chidren’s Hospital approved the study [14].
Antibodies and reagents
Rabbit antibodies against alpha tubulin C102 was a gift
of M. Andreu [57]. Mouse β1tubulin was raised against
its C-terminal 19 aa peptide [15].
The
polyclonal
polyglutamylated
tubulin
antibody
(polyE-tub) was developed against Cys (Glu)9 peptide
coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin [45] and was first
described by M Gorovsky [58]; it only recognizes long
glutamate side chains (> 3 glutamates). The monoclonal
glutamylated tubulin antibody GT335 (PolyE*-Tub, (Adi-
poGen Cat# AG-20B-0020, RRID:AB_2490210, batch
A27791601) recognizes the branching site where glutam-
ate residues are added and react with both short and
long glutamate side chains. It also reacts with polygluta-
mylated nucleosome assembly protein 1 (NAP1) that is
nuclear and gives a signal just above the one of polyglu-
tamylated tubulin in Western blot. Depending on other
antibodies used in the experiments, either polyE or
PolyE* were used. Both antibodies stained the same MT
bundles and coils, in all described experiments.

Plasmid sfGFP-EB3-7 (Addgene plasmid # 56481) and
Plasmid mCherry-Lifeact-7 (Addgene plasmid # 54491)
were gifts from Michael Davidson.
siRNA/plasmids were transfected for 48/24 h using Li-
pofectamine/RNAiMAX or Lipofectamine/plus reagents
(Invitrogen). CHO cells were serum starved (2 h),
washed and seeded on fibrinogen-coated (50 μg mL−1)
glass coverslips. Drugs were added 30 min to 2 h after
seeding. For MLN8237 (400 nM)-induced polyploidiza-
tion, cells were treated 24–48 h prior to transfection and
until the end of the experiment. SiR Tubulin was applied
on cells overnight at 80 nM with 2 μM verapamil, the
day before spreading cells on fibrinogen.
Cell fixation, immunofluorescence microscopy, live cell
imaging, quantification
Cells and megakaryocytes were fixed with 4% parafor-
maldehyde in PEM (0.1 mM PIPES, pH 6.9; 1 mM

(to

Cells
were
mounted in Mowiol with anti-fading N-propyl gallate.
Fixed cells were observed with wide field or confocal
microscope as indicated.
Wide field fluorescence microscopy was performed
using a Zeiss AxioimagerZ1 microscope. Mosaic images
were acquired with a Zeiss 40x EC Plan-NEOFLUAR 1.3
oil DIC or Zeiss 20× Plan Apochromat 0.8 and an Andor
Zyla 4.2 sCMOS camera. To increase sampling size, 20
to 50 fields of each experimental condition were ana-
lyzed. Images were segmented using an intensity thresh-
old in ImageJ software. Unresolved clusters of cells were
discarded. Cell Ac-Tub and total tubulin staining mean
intensities were calculated, and cell elongation was mon-
itored using the shape descriptors such as aspect ratio
(AR; ratio of major to minor cell axis lengths), cell per-
imeter, and area. Values were entered in a prism soft-
ware
to
calculate
Ac-Tub/tubulin
ratio,
AR
and
perimeter, SEM and p values.
Confocal microscopy was performed using a Leica SP8
confocal microscope equipped with a Leica 63x HCX PL
APO 1.4 oil CS2 objective. Most images are maximal in-
tensity projections (MIP) of 3D Z stacks. Sometimes,
single planes are shown as indicated.
For modulation contrast time-lapse microscopy, im-
ages were recorded using either an inverted Leica
DMIRE2 microscope, a 20X N PLAN L 0.4 LMC (Leica
Modulation Contrast) objective and a Princeton Instru-
ments Micromax YHS1300 CCD camera or an Olympus
IX83 microscope, a 20x LUCPLFLN 0.45 RC2 (Olympus

acquired using the easy3D SLM module.
Electron microscopy
D723H cells spread on fibrinogen-coated cover slips were
prepared for scanning electron microscopy to study their
surface by fixation for an hour in 2,5% glutaraldehyde in
PHEM buffer, pH 7.2 for an hour at room temperature.
To examine cytoskeletons, cells were permeabilized as de-
scribed in [6] prior to fixation, then washed in PHEM buf-
fer. Fixed samples were dehydrated using a graded ethanol
series (30–100%), followed by 10 min in graded ethanol–
hexamethyldisilazane,
and
then
hexamethyldisilazane
alone. Subsequently, the samples were sputter coated with
an approximative 10-nm-thick gold film and then exam-
ined under a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi
S4000, at CoMET, MRI-RIO Imaging, Biocampus, INM
Montpellier France) using a lens detector with an acceler-
ation voltage of 10 KV at calibrated magnifications.
For transmission electron microscopy, cells were fixed
for an hour in 2,5% glutaraldehyde in a PHEM buffer
(1X, pH 7.2) overnight at 4 °C and post-fixed in a 0.5%
osmic acid for 2 h at dark and room temperature, dehy-
drated in a graded series of ethanol solutions (30–100%),
and embedded in EmBed 812 using an Automated
Microwave Tissue Processor for Electronic Microscopy,
Leica EM AMW. Thin sections (70 nm; Leica-Reichert
Ultracut E) collected at different levels of each block
were counterstained with uranyl acetate 1.5% in 70%
ethanol and lead citrate and observed using a Tecnai
F20 transmission electron microscope at 200 KV in the
CoMET MRI facilities, INM, Montpellier France.
Statistical analysis
All experiments described in the manuscript were at least
performed three times unless otherwise mentioned. Data
were analyzed with Prism5 for MacOS X. Data were ana-
lyzed using unpaired, two-tailed t tests. ***P < 0.0001 was
considered statistically significant. The values are presented
as the means, and error bars represent the standard error of
the mean (SEM). Raw data are provided in Additional file 16.
