Abstract. Ice growth processes within clouds affect the type
and amount of precipitation. Hence, the importance of an
accurate representation of ice microphysics in numerical
weather and numerical climate models has been conﬁrmed
by several studies. To better constrain ice processes in mod-
els, we need to study ice cloud regions before and during
monitored precipitation events. For this purpose, two radar
instruments facing each other were used to collect comple-
mentary measurements. The C-band POLDIRAD weather
radar from the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Oberp-
faffenhofen and the Ka-band MIRA-35 cloud radar from
the Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich (LMU) were
used to monitor stratiform precipitation in the vertical cross-
sectional area between the two instruments. The logarithmic
difference of radar reﬂectivities at two different wavelengths
(54.5 and 8.5 mm), known as the dual-wavelength ratio, was
exploited to provide information about the size of the de-
tected ice hydrometeors, taking advantage of the different
scattering behavior in the Rayleigh and Mie regime. Along
with the dual-wavelength ratio, differential radar reﬂectivity
measurements from POLDIRAD provided information about
the apparent shape of the detected ice hydrometeors. Scatter-
ing simulations using the T-matrix method were performed
for oblate and horizontally aligned prolate ice spheroids of
varying shape and size using a realistic particle size distribu-
tion and a well-established mass–size relationship. The com-
bination of dual-wavelength ratio, radar reﬂectivity, and dif-
ferential radar reﬂectivity measurements as well as scattering
simulations was used for the development of a novel retrieval
for ice cloud microphysics. The development of the retrieval
scheme also comprised a method to estimate the hydrom-
eteor attenuation in both radar bands. To demonstrate this
approach, a feasibility study was conducted on three strati-
form snow events which were monitored over Munich in Jan-
uary 2019. The ice retrieval can provide ice particle shape,
size, and mass information which is in line with differential
radar reﬂectivity, dual-wavelength ratio, and radar reﬂectiv-
ity observations, respectively, when the ice spheroids are as-
sumed to be oblates and to follow the mass–size relation of
aggregates. When combining two spatially separated radars
to retrieve ice microphysics, the beam width mismatch can
locally lead to signiﬁcant uncertainties. However, the cali-
bration uncertainty is found to cause the largest bias for the
averaged retrieved size and mass. Moreover, the shape as-
sumption is found to be equally important to the calibration
uncertainty for the retrieved size, while it is less important
than the calibration uncertainty for the retrieval of ice mass.
A further ﬁnding is the importance of the differential radar
reﬂectivity for the particle size retrieval directly above the
MIRA-35 cloud radar. Especially for that observation geom-
etry, the simultaneous slantwise observation from the polari-
metric weather radar POLDIRAD can reduce ambiguities in
retrieval of the ice particle size by constraining the ice parti-
cle shape.

Introduction
The ice phase is the predominant cloud phase at middle and
higher latitudes (Field and Heymsﬁeld, 2015). Ice clouds are
known to reﬂect the shortwave incoming solar radiation, but

they can also trap the longwave terrestrial radiation, interfer-
ing with the Earth’s energy budget (Liou, 1986). Their inﬂu-
ence on the radiation budget of the climate system strongly
depends on their top height as well as on ice crystal habits
and effective ice crystal size (Zhang et al., 2002). Ice growth
processes such as deposition, riming, and aggregation play a
leading role in the formation of precipitation and are a cen-
tral topic in many ice cloud studies. A misrepresentation of
these processes in numerical weather models can lead to high
uncertainties, and therefore they need to be constrained as ac-
curately as possible. Brdar and Seifert (2018) presented the
novel Monte Carlo microphysical model, McSnow, aiming
for a better representation of aggregation and riming pro-
cesses of ice particles. When numerical weather models are
used to predict microphysics information about ice hydrom-
eteors (e.g., Predicted Particle Properties – P3, Morrison and
Milbrandt, 2015), we need to investigate under which con-
ditions each ice growth process occurs. To better understand
these mechanisms and improve their representation in mod-
els, more precise microphysics information (e.g., size, shape,
and mass) through ice retrievals based on measurements is
needed.
Many studies showed how millimeter-wave radar mea-
surements can be used to retrieve ice water content (IWC)
proﬁles in clouds (e.g., Hogan et al., 2006). However, stand-
alone single-frequency radar measurements cannot constrain
microphysical properties such as ice particle size and shape
simultaneously without using empirical relations. To deal
with more parameters (e.g., IWC, size, and shape) more
measurements are needed. Thus, observations or simulated
radar parameters are often combined with other remote sens-
ing instruments, e.g., with lidars, to retrieve microphysics
properties such as the effective radius of cloud ice particles
(Cazenave et al., 2019) or with infrared radiometers (Ma-
trosov et al., 1994) to retrieve the median diameter of the
ice particle size distribution. Another way to gain micro-
physics information is to use multi-frequency radar obser-
vations (described in detail in Sect. 1.1) as they exploit the
scattering properties of ice particles in both the Rayleigh and
non-Rayleigh regime. To this end, frequencies are chosen
with respect to the prevalent ice particle size. In the case of
dual-frequency techniques, one frequency is chosen to be in
the Rayleigh regime (e.g., S, C, or X band), wherein parti-
cle size is much smaller than the radar wavelength, and the
other is chosen to be in the Mie regime (e.g., Ka, Ku, or W
band), wherein particle size is comparable or larger than the
radar wavelength (e.g., Matrosov, 1998; Hogan et al., 2000,
and many more). The scattering of radar waves is sensitive
to the size and number concentration of particles. The radar
reﬂectivity factor z is deﬁned as the sixth moment of the par-
ticle size distribution N(D) and is thus designed to be pro-
portional to the Rayleigh scattering cross-section of small –
with a size much smaller compared to the radar wavelength
– liquid spheres:
z[mm6 m−3] =
∞
Z
0
N(D)D6dD,
(1a)
where z is the radar reﬂectivity in linear scale, N(D) the
number concentration, and D the geometric diameter of the
particles.
This formula can be also expressed in logarithmic terms:
Z [dBZ] = 10log10(z).
(1b)
This deﬁnition, however, cannot be directly applied to snow
due to the varying density, irregular shape, and larger size
of ice particles, which cause deviations from the Rayleigh
into the Mie scattering regime. Moreover, N(D) for ice par-
ticles refers to the size distribution of their melted diameters.
Nevertheless, an equivalent radar reﬂectivity factor Ze can be
derived from the measured radar reﬂectivity η (η = P
Volσn;
normalized to a speciﬁc volume summation of backscatter-
ing cross-section, σn, of all detected hydrometeors) when the
dielectric factor of water |K|2 = 0.93 is assumed:
ze [mm6 m−3] = η
λ4
π5|K|2 and
Ze [dBZ] = 10log10(ze),
(1c)
where λ is the radar wavelength. In the Rayleigh regime, the
radar reﬂectivity factor Z or the equivalent radar reﬂectivity
factor Ze (for simplicity also referred to as radar reﬂectivity
in this paper) is proportional to the sixth power of the parti-
cle size, while in the Mie regime Ze scales with the second
power of the particle size. In both regimes Ze scales linearly
with the particle number concentration.
1.1
Size and shape microphysics retrievals
Using the ratio of radar reﬂectivities at two different radar
wavelengths (Eq. 2; dual-wavelength ratio, DWR), we can
infer size information about hydrometeors observed within
the radar beams. This parameter increases with the particle
size when the shorter radar wavelength is equal to or shorter
than the particle size:
DWRλ1,λ2 [dB] = 10log10
ze,λ1
ze,λ2

or
DWRλ1,λ2 [dB] = Ze,λ1 [dBZ] −Ze,λ2 [dBZ].
(2)
In Eq. (2), λ1 > λ2 represents the two radar wavelengths,
ze,λ1 and ze,λ2 the radar reﬂectivities at the two radar wave-
lengths in linear scale (units: mm6 m−3), and Ze,λ1 and Ze,λ2
the radar reﬂectivities in logarithmic scale (units: dBZ). Re-
cent studies (e.g., Trömel et al., 2021) have underlined that
multi-wavelength (also known as multi-frequency) measure-
ments should be combined with other types of radar observa-
tions, e.g., polarimetric variables or Doppler velocity, to im-
prove our understanding of ice microphysics. For ice particle

density in particular, DWR provides only limited informa-
tion, while Doppler velocity measurements can better con-
strain the particle density as the fall speed is strongly con-
nected to it. Speciﬁcally, Mason et al. (2018) used vertically
pointing Ka- and W-band cloud radars to combine DWR and
Doppler measurements to provide information about the par-
ticle size distribution (PSD) and an ice particle’s density fac-
tor, which is connected to ice particle shape and mass, but
also terminal velocity and backscatter cross-section. How-
ever, the DWR approach has been widely used in many stud-
ies in the past, providing microphysics information with-
out Doppler velocity measurements. In particular, the DWR
method has been used in ice studies to estimate the snowfall
rate R or for the quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE).
Matrosov (1998) developed a DWR method to estimate R,
supplementing experimental Ze-R relations with a retrieved
median size. In other studies, such as Hogan and Illingworth
(1999) and Hogan et al. (2000), DWR from airborne and
ground-based radars was used to obtain information about
ice crystal sizes and IWC for cirrus clouds. In recent years,
the combination of multiple DWR measurements has been
explored to provide more microphysics information, e.g., ice
particle habits or density. Kneifel et al. (2015) developed a
triple-frequency method (DWRX,Ka and DWRKa,W) to de-
rive ice particle habit information from three snowfall events
measured during the Biogenic Aerosols Effects on Clouds
and Climate (BAECC) ﬁeld campaign (Petäjä et al., 2016).
The triple-frequency method was also used by Leinonen et
al. (2018b) to develop an algorithm that retrieves ice particle
size and density as well as number concentration using air-
borne radar data from the Olympic Mountains Experiment
(OLYMPEX, Houze et al., 2017). In Mason et al. (2019), the
PSD and morphology of ice particles were thoroughly ex-
plored using the triple-frequency method to improve ice par-
ticle parameterizations in numerical weather prediction mod-
els. In the same study, it was also found that for heavily rimed
ice particles, the triple-frequency radar observations can con-
strain the shape parameter µ of the PSD. Recently, Mroz
et al. (2021) used single-frequency measurements (X band),
triple-frequency radar measurements (X, Ka, W band), and
triple-frequency combined with Doppler velocity radar mea-
surements to develop different versions of an algorithm that
retrieves the mean mass-weighted particle size, IWC, and the
degree of riming. The multi-frequency versions of the algo-
rithm retrieved IWC with lower uncertainties compared to
the single-frequency version. Additionally, with the multi-
frequency approaches, the algorithm was also able to provide
ice particle density information and mean mass-weighted di-
ameter information for larger snowﬂakes in contrast to the
single-frequency approach, which could only constrain the
mean mass-weighted diameter for snowﬂakes up to 3 mm
size. Overall, the multi-frequency versions of the algorithm
performed better, as the retrieved parameters agreed better
with in situ measurements.
Beyond multi-frequency techniques, ice microphysics in-
formation can be obtained from polarimetric radar measure-
ments. In previous studies, polarimetry was commonly used
for snowfall rate estimation. Bukovˇci´c et al. (2018), for in-
stance, used polarimetric radar variables to study the IWC
and the resulting snow water equivalent rate. Besides these
precipitation rate studies, polarimetry is an advantageous
tool to obtain information about the size distribution and the
shape of ice particles. Additional characteristics, like the par-
ticle orientation and canting angle distribution, as well as
the variable refractive index of melting or rimed ice crys-
tals, have a further inﬂuence on polarimetric radar signals.
To untangle some of these particle properties, polarimetric
weather radars can provide several parameters such as dif-
ferential radar reﬂectivity (ZDR), linear depolarization ratio
(LDR), reﬂectivity difference (ZDP), cross-correlation coef-
ﬁcient (ρHV), differential propagation phase (ϕDP), and spe-
ciﬁc differential phase (KDP). A description of the aforemen-
tioned polarimetric radar variables can be found in Straka
et al. (2000) and Kumjian (2013). The different sensitivi-
ties of these parameters have been widely used in classiﬁ-
cation schemes of atmospheric hydrometeors. Höller et al.
(1994) developed one of the ﬁrst algorithms to distinguish
between rain, hail, single cells, or multi-cells using ZDR,
LDR, KDP, and ρHV measurements during the evolution of
a thunderstorm while moving from the west towards southern
Germany. Subsequently, this algorithm was extended to esti-
mate hydrometeor mass concentrations (Höller, 1995). Later,
Straka et al. (2000) summarized the characteristics of differ-
ent hydrometeor types depending on their radar signatures
at a wavelength of 10 cm. One prominent polarimetric pa-
rameter in ice microphysics studies is known to be ZDR, a
parameter which is deﬁned as
ZDR[dB] = 10log10
zH
zV

,
(3)
where zH is the signal received or reﬂectivity factor at hor-
izontal polarization, and zV is the signal received or reﬂec-
tivity factor at vertical polarization. Following the deﬁnition
of ZDR, it is zero if the received signal in both polarization
states is the same, i.e., for spherical targets. For elongated,
azimuthally oriented particles ZDR is found to be greater
(oblate particles) or less than zero (vertically aligned pro-
lates), depending on the orientation of the rotational axis to
the horizontal polarization state (e.g., Straka et al., 2000).
In Moisseev et al. (2015), ZDR along with KDP has been
used to investigate growth processes of snow and the signa-
tures on dual-polarization and Doppler velocity radar obser-
vations. Later on, Tiira and Moisseev (2020) exploited ver-
tical proﬁles of ZDR combined with KDP and Ze for the
development of an unsupervised classiﬁcation of snow and
ice crystal particles. In that study, the most important growth
processes of ice particles were studied using several years of
Ikaalinen C-band radar data from the Hyytiälä forestry sta-
tion in Juupajoki, Finland.

E. Tetoni et al.: Synergy of multi-wavelength and polarimetric radar measurements
Although the size of atmospheric hydrometeors is strongly
correlated with DWR, many studies have shown that DWR
is also sensitive to the shape of ice hydrometeors. This sen-
sitivity of DWR to shape was shown in, e.g., Matrosov et
al. (2005), wherein the authors estimated the increased un-
certainty in particle size retrievals when the particles are as-
sumed to be spherical only. One solution to that problem
was offered by Matrosov et al. (2019), who stated that the
shape of ice hydrometeors can be disentangled from DWR
by studying the effect of radar elevation angle on DWR. Non-
spherical ice hydrometeors should show a strong inﬂuence of
elevation angle on DWR compared to spherical ice particles.
Besides this scanning approach, the combination with po-
larimetry from collocated or nearby radar instruments could
offer a promising solution to disentangle the contribution of
size and shape in DWR measurements. While the shape can
be constrained by ZDR measurements, the size of the de-
tected particles can be determined using DWR.
1.2
Representation of ice atmospheric hydrometeors
using spheroids
Single-scattering simulations are an indispensable tool to
bridge the gap between microphysical properties of hydrom-
eteors and polarimetric radar observations. In the case of ice
particles, the calculation of scattering properties can be chal-
lenging due to their large complexity and variety in shape,
structure, size, and density. One of the most sophisticated
methods, the discrete-dipole approximation (DDA; Draine
and Flatau, 1994), can be used to calculate the scattering
properties of realistic ice crystals and aggregates. However,
this approximation can be computationally demanding. To
reduce computation cost and complexity, ice particles are
often assumed to be spheres and their scattering properties
are calculated using the Mie theory, or they are assumed to
be spheroids and their scattering properties are calculated
using the T-matrix method (Waterman, 1965) or the self-
similar Rayleigh–Gans approximation (SSRGA; e.g., Hogan
and Westbrook, 2014; Hogan et al., 2017; Leinonen et al.,
2018a). The SSRGA was developed to consider the distri-
bution of the ice mass throughout the particle’s volume in
scattering simulations. As we aim for a simple ice parti-
cle model, we extensively used the T-matrix method in this
study, assuming the ice particles to be soft spheroids. It is
a common approach in model studies that ice particles are
represented by homogeneous spheroids with density equal
to or smaller than bulk ice. Due to its simplicity, the limita-
tions of the spheroid approximation have been a heavily re-
searched and debated topic in the last decade. While Tyynelä
et al. (2011) showed an underestimation of the backscat-
tering for large snowﬂakes, Hogan et al. (2012) suggested
that horizontally aligned oblate spheroids with a sphericity
(S; minor to major axis ratio) of 0.6 can reliably reproduce
the scattering properties of realistic ice aggregates which are
smaller than the radar wavelength. The same study also con-
cluded that spheroids are more suitable to represent larger
particles (maximum diameter up to 2.5 mm) in simulations
rather than Mie spheres, as the latter can lead to a strong
overestimation of Ze. Leinonen et al. (2012), on the other
hand, showed that the spheroidal model cannot always ex-
plain the radar measurements as more sophisticated parti-
cle models can, e.g., snowﬂake models. Later on, Hogan
and Westbrook (2014) indicated that the soft spheroid ap-
proximation underestimates the backscattered signal of large
snowﬂakes (1 cm size) – measured with a 94 GHz radar – by
up to 40 and 100 times for vertical and horizontal incidence,
respectively. In contrast, the simple spheroidal particle model
could successfully explain measurements of slant-45◦lin-
ear depolarization ratio, SLDR, and SLDR patterns at ele-
vation angles (Matrosov, 2015) during the Storm Peak Labo-
ratory Cloud Property Validation Experiment (StormVEx).
In Liao et al. (2016) it was found that randomly oriented
oblate ice spheroids could reproduce scattering properties
in the Ku and Ka band similar to those from scattering
databases when large particles were assumed to have a den-
sity of 0.2 gcm−3 and a maximum size up to 6 mm. Al-
though Schrom and Kumjian (2018) showed that homoge-
neous reduced-density ice spheroids or plates cannot gen-
erally represent the scattering properties of branched pla-
nar crystals, the simple spheroidal model has been used in
recent studies to represent ice aggregates as in Jiang et al.
(2019), to simulate DWR for snow rate estimation studies as
in Huang et al. (2019), and to retrieve shape from LDR as in
Matrosov (2020). In all these studies, it is recognized that the
spheroidal model requires fewer assumed parameters com-
pared to more complex particle models.
Although more complex ice particle and scattering mod-
els are available, this work will use the soft spheroid approx-
imation for the following reasons: (1) in this work we aim
to provide a feasibility study to combine two spatially sepa-
rated radars to better constrain the ice crystal shape in micro-
physical retrievals using simultaneous DWR and ZDR ob-
servations from an oblique angle. Besides instrument coordi-
nation, the actual measurements and the assessment of mea-
surement errors, the ice crystals, and the scattering model are
just one component. Due to its simple and versatile setup, this
work will utilize the soft spheroid approximation to study the
beneﬁt of additional ZDR measurements and the role of the
observation geometry. (2) More importantly, to our knowl-
edge, the more accurate SSRGA described by Hogan and
Westbrook (2014) does not (yet) provide polarimetric vari-
ables used in this study, namely the ZDR. (3) In anticipa-
tion of a prognostic aspect ratio of ice crystals in bulk mi-
crophysical models (e.g., the adaptive habit prediction; Har-
rington et al., 2013), we aim to keep a minimal set of degrees
of freedom to remain comparable with these modeling ef-
forts. (4) Using ice spheroids, we are able to vary parameters
such as median size, aspect ratio, and ice water content in-
dependently, which serve as degrees of freedom of the ice
spheroids, and calculate their scattering properties without

much computational cost as in other scattering algorithms
(e.g., DDA) that are used in more realistic ice crystal shape
simulations. Due to the independent parameters describing a
spheroid, we can better study the dependence between each
variable and the forward-simulated radar variables.
Due to this simpliﬁcation, this study will focus on the fea-
sibility of combining DWR and ZDR from spatially sepa-
rated radar instruments into a common retrieval framework.
Due to the missing internal structure and the near-ﬁeld ice
dipole interactions of soft spheroids, the known underesti-
mation of the radar backscatter and generally lower ZDR for
larger snowﬂakes will limit this study to ice aggregates with
sizes in the millimeter regime. This will include the onset of
ice aggregation within clouds above the melting layer (ML)
but will exclude heavy snowfall close to the ground. How-
ever, this region is rarely included in the measurement region
with an overlap between the two scanning radar instruments.
1.3
Scientiﬁc objective and outline of this study
Although vertically pointing radars are useful for Doppler
spectra observations (e.g., Kneifel et al., 2016; Kalesse et al.,
2016), they cannot provide slantwise polarimetric measure-
ments of ZDR, which can be useful to estimate the shape
of the ice particles, due to their observation geometry. In
this study we want to investigate the feasibility of combin-
ing two spatially separated radars to derive observations of
DWR and ZDR for size, shape, and mass retrievals of ice
cloud particles and aggregates detected above the ML. In the
scope of the priority program “Fusion of Radar Polarime-
try and Numerical Atmospheric Modelling Towards an Im-
proved Understanding of Cloud and Precipitation Processes”
(PROM; Trömel et al., 2021), funded by the German Re-
search Foundation (DFG), we explore the added value when
operational weather radars are augmented with cloud radar
measurements. By using ZDR measurements from a polari-
metric weather radar, we estimate the shape of the ice hy-
drometeors. To estimate particle size, we use simultaneous
range-height indicator (RHI) scans from a scanning cloud
radar, 23 km away from the weather radar, to obtain dual-
wavelength observations for the same observation volume.
As we aim to use DWR and ZDR measurements from two
different locations, we are focused on case studies with ho-
mogeneous cloud scenes and in which hydrometeor attenu-
ation can be considered negligible. Therefore, we selected
cloud cross-sections of cloud scenes with stratiform snow-
fall wherein water hydrometeors are unlikely to occur. To
exclude liquid hydrometeors and melting layers, an ice mask
was developed and applied to the observational dataset. Fu-
ture studies will also include wet particles to improve the
representation of melting and riming processes in numerical
weather models. Combining ice-scattering simulations and
radar measurements, we present an ice microphysics retrieval
that resolves the ice water content, the median size, and the
apparent shape of the detected ice particles. The apparent
shape (for simplicity, the term “shape” will be used through-
out this study) is described by the average observed aspect
ratio, which is strongly connected to the orientation of ice
particles including their ﬂutter around this preferential orien-
tation. Our approach considers single RHI scans from each
radar instrument, resulting in a single radar cross-section.
In the special case when the wind direction in this area is
aligned to our radar cross-section, we can monitor the evolu-
tion of precipitation and the development of fall streaks in-
side the clouds by performing continuous RHI scans accord-
ing to the precipitation rate. In another approach, to deeply
investigate the initiation of convection as well as to better
observe ice microphysical processes in clouds, we used a
sector range-height indicator (S-RHI) with POLDIRAD and
MIRA-35 to monitor precipitation cells during convection.
In this way, a ﬁrst scan was executed towards the cell of in-
terest at a speciﬁc azimuth. Then, two additional fast RHI
scans were executed from each radar deviated ±2◦from the
initial azimuth. This approach can result in nine vertical pro-
ﬁles within the precipitation cell, providing additional micro-
physical information (Köcher et al., 2022, their Fig. 1).
Our approach of combining two radars located at differ-
ent areas has multiple advantages. First of all, we can ex-
ploit the non-Rayleigh scattering, which usually complicates
Ze-only retrievals, by using the DWR to constrain the size
of the atmospheric hydrometeors. DWR has been used so
far in many conventional retrievals to retrieve particle size
– usually by making an a priori assumption of the ice par-
ticle shape, e.g., the aspect ratio. In our approach, we aug-
ment this technique with polarimetric measurements (e.g.,
ZDR). Especially when the other scanning radar is point-
ing upwards, ZDR creates added value when obtained from a
second scanning radar. For the multi-wavelength technique,
oblate ice particles appear like spheres when it is applied
to vertically pointing radars. In this study we advocate that
spatially separated radars are suited to provide this kind of
measurement. Operational weather radars located throughout
Germany could therefore be used in synergy with already es-
tablished cloud radar sites to monitor precipitation but also
to obtain microphysical properties of atmospheric hydrome-
teors.
This paper is organized as follows: in Sect. 2 the in-
struments used to produce the measurement dataset are de-
scribed. In Sect. 3 the measurement strategy and the error
assessments of the radar observations as well as the T-matrix
scattering simulations are presented in detail. Section 3 also
demonstrates the methodology of combining DWR and po-
larimetric measurements along with the scattering simula-
tions in order to retrieve microphysical properties of ice par-
ticles. In addition, the attenuation correction methods are de-
scribed. In Sect. 4, retrieval results along with their uncer-
tainties as well as statistical results of the ice microphysics
retrieval are presented. Furthermore, limitations of this study,
comparisons to other methods, and the performance of the
ice retrieval in different areas of the radar cross-section are

Instruments
This feasibility study to combine two spatially separated
weather and cloud radars was conducted in the scope of the
IcePolCKa project (Investigation of the initiation of convec-
tion and the evolution of precipitation using simulations and
polarimetric radar observations at C- and Ka-band), which is
part of the PROM priority program (Trömel et al., 2021). For
the DWR dataset the synergy of two polarimetric radars, the
C-band POLDIRAD weather radar at the German Aerospace
Center (DLR) in Oberpfaffenhofen and the Ka-band MIRA-
35 cloud radar at Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich
(LMU) was used. POLDIRAD and MIRA-35 performed co-
ordinated RHI scans towards each other (azimuth angle con-
stant for both radars) at a distance of 23 km between DLR
and LMU, monitoring stratiform precipitation events.

5.504 GHz (λ = 54.5 mm, λ1 in Eq. 2). The radar is located
at DLR, Oberpfaffenhofen, 23 km southwest of Munich at
48◦05′12′′ N and 11◦16′45′′ E at an altitude of 602.5 m above
mean sea level (m a.m.s.l.). Since 1986, POLDIRAD has
been operated on the roof of the Institute of Atmospheric
Physics (IPA) for meteorological research purposes (Schroth
et al., 1988). The weather radar consists of a parabolic an-
tenna with a diameter of 4.5 m and a circular beam width of
1◦. A magnetron transmitter with a power peak of 400 kW
and a Selex ES Germatronik GDRX digital receiver with
both linear and logarithmic response are synchronized with
the polarization network of the receiver, which can record the
linear, elliptic, and circular polarization of each radar pulse
(Reimann and Hagen, 2016). POLDIRAD has the capability
to receive the co- and cross-polar components of the hor-
izontal, vertical, circular, and elliptical polarized transmit-
ted electromagnetic waves. In this way it provides several
polarimetric variables, e.g., ZDR and ρHV, which can be
used to obtain additional information about the size, shape,
phase, and falling behavior of the hydrometeors in the at-
mosphere (Straka et al., 2000; Steinert and Chandra, 2009).
Depending on its operational mode, the maximum range that
can be reached is 300 km (for a pulse repetition frequency
of 400 Hz, a pulse duration of 2 µs, and a range resolution
of 300 m), making it a suitable instrument for nowcasting
in the surrounding area of Munich. For the present study
POLDIRAD’s maximum range was 130 km with a pulse rep-
etition frequency of 1150 Hz, a pulse duration of 1 µs, and
a range resolution of 150 m. The system can also be oper-
ated in the STAR mode (simultaneous transmission and re-

ception). Here, we used the alternate-HV mode (alternate
horizontally and vertically polarized transmitted electromag-
netic waves), which allows measuring the cross-polar com-
ponents of the backscatter matrix. The elevation velocity dur-
ing the RHI scans was 1◦s−1. The technical characteristics of
POLDIRAD are presented in Table 1.

MIRA-35
MIRA-35 (Fig. 1, right) is a Ka-band scanning Doppler cloud
radar developed by Metek (Meteorologische Messtech-
nik GmbH, Elmshorn, Germany) with a frequency of ca.
35.2 GHz and a wavelength λ = 8.5 mm (Görsdorf et al.,
2015), which is λ2 in Eq. (2). The cloud radar, which is
operated by the Meteorological Institute Munich (MIM) as
part of the Munich Aerosol Cloud Scanner (MACS) project
(also referred to as miraMACS, Ewald et al., 2019), is located
on the roof of the institute at the LMU at 48◦08′52.2′′ N,
11◦34′24.2′′ E and 541 m a.m.s.l. The transmitter consists of
a magnetron with a power peak of 30 kW, which typically
transmits radar pulses of 0.2 µs with a pulse repetition fre-
quency of 5 kHz, corresponding to a range resolution of
30 m. The 1 m diameter antenna dish produces a beam width
of 0.6◦. The MIRA-35 cloud radar emits horizontally po-
larized radiation and measures both vertical and horizontal
components of the backscattered wave. Hence, it has the ca-
pability to perform LDR measurements. The cloud radar usu-
ally points to the zenith but can also perform RHI scans at
different azimuths with an elevation velocity of 4◦s−1 and
plan-position indicator (PPI) scans at different elevation an-
gles. The technical characteristics of MIRA-35 are presented
in Table 1.

Methods
This study intends to investigate the synergy of two spatially
separated radars to retrieve microphysical properties of ice
hydrometeors detected in clouds that are known to affect the
type of precipitation (e.g., stratiform or convective), aiming
to improve their representation in numerical weather mod-
els. To address this, an ice microphysics retrieval scheme has
been developed. In this way, the microphysical properties of

ice hydrometeors are revealed for stratiform snow precipita-
tion cases. In this section, our approach is presented in detail
and demonstrated using a case study example from 30 Jan-
uary 2019 when a snowfall event took place over the Munich
area. At 04:00 UTC of that night, an ice cloud started form-
ing at an altitude of 9 km. During the time of our coordinated
measurements the cloud’s vertical extension was up to 7 km.
Throughout that day, the ambient temperature was mostly be-
low 0 ◦C. The wind speed at the surface was very low, while
at higher altitudes it exceeded 15 ms−1 in some cases. The
vertical gradient of the wind favored the development of fall
streaks (also shown in our radar observations in Fig. 3) and
thus ice particle growth within the ice cloud.
3.1
Measurement strategy and data preprocessing
Coordinated RHI measurements with POLDIRAD and
MIRA-35 have been collected during three snowfall days on
9, 10, and 30 January 2019, with some ice particles reaching
the ground where both radars are located (602.5 m a.m.s.l.
for POLDIRAD and 541 m a.m.s.l. for MIRA-35). However,
only ice particles above the melting layer were investigated
in the present study. A total of 59 RHI scans were executed
from the two radars at almost the same time (time differ-
ence between RHIs was estimated as less than 15 s) with
a temporal resolution which was adjusted to the precipita-
tion rate. POLDIRAD scanned between 0 and 35◦eleva-
tion towards MIRA-35 (northeast direction, azimuth of 73◦),
while MIRA-35 scanned between 0 and 90◦elevation to-
wards POLDIRAD (southwest direction, azimuth of 253◦)
as well as 90–169◦elevation in a backward northeast di-
rection but still inside the common cross-section (Fig. 2).
With this setup, the cross-section between the two radars
and beyond the MIRA-35 position was fully covered to
record the development and microphysics of precipitation
cells and fall streaks. During the snow events, Ze measure-
ments from the two radars were performed and interpo-
lated, using the nearest-neighbor interpolation method, onto
a common rectangular grid (50m × 50 m). The 0-height of
this grid is deﬁned to be the height above mean sea level,
while POLDIRAD and MIRA-35 are located at 602.5 and
541 m a.m.s.l. In Fig. 3a and c, the measured Ze from the two
radar systems during the RHI scans from 30 January 2019 at
10:08 UTC is presented. For the MIRA-35 Ze measurements
we applied a calibration offset of 4 dBZ as derived in Ewald
et al. (2019). Studying only snow cases, no strong effects of
hydrometeor attenuation are expected (e.g., Nishikawa et al.,
2016). However, an iterative method to estimate hydrome-
teor attenuation has been developed. Additionally, both Ze
datasets are corrected for gaseous attenuation using the ITU-
R P.676-12 formulas provided by the International Telecom-
munication Union (ITU) in August 2019 (ITU-R P.676-12,
2019). Both methods are fully described in Sect. 3.3. After
the interpolation of both radar reﬂectivities in the common
radar grid, we calculated the DWR (Fig. 3b) using Eq. (2).
Since DWR is deﬁned as the ratio of Ze at two wavelengths,
it is independent of number concentration N. Therefore, it
exploits the difference in the received radar signal due to Mie
effects to give size information. To avoid unwanted biases
by measurement artifacts, DWR values lower than −5 dB
and higher than 20 dB were excluded. Furthermore, errors
from other sources, e.g., beam width mismatch effects (beam
width 1◦for POLDIRAD and 0.6◦for MIRA-35), are con-
sidered (fully explained in Sect. 3.1.2). Besides DWR mea-
surements, polarimetric observations were used to study the
shape of ice particles. POLDIRAD provided polarimetric
measurements of ZDR, but only ZDR values between −1 and
7 dB were considered to be atmospheric hydrometeor signa-
tures. The ZDR calibration was validated using additional
measurements, which are described in detail in Sect. 3.1.2
and Appendix A. For the ZDR panel (Fig. 3d), reasonable
boundaries for optimal visualization purposes were used in
the color map.
When Ze, ZDR, and DWR measurements are combined
(Fig. 3), one can already get a ﬁrst glimpse of the prevalent
ice microphysics. Especially below 3 km of height, between
20 and 30 km from POLDIRAD, the large values of Ze ac-
companied by the large values of DWR (greater than 5 dB)
and the low values of ZDR (lower than 1 dB) indicate the
presence of large and quite spherical ice particles. In the fol-

tively.
lowing, quantitative ice microphysics will be revealed by the
combination of Ze, DWR, and ZDR measurements with scat-
tering simulations for a variety of ice particles.
3.1.1
Application of the ice mask
As already mentioned, the current version of the ice mi-
crophysics retrieval only accounts for ice particles that are
detected in clouds above the ML. Hence, radar datasets
should be ﬁltered accordingly and an ice mask should be ap-
plied. The implementation of the ice mask using a thresh-
old from polarimetric radar variables, i.e., MIRA-35 LDR,
POLDIRAD ZDR, and ρHV, and temperature sounding data
(shown in Fig. 4) are fully presented in Appendix B.
3.1.2
Assessment of radar observation errors
Radar measurements are often affected by systematic or ran-
dom errors. To assess their impact on the ice microphysics
retrieval developed in this study we need to investigate possi-
ble errors in POLDIRAD and MIRA-35 observations as well
as all their sources.
The absolute radiometric calibration of both instruments is
an important error source in DWR measurements. While the
error of the absolute radiometric calibration of POLDIRAD
is estimated to be ±0.5 dB following the validation with an
external device (Reimann, 2013), the budget laboratory cal-
ibration of MIRA-35 following Ewald et al. (2019) is esti-
mated to be ±1.0 dB.
In order to test for a systematic ZDR bias, we exploited
POLDIRAD measurements during vertically pointing scans
(also known as birdbath scans, e.g., Gorgucci et al., 1999) in
a liquid cloud layer performed on 4 April 2019. The measure-
ments indicated that ZDR has an offset of about +0.15 dB as
ZDR values are expected to be near 0 dB for this case due
to the apparent spherical shape of liquid droplets. Although
the examined calibration study from 4 April 2019 was con-
ducted 3 months later, we consider this ZDR offset to be reli-
able since calibration efforts showed similar values over the
past years. Recent studies (Ryzhkov et al., 2005; Frech and
Hubbert, 2020; Ferrone and Berne, 2021) conﬁrm the stabil-
ity of ZDR offsets for even longer time periods as long as
the integrity of the antenna is maintained and wet radome
effects are avoided. In Fig. A1 (Appendix A), examples of
radar reﬂectivity Ze, differential reﬂectivity ZDR, and a scat-
ter plot showing the average ZDR offset are presented. The
scatters in the last panel (Fig. A1c) indicate the median ZDR
value averaged over the full measurement period, shown in
Fig. A1a, for each vertical radar bin within the cloud layer.
The data were acquired by super-sampling the 150 m pulse in
75 m range steps to enhance the signal statistics. To further
ensure the stability of ZDR bias, an additional calibration
validation was conducted following the Ryzhkov and Zrnic
(2019) approach (described in their Sect. 6.2.4). Our mea-
surement dataset from January 2019 was ﬁltered for large
Ze regions and intermediate temperatures for dry and large
aggregates. This analysis yielded a median ZDR = 0.2 dB
for these areas where ice aggregates are expected, indicat-
ing that POLDIRAD was well calibrated during the period
of this study.
Another error that should be considered is the random er-
ror, especially for ZDR measurements at low signal levels. To
detect and ﬁlter out regions with high ZDR noise we compare
the local (three range gates) standard deviation ZDRSD with
the local mean ZDRmean. Subsequently, we only include re-
gions where the signal ZDRmean exceeds the noise ZDRSD
by 1 order of magnitude. An example of this approach can
be found in Fig. A2 (Appendix A).
In our case of spatially separated radar instruments, an az-
imuthal misalignment between the two instruments had to be
excluded to obtain meaningful DWR measurements. To this
end, we performed several solar scans with both instruments
in spring 2019 to conﬁrm their azimuthal pointing accuracy
(e.g., Reimann and Hagen, 2016). Here, we found an azimuth
offset of −0.2◦for POLDIRAD and an azimuth offset of
+0.1◦for MIRA-35. Consecutive solar scans conﬁrmed the
azimuthal pointing accuracy within ±0.1◦. Despite the small
azimuthal misalignment, the radar beam centroids of both
instruments were clearly within the respective other beam
width during our measurement period in 2019.
Besides an azimuthal misalignment, we also analyzed the
temporal mismatch between the RHIs as well as the volu-
metric mismatch in the context of nonuniform beam ﬁlling.
Although the RHIs from the radars were scheduled to be
executed simultaneously, regions within the RHIs are mea-
sured at slightly different times by both instruments. This
temporal mismatch can lead to slightly different Ze radar
observations from both radars in the context of horizontal
advection of an inhomogeneous cloud scene. In the follow-
ing we use this temporal mismatch to estimate the result-
ing DWR error for the example case shown in Fig. 3. Us-
ing wind data (Fig. 4) from the Oberschleißheim sounding
station (source: Deutscher Wetterdienst, data provided by
University of Wyoming; http://weather.uwyo.edu/upperair/

temporal mismatch (Fig. 5a) between the radar measure-
ments for each pixel in the common radar grid to a spatial
difference (Fig. 5c). To estimate the impact of this spatiotem-

poral mismatch (hereafter spatiotemporal error) we subse-
quently used these spatial differences to calculate DWR er-
rors between pixels in the spatially higher resolved MIRA-35
Ze measurements (Fig. 5e). Concluding the DWR error as-
sessment, we also analyzed the volumetric mismatch caused
by the different beam widths of the two radars. For spatially
heterogeneous scenes, this volumetric mismatch can lead to
artiﬁcial DWR signatures caused by nonuniform beam ﬁll-
ing. Here, the spatially higher resolved MIRA-35 Ze mea-
surements (30 m range gate length) along the RHI cross-
section were used as a proxy to obtain the spatial heterogene-
ity of Ze perpendicular to the RHI cross-section. In a ﬁrst
step, the local beam diameters for each pixel in the common
grid are calculated for POLDIRAD (Fig. 5b) and MIRA-35
(Fig. 5d). Then, moving averages along the Ze cross-sections
from MIRA-35 are performed using the corresponding local
beam diameters. Hence, at each pixel of the common radar
grid two averaged MIRA-35 Ze values are obtained: one cor-
responding to the local beam diameter of MIRA-35 and one
corresponding to the local beam diameter of POLDIRAD.
Subtracting the averaged Ze for each pixel, we were able
to estimate the error caused by the volumetric mismatch be-
tween the two radar beams (Fig. 5f). We apply the retrieval
to all cloud regions, except for those ﬁltered out by the ice
mask and noise thresholds. The aforementioned errors are
considered during the statistical aggregation of retrieval re-
sults (Sect. 4.2).

Numerical methods
Complementary to measurements, the numerical methods
used in this work are introduced in the following section.
First, an ice crystal model needs to be assumed, which can be
used in a scattering algorithm to simulate the backscattering
of these crystals. On this basis, radar variables can be com-
puted, which can then be compared to radar measurements.
As we intended to retrieve the apparent shape, size, and mass
of the detected ice hydrometeors, we used the aspect ratio
(hereafter referred to as AR), median mass diameter (Dm) of

the PSD, and ice water content as 3 degrees of freedom of the
simulated ice particles for the development of lookup tables
(LUTs). Different LUTs for several angles of radars geome-
try (Fig. 2) were created. Their values were then interpolated
to ﬁt all possible radar viewing geometries and used in the ice
retrieval. The a priori assumptions used in the simulations are
fully described in the following subsections.
3.2.1
Soft spheroid model
For the scattering simulations we assumed that ice hydrom-
eteors can be represented by ice spheroids. These so-called
soft spheroids are assumed to be homogeneous ice particles
composed of an ice–air mixture with a real refractive index
close to 1.
Refractive index
Our soft spheroid model uses the effective medium approxi-
mation (EMA) to model the refractive index of the composite
material as an ice matrix with inclusions of air following the
Maxwell–Garnett (MG) mixing formula given in Garnett and
Larmor (1904):
eeff −ei
eeff + 2ei
= fi
ei −em
ei + 2em
,
(4)
with em,ei being the permittivities of the medium and the
inclusion, respectively, eeff the effective permittivity, and fi
the volume fraction of the inclusions.
The complex refractive index, mEMA, is then calculated
from mEMA = √eeff. In the framework of the EMA, the elec-
tromagnetic interaction of an inhomogeneous dielectric par-
ticle (components with different refractive indices) can be
approximated with one effective refractive index of a homo-
geneous particle (e.g., Liu et al., 2014; Mishchenko et al.,
2016). In Liu et al. (2014), internal mixing was proven to best
represent the scattering properties of hydrometeors. Here, the
refractive index is modeled as an internal mixing of ice with
air inclusions, which are arranged throughout the ice parti-
cle. The same work also pointed out that the size parameter
Dcrit = πd/λ for each of these air inclusions should not be
larger than 0.4 (with d as the diameter of the inclusion).
Aspect ratio
The shape of the particles is deﬁned using the aspect ratio,
AR. In this study, AR is deﬁned as the ratio of the hori-
zontal to rotational axis of the particle. From the descrip-
tion of the simulated ice spheroids in Fig. 6, it is obvious
that oblate (shaped like lentil) and prolate particles (shaped
like rice) have AR larger and lower than 1.0, respectively,
Atmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 3969–3999, 2022
https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-3969-2022
E. Tetoni et al.: Synergy of multi-wavelength and polarimetric radar measurements
3979
as the z axis is selected to be the rotational axis. Using this
principle, the representative value of sphericity S = 0.6 for
oblate ice spheroids from Hogan et al. (2012) is calculated
as AR = 1.67 in this study, and therefore this number was
used as a reference value for the simulation plots (Figs. 7, 8,
and 9a). In this work, we used S in addition to AR to com-
pare retrieval results when the oblate and prolate shape as-
sumption is used. S for oblates and prolates is found to be
smaller than 1, while for spheres it is equal to 1. Here, all
ice particles were assumed to fall with their maximum diam-
eter aligned to the horizontal plane. Hence, all ice prolates
(hereafter referred to as horizontally aligned prolates or hori-
zontally aligned prolate ice spheroids) are rotated 90◦(mean
canting angle) in the y–z plane (Fig. 6), while ice oblates
are not rotated (0◦mean canting angle). The variability of
the canting angle, i.e., the angle between the particle’s major
dimension and the horizontal plane, of the falling hydromete-
ors has been the topic of several studies. This value in nature
is not so easy to estimate, and thus a standard deviation (e.g.,
2–23◦as in Melnikov, 2017) is often additionally used. Here,
we used a ﬁxed standard deviation of 20◦to describe the os-
cillations of the particles’ maximum dimension around the
selected canting angle. Then the calculation of the scattering
properties is performed using an adaptive integration tech-
nique for all possible particle geometries, ignoring the Euler
angles (α and β) of the scattering orientation.
Mass–size relation
The maximum dimension, Dmax, and the sphericity values
for the spheroids were a priori deﬁned and their mass was
calculated according to the formula that describes the rela-
tion between mass and Dmax, i.e., mass–size relation. This
formula can provide information about the mass of the ice
particles and therefore their effective density with respect to
their size. Mass m of an ice particle is usually connected to
its maximum diameter Dmax with a power-law formula:
m(Dmax) = aDb
max,
(5)
where a is the prefactor of the m(Dmax), which refers to
the density scaling at all particles sizes, and b is the expo-
nent of the m(Dmax), which relates to the particle shape and
growth mechanisms. With the mass and the spheroid dimen-
sions known, the density of the ice spheroid was calculated.
In the special case when the density was found to exceed
that of solid ice (0.917 gcm−3), the mass of the spheroid was
clipped and its density was set equal to 0.917 gcm−3.
For the mass of the ice particles, the modiﬁed mass–size
relation of Brown and Francis (Brown and Francis, 1995) as
presented in Hogan et al. (2012), hereinafter referred to as
BF95, is initially used in this study:
m(Dmax) = 480D3
max,
Dmax < 6.6 × 10−5 m,
m(Dmax) = 0.0121D1.9
max,
Dmax ≥6.6 × 10−5 m,
(6)
where Dmax is maximum dimension of a spheroid in me-
ters (m), and m is the mass of the particle in kilograms (kg).
While the effective density of a spheroid decreases strongly
with its size due to the exponent b = 1.9 in BF95, we con-
trast this with a second m(Dmax) with a higher and constant
density. To that end, we borrowed the m(Dmax) from the ir-
regular aggregate model from Yang et al. (2000) to create
soft spheroids with an analog mass–size ratio. Originally, the
construction of these aggregates was fully described in Yang
and Liou (1998) as an aggregated collection of geometrical
hexagonal columns. In our study, this second soft spheroid
model only emulates the maximum dimension and mass of
the underlying aggregates. Assuming spheroids to represent
the ice aggregates, the density and thus the mass of the par-
ticles can be calculated via the melted-equivalent diameter
Deq using Dmax in Eq. (7). The Deq is used to describe the
diameter of a spherical water particle with the same mass as
an ice particle with maximum dimension Dmax,
m(Dmax) =

where bn is taken from Table 2 in Yang et al. (2000); the
water density ρw = 1 gcm−3 and Deq as well as Dmax are in
micrometers.
Particle size distribution
In all calculations of our study, ice particle sizes were as-
sumed to follow the normalized gamma particle size distri-
bution of Bringi and Chandrasekar (2001) with a shape pa-
rameter µ = 0 (exponential PSD), a typical value for snow
aggregates (e.g., Tiira et al., 2016; Matrosov and Heymsﬁeld,
2017, and many more):

where Nw is the intercept parameter, µ is the shape parame-
ter, D0 is the median volume diameter, and D is the melted-
equivalent diameter of the ice particles (deﬁned as Deq in
this study). The median volume diameter (D0) is one of the
three parameters used to deﬁne the gamma PSD for the scat-
tering simulations and is the size which separates the PSD in
half with respect to volume (deﬁned as

2IWC, Ding et al., 2020). Although
DWR can be used to retrieve median size D0 of PSD with-
out D0 being affected much by the density of the ice parti-
cles (e.g., Matrosov, 1998; Hogan et al., 2000), it can also
be used to retrieve Dm when a mass–size relation is investi-
gated as Dm is signiﬁcantly affected by the m(Dmax) used.
For instance, Leroy et al. (2016) found that Dm is signiﬁ-
cantly affected by the b exponent of the m(Dmax) and thus
by the mass and the density of ice hydrometeors. As we
aim to investigate how the choice of different parameters af-
fects the results of the ice retrieval (mass, shape, and me-
dian size), we were also focused on the Dm median size.
Along with the shape parameter µ and intercept parameter
Nw, soft spheroids with a deﬁned AR were used to calcu-
late Ze and speciﬁc attenuation A at both radar wavelengths
and ZDR only at 54.5 mm as this radar variable is only pro-
vided by POLDIRAD. For the refractive index calculation,
the Maxwell–Garnett mixing formula was used (e.g., Gar-
nett and Larmor, 1904). In addition to Ze, A, and ZDR sim-
ulations, the IWC of the PSD was calculated. The Nw that
corresponds to this value of IWC served as a factor for rescal-
ing to the desired IWC values used for the simulations. The
rescale factor was used for the new estimation of Ze, A, and
ZDR. In Fig. 7 an example of the gamma PSD for intercept
parameter Nw = 1 × 103, shape parameter µ = 0 (exponen-
tial PSD), different Dm values, and constant AR = 1.67 is
presented, showing how Dm and the shape of the PSD are
related. For all calculations, minimum and maximum diame-
ters of 2 × 10−2 and 20 mm were used as integration bound-
aries in the PSD of the ice particles, as we aim to retrieve
microphysics only for ice particles detected in clouds and
above the ML.

Scattering simulations
The single-scattering properties of the ice spheroids were cal-
culated using the T-matrix scattering method as described by,
e.g., Waterman (1965), Mishchenko and Travis (1994), and
Mishchenko et al. (1996). The averaging over particle orien-

tations and the calculation of radar variables for whole size
distributions are done using PyTMatrix (Leinonen, 2014)
since the simple Rayleigh approximation of Eq. (1a) can-
not be used for soft spheroids. PyTMatrix is a package that
can be easily adjusted to the user’s needs via functions and
classes regarding the desired preferences for particle shape,
size, orientation, particle size distribution (PSD), and wave-
length.
Combining the PSD with the m(Dmax) relationships of
BF95 and aggregates, scattering simulations show that ice

spheroids following the m(Dmax) of aggregates produce
more pronounced polarimetric signatures for larger ice par-
ticles due to their higher density and, in turn, higher real re-
fractive index. This is illustrated by scattering simulations
using both m(Dmax) assumptions, which are shown along
with our radar observations in Fig. 8 (the BF95 and aggre-
gate line is plotted with black and solid red, respectively).
These calculations were done for horizontally emitted radar
beams, an aspect ratio of 1.67, and an IWC of 0.50 gm−3.
Here, larger DWR values are an indication of larger particles,
while ZDR values around 0 are an indication of spherical par-
ticles. The same ﬁgure also shows scattering simulations for
ice spheroids with double and half the density of aggregates
m(Dmax) (red dashed and dash-dotted line, respectively).
This inﬂuence of density on retrieval results will be further
discussed in a sensitivity study presented in Sect. 4.3.1. In ad-
dition, Fig. 8 also shows our DWR–ZDR measurements for
low elevation angles (0–5◦) and for all 59 RHI coordinated
scans as a blue shaded density histogram. The dark blue iso-
line frames the 95th percentile of our radar observations. In
Fig. 8 it becomes apparent that the BF95 m(Dmax) relation-
ship assumed for our ice spheroids cannot explain our radar
observations for large ice hydrometeors as ZDR values drop
fast with increasing DWR due to the fast decrease in den-
sity with size. Therefore, BF95 will be excluded from further
analysis. To compare BF95 with aggregates, some retrieval
results using BF95 can be found in Sect. 4.3.1. The mass–size
relationship for aggregate ice particles can obviously better
explain the density histogram of our DWR–ZDR dataset, es-
pecially for particles with DWR > 4 dB.
Lookup table structure
Using ice spheroids that follow the m(Dmax) of aggregates,
we proceeded to the development of LUTs for different val-
ues of Dm, AR, IWC, and geometries covering the radar el-
evation angles presented in Fig. 2. Dm of the PSD was var-
ied between 0.1 and 3.02 mm in a logarithmic grid of 150
points. A minimum sensitivity limit of DWR = 0.1 dB was
used in the simulations, leading to different minimum re-
trievable Dm according to the m(Dmax) and the AR used,
but also the radar viewing geometry (more details about
this topic can be found in Appendix C). IWC was varied
between 0.00001 and 1 gm−3 in a logarithmic grid of 101
points. Scattering properties for spheroid oblate and horizon-
tally aligned prolate ice particles were calculated and saved
in separated LUTs with the aspect ratio ranging 0.125–1.0
(values: 0.125, 0.16, 0.21, 0.27, 0.35, 0.45, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0) for
the horizontally aligned prolates and the inverse values for
the oblate particles. Two examples of the scattering simula-
tions are presented in Fig. 9. For the creation of both panels
we assumed the simulated radar beams to be transmitted hor-
izontally towards each other (horizontal–horizontal geome-
try). For Fig. 9a the AR was chosen as 1.67. Radar reﬂectiv-
ity Ze at C band and DWR were calculated for different Dm
values and different values of IWC of the PSD. Larger val-
ues of radar reﬂectivity Ze at C band are observed for larger
values of Dm and larger IWC. Furthermore, as Dm increases,
DWR increases as well, indicating the sensitivity of DWR to
the size. An important remark is that for constant Dm, DWR
remains invariant to varied IWC. For Fig. 9b we chose IWC
to be 0.50 gm−3. ZDR values are found to be invariant for
all simulated values of IWC when AR, Dm, and the shape
parameter µ of PSD as well as the m(Dmax) remained the
same. All the aforementioned principles are then used to im-
plement a method for retrieving ice microphysics informa-
tion from radar measurements.
3.3
Correction of attenuation
Before using the radar observations for the development of
the ice retrieval algorithm, they need to be corrected for beam
propagation effects. One major inﬂuence is attenuation by
atmospheric gases and hydrometeors. This holds especially
true for the Ka-band radar measurements. Although snow
attenuation in the C band can be mostly neglected, espe-
cially for low-density particles and low snowfall rates (Bat-
tan, 1973; Table 6.4), the corrections will be done in both
radar bands for reliability purposes.
3.3.1
Gaseous attenuation
Both MIRA-35 and POLDIRAD radar reﬂectivities are cor-
rected for attenuation caused by atmospheric gases. Atmo-
spheric water vapor can cause considerable attenuation of
radar signals, especially at the higher frequency (35.2 GHz)
of our instrumentation. The gaseous attenuation for both
radar bands is calculated using line-by-line formulas pro-
posed by the ITU-R P.676-12 model (ITU-R P.676-12, 2019).
The corrections are implemented for oxygen and water vapor
lines where the attenuation is expected to be signiﬁcant. The
gaseous attenuation formulas use atmospheric pressure, tem-
perature, and relative humidity for each RHI obtained from
the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) Climate Data
Store (CDS) ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis data (Hersbach et al.,
2018).
3.3.2
Hydrometeor attenuation
Next to the gaseous attenuation, the hydrometeor attenuation
needs to be considered, too. For this purpose, an iterative ap-
proach using the ice microphysics results is developed. In
this way, both radar reﬂectivities are corrected to mitigate the
impact of hydrometeor attenuation on the ice microphysics
retrieval. For this approach, the retrieval algorithm is used
twice. A more detailed description of this method will be
presented in Sect. 3.4 along with the developed ice retrieval
scheme.

3.4
Development of ice microphysical retrieval
For the development of the ice retrieval scheme, radar mea-
surements of Ze, ZDR, and DWR are compared with the
PyTMatrix scattering simulations described in Sect. 3.2. The
retrieved parameters are IWC (gm−3), Dm of the PSD (mm),
and AR of the measured hydrometeors. Considering their dif-
ferent ranges, we used normalized differences between sim-
ulated and measured values of DWR as well as Ze and ZDR
at C band. By minimizing these differences, the best-ﬁtting
microphysical parameters are found. The microphysics re-
trieval is implemented in two steps using the minimization
of the two following cost functions J1 and J2:
minJ1(Dm,AR) = norm(1ZDR(Dm,AR))
+ norm(1DWR(Dm,AR))
minJ2(IWC) = norm(1Ze,C(IWC)),
(9)
where 1, the difference between simulated and measured pa-
rameters, is denoted.
Both ZDR and DWR are invariant to IWC when the same
values of Dm and AR are used. Therefore, Dm and AR are
found in the ﬁrst step, while the IWC is constrained in the
second step. While the DWR contributes to the retrieval of
Dm, the ZDR measurement merely narrows down the solu-
tion of the aspect ratio of the ice particles. As Ze at C band
is less affected by attenuation compared to the Ka band, it is
better suited to estimate the IWC. After the retrieval of size
Dm and shape AR in the ﬁrst step, the algorithm continues
with these values with the retrieval of IWC in the second step
by minimizing the cost function J2 in the LUT. Completing
these two steps, the microphysics retrieval has retrieved not
only preliminary Dm, AR, and IWC but also the speciﬁc at-
tenuation A at both radar bands, which is used for the total
attenuation estimation. As the ice retrieval produces results
using radar measurements interpolated onto a Cartesian grid,
the retrieved A at C and Ka band needs to be converted from
Cartesian to the original polar coordinates for the calculation
of the total attenuation for each radar band. After A, in po-
lar coordinates, is integrated along the radar beams, the total
attenuation for each radar dataset is calculated and converted
back from polar to Cartesian coordinates. Then, it is used to
correct Ze for both radars. In the next step, the ﬁnal micro-
physical parameters such as AR, IWC, and Dm are retrieved
using the corrected Ze from both bands as well as ZDR from
POLDIRAD. Figure 10 shows the process of attenuation cor-
rection and retrieval in more detail. An output example of the
ice microphysics retrieval scheme for the already introduced
case study from 30 January 2019 at 10:08 UTC (Figs. 11
and 12) can be found in Sect. 4.1. The total attenuation for
this case study is presented in the Supplement accompanying
this paper.

Here,
we use a case study from 30 January 2019 at 10:08 UTC, al-
ready presented before in Fig. 3, to demonstrate the output of
the ice microphysics retrieval scheme. For all the presented
results, we anticipated that the ice hydrometeors could be
represented by ice spheroids that follow the aggregates’
mass–size relation and the a priori deﬁned exponential PSD.
The microphysical properties of the detected hydrometeors
are shown in Fig. 11 (assuming oblate ice spheroids and
LUTs for different radar viewing geometries) and Fig. 12
(assuming horizontally aligned prolate ice spheroids and
LUTs for different radar viewing geometries). In Figs. 11a
and 12a, the retrieved AR is presented. Both plots suggest
that in the cross-section of the cloud between the two radars,
especially in the area below 3 km of height at a distance of
0–12 km from POLDIRAD, more spherical ice hydromete-
ors are present. Further away at a distance of 12–20 km from
POLDIRAD, more aspherical particles with AR around 4.0
and AR around 0.5 for oblates and horizontally aligned
prolates, respectively, were found. The same result is also
supported by S plots in Figs. 11c and 12c, where S > 0.6
for the spherical particles between 0 and 12 km of distance
and S < 0.6 for the aspherical particles between 12 and
20 km of distance. The retrieved AR and S could explain the
ZDR measurements well in Fig. 3d where more spherical
particles have ZDR < 0.5 dB, while aspherical particles
have ZDR > 0.5 dB. Overall, the ZDR measurements could
be replicated better with the retrieval results using oblate
ice spheroids with RMSE = 0.19 dB (RMSE refers to
the root mean square error over all grid points) between
the ﬁtted and measured ZDR for the whole scene against
RMSE = 0.25 dB when horizontally aligned prolate ice
spheroids were used. With the a priori assumptions for PSD
and mass–size relation, the retrieved Dm increasing towards
the ground is an indication that large ice particles are present
below 3 km of height compared to smaller particles that are
dominant at higher altitudes. This is obvious in both oblate
and horizontally aligned prolate results (Figs. 11b and 12b).
Comparing this plot with the DWR measurements from
Fig. 3b, we observe that the retrieved Dm could reasonably
explain DWR. The correlation between DWR and Dm is
again found to be better when oblate ice spheroids are used.
The RMSE for the ﬁtted-simulated and measured DWR is
0.50 dB when ice oblates are used in the simulations, while
RMSE = 0.61 dB when the ice particles were assumed to
be horizontally aligned prolates. Although DWR and ZDR
measurements are combined for the shape and size retrieval
(minimization of J1 in Eq. 9), the spatial pattern agreement
between DWR–Dm and ZDR-AR/S plots indicates the
strong correlation of DWR and ZDR with size and shape,

retrieved IWC for oblates and horizontally aligned prolate
ice spheroids described by m(Dmax) of aggregates and
an exponential PSD. Areas with positive POLDIRAD Ze
values in Fig. 3c correspond to IWC values higher than
1 × 10−3 gm−3. Hence, the sensitivity of Ze to the mass of
the ice particles is again indicated for both spheroid shapes
(oblates and horizontally aligned prolates). Nevertheless, the
Ze RMSE for horizontally aligned prolate ice particles is
0.36 dB, while the RMSE is found to be 0.20 dB when ice
oblates are used. All RMSEs which serve as residual values
for the ice retrieval are collected in Table 2. The lowest
RMSEs are found when oblate ice spheroids are assumed.

ibration errors for POLDIRAD (±0.5 dBZ) and MIRA-35
(±1.0 dBZ). Figure 13a indicates that the lowest values of
Dm would be retrieved if the calibration for POLDIRAD and
MIRA-35 were dZe,C = −0.5 dBZ and dZe,Ka = +1.0 dBZ,
respectively, resulting in a DWR bias of −1.5 dB. Due
to the smaller Dm retrieval, the retrieved IWC proﬁle in
Fig. 13b is the largest in this case. In the lower panels of
the same ﬁgure, the same proﬁles of Dm (Fig. 13c) and
IWC (Fig. 13d) are plotted again, now including the addi-
tional errors caused by the spatiotemporal and beam width
mismatch discussed in Sect. 3.1.2. While the beam width
mismatch can locally lead to the most signiﬁcant deviations
(shown in Fig. 5), the calibration uncertainty (red and blue
shades) in the worst case (for dZe,C = −0.5 dBZ, dZe,Ka =
+1.0 dBZ vs. dZe,C = +0.5 dBZ, dZe,Ka = −1.0 dBZ) can
lead to the largest bias throughout the proﬁle. With increas-
ing microphysical heterogeneity within a cloud, the DWR er-
ror due to the volumetric mismatch between the instruments
increases. Here, criteria would need to be deﬁned with the
estimated DWR errors indicating a non-applicability of the
multi-wavelength technique. The selection of such criteria,
however, would require an in-depth sensitivity study using
model clouds and in situ data, which is beyond the scope of
our study. Our error estimation therefore only serves as an in-
dication of areas in which the retrieval results should be taken
with caution. The lower panels of Fig. 13 also show the av-
eraged Dm and IWC proﬁle (dashed lines) as they are calcu-
lated from Fig. 12b and d when horizontally aligned prolate
ice spheroids are assumed. Between the two shape assump-
tions the horizontally aligned prolates yield a larger Dm pro-
ﬁle (+0.31 mm) on average, while oblate ice spheroids yield
a slightly larger IWC proﬁle (+0.002 gm−3). With the inﬂu-
ence of the calibration uncertainty on the retrieved Dm and
IWC proﬁle with ±0.41 mm and ±0.02 gm−3, respectively,
the shape assumption is of equal signiﬁcance for the retrieval
of Dm, while it is less important for the retrieval of IWC.

Statistical overview
After investigating 59 pairs of RHI scans from three differ-
ent snow events (9 January 2019 11:18–15:08 UTC, 10 Jan-
uary 2019 09:08–17:08 UTC, and 30 January 2019 10:08–
12:38 UTC), we created stacked histograms with respect to
temperature for a deeper insight into the retrieval. Particu-
larly, all RHI measurements from these days were compared
to scattering simulations in LUTs for oblate and horizontally
aligned prolate ice particles. Statistical results of the retrieved
S, Dm, and IWC are presented in Fig. 14. For these results, all

errors and biases described in Sect. 3.1.2 are considered for
the RHI measurements. For the statistics it is also assumed
that ice hydrometeors are represented by ice spheroids fol-
lowing an exponential PSD and with m(Dmax) correspond-
ing to that of aggregates. In the ﬁrst three panels of this
ﬁgure, results for the retrieved parameters assuming oblate
ice spheroids are presented, while in the last three panels,
the same kind of results for horizontally aligned prolate ice
spheroids are shown. At ﬁrst glance, the majority of ice hy-
drometeors are found to be neither very spherical nor very
elongated (green panel plots, ﬁrst column in Fig. 14). When
oblate ice spheroids are used in the scattering simulations,
the greater part of retrieved S values is found to range from
0.3 to 0.6. With the assumption that ice hydrometeors can
be represented by horizontally aligned prolate ice spheroids,
the distribution is narrower, with the majority of the detected

particles having S values ranging 0.4–0.6. From the Dm re-
trieval (red panel plots, second column in Fig. 14) the re-
sults for oblates showed a narrower distribution shifted to-
wards lower median mass diameters, while for horizontally
aligned prolates the retrieved values are more broadly dis-
tributed towards larger values of Dm (median value of both
distributions can be found in Table 3). The histograms for
the retrieved IWC (blue plot panels, third column in Fig. 14)
are plotted using a logarithmic x axis for visualization pur-
poses. The statistical results show that the greater part of
the detected ice hydrometeors is found to have IWC values
3 × 10−4–3 × 10−1 gm−3 (−3.5 to −0.5 in the logarithmic
axis) when oblate ice spheroids were assumed. For horizon-
tally aligned prolate ice particles, most of the detected ice
hydrometeors are found to have IWC values of 1 × 10−4–
1×10−1 gm−3 (−4 to −1 in the logarithmic axis). The spikes
in both Dm and IWC histograms are merely caused from the
strong discrepancies between simulated and measured radar
variables during the minimization of J1 and J2 in Eq. (9), i.e.,
negative measured values of DWR, while the minimum value
0.1 dB was used in the simulations (see also Appendix C).
The different color shades in all panel plots denote the dif-
ferent temperature groups in which the detected hydromete-
ors are separated. For both shape assumptions, it is observed
that when temperature drops below −25 ◦C ice hydrometeor
populations with IWC < 1 × 10−2 gm−3 dominate the par-
ticle distribution. Furthermore, for higher temperatures the
greater part of the log10IWC distribution is shifted towards
larger values in the logarithmic axis, denoting larger retrieved
IWC.
For better interpretation of the ice retrieval results during
the three snow events, we further proceeded with the cal-
culation of some descriptive statistics presented in Table 3,
always under the assumption that the detected ice hydrom-
eteors can be represented by ice spheroids whose m(Dmax)
corresponds to that of aggregates and they follow a PSD
with µ = 0. The median of the retrieved properties for the
observed particles distributions was calculated. Anticipating
that the detected ice particles can be represented by oblate
spheroids, we calculated the median retrieved S = 0.45, the
median retrieved Dm = 0.80 mm, and the median retrieved
IWC = 13×10−3 gm−3. On the contrary, when the observed
hydrometeors were assumed to be horizontally aligned pro-
late spheroids, the median retrieved sphericity, the median
retrieved median mass diameter and the median retrieved ice
water content were found to be S = 0.45, Dm = 1.08 mm,
and IWC = 5 × 10−3 gm−3, respectively. Although the two
median S values are the same, there are differences in the me-
dian Dm and IWC between oblates and horizontally aligned
prolates. For the latter, the median Dm was calculated as
larger and the IWC was calculated as lower than the respec-
tive values for oblate ice spheroids. Therefore, the shape as-
sumption seemed to affect the retrieved microphysical prop-
erties of the ice particles (also shown in Sect. 4.1). In Table 3
the 10th and 90th percentile of the detected ice hydrometeor
retrieved parameters can be also found.

Discussion
One limitation of the current version of the ice retrieval is
the need to make some signiﬁcant a priori assumptions about
the particle properties. At ﬁrst, we selected the ice spheroid
model, as the model with a small number of parameters to be
pre-deﬁned, to represent the detected ice particles. Then, we
decided about the PSD that the detected ice particles follow.
For this decision, several studies argue that a typical PSD is
described by a shape parameter close to 0 for ice particles
(e.g., Matrosov and Heymsﬁeld, 2017). Therefore, we also
chose an exponential PSD for the simulated ice spheroids.
The use of the two aforementioned assumptions was not fur-
ther investigated in this study, and they were used as already
described. The third assumption (discussed in Sect. 4.1) con-
cerns the choice of whether we assume oblate or horizon-
tally aligned prolate ice spheroids. In addition to the shape,
we have to assume a suitable m(Dmax) relationship for the
prevalent ice particles. For the three investigated snow events
the selection of m(Dmax) of aggregates over the BF95 for
ice spheroids has been partially discussed in Sect. 3.2. An
extended explanation for this selection is also presented in
Sect. 4.3.1.
4.3.1
Unknown mass–size relationship
From the two m(Dmax) relations initially used for ice
spheroids in the scattering simulations, only the m(Dmax) of
aggregates was systematically used for the statistical anal-
ysis of this study. The BF95 mass–size relation could not
represent our radar observations, especially for large ice hy-
drometeors. Although ice crystals are known to have lower
densities when they grow larger (except for graupel or hail),
BF95 prescribes near-zero density values for large particles,
especially when they are assumed to be homogeneous soft
spheroids. The homogeneity that this ice model suggests,
along with the missing internal structures and the near-ﬁeld
ice dipole interactions, that the realistic ice particles have
leads to very low simulated ZDR values with increasing par-
ticle size (Fig. 8) and decreasing particle density. The ice re-
trieval results for the examined case study, using LUTs for
oblate ice spheroids, an exponential PSD, and BF95 mass–
size relation, are presented in Fig. 15 along with the resid-
ual values of ZDR, DWR, and Ze, expressed using RMSE
values in Table 4. The RMSE for ZDR and Ze is quite low
and generally of the same order of magnitude as the RMSE
using m(Dmax) of aggregates for both oblate and horizon-
tally aligned prolate shape assumptions (Table 2). However,
with the aforementioned assumptions, the retrieved AR and
S (Fig. 15a and c) could not really explain ZDR measure-
ments (Fig. 3d). The AR is almost unrealistically high, sug-
gesting, e.g., plates for the greater part of the cloud cross-

section using BF95 m(Dmax). The RMSE for DWR with
2.27 dB was found to be quite high, suggesting that the re-
trieved Dm (Fig. 15b) could not replicate DWR measure-
ments (Fig. 3b). On the other hand, IWC (Fig. 15d) showed
good agreement with the radar measurements as it could
explain POLDIRAD Ze well (Fig. 3c). The retrieved val-
ues were found to be larger than the IWC values retrieved
using the m(Dmax) of aggregates for both shape assump-
tions. Overall, the plots of retrieved parameters as well as
the RMSE for ZDR, DWR, and Ze reveal that the output of
the ice retrieval using an exponential PSD, the m(Dmax) of
aggregates, and LUTs for oblate ice spheroids (Fig. 11 and
Table 2, but also in Table 4) was found to better explain the
radar observations compared to the BF95 assumption. Fig-
ure 16 shows the residuals between the simulated and mea-
sured DWR for aggregates (Fig. 16a) and BF95 (Fig. 16b)
m(Dmax). For ice spheroids that follow the m(Dmax) of ag-
gregates, the residuals are evenly distributed around 0 (mean
value of +0.08 dB), suggesting that this mass–size relation
can better explain our measurements in this case. In contrast,
the measured DWR appeared to be higher than the simulated
one for BF95 for the larger part of the cloud cross-section
(reddish areas) with a mean value of −0.923 dB.

To further investigate the signiﬁcance of the m(Dmax) re-
lation for the retrieval result, we conducted a small sensi-
tivity study using the aggregate assumption from Yang et
al. (2000), which suggests an almost constant effective den-
sity, ρeff, (approximately ρeff = 0.2 gcm−3) of ice particles
with increasing size. Using this value as a reference, we
created LUTs for oblate ice particles (1) with twice and
(2) with half the density of the aggregate mass–size rela-
tion (simulations also shown in Fig. 8 with red dashed and
dash-dotted lines), always with the assumption that the ice
spheroids follow an exponential PSD. Retrieval results for
ice oblates with half, equal, and twice the density of aggre-
gates are shown in panels (a–c), (d–f), and (g–i) of Fig. 17,
respectively. Corresponding RMSE values for Ze are given
in Table 4. Focusing on the IWC retrieval, we obtain lower
IWC values (with an RMSE = 0.28 dB for Ze) for ice parti-
cles with twice the density of aggregates than the IWC val-
ues retrieved in Figs. 11d or 17f. Analogously, we retrieve
larger IWC (with an RMSE = 0.23 dB for Ze) for ice parti-
cles with half the density of aggregates. In Table 4 the resid-
ual values expressed as RMSE for DWR and ZDR can also
be found. When the ice spheroids are denser with doubled
aggregates ρeff, the DWR RMSE is 0.50 dB, while the DWR
RMSE is 0.54 dB for the less dense ice spheroids. The RM-
SEs for ZDR are found to be similar with 0.21 and 0.20 dB
when ice spheroids with twice and half the density of ag-
gregates, respectively, are assumed. However, the denser ice
spheroid assumption (doubled effective density of aggregate
mass–size relation) suggests the presence of more spherical
particles compared to more aspherical particles when less
dense ice spheroids (halved effective density of aggregates)
are assumed.
The aforementioned examples indicate the limitations of
the ice retrieval to provide realistic microphysics information

when different assumptions have to be considered. To over-
come the weakness of the ﬁxed mass–size relation but still
keep our approach simple, a combination of m(Dmax) rela-
tions considering the different behavior of large or softer and
small or denser ice particles would help the retrieval, pro-
ducing more realistic microphysics results. Additional mea-
surements (e.g., Doppler velocity), in a possible extension of
this method, might be able to replace the ﬁxed m(Dmax) as-
sumption used in this approach with a whole set of m(Dmax)
depending on the average ice particle density affected by the
environment in which they are formed.
4.3.2
Comparisons to other ice retrievals
In the absence of collocated in situ observations, we pro-
ceeded to compare our retrieval results with already estab-
lished methods to infer ice microphysics. As a ﬁrst step, we
used the different aggregate mass–size relation assumptions
from the previous section to retrieve IWCs and to calculate
the corresponding ice water path (IWP). Then, we compared
our results to IWP data from the MODIS MYD06_L2 prod-
uct (Platnick et al., 2015) for our measurement region. From
MODIS, an averaged value of IWP ∼90 gm−2 was esti-
mated for the whole radar cross-section. Using our retrieved
IWC for the three assumptions (0.5×, 1×, 2× aggr. ρeff) we
obtain IWP values of approximately 46, 80, and 137 gm−2,
respectively. In comparison, the original mass–size relation
(1× aggr. ρeff) shows the best agreement with the results
from MODIS.
To further evaluate our retrieved IWC, we compared our
results with the IWC formula of Bukovˇci´c et al. (2018)
for dry snow (IWC(KDP,Ze) = 0.71KDP0.65Z0.28
e
, their
Eq. 28). For this comparison, we used our C-band radar
KDP along with Ze (and not S band as the previously

mentioned literature suggests) for the presented case study
(Fig. 3) to calculate IWC and IWP. The method of Bukovˇci´c
yields a much higher mean IWP (∼2308 gm−2) compared
to our IWP (∼80 gm−2). A deeper investigation showed
that their method assumes a much smaller melted-equivalent
particle diameter (∼300 µm vs. our retrieved ∼1 mm). As
Bukovˇci´c’s method has to assume the particle size, we con-
sider our IWP results more reasonable for a moderate snow-
fall case since our method explicitly retrieves the particle size
along with the IWC.
Furthermore, we compared our scattering calculations to
Matrosov et al. (2017, their Fig. 3b) to examine whether
we can reproduce their aspect ratio retrieval using the BF95
mass–size relation. Comparing the simulation lines we ob-
serve some differences between our calculations and those
of the aforementioned literature. For the BF95 mass–size re-
lation, a canting angle of 3◦and a median volume diameter
of 0.02 cm with ZDR = 1 dB would give an aspect ratio of
0.55 using Matrosov’s approach, while our retrieval yields
an aspect ratio of 0.45 and thus 20 % lower values. In our pa-
per we mainly use the aggregate m(Dmax) from Yang et al.
(2000). For this assumption, ZDR = 1 dB is in line with an
aspect ratio of ∼0.38 for the same median volume diameter
of 0.02 cm. For both mass–size relation assumptions, our re-
trieved aspect ratio is lower than Matrosov’s approach. Some
of this disagreement could be attributed to a different model-
ing of the composite refractive index.
4.3.3
Particles shape and viewing geometry
The retrieval results in both Figs. 11 and 12 show that some
areas are affected more than others by the shape assump-
tion inside the cloud cross-section. For instance, in the region
above the Ka-band radar, the retrieved Dm was found to be
lower when oblate ice spheroids were used compared to hori-
zontally aligned prolates. Conversely, the lower values of Dm
for ice oblates lead to a higher retrieved IWC. In these areas,
the use of the polarimetric signature from POLDIRAD, i.e.,
ZDR, is furthermore found to be crucial: not only to constrain
the shape but also to reduce ambiguities between the size
and mass of the detected ice hydrometeors. To further eval-
uate the performance of the retrieval, 2D density histograms
between retrieved Dm and measured DWR were created for
the oblate shape assumption, including all 59 RHI scans.
The histograms are presented in Fig. 18 for elevation an-
gles θC = θKa = 30◦(Fig. 18a) and θC = 10◦, with θKa = 90◦
(Fig. 18b). The ﬁrst observation geometry (Fig. 18a) is a re-
gion located between the two radar instruments, while the
second one (Fig. 18b) is located directly above the Ka-band
radar site. On top of the density histograms, the DWR–Dm
simulations for different values of AR are plotted with gray
lines. In Fig. 18a, the simulations and the retrieved Dm are
more closely distributed than in Fig. 18b. The close distri-
bution of the DWR–Dm lines in Fig. 18a suggests that the
shape and the size retrieval are not strongly correlated in
the region between the two radar systems since the simu-
lated DWR does not change much with AR. In the region
above the Ka-band cloud radar, however, polarimetric mea-
surements from the C-band weather radar POLDIRAD (i.e.,
ZDR) help to narrow down the solution space of the size re-
trieval (Fig. 18b) by providing information about the ice par-
ticle shape. This behavior is fully explained in Fig. 19, where
the radar beams passing through ice oblate spheroids are
drawn. In Fig. 19a, the radar beams from the two instruments
penetrate oblate spheroids with different AR with the same
elevation angle θC = θKa = 30◦. From the radar viewing ge-
ometry this is supposed to happen in cloud regions located
between the two radar instruments. In Fig. 19b, the elevation
angle for the C band is θC = 10◦, while the Ka band points to
zenith with θKa = 90◦. In both cases, the radar beams pene-
trate three differently shaped ice oblates that are aligned with
their maximum dimension in the horizontal plane and which
are chosen to have the same Dmax. In Fig. 19a, the length of
the Ka-band beam does not change dramatically inside the
oblate ice particle. In Fig. 19b, however, the MIRA-35 beam
length through the oblate ice particle, and hence the DWR,
is very sensitive to the aspect ratio. Therefore, the DWR–
Dm relationship becomes quite sensitive to AR in this area,
especially when particles are assumed to be horizontally ori-
ented. From similar geometric considerations, the region be-
tween the two radars at very low elevation angles is another
region in which the size retrieval beneﬁts from the AR con-
straint. In the case of variable ice crystal shapes, ZDR from
POLDIRAD is thus very helpful for the Dm estimation.

Conclusions
In the present study, we exploited dual-wavelength radar
observations from the spatially separated weather radar
POLDIRAD and cloud radar MIRA-35 to estimate the size of
ice hydrometeors. Introducing a novel approach, we used the
differential radar reﬂectivity from the weather radar to con-
strain the particle shape during the particle size retrieval. To
this end, we calculated scattering properties for a variety of
ice particles using PyTMatrix with AR/S, Dm, and IWC as
degrees of freedom for the simulated ice spheroids. Scatter-
ing simulations for all possible viewing geometries between
the cross-section of the radar instruments were then compiled
in LUTs and compared to radar observations implementing
an ice microphysics retrieval scheme. In this scheme, the ice
particles were selected to be represented by soft spheroids.
Using the microphysics retrieval and making some a priori
assumptions about the shape, PSD, and mass–size relation
of the ice spheroids, we obtained AR/S, Dm, and IWC in
ice cloud regions. Next to these parameters, we also calcu-
lated the attenuation by ice hydrometeors and corrected our
radar observations. Besides attenuation, the uncertainty of
the radar calibration has been considered. In addition, the
impact of the spatiotemporal mismatch between RHI scans

and the volumetric mismatch between the radar beams on
the measured DWR were analyzed. All aforementioned er-
rors were subsequently propagated through the retrieval to
obtain an error estimation.
Three snow events from January 2019 were used to test
the ice microphysical retrieval. The retrieved parameters for
shape, size, and mass could reasonably explain the radar
measurements of ZDR, DWR, and Ze when the detected ice
particles were assumed to be represented by oblate spheroids
(smaller RMSE and retrieval errors than for horizontally
aligned prolates) that follow an exponential PSD and the
m(Dmax) of aggregates from Yang et al. (2000). It was also
found that the well-known BF95 assumption could not rep-
resent our dataset for large particles as the density of large
ice spheroids from BF95 was calculated as lower than that of
the detected ice hydrometeors. This is merely caused when

BF95 is used along with the ice soft spheroid model. The ho-
mogeneity that this model suggests, along with the lack of
near-ﬁeld ice dipole interactions, that the realistic ice parti-
cles have against soft spheroids leads to low simulated ef-
fective density and lower simulated ZDR values. For that
reason, BF95 m(Dmax) combined with the soft spheroidal
model could not produce pronounced polarimetric signals
matching our ZDR measurements. Although the assump-
tion of aggregates m(Dmax) for ice spheroids could better
explain our ZDR–DWR observations, it suggests an almost
constant density with increasing particle size; i.e., small ice
crystals (columns or plates) appear to have the same density
as larger ice particles (aggregates). Therefore, we still need a
m(Dmax) relation which describes a more realistic function
between density and size. Here, additional measurements,
e.g., Doppler velocity of ice hydrometeors, could be ex-
ploited in future studies to provide a more variable m(Dmax)
relation instead of a ﬁxed one. In conclusion, the assump-
tion of the m(Dmax) relation can have a great impact on the
retrieval. Moreover, our approach for the retrieval’s error as-
sessment showed that, although the beam width mismatch
can locally lead to signiﬁcant deviations, the calibration un-
certainty can lead to the largest bias throughout the averaged
Dm and IWC proﬁle. Nonuniform beam-ﬁlling effects, how-
ever, can locally have strong impacts (of several dB) on DWR
measurements. Subsequent studies certainly need to explore
this effect for spatially separated radars in more detail and
need to develop techniques to detect and ﬁlter out these re-
gions. Further analysis of the error of the ice retrieval showed
that the shape assumption is equally important to the calibra-
tion uncertainty for the retrieved Dm proﬁle, while it is less
important than the calibration uncertainty for the retrieval of
IWC.
Nevertheless, promising microphysics information can be
obtained from the combination of dual-wavelength and po-
larimetric measurements from spatially separated radars.
This combination, i.e., DWR and ZDR, can reduce the ambi-
guity in Dm retrievals caused by the variable aspect ratio AR
of ice particles. While we found some inﬂuence of AR on Dm
retrievals in the region between the two radar instruments and
at high elevation angles (e.g., 30◦), ZDR from POLDIRAD
was very helpful to improve Dm retrievals above the Ka-band
cloud radar and in the areas between the two systems where
the elevation angles of both radars are low. In these regions,
ZDR measurements are essential to reduce the uncertainty
in Dm retrieval from DWR measurements of horizontally
aligned ice oblates.
The current version of the ice microphysics retrieval
scheme considers only dry ice particles. In future studies,
this methodology will be extended to include wet particles
as well. In this way, we aim for a better understanding of mi-
crophysical processes of ice growth, such as aggregation or
riming, to improve their representation in future weather and
climate models.

measurements (values of ZDR are indicated with the corresponding color bar). In the red encircled areas (a < 0.1), the retrieval results are

Appendix B: Development of an ice mask
For the ice mask implementation, variables from both radars,
i.e., the LDR from MIRA-35 as well as the ZDR and ρHV
from POLDIRAD, were used. These variables are known to
have distinct polarimetric signatures when an ML is present.
The mask was applied to each vertical proﬁle of the com-
mon grid for every pair of RHI scans. Below 4 km an ML
is detected for the following condition: MIRA-35 LDR is in
the range −22dB ≤LDR ≤−15 dB and POLDIRAD ρHV
as well as ZDR are in the range 0.75 ≤ρHV ≤0.95 and
1.5dB ≤ZDR ≤2.5 dB, respectively. As we merely focus
on stratiform snowfall precipitation cases and as we assume
that riming or melting ice is unlikely to occur, all hydrom-
eteors above 4 km a.m.s.l. and/or above the ML were ac-
counted for as dry. When the criteria were not met, the
isotherm of 0 ◦C was used as auxiliary information for ice
above that height. The temperature data were obtained from
the Oberschleißheim sounding station (about 13 km north of
Munich, source: Deutscher Wetterdienst, data provided by
University of Wyoming; http://weather.uwyo.edu/upperair/
sounding.html, last access: 8 April 2022). Although the
thresholds used in the ice mask were evaluated in precipi-
tation cases in which an ML was observed, either investigat-
ing more precipitation cases to obtain more precise thresh-
olds or using already established ML detection algorithms
exploiting polarimetric radar observations is required (e.g.,
Wolfensberger et al., 2016).
The necessity of sharpening our ice mask’s thresholds is
highlighted from Fig. B1, where an example of ZDR obser-
vations during a thunderstorm observed over Munich on 7
July 2019 at 08:22 UTC with an ML detected at 3 km is pre-
sented. Figure B1a shows ZDR without the application of
any noise ﬁlters (described in Sect. 3.1), while in Fig. B1b
the ﬁltered and masked ZDR is plotted. Figure B1c presents
the origin of the masked ZDR values. The greater part of the
cloud cross-section is masked using the 0 ◦C isotherm, re-
vealing the need for more precise ice thresholds with evaluat-
ing more case studies with mixed-phase cloud cross-sections.
In our investigated case studies, an ML was never detected
and only a very small part of the cloud cross-section was
masked using the 0◦isotherm in some cases.

Appendix C: Estimation of minimum retrievable Dm
For sensitivity purposes regarding DWR measurements we
had to consider a minimum Dm in our simulations. For this
reason, we assumed a minimum value of DWR = 0.1 dB that
can be observed by the two radars. The minimum retrievable
Dm depends not only on the viewing geometry of the two
radars but also on the AR and the m(Dmax) used for the cal-
culation of the ice spheroid density. In Fig. C1 examples of
the minimum retrievable Dm for different radar geometries
and m(Dmax) are presented. For this ﬁgure, the m(Dmax) of
aggregates is used for red and dark red line plots for the mass
estimation of the ice spheroids. When the two radar beams
are both simulated to be emitted horizontally the horiz–horiz
deﬁnition is used, while when the C-band beam is simulated
to be emitted horizontally and the Ka band towards zenith,
the horiz–vert label is used in the legend. As all ice spheroids
are assumed to be aligned to the horizontal plane with small
oscillations of up to 20◦out of this plane, the minimum re-
trievable Dm is, in general, smaller when the radar beams
are passing through the ice spheroids from the side. Assum-
ing the C-band beam to be emitted horizontally and for ice
particles with the same size, Mie effects can be stronger for
the Ka-band beam when it penetrates the particles from the
side (horiz–horiz geometry) rather than from below (horiz–
vert geometry), as the light travels a longer distance inside
the particle. For horiz–horiz geometry, Ze,Ka values are lower
and thus DWR is higher than for horiz–vert geometry for the
same particle size. Therefore, the lowest minimum retriev-
able Dm is smaller in horiz–horiz than in horiz–vert geom-
etry. From the comparison of red (ice spheroids that follow
m(Dmax) of aggregates) and blue (ice spheroids that follow
m(Dmax) of BF95) line plots, in which the radar beams are
simulated to be emitted horizontally (C band) and vertically
(Ka band), the minimum retrievable Dm using ice spheroids
following the m(Dmax) of aggregates is larger compared to
that of BF95 due to the assumption of a higher effective den-
sity of aggregates for ice spheroids of the same size. The less
dense the particles are, the smaller the Dm will be for the
minimum DWR threshold of 0.1 dB. For the same geome-
try (C band emitted horizontally and Ka band emitted verti-
cally) and both mass–size relations, the more aspherical the
particles the larger the minimum retrievable Dm due to the
larger cross-section of the horizontally aligned spheroids for
the Ka-band beam.
Figure C1. Minimum possible retrieved Dm using ice spheroids
following the m(Dmax) of aggregates when the C-band and Ka-
band beam are emitted horizontally (dark red). With red and blue,
the minimum possible retrieved Dm is plotted for ice spheroids
following the m(Dmax) of aggregates and BF95 when the C-band
beam is emitted horizontally and the Ka band is emitted towards
zenith.
