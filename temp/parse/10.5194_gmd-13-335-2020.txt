Abstract. Increasing urbanization is likely to intensify the
urban heat island effect, decrease outdoor thermal comfort,
and enhance runoff generation in cities. Urban green spaces
are often proposed as a mitigation strategy to counteract these
adverse effects, and many recent developments of urban cli-
mate models focus on the inclusion of green and blue infras-
tructure to inform urban planning. However, many models
still lack the ability to account for different plant types and
oversimplify the interactions between the built environment,
vegetation, and hydrology. In this study, we present an ur-
ban ecohydrological model, Urban Tethys-Chloris (UT&C),
that combines principles of ecosystem modelling with an ur-
ban canopy scheme accounting for the biophysical and eco-
physiological characteristics of roof vegetation, ground veg-
etation, and urban trees. UT&C is a fully coupled energy
and water balance model that calculates 2 m air temperature,
2 m humidity, and surface temperatures based on the inﬁnite
urban canyon approach. It further calculates the urban hy-
drological ﬂuxes in the absence of snow, including transpi-
ration as a function of plant photosynthesis. Hence, UT&C
accounts for the effects of different plant types on the urban
climate and hydrology, as well as the effects of the urban
environment on plant well-being and performance. UT&C
performs well when compared against energy ﬂux measure-
ments of eddy-covariance towers located in three cities in
different climates (Singapore, Melbourne, and Phoenix). A
sensitivity analysis, performed as a proof of concept for the
city of Singapore, shows a mean decrease in 2 m air tempera-
ture of 1.1 ◦C for fully grass-covered ground, 0.2 ◦C for high
values of leaf area index (LAI), and 0.3 ◦C for high values
of Vc,max (an expression of photosynthetic capacity). These
reductions in temperature were combined with a simultane-
ous increase in relative humidity by 6.5 %, 2.1 %, and 1.6 %,
for fully grass-covered ground, high values of LAI, and high
values of Vc,max, respectively. Furthermore, the increase of

Introduction
More than 50 % of the world’s population currently lives in
cities, with a predicted increase in all regions of the world
(United Nations, 2014). This growing urban population, to-
gether with the projected rise in global temperature and as-
sociated higher frequency of heat waves (IPCC, 2014), is
likely to exacerbate the urban heat island (UHI) effect (Li
and Bou-Zeid, 2013), which can have adverse effects on out-
door thermal comfort (Mitchell et al., 2016; Mora et al.,
2017), energy demand of cooling systems (Hadley et al.,
2006), and urban ecology (Zhang et al., 2004; Jochner et al.,
2013). At the same time, urban expansion increases imper-
vious surface area and can enhance heavy rainfall events
(Holst et al., 2016). These modiﬁcations intensify surface
runoff that needs to be counteracted with greater investments
in storm water sewer systems to avoid urban ﬂooding and
damage to infrastructure and valuable properties. Hence, the
negative externalities of urbanization need to be addressed
and proper mitigation strategies analysed.
Nature-based solutions, such as the increase of urban veg-
etation, are often encouraged to mitigate UHI and decrease
surface runoff as part of a sustainable urban development
(Lim and Lu, 2016; Roth, 2007; Bowler et al., 2010; Pataki
et al., 2011; Li et al., 2014; Gillner et al., 2015). For instance,
urban trees provide shade for pedestrians and evaporative
cooling (Bowler et al., 2010; Konarska et al., 2016), while an
increase in ground vegetation can further provide storm water
retention (Berland et al., 2017). In addition to urban climate
and water regulation, urban vegetation also provides other
ecosystem services, for example, carbon storage (Nowak and
Crane, 2002), enhanced biodiversity (Grimm et al., 2008),
and aesthetic, cultural, and health beneﬁts (Salmond et al.,
2016; Ng et al., 2018). Therefore, many policy-makers pro-
mote an increase of urban vegetation (Lim and Lu, 2016).
In this context, innovative numerical approaches are
needed, given the complexity of the problem, to quantify the
inﬂuence of green infrastructure on climate and water ﬂuxes
in cities and to provide guidelines for urban planners. A suit-
able modelling tool should resolve air temperature and hu-
midity at the pedestrian level, surface temperatures (includ-
ing mean radiant temperature), and wind speed to predict out-
door thermal comfort (OTC) (e.g. Höppe, 1999; Golasi et al.,
2018). Furthermore, canopy interception and subsurface hy-
drology need to be included to assess surface runoff and ac-
count for potential water stress of urban vegetation. Plant
biophysical and ecophysiological characteristics are also im-
portant to accurately predict the effects of plant evapotran-
spiration and shading on the urban climate and hydrological
cycle, as well as to evaluate climatic feedback on the well-
being of plants and their ability to continue performing the
aforementioned ecosystem services.
In recent years, a number of urban climate models started
to consider the inﬂuence of vegetation on urban micromete-
orology and hydrology. On the one hand, some models fo-
cus on the detailed representation of a particular process, for
example, solar irradiation (e.g. SOLWEIG: Lindberg et al.;
2008; RayMan: Matzarakis et al., 2007, 2010). Methods typ-
ical of computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) have been used
to predict wind patterns and proﬁles in the urban environ-
ment (e.g. OpenFoam: Allegrini and Carmeliet, 2017, Man-
ickathan et al., 2018; ENVI-met: Bruse and Fleer, 1998),
but they usually neglect or simplify other components of
the urban energy and water balance. On the other hand,
mesoscale meteorological models, for example, the Weather
Research and Forecasting model (WRF) (Skamarock et al.,
2008), provide a description of the large-scale meteorolog-
ical conditions and, when coupled with urban canopy mod-
els, can give feedback effects between mitigation strategies
and urban climate, as well as quantify the impact at dif-
ferent scales of the implementation. Urban canopy models
solve energy and water balances and have been improved
in recent years to include short ground vegetation (TEB-
Veg: Lemonsu et al., 2012; PUCM: Wang et al., 2013),
trees (VUCM: Park and Lee, 2008; TEB-Veg: Redon et al.,
2017; PUCM: Ryu et al., 2016; BEP-Tree: Krayenhoff et al.,
2014, 2015), and more detailed representations of subsur-
face hydrology (TEB-Hydro: Stavropulos-Laffaille et al.,
2018). Further advancements allow distinguishing between
deciduous and evergreen shrubs and trees (SUEWS: Ward
et al., 2016), irrigated and non-irrigated vegetation (TAR-
GET: Broadbent et al., 2018a), and plant types (VTUF-3D:
Nice et al., 2018). While these studies represent signiﬁcant
advancements in urban geoscience, some of them still present
limitations, for example, neglecting the effects of precipita-
tion (e.g. Broadbent et al., 2018a) or the inability to model
canopy level humidity (e.g. Nice et al., 2018). Hence, while
a number of urban canopy models accounting for vegetation
exist, the majority of them still have a simplistic or empiri-
cal representation of plant physiological processes, and thus
transpiration, or entirely neglect components of the hydro-
logical cycle.
In this study, we combine components of the ecohydro-
logical model Tethys-Chloris (T&C) (Fatichi et al., 2012a,
b) with components of urban canopy modelling, such as the
tree-shading scheme of the Princeton Urban Canopy Model
(Wang et al., 2013; Ryu et al., 2016), to develop the ur-
ban ecohydrological model Urban Tethys-Chloris (UT&C).
UT&C accounts for detailed plant biophysical and ecophysi-
ological characteristics and models transpiration as a func-
tion of environmental conditions (e.g. soil moisture, pho-
tosynthetic active radiation, vapour pressure deﬁcit) and
plant physiological traits. Interception on plant canopy and
ponding on impervious and soil surfaces, as well as urban
subsurface hydrology, are accounted for. UT&C is able to

simulate the inﬂuence of different conﬁgurations of green
spaces (green roofs, street trees, ground vegetation), vege-
tation types, and plant species on the urban climate and hy-
drology. It is a fully coupled energy and water balance model
that calculates 2 m air temperature, 2 m humidity, and skin
temperatures of urban surfaces.
In this article and its technical reference material (TRM),
we (1) introduce UT&C and provide a detailed technical
description; (2) show an evaluation of the model perfor-
mance in three cities with distinctive climates – Singapore,
Melbourne (Australia), and Phoenix (USA); and (3) provide
proofs of concept of the model capability with a sensitiv-
ity analysis to urban vegetation cover, and plant biophysical
(leaf area index, LAI) and ecophysiological (maximum Ru-
BisCO capacity, Vc,max) parameters.

Model design
UT&C is based on the inﬁnite urban canyon approximation
(Masson, 2000; Kusaka et al., 2001). The urban geometry
is speciﬁed with a canyon height (HCanyon), canyon width
(WCanyon), and roof width (WRoof) (Fig. 1). Street directions
are explicitly accounted for, resulting in one (partially) sun-
lit and one shaded wall (Wang et al., 2013). The ground is
partitioned into impervious (λG,imp), bare soil (λG,bare), and
vegetated (λG,veg) ground fractions, whereas the roof is par-
titioned into impervious (λR,imp) and vegetated (λR,veg) roof
fractions (Wang et al., 2013). If trees are present in the ur-
ban environment, they are represented by two inﬁnite rows
of street trees described by their height (HT), canopy radius
(RT ), and distance to the nearest wall (dT), as developed by
Ryu et al. (2016).
UT&C solves the energy and water budget (Figs. 2 and 3)
to calculate surface temperatures of sunlit and shaded wall,
tree, ground, and roof fractions. The canyon air space is sub-
divided into two layers. The canyon air temperature and hu-
midity are calculated at 2 m canyon height and at canyon
reference height, which is the sum of the zero-plane dis-
placement height of the canyon and canyon roughness length
(hdisp,can + z0,m,can; Fig. 2). The urban energy budget for the
whole atmospheric layer and the water budget are
Rn + Qf = H + λE + G (Wm−2)
(1)
P + Ir = R + E + Lk + 1S (kgm−2 s−1),
(2)
where Rn is the net all-wave radiation, Qf the anthropogenic
heat input, H the sensible heat ﬂux, λE the evapotranspira-
tion E (kg m−2 s−1) multiplied by the latent heat of vapor-
ization λ (J kg−1), G the conductive heat ﬂux which includes
the heat storage effect of the urban fabric, P the precipitation,
Ir the anthropogenic water input (irrigation), R the surface
runoff, Lk the deep leakage at the bottom of the soil column
that can be regarded as a recharge term to groundwater, and
1S the change in water storage both on the surface and in the
soil. The heat storage within the canyon air is not included in
the current version of the model. The evaporation from wall
surfaces is assumed negligible. Input data used by UT&C
are observed meteorological time series of air temperature,
humidity, air pressure, incoming shortwave and longwave ra-
diation, precipitation, and wind speed at a user-speciﬁed ref-
erence height above the urban canyon, and it is therefore run
ofﬂine but could potentially be coupled to mesoscale mete-
orological models in the future. The model runs at hourly
or sub-hourly time steps and the computational speed is ap-
proximately 500 ms per time step resulting in a simulation
time of one grid cell model set-up of roughly 1 h for 1 year
of data (hourly time step) on a commercial laptop (Intel Core
i7-6820HQ 2.7 GHz, 16 GB RAM).
2.1
Energy budget
2.1.1
Radiative transfer
The net all-wave radiation Rn, typically referred to simply as
net radiation, is the sum of net shortwave and net longwave
radiation:
Rn = S ↓−S ↑+L ↓−L ↑(Wm−2),
(3)
where S ↓is the incoming and S ↑the reﬂected shortwave
radiation, L ↓the incoming longwave radiation, and L ↑
the emitted and reﬂected longwave radiation. The incoming
shortwave radiation is partitioned into direct beam and dif-
fuse radiation using a weather generator (Fatichi et al., 2011),
and the absorbed shortwave radiation of surface i, Sn,i, is a
function of its albedo:
Sn,i = (1 −αi)(S↓dir
i
+ S↓diff
i
) (Wm−2),
(4)
where αi is the albedo of surface i, and S↓dir
i
and S↓diff
i
are
the direct and diffuse incoming shortwave radiation to sur-
face i. The amount of direct shortwave radiation received by
each urban surface is calculated considering shade according
to established methodologies (Masson, 2000; Kusaka et al.,
2001; Wang et al., 2013) if trees are absent or according to
Ryu et al. (2016) if trees are present. The diffuse shortwave
radiation received from the sky on each surface is calculated
with the respective sky-view factor. It is assumed that all
surfaces are Lambertian with diffuse and isotropic scatter-
ing and that the different ground cover fractions are homo-
geneously distributed over the ground area. Following these
assumptions, inﬁnite reﬂections of shortwave radiation are
calculated within the urban canyon with the use of view fac-
tors (Sparrow and Cess, 1970; Harman et al., 2003; Wang,
2010, 2014). The air within the canyon does not interact in
the radiative exchange; for example, the effect of airborne
aerosols is neglected (Wang, 2014).
The absorbed longwave radiation of each surface i is cal-
culated as
Ln,i = ϵi(L↓i −σT 4
i ) (Wm−2),

the mean width of the urban canyon, and WRoof the mean roof width. The ground is partitioned into impervious (λG,imp), bare (λG,bare), and
vegetated (λG,veg) fractions. The roof is partitioned into impervious (λR,imp) and vegetated (λR,veg) fractions. The location and size of urban
trees is speciﬁed by the tree height (HT), tree radius (RT), and tree distance to wall (dT).

solving the individual surface energy balances. The canyon air is subdivided into two layers, and air temperature and humidity are calculated
at 2 m height (T2 m, q2 m) and at the canyon reference height (Tcan, qcan), which is equal to the sum of zero-plane displacement height
(hdisp,can) and momentum roughness length (z0,m,can) of the canyon. Tatm and qatm are the air temperature and humidity at the reference
height for meteorological inputs, and Tb is the prescribed interior building temperature. The graph on the right shows the resistances applied
to calculate shaded and sunlit canopy transpiration, evaporation from interception, and soil evaporation within the urban canyon. rs,shade is the
stomatal resistance of shaded vegetation canopy, rs,sun the stomatal resistance of sunlit vegetation canopy, rb the leaf boundary resistance,
rsoil the soil resistance, rah,u the vertical aerodynamic resistance within the canyon, and rah the aerodynamic resistance above the urban
canyon.

(λG,imp), bare (λG,bare), and vegetated (λG,veg) ground fractions. Vertical (qvertical) and lateral (Qlateral) soil water ﬂuxes are calculated.
Runoff occurs when the maximum ponding storage capacity is exceeded. An user-speciﬁed fraction of runoff can be kept in the system as
runon.
where ϵi is the emissivity and (1 −ϵi) the reﬂectivity of
a surface for longwave radiation, L↓i the incoming long-
wave radiation, σ = 5.67×10−8 (W m−2 K−4) is the Stefan–
Boltzmann constant, and Ti (K) the surface temperature. The
incoming longwave radiation L↓i is calculated as a func-
tion of the emitted longwave radiation by the atmosphere
and the surrounding surfaces. As with shortwave radiation,
inﬁnite reﬂections of longwave radiation within the urban
canyon are calculated with the use of reciprocal view fac-
tors (Harman et al., 2003). The view factors are calculated
with analytically derived equations for an urban canyon with-
out trees (Sparrow and Cess, 1970; Masson, 2000; Harman
et al., 2003; Park and Lee, 2008; Wang et al., 2013). If trees
are present, the view factors are calculated with a simpliﬁed
two-dimensional Monte Carlo ray-tracing algorithm devel-
oped and included in the UT&C code similar to the algo-
rithms described by Wang (2014) and Frank et al. (2016).
The Monte Carlo ray-tracing view factors are corrected for
reciprocity to guarantee energy conservation.
The detailed description of shortwave and longwave radi-
ation, view factor, and Monte Carlo ray-tracing calculations
are described in Sect. 1 of the TRM.
2.1.2
Turbulent energy ﬂuxes
The total sensible and latent heat ﬂuxes are calculated as the
area-weighted average ﬂux of roof and canyon area. The tur-
bulent transport of sensible and latent heat is calculated ac-
cording to a resistance parameterization (Shuttleworth, 2012)
as
Hi = ρaCp
(Ti −Ta)
Prj
(Wm−2)
(6)
λEi = λρa
(qsat,(Ti) −qa)
Prj
(Wm−2),
(7)
where ρa (kg m−3) is the air density, Cp (J kg−1 K−1) the spe-
ciﬁc heat capacity of air at constant pressure, Ti (K) the tem-
perature of surface i, Ta (K) the air temperature, qsat,(Ti) (–)
the saturated speciﬁc humidity of surface i, qa (–) the spe-
ciﬁc humidity of the air, and Prj (s m−1) the sum of resis-
tances j to the turbulent transport of sensible and latent heat.
UT&C accounts for vertical aerodynamic resistance above
and within the urban canyon, horizontal aerodynamic resis-
tance within the urban canyon, leaf boundary layer resis-
tance, stomatal resistance of sunlit and shaded leaves, and
soil resistance (Fig. 2). The vertical wind speed proﬁle is
assumed logarithmic above the urban canopy, exponential
within the canyon, and logarithmic again close to the canyon
ground (Masson, 2000; Mahat et al., 2013). Zero-plane dis-
placement height, hdisp,can, and momentum roughness length,
z0,m,can, of the urban canopy are calculated according to the
formulations developed by Macdonald et al. (1998), which
were modiﬁed by Kent et al. (2017) to include the effects of
urban trees. The roughness length for heat and water vapour
is assumed to be 1/10 of the momentum roughness length.
The aerodynamic resistance above the urban canopy, rah, is
calculated according to Mascart et al. (1995) with a simpli-
ﬁed parameterization of the Monin–Obukhov similarity the-
ory. The vertical aerodynamic resistance within the canyon
is calculated with an undercanopy resistance parameteriza-
tion, rah,u (Mahat et al., 2013). The air volume within the
canyon is subdivided into two layers with a height equal to

the minimum between 4 m and HCanyon for the ﬁrst layer and
HCanyon −4 m for the second layer, which is not present if
HCanyon is less than 4 m. The total wall sensible heat ﬂux
is calculated as the area-weighted average of the two layers,
with only the ﬁrst layer contributing to the wall sensible heat
ﬂux at 2 m canyon height (Sect. 2.1.4 of the TRM). UT&C
allows for an average canyon height HCanyon lower than 4 m,
and, in such cases, the sensible heat ﬂux from the wall is en-
tirely contributing to the 2 m air temperature. The horizontal
aerodynamic resistance from the wall to the canyon air, rah,w,
is calculated with the respective wind speeds at mid-height
of each canyon air layer with the formulations of Rowley
et al. (1930) and Rowley and Eckley (1932). The leaf bound-
ary layer resistance, rb, describing the resistance imposed
by a thin viscous sublayer of air around the leaf surfaces,
is calculated as a function of wind speed and leaf dimension
(Fatichi et al., 2012a, b; Leuning et al., 1995; Monteith, 1973;
Choudhury and Monteith, 1988; Shuttleworth and Gurney,
1990). The soil resistance, rsoil, describes the transport of
water vapour from the soil pores to the air above the soil
surface boundary layer and is a function of the atmospheric
conditions and wetness of the surface layer (Haghighi et al.,
2013; Fatichi and Pappas, 2017). The total soil resistance is
the sum of the soil boundary layer resistance and internal
capillary-viscous resistance (Haghighi et al., 2013; Fatichi
and Pappas, 2017). The stomatal resistance, rs, describes the
transport of water vapour from the leaf interior to the air.
UT&C calculates the stomatal resistance with a biochemical
model as a function of photosynthetic activity, as described
in Sect. 2.3.1. Transpiration ﬂuxes only occur from the veg-
etation canopy fraction, which is not covered by intercepted
water. Evaporative ﬂuxes occur from ground, impervious sur-
faces (except walls) and the canopy fraction covered by in-
tercepted water. The fraction of vegetation canopy covered
by water is calculated according to Deardorff (1978).
The detailed description of all the sensible and latent heat
ﬂuxes, resistance parameterizations, wind proﬁle, displace-
ment height, and roughness length calculations can be found
in Sects. 2 and 3 of the TRM.
2.1.3
Conductive heat ﬂuxes
The conductive heat ﬂuxes of wall and roof are calculated
with a numerical solution of the heat diffusion equation (Hu
and Islam, 1995; Hillel, 1998; Núnez et al., 2010; Masson,
2000). UT&C considers two physical layers for vegetated
roof and one physical layer for impervious roof, and sun-
lit and shaded wall. The numerical solution is based on three
nodes (two layers) with the inner boundary condition equal to
the interior building temperature, Tb, which is set equal to the
atmospheric forcing temperature within the range of a spec-
iﬁed minimum Tb,min and maximum temperature Tb,max. Be-
low and above Tb,min and Tb,max, the interior building temper-
ature is ﬁxed to Tb,min and Tb,max assuming air-conditioning
or heating of the building interior (de Munck et al., 2018).
Furthermore, UT&C is able to account for a ﬁxed prescribed
interior building temperature Tb. The outer boundary condi-
tion is given by the prognostic surface temperature and in be-
tween an internal wall and roof temperature is calculated to
account for heat storage effects. The ground conductive heat
ﬂux is calculated with the force restore method (Hu and Is-
lam, 1995; Noilhan and Planton, 1989; Fatichi et al., 2012a,
b). Soil volumetric heat capacity and soil thermal conductiv-
ity are calculated as a function of soil type and soil water
content according to de Vries (1963), Farouki (1981), and
Oleson et al. (2013), as described in Fatichi et al. (2012a, b).
Further information on the calculation of the conductive
heat ﬂuxes can be found in Sect. 4 of the TRM.
2.1.4
Anthropogenic heat ﬂuxes
UT&C accounts for a prescribed time series of anthropogenic
heat ﬂux, which is added to the canyon air, assuming that heat
emissions mostly occur within the urban canyon. Hence, an-
thropogenic heat emissions caused by air conditioning, car
exhaust, industry, human metabolism, or any other anthro-
pogenic heat source need to be estimated prior to simulation,
e.g. using existing approaches (Sailor and Lu, 2004; Sailor
et al., 2015). Anthropogenic heat effects caused by domestic
heating or cooling of building interiors are already accounted
for through the conductive heat ﬂux from building interior
to canyon air that is inﬂuenced by the ﬁxed interior build-
ing temperature, as described in Sect. 2.1.3 and in Sect. 5 of
the TRM. The anthropogenic heat inputs used to assess the
model performance are based on site-speciﬁc values (Roth
et al., 2016; Chow et al., 2014) and summarized in the TRM
(Sect. 9).
2.2
Water budget
2.2.1
Interception and ponding
UT&C calculates interception of water by vegetation
canopies and ponding on impervious surfaces, bare, and veg-
etated soils. The interception and ponding dynamics are cal-
culated with a mass budget approach that can be written as
(Rutter et al., 1971, 1975; Ivanov et al., 2008; Fatichi et al.,
2012a, b)
dIn
dt = P ∗−D −EIn (mmh−1),
(8)
where In (mm) is the intercepted or ponding water, P ∗
(mmh−1) the incoming water ﬂux from precipitation and
runon, D (mmh−1) the canopy drainage or inﬁltration ﬂux
from ponding water, and EIn (mmh−1) the evaporation from
intercepted and ponding water. The maximum water pond-
ing or storage capacity of impervious surfaces is an uncertain
but important parameter to accurately model the latent heat
ﬂux after rain events (Wouters et al., 2015; Ramamurthy and
Bou-Zeid, 2014). UT&C accounts for a maximum impervi-

ous ponding capacity as well as runon, a fraction of runoff
that is kept in the system (Sect. 2.2.3).

namics can be found in Sect. 6.1 of the TRM and Sect. 2.3.3
for vegetation canopy. The maximum impervious ponding
capacity and the fraction of runoff assigned to runon used
in the model performance assessment are summarized in the
TRM (Sect. 9).
2.2.2
Vadose soil moisture dynamics
The canyon ground is discretized into n vertical soil lay-
ers and three soil columns corresponding to the impervious,
bare, and vegetated ground fractions (Fig. 3). The vegetated
roof fraction is discretized into one column with m vertical
soil layers. The ﬁrst two layers of the impervious ground
fraction are assumed impermeable with negligible porosity
and do not participate in the vadose zone dynamics. Soil un-
derneath buildings is not considered in the current parameter-
ization. The 1-D Richards equation (Richards, 1931) is ﬁrst
solved in the vertical direction for each soil column using a
ﬁnite volume approach with the methods of lines (Lee et al.,
2004; Fatichi et al., 2012a, b) as
dz,j
dθj
dt = (qj−1−qj)−Ttree rtreej −Tveg rvegj −Eg (mmh−1),
(9)
where θj (–) is the soil water content, dz,j (mm) is the soil
layer thickness, and qj−1 and qj (mmh−1) are the vertical
inﬂow and outﬂow of soil layer j. The transpiration sinks
of ground vegetation and trees, Tveg and Ttree (mmh−1), are
weighted by their root biomass fraction in each soil layer,
rvegj and rtreej (–). The soil evaporation, Eg (mmh−1), is
only present in the ﬁrst (j = 1) soil layer of the bare and
vegetated soil column. In a second step, the 1-D Richards
equation (Richards, 1931) is solved laterally as
dz,j
dθj
dt = (Ql,in,j −Ql,out,j) (mmh−1),
(10)
where Ql,in,j and Ql,out,j (mmh−1) are the lateral inﬂow
and outﬂow of soil layer j with respect to the adjacent soil
columns. Exchange of soil moisture between all three soil
columns is included in the model, resulting in three lateral
ﬂuxes. The vertical qj and lateral Ql,j ﬂuxes of water in the
soil are calculated according to the gradients of soil water
potentials (see Sect. 6.2.1 of the TRM). The inﬁltration into
the ﬁrst soil layer is either the maximum inﬁltration capac-
ity or the water available at the surface, depending on which
is limiting. The maximum inﬁltration capacity for bare and
vegetated surfaces is calculated based on the hydraulic gra-
dient between ponding water (if any) and water potential in
the ﬁrst soil layer. The maximum inﬁltration through the im-
pervious ground surface is a model parameter, and the inﬁl-
trated water is directly added to the third soil layer as the
ﬁrst two layers are not interacting with the vadose zone dy-
namics. The water percolating from the last soil layer n or m
is called deep leakage. The formation of a shallow ground-
water table is possible if soil hydraulic conditions allow or
if an impermeable boundary condition is prescribed at the
bottom of the soil column (Fatichi et al., 2012a, b). The soil
hydraulic properties are calculated based on the soil textural
composition using pedotransfer functions, and soil hydraulic
conductivity and soil water retention curve can either be de-
scribed with the van Genuchten (1980) or Saxton and Rawls
(2006) parameterizations.
The detailed description of the vadose zone dynamics can
be found in Sect. 6.2 of the TRM.
2.2.3
Runoff and runon
Runoff is generated when the maximum inﬁltration capacity
and then interception capacity of a surface are exceeded. The
total roof and ground runoff is calculated as the area averaged
runoff of each surface fraction. UT&C allows users to specify
a percentage of runoff that stays in the system for one time
step (1 h) and it is re-added as runon evenly to either roof or
ground areas. Allowing for a runon component is important
to model urban areas where excess water from one surface
does not exit immediately the system but remains in place
(e.g. ﬂat roof) or is redirected to another surface, for example,
bioswales. Further information on the calculation of runoff
and runon can be found in Sect. 6.3 of the TRM.
2.2.4
Anthropogenic water
UT&C accounts for anthropogenic water in the form of a pre-
scribed urban irrigation time series for vegetated roof, bare
ground, and vegetated ground. The irrigation can be added
to the soil surface underneath vegetation to represent drip ir-
rigation or above the vegetation surface to represent sprin-
kler or hose irrigation. The irrigation schemes used during
the model performance assessment are described in Sect. 9
of the TRM. Urban vegetation in Phoenix is heavily depen-
dent on irrigation year round and the irrigation time series is
modelled as described by Volo et al. (2014).
2.3
Vegetation processes
2.3.1
Photosynthesis and stomata behaviour
Plants open their stomata to allow CO2 exchange between the
atmosphere and the chloroplasts inside their leaves and per-
form photosynthesis. This leads to an inevitable loss of wa-
ter vapour from the water-saturated tissue within the leaves
(Sellers et al., 1997). UT&C applies a biochemical model to
describe the coupling between stomatal resistance and pho-
tosynthesis (Fatichi et al., 2012a, b). The stomatal behaviour
is dependent on the net CO2 assimilation rate (i.e. photosyn-
thesis), atmospheric vapour pressure deﬁcit, and intercellu-
lar CO2 concentration (Leuning, 1995). The net assimilation

N. Meili et al.: Urban ecohydrological model, Urban Tethys-Chloris (UT&C)
rate is a function of three limiting rates of enzyme kinetics:
the RuBisCO enzyme limited carboxylation rate, the rate of
photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) captured by the leaf
chlorophyll, and the limiting rate of product export and us-
age (Farquhar et al., 1980; Collatz et al., 1991, 1992; Fatichi
et al., 2012a, b). The rates of enzyme kinetics are inﬂuenced
by the leaf temperature. The net photosynthetic assimilation
rate is further inﬂuenced by water stress that is inducing
stomatal closure (e.g. Zhou et al., 2013).
The detailed mathematical formulations of the biochemi-
cal model to calculate net CO2 assimilation rate and stomatal
resistance are described in Sect. 3.6.2 and 3.6.3 of the TRM.
2.3.2
Upscaling from leaf to canopy
UT&C applies a “two big leaves” approach that divides vege-
tation canopy into sunlit and shaded fractions (Wang and Le-
uning, 1998; Fatichi et al., 2012a). The photosynthetic activ-
ity is calculated individually for the two fractions to account
for the light limitation occurring in the shaded leaves, which
only receive diffuse radiation. UT&C uses an exponential de-
cay of direct beam radiation and leaf nitrogen content with
leaf area throughout the vegetation canopy to scale photo-
synthetic capacity from leaf to canopy level (Dai et al., 2004;
Ivanov et al., 2008; Fatichi et al., 2012a). The current version
of UT&C does not include a seasonally changing LAI, but
time series of LAI can be supplied as model input if needed.
The detailed description of the leaf to canopy upscaling
can be found in Sect. 3.6.1 of the TRM.
2.3.3
Canopy interception
Vegetation canopy interception is modelled using a mass
budget approach and the Rutter model, as described in
Sect. 2.2.1. The fraction of precipitation arriving onto the
canopy foliage and its throughfall is modelled as a function
of the projected leaf area fraction onto the ground. The pro-
jected leaf area fraction is a function of leaf area index (LAI)
and stem area index (SAI) (Mahfouf and Jacquemin, 1989).
Interception excess drainage occurs if the precipitation on the
canopy foliage exceeds the maximum interception capacity
of the vegetation canopy. The maximum canopy interception
capacity is calculated as a function of LAI and SAI according
to Dickinson et al. (1993). Dripping from intercepted water
on the canopy is calculated according to the Rutter model
(Rutter et al., 1971; Mahfouf and Jacquemin, 1989).
Further description of the canopy interception calculations
can be found in Sect. 6.1.1 of the TRM.
2.3.4
Root water uptake and root biomass distribution
The root water uptake from different soil layers is calculated
according to the vertical and horizontal plant root biomass
distribution.
UT&C allows to distinguish between four different verti-
cal root biomass proﬁles (Fatichi et al., 2012a, b): (1) an ex-
ponential vertical root proﬁle (Arora and Boer, 2005), (2) a
linear dose response root proﬁle (Schenk and Jackson, 2002;
Collins and Bras, 2007), (3) a constant vertical root proﬁle,
and (4) a linear dose response proﬁle with tap roots. The root
biomass proﬁle of short stature roof and ground vegetation
is horizontally contained within the roof and ground vege-
tated areas, while two different horizontal root proﬁles are
distinguished for tree roots: (1) the tree roots are evenly dis-
tributed over the total canyon width, and (2) the tree roots
are horizontally restricted to the tree canopy extent, which
is assumed to be mainly located over the vegetated and bare
ground fractions. The choice of horizontal tree root distri-
bution is inﬂuenced by the patch size distribution as well
as the heterogeneity of the pervious ground cover fraction
and this affects soil moisture access by trees. The root wa-
ter uptake can be limited by the water availability in the soil
or the hydraulic resistance from the soil to the root (Fatichi
et al., 2012a, b). Currently, UT&C does not include a plant
hydraulic module and it is assumed that the leaf and xylem
water potential are equal to the soil water potential experi-
enced within the root zone (Fatichi et al., 2012a, b). Hence,
root water uptake is equal to transpiration, and water storage
in plant tissue is neglected even though in certain conditions
it could be signiﬁcant (e.g. Mirfenderesgi et al., 2016; Huang
et al., 2017).
The detailed description of vertical and horizontal root
proﬁles, soil-to-root resistance, and root water uptake calcu-
lations can be found in Sect. 7 of the TRM.

Methods and data
3.1
Model performance assessment sites: Singapore,
Melbourne, and Phoenix
UT&C is tested to reproduce tower-based eddy-covariance
measurements from Telok Kurau in Singapore (Velasco et al.,
2013; Roth et al., 2016), Preston in Melbourne, Australia
(Coutts et al., 2007a, b), and Maryvale in Phoenix, AZ (Chow
et al., 2014). The measurements at all three sites have been
performed according to known guidelines to ensure that the
measurements are representative of the underlying surface
at the neighbourhood scale, have followed accepted mea-
surement protocols, and passed quality-control checks as de-
scribed in detail in Velasco et al. (2013), Roth et al. (2016),
Coutts et al. (2007a, b), and Chow et al. (2014). The mea-
surement sites will afterwards be referred to as Singapore,
Melbourne, and Phoenix, respectively.
Singapore experiences a tropical rainforest climate (Köp-
pen classiﬁcation: Af) with uniformly high air temperature
throughout the year (data mean: 27.5 ◦C), high relative hu-
midity (data mean: 71 %), and abundant rainfall (data mean:
∼1840 mm yr−1, which is lower than the long-term mean
of ∼2340 mm yr−1) (Table 1) (Velasco et al., 2013; Roth
et al., 2016). Two monsoonal wind regimes are observed:

the southwest monsoon (June to September) and the north-
east monsoon (December to mid-March) (Velasco et al.,
2013; Roth et al., 2016). The meteorological time series
used in this study is characterized by an unusual dry pe-
riod from mid-January 2014 to mid-March 2014, with an al-
most complete absence of rainfall (Harshan et al., 2017; De-
muzere et al., 2017). The Singapore measurement site is lo-
cated in the Telok Kurau district (1◦18′51′′ N, 103◦54′40′′ E;
∼10 m a.s.l.), which corresponds to a “compact low-rise” lo-
cal climate zone (LCZ3) (Stewart and Oke, 2012). It is a res-
idential area with a mean building and tree height of 9.86 and
7.26 m, respectively, and an area averaged height-to-width
ratio (H / W) of 0.61 (Velasco et al., 2013; Roth et al., 2016;
Demuzere et al., 2017). The surface cover consists of 39 %
buildings, 34 % paved and gravel, 12 % roads, 11 % trees,
4 % grass, and 1 % water (Velasco et al., 2013; Roth et al.,
2016). The Telok Kurau eddy-covariance measurement site
and set-up are described in detail in Velasco et al. (2013) and
Roth et al. (2016).
Melbourne experiences a seasonal temperature cycle with
warm summers and mild winters (data mean: 13.5 ◦C). The
mean observed relative humidity is relatively high (data
mean: 67 %), while the precipitation amount is moder-
ate (data mean: ∼741 mm yr−1) and is evenly distributed
throughout the year (Table 1). The ﬂux tower was located
in the suburb of Preston (37◦49′ S, 144◦53′ E; ∼93 m a.s.l.)
(Coutts et al., 2007a, b) in a low-density, moderately de-
veloped residential area classiﬁed as an “open low-rise”
local climate zone (LCZ6) (Stewart and Oke, 2012; Best
and Grimmond, 2015) with mean building height of 6.4 m
(Coutts et al., 2007a, b). The land surface is covered by
44.5 % buildings, 4.5 % concrete, 13 % road, 22.5 % vege-
tation, 15 % grass, and 0.5 % bare ground or pools (Coutts
et al., 2007a, b; Grimmond et al., 2011; Best and Grimmond,
2015). Further information on the Preston measurement cam-
paign can be found in Coutts et al. (2007a, b).
Phoenix has a hot, arid subtropical desert climate (Köp-
pen classiﬁcation: BWh) (Chow et al., 2014). Its tempera-
ture is characterized by a yearly cycle with very high sum-
mer and cooler winter temperatures (data mean: 24.1 ◦C),
and very low relative humidity (data mean: 28 %) (Table 1).
The yearly precipitation amount is small and occurs dur-
ing winter (December–February) and in summer during the
North American monsoon season (July–September) (Tem-
pleton et al., 2018). The measured time period exhibits lower-
than-average rainfall with 99 mm yr−1 (Table 1). The eddy-
covariance measurement tower was set up in the suburb
of Maryvale (33◦29′2′′ N, 112◦8′35′′ W; 337 m a.s.l.), which
corresponds to an “open low-rise” local climate zone (LCZ6)
(Stewart and Oke, 2012). It is a suburban residential area
with low-rise, single-family, one-story houses with a mean
building and tree height of 4.5 and 4 m, respectively, and a
H / W of 0.4 (Chow et al., 2014). The land cover consists
of 26 % buildings, 22 % roads and asphalt, 5 % trees, 10 %
grass, 37 % bare soil, and < 1 % water and pools (Chow et al.,
2014). The landscape is mostly xeric (dry), and hose irriga-
tion is used to water gardens. Detailed information on the
Maryvale eddy-covariance study site can be found in Chow
et al. (2014).
The exact model parameters used in the UT&C valida-
tion in Singapore, Melbourne, and Phoenix can be found in
Sect. 9 of the TRM.
3.2
Model performance metrics
The UT&C assessment is based on the comparison between
measured and simulated outgoing shortwave radiation S ↑,
outgoing longwave radiation L ↑, net absorbed all-wave ra-
diation Rn, sensible heat ﬂux H, and latent heat ﬂux λE.
The comparison is based on time series of hourly day- and
nighttime ﬂuxes, and daily cycles of ﬂux mean and stan-
dard deviation. Model performance is assessed considering
the coefﬁcient of determination (R2), root mean square er-
ror (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean bias er-
ror (MBE). Furthermore, the systematic (RMSEs) and non-
systematic (RMSEu) components of the RMSE error (Will-
mott, 1982) are calculated and reported in Sect. 10 of the
TRM. All model performance indices are calculated with the
available data of the full time period speciﬁed for each loca-
tion (Tables 1, 2, and 3) including all weather conditions, ex-
cept for hours with instantaneously occurring rainfall (Chow
et al., 2014; Roth et al., 2016). Shortwave radiation perfor-
mance is assessed only considering daytime values. Separate
model performance is also calculated for day- and nighttime
and reported in Sect. 10 of the TRM as well as for an ex-
ceptional dry period from 15 February to 16 March 2014 in
www.geosci-model-dev.net/13/335/2020/

Singapore (Table 3). Daytime is deﬁned as 08:00–18:00 LT
for Singapore and as times with positive incoming shortwave
radiation for Melbourne and Phoenix. Nighttime is deﬁned as
20:00–06:00 LT for Singapore and as times with no incoming
shortwave radiation for Melbourne and Phoenix. The over-
all model performance results are compared to literature that
validates other urban canyon models using ﬂux tower mea-
surements from Telok Kurau in Singapore, Preston in Mel-
bourne, and Maryvale in Phoenix (Table 2).
The total assessment period in Telok Kurau, Singapore, is
1 year (1 May 2013–30 April 2014; Table 1). The UT&C
model performance results are compared to the previous
studies of Demuzere et al. (2017), Harshan et al. (2017), and
Liu et al. (2017), who used the same eddy-covariance mea-
surements from Telok Kurau. Demuzere et al. (2017) anal-
ysed the model performance of four urban canopy models
(SURFEX: Masson et al., 2013; CLM v4.0: Bonan et al.,
2011; Lawrence et al., 2011; TERRA_URB: Wouters et al.,
2015, 2016; SUEWS: Ward et al., 2016). Harshan et al.
(2017) analysed the performance of one model (TEB: Mas-
son, 2000), and Liu et al. (2017) used ﬂux tower data to val-
idate a coupled Noah/SLUCM model after the implementa-
tion of tree evapotranspiration. Additionally, the simulation
of 2 m air temperature in Singapore is compared to the mea-
surements (11 November 2013–19 April 2014) presented by
Harshan et al. (2017), which were digitized for this purpose.
The total observational period in Preston, Melbourne, is
approximately 15.5 months (13 August 2003–28 Novem-
ber 2004) (Table 1). The UT&C model performance results
are compared to results from the international urban energy
model comparison, phase 2, by Grimmond et al. (2011), who
analysed the performance of 32 urban land surface models
with eddy-covariance measurements from Preston. The re-
ported RMSE and MBE is the median performance of all
the models with radiation budget closure, while R2 values
are determined from the reported Taylor diagrams. Further-
more, the UT&C model performance results for Melbourne
are compared to the performance of VTUF-3D v1.0 (Nice
et al., 2018), which also includes an ecohydrological compo-
nent and was assessed against Preston eddy-covariance mea-
surements (Nice et al., 2018).
The total assessment period in Maryvale, Phoenix, is ap-
proximately 1 year (17 December 2011–31 December 2012)
(Table 1) (Chow et al., 2014). The UT&C model perfor-
mance results are compared to the results of Song and Wang
(2015), who assessed a single-layer urban canopy model
(Wang et al., 2011, 2013) in Maryvale, Phoenix. Song and
Wang (2015) only use a 5 d period for model performance
assessment though, while the UT&C model statistics are cal-
culated for the full reported time period. Additionally, the
simulation of bare ground temperature at 2 cm soil depth in
Phoenix is compared with soil temperature measurements at
the same depth conducted by Chow et al. (2014). Since the
soil thermal proﬁle is not a direct output of the model, the
simulated bare ground surface temperature at 2 cm soil depth
was calculated using the bare ground surface temperature
and a numerical solution of the heat diffusion equation with
mixed boundary conditions assigning surface temperature at
the top of the soil column and zero ground heat ﬂux at 2 m
depth.
3.3
Model capability and sensitivity analysis
The capability of UT&C to describe urban climate, hydrol-
ogy, and vegetation is further shown through the modelled
time series of soil moisture, the resulting plant water stress,
and decrease in latent heat during the dry period of Febru-
ary 2014 in Singapore. Furthermore, the effect of changes
in vegetated ground cover within the urban canyon (λG,veg),
LAI, and maximum RuBisCO capacity (Vc,max) on the long-
term 2 m air temperature, 2 m relative humidity, and the en-
ergy and water budget is shown through a sensitivity analysis
using the background climate, urban fabric, and geometries
of Telok Kurau in Singapore (see Sect. 9 of the TRM for
parameter set-up of Telok Kurau). Relative humidity is de-
pendent on the saturation vapour pressure which is directly
connected to the air temperature, and therefore relative hu-
midity changes are also linked to temperature changes and
not only the water content in the air. In this study, the anal-
ysis of relative humidity is chosen, as it plays a key role
in the outdoor thermal comfort of humans. The simulation
time series length is 1 year, and the results are analysed as
mean changes over the whole time period, mean changes dur-
ing an unirrigated dry period (15 February–16 March 2014),
and mean daily cycles averaged over the whole year, re-
spectively. Mean changes are computed in comparison to a
non-vegetated condition for the increase of λG,veg, in com-
parison to the ﬂux tower baseline condition (λG,veg = 25 %
and λtree = 18 % within the urban canyon) with a LAI of 0.5
for the LAI increase, and in comparison to the ﬂux tower
baseline condition with Vc,max of 20 µmol CO2 s−1 m−2 for
the Vc,max increase. λG,veg is varied between 0 and 100 % (0
and 1), LAI between 0.5 and 5, and Vc,max between 20 and
120 µmol CO2 s−1 m−2 (the ﬁgure of the schematic set-up is
presented in Sect. 10 of the TRM). These ranges correspond
to realistic values of biophysical and physiological param-
eters observed in nature (Wullschleger, 1993; Kattge et al.,
2009; Iio et al., 2014; Paschalis et al., 2018; Manoli et al.,
2018). Low values of λG,veg specify a low amount of ground
vegetation within the urban canyon, low values of LAI spec-
ify a thin vegetation canopy, and low values of Vc,max specify
plants with small photosynthetic and transpiration capacity.
The sensitivity analysis for vegetated ground cover is per-
formed without trees, as a fully sealed ground surface with
trees is not a realistic scenario. The increase of LAI and
Vc,max includes vegetated ground cover and trees, and the
parameters are simultaneously increased for both vegetation
types.

Model performance
4.1.1
Outgoing shortwave and longwave radiation, and
net all-wave radiation
Modelled and observed S ↑show good agreement with a
high R2 of 0.97, 0.99, and 0.98 for Singapore, Melbourne,
and Phoenix, respectively (Table 2). S ↑is generally well
predicted in urban climate models with high R2 of 0.98
or above, as shown by Grimmond et al. (2011) and De-
muzere et al. (2017) in their model intercomparison stud-
ies. UT&C is able to accurately simulate the mean diur-
nal cycle and variability of S ↑(Sect. 10 of the TRM)
but slightly underpredicts S ↑in all three locations with
MBEs of −5.5, −12.5, and −5.9 W m−2 for Singapore, Mel-
bourne, and Phoenix, respectively (Table 2). UT&C shows
improved modelling of S ↑for the Singapore site, with
MBE = −5.5 and RMSE = 9.7 W m−2, compared to TEB
with MBE = −10.6 and RMSE = 17.0 W m−2 (Harshan
et al., 2017). The MBE = −12.5 and RMSE = 16.3 W m−2
of the UT&C simulation in Melbourne lie within the range
reported by Grimmond et al. (2011) but are worse than the
median model (conserving radiation budget), with MBE = -
0.5 and RMSE = 6 W m−2. Phoenix overall shows good re-
sults, with MBE = −5.9 and RMSE = 10.7 W m−2.
Modelled and measured L ↑show a high R2 of 0.93,
0.94, and 0.98 for Singapore, Melbourne, and Phoenix, re-
spectively (Table 2). These values are within the range re-
ported by Demuzere et al. (2017) in Singapore (R2 = 0.92–
0.96) and the range reported by Grimmond et al. (2011)
in Melbourne (R2 = 0.90–0.98). The UT&C simulation in
Singapore shows an overestimation of L ↑during the day
and an underestimation of L ↑during the night (Sect. 10
of the TRM). These trends are consistent throughout the
year and similar trends are also observed by Harshan et al.
(2017). UT&C shows an improved modelling of L ↑with
MBE = 8.3 and RMSE = 23.3 W m−2, compared to TEB
in Singapore with MBE = 13.3 and RMSE = 33.3 W m−2
(Harshan et al., 2017) (Table 2). The MBE = 7.8 and
RMSE = 14.8 W m−2 of the UT&C simulation in Mel-
bourne are similar to the median model (MBE = 8 and
RMSE = 16 W m−2) reported by Grimmond et al. (2011).
The mean daily cycle and variability of L ↑is well repre-
sented by the UT&C simulation in Phoenix, with a small pos-
itive MBE = 4.9 W m−2 and RMSE = 11.5 W m−2 (Table 2
and Sect. 10 of the TRM).
The net all-wave radiation Rn shows very good agree-
ment in all three sites with R2 of > 0.99, > 0.99, and > 0.99
for Singapore, Melbourne, and Phoenix, respectively (Ta-
ble 2). These results agree with the high R2 values of > 0.98
reported in the literature for Singapore (Demuzere et al.,
2017) and Melbourne (Grimmond et al., 2011). Similarly,
the diurnal cycle, time series, and correlation plots show
good agreement between model prediction and measure-
ment (Fig. 4). The MBE = −4.9 and RMSE = 20.8 W m−2
of the UT&C simulation in Singapore shows a slight im-
provement compared to the values of MBE = −6.1 and
RMSE = 27.6 W m−2 reported by Harshan et al. (2017) (Ta-
ble 2). The MBE = −0.6 and RMSE = 9.5 W m−2 of the
UT&C simulation in Melbourne shows an improvement
compared to the median of the models with MBE = −6 and
RMSE = 18 W m−2 reported by Grimmond et al. (2011) and
MBE = 3 and RMSE = 19 W m−2 reported by Nice et al.
(2018) for VTUF-3D (Table 2). The RMSE = 12.5 W m−2 of
the simulation in Phoenix shows a slight improvement com-
pared to the RMSE = 20 W m−2 reported by Song and Wang
(2015) (Table 2).
4.1.2
Sensible heat ﬂux
A relatively high R2 between measured and simulated sensi-
ble heat ﬂux, H, is observed, with R2 = 0.94, R2 = 0.90, and
R2 = 0.92 for Singapore, Melbourne, and Phoenix, respec-
tively (Table 2). These values lie within the range reported in
the literature with R2 = 0.90–0.92 for Singapore (Demuzere
et al., 2017), and R2 = 0.72–0.90 for Melbourne (Grimmond
et al., 2011; Nice et al., 2018). UT&C overestimates sensi-
ble heat ﬂux in Melbourne during daytime, while the day-
time sensible heat ﬂux in Singapore and Phoenix is well
predicted (Fig. 5). The overall model performance statis-
tics with MBE = −4.0 W m−2 and RMSE = 23.5 W m−2 for
Singapore are similar to the results of MBE = 5.3 W m−2
and RMSE = 27.9 W m−2 reported by Harshan et al. (2017)
(Table 2). The simulation in Melbourne shows an improve-
ment in RMSE, with RMSE = 36.6 W m−2 compared to
the literature values, i.e. RMSE = 47 W m−2 (Grimmond
et al., 2011) and RMSE = 40.2 W m−2 (Nice et al., 2018);
however, the UT&C simulation shows a larger bias with
MBE = 14.4 W m−2 compared to MBE = 4 W m−2 (Grim-
mond et al., 2011) and MBE = −4 W m−2 (Nice et al., 2018)
(Table 2). Even though the mean daytime cycle is well rep-
resented, the simulation in Phoenix shows a relatively large
MBE = 10.9 W m−2 due to a overprediction at night. The
simulated RMSE = 27.4 W m−2 shows a slight improvement
compared to the literature value of RMSE = 34 W m−2 (Song
and Wang, 2015) (Table 2).
4.1.3
Latent heat ﬂux
The latent heat ﬂux λE is commonly the most difﬁcult en-
ergy ﬂux to predict in urban canopy modelling (Grimmond
et al., 2011; Ramamurthy et al., 2014), because it is typically
of lower magnitude and more variable than the other ﬂuxes,
with assumptions about frequency and amount of irrigation
adding further uncertainty. The R2 values of the UT&C sim-
ulation with R2 = 0.60, R2 = 0.62, and R2 = 0.50 for Sin-
gapore, Melbourne, and Phoenix, respectively, lie within
the reported literature range of R2 = 0.34–0.61 (Demuzere

et al., 2017) for Singapore, and R2 = 0.30–0.61 (Grimmond
et al., 2011), R2 = 0.45 (Nice et al., 2018) for Melbourne
(Table 2). The UT&C simulation is able to capture the
mean daily cycle of latent heat in Singapore, Melbourne,
and Phoenix (Fig. 6). The variability of λE shown as stan-
dard deviation in the mean daily cycle plots is well pre-
dicted in Melbourne, whereas it is underestimated in Sin-
gapore and Phoenix (Fig. 6). During model development,
it was observed that the variability of λE is heavily inﬂu-
enced by the maximum ponding storage capacity of imper-
vious surfaces, which is difﬁcult to estimate in a hetero-
geneous urban environment. UT&C shows an improvement
of latent heat simulation in Singapore with MBE = −1.2
and RMSE = 28.1 W m−2, compared to the MBE = −10.8
and RMSE = 44.3 W m−2
reported by Harshan et al.
(2017), and the MBE = −12.0 and RMSE = 38.7 W m−2
reported by Liu et al. (2017). Likewise, the simulation
in Melbourne shows a slight improvement in RMSE,
with RMSE = 26.8 W m−2 compared to RMSE = 40 W m−2
(Grimmond et al., 2011) and RMSE = 33.1 W m−2 (Nice
et al., 2018), while MBE = 1.9 W m−2 of the simulation
in Melbourne shows a decrease and increase in model
performance compared to MBE = −0.8 W m−2 (Grimmond
et al., 2011) and MBE = −9.5 W m−2 (Nice et al., 2018).

Simulated RMSE = 19.5 W m−2 with UT&C and literature
RMSE = 20 W m−2 (Song and Wang, 2015) are relatively
similar for Phoenix.
Overall, UT&C shows an equal or improved ability to
model the latent heat ﬂux in comparison to other models ap-
plied to Singapore, Melbourne, and Phoenix. Additionally,
UT&C shows an improved modelling of latent heat during
the dry period in Singapore with an R2 value of 0.67, MBE of
2.5 W m−2, RMSE of 16.2 W m−2, and MAE of 10.5 W m−2
compared to the results of Harshan et al. (2017) that show
MBE of −20.2 W m−2, RMSE of 33.7 W m−2, and MAE of
21.7 W m−2. The reason for UT&C’s more accurate predic-
tion of the latent heat ﬂux during prolonged dry periods is
its explicit representation of soil moisture access by plant
roots at different soil depths and modelling of plant response
to water stress (see Sect. 4.2). The improved prediction can
also be seen from mid-January to mid-March 2014 when
UT&C predicts a latent heat ﬂux comparable in magnitude to
the measured latent heat ﬂux (Fig. 6), whereas other models
signiﬁcantly underpredict λE during this period (Demuzere
et al., 2017; Harshan et al., 2017).

Bare ground surface temperature (Phoenix) and
2 m air temperature (Singapore)
We compare simulated bare ground temperature at 2 cm
depth with measured 2 cm soil temperature in Phoenix. Mod-
elled and measured bare ground temperatures show a high
agreement with R2 of 0.98, MBE of −0.1 ◦C, RMSE of
2.2 ◦C, and MAE of 1.7 ◦C. UT&C slightly underpredicts
(overpredicts) ground temperature during the day (night) and
shows a slight phase shift but is overall able to accurately
predict bare ground temperature (Fig. 7).
UT&C overpredicts (underpredicts) 2 m air temperature in
Singapore during the day (night) compared to the measure-
ment conducted by Harshan et al. (2017). The overall mean
difference (MBE) is −0.05 ◦C. The mean overprediction dur-
ing daytime is 0.9 ◦C, with the maximum value of 2.3 ◦C oc-
curring at 13:00 LT. The overall mean underprediction dur-
ing nighttime is −1.2 ◦C, with the largest negative value of
−1.4 ◦C occurring at 06:00 LT (Fig. 8). This result is not sur-
prising and is coherent with the biases observed in Singapore
for longwave radiation. Furthermore, the 2 m air temperature
measured at the ﬂux tower area, an open grass ﬁeld, might

4.2
Ecohydrological dynamics during a dry period
UT&C is able to quantify the contribution of energy and wa-
ter ﬂuxes from different urban surfaces (impervious, bare and
vegetated ground, sunlit and shaded wall, and impervious
and vegetated roof) and source mechanisms (e.g. ﬂux of wa-
ter vapour from transpiration and canopy interception). The
contribution of latent heat from impervious surfaces (roof
and ground), vegetated ground, and trees to the overall la-
tent heat ﬂux for the simulation time period in Telok Ku-
rau, Singapore, is analysed and shown in Fig. 9. Latent heat
from impervious surfaces is highly variable and depends on
the amount of rain fallen in the previous hours. On the other
hand, latent heat from vegetated ground and trees varies less
and forms the baseline of the total latent heat ﬂux. Of special
interest in this study is the exceptionally dry period observed
between mid-January and mid-March 2014 (Ziegler et al.,
2014). During this period, rain was absent and no latent heat
from impervious surfaces was observed besides a spike on
8 February 2014 related to a small rainfall event of 2.2 mm
on this day. The latent heat from vegetated ground is initially
high but starts to decrease as the dry period persists, while the
latent heat from trees remains constant and high (Fig. 9). This
different behaviour of ground vegetation (grass) and trees can
be explained by the water stress experienced by the different
vegetation types. Plant water stress is modelled as a function
of the overall soil water potential experienced by grass and
tree roots (Fig. 9). In the current parameterization for Singa-
pore, stomata closure due to plant water stress starts at a soil
water potential of −0.5 and −0.9 MPa for grass and trees,
respectively, and stomata closure reaches 50 % at a soil wa-
ter potential of −1.6 and −1.7 MPa. During the dry period
from mid-January to mid-March 2014, the grass experiences
water stress (Fig. 9), which leads to stomata closure and a
decrease in latent heat, while trees experience only moderate
water stress and their transpiration continues at high rates.
This difference in water stress is caused by the grass and tree
root proﬁles, which allows them to access water at different
soil depths. During the dry period, the upper soil layers of
the vegetated soil column dry out, while the deep soil layers
are barely affected by the weather conditions, as shown in
Fig. 10. The grass has only access to the drier top soil layers
(Fig. 10) as 95 % of its roots are shallower than 30 cm, while
trees are able to access the wet deeper soil layers (e.g. from
70 to 175 cm depth; Fig. 10) as their roots are assumed to
reach a depth of 1.5 m (Harshan et al., 2017) (ZR95; Sect. 9
of the TRM). This explicit representation of soil moisture in
different soil layers and the vertical and horizontal root pro-
ﬁle are important to represent the effects of climate and en-
vironment on plant performance. Furthermore, such a mod-
elling solution improves model performance during the dry
period from mid-January to mid-March 2014 in Singapore,
as shown in Sect. 4.1.3 and Fig. 6.
4.3
Singapore sensitivity analysis
4.3.1
Air temperature, relative humidity, and
evapotranspiration
The increase of vegetated ground cover (λG,veg) in Singa-
pore from 0 to 100 % leads to an overall reduction of 2 m
air temperature (T2 m) of 1.1 ◦C, while relative humidity at
2 m (RH2 m) and canyon evapotranspiration (ETcanyon) are
increased by 6.5 % and 1.8 mm d−1, respectively (Figs. 11,
12 and Sect. 10 of the TRM). The daily cycle analysis shows
a larger average decrease of T2 m and increase of RH2 m and
ETcanyon around solar noon with maximum values of 2.2 ◦C
(14:00 LT), 12.9 % (13:00 LT), and 0.33 mm h−1 (13:00 LT),
respectively (Table 4, Figs. 11, 12, and Sect. 10 of the TRM).
The increase of LAI from 0.5 to 5 for vegetated ground
and trees leads to a reduction of T2 m by 0.2 ◦C. The mean
maximum decrease of T2 m is observed at a LAI of 2.5, while
no further decrease occurs at higher values of LAI (Fig. 11).
The overall increase of LAI leads to an increase of RH2 m and
ETcanyon by 2.1 % and 0.7 mm d−1, respectively (Fig. 12 and
Sect. 10 of the TRM). The daily cycle analysis shows small
differences in the decrease of T2 m and increase of RH2 m
throughout the day, with maximum values occurring during
morning and evening hours of 0.3 ◦C (17:00 LT) and 2.7 %
(08:00 LT), respectively (Figs. 11 and 12). On the other hand,
the maximum increase of ETcanyon is observed at solar noon,
with a magnitude of 0.07 mm h−1 (13:00 LT) (Sect. 10 of the
TRM).
The sensitivity to maximum RuBisCO capacity (Vc,max),
as indicative of plant photosynthetic capacity, leads to an av-
erage reduction of T2 m by 0.3 ◦C, an increase of RH2 m by
1.6 %, and ETcanyon by 0.7 mm d−1, respectively (Figs. 11,
12, and Sect. 10 of the TRM). The daily cycle shows a larger
decrease of T2 m and increase of RH2 m and ETcanyon around
solar noon and in the late morning hours with maximum val-
ues of 0.7 ◦C (13:00 LT), 4.2 % (11:00 LT), and 0.09 mm h−1
(13:00 LT), respectively (Table 4, Figs. 11, 12, and Sect. 10
of the TRM).
During the dry period (15 February–16 March 2014), the
mean decrease in T2 m and increase in RH2 m is lower than
the decrease observed considering all weather conditions
(Figs. 11 and 12). This is expected as no irrigation is ap-
plied and the vegetation is water stressed, as described in
Sect. 4.2. A stronger reduction in cooling potential is ob-
tained when modifying LAI and Vc,max as the cooling ef-
fect of these parameters relies on an increase in transpiration
per unit of ground area, which is not possible if soil mois-
ture is not available. At high values of Vc,max, the cooling
effect even further decreases as high transpiration rates dur-
ing a dry period lead to a quick depletion of soil moisture and
a longer period with decreased transpiration afterwards. In-

creasing the vegetated ground cover (λG,veg) is only slightly
less effective during the dry period than over the whole year.
This is explained by the fact that an increase in vegetated
ground cover also increases the total soil moisture available
for transpiration within the canyon even though soil mois-
ture available per unit vegetated ground area does not change
much.
As expected, the largest changes in T2 m, RH2 m, and
ETcanyon are observed when modifying λG,veg, while the in-
crease of LAI and Vc,max leads to alterations of smaller mag-
nitudes. However, the capability of providing a mechanis-
tically constrained quantiﬁcation of these values is a non-
trivial result of the UT&C application and opens the doors to
test various scenarios of urban-green arrangements and types
in various climates. The increase of λG,veg and Vc,max leads to
a steady decrease of T2 m mostly caused by an increase in la-
tent heat. On the other hand, the increase of LAI does not lead
to a steady decrease of T2 m. Mechanisms such as obstruc-
tion to turbulent heat exchange with higher LAI, accounted
for in the parameterization of zero-plane displacement height
and roughness length of the urban canopy (Sect. 3.2 of the
TRM), increased longwave radiation, and light limitation to
photosynthesis start to counteract or limit the beneﬁcial ef-
fects of higher LAI, such as shading and evapotranspiration.
Additionally, the diurnal timing of maximal change is of in-
terest, as higher T2 m reduction during midday, for example,
observed with increasing λG,veg, can be especially beneﬁcial
for outdoor thermal comfort.
4.3.2
Energy and water balance
The increase of vegetated ground cover (λG,veg) from 0 to
100 % leads to a decrease of runoff (Q) by 4.5 mm d−1, while
evapotranspiration (ETcanyon) and deep ground leakage (Lk)
increase by 1.8 and 2.8 mm d−1, respectively (Fig. 13, Ta-
ble 5). These numbers compare with a mean daily rainfall ob-
served during the modelling period of 5.0 mm d−1 (Table 1).
The increase of LAI and maximum RuBisCO capacity
(Vc,max) does not alter runoff signiﬁcantly but slightly in-
creases ETcanyon (0.7 and 0.7 mm d−1) and decreases deep
ground leakage (−0.5 and −0.5 mm d−1) (Fig. 13, Table 5).
As intuitively expected, these results indicate that plant bio-
physical and physiological characteristics are much less ef-
fective in modifying surface runoff production than the frac-
tion of pervious ground. It has to be noted that these results
are dependent on the soil type, in this case a sandy loam with
relatively high hydraulic conductivity.
The increase of ETcanyon and λE caused by the increase
of λG,veg, LAI, and Vc,max leads to a decrease in H, while
Rn and G show very minor changes (Sect. 10 of the TRM
and Table 5). These results are dependent on the albedo of
the vegetation for which a value of 0.27 was chosen, as used
by Harshan et al. (2017) (Sect. 9 of the TRM), which quite a
high value.

Discussion
The model (UT&C v1.0) presented in this study is among the
ﬁrst attempts to include in a systematic way physiological
and biophysical characteristics of vegetation in the solution
of the energy and water budget in the urban environment.
While many studies have analysed the inﬂuence of vegetation
on urban climate, UT&C is uniquely capable of answering
the question of how different vegetation conﬁgurations and
species perform in a given climate.
The inclusion of detailed plant physiological and biophys-
ical characteristics is indeed important to quantify said ef-
fects. An example of model capability is shown through the
sensitivity of simulated 2 m air temperature and 2 m rela-
tive humidity in Singapore to the vegetated ground cover
fraction, LAI, and maximum RuBisCO capacity. The largest
decrease (increase) of air temperature (relative humidity),
when compared to the case without vegetation, is observed
with a fully grass-covered ground that can generate a change

of −2.2 ◦C (+12.9 %) at solar noon and an overall long-
term change of mean air temperature (relative humidity) of
−1.1 ◦C (+6.5 %). A fully vegetated ground cover might be
unrealistic in a normal urban setting but is chosen in this
study to demonstrate the maximum expected effect caused
by this intervention and therefore its physical limit as a heat
mitigation strategy. LAI and maximum RuBisCO capacity
show an air temperature and relative humidity modiﬁcation
of much lower magnitude. It is further observed that the in-
crease of maximum RuBisCO capacity leads to a steady de-
crease (increase) of air temperature (relative humidity) be-
cause it does not affect plant structure. Modifying LAI trig-
gers mechanisms, such as changes in radiation exchange,
light limitations of photosynthesis within dense canopy, and
hindering of turbulent energy exchanges, which do not lead
to a further air temperature reduction once a LAI of 2.5 is
exceeded in a low-rise setting in the climate of Singapore.
These results show that UT&C is sensitive and able to ac-
count for multiple effects of vegetation on the local urban
climate. It has to be noted that relative humidity is depen-
dent on the water holding capacity of air at a certain tem-
perature, and the relative humidity increase reported here is
also dependent on air temperature changes. Nevertheless, the
magnitude of relative humidity is important as it inﬂuences
OTC and might reduce the positive effect of decreasing air
temperature.
The results obtained for a low-rise neighbourhood of Sin-
gapore, a hot, humid, tropical city, show that maximum urban
greening can lead to a non-negligible decrease in air tempera-
ture at screen level (2 m) during some hours but will unlikely
be able to mitigate the UHI effect on its own. Higher magni-
tudes of urban cooling due to urban vegetation are reported,
for example, by Wang et al. (2018) in the contiguous United
States where tree shading reduces near-surface air tempera-
ture by 3.06 ◦C and by Middel et al. (2015) in Phoenix where
a moderate increase in tree cover can decrease average ur-
ban air temperature by 2.0 ◦C. This is consistent with the
global analysis performed by Manoli et al. (2019) showing
that the cooling potential of urban vegetation is lower in the
tropics. Higher air temperature decrease in drier climates is
often linked to urban irrigation, as shown by Broadbent et al.
(2018b) in Mawson Lakes in Adelaide, where irrigation dur-
ing a heat wave can reduce average air temperature by up to
2.3 ◦C. In dry climates, however, the trade-off between tem-

perature reduction potential of urban vegetation and water
use through irrigation needs to be considered to fully assess
the feasibility of such a mitigation strategy (Yang and Wang,
2017; Wang et al., 2019).
The increase in green cover is shown to be more effective
in reducing 2 m air temperature and ground surface runoff
production than the change in plant types. While changes in
urban air temperature and humidity caused by a change in
plant physiological and biophysical characteristics are minor
in the current analysis in the Singapore climate, their inclu-
sion in urban canopy modelling is very important, as it allows
quantiﬁcation of the order of magnitude of predicted changes
and helps to deﬁne reasonable expectations of urban planners
and landscape designers using vegetation to mitigate the UHI
or to improve OTC.
The explicit inclusion of ecohydrology and subsurface hy-
drology in urban canopy modelling leads to an improved
simulation during dry-down periods, as shown in Singapore.
This is of particular interest as dry periods may increase
in many cities in the future (Bastin et al., 2019) and allow
UT&C to analyse the response of urban vegetation under dif-
ferent climate scenarios. Furthermore, UT&C is potentially
more accurate in predicting relative humidity at pedestrian
level given its more comprehensive inclusion of soil and veg-
etation processes. This is important to analyse the combined
effects of air temperature and relative humidity alterations
caused by the urban fabric and urban vegetation on the out-
door thermal comfort of city dwellers, which represent one
target application of UT&C.
Future studies could focus on the application of UT&C to
analyse different types of urban greening to produce guide-
lines for urban planners and landscape designers. Possible
areas of interest are the study of the effect of urban plant
types in different climates, the analysis of various urban den-
sities, a systematic evaluation of urban irrigation practices, as
well as the partition of the vegetation role in shade provision
versus evapotranspiration cooling in controlling OTC.

Model limitations
The current version of UT&C does not yet include snow
hydrology and hence should not be used to investigate the
effects of vegetation during winter in cities with snow-
dominated climates. Further UT&C developments can also
focus on the inclusion of tree shading onto roofs and green
walls, and on seasonal vegetation dynamics and vegetation
phenology, as in the original T&C model, rather than using a
prescribed LAI as currently done.

Future model performance assessment should also focus
on a more extensive use of 2 m canyon air temperature, 2 m
canyon humidity, and surface temperature data, as the com-
parison presented here with air temperature in Singapore and
ground temperature in Phoenix only gives an indication of
model performance, as these variables are highly location
speciﬁc and potentially not representative of the whole foot-
print areas below the ﬂux towers modelled here. Addition-
ally, the validation data from low-rise urban climate zones
offer only a partial picture of urban conditions, and further
validations could focus on high-rise and dense urban settings.
A couple of notable behaviours that were observed during
model development and assessment are that the prescribed
interior building temperature can inﬂuence the urban canyon
air temperature, especially in narrow canyons, and hence re-
alistic time series of interior building temperature are fun-
damental to obtain accurate results (see Sect. 5 of the TRM).
Furthermore, it was observed during model development that
latent heat variability and peaks are highly dependent on the
maximum ponding storage capacity of the impervious sur-
face. The maximum ponding storage capacity of impervious
surfaces is difﬁcult to estimate in the highly heterogeneous
urban environment, which contains smooth surfaces but also
micro-depressions due to its complex geometry and may re-
quire innovative ways of observing it to constrain model pa-
rameterizations (Wouters et al., 2015).

Conclusions
This study introduces the urban ecohydrological model, Ur-
ban Tethys-Chloris (UT&C), and provides a technical de-
scription of its components, an assessment of model perfor-
mance against three different case studies, and a sensitivity
analysis to illustrate the model capabilities. UT&C is a fully
coupled energy and water balance model that calculates 2 m
air temperature, 2 m humidity, urban surface temperatures,
and all components of the energy and water balance, includ-
ing surface runoff. UT&C includes a detailed representation
of plant biophysical and ecophysiological characteristics. It
is able to account for the effects of different plant types and
urban-green typologies on the local microclimate and water
ﬂuxes. In turn, it can also provide information on how the ur-
ban environment affects plant well-being and performance.
The model was assessed against eddy-covariance mea-
surements in Singapore, Melbourne, and Phoenix, often
showing better performance in terms of model validation
indices compared to existing models for these three cities.
UT&C shows a clear advantage in periods of water stress, as
it solves in detail soil hydrological dynamics and can account
for different root proﬁles of urban vegetation and its access to
soil moisture as shown for the dry-down period in Singapore.
Explicitly resolving subsurface hydrology and including
plant biophysical and ecophysiological characteristics allow
the analysis of plant performance under water-limiting con-
ditions. Hence, UT&C is especially suited for arid and semi-
arid climates where urban irrigation is or will be applied.
Furthermore, UT&C has a low computational demand and
allows for analyses spanning multiple years with an hourly
or sub-hourly time step, thus facilitating long-term and sea-
sonal studies testing multiple scenarios. Hence, UT&C can
assess plant performance under different existing and future
climatic conditions, for example, during droughts and re-
sponses to increasing temperature, or test the effectiveness
of various irrigation practices.
Code and data availability. The development of UT&C, model
validation, and graphs presented in this paper were conducted in
MATLAB R2018b. The exact version of UT&C used to produce the
results used in this paper is archived on Zenodo (Meili and Fatichi,
2019). The original source code for the ecohydrological model
Tethys-Chloris was obtained from the author (Fatichi et al., 2012a,
b), while the building and tree-shading calculations are based on the
code of Ryu et al. (2016). The tower-based eddy-covariance mea-
surements used for model validation were obtained from the au-
thors in Telok Kurau, Singapore (Velasco et al., 2013; Roth et al.,
2016), and in Preston, Melbourne (Coutts et al., 2007a, b; Nice
et al., 2018), and from the Global Institute of Sustainability, Ari-
zona State University (ASU), in Maryvale, Phoenix (Chow et al.,
2014; Chow, 2017).
