Abstract
Background: Mental health problems are common in the work force and influence work capacity and sickness
absence. The aim was to examine self-assessed mental health problems and work capacity as determinants of time
until return to work (RTW).
Methods: Employed women and men (n=6140), aged 19–64 years, registered as sick with all-cause sickness
absence between February 18 and April 15, 2008 received a self-administered questionnaire covering health and
work situation (response rate 54%). Demographic data was collected from official registers. This follow-up study
included 2502 individuals. Of these, 1082 were currently off sick when answering the questionnaire. Register data
on total number of benefit compensated sick-leave days in the end of 2008 were used to determine the time until
RTW. Self-reported persistent mental illness, the WHO (Ten) Mental Well-Being Index and self-assessed work capacity
in relation to knowledge, mental, collaborative and physical demands at work were used as determinants.
Multinomial and binary logistic regression analyses were used to estimate odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals
(CI) for the likelihood of RTW.
Results: The likelihood of RTW (≥105 days) was higher among those with persistent mental illness OR= 2.97 (95%
CI, 2.10-4.20) and those with low mental well-being OR= 2.89 (95% CI, 2.31-3.62) after adjusting for gender, age,
SES, hours worked and sick leave 2007. An analysis of employees who were off sick when they answered the
questionnaire, the likelihood of RTW (≥105 days) was higher among those who reported low capacity to work in
relation to knowledge, mental, collaborative and physical demands at work. In a multivariable analysis, the
likelihood of RTW (≥105 days) among those with low mental well-being remained significant OR=1.93 (95% CI
1.46-2.55) even after adjustment for all dimensions of capacity to work.
Conclusion: Self-assessed persistent mental illness, low mental well-being and low work capacity increased the
likelihood of prolonged RTW. This study is unique because it is based on new sick-leave spells and is the first to
show that low mental well-being was a strong determinant of RTW even after adjustment for work capacity. Our
findings support the importance of identifying individuals with low mental well-being as a way to promote RTW.

Background
Among the factors that can negatively affect capacity to
work, mental health problems play a significant part.
They are common in the general population and even
minor illnesses can influence the capacity to work to a
great extent [1-4]. Common mental disorders (CMD) is
an encompassing term for mild to moderate depression,
anxiety disorders and mental exhaustion/burnout includ-
ing subthreshold symptoms. CMD is often associated with
significant dysfunction and disability and co-morbidity is
common. CMD have been found to have a stronger im-
pact on sickness absence and work impairment than
breathing disorders, back/neck disorders, arthritis, dia-
betes and heart disease [2,4,5].
Several studies have examined the role of CMD in the
process of return to work (RTW). Brouwers et al. [6]
found that a long duration of mental health problems be-
fore the start of sick leave caused by minor mental disor-
ders and a long duration of sick leave before inclusion in
the study reduced the probability of RTW within 3
months. High levels of somatization and anxiety at base-
line and depression after 3 months reduced the probability
of RTW even further [6]. In another Dutch study, Brouwer
et al. [7] found that the only factor that remained signifi-
cantly associated with time until RTW among those with
mental health problems was willingness to expend effort
in completing behaviour (adjusted for gender, age, level
of education, time to identification by the occupational
health service, intensity of medical condition causing the
sick leave, and perceived social support). In a prospective
study involving a multivariable analysis of time to RTW,
Vlasveld et al. [8] found that 71% of the workers initially
off sick had returned to full RTW within 1 year. High
physical job demands, contact with medical specialists,
high level of physical symptoms, moderate to severe de-
pressive symptoms and older age were associated with
prolonged sick leave. In 2012, Roelen et al. [9] found that
the association between mental health problems and
RTW varied between different mental disorders. In a sys-
tematic and comprehensive review, Cornelius et al. [10]
found strong evidence that age >50 years prolonged the
time off work. Limited evidence was found for any associ-
ations between other individual factors, such as gender,
education, history of previous sickness absence, negative
recovery expectation and socioeconomic status, and dis-
ability and time off work. Health-related factors (stress,
shoulder/back pain and depression/anxiety disorder) and
job-related factors (unemployment, quality and continuity
of occupational care and supervisor behaviour) were
also associated with increased disability and slow RTW.
Cornelius et al. [10] concluded that there is a need for fur-
ther research, particularly prospective cohort studies.
An important aspect of RTW is work capacity. Work
capacity, or work ability which also is a common term,
can be understood as the individual’s capacity to do his/
her work with respect to the demands at work, given a
certain health status and mental resources [11]. Thus,
there is an interaction between the individual and his/her
work environment. It can be seen as a dynamic relation-
ship between the individual and different aspects of the
work environment including work tasks [12]. However,
none of the studies mentioned earlier included measures
of work capacity. From a clinical perspective and to iden-
tify individuals in need of specific support or treatment at
an early stage, it is important to know the determinants of
time until RTW. Thus, the aim of this general population-
based, prospective cohort study was to examine self-assessed
mental health problems and work capacity as determinants
of time until RTW.
Methods
Study design and participants
This prospective cohort study is part of the Health Assets
Project [13,14]. The study base was the region of Västra
Götaland in southwest Sweden with a population of 1.6
million (17% of the Swedish population). The region in-
cludes both urban and rural areas. The target population
included individuals aged from 19 to 64 years.
Individuals who became sick-listed with a new period
of sick leave at the Swedish Social Insurance Agency be-
tween February 18 and April 15, 2008, irrespective of
the reasons for the sick leave (all-cause sickness absence)
were identified as a relevant study population. The time
period were chosen to avoid seasonal variations where
sickness absence in Sweden is increased due to influenza
periods or decreased due to summer vacation. The
chosen months represented the annual mean. During
the time period of inclusion a total number of 12, 543
individuals became sick-listed. Of these 49% (n=6140)
were reported as off sick by their employer and regis-
tered as such at the Swedish Social Insurance Agency
between the February 18 and April 15, 2008. This group
was invited to the study and they all received a question-
naire. The remaining 51% (n=6403) became sick-listed
during the same period but were either not reported by
their employer as off sick or not registered as off sick by
the Swedish Social Insurance Agency (or both) until
after April 15, 2008. Those who were registered at a later
date were not invited to participate in this questionnaire
study, because we aimed to distribute the questionnaire
as close as possible to the actual sick-leave period.
Among those registered after April 15 and thus not in-
cluded in this study, there was a higher proportion of
men, individuals with low income, highly educated, first
time sick-listed and immigrants, according to oral infor-
mation from the Department for Statistics and Analysis
at the Swedish Social Insurance Agency.

Postal questionnaires to the group (n=6140) registered
between February 18 and April 15, 2008 were distributed
by Statistics Sweden at base line (2008) and two reminders
followed [15]. The response rate was 54% (n=3310). Sig-
nificantly higher dropout rates were found among per-
sons who were young (aged 19–30 years), single, born
outside Sweden and those reporting low annual income
(≤SEK149,000/year which corresponds to approximately
17,380 EURO). In urban areas, women were more likely to
drop out than men. The proportion of women (66%) and
men (34%) among those who responded to the question-
naire was similar to that observed for sickness absence in
the general population of the country as a whole [16].
Of those who decided to participate by answering the
questionnaire (54%, n=3310) we included in this follow-up
study individuals with only a single sick-leave spell by the
end of 2008 and who stated in the questionnaire that they
were employed (n1=2502). Register data on sickness ab-
sence was followed until the end of 2008. Sickness absence
is dynamic in the sense that individuals move in and out
of the state of being off sick. In this study, there was, by
necessity, a delay between the start of the inclusion period
and the date of completion of the postal questionnaire.
Thus, in the second part of this study we included only
those who stated that they were currently on sick leave at
the time of answering the questionnaire (n2=1802) to be
sure that self-assessment of work capacity was done during
a sick leave episode among all participants. This sub sample
(n2) did not differ from the larger sample (n1) or from the
original sample (n=3310) with regard to socio-demographic
factors included. There were a higher proportion of individ-
uals with persistent mental illness and with low mental
wellbeing in the sub sample (n2) compared to the larger
sample (n1) but this was expected since individuals with
mental health problems have an increased risk for longer
periods off work. Thus, in any sample followed over time
the proportion with mental illness will increase.
Social insurance in Sweden
In Sweden, sickness absence insurance covers all inhabi-
tants of working age. During the study period, sickness
benefit amounted to approximately 80% of lost income up
to a certain level. Sickness benefit can be granted to those
who have impaired work capacity due to disease or injury.
There is no economic reimbursement for the first qualify-
ing day. The initial 7 days in a sick-leave spell are self-
certified. After that, a medical certificate is required. Sick
pay is covered by the employer for the first 14 days of a
sick-leave spell. Thereafter, sick-leave benefit is granted
from the Swedish Social Insurance Agency.
Outcome: time until RTW
In this study, time until RTW was measured by estimat-
ing the number of sick-leave days for which sickness
benefit was paid in 2008. Information on an individual’s
annual number of sick-leave spells and number of benefit-
compensated sick-leave days was collected from the longi-
tudinal integrated database for sickness insurance and
labour market research (LISA), held by Statistics Sweden.
The total number of benefit-compensated sick-leave days
in 2008 was divided into three groups: ≤14 days (n=996),
15–90 days (n=913) and ≥91 days (n=593). All participants
had an initial 14-day period compensated by sick pay from
the employer, therefore the total number of actual sick-
leave days was by adding 14 days per person. Thus, the
final definitions of RTW were early (≤28 days), medium
late (29–104 days) and late (≥105 days). Early RTW was
chosen as a relevant category in line with several other
studies, given the fact that all participants had at least 2
weeks off work as part of the inclusion criteria [6,17,18].
Medium late RTW was harmonized with the Swedish sick-
ness insurance regulation whereby there is an obligatory as-
sessment of the individual’s work capacity in relation to
available work tasks at the work place at 3 months. Late
RTW was defined so that enough individuals were included
to allow relevant statistical analyses and was not divided
into further categories. In the analysis of the subpopulation
currently on sick leave, time until RTW was treated as a
binary outcome: early/medium late (≤104 days) versus late
RTW (≥105 days). This dichotomization was done due to
the smaller number of individuals.
Indicators of mental health problems
Two self-reported indicators of mental health problems
were used. Respondents were asked whether they had any
persistent disease, illness or disability, followed by a check-
list of disease categories. Those who ticked “mental ill-
ness” were considered to have persistent mental illness.
This question, which has been used extensively in different
public health surveys in Sweden, has shown good validity
and reliability [19]. Mental well-being was assessed using
the WHO (Ten) Mental Well-Being Index, which has
been used in several population-based studies with accept-
able validity and reliability [20-22]. In comparisons with
clinical interviews using the Schedules for Clinical Assess-
ment in Neuropsychiatry, the WHO (Ten) Mental Well-
Being Index was found to be more likely to identify need
of care and psychiatric diagnoses than the other instru-
ments [23,24]. The index measures mental well-being dur-
ing the previous week and includes one item on depression
and anxiety, two items on energy and six items on positive
well-being. Response alternatives to each item are always,
often, sometimes and never. The maximum score is 30
points, and higher scores indicate higher mental well-being.
In the current study, we computed the cut-off based on the
lower quartile in a general population cohort available in
the Health Assets Project. Thus, the cut-off was not com-
puted on the population included in the present study
Hensing et al. BMC Psychiatry 2013, 13:259

because that consists of sick-listed individuals and the dis-
tribution might be skewed. The cut-off was chosen to cap-
ture enough exposure differences, without having to
compare the extremes. Two status categories were created,
namely low mental well-being (scores ≤12) and high mental
well-being (scores ≥13). The mental health variables over-
lapped; among those reporting persistent mental illness
(n1) 71% had low mental well-being and of those reporting
low mental well-being 22% stated persistent mental illness.
Self-assessed work capacity
Work capacity was measured by an initial question and
four separate items reflecting different aspects of work
capacity: “How do you rate your current work ability with
respect to knowledge, mental, collaborative and physical
demands of your work?” (each item assessed separately).
The mental and physical demands items were derived
from the Work Ability Index (WAI) [25]. Psychometric
evaluation of the WAI has shown that these two items
correlate highly with the total index [26]. The knowledge
demands item was derived from the Copenhagen Psycho-
social Questionnaire [27]. The collaborative demands item
was developed by the research group [28,29]. Response al-
ternatives for each item were very good, rather good, mod-
erate, rather poor and very poor. Response alternatives
were dichotomized into high work capacity (very good
and rather good) and low work capacity (moderate, rather
poor, very poor). Dichotomization was done mainly to at-
tain analytical power in subgroups. The correlation be-
tween physical work capacity and the other work capacity
variables was in each comparison below r=0.40. The cor-
relation between mental work capacity and work capacity
related to knowledge demands was r=0.53. The correla-
tions between collaborative work capacity and mental and
knowledge work capacity were r=0.60 and r=0.52. All cor-
relations were significant at the 0.01 level (Spearman’s
correlation).
Confounders
Data on gender, age, socioeconomic status (SES), and total
number of sick-leave days during the calendar year 2007
were obtained from national registers. Age was catego-
rized into three groups: 19–30, 31–50 and 51–64 years.
SES was defined according to a classification system used
by Statistics Sweden, which is based on occupation [30].
Each person was assigned to one of three groups: high
non manual, intermediate/low non manual and skilled/un-
skilled manual/self-employed. Previous sick leave was de-
fined as having at least one sick-leave day with benefit
from the National Insurance Agency during the year be-
fore inclusion (2007). This implies a period of at least 15
days of sick leave according to the Swedish insurance sys-
tem, because shorter periods are registered by the em-
ployers only. Data on marital status, educational level and
hours worked were obtained from the questionnaire.
Marital status was grouped into married/cohabiting or sin-
gle. Educational level was categorized as up to primary (9
years or less), upper secondary (10–12 years) and higher
education (>12 years). Hours worked were categorized
into full-time and part-time (at least 15 hours/week).
Because there is a high comorbidity between mental
health problems and alcohol problems, a separate analysis
was made [31]. The associations between mental health
problems and alcohol problems were analysed by using
Pearson's chi2 with the significance level set at p<0.05. As
an indicator of harmful alcohol habits, the Swedish version
of the WHO’s recommended questionnaire the AUDIT
(Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) was used [32].
Significant associations were found between AUDIT scores,
persistent mental illness and low mental well-being. How-
ever, AUDIT scores were not significantly associated with
RTW in any of the stratification groups: age, gender, per-
sistent mental illness and low mental well-being (results
not shown). Harmful alcohol habits (AUDIT scores) were
thus not included in any further analysis.
The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Re-
view Board of the University of Gothenburg, Sweden
(no. 039–08).
Statistical analyses
For the WHO (Ten) Mental Well-Being Index, 198 indi-
viduals (7.9% of the study population) had missing values
for at least one item. Those who had missing values on all
items (n=5) were excluded; missing data for the remaining
individuals (n=193) were replaced by mode imputation at
each item to increase power [33]. After imputation, the
proportion reporting high or low mental well-being did
not change in the study population or in the subpopula-
tion of those currently off sick.
Multinomial logistic regression was used (n=2502) to
estimate crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR) with 95%
confidence intervals (CI) for likelihood of time until
RTW (as categorical outcome) with respect to independ-
ent variables. Despite non significance in the bivariate
analyses, gender and SES were included in the multivari-
able analyses because of their known strong association
with both mental health problems and sickness absence.
Binary logistic regressions were performed (n=1082)
to estimate crude and adjusted (age, gender, persistent
mental illness, low mental well-being) ORs with 95%
CIs for late RTW (as a binary outcome) in relation to
knowledge, mental, physical and collaborative work
capacity among the subpopulation of those currently
off sick. Other independent covariates were not in-
cluded due to non significant association with late
RTW or work capacity variables (results not shown).
The group reporting high work capacity was used as
reference category.

Results
Determinants of RTW
The characteristics of the study population and associa-
tions with RTW are presented in Table 1. No significant
differences in RTW were found between men and women.
Among men, 40% had an early, 38% had a medium late
(29–104 days) and 22% a late (≥105 days) RTW (Table 1);
the corresponding figures for women were 40%, 36% and
24%. The two older age groups had increased odds for late
RTW compared with those aged 19–30 years but no dif-
ferences were found for medium late RTW. A larger pro-
portion of those working part-time had a late RTW
compared with those working full-time (OR 1.39, 95% CI
1.11–1.74).
Sickness absence days in 2007 were associated with
medium late RTW (OR=1.32, 95% CI 1.06–1.65) and
late RTW (OR=1.60, 95% CI 1.26–2.04). Self-reported
persistent mental illness (OR= 2.97, 95% CI 2.13–4.15)
and low mental well-being (OR 2.96, 95% CI 2.38–3.68)
were significantly associated with late RTW but not

with medium late RTW. No significant associations
with medium late or late RTW were found for marital
status, educational level and SES.
The association between persistent mental illness and
late RTW remained significant after adjustment for
other covariates (Table 2). The same was the case for the
association with low mental well-being. The strongest
association was found between persistent mental illness
and late RTW (OR=2.97, 95% CI 2.10–4.20).
Work capacity as a determinant of RTW among
employees currently off sick
Among those who currently were off sick (see methods
section) when responding to the questionnaire, 54% of the
men and 55% of women had a late RTW. In each of the
four work capacity dimensions, those who rated their cap-
acity to work as low had higher odds of late RTW com-
pared with those with high work capacity (Table 3).
Among individuals with low work capacity, the age- and
gender-adjusted OR of late RTW was 2.06 (95% CI 1.44–
2.95) in relation to knowledge demands, 1.93 (95% CI
1.47–2.53) for mental demands, 2.04 (95% CI 1.49–2.79)
for collaborative demands and 1.53 (95% CI 1.19–1.97)
for physical demands. After adjustment for persistent
mental illness, ORs were reduced for each dimension but
remained significant (Table 3).
Although ORs were further reduced in the model
adjusting for low mental well-being, associations remained
significant. However, when all the different work capacity
dimensions were included in the final model, the associa-
tions became non significant.
Mental health problems as determinants of RTW among
employees currently off sick
The proportion with late RTW was 38% (n=41) among
those aged 19–30 years, 56% (n=267) among those aged
31–50 years and 56% among those aged 51–64 years
(n=280). The likelihood for late RTW among the two
older age groups compared with the youngest was OR
2.04 (95% CI 1.33–3.13) and OR 2.08 (95% CI 1.35–3.19),
respectively.
Odds for late RTW were higher among those with per-
sistent mental illness (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.21–2.52) also
after adjusting for age and gender. An adjustment was
made for each of the four dimensions of work capacity
and odds were reduced (Table 4). The adjustment for
mental work capacity led to a non significant OR and for
collaborative work capacity, the OR was just above the sig-
nificance level. When all four dimensions of capacity to
work were included in the model, the association between
persistent mental illness and late RTW became non sig-
nificant (Table 4). Among those with low mental well-
being, the OR for late RTW was 2.18 (95% CI 1.69–2.82)
after adjusting for age and gender. The same procedure
was used here and adjustment for each dimension of work
capacity was made separately. This yielded only minor
changes in the ORs. A significant two-fold increase in
odds was noted in all cases. After adjustment for all cap-
acity to work dimensions the likelihood for late RTW
among employees with low mental well-being was still in-
creased (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.46–2.55).
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
examine both mental health problems and work capacity
in relation to RTW in a general population-based cohort
of employees off sick due to all-cause sickness absence.
Low mental well-being was a strong determinant with a
near three-fold increase in odds of late RTW in the ad-
justed model. Similar odds were found in a separate model
assessing the relationship between self-reported persistent
mental illness and RTW. Another important finding was
that each of the four work capacity dimensions (know-
ledge, mental, collaborative and physical) predicted late
RTW also in models adjusted for age, gender, persistent
mental illness and low mental well-being, respectively.
Somewhat unexpectedly, low mental well-being remained

a significant determinant of late RTW after adjustment for
all four work capacity dimensions.
Determinants of RTW
We found that individuals who reported persistent men-
tal illness had a higher likelihood of late RTW. Our
study lacks specific diagnostic information, but it can be
assumed that many of those with self-reported persistent
mental illness had anxiety and/or depressive disorders.
Individuals in this study were initially off sick and the
disease that led to the sick-leave episode might have trig-
gered a relapse or worsening of mental illness. Further-
more, individuals with persistent mental illness might be
more vulnerable to strain associated with the sick-leave
episode, be it health or work related. Conditions at work
might influence RTW and several studies have shown
that mental illness is associated with stigma [34]. It is
possible that individuals with mental illness refrain from
disclosing their problems and this might reduce the ac-
cess to vocational support needed in the RTW process
[34]. It is well known from previous studies that individ-
uals with mental health problems to a large extent go
unidentified at both primary health care centres and spe-
cialized medical clinics [35,36]. From the current study,
it is not clear whether persistent mental illness was
detected or not. A medical consultation is a prerequisite
for sickness benefit after 7 days, and all individuals in
this study were thus seen by a doctor. However, the ex-
tent to which symptoms of CMD were identified and
treated could not be determined in our study. In one of
the few studies estimating undetected CMD in a national
register of all-cause long-term sickness absence (exceed-
ing 8 weeks), Soegaard [36] found that, among individ-
uals without any psychiatric sick-leave diagnosis, 19.9%
had undetected depression and 6.4% had undetected
anxiety symptoms [36].
A more unexpected finding was that even after adjust-
ment for all dimensions of capacity to work, low mental
well-being was associated with late RTW. A Swedish
population-based study concluded that very mild psycho-
logical distress at baseline, measured by the General
Health Questionnaire (GHQ 12), had a hazard ratio of 1.7
for a disability pension for a somatic reason and a hazard
ratio of 2.2 for a disability pension with a psychiatric rea-
son 5 years later [37]. Our study has a shorter follow-up
period, but the findings are in the same direction. Thus, it
seems important to identify low mental well-being to
avoid lingering absence and, in the longer-term perspec-
tive, disability pensions. In psychiatric research, it has been
suggested that well-being is an important complement to
diagnostic procedures of symptoms because it has higher
relevance to an individual’s quality of life, and it may better
capture recovery or subclinical symptoms [35,38,39].
Our study sample consisted of individuals off sick
with all-cause sickness absence and low mental well-
being might be secondary to severe acute or chronic
disorders such as injuries, circulatory diseases or neo-
plasms. Psychiatric disorders constituted the most com-
mon diagnostic group among sick-listed women in
Sweden in 2008, accounting for 33% of all cases of sick-
ness absence. In men, psychiatric disorders were the
second most common diagnostic group, and they
accounted for 23% of all cases [16]. The diagnostic
panorama changes as the sick-leave periods become
longer because most individuals with infectious diseases
and injuries return to work at a faster pace. Thus, the
study population is mixed over all diagnostic groups
and
this
needs
to
be
taken
into
account
when
interpreting the findings. It is likely that physicians
identify low mental well-being more easily in individuals
who primarily seek care for mental symptoms, and less
easily in individuals who primarily seek care for other
causes. Work capacity regarding knowledge, mental,
collaborative and physical demands predicted RTW in
our study. There are no previous studies that can pro-
vide data for direct comparison.
In a clinical population from primary and occupational
health care, Reiso et al. [17] used a single question: “to
what degree is your ability to perform your ordinary, re-
munerative work reduced today?”. They found that indi-
viduals who reported that their ability to perform work
was very much reduced had significantly prolonged sick-
ness absence at follow-up at 1 and 3 months. The single
question “current work ability compared with life-time
best” was used in a study investigating RTW in a cohort
of newly sick-listed patients in primary and occupational
health care [18]. Patients with musculoskeletal disorders
and those with mental disorders improved their work
ability assessments but significant association with RTW
was found only for those with musculoskeletal disorders
[18]. This is in line with our findings that low mental
well-being was a strong determinant for late RTW. On
the other hand, it might be that work capacity assess-
ments are more complex both in the clinical setting and
as self-assessments. A recent qualitative study explored
the capacity to work while depressed and anxious and
identified a dynamic and varying capacity related both
to fluctuations in symptoms and to work tasks and work
environment. Even the social environment and life out-
side work were highlighted as important for the capacity
to work [40]. New instruments or items need to be
developed to better capture the complexity of the
phenomenon in a population-based study but probably
also in the clinical setting. Niewenhuijsen et al. [41]
concluded in a review that there was a lack of function-
ing instruments detecting the very specific deficits in
mental disorders.

Practice implications
The clinical implications from this study should be
regarded from a sickness absence perspective. It might be
important to develop easily administered screening ques-
tions to identify individuals in need of more intense inter-
ventions with the aim of reducing time to RTW. Several
future studies are needed but, from this study, it seems
more important to screen for mental well-being than for
work capacity assessment. The length of sickness absence
should be adapted to the individual resources and work
demands and, in some cases, a longer period of absence is
needed, relevant and well-motivated. However, to be sick-
listed might lead to negative and unwanted consequences
such
as
reduced
work
motivation,
social
isolation,
stigmatization, changed self-image, economic strain and
secondary health problems. National sickness insurance
regulations must also be considered and the way they
might affect individuals on prolonged sick leave. In
Sweden, for example, a new and stricter sickness insur-
ance regulation means that after 3 months sick leave, a
work place transfer to another job at the same employer
but with lesser demands must take place. After 6 months
of sick leave, if the person cannot return to work, a new
job on the open labour market is the alternative. Regula-
tions like this increase the pressure on the individual and
the employer to make work possible and there is a large
responsibility also for the health care to be efficient and
professional in support of sick-listed individuals. Early
identification of mental health problems is an important
component in this process.
Methodological considerations
The strengths of this study are the selection of a general
population-based consecutive sample of newly sick-listed
individuals obtained from national registers, the use of
two different questions to capture mental health problems,
and the inclusion of different dimensions of work capacity.
The outcome measure, RTW, was prospective and the
register data were of high quality.
There are some limitations to discuss. Different types of
bias can occur from self-assessed measurements including
social desirability, recall bias and responses biased by
symptoms associated with mental health problems (e.g.
depression). Validated and recommended instruments
have been used for the measurement of health-related var-
iables [20,24]. The validity of the WHO (Ten) Mental
Well-Being Scale was tested in the PART project; a
population-based study from Sweden found that the
WHO (Ten) Mental Well-Being Index was more likely to
identify individuals in need of care and psychiatric diagno-
sis compared with diagnostic questionnaires on CMD,
which were seen as too inclusive [24]. Mental and physical
capacity to work was measured by validated instruments
[25,42]. However, knowledge and collaborative work
capacity items were developed within the project and have
not been tested for validity. Even though the associations
were similar to those found for mental and physical work
capacity, we cannot claim that these new constructs are
equally valid. It can be argued that social desirability
played a role in the assessments of collaborative work cap-
acity; the second lowest proportion reporting low work
capacity was found for this dimension. It is likely that an
overestimation of one’s own capacity to collaborate is
more common than an underestimation. Regarding mem-
ory and symptom bias, it can be argued that individuals
with CMD might undervalue their capacities to a greater
extent than the mentally healthy. However, the findings in
this study were quite strong and remained significant even
after adjustments, so even though there might be a slight
overestimation of a specific OR, the direction would be
the same with some changes in the level of estimations of,
for example, capacity to work.
There was some dropout in the first phase of inclusion
in this study. Not all individuals who actually became
sick-listed between February 18 and April 15, 2008, were
registered as off sick during that period. In our study,
49% were included, which is a large proportion of the
target population. Multivariable analyses controlling for
possible confounders such as gender, educational level,
SES, and total number of sick-leave days during the year
before to the index episode were done as a way to man-
age any bias related to overrepresentation of certain
groups among those registered after April 15.
There was also a systematic dropout in the question-
naire study and the estimates need to be interpreted
with this in mind. The dropout was higher among youn-
ger persons. From a sick-leave perspective, this means
that a group with low risk for long-term sick leave had a
higher dropout rate. The proportion for early RTW
might have been higher if the age-related dropout had
not occurred. On the other hand, young individuals with
mental health problems might have more problems re-
lated to the capacity to work than older individuals due
to their lack of experience of work life. However, this
would strengthen the overall association between RTW
and persistent mental illness and low mental well-being
rather than attenuate it. The lower representation of im-
migrants most likely led to an underestimation of associ-
ations because mental health problems can be expected
to be higher in that group compared with nonmigrants.
The internal dropouts in the WHO (Ten) Mental
Well-Being Index were replaced by imputation and the
variable was analysed in several ways. Although there
was no systemic dropout regarding any of the specific
items, missing data were more prevalent for the WHO
(Ten) Mental Well-Being Scale compared with questions
using the Likert scale that was placed both immediately
before and after the well-being index. This indicates that
Hensing et al. BMC Psychiatry 2013, 13:259
Page 10 of 12
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-244X/13/259
questions regarding mental health are sensitive and the
missing data were not missing at random [43]. Through
imputation, the sample size was increased. The propor-
tions reporting high and low mental well-being before
and after imputation did not change but a bias might
have been introduced due to possible misclassification.
We do not have any information on dropout regarding
work capacity but it can be expected that individuals with
low mental work capacity refrain to a higher degree from
participation in a questionnaire study with a large number
of cognitively demanding questions [44]. If this is the case,
the proportions reporting low work capacity might be low
in comparison with the true distribution.
The choice of confounders in this study was mainly
based on earlier research on CMD and sickness absence.
It is well known that both vary with age, gender, education,
socioeconomic position, marital status; and for sickness
absence, also with hours worked and earlier sickness ab-
sence. An initial bivariate analysis of the associations be-
tween these variables and RTW was done and in most
cases the non significant variables were excluded from
further analyses. However, the basic covariate and gender
were included even though the associations were non-
significant in the bivariate analyses to keep these factors
under control in different sub analyses.
Conclusions
In this study, self-assessed persistent mental illness, low
mental well-being and four dimensions of low work cap-
acity increased the likelihood of late RTW in persons on
all-cause sickness absence. This study is unique because it
is based on new sick-leave spells and is the first to show
that low mental well-being was an important determinant
of late RTW even after adjustment for work capacity. Our
findings support the importance of identifying individuals
with low mental well-being as a way to prevent late RTW.
