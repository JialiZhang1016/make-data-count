Abstract 
Ruminal thiamine deficiencies occur when dairy cows are overfed with high-concentrate diet, and thiamine supple-
mentation has been proved to attenuate high-concentrate diet induced SARA. However, there is limited knowledge 
of the relationship between thiamine supplementation in high-concentrate diets and ruminal fungi. In order to inves-
tigate the impacts of thiamine supplementation on ruminal fungi, twelve Chinese Holstein dairy cows were randomly 
assigned into three treatments: control diet (CON; 20% starch, dry matter basis), high-concentrate diet (HC; 33.2% 
starch, dry matter basis) and high-concentrate diet supplemented with 180 mg thiamine/kg dry matter intake. Dry 
matter intake and milk production were recorded during the experimental periods. On day 21, rumen fluid samples 
were collected at 3 h postfeeding and ruminal pH, thiamine concentration and volatile fatty acids were measured. 
Metagenome sequencing method was conducted to detect ruminal fungi composition. Feeding HC significantly 
decreased dry matter intake, milk production, ruminal pH, ruminal acetate and thiamine concentration, however, 
significantly increased propionate and isovalerate (P < 0.05). These changes were inversed by thiamine supplementa-
tion (P < 0.05). Totally, seven phyla and almost 1050 species of rumen fungi were identified across all samples in which 
especially, 3 genera and 10 species of strictly anaerobic fungi phylum Neocallimastigomycota was found. Principal 
coordinate analysis indicated that feeding HC and thiamine supplementation caused a significant inverse in ruminal 
fungi composition. Feeding HC significantly decreased the abundance of fungi compared with CON (P < 0.05) while 
thiamine supplementation significantly increased the abundance of ruminal fungi (P < 0.05). These results indicated 
that thiamine supplementation may effectively attenuate rumen metabolic disorder caused by HC diet through 
buffering the ruminal pH, shifting the rumen fermentation pattern and increasing the abundance of ruminal fungi. 
The findings in this study could therefore contribute to the further understanding of the mechanism of thiamine’s 
function in dairy cows.

Introduction
Ruminal microbiota is a large systematic microbial eco-
system which is composed by an immense variety of 
bacteria, protozoa, anaerobic fungi and archaea (Hob-
son and Stewart 1997). Functions of this microbial eco-
system are to digest plant materials and convert them 
into energy and compounds which are absorbable for 
ruminants (Fernando et al. 2010; Mao et al. 2016; Pitta 
et al. 2016). The stability of ruminal microbiota is criti-
cal for maintaining the health of ruminants, however, in 
modern dairy cow production systems, high ferment-
able carbohydrates are frequently used to obtain higher 
milk production. The overfeeding of high-concentrate 
diet decreases ruminal pH, changes ruminal micro-
biota structure (McCann et al. 2016), influences rumi-
nal fermentation characteristics and consequently leads 
to subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) (Enemark 2008). 
SARA has been reported as one of the most serious 
nutritional diseases in high yielding dairy cows which 
costs a considerable economic loss all over the world 
each year (Valente et  al. 2017) and thus many efforts 
have been paid to prevent its occurrence. Interestingly, 
our previous study revealed that thiamine supplemen-
tation could attenuate high-concentrate diets induced 
SARA by decreasing ruminal lactate production and 
increasing ruminal pH value in rumen fluid (Pan et al. 
2016). Moreover, ruminal thiamine content was found 
to be closely related to Bacteroides, Ruminococcus 1, 
Ruminobacter etc. Thiamine supplementation to high-
concentrate diet attributed to the increasing abun-
dances of these bacteria (Pan et  al. 2017). However, 
these findings mainly focused on ruminal bacterial 
communities. The information on effect of thiamine 
supplementation on the composition of other microbial 
communities including fungi is still limited.
Rumen fungi were first mentioned as a major com-
ponent of rumen microbiota by a British scientist Colin 
Orpin (Orpin 1976), which account for about 5% of the 
total microbial biomass (Rezaeian et al. 2004). In ruminal 
condition, fungi produced a wide range of enzymes which 
could digest the major structural carbohydrates of plant 
cell walls, and ferment diet fiber to product absorbable 
compounds for the host animal (Fliegerova et  al. 2015; 
Sekhavati et  al. 2007). Previous studies about the func-
tion of rumen fungi mainly focused on fiber digestion, 
biogas production (Yıldırım et  al. 2017) and carbohy-
drate degradation (Phillips and Gordon 1995). However, 
the relationships between thiamine and the rumen fungi 
are still unclear. Thiamine supplementation shifted the 
rumen bacterial communities in our previous study 
(Pan et  al. 2017), and thiamine exerts beneficial effects 
in interactions between fungi and bacteria from lamb 
rumen (Chaucheyras-Durand and Fonty 2001). Thus, a 
hypothesis was proposed that thiamine supplementation 
may affect the abundance and functions of rumen fungi.
In the past years, several molecular techniques includ-
ing qPCR, Deformation gradient gel electrophoresis 
(DGGE) and 18S rRNA gene sequences were employed 
for detecting the predominance and diversity of dif-
ferent genera as well as species of rumen fungi. How-
ever, 18S rRNA gene sequencing based analysis of fungi 
have become obsolete because of the highly conserved 
nature of the 18S rRNA gene (Fliegerova et  al. 2015). 
Fortunately, based on the development of high through-
put sequencing technology, metagenomic sequenc-
ing method provided a new way to reveal details about 
microbial communities (Qin et  al. 2013). Metagenomic 
sequencing mainly uses next-generation sequencing 
technology to perform shotgun assays on genomic DNA 
of all microscopic organisms in samples to analyze the 
genetic diversity and abundance of microbial popula-
tions, and to interpret the genetic composition and func-
tional diversity of microbial populations (Kamke et  al. 
2016; Pitta et  al. 2016). Metagenomics sequencing has 
been widely applied in detecting the diversity and func-
tions of rumen and gut microbiota in recent years and 
these findings provided us deeper understandings about 
the micro-ecosystem (Mao et al. 2016; Qin et al. 2014). 
Therefore, metagenomic sequencing method was used in 
this study to detect the impacts of thiamine supplemen-
tation on ruminal fungi in dairy cows fed high-concen-
trate diets.
Materials and methods
Animals, experimental design and dietary treatments
Animal care and procedures were in accordance with the 
Chinese guidelines for animal welfare and approved by 
Animal Care and Use Committee of the Chinese Acad-
emy of Agricultural Sciences. Twelve Chinese Holstein 
dairy cows (627 ± 19.9 kg BW; 180 ± 8 DIM) in second-
parity fitted with 10  cm ruminal cannulas (Bar Dia-
mond, Parma, ID) were divided into three treatments. 
Treatments included a control diet (CON; 20% starch, 
dry matter basis), a high-concentrate diet (HC; 33.2% 
starch, dry matter basis) and high-concentrate diet sup-
plemented with 180  mg thiamine/kg dry matter intake 
(HCT). The diets were formulated according to NRC 
(2001) to meet or exceed the energy requirements of Hol-
stein dairy cows yielding 20 kg of milk/d with 3.5% milk 
fat and 3.0% true protein. Details of ingredient analy-
sis and chemical composition of diets were shown in 
Additional file 1: Table S1. Cows were fed twice equally 
at 06:00 and 18:00  h each day, and thiamine (thiamine 
hydrochloride, purity ≥ 99%; Wanrong Science and Tech-
nology Development Co., Ltd., Wuhan, China) was add 
via the rumen cannula twice daily after diets were offered 
Page 3 of 12
Xue et al. AMB Expr           (2018) 8:159 
for a 21 day period. Throughout the experimental peri-
ods, the cows were housed in individual stalls and had 
free access to fresh water.
Rumen fluid sampling and parameters measurement
During the experimental period, automatic feeding 
equipments (made by Institute of Animal Science Chi-
nese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China 
and NanShang Husbandry Science and Technology Ltd. 
Henan, China) were used to record dry matter intake. 
Milking facilities of Afimilk were applied to record milk 
production of each cow. On day 21, rumen contents were 
sampled from cranial, caudal, dorsal, and ventral sites of 
rumen at 3 h after the morning feeding. Collected sam-
ples were strained through four layers of cheesecloth to 
obtain rumen fluid. Rumen fluid was then divided into 
two parts. One part was processed to analyze the pH 
value, thiamine content and rumen volatile fatty acid 
(VFA) content. The other part was put into the liquid 
nitrogen immediately after adding stabilizer and then 
stored at − 80 °C for DNA extraction. Ruminal pH value 
was measured using a portable type pH meter (Testo 
205, Testo AG, Lenzkirch, Germany) immediately after 
rumen fluid sample collection. Thiamine concentration 
in rumen fluid was detected by high performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC) according to Analytical Meth-
ods Committee (2000). Individual and total VFA (TVFA) 
of ruminal fluid were determined by gas chromatograph 
(GC-2010, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan).
DNA extraction, library construction, and metagenomics 
sequencing
DNA for metagenomics was extracted from the rumen 
fluid samples by using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit 
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturer’s 
protocols. The DNA concentration and purity were quan-
tified with TBS-380 and NanoDrop2000, respectively. 
DNA quality was examined with the 1% agarose gels elec-
trophoresis system.
DNA was fragmented to an average size of 300  bp 
using Covaris M220 (Gene Company Limited, China) 
for paired-end library construction. Paired-end library 
was prepared by using TruSeqTM DNA Sample Prep Kit 
(Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Adapters containing 
the full complement of sequencing primer hybridization 
sites were ligated to the Blunt-end fragments. Paired-
end sequencing was performed on Illumina HiSeq 4000 
platform (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) using 
HiSeq  3000/4000 PE Cluster Kit and HiSeq  3000/4000 
SBS Kits according to the manufacturer’s instructions 
(http://www.illum​ina.com).
Sequence quality control and genome assembly
The quality control methods used the following crite-
ria: 3′ and 5′ ends were stripped using SeqPrep (https​
://githu​b.com/jstjo​hn/SeqPr​ep) (Aronesty 2013). Low-
quality reads (length < 50 bp or with a quality value < 20 
or having N bases) were removed by Sickle (https​://
githu​b.com/najos​hi/sickl​e). Sequences that lost their 
mated reads were considered as single reads and were 
used in the assembly procedure. Reads were aligned to 
the cow genome by NCBI (https​://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov) and any hit associated with the reads and their 
mated reads were removed. Filtered reads were consid-
ered for the next step of the analysis.
Considering that K-mers, varying from 1/3 to  2/3 of 
reads length were used in assembly by SOAP denovo 
(http://soap.genom​ics.org.cn, Version 1.06), which is 
based on De Brujin graph construction (Li et al. 2010). 
Scaffolds with a length over 500  bp were retained for 
statistical tests; we evaluated the quality and quantity of 
scaffolds generated by each assembly and finally chose 
the best K-mer which yielded the minimum scaffold 
number and the maximum value of N50 and N90. Then, 
scaffolds with a length over 500 bp were extracted and 
broken into contigs without gaps. Contigs were used 
for further gene prediction and annotation.
Gene prediction and taxonomy
Open reading frames (ORFs) from each sample were 
predicted using MetaGene (http://metag​ene.cb.k.u-
tokyo​.ac.jp/) (Bao et  al. 2014). The predicted ORFs 
with length being or over 100  bp were retrieved and 
translated to amino acid sequences using the NCBI 
translation table (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxon​
omy/taxon​omyho​me.html/index​.cgi?chapt​er=tgenc​
odes#SG1). All sequences from gene sets with a 95% 
sequence identity (90% coverage) were clustered as the 
non-redundant gene catalog by the CD-HIT (http://
www.bioin​forma​tics.org/cd-hit/). Reads after quality 
control were mapped to the representative genes with 
95% identity using SOAP aligner (http://soap.genom​ics.
org.cn/) and gene abundance in each sample was evalu-
ated (Qin et al. 2014). DIAMOND (Huson et al. 2016), 
a new alignment tool for aligning short DNA sequenc-
ing reads to a protein reference database was employed 
for taxonomic annotations by aligning non-redundant 
gene catalogs against NCBI NR database with e-value 
cutoff of ­1e−5 and Score > 60. Based on NCBI Microbial 
Taxonomy Information Database, species annotation 
information of genes was obtained and relative abun-
dance of species was calculated at the level of Kingdom, 
Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus and Species.

Statistical analysis
Ruminal pH and thiamine content were analyzed using 
one-way ANOVA of SAS 9.2. P value < 0.05 was consid-
ered to be significance and 0.05 ≤ P < 0.10 was considered 
as a tendency. Spearman correlations between fungi com-
munities and ruminal fermentation variables or thiamine 
content were assessed using the PROC CORR procedure 
of SAS 9.2. Relative abundance of all phyla, and the top 
30 species of fungi were chosen to conduct the correla-
tion analysis. A correlation matrix was created and visu-
alized in a heatmap format using R package version 3.3.1. 
The abundance of fungi communities and ruminal vari-
ables were considered to be correlated with each other 
when the absolute value of correlation coefficients (r) 
were above 0.55 and P-value below 0.05. Barplot, prin-
cipal coordinate analysis (PCoA), hierarchical clustering 
analysis (HCA) and heat map for different rumen fungi 
species were conducted using R package version 3.3.1.
Nucleotide sequence accession number
All the raw sequences were submitted to the NCBI 
Sequence Read Archive (SRA; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/Trace​s/sra/), under Accession Number SRP144478.
Results
Animal performance and rumen fermentation parameters
As shown in Table 1, HC feeding significantly decreased 
dry matter intake, milk production, ruminal pH value 
and the concentrations of thiamine and acetate in rumen 
fluid, while significantly increased the concentration 
of propionate and isovalerate compared with CON diet 
(P < 0.05). However, these changes caused by HC diet 
were inversed by thiamine supplementation (P < 0.05). 
Butyrate, valerate, isobutyrate and total VFA concentra-
tions were not affected by dietary treatments (P > 0.05).
Sequencing information
In the present study, 12 metagenomic libraries were con-
structed. Based on the quality control methods, all pol-
lution data were removed and approximately 45,000,000 
reads of per sample were acquired. The GC content of 
each sample was between 40–60% except HCT4, which 
had a lower GC content of 36.36%. The assembly results 
showed that a minimum of 130,000 contigs per sam-
ple were obtained. The N50 value was between 760 and 
890 bp for the samples (shown in Table 2). The aligned 
reads were annotated for gene prediction. The results 
indicated that numbers of prediction genes were mostly 
between 200,000 and 400,000. However sample HC3 was 
detected to contain a significant higher prediction gene 
numbers while sample HCT4 contained a significant 
lower prediction gene numbers.
Effect of HC feeding and thiamine supplementation 
on relative abundance of fungal communities
Principal 
coordinates 
analysis 
(PCoA) 
based 
on 
unweighted UniFrac distance metrics were conducted to 
compare the three treatments. As shown in Fig. 1, PCoA 
axes 1 and 2 accounted for 94.24% and 1.19% of the total 
variation, respectively. The cows offered HC separated 
from those offered CON and HCT by PCo1 effectively. 
Similarly, cows fed CON separated from those fed with 
HCT by PCo2.
In the present study, approximately 1050 species of 
rumen fungi were identified across all samples in seven 
characterized phyla and one uncharacterized phylum. All

taxonomy results are shown in Additional file  2: Excel. 
As shown in Fig.  2, Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and 
Chytridiomycota were the three most phyla for all three 
treatments. Relative abundance of Ascomycota was signif-
icantly higher in HC treatment than the other two treat-
ments. Neocallimastigomycota, characterized as a phylum 
of strictly anaerobic fungi, was identified including 3 gen-
era (g__Neocallimastix, g__Orpinomyces, and g__Piro-
myces) and 11 species (s__Neocallimastix_frontalis, 
s__Neocallimastix_patriciarum, s__Orpinomyces_joyonii,

sp._E2) (shown in Additional file 3). All identified fungi 
and their relative abundances in the level of phyla are dis-
played in Table 3. HC feeding significantly decreased the 
abundance of all phyla of fungi (P < 0.05) when compared 
with CON treatment. In contrast, thiamine supplementa-
tion significantly increased the abundance of all phyla of 
fungi (P < 0.05) compared with HC treatment.
Hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) and heat map 
analysis was conducted to further understand the effects 
of HC feeding and thiamine supplementation on ruminal 
fungi profile. Because little information of fungi phyla 
was detected, taxonomy level of classes and species were 
used for HCA and heat map analysis. As shown in Fig. 3, 
samples of HCT treatment gathered into a cluster which

was significantly separated from the other two treat-
ments no matter at the level of class or species. Samples 
of HC treatment were separated from those of CON at 
the level of class but not at the level of species. Across all 
three treatments, classes of Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, 
Chytridiomycota, and Blastocladiomycota gathered into 
a big cluster. At the species level, species of Mucorales 
gathered into a big cluster and Saccharomyces_cerevisiae 
which is often used in dairy feed, gathered into a single 
cluster.
Correlations between fungi communities and ruminal 
variables
As shown in Fig.  4, the relative abundance of all phyla 
was negatively correlated with the concentration of 
TVFA, acetate, propionate and isovalerate (r < − 0.55, 
P < 0.05). In particular, Chytridiomycota was positively 
correlated with butyrate concentration (r > 0.55, P < 0.05). 
There was a trend that the abundances of all phyla of 
fungi were positively correlated with ruminal pH and 
thiamine content (r < 0.55, 0.10 > P > 0.05). Similarly, all 
the top 20 species of fungi had significantly negative 
correlated to TVFA, acetate, propionate and isovalerate 
(r < − 0.55, P < 0.05). Whilst, Tetrapisispora_blattae and 
Allomyces_macrogynus both had positively relationships 
with butyrate content (r > 0.55, P < 0.05). In addition, a 
trend was also found that the abundances of all the top 20 
species of fungi were positively correlated with ruminal 
pH and thiamine content (r < 0.55, 0.10 > P > 0.05).
Discussion
Composition of ruminal fungi
In the present study 7 phyla and almost 1050 species 
were identified, the sequencing depth and data size were 
improved when compared with previous studies (Kumar 
et al. 2015; Mercado-Garcia 2017; O’Malley et al. 2014), 
and many species of the rumen fungi were first reported 
such as Blastocladiomycota, Chytridiomycota, Micro-
sporidia and Glomeromycota result. The proportion of 
Ascomycota in the whole 7 phyla of fungi in HC treat-
ment significantly increased compared with that in the 
other two treatments, which indicated that phylum Asco-
mycota had better resistibility to the changed condition 
caused by HC diet. As the most representative species of 
Ascomycota, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was always used 
as the additive to alleviate subacute ruminal acidosis in 
lactating dairy cows (Alzahal et al. 2014), and the result 
further elaborated the function of Saccharomyces cer-
evisiae in alleviating SARA (Alzahal et al. 2014). Neocal-
limastigomycota, although took up a small proportion, 
attracted more attention in the rumen microbiome (Hib-
bett et  al. 2007) because of its strictly anaerobic char-
acterization and the ability of producing wide array of 
cell-bound and cell-free cellulolytic, hemicellulolytic, 
glycolytic, and proteolytic enzymes (Liggenstoffer et  al. 
2010). Sequencing and functional researches of Neocal-
limastigomycota were proceeded in recent years in order 
to explore the mechanism of its functions in rumen such 
as the high-throughput expressed sequence tag (EST) 
analysis of Neocallimastix frontalis (Mi et al. 2009) and 
the analysis of the Orpinomyces genome (Youssef et  al. 
2013). The results of the present study that the pro-
portion of Neocallimastigomycota was increased after 
thiamine supplementation in the whole rumen micro-
biomass may provide useful information in investigating 
the mechanism of Neocallimastigomycota.
Effect of thiamine supplementation on ruminal fungi 
composition
In the present study, HC significantly decreased the 
abundance of fungi (P < 0.05) compared with CON treat-
ment. This finding was in line with several previous stud-
ies in which a greater fungal diversity and higher fungal 
abundance were detected in animals fed high-fiber diets 
than those offered high-grain diets (Belanche et al. 2012; 
Kumar et al. 2015). The main function of rumen fungi is 
to degrade diet fiber and product absorbable compounds 
for the host animal (Li 2003; Theodorou et  al. 1996). 
Because of the higher gain and lower fiber content in HC, 
less substrates were provided for fungi growth, therefore 
leading to the decreased abundance of rumen fungi in 
HC treatment.
However, the fungal abundance increased significantly 
after thiamine supplementation in HC treatment which 
indicated that thiamine supplementation promoted the 
proliferation and metabolism of rumen fungi. Thiamine is 
an essential nutrient for dairy cows and plays important 
roles in carbohydrate metabolism (Kamke et  al. 2010; 
Subramanya et al. 2010). The promotion of carbohydrate 
metabolism and its interaction with ruminal microbiome 
might have contribute to the increased fungal abundance.

In ruminal anaerobic environment, ruminal fungi 
energy 
generation 
organelles 
are 
represented 
by 
hydrogenosomes. These organelles, under anoxic con-
ditions, decarboxylate malate into acetate, CO2 and 
H2 with concomitant production of energy in the form 
of ATP (Van 2010; Yarlett and Hackstein 2005). Rumen 
fungi exhibit tremendous diversity of CAZymes, which 
work together to degrade carbohydrates and cellulose 
into monosaccharides and then the monosaccharides 
are further hydrolyzed into pyruvate (Hall and Mertens 
2017). As the cofactor of pyruvate formate-lyase (PFL) 
and pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFO), thiamine 
supplementation promoted the reaction of pyruvate gen-
erating into acetyl-CoA (Xue et al. 2018), enhanced the 
utilization of pyruvate and promoted the degradation effi-
ciency of carbohydrates which lead to more ATP formed 
to support the metabolism and proliferation of ruminal 
fungi in the current study. Besides, thiamine supplemen-
tation significantly decreased rumen VFAs content and 
increased ruminal pH (Pan et al. 2016), which promoted 
the activity of CAZymes (Fliegerova et al. 2015). There-
fore, fungal abundance significantly increased in the cur-
rent study.
Interaction with other microorganisms may also con-
tribute to the change of ruminal fungi. Ruminal micro-
organism works in harmony to keep the health and 
productivity of ruminants (Hobson and Stewart 1997; 
Mickdam et al. 2016). In particular, many positive associ-
ations were observed between fungi and bacteria, such as 
Caecomyces1—Ruminococcus1 and Piromyces3—Succini-
clasticum (Smidt et al. 2010; Tapio et al. 2017). Thiamine 
was detected to induce a significant increase of fungal 
growth in fungi and bacteria co-culture system (Shimizu 
et  al. 2016) which indicated that thiamine promoted 
the mutualism of fungi and bacteria. In addition, previ-
ous study of our team indicated that HC significantly 
decreased the abundance of Bacteroides and Ruminococ-
cus 1 (Pan et  al. 2017). As stated above, the decreased 
Ruminococcus 1 may partly contribute to the decreased 
rumen fungi in HC treatment. Thiamine supplementa-
tion stimulated the growth of the lactate utilizing bacte-
ria Ruminococcus 1 (Pan et al. 2017), and thus increased 
the abundance of rumen fungi indirectly.
In conclusion, HC significantly decreased while thia-
mine supplementation significantly increased the abun-
dance of rumen fungi. These results indicated that 
thiamine supplementation may effectively attenuate 
rumen metabolic disorder caused by HC diet through 
buffering the ruminal pH, shifting the rumen fermenta-
tion pattern and increasing the abundance of ruminal 
fungi. The findings in this study could therefore contrib-
ute to the further understanding of the mechanism of 
thiamine’s function in dairy cows and provide effective 
strategies to improve dairy cows’ health under high-con-
centrate feeding regime.
