Abstract
Diversity in reproductive structures is frequently explained by selection acting at individual
to generational timescales, but interspecific differences predicted by such models (e.g.,
female choice or sexual conflict) are often untestable in a phylogenetic framework. An alter-
native approach focuses on clade- or function-specific hypotheses that predict evolutionary
patterns in terms neutral to specific modes of sexual selection. Here we test a hypothesis
that diversity of reproductive structures in leiobunine harvestmen (daddy longlegs) of east-
ern North America reflects two sexually coevolved but non-overlapping precopulatory strat-
egies, a primitive solicitous strategy (females enticed by penis-associated nuptial gifts), and
a multiply derived antagonistic strategy (penis exerts mechanical force against armature of
the female pregenital opening). Predictions of sexual coevolution and fidelity to precopula-
tory categories were tested using 10 continuously varying functional traits from 28 species.
Multivariate analyses corroborated sexual coevolution but failed to partition species by pre-
copulatory strategy, with multiple methods placing species along a spectrum of mechanical
antagonistic potential. These findings suggest that precopulatory features within species
reflect different co-occurring levels of solicitation and antagonism, and that gradualistic evo-
lutionary pathways exist between extreme strategies. The ability to quantify antagonistic
potential of precopulatory structures invites comparison with ecological variables that may
promote evolutionary shifts in precopulatory strategies.
Introduction
Understanding the rapidly-evolving and species-specific morphologies of genitalia and other
sexually dimorphic structures is a long-standing goal of evolutionary biology [1–3], with
recent efforts focusing on how female mate choice and sexual conflict operate at individual or
generational timescales within populations or species [4–6]. However, attempts to explain the
origin and expansion of interspecific diversity by extrapolating such models to phylogenetic

timescales is problematic given persistent debate about basic concepts (such as the relation-
ships between female mate choice and sexual conflict) and the often non-exclusive predictions
of such models [7–9]. An alternative perspective is to test clade-specific and function-based
hypotheses that predict interspecific patterns in reproductive morphology, such as the order,
direction, and co-occurrence of evolutionary change in homologous reproductive behaviors
and structures [10–15] that do not rely on specific models of sexual selection. Here we use
interspecific comparisons of reproductive morphology in the eastern North American clade of
leiobunine harvestmen (daddy longlegs) [16–17] to explore evolutionary change in two pre-
copulatory strategies: solicitous courtship via nuptial gifts, and precopulatory antagonism via
mechanical forces [15] (where "antagonism" refers to apparent conflict during behavioral inter-
actions rather than to differential fitness between contestants or specific microevolutionary
processes).
Detailed studies of mating in leiobunine harvestmen (Fig 1A and 1B) began very recently
[5,18,19] and fundamental insights continue to emerge. Notably, field observations once sug-
gested that precopulatory behavior is simple or effectively absent, with copulation or rejection
occurring rapidly upon incidental physical contact [20–23]. Yet video-based observations
revealed a variety of close-contact precopulatory behaviors that superficially resemble copula-
tion. Previous misinterpretations can be attributed to precopulatory interaction of the penis
with the anatomically adjacent oral and pregenital openings of the female (Fig 1A and 1B).
This can include the rapid delivery of nuptial gifts to the female's mouth via penile sacs and
persistent contact between the penis and the pregenital opening, including apparent forceful
penetration in some species [18,19]. Mating behavior is still unknown for most species, and
inferences about precopulatory strategies have tended to rely on comparative functional mor-
phology [5].
We recently surveyed diversity in the reproductive morphology in leiobunine harvestmen
[15] and examined the phylogenetic distribution of two binary traits: presence or absence of
subterminal penile sacs that deliver secreted nuptial gifts (Figs 1A–1C and 2B), and presence or
absence of sclerotized pregenital armature in females (Fig 2B, S1 Fig). Of the four possible
male/female-trait combinations, two were widespread among the 29 species examined, one
combination being consistent with solicitous courtship (males with gift-bearing sacs, females
without pregenital barriers), and the other with precopulatory antagonism (males without sacs,
females with pregenital barriers). The two remaining combinations occurred in just three spe-
cies. Phylogenetic comparative analysis showed that the solicitous combination is primitive
and was replaced at least five times by an antagonistic combination, with the loss of penile sacs
and gain of female pregenital barriers being highly correlated and usually occurring on the
same phylogenetic branch (Fig 2A). We also found a strong association between the loss of
penile sacs and the gain of enhanced clasping pedipalps in males. Based on these findings, we
hypothesized that sexual coevolution in leiobunine harvestmen had produced two morphologi-
cal syndromes that reflect two general non-overlapping strategies: solicitous courtship via
penis-associated nuptial gifts and precopulatory antagonism via mechanical force exerted by
the penis against the female pregenital opening.
Here we used multiple continuous variables derived from mechanical functions of repro-
ductive structures in both sexes to test our predictions that structural diversity has coevolved in
the two sexes to produce two functionally-distinct precopulatory syndromes. We measured
10 functional variables with magnitudes that should vary in proportion to the intensity of
mechanical force used in precopulatory interaction, i.e., the relative force that a structure can
generate, transmit, or resist. These variables included cuticular investment in reproductive
structures, the relative forces produced by three skeletomuscular lever systems, and estimates
of penile flexural resistance. In keeping with our previous study, we found convincing evidence

for sexual coevolution in structural traits. However, interspecific variation in structure was dis-
tributed within a solicitous-to- antagonistic spectrum rather than in separate clusters. These
findings suggest that the sexes have coevolved to produce precopulatory strategies that differ in
the intensities of both solicitation and mechanical antagonism. The ability to quantify interspe-
cific patterns in antagonistic potential invites a search for correlations with ecological or life-
history factors that may explain the evolution of mating systems at phylogenetic time scales
Methods
(a) Taxon sample and phylogeny
We collected specimens from 28 out of 29 described and/or non-problematic eastern North
American leiobunine species [17] for inclusion in this project (due to a lack of replication,
Hadrobunus n. sp. 2 was not included). To ensure the validity of phylogenetic comparative
methods, specimens (119 male, 147 female) were collected from localities near those from
which specimens used in previous molecular phylogenetic analysis were obtained [17] (S1
Table). They were preserved in 70–100% ethanol. To provide an evolutionary framework and
to correct for variance due to shared evolutionary history, we based all comparative methods
on a maximum clade credibility tree (Fig 2A) developed from a posterior distribution of trees
reconstructed from nuclear and mitochondrial sequences [15,17].
(b) Data
We used 10 structural variables—two from females and eight from males—with values that
were predicted to increase in proportion to the mechanical forces employed during precopula-
tory antagonism (see Table 1 for summary). Measurements (in mm) were made in ImageJ

MZ APO dissecting microscope (0.63X or 1.0X objective lens, 8–80X zoom) or Wild Heer-
brugg Makrozoom 1:5 with 6.2–32X zoom. Measurements were size-corrected (details below)
and log-transformed to account for interspecific heteroscedasticity. Species means for each var-
iable were obtained from three to 10 specimens (S1 Table).
Correction for size effects.
Body size was represented by carapace width measured at the
junction of leg coxae I and II, a measurement that is largely unaffected by nutritional, repro-
ductive, or preservational condition. Because relative values of many mechanical variables
change predictably in systems that scale isometrically, we controlled for size by dividing each
variable by the dimensionally appropriate transformation of carapace width (e.g., a mechanical
variable that is expected to change in proportion to cross-sectional area was divided by the
square of carapace width) (Table 1). Effectiveness of dimensional size correction was evaluated

in two ways. First, we conducted a phylogenetic principal components analysis (pPCA) [25,26]
on all variables, including male and female body size. Because the first principal component
(PC1) is generally regarded as a size axis in morphometric analyses [27], exclusive or primary
loading of body size on PC1 would suggest inadequate size correction by the dimensional
method. Second, we conducted two sets of phylogenetic regressions between male and female
variables, one using a dimensional size correction, and one using a phylogenetic approach
(25,26). Differences in the statistical significance of correlations due to size correction methods
would indicate a problem in dimensional size correction.
Relative female pregenital closing force.
From basic lever mechanics, the closing force of
the female genital operculum is the product of the force generated by the closing muscles (mus-
cle 13 in [28]) and their mechanical advantage at the pregenital opening. The relative value for
muscle force was inferred from the effective cross-sectional area of the muscle. Mechanical
advantage was inferred from opercular anatomy (S2A–S2C Fig). Given that closing force
should vary in proportion to effective cross-sectional area of the opercular closing muscles, this
variable was size corrected by dividing it by the square of carapace width.
Relative forces of penis muscles. We estimated the relative forces generated by two penis
muscles. The fibers of the intrinsic penis muscle (muscle 104 in [28]) (S2D Fig) arise from the
walls of the penis and insert along a tendon that flexes the glans-shaft joint. The penis protrac-
tor muscle (muscle 101 in [28]) (Fig 1C and 1D) arises on the ventrolateral surface of the geni-
tal operculum and sternite, and inserts at the base of the penis (Fig 1C and 1D).
We randomly selected 3–6 fibers in each muscle and measured their cross-sectional
areas and angles with respect to the long axis of the penis (intrinsic muscle) or body (protractor
muscle). The relative force of each muscle was calculated by multiplying the average fiber

cross-sectional area, fiber number and the cosine of the average fiber angle. Mechanical advan-
tage was determined by measuring the input and output levers in ImageJ and multiplying
input lever length by the relative muscle force to yield the total relative force divided by output
lever length. We anticipated higher relative muscle forces in species with greater potential for
precopulatory antagonism. Size effects on muscle-force estimates were corrected by dividing by
the square of carapace width.
Penis length.
This variable is related, in part, to the mechanics of penile protraction. Short
penes are pushed forward by haemolymph pressure that everts the walls of the pregenital
chamber; the exposed penis is thus mounted on a flexible, fluid-filled “balloon” (haematodo-
cha) which offers low resistance to opposing forces (Fig 1C). In contrast, long penes are pushed
forward throughout their excursion and resist opposing forces through contraction of the pro-
tractor muscles (Fig 1D). We thus anticipated relatively longer penes in species with greater
intensities of precopulatory antagonism. Penis length was corrected for body size by dividing
by carapace width.
Cuticular investment.
The maximum mechanical force that a sclerite can transmit or
resist likely varies in proportion to the amount of its constituent cuticle. We measured cuticular
investment in three structures—the penis, male pedipalps and female genital operculum (Fig
1A). Each structure was removed from sample individuals. The body (minus legs removed at
the coxa-trochanter joint) and the isolated structures were macerated in a 5% KOH solution at
65–68°C for 24–48 hours, rinsed in 100% ethanol, and dried overnight at 65–68°C. The mass
of the body and each removed structure was determined with a Mettler Toledo MT5 microbal-
ance (resolution 0.001 μg), and the ratio of the mass of each part to total body mass was calcu-
lated. Mass ratios required no size correction.
Section modulus of penis shaft.
Harvestman penes can be modeled as hollow beams.
When comparing a series of beams of similar composition, the relative magnitudes of several
mechanical parameters can be estimated from cross-sectional profiles [29]. For example, a
beam's flexural stiffness increases with both the amount of material that resists bending and its
distance (d4) from the beam’s flexural axis, where dorsal or ventral bending has a horizontal
(X) axis and lateral bending has a vertical (Y) axis (S3 Fig). Flexural stiffness is estimated by the
second moment of area (IX, lY). We compared penes using elastic section moduli (SX, SY),
which are calculated as
SX¼ IX=dY max
SY¼ IY=dXmax
Elastic section modulus estimates a beam’s relative elastic strength (i.e., the smallest flexural
force that will permanently damage the beam). Because the highest tensile and compressive
forces experienced in bending occur farthest from the flexural axis, the material located at the
maximum radius (d max) will be the first to fail. We anticipated larger section moduli in spe-
cies that experience greater intensities of precopulatory antagonism.
Penes were isolated and embedded in JB-4 plastic medium (Electron Microscopy Sciences)
following manufacturer’s specifications. Samples were oriented longitudinally in polymeriza-
tion blocks following [30] and maintained overnight at 4°C under vacuum. Two to three 5-μm
sections were obtained from the mid-shaft using a Microm HM 325 microtome. Outlines of
the cuticle and lumen of each section were traced from digitized photographs using a Wacom
Pen Tablet in Adobe Photoshop CS4 to create high-contrast images (S3 Fig). Images were
imported into ImageJ and values for SX and SY were obtained using MomentMacroJ [31]. Each
value was corrected for size by dividing by the cube of carapace width.

Penile fulturae.
The flexible walls of the male pregenital chamber contain a bilateral, ven-
trolateral pair of longitudinal sclerites that articulate posteriorly with the base of the penis and
anteriorly with the anterior margin of the genital operculum (Fig 1A–1C). The sclerites bend
during protraction and appear to act as springs that assist or stabilize penis movement. We pre-
dicted that wider fulturae store and return more mechanical energy than narrower fulturae and
thus that wider fulturae are more likely to be associated with precopulatory antagonism. We
corrected for size by dividing fultural width by carapace width.
(c) Data analysis
Species means were compiled and imported into the R software environment [32]. We esti-
mated phylogenetic signal in the data using Pagel's lambda [33,34] calculated in the geiger
package [35]. Although lambda was found to be very low for all variables, we used appropriate
comparative tests to compensate for any residual phylogenetic signal.
We regarded a significant positive correlation between male and female variables as corrob-
orating the prediction of sexual coevolution. We assessed the intersexual correlation using all
variables simultaneously by phylogenetic canonical correlation analysis (pCCA) [26,36] with
variables categorized by sex. We also conducted bivariate phylogenetic regressions analyses
(pRA) [26] between all pairs of male and female variables.
The hypothesis that solicitous courtship and precopulatory antagonism operate in a mutu-
ally exclusive manner predicts that species should be distributed in two distinct clusters. The
prediction was assessed using several methods. Cluster analysis was performed using a model-
based approach [37] implemented in mclust [38], which evaluates results from different clus-
tering models using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Recovery of two unmixed
clusters would corroborate the distinctiveness of solicitous courtship and precopulatory antag-
onism. We also assessed whether interspecific variation was distributed continuously or clus-
tered into functional groups by examining species scores from the pCCA, pRAs and pPCA
[26], although these methods are not optimized for group classification [39].
We tested the prediction that species with penile sacs and unarmed female genital opercula
occupy a distinct solicitous group, and that those without penile sacs but with female pregenital
armature occupy a distinct antagonistic category. We used phylogenetic flexible discriminant
analysis [40] and standard (non-phylogenetic) linear discriminant analysis in the MASS pack-
age [41] for one set of analyses using presence or absence of penile gift-bearing sacs as the
grouping variable and another set of analyses using presence or absence of female pregenital
barriers.
Results
(a) Effectiveness of dimensional size correction
We compared results from a phylogenetic principal components analysis (pPCA) with body
size and a pPCA without body size to assess the effectiveness of dimensional size correction
(Fig 3C and 3D). Male and female body size did not load exclusively on PC1 (Table 2), indicat-
ing that PC1 is not simply a size axis. Phylogenetic regression analyses (pRA) of male and
female variables using dimensional size correction produced results very similar to those
obtained from pRA using regression-based size correction. The pRA using the dimensional
approach yielded significant correlations between female pregenital closing force and each of
three male variables—penis protraction force (R2 = 0.241, p<0.01) (Fig 3B), intrinsic penile
muscle force (R2 = 0.264, p<0.01) and penis length (R2 = 0.482, p<0.0001) (S4 Fig)—but pRAs
for other variable pairs, such as cuticular investment in male and female structures, were not
significant. The pRA using phylogenetic residual size correction found significant correlations

between the same pairs of female and male variables—female pregenital closing force vs. penis

penis length (R2 = 0.142, p<0.05)—but no other variable pairs. We concluded that the dimen-
sional approach to size correction was effective.
(b) Tests of sexual coevolution in mechanical variables
A phylogenetic canonical correlation analysis (pCCA) using all 10 variables partitioned by sex
(λ = 6.75e-05, lnL λ = 43.55) yielded two canonical factors, with only CF1 offering useful infor-
mation (Fig 3A). Major-axis regression of the CF1 axes revealed a significant correlation (R2 =
0.561, p< 0.001) consistent with sexual coevolution. Species were distributed continuously
along the regression, with "high antagonistic" species occupying one end, "low antagonistic"
species occupying the other, and a central region of overlap. Those species with female pregeni-
tal armature and lacking penile gift sacs occurred in the "high antagonistic" region; those with
penile gift sacs and lacking female armature were concentrated in the "low antagonistic" region.
Phylogenetic regression analyses (pRA) using dimensional size correction yielded significant
correlations between female pregenital closing force and each of three male variables—penis
protraction force (Fig 3B), intrinsic penile muscle force (S4A Fig), and penis length (S4B Fig)—
which is consistent with sexual coevolution between these variables. These regressions showed
species distributions similar to that recovered by pCCA.
Results from pPCA provided several significant insights. We interpreted PC1 to be an axis
of mechanical antagonistic potential. Species were arranged along this axis with "high antago-
nism" forms concentrated toward one end, "low antagonism" forms at the other, and a region
of overlap in the center. Further, the distribution of species is very similar to that recovered by
pCCA. Those variables that were most highly correlated with one another in pairwise pRA—all
estimated male and female force variables and penis length—loaded almost exclusively on PC1
(Table 2), with the force variables being perhaps the most direct indictor of precopulatory
antagonistic ability. Cuticular variables—fultura width, penile flexural strength, and cuticular
investment variables—loaded weakly to moderately on both PC1 and PC2 (Table 2).

(c) Clustering, discriminant function analysis and categories of
precopulatory strategies
Model-based clustering analysis using BIC from mixture models was fitted by an EM algorithm
[38]. The best model for species clustering based on BIC was an ellipsoidal multivariate normal
model with one cluster (lnL = 174.93, BIC = 49.96), a result that was inconsistent with the pre-
diction that species are distributed into separate solicitous and antagonistic categories. Separate
solicitous and antagonistic clusters were also absent from plots derived from pCCA, pPCA and
pRA (Fig 3).
Standard linear discriminant analysis (LDA) resulted in 85% of species being placed into
anticipated solicitous and antagonistic groups based on presence and absence of penile sacs,
respectively (S5 Fig). Phylogenetic flexible discriminate analysis (pFDA), which incorporated
an estimate of Pagel's lambda (λ = 6.75e-05) obtained from pPCA, grouped species at an error
rate of 12.4% based on penile morphology. Using presence or absence of female pregenital
armature, LDA correctly placed 89% of species, which was consistent with results derived
from pFDA (mean error rate: 10%). However, neither the penile-sacs grouping variable (Wilk’s
λ = 0.44, F12,15 = 1.56, p = 0.2054) nor the female pregenital barrier variable (Wilk’s λ = 0.46,
F12,15 = 1.47, p = 0.2387) provided a statistically significant discriminant model. The inability
of cluster and discriminant analyses to partition species into separate groups is inconsistent
with the prediction that leiobunine harvestmen present two mutually-exclusive precopulatory
strategies. Rather, results from discriminant analysis, pCCA, pRA and pPCA indicate the spe-
cies are distributed continuously.
Discussion
(a) Sexual coevolution of functional genitalic traits and a spectrum of
precopulatory antagonism
Our previous research on the leiobunine harvestmen of eastern North America [15] suggests
that genitalic diversity is consistent with two sexually coevolved and mutually-exclusive pre-
copulatory strategies: 1) a primitive solicitous strategy in which males bear nuptial gifts in
cuticular penile sacs and females have unarmed pregenital openings, and 2) a derived antago-
nistic strategy in which males lack penile sacs and females have sclerotized pregenital defenses.
Two aspects of that study led us to question whether its conclusions would be robust to new
morphological data. First, the analysis was based on the phylogenetic distribution of two binary
(categorical) characters that biased the result toward recovery of up to four mutually-exclusive
character-state combinations. Second, any causal link between the loss of penile sacs and gain
of pregenital barriers is likely to be indirect; that is, the loss of penile sacs does not seem neces-
sary for males to apply mechanical forces to the female's pregenital opening, and females need
not defend their pregenital openings against the absence of male-generated nuptial gifts. The
present analysis addressed these issues by testing predictions using continuously-distributed
functional variables, most derived from biomechanical interpretations of genitalic structure.
The prediction that continuous functional variables have undergone sexual coevolution was
largely corroborated by our analysis. Phylogenetic canonical correlation (pCCA), with variables
partitioned by sex, yielded a significant positive correlation between the two female and eight
male variables (Fig 3A). Furthermore, bivariate phylogenetic regression analysis (pRA)
between male and female variables produced significant positive correlations in comparisons
of relative female pregenital closing force and three male variables—relative penis protraction
force, relative intrinsic penile muscle force, and penis length (Fig 3B and S4 Fig). These
variables have direct mechanical interactions (i.e., synergism among male variables and

antagonism between male and female variables) and also load heavily and almost exclusively
on PC1 (interpreted here as an axis of antagonistic potential) in phylogenetic principal compo-
nents analysis (pPCA) (Table 2 and Fig 3D). Relationships between all other pairs of male and
female variables were not significant, although they may have contributed to the pCCA results.
The non-significant bivariate relationships involved cuticular variables—penile fulturae, penile
section moduli, and cuticular investment in the penis, female operculum, and male pedipalp. It
is possible that their anticipated role in antagonism was too indirect or oversimplified; direct
measurement of their kinetic properties might have been more informative than the structural
proxies used here. We conclude that sexual coevolution exists between functional variables col-
lectively and between pairs of variables associated most directly with the production of precop-
ulatory antagonistic forces (i.e., attempted penetration of the female pregenital opening by
males and resistance by females).
Cluster analysis of functional variables did not organize species into predicted solicitous and
antagonistic groups, or into separate, quantitatively defined groups of any kind. In addition,
discriminant function analyses—some using presence or absence of penile sacs and some using
presence or absence of female pregenital barriers as grouping variables—failed to place species
reliably into two classes (S5 Fig). In contrast, pCCA, pPCA and the significant pRAs arranged
species into similar and essentially linear distributions (Fig 3A, 3B and 3D). We attribute this
distribution to a spectrum of precopulatory antagonistic potential, a conclusion supported by
two main observations. First, there is a consistent and intuitively sensible polarity in the distri-
bution of species. Specifically, "antagonistic" species (i.e., females have forceful pregenital clos-
ing mechanisms and pregenital barriers and males have long, non-sacculate penes operated by
forceful intrinsic and protractor muscles) tend to occur at one end of the distribution, "solici-
tous" species (i.e., females have weak pregenital closing mechanisms and no pregenital barriers
and males have short, sacculate penises operated by low-force mechanisms) are located at the
other end of the distribution, and there is a central region of overlap, which includes species
with unusual intermediate combinations of features (e.g., female pregenital barrier and short
sacculate penes). Second, the species are distributed broadly along PC1 in the pPCA and the
variables that load most heavily on this axis are those most closely associated with antagonistic
interactions between the sexes, especially estimated relative mechanical forces. These observa-
tions lead us to conclude that PC1 represents an axis of precopulatory antagonistic potential.
The continuous distribution of species along the antagonistic axis suggests that extant genitalic
diversity reflects variable combinations of intensity of solicitation and antagonism, that mating
systems can evolve gradually along the solicitation-to-antagonism species, and that antagonism
can be quantified by individual or latent variables, especially estimated force variables.
(b) Can we understand genitalic diversification in harvestmen using
comparative methods?
Behavioral ecologists have tended to attribute the origin and maintenance of certain reproduc-
tive traits to specific evolutionary processes. For example, the presence of apparent nuptial gifts
or male ornaments has generally been associated with female choice [3], while apparent sexual
armaments or antagonistic intersexual behaviors have implied the work of sexual conflict [42].
If such associations were valid, results from the present analysis might indicate that female
choice and sexual conflict have acted together at different intensities in harvestmen to generate
a spectrum of genitalic morphologies. However, empirical and theoretical work on female mate
choice shows that these associations are unreliable (e.g., nuptial gifts may manipulate female
physiology in ways that lower her fitness) [43], that female choice and sexual conflict offer
non-exclusive morphological and behavioral predictions (see below), and even that choice and

conflict themselves are inseparable rather than alternative processes [7,9]. The complicated
and unsettled status of the discipline introduces substantial difficulties for partitioning effects
of different evolutionary mechanisms at the population level [4,8,44], let alone at phylogenetic
timescales.
Due to the correlative nature of comparative methods, progress using phylogeny-based tests
relies on evolutionary hypotheses that predict mutually-exclusive patterns of interspecific
diversity. Current concepts of female choice and sexual conflict fail to offer such predictions
and, in fact, blur the distinction between sexual ornaments and armaments. For example, the
Fisherian "run-away" model of female choice [44,45] maintains that mating enhances fitness in
both sexes and predicts that attractive male features and female preference for these features
will be represented disproportionately in the next generation, leading to an evolutionary
progression of increasingly complex or exaggerated male ornaments. However, the same pro-
gression is also consistent with conflict-based "chase-away" models [46,47], wherein male
attractiveness entices females to mate at higher than optimal rates, thereby increasing male fit-
ness at the expense of female fitness. Females would then be selected to evolve higher sensitivity
thresholds, thereby escaping male exploitation but also increasing selective pressure on males
to intensify enticing stimuli [46]. An evolutionary progression in male attractiveness is thus
consistent with both female choice and sexual conflict. Similarly, armaments and antagonistic
behaviors may evolve via sexual conflict; for example, males may enhance individual fitness by
coercing copulations in a manner that reduces female fitness, either by overriding mating pref-
erences or reducing future reproductive potential [8,48]. However, female resistance to copula-
tion and male efforts to overcome this resistance may be an inevitable consequence of female
choice; that is, low-quality males that cannot overcome female resistance will be excluded
in favor of high-quality males that can. Under this scenario, fitness benefits could accrue to
females directly by reducing a potentially detrimental mating rate or indirectly via production
of antagonistically-superior sons [8,9]. Thus, apparent sexually antagonistic coevolution is con-
sistent with sexual conflict, female choice, or both [8,9,49]. In sum, comparative methods may
discover evolutionary patterns in genitalic form and function but are unlikely to distinguish
potential roles for female choice and sexual conflict in producing them.
If the predictions of individual-, generational- or population-level models of genitalic diver-
sification, like female choice and sexual conflict, cannot be usefully extrapolated to phyloge-
netic scales, one must ask whether there are conditions under which phylogenetic comparative
methods can contribute to understanding genitalic evolution. We maintain that there are. For
example, the classic work of Emlen & Oring [50] highlighted the role of ecology and life history
in limiting sexual selection and the structure of mating systems (e.g., polygamy requires access
to spatial, temporal and nutritional resources sufficient to find and acquire multiple mates). If
genital morphology is likewise influenced by sexual selection, as is widely accepted [2,4,6] and
even demonstrated in the case of genital complexity and polygamy [11], one might expect
interspecific associations between ecology and genitalic structure [51]. Such associations may
be too indirect for comparative methods to detect in many systems, but harvestman genitalia
appear to be a particularly apt case. Penes in leiobunine harvestmen are involved directly in the
delivery of secreted nuptial gifts produced from material acquired in the environment, and
antagonistic skeletomuscular mechanisms impose potential costs in material, energy, and
developmental time. Interestingly, leiobunine harvestmen in tropical areas have "low-antago-
nism" morphologies (penile gift sacs, no female pregenital barriers, short penes, etc.), whereas
"high-antagonism" morphologies are limited to temperate regions. These associations suggest
that the intensity of precopulatory antagonism are inversely correlated with the duration or
quality of the breeding season; that is, antagonism may be favored over enticement when
resources are in short supply or of unpredictable duration [5,16]. Significantly, such

predictions can be tested at phylogenetic scales, where species may differ substantially in ecol-
ogy or life history, and within species, where relationships between ecology, sexual selection,
and genital function can be explored via observation, experiment, or comparisons between
populations occupying different environments. Consequently, hypotheses formulated for use
with comparative methods may offer explanations for genitalic diversification that are more
robust to evolutionary timescale than those designed for population-level tests.

sagittal section of female L. verrucosum showing position of operculum levator (pregenital clos-
ing) muscle. (b) Relative closing force of levator muscle was estimated by determining muscle
scar width (w) in millimeters and fiber-attachment angle (θ) in degrees at six evenly spaced
points (w1-w6) along the levator muscle scar of the operculum. (c) Using GraphPad Prism, v.
5.04 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, Calif., USA), the values (wn x cos θn) were plotted against
muscle-scar length and fitted using a least-squares polynomial regression. The resulting equa-
tion was integrated over the interval 0 to total scar length to estimate the maximum relative
closing force produced by the muscle (FI). Because the genital operculum is a lever system, the
relative closing force at the anterior margin (FO) equals FI multiplied by the muscle’s mechani-
cal advantage (LI/LO). LI is the distance from the hinge to the point where FI is applied, which
is taken as the longitudinal position of the centroid of FI (i.e., the point along the muscle scar
where the cumulative area under the regression curve equals FI/2). LO is the distance from
the hinge (fulcrum) to the anterior margin of the operculum and was measured directly. (d)
Method for estimating relative force of the intrinsic penile muscle. The effective relative force
of the muscle (FI) is calculated as (n x cos θ x a), where n is fiber number, θ is the average fiber
angle with respect to the tendon and a is the average fiber cross-sectional area, The area a is cal-
culated as π(0.5d)2, where d is average fiber diameter. The relative force exerted by the muscle
at the tip of the penis is FI multipled by the mechanical advantage of the muscle at the glans-
shaft joint, Mechanical advantage is LO/LI, where LO is the length of the glans and LI is the
height of the joint.
