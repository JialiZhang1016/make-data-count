Abstract
Predator–­prey dynamics are a fundamental part of ecology, but directly studying inter-
actions has proven difficult. The proliferation of camera trapping has enabled the col-
lection of large datasets on wildlife, but researchers face hurdles inferring interactions 
from observational data. Recent advances in hierarchical co-­abundance models infer 
species interactions while accounting for two species' detection probabilities, shared 
responses to environmental covariates, and propagate uncertainty throughout the 
entire modeling process. However, current approaches remain unsuitable for interact-
ing species whose natural densities differ by an order of magnitude and have contrast-
ing detection probabilities, such as predator–­prey interactions, which introduce zero 
inflation and overdispersion in count histories. Here, we developed a Bayesian hier-
archical N-­mixture co-­abundance model that is suitable for inferring predator–­prey 
interactions. We accounted for excessive zeros in count histories using an informed 
zero-­inflated Poisson distribution in the abundance formula and accounted for over-
dispersion in count histories by including a random effect per sampling unit and sam-
pling occasion in the detection probability formula. We demonstrate that models with 
these modifications outperform alternative approaches, improve model goodness-­
of-­fit, and overcome parameter convergence failures. We highlight its utility using 
20 camera trapping datasets from 10 tropical forest landscapes in Southeast Asia 
and estimate four predator–­prey relationships between tigers, clouded leopards, and 
muntjac and sambar deer. Tigers had a negative effect on muntjac abundance, provid-
ing support for top-­down regulation, while clouded leopards had a positive effect on 
muntjac and sambar deer, likely driven by shared responses to unmodelled covariates 
like hunting. This Bayesian co-­abundance modeling approach to quantify predator–­
prey relationships is widely applicable across species, ecosystems, and sampling ap-
proaches and may be useful in forecasting cascading impacts following widespread 
predator declines. Taken together, this approach facilitates a nuanced and mechanistic 
understanding of food-­web ecology.

1  |  INTRODUCTION
Understanding predator–­prey interactions is a foundational 
theme in ecology (Lotka,  1920; Volterra,  1927). The importance 
of predator–­prey interactions in conservation biology has gained 
widespread attention following the global decline of apex pred-
ators and subsequent trophic cascades (Estes et al.,  2011; Ripple 
et al., 2014). Predators can play keystone roles in structuring eco-
systems by regulating prey populations and the spatiotemporal dis-
tribution of prey via consumptive and behavioral effects (Estes & 
Palmisano, 1974; Gaynor et al., 2019). Where predators exert strong 
top-­down control and suppress prey, predatory interactions can 
produce a negative co-­abundance relationship (Ripple et al., 2014). 
In this scenario, predator extirpation may allow prey to increase, 
termed “trophic release” (Figure  1c; Estes et al.,  2011). However, 
the importance of predators regulating prey across different eco-
systems remains debated (Polis & Strong, 1996; Wright et al., 1994). 
For example, if prey are primarily bottom-­up regulated by limited 
food availability, and predators are consequentially bottom-­up lim-
ited by prey availability, a positive co-­abundance relationship may 
arise, and this has been observed previously (Figure 1a; Carbone & 
Gittleman, 2002; Karanth et al., 2004). A positive predator–­prey co-­
abundance relationship may also suggest alternative forces may be 
more important than predation in regulating species' abundances 
(e.g., bottom-­up control, hunting, or other severe disturbances; Ford 
& Goheen, 2015). Despite the importance of predatory interactions 
in food-­web ecology and conservation, measuring predator–­prey 
relationships in natural settings imposes several key obstacles due 
to direct observations, diet analyses, or manipulative experiments 
being logistically difficult (Smith et al., 2020), especially for cryptic 
species in tropical forests (Brodie & Giordano, 2013).
Ecologists have frequently used observational methods to study 
predation by comparing landscapes that vary in predator and prey 
densities (e.g., Atkins et al., 2019; Brashares et al., 2010; Ripple & 
Beschta, 2006; Terborgh et al., 2001). However, modern sampling 
methods that rely on passively observed occurrence data (e.g., from 
camera traps, acoustic monitors, or eDNA) face numerous analyt-
ical barriers to inferring interactions (Blanchet et al., 2020; Ford & 
Goheen, 2015). Observational studies rarely account for processes 
influencing both predator and prey, such as environmental and 
anthropogenic covariates, the complete absence of either species 
from specific landscapes (i.e., true zeros), and imperfect detection 
of each species (i.e., false zeros), all of which can bias estimates of 
interactions (Blanchet et al., 2020; Blasco-­Moreno et al., 2019). For 
example, generalized joint attribute models can accommodate zero-­
inflated and over-­dispersed data to infer species interactions (Clark 
et al., 2017), but such approaches fail to account for imperfect de-
tection. Recent attempts to use detection-­corrected abundance or 
co-­occurrence models have failed to propagate uncertainly through-
out the modeling process, which may spuriously increase their sta-
tistical power (e.g., Penjor et al., 2022). This leaves a gap in our ability 
to routinely study predator–­prey interactions using observational 
data from standardized biodiversity monitoring programs that now 
often use camera trapping (Jansen et al., 2014). Here we leverage re-
cent advances in collecting large standardized multispecies datasets 
via camera trapping and hierarchical N-­mixture co-­abundance mod-
els to enhance our understanding of complex wildlife interactions in 
natural settings.
Many ecological sampling methods produce multispecies detec-
tion histories (i.e., binary detections or nondetections per sampling 
location and sampling occasion) or count histories (i.e., number of 
individuals counted per sampling location and sampling occasion), 
including point counts, camera trapping, and acoustic sampling. 
Detection and count histories can capture the spatiotemporal pat-
terns of species observed across a landscape and have been used

FI G U R E 1 Hypothetical predator–­prey co-­abundance 
relationships. (a) A positive predator–­prey relationship suggests 
top-­down regulation via predation is not the dominant factor 
shaping abundances. This may arise where there is strong bottom-­
up regulation of both prey and predators or severe disturbances 
affecting both species. (b) The lack of a predator–­prey relationship 
could arise due to a lack of interactions, such as if predator dietary 
preferences exclude a specific prey species or each species utilizes 
different habitats. (c) A negative predator–­prey relationship could 
arise from strong top-­down regulation via predation that regulates 
prey abundance. Similarly, a negative predator–­prey relationship 
suggests predator extirpation may allow prey to increase, termed 
“trophic release”.

to study habitat associations, species distributions, and population 
dynamics (Kéry & Royle, 2016) but have rarely been used to mea-
sure predator–­prey relationships (Kéry & Royle,  2021). Detection 
histories have commonly been used to examine species interactions 
through several varieties of co-­occurrence models that may quantify 
nonindependent occurrence (i.e., symmetrical interactions) within 
the entire community (Tobler et al., 2019) or quantify a directional 
effect where the occurrence of one species is conditional upon 
the presence of another (i.e., asymmetrical interactions; Richmond 
et al., 2010), and both approaches account for imperfect detection. 
By contrast, count histories have received considerably less atten-
tion for inferring species interactions despite carrying more infor-
mation than detection histories (Roth et al., 2016). Recent work by 
Blanchet et al. (2020) outlined numerous concerns about using de-
tection histories to infer species interactions and argued that occur-
rence data does not carry enough information to infer interactions, 
species occurrence depends on their environment (i.e., habitat fil-
tering), and that strong interactions may lead to exclusions before 
interactions can be detected.
Co-­abundance models that use count data instead of occur-
rence data to infer species interactions have solved many of the 
issues raised by Blanchet et al. (2020; Table 1; Brodie et al., 2018; 
Roth et al., 2016). Co-­abundance models are an extension of widely 
used N-­mixture models used to estimate abundance for species 
that cannot be individually identified (Royle,  2004). N-­mixture 
models can generate latent population size estimates that are 
TA B LE 1 Problems and solutions for inferring species interactions from observational data, such as camera trapping capture histories.
Problems inferring predator–­prey interactions
Solutions
Occurrence data (i.e., presence and absence) lacks enough information 
to infer biotic interactions (Blanchet et al., 2020; Roth et al., 2016)
Camera trapping can obtain count data (i.e., number of individuals per 
independent capture) and N-­mixture models utilize count data in 
a count history matrix to estimate abundance while accounting for 
imperfect detection (Royle, 2004)
Need to propagate uncertainty throughout the entire modeling 
process (Brodie & Giordano, 2013)
Use integrated co-­abundance model where all parameters are 
estimated in a single set of simulations using Bayesian Markov 
chain Mote Carlo (MCMC) methods (Brodie et al., 2018; Roth 
et al., 2016)
Species occurrence and abundance depend on the environment 
(i.e., habitat filtering) and the joint habitat preferences of two 
species could falsely create the illusion of interactions (Blanchet 
et al., 2020; Dormann et al., 2018)
Integrate environmental covariates affecting both species into the 
co-­abundance modeling framework (Brodie et al., 2018; Roth 
et al., 2016)
Sampling scale influences measures of co-­occurrence. Spatial scale 
must be fine scale enough to detect interactions between 
individuals, while also encompassing broad variation in species' 
distributions (Blanchet et al., 2020)
Spatially resample camera trap locations to reflect the study species' 
home ranges that ensure detections are spatially independent 
and comparable across camera trapping sessions (Rayan & 
Linkie, 2020). Also, use a large multi-­landscape dataset that 
represents diverse samples of both species' distributions
Appropriate statistical inference requires a very large sample size 
(Blanchet et al., 2020)
Technological and cost improvements have made it possible to conduct 
large, standardized, and repeated camera trapping sessions that 
can collectively generate sufficient sample sizes, even for rare and 
cryptic species. For example, in our case study below, we used data 
from 1210 camera traps from 20 sessions conducted across 10 
landscapes that generated 5980 independent captures of our four 
study species
Strong interactions may lead to complete species exclusions and 
adding zeros to count histories usually leads to deviations from the 
normal Poisson distribution (Blanchet et al., 2020)
Incorporate species absences in count histories and classify zeros as 
true or false zeros (Blasco-­Moreno et al., 2019). Account for true 
zeros (e.g., species extirpated from a landscape) using an informed 
zero-­inflated Poisson distribution, and account for false zeros (e.g., 
present but not detected) by correcting for imperfect detection
Positive correlations between predator and prey abundances are 
difficult to interpret in terms of interspecific interactions (Brodie 
et al., 2018)
Interpret negative predator–­prey relationships as evidence that 
predation is regulating the focal prey population(s) (Ripple 
et al., 2014). Interpret positive predator–­prey relationships as 
evidence that predation is not the primary force regulating the 
focal prey population(s). Positive predator–­prey relationships 
suggest alternative forces (e.g., bottom-­up control, hunting) may be 
more important in shaping the focal prey species abundance (Ford 
& Goheen, 2015)
N-­mixture models are sensitive to model assumption violations 
that can inflate absolute density estimates leading to inaccurate 
inferences for determining population size (Link et al., 2018)
Interpret results from co-­abundance models as the directional change 
in species abundance relative to covariates and not as absolute 
population sizes (Gilbert et al., 2021)
Note: This manuscript describes an approach to implement all solutions.

roughly equivalent to capture-­recapture analyses under ideal sam-
pling conditions (Ficetola et al., 2018), though these models can be 
sensitive to assumption violations that may inflate true population 
density estimates (Link et al., 2018; Nakashima, 2020). The key ad-
vantage of using N-­mixture models is that they accurately quantify 
the spatial variation in abundance as a function of covariates, thus 
producing a relative, rather than absolute, a measure of abundance 
(Gilbert et al., 2021). Currently, co-­abundance models that rely on 
N-­mixture models to infer species interactions have been limited 
to competing species that both occur at similar densities so both 
species' count histories can be assumed to follow a normal Poisson 
distribution (Brodie et al.,  2018; Cosentino et al.,  2019; Easter 
et al., 2020; Roth et al., 2016). Existing co-­abundance models ex-
hibit poor performance and parameter convergence when species 
count histories have vastly different distributions, limiting their ap-
plicability for predators and prey whose natural densities vary by 
an order of magnitude and exhibit considerably different detection 
probabilities (Carbone & Gittleman, 2002; Sollmann et al., 2013). 
Specifically, different population dynamics introduce zero infla-
tion, especially for cryptic species or when species are extirpated 
from a subset of landscapes, and overdispersion in detections, 
which is often due to excessive detections at a subset of sampling 
locations (Blasco-­Moreno et al.,  2019; Martin et al.,  2005). To 
move forward studying predator–­prey interactions from count his-
tories requires addressing both zero inflation and overdispersion, 
while simultaneously accounting for imperfect detection and en-
vironmental covariates, and incorporating uncertainty throughout 
the modeling process.
We developed a Bayesian hierarchical N-­mixture co-­abundance 
model to study predator–­prey interactions while conforming to the 
criteria proposed by Blanchet et al. (2020) for robust inferences 
(Table 1). Our key improvements over existing co-­abundance mod-
els for competition (Brodie et al.,  2018; Cosentino et al.,  2019; 
Easter et al.,  2020) are introducing an informed zero-­inflated 
Poisson distribution in the abundance formula and accounting for 
overdispersion in detections using a random effect per sampling 
unit and sampling occasion in the detection formula. We illustrate 
that the combination of these two methodological advancements 
is necessary to infer ecologically meaningful predator–­prey inter-
actions while ensuring parameter convergence and goodness-­of-­fit 
across several different species pairs. Our co-­abundance models 
facilitate the study of predator–­prey interactions across trophic 
levels by quantifying predator–­prey co-­abundance relationships 
(Figure 1), while accounting for each species' detection probabil-
ity, relationships with environmental covariates, and propagates 
uncertainty. As a real example, we examined four potential pred-
atory interactions using a multi-­session multi-­landscape camera 
trapping dataset from Southeast Asian tropical forests. We quan-
tified predator–­prey co-­abundance relationships to test whether 
tigers (Panthera tigris) or clouded leopards (Neofelis nebulosa and 
N. diardi) suppress sambar deer (Rusa unicolor) or muntjac deer 
(Muntiacus muntjac).
2  |  MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1  |  A two-­species N-­mixture model
Our approach was to test for the effect of a dominant predator's 
local abundance on a subordinate prey's local abundance using count 
histories. We adapted the N-­mixture co-­abundance modeling frame-
work from Brodie et al. (2018) that included a term for the latent 
abundance of a dominant species affecting the abundance of a sub-
ordinate species. This N-­mixture model estimates local abundance 
for species i (either dominant dom or subordinate sub) at sampling 
unit j, denoted as Ni,j, through repeated counts of the population 
over a time frame during which the population is closed to change 
(Royle, 2004). We assume that:
and model the expected count of species i at sampling unit j, λi,j, rela-
tive to covariates using a log-­link function (Royle, 2004). However, we 
expanded upon Brodie et al.'s approach by including informed zero-­
inflated Poisson (hereafter “iZIP”) distributions for both dominant and 
subordinate species to account for true zeros in count history matrices 
when either species was known to be absent. Traditional uniformed ZIP 
N-­mixture models define the occupancy status of species i at sampling 
unit j, Zi,j as a random Bernoulli trial and multiply the expected count of 
species i at sampling unit j, λi,j, by Zi,j (Blasco-­Moreno et al., 2019; Kéry 
& Royle, 2016; Martin et al., 2005). We informed the occupancy status 
of species i at sampling unit j, Zi,j based on our observational camera 
trapping data where Zij was 1 if the sampling unit was in a landscape 
where the species was detected, and Zij was 0 in the event the species 
was never detected and existing literature corroborated their extirpa-
tion (Amir et al., 2022; Blasco-­Moreno et al., 2019; Martin et al., 2005). 
Therefore, our iZIP N-­mixture model assumes that:
Fixing local abundance to zero rather than estimating nonzero abun-
dance where the species was extirpated minimizes the chances of 
making a type I error (Martin et al., 2005).
The effect of the covariates and the dominant on the subordi-
nate species was modeled as:
where αsub is a vector of environmental covariate effects for the 
subordinate and δ represents the effect of the latent abundance per 
sampling unit of the dominant species (Ndom,j) on the subordinate. 
An estimated value of δ < 0 would infer a negative co-­abundance 
relationship between the dominant and subordinate species in sup-
port of a predatory interaction (e.g., top-­down regulation; Figure 1c). 
An estimated value of δ > 0 would infer a positive predator–­prey 
co-­abundance relationship that is likely driven by responses to

unmodelled covariates (e.g., food availability to prey that underlies 
bottom-­up regulation, Figure 1a). Estimates of δ with 95% Bayesian 
credible intervals (CI) overlapping zero do not indicate biologically 
meaningful interactions (Figure  1b). Assuming the covariates in-
cluded in this model are appropriate, this approach allows us to tease 
apart the directional impact of a dominant on subordinate species 
(Brodie et al., 2018). The abundance model for both dominant and 
subordinate species included the iZIP parameter and the same envi-
ronmental covariates, while the subordinates included the additional 
parameter estimating the effect of the latent abundance of the dom-
inant species δ * Ndom,j.
We assume that we imperfectly observed the latent abundance 
of both species during sampling, thus giving rise to false zeros 
in our count histories (Blasco-­Moreno et al.,  2019; Royle,  2004). 
Abundance cannot be directly observed at sampling units, so sam-
pling biases like imperfect detection are accommodated in estimates 
of Ni,j by assuming that the detections of species i at sampling unit j 
during sampling occasion k, denoted as ni,j,k, follow a binomial distri-
bution with species-­level detection probability pi,j,k:
We modeled the detection probability of species i at sampling unit j 
during sampling occasion k, pi,j,k, relative to covariates using a logit-­
link function (Royle, 2004), and we used the same sampling-­related 
covariates in the detection model for both species. The original N-­
mixture model with a binomial detection process assumes that in-
dividuals are not double-­counted between sampling occasions and 
sampling units (Royle, 2004), and this assumption may be violated 
if the same individual is detected multiple times within the same 
sampling occasion. Double counting individuals can lead to inflated 
abundance estimates, so there have been suggestions to address 
this using a Poisson detection process, which we also tested (Link 
et al.,  2018; Nakashima,  2020). To account for overdispersion in 
species-­specific detection probability not captured by sampling-­
related covariates, we included a random effect per sampling unit 
and sampling occasion (an overdispersion random effect, hereafter 
“ODRE”) per species, εi,j,k (Kéry & Royle, 2016; Roth et al., 2016). For 
the ODRE, we assume that:
where τi was the standard deviation of the ODRE. We also included a 
stabilizing parameter to ensure the logit-­link transformation would not 
become zero or negative (Kéry & Royle, 2016). Bringing the sampling-­
related covariates and ODRE together, we define the detection proba-
bility of species i at sampling unit j on sampling occasion k as:
We estimated model parameters using a Bayesian approach 
with MCMC methods with the program R (R Development Core 
Team,  2021) in the package “jagsUI” (Kellner,  2019). We used this 
Bayesian approach to propagate uncertainty throughout the model-
ing process by first estimating the latent abundance of the dominant 
species per sampling unit, Ndom,j, which is then used as a covariate to 
estimate the latent abundance of the subordinate per sampling unit, 
Nsub,j (Brodie et al., 2018; Roth et al., 2016). As our primary goal for 
this N-­mixture co-­abundance model was the examine the directional 
impact of a dominant species' local abundance upon a subordinate 
species' local abundance, and not to estimate latent population sizes, 
we refrain from interpreting our results in terms of absolute density 
but rather as the spatial variation in abundance relative to covariates 
(i.e., δ * Ndomj,k; Gilbert et al., 2021). Apart from our iZIP parameter (Zij), 
we used uninformative prior values and provided similar initial values 
close to zero for all parameters. For each species pair, we ran three 
chains of 1,000,000 iterations because Kéry and Royle (2016) stressed 
the importance of running long chains when incorporating the ODRE. 
We discarded the first 200,000 iterations as burn-­in and thinned the 
chains by 80, which left 30,000 values to quantify the posterior distri-
bution of each parameter. We assumed parameters converged if their 
Rhat scores were between 1 and 1.2 (Gelman et al., 2013). We calcu-
lated the 95% CI from the posterior distribution and considered our 
parameters to have a clear effect (or “significant effect” in frequentist 
terminology) if 0 was not included in the 95% CI (Roth et al., 2016). 
To infer confidence about parameter directionality, we calculated the 
probability the posterior distribution of the species interaction param-
eter was either negative or positive using the R package “bayestestR” 
(Makowski et al., 2019). Finally, our model has the same assumptions as 
a standard N-­mixture model, including independence among sampling 
units, population closure over all replicated sampling occasions, inde-
pendent and equal detection probabilities among individuals within a 
species, and that abundance per sampling unit was a random variable 
with E(Nj) = λ (Royle, 2004).
2.2  |  Evaluating model performance
We assessed model performance by inspecting model goodness-­
of-­fit and the magnitude of overdispersion by calculating “Bayesian 
p-­values” and “C-­hat” scores via χ2 discrepancies using posterior 
predictive checks (PPC) (Conn et al.,  2018; Gelman et al.,  1996). 
The PPC simulates a count history matrix from the joint posterior 
distribution and estimates the level of consistency with the ob-
served count history matrix. Bayesian p-­values reflect the propor-
tion of times the simulated data were greater than the observed 
data, and C-­hat values reflect the magnitude of overdispersion by 
dividing the observed data by the simulated data. Bayesian p-­values 
between .25 and .75 indicate a good fit, values that equal 0.5 indi-
cate a perfect fit, and values outside this range indicate a lack of fit 
(Conn et al., 2018; Gelman et al., 1996; Kéry & Royle, 2016) and C-­
hat values greater than 1.1 suggest remaining overdispersion (Kéry 
& Royle, 2016; Mazerolle, 2020). Finally, we assessed Bayesian p-­
values, C-­hat scores, and the species interaction parameter using

2.3  |  Example: Southeast Asian predator–­
prey dynamics
2.3.1  |  Camera trapping methods
We assessed predator–­prey co-­abundance relationships using 
a large multi-­session multi-­landscape camera trap dataset from 
Southeast Asian tropical forests. We conducted 20 camera trap-
ping sessions in ten lowland primary tropical forest landscapes 
in Sumatra (3), Borneo (2), Singapore (1), Peninsular Malaysia 
(2), and Thailand (2) (Table  S1). We refer to sampling areas as a 
“landscape” and these all include protected areas as well as some 
nearby production forests and forest patches. For detailed land-
scape descriptions, see Amir et al. (2022). At each landscape, we 
deployed 22–­112 passive infrared camera traps set across areas 
of 48–­830 km2. We standardized camera deployment between 
landscapes using either Reconyx or Bushnell cameras attached to 
trees at 0.2–­0.3 m height and placed along natural wildlife trails 
without baits (Jansen et al., 2014). We deployed cameras for ap-
proximately 30–­90 days (mean = 40.4, SD = 31.6) to ensure popu-
lation closure assumptions.
We systematically deployed camera traps in each landscape in 
a grid format and then spatially resampled the camera traps into 
7.8 km2 hexagonal sampling units due to unequal camera spacing 
between large continuous forests (>1 km between cameras) and 
small forest fragments (<500 m between cameras). Resampling 
all camera traps into spatially standardized sampling units en-
sures comparability among landscapes, prevents spatial pseudo-­
replication, and ensures that we are estimating abundance as 
opposed to habitat use (Rayan & Linkie, 2020). When multiple cam-
eras occurred in a single sampling unit, we averaged their covari-
ate values and aggregated the number of individuals observed per 
day. We considered captures of the same species independent if 
they occurred at least 30 min apart (Rovero & Zimmermann, 2016). 
We grouped our count data into 5-­day sampling occasions to de-
crease the number of false zeros in the dataset (i.e., sampling oc-
casions with no detections) and increase detection probabilities 
(Brodie et al., 2018).
2.3.2  |  Study species
Tigers (Panthera tigris) are the largest carnivores distributed across 
Southeast Asia, and clouded leopards (Neofelis nebulosa and N. di-
ardi, analyzed as one species) are large carnivores that co-­occur 
with tigers across mainland Southeast Asia and Sumatra but are 
the largest carnivores in Borneo where tigers are no longer na-
tive (Phillipps & Phillipps, 2016). We only included count data from 
landscapes where the predator species is native, which allowed 
us to incorporate landscapes where the species is extirpated (e.g., 
tigers in Singapore) and exclude landscapes where the species is 
not native (e.g., tigers in Borneo, Amir et al., 2022). Sambar deer 
(Rusa unicolor) and muntjac deer (Muntiacus muntjak) deer are com-
mon large ungulates widely distributed through our study region. 
For gregarious muntjac deer (20+ individuals per sampling occa-
sion), we followed Brodie et al. (2018) by analyzing the number of 
muntjac groups rather than the number of individuals in the count 
history and limited the daily observations to zero or one group. A 
systematic range-­wide dietary study suggests tigers preferentially 
prey upon the largest available prey species with a weight range 
from 60 to 250 kg, such as sambar deer (Hayward et al.,  2012), 
while single-­landscape studies highlight muntjac deer as an im-
portant prey species for clouded leopards (Can et al.,  2020; 
Petersen et al.,  2020). Therefore, we expected strong negative 
co-­abundance relationships between tigers and sambar deer and 
between clouded leopards and muntjac deer in support of preda-
tory interactions.
2.3.3  |  Covariates
While there are many factors that affect species abundance, our 
analysis focused on a limited set of powerful composite variables. 
To account for environmental and anthropogenic disturbances that 
may affect species abundance, we included the Forest Landscape 
Integrity Index (FLII) and Human Footprint Index (HFP) as fixed ef-
fect covariates on the abundance formula for both species. The FLII 
is a globally continuous measure of the world's forests that inte-
grates both observed deforestation and inferred edge effects and 
the loss of connectivity (Grantham et al., 2020). The HFP is a globally 
continuous measure that represents landscape-­level anthropogenic 
disturbances from human population densities and infrastructure, 
and can be used as a crude metric to infer potential hunting pres-
sure (Venter et al., 2016). We calculated FLII and HFP values in QGIS 
for every camera trap location. We also included a random-­intercept 
effect in our abundance formula to account for unmodeled varia-
tion between landscapes and to account for three landscapes with 
repeated sampling. Finally, we included a fixed effect for sampling 
effort (in trap nights) per sampling unit in our detection probability 
formula to account for multiple cameras being resampled into the 
same sampling unit and unequal deployment lengths. We standard-
ized all numeric covariates (mean = 0, SD = 1) and examined Pearson 
correlation coefficients, and ensured no collinearity among covari-
ates (|r| < 0.5). The abundance formula modeled the expected count 
relative to environmental covariates for species i at sampling unit j 
as follows:
log(λi,j
) = 훼0i + 훼1i
∗FLIIj + 훼2i
∗HFPj + 훼3i

Note: We started with the original two-­species N-­mixture model developed by Brodie et al. (2018) (Poisson). We compared this to models using either 
the informed zero-­inflated Poisson distribution (iZIP), or a random effect per sampling unit and sampling occasion (OD), and to the models presented 
in the main text using both (iZIP + OD). The species interaction column shows the posterior distribution's mean and standard deviation of the species 
interaction parameter, and Rhat values between 1 and 1.2 denote that the parameter successfully converged. Bayesian p-­values between .25 and .75 
indicate a suitable goodness-­of-­fit, a value of .5 indicates a perfect fit, and values outside this range indicate unacceptable performance. C-­hat values 
greater than 1.1 indicate unacceptable overdispersion.

3  |  RESULTS
3.1  |  Model performance
Our co-­abundance modeling approach that accounted for zero in-
flation and overdispersion in count histories using both the iZIP 
distribution and ODRE successfully converged across all species 
pairs (Rhat <1.2; Table 2; Figure 2). Including either the iZIP and 
ODRE parameters improved model goodness-­of-­fit (Bayesian p-­
values were closer to .5 than models lacking these parameters, 
Figure  3a) and reduced overdispersion (C-­hat values were be-
tween 1.1 and 1.0; Figure 3b) compared with models that lacked 
one or both improvements. Including both the iZIP and ODRE pa-
rameters improved model performance the most, as illustrated by 
the highest convergence around the species interaction param-
eter, Bayesian p-­values closest to .5, and C-­hat values that suggest 
no remaining overdispersion. The key exception was for the model 
examining the impact of tigers on sambar deer, which showed im-
proved convergence and a clear species interaction effect when 
omitting the iZIP distribution and including the ODRE (Table 2b). 
Co-­abundance models using a Poisson instead of a binomial detec-
tion process produced lower absolute population size estimates 
for most species but followed the same relative abundance trends 
between landscapes (Figure S1) and equivalent directionality for 
our species interaction parameter (δ * Ndom,j; Figure S2). However, 
using a Poisson detection formula models exhibited unaccep-
table goodness-­of-­fit (Bayesian p-­values >.75) for two-­species 
pairs (Figure S3) and reduced precision of the species interaction 
parameter that undermined its biological and applicable utility. 
Therefore, we present co-­abundance models using the binomial 
detection formula in the main text and the Poisson detection for-
mula in the supplement.

We collected 5980 independent captures of our four study spe-

4  |  DISCUSSION
We introduced a two-­species N-­mixture modeling approach to 
quantify predator–­prey relationships from observational count his-
tories, while accounting for shared responses to the environment 
and propagating uncertainty throughout the modeling process. We 
assessed how this model performed using camera trapping data of 
two Asian apex predators and two of their key prey species that ex-
hibit contrasting detection probabilities and natural densities. We 
found that explicitly classifying both the source of true zeros with 
the iZIP distribution in the abundance formula and false zeros with 
our detection formula containing the ODRE were necessary to infer 
ecologically meaningful predator–­prey interactions while ensur-
ing parameter convergence across all species pairs (Blasco-­Moreno 
et al., 2019; Martin et al., 2005). Failing to classify true zeros, such 
as at landscapes where a species has been extirpated, leaves the 
model to estimate nonzero abundance due to imperfect detection 
(i.e., false zeros) that leads to overconfidence in the posterior esti-
mates and increases the risk of a type I error (Martin et al., 2005). We 
illustrated this type I error by showing a spurious clear positive re-
lationship between tigers and sambar deer when excluding the iZIP 
parameter, which disappeared when using the iZIP distribution. Our 
approach also produced relationships with environmental covariates 
across all species that are supported by past research suggesting 
anthropogenic pressure suppresses ungulate abundances and that 
intact tropical forests support large carnivore abundances (Hearn 
et al., 2019; Luskin, Albert, & Tobler, 2017; Macdonald et al., 2019; 
Rayan & Linkie, 2020).
There is a strong appetite to infer species interactions from 
camera trap data and to overcome the limitations of traditional co-­
occurrence models (Blanchet et al., 2020). While our approach is 
fit-­for-­purpose, there are several drawbacks including these mod-
els being data hungry, computationally demanding, and statisti-
cally complicated. To overcome data limitations, such as for tigers 
in our datasets that were only detected only in three of ten sam-
pled landscapes, collaborative projects may be required to achieve 
sufficient sample sizes and span a wide gradient of predator 
abundances. Another solution may be to integrate multiple data 
sources such as direct observations with camera trapping (Miller 
et al., 2019). The computational power required to run and test 
several models with 1,000,000 MCMC iterations may pose a con-
siderable barrier for many field ecologists (Pettorelli et al., 2021). 
Access to high-­performance research computing that simulta-
neously solves multiple models while distributing MCMC chains 
across multiple cores will save researchers a substantial amount 
of time in such analyses (Visser et al.,  2015). Finally, there are 
concerns about the reliability of N-­mixture models when assump-
tions are violated, such as when the same individual is observed 
multiple times in a single sampling occasion (Link et al.,  2018). 
This violation can cause inflation in absolute population size es-
timates, so if researchers require accurate latent population size 
estimates, we encourage the use of a Poisson detection process 
(Nakashima, 2020). We implemented co-­abundance models with 
both binomial and Poisson detection processes and observed 
equivalent directionality and similar species interaction parame-
ters, suggesting either detection process may be suitable for ex-
amining the spatial variation in abundance (Gilbert et al., 2021).
Predator losses in temperate ecosystems often lead to trophic 
release, where a subset of prey species increase in abundance 
(Ripple et al., 2009), but predator–­prey relationships appear weak or 
positive in tropical forests (Brodie & Giordano, 2013). Predator–­prey 
relationships in tropical forests may be strongly shaped by diffuse 
food webs with functionally redundant links, strong bottom-­up con-
trol, and/or the joint suppression of many animals by overwhelming 
disturbances such as defaunation (Benítez-­López et al., 2019; Brodie 
& Giordano, 2013; Polis & Strong, 1996; Wright et al., 1994). In ac-
cordance with this work, we found only one clear negative relation-
ship suggesting tigers regulate muntjac deer. Further, we detected 
positive predator–­prey relationships between clouded leopards 
and both muntjac and sambar deer, suggesting predation is not the 
dominant force regulating Asia's deer. Instead, prey abundance may 
be a fundamental determinant of predator abundance (Carbone & 
Gittleman, 2002; Karanth et al., 2004) with deer being noted as key 
prey for clouded leopards (Can et al., 2020; Petersen et al., 2020). 
These results also suggest that hunting deer may suppress clouded 
leopards via prey depletion (Wolf & Ripple, 2016), or hunting may 
jointly suppress clouded leopards and deer together (Benítez-­López 
et al., 2019; Ford & Goheen, 2015). Future research could apply our 
modeling approach to reverse the role of dominant and subordinate 
species to examine whether the abundance of clouded leopards is 
positively associated with deer abundance, thereby testing support 
for bottom-­up regulation.
This modeling framework is widely applicable across species, 
ecosystems, and sampling approaches (acoustic monitoring, camera 
trapping, and point counts) that produce count histories. A key im-
provement of our co-­abundance modeling approach that classifies 
the source of zeros in count histories is to move trophic cascades 
research past binary comparisons of landscapes based on predator 
presence or absence (e.g., Atkins et al., 2019; Brashares et al., 2010) 
to a gradient of predator abundance, including where predators are 
absent. Our modeling framework incorporates covariates and has 
the potential to explain divergent co-­abundance patterns across 
environmental gradients, such as edge-­adapted and disturbance-­
tolerant species proliferating in predator-­free forest fragments 
(Terborgh et al., 2001). Future research could use this co-­abundance 
model to examine how predator–­prey relationships vary across eco-
logical gradients, which has important conservation implications for 
predicting trophic cascades (Terborgh, 2015).

5  |  CONCLUSION
Our study provides ecologists with a modeling approach to infer 
predatory interactions from observationally collected count data 
across multiple landscapes. This remarkably flexible approach opens 
novel opportunities to evaluate species interactions across natural 
or disturbance gradients, including when species abundances vary 
or where some sites experienced extirpations. There is direct ap-
plicability to ongoing predator conservation and trophic cascades 
research as our study species continue to experience range contrac-
tions. We look forward to opportunities to ground truth the results 
from our approach by co-­locating camera trapping studies with ma-
nipulative experiments (e.g., predator reintroductions) and direct 
predation observations.
