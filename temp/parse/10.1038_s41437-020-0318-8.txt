Abstract
The central aim of evolutionary biology is to understand patterns of genetic variation between species and within
populations. To quantify the genetic variation underlying intraspeciﬁc differences, estimating quantitative genetic parameters
of traits is essential. In Pterygota, wing morphology is an important trait affecting ﬂight ability. Moreover, gregarious
parasitoids such as Nasonia vitripennis oviposit multiple eggs in the same host, and siblings thus share a common
environment during their development. Here we estimate the genetic parameters of wing morphology in the outbred HVRx
population of N. vitripennis, using a sire-dam model adapted to haplodiploids and disentangled additive genetic and host
effects. The results show that the wing-size traits have low heritability (h2 ~ 0.1), while most wing-shape traits have roughly
twice the heritability compared with wing-size traits. However, the estimates increased to h2 ~ 0.6 for wing-size traits when
omitting the host effect from the statistical model, while no meaningful increases were observed for wing-shape traits.
Overall, host effects contributed to ~50% of the variation in wing-size traits. This indicates that hosts have a large effect on
wing-size traits, about ﬁvefold more than genetics. Moreover, bivariate analyses were conducted to derive the genetic
relationships among traits. Overall, we demonstrate the evolutionary potential for morphological traits in the N. vitripennis
HVRx-outbred population, and report the host effects on wing morphology. Our ﬁndings can contribute to a further
dissection of the genetics underlying wing morphology in N. vitripennis, with relevance for gregarious parasitoids and
possibly other insects as well.
Introduction
Winged insects, Pterygota, are often considered to be the
most successful terrestrial arthropods. The ability to exploit
new habitats and fast dispersal by ﬂight have been recog-
nized as the main causes of their ecological and evolu-
tionary success (Mayhew 2007). Many studies have shown
that wing morphology, e.g., wing size and shape, is an
important determinant of aerodynamic effects on ﬂight per-
formance, and thus strongly inﬂuences ﬂight behaviour and
ﬁtness (Wootton 1992; Berwaerts et al. 2002; Dudley 2002).
In general, long and narrow wings give greater speed and
endurance of ﬂight, while short and wide wings give higher
manoeuvrability (Norberg and Rayner 1987; Betts and
Wootton 1988; Wootton 1992; Dudley 2002). Thus, depend-
ing on biological and physical environmental conditions,
natural selection is expected to result in wing morphology
adaptations. It is, therefore, important to understand how wing
morphology can actually evolve under natural selection.
One way to study the ability of wing morphology to
respond to natural selection, is to investigate the quantita-
tive genetic components of variation in wing morphology.
Phenotypic variation in morphological traits observed
among individuals or between populations of the same
species can result from genetic and environmental factors
(Falconer and Mackay 1996; Lynch and Walsh 1998). The
presence of additive genetic variance for wing morphology
in natural populations is a necessary condition for a phe-
notypic response to natural selection. The magnitude of the

additive genetic variance is commonly expressed as the
narrow-sense heritability (h2), the relative fraction of the
total phenotypical variation due to additive genetic variation
in a population. When heritability is high, phenotypic var-
iation is mostly due to additive (i.e., heritable) effects of
genes (Falconer and Mackay 1996; Lynch and Walsh
1998). Another parameter commonly used in evolutionary
studies to express the extent of additive genetic variance, is
the evolvability (Houle 1992). Evolvability has been widely
used to compare the evolutionary potential of natural
populations, and gives an indication of the capacity of a
population to respond to selection when the environment
changes (Houle 1992). Evolvability in quantitative genetics
is measured as the coefﬁcient of additive genetic variation
(CVA), which standardizes the additive genetic standard
deviation by the trait mean rather than the phenotypic var-
iation. In addition, the short-term response to natural
selection depends not only on the heritabilities of the traits,
but also on the genetic and phenotypic covariances among
traits (Lande and Arnold 1983; Falconer and Mackay 1996;
Lynch and Walsh 1998). Genetic correlations result from
pleiotropy or linkage among genes controlling traits, and
their values and signs measure the ability of traits to evolve
independently. A non-zero genetic correlation presents a
constraint (e.g., it reduces the response to multi-trait selec-
tion in the direction opposite to the genetic correlation), and
it can also create a trade-off (e.g., selection for a trait may
cause an unfavourable correlated response in another trait).
Thus, to understand how multiple traits can evolve together,
it is crucial to understand all their quantitative genetic
parameters.
Nasonia is a genus of gregarious parasitoid wasps of
blowﬂy pupae (Whiting 1967), and includes four species: N.
vitripennis, N. longicornis, N. giraulti and N. oneida
(Werren et al. 2010). They are often used as model species
in developmental and evolutionary genetics (Werren et al.
2010). All Nasonia species have large wings and are cap-
able of ﬂight, except for N. vitripennis males that have small
vestigial wings and are unable to ﬂy (Weston et al. 1999;
Loehlin et al. 2010a). The genetic basis of this interspeciﬁc
difference in male wing size has been extensively investi-
gated (Weston et al. 1999; Gadau et al. 2002; Loehlin et al.
2010a; Loehlin et al. 2010b), which has greatly improved
our understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying
the wing size and shape differences between Nasonia spe-
cies. However, no studies are available on quantitative
genetic parameters for wing morphology within Nasonia
species.
Compared with diploid species, relatively few studies on
quantitative genetic parameters have been conducted in
haplodiploids, such as Nasonia or other parasitoid wasps
(Peire Morais 2007; Shuker et al. 2007). Similar to other
Hymenoptera,
Nasonia
has
a
haplodiploid
sex
determination system (Whiting 1967), in which males
develop from unfertilized eggs and are haploid, while
females develop from fertilized eggs and are diploid. Thus,
in haplodiploids, fathers only contribute genes to daughters,
and quantitative genetic analysis of haplodiploids, such as
Nasonia, needs to be adjusted to account for the resulting
genetic relationships among individuals (Liu and Smith
2000).
Moreover, Nasonia is a gregarious parasitoid, which can
lay up to 60 eggs in a single Dipteran pupa (Whiting 1967).
This could create environmental similarity between off-
spring developing within the same pupa (here referred to as
“host”), which needs to be accounted for in the statistical
model to avoid confounding environmental with genetic
effects. In addition to statistical confounding, the quality of
the hosts is crucial for development and size, and also
affects adult longevity and fecundity (Godfray 1994).
Therefore, host quality can generate variation and inﬂuence
the genetic architecture of the traits. Thus, a common
environment effect (i.e., host effect) should be included in
the analysis, not only to avoid the inﬂation of genetic
parameter estimates, but also to quantify its effect on trait
variation.
To quantify the potential of wing morphology in Nasonia
to respond to (multi-trait) natural selection, we constructed a
population consisting of half-sib families and estimated the
quantitative genetic parameters of intraspeciﬁc variation in
wing size and shape in an outbred population of Nasonia
vitripennis. Our main objective is to partition phenotypic
(co)variation in size and shape traits into genetic and non-
genetic components. For this purpose, we adapted the linear
mixed model known as the “animal model” (Henderson
1984; Kruuk 2004) to haplodiploids (1) to estimate the
genetic parameters for wing traits, i.e., heritabilities, coef-
ﬁcients of additive genetic variance and genetic correla-
tions, and (2) to quantify the host effect.
Materials and methods
Nasonia stock
We used the N. vitripennis HVRx-outbred population,
which was established from strains collected from a single-
ﬁeld population in the Netherlands (van de Zande et al.
2014). To preserve genetic diversity across generations, the
HVRx stock is maintained in the laboratory according to a
ﬁxed schedule, in which ~120 mated females in total are
transferred to four new mass culture tubes to initiate the
next generation (van de Zande et al. 2014). Per tube, 50
hosts (Calliphora vomitoria ﬂy pupae) are provided for
oviposition. To ensure optimal mixing of the wasps, the
parasitized hosts are re-distributed over four new mass

culture tubes before offspring emerge. Approximately
14 days are needed to complete a cycle at 25 °C and a 16-h
light, 8-h dark scheme.
Experimental design
We generated a family structure to allow estimation of
genetic parameters using a mixed linear model and pedigree
relationships among individuals (Henderson 1984). Half-sib
families were created by making mating groups of one male
(sire) with ﬁve virgin females (dams). To collect virgin
wasps, a large number of parasitized hosts from the mass-
reared outbred population were opened, and male and
female pupae were collected separately, ~3 days before
emergence. Following emergence, we put one male and ﬁve
females in one tube and allowed them to mate for 2 days.
After mating, we placed each female individually into a new
tube with two host pupae, in order to split larval environ-
ments (i.e., the host) within full-sib families. After 2 days of
oviposition, we removed the female and placed the hosts in
separate tubes kept at 25 °C and a 16-h light, 8-h dark
regime. Female offspring was enclosed after 13 or 14 days.
From each host, we collected three female offspring,
yielding six experimental daughters per full-sib family. In
total, 1889 individuals were used in this study, including
55 sires, 265 dams and 1569 female offspring. All of the
hosts used in this study were provided by a single com-
mercial supplier in a single batch.
Morphological trait measurements
The right forewing and right hind tibia of 1569 female
offspring were dissected and mounted in Euparal (Waldeck
GmbH & Co. KG, Division Chroma, Münster, Germany)
under coverslips on microscope slides. The right hind tibia
was collected in this study, because tibia length can be used
as a proxy of body size for parasitoids (Godfray 1994). We
used tibia length to scale wing size, so as to remove the
correlation between the wing and body size. Slides were
photographed on a Zeiss Imager.A1 microscope (Zeiss AG,
Göttingen, Germany) at ×2.5 magniﬁcation. Data for wing
size, shape and tibia length were obtained by positioning
landmarks on each digitized wing using tpsDig software
(Rohlf 2013), which expresses landmarks as x and y coor-
dinates in Cartesian space. Six landmarks were located on
the spike and the joint points of the hind tibia (Fig. 1a), and
11 landmarks on the wing setae, on the wing margin and on
the free ends of wing veins (Fig. 1b). To check the con-
sistency of where we placed the landmark positions, we
estimated the repeatability by re-measuring ~100 wings.
A very high repeatability (~0.98) was obtained, which
indicates that positioning of the landmarks is highly

repeatable and consistent. The wing-size traits and tibia
length were calculated from the distance between two
landmarks using their coordinates (Table 1).
Compared with wing size, wing shape is more difﬁcult to
deﬁne, and we assessed wing-shape variation using different
methods. First, wing shape was calculated as the aspect ratio,
which was deﬁned as wing length divided by wing width.
Second, we investigated wing shape as scaled wing length
and width in which both traits were scaled to the tibia length.
In addition, we also quantiﬁed wing shape using geometric
morphometrics, in which the raw coordinates digitized by
tpsDig were analyzed in MorphoJ (version 1.07a, Klingen-
berg 2011). In MorphoJ, the Procrustes superimposition cre-
ated a consensus wing shape using all 11 landmarks for all
individuals. A principal component analysis (PCA) was per-
formed using the covariance matrix of the Procrustes shape
coordinates. Eigenvalues, percentages of variance explained
for each PCA and the ﬁrst two eigenvectors are shown in
Supplementary Table S1–2 and Fig. S1. The individual ﬁrst
four principal components were used to assess wing-shape
variation. Similar heritabilities were found for all four com-
ponents. We thus only reported the results for the ﬁrst com-
ponent, referred to as “wing shape PC” in the following. In
total, eight morphological traits were analyzed, including one
body-size trait (tibia length), three wing-size traits (wing
length, width and surface) and four wing-shape traits (aspect
ratio, scaled wing length, width and wing-shape PC).
Data analysis
Variance components
In total, records of 1569 individuals, representing 55 half-
sib and 265 full-sib families, were analyzed for the above
eight morphological traits. Data were analyzed with a linear
mixed sire and dam model. We used a sire-dam model,
rather than a full-animal model, because relationships
between paternal sibs differ from those between maternal
sibs in haplodiploids (see below, a ﬁtted full-animal model
using an inverted haplodiploid relationship matrix yielded
identical results). In addition, host identity was included in
the model, because individuals developing in the same host
share the same environment, and are full siblings that may
show a dominance covariance. An analysis with a perma-
nent dam effect for all offspring of the same mother was
also performed, but the dam effect was small and not sta-
tistically signiﬁcant. Hence, the permanent dam effect was
not included in the statistical model. Therefore, in matrix
notation, our ﬁnal model was
y ¼ u þ ðZsus þ ZdudÞ þ Zcc þ e;
where y = the vector of observed traits, us = a vector of
sire-additive genetic effects, ud = a vector of dam-additive
genetic effects, c = a vector of host effects (“common
environment” effects) and e = a vector of residual errors.
u was the overall mean of phenotypic records. The sire (us),
dam (ud), and host effect (c) were taken as normally
distributed and independent random effects. Zs, Zd and Zc
were known design matrices assigning observations to the
level of us, ud and c, respectively.
In haplodiploids, female offspring of the same (haploid)
father all share his full paternal haplotype. For this reason, the
sire variance in the above model equals half of the additive
genetic variance. Female offspring of the same (diploid)
mother, in contrast, share only 50% of their maternal hap-
lotype because of Mendelian segregation and recombination.
Thus, as in diploids, the dam variance in the above model
equals one-quarter of the additive genetic variance. Thus, the
above sire-dam model is a type of reduced animal model
(Quaas and Pollak 1980), but the dam variance equals half
the sire variance, σ2
d ¼ 0:5 σ2
s. We forced the dam variance to
be equal to half the sire variance in our sire-dam model, and
calculated the additive genetic variance as twice the sire
variance,

In addition, some wing-shape traits were deﬁned as the
ratio between two size traits (e.g., aspect ratio = wing
length/width). To avoid the concern over autocorrelation,
we log-transformed all traits and repeated the above ana-
lysis with transforming data. We also calculated allometry
slopes to examine the patterns of allometry in these traits
(Supplementary Information).
Results
All morphological traits measured in the outbred HVRx
N. vitripennis population exhibited variation (Table 2). The
outcomes of the likelihood-ratio test for signiﬁcance of
variance components are presented in Table 3. All wing and
tibia traits showed signiﬁcant evidence of additive genetic
effects (LRT: p < 0.05, Table 3). Apart from wing-shape
PC, the estimates of heritability for wing-shape traits are
about twice as large as the heritabilities for wing-size traits,
around 0.10 for size traits and 0.25 for wing-shape traits. In
contrast to the heritabilities, estimates of evolvability are
slightly larger for wing-size traits than for wing-shape traits.
Hence, when genetic variability is expressed relative to the
mean trait value rather than the total phenotypic variance,
wing-size traits show the most additive genetic variation.
Remarkably, large host effects (c2) were found for size
traits, but not for wing-shape traits (Table 3). Host effects
explain more than 50% of phenotypic variance for wing-
size traits, whereas host effects explain only less than 10%
for wing-shape traits.
Phenotypic and genetic correlations were consistent for
all pairs of traits (Table 4). Both phenotypic and genetic
correlations among wing-size traits are very high, close to 1.
The high correlations suggest the existence of both genetic
and non-genetic factors that are common to wing-size traits,
so that individuals with, e.g., longer wings, also tend to
have wider wings and a larger wing surface. Similarly, tibia
length showed a high positive correlation with wing-size
traits, both phenotypically and genetically. Some signiﬁcant

correlations were also found among wing-shape traits. For
instance, the genetic and phenotypic correlations are high
between scaled wing length and width, as 0.83 and 0.84,
respectively. In contrast, most genetic correlations between
size and wing-shape traits were not signiﬁcant.
In addition, we found similar heritabilities and correla-
tions for the log-transformed traits as for the original traits
(supplementary Table S5–6). We therefore only show
results derived from original traits in the following discus-
sion because they have real biological meaning. We also
show the allometry relationships between all traits (Sup-
plementary Table S7). For instance, wing surface has a
positive allometry with tibia length as α > 1, which means
wing surface grows faster than tibia length. While the rest of
traits grow slower than tibia length and have a negative
allometry with tibia length as α < 1.
Discussion
In order to understand genetic variation in wing morphol-
ogy in Pterygota insects, we estimated genetic parameters
for wing size and shape in an outbred population of N.
vitripennis. Low- (~0.10) -to-moderate (~0.25) heritabilities
were found for wing-size and wing-shape traits. However,
evolvabilities of all of the traits measured as their CVA were
low, ranging from 1.19 to 2.68%. Our evolvability estimates
agree with Houle (1992), who observed similar values for
wing length in Drosophila melanogaster. The similarity
between estimates of evolvability for wing morphology
indicates that wing morphology traits have a low capacity to
respond to selection when the response is measured relative
to the trait average.
Wing-size traits generally had lower heritabilities com-
pared with wing-shape traits (Table 3). An explanation for
these lower heritabilities is the large host effect. We could
disentangle additive genetic effects from host effects
because (i) our data contained both full- and half-siblings,
and (ii) each full-sib family emerged from two distinct
hosts. The results show that the host environment (indicated
by c2) had a large and highly signiﬁcant effect, and
explained about half of phenotypic variance for wing- and
body-size traits, but not for wing-shape traits (Table 3).
Wing-shape traits, including aspect ratio, scaled wing length
and width, were deﬁned as the ratio of size traits, and thus
the host effects on them had been scaled out, leading to
smaller phenotypic variance. Small host effects were also
found for wing-shape PC, which is a size-free trait (i.e., this
PC was estimated based only on coordinates in Cartesian
space and not on size traits). Thus, host effects have only
limited impact on wing-shape traits. In contrast to wing-
shape traits, developing in the same host generated an
increased similarity of wing-size traits between siblings.
This ﬁnding suggests that natural selection may have only
limited access to the genetic variation for these traits
because most of the phenotype on which selection may act
is due to the developmental host. It is therefore important to
investigate the causes of this host effect, for instance,
through the hosts’ nutritional composition, as well as how
(genetic variation for) the mother’s host selection behaviour
exerts selection on the wing size and shape phenotype of her
offspring (see below).
In addition, the large host effects may also explain the
low heritability estimates compared with other studies. We
have found no other studies on the quantitative genetics of
wing morphology in Nasonia. However, much higher her-
itability estimates of wing traits have been reported in
Drosophila and other winged insect species (Messina 1993;
Hoffmann and Schiffer 1998; Bitner-Mathe and Klaczko
1999a; Matta and Bitner-Mathe 2004; Moraes et al. 2004;
Moraes and Sene 2004). For example, estimated herit-
abilities for female wing length and width were 0.65 and
0.58, respectively, in Drosophila melanogaster (Hoffmann
and Schiffer 1998), while heritability estimates of the aspect

ratio range from 0.30 to 0.62 (Bitner-Mathe and Klaczko
1999a; Matta and Bitner-Mathe 2004; Moraes et al. 2004).
The relatively low heritabilities found in our study indicate
either lower genetic variance and/or higher non-genetic
variance in our population. The estimate of evolvability
(CVA) for wing length in Nasonia is similar to the value
found in Drosophila melanogaster (1.22 in Nasonia vs.
1.56 in Drosophila, Houle 1992). These similar CVA esti-
mates suggest that the level of genetic variation may not be
the main reason of low heritabilities found in our study.
Furthermore, the larval densities in Drosophila heritability
studies are generally all controlled, reducing the variance
introduced by larval competition. Similar to the host effect
observed in our study, several studies have shown an effect
of larval densities on Drosophila morphological traits,
including wing morphology (DeMoed et al. 1997; Bitner-
Mathe and Klaczko 1999b).
Interestingly, when omitting the host effect from the
statistical model, the estimated heritability for wing length,
for example, increased by a factor of eight (from 0.07 to
0.58). This result shows that inclusion of a host effect is
essential when estimating genetic parameters for size-
related traits in Nasonia. The effect of host quality on
parasitoid size has been reported long ago (see Godfray
1994). Rivers and Denlinger (1994) also reported an effect
of the host on body size in N. vitripennis, where body size
increases with the weight of the host. It is, therefore,
important to realize the contribution of hosts to the variation
between individuals. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst
study to quantify the extent of host effects on the variation
of quantitative traits in N. vitripennis. For most parasitoids,
host quality affects their life-history traits and behaviour
(Godfray 1994). In gregarious species (e.g., N. vitripennis),
the effect of the host on a single offspring depends not only
on host size (reﬂecting the total amount of food), but also on
the number of parasitoids developing within the host (called
“clutch
size”).
In
N.
vitripennis,
sibling
competition
increases with clutch size, and has stronger negative effects
on the body size of females than on males (Sykes et al.
2007). In addition, Nasonia females appear to be able to
sense host quality and adapt their reproductive behaviour
accordingly. They adjust the proportion of male offspring
(sex ratio) according to host condition, laying small eggs
with a large proportion of males into poor hosts (Rivers and
Denlinger 1994; West and Rivero 2000; Wang et al. 2013).
Conversely, traits such as host-, clutch size and sex ratio can
be used as indicators of host quality (West and Rivero
2000). Unfortunately, we did not record host size, sex ratio
or clutch size in this study. In future studies, host effect
could be standardized by these indicators, or these indica-
tors could be systematically varied to assess how they affect
the ecology and evolution of natural populations.

S. Xia et al.
In addition to variance components, we also investigated
relationships within and between wing size and shape traits.
We found strong phenotypic and genetic relationships
between wing-size traits. We also found similar relation-
ships for log-transformed traits. The genetic correlation
estimates found here are comparable with values found in
Drosophila species (Wilkinson et al. 1990; Loeschcke et al.
1999). These high genetic correlations indicate that wing-
size traits share a similar genetic background. Moreover, a
high genetic correlation was found between scaled wing
length and width. This high genetic correlation indicates
that wing length and width have substantial common
genetic variation, even after correcting for body size (as
measured by tibia length). In other words, wing-size traits
are genetically closely related to each other on top of their
dependence on body size. Further genetic studies (e.g.,
GWAS and/or QTL analysis) will be helpful to further
substantiate this observation.
These high genetic correlations between wing-size traits
indicate that these traits will not respond to natural selection
independently. In other words, the response to selection of
one wing-size trait depends on the selection of other wing-
size traits. On the one hand, these correlations can accel-
erate the rate of adaptive evolution if they are in a favour-
able direction. On the other, however, these correlations can
constrain adaptive evolution when the correlated response
in another trait has a ﬁtness cost (e.g., Lande 1979, 1982).
For instance, when natural selection would favour long and
narrow wings because they give greater speed and endur-
ance of ﬂight, the strong positive genetic correlation
between wing length and width constrains response to
selection for long and narrow wings. To quantify such
constraints, we calculated pairwise conditional evolvability
for traits (Hansen et al. 2003; Supplementary Table S4). We
observed considerable reductions in evolvability, especially
between size traits. This suggests that size traits in Nasonia
have limited ability for adaptive response to selection when
natural selection constrains the change in other size traits.
Surprisingly, we observed a weak negative phenotypic
correlation between the aspect ratio and wing length. This is
surprising because it means that individuals with longer
wings have shorter wings when measured relative to their
wing width (remember that aspect ratio is wing length/
width). All eigenvalues of our genetic, host and residual
covariance matrices were non-negative, meaning the esti-
mates are statistically possible, and the negative correlation
does not necessarily imply estimation error. The correlation
between wing length and aspect ratio not only depends on
the (co)variances of wing length and width, but also on the
mean values of those traits (Van Noordwijk and De Jong
1986; Stuart and Ord 1994). Given the values presented in
Tables 2–4, a relative increase in wing length goes together
with an even greater relative increase in wing width,
resulting in a decrease of the aspect ratio. This agrees with
the negative correlation between wing length and aspect
ratio. A genetic study of wing-size differences between N.
vitripennis and N. giraulti also indicated that wing width
increased more than wing length when the overall size of
wings increased in an introgression line created by crossing
N. vitripennis females and N. giraulti males (Weston et al.
1999). However, the phenotypic correlation between the
two traits is very small, and the genetic correlation was not
signiﬁcantly different from zero, implying that selection for
the aspect ratio would have a limited effect on wing length.
To conclude, we found variation for wing size and shape
traits among individuals from an outbred N. vitripennis
population. By applying an adapted version of the “animal
model”, we further demonstrated that wing size and shape
contained signiﬁcant additive genetic variation in the N.
vitripennis HVRx-outbred population. Remarkably and
importantly, we found that hosts rather than genetics
explained most of the phenotypical variation in wing-size
traits. Our ﬁndings also demonstrate the importance of
accounting for host effects to avoid very severe bias in the
estimates of heritability. Our ﬁndings reported here increase
the understanding of heritable variation for wing morphol-
ogy in Nasonia. By combining this knowledge with the
wealth of genetic tools available for Nasonia, it facilitates
the further genetic dissection of wing morphology in N.
vitripennis using tools such as genome-wide association and
genomic prediction.
