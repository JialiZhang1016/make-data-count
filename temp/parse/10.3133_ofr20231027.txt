Atmospheric Deposition of Inorganic Reactive Nitrogen at the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge, 2017–19
monitored ions, including the Nr components NO3
- and NH4
+. From these 
data, total Nr concentrations were calculated, in milligrams per liter (mg/L). 
Precipitation depth was measured by a continuously recording precipitation 
gage (Wetherbee and others, 2021). Measured amounts of annual precipita­
tion were multiplied by the Nr concentrations to calculate total, annual loads 
of Nr—defined as the mass of Nr contamination deposited to the RFNWR 
ecosystem by precipitation.
Sources of Nr in air pollution deposited in precipitation at the CO86 moni­
toring site were evaluated. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin­
istration’s computer model HYSPLIT (Stein and others, 2015) was used to 
determine the paths air masses traveled enroute to the RFNWR for various 
altitudes for 24 hours prior to each precipitation occurrence that contributed 
to samples collected at CO86. The paths, known as back trajectories, point 
back to regions where Nr pollution was entrained into the atmosphere.
What Was Found and Learned?
Annual precipitation depth was slightly below normal in 2017 
(48.8 millimeters [mm]), followed by a drier year in 2018 (42.2 mm), and 
then the wettest of the study period was 2019 (54.5 mm; National Weather 
Service, 2019). Fewer days with rain and snowstorms occurred during 2017 
and 2018 than during 2019 (fig. 2).
Annual measurements (in units of kilograms per hectare) of wet-deposited 
ions are shown in figure 3. These are the amounts of each measured constituent 
deposited onto the RFNWR land and water surfaces as either dissolved or on 
particles smaller than 0.45 microns in the precipitation. Measured Nr deposition 
increased between 2017–19, even though 2018 was not as wet as 2017 (fig. 2).
Urban Deposition Monitoring
Site CO86 is in an urban location by NADP standards because the popu­
lation density is greater than 400 people per square kilometer (km2) within 
15 km of the site (NADP, 2023). As such, the NADP/NTN data for CO86 
wet deposition are excluded from Total Deposition of Atmospheric Nitro­
gen (TDep) maps to prevent broad interpolation of urban measurements 
into nonurban regions of the maps (NADP, 2019). However, this protocol 
causes the maps to underrepresent Nr deposition in urban ecosystems like 
the RFNWR.
The TDep maps are often used to determine critical load exceedances for 
the National Critical Loads Database (CLAD, 2021). A critical load is the 
threshold amount of deposited air contaminants, when exceeded, can cause 
harm to ecosystem resources (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2021). 
Figure 4 shows when data from the CO86 site are inserted into the 2017–19 
TDep maps (CO86 measured wet Nr plus TDep dry N), critical load exceed­
ances are indicated, whereas excluding CO86 data indicates no exceedances 
(U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2021).
Results of back-trajectory modeling of storm directions, shown in figure 5, 
indicate the greatest deposits of Nr predominantly came from storms tracking 
from north and northeast of the RFNWR. This region has many urban, agricul­
tural, and other industrial Nr emission sources (Wetherbee and others, 2019).
Conclusions
Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge has rural characteristics, but its 
unique habitats receive atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition in excess of the 
critical loads for herbaceous plants and shrubs. Back trajectory modeling 
indicates nearby urban and agricultural areas northeast of the refuge as likely 
source regions of nitrogen emissions. This study demonstrates the value of 
including urban monitoring data for wet deposition of inorganic, reactive nitro­
gen in regionally interpolated maps of total atmospheric N deposition for pro­
tection of natural resources.

Abstract
The Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge (RFNWR) in Colorado is home 
to increasingly rare, xeric tallgrass prairie. The RFNWR is also located near 
many combustion and agricultural sources of inorganic reactive nitrogen (Nr), 
which emit Nr to the atmosphere. Wet atmospheric deposition of Nr was moni­
tored at RFNWR during 2017–19 by the U.S. Geological Survey in coopera­
tion with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Comparison of measured Nr 
deposition amounts to critical load values indicated local urban air pollution is 
at a level that could impair the protected RFNWR habitat.
Background
Inorganic reactive nitrogen (Nr) is emitted to the atmosphere as nitrate 
(NO3
-) and ammonium (NH4
+) by many combustion and agricultural sources, 
thus forming air pollution (Galloway and others, 2002). Atmospheric deposi­
tion of air pollution by precipitation (known as wet deposition) back to the 
Earth’s surface can harm ecosystems (Clark and Tilman, 2008). The Nr is 
used by plants as a nutrient, but too much of this nutrient can cause invasive 
species, such as weeds, to grow more rapidly than native grasses and shrubs, 
which can change natural ecosystems (Padgett and Allen, 1999). The Rocky 
Flats National Wildlife Refuge (RFNWR) in Colorado is home to increas­
ingly rare, xeric tallgrass prairie (Nelson, 2010) and it is also located near 
many sources of Nr air pollution. This study shows how the RFNWR eco­
system is affected by atmospheric Nr deposition derived from these sources.
Monitoring Wet Deposition of Inorganic Reactive Nitrogen from 
Air Pollution
Wet deposition (by rain and snow) of atmospheric Nr and other pollutants 
was measured at RFNWR during 2017–19 (study period) at the CO86 moni­
toring site in figure 1. The CO86 site was operated by the U.S. Geological Sur­
vey (USGS) as part of the National Atmospheric Deposition Program/National 
Trends Network (NADP/NTN). The NADP/NTN has served as the Nation’s 
wet-deposition monitoring network since 1978 (NADP, 2023).
Methods
Weekly composite samples of wet-deposited pollutants were collected, 
processed, and analyzed by standard NADP methods (NADP, 2023). Sam­
ples were filtered (0.45 microns) and then analyzed for concentrations of ­­­­
