Abstract 
The role of hybridization in morphological diversification is a fundamental topic in evolutionary biology. However, despite the accumulated 
knowledge on adult hybrid variation, how hybridization affects ontogenetic allometry is less well understood. Here, we investigated the effects 
of hybridization on postnatal ontogenetic allometry in the skulls of a putative hybrid population of introduced Taiwanese macaques (Macaca 
cyclopis) and native Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata). Genomic analyses indicated that the population consisted of individuals with varying 
degrees of admixture, formed by male migration from Japanese to Taiwanese macaques. For overall skull shape, ontogenetic trajectories were 
shifted by hybridization in a nearly additive manner, with moderate transgressive variation observed throughout development. In contrast, for 
the maxillary sinus (hollow space in the face), hybrids grew as fast as Taiwanese macaques, diverging from Japanese macaques, which showed 
slow growth. Consequently, adult hybrids showed a mosaic pattern, that is, the maxillary sinus is as large as that of Taiwanese macaques, while 
the overall skull shape is intermediate. Our findings suggest that the transgressive variation can be caused by prenatal shape modification and 
nonadditive inheritance on regional growth rates, highlighting the complex genetic and ontogenetic bases underlying hybridization-induced 
morphological diversification.

Introduction
A growing understanding indicates that interspecific hybrid-
ization is not rare, even in animals (Mallet, 2005; Taylor & 
Larson, 2019). Furthermore, hybridization is not always mal-
adaptive and can facilitate evolutionary novelty and diversity 
by generating gene combinations not achieved in the parental 
lineages (Arnold & Kunte, 2017; Kagawa & Takimoto, 2018; 
Seehausen, 2004). Thus, hybridization must have played a 
critical role in the evolution of various taxa and has conse-
quently been of significant interest to evolutionary biologists.
Primate hybridization is of particular interest because it 
enhances our understanding of the effects of archaic human 
gene introgression on the modern human lineage. Molecular 
studies show that hybridization is pervasive in primates, 
with relics of ancient hybridization or the existence of a 
natural hybrid zone identified in various taxa of primates, 
for example, macaques, baboons, vervet monkeys, marmo-
sets, colobine monkeys, and howler monkeys (Cortés-Ortiz 
et al., 2015; Malukiewicz et al., 2014; Osada et al., 2021; 
Rogers et al., 2019; Roos et al., 2011; Svardal et al., 2017). 
Furthermore, several studies have assessed the morphological 
effects of hybridization in nonhuman primates (Ackermann 
et al., 2019). In baboons and gorillas, hybrids exhibit anom-
alies such as supplementary rotated teeth or atypical cranial 
sutures at higher frequencies than in their parental lineages 
(Ackermann & Bishop, 2010; Ackermann et al., 2014). In 
various taxa of primates, hybrids often show heterotic/trans-
gressive phenotypes or increased variation in cranial and 
postcranial morphology (Cheverud et al., 1993; Ackermann 
et al., 2014; Fuzessy et al., 2014; Ito et al., 2015; Eichel & 
Ackermann, 2016; Boel et al., 2019; but see Buck et al., 2021). 
Such hybridization-driven genetic perturbations may contrib-
ute to the morphological diversity in primate evolution.
Any morphological evolution is achieved by the modifica-
tion of the ancient ontogenetic trajectory. For example, the 
distinct adult human craniofacial morphology is formed by 
divergence from the hominid common ontogenetic trajectory 
in the early postnatal period (Mitteroecker et al., 2004). The 
difference in brain (endocast) shape between modern humans 
and Neanderthals was also formed by early divergence (Gunz

et al., 2010); however, the overall craniofacial difference 
between the two species was formed by a more or less par-
allel (but not identical) ontogenetic trajectory that originated 
from the established difference at birth (Bastir et al., 2007; 
Ponce de León & Zollikofer, 2001). Because the ontogenetic 
trajectory reflects the expression of genes that control mor-
phology during development, hybridization-induced genomic 
admixture potentially alters an ontogenetic trajectory. Hybrid 
Sulawesi macaques are reported to show acceleration (slope 
increase) and postdisplacement (intercept decrease) in the 
ontogenetic trajectory of several craniofacial traits, although 
this dissociation does not account for adult heterosis 
(Schillaci et al., 2005). Predisplacement (intercept increase) 
occurs in the ontogenetic trajectory of body weight in inter-
subspecies male hybrids of rhesus macaques but is lacking 
in female hybrids (Smith & Scott, 1989; Taylor & Schillaci, 
2008). In nonprimate taxa, several studies have reported dif-
ferent types of ontogenetic modifications, such as pure heter-
ochrony, directional changes, or intermediate but maternally 
biased trajectories, in the head or body shape of fish hybrids 
(Corse et al., 2012; Holtmeier, 2001; Santos-Santos et al., 
2021; Sinama et al., 2013). However, with the exception of 
these studies, knowledge of the effects of interspecific hybrid-
ization on ontogenetic trajectories remains limited, especially 
in mammals.
Anthropogenic hybridization provides an opportunity to 
study the consequences of hybridization, although it is con-
troversial in the context of conservation. In the Oike area 
of Wakayama Prefecture, Japan, introduced Macaca cyclo-
pis (Taiwanese macaques) that escaped from a zoo in the 
1950s hybridized with native M. fuscata (Japanese macaques) 
(Ohsawa et al., 2005). By 2004, the population had grown to 
approximately 300 individuals with four troops (Ohsawa et 
al., 2005). Genetic analyses suggested that the Oike hybrid 
population was formed by male immigration into M. cyclo-
pis from the neighboring native population of M. fuscata 
(Kawamoto et al., 2001, 2008). To prevent genetic introgres-
sion and its impacts on the ecosystems, the government began 
the elimination of introduced and hybrid individuals from the 
Oike area in 2002 and finally declared eradication in 2017, 
with a total of 366 individuals eradicated from the Oike area 
(Shirai et al., 2018). The Oike hybrids show several intrigu-
ing morphological variations. For example, unlike previous 
studies on hybrids of other primate taxa, the Oike hybrids did 
not show a marked increase in dental anomalies or craniofa-
cial variability compared to their parental species (Boel et al., 
2019). Relative tail length variation followed the expectations 
of the additive model (Hamada et al., 2012). Adult cranio-
facial shape followed additivity or was slightly closer than 
expected to that of M. fuscata; in contrast, maxillary sinus 
size (hollow space in the face) was much closer to that of M. 
cyclopis than additivity (Boel et al., 2019; Ito et al., 2015). 
However, it remains unclear how these adult differences man-
ifested during development.
This study aimed to elucidate the effects of hybridization 
on the ontogenetic trajectory of craniofacial morphology 
using samples from the Oike hybrid population. First, we 
estimated the population structure of the Oike population as 
well as the hybrid index and class (generation) of individu-
als based on genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs). Second, we compared morphological variation and 
ontogenetic trajectories of the cranium, mandible, and max-
illary sinus with the hybrid index and among hybrid classes. 
Comparing ontogenetic trajectories among hybrids and 
parental lines will improve our understanding of the genetic 
and ontogenetic basis of hybridization-induced morphologi-
cal diversification.
Materials and methods
Samples
Almost all available samples from the Oike hybrid popula-
tion were screened, including 245 skeletal specimens and 287 
DNA samples (Supplementary Table S1; Figure 1). Note that 
some samples were filtered out prior to the main analyses 
(see below for details). Of these, the 215 skeletal specimens 
could be linked to DNA samples, where we linked them as 
far as the IDs on the records could be uniquely identified, 
even if they did not show an exact match. These samples 
came from collections obtained under the government erad-
ication program between 2003 and 2006; no animals were 
sacrificed for research purposes. Skeletal specimens are stored 
at the Primate Research Institute (now the Center for the 
Evolutionary Origins of Human Behavior), Kyoto University 
(Inuyama, Japan). Note that individuals judged to be pure 
Japanese macaques in the Oike area had been released 
(Hamada et al., 2008).
In addition, to test whether pure parental individuals 
remained in the Oike population, we examined DNA from 
pure captive M. cyclopis (N = 4) and M. fuscata (N = 4) 
housed at the Primate Research Institute. The M. fuscata 
individuals were descendants of individuals transferred from 
Arashiyama, Kyoto, approximately 100 km north-northeast 
of the Oike area. There is no record of the exact origin of 
the M. cyclopis individuals. Sample collection from these 
captive individuals was performed according to the recom-
mendations of the Guidelines for Care and Use of Nonhuman 
Primates Version 2 and 3 of the Primate Research Institute, 
Kyoto University (2002, 2010). DNA was extracted from 
blood using the phenol-chloroform method.
Skeletal specimens of M. cyclopis (N = 54) and M. fuscata 
(N = 88) stored at the Primate Research Institute and the 
Japan Monkey Centre (Inuyama, Japan) were measured as 
surrogates for parental individuals for morphological anal-
yses (because the actual parental populations are unknown). 
Captive specimens and specimens of unknown origin were 
initially included, but preliminary analyses revealed morpho-
logical differences between wild and captive specimens (see 
below). Therefore, only wild specimens (N = 18 for M. cyclo-
pis, N = 86 for M. fuscata) were used for the main analyses. 
Wild M. cyclopis specimens were obtained from the intro-
duced population on Izu-Oshima Island, Tokyo, Japan, where 
M. fuscata is not distributed. Wild M. fuscata specimens were 
obtained from localities around the Oike area and are there-
fore likely to be genetically close to a parental population (Ito 
et al., 2021; Suzuki-Hashido et al., 2015).
Genetic analyses
Double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing was 
performed based on Peterson’s protocol (Peterson et al., 2012) 
with modifications (Sakaguchi et al., 2015, 2017). After filtering 
raw reads for overall sequence quality, genotypes were called 
using STACKS 2.59 (Rochette & Catchen, 2017). Because 
STACKS provides diploid genotypes, genotypes on male sex 
chromosomes were converted to haploid using diploid2hap-
loid.py 
(https://github.com/itots/diploid2haploid.git),

omitting heterogeneous genotypes (1.2% for the X chromo-
some and 0.8% for the Y chromosome). After filtering, we 
obtained 6,461 variant sites in 289 individuals for the auto-
some (total genotyping rate = 0.96), 171 sites in 289 indi-
viduals for the X chromosome (0.96), and 12 sites in 152 
individuals for the Y chromosome (0.95). See Supplementary 
note for details.
Global ancestry was inferred from the SNPs separately 
for autosomes and X chromosomes using ADMIXTURE 
(Alexander & Novembre, 2009); the male X chromosome 
was treated as haploid using the --haploid flag. Principal 
component analysis (PCA) was performed using the “ade-
genet” package (Jombart, 2008) in R (R Developmental Core 
Team, 2021). For the Y chromosome, K-means cluster anal-
ysis (K = 2) was performed based on the first principal com-
ponent (PC). Six samples showed inconsistencies in global 
ancestry or sex identification with data from Kawamoto et al. 
(2008) and were removed from the subsequent analyses. See 
Supplementary note for details.
Individuals in the Oike population were classified into 23 
M. cyclopis (Q < 0.001), 11 M. fuscata (Q > 0.999), and 242 
putatively admixed individuals (0.001 ≤ Q ≤ 0.999) based 
on the ADMIXTURE Q score (K = 2) of autosomal SNPs. 
Diagnostic markers were detected as differentially fixed sites 
(allele frequency difference between the two parental pop-
ulations [δ] = 1), omitting loci with missing genotype rates 
within each of the two parental populations >0.1. Hybrid 
index, the proportion of ancestry belonging to M. fuscata, and 
interspecific heterozygosity, the proportion of loci with alleles 
from both parental populations, were calculated from the 196 
autosomal diagnostic markers using a custom R script.
Hybrid classes were estimated for individuals in the Oike 
population using NewHybrids 1.1 (Anderson & Thompson, 
2002). This Bayesian-based method calculates the posterior 
probability that an individual belongs to a genotype fre-
quency class. The SNP dataset of 196 autosomal diagnos-
tic markers was converted into a NewHybrid format using 
PGDSpider 2.1.1.5 (Lischer & Excoffier, 2012). The “z” 
option was used to instruct NewHybrid that individuals with 
a hybrid index = 0 or 1 were pure parental individuals. Ten 
replicates were run with randomly differentiated seeds using 
the “parallelnewhybrid” R package (Wringe et al., 2017), 
with minor modifications (https://github.com/itots/parallel-
newhybrid.git). Each run started with Jeffery’s prior and six 
default genotype frequency classes and consisted of 10,000 
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sweeps after 10,000 
burn-in iterations. We confirmed MCMC convergence by 
visual inspection. Based on the mean posterior probabili-
ties, each individual was assigned to one of six genealogical 
classes: M. cyclopis (P0), M. fuscata (P1), F1, F2 hybrids, and 
backcrosses of M. cyclopis (BC0) and M. fuscata (BC1). We 
discarded assignments with mean posterior probability <0.99, 
P0 with hybrid index > 0, P1 with hybrid index < 1, and F1 
with interspecific heterozygosity <0.95; these were removed 
from analyses examining hybrid class differences (shown as 
NA in figures). Note that individuals identified as F2, BC0, 
and BC1 may include later generations; unfortunately, it is 
difficult to distinguish between hybrid classes of recombi-
nant generations based on unphased and limited numbers of 
variants.
Morphological analyses
The 10-step developmental phase was determined based on 
the dental eruption pattern and spheno-occipital synchon-
drosis, according to Mouri (1994), with minor modifications 
(Supplementary Table S2). Based on this, developmental

stages were determined as infant (developmental phase < 3), 
juvenile (<8), and adult (≥8). These stages were used to evalu-
ate age structure and developmental changes in morphology.
The cranium and mandible were scanned by computed tomog-
raphy, and 3D landmarks were digitized (cranium: number of 
landmarks = 50, mandible: 28, and maxillary sinus: 10) using 3D 
Slicer (https://www.slicer.org/) (Kikinis et al., 2014; Supplementary 
Table S3; Figure 2). See Supplementary note for details. All land-
marks on the maxillary sinus were type III and were used only 
to evaluate size, not shape. Digitization was performed twice on 
all specimens by a single observer to evaluate and minimize mea-
surement errors. Specimens with a missing landmark ratio >0.2 
(three specimens for the cranium and one for the mandible) were 
removed. For the remaining specimens, missing landmarks (1–10 
in 53 specimens for the cranium, 1–4 in 10 specimens for the 
mandible, and 1–2 in 30 specimens for the maxillary sinus) were 
imputed based on the Bayesian PCA method using the “LOST” R 
package (Arbour & Brown, 2014, 2020).
Generalized Procrustes analysis and Procrustes analysis of 
variance were performed to assess measurement error using 
the “geomorph” R package (Adams et al., 2021; Baken et al., 
2021; Collyer & Adams, 2018, 2021). Here, centroid size 
was calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared 
distances of a set of landmarks from their centroid. For the 
cranium and mandible, shape measurement errors were neg-
ligible compared to interindividual variation (Supplementary 
Table S4), and a symmetric component was used in the fol-
lowing analyses. Measurement errors were negligible for the 
centroid size of the cranium, mandible, and maxillary sinus 
(Supplementary Table S5), and the mean of replicates (mean 
of replicates and sides for maxillary sinus) was used in the 
following analyses.

Only wild specimens were analyzed, as significant mor-
phological differences were found between captive and wild 
specimens (Supplementary Tables S6 and S7). Samples with 
missing values for sex (N = 1–2), hybrid index (N = 28), and 
hybrid class (N = 40–41) were excluded from subsequent 
analyses and figures requiring these variables. When compar-
ing hybrid classes, the Oike individuals identified as P0 and 
the wild M. cyclopis from Izu-Oshima Island were treated 
together as one group (denoted as cyclopis_P0).
To evaluate the effect of hybridization on growth trajecto-
ries, the natural logarithm of centroid size (lnCS) was evalu-
ated in relation to the developmental phase for each hybrid 
class. To summarize the shape variation of the cranium and 
mandible, PCA was performed on the shape components with 
all samples pooled using the “geomorph” R package, but each 
sex was shown separately in the scatterplots for better visu-
alization. Differences in lnCS and PCs between hybrid classes 
at each stage were evaluated by analysis of variance with sex 
as a covariate using the “car” R package (Fox & Weisberg, 
2019), and their effect sizes were evaluated using the “rstatix” 
R package (Kassambara, 2023).
Ontogenetic shape allometry was evaluated by multivari-
ate regression using the R package “geomorph.” The response 
variable was the shape component, and the explanatory vari-
ables were lnCS, hybrid class, and their interaction. Pairwise 
vector correlations were evaluated using the R package 
“RRPP” (Collyer & Adams, 2018, 2021). Phenotypic tra-
jectory analysis was also performed to evaluate trajectory 
magnitude, direction, and shape differences between hybrid 
classes using the “geomorph” R package. Developmental 
stage, hybrid class, and their interaction were used as explan-
atory variables; hybrid classes with few samples in any of the 
three developmental stages (P0_cyclopis and F1 for females; 
F1 and F2 for males) were omitted. Disparities at each devel-
opmental stage were evaluated as a measure of Procrustes 
variance between the means of each hybrid class using the 
“geomorph” R package. For the maxillary sinus, reduced 
major axis regression was performed to assess the relation-
ship between sinus lnCS and cranial lnCS, and slope and ele-
vation differences between hybrid classes were tested using 
the “smatr” R package (Warton et al., 2012).
Adult variation was evaluated in relation to the hybrid 
index. To detect shape differences between pure M. cyclopis 
and M. fuscata, a between-group PCA (bgPCA) was per-
formed, and admixed individuals were projected onto the 
bgPC1 axis using the “Morpho” R package (Schlager, 2017). 
The lnCS, bgPC1, and relative sinus size (sinus lnCS - cra-
nium lnCS) were regressed against the hybrid index for the 
admixed individuals, and deviations in elevation and slope 
from additivity (the line through the means of each parent) 
were tested using the “smatr” R package.
Deviations from additivity in multivariate space were evalu-
ated as two orthogonal components, mismatch (M) and bias (B):
M = dhsinθ
dp
,
B = dhcosθ
dp
,
where θ is the angle between the vector passing through the 
mean of pure M. cyclopis and that of a hybrid class and the 
vector passing through the mean of pure M. cyclopis and that 
of M. fuscata; dh and dp are the magnitudes of the two vectors, 
respectively. For cranial and mandibular shapes, distances 
were calculated as Procrustes distances using the R pack-
age “shapes” (Dryden, 2021). For relative maxillary sinus 
size, only B was calculated because it is univariate. M and 
B are similar to the transgression and closeness presented by 
Renaud et al. (2012), respectively, but differ in their orthog-
onality and are identical to the indices presented by Mérot et 
al. (2020) and Thompson et al. (2021), except for standard-
ization. M > 0 indicates orthogonal deviations from the inter-
parental axis, standardized by the interspecific distance. This 
is caused by different traits having dominance in conflicting 
directions in multivariate space (Thompson et al., 2021). Any 
deviations of B from the hybrid index indicate biases from 
additivity along the interparental axis, and in particular, B < 0 
and B > 1 indicate exceeding the parental means, that is, over-
dominance. M and B were calculated using a custom R script.
Each sex was analyzed separately in these analyses unless 
otherwise noted.
Results
Population structure
PCA and ADMIXTURE showed that the Oike population con-
sisted of individuals with varying degrees of admixture, proba-
bly including pure M. cyclopis and M. fuscata (Supplementary 
Figures S1 and S2). The M. cyclopis individuals housed at the 
Primate Research Institute appeared to have a small amount 
of M. fuscata-derived ancestry (Supplementary Figure S2), 
but this did not affect subsequent analyses that included only 
samples from the Oike population. The NewHybrids analy-
sis showed that the Oike population consists of the six pre-
defined hybrid classes (P0, P1, F1, F2, BC0, and BC1; Figure 
3). It should be noted, however, that some of the individuals 
identified as F2, BC0, and BC1 may be from later generations. 
In the Oike population, the mean admixture proportion of 
M. fuscata-derived ancestry was 0.45 for autosomal, 0.46 for 
X-chromosomal in both sexes, and 0.50 for Y-chromosomal 
DNA. Note that the mean admixture proportion for auto-
somes was slightly biased toward M. cyclopis in BC0 and 
F2 than expected by random mating starting from the same 
number of parental lines (Supplementary Table S8). The M. 
fuscata-type mtDNA ancestry was only observed in P0, that 
is, pure M. fuscata. The P0 individuals were all males, while 
males were significantly less frequent than females in the F1 
(χ2 = 5.76, Df = 1, P = 0.016) (Supplementary Table 
S9; Figure 3). In the other hybrid classes, the sex ratio was 
not significantly skewed. The age structure was biased toward 
adults in F1 but toward earlier stages in F2 (Supplementary 
Table S10; Figure 3).
Ontogenetic allometry
Throughout development, cranial and mandibular lnCS 
were larger in M. fuscata than in M. cyclopis, with hybrids 
in between in an almost additive manner (Supplementary 
Table S11; Supplementary Figure S3). Among the first three 
PCs explaining > 80% of the total variance, PC1 represented 
the ontogenetic allometric changes (Figure 4; Supplementary 
Figure S4), showing that larger (more developed) individuals 
had more elongated faces, relatively smaller neurocraniums, 
and narrower and longer mandibles. A similar shape change 
was observed in the multivariate regression analysis (see 
below). In contrast, PC2 represented interspecific differences 
throughout development (Supplementary Table S11; Figure 4;

Supplementary Figures S4 and S5). M. fuscata showed a rela-
tively longer face with an inferiorly inclined anterior maxilla 
and a mandible with a deeper ramus and shorter corpus than 
those of M. cyclopis; the hybrids were positioned in between 
in an almost additive manner. The PC plots indicated that 
the ontogenetic trajectories were not strictly linear, showing 
curves that detour in juveniles and return to an infantile shape 
(in the PC2 axis) in adults.
Multivariate regression indicated that heterogeneity in 
allometric slopes was small to moderate but marginally sig-
nificant in the female mandible and male cranium (Tables 
1 and 2; Figure 5; Supplementary Figure S6). Allometric 
angles between the parental species ranged from 9.7 to 
17.9 (degrees), although they were not significant after the 
Bonferroni adjustment. These values were comparable to 
those between a parental species and each of BC0, F2, and BC1 
(8.3–18.7), although F1, which has few infant and juvenile 
specimens, often showed much larger angle differences (16.2–
38.8). From infant to adult, the disparity decreased slightly 
in females and increased slightly in males (Supplementary 
Figure S7). The mismatch was already present in infants and/
or juveniles to the extent of half the interspecific distance or 
less and remained constant or increased slightly until adult-
hood (Supplementary Figure S7). Allometric elevations were 
significantly different among hybrid classes, where hybrids 
were positioned between the parental species. Male allome-
tric elevations were slightly biased toward M. fuscata than 
expected in the additive model, although the mean admix-
ture proportion of autosomes was rather biased toward M. 
cyclopis in BC0 and F2 (Supplementary Table S8). Phenotypic 
trajectory analysis supported the finding that ontogenetic tra-
jectories were nonlinear and did not differ greatly in magni-
tude, direction, and shape among hybrid classes, although in 
some cases, they were marginally significant (Supplementary 
Table S12; Figure 6).
The allometric slope of the maxillary sinus size differed 
significantly among the hybrid classes (Supplementary Table 
S13; Figure 7). There were small but significant differences 
in the absolute and relative sizes of the maxillary sinus, even 
at early developmental phases (Supplementary Table S11; 
Supplementary Figure S3). M. fuscata had a milder allometric 
slope than the other hybrid classes, including M. cyclops, and 
the difference between M. fuscata and the others therefore 
increased at later developmental phases.
Adult morphology
Admixed adults in the Oike populations followed the expecta-
tions of the additive model or were sometimes slightly biased 
toward M. fuscata in the size and shape component repre-
senting interspecific differences (bgPC1) (Table 3; Figure 8).

Differences in the major allometric components (PC1 and 
regression score) among hybrid classes were relatively 
small, although significant for cranial PC1 at developmen-
tal phase 10 (Supplementary Table S11; Figures 4 and 5; 
Supplementary Figure S6). In contrast, the maxillary sinuses 
of hybrids were as large as those of M. cyclopis, regardless 
of hybrid index, and deviated significantly from additivity 
(Table 3; Figure 8). Marked transgressive segregations were 
observed in cranial and mandibular shapes (Table 4), partic-
ularly in the nonallometric shape space represented by PC2 
and PC3 (Supplementary Figure S5). For cranial and mandib-
ular shapes, deviations from additivity were relatively small in 
the bias component, while the degree of mismatch was com-
parable to half the interspecific distance. Some hybrids were 
also transgressive in the morpho-space of cranial shape that 
represents interspecific difference (PC2) and the relative size 
of the maxillary sinus (Supplementary Figure S8).
Discussion
Population structure
This study examined 281 samples (after filtering) captured in 
the Oike area between 2003 and 2006. Considering that the 
estimated population size in the early 2000s was about 200–
300 (Ohsawa et al., 2005) and the total number of captured 
individuals was 366, the samples used in this study were suf-
ficient to evaluate the population structure of the Oike area.
Our results suggested that the Oike population consisted of 
pure M. cyclopis, pure M. fuscata (males only), the first and 
subsequent generations of hybrids, and the backcross hybrids

of both parental species. The first generation consisted mainly 
of adults, while a few adults  were observed in the subse-
quent generations. This implies that successful interbreeding 
between pure M. cyclopis and M. fuscata was probably spo-
radic and rare, at least in the years before eradication. In con-
trast, backcrossing and interhybrid breeding were probably 
widespread. As indicated in previous studies (Kawamoto et 
al., 2001, 2008), no M. fuscata-type mtDNA was observed in 
the admixed individuals, suggesting that only male M. fuscata 
individuals migrated into the Oike population. Considering 
the philopatric nature of female macaques, this is a reasonable 
scenario. Given male migration and assuming random breed-
ing, the proportion of Y chromosome ancestry was expected 
to be twice that of autosomes, but this was much lower than 
expected. Therefore, a mechanism preventing random breed-
ing, such as Haldane’s rule, population subdivision, or assor-
tative mating, may have existed in this population. Fewer 
males than females in the F1 generation implies lower male 
survival or male emigration, although this is inconclusive due 
to the small sample size. The population subdivision scenario 
is also plausible, as four troops were observed in the Oike 
area (Ohsawa et al., 2005); heterogeneity in migration rate 
from neighboring M. fuscata between troops may underlie the 
relatively low frequency of M. fuscata-type Y chromosomes 
in the Oike population.
Effects of hybridization on ontogenetic trajectories
In multivariate shape space, the ontogenetic trajectories of the 
cranium and mandible differed between the parental species. 
Direction differed (although not significantly) by less than 
20° between the parental species, which is comparable to 
that found between species within a papionin genus (Simons 
& Frost, 2021; Singleton, 2012). Hybridization shifted 
ontogenetic trajectories by the proportion of ancestry, 
although in some cases, with a slight bias toward M. fuscata. 
Hybridization also changed the direction to the same extent 
as the angle between the parental species (in most cases, they 
were not significant). However, the disparity and the degree 
of transgression did not greatly increase or decrease during 
development. In other words, the hybridization-induced 
shape differentiations were already manifested at birth; the 
differences in magnitude are maintained during postnatal 
ontogeny. This finding is partially consistent with a study of 
Sulawesi macaques, which showed no significant differenti-
ation in the ontogenetic trajectory of the cranium between 
hybrids and their parental species in multivariate allometric 
space (Schillaci et al., 2005). Schillaci et al. (2005) reported 
hybridization-induced heterochrony in several cranial traits 
in bivariate allometric trajectories; this is pure heterochrony 
(sensu Mitteroecker et al., 2004), which cannot be evaluated 
when trajectories do not overlap in multivariate space. Thus, 
although hybridization shifts the ontogenetic trajectory and 
may even change the direction, these postnatal ontogenetic 
changes did not contribute to the increase in disparity and 
transgressive variation in adults. As suggested by Zelditch 
et al. (2016), the discrepancy may be ascribed to postnatally 
generated variation counteracting earlier generated variation.
It should be noted that the present finding of a limited 
contribution of hybridization-induced ontogenetic trajectory 
change to the increase in adult shape variation may be lim-
ited to the case of parental pairs with relatively small onto-
genetic trajectory differences. Parallel ontogenetic trajectory

Ito et al.
differentiation between species has been widely observed 
in primate skull shape (Mouri, 1996; Ponce de León & 
Zollikofer, 2001; Toyoda et al., 2022), while recent multi-
variate studies have shown that the direction of ontogenetic 
trajectories of cranial shape differs between species to varying 
degrees across primate taxa (Mitteroecker et al., 2004; Simons 
& Frost, 2021; Singleton, 2012; Vioarsdóttir & Cobb, 2004). 
The impacts of hybridization between species with greater 
differences in ontogenetic trajectories are of interest to future 
studies.
The finding that transgressive segregation is observed in 
hybrids is consistent with many previous studies examining 
hybrid phenotypic variation in various taxa of organisms 
(Ackermann et al., 2019; Albertson & Kocher, 2005; Renaud 
et al., 2012; Rieseberg et al., 1999; Stelkens et al., 2009). 
What our finding can add to the literature is that transgres-
sive segregation is likely to manifest prenatally without much 
change postnatally, at least in magnitude. Transgressive segre-
gation is often found in a trait composed of multiple modules, 
such as the cranium and mandible examined in our study, 
and is probably caused by different modules responding to 
hybridization in opposite directions (Albertson & Kocher, 
2005; Renaud et al., 2012). Whether and how transgressive 
segregation manifests largely depends on the pattern and 
strength of integration among modules. Macaques appear 
to have achieved relaxed integration among modules in the 
cranium and mandible, respectively, to a degree sufficient to 
manifest transgressive segmentation.
The maxillary sinus of M. cyclopis is already larger than 
that of M. fuscata at birth, and the postnatal growth rate of 
M. cyclopis is much faster than that of M. fuscata. 
Hybridization altered the size of the maxillary sinus at 
birth by the proportion of ancestry, whereas the growth 
rate of hybrids was as fast as that of M. cyclopis, regard-
less of the proportion of ancestry. Although the genetic 
mechanisms underlying the nonadditive inheritance of the 
postnatal growth rate of the maxillary sinus are unknown, 
two hypotheses can be proposed. First, M. fuscata-type 
cytoplasmic (e.g., mitochondrial) genes may inhibit sinus 
growth. Since cytoplasmic genes were not introduced into 
the hybrids due to male-biased migration, all hybrids exhib-
ited a growth rate as fast as that of M. cyclopis. Maternal 
inheritance associated with nuclear genes, such as genomic 
imprinting, would not account for the deviations in the 
second and subsequent generations of hybrids. Second, an 
epistatic interaction of M. fuscata-type alleles may inhibit 
sinus growth. Such an interaction can be disrupted by the 
introgression of alleles from another species, even if only 
a small fraction. Considering that backcrossed individuals 
did not recover the slow sinus growth rate typical of M. 
fuscata, an epistatic interaction, if any, was controlled by 
not a few genes. In either case, as a consequence, the adult

hybrids show a mosaic pattern, that is, the maxillary sinus 
is as large as that of M. cyclopis, although the cranium 
shape is almost intermediate (in the shape component rep-
resenting interspecific difference) between the two parental 
species.
Evolutionary background underlying the 
consequences of hybridization
How hybridization affects ontogenetic trajectories is likely 
to depend on the evolutionary processes that produced the 
difference in genetic architecture between the parental lin-
eages. This idea stems from the finding that genetic architec-
ture imposes limits on transgressive segregation (Albertson & 
Kocher, 2005). The whole body shape of fish shows much 
greater differences in ontogenetic direction between the 
parental lineages and between them and their hybrids (Santos-
Santos et al., 2021; Sinama et al., 2013) than those observed 
in the cranium and mandible of hybrid macaques. It can be 
hypothesized that the fish body is less integrated between 
modules and has experienced selective pressures that act dif-
ferently on each module, producing greater changes in onto-
genetic direction. In contrast, the evolutionary forces shaping 
interspecific differences in macaque skulls may not have been 
strong enough to greatly affect ontogenetic directions.
The genetic distance between the parental lines is a sig-
nificant predictor of the expression of transgressive segrega-
tion in hybrids (Stelkens & Seehausen, 2009; Stelkens et al., 
2009). The evolutionary history of the group consisting of M. 
cyclopis, M. fuscata, and M. mulatta has been relatively well 
studied. Among the three, M. fuscata diverged first, followed

by M. cyclopis, and then the Chinese and Indian lineages 
of M. mulatta diverged, with gene flow between some pairs 
of their ancestors (Osada et al., 2021). Although the time of 
divergence between M. cyclopis and M. fuscata remains con-
troversial, the two species were probably isolated no later 
than 0.43 million years ago, the last time the Japanese archi-
pelago was connected to the continent (Aimi, 2002). It should 
be noted that the substitution rate of the M. fuscata lineage 
is much higher than the other lineages, probably due to the 
ancestral population bottleneck and the resulting accumula-
tion of slightly deleterious mutations (Ito et al., 2021). M. 
fuscata is also peculiar in that it has the northernmost distri-
bution among nonhuman primates, and some of its morpho-
logical features probably reflect adaptation to high-latitude 
environments (Antón, 1996). Such relatively deep divergence 
and specialization in the parental lineages probably formed 
the genetic architecture that produced transgressive pheno-
types in hybrids. This is in contrast to the case of pelvic mor-
phology of hybrids between Chinese and Indian lineages of 
M. mulatta, which shows weak interlineage differences and 
no evidence of transgressive phenotypes (Buck et al., 2021). 
The divergence between Chinese and Indian lineages of M. 
mulatta is shallower than that between M. cyclopis and M. 
mulatta, but not as different. The demographic history and 
adaptive evolution, not just the depth of divergence, of the 
parental lineages is likely to be the key to what variation is 
manifested in hybrids.
The maxillary sinus is peculiar in that the growth rate 
appears to show cytoplasmic or epistatic inheritance. If epi-
static interaction inhibits sinus growth in M. fuscata, it is 
reasonable to assume that the genetic architecture has been 
formed by natural selection, that is, a coadapted gene com-
plex. The small maxillary sinus may be advantageous in the 
high-latitude environment inhabited by M. fuscata because 
it could provide space for the expansion of the nasal cavity 
or to support a strong bite. In fact, M. fuscata populations 
at higher latitudes have a larger nasal cavity and a smaller 
maxillary sinus (Rae et al., 2003), and M. fuscata shows a 
cranial adaptation to a high attrition diet compared to its 
relatives (Antón, 1996). Alternatively, the growth rate of the 
maxillary sinus may be controlled by a genetic factor that 
pleiotropically affects an unknown functional trait, as it is 
questionable whether the maxillary sinus has a functional 
role (Márquez, 2008; Rae & Koppe, 2004) or is related to 
biomechanical force (Rae & Koppe, 2008). In either case, 
a somewhat independent trait that is under different selec-
tive pressure from the surrounding structure, such as the 
maxillary sinus, may lead to specific ontogenetic trajectory 
differentiation in hybrids, whereas highly integrated traits 
may not.

Conclusions
This study showed that: (a) Hybridization shifted the ontoge-
netic trajectories of cranial and mandibular shapes in a nearly 
additive manner. (b) Transgressive variation in cranial and 
mandibular shape manifested at birth; hybridization-induced 
changes in postnatal ontogenetic direction did not contribute 
to increases in adult transgressive variation or disparity. (c) 
Hybridization disrupted a M. fuscata-specific genetic func-
tion that inhibited maxillary sinus growth, producing hybrids 
with a mosaic pattern, that is, the maxillary sinus was as 
large as that of M. cyclopis, although the cranial shape was 
intermediate in the shape component representing interspe-
cific difference. This study has several limitations. First, the 
skeletal specimens used as surrogates for the parental popula-
tions may differ in morphology from the actual parental pop-
ulations due to regional intraspecific variation, although the 
surrogates were selected from localities as close as possible to 
the locality of the hybrid population. Second, the ontogenetic

trajectories lack stability due to the small sample size, and the 
present findings should be validated based on a larger sample 
size. Third, the F2, BC0, and BC1 categorized in this study 
may include later generations, and such genetic heterogene-
ity of group members may obscure patterns of variation; this 
concern could be addressed by inferring generations in detail 
based on fine-scale phased data or using the samples with 
known genealogy. Despite these limitations, this study high-
lights the complex genetic and ontogenetic bases underlying 
hybridization-induced differentiation in ontogenetic trajecto-
ries and resulting morphological diversification.
