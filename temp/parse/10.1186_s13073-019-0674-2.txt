Abstract
Background: Sepsis, a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated systemic immune response to
infection, associates with reduced responsiveness to subsequent infections. How such tolerance is acquired is not
well understood but is known to involve epigenetic and transcriptional dysregulation.
Methods: Bead arrays were used to compare global DNA methylation changes in patients with sepsis, non-
infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and healthy controls. Bioinformatic analyses were performed
to dissect functional reprogramming and signaling pathways related to the acquisition of these specific DNA
methylation alterations. Finally, in vitro experiments using human monocytes were performed to test the induction
of similar DNA methylation reprogramming.
Results: Here, we focused on DNA methylation changes associated with sepsis, given their potential role in
stabilizing altered phenotypes. Tolerized monocytes from patients with sepsis display changes in their DNA
methylomes with respect to those from healthy controls, affecting critical monocyte-related genes. DNA
methylation profiles correlate with IL-10 and IL-6 levels, significantly increased in monocytes in sepsis, as well as
with the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score; the observed changes associate with TFs and pathways
downstream to toll-like receptors and inflammatory cytokines. In fact, in vitro stimulation of toll-like receptors in
monocytes results in similar gains and losses of methylation together with the acquisition of tolerance.
Conclusion: We have identified a DNA methylation signature associated with sepsis that is downstream to the
response of monocytes to inflammatory signals associated with the acquisition of a tolerized phenotype and
organic dysfunction.

Background
Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by
a dysregulated host response to infection [1]. Sepsis can
induce acute kidney injury and multiple organ failures
and represents the most common cause of death in
intensive care units [2, 3]. The immune response during
sepsis is complex and varies over time, with the con-
comitant occurrence of both pro-inflammatory and anti-
inflammatory mechanisms [3]. Despite intense study, the
cellular and molecular basis of human sepsis remains
still unclear and effective therapies are lacking.
In many cases, sepsis survivors continue to succumb
to secondary challenges, latent infections, or malignan-
cies several years after the initial septic episode [4]. It
has been recognized that sepsis leads to the acquisition
of tolerance, a state of reduced responsiveness to

subsequent stimulation after a primary bacterial insult
that results in reduced cytokine production by mono-
cytes and macrophages [5]. As a result, most patients
with sepsis rapidly display signs of profound immuno-
suppression, associated with an increase in hypoxia in-
ducible
factor-1α
expression
that
drives
functional
reprogramming [6]. Such immune reprogramming is in
part due to disruption of homeostasis and defective cel-
lular energy metabolism which underlies the inability to
respond to secondary or further stimulation [7]. A num-
ber of mechanisms are involved in the homeostasis of
the immune system, where monocytes are pivotal. These
cells recognize pathogen patterns or intercept and
phagocytose antigens, critical steps in eliminating bacter-
ial infections, halting the increase in viral load, and
eradicating certain neoplastic growths. Several monocyte
subtypes are also crucial to the de-escalation of inflam-
mation and in wound healing [8]. In vitro experiments
mimicking septic conditions have shown that upon
endotoxin re-challenge with Gram-negative bacteria or
only lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the major component of
the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, tolerized
monocytes/macrophages show a drastic downregulation
of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor
[TNF] α, interleukin [IL]-6, IL-1β, IL-12) in parallel with
the upregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-
10, transforming growth factor (TGF) β, and IL-1RA as
compared to non-tolerized cells challenged with the
same stimuli. These tolerant monocytes/macrophages
also show an impaired antigen presenting capacity corre-
lated with decreased expression of human leukocyte
antigen (HLA)-DR and some costimulatory molecules
[9] and upregulation of the immune checkpoint ligand
PD-L1 [10].
The acquisition of endotoxin tolerance is accompanied
by a remodeling of the epigenomic profiles [11–13].
Most studies have focused on histone modification
changes. Following LPS stimulation of macrophages,
toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced genes are categorized
into two classes: tolerized and non-tolerized genes. Tol-
erized genes, which include inflammatory genes, show
repressed expression whereas non-tolerized genes in-
crease their levels. Transcriptional activation of non-
tolerized genes is associated with high levels of histone
acetylation and H3K4me3 at their promoters [11]. In
addition, monocytes exposed to LPS showed changes in
H3K27ac, H3K4me1, and H3K4me3 [12]. It has also
been shown that during endotoxin tolerance, leukocytes
display increased levels of repressive H3K9me2 mark at
the promoter regions of the IL1B and TNF genes [14,
15]. Specifically, the H3K9 histone methyltransferase,
G9a, is essential for silencing the TNFA gene [16].
In this context, DNA methylation changes have re-
ceived less attention than histone modifications for
several reasons. It has been mainly because DNA methy-
lation has a more limited range of effects than histone
modifications
[17].
Nevertheless,
DNA
methylation
changes are generally highly relevant for the biology of
myeloid cells [18]. On the one hand, various studies have
demonstrated the relevance of DNA (cytosine-5)-meth-
yltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) and ten-eleven transloca-
tion
methylcytosine
dioxygenase
2
(TET2),
both
enzymes respectively essential for the de novo incorpor-
ation and oxidation/removal of methyl groups to cyto-
sines, to the function of monocytes, dendritic cells, and
macrophages [19, 20]. On the other hand, DNA methy-
lation is generally associated with the stabilization of a
transcriptional and functional state; thus, it is appealing
to hypothesize that sepsis results in prolonged acquisi-
tion of DNA methylation changes of the monocytes well
beyond the acute phase of sepsis, and perhaps contribut-
ing to stabilize the state of tolerance of monocytes. Most
importantly, TET2 has a role in resolution of inflamma-
tion by recruiting HDAC2 to repress inflammatory genes
[21] and to promote sepsis-induced emergency myelo-
poiesis [22].
In
this
study,
we
investigated
DNA
methylation
changes in monocytes from individuals who have experi-
enced an episode of sepsis. We performed DNA methy-
lation profiling where we compared sorted monocytes
from patients with sepsis and healthy controls. The ana-
lysis revealed the existence of significant DNA methyla-
tion differences between the two groups in CpG sites
mapping at genes relevant for monocyte-related immune
responses. Most importantly, we identified a significant
relationship between DNA methylation data and IL-10
and IL-6 cytokine levels, which are significantly in-
creased in patients with sepsis, as well as with organ dys-
function. We have determined that changes in DNA
methylation are determined by TLR stimulation and the
altered levels of inflammatory cytokines. Our findings
also highlight the implication of TLR stimulation and cy-
tokines under sepsis in establishing and perpetuating the
dysregulated epigenetic signature and phenotype of
monocytes.
Methods
Human samples
We selected and diagnosed patients with sepsis based on
the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis
and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) [1]. For each patient, we cal-
culated the Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure As-
sessment (SOFA) score. The study included 14 patients
with bacterial infections with SOFA ranging from 2 to 8.
Patients were obtained from La Paz University Hospital
and Vall d’Hebron University Hospital. Blood samples
were collected at the first 12 h of sepsis diagnosis, which
was confirmed using clinical and analytical data. The

clinical data of the patients included in the study are
summarized in Table 1 and Additional file 1: Table S1.
We also studied a group of individuals with non-
infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome
(SIRS), formed by 4 patients in the immediate postop-
erative period of cardiac surgery. In this group, the
blood samples were obtained in the first 24 h of the
postoperative period. Finally, we also included blood
samples from 11 healthy controls collected from the
blood donor service of La Paz University Hospital and
Vall d’Hebron University Hospital. The Committee
for Human Subjects of La Paz University Hospital
(PIE2392) and Vall d’Hebron University Hospital (PR
(ATR)122/2019) approved the study, which was con-
ducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines of
the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki. All samples were in
compliance with the guidelines approved by the local
ethics committee, and all patients (sepsis, SIRS, and
healthy controls) received oral and written informa-
tion about the possibility that their blood would be
used
for
research
purposes
and
signed
informed
consent.
Purification of human monocytes from patients with
sepsis, SIRS, and healthy control samples
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were ob-
tained from blood by density gradient centrifugation using
lymphocyte isolation solution (Rafer, Zaragoza, Spain).
PBMCs were stained with CD14-PE (Miltenyi Biotec,
Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), CD66b-APC (STEMCELL™
Technologies, Vancouver, Canada), and Fixable Viability
Dye eFluor™520 (ThermoFisher Scientific, MA, USA),
and
then,
cells
were
fixed
with
2%
formaldehyde
methanol-free (ThermoFisher Scientific). Pure monocytes
were isolated as CD14+CD66b−cells using flow cytometry
sorting (MoFlo Astrios EQ, Beckman Coulter Spain,
L’Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain). Purified sam-
ples were pelleted and stored at −80 °C.
For in vitro experiments, we obtained buffy coats from
anonymous donors through the Catalan Blood and Tis-
sue Bank (CBTB). The CBTB follows the principles of
the World Medical Association (WMA) Declaration of
Helsinki. Before providing blood sample, all donors re-
ceived detailed oral and written information and signed
a consent form at the CBTB. PBMCs were isolated by
density gradient centrifugation. Then, PBMCs were re-
suspended in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)
Medium 1640 + GlutaMAXTM-1 (Gibco, Life Tech-
nologies, CA, USA) containing 10% human pooled
serum (One Lambda, ThermoFisher Scientific Brand,
Canoga Park, CA, USA), 100 units/ml penicillin, and
100 mg/ml streptomycin, and cells were non-treated
(control) or treated with 10 ng/ml LPS from Escherichia
coli (O111:B4, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany),
and cultured in poly-HEMA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Dallas, TX, USA)-coated plates for 4 days. After that,
monocytes were purified by cell sorting using the same
strategy as mentioned above. Alternatively, CD14+ mono-
cytes were isolated using positive selection with CD14
magnetic Microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach,
Germany) and cultured in the same conditions as PBMCs.
Purified monocytes were pelleted and stored until DNA
or RNA extraction. Supernatants were collected and
stored at −80 °C until cytokine measurement.
The endotoxin tolerance status of the septic patients
and healthy donors was evaluated by exposing whole
blood to a stimulus of 5 ng/ml LPS, collecting super-
natant after 3 h to determine the state of innate immune
system (IIS) during initial infection.
Cytokine measurements
The cytokine levels in whole blood were determined using
the cytometric bead array (CBA) Flex Set (BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA, USA), following the manufacturer’s proto-
col. The collected data were analyzed with Flow Cytomet-
ric Analysis Program (FCAP) Array Software v3.0 (BD

Biosciences). For in vitro experiments, the concentration
of cytokines was measured from the cell culture superna-
tants
using
an
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
(ELISA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA).
DNA methylation profiling using universal bead arrays,
bisulfite sequencing, and pyrosequencing
Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip (Illumina, Inc., San
Diego, CA, USA) array were used to analyze DNA
methylation. This platform allows > 850,000 methylation
sites per sample to be interrogated at single-nucleotide
resolution, covering 99% of reference sequence (RefSeq)
genes. The samples were bisulfite-converted using EZ
DNA Methylation-Gold™Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine,
CA, USA) and were hybridized in the array following the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Each methylation data point was obtained from a com-
bination of the Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescent intensities from
the M (methylated) and U (unmethylated) alleles. For
representation and further analysis, we used beta and M
values. Beta value is the ratio of the methylated probe in-
tensity to the overall intensity (the sum of the methyl-
ated and unmethylated probe intensities). The M value
is calculated as the log2 ratio of the intensities of the
methylated versus unmethylated
probe.
Beta
values
range from 0 to 1, in which 0 is no methylation and 1 is
complete methylation, and were used to derive heatmaps
and to compare DNA methylation percentages from bi-
sulfite pyrosequencing experiments. For statistical pur-
poses, the use of M values is more appropriate.
Bisulfite pyrosequencing was used to validate CpG
methylation changes. DNA was isolated using ReliaPrep™
FFPE gDNA Miniprep System (Promega, Madison, WI,
USA) for methylation array samples and with Maxwell®
RSC Cultured Cells DNA Kit (Promega, Madison, WI,
USA) for in vitro model. Bisulfite modification of genomic
DNA isolated from monocytes was performed using EZ
DNA Methylation-Gold™Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA,
USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Primers for
PCR amplification and sequencing were designed with the
PyroMark® Assay Design 2.0 software (QIAGEN, Hilden,
Germany). See list of primers in Additional file 2: Table S2.
PCRs were performed with the IMMOLASE™DNA
polymerase
PCR
kit
(Bioline
Reagents
Limited,
London, UK), and the success of amplification was
assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. PCR products
were pyrosequenced with the PyromarkTM Q24 sys-
tem (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany).
Quality control, data normalization, and detection of
differentially methylated and variable CpGs
Methylation array data were processed in the statistical
language R using methods
from
the
Bioconductor
libraries minfi, lumi, and limma. Data quality was
assessed using the standard pipeline from the minfi
package. The data were Snoob-normalized and, after
normalization, beta and M values were calculated. To
exclude technical and biological biases, we developed a
pipeline with several filters as removing CpGs with SNPs
overlapped. To minimize the potential confounding in-
fluence of age and gender, we used these parameters as
covariates.
In this study, we considered a probe to be differentially
methylated if it had a methylation differential of 15%
(Δβ ≥0.15) and when the statistical test was significant
[p < 0.01
and
false
discovery
rate
(FDR) < 0.05].
In
addition, we used the iEVORA algorithm [23] to desig-
nate a probe as differentially variable. This algorithm de-
tects the homogeneity of variances using Bartlett’s test
(FDR < 0.001) and then selects those probes whose t test
is significant (p < 0.05 and FDR < 0.05) in order to
regularize the variability test which is overly sensitive to
single outliers.
Spearman’s correlation was used to correlate methyla-
tion changes with cytokine concentration. Spearman’s
correlation coefficient is a nonparametric approach to
measuring the strength of association of two variables
being more reliable with non-linear data. We used the
parameters specified in each section for Spearman’s
analysis.
Gene ontology analysis, transcription factor (TF)
enrichment analysis, and chromatin state discovery and
characterization (ChromHMM)
Gene ontology (GO) was analyzed using the Genomic
Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool (GREAT, ver-
sion
3.0.0)
(http://great.stanford.edu/public/html/).
GREAT assigns biological meaning to a set of non-
coding genomic regions by analyzing the annotations of
the nearby genes [24]. For gene identification, we
assigned a window that extends 5 kb upstream and 5 kb
downstream from the differentially methylated CpG site.
This window allows the analysis of CpGs located in
regulatory regions distant to a TSS. Enrichment is
showed as –log10 raw binomial p values.
We used the findMotifsGenome.pl program of the
HOMER suite to look for motifs that are overrepresented
in the target set relative to the background set (software
v4.5). It was used to identify enrichment of TF binding
motifs in the 500-bp window upstream and downstream
of the differentially methylated CpG sites [25]. Annotated
CpGs in the EPIC array were used as background.
Chromatin

ment of the different chromatin states for the corre-
sponding

cate using LightCycler® 480 SYBR Green Mix (Roche,
Basel, Switzerland). Expression values were normalized
against the expression of the endogenous gene controls
as RPL38. See list of primers in Additional file 2: Table

Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed with Prism version 6.0 (GraphPad).
Statistical analyses were performed using the Mann-

cance were as follows: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
Results
Monocytes from individuals who have undergone sepsis
display an aberrant methylation signature
We first performed DNA methylation screening on mono-
cytes, sorted from peripheral blood as CD14+CD66b−
cells (Fig. 1a and Additional file 3: Figure S1), from a co-
hort of 14 septic patients (Table 1 and Additional file 1:
Table S1) and compared it with those sorted from a co-
hort of 11 healthy controls. We also included 4 patients
with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)
following cardiac surgery. For the analysis, we used bead
arrays to interrogate the DNA methylation status of > 850,
000 CpG sites across the entire genome covering 99% of
RefSeq genes. In the analysis, to minimize the potential
confounding influence of age and gender (shown in
Table 1), we used these parameters as covariates.
Principal component analysis (PCA) showed the two
groups of monocytes from patients with sepsis and con-
trols separated along the first principal component
(Fig. 1b), with the SIRS in between. Overall, we observed
a wider heterogeneity in septic monocytes than in con-
trol and SIRS monocytes (Fig. 1b), perhaps due to the di-
versity of infective bacteria (Additional file 1: Table S1).
Monocytes from sepsis patients display 595 CpG sites
with significantly higher methylation levels (hypermethy-
lated)
and
302
CpG
sites
with
significantly
lower
methylation levels (hypomethylated) than control mono-
cytes (Fig. 1c and Additional file 4: Table S3).
We performed gene ontology (GO) analysis to deter-
mine whether the differentially methylated genes were
associated with relevant biological processes in sepsis. In
the hypermethylated set, there was enrichment of im-
portant GO categories such as MAPK signaling pathway,
NF-κB signaling pathway, and inflammation mediated by
chemokine-cytokine signaling pathway. In the hypo-
methylated group, the functional categories were also
relevant in the context of immune cell biology, including
the MHC class II protein complex, genes involved in
interferon-gamma
(IFN-γ)
signaling,
and
phagocytic
vesicle membrane (Fig. 1d). The analysis of the chroma-
tin states of differentially methylated CpG sites revealed
the enrichment in active and weak enhancers (character-
ized by H3K4me1 and H3K27ac) for both the hyper-
and hypomethylated sets and also for transcription start
site (TSS) flanking regions in the case of the hyper-
methylated
set
(additionally
marked
by
H3K4me3)
(Fig. 1e).
We then inspected the enrichment of TF binding mo-
tifs among the two sets of differentially methylated CpG
sites. We observed a significant overrepresentation of
binding sites of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF)
and ETS TF families in hypermethylated regions in sep-
tic monocytes (Fig. 1f). Previous reports have shown that
ETS factors such as PU.1 can recruit DNA methyltrans-
ferases [27]. Hypermethylation could also antagonize the
function of these TFs in endotoxin response [28]. Se-
quences
around
hypomethylated
CpG
sites
were
enriched for binding motifs of the signal transducer and
activator of transcription (STAT) family (Fig. 1f). Ac-
cording to previous studies, the Janus kinase (JAK)/
STAT pathway plays a critical role in protective immun-
ity during sepsis via controlling cytokine responses
(reviewed in [29]).
Inspection of individual genes among those containing
differentially methylated CpG sites made it possible to
identify some with essential functions in monocyte/
macrophage biology and function. These included genes
such as IL1A, CCL22, CCR2, and STAT3 in the hyper-
methylated set and HLA-A, SOCS1, IL1R2, and CD46 in
the hypomethylated set (Fig. 1g and Table 2). IL1A is a
pro-inflammatory cytokine. Different pro-inflammatory
cytokines induce JAK activation, as well as the phos-
phorylation and activation of transcription activators
STAT3, STAT5, and STAT6. CCL22 and CCR2 associ-
ate with leukocyte chemotaxis. HLA-A belongs to the
MHC class I and is involved in antigen presentation.
SOCS1 encodes a member of the suppressor of cytokine
signaling (SOCS) family that is involved in negative
regulation of JAK/STAT cytokine signaling. Another ex-
ample is CD46, encoding a costimulatory factor for T

lymphocytes promoting T-regulatory 1 cells that sup-
press immune response through IL-10. All these exam-
ples
highlight
the
relationship
between
the
genes
undergoing changes in DNA methylation and pathways
related to the acquisition of endotoxin tolerance.
Septic monocytes also display increased DNA methylation
variability
As indicated above, our PCA analysis indicated a higher het-
erogeneity in the DNA methylation profiles of monocytes
from patients with sepsis. We used a recently developed al-
gorithm, named iEVORA [23], to determine significant dif-
ferentially variable CpG positions (DVPs) at an FDR < 0.05
between monocytes from patients with sepsis and healthy in-
dividuals. By using this method, we not only could confirm
the occurrence of a higher number of DVPs in monocytes
from patients with sepsis (n = 6833) versus healthy controls
(n = 148) (Fig. 2a) but also determine that many of these sites
occur at genes that also display significant DNA methylation
changes (Additional file 5: Table S4).
Similarly to our previous analysis of differentially
methylated sites, sepsis-associated DVPs mainly occur at
enhancers and also TSS flanking regions (Fig. 2b). Se-
quences surrounding these DVPs were highly enriched
in binding motifs of ETS and IRF families (Fig. 2c), again
highlighting the role of these TFs in the acquisition of
the tolerogenic phenotype of septic monocytes.
GO analysis revealed an enrichment of sepsis-associated
DVPs in positive regulation of inflammatory response,
leukocyte chemotaxis, and defense response to bacterium
and toll-like receptor binding (Fig. 2d). We found sepsis-
associated DVPs in genes important for immune response
against infection and hyperinflammation such as IL1A and
TNF (Fig. 2e and Additional file 5: Table S4).
All this suggests that a variety of factors encompassing
bacterial infection and sepsis are driving DNA methyla-
tion and phenotypic changes in these cells in a similar
manner,
regardless
of
the
infecting
bacteria
or
individual-specific clinical outcome of the individual.
DNA methylation changes in monocytes from patients
with sepsis correlate with increased IL-10 and IL-6 levels
Many of the characteristics of endotoxin-tolerized mono-
cytes/macrophages resemble that of anti-inflammatory
M2 macrophages [30, 31]. M2 macrophages show down-
regulated inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-12, TNFα) but
upregulated anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-10),
scavenger receptor expression, and efficient phagocytosis.
We wondered whether the DNA methylation patterns ob-
served in monocytes from patients with sepsis might be
associated with the generation of an immunosuppressive
or tolerogenic environment in peripheral blood.
To address this question, we first tested the levels of a
panel of cytokines associated with acute sepsis in cul-
tured PBMCs from patients with sepsis and compared it
to those in control individuals. We identified signifi-
cantly increased levels of IL-10 and IL-6 in patients with
sepsis (Fig. 3a). We also examined the levels of cytokines
following the exposure to LPS. This analysis showed that
the majority of the septic patients had acquired toler-
ance, with decreased levels of pro-inflammatory TNFα,
IL-1β, and IL-6, following exposure to LPS, and in-
creased secreted levels of anti-inflammatory IL-10, indi-
cating a higher degree of tolerogenic properties on
septic monocytes (Fig. 3a), as previously reported [32].
Given the greater heterogeneity of the methylation
profiles of septic samples with respect to those from
healthy controls, we investigated whether this could also
be related to the wider range of cytokine levels, such as
those observed for IL-10 or IL-6. To this end, we first
performed Spearman’s correlation between the DNA
methylation data and the secreted IL-10 levels, for all pa-
tients with sepsis and control individuals. This analysis
revealed that there are 855 CpG sites that become
hypermethylated and 389 CpG sites hypomethylated in
relation to increasing levels of IL-10 (r > 0.5; Δβ ≥0.15)
(Fig. 3b and Additional file 6: Table S5). This analysis
also showed that, for CpG sites associated with IL-10
levels, there is a significant difference of their median

methylated CpG sites. We observed that approximately
25% of the hypermethylated CpG sites have motifs for
bZIP TF factor family (Jun-AP-1) and 25% of the hypo-
methylated CpG sites display motifs for STAT family
members (Fig. 3e), suggesting that methylation might be
driven by the stimulation of TLR by bacteria and the in-
creased levels of IL-10, stimulating its receptor IL-10R.
Interestingly, 15% of the hypomethylated sequences dis-
played enrichment of CTCF binding motifs, whose global
occupancy has been linked to differential DNA methyla-
tion [33]. Similar results were obtained when we analyzed
the data for the Spearman’s correlation with IL-6 levels
(Additional file 7: Figure S2C and S2D).
GO analysis revealed distinct enriched biological pro-
cesses for hypo- and hypermethylated CpG clusters in
relation to IL-10 levels, including MHC class II protein
complex and response to type I IFN, and fibroblast
growth factor-activated receptor activity respectively
(Fig. 3f). Of note, similar GO categories were also
enriched for differentially methylated CpGs correlating
to IL-6 levels (Additional file 7: Figure S2B).
Our data show that many members of Wnt signal-
ing pathway (WNT3A, WNT6, and AXIN2 among
others) (Additional file 6: Table S5) display a gain of
methylation in septic monocytes compared with their
healthy counterparts, highlighting the potential link
between aberrant DNA methylation and the Wnt
pathway. In fact, cumulative evidence supports the
role of the Wnt pathway in the regulation of the
macrophage-mediated inflammatory response in sepsis
[34], in which Wnt3a and Wnt6 reduce TNFα secre-
tion and promote the differentiation towards an M2
anti-inflammatory phenotype attenuating the immune
response [35]. Furthermore, we found a large genomic
region that also displayed DNA hypermethylation in
which it predominantly covered CpG sites in the
three tandem gene clusters of protocadherin (PCDHA,
PCDHB, and PCDHG) (Fig. 3g) (Additional file 6:
Table S5). This region has previously been reported
to undergo aberrant DNA hypermethylation in cancer
and in other disorders [36, 37]. Moreover, recent
studies have identified mechanisms by which PCDHs
can regulate the Wnt pathway (reviewed in [38]),
which further corroborates the Wnt pathway as a pu-
tative therapeutic target for the patient treatment.
Regarding the hypomethylated CpG sites, we found an
enrichment in genes involved in the IFN-γ pathway,
which is essential for antimicrobial defense and restoring
monocyte deactivation in patients with sepsis [39]. Re-
markably, among the CpG sites displaying changes in
methylation in relation to IL-10 levels, we identified 23
CpG sites within the HLA cluster, which is also induced
by the IFN-γ and JAK/STAT pathway [40] (Fig. 3g).
Monocytes exposed to LPS undergo DNA methylation
changes in parallel with the acquisition of endotoxin
tolerance
Our results suggest that TLR stimulation and the inflam-
matory environment generated in the context of sys-
temic
bacterial infection
are able
to induce DNA
methylation changes in monocytes. First, the specific
DNA methylation profiles of monocytes from patients
with sepsis associate with IL-10 and IL-6 levels. Second,
there is an enrichment of binding motifs for AP-1 and
STATs. This suggests that both the stimulation of TLRs,
the resulting inflammatory conditions, and subsequent
anti-inflammatory signals, participate in shaping the
generation of aberrant methylation profiles which might
modulate and stabilize the phenotype of monocytes fol-
lowing a septic episode. We therefore explored the
possibility
of
inducing
in
vitro
DNA
methylation
changes observed in such conditions by exposing in
parallel PBMCs and monocytes from healthy individ-
uals to LPS, and compare it with PBMCs and mono-
cytes without such stimulation (Fig. 4a). We cultured
the cells for 4 days and measured the acquisition of
tolerance.

PBMCs,

Specifically, these assays showed decreased levels of
TNFα and increased levels of IL-10 in a second LPS
exposure for those cells that had a first exposure to
LPS (Fig. 4b). We then performed pyrosequencing of
a selection of hypo- and hypermethylated genes in
septic
monocytes.
Our
analysis
revealed
that
the
in vitro stimulation with LPS is able to induce DNA
methylation changes in these genes (Fig. 4c) with a similar
trend to the changes observed in patients with sepsis when

PBMCs were exposed to LPS (followed by monocyte
purification). In the case of monocytes directly exposed to
LPS, we were able to stimulate only demethylation of the
IL1R2 gene, suggesting that perhaps signals from other
cell types are necessary to induce gains of methylation
following LPS treatment. Interestingly, changes in DNA
methylation at the aforementioned sites occurred in asso-
ciation with changes in gene expression of these genes
(Fig. 4d, e) in the two sets of samples exposed to LPS, and
not in controls. In addition, we also observed an increase
in mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and
IL6) in LPS-treated cells. These results proved that both
gains and losses of DNA methylation and expression in
septic monocytes are the result of TLR stimulation and
the generation of an inflammatory environment and are
associated with the acquisition of a tolerized state in
monocytes.
Organ dysfunction associates with DNA methylation
changes
We finally tested DNA methylation profiles in relation
to SOFA, the main score used to assess organ dysfunc-
tion. When using Spearman correlation, we determined
that there are 1890 CpG sites that become hypermethy-
lated and 1536 CpG sites hypomethylated in relation to
increasing SOFA (p value < 0.01; r > 0.6) (Fig. 5a and
Additional file 9: Table S7). GO analysis revealed that
DNA methylation changes in relation to SOFA affect in-
flammatory response and antigen presentation in a simi-
lar manner than previous comparisons (Fig. 5b). We also
investigated for this set of CpG sites the enrichment in
TF binding motifs for these differentially methylated
CpG sites. We obtained similar sets of TF binding motifs
(Fig. 5c) like the ones observed for the correlations with
IL-10 and IL-6, suggesting the participation of these in-
flammatory cytokines in the acquisition of DNA methy-
lation changes in relation to organic damage. Finally,
individual inspection of the lists revealed the association
of several relevant molecules including HLA-A, IL19,
IL15, and IL27 (Fig. 5d). Altogether, this analysis sug-
gested that the DNA methylation changes associated
with organic damage involve similar changes to those
observed in relation to inflammatory cytokines.
Discussion
Our study demonstrates for the first time the existence
of DNA methylation alterations in human monocytes
from individuals following a sepsis episode in relation to
the acquisition of a tolerized phenotype, paralleling data
obtained in a mouse model [41]. Most notably, changes
occur in genes relevant to the function of these cells in-
cluding the interferon-gamma-mediated pathway and
MHC class II proteins. On the one hand, the observed
methylation changes in patients with sepsis suggest their
participation among the mechanisms leading to the gen-
eration of an aberrant phenotype of these cells. On the
other hand, correlation analyses of the DNA methylation
profiles in relation to IL-10 and IL-6 levels, which are in-
creased in patients with sepsis, suggest a potential mech-
anism downstream to these cytokines participating in
the defective generation of DNA methylation alterations.
Furthermore, in vitro analysis of the influence of bacter-
ial LPS and inflammatory context in determining the ac-
quisition of DNA methylation alterations in monocytes
also shows how these changes associate with aberrant
transcriptional levels of dysregulated genes. Finally, our
analysis shows increasing changes in DNA methylation
in relation to organ dysfunction.
Epigenetic factors play a role in the acquisition of endo-
toxin tolerance. In fact, seminal studies by the teams of
Netea, Logie, and Stunnenberg have shown that the tran-
scriptional inactivity in response to a second LPS exposure
in tolerized macrophages is accompanied by a failure to de-
posit active histone marks at promoters of tolerized genes
[17]. It has also been reported that leukocytes of patients
with sepsis have defects in important metabolism pathways
and, interestingly, these immunometabolic defects were
partially restored by therapy with recombinant IFN-γ [7].
The aforementioned studies paid less attention to
DNA methylation changes, as they appeared to be less
prevalent than those at occurring in histone modifica-
tions. However, DNA methylation is a relatively more
stable epigenetic mark than histone modifications. That
property makes this modification worth of study: firstly,
because it might have a long-term contribution to the
tolerized state of monocytes, and secondly, because it
could potentially be used as a marker, if associations
with patient prognosis and/or progression were found.
Many of the genes displaying differentially methylated
CpG sites between patients with sepsis and controls
occur within a limited number of pathways relevant to
the stimulation associated with bacterial infection (Fig. 6).
For instance, genes experiencing changes in methylation
such as IL1A, IL1R2, IL1R1, TAB2, TAB1, MAP 2K1,
and MAP 3K1 occur within the same signaling pathway,
which is also merging from the signals downstream to
TNF. On the other hand, several of the genes encoding
for cytokines like IL27, IL23A, IL19, and IL22 also dis-
play CpG sites undergoing methylation changes, as well
as genes encoding elements downstream to it, such as
TYK2, JAK1, STAT3 and 4, and SOCS3 and SOCS5. The
relationship between all these genes suggests two possi-
bilities: that DNA methylation changes at these sites
have a causal effect in determining the activation or re-
pression of the associated genes or, alternatively, that
the monocyte methylome is acting as a sensor of the ac-
tivation of these pathways through additional or alterna-
tive mechanisms.

In this respect, our results show that monocytes from
patients with sepsis harbor an aberrant DNA methylation
signature that is related with the abnormal environment
derived from such inflammatory condition. Furthermore,
we have determined that DNA methylation changes cor-
relate with increased IL-10 and IL-6 levels and that those
changes are functionally annotated to genes belonging to
the Wnt and IFN-γ signaling pathways. In this respect, it
has been demonstrated, as mentioned above, that IFN-
γ-based therapy can partially restore the defective
metabolic
changes
occurring
in
leukocytes
from
patients with sepsis [7].
Finally, our investigation demonstrates the sensitivity
of monocytes to translate environmental changes into
more stable changes at the transcriptional level through
DNA methylation. Given that sepsis is associated with
the generation of a particular cytokine environment [42],
our results reinforce the notion that epigenetic changes
are related to the maintenance of the dysregulated im-
mune response following an episode of sepsis. However,
with the existing data generated in this study, we cannot
distinguish whether these epigenetic changes are a cause
or a consequence: in other words, whether the DNA
methylation changes are caused by these individuals’ in-
fection history, perhaps influenced by the environment,
or whether environmental factors cause the generation
of the aberrant DNA methylation signature, which is
then accompanied by immune responses that are sec-
ondary to the sepsis. It is likely that the aberrant DNA
methylation (and expression signature) generated as a
result of the particular cytokine milieu generated under
the
sepsis
episode
contributes
to
perpetuating
the

tolerized state of these monocytes. Whether
those
changes also affect bone marrow monocyte progenitors
giving
long-lasting
reprogramming,
as
occurs
with
trained immunity [43], remains to be investigated. Inter-
estingly, the observed changes appear to be reflective of
the infection, as it suggests the data obtained for SIRS
patients (even if it is a small cohort), which are also
characterized by inflammation and organ dysfunction.
A potential limitation of our study is the size and char-
acteristics of the cohort. In future studies, it would be
necessary to use vaster cohorts, including patients with a
representative number of Gram-positive and Gram-
negative bacteria and patients at different stages follow-
ing the sepsis episode. However, the size and features of
our cohort, on the other hand, indicate that common
changes in DNA methylation are associated with sepsis
regardless of the infective bacteria. The identification of
specific DNA methylation markers associated with the
infecting organism of the clinical outcome of the patient
will surely be useful for predicting the evolution of the
patients and perhaps their clinical management.
Conclusions
In the present study, we have shown that patients with
sepsis undergo widespread changes in the methylome of
their circulating monocytes in parallel with the acquisi-
tion of endotoxin tolerance. Thousands of changes are
associated with the aberrant levels of IL-10 and IL-6, as
well as with organ dysfunction. Stimulation of the Toll-
like receptor in monocytes induces similar changes in
DNA methylation and expression, concomitant with the
acquired tolerance that points to a major role in the
stabilization of a tolerized phenotype through these al-
terations. Our results open up possibilities not only to
use DNA methylation as a marker for disease but also
for understanding its role in the acquisition of the aber-
rant phenotype of these cells.
