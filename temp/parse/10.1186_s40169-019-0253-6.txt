Abstract 
Background:  Despite the well described heterogeneity in glioblastoma (GBM), treatment is standardized, and clini‑
cal trials investigate treatment effects at population level. Genomics-driven oncology for stratified treatments allow 
clinical decision making in only a small minority of screened patients. Addressing tumor heterogeneity, we aimed to 
establish a clinical translational protocol in recurrent GBM (recGBM) utilizing autologous glioblastoma stem cell (GSC) 
cultures and automated high-throughput drug sensitivity and resistance testing (DSRT) for individualized treatment 
within the time available for clinical application.
Results:  From ten patients undergoing surgery for recGBM, we established individual cell cultures and characterized 
the GSCs by functional assays. 7/10 GSC cultures could be serially expanded. The individual GSCs displayed inter‑
tumoral differences in their proliferative capacity, expression of stem cell markers and variation in their in vitro and 
in vivo morphology. We defined a time frame of 10 weeks from surgery to complete the entire pre-clinical work-up; 
establish individualized GSC cultures, evaluate drug sensitivity patterns of 525 anticancer drugs, and identify options 
for individualized treatment. Within the time frame for clinical translation 5/7 cultures reached sufficient cell yield for 
complete drug screening. The DSRT revealed significant intertumoral heterogeneity to anticancer drugs (p < 0.0001). 
Using curated reference databases of drug sensitivity in GBM and healthy bone marrow cells, we identified individual‑
ized treatment options in all patients. Individualized treatment options could be selected from FDA-approved drugs 
from a variety of different drug classes in all cases.
Conclusions:  In recGBM, GSC cultures could successfully be established in the majority of patients. The individual 
cultures displayed intertumoral heterogeneity in their in vitro and in vivo behavior. Within a time frame for clini‑
cal application, we could perform DSRT in 50% of recGBM patients. The DSRT revealed a remarkable intertumoral 
heterogeneity in sensitivity to anticancer drugs in recGBM that could allow tailored therapeutic options for functional 
precision medicine.

Background
Glioblastoma (GBM) is a devastating form of cancer. 
Despite multidisciplinary treatment, the tumor almost 
invariably recurs within 9 months [1, 2]. For the recur-
rent disease, there are no treatment options documented 
to prolong survival, possibly leaving enrollment into a 
clinical trial the best treatment option [3].
The survival benefit of repeated tumor resection in 
recurrent GBM (recGBM) is limited [4, 5]. Subsequently, 
only a minority of patients with recGBM undergo sec-
ondary surgery [1].
In the newly diagnosed GBM, sphere-forming glio-
blastoma stem cells (GSCs) derived from tumor biopsies 
is a well-studied and relevant model system of the treat-
ment-naïve disease [6–9]. There exists, however, limited 
data of the GSC population in recGBM [10]. The biology 
of the recurrent disease, which ultimately is the disease 
the patients succumb to, therefore remains inadequately 
described. In turn, this leads to a clinical translational 
gap, as early phase clinical trials in GBM mostly recruit 
patients with recurrent disease while the foundation of 
these new treatments almost exclusively are based on 
treatment-naïve primary GBM models [10].
The intricate tumor heterogeneity at the cellular and 
molecular level in the treatment-naïve GBM poses a sub-
stantial challenge for therapeutic progress on its own 
[11–14], but even more for treatment of the relapsed 
disease. Recent studies have described a longitudinal 
heterogeneity of tumor evolution following therapy, as 
the selection pressure exerted by standard treatment 
display tumor-to-tumor variability [15–18]. A fraction 
of relapsed tumors seems phylogenetically derived from 
dominant clones in the primary tumors, while others 
display a highly branched subclonal tumor evolution 
[15–17]. A minority of tumors develop a treatment-
induced hypermutational phenotype at recurrence [19, 
20]. Despite established tumoral and evolutional hetero-
geneity in GBM, clinical trials are still mostly designed 
to investigate treatment effects at the population level 
[21–23].
A therapeutic strategy to address tumor heterogeneity 
is matching the right drug to the individual patient using 
genomics-driven profiling. However, genomics-driven 
oncology for individualized treatments allows clinical 
decision making in only a small minority of screened 
patients. Even in the presence of a druggable oncogenic 
mutation the clinical applicability of targeted therapies 
has proven difficult [24–26]. Individualized treatments 
may also be constructed using functional approaches by 
automated drug screening technology for testing of hun-
dreds of anticancer compounds directly to a patient’s 
cancer cells ex vivo [27].
We have previously described the intertumoral het-
erogeneity in patient-specific drug sensitivity patterns 
in the treatment-naïve GBM [13]. However, the feasibil-
ity of translating automated drug sensitivity testing of a 
patient`s cancer cells ex vivo to individualized treatment 
in solid tumors is immature [28]. This study therefore 
aimed to establish a bed-to-bench-to-bed clinical trans-
lational protocol for individualized treatment in recGBM 
utilizing patient-specific recGBM stem cell cultures and 
high-throughput drug sensitivity and resistance test-
ing (DSRT). To evaluate feasibility, we investigated (i) 
the capability to propagate GSC cultures from recGBM 
ex  vivo, (ii) how tumor heterogeneity in recGBM is 
reflected in drug sensitivity patterns to a large panel of 
anticancer drugs, and (iii) whether individualized treat-
ment options can be suggested using automated drug 
screening and drug sensitivity scoring within a time 
frame suitable for clinical translation.
Methods
Brain tumor biopsies and cell cultures
Glioblastoma biopsies were obtained from ten informed 
patients with explicit written consent undergoing sur-
gery for recGBM at Oslo University Hospital, Norway, 
as approved by The Norwegian Regional Committee for 
Medical Research Ethics (REK 07321b, 2017/167). The 
cell cultures were established both from several focal 
tumor biopsies and the ultrasonic aspirate generated 
during surgery. The cell cultures were established and 
maintained under tumorsphere forming conditions, as 
previously described [6]. Differentiation was induced, and 
the cells were fixed and stained, as previously described 
[6]. Images were acquired using Olympus Soft Imag-
ing Xcellence software v.1.1. The total number of cells in 
serial passaging was quantified as previously described 
[13]. All experiments in this study have been performed 
within the 10th passage of the individual culture. Patient 
characteristics are summarized in Additional file 1.
Definition of time frame of clinical protocol
In cohorts after resection of recGBM the median pro-
gression-free survival is reported ranging from 2.0 to 
7.8 months [5, 29, 30]. To evaluate the feasibility of using 
autologous recurrent GSC cultures for individualized

therapy, we defined a fixed time frame of 10 weeks from 
surgery to complete the entire pre-clinical work up; 
which included cell culture expansion (6  weeks), DSRT 
and data analysis (1  week), and treatment initiation 
(3 weeks).
Flow cytometry analysis
Cells were suspended in PBS with 2% fetal bovine serum 
(Biochrom) and stained with directly conjugated anti-
bodies (CD15-PerCP, R&D Systems, CD44-APC, Thermo 
Fisher Scientific, CD133-PE, Miltenyi Biotec, CXCR4-PE, 
Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. Cells were washed three times before analysis 
by flow cytometer LSRII (BD Bioscience). FlowJo soft-
ware v.10.4.1 was used for data analysis. Dead cells were 
excluded by propidium iodine (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 
and doublets were excluded by gating.
Intracranial transplantation
The National Animal Research Authority approved all 
animal procedures (FOTS 8318). C.B.-17 SCID female 
mice (7–9  weeks old, Taconic, Ejby, Denmark) were 
anesthetized with a subcutaneous injection of zolaz-
epam (3.3  mg/mL), tiletamine (3.3  mg/mL), xylazine 
(0.45  mg/mL) and fentanyl (2.6  μg/mL). The cells were 
prepared and 2 μL of a single cell suspension containing 
100,000 cells/μL was xenografted into the right striatum, 
as previously described [6]. The animals were regularly 
monitored for signs of distress and killed by cervical dis-
location after 15 weeks or earlier if weight loss > 15% or 
neurological symptoms developed. The brains were har-
vested and further processed as previously described [6]. 
Images of brain sections were acquired using Axio Scan.
Z1 (Carl Zeiss). Processing of images was performed 
using ImageJ 2.0.
qRT‑PCR
RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen 
GmbH) and evaluated by Nanodrop spectrophotom-
eter (Thermo Fisher) and Experion System (Bio-Rad). 
The high capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit, 
TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix, TaqMan oligonu-
cleotide primers and probes [Hs00157674_m1 (GFAP), 
Hs00801390_s1 (TUBB3)] and the ABI Prism Detec-
tion System and software (all from Applied Biosystems) 
were used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Human β-Actin [Hs9999999903_m1 (ACTB)] was used 
as housekeeping gene. The thermal cycling conditions 
were 20 s at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 1 s at 95 °C 
and 20 s at 60 °C. The relative gene expression levels were 
calculated using the standard curve method.
Subclassification of GSC cultures
Subgrouping of the GSC cultures as proneural or mes-
enchymal was performed by analyzing RNA sequenc-
ing data. The library preparation was performed using 
the Truseq mRNA protocol according to the manufac-
turer and the samples sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 
platform (paired end 2 × 75 bp). Normalized expression 
data was further analyzed in J-Express 2012. Unsuper-
vised hierarchical clustering was performed as previously 
described [13].
Drug sensitivity and resistance testing
The oncology drug collection consisted of 525 antican-
cer compounds and covered most U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration and European Medicines Agency (FDA/
EMA)-approved anticancer drugs and investigational 
compounds with a broad range of molecular targets. 
35% (184/525) of the drugs were of approved status 
(both oncological and non-oncological indications). 48% 
(252/525) of the drugs were in clinical investigational 
phases, and the rest (17%, 89/525) in preclinical inves-
tigations. Overview of the drug collection is provided 
in Additional file  2. The high-throughput DSRT was 
undertaken using an automated facility at the Institute 
for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, 
Finland, as previously described [13]. The cells were 
transported in L-15 (Lonza) as tumorspheres on ice. 
The complete drug screening required > 107  cells. The 
patient-derived recurrent GSCs were plated at a density 
of 3000  cells/well in pre-drugged plates and after 72  h 
cell viability was measured using CellTiter-Glo® Lumi-
nescent Cell Viability Assay, (Promega), as previously 
described [13]. The resulting data were normalized to 
positive (benzethonium chloride) and negative (DMSO) 
control wells. The quantification of drug sensitivity was 
utilized by the drug sensitivity score (DSS) [13, 31]. 
In brief, each drug was evaluated over a 5-point dose-
escalating pattern covering the therapeutic range. The 
resulting dose–responses were analyzed by automated 
curve fitting defined by the top and bottom asymptote, 
the slope, and the inflection point ­(EC50). The curve fit-
ting parameters were used to calculate the area defined 
as area of drug activity (between 10% threshold and 100% 
relative inhibition to positive and negative control) rela-
tive to the total area. To reduce the impact of toxic drug 
effects, the integrated response was divided by the loga-
rithm of the top asymptote, as previously described [31]. 
The quantification of drug sensitivity was then calculated 
into a single measure as the DSS. The DSS ranges from 
0 to 50, where higher number translates into increased 
drug efficacy. The selective drug sensitivity score (sDSS) 
of each compound was calculated using two independent

reference databases; (i) our in-house GBM drug screen-
ing database (up to n = 18 GBMs tested for drug sensi-
tivity to the drug collection) and (ii) the FIMM database 
of drug sensitivity to normal bone marrow cells from 
healthy donors (n = 5). Control samples of normal bone 
marrow cells were obtained from informed and consent-
ing donors, and the sampling was approved by the insti-
tutional ethics committee, as previously described [27, 
32]. The DSS from which the GBM reference database is 
based upon is available from previous reports by [13] us 
together with the additional files presented in this study. 
The sDSS was quantified as the difference between DSS 
in the individual sample to the average DSS of GBMs 
(denoted ­sDSSGBM), and as the difference between DSS in 
the individual sample to the average DSS of normal bone 
marrow cells (denoted ­sDSSBM). The selection of refer-
ence database is stated in the text when the analysis was 
applied.
Temozolomide treatment
Cells were plated at 5000  cells/well in a 96-well plate 
(Sarstedt), cultured for 24  h before adding TMZ. The 
efficacy of TMZ was evaluated over a 5-point dose-esca-
lating pattern covering the therapeutic range (therapeu-
tic range: 5.0–50 µM, test range 0.4–250 µM) [33]. Cell 
viability was assessed after 10  days of incubation using 
Cell Proliferation Kit II XTT (Roche) solution, according 
to the manufacturer’s instructions. The absorbance was 
analyzed on a PerkinElmer EnVision. The resulting data 
were normalized to positive (sepantronium bromide) 
and negative (DMSO) control wells. The resulting dose-
response was analyzed by the DSS, as stated above.
Statistical considerations
Data analysis and graphic presentation were undertaken 
using GraphPad Prism 8.0, J-Express 2012 (Molmine), 
Keynote 9.0.2, Microsoft Excel 14.7.3 and R. Corre-
spondence analysis of drug responses and evaluation of 
the tumorsphere subgrouping were performed using 
J-Express 2012 (Molmine). Unsupervised hierarchical 
clustering and heat maps were generated using J-Express 
2012, GraphPad Prism 8.0, and R. Statistical analysis of 
the overall drug sensitivity between cultures was per-
formed using non-parametric one-way ANOVA of ranks 
with Kruskal–Wallis test. Correction for multiple com-
parisons was done by Dunn’s test. The correlation anal-
yses were performed using Spearman correlation (ρ). A 
p-value < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
Recurrent GBM patient characteristics
The recurrent GSC (recGSC) cultures were established 
from ten patients undergoing surgery for recGBM. 9/10 
patients had completed standard-of-care treatment for 
primary GBM consisting of surgery followed by con-
comitant radiotherapy (RT) and chemotherapy with 
TMZ and thereafter adjuvant TMZ. One primary tumor 
(T1532) was at the time of diagnosis classified as an ana-
plastic oligoastrocytoma, ­IDHwt without 1p/19q loss, 
that following the recent updated classification of glio-
mas now would be considered an anaplastic astrocytoma 
with molecular features of GBM. This patient underwent 
surgery followed by RT before recurrence of a GBM. One 
patient (T1615) was included at the third surgery. The 
median time from primary surgery to tumor relapse was 
11.9 months (range: 5.1–23.6). All relapsed tumors were 
unifocal and recurred within 2 cm of the resection cav-
ity from the primary surgery. Postoperative MRI dem-
onstrated five complete and five subtotal resections with 
minimal contrast enhancing residual tumor volume. The 
clinical characteristics are provided in Additional file 1.
Preclinical characterization of autologous recurrent GSC 
cultures
To allow for a wide drug screen, the DSRT required 
­107 cells. For translation to patient treatment within 
10 weeks, the cell yield had to be sufficient within 6 weeks 
of culturing (the time frame is schematically outlined in 
Fig. 1). Seven of the ten cultured recGBM biopsies could 
be maintained for > 10 serial passages, with six forming 
tumorspheres and one (T1608) proliferating with adher-
ent morphology. Three samples could not be maintained 
in culture. Of the seven samples capable of long-term 
culturing, five reached the pre-determined cell yield 
within 6 weeks.
To explore stem cell properties of the individual 
cultures, the recGSC cultures with the capacity for 
long-term self-renewal (n = 7) were characterized by 
functional assays (Fig. 2, Additional file 3). The individual 
cultures maintained their unique spheroid or adherent 
morphology upon serial passages (Fig.  2a–c, additional 
file 3). Within 15 weeks of grafting to immunodeficient 
mice, invasive intracranial tumors were formed in 6/7 
recGSC cultures. The degree of tumor bulk formation 
and invasive pattern, however, displayed considerable 
tumor-to-tumor variability (Fig. 2a–c, Additional file 3). 
Further intertumoral differences were observed in the 
expression of GSC markers, the total cell yield following 
serial passaging, in vitro differentiation morphology and 
in their ability to express glial and neuronal lineage spe-
cific markers upon differentiation (Fig. 2a–f, Additional 
file  3). Similar to GSC cultures from treatment-naïve 
GBM [13], the recGSC cultures displayed intertumoral 
heterogeneity in their in  vitro and in  vivo morphology, 
while preserving their individual traits, thus representing 
an individualized model of its parent tumor.

Within the time frame of 6  weeks for expansion, five 
of seven recGSC cultures had sufficient cell numbers to 
undergo DSRT. For broader evaluation of drug sensitiv-
ity patterns in recGBM, one additional culture (T1532) 
underwent further culturing to reach adequate cell num-
bers for DSRT. Median passage number at the time of 
screening was 4.5 (range: 1–6).
Intertumoral heterogeneity in drug sensitivity in recGBM
We next explored whether tumor heterogeneity in 
recGSC cultures is reflected in the drug sensitivity to 
anticancer drugs using automated high-throughput 
technology. We have previously defined a DSS ≥ 10 as 
the threshold to classify a drug response as moder-
ate to strong [13]. In total 148 drugs (28% of the drug 
collection) displayed this response in the recGSC cul-
ture cohort. The median was 63 drugs (range: 52–109) 
(Fig. 3a, b). Similar to the treatment-naïve disease [13], 
the sensitivity to any given drug was heterogeneous as 
55% (82/148) of drugs with a DSS ≥ 10 displayed inter-
tumoral differences equal to a moderate to strong drug 
sensitivity (∆DSS ≥ 10, ­DSSmax − DSSmin). The overall 
sensitivity to the entire drug collection (n = 525) signif-
icantly differed between the cultures (p < 0.0001), and 
according to overall drug sensitivity the cultures were 
separated into two major clusters as the most (T1516, 
T1532, T1534) and the least (T1513, T1544, T1608) 
sensitive cultures (Fig.  3c). Correspondence analy-
sis of the drug responses to the entire drug collection 
(n = 525 drugs) spread the cultures (n = 6) along the 
first component variance (25.6%) according to similar 
patterns in drug sensitivity. The clustering clearly sepa-
rated T1516 and T1532 away from T1608. The second 
component variance (22.9%) clearly separated one cul-
ture (T1534) away from the others, however, we could 
not identify a shared pattern of the clustering.
We have previously reported on the biological con-
sistency of the GSC model system in preserving indi-
vidual drug sensitivity and resistance patterns [13]. The 
same consistency was found in cultures derived from 
the recurrent disease (Fig. 3e–g, Additional files 4, 5). 
For instance, among pan-HER inhibitors (n = 4), T1532 
was the most sensitive culture to all inhibitors within 
that class (Fig.  3e). Correlation matrices displayed an 
excellent correlation (Spearman, ρ) with an average 
ranked correlation (± standard deviation) of pan-HER 
inhibitors of 0.90 (± 0.08, Fig.  3f, g). The similar pat-
tern was found for drug resistance. While being the 
most sensitive to pan-HER inhibitors, T1532 was found 
to be the most resistant culture to CDK inhibitors. 
The correlation matrices displayed an average correla-
tion (± standard deviation) of 0.82 (± 0.15) (Additional 
file 4). These patterns confirmed the findings from the 
treatment-naïve disease that individual drug sensitivity

chemotherapy for 6 weeks and thereafter monthly adjuvant chemotherapy. Despite this multimodal treatment the disease almost invariably recurs 
within 9 months. The time frame for this clinical protocol was defined as 10 weeks following surgery for recurrent GBM, which included expansion 
of individualized GSC cultures for 6 weeks, automated high-throughput drug screening and data analysis for 1 weeks and scheduling a treatment 
plan and initiation within 3 weeks

derived GSC culture model.
We next evaluated the overall heterogeneity in patient-
specific drug sensitivity according to classes of drugs. 
Selecting drugs based on DSS ≥ 10 (above moderate 
efficacy) and ­sDSSGBM ≥ 5 (high patient-specificity), 
we found a remarkable heterogeneity in the individ-
ual recGSC cultures sensitivity to different classes of 
anticancer drugs. The drugs comprised a variety of 
classes and mechanistic targets including conventional

chemotherapies (antimitotics), hormone therapies (estro-
gen receptor inhibitors), metabolic modifiers (statins) 
and several different kinase inhibitors (CDK-, Chk1-, 
EGFR-, HER-, and MEK1/2 inhibitors) (Fig. 3h).
After establishing differences in overall drug sensitivity 
and in individual drug sensitivity patterns in the recGSC 
culture cohort, unsupervised hierarchical clustering of 
selective drug responses (by ­sDSSGBM) revealed that the 
relationship of cultures with similar drug sensitivity pat-
terns was linked to the mechanistic target of the drugs 
(Fig. 4, Additional files 6, 7).
Sensitivity to temozolomide in recGSCs
As 6/7 of the recurrent GBM patients had been treated 
with TMZ, the recGSCs should in principle be TMZ-
resistant. This could be used to evaluate the validity of 
the drug screening. In the DSRT none of the recGSC 
cultures displayed any sensitivity to TMZ (DSS = 0 in 
all cultures, Additional file 5). To evaluate sensitivity to 
alkylating agents in clinically relevant concentrations, 
we and others have previously reported that cell viability 
assays require longer incubation for adequate evaluation 
[34, 35]. We therefore performed additional cell viabil-
ity assays of 10 days incubation using clinically relevant 
concentrations in the seven recGSC cultures. None of the 
cultures displayed any sensitivity to TMZ correspond-
ing to at least moderate efficacy. The median DSS was 
1.2 (range: 0.0–6.1). The resistance to TMZ was linked 
to MGMT gene promoter status. 6/7 cultures were clas-
sified as MGMT promoter unmethylated (cut off < 10%), 
while one culture (T1534) was 79.5% MGMT promotor 
methylated but still TMZ resistant at recurrence (Addi-
tional file 8).
Functional precision medicine for individualized therapy 
in recurrent GBM
The heterogeneity in drug sensitivity in recGBM was 
found in the individual cultures at the level of overall 
sensitivity, in sensitivity to specific drug classes, and in 
sensitivity to individual drugs with specific mechanistic 
targets. The DSRT could therefore identify individual-
ized treatment options in each patient-derived recGSC 
culture. For individualized therapy selection, we focused 
on compounds that exhibited at least a moderate drug 
response (DSS ≥ 10) combined with a selective drug 
response (sDSS) to the individual patient (Fig.  5a). For 
patient-specific drug response evaluation, we utilized our 
in-house reference databases of drug sensitivity (data-
base of drug sensitivity in (i) GBM and (ii) bone marrow 
cells from healthy donors) to quantify the differential 
responses (Fig. 5b).
The DSRT revealed remarkable intertumoral hetero-
geneity in drug sensitivities for individualized therapy 
(Fig. 5, Additional file 9). For instance, T1534, which was 
found as one of the most sensitive cultures to the entire 
drug collection, and clearly separating along the second 
component variance in correspondence analysis, had 
highly patient-specific responses to a diverse range of 
drug classes including checkpoint kinase 1 inhibitors, 
estrogen receptor inhibitors and statins (Fig. 5b, c). Addi-
tionally, single drug responses from a range of classes 
and mechanistic targets were identified, e.g. indibulin 
(conventional chemotherapy), daporinad (metabolic 
modifier), chloroquine (antimalarial drug/autophagy 
inhibitor), BAY 87-2243 (HIF1 inhibitor) and several dif-
ferent kinase inhibitors (the PI3K-inhibitor copanlisib 
and the PAK-inhibitor FRAX486). Several of the patient-
specific drug responses were from drugs of approved sta-
tus (e.g. atorvastatin, chloroquine, clomifene, copanlisib, 
raloxifene, simvastatin) with potential for fast clinical 
translation.
We identified effective (DSS ≥ 10) and selective (with 
both ­sDSSGBM and ­sDSSBM ≥ 5) anticancer drugs with 
approved status in all recGSC cultures (Fig. 5b–g, Addi-
tional files 10, 11). The number of drugs of approved 
status differed among the cultures, demonstrating that 
selection of drugs for patient treatment is more complex 
in certain tumors. Further highly selective drug responses 
(DSS ≥ 10 and both ­sDSSGBM and ­sDSSBM ≥ 10) of either 
approved drugs or drugs in clinical developmental phases 
were found in 5/6 recGSC cultures that underwent DSRT, 
suggesting potential for patient-specific therapy options 
with highly selective drugs for functional precision medi-
cine (Fig. 5, Additional file 9).
Discussion
This study demonstrates the feasibility of a bed-to-bench-
to-bed clinical translational protocol in recGBM utilizing 
automated drug screening and autologous recGSC cul-
tures for individualized therapy selection. From surgical 
biopsies in recGBM, we were able to expand GSCs form 
70% of the patients and generate adequate cell numbers 
from 50% within a clinically acceptable time period. The 
DSRT revealed patient-specific drug vulnerabilities to 
single drugs, as well as classes of drugs, with the potential 
for fast clinical translation. The sensitivity profiles cov-
ered a range of drug classes and molecular targets that 
demonstrated a remarkable intertumoral heterogeneity 
in drug sensitivity patterns in recGSCs.
The complex heterogeneity in GBM represents a sub-
stantial challenge for therapeutic progress. The heteroge-
neity in primary GBMs have widely been described at the 
cellular [9], and molecular [11, 12, 14] level, resulting in 
a heterogeneous clinical picture evident by interpatient 
differences in tumor growth kinetics [36], response to 
current therapies and survival [37]. Recent studies have

looked into the biology of the relapsed disease and added 
new dimensions of heterogeneity by describing tumor-to-
tumor variations in evolutionary dynamics of treatment 
resistant tumor cell populations [15–17]. This translates 
into a complex intertumoral heterogeneity at the time 
of recurrence of GBM. Consequently, targets identified 
based on analyses of the of the untreated disease may 
not be informative in treating the heavy-pretreated and 
relapsed GBM. As expected, we found intertumoral het-
erogeneity in patient-derived recGSC cultures in their

proliferative capacity, phenotype of xenograft (tumor 
bulk and invasion patterns), and patient-specific sensi-
tivities to anticancer drugs. Together, this supports the 
notions that treatment strategies in recGBM should be 
individualized and must be translated from preclinical 
studies using material and models from recGBM.
The natural course of recGBM leads to rapid disease 
progression and clinical deterioration. This makes it chal-
lenging to establish a direct clinical translational protocol 
utilizing time-consuming generation of individualized 
cell cultures. Inclusion following this protocol is inher-
ently limited to patients eligible for secondary surgery. It 
has been estimated that up to 30% of recGBM are acces-
sible to undergo secondary surgery [3, 4]. Such estimates, 
however, are primarily based on studies with a retrospec-
tive design. In cohorts of recGBM patients enrolled in 
clinical surgical trials the fraction of patients undergoing 
secondary surgery are reported to be considerably higher 
[2, 5]. This protocol further relies on the ability to suc-
cessfully establish cell cultures. The success rate has been 
reported to be as low as 30% and 25% in primGBM and 
recGBM, respectively [38]. In an operating series, we 
have previously reported a success rate of establishing 
cell cultures in > 70% of first surgery GBM biopsies [7], 
which compares similarly to the success rate in estab-
lishing individual cell cultures from recGBM in this 
study. However, as we defined a time frame of 6 weeks 
for cell culture establishment and proliferation this fur-
ther selected 50% of the total patient cohort eligible for 
treatment. There are, however, some adjustable variables 
in this protocol. The extent of DSRT can be adjusted by 
reducing the number of drugs (e.g. 17% of the drugs are 
in preclinical development not available for fast clinical 
translation). The number of drugs can also be custom-
ized to the individual cell culture according to the total 
cell yield for faster DSRT to allow for a higher fraction of 
patients to be screened at a lower complexity.
The fixed time frame of 10 weeks for this protocol may 
seem rigid. After performing 6  weeks of cell culturing 
and 1 week for DSRT and analysis, this leaves 3 weeks for 
treatment planning and implementation. The time period 
was chosen to evaluate the feasibility of finalizing the 
preclinical work-up for clinical translation in a heteroge-
neous recGBM population. We acknowledge that some 
patients experience disease progress within 10  weeks 
[39]. We may, however, reach enough cells before 6 weeks 
leading to faster DSRT. Similarly, in patients where the 
recGSC expansion is slower, the time frame for cell cul-
turing can be expanded if the patient does not experi-
ence detrimental disease progression. The preclinical 
work-up can thus be adjusted for each patient for optimal 
arrangement.
In our DSRT we found patient-specific sensitivity to 
a wide range of FDA-approved drugs across different 
mechanistical classes, such as topoisomerase I inhibi-
tors (e.g. irinotecan, topotecan), EGFR-inhibitors (e.g. 
afatinib, erlotinib), and estrogen-receptor inhibitors 
(e.g. clomiphene, tamoxifen). Drugs from these classes 
have previously been investigated in clinical trials in 
GBM [40–46]. Overall, the effectiveness of these drugs 
appears very limited, but usually cases of partial and 
complete responses are reported. Such responses sug-
gest a heterogeneous pattern in drug sensitivity among 
patients in clinical trials. In support of clinical variation 
in drug sensitivities in GBM, the standard-of-care with 
TMZ display various effectiveness in patients. Sensitiv-
ity to TMZ can be predicted by methylation status of 
the MGMT-promoter [37], and tumors that are IDH-
mutated have better survival prospects following stand-
ard-of-care treatment [47]. Importantly, however, even 
in IDH wild-type tumors that have an unfavorable meth-
ylation profile (unmethylated MGMT promoter), some 
patients respond to TMZ treatment as demonstrated by 
the increased fraction of patients surviving over 2 years 
after the introduction of TMZ [48]. We have previously 
reported a heterogeneity of individual drug sensitiv-
ity in the treatment-naïve disease that mirrors clinical 
response patterns [13]. We hypothesize that the ex vivo 
DSRT model system may identify patients with tumor 
cells with the highest susceptibility to a drug or class of 
drugs. However, it is important to consider the limita-
tions ex vivo DSRT presents for drug discovery, as a very 
simplified model compared to the complex biological sys-
tem in a patient.
A major challenge in the treatment of tumors of the 
central nervous system (CNS) is the ability to reach ade-
quate concentrations of the drug within both the tumor 
and brain parenchyma across the blood–brain barrier 
(BBB). Penetrability and brain tissue concentrations 
of anticancer agents are for the vast majority of drugs, 
including the drugs in this study, unfortunately unknown 
[49, 50]. Selected compounds, such as alkylating agents 
(e.g. TMZ), nucleoside analogs (e.g. gemcitabine), topoi-
somerase inhibitors (e.g. topotecan), and a few kinase 
inhibitors (e.g. gefitinib, erlotinib), have been evalu-
ated for brain penetrability with varying results [50]. A 
major limitation in most human studies addressing BBB 
penetrability is the indirect measurement of brain con-
centrations levels using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) con-
centrations as a surrogate evaluation [50]. Thus, the true 
concentrations of brain parenchyma levels for the vast 
majority of anticancer drugs, including TMZ, are inade-
quately described. Evidence of brain penetrability of anti-
cancer drugs can, however, also be inferred from clinical 
trials reporting tumor responses in neuro oncological

disorders, such as in primary brain tumors or CNS 
metastases [43, 51, 52]. Examples include osimertinib 
in CNS metastases from non-small cell lung cancer [52] 
and trametinib in metastases from malignant melanoma 
[53]. The DSRT revealed selective drug responses of com-
pounds with evidence of brain penetrability (for instance 
afatinib [43], chloroquine [51], osimertinib [52], selinexor 
[54], trametinib [53], topotecan [41]) in all but one 
recGSC culture. Importantly, there are further emerging 
technologies to disrupt the BBB to enhance tissue con-
centrations of anticancer compounds for drugs with poor 
penetrability [55].
Intratumoral heterogeneity is a major challenge when 
applying targeted treatment strategies [56]. A single 
tumor biopsy involves a fraction of the total tumor vol-
ume, potentially not capturing more peripheral sub-
clones. To maximize clonal diversity, we utilized both 
tumor core sampling from several focal biopsies along 
with the ultrasonic aspirate generated during surgery. 
We utilized low passage cell cultures for DSRT and con-
firmed the tumorigenicity of tumor cells by orthotopi-
cally xenografting to immunodeficient mice. However, 
the study relies on in vitro evaluation of drug sensitivity, 
as the time frame for clinical translation is not feasible 
for in vivo studies. Furthermore, the DSRT investigates 
only sensitivities to single compounds. We acknowledge 
that single compound treatment seems of limited value in 
recGBM patients [56]. For investigation of drug sensitivi-
ties to several hundreds of anticancer drugs the require-
ment of total number of cells is extensive. Additional 
investigation of combination therapies would vastly 
increase requirements of cells along with the complexity 
of the system, and the major limiting factor in this trans-
lational protocol is the number of cells generated in cell 
culture. It is, however, possible to introduce combination 
treatments informed by DSRT although their combined 
effect not have been evaluated ex  vivo. For successful 
clinical translation of combinational therapies, the choice 
of therapy must be carefully undertaken, considering effi-
cacy, biodistribution and interactions.
Although the DSRT identified effective drugs available 
for clinical translation in all patients, the drug response 
patterns were remarkably heterogeneous across the 
recGSC culture cohort. For instance, T1516 and T1532 
displayed a high sensitivity to EGFR-inhibitors, whereas 
EGFR-inhibitors demonstrated very limited efficacy in the 
remaining tumors. EGFR is a commonly altered gene in 
GBM that has made it an attractive target for GBM ther-
apy. Results in clinical trials targeting EGFR alterations, 
even in highly selected patients, have unfortunately pre-
sented disappointing results [22]. Translating a genomic 
alteration into a relevant functional inhibition in a GBM 
cells [57] or glioma patients [24] is, however, complex. 
Results from the DSRT of both the untreated disease 
[13] and the recurrent tumors in this study, have shown 
consistency in the drug sensitivity patterns across a class 
of drugs in the individual tumor. Thus, the understand-
ing of biological traits involved in drug sensitivity, such 
as sensitivity to EGFR-inhibitors, could be further eluci-
dated by combining DSRT with molecular profiling of 
the individual tumor [28]. Such integration of genomic 
and functional data has stratified patients with acute 
myeloid leukemia into a functional taxonomy [27]. A 
similar approach of correlating genomic profiling to drug 
responses could strengthen the data presented in this 
study to more in-depth elucidate the biology underlying 
drug sensitivity. The aim of the current study was, how-
ever, to explore the feasibility of using functional profiling 
to develop a translational clinical protocol for individual-
ized treatment decisions in recGBM. To create functional 
taxonomies in GBM would require larger culture cohorts 
for more robust linkages. An important implication of 
such analyses would be the ability to create a database 
that relates drug sensitivity patterns to tumor genetics to 
identify potential therapies even when only genomic data 
are available. In turn, that could benefit the fraction of 
patients were the derived tumor biopsies not adequately 
proliferate to perform DSRT. It may also be of benefit to 
inform therapeutic strategies within a shorter time frame, 
as the current clinical protocol relies in the time-consum-
ing generation of individualized cell cultures.
Conclusions
In summary, we have established the pipeline for a trans-
lational clinical protocol targeting glioblastoma stem cells 
in recGBM utilizing automated drug sensitivity testing. 
We found an extensive intertumoral heterogeneity in 
sensitivity to anticancer drugs in recGBM that mirrors 
the clinical heterogeneity in drug sensitivity in GBM. 
This adds experimental evidence to why population-
based treatments of targeted therapies seem of limited 
value in a heterogeneous GBM population. In support for 
fast clinical translation, we found FDA-approved drugs 
displaying patient-specific activity in all recGBM cultures 
to guide individualized treatment decisions. We will fur-
ther utilize the protocol to translate ex vivo DSRT to the 
patient bedside for functional precision medicine, how-
ever, the protocol presented here is readily translatable to 
other cancers grown as tumorspheres.
