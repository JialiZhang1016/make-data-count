Lanthanide metallocenophanes are an intriguing class of organometallic complexes that feature rare six-
coordinate trigonal prismatic coordination environments of 4f elements with close intramolecular
proximity to transition metal ions. Herein, we present a systematic study of the structural and magnetic
properties of the ferrocenophanes, [LnFc3(THF)2Li2], of the late trivalent lanthanide ions (Ln ¼ Gd (1), Ho
(2), Er (3), Tm (4), Yb (5), Lu (6)). One major structural trend within this class of complexes is the
increasing diferrocenyl (Fc2) average twist angle with decreasing ionic radius (rion) of the central Ln ion,
resulting in the largest average Fc2 twist angles for the Lu3+ compound 6. Such high sensitivity of the
twist angle to changes in rion is unique to the here presented ferrocenophane complexes and likely due
to the large trigonal plane separation enforced by the ligand (>3.2 ˚A). This geometry also allows the non-
Kramers ion Ho3+ to exhibit slow magnetic relaxation in the absence of applied dc ﬁelds, rendering
compound 2 a rare example of a Ho-based single-molecule magnet (SMM) with barriers to
magnetization reversal (U) of 110–131 cm1. In contrast, compounds featuring Ln ions with prolate
electron density (3–5) don't show slow magnetization dynamics under the same conditions. The
observed trends in magnetic properties of 2–5 are supported by state-of-the-art ab initio calculations.
Finally, the magneto-structural relationship of the trigonal prismatic Ho-[1]ferrocenophane motif was
further investigated by axial ligand (THF in 2) exchange to yield [HoFc3(THF*)2Li2] (2-THF*) and
[HoFc3(py)2Li2] (2-py) motifs. We ﬁnd that larger average Fc2 twist angles (in 2-THF* and 2-py as
compared to in 2) result in faster magnetic relaxation times at a given temperature.
Introduction
Single-molecule magnets (SMMs) are discrete molecules having
a bistable magnetic ground state and a suﬃcient energy barrier
to magnetization reversal (U) which can lead to magnetic
hysteresis of purely molecular origin.1 SMMs represent the
smallest magnetic units that can be predictively modied with
synthetic chemistry. This renders SMMs highly attractive
research targets and highlights their potential utility as memory
components in future data processing and data storage
devices.2,3 In recent years, SMM design has largely involved
exploiting the magnetic anisotropy of a single metal ion with
a nely tuned ligand-eld environment. In contrast to the
traditional
“giant
spin”
approach
in
multinuclear
metal
complexes, designing SMMs with only a single paramagnetic
ion oﬀers the inherent advantage of simplied control of the
molecular magnetic anisotropy thereby allowing the magnetic
anisotropy of a single-ion to be maximized when it resides in an
optimal ligand coordination environment. Although signicant
progress is being reported for transition metal based mono-
nuclear SMMs,4–6 the majority of mononuclear SMMs aim to
exploit the intrinsically large single-ion magnetic anisotropy of
lanthanide ions which is due to their unquenched orbital
angular momentum and can lead to large magnetic moments,
especially in the latter half of the lanthanide series.7–11 Indeed,
lanthanide-based SMMs can be considered the best performing
SMMs
to-date,
especially
given
the
family
of
bis-
cyclopentadienyl lanthanide based cations, which led most
recently to molecules that exhibit magnetic hysteresis at
temperatures as high as 80 K.12–18

SMM performance is highly dependent on the geometry
enforced by the ligands surrounding the central ion. The ligand
coordination environment dictates the height of the energy
barrier to magnetization reversal (U) as well as inuences the
rate of quantum tunneling of the magnetization (QTM). For
lanthanide ions, the crystal eld potential acts as a perturbation
on the ground spin–orbit coupled, J, term (within the 2S+1LJ
coupling scheme) thereby determining the energy spacing
between ground and excited mj projections. In the optimal case
of spin relaxation occurring by an “over-the-barrier” Orbach
mechanism, the value of U will be proportional to the energy
gap of the ground and higher excited mj states.19,20 Molecular
symmetry also has direct bearing on the probability of QTM
between resonating mj projections. In some ligand eld geom-
etries transverse anisotropy terms will be included in the
crystal-eld Hamiltonian, thereby resulting in rapid QTM.21
With this in mind, understanding how various coordination
geometries aﬀect the magnetic anisotropy a Ln3+ ion is crucial
in the continued development of high-performance SMMs.
Many of the early examples of Ln-based SMMs featured multi-
dentate oxygen and/or nitrogen-based donor ligands which
naturally
resulted
in
SMMs
with
high
coordination
numbers.22–24 Of the “classical” Ln-SMM geometries, those
featuring axially elongated square antiprismatic (D4d),11,25–27
axially
compressed
square
antiprismatic
(D4d),28,29
or
compressed pentagonal bipyramidal (D5h)8,10,30,31 geometries
have been some of the most thoroughly investigated. More
recently, unique and lower coordinate structural motifs for Ln3+
compounds have been achieved by incorporating organic based
ligand scaﬀolds in SMM design.32–35 Modern organometallic
lanthanide chemistry has led to structurally and magnetically
important molecules such as the C8 symmetric lanthanide bis-
cyclooctatetraene, [Ln(COT)2],32–35 and the aforementioned
pseudo
and
strictly
linear
lanthanide
metallocenium,
[Ln(CpR)2]+1/0, complexes.
Lanthanide-based SMMs featuring six-coordinate ligand
eld geometries have been relatively unexplored in terms of
relating molecular geometry to the magnetic behavior of various
Ln3+ ions.9,36–40 This is most likely due to the relatively low
number of six-coordinate lanthanide complexes reported in the
literature as compared to those having higher coordination
numbers. Of the cubic and trigonal coordination environments
for six-coordinate lanthanide compounds, a trigonal ligand
eld is expected to be more suitable for SMM behavior.41 For
a Ln3+ ion residing in an idealized octahedral (Oh) environment,
slow magnetic relaxation is not expected, as the absence of the
second-order uniaxial anisotropy parameter, B0
2, from the
crystal-eld Hamiltonian should exclude the possibility of easy-
axis magnetic anisotropy.37,42,43 In contrast, an ideal trigonal
prismatic ligand eld (D3h) is predicted to stabilize a highly axial
mj ground state which could result in dynamic SMM behavior.
Indeed, recent reports have shown that a trigonal prismatic
geometry can support SMM behavior of Dy3+ and Tb3+
ions.36,37,39,40,44,45
Recently, our group utilized the organometallic chemistry of
the 1,1'- diferrocenyl (Fc2) metallo-ligand to synthesize the rst
Ln-[1]ferrocenophane
molecules,
[DyFc3(THF)2Li2]
and
[TbFc3(THF)2Li2], which feature a rare trigonal prismatic
arrangement of the six C1 carbons of the three dianionic Fc2
ligands.44,45
[DyFc3(THF)2Li2]
and
[TbFc3(THF)2Li2]
both
exhibit zero applied eld SMM behavior, with magnetic
anisotropy energy barriers of U ¼ 110 cm1 and U ¼ 274 cm1,
respectively. It is important to note that, to the best of our
knowledge, [TbFc3(THF)2Li2] features the largest zero-eld
magnetization energy barrier for a Ln–SMM with trigonal pris-
matic geometry. We recognized the [LnFc3(THF)2Li2] struc-
tural
motif
as
an
ideal
template
for
investigating
the
relationship between trigonal prismatic molecular geometry
and the magnetic anisotropy of the rest of the late Ln3+ ions.
The homoleptic coordination environment of [LnFc3(THF)2-
Li2] leads to higher symmetry compared to many of the
previously reported trigonal prismatic SMMs which contain
hetero-ligand donor atoms.
Herein, we report the synthesis, structural, and magnetic
characterization of the late Ln-[1]ferrocenophane complexes,
[Li(THF)4][LnFc3(THF)2Li2] (Ln ¼ Gd (1), Ho (2), Er (3), Tm (4),
Yb (5), Lu (6)). Of the compounds reported, the Ho-[1]
ferrocenophane compound [HoFc3(THF)2Li2] exhibits slow
magnetic relaxation in the absence of externally applied dc
elds which renders it a rare example of a non-Kramers Ho3+
SMM. Furthermore, we show how small distortions in the
trigonal prismatic ligand eld can lead to dramatic diﬀerences
in magnetization dynamics of the Ho-[1]ferrocenophane struc-
tural motif by synthesizing and magnetically characterizing the
pyridine (py) and 2-methyl THF (THF*) solvent adducts, [Li(py)4]
[HoFc3(py)2Li2] (2-py) and [Li(THF*)4][HoFc3(THF*)2Li2] (2-
THF*), respectively. Compounds 1–6 were also investigated by
ab initio computational methods which provided further insight
into the electronic structure of the Ln3+ ions residing in
a trigonal prismatic ligand eld geometry and their observed
static and dynamic magnetic properties.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
The late Ln-[1]ferrocenophane compounds [Li(THF)4][LnFc3-
Li(THF)2] (Ln ¼ Gd (1), Ho (2), Er (3), Tm (4), Yb (5), or Lu (6))
were prepared using a previously reported protocol via the salt
elimination reaction of anhydrous LnCl3 with excess Li6Fc3(-
TMEDA)2 (TMEDA ¼ tetramethylethylenediamine) in THF
(Fig. 1).44,45 Crude 1–6 are moderately soluble in Et2O which
allows for their facile separation from insoluble unreacted
starting
materials
and/or
biproducts.
Following
an
Et2O
extraction, crude 1–6 are recrystallized by slow diﬀusion of
pentane into their concentrated THF solutions, forming highly
air and moisture sensitive plate crystals of 1–6 in yields between
21–91% (based on Ln). The relatively high yield of the Tm-[1]
ferrocenophane compound 4 (91%), is an outlier and could be
a result of the Tm3+ six-coordinate ionic radii (0.880 ˚A) being the
optimal size for the [LnFc3]3 coordination environment.
Compound 1 can also be synthesized using anhydrous GdI3 but
in lower yields due to diﬃcult separation of (THF)xLiI or
[(TMEDA)2LiI]2 salt biproducts. Furthermore, depending on the
crystallinity of the LnCl3 salt, higher yields are obtained for

compounds 1–6 by forming the LnCl3(THF)x solvate prior to
addition to Li6Fc3(TMEDA)2.
The low temperature crystallization of the heaviest Yb- and
Lu-[1]ferrocenophane complexes 5 and 6 resulted in a mixture
of crystals with two habits: crystals of plate and rod-like shapes
could easily be identied. Analysis of both morphologies via
single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction (vide infra) determined the rod-
shaped crystals to contain structurally unique solvate of the
[LnFc3(THF)2Li2] anion (hereon denoted as 5Iso and 6Iso)
whereas the plate crystals are isostructural to 1–4. The crystal-
line structure of 5Iso and 6Iso diﬀers from 5 and 6 by means of an
extra THF solvate molecule located in the crystal lattice. The
formation of multiple solvates is unique to the preparation of 5
and 6 and could be a consequence of the ionic radii of Yb3+ and
Lu3+ being the smallest of the 4f series.
The diamagnetic nature of the 4f14 electron conguration of
the Lu3+ ion allows for facile analysis of the solution phase
structure of 6 and 6Iso by 1H-NMR spectroscopy. The 1H-NMR
spectrum of a mixture of 6 and 6Iso in THF-d8 shows nearly
identical chemical shis as the previously reported [Li(THF)4]
[YFc3(THF)2Li2] compound, with two downeld resonances at
4.05 ppm and 4.09 ppm corresponding to the two sets
magnetically inequivalent protons of the diferrocenyl ligands
(Fig. 1). The presence of only two resonances corresponding to
the Fc2 ligand protons suggest the solution phase structures of
6 and 6Iso are similar on the NMR measurement timescale.
Once crystalized, compounds 1–6 are highly insoluble in
nonpolar alkanes and ethers such as pentane, diethyl ether, and
1,4-dioxane as well as weakly or non-coordinating polar
solvents, such as diuorobenzene. In contrast, 1–6 are highly
soluble in polar coordinating solvents such as THF, 2-methyl
THF (THF*) and pyridine (py). The solubility properties of 1–6
suggest that dissolution could involve coordination of the polar
coordinating solvent to the Li+ ions within the lattice of 1–6.
Therefore, we hypothesized that various solvent adducts of the
general formula [Li(sol)x][LnFc3(sol)2Li2], where sol is a polar
coordinating
solvent,
could
be
synthesized.
Indeed,
the
synthesis of the Ho-[1]ferrocenophane solvent adducts, [Li(py)4]
[HoFc3(py)2Li2] (2-py) and [Li(THF*)4][HoFc3(THF*)2Li2] (2-
THF*), was achieved by slow diﬀusion of pentanes into pyridine
and 2-methyl THF solutions of [Li(THF)4][HoFc3(THF)2Li2],
respectively. Single crystal X-ray diﬀraction studies of 2-py and
2-THF* (vide infra) reveal that for 2-py all coordinated THF
molecules have been replaced by pyridine molecules. On the
other hand, the structure of 2-THF* indicates signicant
disorder in the THF* solvate molecules which could suggest
a statistical mixture of [Li–THF]+ and [Li–THF*]+ units within
the same crystal lattice.
Solid state structural determination
Solid state structures of 1–6, 5Iso, and 6Iso. The solid-state
structures of compounds 1–6 were determined via single-
crystal X-ray diﬀraction and are isostructural to the previously
reported Tb3+ and Dy3+ congeners. All six compounds crystalize
in the monoclinic space group P21/c inside a highly anisotropic
unit cell (a,c < 15 ˚A and b > 60 ˚A). The molecular structure of 1–6
features a single Ln3+ ion accommodated by three dianionic
ferrocenyl ligands (Fc2) that are arranged in a distorted C3
fashion around the central Ln3+ ion (Fig. 2). The six-coordinate
geometry of each Ln-[1]ferrocenophane molecule is most
accurately described as distorted trigonal prismatic with the
principal C3 axis passing through the centroids of the three
diferrocenyl C1-carbons, forming a tri-anionic “pocket” above
and below the equatorial plane of the molecule. Each charged
ligand “pocket” is stabilized by a [Li–THF]+ moiety which
completes the inner-sphere, [LnFc3(THF)2Li2], monoanionic
complex. The molecular charge is balanced by a [Li(THF)4]+ unit
residing in the outer-sphere.
The unit cells of 1–6 contain two structurally unique Ln-[1]
ferrocenophane molecules per asymmetric unit (Ln(1) and
Ln(2)), each having similar bonding parameters (Table 1).
Across the series the average Ln–C bond distances decrease

from 2.572[8] ˚A and 2.569[8] ˚A for 1 (Gd(1) and Gd(2), respec-
tively) to 2.501[11] ˚A and 2.497[11] ˚A for compound 6 (Lu(1) and
Lu(2), respectively). The observed decrease in Ln–C bond
distance with increase in atomic number is most likely due to
the increased Lewis acidity and/or the smaller ionic radii of the
heaviest Ln3+ ions. The intramolecular Ln/Fe distances show
a more subtle change across the period decreasing from 3.2281
[12] ˚A and 3.2300[12] ˚A for 1 (Gd(1) and Gd(2), respectively) to
3.2108[16] ˚A and 3.2068[16] ˚A for 6 (Lu(1) and Lu(2), respec-
tively). The average Ln/Fe distances between 3.2300[12] to
3.2068[16] ˚A are some of the closest reported for any hetero-
metallic Ln–Fe species, but lie just outside the sum of the
covalent radii of the Fe2+ and Ln3+ ions.46
Despite miniscule diﬀerences in the average bonding
parameters between the distinct Ln(1) and Ln(2) molecules
within each unit cell of 1–6, each molecule shows signicant
diﬀerences of the average Fc2 ligand twist angle. Here, the
ligand twist angle is dened by the torsion of the two C1 donor
atoms of a single diferrocenyl ligand with respect to the
centroids (previously described) of the trianionic pockets
located above and below equatorial plane of the molecule (see
Fig. 3 leinset). A ligand twist angle greater than 0 would
indicate distortion of the molecular geometry away from ideal
trigonal prismatic geometry. For the Ho(1) and Ho(2) molecules
of compound 2, the average ligand twist angles are 10.67 and
12.67, respectively. It is important to note here that such small
diﬀerences in the ligand eld geometry can greatly inuence the
spectroscopic and magnetic characteristics of a Ln3+ ion.47,48
Considering the Ln(2) molecules across the heavy lanthanide
series, the average diferrocenyl twist angle has an inversely
proportional relationship to the 6-coordinate ionic radius of the
Ln3+ ion, increasing from 9.64 for Gd(2) (rGd3+ ¼ 0.938 ˚A) to

18.56 for Lu(2) (rLu3+ ¼ 0.861 ˚A). The Ln(1) molecules across the
period show an identical trend. This inverse relationship
between twist angle and ionic radius can be explained by the
increased steric hindrance of the [Fc3]6 ligand eld as the Ln3+
ionic radius decreases and the needed ‘twist’ of the Fc2 ligands
to stabilize the smaller Ln3+ center.
For the trigonal prismatic geometry, comparison of the
distance, d, between eclipsed ligand donor atoms or pseudo
eclipsed donors (in the case of a ligand twist angle > 0) for
a series of similar complexes can indicate the degree of ligand
rigidity as well as the axiality trigonal ligand eld of the central
Ln3+ ion. In the case of [LnFc3(THF)2Li2], d would be the
distance between the two C1 donors of a single Fc2 ligand (see
Fig. 3 right inset) and is proportional to the C–Ln–C bite angle.
For the Ln(2) molecules of 1–6, the largest average d value of the
three Fc2 ligands is 3.336 ˚A for 1 which features the largest
Gd3+ ion. Upon moving across the row, the average C1/C1
distance of the Fc2 ligand decreases to a value of 3.249 ˚A for 6
(Fig. 3 right). The decrease in average Fc2 C1/C1 distance
with decrease in Ln3+ ionic radii is accompanied by a decrease
in the average C1–Fe–C1 angle of the Fc2 ligand from 104.9[3]
for the Gd(2) in 1 to 102.1[1] for Lu(2) in 6.
In order to gain a more comprehensive picture of the
geometric trends in trigonal prismatic lanthanide compounds,
we compared the average ligand twist angle and d values of 1–6
with the same parameters of selected previously reported
trigonal prismatic lanthanide complexes [(LCO)Ln(N(SiMe3)2)2]

borate; Ln ¼ Tb3+, Dy3+, Y3+, Ho3+, or Er3+)40 (Fig. 3). Of the
compared complexes, 1–6, Ln(BpMe2)3, Ln(BpMe), and Ln(BcMe)3
feature a homo-ligand donor environment around the central
Ln3+ ions. To this end, for the tris-pyrazolyl and tris-imidazolyl
borate complexes, the possibility of HB–H/Ln agostic inter-
actions complicate a complete structural comparison with these
compounds. Upon inspection of Fig. 3 (Le), it is apparent that
the Ln-[1]ferrocenophane complexes, 1–6, feature the greatest
susceptibility of ligand twist angle with a change in ionic radius.
Furthermore, in contrast to the Ln-[1]ferrocenophane series,
[(LCO)Ln(N(SiMe3)2)2],
[Ln(L)3],
Ln(BpMe2)3,
Ln(BpMe)3,
and
Ln(BcMe)3 feature an increase of the average ligand twist angle
with Ln3+ ionic radius or do not show a signicant correlation at
all (in the case of the tris–borate complexes).
In general, all ve sets of compared trigonal prismatic
lanthanide complexes exhibit an increase in the average
eclipsed/pseudo eclipsed ligand donor distanced, with an
increase in Ln3+ ionic radii (Fig. 3, right). Despite this similar
trend, the Ln-[1]ferrocenophane complexes, 1–6, feature the
largest average d values of the compared complexes. This
distinction is signicant and could suggest the Fc2 donor
ligands of 1–6 might interact more strongly with f-orbitals of z-
character, which in turn would have a signicant inuence of
the magnetism of these compounds.
The single-crystal X-ray structures for the Yb3+ and Lu3+
solvates, 5Iso and 6Iso, were solved in the monoclinic space
group Ia and Cc, respectively, inside a unit cell with lengths
between 20–33 ˚A. Though solved in diﬀerent space groups, 5Iso
and 6Iso are most likely isostructural given the almost identical
unit cell volumes of 16 344(3) ˚A3 (for 5Iso) and 16 419(4) ˚A3 (for
6Iso) (see ESI† for details). Both 5Iso and 6Iso contain three
structurally unique [Li(THF)4][LnFc3(THF)2Li2] molecules per
unit cell along with an uncoordinated THF lattice solvate per
Ln-[1]ferrocenophane
molecule
which
is
not
present
in
compounds 5 and 6 (Fig. 4). The average Ln–C and Ln/Fe
distances for the three independent molecules of 5Iso and 6Iso
are close to the corresponding distances for the two indepen-
dent molecules of compound 5 and 6, respectively (Table S12†).
To this end, the average Fc2 twist angles vary signicantly
between corresponding solvates. The most distorted molecules
of the THF solvated molecules, 5Iso and 6Iso, exhibit a 3.3 and
a 2.4 increase in twist angle when compared to the most highly
distorted molecules of 5 and 6, respectively. This result is
signicant as it highlights how crystal packing eﬀects can
greatly inuence the geometry of the inner coordination sphere
of the individual molecules in the solid state.

2-THF* and 2-py feature a [HoFc3(sol)2Li2] core similar to that

of compound 2 except with displaced THF molecules of the [Li–
THF]+ units with THF* (for 2-THF*) or pyridine (for 2-py)
(Fig. 5). Substitution of inner sphere THF molecules with THF*
or pyridine do not signicantly change the Ho–C bond
distances which are within error equal to those of compound 2
(Table S13†). To this end, the Ho/Fe distances decrease from
3.229[8] and 3.221[13] for Ho(1) and Ho(2) in 2 to 3.2098[13] ˚A
for 2-THF* to 3.1970[15] ˚A and 3.1617[16] ˚A for Ho(1)-py and
Ho(2)-py in 2-py. In contrast to compound 2, the unit cell of 2-
THF* contains only a single structurally unique Ho3+ site.
Signicant disorder of the THF* molecules was observed in the
X-ray structure 2-THF* which is likely a result of multiple
orientations of the coordinated THF* molecule. It should also
be noted that the observed disorder could also suggest incom-
plete displacement of the THF molecules upon dissolution of
compound 2 in THF*. To this end, the atoms of the [HoFc3Li2]
core do not show signs of disorder which might have been ex-
pected considering the diﬀering donor strengths of the THF
and THF*. Similar to 2, the unit cell of 2-py features two
structurally unique Ho3+ sites. Only positional disorder of the
inner sphere pyridine solvate molecules of the [Li–py]+ unit is
observed in the X-ray structure which suggest full displacement
of the THF molecules upon dissolution of 2 in pyridine.
Though little variation is observed in the interatomic Ho–C
distances between 2, 2-THF*, and 2-py, the average Fc2 twist
angle varies signicantly upon changing the identity of the axial
[Li-sol]+ moiety. Considering the most highly distorted mole-
cule within each of the unit cells, the average Fc2 twist angle
increases from 12.67 (for 2), to 16.52 (for 2-THF*), to 23.69
(for 2-py) (Fig. 6). The average Fc2 twist angle for 2-py repre-
sents the largest of any of the Ln-[1]ferrocenophane compounds
reported herein. As shown previously with the structural varia-
tion between the corresponding solvates of the Yb- and Lu-[1]
ferrocenophane complexes, crystal packing can greatly inu-
ence the geometry of the [LnFc3(THF)2Li2] inner coordination
sphere. The variation in the crystal packing for 2, 2-THF*, and 2-
py is also emphasized by the changes in the closest intermo-
lecular distances between Ho3+ sites of 10.586 ˚A (for 2), 11.069 ˚A
(for 2-THF*), and 8.941 ˚A (for 2-py) (Table S14†). The varying
electronic donor strengths of the solvent molecules likely plays
an additional role in the geometric variation between 2, 2-THF*,
and 2-py though similar Li–C and Li/Ho interatomic distance
between the molecules precludes any further discussion here.
Magnetic properties
Static magnetic properties of [Li(THF)4][LnFc3(THF)2Li2] (1–
5/5Iso). The static magnetic properties of compounds 1–5 were
investigated by measuring the temperature dependence of the
molar magnetic susceptibility under an external 0.1 T magnetic
eld across the 300–2 K temperature range (Fig. 7). The cMT
(300 K) values for 2–5 are 14.39 emu K mol1 (2), 11.71 emu K
mol1 (3), 7.00 emu K mol1 (4), and 2.50 emu K mol1 (5) and
correspond nicely to the expected values of 14.07 emu K mol1,

11.48 emu K mol1, 7.15 emu K mol1, and 2.57 emu K mol1
for a single non-interacting Ho3+ (5I8; S ¼ 2, L ¼ 6; gJ ¼ 5/4), Er3+
(4I15/2; S ¼ 3/2, L ¼ 6; gJ ¼ 6/5), Tm3+ (3H6; S ¼ 1, L ¼ 5; gJ ¼ 7/6),
and Yb3+ (2F7/2; S ¼ 1/2, L ¼ 3; gJ ¼ 8/7) ions, respectively. The
cMT (300 K) value of 1 is 8.84 emu K mol1 and is slightly higher
than the expected value of 7.88 emu K mol1 for a non-
interacting Gd3+ ion (8S7/2; S ¼ 7/2, L ¼ 0; gJ ¼ 2). This
discrepancy could be due to small weighing errors or a preferred
orientation
of
the
Gd-[1]ferrocenophane
plate
crystallites
aligning with the external eld, resulting in a slight increase of
the magnetic moment. Upon cooling, the cMT of 1 remains
constant across the entire temperature range suggesting an
isolated S ¼ 7/2 ground state and weak intermolecular magnetic
interactions between neighboring molecules in the crystal
lattice. In contrast, deviation from typical Curie–Weiss behavior
is observed for 2–5. For the Ho3+ and Yb3+ compounds 2 and 5/
5Iso, the cMT value remains nearly constant until ca. 100 K
where a gradual decrease is observed to minimum values of 9.77
emu K mol1 (for 2) and 0.63 emu K mol1 (for 5) at 2.5 K and 2
K, respectively. A steeper cMT decline at low temperatures is
observed for 3, where a drop from 11.08 emu K mol1 to 5.86
emu K mol1 occurs between 100–2 K. The most pronounced
temperature dependent behavior is observed for the Tm3+
compound 4 which exhibits a nearly linear decrease of cMT with
temperature beginning at 30 K to a minimum value of 0.23 emu
K mol1 at 2 K. The low temperature decline of the cMT value
observed for 2–5 is typical for mono-metallic species containing
a single anisotropic Ln3+ ion and is commonly attributed to the
depopulation of the crystal eld states, very weak intermolec-
ular antiferromagnetic interactions, and/or blocking of the
magnetization. However, the precipitous drop of the cMT value
of 4 suggest population of a non-magnetic ground state at the
lowest temperatures. This observation is further supported by
ab initio calculations which predicts a stabilization of a mj ¼
0 ground state of the Tm3+ ion within the crystal eld sublevels
(vide infra).
The static magnetic behavior of 1–5 was further investigated
by measuring the eld dependence of the magnetization
between 2–8 K (Fig. S12†). For compounds 2–5, the 2 K
magnetization values at the 7 T eld limit are 5.11 mB (for 2),
6.16 mB (for 3), 1.28 mB (for 4), and 1.36 mB (for 5), respectively,
and are much lower than the expected single ion Ms values of 10
mB (for Ho3+), 9 mB (for Er3+), 7 mB (for Tm3+), and 4 mB (for Yb3+).
This discrepancy suggests anisotropy of the lowest energy J

multiplets of the respective Ln3+ ion which results in non-
degenerate mj microstates. The inherent magnetic anisotropy
of 2–5 is further supported by the non-superposition of the M vs.
H/T curves between 2–8 K (Fig. S13†). For compound 1, the 2 K
magnetization curve reaches a maximum value of 7.78 mB at 7 T
which corresponds nicely to the expected value of 7 mB for
a single Gd3+ ion. This data along with the superposition of the
M vs. H/T curves between 2–8 K supports the isotropic nature of
an isolated S ¼ 7/2 ground state in 1.
Dynamic magnetic properties of [Li(THF)4][HoFc3(THF)2Li2]
(2). Examples of mononuclear Ho-based molecules that display
dynamic magnetic behavior are relatively sparse in the litera-
ture.28,52–57 Even rarer are holmium SMMs which are supported
by purely organic based ligand eld environments.58,59 The
rarity of Ho-based SMMs is likely due to Ho3+ being a non-
Kramers
ion,
which
does
not
necessitate
a
degenerate
magnetic ground state as in Dy3+, Er3+, or Yb3+ based molecules.
Furthermore, the 100% natural abundance of the I ¼ 7/2 165Ho
nuclei facilitates strong nuclear hyperne interactions which
can cause fast QTM.60
A common characteristic among the few reported Ho-based
SMMs is a highly symmetric axial ligand eld environment
which stabilizes a suitably anisotropic mj ground state of the
oblate Ho3+ ion. Previous ab initio studies of the Dy- and Tb-[1]
ferrocenophane compounds suggest the three diferrocenyl
ligands of [LnFc3(THF)2Li2] promote a largely axial ligand eld
that stabilizes large mj ground states in the oblate Dy3+ and Tb3+
ions. Based on these results, we hypothesized that the trigonal
prismatic [Fc3]6 ligand eld could be suitable to promote
a highly anisotropic ground state in the oblate Ho3+ ion
resulting in SMM behavior in the [HoFc3(THF)2Li2] complex.
In order to probe the SMM behavior in 2, the variable temper-
ature alternating current (ac) magnetic susceptibility was
measured in the absence of an external magnetic eld. The
presence of a broad temperature dependent signal in the molar
out-of-phase component ðc
00
MÞ of the ac magnetic susceptibility
versus frequency plot indicates 2 is indeed a rare example of zero
applied eld Ho3+ SMM (Fig. 8a). Between 2–5 K, the c
00
M signal
maximum is slightly temperature dependent, shiing to higher
frequencies upon increasing the temperature. This slight vari-
ation of the c
00
M maximum with temperature is signicant as it
suggests contributions to the spin relaxation from thermally
assisted Raman and/or Orbach mechanisms even at the lowest
temperatures. Increasing the temperature above 5 K, the c
00
M
maximum
becomes
increasingly
temperature
dependent,
moving outside the 1000 Hz frequency limit at 11 K.
The exceptionally broad nature of the c
00
M signal of 2 indicates
multiple spin relaxation processes are occurring at similar ac
frequencies.61 It is likely that this observation is predominately
a result of the two structurally unique Ho(1) and Ho(2) sites in
the solid state structure of 2 having slightly diﬀerent magneti-
zation dynamics. However, the complexity of the spin dynamics
of Ln–SMMs has recently been emphasized and the simulta-
neous contribution from Raman, Orbach, and QTM processes
to the spin relaxation of a single Ho3+ ion cannot be excluded.62
The molar in-phase ðc

of the ac magnetic susceptibility of 2 were used to construct

(1)
(Cole–Cole parameters dened in ESI†). Eqn (1) represents
the sum of two modied Debye functions and describes two
magnetic relaxation processes each having a characteristic
magnetic relaxation time, s1 and s2, at each temperature.
Using the extracted Cole–Cole parameters at each tempera-
ture, a “slow” (SR) and a “fast” (FR) relaxation process could be
resolved in the c
00
M versus frequency plot of 2, where the 2 K c
00
M
signal maxima of SR and FR appear at 11.6 and 262.5 Hz,
respectively (Fig. 8b and c). For FR, the shorter 2 K magnetic
relaxation time of s2 ¼ 0.00058 s (as compared to s1 ¼ 0.014 s for
SR) and the temperature independence of the c
00
M signal
maximum suggests signicant contribution of QTM to the spin
relaxation. The origin of the increased QTM contribution for FR
is most likely due to transverse elds arising from intermolec-
ular interactions between neighboring spin centers or nuclear
hyperne interactions.
To further investigate the origin of QTM in 2, the
magnetically dilute species, [Li(THF)4][Y0.94Ho0.06Fc3(THF)2-
Li2] (2-dilute), was prepared and magnetically characterized.
Similar to 2, the zero-eld ac magnetic susceptibility data of 2-
dilute
provides
evidence
of
multiple
spin
relaxation
processes, with two distinct maxima appearing at 1.2 Hz and
107.8 Hz in the c
00
M vs. Frequency plot at 2 K (Fig. 8d). As
previously described, a FR and SR process were resolved by
tting the ac magnetic susceptibility of 2-dilute with eqn (1)
(Fig. 8e amd f). The 2 K magnetic relaxation times of s1 ¼
0.14 s (for SR) and s2 ¼ 0.0011 s (for FR) are at least half of an
order of magnitude longer than the corresponding SR and FR
processes for non-dilute 2 at the same temperature. This
result
is
signicant
as
it
suggests
that
intermolecular
magnetic interactions are playing a non-negligible role in the
low temperature magnetization dynamics of compound 2. To
this end, the c

low temperatures is still only marginally temperature depen-
dent which might indicate intramolecular phenomenon such
as nuclear hyperne interactions are contributing to the QTM
of 2.
QTM pathways can also be mitigated by creating a eld bias
upon the application of an external magnetic eld which
breaks the degeneracy of the mj crystal eld states thereby
lowering the probability of spin relaxation through tunneling
mechanisms. The temperature dependence of the ac magnetic
susceptibility of compound 2 was measured under an optimal
0.35 T magnetic eld (Fig. S31†) from 1.8–11 K. In an external
eld, the 2 K c
00
M signal of 2@0.35T remains broad but shows
a signicant shiof the maximum to lower frequencies sug-
gesting an increase in the magnetic relaxation time (Fig. 9).
Heating the sample to 5 K results in a high frequency shiof
the c
00
M maximum as well as an increase in the magnitude of
the signal. Interestingly, heating past 5 K results in an
increase in symmetry of the c
00
M signal and indicates the spin
dynamics of 2@0.35T is shiing towards a single relaxation
process at higher temperatures. The 2@0.35T magnetic
relaxation time for the SR process at 2 K of s1 ¼ 0.13 s
(determined using eqn (1)) is close to the corresponding SR
process relaxation time for 2-dilute at the same temperature.
This observation suggests application of an external eld and
magnetic dilution have similar eﬀects on the magnetization
dynamics of 2, at least when considering only the SR process.
The magnetic relaxation times extracted using eqn (1) were
used to construct Arrhenius plots (ln(s) vs. 1/T) for each of the

In the case of 2 and 2-dilute where H ¼ 0 T, the direct term
AHn1T becomes zero and was therefore disregarded. For
2@0.35T, the direct term A ¼ 114 S1 T2 K1 was determined
by tting the eld dependence of the magnetic relaxation time
(Fig. S31†). Due to the complicated nature of the 2@0.35T ac
magnetic susceptibility, the low temperature regime (1.8–2.5 K)
could not be t accurately and only the higher temperature
regime (3–11 K) of the SR process was considered in the
Arrhenius tting procedure. The best t parameters obtained
using this tting procedure for 2, 2-dilute, and 2@0.35T are
given in Table 2. It is important to note that the tting param-
eters for the FR process of 2 and 2-dilute should only be
considered as rough estimates, as the c
00
M maximum of the
resolved signal lies outside of the measured frequency range at
higher temperatures. For all ts, the obtained Raman coeﬃ-
cients (n2) are close to the expected range of n2 ¼ 5–7 for a non-
Kramers ion.63 For the FR and SR processes of 2, 2-dilute, and

Dynamic magnetic properties of [HoFc3(py)2Li2] (2-py) and
[HoFc3(THF*)2Li2]
(2-THF*).
Small
perturbations
in
the
crystal-eld environment can greatly inuence the electronic
structure and thus the magnetization dynamics of lanthanide-
based molecules. In order to explore how small distortions in
the trigonal prismatic [Fc3]6 ligand eld eﬀects the SMM
properties of the Ho-[1]ferrocenophane compound, [HoFc3(-
THF)2Li2], the static and dynamic magnetic properties of the
pyridine
solvated
complex,
[HoFc3(py)2Li2]
(2-py)
were
explored.
The static magnetic behavior of 2-py is nearly identical to
that of compound 2 (Fig. S11†). Interestingly, the dynamic
magnetic properties of 2-py are markedly diﬀerent from that
of compound 2 (Fig. 11). Compound 2-py features extremely
broad signals in the c
00
M vs. frequency plot but does not
feature any discernable signal maxima within the measured
1–1000 Hz frequency range. This qualitative observation
readily suggests that the magnetic relaxation times for the
more geometrically distorted Ho-[1]ferrocenophane mole-
cules in 2-py, are much faster than the magnetic relaxation
times observed for the Ho-[1]ferrocenophane molecules in 2,
which features a low frequency c
00
M signal maximum at
18.2 Hz at 2 K. Upon increasing the temperature above 2 K,
the c
00
M signal of 2-py moves out of the high frequency limit
and almost completely disappears at 10 K. Out-of-phase
signals at only the highest frequencies without signal
maxima within the frequency range could suggest QTM is
a major contributor to the spin relaxation in 2-py. Although
the magnetic relaxation of 2-py is too fast to allow the
extraction of an energy barrier of magnetization reversal, the
presented data suggests that the deviation from idealized
trigonal prismatic geometry (increase in torsion angle)
increases relaxation times.

Dynamic magnetic properties of [LnFc3(THF)2Li2] (Ln ¼
Er3+ (3), Tm3+ (4), and Yb3+ (5)). For the Er3+, Tm3+, and Yb3+
compounds 3, 4, and 5 respectively, no appreciable signal is
observed in the c
00
M vs. Frequency plot in the absence of an
external magnetic eld. This result is not surprising as the axial
[LnFc3]3 ligand eld likely destabilizes the largest mj ¼ 15/2,
6, and 7/2 projections of the prolate Er3+, Tm3+, and Yb3+
ions, respectively. These results are also consistent with dc
magnetization data for the Tm3+ compounds, 4, which suggest
the lowest energy mj ¼ 0 ground state for 4.
For the Yb3+ compound 5/5Iso, application of an optimal 0.2
T external magnetic eld results in slow magnetic relaxation
behavior as evidenced by a narrow temperature dependent
signal in c
00
M vs. Frequency plot (Fig. 12a). Between 1.8–2 K, the
magnitude of the c
00
M signal increases which could suggest that
the spin relaxation is occurring through multiple relaxation
mechanisms at the lowest temperatures and subsequently
shiing towards a single mechanism upon heating. Heating
results in an increased temperature dependence of the c
00
M
single maximum which eventually moves outside of the
measured frequency range at 3.5 K.
Using the ac magnetic susceptibility of compound 5/5Iso,
Cole–Cole curves were constructed and were tted using general
Debye equation which considers only one spin relaxation
process. The extracted magnetic relaxation times were then
used to construct an Arrhenius plot between 1.8–3.5 K
(Fig. 12b). Analyzing the Arrhenius plot for compound 5 shows
the magnetic relaxation times for 5 are temperature dependent
across the full temperature range suggesting low contribution
from quantum tunneling processes. Between 2.5–3.5 K, the
magnetic relaxation times become increasingly temperature
dependent but never become fully linear on the logarithmic
scale. This indicates signicant contributions to the spin
relaxation from second-order Raman and/or direct processes
even at the highest temperature regime. Similar behavior has
been observed in the trigonal Yb3+ SMM, Yb[trensal], where it
was reported that considering solely an Orbach relaxation
mechanism was insuﬃcient in describing the anisotropy energy
barrier of the system.64 As previously described, the Arrhenius
plot for 5/5Iso was t using eqn (2). The direct exponent, n1, was
held constant at n1 ¼ 4 and the direct term, A, was allowed to
freely rene along with the other Arrhenius parameters due to
the inability in acquiring a reasonable t of the s vs. H plot for
compound 5/5Iso (Fig. S49†). Using this tting procedure, values
of Arrhenius parameters of A ¼ 0.304 S1 T2 K1, sQTM ¼
0.00269 s, C ¼ 0.00812 s1 K4,25 n2 ¼ 4.25, so ¼ 9.04  105 s,
and U ¼ 6 cm1 were obtained.

Electronic structure determination of compounds 1–5
To further investigate the electronic structure of the late
lanthanide ions in the trigonal prismatic geometry and the
observed magnetic properties of 2–5, multi-congurational ab
initio calculations were performed using the Molcas 8.2 package
within the CASSCF/SO-RASSI and XMS-CASPT2/SO-RASSI level
of theory.65 For the two independent Ln(1) and Ln(2) molecules
of 2–5, there are only small diﬀerences of the energies of the
spin–orbit states and corresponding g-tensors, therefore only
the results obtained for Ln(1) within the XMS-CASPT2 level of
theory will be discussed here (Tables S21–S27†) (Table 3).
The ground state electronic structures for 2–5 are shown in
Fig. 13. The axial nature of the trigonal prismatic ligand eld is
expected to be least suitable for stabilizing the largest mj
projections in the latest prolate lanthanide ions (Er3+, Tm3+, and
Yb3+). The Er-[1]ferrocenophane compound, 3, shows highly
mixed ground doublets containing mj ¼ 1/2 (24%), 5/2
(23%), and 7/2 (18.7%) character. The rst and second
excited mj states for 3 reside only 28 cm1 and 52 cm1 above
the ground doublets which contributes to the highly mixed mj
composition and large transverse g-tensors (gx and gy) of 3
(Table 4). These factors contribute to the lack of axial magnetic
anisotropy of the ground state and explain the lack of SMM
behavior for 3. For compound 4, a non-magnetic, mj ¼ 0, ground
state is observed and therefore it does not exhibit any magnetic
anisotropy. This corresponds well with the direct current
magnetic susceptibility data in which the molar magnetic
susceptibility temperature product drops to near zero at 2 K.
The
composition
of
the
ground
doublet
of
the
Yb-[1]
ferrocenophane compound, 5, is mostly mj ¼ 7/2 (51%) and
3/2 (11%) character and exhibits large transversal g-tensors
which leads to a magnetic anisotropy axis which is nearly
perpendicular to the principal C3 axis of the [LnFc3(THF)2Li2]
motif. Therefore, the lack of SMM behavior of 5 in the absence
of an external magnetic eld is not surprising as fast spin
relaxation through QTM processes is expected. To this end, the
observed slow relaxation under an applied magnetic eld
suggests that the ground mj ¼ 7/2 doublet becomes purer
under an applied eld and therefore QTM is at least partially
shut down. For 5, the rst excited mj state lies 121 cm1 above
the ground doublet, therefore if the spin relaxation of 5 under
an applied eld proceeds via an Orbach mechanism through
the rst excited state, and energy barrier 120 cm1 is likely to
be observed under an applied magnetic eld. The experimen-
tally extracted spin reversal barrier of 6 cm1 is signicantly
lower than the energy gap between the ground and rst excited
state and suggest that spin relaxation proceeds mainly through
a second-order Raman and/or direct mechanism.
For the Ho-[1]ferrocenophane compound, 2, an almost pure
mj ¼ 7 ground state is observed and is well stabilized from the
rst and second excited states by 137 cm1 and 228 cm1,
respectively. The highly anisotropic ground state leads to an
axial magnetic moment vector that resides along the principal
{LnFc3} C3 axis explaining the observed SMM behavior of 2. The
magnetic blocking barrier of the Ho(2) molecule of 2 was
further investigated by following the methodology described in
ref. 66 (Fig. 14). The tunneling gaps between the ground
doublets are small which suggests ground state QTM is
minimal. Spin relaxation is expected to proceed through the
rst excited state given the large tunneling gap of 0.77 cm1.
The energy of the rst excited state (137 cm1) corresponds
remarkably well with the experimentally extracted energy
barriers of 2, 2-dilute, and 2@0.35T (110–131 cm1).
Conclusions
We present a detailed analysis of trends in structure and
magnetic properties of the remaining members of the family of
late Ln-[1]ferrocenophane complexes which all feature exclu-
sively carbon-donors coordinated to trigonal prismatic lantha-
nide ions. The observed trend of increasing Fc2 twist angle
with decreasing ionic radii of the Ln3+ ions can be rationalized
by simple geometric arguments and considering the structural
rigidity of the Fc2 units. The Ho3+ complex 2 exhibits slow
magnetic relaxation in the absence of applied dc elds,
rendering it a rare example of a Ho3+-based SMM. Structural

modication of the approximate trigonal prismatic coordina-
tion environment can be achieved remotely via substitution of
coordinating solvent molecules to the terminating Li+ ions.
Specically, an increase in Fc2 twist angle and deviation from
ideal trigonal prismatic geometry is observed in the series 2, 2-
THF*, and 2-py which is accompanied by a decrease in magnetic
relaxation times at a given temperature for the pyridine solvated
molecule 2-py. Taken together our results emphasize the
sensitivity of the magnetic structure of Ln3+ ions in trigonal
prismatic coordination environments to the twist angle and
provide design guidelines for six-coordinate SMMs.
Experimental section
General materials and methods
All syntheses and magnetic sample preparation were carried out
under the rigorous exclusion of air and moisture using an ultra-
high purity Ar lled glovebox (Vigor) in which the O2 and H2O
levels were generally held under 2 ppm and 0.1 ppm, respec-
tively. Tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, hexanes, and n-pentane
were all dried and deoxygenated using a solvent purication
system (JC Meyer or Innovative Technologies SPS) and were
stored over molecular sieves (3a, 8 to 12 mesh) prior to use.
Pyridine was dried by stirring over CaH2 for 24 hours and
deoxygenated using freeze–pump–thaw methods. Prior to use 2-
methyl tetrahydrofuran (THF*) was passed through a basic
alumina column to remove the butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT)
stabilizer. Stabilizer free THF* was deoxygenated by purging N2
gas through the solvent and was dried by reuxing over Na/
benzophenone. Anhydrous THF* and pyridine were stored
over molecular sieves (3a, 8 to 12 mesh). Anhydrous GdCl3,
HoCl3, and ErCl3 were received as a generous gifrom Dr
Timothy Hughbanks. Anhydrous TmCl3 (Millipore Sigma),
YbCl3 (Alfa Aesar), and LuCl3 (Alfa Aesar) were purchased from
commercial sources and were used as received. Li6(Fe(h5-C5-
H4)2)3(TMEDA)2 (ref. 67) and [Li(THF)4][YFc3(THF)2Li2]44 were
prepared
as previously
described.
Carbon
and hydrogen
elemental analysis were performed on compounds 1–6, and 2-py
by Midwest Microlab Inc.
X-ray crystallography
Details regarding the structural determination of compounds
1–6, 5Iso, 6Iso, 2-THF*, and 2-py can be found in the ESI.†
Magnetic characterization
Samples used for magnetic characterization were prepared by
thoroughly crushing the respective paramagnetic species into
a microcrystalline powder and subsequently adding between
20–40 mg to the bottom of a high purity glass NMR tube along
with solid n-eicosane (27–65 mg). The NMR tube containing
the paramagnetic species/n-eicosane mixture was equipped
with a gas line adaptor, removed from the glovebox, and was
sealed under vacuum on a Schlenk line. To prevent torqueing of
small crystallites under high magnetic elds, the solid n-eico-
sane in the sealed sample was melted by heating the sealed tube
between 40–43 C in a hot water bath, forming a solid matrix
upon cooling to room temperature.
Magnetic characterization was carried out using a Quantum
Design MPMS 3 SQUID magnetometer. The direct current (dc)
magnetic susceptibility was measured under a 0.1 T magnetic
eld between 2–300 K. A diamagnetic correction (calculated
using Pascal's constants) was included in the calculation of the
dc molar magnetic susceptibility and considers the diamagnetic
response of eicosane and the complex core electrons.68 The
variable temperature magnetization was measured between 2–8
K up to external magnetic eld strengths of 7 T. The alternating
current (ac) magnetic susceptibly was measured using a 0.2 mT
alternating eld between 1–1000 Hz using external eld
strengths of either 0 T, 0.2 T, or 0.35 T.
Synthesis
[Li(THF)4][GdFc3(THF)2Li2] (1). A 20 mL vial was charged
with GdCl3 (0.1590 g; 0.6032 mmols), THF (2 mL), and
a magnetic stir bar. The suspension was heated to 45 C and
stirred vigorously for ca. 8 hours. The suspension was then
added to a vial containing a suspension of Li6(Fe(C5H4)2)3(-
TMEDA)2 (0.6618 g; 0.8011 mmols) in THF (5–10 mL), stirred
with a glass coated stir bar, forming a cloudy red suspension.
The suspension was let stir for 16–18 hours upon which the
reaction mixture was ltered through Celite. The dark red
ltrate was reduced under dynamic vacuum forming a viscid oil
which expanded as a sticky solid upon agitation. The red-orange
solid was washed with hexanes (4  5 mL) and was subse-
quently dried under vacuum to yield a light orange powder. The
crude product was extracted into several washings of Et2O (4  5
mL) which were ltered through Celite. The Et2O ltrate was
reduced to dryness under dynamic vacuum and the resulting
orange material was dissolved in THF (3–5 mL), ltered through
Celite, and placed into a pentane vapor diﬀusion chamber.
Pyrophoric plate crystals of 1 formed overnight at 27 C, which
were collected by decantation of the mother liquor, washing
with pentane (2  2 mL), and allowing the crystals to dry under
an Ar atmosphere at ambient temperature and pressure
(0.2166 g; yield ¼ 31.96%). *In contrast to compounds 2–6 and
2-py, elemental analysis on crystalline material of 1 using
commercial analysis services resulted in low C and H values.
This discrepancy could be due to the smaller crystals obtained
for 1 and resulting increased propensity for desolvation of THF
molecules or product decomposition prior to analysis.
[Li(THF)4][HoFc3(THF)2Li2] (2). To a 20 mL vial containing
Li6(Fe(C5H4)2)3(TMEDA)2 (0.4559 g; 0.552 mmols) in THF (5–10
mL) was added solid HoCl3 (0.1117 g; 0.412 mmols) and an
additional THF wash (4–5 mL) forming a red suspension. The
suspension was let stir for 16–18 hours upon which the reaction
mixture was ltered through Celite. The dark red ltrate was
reduced under dynamic vacuum forming a viscid oil which
expanded as a sticky solid upon agitation. The red-orange solid
was washed with hexanes (3  5 mL) and was subsequently
dried under vacuum to yield a light orange powder. The crude
product was extracted into several washings of Et2O (4  5 mL)
