1  |  INTRODUCTION
The fragmentation of wildlife habitats caused by anthropogenic ac-
tivities has reduced biodiversity and impaired key ecosystem func-
tions (Díaz et al., 2020; Gibson et al., 2013; Haddad et al., 2015). 
Current systems of protected areas are not only insufficient to sus-
tain biodiversity, but they also lack habitat connectivity. As of 2020, 
one third of the key biodiversity areas on the earth lack any coverage 
and <8% of the land is both protected and connected (UNEP, 2021). 
Connectivity (spatial and/or functional) of protected areas is a cru-
cial factor that facilitates species movements, gene flows, range 
shifts and metapopulation interactions between those habitats 
(Beier et al.,  2009; Bolger et al.,  2001). Wildlife corridors play an 
important role in promoting habitat connectivity by linking detached 
habitats patches. The optimal design of such wildlife corridors con-
sidering spatial, ecological and economic factors is the issue that we 
address in this paper.
Many factors may be taken into account to ensure a functional 
wildlife corridor. Spatial attributes of the corridor are among them. 
Two critical spatial attributes are the width and length of the corri-
dor. A wildlife corridor must be wide enough since a narrow corridor 
is unlikely to provide adequate amenities such as food and refuge 
(Andreassen et al., 1996; Coster et al., 2014). A wildlife corridor must 
also be short enough to reduce movement resistance (Haddad, 1999; 
Haddad et al., 2003; Heintzman & McIntyre, 2021) and avoid possi-
ble intervention from outside of the corridor (Haddad et al., 2014). 
A short corridor is also cost-­effective to establish and maintain. In 
addition to these spatial attributes, corridor quality is another critical

Abstract
1.	 The fragmentation of wildlife habitats caused by anthropogenic activities has 
reduced biodiversity and impaired key ecosystem functions. Wildlife corridors 
play an important role in linking detached habitats. The optimal design of such 
corridors considering spatial, ecological and economic factors is addressed in 
this paper.
2.	 We present a novel graph-­theoretic optimisation approach and a mixed-­integer 
linear programming model to determine an optimal wildlife corridor connecting 
two given habitat patches. The model maximises the total quality of the corridor 
and satisfies pre-­specified corridor width and length requirements under a re-
source constraint.
3.	 Compared to the corridor design models presented in the literature, our model 
is conceptually simpler, and it is computationally convenient. We applied the 
model to a real dataset for Eldorado National Forest in California, USA, involving 
1,363 irregular land parcels.
4.	 The model can be extended to design multiple corridors that connect two or 
more existing habitat patches.

aspect. A corridor with a high habitat quality presents lower resis-
tance to traversal (Hodgson et al., 2011; Sawyer et al., 2011). Lastly, 
financial factors can be important determinants of the location and 
shape of the corridor.
The problem of identifying wildlife corridors has been stud-
ied using various methods, including heuristic algorithms (e.g. 
Alagador et al., 2012), geographic information systems (e.g. Matisziw 
et al., 2015) and graph theory, and its extensions including least-­cost 
modelling (e.g. Vanthomme et al.,  2019), circuit theory (e.g. Koen 
et al., 2014) and centrality analyses (Estrada & Bodin, 2008). Several 
conservation planning software, such as C-­Plan, Zonation, Marxan 
(see Sarkar (2012) for a review) and MulTyLink (Brás et al., 2013), 
have been used for identifying desirable corridors between detached 
habitats. These tools employed heuristic algorithms (such as simu-
lated annealing) that find quick solutions at the expense of some loss 
of optimality (ecological, economic or both). In contrast, as discussed 
in numerous papers (Billionnet, 2013; Williams et al., 2005), formal 
optimisation, specifically mixed-­integer linear programming (MILP), 
guarantees optimality of the site selection solutions and therefore 
promotes optimal allocation of scarce conservation resources. In 
general, dealing with conservation planning problems in an opti-
misation framework that incorporates spatial attributes presents 
methodological and computational challenges. The optimum wildlife 
corridor design problem is no exception. The challenge is greater es-
pecially when too many candidate land parcels of irregular shapes 
are involved, which is often the case in real-­world conservation 
planning. The corridors that connect two (or more) detached hab-
itat patches must themselves be comprised of spatially connected 
areas. Enforcing spatial connectivity together with corridor length 
and width considerations is methodologically possible, but it can be 
difficult computationally. However, such problems are not solved on 
a frequent basis. Even relatively small gains provided by optimal or 
nearly optimal solutions may well overweigh the methodological and 
computational difficulties.
In the biological conservation literature, only a few studies have 
addressed the optimal design of wildlife corridors. Williams (1998) 
modelled the problem as a Steiner-­tree problem using a two-­objective 
integer programming model. Williams and Snyder (2005) formulated 
the problem as a shortest-­path problem and introduced an opti-
misation model based on percolation theory. Phillips et al.  (2008) 
used network flows and developed an integer programming model 
to optimise the dispersal corridors for a family of endemic plants, 
the Cape Proteaceae, in the Western Cape of South Africa. They 
used a regular grid of square cells covering the targeted landscape 
and minimised the total selected area while satisfying each species' 
range size. Alagador et al. (2016) extended that method to identify 
dispersal corridors for the European mink and the four-­leaf clover 
in the Iberian Peninsula. Conrad et al. (2012) cast the optimal cor-
ridor design problem as a connected subgraph problem where the 
amount of suitable habitat is maximised in a fully connected network 
of parcels linking two habitat patches subject to a constraint on the 
funds available for land acquisition. They varied the granularity of 
the parcels available for acquisition by assembling adjacent parcels 
into larger polygons and used those polygons as selection units for 
the potential wildlife corridor. Dilkina et al. (2017) presented a MILP 
model which designs a wildlife corridor for multiple species with a 
given budget and applied their model to grizzly bears and wolverines 
in western Montana, USA. None of the studies mentioned above ex-
plicitly modelled the corridor width and length among the site selec-
tion criteria. Therefore, typically the selected corridors had a width 
of only one land parcel. Yemshanov et al. (2021) developed a MILP 
model to achieve a fixed corridor width by imposing the selection of 
all parcels in the vicinity of selected path nodes. Specifically, if a node 
is selected to be part of the path, all parcels within a certain distance 
from that node must be selected into the corridor space. They iden-
tified optimal corridors for caribou populations in a region of north-
ern Ontario, Canada. The requirement of a uniform grid partition is 
an important restrictiveness of their approach. To our knowledge, 
only two studies, St John et al. (2016) and St John et al. (2018), ex-
plicitly modelled the corridor width and length problem considering 
irregular land parcels. They combined path planning techniques from 
the theory of artificial intelligence and network optimisation; specif-
ically, they selected eligible polygons as building blocks, identified 
gate pairs for each triplet of those polygons, found the optimal route 
and associated width and length for each triplet and each of its gate 
pairs, and then solved the optimal corridor problem using MILP.
In this paper, we present a novel approach and a MILP model 
to determine the optimal configuration of a wildlife corridor con-
necting two existing habitat patches while considering the corridor 
width, length and habitat quality of candidate sites as explicit site se-
lection criteria. The model is applicable to both regular and irregular 
partitions. We present a numerical application of the model to a real 
landscape involving 1,363 sites and two habitat patches in Eldorado 
National Forest in California, USA. Finally, we discuss possible ex-
tensions of the model.
2  |  MATERIALS AND METHODS
We define a wildlife corridor as a ‘band’ of connected land parcels 
that links two or more wildlife habitat patches. The parcels in the 
band are enclosed by two boundaries, called the ‘left boundary’ and 
the ‘right boundary’, where each boundary is incident to (i.e. starts 
from or ends at) one of the two habitat patches. The nomination 
of the left and right is just to differentiate the two boundaries of 
the corridor, they are completely interchangeable and will be de-
termined endogenously by the model. We use two habitat patches 
and one corridor to demonstrate the method. The extension of the 
model for linking multiple habitats with multiple corridors will be dis-
cussed in the Discussion section.
We use the network flow theory to determine the corridor bound-
aries. We start with a partition of the area where the spatial units are 
the candidate sites (land parcels) considered for corridor formation. 
We overlay a directed planar network structure on the partition. We 
say that two sites are adjacent if they share a common edge. A junc-
tion point is defined as the point where two or more edges of the land

parcels meet. The nodes and arcs of the network correspond to the 
junction points and edges of the land parcels. We define two arcs for 
each edge, one in each direction, linking the corresponding junction 
points. Each boundary is composed of a flow of arcs starting from 
one junction point on the border of one habitat patch, runs through 
a series of mutually adjacent arcs and reaches one junction point on 
the border of the other habitat patch.
We illustrate these concepts using a simple landscape with six 
land parcels separating two wildlife habitat patches labelled with 
H1 and H2 in Figure 1. The land parcels are indexed with i1 to i6, 
the junction points are shown with black dots indexed with k1 to 
k13 and the parcel edges are indexed with e1 to e13. The parcels 
i1 and i2 are adjacent since they share the edge e2. An edge links 
two adjacent junction points, such as e1 linking the junction points 
k1 and k5. An arc directs from one junction point along the edge 
of a parcel to an adjacent junction point, such as the arc directing 
from k1 to k5 along edge e1. An edge either separates two adjacent 
parcels (such as e2 separating parcels i1 and i2), or it is on the bor-
der of the planning area (such as the edge e1 of parcel i1). The bold 
arcs represent the corridor boundaries. The left boundary (which we 
arbitrarily nominate here) starts from the junction point k1 on the 
border of H1, extends through k5 and k6, and ends at the junction 
point k12, which is on the border of H2. Likewise, the right boundary 
starts from the junction point k3, extends through k8, k9 and k10, 
and ends at the junction point k13. The junction points k1, k2, k3 and 
k4 are on the border of H1, while the junction points k11, k12 and 
k13 are on the border of H2. In the mathematical model, the desig-
nation of the start and end points of the boundaries is restricted only 
to these two sets of junction points. If an arc is selected as part of 
the boundary, such as the arc k5 → k6, then one of the two parcels 
separated by it (here i1 and i5) is selected into the corridor (in the 
figure i1 is selected). If a selected arc is on the border of the conser-
vation planning area, such as the arc k10 → k13, the parcel to which 
it belongs must be selected (i6 in the figure). Conversely, when a 
parcel is selected as part of the corridor while an adjacent parcel is 
not selected, one of the two directed arcs corresponding to the edge 
between these two parcels must be on one of the two boundaries. In 
Figure 1, the parcels i1, i2, i4 and i6 are selected to form the corridor. 
Only one of the adjacent land parcels i2 and i3 is selected, thus the 
arc k3 → k8 that separates them must be on a boundary (the right 
boundary in the figure). On the other hand, the parcel i3 and the arc 
k4 → k10 are not included in the site and arc selection, thus they are 
not in the corridor.
The optimal corridor design problem is equivalent to the optimal 
selection of the arcs that form the two boundaries. The distance be-
tween any two arcs (edges) is measured as the shortest distance be-
tween them. For a partition composed of parcels with regular shapes, 
such as squares or rectangles, such distances can be measured as 
the shortest distances between the endpoints of the corresponding 
edges. When irregular shapes are involved, the shortest distances 
can be determined using geographical analysis tools, such as geo-
graphic information system, as we did in the numerical application. 
To ensure a minimal corridor width, we require that if the distance 
between any two arcs is less than a specified width threshold, then 
the two arcs cannot be selected simultaneously with one arc serving 
as part of one boundary while the other serving as part of the other 
boundary. We consider the total length of the two boundaries as a 
proxy to the length of the corridor, and we impose an upper limit on 
this length to ensure a sufficiently short corridor. The average or the 
shorter of the two boundaries can be used as alternative proxies. In 
the corridor optimisation model we present below, these properties 
can be modelled easily as explicit constraints. The objective function 
of the model is defined as the total habitat quality of the selected 
corridor sites, which is to be maximised under a given conservation 
resource constraint. The resource constraint can be a monetary 
budget restriction or an upper limit for the total area of the corridor.

of land parcel edges; ci: the cost of including parcel i in the corridor; 
qi: the quality of parcel i; le: the length of edge e; r: the conservation 
resource limit; lb: the boundary length limit; de,ea: the distance be-
tween edges e and ea. This distance is the shortest distance between 
arcs (k, l) and (ka, la) where (k, l) and (ka, la) are the junction points 
on edge e and ea respectively; Nk: the set of junction points linked 
to junction point k by an edge; B1, B2: sets of junction points on the 
borders of H1 and H2 respectively. We require that each boundary 
of the corridor starts from a single junction point in B1 and reaches 
a single junction point in B2; p(i, j, k, l): pairs of adjacent land parcels 
i and j and their common edge represented by junction points k and 
l. Note that k and l both cannot belong to B1 or B2; bp(i, k, l): similar 
to p(i, j, k, l), but defined for border parcels i, with k and l being the 
two junction points of i’s edge on the border of the planning area; w: 
corridor width threshold; Ui: binary variable which equals 1 if parcel 
i is selected as part of the corridor, and 0 otherwise; VLk, VRk: binary 
variables which equal 1 if the junction point k is selected as part of 
the left or the right boundary, respectively, and 0 otherwise; XLkl, 
XRkl: binary variables which equal 1 if the arc directing from k to l 
is selected as part of the left or the right boundary, respectively, 
and 0 otherwise; YLe, YRe: binary variables which equal 1 if edge e 
is selected as part of the left or the right boundary, respectively, 
and 0 otherwise. These two variables are used when calculating the 
boundary length of the corridor.
The model presented below determines the highest-­quality wild-
life corridor between H1 and H2 under the resource availability r 
while satisfying the minimum width and maximum boundary length 
requirements for the corridor.
The objective function (1) represents the total quality of the 
corridor (to be maximised). Constraints (2a) through (2d) select one 
junction point for each boundary from the border of each habitat 
patch. Constraints (3a) through (3d) define the arcs between adjacent 
junction points. Constraint (4) states that a junction point can be se-
lected either on the left or right boundary, but not both. Constraints 
(5a) through (5c) associate the selection of arcs with that of the land 
parcels. These constraints are adapted from Önal and Briers (2003) 
where the purpose was the minimisation of the reserve boundary. 
Constraint (6) states the minimum width requirement. Constraints 
(7a) and (7b) associate the selection of the arcs with that of the edges. 
Constraint (8) states that the total length of the selected edges should 
not exceed the boundary length limit. Finally, constraint (9) ensures 
that the total cost does not exceed the budget availability.

We first show the workings of the model using a regular grid parti-
tion involving 10 rows and 10 columns, thus 10 × 10 = 100 square 
cells. The side length of each cell is 1 (Figure 2). We supposed that 
two habitats, one located at the upper-­right corner and the other 
at the lower-­left corner, are to be connected by a corridor. We de-
signed two scenarios. In the first scenario, we set the width thresh-
old as one cell, the budget limit allows selecting at most 10 cells, 
and the limit on the boundary length is 20. In terms of the notation

introduced above, w = 1, r = 10 and lb = 20. In the second scenario, 
we set those parameters as w = 2, r = 22 and lb = 22. We specified 
the values of r and lb in the first scenario based on the observa-
tion that at least 10 cells are needed to form a corridor with a width 
of one cell and a boundary length of 20. The values in the second 
scenario were specified similarly. In both scenarios, we randomly 
generated the site quality values from a uniform [1,5] distribution 
and rounded them to the nearest integers.

the corridors are 35 and 65 respectively. The model could be solved 
to exact optimality in <1 s in both cases.
We tested the model’s computational efficiency in solving larger 
size problems, where the number of eligible sites was increased sys-
tematically. Table 1 provides a summary of those test runs.
Table 1 shows that as the number of candidate sites is increased, 
the time needed to solve the model increases under both width 
specifications. When the width threshold is specified as w = 2 and 
more than 1,200 sites are considered, a solution very close to the 
unknown optimum solution (with a gap of <3%) could be obtained 
within 1 hr.
2.3  |  An empirical application
We applied the above model to a dataset for Eldorado National 
Forest in California, USA. We downloaded the data from the 
Integrated Forest Management Lab of the Forest Management 
Optimization Site, the University of New Brunswick (http://ifmlab.
for.unb.ca/fmos/datas​ets/). Following St John et al. (2018), we sup-
posed that a wildlife corridor must connect the two habitat areas 
located at the north-­west and the south-­east sections of the for-
est (Figure  3). The dataset was in the format of polygon shape-
files and contained 1,363 irregular land parcels. We prepared the 
sets and the parameters involved in the mathematical model using 
ArcGIS (v10.2). Specifically, we transformed those 1,363 polygons 
into 4,214 polylines (edges of the land parcels) using the Polygon-­
To-­Line function in ArcToolbox and identified all pairs of adjacent 
land parcels and their common edges using the attribute table of the 
resulting polyline file. We identified 2,858 junction points for those 
polylines using the Planarize-­Lines function in Advanced Editing 
(Figure 3a), and we found all pairs of edges within a distance under 
300 m using the Generate-­Near-­Table function included in Analysis 
Tools in ArcToolbox (we used these pairs of edges in the corridor 
width constraint 6 in the model). We created a personal geodatabase 
in ArcGIS to place these data and used the program mdb2gms.exe 
included in GAMS to convert them to a GAMS readable format (.inc). 
We calculated the total forest area as 211.47 km2. We first specified 
the budget limit (corridor area) as 15% of the total forest area (as in 
St John et al., 2018), which is 31.72 km2, and the maximum corridor 
length as 100 km. Then, to provide an alternative plan, we reduced 
the budget limit to 30.00 km2 and the corridor length limit to 95 km. 
The corridor width threshold specified below and the long distance 
between the two habitat areas did not allow us to reduce these limits 
further because the model was infeasible with lower limits. The orig-
inal data did not include any land quality characteristics. To incor-
porate habitat quality in the site selection, we randomly generated 
the habitat quality of each land parcel from a uniform distribution 
of [1,5] and rounded it to the nearest integer. We fixed the corridor 
width threshold at 300 m.

boundary length limits (compare the values in columns two and 
three with those in column one). When the area and the length limits 
were decreased from 31.72 to 30.00 km2 and from 100 to 95 km, 
respectively, the total quality of the corridor decreased from 757 to 
654. This is an expected and intuitive result since a tighter limit on 
the conservation resource must normally generate a corridor with a 
lower total quality. We solved the model to exact optimality in about 
70 and 90 min, respectively, for the two planning alternatives.
Habitat quality was not a consideration in St John et al. (2018). 
Thus, the corridors selected by our model are not directly compara-
ble to those found by St John et al. (2018) in terms of their shape and 
location. However, we have observed that some segments of the 
corridors we have found were remarkably wider than those found 
by St John et al. (2018). This is because their building block polygons 
were either the original land parcels (most of which have an area of 
20 ha or less), or were restricted to multiple parcels with a combined 
area not exceeding 20 ha. This restriction made the polygon selec-
tion computationally tractable but generated polygons not much 
different in size (all under 20 ha except a few large original parcels). 
The corridor, then, was constructed as a row of those building block 
polygons, resulting in a width somewhat consistent throughout the 
corridor. Our model selects the land parcels to maximise the total 
quality of the corridor while satisfying the width and the length re-
quirements. Some clustered, good-­quality parcels were selected by 
the model to the extent permitted by the budget constraint. This 
explains the presence of relatively ‘wide’ segments in the optimal 
corridors displayed in Figure 3.
4  |  DISCUSSION
Among the four parameters involved in the model, the limit on the 
boundary length (lb) is relatively easy to specify based on the loca-
tions of the existing habitats to connect and the movement behav-
iour of the species of concern. This is an important advantage of 
the optimisation model we present in this paper compared to the 
model presented by St John et al. (2018). Unlike the direct approach 
we use here, which employs raw spatial data, St John et al. (2018) 
employ path planning techniques to generate the input data needed 
in the optimisation model. This is a complicated data processing pro-
cedure that requires additional steps (triangulation and determining 
pseudo-­edges, valid gate pairs, etc.) besides optimisation modelling 
and programming. The conservation resource availability (r) can be 
stated either as a monetary budget constraint or a corridor area con-
straint, which may be either given or can be specified by conser-
vation planners. However, the parameters representing the habitat 
quality of land parcels (qi) and the width threshold (w) may be difficult 
to compile and specify. These parameters have to be determined ac-
cording to the needs of the targeted species and the characteristics 
of the corridor intended to serve those species. They can be speci-
fied in coordination with field experts based on the biological and/
or ecological factors affecting the species' movement behaviour and 
habitat requirements, and environmental and ecological attributes 
of the individual sites in the potential corridor area. Mathematicians, 
biologists, ecologists and managers must work together to deter-
mine those attributes and processes. The quality of individual land 
parcels can be assessed better using species distribution models 
based on available species occurrence data, and it may also be evalu-
ated by taking into account the socio-­economic aspects, such as 
productivity of those lands and the stakeholders' preferences (Beier 
et al., 2011). A recent study by Ford et al. (2020) found that the width 
threshold may also depend on the surrounding landscape, such as 
the residential or recreational values of those areas.
Ensuring corridor contiguity in an optimisation framework is 
both methodologically and computationally intensive. The optimis-
ation model becomes further difficult to solve when corridor width 
and length requirements are also imposed. To achieve corridor conti-
guity, we impose a tight limit on the length of the corridor boundary. 
This not only eliminates the possibility of generating a disconnected 
corridor, but it also remarkably improves the model’s computational 
performance. Such a limit on the boundary length can be estimated 
easily for a landscape composed of regular grid cells with straight 
edges (e.g. squares or rectangles). For landscapes partitioned with 
irregularly shaped land parcels, as we have used in the empirical ap-
plication, a small value could make the model infeasible. When this 
occurs, the solution process is terminated quickly (typically within 
seconds or minutes). One may gradually increase the limit until a 
feasible solution is found. The first feasible solution provides a good 
starting point that may be helpful to generate an optimal corridor.
The method may be extended to address some other important 
concerns in wildlife corridor planning. One such concern is linking 
the existing habitats through a corridor that contains pre-­specified 
intermediate habitat areas. Including critical intermediate habitat 
areas in the corridor may be necessary because of various reasons, 
such as consideration of strategic points in the landscape that may 
sustain certain ecological processes, maintain ecosystem integrity or 
provide food and water amenities. To address this issue, additional 
constraints must be imposed to enforce that the sites in those inter-
mediate habitats are selected and that the left and right boundaries 
extend to and leave from some junction points on the borders of 
those habitats.
An important issue is the presence of barriers and linear el-
ements, such as a river or a gully, in the landscape considered for 
conservation planning. Such landscape characteristics may impose

serious resistance to the movement of organisms through that par-
cel. This can be incorporated in the model indirectly during the par-
cel quality assessment, namely by assigning a very low parcel quality 
which would make the parcel unlikely to be part of the corridor.
Another extension of the one-­corridor model presented here 
is concerned with designing multiple corridors connecting two 
(or more) existing habitat areas. This may be desirable when the 
existing habitat areas are large and have long borders, therefore 
multiple corridors between them would serve species movements 
better than a single corridor. A simple case, for instance, is two 
existing habitat areas to be connected via two disjoint corridors 
(i.e. without intersection). This can be achieved by applying the 
model to find the first corridor, then applying the model again to 
find the second corridor but enforcing that the land parcels, junc-
tion points and edges included in the first corridor cannot be part 
of the second corridor. Note that this stepwise optimisation ap-
proach determines one corridor at a time, rather than determining 
the two corridors simultaneously. Therefore, this approach may 
lead to a suboptimal solution. The true optimal solution can be 
determined by defining two sets of variables, one set for each cor-
ridor. That, however, makes the model substantially larger, thus 
harder to solve.
In the past few decades, computation techniques and computer 
hardware have evolved very fast. The model we developed here can 
be solved using distributed parallel algorithms that allow the usage 
of multiple processors in a cooperative manner, or using cloud com-
puting services, such as the Amazon Web Services. We anticipate 
that such services might enable us to solve large-­scale conservation 
planning problems, including the corridor design problem.
Finally, we emphasise that our focus here has been primarily on 
the ‘how-­to’ aspect of solving the wildlife corridor problem, assum-
ing that we know which habitats to connect. The latter is an equally 
important and challenging problem since the impacts of fragmen-
tation on biodiversity and ecosystems are still not well-­understood 
(Fahrig, 2003, 2017, 2021; Saura, 2021). Considering a landscape as 
a network of large habitat patches, the integral index of connectiv-
ity (Pascual-­Hortal & Saura, 2006) or the probability of connectivity 
(Saura & Pascual-­Hortal, 2007) can be used along with software like 
Conefor (Saura & Torné,  2009) or Landscapemetrics (Hesselbarth 
et al.,  2019) to determine the patches that should be connected. 
Once this is done, for each pair of patches to be connected the 
model we presented here can be used to design optimal corridors 
at a finer scale.
