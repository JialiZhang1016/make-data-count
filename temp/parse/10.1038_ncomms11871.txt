Ambiphilic boron in 1,4,2,5-diazadiborinine
Baolin Wang1, Yongxin Li2, Rakesh Ganguly2, Hajime Hirao1 & Rei Kinjo1
Boranes have long been known as the archetypal Lewis acids owing to an empty p-orbital on
the boron centre. Meanwhile, Lewis basic tricoordinate boranes have been developed in
recent years. Here we report the synthesis of an annulated 1,4,2,5-diazadiborinine derivative
featuring boron atoms that exhibit both Lewis acidic and basic properties. Experimental and
computational studies conﬁrmed that two boron atoms in this molecule are spectroscopically
equivalent. Nevertheless, this molecule cleaves C–O, B–H, Si–H and P–H bonds heterolytically,
and readily undergoes [4 þ 2] cycloaddition reaction with non-activated unsaturated bonds
such as C ¼O, C ¼C, CC and CN bonds. The result, thus, indicates that the
indistinguishable boron atoms in 1,4,2,5-diazadiborinine act as both nucleophilic and
electrophilic centres, demonstrating ambiphilic nature.

A
s
classical
trivalent
boranes
inherently
possess
an
unoccupied p-orbital on the boron centre, they have
been
widely
utilized
as
electron-pair
acceptors
or
Lewis acids in synthetic chemistry1. Apart from this line of
research, isolable nucleophilic and low-valent boron species
have also attracted great attention in recent years since the
seminal work by Nozaki, Yamashita and co-workers2–11. Among
them, by installing two carbene ligands, the Bertrand group and
our group developed neutral tricoordinate organoboron species
isoelectronic with amines12–15. Braunschweig and co-workers
reported relevant species, including the ﬁrst complex featuring
two carbon monoxide ligands coordinating to a boron centre16,17.
In these twofold base adducts of monovalent boron, electrons
in the ﬁlled p-orbital of the boron centre are delocalized into the
formally empty p-orbitals or the p*-orbitals of the ligands.
Thus, the bonding situation therein is reminiscent of the s
donation and p back donation between a metal and a ligand in
conventional transition metal complexes18,19, and there seems to
exist similarity between this type of boron and transition metals,
although there is controversy regarding how to interpret such
bonding in main group compounds20–22.
Recently, it has been demonstrated that various nonmetallic
systems based on p-block elements featuring both strong electron-
donor and electron-acceptor sites or small highest occupied
molecular orbital–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO–
LUMO) gap, may be utilized for small-molecule activation23–28.
Depending on the number of sites that participate in the activation,
these nonmetallic systems can be classiﬁed into two major types.
The ﬁrst type has a nucleophilic centre and an electrophilic
centre as independent active sites. Representative examples
include
phosphine-borane-containing
species,
pioneered
by
Stephan et al.29–31, in which the phosphorus centre acts as a
Lewis base, whereas the boron centre acts as a Lewis acid.
The second type possesses a single active site with an ambiphilic
property. Bertrand and co-workers reported the ﬁrst successful,
facile
splitting
of
dihydrogen
and
ammonia
by
(alkyl)
(amino)carbenes bearing an ambiphilic divalent carbon centre
with a lone pair of electrons and a vacant orbital32. In the
boron series, only one boron derivative isoelectronic with singlet
carbenes
has
been
crystallographically
characterized,
which
exhibits a considerable electrophilic property33. Construction of
organoboron compounds containing ambiphilic elemental centres
still remains extremely challenging34. To date, a system with two
ambiphilic sites for small-molecule activation, having both of the
features mentioned above, has never been described.
Very recently, we have synthesized a 1,3,2,5-diazadiborinine
bearing two boron atoms that are spectroscopically inequivalent.
We showed that these two boron centres in an aromatic ring
cooperatively activate small molecules in which one of them
behaves as a Lewis acid centre, whereas the other serves as a Lewis
base centre35,36. The result demonstrated that incorporation of
two boron atoms into an aromatic skeleton allows for an effective
remote interaction between them through the p-system37. Herein,
we report the synthesis of 1,4,2,5-diazadiborinine in which two
equivalent boron atoms act as both nucleophilic and electrophilic
centres; thus, the compound features ambiphilic nature.
Results
Synthesis and characterization of 2. Reaction of compound 1
with excess amounts of potassium graphite (KC8) in benzene
slowly proceeded under ambient condition, and after work-up,
1,4,2,5-diazadiborinine derivative 2 was obtained as an orange
powder in 52% yield (Fig. 1a). The 11B NMR spectrum of 2 shows
a singlet at d ¼ 18.3p.p.m., which is shifted downﬁeld with respect
to that (–1.9 p.p.m.) of 1. In the 1H NMR spectrum, a peak for the
methyl groups on two nitrogen atoms was observed at d ¼ 2.90
p.p.m., and two signals for the CH protons of the imidazole ring
moieties appeared at d ¼ 6.07 and 7.40 p.p.m. These data indicate
the highly symmetric nature of the product 2, which was further
conﬁrmed by an X-ray diffraction study (Fig. 1b). The annulated
B2C2N2 six-membered ring is essentially planar, and the boron
atoms display trigonal–planar geometry with the N1–B1–C10
bond angle of 112.50(15) (the sum of the bond angles:
B1 ¼ 359.75). Both the B1–C10
(1.491(3) Å) and B1–N1
(1.458(2) Å) distances are signiﬁcantly shorter than those
(1.610(2) and (1.551(2) Å) in 1. The N1–C1 distance of 1.403(2)
Å is only slightly longer than the C1–N2 bond (1.397(2) Å). The
C2–C3 bond (1.346(2) Å) lies in the range of typical double-bond
distances of carbon–carbon bonds. These structural properties
suggest
the delocalization
of
electrons over
the p-system
including
the
six-membered
B2C2N2
ring,
which
can
be
represented by the average of the several canonical forms,
including
2a–g
(Fig.
1c).
In
the
electronic
paramagnetic
resonance spectrum of a benzene solution of 2, no signal was
detected at room temperature.
To investigate the electronic property of 2, we carried out
quantum chemical density functional theory calculations. Natural
bond orbital analysis gave a Wiberg bond index value slightly
o1.0 for the B1–N1 bond (0.94). Meanwhile, Wiberg bond index
values were 41.0 for the B1–C10 bond (1.19), the C1–N1 bond
(1.13) and the C1–N2 bond (1.10), thus suggesting the partial
double-bond character of these bonds. The HOMO of 2 exhibits a
p-system over the six-membered B2C2N2 ring with a node found
between two CBN p-units and also has large amplitudes on the
N atoms and the C ¼ C moieties of the annulated imidazole rings
(Fig. 1d). The LUMO is a p-type orbital that contains a mixture of
C–B p-bonding interactions and the p-orbital of the phenyl ring
on the B atoms. Natural population analysis shows that the two
boron atoms possess the same charge of þ 0.55.
Figure 2 summarizes the nucleus-independent chemical-shift
(NICS) values for 2, a model compound 20 and other related
compounds for comparison. The NICS values for 2 and 20 are less
negative than that of annulated indole, but comparable to that of
benzene, and more negative than those of other heterocycles,
suggesting
the
considerable
aromatic
property
of
2.
The resonance stabilization energy (RSE) value of parent
1,4,2,5-diazadiborinine 200
estimated at the B3LYP/6-311 þ
G(d,p) level is 37.9 kcal mol  1 smaller than that of benzene
(Supplementary Table 4)38,39. Since the RSE value of benzene is
estimated to be about 34 kcal mol  1, although the reported
values vary depending on the method used38,39, it can be inferred
that the aromatic character of parent 1,4,2,5-diazadiborinine 200 is
signiﬁcantly weak, in line with the less negative NICS values
for 200 than that of benzene (Fig. 2).
Reactivity. Compound 2 is thermally stable both in the solid state
and in solutions at ambient temperature, but decomposes
rapidly on exposure to air. To examine the reactivity, we ﬁrst
treated
2
with
methyl
triﬂuoromethanesulfonate
(MeOTf).
A stoichiometric amount of MeOTf was added to a benzene
solution of 2 at ambient temperature. After removing the solvent
under vacuum, 3 was obtained as a mixture of diastereomers (1:1)
in 87% yield (Fig. 3). An X-ray diffraction study revealed the
solid-state structure of one of the diastereomers. The methyl
group is attached to one of the boron atoms, while an oxygen
atom of the triﬂate forms a bond with the other boron atom
(Fig. 4), suggesting that two spectroscopically indistinguishable
boron atoms in 2 may act as both nucleophilic and electrophilic
centres. Because two boron atoms interact with each other
through the p-system, it is reasonable to predict that when one

boron centre in 2 behaves as a Lewis base, the other boron
centre takes on Lewis acidic character, as presented by the
resonance forms 2e–f (Fig. 1c). Having observed the ambiphilic
nature of the boron atoms in 2, we considered it likely that 2
would act as a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP)30,31. This hypothesis
was borne out by further examination of the reactions between 2
and pinacolborane (HBpin) as well as arylsilane derivatives
(PhSiH3 and Ph2SiH2) because the reactions proceeded cleanly,
and after work-up, adducts 4 and 5 were isolated in good
yields (4, 83%; 5a, 87%; 5b, 85%). In contrast to the case of 3,
both products 4 and 5 were obtained as single diastereomers. 2
could
readily
activate
the
P–H
bond
of
diarylphosphine
[(p-FC6H4)2PH] as well to afford product 6 in 85% yield.
Products 3, 4, 5a and 6 were fully characterized by standard
spectroscopic methodologies and X-ray diffractometry (Fig. 4).
In the solid-state structures of 4 and 5a, the Bpin or Ph2HSi
group and the H atom on the B atom are attached on the same
side of the six-membered B2C2N2 ring. By contrast, the
(FH4C6)2P group and the H atom on the B atom in 6 point in
opposite directions.
Next,
we
employed
molecules
involving
non-activated
unsaturated bonds as reactants. When CO2 gas was introduced
into a benzene solution of 2 at 1 bar, a white precipitate was
instantaneously formed at room temperature. After work-up,

compound 7 was isolated in 76% yield. We also performed a
13C-labelling study employing
13CO2, which afforded 7-13C
quantitatively. The 13C NMR spectrum of 7-13C showed a broad
singlet at 195.6 p.p.m. In the 11B NMR spectrum, a set of new
broad peaks was detected at d ¼  1.0 and  10.8 p.p.m. An
X-ray diffraction study revealed the bicyclo[2.2.2] structure
involving two boron atoms at the bridgehead, which was formed
via [4 þ 2] cycloaddition between 2 and one of the two C ¼ O
double bonds of CO2. 2 was also able to activate styrene in a
similar manner, to afford the corresponding bicyclo[2.2.2]
derivative 8 stereoselectively as a single diastereomer in 83%
yield. Analogously, the reaction of 2 with 1,1-diphenylpropa-1,2-
diene
(H2C ¼ C ¼ CPh2)
proceeded
smoothly,
and
clean
formation of 9 through regioselective [4 þ 2] cycloaddition was
conﬁrmed (86% yield), demonstrating a rare example of allene
activation with a FLP40. Moreover, both alkyne and nitrile
derivatives
(p-BrC6H4CCH,
PhCN
and
p-ClC6H4CN)
instantly reacted with 2, to provide 10 (80% yield), 11a (73%
yield) and 11b (70% yield), respectively. All of the cycloadducts
8–10
and
11b
were
thoroughly
characterized
by
various
spectrometric methods and X-ray crystallography (Fig. 4).
Proposed mechanism based on DFT calculations. To gain
insight
into
the
reaction
mechanism,
pathways
for
the
diastereo-selective formation of 4, 5a, 8 and 9 were explored
computationally
using
Gaussian
09
at
the
B3LYP-D3(BJ)
(SCRF)/6-311 þ G(d,p)//B3LYP/6-311 þ G (d,p) level of theory
(Fig. 5)41–53. The default SCRF method was used to describe the
solvent effect of benzene. For the formation of 4 and 5a, both
concerted and stepwise pathways were examined. However, only
concerted pathways could be determined (Fig. 5a,b), suggesting
that
these
reactions
proceed
in
a
concerted
mechanism.
This explains why the H atom on the B atom and the Bpin
group in 4 or the Ph2HSi group in 5 are attached on the same side
of the six-membered B2C2N2 ring. The relatively high free
energy barrier (22.0 kcal mol  1) for the formation of 4 is
consistent with the fact that elevated temperature (50 C) was
required to accelerate the reaction. We compared the energies of
4 and 5 with their respective diastereomers 4* and 5* that possess
the H atom on the B atom and Bpin group (4*) or Ph2HSi group
(5*) on the opposite side of the B2C2N2 ring. Both 4 and 5 are
only slightly more stable than 4* ( þ 0.4 kcal mol–1) and 5*
( þ 1.8 kcal mol–1), respectively, indicating that the reactions may
not be thermodynamically controlled.
For the reaction of 2 with styrene, we could determine two
plausible concerted pathways, which revealed that the formation
of 8 is favoured both thermodynamically and kinetically (Fig. 5c).
Thus,
product
8
is
0.6 kcal mol–1
more
stable
than
its
diastereomer 8*, and the activation barrier for the formation of
8 is 1.9 kcal mol  1 lower than that of 8*. Importantly, when
the dispersion effect was not included, the difference in barrier
height between the two pathways was only 0.4 kcal mol  1
(Supplementary Table 6), indicating the important role played
by attractive dispersion interactions, especially between the
phenyl group of styrene and the methyl group of 2, in
determining the diastereoselectivity. As shown in Fig. 1d, both
the HOMO and LUMO of 2 have signiﬁcant amplitude over the
B–C moieties rather than over the B–N moieties of the B2C2N2
six-membered ring. At the transition state, hence, to maximize
the interaction between the frontier orbitals of 2 and the p or p*
orbital of styrene, the C ¼ C bond of styrene does not lie
completely parallel to the line connecting the two B atoms of 2,
but the two carbon atoms are directed slightly towards the

midpoints of the two B–C bonds of 2. In such pathways, directing
the phenyl group of styrene towards the B atom of 2 would cause
signiﬁcant steric repulsion between the Ph rings of styrene and 2.
The transition state for the favoured pathway looks less sterically
encumbered, which could also contribute to the diastereo-
selectivity of the cycloaddition. Figure 5d shows the pathways
obtained
for
the
concerted
cycloaddition
between
2
and
H2C ¼ C ¼ CPh2. The lower-energy pathway for the formation
of 9 has an energy barrier of 15.1 kcal mol  1, which is
1.0 kcal mol  1 lower than that for the stereoisomer 9*. Interest-
ingly, the pathway to 9* has a lower barrier when dispersion is
not taken into account, but the relative energy of the transition
states
is
inverted
on
inclusion
of
the
dispersion
effect
(Supplementary Table 6). This result again highlights the
important role of dispersion in determining the regioselectivity.
Compound 9 is 7.9 kcal mol  1 less stable than 9*, and thus
formation of 9 is kinetically preferred.
The
formation
of
compound
3
as
a
mixture
of
two
diastereomers suggests that a stepwise reaction mechanism may
be involved, in addition to a concerted pathway (Fig. 6). However,
our calculations could determine only a concerted pathway that
gives 3B (Supplementary Fig. 59). This might be attributed to the
limited accuracy of density functional theory (DFT). We infer
that the initial step would be methylation of 2 by MeOTf to afford
an ionic intermediate INT-3 (Fig. 6a). In the second step, triﬂate
( OTf) could attack the tricoordinate boron centre of INT-3
from either the same side or the opposite side of the B2C2N2 ring,
to form a B–O bond. The former attack would afford 3A, whereas
the latter would give 3B. Compound 3A is estimated to be
0.2 kcal mol  1 more stable than 3B. Similarly, compound 6 may
be formed through a stepwise mechanism because the (FH4C6)2P
group and the H atom on the B atom in 6 point in opposite
directions (Fig. 6b). However, DFT calculations could determine
only a concerted pathway to afford 6* (Supplementary Fig. 59),
and thus the reaction mechanism for the formation of 6 remains
unclear, although again, a stepwise mechanism might operate
here. The possible stepwise pathways for the formation of 3 and 6
are in contrast to the concerted one in the formation of 4 and 5.

Because the H atoms in H-Bpin and Ph2SiH2 are hydridic, the
formation of the corresponding ionic intermediates such as
[2-H] [E] þ (E ¼ Bpin or SiPh2H) would be disfavoured due to
the instability of the boryl or silyl cation fragment, which
could be, at least in part, the origin of different stereo-selectivity
observed in the formation of these products 4, 5 and 6.
Isolation of ionic species as INT-3 and INT-6 is a subject of
our ongoing study.
Discussion
Stephan
and
co-workers
reported
that
an
aromatic
triphosphabenzene
featuring
a
C3P3
six-membered
ring
activates a hydrogen molecule under relatively mild conditions
to give a [3.1.0]bicylo reduction product54. It has also been
computationally conﬁrmed that the initial transition state
involves the deformation of the ﬂexible C3P3 ring to a boat
conﬁguration. Similar boat character is predicted in the transition
structure for the uncatalysed 1,4-hydrogenation of benzene55.
Likewise, at the transition states for the formation of 4, 5a, 8 and
9 (Fig. 5), we observed distortion of the B2C2N2 six-membered
ring moiety in 2, which exhibits some boat-like character. The less
signiﬁcant deformation is probably due to the lack of innate
ﬂexibility of the B2C2N2 ring skeleton. It is inferred that such
deformation may polarize frontier orbitals of 2 and enhance
zwitterionic nature at two boron atoms, which would allow them
to play cooperatively as a nucleophilic and an elctrophilic centres.
Previously, we reported reversible [4 þ 2] cycloaddition of
1,3,2,5-diazadiborinine with CO2 as well as alkenes including
ethylene35,36.
A
signiﬁcant
relevant
example
showed
that
1-bora-4-tellurocyclohexa-2,5-diene
undergoes
subsequent
[4 þ 2] cycloaddition/alkyne-elimination via a Te/B FLP-type
mechanism, reported by Stephan et al.56. These results prompted
us to examine the thermal stability of the [4 þ 2] cycloadducts 7
and 8. A C6D6 solution of 7 or 8 in a degassed J-young NMR tube
was heated and monitored by NMR spectroscopy. However, even
at 150 C, neither retro-[4 þ 2] cycloaddition nor a pronounced
decomposition
was
observed,
demonstrating
considerable
stability of these cycloadducts. This is in good agreement with
the greater computed thermodynamic stability of 8.
Collectively, we have developed a synthetic protocol for
aromatic 1,4,2,5-diazadiborinine 2. According to the NICS values
of 2, 20, 200 and benzene as well as the gap of the RSE values
between 200 and benzene, the annulation of the B2C2N2 ring in
1,4,2,5-diazadiborinine may increase the aromatic nature of
20, which is comparable to that of benzene. Nevertheless, 2
exhibits reactivity that is peculiar and much higher than that of
benzene.
Experimental
and
computational
studies
on
the
reactivity demonstrate a manifesting dual character of the boron
atoms in 2, which is capable of activating a series of small
molecules
under
mild
reaction
conditions.
Such
chemical
behaviour has never been observed for the previously reported
B2C2N2 heterocycles57–59. As the substituents on the boron and
nitrogen atoms in 1,4,2,5-diazadiborinine can be readily modiﬁed,
the steric and electronic properties as well as the reactivity could
be ﬁnely tunable. The isolation of this molecule provides a
new strategy for the development of myriad B/N-containing
p-systems, which involve two equivalent boron centres displaying
ambiphilic nature. This approach could be of particular interest to
the future design of various main group compounds featuring a
FLP-type property.

Materials. For details of spectroscopic analyses of compounds in this manuscript,
see Supplementary Figs 1–55. For details of X-ray analysis, see Supplementary
Tables 1–3, Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Data 1–11. For details of
density functional theory calculations, see Supplementary Figs 56–59,
Supplementary Tables 4–8 and Supplementary Methods.
General synthetic procedures. All reactions were performed under an atmo-
sphere of argon or nitrogen using standard Schlenk or dry box techniques; solvents
were dried over Na metal, K metal or CaH2. Reagents were of analytical grade,
obtained from commercial suppliers and used without further puriﬁcation.
1H, 11B, 13C and 19F NMR spectra were obtained with a Bruker AVIII 400 MHz
BBFO1 spectrometer at 298 K unless otherwise stated. NMR multiplicities are
abbreviated as follows: s ¼ singlet, d ¼ doublet, t ¼ triplet, m ¼ multiplet and
br ¼ broad signal. Coupling constants J are given in Hz. Most of signals for the
quaternary carbon atoms bonding to boron atom could not be detected,
presumably due to coupling with the B atom. Electrospray ionization (ESI) mass
spectra were obtained at the Mass Spectrometry Laboratory at the Division of
Chemistry and Biological Chemistry, Nanyang Technological University.
Melting points were measured with an OpticMelt Stanford Research System.
Infrared spectra were measured with the Bruker Alpha-FT-IR Spectrometer
with an ECO-ATR module. Continuous wave X-band electron paramagnetic
resonance (EPR) spectrum was checked using a Bruker ELEXSYS E500 EPR
spectrometer.
Synthesis of 1. To a tetrahydrofuran (THF; 20 ml) solution of 1-methyl-1H-
imidazole (0.55 g, 6.7 mmol), n-butyl lithium (1.6 M in hexane; 4.6 ml, 7.4 mmol)
was added dropwise at  40 C. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to
room temperature over 60 min, and then transferred to a THF (40 ml) solution of
dimethyl phenylboronate (1.0 g, 6.7 mmol) at  78 C. The mixture was warmed to
room temperature and stirred overnight. Then, trimethylsilane chloride (1.09 g,
10 mmol) was added to the mixture at  78 C, and the solution was slowly
warmed to room temperature and stirred for 5 h. After removal of all the volatiles,
the residual solid was re-dissolved in dichloromethane (DCM; 40 ml). To the
solution, boron trichloride (1 M in hexane; 6.7 ml, 6.7 mmol) was added at 0 C,
and the reaction mixture was warmed to room temperature, and stirred for 1 h.
After ﬁltration, all volatiles were removed under vacuum, and then the residue was
washed with hexane and dried under vacuum to afford compound 1 as a pale
yellow powder (1.02 g, 75%). Melting point: 235 C (dec). 1H NMR (400 MHz,

Synthesis of 2. Potassium graphite (3.76 g, 27.8 mmol) was added into a benzene
(80 ml) solution of 1 (0.71 g, 1.74 mmol) at room temperature, and the reaction
mixture was stirred for 5 days. After removal of graphite and inorganic salt by
ﬁltration, the solvent was removed under vacuum to afford 2 as an orange solid

Synthesis of 3. MeOTf (0.060 ml, 0.53 mmol) was added into a benzene (2.0 ml)
solution of 2 (180 mg, 0.53 mmol) at room temperature, and the reaction mixture
was stirred for 5 min. After removal of the solvent, the solid residue was washed
with hexane and dried under vacuum to afford a yellow solid of 3 as a 1:1
mixture of diastereomers (216 mg, 87%). Recrystallization of 3 from a mixture
of dichloromethane and hexane solution afforded single crystals of one of the
diastereomers, which was conﬁrmed by an X-ray diffraction analysis. When the
single crystals were re-dissolved in C6D6 and checked by NMR spectroscopy, two
diastereomers were observed in 1:1 ratio, suggesting that these two diastereomers
are in equilibrium in solution at room temperature (For the estimated energy
difference between two diastereomers, see Supplementary Figure 57.) *Mixture
