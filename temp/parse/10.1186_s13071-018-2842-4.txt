Abstract
Background: Male fruitflies Phortica variegata (Drosophilidae, Steganinae) are the intermediate host of the zoonotic
nematode Thelazia callipaeda (Spirurida, Thelaziidae). More than 10 years ago, when T. callipaeda was confined to
remote regions of southern Italy, ecological niche models were used to predict the potential distribution of P.
variegata across Europe and the likely risk of the nematode spreading through infected dogs travelling to/from
endemic regions. As predicted, over the last 10 years T. callipaeda has spread rapidly across Europe. Recently, we
identified the potential for its introduction to the UK through infected dogs travelling to/from endemic regions of
mainland Europe.
Methods: Here updated information is used to re-evaluate the model-predicted European, and specifically, UK
distribution to determine the likelihood of T. callipaeda becoming established. Additionally, the UK distribution of
P. variegata was further investigated through snapshot fly trapping at model-predicted locations.
Results: Ecological niche modelling using Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction (GARP) analysis suggests a
European range similar to that described previously, with some indication of potential spread further eastward.
Finer scale UK mapping suggested that P. variegata presence was limited mostly to southern England, but
highlighted regions where P. variegata has not been documented previously. The arbitrary fly trapping identified
activity of P. variegata at two locations where the species has been found previously late in the season. No
specimens were collected at model-predicted locations, although habitat suitable for the species was identified.
Conclusions: GARP-model prediction of P. variegata distribution suggests presence of suitable conditions in
previously undocumented regions of the UK and Europe and highlight the possibility for further spread of
T. callipaeda across Europe, including the UK. Further work to validate the P. variegata UK model with field data will
help improve its accuracy in predicting suitable areas, whilst surveillance of sylvatic definitive host species in such
locations is advised to monitor for evidence of autochthonous T. callipaeda transmission.

Background
Thelazia callipaeda (Spirurida: Thelaziidae) is a vector
borne, zoonotic nematode of animal and public health
importance capable of infecting a range of host species,
including dogs and cats, foxes, wolves, rabbits and
humans [1]. Adult worms reside in the conjunctiva and
surrounding structures of their definitive host, causing a
range of clinical outcomes from asymptomatic carriage
through to severe ocular pathology including blepharitis,
conjunctivitis and corneal ulceration [2]. In recent years,
T. callipaeda appears to have spread rapidly through
Europe: since 2003 the list of endemic countries has
expanded from Italy [3], where autochthonous transmis-
sion was first recorded in Europe, to include France,
Switzerland,
Germany,
Spain,
Portugal,
Bosnia
and
Herzegovina,
Croatia,
Romania,
Bulgaria,
Hungary,
Greece, Slovakia and Serbia [4–15]. Zoonotic infections
have been diagnosed in endemic regions of Europe on
several occasions, demonstrating the importance of its
spread to public health [2, 15–17]. To date, DNA
sequence analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome c
oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene performed on specimens
collected from several different host species across Eur-
ope has demonstrated presence of a single haplotype
(h1). This suggests spread of T. callipaeda in Europe has
occurred from a single introduction event and/or that
this haplotype (h1) is well adapted for survival and
transmission in Europe [18].
Travel of companion animals between European coun-
tries provides an opportunity for further dissemination
of T. callipaeda. For example, in 2016 patent infections
were imported to the UK on at least two occasions in
animals with a history of travel to T. callipaeda endemic
areas [19], whilst the introduction of the parasite to
Spain is thought to have occurred through the import-
ation of infected hunting dogs from Italy and France [8].
Furthermore, zoonotic infections acquired during travel
abroad may also facilitate the introduction of T. callipaeda
to non-endemic countries on a global scale, emphasising
the need for a “One Health” approach for the surveillance
of such disease [20].
A critical determinant of T. callipaeda spread and dis-
tribution is the presence of intermediate host species. In
Europe, males of Phortica variegata (Drosophilidae:
Steganinae) are intermediate hosts and vectors under
natural conditions [21]. These flies are typically associ-
ated with oak (Quercus spp.) woodland habitats and fruit
farms [21] and primarily feed on fermenting sap runs
and fruit. Additionally (and importantly), males exhibit
zoophagic behaviour, feeding on the lacrimal secretions
of humans and animals [21]. It is through this behaviour
that male flies transmit T. callipaeda, becoming infected
through the ingestion of L1 larvae when feeding on in-
fected hosts, and depositing infective L3 larvae onto the
eyes of new definitive hosts when they feed again. Devel-
opment from L1 to L3 occurs on the surface of testes of
the fly, at which point infective L3 larvae migrate to the
oesophagus and proboscis to be transmitted to a defini-
tive host [22]. This process typically takes 14–21 days
from the point of ingestion. In southern Europe, flies are
active from May to October with optimal temperatures
(20–25 °C) and humidity (50–70%) present in July and
August leading to greater activity and likelihood for
T. callipaeda transmission at this time [21, 23]. Eco-
logical niche modelling in 2006 demonstrated that the
potential distribution of P. variegata ranged widely across
southern and central Europe, extending as far north as
Denmark, the southern tip of Sweden and south-eastern
England [23].
Whilst P. variegata is present in the UK, it is currently
listed as a species of conservation concern under Section
41 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities
Act 2006 [24]. There have, however, been a number of
observations
of
this
species
in
recent
years
[25].
Additionally, questions exist concerning its biology and
ecology in the UK including the length of its active fly-
ing season. Understanding both geographical distribu-
tion and the length of flying season of P. variegata are of
importance when evaluating the potential for T. calli-
paeda introduction to the UK and the likelihood of au-
tochthonous transmission occurring, especially in wild
carnivores such as foxes.
The aim of this study was to re-visit the Genetic
Algorithm
for
Rule-set
Prediction
(GARP)
model
analysis described by Otranto et al. [23] to predict eco-
logical niche distribution for P. variegata across Europe
using updated climate data and P. variegata records.
This is important given recent climate change trends in
Europe and the UK. Furthermore, to help determine
whether autochthonous transmission of T. callipaeda
might occur, particular consideration was given to the
UK through fine-scale mapping and field sampling for
model validation.
Methods
Ecological niche modelling
GPS co-ordinates were obtained from European records
[26, 27], and derived from the UK literature [25, 28–30].
To avoid retrospective extrapolation of climate data,
only locations recorded post 1950 were selected for in-
clusion. Only a single observation per GPS coordinate
was included to avoid duplication of data. These selec-
tion criteria yielded 243 locations for P. variegata
from across Europe (at longitudes from 8°W - 48°E and
latitudes from 36°N - 63°N) including 19 from the
UK. Seventy-one locations were newly identified since
2006.

The software application DesktopGarp (http://nhm.ku.

was
used
to
model
P.
variegata
distribution across Europe and, specifically, the UK. For
European models, spatial datasets for fixed variables
included mapped altitude (m) and slope from the
ETOPO1 dataset [31], meteorological records (1959–
2015) for annual mean rainfall (mm), temperature (°C),
diurnal temperature range or DTR (°C), wet days (de-
fined as days above 1 mm rainfall), potential evapotrans-
piration or PET (mm) [32], and solar irradiance (W/m2)
derived from satellite estimates [33]. All fields were
interpolated to a regular 0.25° × 0.25° spatial grid (at
longitudes from 23.875°W - 45.375°E and latitudes from
30°N - 71.375°N).
For UK models a higher spatial resolution was ob-
tained through interpolation to a regular 0.05° × 0.05°
spatial grid (at longitudes from 12°W - 4°E and latitudes
from 49°N - 60°N). Altitude data was again derived from
the ETOPO1 dataset, whilst meteorological records
(1977–2015) for temperature, DTR, wet days, sunshine
duration (hours per day) and PET data were based on
the UKCP09 gridded observation dataset [34] available
at 5 × 5 km.
The model for Europe was calculated using all 243
points of P. variegata presence dating from 1959–2015.
For the UK, 19 points were available dating from 1977–
2015. As part of the GARP modelling process, pseudo-
absence data points equal to the number of presence
points were also randomly generated and incorporated
into the analyses. The reader is invited to refer to
Stockwell and Peter, 1999 for further details about this
algorithm [35]. Statistical parameters set for both models
were 100 runs, 0.01 coverage and 1000 of maximum it-
erations with rules set as negated range and logistic
regression only. Models with a non-zero omission error
and significance values of lower than 0.05 (95% confi-
dence interval) were retained. This resulted in 16/100
and 33/100 models being used for Europe and the UK,
respectively. Heat maps were constructed showing
the percentage of models agreeing on suitable areas
for P. variegata for each interpolated spatial grid
point (see Fig. 1), instead of using a median estimate
based on the multi-model ensemble [23].
Field sampling
To evaluate model accuracy, and to try and identify and
generate additional P. variegata occurrence data, six
locations were visited in late summer 2017. Firstly, to
establish an effective sampling protocol three locations
where P. variegata has previously been identified were
visited in the last week of August (Table 1). Following
successful identification of P. variegata at two of these
locations, a further three locations were sampled the
following week (Table 1). These locations were areas of
dense deciduous woodland (including Quercus spp.) lo-
cated at (or close to) areas where the newly developed
UK GARP model predicted the potential presence of P.
variegata. This was achieved by overlaying the fine scale
(0.05° × 0.05° spatial grid) UK map in Google Earth Pro®
(https://www.google.com/earth/) [36].
Locations with areas of established oak woodland with
scrub undergrowth were chosen for trapping due to
their suitability as habitat for P. variegata. Sampling at
each location consisted a four hour period between 10:
00 and 14:00 h on the date specified (Table 1). Bait
consisted of fermented fruit (chopped banana, apple and
pear sealed in an airtight container and left at room
temperature for 48 h) used with either a sweep net to
catch visiting flies, or in four bottle traps prepared as
previously described [21, 37] and hung in the vicinity for
the duration of the sampling period. Both bait and bottle
traps were hung at a height of 1–2m above ground level.
All the specimens collected were preserved in 70%
ethanol on the day of trapping to retain both morpho-
logical and molecular integrity for species identification,
dissection and (if indicated) PCR analysis. Phortica var-
iegata were positively identified through comparison to
previously described morphological features [23]. Male
P. variegata specimens were dissected to check for T.
callipaeda infection status: the thorax (oesophagus),
head and proboscis were dissected and examined under
low power magnification (×4–10) for infective third
stage larvae, whilst testicular tissue was removed and ex-
amined
under
higher
magnification
(×20–40)
for
encysted first and second stage larvae. Had nematodes
been observed, the intention was to establish their iden-
tity through a combination of morphological description
and molecular analysis.
Results
The European distribution predicted by the GARP
model (Fig. 1a) indicated that large areas are suitable for
the development of P. variegata, with the geographic
range extended further east (e.g. over Ukraine, Russia
and northern Turkey) compared to that published by
Otranto et al. [23]. Finer scale mapping of P. variegata
distribution in the UK (Fig. 1b) showed it was likely to
be limited to the south and east of England. This in-
cluded locations where P. variegata has been identified
previously (south Gloucestershire, Dorset, Hampshire
and Kent), and also regions where no prior records exist
including Surrey, Sussex, Suffolk, Essex, Somerset and
Worcestershire (Fig. 1b). This map has been made pub-
licly accessible through the University of Liverpool’s online
research data catalogue (http://datacat.liverpool.ac.uk/id/
eprint/434) [36].
Field sampling at locations where P. variegata had
previously been identified yielded four specimens in two

of the three localities (Table 1). All P. variegata speci-
mens were collected through sweep net trapping around
fermented fruit bait, none were caught in the bottle traps.
Specimens were identified morphologically as P. variegata
based on key features (Fig. 2): briefly, specimens measured
3.5–5 mm in length, with red coloured eyes encircled by a
pale white ring (Fig. 2b); the arista of each antenna had
three to six short dorsal branches of decreasing length
towards the tip (Fig. 2c); the scutum was patterned with
dark, confluent spots; the discal and second basal wing

cells were separated by an additional cross-vein (Fig. 2d);
the abdomen had a yellow and brown pattern consisting
of three transversal and one longitudinal dark band on a
paler sub-colour (Fig. 2e); the legs had three distinctive
dark bands around the tibia, dark coloured coxae and
femur, with the latter also having a paler base and apex
(Fig. 2f) [23].
No P. variegata were collected from the three loca-
tions predicted to be suitable by the model, although at
all three suitable habitat was found in the form of oak
(Quercus spp.) woodland with underlying scrubland
(Table 1). Furthermore, evidence of active sap runs were
detected on some trees and at one location a commer-
cial apple orchard was also found in the immediate
vicinity (Table 1). All six locations had public footpaths.
Owners were regularly observed walking their dogs
through these areas. A single male P. variegata was
caught at one location where P. variegata had been
documented previously (Table 1), but no nematode
larvae were detected following dissection.
Discussion
Our study updates the ecological niche model by
Otranto et al. [23], which was based on 240 known loca-
tions of P. variegata from across Europe and used cli-
matic data from 1960–1990. Subsequent reports of
autochthonous transmission in multiple European coun-
tries in the intervening period have proven the validity
of that approach, namely determining the ecological and
environmental conditions suitable for P. variegata [5–9,
11–15]. In the current study, ecological niche model
analysis using up to date climate information and 71
new P. variegata locations indicates the potential for fur-
ther introduction of T. callipaeda to new regions of Eur-
ope, including the UK.
The ecological niche models presented here for Europe
are largely in agreement with those described previously
[23], but suggest an increase in the distribution range of P.
variegata eastward to include new regions of the Ukraine,
Turkey and Russia. To date, autochthonous transmission
of T. callipaeda in Europe has been limited to a single
haplotype (h1), in contrast there are at least twenty add-
itional haplotypes present in southeast Asia [18, 38, 39].
Recent phylogenetic analysis of T. callipaeda isolates iden-
tified a divergence between European h1 and those haplo-
types present in Asian countries during the Pleistocene
epoch, suggesting two separate sub-populations [39]. The
presence of just a single haplotype in Europe may be the
result of either a specific genetic adaption of T. callipaeda
h1 which enables its survival and propagation in Europe,
or an indication that its spread in Europe was the result of
a single introduction of T. callipaeda h1 to the continent.
If the latter is true, expansion of P. variegata range
eastward increases the likelihood of further introductions
of T. callipaeda from Asia, including new haplotypes with
unknown consequences for the biology and epidemiology
of T. callipaeda in Europe, specifically its prevalence,
incidence and zoonotic potential.

GARP model analysis suggests the most suitable areas
for P. variegata in the UK are in southeast England. In
many instances these regions intersect with national
parks such as the New Forest, Windsor Forest, Wye
Valley, South Downs and parts of the Kent Downs; many
of these locations are popular areas for dog walking.
This scenario could bring competent definitive and
intermediate hosts of T. callipaeda into close proximity.
If dogs infected with T. callipaeda as a result of travel to
endemic European regions are exercised in such areas,
autochthonous transmission to P. variegata in the UK is
a possibility. Furthermore, such national parks are home
to numerous sylvatic species (e.g. red foxes, hares and
rabbits) which are themselves competent definitive wild
hosts for T. callipaeda [1, 40]. This readily available
wildlife reservoir further increases the possibility of T.
callipaeda becoming established in the UK.
The single male P. variegata specimen collected was
not infected with T. callipaeda. However, given that the
infection rate in P. variegata is ~1% under natural con-
ditions [21] the probability of detecting autochthonous
transmission by this method is very low. For surveillance
purposes, a more realistic approach would be to pas-
sively monitor T. callipaeda infection in sylvatic species
in regions where P. variegata presence is already known.
Overlaying the UK map as a layer in Google Earth
Pro® allowed the identification of potential P. variegata
sites by locating areas of woodland within these hotspot
areas [36]. This approach demonstrates a major advan-
tage of ecological niche modelling, since it facilitates a
more targeted approach to both field sampling for P.
variegata and surveillance for autochthonous T. calli-
paeda transmission. Whilst we were unable to confirm
P. variegata presence in locations predicted by the new
GARP model, we were able to identify habitat suitable
for the species, specifically extensive Quercus spp. wood-
land. The inclement weather conditions (Table 1) and
relative lateness in the season for sampling may have
hindered our detection of P. variegata even if they were
present. Further field sampling at such sites in summer
months would help establish the presence or absence of
P. variegata more definitively. Additional observations
could then be incorporated into updated versions of the
UK GARP model for P. variegata distribution to im-
prove its accuracy, or derive risk maps on a per month
basis.
The vector competence of P. variegata from geograph-
ical areas where T. callipaeda is not yet present, such as
the USA, has been recently demonstrated under labora-
tory conditions [41], confirming the potential for au-
tochthonous transmission in areas where the parasite is
not endemic but the vector occurs, such as the UK. We
have confirmed that, under favourable climatic condi-
tions, adult P. variegata were still active in the UK in
the last week of August. Falk [25] noted previously that
P. variegata activity in the UK was observed in June and
July, but that the full extent of their active flying season
was unknown. Current evidence would suggest an active
flying season in the south of the UK from May through
to September [25, 30]. Importantly, with respect to its
role as a vector of T. callipaeda, this would enable trans-
mission in the UK to occur within a single flying season,
since the minimum time required for development of
first-stage larvae to infective third-stage larvae is 14–21
days [22].
The ability of infected P. variegata to successfully
overwinter has been demonstrated experimentally [22].
Additionally, T. callipaeda L3 and L4 larvae recovered
from P. variegata and dogs, respectively, at the begin-
ning of the active flying season suggesting delayed trans-
mission to the following flying year is possible under
natural conditions [21]. In cooler northern latitudes the
ability of infected P. variegata to overwinter may prove
to be an important additional feature in determining
whether such fly populations are capable of sustaining
autochthonous transmission of T. callipaeda.
Conclusions
By updating and developing ecological niche models of
P. variegata distribution across Europe and the UK,
respectively, we have confirmed its predicted range and
indicate the potential for expansion to new regions. In
the UK, this has implications with respect to the poten-
tial for autochthonous transmission of T. callipaeda fol-
lowing its introduction from mainland Europe. Passive
surveillance of sylvatic species is suggested to monitor
for
autochthonous
T.
callipaeda
transmission.
In
addition, research to determine and improve the accur-
acy of GARP models and/or introduce temporal compo-
nents to consider seasonal and annual range variation
would further help monitor the distribution of P. varie-
gata and the subsequent risk of T. callipaeda infection
to both human and animal populations.
