Fine Tuning the Energy Barrier of 
Molecular Nanomagnets via Lattice 
Solvent Molecules
Cai-Ming Liu   , De-Qing Zhang & Dao-Ben Zhu
Solvents play important roles in our lives, they are also of interest in molecular materials, especially 
for molecular magnets. The solvatomagnetic effect is generally used for trigger and/or regulation 
of magnetic properties in molecule-based systems, however, molecular nanomagnets showing 
solvatomagnetic effects are very difficult to obtain. Here we report four 3d-4f heterometallic 
cluster complexes containing ROH lattice solvent molecules, [Cu3Tb2(H3L)2(OAc)2(hfac)4]∙2ROH 
{H6L = 1,3-Bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane, hfac− = hexafluoroacetylacetonate; 
R = CH3, 1; R = C2H5, 2; R = C3H7, 3; R = H, 4}. Single-molecule magnet (SMM) properties of these four 
complexes were observed to be dependent on the ROH lattice solvent molecule. There is an interesting 
magneto-structural correlation: the larger the R group, the higher the energy barrier. For the first 
time, the solvatomagnetic effect is used for the continuous fine adjustment of the energy barrier of 
0D molecular nanomagnets. Additionally, [Cu3Dy2(H3L)2(OAc)2(hfac)4]∙2MeOH (5), an analogue of 
[Cu3Tb2(H3L)2(OAc)2(hfac)4]∙2MeOH (1), is also reported for comparison.
Solvents, especially water, are critical to the origins of life, and they have penetrated into all aspects of human life. 
Besides as reaction mediums and extracting agents, chemical solvents are also of interest in molecular materials. 
For example, in the field of molecular magnets they can be utilized as the terminal ligand to complete the coordi-
nation configuration1–4; and they can also serve as guest or lattice molecules to adjust magnetic properties5–9. The 
solvatomagnetic effect is very interesting because solvent molecules can be used for trigger and/or regulation of 
magnetic properties while the molecular magnetic structure is always maintained. Therefore, molecular magnets 
showing solvatomagnetic effects can be used as molecule devices, molecular switches and/or molecular sensors. 
Naturally, solvatomagnetic effects are often found in porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) in which solvent 
molecules are guest molecules5–9, while low-dimensional systems with solvatomagnetic effects are more difficult 
to obtain due to the lack of pores. Recently, we found a chain-like azido-bridged manganese(III) coordination 
polymer showing both solvatomagnetic effect and spin-glass behaviour10. In studies of single molecule magnets 
(SMMs)11, we also hope to explore SMM systems with solvatomagnetic effects. However, it is a great challenging 
task because most SMMs reported are concentrated on zero-dimensional (0 D) cluster or mononuclear systems.
It is well known that SMMs are of great potential for technological applications in high-density information 
storage, quantum computing and spintronics12–17; and the energy barrier leading to magnetic bistability and slow 
magnetic relaxation is a pivotal parameter. Therefore, except enhancing the relaxation energy barrier and increas-
ing the blocking temperature18–21, tuning the relaxation energy barrier is another important target in the molec-
ular nanomagnet field22–26. Surprisingly, systematic studies of SMMs with the same magnetic structure are still 
rare, however, some factors such as the electron-withdrawing effect27, the electrostatic potential of the key coor-
dination atom28 have been observed to be able to modulate SMMs’ energy barriers recently. Regarding structures 
and magnetic properties may be affected by a small change of circumstance, solvent molecules may also be used 
to adjust SMMs’ properties. To the best of our knowledge, a direct correlation between energy barriers and dif-
ferent lattice solvent molecules of 0D molecular nanomagnets has never been documented, though a 3D Dy(III) 
MOF-type SMM was found to show an obvious solvatomagnetic effect in 201529, and guest-dependent single-ion 
magnet behaviours were observed in a 2D cobalt(II) coordination polymer in 201630. Herein we describe the 
lattice-solvent effect of ROH molecules (R = CH3, 1; R = C2H5, 2; R = C3H7, 3; R = H, 4) on the energy barrier

of 0D SMMs with the same magnetic structure [Cu3Tb2(H3L)2(OAc)2(hfac)4] {H6L = 1,3-Bis[tris(hydroxymet
hyl)methylamino]propane, Fig. 1; hfac− = hexafluoroacetylacetonate}. Fine adjustment of the energy barrier 
(from 25.7 K to 33.1 K, Hdc = 0 Oe) in this [Cu3Tb2(H3L)2(OAc)2(hfac)4] SMM system was achieved by changing 
the ROH lattice solvent molecule. A similar [Cu3Dy2(H3L)2(OAc)2(hfac)4] SMM system was also studied, but only 
the crystal structure of [Cu3Dy2(H3L)2(OAc)2(hfac)4]∙2MeOH (5) was successfully solved; complex 5 also exhibits 
slow magnetic relaxation under zero dc field, with the energy barrier of 30.0 K, a relatively high value for reported 
relaxation barriers of the Cu-Dy heterometallic SMMs.
Results and Discussion
Preparation. 
Bis-tris propane (H6L), an universal ligand due to flexible polydentate coordination sites, 
has been used to bind not only 3d transition metal ions31,32 but also 4 f lanthanide metal ions33. Furthermore, 
it can also be utilized to construct 3d-4f heterometallic complexes34. Recently, Murrie et al. reported a series 
of 3d-4f complexes formulated as {Ln2Cu3(H3L)2Xn} (X = OAc−, Ln = Gd, Tb or X = NO3
−, Ln = Gd, Tb, 
Dy, Ho, Er)35; they found that changing the auxiliary ligand OAc− through NO3
− may lead to a remarkable 
improvement of the energy barrier of {Tb2Cu3(H3L)2Xn} (X = OAc− and NO3
−) complexes, which suggests 
that the anion co-ligand has a great impact on the energy barrier of {Tb2Cu3(H3L)2Xn} SMMs. In the recent 
process of pursuing new SMMs, we observed that using Ln(OAc)(hfac)2(H2O)2 as the lanthanide (III) salt 
source may lead mixed co-ligands OAc− and hfac− into 3d-4f heterometallic clusters effectively36. Therefore, 
we adopted this synthesis strategy to obtain the [Cu3Tb2(H3L)2(OAc)2(hfac)4] SMM with different ROH lat-
tice solvent molecules (methanol, ethanol and isopropyl alcohol), in which not only the OAc− anion but 
also the hfac− anion are co-ligands. Notably, our synthetic procedures were completed at room temperature 
rather than at 60 °C used by Murrie group35. Products using methanol, ethanol and isopropyl alcohol as reac-
tion solvents were [Cu3Tb2(H3L)2(OAc)2(hfac)4]∙2MeOH (1), [Cu3Tb2(H3L)2(OAc)2(hfac)4]∙2EtOH (2) and 
[Cu3Tb2(H3L)2(OAc)2(hfac)4]∙2iso-C3H7OH (3), respectively; while [Cu3Tb2(H3L)2(OAc)2(hfac)4]∙2H2O (4) was 
quantitatively transformed from complex 1 by taking place of methanol molecules with water molecules. In order 
to yield [Cu3Tb2(H3L)2(OAc)2(hfac)4] SMMs with larger ROH lattice solvent molecules, other ROH solvents such 
as isobutyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol and isoamyl alcohol were also used instead of methanol for 1, but no any 
crystalline products could be obtained. Furthermore, the [Cu3Dy2(H3L)2(OAc)2(hfac)4] SMM system was also 
explored, but only the crystal structure of [Cu3Dy2(H3L)2(OAc)2(hfac)4]∙2MeOH (5) was successfully solved, the 
crystal structure of [Cu3Dy2(H3L)2(OAc)2(hfac)4] SMMs with other lattice solvent molecules (H2O, ethanol and 
isopropyl alcohol) could not be obtained due to the severe twinning phenomenon.
Structural description. 
All [Cu3Tb2(H3L)2(OAc)2(hfac)4]∙2ROH SMMs have the main structure 
[Cu3Tb2(H3L)2(OAc)2(hfac)4] (Fig. 2). Therefore, the structure of [Cu3Tb2(H3L)2(OAc)2(hfac)4]∙2MeOH (1) is 
chose to be described in detail. In the main structure [Cu3Tb2(H3L)2(OAc)2(hfac)4], a {Cu3(H3L)2} linear unit is 
formed through bridging two terminal {Cu(H3L)}− fragments using a central Cu2+ ion, then two Tb3+ ions link 
to this {Cu3(H3L)2} linear unit in the opposite direction, in which each Tb3+ ion connects with the central Cu2+ 
ion and one external Cu2+ ion through sharing one μ3-O atom and one μ-O atom from one H3L3− ligand, and one 
μ3-O atom from the other H3L3− ligand (Fig. 2a), similar to those in {Ln2Cu3(H3L)2Xn}35. The eight-coordinate 
sphere of each Tb3+ ion is finally completed by two hfac− anions and one OAc− anion. Shape software37 was 
adopted to calculate the Tb(III) coordination polyhedron, giving a triangular dodecahedron as the most likely 
configuration for complex 1, and the deviation value from the ideal D2d symmetry is 1.015 (Table S1, SI). It is 
worth noting that the Tb(III) coordination polyhedron can also be viewed as a biaugmented trigonal prism, but 
with the deviation value of 1.756 from the ideal D2d symmetry. Moreover, the calculation result for the Tb(III) 
coordination polyhedra of complexes 2–4 using Shape software37 are listed in Tables S2–S4 (SI), respectively.
The external Cu atom, in a distorted square-pyramidal configuration, is coordinated with two N atoms and 
two μ-O atoms from one H3L3− ligand, forming the base of the pyramid; whereas the third μ-O atom from the 
same H3L3− ligand occupying the apical site. The central Cu2+ ion is coordinated by two μ3-O atoms and four μ-O 
atoms from two H3L3− ligands, generating a distorted octahedral geometry, in which two μ-O atoms bridging the 
central Cu atom and the external Cu atom are in the Jahn-Teller axis’ direction, with the long Cu-O bond distance 
of 2.665 Å for complex 1.
There are hydrogen bonds between the methanol O atom and the carboxylate O atom with the Omethanol…
Ocarboxylate distance of 2.803 Å and between the methanol O atom and the N atom from the H3L3− ligand with the 
Omethanol…N distance of 2.937 Å for complex 1. Similar hydrogen bonds were observed between the ethanol O

atom and the carboxylate O atom with the Oethanol…Ocarboxylate distance of 2.788 Å and between the ethanol O atom 
and the N atom from the H3L3− ligand with the Oethanol…N distance of 2.941 Å for 2; between the isopropyl alco-
hol O atom and the carboxylate O atom with the Oisopropyl alcohol…Ocarboxylate distance of 2.817 Å and between the 
isopropyl alcohol O atom and the N atom from the H3L3− ligand with the Oisopropyl alcohol…N distance of 2.922 Å 
for 3; and between the water O atom and the carboxylate O atom with the Owater…Ocarboxylate distance of 2.866 Å 
and between the water O atom and the N atom from the H3L3− ligand with the Owater…N distance of 2.944 Å for 
4. These weak intermolecular interactions play important roles in not only stabilization of crystal structures but 
also adjustment of magnetic properties for complexes 1–4.
Complex 5 has the same structure as 1, but Dy instead of Tb is used (Fig. S1, SI). The Dy-O bond distance 
(average 2.357 Å) in 5 is slightly smaller than the Tb-O bond length (average 2.368 Å) in 1 owing to the lanthanide 
contraction effect. The Dy(III) coordination polyhedron can also be described as a triangular dodecahedron with 
the deviation value of 0.975 from the ideal D2d symmetry (Table S5, SI). This value is a little smaller than that of 
1 (1.015), indicating that the Dy(III) coordination polyhedron in 5 is closer to a triangular dodecahedron than 
the Tb(III) coordination polyhedron in 1. The deviation value from the ideal D2d symmetry for a biaugmented 
trigonal prism is 1.735 for 5, also a little smaller than that of 1 (1.756). Similar to 1, there are also hydrogen bonds 
between the methanol O atom and the carboxylate O atom with the Omethanol…Ocarboxylate distance of 2.796 Å and 
between the methanol O atom and the N atom from the H3L3− ligand with the Omethanol…N distance of 2.937 Å 
for complex 5.
Magnetic properties. 
The direct current (dc) variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility of complexes 1–
4 was measured at 1000 Oe applied field (Fig. 3). The room temperature χT values of the complexes 1 (24.91 cm3 K 
mol−1), 2 (24.85 cm3 K mol−1), 3 (24.84 cm3 K mol−1) and 4 (24.90 cm3 K mol−1) are slightly larger than the theo-
retical value of 24.77 cm3 K mol−1 for three noninteracting Cu2+ ions (g = 2.0) and two uncoupled Tb3+ ions (7F6, 
J = 6, L = 3, S = 3, g = 3/2). As shown in Fig. 3, upon cooling, the χT product almost keeps a constant value or just 
slightly lowers; however, below about 50 K, a rapid rise appears until reaches the maximum values of 53.92 cm3 K 
mol−1 at 6.0 K for 1, 45.14 cm3 K mol−1 at 4.0 K for 2 and 49.80 cm3 K mol−1 at 4.0 K for 3; the χT values then 
decline to 49.34 cm3 K mol−1 at 2.0 K for 1, 43.48 cm3 K mol−1 at 2.0 K for 2 and 47.48 cm3 K mol−1 at 2.0 K for 
3. Exceptionally, complex 4 does not reach the maximum value until 2.0 K (44.60 cm3 K mol−1). These magnetic 
behaviours are very similar to those of {Tb2Cu3(H3L)2Xn} (X = OAc− and NO3
−)35, suggesting that all four com-
plexes are also ferromagnetic. The small difference in dc magnetic susceptibilities of 1–4 means that there is 
a solvatomagnetic effect in this [Cu3Tb2(H3L)2(OAc)2(hfac)4] SMM system.

The solvatomagnetic effect could also be detected by alternating current (ac) magnetic susceptibility inves-
tigations. Both the in-phase (χ′, Fig. S2, SI) and the out-of-phase (χ′′, Fig. 4) of variable-temperature ac mag-
netic susceptibility for 1–4 are frequency-dependent in zero dc field, indicating slow magnetic relaxation 
typical for SMMs. Such thermally induced relaxation was fitted with the Arrhenius law, τ = τ0exp(Ueff/kT), 
extracting Ueff/k values of 30.0(0.4) K for 1, 32.4(0.2) K for 2, 33.1(0.7) K for 3 and 25.7(0.2) K for 4 as well 
as τ0 values of 3.7(0.2) × 10−8 s for 1, 6.2(0.1) × 10−9 s for 2, 2.6(0.3) × 10−8 s for 3 and 2.3(0.1) × 10−8 s for 
4 (Fig. 5a). All four τ0 values are within the normal range for SMMs/SIMs (10−5–10−11 s)13. A comparison of 
the effective barrier value for complexes 1–4 with the R group of the ROH lattice solvent molecules (R = H, 
4; R = CH3, 1; R = C2H5, 2 and R = C3H7, 3) reveals an important magneto-structural correlation for this 
[Cu3Tb2(H3L)2(OAc)2(hfac)4] SMM system: The larger the R group in ROH, the higher the energy barrier of the 
[Cu3Tb2(H3L)2(OAc)2(hfac)4]∙2ROH SMM (Fig. 5b). It is noteworthy that either the Ueff/k value of 2 or the Ueff/k 
value of 3 is one of the largest values so far for the Cu-Tb heterometallic SMMs in zero dc field, just smaller than

that of (NMe4)2[Tb2Cu3(H3L)2(NO3)7(CH3OH)2](NO3) (36 K)35; the Ueff/k value of 1 is also remarkable, which 
is comparable with that of [Cu2(valpn)2Tb2(N3)6]·2CH3OH [H2valpn = 1,3-propanediylbis(2-iminomethylene
-6-methoxyphenol)] (30.1 K, Hdc = 0 Oe)38. In many cases39–44, a dc field is necessary for 3d-4f heterometallic 
complexes to display magnetic relaxation because of the obvious quantum-tunnelling effects.
Simplified theoretical investigations by Murrie group suggested that the magnetic bistability in the 
[Cu3Tb2(H3L)2Xn] system is not because of single-ion behaviours, and both the Cu···Cu and Cu···Tb ferromag-
netic interactions maybe quench the tunnel splitting, which are similar to acting as an internal applied field, 
inducing to zero-field SMM behaviours35. Nevertheless, the difference of the Tb3+ coordination configurations 
has influence on the SMM characteristics35. Owing to great difficulty for theoretical calculation and comparison 
of the Cu···Cu and Cu···Tb ferromagnetic couplings35, we tried to make a magneto-structural correlation for 
complexes 1–4 using the deviation value from the ideal D2d symmetry of the biaugmented trigonal prism for the 
Tb3+ ion and the intermolecular distance as two main structural parameters. As shown in Table 1, the coordina-
tion configuration of the Tb3+ ions is closer to the biaugmented trigonal prism from 1 to 3, the corresponding 
energy barrier value becomes larger from 1 to 3, indicating the biaugmented trigonal prism configuration in the 
[Cu3Tb2(H3L)2(OAc)2(hfac)4] SMM system is the dominant configuration; but 4 is a bit unusual, its deviation 
value (1.735) is comparable with that of 1 (1.756), which suggests that other structural factors such as intermolec-
ular distances need to be considered; as shown in Table 1, the longer the intermolecular distance (defined by the 
shortest Cucentral…Cucentral separation), the higher the energy barrier; which is in line with the magneto-structural 
correlation using the R group itself, because larger ROH lattice solvent molecules may enhance intermolecular 
distances correspondingly.
The SMM properties of 1–4 were also evaluated by the parameter Φ = (ΔTf/Tf)/Δ(logf)45, where f represents 
the frequency and Tf the peak temperature of χ″ curve; the Φ values of 1, 2, 3 and 4 are 0.18, 0.17, 0.17 and 0.21, 
respectively, which support the superparamagnet behaviour of these SMMs (Φ > 0.1), but exclude any spin glass 
properties (Φ ≈ 0.01)45. Further determinations of ac magnetic susceptibility revealed that the variable-frequency 
χ″ signals of 1–4 are evidently temperature-dependent (Fig. 6), confirming slow magnetic relaxation of SMMs. 
The χ″ vs χ′ plots show classical half-circular curves for all four complexes, indicating a single magnetic relaxa-
tion process (Fig. S3, SI). These Cole-Cole plots could be fitted with a generalized Debye model46,47. The α values 
are smaller than 0.07 for 2–4, suggesting a single relaxation mechanism; while the α values for 1 are from 0.10 to 
0.22, indicating a relatively narrow distribution of the relaxation time. In addition, no any hysteresis was observed 
in the M vs H plot at 1.9 K for 1–4 (Fig. S4, SI).
The χT value at room temperature for complex 5 is 29.44 cm3 K mol−1 (Fig. 7a), which is in good agreement 
with the expected value of 29.47 cm3 K mol−1 for three uncoupled Cu2+ ions (g = 2.0) and two isolated Dy3+ ions 
(6H15/2, J = 15/2, S = 5/2, L = 5, g = 4/3). When temperature is decreased, the χT product decreases very slowly 
until 110 K (29.20 cm3 K mol−1), then increases very gently until about 50 K. Below this temperature, the χT value 
rises rapidly, reaching the maximum of 63.92 cm3 K mol−1 at 5 K and then dropping down to 62.38 cm3 K mol−1 at 
2 K, these magnetic behaviors are similar to those for 1 and (NMe4)2{Dy2Cu3(NO3)7(CH3OH)2](NO3)35, and the 
ferromagnetic coupling obviously exists between the Cu2+ ion and the Dy3+ ion as well as among the Cu2+ ions, 
similar to that observed in [Gd2Cu3(H3L)2(CH3COO)6]·THF·3H2O by Murrie group35.

The magnetization dynamics of compound 5 are similar to those of complexes 1–4. Under zero dc field, 
the appearance of frequency-dependent χ′ (Fig. S5, SI) and χ″ signals (Fig. 7b) indicates SMM behaviors of 5. 
The SMM parameters extracted from the Arrhenius law for 5 are Ueff/k = 30.0(0.2) K and τ0 = 9.7(0.1) × 10−9 
s (Fig. 7c). The energy barrier value of 5 is comparable with that of 1, but obviously larger than that of 
(NMe4)2{Dy2Cu3(H3L)2(NO3)7(CH3OH)2](NO3) [23.9(0.1) K], whose χ″ signals even do not appear peaks in 
zero dc field35. Notably, this Ueff/k value is the third high value for the Cu-Dy heterometallic SMMs, after 47 K 
of [{Dy(hfac)3}2{Cu(dpk)2}] (dpk− = di-2-pyridyl ketoximate)48 and 41.6 K of [Cu4Dy4(vanox)6(Hvanox)2(NO3)4 
(μ-HOMe)2]·6MeOH (H2vanox = 3-methoxy-2-hydroxybenzaldoxime)49. Furthermore, this Ueff/k value is 
remarkable larger than those of the Cu-Dy heterometallic SMMs with higher nucleus (<20 K)50,51. Additionally, 
the parameter Φ value of 0.16 for 5 supports the SMM nature too.
The variable-frequency ac magnetic susceptibility study of 5 revealed that the χ″ signals of 5 are 
temperature-dependent (Fig. 7d), confirming the SMM behavior of 5. The Cole-Cole plots were fitted to a gen-
eralized Debye model (Fig. S6, SI)46,47, giving the α values of 0.01–0.08 for 5, suggesting the magnetic relaxation 
happens via a single relaxation process. Additionally, the M vs H plot of 5 shows no any hysteresis at 1.9 K (Fig. S7, 
SI).
Conclusions
In summary, a mixed OAc−/hfac− co-ligands’ synthesis strategy was adopted to prepare 3d-4f heterometallic 
SMMs based on the 1,3-Bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane ligand (H6L). The ROH lattice solvent 
molecules (R = H, CH3, C2H5 and C3H7) in the [Cu3Tb2(H3L)2(OAc)2(hfac)4] SMM system have great influ-
ences on the energy barrier; the larger the R group, the higher the energy barrier. We predict that the larger 
ROH molecule may enlarge the intermolecular distance and can help to change the coordination configura-
tion of the Ln(III) ions through the hydrogen bonding interaction between the ROH lattice solvent molecule 
and the [Cu3Tb2(H3L)2(OAc)2(hfac)4] main-structural molecule. Our work demonstrates that solvatomagnetic 
effects can be used to continuously fine-tune energy barriers in SMMs. The discovery is bound to have signifi-
cances in enhancing and turning energy barriers of molecular nanomagnets via chemical methods such as using 
lattice-solvent effects.

Synthesis of [Cu3Tb2(H3L)2(OAc)2(hfac)4]∙2MeOH (1). 
To a mixture of H6L (0.25 mmol) and 
Cu(ClO4)2·6H2O (0.375 mmol) in 20 mL of MeOH, was added Tb(OAc)(hfac)2(H2O)2 (0.15 mmol), a blue solu-

A single crystal with dimensions 0.261 × 0.093 × 0.025 mm3 of 1, 0.178 × 0.063 ×  
0.024 mm3 of 2, 0.183 × 0.125 × 0.031 mm3 of 3, 0.108 × 0.067 × 0.025 mm3 of 4, and 0.134 × 0.125 × 0.027 mm3 of 
5 was picked out to mount on a Bruker SMART APEX-CCD diffractometer with Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) 
for data collection at 173(2) K. Empirical absorption corrections from ϕ and ω scan were applied. Cell parame-
ters were calculated by the global refinement of the positions of all collected reflections for five complexes. The 
structures were solved by direct methods and refined by a full matrix least-squares technique based on F2 using 
with the SHELX-2014 program package. All hydrogen atoms were set in calculated positions and refined as riding 
atoms, and all non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. CCDC 1574978–1574982 contain the supple-
mentary crystallographic data, which can be obtained free of charge from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data 
Centre via www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/data_request/cif.
