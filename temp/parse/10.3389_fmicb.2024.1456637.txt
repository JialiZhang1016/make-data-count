Escherichia albertii is an emerging foodborne pathogen. We previously reported
that some avian Shiga toxin-producing E. albertii strains exhibited higher or
comparable cytotoxicity in Vero-d2EGFP cells with several enterohemorrhagic
E. coli (EHEC) outbreak strains. To better understand the environmental
persistence of this pathogen, comparative genomics and phenotypic assays
were applied to assess adhesion capability, motility, and bioﬁlm formation in
E. albertii. Among the 108 adherence-related genes, those involved in biogenesis
of curli ﬁmbriae, hemorrhagic E. coli pilus, type 1 ﬁmbriae, and Sfm ﬁmbriae
were conserved in E. albertii. All 20 E. albertii strains carried a complete set of
primary ﬂagellar genes that were organized into four gene clusters, while ﬁve
strains possessed genes related to the secondary ﬂagella, also known as lateral
ﬂagella. Compared to EHEC strain EDL933, the eight chemotaxis genes located
within the primary ﬂagellar gene clusters were deleted in E. albertii. Additional
deletion of motility genes ﬂhABCD and motBC was identiﬁed in several E. albertii
strains. Swimming motility was detected in three strains when grown in LB
medium, however, when grown in 5% TSB or in the pond water-supplemented
with 10% pigeon droppings, an additional four strains became motile. Although
all E. albertii strains carried curli genes, curli ﬁmbriae were detected only in
four, eight, and nine strains following 24, 48, and 120 h incubation, respectively.
Type 1 ﬁmbriae were undetectable in any of the strains grown at 37◦C or 28◦C.
Strong bioﬁlms were detected in strains that produced curli ﬁmbriae and in
a chicken isolate that was curli ﬁmbriae negative but carried genes encoding
adhesive ﬁmbriae K88, a signature of enterotoxigenic E. coli strains causing
neonatal diarrhea in piglets. In all phenotypic traits examined, no correlation
was revealed between the strains isolated from different sources, or between
the strains with and without Shiga toxin genes. The phenotypic variations could
not be explained solely by the genetic diversity or the difference in adherence
genes repertoire, implying complex regulation in expression of various adhesins.
Strains that exhibited a high level of cytotoxicity and were also proﬁcient in
bioﬁlm production, may have potential to emerge into high-risk pathogens.

1 Introduction
Escherichia albertii, an emerging foodborne pathogen, is the
most divergent lineage among the other Escherichia species
and clades (Walk et al., 2009; Ooka et al., 2015). Due to
similar biochemical properties and possession of the intimin gene
located on the locus of enterocyte eﬀacement (LEE) pathogenicity
island, many E. albertii isolates have been misidentiﬁed as
enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), or enterohemorrhagic E. coli
(EHEC) (Ooka et al., 2012). E. albertii causes diarrhea, abdominal
pain, and high fever in humans, although bacteremia and
extraintestinal infections were also reported (Gomes et al., 2020).
The well-known virulence factors in E. albertii include LEE
encoded intimin and its Tir receptor, responsible for the initial
adherence of pathogen cells to the host epithelial cell surfaces,
as well as the LEE-encoded type three secretion system (T3SS)
and the eﬀector proteins. Other common virulence factors include
Shiga toxin (Stx), cytolethal distending toxin (CDT), type six
secretion systems (T6SS), and the vacuolating autotransporter
toxin Vat (Carter et al., 2023a). Sporadic infections and outbreaks
of foodborne gastroenteritis caused by E. albertii have been
reported worldwide (Konno et al., 2012; Ooka et al., 2013; Ori
et al., 2018; Masuda et al., 2020; Bengtsson et al., 2023; Iguchi
et al., 2023). Transmission of E. albertii is thought to occur
via contaminated food or water although in most outbreaks the
transmission vehicles were not identiﬁed (Masuda et al., 2020;
Muchaamba et al., 2022).
Growing evidence supports that E. albertii has a wide habitat
range. E. albertii strains have been isolated from domestic and wild
animals, various foods, and aquatic environments (Muchaamba
et al., 2022). Among the reported animal hosts, birds appear to be
one of the main reservoirs/carriers (Oaks et al., 2010; Hinenoya
et al., 2021; Hinenoya et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Barmettler
et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2024). Presence of E. albertii in various
water bodies and food products including chicken, pork, duck
meat, mutton, and oysters has been reported (Felfoldi et al., 2010;
Maheux et al., 2014; Lindsey et al., 2015; Maeda et al., 2015; Wang
et al., 2016; Arai et al., 2022), however, little is known about
the contamination routes and the environmental prevalence and
persistence of this emerging foodborne pathogen. A recent study
investigating the survival of E. albertii in foods and water revealed
that E. albertii grew faster in chicken than in pork or in oysters but
had low viability in warm environmental water (Hirose et al., 2024).
Induction of ﬂagellar biosynthesis and swimming motility was
observed in some strains when cells were exposed to hypoosmotic
pressure or at ambient temperature, suggesting a role of ﬂagellar
motility in the survival of E. albertii in aquatic environments
(Ikeda et al., 2020).
Bioﬁlm
is
a
common
microbial
lifestyle
in
natural
environments (Watnick and Kolter, 2000). Compared with
planktonic cells, bioﬁlm-associated cells are better at coping
with environmental stresses and have increased resistance to
toxic substances including antibiotics and chemical sanitizers.
Therefore, bioﬁlm formation by enteropathogenic bacteria would
increase their survival and persistence in natural environments and
may serve as a source of contamination. Bioﬁlm formation
involves
multiple
steps,
including
initial
surface
contact,
transient association, attachment, maturation, and dispersion
(O’Toole et al., 2000).
Numerous
bacterial
adherence
factors
including
surface
adhesive
appendages
and
autotransporter
proteins play a role in bioﬁlm formation. In E. coli K-12 strains,
ﬂagellar motility, curli ﬁmbriae, as well as FimH adhesin were
found to be important for initial surface contact and attachment.
Additionally, ﬂagellar motility was found playing a role in
bioﬁlm dispersion (Pratt and Kolter, 1998; Reisner et al., 2003;
Karatan and Watnick, 2009).
Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) produces diverse ﬁmbrial
and nonﬁmbrial adhesins that facilitate the attachment to
and/or colonization by STEC cells in diverse ecological niches
(McWilliams and Torres, 2014; Vogeleer et al., 2014). In STEC
O157:H7 strains, curli ﬁmbriae were found to mediate binding
to, and invasion of epithelial cells, and promote the attachment
of pathogens to plant and abiotic surfaces (Gophna et al.,
2001; Fink et al., 2012; Carter et al., 2016). The hemorrhagic
E. coli pilus (HCP), originally identiﬁed in STEC O157:H7 as a
colonization factor (Xicohtencatl-Cortes et al., 2007), contributed
to the bioﬁlm formation of STEC O157:H7 strains on abiotic
surfaces (Xicohtencatl-Cortes et al., 2009). In E. coli and other
enteric pathogens, expression of type 1 ﬁmbriae is controlled by a
phase variation mechanism, which reversibly switches between the
“ON” and “OFF” state of ﬁm genes transcription (Abraham et al.,
1985). This switch is mediated by an invertible DNA element, ﬁmS,
and two site-speciﬁc recombinases. Inversion of ﬁmS abolishes the
transcription of ﬁmA, which encodes the major subunit of type
1 ﬁmbriae. Expression of type 1 ﬁmbriae were detected in STEC
non-O157 strains, but not in O157:H7 strains (Roe et al., 2001). In
STEC O157:H7 strains, transcription of ﬁmA is locked at the “OFF”
state due to a 16-bp deletion within the ﬁmS (Iida et al., 2001).
Type 1 ﬁmbriae contributed to the attachment of STEC cells to
abiotic surfaces in a O128:H2 strain and contributed to the bioﬁlm
formation when the ﬁm genes of the STEC O157:H7 strain Sakai
were expressed in a nonpathogenic E. coli strain (Cookson et al.,
2002; Elpers and Hensel, 2020).
Knowledge about environmental persistence of E. alberti is
scarce. Bioﬁlm formation by E. albertii was reported in only a few
clinical strains at 37◦C although the eﬃciency of bioﬁlm formation
was much lower than that of E. coli strain 042 (Lima et al., 2019).
Understanding prevalence and persistence of E. albertii in nonhost
environments will provide valuable information for risk assessment
and to bridge gaps in understanding the epidemiology of this
emerging human pathogen. We previously reported genomic
features and virulence genes repertoire of Shiga toxin-producing
E. albertii strains isolated from wild birds in an agricultural region
in California and revealed that some bird strains exhibited higher
or comparable cytotoxicity with several EHEC outbreak strains
(Carter et al., 2023a). To gain insight into the persistence of
E. albertii in nonhost environments, we systematically evaluated
the adhesion capability and several phenotypic traits known to
contribute to bacterial bioﬁlm formation in a set of E. albertii avian
and clinical strains. Our study revealed great genetic diversity in
genes encoding ﬁmbrial and nonﬁmbrial adhesins in E. albertii
as well as vast strain variations in expression of curli ﬁmbriae,
swimming motility, and in bioﬁlm formation. Our study provides a
foundation into further understanding how E. albertii senses and
responds to environmental stimuli for improved survival in the
changing environments.

2 Materials and methods
2.1 Bacterial strains and growth media
Bacterial strains and their sources are listed in Table 1. The
complete genome sequences of E. albertii strains were reported
previously (Carter et al., 2023a). The strains were grown routinely
in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (10 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, and 5 g
NaCl per liter) unless noted.
2.2 Sequence analysis
The ﬂagellar genes in E. albertii strains were identiﬁed by
using BLASTn searches with the ﬂagellar genes of the E. coli K-12
sub-strain MG1655 and the EHEC strain EDL933 (Supplementary
Table 1). Additional ﬂagellar genes were identiﬁed from the
E. albertii genome annotations as described previously (Carter
et al., 2023a) (Supplementary Table 2). E. coli genes related to
ﬁmbriae and pili biogenesis and genes encoding protein adhesins
(Supplementary Table 3) were used as queries of BLASTn to
identify homologs of adherence-related genomic loci in E. albertii
strains. The BLASTn was performed in Geneious Prime
R⃝with a
threshold of 65% for gene coverage and 70% or 25% for sequence
identity at nucleotides or amino acids level, respectively. Homologs
of each gene or the entire operons were extracted from the
corresponding bacterial genomes. DNA sequences were aligned
using Clustal Omega in Geneious Prime
R⃝(2024.0.3) and neighbor-
joining consensus trees were constructed with the following
parameters: Genetic Distance Model, Jukes-Cantor; Resampling
Method, bootstrap; and number of replicates, 10,000.
2.3 Motility tests
Swimming motility was examined for each strain grown
on soft agar (0.25%) in rich medium (LB), diluted TSB (5%),
and sterile pond water containing 10% pigeon droppings as
described previously (Murakami et al., 2020) with modiﬁcation.
The pond water was collected from a public accessible creek
in Albany, California (37◦53′43.86′′N, 122◦18′16.68′′W). The
pigeon droppings were collected near a train station in El
Cerrito, California (37◦54′9.63′′N, 122◦17′56.17′′W). To prepare
the 10% pigeon-droppings suspension, pigeon droppings were
ﬁrst suspended in nine volumes of pond water and then ﬁltered
through a 0.22-µm ﬁlter followed by adding agar to 0.25% prior
to autoclaving. Single colonies of each E. albertii strain were point-
inoculated on soft agar plates using sterile toothpicks. The plates
were incubated at 30◦C for three days prior to observing the
motility.
2.4 Detection of curli ﬁmbriae
Curli ﬁmbriae were examined by growing each strain at 26◦C
for 1, 2, and 5 days on Congo Red indicator (CRI) plates,
consisting of LB agar plates without sodium chloride (LBNS) and
supplemented with 40 µg/ml of Congo Red dye and 10 µg/ml of
Coomassie Brilliant Blue, as described previously (Carter et al.,
2011). Curli-producing strains were indicated by red colonies
whereas curli-deﬁcient strains were indicated by white colonies on
CRI plates.
2.5 Detection of type 1 ﬁmbriae
Production
of
type
1
ﬁmbriae
was
examined
by
hemagglutination for each strain grown in LBHS broth statically at
37◦C or in LBNS broth statically at 28◦C for two days. Cells were
collected by centrifugation at 8,000 g for 3 min and resuspended in
1x PBS buﬀer at a ﬁnal concentration about 3 x 108 cells/ml. Fifty
µl of bacterial suspension was then mixed with 50 µl of guinea pig
red blood cells (Innovative Research Inc) at room temperature in
the presence or absence of 1% D mannose as previously described
(Biscola et al., 2011). E. coli strain DH5a was used as a positive
control and EHEC strain EDL933 was used as a negative control.
2.6 Bioﬁlm formation and quantiﬁcation
Bioﬁlm assays were carried out as described previously (Carter
et al., 2023b). Brieﬂy, overnight cultures of E. albertii grown in LB
at 37◦C were inoculated in LBNS broth at a ﬁnal concentration of
1x106 cells/ml. One ml of inoculated LBNS broth was aliquoted
into a borosilicate glass tube and then incubated statically at 28◦C
for 1, 2, and 5 days. At the end of each incubation, the planktonic
cells were removed carefully, and the tubes were rinsed twice with
one ml sterile distilled water and then stained with one ml 0.1%
crystal violet at room temperature for 30 min. The dye was then
removed gently, and the tubes were washed twice with sterile
distilled water. The crystal violet that bound to the glass tube
was solubilized in 0.5 ml of 33% acetic acid and the absorbance
was determined at 570 nm using a microplate reader (SpectraMax
340; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Tubes with uninoculated
media served as negative controls. Each data set was the average of
results from at least three biological replicates. All data were ﬁrst
evaluated for normal distribution by the Shapiro-Wilk test using
Graph Pad Prism 10 Version 10.2.3 (Dotmatics). The diﬀerences
in bioﬁlm formation, represented by the absorbance at 570 nm,
among the strains were assessed by the adjusted P-value of the
Tukey’s multiple comparisons test after a One-way ANOVA test
(P ≤0.05). Similarly, the diﬀerences in bioﬁlm formation of each
strain at various incubation times were assessed by the adjusted
P-value of the Tukey’s multiple comparisons test after a One-way
ANOVA test.
3 Results
3.1 E. albertii ﬂagellar genes
Of the 48 genes related to ﬂagella biosynthesis and motility
in strain EDL933, homologs of 40 and 35 genes were identiﬁed
in 13 and seven E. albertii strains, respectively (Supplementary
Table 1). In strain EDL933, these 48 ﬂagellar genes are distributed
Frontiers in Microbiology
03
frontiersin.org
Carter et al.
10.3389/fmicb.2024.1456637
at four genomic locations, with a size of 11.5 Kb, 15.6 Kb, 6.7 Kb,
and 11.0 Kb for Regions 1–4, respectively. Examining the genomic
locations of the ﬂagellar genes in E. albertii revealed a similar genes
organization as in strain EDL933 (Figure 1A). Among the four
genomic locations, the greatest sequence variation was detected
in Region 2. In strain EDL933, Region 2 contained seven ﬂagellar
genes and eight chemotaxis genes (cheZYBR, tap, tar, and cheWA).
Unlike strain EDL933, the eight chemotaxis genes were deleted in
all E. albertii strains examined. Furthermore, an additional deletion
of genes ﬂhBCD and motBA was detected in a subset of E. albertii
strains including ﬁve avian and two clinical strains. This deletion
appeared to be mediated by a recombination between the sites
within genes ﬂhA and otsA since a 183-bp otsA gene fragment
was located immediately upstream of a truncated ﬂhA gene. In
contrast, the ﬂagellar genes located in the other three regions in
strain EDL933 were all conserved in E. albertii strains.
Interestingly, a Flag-2 locus, which encodes a secondary
ﬂagellar system that resembles the lateral ﬂagella in Aeromonas
hydrophila and Vibrio parahaemolyticus (Ren et al., 2005), was
identiﬁed in one avian (RM9973) and four clinical E. albertii strains.
The Flag-2 loci in E. albertii varied in size from 33 Kb in the
clinical strain 2010C-3449 to 44 Kb in the clinical strain 05-3106.
Like the Flag-2 locus in the enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) strain
042, Flag-2 genes were organized into three gene clusters, separated
by the two variable regions, VR1 and VR2 (Figure 1B). In strain
042, the ﬁrst gene cluster contains 14 genes that are involved
in regulation and expression of ﬂagellar basal body components.
Homologs of these 14 genes were detected in the avian strain
RM9973 and in the clinical strain 05-3106. Genes lfhB and lﬁR were
deleted in the strain 07-3866, while genes lafK and lﬁEFGHIJ were
deleted in both strains 54-2045 and 2010C-3449 (Supplementary
Table 2). The second gene cluster in strain 042 also contains 14
genes encoding ﬂagellar structural proteins and the third gene
cluster carries nine genes that are mainly involved in ﬂagellar
ﬁlament synthesis. Homologs of all genes within the second and the
third gene clusters were detected in the Flag-2 positive E. albertii
strains. In the Flag-2 negative E. albertii strains, this region was
about 2.5 Kb, containing the truncated two border genes, ﬂhA
and lafU (Figure 1B). A highly similar truncated Flag-2 locus was
detected in E. coli strains EDL933 and K-12 strain MG1655 (%
Identity > 90).
3.2 Motility in E. albertii
When grown in LB at 30◦C for three days, motility was
observed in two avian strains, RM10507 and RM10705, and
one clinical strain 07-3866 (Table 1). Both strains RM10507 and
RM10705 were isolated from brown-headed cowbird and were
Flag-2 negative. These three strains remained motile when grown in
5% TSB or in pond water supplemented with 10% pigeon droppings
(Table 1). Interestingly, four nonmotile strains when grown in
LB, became motile when grown in 5% TSB or in the pond water
supplemented with 10% pigeon droppings (Table 1). These four
strains included two avian strains, RM9973 and RM9976 that were
both isolated from American crow, the chicken isolate 2014C-
4356, and the clinical strain 05-3106. The majority of nonmotile
phenotypes could be explained by the mutations identiﬁed in the
ﬂagellar genes, including the deletion of motAB and ﬂhBCD in
avian strains RM15112-RM15116 and in clinical strains 2014C-
4015 and 2014EL-1348 (Figure 1B), point deletions in ﬂiF of the
strains RM9974 and 2011C-4180 and in motA of the strain 2013C-
4143, and an amber mutation in ﬂgG and ﬂhA of the strains 54-2045
and 2010C-3449, respectively (Supplementary Table 1).
3.3 E. albertii ﬁmbrial genes
Homologs of genes encoding 12 ﬁmbriae and pili implicated in
adherence, bioﬁlm formation, and pathogenesis in diverse E. coli
pathotypes were examined in E. albertii. All genes are listed in
Supplementary Table 3. Homologs of genes encoding curli ﬁmbriae,
type 1 ﬁmbriae, and hemorrhagic E. coli pilus (HCP) were detected
in all strains while homologs of genes encoding adhesive ﬁmbriae,
Sfm ﬁmbriae, and P ﬁmbriae were detected in a subset of E. albertii
strains examined.
3.3.1 Curli genes and expression of curli ﬁmbriae
Like E. coli, genes related to biogenesis of curli ﬁmbriae in
E. albertii are organized in two divergent operons, csgDEFG and
csgBAC, and located upstream of tRNA gene serX (Figure 2A).
Sequence analysis revealed that all E. albertii curli genes were placed
in the same clade that was separated from the E. coli curli genes
(Figure 2B). The curli genes of the E. albertii strains shared a high
sequence similarity ( > 95%) with each other, except for the clinical
strain 2010C-3449, in which, both csgE and csgD were truncated
due to an IS insertion, while csgA carried an amber mutation.
Unexpectedly, production of curli ﬁmbriae varied greatly
among the E. albertii strains (Figure 2C). Among the 10 avian
strains, production of curli ﬁmbriae was observed in strains
RM9973, RM9974, RM9976 and RM10705, although all avian
strains carried intact coding sequences for all curli genes. As
expected, no curli ﬁmbriae were observed for clinical strain 2010C-
3449. Among the other clinical strains, production of curli ﬁmbriae
was detected in three out of four stx2f positive strains (2012EL-
1823B, 2014C-4015, 2014EL-1348) and in the stx2f negative strain
07-3866. Colonies of strain 2013C-4143 exhibited pink and light red
color following 48 h and 120 h incubation, respectively, suggesting
that this strain could produce curli ﬁmbriae under the condition
examined but with less amount compared with the other curli-
positive strains (Figure 2C).
3.3.2 Type 1 ﬁmbriae genes and expression of
type 1 ﬁmbriae
In E. coli, the type 1 ﬁmbriae genes (ﬁmB, ﬁmE, and
ﬁmAICDFGH) are located on an 8.8-Kb DNA fragment. Expression
of the type 1 ﬁmbriae is controlled by a phase variation
mechanism, in which, transcription of ﬁmA is switched to “ON”
or “OFF” by an invertible DNA element, ﬁmS, and two site-
speciﬁc recombinases encoded by genes ﬁmB and ﬁmE, respectively
(Figure 3A). Homologs of the nine ﬁm genes were identiﬁed in all
20 E. albertii strains examined. Additionally, the invertible element,
ﬁmS, ﬂanked by two 9-bp inverted repeats (IRs), was also detected
in all E. albertii strains. The IRs (5′-TTGGGGCCA-3′) in E. albertii
strains were identical to the IRs in E. coli strains EDL933 and K-
12 strain MG1655, except for the avian strain RM9973, in which a
single base substitution of G to A occurred at position 6.

corresponding chromosomal positions of the four ﬂagellar gene clusters in E. coli O157:H7 strain EDL933 and E. albertii avian strains RM9973 and
RM15112. Green arrows represent the ﬂagellar genes detected in E. albertii and grey arrows represent the bordering genes or the hypothetical genes.
Yellow arrows represent E. coli genes that are missing in E. albertii strains. (B) Gene organization and genomic locations of the secondary ﬂagellar
genes (Flag-2). Numbers indicate the corresponding chromosomal positions in EAEC strain 042 and avian strain RM9973. The three ﬂagellar gene
clusters are indicated by the red arrows. In the strains lacking a Flag-2, such as EDL933 and RM9974, the corresponding chromosomal sites were
uniformly occupied by the two truncated genes, ﬂhA and lafU. Genes labeled with an “*” indicate those carrying mutations within the coding
sequences.
Expression of type 1 ﬁmbriae in E. coli O157:H7 strains
including EDL933 is silenced due to a 16 bp deletion in ﬁmS (Roe
et al., 2001). This deletion locks the transcription of ﬁmA at the
“OFF” orientation. Comparative analyses of E. albertii ﬁmS genes
with the EDL933 ﬁmS revealed an intact ﬁmS in E. albertii strains,
like the ﬁmS in E. coli K-12 strain MG1655 (Figure 3B). Sequence
analyses of other ﬁm genes placed all E. albertii strains in the same
clade, separated from the ﬁm genes in the E. coli strains (Figure 3C).
Various mutations including point deletions and IS insertions were
revealed in the ﬁmA, ﬁmC, and ﬁmD genes of clinical strain 2010C-
3449, the ﬁmD of the clinical strain 54-2045, and the ﬁmI of the
clinical strain 2013C-4143 (Supplementary Table 3).
However, a mannose-sensitive hemagglutination assay failed to
detect type 1 ﬁmbriae in any of the 20 E. albertii strains examined
when they were grown in LBHS at 37◦C or in LBNS at 28◦C, like
strain EDL933. Production of type 1 ﬁmbriae was detected in E. coli
DH5a cells under both testing conditions.
3.3.3 Other ﬁmbriae genes
Homologs of genes encoding hemorrhagic E. coli pilus
(hcpABC) were identiﬁed in all 20 E. albertii strains, and mutations
in hcpB (annotated as gspE in E. albertii), encoding the type II
secretion system protein GspE, were present in seven out of the
20 strains examined (Supplementary Table 3). Similarly, homologs
of genes encoding the Sfm ﬁmbriae (sfmACDHF and sfmZ) were
identiﬁed in the 18 out of the 20 strains examined. Mutations
were most common in sfmD, encoding a ﬁmbrial biogenesis usher
protein (Supplementary Table 3). In the clinical strains 54-2045
and 2010C-3449, only a homolog of sfmA was present. Among the
adhesive ﬁmbriae genes examined, homologs of cfaABCD genes,
which are often present on the chromosomes of EHEC strains,
were identiﬁed in 10 out of the 14 stx2f -positive E. albertii strains,
while homologs of faeCDEFGHIJ genes, which are often present
on the plasmids of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) strains, were
identiﬁed in the clinical strain 07-3866 and in the chicken isolate
2014C-4356 (Supplementary Table 3). In E. coli, there are 12
genes (papXGFEKJDCHABI) related to biogenesis of P ﬁmbriae.
Homologs of seven genes, papEKJDCHA, were identiﬁed in seven
out of the 20 E. albertii strains, homologs of ﬁve genes, papJDCHA,
were identiﬁed in the chicken isolate 2014C-4356, and homologs of
four genes, papDCHA, were identiﬁed in the clinical strain 2012EL-
1823B.

(Supplementary Table 3). paa encodes an AcfC family adhesin.
A homolog of paa was present in nearly all E. albertii strains
examined and exhibited > 80% sequence identity with the paa
gene in EHEC strain EDL933. The gene ehaC encodes an AIDA-I
family autotransporter adhesin. A homolog of ehaC was detected
in all E. albertii strains examined, although a point deletion and a
point insertion were present in the avian strain RM10705 and the
clinical strain 2010C-3449, respectively (Supplementary Table 3).
The E. albertii ehaC genes exhibited ∼75% sequence identity with
the ehaC gene in strain EDL933. eaeH encodes an intimin-like
adhesin FdeC. A distant homolog (∼80% length in CDS and 27.6%
identity in amino acids) was identiﬁed in all E. albertii strains
examined, although mutations were detected in the clinical strain
2011C-4180 (IS insertion), and avian strains RM10507 (Insertion
of 5’-GTCTG-3’) and RM10705 (a point deletion). A homolog of
ehaB, ranging in size from 2430 bp to 2979 bp was detected in
E. albertii strains. Interestingly, the ehaB genes in avian strains
RM9973 and RM9976, and in clinical strains 05-3106, 54-2045, and
2014C-4356, displayed higher sequence similarity with the EDL933
ehaB gene compared with the ehaB genes in other E. albertii strains.
The gene sinH, encoding an intimin-like inverse autotransporter,
was present in all E. albertii strains examined. In fact, the gene
sinH appeared to be widespread in E. albertii but only present in a
subset of E. coli strains. Homologs of sinH were not identiﬁed in
EHEC strain EDL933.
3.5 Bioﬁlm formation
Following the initial 24 h incubation, a visible ring was observed
for avian strain RM9974 and four clinical strains, 2012EL-1823B,

of the curli genes between the E. albertii avian strain RM9973 and E. coli O157:H7 strain EDL933. Numbers indicate the corresponding chromosomal
positions in each strain. Green arrows represent the annotated genes, and the pink arrows represents tRNA gene serX. (B) Sequence analysis of curli
genes. The curli operons were identiﬁed by BLASTn search of a database containing all genomes examined using a 4.4-Kb DNA fragment containing
the seven curli genes of the E. coli strain MG1655 as a query in Geneious Prime R⃝. The sequences of the curli genes were extracted from
corresponding genomes and aligned using Clustal Omega alignment in Geneious Prime R⃝. A consensus tree was constructed with the following
parameters: Genetic Distance Model, Jukes-Cantor; Resampling tree method: Bootstrap; Number of Replicates: 10,000; Support Threshold: 50%.
The stx2f positive strains are indicated in parentheses. The strain marked with an “*” indicates presence of mutations within the coding sequences of
curli genes. (C) Detection of curli ﬁmbriae on CRI plates. Curli ﬁmbriae were examined by growing each strain on the CRI plates at 26◦C for 24 h,
48 h, and 120 h. Production of curli ﬁmbriae is indicated by red colonies which resulted from the binding of CR dye supplemented in growth
medium.

visible bioﬁlms at 48 h, strain 2014C-4356 produced a considerable
amount of biomass on the glass surface following 120 h incubation
(Figure 4A). Among the strains that produced bioﬁlms following
48 h incubation, a signiﬁcant increase in attached biomass was
observed for all strains following 120 h incubation (One-way
ANOVA, adjust P < 0.05) (Figure 4D). At 120 h post inoculation,
quantitative analysis revealed that avian strain RM9974, chicken
isolate 2014C-4356 along with the clinical strain 2014C-4015 were
the strongest bioﬁlm producers, followed by the clinical strains
2014EL-1348 and 2012EL-1823B, and the avian strain RM9973,
which all produced signiﬁcantly greater amounts of bioﬁlm than
the clinical strain 07-3866 (One-Way ANOVA, adjust P < 0.05).
For avian strains RM9976 and RM10705, although a visible ring
was detected on glass surfaces, they were not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
from those of non-bioﬁlm producing strains (Figure 4D).
4 Discussion
Flagellar motility allows bacteria to move rapidly towards
nutrients and away from toxic substances, thus it plays an
essential role in bacteria to explore new niches and to establish
colonization. Moreover, ﬂagella also serve as a virulence factor in
many enteric pathogens, contributing to adhesion, invasion, and
host colonization (Moens and Vanderleyden, 1996; Colin et al.,
2021). In E. coli, nearly 50 genes are involved in ﬂagella assembly
and function. Expression of the ﬂagellar genes is tightly regulated
by a three-tiered transcriptional hierarchy to ensure production
of ﬂagellum at the right time and under the applicable conditions
(Khan et al., 2020). The group I genes, ﬂhDC, encode the master
transcriptional regulator FlhDC that activates the expression of
the group II genes. In E. coli, there are nearly 30 genes belonging
to the group II and many of these genes encode components
of the ﬂagellum basal body and hook and the sigma factor 28
FliA. FliA regulates the expression of group III genes, which
are involved in synthesis of complete ﬂagellum and chemotaxis
systems. The regulation of ﬂagellar gene expression in E. albertii
is unknown, although a similar hierarchical regulation fashion is
expected considering the close phylogenetic relationship between
the two species. Originally, E. albertii was thought nonmotile and
lacked ﬂagella although 74% E. albertii strains were reported to
carry a complete set of ﬂagellar biosynthesis genes (Abbott et al.,
2003; Ooka et al., 2015). Induction of ﬂagellar motility by low
osmotic pressure was observed in 27 out of the 59 E. albertii
strains tested (Ikeda et al., 2020); similarly, induction of swimming
motility by nutrients derived from pigeon droppings was observed
in six out of the 12 strains examined (Murakami et al., 2020),
implying strain variation in expression of ﬂagellar motility in
E. albertii. Consistently, our study revealed great diversity in
ﬂagellar genes repertoire and conditionally expressing swimming
motility in E. albertii. Among the 20 E. albertii strains examined,
three were motile regardless of the growth conditions, while four
were motile only when grown in pond water supplemented with
pigeon droppings or in the diluted TSB medium. Deletion of a
large DNA fragment containing genes ﬂhAB, motBA, and ﬂhCD
is likely the molecular basis of nonmotile phenotypes observed
in ﬁve avian and two clinical strains. Furthermore, a loss-of-
function mutation in genes ﬂiC, ﬂiF, ﬂiJ, ﬂgD, ﬂgG, ﬂhA, and motA
may explain some but not all non-motile phenotypes observed in
our study. Considering the highly complex regulation in ﬂagellar
gene expression, comparative transcriptomic studies may provide
insight into the molecular basis of the strain variation in expression
of ﬂagellar motility.
Our study revealed the presence of the Flag-2 locus in
E. albertii. The Flag-2 locus appears to be widespread among
the Enterobacterales (De Maayer et al., 2020) and serve as
a hot spot for gene insertions and deletions. Consistently,
great sequence variation was observed among the ﬁve Flag-2
loci identiﬁed, including large deletions, point mutations and
transposon insertions. However, several VR1 genes that are
predicated on having a role in posttranslational regulation of
ﬂagellar biosynthesis are conserved in E. albertii, including the
glycosyltransferase gene and the lysine-N-methylase gene. Unlike
the primary ﬂagellar system, the function of the Flag-2 locus is
not fully understood. Expression of Flag-2 genes was observed
in Yersinia enterocolitica with a maximal level at 20◦C and, in
Plesiomonas shigelloides, the Flag-2 locus encoded lateral ﬂagella
appeared to be essential for swarming motility (Bresolin et al., 2008;
Merino et al., 2015). Systematic analyses of cargo genes located in
the VR2 in Flag-2 loci suggested a role in secretion of virulence
factor and in inter-bacterial competition (De Maayer et al., 2020).
Searching other E. albertii genomes deposited in public databases
as of April 2024 revealed that about 25% of genomes carry a Flag-2
locus. Additional studies are needed to elucidate any physiological
roles or ecological beneﬁts conferred by this secondary ﬂagellar
system in E. albertii.
Among the 12 ﬁmbriae/pili that are commonly present in
E. coli, genes encoding curli ﬁmbriae, hemorrhagic E. coli pilus,
type 1 ﬁmbriae, and Sfm ﬁmbriae were identiﬁed in most of the
E. albertii strains examined, while genes related to biogenesis of
adhesive ﬁmbriae, or P ﬁmbriae were only present in a subset of
strains. Curli, also known as bacterial amyloid, is an important
colonization factor involved in initial surface attachment, bioﬁlm
formation, and induction of the host inﬂammatory response
(Barnhart and Chapman, 2006). Although 19 out of the 20
E. albertii strains examined in our study carried intact curli genes,
production of curli ﬁmbriae was detected in only nine strains. This
strain variation could not be explained solely by the diﬀerences
in the coding sequences of the curli genes or the diﬀerences in
the intergenic regions between the two curli operons, including
the promoters of csgD and csgB, since some curli-deﬁcient strains
shared the identical intergenic sequences with the curli expressing
strains (Data not shown). Strain variation in curli production
were reported in E. coli and Salmonella enterica (Romling et al.,
1998; Dyer et al., 2007), which both have served as the model
organisms for studying curli biogenesis and regulation. In both
E. coli and S. enterica, expression of curli is regulated by a complex
regulation network involving multiple transcriptional regulators,
two-component regulatory systems, and in some isolates cyclic
dinucleotide 3’,5’-cyclic di-GMP (Barnhart and Chapman, 2006;
Blomﬁeld and van der Woude, 2007). Therefore, mutations in
any of these regulators or the target sequences that interact with
the regulators directly or indirectly could have an impact on the
expression of curli ﬁmbriae. For example, mutations in genes
encoding the transcriptional regulators rpoS or rcsB were reported
to be the molecular bases of strain variation in curli production
in EHEC O157:H7 (Carter et al., 2012; Carter et al., 2014) and

mutations in the csgD promoter could lead to overproduction of
curli ﬁmbriae (Uhlich et al., 2002). Knowledge about the regulation
of curli ﬁmbriae in E. albertii is limited. Examining genes encoding
putative transcriptional regulators of the curli genes in E. albertii
revealed a loss-of-function mutation in the rpoS gene in strains
05-3106 and 54-2045, while no mutations were identiﬁed in genes
encoding Crl, MlrA, CpxRA, OmpR-EnvZ, or RcsBC. Additional
studies are required to gain a comprehensive understanding of curli
regulation network in E. albertii as well as the environmental and
physiological signals that may induce or repress the expression of
curli ﬁmbriae.
Although the majority of E. albertii strains examined in our
study carried functional ﬁm genes and an intact ﬁmS, none of
them displayed a mannose-sensitive hemagglutination (MSHA)
phenotype under the growth conditions examined. Expression of
type 1 ﬁmbriae was reported to be dependent on the growth
conditions. For example, optimal production of a predominantly
type 1 ﬁmbriae positive population in Shigella required serial
passage every 48 to 72 h in unshaken brain heart infusion broth
at 37◦C (Snellings et al., 1997). Since the goal of our study
was to reveal if the type 1 ﬁmbriae contributed to the bioﬁlm
formation in E. albertii, the conditions tested for production of
type 1 ﬁmbriae were the conditions used for examining bioﬁlm
formation, which may not be optimal for expression of type 1
ﬁmbriae. Additionally, the phase variation of type 1 ﬁmbriation is
regulated at multiple levels. In E. coli, switch of ﬁmS is required
but not suﬃcient for biosynthesis of type 1 ﬁmbriae. Besides
FimB and FimE, other transcriptional regulators including IHF,
Lrp, and H-NS were reported to be involved in ﬁmS switch
(Blomﬁeld and van der Woude, 2007). Variations in the activities
of FimB and FimE, cross talks between ﬁmbrial operons, as
well as the presence of other recombinases can all contribute
to variation in expression of type 1 ﬁmbriae. Additional studies
are required to understand growth conditions, physiological cues,
and environmental signals for induction of type 1 ﬁmbriae in
E. albertii.
Among the nonﬁmbrial adhesins examined, genes encoding
the autotransporter (AT) adhesins were predominant in E. albertii.
For example, homologs of ehaA, ehaB, ehaC, and upaH that
all encode an AIDA-I type autotransporter (AT) adhesin were
identiﬁed in all or most of the strains examined and a homolog
of ehaG, encoding a trimeric AT adhesin was identiﬁed in all
strains. Other AIDA-1 type adhesins genes in E. albertii included
aatA, aidA, agn43, and cah. In E. coli, Ag43 is the most prevalent
AIDA-1 type AT adhesin, however, in E. albertii, the agn43 was
identiﬁed only in a clinical strain. Other commonly detected
non-ﬁmbrial adhesin genes were eaeH, paa, and sinH. The gene
eaeH encodes an intimin-like adhesin that facilitates adhesion of
bacterial cells, delivery of heat-labile toxin, and colonization of
the small intestine in ETEC (Sheikh et al., 2014). The gene paa,
encoding an AcfC family adhesin, is widespread in both EHEC and
ETEC strains. Paa contributes to the formation of A/E lesions in
animal hosts and thus is an important virulence factor in various
E. coli pathotypes (An et al., 1999; Batisson et al., 2003). The
paa gene appears to be widespread in E. albertii and in some
strains, there are two paa loci, including the bird strains isolated
in Poland (BioSample numbers: SAMN33094111, SAMN33094114,
SAMN33094099, SAMN33094102, and SAMN33094112), and a
poultry strain isolated in China (SAMN17525956). The gene
sinH encodes an intimin-like inverse autotransporter. The inverse
autotransporters were reported to play a role in bioﬁlm formation
in E. coli and contributed to bioﬁlm formation and virulence
in Yersinia ruckeri (Martinez-Gil et al., 2017; Goh et al.,
2019; Wrobel et al., 2020). However, deletion of sinH in the
UPEC strain CFT073 did not impact the bioﬁlm formation
signiﬁcantly, rather, the mutant displayed a signiﬁcant ﬁtness
reduction during UTI in a murine model (Shea et al., 2022).
Like paa, sinH appears to be conserved in E. albertii. BLASTn
search of additional 57 complete E. albertii genomes deposited
in GenBank as of April 2024 identiﬁed a sinH in all of
them.
Like curli production, E. albertii strains diﬀered greatly in
bioﬁlm formation on glass surfaces. Consistent with our previous
report that, in STEC, curli ﬁmbriae are important for bioﬁlm
formation on abiotic surfaces (Carter et al., 2016; Carter et al.,
2019), all curli-producing E. albertii strains produced moderate
or strong bioﬁlms under the condition examined. Interestingly,
some curli-positive strains produced visible bioﬁlm following a 24-
h incubation, while others did not produce bioﬁlms until a 120-h
incubation, implying a diﬀerence in bioﬁlm development among
the E. albertii strains. Furthermore, although no curli ﬁmbriae
were detected in chicken isolate 2014C-4356, strong bioﬁlms were
observed on day 5 of incubation, suggesting a role of other adhesins
in bioﬁlm formation. Strains 2014C-4356 and 07-3866 were the
only strains carrying genes encoding the adhesive ﬁmbriae that
are located on a large plasmid commonly found in ETEC strains,
such as pUMNK88_Hly (GenBank accession # NC_017643.1). It
requires further investigation to determine if the plasmid-borne
adhesive ﬁmbriae are expressed in E. albertii and whether it
contributes to bioﬁlm formation in strains that do not produce curli
ﬁmbriae.
Bioﬁlms of foodborne pathogens can enhance their survival
and persistence in diverse ecological niches and serve as sources of
contamination in food production environments and of infection
in health-care environments. Adhesion is the ﬁrst step in bioﬁlm
development and in establishing colonization in animal hosts.
Strong adherence often implies enhanced surface attachment and
bioﬁlm formation, leading to increased ﬁtness and pathogenic
potential. Therefore, understanding the adhesion capability and
the underlining factors in E. albertii would provide valuable
information for development of eﬀective control strategies. Our
study revealed that curli ﬁmbriae, Type 1 ﬁmbriae, Sfm ﬁmbriae,
and HCP appear to be the common ﬁmbrial adhesins in
E. albertii, while adhesive ﬁmbriae was a strain-speciﬁc trait.
Among the numerous nonﬁmbrial adhesins identiﬁed in E. albertii,
autotransporter adhesins EhaA, EhaB, EhaC, EhaG, and SinH,
and the adherence factors EaeH and Paa are common, while
Agn43, Cah, and Iha that are widespread in E. coli, are only
associated with a few strains. E. albertii strains carry diﬀerent
combinations of ﬁmbrial and nonﬁmbrial adhesins that may
facilitate colonization of E. albertii in diverse niches. Our study
further revealed great variations in expression of curli ﬁmbriae
and in bioﬁlm production, suggesting complex regulation in
expression of adhesins in E. albertii. Studies are needed to identify
environmental cues that induce the adhesions expression and the
receptors speciﬁcally interacted with each adhesin to gain insight
into molecular basis of niche selection for E. albertii, an emerging
human and avian pathogen.
