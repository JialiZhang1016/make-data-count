Abstract 
A fragmentation model based on global load sharing (GLS) theory is developed to obtain stress-strain curves 
that describe the mechanical behavior of unidirectional composites. The model is named 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶+ 𝜏𝜏∗ because 
it is based on the Critical Number of Breaks model (CNB) and on the correction of the fiber matrix interfacial 
strength, 𝜏𝜏∗. Model allows both obtaining the ultimate tensile strength of CFRP and GFRP composites, and 
correcting the 𝜎𝜎 vs 𝜀𝜀 curve to match its peak point with the predicted strength, which is more accurate than 
the one obtained by previous GLS-based models. Our model is used to classify the mechanical response of the 
material according to the energetic contributions of two phenomena up to the failure: intact fibers (IF) and 
fragmentation (FM). Additionally, the influence of fiber content, 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓, on the tensile strength, 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈, failure strain, 
𝜀𝜀𝑈𝑈, and total strain energy, 𝑈𝑈𝑇𝑇, is analyzed by means of novel mechanical-performance maps obtained by the 
model. The maps show a dissimilar behavior of 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈, 𝜀𝜀𝑈𝑈 and 𝑈𝑈𝑇𝑇 with 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓 between GFRP and CFRP composites. 
The low influence of 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓 on the percent energetic contributions of IF and FM zones, as well as the larger 
energetic contribution of the FM zone, are common conclusions that can be addressed for both kinds of 
composites.

1 INTRODUCTION 
Most of the analytical models used to predict the mechanical behavior of unidirectional composite materials 
consider the stochastic representation of the occurrence of fiber breakings. They are based on the fragmentation theory 
and global load sharing (GLS) approach, and can be considered useful tools to assist the mechanical design of composite 
materials (Lamon 2010). Fragmentation modeling is critical for the determination of the mechanical response of 
composite materials, as well as for the estimation of the stress-strain response (Lamon 2010). Curtin was the first to 
develop a law of fragmentation from an expansion of Taylor series that allow approximating the Weibull function, 
obtaining analytical solutions for the curve σ vs ε (Curtin 1991a, 1991b). This model was later extended by Neumeister 
to roughly explain the superposition of the zones of influence adjacent to the fiber breaks (Neumeister 1993a, 1993b). 
On the other hand, Hui et al. (Hui et al. 1995) obtained the governing equations for a problem of fiber fragmentation,

however, these cannot be solved analytically, and can only be evaluated numerically. In addition, Turon et al. developed 
a progressive damage model for unidirectional composite laminates, capable of accounting for the loss of stiffness due 
to the separation of the reinforcement on the vicinity of the fiber rupture (Turon et al. 2005). The main differences 
between these works lie in the consideration or not of phenomena such as fiber pull-out, sliding, fiber separation and/or 
the distribution of the global or local load after breakage, which entail different mathematical complexity. Consequently, 
the mentioned models show moderate differences in the relation σ vs ε before the peak point of the curve, and important 
dissimilarities from that point onwards. 
The model developed by Neumeister includes a refined constitutive law to predict the tensile behavior of brittle 
materials in terms of a damage variable, without solving differential equations or evaluating auxiliary functions 
numerically (Neumeister 1993a). The Neumeister model has several similarities with the work done by Curtin (Curtin 
1991a, 1991b), however, Neumeister model is much simpler and can offer a more accurate solution (Neumeister 1993a).

where 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓 is the fiber volume content and 𝑤𝑤 is a damage variable that depends on the fiber stress, 𝜎𝜎𝑓𝑓 , the critical stress, 
𝜎𝜎𝑐𝑐, and the Weibull modulus, 𝛽𝛽, as given by:

Even though the stress-strain behavior predicted by GLS-based models reasonably agrees with experimental tests 
for low density of fiber breaks, the ultimate tensile strength predicted by these models significantly differs from 
experimental values. In general, the GLS-based models considerably overpredict the tensile strength because they do 
not consider the stress concentration factor around the breaks (Swolfs et al. 2015). In general, when a fiber break occurs, 
the load released is redistributed among the intact adjacent fibers in order to obtain a local load equilibrium. The stress 
is intensified in the neighboring fibers, increasing their probability to fracture. The way in which the concentration factor 
that accounts for the stress redistribution in the fibers surrounding the break is computed determines the accuracy of 
the predicted strength. There exist some numerical models that consider the stress concentration around the broken 
fibers and are usually named Local Load Sharing (LLS) models (Beyerlein and Phoenix 1996b; Ibnabdeljalil and Curtin 
1997; Sastry and Phoenix 1993; Zhou and Curtin 1995). They make use of complex mathematical formulations (Harlow 
and Phoenix 1978a, 1978b) or numerical Monte-Carlo Simulations (Curtin and Takeda 1998a, 1998b; Landis, Beyerlein, 
and McMeeking 2000; Okabe et al. 2001), which increase the computational cost. Generally speaking, LLS models tend 
to underpredict the composite strength (Behzadi, Curtis, and Jones 2009). 
Accordingly, the traditional GLS-based models, as the Neumeister one, are very useful since they provide fast and 
accurate results about the stiffness of the composite in the linear elastic zone, but their main drawback lies in the over-
prediction of the ultimate tensile strength of the composite. Bearing this in mind, Koyanagi et al. (Koyanagi et al. 2009) 
presented the Simultaneous Fiber-Failure (SFF) model, which assumes that the unidirectional composite fails when a 
certain number of simultaneous fiber breaks, n, occur. This critical number of fiber breaks was estimated from the 
experimental strength of different composite materials. Then, for the composite materials considered, a 
phenomenological relationship was established between the fiber breaks, n, and the strength ratio, 𝜏𝜏ඥ𝜎𝜎0𝜎𝜎𝑚𝑚
⁄
, where 𝜏𝜏 
is the fiber-matrix interfacial strength, 𝜎𝜎0 is the characteristic stress of the Weibull distribution and 𝜎𝜎𝑚𝑚 is the strength of 
the matrix. Koyanagi et al. mixed different material systems such as glass and carbon fiber-reinforced polymeric 
composites (GFRP and CFRP, respectively), ceramic matrix composites (CMC), and carbon/carbon composites (C/C). 
Although their predictions of the ultimate tensile strength were reasonably accurate for C/C and CMC, the same 
conclusion could not be addressed for GFRP and CFRP. Thereby, it can be asserted that the Koyanagi’s GLS-based model 
is not particularly suitable for CFRP and GFRP composites. Recently, Lamus, Linero and Guevara presented a two-
dimensional numerical model able to describe the fracture process in structural members of steel fibre reinforced 
concrete (SFRC) in terms of the fiber volume ratio and the mechanical properties of the components (Augusto 2019). 
Mixture theory was used for the stress-strain relationship; concrete matrix was represented with a scalar damage 
constitutive model; one-dimensional plasticity constitutive model was employed for fibers and fiber-matrix interface; 
the jumps in the displacement field and corresponding non-bounded values of strains, which are associated to cracking, 
were represented using a Continuum Strong Discontinuity Approach; non-linear finite element analysis was implemented

to solve the governing equations of the model, and a bootstrap stochastic methodology was used to establish confidence 
intervals for the structural response considering that reinforcements are short fibers randomly oriented and distributed. 
The model can be considered suitable in the sense that most of experimental results of Load vs. Displacement for tensile 
and bending tests of SFRC beams lies in the predicted confidence intervals, but that model is not conceived to predict 
the exact mechanical response of continuous and oriented fiber-reinforced composites, as the one proposed here. 
Another work dealt with the toughening effect produced by the fibers at the early stage of a crack formation (Wang and 
Friedrich 2013), which consists on the increase of stress of fibers in the neighborhood of an initial crack in order to keep 
the two opening surfaces of the crack from separating. Influence of fiber strength, fiber-matrix interface resistance, fiber 
diameter and elasticity modulus on the percentage of effective fibers were evaluated, finding that the lower the elasticity 
modulus and the higher the fiber strength, the larger the toughening effect. Not quantitative comparison with 
experiments were carried out in that work since not experimental data of effective fibers around initial cracks are 
available in the literature. The mentioned work focused on the simulation of a phenomenon arising in the initial crack, 
i.e, toughening, but not on the whole damage process of the composite. 
Damage progression of composite materials can be considered by using macroscopic models as well. For instance, 
Ghannadpour and Shakeri used the Hashin failure criteria and proposed a material degradation model to predict the 
failure and progressive damage behavior of composites plates containing initial geometric imperfections, when subjected 
to in-plane compressive loads (Ghannadpour and Shakeri 2018). A collocation method was used by the authors, where 
domain was discretized with Legendre-Gauss-Lobato nodes and displacement field was approximated by Legendre Basis 
Functions. The ply-by-ply failure and damage progression of the laminate was estimated in that work, but the accuracy 
of the results showed to be very sensible to the plate thickness and area of region around the location of failure. 
Progressive failure and finite element methods have been combined in several works to predict the stress-strain behavior 
of composites structures at macroscopic level. Average stress-average strain curves for compressive loads have been 
obtained by these methods in stiffened curved panels using Tsai-Wu criterion (Chen and Guedes Soares 2007), grid 
stiffened composite plates/shells using modified Hashin criterion (Zhang, Chen, and Ye 2008) and laminated shell 
structures using the extended Hashin criterion (Wagner and Balzani 2010). In a similar fashion, Morshedsolouk and 
Khedmati obtained the average stress-average strain curves of composite ships’ stiffened panels to study the buckling 
and post-buckling behavior of these panels in terms of the aspect ratio, initial geometrical imperfection and stiffener 
size, using the Tsai-Wu failure criterion (Morshedsolouk and Khedmati 2014). These curves are very useful for 
comparative and parametric analysis purposes, but the predicted ultimate strength can considerably differ from 
experimental results since the phenomena involved in the damage process are not explicitly considered at microscopic 
level, as in the present work. In another work, the Extended Finite Element Method (XFEM) and 3D Puck´s failure theory 
were used to evaluate the crack evolution in thick composites structures (Angelo, Ribeiro, and Tita 2018), obtaining 
satisfactory results for thick laminated composites with layers oriented to 90˚ that undergo translaminar failure. In 
addition, compact tension tests with 0°, 90° and 45° specimens were evaluated, and numerical results were qualitatively 
coherent with experimental data. 
In a previous work (Vanegas-Jaramillo et al. 2018), we reformulated the Neumeister and Turon models, which are 
based on the Global Load Sharing approach, with the purpose to predict accurately the tensile strength of unidirectional 
composite materials in terms of the number of breaks per unit length, Λ. It was proposed that the failure of the composite 
occurs when a critical number of breaks per unit length is reached; this critical break density depends on the constituent 
properties and the fiber volume content of the composite. In the model, called the Critical Number of Break model (CNB), 
an empirical law for the critical number of breaks as a function of the overall fragmentation limit stress and the volumetric 
fiber content, was deduced taken into account data of carbon fiber and glass fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP and GFRP, 
respectively) obtained from the literature. The CNB model implied an improvement of the GLS-based fragmentation 
models, with the ability to predict accurately the tensile strength of CFRP and GFRP composites. In general, the peak 
point of the σ vs ε curves obtained by Neumeister and Turon models does not match with the tensile strength computed 
with CNB (see Figure 1). 
The value of tensile strength predicted by the CNB model is lower than the one obtained by the original Neumeister 
and Turon models, which implies that the overall stress-strain response of the composite should be different as well. In 
other words, the relocation of the failure point in the original Neumeister or Turon stress-strain curve, according to the 
value predicted by CNB, cannot be considered a satisfactory strategy since the stress-strain response is not fully linear 
up to failure, but instead, a non-linear response is appreciated at the end of the damage process due to the arising of the 
fiber fragmentation phenomenon (See Figure 1). The main purpose of the present work is to obtain stress-strain curves 
that describes more accurately the real behavior of the composite according to the tensile strength predicted by CNB. 
The effect of several micro-mechanical variables on the global stress-strain response is analyzed, finding that the

variation of the fiber-matrix interfacial strength, τ, allows ‘contracting’ or ‘expanding’ the curve keeping constant the 
initial slope (the Young modulus of the composite), which in turns entails the relocation of the peak point of the curve. 
A numerical procedure is developed to find the corrected fiber-matrix interfacial strength, 𝜏𝜏∗, that brings about a good 
agreement between the peak point of the curve σ vs ε and the ultimate tensile strength predicted by CNB.

CNB models 
On the other hand, in the present work, the process of damage of the composite is divided into different 
phenomena. At the beginning, the reinforcement offers a linear elastic behavior and the fibers are intact (IF). If the load 
is increased, the defects act as stress concentrators where cracks arise along the fibers, and this phenomenon is called 
fragmentation (FM). The fragmentation evolves until the crack saturation in the fibers occurs, moment from which the 
fibers cannot be longer fragmented, and the material starts developing the sliding/separation phenomenon (SS). In this 
work, it was estimated the energetic contribution of these phenomena in the curve 𝜎𝜎 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 𝜀𝜀 of both CFRP and GFRP 
composites. Results showed that the fragmentation phenomenon of the fibers (FM) has the largest energetic 
contribution during the damage process. In this point, it is worth-mentioning that previous works has introduced damage 
estimators as a function of the strain energy. For instance, Gillich et al. expressed the damage severity produced by cracks 
located in a cantilever, multi-layered beam as a function of the stored energy, in order to study the influence of the crack 
depth on the natural frequency ship at several longitudinal positions of the beam (Gillich et al. 2016). Accurate results 
were obtained in that work for some vibration modes when compared to experiments. In general, strain energy can be 
considered an acceptable parameter to account for the damage evolution; in the present case, it is used to discriminate 
the different phenomena involved in the stress-strain response of the composite, namely, linear elastic behavior (IF), 
fragmentation (FM) and sliding/separation (SS). 
In order to assist the design of structural composites, we propose mechanical-performance-maps that allow 
analyzing the influence of the fiber content, 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓, on the tensile strength, 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈, failure strain, 𝜀𝜀𝑈𝑈, and total strain energy, 𝑈𝑈𝑇𝑇, 
of the composite. In this way, by knowing the constituent properties of the CFRP and GPRP considered here, and the 
fiber volume content, 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓, these maps are useful to estimate the mechanical response of the material and classify the 
energetic contributions during the damage process. The fragmentation model proposed here is named 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶+ 𝜏𝜏∗, and 
can be considered a valuable tool to predict the stress-strain behavior of unidirectional composites with good accuracy. 
2 MODELING OF THE MECHANICAL RESPONSE 
2.1 Critical Number of Breaks Model (CNB) 
According to the Critical Number of Breaks model (CNB), the ultimate strength corresponds to a critical density of 
fiber breaks that are proper of the material (Vanegas-Jaramillo et al. 2018). Once this critical density of breaks has been 
reached, the fracture of the composite occurs; in this point, the interaction between fiber breaks becomes important 
enough to create ‘avalanche events’ of broken fibers that lead to the failure of the material. In the CNB model, it was 
introduced the overall fragmentation limit stress, 𝜎𝜎𝑐𝑐
′, which relates the constituent properties and the fiber volume

content of unidirectional composites. This stress 𝜎𝜎𝑐𝑐
′ can be defined as the remote stress that, on average, causes the 
crack saturation in all fibers of the composite. That is, once this stress level is reached, the composite is not able to 
develop further fragmentation, and other damage mechanisms, such as fiber sliding and separation, arise. Consequently, 
the critical number of breaks per unit length (ΛC) and the overall fragmentation limit stress (𝜎𝜎𝐶𝐶
′) correspond to the same 
loading state of the composite, i.e., the moment where the fiber fragmentation stops. In a previous work (Vanegas-
Jaramillo et al. 2018), for a set of ten different materials, it was shown that the behavior of ΛC with 𝜎𝜎𝐶𝐶
′ is different 
between CFRP and GFRP composites. For CFRP, ΛC increases with 𝜎𝜎𝐶𝐶
′, whereas for GFRP composites, this decreases. In 
that study, it was obtained a fitting relationship between these two variables, ΛC and 𝜎𝜎𝐶𝐶
′, as given by: 
ΛC = 𝑒𝑒𝑎𝑎∙൫𝜎𝜎𝐶𝐶

2+𝑏𝑏∙൫𝜎𝜎𝐶𝐶

(3) 
where the parameters a, b and c depends on the composite and correspond to the coefficients of a second order 
polynomial fitting for the relation ln ΛC vs 𝜎𝜎𝐶𝐶
′ (See Table 1).

In the CNB model, the Neumeister curve can be posed in terms of the number of breaks per unit length or break 
density, Λ, as follows (Vanegas-Jaramillo et al. 2018):

Consequently, the ultimate tensile strength of a GFRP or CFRP composite can be obtained by computing first the 
overall fragmentation limit stress, 𝜎𝜎𝑐𝑐
′, and, then, the critical number of breaks per unit length, ΛC. The first parameter 
takes into account the level of stress that entails to the fragmentation of all fibers, and it is equivalent to: 
𝜎𝜎𝐶𝐶
′ =
𝜎𝜎𝐶𝐶
𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓

where 𝜎𝜎𝐶𝐶 is called the critical stress, which is computed as follows: 
𝜎𝜎𝑐𝑐= 𝜎𝜎0 ቀ

𝛽𝛽+1 
(6) 
and 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓 is the fiber volume content of the composite. In (6), 𝜎𝜎0 is the characteristic stress, 𝐿𝐿𝑜𝑜 is the characteristic length, 
𝜏𝜏 is the fiber-matrix interfacial strength, 𝑑𝑑 is the fiber diameter, and 𝛽𝛽 is the Weibull modulus of the fiber. Once the 
overall fragmentation limit stress, 𝜎𝜎𝐶𝐶
′, has been obtained, it is possible to calculate the critical number of breaks, ΛC, by 
using (3). Then, the value of ΛC is substituted into (4) to compute the ultimate tensile strength of the composite, which 
can be represented as 𝜎𝜎𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶. One of the goals of the present work is to determine which of the microscopic parameters 
intervening in the Neumeister model is able to ‘contract’ the stress-strain curve in such a way that the peak point of this 
curve coincides with the ultimate tensile strength predicted by our CNB model, 𝜎𝜎𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶. 
2.2 Determination of the ultimate strain and tensile strength of the composite. 
The Neumeister model was previously defined in (1). That equation was presented in terms of the damage variable, 
𝑤𝑤, which in turn is defined by (2). By using the Hooke´s law in the fibers, i.e., 𝜎𝜎𝑓𝑓= 𝐸𝐸𝑓𝑓𝜀𝜀, the damage variable can be 
expressed as follows:

where 𝜂𝜂= 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓∙𝐸𝐸𝑓𝑓. The first and second terms in the brackets in (8) can be called the function of intact fibers, 𝐺𝐺(𝜀𝜀), and 
the function of sliding/separation of fibers, 𝐻𝐻(𝜀𝜀), respectively. Thereby, those functions are defined in terms of the 
strain, 𝜀𝜀, as follows:

Taking into account the functions given in (9) and (10), the equation (8) can be represented as: 
𝜎𝜎∞𝑁𝑁𝑒𝑒𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢=  𝜀𝜀∙𝜂𝜂∙ [𝐺𝐺(𝜀𝜀) + 𝐻𝐻(𝜀𝜀)] 
(11) 
In general, the stress-strain response of the composite obeys to several phenomena. For small deformations, the 
material behavior is linear elastic and no cracks are present in the fibers. The linear elastic behavior of the material ceases 
when cracks appear in the fibers. From that point until the peak point of the curve 𝜎𝜎 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣. 𝜀𝜀, several cracks arise in the 
fibers until the maximum saturation of cracks has been achieved. Once the peak of the curve has been reached, the fiber 
fragmentation stops and the fiber sliding and separation become the predominant phenomena, which brings about the 
decrease of the global response of the stress with the strain. The last analysis allows concluding that the Neumeister 
curve only has a global maximum point, which can be obtained by setting the derivative of (11) with respect to 𝜀𝜀 to zero,

The value of the strain 𝜀𝜀 that satisfies (12), can be considered as the ultimate strain of the composites, 𝜀𝜀𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢, 
since the loading support capacity ceases from such point onwards. Consequently, the ultimate tensile strength, 
𝜎𝜎𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢, can be obtained by evaluating (11) in 𝜀𝜀= 𝜀𝜀𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢, leading to:

2.3 Decomposition of the mechanical response of σ vs. ε curve by physical phenomena 
The curve 𝜎𝜎 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 𝜀𝜀 obtained from equation of Neumeister, (1), can be decomposed into several zones that account 
for the phenomena involved in the damage process of the composite as the deformation increases (Figure 2). These 
phenomena are represented in the ‘softening’ terms of the Neumeister equation, which correspond to the two terms in 
brackets in equation (11), namely, the function of intact fibers, 𝐺𝐺(𝜀𝜀), and the function of sliding/separation, 𝐻𝐻(𝜀𝜀). In the 
elastic zone, the Hooke´s law is valid and the function of intact fibers, 𝐺𝐺(𝜀𝜀), is practically one, whereas the 
sliding/separation function, 𝐻𝐻(𝜀𝜀), is almost zero. When 𝐺𝐺(𝜀𝜀) < 0.999 approximately, the fiber fragmentation process 
starts. As long as the length of the fiber fragments is larger than a critical length, lc, the fiber fragmentation is still possible 
and smaller portions are continuously generated; however, when this length is lower than lc, the crack saturation occurs 
and, almost immediately, the sliding/separation function, 𝐺𝐺(𝜀𝜀), becomes significant, which means that fibers are not 
able to break anymore in smaller portions, leading to the sliding and separation of the fibers. 
The Neumeister curve 𝜎𝜎 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 𝜀𝜀 of a typical CFRP composite, whose properties are shown in Table 2, is represented in 
Figure 2. In that curve, three zones can be clearly identified: zone of intact fibers (green zone), zone of fragmentation 
(orange zone) and zone of sliding/separation (red zone). The area of each zone represents the internal strain energy per 
unit volume, in such a way that in that case, of the total energy, 13% corresponds to the intact-fiber phenomenon, 36% 
to fragmentation and 51% to sliding/separation. If the curve is only analyzed until the peak point, 26% of the strain energy 
up to the failure corresponds to the intact-fibers phenomenon and the remaining 74% corresponds to fragmentation.

2.4 Fiber-matrix interfacial strength, 𝝉𝝉: Measurement uncertainty and influence on the σ vs ε curve 
As mentioned before, models based on GLS approach overestimate the value of the ultimate tensile strength, 
𝜎𝜎𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢, in the composites. According to (Swolfs et al. 2015), this is probably caused because GLS neglects the stress 
concentrations when fiber breakage occurs and supposes that when a crack appears in any fiber, the load in the rupture

plane is uniformly transferred to the remaining intact fibers (Curtin 1991a). The global property that accounts for the 
load carrying from the matrix to the intact fibers, when a fiber rupture occurs, is the fiber-matrix interfacial strength, 𝜏𝜏. 
There exist mainly three kinds of mechanical tests to determine that property: micro-bond test, pull-out test and tensile 
dog-bone test (Gaur and Miller 1989)(Zhandarov and Mäder 2014) (Feih et al. 2004), with obtained values of τ that can 
be significantly different each other for the same fiber-matrix interface. In the first type of tests, one drop of the matrix 
is fully held by the filament (Figure 3a), whereas in the second one, the drop is lying on a substrate (Figure 3b). Once the 
solidification of the matrix takes place, fiber is extracted and the force is measured, obtaining a Force vs. Displacement 
plot, as shown in Figure 4 for a typical pull-out test. Due to the small sample dimensions involved in the first two types 
of tests (micro-bond and pull-out), error sources are difficult to control and the repeatability and reproducibility of the 
experiments are low.

Figure 4: Typical Force vs. Displacement plot of a pull-out test (Zhandarov and Mäder 2014). 
On the other hand, in the tensile dog-bone test, a sample consisting on a single fiber embedded in a matrix is 
subjected to axial load and several fragments of fibers are formed as the deformation increases (Figure 5). In this test, 
the interfacial strength is estimated using the following equation: 
𝜏𝜏=
𝜎𝜎𝑓𝑓 𝑑𝑑
 4∙𝑙𝑙𝑐𝑐  
(16) 
Where 𝜎𝜎𝑓𝑓 is the tensile strength of the fiber, d is the fiber diameter and 𝑙𝑙𝑐𝑐 is the critical length. To understand the concept 
of critical length, 𝑙𝑙𝑐𝑐, let us considered a single-fiber sample that is subjected to axial load.  According to Oshawa et al. 
(Ohsawa et al. 1978), the tensile stress that is transferred to a fiber fragment by the matrix at a distance x  from one edge 
of that fragment is given by: 
𝜎𝜎𝑥𝑥=
4 𝜏𝜏
𝑑𝑑𝑥𝑥

of fiber breaks and the correction of the fiber-matrix interfacial strength

Latin American Journal of Solids and Structures, 2019, 16(7), e217 
9/27 
When the maximum stress reaches the tensile strength of the fiber, i.e., 𝜎𝜎𝑥𝑥= 𝜎𝜎𝑓𝑓, the corresponding distance in equation 
(17) is called 𝑥𝑥0, in such a way that (Feih et al. 2004): 
𝜎𝜎𝑓𝑓=
4 𝜏𝜏
𝑑𝑑𝑥𝑥0  
(18) 
If the length of one fiber fragment is larger than 2𝑥𝑥0, the rupture is still possible in that fragment, in such a way that 
when the length of all fragments is lower than 2𝑥𝑥0, the fiber fragmentation is not possible anymore, the crack saturation 
is achieved and the ultimate tensile strength of the composite is obtained. According to (Feih et al. 2004), the average 
length of the fragments is given by: 
𝑙𝑙̅ =
1
2 (𝑥𝑥0 + 2𝑥𝑥0) =
3
2 𝑥𝑥0 
(19) 
The critical length can be considered as 𝑙𝑙𝑐𝑐= 2𝑥𝑥𝑜𝑜, and thereby the equation (19) can be rewritten as follows: 
𝑙𝑙𝑐𝑐 =
4
3 𝑙𝑙̅  
(20) 
Accordingly, in the dog-bone tensile method, the average length of the fragments is measured, the critical length is 
computed using equation (20) and then the fiber-matrix interfacial strength is retrieved from equation (16). This method 
is valid only when the elastic modulus of the matrix is significantly lower than the one of the fiber. As this method implies 
the use of average quantities in one test, measures of statistical dispersion shall be taken into account in the calculations 
(variance, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, etc.). Both the measures of central tendency and dispersion can 
differ considerably from one experiment to another, which means that the repeatability and reproducibility of the dog-
bone tensile method are low as well. Therefore, it can be concluded that the experimental measurement of the fiber-
matrix interfacial strength, τ, can carry out an important uncertainty. This experimental inaccuracy in the determination 
of τ is one of the principal error sources of analytical and numerical models where this property is a fundamental input. 
For instance, Ferreira and Wang proposed a continuous modeling technique to simulate the fiber debonding and pull-
out processes from a cement matrix using different interface mechanical properties. Interface elements with cohesive 
surface tractions were used in the fiber-matrix interface to simulate debonding process, whereas spring elements with a 
variable stiffness related to the shear stress were employed for the pull-out process (Friedrich and Wang 2016). According 
to the numerical results, a change from τ=1.5 MPa to τ=2.5 MPa, which is a possible deviation between experimental 
tests, considerably influences the behavior of the pull-out force with the slip displacement, leading, for example, to an 
increase of the maximum pull out force from 9.5 N to 15 N, approximately. Thereby, considering the uncertainty in the 
measurement of τ and its strong influence in the stress-strain behavior of the composite, this property can be taken as 
the adjustable micromechanical parameter in the present work. 
The modification of the fiber-matrix interfacial strength could change the behavior of the GLS-based models. To 
show this, the effect of 𝜏𝜏 on the curve 𝜎𝜎 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 𝜀𝜀 of a CFRP material whose properties are listed in Table 3, is depicted in 
Figure 6. As can be observed, the decrease of 𝜏𝜏 allows ‘contracting’ the curve and ‘relocating’ the ultimate tensile 
strength, keeping constant the Young modulus of the material, namely, not altering the behavior of the material in the 
linear elastic zone, where the original models have demonstrated to be accurate enough.

In this point, it is important to highlight again that the CNB model is accurate enough to predict the tensile strength. 
Therefore, the fiber-matrix interfacial strength, 𝜏𝜏, can be fitted in such a way that the ultimate tensile strength, 𝜎𝜎𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑒𝑒, 
is equal to the tensile strength calculated by the CNB model, 𝜎𝜎𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶. Consequently, an objective function can be defined 
as:

Figure 6: Influence of the fiber-matrix interfacial strength, τ, in the σ vs ε curve of a typical CFRP using the Neumeister model. 
In this case, the goal is to find the value of 𝜏𝜏 for which 𝐹𝐹≈0. This value is called here the corrected fiber-matrix 
interfacial strength, 𝜏𝜏∗, and it is estimated numerically using the Least Squares Method for non-linear equations in 
bounded domains. This method can be applied to solve the equation defined by 𝐹𝐹= 0 using the function lsqnonlin of 
MATLAB™. This function minimizes the sum of squares of the residuals, 𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖, which in turn is given by 𝑆𝑆= ∑(𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖)2
𝑖𝑖
, in a 
determined interval defined by 𝜏𝜏𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚  and 𝜏𝜏𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 , with a guess given by 𝜏𝜏𝑜𝑜 . Considering that local minimums can be found 
under the stopping condition of lsqnonlin, which is the change of 𝑆𝑆 relative to its initial value, and there is not any well-
defined criterion here to establish a tolerance for such condition, it is necessary to define subintervals and minimize the 
sum of squares of the residuals, 𝑆𝑆, in each subinterval, modifying, recursively, the values of  𝜏𝜏𝑜𝑜 , 𝜏𝜏𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚  and 𝜏𝜏𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 . The 
corrected fiber-matrix interfacial strength, 𝜏𝜏∗, numerically computed, should fulfill the equation |𝐹𝐹| ≤𝜖𝜖, with 𝜖𝜖 as the 
prescribed error. The numerical code developed here to calculate an approximate value for  𝜏𝜏∗ is shown in Figure 7. As 
can be observed, the guess (𝜏𝜏𝑜𝑜), minimum value (𝜏𝜏𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚) y maximum value (𝜏𝜏𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚) of each cycle 𝑗𝑗 are defined by: 
𝜏𝜏𝑜𝑜(𝑗𝑗) = 𝜏𝜏(𝑗𝑗−1) + ∆𝜏𝜏   
(22) 
𝜏𝜏𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 (𝑗𝑗) = 𝜏𝜏𝑜𝑜(𝑗𝑗)  
(23) 
𝜏𝜏𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 = 60 × 106 Pa  
(24) 
where 𝜏𝜏(0) = 1 × 105 Pa,   ∆𝜏𝜏= 1 × 10−6 and the error is considered as 𝜖𝜖= 1 × 10−3. The limits for the fiber-matrix 
interfacial strength, 𝜏𝜏, used in the numerical code were established on the basis of the volumetric fiber content, 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓, of 
the composite. Thus, four typical CFRP and GFRP composites were considered (See Table 4), with 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓 ranging between 
0.15 and 0.40.  For 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓= 0.40, the maximum value of the corrected fiber-matrix interfacial strength,  𝜏𝜏∗, does not exceed 
𝜏𝜏∗= 60 × 106𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃, whereas for 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓= 0.15, the minimum value is above 𝜏𝜏∗= 1 × 105𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃.

In order to calculate the ultimate tensile strength for a determined value of 𝜏𝜏, 𝜎𝜎𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢(𝜏𝜏), it is neccesary first to 
compute the ultimate strain of the composite, 𝜀𝜀𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢, by solving the non-linear equation (12) using the Least Square 
Method too. However, in that case, it is not necessary to divide the principal interval into smaller subintervals since local 
minimums are not expected for the sum of squares of the residual, S, considering that in the curve 𝜎𝜎 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 𝜀𝜀 only a well-
defined maximum point is present, which corresponds to the ultimate tensile strength of the composite (See Figure 6). 
Consequently, the solution of the non-linear equation (12) can be carried out in the interval for the strain defined by 
𝜀𝜀𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚= 0.005 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚/𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 and 𝜀𝜀𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚= 0.03 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚/𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚, with a guess given by 𝜀𝜀𝑜𝑜= 0.005 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚/𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚. The inferior limit for the 
strain is taken as 𝜀𝜀𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚= 0.005 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚/𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 because for lower values of 𝜀𝜀, the CFRP and GFRP unidirectional composite 
materials of Table 4, when loaded along the fibers direction, are still in the elastic zone, as along as 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓 ranges between 
0.15 and 0.40. On the other hand, the superior limit for the strain is taken as 𝜀𝜀𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚= 0.03 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚/𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 because for all 
composites considered here, the firsts two abovementioned phenomena (intact fibers in the elastic zone and 
fragmentation) have been fully developed for that level of strain.  The schematic process to compute numerically the 
corrected fiber-matrix interfacial strength, τ∗, is depicted in Figure 7. 
From now on, this new numerical model, which combines the capacity of a fitting model to predict the ultimate 
tensile strength of unidirectional composites (CNB model) (Vanegas-Jaramillo et al. 2018) with the recursive correction 
of a micromechanical parameter, 𝜏𝜏, to change the behavior of the σ vs. ε curve without altering the stiffness of the 
material, will be referred as the 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶+ 𝜏𝜏∗ model.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS. 
3.1 Assessment of the 𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪+ 𝝉𝝉∗ model. 
In Table 4, the constituent properties, experimental tensile strength and overall fragmentation limit stress of several GFRP 
and CFRP composites are reported. The 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶+ 𝜏𝜏∗ model developed in the present work is used to predict the stress-strain 
behavior of the material 1 shown in that table, which corresponds to carbon fibers T700SC reinforced with an epoxy matrix. 
The corrected fiber-matrix interfacial strength computed by the numerical code of Figure 7 is 𝜏𝜏∗= 1.78 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀, which is much 
lower than the value reported in Table 4, 𝜏𝜏= 23 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀. This happens because the CNB+τ* is essentially a fitting model that 
‘contracts’ the original σ vs. ε curve predicted by the Neumeister equation, taking into account the ultimate tensile strength 
obtained by CNB (which is in turn a model that considers the experimental values of 𝜎𝜎𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢) and modifying, recursively, the 
fiber-matrix interfacial strength, τ*. Accordingly, there are several effects present in a real test that are implicit in the 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶+
𝜏𝜏∗ model, but are not considered in the original Neumeister model, which is purely analytical; for instance, the influence of the 
stress concentration around the broken fibers on the stress distribution and the effect of the fiber packing on the load 
transferring from the matrix to the fibers. In this work, the micromechanical parameter 𝜏𝜏 is fitted to account for these effects 
implicitly and obtain a more realistic stress-strain response of the composite.

Figure 8: Comparison of σ vs. ε curves of the composite CFRP T700SC/EP obtained by original Neumeister and CNB+τ* 
According to the original Neumeister model, equation (1), for a fiber volume content of 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓= 0.38, the ultimate tensile 
strength and ultimate strain of material 1 of Table 4 are 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈,𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁= 1377.40 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 and 𝜀𝜀𝑈𝑈,𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁= 1.75 × 10−2, respectively 
(See blue square marker in Figure 8). The ultimate tensile strength predicted by the Neumeister model, 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈,𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁, considerably 
exceeds the experimental one reported in Table 4, 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈,𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒= 1055 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀, obtaining a relative difference of d=30.55%, where 
𝑑𝑑= ห𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈,𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒−𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈,𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡ห𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈,𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒
ൗ
 and the theoretical strength in this case is 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈,𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡= 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈,𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁.  On the other hand, if the 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶+
𝜏𝜏∗ model described in Section 2 is used to correct the σ vs. ε curve of the composite, the dashed green line of Figure 8 is 
obtained. Let us remember that the 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶+ 𝜏𝜏∗ model comprises two principal steps: 1) the calculation of the ultimate tensile 
strength by the CNB model (Vanegas-Jaramillo et al. 2018), 𝜎𝜎𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐵𝐵, which is represented in the original Neumeister curve of 
Figure 8 by a red dotted marker, 2) the ‘contraction’ of the Neumeister curve by means of the corrected fiber-matrix interfacial 
strength, 𝜏𝜏∗, to obtain a peak point corresponding to  𝜎𝜎𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶  (see black, star-type marker). In this case, the ultimate tensile 
strength and strain predicted by 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶+ 𝜏𝜏∗ are 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈,𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡= 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈,𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶+𝜏𝜏∗= 1067.3 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 and  𝜀𝜀𝑈𝑈,𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶+𝜏𝜏∗= 1.36 × 10−2, 
respectively. The relative difference with the experimental result of Table 4 is d=1.16%, which is significantly lower than the 
one obtained with the original Neumeister model. This satisfactory result is obtained because CNB is a reliable fitting model to 
estimate the ultimate tensile strength of GFRP and CFRP composites, as it was demonstrated in (Vanegas-Jaramillo et al. 2018), 
and additionally, the correction of the fiber-matrix interfacial strength using the numerical code shown in Figure 7, allows 
relocating the maximum point of the σ vs. ε curve, without altering the Young modulus of the material.  
In this point, it is important to remember an important premise of the fiber fragmentation models: the ultimate tensile 
strength should correspond to the critical density of fiber breaks, ΛC, where the crack saturation is reached. In Figure 9, 
the σ vs. Λ curves predicted by Neumeister and CNB+τ* models are compared. These curves can be obtained considering 
that the density of fiber breaks, Λ, is related to the fiber stress, 𝜎𝜎𝑓𝑓, and damage variable, 𝑤𝑤, by the following equations 
(Vanegas-Jaramillo et al. 2018): 
𝜎𝜎𝑓𝑓= (Λ 𝐿𝐿0)
1
𝛽𝛽∙𝜎𝜎0 
(25) 
𝑤𝑤= 2𝐿𝐿𝑐𝑐∙Λ 
(26) 
As can be observed in Figure 9, the critical density of fiber breaks, ΛC, predicted by the Neumeister model is Λ𝑐𝑐,𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁=
3.35 × 10−2 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚−1 (blue square marker), whereas the one predicted by the 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶+ 𝜏𝜏∗ model is Λ𝑐𝑐,𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶+𝜏𝜏∗=
3.47 × 10−1 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚−1 (black, start-type marker). In general, the values of ΛC predicted by our 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶+ 𝜏𝜏∗ model for all materials 
reported in Table 4 are larger than the values predicted by the Neumeister model. This happens because, as mentioned before, 
the corrected interfacial strength, 𝜏𝜏∗, computed here is lower than the interfacial strength obtained experimentally, 𝜏𝜏, and 
according to previous results (Vanegas-Jaramillo et al. 2018), the reduction of the fiber-matrix interfacial strength, 𝜏𝜏, leads to 
the decrease of the average length of the fiber fragments (which is equivalent to the increase of Λ).

Some energetic contributions in the stress-strain curve of the material CFRP T700SC/EP until the failure are 
represented in Figure 10. Two zones can be clearly differentiated: zone of intact fibers (green zone) and zone of 
fragmentation (orange zone). The zone of separation/sliding is not considered since it is not relevant for this particular 
analysis. According to experimental works in unidirectional carbon/epoxy composites (Rochardjo et al. 1997), for the 
levels of fiber volume content considered here, the composite fracture is dominated by the phenomena arising in the 
intact fibers and fragmentation zones, whereas for high fiber volume fractions, fiber pull out needs to be considered. In 
the first zone (green), cracks are not present and the mechanical response of the material is linear elastic (Hooke’s law). 
In the second zone (orange), the fiber fragmentation occurs until the crack saturation is reached and the composites 
fails. The internal strain energy per unit volume released during the damage process is 𝑈𝑈𝑇𝑇= 7.91 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑚𝑚3
⁄
, from which 
21.3% corresponds to the zone of intact fibers and the remaining 78.7%, to the zone of fragmentation.

It is important to remember that CNB+τ* is a semi-empirical model that makes use of several experimental data to 
predict the tensile response of unidirectional CFRP and GFRP composites. These data were previously presented in 
(Vanegas-Jaramillo et al. 2018) and are summarized in Table 5 in the present work. In that table additional 
experiments are considered to validate the present model. In total, 25 experiments were searched in the scientific 
literature, obtaining a maximum and average relative difference of dmax=15.67% and dave=5.01%, respectively, which 
allows concluding that the present model predicts acceptable results when compared to experiments. As 
reasonable, the relative differences are smaller for the experiments that were directly considered in the deduction 
of the present model, however, for the additional experiments that were examined in the present work, not directly 
deemed in the model deduction, acceptable differences were obtained. For instance, let us consider the results of 
a recent benchmarking of strength models for unidirectional composites under longitudinal tension (Bunsell et al. 
2018), whose experimental parameters are reported in row 22 of the Table 5. In that work, four different model 
approaches were evaluated: hierarchical scaling law, direct numerical simulation with linear-elastic matrix, direct 
numerical simulations with elastic-perfectly-plastic matrix and multiscale FE2 model. The relative difference 
between the present CNB+τ* model and the experiment of that benchmarking exercise is 11.05%. For the four 
models assessed in the benchmarking (Bunsell et al. 2018), this difference is approximately: 2.16% for hierarchical 
scaling law, 82.41% for direct numerical simulation with linear elastic matrix, 59.61% for direct numerical 
simulations with elastic-perfectly-plastic matrix and 18.59% for multiscale FE2 model. Thereby, the present model 
predicts more accurate results than the last three mentioned models. The graphical comparison among all models 
and experimental results is shown in Figure 11.

Fragmentation model for the tensile response of unidirectional composites based on the critical number

Figure 11: Stress vs. strain curves obtained by several models and comparison with experimental results. This figure was redrawn 
from (Bunsell et al. 2018) 
3.2 Influence of the fiber volume content on the mechanical response predicted by 𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪+ 𝝉𝝉∗ model. 
In Figure 12, it is shown the influence of the fiber volume content, 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓, on the mechanical response of the T700SC/EP 
composite analyzed in  Section 3.1. In that figure, two phenomena arising during the damage process of the composite 
are identified as IF (Intact fibers) and FM (Fragmentation).  As expected, 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶+ 𝜏𝜏∗ model predicts that the higher the 
fiber volume content, 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓, the larger the ultimate tensile strength, 𝜎𝜎𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢, and the Young modulus of the composite, E.  
However, 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶+ 𝜏𝜏∗ model does not predict a monotonic behavior of the ultimate strain, 𝜀𝜀𝑢𝑢, with the fiber volume 
content, 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓, and this can be explained considering two effects: 1) the reduction of the strain with 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓 in the elastic zone 
for a given stress, and 2) the influence of 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓 on the development of the fiber fragmentation phenomenon. In the first 
case, for a given stress lying in the elastic zone of all materials, the higher 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓, the lower the corresponding strain, which 
is reasonable considering the increase of the Young modulus, E, with 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓.

On the other hand, in the second case, the effect of 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓 on the fiber fragmentation zone, which is delimited between 
the dotted and the star-type markers in each σ vs. ε curve of Figure 12, is not monotonous. For instance, if the σ vs. ε 
curves for 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓= 0.38  (green curve) and 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓= 0.28  (red curve) are compared each other, it can be noticed that the 
reduction of the fiber content,  𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓, brings about an important increase of the strain corresponding  to the start of 
fragmentation (dotted markers) and, additionally, to the broadening of the fragmentation zone, which in turns leads to 
the increase of the ultimate strain, from 𝜀𝜀𝑢𝑢= 1.36 × 10−2 for 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓= 0.38 to 𝜀𝜀𝑢𝑢= 1.64 × 10−2 for 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓= 0.28. However, 
if the σ vs. ε curves for 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓= 0.28 (red curve) and 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓= 0.18  (blue curve) are compared each other, it can be noticed that 
the both the strain corresponding to the start of fragmentation and the ultimate strain slightly decreases with the 
reduction of the fiber content,  𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓, with 𝜀𝜀𝑢𝑢= 1.62 × 10−2 for 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓= 0.18. A possible explanation for this can be addressed 
considering two phenomena: 1) the stress concentration around fiber breaks and 2) the damage progression in a 
transverse plane. In general, the stress concentration around the fiber breaks is lower as the fibers are farther each other, 
namely, as the fiber volume content,  𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓, is lower, leading to a higher ultimate strain, 𝜀𝜀𝑢𝑢, since the stress distribution is 
more uniform. This phenomenon seems to be predominant from 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓= 0.38 to 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓= 0.28. On the other hand, the damage 
progression in a transverse plane of the composite strongly depends on the fiber volume content, 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓. As the fibers are 
farther each other, namely, as 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓 is lower, the probability to obtain a determined number of fiber breaks in a transverse 
plane increases, which means an increase of the damage probability of the composite before reaching a determined 
deformation. This phenomenon seems to be predominant from 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓= 0.28 to 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓= 0.18. The increase of the 
fragmentation strain with the fiber volume content was reported in the experimental work of (Mazen, Metwalli, and El-
Mahallawy 2007), where the influence of four different fiber volume fractions (9.2%, 18.4%, 27.6% and 36.8%) on the 
tensile deformation behavior of epoxy-matrix composites reinforced with glass, carbon and hybrid fibers was studied; in 
those particular experimental tests, the second abovementioned phenomenon seems to be predominant. 
Now, let us consider the influence of the fiber volume content, 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓, on the energetic contributions of the two 
phenomena analyzed here (IF and FM) for the curves represented in Figure 12. In Table 6, the internal strain energy per 
unit volume for the IF and FM zones of each curve are reported. Several aspects are worth-mentioning according to the 
results obtained. Firstly, according to our model, the total strain energy does not increase monotonically with 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓, since 
the biggest energy released until the failure point was obtained for the intermediate fiber volume content, 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓= 0.28, 
where 𝑈𝑈𝑇𝑇= 8.48 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑚𝑚3
⁄
. This happens because the increase of 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓 has a two opposite effects on the fracture toughness 
of the composite material: the higher 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓, the larger the Young modulus and the ultimate tensile strength, which 
contributes to the fracture toughness; however, the higher  𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓,  the larger the number of filaments per unit volume, and 
consequently, the stress concentration around the fiber breaks, which has an adverse effect on the fracture toughness.  
Another aspect that can be noticed is that the percent energetic contribution of the IF and FM zones to the total 
strain energy is very similar for all fiber volume contents considered here, with an average of 21.49% for the IF zone and 
78.51% for the FM zone. This means that the relationship between the strain energy released due to the composite 
elongation in the linear elastic zone (IF) and the strain energy released due to the fiber fragmentation process (FM) does 
not change considerably with 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓 for this particular case. Considering a parameter defined by 𝑟𝑟𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼

⁄
= 3.66 in this case. This means that the strain energy released in the FM zone is 
approximately 3.66 times larger than the strain energy released in the IF zone.

3.3 Stress-strain response of several composite systems using the 𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪+ 𝝉𝝉∗ model 
The  𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶+ 𝜏𝜏∗ model offer the ability to obtain the ultimate strength, ultimate strain and total strain energy in 
terms of the constituent properties and the fiber volume content. So, using this model for each composite in a range of 
𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓, it is possible to predict the mechanical response in several scenarios of design. Accordingly, using 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶+ 𝜏𝜏∗ model, 
Fragmentation model for the tensile response of unidirectional composites based on the critical number 
of fiber breaks and the correction of the fiber-matrix interfacial strength 
Juan David Vanegas-Jaramillo et al.

20/27 
it is possible to develop novel mechanical-performance maps that allow finding the desirable mechanical performance 
of a composite or comparing quickly some composites to fulfill a particular requirement, i.e, a maximum tensile stress, 
an allowable deformation or a target toughness.  The maps for the materials listed in Table 4 are shown in Figure 13 and 
Figure 14. 
In this section, the 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶+ 𝜏𝜏∗ model is used to study the tensile mechanical behaviour of the four composite systems 
reported in Table 4 using the mechanical-performance maps. For each material, a two y-axes plot showing the influence 
of the fiber volume content, 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓, on the total energy of the damage process, 𝑈𝑈𝑇𝑇 (left y-axis) and on the corrected fiber-
matrix interfacial strength, 𝜏𝜏∗ (right y-axis), is reported in Figure 13. In that figure, the total energy is disaggregated into 
the linear elastic energy (IF contribution, purple zone) and fragmentation energy (FM contribution, cyan zone). According 
to the plots, the behavior of 𝑈𝑈𝑇𝑇 and 𝜏𝜏∗ with 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓 is very different for GFRP and CFRP composites. For the CFRP composites, 
a non-linear behavior of 𝑈𝑈𝑇𝑇 can be appreciated (Figures 13 a,b,c), whereas for the GFRP, a linear behavior is observed 
instead (Figure 13d). Additionally, for the CFRP composites, the maximum value of 𝑈𝑈𝑇𝑇 is not reached in the maximum 
value of the fiber volume content considered here, 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓= 0.4, conversely to the case of the GFRP composites where 𝑈𝑈𝑇𝑇 
increases monotonically linear with 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓. Let us remember that the change of 𝑈𝑈𝑇𝑇 with 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓 was attributed to two opposite 
effects: the increase of the Young modulus and ultimate tensile strength with 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓, which increases the fracture toughness, 
and the increase of the stress concentration factor around the fiber breaks with 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓, which has an adverse effect on the 
fracture toughness.  Therefore, according to the results, the first effect is predominant for the GFRP composite in this 
case.  The material with the largest fracture toughness is AS-4/Epoxi composite with 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓= 0.37, where  𝑈𝑈𝑇𝑇=
16.19 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀/𝑚𝑚3.   
As presented in Section 3.2,  the 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶+ 𝜏𝜏∗ model predicts that for the composite T700SC, the ratio of the energy 
released in the fragmentation zone to the energy released in the elastic zone is practically independent on the fiber 
volume content, 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓. If the previously defined parameter 𝑟𝑟𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼
⁄  is computed again for this material and the remaining 
materials of Table 4, considering the range for 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓 presented in Figure 13 (from 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓= 0.15 to 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓= 0.4), with 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓 increasing 
by 0.1, results shown in Table 7 are obtained. Let us remember that 𝑟𝑟𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼
⁄   is the average of the ratio between the 
fragmentation and elastic energies. In Table 7, the averages of the total, elastic and fragmentation strain energies    
(𝑈𝑈𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇
തതതതതതതതത,  𝑈𝑈𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼
തതതത and  𝑈𝑈𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹
തതതതത), as well as the standard deviation of the ratio 𝑟𝑟𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼
⁄ , represented by 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼
⁄ , are reported for 
each composite. According to the relatively small values of 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼
⁄ , the previous result is confirmed: the ratio  𝑟𝑟𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼
⁄  
is almost independent on the fiber volume content, 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓. The largest value of 𝑟𝑟𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼
⁄  is obtained for the GFRP composite, 
where the strain energy released in the FM zone is approximately 7.87 times larger than the strain energy released in 
the IF zone.

Fragmentation model for the tensile response of unidirectional composites based on the critical number

Figure 13: Mechanical-performance-maps with the influence of the fiber volume content, 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓, on both the released energy, 
𝑈𝑈(Total,   IF & FM), and the corrected fiber-matrix interfacial strength, 𝜏𝜏∗, predicted by CNB+τ*. 
Regarding the corrected fiber-matrix interfacial strength, 𝜏𝜏∗, a similar conclusion can be addressed: it changes 
monotonically with 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓 for the GFRP composite, whereas for the CFRP composites, a maximum point is obtained in 
between the minimum and maximum fiber content.  
The mechanical-performance maps on Figure 14 are two y-axes plots where the change of the ultimate tensile strength, 
𝜎𝜎𝑢𝑢 (left y-axis) and of the ultimate strain, 𝜀𝜀𝑢𝑢 (right y-axis) with 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓, for each one of the materials listed in Table 4, is shown. The 
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶+ 𝜏𝜏∗ model predicts a non-linear increase of the ultimate tensile strength, 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈, with the fiber content, 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓, for the CFRP 
composites, whereas for the GFRP composite, this increase is linear. Theoretically, the ultimate tensile strength, 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈, should 
increase with the fiber content, 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓, however, in some experimental works, the reduction of 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 with 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓 has been reported from 
a determined value of fiber content, and this can be attributed mainly to the manufacturing process. For instance, the decrease 
of 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 with 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓 for glass fiber/polypropylene composites, from 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓= 20% onwards, was reported in (Lee and Jang 1999), and 
such reduction was attributed to the void content of the composite, which was manufactured by a vacuum-assisted process. 
For carbon reinforced PTFE composites, a non-linear increase of 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 with 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓 until 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓= 30% was obtained in the experimental 
work of (Li 2010), in agreeing with the results obtained here for CFRP composites; however, from 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓= 30% onwards, the 
reduction of 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 with 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓 was reported; injection molding process was used in that work to manufacture the samples for the 
mechanical tests. A non-monotonic behavior of 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 with 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓 has been obtained as well for carbon-fabric/polycarbonate 
laminates prepared by a two-Step hot-press technique (Liu et al. 2018),  unidirectional carbon/epoxy composite used in the 
design of an automobile suspension system (Ali and Anjaneyulu 2018), carbon fabric reinforced polyetherimide composites 
fabricated by impregnation techniques (Bijwe and Rattan 2007), among others; in all cases, in the zone where 𝜎𝜎𝑢𝑢 and 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓 are 
directly proportional, the increase of 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 with 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓 is non-linear, coinciding with the present results of CFRP composites; 
additionally, the inflection point where the behavior of 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 with 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓 is modified mainly depends on the processing conditions of 
the composite. This processing conditions can entail many defects that affect the mechanical performance of the composite 
(Vanegas-jaramillo, Patiño-Arcila, and Vargas-Isaza 2013) and are not directly considered in many theoretical models. 
For the ultimate strain, 𝜀𝜀𝑢𝑢, a different behavior between the GFRP and CFRP composites is predicted as well: a non-
monotonous variation of 𝜀𝜀𝑢𝑢 with 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓  is obtained for CFRP, while for GFRP, an increasing change can be appreciated. On 
the basis of these results, another important difference between the GFRP and CFRP composites can be identified: in the 
first ones, the increase of 𝜎𝜎𝑢𝑢 entails an increase of 𝜀𝜀𝑢𝑢, which does not happen for the second ones.  The more resistant

material is AS-4 with 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓= 0.4, where  𝜎𝜎𝑢𝑢= 1601.5𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀. On the other hand, the more ductile material is the glass 
composite with 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓= 0.4, where 𝜀𝜀𝑢𝑢= 0.0251𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚/𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚.  The behavior of 𝜀𝜀𝑢𝑢 with 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓 in GFRP and CFRP composites has 
been experimentally studied too. In agreement with the present results, the tensile curves reported in (Yu et al. 2019) 
for additively manufactured continuous carbon fiber-reinforced polymer composites clearly shows that the ultimate 
tensile strain, 𝜀𝜀𝑢𝑢, does not have a uniform behavior with the fiber content, whereas 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 has an incremental behavior with 
𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓 that is consistent with the results obtained here. Similar tendencies were obtained by (Naranjo-Lozada et al. 2019) for 
continuous fiber composites in a nylon matrix produced by additive manufacturing.  On the other hand, another 
experimental works have obtained a different behavior of 𝜀𝜀𝑢𝑢 with 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓. For instance, the continuous decrease of 𝜀𝜀𝑢𝑢 with 
𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓 was reported by (Yang et al. 2017) for carbon-fabric/polycarbonate composites, with 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓 ranging between 18.6% and 
35.2%, whereas an opposite behavior was reported for glass-fiber/epoxy composites with 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓 ranging between 9.2% and 
36.8%, namely, 𝜀𝜀𝑢𝑢 continuously increases with 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓 (Mazen et al. 2007). In general, the former tendency, i.e, the reduction 
of 𝜀𝜀𝑢𝑢 with 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓, is observed in the CFRP composites using the present model in ranges that are relatively close to the one 
considered by (Yang et al. 2017); moreover, the second tendency, i.e.,  the increase of 𝜀𝜀𝑢𝑢 with 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓, also coincides with the 
one obtained here for GFRP composites; however, it is important to mention that the fiber configurations of these two 
experimental works is different to the unidirectional configuration considered here, and further experiments are needed 
to confirm the present numerical results.   
In Table 8, the ultimate tensile strengths computed by the 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶+ 𝜏𝜏∗ model and two additional analytical models, 
namely, Neumeister (Neumeister 1993a)  and SFF (Koyanagi et al. 2009), for the composite systems reported in Table 4, 
are compared with experimental values. The ultimate tensile strengths computed by the 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶+ 𝜏𝜏∗ model fit better to 
the experimental values than the ones computed by the other analytical models. For instance, considering the four 
composite systems listed in Table 8, the L2 relative error norm of the 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶+ 𝜏𝜏∗ model is 2.45%, whereas this value is 
34.06% for Neumeister and 27.52% for SFF.

4 CONCLUSIONS 
A fragmentation model for the tensile response of unidirectional composites was developed in the present work. 
The model is the combination of two developments: 1) the previously published CNB model, which is based on the 
Neumeister model and allows obtaining an accurate ultimate tensile strength for CFRP and GFRP composites in terms of 
the number of fiber breaks per unit length, Λ, 2) A numerical procedure developed here to estimate the corrected fiber-
matrix interfacial strength, 𝜏𝜏∗, that ‘contracts’ the σ vs ε curve, in order to achieve a good agreement between the peak 
point of that curve and the strength predicted by CNB. This does not affect the stiffness of the material in the linear 
elastic zone, keeping constant the Young modulus. The present model is named 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶+ 𝜏𝜏∗ model. 
The accuracy of the 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶+ 𝜏𝜏∗ model was evaluated by comparing the ultimate tensile strengths obtained by the 
model with the experimental ones reported in literature for four composite systems. According to the results, this initial 
assessment shows that 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶+ 𝜏𝜏∗ model is more accurate than other GLS-based analytical models (Neumeister and SFF). 
Results show that the strength obtained by 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶+ 𝜏𝜏∗ is lower than the one found by Neumeister for all composites 
systems considered here, with more important differences for the carbon-reinforced composites than for the glass-
reinforced one. On the other hand, the tensile strength predicted by SFF can be lower or higher than the one obtained 
by 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶+ 𝜏𝜏∗. It is important to highlight that the critical density of fibers breaks, ΛC, which corresponds to the ultimate 
tensile strength of the composite, is larger in the 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶+ 𝜏𝜏∗ than in the original Neumeister model, and this is attributable 
to the decrease of the average length of the fiber fragments with the reduction of the fiber-matrix interfacial strength. 
The 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶+ 𝜏𝜏∗ model was used to study the influence of the fiber content, 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓, on the stress-strain response of four 
composite systems by means of novel mechanical-performance maps. The principal conclusions can be summarized as 
follows: 
• 
As reasonable, the increase of the ultimate tensile strength, 𝜎𝜎𝑢𝑢, with 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓 is predicted by the model, but this increase 
is dissimilar between CFRP  and GFRP composites; in the first case, it is non-linear, in the second one, it can be 
considered linear.  
• 
Generally speaking, the behavior of the ultimate strain, 𝜀𝜀𝑈𝑈, with the fiber content, 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓, is not monotonous for the 
CFRP composites, whereas an increasing non-linear behavior was found for the GFRP one. Two aspects were 
identified to govern this: the reduction of the strain with 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓 in the elastic zone for a given stress, and the influence 
of 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓 on the development of the fiber fragmentation phenomenon. The second aspect is in turn determined by the 
stress concentration around the broken fibers and the damage progression in a transverse plane. According to the 
results, the reduction of the probability to obtain a determined number of fiber breaks in a transverse plane with 
the increase of 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓, which leads to the reduction of the damage probability before reaching a determined 
deformation, is the predominant effect for the  GFRP composite. For the CFRP composites, a predominant effect for 
all fiber contents, 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓, is not identified. 
• 
The change of the total strain energy, 𝑈𝑈𝑇𝑇, with 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓 is non-monotonous and non-linear for the CFRP composites, 
whereas for the GFRP composite, it is linear increasing. According to the results, two opposite effects shall be 
considered to analyze the behavior of the fracture toughness with 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓: the increase of the Young modulus and 
ultimate tensile strength with 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓, and the increase of the stress concentration factor around the fiber breaks with 
𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓. The first effect seems to be predominant for the GFRP composite, while for the CFRP composites, a major effect 
is not manifested for all fiber contents, 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓.  
• 
For a determined composite system, the percent contributions of the linear elastic zone (IF) and fragmentation zone 
(FM) to the total energy released during the damage process are almost invariant with the fiber content, 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓. For the 
Fragmentation model for the tensile response of unidirectional composites based on the critical number 
of fiber breaks and the correction of the fiber-matrix interfacial strength

four composite systems considered here, the energy released in the FM zone is larger than the one released in the 
IF zone, and this difference is bigger for the GFRP composite.
