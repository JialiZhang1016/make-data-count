1 Introduction
Extrusion is a food processing technique with the characteristics 
of high temperature and short time (De Cruz et al., 2015), which 
is one of the most important processing techniques applied 
in the development of food products (Tiwari & Jha, 2017; 
Masatcioglu et al., 2014; Moscicki & van Zuilichem, 2011).
It combines several unit operations including mixing, cooking, 
kneading, shearing, shaping and forming (Stojceska et al., 2009). 
The short residence time should reduce the side reactions, such 
as degradation of bioactive compounds (Hirth et al., 2014). 
Therefore, extrusion cooking is an increasingly technology used 
for producing snack foods and breakfast cereals.
Extruded foods are composed mainly of cereals, starches, 
and/or vegetable proteins. Numerous reports showed that 
starch-based materials are ideal for extrusion processing 
(Moad, 2011; Yu et al., 2012), because the major role of these 
ingredients is to form the structure, texture, mouth feel and 
many other characteristics desired for specific finished products 
(Anton et al., 2009; Li et al., 2014).
Tuna, an important commodity of marine fish, is mainly used 
for canned and frozen products. However, a considerable part of 
tuna such as red meat and tail are not used, but just be a waste of 
environment (Suseno, 2015). It is estimated that ten percent of 
total fish are underutilized because of the undesirable features, 
including small size, dark color, strong flavor, unacceptable textural 
properties, and the presence of toxic substances. Utilization of 
low-value fishes is of great importance in developing countries. 
However, due to the undesirable features mentioned above, the 
underutilized fishes are mainly discarded rather than consumed 
(Tumuluru et al., 2013). Extrusion cooking will improve the 
texture and other physical properties of underutilized fishes 
and make them suitable for human consumption (Singh et al., 
2014). Varieties of products with mince as raw material can be 
made by extrusion (Lakshmi Devi et al., 2013). Several studies 
have reported the successful incorporation of fish flesh or fish 
powder into starch-based materials by extrusion processes 
to produce nutritious extrudates, which could be acceptable 
by consumers (Samuelsen et al., 2014; Samuelsen et al., 2013; 
Shaviklo et al., 2011). However, the data available on tuna meat 
with incorporation of corn starch extrudates is limited.
In the present study, tuna meat mixed with corn starch of 
different contents (20%, 25%, 30%, 35% and 40%, w/w) was 
subjected to extrusion cooking processing. The experimental 
range of corn starch contents was determined by preliminary 
experiments, which showed that the extrudates with corn starch 
contents lower than 20 wt% was too hard to bite, but higher than 
40 wt% would lead to poor formability. The aim of this study 
was to produce the extrudates possessed the better physical and 
chemical properties, with the underutilized tuna fish protein by 
extrusion technology, meanwhile avoiding the waste of resources.

Abstract
Effect of extrusion cooking using different corn starch contents on the physicochemical properties (expansion ratio, bulk density, 
color, hardness, protein in vitro digestibility, crude protein content, thermal properties and microstructure) of tuna meat-based 
extrudates was investigated. The results showed that the increased corn starch content led to darker, greener, yellower and lower 
crude protein content of extrudates, but no significant difference was observed in expansion ratio, bulk density and hardness. 
The lowest protein in vitro digestibility of 82.83±0.39% appeared when the corn starch content was 20 wt%. The results of DSC 
revealed that tuna meat with corn starch content of 30 wt% and 20 wt% had the highest and lowest denaturation temperature 
of 99.4oC and 81.9 oC, respectively. The results of SEM indicated that the extrudate with 30 wt% corn starch content possessed 
the more integrated and distinct muscle fibers. Besides, the acceptability of the extrudate with 30 wt% corn starch content was 
significant better than others (p˂0.05). These results revealed that the tuna meat-based extrudates using 30 wt% of corn starch 
exhibited desirable physicochemical properties.
Keywords: extrusion cooking; tuna; corn starch; physicochemical properties; extrudate.
Practical Application: Tuna meat-based extrudates with 30 wt% corn starch have the best physicochemical properties.

Tuna-based extrudates with corn starch
2 Materials and methods
2.1 Materials
Corn starch was obtained from Hengren Trade & Industry 
Co., Ltd., Shandong, China. Frozen tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) 
meat was stored at -20 oC and supported by Today’s Food Co., 
Ltd, Ningbo, China.
2.2 Experimental design and conditions
The twin-screw extruder (Syslg32-II, Jinan Saibainuo 
Technology Development Co. Ltd, China) was used. All variables 
and parameters were kept constant except corn starch contents 
in this study. The moisture content of raw materials was 30%, 
and the extrusion cooking parameters were as follows: barrel 
temperature 180 oC, screw speed 250 rpm (revolutions per 
minute), and feeder speed 30 rpm.
2.3 Preparation of extrudates
The frozen tuna meat was thawed at room temperature in 
the dark, and spread evenly before dried at 60 oC to control the 
moisture content of 36%. Then it was mixed with corn starch with 
different contents (20%, 25%, 30%, 35% and 40%, w/w). After 
that, the mixtures were adjusted the moisture content to 30% by 
adding water and stored at 4 oC for12 h before extrusion cooking 
processing. The extrudates were cooled to room temperature 
and then tested. The process flow chart of extrudates preparation 
was shown in Figure 1.
2.4 Expansion ratio
Sectional expansion, the ratio of diameter of the extrudates 
and the diameter of die (4 mm), was used to express the expansion 
of extrudate (Ding et al., 2006). The expansion ratio values were 
obtained from 10 samples for each extrudate.
2.5 Bulk density
Bulk density was determined from the volume displacement 
method caused by the extrudates which had been previously 
weighed and then covered with sea sand. The volume of decrease 
was obtained when removing the extrudates. Measurements were 
made on ten randomly chosen pieces of extrudate (2.5 cm long) 
from each run. Bulk density was calculated using the following 
equation:
Bulk density (g/mL) = mass of extrudate (g) / volume of 
decrease (mL).
2.6 Color
The color of the extrudates was assessed using a 
Hunter-Labcolorimeter (Optical Sensor, Hunter Associates 
Laboratory Inc., Reston VA, USA). In the Hunter-Lab colorimeter, 
the color of a sample was denoted by the three dimensions 
(L*, a* and b*). The L* value gave a measure of the lightness of 
the product from 100 for perfect white to zero for black, as the eye 
would evaluate it. The redness/greenness and yellowness/blueness 
were denoted by a* and b* values (Altan et al., 2008), respectively. 
Ten samples were used for each extrudate.

2.7 Hardness
The texture characteristics of the extrudate were measured 
using a Stable Micro System TA-XT Plus texture analyser (UK) 
fitted with cylinder probe. Cross head speed was 1.00 mm/s. 
The samples were punctured by the probe to a distance of 6 mm, 
corresponding to approximately 40-60% of the diameter of the 
extrudates. All sample sizes were 50 mm in length and diameters 
between 10.8-14.4 mm.
2.8 Protein In Vitro Digestibility (PIVD)
The PIVD of the extrudates was determined by the modified 
method (Monsoor & Yusuf, 2002). Extrudate (1.5 g) was 
suspended in 113 mL (0.1 N) HCl solution containing 15 mg 
of pepsin. The suspension was incubated for 3 h at 37 oC and 
then neutralized with 0.2 N NaOH to adjust the pH to 7.5-8.0. 
Phosphate (56 mL, pH 7.4) containing 30 mg of pancreatin, 
7.5 mM CaCl2 and 0.01% NaN3 was added to the suspension. 
The mixture was then further incubated for 24 h at 37oC for 
digestion to occur. Enzyme blanks were prepared under the 
same conditions without extrudate samples. The undigested 
protein was precipitated by adding 30% trichloroacetic acid 
(TCA) solution and separated by ashless filter paper (Whatman 
no. 4). The amount of undigested protein was measured by the 
Kjeldahl method (N×6.25). PIVD was calculated using the 
following equation:
PIVD (%) = [1-Undigested protein/Total protein 
(in 1.5 g extrudate)] ×100%
2.9 Crude protein content
Crude protein content was determined from the crude 
nitrogen content of the sample determined by the Kjedahl 
method (N×6.25).
2.10 Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
The DSC of extrudates was determined by the modified 
method (He et al., 2013). Thermal measurements were carried 
out using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC-1, Mettler 
Toledo, Switzerland). The raw material should be freeze-dried 
before DSC test. Approximately 3 mg protein powders were 
carefully weighed into an aluminium pan and a sealed empty 
aluminium pan was used as the reference. The run was conducted 
in the temperature range 0-100 oC in a nitrogen stream (flow rate 
of 20 mL/min, heating rate 5 oC /min). The peak temperature 
(Tp) and heat flow were determined.
2.11 Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)
The DXS-X2 scanning electron microscope (Nanjing, 
China) was adopted to observe the internal structure and 
particle distribution of extrudates. The test condition was as 
follows: instruct name S-4700, magnification 800, accelerating 
voltage 15000 Volt, emission current 9000 nA, working distance 
15100 µm, micron marker 50000, specimen bias 0, scan speed 
slow 3, calibration scan speed 7, lens mode analysis, color mode 
gray scale, screen mode standard screen, data display combine 1.
2.12 Sensory evaluation
The raw material (tuna meat) and the extrudates with different 
corn starch contents (20%, 25%, 30%, 35% and 40%, w/w) were 
subjected to sensory evaluation, to assess the effect of extrusion 
cooking and corn starch contents on the acceptability of products. 
The acceptability to the aspects of texture, flavor and color were 
all determined.
The sensory panel consisted of 20persons (10 female/10 male; 
aged between 25 and 35 years). The assessors were previously 
trained in odor recognition, sensory evaluation techniques and had 
experience in sensory evaluation of meat products. The method 
of sensory assessment was according to Fang et al. (2017). 
The panelists cleared their nasal passage between samples 
by 1 min resting. The sensory descriptors were evaluated by a 
nine-point scale (1=“dislike extremely”, 9=“like extremely”). 
A score of 5 was considered as a neutral score, and the scores 
larger than 5 were in the “like” range.
2.13 Statistical analysis
Statistical significant differences between values were 
evaluated at P< 0.05 level with a pairwise comparison tests using 
SPSS 21.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics).
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Expansion ratio
Effects of different corn starch contents on expansion ratio 
of the extrudates were shown in Table 1. The expansion ratio 
of the extrudates ranged from 1.17±0.04 to 1.23±0.07, and no 
significantly difference was observed between the extrudates 
(p˃0.05). The expansion conditions (sleeve temperature, screw 
speed and feeder speed) and the properties of tuna meat were 
the same in this study. However, different corn starch contents 
seemed to have no influence on expansion ratio. The degree 
of expansion of the extrudate is related to the size, amount 
and distribution of the air surrounded by the cooked matrix 
(Yanniotis et al., 2007). The expansion ratio was closely related 
to moisture content (Beck et al., 2017; Singh et al., 2014),however 
the moisture content remained the same (30 wt%) for each 
extrudate in the present study.
3.2 Bulk density and hardness
From Table 1, bulk density and hardness of the extrudates 
ranged from 0.84±0.06 g/mL to 1.01±0.13 g/mL and 41910±8988 N 
to 51834±8494 N, respectively.
Statistical analyses showed that the bulk density displayed 
no significant changes among different corn starch contents 
(p˃0.05). It had been reported that the bulk density and porosity 
of extruded products were dependent on feed moisture content, 
residence time and temperature, which were fixed in our paper 
(Gopirajah & Muthukumarappan, 2017; Thymi et al., 2005).
The hardness is the average force required for a probe 
to penetrate the extrudate. The same to expansion ratio, no 
significant difference was observed between the extrudates with 
different corn starch contents (p˃0.05). Previous study reported 
Food Sci. Technol, Campinas, 39(3): 627-634, July-Sept. 2019
630   630/634
Tuna-based extrudates with corn starch
that the hardness of extrudate increased as the feed moisture 
content increased (Shraddha et al., 2017), which was controlled 
to 30 wt% in our study.
From what has been discussed above, it can be founded 
that the different corn starch contents were not the decisive 
factor on bulk density and hardness during extrusion cooking.
3.3 Color and crude protein content
Food color is one of the appearance indexes; which is one 
of the important qualities of external features, besides the crude 
protein content of food is the foundation and essential estimated 
index of nutritional value.
Table 1 reflected that the color (L*, a* and b* value) and crude 
protein content decreased with the increased corn starch contents, 
from 46.99±3.49 to 36.69±3.74 (L*), 8.02±0.75 to 3.52±1.11 (a*), 
23.29±3.26 to 9.78±3.27 (b*) and 76.44±1.44% to 59.84±1.51% 
(crude protein content), respectively. While color (L*, a* and b* value) 
has no significant influence between adjacent corn starch contents 
(p˃0.05), as evidenced by statistical results. It might be due to 
with the increase of corn starch content, the Maillard reaction 
would occur violently in sleeve between monosaccharide from 
polysaccharide decomposition and protein molecules from tuna 
meat. Another reason might be also due to the increased corn 
starch contents, which made the extrudates displayed the color 
closer to corn starch. Therefore, the color was a trend of slight 
decrease. On the other hand, decreased tuna meat content caused 
the drop of exturdates crude protein content because of higher 
protein content in tuna meat than the corn starch.
3.4 PIVD
At present, the research on protein digestibility methods 
mainly includes protein in vivo digestibility and protein in vitro 
digestibility. In general, the former is time consuming and needs 
more costs, while PIVD is relatively simple, fast method, and 
has good repeatability.
Protein denaturation and starch gelatinization are the main 
reactions occurred during extrusion cooking, by the combined 
effect of pressure, temperature and mechanical shear (Surasani, 
2016). However, protein denaturation and starch gelatinization 
will improve the digestibility, resulting to the increase of PIVD. 
According to Boff Zortéa-Guidolin et al. (2017), the degrees of 
denaturation and gelatinization increased on account of suited 
increasing moisture content, feeder rate, screw speed and barrel 
temperature, but exceed high barrel temperature decreased 
protein digestibility contrarily.
In this study, the results showed that there was no significant 
difference of PIVD between different corn starch contents 
except 20 wt%, which with the lowest PIVD of 82.83±0.39%. 
The extrudate with the lowest content of corn starch (20 wt%) 
meant the highest protein content, which would significantly 
reduce the denatured degree of protein due to the content of 
protein was too high under the same operating conditions, 
resulting to the lowest PIVD. However, the denatured degree 
did not reduce when the content of corn starch was larger than 
20 wt%. It was indicated that the denatured degree was similar 
if the content of protein was in a reasonable range.
3.5 Thermal properties
The denaturation temperature is used to describe the thermal 
stability of protein and it is one of the most important factors 
in food processing. Because protein denaturation can cause 
protein senior structure unfold and sequentially various food 
features reduced or lost significantly. Therefore, determination 
of food protein denaturation temperature has important guiding 
significance for protein application. DSC, a heat analysis method 
developed in the 1960s, has become an important tool in detection 
of protein denaturation temperature (He et al., 2013).
In this study, DSC was used to determine the thermal 
denaturation temperature of the extrudates. As presented in 
Figure 2, all the extrudates displayed prominent endothermic 
peaks, and the peak temperature is the denaturation temperature. 
The denaturation temperatures of extrudates with different corn 
starch contents (20%, 25%, 30%, 35% and 40%, w/w) were 81.9 oC, 
94.6 oC, 99.4 oC, 89.6 oC and 84.9 oC, respectively.
As described above, starch gelatinization is one of main 
reactions during extrusion cooking. Starch gelatinization is a 
process of breaking down the hydrogen bonds in the presence 
of water and heat, further lead to the breakdown of starch 
grains and the formation of micellar network (Jafari et al.,

2017; Akande et al., 2017). The overall strength of the micellar 
network could influence the thermal stability of extrudates, 
which was dependent on the operational conditions. However, 
except starch gelatinization, degradation also occurred during 
extrusion cooking, not only the degradation of starch grains 
but also the degradation of gelatinized starch (Liu et al., 2017; 
Mitrus et al., 2017). The degradation of gelatinized starch would 
destroy the micellar network and reduce its strength.
According the results of DSC, the thermal stability of the 
extrudate with 30 wt% of corn starch content was the best, and 
it turned weaker no matter the content of corn starch increased 
or decreased. When the content of corn starch less than 30 wt%, 
the less starch content lead to more degree of degradation, which 
lead to the weaker strength of micellar network. Therefore, the 
thermal stability reduced as the corn starch contents reduced from 
30 wt% to 20 wt%. However, the thermal stability also reduced 
when the content of corn starch more than 30 wt%. The more 
content of corn starch meant the less content of protein, and the 
less content of protein resulted in the weaker thermal stability.
3.6 Microstructure
To explore the internal micro sturcture of the extrudates, 
the samples were subjected to SEM examination. From the 
micrographs, the integrated and distinct muscle fiber could be 
observed from Figure 3c. Besides, the micrograph of 30 wt% 
corn starch content was obviously smoother as compared with 
others, which indicated the corn starch grains were completely 
gelatinized.
As discussed above, the less starch content of corn starch 
lead to more degradation when the content less than 30 wt%. 
The observed particulates in Figure 3(a) and (b) were due to 
the degradation of gelatinized starch, which broke the formed 
micellar network during extrusion. Besides, the fracture of muscle 
fiber was also obvious. However, the observed particulates in 
Figure 3(d) and (e) were due to the un-gelatinized corn starch 
particles adhered to the surface of muscle fiber, which suggested 
the incomplete gelatinization degree. It might be not conducive 
to the taste and acceptability of the extrudates by consumers 
(Omosebi et al., 2018).
In conclusion, the results of micrographs were in agreement 
with the results of DSC. 30 wt% of corn starch content was more 
suitable for the extrusion cooking of tuna meat, because the 
gelatinization degree was optimal under our operating conditions.
3.7 Sensory evaluation
The sensory assessment of the acceptability of each sample 
is shown in Table 2.
As shown in Table 2, the sensory scores of tuna meat 
on texture, flavor and color were 1.36±0.20, 2.03±0.58 and 
3.61±0.91, respectively, and the overall acceptability score 
was 2.34±1.14. As described in introduction, the tuna meat 
with the disadvantages of dark, strong flavor and unacceptable 
textural properties, therefore the tuna meat were unacceptable 
to the sensory panel. Besides, the strong flavor mainly referred 
to fishy odor, this was because the tuna meat was rich in 
unsaturated fatty acids and the unsaturated fatty acids were 
readily oxidized to the volatile compounds with fishy odor 
(Fang et al., 2017). However, the texture, flavor and color 
were all improved after the treatment of extrusion cooking. 
The scores of the extrudates with different corn starch contents 
in all aspects were all larger than 5, which meant that they 
were all acceptable to the sensory panel. The improvement of 
texture, flavor and color were possibly due to the formation 
of micellar network and Maillard reaction during extrusion 
cooking (Cho & Ryu, 2017).

Tuna-based extrudates with corn starch
Besides, no significant difference was observed between the 
extrudates with different corn starch contents in the aspects of 
flavor and color (p˃0.05), which indicated that the corn starch 
contents had no effect on the flavor and color of extrudate. 
However, the texture of the extrudates with different corn starch 
contents differed significantly. The extrudate with 30 wt% corn 
starch content was most satisfied by sensory panel, followed 
by 25 wt%, 35 wt%, 40 wt% and 20 wt%. As discussed in 3.6, 
when the content of corn starch was too little, the degradation 
of gelatinized starch would be more serious, which would break 
the formed micellar network during extrusion. However, when 
the content of corn starch was too much, the un-gelatinized corn 
starch particles would be adhered to the surface of muscle fiber. 
Therefore, the extrudate with 30 wt% corn starch content was 
significant better than others in texture (p˂0.05).
Above all, the overall acceptability of the extrudate with 
30 wt% corn starch content was significant better than others 
(p˂0.05), which also indicated that 30 wt% of corn starch content 
was more suitable for the extrusion cooking of tuna meat.
4 Conclusion
In this paper, the effect of extrusion cooking with different 
corn starch contents on the characteristics of tuna-based 
extrudates was studied. Expansion ratio, bulk density, color, 
hardness, protein in vitro digestibility, crude protein content, 
thermal properties and microstructure of the extrudates were 
measured. Besides, the acceptability of the extrudates was 
assessed by sensory evaluation.
The results showed that the corn starch contents had no effect 
on expansion ratio, bulk density and hardness of the extrudates. 
However, with the increase of corn starch content, the color of 
extrudate turned to darker, greener and yellower, which was 
mainly due to the more intense Maillard reaction and the color of

the corn starch contents larger than 20 wt%, which indicated the

denatured degree was similar if the content of protein was in a 
reasonable range. According to the results of DSC, the thermal 
stability of the extrudate with 30 wt% of corn starch content was 
much better than others, which indicated that the strength of 
formed micellar network was the strongest. Besides, the results 
of micrographs were also in agreement with the results of DSC. 
Above all, the overall acceptability of the extrudate with 30 wt% 
corn starch content was significant better than others (p˂0.05), 
which also indicated that 30 wt% of corn starch content was 
more suitable for the extrusion cooking of tuna meat.
