Abstract: In the past decade, Long-Range Wire-Area Network (LoRaWAN) has emerged as one of
the most widely adopted Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) standards. Signiﬁcant efforts
have been devoted to optimizing the operation of this network. However, research in this domain
heavily relies on simulations and demands high-quality real-world trafﬁc data. To address this
need, we monitored and analyzed LoRaWAN trafﬁc in four European cities, making the obtained
data and post-processing scripts publicly available. For monitoring purposes, we developed an
open-source sniffer capable of capturing all LoRaWAN communication within the EU868 band. Our
analysis discovered signiﬁcant issues in current LoRaWAN deployments, including violations of
fundamental security principles, such as the use of default and exposed encryption keys, potential
breaches of spectrum regulations including duty cycle violations, SyncWord issues, and misaligned
Class-B beacons. This misalignment can render Class-B unusable, as the beacons cannot be validated.
Furthermore, we enhanced Wireshark’s LoRaWAN protocol dissector to accurately decode recorded
trafﬁc. Additionally, we proposed the passive reception of Class-B beacons as an alternative timebase
source for devices operating within LoRaWAN coverage under the assumption that the issue of
misaligned beacons can be addressed or mitigated in the future. The identiﬁed issues and the
published dataset can serve as valuable resources for researchers simulating real-world trafﬁc and for
the LoRaWAN Alliance to enhance the standard to facilitate more reliable Class-B communication.

1. Introduction
The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized the way we interact with our envi-
ronment, enabling a wide range of applications from smart cities to industrial automation.
Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) have emerged as key technology for IoT,
providing a balance between low power consumption and long-range communication.
Long-Range Wire-Area Network (LoRaWAN), a popular LPWAN technology, is based
on the Long-Range (LoRa) physical layer and provides features such as adaptive data rates,
bidirectional communication, and various device classes, making it suitable for different
use cases. Given the limited Radio Frequency (RF) power of 25 mW, LoRaWAN facilitates a
communication distance of up to 5 km in urban areas [1]. These diverse capabilities have
led to widespread adoption across various industries, establishing it as a vital component
in the growing IoT ecosystem [2,3].
The LoRa Physical (PHY) layer employs a unique modulation technique known as
Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS). CSS facilitates long-range communication and robustness
against narrow-band interference by spreading the information signal over a wider band-
width [4]. Above this, the LoRaWAN Medium Access Control (MAC) layer provides a
standardized protocol for IoT devices [5].

LoRaWAN features three distinct device classes—A, B, and C—addressing different
application requirements and power constraints [5]. Class-A devices offer the highest
energy efﬁciency, suitable for applications with infrequent communication needs, with brief
receive windows after each transmission. Class-B devices provide predictable downlink
communication latency by synchronizing with network beacons and enabling scheduled
receive slots, maintaining moderate power consumption. Class-C devices prioritize down-
link latency over power efﬁciency, offering continuous receive windows for near real-time
communication. End devices use a random access transmission method (ALOHA), which
allows them communication without the need for pairing with a speciﬁc gateway.
Given the complexity and diverse operating conditions of LoRaWAN, it is essential
to gain insight into its actual internal functionality in real deployments using tools for
network communication analysis. To address this need, we developed a dedicated hard-
ware sniffer—a specialized device designed to capture and decode wireless trafﬁc. In
the context of LoRaWAN, this sniffer can be used to collect a dataset and subsequently
investigate various aspects of the network, such as signal strength, coverage, data rates,
and communication protocols. These insights can help identify potential issues, evaluate
network deployments, and optimize conﬁgurations for better performance. To provide
the greatest ﬂexibility in analyzing the recorded packets, we selected Wireshark—a widely
recognized open-source network protocol analyzer.
Our research is guided by several key questions related to the dataset. Firstly, we aim
to determine which information can be extracted from captured real-world trafﬁc within
a LoRaWAN network, with particular attention to downlink trafﬁc and Class-B beacons.
Furthermore, we investigate how Class-B beacons and their optional extensions are used in
actual installations. It is also crucial to assess whether security and spectrum regulations
are followed in current LoRaWAN deployments. Another key aspect of our research is
to examine the accuracy and reliability of time synchronization in LoRaWAN, notably
regarding the Class-B beacons, and their susceptibility to interference and misconﬁguration.
Finally, we explore the potential for new applications of Class-B beacons.
Contribution of This Work
We collected and analyzed a large dataset [6] of real-world LoRaWAN trafﬁc from
four European locations. Unlike previous datasets [7–10], our collection includes uplink,
downlink, and Class-B trafﬁc. In the Results and Discussion section, we present an anal-
ysis that encompasses the Class-B beacons and highlights potential issues of LoRaWAN
deployments.
To obtain this dataset, we used a custom LoRaWAN hardware sniffer. Both the hard-
ware and software sources of this device are available online [11]. Recognizing the outdated
LoRaWAN protocol support in Wireshark, we enhanced its capabilities for decoding real-
world trafﬁc. These improvements are incorporated into the Wireshark development
branch and are now publicly accessible.
Furthermore, we proposed an innovative approach of using Class-B beacons as a
timebase source in urban environments. This method offers several advantages over
alternative time sources such as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), DCF77, and
Network Time Protocol (NTP), including better indoor reception, smaller and more cost-
effective antennas, and independence from internet connectivity.
Hence, the main contributions of this work are as follows:
•
it describes a novel LoRaWAN sniffer with open hardware design ﬁles and soft-
ware framework that allows capturing all LoRaWAN trafﬁc and its examination
in Wireshark;
•
it provides a large public dataset with real-world trafﬁc captured in multiple locations;
•
it analyzes the unencrypted part of captured packets, providing insights into network
operators, end device manufacturers, and LoRaWAN feature support;
•
it provides an analysis of Class-B beacons regarding precise timing and gateway
localization;

•
it points out to several identiﬁed issues, like invalid Class-B beacons, compromised
encryption keys, and invalid LoRaWAN trafﬁc;
•
it proposes the novel use of Class-B beacons as a timebase source.
2. Related Research
The IoT research community recognizes the signiﬁcance of real-world, quantitative
data for studying the network environments and deployments. Several LoRaWAN datasets
have been made available [7–10]. Bhatia et al. [7] gathered uplink packets from gateways in
the dense urban environment of London (UK). They included packet header information
and PHY layer properties reported by the gateways, making the dataset one of the largest
and most extensive [12]. Aernouts et al. [8] collected data focused on ﬁngerprint localization
in Antwerp (Belgium). Their dataset contains a large volume of traces with known end
device position.
Blenn et al. [9] presented an analysis of The Things Network (TTN), obtaining a
dataset of packets through the TTN Application Programming Interface (API) using a
known default network key. However, their ﬁndings were constrained to TTN uplink
trafﬁc due to its API limitations. Presently, the acquisition of such dataset is no longer
feasible due to the evolution of the TTN backend.
Choi et al. [10] developed LoRadar, a passive packet monitoring tool, and conducted
an analysis of trafﬁc within an anonymized city-wide area. Their study closely resembles
our research. However, they were limited to monitoring uplink sessions due to hardware
constraints. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has attempted to capture both
uplink and downlink simultaneously.
An overview of the existing sniffers is provided in [13]. These sniffers are limited
to a single RF channel [14] or employ one multichannel concentrator [9,10]. They are
either based on a gateway (concentrator type) [9,10] or developed using the GNU radio
(SDR-type) [15]. Software-Deﬁned Radios (SDRs) were deemed unsuitable due to high
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) requirements [15–17]. Recently, an SDR-based demodulator
competitive in SNR requirements was made available [18]. However, it still demodu-
lates one frequency and Spreading Factor (SF) per block, requiring over 100 differently
conﬁgured LoRa demodulator blocks for the intended sniffer functionality, which is com-
putationally demanding.
Other papers focus on simulating various LoRaWAN issues (overview in [19]) and
the deployment of custom experimental setups (controlled environments of nodes and
one or multiple gateways) [20,21]. Our work focuses on passive monitoring of real-world
trafﬁc, similar to [10], but also includes an important study of downlink messages and
Class-B beacons.
Time synchronization in LoRaWAN has been analyzed in several studies, such as [22,23].
Ramirez et al. [22] achieved an excellent time error below 10 µs using a custom protocol in
a Class-A network. Rizzi et al. [23] employed a posteriori synchronization, enabling time
sync with an uncertainty in the order of tens of milliseconds. No studies have suggested
passive listening to Class-B beacons for time synchronization.
3. Sniffer Design
The sniffer is based on commercially available modules, and its software is customized
for capturing network trafﬁc. It operates autonomously when connected to a power source,
storing the collected records locally and simultaneously transmitting them to a server over
the Long Term Evolution (LTE) modem.
To overcome the limitations of currently available devices, our new sniffer needs to
capture all LoRaWAN trafﬁc according to the EU868 frequency plan, including the RX2
channel [24]. This necessitates supporting both uplink and downlink reception, which
differ in the chirp signal polarity at the physical LoRa layer. Additionally, we aimed to
receive Class-B beacons transmitted on RX2 channel with a non-inverted chirp signal. The
combinations of these parameters are summarized in Table 1.

1 SF12 for the LoRaWAN standard, SF9 for The Things Network [26]. The sniffer supports all spreading factors.
2 Class-B beacons use implicit header mode with speciﬁc settings [24].
The sniffer is based on the industry-standard IMST iC880A LoRaWAN concentra-
tor [27], a hardware device designed for receiving and processing LoRa signals in LoRaWAN
network gateways. The module is equipped with a Semtech SX1301 digital baseband
chip [28] and two Semtech SX1257 RF front end chips [29], providing up to 10 programmable
parallel demodulation paths. It supports multiple LoRaWAN channels in the 868 MHz
frequency band, enabling the simultaneous reception of data from multiple end devices.
Additionally, the module is also capable of performing time-stamping of incoming packets,
which is essential for precise time synchronization.
The main baseband chip SX1301 provides eight LoRa demodulators with automatic
SF selection on IF0–IF7 signal paths. Moreover, an additional LoRa demodulator with
ﬁxed parameters and implicit header mode support, referenced as a SingleSF modem, is
available on the IF8 signal path.
There are several limitations introduced by the chipset. In the LoRa physical layer,
the modulated signal is represented by a chirp, which is a sinusoidal waveform whose
frequency increases or decreases linearly over time [4]. The SX1301 demodulator can only
detect chirps with one of two different polarities, each representing its inverse. Each LoRa
demodulator needs to know the polarity of a LoRa chirp signal in advance. As a result, at
least two iC880A concentrator modules need to be used for a simultaneous reception of
uplink and downlink transmission, each conﬁgured to demodulate a different chirp signal
polarity (GW #1 and GW #2).
The IF0–IF7 LoRa channels may be connected individually to radio front ends, ref-
erenced as Radio A or Radio B [27,28]. However, the useful bandwidth of SX1257 radios
is approximately only 925 kHz [30], assuming typical 125 kHz channels in the EU868
band [24]. This bandwidth is sufﬁcient for the simultaneous reception of all RX1 channels
using both front ends. Nevertheless, the RX2 channel operates at a signiﬁcantly different
frequency, making it impossible to receive using the typical conﬁguration. This is not an
issue for a standard concentrator, as it only transmits on RX2 without receiving. However,
for a sniffer, complete data reception is desired. To overcome this limitation, a third iC880A
concentrator must be added to the sniffer system (GW #3). This concentrator enables
reception in the RX2 downlink with one of its eight LoRa demodulators. Figure 1 illustrates
the relationship between channels, bands, and radio front ends.
Another goal of the sniffer is to receive Class-B beacons. These beacons are transmitted
on the RX2 frequency with speciﬁc parameters involving the implicit LoRa header [24].
Demodulation of the header is supported by the SingleSF modem on the IF8 signal path.
An implicit header refers to a packet format where the length of the packet is not explicitly
included in the packet header. Instead, the packet length is assumed to be ﬁxed and known
in advance. This reception is handled by the third concentrator module (GW #3).

Figure 2 shows the block diagram of our LoRaWAN sniffer. Initially, the radio signal is
received by an Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) omnidirectional antenna with a gain of 2 dBi
and vertical polarization. This signal is subsequently ﬁltered by a narrow bandpass ﬁlter,
ampliﬁed by a Low Noise Ampliﬁer (LNA), and then distributed to the inputs of three
iC880A modules via a power splitter. Table 2 outlines the function of each iC880A module.

A Raspberry Pi minicomputer serves as the central processing unit, which communi-
cates with the iC880A modules through its integrated Serial Peripheral Interfaces (SPIs).
In addition, it obtains the current time from a GNSS receiver module for accurate times-
tamping of the received packets. For this purpose, a 1 pps signal is distributed from the
GNSS module to all iC880A concentrators. The Raspberry Pi also has a Real Time Circuit
(RTC) connected to its I2C interface and an LTE modem connected via USB for remote
management and sending the measured data to the server. An external 24 V adapter powers
the whole device. Figure 3 shows the photo of the sniffer internal hardware. Complete
schematics and hardware design ﬁles are available online [11].
From a mechanical perspective, the complete LoRaWAN sniffer is enclosed in an
IP68-rated aluminum box, enabling safe outdoor installations. To accommodate the sniffer’s
requirement for GNSS-based time synchronization and LTE communication, an additional
plastic container conceals the GNSS and LTE antennas, eliminating the need for waterproof
external antennas. The two containers are securely bonded together and all openings are
sealed to maintain watertight integrity.

3.2. Sniffer Software Overview
The software relies on adapted open-source utilities supplied by Semtech, speciﬁcally
libloragw from the lora_gateway repository [30] and lora_pkt_fwd from the packet_-
forwarder repository [31]. The LoRa gateway library manages SPI communication between
the host computer and the SX1301 baseband chip. The packet forwarder employs the
gateway library to receive packets, incorporate detailed data, and transmit the packet via a
standardized UDP socket.
It was necessary to add support for handling multiple SPIs, switching chirp signal
polarity, receiving packets without a valid Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC), and decoding
the Class-B beacon implicit header. As a result, the packet forwarder was modiﬁed to parse
conﬁguration JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) ﬁles and pass the relevant settings to the
library, enhancing its versatility and adaptability. The complete software framework is
available online [11].
3.3. Data Processing
To address the limitations of original Wireshark LoRa encapsulation, we developed
an updated version of the LoRaTap header to efﬁciently manage the additional PHY
layer information, such as frequency channel, signal level, timestamp, and other relevant
details [32]. The sniffer’s JSON output produced by the packet forwarder utility can be
converted to the pcap format by conversion utility [11].
We also signiﬁcantly updated the Wireshark LoRaWAN dissector. Key enhancements
include the addition of a LoRaWAN Class-B beacon dissector, Join Accept decryption,
support for MAC commands from the LoRaWAN v1.0.4 speciﬁcation [5], and various
improvements to enable successful decoding of real-world trafﬁc captured by the sniffer.
These modiﬁcations are integrated into the development branch for future ofﬁcial release
and are currently available through the Wireshark automated builds [33].
3.4. Analysis and Decryption
Subsequent data processing can be performed manually in Wireshark or through
automated scripts in Wireshark’s console version, TShark. We employed an automated
approach for the quantitative analysis of captured packets. Data post-processing from the
TShark utility is executed with Python scripts, while ﬁnal statistical and visual processing
is carried out in MATLAB. The scripts are available online [11].
LoRaWAN packets are usually partially encrypted, with the keys generally unknown
to a sniffer device. However, there are several properties of LoRaWAN communication that
can be analyzed without knowing the decryption keys. The following ﬁelds of a LoRaWAN
packet are not encrypted:
Sensors 2023, 23, 7333
7 of 20
•
Message Header (MHDR): Contains information about the message type (MType) and
LoRaWAN version.
•
Device Address (DevAddr): A unique 32-bit identiﬁer for the end device within a
speciﬁc network.
•
Frame Control (FCtrl): Contains information about the Adaptive Data Rate (ADR),
Frame Options Length, and other control ﬂags.
•
Frame Counter (FCnt): A 16-bit counter value that increments with each uplink frame
to prevent replay attacks.
•
Frame Options (FOpts): Contains optional MAC commands.
•
Frame Port (FPort): Indicates the port number for application-speciﬁc or MAC layer
communication.
The application payload (FRMPayload) and Message Integrity Check (MIC) are en-
crypted for both uplink and downlink packets, requiring the corresponding keys for
decryption and veriﬁcation [5].
LoRaWAN activation processes include the Over-the-Air Activation (OTAA) and
Activation By Personalization (ABP). OTAA involves an end device transmitting a Join
Request, encrypted with a pre-shared Application Key (AppKey). The network server
veriﬁes the request, generates session keys, namely the Network Session Key (NwkSKey)
for the MIC and the Application Session Key (AppSKey) for the payload, and responds
with a Join Accept message, which includes the assigned Device Address (DevAddr). Given
the necessary keys, Wireshark can decrypt the join process packets, allowing for a more
comprehensive analysis.
ABP, on the other hand, involves pre-conﬁguring the end device with session keys
(NwkSKey and AppSKey) and a DevAddr, enabling immediate communication without a
join procedure. While this approach simpliﬁes the process, it may increase security risks
due to prolonged use of the same keys.
4. Results and Discussion
Data from the LoRaWAN networks were collected in four cities: Liege (Belgium), Graz
(Austria), Vienna (Austria), and Brno (Czechia). These cities were chosen for data gathering
due to various factors, such as their central European location, their prominence as major
urban areas with well-established LoRaWAN networks, and the intention to capture a
diverse range of city environments for data collection. Table 3 provides a summary of the
characteristics and details associated with each capture.

Ideal placement of the sniffer in Vienna and Brno is evident in the distribution of the
number of packets received in uplink, downlink, and independent downlink (RX2), as
depicted in Figure 4. To account for varying time periods across the datasets, packet counts
in all histograms were normalized to display the number of packets per day.

In Liege, the site is primarily characterized by the downlink trafﬁc—unconﬁrmed
data without a checksum, particularly on the RX2 channel. The Graz data also suggest
a suboptimal sniffer placement, as the sniffer predominantly captured downlink signals
from gateways (better positioned than nodes). Consequently, most of the received uplink
trafﬁc was discarded due to wrong checksums, as shown in Figure 4.
4.1. Selected Results of Data Post-Processing
Despite optimal sniffer placement in Vienna and Brno, a higher number of packets
was received in the downlink compared to the uplink. The distribution of valid LoRaWAN
message types is depicted in Figure 5. To determine the validity of real LoRaWAN messages,
the CRC veriﬁcation was applied at the physical LoRa packet level, and packet headers
were checked for errors. Payload checksums were veriﬁed for the Class-B beacons.
Suboptimal placement in Liege and Graz resulted in the reception of predominantly
downlink packets. Class-B beacons were observed in Brno, Liege, and Vienna. In some in-
stances, particularly in Liege, these beacons also conveyed additional information regarding
the geographic position of the gateway.
The Vienna dataset can be considered a representative source of data. The histograms
in Figure 6 demonstrate the identiﬁed transmission parameters. Spreading factors SF7 and
SF12 are dominant, with a coding rate of 4/5 required by the standard [24]. Channels are
occupied almost uniformly (except for the 867.5 MHz frequency), and most packets are
relatively short, with lengths of 12–19 bytes in the downlink and 20–40 bytes in the uplink.
The Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and the SNR conﬁrm the superior placement
of gateways compared to nodes in terms of radio coverage.

ADR is a feature that optimizes the data rate, transmission power, and airtime for
end devices based on their connectivity conditions [5]. In uplink frames, the ADR ﬂag
set by the end device indicates its support for the ADR feature and requests the network
server to manage its data rate and transmission power settings. When the ADR bit is set
in a downlink frame, it informs the end device that the network server can send ADR
commands. The ClassB ﬂag in the uplink packet header indicates to the network server that
the end device activated Class-B mode and is ready to receive scheduled downlink pings.
In accordance with the LoRaWAN standard, uplink and downlink packets are distin-
guished by the presence of payload CRC. While payload CRC is mandatory in the uplink
packets, the standard does not require it in the downlink, allowing for reduced airtime and
associated duty cycle for gateway transmissions [5]. However, the observed data indicate
that, aside from the Liege site, payload CRC is appended in the downlink by the majority
of LoRaWAN gateways.

4.2. Network Operators
The DevAddr ﬁeld serves as an identiﬁer for the end device within the LoRaWAN net-
work [5,34]. It is transmitted unencrypted in both the uplink and downlink. To determine
the network operator, we cross-referenced the preﬁx of DevAddr with the LoRa Alliance
list [35]. The corresponding ﬁndings are presented in Table 5, which highlights signiﬁcant
trafﬁc (over 400 packets per day) from various locations. Identifying the source gateway
from a captured downlink packet is infeasible without access to the network server because
it lacks explicit gateway-related information.

4.3. End Device Manufacturers
In addition to analyzing the network operators, we also examined the end device
manufacturers by analyzing the Device Extended Unique Identiﬁer (DevEUI) ﬁeld in the
Join Request messages. The DevEUI is a globally unique number assigned to a LoRaWAN
device and complies with the 64-bit Extended Unique Identiﬁer (EUI-64) format [5].
To identify the manufacturers of end devices within the captured dataset, we cross-
referenced the DevEUIs with the IEEE EUI-64 address space [36]. Table 6 presents the
results of this analysis, highlighting the major trafﬁc (over 10 join packets per day) from
different manufacturers.

4.4. Class-B Beacon Analysis
In a LoRaWAN Class-B network, gateways must be synchronized to broadcast the
Class-B beacons. Two possible modes of the transmission exist: tightly synchronized, with
gateways synchronized to Global Positioning System (GPS) time with an accuracy better
than 1 µs, allowing them to transmit beacons every 128 seconds; and loosely synchronized,
where gateways can synchronize with GPS time with an accuracy better than 1 ms but
not 1 µs, requiring randomized beacon transmission. Tightly synchronized gateways
capitalize on the single-frequency network, while loosely synchronized gateways utilize
randomization to counteract beacon interference caused by lower transmit timing accuracy.
To effectively ﬁlter the sniffer data, we utilized speciﬁc settings for beacon reception
at the LoRa physical layer. These settings include an implicit header mode, SF9BW125,
CR 4/5, no CRC, a payload length of 17 bytes, a preamble length of 10 symbols, and a
Sensors 2023, 23, 7333

non-inverted LoRa signal [24]. The payload comprises a timestamp (representing seconds
elapsed since the start of the GPS epoch) and a gateway-speciﬁc parameter (e.g., geographic
coordinates or network/gateway identiﬁcation). Each part is protected by an independent
CRC checksum.
Signiﬁcant differences were observed between the various locations included in the
dataset. Ideally, 675 beacons per day should be received, considering the beacon interval of
128 s and tightly synchronized gateways without transmitting randomization. As expected
due to interference, the actual numbers were lower. However, the data from Vienna and
Brno also contained a substantial number of packets violating the LoRaWAN standard, as
discussed in later sections.
Table 7 presents an analysis of the captured LoRaWAN Class-B beacons across different
locations. All packets included in the table have both of their CRC checksums valid. The
timestamp correctness was determined by comparing the precise time of the beacon arrival
and the timestamp value contained in its payload. No Class-B beacons were included in
the captured data from Graz.

The locations of Class-B gateways broadcasting their coordinates in the Liege and
Vienna datasets, as well as lines connecting each gateway to the respective receiving sniffer,
are depicted in Figure 7.

Figure 7. LoRaWAN sniffer placement and identiﬁed Class-B gateways beaconing its position in:
(a) Liege; (b) Vienna. Map source: “Mapy.cz”.
One of the most crucial pieces of data obtained was the accuracy of the beacon times-
tamps. Figure 8 displays the difference between the sniffer reference time, synchronized by
the 1 pps signal from the GNSS receiver, and the time of the received beacon packet. This
difference should ideally represent the beacon signal propagation delay. The time of the
received packet is adjusted by 154,143 µs to incorporate the following corrections:
•
1500 µs, the time delay speciﬁed in the LoRaWAN standard as TBeaconDelay [5];
•
152,576 µs, the beacon packet transmission time (calculated from the EU868 beacon
channel settings [24] with tool [37]);
•
67 µs, the empirically determined delay, likely due to sniffer signal processing.

For gateways that broadcast their geographic position as part of the beacon payload,
we calculated the distance from the sniffer and displayed it as triangular marks in Figure 8.
The ﬁgure reveals the low jitter in the arrival times of beacons across all sites, enabling the
identiﬁcation of individual gateways based on their distance from the sniffer. In addition
to the gateways conﬁrmed through the geographic coordinates, Figure 8 displays the
reception of two more gateways in Vienna (at distances of approximately 31 km and 58 km)
and a gateway in Brno (at a distance of approximately 90 km). It is important to note that
this distance calculation assumes tightly synchronized gateways. Gateways that appear
to be signiﬁcantly distant may be loosely synchronized, transmitting their beacons with a
small delay.
Figure 8. Time offset and corresponding distance between the GNSS reference and the received
Class-B beacons.
It is also evident that the beacons with invalid timestamps described earlier are in
close proximity to the sniffer. Considering the sniffer’s location on university campuses in
both Vienna and Brno, these gateways might be experimental and utilized for research and
development purposes.
4.4.1. Beacons in the Liege Region
At the Liege location, well-conﬁgured gateways were found near the border in the
Netherlands, speciﬁcally in the Maastricht and Haarlen area. A total of seven gateways
with unique coordinates were identiﬁed, situated between 15 and 36 km from the sniffer.
No gateways lacking the position or with invalid beacon frames were detected.
4.4.2. Beacons in the Vienna Region
Two nearby gateways broadcasting their geographic coordinates were identiﬁed.
Based on the timing analysis shown in Figure 8, it appears that two additional, more distant
gateways also contributed to beacon broadcasting.
However, alongside valid packets, a number of frames transmitted at incorrect times
were captured. The vast majority of these erroneous frames were offset by 18 seconds. This
offset is likely due to a faulty implementation of the conversion between the GPS time used
in Class-B beacons and the commonly used Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). GPS time
does not include leap seconds [38,39] and was synchronized to UTC on 5 January 1980.
In 2023, the number of leap seconds, i.e., the difference between GPS time and UTC, is
precisely 18 s.
Sensors 2023, 23, 7333
14 of 20
Although the majority of recorded beacons were either valid or shifted by 18 seconds,
the sniffer also recorded a signiﬁcant number (0.9%) of packets with different time shifts,
as demonstrated in Figure 9. The frames are always shifted by a whole number of sec-
onds, meaning their synchronization within a one-second window is maintained. These
packets are likely sent by a malfunctioning gateway, where the system clock is not correct,
even though the actual beacon transmission is initiated accurately by the 1 pps signal.
Together with the packets shifted by 18 seconds, they pose a signiﬁcant issue for Class-B
synchronization in the Vienna area and are likely to cause random network problems,
resulting in LoRaWAN downlink latency degraded to Class-A. In this situation, the Class-B
functionality of the end device depends on whether it synchronizes to a correct or invalid
signal during the beacon acquisition phase [40].
Figure 9. Difference between the actual reception time and the reported time in invalid Class-B
beacons from the Vienna dataset.
4.4.3. Beacons in the Brno Region
Two beacon signals were identiﬁed in the captured data from Brno. One correct signal
was received from a gateway with a time offset corresponding to an approximate distance
of 90 km from the sniffer’s location. No geographic coordinates that could conﬁrm this
distance were found, and approximately 0.1% of the frames were invalid.
Another beacon was identiﬁed at a distance of about 2 km. The timing information con-
tained in this beacon was incorrect, shifted by 315,964,782 seconds. This value corresponds
to the 315,964,800 s difference between the GPS and UNIX time. By subtracting the 18 leap
seconds from this difference, we obtain the observed time shift. In other words, the gateway
transmits a UNIX timestamp instead of the GPS time required by the LoRaWAN standard.
4.5. Channel Occupation and Duty Cycle Violations
LoRaWAN transmissions in the EU868 band must adhere to regulations speciﬁed in
the ETSI EN 300 220 standard [25]. The duty cycle limitations for end devices and gateways
vary depending on the speciﬁc frequency sub-bands. However, it should be noted that
these duty cycle limitations are only required if the Listen Before Talk (LBT) is not used:
•
band L, 865 MHz to 868 MHz, ≤1% duty cycle, includes RX1 channels 4 to 8;
•
band M, 868.000 MHz to 868.600 MHz, ≤1% duty cycle, includes RX1 channels 1 to 3;
•
band P, 869.400 MHz to 869.650 MHz, ≤10% duty cycle, includes RX2 channel.
The EU868 band is shared with other short-range devices that comply with the regu-
lations, typically employing narrow-band Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) and Amplitude
Shift Keying (ASK) modulations. We assessed the shared spectrum usage by calculating the
on-air time of each captured packet, a value derived from the spreading factor, bandwidth,
coding rate, preamble length, and packet length [37,41].
Sensors 2023, 23, 7333
15 of 20
Furthermore, we computed the total air time for all sites, separately for the uplink
and downlink, since different transmit directions utilize inverted, uncorrelated chirps. All
captured packets, including those with invalid CRCs, were considered in the calculation to
evaluate the total LoRa transmission time on the respective channel. The highest channel
occupation was observed at Vienna and Brno, as shown in Figure 10.
(a)
(b)
Figure 10. Channel utilization by LoRaWAN packets in (a) Vienna dataset; (b) Brno dataset.
Associating a downlink packet with a speciﬁc gateway is unfortunately not feasible.
Nonetheless, it is possible to calculate the uplink on-air time for individual end devices
based on their DevAddr ﬁeld. The ETSI EN 300 220 duty cycle limits are not applicable
to individual LoRaWAN channels; instead, they apply to speciﬁed bands that encompass
several adjacent channels.
Considering this criterion, we identiﬁed a total of eight devices in the Brno dataset
that, while adhering to the 1% duty cycle limitation on individual channels, exceed this
limitation by several times for the L and M bands (with duty cycles reaching up to 3.9%
for the L band and up to 2.6% for the M band). In the Vienna dataset, a single device
was discovered to violate the limitation (2.7% duty cycle in the L band). However, it is
worth noting that the devices we identiﬁed as exceeding the duty cycle limitation could
potentially be using the LBT strategy.
4.6. Compromised Encryption Keys
The captured data show that exposed encryption keys are used in existing LoRaWAN
networks. Semtech’s default key (2B7E151628AED2A6ABF7158809CF4F3C) [9] was identiﬁed
in the Brno dataset. This key is used as the AppKey for the OTAA by RisingHF devices by
default, according to the DevEUI identiﬁer. A signiﬁcant number of data packets (15.5%
of all valid packets) from ABP-activated devices in Brno use it as both the NwkSKey and
AppSKey. A smaller number of such devices were also discovered in the Vienna dataset
(0.2%).
Similarly, the Milesight default key (5572404C696E6B4C6F52613230313823) [42] was
identiﬁed in OTAA-activated devices across Vienna, Brno, and Liege, primarily utilizing
TTN. If an eavesdropper intercepts the entire Join Request–Join Accept pair, they could derive
the NwkSKey and AppSKey, enabling them to decrypt the entire communication of the
affected device.
A small number of packets in the Brno and Vienna datasets were also found to use the
empty key (00000000000000000000000000000000). In these cases, the devices appear to
be unconﬁgured or experimental.
4.7. Limited Front End Image Frequency Rejection
Strong packets can sometimes be received on two different channels with different
chirp polarities. This phenomenon arises due to the limited value of the Image Frequency
Sensors 2023, 23, 7333
16 of 20
Rejection Ratio (IMRR) of the radio front ends found in LoRaWAN gateways and the sniffer.
An example of this can be identiﬁed in packets #306 and #307 in the Brno dataset, with the
key characteristics depicted in Figure 11.

Figure 11. Duplicate packets with different chirp polarities in the Brno dataset.
The packets were received almost simultaneously, with a negligible 6 µs difference.
Frame #307 is a valid uplink transmission with a signal strength of −59 dBm and a non-
inverted chirp. Given a received frequency of 867.7 MHz and a front end center frequency
of 867.5 MHz (as shown in Table 1), we can anticipate a mirror signal at 867.3 MHz. This
is conﬁrmed by frame #306, which has a signal strength of −112 dBm. The difference of
53 dB corresponds to the IMRR value of the SX1257 front end employed in the sniffer.
Due to the signal spectrum inversion, such invalid packets can be easily identiﬁed by
the inverted chirp ﬂag, because data marked as uplink in the LoRaWAN header should not
be detected by the downlink sniffer. To ensure data accuracy, these packets were ﬁltered
out during processing. The described behavior could potentially overshadow a legitimate
weak packet at the mirror frequency. However, the likelihood of its occurrence is almost
negligible, given the low usage of the channels.
4.8. Invalid LoRaWAN Trafﬁc with Valid Checksum
LoRa packets at the PHY layer contain a Synchronization Word (SyncWord), which
serves to differentiate the contents of the following payload. The use of the SyncWord can
be confusing due to limited information from the manufacturer.
Semtech recommends only two SyncWord values: 0x12 for private networks, and
0x34 for public/LoRaWAN networks [41,43]. Documents from the LoRaWAN Alliance [24]
and certain source codes [30] imply that SyncWord 0x34 is designated for all networks
utilizing the LoRaWAN protocol at the MAC layer. This interpretation suggests that
both publicly and privately designed networks following the LoRaWAN standard should
employ SyncWord 0x34. The private SyncWord 0x12 appears to be reserved for devices
utilizing LoRa modulation at the PHY layer without engaging the LoRaWAN MAC layer.
The SyncWord setting is crucial for both modulation and demodulation, as the receiver
does not accept packets transmitted with a different SyncWord [44]. This issue is not
merely about discarding packets in the case of a mismatch; it arises from the inability to
synchronize on the preamble–SyncWord pair [45].
All datasets contain packets with errors that the LoRaWAN dissector cannot decode.
The Liege dataset includes a signiﬁcant number of invalid packets (4.7% of the total).
Invalid packets are identiﬁed by dissector errors or invalid MAC header entries, which
include a non-zero Reserved for Future Use (RFU) ﬁeld and a Major version that is not
equal to R1.
Receiving an invalid LoRaWAN packet can be attributed to a misconﬁguration of the
LoRa transmitter, which uses a custom payload for packets set with a public SyncWord. The
correct approach would be to use a dedicated private SyncWord, which appears to be the
issue occurring in the Liege dataset. Another possibility involves accepting invalid packets
that are erroneously evaluated as valid due to various factors. This could be attributed
to the limited reliability of the 16-bit payload CRC [41], which may occasionally fail to
identify packet corruption, or it could be due to the unwanted acceptance of packets with a
private SyncWord.
Sensors 2023, 23, 7333
17 of 20
The SyncWord issue was investigated in the InterOP project ATCZ175 [46], and its
results indicate a relatively low capability of the gateway to ﬁlter packets based on Sync-
Word. The success rate of receiving a private SyncWord packet when the gateway is set to
the public SyncWord depends on the signal strength and the SF used, with the possibility
of reaching up to 10%. Consequently, any trafﬁc with a private SyncWord may lead to the
observation of invalid packets in sniffer datasets.
4.9. Class-B Beacons as a Timebase Source
Class-B beacons in LoRaWAN networks have the potential to serve as alternative
timebase source in urban environments. Beacon receivers typically lock within 128 seconds,
providing excellent long-term stability, as their timing is usually derived from a GNSS
receiver. According to the LoRaWAN standard, beacon timing is accurate within ±1 µs,
while measurements taken by the sniffer without further optimizations revealed an accuracy
of ±5 µs. This accuracy is further reduced by the wireless propagation delay—every 300 m
of distance represents an additional 1 µs offset.
Compared to GNSS, Class-B beacons can be received indoors, making them suitable
for time synchronization in buildings and other structures where GNSS signals are weak or
unavailable. Unlike GNSS, Class-B beacons do not require a clear view to the sky, enhancing
their reliability in urban environments where tall buildings, trees, or other obstacles might
obstruct GNSS signals.
Class-B beacons also offer several beneﬁts compared to the DCF77, a Long-Wave (LW)
time signal broadcast from Germany. They exhibit high immunity to noise, making them
more reliable in urban environments where speciﬁc types of RF interference are common,
e.g., the LW interference affecting DCF77 signals. Class-B beacon receivers can use small,
cheap antennas, lowering the overall cost and making them more accessible for a wide
range of applications. Moreover, Class-B beacons have a similar lock speed to DCF77, with
a lock time of up to 128 seconds compared to DCF77’s typical lock time of 2–3 minutes [47].
Compared to NTP, Class-B beacons do not require an internet connection for time
synchronization, making them suitable for environments with limited or no internet ac-
cess. This independence from internet connections makes Class-B beacons a compelling
alternative for various applications.
To further enhance the lock time, a multichannel (e.g., SDR-based) device may listen
for Class-A downlink trafﬁc, which may contain the DeviceTimeAns time command in its
unencrypted MAC header. Despite the limited accuracy of ±100 ms as deﬁned in [5], this
may allow for a coarse lock. The listening device can also derive the time window for Class-
B beacon reception from this information, potentially reducing continuous receive time.
However, this proposed time synchronization may encounter difﬁculties if nearby
gateways transmit beacons that violate the LoRaWAN standard. Such issues have already
been observed in the Vienna and Brno regions, as previously discussed. Currently, no
method exists to verify the authenticity of a received beacon. Moreover, due to the harsh
RF environment, beacons may be disrupted by a wide-band UHF interference, resulting in
decoding errors and signiﬁcantly longer lock time.
Despite these challenges, by leveraging the beneﬁts of Class-B beacons, time syn-
chronization in urban environments can be signiﬁcantly improved. The indoor reception
capabilities, noise immunity, cost effectiveness, and independence from satellite availabil-
ity and internet connections make Class-B beacons an attractive alternative for existing
time synchronization methods, provided that the associated disadvantages can be effec-
tively managed.
5. Conclusions
In this study, we created an extensive, publicly available dataset encompassing com-
plete LoRaWAN trafﬁc from four European cities. This dataset enabled rigorous examina-
tion of real-world LoRaWAN network functionality. Our analysis revealed security and
system challenges, which include:
Sensors 2023, 23, 7333
18 of 20
•
invalid Class-B beacon packets, which pose a signiﬁcant synchronization issue and
are likely to cause random Class-B network problems;
•
default encryption keys from Semtech and Milesight in existing LoRaWAN installa-
tions, which pose a security risk;
•
end devices violating the duty cycle limitation for EU868 sub-bands, which could
potentially degrade the quality of service for other wireless devices.
We enhanced Wireshark’s LoRaWAN protocol dissector to accurately decode recorded
trafﬁc, including data and MAC command decryption for packets with known keys. These
improvements are now publicly accessible. Additionally, we proposed the use of Class-B
beacons as a timebase source in urban environments.
Future research should incorporate datasets from a broader range of locations to
enhance understanding of LoRaWAN networks. Additionally, addressing the issues related
to invalid Class-B beacons is a critical next step. Class-B devices currently allow the fallback
to Class-A when they experience difﬁculties in tracking the beacon. However, this depends
on the speciﬁc device implementation, since the documentation only suggests an initial
non-speciﬁc synchronization [5,40].
Validating received beacons remains a challenge. The beacon payload may contain
an optional network/gateway identiﬁcation. However, to the best of our knowledge, no
beacon ﬁltering implementation has been introduced yet. Another approach could involve
transmitting the initial synchronization over a secure channel, speciﬁcally within a unicast
packet with a MIC signature. This method can be employed to acquire the correct Class-B
beacon. While a solution that utilizes the DeviceTimeAns command to acquire coarse time
has been implemented, its use remains optional.
