1 | INTRODUCTION
Severe winter weather can place a strain on avian energetic re-
sources (Newton, 1998). Virtually all birds face a daily trade-­off 
between starvation and predation during winter: carry too little fat 
(energy) and they risk starving, carry too much fat and they reduce 
the speed of their escape response from predators (Bednekoff & 
Houston, 1994; Gosler, Greenwood, & Perrins, 1995). This trade-­off 
is influenced by the predictability of food sources (Lima, 1986). There 
is a lack of studies dealing with the effects of severe weather events 
on the regulation of energy reserves, and also with the indirect and 
additive effects of human activity on the survival of species during 
winter (including hunting) (Ferrand, Aubry, Landry, & Priol, 2013).
This is the case for the Eurasian woodcock Scolopax rusticola L. 
(hereafter woodcock), a widespread woodland specialist (Hoodless, 
1995) and long-­distance migrant, which leaves its breeding grounds in 
Scandinavia, Finland, the Baltic States and Russia for wintering areas 
in southern and western Europe in autumn (Hoodless et al., 2013;

Abstract
1.	 Severe winter weather can reduce avian energetic reserves. At such times, reduc-
ing disturbance, and therefore energy expenditure, through science-based policy 
is crucial to mitigating negative impacts on survival.
2.	 We used allometric equations to examine the energy reserves of Eurasian wood-
cock Scolopax rusticola, a popular quarry species across most of Europe, in relation 
to time of winter, location and temperature. We used data from 221 dissected 
birds, shot in Britain in two winters (2013/14, 2014/15), and 1,689 live birds cap-
tured during six consecutive winters (2010/11 to 2015/16).
3.	 Woodcock are able to store large amounts of energy as fat in mid-winter and in-
crease energy reserves as night air temperature drops to below 0°C, provided the 
ground thaws during the day.
4.	 In the event of cold weather in Britain, the mean potential flight distance of wood-
cock, based on mobilizable energy estimates of shot birds, is 860 km. If they do 
not move away, woodcock could withstand frozen conditions without feeding for 
a mean of 6 days.
5.	 Synthesis and applications. To reduce the effects of cold weather on Eurasian 
woodcock S. rusticola, shooting should be restricted before energy reserves are 
depleted. Current policies vary across Europe, but our results suggest that restric-
tions should come into force sooner, after 4 days of continually frozen ground at 
inland sites. Restrictions should cover large regions and remain in operation for 
7 days after the end of the cold spell.

SÁNCHEZ-­GARCÍA et al.
Thorup, 2006). It is widely hunted throughout its European winter-
ing areas, with around 2.3–3.5 million birds shot per year, mainly in 
France, Italy, Britain, Ireland and Spain (Guzmán & Arroyo, 2015; 
Lutz & Jensen, 2006).
In Europe, the woodcock is categorized as a species of “Least 
Concern” (Birdlife International, 2017), though there is evidence for 
declines in breeding numbers and range in Britain and Switzerland, 
probably owing to changes in woodland structure, intensification 
of agricultural practices and human disturbance (Estoppey, 2001; 
Heward et al., 2015). The species has been recently “Red listed” as 
a bird of conservation concern in the United Kingdom (Eaton et al., 
2015). Additionally, it has been demonstrated that shooting may 
be additive to natural mortality and affect population growth rate 
(Duriez, Eraud, Barbraud, & Ferrand, 2005; Péron et al., 2012), at 
a time when woodcock are susceptible to severe winter weather 
(Tavecchia et al., 2002).
To reduce the disturbance impact of shooting gamebirds under 
stress during cold spells, some European countries impose restric-
tions during these periods. In France, cold spells are defined as 
periods of at least 6–7 consecutive days when daily temperatures 
are 10°C below the seasonal average, minimum daily temperatures 
are below −5°C and maximum daily temperatures prevent thawing 
(MEDDTL, 2010). In Spain, shooting is banned when snow covers the 
ground (Agencia Estatal Boletín Oficial del Estado, 2015). In Great 
Britain, voluntary restraint in the shooting of wildfowl and waders 
is recommended after seven consecutive days of frozen conditions 
(determined as minimum daily air temperature <1°C and minimum 
daily grass temperature <−2°C) are recorded at more than half of a 
network of 25 coastal meteorological stations, although statutory 
suspension does not come into force until day 15. A “Protection 
Order” of 14 days is then enforced, although it can be revised after 
7 days (Ellis, 2012).
These measures are largely based on “best guesses” and in 
Britain are designed to protect a range of geese, ducks and waders 
(Stroud et al., 2006). Despite evidence of elevated mortality in pro-
longed cold weather, the relationships between the duration of cold 
spells, energy expenditure and mortality are poorly documented for 
most species (Davidson & Clark, 1985; Davidson & Evans, 1982). In 
addition, the effect of cold weather on energy expenditure in wood-
cock may differ from that on coastal waders because the woodcock 
is found largely inland, where temperatures are typically lower than 
at the coast but where it might benefit from reduced exposure by 
feeding in woodland (Hoodless, 1995).
The aim of this study was to examine variation in energy re-
serves, and hence the potential fasting endurance or escape flight 
distance, of woodcock during the winter and in relation to location 
and temperature. Because woodcock feed predominantly on soil 
invertebrates, particularly earthworms and leatherjackets in win-
ter (Granval, 1987), food abundance is unlikely to ever be limiting. 
Consequently, we hypothesize that woodcock should be able to in-
crease energy reserves at reduced temperatures until a threshold 
when access to food is limited because the invertebrates remain too 
deep or woodcock are prevented from probing. We use data from 
dissected birds, shot in winter, to examine individual variation in fat 
stores and the relationship between fat levels and body weight. We 
use data from live-­captured birds to assess changes in mobilizable 
energy in relation to season and weather. We discuss the implica-
tions for the suspension of hunting in cold weather.
2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 | Carcass dissection
A total of 221 woodcock collected from hunters during the winters 
of 2013/14 (n = 77) and 2014/15 (n = 144) were dissected. Birds 
were shot from early December to late January in four regions 
(Figure 1): Cornwall (pastoral land), Wessex (mixed farmland), East 
Anglia (predominantly arable farmland) and Scotland (mixed farm-
land). In 2013/14, 72 of the samples were from Cornwall but in 
2014/15 sample sizes were Cornwall 42, Wessex 13, East Anglia 50 
and Scotland 39. Shooting did not coincide with the main migration 
periods of foreign woodcock, which represent the majority of birds 
in winter (Hoodless & Coulson, 1994; Hoodless et al., 2013).
Carcasses were individually placed in labelled polythene bags 
and were frozen at −20°C within 10 hr of shooting. Six birds were 
dissected from fresh. After defrosting at 10–12°C for 1 day, birds

were weighed (±0.01 g) and wing length (maximum flattened 
chord ± 1 mm) was measured. Birds were sexed by dissection (ex-
cept one bird from Scotland) and aged by plumage characteris-
tics of the wing, being classified as first-­winter birds (<1 year old) 
or adults (>1 year old) (Ferrand & Gossmann, 2009). Birds were 
plucked and the abdominal fat and intestinal fat were dissected 
and weighed (hereafter referred to as dissected fat). The major 
and minor pectoral muscles were divided longitudinally along the 
sternum and the right half of these muscles was removed and 
weighed. This value was multiplied by two to obtain the total pec-
toral muscle mass. In four birds, pectoral mass could not be mea-
sured owing to shot damage.
2.2 | Capture of live birds
We caught woodcock at night from November to March, using 
a spot-­lighting technique (Gossmann, Ferrand, Loidon, & Sardet, 
1988), during the period 2010/11 to 2015/16, at one site support-
ing wintering immigrant woodcock (Ceredigion, mid-­Wales) and a 
site with mainly immigrants and some resident birds (Hampshire) 
(Hoodless, Lang, Aebischer, Fuller, & Ewald, 2009) (Figure 1). Birds 
were aged, ringed and weighed (±0.1 g), and wing length was 
measured (±1 mm). Woodcock were not sexed as current morpho-
metric methods are not capable of separating all birds, and the 
measures required for the method with greatest discriminatory 
power, separating up to 79% of birds, were not practical for when 
working alone at night (Aradis, Landucci, Tagliavia, & Bultrini, 
2015; Ferrand & Gossmann, 2009). We were not able to sex birds 
using molecular techniques. Effects of variables on energy re-
serves were examined for 549 woodcock captured in Hampshire 
and 1,140 in Wales (Table S1). Data for birds recaptured within 
30 days were excluded to avoid pseudo-­replication.
2.3 | Energy reserves and functional parameters
Total dry fat mass and dry protein mass were calculated from the 
fresh mass of abdominal and intestinal fat and from the fresh mass 
of pectoral muscles, respectively, for shot birds and from fresh 
weight for live-­captured birds, using allometric equations devel-
oped by Boos (2000) (Table S2). Mobilizable energy (ME), the en-
ergy (kJ) available when fasting in cold weather or for flying to 
milder areas, was estimated by multiplying the total dry fat and 
protein masses, minus the fat and protein remaining on woodcock 
starved to death during cold spells (Boos, 2000), by their caloric 
densities (39.6 kJ/g for dry fat and 18.0 kJ/g for dry protein, Jenni 
& Jenni-­Eiermann, 1998). Potential fasting endurance and escape 
flight distance were estimated from ME and standard calcula-
tions of basal metabolic rate and energy expenditure (Table S2). 
Estimation of fasting endurance followed the method of Boos 
(2000), involving daily recalculation of energy expenditure by fast-
ing birds, taking into account the daily loss of body mass and the 
masses of fat and protein catabolized for energy production per 
day.
2.4 | Weather data
Temperature data were obtained from weather stations <15 km from 
sites where birds were shot or ringed (http://www.wunderground.
com). We expected small local differences in temperature between 
shooting or ringing sites and weather stations to add noise to rela-
tionships rather than bias results. Because woodcock feed mainly 
at night in open habitats in winter (Duriez, Fritz, Binet, Tremblay, 
& Ferrand, 2005), we were interested in the effect of mean night 
temperature and wind chill index (determined from dusk and dawn 
times) on woodcock weights and ME levels. We extracted data for 
7 days before shooting or before birds were captured, based on typi-
cal rates of potential body weight increase in other waders. Mean 
night temperature and night wind chill index were correlated and so 
we used temperature in analyses, as recommendations based on the 
results are easier to implement.
To examine changes in ME during and after cold spells, we used 
data on live-­captured woodcock and identified days of freezing 
as those when the minimum daily temperature was below 0°C at 
the ringing sites. If two consecutive cold spells were separated by 
≤3 days, they were considered as the same one. This follows the 
procedure for counting frozen days up to the implementation of 
the UK “Protection Order” and observations during the 2010/11 
British cold spell were that the ground was only starting to thaw 
after 2 days, with temperatures of +3°C and +5°C (Prior & Kendon, 
2011). We distinguished three catching periods in relation to cold 
spells: “before” (captures 1–5 days before the onset of the cold 
spell), “during” and “after” (captures 1–5 days after the cold spell). 
We identified 17 cold spells during 2010/11–2015/16 when we 
had captured woodcock during the period from 5 days before to 
5 days after the freezing weather. To increase the sample size, we 
included data from two cold spells, in 2008/09 and 2009/10, at 
the Welsh ringing site. Mean cold spell duration was 7.3 ± 1.0 days 
(±SE), and mean minimum daily temperature during cold spells was 
−2.7 ± 0.3°C (±SE) (Table S3).
To examine cold spells across the main European wintering areas 
for woodcock, we extracted temperature data during November–
January 2007/08–2016/17 for three inland weather stations within 
each of five areas (http://www.wunderground.com, Table S4). 
We identified periods when minimum temperature was ≤−2°C for 
≥7 days, minimum and maximum temperatures were ≤−2°C and 
≤3°C for ≥4 days, and minimum and maximum temperatures were 
≤−5°C and ≤3°C for ≥4 days. One day of thaw with higher tempera-
tures was permitted, but not counted, for all periods.
2.5 | Statistical analysis
We found a difference in the wing length of woodcock between 
age classes (adults 2.2 mm longer than first-­winter birds) and sexes 
(males 2.2 mm longer than females) of shot birds (analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA) age F1,217 = 9.89, p = .002, sex F1,217 = 9.69, p = .002, 
age × sex F1,216 = 0.07, p = .788). There was a similar difference 
in the wing length of live-­captured adults and first-­year birds

(F1,1687 = 33.08, p < .001). Using wing length as a proxy for struc-
tural size, we, therefore, corrected all fresh weights and ME values 
using the overall mean wing length of 201 mm (new value = old 
value × (201/wing length)) to reduce variation and ensure that any 
differences between ages and sexes were attributable to behav-
ioural or physiological differences.
Data for shot birds were pooled for the two winters as the ma-
jority of the 2013/14 sample was from Cornwall, and there were no 
differences in fresh weight, dissected fat mass, pectoral mass or ME 
of Cornish birds between winters (Table S5). In shot birds, we used 
ANOVA to examine the effects of bird age, sex and sampling region 
on fresh weight, dissected fat mass, pectoral mass and ME. Similarly, 
we used ANOVA to examine the effects of age, month, winter and 
ringing site on ME of live-­captured birds. All interactions were tested 
in the full models and non-­significant interactions were dropped by 
orders to produce reduced models.
General linear models (GLM) with ME as the dependent vari-
able were used to examine relationships with mean night tempera-
ture prior to the shooting or capture of woodcock. Bird age and 
region (for shot birds) or ringing site (live-­captured birds) were 
included along with the interactions temperature × age and tem-
perature × region/ringing site. Non-­significant interaction terms 
were dropped in order of significance from the full model to pro-
duce a reduced model consisting of structural variables and signif-
icant interaction terms.
To examine changes in ME during cold spells, we first performed 
an ANOVA with catching period, bird age and ringing site as factors 
and tested all interactions. Then, for captures during cold spells, we 
used a GLM with ME as the dependent variable to examine rela-
tionships with days since the start of the cold spell (hereafter cold 
spell days) and lowest night temperature. The full model included 
bird age and ringing site, their interactions with cold spell days and 
lowest temperature and the interaction cold spell days × lowest 
temperature. Non-­significant interaction terms were dropped se-
quentially to produce a reduced model with main effects and signif-
icant interaction terms.
All statistics were calculated in GENSTAT v18.1 (VSN 
International, Hemel Hempstead, UK). Residuals were checked for 
normality and homoscedasticity of variances.
3 | RESULTS
3.1 | Variation in body weight, dissected fat mass 
and pectoral mass
In shot birds, fresh weight was correlated with dissected fat mass 
(n = 221, r = .68, p < .001) and the sum of dissected fat and pecto-
ral mass (n = 217, r = .71, p < .001). Dissected fat mass was weakly 
correlated with pectoral mass (n = 217, r = .33, p < .001). Region had 
the largest effects on fresh weight and dissected fat mass (Table 1). 
Higher mean regional values of fresh weight and dissected fat mass 
corresponded with lower mean region temperature for December 
and January (Scotland 3.0°C, East Anglia 4.2°C, Wessex 4.9°C, 
Cornwall 7.3°C, source: www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/ 
climate). Male woodcock were lower in weight than females, owing 
to smaller pectoral muscle mass rather than a difference in fat mass. 
Bird age only affected fat mass, with adults carrying more fat than 
first-­winter birds.
3.2 | Mobilizable energy, fasting endurance and 
flight distance
For all shot birds, the contribution of fat to ME ranged from 68% 
for fresh weights of 231–250 g to 82% for weights of >371 g 
(Figure 2). Among shot birds, adults had higher ME values than first-­
winter birds (Table 2), although the difference was small (Table 3).

Consequently, adults were only able to survive 0.8 days longer, or fly 
around 95 km further, on average, than first-­winter birds. Woodcock 
in Cornwall had significantly lower ME values than birds from the 
other three regions (Tables 2 and 3). All birds were able to fast for at 
least 3 days, and fasting endurances were (mean ± SE) 5.0 ± 0.1 days 
for Cornish birds and 6.4 ± 0.2 days for birds from the other regions 
(Figure 3). Alternatively, all birds were able to make escape flights of 
at least 600 km, and Cornish birds could have made escape flights of 
(mean ± SE) 781 ± 11 km, compared with 941 ± 19 km for birds from 
other regions (Figure 3).
Among live-­captured woodcock, adults had higher mean ME 
than first-­winter birds (Tables 2 and 3). Mobilizable energy var-
ied between months and across winters (Table 2). Mean ME was 
similar among woodcock caught in Hampshire and in mid-­Wales, 
and two peaks in ME were recorded at both sites: one in 
December–January and the other in March (Table 2, Figure 4). 
If woodcock do not move with the onset of cold weather and 
endure continuous frozen conditions without feeding for 4 days, 
80% of shot birds and 93% of live birds may survive, but if they 
fast for 7 days, only 9.5% (shot birds) to 22% (live-­captured birds) 
may survive.
3.3 | Effects of temperature on mobilizable energy
For shot birds with known shooting date (Table S6), we found no 
relationship between ME and mean night temperature for the pre-
ceding seven nights when region was included in the GLM (Table 4).

such that there was a difference in mean values and the range for 
Cornwall was almost exclusive of the ranges for the other regions 
(Table S7). With region excluded from the model, we found a nega-
tive relationship across the range of temperatures +0.4 to +9.3°C 
(Table 4). For live-­captured woodcock, ME was negatively related to 
mean temperature during the previous seven nights within the range 
−1.0 to +13.2°C (Table 4).
The effect of cold spells on ME levels of live-­captured wood-
cock was small, with a 6.7% drop in ME during cold spells relative 
to the 5 days before they started (mean ± SE; before 2,142 ± 51 kJ 
(n = 89), during 1,998 ± 63 kJ (n = 60), after 2,095 ± 52 kJ (n = 88)). 
There was no difference in ME between catching periods (catching 
period F1,232 = 1.57, p = .210, bird age F1,232 = 4.22, p = .041, ringing 
site F1,232 = 3.12, p = .079, interactions not significant; see Figure S1 
for detail of variation in ME).
During cold spells, we found a weak interaction effect between 
cold spell days and the lowest temperature on ME, indicating that 
ME was lower during longer, colder periods (Table 5). There were 
also weak interactions between bird age and lowest temperature 
and between cold spell days and ringing site (Table 5). Between −2°C

and −8°C, adults were better able to maintain their energy reserves 
than first-­winter birds (Figure S2). In the case of days since start of 
the cold spell, we observed a strong negative relationship between 
ME and cold spell days in Hampshire, but no significant relationship 
in Wales (Figure S2).
3.4 | Cold spells across woodcock wintering areas
Cold spells were infrequent during the 10 years 2007/08 to 2016/17, 
mainly occurring in two winters (2009/10 and 2010/11). Numbers of 
cold periods did not vary appreciably between countries but durations 
were typically longer in Scotland and England than in France, Spain or 
Italy (Table 6). Maximum temperature during cold spells was lower in 
Scotland and England than in the other regions (Table 6).
4 | DISCUSSION
Woodcock stored high amounts of energy in winter as fat, which 
agrees with a previous study conducted in France (Boos, Boidot, & 
Robin, 2005). Literature on waders in the northern hemisphere indi-
cates that many species regulate their body mass seasonally and in 
relation to short-­term fluctuations in temperature. As frost reduces 
the ability of woodcock to probe the soil and capture earthworms,

their most important prey (Granval, 1987; MacDonald, 1983), it seems 
plausible that falling temperature triggers greater energy storage to 
meet the increased thermoregulatory demand and as a precaution 
against starvation. This most likely explains the higher energy val-
ues in shot woodcock from Wessex, East Anglia, and Scotland com-
pared with birds from Cornwall, and the first peak in energy storage 
observed in live-­captured birds in December–January.
Woodcock should be able regulate energy reserves efficiently 
when the ground is not frozen because they can shelter in wood-
land by day and reduce energy expenditure, as wind has less of an 
exposure effect than on coastal waders (Mitchell, Scott, & Evans, 
2000). A radio-­tracking study employing tilt-­switch activity trans-
mitters found that woodcock only needed to feed for 3.5–5.0 hr 
per day in mild conditions, when able to feed on fields at night, 
to satisfy their daily energy need (Duriez, Fritz, et al., 2005). 
Although feeding areas inland are likely to freeze before those at 
the coast, woodcock may still have the option of feeding in wood-
land or beside unfrozen streams during the day when the ground 
freezes at night. Feeding in woodland is not likely to deliver the 
same energy intake per unit time, owing to lower food availabil-
ity than in fields (Hoodless & Hirons, 2007), but the temperature 
will probably need to be sufficiently low to keep the ground fro-
zen for a substantial part of the day before woodcock start to be 
impacted.
Once permanently frozen conditions set in, our data suggest that 
there is the potential for woodcock to starve to death within a week. 
In France, it is known that cold spells increase woodcock mortal-
ity (Gossmann & Ferrand, 1998; Lormée et al., 2013; Péron et al., 
2011). The temperature inland is, on average, 3°C lower than at the 
coast (www.metoffice.gov.uk). So a day counted as frozen at the 
coast under the UK statutory cold-­weather suspension system (min-
imum air temperature below 1°C) will typically equate to a minimum 
daily temperature below −2°C inland. Mean daily minimum tem-
perature during the cold spells for which we have data was −2.7°C, 
and mean mobilizable energy reserve during these periods was still 
1,998 ± 63 kJ, compared with the mean estimate at starvation of

780 kJ. Our data, therefore, suggest that woodcock were able to 
cope adequately with these temperatures.
Examination of our cold spell data indicated that a minimum 
daily temperature of −2°C equated to a mean daily temperature 
of +2°C, suggesting that the ground was sufficiently thawed for 
long enough in the day for woodcock to almost maintain their en-
ergy levels. Measures of soil penetrability indicate that grass fields 
start to become too hard for woodcock to probe below −2.5° and 
cereal fields and stubbles are impenetrable at this temperature (A. 
Hoodless, unpubl. data). Under the conditions experienced in the 
cold spells which we monitored, our data suggest that after 7 days 
of cold weather, the trigger for “voluntary restraint” in shooting 
under the UK system, woodcock would have lost on average 33 g 
fresh weight and after 15 days, the point at which a statutory sus-
pension of shooting would come into force, they would have lost 
on average 70 g. At this time mean woodcock weight would have 
dropped to about 255 g and birds would have about 1,428 kJ mobi-
lizable energy. Lower temperatures than those encountered in our 
study would impact woodcock reserves more rapidly, and minimum 
temperatures below −5°C would prevent the ground thawing during 
the day and prevent woodcock feeding in Scotland and England 
(Table 6). The effects on woodcock documented during cold spells 
in France occurred when minimum daily temperatures were below 
−5°C (Gossmann & Ferrand, 1998; Lormée et al., 2013). Our data 
suggest that first-­winter woodcock may be affected disproportion-
ately if cold spells involve very low temperatures.
Studies are needed on the behaviour of woodcock at the onset 
of cold spells, to understand conditions under which they are un-
able to feed. We know that some woodcock move from their reg-
ular winter sites when daytime temperatures fall below 3°C, as 
recorded in Hampshire with the departure of radio-­tagged birds in 
January 2009, December 2009 and January 2010 (Powell, 2012). 
One of these birds was recovered c. 100 km to the south-­west 
shortly after departure. In this study, resident woodcock (deter-
mined from stable-­isotope analysis) remained on site throughout 
the cold spells, while migrants largely departed (Powell, 2012). 
Hence, shooting during these periods would have had a dispropor-
tionate impact on local breeders. As shown in Eurasian cranes after 
an extreme flooding event in Britain (Grus grus) (Soriano-­Redondo 
et al., 2016), it is unlikely that woodcock populations would col-
lapse in a single year, and woodcock hunting disturbance may 
be low owing to the nocturnal behaviour of the species (Ferrand 
et al., 2013). But indirect effects resulting from movements to 
avoid severe weather conditions may occur owing to the increased 
energy expenditure and predation risk (including hunting) at the 
new wintering sites. Some of the relatively new technologies now 
available for smaller birds, such as GPS tags and accelerometers, 
could be used to improve our knowledge of woodcock behaviour 
during cold weather.
Although the British cold-­weather shooting policy is broadly 
appropriate for protecting woodcock, there is potential for sub-
stantial mortality before the triggering of “voluntary restraint” or 
the statutory suspension of hunting if weather conditions result 
in continuous frozen ground, because the species’ mean fasting 
endurance is 6 days. In reality, many birds are likely to fly south 
and west where possible (Péron et al., 2011) and may be able 
to find unfrozen ground to feed. However, there is currently no 
alert within the British cold-­weather shooting policy for condi-
tions leading to frozen ground inland. Indeed, there is no common 
approach between countries within the wintering range to cold-­
weather shooting restrictions. We suggest that shooters across 
Europe should adopt a more cautious approach to shooting wood-
cock in cold weather and should stop after 4 days of frozen con-
ditions and allow the birds at least 7 days to recover after the end 
of the cold period before shooting recommences. Another simple 
guideline for shooters would be to stop shooting woodcock when 
woodcock weights are below 270 g. In practice, shooting in the 
United Kingdom is likely to be restricted more frequently than 
elsewhere in Europe, but this change would not result in many 
more days when shooting is not permitted than under the current 
UK cold-­weather suspension system and would afford woodcock 
better protection.
4.1 | Management and policy implications
(i) In the event of cold spells anywhere in Europe, woodcock 
shooting at a regional level should be restricted before the end of 
the fasting endurance period. (ii) We suggest a common shooting 
restraint policy, such that an alert to stop shooting woodcock is 
issued after 4 days of permanently frozen ground at inland sites. 
This should ensure the survival of around 80% of birds during fro-
zen conditions. (iii) A “Protection Order” following a thaw, as fol-
lows the current UK statutory suspension, is important and should 
last at least 7 days. (iv) Policy makers should consider a system for 
halting woodcock shooting in any winter if there are more than 
two cold spells.
