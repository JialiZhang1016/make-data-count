Abstract
Background: Bud dormancy is a sophisticated strategy which plants evolve to survive in tough environments.
Endodormancy is a key obstacle for anti-season culture of tree peony, and sufficient chilling exposure is an effective
method to promote dormancy release in perennial plants including tree peony. However, the mechanism of
dormancy release is still poorly understood, and there are few systematic studies on the metabolomics during
chilling induced dormancy transition.
Results: The tree peony buds were treated with artificial chilling, and the metabolmics analysis was employed at
five time points after 0–4 °C treatment for 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 d, respectively. A total of 535 metabolites were
obtained and devided into 11 groups including flavonoids, amino acid and its derivatives, lipids, organic acids and
its derivates, nucleotide and its derivates, alkaloids, hydroxycinnamoyl derivatives, carbohydrates and alcohols,
phytohormones, coumarins and vitamins. Totally, 118 differential metabolites (VIP ≥1, P < 0.05) during chilling
treatment process were detected, and their KEGG pathways involved in several metabolic pathways related to
dormancy. Sucrose was the most abundant carbohydrate in peony bud. Starch was degradation and Embden
Meyerhof Parnas (EMP) activity were increased during the dormancy release process, according to the variations of
sugar contents, related enzyme activities and key genes expression. Flavonoids synthesis and accumulation were
also promoted by prolonged chilling. Moreover, the variations of phytohormones (salicylic acid, jasmonic acid,
abscisic acid, and indole-3-acetic acid) indicated they played different roles in dormancy transition.
Conclusion: Our study suggested that starch degradation, EMP activation, and flavonoids accumulation were
crucial and associated with bud dormancy transition in tree peony.

Background
The bud dormancy of woody plants is a complex process
that allows plants to survive in harsh environments such
as cold and drought, and it is classified as paradormancy,
endodormancy, and ecodormancy [1], of which endodor-
mancy is regulated by internal factors [2]. Endodor-
mancy
also
has
an
important
impact
on
the
maintenence and producction of the plant, for instance,
the anti-season cultivation of some fruit trees. Thus,
much attention has been attracted to understand the
mechanism of dormancy regulation. External environ-
mental factors, short-day and low temperature, play an
essential role in endodormancy induction, and sufficient
low temperature accumulation is a necessary prerequis-
ite to bud break [3–5]. In Paeonia lactiflora, low
temperature accumulation at 5 °C for nine weeks was re-
quired to ensure the re-growth of buds [6]. Also, the
buds of tree peony ‘Luhehong’ need to undergo 21 d
chilling at 0–4 °C to ensure the following normal devel-
opment at growth condition [7]. In addition, the require-
ments of chilling unit are in a genotype dependent
manner [8], and significantly different among apical
buds, lateral buds and catkins in Persian walnut (Juglans
regia L.) [9].
Many studies have been performed on the mechanism
of bud dormancy release, such as genomics, transcripto-
mics,
proteomics
and molecular biological
analysis.
These results indicated that vast changes in the metabol-
ism including carbohydrate inter-conversion and trans-
port,
lipid
mobilization,
nitrogen
metabolism,
phytohormone metabolism and redox processes are as-
sociated with chilling induced buds dormancy break [8,
10–13]. Till now, there is still rare study on the system-
atic changes of metabolites and their crosslinks during
chilling induced dodormancy transition.
Carbohydrates play multiple roles in plant growth and
development, besides acting as the primary source of
carbon and energy. Before oxidative phosphorylation,
Embden Meyerhof Parnas (EMP), Tricarboxylic Acid
(TCA), and Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP) are the
main respiration pathways in plants. EMP starts from
glucose, which is an end product of starch degradation.
Additionally, maltose and fructose also involve in the
EMP pathway after conversion to glucose. The anabolic
metabolism of sucrose is mainly carried out by two en-
zymes, sucrose synthase (SUS; EC 2.4.1.13) and invertase
(INV; EC3.2.1.26) [14]. SUS reversibly catalyzes the for-
mation of sucrose from UDP-glucose and fructose [15],
and INV, which irreversibly decompose sucroses into
hexose, can be divided into three categories: cell-wall in-
vertase (CWIN), vacuolar invertase (VIN), and cytoplas-
mic invertase (CIN) [16, 17].
It had been reported that EMP, TCA, and PPP are
strictly related to dormancy release in different plants.
For example, the TCA cycle is enhanced, while the PPP
pathway slowly decreased during apple bud sprouting
[18]. In grape, dormancy release induced by chemical
and low temperature was found related to PPP, EMP,
and TCA cycles [19–21]. Furthermore, carbohydrates
could also act as a sugar signaling molecule. Mason
et al. (2014) found that sucrose could serve as a signaling
molecule involved in paradormancy release [22].
Flavonoids are widespread secondary metabolites in
plants, which mainly contain six subclasses: chalcones,
flavones,
flavonols,
flavandiols,
anthocyanins,
and
proanthocyanidins or condensed tannins [23]. The path-
way of flavonoid biosynthesis is quite conservative and
well understood in some model plants [23]. Some genes
involved in the production of common precursors, such
as chalcone synthase (CHS), chalcone isomerase (CHI),
flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H), and flavonoid 3′-hydrox-
ylase (F3’H), are called Early Biosynthetic genes (EBGs).
Correspondingly, downstream genes for flavonoid bio-
synthesis are called Late Biosynthetic genes (LBGs). The
pathway of flavonoids biosynthesis can be affected by bi-
otic
and
abiotic
factors
(e.g.,
pathogen
infections,
temperature, drought, plant hormones) [24]. Moreover,
recent reports had shown that flavonoids involved in
plant stress response [25], pollen development [26],
color formation [27], etc. However, it is still unknown
whether flavonoids participate in the process of dor-
mancy release.
It is well known that external factors always work
through internal factors during bud dormancy release,
and hormones play an important role in dormancy regu-
lation. With the extension exposure to dormancy-
inducing conditions (short-day or low temperature), the
expression of growth-promoting signals gene (FLOWER-
ING LOCUS T, FT) is inhibited, leading to reduce gib-
berellins (GAs) levels and increase abscisic acid (ABA)
contents, and the ABA response could induce the close
of plasmodesmata, thereby mediating the establishment
of dormancy [28, 29]. GA and ABA not only involve in
the establishment of growth cessation, but also play a
key role in dormancy release. During dormancy release,
the reopening of plasmodesmata could restore the sup-
ply of growth-promoting signals with the increasing bio-
synthesis
of
GAs
[30].
On
the
other
hand,
the
degradation of ABA is necessary for bud dormancy re-
lease in grapes, while ABA is accumulated during dor-
mancy establishment [31]. The recent reports showed
that SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP)-like (SVL)
with sequence homology to the Dormancy Associated
MADS-box (DAM) genes [32], plays a vital role in the
dormancy of poplar [33]. Low-temperature decreases
ABA levels and reduces SVL expression, leading to the
induction of FT1 expression and GA biosynthesis, which
promotes dormancy release.

Tree peony (Paeonia suffruticosa Andr.) belonging to
the Moutan subfamily of the genus Paeonia, Paeonia-
ceae, is one of the most ancient ornamental and medi-
cinal plants in the world. The bud of tree peony is a
typical compound bud with scale forming in autumn
[34], and it must undergo a period of low temperature
to ensure the sprouting and flowering in the next year.
Due to the short and concentrated florescence every
year, its anti-season culture becomes an important con-
tent of the tree peony industry. Until now, the primary
method of anti-season production is to provide sufficient
low temperature exposure alone or chilling enduration
combining with gibberellin application. Therefore, it is
of great value to understand the mechanism of chilling
induced dormancy release in tree peony. Our previous
study characterized the relationship between chilling ac-
cumulation and dormancy status, the physiological sta-
tus
of
tree
peony
‘Luhehong’
after
14
d
chilling
treatment was regarded as the transition stage from
endodormancy to endodormancy release, and that after
21 d chilling treatment was defined as dormancy release,
and after 28 d chilling as a stage of ecodormancy [35].
GA pathway plays a crucial role in endodormancy re-
lease induced by chilling [36]. And the activity of PPP
pathway also increases during the process, suggesting
that it play a role in dormancy release of tree peony [7].
As known, traits are more closely related to metabolites,
which may provide a new perspective for the under-
standing of dormancy transition in tree peony.
Here, metabolic changes of tree peony buds during the
chilling induced dormancy transition were analyzed.
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) en-
richment analysis showed that differential metabolites
involved in various metabolic pathways such as carbon
metabolism, secondary metabolite synthesis, and hor-
mone metabolism. It was revealed that starch degrad-
ation and EMP activity were enhanced during dormancy
release. Interestingly, flavonoids anabolism was also acti-
vated by chilling accumulation, and its increasement
might in return promote flower bud development. Fur-
thermore, the concentration of plant hormones, such as
ABA, jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA),and indole-
3-acetic acid (IAA) during the dormancy transition were
also evaluated in this research. Significantly, the roles of
flavonoids were firstly discussed during the dormancy
transition in perennial plants. All results would provide
valuable information for the molecular mechanism of
dormancy transition in tree peony.
Results
Metabolomics analysis during chilling induced dormancy
transition
To study the metabolic changes during chilling-induced
dormancy release in tree peony, flower buds were picked
at five time points after 0–4 °C treatment for 0, 7, 14, 21
and 28 d, respectively, and metabolic profiling was ana-
lyzed
by
ultra-performance
liquid
chromatography
(UPLC)
and
tandem
mass
spectrometry
(MS/MS)
(Fig. 1a). The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) ana-
lysis was employed to evaluate the repeatability of the
metabolite profiles (Fig. 1b). As shown, quality control
(QC) samples were separated from tested samples, and
the two principal components (PC) accounted for 28.8%
(PC1) and 14.5% (PC2) of the total variance, respectively.
The samples were clearly separated into the 5 different
subgroups by PC1 and PC2 (Fig. 1b).
A total of 535 metabolites were detected in the meta-
bolomic analysis, and 511 of them were annotated with
MassBank, KNAPSAcK, HMDB [37], MoTo DB and
METLIN [38] (Table S1). The metabolites were divided
into eleven groups, including flavonoids, amino acid and
its derivatives, lipids, organic acids and its derivates, nu-
cleotide and its derivates, alkaloids, hydroxycinnamoyl
derivatives, carbohydrates and alcohols, phytohormones,
coumarins, and vitamins (Table 1). Notebly, 123 flavo-
noids and derivates and 15 phytohormones were anno-
tated
(Table
S1),
which

their
function. The results of metabolic pathway analysis
showed that they were mapped to 14 KEGG pathways
(Fig. 1c), of them, totally 183 metabolites were assigned
to the pathway of global and overview, followed by
amino acid metabolism with 85, biosynthesis of other
secondary metabolites numbered 82, metabolism of co-
factors and vitamins numbered 33, nucleotide metabol-
ism, carbohydrate metabolism amounted 33, and so on
(Fig. 1c).

Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA, VIP ≥1) and the Stu-
dent’s t test (P < 0.05) were applied to detect the differ-
ential metabolites (DMs) among different treatments
(Fig. S1). Totally, 118 DMs were obtained when the
chilling treated groups were compared with that of 0 d
samples. The results also indicated that the amounts of
up-regulated metabolites increased along with the in-
crease of chilling days (Fig. 2a). In detail, the number of
up-regulated metabolites were 4, 18, and 29 when 14 d
vs 0 d, 21 d vs 0 d, and 28 d vs 0 d, respectively. There
were not regular trend for the number of down-
regulated metabolites when compared with 0 d. The
results indicated that some metabolism pathways were
activated by the prolonged chilling exposure. Interest-
ingly, the number of up-regulated metabolites decreased
when comparing 14 d vs 0 d with 7 d vs 0 d. To better
understand the metabolites changes caused by different
chilling durations, the venn diagram of 118 DMs was
constructed,

common among the four comparisons, i.e. 7 d vs 0 d, 14
d vs 0 d, 21 d vs 0 d, and 28 d vs 0 d (Fig. 2b; Fig. S2).
Besides, 30 metabolites were unique in 28 d vs 0 d, im-
plying that wider changes happened in this group. The
KEGG pathway annotation of 118 DMs was performed
and the DMs involved in amino acid metabolism (24 in
number), nucleotide metabolism (16), and biosynthesis
of other secondary metabolism (15), and so on (Fig. 2c).
Additionally, KEGG enrichments between each two
treatments were listed in Fig. S3. Carbohydrate metabo-
lisms, such as pyruvate metabolism, starch and sucrose
metabolism, PPP pathway and so on, were frequently
presented in the different enrichments analysis. Plant
hormone signaling transduction was also enriched in 7
comparable groups. Besides above, several amino acid
metabolisms, pyrimidine and purine metabolism, nitro-
gen
metabolism
and
others
were
also
frequently
enriched in the comparations (Fig. S3).
The metabolic processes related to dormancy release in
tree peony
To study the crucial metabolic processes related to
endodormancy release in tree peony, DMs of 14 d vs 7d
and 21 d vs 7 d were screened. Totally, 50 DMs were ob-
tained and presented in a clustering heatmap, which
showed the metabolites change from the dormancy to
dormancy release (Fig. 3a). Among them, 21 DMs were
significantly up-regulated, 18 DMs were down-regulated

with the prolonged chilling enduration, and the other 11
DMs fluctuated with a peak at 14 d. The KEGG analysis
of the 50 DMs showed that 25 DMs participated in the
metabolic pathway, which accounted for 83.33% of all
the 30 annotated metabolites (Fig. 3b, Table S2). The
KEGG enrichment anaylsis of 25 DMs showed that they
involved in the pathways of glucose metabolism (glucose
6-phosphate), amino acid metabolism (aspartate) and
hormone metabolism (ABA) (Table S3), suggesting that
these metabolic pathways might play a critical role dur-
ing dormancy release in tree peony.
Carbon metabolism during dormancy transition in tree
peony
A metabolic network containing EMP pathway, TCA
cycle, shikimate pathway, and amino acid metabolism was
presented to visualize the carbon flow during dormancy
release of tree peony (Fig. 4). The levels of glucose at 0, 7,
14 and 21 d were lower than that at 28 d. However, glu-
cose 6-phosphate (G6P) and fructose 6-phosphate (F6P)
had the higher levels at 7 and 14 d (Fig. 4), indicating that
the EMP was activated during chilling induced endodor-
mancy release in tree peony. In the TCA cycle, the levels
of citrate declined until 14 d and then climbed. The succi-
nic acid amount showed an significant upward at 14 d. In
terms of amino acid metabolism, some amino acids in-
creased with the release of endodormancy, such as leucine,
proline, etc., while some others decreased, such as valine,
aspartic acid, glutamic acid, etc. (Fig. 4). In the shikimic
acid pathway, the level of shikimic acid and phenylalanine
increased after chilling exposure (Fig. 4).
The variation of carbohydrates during dormancy
transition
Sugars play crutial roles in energy metabolism and sub-
stance metabolism, whose variation might reflect the

status of bud dormancy after chilling exposure. The
levels of 15 sugars in metabolic profiles were analyzed
throughout
the
dormancy
process
(Fig.
5a).
Some
monosaccharide (G6P, glucosamine, and trehalose 6-
phosphate) and polysaccharides (maltotetraose, melezi-
tose, and melezitose O-rhamnoside) were up-regulated
after 7 d chilling exposure, and then their contents re-
duced (Fig. 5a). The monosaccharides (fucose, glucose,
and arabinose) had the maximum level at the ecodor-
mancy stage (28 d chilling treated, Fig. 5a), indicating a
well preparatory status for the following re-growth. A
Gas Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (GC-
MS/MS) measurement was then employed to further
analyze the change of sugars during the chilling process
in tree peony, and the results were similar to the meta-
bolomics data. Fructose, glucose, and inositol were the
three most abundant kinds of monosaccharides. The
content of maltose significantly decreased after 7 d chill-
ing treatment. Remarkably, the content of sucrose was
the hightest of all the 13 tested sugars, which signifi-
cantly increased and reached a maximum of 92.9 mg/g
at 14 d chilling, and then declined rapidly (Fig. 5b), sug-
gesting that it might play a vital role in the whole
process. To further investigate the role of sucrose in
dormancy release of buds, the expression patterns of su-
crose synthase (PsSUS1 and PsSUS2) and sucrose invert-
ase
genes
were
analyzed
(Fig.
5c,
Fig.
S4).
The
expression of PsSUS1 continued to decline after 7 d
chilling treatment, but PsSUS2 was up-regulated at 7
and 14 d chilling. The expressions of cytoplasmic invert-
ase (PsCIN), vacuolar invertase (PsVIN), and cell-wall in-
vertase
(PsCWIN)
were
significantly
increased
at
different chilling periods (Fig. 5c). Taken together, it was
presumed that sucrose catabolism was dominant during
chilling duration process, to provide sufficient sugars for
respiratory metabolism and energy metabolism. Starch,
the main storage carbohydrate in higher plants, was
measured during dormancy transition in tree peony. The
results indicated that starch content decreased after
chilling exposure and reached its minimum at 14 d,
which might be related to the activity of amylases
(AMY) during the same process (Fig. 5d).
The changes of flavonoids during dormancy transition
In KEGG enriched terms, the biosynthesis of secondary
metabolites accounted for a large part (Fig. 3b), of which
flavonoids are secondary metabolites that are widely
present in plants. Thus a flavonoids metabolic pathway
analysis was performed to understand its changes during
dormancy transition in buds. Most flavonoids (narin-
genin, apigenin, luteolin, etc.), flavonols (kaempferol,
quercetin, etc.), and anthocyanins (cyanidin 3-O-gluco-
side, pelargonidin 3-O-glucoside, etc.) showed similar
down-regulated tendency at the early stages of dormancy
(0–14 d) and up-regulated at 28 d. Thus, their highest
contents were usually detected at 28 d, such as cyanidin-
base anthocyanins, cyanidin 3-O-glucoside etc. (Fig. 6a).
According to the results of LC-ESI-MS/MS, the relative

contents of anthocyanins were analyzed at 28 d. The re-
sults indicated that five anthocyanins, including cyanidin
3-O-glucoside
(Cy3Glu),
cyanidin
3-O-rutinoside
(CyRut), cyanidin O-syringic acid (CySyr), cyanidin 3,5-
di-O-glucoside (Cy3Glu5Glu), and pelargonidin 3-O-glu-
coside (Pg3Glu), were dominant in flower buds of tree
peony, and the others were relactively rare (Fig. 6a and
b). In detail, cyanidin-base anthocyanins (Cy3Glu5Glu)
accounted for the majority, followed by Cy3Glu (Fig. 6a
and b). Two EBGs (PsCHS and PsF3H) and two LBGs
(PsANS and Ps3GT) showed the similar patterns exclud-
ing PsDFR. Their transcripts were relactively abundant
at the beginning of dormancy (0 d), and dramatically de-
clined at 7 d chilling, but prolonged chilling promoted
their expression compared to 7 d treatment. The PsDFR
remained very low expression level till dormancy release
period, but significally increased by ten folds at 28 d
comparing with 0 d (Fig. 6c, Fig. S4). The expression
patterns of the raltaed genes were accordance with their
content variations during chilling duration process.
The variation of phytohormones during dormancy
transition
Phytohormones play vital roles in plant growth and de-
velopment, flowering, stress response, and so on. In
metabolomics analysis, 14 phytohormones or analogues,
including SA, JA, GA, and ABA, were detected in dor-
mant buds of tree peony, and their content variations
during chilling duration were shown in a heatmap
(Fig. 7a). Nine metabolites presented the highest con-
tents at chilled 0 d (nonchilled period), and the other
five hormones peaked at chilled 28 d (Fig. 7a). They
were divided into three subgroups by cluster analysis
The first subgroup showed a up-regulated tendency with
a peak at 28 d, including SA, GA15, JA, methyl jasmo-
nate (MeJA) and jasmonic acid-isoleucine (JA-Ile). Dihy-
drozeatin, salicylic acid O-glucoside, trans-zeatin N-
glucoside and ABA were categorized into the second
subgroup with an obviously down-regulated tendency.
The others fluctuated during chilling exposure process
with a peak at 0 d chilling point.

The contents of JA, SA, IAA and ABA were also
evaluated by LC-MS/MS analysis, and the results
were similar to the metabolomics data. JA levels
were relatively low from 0 to 21 d chilling, and dra-
matically peaked to 299.167 ng/g with a ten folds in-

Consistent with the variation of JA contents, the
transcript of PsMYC2 increased sharply at chilled 28
d (Fig. 7c, Fig. S4). The contents of SA were down-
regulated from 0 d to 21 d, and then recovered the
initial content of 0 d. The contents of IAA fluctu-
ated during the chilling duration process, reached
the highest level of 44.57 ng/g at 14 d, and its con-
tent of 28 d was also higher than 0 and 21 d (Fig.

that ABA was an inhibitor of dormancy release in
tree peony buds, and chilling treatment could grad-
ually reduce the contents of ABA.
Discussion
The dormancy transition of woody plants is a compli-
cated process, which was synergetically regulated by
photoperiod and low temperature [40]. Chilling treat-
ment as an effective method to promote dormancy re-
lease had been verified in many species including tree
peony [3–5, 9, 41]. Transcriptomics, proteomics and
microRNAs analysis had been performed to investigated
the complex mechanism of chilling induced dormancy

and carbohydrate metabolism [7, 13, 27]. Here, sub-
stance changes were detected by metabolomics analysis
during chilling induced dormancy transition, and the ex-
pression of related genes were also analyzed by qRT-
PCR. Several metabolsim pathways were enriched and
118 metabolites were differential in the process..
Starch degradation and EMP pathway were enhanced
during dormancy release
Carbohydrate is the basic energy substance of primary
metabolism and secondary metabolism. Sugars metabol-
ism and signal transduction involving in bud dormancy
process had been revealed by RNA-seq [42]. Sugar me-
tabolism genes (beta-amylase 5,alpha-amylase-like 1, su-
crose synthase 3, and trehalose-phosphatase/synthase 7),
sugar transporter genes (GT-2 like 1, sucrose-proton sym-
porter 2, protein O-mannosyltransferase 5, and senes-
cence-associated gene 29) and sugar signal transduction
genes (glucose insensitive 2 and beta-fruct 4) had been
proven to involve in dormancy release in poplar, grape
and P. mume [42–44]. In this study, the contents of car-
bohydrates were continuously measured during the chill-
ing induced dormancy transition of tree peony. Both
starch and maltose showed downward trend before dor-
mancy release, which were consistent with the increasing
of amylase activity and sugar catabolism (Fig. 5b, d). At
the same time, the enzyme activity of AMY gradually in-
creased. Our recent results also revealed that the tran-
scripts of PsAMY and PsBMY were up-regulated during
the same process [7, 8, 42]. Together, these results indi-
cated that chilling treatment promoted the degradation
of starch during dormancy release in tree peony. After
endodormancy release (21–28 d), the buds maintained
active respiratory metabolism and amylase activity, but
the contents of starch and maltose did not decrease sig-
nificantly (Fig. 5b, d). It was speculated that a consider-
able amount of carbohydrates were transported from
other parts to the buds, such as the root system (tree

peony has a developed succulent root system), to meet
the consumption of flower buds. In addition, the reopen-
ing of the material transport channel might be another
important
reason,
which
enabled
the
long-distance
transport of carbohydrates [30].
In our study, starch was rapidly degraded at the begin-
ning of the chilling duration due to high amylase activ-
ity, and sucrose was a kind of its intermediate product.
The content of sucrose was the most abundant among
the measured sugars, which implied that sucrose might
also be used to transport of assimilates in tree peony ra-
ther than sorbitol as in apple because sucrose content
was about 3200 folds higher than that of sorbitol. Su-
crose was up-regulated till to 14 d and decreased after-
ward according to GC-MS/MS results (Fig. 5b), although
sucrose synthase gene SUS1 was upregulated by chilling
duration. Our results were different to that in Persian
walnut with a persistent increase of sucrose [8]. Taken
together, we speculated that sucrose mainly came from
starch degradation, and were rapidly utilized for the fol-
lowing EMP pathway and so on. It was also found that
sucrose accumulated, and sucrose synthase genes were
up-regulated at the early stage of dormancy process in
poplar and P. mume [42]. Therefore, sucrose might be
used as an energy center to ensure the supply of glucose
in dormancy transition of tree peony.
In addition, extensive degradation of starch should
lead to glucose accumulation, but glucose and fructose
were at a low level or down-regulated until the ecodor-
mancy stage (Fig. 5a, b). Meanwhile, the contents of F6P
and G6P increased significantly after chilling exposure,
and thereafter decreased (Fig. 4 and 5a). Also, Our previ-
ous study showed that the transcripts (HK and G6P) and
enzyme
activities
of
Hexokinase
and
glucose
6-
phosphate isomerase were also significantly up-regulated
[7, 42]. These results indicated that the EMP pathway
was activated after chilling exposure in tree peony.
Metabolomics results showed that dormancy release was
an energy-consuming process. A large number of carbo-
hydrates were broken down to produce enough sub-
stances and energy to promote dormancy release, which
also providied a carbon chain for secondary metabolism.
Flavonoids accumulation at ecodormancy stage
As secondary metabolites, flavonoids play important
roles in many processes of plant growth and develop-
ment, such as color formation, stress resistance, etc.
[15]. However, the changes and functions of flavonoids
during dormancy transition were still poorly understood.
Variations of flavonoids were analyzed during chilling
duration process in our work. Flavonoids (e.g. quercetin,
kaempferol, and apigenin) were synthesized in the early
step of the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway, which were
down-regulated in the whole endodormancy stage and
sharply upregulated at 28 d, corresponding to the de-
creasing expression of PsCHI (Fig. 6). The flavonoids ac-
cumulation at early stage of chilling treatment (0 d and
7 d) might be related to cold tolerance for winter sur-
vival. It was considered that the initial products of the
flavonoids
biosynthesis
pathway,
such
as
quercetin,
kaempferol, apigenin, etc., inhibited the transport of
polar auxin to regulate plant development [45]. Also, the
correlation between pollen fertility and flavonoids have
been found in maize and peanuts [23], and the silencing
of chalcone synthase gene resultes in parthenocarpy in
tomato [46]. Flavonols (in particular quercetin) is essen-
tial for pollen germination in tobacco [26]. In our re-
sults, flavonols showed higher levels at ecodormancy
stage
(Fig. 6a), when
the flower
buds were well-
differentiated, and stamens were clearly visible [34].
Therefore, it was speculated that flavonols might be in-
volved in flower bud development at ecodormancy stage
in tree peony.
In a recent study, Gu et al. (2019) suggested that
anthocyanin accumulation occurred 10 d before anthesis
in tree peony ‘Qing Hai Hu Yin Bo’ [47]. Here, we found
anthocyanins were up-regulated after endodormancy re-
lease, accumulating in large amounts at ecodormancy
stage in tree peony ‘Luhehong’ (Fig. 6). The results im-
plied that the floral pigments might begin their synthesis
and accumulation before the bud entering into endodor-
mancy with a peak at ecodormancy period. Cyanidin-
based glycosides such as Cy3Glu and Cy3Glu5Glu were
the most abundant anthocyanins in the petal blotches of
35 cultivars [48], and they were also the most abundant
anthocyanins in the buds of ‘Luhehong’ (Fig. 6b). We hy-
pothesized that chilling-induced dormancy release syn-
chronously
activated
anthocyanin
synthesis
and
accumulation.
Taken together, flavonoids synthesis and accumulation
could be actived by prolonged chilling, and dormancy
release
might
accelerate
flower
bud
development
through flavonoids accumulation. To our knowledge, it
was the first report to describe the changes and role of
flavonoids
during dormancy
transition
in
perennial
woody plants.
The roles of phytohormone during dormancy transition
In perennial woody plants, ABA and GA have been
widely proven to regulate bud dormancy. Recent re-
searches revealed the antagnism between ABA and GA
in bud dormancy. The GA and ABA pathways are found
to be the most enriched in the comparison of different
dormancy stages in grape [49]. A MADS-box (DAM)
family gene, SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE-like (SVL)
have been found to play a key role in ABA-mediated
bud dormancy in poplar. In SVL RNAi strain, the ex-
pression of FT1 is significantly up-regulated, and GA

biosynthesis key enzyme gene GA20ox is up-regulated to
promote bud rupture [32]. Further research found that
SVL could directly bind to the promoters of GA2ox8
and CALS1 to induce their expression, reduce the levels
of active GAs and control the closure of plasmodesmata,
thereby maintain dormancy status [50]. Chilling accu-
mulation reduces the level of ABA, which in turn sup-
presses
the
expression
of
SVL
and
promotes
the
biosynthesis of GAs, and finally break bud dormancy
[36]. In our work, ABA was persistently down-regulated
along with the chilling duration (Fig. 7), which was simi-
lar to grape during domancy transition process [51].
Gibberellin 15, the precursor of bioactive gibberellins,
was up-regulated gradually (Fig. 7a). Meanwhile, the ex-
pression of PsGA20ox was up-regulated, and the content
of GAs increased with chilling accumulation in tree
peony [51, 52]. Therefore, there might be similar mecha-
nisms between ABA and GA-regulated dormancy in
poplar and tree peony.
Auxins and cytokinins (CKs) play antagonistic roles in
meristems of many plants [53]. Previous researches had
shown that CKs play a positive role in hydrogen
cyanamide-induced bud dormancy release in grape [54],
but that of IAA is still ambiguous until now. In our
study, the level of CKs (dihydrozeatin, trans-zeatin N-
glucoside and kinetin 9-rboside) decreased after chilling
exposure, and IAA was up-regulated by chilling through
metabolomics and LC-MS/MS analysis (Fig. 7). TRAN
SPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE1/AUXIN SIGNALING
F-BOX PROTEIN (TIR1/AFB) family are known as
auxin receptors [55]. The transcripts of PsTIR1 were sig-
nificantly induced and consistent with the IAA contents
variation (Fig. 7c), which implied a positive role of IAA
during dormancy release in tree peony. These results
were different from the upregulation of CKs in P. kingia-
num and P. mume during the same process [56, 57].
Therefore, the regulations of CKs and IAA in dormancy
release were not a common mechanism in different per-
ennial plants, and they might not be the key factors in
dormancy regulation.
Usually, SA and JA are regarded as stress response
hormones, rather than function on dormancy regulation
[58, 59]. Recently, Ionescu et al. (2017) proposed that
the upregulation of JA-Ile induced the expression of
MYB21 (myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog B21) and
MYB108
to
participate
in
the
flower
development
process during HC-induced dormancy release in sweet
cherry [57]. In our results, JAs were dramatically upregu-
lated when entering ecodormancy period, along with a
transcriptional increase of PsMYC2, a key transcription
factor for JA signal transduction (Fig. 7). The results in-
dicated that JA signal transduction was activated after
the fufilment of chilling accumulation. In a recent study,
the mechanism of JA promoting the anthocyanins
accumulation was revealed in Arabidopsis. When the JA
content increases, the inhibitory effect of JAZs (jasmo-
nate ZIM-domain) protein on MYB-bHLH-WD40 com-
plex is released, which will promote the expression of
DFR and ANS, and the accumulation of anthocyanins
[60]. Interestingly, PsDFR and PsANS also significantly
increased, and anthocyanins presented higher levels at
28 d chilling treatment in our study (Fig. 7). It was hy-
pothesized that JA additionally involved in anthocyanin
accumulation after endodormancy release in tree peony.
Additionally, SA involves in the response to low-
temperature stress, for SA and glucosyl SA accumulating
after low-temperature exposure [58]. The use of exogen-
ous SA improves the cold tolerance of corn, cucumber,
and rice [59]. The accumulations of SA and Salicylic acid
O-glucoside were also observed during chilling induced
dormancy release in tree peony (Fig. 7), it might be the
response of buds to low-temperature stress.
Conclusions
In summary, we systematically revealed the metabolomic
changes during the chilling induced dormancy transition
of tree peony, and a total of 511 substances and 118
DMs were identified. Chilling accumulation promoted
the degradation of starch and enhanced the activity of
EMP, providing adequate energy and substances for sec-
ondary metabolism required by dormancy release and
bud burst. Flavonoid was accumulated by sufficient chill-
ing duration along with endodormancy release. Further-
more, we also reported phytohormone changes during
the dormancy transition in tree peony. Prolonged chill-
ing exposure declined ABA content, but promoted JA
and GA accumulation at the end of dormancy. Taken
together, we proposed a work model of dormancy transi-
tion induced by chilling according to the metabonomics
analysis (Fig. 8). Our results might help to better under-
stand the dormancy transition of perennial plants.
Materials and methods
Plant materials
Four-years-old tree peony plants (Paeonia suffruticosa
cv. Luhehong) were provided by Tree Peony Research
Institute of Qingdao Agricultural University, Qingdao,
China. The plants were treated with continuous artificial
chilling (0–4 °C refrigeratory storage, dark/24 h) from
Nov 12, 2018 with the daily average temperature less
than 10 °C as described previously [7]. At 0, 7, 14, 21
and 28 d after refrigerating treatment, buds were picked
and scales were removed in each time point, frozen in li-
quid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until further ana-
lysis. The samples from each three plants were harvested
and mixed in each treatment. Three replicates (3 plants/
replicate) per group were set.

Sample preparation and extraction
After freeze-drying, the samples were crushed at 30 Hz
for 1.5 min using a mixing mill with zirconia beads (MM
400, Retsch). Then powder (100 mg) was mixed with
70% methanol solution (1 mL, containing 0.1 mg/L lido-
caine as an internal standard) at 4 °C overnight. After
centrifugation (10,000 g, 10 min), the supernatant was
filtered (scaa-104, aperture 0.22 μm; ANPEL, Shanghai,
China) and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Quality control
(QC) samples were mixed with all samples to test the re-
peatability of the whole experiment [61].
Liquid chromatography electrospray ionisation tandem
mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS)
The extracted compounds were analyzed using an LC-
ESI-MS/MS system (UPLC, Shim-pack UFLC SHIM
ADZU CBM20A; MS/MS, Applied Biosystems 4500
QTRAP) by Gene Denovo Biotechnology Co. Ltd.,
Guangzhou, China [62]. Firstly, the samples (5 μL) were
added into a Waters ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 C18
chromatographic column (2.1 mm × 100 mm, 1.8 m) with
a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min at 40 °C. The water and aceto-
nitrile were acidificated with 0.04% acetic acid, which
were used as the mobile phases of stages A and B,
respectively. The phase gradients to separate the com-
pounds was as Chen et al. [62]. The Linear ion trap
(LIT) and triple quadrupole (QQQ) scans were per-
formed on the triple quadrupole linear ion TRAP mass
spectrometer (QTRAP). Then AB Sciex QTRAP4500
(ABQ) system was equipped with an ESI-Turbo Ion-
Spray interface. ABQ was ran in positive ion mode, and
Analyst 1.6.1 software (AB Sciex) was used to operate
according to Chen et al. [62].
Qualitative and quantitative determination of metabolites
The qualitative analysis of metabolites was performed
based on the public metabolite database (e.g. MassBank
and KNApSAcK) and the METLIN database (MWDB)
[37, 38]. The repetitive signal (e.g. K+, Na+, NH4
+, and
other large molecular weight species) were removed dur-
ing the analysis process. The metabolites were quantified
by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) of triple quad-
rupole mass spectrometry. The total ion chromatogram
(TIC) and extracted ion chromatogram (EIC or Xic) of
QC samples were derived to summarize the metabolite
spectra of all samples and calculate the area of each
peak. The MultiaQuant software (v 3.0.3) was used to in-
tegrate and calibrate the peaks.

Principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal
projection to latent structures-discriminant analysis
(OPLS-DA)
To initially visualize the differences between the groups, the
R package “ropls” was employed for principal component
analysis (PCA) (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/
bioc/html/ropls.html).
Orthogonal
projection
to
latent
structures-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) is an develop-
ment of PLS-DA, which comprises an Orthogonal Signal
Correction (OSC) filter into a PLS model. The OPLS-DA
model was used to analyze all comparison groups. And,
subsequent model tests and differential metabolite screen-
ing were analyzed using OPLS-DA results.
Differential metabolites analysis and KEGG analysis
The most distinguishable metabolites between every two
groups were ranked by the variable importance of the
projection (VIP) score according to OPLS model. The
threshold for VIP was set to 1.0. Besides, Student’s t test
was used as to screen differential metabolites. Those
with P < 0.05 and VIP ≥1 were considered as differential
metabolites between two groups. The KEGG Orthology
software
(http://kobas.cbi.pku.edu.cn/)
was
used
for
KEGG pathway analysis.
RNA extraction and real time quantitative PCR analysis
After 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 d 0–4 °C treatment, the total
RNA was isolated from P. suffruticosa flower buds ac-
cording to the protocol of RNA isolation kit (TaKaRa,
Dalian, China). The DNase I (TaKaRa, Dalian, China)
was used to remove genomic DNA. The first strand
cDNA was synthesized by HiScript III RT SuperMix for
qPCR (+gDNA wiper) (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). qRT-
PCR was carried out using ChamQ Universal SYBR
qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme, Nanjing, China) following
the manufacturer’s protocol. The detailed reaction sys-
tem and procedure were similar to the previous study
[36]. Additionally, the P. suffruticosa Actin was used as
an internal control to normalize the transcriptional
levels based on our previous results of different candi-
date control genes (Actin, beta-tubulin, alpha-tubulin
and 60S-L11) [63]. The Primer Premier 6 was used to de-
signed specific primers (Table S4), and the candidate
genes were selected based on our previous transcrip-
tional profile [36], with their phylogenetic trees pre-
sented in Fig. S4. The relative expression levels were
calculated using 2−ΔΔCt method [64].
Measurements of sugar contents
Three flower buds of every repeat at five chilling points
were crushed by a crusher (MM 400, Retsch) containing
zirconia beads at 30 Hz. A total of 20 mg powder was
added into 500 μL of methanol: isopropanol: water (3: 3:
2, V/V/V) solution. The supernatant (50 μL) were taken
and evaporated in nitrogen after being vortexed (3 min)
and sonicated (30 min), with adding internal standard.
After evaporated in a nitrogen stream and freeze-drying,
the residue was further derivated as follows: Firstly, the
small molecule carbohydrate was mixed with methoxine
hydrochloride solution (100 μL) in the 1.5 mL tubes. Sec-
ondly, bistrifluoroacetamide (100 μL) was added to the
solution at 37 °C for 2 h. After vortexed, the mixture was
incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. N-Hexane was used as di-
lution fusion. Then, mixture was detected by MetWare
(http://www.metware.cn/) based on the Agilent7890B-
7000D GC-MS/MS platform, and the parameters were
set as reported by Gómez-González et al. [65] .
Measurements of starch content and AMY enzyme
activity
The contents of starch at five chilling points was deter-
mined according to the previous method with little
change, respectively [66]. The crushed tree peony buds
(0.1 g) were extracted in 7.2 mL of ethanol (80%) at
80 °C for 30 min. The extract was centrifuged for 30 min,
and the precipitate was gelatinized in a boiling water
bath for 15 min. Concentrated sulfuric acid was added to
the precipitate to dehydrate monosaccharides into alde-
hyde compounds. The anthrone reagent was used to
react with the test solution. The absorbance at 640 nm
was recorded with a spectrophotometer (HITACHI,
Japan).
The AMY enzyme activity was determined according
to the method of Huggins and Russell (1948) with minor
modifications [67]. About 0.2 g flower buds after differ-
ent chilling fulfilling (0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 d) from tree
peony was ground into a homogenate, and centrifuged
to collect the supernatant, respectively. The supernatant
was incubated at 70 °C for 30 min to inactivate β-
amylase. The samples were reacted with 3,5-dinitrosa-
licylic acid. The absorbance at 525 nm was recorded with
a spectrophotometer (HITACHI, Japan).
Measurements of hormone contents
Approximately 2 g fresh weight buds per repeat were
taken from different chilling treatments. The contents of
phytohormones were determined by the Wuhan Green-
sword

(One way ANOVA) was used to compare statistical dif-
ferences and levels of gene expression between treat-
ments and control.
