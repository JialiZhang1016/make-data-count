Abstract 
Background:  The 18-gene tumor inflammation signature (TIS) is a clinical research assay that enriches for clinical 
benefit to immune checkpoint blockade. We evaluated its ability to predict clinical benefit of immunotherapy in can‑
cer patients treated with PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors in routine clinical care.
Methods:  The CERTIM cohort is a prospective cohort which includes patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibi‑
tors in Cochin University hospital. RNA extracted from 58 archival formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor blocks 
(including 38 lung cancers, 5 melanomas, 10 renal carcinomas, 4 urothelial carcinomas and 1 colon carcinoma) was 
hybridized to a beta version of the ­NanoString® PanCancer IO360™ CodeSet using ­nCounter® technology. Gene 
expression signatures were correlated with tumor responses (by RECIST criteria) and overall survival. PD-L1 immu‑
nostaining on tumor cells was assessed in 37 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples and tumor mutational 
burden (TMB) measured by whole exome sequencing in 19 of these.
Results:  TIS scores were significantly associated with complete or partial response to anti-PD-1 treatment in the 
whole cohort (odds ratio = 2.64, 95% CI [1.4; 6.0], p = 0.008), as well as in the NSCLC population (odds ratio = 3.27, 95% 
CI [1.2; 11.6], p = 0.03). Patients whose tumor had a high TIS score (upper tertile) showed prolonged overall survival 
compared to patients whose tumor had lower TIS scores, both in the whole cohort (hazard ratio = 0.37, 95% CI [0.18, 
0.76], p = 0.005) and in the NSCLC population (hazard ratio = 0.36, 95% CI [0.14, 0.90], p = 0.02). In the latter, the TIS 
score was independent from either PD-L1 staining on tumor cells (spearman coefficient 0.2) and TMB (spearman coef‑
ficient − 0.2).
Conclusions:  These results indicate that validated gene expression assay measuring the level of tumor microenviron‑
ment inflammation such as TIS, are accurate and independent predictive biomarkers and can be easily implemented 
in the clinical practice.

Background
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), specifically block-
ade of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway via monoclonal anti-
bodies, have entered the oncology therapeutic arsenal 
and are being evaluated in an increasing number of 
indications, although the response rates as single agents 
and in unselected patient populations are usually low. 
A variety of biomarkers are currently being explored as 
strategies to enrich for clinical responders, and for some 
indications, approvals of the anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapeu-
tic incorporate biomarker testing in the form of PD-L1 
measurement by immunohistochemistry (IHC) into the 
prescribing label. Despite being cleared by the FDA as 
companion and/or complementary diagnostics for dif-
ferent anti-PD-1/PD-L1 drugs, PD-L1 IHC assays have 
a number of limitations, including suboptimal positive 
and negative predictive value and reproducibility. As ICI 
disrupt pathways that are conserved between tumor cells 
from multiple different tumor types and the immune 
environment, biomarkers which are predictive across a 
variety of indications are of particular interest.
Several biomarkers have been developed which char-
acterize either the potential for tumor cells to prime an 
adaptive immune response, e.g. tumor mutation burden 
(TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI), or the down-
stream consequences of immune activation, as measured 
by presence of immune cells e.g. Immunoscore, or gene 
expression signature related to immune environment [1]. 
A number of candidate gene expression signatures have 
been developed, and most focus on biology of activated 
T cells and IFNγ signaling [2, 3] Interestingly, defects 
in the IFNγ signaling pathway have been identified as a 
mechanism of resistance, strongly supporting a crucial 
role of IFNγ in the anti-cancer immune response [4, 5]. 
An association between IFNγ expression or IFNγ induc-
ible gene signature and clinical responses to anti-PD-1/
PD-L1 mAb was reported in melanoma [6] and blad-
der carcinomas [7]. Recently an 18 gene “tumor inflam-
mation signature” (TIS) which quantifies an activated 
but suppressed adaptive immune response in the tumor 
microenvironment, was demonstrated to retrospectively 
predict clinical benefit of anti-PD-1 in various cancer 
types (melanoma, head and neck squamous cell carcino-
mas, digestive cancers, ovarian and triple negative breast 
cancers) in clinical trials [2]. The signature has been 
analytically validated [8, 9] and is currently under inves-
tigation in multiple Research Use Only (RUO) and Inves-
tigational Use Only (IUO) studies for performance as a 
predictive biomarker.
In order to assess the feasibility and utility of gene 
expression profiling in routine clinical practice, we 
assessed the TIS score from a mixed tumor cohort of 
patients treated with anti-PD-1 on label at a single center 
as part of a larger transcriptional profiling study with the 
PanCancer IO360 gene expression panel.
Methods
Patients
Fifty-eight patients from the CERTIM (Immunomodu-
latory Therapies Multidisciplinary Study group) were 
included in the study. The CERTIM cohort was initiated 
in our hospital in July 2015 and prospectively includes 
all the patients treated with a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor 
(either nivolumab or pembrolizumab) administered per 
label as a single agent, for advanced solid tumor. Treat-
ment was continued until disease progression or intol-
erable toxicity, physician or patient decision. Tumor 
imaging by CT scan was performed at baseline, every 
8  weeks for patients receiving nivolumab and every 
6  weeks for patients receiving pembrolizumab through 
the first 6 months and every 12 weeks for both thereafter. 
Response was assessed per Response Evaluation Criteria 
in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Clinically stable 
patients considered to be deriving clinical benefit could 
continue therapy until disease progression was confirmed 
on imaging done at least 4 weeks after the first assess-
ment of stable disease. The toxicities observed in the 
patient cohort were monthly reviewed by the dedicated 
CERTIM multidisciplinary board. Clinical status was 
assessed monthly during treatment and continued when 
the treatment was stopped. Database lock-up was 9 Feb-
ruary 2018. Median patients follow-up was 19.2 months.
This study was approved by the ethics committee (CPP 
Ile de France II, no. 2008-133, 2012 06-12, 2018 MS1) in 
agreement with article L.1121-1 of French law.
PD‑L1 immunostaining
For each tumor, we performed PD-L1 immunostaining 
on fresh-cut slides from representative FFPE blocks using 
an anti-PD-L1 antibody (E1L3N, Cell signaling) on Bond 
automat (Leica) as previously described and validated 
by the PATTERN French thoracic pathologists group 
[10]. Staining was blinded analyzed (DD, ALM, BB) on 
tumoral cells.
Genomic DNA extraction and illumina‑based whole‑exome 
sequencing
Genomic DNA from 22 tumors was isolated from forma-
lin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks using Maxwell 
16 FFPE Tissue LEV DNA Purification Kit (Promega), 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Whole-
exome was sequenced as previously reported [11]. DNA 
were sequenced on the Novaseq 6000 platform, using 
at least 100 ng of double stranded tumoral DNA (Qubit 
dsDNA HS kit). After shearing, 11 randomly selected 
samples were run on the Agilent Bioanalyzer to confirm 
Page 3 of 10
Damotte et al. J Transl Med          (2019) 17:357 
successful shearing prior to library construction The 
SureSelect Human All Exon V6 capture kit was used to 
capture coding regions of genes included in the major 
genomic databases. Paired end FASTQ files of 101mer 
sequence reads were generated. All sequence data was 
quality controlled for read counts, quality values, kmer 
usage, GC-content, and all other relevant parameters with 
FastQC (v0.10.1). The DNA read sequences were aligned 
to the genome (UCSC hg19; Feb 2009 release) using BWA 
(v0.7.15) and reads sorting and PCR duplicate removal 
were conducted using Picard (v2.8.3). VarScan2 (v2.4.2) 
with Samtools mpileup (v1.3) was used to call SNVs/Indels 
against human reference genome. Germline polymor-
phisms were removed by retaining only variants with MAF 
in all races of < 1% or unknown MAF within the 1000 
genomes and NHLBI-ESP project with 6500 exome data-
base. The retained SNVs/indels were further filtered by 
removing SNPs in dbSNP129. Depth of sequencing cover-
age was 60× on average across all samples in the cohort.
RNA extraction and hybridization to nCounter codeset
Archival biopsies of patients included in the CERTIM 
cohort, sampled before anti-PD-1 treatment and with 
adequate tumor tissue left in FFPE blocks were selected 
for RNA extraction. RNA was extracted with High Pure 
FFPE RNA Isolation Kit (Roche) from FFPE tumor sam-
ples according to the recommendations of the manufac-
turer and quantified using fluorimetry with Qubit™ RNA 
XR Assay Kit (Invitrogen). 100 ng RNA (46 samples) or 30 
to 85 ng RNA (12 samples) were successfully hybridized 
to a beta version of the ­NanoString® PanCancer IO 360 
Panel code set, according to the recommendations of the 
manufacturer.
Statistical analysis of transcriptional data
Raw data for each sample and gene were normalized 
to internal ERCC controls to eliminate technical vari-
ability of the assay, and then counts were normalized 
to the geometric mean of endogenous housekeeping 
genes followed by log2 transformation. Gene expres-
sion signatures, including the TIS, were calculated as 
a weighted linear average of the constituent genes [2, 
12]. The weighted scores used for calculation of the TIS 
and other signatures are NanoString intellectual prop-
erty. For the correlation analysis with clinical response 
to treatment, clinical benefit was defined as complete or 
partial RECIST response while stable and progressive 
disease were defined as lack of clinical benefit. Normal-
ized gene counts and signature scores were compared to 
the response category using a linear model. The log2 fold 
change, Wald-type confidence interval and p-value were 
calculated for each gene and signature (Additional file 1: 
Table S1 and Additional file 2: Table S2). To assess pre-
dictive performance of the additional signatures above 
and beyond the predictive performance of TIS, a logistic 
regression model was used to assess performance condi-
tional upon TIS score.
For the analysis on the survival time, the genes and 
scores were dichotomized into high and low groups 
based on median, with the exception of TIS which was 
divided into tertiles. The survival time was fit to the 
binary group with Cox proportional hazard model. The 
hazard ratio between the high and low group, the Wald-
type confidence interval and the log-rank test p-value are 
reported for each gene and signature (Additional file 1: 
Table S1 and Additional file 2: Table S2).
Results
Tumor inflammation signature enriches for clinical 
response to anti‑PD‑1 in the multi‑tumor cohort
Consecutive metastatic cancer patients treated with anti-
PD-1 monoclonal antibodies in the outpatient monocen-
tric CERTIM cohort with available FFPE tumor specimen 
were selected for analysis of gene expression and immune 
signatures using NanoString PanCancer IO 360 Panel 
(beta version), which contains an RUO version of the 
TIS. The clinical characteristics of the 58 patients with 
different cancer types included in this study are described 
in Table  1. Several genes showed a differential expres-
sion in responders to anti-PD-1 [patients with complete 
response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to 
RECIST criteria] compared to non-responders (stable or 
progressive disease) (Additional file  1: Table  S1). After 
correction for multiple testing, 5 genes related to IFNγ 
signaling and antigen processing remained significantly 
higher in responders: CXCL9, CXL10, CXCL11, TAP1 
and PSMB9 (Fig. 1a). Since a number of the genes with 
greatest association with clinical benefit are contained 
within or closely related to genes in the TIS, we evalu-
ated the TIS as a predictive biomarker in this cohort. In 
this study, a high TIS score was significantly associated 
with response to anti-PD-1 treatment (odds ratio = 2.64, 
95% CI [1.4; 6.0], p = 0.008, Logistic regression) (Fig. 1b). 
Furthermore, patients with a high TIS score (upper 
tertile) had a prolonged overall survival compared to 
patients with lower scores (hazard ratio = 0.37, 95% CI 
[0.18, 0.76], p-value = 0.005, Cox regression) (Fig.  1c). 
The expression of 16 genes included in the TIS score 
were closely correlated, whereas CD276 and HLA-DQA1 
expression appeared more variable across TIS scores 
(Fig.  1d). The normalized gene expression data, TIS 
score, as well as response to ICI and survival for each of 
the samples included in this study are provided in Addi-
tional file 3: Table S3. Altogether, these data indicate that 
Page 4 of 10
Damotte et al. J Transl Med          (2019) 17:357 
the TIS is significantly associated with clinical benefit of 
anti-PD-1 (pembrolizumab or nivolumab) in a « real life » 
cohort of patients.
TIS predictive of anti‑PD‑1 benefit in non small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) cohort
We then focused our analysis on NSCLC which rep-
resented the majority of the cases that were studied in 
this cohort. All 37 patients had received nivolumab, 
and the clinical characteristics of the patients, includ-
ing the tumor subtype and smoking status, are indi-
cated in Table 2. Overall, 7/37 (19%) patients responded 
to treatment. As in the whole cohort, we observed that 
TIS enriched for tumor response in NSCLC (odds 
ratio = 3.27, 95% CI [1.2; 11.6], p = 0.03, Logistic regres-
sion) (Fig.  2a). Furthermore, patients with a high TIS 
score (upper tertile) had a prolonged survival compared 
to those with lower TIS scores (hazard ratio = 0.36, 95% 
CI [0.14, 0.90], p-value = 0.02, Cox regression) (Fig. 2b). 
In order to assess the predictive value of TIS score within 
the context of one of other biomarkers of clinical interest, 
we also scored the NSCLC samples for PD-L1 expression 
by IHC at the 1% and 50% cutoff for tumor cell positiv-
ity, the two cut offs reported in the label for second and 
first line NSCLC patient selection for treatment with 
pembrolizumab. PD-L1 staining ≥ 1% tumor cells was not 
significantly associated with survival (hazard ratio = 0.87, 
CI [0.4, 2], p = 0.74), and PD-L1 staining on 50% tumor 
cells had a trend with overall survival but did not reach 
statistical significance (hazard ratio = 0.40, CI [0.1, 1.3], 
p = 0.13) (Fig. 2c, d). Additionally, tumor mutational bur-
den by whole exome sequencing was available for 19 of 
the patients (see Additional file 4: Table S4 for baseline 
characteristics). The tumor mutational burden ranged 
from 13.7 to 26.8 mutations/MB and was positively cor-
related with the number of smoking pack years (spear-
man coefficient 0.43). In this limited patient cohort, TMB 
was lower in adenocarcinoma (n = 11, median = 20.3 
mutation/Mb) than in squamous cell carcinoma (n = 6, 
median = 23.3 mutation/Mb) (p value = 0.01, Fisher test), 
and was not significantly associated with survival (hazard 
ratio = 1.91, CI [0.6, 6.2], p = 0.25). In this small cohort, 
TIS was still significantly associated with overall survival

(p = 0.02, data not shown). Finally, we assessed whether 
any of the biomarkers were associated with one another, 
and observed that PD-L1 staining on tumor cells and 
TMB were positively correlated with tobacco exposure, 
but the other biomarkers were not strongly associated 
with each other (Fig. 2e). Specifically, PD-L1 IHC stain-
ing was not significantly with TMB (spearman coefficient 
− 0.16, p value 0.53), and the TIS was not significantly 
correlated with either PD-L1 immunohistochemical 
staining (spearman coefficient 0.20, p value 0.25), or 
TMB (spearman coefficient − 0.22, p value 0.38).
Additional signatures beyond TIS predictive of anti‑PD‑1 
benefit
We next evaluated a number of other predefined immune 
gene signatures contained within the IO360 panel for 
their association with response in the NSCLC cohort 
and identified several signatures that were statisti-
cally significant, including IFNγ signaling, lymphoid 
cells, T cell, NK cells, cytotoxic cells, exhausted CD8 T 
cells, macrophages, stroma, inflammatory chemokines, 
and immunoproteasome (Fig.  3a). The majority had 
strong positive correlation with TIS and with each other 
(Fig. 3b). Multivariate analysis showed that none of these 
gene signatures significantly predicted for response after 
correcting for TIS (data not shown). The signatures were 
then evaluated to see which were also predictive of over-
all survival in the NSCLC cohort, and only TIS, stroma, 
and lymphoid signatures were significantly associated 
(Additional file 5: Figure S1). In the multi-tumor cohort, 
several signatures were associated with response, but 
only IFNγ signature remained significant after adjusting 
for TIS (p-value = 0.03) (Additional file  6: Figure S2A); 
whereas TIS, immunoproteasome, lymphoid and hypoxia 
signatures were predictive of survival (Additional file 6: 
Figure S2B). These findings indicate that TIS is a robust 
biomarker of both response and survival following PD-1 
checkpoint blockade in both NSCLC and multi-tumor 
cohorts from real world patients.
Discussion
The limited efficacy, potential toxicity and the cost of 
anti-PD-1/PD-L1 molecules in cancers patients calls 
for the use of predictive biomarkers. Our study focused 
on gene expression based biomarkers because they are

cohort. All patients were treated with nivolumab. The response was fit to TIS scores with logistic regression and p-value = 0.033, indicating that high 
TIS scores are predictive of tumor response to anti PD-1 treatment. The odds ratio is 3.27, 95% confidence interval (1.23, 11.63). b The Kaplan–Meier 
curves of TIS score groups for the NSCLC cohort. Patients are stratified by TIS score tertiles, and the highest TIS score group was observed to have 
longer survival than the other two groups (which are combined into the “low” group on the graph). The survival time is fit to TIS score group (high 
vs low and intermediate) with Cox proportional hazard model. Hazard ratio is 0.36, 95% confidence interval (0.14, 0.90), p-value = 0.0235, meaning 
the high TIS score group has a decrease of the hazard by 64%. c The Kaplan–Meier curves of NSCLC patients with 1% PD-L1 positivity on tumor 
cells used as a cutoff. The survival time in the NSCLC cohort is fit to PD-L1+ group (high vs low) with Cox proportional hazard model. d The Kaplan–
Meier curves of NSCLC patients with 50% PD-L1 positivity on tumor cells used as a cutoff. The survival time in the NSCLC cohort is fit to PD-L1+ 
group (high vs low) with Cox proportional hazard model. Analysis suggests that patients with 50% PD-L1+ tumor cells may have longer survival, 
but the sample size is too limited to reach statistical significance. e The Spearman correlation matrix between TIS scores, percentage of PD-L1+

compatible with current clinical practice, i.e. they can 
be performed with small tissue samples and using a local 
laboratory and have the potential for clinical utility across 
disease indications and therapeutic agents. The TIS was 
originally described as a biomarker predictive of response 
in patients with different cancer types, treated with pem-
brolizumab in the context of clinical trials [2]. Here, we 
extend the characterization of TIS to include novel indi-
cations (NSCLC) and novel agents (nivolumab). One 
strength of this study is that it was performed on patients 
treated in the community setting; thus in a less selected 
patient population than in clinical trials and likely more 
reflective of larger real world performance. This study 
demonstrates an association of high TIS with ICI benefit, 
for both clinical response and overall survival, indepen-
dently of carcinoma subtype and anti-PD-1 therapeutic 
molecule administered.
The study has a number of limitations which must be 
considered in the interpretation of results. First, the study 
is composed of a small cohort of patients, especially the 
lung cancer cohort. Despite the small cohort size, the TIS 
was predictive of both response and survival, and thus 
may represent a realistic option for the identification of 
patients who may benefit from ICI. We await the avail-
ability of larger cohorts of patients treated with ICI in the 
real life management to confirm these results. Ultimately, 
prospective clinical trials using TIS as a stratifying bio-
marker are needed to definitely confirm its predictive 
value in different cancer types.
It is worth considering the performance of the non-
gene signature biomarkers in this study. Although it is the 
approved diagnostic, PD-L1 IHC was not observed to be 
predictive, which may be due to tissue heterogeneity and 
the cohort size. Small biopsies sometimes comprise small 
numbers of tumor cells and the positivity of these cells 
may not reflect the whole tumor status [13]. Using mul-
tigene signatures such as the TIS may be a more robust 
way of measuring the presence of a cytotoxic anti-tumor 
immune response than measuring PD-L1 protein alone. 
Similarly, high TMB has been shown to be associated 
with ICI benefit, particularly in lung cancer, in numerous 
studies [14–17], but it was not predictive in this cohort of 
NSCLC, nor was it correlated with TIS. This may be due 
to the limited number of cases studied, mixed histology 
(adenocarcinoma and SCC) and/or the fact that TMB 
was high in all samples (13.7 to 26.8 mutations/MB). 
Interestingly, a recent study established that TMB and 
TIS were independently predictive of clinical response to 
pembrolizumab in KEYNOTE clinical trials in a variety 
of tumors but without examining NSCLC [18]. Further 
limiting its utility, at the current time TMB measurement 
is a costly technique, and is awaiting for international 
standardization and recommendations [19].
Finally, gene signatures beyond TIS may be required 
in the future to further dissect mechanisms of immune 
resistance in patients whose tumor does not respond to 
single agent PD-1/PD-L1 blockade to inform biology-
based combinations. Specifically, while tumor inflamma-
tion gene signatures, including TIS, are measuring IFN 
biology and/or presence of specific T cell populations [2, 
6, 20–22], additional signatures (which could be com-
bined with TIS) are needed to gain further insight into

additional processes associated with immune escape that 
could be targeted therapeutically [23].
Conclusions
In this study, gene expression signatures were analyzed 
in a cohort of FFPE tumor samples from cancer patients 
treated with anti-PD-1 in routine clinical care. The tumor 
inflammation signature was significantly associated with 
clinical response and overall survival, supporting its eval-
uation in parallel with other biomarkers in routine prac-
tice and future clinical trials.
