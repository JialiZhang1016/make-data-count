cetacean

Understanding the genetic structure of a population is essential to its conservation and management. We report the level of
genetic diversity and determine the population structure of a cryptic deep ocean cetacean, the Gray’s beaked whale (Mesoplodon
grayi). We analysed 530 bp of mitochondrial control region and 12 microsatellite loci from 94 individuals stranded around New
Zealand and Australia. The samples cover a large area of the species distribution (~ 6000 km) and were collected over a 22-year
period. We show high genetic diversity (h = 0.933–0.987, π = 0.763–0.996% and Rs = 4.22–4.37, He = 0.624–0.675), and, in
contrast to other cetaceans, we found a complete lack of genetic structure in both maternally and biparentally inherited markers.
The oceanic habitats around New Zealand are diverse with extremely deep waters, seamounts and submarine canyons that are
suitable for Gray’s beaked whales and their prey. We propose that the abundance of this rich habitat has promoted genetic
homogeneity in this species. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the lack of beaked whale sightings is the result of their
low abundance, but this is in contrast to our estimates of female effective population size based on mitochondrial data.
In conclusion, the high diversity and lack of genetic structure can be explained by a historically large population size,
in combination with no known exploitation, few apparent behavioural barriers and abundant habitat.

INTRODUCTION
Population history, demography and behaviour all interact to shape the
genetic diversity of a species. Species with fragmented or reduced
populations often have low levels of genetic diversity. In contrast, high
genetic diversity is consistent with long-term stability in population
size, whereas low levels of population differentiation suggest connec-
tivity or recent population expansion. As a rule, cetaceans are known to
have low genetic diversity in comparison with terrestrial mammals and
this is hypothesized to be due to slow mutation rates (Jackson et al.,
2009) and demographic factors such as recent population expansion
following bottlenecks or behaviour (Oremus et al., 2009).
Patterns of population structure are evident in most cetacean
species, even those with seemingly continuous distributions and high
mobility. For example, many baleen whales are highly philopatric,
returning to calving or feeding grounds each year, leading to patterns
of population structure between these grounds (Alter et al., 2009). The
long lifespan of these animals, and extended period of maternal care,
allows the cultural transmission of this philopatry over long time
periods despite signiﬁcant population depletion. In killer whales
(Orcinus orca), population differentiation is thought to result from a
highly matrifocal social system (Hoelzel et al., 1998). It has been
suggested that the lack of gene ﬂow between such matrifocal groups
has, in the longer term, led to the development of sympatric
subspecies
that
are
speciﬁc
to
a
particular
habitat
or
prey
(Morin et al., 2010). Furthermore, some wide-ranging cetacean species
show local specialization. For example, common dolphins (Delphinus
delphis) are a highly mobile pelagic species, yet genetic differentiation
has been detected between animals from South Australia and those
from the eastern coast of Tasmania, ~ 1500 km apart (Bilgmann et al.,
2008). This differentiation is likely due to a dependence on speciﬁc
regional oceanographic features such as upwellings that inﬂuence prey
distributions, for example, the Bonney Upwelling (Butler et al., 2002).
Whether these trends are evident in beaked whales has previously been
unknown, and difﬁcult to quantify given the problem with obtaining
genetic samples.
Although patterns of population structure are known in other
cetaceans, beaked whales remain enigmatic, with few published studies
describing their populations. The ziphiids, or beaked whales, are one
of the most speciose families of cetaceans, second only to the
delphinids. Of the 22 species of beaked whale, 15 can be found within
the genus Mesoplodon. Members of this genus are cryptic in their
appearance and behaviour (Pitman, 2009). It has been assumed that
their general biology is similar and most are thought to be deep-diving
squid eaters that live in small groups along continental shelf edges.
However, much of the information on the biology of these whales is
derived from stranded animals combined with extrapolation from data
collected on the few species that can be observed at sea (e.g., Wimmer
and Whitehead, 2004; McSweeney et al., 2007).

Long-term cetacean sighting surveys off the east coast of the United
States suggest that beaked whales cluster into ecological niches that are
different from all other odontocetes (Schick et al., 2011). For example,
Cuvier’s (Ziphius cavirostris) and Sowerby’s (Mesoplodon bidens)
beaked whales occupy a different area of the continental shelf than
do other squid-eating species such as sperm whales (Physeter macro-
cephalus). Moreover, there is evidence that these two beaked whale
species may, in turn, occupy slightly different habitats within this area.
Tagging data from Blainville’s beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris)
have revealed a relationship between foraging behaviour and oceano-
graphic features, for example, water depth, movements of the deep
scattering layer of mesopelagic prey and seabed topography (Johnson
et al., 2008). Indeed, tagging data suggest that Cuvier’s beaked whales
perform the deepest dives of all mammals, almost 3000 m (Schorr
et al., 2014). Furthermore, modelling implies that beaked whales
require larger, higher quality habitats than other cetaceans to meet the
energetic needs of such deep diving (Wright et al., 2011; New
et al., 2013).
Where surveys have facilitated population size estimates, for
example, west coast United States, it has been found that many
beaked whale species have undergone signiﬁcant population declines
(Moore and Barlow, 2013). As beaked whales are particularly
vulnerable to anthropogenic noise, it is speculated that these popula-
tion declines are because of an increase in anthropogenic disturbance,
further highlighting the need for a better understanding of the basic
spatial requirements of all beaked whale species globally (Weilgart,
2007). However, in most areas of the world, and for most beaked
whale species, these data are not available. The status of species
inhabiting the remote areas of the Southern Ocean and seas around
New Zealand is, as yet, undetermined.
New Zealand has the highest recorded number of species of
stranded beaked whale in the world; 13 of the 22 recognized species,
and some of the most rarely sighted (Thompson et al., 2012;
Thompson et al., 2013; Constantine et al., 2014). One of the most
frequent species to strand around the coast is the Gray’s beaked whale
(Mesoplodon grayi) (Figure 1). This whale is a medium-sized (4.0–
5.5 m) mesoplodont with a circumpolar southern hemisphere dis-
tribution (Figure 2a). Distributions have been primarily inferred from
analyses of stranding data and live sightings are extremely rare. Most
records are generally from south of 33° latitude, particularly on New
Zealand, Australian, South African and South American coasts,
including the sub-Antarctic and Antarctic waters, with one record
from the Netherlands (Boschema, 1950; Dalebout et al., 2004; Taylor
et al., 2008; Van Waerebeek et al., 2010; Scheidat et al., 2011). Similar
to other beaked whales, Gray’s are assumed to live along the
continental shelf edge, although there are occasional sightings of
animals in shallow waters (e.g., Dalebout et al., 2004). An analysis of
stranding patterns around New Zealand suggests that summer peaks
are associated with inshore movements related to calving or nursing,
particularly around the North Island (Thompson et al., 2013).
Moreover, Gray’s beaked whales have subtle morphological differences
between the east and west coasts of New Zealand (Thompson et al.,
2014) and this might indicate restricted gene ﬂow between the two
coasts.
Behavioural studies of other beaked whales, for example, the
northern bottlenose whale (Hyperoodon ampullatus), suggest speciﬁc
dependencies on oceanographic features, such as submarine canyons,
have resulted in genetically isolated populations (Dalebout et al.,
2006). To date, there is no information on the foraging habitat or prey
of Gray’s beaked whales, although MacLeod et al. (2003) have
speculated that this species relies more on small benthic ﬁsh than
other beaked whales. The seabed topography around New Zealand is
diverse, supporting a variety of mesopelagic squid and ﬁsh (De Leo
et al., 2010). Around the continental shelf edge, there are several areas
of periodic high primary productivity resulting from upwelling of
slope-associated deep water (MacDiarmid et al., 2013). Many marine
mammals are known to take advantage of these upwellings for
foraging (Torres, 2013; Sagnol et al., 2014). In the case of Gray’s
beaked whales, it is unclear whether the species take advantage of these
upwellings, although stranding patterns appear to indicate use of the
highly productive areas of the continental shelf of the north east of the
North Island of New Zealand, particularly in summer (Thompson
et al., 2013). We hypothesize that, given the spatial scale from the east
to west coast of New Zealand, we would expect genetic structure in
Gray’s beaked whales in line with morphological differences, with
habitat dependency, as a result of specialization to local prey or
breeding areas, as the driver of differentiation. Furthermore, we
suggest that such genetic divergence is likely to be greater over a
larger spatial scale (6000 km) between the Chatham Islands and
Western Australia.
To test this hypothesis, we analysed sequence data from 530 bp of
mitochondrial control region and 12 variable microsatellite loci to
investigate diversity, population structure and effective population
size from 94 Gray’s beaked whale samples. These samples were
collected from strandings around the coast of New Zealand, with an
additional six samples from Western Australia representing the
largest global collection of this species. We provide novel insights
into the population dynamics of this enigmatic, and rarely sighted,
species.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study area and sample collection
We collected samples from a region spanning more than 6000 km extending
from the west coast of Australia to the Chatham Islands (New Zealand) in the
east (Figure 2). Samples from New Zealand were obtained from the New
Zealand Cetacean Tissue Archive and cover the period from 1991 to 2013.
Samples from Australia were collected over a 3-year period and were obtained
from the Western Australian Museum (for specimen details see Supplementary
Tables S1 and S2 and Supplementary Information). Further samples from
South Australia and Tasmania were not available in sufﬁcient numbers to allow
any meaningful analyses. Sex of all samples was determined by ampliﬁcation of
the SRY gene multiplexed with a ZFX/ZFY-positive control (Aasen and
Medrano, 1990; Gilson et al., 1998; Thompson et al., 2012). Samples from
New Zealand were divided into four a priori regional areas according to where

on the coast the animal was found and the Australian samples provided a ﬁfth
regional grouping (Figures 2b and c). These areas were based on the location of
known marine biogeographic barriers resulting from seabed topography and
oceanographic currents (Ayers and Waters, 2005).
DNA extraction, sequencing and genotyping
Genomic DNA was isolated from tissue using proteinase K digestion followed
by a standard 25:24:1 Phenol:Chloroform:Isoamyl protocol as described by
Sambrook et al. (1989) and modiﬁed by Baker et al. (1994), followed by ethanol
precipitation. A 530 bp fragment of DNA from the mitochondrial control
region was ampliﬁed and sequenced in both directions according to methods
described in Thompson et al. (2013) using the primer pair Dlp1.5 and
Dlp8G. Sequences were trimmed by eye in the programme GENEIOUS v7.1
(www.geneious.com), and only those sequences that reached a PHRED score of
40 or above for at least 70% of individual bases were deemed acceptable for
analyses (Kearse et al., 2012). The ﬁrst base of the control region was designated
to be position 15 468 in reference to the Gray’s beaked whale whole
mitogenome (GenBank accession no. KF981442). Sequences were aligned using
MAFFT (Multiple Alignment using Fast Fourier Transform) multiple sequence
alignment tool (Katoh et al., 2002).
Genotype data from 12 microsatellite loci (one di-, three tri- and eight tetra-
repeats) were obtained using primers and methods developed by Patel et al.
(2014). MICROCHECKER (Van Oosterhout et al., 2004) was used to assess
evidence of scoring error due to stuttering, large allele dropout and null alleles.
Deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium and linkage disequilibrium
between loci were tested in ARLEQUIN 3.5 (Excofﬁer and Lischer, 2010).
Genetic diversity
For mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data, haplotypic (h) and nucleotide (π)
diversities were calculated using ARLEQUIN. The nucleotide substitution
model used to calculate genetic distance was the Tamura and Nei model
with a gamma correction of α = 0.219 as determined in jModelTest using the
corrected Akaike information criterion (Tamura and Nei, 1993; Posada,
2008). For genotype data, average allelic richness (Rs), observed and
expected heterozygosities were calculated per microsatellite locus and per
putative
population
using
GENODIVE
2.3b23
(Meirmans
and
Van
Tienderen, 2004). Measures of genetic diversity can be highly dependent
on sample size, in that larger populations are likely to have more alleles than
smaller populations; therefore, allelic richness values were also calculated
per population using the rarefaction method implemented in HP-RARE 1.0
(Kalinowski, 2005). This method statistically adjusts for sample size by
calculating the number of alleles as a function of the sample size per
population.
To identify any genetic signature of demographic expansion or population
bottleneck in the mtDNA, Fu’s Fs statistic was calculated, as implemented in
ARLEQUIN. Fu’s Fs is one of the more sensitive indicators of deviation from
neutral population equilibrium (Ramos-Onsins and Rozas, 2002). Departure
from neutral expectation was inferred by randomization using a coalescent
algorithm run for 10 000 steps (Hudson, 1990). Negative values of Fu’s Fs

statistic are indicative of historical population expansion or genetic hitchhiking,
and a positive value is evidence of a recent population bottleneck and a
deﬁciency of alleles at this locus (Fu, 1997).
Population structure
To visualize the geographic distribution of mtDNA haplotypes and their
relationships, the program POPART was used to construct a median joining
network (University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand; http://popart.otago.ac.
nz). We estimated a phylogenetic tree of samples using a variant of Bayesian
inference (Mr Bayes) with two Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler runs of
1.1 × 106 generations and the nucleotide substitution model as determined by
jModelTest (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2001). Blainville’s beaked whale
(M. densirostris) and Gervais’ beaked whale (Mesoplodon europeaus) were
selected as outgroups. Trees were sampled every 200 generations and it was
determined by visual inspection of posterior traces of both runs that stationarity
was attained by 1.1× 105 generations. The ﬁrst 1.1 × 105 generations were
discarded as burn-in leaving the remaining samples to estimate a consensus tree
and posterior probabilities.
An analysis of molecular variance and pairwise F-statistics were calculated for
mtDNA and microsatellites in ARLEQUIN and GENODIVE, respectively.
Three F-statistics were used: standard Fst based on mtDNA haplotype and
microsatellite allele frequencies; Φst that incorporates molecular sequence
divergence in mtDNA and, F′st that is a standardised Fst statistic that takes
into account within-population genetic variation for microsatellites (Meirmans
and Hedrick, 2011). Pairwise exact tests were also carried out and signiﬁcance
of all F-statistics was tested using 10 000 permutations. Analysis of molecular
variance and F-statistics were analysed by each sex separately (data not shown)
and for the combined data set.
Population structure was also investigated using a Bayesian clustering analysis
to estimate the most probable number of populations using STRUCTURE 2.3.4
(Pritchard et al., 2000). Analysis of microsatellite data was conducted with and
without sampling location priors using the admixture model. The number of
clusters (K) with the highest posterior probability was identiﬁed using replicate
runs assuming K from 1 to 5. The burn-in length was set at 100 000 steps,
followed by 1 000 000 steps with a total of 10 replicates for each value of K. The
most likely number of homogeneous clusters was assessed using the second-
order rate of change or ΔK method following Evanno et al. (2005) and
implemented in STRUCTURE HARVESTER (Earl and vonHoldt, 2012).
Results were then combined in the program CLUMPP to average individual
clustering outputs between runs (Jakobsson and Rosenberg, 2007) and
visualized in DISTRUCT (Rosenberg, 2004). A principal component analysis
was used to further visualize differences in genotypic variation between
populations and individuals as implemented in R using the package ADE-
GENET (Jombart, 2008).
Estimating effective population size
Mitochondrial control region sequences were used to estimate effective female
population size (Nef) using a Bayesian skyline plot approach implemented in
BEAST v.1.8.0 (Drummond et al., 2012). The substitution model (TN93) with
discrete gamma distribution with four rate categories was selected as the model
of evolution having been previously determined in jModelTest. A strict
molecular clock approach was used that assumed a control region mutation
rate of 0.9× 10−8 bp per year (Cuvier’s beaked whales; Dalebout et al., 2005),
and 2 × 10−7 bp per year derived from ancient DNA sampling (bowhead
whales (Balaena mysticetus); Ho et al., 2007, 2011). The Markov chain Monte
Carlo chains were run with 3 × 107 iterations and samples were drawn every
30 000 iterations with the ﬁrst 10% being discarded as burn-in. Population
history was inferred using the Bayesian skyline plot with 10 groups of coalescent
intervals. Two independent BEAST analyses were combined and in all cases
convergence to stationary distribution and sufﬁcient sampling were visually
checked in TRACER v.1.6 (Rambaut et al., 2013).
RESULTS
Genetic diversity
A total of 94 individuals were sequenced resulting in 38 mitochondrial
haplotypes deﬁned by 26 variable sites (Supplementary Table S3 and
Supplementary Information; GenBank accession numbers: KJ767593–
KJ767630). Diversity statistics suggest that Gray’s beaked whales have
moderately high levels of variation within the study areas and both
haplotype (h) and nucleotide (π) diversity were found to be similar
between regions (Table 1). The same 94 individuals were genotyped at
12 microsatellite loci. The average number of alleles (k), allelic richness
and private allelic richness were similar among regions. The only
exception being k, which was lower in both the south west of
New Zealand and Western Australia where there were fewer samples
than in the other areas (Table 1). No microsatellite loci deviated
from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium and there was no signiﬁcant
linkage disequilibrium between loci after Bonferroni correction
(Supplementary Table S4 and Supplementary Information). Loci
showed no evidence for null alleles, large allelic dropout or scoring
errors due to stutter peaks. The average amount of missing allelic data
per locus was 0.35%. Diversity statistics per loci are given in
Supplementary Table S5.
Fu’s Fs value was negative and highly signiﬁcant (−23.01, Po0.001)
and indicative of historical demographic expansion or selective sweep,
and an excess of rare substitutions and haplotypes at this locus. These
results suggest that it is unlikely that Gray’s beaked whales have
suffered any historical genetic bottleneck.
Population structure
The median joining network of haplotypes showed no phylogeo-
graphic structure and common haplotypes were shared across the
study area (Supplementary Figure S1). Moreover, the network is
highly reticulated and most haplotypes are sister lineages in that they

differ by only a single substitution. This pattern is also reﬂected in the
Bayesian tree (Supplementary Figure S2).
Pairwise comparisons between populations showed no signiﬁcant
differentiation in either mtDNA or microsatellites at the Po0.05
level (Table 2). This lack of signiﬁcance held true whether the sexes
were combined or separated (data not shown). Bayesian clustering
analyses implemented in STRUCTURE showed no population struc-
ture for microsatellite data. The highest average posterior probability
occurred at K = 1 and graphical outputs from DISTRUCT showed that
with increasing values of K, all populations became increasingly
subdivided into multiple clusters approximately proportional to the
sample size for a priori regions (Figure 3). Both STRUCTURE
analyses, with and without priors, revealed the same results. Principal
component analysis showed all populations overlapping in genotypes
with no visible differentiation between any of the a priori regions
(Supplementary Figure S3).
Estimate of effective population size
Using the mutation rate derived from Cuvier’s beaked whale, the
product of female Nef and generation time was calculated to be 10.14
million with 95% credibility intervals of 0.39–51.79 million. Using the
faster mutation rate from bowhead whales, the product of female Nef
and generation time was calculated to 0.46 million with 95%
credibility intervals of 0.02–2.25 million (Figure 4). Estimation of
Nef from microsatellite data using programs such as NeEstimator have
not been reported, as these methods produced unreliable estimates
and are known to be inappropriate for estimating the size of large
populations, particularly with high levels of gene ﬂow.
DISCUSSION
We analysed samples collected from around the coast of New Zealand
and Western Australia in the largest study on beaked whale population
genetics to date. Our ﬁndings show that Gray’s beaked whales have
high mitochondrial haplotype and nucleotide diversity relative to
most beaked whales (Gray’s (530 bp): h = 0.93–0.94, π = 0.76–0.99%;
Blainville’s
(362 bp):
h = 0.87± 0.07;
π = 0.49± 0.35%;
northern
bottlenose (434 bp): h = 0.57; π = 0.15%), with the exception of the
southern bottlenose whale (Hyperoodon planifrons) (238 bp): h = 0.97;
π = 3.73% (Dalebout, 2002; Dalebout et al., 2001, 2005) (Table 3).
Southern bottlenose whales also have a distribution extending
throughout the Southern Ocean and have never been a target of
whaling. The level of diversity observed in both these beaked whales
contrasts with that found in pilot whales (Globicephala melas) and false
killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens), where social factors are thought to
contribute to low diversity (Whitehead, 1998). Spinner dolphins
(Stenella longirostris longirostris) in the waters of French Polynesia
are also pelagic, with a distribution concentrated around particular
island groups and signiﬁcant gene ﬂow between these areas (Oremus
et al., 2007). Our diversity statistics are comparable to this species and

it is likely that Gray’s beaked whales show similar levels of movement
and gene ﬂow.
Our estimation of Fu’s Fs is negative and highly signiﬁcant,
indicating a population expansion or a selective sweep. A rapid
radiation of Gray’s beaked whales during their divergence from the
most recent common ancestor could potentially explain these signa-
tures. However, the phylogeny of the ziphiids is currently in question
as new and more informative genomic markers enable its revision
(Morin et al., 2013). Gray’s beaked whales are unlikely to have
undergone any recent genetic population bottleneck, although our
data reﬂect long-term historical demographic patterns, and cannot
determine more recent population changes. This species has no
documented history of human consumption in this region and,
therefore, these results are perhaps unsurprising (Robards and
Reeves, 2011). However, there is the potential that a pelagic species
such as Gray’s beaked whales is impacted upon by ﬁsheries by-catch
and, given the difﬁculties in carcass recovery and species identiﬁcation,
assessment data is currently unavailable (Madsen et al., 2014). To
detect more recent population changes both census data and alter-
native genetic markers would be required, and current by-catch rates
would be helpful in assessing potential human-induced mortality.
Our study is limited by small sample size from Australia, and
therefore our results comparing Gray’s beaked whale population
structure across to New Zealand are preliminary. However, in general,
our analyses of data from both mtDNA and microsatellite markers
indicate a lack of genetic structure across the ~ 6000km-wide study
area. None of the pairwise comparisons of genetic differentiation
based on Fst were signiﬁcant at the Po0.05 level, and therefore our
results are consistent with a single Gray’s beaked whale population.
However, further samples from Australia are needed to conﬁrm these
ﬁndings.
Overall, this result contrasts with our original hypothesis predicting
restricted gene ﬂow between east and west coasts of New Zealand.
Studies of population structure in beaked whales are inherently
difﬁcult because of the paucity of material available for genetic
analysis; however, in northern bottlenose whales signiﬁcant genetic
structure was detected across a distance of ~ 2000 km between The
Gully, off Nova Scotia, and the Labrador Sea (Dalebout et al., 2006).
This structure is thought to result from a combination of habitat
speciﬁcity, that is, the need to associate with submarine canyons, and a
genetic bottleneck because of hunting (Dalebout et al., 2001). Cuvier’s
and Blainville’s beaked whales are both cosmopolitan species that are
broadly distributed throughout the world’s oceans. These species show
clear differentiation between ocean basins, with little contemporary
interoceanic gene ﬂow (Dalebout et al., 2005; Morin et al., 2013). This
differentiation is thought to reﬂect patterns of long-term divergence as
a result of the species’ radiation, habitat preferences and/or social
organization. Such genetic structure is not unusual for marine
organisms with either site ﬁdelity to breeding grounds, for example,
white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) (Bonﬁl et al., 2005), or feeding
grounds, for example, herring (Clupea harengus) (Gaggiotti et al.,
2009).
In contrast, given the results of our study, interoceanic gene ﬂow is
highly likely in the case of Gray’s beaked whales, particularly as there
are no large continents that restrict movement throughout their
distribution. This pattern is the ﬁrst described in the genus Mesoplo-
don, and while our samples cover approximately one-third of the
species’ range, further samples are needed from South Africa, South
America and the Southern Ocean to conﬁrm this ﬁnding. There are
both ﬁsh and squid species that exhibit similar levels of connectivity
across comparable spatial scales (e.g., orange roughy (Hoplostethus
atlanticus), Varela et al., 2012; giant squid (Architeuthis spp.),
Winkelmann et al., 2013) and it is likely that there are aspects of
these species’ population biology that are common.
Thompson et al. (2013) suggests that, given stranding patterns,
seasonal shifts in distribution associated with the calving season are
likely in Gray’s beaked whales, perhaps in relation to a dependency on
inshore waters. However, should these preferences exist they are
clearly not driving long-term genetic differentiation or there is enough
habitat of sufﬁcient quality within the study area to support multiple
calving grounds. Interestingly, the morphological differences seen in
Gray’s beaked whales between the east and west coasts of New Zealand
are not reﬂected in the genetic data (Thompson et al., 2014). This
suggests that such morphological differences occur in the presence of
gene ﬂow and could perhaps result from phenotypic plasticity and/or
dietary preferences. There are several examples of such phenotypic
plasticity in cetaceans, for example, bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops
truncatus) (Viaud-Martinez et al., 2008) and killer whales (Foote et al.,
2009). These examples are thought to indicate ecological differences
and are accompanied by an associated genetic divergence, but this is
not the case in our study.
Given the degree of genetic homogeneity found between all regions,
these results suggest that it is unlikely that the whales found off the
coast of Western Australia are distinct from those found around the

Heredity
coast of New Zealand. We speculate that Gray’s beaked whales may
move freely between these areas perhaps following the subtropical
convergence, the boundary between cold sub-Antarctic and warmer
subtropical waters, that dominates the centre of this species distribu-
tion (Garner, 1959; Heath, 1981). A number of marine mammal
species are known to take advantage of this convergence, which is
associated with areas of high primary productivity. Sightings surveys
off the coast of south Australia have detected several beaked whales
(Gill et al., 2015) with one particular sighting involving a single group
of 20 unidentiﬁed mesoplodonts largely ﬁtting the description of
Gray’s beaked whales (P. Gill, pers. comm.). It is highly possible that
such an oceanographic feature, which can be as productive as the
Benguela Upwelling (van Ruth et al., 2010), may facilitate movements
of Gray’s beaked whales and act as a gene ﬂow ‘conveyer belt’ between
New Zealand and Australia.
The panmictic pattern in Gray’s beaked whales may also be a result
of social factors that promote gene ﬂow, as has been suggested in
common dolphins in the North Atlantic. Gray’s are unique among the
beaked whales in that they commonly strand in groups. The holotype
specimen was one of 28 animals stranded in the Chatham Islands in
1875 (von Haast, 1876), and other large strandings (4–6 animals)
occur frequently around New Zealand (New Zealand Department of
Conservation, unpublished data). It has been proposed that these
larger strandings are breeding aggregations as in some cases they
include multiple adult males, although further behavioural evidence
would be required to conﬁrm this (Dalebout, 2002). Whether these
larger groups are formed for the purpose of mating is unknown but it
is possible that Gray’s beaked whales have a mating system that is
distinct from other ziphiids and more akin to what has been described
in the delphinids. The high levels of genetic diversity and a lack of
differentiation across the geographical range of our study may imply a
promiscuous
and/or
polygynous
mating
system
that
promotes
gene ﬂow.
There are many limitations to estimates of female effective popula-
tion size; several assumptions of the coalescent model are violated
because of the lack of basic knowledge of this species biology.
However, based on mitochondrial data, our analyses imply that Gray’s
beaked whales have existed as an increasing population with no
historical population bottleneck.
Given a plausible generation time for Gray’s beaked whales of 15
years, as is estimated for Cuvier’s beaked whales (Dalebout et al., 2005)
and spinner dolphins (Oremus et al., 2007), our estimate of mean
female effective population size ranges from 676 000 (26 000–3.45
million, 95% CI) to a lower estimate of 30 600 (1333–150 000, 95%
CI). In all estimates, our credibility intervals highlight the high degree
of uncertainty, and upper limits of female effective population size of
whales do not generally reach into the millions, for example, Cuvier’s
beaked whales in the Southern Ocean have an upper limit of 189 000
(Dalebout et al., 2005) and the minke whale (Balaenoptera acutoros-
trata) upper limit is 800 000 (Alter and Palumbi, 2009). Although we
have applied a coalescent approach, which tends to be more accurate
than deterministic methods, there are still considerable limitations.
Effective population size estimates are strongly inﬂuenced by the
mutation rate, with underestimation of rates resulting in large over-
estimates in population size (Luikart et al., 2010). In general, Nef is
most difﬁcult to estimate in large populations with moderate gene
ﬂow and this difﬁculty can lead to extremely large conﬁdence intervals
as are seen in our estimates (Hare et al., 2011). In this context, we
suggest that our estimates of Nef should be considered as indicative of
a large population with no bottleneck. This contradicts the basic
assumption that, in general, beaked whales exist at naturally low
abundances and, hence, are rarely observed at sea (Pitman, 2009). In
the case of Gray's beaked whales, the rarity in sightings is more likely
due to their offshore distribution and cryptic behaviour, together with
a paucity of dedicated oceanic surveys.

Population genetics of Gray’s beaked whales

Heredity
In conclusion, our results suggest that Gray’s beaked whales form a
large panmictic population. It is most likely that signiﬁcant genetic
connectivity exists between the waters of New Zealand and Western
Australia. Although there are limitations in our sampling, and
consequently our analyses, our inability to detect genetic heterogeneity
throughout the study area suggests that there is an absence of any
particular habitat dependencies, social factors or historical population
depletion that have restricted gene ﬂow. We suggest, given the strength
of our ﬁndings, that Gray’s beaked whales in New Zealand and
Australian waters be managed as a single management unit. Our study
highlights the value of long-term stranding collections in studying
populations of elusive, long-lived, slow-breeding species. With more
extensive sampling, and higher resolution genetic markers (e.g., single-
nucleotide polymorphisms), we suggest that future research that helps
to elucidate any cryptic population structure in Gray’s beaked whales
would be a valuable contribution to the study of this species.
