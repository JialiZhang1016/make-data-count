Abstract
Background: In recent years, the planting area of sweet corn in China has expanded rapidly. Some new varieties
with high yields and good adaptabilities have emerged. However, the improvement of edible quality traits,
especially through the development of varieties with thin pericarp thickness, has not been achieved to date.
Pericarp thickness is a complex trait that is the key factor determining the edible quality of sweet corn. Genetic
mapping combined with transcriptome analysis was used to identify candidate genes controlling pericarp
thickness.
Results: To identify novel quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for pericarp thickness, a sweet corn BC4F3 population of 148
lines was developed using the two sweet corn lines M03 (recurrent parent) and M08 (donor parent). Additionally, a
high-density genetic linkage map containing 3876 specific length amplified fragment (SLAF) tags was constructed
and used for mapping QTLs for pericarp thickness. Interestingly, 14 QTLs for pericarp thickness were detected, and
one stable QTL (qPT10–5) was detected across multiple years, which explained 7.78–35.38% of the phenotypic
variation located on chromosome 10 (144,631,242-145,532,401). Forty-two candidate genes were found within the
target region of qPT10–5. Moreover, of these 42 genes, five genes (GRMZM2G143402, GRMZM2G143389,
GRMZM2G143352, GRMZM6G287947, and AC234202.1_FG004) were differentially expressed between the two parents,
as revealed by transcriptome analysis. According to the gene annotation information, three genes might be
considered candidates for pericarp thickness. GRMZM2G143352 and GRMZM2G143402 have been annotated as AUX/
IAA transcription factor and ZIM transcription factor, respectively, while GRMZM2G143389 has been annotated as
FATTY ACID EXPORT 2, chloroplastic.
Conclusions: This study identified a major QTL and candidate genes that could accelerate breeding for the thin
pericarp thickness variety of sweet corn, and these results established the basis for map-based cloning and further
functional research.

Background
Sweet corn is a maize-derived vegetable crop developed
through one or several recessive endosperm mutations
that reduce the synthesis of starch and increase the accu-
mulation of sugars or other short-chain polysaccharides.
The growing area of sweet corn has increased rapidly in
China. In recent years, some new varieties with high yields
and good adaptabilities have emerged. However, improve-
ment of edible quality traits, especially through the devel-
opment of varieties with reduced pericarp thickness, has
not been achieved to date. Kernel tenderness, crispness
and residue percentage of sweet corn are important cri-
teria for evaluating edible quality. Pericarp thickness and
structure are closely related to these three quality traits.
Thin pericarps show high softness, high crispness, low
residue rate, and good taste [1]. The pericarp of corn is
composed of nondigestible cellulose, which is neither nu-
tritious nor digestible, and the thickness of the pericarp af-
fects the tenderness of sweet corn. Thus, the selection of a
thinner pericarp is highly important in sweet corn quality
breeding programs. Reducing pericarp thickness has be-
come an important breeding goal to improve the edible
quality of sweet corn.
The genetic characteristics of maize pericarp thickness
have a high narrow sense heritability (55–82%) and in-
volve additive effects, dominant effects and significant
epistasis effects [2–4]. The number of effective genes as-
sociated with pericarp thickness estimates averaged 3.3
and ranged from 1.4 to 5.9 for the eight crosses [4]. To
date, no single gene with a major effect (> 25%) has been
identified. Haddad showed that the cell layer number of
maize hybrids was the same as that of their female par-
ents, and the difference in pericarp thickness was due to
the thickening of the cell wall of the hybrids, which indi-
cated that the thickness of the maize pericarp was af-
fected by both maternal and nuclear genes [5]. Tracy
and Schmidt analysed the pericarp thickness of 7 differ-
ent sweet corn near-isogenic lines that differed in endo-
sperm composition [sugary (su), dull (du), waxy (wx),
sugary-2 (su2), and shrunken-2 (sh2)] using a pressure
micrometer and found that the pericarp thickness was
significantly affected by embryo type, endosperm type,
endosperm by inbred interactions, ear, and position of
measurement on the kernel [6]. A study by Helm and
Zuber showed that the narrow heritability of pericarp
thickness was 0.80 and that pericarp thickness was con-
trolled by 3 to 8 semidominant, epistatic and additive
genes [2]. ITO and Brewbaker showed that pericarp
thickness was controlled by 2–5 semidominant genes
[4]. Therefore, the gene loci and their genetic effects
controlling pericarp thickness may be more easily identi-
fied and analysed by molecular methods.
To the best of our knowledge, few studies on linkage
mapping for maize pericarp thickness have been reported.
For example, eight chromosomal fragments affecting sweet
corn pericarp thickness were identified using restriction
fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers in a
chromosome segment substitute lines (CSSL) population
[7]. Wang and Brewbaker used 94 maize recombinant in-
bred lines and identified three pericarp thickness QTLs lo-
cated on chromosomes 1, 2 and 6 [8]. Forty-one QTLs
related to pericarp thickness were detected using 100 sim-
ple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Moreover, principal
component analysis indicated that the first principal com-
ponent composed of 8 QTLs could explain 87.60% of peri-
carp thickness phenotypic variance, which could be applied
in breeding thin pericarp maize varieties [9, 10]. Choe and
Rocheford TR also found that some QTLs controlling peri-
carp thickness in a waxy corn mapping panel were colo-
cated with ear trait QTLs, which may be due to the high
correlation between pericarp thickness and ear traits [11].
Eight pericarp thickness QTLs were detected based on two
genetic models using the 190 BC1F2 population. Three
QTLs for pericarp thickness were identified using the com-
posite interval mapping (CIM) method and explained 8.6,
16.0, and 7.2% of phenotypic variation, respectively. Based
on the mixed model-based CIM (MCIM) method, five
QTLs for pericarp thickness were detected [12]. Although
these investigations have been undertaken, no pericarp
thickness genes have been cloned to date. These genetic
maps commonly have low marker density, which makes it
difficult to cover the whole genome, thereby making QTL
analysis difficult. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) tech-
nology makes it possible to detect large quantities of SNP
markers covering the entire genome. Specific length ampli-
fied fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq), first developed by
Sun et al. [13], has been widely used for high-density gen-
etic map construction, such as cotton [14], grape [15], and
cucumber [16]. Compared with traditional molecular
markers, the distribution density of markers in genetic
mapping affects the accuracy of the mapping, and the
higher the density is, the more accurate the mapping is. In
addition, SLAF-seq has overcome the shortcomings of trad-
itional markers, which are more time-consuming and
labour-intensive. Therefore, SLAF-seq has been considered
as a cost-effective technique to develop high stability and
specificity molecular markers.
At present, tasting is a prevalent method for the com-
prehensive evaluation of sweet corn varieties by breeders.
Although this method is direct and practical, its disadvan-
tages include strong subjectivity and inaccurate phenotyp-
ing, making gene cloning difficult. Currently, with the
rapid development of multiomics technologies (e.g., gen-
omics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics, epige-
nomics, and lonomics), there are new opportunities to
explore genes involved in the formation of pericarp thick-
ness. Transcriptomics has been shown to be a powerful
tool for the large-scale identification of genes related to

specific traits in some crop species, including rice [17],
maize [18], wheat [19], barley [20], and cotton [21]. To
date, no RNA-seq study of pericarp thickness has been re-
ported; thus, a more effective method to identify genes re-
lated to pericarp thickness is developed by integrating
linkage analysis and transcriptome analysis. To identify
the genes controlling the pericarp thickness of sweet corn
and understand the genetic basis of the development of
pericarp thickness in sweet corn. In this study, we con-
structed a BC4F3 population using two sweet corn inbred
lines with different pericarp thicknesses. Therefore, our
aims are 1) to map pericarp thickness QTLs by linkage
mapping and 2) to propose candidate genes for those
QTLs based on complementary transcriptomic analyses.
These results may provide molecular markers for sweet
corn breeding with thinner pericarps and a theoretical
basis for quality improvement and industrialization of
sweet corn.
Results
Phenotypic analysis
The phenotypic data of the pericarp thickness of the
148 BC4F3 population and their two parents were col-
lected in autumn of 2014, 2015 and 2016. As shown in
Table 1, the pericarp thickness showed significant dif-
ferences between the two parental lines across the 3
years. Compared with the ‘M08’ inbred line, the pater-
nal parent ‘M03’ inbred line exhibited a lower pericarp
thickness. The pericarp thickness of the BC4F3 popula-
tion ranged from 30.63 to 104.21 μm and displayed a
continuous distribution. The skewness and kurtosis of
the trait ranged from 0.78–1.23 and 1.17–2.29, respect-
ively, and the broad sense heritability (h2) of 3 years
and cross years ranged from 0.66 to 0.73 (Table 1). The
distributions of pericarp thickness for the BC4F3 popu-
lation were determined for samples over the 3 years
and suggested that the segregation of this trait approxi-
mates the normal distribution and indicated that the
pericarp thickness is a typical quantitative trait that is
controlled by polygenes. A continuous distribution and
considerable transgressive segregation were shown in
the BC4F3 population, suggesting that both parents
contributed alleles towards pericarp thickness.
Positive correlations were observed among the traits
evaluated over the 3 years (Additional file 1: Table S1).
Correlation coefficients of pericarp thickness from the 3
years were found to be significant (P < 0.01) and were
correlated with each other in a range from r = 0.756 to
0.915. This result indicates that the pericarp thickness
was stable among different environments.
Identification of major pericarp thickness QTLs in the
BC4F3 population
DNA of the 148 BC4F3 population was sent to a bio-
marker company for SLAF sequencing. A total of 163,961
SLAF tags were obtained, in which the coverage depth of
the two parents was 42.15×, and the average sequencing
depth of the offspring was 5.47×. To improve the quality
of the genetic map, SLAFs were filtered according to Zhu’s
method: 1) parents sequence depth < 10×; 2) complete de-
gree < 30%; 3) partial separation significantly (P < 0.01); 4)
heterozygous in two parents [16].
A total of 3876 SNPs were obtained after filtering the ori-
ginal SLAF tags. Based on the locations of SLAF markers
on chromosomes, they were assigned into ten linkage
groups (LGs) according to the maize inbred line B73 refer-
ence genome (version 3) (ftp://ftp.ensemblgenomes.org/
pub/plants/release-24/fasta/zea_mays/dna/). The linear ar-
rangement of markers in the linkage group was obtained
using JoinMap4.1 software, and the genetic distance be-
tween adjacent markers was estimated. Finally, a genetic
map with a total map distance of 2413.25 cM was con-
structed. The number of markers on the map was 3876,
and the average map distance between markers was 0.62
cM (Additional file 2: Fig. S1; Additional file 3: Table S2).
Based on the constructed genetic linkage map, the
phenotype of the pericarp thickness of the BC4F3 popula-
tion collected from 2014, 2015, 2016 and the average of
those 3 years were analysed by QTL mapping. A total of 14
QTLs for pericarp thickness were mapped in the BC4F3
populations across 3 years. The QTLs were distributed on
maize chromosomes 1, 5, 6, 7, and 10. Seven QTLs associ-
ated with pericarp thickness were found on chromosomes
1 and 10, and the phenotypic variance explained by a single
QTL ranged from 3.36 to 7.78% in 2014. Three QTLs con-
trolling pericarp thickness were identified on chromosomes

5, 6, and 10, accounting for 26.32% of phenotypic variance
in 2015. Two QTLs (qPT7 and qPT10–5) were responsible
for pericarp thickness located on chromosomes 7 and 10,
respectively, explaining a total of 21.76% of phenotypic vari-
ance in 2016. Two QTLs were detected based on the aver-
age pericarp thickness of 3 years, which explained 3.22 and
35.38% of phenotypic variance. A stable qPT10–5, which
was located in a 901.2-kb (chr10: 145,172,996-145,532,401)
region, was identified in all 3 years and averaged across 3
years and could explain 7.78 to 35.38% of phenotypic varia-
tions among different years. This finding indicated that
qPT10–5 was the stable major locus interval controlling
sweet corn pericarp thickness (Fig. 1; Table 2). According
to the reference genome annotation information, forty-two
genes within the region of qpt10–5 were found.
Transcriptome profiling
To identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in
qPT10–5, the pericarp 19 days after pollination (DAP) for
two parents was used for transcriptome sequencing. Scan-
ning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of the pericarps of
the M03 and M08 lines (each sample with five replications)
at the 19th DAP was also performed, and the average peri-
carp thicknesses of M03 and M08 were 111.27 ± 9.19 μm
and 176.90 ± 13.86 μm, respectively (Fig. 2). Approximately
43.98 Gb of total nucleotide data were obtained from the
M03 and M08 lines by RNA sequencing. Three independ-
ent biological replicates were used in this experiment. We
obtained 49,153,314–54,655,798 reads for the inbred line
M03, and 67.77 to 69.94% were mapped to the B73 refer-
ence genome (version 3). For the inbred line M08, we ob-
tained 51,359,308-54,932,698 reads, and 70.06 to 70.46%
were mapped to the B73 reference genome (Additional file 4:
Table S3). A significantly high correlation (Additional file 5:
Table S4) was observed between the two biological replica-
tions, revealing steady expression profiling between the rep-
licated samples. In this study, a total of 4381 DEGs were
identified between the M03 and M08 lines (|fold change| ≥
2 and FDR < 0.01). Among these genes, 2318 were upregu-
lated and 2063 were downregulated in the M03 line.
Gene Ontology-based enrichment analysis was carried
out using a threshold value (FDR < 0.01) to evaluate the
major biological functions of the DEGs (Fig. 3). These
genes were further classified into three main categories,
including biological processes (BP), cellular components
(CC) and molecular functions (MF). The BP category
contained half of the GO annotations (18,418; 50.96%)
followed by the CC category (12,965; 35.87%) and the
MF category (4757; 13.17%). Under the biological pro-
cesses category, cysteine biosynthetic process, response

Candidate gene prediction in qpt10–5 based on
transcriptome analysis
Forty-two candidate genes in the qpt10–5 region were
compared with the DEGs identified by transcriptome se-
quencing. Among the 42 genes, 18 were found in the tran-
scriptome sequencing (Additional file 6: Table S5). Only
five genes, GRMZM6G287947, AC234202.1_FG004, GRM
ZM2G143402,
GRMZM2G143352
and
GRMZM2G14
3389, were differentially expressed between the M03 and
M08 lines (Table 3). Gene annotation indicated that
GRMZM2G143352, GRMZM2G143402, and GRMZM2
G143389 may be candidate genes that control pericarp
thickness.
Of
these
genes,
GRMZM2G143352
and
AC234202.1_FG004 were upregulated in the M08 line,
whereas
GRMZM2G143389,
GRMZM6G287947,
and
GRMZM2G143402 were downregulated in the M08 line.
To confirm the results obtained from transcriptome se-
quencing, these genes were selected for qRT-PCR valid-
ation. As expected, the expression patterns of the 5
selected genes obtained from qRT-PCR were similar to

those obtained by transcriptome sequencing (Fig. 5). Fur-
thermore, the full-length versions of those three genes
in
the
M03
and
M08
lines
were
sequenced.
GRMZM2G143352 in the M08 line was missing a
CGCG and ACCTCG sequence in front of the initiation
codon and coding sequence compared with the se-
quence from the M03 line. Although the coding se-
quence was the same, GRMZM2G143402 in the M08
line had a 362-bp sequence insertion in the promoter,
which contained a PIF-Harbinger transposon (Fig. 6).
GRMZM2G143389 had a copy of CCGCTCA in the
promoter of the M08 line compared with M03 (Add-
itional file 7: Fig. S2). Variation in these three genes
may lead to differences in pericarp thickness between
the two parents. These results may facilitate the fine
mapping of the qPT10–5 locus, and further experi-
ments are needed to identify functional genes and iden-
tify causes of the differences in pericarp thickness.
Discussion
Characteristics of the SLAF-seq method
Compared to other sequencing techniques combined with
restriction
enzyme
digestion
(such
as
genotyping-by-
sequencing and restriction-site-associated DNA sequen-
cing), SLAF-seq was measured by sequencing the specific
length amplified fragment, which has better repeatability.
Exploring numerous stable and reliable molecular markers
is the key step for high-density genetic map construction.
Once the genome is digested by restriction endonuclease(s),
choosing fragments correctly for sequencing would be a bet-
ter representation of the genome. In this study, the total
number of SLAF markers was more than 520,000, and the
number of polymorphic markers was 31,582. This result is
difficult to achieve with traditional molecular markers. Fur-
thermore, all the markers covered the whole genome, which
ensured the accuracy of the final mapping. The labels with

the bias separation labels could be filtered out. All of these
beneficial properties simplified the genome sequencing,
which proves the superiority of this technique in genetic
mapping. On the other hand, due to the large number of
markers, complex populations and other factors, the se-
quencing results also increased the difficulty and challenge
of the mapping analysis. Although the construction of the
linkage map and its application in common corn have been
widely applied [22, 23], few studies have been published
about genetic mapping of the whole genome in sweet corn.
In this study, we provide a reference for follow-up genetic
research on sweet corn.
Pericarp thickness QTL mapping results compared with
other studies
With the rapid development of molecular biotechnology
and bioinformatics, plant gene mapping has made con-
siderable progress. Previous studies have shown that a
total of 190 BC1F2 families crossed by two cultivars with
different pericarp thicknesses were used as the mapping
population. Eight QTLs were found to be linked to peri-
carp thickness and mapped to chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6
and 8 [12]. In addition, 33 QTLs were detected by 264
F2:3 families crossed by the Korean waxy maize inbred
lines BH20 and BH30, and these loci were located on
chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, and 10 [11]. In this study,
based on the previous research conclusions, pericarp
thickness of the upper abgerminal part was regarded as
a representative to determine the sweet corn pericarp
thickness. Finally, a major QTL locus was found on
chromosome 10 and could explain 7.78 to 13.84% of
phenotypic variations among different years. Phenotypic
variance explained by a QTL was estimated based on the
same data that were used to detect the QTL, which
could cause the R2 values to be biased upwards [24].
Among the chromosomes, 10 chromosomes had the
most frequently linked markers. This result is different
from that of Yu et al. but is similar to that of Choe and
Rocheford [11, 12]. It was found that the loci mapped
on the same chromosome were generally adjacent to
their predecessors. Therefore, the chromosome may
have the same major gene loci as previous generations.
Candidate gene analysis
GRMZM2G143352 is an AUX/IAA transcription factor,
GRMZM2G143402 is a ZIM transcription factor, and
GRMZM2G143389 is the chloroplastic FATTY ACID
EXPORT 2 protein. Both GRMZM2G143352 and GRMZ
M2G143402 were related to plant hormone signal trans-
duction, and GRMZM2G143389 was related to fatty acid
degradation pathways, which is consistent with the re-
sults of the KEGG enrichment analysis (Fig. 4). Further-
more, the full-length gene sequences of these three
genes are different between the M03 and M08 lines.

Variation in these three genes may lead to differences in
pericarp thickness between the two parents.
GRMZM2G143352 is an AUX/IAA transcription fac-
tor that mediates many aspects of plant responses to
auxin [25]. The functions of most Aux/IAAs have been
defined mainly by gain-of-function mutant alleles in
Arabidopsis thaliana [26]. Two different classes of tran-
scription factors are involved in the regulation of auxin
signalling, AUX/IAAs and AUXIN RESPONSE FAC-
TORS (ARFs). ARFs bind directly to auxin response ele-
ments in the promoter region of auxin-responsive genes
via their conserved DNA-binding domain (DBD). When
auxin is low, AUX/IAA proteins bind to ARFs, prevent-
ing the expression of auxin-responsive genes. A high
level of auxin promotes ubiquitination and degradation
of AUX/IAAs though SCFTIR1/AFB and the 26 s prote-
asome, leading to the activation of auxin-response genes
by ARFs [27, 28]. These response genes may be related
to pericarp development.
We know that auxin treatment can promote the ex-
pression of AUX/IAA genes [29, 30]. We found that the
expression level of GRMZM2G143352 in the M08 line
was higher than that in the M03 line, indicating that the
auxin level of the M08 line could be higher than that in
the M03 line. Auxin is an important cell cycle regulator
[31]. The level of auxin affects cell growth, lowers con-
centrations of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and can pro-
mote the elongation of tobacco BY-2 cells but has no
effect on cell division. However, cell division was accel-
erated, but cell elongation was inhibited at relatively
high IAA concentrations [32, 33]. These findings are
consistent with our results (Fig. 3).
GRMZM2G143402 is a ZIM transcription factor that is
a repressor of JA (jasmonate) in maize [34]. The JA signal
regulates plant growth, development and defence re-
sponses. JAZ (jasmonate ZIM domain) transcription re-
pressors bind directly to JA-responsive genes. Without the
JA ((3R,7S)-jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine) signal, JAZ regulates
the JA-mediated response by inhibiting the transcriptional
activity of JA signalling-responsive transcription factors
[35, 36]. When the JA signal appeared, the JA receptor
specifically combined with JAZ, resulting in JAZ ubiquiti-
nation and degradation by proteasomes, relieving JAZ’s in-
hibition of JA transcriptional regulation and causing
physiological changes [37]. Through regulating the devel-
opment of the stomata, JA can improve the ability of
plants to cope with various external stresses [38]. Some
components of the JA signalling pathway can be inde-
pendently involved in plant stomatal development regula-
tion [39]. The size of the stoma and the open state may be
one of the reasons for the difference in pericarp thickness.
According to the gene annotation, GRMZM2G143389 is
the fatty acid export 2 (FAX2) chloroplastic protein. Fatty
acid synthesis in plants occurs in plastids; therefore, it
needs to export for acyl editing and lipid assembly in the
cytoplasm and endoplasmic reticulum. However, plastid
fatty acids’ transport mechanism has not been elucidated.
The function of fatty acid output 1 (fax1) is essential for
biomass and male reproductive capacity [40], while FAX2
function is unknown. Hence, it would be highly interesting
if we could prove the association of this gene with sweet
corn pericarp thickness. Therefore, additional evidence is
required to demonstrate the potential role of these genes
in the pericarp thickness of sweet corn.
Conclusions
In our study, we created a BC4F3 population and con-
structed a high-density genetic linkage map that had an
average genetic distance of 0.62 cM between adjacent
markers by the SLAF approach. Based on this high-
density genome map, a total of 14 QTLs for pericarp
thickness were detected, and one stable QTL (qPT10–5)
was detected across multiple years, which explained 7.78–
35.38% of the phenotypic variation located on chromo-
some 10. Moreover, five genes of the target region of
qPT10–5 were differentially expressed between the two
parents, as revealed by transcriptome analysis. According
to the gene annotation information, three genes might be
considered candidates for pericarp thickness. This study
identified a major QTL and candidate genes that could ac-
celerate breeding for thin pericarp thickness varieties of
sweet corn, and these results established the basis for
map-based cloning and further functional research.
Methods
Plant material
Two sweet corn inbred lines, M03 and M08, were selected
as parents to develop a BC4F3 mapping population. The
two lines show different pericarp thicknesses; as the recur-
rent parent, M03 is a thinner pericarp thickness; as the
donor parent, M08 is a thicker pericarp thickness line. All
plant materials used in this study were generously pro-
vided by Prof. Xiaoqin Li (College of Agriculture, South
China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China). The
mapping population consisted of 148 lines, and evaluation
of background recovery rates showed only 8 lines whose
genetic background recovery rates were less than 90%; the
recovery rates of the other lines were higher than 90%, the
highest rate was 99.99%, and the average background re-
covery rate was 95.91%. These results showed that the
genetic background of the BC4F3 population was largely
the same as that of the recipient parents.
Two parents and 148 lines were grown in the Zeng-
cheng Experimental Base of South China Agricultural
University (at approximately 113° east longitude and ap-
proximately 23° north latitude) in autumn of 2014, 2015,
and 2016. Two parents planted in 2017 were used for
transcriptome sequencing. A randomized complete-block
Wu et al. BMC Plant Biology          (2020) 20:117 
Page 9 of 13
design was used. Each line or parent was grown in 10
plants with 2 replicates. The length of the rows was 3 m,
and the row spacing was 70 cm. The plant spacing was 25
cm, and the density was 57,000 hm2. Crop management
and disease and insect pest control were performed as lo-
cally recommended.
Three self-pollinated ears of the two parents were
sampled and placed immediately on ice 19 days after
pollination in the field in 2017. Ten kernels were col-
lected from the middle of each ear. The upper abgerm-
inal part of the pericarp was stripped on ice and stored
in liquid nitrogen for analysis by scanning electron
microscopy.
Phenotypic data collection
Frozen section method
Ten whole kernels from each ear were placed on ice. Each
kernel was cut off approximately 3 mm at the top with
bald tweezers and then transferred into liquid nitrogen for
3 s. Frozen samples were used for the preparation of tissue
slices. We took cross-sections from the dorsal embryo
with a thickness of approximately 100 μm. The process
was completed before thawing to ensure that the pericarp
did not fall off. The slices were then quickly placed on the
slide. After thawing, KI-I2 reagent was added for 3 s, and
the dye was then washed off with water after covering the
coverslip. The pericarp thickness of each kernel was mea-
sured by micrometer. The average value of pericarp thick-
ness from three ears of each genotype was regarded as the
observed value of the pericarp thickness and used for sub-
sequent analysis [2, 41].
Phenotypic data analysis
The phenotypic data were analyzed using SPSS version 19
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). These variance components
of the genotype and environment in each year were esti-
mated by using the linear mixed model: yil = μ + rl + fi + εil,
and these variance components of the genotype and envir-
onment in 3 years were estimated by using the following
mixed model: yijl = μ + ej + rl(j) + fi + (fe)ij + εijl,where μ is
the grand mean of pericarp thickness, fi is the genetic ef-
fect of the ith line, rl is the effect of replications, εil is the
residual error, ej is the environmental effect of the jth en-
vironment, (fe)ij is the interaction effect between genetic
and environmental effects, rl(j) is effect of replications
within environments, and εijl is the residual error [42].
The PROC MIXED procedure in SAS software (Release
9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used to get the variance
components of all pericarp thickness traits.
The broad sense heritability (h2) in each year was esti-
mated using the following formula: h2 ¼ σ2
g=ðσ2
g þ σ2
z=rÞ,
and the h2
b in cross-years was estimated using the follow-
ing formula: h2
b ¼ σ2
g=ðσ2
g þ σ2
ge=e þ σ2
z=reÞ; where σg
2 is
the genetic variance, σz
2 is the residual error, and r is the
number of replications, σge
2 is the interaction of geno-
type with environment, e and r represent the number of
environments and replications in each environment [42].
Library construction and high-throughput sequencing
Genomic DNA was extracted from the two parents and
the BC4F3 population using a cetyl trimethylammonium
bromide (CTAB) protocol [43]. Illumina HiSeq™2500 se-
quencing was used for DNA sequencing. The Hpy166II
endonuclease was chosen to digest the genomic DNA
after profiling the restriction endonuclease sites on the
reference genome. Details of the SLAF-seq strategy and li-
brary construction were described previously [13].
Grouping and genotyping of sequence data
Specific length amplified fragment (SLAF) markers were
identified and genotyped following procedures described by
Sun et al. [13] and Zhang et al. [44]. The remaining reads
were mapped to the reference genome using BWA software
after filtering out the low-quality reads [45]. Sequences that
had greater than 95% similarity were defined as the same
SLAFs. All polymorphic SLAF markers that were consistent
with parents and offspring were genotyped.
All SLAF markers were filtered four times, and the
quality was assessed as described by Sun et al. [13]. In
brief, markers with fewer than 3 SNPs and an average
sequencing depth higher than 3 were treated as high-
quality SLAF markers. These markers were used to con-
struct high-density genetic maps.
Linkage map construction
The imputation of missing genotypes was performed
using the K-nearest neighbour algorithm based on the
two parents and the BC4F3 population [46]. A linkage
map was constructed according to the procedure de-
scribed by Zhang et al. [44]. In detail, the SLAF markers
in the linkage groups were ordered using the High Map
Strategy [47] and SMOOTH strategy [48]. Multipoint
method of maximum likelihood was used to add these
skewed markers into the linkage map [49]. The genetic
distance between the adjacent markers was estimated by
kosambi mapping function [50].
QTL analysis
QTL mapping was carried out by the composite interval
mapping method in QTLNetwork v2.1 software for a
pericarp thickness of three years and an average of three
years [51]. 1000 permutations with the mapping step of
1.0 cM was applied to calculate the LOD threshold. By
default, a 10 cM window with background marker set to
5, and a genome-wide significance level of P < 0.05 [52].
QTLs with the LOD score > 2.0 were considered as sug-
gestive QTLs [14]. Moreover, the mode of QTL action
Wu et al. BMC Plant Biology          (2020) 20:117 
Page 10 of 13
was determined according to the criteria proposed by
Stuber et al. [53]. The QTL is named by q and abbrevi-
ated by traits. In addition, the chromosome number of
the QTL and multiple QTLs on the same chromosome
are designated by 1, 2, 3, and so on. The QTL names in
this paper are expressed in italics; for example, qpt1–3
indicates the third QTL on chromosome 1 detected in
the controlled pericarp thickness population.
Transcriptome analysis
Total RNA was isolated from the pericarps (19th DAP)
using the Plant Total RNA Purification Kit (TR02–150,
GeneMarkbio). The extracted RNA was run in a 1%
agarose gel to assess the integrity of the RNA. Briefly,
poly-A RNA-containing mRNA was enriched using
poly-Toligo-attached magnetic beads and fragmented.
Second-strand cDNA was synthesized using random
hexamer primers and then purified, end-repaired, poly-A
tailed, and adaptor-ligated. The cDNA libraries were se-
quenced with a read length of 100 bp (paired-end) using
the Illumina HiSeq 2000 System at Biomarker Technolo-
gies (Beijing, China). The experiment was performed
with three biological replicates.
Quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR
Quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) was car-
ried out to validate the RNA-seq results. The total RNA
from each sample was extracted and reverse transcribed
into single-stranded cDNA using a FastQuant RT Kit
(Takara) including gDNase according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Gene expression was determined by qRT-PCR
analysis using the CFX96 Real-Time System (Bio-Rad). All
reactions were performed in 20-μL volumes consisting of
1 μl cDNA, 0.3 μM of each gene-specific primer and the
SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix Kit (Bio-Rad). qRT-PCR was
conducted with the following protocol: 94 °C for 1 min
followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 55 °C for 10 s, and
72 °C for 15 s. The relative transcriptional levels were calcu-
lated using the 2−△△CT method [54] with actin as a house-
keeping gene. The specific primers were designed using
NCBI primer BLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/
primer-blast/). The primer sequences for each gene are
listed in Additional file 8 (Table S6).
