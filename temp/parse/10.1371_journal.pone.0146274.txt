Abstract
Mammals developed antioxidant systems to defend against oxidative damage in their daily
life. Enzymatic antioxidants and low molecular weight antioxidants (LMWAs) constitute
major parts of the antioxidant systems. Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2,
encoded by the Nrf2 gene) is a central transcriptional regulator, regulating transcription, of
many antioxidant enzymes. Frugivorous bats eat large amounts of fruits that contain high
levels of LMWAs such as vitamin C, thus, a reliance on LMWAs might greatly reduce the
need for antioxidant enzymes in comparison to insectivorous bats. Therefore, it is possible
that frugivorous bats have a reduced need for Nrf2 function due to their substantial intake of
diet-antioxidants. To test whether the Nrf2 gene has undergone relaxed evolution in fruit-
eating bats, we obtained Nrf2 sequences from 16 species of bats, including four Old World
fruit bats (Pteropodidae) and one New World fruit bat (Phyllostomidae). Our molecular evo-
lutionary analyses revealed changes in the selection pressure acting on Nrf2 gene and
identified seven specific amino acid substitutions that occurred on the ancestral lineage
leading to Old World fruit bats. Biochemical experiments were conducted to examine Nrf2 in
Old World fruit bats and showed that the amount of catalase, which is regulated by Nrf2,
was significantly lower in the brain, heart and liver of Old World fruit bats despite higher lev-
els of Nrf2 protein in Old World fruit bats. Computational predictions suggest that three of
these seven amino acid replacements might be deleterious to Nrf2 function. Therefore, the
results suggest that Nrf2 gene might have experienced relaxed constraint in Old World fruit
bats, however, we cannot rule out the possibility of positive selection. Our study provides
the first data on the molecular adaptation of Nrf2 gene in frugivorous bats in compensation
to the increased levels of LWMAs from their fruit-diet.

Introduction
Free radicals, including reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS), are continuously
produced by aerobic metabolism and from external exposure. Under normal physiological con-
ditions, the major endogenous source of ROS is proton leakage from the electron transport
chain (ETCs) in the mitochondria [1, 2]. Escaped protons react with oxygen, with approxi-
mately 1–2% of the oxygen consumed by cell being diverted to generate hydrogen peroxide [3]
and superoxide (O2
-) [1], which are the primary ROS found in living cells. These reactive spe-
cies can attack DNA, protein and other macromolecules leading to oxidative damage [4]. The
uncontrolled generation of reactive species results in oxidative stress and is harmful to organ-
isms as it causes pathological changes.
Organisms have developed antioxidant defense systems to protect against oxidative damage
and maintain cellular homeostasis. Antioxidant defense systems consist of functionally con-
nected groups of enzymes and low molecular weight antioxidants (LMWAs) [4]. Antioxidant
enzymes, for example catalase and superoxide dismutase, are endogenously produced and are
highly efficient at scavenging ROS. Transcription of genes for these enzymes is regulated by
nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2), a member of the cap ‘n’ collar (CNC) sub-
family of basic region leucine zipper (bZip) transcription factors [5]. Nrf2 regulates the tran-
scription of targeted genes via cis-acting enhancer elements known as the antioxidant response
elements (AREs), located in the promoter regions, with the core sequence of the ARE being 5’-
RTGAYNNNGCR-3’ [6, 7]. Nrf2 is ubiquitously expressed in tissues and is the main regulator
of the redox response. Nrf2 knockout mice display substantially increased susceptibility to oxi-
dative stress [8], and exhibit large decreases in the expression of catalase [9] and NQO1 [10].
On the other hand, some reactive species scavengers are not enzymes, but instead are LMWAs.
LMWAs are a group of compounds that originate from endogenous sources or exogenously
from diet, which are capable of eliminating reactive species in direct or indirect ways [4, 11].
Examples of diet-derived antioxidants are vitamins A, C and E and the carotenoids, which play
major roles in mitigating the negative effects of reactive species [11].
Bats (order: Chiroptera) are one of the most widespread and diversified mammalian groups
with over 1100 species in the world [12]. Like other mammals, bats also possess antioxidant
defense systems to protect against damage caused by ROS. Numerous studies in bats have
linked oxidative stress with longevity, with lower levels of radicals associated with longer life
[13–15]. Antioxidants might have a role in this process, as bats are exceptional long-lived, com-
pared with nonflying mammals of similar size and basal metabolic rate [15, 16]. Bats exhibit a
great diversity in food habits including frugivory, nectarivory, insectivory, piscivory, carnivory
and sanguivory [17, 18]. This diversity in food habits is considered to have evolved indepen-
dently several times from insectivorous bat ancestors [19]. Old World fruit bats (OWFBs; Sub-
order: Yinpterochiroptera; Family: Pteropodidae) and New World fruit bats (NWFBs;
Suborder: Yangochiroptera; Family: Phyllostomidae) evolved fruit and nectar-eating habits
independently. However, some New World fruit bats switch their food preference to insects
when fruits are less abundant [20]. Megabats, especially Old World fruit bats, feed only upon
plants, fruits, and leaves. Marshall reported that nearly 188 kinds of plant genera are the food
source of megabats, with 144 of them being fruits [21]. Bats belonging to Pteropodidae can
ingest up to 2.5 times their body mass in fruit per night [22]. Fruits contain large amounts of
vitamin C, α-tocopherol and β-carotene, molecules that are dietary antioxidants and play
important roles in antioxidant systems [23]. It was also reported that the daily intake of fruits
by Artibeus jamaicensis is more than 50% of its body weight and contained nearly 45mg ascor-
bate [24]. The GSH and α-tocopherol contents of frugivorous bats have been reported to higher
than those of insectivorous bats [16]. Schneeberger et al. argued that LWMAs-rich diets might

enable frugivorous bats to more efficiently remove pro-oxidants [25]. Danilo et al. studied anti-
oxidative enzymes in five bats species, finding that the activities of catalase and SODs in frugiv-
orous bats were lower than in insectivorous bats [16]. These results suggest that frugivorous
bats have a lower reliance on antioxidative enzymes, as their decreased levels of enzymatic anti-
oxidant systems are balanced through an increased dietary input of LMWAs. The finding of a
lower levels of antioxidative enzymes in frugivorous bats [21], lead us to speculate that Nrf2,
which is the central regulator of antioxidant enzyme gene transcription, may have undergone
relaxed evolution in these bats.
To test our hypothesis, we sequenced the coding region of the Nrf2 gene from 11 species of
bats, which were then combined with the sequences from 5 other bat species databases. The
molecular evolution of these sequences was then studied in bats and other mammals. To vali-
date the results from our molecular evolutionary analyses, we investigated the expression levels
of Nrf2 protein and a downstream antioxidant enzyme in representative species of frugivorous
and insectivorous bats. While expanding our knowledge on antioxidant adaptations in frugivo-
rous and insectivorous bats, our study might also provide additional insight into understanding
the longevity of bats.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
The Animal Ethics Committee of East China Normal University approved all procedures,
including the collection of bats species and tissues (ID No: AR2012/03001). The capture of bats
were permitted by the local Protection and Research Center and the locations of all samples are
listed in S1 Table. None of the bat species used in this study are considered endangered. Ani-
mals used in this study were sacrificed by rapid decapitation after capture and all efforts were
made to minimize potential pain and suffering.
Animal and Tissue Collections
Details and capture locations of the bat species used in molecular cloning are listed in S1 Table.
Neotropical bats used for molecular cloning were captured in Mexico during April, 2010, for a
previous study [26]. Four representative bat species was adopted in the biochemical experi-
ments, two insectivorous bats: Myotis ricketti (Suborder: Yangochiroptera), Rhinolophus ferru-
mequinum (Suborder: Yinpterochiroptera), and two frugivorous bats: Rousettus leschenaultia
and Cynopterus sphinx (Old World fruit bats). Three male individuals from these of the four
bats species were captured from different locations in China: Myotis ricketti from Fangshan
Cave in Beijing (39°48'N, 115°42'E); Rhinolophus ferrumequinum from Fish Cave in Anhui
Province (30°20'N, 117°50'E); Rousettus leschenaultia from Jinlun Cave of Mashan County in
Guangxi Province (23°55'N, 108°26'E) and Cynopterus sphinx from Haikou Park in Hainan
Province (20°02'N, 110°20'E), during August to September, 2013. Bats were immediately trans-
ported to the laboratory and housed in a large cage (150 cm × 180 cm × 200 cm) until they
adapted to the new environment. For each of these species, three individuals were sacrificed by
cervical dislocation under conditions that were as similar as possible. Tissues were sampled
and immediately stored at -80°C until use.
Isolation, Amplification and Sequencing of Nrf2 Coding Sequences
Total RNA from 11 bats was isolated from brain tissue using TRizol reagent (Invitrogen) fol-
lowing the standard protocol. RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using a SuperScriptTM
ⅢReverse Transcriptase Kit (Invitrogen). PCR reactions were conducted with primers

designed within the coding region of published Nrf2 cDNA sequences (S2 Table). Resulting
PCR products were separated using a 1.5% agarose gel and purified with a Gel Extraction Kit
(Qiagen), and then ligated into pGEM-T Easy vectors (Promega), with positive clones
sequenced on an ABI sequencer (Applied Biosystems).
Taxonomic Coverage
We sequenced most of the coding region of Nrf2 gene from 11 bats species representing eight
of the 17 chiropteran families. In suborder Yinpterochiropetra, we included two Old World
fruit bats from family Pteropodidae (Cynopterus sphinx, Rousettus leschenaultia); we also
included four insectivorous bats from the Yinpterochiropetra suborder: Rhinolophus pusillus
(Rhinolophidae), Hipposideros pratti (Hipposideridae) and Megaderma lyra and Megaderma
spasma (Megadermatidae). From the suborder Yangochiroptera, we included one New World
fruit bat Artibeus jamaicensis (Phyllostomidae) and four insectivorous bats from three families:
Pteronotus parnelli (Mormoopidea), Myotis ricketti, Pipistrellus abramus (Vespertilionidae)
and Taphozous melanopogon (Emballonuridae). Nrf2 genes from five additional species were
retrieved from GeneBank, and included Pteropus vampyrus and Pteropus alecto (Pteropodi-
dae), Myotis brandtii, Myotis lucifugus and Myotis davidii (Vespertilionidae). All new
sequences were deposited into GeneBank with accession numbers KT345715-KT345725.
Nrf2 sequences from five other mammal species were obtained from the Ensembl Database:
Homo sapiens (ENSG00000116044), Pan troglodytes (ENSPTRG00000012677), Canis famil-
iaris (ENSCAFG00000013506), Bos taurus (ENSBTAG00000019255), and Ictidomys tridecem-
lineatus (ENSSTOG00000000313). Details on all bats species and their corresponding Nrf2
gene accession numbers are listed in S1 Table.
Phylogenetic Reconstruction
Nrf2 coding sequences from 16 bats and 5 other mammals were aligned using CLUSTAL W
implemented in MEGA 6 with default setting [27]. First, we examined whether there was any
evidence for recombination within our dataset, as recombination would have adverse effects on
the power and accuracy of phylogenetic reconstruction and molecular evolutionary analyses
[28]. We used GARD [29](from the Hyphy/Datamonkey web server [30]) with β–Γ rate varia-
tion and three and four rate classes to detect evidence of recombination breakpoints and test
their statistical significance. The program jModelTest 0.1 [31] was used to evaluate the best
nucleotide substitution model. A Bayesian phylogenetic tree was reconstructed based on the
aligned nucleotide sequences using MrBayes 3.1.2 [32] with the GTR+G nucleotide substitu-
tion model, as selected by jModelTest 0.1. For the Bayesian analysis, ten million generations
was set for the Markov chain, with the first two million discarded as burn in. The standard
deviations of the split frequencies were stable below 0.01 after two million generations of
MCMC. The MCMC was run in default setting of MrBayes 3.1.2. Datasets supporting the
results are available in the Dryad digital repository, http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.kh186
(DOI:10.5061/dryad.kh186).
Reconstruction of Ancestral Characters and Molecular Evolutionary
Analyses
Nrf2 coding sequence from 21 species used in this study were aligned by CLUSTAL W imple-
mented in MEGA 6 [27] and checked for accuracy by eye. The alignment was then translated
into amino acid sequences. In the process of sequence alignment, we identified seven amino
acid changes that occurred in the Old World fruit bats. To trace the ancestral states for these
lineage-specific amino acid changes, we assessed these substitutions using the maximum

parsimony method with Mesquite 2.74 [33], the parameters set as defaults. For ancestral state
reconstruction and selection tests, we used the phylogenetic tree topology based on the
accepted species relationships [34–36].
To test the selective pressure on Nrf2 genes in bat lineages, we estimated the rates of nonsy-
nonymous (dN) and synonymous substitutions (dS) using CODEML from the PAML 4 pack-
age [37]. As shown in Fig 1B, we labeled four branches for testing: A, ancestral branch of Old
World fruit bats; B, ancestral branch of insectivorous bats in suborders Yinpterochiroptera; C,
ancestral branch of Yangochiroptera; and D, ancestral branch of New World fruit bats. We
first performed the two-ratio model test, which assumes the focal lineage(s) have a different ω
value (dN/dS) compared with other lineages. First, we tested the ancestral lineage leading to
Old World fruit bats (branch A) and the branch leading to New World fruit bats (branch D).
In addition, to compare the evolutionary pattern of the Nrf2 gene between frugivorous bats
and insectivorous bats, separate two-ratio model tests were conducted with the ancestral
branches for insectivorous bats in suborders Yinpterochiroptera (branch B) and Yangochirop-
tera (branch C). The one-ratio model served as the null hypothesis for all comparisons, which
assumes the ω value is equal among all branches.
To further test the selection pressure on the amino acid sites of Nrf2 genes, we carried the
branch-site model A combined with Bayes empirical Bayes (BEB) estimation [38]. The focal
branches in these tests were the ancestors of Old World fruit bats (branch A), New World fruit
bat (branch D), and insectivorous bats in the suborders Yinpterochiroptera (branch B) and
Yangochiroptera (branch C). The remaining branches were set as background. Four site classes
of codons are assumed (class 0, class 1, class 2a, and class 2b), class 0 and class 1 codons are
assumed to evolve under purifying selection (0 < ω0 < 1) and neutral selection (ω1 = 1),
respectively. Class 2a and class 2b evolve under purifying selection and neutral selection on the
background, respectively, while codons in these classes are combined together, as class 2, and
assumed to evolve under positive selection (ω2 > 1) on the foreground lineage. We applied
test1 and test2 of branch-site model A to these four branches (A, B, C, and D), in which
branch-site model A as the alternative hypothesis. In test1, the null hypothesis is the M1a
model (Nearly neutral), which allowed two site classes (0 < ω0 < 1 and ω1 = 1). However, in
test2, the modified branch-site model A with ω2 fixed as 1 was the null hypothesis. To investi-
gate the distribution of selection pressure on sites along the Nrf2 protein sequence, we

performed test2 of branch-site model A to calculate the ω value of each amino acid in the
ancestral branches leading to Old World fruit bats (branch A), insectivorous bats of suborders
Yinpterochiroptera (branch B) and Yangochiroptera (branch C), and the only species of New
World fruit bat (Artibeus lituratus) (branch D). The statistic 2Δℓ(twice the log likelihood dif-
ference between the null and alternative hypothesis models) was compared through likelihood
ratio tests (LRTs) with the Chi-square test in PAML. Finally, to gain more information on the
seven amino acid substitutions in Old World fruit bats, we used different computational meth-
ods to predict the biological impact of these mutations on protein function. Protein Variation
Effect Analyzer (PROVEAN) [39] and Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT) program [40]
were used to determine whether a given substitution is deleterious to protein function based on
comparison with homologous amino acid sequences. The threshold was set as -1.5 in PRO-
VEAN and 0.05 in the SIFT program.
Western Blot Validation
Expression levels of Nrf2 protein and the downstream enzyme catalase (CAT) were investi-
gated, and compared, between frugivorous and insectivorous bats. Proteins from brain, heart,
and liver were extracted from four representative bat species: Myotis ricketti (yangochiropteran
insectivorous bats), Rhinolophus ferrumequinum (yinpterochiropteran insectivorous bats) and
Cynopterus sphinx, and Rousettus leschenaultia (frugivorous bats from Old World fruit bats).
Three individuals were examined for each species. Proteins from rat tissues were used as a posi-
tive loading control. Brain, heart, and liver tissues were homogenized using Precellys 24 grinder
(Bertin technologies, France) with lysis buffer (10% Glycerol, 2% SDS, 1.25% 2-beta-mercap-
toethanol, 25 mM Tris–HCl, pH 6.8) and then heated at 100°C for 10min after a quick spin.
The resulting homogenates were centrifuged at 12000 xg at 4°C for 10 min and supernatants
were collected. The protein content of each sample was determined utilizing the Quick Start
Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, USA). Proteins in each sample (40 μg/lane) were sepa-
rated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to 0.2 μm PVDF membranes (Roche, Switzerland).
The PVDF membranes were blocked in blocking solution (5% skim milk and 1% BSA) at 4°C
for 12 hours and then reacted with primary antibodies including anti-CAT (1:500) and anti-
Nrf2 (1:500). Anti-CAT (21260-1-AP) and anti-Nrf2 (sc-722) were purchased from Protein-
tech Group, Inc. and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., respectively. Antibodies were selected
based on the ability to combine with the conserved epitopes of proteins in bats and rats. After
washing with TBST, PVDF membranes were incubated with secondary antibody and then
visualized using ImmobilonTM Western Chemiluminescence HRP substrate kit (Millipore,
USA). Images were captured with the ImageQuantTM LAS 4000 (GE healthcare Life Science,
USA) and bands were quantified with ImageQuantTM TL software (version 7.0). Reversible
ponceau staining of the membranes were conducted to examine the relative amount of proteins
in each lane [41]. The intensity of each band was normalized to the corresponding ponceau
stained protein band. Results are shown as mean ± SD and the statistical significance of the dif-
ference in CAT and Nrf2 levels among the different species was determined by one-way
ANOVA with post hoc Holm-Sidak tests. P value < 0.05 were considered statistic significant.
Results
Our final Nrf2 sequence dataset contained 21 taxa, including four Old World fruit bats (family
Pteropodidae), one New World fruit bat (family Phyllostomidae), eleven insectivorous bats
and five other mammals. The alignment of the Nrf2 sequences spanned 1710 nucleotides (570
amino acids), representing 94.2% of the complete coding region. No insertions, deletions or
stop codons, and no evidence for recombination breakpoints were detected in our dataset.

Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction of the Nrf2 nucleotide sequences revealed a tree
where the main groupings were in agreement with the accepted mammalian species tree (Fig
1). The four Old Word fruit bats (P. vampyrus, P. alecto, C. sphinx, and R. leschenaultii)
grouped with species of the family Rhinolophidae (R. pusillus), Hipposideridae (H. pratti) and
Megadermatidae (M. lyra and M. spasma) to comprise suborder Yinpterochiroptera [Bayesian
posterior probability (BPP) = 0.48]. The remaining bat species grouped together to comprise
the suborder Yangochiroptera (BPP = 1.00).
From the Nrf2 protein sequence alignment, we identified seven amino acid substitutions
(100D, 133D, 205F, 224G, 279I, 350R and 424S) shared by all Old World fruit bat species,
while all other species, including insectivorous bats and outgroups, shared a different amino
acid residue at these locations (Fig 1B). No similar set of amino acid changes was observed in
the New World fruit bat. To trace the evolutionary history of these sites, we used Mesquite 2.74
to reconstruct the ancestral amino acid sequences. The results of the ancestral state reconstruc-
tion showed that seven specific amino acid replacements (A100D, N133D, D205F, D224G,
T279I, T350R and N424S) occurred on the ancestral branch leading to Old World fruit bats
(S1 Fig), and these seven amino acid substitutions were specific to this lineage.
To investigate changes in the selection pressure acting on the Nrf2 gene in frugivorous and
insectivorous bats, several two-ratio model tests were carried out on the four branches labeled
A, B, C, and D in Fig 1B, which represent the ancestral branches of Old World fruit bats, insec-
tivorous bats in suborders Yinpterochiroptera, ancestral branch of Yangochiroptera and New
World fruit bat, respectively. The results of the two-ratio tests are shown in Table 1. However,
a comparison of alternative hypotheses with the null hypothesis indicates that the two-ratio
models for branches A, B, C, and D do not fit the data better than the one-ratio model.
To further investigate the distribution of selection pressures on sites along the Nrf2
sequence, we performed test2 of branch-site model A to calculate the ω values for each amino
acid on the ancestral branches leading to the Old World fruit bats (branch A), the insectivorous
bats of suborder Yinpterochiroptera (branch B), bats of suborder Yangochiroptera (branch C)
and the only species of New World fruit bat in our study (Artibeus lituratus) (branch D).
Results show that the ω values for amino acid sites on the ancestral branch for Old World fruit
bats are higher than that for the other branches (Fig 2). Specifically, the selection pressure for
the seven amino acid replacement sites (A100D, N133D, D205F, D224G, T279I, T350R and
N424S) were significantly elevated on the ancestral branch leading to Old World fruit bats
(branch A) (Fig 2). Moreover, as shown in Table 2, branch-site model A for the ancestral
branch of Old World fruit bats did not fit the data better than the branch-site null model which
fixed ω2 as 1 (2Δℓ= 1.88, df = 1, P = 0.17; test2), however, branch-site model A for the ancestral
branch of Old World fruit bats did fit the data better than M1a model (2Δℓ= 7.72, df = 2,

P = 0.021; test1) (details for test1 and test2 of the branch-site model A can be found in the
Materials and Methods Section). Thus, we are unable to reject the possibility of relaxed selec-
tion since test1 of branch-site model A cannot distinguish relaxed constraints from positive
selection [42]. No evidence for positively selected sites was detected on the branch leading to
New World fruit bats (branch D), as the null model cannot be rejected by either test1 or test2
(Table 2). Similar conclusions were also found for the ancestral branches leading to the insec-
tivorous bats of suborder Yinpterochiroptera (branch B) and suborder Yangochiroptera
(branch C) (Table 2).
To test the potential influence of the seven amino acid substitutions on the function of Nrf2
protein in Old World fruit bats, we mapped these sites to the predicted secondary structure of
the Nrf2 protein established in previous studies (Fig 3) [43, 44]. Nrf2 belongs to the CNC fam-
ily of transcription factors and contains seven functional Neh domains, namely, Neh1 to Neh7
[43, 44]. Four of the seven amino acid replacements that occurred in Old World fruit bats
locate to Neh domain (Fig 3). The N133D replacement occurs within the Neh4 domain,
D224G and T279I are located in the Neh7 domain and T350R is located in Neh6 domain (Fig
3). The remaining three replacements (A100D, D205F, and N424S) are located in sequences
between Neh domains in Nrf2 that are not associated with specific functions. To further inves-
tigate whether the seven amino acid substitutions potentially affect protein function, we pre-
dicted the functional consequences of the substitutions using PROVEAN software and the
SIFT program. PROVEAN predicts that three of the seven replacements (D205F, T279I and
T350R) were deleterious to Nrf2 protein function (score threshold is -1.3), with the remaining
four changes predicted as neutral (Table 3). SIFT suggested that two of the seven replacements
(D205F and T350R) were predicted to affect protein function (threshold is 0.05) (Table 3).
These results suggest that replacements D205F and T350R are most likely damaging, as they
were predicted to be deleterious by both programs.
To further investigate, and compare, the functional effects of the amino acid replacements
between Old World fruit bats and insectivorous bats, we first examined the amount of Nrf2
protein in two representative species of Old World fruit bats (C. sphinx, R. leschenaultia) and
two insectivorous bats (M. ricketti from suborder Yangochiroptera; R. ferrumequinum from
Yinpterochiroptera) and the omnivorous rat as the positive loading control. Brain, heart and
liver tissue from each species were examined since these three organs are the most vulnerable

nificant higher than in the two insectivorous bats (P < 0.05, one way ANOVA, Holm-Sidak
post hoc test) (Fig 4A). However, no significant difference was found among C. sphinx, M. rick-
etti and R. ferrumequinum. In the heart, the amount of Nrf2 protein in the two Old World fruit
bats was significantly higher compared to the two insectivorous bats (P < 0.05, one way
ANOVA, Holm-Sidak post hoc test) (Fig 4A). The level of Nrf2 in the heart of C. sphinx was
higher than in R. leschenaultia, with no significant difference found between M. ricketti and R.
ferrumequinum. The same situation was observed in the liver, with significantly higher levels of
Nrf2 protein in the two Old World fruit bats compared with the two insectivorous bats
(P < 0.001, one way ANOVA, Holm-Sidak post hoc test) (Fig 4A). Moreover, higher levels of
Nrf2 protein were found in the livers of C. sphinx and R. ferrumequinum in comparison with
R. leschenaultia and M. ricketti, respectively (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05 in two comparisons, one
way ANOVA, Holm-Sidak post hoc test) (Fig 4A).
To determine whether the elevated levels of Nrf2 protein in the three tissues of the Old
World fruit bats resulted in enhanced transcriptional function, we conducted Western blot
assays to examine the expression of a down-stream enzyme CAT, which is regulated by Nrf2
[48]. However, in contrast to expectations based on the elevated levels of Nrf2, our results
showed that the amount of CAT in the brain, heart and liver of the two Old World fruit bats
were remarkably lower than in the two insectivorous bats (Fig 4B). In the three tissues from the
insectivorous bats, CAT levels were significantly higher in M. ricketti compared to R. ferrume-
quinum (P < 0.001, one way ANOVA, Holm-Sidak post hoc test) (Fig 4B). The level of Nrf2 in
the liver of R. leschenaultia was significantly higher than in C. sphinx (P < 0.001, one way

Neh2 domain (residue 27–82) is a redox-sensitive regulatory domain that binds with the repressor Keap1,
and also contains one of the three nuclear localization sequences (NLS: residue 42–53, 494–511 and 587–
593). Neh3 (residue 562–605), Neh4 (residue 112–134) and Neh5 (residue 183–201) domains are involved
in Nrf2 transactivation activity. Neh6 domain (residue 338–388) is involved in Nrf2 stability. Neh7 domain
(residue 209–316) is involved in interactions with RXRα and functions as a transcriptional repressor.

ANOVA, Holm-Sidak post hoc test) (Fig 4B). These results suggest that despite higher levels of
Nrf2 protein in Old World fruit bats, the downstream antioxidant enzyme CAT was signifi-
cantly lower in the three tissues than in insectivorous bats suggesting that the Old World fruit
bat Nrf2 sequence have lower transcriptional activity.
Discussion
In this study, we examined the evolutionary history of the Nrf2 gene, a central transcriptional
regulator of antioxidant enzymes in mammals. Antioxidant enzymes are an important part of
the antioxidant defense system, together with low molecular weight antioxidants (LMWAs)
[4]. As the daily diet of frugivorous bats contains fruits that are high in LWMAs such as vita-
mins C and E [23, 24], the abundance of LMWAs might lead to a reduced need for enzymatic
antioxidants for free radical scavenging compared with insectivorous bats. Nrf2, as the gene
encoding a transcriptional regulator of antioxidant enzyme genes, thus might have experienced
relaxed constraint in the frugivorous bats. Comparing Nrf2 sequences among frugivorous and
insectivorous bats provides the first data on the molecular adaptation of the Nrf2 gene in fru-
givorous bats. Phylogenetic reconstruction analyses showed that the Nrf2 gene tree is consis-
tent with the accepted species tree (Fig 1) and the dN/dS ratio calculated by PAML on each
branch was quite low (data not shown), results indicating that the Nrf2 sequences are evolving
conservatively under purifying selection.
Interestingly, alignment of the 21 Nrf2 protein sequences in our dataset identified seven
amino acid replacements that were specifically found exclusively in the four Old World fruit
bat species (Fig 1B). Ancestral state reconstruction using Mesquite 2.74 showed that all seven
amino acid changes occurred precisely on the ancestral branch leading to Old World fruit bats
(S1 Fig). Although the results of test1 in branch-site model A for Old World fruit bats revealed
that the codons for the seven amino acid replacements had elevated ω value, we cannot distin-
guish whether these elevated ω values are the result of relaxed selection or positive selection
acting on Nrf2 since test1 was unable to distinguish relaxed constraints from positive selection
[42]. In addition, although the ω values for amino acid sites on the ancestral branch for Old
World fruit bats are higher than for other branches, the ω value for the ancestral branch leading
to Old World fruit bats was 0.387 (data not shown), which is far below the standard for positive
selection (ω >> 1). The results of an explicit test for positive selection (test2) was negative,
which indicates that there is no strict evidence for positive selection on the Nrf2 sequences on
Fig 4. The levels of Nrf2 protein and catalase (CAT) in the brain, heart and liver of four bats species.

the ancestral branch for Old World fruit bats (Table 2). Based on the fact that the frugivorous
bats get an abundance of LWMAs from their daily diets, their demands for enzymatic antioxi-
dants, which are regulated by Nrf2, should be reduced. We hypothesize that the seven amino
acid replacements observed in the Old World fruit bat Nrf2 sequences have a functional conse-
quence. To confirm this hypothesis, we performed a biochemical experiment to indirectly
investigate the functional activity of Nrf2 by examining the level of the enzyme catalase (CAT),
which is a downstream transcriptionally regulated target of Nrf2 [48].
We examined the amount of CAT in three tissues, brain, heart and liver, as these tissues are
most vulnerable to oxidative stress [45–47]. Our results showed that CAT level was signifi-
cantly lower in the brain, heart and liver of the two Old World fruit bats compared to the two
insectivorous bats (Fig 4B). It might be assumed that the lower levels of CAT are a consequence
of reduced Nrf2 expression in Old World fruit bats, however, this possibility can be ruled out
as our biochemical results show that Nrf2 protein levels are significantly higher in the heart
and liver of the two Old World fruit bats compared with the two insectivorous bats (Fig 4A).
CAT is a major enzymatic antioxidant in aerobic organisms that decomposes hydrogen perox-
ide to prevent the generation of hydroxyl radical [49], the highly mobile and chemically most
reactive species of activated oxygen [50]. Several studies have suggested that Nrf2 knockout
mice are extremely susceptible to oxidative damage and have downregulated expression of
CAT [9, 51]. Moreover, Cat deficient mice were vulnerable to impairment of brain mitochon-
dria [49]. Thus, the expression level of CAT should represent some of the functions of the tran-
scription factor Nrf2. Combining the results of our molecular evolutionary analysis and
biochemical assays, the changes in selection pressure observed at these seven amino acid sites
likely are the main cause of the functional change in Nrf2 seen in Old Word fruit bats.
Upregulated Nrf2 expression in these three tissues of Old World fruit bats could also be
explained as a compensatory adaptation of the organisms. If the seven amino acid replace-
ments seen in the Old World fruit bat sequences affect Nrf2 protein function, then the
increased levels of Nrf2 protein might represent an attempt to compensate for their normal
functions [52]. However, although the level of Nrf2 in Old World fruit bats is upregulated, the
level of the downstream enzyme CAT is still markedly lower than in insectivorous bats (Fig 4),
suggests that upregulation did not completely attenuate the Nrf2 function in Old World fruit
bats.
Although the results of the two-ratio test on the ancestral branch leading to Old World fruit
bats did not fit the data better than the one-ratio test, we are unable to conclude that Nrf2 has
undergone purifying selection, as the ω value calculated by the branch model is the average of
nonsynonymous and synonymous rates over all sites in the protein sequence and over all evo-
lutionary history [53–55]. In order to maintain the function of a protein, most amino acid sites
are highly conserved, which results in the signal of elevated ω values at specific sites being over-
whelmed by the ubiquitous purifying selection occurring at the vast majority of other sites
[54]. Alignment of the protein sequences in our dataset indicates that most amino acid sites in
the Nrf2 protein are conserved throughout mammals, thus, the two-ratio test for the ancestral
branch of Old World fruit bats was unable to reject the possibility of one-ratio test even when
the seven amino acid replacements, with elevated ω values, occurred in Old World fruit bats
(Tables 1 and 2).
To further investigate the potential impact of the seven amino acid substitutions on the
function of Nrf2 protein in Old World fruit bats, we mapped these substitutions to the second-
ary structure of the Nrf2 protein (Fig 3) [43, 44]. Nrf2 belongs to the CNC family of transcrip-
tion factors and contains seven functional Neh domains [43, 44]. Three of the seven amino
acid substitutions (D205F, T279I and T350R) in Old World fruit bats are predicted deleterious
to Nrf2 function by PROVEAN, with two of these substitutions (D205F and T350R) predicted

to be deleterious by the SIFT program (Table 3). The D205F replacement is not located in any
of the seven characterized Neh domain, but this substitution is a radical change with the
charged and polar amino acid aspartic acid (D) that prefers to be exposed to aqueous environ-
ment replaced by phenylalanine (F), which prefers to bury in protein hydrophobic core [56].
This D205F replacement, thus might lead to a change in the structure of Nrf2 that impacts
function or cellular localization. The second substitution that was predicted to be deleterious
by both methods, T350G, is located in the redox-insensitive Neh6 domain, a domain that is
essential for the stability of Nrf2 [57], thus this substitution might affect this function. The
T279I replacement, which was predicted to be damaging by PROVEAN but not SIFT, is
located in the Neh7 domain of Nrf2, a domain that allows Nrf2 to interact with RXRα and to
function as a repressor of ARE-driven gene expression [44], thus could have a functional
impact. In support of this, the T279I replacement in Nrf2 is adjacent to residue 278, a residue
with a missense mutation in COSMIC database of cancer-associated mutations [58], suggesting
that changes near this site have functional consequences. Together, the results of our biochemi-
cal assessment of Nrf2 and CAT protein levels, and the predicted deleterious consequences of
some replacements in the Nrf2 sequences of Old World fruit bats, suggests that Old World
fruit bats produce more Nrf2 protein than insectivorous bats, but that high level of Nrf2 lead to
lower amounts of CAT protein (Fig 4). The data suggest that the amino acids replacements,
which occurred during the evolution of Nrf2, might have yielded an Nrf2 protein that has
reduced transcriptional activity that cannot be fully compensated by upregulation. Additional
detailed studies are needed in Old World fruit bats to provide direct evidence and understand
the consequences of these substitutions on Nrf2 function and structure, which may yield results
that are informative for understanding human diseases.
Although New World fruit bats and Old World fruit bats have similar food habits, we did
not find evidence of similar evolutionary forces acting on the Nrf2 gene in New World fruit
bats (Table 2). None of the seven amino acid replacements observed in the Old World fruit
bats were detected in the New World fruit bat (Fig 1B). This evolutionary discrepancy between
Old World fruit bats and New World fruit bats can be explained in three ways. First, the Old
World fruit bats evolved their frugivorous diets earlier than New World fruit bats (at least 28
mya compared with nearly 20 mya) [34], therefore, New World fruit bats may still retain nor-
mal Nrf2 protein function due to their shorter period of time to accumulate sequence changes.
Second, it is possible that the retained Nrf2 function in New World fruit bats is due to their
divergence from their insectivorous ancestor in the family Phyllostomidae [59]. Third,
sequence changes may have occurred in the regulatory region of the Nrf2 gene in New World
fruit bats instead of the coding regions. It is noteworthy that several other recent molecular
evolution studies on diet-related genes in bats have also found similar evolutionary discrepan-
cies between Old and New World fruit bats [60–63]. For example, PCK1, which plays an
important role in glucose homeostasis during fasting, also has specific amino acid changes in
the Old World fruit bats but not in New World fruit bats [62]. The tat gene, which encodes
tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) that is involved in amino acid metabolism, has undergone
relaxed evolution in Old World fruit bats but not in New World fruit bats [63]. Since our
results were obtained from a single New World fruit bat of the family Phyllostomidae, more
sampling of New World fruit bats is needed to further confirm this finding.
In addition to its critical role in regulating antioxidant enzymes, Nrf2 is also involved in
many other cytoprotective pathways that are associated with the aging process [64]. Our results
suggest that Nrf2 function is attenuated in Old World fruit bats but maintained in insectivo-
rous bats. Some studies have found that frugivorous bats have shorter lifespans than insectivo-
rous bats [65, 66]. Since there is a close association between oxidative stress and longevity [13–
15], it is possible that changes in chiropteran longevity are associated with changes in the

selective constraint on Nrf2. However, further studies are needed to reveal correlations between
Nrf2 function and chiropteran longevity.
In conclusion, our molecular evolutionary study combined with biochemical characteriza-
tion shows that Nrf2 might have experienced relaxed constraint in Old World fruit bats, how-
ever, we cannot rule out the possibility of positive selection. The amino acid replacements that
occurred during the evolution of Nrf2 might have functional effects on the Nrf2 protein in Old
World fruit bats, potentially due to their LMWAs-rich diets. Our study provides evidence of
how diet habit influences metabolic evolution in mammals [67], and might also provide novel
insight and more information into understanding chiropteran longevity. Additional in-depth
studies are needed to investigate the mechanisms of how these amino acid replacements influ-
ence Nrf2 protein function in Old World fruit bats, and we speculate that additional research
will discover more genes associated with antioxidant regulation in frugivorous bats that have
experienced changes in selection pressure due to their LMWAs-rich diets.
