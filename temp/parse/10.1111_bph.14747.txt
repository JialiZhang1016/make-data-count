Abstract
The Concise Guide to PHARMACOLOGY 2019/20 is the fourth in this series of biennial publications. The Concise Guide provides concise overviews of the key properties of nearly 1800 human
drug targets with an emphasis on selective pharmacology (where available), plus links to the open access knowledgebase source of drug targets and their ligands (www.guidetopharmacology.org),
which provides more detailed views of target and ligand properties.
Although the Concise Guide represents approximately 400 pages, the material presented is substantially reduced compared
to information and links presented on the website.
It provides a permanent, citable, point-in-time record that will survive database updates.
The full contents of this section can be found at
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bph.14747. In addition to this overview, in which are identiﬁed Other protein targets which fall outside of the subsequent categorisation, there are six
areas of focus: G protein-coupled receptors, ion channels, nuclear hormone receptors, catalytic receptors, enzymes and transporters. These are presented with nomenclature guidance and summary
information on the best available pharmacological tools, alongside key references and suggestions for further reading. The landscape format of the Concise Guide is designed to facilitate comparison
of related targets from material contemporary to mid-2019, and supersedes data presented in the 2017/18, 2015/16 and 2013/14 Concise Guides and previous Guides to Receptors and Channels. It is
produced in close conjunction with the International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology Committee on Receptor Nomenclature and Drug Classiﬁcation (NC-IUPHAR), therefore, providing ofﬁcial
IUPHAR classiﬁcation and nomenclature for human drug targets, where appropriate.

Introduction
In order to allow clarity and consistency in pharmacology, there is
a need for a comprehensive organisation and presentation of the
targets of drugs. This is the philosophy of the IUPHAR/BPS Guide
to PHARMACOLOGY presented on the online free access database
(https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/).
This database is sup-
ported by the British Pharmacological Society (BPS), the Interna-
tional Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (IUPHAR), the
University of Edinburgh and previously the Wellcome Trust. Data
included in the Guide to PHARMACOLOGY are derived in large
part from interactions with the subcommittees of the Nomencla-
ture Committee of the International Union of Basic and Clinical
Pharmacology (NC-IUPHAR). A major inﬂuence on the develop-
ment of the database was Tony Harmar (1951-2014), who worked
with a passion to establish the curators as a team of highly in-
formed and informative individuals, with a focus on high-quality
data input, ensuring a suitably validated dataset. The Editors of
the Concise Guide have compiled the individual records, in con-
cert with the team of Curators, drawing on the expert knowledge
of these latter subcommittees. The tables allow an indication of
the status of the nomenclature for the group of targets listed,
usually previously published in Pharmacological Reviews.
In
the absence of an established subcommittee, advice from several
prominent, independent experts has generally been obtained to
produce an authoritative consensus on nomenclature, which at-
tempts to ﬁt in within the general guidelines from NC-IUPHAR.
This current edition, the Concise Guide to PHARMACOLOGY
2019/20, is the latest snapshot of the database in print form, fol-
lowing on from the Concise Guide to PHARMACOLOGY 2017/18.
It contains data drawn from the online database as a rapid
overview of the major pharmacological targets. Thus, there are
many fewer targets presented in the Concise Guide compared to
the online database.
The priority for inclusion in the Concise
Guide is the presence of quantitative pharmacological data for hu-
man proteins. This means that often orphan family members are
not presented in the Concise Guide, although structural informa-
tion is available on the online database. The organisation of the
data is tabular (where appropriate) with a standardised format,
where possible on a single page, intended to aid understanding
of, and comparison within, a particular target group. The Concise
Guide is intended as an initial resource, with links to additional
reviews and resources for greater depth and information. Phar-
macological and structural data focus primarily on human gene
products, wherever possible, with links to HGNC gene nomen-
clature and UniProt IDs. In a few cases, where data from human
proteins are limited, data from other species are indicated. Phar-
macological tools listed are prioritised on the basis of selectivity
and availability. That is, agents (agonists, antagonists, inhibitors,
activators, etc.) are included where they are both available (by
donation or from commercial sources, now or in the near future)
AND the most selective. The Concise Guide is divided into seven
sections, which comprise pharmacological targets of similar struc-
ture/function. These are G protein-coupled receptors, ion chan-
nels (combining previous records of ligand-gated, voltage-gated
and other ion channels), catalytic receptors, nuclear hormone re-
ceptors, enzymes, transporters and other protein targets. We hope
that the Concise Guide will provide for researchers, teachers and
students a state-of-the art source of accurate, curated information
on the background to their work that they will use in the Introduc-
tions to their Research Papers or Reviews, or in supporting their
teaching and studies. We recommend that any citations to in-
formation in the Concise Guide are presented in the following
format: Alexander SPH et al. (2019). The Concise Guide to PHAR-
MACOLOGY 2019/20: Introduction and Other Protein Targets. Br
J Pharmacol 176: S1–S20. In this overview are listed protein tar-
gets of pharmacological interest, which are not G protein-coupled
receptors, ion channels, nuclear hormone receptors, catalytic re-
ceptors, transporters or enzymes.

kDa
complement-related protein hormone adiponectin (also known
as ADIPOQ: adipocyte, C1q and collagen domain-containing pro-
tein; ACRP30, adipose most abundant gene transcript 1; apM-1;

protein:
Q15848)
originally
cloned
from
adipocytes [57]. Although sequence data suggest 7TM domains,
immunological evidence indicates that, contrary to typical 7TM
topology, the carboxyl terminus is extracellular, while the amino
terminus is intracellular [111]. Signalling through these receptors
appears to avoid G proteins; modelling based on the crystal struc-
tures of the adiponectin receptors suggested ceramidase acivity,
which would make these the ﬁrst in a new family of catalytic
receptors [98].

Blood coagulation components
Other protein targets →Blood coagulation components
Overview: Coagulation as a process is interpreted as a mechanism for reducing excessive blood loss through the generation of a gel-like clot local to the site of injury. The process involves the activation,
adhesion (see Integrins), degranulation and aggregation of platelets, as well as proteins circulating in the plasma. The coagulation cascade involves multiple proteins being converted to more active forms
from less active precursors, typically through proteolysis (see Proteases). Listed here are the components of the coagulation cascade targetted by agents in current clinical usage.

Carrier proteins
Other protein targets →Carrier proteins
Overview:
Transthyretin (TTR) is a homo-tetrameric protein
which transports thyroxine in the plasma and cerebrospinal ﬂuid
and retinol (vitamin A) in the plasma. Many disease causing mu-
tations in the protein have been reported, many of which cause
complex dissociation and protein mis-assembly and deposition of
toxic aggregates amyloid ﬁbril formation [73]. These amyloido-
genic mutants are linked to the development of pathological amy-
loidoses, including familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) [6, 16],
familial amyloid cardiomyopathy (FAC) [37], amyloidotic vitre-
ous opacities, carpal tunnel syndrome [63] and others.
In old
age, non-mutated TTR can also form pathological amyloid ﬁbrils
[108]. Pharmacological intervention to reduce or prevent TTR dis-
sociation is being pursued as a theapeutic strategy. To date one
small molecule kinetic stabilising molecule (tafamidis) has been
approved for FAP, and is being evaluated in clinical trials for other
TTR amyloidoses.

Overview:
Cluster of differentiation refers to an attempt
to catalogue systematically a series of over 300 cell-surface
proteins associated with immunotyping.
Many members of
the group have identiﬁed functions as enzymes (for example,
see CD73 ecto-5’-nucleotidase) or receptors (for example, see
CD41 integrin, alpha 2b subunit).
Many CDs are targeted for
therapeutic gain using antibodies for the treatment of prolifera-
tive disorders. A full listing of all the Clusters of Differentiation
proteins is not possible in the Guide to PHARMACOLOGY; listed
herein are selected members of the family targeted for therapeutic
gain.

Comments: The endogenous ligands for human PD-1 are programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1 aka CD274 (CD274, Q9NZQ7)) and programmed cell death 1 ligand 2 (PD-L2; PDCD1LG2). These
ligands are cell surface peptides, normally involved in immune system regulation. Expression of PD-1 by cancer cells induces immune tolerance and evasion of immune system attack. Anti-PD-1
monoclonal antibodies are used to induce immune checkpoint blockade as a therapeutic intervention in cancer, effectively re-establishing immune vigilance. Pembrolizumab was the ﬁrst anti-PD-1
antibody to be approved by the US FDA.

Fatty acid-binding proteins
Other protein targets →Fatty acid-binding proteins
Overview: Fatty acid-binding proteins are low molecular weight
(100-130 aa) chaperones for long chain fatty acids, fatty acyl CoA
esters, eicosanoids, retinols, retinoic acids and related metabolites
and are usually regarded as being responsible for allowing the
otherwise hydrophobic ligands to be mobile in aqueous media.
These binding proteins may perform functions extracellularly (e.g.
in plasma) or transport these agents; to the nucleus to interact
with nuclear receptors (principally PPARs and retinoic acid recep-
tors [82]) or for interaction with metabolic enzymes. Although se-
quence homology is limited, crystallographic studies suggest con-
served 3D structures across the group of binding proteins.

Notch receptors
Other protein targets →Notch receptors
Overview: The canonical Notch signalling pathway has four
type I transmembrane Notch receptors (Notch1-4) and ﬁve lig-
ands (DLL1, 2 and 3, and Jagged 1-2). Each member of this highly
conserved receptor family plays a unique role in cell-fate determi-
nation during embryogenesis, differentiation, tissue patterning,
proliferation and cell death [3].
As the Notch ligands are also
membrane bound, cells have to be in close proximity for receptor-
ligand interactions to occur. Cleavage of the intracellular domain
(ICD) of activated Notch receptors by γ-secretase is required for
downstream signalling and Notch-induced transcriptional modu-
lation [20, 66, 83, 109]. This is why γ-secretase inhibitors can be
used to downregulate Notch signalling and explains their anti-
cancer action.
One such small molecule is RO4929097 [54],
although development of this compound has been terminated
following an unsuccessful Phase II single agent clinical trial in
metastatic colorectal cancer [94].
Aberrant Notch signalling is implicated in a number of human
cancers [46, 68, 88, 104], with demcizumab and tarextumab iden-
tiﬁed as antibody inhibitors of ligand:receptor binding [74].

Regulators of G protein Signaling (RGS) proteins
Other protein targets →Regulators of G protein Signaling (RGS) proteins
Overview: Regulators of G protein signalling (RGS) proteins dis-
play a common RGS domain that interacts with the GTP-bound
Gα subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins, enhancing GTP hy-
drolysis by stabilising the transition state [8, 99, 100], leading
to a termination of GPCR signalling. Interactions through pro-
tein:protein interactions of many RGS proteins have been iden-
tiﬁed for targets other than heteromeric G proteins.
Sequence
analysis of the 20 RGS proteins suggests four families of RGS: RZ,
R4, R7 and R12 families. Many of these proteins have been iden-
tiﬁed to have effects other than through targetting G proteins.
Included here is RGS4 for which a number of pharmacological
inhibitors have been described.
RZ family
Other protein targets →Regulators of G protein Signaling (RGS) proteins →RZ family
Overview: The RZ family of RGS proteins is less well character-
ized than the other families [69]. It consists of RGS17 (also known
as RGSZ2), RGS19 (also known as GAIP) and RGS20 (with sev-
eral splice variants including RGSZ1 and Ret-RGS). All members
contain an N-terminal cysteine string motif [49] which is a site of
palmitoylation and could serve functions in membrane targeting,
protein stability or aid protein-protein interactions [2, 49]. How-
ever, the function in the case of RZ family RGS proteins is not
yet fully understood. Members of the RZ family of RGS proteins
are the only RGS proteins that have selective GTPase activating-
protein (GAP) activity for Gαz, a function that resulted in the
name of the family [27, 59, 105, 110]. However, the members
of the RZ family are able to also GAP Gαi/o members with varying
selectivity.

R12 family
Other protein targets →Regulators of G protein Signaling (RGS) proteins →R12 family
Overview: The R12 family consists of RGS10, 12 and 14. RGS12
and 14 are large proteins with additional domains that can par-
ticipate in protein-protein interactions and other functions. In
contrast, RGS10 is a small protein consisting of the RGS domain
and small N- and C-termini, similar to members of the R4 family.
However, sequence homology of the RGS10 RGS domain clearly
places it in the R12 family [45]. The Gαi/o-Loco (GoLoco) motif in
RGS12 and 14 has GDI activity (for Guanine nucleotide Dissocia-
tion Inhibitor) towards Gαi1, Gαi2 and Gαi3 [41, 87]. Through this
activity RGS12 and RGS14 can inhibit G protein signaling both by
accelerating GTP hydrolysis and by preventing G protein activa-
tion. Splice variants of RGS12 and RGS14 also contain membrane
targeting and protein-protein interaction domains [80, 89, 90].

Sigma receptors
Other protein targets →Sigma receptors
Overview: Although termed ’receptors’, the evidence for coupling through conventional signalling pathways is lacking. Initially described as a subtype of opioid receptors, there is only a modest
pharmacological overlap and no structural convergence with the G protein-coupled receptors; the crystal structure of the sigma1 receptor [81] suggests a trimeric structure of a single short transmembrane
domain traversing the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, with the bulk of the protein facing the cytosol. A wide range of compounds, ranging from psychoactive agents to antihistamines, have been
observed to bind to these sites.

Overview: Tubulins are a family of intracellular proteins most commonly associated with microtubules, part of the cytoskeleton. They are exploited for therapeutic gain in cancer chemotherapy as
targets for agents derived from a variety of natural products: taxanes, colchicine and vinca alkaloids. These are thought to act primarily through β-tubulin, thereby interfering with the normal processes
of tubulin polymer formation and disassembly.
