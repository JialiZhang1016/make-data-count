The aim of this study was to evaluate physicochemical properties and bioactive potential 
of Sealer Plus, in comparison with MTA Fillapex, Sealapex and AH Plus. Setting time, flow, 
and radiopacity were evaluated based on ISO 6876 Standard. Flow was also assessed in 
area (mm²). The solubility and volumetric change of the sealers were evaluated after 7 
and 30 days of immersion in distilled water. Solubility was evaluated by the difference 
in mass of materials before and after immersion. Volumetric change was evaluated by 
using microcomputed tomography (micro-CT). The bioactive potential was observed by 
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) after immersion in PBS. Data were compared using 
ANOVA and Tukey tests (α=0.05).  Sealer Plus presented the shortest setting time (196 
min.) and Sealapex the longest (912 min.) (p<0.05). AH Plus showed the highest radiopacity 
(9.5 mm Al) and MTA Fillapex the lowest (2.7 mm Al) (p<0.05). All the sealers presented 
flow in accordance with ISO 6876/2012 (>17 mm). Sealer Plus showed low solubility 
and volumetric change (<1%), and MTA Fillapex showed the highest solubility (>25%), 
and volumetric change (>4%) after all time intervals (p<0.05). MTA Fillapex was the 
only sealer that showed bioactive potential. In conclusion, Sealer Plus presented proper 
physicochemical properties. However, this sealer did not present a bioactive potential.

Introduction
The development of sealers with proper physicochemical 
and biological properties is important for successful 
endodontic treatment (1). Moreover, root canal sealers 
should be bioactive stimulating repair of the periapical 
tissues (2). 
Root canal filling materials are investigated by using 
standardized tests to evaluate setting time, flow, solubility, 
and radiopacity (3). The setting time should be long enough 
to allow the root canal filling (3). A proper flow allows sealer 
to penetrate into the irregularities of root canal system (4). 
A low solubility prevents change in structure or integrity 
of the sealer (5). The radiopacity allows radiographic 
evaluation of root canal filling (4). Currently, micro-
computed tomography (micro-CT) have been proposed 
to evaluate physical properties of endodontic materials 
(6-8). Micro-CT is a non-destructive tool, which presents 
the ability to evaluate materials three-dimensionally over 
time (7,8).
Endodontic sealers are divided according to their main 
components, such as resin, calcium oxide, and calcium 
silicate (9). The properties of these sealers are directly 
related to their composition (1). The presence of calcium 
oxide in the composition of endodontic materials has been 
suggested due to their ability to induce the formation of 
mineralized tissues, favoring the repair (9). Mineral Trioxide 
Aggregate (MTA) is widely used in Endodontics for vital 
pulp therapy, regenerative endodontic procedures, apical 
barrier in teeth with open apices, perforation repair, and 
root-end filling (10). The application of MTA promotes 
reduced inflammation and greater deposition of cementum 
(11). Root canal sealers based on salicylate resin combined 
with MTA or calcium oxide are available on the market. 
However, both materials have demonstrated high solubility 
(3,12). Epoxy resin–based sealer is considered the gold-
standard for physicochemical properties (13), in spite of 
not showing bioactive potential (2). Recently, a new epoxy 
resin-based sealer was developed with the presence of 
calcium hydroxide in its composition. There are few studies 
evaluating this sealer, which showed proper biological (1) 
and physicochemical (4) properties.
The aim of this study was to evaluate setting time, 
solubility, radiopacity, flow, volumetric stability, and 
bioactive potential of root canal filling materials. Therefore, 
this study was designed to evaluate the experimental 
hypothesis that endodontic sealer compositions affect the 
physicochemical properties of these sealers. 
Material and Methods
The endodontic sealers used in this study, their 
respective manufacturers and composition are described 
in Table 1.

Setting Time
The setting time test was conducted in accordance with 
ISO Standard 6876 (14). After manipulation, the sealer was 
placed in metal rings measuring 10 mm in diameter and 
1mm high (n=8). A Gilmore needle with mass of 100±0.5 
g and diameter of 2.0±0.1 mm was used, supported on 
the sealer surface. The sealers were kept in an oven at 37 
ºC and 95% humidity. The setting time was considered as 
the time when the marks of needle could not be observed 
on the sealer surface. 
Radiopacity
The radiopacity test was performed based on ISO 
Standard 6876 (14). Stainless steel rings measuring 10 mm 
in diameter and 1 mm high were used to fabricate 6 test 
specimens of each sealer. The specimens and an aluminum 
scale were placed on an occlusal film (Insight; Kodak 
Comp, Rochester, NY, USA) to take the radiograph (X-ray 
appliance -X GE 1000; General Electric, Milwaukee, WI, 
USA). The parameters used were 60 kV, 7 mA, 0.32 pulses 
per second and focal distance of 33 cm. The exposed films 
were processed, digitized, and evaluated by using Image 
J for Windows software, to determine the radiopacity 
equivalence of the sealers in millimeters of aluminum 
(mm Al).
Flow
The flow test was conducted in accordance with ISO 
Standard 6876 (14). After manipulation, 0.05 mL of the 
sealer was placed in the center of a glass plate by using a 
graduated syringe (n=6). At 180 ± 5 s after initiating the 
manipulation, another glass plate (20 g) was placed on 
the plate with the sealer, and a 100-g weight was put on 
the top plate, and kept there for 10 min. After this period, 
the maximum and minimum diameters of the sealer on 
the glass plate were measured, using a digital pachymeter 
(Mitutoyo MTI Corp., Huntersville, NC). When a difference 
of less than 1 mm between the diameters was observed, 
the mean value was recorded. A second evaluation was 
made by photographing the sealer on the plate alongside a 
millimeter ruler. The images obtained were evaluated using 
the Image Tool 3.0 software (UTHSCSA, San Antonio, TX) 
to obtain the area of flow of the sealer expressed in mm2, 
according to Tanomaru-Filho et al. (15).
Solubility
Based on a previous study (5), circular plastic molds 
measuring 1.5 mm high and 7.75 mm in diameter were 
placed on a glass plate covered with cellophane film. 
These molds were filled with each sealer (n=6). A nylon 
thread was embedded in the fresh sealer mixture, and 
another glass plate covered by cellophane was placed 
over the mold. After 3 times the duration of their setting 
time, the test specimens were removed from the molds 
and weighed in an analytical balance with accuracy of 
± 0.0001 g (AR2140, Toledo do Brasil Indústria de Balanças 
Ltda., São Bernardo do Campo, SP, Brazil), and the mean 
reading was recorded. The samples were placed in plastic 
receptacles with lids containing 7.5 mL of distilled and 
deionized water, suspended by nylon threads attached 
to the containers. The receptacles remained in the oven 
at  37 °C for 7 days. After this period, the test specimens 
were removed from the distilled water, dried and placed in 
a dehumidifying chamber. The mass was measured before 
and after immersion of the samples in distilled water, and 
every 24 h thereafter, until attaining mass stabilization. New 
samples were prepared and kept immersed in distilled water 
for 30 days. The mass loss was expressed as a percentage 
of the original mass.
Volumetric Change
Volumetric change of the sealers was analyzed based 
on previous studies (7,8). Transparent acrylic resin–based 
models were fabricated using metal molds with cavities

New epoxy resin-based root canal sealer
measuring 3 mm deep and 5 mm in diameter (n=6). The 
cavities were filled with each sealer and were kept in an 
oven at 37 ºC and relative humidity for 3 times the duration 
of their setting time. Scanning was performed by micro-CT 
imaging (SkyScan 1176; Bruker-microCT, Kontich, Belgium) 
and completed using 50 kV X-ray tube voltages and 500 
µA anode current; aluminum filter of 0.5; isotropic voxel 
of 18 μm; and an evolution cycle of 360°. The samples 
were scanned after setting and after 7 and 30 days of 
immersion of the specimens in distilled water. The images 
were reconstructed using NRecon software (V1.6.10.4; 
Bruker-MicroCT). The correction parameters for smoothing, 
beam hardening and ring artefacts were defined for each 
material (the parameters for AH Plus were 2 for smoothing, 
60 for beam hardening correction and 2 for ring artefacts 
correction, for Sealapex were 2 for smoothing, 55 for beam 
hardening and 2 for ring correction, for Sealer Plus were 1 
for smoothing, 50 for beam hardening and 1 for ring and for 
MTA Fillapex, 1, 40 and 1, respectively). The same parameters 
were used for the same materials in the different periods. 
The reconstructed images were superposed at the different 
experimental time intervals using the Data Viewer software 
(V1.5.2.4; Bruker-MicroCT, Kontich). The images were used 
for quantitative analysis of the samples, allowing the total 
volume of sealer to be calculated in mm3 by CTAn software 
(V1.15.4.0; Bruker-MicroCT). The volumetric change was 
calculated at each time interval.
Bioactive Potential
The bioactivity test was performed 
based on a previous study (16). The sealers 
were manipulated, inserted into cylindrical 
molds measuring 1 mm high x 7.5 mm in 
diameter and remained in an oven at 37ºC 
and 95% humidity until the complete setting. 
Subsequently, the samples were removed from 
the molds, and immersed in PBS solution (for 
500 mL of distilled water; anhydrous NaCl – 90 
g, Na2HPO4 – 13.65g; Na2H2PO2H2O – 2.42 
g), at 37ºC for 30 days. After this time interval, 
the samples were removed from the solution, 
and dried in a dehumidifier for 7 days, when 
their surfaces were metalized with carbon and 
analyzed by scanning electron microscopy 
(JSM-6610LV Scanning Electron Microscope, 
JEOL, Tokyo, Japan), in secondary electron 
(SE) mode with the purpose of identifying 
the mineral deposition on the sealer surfaces.
Statistical Analysis
The results obtained for all the tests were 
submitted to a normality test, and then to the 
parametric ANOVA statistical test and the Tukey multiple 
comparison test, with 5% significance level. 
Results 
Sealer Plus presented the shortest setting time, followed 
by AH Plus, MTA Fillapex and Sealapex (p<0.05). AH Plus 
showed the highest radiopacity, followed by Sealapex 
and Sealer Plus (p<0.05). MTA Fillapex had the lowest 
radiopacity (p<0.05). MTA Fillapex showed the highest flow, 
followed by AH Plus (p<0.05). Sealapex and Sealer Plus 
presented the lowest flow, which similar values (p>0.05). 
The results are represented in Table 2. 
The results for solubility and volumetric change are 
shown in Table 3. MTA Fillapex presented the highest 
solubility and volumetric change (volume loss) in both 
periods, followed by Sealapex (p<0.05). Sealer Plus and AH 
Plus showed the lowest solubility and volumetric change 
(p>0.05).
The external surface of the sealers in contact with PBS 
for 30 days was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy 
(SEM). The micrographs of the samples after the bioactive 
potential assay are represented in Figure 1. Sealapex, Sealer 
Plus, and AH Plus presented a similar microstructure. Except 
for MTA Fillapex, during the qualitative analysis, it was not 
possible to observe any mineral deposition on sealers surface 
(Fig. 1B, C, D). On the other hand, Figure 1A shows the

deposits on the surface of MTA Fillapex, suggesting its 
bioactive potential. 
Discussion
ISO 6876/2012 Standard (14) recommend values in 
accordance with the manufacturers’ indication for sealers 
with setting time between 30 min to 72 h. The setting 
time of sealers depends on their components (17). In the 
present study, Sealer Plus showed the shortest setting 
time, followed by AH Plus, which are epoxy resin-based 
sealers. The addition of calcium hydroxide in Sealer Plus 
may justify its shorter setting time, which could be related 
to the hydration of the sealer (18). The values observed 
is this study are in accordance with Vertuan et al. (4). 
MTA Fillapex and Sealapex showed longer setting time, as 
observed by Camilleri (19) and Viapiana et al. (3). This long 
setting time to MTA Fillapex can be related to salicylate 
resin. Salicylate resin-based endodontic sealers may not 
set in a dry environment (17). 
Setting time and solubility may be related, whereas 
a long setting time could favor solubility (5). Our study 
evaluated the solubility of the sealers based on a previous 
study that proposed samples with smaller dimensions 
without affecting the accuracy of the test (5). This 
methodology has been used to assess endodontic materials 
with different compositions (3,7,8).  MTA Fillapex presented 
the highest solubility in both time intervals (7 and 30 
days) followed by Sealapex. Both materials are salicylate 
resin-based sealers. The epoxy resin-based sealers (AH Plus 
and Sealer Plus) showed lower solubility, which may be 
related to its polymers with strong cross-links (12). Our 
results corroborate Silva et al. (20), who evaluated the 
dissolution of MTA Fillapex and AH Plus and observed a 
solubility of over 20% for MTA Fillapex after 28 days, while 
AH Plus maintained values below 1%. Viapiana et al. (3) 
also observed that Sealapex and MTA Fillapex had high 
solubility in water, and the authors attributed the high 
solubility of Sealapex to its setting reaction, resulting in 
a fragile matrix (12).

New epoxy resin-based root canal sealer
Although solubility of sealers may not allow proper 
sealing of root canal systems (4,5), the alkalinization ability 
is closely connected to the long setting time and solubility 
of materials (4). So, the highest solubility of MTA Fillapex 
probably resulted Ca+2 ion release (12). In the present 
study, the bioactive potential of the root canal sealers was 
evaluated by SEM after 30 days of immersion in PBS. The 
images obtained showed that only MTA Fillapex induced a 
mineral deposition on its surface, which may be related to 
the capacity of MTA for inducing mineralized tissue (21). 
Bioactive potential was not observed for the epoxy resin-
based sealers, probably due to the lack of ionized calcium 
ions (2). Even with the presence of calcium hydroxide in 
their composition, Sealapex and Sealer Plus did not show 
bioactive potential. Our results corroborate Vertuan et al. 
(4), who observed that Sealer Plus was not able to promote 
alkalizing. The authors justify this finding as a result of the 
epoxy resin in the composition of the sealer, and the low 
solubility of Sealer Plus.  
The conventional test performed to evaluate the 
solubility of endodontic sealers present some limitations, 
since the sealers can have water uptake or disintegration 
during the storage (7). These conditions cannot be observed 
only comparing the initial and final mass of the samples, 
leading to the search for new methodologies (8). Micro-CT 
is widely applied due its ability to allows three-dimensional 
evaluation (22). The volumetric change for endodontic 
materials measured by micro-CT after immersion in distilled 
water for time intervals of 7 and 30 days allows three-
dimensional evaluation, complementing the conventional 
solubility test (6,8). 
When Silva et al. (6) investigated the volumetric 
change for AH Plus and MTA Fillapex in human teeth after 
immersion in PBS, they observed no statistical differences 
between the sealers, in disagreement with our results. 
This divergence could be related to the methodology and 
immersion solution used.  Our results showed a volumetric 
loss for both MTA Fillapex and Sealapex, which could be 
explained by the high solubility of these sealers. Although 
Sealer Plus presented a mass loss in the solubility test, 
the sealer showed increase in volume, which suggested 
expansion after immersion in water. This is the first study 
to evaluate the volumetric change of Sealer Plus. A previous 
study evaluated the physicochemical properties of AH Plus 
after incorporation of calcium hydroxide, and observed an 
increase in the sealer expansion. The authors attributed the 
expansion to the hygroscopic effect of calcium hydroxide, 
which might have favored a higher water sorption and 
led to expansion of the sealer (23). This statement can 
justify the volume increase of Sealer Plus in the current 
study, since the volumetric changes do not depend on the 
solubility only, but also is related to dimensional changes 
such as contraction or expansion (6,8). Thus, volumetric 
change represents important information suggesting the 
clinical perspective of the sealer after root canal filling (7).
Radiopacity of the sealers allows its differentiation 
in relation to the adjacent anatomic structures (24). The 
ISO 6876/2012 Standard (14) recommends the minimum 
radiopacity value equivalent to 3 mm Al. MTA Fillapex 
demonstrated a radiopacity lower than the minimum 
recommended. Although proper radiopacity has been 
reported for MTA Fillapex (17), the present study evaluated 
the new version of the sealer that present the radiopacifying 
agent calcium tungstate as a substitute for bismuth oxide 
(25). A justification for the low values for MTA Fillapex may 
be related to lower radiopacifying potential of calcium 
tungstate (24). Although Sealer Plus showed radiopacity 
lower than AH Plus and Sealapex sealers, this sealer had 
a radiopacity in accordance with the ISO Standard, as 
observed in a previous study (4). Sealer Plus contains 
two chemical components responsible for its radiopacity, 
zirconium oxide and calcium tungstate.
The flow ability of root canal sealers is an important 
property to fill irregular areas of the root canal system 
(23). In this study, two methods of analysis were used to 
evaluate flow ability of the sealers. The first method was 
in accordance with the ISO 6876/2012 (14), using the 
diameter of the sealer after test, in millimeters. In order to 
complement the conventional test, which does not evaluate 
all area occupied by the sealers, an additional analysis was 
performed by means of the area (mm2), as proposed by 
Tanomaru-Filho et al. (15). All the sealers showed flow in 
accordance with the ISO specification, which recommends 
a minimum flow of 17 mm, corroborating with previous 
studies (3,4). Sealer Plus and Sealapex had lower values 
than AH Plus, probably because the calcium hydroxide 
decreases the flow of resin-based sealers (23). MTA Fillapex 
presents a film thickness less than 50 μm (19), a property 
that could justify its highest flow values.  
Sealer Plus is a recent sealer and few studies evaluated 
its properties, leading to the need of more investigations 
regarding the behavior of this sealer in a clinical 
environment. Sealer Plus shows proper physicochemical 
properties, such as flow, radiopacity, setting time, solubility, 
and volumetric stability. However, this sealer does not show 
bioactive potential.

antes e após imersão. A alteração volumétrica foi avaliada por meio de 
microtomografia computadorizada (micro-CT). O potencial bioativo dos 
cimentos foi observado por Microscopia Eletrônica de Varredura (MEV)

a radiopacidade mais alta (9.5 mm Al) e MTA Fillapex a mais baixa (2.7 
mm Al) (p<0.05). Todos os cimentos tiveram escoamento de acordo com 
as normas ISO 6876/2012 (>17 mm). Sealer Plus mostrou baixos valores 
de solubilidade e alteração volumétrica (<1%) e MTA Fillapex teve os 
valores mais altos de solubilidade (>25%) e alteração volumétrica (>4%) 
em todos os períodos avaliados (p<0.05). MTA Fillapex foi o único cimento 
que mostrou potencial bioativo. Como conclusão, Sealer Plus apresentou 
propriedades físico-químicas adequadas, entretanto, não apresentou 
potencial bioativo.
