Abstract
Background: RNA splicing is a key post-transcriptional mechanism that generates protein diversity and contributes
to the fine-tuning of gene expression, which may facilitate adaptation to environmental challenges. Here, we
employ a systems approach to study alternative splicing changes upon enteric infection in females from classical
Drosophila melanogaster strains as well as 38 inbred lines.
Results: We find that infection leads to extensive differences in isoform ratios, which results in a more diverse
transcriptome with longer 5′ untranslated regions (5′UTRs). We establish a role for genetic variation in mediating
inter-individual splicing differences, with local splicing quantitative trait loci (local-sQTLs) being preferentially located
at the 5′ end of transcripts and directly upstream of splice donor sites. Moreover, local-sQTLs are more numerous in
the infected state, indicating that acute stress unmasks a substantial number of silent genetic variants. We observe
a general increase in intron retention concentrated at the 5′ end of transcripts across multiple strains, whose
prevalence scales with the degree of pathogen virulence. The length, GC content, and RNA polymerase II
occupancy of these introns with increased retention suggest that they have exon-like characteristics. We further
uncover that retained intron sequences are enriched for the Lark/RBM4 RNA binding motif. Interestingly, we find
that lark is induced by infection in wild-type flies, its overexpression and knockdown alter survival, and tissue-
specific overexpression mimics infection-induced intron retention.
Conclusion: Our collective findings point to pervasive and consistent RNA splicing changes, partly mediated by
Lark/RBM4, as being an important aspect of the gut response to infection.

Background
The eukaryotic transcriptome is regulated by diverse
mechanisms that ensure robustness and flexibility to
adapt to different conditions. Alternative mRNA splicing
is one mechanism that contributes to achieving this
complex task. Among its postulated functions is an in-
crease in the repertoire of protein-coding genes through
the production of multiple isoforms [1]. In addition,
mRNA splicing could contribute to (post) transcriptional
regulation in that transcript isoforms with the same cod-
ing potential can still feature diverse untranslated re-
gions or alternative transcription start sites, which may
affect RNA stability and/or translation efficiency [2].
This form of transcriptional regulation can also be af-
fected by external stressors, notably heat shock [3–6], as
first shown in Drosophila through the accumulation of
Hsp83 and Adh pre-mRNAs at severe temperatures [7].
While there are several examples of interactions between
splicing and cell stress [3–6, 8], there have been very few
genome-wide studies exploring this phenomenon [6].
The Drosophila gut has lately attracted a lot of atten-
tion in the scientific community as a convenient system

to study intestinal homeostasis in normal and diseased
conditions [9]. Far from being a simple digestive tube,
we now know that it is a highly compartmentalized, dy-
namic, and immunocompetent organ [10]. Contact with
pathogenic bacteria leads to the mobilization of potent
immune and stress responses, followed by homeostatic
processes, all of which need to be tightly regulated. Sev-
eral studies have already dissected the transcriptional
programs of the innate immune system, demonstrating
that a considerable level of gene regulation is achieved
through the action of several transcription factors [11].
However, the importance of post-transcriptional regula-
tion in the innate immune response is only beginning to
be appreciated [12]. Here, we performed a systematic
analysis of alternative splicing in the context of enteric
infection in Drosophila melanogaster. In addition to clas-
sical laboratory strains, we made use of a large RNA se-
quencing study of 38 inbred lines from the Drosophila

Panel
(DGRP)
to
study
this
phenomenon in different environmental conditions and
genetic backgrounds [13]. Next to characterizing the ef-
fect of genetic polymorphisms, we found considerable
and reproducible (i.e., genotype-independent) changes in
transcript splicing following infection, with a tendency
to have more intron retention and thus longer tran-
scripts. Introns with increased retention were overrepre-
sented at the 5′ end of transcripts and were enriched for
the RNA binding motif (RBM) of Lark/RBM4. Through
knockdown and overexpression of lark in adult female
enterocytes, we found that lark levels can affect intron
retention and modulate fly survival after enteric infec-
tion. Our work thus provides new insights into the dy-
namics
and
importance
of
the
alternative
splicing
landscape during an innate immune response.
Results
Enteric infection leads to extensive changes in transcript
isoform ratios
We used RNA-sequencing data generated from the whole
guts of 38 DGRP lines that were infected with Pseudo-
monas entomophila (P.e.). Among these 38 lines, respect-
ively 20 and 18 lines are susceptible and resistant to oral
infection with P.e [13]. In addition, we sequenced the guts
of control flies, which were fed sucrose, for a total of 76
samples (Additional file 2). Since the lines are highly poly-
morphic, we opted to use individualized genomes and
gene annotations for our analyses using available single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), indel, and structural
variation data for each line [14] (see the “Methods” sec-
tion). Given the focus of this study on gaining insights into
changes in isoform composition of each gene after infec-
tion, we used a multivariate distance-based approach de-
scribed in [15]. Briefly, we estimated the isoform ratios,
that is, the relative ratio of alternative isoforms of each
gene, using MISO [16]. We then identified genes showing
significant infection-induced differences in isoform ratios
[17]. Of the 1877 genes that passed filtering (see the
“Methods” section), 40% were significantly changed after
infection (Fig. 1a, p value of homogeneity > 0.05, BH-
corrected p value < 0.05, effect size > 0.2, Additional file 3).
Interestingly, only 25% of the differentially spliced genes
were among the 2471 genes that were differentially
expressed after infection, suggesting that gene-level differ-
ential expression-type analyses may overlook important
molecular aspects of the gut transcriptional response to
enteric infection (Additional file 3). Gene ontology ana-
lysis revealed that genes associated with mRNA splicing,
organelle organization and biogenesis, as well as tissue de-
velopment are enriched within the set of differentially
spliced genes (Fig. 1b). Surprisingly however, this set was
not enriched for immunity terms. This may reflect differ-
ent regulatory properties of genes involved in the immedi-
ate innate immune response (i.e., in the resistance
mechanisms [20]), many of which are significantly induced
after infection, versus those involved in homeostasis (i.e.,
the tolerance mechanisms [20]), which might be required
to function in the normal and infected state. When com-
paring resistant and susceptible lines within each condi-
tion, we were not able to find differentially spliced genes,
although some genes showed modest trends (Add-
itional file 1: Figure S1a).
The transcriptional response is characterized by higher
isoform diversity
We next examined the effect of infection on the diversity of
the transcriptome by calculating the gene-based Shannon
entropy for each sample. This is a measure of the evenness
of the proportions of a gene’s isoforms. We found that in-
fection leads to a small but consistent increase in diversity
in the infected state (p value for treatment effect on average
Shannon diversity = 3.7e−05, Fig. 1c, Additional file 1: Fig-
ure S1b-c, Additional file 4). The density plot of Shannon
entropies revealed that after infection, there is a bias to-
wards increase in the number of genes with higher diver-
sity, and consequently fewer genes with lower diversity,
where across the different DGRP strains, there is an average
of 20, and a maximum of 330, more genes that increase in
diversity after infection (Fig. 1c). This net increase was con-
sistent in 37 different strains irrespective of their resistance
class (Additional file 1: Figure S1b), suggesting that this is
not a stochastic phenomenon. Interestingly, a breakdown
by isoform number revealed that for genes with 2, 3, or 4
isoforms, resistant lines show a tendency for greater average
diversity than susceptible lines (Fig. 1d, Additional file 1:
Figure S1c). With the exception of genes with four isoforms
in the infected state (linear model p value for resistance
class = 0.0192), this tendency is not statistically significant.

transcriptional output of many genes is less dominated by a
single or few isoforms. This phenomenon is more marked
in lines that are resistant to P.e. infection, which may point
to a link between increased isoform diversity and greater in-
fection resistance.
The effect of natural variation on splicing increases after
infection
We have thus far established that enteric infection leads
to a change in isoform abundance of a large set of genes,
thereby increasing overall isoform diversity. We next

genes with different isoform ratios are compared between two conditions. MISO [16] was used to calculate the ratios of different annotated

sought to establish whether genetic variation affects iso-
form ratios. To this end, we identified local splicing
quantitative trait loci (local-sQTLs) in the two infection
states using sQTLseekeR [21]. We restricted our analysis
to SNPs within a 10-kb window around each gene (see
the “Methods” section), hence our annotation of “local-
sQTLs”.
We
identified
359
and
646
control-
and
infection-specific local-sQTLs, and 282 local-sQTLs that
are common to both conditions (Fig. 2a, Additional file
5). Interestingly, there were around 80% more local-
sQTLs in the infected state, affecting more than twice as
many genes as in the control state (96 vs. 39 genes) al-
though a similar number of genes were tested in the two
conditions (1238 vs 1248 for controls and infected, re-
spectively). In addition, a greater percentage of genes
with a local-sQTL in the infected state showed signifi-
cant differences in isoform ratios upon infection (Fig. 2a).
These results demonstrate that inter-strain differences in

and ISE locations were predicted along all gene bodies using pattern matching to the reference genome after which the percentage of local-
sQTLs that overlapped a predicted element was computed and plotted in red. A null distribution of the percentage overlap was produced by
randomly sampling variants within gene bodies with a similar allele frequency distribution as the local-sQTLs. This was repeated 100 times and
the percentage, as well as the mean (blue solid line) and standard deviations (dashed lines) were computed. A solid line shows the maximum
overlap obtained through random permutations

isoform ratios can be attributed to alterations in the gen-
omic DNA sequence and that enteric infection unmasks
a substantial amount of otherwise silent genetic variants
that affect splicing.
To gain insights into which biological processes are
enriched in the genes that have local-sQTLs, we per-
formed separate gene ontology enrichment of the three
sets of genes: control, infected, and shared local-sQTLs
genes. Figure 2b shows a combined graphical representa-
tion of the three GO enrichment results. In the control
state, we observed an enrichment of GO terms related
to cellular and nitrogen compound metabolic processes.
In the infected state, other categories emerged, namely
cellular response to stress, cell cycle, and aging. As in
the enrichment for infection-induced splicing changes,
we did not find any enrichment for immune-related pro-
cesses, but mostly homeostatic mechanisms. This could
either mean that splicing is not a major regulator of ca-
nonical immunity pathways or that there is strong se-
lective pressure against genetic variation that affects
splicing in immunity-related genes.
Next, we examined the location of the detected local-
sQTLs in relation to their respective genes. We used a
gene-centric
and
intron-centric
approach
to
obtain
metaplots. Since natural variation density along genes is
not uniform, and tends to be higher towards the 5′ ends
[14], we generated a null distribution by considering sets
of randomly selected variants that are located within 10
kb around genes and that have a matching allele fre-
quency spectrum to the local-sQTLs. We found that
both the null and the observed local-sQTL distributions
show a peak around the TSS of genes (Fig. 2c, Add-
itional file 1: Figure S2a). However, while the null distri-
bution had a single symmetrical peak with wide tails, the
local-sQTL density one had a higher density at the main
5′ end, as well as an elevated plateau along the metagene
body. This density distribution could be the reflection of
multiple possible effects of variants on isoform ratios.
One such effect is at the DNA level, where alternative
TSS selection could be affected by variants around the
5′ end. Other effects can be through directly modulating
splicing all along the transcript. A third type can be
modulating transcript stability, which can also be located
anywhere on the gene body.
To gain further insights into how local-sQTLs could
be mediating differences in splicing, we also calculated
the local-sQTL density distribution around introns as
well as a respective null distribution. Interestingly, we
observed a pattern that is very distinct from the null dis-
tribution. While the latter showed a wide peak that is
centered around the 5′ end of introns, the local-sQTL
distribution exhibited a sharp peak at the 5′ end, with a
much greater density of sQTLs immediately upstream
compared
to
downstream
of
the
intron
(Fig.
2d,
Additional file 1: Figure S2a). In addition, the number of
sQTLs dropped sharply at the boundaries of introns. As
may have been expected, these data support the notion
that genetic variants that affect splicing largely act by in-
ducing differences in the processes that are required for
splicing, predominantly around the 5′ splice site. One
such local-sQTL example is in the gene Psi, which has a
local-sQTL at a splice site (Additional file 1: Figure S2b-
d). Lines with different alleles at this locus showed
markedly different splicing patterns, with a clear shift in
the major isoform produced in both conditions. How-
ever, not all local-sQTLs could be assigned such a direct
mechanism of action, as some might have more subtle
effects, for example by affecting exonic and intronic spli-
cing enhancers (ESEs and ISEs) that affect the recruit-
ment of RNA binding factors. To assess this possibility,
we asked whether it is more likely that a local-sQTL
overlaps with an ESE or ISE. Since these splicing enhan-
cer sequences are short hexamers, predicting them along
the genome produces many false positives. Nevertheless,
we considered a set of 330 published enhancers [22] and
looked for matches along all the gene bodies (Additional
file 5). We then counted the overlap between the local-
sQTLs and 100 random sets of variants with a matching
allele frequency spectrum. Interestingly, 70% of the
local-sQTLs overlapped a predicted enhancer, which is
10% higher and 6.1 standard deviations away from the
mean of random samples (Fig. 2e). This enrichment in-
dicates that some of the local-sQTLs that lie within ESEs
and ISEs could be mediating isoform ratios by affecting
splicing enhancer function. Taken together, our local-
sQTL data shows that we can detect effects of natural
variation on splicing, even more in the infected state,
and suggests that these effects are due to direct changes
in splice sites, as well as other mechanisms predomin-
antly at or around the splice donor site. These results
also again indicate that splicing changes in the infected
state are regulated processes and not merely a result of
stochastic perturbations.
Post-infection transcripts tend to be longer, mainly
because of longer 5′UTRs
We next sought to characterize the effect of the splicing
changes on the length of the produced transcripts. To
do so, we estimated an effective length measure for each
gene. Briefly, for each gene in each sample, we estimated
the effective gene length as the weighted mean of its in-
dividual transcripts (taking indels of individual lines into
account) by the isoform ratios (Additional file 6). Simi-
larly, we extended this method to specific regions within
the transcript, namely the 5′UTR, 3′UTR, and the cod-
ing sequence. We then compared the effective length be-
fore and after infection to determine the number of
genes
with
an
increased,
decreased,
or
unchanged

effective length (Fig. 3a). We generated a null distribu-
tion of effective length differences by performing 100
permutations of the data, by randomly assigning infec-
tion status to the samples, and compared this to our ob-
served set using G-tests. The effect of indels on the
coefficient of variation in feature length—that is when
we calculate the effect that indels have on the sequence
length in the DGRPs without taking expression levels
into account—was most prominent in 3′UTRs. How-
ever, when we factor in isoform ratios, and calculate the
variation in effective lengths, 5′UTRs showed the highest
variation (Additional file 1: Figure S3a, Additional file 6).
3′UTR lengths deviated the most from the null distribu-
tion, and their infection-induced differences were lower
than expected. However, the proportion of those that in-
creased in effective length was close to those that
decreased in response to infection (23.2% vs. 24.1 re-
spectively, Fig. 3b, Additional file 1: Figure S3b-c). Fur-
thermore, by classifying genes based on how 3′UTRs
may affect their effective length, we found no difference
in the contribution of polyadenylation site usage and
splicing (Additional file 1: Figure S3d). In contrast to the
3′UTR, we found that around 7% more genes increase
rather than decrease in transcript and 5′UTR effective
length (paired t test p values = 1.9e−05 and 1.2e−06 re-
spectively). Predicted polypeptide length, however, did
not show differences from the null distribution nor any
skew. Importantly, the distribution of this shift in effect-
ive length was consistent across the DGRP lines, with
transcripts and 5′UTRs having an excess of increased ef-
fective lengths, thus supporting that this is a reprodu-
cible
and
genotype-independent
phenomenon
Fig. 3 Post-infection transcripts tend to be longer, mainly due to the generation of longer 5′ UTRs. a The line-specific effective length of each
gene’s transcript, CDS, 5′UTR, and 3′UTR length was obtained by calculating the weighted sum of each gene’s isoform features by its isoform
ratios. The difference in effective length between the P.e. infected state and the uninfected (control) state was then calculated for each line. b
The percentage of features that increased, decreased, or did not change in average length (across samples) after infection. Error bars are the
standard deviation. A null distribution was generated by performing 100 permutations by randomly shuffling the samples. The gray bars indicate
the average obtained by permutations. Repeated G-tests were used to compare the feature length change in each line to the null distribution.
The boxplots show the –log10(p values) of the tests, with the dotted red line representing a Bonferroni-corrected p value threshold. c Similar to
previous panel, but this time the effective length of each transcript without either the predicted polypeptide, 3′UTR, or 5′UTR was calculated
Bou Sleiman et al. Genome Biology            (2020) 21:4 
Page 6 of 19
(Additional file 1: Figure S3b-c). To show which feature
contributes to the effective length change the most, we
performed a similar analysis, this time calculating the
infection-induced change in transcript effective length
after the removal of a specific feature. We found that the
removal of 5′UTR length and not the predicted polypep-
tide nor 3′UTR abolished this skew in the proportions
(Fig. 3c). Together, these results suggest that infection-
induced differences in isoform ratios preferentially affect
5′UTRs and favor the production of isoforms with lon-
ger 5′UTRs across genotypes.
Intron retention increases following infection and its
prevalence scales with the degree of pathogenicity
The increase in effective gene length prompted us to in-
vestigate splicing at the intron level. Using an available
annotation that is specific to intron retention events
from the MISO annotation website, we estimated the
percent spliced-in (PSI or Ψ) value for each of the 32,
895 introns using MISO [16] (Fig. 4a, Additional file 7).
This annotation was established based on RNA sequen-
cing of 30 whole animal samples from 27 distinct devel-
opment stages as part of the modENCODE project [23].
The reliance on two sources of annotations, a gene-
centric one with full transcript isoforms from Ensembl
and intron-centric one, renders the task of mapping the
effect of changes in individual events on whole isoform
abundance non-trivial, especially when using short-read
sequencing. A limitation that we therefore acknowledge
is that not all intron retention events can be directly
mapped to an annotated gene. However, despite this
limitation, we hypothesized that if a systematic and con-
sistent increase in intron retention based on intron-
centric annotations is detected, this may explain why
transcripts tend to be longer after infection.
PSI reflects the number of intron retention reads (i.e.,
spanning the exon-intron boundary as well as the reads
in the intron) divided by the sum of the number of
intron-retention and intron-splicing reads (i.e., spanning
the exon-exon boundary as well as in the flanking
exons).
In
contrast
to
steady-state
analyses,
our
population-level data from two conditions allowed us to
investigate infection-induced changes in intron retention
and whether they are restricted to specific transcripts or
reflect mere random splicing events. We thereby defined
introns with increased retention as introns that signifi-
cantly increase in PSI (positive delta PSI, bayes factor >
10) whereas introns with reduced intron retention are
those that significantly decrease in PSI (negative delta
PSI, bayes factor > 10). As shown in Fig. 4b, we uncov-
ered a large number of introns with increased retention
(535) and decreased retention (331) that are significant
in at least 5 DGRP lines (bayes factor > 10, delta psi >
0.2, also see Additional file 1: Figure S4a-b). These data
thus suggest that DGRP strains react similarly to infec-
tion. For instance, among the 535 events with increased
intron retention in 5 strains, 510 never decreased in re-
tention, 13 decreased in one DGRP strain, 11 in two
strains, and one in four strains. Moreover, using the R
package SuperExactTest [24], we found that the overlap
of introns with increased retention between strains was
highly significant. For example, the expected overlap in
two and four DGRP lines is less than 10 and 0.001
events, respectively, whereas the median observed over-
lap was 133 and 59, again suggesting non-random RNA
splicing changes. Interestingly, there were 1.6 times
more events with a positive compared to a negative delta
PSI (535 vs 331 respectively), indicating a net increase in
retention post-infection.
It is not clear whether the observed intron retention
change is specific to P.e and whether different pathogens
induce a similar response. We addressed this point by
generating paired-end RNA-sequencing data of adult fe-
male guts of the widely used w1118 strain infected with
the lethal P.e. and a non-lethal pathogen, Erwinia caroto-
vora carotovora 15 (Ecc15). Adult female flies were ei-
ther fed with sucrose (1.5X), P.e (OD600 = 100 and 1.5X
sucrose), or Ecc15 (OD600 = 100 and 1.5X sucrose).
When we compared the two infection conditions to the
uninfected control state, we found that both conditions
differed from the control in intron retention events
(Fig. 4c, d, 493 and 200 events in P.e. and Ecc15 respect-
ively, bayes factor > 10, delta psi > 0.2). In addition, we
found a high degree of overlap among the DGRP lines,
as well as between the DGRP and the w1118 data (Fig. 4e),
supporting the notion that this phenomenon determinis-
tically affects a specific set of introns. Nevertheless,
Ecc15 infection yielded fewer differences overall and had
proportionally fewer retention events, 40% of which were
shared with the P.e. condition (Additional file 1: Figure
S4c-d). While we only tested infection as an insult in
this study, we nevertheless speculate that other interven-
tions may lead to similar changes in splicing. Thus, we
postulate
that
infection-induced
splicing
differences
occur in response to different pathogens, and scale with
the degree of virulence, infection severity, or stress.
Introns with increased retention have exon-like
characteristics and are enriched for known RNA-binding
motifs
We next aimed at characterizing the retained and spliced
introns. A meta-analysis of the location of introns with
increased and decreased retention showed that the dens-
ity of introns with increased retention is very high at the
5′ end of transcripts, which partly explains why longer
UTRs are being produced after infection (Fig. 5a). We
then compared their length and GC content, both of
which are known parameters that determine exon and

intron specification [28, 29]. In terms of length, introns
with increased retention tend to be shorter than the
ones with decreased retention (Fig. 5b, Additional file 1:
Figure S5a). In addition, their GC content tends to be
higher, and consequently, the difference in GC content
between the introns and their flanking exons was lower
(Fig. 5c). Next, we performed RNA Polymerase II ChIP-
seq on female guts under control and infected condi-
tions to consider its intron occupancy as an additional
characterization parameter (see the “Methods” section).

Interestingly, we found that introns with increased re-
tention also show greater enrichment for RNA polymer-
ase II irrespective of treatment condition (Fig. 5d,
Additional file 1: Figure S5b, see the “Methods” section).
We did not find any enrichment of biological processes
for the genes affected by intron retention. Together,
these results suggest that retained introns tend to exhibit
exon-like characteristics. To formally and independently
validate this hypothesis, we overlaid a list of experimen-
tally verified Drosophila upstream Open Reading Frames
(uORFs) with our data [30]. We found that introns with
significantly increased retention in more than 4 DGRP
lines are more likely to contain a uORF (paired one-
tailed t test p value = 8.2e−8, Fig. 5e, see the “Methods”
section). In fact, when we investigated introns with in-
creased retention in each DGRP line separately, we
found that there is generally a greater proportion that
overlaps a uORF (Additional file 1: Figure S5c). Thus,
our observations suggest that many introns with in-
creased retention may act as uORFs.
The extensive overlap in introns with increased reten-
tion among DGRP lines suggests that this process is
driven by a deterministic mechanism, possibly involving
specific RNA-binding proteins whose differential activity
may be responsible for the observed differences. Indeed,
it is known that RNA-binding proteins contribute to
splicing by binding specific targets in nascent transcripts
in a context-dependent manner [31, 32]. We therefore
assessed enrichment of RNA-binding motif (RBM) sites
in the introns with decreased and increased retention,
using as background those introns that did not change
significantly. We used AME [26], from the MEME suite
[27], to determine enrichment of experimentally derived
RBMs in the sequences of introns and the 50 bases
flanking them from each side [25]. We found enrich-
ment of many RBMs in the introns with decreased re-
tention, but few RBMs in those with increased retention
(Fig. 5f, Additional file 1: Figure S5d,e). Furthermore,
upon scanning for motif sequences in these introns, we
observed that introns with increased retention not only
have more predicted motif binding sites, as expected be-
cause of their longer sequences, but also tend to have
more motif matches close to the introns’ 5′ splice site.
These results suggest that introns with increased reten-
tion after infection have generally weaker and fewer spli-
cing signals than those introns that efficiently undergo
splicing.
The RNA-binding protein Lark mediates gut
immunocompetence
The lower number of enriched RBMs in the introns with
increased retention may indicate that intron retention is
generally driven by infection-induced splicing impair-
ments. However, the fact that these introns are shared
across inbred lines and distinct pathogens suggests the
involvement of a non-random process. To further ad-
dress this hypothesis, we focused on Lark, since its RBM
was the most enriched in the sequences of introns with
increased retention, and investigated its possible involve-
ment in the gut’s response to infection. Lark is the
ortholog of human RBM4, an RNA-binding protein im-
plicated in splicing, translation, and the stress response.
In humans, it has been shown to be activated through
phosphorylation by the p38 MAPK pathway in response
to stress, where it shuttles out of the nucleus and affects
translation of different targets [5]. The MAPK pathway,
specifically through p38c, has been shown to mediate
the Drosophila gut immune response to enteric infection
through its effect on the transcription factor Atf-2 [33].
To investigate Lark’s involvement in the defense re-
sponse, we performed overexpression and knockdown
specifically in the adult gut enterocytes using the Myo1A-
Gal4 driver in conjunction with tub-Gal80ts (Myo1Ats).
Surprisingly, we observed that both knockdown and over-
expression of lark in adult enterocytes resulted in en-
hanced survival compared to WT (Myo1Ats > w1118), with
the overexpression transgenic flies being the most resist-
ant to P.e. infection (Fig. 6). We validated lark knockdown
and overexpression by performing RT-qPCR on dissected
guts and found that indeed, there was up to 80% knock-
down and 80–100 times overexpression in comparison to
WT levels. Our observations point to a significant contri-
bution of Lark in the gut response to infection, whereby
modulation of its expression levels (either up or down)
significantly impacts on overall pathogen susceptibility.
The experiments described above do not provide in-
sights, however, into whether Lark affects intron reten-
tion.
We
therefore
performed
RNA-sequencing
of
control and infected guts of flies in which lark was over-
expressed or knocked-down in adult enterocytes. We
first performed gene-based differential expression ana-
lysis to characterize Lark-mediated differences. Interest-
ingly, compared to the control and in line with our
phenotypic observations, both Lark perturbations led to
similar expression differences in terms of genes and gene
sets (Fig. 6b, Additional
file
1: Figure S6b, Add-
itional file 8). Notably, we observed an enrichment for
gene sets related to cell fate determination and cell rec-
ognition in the upregulated genes.
We performed the same intron retention analysis as be-
fore, but this time, we compared guts with perturbed lark
expression to wild type (control and infected). We ob-
served a similar increase in intron retention in all the ge-
notypes, meaning that Lark is not strictly required for
infection-induced intron retention (776, 918, and 829
events in the control, knockdown, and overexpression flies,
Fig. 7a). However, when compared to infected wild-type
guts, their lark knockdown counterparts exhibited less

Page 10 of 19
intron retention (318 vs 691 events, Fig. 7b). Interestingly,
overexpression of lark led to an important increase in in-
tron retention, even in the control state (474 and 691 in
control and infected, respectively, Fig. 7b), and the distri-
bution of introns with increased retention remained con-
centrated
at
the
5′UTR,
especially
when
lark
was
overexpressed (Fig. 7c, d). In addition, enrichment of the
Lark RBM in introns that were retained due to infection
was proportional to lark levels (Fig. 7e). Moreover, introns
with increased retention due to lark overexpression in the
uninfected state were also enriched for the Lark RBM
(Fig. 7f), indicating that increasing Lark levels directly
leads to intron retention of a specific set of genes. We also
found an enrichment of the Lark RBM in the introns that
are less retained in the knockdown compared to controls
(Fig. 7f), providing further evidence for the direct contri-
bution of this RNA-binding protein in infection- and
stress-induced splicing regulation.
Discussion
The gut response to infection involves concerted mecha-
nisms that optimally lead to the clearance of the
pathogen and the restoration of cellular homeostasis. An
organism must quickly and reversibly adapt to the chal-
lenge to ensure survival. Transcription factors that act in
response to stimuli, such as Relish (the IMD pathway),
Atf-2 (MAPK pathway), and STAT92E (JAK/STAT
pathway), have all been studied in the context of gut in-
fection, damage, and regeneration [9, 34–37], and we
and others have characterized the regulatory function of
those transcription factors [9, 36, 38, 39]. However, an-
other major aspect of transcriptional regulation, splicing,
has so far been largely ignored. Here, we present the first
characterization of the splicing differences that occur
after enteric infection by using a genetic reference panel
of flies as well as standard laboratory strains. We found
that infection induces widespread and consistent splicing
changes in 38 Drosophila strains. Only 25% of the genes
in our data that exhibited significant infection-induced
splicing differences were also differentially expressed
after infection. This suggests that splicing is another, so
far underappreciated, component in the organism’s
defense against enteric pathogens through the gener-
ation of molecular diversity. This is in line with our

observation of a consistent increase in isoform species
diversity, as measured by the Shannon diversity index,
after infection. This diversity might be favored in times
of cellular stress, expanding the cell’s repertoire of tran-
scriptional products. Intriguingly, this increased diversity
is also coupled to an increase in splicing QTLs. The
identification of twice as many local-sQTLs in the
infected state as well as their relative location with re-
spect to genes points to an important role for genetic
variation in shaping the gut response to infection. This
opens up the possibility that genetic predisposition to
stress can be mediated through altered levels of splicing,
even though we observed only mild differences in spli-
cing between susceptible and resistant lines. We thereby

note that, since our analyses rely on existing annotations
of full transcripts, we cannot rule out the possibility that
these annotations may be incomplete or that local gen-
etic variation may lead to the expression of novel iso-
forms. Nevertheless, it is likely that our identified sQTLs
on annotated isoform abundance are still valid indicators
of genetically driven differences in splicing, yet the exact
number of isoforms and the contribution of individual
splicing events on the ratios may not be completely ac-
curate. Altogether, we believe that variation in gut im-
munocompetence
cannot
be
explained
by
a
single
pathway or mechanism given the multifaceted and com-
plex nature of this phenotype, but rather by a combin-
ation of different factors of which splicing may be
another important one [13].
Since we are sequencing poly-A enriched RNA, and
not nascent RNA, this diversity increase can possibly be
explained by the presence of a mixture of pre-infection
and post-infection mRNA species in the same cell and/
or by an increased heterogeneity across cells. Other hy-
potheses can be equally valid. For instance, it could be
the result of a general loss of fidelity of transcriptional
and post-transcriptional mechanisms, leading to an in-
crease in molecular noise. Studies in human cell lines
have shown that noisy splicing is a common feature of
genomes [40]. Studies in yeast have shown that gene ex-
pression noise confers a fitness advantage after acute se-
vere stress [41], much like our infection model. Indeed,
we observed fewer splicing differences and intron reten-
tion after Ecc15 infection, a non-lethal enteric pathogen.
However, our findings clearly revealed that infection
leads to consistent differences in splicing and intron re-
tention across genotypes and types of pathogens. This
observation argues against the increased-noise theory
and in favor of a deterministic process that may consti-
tute a more general response to stress, thus beyond the
infection model used here.
Our findings on the extent and nature of introns with
increased retention are consistent with earlier work
showing that widespread intron retention in humans
and mouse samples under steady-state conditions is
coupled to RNA Pol II pausing [42]. In addition, reduced
intron length and higher GC content were revealed as
predictors of intron retention [28]. Nascent RNA-
sequencing experiments in Drosophila S2 cells and
whole heads, in steady-state, have shown that intron re-
tention tends to be higher in the first intron [43]. In-
deed, many of the infection-induced changes in our
analyses are at the 5′ end of transcripts, including the 5′
UTRs, which means that infection-induced splicing
changes could have more of a regulatory rather than
coding function. A large portion of retained introns may
thereby function as uORFs given our observation that
introns
with
increased
retention
have
a
greater
likelihood of overlapping with experimentally mapped
uORFs [30] compared to introns with decreased reten-
tion. Since uORFs have been shown in Drosophila to
mostly modulate CDS translation efficiency [30], we
speculate that the major regulatory function of such
uORFs in introns with infection-induced retention is to
negatively affect protein translation initiation by compet-
ing for ribosomes. Inhibition of translation is a well-
documented aspect of the gut response to pathogenic
bacteria, so far shown to be mediated by the activation
of the GCN2 kinase and subsequent phosphorylation of
eIF2α, which in turn results into limited translation initi-
ation [33, 38]. It is thus conceptually intuitive that the
observed intron retention program may act as a comple-
mentary process to modulating protein translation in re-
sponse to infection. This may be especially true for
specific gene sets including those coding for splicing fac-
tors themselves, which tend to be particularly affected
by intron retention across systems and species [44].
Nevertheless, the ultimate consequence of intron reten-
tion may well be gene- and context-specific as uORFs
have also been shown to promote translation such as is
the case for the stress-linked transcription factors ATF4
and ATF5 [45–47]. More integrative and targeted prote-
ome or ribosome profiling studies will be required to in-
form on these different scenarios.
The observation that introns with increased retention
are enriched for the Lark motif led us to investigate the
involvement of Lark in the gut defense response. In the
fly, this gene has mostly been studied in the context of
circadian biology and eye development [48, 49]. In mam-
mals, however, several reports have been published im-
plicating its orthologue, RBM4, in the response to stress
through regulation of splicing, transcript stability, and
translation control [5, 50]. In this study, we found that
enteric infection increased lark levels, but surprisingly,
both lower and higher levels of lark, compared to con-
trols, enhanced infection resistance, implying dosage
sensitivity. Nevertheless, modulating lark levels alone
was sufficient to affect intron retention, especially in
Lark RBM-enriched introns, irrespective of infection sta-
tus. These findings therefore identify Lark as a mediator
of both infection-induced splicing differences as well as
resistance to infection, but the precise relationship
between
these
two
processes
warrants
further
investigation.
Conclusion
In this study, we were able to implicate Lark in
infection-induced splicing differences, as well as resist-
ance to infection, but many questions remain un-
answered. Lark seems to be intimately involved in the
Drosophila gut defense response, yet its downstream ef-
fect
on
the
expression
of
its
targets
is
still

uncharacterized. Moreover, the factors controlling lark
expression and induction in the gut are still unknown.
Finally, it is not clear whether the action of Lark is a
general stress response or whether its action is adapted
to the nature and severity of the stimulus. Answering
these questions will increase our knowledge about the
functional relevance of splicing in the enteric defense
and general cellular stress response.
Methods
Fly stocks and infection experiments
DGRP lines were obtained from the Bloomington stock cen-
ter and reared at room temperature on a standard fly
medium. The fly medium recipe that we used is the follow-
ing: 6.2-g Agar powder (ACROS N. 400400050), 58.8-g Fari-
gel wheat (Westhove N. FMZH1), 58.8-g yeast (Springaline
BA10), 100-ml grape juice, 4.9-ml Propionic acid (Sigma N.
P1386), 26.5 ml of methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate (VWR N.
ALFAA14289.0) solution (400 g/l) in 95% ethanol, and 1-L
water. We used w1118 and yw flies as wildtype. The UAS-
lark RNAi line was obtained from the Transgenic RNAi Pro-
ject (TRiP.JF02783), and the UAS-lark-3HA line was ob-
tained from Bloomington stock center (stock # 7125). The
P-element insertion lines in lark were obtained from Bloom-
ington stock center (stock #15287 and #22604). Oral infec-
tion was performed using a standard protocol as in [13].
Survival was counted every 24 h.
For specific knockdown or overexpression of lark in the
adult gut enterocyte, F1 lines carrying a copy of the
MyoIA-Gal4 and tub-Gal80ts transgenes [51], as well as
one copy of either the UAS-IR or the UAS-ORF was kept
at 18 °C for 3 days post-eclosion, and then moved to 29 °C
for 8 days to activate the UAS transgenes. Flies were sub-
sequently infected with P.e. using the standard oral infec-
tion protocol (OD600 nm of 100 and 1.5% sucrose) [13].
RNA extraction
For the all samples in this study, guts from 30 adult
female flies were freshly dissected in PBS after 4 h
of treatment. RNA extraction was performed using
Trizol
Reagent
(Invitrogen)
using
the
standard
protocol.
RT-qPCR
cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg total RNA using
SuperScript II enzyme (Invitrogen). qPCR experiments
were performed on a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR sys-
tem (Applied Biosystems) using Power SYBR® Green
PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Relative gene ex-
pression was calculated after normalization to the con-
trol RpL32 mRNA.
RNA-seq
Library preparation and sequencing
For
the
w1118
and
Lark
perturbation
experiments,
paired-end Illumina Truseq libraries were generated and
sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 for 75 cycles in
the Gene Expression Core Facility at EPFL. As for the 76
DGRP samples, single-end Illumina Truseq libraries
were sequenced for 100 cycles on an Illumina HiSeq
2500 at the Genomics Technology Platform of the Uni-
versity of Lausanne. All our samples passed quality con-
trol as assessed by FastQC version 0.11.2. For the
paired-end samples, we used cutadapt version 1.8 to re-
move adapter sequences as well as bases with a quality
score inferior to 20.
Mapping to individualized genomes
For each DGRP line, we generated an individualized
fasta genome sequence based on the homozygous vari-
ants in the published Freeze 2 DGRP genotypes and the
Release 5 reference genome. We also generated individu-
alized gene annotations by applying the offsetGTF tool
included in the mmseq package [52] on the Ensembl
BDGP5.25 gene annotation. For each sample, RNASeq
reads were mapped to the respective genome using the
STAR aligner version 2.3.0. Reads for each gene were
counted using HTseq-count version 0.5.4p3. For non-
DGRP samples, we used the reference genome and gene
annotation.
Differential expression
Filtering was performed separately for each experiment.
For the DGRP lines RNA-seq, genes with more than 5
counts in 38 samples were kept. For the w1118 RNA-
seq, genes with more than 5 reads in at least 3 samples
were kept. For the lark RNA-seq, genes with more than
10 reads in at least 3 samples were kept. We used limma
[53] to perform differential expression analysis, specific-
ally the voom [54] function to estimate counts per
million as well as sample weights. To account for intra-
strain correlations in the DGRP samples, we used the
duplicateCorrelation function with strain as a blocking
variable. For the lark experiment, we performed 3 repli-
cates, but realized that two had weak infections as
judged by hierarchical clustering (Additional file 1: Fig-
ure S6a). Thus, we chose one replicate for the down-
stream analyses.
Transcript ratio estimation and comparisons
We used MISO version 0.5.3 to obtain transcript ratios
(PSI values) from each of the individualized genomes and
annotations. We used the Ensembl BDGP 5.25 as annota-
tion. We also extracted the assigned counts for each tran-
script from the MISO outputs. For the detection of genes
with significantly altered isoform ratios after infection, we
Bou Sleiman et al. Genome Biology            (2020) 21:4 
Page 14 of 19
used the rasp package (https://www.isglobal.org/en/web/
guest/statistical-software), a distance-based non-parametric
multivariate approach as described in [15]. We slightly
modified the package script in order to obtain the effect
sizes of infection on the isoform ratios of each gene, which
are normally calculated but not reported. In order to be
kept in the analysis, each isoform must have more than one
read assigned to it in 90% of the samples. We used 10,000
permutations
to
estimate
significance
followed
by
Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control false discovery
rate.
Intron retention analyses
We used available annotations for intron retention ana-
lysis from the Graveley lab [23] to estimate the PSI value
of each event in MISO. Then, we used the miso-
compare function on each sample pair (treated and con-
trol) to detect statistically significant differences due to
infection. Events with a Bayes factor greater than 10 and
a PSI difference greater than 0.2 were considered
significant.
ChIP-seq
RNA polymerase II ChIP-seq
For each condition, 100 w1118 adult female flies were
killed by submerging them in liquid nitrogen. Guts
were dissected on ice and stored at −80 °C. On the
day of the experiments, guts were homogenized in
NE

(15 mM

0.1 mM
EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 350 mM Sucrose, 0.1% Tween-

inhibitor tablet) supplemented with 1% formaldehyde
using a douncer and pestle. After 10 min, crosslinking
was quenched by the addition of Glycine for a final
concentration of 0.125 M. Samples were cleared by
centrifuging for 4 min at 4000 rpm and 4 °C. Samples
were washed twice with ice-cold NE buffer and twice
with ice-cold RIPA buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6,
150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate, 0.5 mM DTT,
0.1% SDS, 1% NP-40, protease inhibitor tablet). Fi-
nally, samples were resuspended in 130 μl RIPA buffer
and sonicated in Covaris E-220 (30 s, Intensity: 175,
Cycles per burst 200, Duty 20%, Water level: 10).
Samples were then cleared by centrifugation for 10
min, at 4 °C and max speed. At this point, 1% of the
total volume was separated as input and stored at
4 °C; then, the remaining amount was diluted 1:5 in
IP Dilution buffer (2.8 ml H2O, 3 μl 10% SDS, 7.2 μl
0.5 M EDTA, 33 μl Triton X-100, 50.1 μl Tris-HCl
pH 8.1, 100.2 μl 5 M NaCl). We then added 1 μg of
antibody (Abcam ab5408) and incubated the sample
overnight at 4 °C on a rotating platform. The next
day, the sample was transferred to a tube containing
50 μl of magnetic beads (M-280 Sheep Anti-Mouse

Buffer
(8.77 ml PBS 1x, 1 ml BSA 1%, 10 μl Triton X-100,
220 μl 45% Fish Gelatin) and the mixture was incu-
bated for 2 h at 4 °C on a magnetic platform. Using
magnetic racks, beads were washed once with Low
Salt Buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1, 150 mM NaCl, 2
mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100), twice with
High Salt Buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1, 500 mM

LiCl Buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1, 250 mM LiCl, 1

(10 mM

pH 8.0,
1 mM

were incubated 10 min at 4 °C on a rotating platform.
After the last wash, beads are resuspended in 500 μl
of Elution Buffer (3.24 mL H2O, 50 μl Tris-HCl pH
7.5 1 M, 10 μl EDTA 0.5 M, 1 mL NaHCO3 0.5 M,
500 μl 10% SDS, 200 μl NaCl 5 M) and the input sam-
ple was supplemented with the same amount. From
then on, both the input and the IP were treated simi-
larly. We first incubated them at 37 °C for 30 min
with 900 rpm shaking in the presence of 7.5 μl RNAse
A 20 mg/ml. We then added 10 μl of Proteinase K
and incubated the sample at 55 °C overnight. The
next day, we added 10 μl of Proteinase K and incu-
bated for 1 h at 45 °C. Samples were then spun down
for 5 min at room temperature and 2000 rpm, finally,
we used 500 μl of samples as starting material for
Qiagen PCR purification kit, following the manufac-
turer’s instructions. We eluted the IP and the input
in 30 μl. We used the Qubit dsDNA HS kit to meas-
ure the DNA load.
Library preparation
Ten nanograms of DNA was transferred to a low bind-
ing tube and completed to 55.5 μl with H2O. We added
3 μl of NEBNext Ultra End Repair/dA-Tailing Module
Enzyme mix and 6.5 μl of Reaction buffer and incubated
each tube at 20 °C for 30 min, then 65 °C for 30 min. The
product of the reaction was purified using the Qiagen
MinElute PCR Purification Kit; elution was made in
12.5 μl of Elution Buffer. For each tube, an adapter with
a different barcode was selected. We used the DNA
Quick ligase kit, using 15 μl of 2× buffer, 1.5 μl of DNA
quick ligase, and 1 μl of adapter hybrid primer. Mixture
was incubated at 22 °C for 30 min. The reaction was
purified using the Qiagen MinElute PCR Purification
Kit; elution was made in 50 μl of Elution Buffer. Samples
were purified using AMPure beads in a 1:1 ratio, washed
twice with 80% EtOH and resuspended in 20 μl of Elu-
tion Buffer. Using 1 μl, we perform a qPCR using the
KAPA SYBR green kit 50 μl total volume to determine
the number of cycle for each samples. We then amplify
each sample by PCR using the KAPA master mix. We

then perform a size selection using AMPure beads, first
using a 0.6:1 ratio and excluding the bound fraction
followed by a 1:1 ratio selection, washing twice with 80%
EtOH and resuspending in 20 μl Elution Buffer. We used

assay and 1 μl to assess the fragment profile using the

Mapping and analysis
Chip-Seq samples were sequenced on an Illumina
Hiseq 2500. The sequencing reads were mapped to
the reference genome using Bowtie2 (--end-to-end
--very-sensitive); then, the counts for every intron re-
tention event (the flanking exons as well as the in-
tron) were counted using the regionCounts function
in the R csaw package [55]. The count data was con-
verted to RPKM and quantile normalized prior to the
analyses. Since the RNA pol II coverage decays from
the 5′ to the 3′ end of a gene, we converted the
RPKM values to the standard normal distribution for
each intron retention event (the flanking exons and
intron) when we were comparing the retained and
the spliced events.
Statistical and computational analyses
Shannon diversity
For each gene, the Shannon diversity was calculated
based on the transcript ratios of its annotated isoforms
using the Vegan R package [56]. This was done for each
RNA-seq sample. The Delta Shannon for each DGRP
line was calculated by subtracting the control Shannon
diversity from the infected one.
Effective length calculations
We first generated tables of transcript, 5′UTR, 3′
UTR, and CDS lengths for each line, considering the
insertions and deletions in those lines. Then, for each
line and condition, we calculated the effective length
of a gene as the sum of the products of the length
and the corresponding isoform ratio (Fig. 3). To ad-
dress whether 3′UTR effective length changes were
due to differential polyadenylation site use versus spli-
cing, we devised a strategy to classify multi-isoform
genes into these two groups. We used simple rules to
decide whether 3′UTRs of that gene (1) can contrib-
ute to diversity in the first place, (2) have the same
number of exons, and (3) share a common start pos-
ition and different end position. Using this strategy,
we obtained three groups of genes (out of a total of
3733 genes with more than one isoform). Splicing:
Genes for which splicing can affect the 3′UTR length
(n = 387). Alternate3Poly: Genes for which an alter-
nate choice of polyadenylation site can affect the
length of the 3′UTR (n = 1138). No annotated diff/
Ambiguous: Genes with either no difference in iso-
form length or ambiguous classification (n = 2208).
We then broke down the 3′UTR effective length
changes as in Fig. 3b by UTR class. For example, if a
gene has more than one isoform, we would first
check if it has diversity in 3′UTR lengths of the dif-
ferent isoforms. Then, we would look at those 3′
UTRs and check if they are encoded by the same
number of exons. If not, then effective length of these
3′UTRs would likely be affected by splicing. If all the
transcripts’ 3′UTRs have the same number of exons,
and these exons share the same start position but dif-
ferent end position, we put the gene in the “Alterna-
te3Poly” category.
sQTL analysis
sQTL analysis was performed using sQTLSeekR [21]
using the transcript ratios and genetic variants 10 kb
around each expressed gene with multiple isoforms.
We performed slight modifications on the package
script in order to extract information about the effect
size of sQTLs which was normally calculated but not
reported.
ESE and ISE analyses
We used a published set of 330 intronic and exonic
splicing enhancers and pattern matching through the
BSgenome and Biostrings R packages to catalogue all
the possible locations of those elements within the
gene bodies of the reference genome. We then calcu-
lated the percentage of sQTLs that overlap with a
predicted element. To assess the overlap expected by
chance, we randomly sampled, 100 times, sets of vari-
ants that are within 10 kb of expressed genes that
have
a
similar
allele
frequency
spectrum
as
the
sQTLs.
RNA-binding motif analyses
We used AME version 4.11.1, from the MEME suite,
to perform enrichment of all binding motifs of RNA
binding
proteins
using
Drosophila-specific
PWM
scores from [25] in introns with increased and de-
creased retention. The same RNA-binding protein can
have multiple RBMs. We used FIMO, also from the
MEME suite, for motif scanning using the same set
of PWMs. Given that the retained introns were poorly
enriched for RBMs and in order to visualize the loca-
tions of motifs in both the introns with increased and
decreased retention, we used a high FDR threshold of
40% to filter the resulting matches and only kept the
motifs that are enriched in the AME results (Add-
itional file 1: Figure S5d,e). For both AME and FIMO
analyses, we used the sequences of introns that do
not

Overlap with uORF
We used supplementary data table 2 from the study of
Zhang and colleagues [30]. We converted coordinates
from R6 to R5 using the Flybase Coordinates Back-
Converter. We only kept uORFs that are less than 201
bp in length which left us with 32,924 out of 37,619. We
looked for any overlap between introns and the uORFs
based on the reference locations; then for each DGRP
line, we split the intron events by the sign of their PSI
value and counted the proportion of those events that
have a uORF. To test for significance, we performed a
paired one-tailed t test between the positive and negative
logit-transformed proportions.
