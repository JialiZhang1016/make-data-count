Abstract
Background: Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is a natural phenomenon of pollen abortion caused by the
interaction between cytoplasmic genes and nuclear genes. CMS is a simple and effective pollination control system,
and plays an important role in crop heterosis utilization. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a vital type of non-coding
RNAs, which play crucial roles in microRNAs (miRNAs) function and post-transcription control. To explore the
expression profile and possible functions of circRNAs in the soybean CMS line NJCMS1A and its maintainer
NJCMS1B, high-throughput deep sequencing coupled with RNase R enrichment strategy was conducted.
Results: CircRNA libraries were constructed from flower buds of NJCMS1A and its maintainer NJCMS1B with three
biological replicates. A total of 2867 circRNAs were identified, with 1009 circRNAs differentially expressed between
NJCMS1A and NJCMS1B based on analysis of high-throughput sequencing. Of the 12 randomly selected circRNAs
with different expression levels, 10 showed consistent expression patterns based on high-throughput sequencing
and quantitative real-time PCR analyses. Tissue specific expression patterns were also verified with two circRNAs by
quantitative real-time PCR. Most parental genes of differentially expressed circRNAs were mainly involved in
biological processes such as metabolic process, biological regulation, and reproductive process. Moreover, 83
miRNAs were predicted from the differentially expressed circRNAs, some of which were strongly related to pollen
development and male fertility; The functions of miRNA targets were analyzed using Gene Ontology (GO) and
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and the target mRNAs were significantly enriched in signal
transduction and programmed cell death. Furthermore, a total of 165 soybean circRNAs were predicted to contain
at least one internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element and an open reading frame, indicating their potential to
encode polypeptides or proteins.
Conclusions: Our study indicated that the circRNAs might participate in the regulation of flower and pollen
development, which could provide a new insight into the molecular mechanisms of CMS in soybean.

Background
Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) is an important oil
and protein crop, but soybean yield is low. Utilization of
heterosis has been proved to be one of the effective
methods to increase crop yield, and cytoplasmic male
sterility (CMS) plays an important role in heterosis
utilization [1]. CMS is a maternally inherited phenotype
caused by the interaction of cytoplasmic genes and nu-
clear genes, which lead to pollen abortion but normal
pistil development [2, 3]. To date, CMS has been ob-
served in over 200 plant species [4] and is often obtained
in wild germplasm or by inter- or intra-subspecies back-
crossing [5]. In soybean, CMS was first reported by
Davis [6], after which many studies on CMS were
conducted [7, 8]. In recent years, transcriptomics [9],
proteomics [10], microRNA [11], and DNA methylation
of CMS have been explored [12], but the function of
circular RNAs (circRNAs) in soybean CMS has not been
reported.
CircRNAs are a class of endogenous noncoding RNAs,
which do not have 5′ caps and 3′ tails and form a ring
structure with covalent bonds [13]. CircRNAs were first
reported based on deep sequencing of RNA by Salzman
et al. [14], which were neglected for decades because
they were considered as transcriptional noise or reverse
transcription PCR artifacts by-product [15]. With the
development of high-throughput sequencing technology
and bioinformatics, circRNAs have been identified in all
domains of life, including eukaryotes [15, 16], archaea
[17], bacteria [18], and viruses [19]. Previous studies
showed that circRNAs were more resistant to degrad-
ation by RNase R than their linear counterparts [20],
and
had
tissue,
cell-type,
and
developmental-stage
specific expression patterns [15, 21, 22]. Li et al. [23]
demonstrated that the circRNAs located in the nucleus
could promote transcription of their parental genes via
specific RNA-RNA interactions, but another recent
study revealed that circRNAs derived from organelle
genome could also regulate gene expression [24]. Fur-
thermore, circRNAs act as miRNA sponges and prevent
them from inhibiting their target mRNAs [25, 26]. Most
recent studies have demonstrated that some circRNAs
can be translated into polypeptides or proteins by
translation initiation element internal ribosome entry
site (IRES) or N6-methyladenosine (m6A) [27, 28].
Although not as comprehensive as in animals, the ex-
ploration of circRNAs in plants is increasing. Differential
expression of circRNAs has been reported in plants, for
example, 27 rice exonic circRNAs were associated with
phosphate starvation responsive expression [16], 163
tomato circRNAs with chilling responsive expression
[29], and 62 wheat circRNAs with dehydration stress
specific
expression
[30].
Moreover,
some
circRNAs
showed time, tissue, species, or developmental-stage
specific expression patterns in plants [16, 24, 31, 32].
Unlike the positive regulation of circRNAs in animals
[23], over-expression of circRNAs in rice and tomato re-
duced expression level of their parental genes [33, 34].
In soybean, a total of 5372 circRNAs were identified, of
which approximately 80% were generated from paralo-
gous genes [35]. Meanwhile, Zhao et al. [35] found that
up-regulation of circRNAs might decrease the activity of
target miRNAs and increase expression of the related
mRNAs.
To explore the expression profile and possible functions
of circRNAs in the soybean CMS line NJCMS1A vs. its
maintainer line NJCMS1B, high-throughput deep sequen-
cing coupled with RNase R enrichment strategy was
conducted. Target miRNAs of differentially expressed
circRNAs and the correlated mRNAs were predicted
using
bioinformatics
methods,
and
their
potential
functions were further analyzed. Our study investi-
gated the possible role of circRNAs in CMS for the
first time, and the results showed that the circRNAs
might participate in the regulation of flower and
pollen development in soybean.
Methods
Plant materials and sample collection
The soybean cytoplasmic male-sterile line NJCMS1A
was developed through consecutive backcross. The culti-
var N8855 was the donor and cultivar N2899 (desig-
nated as NJCMS1B afterwards) was a recurrent parent
[8, 36, 37]. NJCMS1A and NJCMS1B are near-isogenic
lines of isonuclear alloplasmic type with similar nucleus
but different cytoplasm. NJCMS1A and NJCMS1B were
grown in the summer of 2016 at Dangtu Experimental
Station, National Center for Soybean Improvement,
Nanjing
Agricultural
University,
Maanshan,
Anhui,
China. Male sterile plants were identified by observing
dehiscence of anthers, germination rate of pollen, and
morphological traits of plants at maturity. Because it is
difficult to determine development stage of pollen based
on flower bud size in soybean, during the flowering
period, the flower buds of different sizes were collected
from NJCMS1A or NJCMS1B plants and mixed, with
three biological replicates per line. Meanwhile, roots,
stems and leaves of soybean were also collected at the
flowering period with three biological replicates. The
tissues were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored at −80 °C for further use.
Total RNA extraction and RNase R treatment
Total
RNA
from
flower
buds
of
NJCMS1A
and
NJCMS1B lines was extracted using the RNAprep pure
Plant Kit (Qiagen, DEU) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol, DNA contamination was removed using the
DNase I contained in the Kit. For RNase R-treated total
Chen et al. BMC Genomics  (2018) 19:663 
Page 2 of 14
RNA samples, the purified DNaseI-treated total RNA
was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with 3 units RNase R
per μg of total RNA (Epicentre, Shanghai, CN). RNA
was subsequently purified using an RNase MinElute
Cleaning Kit (Qiagen, DEU). To obtain accurate and
sufficient transcriptome data, RNA from three biological
replicates
of
NJCMS1A
and
NJCMS1B
lines
were
sequenced.
CircRNA library construction and sequencing
rRNA-depleted RNAs in 5 μg RNA per sample was ob-
tained using the Epicentre Ribo-zero™rRNA Removal
Kit (Epicentre, USA) and were further treated with
RNase R (Epicentre, USA) for Trizol extraction. Sequen-
cing
libraries
were
prepared
using
NEBNext
Ultra
Directional RNA LibraryPrep Kit (NEB, USA) following
manufacturer’s instructions. The libraries were prelimin-
arily quantified by Qubit and diluted to 1 ng/ul. The
insert size of the libraries was detected by Agilent 2100/
Caliper, which was expected to be distributed around
250~ 300 bp. The effective concentration of the libraries
was accurately quantified by qRT-PCR, and the effective
concentration was greater than 2 nM to ensure the
libraries quality. Briefly, fragmentation was carried out
using divalent cations under elevated temperature in
NEBNext
First-strand
Synthesis
Reaction
Buffer.
First-strand
cDNA
was
synthesized
using
random
hexamer primer and M-MuLV reverse transcriptase
(RNaseH). Second-strand cDNA synthesis was subse-
quently performed using DNA Polymerase I and RNase
H. In the reaction buffer, dTTP in dNTPs was replaced
by
dUTP.
Remaining
overhangs
were
blunted
via
exonuclease/polymerase. After adenylation of 3′ ends of
DNA fragments, NEBNext Adaptor with hairpin loop
structure was ligated for hybridization. In order to
obtain cDNA fragments of 150–200 bp in length, the
library fragments were purified with the AMPure XP
system (Beckman Coulter, Beverly, USA). Subsequently,
3
μl
USER
Enzyme
(NEB,
USA)
was
added
to
adaptor-ligated cDNA of 150–200 bp and kept at 37 °C
for 15 min followed by 5 min at 95 °C before PCR. PCR
was performed with Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymer-
ase, universal PCR primer, and index (X) primer. Finally,
the library was purified (AMPure XP system) and then
qualified
by
the
Agilent
Bioanalyzer
2100
system.
Clustering of the index-coded samples was performed
on a cBot Cluster Generation System using HiSeq PE
Cluster Kit v4 cBot (Illumina) according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions. After cluster generation, the libraries
were sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform and
125 bp paired-end reads were generated. Library con-
struction and sequencing were carried out by Novogene
(Novogene, Beijing, China).
Identification of circRNAs and differential expression
analysis
Raw data (raw reads in fastq format) was first processed
by a custom perl script. Sequence reads with adapter,
ploy-N, and low-quality were eliminated. The remaining
reads were used for read quality and GC content estima-
tion, and downstream calculation. Soybean reference
genome and gene annotation were downloaded from the
website at https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/pz/portal.html#.
The index of the reference genome was built using Bow-
tie v2.0.6, paired-end reads were aligned to the reference
genome (soybean genome version 2.0 in Phytozome)
using TopHat v2.0.9. 20-mers from 5′ and 3′ end of the
unmapped reads were extracted and aligned independ-
ently to reference sequences using Bowtie v2.0.6. Anchor
sequences were extended by find_circ [15], such that the
complete read was aligned and the breakpoints were
flanked
by
GU/AG
splice
sites.
Subsequently,
the
back-spliced reads with at least two supporting reads
were annotated as circRNAs.
Expression level of circRNAs was normalized by tran-
script per million (TPM) through the following criteria
[38]:
Normalized
expression = (mapped
reads)/(total
reads) * 1000000. Differential expression between two
groups was performed using DESeq2 (version 1.6.3) [39].
Differentially expressed circRNAs were identified with
the cutoff threshold of |log2 (fold-changes)| ≥2 based on
the method used by Wang et al. [30] and Liu et al. [31].
Prediction of miRNA targets of circRNAs, mRNA targets of
miRNA, and annotation of functions
miRNA binding sites of differentially expressed cir-
cRNAs were predicted by psRobot_tar in psRobot
[40]. Meanwhile, the circRNA-miRNA interaction net-
work was delineated by Cytoscape [41]. The obtained
miRNAs were used to predict the target mRNAs by
psRobot with default parameters [40]. The parental genes
of differentially expressed circRNAs and the predicted tar-
get mRNAs were classified into different functional pro-
cesses based on Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment
using the Web Gene Ontology Annotation Plot (WEGO)
[42] and agriGO [43, 44], respectively. The KOBAS [45]
was used for KEGG pathways enrichment analysis. The
gene annotation of A. thaliana at http://www.arabidopsi-
s.org/ was used to define functions of homologous genes
in soybean.
PCR amplification and sanger sequencing
To validate the soybean circRNAs identified in this study,
a set of 12 differentially expressed circRNAs were ampli-
fied with divergent primer. As a control, a pair of conver-
gent
primers
were
designed
for
gma-circRNA0002
(Additional file 1). All primers were synthesized by Invi-
trogen (Shanghai, China). The total and RNase R-treated

RNA of each sample were used as templates. PCR prod-
ucts were separated using agarose gel, and each band
was excised and purified using the AxyPrep DNA Gel
Extraction
Kit
(Axygen,
Suzhou,
China)
for
Sanger-sequencing.
Quantitative real-time PCR validation
Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was carried
out
to
validate
differential
expressional
levels
of
circRNAs. Divergent primers were designed in order
to obtain amplicon from circle template (Additional
file 1). According to the instruction of the iScript
Select cDNA Synthesis Kit (BIO-RAD, USA), 1 μg of
the
total
RNA
untreated
with
RNase
R
was
reverse-transcribed with random primers. Expression
of circRNAs was quantified using the iTaq Universal
SYBR
Green
Supermix
(BIO-RAD,
USA)
on
the
Bio-Rad CFX96 machine (CFX96 Touch, BIO-RAD,
USA). All real-time PCR assays were performed with
three biological replicates, and the expression of the
housekeeping gene GADPH was used as a reference
for data normalization. The qRT-PCR aliquot con-
tained 2 μL cDNA, 0.6 μL of each upstream and
downstream primers (10 μM), 10 μL Takara SYBR
Premix Ex Taq, and 6.8 μL RNase-free ddH2O and
performed with an initial denaturation at 95 °C for
30 s, followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 5 s, 60 °C for
30 s. The amplification curve and melting curve were
examined
to
evaluate
specific
amplification.
The
circRNAs relative expression levels (log2 values) were
calculated using the 2–ΔΔCt method. Student’s t-test
was performed to compare differences of circRNAs
expression between NJCMS1A and NJCMS1B. The
probability threshold of significance was P < 0.05.
Protein-coding potential prediction of circRNAs
The IRES element is required to initiate translation of
a mRNA sequence without a 5′-cap structure [46]. If
a circRNA has at least one IRES element, it may be
able to encode a protein. To predict the IRES ele-
ments in soybean circRNAs, we blasted sequences of
the circRNAs to all the IRES sequences in the website
(http://iresite.org/) at an E-value < 0.05 [47]. To pre-
dict the ORFs of predictive circRNAs, we used the
prediction algorithm at the website (https://github.-
com/kadenerlab/cORF_pipeline).
Briefly,
the
longest
ORF spanning the circRNA junction was selected for
further analysis. The possible coding products of the
circRNAs with protein-coding potential were used to
predict the conserved domains using the Conserved
Domain
Database
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi).
Results and discussion
Identification of circRNAs in soybean
Total amount of sequence for each RNA libraries was ≥9
Gb with Q20 ≥93%, Q30 ≥85%, and an error rate ≤0.05
(Table 1), the depth and accuracy of high quality sequence
was sufficient for subsequent analysis.
A total of 2867 circRNAs were identified, which in-
cluded 1722 from NJCMS1B and 1643 from NJCMS1A
(Fig. 1a, Additional file 2). Among them, 452 (15.8%)
were derived from exons of a single protein-coding gene
(exonic circRNAs), 821 (28.6%) from introns (intronic
circRNAs), 293 (10.2%) from exons and introns of one
or
more
genes
(exon-intron
circRNAs),
and
1301
(45.4%) from intergenic regions (intergenic circRNAs)
(Fig. 1b). CircRNAs primarily derived from exons in
several plants have been reported, e.g. 5152 (85.7%)
circRNAs in A. thaliana [16], 615 (72.0%) in tomato
[29], and 1453 (93.7%) in maize [48]. However, only
2494 (46.4%) exonic circRNAs were identified in soy-
bean by Zhao et al. [35], which was similar to our result.
The length of circRNAs in this study ranged from 150 to
44,756 bp, but most (92.8%) were < 2000 bp (Fig. 1c).
The length distribution of soybean circRNAs in this
study was similar to that reported by Zhao et al. [35].
Additionally, the sequence alignment between the cir-
cRNAs inform this study and previous study (Zhao et al.
[35]) using blastn indicated that only 78 circRNAs were
homologous (Additional file 3) at e-value <1e−5 and
identity > 85%. The small proportion of homologous
circRNAs in these two studies might be associated with tis-
sue specific expression pattern of circRNA (Additional file 4)
and use of different circRNAs prediction software.
Besides, the number of circRNAs in different chromo-
somes and the densities of circRNAs in different
chromosomal regions were also different (Fig. 1d).
Expression profiling of circRNAs and qRT-PCR validation
A total of 1009 circRNAs with at least two-fold (log2)
change of expression level between NJCMS1A and
NJCMS1B were identified by high-throughput sequencing.
Of these, a total of 360 circRNAs were up-regulated, 649
circRNAs
were
down-regulated
in
NJCMS1A
vs.
NJCMS1B (Additional file 5).
The back splicing sites and expression profiles of the
12 randomly selected from 1009 circRNAs were further
experimentally validated. We treated total RNA samples
with RNase R to verify the special stability (resistance to
exonuclease-mediated degradation) of circRNAs and
eliminated interference from linear RNA. Divergent
primers were designed to guarantee that amplifications
were from circular templates and a pair of convergent
primers for gma-circRNA0002 were designed as a con-
trol. Total RNA samples and RNase R-treated samples
were used as reaction templates to amplify circRNAs. As
Chen et al. BMC Genomics  (2018) 19:663 
Page 4 of 14
a result, all 12 pairs of divergent primers yielded amplifica-
tion products with the expected length from cDNAs that
with and without RNase R treatment. To demonstrate that
the amplification products from the divergent primers
were derived from the corresponding circRNAs and span-
ning the junction sites, we collected the amplification
products for further detection by Sanger sequencing (Fig. 2
and Additional file 6). As shown in Fig. 3, among the 12
random-selected circRNAs, 10 showed consistent expres-
sion patterns with RNA-seq results. The coincidence rate
between qRT-PCR and RNA-seq was 83.3%. Two incon-
sistent expression of circRNAs candidates (gma-circ2468
and gma-circ2848) may be caused by the low expression
levels of the two circRNAs.

Tissue specific expression patterns validation by qRT-PCR
Previous studies showed that circRNAs were tissue-
preferentially expressed [15, 24]. To verify this, two
highly
expressed
circRNAs
(gma-circRNA0002
and
gma-circRNA2483) based on the high throughput se-
quencing were selected for qRT-PCR analysis, these two
circRNAs were expressed only in leaves and flower buds
of NJCMS1A and NJCMS1B, but not in roots and stems
(Fig. 4). The expression level of gma-circRNA0002 was
only significantly different in the flower buds, while the
expression levels of gma-circRNA2483 were significantly
different
in
the
leaves
and
flower
buds
between
NJCMS1A and NJCMS1B.
Functional categorization of parental genes of
differentially expressed circRNAs
It has been reported that circRNAs could regulate ex-
pression of their parental genes [33, 34]. To understand
the possible functions of circRNAs in CMS of soybean,
the
parental
genes
of
the
differentially
expressed
circRNAs were predicted. A total of 545 parental genes
were obtained from the 1009 differentially expressed
circRNAs. GO classification showed that these genes are
involved in a wide range of biological processes, such as
in metabolic process (GO:0008152), biological regulation

and
cellular
process
(GO:0009987)
(Fig. 5). Interestingly, a fraction of parental genes was clas-
sified into the categories of reproduction (GO:0000003)
and reproductive
process
(GO:0022414). Among the
cellular
components,
cell
(GO:0005623),
cell
part
(GO:0044464), and organelle (GO:0043226) accounted for
a large proportion. In the molecular functions, the two
main categories were binding (GO:0005488) and catalytic
(GO:0003824). GO analysis of the parental genes showed
that the differentially expressed circRNAs from NJCNS1A
and NJCMS1B were associated with various functions in
different biological processes, cellular components, and
molecular function, indicating that circRNAs may play
an important role in the fertility of soybean. KEGG
pathway
analysis
identified
7
pathways
including
valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation, selenocom-
pound
metabolism,
RNA
transport,
synthesis
and
degradation of ketone bodies, ascorbate and aldarate
metabolism, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, and por-
phyrin and chlorophyll metabolism (Additional file 7).
These pathways are mainly related to amino acid deg-
radation and material metabolism.
Putative functions of parental genes of differentially
expressed circRNAs in flower development and male
fertility
Based on the gene annotation of A. thaliana, the func-
tion of many parental genes were related to flower devel-
opment and male fertility. We randomly enumerated 20
parental genes (Table 2) and selected four of them to de-
scribe their functions in detail. Glyma.06G173500, the
parental gene of gma-circRNA0717, was a homolog of
the Glucan Synthase-Like 8 (GSL8) gene in A. thaliana.
GSL8 and Glucan Synthase-Like 10 (GSL10) were two
members of the A. thaliana GSL gene family, which are
independently required for male gametophyte develop-
ment and plant growth. Experiments showed that GSL8
and GSL10 T-DNA insertions led to pollen sterility [49].
GLS8 was believed to be involved in the synthesis of cell
wall component callose [50]. It was hypothesized that
gma-circRNA0717 may play a vital role in male gameto-
phyte development. Glyma.13G230500, the parental gene
of gma-circRNA1856, was an ortholog of the maternal
effect embryo arrest 18 (MEE18) gene in A. thaliana. Mu-
tation of MEE18 may affect pollen gametogenesis, pollen
germination, pollen tube growth, polarity or guidance, and
pollen tube-embryo sac interactions or fertilization [51].
X-ray induced 1 gene (XRI1) was a novel DNA repair fac-
tor and was essential for male and female meiosis, and
homozygous XRI1 mutants caused complete sterility in A.
thaliana [52]. In this study, Glyma.18G164900, the paren-
tal gene of gma-circRNA2481, was a homolog of the XRI1
gene. Glyma.18G118100, the parental gene of gma-
circRNA2454, was a homolog of squalene epoxidase 1
(SQE1) gene in A. thaliana. Previous studies showed that
SQE1 mutants displayed severe growth defects in A. thali-
ana, including short stature, short roots, and complete in-
fertility [53]. We speculated that differences in circRNAs
expression levels may influence the functions of pollen
and male gametophytes, and result in CMS in NJCMS1A
by interacting with their parental genes.
Characterization of binding miRNAs of differentially
expressed circRNAs
CircRNAs have been reported to act as miRNA sponges
regulating gene expression [25]. To verify if circRNAs

potential binding sites of miRNAs of the differentially
expressed circRNAs. We observed that 72 differentially
expressed circRNAs, of which 28 were up-regulated and
44
were
down-regulated,
contained
83
predicted
circRNA-binding miRNAs. Of these circRNAs, only 24
had two to four miRNA binding sites (Additional file 8).
Based on the predicted results, a circRNA-miRNA inter-
action network was delineated by Cytoscape (Fig. 6).
The results showed that a single circRNA could target
different miRNAs; for example, gma-circRNA0534 tar-
geted to 16 miRNAs. Meanwhile, a single miRNA could
be
targeted
by
diverse
circRNAs.
For
instance,
gma-miR1533 was targeted by 27 circRNAs.
Among
the
predicted
miRNAs,
three
miRNAs
(gma-miR169e, gma-miR4349, and gma-miR4993) were
differentially expressed in our previous study [11]. In
addition, we found that some miRNAs, such as miR156,
miR162, miR169, and miR172, were important for pollen
development and male fertility in soybean. miR156 is
one of the highly conserved miRNA families, which was
first reported in A. thaliana [54]. Squamosa promoter
binding like (SPL) family proteins are involved in almost
all physiological and biochemical processes such as mor-
phogenesis, development stage transition, sporulation,
flower and fruit development, external stress response,
and hormone signal transduction [55]. Previous studies
showed that miR156 regulated the development stage
transition [56], flowering process [57], fertility mainten-
ance [58], and fruit ripening [59] in plants by regulating
members of the SPL family. Gma-circRNA0888, gma-
circRNA1395, and gma-circRNA1746 could all target
gma-miR156aa and gma-miR156z, which are members
of miR156 family and probably involved in flower
development.
Furthermore,
gma-circRNA1001
was
predicted to target gma-miR162a, gma-miR162b, and
gma-miR162c. NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogen-
ase
(NADP-ICDH)
was
targeted
by
gma-miR162a,
gma-miR162b,
and
gma-miR162c
according
to
the
degradome analysis performed prior by NJCMS1A and
NJCMS1B [11]. NADPH is a key cofactor in the cellular
redox homeostasis, and is essential in the metabolism of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) [60]. In A. thaliana,
NADP-ICDH activity is regulated by molecules involved
in ROS, including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) [61]. Our
previous study showed that these three miRNAs had no
significant differences in expression levels between the
NJCMS1A and NJCMS1B, but the target gene NAD-
P-ICDH was down-regulated in NJCMS1A as revealed
by qRT-PCR analysis [11]. The decreased NADPH level

may result in significant ROS accumulation and male
sterility in soybean. Moreover, gma-miR169e was tar-
geted by gma-circRNA1393, and gma-miR169e could
target dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3), an important
part of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Pyru-
vate dehydrogenase complex is a critical pathway that
supports energy generation for pollen and pollen
tube growth [62]. In our previous study, qRT-PCR
analysis

that

gene

[11].

was

to

gam-miR172j, which could target Glyma.01 g188400,
the homolog of the APETALA2 (AP2) of A. thaliana.
In A. thaliana, miR172 could control flowering time
and floral organ formation by regulating expression
of the AP2-like transcription factor. A previous study
indicated
that
over-expression
of
miR172
caused
flower development abnormalities, and its phenotype
was similar to ap2 mutants, leading to abnormal
gametophyte development [63].

Functional annotation of predicted target mRNAs
To further explore the role of circRNAs in CMS in soy-
bean, the 83 binding miRNAs of differentially expressed
circRNAs were used to predict their possible target
mRNAs by psRobot with the default parameters. In total,
1166 target mRNAs were predicted and further used for
functional analysis (Additional file 8). A direct acyclic
graph (DAG) of biological processes was obtained using
the agriGO online server (Fig. 7). The DAG can indicate
submitted terms and the inter-relationships between
terms. From this figure, we could identify several
pathways with significant enrichment, especially those
involved in signal transduction and programmed cell
death (PCD). A previous study showed that pollen devel-
opment
depended
on
the
interaction
of
multiple
signaling pathways, in which calmodulin was a key
element [64]. Disruption of signaling pathways might
cause abnormal pollen development, resulting in male
sterility in soybean. In addition, PCD in plants is a
cellular process similar to apoptosis, which contains
fragmentation of nuclear DNA and is controlled by
mitochondrion-driven signals [3]. Plant PCD plays a role
in development processes such as senescence, seed ger-
mination, organ development, root tip elongation, xylem
and aerenchyma formation, and disease resistance [65].
The development of plant male gametophytes in anthers
requires cooperative interactions between sporophytic
(anther wall) and gametophytic (microspore) cells as well
as proper PCD-controlled cellular degeneration of the
tapetum and the anther wall tissue [66]. Therefore,
Fig. 7 A direct acyclic graph (DAG) illustrating the biological process category generated from the Gene Ontology (GO) annotation of the
predicted target miRNAs. The nodes in the image are classified into ten levels, which are associated with corresponding specific colors. The
smaller of the term’s adjusted p-value, the more significant statistically, and the node’s color is darker and redder. Inside the box of the significant
terms, the information include: GO term, adjusted p-value, GO description, item number mapping the GO in the query list and background, and
total number of the query list and background. Different arrow types are also shown in the annotation diagram

Page 10 of 14
premature or delayed PCD leads to abnormality of
pollen development and tapetal function, and even male
sterility [67–69]. For example, the PET1-CMS cytoplasm
in sunflower causes premature PCD of the tapetal cells,
which then leads to abnormal anther development [70].
The KEGG pathway analysis was also used to further ex-
plore the function of predicted target mRNAs of differ-
entially expressed circRNAs. The target mRNAs were
significantly enriched in six pathways: beta-Alanine
metabolism, fatty acid degradation, lysine degradation,
ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, limonene and pi-
nene degradation, and mRNA surveillance pathway
(Table 3). Several studies have shown that in most
plant species, the contents of amino acids, proteins,
and soluble sugars in male sterile lines were lower
than those in their maintainer lines [71, 72]. In this
study, the pathways of amino acid degradation and
material
metabolism
may
be
important
causes
of
CMS in soybean. GO categories and KEGG pathway
analyses
showed
that
a
large
number
of
target
mRNAs were involved in pollen development and
male fertility, which implied that the differentially
expressed circRNAs might play an important role in
CMS of soybean.
Prediction of protein-coding potential of soybean circRNAs
Recent studies have demonstrated that some circRNAs
can be translated into polypeptides or proteins by trans-
lation initiation element internal ribosome entry site
(IRES) [27]. To verify whether soybean circRNAs have a
similar function, we predicted the protein-coding potential
by blasting sequences of the circRNAs to all the IRES se-
quences at the website. A total of 165 soybean circRNAs
contained at least one IRES element and an open reading
frame (Additional file 9), which might have protein-coding
potential. Furthermore, conserved domains of the possible
protein-coding products were predicted by Conserved
Domain
Database (Additional file 10) [73], which
might have important functions. Recent studies have
shown that the protein-coding products of circRNAs
can influence the function of their parental genes by
interacting directly or indirectly with them [74, 75].
In this study, some parental genes of circRNAs with
protein-coding potential were associated with flower and
pollen development. For example, gma-circRNA0736 was
predicted to encode an 81- amino acid protein, and its
parental gene was a homolog of VERNALIZATION
INDEPENDENCE 4 (VIP4) in A. thaliana. The VIP4
mutants could cause slightly early flowering and variable
fertility under standard growth conditions [76]. Gma-
circRNA1793 was predicted to encode a 154-amino acid
protein, and its parental gene was a homolog of no pollen
germination related 2 (NPGR2) in A. thaliana. The
NPGR2 encodes a calmodulin-binding protein that is
essential for pollen germination [77]. The protein-coding
products of these circRNAs may affect flower and pollen
development in soybean by affecting the function of the
parental genes.
Conclusion
In this study, a total 2867 circRNAs, of which 1009 were
differentially expressed between the soybean CMS line
NJCMS1A and its maintainer NJCMS1B, were identified
by high-throughput deep sequencing. Tissue specific ex-
pression patterns were verified by quantitative real-time
PCR. The parental genes of differentially expressed
circRNAs were mainly enriched in biological processes
such as metabolic process, biological regulation, and
reproductive process. A large number of parental genes
were related to flower development and male fertility. A
total of 83 binding miRNAs were predicted among the
differentially
expressed
circRNAs,
which
included
well-known flower and pollen development-related miR-
NAs. The target mRNAs predicted for the 83 binding
miRNAs were significantly enriched in signal transduc-
tion and programmed cell death. A total of 165 soybean
circRNAs contained at least one IRES element and an
open reading frame (ORF), indicating their potential to
encode polypeptides or proteins. Our study indicated
that circRNAs might participate in the regulation of
flower and pollen development, which could provide a
new insight into the molecular mechanisms of CMS in
soybean.
