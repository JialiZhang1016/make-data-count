ABSTRACT Social insects, such as ants, termites, and honeybees, have evolved sophisticated societies
where collaboration and division of labor enhance survival of the whole colony, and are thus considered
‘‘superorganisms’’. Historically, studying behaviors involving large groups under natural conditions posed
significant challenges, often leading to experiments with a limited number of organisms under artificial
laboratory conditions that incompletely reflected the animals’ natural habitat. A promising approach to
exploring animal behaviors, beyond observation, is using robotics that produce stimuli to interact with
the animals. However, their application has predominantly been constrained to small groups in laboratory
conditions. Here we present the design choices and development of a biocompatible robotic system
intended to integrate with complete honeybee colonies in the field, enabling exploration of their collective
thermoregulatory behaviors via arrays of thermal sensors and actuators. We tested the system’s ability
to capture the spatiotemporal signatures of two key collective behaviors. A 121-day observation revealed
thermoregulation activity of the broodnest area during the foraging season, followed by clustering behavior
during winter. Then we demonstrated the system’s ability to influence the colony by guiding a cluster of
bees along an unnatural trajectory, via localized thermal stimuli emitted by two robotic frames. These results
showcase a system with the capability to experimentally modulate honeybee colonies from within, as well
as to unobtrusively observe their dynamics over extended periods. Such biohybrid systems uniting complete
societies of thousands of animals and interactive robots can be used to confirm or challenge the existing
understanding of complex animal collectives.

I. INTRODUCTION
With a brain merely the size of a small grain of sand (1 mm3),
honeybees nevertheless demonstrate complex behaviors [1],
[2]. Honeybee colonies function as a superorganism [3], a col-

level, guiding individual members to operate in a coordinated

manner, akin to the cells or organs in a body. The cooperation
between individuals increases the chances of reproduction
and survival [4]. For instance, these collaborations can
be seen in collective behaviors, where a group is more
efficient than a solitary individual. Such collective behaviors
are often interpreted to be ‘‘swarm-intelligent’’ behaviors,
arising as emergent effects of many interacting individual
behaviors. These mechanisms are not only interesting for
understanding natural swarm systems, but often also sources

of inspiration for novel technological manifestations of
these principles [5]. Examples of highly relevant collective
behaviors are diverse within honeybees, most notably in their
foraging decision-making [6] and in their thermoregulatory
behaviors [7], or in various mechanisms of division of
labor by task specialization [8]. Interestingly, these collective
behaviors mostly emerge without any leader or orchestrator,
making superorganisms (colonies) prominent self-organized
biological systems [9], [10], [11], which are fertile ground
for intriguing research questions. Several still unanswered
questions are: how do such colonies achieve highly sophis-
ticated behavioral patterns and collaborate towards specific
goals? How is this capability based on the information flows
inside the community? Which communication pathways are
relevant to achieve the observed collective decision-making?
However, investigating collective behaviors within densely
populated colonies presents inherent challenges often leading
to experiments of limited duration or conducted in settings
that deviate significantly from the animals’ natural condi-
tions. A modern approach to investigating these intriguing
collective dynamics that addresses some of these difficulties
involves creating biohybrid societies in which artificial agents
(robots) collaborate with natural agents (animals) [12], [13].
Through the establishment of an interaction pathway between
these two distinct entities [14], researchers can explore
the intricacies of collective intelligence, communication,
and the emergence of complex behaviors in superorganism
colonies.
Our aim is to develop a biohybrid society for studying
collective thermoregulatory behaviors of the honeybee.
To achieve this objective, we developed a biocompatible
robot that can be embedded within a bee colony, and is
capable of sensing and generating thermal stimuli over
timescales that match these long-running behaviors of
interest. The purpose of this paper is to present a detailed
technical perspective on the development and validation of
this robotic system.
A. CHALLENGES IN STUDYING SOCIAL ANIMALS
One of the main challenges of studying honeybee societies,
and in fact most social animals, lies in the difficulty of
emulating an appropriate social context where group-living
animals can be investigated without overly disturbing their
natural behavior. Experiments in environments that differ
significantly from their natural habitats might miss vital
biotic and abiotic cues, like pheromones or light conditions,
essential for influencing their group dynamics. Additionally,
using only a small number of animals, due to experimental
apparatus constraints, can also bias results since individual
behaviors often depend on interactions with nestmates [13].
Moreover, classes of animal behaviors can unfold over
different temporal patterns, indicating the need for multi-
timescale studies [15], [16]. If specific behaviors require
observations or interactions to be performed at short intervals,
or over very long time spans, certain studies might be infea-
sible in setups lacking the required sophistication. Lastly,
investigating complex behaviors might require a closed-loop
interaction sequence, where the subsequent stimuli depend
on an animal’s response to preceding ones. Achieving
this dynamic interplay using traditional techniques, where
states or parameters are manually adjusted, might be
impractical [17].
B. ROBOTICS IN BEHAVIORAL BIOLOGY
The use of robots that interact with animals is a recent
methodology for behavioral biology, or ethology, that
attempts to overcome some of the above challenges [14].
Modern robotics, bolstered by advances in technology, can
actuate quickly, can sense a wide range of variables, can
track multiple parameters at high rates, can be programmed
to execute sequences of actions at many levels of com-
plexity, and tirelessly perform repetitive tasks. Historically,
ethological research has embraced pioneering techniques,
setting the stage for contemporary interactive robotic studies
in social animal research [20]. A notable early study by
Nobel Prize laureate Nikolaas Tinbergen in 1950 employed
a simple lure to investigate the feeding behavior of the
herring gull [21], seeding the approach of presenting stimuli
to animals with idealized mimics. Fast forward a few decades,
the use of robotics in behavioral studies, inspired by this
approach, expanded. For instance, Michelsen et al. utilized a
mechanical honeybee mimic, which performed 15 Hz lateral
oscillations in a repeating loop, in an attempt to decipher
the intricacies of the waggle dance communication [22].
Similarly, Halloy et al. introduced autonomous robots into
cockroach groups, and intriguingly, the insects perceived
these robots as their kin [12], finding that the behavioral
program of the robots, and inclusion of pheromones were key
to enable the investigation.
While robotics in behavioral biology might seem nascent,
a growing body of research showcases successful robotic
integrations in experiments. For example, a ‘‘cyborg’’
approach, where electrodes are inserted into the animal’s
nervous system, has been used to study insect locomotion,
such as beetles [23] and locusts [24], as well as robotic
navigation using an animal’s sensory apparatus such as
antennae of moths [25]. An alternative approach, central to
robotics investigating social interactions, is to present stimuli
externally, that is, in a non-invasive manner. Robotics have
been developed to interact with a variety of species, including
vertebrates such as ducks [26], chickens [27], frogs [28],
electric fish [29], zebrafish [30], [31], and rummy-nose
tetra fish [32]; and invertebrates such as cockroaches [12],
ants [33], stag beetles [34], crickets [35], flies [36], [37],
and honeybees [22], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43],
underscoring the transformative potential of robotics in the
domain [44]. Examining the results obtained with robotics
that interact with honeybees more closely, the works have
covered several important social behaviors using a variety
of cues. These include: investigating the waggle dance by

such as wing flapping [22], [41]; information exchange

the potential for aggregating small groups of bees with
vibrational cues, generated by a distributed set of static
robots [39], [43].
Generally, such robot-animal interaction relies on the
robotic elements generating cues or signals that are perceived
by the animals and consequently have a modulating effect on
the animal behavior. It is essential to identify an appropriate
interaction pathway to ensure that the generated stimuli
suit the specific organism and behavior being studied [14].
For example, to stimulate motion, two common approaches
are the use of miniature mobile robots [12], [34], [35],
and gantry-style setups that move a lure in a constrained
space [22], [33], [41], which may be hidden from view [36].
Many different factors have been used in investigations by
robots, including visual appearance [32], [45], [46], auditory
signals [27], [28], substrate-born vibrations [43], odors [12],
[33], [34], [35], [36], or thermal cues, as employed in studies
with honeybees.
The studies mentioned have contributed to ethology using
robotic systems. However, it is important to note that the
majority of these investigations have been conducted under
laboratory conditions, involving small numbers of animals
and over relatively limited timescales. Robots have been
deployed in natural habitats to observe animal behaviors on
land [47], in water [48], and in the air [49], [50]. These studies
were primarily focused on passive observation, aiming to
minimize disturbances to animal behavior through techniques
such as camouflage [47] and biomimicry [48]. While this
approach addresses the limitations of artificial environments
and small group sizes, it does not attempt to generate any
stimuli to interact with animals or deliberately induce specific
behaviors.
C. COLLECTIVE THERMOREGULATION IN HONEYBEES
Honeybees continually engage in a set of collective ther-
moregulatory behaviors vital for the colony’s survival [18].
Honeybees have developed efficient strategies to regulate the
thermal conditions of their nest in various scenarios. Unlike
most insects that hibernate during winter in temperate cli-
mates, honeybee colonies remain active within the hive [51].
When ambient temperatures are low, the colony forms a
cohesive self-organized ‘‘winter cluster’’ to produce and
sustain temperatures at safe levels, optimizing the use of the
limited stores collected during the warmer months (Fig. 1b)
[52]. With the onset of the foraging season, marked by
warmer temperatures and longer daylight, the queen begins
laying up to 2000 eggs per day [53] to produce the next
generation of workers and drones [54]. The cells filled with
eggs form the broodnest, which requires a strictly regulated
temperature for the healthy development of the bees [19],
[55], [56]. Throughout the developmental stages of the brood
worker bees maintain broodnest homeostasis, sometimes
raising temperatures through metabolic heat produced by
activating their flight muscles without moving their wings
[51] or cooling the brood areas [57], [58].
D. CONTRIBUTIONS
Despite the vast efforts to date, many gaps remain in the
knowledge of thermoregulation in insects [59]. The integra-
tion of robotic systems into animal colonies may provide a
new approach to studying collective thermoregulation: By
using robotic systems aiming to generate stimuli that the
animals perceive as signals from their own colony members,
we could enable a more controlled, detailed observation of
responses over long timescales.
In this work, we detail the design and validation of an
interactive robotic system tailored to study the collective ther-
moregulatory behaviors of honeybee colonies from within
their hives. Drawing inspiration from recent methodolo-
gies [14], [60], we devised a stationary robotic system capable
of mixing with complete honeybee colonies and compatible
with scientific and agricultural hives (Fig. 1). After empiri-
cally characterizing the sensing and actuation functionalities
of the system (Sec. II), we performed two experiments with
animal groups (Sec. III). The first experiment confirmed the
system’s capability to provide high-fidelity observations of
thermoregulatory behaviors during warm and cold seasons.
The second experiment validated the thermal actuators’
capabilities to modulate the collective position of thousands
of bees. The system was previously presented in the context of
research on winter clusters [40]. In contrast, the current paper
presents a technical perspective on the design choices and
the development process, resulting in a biocompatible tool.
Here, we provide new experimental results that characterize
the system performance and illustrate its functionality for
investigating thermoregulation over extended periods of time.
The experiments with complete colonies demonstrate that
the robotic system is a versatile tool applicable in multiple
seasons such as investigating the broodnest in summer, and
clustering in winter. These results reveal the potential of
the biohybrid robotic system in future studies to confirm or
challenge existing understanding in collective thermobiology.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows:
Section II presents the specification and detailed design of
the robotic system. It also provides characterization data
for the sensor and actuator subsystems. Section III presents
experimental results involving complete animal colonies.
Section IV discusses the system and results in a broader
context. Finally, Section V provides methodological details
on animals and collecting and processing experimental data.
II. THE DESIGN OF AN INTERACTIVE ROBOTIC SYSTEM
TO EXPLORE HONEYBEE THERMOBIOLOGY
Collective behaviors within a bee colony predominantly
occur inside the hive [8], making their systematic and
non-disruptive study challenging. In this section, we outline
the design, construction, and characterization of a robotic
device tailored to integrate into a honeybee colony and
interact with their collective thermoregulatory behaviors.
We elaborate on the system’s overall architecture, its
sensing and modulatory functionalities, and the mechanical

construction ensuring compatibility with both agricultural
and scientific hives. Finally, we describe the adopted
procedures to prepare the system for animal integration.
A. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
A device intended to form a mixed society with living animals
must, like most robots, possess sensing and actuating capa-
bilities complemented by some computational power [14],
[61]. Our system embodies these three elements, as illustrated
in Fig. 2a. At its core a 32-bit microcontroller unit (MCU,
STMicroelectronics STM32F405) orchestrates the system,
gathering data from sensors, managing thermal actuators, and
communicating with external controlling devices.
To sense its surrounding environment, the system is
equipped with an array of 64 temperature sensors distributed
across the surface accessible to bees, therefore enabling the
system to capture a detailed thermal snapshot in close prox-
imity to the animals. Auxiliary data regarding hive dynamics
and microclimate are obtained using a carbon dioxide sensor
and a humidity sensor (Sec. II-B). Additionally, a power
sensor measures the input voltage and current drawn by
the system, ensuring effective monitoring of the device’s
performance.
To allow interaction with the animals, the system employs
a set of 10 thermal actuators each capable of dissipating 15 W.
These actuators are controlled by dedicated digital control
loops and driving electronics (Sec. II-C). Additionally, the
system is equipped with data storage capabilities via an SD
card and supports various communication protocols including
USB, CAN, UART, and I2C. This multi-protocol support
ensures that the system can be interfaced with a range of
devices such as personal computers, single-board computers,
or other microcontrollers located external to the hives.
The USB peripheral serves as the primary method of
communication. Its utilization is straightforward, given that
the chosen MCU includes the necessary software stack
and the physical layer electronics required for establishing
communication with compatible devices. Moreover, the
robustness of USB is a significant advantage since it employs
differential transmission lines and shielded cables, which are
highly effective against electrical noise. Also, to guarantee the
integrity of the data during transmission, each set of sensory
data is accompanied by a checksum. This allows for detection
of any data corruption that might occur during transmission
events.
To enhance the chances of biocompatibility with bee
colonies and with existing hive configurations, the robotic
system was designed in the form of a beekeeping frame
(Sec. II-D). It consists of acrylic layers encasing a printed
circuit board, which serves as the base for the honeycomb
and houses all electronic components. Since bees are very
protective towards their nest [62], [63], bees and electronics
were separated by creating two segregated zones, the ‘‘bee
arena’’ where bees can reside and build their honeycombs,
and the ‘‘electronics bay’’ where electronic parts are housed
inside a protected zone, inaccessible to bees (Fig. 2b).
1) LOW-LEVEL SOFTWARE
The software embedded in the MCU serves as the linchpin
for every component of the robotic device. To effectively
manage the low-level software execution, we employed a
real-time operating system (RTOS, ChibiOS v19.1), chosen
for its deterministic behavior. The RTOS’s multithreaded
scheduler facilitated the compartmentalization of code into
three distinct threads: sensing, actuating, and a MicroPython
interpreter. Each thread was assured execution within a
precise and adjustable time frame. Our inclusion of an
VOLUME 12, 2024
50853
R. Barmak et al.: Biohybrid Superorganisms—On the Design of a Robotic System for Thermal Interactions
onboard MicroPython interpreter aimed to streamline system
parameter adjustments in real-time, eliminating the need to
shut down the system, compile, and upload new code after
every modification. Additionally, the adoption of a language
with simple syntax expanded the system’s usability, making
it approachable even for individuals without a background in
embedded software development.
To increase the reliability and stability of the system during
prolonged operation, we implemented the following features.
Firstly, we enabled the MCU watchdog timer (IWDG) to reset
the MCU upon overflow and prevent system lockups. Each
task within the firmware was required to report its execution
status. The system handler, upon confirming all executions,
would clear the watchdog timer to prevent the microcontroller
from resetting. The duration of the IWDG is dictated by the
time required to complete the sensing and actuating threads.
Secondly, using a combination of the Real-Time Clock (RTC)
and hardware registers, to record the reason for resets, allows
the system to log and report reset events to the user, further
increasing the system’s reliability (see also Sec. II-C7).
2) TIMEKEEPING
Accurately timestamping events is important in analyzing
bee behaviors over short and long timescales. Therefore,
we utilized the microcontroller’s Real-Time Clock (RTC) as
the reference time source for our system. To enhance time
accuracy, the RTC was driven by an external crystal oscillator
(ECS ECX-34RR) featuring a temporal drift of 20 ppm,
equivalent to ±1.73 s/day. In order to account for daily
time variations, the control device, typically a Raspberry
Pi single-board computer, continuously monitored the time
offset between the two devices. If this offset exceeded 1 s, the
control device issued a command to resynchronize the robotic
device’s clock.
B. SENSORS
For a robotic system to be able to observe and interact
with an animal colony, it must be able to accurately capture
the state of the colony. Therefore, a careful selection of
sensors must be made to successfully record the dynamics
of a colony. Transducers must be sensitive and accurate to
the signals of interest, but also small and robust to avoid
influencing the animals’ behaviors and withstand the harsh
conditions of a hive. Moreover, individual sensors may not
provide enough information to investigate and interact with
collective behaviors. Honeybee groups adapt their behavior
to local conditions. As a consequence, bees are rarely static.
Therefore, the number of sensors plays a vital role when
reconstructing the patterns produced by a group of animals.
Finally, sensors must sample the desired variable according
to the dynamics of the signals being observed. Here we
establish the technical specifications, the constraints arising
from the colony and behaviors of interest, and describe the
sensor subsystem design and its implementation to fulfill the
specifications.
1) TEMPERATURE SENSING
Temperature is a critical variable that demands continuous
monitoring within a honeybee colony. It serves as a direct
indicator of the overall health status of the colony and plays
a vital role in investigating essential social dynamics within
it [7], [40], [64], [65]. For example, with the increase in
temperature in late winter and during the foraging season,
the colony raises new bees (the brood) [54], keeping the
temperature of the broodnest tightly regulated between
33 – 36 °C [19], varying only a few degrees. Conversely,
in colder periods, the colony forms a compact cluster to
maintain safe temperature levels, known as the winter cluster.
Therefore, considering the significance of thermoregulatory
collective behaviors for the colony’s homeostasis [10], [18],
we investigated the thermal sensing requirements for a
robotic system to explore a ‘‘thermal pathway’’ for interacting
with honeybee colonies.
a: BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS
Honeybees have adapted to a wide variety of climates [51],
[66]. For colonies found in high-latitude or high-altitude
regions, regular winters reach freezing temperatures, while
in tropical and arid places, temperatures commonly surpass
+40 °C. In fact, bees have been observed living in tempera-
tures of −45 °C [66] and +48 °C [67]. Since colony activities
are directly influenced by the ambient temperature [4],
[18], a sensor must be able to measure this temperature
range.
Thermal dynamics are rather slow within a beehive. During
the foraging season, bees heat the broodnest at rates of
0.1 – 0.2 °C/min [56], [68], while in the winter, bees in the
cluster can adapt thermogenesis to rates up to 1.1 °C/min
[69]. Therefore, to record the temperature changes of the
relevant thermogenic behaviors sensors need a sampling
rate of only a few samples per minute. Additionally, the
contents of the cells significantly influence the rate at
which temperature changes are detected by the sensors.
Employing a straightforward model (refer to Supplementary
Material, Text S1), we estimate that the time taken by a
bee to elevate a cell’s temperature by 1 °C ranges from
approximately 13 seconds (for empty cells) to 50 seconds (for
cells containing pupae).
Furthermore, the atmosphere within a beehive can reach
high humidity levels [70], imposing treatments to both
sensors and electronic components to ensure their safe
and reliable operation in such conditions. Finally, we are
interested in interacting with groups of animals engaged in
collective behaviors that present some level of motility (e.g.,
[40], [71]), requiring the system to be equipped with an array
of spatially distributed sensors to continuously monitor the
signals of interest [72].
b: SENSOR SELECTION
We investigated for sensing solutions that would fulfill the
above requirements by having (i) a resolution better than
50854
VOLUME 12, 2024
R. Barmak et al.: Biohybrid Superorganisms—On the Design of a Robotic System for Thermal Interactions
0.01 °C, (ii) low operating current and consequently low
self-heating, and (iii) a small footprint, to comfortably fit
inside honeycomb cells. In order to minimize part count and
consequently the space occupied by the circuit, we focused
our survey on silicon-based temperature sensors with on-chip
ADC (analog-to-digital converter), which usually also brings
the added advantage of reduced noise when compared to
analog sensors placed a certain distance from the ADC. After
surveying 12 different integrated devices that could meet
these specifications (see Table S1 for the list of candidates),
we selected the Texas Instruments’ TMP117 [73] as the
temperature sensor for the robotic frame. This sensor was
chosen for its notably small physical dimensions, superior
accuracy, and minimal operating current compared to other
candidates. Additionally, it was readily available in large
quantities from major electronics suppliers.
The TMP117 characteristics (see Table 1) can rival
Class AA resistance temperature detectors (RTDs) with a
temperature accuracy of ±0.1 °C over the range −20 °C to
50 °C, and with repeatability of ±1 LSB (least significant
bit). Temperature values are digitized with a 16-bit ADC
resulting in a resolution of 0.0078 °C (= 1 LSB). In 8-sample
averaging mode, the conversion time is 125 ms, equivalent to
a maximum sampling frequency of fs = 8 Hz . Moreover, the
device has a maximum current demand of 220 µA when in
averaging mode, and 3.1 µA when in standby mode (average
energy E = V ·Iavg ·t = 3.3 V · 30.2 µA · 125 ms = 12.5 µJ).
The sensor’s packaging size of 2 mm × 2 mm × 0.8 mm can
comfortably sit inside the honeycomb cells (Fig. 3a,d).
A positive consequence of the low power required by the
sensor is the small self-heating effect that could bias temper-
ature recordings and impact bees. A simplified assessment
of the effect of the sensor’s dissipated power on temperature
readings can be made using the thermal metrics of the
sensor packaging and its operating conditions. The package
temperature increase can be estimated as 1T = R2JT · PD,
where R2JT is the junction-to-ambient thermal resistance
of the component (R2JT = 70.7 °C/W) [73], and PD is the
dissipated power (= Vs · Iavg = 3.3 V · 30.2 µA = 99.7 µW).
For the TMP117 packaging, we estimated a negligible rise of
1T ∼0.007 °C. In this estimation, important effects of the
PCB structure and environmental factors are not considered
but tend to reduce the rise of temperature.
c: SENSOR DENSITY
Some useful information can be extracted from a hive
monitored by a small number of sensors [74], [75], [76].
Nonetheless, the dynamic nature of complex collective
behaviors typically demands a more extensive sensor array
to accurately capture the change of patterns of bees in
motion [72]. An insufficient number of sensors could restrict
an artificial agent’s ability to construct an accurate model
of its surroundings, consequently hindering its capability
to emit pertinent stimuli for effective interaction with the
animals.
TABLE 1. Summary of TMP117 specifications and array configuration.
One of the first systems to use an array of temperature
sensors (192 thermocouples)1 for long-duration monitoring
of overwintering colonies was the work developed by
C. Owens, in 1971 [71]. It wasn’t until the 2000s, almost
30 years past this landmark work, that highly integrated
semiconductor devices became easily accessible, allowing a
new surge of research using multiple sensors inside hives
(e.g., [79], [80], [81], [82], [83]).
In
our
system,
we
distributed
a
regular
array
of
5 × 11 sensors across the bee-occupied portion of the frame
(the ‘‘bee arena’’), with horizontal and vertical spacing of
36.8 mm and 36.4 mm respectively (Fig. 3a). This design was
informed by several key considerations. We aimed to obtain
a high spatial resolution of thermal sensing while also being
sensitive to cost, and design feasibility such as routing density
and device address space. Since 4 × 8 TMP117 sensors can
be addressed with 8-channel multiplexers, we considered
multiples of 32 devices (i.e., up to 32, 64, 96, etc.).
Geometric constraints came from the frame’s specific aspect
ratio and our aim of aligning the sensor placement within
honeycomb cells. To avoid disproportionate spacing along
the horizontal or vertical axes, we refrained from row/column
configurations with a large imbalance. Thus, we opted for
an array of 5 × 11 sensors. Since the address space could
accommodate 64 sensors, we also added a high density
patch (HDP) of nine sensors, positioned in the central part
of the frame, to allow future investigations of high spatial
resolution phenomena. In total, the system is comprised of
64 temperature sensors (plus two extra sensors from the
CO2 and humidity sensors located in the electronics bay).
To manage the communication with such a large number of
sensors, we employed two 8-channel I2C multiplexers (Texas
Instruments TCA9548A) enabling the MCU to continuously
scan groups of four TMP117s. After the sensors store
the sampled temperature in their internal memory, reading
1Precursory works using electronic temperature sensors, albeit applied for
short periods of time, were performed by Milner & Demuth, in 1921 [77],
and P. Lavie, in 1954 [78], with systems comprised of 14 and 6 thermistors
respectively.

all 64 sensors takes approximately 1.5 ms. Example data
Example data captured by the sensor array from a colony
during winter are visualized to show temporal (Fig. 3b)
and spatial (Fig. 3c) patterns. The spatial reconstruction is
detailed in Sec. V-C.
d: SENSOR PREPARATION
The temperature sensors are the only electronic components
within direct reach of the animals. Therefore, they required
safeguarding and adaptation to both minimize interference
with the animals and endure the hive’s microclimate and any
defensive behaviors exhibited by the animals. The following
procedures were implemented and validated across 10 robotic
units from 2020 to 2023 (see Fig. 3d):
1) Each sensor and its metal pads were coated with an
acrylic conformal coating (MG Chemicals 419D) to a
thickness of 50 µm to 75 µm for moisture protection.
2) To constrain access to the sensor pins, and also to
induce the construction of wax combs, a hexagonal
mesh was fixed to the PCB covering entirely the ‘‘bee
arena’’ (see Sec. II-D).
3) To assist in the construction of combs, and add an extra
protection layer during the process of colonization of
the robotic frames, a thin layer of melted beeswax was
applied over the ‘‘bee arena’’.
4) At this stage, we introduced the robotic frames into
a full-colony box hive, housing up to 40 000 bees,
as opposed to the smaller population in an observation
hive. This larger number of bees facilitated the comb-
building process, as the larger number of individuals
meant more resources were available for wax cell
construction. Typically, we replaced either one or two
of the ten regular frames.
5) The duration of comb building varied, typically lasting
2 to 3 weeks, although this period was subject to
seasonal variation. Honeybees exhibit different rates
of comb construction depending on the time of year,
with accelerated activity observed earlier in the season.
Once the combs were completed, the robotic frames
were transferred to the experimental hives [84].
It is important to note that in preliminary trials, we omitted
the use of the hexagonal mesh (i.e., skipped step #2), and
covered the robotic device PCBs directly with beeswax.
We observed that without the mesh, comb construction was
less uniform, had poorer coverage of the device surface
or even avoided constructing comb on the PCB surface,
and exhibited inferior geometry (e.g., loss of symmetry)
compared to frames equipped with the mesh.
e: SENSOR EVALUATION
To test the performance of the TMP117 sensor, we analyzed
the data generated by three sensors mounted on a small PCB.
We carried out two tests. The first compared the temperature
readings from each sensor against each other (Fig. 3e), and
the second involved comparing these readings against those
from a calibrated reference thermometer (Fig. 3f,g). For both
tests, the PCB, which was covered in a thin polyethylene
film, and the reference thermometer were placed in a thermal
bath. The bath water was initially cooled to 6 °C with ice,
then warmed for 70 min until reaching approximately 60 °C.
To ensure a uniform water temperature, a motorized propeller
continuously stirred the water. Data samples were gathered
every half-second (nsamples = 8363).
The first test was designed to measure consistency among
the three TMP117 sensors. We compared the temperature
data recorded by each sensor against each other. By calcu-
lating the absolute temperature differences between pairs of
sensors, we were able to visually represent value dispersion
and estimate any potential bias when all sensors were exposed
to the same temperature. Notably, the most significant
difference was between sensors 1 and 3, with a deviation
of (0.039 ± 0.012) °C, and a maximum deviation of 0.062 °C
(Fig. 3e).
The second test was performed to compare the TMP117
sensor values against a high-accuracy temperature probe.
For the reference thermometer, we used a calibrated Class
1/10 DIN RTD probe (Process Parameters PPL1-P) connected
to an ohmmeter in a 4-wire configuration (HP 34401A)
to measure the water temperature. Throughout the exper-
iment, sensor 3 presented the highest maximum offset of
0.14 °C (Fig. 3f), and the median difference between the
three TMP117 sensors and the reference thermometer was
(0.083 ± 0.014) °C (Fig. 3g).
2) CARBON DIOXIDE AND HUMIDITY SENSING
Humidity and carbon dioxide (CO2) are critical biophysical
parameters in the microclimate inside a beehive [85]. CO2,
a byproduct of bee respiration, serves as an indirect indicator
of metabolic activity [86], [87]. High CO2 concentrations,
however, can be toxic to bees, potentially triggering a group
ventilation effort known as fanning [57], [85]. Appropriate
humidity levels are necessary for healthy brood development,
the ripening of nectar into honey, and prevention of water
condensation in colder temperatures [66], [70], [88], [89].
Consequently, incorporating sensors for these parameters into
the robotic frame could offer valuable data for studying social
dynamics.
Considering the constraints of size and the ability to
measure high CO2 concentrations found in bee colonies,
not many sensors on the market were suitable. We opted
for the Sensirion SCD-30 sensor due to its capability
to measure concentrations ranging from 0 to 10 000 ppm,
with an accuracy of ±(30 ppm + 3%) and repeatability of
±10 ppm [90].
For the humidity sensor, we evaluated a range of commer-
cially available options (Table S2). Two devices emerged as
the top contenders, the Texas Instruments HDC2010 and the
Sensirion SHT35. While the SHT35 offered slightly better
performance with a typical accuracy of 1.5%, compared to
2% of the HDC2010, the latter was more cost-effective and
consumed less power, albeit with the slight compromise on
VOLUME 12, 2024

accuracy [91]. Despite these advantages, supply chain disrup-
tions during the COVID-19 outbreak significantly hindered
the availability of HDC2010. Consequently, we employed the
SHT35 sensor in the device.
C. THERMAL ACTUATORS FOR HONEYBEE INTERACTIONS
In order to interact with animals, a robotic system must
be able not only to sense the animal’s behavior but also
be able to send relevant cues [14]. In a system aimed at
studying thermoregulatory behaviors, one way to achieve
such interactions is through the use of thermal actuators
(TAs) capable of producing cues similar to those naturally
experienced by bees. In this section, we describe the design
and implementation of such actuators.
1) BIOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS
The metabolic heat production of honeybees is subject
to significant variation, influenced primarily by ambient
temperature and the number of bees engaged in thermogenic
activity [18], [87]. Bees generate heat by shivering their
wing thoracic muscles, a process that produces heat as a
metabolic byproduct [92]. Although an individual bee is
capable of generating up to 230 W/kg of heat [18], the
thermoregulatory process within a hive is a shared effort.
Consequently, each bee’s heating contribution is typically
less than its maximum capacity. This is particularly evident
during winter when the colony collectively regulates the
nest’s temperature, by transforming the stored honey into
heat (chemical energy →thermal energy) and modulating
the thermal conductivity of the bee cluster by adjusting
inter-bee spacing. Previous research has shown that the
collective metabolic rate decreases as the number of bees
increases [92], with the colony’s peak metabolic rates
recorded at 150 W/kg and more commonly around 33.5 W/kg
[87]. These values were used to steer the design of the thermal
actuators.
To increase the likelihood of bees recognizing the thermal
cues emitted by the thermal actuators as originating from
their conspecifics (i.e., other honeybees), we strategically
integrated these actuators into the comb foundation. Placing
actuators within the space that divides the two sides of
the robotic device (see Fig. 6a), mirroring the design of
beekeeping frames, capitalizes on bees’ natural inclination to
seek warmth generated by their fellow bees on the reverse side
of the frame. Moreover, using an array of multiple actuators
within each frame enables localized heat generation in a
region where the only natural heat source would be other
bees.
2) THERMAL ACTUATORS FROM LONG MEANDERED
PLANAR TRACES
The robotic system’s actuators were devised to be able to
dissipate a combined power of 150 W, similar to the peak
metabolic activity of a 1-kg colony in winter [87] (this
mass equates to ∼7700 bees [93]). In order to allow the
TABLE 2. Summary of thermal actuator characteristics.
production of thermal cues with distinct spatial patterns,
we distributed ten actuators into a 5 × 2 array (Fig. 4a-c).
Current flowing through a resistor will dissipate some energy
in the form of heat - Joule heating (electrical energy →
thermal energy). Following this principle, for each thermal
actuator, we designed a conductor with a specific value of
resistance able to dissipate a maximum of Pact = 15 W. For
a system powered by a 12 V supply, each thermal actuator
must have a maximum resistance of Ract
= V 2
act/PD =
9.6 Ω. We opted to use a Ract = 9.1 Ωto allow an extra
power dissipation margin (PD = 15.8 W) and the availability
of commercial resistors with this nominal value, in the E24
series, simplifying the evaluation and testing of the driving
circuit.
With a printed circuit board (PCB) used as the central
foundation of the system (Sec. II-D), we utilized one of the
outermost copper layers to design the planar actuators. The
necessary trace length to achieve the required resistance was
found via ℓt = (Ract · wt · ht)/(ρcu · [1 + αcu(T −T0)]),
where wt and ht are the width and height of the trace, ρcu
is the copper resistivity, and αcu is the copper resistivity
thermal coefficient. For a trace width of wt = 0.267 mm and
height ht = 35 µm (copper weight of 1-oz.) we calculated
a trace length of ℓt
= 4852 mm. With the objective of
achieving a higher temperature homogeneity, we chose to
design the heater pattern based on a Hilbert space-filling
curve [94]. A Hilbert fractal can be created by the iteration
of replicas of a rotatable seed geometry. This process is
illustrated in Fig. 4d, showing the initial iterations, n = 1
to 3, and the final heater pattern generated by a 6th order
Hilbert curve. To create a space-filling curve with the required
length (ℓt = 4852 mm), each segment of the curve should be
ℓt/(4order −1) = 1.185 mm long, resulting in a final actuator
with a square geometry having 74.7 mm sides. These These
specifications and results are summarized in Table 2.
3) DRIVING CIRCUIT
To regulate the power delivered to each thermal actuator, each
of the ten drivers is controlled by a pulse-width modulated
(PWM) signal originating at the MCU (Fig. 2a). The activa-
tion duration (i.e., period when current is flowing through

the TA) is adjusted by each of the numerical controllers
running in the MCU and reflected in the changes to the
duty cycle of the control signal. This PWM signal is injected
into a gate driver chip (Texas Instruments UCC27517A) that
can rapidly turn on or off an N-channel power MOSFET
transistor (Vishay SiSS12DN). To minimize heat dissipation
by the transistor, the selected part has a low ‘‘on’’ resistance,
typically lower than Ron ≤3 mΩ. We also added flywheel
diodes to protect the actuators’ driving circuits from voltage
spikes produced by stray inductance when the TAs are turned
off.
4) THERMAL PROFILE OF TAS
To establish the temperature profile of the thermal actuators,
we applied a constant voltage for a period of 10 minutes
when measuring the temperature at the center of the actuator.
We used an RTD rated 100 Ωat 0 °C (Thorlabs TH100PT,
upt100 ± 0.3 + 0.005·|T|°C, where T
is temperature)
connected to a digital multimeter in a Kelvin (four-wire)
configuration (HP34401A, ures ± 51 mΩ). The electrical
current flowing through the actuator was also recorded
using the power supply data interface (Rigol DP832A,
voltage and current uncertainties of 0.05% + 10 mV and

actuators and bees are distinguishable. After approximately 12 h the fields merged. The thicker black line represents the 22 °C isotherm. (c) Since
we adopted an animal-in-the-loop strategy, at moments bees ‘‘allowed’’ the robotic system to engage more (for example at t = 0.5 days) or less
(t = 2.25 days). The dissipated power by the two active actuators is depicted by the purple lines, and the maximum temperature on the frame
surface Tmax by the yellow curve. Data smoothed via a median filter with a 2-h kernel.
0.15% + 5 mA). To establish the temperature variation
for a specific supplied voltage, we calculated the median
temperature of the last 10 seconds (nsamples = 10) when the
temperature had stabilized (not changing more than 0.4 °C
in the last minute), and subtracted from it the ambient
temperature value (1T = Tactuator −Tamb). The ambient
temperature in the lab, Tamb, was recorded as the median
value of 64 temperature sensors from an additional robotic
system installed adjacent to the experiment (d
∼1 m).
This procedure was performed for voltage steps of 0.25 V
between 0 V to 12 V, and repeated on five thermal actuators.
Increasing the applied voltage, and therefore the supplied
current (I = V/R), we observed similar behavior in all tested
actuators, displaying an exponential temperature increase
(Fig. 4e).
5) ELECTRICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF TAS
In order to quantify the deviation of the manufactured
actuators’ resistance RTA from the nominal (designed) value
of Ract = 9.1 Ω, we measured the resistance of 110 thermal
actuators, from 11 PCBs, using the same 4-wire configuration
described above. The measured resistance of the TAs was
RTA = (7.85 ± 0.63) Ω(nTA = 110, T amb
∼
23 °C),
a difference of −1.25 Ωto the target value. It is important to
note the inevitable resistance drift due to the non-negligible
copper resistivity thermal coefficient, which precludes the
possibility of precisely defining the resistance value for the
thermal actuators (Fig. 4f).
Despite the difficulty in fixating thermal actuators’ resis-
tance, the closed-loop controller automatically compensates
for these resistance fluctuations by adjusting the flow of
current (and therefore the dissipated power), thereby ensuring
that the target temperatures are consistently maintained.
6) CONTROLLERS
We devised two methods to control the power delivered
to thermal actuators. The first method, a simple constant
power controller, allows users and programs to directly adjust
the duty cycle of the PWM pulse that rapidly activates
and deactivates the actuators. The second method uses a
numerically implemented PID control loop to adjust the actu-
ator temperature, with feedback from the temperature sensor
array. Although variability in resistance due to manufacturing
(Sec. II-C5) or due to variations from temperature (Fig. 4f)
would influence the power dissipated by the direct PWM
adjustment method, the PID control loop that adjusts the
duty cycle according to temperature feedback is not sensitive
to such variability. Each thermal actuator has a controller
that is influenced only by the sensors mounted directly on
top of the actuator. The ten control loops are executed in
a dedicated thread of the RTOS (Sec. II-A), immediately
after the execution of the sensor thread, and updated at
intervals of 10 s. We performed an experiment to quantify
the thermal regulation capabilities of controllers and thermal
actuators together. Using an empty robotic frame installed
vertically in an observation hive, we activated each of the
50860
VOLUME 12, 2024
R. Barmak et al.: Biohybrid Superorganisms—On the Design of a Robotic System for Thermal Interactions
ten actuators for a duration of 10 min with six different
objective objective temperatures Tobj, from 25 °C to 35 °C
(Fig. 4g). In the experiment, it took a bit less than 4 min for
temperatures to stabilize. The highest overshoot occurred at
a target temperature of 29 °C, reaching a median overshoot
of 3.5 °C (n = 10). Once the controller reached a steady
state, the highest offset between setpoints and the median
temperature of the last 5 min was −0.29 °C, at Tobj = 35 °C.
The maximum deviation between two sensors across the
actuator surface (i.e., thermal inhomogeneity) had a median
value of (2.66 ± 1.89) °C. During the experiment, the lab
temperature was T amb = (21.5 ± 0.4) °C.
To improve the bio-integration of the system and increase
the odds of acceptance by the colony, we fixed the frequency
of the ten PWM channels to 5 kHz. This value is above the
bee’s spectral response to sound and vibration [95], therefore
minimizing the chances of spurious vibrations that can
disturb honeybee behaviors such as the waggle dance [96].
Furthermore, the default limit to the rate of temperature
change is adjusted to 2 °C over 10 min, a value observed in
larval cells [56].
In our final effort to enhance the bio-acceptance of the
thermal actuators, we implemented an ‘‘animal-in-the-loop’’
configuration [60], wherein the same sensors measuring
thermal behavior also provide temperature feedback to the
controllers. To assess the actuators’ influence on honeybees,
we activated the two leftmost actuators at time t
= 0,
setting them to a target temperature Tobj
= 25 °C. This
was done when a winter cluster was positioned near the
center of the robotic frame (refer to Fig. 5a,b, illustrating
the thermal patterns from both actuators and bees). The
actuators’ maximum combined power was limited to 3 W.
However, during the three-day experiment, they operated at
less than half their maximum capacity, averaging 44% =
(1.32 ± 0.44) W (median ± MAD). For the initial 1.75 days,
we observed a combined heating effort from both the bees and
the robotic device, indicated by Tmax consistently nearing the
set target (Tobj = 25 °C, as seen in Fig. 5c). Around day 1.75,
despite no significant change in the ambient temperature
[Tamb(1.75)
= 10.9 °C], the bees began to increase the
cluster temperature, reaching a peak at Tmax
= 36.0 °C,
(Tamb = 13.3 °C). This caused the actuators to disengage.
After a period of reduced activity, the actuators re-engaged,
as indicated by the rise in dissipated power (purple curves
at t = 2 days in Fig. 5c). Due to the short duration of this
experiment, it was not possible to conclude whether there was
a time dependency on the animals’ response, like habituation
(see Sec. III-B for a longer-term experiment). This brief
experiment confirmed the actuators’ operational efficacy in
the presence of animals.
7) SAFETY MECHANISMS
Our previous measurements present evidence that the thermal
actuators are capable of reaching dangerous temperatures,
enough to melt wax and harm animals (Fig. 4f). For
this reason, many safety mechanisms were implemented in
the hardware and at the low-level firmware. During the
validation phase of the system, a 3A resettable fuse was
installed upstream of the actuators’ power supply, limiting
the maximum power dissipation to 36 W. Another protection
feature was implemented in the PID controllers, where the
total current drain is limited, by default, to 1 A. Furthermore,
the controllers were programmed to disable the actuators
if sensors stop responding or if the controllers do not
respond for more than two minutes. Finally, two temperature
thresholds are in place. A soft and adjustable limit is initially
configured to 35 °C, and a hard-coded limit is at 47 °C.
D. MECHANICAL CONSTRUCTION AND FORMING A
BIOHYBRID SOCIETY
The mechanical design of the robotic beekeeping frame
revolves around its acceptance within a bee colony, not
by mimicking bees’ appearance but through the integration
of shapes and materials already successful in agricul-
tural beekeeping. The robotic frame takes on the dimen-
sions of a standard Zander beekeeping frame, measuring
420 mm × 220 mm, ensuring compatibility with widely used
agricultural and observation hives. The frame structure was
constructed from six laser-cut layers of acrylic with the
PCB in the center serving as a foundation for the combs
(Fig. 6a). Modern materials like plastics have long been
incorporated into honeybee colonies [97]. We opted to use
PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate), also known as acrylic or
plexiglass, a thermoplastic frequently employed in various
engineering applications due to its mechanical properties,
such as ease of machining. The decision to use it as the
material for the frame structure was also influenced by
its biocompatibility. Acrylic has been used extensively in
beehive construction and bee-related research for several
decades (e.g., [98], [99], [100]). Adjoining the PCB are layers
of 1-mm thick wood (or optionally acrylic), which are cut
into a hexagonal pattern to guide bees in their honeycomb
construction activities [101] (see Fig. 3d). The hexagonal
cells were designed to have inner minor and major axes
of 4.55 mm and 5.25 mm, and wall thickness of 0.7 mm.
To bolster structural rigidity and to demarcate an electronics
bay isolated from the bees, two additional acrylic layers
were integrated into the design (Fig. 6a, blue and green
structures). All cut parts were rinsed with isopropyl alcohol
to remove small debris and eliminate any residual odors
from the laser-cutting process. Once assembled, the region
occupied by bees, the ‘‘bee arena’’, has a surface area of
410 mm × 180 mm per side (Fig. 2b). The entire assembly is
held securely using 2-mm nylon screws.
Having the PCB as the foundation for the honeycombs
was important since its epoxy-fiberglass substrate has a
thermal conductivity similar to beeswax, at approximately
κ ∼0.3 W/m°C [102], [103].
To protect the electronics from the high-humidity atmo-
sphere of a hive [70], all electronic components received a

layer of the same protective resin used in the temperature
sensors (see Sec. II-B1, Sensor preparation). Prior to the
frame’s introduction into a hive cables for cables for power
and data were affixed securely to the frame structure.
Before initiating experiments, frames were ‘‘incubated’’
in a large foster colony within box hives to accelerate the
comb construction (Fig. 6c). Typically, bees took two to three
weeks to build over the hexagonal mesh on both sides of the
device. Once the frames were sufficiently constructed, they
were moved to the experimental hives and populated with a
suitably sized colony. Often, we utilized part of the foster
colony to populate these experimental hives and introduced
a new queen.
III. A BIOHYBRID SOCIETY TO STUDY HONEYBEES
The successful establishment of a biohybrid society hinges
on the effective observation and modulation capabilities of
the robotic elements. One of the robotic system’s primary
objectives is to facilitate the comprehensive observation
of group dynamics (i.e., ‘‘reality mining’’ [15]), enabling
in-depth examination of significant portions of the colony
at a high sampling rate. Furthermore, a pivotal facet of
designing such a mixed society lies in establishing an
efficient communication channel between artificial and
living agents [14] allowing the interaction between the
two. To evaluate the system for these crucial capacities,
we performed two experiments: a long-term observation of
a colony and a perturbation experiment aimed at modulating
the collective position of a winter cluster, an aggregation
behavior initiated when temperatures are low.
A. OBSERVING COLONY LEVEL DYNAMICS
To assess the performance of our system in observing
colony-level thermoregulatory behaviors (Sec. II-B), we

foraging season, showing nursing bees around capped cells, indicating brood presence. (b) Photograph and thermal image in colder conditions (ambient
temperatures around Tamb = 10 °C), with isotherms outlining the cluster’s core (Tcore = 21.5 °C) and mantle (Tmantle = 15.1 °C) [40]. (c) Time series of
temperatures from two sensors: one centrally located in the ‘bee arena’ (orange), and the other at the frame’s periphery (blue), alongside with Tamb.
introduced a robotic frame into an observation hive housing
a colony of approximately 4000 bees (see Sec. V-A). We
present data spanning 121 days, which encompassed two
critical periods within a honeybee colony’s life cycle: the
foraging season and the cold season.
During the warmer months, foraging bees venture out of
the hive to gather essential supplies such as nectar, pollen,
and water. Inside the hive, groups of young worker bees
perform a decentralized collective thermoregulation of the
broodnest. As discussed earlier (see Sec. I-C), nursing bees
regulate the incubation temperature within a thermal range
for healthy brood development, from 33 °C to 36 °C [4].
These temperature values are maintained throughout at least
one brood cycle, spanning from the queen laying the egg
until the emergence of an adult bee, which typically lasts
around 21 days for worker bees. In Figure 7, we show
that the distinguishing spatial and temporal characteristics
of the broodnest [79] could be observed by the robotic
frame. For example, on day 46 of the experiment, the
measured thermal field displayed a well-defined heated area
(Fig. 7a) kept within the temperature range of 33 °C to
36 °C (gray horizontal band in Fig. 7c), characteristic of the
broodnest [104], and covering approximately A33oC = 31%
of the ‘‘bee arena’’ (Fig. 7a). Inspecting the data produced
by one sensor located inside the broodnest region (data →
orange curve, and sensor →orange circle), we observe that
the temperature regulation persisted for a duration of 23 days,
which encompasses a brood cycle. Furthermore, the presence
of brood cells could be verified by inspection of the hive and
via photographic evidence.
Around day 100 of the experiment, when the ambient
temperature dropped below 15 °C, we observed the colony
clustering and forming the characteristic ellipsoidal shape of
a winter cluster [71]. An example of this collective effort to
maintain safe temperatures is shown in the thermal field from
day 117 (Fig. 7b), with the highest temperature at the center
of the cluster at 25.7 °C (Fig. 7b,c •), a difference of +15.6 °C
in relation to the surrounding temperatures, Tamb.
B. MODULATING COLLECTIVE BEHAVIORS
In a second experiment, we investigated whether the artificial
cues generated by groups of thermal actuators (Sec. II-C)
could influence the position of a winter cluster comprised of
1200 bees (Sec. V-A). In an observation hive with two robotic

frames, with a total surface of 2952 cm2 (= 2 frames ×
2 sides × 410 mm × 180 mm), we sequentially engaged
one set of actuators to try to attract bees to one of the
four predefined zones, as illustrated in Figure 8a. Once the
majority of the cluster had congregated in the designated area,
we manually triggered the next zone. The activation sequence
was intentionally defined to form an unusual ▷◁-shaped
pattern and included the activation of ‘‘distant’’ actuators,
thus producing non-contiguous heated zones that required the
bees to traverse unheated spaces.
The ▷◁-loop trajectory was performed twice. In the first
loop, the four thermal actuators of each target zone were
activated to 30 °C (Fig. S1), and in the second loop TAs were
activated to 25 °C (Fig. 8). In both cases, the bees followed
the unnatural trajectory that the robotic system presented,
taking approximately 35 days for the two trajectories. During
the experiment, the ambient temperature remained between
3.8 °C to 15.5 °C.
The bees consistently maintained the cluster’s core temper-
ature slightly above that of the actuated zone, as illustrated
in Fig. 8c. During the initial 17 days of the ▷◁-circuit,
the cluster exhibited an average maximum temperature of
T max = (35.0 ± 1.1) °C. Conversely, in the second circuit
with the actuators set to 25 °C, the average maximum

temperature reduced to T max
= (30.9 ± 1.7) °C. Notably,
in both instances, the maximum temperature was consistently
around 5 °C higher than the targets set for the actuators
(Tmax ∼Tobj + 5 °C).
During the eight transitions necessary to complete the
▷◁-trajectory twice, the cluster took on average 4.1 times
longer to perform a diagonal ‘‘jump’’ compared to vertical
movements (as summarized in Table 3). This difference is
likely due to the longer distances covered by the diagonal
path and the presence of a colder region between the cluster
and the newly activated region. Furthermore, when analyzing
the cluster’s response times to similar movement types (only
vertical or diagonal subsets), we found no notable variations
in response.

Interestingly, during the modulation experiment, the bees
consistently maintained the hive’s maximum temperature
Tmax at approximately 5 °C above the actuator’s target
temperature, Tobj. The reasons for this offset warrant
further investigation. Carbon dioxide measurements from
both frames revealed similar concentration levels (Fig. 8d),
suggesting that a single CO2 sensor might suffice for studying
hives of comparable sizes.
Together, these findings demonstrate the capacity of
robotic systems to actively shape and direct collective
behaviors within a honeybee winter cluster using thermal
cues. This highlights the effectiveness of the thermal pathway
as a means for fostering interactions between machines and
complete honeybee colonies.
IV. DISCUSSION
In this work, we detailed a robotic platform with results
evidencing the formation of a biohybrid society comprising
a honeybee colony and an autonomous robotic honeycomb.
This is a noteworthy advance, addressing challenges in
studying the collective behaviors of groups of thousands
of individuals sensitive to their social and physical envi-
ronments [13], [15], [105]. We provided technical details
about the robotic device design, considering biological
and scientific requirements (Sec. II). We characterized the
sensing and actuation capabilities of the device in the
lab. The performance evaluation of the robotic system
with honeybees involved two separate colonies. In one
experiment, a robotic device monitored collective thermoreg-
ulatory behaviors for 4 months and was able to observe
vital group dynamics during both warm and cold seasons
(Sec. III-A). In a second experiment, the collaboration
between two robotic devices influenced the movement of a
large number of bees along a ▷◁-trajectory, displaying the
devices’ ability to modulate colony-level collective dynamics
(Sec. III-B).
The thermal dynamics of the honeybee hive are one
of the most informative quantities about the colony [18].
Some foundational works investigated the spatiotemporal
distribution of thermal fields of winter clusters [71] and
broodnests [79]. This topic remains relevant and continues
to attract new research and the development of instru-
ments to observe the spatial distribution of in-hive thermal
fields (e.g., [81], [82]). During the observation experiment,
which spanned 121 days, the robotic device provided a
continuous view of the hive’s thermoregulatory behaviors
across different seasons with high spatiotemporal resolution.
This long-term observation allowed us to identify critical
group dynamics that are evident during the brood-rearing
period and in winter when the bees form a winter cluster
(Sec. III-A).
In the collective modulation experiment, the system
adeptly guided the winter cluster’s movement along an
unconventional trajectory between two robotic frames
(Sec. III-B). Over 35 days, the two devices influenced
the displacement of the winter cluster, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the actuator across different target tempera-
tures (Tobj). Inspecting the transition times to newly activated
regions (see Table 3), we infer that this specific colony did
not habituate to the thermal cues during the 35-day period.
This finding is consistent with results reported in [40], where
another colony exhibited a sustained response to repeated
thermal cues from a single robotic frame presented over
51 days. Here we extended the evidence that bee clusters
can traverse colder regions to access distant warm spots,
challenging existing theoretical models of cluster formation
and self-organization as discussed in [40].
Despite the growing interest in using robotics to investigate
biological systems, only a few studies have successfully
integrated robotic devices into honeybee groups (e.g., [22],
[38], [41], [42], [106]). The robotic device in the present
paper offers two relevant advances. Firstly, it tightly inte-
grates the ‘‘scientific instrument’’ into the research subject,
enabling scientists to monitor the colony from within (Fig. 1,
Fig. 3d, Fig. 6c). Secondly, it showcases the ability to
interact with entire honeybee colonies as they forage in
their natural environment. These two advances are significant
because they simultaneously enable (a) detailed investigation
into honeybee thermal dynamics (b) within a complete
social and environmental context. Specifically, the ability
to automate the generation of arbitrary thermal stimuli at
different locations within the colony facilitates experiments
to investigate, for example, thermal preferenda [107], the
effect of heating throughout winter on colony state [71],
[108], or responses to localized thermal stress [104], as well
as the injection of thermal stimuli that adapt to the animal
behaviors. Moreover, works investigating hive temperatures
have depicted recordings over long periods but with small
sensor count [72] or detailed spatial recordings but for short
periods [64], [79]. In contrast, the results above illustrate
temperature recordings with high resolution in spatial and
temporal dimensions that enable the tracking of collective
thermal behaviors.
Although the robotic system showcased promising results,
certain limitations were observed. For instance, although
the steady-state average temperature of the actuators was
precisely regulated (Fig.4g), there were observed differences
of up to 2.7 °C in the uniformity of the thermal field across
the actuator surface, as discussed in Sec. II-C. Such variations
are particularly critical in studies that require precise thermal
uniformity, highlighting an area in need of improvement.
To address this, future modifications could include reducing
the size of the actuators, altering the PCB design and its
layer stack-up to minimize the number and size of copper
structures (such as traces and planes) beneath each actuator,
and introducing horizontal slots between the rows of top and
bottom actuators to enhance thermal isolation.
Furthermore, with the promising results of the robotic
device thus far, we can envision integrating additional sensor
modalities to broaden the system’s observation capabilities.
For instance, sound sensors have been effectively used to
identify the presence of the queen [109] and to detect
VOLUME 12, 2024

swarming behaviors in the colony [110]. Another intriguing
further development could involve employing specialized
gas sensors, which may facilitate the detection of Varroa
destructor mite infestations within colonies [111]. Also,
expanding the number of thermal actuators by reducing their
size would enhance the device’s stimulation capacity and
directly improve its interaction abilities. Finally, expanding
the current hardware capabilities to enable wireless data
transfer would eliminate the need for one cable and enhance
the system’s overall robustness.
As we intensify the use of the robotic platform and start
delving deeper into studying bee colonies, some intriguing
questions arise. For example, to what extent do the bees
interpret the signals from the thermal actuators as social
cues as if from their peers (see [12]), as opposed to merely
environmental changes within the nest? When actuators
replay temperature time series recorded from winter clusters,
are they more attractive to the bees in comparison to fixed
setpoints (see [29])? Here, it is worth noting that besides
synthetic thermal patterns and replaying natural trajectories,
our system could also over-express stimulus trajectories
– akin to robotic models over-expressing morphological
features [46] or behavioral ones [112]. Experiments aiming
to identify robot-mediated thermal profiles that stimulate a
small colony to behave similarly to a larger non-stimulated
colony may provide insights into these questions of ‘social
integration’ of the robots [12].
How do varying internal
and external environmental conditions impact the capacity
of these thermal actuators to influence behaviors?
Using
our robotic systems to modify hive-internal conditions,
in conjunction with a thermally controlled chamber to
stabilize [87] or modify [113] the ambient experienced
by a colony would allow such investigation.
Looking
ahead, our research aims to harness the platform’s sensing
capabilities during the foraging season, specifically to
investigate the dynamics of the collective thermoregulation
of the broodnest and investigate the potential of inferring
population evolution (i.e., demographic forecasting). Further-
more, we are curious to discern whether there are specific
thermal cues that can influence the queen’s oviposition
location [114].
In this work, we have described the investigative potential
of a novel robotic system designed to interact with honeybee
colonies, highlighting the broader application of robotics
in studying large biological collectives within complex
biological contexts. The results of two extensive experiments
involving thousands of bees unmistakably demonstrate the
promise of this versatile platform for future research,
which we hope serves as an inspiration for new systems
studying collective thermobiology in other social insects
and potentially collectives from more distant taxonomic
groups. Our system not only streamlines the automation of
conventional experiments but also enables the exploration
of unique interactions with biological collectives, with the
capacity to enhance our comprehension of animal collective
behavior and their ecological interactions.
V. METHODS
A. ANIMALS, COLONIES, AND HIVES
In the course of this investigation, we utilized queenright
colonies of A. mellifera carnica Pollmann housed in Zander
box hives within the Botanical Garden of Graz apiary.
Experiments were conducted at the nearby field labora-
tory (47°4′58.15′′N, 15°27′25.00′′E), where colonies were
transferred from the box hives to observation hives with
dimensions w × h × d = 53 cm × 68 cm × 11 cm, which
could accommodate two vertical frames. To mimic the
dark environment of natural honeybee nests and minimize
disturbance, the field laboratory was maintained in darkness.
Bees had unrestricted access to the outside via a conduit
that connected the hive to the exterior, traversing the field
laboratory walls.
This study involved two distinct colonies. One, used in
the observation experiment (Sec. III-A), comprised roughly
4000 bees at the start of the experiment. This experiment,
which incorporated a robotic device at the bottom part of
the hive, spanned 121 days, from 01/08/2020 to 30/11/2020.
In the colony position modulation experiment (Sec. III-B),
we introduced a second colony with an initial estimated
population of 1200 bees. Conducted over 35 days, from
28/12/2022 to 01/02/2023, this experiment utilized two
robotic devices situated at the top and bottom sections of
the hive. The colonies were fed ad libitum, having free
access to a feeder positioned in the upper chamber of the
hives. During the warm months, colonies were fed with 73%
sucrose solution. During the colder months, the colonies
were fed a mixture of 25 parts sucrose, 6 parts honey,
and 7 parts water. This composition corresponds to the
standard feed mixture according to [115]. Bee welfare was
a priority throughout the study; Varroa mite treatments were
administered as necessary, even during experimental runs.
However, no Varroa treatments were needed during the period
of the data presented here.
Under Austrian legislation (Austrian Animal Experiments
Act – Tierversuchsgesetz 2012-TVG 2012, Section I, §1)
and the ethics committee of the University of Graz, insect
experimentation does not necessitate ethical approval. The
animals involved in this research received continuous care
from a professional beekeeper, who also assisted with the
experiments and manipulations detailed herein.
B. AUXILIARY SYSTEMS
Diverse supportive devices and procedures were used along-
side the robotic system and hives to gather auxiliary data,
improve data quality, or store collected data. In this study,
imagery played a crucial role in exploring patterns within
sensor data streams and understanding the structure and
organization of honeybee groups that produced this data (for
example Figures 5, 7, and 8). To avoid disrupting the natural
darkness within the beehives, we used infrared light illumi-
nation, a frequency band invisible to bees [116]. Images were
captured by Raspberry Pi High-Quality cameras equipped
50866
VOLUME 12, 2024
R. Barmak et al.: Biohybrid Superorganisms—On the Design of a Robotic System for Thermal Interactions
with a Sony IMX477 sensor featuring 12.3 megapixels and a
6-mm lens. For each robotic frame installed in an observation
hive, two cameras were used, one for each side of the frame.
The original acrylic windows of the observation hive were
substituted with non-reflective glass to diminish the reflection
from infrared illuminators. Each camera was connected to a
Raspberry Pi 4 Single-Board Computer (SBC) that managed
the shooting interval and stored the images on its SD card.
During warmer periods, when the Field Lab experienced
significant day-night thermal gradients, the wooden floor’s
slight expansion or contraction would marginally displace the
cameras. To counter this, we attached the observation hives
and cameras to a single five-centimeter thick tabletop.
In all experiments presented here, robotic frames were
controlled via a Raspberry Pi, which also functioned as
a local data storage system, saving all robotic data into
text files. Although not essential, this data was periodically
transmitted to an InfluxDB time-series database via the
Field Lab’s wireless network. The database centralized all
collected data and facilitated querying the data from multiple
colonies [117]. InfluxDB’s web interface enabled simple
dashboard creation and remote data visualization. For remote
control of the robotic frames or database access, the Field Lab
network was accessible through an encrypted SSH (Secure
Shell) connection.
A weather station (Ecowitt Eurochron EFWS 2900, with
temperature precision of 5% and resolution of 0.1 °C) was
used to monitor internal and external atmospheric conditions.
C. DATA ANALYSIS
1) STATISTICS
Throughout the text, if not explicitly stated otherwise,
metrics of central tendency and dispersion are calculated
by the median value and the median absolute difference,
MAD, for their robustness against outliers [118]. The
values representing measurements’ uncertainty depict the
combined uncertainty uc of the systematic and statistical
uncertainties of the experimental setup and the observed data
set. If not stated otherwise, the uncertainty values are written
after the symbol ‘‘±’’ and are calculated by summing in
quadrature the instrument(s) uncertainties and the sample set
median absolute difference, MAD (uc =
q
MAD2 + u2
inst).
Whenever sensors malfunctioned their data was removed
from the analyzed data set. In the observation experiment
(Sec. III-A), two sensors malfunctioned (n.31 and 46). During
the modulation experiment (Sec. III-B) one sensor (n.63)
from the bottom robot also malfunctioned. All data analysis
was performed in Python version 3.11.
2) RECREATING THERMAL FIELDS
In the default configuration, the system samples the sensor
array every 10 s. The sampling rate can be changed, by users
or automated scripts, without interrupting the system. Once
the system acquires the temperature values (Fig. 3b), they
are transmitted to a controller outside the hive (e.g., another
microcontrolled device, a single-board computer, or a laptop)
where data can be further processed and ingested into
databases or recorded in files. To reconstruct the thermal
fields from the sensor array, we used a radial basis function
method [119] to interpolate temperature values in steps of
1 mm.
3) IMAGE PROCESSING
To enhance the quality of the recorded images, a series
of treatments were applied, including the correction of
distortions introduced by the wide-view lens, adjustment of
perspective, cropping to focus on regions of interest, and
contrast enhancement through histogram equalization.
D. ETHICS OF MIXING ROBOTS AND BEES
As we previously discussed in [40], interactive robotic
systems involve close interactions and information exchange
with living animals [13], [120], prompting important ethical
considerations. In designing our non-invasive robotic systems
and conducting experiments, we aimed to minimize potential
adverse effects. For instance, to reduce animal stress, any
thermal stimuli emitted by the artificial agents were limited
to levels that naturally occur within a bee colony. Since
our technology can only be used within managed hives,
it will therefore only be in direct contact with honeybees
both during and after the device’s lifespan. Consequently,
its impact on the broader ecosystem is expected to be
negligible. However, the effects on the colony and species
as a whole should be considered. Our study used managed
honeybee colonies. Such bee colonies do not undergo
evolutionary adaptation by natural selection. In contrast,
their evolution is predominantly shaped by artificial selection
following bee-breeding principles [121] for traits like low
aggressiveness and high honey yield. If robotics help a weak,
perishing colony to thrive and reproduce, its feral offspring
without such support would be subject to natural selection,
i.e., without any further technological influence. Therefore,
we suggest that our robotic systems would have no long-term
effects on the evolution of feral honeybees.
