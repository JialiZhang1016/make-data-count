Summary
1. Corvids (crows, jays, magpies and nutcrackers) are important dispersers of large-seeded
plants. Studies on captive or supplemented birds suggest that they ﬂexibly adjust their scatter-
hoarding behaviour to the context of social dynamics and relative seed availability. Because
many corvid-dispersed trees show high annual variation in seed production, context-depen-
dent foraging can have strong effects on natural corvid scatter-hoarding behaviour.
2. We investigated how seed availability and social dynamics affected scatter-hoarding in the
island scrub jays (Aphelocoma insularis). We quantiﬁed rates of scatter-hoarding behaviour
and territorial defence of 26 colour-marked birds over a three-year period with variable acorn
crops.
3. We tested whether caching parameters were correlated with variation in annual seed pro-
duction of oaks as predicted by the predator dispersal hypothesis, which states that caching
rates and distances should vary with seed abundance in ways that beneﬁt tree ﬁtness. We also
tested whether antagonistic interactions with conspeciﬁcs would affect scatter-hoarding
adversely, as found in experimental studies.
4. Caching behaviour varied with acorn availability. Caching distances correlated positively
with annual acorn crop size, increasing by as much as 40% between years. Caching rates
declined over time in years with small acorn crops, but increased when crops were large.
Acorn foraging and caching rates were also negatively correlated with rates of territorial
aggression. Overall foraging rates, however, were not associated with aggression, suggesting
that reduced dispersal rates were not simply due to time constraints.
5. Our ﬁeld results support laboratory ﬁndings that caching rates and distances by scatter-
hoarding corvids are context-dependent. Furthermore, our results are consistent with predic-
tions of the predator dispersal hypothesis and suggest that large seed crops and social inter-
actions among scatter-hoarders affect dispersal beneﬁts for oaks and other masting tree
species.

Introduction
Seed dispersal is central to plant life history because it
lays the template for subsequent processes that determine
the spatial distribution of offspring (Howe & Miriti 2004).
For animal-dispersed plants, the frequency, distance and
arrival habitat of dispersed seeds depend on animal forag-
ing behaviour and movement. Disperser behaviour is
often context-dependent because it varies with seed avail-
ability, habitat conﬁguration, interactions among dis-
persers, predation pressure and the animal’s satiation or
motivational state (Pons & Pausas 2007; Levey, Tewks-
bury & Bolker 2008; C^ortes & Uriarte 2013). Identifying
contextual drivers of disperser behaviour is thus crucial to

understanding spatial seed dispersal patterns, especially
under
temporally
variable
conditions
(Cousens
et al.
2010). A majority of evidence for context-dependent seed
dispersal in scatter-hoarding birds, however, comes from
experimental studies or anecdotes because it is difﬁcult to
quantify in the ﬁeld (Pesendorfer et al. 2016a). Here, we
use behavioural ﬁeld observations of a scatter-hoarding
bird to investigate the context dependence of seed caching
across two temporally variable factors: seed availability
and social dynamics.
Scatter-hoarding
members
of
the
Corvidae
(crows,
jays, magpies and nutcrackers) are important seed dis-
persers for many large-seeded plants with strong annual
variation in seed crop size (Vander Wall & Beck 2012;
Pesendorfer et al. 2016a). Birds scatter-hoard seeds by
transporting them, often over long distances, and storing
them in small, spatially dispersed caches for later con-
sumption (Tomback 1982; Gomez 2003). Hoarder-dis-
persed trees, such as oaks (Quercus spp.) and pines
(Pinus spp.), typically produce highly variable numbers
of seeds per year, with cyclical bumper crops that are
spatially and temporally synchronized. This phenomenon
is known as masting or mast-fruiting (Koenig & Knops
2000; Kelly & Sork 2002). Circumstantial evidence sug-
gests that corvid caching behaviour is sensitive to natural
variation in seed availability. Johnson et al. (1997) report
low rates of scatter-hoarding by blue jays (Cyanocitta
cristata) in a year of low acorn productivity. Christensen,
Whitham & Balda (1991) used observations and experi-
ments
to
show
that
Clark’s
nutcrackers
(Nucifraga
columbiana) harvest a larger proportion of seeds from
pinyon pine (P. edulis) trees with higher numbers of pine
cones. The direct relationship between temporal variation
in seed availability and seed dispersal parameters, such
as caching rates and distances, has not been investigated
in wild corvids.
Two hypotheses for the functional basis of masting
make different predictions about the effect of variable
seed crops on seed dispersal. The well-supported ‘predator
satiation hypothesis’ states that bumper crops overwhelm
seed predators, thereby reducing the proportion of seeds
consumed by predators while increasing the proportion of
dispersed seeds (Silvertown 1980; Kelly & Sork 2002;
Espelta et al. 2008). The ‘predator dispersal hypothesis’
expands the predator satiation hypothesis and proposes
that bumper years not only affect the proportion of seeds
consumed, but also improve seed dispersal beneﬁts for the
plants (Vander Wall 2010). Increased dispersal beneﬁts
may result from various processes, including preferential
hoarding of larger seeds, or more frequent dispersal over
longer distances, but the underlying mechanisms are gen-
erally still poorly understood (Vander Wall 2002; Jansen,
Bongers & Hemerik 2004; Vander Wall & Beck 2012).
Because scatter-hoarders continue dispersing seeds even
when satiated, large crops both meet dispersers’ immedi-
ate food requirements and lead scatter-hoarders to cache
more
seeds
than
necessary
to
cover
energetic
costs
(Pesendorfer et al. 2016a). This would result in a larger
number of unrecovered seed caches at greater distances
from the source plant following high-productivity years
(Vander Wall & Beck 2012).
Quantitative studies of the effect of temporally variable
seed availability on scatter-hoarding behaviour have been
restricted to rodents and provide a mixed picture about
the relationship between seed abundance and seed disper-
sal. Some species increase dispersal rates in years of high
seed production (Vander Wall 2002), while others show
reduced dispersal rates (Jansen, Bongers & Hemerik 2004;
Li & Zhang 2007; Xiao, Zhang & Krebs 2013). Seed dis-
persal distances also vary with seed crop size. Some stud-
ies report increased distances in years of large crops
(Vander Wall 2002; Jansen, Bongers & Hemerik 2004; Li
& Zhang 2007), but dispersal distances can also decline
(Xiao, Zhang & Krebs 2013). Seed dispersal by scatter-
hoarding rodents thus appears to be generally sensitive to
seed abundance, but the affected parameters and the
direction of the response varies among the rodent systems
studied.
Social interactions have also been hypothesized to affect
scatter-hoarding behaviour. Studies of captive or food-
supplemented birds show that scatter-hoarders perform
cache protection behaviour when conspeciﬁcs are present,
including hiding food out of sight (Heinrich & Pepper
1998; Bugnyar et al. 2007), creating false caches or reduc-
ing caching rates (Dally, Clayton & Emery 2006; Toomey,
Bowman & Woolfenden 2007). Cache suppression by
social context is hypothesized to be the most effective
behaviour to reduce cache pilfering, because corvids use
observational spatial memory to retrieve caches they see
others make (Bugnyar et al. 2007). These ﬁndings suggest
the social environment shapes scatter-hoarding behaviour,
but we do not have data from unmanipulated, wild popu-
lations.
Here, we examine the ecological and social context of
scatter-hoarding in the island scrub jay, Aphelocoma insu-
laris, endemic to Santa Cruz Island, California. This
island provides a simpliﬁed system to investigate dispersal
dynamics because island scrub jays are the only scatter-
hoarding species present, and the majority of woody vege-
tation is dominated by two oak species, Q. paciﬁca and
Q. agrifolia (Junak et al. 1995). Our study has three
objectives. First, we quantify scatter-hoarding of acorns
by island scrub jays to describe natural caching rates and
distances. Secondly, we test whether jay scatter-hoarding
behaviour followed predictions of the predator dispersal
hypothesis. A signiﬁcant correlation between acorn counts
and dispersal parameters, such as caching rates and dis-
tances, would provide support for the hypothesis (Vander
Wall 2010). Thirdly, we tested the hypothesis that social
interactions inﬂuenced jay caching rates and distances.
We expected a negative correlation between antagonistic
interaction frequency and acorn caching behaviours, as
previously found for captive Aphelocoma (Dally, Clayton
& Emery 2006).

Materials and methods
data collection
Study site and acorn surveys
Fieldwork was conducted in fall (Sep – Dec) 2009–2011 on Santa
Cruz Island (34° 00 N, 119° 450 W), part of Channel Islands
National Park, California, USA. Located 40 km off the coast of
southern California, the island has a mediterranean climate with
cool wet winters and warm dry summers. All work was con-
ducted on three previously established study plots that spanned a
range of scrub-jay habitat quality (Fig. S1): Coches Prietos Can-
yon (115 ha), Field Station (226 ha) and Portezuela (163 ha).
Island scrub jays occur in chaparral habitat, where they occupy
home ranges of 35 ha  02 ha (mean  SE) with 63%  2%
cover of oak chaparral vegetation interspersed with open grass-
land and scrub vegetation (Sillett et al. 2012; Caldwell et al.
2013).
To monitor acorn availability, we conducted annual acorn
counts on 150 Q. paciﬁca and Q. agrifolia trees that were ran-
domly chosen across the three study plots in 2009 (see Pesendor-
fer et al. 2014 for details). These two species represent > 95% of
individual oaks on Santa Cruz Island (Junak et al. 1995). Two
observers counted all acorns detected in 15 s on each tree’s
crown, and their counts were summed. These ‘30-second acorn
counts’ are commonly used to measure the relative annual acorn
production of individual oaks (e.g. Koenig et al. 1994; Pesendor-
fer et al. 2014; Pesendorfer & Koenig 2016), and are thus a good
proxy for annual acorn production (Pons & Pausas 2012). Counts
were performed at the beginning of oak fruiting season when jays
were ﬁrst observed transporting acorns from oaks. Because island
scrub jays are the only animals that remove acorns from oaks on
Santa Cruz Island, we assumed that relative acorn availability
declined linearly with calendar week within each ﬁeld season
(Garcia & Ortiz-Pulido 2004; Espelta, Bonal & Sanchez-Humanes
2009; Pesendorfer & Koenig 2016).
Behavioural observations
We observed foraging and scatter-hoarding behaviour of col-
our-marked, territorial jays to quantify seed acquisition and
transportation. Birds were captured and ﬁtted with a unique
combination of four coloured leg bands and a unique USGS
numbered leg band (see Caldwell et al. 2013 and Langin et al.
2015 for details), following protocols approved by the National
Zoological Park’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Commit-
tee, the U.S. Geological Survey Bird Banding Lab, and the
California Department of Fish and Game. Like many island-
endemics, island scrub jays are relatively tame, and the low
stature of oak chaparral allows for reliable behavioural obser-
vation from vantage points. In 2009, 26 focal individuals in 13
territories (Fig. S1) were visited twice weekly to record oppor-
tunistic observations of one foraging and one caching event
per individual following 5 min of acclimation. We expanded our
effort to include the study of behavioural rates in 2010 and 2011.
This entailed 30-min observations on the same focal individuals
studied in 2009 (henceforth referred to as ‘focal follows’). We
recorded all foraging and caching behaviour, as well as social
interactions (Altmann 1974) observed between 07.00 and 15.00 h;
start times for each individual varied throughout ﬁeld seasons.
Observations began after 5 min of acclimation time once a bird
was located, and terminated whenever a bird was out of sight for
more than 10 min. Only follows longer than 5 min were used for
analysis.
The behavioural data collected during focal follows included
foraging and caching events, as well as territorial aggression.
Data for foraging observations included the behaviour used to
acquire food (e.g. glean, or sally), food type, plant species and
whether the acquired item was consumed or cached (i.e. dis-
persed). Observations were considered a single foraging event if
the bird manipulated the same location repeatedly in sequence
(e.g. four pecks to remove a piece of bark), but separate events
if the same action was applied to areas more than 10 cm apart.
If a bird cached a food item, we recorded, if possible, the type
of item, the species of the cached seed, transportation distance,
seed arrival habitat type, as well as the presence of another jay
that could potentially observe the caching. Caching distances
<100 m were estimated by eye. Longer distances were measured
with laser range ﬁnders. Distances above 100 m were recorded
to the closest 10 m, and all observations were recorded on digi-
tal voice recorders. Whenever the view of a bird was obstructed
so that observation of a foraging action was impossible, the
bird was considered out of sight. Rates of foraging and disper-
sal were calculated as the number of events observed during the
time a bird was in sight, scaled to hourly rates. Displacements
of conspeciﬁcs, the most common antagonistic interactions, were
obvious to observers and often followed by conspicuous chases
over long distances. Displacement rates h1 were therefore cal-
culated for the whole duration of a follow.
The signiﬁcant variation in acorn counts between plots and
years (Fig. S2; Pesendorfer et al. 2014), as well as the daily varia-
tion in displacement rates, allowed us to test whether jay foraging
and caching behaviour varied with acorn availability and con-
speciﬁc aggression. We included Calendar Week as proxy for
within-season decline in acorn availability, because the decline in
acorn availability tends to be linear within the fall season
(Pesendorfer & Koenig 2016).
statistical analysis
We used an information theoretic approach to determine the
relationship between context variables and caching behaviour
(Burnham & Anderson 2002). First, we constructed a global
LMM for each dependent variable, with context parameters and
their ﬁrst-order interactions as ﬁxed effects (see below). All
models included Individual nested in Plot as a random effect to
control for both repeated sampling and non-independence in the
use of the same habitat. All regressors were standardized by
rescaling to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 05 to facili-
tate the biological interpretation of interactions of ﬁxed effects
(Schielzeth 2010; Gelman & Su 2015). We used model selection
to determine whether a single model best ﬁts the data. Because
none of the models achieved model weight > 09, we calculated
model-averaged parameter estimates, their 95% conﬁdence inter-
vals and relative importance for all ﬁxed effects across models
with DAIC < 4. This provides a conservative estimate of stan-
dardized parameters and their signiﬁcance as determined by the
overlap of the 95% CI with 0 (Grueber et al. 2011). All statisti-
cal analyses were performed in R version 322 (R Development
Core Team 2015). Linear mixed models were constructed in
lme4 (Bates et al. 2014), standardized with arm (Gelman & Su

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License
2015), followed by model selection and averaging in MuMIn
(Barton 2015).
To determine whether foraging and caching rates varied with
acorn availability and territorial aggression, we modelled the
relationship between behavioural rates (overall foraging rate
h1, acorn foraging rate h1, acorn caching rate h1) during
focal follows (n = 262) and context parameters (acorn count,
calendar week and displacement rate). We present standardized
parameter estimates, their 95% conﬁdence intervals and relative
variable importance. The predicted, model-averaged relationship
between acorn caching rates and within-season acorn availabil-
ity are plotted for each study plot/year combination.
We also modelled the relationship between caching distances
and context parameters. First, we determined whether caching
distances varied with acorn availability within and between ﬁeld
seasons. Here, we used the data set of all valid caching observa-
tions, collected ad libitum and during focals (n = 791). The data
are comparable for several reasons; they were collected on the
same individuals over the whole time period, only that fewer
caching observations were recorded in 2009, and we avoided a
bias for highly visible dispersal events (i.e. over long distances)
by spending a 5-min waiting period after ﬁnding the animal.
Caching distances followed a Gamma distribution and were thus
log-transformed (log(x + 1)) to approach normality in errors
and modelled as a function of acorn count and calendar week.
Secondly, we investigated whether caching distances were associ-
ated with behavioural rates during focal follows. To do so, we
constructed a model of caching distances of caches observed
during focal follows (n = 339), with acorn foraging, acorn cach-
ing and displacement rates, as well as acorn count and calendar
week as ﬁxed effects. Here, we did not include interactions
between parameters, as none of the additional ﬁxed effects were
signiﬁcant predictors on their own.
Results
behavioural observations
We collected 888 caching and 3403 foraging observa-
tions
over
the
three
ﬁeld
seasons.
The
jays
cached
acorns almost exclusively (879 observations; 99%), but
we also observed the caching of two arthropods, four
manzanita
berries
(Arctostaphylos
spp.),
one
wild
cucumber seed (Marah macrocarpus), one island cherry
(Prunus ilicifolia) and one lemonade berry fruit (Rhus
integrifolia). In 2009, we recorded opportunistic observa-
tions of 395 foraging and 245 caching events. During
the 2010 and 2011 ﬁeld seasons, we recorded 389 focal
follows
for
26
individual
birds,
262
of
which
also
included data on aggressive interactions. We recorded
an average ( SE) of 55  02 follows per individual
in 2010 and 97  02 follows per individual in 2011.
Mean follow length was 22 min 36 s ( 23 s), and the
birds were in sight for an average of 12 min 5 s ( 15
s). Birds were in sight for 547  14% of the duration
of focal follows in 2010, and for 600  12% in 2011
and performed 25  03 displacements, 385  28 for-
aging manoeuvres and 72  05 caches per hour.
context dependence of behavioural rates
Overall foraging rates did not vary signiﬁcantly with
acorn
availability
or
displacement
rates.
No
context
parameters were signiﬁcant predictors of hourly foraging
rates (Table 1a). Furthermore, model selection indicated
that no model ﬁt the data better than the null model, that
is overall foraging rates did not vary with the context we
measured (Table S1).
In contrast, acorn foraging and caching rates declined
with calendar week (our proxy for within-season variation
in seed availability), but only when initial acorn availabil-
ity on the plots was low (LMM interaction acorn count 9
cal.
week;
foraging:
B = 0145  0056;
caching
B = 5958  2120). The interaction between acorn count
and calendar week showed high relative variable impor-
tance and was a signiﬁcant predictor of both acorn forag-
ing rates and acorn caching rates (Table 1b and 1c).
Model-predicted acorn caching rates increased with calen-
dar week in the two study plots with large acorn crops
(FS and PZ) in 2010, while they declined over the same
period when annual acorn crops were low: CPC plot in
2010, and all plots in 2011 (Fig. 1a). The slope of the
relationship between calendar week and caching rates
changed from 0998 under the lowest acorn availability
(acorn count = 09) to 0941 when acorns were abundant
(acorn count = 199; Fig. 1a). The birds’ scatter-hoarding
behaviour
therefore
varied
systematically
with
acorn
availability, as predicted by the predator dispersal hypoth-
esis.
Territorial aggression also affected acorn foraging and
caching rates. Both rates correlated negatively with dis-
placement
rates
during
focals
(acorn
foraging
B = 0480  1118; acorn caching: B = 2319  0983),
and displacement rate was a signiﬁcant predictor with
high relative variable importance (Table 1b–c). Jays effec-
tively stopped caching acorns when rates of territorial
aggression were high (Fig. 2).
context dependence of caching distance
Dispersal distances of acorns varied signiﬁcantly with
acorn availability, but not with acorn foraging or dis-
placement
rates.
Overall,
jays
transported
acorns
385  16 m,
with
a

distance
of
400 m
(Fig. 1b). The analysis of all observed caching distances
indicated that dispersal distances correlated positively
with acorn counts (LMM for log-transformed caching

Discussion
Our ﬁndings demonstrate that scatter-hoarding behaviour
by island scrub jays is highly context-dependent. Acorn
caching varied systematically with the highly variable
acorn crops; caching rates increased, and distances were
higher in years with greater acorn availability, while in
years of low acorn crops, caching rates declines rapidly,
and caching distances declined as much as 40%. These
results are consistent with predictions of the predator dis-
persal hypothesis, which posits that, in addition to satiat-
ing seed predators, large seed crops of masting tree
species may enhance long-distance dispersal by scatter-
hoarding corvids (Vander Wall 2002, 2010). Furthermore,
acorn foraging and caching rates declined with increased
territorial
aggression,
while
overall
foraging
activity
remained stable (Table 1, Fig. 2). This result suggests a
connection between social dynamics and scatter-hoarding
behaviour that has not been previously demonstrated
under natural conditions. Combined, our ﬁndings under-
score the context dependence of seed dispersal by scatter-
hoarding corvids, and provide clues about the complex
interactions between plant and animal behaviour that
determine the outcome of seed dispersal interactions.
island scrub jays as seed dispersers for oaks
Our results emphasize the central ecological role of island
scrub jays on Santa Cruz Island, which has a reduced
number of oak seed predators and dispersers when com-
pared to mainland California (Morrison et al. 2011).
Extrapolating the observed caching rate of 72 acorns
hour1 to a whole fruiting season of oaks (~ 110 d), indi-
vidual island scrub jays cache 3500 (range: 2750–5000)
acorns per year, assuming the birds forage for ﬁve hours
a day. The population of island scrub jays, recently esti-
mated at 2270 individuals (Sillett et al. 2012), could thus
cache more than 7 million acorns year1 on Santa Cruz
Island.
The jays’ hoarding behaviour affected the spatial dis-
tribution
of
dispersed
acorns.
The
birds
transported
acorns for an average of 385 m and up to 400 m before
they were cached in the ground. Such dispersal is likely
a key symbiotic beneﬁt that oaks receive from scatter-
hoarding birds, and the spatial signature of such seed
dispersal was also reﬂected in the reconstruction of oak
habitat expansion on Sant Cruz Island (Dahlin, Asner &
Field 2014).

context-dependent scatter-hoarding
Oaks on Santa Cruz Island received increased seed disper-
sal beneﬁts from scatter-hoarding jays when acorn crops
were large. Our ﬁnding that caching rates and distances
varied systematically with acorn availability support pre-
dictions of the predator dispersal hypothesis, which states
that variable production of large seed crops by oaks has a
function beyond satiation of seed predators. We found
that mean caching distances in study plots increased by as
much as 40% when acorns were abundant (Fig. 1b),
based on annual October acorn surveys, and that caching
rates by the jays changed with variation in acorn crops.
Our ﬁndings therefore suggest that the context depen-
dence of seed dispersal on seed abundance can signiﬁ-
cantly affect seed dispersal beneﬁts trees receive from
scatter-hoarding corvids.
The variation in dispersal rates with the social context
of territorial aggression could point to a more complex,
indirect effect of acorn crop variation on scatter-hoarding.
As hypothesized, acorn foraging and caching rates corre-
lated negatively with territorial aggression while caching

distance remained unchanged. This result echoes ﬁndings
from studies with captive or provisioned western scrub
jays in which rates of scatter-hoarding behaviour were
negatively affected by the presence of conspeciﬁc competi-
tors (Dally, Clayton & Emery 2006; Toomey, Bowman &
Woolfenden 2007). This effect of social context is hypoth-
esized to reduce cache pilferage by competing conspeciﬁcs
(Bugnyar et al. 2007). Interestingly, displacement rates in
our study were not correlated with acorn availability (re-
sults not shown), suggesting that other factors, such as
the number of non-breeders in the population, may drive
territorial aggression (Carmen 2004). Moreover, recent
work has shown that the mean winter abundance of scrub
jays across California is correlated with the state-wide
acorn crop preceding the previous winter (Koenig et al.
2009). Therefore, the variation in acorn production of
oaks could affect the rate of seed dispersal indirectly by
affecting local population density of jays and thus territo-
rial aggression. Combined, the predator dispersal effects
and social interactions among conspeciﬁcs may further
increase the year-to-year variation in seed dispersal rates
by jays.
This study was based on observational data collected
over three years and thus has caveats that limit inference
and highlight directions for future work. First, we tested
masting-related hypotheses with acorn survey data, but we
did not actually observe a mast year. Longer term studies
are needed to conﬁrm the patterns we describe here. We
also assumed that acorn crops decline linearly with calen-
dar, but our study was not designed to quantify changes in
acorn crop sizes within seasons. Recent work on different
California oak species, however, suggests that acorn crops
decline linearly on trees when jays are the main dispersers,
and that the slope of decline depends on initial crop size
(Pesendorfer & Koenig 2016). We attempted to account
for a linear decline in acorn availability by including an
interaction between annual acorn count and calendar week
in our models. However, studies explicitly designed to
measure seasonal acorn availability would be useful.
Finally, this study cannot identify the mechanisms under-
lying correlations between acorn crop size, jay social
dynamics and seed dispersal parameters. Future experi-
ments should examine the mechanisms underlying context
dependence of corvid seed dispersal by manipulating acorn
crops. Because many aspects of seed dispersal by scatter-
hoarding birds are still poorly understood, such experi-
ments would provide important contributions to the excit-
ing ﬁeld of dispersal ecology.
