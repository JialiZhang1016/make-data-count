Aniline–phenol recognition is studied in the crystal engineering context in
several 1:1 cocrystals that contain a closed cyclic hydrogen-bonded [  O—
H  N—H  ]2 tetramer supramolecular synthon (II). Twelve cocrystals of 3,4,5-
and 2,3,4-trichlorophenol with one of eight halogenated anilines have been
characterized. Ten of these cocrystals contain an extended octamer synthon that
is assembled with hydrogen bonding and    stacking that deﬁnes a Long-
Range Synthon Aufbau Module (LSAM). The design strategy is, therefore,
based on the construction and transferability of the LSAM, which is a dimer of
tetramers. Using the LSAM concept, two short cell axes in the crystal structures
can be predicted. Whilst one of them is dictated by synthon II, the other one is
dominated by    interactions. The third cell axis can also be predicted, in
some cases, by systematic tuning of the halogen bonds. The design strategy is
also veriﬁed in cocrystals of non-halogenated precursors. The observation of this
large synthon in so many structures points to its stability and possible existence
in solution. To this end, one-dimensional 1H and 15N NMR studies, performed
on the 3,4,5-trichlorophenol–3,5-dichloroaniline cocrystal in CDCl3, show
characteristic downﬁeld shifts that point to a    stacked structure and to
the robustness of the hydrogen-bonded aggregates. Nuclear Overhauser effects
point to hydrogen bonding between aniline and phenol molecules in the
aggregates. Diffusion-ordered spectroscopy and T1 inversion recovery experi-
ments show that stacking is present in concentrated solution and lost at a certain
dilution. A sequence of events is therefore established: molecules of the aniline
and the phenol associate via hydrogen bonding to form tetramers, and tetramers
subsequently stack to form octamers.
1. Introduction
The study of aniline–phenol recognition, in the context of crystal engineering and
supramolecular synthons, has been an unusually complex exercise, considering the small
size and relative simplicity of the —NH2 and —OH functional groups. At the ﬁrst level,
only the hydrogen-bonding capabilities of the amino and hydroxyl groups appear to be
important; Ermer & Eling (1994) and Hanessian et al. (1994, 1995, 1999) independently
predicted that in systems with an equal stoichiometry of —OH and —NH2 groups, there
are equal numbers of O—H  N and N—H  O hydrogen bonds, leading to tetrahedral
conﬁgurations at both N and O atoms. Allen et al. (1997) showed, however, that this
seemingly simple model, which was applied to 4-aminophenol by Ermer, ignores the
herringbone interactions of the phenyl rings, as seen in the N—H  -based structures of
2- and 3-aminophenol. The appearance of N—H   interactions in many of these
structures is a manifestation of interference between hydrocarbon residues and the
hydrogen-bonding groups (Desiraju, 2001). This is a real issue in many aminophenols.
Vangala et al. (2003) demonstrated that 3-aminophenol is a prototype and that an entire
family of methylene-linked aminophenols can be understood as a balance between the
inﬁnite   O—H  N—H   synthon and various hydrocarbon interactions, including the
non-conventional N—H   hydrogen bond. Also described by them is the concept of
synthon evolution which may be examined in systems of large
enough size and complexity. Dey et al. (2005) hinted at the
importance of large synthons (containing both hydrogen
bonds and C—H   herringbone interactions) in the context
of crystallization mechanisms in a crystal structure prediction
of isomeric methyl aminophenols. The conjoining of hydrogen
bonds and hydrocarbon interactions leads to an increase in
both complexity and size of certain important synthons in this
system and these have been referred to as Long Range
Synthon Aufbau Modules (LSAM) by Ganguly & Desiraju
(2010). These guidelines apply equally well to multi-compo-
nent systems: Vangala et al. (2004) studied a series of diani-
line–diphenol molecular complexes or cocrystals in this
regard. Desiraju (2013) suggested recently that the so-called
large synthons or LSAMs in the aminophenols could be a
sought-after bridge between small synthons and crystal growth
units.
Intermolecular association and aggregation in solution may
be probed by NMR spectroscopic methods in a facile manner
(Spitaleri et al., 2004; Chiarella et al., 2007; Chadwick et al.,
2009; Schneider, 2009). The most direct evidence for mole-
cular association/aggregation comes from perturbations in
chemical shifts () between the free and the associated form of
interacting solutes (Saito et al., 2002; Spitaleri et al., 2004).
Perturbations in chemical shifts arise from differences in the
magnetic environment that the nuclear spins experience in the
free and associated forms. Molecular association may also be
inferred from other well established NMR parameters such as
the spin-lattice relaxation time constants (T1) (a measure of
the time required for the nuclear spins under investigation to
return to thermal equilibrium after a perturbation) (Claridge,
2008) and from estimates of translational diffusion coefﬁcients
(Ds) (Diffusion Ordered Spectroscopy, DOSY, is an experi-
mental method designed to estimate the translational diffu-
sion coefﬁcient of solutes) (Barjat et al., 1995; Cohen et al.,
2005). The magnitude of Nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE)
enhancement is dependent on the fact that the distance of
separation between the nuclear magnetic moments must lie
within 5 A˚ (Neuhaus & Williamson, 2000). Fortunately, the
weak forces that stabilize intermolecular interactions such as
hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interactions, hydrophobic
interactions or salt bridges act over short distances. Thus, the
existence of intermolecular associations may be established by
assignment of the NOE between the interacting species. The
longitudinal relaxation rates are sensitive to the rotational
correlation time (c) and thus proportional to the molecular
size. Similarly, the translational diffusion coefﬁcient is also
proportional to the molecular size. A signiﬁcant advantage of
solution NMR methods lies in their ability to explore asso-
ciation/aggregation properties of solutes as a function of
solute concentration, and whether or not association/aggre-
gation occurs.
With this background, we initiated a study of the crystal
chemistry of a series of phenol–aniline cocrystals based mostly
on 3,4,5-trichlorophenol, 1, and halogenated anilines, 3–10.
Phenol 1 has a highly modular crystal structure that may be
developed (unusually) from the crystal structures of 4-
chlorophenol and 3,5-dichlorophenol (Mukherjee & Desiraju,
2011). It must be noted here that modularity is an inherent
property of supramolecular synthons and, in that sense, every
crystal structure has certain modular features. However, as
weak interactions play a major role at the end stages of
crystallization, this modularity is often restricted to the
primary synthon level. The unusual feature of phenol 1 is that
it shows the rare phenomenon of modularity at a large synthon
level. This type of modularity is indicative of high structural
insulation, which is useful for the type of study performed
here. The family of structures studied here, therefore, lends
itself particularly well to the principles of crystal engineering
and also provides an opportunity for the study of large
synthons in solution and their evaluation as intermediates
during crystallization.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis and single-crystal X-ray diffraction
The cocrystals were prepared generally via solvent drop
grinding (see supporting information for details), except those
with 3-chloroaniline, which is a liquid at ambient conditions.
Single crystals were obtained mostly by solvent evaporation
except in a few cases where crystals were obtained by subli-
mation. The details of the crystallization procedure for each
cocrystal are given in the supporting information. After
obtaining crystals of suitable size and quality, single-crystal X-
ray data were collected on a Rigaku Mercury375R/M CCD
(XtaLAB
mini)
diffractometer
using
graphite-mono-
chromated Mo K radiation. The instrument was attached to a
Rigaku low-temperature gas-spray cooler. The data were
processed with the CrystalClear software (Rigaku, 2009).

Structure solution and reﬁnements were performed using
SHELX97 incorporated within the WinGX suite (Sheldrick,
2008; Farrugia, 1999).
2.2. Database studies
A search of the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD,
Version 5.34, with updates to May 2013; Allen, 2002) was
performed to ﬁnd crystal structures which contain both aniline
and phenol residues. The search was restricted according to
the following criteria: three-dimensional structures deter-
mined, R < 0.075, not disordered, no errors, not polymeric, no
ions, no powder structures, only organics. The resulting
structures were analysed manually to identify synthon
patterns and their relative frequencies.
2.3. NMR spectroscopic techniques
NMR spectra were acquired on Bruker 400 or 500 MHz
NMR spectrometers or on an Agilent 600 MHz NMR spec-
trometer. All spectra were acquired at 298 K. A 1H spectral
width of 10 p.p.m. was sampled at all ﬁeld strengths. A 13C
spectral width of 100 p.p.m. was sampled at all ﬁeld strengths.
One-dimensional 15N spectra were recorded at 600 MHz at
natural abundance, using a spectral width of 12 019 Hz. Urea
(BrukerBiospin Standard, 0.1 M 15N-urea in dimethyl sulf-
oxide) was taken as a reference compound. A total of 64, 8192,
16 384 and 81 920 transients were recorded for the urea
reference, and for samples A, E and F (see below). During
acquisition, a 5 kHz ﬁeld was applied to achieve proton
decoupling. 15N chemical shifts are referenced to external DSS
(Cavanagh et al., 2007). 1H and 13C chemical shifts are refer-
enced to internal TMS (0.0 p.p.m.) and CDCl3 (solvent,
77 p.p.m.), respectively.
2.3.1. Sample preparation. 3,4,5-Trichlorophenol and 3,5-
dichloroaniline were taken in a 1:1 molar ratio and ground
together in a mortar to obtain cocrystal 14. The resulting
powder was dissolved in CDCl3 to obtain a concentration of
1.25 M. This concentration is taken as the starting point in the
dilution study and is called A. This solution was then diluted
gradually from A to B (1 M) to C (0.8 M) to D (0.7 M) to E
(0.625 M) and ﬁnally to F (0.125 M). Solutions of 1,2,3-
trichlorobenzene were prepared in a similar manner from a
stock solution (1.25 M) and labelled A1 to F1.
2.3.2. Chemical shift perturbation. One-dimensional NMR
spectra of solutions A to F (14) and A1 to F1 (1,2,3-
trichlorobenzene) were recorded on the Bruker 400 MHz
NMR spectrometer using a BBI probe ﬁtted with a single (z-
axis) pulsed ﬁeld gradient (PFG) accessory. All spectra were
processed using TopSpin 3.2 software (Bruker, 2014).
2.3.3. Estimation of longitudinal relaxation time constants
(T1). Data for T1 estimation of 13C in samples of A, E and F
(14) and A1, E1 and F1 (1,2,3-trichlorobenzene) were acquired
using the T1 inversion recovery method (Claridge, 2008). Data
were acquired on the Bruker 500 MHz spectrometer using a
TXI probe ﬁtted with a z-axis PFG accessory and the Agilent
600 MHz NMR spectrometer using an IDTRPFG probe ﬁtted
with a z-axis gradient accessory. Interscan delays of 15 and 25 s
were maintained at 500 and 600 MHz, respectively. 13C T1
values were measured from spectra recorded with 25 different
durations of the recovery delay at 500 MHz:  = 50, 100,
500 ms, 1.0–8.0 s in steps of 0.5, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 25 s. T1
values at 600 MHz were measured from 13 different durations
of the recovery delay for sample A:  = 100, 500 ms, 1.0–5.0 s in
steps of 0.5, 7.5 and 10 s; and from 11 different durations of the
recovery delay for samples E and F:  = 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10,
12.5, 15 and 20 s. Spectra were processed using the VnmrJ
3.2A software (Agilent, 2012). The peak heights were ﬁtted to
the equation
It ¼ I0 þ A expðt=T1Þ;
where It is the peak height at time t, I0 is the peak height at t =
0 and A is a constant. T1 values were calculated using peak-
ﬁtting routines in VnmrJ 3.2A.
2.3.4. Difference NOE experiments. Difference NOE
spectra (Neuhaus & Williamson, 2000) on solutions A, E and F
(14) and A1, E1 and F1 (1,2,3-trichlorobenzene) were acquired
on the Agilent 600 MHz NMR spectrometer using the
IDTRPFG probe ﬁtted with a z-axis PFG accessory. Low
power saturation was applied for 3 s followed by data acqui-
sition. In the case of the no-saturation experiment, the
transmitter was placed at 2 p.p.m. A relaxation delay of 25 s
was maintained between transients.
2.3.5. Estimation of translational diffusion coefficients.
Translational diffusion coefﬁcients were measured using the
one-dimensional DOSY bipolar pulsed pair gradient stimu-
lated echo experiment (Stejskal & Tanner, 1965; Johnson,
1999) on the Agilent 600 MHz NMR spectrometer. All spectra
were acquired using the IDTRPFG probe ﬁtted with a z-axis
PFG accessory. Data were acquired at three values of the
diffusion delay (75, 85 and 100 ms) for gradient strengths
(G cm1) of 2.10, 2.73, 4.62, 10.07, 18.55, 25.02, 30.60, 35.29,
39.43, 43.18, 46.63, 49.84, 52.85, 55.70, 58.41, 61.00, 63.49, 65.88
and 68.20. A relaxation delay of 25 s was maintained between
successive transients. Bipolar pulsed ﬁeld gradients were
applied for a total duration of 2 ms and a gradient recovery
delay time of 500 ms introduced prior to application of RF
pulses. Spectra were processed using VnmrJ 32A software. The
translational diffusion coefﬁcient (D) was obtained by ﬁtting
to the equation
IG ¼ IG¼0 exp½ðGÞ2Dð  =3  g=2Þ;
where IG is the observed signal intensity, IG=0 is the signal
intensity in the absence of the gradient spin-echo, G is the
gradient strength (Gauss cm1), D is the diffusion coefﬁcient
(m2 s1),  is the gyromagnetic ratio of the observed nucleus,
g is the gradient recovery delay (s),  is the diffusion time (s)
and  is the duration of the gradient pulse (s).
3. Results and discussion
The supramolecular synthons referred to in this study are
shown in Fig. 1. The main patterns are synthons I and II.
Synthon I, which is an inﬁnite open   O—H  N—H  
chain, is the most common pattern in the family and is found in

both 3- and 4-aminophenol prototypes. In 3-aminophenol, the
second ‘free’ N—H group is involved in an N—H   inter-
action. In 4-aminophenol, the inﬁnite chains criss-cross each
other to give closed hexamers, III, with a cooperative [  O—
H  N—H  ]3 arrangement. The main closed pattern in the
family is the tetramer synthon II, [  O—H  N—H  ]2,
which is the target synthon in the present study.

† Structures 20 and 22 are reported using their formal reduced cells, which have obtuse rather than acute angles. The cells are nonetheless comparable with those of 11, 15, 16, 17, 18 and
21; all of these cocrystals are essentially isostructural.
3.1. Aniline–phenol recognition: general considerations
A CSD study was performed to examine aniline–phenol
recognition in aromatic compounds. A total of 176 hits were
obtained that contain both aniline (—NH2) and phenol
(—OH) fragments. Of this number, 77 (44%) contain O—
H  N hydrogen bonds, the strongest hydrogen bond possible
in this family. These 77 hits may be divided into 48 single-
component and 29 multi-component structures. Analysis of
the 48 single-component structures shows that 19 have the 3-
aminophenol structure. Ten structures take the 4-aminophenol
structure, which includes synthon III. Synthon III arises due to
the compatibility between geometric and chemical factors of
the —OH and —NH2 groups at the 1- and 4-positions of the
aromatic ring. In the 3-aminophenol structure, the positional
compatibility between —NH2 and —OH is lost, and geome-
trical factors play a major role in determining the ﬁnal
herringbone structure. As a result, the synthon pattern devi-
ates from III and an additional N—H   interaction is
observed in this structure. The structure of 3-aminophenol is
indicative of the fact that if the cooperativity between —NH2
and —OH groups is perturbed, the synthon pattern deviates
from synthon III. Seven structures have the closed tetramer
structure, II, while three have inﬁnite   O—H  N—H  
chains (synthon I) without N—H   interactions. The
remaining nine structures show interaction interference:
absence of N—H  O [CSD refcodes AMNPHA (Haisa et al.,
1980), NODTIJ (Blagden et al., 2001) and HIWNEH
(Largeron et al., 2008)]; ﬁnite chains [CSD refcodes GIVRIM
(Mahmoud et al., 1998), SADJAK (Kar et al., 2010),
UHEVOT (Bacchi et al., 2009) and WURNHZ (Lu et al.,
2010)]; hexamer synthon composed of O—H  N, N—H  O,
O—H  O, N—H  N [CSD refcodes PEJCAJand PEJCAJ01
(Dey & Desiraju, 2006)].
The 29 multi-component structures are distinct in that 14 of
them are quite free from interference from other functional-
ities and show clear structural preferences. Ten of them have
the [  O—H  N—H  ]3 hexamer in the 4-aminophenol
structure and three have the [  O—H  N—H  ]2 tetramer
(Van Bellingen et al., 1971). The inﬁnite   O—H  N—H  
chain, without N—H   interactions and without hexamers,
is seen in one structure. Generally, the multi-component
crystals take the 4-aminophenol structure; the tetramer is
uncommon and other outlier structures are rarely seen. Could
it be that the very formation of a multi-component crystal is
already accompanied in the early stages with a funnelling into
a certain pathway that is mediated by   O—H  N—H  
hydrogen bonding? The following observations on the ten
tetramer structures (seven single-component and three multi-
component) are relevant: (i) in all three multi-component
crystals [CSD refcodes FIDLIO, FIDLOU (Vangala et al.,
2004) and SARLEC (Loehlin et al., 1998)], the aniline
contains more than one —NH2 group and/or the phenol
contains more than one —OH group; (ii) in ﬁve of the seven
single-component crystals,    interactions (stacking of
aromatic rings) are present. With these observations, we
attempted to formulate a design strategy for aniline–phenol
cocrystals that would lend themselves to NMR study in solu-
tion, in order that the presence of large synthons (LSAMs)
might be detected in solution prior to crystallization. A
synthon consisting of both hydrogen-bonded and -stacked
regions, as shown in Fig. 2, was identiﬁed as one such strategy.
3.2. Aniline–phenol recognition: crystal engineering
3.2.1. Design strategy for cocrystals. The ability to antici-
pate packing patterns in crystal structures based on known
structures is a daunting task when the database of known
structures is small. It is even more difﬁcult to design structures
that are based on synthons which are not the most common
ones in the respective family. CSD studies showed that
tetramer structures are not the most common but that they
may be favoured when there is an additional stability from
   stacking (Hunter & Sanders, 1990). Given that we were
searching for a synthon of the type shown in Fig. 2, our
attention shifted naturally to synthon II. The design of
aniline–phenol cocrystals based on synthon II is difﬁcult
because the aromatic rings can themselves be a part of a
synthon (say with N—H  ) and interfere with other func-
tionalities, notably the —NH2 group. Therefore, successful
design of crystal structures containing synthon II may need
steering groups which can form strong    interactions that
may eventually decrease the interference from the rest of the
molecule (Desiraju et al., 2011). In this context, we chose 3,4,5-
trichlorophenol, 1, as the main compound in this study. The
2,3,4 isomer, 2, was also used in some experiments. In 1, the
phenolic —OH group and the Cl atoms are well separated.
The electron-deﬁcient nature of the aromatic ring was also
expected to favour    stacking. For steric and electronic
reasons, phenol 1 was selected for cocrystallization with
several halogenated anilines in order to obtain recurring
packing patterns in the respective cocrystals. The coformers
used are anilines 3–10.
Phenol 1 was taken with 4-chloroaniline (3) in 1:1 n-
hexane–MeOH in an equimolar ratio to give cocrystal 11
(Table 1). The primary synthon in this structure is the desired
closed tetramer II (Fig. 3a) which consists of alternating
aniline and phenol molecules. The aniline ring is tilted at an
angle of 53.4 to the phenol ring. The phenol rings in adjacent
tetramers are stacked in an antiparallel manner roughly down
the a axis (Fig. 3b). The stacked dimer (octamer) in Fig. 3(b) is
of great importance because it corresponds to the LSAM that
is monitored with NMR in the second part of this study. The
extended structure propagates in a sort of double layer that is
aligned along [210] as shown in Fig. 3(c). The double layers are
themselves loosely associated in the c-axis direction with
halogen atom interactions (Fig. 3d). The periphery of the
double layer is halogen-rich.
Synthon II was expected to be of high modularity. The
chloro-substitution pattern of the aniline may change the
width of the module slightly but its length remains almost the
same because it is a function of the molecular size of phenol 1.
This means that cocrystals that may be obtained when phenol
1 is taken with other related anilines should have nearly the

same crystal structure as 11 with the a and b axes practically
the same (within a particular crystal system or space group),
and with the c axis varying slightly depending on the substi-
tution pattern in the aniline. This expectation was borne out in
practice (Table 1).
3.2.2. Significance of LSAMs. Crystal engineering seeks a
modular way to describe a structure. Transfer of smaller
structural units (synthons, LSAMs) simpliﬁes the complex task
of comparing interaction strengths to one of putting structural
modules together. To this end, and analogous to the Aufbau
modules
proposed
originally
by
Kitaigorodskii
(1961),
Ganguly & Desiraju (2010) proposed the concept of the
LSAM. In this notation, a crystal can be dissected into long-
range larger synthons which are modular and therefore the
crystal structure can be described by different arrangements of
these modules. Long-range synthons can be formed by various
combinations of different small/large synthons. In the context
of this paper, we consider O—H  N and N—H  O as the
primary synthons, the tetramer synthon (II) as the larger
secondary synthon and a combination of two tetramers
through    interactions as the
octamer LSAM. One of the objec-
tives of this work is to ﬁnd out how
the LSAMs can be transferred from
one structure to another and how
this transferability contributes to the
overall predictability of the crystal
structures. The cocrystallization of 1
with 4, 6 and 7 produced cocrystals
12,
14
and
15,
respectively.
As
hypothesized in the preceding para-
graph,
all
four
structures
adopt
structures similar to that of 11 (Fig.
4).
In cocrystal 12, the change in
position of the Cl atom on the aniline
periphery causes a structural varia-
tion in the long direction. In 11, Cl in
the 4-position forms Cl  Cl halogen
bonds with neighbouring LSAMs
whereas in 12, Cl in the 3-position
forms an intra-LSAM halogen bond.
Cocrystal 14 shows similarity with 12
in the organization along the long-
axis
dimension
because
the
Cl-
substituent positioning in 6 is similar
to 4. Curiously, this structure shows
an unusually large excess electron
density in the Fourier map in the 4-
position of the aniline. This excess
density may arise from a small
number of domains of pure 3,4,5-
trichlorophenol which have an O—
H  O tetramer in its native struc-
ture. The implication is that tetra-
mers of pure 1 and of the aniline–
phenol adduct (II) are present in
solution and that a small amount of
the
former
is
included
in
the
cocrystal in a solid solution manner.
Cocrystal 15 contains an aniline
analogue, 7, which is also substituted
with Cl in 3- and 4-positions. The Cl
in the 3-position shows partial occu-
pancy and, therefore, 7 behaves like
a 3,4,5-trichloroaniline. This substi-
tution pattern favours antiparallel

stacking (Fig. 5). Therefore, in 15, there is stacking of both
phenol and aniline rings. Avery short Cl  Cl type I contact of
length 3.078 (1) A˚ is observed which connects two LSAMs.
3.2.3. LSAM organization: tuning with halogen bonds. The
structure of the octamer LSAM in cocrystal 11 indicates that
Cl in the 4-position in 3, which lies on the periphery of the
LSAM, controls the organization of the LSAMs in the direc-
tion of the long axis. In this context, it was assumed that
replacing Cl with Br or I may lead to better control in the long-
axis direction. Accordingly, cocrystals 16 and 17 were
prepared. When 1 is cocrystallized with 8, it gives 16 (Table 1).
The LSAM remains intact as reﬂected in the a- and b direc-
tions. The c direction (which is longer than the corresponding
length in 11) is controlled by a Br  Cl type II interaction
which is 3.489 (1) A˚
in length. With the success of the
hypothesis that the halogen bond can control the strength and
directionality in the long crystal axis direction, we tried to
cocrystallize 9 with 1 in the next step, resulting in cocrystal 17.
The replacement of Br with I results in a cocrystal with a
similar structure (Table 1). The c direction is determined by an
I  Cl interaction of 3.583 (1) A˚ in length. When 1 is crystal-
lized with 10 it results in 18, which has a longer c axis than 15
(Table 1). These results show that the increased control in
engineering the packing in the longer crystal axis direction
(mostly the c axis in our study) can be obtained by introducing
halogen bonds (Metrangolo et al., 2005) oriented in that
direction (Fig. 6). It is also shown that if insulating interac-
tions with variable strengths are incorporated in almost
perpendicular directions, it is possible to predict the crystal
structures. The notable point in these structures is that the
common structural part is not restricted to tetramer synthon
II. The larger octamer LSAM, which is obtained by   
stacking of two tetramers, is impressively repeated in as many
as seven cocrystal structures. This observation leads to the
possibility that LSAMs may also exist in solution.
3.2.4. Transferability of tetramer and LSAM. The octamer
LSAM remains intact even when phenol 2 is cocrystallized
with 3, 6 and 7 to produce 20, 21 and 22 (Fig. 7). The tetramer
II is translated to LSAMs with an inversion centre between
two molecules of 2 to facilitate the stacking. The increase in
the c-axis length in 21 compared with 20 (Table 1) results from
the symmetric arrangement of Cl atoms in 6, which gives rise
to an extra Cl  Cl type I contact, compatible with triclinic
inversion symmetry. It is important to note that the same
LSAM is found in cocrystals formed by phenols 1 and 2, as
manifested in the lengths of the two shorter cell axes in
cocrystals 20, 21 and 22 being practically the same as the
corresponding ones in cocrystals 11, 12 and 14–18.
Cocrystal 19, on the other hand, shows the presence of
tetramer II but the LSAM is not the same (Fig. 8). Instead of
phenol–phenol antiparallel stacking as in 20, 21 and 22, there
is phenol–aniline stacking between molecules of 2 and 4.
Although only four cocrystals of phenol 2 were studied, it
appears that there is more structural variability in these
structures compared with the seven
cocrystals formed by phenol 1.
Perhaps the more distant posi-
tioning of the —OH group and Cl
atoms in 1 leads to a certain
amount of insulation and conse-
quent predictability of the crystal
structures.
3.2.5.
Distorted
LSAMs.
The
LSAM is a ﬁnite entity and its size
and shape depends on the posi-
tioning of the functional groups.
When 1 is cocrystallized with 5 it
gives 13, which contains distorted
LSAMs (Fig. 9). The uneven posi-

16, 17 and 18. Two 3,4,5-trichlorophenol molecules are still
stacked with each other by    interactions, but unlike the
other structures, they are not stacked in an antiparallel
fashion. Therefore, the distorted LSAM in this structure may
be attributed to the uneven positioning of Cl atoms on the
aniline periphery, which facilitates the formation of C—
H  Cl hydrogen bonds. Perhaps this hints that hydrogen
bonding precedes stacking in solution.
3.2.6. Transferability of the tetramer synthon to other
cocrystals. The next objective of the study was to test the
applicability of the proposed design strategy: the transfer-
ability of the tetrameric synthons was checked in more
complex multi-functional non-halogenated cocrystals where
other hydrogen bonding is possible. In other words, what is the
robustness of synthon II in the presence of other strong
hydrogen bonds? The coformers used in these studies contain
functional groups like amides and acids which are able to form
strong hydrogen bonds. The observation of the tetrameric
synthon in these cocrystals would depend upon the relative
positions of the functional groups as they are not completely
insulated from each other. It is well known that functional
groups in 1- and 4- positions often interfere, especially if both
of them are quite strong and directional in nature. Keeping
this aspect of crystal design in mind, we chose 3-amino-
benzamide for crystallization with 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and
3-aminobenzoic acid. When 3-aminobenzamide was cocrys-
tallized with 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, it resulted in the forma-
tion of a 1:1 cocrystal (23) which shows the presence of a
tetramer synthon (Fig. 10). The cocrystallization of 3-amino-

benzamide with 3-aminobenzoic acid gives cocrystal 24 which
also sustains tetramer II (Fig. 10).
When 4-aminobenzamide is cocrystallized with 3,5-dihy-
droxybenzoic acid, it results in cocrystal 25, which is also
sustained by the aniline–phenol tetramer II (Fig. 11). The
interesting aspect in this structure is the presence of amide–
amide and acid–acid interactions. This is very rare in the sense
that when acid and amide are present in a cocrystal system
they usually tend to form acid–amide heterosynthons in lieu of
homosynthons (Allen et al., 1999). A CSD search performed
on the aromatic acid–aromatic amide multi-component crys-
tals gave 37 hits, among which 13 (35.1%) structures have
amide–amide dimers. A manual analysis of these 13 structures
revealed that there is no structure wherein the acid–acid dimer
is also present. This implies that aniline–phenol recognition is
so persistent that even the ‘normal’ behaviour of acid and
amide functionalities is modiﬁed. This observation also rein-
forces the strength and robustness of the tetramer synthon.
3.3. Synthon structure in solution
The understanding of crystal nucleation and growth is still
at a nascent stage (Davey et al., 2013; Erdemir et al., 2009;
Weissbuch et al., 2003; Derdour & Skliar, 2012; Vekilov, 2010).
The region of the crystallization reaction coordinate (struc-
tural landscape) between the late stages of nucleation and the
early stages of growth is still far from understood (Desiraju,
2007). In this context, it is of interest to know whether
synthons that have been identiﬁed in crystals may actually be
deﬁned in solution. There are very few studies available to this
end. An FTIR study by Davey and co-workers of tetrolic acid
shows the presence of dimer and catemer synthons in solution
(Parveen et al., 2005). In a more recent study, ter Horst and co-
workers
performed
an
FTIR
and

study
on
isonicotinamide to probe the formation of homo- and
heterosynthons in solution (Kulkarni et al., 2012). Both of
these studies indicate that there is a possibility of carry-over of
the small synthons from solution to the crystal if classical
nucleation theory operates. However, these studies are silent
about larger synthons and LSAMs. In the present study, the
robustness of the tetramer synthon II and corresponding
octamer LSAM prompted us to look at the aggregation
behaviour in solution, through the following NMR studies.

as

of
concentration. Fig. 12 shows one-dimensional
1H NMR
spectra of 14 in CDCl3 at various dilutions. A single set of
resonances that can be assigned to the aniline and phenol
fragments is observed. This indicates that in solution the
sample is homogeneous and that the fragments do not exhibit
conformational exchange. A downﬁeld shift of the 2, 6 protons
(  6.8 p.p.m.) of 1 as a function of dilution (A!E) is clearly
observed, indicating stacking of the aromatic rings. The abrupt
shift in going from E to F shows that aromatic stacking
interactions are lost at this point. The aromatic protons of
aniline (  6.55 and  6.74 p.p.m.) are largely unaffected
upon dilution. Noting that the phenol rings are stacked in the
crystal structure of 14, the downﬁeld shift of the phenol
protons may arise from the presence of the octamer species in
solution, or it may arise from a simple stacking of isolated
phenol molecules. To distinguish between these possibilities,
samples A, E and F were studied to estimate association and
comparative molecular sizes using NOEs, measurement of T1
relaxation rates and translational diffusion coefﬁcients.

2000) study of 14, to examine the possibility of aniline–phenol
hydrogen bonding in solution, and in turn the presence of
tetramer II. Saturation of the H2, H6 protons of 6 and the
resulting NOE on the proximal H2, H6 protons of 1 (Fig. 13a)
conﬁrms hydrogen bonding between —NH2 and —OH
groups. The peaks at  6.7 and 6.9 p.p.m. are the NOE
difference peaks of the H2, H6 protons of 1. The presence of
these peaks at all three dilutions indicate that the hydrogen
bonding between 1 and 6 is intact in solution. Based on the
robustness of tetramer synthon II in the crystal structures in
this study, the CSD results on earlier aniline–phenol cocrys-
tals, and the CSP results given by Dey et al. (2005), we
conclude that the hydrogen bonding is prevalent in a cyclic
closed tetramer, II, in solution (Fig. 13b). Finally these data,
when taken in conjunction with the chemical shift data
discussed above, would indicate that the stacking interactions
responsible for the formation of the LSAM is preceded by the
hydrogen-bonded association of 1 and 6 to form the tetramer
synthon.
3.3.3. Longitudinal relaxation time constants (T1). 13C T1
relaxation time constants (Table 2) were measured using the
T1 inversion recovery pulsed method (Claridge, 2008). In
general, for solutes in non-viscous solvents, the T1 relaxation
time constant increases as the molecular size decreases. This is
due to a decrease in the rotational correlation time. From the
values in Table 2, it is clear that T1 increases from A!E!F,
in other words with increasing dilution; this is strongly
suggestive of dissociation from octamer to tetramer species.
3.3.4. Estimation of translational diffusion coefficients
(Ds). To differentiate the sizes of various molecular aggregates
in solution, the translational diffusion coefﬁcients of mole-
cular species in solutions A, E and F were measured using the
bipolar pulsed gradient stimulated echo sequence (Stejskal &
Tanner, 1965; Johnson, 1999). Fig. S4 in the supporting infor-
mation is an example of the one-dimensional diffusion NMR
spectra obtained at 600 MHz. Fig. S5 shows the two-dimen-
sional representation of the experimentally derived transla-
tional diffusion coefﬁcients. Since the translational diffusion
coefﬁcient is inversely proportional to the radius of the
molecule that is diffusing, a decrease in radius should result in
an increase in Ds. This is exactly what is observed in going
from A!E!F (Table 3).
3.3.5. 1,2,3-Trichlorobenzene: a control compound to
identify stacking in the LSAM. 1,2,3-Trichlorobenzene, 26, was
chosen as a test compound to probe changes in chemical shifts
that can arise from the stacking of the 1,2,3-trichlorophenyl
rings. In the crystal, 26 exists as a two-molecule antiparallel
stack (see supporting information) (Hazell et al., 1972). It was
anticipated that this antiparallel stack would persist in solution

but obviously there would be no hydrogen bonding as seen in
cocrystal 14. The effect of concentration on this stacking
interaction was studied in a manner similar to that for 14. Fig.
14 shows one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra of 26 at different
dilutions. The molar concentration of 26 in each sample was
identical to that of 1 and 6 in each of the corresponding
samples (A!F) of 14. The abrupt change in chemical shift in
going from E!F once again indicates that the stacking
interaction in lost upon dilution, at a deﬁnite point. The
translational diffusion coefﬁcients measured for 26 (Table 4)
indicate no change at dilutions A1 and E1 and a small change
in F1, in accordance with the above interpretation.
The measured values of T1 and Ds for 26 in samples A1, E1
and F1 are given in Table 4. The two-dimensional DOSY plots
for A1, E1 and F1 are shown in the supporting information
(xS4). The larger values of T1 in the case of 26 strongly suggest
that the aggregates in A1 and E1 are smaller than the corre-
sponding aggregates in A and E of 14, as would be expected.
The size of the dimer of 26 is roughly four times smaller than
the octamer LSAM derived from 14. Additional evidence for
this interpretation comes from the values of the measured
translational diffusion coefﬁcients. From the values given in
Table 4, it is clear that the species in A1 and E1 are signiﬁcantly
smaller in size than those in A and E, although it is not
possible to state that it is exactly four times smaller. As
mentioned above, crystallographic studies have established
that 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene forms a stacked antiparallel dimer
in the solid state. Thus, it may be concluded that A1 and E1
represent the stacked antiparallel dimers of 1,2,3-trichloro-
benzene, and F1 the monomer form. In summary, the solution
NMR studies indicate that in the phenol–aniline system
investigated here, the LSAMs are assembled via stacking
interactions of tetramer synthons. The sequence of events is
therefore established: hydrogen bonding between aniline and
phenol comes ﬁrst and    stacking follows.
One-dimensional
15N spectra (supporting information)
recorded on samples A, E and F show no change in the
chemical shift positions as a function of concentration. Since
15N chemical shifts are very sensitive to the environment, this
observation reinforces the conclusion that hydrogen bonding
persists in F. The absence of other peaks in the 15N spectrum of
F further points towards the presence of a single species within
the limits of detection.
3.3.6. Presence of a hydrogen-bonded tetramer in solution.
The NMR experiments point to a hydrogen-bonded and
stacked aggregate at higher concentrations that loses the
stacking interactions upon dilution to give a hydrogen-bonded
aggregate. This indicates that hydrogen bonding in this system
is stronger than stacking. We have interpreted these results in
terms of a hydrogen-bonded tetramer which is stacked to form
dimers, trimers and in the limit of high concentrations n-mers
of tetramers. It is desirable to rule out a trivial scenario in
which the highest concentration species is a stacked structure
of hydrogen-bonded dimers. The evidence for this is as
follows: T1 values in A through to E indicate that the species
size is gradually decreasing. This is corroborated by the
diffusion coefﬁcients and is in accord with a stacked n-mer in
A reducing to a stacked dimer in E. It is highly unlikely that
the stacked n-mers are constituted with hydrogen-bonded
dimers or even trimers because hydrogen bonding is a
stronger interaction than stacking. The tetramer structure,
which
is
‘saturated’
with
respect
to
hydrogen-bonded
capability, is a far more likely candidate to be the basic
synthon in the structure. Circumstantial evidence for this is
also provided by the distorted LSAM in 13, which is a high-Z 0
crystal structure where stacking is distorted but where the
hydrogen-bonded tetramer is preserved fully.
4. Conclusions
The rational synthesis of cocrystals is a difﬁcult task. It
becomes even more difﬁcult when there are multiple synthon
possibilities in the system and one tries to design a cocrystal
wherein the desired synthon is not the most probable one. In
this study, a number of aniline–phenol cocrystals have been
isolated and shown to contain a large but robust octamer
synthon, or LSAM, stabilized by cooperative N—H  O—
H   hydrogen bonding and    stacking, and where the
hydrogen bonding deﬁnes a closed tetramer. It is noteworthy
that a synthon this large and complex is repeated in so many
crystal structures. NMR experiments in solution demonstrate
conclusively the presence of hydrogen bonding and stacking
interactions in solution, the likely presence of a tetramer and
octamer and the preferred aggregation via hydrogen bonding
as compared with stacking. The NMR studies are a way of
establishing the hierarchy in which the various intermolecular

interactions are established in the molecular association
process. This could be a reason why the tetramers are trans-
ferrable even to cocrystals that are dominated by strong
hydrogen bonds (23, 24, 25). To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst
time that such stepwise formation of intermolecular interac-
tions has been monitored. The LSAM is, in a true sense, an
additive representation of supramolecular synthons because
the geometrical and chemical information implied in supra-
molecular synthons add up to make a LSAM, which is
signiﬁcant in the very late stages of nucleation. Therefore, it is
reasonable to assume that LSAMs can be more useful than
individual supramolecular synthons in crystal design, espe-
cially when the ﬁner details like unit-cell dimensions are sought
to be engineered. The observation of a LSAM in solution and
its use in crystal engineering in a predictable way may there-
fore pave the way for control of crystal packing with greater
predictability and precision.
