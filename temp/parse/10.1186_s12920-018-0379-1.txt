Abstract
Background: Cellular changes described in human gastroparesis have revealed a role for immune dysregulation,
however, a mechanistic understanding of human gastroparesis and the signaling pathways involved are still unclear.
Methods: Diabetic gastroparetics, diabetic non-gastroparetic controls, idiopathic gastroparetics and non-diabetic
non-gastroparetic controls underwent full-thickness gastric body biopsies. Deep RNA sequencing was performed
and pathway analysis of differentially expressed transcripts was done using Ingenuity®. A subset of differentially
expressed genes in diabetic gastroparesis was validated in a separate cohort using QT-PCR.
Results: 111 genes were differentially expressed in diabetic gastroparesis and 181 in idiopathic gastroparesis with
a log2fold difference of | ≥2| and false detection rate (FDR) < 5%. Top canonical pathways in diabetic gastroparesis
included genes involved with macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis
pathway and differential regulation of cytokine production in macrophages and T helper cells by IL-17A and IL-17F.
Top canonical pathways in idiopathic gastroparesis included genes involved in granulocyte adhesion and diapedesis,
agranulocyte adhesion and diapedesis, and role of macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in rheumatoid
arthritis. Sixty-five differentially expressed genes (log2fold difference | ≥2|, FDR < 5%) were common in both diabetic
and idiopathic gastroparesis with genes in the top 5 canonical pathways associated with immune signaling. 4/5
highly differentially expressed genes (SGK1, APOLD1, CXCR4, CXCL2, and FOS) in diabetic gastroparesis were
validated in a separate cohort of patients using RT-PCR. Immune profile analysis revealed that genes associated
with M1 (pro inflammatory) macrophages were enriched in tissues from idiopathic gastroparesis tissues compared to
controls (p < 0.05).
Conclusions: Diabetic and idiopathic gastroparesis have both unique and overlapping transcriptomic signatures.
Innate immune signaling likely plays a central role in pathogenesis of human gastroparesis.

Background
Diabetic and idiopathic gastroparesis result in significant
morbidity and health-care utilization [1]. There is an un-
met need for safe and efficacious treatment options [2].
Our mechanistic understanding of gastroparesis has ex-
panded in the last decade; however, actionable therapeutic
targets are still missing. We and others have shown that
loss of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) is a primary cellular
injury in animal models and in patients with gastroparesis
[3, 4]. In diabetic gastroparesis, this decrease in ICC
number correlates with the degree of gastric retention
[5]. Ultrastructural studies have allowed us to examine
defects in ICC and the broader neuromuscular apparatus
[6]. Diabetic gastroparetics had thickened basal lamina
around smooth muscles and nerves, whereas, idiopathic
gastroparetics had fibrosis, especially around the nerves. This
suggests possibility of both overlapping and unique mechan-
istic aspects for diabetic and idiopathic gastroparesis.
Recent animal studies have provided a paradigm for
immune mediated injury of the enteric neuromuscular
apparatus, including ICC, to be central in pathogenesis
of gastroparesis. In the non-obese diabetic (NOD)
mouse model, the proportion of CD206, heme oxygenase-1
(HO1) –positive “M2” macrophages (alternatively activated
or anti-inflammatory) increased with development of dia-
betes. However, the development of delayed gastric empty-
ing was associated with an increase in iNOS expression, a
marker for macrophages with a “M1” phenotype (classically
activated or pro-inflammatory) [7]. Macrophage-deficient
CSF1op/op mice did not develop delayed gastric emptying
despite severe diabetes [8]. Decreased CD206+ (M2 macro-
phages) have also been reported in the gastric antrum of
patients with diabetic and idiopathic gastroparesis which
correlated with the loss of ICC [9]. Additionally, HO1
expressed in M2 macrophages is directly associated
with delayed gastric emptying in diabetic mice and poly-
morphisms in the HO1 gene (HMOX1) are associated with
worse outcomes in human diseases [7].
Despite the advances and insights gained from animal
models and human studies, our mechanistic understanding
of physiological and clinical changes in human gastropar-
esis is still limited. The NIDDK Gastroparesis Clinical Re-
search Consortium (GpCRC) collects full thickness gastric
tissue from patients with diabetic and idiopathic gastropar-
esis. We undertook a hypothesis generating approach to at-
tempt to obtain molecular and cellular targets for future
mechanistic and therapeutic studies. Our aim was to
determine the abundance and relationships between gene
transcripts in diabetic and idiopathic gastroparesis by deep
sequencing of RNA extracted from the smooth muscle
layers including the myenteric plexus of the human gastric
body. Secondly, we aimed to identify transcription-
based signaling pathways in diabetic and idiopathic
gastroparesis.
Methods
Specimens
Full thickness gastric body biopsies were obtained from
7 diabetic gastroparetics, 7 diabetic non-gastroparetic
controls, 5 idiopathic gastroparetics and 7 non-diabetic
non-gastroparetic controls. Differences between female
and male transcriptome are expected and the prevalence
of gastroparesis is higher in females. Hence, in this pilot
study, only female transcriptome was determined to allow
sufficient power for analysis for one sex. The gastroparesis
patients were undergoing implantation of a gastric elec-
trical stimulator at the time of tissue procurement, and
the controls were undergoing obesity surgery. 37% of
gastroparetic patients were obese (BMI > 30 kg/m2). All
patients were > 18 years of age with symptoms of at
least 12-weeks duration, delayed gastric emptying on
scintigraphy (> 60% retention at 2 h or > 10% retention
at 4 h), and no evidence of gastric outlet obstruction.
Exclusion criteria included presence of active inflammatory
bowel disease, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, neurological
conditions, acute liver or renal failure, and history of total
or subtotal gastric resection. Tissue collection was done in
standardized fashion from the gastric body with established
protocols by the participating sites of the GpCRC. As a
part of this, the surgeon is required to follow an exact
protocol for procuring tissue from a precisely defined loca-
tion and mark the position on a working sheet. Following
this, a member of the research team ensures that the biop-
sies are promptly preserved in appropriate solutions. The
pathology core at Mayo Clinic prepares and ships fixative
solutions to all sites. The tissue is shipped as overnight pri-
ority to Mayo Clinic and is subsequently processed using
standardized procedures. The mucosa was peeled and the
muscularis sample was cryopreserved in RNAlater until
further use. All gastroparesis patients provided written in-
formed consent for procurement and use of gastric tissue
at the clinical sites of GpCRC. All clinical sites of GpCRC
had approval from their institutional IRBs. All control
tissues were obtained in a de-identified fashion at Mayo
Clinic in an IRB-approved protocol. Oral consent was
obtained for use of this tissue.
RNA extraction
Total RNA was isolated from the smooth muscle using
RNA-Bee (TelTest, Friendswood, TX) and purified for
sequencing using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Valencia CA). Samples were tested by the Mayo Gene
Expression Core using the Agilent Bioanalyzer and all
had a RNA Integrity Numbers (RIN) > 7.0.
RNA sequencing
Samples were sequenced using the Illumina TruSeq v2
library prep kit with 3 samples in each lane using a
paired end index read with 51 base reads. RNA-Seq data

were analyzed by the Mayo Clinic Division of Biomedical
Statistics and Informatics using a comprehensive bio-
informatics pipeline, defined MAP-RSeq (version 2.1.1),
a streamlined pipeline for processing paired-end RNA
sequencing reads with low intervention during the ana-
lysis stage [10]. The MAP-RSeq utilized a variety of
freely available bioinformatics tools along with in-house
developed methods to align, assess and provide multiple
genomic features from transcriptomic sequencing data
for further downstream analysis.
Differential expression analysis
The data were subjected to principal component analysis
(PCA) using the Partek Suite to establish whether the
samples in each group had differing expression profiles.
Differentially expressed genes were determined using the
edgeR package [11]. The criterion for considering a gene
transcript to be differentially expressed was having an
adjusted probability of significance (adjusted P) less than
0.05 (or false discovery rate, FDR < 5%). Separately, tran-
scripts with a log2 fold difference of 2 and higher or −2
and lower (log2FC |2|) were used for creating heat maps
and for pathway analysis. We used R packages, edgeR
[11] and RNASeqPower [12] to obtain coefficient of
variation and perform statistical power analysis. In our
cohort, 90% of the expressed genes have a coefficient of
variation less than 0.42. Using the formula from RNA-
SeqPower, setting the type I error to 0.05 and the power
to 80%, 13 samples per group would be needed to ob-
serve a 2-fold expression in a gene. Seven subjects per
group provide 51% power to detect a 2-fold expression
in a gene.
Pathway analysis
Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) was used to determine
pathways and other associations connecting the differen-
tially expressed transcripts [13].
Immune profile analysis
To determine the immune cell composition of the gastro-
paresis and control RNA samples, normalized gene counts
(reads per kilobase per million mapped reads, RPKM)
generated from MAP-RSeq were subset to the LM22 sig-
nature gene set from CIBERSORT [14]. The probability
values reported by CIBERSORT for M1 and M2 macro-
phages were assessed for differences between the diabetic
and idiopathic gastroparesis groups compared to their
controls using a 2-sided non-parametric unpaired t-test. A
p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RT-PCR for validation
Transcripts that are altered in both diabetic and idio-
pathic gastroparesis were determined. Subsequently, genes
with putative biological significance for gastroparesis were
identified and their expression was determined in a separ-
ate validation cohort of full thickness gastric body tissue
from 6 diabetic gastroparesis subjects and 6 diabetic con-
trols using RT PCR. β-actin was used as the housekeeping
gene and delta Ct values were calculated. The following
genes were sequenced: SGK, serum/glucocorticoid reg-
ulated kinase 1; APOLD1, apolipoprotein L domain
containing 1; CXCR4, C-X-C motif chemokine receptor
4; CXCL2, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 2; and FOS,
Fos proto-oncogene.
Results
Patient characteristics
Table 1 highlights the demographic and disease character-
istics of diabetic gastroparetics, diabetic non-gastroparetic
controls, idiopathic gastroparetics and non-diabetic non-
gastroparetic controls. The median age was similar among
the 4 groups. The overall gastroparesis cardinal symptom
index (GCSI) score and the subtype scores (nausea,
fullness and bloating) were similar between diabetic and
idiopathic gastroparetics.
Sequencing depth
RNA samples had a minimum RIN value of 7.4 and at
least 80 million reads were obtained from each sample
(Additional file 1: Table S1). At least 60,000,000 reads
mapped to 64,253 identified gene transcripts. The gene
annotation used was from Ensembl release 78. The tran-
script identifiers were obtained from the gene definition
file for Homo sapiens GRCh38.78, obtained from the
Ensembl ftp server (ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-78/
gtf/homo_sapiens/). Samples were enriched for markers
of smooth muscle (ACTG2, ACTB, ACTA2), neurons
(UCHL1), glia (S100B) and, to a lesser extent, ICC (Kit,
Ano1) indicating that the tissue was enriched for cells
from the muscularis propria of the gastric wall. Minimal
contamination with RNA derived from the mucosa was
detected as indicated by low numbers of reads for genes
enriched in the mucosal layers of the GI including trefoil
factors (TFF1 and TFF2), gastric lipase (LIPF), gastric
intrinsic factor (GIF) and pepsinogens (PGA3 and PGA5).
The dataset has been submitted to Gene Expression
Omnibus (GSE115601).
Differentially expressed genes in diabetic gastroparesis
Three hundred and seventy-three gene transcripts
were differentially expressed (FDR < 5%) among dia-
betic gastroparetics and diabetic non-gastroparetic con-
trols (Additional file 2: Table S2). 104 of the 373 were
upregulated and the remaining genes were downregulated
in diabetic gastroparesis. Expression levels in RPKM for
one hundred and eleven genes with a log2fold differ-
ence in expression of | ≥2| as compared to diabetic
controls are shown in the heatmap (Fig. 1a). When

diabetic gastroparetics were compared with non-diabetic con-
trols, 568 genes were differentially expressed (Additional file 3:
Table S3); 130 of those had a log2fold difference in ex-
pression of | ≥2|.
Genes with log2fold difference in expression of | ≥2|
(n = 111) were analyzed using the Ingenuity pathway
analysis. The 3 top canonical pathways were associated
with role of macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells
in rheumatoid arthritis (p-value 1.12E-07), osteoarthritis
pathway (p-value 3.63E-07) and differential regulation of
cytokine production in macrophages and T helper cells by
IL-17A and IL-17F (p-value 9.74E-07). However, only 3–
22% differentially expressed genes in our dataset over-
lapped with the total genes known to be associated with
these pathways in the Ingenuity database. Four genes that
were common to at least 2/3 top canonical pathways were
CCL2, IL6, IL1RL1 and ADAMTS4, all downregulated in
diabetic gastroparesis. Hematological system development
and function was the leading physiological function
identified linked by 49 of the 130 molecules with quantity
of leucocytes as the key annotated function associated
with 34 of those molecules (Increased ALOX15 and
RORC; Decreased ATF3, CCL2, CCL4, CD69, CDKN1A,
CLEC4E, CSF3, CXCL2, CXCR2, CXCR4, DUSP1,
DUSP5, EGR1, F3, FOS, FOSB, FPR1, GADD45B,
GADD45G, IL1RL1, IL6, IL17R, KLF4, MYC, OSM,
RGS1, S100A8, S100A9, SERPINE1, SOCS3, THBS1,
and ZFP36). The top biological gene interaction contain-
ing the most number of differentially expressed genes in
our group was “inflammatory disease, cellular movement,
hematological system development and function”.
Differentially expressed genes in idiopathic gastroparesis
Seven hundred and twenty-seven gene transcripts were
differentially expressed between idiopathic gastroparetics
and non-diabetic non-gastropareticcontrols (Additionalfile4:
Table S4). Of those, 73 genes were upregulated in idiopathic
gastroparesis and the remaining genes were downregulated.
Expression levels in RPKM are shown for one hundred
eighty-one genes with at least a | ≥2| log2fold difference in
expression as compared to controls are shown in the
heatmap (Fig. 1b).
Genes with log2fold difference (n = 181) in expression
of | ≥2| were analyzed using the Ingenuity pathway ana-
lysis. This revealed the 3 top canonical pathways with
genes associated with granulocyte adhesion and diape-
desis (p-value 3.49E-20), agranulocyte adhesion and
diapedesis (p-value 2.68E-13), and role of macrophages,
fibroblasts and endothelial cells in rheumatoid arthritis
(p-value 4.74E-12). All of these genes were downregulated
in idiopathic gastroparesis. Five genes that were common
to all three top canonical pathways were C5AR1, CCL2,
CXCL8, IL1B and SELE. There was 6–12% overlap in
genes associated with these functions in these top path-
ways and the differentially expressed genes in the Ingenu-
ity dataset. A fourth canonical pathway contained 7 of the
18 genes (CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CSF3, IL6, IL10 and IL1B)
that have been associated with differential regulation of
cytokine production in macrophages and T helper cells by
IL-17A and IL-17F. Immune cell trafficking was the
leading physiological function identified linked by 82 of
the 181 molecules with leucocyte migration as the key
annotated function associated with 71 of those molecules.
The top biological gene interaction network containing
the most number of differentially expressed genes in
our group was “cellular movement, immune cell traffick-
ing, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction”.
Differentially expressed genes common to diabetic and
idiopathic gastroparesis
Two hundred genes were differentially expressed in both
diabetic and idiopathic gastroparesis as compared to their
controls (Additional file 5: Table S5). Distribution of
common and overlapping genes between the two com-
parison groups with a log2fold difference of | ≥2| is
shown in Fig. 2a. Sixty five genes were common to both
groups and all of them were downregulated in gastropar-
esis (Fig. 2b). The top 3 canonical pathways had genes as-
sociated with granulocyte adhesion and diapedesis (CCL2,
CCL4, CSF3, CXCL2, CXCR2, CXCR4, FPR1, and IL1R1,

and differential regulation of cytokine production in macro-
phages and T helper cells by IL-17A and IL-17F (CCL2,
CCL4, CSF3 and IL6, p = 1.15E-07) (Fig. 2c). The differential
regulation of cytokine production in macrophages and T
helper cells by IL-17A and IL-17F had 4 genes overlapping
with 18 associated with that pathway (22% overlap).
Hematological system development and function (41 genes)
and tissue morphology (38 genes) were the two top physio-
logical systems affected with the function “quantity of leu-
cocytes” linking most differentially expressed genes.
RT-PCR validation of common genes
Five highly differentially expressed genes in diabetic
gastroparesis were selected for validation studies (SGK1,
serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1; APOLD1, apoli-
poprotein L domain containing 1; CXCR4, C-X-C motif
chemokine receptor 4; CXCL2, C-X-C motif chemokine
ligand 2; and FOS, Fos proto-oncogene). Four of these
were significantly downregulated in diabetic gastroparesis
(APOLD1, CXCR4, CXCL2, and FOS) as observed in the
RNA seq analysis (Fig. 3). The one gene that was not
found to be statistically different on RT-PCR had signifi-
cant but lower log2fold changes in expression on RNA
seq (SGK1–1.77). The most robust differences were

seen in APOLD1, apolipoprotein L domain containing
1 (ΔΔCT = 3.595, P < 0.0001) and FOS, Fos proto-oncogene
(ΔΔCT = 3.588, P < 0.0001).
Immune profile analysis
The CIBERSORT immune cell analysis revealed no sig-
nificant differences in enrichment of M1 or M2 macro-
phage associated genes in the diabetic gastroparesis and
diabetic control samples. However, M1 (pro-inflammatory)
macrophage associated genes were significantly more
highly represented in idiopathic gastroparetic samples
than in non-diabetic, non-gastroparetic controls (Mean
(SD): 0.04 (0.03) % vs 0.004 (0.007) % M1 associated
genes in idiopathic gastroparesis and idiopathic controls
respectively, p = 0.02). The quantification for percentage
of genes associated with these macrophage subtypes in
diabetic and idiopathic gastroparesis vs their controls are
displayed in Fig. 4.
Discussion
Recent advancements made in molecular understanding
of gastroparesis using animal models and human samples
have elucidated an important role of the innate immune
system [15]. This is likely driven by a shift in polarization
of macrophages and associated expression of pro- and
anti-inflammatory cytokines. The current proposed cen-
tral mechanism for gastroparesis includes macrophage
driven loss of or functional abnormalities in ICC and
other components of the enteric neuromuscular apparatus
which can then affect gastric motility.
This study utilizing deep transcriptional sequencing of
the human stomach neuromuscular apparatus further pro-
vides evidence for innate immune dysregulation as the key
feature of both diabetic and idiopathic gastroparesis. More
specifically, it highlights that macrophage function and sig-
naling is associated with this disease process. Additionally,
this study identifies pathways that are potentially unique to
diabetic and idiopathic gastroparesis. Macrophage and T

helper cell signaling genes were differentially expressed in
diabetic gastroparesis, whereas, granulocyte and agranulo-
cyte function genes were associated with pathways involved
in idiopathic gastroparesis.
This study builds upon findings from mouse models
and in vitro studies. In the NOD mouse model of gastro-
paresis, animals that retain normal gastric emptying have
normal ICC networks and CD206-positive, HO1-positive
M2 macrophages (anti-inflammatory spectrum) in the
muscularis propria, while animals developing delayed gas-
tric emptying demonstrated damage in ICC networks and
express CD206-negative and HO1-negative M1 macro-
phages (pro-inflammatory spectrum) [7]. Furthermore, the
presence of macrophages was found to be essential for de-
velopment of delayed gastric emptying [8]. Our in vitro
work has also provided evidence for M1 macrophage gen-
erated TNF-α to be involved in caspase-mediated apoptosis
and Kit down regulation in ICC [16]. Finally, human studies
have shown a positive correlation between the number of
ICC and M2 macrophages in diabetics and diabetic gastro-
paresis [17]. The loss of ICC has been correlated with im-
pairment in gastric emptying [5].

A large number of transcripts were found to be signifi-
cantly altered in both diabetic and idiopathic gastropar-
esis patients compared to their controls. Four transcripts
common to top canonical pathways in diabetic gastro-
paresis include CCL2 (C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 2),
a monocyte chemoattractant protein coding gene; IL6,
pro-inflammatory gene involved in differentiation of
B-cells, monocyte and generation of Th17 cells and also
involved in improving insulin resistance and susceptibil-
ity to diabetes mellitus; IL1RL1 (Interleukin 1 Receptor
Like 1), a receptor involved in proinflammatory stimuli
and function of T helper cells; and ADAMTS4 (ADAM
Metallopeptidase with Thrombospondin Type 1 Motif 4), a
protease involved in degradation of cartilage protein aggre-
can and extracellular matrix protein brevican. All of these
transcripts were downregulated in diabetic gastroparesis.
In idiopathic gastroparesis, five transcripts common to all
three top canonical pathways include C5AR1 (Comple-
ment C5a Receptor 1), receptor for inflammatory peptide
C5a involved in both innate and adaptive immune re-
sponse; CCL2 (C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 2); CXCL8
(C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 8) chemotactic factor for
neutrophils, basophils, and T-cells; IL1B (Interleukin 1
Beta), a macrophage produced cytokine involved in acute
B and T cell activation and cyclooxygenase 2 activation;
and SELE (Selectin E), a leucocyte cell surface adhesion
protein. All of these transcripts were downregulated in gas-
troparesis. It remains to be further investigated whether
these changes have an influence on the protein expression
and it should be kept in mind that the majority of differen-
tially expressed genes in our dataset did not overlap with
the total genes known to be associated with these pathways
in the Ingenuity database suggesting that the specific path-
ways involved may be different. When transcripts common
to diabetic and idiopathic gastroparesis were analyzed,
five transcripts associated with IL-17A signaling (CCL2,
CEBPD, FOS, IL6 and JUN) were found to be involved.
IL-17A is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that regulates
NF-kappa B and mitogen-activated protein kinases and
can stimulate expression of IL6 and COX-2 [18, 19]. It
has been shown to stimulate inflammatory activity in
human subepithelial myofibroblasts [20] and involved in
and production of nitric oxide in endothelial cells [21].
Of interest is the significant overlap of genes between
diabetic and idiopathic gastroparesis that was found in
this study. There currently is a healthy and vigorous debate
on whether idiopathic gastroparesis belongs more to the
functional bowel disorder spectrum of diseases or more to
the diabetic gastroparesis spectrum. The findings of this
study suggest similarities in pathophysiology between dia-
betic and idiopathic gastroparesis and presents mechanistic
insight into idiopathic gastroparesis as a non-functional
disease. Interestingly, almost twice the numbers of tran-
scripts were altered in idiopathic gastroparesis compared
to diabetic gastroparesis when compared with their
controls.
The CIBERSORT analysis provided a complementary
approach at determining associations between abundance
of specific cell type associated genes in specific subjects
within the disease groups. This showed a higher abundance
of genes indicating presence of M1 (pro-inflammatory
spectrum) macrophages in the idiopathic gastroparesis
tissues when compared to their controls. This is inter-
esting since in in vitro studies, M1 macrophage derived
TNFα was found to cause loss of ICC through reduced
Kit expression [16].
Significant challenges exist in the studies of human
macrophages due to diversity of macrophage phenotypes
and considerable differences between markers for mouse
and human macrophages. In mice, mucosal monocytes
with lymphocyte antigen 6C (Ly6C) expression differentiate
into pro-inflammatory (M1) and inflammatory dendritic
cells upon entering the tissue [22]. However, in humans
Gr1+, an equivalent of mouse Ly6C is not associated with
expression of proinflammatory markers [23]. In lung
tissue, TGM2 was found to be a robust marker for the
anti-inflammatory macrophage subtype; however, this
has not been validated in gastrointestinal tissues [24].
The marker used to study macrophage subtypes depend
upon disease, species and sites involved. In general, the
dichotomous differentiation of M1 and M2 phenotype
is currently discouraged and these phenotypes should
be seen in a spectrum. iNOS is expressed robustly in
mouse macrophages in inflammation but is repressed
epigenetically in human macrophages [25]. Arginase-1 and
Ym1 are examples of other proteins that are expressed in
mouse but not human M2 macrophages [26]. There-
fore, classification of human macrophages continues to
be a work in progress. In both mice and human, muscu-
laris macrophages have been identified in close proximity
to ICC suggesting a role in their function [27]. A variety of
neurotransmitter receptors on macrophages regulate their
functional phenotype. Additionally, neurons express recep-
tors for macrophage-derived signaling molecules that alter
neuronal activity and survival including bone morphogenetic
protein 2 [28] and TNFα [29]. Nitric oxide produced by
iNOS in mouse (but not human) macrophages suppresses
neuronal [30] and smooth muscle excitability [31]. A recent
study of idiopathic gastroparetics revealed decreased
expression of PDGFRα and its ligands PDGFA and PDGFB,
smooth muscle proteins (MYH11, MYLK1, and PAK1),
non-specific macrophage marker (CD68), gene encoding
HO1 (HMOX1) and immunosuppressive cytokine TGFβ1
[32]. Functional interactions between macrophages and
ICC and other components of neuromuscular apparatus
in humans need to be studied.
A limitation of the study is the small sample size.
Seven subjects per group provide 51% power to detect a

2-fold expression in a gene, indicating that certain import-
ant genes may have been missed. These findings will re-
quire validation in a larger cohort of gastroparesis patients.
This will also be necessary to determine if there are subsets
within gastroparesis with distinct transcriptional profiles
based on symptoms, gastric emptying delay or overlap with
other diagnoses. Secondly, all controls were obese, whereas,
only 37% of gastroparesis patients were obese. Since obesity
is also a proinflammatory state, this could have confounded
the results of the analysis. However, in our previous study
no differences in global immune cell population (CD45
immunoreactive cells) were seen between obese and
non-obese subjects [3]. Third, the databases used for
Ingenuity pathway analysis are enriched in transcripts
associated with immune and cancer biology. This may
skew pathways analyses towards those biological func-
tions. Another observation from the current study is lack
of evidence of pathways linking transcripts for neuromus-
cular function which synchronizes with our findings at
protein level, where nerve and neuronal changes were
seen in only a subset of patients with gastroparesis. Al-
though, this may be due to limitations of the Ingenuity
platform, another possibility includes that cumulative
transcriptional expression in a complex biological sample
containing multiple cell types may mask changes seen in
gene expression in specific cell-types.
Conclusions
This study is the first to determine whole transcriptomic
changes in deeper neuromuscular apparatus in gastroparesis
(or any gastrointestinal motility disorder). Several important
observations are made. First, diabetic and idiopathic gastro-
paresis have both unique and overlapping changes in the
transcriptome. However, immune signaling predomi-
nates the pathways linking most of the differentially
expressed transcripts. Second, most patients with idiopathic
gastroparesis differentially expressed transcripts compared
to controls that have been associated with pro-inflammatory
(M1) macrophage phenotype. Third, transcriptomics pro-
vides reliable targets for future mechanistic work consider-
ing the validation of selected genes achieved in a separate
set of diabetic gastroparesis patients. These findings make a
case for targeting innate immune system for development of
future treatment approaches to gastroparesis but the mo-
lecular targets identified will need further investigations in
animal models to determine the optimal timing of interven-
tion aimed at preventing or reversing damage to the gastric
function.
