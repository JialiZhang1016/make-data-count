A hydroxamate transfer reaction between metal complexes has been investigated by a combination of
experimental and theoretical studies. A hydroxamate-bound cobalt(II) complex bearing a tetradentate
macrocyclic
ligand,
[CoII(TBDAP)(CH3C(–NHO)O)]+
(1),
is
prepared
by
the
reduction
of
a hydroximatocobalt(III) complex with a biological reductant. Alternatively, 1 is accessible via a synthetic
route for the reaction between the cobalt(II) complex and acetohydroxamic acid in the presence of
a base. 1 was isolated and characterized by various physicochemical methods, including UV-vis, IR, ESI-
MS, and X-ray crystallography. The hydroxamate transfer reactivity of 1 was examined with a zinc
complex, which was followed by UV-vis and ESI-MS. Kinetic and activation parameter data suggest that
the hydroxamate transfer reaction occurs via a bimolecular mechanism, which is also supported by DFT
calculations.
Moreover,
1
is
able
to
inhibit
the
activity
against
a
zinc
enzyme,
i.e.,
matrix
metalloproteinase-9. Our overall investigations of the hydroxamate transfer using the synthetic model
system provide considerable insight into the ﬁnal step involved in the inhibition of zinc-containing enzymes.
Introduction
Hydroxamic acids are important pharmacophores in diverse
biological functions such as antimicrobial activity and metal
detoxication.1–5 The derivatives of hydroxamic acids are well
known as zinc-binding groups; thus, they can inhibit the activity
of zinc-containing enzymes, including carbonic anhydrase,
histone deacetylase and carboxypeptidase.6–11 So far, hydroxa-
mic acids have also been considered as highly promising anti-
cancer reagents: they can serve as inhibitors of matrix
metalloproteinases (MMPs) that are overexpressed in cancer
cells and cause tumor invasion and metastasis.12–17 The use of
hydroxamate
functional
groups
as
traditional
anticancer
reagents, however, is rather restricted within tumor cells
because the environment disrupts drug supply.18–21
Recently, numerous hydroxamate-bound metal complexes
have been explored as prodrugs targeting cancer cells. For
example, cobalt(III) complexes of hydroxamic acids are reported
to be potential prodrugs for hypoxia-selective anticancer
agents.22–25 As shown in Scheme 1, Hambley and co-workers
have provided experimental support for two possible pathways
of releasing the hydroxamate group (i.e., bio-reduction and
endogenous ligand exchange pathways).22,26 Recent studies on
the characterization and reactivity of cobalt(III)-hydroximato
and -hydroxamato complexes bearing TPA ligands revealed
their redox behaviors and ligand exchange reactions.27,28 Little is
known about the molecular-level mechanism of the hydrox-
amate transfer, which is the nal step of inhibiting the activity
of zinc-containing enzymes by hydroxamate, however.
Herein, we report a novel approach to investigate the
hydroxamate
transfer
activity
of
a
hydroxamatocobalt(II)
complex, [CoII(TBDAP)(CH3C(–NHO)O)]+ (1; TBDAP ¼ N,N-di-
tert-butyl-2,11-diaza[3.3](2,6)-pyridinophane), which is derived
from the reduction of [CoIII(TBDAP)(CH3C(]NO)O)]+ (2).29 1
was characterized by X-ray crystallography and multiple spec-
troscopic methods. To the best of our knowledge, 1 represents

a rare example of a structurally characterized cobalt(II) complex
bearing an acetohydroxamate ligand that has been prepared by
the reaction of a hydroximatocobalt(III) complex with a biolog-
ical reductant. In this work, we have examined the mechanism
of the hydroxamate transfer from 1 towards a zinc complex
which is a model of zinc-containing active sites in enzymes.30
Kinetic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations
support the notion that the hydroxamate transfer occurs
through a bimolecular mechanism. Moreover, 1 performs the
better inhibitory activity against matrix metalloproteinase-9
(MMP-9), compared to 2.
Results and discussion
The hydroxamatocobalt(II) complex, 1, was synthesized by
reacting 1 equiv. of acetohydroxamic acid in CH3CN with
a starting CoII complex, [CoII(TBDAP)(NO3)(H2O)]+, in the pres-
ence of 2 equiv. of triethylamine (TEA) under ambient condi-
tions, where the solution color changed from pink to orange.
The UV-vis spectrum of 1 in CH3CN at 25 C revealed two
characteristic
absorption
bands
at
lmax
¼
361
(3
¼
1900 M1 cm1) and 468 nm (3 ¼ 100 M1 cm1). The electro-
spray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) spectrum of 1
showed a single signal at mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio of 485.3
(calcd m/z 485.2); the mass and isotope distribution pattern
correspond to [Co(TBDAP)(CH3C(–NHO)O)]+ (Fig. S1†). The FT-
IR spectrum of 1 revealed the existence of N–H vibrational
frequency at 3206 cm1, which also corroborates the hypothesis
that acetohydroxamic acid is bound in the form of singly
deprotonated monoanionic hydroxamate rather than doubly
deprotonated dianionic hydroximate (Fig. S2†).31 The eﬀective
magnetic moment of 1 (meﬀ¼ 4.41 B.M.) was determined using
the 1H NMR spectroscopy method of Evans in CD3CN at 25 C,32
suggesting the high spin state (S ¼ 3/2) of the CoII ion (see ESI†).
1 has a slightly higher eﬀective magnetic moment due to spin–
orbit coupling.33 Thus, 1 is characterized as the cobalt(II)
complex with the singly deprotonated hydroxamate ligand.
The X-ray crystal structure of 1 reveals a mononuclear ace-
tohydroxamate
cobalt
complex
in a
distorted octahedral
geometry, in which the hydroxamate group coordinated in
a bidentate mode (Fig. 1). The average Co–O bond length (2.034
A) in 1 is similar to that of the hydroxamatocobalt(II) complex
with 6-(Me2Ph)2TPA ligand (2.038 A)34 but is longer than that in
2
(1.856
A)
and
other
hydroximatocobalt(III)
complexes.24,25,27–29,35 1 is the rare example of a structurally
characterized hydroxamatocobalt(II) complex, which would be
a reactive species towards inhibition of metalloenzymes.
It has been proposed that the hydroxamatocobalt(II) species
is a key intermediate in the inhibition against MMP.22,23 We
investigated the intermolecular transfer of the hydroxamate
group from 1 to a zinc complex, [ZnII(Me3-TACN)(NO3)]+ (3),
which is a model of the active site of MMP (Scheme S1†).30 Upon
addition of 3 to 1, the characteristic absorption band of 1 dis-
appeared (Fig. 2a). The hydroxamate transfer from 1 to 3 was
conrmed by ESI-MS analysis in the course of the reaction,
where the mass peak at m/z 485.3 corresponding to 1 vanished
with a concomitant appearance of the mass peak at m/z 309.2
corresponding
to
[ZnII(Me3-TACN)(CH3C(–NHO)O)]+
(4)
(Fig. 2b). Many attempts to isolate the product as single crystals
have been unsuccessful. The structural information was ob-
tained from an alternative synthetic route: the complex 4 was
crystallized from the solution of the reaction mixture of 3 and
excess acetohydroxamic acid in the presence of TEA (see ESI and
Fig. S3†). Although the equilibrium constant (Keq ¼ 5.9  102)
of the transfer reaction determined by optical titrations is small
(Fig. S4†), the reaction readily occurs upon the addition of an
excess amount of 3.

Kinetic studies of the hydroxamate group transfer reaction
from 1 to 3 were carried out in a mixture of CH3CN and H2O
(99 : 1). Upon addition of 3 (2.5 mM) to the solution of 1 (0.25
mM) at 10
C, the characteristic absorption bands of 1
decayed (Fig. 2). The rate constant increased with the concen-
tration of 3, providing a second-order rate constant (k2) of 4.0(2)
M1 s1 (Fig. 3a). The temperature dependence of the k2 value
was investigated in the range of 253–283 K, from which a linear
Eyring plot was obtained with activation parameters of DH‡ ¼
59(3) kJ mol1 and DS‡ ¼ 5(1) J mol1 K1 (Fig. 3b). The
observed data suggest that the hydroxamate transfer reaction
occurs through a bimolecular mechanism, in which the
formation of an undetected [(TBDAP)Co–(CH3C(–NHO)O)–
Zn(Me3-TACN)]3+ species is the rate-determining step.
DFT calculations were performed for the hydroxamate
transfer reaction (see ESI†). According to the DFT results
(Fig. 4), the oxygen atom in the NHO moiety of hydroxamate in
the Co(II) complex is rst coordinated by the Zn(II) complex at
Int1. Subsequently, the carbonyl oxygen of hydroxamate is
transferred from the Co(II) center to the Zn(II) center via a tran-
sition state (TS1) to form a product complex (Int3). The free
energy prole also suggests that the reaction is not a very
favorable process thermodynamically, which is reasonably
consistent with the small equilibrium constant (vide supra).
On the other hand, upon addition of 3 to a solution of 2 (0.5
mM), 2 remained intact without showing any absorption spec-
tral change (Fig. S5a†), indicating that 2 is not able to conduct
the hydroxamate group transfer reaction. The ESI-MS spectrum
of the reaction solutions conrmed that no transferred product
was formed (Fig. S5b†). Notably, the transfer reaction occurs by
adding a biological reductant such as ascorbic acid, which is
a 2H+/2e donor. Addition of 0.5 equiv. of ascorbic acid to
a reaction mixture of 2 and 3 resulted in the conversion of 2 to 1,
and then the hydroxamate in 1 was transferred to 3 (Fig. S6a†).
Aer the reaction had been completed, 4 was produced, which
was conrmed by ESI-MS (Fig. S6b†).
The cyclic voltammograms of 1 and 2 in CH3CN exhibit
a reversible couple between the Co(II) and Co(III) complexes
(Fig. S7†). From the E1/2 values, the one-electron redox poten-
tials of 1 and 2 were determined to be 0.28 and 0.47 V (versus
SCE), respectively. The redox potential of 2 is more negative
than that of ascorbic acid.36 In earlier studies, however, the
protonation of hydroximatocobalt(III) complexes resulted in
more positive potential aﬀording facile reduction.27 The proton-
assisted reduction process was conrmed by the cyclic voltam-
metry (CV) experiments, where the redox signal of 2 dis-
appeared with the concomitant generation of the redox signal of
1 upon addition of proton (Fig. S8†). Alternatively, the hydrox-
amatocobalt(III) complex, [CoIII(TBDAP)(CH3C(–NHO)O)]2+ (5),
which is not only a protonated form of 2 but also an one elec-
tron oxidized species of 1, was prepared by the reaction of 2 with
1 equiv. of HClO4 (Fig. S11†). The formation of 5 was conrmed
by UV-vis and ESI-MS (Fig. S12†). 2 and 5 are interconvertible
through the acid–base chemistry.
In order to verify the inuence of 1, relative to acetohy-
droxamic acid or 2, on a zinc-containing enzyme, their inhibi-
tory activity against MMP-9 was evaluated. Aer incubation of
activated MMP-9 with a peptide as a substrate in the presence of
1, 2, or acetohydroxamic acid, the amount of the substrate that
was not cleaved by the enzyme was analyzed. Inhibition against
MMP-9 by 1 and 2, relative to that by acetohydroxamic acid, was
77(2)% and 24(3)%, respectively. The more noticeable inhibi-
tory activity of 1 than 2 against MMP-9 was expected from our
reactivity and mechanistic studies (vide supra).
To visualize possible interactions between 1 and MMP-9 at
the molecular level, docking studies were carried out employing
the catalytic domain of MMP-9 (PDB 4H3X).37 As illustrated in
Fig. 5, 1 could access to the catalytic cleof MMP-9 where three
histidine residues (i.e., H226, H230, and H236) are coordinated
to the active Zn(II) center. According to the docked structures, 1
may have multiple contacts with the catalytic domain of MMP-9:
(i) hydrogen bonding {[C–H from 1 and oxygen (O) donor atoms
from A189, A191, E227, and D235; a nitrogen (N) donor atom
from H236] and [C–H from H236 and an O donor atom from 1]}
and (ii) C–H/p interaction (C–H from the side chain of L187
and H236 and pyridine groups from 1). In addition, the repre-
sentative
conformations
exhibited
the
possibility
of
the
hydroxamate moiety onto 1 to be located close to the Zn(II)
center in the catalytic domain of MMP-9. Collectively, 1 may
interact with the catalytic site of MMP-9.
To explore how the substituent onto the ligand aﬀects the
hydroxamate transfer reactivity towards 3 and the inhibitory
activity of Co(II) complexes against MMP-9, a benzohydrox-
amatocobalt(II) complex, [CoII(TBDAP)(C6H5C(–NHO)O)]+ (6),
was prepared (see ESI†). Kinetic studies for the reaction of 6
with 3 were carried out, aﬀording k2 of 4.9(5)  101 M1 s1 at
10 C (Fig. S16 and S17†). The equilibrium constant for the

transfer reaction from 6 was also determined as 4.4  102
(Fig. S18†). These results are similar to those of the hydrox-
amate transfer reaction of 1. Under our experimental condi-
tions, the inhibitory activity of 6 towards MMP-9 was same as
that of 1 (data not shown). Thus, replacing a structural moiety of
the ligand from acetohydroxamate to benzohydroxamate may
not signicantly change the hydroxamate transfer reactivity
towards 3 and the inhibitory activity of its corresponding Co(II)
complex against MMP-9.
Based on the experimental and computational studies, it is
suggested that the hydroxamate transfer can be accelerated in
the presence of a weak acid, which reduces the coordination
ability of the hydroxamate group in the hydroxamatocobalt(II)
complex. Thus, we further investigated the equilibrium between
1 and 4 under acidic conditions. By adding acetic acid to the
solution of 1 and 3, the absorption band of 1 exponentially
decreased with increasing concentration of the acetic acid
(Fig. S19†). This result indicates that, in the presence of acetic
acid, the equilibrium is shied in favor of 4, which was also
conrmed by ESI-MS (Fig. S20†). Taken together, the hydrox-
amate transfer reaction eﬀectively occurs in relatively acidic
conditions.
Conclusions
We have succeeded in the isolation and structural character-
ization of a hydroxamatocobalt(II) complex bearing macrocyclic
tetradentate N4 ligand, [CoII(TBDAP)(CH3C(–NHO)O)]+ (1), in
which the acetohydroxamate ligand is bound in a bidentate
mode. The intermediate is further characterized by various
physicochemical methods such as FT-IR, UV-vis, and ESI-MS. 1
exhibited hydroxamate group transfer reactivity towards a zin-
c(II) complex. The observation of the hydroxamate transfer
between metal complexes is unprecedented. In addition, the
proton-assisted reduction mechanism was examined by the CV
measurements. Kinetic studies suggest that the transfer reac-
tion proceeds by a bimolecular mechanism, which is supported
by DFT calculations. Moreover, the inhibitory activity of 1
towards a zinc-containing enzyme, MMP-9, was conrmed. The
interaction and accessibility of 1 to MMP-9 as well as the
substitution eﬀect onto the hydroxamate ligand were also
examined.
