Abstract 
Background:  Emerging data suggests that volatile anesthetic agents may have organ protection properties in the 
setting of critical illness. The purpose of this study was to better understand the effect of inflammation on cerebral 
subcellular energetics in animals exposed to two different anesthetic agents—a GABA agonist (propofol) and a vola-
tile agent (isoflurane).
Results:  Forty-eight Sprague–Dawley rats were anesthetized with isoflurane or propofol. In each group, rats were 
randomized to celiotomy and closure (sham) or cecal ligation and puncture (inflammation [sepsis model]) for 8 h. 
Brain tissue oxygen saturation and the oxidation state of cytochrome ­aa3 were measured. Brain tissue was extracted 
using the freeze-blow technique. All rats experienced progressive increases in tissue oxygenation and cytochrome ­aa3 
reduction over time. Inflammation had no impact on cytochrome ­aa3, but isoflurane caused significant cytochrome 
­aa3 reduction. During isoflurane (not propofol) anesthesia, inflammation led to an increase in lactate (+ 0.64 vs. 
− 0.80 mEq/L, p = 0.0061). There were no differences in ADP:ATP ratios between groups. In the isoflurane (not 
propofol) group, inflammation increased the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (62%, p = 0.0012), heme 
oxygenase-1 (67%, p = 0.0011), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (31%, p = 0.023) in the brain. Animals exposed to 
inflammation and isoflurane (but not propofol) exhibited increased expression of protein carbonyls (9.2 vs. 7.0 nM/mg 
protein, p = 0.0050) and S-nitrosylation (49%, p = 0.045) in the brain. RNA sequencing identified an increase in heat 
shock protein 90 and NF-κβ inhibitor mRNA in the inflammation/isoflurane group.
Conclusions:  In the setting of inflammation, rats exposed to isoflurane show increased hypoxia-inducible factor-1α 
expression despite a lack of hypoxia, increased oxidative stress in the brain, and increased serum lactate, all of which 
suggest a relative increase in anaerobic metabolism compared to propofol. Differences in oxidative stress as well as 
heat shock protein 90 and NF-κβ inhibitor may account for the differential expression of cerebral hypoxia-inducible 
factor-1α during inflammation.

Background
Commonly used anesthetic agents have varying 
organ-protective properties that have the potential 
to attenuate the impact of stressors such as ischemia, 
reperfusion, and inflammation. Pre-exposure with 
volatile anesthetic agents (VAAs) has produced 
organ-protective effects in several settings, includ-
ing myocardial infarction, cerebral ischemia, and 
ischemia–reperfusion [1]. This effect is referred to 
as anesthetic preconditioning (APC) and is mecha-
nistically related to ischemic preconditioning (IPC) 
[2]. While primarily studied in stroke and myocardial 
infarction models, isoflurane pre-treatment has been 
shown to preserve hemodynamics in experimental sep-
sis [3, 4], and recent comparisons between VAAs and 
GABA agonists in animals suggest a mortality benefit 
in animals exposed to VAAs [5, 6]. A more recent pilot

study comparing VAAs to GABA agonists in humans 
with ARDS showed improved oxygenation and reduced 
endothelial injury and inflammation in the VAA group 
[7].
While VAAs are not typically used in the ICU setting, 
if the organ-protective effects observed in the operating 
room can be extended to pathologies commonly seen in 
the ICU (e.g. sepsis), VAAs may offer a new treatment 
modality for some critical illnesses. The recent devel-
opment of a portable vaporizer that can be used with 
any ICU ventilator [7] may facilitate the introduction of 
VAAs into the ICU setting.
Mitochondria play a central role in the metabolic 
activity of both healthy and diseased eukaryotic organ-
isms, including during sepsis, primarily through their 
central role in oxidative phosphorylation. This effi-
cient process produces ATP as electrons pass down the 
electron transport chain (ETC), generating a proton 
gradient which drives ATP synthase [8]. Oxidative phos-
phorylation can be altered by changes in mitochondrial 
oxygen supply, the availability of electron donors from 
the tricyclic acid (TCA) cycle, or direct inhibition of the 
cytochromes [8]. The impact of sepsis on subcellular 
energetics and metabolism is still not clear [8].
Both VAAs and GABA agonists are known to affect 
subcellular metabolism—VAAs inhibit Complex I [9] 
and lead to anaerobic metabolism and lactate produc-
tion [10]. Propofol does not appear to inhibit Complex 
I [11] but may inhibit Complex II [12]. Differences in 
metabolism between sedating agents may explain their 
differential effects on both animal models and humans 
exposed to sepsis. The primary purpose of this study was 
to compare the impact of inflammation on brain metabo-
lism (oxidation state of cytochrome ­aa3 ­[CytOX] derived 
from broadband near infrared spectroscopy [NIRS]) 
in an established animal model of sepsis (cecal ligation 
and puncture [CLP]) using two different anesthetic regi-
mens—VAAs (isoflurane) and GABA agonists (propo-
fol). We used the CLP model because it is thought to be 
a more realistic model of human sepsis than, for instance, 
lipopolysaccharide infusion [13]. Secondary outcomes 
included changes in ADP:ATP ratio, oxidative stress, and 
expression of proteins involved in subcellular energetics.
Results
Markers of illness severity
Blood pressure, intravenous fluid, lactic acid, base defi-
cit, glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and 
serum interleukin data are presented in Table  1 and 
Fig. 1. All 48 animals completed the study and were ana-
lyzed, and there were no adverse events. In both the iso-
flurane and propofol groups, animals exposed to CLP 
required more fluid, had lower mean arterial pressure 
after 8 h, higher base deficits, and increase IL-6, IL-1β, 
and TNF-α at 8 h as compared to sham controls. 
In rats anesthetized with isoflurane, inflammation led 
to an increase in lactate (+ 0.64 mEq/L vs. − 0.80 mEq/L, 
p = 0.0061), whereas in rats anesthetized with propofol, 
inflammation had no impact on the change in lactate 
(− 0.26 mEq/L vs. − 0.21 mEq/L, p = 0.84). After induc-
tion and establishment of arterial access (prior to sham 
surgery or CLP), rats anesthetized with isoflurane had 
significantly higher lactate values than rats anesthetized 
with propofol (2.13 vs. 1.0, p < 0.0001).
Tissue oxygenation and cytochrome ­aa3 oxidation state 
­(CytOX)
Rats anesthetized with both isoflurane and propofol 
experienced progressive increases in tissue oxygenation 
(decrease in deoxyhemoglobin, increases in oxyhemo-
globin) and decreases in ­CytOX over time (Fig. 2). Based 
on time series analysis (permutation F-test, see Addi-
tional file  1: Statistical Analysis of NIRS Data), neither 
hemoglobin or oxy-hemoglobin were affected by inflam-
mation or the anesthetic modality. In contrast, anesthetic 
modality (p = 0.006) but not inflammation (p = 0.71) had 
a significant effect on ­CytOX. 
ADP:ATP ratio
At the end of 8 h of anesthesia, ADP:ATP ratios in the 
brain were no different in septic rats than in controls, for 
animals exposed to both isoflurane (1.39 [0.33–4.0] vs. 
1.06 [0.24–2.4], p = 0.282) and propofol (0.61 [0.27–0.95] 
vs. 0.715 [0.21–1.2], p = 0.714, Fig. 3).
Protein expression
In the isoflurane group, inflammation led to an 
increase in the expression of hypoxia-inducible fac-
tor-1 (HIF-1α, 62%, p = 0.0012), heme oxygenase-1 
(HO-1, 67%, p = 0.0011), inducible nitric oxide syn-
thase (iNOS, 31%, p = 0.023), and B cell lymphoma 2 
(bcl-2, 34%, p = 0.022) in the brain. In animals anes-
thetized with propofol, there were no differences in 
protein expression between groups (Fig. 4).
Oxidative stress
Septic animals anesthetized with isoflurane exhib-
ited increased expression of protein carbonyls (9.2 vs. 
7.0  nM/mg protein, p = 0.0050) and S-nitrosylation 
(49%, p = 0.045) in the brain. In animals anesthetized 
with propofol, protein carbonyls were unchanged in 
the brain and S-nitrosylation was decreased (− 30%, 
p = 0.027, Figs. 5 and 6).

Messenger RNA expression
Differentially expressed (on exposure to inflammation) 
genes related to metabolism, oxidative phosphoryla-
tion, oxidative stress, and cellular protection are pre-
sented in Table  2. For completeness, all statistically 
significant up and down-regulated genes identified by 
differential expression analysis of RNA sequencing are 
presented in Additional file 2: Table S1. In rats anes-
thetized with isoflurane, exposure to inflammation 
led to upregulation of 9 different heat shock protein 
(hsp) genes, upregulation of 7 ATPase-related genes, 
downregulation of 4 lipid-metabolism related genes, 
and down-regulation of 3 insulin-like growth factor 
(IGF)-1/IGF-1 binding protein-related genes. Adeno-
sine A2a receptor and lactate dehydrogenase B were 
also upregulated in response to inflammation. In rats 
anesthetized with propofol, exposure to inflammation 
led to downregulation of 3 lipid-metabolism related 
genes, and down-regulation of 3 IGF-1/IBF binding 
protein-related genes. Additionally, NFKB inhibitor 
alpha, hypoxia inducible factor 3 subunit alpha, von 
Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor, and lipopolysac-
charide-induced TNF factor were also upregulated in 
response to inflammation.

Discussion
While not generally thought of as one of the primary 
organ systems affected by sepsis, the central nerv-
ous system is adversely, and in some cases permanently 
impacted by the dysregulated host response to infec-
tion [14]. Furthermore, sepsis is a known risk factor for 
long-term cognitive dysfunction in survivors of critical 
illness [15]. Thus, a better understanding of the impact 
of inflammation on the brain, and potential protective 
mechanisms, is needed.
Emerging data suggest that VAAs favorably impact sur-
vival and organ dysfunction in both animals and humans 
exposed to inflammation and sepsis [5–7]. While the 
mechanisms of APC have been well-described, virtually 
all of the research on APC has focused on either myocar-
dial or neurologic dysfunction following ischemia [16]. 
APC is complex and known to involve activation of the 
myocardial ­KATP channels, activation of protein kinase 
C, generation of oxidative species, as well as alterations 
in the mitochondrial permeability transition pore [16]. 
Metabolic differences in VAAs and GABA agonists are 
well-described [10, 17], but these studies do not include 
animals exposed to inflammation. Our study utilized an 
animal model of inflammation to better understand the 
role of different anesthetic agents on cellular metabolism 
and oxidative stress during critical illness. Our results, 
some of which are described schematically in Fig. 7, sug-
gest the following.

Isoflurane leads to anaerobic metabolism
The ability of VAAs to induce lactic acidosis has been 
described in multiple animals including humans [10, 18]. 
Prior to cecal ligation and puncture, rats in the isoflurane 
group exhibited higher lactate levels than rats in the 
propofol group (2.13 vs. 1.12  mEq/L, p < 0.0001). Inter-
estingly, rats in the isoflurane group exhibited higher lac-
tate levels 8 h after sham surgery (1.88 vs. 0.851 mEq/L, 
p < 0.0001) as well as after CLP (2.48 vs. 0.846  mEq/L, 
p = 0.0002) when compared to rats anesthetized with 
propofol.
Exposure of mitochondrial preparations to VAAs has 
revealed that halothane, isoflurane, and sevoflurane all 
inhibit Complex I of the ETC [9]. Inhibition of Complex 
I by isoflurane leads to an accumulation of NADH and 
pyruvate, while still allowing FADH to donate some elec-
trons to enter the ETC via Complex II. NADH inhibits 
pyruvate dehydrogenase and is oxidized to ­NAD+ during 
the conversion of pyruvate to lactate via lactate dehydro-
genase (LDH)—increased concentrations of pyruvate, 
coupled with pyruvate dehydrogenase inhibition would 
therefore be expected to increase the production of lac-
tate. These effects are consistent with our observation of 
lactic acidosis in rats exposed to isoflurane.
While exposure of isolated mitochondria to isoflu-
rane does not produce Complex IV (cytochrome ­aa3) 
inhibition, we observed a reduction in cytochrome 
­aa3 measured in real time in our intact animal model 
(similar to what our laboratory has observed following

(dotted line), bounded by 95% confidence intervals. Based on a permutation F-test, neither deoxy-hemoglobin or oxyhemoglobin were affected by 
the anesthetic agent or sepsis, however the anesthetic agent (but not sepsis) did have a significant effect on ­CytOX

no difference between groups

injection of cyanide [19]). The source of this inhibition 
is not known, although candidate agents include nitric 
oxide, peroxynitrate, and carbon monoxide. Reactive 
species have been shown to directly inhibit Complex IV 
[20], as does carbon monoxide, a byproduct of the anti-
oxidant protein HO-1. VAAs have been demonstrated 
to increase reactive oxidative species (ROS) produc-
tion [16], inducing oxidative stress [21] as well as HO-1 
expression [22].
Isoflurane, not inflammation, inhibits the electron 
transport chain in the brain
We found no evidence that inflammation itself leads to 
ETC inhibition. Early studies suggesting that inflamma-
tion led to ­CytOX reduction used discrete wavelength 
NIRS devices incapable of accurately measuring changes 
in ­CytOX [23] and did not control for the anesthetic agent 
used. Early work using a 3 wavelength NIRS device sug-
gested intravenous injection of E. coli leads to a rapid 
reduction in ­CytOX [24]. Similar results were obtained by 
Fig. 4  Protein expression data (upper) and representative raw data (lower) for animals anesthetized with isoflurane (bcl-2 [a median + IQR], HIF-1α 
[b mean + 95% confidence interval (CI)], HO-1 [c mean + 95% CI for isoflurane, median + IQR for propofol], iNOS [d mean + 95% CI for isoflurane, 
median + IQR for propofol) *denotes a statistically significant difference between animals exposed to sepsis and controls

another group that injected S. pneumonia into rabbit cer-
ebrospinal fluid (CSF) and measured ­CytOX. Both of these 
studies utilized volatile anesthetic agents. In contrast, 
Park et al. [25] injected E. coli into the CSF of newborn 
piglets anesthetized with thiopental, measured ­CytOX and 
reported an increase in ­CytOX.
Our study differed from prior work in several respects. 
First, we used a live, polymicrobial infection model that 
is thought to be more reproducible and clinically relevant 
than direct injection of bacteria or endotoxin. Second, 
we used equipment that has been tested and proven to 
measure changes in ­CytOX independent of changes in tis-
sue oxygenation ­(StO2) [19]. Third, we measured ­CytOX 
continuously for 8 h. Fourth, in dissecting the temporalis 
muscle, we were able to eliminate any potential interfer-
ence from myoglobin in our measurements.
It may be that endotoxin does inhibit cytochrome ­aa3, 
but at higher concentrations than we were able to achieve 
with our 8-h CLP model. Measuring ­CytOX accurately 
beyond 8  h is technically challenging as it requires the 
use of a stereotactic frame and general anesthesia for 
protracted periods of time. Although the time course of 
bacterial load after cecal ligation and puncture is not well 
described, evidence from both mouse and rat models 
suggests that colony forming units measured in the blood 
peak at approximately 6–12 h [26, 27].
Early inflammation does not impact ADP:ATP ratio 
in the brain
Compared to controls, we observed no difference in the 
ADP:ATP ratio in the brain of rats exposed to inflamma-
tion for 8 h (for both the isoflurane and propofol groups). 
This is consistent with other published work. Synthesis 
of data from multiple animal models of varying severity 
and time points suggests that mitochondrial dysfunc-
tion causing energy failure requires approximately 24 h 
of inflammation and sepsis exposure [8] and similar 
results have been demonstrated in septic human surgical 
patients [28–31].
Isoflurane induces and propofol attenuates cerebral 
oxidative stress in early inflammation
In animals anesthetized with isoflurane and exposed to 
8 h of CLP, oxidative stress was detected in brain when 
measured with both protein carbonyls and S-nitros-
ylation. In contrast, animals anesthetized with propo-
fol exhibited decreased oxidative stress in the brain as 
measured with S-nitrosylation (no difference in pro-
tein carbonyls). Propofol has previously been reported 
to offer some protection from oxidative stress in ani-
mal models of ischemia–reperfusion [12] and neuronal 
excitotoxicity [32].
Inflammation leads to non‑hypoxic HIF‑1α upregulation 
in the brain
HIF-1α upregulation has been observed in the setting of 
inflammation [33–36] but these studies did not report 
tissue oxygenation. In the isoflurane group, we also 
observed HIF-1α upregulation in the brain, although we 
identified an increase in cerebral ­StO2. This suggests that 
HIF-1α upregulation in inflammation caused by a non-
hypoxic stimulus.
ROS (which are produced in the setting of both 
hypoxia and hyperoxia) have been shown to be an essen-
tial component of HIF-1α stabilization and overexpres-
sion [37–39] and may explain other observations of 
non-hypoxic HIF-1α overexpression [40–43]. While

we did not measure ROS explicitly, we also observed 
an inflammation-induced increase in iNOS expression, 
increased markers of oxidative stress, and an increase in 
the anti-oxidant protein HO-1 in our isoflurane group, all 
of which suggest that increased ROS production may be 
responsible for the observed difference in HIF-1α in ani-
mals exposed to isoflurane.
Interestingly, we could not detect any evidence of cer-
ebral HIF-1α expression in our propofol groups (control 
and inflammation). HIF-1α is rapidly degraded by pro-
lyl hydroxylases (PHD) and is not detectable in normal 
tissues unless PHDs are stabilized by lack of oxygen or 
the presence of oxidative stress. Our observations are 
consistent with previous literature that suggests propo-
fol attenuates oxidative stress in the brain [12, 32] and 
Fig. 7  Potential mechanisms for our observations including references to other studies. Species measured in our study are marked in yellow. 
Propofol and isoflurane are known to inhibit Complex I and II of the ETC, respectively. Our data suggest that animals anesthetized with isoflurane, 
inflammation leads to increased expression of HIF-1α, HO-1, and iNOS, as well as an increase in Hsp90 mRNA and increased oxidative stress (the 
latter of which promotes through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway). Isoflurane also causes an increase in lactate production as well as inhibition 
of Complex IV based on NIRS analysis. Our data also suggest that animals anesthetized with Propofol express no detectable HIF-1α, and in the 
setting of inflammation experience an increase in NF-κβ inhibitor, which prevents transcription of basal HIF-1α, as well as no detectable increase in 
oxidative stress
Page 12 of 18
Thiele et al. BMC Neurosci           (2019) 20:34 
inhibits HIF-1α expression in a dose-dependent fashion 
[44].
Additionally, we found evidence of increased Hsp90 
mRNA expression in animals anesthetized with iso-
flurane and exposed to sepsis. Hsp90 competes with 
RACK1 to bind HIF-1α. RACK1 promotes ubiquitina-
tion (and subsequent degradation) of HIF-1α, and inhi-
bition of Hsp90 is known to lead to HIF-1α degradation 
[45]. Increase Hsp90 expression may therefore represent 
a second non-hypoxic mechanism for increased HIF-1α 
expression in the setting of inflammation.
Messenger RNA implications on organ protection
Analysis of mRNA expression suggests that isoflu-
rane and propofol may produce differential metabolic 
responses as well as activate distinct organ protective 
pathways when animals are faced with an inflammatory 
stressor. In animals anesthetized with isoflurane, inflam-
mation leads to upregulation of 9 distinct Hsp genes, 
which are known to be protective in a variety of stress 
states including sepsis [46]. Interestingly, this group also 
exhibited an increase in expression of lactate dehydroge-
nase (consistent with increased serum lactate) and aden-
osine A2a receptor mRNA, the latter of which is a known 
mediator of hepatic preconditioning [47].
In animals anesthetized with propofol, inflammation 
leads to upregulation of NF-κβ inhibitor α mRNA. NF-κβ 
increases basal HIF-1α expression [48], thus increased 
inhibitor expression might lead to lower baseline produc-
tion of HIF-1α (consistent with our protein expression 
results). In this same group, both HIF-3α (which may 
lead to decreased basal HIF-1α mRNA expression [49]) 
and VHL (which destroys ubiquitinated HIF-1α [50]) 
mRNA were over-expressed, both consistent with the 
lack of HIF-1α expression seen on Western blotting.
Limitations
Our study has several limitations. It was conducted in 
rats, which limits its applicability in humans. Because 
accurate, continuous measurement of ­CytOX requires 
complete immobility which could only be achieved under 
general anesthesia, our animal model only included 
approximately 8 h of exposure to inflammation (the con-
centration of bacteria in blood peak at approximately 
6–12  h after cecal ligation [26, 27], but ATP depletion 
does not occur until later), and did not include a group 
with no exposure to any anesthetic agents. Thus, our 
results cannot be generalized to non-anesthetized ani-
mals or late stage inflammation and sepsis. Because the 
propofol group received intraperitoneal ketamine-xyla-
zine for induction (anticipated to last 20–30  min), and 
not a pure propofol anesthetic, we cannot exclude poten-
tial confounding effects from these two induction agents. 
mRNA data, while useful for hypothesis generation, 
requires confirmation with inhibitory studies in order to 
confirm any mechanistic hypotheses.
Conclusions
Isoflurane and propofol lead to differential metabolic 
responses to inflammation. Isoflurane leads to devel-
opment of lactic acidosis and reduction in ­CytOX as 
compared to propofol. In the setting of inflammation, 
isoflurane led to increased oxidative stress, HIF-1α, 
iNOS, bcl-2, and HO-1 overexpression. HIF-1α expres-
sion in the setting of inflammation and isoflurane is 
likely mediated by both increased oxidative stress as 
well as increased Hsp90. In contrast, propofol attenu-
ates inflammation-induced oxidative stress in the brain, 
preventing cerebral HIF-1α expression. Propofol also 
facilitates inflammation-induced expression of NF-κβ 
inhibitor mRNA, which may prevent transcription of 
basal HIF-1α. Many of these findings (increased oxida-
tive stress, HIF-1α and bcl-2 expression after isoflurane 
exposure) are consistent with prior work on APC and 
may play a role in the organ protection observed by pre-
vious authors during sepsis [3–7]. Future work is needed 
to better understand the potential protective role of heat 
shock proteins and the adenosine 2A receptor in septic 
animals exposed to VAAs, as well as to translate these 
findings into improvements in relevant clinical outcomes 
in humans.
Materials and methods
This study was approved by the animal care and use 
committee (IACUC) at the University of Virginia (pro-
tocol 4140) and conforms with the Guide for the Care 
and Use of Laboratory Animals, 8th Edition published 
by the National Institutes of Health (revised 2011). In 
order to allow other investigators to accurately assess 
the reproducibility of our work, we have included a 
more detailed explanation of our methods in the Addi-
tional file 3: Digital Content: Digital Content.
General preparation
Ten-week-old male Sprague–Dawley rats (Envigo Cor-
poration, Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, UK) weighing 
on average 341  g were induced with either 5% isoflu-
rane in 100% oxygen for 12 min (isoflurane group) or 
100–10  mg/kg ketamine-xylazine (propofol group) 
injected intraperitoneally, after which they were oro-
tracheally intubated with a 16 gauge intravenous cath-
eter and connected to a mechanical ventilator (initial 
settings 1  Hz, 3.2  mL tidal volume, ­FiO2 1.0). Minute 
ventilation was adjusted to keep end tidal ­CO2 ­(ETCO2) 
between 35 and 45  mm Hg. The right femoral artery 
(cut-down) and either a tail vein or the right femoral 
Page 13 of 18
Thiele et al. BMC Neurosci           (2019) 20:34 
vein were cannulated with 24 gauge intravenous cath-
eters. General anesthesia was maintained with either 
isoflurane (starting dose 1.5%, inspired) in 100% oxy-
gen or propofol (average infusion rate 367 µg/kg/min) 
and depth of anesthesia was confirmed by toe pinching 
every 30 min. Temperature was measured using a rectal 
probe and controlled with a heating pad to a target of 
37 °C. Arterial oxygen saturation ­(SpO2) was measured 
on the left lower extremity food pad.
Near infrared spectroscopy
To minimize the interference of the scalp with our 
spectroscopy readings, we exposed the parietal bones 
of the skull bilaterally by dissecting the temporalis 
muscles through scalp incisions. Using a stereotactic 
frame we positioned emission and receiving fiberoptic 
bundles on opposite sides of the skull, on-axis with one 
another. The emission fiber was connected to a halogen 
light source and the receiving fiber was connected to 
a spectrometer (QE-Pro, Ocean Optics, Dunedin, FL), 
the light source output was recorded using a second 
spectrometer, and a transfer function was used to cor-
rect for minor differences between the two. A differen-
tial pathlength factor (DPF) correction was applied to 
the tissue spectra as previously described [19]. Both 
waveforms were smoothed over 20  nm, after which 
a broadband near infrared spectroscopy algorithm 
(750–925 nm, 1 nm intervals) was utilized to measure 
changes in the relative concentration of hemoglobin, 
oxyhemoglobin, and ­CytOX [19].
Surgical procedure(s) and sample harvesting
After initiation of general anesthesia and achievement of 
both arterial and venous access, 2 mL of arterial blood 
was withdrawn for analysis and replaced with 2  mL of 
warm normal saline (NS). Among the blood samples, 
200 μL was utilized for arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis 
­(CG4+ and ­Chem8+ cartridges, Abbot i-Stat, Lake Bluff, 
IL) and the remainder was injected into a serum collec-
tion tube for 45  min, after which it was centrifuged at 
4 °C, the serum separated, and stored at − 80 °C.
The abdomen was shaved and prepared with three 
swipes of 70% isopropyl alcohol swabs, followed by 
scrubbing with 3 mL of 2% chlorhexidine gluconate and 
70% isopropyl alcohol. A sterile drape was applied over 
the entire surgical field. Using sterile technique, a 2–3 cm 
midline celiotomy was performed. Animals were divided 
into sham (S) and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) 
groups in alternating fashion, first for isoflurane (24 
total) and then for propofol-based (24 total) anesthet-
ics. In the controls, the cecum was identified, removed 
from the abdomen, and replaced back into the abdomen. 
In the animals exposed to inflammation, the cecum was 
identified and ligated (~ 90% by volume) with a size 0 silk 
suture, then 10 holes were placed using a 16 gauge nee-
dle (5 on the mesenteric border, 5 on the anti-mesenteric 
border), and patency was confirmed by extruding fecal 
contents through each hole.
In all groups, the celiotomy was closed in two layers—
first, the muscular layer with 4–0 running silk sutures, 
followed by skin closure with clips. The animal was then 
placed in the prone position, the skull was trans-illumi-
nated with a halogen light source, and commencement 
of NIRS recordings began. Hypotension, defined as mean 
arterial pressure < 80 mm Hg, was initially treated with 
intravenous warm NS (up to 3.3 mL/kg/h). If this was not 
effective, the anesthetic dose was reduced (and depth of 
anesthesia confirmed) when possible.
All animals were maintained under general anesthesia 
for 8 h after the celiotomy, after which an additional 2 mL 
of arterial blood was drawn for analysis. The stereotactic 
frame was removed, depth of general anesthesia was con-
firmed, bilateral burr holes were placed, and animals were 
euthanized using the freeze blow technique, in which the 
supratentorial brain was ejected onto a liquid ­N2-cooled 
copper plate using a high pressure air hose, immediately 
submerged in liquid ­N2, and stored at − 80 °C until used 
for biochemical analysis.
Immediately prior to analysis, the extracted tissue was 
removed from storage at − 80 °C and individually finely 
ground in liquid ­N2 with a pestle and mortar. Ten to fifty 
milligrams of tissue powder from each sample were used 
to measure ADP:ATP ratio, protein expression, and oxi-
dative stress.
Enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA)
Arterial blood was immediately placed in BD Vacutainer 
tubes (Becton Dickson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) after collec-
tion, mixed by hand, and kept at room temperature for 
45 min, after which it was centrifuged (2000 g) at 4 °C for 
20  min. Using a micropipetter, the serum was removed 
and immediately stored at − 80 °C for analysis. Interleukin 
(IL)-6 (RAB0311, Sigma, St. Louis, MO), IL-1β (RAB0277, 
Sigma), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (ab100785, 
Abcam, Cambridge, UK) were measured according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. For all assays, both the stand-
ards and unknowns were measured in duplicate.
ADP:ATP ratio
The ratio of ADP to ATP was measured using biolumi-
nescence kit (MAK135, Sigma) according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions. Briefly, a working reagent was 
added to the pulverized cells, inducing lysis and releas-
ing both ADP and ATP. The addition of luciferase and 
Page 14 of 18
Thiele et al. BMC Neurosci           (2019) 20:34 
d-Luciferin to the lysed product allowed for the meas-
urement of ATP using a luminometer to measure rela-
tive light units ­(RLUA). ADP enzyme was then added 
to convert ADP to ATP, and an additional luminescent 
measurement ­(RLUC) combined with a measurement of 
background luminescence ­(RLUB) resulted in an estimate 
of ADP:ATP ratio based on the following equation:
Immunoblotting
Fifty milligrams of tissue powder was suspended in 
500  μL of ice cold phosphate buffer saline (PBS) con-
taining a commercially-prepared protease and phos-
phatase inhibitor cocktail (Halt™, Thermo-Fisher #78443, 
Waltham, MA). Samples were gently mixed, centrifuged 
at 10,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was col-
lected and used either for nuclear protein extraction or 
for total protein lysis preparation.
Nuclear proteins were extracted using commercially 
available mammalian cell and tissue nuclear extraction 
kit (abcam ab113474, Cambridge, MA) by following the 
manufacturer’s protocol with the exception of adding 100 
uM ­CoCl2 to the extraction buffer (RIPA) in order to sta-
bilize prolyl hydroxylase and thereby preventing HIF-1α 
degradation in the presence of atmospheric oxygen.
For total protein extraction, 250  μL of ice cold lysis 
buffer (RIPA) containing a protease and phosphatase 
inhibitor cocktail (Halt™) was added to the pellet, which 
was subsequently sonicated on ice (3 cycles of 10 pulses, 
power 5, Fisher Scientific Sonic Dismembrator Model 
F60, Pittsburgh, PA). Protein lysates were centrifuged at 
13,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C.
Protein concentrations were determined using a Bicin-
choninic Acid (BCA) kit (Thermo Scientific). Ten to thirty 
micrograms of total protein (50 ug for HIF-1α) was heat-
denatured at 95C, loaded onto 4–20% Tris–Glycine poly-
acrylamide gradient gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and 
electrophoresed. Proteins were transferred to PVDF mem-
brane (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), blocked at room 
temperature for 1  h in SuperBlock phosphate-buffered 
saline (PBS) Blocking Buffer (Thermo-Fisher # 37515) 
and incubated at 4 °C overnight with primary antibodies: 
anti-HIF-1α (1:2000, rabbit-mAb # 14179, Cell Signaling 
[Danvers, MA]; note: for HIF-1α, overnight incubation 
with primary antibodies was repeated after washing three 
times with PBST), anti-heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1, 1:3000, 
mouse-mAb # NBP1-97507, NovusBio [Littleton, CO]), 
or anti-B cell lymphoma 2 (bcl2, 1:5000, mouse-mAb # 
NB100-78543, NovusBio), anti-inducible nitric oxide syn-
thase (iNOS, 1:1500, rabbit-mAb # 13120, Cell signaling). 
For loading controls, anti-β-tubulin (1:2000, mouse-mAb # 
NB 120-7792, NovusBio) and anti-Lamin B1 (1:2000, rab-
bit-mAb # 13435, Cell Signaling) were used.
ADP:ATP = RLUA/(RLUC −RLUB)
After primary antibody incubation, membranes were 
washed three times in PBST for 10 min. Membranes were 
then incubated with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated 
secondary antibodies (1:1000–15,000, depending on the 
primary antibody used, Santa Cruz Biotechnology [Dal-
las, TX] and Cell Signaling], see Additional file 3: Digital 
Content: for more details) for 1 h at room temperature. 
Immunoreactivity was detected using enhanced chemilu-
minescence substrate (Super Signal West Femto; Thermo 
Scientific). Images were captured using GBOX (Chemi 
XR5; Syngene), and gels were analyzed densitometrically 
using the computerized image analysis software (Gene 
Tools from Syngene). Target protein bands were normal-
ized to loading controls β-tubulin or Lamin B1.
Measures of oxidative stress
For measurement of protein carbonyls, tissue powder 
was suspended in ice cold PBS + 0.5  mM EDTA buffer, 
mixed, and centrifuged at 4 °C. The pellet was suspended 
in ice cold PBS + 0.5 mM EDTA buffer containing a pro-
tease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Halt™), fol-
lowed by sonication on ice. Samples were centrifuged and 
10% streptozocin solution was added to the supernatant 
and incubated at room temperature to remove nucleic 
acids. Samples were then re-centrifuged, the supernatant 
was collected and used for a commercial protein car-
bonyl content assay. Five microliters of the sample were 
set aside for measurement of protein concentration using 
the BCA assay.
Protein carbonyl content was measured using the 
Protein Carbonyl Content Assay Kit (MAK094, Sigma-
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in accordance with the man-
ufacturer’s instructions. This assay is based on the 
2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) reaction. DNPH was 
added to each sample which was then vortexed and incu-
bated at room temperature. TCA was added followed by 
vortexing, incubation on ice, centrifugation at − 4 °C, and 
removal of supernatant. Acetone was added to the pellet 
which was sonicated and centrifuged. Guanidine solution 
was added and sonication repeated, after which absorb-
ance was measured at 375 nm ­(A375). Carbonyl content 
was calculated based on ­A375 and indexed to protein 
content.
Brain tissue S-nitrosylation was analyzed using a 
S-nitrosylation Western blot kit (Thermo Scientific 
# 90105) according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. Ground tissue powder was lysed in HENS buffer 
(100  mM HEPES, pH 7.8; 1  mM EDTA; 0.1  mM Neo-
cuproine; 1% SDS) followed by sonication and cen-
trifugation. The supernatant was collected, and protein 
concentrations were determined using BCA kit (Thermo 
Scientific).

Two microliters of 1  M methyl methanethiosulfonate 
(MMTS) was added to the protein sample, the sample 
was vortexed and incubated at room temperature. To 
precipitate the protein, pre-chilled acetone was added to 
the samples and incubated at − 20 °C. Samples were cen-
trifuged and the pellet was air dried, then re-suspended 
in HENS buffer. Iodo TMT labeling reagent and sodium 
ascorbate were added, then vortexed and incubated in a 
cold room overnight. Pre-chilled acetone was added to 
the samples which were incubated at − 20 °C, re-centri-
fuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min, after which the pellet was 
air dried and re-suspended in HENS buffer.
To this iodo TMT-labelled sample (50 μL) 12.5 μL of 4× 
reducing Laemmli sample buffer was added and heated 
for 5 min at 99 °C. Twenty microliters of each sample was 
loaded onto 4–20% TGX gels. Proteins were transferred 
to PVDF membrane, blocked at room temperature for 1 h 
in SuperBlock Blocking Buffer (Thermo-Fisher # 37515) 
and incubated at 4 °C overnight with anti-TMT antibody 
(1:2000, Thermo-Fisher # 90075). Membranes were washed 
three times in TBST for 10 min then incubated with anti-
mouse IgG-HRP conjugated (1:15,000) secondary anti-
body for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactivity was 
detected using enhanced chemiluminescence substrate 
(Super Signal West Femto; Thermo Scientific). Images were 
captured using GBOX (Chemi XR5; Syngene), and gels 
were analyzed densitometrically using the computerized 
image analysis software (Gene Tools from Syngene). Load-
ing controls (total protein) were stained with Ponceau S 
solution. S-nitrosylation was indexed to total protein.
RNA expression
In order to identify differences between anesthetic agents 
in the setting of inflammation that were not part of our 
primary analysis, we compared mRNA expression in 
both control and CLP rats exposed to both isoflurane and 
propofol. Results were screened by the authors for genes 
related to metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, oxida-
tive stress, and cellular protection (see Table 2).
RNA isolation and library preparation
Tissue pooling was performed as in Table 3. Total RNA 
from pooled rat brain samples was isolated using the 
RNeasy plus mini kit (Qiagen) and concentrations were 
estimated using NanoDrop (ThermoFisher Scientific, we 
used UVA Biorepository and Tissue Research Facility for 
RNA extraction). 200 ng of total RNA from each sample 
was submitted to University of Virginia Genome Analy-
sis Technology Core for mRNA Seq using Illumina Next-
Generation sequencing.
Total RNA was quantified using the Invitrogen Qubit 
3 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific) and quality was 
assessed on the Agilent Technologies 4200 TapeStation. 
Samples with RNA integrity numbers of 7.7 and above 
were used to prepare libraries using the NEBNext Ultra II 
Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina. All RNAs 
were processed at the same time using master mixes and 
validated standard operating procedures established by 
the UVA School of Medicine’s Genome Analysis and 
Technology Core. Briefly, 1 µg of total RNA was used to 
isolate mRNA using NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic 
Isolation Module, followed by fragmentation and first 
and second-strand cDNA synthesis and fragmentation as 
recommended by the manufacturer. The resulting cDNA 
was end-repaired and then adenylated, in preparation 
for the ligation of sequencing adapters. Unique barcodes 
were added to the ligation products via PCR, and the 
final purified libraries were quantified and sized using the 
Invitrogen Qubit 3 Fluorometer and Agilent TapeStation.
Next‑generation sequencing and quality control
Individually barcoded libraries were adjusted to equal 
molar concentration and pooled (16 per run) to a 4 nM 
solution, which was then denatured in 0.1 sodium hydrox-
ide, following the Illumina recommended procedure. 
Before each run, the denatured pool was diluted to 1.3 pM 
before loading on the Illumina NextSeq 75 bp High Out-
put sequencing kit reagent cartridge. Both pools were 
run sequentially on the Illumina NextSeq 500 for single-
end sequencing. After transfer to the Illumina Base Space 
interface, the quality of the runs was assessed by the num-
bers of reads in millions passing filter (540 M and 505 M, 
respectively) and the % of indexed reads (97.5%).
RNA expression analysis
Read alignments and expression read counts were per-
formed using STAR [51]. The reference genome of Rat-
tus norvegicus (Rat) version rn5 from UCSC was used for 
read assembly and mapping. The resulting read counts 
were summarized per gene and was imported into R for 
performing differential expression of genes using DESeq2 
[52]. We had 4 biological replicates, each for the CLP 
and the control group of rats in this study (though tech-
nically each one of these were pooled from 3 samples).

We analyzed the treatment (sepsis) effect on the expres-
sion of genes under each anesthetic background. We 
performed FDR (False Discovery Rate [Benjamini–Hoch-
berg]) correction of p values obtained for each gene in 
the study and identified significant genes using a FDR/
Padj threshold of less than 0.05. A list of genes was tabu-
lated that were significantly up- or down regulated in the 
CLP group of rats (compared to control/sham) for each 
anesthetic (propofol and isoflurane).
Power analysis and statistical comparisons
The primary outcome of this study was the change in 
­CytOX 8 h after celiotomy. We hypothesized that animals 
subjected to inflammation would experience significant 
reductions in ­CytOX in comparison with controls. Based 
on pilot data from our laboratory we expected ­CytOX to 
decrease by 0.014 arbitrary units (s = 0.0083) after expo-
sure to inflammation, suggesting an effect size of approx-
imately 0.6 and that two groups of 12 animals would be 
needed to reliably discriminate between groups (one-way 
ANOVA, α = 0.05, 1 − β = 0.80). Because we are interested 
in the impact of inflammation on subcellular energetics 
using both VAA and GABA agonists as anesthetic agents, 
we require four total groups of 12 animals (48 total).
All data ­(CytOX, protein expression, ADP:ATP ratio, 
measures of oxidative stress, and laboratory values) were 
tested for normality using the D’Agostino–Pearson nor-
mality test. Groups of normally distributed data (con-
trol vs. inflammation) were compared using the t-test 
(parametric) or Mann–Whitney test (non-parametric) as 
appropriate. When paired data were available (e.g. inter-
leukins), paired tests were utilized to account for inter-
individual variability. All calculations were performed in 
GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) and 
MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA).
Unless otherwise noted, parametric grouped data are 
presented as mean and 95% confidence intervals, whereas 
non-parametric grouped data are presented as median 
and interquartile range. Time series NIRS data were ana-
lyzed using a permutation F-test, performed by a biostat-
istician (TM).
