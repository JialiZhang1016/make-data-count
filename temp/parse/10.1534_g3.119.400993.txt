ABSTRACT Plants are subjected to extreme environmental conditions and must adapt rapidly. The
phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) accumulates during abiotic stress, signaling transcriptional changes that
trigger physiological responses. Epigenetic modiﬁcations often facilitate transcription, particularly at genes
exhibiting temporal, tissue-speciﬁc and environmentally-induced expression. In maize (Zea mays), MEDIA-
TOR OF PARAMUTATION 1 (MOP1) is required for progression of an RNA-dependent epigenetic pathway
that regulates transcriptional silencing of loci genomewide. MOP1 function has been previously correlated
with genomic regions adjoining particular types of transposable elements and genic regions, suggesting that
this regulatory pathway functions to maintain distinct transcriptional activities within genomic spaces, and
that loss of MOP1 may modify the responsiveness of some loci to other regulatory pathways. As critical
regulators of gene expression, MOP1 and ABA pathways each regulate speciﬁc genes. To determine whether
loss of MOP1 impacts ABA-responsive gene expression in maize, mop1-1 and Mop1 homozygous seedlings
were subjected to exogenous ABA and RNA-sequencing. A total of 3,242 differentially expressed genes
(DEGs) were identiﬁed in four pairwise comparisons. Overall, ABA-induced changes in gene expression were
enhanced in mop1-1 homozygous plants. The highest number of DEGs were identiﬁed in ABA-induced
mop1-1 mutants, including many transcription factors; this suggests combinatorial regulatory scenarios in-
cluding direct and indirect transcriptional responses to genetic disruption (mop1-1) and/or stimulus-induction of
a hierarchical, cascading network of responsive genes. Additionally, a modest increase in CHH methylation at
putative MOP1-RdDM loci in response to ABA was observed in some genotypes, suggesting that epigenetic
variation might inﬂuence environmentally-induced transcriptional responses in maize.

As sessile organisms, plants must adapt rapidly to ﬂuctuating and
often extreme abiotic stress conditions that negatively impact crop
productivity and yield, such as water deprivation/drought, high
salinity, nutrient deﬁciency and extreme temperatures. In addition
to its role in plant development, the phytohormone abscisic acid
(ABA) serves as a critical regulator of plant responses to speciﬁc
abiotic stresses. ABA responses to environmental stress stimuli result in
physiological changes primarily directed to minimize water loss, such as
stomatal closure and growth inhibition (reviewed by Fujita et al. 2011;
Sah et al. 2016; Kuromori et al. 2018).
The signaling events and molecular mechanisms of ABA-mediated
responses have been extensively characterized in the model plant
Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis). Brieﬂy, under speciﬁc abiotic
stress, ABA binds to a PYRABACTIN RESISTANCE (PYR)/PYR1-LIKE
(PYL)/REGULATORY COMPONENT OF ABA RECEPTOR (RCAR)
(PYR/PYL/RCAR) receptor complex which inactivates the negative
signaling PHOSPHATASE TYPE 2C (PP2C) protein. Receptor binding
by ABA and inactivation of PP2C in turn allows for the positive regulator

SNF1-RELATED PROTEIN KINASE 2 (SnRK2) to phosphorylate and
activate ABSCISIC ACID RESPONSIVE ELEMENT BINDING
PROTEIN/BINDING FACTOR (AREB/ABF) transcription factors
(TFs) (reviewed by Mehrotra et al. 2014). ABA-induced transcrip-
tion factors regulate many primary target genes by recognizing and
binding to speciﬁc ABA-responsive cis-elements in their promoters.
The promoters of ABA-responsive genes are expected to contain
two or more copies of a sequence known as an ABA-Responsive
Element (ABRE) (Marcotte et al. 1989) or one ABRE that works
in conjunction with a Coupling Element (CE) (Shen and Ho 1995;
Shen et al. 1996) that function as TF binding sites. TFs that contain
these regulatory elements can be transcriptionally induced by ABA
and trigger the regulation of primary or secondary ABA target genes.
Therefore, transcription factor activation, promoter recognition,
and DNA-binding activities are critical downstream ABA-mediated
physiological responses to abiotic stress.
Transcription factor families that mediate plant responses to abiotic
stresses include the APETALA2/ethylene-responsive element-binding
proteins (AP2/EREBPs), basic leucine zipper (bZIP), Myeloblastosis
(MYB), WRKY and No apical meristem, ATAF1 and CUC cup-shaped
cotyledon (NAC) proteins (reviewed by Hoang et al. 2017). In several
documented examples, transgenic plants overexpressing these regula-
tory proteins exhibit increased stress tolerance phenotypes (reviewed
by Fujita et al. 2011; Todaka et al. 2015; Joshi et al. 2016; Hoang et al.
2017), demonstrating the utility of manipulating regulatory factors
to increase agricultural productivity under extreme environmental
conditions.
Transcription factor binding and transcriptional activation of
some abiotic stress-responsive genes relies on alterations to chroma-
tin structure and epigenetic modiﬁcations. The relationship between
transcription and chromatin remodeling in response to abiotic stress
and ABA signaling has recently begun to be appreciated (reviewed
by Mehrotra et al. 2014; Kim et al. 2015; Asensi-Fabado et al. 2017;
Lämke and Bäurle 2017).
In plants, RNA-dependent DNA methylation (RdDM) is a
speciﬁc transcriptional gene-silencing pathway that functions to
direct changes in epigenetic modiﬁcations and gene expression at
target loci (reviewed by Matzke et al. 2015). The RdDM pathway is
reliant on the biogenesis of and response to small non-coding RNAs
(sRNAs) through the activity of several proteins, which include two
plant-speciﬁc DNA-dependent RNA polymerases (Pol IV and Pol V),
an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR), a Dicer-like protein, an
Argonaute-complex, DNA modifying enzymes to induce cytosine
methylation, ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, and
other accessory proteins (Matzke and Mosher 2014).
In maize, MEDIATOR OF PARAMUTATION 1 (MOP1), an
ortholog of the Arabidopsis RDR2 (Dorweiler et al. 2000; Alleman
et al. 2006), interacts with Pol IV (Haag et al. 2014) and is required for
Pol IV-dependent sRNA biogenesis and progression of the RdDM
pathway. A Pol IV-MOP1-dependent pathway maintains chromatin
boundaries between protein-coding genes and gene-proximal trans-
posable elements (Li et al. 2015a). The mop1-1 mutation results in a
reduction of 24-nt siRNAs and a loss in DNA methylation at certain
loci, particularly in the CHH context (Lisch et al. 2002; Woodhouse
et al. 2006; Nobuta et al. 2008; Jia et al. 2009; Li et al. 2014); this
mutant stock has proven to be a valuable genetic resource and has
been used extensively to characterize Pol IV-mediated RdDM activ-
ities across the maize genome (Nobuta et al. 2008; Jia et al. 2009; Gent
et al. 2014; Li et al. 2014; Madzima et al. 2014; Li et al. 2015a).
Nonetheless, the identiﬁcation of MOP1 and RdDM targets is not a
straight-forward task, because multiple factors contribute to MOP1
target speciﬁcity and loss of gene silencing, which initiates a cascade
of transcriptional and epigenetic changes that complicate the distinc-
tion between MOP1 direct and indirect targets.
Cytosine DNA methylation is important in many biological
processes including regulation of transposon silencing and expression
of endogenous genes, plant development, and environmental-stress
responses (Zhang et al. 2018). In plants, this conserved epigenetic mark
occurs in symmetric (CG, CHG) and asymmetric contexts (CHH); in
which H can be A,T, or C) (Henderson and Jacobsen 2007). CG and
CHG methylation is maintained throughout DNA replication by
METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 (MET1) and CHROMOMETHYLASE 3
(CMT3) respectively (Niederhuth and Schmitz 2017). Asymmetric meth-
ylation can be established by DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLASE
1/2 (DRM1/2) through the RdDM pathway (Law and Jacobsen
2010).
The majority of the maize genome is composed of transposons
(Schnable et al. 2009), which are mostly methylated in a symmetrical
context (West et al. 2014). On a genome-wide scale, methylated CHH
sites are observed at signiﬁcantly lower levels than methylated CG and
CHG sites, however, regions of elevated CHH methylation are observed
upstream of the transcription start sites of genes (Gent et al. 2013).
These RdDM-dependent CHH methylation sites coincide with the
presence of speciﬁc classes of transposons found within 1 kb of many
maize genes (Gent et al. 2013; Regulski et al. 2013; Li et al. 2015a).
In Arabidopsis, four glycosylases have been characterized as
functioning in active DNA demethylation by initiating removal
of methylated cytosines from DNA via base excision repair: RE-
PRESSOR OF SILENCING 1 (ROS1), DEMETER (DME), DME-like
2 (DML2) and DML3 (Choi et al. 2002; Agius et al. 2006; Gehring
et al. 2006; Morales-Ruiz et al. 2006; Penterman et al. 2007). ROS1
has been shown to act through an auto-regulatory, coordinated
RdDM-demethylation based response (Lei et al. 2015; Williams
et al. 2015). At some loci, maintenance of transcription appears to
be dependent on RdDM activity, which challenges the canonical
model of RdDM-mediated transcriptional repression. ROS1 was
also recently shown to be required for transcriptional activation of
speciﬁc ABA-inducible genes in Arabidopsis (Kim et al. 2019). The
maize DNG103 is highly similar to Arabidopsis ROS1. As reported
with Ros1 in Arabidopsis RdDM mutants (Huettel et al. 2006;
Li et al. 2012), Dng103 is downregulated in maize RdDM mutants
(Jia et al. 2009; Madzima et al. 2014; Erhard et al. 2015; Williams
et al. 2015). Transcriptional repression of Dng103 in mop1-1
mutants likely induces other expression changes that cannot be
directly attributed to loss of MOP1 activity.
Plant responses to abiotic stress are multifaceted, integrating mul-
tiple environmental cues and biological response mechanisms. These
complex mechanisms must be understood to maximize stress tolerance
in plants. As both MOP1 and ABA signaling networks act as key
regulators of gene expression, characterizing these responses and iden-
tifying overlap between the two processes will provide a wealth of
information about the mechanisms of stress response in crop plants
and candidate pathways to enhance stress response under different
agricultural conditions. In this study, we use RNA- and sequence-capture
bisulﬁte sequencing of ABA-induced mop1-1 mutant and wildtype
Mop1 seedlings to identify MOP1-dependent, ABA-induced genes.

conditions (16 h light period, 25, 50% humidity) until they reached
the V3 stage (RNA-seq) or ten-day old seedlings (methylation). The
mop1-1 mutation was from genetic stocks from J. Dorweiler of the
mop1-1 mutation introgressed into the B73 reference genome and
backcrossed for seven generations (Madzima et al. 2014). For this
study, progeny resulting from the self-pollination of an ear of a
heterozygous plant was used. Only homozygous wildtype and ho-
mozygous mutant siblings were used.
Plant genotyping
The Mop1/mop1-1 segregating family was genotyped under the
following PCR conditions: 94 for 5 min (1x; 95 for 30 s, 56
for 45 s, 72 for 45 s (30x); 72 for 10 min (1x); hold for 4 (as needed);
using the following primers as previously described (Madzima,
Huang, & Mcginnis 2014):
KM384: (59-TCTCCACCGCCCACTTGAT-39);
KM385: (59-CCCAAGAGCT GTCTCGTATCCGT-39);
KM386: (59 -CTTCATCTCGAAGTAGCGCTTGTTGTCC-39).
Abscisic acid treatment in seedlings
ABA concentrations used in maize seedling studies range from 1 to
150 mM, and 50 mM is commonly used in stage V3 seedlings
(2 weeks old) (Fan et al. 2016; Phillips and Ludidi 2017; Belda-
Palazon et al. 2018; He et al. 2018; Wang et al. 2018; He et al. 2019).
Maize seedlings at the V3 stage were removed from the soil, roots
were rinsed in water, dried, and then submerged in a 1 L beaker with
250 mL of liquid Murashige and Skoog (MS) media (Sigma Aldrich,
M6899) with 50 mM ABA (ABA; (Sigma Aldrich, (+/2) Abscisic
Acid, A1049)) or without ABA (MS) for 7 and 8 hr (methylation and
RNA-seq, respectively) in greenhouse conditions (16 h light period,
25, 50% humidity). After the incubation period, roots where
removed and seedlings were immediately ﬂash frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at -80 until use. Homozygous wildtype (Mop1
WT) and homozygous mop1 mutant (mop1-1) individuals were
used.
Total RNA isolation
Frozen seedling tissue was ﬁnely ground into powder in liquid
nitrogen and homogenized before total RNA extraction was per-
formed using TRI reagent according to manufacturer’s instructions
(Molecular Research Center, 18080-051). RNA samples were DNase
treated (RQ1 RNase-Free DNase, Promega, M6101) and puriﬁed
using RNA clean & concentrator 25 (Zymo Research, R1018). The
integrity and quality of the total RNA was checked by a NanoDrop
1000 spectrophotometer and by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis.
RNA library preparation, RNA-sequencing and
read alignment
Three biological replicates were used for all RNA-seq experiments for
each treatment and genotype, for a total of 12 samples. The ﬁnal
sample concentration was quantiﬁed by Qubit. RNA library prepa-
ration (NEBNext Ultra II kit, NEB, E7760) and Illumina paired-end
150 bp (PE 150) sequencing were performed by Novogene Corpo-
ration (Sacramento, California). More than 20 million reads were
obtained per library, FASTQ adapters were trimmed by Cutadapt
1.8.1 (Martin 2011) and quality control was performed using
FASTQC v0.11.2 (bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/).
Reads were mapped to the B73 maize genome (AGP B73v4) (Jiao
et al. 2017) by HISAT2 v2.04 (Pertea et al. 2016). Transcripts were
assembled de novo to allow for inclusion of transcripts that are not
included in the reference genome annotation and quantiﬁed using
StringTie v1.3.4d (Pertea et al. 2016). Gene count matrices were
generated from this data using the prepDE.py python script avail-
able in the StringTie website (http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie/
index.shtml?t=manual). These matrices were used by the Biocon-
ductor package edgeR 3.20.9 (Chen et al. 2016) in R for differential
expression analysis in order to identify upregulated and downregu-
lated genes for the four different genotypes under two treatments.
Low-abundance counts of , 0.58 cpm were removed using the
DESeq2 ﬁltering method (statquest.org/2017/05/16/statquest-ﬁltering-
genes-with-low-read-counts/); (Love et al. 2014) incorporated into
the edgeR pipeline, and genes with an adjusted p-value of # 0.05
and an absolute log2 fold change (FC) value of $ 0.95 were considered
as differentially expressed for both upregulated and downregulated
genes.
Reverse Transcription Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)
analysis of transcript abundance
Reverse Transcription Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed
for all 12 RNA samples to conﬁrm an induction of ABA treatment by
measuring the expression of Responsive to ABA 17 (Rab17) (Vilardell
et al. 1990) in maize seedlings. The well characterized ABA and
stress-responsive maize gene Viviparous1 (Vp1) (Cao et al. 2007)
was used as a negative control, since it is only ABA-responsive in
maize embryos, and Ubiquitin conjugase was used as a control. Rab17
qPCR primers KM1634 (59-TCCTTGATTCCCTTCTTCCTC-39) and
KM1635 (59-GAGGGAGGAGCACAAGACC-39), Vp1 qPCR primers
KM1465 (59- CCGATGTCAAGTCGGGCAAATATC-39) and KM1466
(59-TGGAACCACTGCCTTGCTCTTG-39), and Ubiquitin conjugase
KM633 (59- GACTACACGATGGAGAACATCCTAACCC-39) and
KM634 (59- GAAGAATGTCCCTTCTGGAGGCTGC-39) were used.
RT-qPCR was performed for 11 of the 12 RNA samples (ex-
cluding a wild type control that had atypical expression patterns and
was therefore excluded as an outlier) to measure gene expression
of Dng101 (Zm000010a020199), Dng103 (Zm00001d038302), and
Dng105 (Zm00001d016521). The following qPCR primers were
used for Dng101, KM1656 (59-CTTCTGCTCTTGCTGCTCCA-39)
and KM1657 (59-CGACTGAAGAGATA CAACGATGC-39), Dng103
KM1467 (59- ACCATGCTGTGACCCTCAAATGG-39) and KM1468
(59- CATAGCTGTTCGACAAGGAACCAG-39), and Dng105 KM1658
(59-GGCAAGATATACAGGAATGCTTGA-39) and KM1659 (59- C-
GATGTCCTAGTCCGCTTCA -39). Ubiquitin conjugase was used as a
control ampliﬁed by primers KM63 59- GACTACACGATGGAGAA-
CATCCTAACCC-39) and KM634 (59- GAAGAATGTCCCTTCTGG-
AGGCTGC-39).
First-strand cDNA synthesis and RT-qPCR were performed
by Florida State University’s Biology Molecular Core Facility.
First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed by reverse transcribing
1 mg of total RNA with Oligo(dT)20 primers according to manufac-
turer’s instructions (SuperScriptTM III Reverse Transcriptase, Invitro-
gen, 18080-051). Reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)
was performed using an Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR
System and SYBR Green reagents (Thermoﬁsher Scientiﬁc). The
generation of speciﬁc PCR products was conﬁrmed by melting curve
analysis. Primers were designed using MaizeGDB (maizegdb.org) and
Net Primer Analysis Software (premierbiosoft.com/netprimer/).

protocol. Sequence capture library construction used 0.5-1 mg of genomic
DNA as previously described by (Li et al. 2015b). Adapters were trimmed
using Trim Galore! (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/
projects/trim_galore/). Reads were aligned to maize genome version
4 (AGPv4) using BSMAP-2.90 (-v 5 -q 20) (Xi & Li 2009) and
uniquely mapped reads were processed as described previously (Han
et al. 2018) The unmethylated chloroplast genome was used to
determine cytosine conversion rate. The methylation ratio (number
of reads that were methylated and unmethylated) was determined for
each methylation context by the weighted DNA methylation method
(#C / (#C + #T)) using BSMAP tools. BEDTools and overlapping
reads were used to determine read coverage for target regions.
Genome-wide methylation changes were determined by assessing
regions with a minimum of 5x coverage and 2 methylation sites,
and methylation levels of 10% for CG and CHG contexts and 1%
for the CHH context. Methylation % difference was calculated by
the equation: ((Genotype/Treatment 1 mC% - Genotype/Treatment
2 mC%) / (Genotype/Treatment 2)).
Promoter regions of DEGs were deﬁned as the 2 kb region upstream
from the transcription start site. This 2000 bp region was divided into
100 bp tiles for further methylation analysis. Tiles with no data were
removed and not counted for the ﬁnal average mC level. Coverage was
calculated using DNA methylation data in 100 bp tiles. Methylation
percentage was deﬁned as [treatment – control] x100. For average
methylation % in the promoter region of DEGs, a minimum of 2x
coverage, 2 methylation sites, 10% methylation for CG/CHG and 1%
for CHH was used.
Pairwise comparisons for Mop1 wildtype ABA vs. Mop1 wildtype
MS (Figure 6, comparison A) and mop1-1 mutant MS vs. Mop1
wildtype MS (Figure 6, comparison D) were correlated with genes in
Group I and II, and Groups III, IV, V and VI from RNA-Seq results,
respectively. Differentially methylated promoters were identiﬁed
by comparisons where there was an absolute methylation differ-
ence (Genotype/Treatment 1 mC% - Genotype/Treatment mC 2%)
of $ 40% in the CG/CHG context; in the CHH context where one
Genotype/Treatment sample showed a methylation level of # 5%
and between comparisons a methylation % difference higher
than $15%. A region with $10% methylation increase in the
CG context was deﬁned as having CG hypermethylation.
Gene ontology analysis
Gene ontology (GO) (Plant GO Slim) analysis was conducted using
the web-based tool agriGO v2.0 (Tian et al. 2017), incorporating
AGOv4 IDs into a Single Enrichment Analysis (SEA) using the
Fisher’s statistical test, Hochberg (FDR) multi-test adjustment
method with a signiﬁcance level of , 0.05 and minimum number
of mapping entries of 10 genes per GO-term. The GO term enrich-
ment was generated by hierarchically clustering the log10 of the total
GO term percentage of a set of genes that were upregulated or
downregulated in wildtype or mutant in response to ABA (Table S4).
Alignment and overlap of 24 nt siRNA and promoter
proximal regions of DEGs
Using publicly available data from NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus
(GEO, GSE68510; (Wang et al. 2017)) from (Mop1/mop1-1) wildtype
and mutant (mop1-1/mop1-1) maize young cob small RNA raw reads
were processed for 24-nt siRNA alignment and comparison. The
TruSeq Small RNA 39 adapter (RA3) sequences were removed from
the raw reads using Cutadapt (Martin 2011) and quality of the reads
was assessed before and after the trimming using FASTQC v0.11.2
(bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). Alignment of the
reads was performed by ShortStack v3 (Johnson et al. 2016) using
default parameters. Using the (.bam) alignment ﬁles generated by
ShortStack v3 and the chromosomal location of the 2 kb region
upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) (downloaded using
biomart ensembl plants) (ShortStack speciﬁed parameter:–loci) of all
protein coding genes in Zea mays (B73 RefGen_v4), the promoter
proximal regions of these genes were assessed for the presence of 24 nt
siRNAs. Differential 24 nt siRNA targeting between Mop1 wildtype
and mop1-1 mutant in this 2 Kb region upstream of TSS was
calculated with edgeR 3.20.9 (Robinson et al. 2010; Mccarthy et al.
2012) after removal of low-abundance regions and library normal-
ization. Further normalization was performed to the foldchange of
2.2 (log2 of 1.13), calculated using the abundances of the undis-
turbed expression of high-conﬁdence maize miRNAs from miRbase
(http://www.mirbase.org/cgi-bin/mirna_summary.pl?org=zma; B73_
RefGen_v4) in the mutant and wildtype (miRNA abundances in
mop1-1 mutant/miRNA abundances in Mop1 wildtype; Table S4,
File S6).
ABA-response transcription factor network
Based on the Arabidopsis ABA-responsive transcription factor hier-
archical network built using chromatin immunoprecipitated (ChIP)
data (Song et al. 2016) maize orthologs for the genes present in the
network were identiﬁed using a list generated by blasting maize
proteins against TAIR 10 protein sequences using standalone
BLASTP version 2.2.28+ 581 (Camacho et al. 2009) (File S3). Gene
targets for transcription factors located in every level or tier were
predicted using a tissue-speciﬁc gene regulatory network in seed, SAM,
root and leaf maize tissues (https://www.bio.fsu.edu/mcginnislab/
mgrn/) (Huang et al. 2018) and were represented as edges. Nodes
represent the log2FC of these genes in our dataset (Figure S5).
Motif discovery and enrichment analysis
The Multiple Expectation Maximization (EM) for Motif Elicitation
(MEME) tool (http://meme-suite.org) version 5.0.4 was used to
search for the presence of any conserved domains among the
ABA-response transcription factor network built from our dataset.
The promoter sequences of 47 genes were used with the following
parameters: -dna -mod anr -revcomp -minw 5 -maxw 10 -nmotifs
10 -evt 0.05. A motif highly similar to the maize ABRE was found in
66% of these genes. Find Individual Motif Occurrences (FIMO)
version 5.0.5 was used to identify ABA-responsive genes in other
sets of DEGs. Motif enrichment was performed using the previously-
found putative ABRE motif (CACG[TC]G[TG]C[GC]) as input.
Primary ABA targets were deﬁned as genes that were differentially
expressed in response to ABA and that contained at least two ABRE
sites in their promoter or one ABRE site and a coupling element (CE).
Transposable element enrichment analysis
Bedtools ‘closest’ tool was used to identify enriched TEs adjacent to
the 2 kb upstream or 2 kb downstream DNA region of DEGs from
groups V and VI (File S10). Gene annotations from the differentially
expressed genes of interest were extracted from the B73 Refgen_v4
genome assembly (Jiao Et Al., 2017) using EnsemblPlants BioMart
(plants.ensembl.org/biomart/) (Kinsella et al. 2011). The transposable
element (TE) annotation ﬁle used was downloaded from github
(B73.structuralTEv2.2018.12.20.ﬁlteredTE.gff3.gz; https://github.com/
SNAnderson/maizeTE_variation). The percentage distribution of
transposable element families in the B73 genome was calculated using
from data from previously published studies (Anderson et al. 2019).

RESULTS
Canonical abiotic stress associated genes are
transcriptionally responsive to ABA in wildtype and
mop1-1 maize seedlings
To determine the combined effects of MOP1 and ABA on gene
expression in maize, homozygous wildtype (Mop1) and mutant
(mop1-1) individuals from a segregating family of seedlings at
vegetative stage 3 (V3) from a self-pollinated Mop1/mop1-1 ear were
subjected to treatment with ABA. Induction was conﬁrmed by
measuring the expression of the Responsive to ABA 17 (Rab17) gene
(Figure S1), which encodes a putative dehydrin protein and has been
the subject of study for ABA- and osmotic stress-responsiveness.
Upregulation of Rab17 expression is well-documented in several
transcriptomic studies measuring responses to ABA and drought
in maize embryos (Vilardell et al. 1990; Goday et al. 1994) and
vegetative tissues (Vilardell et al. 1994; Busk and Pages 1998; Zheng
et al. 2004) as well as in drought studies in sorghum leaves at the
seedling stage (Johnson et al. 2014). Reverse transcription and
quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) of Rab17 conﬁrmed that the ABA-
treatment of V3 seedlings was sufﬁcient to induce changes in gene
expression (Figure S1).
RNA from these ABA-induced and control genotypes was sub-
jected to cDNA library preparation, RNA-sequencing and transcrip-
tome analysis. An average of 23 million 150 bp paired end raw reads
were obtained per sample and mapped to the B73 reference genome
(AGP B73v4) (Jiao et al. 2017). Mapped reads were used in sub-
sequent analysis (Table 1). Multidimensional scaling (MDS) was
performed to determine the relationship between genotype and
treatment for the 12 homozygous Mop1 and mop1-1 samples, with
the majority clustering according to genotype and treatment
(Figure S2). One biological replicate of a Mop1 wildtype sample that
was not treated with ABA clustered with the wildtype ABA-treated
samples. This suggests non-experimental endogenous induction of
ABA in this seedling, perhaps related to a stress response induced in
this individual under control treatment conditions. Due to evidence
of an ABA-induced response, this sample was removed from further
analysis and only two replicates for the wildtype control were used.
The removal of wt_m1_ms_3 did not affect the proportion of
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) found in mop1-1 mutant in
response to ABA when compared to Mop1 wildtype (Table S1).
Signiﬁcant DEGs were identiﬁed in four pairwise comparisons as
genes with a twofold expression change (log2 FC $ 0.95, FDR , 0.05)
(Table 2). The DEGs in the four comparisons were further sub-
divided into eight analysis groups based on gene expression patterns
identiﬁed by making direct comparisons between genotypes and
treatments (Table 2; File S1). For example, by comparing expression
in wildtype plants in the presence and absence of ABA treatment,
ABA-induced (Group I) and ABA-repressed (Group II) genes were
detected. The total number of DEGs identiﬁed in all eight groups was
3,242 genes; however, 1,681 genes were found to be common to more
than one analysis group, resulting in 1,561 DEGs unique to an
individual analysis group (Table 2). Analysis of the individual groups
of unique DEGs revealed relationships between ABA-responsiveness
and MOP1-mediated effects on transcriptional regulation in maize
(Figure 1).
In summary, several well-documented, abiotic-stress-associated
responses were found to be ABA responsive in wildtype and mop1-1
plants (Groups I and V; File S1). In addition to Rab17, notable
examples include twelve of the twenty maize Protein Phosphatase
2C-like class, group A (PP2C-A) genes (Table S2) that are known to act
as negative regulators of ABA signaling in Arabidopsis and other
plant species (reviewed by Mehrotra et al. 2014).
Many of the DEGs identiﬁed in untreated mop1-1 mutants relative
to untreated Mop1 wildtype (Groups III and IV) are comparable to
published mop1-1 expression datasets (Jia et al. 2009; Madzima et al.
2014) in spite of tissue-speciﬁc expression differences that likely exist
between these studies. The maize Dng103 (Zm00001d038302) gene,
an ortholog of the Arabidopsis DNA glycosylase gene Repressor of
silencing1 (Ros1) (Morales-Ruiz et al. 2006), has been shown to be
downregulated in mop1-1 shoot apical meristems (SAMs) (Jia et al.
2009), immature ears (Madzima et al. 2014), and leaves (Williams
et al. 2015). Based on our expression criteria for DEGs, Dng103 did
not appear in Group IV as was expected, however, downregulation of
Dng103 in mop1-1 seedlings was conﬁrmed by RT-qPCR (Figure S3).
Interestingly, Dng103 expression was highly variable across biological
replicates, and the gene appears to be upregulated in response to
exogenous ABA application in wildtype but not mop1-1 plants
(Figure S3).
Genes identiﬁed in Groups I and II (ABA-responsive in WT) and
Groups III and IV (MOP1-dependent) are similar to previously
reported transcriptomic studies of ABA in Arabidopsis (Seki et al.
2002; Matsui et al. 2008; Liu et al. 2018) and MOP1 in maize (Jia et al.
2009; Madzima et al. 2014)]. Therefore, we focus herein on the novel
ﬁndings of their combined regulation, identiﬁed predominantly
through analysis of Groups V-VIII DEGs (Table 2).
Loss of MOP1 ampliﬁes ABA transcriptional responses in
maize seedlings
The largest numbers of DEGs from all eight analysis groups were
observed in Groups V and VI (representing 60% of all DEGs), which

were identiﬁed by comparing expression in mop1-1 mutants exposed
to exogenous ABA relative to untreated mutant siblings. Groups V
and VI include 965 and 994 up- and downregulated genes, respec-
tively (Table 2). Of the 1959 DEGs, one-third of these (658 genes)
were also differentially expressed in wildtype plants in response to
exogenous ABA (Groups I and II) (Figure 1A), suggesting that these
are ABA-dependent genes. When comparing the magnitude of effect
of ABA exposure on gene expression, both genotypes exhibit a similar
average and distribution of fold-change in response to ABA treatment
(Groups I, II, V, and VI; Figure 1B). However, a much larger number of
genes meet the signiﬁcance and fold-change thresholds established for
these analysis groups in mop1-1 homozygous plants compared to
wildtype. This results in 2x more upregulated genes and 3x more
downregulated genes in mop1-1 mutant plants when compared to Mop1
wildtype plants (Table 2), suggesting that the loss of MOP1 ampliﬁes
genome-wide ABA-induced changes in gene expression in maize.
In the absence of MOP1, ABA induces differential
expression of a unique subset of genes and distinct
functional categories
A direct comparison of the ABA response in homozygous mop1-1
plants vs. wildtype allows for the identiﬁcation of 252 genes that are
differentially expressed between these two genotypes in the presence
of exogenous ABA (Groups VII and VIII; Table 2). Speciﬁcally, there
were 194 up- and 58 downregulated DEGs in ABA-treated mop1-1
compared to wildtype. Of these 252 genes, 128 were also included in
Groups III and IV (Figure 1A), indicating that these genes were
differentially expressed in mop1-1 homozygous plants in a similar
manner with or without ABA treatment.
Of the 252 genes, one third (88 genes) were uniquely differentially
expressed in these groups and not detected by other comparisons.
These 88 genes would not have been identiﬁed as differentially
expressed if gene expression had not been analyzed in the absence
of MOP1 and the presence of ABA simultaneously. Genes in this
category include speciﬁc members of the abiotic stress-responsive
LATE EMBRYOGENESIS ABUNDANT (LEA), dehydrins, Gluco-
syltransferase/Rab-like GTPase activator/Myotubularin (GRAM) and
VQ gene families that were uniquely upregulated in response to ABA
in mop1-1 mutants (Table 3). The unique expression patterns of genes
with predicted physiological and developmental roles suggests that
plants experiencing a loss of MOP1 together with the induction of
ABA responses may have biological consequences. To explore this
further, the identity and predicted function of DEGs across the
different analysis groups were characterized.
Gene ontology (GO) analysis was used to predict the biological
processes (BP) of annotated genes in each of the 8 analysis groups.
Only genes from Groups I, II, V, and VI met the enrichment criteria
for GO analysis (see Methods). More than 85% of the genes were
annotated in these groups, resulting in 17 GO terms for Group I,
11 for Group II, 22 for Group V and 28 for Group VI (Table S4).

Consistent with response to ABA induction, the most prevalent
GO term present across all four groups was ‘response to stimulus’
(GO:0050896; FDR # 7E-05; File S2). Noteably, Group VI genes, which
are downregulated in the mop1-1 homozygous seedlings treated with
ABA, were enriched with unique diverse GO terms such as growth,
development, and reproduction, when compared to the other three groups
(FDR # 0.049; Figure 2). The enrichment of development-related genes
that are differentially expressed between mutants and wildtype may be
related to the pleiotropic developmental defective phenotypes observed in
mop1-1 and the many genes mis-regulated as a consequence of the loss of
MOP1 activity (Dorweiler et al. 2000; Jia et al. 2009; Madzima et al. 2014).
Hierarchically organized transcription factors are
uniquely differentially expressed in response to ABA in
the mop1-1 genotype
The ampliﬁed response to ABA observed in the mop1-1 homozygous
plants might be due to the combined consequences of direct and
indirect effects. MOP1 and ABA treatment might each directly induce
a subset of transcriptional changes that in turn activate a cascade of
additional responses in maize. Transcription factors (TFs) are key
regulators of the transcriptional activity of genes involved in networks
that are fundamental for plant growth and development, as well as
responses to stress stimuli, and might therefore induce secondary
effects in such a cascade.
In response to ABA, a total of 90 transcription factors were
induced in both the Mop1 and mop1-1 genotypes, or unique to
one genotype (Table 4), including genes corresponding to the Zinc-
ﬁnger (ZF), APETALA2/Ethylene-Responsive Element Binding Pro-
tein (AP2/EREBP), Basic Leucine Zipper (bZIP), Myeloblastosis
(MYB), Homeobox (HB), and Heat Shock Factor (HSFTF) families
of TFs (Table 4). For example, the AP2/EREBP superfamily is one of
the largest known to play a critical role in abiotic stress responses in
plants (Mizoi et al. 2012). Of the AP2/EREBP TFs identiﬁed in this
study, most are upregulated in response to ABA (Table 4). Of these
90 TFs, 32 were found to be upregulated in response to ABA in both
mutant and wildtype genotypes, whereas 51 TFs were upregulated in
response to ABA only in mop1-1 (Table 4). Other members of the same
families of TFs were identiﬁed as downregulated in response to ABA
treatment (72 TFs, Table 5). The majority of these (50 genes) were
uniquely downregulated in the mop1-1 mutant (Table 5), presumably
through negative regulation directed by ABA-responsive and MOP1-
silenced TFs. Another noteable observation from this analysis was that
members of the NAC family of TFs, known to be responsive to ABA
and dehydration (Nakashima et al. 2009), were exclusively differentially
expressed in response to ABA in the mop1-1 mutant (Tables 4 and 5).
A recent analysis of transcriptional responses to ABA and TF binding
events in Arabidopsis suggests a hierarchical model of regulation, with
three tiers of TFs and a set of target genes thought to directly impact
physiological responses (Song et al. 2016). An implication of this model
would be that a higher tier TF might induce a substantial cascade of
effects by modulating expression of many genes in downstream tiers.
To see if this hierarchical model could be adapted to MOP1- and
ABA-mediated transcriptional responses, maize genes homologous to
the TFs in the Song et al. (2016) model were identiﬁed in Mop1 and
mop1-1 up- and downregulated genes using a list of maize orthologs of
Arabidopsis genes generated in an earlier study (Huang et al. 2017)
(File S3). Of the ten Tier 1 TF families in the Arabidopsis study, six were
represented in our maize seedling dataset with one or more homologous
genes (| log2 FC | $ 0.8, FDR , 0.05; File S3). Three of the six Tier 2 TFs
and two of the ﬁve Tier 3 TFs had one or more homologs that were
differentially expressed in maize seedlings exposed to ABA (| log2 FC |
$ 0.91, FDR , 0.05; File S3). A total of 30 maize genes were identiﬁed as
differentially expressed in maize seedlings and shared homology with
the target genes identiﬁed by the hierarchical model (| log2 FC | $ 0.75,
FDR , 0.05; File S3). A previously constructed gene regulatory network
(GRN) (Huang et al. 2018) was used to predict the regulatory rela-
tionships between these maize genes in seed, shoot apical meristem,
root, and leaf tissues (File S4). The connectivity of this network supports
the idea that these genes are part of a regulatory network (Figure 3), and
the gene expression responses observed in this study may result from
several scenarios ranging from primary and secondary transcriptional
responses to disruption or stimulus in a hierarchical network.
Mop1 wildtype plants exhibit context-dependent ABA-
induced cytosine methylation at speciﬁc loci, including
particular families of transposons
The canonical model for MOP1-activity is based on a predicted role
for MOP1 in RdDM-mediated gene silencing in which mop1-1

homozygous plants display a (1) reduction in 24-nt siRNAs (Nobuta
et al. 2008; Gent et al. 2014) and (2) reduced CHH methylation (Gent
et al. 2014; Li et al. 2014).
To proﬁle MOP1-dependent 24-nt siRNAs, we used publicly
available datasets (Wang et al. 2017) to determine if upregulated
genes were more likely to have hallmarks of direct regulation by MOP1
than downregulated genes. Genes that are differentially expressed
in response to ABA in wildtype but not mop1-1 homozygous plants
might be examples of regulatory events that are ABA-responsive and
MOP1-dependent. Two hundred (200) genes are uniquely differen-
tially expressed in wildtype in response to ABA. These 200 genes
include 105 upregulated and 95 downregulated ABA-responsive genes
in Mop1 wildtype that are not detected as differentially expressed in
ABA-induced mop1-1 mutants; identiﬁed from a comparison of
Groups I and II vs. Groups V and VI (Figure 1A). Eighty-six percent
(86%; 171 genes) of the MOP1-dependent ABA-responsive genes had a
known gene identiﬁer. Of these 171 genes, 26.08% (24/92 upregulated
genes, Group I) and 26.58% (21/79 downregulated genes, Group II)
showed a depletion of MOP1-dependent 24-nt siRNAs in their
promoter regions in the mop1-1 mutant when compared to Mop1
wildtype, respectively (Table 6). Although potentially limited by
tissue-speciﬁc differences between the siRNA datasets and expression
analysis in this study, there was no apparent relationship between
MOP1-dependent siRNAs and upregulation in mop1-1 mutants.
To proﬁle cytosine methylation changes, Mop1 wildtype and
mop1-1 mutant seedlings subjected to ABA treatment or MS control
were also used in a sequence-capture bisulﬁte sequencing approach
(Li et al. 2014). This experiment allowed us to survey ABA-induced
cytosine methylation in maize, as well as to explore the role of MOP1-
mediated RdDM in ABA-induced epigenetic responses. The cap-
tured regions were selected based on several criteria as previously
described (Han et al. 2018) and included a total of 21,822 loci with a
mean length of 285 bp, representing 15 Mb (,1% of the B73
maize genome), and were aligned to the B73v4 reference genome
(Jiao et al. 2017).
Consistent with the previously described loss of RdDM activity
in mop1-1 mutants (Gent et al. 2014; Li et al. 2014), the biggest difference
in cytosine methylation in our control samples was observed in the CHH
context (68% CHH reduction in mop1-1 mutants relative to wildtype;
compared to 14% CHG and 3% CG) (comparison D, Figure 4A).

Interestingly, a slight increase in methylation in response to ABA
treatment was observed in the CHG and CHH sequence contexts
(1.6% and 11.1% respectively; comparison A, Figure 4A) in a unique
manner in Mop1 wildtype plants, suggesting ABA-induced cytosine
methylation at speciﬁc loci. It is worth noting that Mop1 wildtype plants
introgressed into the B73 genome had lower than average CHH meth-
ylation compared to B73 plants treated with MS or ABA (Figure 4B)
and the methylated CHH (mCHH) increase in the Mop1 WT promoter
region in response to ABA is similar to the untreated B73 methylation
level. An ABA-dependent increase in CHH methylation was not ob-
served for B73 plants in this experiment. Therefore, further experiments
would be needed to separate the effects of pedigree-related epigenetic
differences that may stem from a genomic exposure to mop1-1 homo-
zygous conditions and may take multiple generations to recover from.
A promoter analysis of genotype/treatment combinations in all
three cytosine methylation sequence contexts shows an increase in

DNA methylation in the CHH context in ABA-treated Mop1 wild-
type when compared to MS-treated wildtype plants (Figure 4B). An
additional promoter analysis correlating the methylation percentage
in this region for ABA-responsive DEGs and non-DEGs was per-
formed (Figure S4). We observed that wildtype plants had higher
CHH methylation within the ﬁrst 1000 bp upstream from the TSS of
ABA-responsive DEGs (Groups I, II, V and VI). This ABA-induced
DNA methylation change is not observed as a response to this
hormone in the mop1-1 mutant, which suggests that MOP1 might
be necessary for an epigenetic environmental response in maize
seedlings (Figure 4B, Figure S4). The percent differences in DNA
methylation for comparison A were measured in the promoter region
of wildtype ABA-responsive DEGs (Groups I and II). Regions of 2 kb
(0 to -2.0 Kb), 1 kb (0 to -1.0 Kb), and 500 bp (-0.25 to -0.75 Kb)
upstream of TSS were assayed (Figure 4C, File S9). The average
methylation differences between ABA-up (Group I) and downregu-
lated (Group II) genes becomes more apparent in the smaller pro-
moter region (500 bp), closer to the TSS in the CHH context,
suggesting a dynamic transient methylation change as a response
to ABA levels that are correlated with gene expression regulation
(Figure 4C). A GO term analysis of Group II genes that show
an increase in CHH methylation in their promoter region identiﬁed
four biological process GO terms related to response to endogenous
stimulus (GO:0009719, FDR 6.1 e-5; GO:0009725, FDR 6.1 e-5;
GO:0010033; FDR 0.0007, GO:0042221, FDR 0.02) and four molecular
function GO terms related to hydrolase and transferase activity of
glycosyl compounds (GO:0004553, FDR 0.0011; GO:0016798, FDR
0.0015; GO:0016758, FDR 0.016; GO:0016757, FDR 0.024). The in-
crease in CHH methylation of this group of genes during ABA
treatment suggests the transcriptional epigenetic regulatory machinery
in maize seedlings during environmental stimuli tends to direct gene
silencing toward mechanisms involved in metabolism in order to
efﬁciently activate processes of stress response and recovery.
MOP1 function has been previously correlated with genomic
regions adjoining particular types of transposable elements and genic
regions (Madzima et al. 2014; Li et al. 2015a), suggesting that this
regulatory pathway functions to maintain distinct transcriptional
activities within genomic spaces, and that loss of MOP1 may modify
the responsiveness of some loci to other regulatory pathways. We
analyzed the enrichment of individual TE families in regions adjacent
to ABA-regulated genes in the mop1-1 mutant that contain ABA-
responsive cis-regulatory elements (ABREs) (177 and 67 DEGs from
Groups V and VI, respectively). Approximately 50% of the TEs found
within 2 kb upstream of the transcription start sites (TSS) or 2 kb
downstream of the transcription termination sites (TTS) of genes
predicted to be common MOP1-ABA regulatory gene targets belong
to the Pif/Harbinger (DTH) and Tc1/Mariner (DTT) superfamilies of
the class II DNA TIR transposons. This is consistent with previous
reports (Gent et al. 2013) and shows a considerable change in the
number of DTH and DTT transposons at these loci when compared
Figure 3 Model of maize transcription factor hierarchical network. Maize genes orthologous to Arabidopsis genes in a hierarchical, ABA-responsive
network (Song et al. 2016) were identiﬁed among ABA-responsive DEGs in Mop1 wildtype and mop1-1 plants. Transcription Factors are separated
in three levels based on the Arabidopsis hierarchical regulatory model (TF level 1, 2, and 3). Target genes are clustered by function (Transport,
Metabolism, Receptors, Phosphatases, Kinases, and E3 ligases). Node color corresponds to log2FC. Nodes that lack a border are differentially
expressed in both wildtype and mutant in response to ABA; nodes with a dotted border are differentially expressed only in the mop1-1 mutant; and
nodes with solid borders are differentially expressed only in wildtype.

to the B73 genome (Figure 5, File S10). In our study, the DTH
superfamily of TEs was 12% and 15% more abundant near upregu-
lated and downregulated genes, respectively, compared to the distri-
bution of this TE category across the B73 genome. Additionally, the
DTT elements were half as abundant near ABRE-containing ABA-
downregulated genes in the mop1-1 mutant than near ABA-upregulated
genes or across the B73 genome. These ﬁndings suggest that loss of
MOP1 may modify how responsive these genes are to other regulatory
pathways like ABA, due to changes in TE transcriptional maintenance
at these loci.
Gene expression responses to ABA involve coordination
of cis-elements, CHH methylation, and MOP1-
mediated effects
Genes directly induced or repressed by ABA are expected to have
canonical ABA cis-regulatory sequences that are recognized by ABA-
phosphorylated TFs. To predict primary transcriptional targets of
ABA, we searched for ABRE and CE cis-regulatory elements within
the putative promoters of DEGs in ABA-treated wildtype (Groups I
and II) and mutant (Groups V and VI) samples.
Out of the total 858 genes in Groups I and II, this analysis was
limited to 774 genes with a named gene model in the annotated
maize genome version 40 (Zea_mays.AGPv4.40.gtf, Ensembl-
Plants; (Kersey et al. 2018)) (File S5). One hunded thirteen
(113) genes were identiﬁed as ABA primary targets: 94 were
identiﬁed to have potential ABRE and CE sites within the 2 kb
sequence upstream of the transcription start sites (TSS) using the
MEME-suite (Bailey et al. 2015) (File S5) and the remaining
19 genes were identiﬁed through a literature search of genes
empirically demonstrated to be directly regulated by ABA in
previous published studies (File S5). Based on the GRN (Huang
et al. 2018), 23 of these 113 genes are predicted to regulate the
expression of a collective group of 501 genes. These 23 genes are
TFs (14 genes) and Prh/PP2CA (8 genes), with one of unknown
category. Within these 501 genes, 75 were also predicted to contain
ABA-responsive cis-regulatory elements and be directly regulated
by ABA, while 426 genes were exclusively predicted to be sec-
ondary targets (File S5).
We identiﬁed a negative correlation between transcription and
CHH methylation speciﬁcally in downregulated ABRE/CE contain-
ing genes (ABA-primary targets) in ABA-treated Mop1 wildtype
seedlings. Of 113 ABA-primary targets, 92 were upregulated and
21 were downregulated in ABA-treated wildtype plants. Of the
21 downregulated ABA-primary targets, 14 exhibited an increased
in CHH methylation, in contrast to the upregulated primary ABA-
induced genes, where no change in CHH methylation was observed
for any of the 92 genes. In mop1-1 plants, 5 of these 14 genes are not
downregulated nor do they exhibit CHH methylation in the ABRE
proximal regions. This suggests that a subset of genes may be
methylated and downregulated by a MOP1-dependent pathway in
response to ABA. Induction of ABA-dependent MOP1-mediated
methylation is also revealed by the increase in CHH methylation
around TSS in response to ABA in Mop1 wildtype, but not mop1-1
mutant plants (Figure 4).
A total of 244 DEGs in ABA-treated mop1-1 mutants were
predicted to be ABA primary response genes based on the performed
motif enrichment analysis and previously published experiments
(File S5). Using these primary targets as predicted regulators in
the GRN (Huang et al. 2018), differential expression of secondary
targets by these primary targets could explain the change in expres-
sion of the 1,362 out of 1,542 genes that were not predicted to be
primary response genes (File S5). Collectively, primary responses and
their predicted secondary targets account for 90% of ABA-induced
changes in gene expression in the mop1-1 mutant, suggesting that a
cascade of regulatory effects largely explains the combined effects of a
loss of MOP1 and exposure to ABA.

DISCUSSION
In response to changing and potentially growth-limiting environ-
mental conditions, plants have evolved adaptive physiological mech-
anisms that are often linked to activation or repression of gene
expression. Extensive research in the ﬁeld has uncovered an in-
creasingly complex network of regulation that includes cross talk
between many different types of stressors, phytohormones, and
regulatory mechanisms (reviewed by kundu and Gantait 2017;
Dangi et al. 2018). Important components of the regulation of gene
expression in plants include epigenetic and ABA-induced transcrip-
tional regulation (reviewed by Vishwakarma et al. 2017; Annacondia
et al. 2018). Plant responses to stress are often non-additive, and
simultaneous exposures to multiple stimuli have been documented to
induce changes in gene expression that are distinct from either
stimulus individually (Mittler 2006; Atkinson and Urwin 2012).
Recent evidence suggests a particular importance of siRNA-mediated
responses to stress-induced changes in gene expression (reviewed by
Khraiwesh et al. 2012; Wang and Chekanova 2016). Therefore, this
study sought to understand how mop1-1 plants, known to have
reduced 24-nt siRNA levels in maize (Nobuta et al. 2008), would
respond to ABA at the level of gene expression. The patterns of gene
expression observed in this study support a hierarchical model of
gene expression similar to that proposed to explain environmental
stress responses in the model plant Arabidopsis, which includes
3 interconnected tiers of transcriptional regulators that, directly
and indirectly, regulate the expression of many ABA-responsive
target genes (Song et al. 2016). The work reported herein also
supports the integration of MOP1-mediated regulation into these
hierarchical plant responses and coordinate epigenetic and stimulus-
driven regulation.
Our analysis of gene expression in V3 maize seedlings in the
presence and absence of exogenous ABA treatment uncovered ge-
nome-wide changes in gene expression. Many of these changes were
genotype independent and included many known examples of ABA-
responsive genes in plants. Consistent with known pleiotropic phe-
notypes in mop1-1 homozygous plants, the analysis also revealed that
mop1-1 mutants did not respond to ABA treatment in an identical
manner to their wildtype siblings. These differences could be
explained by the disruption of a hierarchical regulatory pathway,
with a cascade of effects on gene expression, MOP1-dependent
responses to ABA in maize, and combined direct and indirect effects
of MOP1 and ABA response acting in synergy to create non-additive

gene expression proﬁles across the genome. The largest number of
differentially expressed genes was detected in mop1-1 plants that had
been exposed to exogenous ABA. This suggests that some distinct
genes become more responsive to ABA in the absence of MOP1, while
some ABA-responsive genes are unresponsive to ABA in the absence
of MOP1. These relationships may be evidence of coordination
between ABA-mediated and MOP1-mediated regulatory pathways
and reinforce the idea that epigenetic regulation is crucial to plant
response and adaptation to abiotic stress. These results also support
the idea of the presence of epigenetically silenced genes that are
“hidden” from ABA-responsiveness in Mop1 wildtype. This cryptic
variation is epigenetically “uncovered” in the mop1-1 mutant in
response to ABA as differentially expressed epi-alelles.
To estimate direct and indirect MOP1-mediated effects, we
explored the distribution of MOP1-dependent siRNAs in the pre-
dicted promoter regions of DEGs. The genes that are downregulated
in mop1-1 plants are often regarded as indirect targets of a loss of
MOP1 because of the canonically accepted silencing activity of MOP1
dependent pathways. However, these genes also appear to be enriched
for 59 proximal MOP1-dependent siRNAs; one potential explanation
for this would be the coordinated activity of RdDM and ROS1-
dependent demethylation to maintain gene activity, as has been
described in Arabidopsis (Lei et al. 2015; Williams et al. 2015). Some
of the RdDM targets are promoter regions that can be actively
demethylated by ROS1 (Agius, Kapoor, & Zhu 2006; Morales-Ruiz
Et Al. 2006; Penterman, Zilberman, Et Al., 2007). RDR2 is an essential
component of RdDM and is the MOP1 homolog in Arabidopsis. In
the rdr2 background, CG hypermethylation was found in the pro-
moter region of downregulated ROS1 target genes, suggesting ROS1
demethylation is associated with RDR2 (Penterman Et Al. 2007).
Many stress-responsive genes are also downregulated in a triple DNA
demethylase mutant (Le Et Al. 2014). Consistently, ROS1 is required
for transcriptional activation via demethylation of speciﬁc ABA-
inducible genes (Kim et al. 2019). These genes contain TEs and
show DNA methylation changes in their promoters, suggesting that
RdDM might mediate regulation of stress-responsive genes in a
manner that involves DNA demethylation (Le Et Al. 2014).
There are multiple genes in the maize genome with amino acid
sequence similarity to Arabidopsis ROS1 (reviewed by Madzima,
Sloan et al. 2014), and at least one of them appears to be down-
regulated and not responsive to ABA induction of expression in
mop1-1 seedlings. It is therefore possible that some of the genes
identiﬁed in this analysis are additional examples of coordinate
regulation by RdDM-gene silencing and demethylation-associated
transcriptional activation, and that disruption of this coordinated
regulation relates to some of the phenotypes exhibited by mop1-1
homozygous plants.
It is possible that the upregulated genes in mop1-1 plants for which
MOP1-dependent siRNAs were not identiﬁed are indirect targets of
MOP1, or that siRNAs exist but were not detected in the datasets used
for this analysis because of tissue-speciﬁc differences in siRNA
populations or incompletely annotated gene models. Based upon
the diverse and diffuse gene expression phenotypes observed, it is
likely that there are different explanations for the responses of
different groups of genes.
The sequence-capture methylation analysis allowed us to identify
a handful of examples in which there is an overlap between ABA and
RdDM regulatory mechanisms. Previous studies have reported an
increase in non-CG methylation (CHG and CHH) in intergenic TE
sequences in response to osmotic stress, which induces ABA bio-
synthesis and is associated with a transient epigenetic adaptation to
environmental cues (Wibowo et al. 2018). This is consistent with the
fact that CHH methylation is not stochastic and has been observed to
change as a response to abiotic stress in plant species (Dubin et al.
2015; Secco et al. 2015; Wibowo et al. 2018). The role of ABA in DNA
methylation/demethylation and gene expression processes in maize is
not yet understood.
Interpreting the complexity of plant responses to the environment
is essential to a complete understanding of plant growth, develop-
ment and physiology, with particular regard to crop yield and
agricultural challenges. By perturbing phytohormone levels and an
essential component of epigenetic regulation, some unique plant
responses were observed. These results shed some insight onto the
nature of combinatorial, and potentially synergistic, regulation of
gene expression in maize.

Figure 5 Percentage of transposable elements (TEs)
within each TE superfamily. TEs detected within 2 kb
upstream or downstream of genes with ABREs or CEs
that were upregulated (white) or downregulated
(stripes) in mop1-1 mutant plants treated with ABA
represented multiple TE categories. The TEs ana-
lyzed include Class I of LTR retrotransposons Copia
(RLC), Gypsy (RLG), and unclassiﬁed (RLX), LINES L1
(RIL) and RTE (RIT), and SINES (RST) as well as class II
of DNA TIR transposons hAT (DTA), CACTA (DTC),
Pif/Harbinger (DTH), Mutator (DTM), Tc1/Mariner
(DTT), and unclassiﬁed TIR (DTX), and the Helitron
superfamily (DHH). The abundance of the same TE
families across the B73 genome (black; 338,224 TEs)
was used as a comparison against mop1-1 ABREs/
CEs-containing ABA-upregulated (103 TEs) and
downregulated (42 TEs) genes. Bars depict the per-
centage (y-axis) of the TE categories (x-axis) in each
subset that belong to each TE family.
