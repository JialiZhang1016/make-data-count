ABSTRACT
Objectives: Women diagnosed with breast cancer are offered treatment and therapy based on tumor
characteristics, including tumor diameter. There is scarce knowledge whether tumor diameter is accur-
ately reported, or whether it is unconsciously rounded to the nearest half-centimeter (terminal digit
preference). This study aimed to assess the precision (number of digits) of breast cancer tumor diame-
ters and whether they are affected by terminal digit preference. Furthermore, we aimed to assess the
agreement between mammographic and histopathologic tumor diameter measurements.
Material and Methods: This national registry study included reported mammographic and registered
histopathologic tumor diameter information from the Cancer Registry of Norway for invasive breast
cancers diagnosed during 2012–2016. Terminal digit preference was assessed using histograms.
Agreement between mammographic and histopathologic measurements was assessed using the intra-
class correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman plots.
Results: Mammographic, histopathologic, or both tumor measurements were available for 7792,
13,541 and 6865 cases, respectively. All mammographic and 97.2% of histopathologic tumor diameters
were recorded using whole mm. Terminal digits of zero or five were observed among 38.7% and
34.8% of mammographic and histopathologic measurements, respectively. There was moderate agree-
ment between the two measurement methods (ICC ¼ 0.52, 95% CI: 0.50–0.53). On average, mammo-
graphic
measurements
were
1.26 mm
larger
(95%
limits
of
agreement:
22.29–24.73)
than
histopathologic measurements. This difference increased with increasing tumor size.
Conclusion: Terminal digit preference was evident among breast cancer tumor diameters in this
nationwide study. Further studies are needed to investigate the potential extent of under-staging and
under-treatment resulting from this measurement error.

Introduction
Preferential overrepresentation of certain terminal digits (ter-
minal digit preference) is a well-known source of measure-
ment error in medicine, including the measurement of
malignant tumors [1–3]. Some evidence suggests that pathol-
ogists measuring breast tumor diameter favor terminal digits
of zero or five, though few studies have evaluated this type
of measurement error as a primary objective [3–6]. Moreover,
terminal digit preference in breast radiology is not well
described.
Pretreatment clinical tumor size (cT) informs neoadjuvant
and surgical treatment decisions, while pathological tumor
size (pT) informs adjuvant therapy and follow-up. The tumor-
node-metastasis (TNM) framework defines breast tumor size
categories (T categories) T1–T3 based on maximum diameter,
where T1: 20 mm, T2: >20–50 mm, and T3: >50 mm [7,8].
T4 refers to any tumor with direct extension to the chest
wall and/or skin, and TX refers to cases where the tumor
diameter has not or cannot be assessed [7–9].
In
Norway,
the
clinician
responsible
for
securing
a
patient’s diagnosis reports the cT category from either palpa-
tion (calipers), ultrasound, mammography, or magnetic res-
onance
imaging.
In
the
absence
of
information
from
palpation, radiologic imaging, including mammography, pro-
vides influential information when determining cT, but cT
can under- or overestimate pT [10,11]. Accurate estimates of
cT and pT are important for optimal clinical decision-making
and personalized treatment.

ACTA ONCOLOGICA
https://doi.org/10.1080/0284186X.2019.1669817
The World Health Organization (WHO) and American
Joint Committee on Cancer have advised for many years
that breast cancer tumor measurements be reported to the
nearest mm – recent editions provide detailed guidance on
rounding
[7–9].
Norwegian
guidelines
are
based
on
the WHO guidelines and also adhere to those from the
national breast cancer screening program, BreastScreen
Norway [12,13].
In Norway, mammographic and histopathological tumor
diameters are routinely reported and registered at the
Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN). We wanted to determine
whether
terminal
digit
preference was present among
these population-based data, and describe the precision to
which pathologic tumor diameter was reported. As a sec-
ondary
objective,
we
aimed
to
assess
the
agreement
between mammographic and histopathologic tumor diam-
eter measurements.
Methods
Data source
All data were extracted from the CRN. Mandatory reporting
of cancer cases from multiple sources ensures complete and
high quality data [14,15]. Roughly 30% of all breast cancers
nationwide
are
screen-detected
through
BreastScreen
Norway, which is administered by the CRN and offers bien-
nial mammographic screening to all female residents aged
50–69 [15,16].
Information about mammographic and histopathologic
tumor diameter is sent to the CRN via standardized elec-
tronic radiology reports from radiologists, and via electronic
or paper-based histopathology reports from pathologists.
Radiology reports are registered automatically at the CRN,
while histopathology reports are registered manually.
Study sample
We included information about mammographic and histo-
pathological tumor diameter from all incident invasive breast
cancers diagnosed during 2012–2016 among women resid-
ing in Norway.
The first invasive breast cancer diagnosed per woman
during the study period was included. Only the largest lesion
was included for women diagnosed with multifocal or bilat-
eral breast cancer. We excluded women with pT4 lesions,
cases where the longest measured mammographic or histo-
pathologic tumor diameter was 100 mm, and cases with no
recorded tumor diameter (e.g., pTX).
This project was approved by Oslo University Hospital’s
privacy ombudsman (PVO 19/02585) [17].
Study variables
We extracted information about women’s age and year of
diagnosis, and mode of detection, which was classified as
screen-detected (diagnosed within six months after a positive
screening mammogram in BreastScreen Norway), or clinically
detected (not screen-detected). Histologic tumor classifica-
tion (invasive carcinoma of no special type (NST), lobular, or
other), the largest mammographic and histopathologic tumor
diameter measured (mm; hereafter referred to as mammo-
graphic and histopathologic tumor diameter, respectively),
and cT and pT classifications were also extracted.
Mammographic tumor diameter
Mammographic tumor diameter was measured on digitally
acquired images using electronic calipers in a clinical setting
by the examining radiologist. Measurements could be taken
from screening or diagnostic mammographic examinations,
from either standard 2D images (with or without contrast),
spot compression views (with or without magnification),
tomosynthesis images, or synthetic 2D images derived from
tomosynthesis. Images were displayed on DICOM-compliant
workstations after retrieval from a picture archiving and com-
munication
system
(PACS).
The
type
of
mammography
equipment,
viewing
workstations,
and
PACS
varied
between centers.
There are no national guidelines describing mammo-
graphic tumor measurement methods. For mammographi-
cally visible cases, radiologists typically reported the tumor
diameter in whole mm in the patient’s radiology report on
the day of the examination. Thereafter, this measurement
was entered into the report sent to the CRN.
Histopathologic tumor diameter
Based on national recommendations, tumor diameter was
determined from microscopic slides by measuring the outer-
most boundaries of the invasive lesion, and measured to the
nearest mm using a transparent ruler [12]. If this could not
be done using the available slides, the measurement was
based on the macroscopic examination (formalin fixed speci-
men), either from a single tissue slice, or as an estimate
across all tissue slices containing microscopically verified
invasive tumor tissue [7].
Measurement precision
All mammographic measurements must be sent to the CRN
as whole mm.
Histopathologic tumor diameter could be registered with
one decimal place if it was reported as such (e.g., for small
invasive lesions), but national recommendations advise path-
ologists to report tumor diameter using whole mm [12,13].
T-category information
The clinician responsible for securing a patient’s diagnosis,
often the patient’s surgeon, reported the cT category directly
to the CRN. Due to a high proportion of missing and unavail-
able data [18], we derived a surrogate assessment, mT, using
the mammographic tumor diameter. The mT variable was
used in all analyses requiring information about cT.
The pT category was manually set by dedicated coders at
the CRN based on the maximum tumor diameter and tumor

path-
ology reports.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive results were presented as means (standard devia-
tions, SDs, or ranges), or frequencies (%). Histograms were
used to present the frequency distributions of tumor diam-
eter measurements, stratified by measurement type (mam-
mographic vs histopathologic), and the number of decimal
places (zero or one). To focus on the cut-points for T1–T3
tumors, some figures were restricted to cases with tumors
55 mm. Using the same stratification variables, we reported
the proportion of different terminal digits among tumors of
varying sizes and used histograms to visualize overall ter-
minal digit frequencies.
To study agreement between mammographic and histopa-
thologic tumor diameter for cases where both measurements
were available, we estimated means and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs); Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) and an
asymptotic 95% CI based on Fisher’s z transformation; and the
intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and 95% CI based on a
single measurement, one-way random effects model for abso-
lute agreement [19]. A scatterplot and Bland-Altman plot were
used to visualize the differences between mammographic and
histopathologic measurements and to calculate the absolute
and relative mean differences and 95% limits of agreement
(LOA) using raw and natural log transformed data. We pre-
sented the relative mean difference and 95% LOA because
the magnitude of the differences appeared to be associated
with tumor diameter [20]. Lastly, the mT and pT categories
were compared using proportions of agreement/disagree-
ment, and a weighted Kappa with Cicchetti-Allison weights
(jw). Bowker’s test was used to test symmetry.
An ad hoc analysis of cases with a terminal digit of zero
or five from mammography or histopathology was con-
ducted using a scatterplot, and Bland-Altman plots for raw
and natural log transformed data.
All statistical analyses were performed in R version 3.5.0
for Windows [21]. The irr package was used to calculate the
ICC and corresponding CI, while the DescTools package was
used to calculate jw and its corresponding CI [22,23].
Results
During 2012–2016, 16,767 women were diagnosed with
invasive breast cancer in Norway. After applying exclusion
criteria, the final study sample consisted of 14,468 invasive
breast tumors with mammographic or histopathologic tumor
diameter information in the same number of women (Figure
1(A)).
Tumor
diameter
information
from
mammography,
histopathology, or both sources was available for 7792;
13,541; and 6865 cases, respectively (Figure 1(B)).
The mean age at diagnosis in the final study sample was
62 years (range 23–103), and 57% of women were aged
50–69 (Table 1). Overall, roughly 35% of cancers were
screen-detected, and 82% of all cancers were invasive carcin-
oma of no special type (Table 1). The subsample of women
with mammographic tumor information was slightly older
than that with histopathologic information (means (SDs) 62.2
(11.7), and 61.7 (12.6) years, respectively).
Precision
All mammographic tumor diameters were recorded as whole
numbers (median 18 mm, range 1–99). Nearly all (97.2%,
n ¼ 13,167) of the histopathologic diameters were recorded
as whole numbers (median 17 mm, range 1–95); the remain-
ing cases (2.8%) were recorded with a single decimal
(median 7.4 mm, range 0.1–50.1).
Terminal digit preference
Histograms of the distribution of mammographic and histo-
pathologic tumor diameters recorded as whole numbers
showed high frequencies of multiples of five and drops
around these peaks that corresponded to numbers ending in

one, four, six, or nine (Figure 2(A,B)). A histogram of the his-
topathologic tumor diameters recorded with one decimal
place also showed a high frequency had a terminal digit of
five (Supplementary Figure S1).
Histograms of the terminal digits from mammographic
and histopathologic tumor diameters recorded as whole
numbers also showed a high frequency of zeroes and fives,
compared to ones, fours, sixes, and nines (Figure 2(C,D)). A
terminal digit of zero was more frequent than five among
tumor diameters measured from mammography (23.4% and
15.3%, respectively), but not from histopathology (17.9% for
both; Supplementary Table S1). The proportion of tumor
diameters with terminal digit of five generally increased as
mammographic or histopathologic tumor diameter increased.
This was also observed for a terminal digit of zero, but only
for tumors 20 mm (Supplementary Table S1). Among the
histopathologic measurements recorded with one decimal,
61% of cases had a decimal value of five, and none had a
decimal value of zero (Figure 2(E)).
Agreement between mammographic and
histopathologic assessments
Among cases for which a mammographic and histopatho-
logic tumor diameter were available (n ¼ 6865), the median
(range) tumor diameters were 16 mm (1–99) and 15 mm
(0.1–90), respectively. We observed moderate correlation
between the two assessments: r ¼ 0.52 (95% CI: 0.51–0.54),
and ICC ¼ 0.52 (95% CI: 0.50–0.53). On average, mammo-
graphic
tumor
diameters
were
1.26 mm
(95%
LOA:
22.29–24.73) larger than the corresponding histopathologic
diameters. However, there was evidence of disagreement in
both directions, and agreement between the two decreased
as the average tumor diameter increased (Figure 3). On a
relative scale, the mammographic tumor diameters were 1.06
times (6%) larger than the pathologic values (95% LOA:
0.34–3.28) (Supplementary Figure S2). A subgroup analysis
stratified by histologic type showed that for invasive NST,
lobular, or other carcinomas, the mammographic tumor
diameters
were,
on
average,
1.53 mm
(95%
LOA:
21.39–24.45) larger, 1.59 mm (95% LOA: 28.85–25.67)
smaller, and 2.04 mm (95% LOA: 21.06–25.14) larger than
the
corresponding
histopathologic
measurements,
respectively.
Ad hoc analysis of all cases with mammographic and his-
topathologic tumor diameter with a terminal digit of zero or
five (n ¼ 3890) displayed clear graphical patterns in the scat-
ter plot (checkerboard pattern) and the Bland-Altman plots
(lattice pattern; Supplementary Figure S3).
The mT and pT categories were the same in 5313 cases
(77%), while the mT category was highest in 823 (53%) of
the discordant cases (psymmetry<0.0001; Table 2). Overall,
there was moderate agreement between the mT and pT cat-
egories: jw¼0.50, 95% CI: 0.48–0.53.
Discussion
Terminal digit preference in the measurement of breast
tumors is not well-studied and only one of four previously
published studies on this topic used population-based data
[3–6]. Our results from nationwide cancer registry data
showed evidence of terminal digit preference for zeroes and
fives in the reporting of maximum mammographic and histo-
pathologic tumor diameters of invasive breast cancers diag-
nosed during 2012–2016. This measurement error can lead
to T-category misclassification and has the potential to

impact patient treatment. Further, we observed moderate
agreement between mammographic and pathologic tumor
diameter. Mammographic tumor diameter both over- and
underestimated histopathologic tumor diameter, and the
absolute
discrepancy
between
the
two
measurements
increased with increasing tumor diameter.
Among histopathologic tumor diameters, 97.3% of cases
were registered as whole mm, and the majority of those
reported with decimal values were <10 mm. This is a slight
overestimate of the number of cases reported as whole mm
by pathologists because decimal values of zero are truncated
when registered at the CRN. More explicit national guidance
may improve compliance in reporting tumor diameter to the
nearest mm, as advised by international guidelines [7,8].
The overrepresentation of tumor diameters with a ter-
minal digit of zero or five corresponded largely to whole and
half cm values 1 cm on mammography and 1.5 cm from
histopathology. The resulting measurement error appeared
to be due in equal parts to rounding up and down to the
nearest whole or half cm value. A recent Dutch study sug-
gested that pathologists avoided reporting T category border
values of 10 mm and 20 mm, however, these results have not
been corroborated [3–6]. In our study, terminal digit prefer-
ence led to an excess of tumors recorded as 10, 20, or
50 mm, which define the border values for T1c, T2, and
T3 tumors [7–9]. Any tendency to underestimate tumor
diameter by rounding down to the nearest cm increases the
likelihood of under-staging tumors with respect to their T
category and could lead to under-treatment. This limitation
of the TNM system was pointed out as early as 2006, but
even recent suggestions to simplify the TNM system have
overlooked this shortcoming [4,24].
On the other hand, rounding up to 10, 20 or 50 mm does
not change the T category and therefore does not directly
lead to over-staging (e.g., an 18 mm tumor rounded up to
20 mm is classified as T1 in either situation). A tumor that is
under a boundary value (e.g., 18 mm; T1) and is rounded up
to over the boundary value (e.g., 21 mm; T3) would result in
over-staging in terms of the T category, but our study does
not provide evidence about whether this type of round-
ing occurs.
Without knowing which specific cases are affected by ter-
minal digit preference, it is difficult to speculate the scope of
the clinical implications of this measurement error. Studies
that report treatment data and re-measure histopathologic
samples are needed to quantify the number of women who
may potentially be undertreated for their breast cancer due
to under-staging and could have important consequences
for decisions regarding neoadjuvant treatment and surgical
planning, as well as the use of chemo and radiation therapy
and response monitoring.
On average, we observed that mammographic tumor
diameters were slightly larger than the corresponding histo-
pathologic measurements. However, the 95% LOA for this
estimate was wide and indicated that both under- and over-
estimation can occur, as has been observed in other studies
[10,11,25].
We
observed
decreasing
absolute
agreement
between
mammographic
and
histopathologic
tumor
diameter measurements as tumor size increases, which sup-
ports previous findings [10,25]. Despite the measurement dif-
ferences
in
mammographic
and
histopathologic
tumor
diameter, the mT and pT categories assigned to a case were
the same in over 75% of cases. In the remaining cases, par-
ticularly the <2% categorized as mT3 and pT1 or vice-versa,
more
accurate
mammographic
measurement
may
have
increased the likelihood of breast conserving surgery, or
reduced the need for reoperation.
When considering histologic subtype, our study indicated
that mammography underestimates histopathologic tumor
diameter for lobular carcinomas, but results from two single-
centre studies indicate the opposite [10,26]. This discrepancy
may be due to sampling variability, as these two studies
evaluated 99 [10] and 18 [26] cases of lobular carcinoma and
diffuse tumors can be difficult to measure. Our findings cor-
roborate those from a multicentre cohort study that analyzed
474 cases of lobular carcinoma, but do not corroborate their
finding that mammography underestimates histopathologic
tumor diameter for invasive carcinomas NST [25]. Both our
study and that of Stein et al. [25] used retrospective data
and had similar inclusion criteria, but the difference between
mammographic and histopathologic tumor diameter was
roughly 1.5 mm larger across all subgroups in our study,
which would have been enough to change the direction of
the association observed for the sub-analysis of invasive car-
cinomas NST. Because the study samples were similar, we
believe that differences in measurement practices between
countries can explain this discrepancy.
Discrepancies between mammographic and histopatho-
logic measurements can occur due to differential terminal
digit preference between radiologists and pathologists, or
because the measurements are taken at different times and
potentially from different axes of the tumor. They may also
be attributed to measurement challenges associated with
endocrine responsiveness, mammographic breast density, dif-
fuse or multifocal lesions, or shrinkage as a result of neoadju-
vant treatment or formalin fixation [10,11,25,26]. Moreover,
histopathologic measurements can be influenced by the
degree of sampling, particularly from the tumor periphery
and surrounding tissues. We included only invasive T1-T3
breast cancer cases and aimed to exclude those who
received neoadjuvant treatment (pTX) to mitigate some of
these challenges.
Our study design did not allow us to determine whether
terminal digit preference is associated with factors that com-
plicate accurate tumor measurement; this was a limitation of
our study. We hypothesize that only factors that obscure the
tumor periphery (e.g., multifocal or diffuse lesions) may be
associated with increased terminal digit preference, and
future studies might investigate this topic. With respect to
our secondary outcome – agreement between mammo-
graphic and histopathologic tumor diameter measurements
– determining whether factors such as breast density con-
founded the relationships we observed was outside the
scope of this study. This was another limitation of our study.
To the best of our knowledge, studies measuring the

tumor diameter have not considered the potential for meas-
urement error due to terminal digit preference. In our study,
the effects of this preference can be seen in the checker-
board pattern arising in the scatterplot and lattice pattern
arising in the Bland-Altman plots. These patterns are also vis-
ible in the plots of other agreement studies, which suggests
that terminal digit preference is prevalent in the measure-
ment of tumor diameter from mammography and histopath-
ology, as well as from clinical examination, ultrasound and
MRI [10,11,25,27]. Terminal digit preference is therefore an
important source of measurement error in cT-category stag-
ing. This source of measurement error should be more
widely discussed and potentially taken into account when
making neoadjuvant and surgical treatment decisions, par-
ticularly for borderline cases.
The use of prospectively collated data from a population-
based registry is a strength of our study. Reporting to the
CRN is mandated by law, and clinicians working in oncology
do so as a part of routine clinical practice. The data included
in this study are continually used for research and surveil-
lance of BreastScreen Norway, and are constantly assured by
clinicians working in the program. Moreover, pathologic
tumor diameter data at the CRN are subject to annual quality
assurance against the original pathology report, as described
in the appendix. This validation work has not been docu-
mented extensively, but studies using colorectal cancer data
from the CRN and registry-based breast cancer data in
Denmark and Sweden support the notion that pathological
breast cancer tumor diameter data at the CRN reflects that
from the original pathology report [28–30]. Furthermore, the
data used in this study are not affected by clinicians’ aware-
ness of being studied (the Hawthorne effect) [31]. Our results
therefore reflect national standard clinical practice.
Although our sample includes tumor measurements from
a national pool of radiologists and pathologists, our study
did not include information about the individual clinicians
who performed the measurements, and it was not possible
to investigate inter- or intra-observer trends. Moreover, we
did not have information about the specific conditions in
which the mammographic tumor diameter measurements
took place, for example, whether standard 2D images or
tomographic images were used. This is unlikely to be a major
limitation since tumor diameter measurements from both
techniques are relatively similar compared to histopathology
[32]. Additionally, the reasons for missing tumor diameter
data are unclear: data could have been missing because the
clinicians were unable to measure the tumor (e.g., due to it
being mammographically occult), because they failed to
record the measured value, or because the recorded value
was not sent to the CRN. The latter is the most likely explan-
ation for the majority of missing mammographic information
as this data cannot be submitted by centers that are not
affiliated with BreastScreen Norway [33]. Nonetheless, the
overall reporting rate has improved since 2012, and was 72%
in 2016 [33,34]. Only 3% of histopathologic tumor diameter
information was missing for women who had surgery for
breast cancer during 2009–2011 [35], thus missing histopa-
thologic tumor diameter information in our study is likely
due to women receiving neoadjuvant therapy (where post-
treatment staging, ypT, is reported instead of pT). No reason
for missing data seems likely to have caused any systematic
bias in the terminal digits of tumor diameters in the
final sample.
In this population-based study, we observed a preference
for reporting tumor diameters with terminal digits of zero or
five, corresponding to whole and half centimeter values.
Further, our results support the notion that absolute agree-
ment between mammographic and histopathologic tumor
diameter is moderate and decreases with increasing tumor
size. The current guidelines for TNM staging do not consider
terminal digit preference and histopathological review stud-
ies are needed to investigate the potential extent of under-
staging and under-treatment resulting from this source of
measurement error.
