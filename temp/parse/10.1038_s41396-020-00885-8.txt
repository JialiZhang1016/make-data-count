Abstract
Heterotrophic lineages of stramenopiles exhibit enormous diversity in morphology, lifestyle, and habitat. Among them, the
marine stramenopiles (MASTs) represent numerous independent lineages that are only known from environmental
sequences retrieved from marine samples. The core energy metabolism characterizing these unicellular eukaryotes is poorly
understood. Here, we used single-cell genomics to retrieve, annotate, and compare the genomes of 15 MAST species,
obtained by coassembling sequences from 140 individual cells sampled from the marine surface plankton. Functional
annotations from their gene repertoires are compatible with all of them being phagocytotic. The unique presence of
rhodopsin genes in MAST species, together with their widespread expression in oceanic waters, supports the idea that
MASTs may be capable of using sunlight to thrive in the photic ocean. Additional subsets of genes used in phagocytosis,
such as proton pumps for vacuole acidiﬁcation and peptidases for prey digestion, did not reveal particular trends in MAST
genomes as compared with nonphagocytotic stramenopiles, except a larger presence and diversity of V-PPase genes. Our
analysis reﬂects the complexity of phagocytosis machinery in microbial eukaryotes, which contrasts with the well-deﬁned
set of genes for photosynthesis. These new genomic data provide the essential framework to study ecophysiology of
uncultured species and to gain better understanding of the function of rhodopsins and related carotenoids in stramenopiles.
Introduction
Oceans are the largest habitats on Earth, and living biomass
in these systems is dominated by planktonic microbes [1].
Together, they introduce heterogeneity into the ocean,
govern trophic interactions, and drive energy and nutrient
ﬂows [2]. Depending on the way microbes acquire energy
and food, they stand along a trophic spectrum between
phototrophs, which synthesize organic matter using solar
energy and heterotrophs, which live at the expense of
acquired organic matter. The study of trophic strategies is of
primary interest to understand the ecological role and

behavior of microbial species. This basic information is not
always easy to access, especially because as seen in mole-
cular surveys, the vast majority of microbial diversity has
not been cultured and therefore remains uncharacterized [3].
Within marine microbial eukaryotes, an important compo-
nent of this unknown diversity are the marine stramenopiles
(MASTs) lineages [4, 5], placed in different positions of the
stramenopile radiation that include phototrophs, phago-
trophs, mixotrophs, osmotrophs, and parasites [6, 7]. Cur-
rently, MASTs are divided into 18 phylogenetic clades [8],
each one potentially harboring many species which are
essentially uncultured, with only two exceptions, Inciso-
monas marina (MAST-3) and Pseudophyllomitus vesicu-
losus (MAST-6). A clear assignment of the trophic strategy
of MASTs is also challenging because of their small size
and lack of recognizable morphological features. Partial
data exist for a few clades, some MAST-3 are parasites (for
example, the diatom parasite Solenicola setigera belongs to
this clade [9]), MAST-1 and MAST-4 are active bacter-
ivores [10], but this elementary knowledge is still unknown
for many other MAST lineages.
In the last years, MASTs have been under the hook with a
few single-cell genomics (SCG) studies [11]. Despite inherent
methodological limitations, such as uneven coverage, chimeric
assemblies,
and
increased
contamination
[12],
SCG
is
becoming widely used to access the genomes of uncultured
microbial species [13, 14], therefore expanding our knowledge
on marine microbial life and their metabolic potential.
Recently, a catalog of more than 900 single ampliﬁed genomes
(SAGs) isolated during the Tara Oceans expedition has been
described based on their 18S rDNA genes [15]; many of them
afﬁliated to diverse MAST clades and some were chosen for
genome sequencing. In a ﬁrst study, several MAST-4 SAGs
were used to evaluate a computational solution to improve
genome completeness by combining the sequencing reads of
single cells into a coassembly [16]. Another study used this
coassembling approach to obtain the genome of ﬁve MAST-3
and MAST-4 species and explore their functional ecology and
oceanic distribution. This study revealed functional differences
in the motility apparatus and feeding spectra, and the presence
of rhodopsins in one species. Here, we extended the dataset to
15 MAST species using SAGs from Tara Oceans and from
other projects. We investigated their trophic strategy using a
comparative genomics model, and focused on a set of gene
families relevant for phagocytosis.
Phagocytosis is a distinct form of endocytosis that incor-
porates particles > 0.45 µm in diameter through the formation
of membrane-bound vesicles called phagosomes. After
maturation, phagosomes fuse with lysosomes and become a
ﬁnal phagolysosome where prey cells are degraded [17, 18].
Lysosomes are important organelles that can contain more
than 50 degradative enzymes (targeting proteins, carbohy-
drates, or nucleic acids) commonly named acid hydrolases as
they are activated at acidic conditions (i.e., pH < 5). To
maintain the acidic medium and keep control over the
digestive enzymes, phagolysosomes accumulate H+ ions
by the action of the vacuolar-type H+-translocating ATPase
(V-ATPase) [19]. Other proton pumps such as the vacuolar-
type H+-translocating pyrophosphatase (V-PPase) may also
participate in acidiﬁcation [20]. The two proton pumps obtain
their energy by hydrolyzing phosphate bonds, in ATP or
inorganic pyrophosphate, respectively, [21], and represent
distinct classes of ion translocases with no sequence homol-
ogy. Functional related genes that are gaining momentum in
marine microbial ecology are the rhodopsins. Microbial type I
rhodopsins are photoactive proteins containing a retinal
chromophore that work as light-driven proton pumps or
photoreceptors [22, 23]. They are widely present in marine
microbes [24, 25] and have been found in MAST-4-C [26]
and highly expressed in a growing MAST-4A population
[27]. It has been suggested that besides energy processing,
rhodopsins can participate in food vacuole acidiﬁcation in
eukaryotic phagotrophs [28].
In this study, we have analyzed the genomes of 140 single
cells retrieved during the Tara Oceans expedition as well as
at the Blanes Bay Microbial Observatory (BBMO). These
cells afﬁliate within seven MAST clades highly represented
in marine molecular surveys [6]. The 140 SAGs have been
further coassembled into 15 genomes of relatively high
quality and subsequently analyzed by comparative genomics
together with other well-characterized stramenopiles. We ﬁrst
focused on assigning a trophic function to these uncultured
clades by comparative genomics, and then analyzed the
enrichment of the degradative enzymes peptidases according
to trophic function. We also considered in detail the presence
and diversity of proton pumps and microbial rhodopsins in
MASTs to further understand the potential physiological
cell capabilities and the role of light in phagolysosome
acidiﬁcation.
Material and methods
SAG sequencing, assembly, and coassembly
Epipelagic microbial communities sampled during the Tara
Oceans expedition were used for ﬂow cytometry cell sorting at
the Single Cell Sorting Center in Bigelow (scgc.bigelow.org)
based on size and the presence or absence of pigments.
Whole-genome ampliﬁcation from single cells was done with
MDA, and SAGs were taxonomically classiﬁed by sequencing
their 18S rDNA ampliﬁed with universal eukaryotic primers.
Details of the methods used and a complete list of taxa ID for
all SAGs collected in Tara are presented in Sieracki et al. [15].
Overall, 74 of the SAGs used here have been sequenced and
analyzed previously [16, 26, 29], while 50 SAGs are new from
1768
A. Labarre et al.
this study (Table S1). We did a single-cell sorting effort at the
BBMO in May 2018 using similar protocols that provided 16
additional SAGs. Sequencing libraries for cells collected in
Tara were prepared as described before [26], while we used
the KAPA or NextEra preparation kits in BBMO cells. SAGs
were paired-end sequenced (reads of 110 bp in Tara and 250
bp in BBMO) in different Illumina platforms and sequencing
services (Table S1).
After adapter trimming and cleaning of the raw reads
using Trimmomatic v. 0.32 [30] (reads with a Phred score <
20 and <100 bp were discarded), we performed a digital k-
mer-based normalization with BBNorm (sourceforge.net/
projects/bbmap/) that reduces the average error rate and
allows downsampling of reads for a better coverage dis-
tribution (a critical issue with MDA products). An initial de
novo assembly using the De Bruijn graph assembler SPAdes
[31], combining information from 21, 33, and 55 k-mer
sizes, was generated for every individual SAG read set.
Based on previous work [16, 29], we followed a stringent
coassembly strategy. SAGs eligible for coassembly were
those with very high 18S rDNA similarity (>99.5%) and
average nucleotide identity (>95%), and tetranucleotide
homogeneity veriﬁed with the Emergent Self-Organizing
Maps tool (http://databionic-esom.sourceforge.net) using a
1 bp sliding window in fragmented contigs of 2.5–5 kb. The
formed clusters were validated with robust estimates of
mean and variance (“Robust ZT” option). Coassembly was
done with SPAdes including the “single-cell” option. We
identiﬁed (and later removed) prokaryotic contamination in
the assembled scaffolds with the default parameters of
EukRep [32] and BlobTools [33]. Contigs with divergent
GC content values in each coassembly (outside the range of
mean ± 10% standard deviation) were also removed. In one
of the sequencing batches, cross-contamination between
SAGs in the same Illumina lane occurred due to HiSeq
reagents problems. We computed the average nucleotide
identity [34] between contigs in all pairs of individual SAGs,
identiﬁed problematic contigs (those that share similarity >
99% in fragments longer than 300 bp), and removed those
from the SAG where they had the lowest k-mer read cov-
erage. In the ﬁnal coassemblies, contigs shorter than 1 kb
were removed, and genome statistics were computed with
QUAST [35]. Genome completeness was determined by the
presence of 248 universal, single-copy core eukaryotic genes
with CEGMA [36] or the presence of 303 single-copy
eukaryotic orthologous genes with BUSCO v3 [37].
Gene predictions, gene family inference, and
functional annotation
Gene predictions from the coassembled genomes started by
using the CEGMA and BUSCO retrieved genes to train
SNAP
(http://korﬂab.ucdavis.edu/software.html),
which
generates a set of ab initio gene models. In parallel,
GENEMARK-ES [38] was run to obtain another set of
predicted genes. Both sets were then used as input for a ﬁrst
run on the MAKER [39] pipeline. The candidate genes
identiﬁed were then used as the training dataset input in a
second run of MAKER, with default settings, to train the
program AUGUSTUS [40], ﬁnally providing transcripts
and protein predictions for each coassembled genome. The
pipeline used can be found on GitHub (https://github.com/
guyleonard/gene_prediction_pipeline).
Predicted coding sequences (CDS) from the coassembled
MAST genomes were loaded into a custom instance of the
PLAZA framework [41] together with the CDS of other
stramenopiles and nonstramenopile model species (Fig. S1).
Based on an “all-against-all” protein sequence similarity
search done with DIAMOND v. 0.9.18 [42] (“more sensi-
tive” mode with a maximum e-value cutoff of 10−5 and
retaining up to 2500 hits), orthologous gene families were
delineated with OrthoFinder v. 2.3.3 [43] (default para-
meters). Functional annotation of all CDS was performed
using InterProScan v. 5.39–77.0 [44], including mapping
InterPro entries to GO annotations. For the model organ-
isms in the database (Fig. S1), GO annotations were
retrieved from the GO website. Finally, functional enrich-
ment analyses were performed to assign informative Inter-
Pro and GO terms to each orthologous gene family. The
enrichment analysis used the hypergeometric distribution
with a maximum Bonferroni corrected p value cutoff of
0.05, and all coding genes from the organisms included in
the gene family as background frequency. Enriched func-
tional annotations were retained when present in at least half
of the genes in the family.
Comparative genomics analysis
We used a computational model designed to predict, using
genomic data, if an organism has the ability to be phago-
cytotic (able to capture prey), photosynthetic (able to ﬁx
inorganic carbon), or prototrophic (self-sufﬁcient producer
of essential amino acids or vitamins) [45]. The model is
based on clusters of shared proteins among a large diversity
of eukaryotic genomes and on an evaluation of their
enrichment in organisms adopting different lifestyles. The
presence of speciﬁc proteins in the query genomes, detected
by a search with HMM models, is used to predict the life-
style of unknown organisms.
On a second level, we used the number of copies for each
orthologous gene family (or orthologous group, OG) in
every species to identify broad patterns within the 30 stra-
menopile species. OGs found in only one species were
discarded, and the number of genes per OGs was normal-
ized to percentages in each genome. Based on the OG table,
genomes were compared using Bray–Curtis dissimilarities

and
analyzed
by

multidimensional
scaling
(NMDS) with the R package vegan v2.5–6 [46]. The
grouping of species based on trophic lifestyle was tested by
a PERMANOVA analysis using vegan’s function adonis2
(). A multilevel pattern analysis to identify OGs that char-
acterize a given trophic mode (indicator value (IndVal) >
0.7 and p value < 0.05) was performed using the function
multipatt() implemented in the R package indicspecies
v1.7.9 [47]. A heatmap displaying OGs annotated as pep-
tidases and proteases was created with R package pheatmap
v1.0.12 [48], using Ward’s method for hierarchical clus-
tering with log10-transformed OGs gene counts (with a
pseudocount of 1).
Homology searches and phylogenetic analyses for
speciﬁc proteins
Protein sequences from three gene families of proton pumps
were retrieved from public databases. Reference sequences
for V-ATPases were extracted from Mulkidjanian et al. [49],
while for V-PPases we used the phylogenetic tree in Good-
enough et al. [20]. Rhodopsin reference sequences were col-
lected from several articles [28, 50, 51], and the MicRhoDE
project [52]. Using these reference datasets, homologous
MAST sequences were identiﬁed by sequence similarity
using BLAST v.2.2.28 (maximum e-value threshold of 10−5).
The selected contigs were checked to discard potential bac-
terial contamination. Homology searches using Pfam domains
were conducted against the key enzymes involved in retinal
formation: GGPP synthase (PF00348), phytoene synthase
(PF00484.18), phytoene dehydrogenase (PF01493.23), lyco-
pene cyclase (PF05834), and β-carotene 15,15′-dioxygenase
(PF15461.5). Selected sequences were aligned with MAFFT
v7.470 [53] (--globalpair) and trimmed with TRIMAL v1.4
[54] (-automated option) to obtain a curated subset for phy-
logenetic analyses. Phylogenetic trees were constructed with
the
maximum
likelihood
method
using
the
LG+F
+R6 substitution model in IQ-TREE [55] and topology
support was determined with 1000 bootstrap replicates.
Rhodopsin expression data were retrieved from the Marine
Atlas of Tara Oceans Unigenes database (MATOU) [56],
which presents expressed eukaryotic genes clustered at 95%
identity. Rhodopsin MAST sequences were used as query in
BLAST 2.7.1 against MATOU v1 and we kept the most
similar unigene for each type.
Results
A new set of MAST genomes
Unicellular eukaryotic microorganisms were single cell sorted
from planktonic assemblages in the Adriatic Sea and the
Indian ocean during the Tara Oceans expedition, and in
Spring 2018 from the BBMO (Fig. 1A). Based on their 18S
rDNA signature, 140 cells from the unpigmented sort that
afﬁliated to MAST lineages were selected for genome
sequencing. Essential sampling and sequencing information
regarding these SAGs is listed in Table S1. SAGs with similar
tetranucleotide frequency and very high nucleotide similarity
(fulﬁlling the criteria explained in M&M) were considered to
be from the same species and combined into a coassembly,
thus yielding improved genomes of 15 MAST species. The
individual SAGs used in each coassembly often derived from
different marine locations (Fig. 1B). Taking into account
contigs ≥1 kb, we obtained genome sizes ranging from 9.13
to 47.80 Mb, each one with a characteristic GC content.
Assembly quality assessments were carried out via the N50,

the size distribution of contigs, and the genome completeness.
The later, based on the percentage of conserved single-copy
orthologous genes present in the ﬁnal coassembly, averaged
46% across genomes, ranging from values as high as 80% in
MAST-4A-sp1 and MAST-4C-sp1 to values as low as 7% in
MAST-1C-sp1 (Fig. 1). Genomes with higher completeness
also recovered more genes: 15,508 genes were predicted in
MAST-4A-sp1, 16,260 in MAST-4C-sp1, and 2902 in
MAST-1C-sp1. Thus, there was a clear correlation between
genome size and both the genome completeness and the
number of predicted genes. Overall, coassembled genomes
provide reasonable gene completeness and represent a very
promising resource to reveal the genes and the metabolic
potential of uncultured MASTs. The 15 species for which we
provide the new genomic data are widespread and relatively
abundant in the global surface ocean (Fig. S2), thus repre-
senting useful targets to understand ecosystem functioning.
Predicting the lifestyle of MAST species from
genomics
We investigated the trophic lifestyle of the 15 MAST spe-
cies using a recently published comparative genomics
model [45]. Speciﬁcally, the training-based model inter-
rogates the genomes of unknown species for the presence of
genes
predictive
of
phagotrophic,
photosynthetic,
or
prototrophic lifestyles (Fig. 2). The model clearly predicted
that none of the MAST species was photosynthetic: all of
them were outside the photosynthetic PCA cluster, with
73% of the variation explained by the ﬁrst principal com-
ponent (Fig. 2A), and virtually zero prediction probabilities
of being photosynthetic (Fig. 2C). Based on the set of genes
deﬁning phagotrophy, the majority of MAST species were
placed with phagocytotic genomes (the ﬁrst principal
component explained 73% of the divergence) and within the
95% conﬁdence ellipse in the PCA plot (Fig. 2B). The
prediction probability for phagotrophy was above 80% in
most cases, but it was very low in four of them, MAST-1C-
sp1, MAST-1D-sp1, MAST-3C-sp2, and MAST-9A-sp1,
precisely the ones that had the lowest number of predicted
genes. At ﬁrst sight, MAST species do not seem to perform
prototrophy, being outside the prototrophic PCA cluster
(Fig. S3). However, the species with most predicted genes
(several MAST-4 and MAST-3A-sp1) display a moderate
prediction probability to present this capacity (Fig. 2C).
Furthermore, while the previous analysis relied on pre-
selected group of genes, we also performed a direct com-
parison of the 15 MAST species against a selection of other
stramenopiles with known lifestyle (Fig. S1) using the num-
ber of genes in inferred OGs within each genome. The cor-
responding NMDS test revealed that the species grouped

strategies:

photosynthetic cluster, an intermixed osmotrophic cluster, and
a loose group including Cafeteria burkhardae and MAST
species (Fig. S4). A PERMANOVA analysis showed that
22% of the variance in the plot (p < 0.001) was explained by
the trophic mode, and this justiﬁed the use of the IndVal
statistic to this dataset. Among the 28 OGs indicators of the
phagocytosis trophic mode (Table 1), we identiﬁed many
digestive enzymes (peptidases, glycosidases, lipases) and
other genes related to cell growth and responses to the
environment. A larger number of OGs characterized osmo-
trophs (Table S2) and phototrophs (Table S3), 133 and 744
OGs, respectively. In particular, phototrophs displayed many
genes encoding for photosystem and other plastidic proteins.
We focused on a given group of digestive enzymes, the
peptidases, and explored how frequent they were among the
complete set of stramenopile genomes. For this, we selected
the 295 OGs that were functionally annotated as peptidases
or proteases and studied their distribution in the 30 genomes,
both at OGs level (Fig. S5) or after grouping OGs in 71
peptidase families (Fig. 3). These digestive enzymes were
present in all species of phototrophs, osmotrophs, and pha-
gotrophs in roughly similar gene copy numbers, around 250
genes on average per genome. Therefore, the number of
peptidases genes could not be used as indicators of phago-
trophic lifestyle. In the OGs heatmap (Fig. S5), the genomes
clearly grouped by lifestyle (except Blastocystis hominis that
appeared with phagotrophs) and some clusters accumulated
OGs with IndVal scores, so seemed indicative of given
lifestyles. However, in the heatmap constructed with pepti-
dase families (Fig. 3), the grouping of genomes per lifestyle
was less clear and a poor correlation of peptidase types and
trophic mode was observed.

Canonical proton pumps in their role of vacuole
acidiﬁcation
Vacuole acidiﬁcation, a necessary step for the function of
acidic
digestive
enzymes
in
mature
phagosomes,
is
achieved by the action of the proton pump V-ATPase, and
perhaps the V-PPase. We investigated the presence and the
sequence homology of both genes in uncultured MASTs,
other stramenopiles, and several other eukaryotes by phy-
logeny (Fig. 4). We ﬁrst looked for the presence of the
subunits A and B of the V-ATPase complex, which are
homologous to the two subunits of the F-ATPase (Fig. S6).
They were found in all complete genomes investigated here
but were undetected in about half of the MAST species,
most likely due to genome incompleteness. With respect to
V-PPase, these were distributed in the three described
clades: clade 1 homologous to the prokaryotic K+ depen-
dent H+-PPases; clade 2 homologous to the prokaryotic K+
independent H+-PPases; and clade 3 related to the prokar-
yotic K+ dependent Na+ PPases (Fig. S7). Despite genome
incompleteness, MASTs species show a remarkably high
number of V-PPase genes, three on average, often within
the three separate clades. Among them, MAST-4A-sp1,
MAST-4B-sp1, and MAST-4C-sp1 contain a particular
duplication of the clade 2 ancient to the divergence of
the three species (Fig. S7). It is particularly interesting

Comparative genomics reveals new functional insights in uncultured MAST species

the presence of clade 3 V-PPase in MAST species, as
this paralog is often absent in other eukaryotic genomes.
In the stramenopile set studied here, oomycetes, labyr-
inthulomycetes, and the multicellular brown algae Ecto-
carpus appear to have lost clade 3, which is retained only in
some diatoms and C. burkhardae. Finally, only two
MAST species lacked V-PPase genes (MAST-1C-sp1 and
MAST-1D-sp1), and this may likely be due to genome
incompleteness.
Rhodopsins and genes for retinal biosynthesis
Rhodopsins are transmembrane proteins that together with a
retinal pigment use light energy for proton translocation.
Sequence similarity searches conﬁrmed the presence of
rhodopsin-like proteins in 11 of the 15 MAST genomes,
typically found in multiple individual SAGs (Fig. S8). We
carried out a phylogenetic analysis of the full range of
microbial type I rhodopsins including also eukaryotic and
viral sequences. The new MAST rhodopsin proteins were
classiﬁed into distinct phylogenetic branches (Fig. 5). Some
afﬁliated with the xanthorhodopsins type, which were
already known in marine haptophytes, dinoﬂagellates, and
diatoms. Xanthorhodopsins pump ions across cell mem-
branes and contain carotenoid accessory pigments as a light-
harvesting mechanism. With the exception of MAST-3F-
sp1, in which only one of nine cells contained xanthorho-
dopsin (Fig. 5), this coding protein was found in several
cells of MAST-4A-sp1, MAST-4C-sp1, MAST-7B-sp1,
and MAST-9A-sp1. This strongly supports the idea that
these rhodopsins truly belong to MAST species and are not
a product of contamination.
A second clade revealed the presence in MAST species
of the recently identiﬁed MerMAIDs rhodopsins. These
light gated ion channelrhodopsins seem speciﬁc of marine
microbes and were present in MAST-4E-sp1 (in several
cells and featuring two distinct copies), as well as in a
MAST-7B-sp1 cell with moderate bootstrap support (82%).
The amino acid sequences of MAST MerMAIDs aligned
very well with the original reports and revealed a well-
conserved structure (Fig. S9). Similar to other microbial
rhodopsins, it features seven transmembrane helices and the
lysine Schiff base in the seventh helix where the retinal
chromophore typically attaches (Fig. S9). The sequence
from MAST-7B-G22 lacks part of the protein but still
shows the retinal-binding lysine. The remaining MAST
rhodopsins were included in a large bacteriorhodopsin-like
clade. Those from MAST-8B-sp1 and MAST-3F-sp1 were
closer to halorhodopsins (chloride pumps) and sensory
rhodopsins generally limited to halophilic archaea, as well
as to xenorhodopsins (inward H+-directed proton pumps).
Those from MAST-1C-sp1, MAST-1D-sp2, MAST-3A-
sp1, and MAST-3C-sp2 were closer to a large clade
including fungal and bacterial rhodopsins. Our phylogenetic
tree also shows that some species, i.e., MAST-3F-sp1 and
MAST-7B-sp1, encode microbial rhodopsins from different
clades, having putatively different functions. Overall, our
data demonstrate that most of the MAST species studied
here contain rhodopsins and reveal an important hetero-
geneity of this gene.

To broaden this statement, we looked at the expression
level of the rhodopsin genes within the MATOU. Out of the
17 rhodopsin genes identiﬁed in the different MASTs
(Fig. 5), 12 of them corresponded to a MATOU unigene
(>98% similarity in an alignment >600 bp). We investigated
the expression level of these unigenes in surface and deep
chlorophyll maximum (DCM) metatranscriptomes from the
0.8–5 µm size fraction, the fraction where MAST cells are
found (93 metaTs). This revealed that MAST rhodopsins
from the three types were widely expressed in the epipelagic
ocean (Fig. 6). The expression level of xanthorhodopsins
was clearly larger at the surface than at the DCM. For the
other two types, this depth difference was less obvious,
although some bacteriorhodopsins exhibited more expres-
sion at surface than at DCM. Rhodopsin genes for which we
could not demonstrate their expression in the ocean belon-
ged to the three types. Intriguingly, the two genes of
MAST-3F-sp1, a xanthoropdopsin and a bacteriorhodopsin,
were not expressed.
In addition to rhodopsins, we searched for the genes
encoding the retinal biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 7 and
Fig. S8). This pathway starts with the enzyme GGPP
synthase (crtE), the last enzyme involved in isoprenoid
biosynthesis, which produces geranyl2-PP. The next step
involves the synthesis of phytoene from two geranyl2-PP,

Comparative genomics reveals new functional insights in uncultured MAST species
1775
carried out by phytoene synthase (crtB), followed by a
sequential desaturation and isomerization via phytoene
desaturase (crtI) to synthetize lycopene. The enzymes crtE,
crtB, and crtI are present in most of the studied MAST
species and in many of the individual SAGs (Fig. S8).
Synthesis of β-carotene is then catalyzed by the lycopene
cyclase (crtY). The key and ﬁnal step is the oxidative
cleavage of β-carotene into retinal by the enzyme β-carotene
15,15′-dioxygenase (blh). This crucial step was detected in
only a few MASTs, and the previous step partially found in
a single one, which suggests that this pathway is not
functional in MASTs. The gene retinal pigment epithelium-
speciﬁc 65 kDa protein (RPE65), which encodes a protein
for the regeneration of the 11-cis-retinal chromophore of
rhodopsin in vertebrates, has been detected (Fig. S8).
Discussion
Obtaining reliable genomes of uncultured
organisms by SCGs
In marine ecosystems, unicellular planktonic microbes typi-
cally have distinct trophic strategies placed in a trophic con-
tinuum mostly deﬁned by energy transfer, from pure
photosynthesis to prey uptake heterotrophy [57]. An impor-
tant component of the marine plankton, the picoeukaryotes, is
widespread, widely diverse, and includes multiple metabolic
types [58, 59]. To date, the vast majority of heterotrophic
picoeukaryotes cannot be cultured by traditional techniques,
and this prevents the understanding of their functional traits,
as both ecophysiological and genomic studies are not possi-
ble. SCG has proved to be reliable to recover genomic data
from uncultured picoeukaryotes [16, 26, 60], to elucidate viral
infections [61, 62] or phagotrophic interactions [63], and to
highlight new evolutionary insights within animal multi-
cellularity [64]. Here, we used SCG to obtain genome
sequences and infer metabolic capacities of previously inac-
cessible MASTs. The new genomes of 15 MAST species,
obtained by a coassembly strategy [16], showed a complete-
ness often above 50%, higher to what is generally observed
using single cells [65]. From these, we recovered a large
number of predicted proteins per genome, the number of
which generally correlates with genome size and complete-
ness. While this represents a valuable culture-independent
genomic resource, we cannot ignore the technical limitations
of SCG. The necessary step of whole-genome ampliﬁcation
by MDA is well known to produce a patchy recovery of the
original genome, which leads to fragmented and incomplete
sequenced genomes that may affect subsequent analysis [14].
This can be partially alleviated (but not completely) by
coassembling multiple cells. Thus, a gene not detected could
be because it was absent in the genome or because it was lost
during SAG generation and assembly. Nonetheless, we suc-
cessfully provide genomic data from 15 uncharted branches
of the stramenopile radiation, enabling us to access metabolic
features and new physiological capabilities of MAST species.

The placement of the MASTs at the base of the stramenopiles
[7, 8], a phylogenetic region with a large diversity in life
strategies including phagotrophy, osmotrophy, and parasitism,
implies that the trophic roles of MAST species are not
necessarily known. Here, we investigated the putative lifestyle
of a phylogenetically varied set of MAST species using a
recently published model based on comparative genomics
[45]. The model showed evidence that MASTs do not have
the proteins necessary for photosynthesis. Moreover, the
genomic data strongly suggested that most of the MAST
species have the faculty to perform phagocytosis. MAST-3C-
sp2 and MAST-1D-sp1 clustered with photosynthetic eukar-
yotes when the model was trained with the proteins repre-
sentative of phagocytosis, but this was probably due to the
poor genome completeness of both species. In addition, the
model seems unable to differentiate between phagocytotic and
osmotrophic strategies, as osmotrophic species in the original

publication (i.e., oomycetes, see Fig. S1 in [45]) as well as
Hypochytrium and labyrinthulomycetes analyzed here (data
not shown) were predicted to be phagocytotic. The grouping
of osmotrophic genomes excluding MASTs in NMDS plots
with complete gene data suggests that MAST species are
phagotrophs and not osmotrophs. While the essential genes
for photoautotrophy have been well documented either by
comparative genomics or experimentally [66, 67], the iden-
tiﬁcation of core proteins for phagocytosis is much less evi-
dent. Comparative proteomics have suggested a set of about
2000 proteins associated to the phagosomes [68]. However,
the core genes associated to phagocytosis are still difﬁcult to
deﬁne [45] especially because these genes are used across
multiple cellular functions. The assignment of a prototrophic
lifestyle was also part of the model predictions, but we did not
detect a high capacity to synthesize de novo low molecular-
weight essential compounds in any MAST species, which
might further support their dependency on phagocytosis.
Challenges in the quest for exclusive phagotrophic
genetic tool kits: peptidases, as example
As comparative genomics suggested that the MAST species
investigated here were phagotrophs, we focused on genes
putatively participating in the phagocytosis process. A pre-
vious study suggested distinctive functional capacities
among
heterotrophic
picoeukaryotes,
including
some
MASTs, related with glycoside hydrolases [26], here we
emphasized the role of peptidases. As anticipated, peptidases
appeared in every stramenopile genome tested. However,
what was not expected is that both the number of peptidases
per genome or the types of peptidases did not differ among
trophic styles. The weak clustering of species by trophic
strategy based on OGs (Fig. S5) could be due to the fact that
species that share trophic role tend to be closer phylogen-
etically. Thus, the same peptidase family could form dif-
ferent OGs depending on the trophic mode. Correcting this
effect by grouping OGs from the same peptidase family, we
lose any pattern relating peptidases and trophic styles
(Fig. 3). Thus, the amount and types of peptidases were
similar in phagotrophic, phototrophic, and osmotrophic
species. This is in agreement with the fact that all eukaryotic
species contain lysosome-related organelles used in autop-
hagic process that promote the turnover and degradation of
their own proteins. Therefore, it is unlikely to ﬁnd distinct
types of peptidases exclusively associated to phagotrophy.
High presence of V-PPases in MAST genomes
Extending our research toward the vacuole acidiﬁcation, we
focused on two widely known proton pumps: V-ATPases
and V-PPases. V-ATPases are considered to be ubiquitous
components of eukaryotic organisms, typically found in a
single copy per genome, and are the canonical proton pumps
for lysosome acidiﬁcation [49, 69]. Accordingly, V-ATPases
were found in all stramenopiles with complete genomes and
in the majority of MAST species (Fig. 4A), with their
absence likely being explained due to genome incomplete-
ness. V-PPases were initially described as a proton pump
that acidiﬁes the lumen of vacuoles in land plants and
microbial eukaryotes [70, 71]. Their role has been expanded
to the acidiﬁcation of the lumen of acidocalcisomes [20], an
organelle that accumulates polyphosphate, calcium, and
other cationic metals in green and red algae [20, 72] as well
as in trypanosomatid and apicomplexan parasites [73]. A
recent analysis on the evolution of V-PPases showed that
they are absent in opisthokonts and amoebozoans [20], the
eukaryotic supergroups in which most of our understanding
of phagotrophy comes from [74]. In contrast, they are highly
represented in MASTs species. The presence and, in some
cases, concrete expansions of V-PPases in MASTs suggest
an important role of this protein in modulating their cellular
functions. In addition, clade 3 V-PPase seems to be parti-
cularly enriched in MASTs as compared to other strame-
nopiles with different trophic modes. It has been recently
shown that Cafeteria burkhardae upregulates a clade 3 V-
PPase when growing exponentially by bacterivory as com-
pared to the stationary phase [75]. This suggests that these
V-PPases, particularly from clade 3, may exert a key role in
the vacuole acidiﬁcation toward digestion in early-branching
phagotrophic stramenopile clades.
Extensive presence of rhodopsin genes in MAST
genomes
Microbial rhodopsins are a diverse group of photoactive
proteins capable of solar energy usage independent of plastid
photosystems. They act as light-driven ion pumps or light
sensors [76]. Homologs of these seven-helix transmembrane
proteins have been reported in many prokaryotic taxa as well
as in various eukaryotes, including marine species of dia-
toms, dinoﬂagellates [15, 77], haptophytes, cryptophytes
[78], and MAST-4 [27]. Phylogenetic clades with putatively
distinct functions have been identiﬁed [79]. Thus, homologs
of the proton-pumping proteorhodopsins, initially found in
marine bacteria [80], such as bacteriorhodopsins, halorho-
dopsins, sensory rhodopsins, and xanthorhodopsins [81],
have been identiﬁed in archaea, bacteria, protists, and viru-
ses [82]. Other types of microbial rhodopsins include fungal
rhodopsins [83] and, lately, the channelrhodopsins known
for its use in optogenetics [84]. Here, we extend the ﬁnding
of diverse rhodopsins within uncultured MASTs belonging
to distant stramenopile clades.
By themselves, rhodopsins are not photoactive: it is only
when coupled with the light-sensitive retinal chromophore
that they can convert light into an electrical response. The

chromophore binds covalently to the rhodopsin domain
through a Schiff base linkage with a lysine in the middle of
the seventh helix [85], and we observed this conserved
position at the right place in the alignments of MAST
rhodopsins. The pathway of retinal generation involves two
critical steps: the biosynthesis of β-carotene from its pre-
cursor lycopene, and the cleavage β-carotene into retinal
[86]. The early steps of carotenoid biosynthesis to lycopene
were present in MAST species but the genes involved in the
last two critical steps were poorly recovered. This suggests
that MASTs rely on their diet as a constant supply of retinal
as these compounds cannot be synthetized de novo. An
alternative explanation would be that MASTs take advan-
tage of the presence of the RPE65 gene, known to catalyze
the formation of retinal in vertebrates by an alternative
biosynthetic pathway [87, 88].
We identiﬁed rhodopsins in most MAST species. Rho-
dopsins were not found in species with very uncomplete gen-
omes (MAST-1D-sp1 and MAST-C-sp1) and in two species
with an acceptable completeness (MAST-4B-sp1 and MAST-
11-sp1). Particularly intriguing was the absence of rhodopsin in
MAST-4B-sp1, as this gene was present in the other three
MAST-4 species; further work is needed to conﬁrm this
absence. Five MAST species contained xanthorhodopsins, a
subtype of light-driven proton pumps derived from halophilic
bacteria that contain an additional light-harvesting carotenoid
antenna [81]. They formed a highly supported cluster together
with genes of marine haptophytes and dinoﬂagellates [77].
Xanthorhodopsins were the highest expressed rhodopsins in the
ocean, especially in surface waters, suggesting a light depen-
dency. Two species (MAST-4E-sp1 and MAST-7B-sp1) con-
tained MerMAIDs rhodopsins, a new type recently discovered
by metagenomics [51]. The MerMAIDs are closely related to
cation channelrhodopsins but conduct anions, which make
them unique. This is the ﬁrst report of MerMAIDs rhodopsins
in nonphotosynthetic protists. Non-MerMaiD channelrho-
dopsins were found in other stramenopiles such as Hypho-
chytrium
catenoides
[89],
Cafeteria
burkhardae,
Schizochytrium aggregatum, and Aurantiochytrium limacinum
(Fig. 5). Channelrhodopsins are involved in light-sensing
functions such as phototaxis in green algae [90], or even
modulate the colony conformation of a choanoﬂagellate [91].
Thus, these rhodopsins might present a different function than
xanthorhodopsins and bacteriorhodopsins, whose activity as
proton pumps might complement the role of V-ATPase and
potentially V-PPase in acidifying digestive vacuoles [28]. The
fact that we observed a high expression of the xanthorhodopsin
gene in MAST-4A when growing by bacterivory strongly
support this hypothesis [27], but this still needs an experimental
validation. With the observed widespread presence and gene
expression of rhodopsins and the conserved transmembrane
lysine for retinal binding, we suspect that light may play a more
important role for phagotrophic MASTs than we originally
thought. It is also interesting to note that some species harbor
more than one rhodopsin type, suggesting independent acqui-
sitions and complementary roles. Thus, the physiological cap-
abilities
conferred
by
different
rhodopsin
types
might
contribute to the various functions of MASTs in marine eco-
systems. Describing them is the ﬁrst step to create hypothesis
and better understand functional differences between MAST
species and clades.
Conclusion
Due to their inability to be cultured, the physiology and
ecology of many MAST species is still little understood. By
genome sequencing of single eukaryotic cells, we bypassed
cultivation requirements and gained insights into these
neglected
microbial
eukaryotes.
Comparative
genomic
analyses indicated a phagocytotic capability of these
uncultured lineages. Genes clearly involved in phagocy-
tosis, such as proton pumps for vacuole acidiﬁcation and
peptidases for prey digestion, were not exclusive of pha-
gotrophic species and were equally represented in photo-
trophic and osmotrophic species. However, the remarkable
presence of V-PPases and rhodopsins suggests that these
proton pumps might play a crucial role in MAST species.
Besides acidifying food vacuoles, a parallel scenario could
be that MAST species couple rhodopsins proton pumping
with the production of PPi by V-PPases. This coupled
pathway would confer them an alternative energy source, as
occurs in glucose metabolism of the parasitic Entamoeba
histolytica that uses PPi instead of ATP [92]. A better clue
of the involvement of proton pumps, digestive enzymes,
and rhodopsins in phagocytosis is needed and new evi-
dences can be derived from gene expression studies with
cultured species [75] or natural assemblages [27]. Finally,
even though the physiological role of rhodopsins in MASTs
still needs to be elucidated, their ample presence in the
genomes, conserved functional structure, and widespread
expression in the surface ocean suggest that light might play
an unexpected role in phagotrophic MAST species, con-
tributing to vacuole acidiﬁcation, mediating phototaxis, or
even providing alternative energy sources. This light usage
is consistent with the fact that MAST species are restricted
to the upper photic region of the oceans [93, 94]. Overall,
our data reveal a high metabolic plasticity of the MAST
species analyzed here, which might facilitate their existence
in the oceans as very abundant bacterial grazers.
