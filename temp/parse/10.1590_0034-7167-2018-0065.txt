Validation of a clinical simulation setting in the management of postpartum haemorrhage
Andrade PON, Oliveira SC, Morais SCRV, Guedes TG, Melo GP, Linhares FMP.
INTRODUCTION
Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) affects approximately 2% of 
all women in the puerperal period. PPH is associated with ap-
proximately one-quarter of all maternal deaths worldwide and 
has contributed to severe maternal morbidity and prolonged 
disability through association with more substantial blood loss, 
including progression to shock and organic dysfunction(1). 
Midwife nurses, most of times, are who first identify and initi-
ate PPH treatment. Thus, increase in quality and number of the 
nursing professional’s qualifications translates into benefits for 
the patient(2).  The clinical simulation technique has been used 
as an important teaching tool and active methodology to be 
used in training of nurses and in Permanent Education of health 
professionals. This technique has been increasingly used because 
it is an important  training resource for these professionals, so 
that they can develop skills, and communication, health care, 
decision-making and leadership abilities, being essential to 
resolution of the exposed clinical situation(3).
Thus, the use of clinical simulation presents itself as a viable 
teaching strategy to prepare students and professionals in the 
setting of care practice. It can be used even in the academic and 
hospital environment. Simulation allows health professionals 
to identify behaviors that need improvement by offering the 
opportunity to practice and develop skills in a non-threatening 
environment away from patient care since stress and anxiety can 
increase the chances of error not acceptable in actual practice. 
Techniques referring to resuscitation and stabilization should 
be dominated for hospital practice aiming to improve the per-
formance of students and professionals(4). Clinical simulation 
in Obstetrical Nursing improved care provision to the vulner-
able population and contributed to reduce the morbidity and 
mortality rates associated with preeclampsia and eclampsia or 
other emergencies(5). 
In PPH care, training using clinical simulation improved real-
time blood loss estimates and allowed learners to detect and 
treat early because they avoid underestimation of blood loss and 
treatment is postponed(3). This teaching methodology has also 
shown potential in emergency management with pre-eclampsia 
and eclampsia. It positively affects efficacy of nurses in the treat-
ment of this obstetric urgency; in addition to suggesting that 
the management of other high risk and low incidence obstetric 
emergencies can also be improved(5). 
In this sense, the clinical simulation script construction in the 
management of PPH is able to strengthen the theory/practice 
relationship and contribute to the training of more critical and 
reflexive nurses, developing skills and abilities in the care of 
women with PPH. To do so, it is necessary to validate a simula-
tion setting by expert judges and target public; since it must be 
ensured that it has integrity, reproducibility and is in line with 
the recommended standards for the clinical simulation setting’s 
construction. 
OBJECTIVE
This study aims to build and validate clinical simulation set-
ting for PPH.
METHODS
Ethical aspects
Ethical precepts established by Resolution 466/2012 and 
506/16 of the National Health Council were followed, so that 
the proposal of the study was appreciated and approved by 
the Research Ethics Committee Involving Human Beings of the 
Universidade Federal de Pernambuco. 
Design, place of study and period
This is a methodological research for the construction and 
validation of a setting of clinical simulation in the management 
of PPH, carried out from May to July, 2016. Simulation setting was 
constructed after surveying contents from the literature, and was 
based on the judgment of expert judges and target audience that 
analyzed representativeness of the content and its adequacy (6).
Population or sample, criteria of inclusion and exclusion
The criteria established for the selection of judges were 
adapted from those proposed by Fehring. Judges whose profes-
sional profile was compatible with a minimum score of 7 points(7). 
Criteria: have a doctorate in nursing or related areas = 4; Master’s 
Degree in nursing or related areas = 4; dissertation in the area of 
Women’s Health/Obstetrics/simulation = 1; articles published in 
one of the cited areas = 2; practice or teaching in one of the areas 
= 2; and specialization in the area of Women’s Health/Obstetrics 
= 2. All judges had at least specialization.
Sample was determined by the use of calculation formula based 
on proportion(8). Sample size was calculated from formula: N= 
Zα². P (1-P)/ e2. Where: N= sample size; P = proportion of judges 
(85%); e = proportional difference acceptable in relation to what 
would be expected (15%); Zα = 1.96 (95% desired confidence); 
obtaining a final sample of 22 specialists/students. 22 judges and 
30 students participated in the nursing course/UFPE.
Selection of judges was for convenience, carried out by the 
Lattes Platform of the curriculum of researchers, available in the 
Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 
(CNPq - National Council for Scientific and Technological Develop-
ment) portal. Inclusion criteria of students were: to have studied 
nursing in women’s health, be 18 years old or older. Exclusion 
criteria were: students with training in related areas that allows 
a prior preparation in the management of PPH. The criterion of 
choice was the use of intentional non-probabilistic sampling(6).
An electronic form was created with the help of Google Forms®; 
and was sent by e-mail to judges after initial contact, composed of 
invitation letter, Free Informed Consent Form and a form containing: 
characterization form, setting script, and content and appearance 
validation form. For students, forms were in printed form, which 
were delivered and collected personally by the researcher. Valida-
tion form was built by authors. Evaluation carried out by judges 
contained three categories: objective, structure, presentation and 
relevance. The one performed by the target audience has five 
domain categories: objectives, organization, writing style, appear-
ance and motivation. Each category was analyzed using the Likert

scale(9), with five levels of responses: I totally agree, I partially agree, 
I neither agree nor disagree, I partially disagree, I totally disagree. 
Study protocol
A survey of the contents was carried out by searching the 
literature for specific books on the subject, scientific articles and 
recommendations from World Health Organization (WHO) for 
PPH prevention and treatment (2014)(1); textual elaboration of 
the setting script following a pre-established model(10-11). 
Following the pre-built model(10-11), the first step was to de-
termine the learning objective. To this end, it was established 
that the nurse/student could adequately and in a team conduct 
the care of a puerperal patient with PPH. The activity included: 
identifying puerperae with blood loss greater than 500 ml with 
clinical signs of hypovolemic shock and/or greater than 1000 ml, 
with or without clinical signs of hypovolemic shock; enabling 
PPH protocol; identifying and correcting the pathway laceration 
and hypotonic uterus, causes of hemorrhage; and recording the 
nursing process in medical records. 
The second step was to include in the simulation a clinical case, 
with physiological responses to each intervention of students. A 
low fidelity manikin was used, with the use of the female pelvis 
that allowed visualization of the vulva and vaginal introitus. 
Simulation was performed in a place of the delivery room setting. 
Three participants were selected and named team members: one 
nursing technician and two nurses; it was established that simula-
tion had an estimated duration of 20 minutes, being classified as 
of medium complexity, according to the clinical case’s complexity. 
The third step, in the setting construction, an assessment/resolution 
tool of problems was constructed: after presentation of the clinical 
picture, students were asked to provide patient care. Scenes were 
developed and skills and abilities expected during the simulation 
were set. Thus, a checklist was created to evaluate actions performed 
according to: communication, physical examination, signs and 
symptoms, monitoring and nursing process recording, Chart 1.

The fourth step was to establish prerequisites for participa-
tion in the simulation and support needed by students. As it is 
a specific nursing care it was established that for participation 
in the simulation, students should attend a class on the subject 
beforehand and be aware of the physiology and anatomy of labor, 
delivery and immediate puerperium; read the treatment protocol 
for PPH; knowledge of biosafety resources and materials used. Two 
“actors” made part of the setting in order to help clarify the clinical 
situation. One made the patient’s voice and the other performed 
a nurse technician who informed, when requested, the patient’s 
clinical signs. A script with actor dialogues and participant (nurse) 
of the simulation was elaborated to ensure information quality 
during the setting development, as shown in Chart 2.
The fifth step in the setting was the debriefing construction, 
conducted after the simulation with all participants. Issues related 
to self-assessment about care, feelings about the situation lived, 
skills developed, a reflection of the positives and opportunities 
for improvement. 
Analysis of results, and statistics
Data collected in the validation stage were analyzed by the 
IBM® SPSS® Statistics, version 20.0, describing the absolute, mean 
and Standard Deviation. For content validation, the Binomial Test(9) 
was applied to each item of the form, verifying the proportion 
of agreement between judges, with an agreement ratio equal 
to or greater than 85% (P≥85%) and a significance level (α) of 
5%. Thus, p-values greater than 0.05 indicate the proportion 
of judges who agreed with the adequacy and relevance of the 
simulation setting(8).       
For analysis in relation to the degree of agreement of items, 
Content Validity Index was calculated by means of three mathemati-
cal equations: I-CVI (Item-level Contente Validity Index), S-CVI/
AVE (Scale-level Contente Validity Index, Averange Calculation 
Method) e S-CVI (Scale-level Contente Validity Index). The item 
that obtained a mean of 0.80 or greater was considered as desired 
in the validation(6). For students’ analysis understanding of the 
simulation route, the calculation of the I-CVI was also performed 
for each item of the appearance validation form.

RESULTS
Regarding the content validation process, of the 22 judges, the 
majority had assisting experience in Women’s Health/Obstetrics 
(n=19), and teaching experience (n=21) in higher education 
institutions. Three had experience with clinical simulation and 
specialization in emergency and adult emergency. All judges 
were female (n=22). Mean age was 45.4 years (SD+9.3 years). 
The mean time of training was 35.3 years (SD 7.7 years), with 
teaching time of 7.8 years (SD+8.1 years). Of those who worked 
in care, all had specialization in Women’s Health/Obstetrics and 
Master’s Degree.
Agreement between judges for the evaluated items was 
satisfactory. P value was> 0.05 in the 23 items, indicating the pro-
portion of judges agreeing with the adequacy and pertinence of 
the clinical simulation setting. All items in the objective, structure, 
presentation and relevance categories were satisfactorily evalu-
ated. There was no need to adjust the content of the roadmap 
to achieve the proposed objectives.
Items agreement expressed by the I-CVI calculation, separately, 
can be visualized in Table 1. It is verified that the I-CVI value was 
greater than 0.90 in all evaluated items. I-CVI mean for clinical 
simulation setting was 0.97. Agreement ratio (S-CVI/AVE) was 
above 0.91 for all judges. S-CVI value was 0.976 (Table 1).

DISCUSSION 
Deaths from PPH are caused by delays in identification and 
diagnosis. Teams need to be able to intervene early in order to 
reduce maternal morbidity and mortality(1). Thus, clinical simula-
tion on PPH construction will take knowledge in a dynamic and 
interactive way, in order to provoke reflections that lead to the 
change of student/professional behavior when exposed to this 
situation in the practice of care. 
Impact of training through clinical simulations is significant in 
reducing maternal mortality because it ensures that all profes-
sionals caring for women during childbirth have the opportunity 
to learn the skills and abilities needed to manage PPH(12). The 
use of clinical simulation in the context of education demands 
well-planned and structured criteria, with suitable methodol-
ogy, trained professionals and efficient resources so that the 
established objectives are achieved. Taking into consideration 
the study setting construction, similar steps were used in the 
setting construction for the PPH management in UK, whose 
development phases were: selection of simulator and environ-
ment, determination of duration of simulation, construction of a 
study and an evaluation tool, which was applied before and after 
simulation. However, such a setting that was built systematically 
did not have its content validated(13). 
For the simulation success, it is important that the setting is 
based on the learning objectives(14). When the objectives of the 
teaching strategy and the setting are well delimited and clear, the 
student can be given a clinical setting with consistent informa-
tion that will close the gaps in practice. This clarity will allow a 
final result with a better performance of the future professionals 
and, consequently, a better care(5). In this study, the first step in 
setting development was to determine the learning objective.
Thus, the definition of objectives and contents, in a clear 
and defined way in the simulation setting, allowed the health 
professional to identify the actions that need improvement, 
offering the opportunity to practice and develop skills, in a safe 
environment, far from care to the patient. Stress and anxiety are 
reduced, which increase the chances of error(4). 
It is necessary to establish guidelines for clinical simulation, 
since little evidence currently exists to guide professors who 
choose to use this teaching methodology(15). However, there 
is a growing concern about the construction of settings for 
simulated practice, since the absence of a pedagogical roadmap 
for construction poses a threat to the effectiveness of clinical 
simulation. The setting was constructed to represent a delivery 
room to express realism, as identified in other studies that either 
used the delivery room itself or developed the simulation in an 
environment very similar to the real one(2-3,13).
In the process of construction of the setting, aspects were 
considered to motivate the reading and the learning of students. 
The setting can be considered very elaborate and realistic when 
it allows the subject a physical evaluation, training of technical 
skills and critical thinking in relation to the simulated situation. 
Thus, as observed in a performance evaluation list in clinical 
simulation, developed based on technical skills, knowledge and 
management in teams(2). In view of this, judges were asked about 
the structure and presentation of the script. All agreed on the 
suitability of the material for undergraduates, also regarding the 
clarity of the language used and presentation and organization 
of the data (I-CVI=1.00). 
Judges’ agreement on the construction of knowledge, based 
on the setting, was satisfactory, which proved to be adequate to 
the use of the same in the construction of knowledge on PPH. 
All students fully agreed that the scenario proposes knowl-
edge on the subject through the use of active methodology. 
It is essential for the student to perceive the relevance and 
application of what is being taught and to be attracted to the 
educational material. The material should arouse interest in 
knowing something, when referring to real and meaningful 
situations for professional life(8).

All judges and students agreed that the setting could be used 
by health professionals or educators during PPH training. Periodic 
training with clinical simulation improves the performance of 
bimanual uterine compression and significantly improves the 
accuracy of blood loss estimation(12). It is important to point 
out that clinical simulation is a feature to be used in nursing’s 
Permanent Education as well. In addition, nurses acquire the 
necessary skills to assist obstetric patients in critical situations. 
Health professionals must pay attention to the needs of their 
target audience, using playful and realistic means that favor the 
interest and understanding of the subject. Thus, in the written 
communication process, textual elaboration must be suitable to 
the educational and cultural level of the target audience to be 
benefited by the educational material constructed(15-16).
Regarding the validation process of content and appear-
ance of this study, this was done through a tool with three 
categories of domains: objective, structure, presentation and 
relevance. Another study carried out the validation of a clinical 
simulation evaluation tool through relevance, clarity and fea-
sibility. The tool was built in a checklist consisting of 20 items 
that maintain vital information, communication, feedback and 
communication behaviors(15).
Content validation provided scientific recognition of the 
simulation setting, based on the judgment of expert judges, as 
observed in another study(15). Judges agreed that the setting 
content promotes the construction of knowledge and considered 
appropriate the method for the use by health and education 
professionals. Coherence between content and objective had a 
satisfactory score, just like the logical sequence of the proposed 
content, a fact that indicates that the information contained in 
the setting is appropriate. In addition, the agreement with the 
information contained in the setting covers well the content and 
is important for the quality of care provided(17). 
Study limitations 
There was a limitation of this study on the difficulty of judges 
to respond in a timely manner.
Contributions to the fields of Nursing, Health or Public Policy
Trainings based on clinical simulation are part of a proactive 
and appropriate approach to reduce errors and risks in Obstetrics 
by improving teamwork and giving students a multiplicity of 
skills and abilities to improve their performance.
Moreover, because it is an educational strategy, it will en-
able educators an innovative way to exchange knowledge with 
students and health professionals, provide the construction and 
reconstruction of knowledge, bring learning opportunities, and 
contribute to education advancement.
CONCLUSION
The validated clinical simulation setting was relevant and 
presented as a new teaching material of activities with nursing 
students in the discipline Women’s Health/Obstetrics, with the 
objective of motivating students in the process of teaching learning, 
strengthening the theory/practice relationship, contributing to 
the training of more critical and reflexive nurses, and developing 
skills and abilities in the care of women with PPH. However, other 
studies should be carried out in order to test the effectiveness in 
increasing theoretical and practical knowledge of both nursing 
students and nurses during Permanent Education.
