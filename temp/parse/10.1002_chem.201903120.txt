Abstract: Systematic variation of the 1,4-dioxane (dx) con-
centration during the precipitation of sparingly soluble
[MgBr2(dx)2] from ethereal Grignard solutions of RMgBr has
allowed
the
structural
investigation
of
crystallized
[R2Mg(dx)n] (n=1, 1.5, 2, and 3), which form during this diox-
ane method, depending on the bulkiness of R. The number-
ing of the complexes explored in this study is based on the
number n of dioxane molecules per magnesium atom, fol-
lowed by the substituent R; an apostrophe denotes coordi-
nation polymers. The following derivatives were studied by
X-ray crystal-structure determination and NMR spectroscopy:
n=1: [Me2Mg(m-dx)]1 (1’-Me) and [nPr2Mg(m-dx)]1 (1’-nPr);
n=1.5: [{iPr2Mg(dx)}2(m-dx)] (1.5-iPr), [{oTol2Mg(dx)}2(m-dx)]
(1.5-oTol), and [(Me3Si-CC)2Mg(dx)1.5]1 (1.5’-C2SiMe3); n=2:
[tBu2Mg(dx)2]
(2-tBu)
and
[oTol2Mg(dx)2]
(2-oTol);
n=3:
[Ph2Mg(dx)3] (3-Ph). In the structure types 1’, 1.5, and 2, the
magnesium atom exhibits the coordination number 4,
whereas pentacoordinate metal atoms are observed in types
3 and 1.5’. The structure type 2’ is realized for [(Ph-C
C)2Mg(dx)2]1
(2’-C2Ph),
[MgCl2(dx)2]1
(2’-Cl),
and
[MgBr2(dx)2]1 (2’-Br) with hexacoordinate metal atoms. The
solubility of the dioxane adducts in common organic sol-
vents strongly depends on the degree of aggregation with
the solubility decreasing from molecular to strand to layer
structures.
Introduction
Grignard reagents, namely organylmagnesium halides, can be
straightforwardly synthesized by the reduction of halohydro-
carbons with magnesium turnings (direct synthesis).[1] In solu-
tion, complex and solvent-dependent equilibria interconvert
mono- and oligonuclear species leading to mixtures of RMgX,
MgR2, and MgX2; a simplified picture is shown in Scheme 1.
There has been great interest in halide-free di(hydrocarbyl)-
magnesium compounds for several decades.[1,2] Besides the
direct synthesis (yielding Grignard reagents), hydromagnesia-
tion of alkenes with activated magnesium hydride[3] and the
THF method by the precipitation of sparingly soluble Mg(thf)6I2
from RMgI solutions[4] have allowed, in special cases, the isola-
tion of MgR2. However, an approved and reliable procedure for
the removal of magnesium halides from Grignard solutions,
discovered by Schlenk 90 years ago, was realized by the addi-
tion of 1,4-dioxane (dx, the dioxane method), as depicted in
Scheme 2.[5]

Diverse observations led to refined procedures for the diox-
ane method. It proves to be very beneficial to allow the MgX2-
containing precipitate to age overnight at room temperature.
The solid is then less voluminous and more compact, which
allows a less time-consuming removal by filtration. During this
time, initially trapped MgR2 dissolves, which enhances the
yield of diorganylmagnesium. During solvate formation, diox-
ane competes with the Lewis basic solvent L of the Grignard
reaction, the donor strength of the ethers increasing in the
order Et2O !thfdx. Consequently, the precipitation of mag-
nesium halides from diethyl ether solutions is nearly quantita-
tive and application of a very small excess of 1,4-dioxane is suf-
ficient, whereas in THF solution even a large excess of dx still
leads to incomplete removal of MgX2. Dioxane molecules can
coordinate to metal cations through three different binding
modes: The chair conformation enables h1-terminal as well as
m-O,O’-bridging coordination modes, whereas the boat confor-
mation with an h2-O,O’-chelating binding mode is as yet un-
known in organomagnesium chemistry. The filtrate contains di-
organylmagnesium complexes [R2Mg(dx)n], but the use of very
bulky R groups can lead to soluble RMgX(dx)n compounds,
showing that the Schlenk equilibrium is not always quantita-
tively shifted toward the homoleptic congeners.[6] Ten years
ago, the influence of dioxane on the Schlenk equilibrium was
studied more explicitly.[7] Further examples of dioxane adducts
of diorganylmagnesium are known and have been structurally
authenticated.[8] These compounds are depicted in Scheme 3.
The compounds are labeled considering the number n of
1,4-dioxane ligands, with an apostrophe symbolizing coordina-
tion polymers, followed by the hydrocarbyl group R. Thus, 1’-
Me characterizes [Me2Mg(m-dx)]1. Besides mononuclear com-
plexes of the type [R2Mg(h1-dx)2] (2-R with R=Mes,[7] 2-
MeC2B10H10,[9]
and
C9H7
(indenyl)[10]),
dinuclear
congeners
[{R2Mg(dx)}2(m-dx)] (type 1.5-R with R=Bz[7]) have also been in-
vestigated. Strand-like structures such as [R2Mg(m-dx)]1 (type
1’-R with R=Et,[8a] CH2tBu,[8b] iPr,[8c] Ph,[8d] Cy,[7] and Cp[11]) with
bridging dioxane ligands are observed in most cases in the
crystalline
state.
The
mononuclear
silanide
complex
[{(Me3Si)2MeSi}2Mg(dx)2] of type 2,[12] the strand-like magnesiate
[LiMg(CH2SiMe3)3(m-dx)(h1-dx)]1,[13] and the tetranuclear hetero-
scorpionate
complex
[{L(MgCH2SiMe3)2}2(m-dx)]
expand
this
class of dioxane adducts.[14] Furthermore, mononuclear molecu-
lar congeners [MgR2] without co-ligands can be stabilized with
very
bulky
groups
such
as
C(SiMe3)3
and
2,4,6-tBu3C6H2
(Mes*).[15]
To systematically investigate the coordination chemistry of
dioxane adducts of organomagnesium complexes, we chose
simple hydrocarbyl groups without additional heteroatoms.
The di(hydrocarbyl)magnesium derivatives were studied in so-
lution and in the crystalline state, depending on the dioxane
concentration as well as the size and nature of the hydrocarbyl
group R. Thus, we varied the following parameters:
1) The chain length of aliphatic carbanions (R=Me, Et, nPr,
and nBu),
2) The degree of substitution of aliphatic carbanions (R=Me,
Et, iPr, and tBu),
3) The steric demand of aromatic carbanions (R=Ph, oTol,
Mes, and Mes*),
4) Slim di(alkynyl)magnesium–dioxane adducts (R=CC-Ph,
CC-SiMe3).
This selection of organic ligands has allowed us to elucidate
the influence of steric pressure and hybridization, because the
organic groups R encompass sp3- (alkyl), sp2- (aryl), and sp-hy-
bridized (alkynyl) anionic carbon atoms. Furthermore, various
molar ratios of MgR2/dx were employed during the crystalliza-
tion procedures.
Results and Discussion
n-Alkylmagnesium–dioxane adducts
We first studied the effect of the chain length of alkyl groups
on the properties and molecular structures of [R2Mg(dx)n] after
precipitation and removal of the magnesium halides. The sim-
plest derivative is dimethylmagnesium.[16] Isolation of this com-
pound succeeded by the precipitation of magnesium bromide
with 1,4-dioxane in commercially available solutions of methyl-
magnesium bromide in THF. After removal of the solvents, the
sparingly soluble residue was recrystallized from a mixture of
toluene and 1,4-dioxane to yield colorless and highly pyro-
phoric crystals of the coordination polymer [Me2Mg(m-dx)]1
(1’-Me) depicted in Figure 1.
The crystal structure consists of parallel zigzag chains of
MgMe2 units bridged by dioxane ligands with chair conforma-
tions. The dx ligands are arranged in a face-to-face manner.
This arrangement leads to a zigzag chain with a larger ampli-
tude than observed for the coordination polymers of the type
[R2Mg(m-dx)]1 with R=Et, Ph, Cy, and iPr. The Mg···Mg distance

of 889.14(3) pm between the first and third MgMe2 moieties in
1’-Me is significantly smaller than in other magnesium conge-
ners
of
this
type
with
values
of
approximately
1150–
1240 pm.[17] In all these complexes the magnesium-bound dx
ligands with chair conformations are arranged back-to-back
(Scheme 4). The nonbonding Mg···Mg distance of 690.5(2) pm
between neighboring magnesium atoms is determined by the
dx ligands and is very similar for all derivatives with a strand
structure.[18] Due to the larger spacing of the MgR2 units with
dioxane ligands arranged back-to-back, this is the favored
structure for larger R groups.
Complex 1’-Me is only very sparingly soluble in diethyl
ether, but readily dissolves in THF and is soluble in warm 1,4-
dioxane. From a pure dioxane solution, again strand-like 1’-Me
crystallized and a complex containing more dioxane was not
observed. The NMR spectra in [D8]THF solution show the reso-
nances for the magnesium-bound methyl groups at d(1H)=
1.82 ppm and d(13C)=16.5 ppm (1JC,H=105.6 Hz). In this
solvent, the strand structure is deaggregated by the substitu-
tion of dx ligands by THF Lewis bases.
The addition of 1,4-dioxane to an ethereal solution of ethyl-
magnesium bromide and removal of the precipitated magnesi-
um bromides yielded the known strand structure [Et2Mg(m-
dx)]1 (1’-Et).[8a] This compound is only soluble in diethyl ether
or benzene if dioxane has been added. The strand structure
[Et2Mg(m-dx)]1 crystallized again from a solvent mixture of di-
oxane and diethyl ether (ratio of 5:1).
The dioxane adduct of di(n-propyl)magnesium is soluble in
diethyl ether and this complex crystallized again within several
days from a 2.0m solution of dioxane and diethyl ether (ratio
of dx and Et2O of approx. 1:1) at 408C to yield colorless crys-
tals of [nPr2Mg(m-dx)]1 (1’-nPr), as shown in Figure 2.
The crystal structure of 1’-nPr also consists of parallel zigzag
chains of (nPr)2Mg moieties bridged by 1,4-dioxane bases.
However, the dioxane ligands show a face-to-back arrange-
ment, as depicted in Scheme 4. In comparison with 1’-Me, this

orientation of the dx ligands leads to an elongation of the dis-
tance between the first and third magnesium atoms to
1080.96(8) pm. The nonbonding Mg1···Mg1A distance between
neighboring magnesium atoms is 698.7(1) pm.
Contrary to the shorter n-alkyl complexes, (nBu)2Mg did not
crystallize from a 4.0m ethereal solution at 408C. At 788C
and upon layering with n-pentane, an amorphous solid with
the composition [nBu2Mg(dx)] precipitated. The longer alkyl
groups significantly enhances the solubility in ethereal sol-
vents, thereby causing a deterioration in its crystallization be-
havior. Probably, the longer alkyl groups do not fit as well be-
tween the chains and smaller degrees of aggregation are real-
ized.
1,4-Dioxane adducts of (Me3xHxC)2Mg
We next investigated the effect of the degree of substitution
on
the
molecular
structures
of
the
dx
adducts
of
(Me3xHxC)2Mg (x=3: Me; 2: Et; 1: iPr; 0: tBu). The simplest
magnesium complex with secondary alkyl groups is di(isopro-
pyl)magnesium, [iPr2Mg(m-dx)]1 (1’-iPr), which has already
been studied by Blasberg et al.[8c] Another complex with a
larger dx content was accessible during crystallization in a
more dioxane-rich solution of isopropylmagnesium chloride;
the molecular structure of this derivative, [{iPr2Mg(dx)}2(m-dx)]
(1.5-iPr), is depicted in Figure 3.
The structure is of type 1.5 and the MgC and MgO bond
lengths are of the same order of magnitude as those observed
for the strand structure.[8c] Contrary to this finding, the bond
angles show significant differences. Thus, the CMgC bond
angles of 128.7(1) and 130.4(1)8 are larger than the value of
122.19(9)8 in the strand structure, and the OMgO angles of
99.90(7) and 99.68(7)8 are more acute in comparison with the
OMgO bond angle of 104.37(7)8 in [iPr2Mg(m-dx)]1 (1’-iPr).
Thus, for the complexes with bulky isopropyl groups, two
structures, 1’ and 1.5, are observed depending on the dioxane
concentration in the mother liquor, whereas for the n-propyl
congeners the coordination polymer 1’ with exclusively bridg-
ing dioxane ligands seems to be favored.
To further increase the bulkiness of the alkyl group, we stud-
ied the tert-butylmagnesium complex. After precipitation and
removal of [MgCl2(dx)2] from an ethereal solution of tert-butyl-
magnesium chloride we crystallized [tBu2Mg(h1-dx)2] (2-tBu).
The structure of this compound is depicted in Figure 4.
This complex is the fifth derivative of type 2. This structure
type forms with sterically demanding groups and in the pres-
ence of a moderate excess of 1,4-dioxane during crystallization.
The MgC bond lengths of dialkylmagnesium increase in the
order primary (213–215 pm) < secondary (214–216 pm) <
tertiary alkyl groups (216–218 pm), whereas the CMgC bond
angles show no clear trend.
The crystalline 2-tBu partially loses ligated dioxane during
the drying process in vacuo. We did not isolate this dioxane-
poor congener, but structures of tert-butylmagnesium com-
plexes with dioxane ligands have already been observed in the
heteroleptic [L2{Mg(tBu)}4(m-dx)2], in which L is a bidentate
bridging
ligand,
and
in
the
trinuclear
compound
[(thf)Mg(tBu)2(m-dx)Mg(tBu)LMg(tBu)].[19]
Structures of [Ar2Mg(dx)n] with increasing hindrance at the
ortho-substituted phenyl groups
The coordination polymer [Ph2Mg(m-dx)]1 (1’-Ph) is insoluble in
toluene. The addition of 1,4-dioxane to this suspension led to
a clear solution. Cooling of this solution again yielded the
starting [Ph2Mg(m-dx)]1 (1’-Ph). Dissolution of these crystals in
pure dioxane gave another complex that is highly soluble in
dx. The clear crystals of this complex turned dull after isolation
and removal of the mother liquor. The molecular structure of
this
dioxane
adduct,
[Ph2Mg(dx)3]
(3-Ph),
is
depicted
in

The t parameter, which is an indicator of the geometry of
pentacoordinate metal complexes, can be calculated according
to the equation t=(ba)/608 (in which b is the largest and a
the second largest bond angle at the metal center) with t=1
for an ideal trigonal bipyramid and t=0 for a square pyra-
mid.[20] For 3-Ph, a t value of 0.66 was elucidated, which is
much closer to a trigonal-bipyramidal coordination sphere
with O1 and O5 in apical positions (O1Mg1O5 164.68(4)8).
Deviation from a linear arrangement is enforced by the steric
repulsion between these dioxane ligands and the phenyl
groups. The equatorial plane contains the ipso-carbon atoms
C1 and C7 and the Lewis base O3 (angle sum=359.73(5)8).
The higher coordination number of the magnesium atom in 3-
Ph leads to elongated MgC and MgO bonds (MgC
217.19(14)
and
216.01(13) pm,
MgOaxial
224.51(11)
and

the strand structure [Ph2Mg(m-dx)]1 (1’-Ph; MgC 213.5(2) pm,
MgO 208.1(2) and 206.1(2) pm) with tetracoordinate metal
atoms.
The type 2 diphenylmagnesium complex [Ph2Mg(dx)2] is un-
known even though Bickelhaupt and co-workers were able to
prepare the corresponding THF adduct [Ph2Mg(thf)2].[2a]
Ortho substitution with methyl groups increases the steric
requirements of the aryl groups and a coordination number of
5 could not be achieved. Consequently, addition of dioxane to
an ethereal solution of o-tolylmagnesium bromide and removal
of [MgBr2(dx)2] allowed the crystallization and isolation of
[(oTol)2Mg(dx)2] (2-oTol) but not a strand-like structure of type
1’ as found for diphenylmagnesium. The molecular structure of
2-oTol is depicted in Figure 6.
Whereas the magnesium atom in the phenyl derivative 3-Ph
has a coordination number of 5, the bulkier oTol group only
allows tetracoordinate magnesium centers. The MgC bond
lengths in the distorted tetrahedral complexes of type 2 in-
crease with increasing steric pressure in the order phenyl
(213.5(2) pm)<o-tolyl
(214.9(2)–215.6(2) pm)<2,4,6-trimethyl-
phenyl (mesityl, 216.7(2) pm).[7] The CMgC bond angles vary
from 117.55(9)8 (Mes) to 123.96(8)8 (Ph) to 124.39(9)8 (oTol).
The complex [(oTol)2Mg(dx)2] (2-oTol) is soluble in warm tol-
uene. From this solution, tetracoordinate type 1.5 magnesium
centers were also accessible. The molecular structure of
[{(oTol)2Mg(dx)}2(m-dx)] (1.5-oTol) is shown in Figure 7. The o-
methyl substituents are disordered but crystallization as a type
1.5 complex was verified unequivocally. The two magnesium
atoms are in distorted tetrahedral environments with a bridg-
ing dx ligand.
Dimesitylmagnesium
(bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)magnesium)
crystallized as [Mes2Mg(dx)2] (2-Mes) from an ethereal solution
of mesitylmagnesium bromide after addition of 1,4-dioxane
and removal of magnesium bromide.[7] Furthermore, the struc-
ture of 2-Mes is comparable to the structures of the thf ad-
ducts of dimesityl- ([Mes2Mg(thf)2]) and bis(2,4,6-triisopropyl-
phenyl)magnesium ([Trip2Mg(thf)2]).[21] Contrary to this finding,
bis[2,4,6-tri(tert-butyl)phenyl]magnesium forms no stable ad-
ducts with tetrahydrofuran.[15b]

After the investigation of di(hydrocarbyl)magnesium com-
plexes with sp3- (alkyl) and sp2-hybridized (aryl) carbon atoms,
we also studied congeners with an sp-hybridized carbon atom.
Compounds of the type [(R-CC)2Mg(dx)n] (n=1.5 (SiMe3) and
2 (Ph)) are nearly insoluble in diethyl ether, dioxane, and tolu-
ene, but soluble in THF. From such a solution, [(Ph-C

C)2Mg(thf)4] was isolated with a distorted octahedral environ-
ment of the magnesium center.[22]
For solubility reasons we prepared an alkynyl complex by
the deprotonation of trimethylsilylacetylene with [nPr2Mg(m-
dx)]1 (1’-nPr) in excess dioxane to yield a compound with the
composition [(Me3Si-CC)2Mg(dx)1.5]. This complex is soluble in
THF but only very sparingly soluble in dioxane and insoluble in
hydrocarbons, which is quite unique for a complex of type 1.5.
The 13C{1H} NMR spectrum shows two characteristic resonances
at d=112.1 and 158.5 ppm for the ethynyl fragment. To grow
single crystals of this complex we stored a mixture of
[nBu2Mg(m-dx)] (1-nBu) and trimethylsilylacetylene in 1,4-diox-
ane at 58C. This procedure allowed the slow crystallization of
[(Me3Si-CC)2Mg(dx)1.5]1 (1.5’-C2SiMe3), but the crystal quality
was very poor. Therefore, we could only elucidate a structural
motif. The structure is depicted in Figure 8.
Despite poor crystal quality and a substandard data set, the
structural motif was deduced unequivocally and revealed the
solid-state structure. The pentacoordinate magnesium atoms
are embedded in trigonal-bipyramidal environments with the
alkynyl groups in apical positions. The 1,4-dioxane ligands with
chair conformations occupy equatorial positions and act as
bridging ligands between magnesium atoms, leading to a
layer structure. As a consequence of this packing, the magnesi-
um atoms form a layer structure of regular six-membered
rings. The alkynyl ligands are bound above and below the
layer and establish borders between two layers. Okuda and co-
workers[23] determined the structure of [(all)2Mg(thf)(m-dx)]1
(all=allyl); the slim allyl groups here would have also allowed
the formation of a layer structure, but two-dimensional (2D)
binding is prevented by the presence of the thf ligands instead
of dx molecules. Therefore, a strand structure is observed in
the crystalline state. A 2D network was found for the heterobi-
metallic compound [{M(all)3Mg(all)2}2(m-dx)5]1 with M=Y and
La.[24] In [(Me3Si-CC)2Mg(thf)4], all the dx ligands are substitut-
ed by thf ligands leading to the breakup of the coordination
polymer to yield discrete molecular complexes with hexacoor-
dinate magnesium atoms.[25]
The metalation of phenylacetylene with bis(dioxane)di(tert-
butyl)magnesium (2-tBu) in diethyl ether yielded quantitatively
[(Ph-CC)2Mg(dx)2]1 (2’-C2Ph), which is nearly insoluble in 1,4-
dioxane. The NMR spectra reveal that two dioxane molecules
are bound to the magnesium center. The crystal structure of
[(Ph-CC)2Mg(dx)2]1 (2’-C2Ph) verifies that the magnesium
atoms are embedded in octahedral environments forming a
2D network. The structure is depicted in Figure 9. The phenyl-
ethynyl groups are bound above and below the layer formed
by the magnesium atoms and the bridging ether molecules.
Finally, we also investigated the 1,4-dioxane adducts of mag-
nesium chloride and bromide, which precipitated during the
addition of dioxane to solutions of Grignard reagents. Extreme-
ly sparingly soluble [MgBr2(dx)2]1 (2’-Br) was tempered in
warm tetrahydrofuran leading to a single crystalline solid. This
observation is in agreement with the expectation that THF and
dx exhibit comparable basicity leading to very low concentra-
tions of soluble [MgBr2(thf)4], which has been characterized
previously.[26,27] This procedure allowed us to grow single crys-
tals of sufficient quality for X-ray crystal-structure determina-
tion. Homologous [MgCl2(dx)2]1 (2’-Cl) exhibited comparable
crystallization properties.

coordination
polymer
[MgBr2(dx)2]1 (2’-Br) with a layer structure is depicted in
Figure 10; the analogous structure of [MgCl2(dx)2]1 (2’-Cl) is
presented in the Supporting Information. The magnesium cen-
ters in 2’-Br are embedded in octahedral environments with
trans-arranged halide ions. The environments of the magnesi-
um centers are very similar to that in the molecular tetrahydro-
furan adduct [MgBr2(thf)4] with average MgO and MgBr
bond lengths of 216 and 262.5 pm, respectively.[26,27] In the co-
ordination polymer [Mg(m-Br)2(thf)2]1, which has been crystal-
lized from a mixture of dichloromethane and hexane, the bro-
mine atoms occupy bridging positions leading to a coordina-
tion polymer with rather similar MgO and MgBr distances of
212.6 and 263.3 pm, respectively.[27]

pared in Figure 11. The groups R are positioned above and
below the magnesium atoms, leading to penta- and hexacoor-
dinated metal centers, respectively. The steric requirements of
the R groups in 1.5’-C2SiMe3 lead to a honeycomb structure,
whereas the smaller bromine atoms in 2’-Br lead to a tessellat-
ed structure. The directing influence exerted by the steric
demand of the groups R is evident in Figure 11, in which the
same Mg···Mg distances are indicated by the solid lines (sym-
bolizing the bridging dx ligands).
Substitution of dx in [MgBr2(dx)2]1 (2’-Br)
Due to the fact that [MgBr2(dx)2]1 (2’-Br) is nearly insoluble in
common organic solvents, several attempts were undertaken
to recrystallize this coordination polymer. Crystallization of 2’-
Br from a solvent mixture of DMF and dioxane led to the pre-
cipitation of [{(dmf)6Mg}Br2] (A). The molecular structure con-
tains a centrosymmetric cation with a hexacoordinate metal
center and clearly separated bromide ions (Mg···Br 527.7(3) and
678.2(3) pm, see the Supporting Information). Traces of water

also led to the precipitation of a few crystals of the more solu-
ble [{trans-(H2O)2Mg(dmf)4}Br2]1 (B, see the Supporting Infor-
mation). In this latter centrosymmetric molecule, the magnesi-
um atom is in an octahedral environment, coordinated to the
oxygen donors of the dmf ligands (MgO 202.86(10) and
208.26(10) pm) and water (MgO 209.89(11) pm). The bromide
ions are again separated from the cations (Mg···Br 480.8 and
493.8 pm), but are bound at the periphery through hydrogen
bridges to the water ligands (Br···H 248.6 and 252.1 pm). This
mode of coordination leads to the formation of a coordination
polymer with a strand structure. Extraction of [MgBr2(dx)2]1 (2’-
Br) with hot 1,2-dimethoxyethane (dme) only allowed the iso-
lation of the already known [cis-Br2Mg(dme)2] (C).[28] Tridentate
diglyme also forms very stable molecular complexes with
MgBr2,
namely
[(diglyme)Mg(Br)(m-Br)]2
(D)
and
[(digly-
me)(thf)MgBr2] (E) with distorted octahedrally coordinated
metal centers.[29]
Conclusions
In this work we have systematically studied the synthesis of
di(hydrocarbyl)magnesium complexes from ethereal solutions
of Grignard reagents by the addition of 1,4-dioxane. With very
few exceptions, in which the Schlenk equilibrium lies com-
pletely on the side of heteroleptic RMgX complexes (such as
[(Me3Si)2C{MgBr(dx)2}2]),[6] the dioxane method provides advan-
tageous access to soluble R2M compounds. The type of crystal-
line [R2Mg(dx)n] adduct depends on the molar ratio of R2Mg/dx
in solution and on the hydrocarbyl group R, which influences
the solubility and steric requirements. The structure types of
the isolated crystalline derivatives are summarized in Table 1.
High dioxane concentrations and bulkier organic groups
promote the formation of highly soluble mononuclear com-
pounds of structure types 3 (R=Ph) and 2 (R=tBu, oTol, and
Mes[7]). In some cases with substituents of intermediate size
(R=iPr, Bz,[7] and oTol) dinuclear complexes of type 1.5 are ac-
cessible. This structure type can aggregate to form coordina-
tion polymers of type 1’ if the organic groups exhibit a
medium-to-small size and if the concentration of 1,4-dioxane
during crystallization is rather low. For selected medium-sized
derivatives (R=iPr, Ph, and oTol) it was possible to isolate two
different structures in the solid state. R2Mg congeners with ex-
tremely bulky groups (R=C(SiMe3)3 and Mes*)[15] crystallize
without co-ligands from dioxane-containing solutions. A struc-
turally authenticated mono-dioxane adduct of a di(hydrocar-
byl)magnesium complex of type 1 with a three-coordinate
metal center is as yet unknown.
The exchange equilibria with 1,4-dioxane, which depend on
complex concentration, MgR2/dioxane ratio, and the nature of
the group R, are depicted in Scheme 5. Only those derivatives
that exceed the saturation concentration and crystallize are ac-
cessible by this method. Therefore, we cannot exclude a richer
coordination chemistry of di(hydrocarbyl)magnesium–dioxane
adducts with other nuclearities. The complexes R2Mg without
co-ligands can be stabilized with very bulky groups R or isolat-
ed after removal of dioxane in vacuo. The latter procedure
even allowed the isolation of dimethylmagnesium as a coordi-
nation polymer with tetracoordinate magnesium atoms.[16]
The aggregation of mononuclear [R2Mg(dx)2] would lead to
the formation of a coordination polymer with hexacoordinate

thf
adducts
with
the
composition
[R2Mg(thf)4] are known that require very slim ligands to allow
an octahedral environment. The substitution of two thf ligands
by a bridging dioxane molecule enables the formation of coor-
dination polymers with hexacoordinate magnesium centers.
The solubility of the magnesium complexes is strongly relat-
ed to their aggregation chemistry. Molecular complexes of the
types 1.5-R, 2-R, and 3-R are highly soluble in ethereal sol-
vents. The formation of strand structures reduces the solubility
and compounds of type 1’-R are sparingly soluble. Complexes
of the types 1.5’-R and 2’-R form layer structures and are in-
soluble in common organic solvents. The degree of aggrega-
tion is influenced by the size and steric requirements of R, with
small R ligands leading to higher coordination numbers of
magnesium and higher degrees of aggregation.
Experimental Section
General
All manipulations were carried out under anaerobic conditions in
an argon atmosphere using standard Schlenk techniques. The sol-
vents were dried according to common procedures and distilled in
an argon atmosphere; deuterated
solvents were dried over
sodium, degassed, and saturated with argon. The yields given are
not optimized. The magnesium contents of the compounds were
determined by complexometric titrations with Eriochrom Black T.[30]
The alkalinities of the solid diorganylmagnesium compounds were
determined after hydrolysis of a specific amount in ice/water by
acidimetric titration with 0.1n H2SO4 against phenolphthalein. 1H,
13C{1H}, and 29Si{1H} NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AC 400
spectrometer at given temperatures. Chemical shifts are reported
in parts per million (ppm, d scale) relative to the residual signal of
the solvent.[31] Due to fast [D8]THF/dx exchange reactions in solu-
tion, only resonances of noncoordinated dioxane were detected in
the NMR spectra.
Trimethylsilylacetylene (98%) and tert-butyl chloride (95–98%)
were supplied by ABCR GmbH, 1.0m phenylmagnesium bromide
solution in THF by Merck, o-bromotoluene (98%) by Lancaster, iso-
propyl chloride by Fluka, n-butyl chloride by Riedel de Han, n-
propyl bromide by Acros, and 3.0m methylmagnesium chloride so-
lution in THF by Sigma–Aldrich.
Synthesis and characterization
Synthesis of [(CH3)2Mg(m-dx)]1 (1’-Me): A solution of commercial
3.0m methylmagnesium chloride in THF (17 mL, 51 mmol) was di-
luted with THF (50 mL). The slow addition of 1,4-dioxane (18 mL,
204 mmol) led to the precipitation of [MgCl2(dx)2]. The reaction
mixture was stored overnight at room temperature and then fil-
tered through a frit covered with diatomaceous earth. A yield of
87% was determined by titration of an aliquot of the filtrate with
0.1n HCl. All volatiles were removed in vacuo and the residue
evacuated until dryness. The residue was dissolved in dioxane
(30 mL) and this suspension was heated at reflux for 10 min. Then,
the hot solution was filtered through a Schlenk frit covered with
diatomaceous earth. During cooling of the filtrate colorless crystals
precipitated. These crystals were collected on a frit, washed with
diethyl ether, and dried in vacuo. Yield: 1.3 g of 1’-Me (35.8% rela-
tive to CH3MgCl). During hydrolysis of this compound with ice/
water, inflammation occurred. Therefore, a specific amount of this
compound was dissolved in THF and this solution was carefully hy-
drolyzed to quantitatively determine the metal content. Alkalinity:

magnesium bromide was prepared from magnesium turnings
(3.0 g, 123.4 mmol) and n-propyl bromide (12.4 g, 100.8 mmol) in
diethyl ether (100 mL; yield: 82%). 1,4-Dioxane (16 mL, 182 mmol)
was then added dropwise to this reaction mixture. During this
highly exothermic procedure a colorless precipitate formed. After
resting overnight the precipitate was removed by means of a
Schlenk frit covered with diatomaceous earth. An aliquot of the fil-
trate was titrated with 0.1m HCl (yield: 64%). The volume of the
solution was reduced to a fifth of the original volume and stored
in a refrigerator at 408C. The colorless crystals of 1’-nPr precipi-
tated from this mother liquor were washed with very cold diethyl

0.211 mol; yield: 82%). 1,4-Dioxane (22 mL, 0.25 mol) was then
added dropwise to this solution. During this highly exothermic
procedure a colorless solid precipitated. After standing overnight
the precipitate was removed by means of a Schlenk frit covered
with diatomaceous earth. An aliquot of the filtrate was titrated
with 0.1m HCl (yield: 59%). All volatiles were removed and the res-
idue dried in vacuo. Then diethyl ether (10 mL) was added and this
solution was stored at 788C. A colorless amorphous precipitate
formed that was collected and dried in vacuo. Yield: 2.4 g of 1-nBu

ings (6.0 g, 0.247 mol) and isopropyl chloride (24.0 g, 0.195 mol) in
diethyl ether (100 mL; yield: 55%). 1,4-Dioxane (28 mL, 0.318 mol)
was then slowly added at room temperature. During this proce-

1,4-Dioxane
(30 mL,

ride solution (100 mL) in diethyl ether. During this procedure a col-

room temperature Then, the precipitate was removed by means of
a Schlenk frit covered with diatomaceous earth and washed with
diethyl ether. Acidimetric titration of an aliquot gave a yield of
33%. The filtrate was concentrated till crystallization started and
then stored in a refrigerator. This suspension was mixed with hep-
tane (20 mL) and the precipitate collected on a frit and washed
with heptane. The solid was briefly dried in vacuo because it lost li-
gated dioxane when exposed to a vacuum. Yield: 9.0 g of colorless,

Synthesis of [(oTol)2Mg(h1-dx)2] (2-oTol): Magnesium turnings
(3.0 g, 123 mmol) were suspended in diethyl ether (100 mL). There-
after, o-tolyl bromide (17.09 g, 99 mmol) was slowly added to the
mixture in portions of 2 mL. The reaction was initiated by the addi-
tion of some drops of 1,2-dibromoethane. After the reaction
seemed to cease, the mixture was heated at reflux for 1 h. Then,
the solution was filtered through a Schlenk frit (filled with anhy-
drous diatomaceous earth; yield: 67%, as calculated from titration
of an aliquot with 0.1n H2SO4). The filtrate was cooled to room
temperature and then dioxane (13 mL, 122 mmol) was slowly
added in 2 mL portions. The reaction mixture was kept overnight
at room temperature and precipitated [MgBr2(dx)2] was removed
by filtration through a Schlenk frit (titrated yield: 17.4%). Pure 2-
oTol crystallized from the filtrate at 58C. Yield: 2.91 g of colorless
crystals of 2-o-Tol (15.2% with respect to the initially used o-tolyl
bromide); alkalinity: calcd: 256.2 mg H2SO4g1; found: 250.8 mg;

Synthesis of [Ph2Mg(h1-dx)3] (3-Ph): A commercially available
1.0m PhMgBr solution in THF (50 mL, 50 mmol) and dioxane
(50 mL) were combined and the mixture heated at reflux. During
this procedure a colorless solid precipitated, which was removed
by means of a Schlenk frit. All volatiles of the filtrate were removed
in vacuo. The dry residue was dissolved in boiling dioxane (50 mL)
and filtered through a Schlenk frit covered with diatomaceous
earth. Then, toluene (5 mL) was added to the filtrate and the
volume reduced until crystallization started. At room temperature
the majority of the colorless compound crystallized. These crystals
were collected on a Schlenk frit, washed with cold diethyl ether,
and briefly dried in vacuo. Yield: 2.1 g of 3-Ph (19% relative to ini-
tially used phenylmagnesium bromide solution); alkalinity: calcd:

Synthesis of [(Me3Si-CC)2Mg(m-dx)1.5]1 (1.5’-C2SiMe3): Trimethyl-
silylacetylene (4.3 g, 43.78 mmol) and dioxane (4.0 mL, 45.45 mmol)
were added at room temperature to a 0.87m solution of 1’-nPr in
diethyl ether (50 mL, 43.5 mmol). Shortly thereafter, a microcrystal-
line solid of 1.5’-C2SiMe3 formed. This precipitate was collected on
a Schlenk frit, thoroughly washed with diethyl ether, and dried in
vacuum. Yield: 5.30 g of 1.5’-C2SiMe3 (69% relative to the initially
used
trimethylsilylacetylene);

Single crystals of 1.5’-C2SiMe3 were obtained when trimethylsilyl-
acetylene (1.2 g, 12.2 mmol) and dioxane (1.0 mL, 11.4 mmol) were
added to a 0.36m solution of [(n-C4H9)2Mg(dx)] (12.6 mmol) in di-
ethyl ether (35 mL) at 208C and stored overnight in a refrigerator
at 58C.
Synthesis of [(Ph-CC)2Mg(dx)2]1 (2’-C2Ph): A freshly prepared
0.365m solution of [(nBu)2Mg(dx)] in diethyl ether (90 mL; see
above) was cooled to 08C. Phenylacetylene (6.4 g, 62.7 mmol) was
added dropwise to this solution with stirring. Evolution of a color-
less gas was observed as the drops of phenylacetylene hit the solu-
tion. After the addition of half of the Ph-CC-H a colorless precipi-
tate formed. After complete addition of phenylacetylene the reac-
tion mixture was stirred at room temperature for an additional
hour. The precipitate was collected on a Schlenk frit, washed with
diethyl ether, and dried in vacuo. Yield: 12.13 g (96% relative to
the initially used phenylacetylene) of 2’-C2Ph; alkalinity: calcd:

Schlenk tube to yield a white amorphous precipitate after a few
minutes. After 1 week at this temperature, the precipitate trans-
formed into colorless crystals of 2’-Cl of different size.
Crystallization of [MgBr2(m-dx)2]1 (2’-Br): A 0.9m solution of n-
propylmagnesium bromide (3.0 mL, 2.7 mmol) in THF was diluted
with THF (25 mL). Then, 1,4-dioxane (0.9 mL, 10.2 mmol) was
added. The clear solution was heated at 658C. During this proce-
dure a colorless precipitate of 2’-Br slowly formed. This suspension
was tempered for 1 week at this temperature. During this time, the
precipitate aged and turned into a crystalline solid with crystals of
different size.
Crystal structure determinations: The intensity data for the com-
pounds were collected on a Nonius KappaCCD diffractometer
using graphite-monochromated MoKa irradiation. The data were
corrected for Lorentzian and polarization effects; absorption was
taken into account on a semi-empirical basis using multiple
scans.[32–34]
The
structures
were
solved
by
direct
methods
(SHELXS)[35] and refined by full-matrix least-squares techniques
against Fo
2 (SHELXL-97).[36] The hydrogen atoms of the compounds
1’-Me, 1’-nPr, 2-tBu, and B were located by difference Fourier syn-
thesis and refined isotropically. All other hydrogen atoms were in-
cluded at calculated positions with fixed thermal parameters. The
crystal of 2’-C2Ph was a non-merohedral twin. The twin law was
determined by PLATON[37] as (0.003 0.997 0.000) (1.003 0.003
0.000) (0.000 0.000 1.000). The contribution of the main compo-
nent was refined to 0.845(1). All non-disordered, non-hydrogen
atoms were refined anisotropically.[36] The crystals of 1.5’-C2SiMe3
were extremely thin and/or of low quality, resulting in a substan-
dard data set; however, the structure is of sufficient quality to
show connectivity and geometry despite the high final R value. We
only publish here the conformation of the molecule and the crys-
tallographic data. We will not deposit the data at the Cambridge
Crystallographic Data Centre. The crystallographic data as well as
structure solution and refinement details are summarized in
Table S1 in the Supporting Information). XP[38] and POV-Ray[39] soft-
ware were used for structure representations.
