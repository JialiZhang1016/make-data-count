Assessment of Riparian Vegetation Patterns and Change 
Downstream from Glen Canyon Dam from 2014 to 2019
By Emily C. Palmquist,1 Bradley J. Butterfield,2 and Barbara E. Ralston1
Abstract
Changes in riparian vegetation cover and composition 
occur in relation to flow regime, geomorphic template, 
and climate, and can have cascading effects on aquatic and 
terrestrial ecosystems. Tracking such changes over time 
is therefore an important part of monitoring the condition 
and trajectory of riparian ecosystems. Maintaining diverse, 
self-sustaining riparian vegetation comprised of mostly native 
species is identified in the Glen Canyon Dam Long-Term 
Experimental and Management Plan as a key resource 
objective for the section of the Colorado River between Glen 
Canyon Dam and Lake Mead. The U.S. Geological Survey 
Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center implemented 
an annual monitoring program in 2014 to assess the status 
and trends of riparian vegetation along this section of river, 
particularly as they relate to flow regime. In this report, 
we summarize plant species composition and cover data 
collected under the annual monitoring program from 2014 
to 2019, with special consideration given to the hydrologic 
position, associated geomorphic feature class, local climate 
patterns, native and nonnative species, and floristic region 
for key vegetation metrics and species. We divided the study 
area into four river segments (referred to as Glen Canyon, 
Marble Canyon, eastern Grand Canyon, and western Grand 
Canyon) on the basis of geography and floristic composition 
and calculated each recorded plant species’ relative frequency 
and foliar cover by river segment. These data were then 
used to evaluate species composition relationships among 
river segments, hydrologic zones, geomorphic features, and 
sampling years through ordination analysis. Temporal trends 
in our focal resource objectives—species richness, total foliar 
cover, proportion of native to nonnative species richness, 
proportion of native to nonnative species cover, Tamarix cover, 
Pluchea sericea cover, and Baccharis species cover—were 
assessed using mixed-effects models. Four patterns related 
to species composition emerged: (1) species composition of 
fixed-site sandbars differed from that of randomly selected 
sites (including randomly selected sandbars), (2) species 
composition of Glen Canyon sites differed from that of other

previously identified floristic regions, (3) species composition 
differed across hydrologic zones related to dam operations, 
and (4) species composition within river segments did 
not change across years. For temporal patterns, four main 
findings emerged: (1) trends differed between fixed-sites and 
randomly selected sites; (2) although few directional changes 
were observed from 2014 to 2019, Baccharis species cover 
increased at randomly selected sites in areas influenced by 
daily water fluctuations; (3) native species cover and richness 
were greater than nonnative species cover and richness across 
all hydrologic zones; and (4) the temporal trend metrics used 
here can be used across floristic groups, enabling assessment 
of the Colorado River ecosystem as a whole. In addition to 
these findings, lists of recorded plant species are included as 
appendixes. The variations and patterns in vegetation status 
and trends presented in this report can be used as a baseline 
against which future monitoring can be compared.
Introduction
Riparian ecosystems are dynamic, disturbance-driven 
habitats (Poff and others, 1997), and temporal changes to 
riparian vegetation are integral to riparian functioning (Naiman 
and Decamps, 1997; Tabacchi and others, 1998). Disturbance 
events, particularly floods, periodically reshape riparian areas 
by eroding and depositing sediment, distributing seeds and 
propagules, redistributing nutrients, and damaging or removing 
vegetation (Stevens and Waring, 1986; Gregory and others, 
1991; Tabacchi and others, 1998; Dong and others, 2016). 
Between large disturbance events, succession occurs, leading to 
changes in vegetation structure, composition, and aerial extent 
(Webb and Leake, 2006; Stromberg and others, 2010; Sarr and 
others, 2011; Sankey and others, 2015). Changes in riparian 
vegetation composition and cover over time are therefore 
expected consequences of natural ecosystem processes.
Flow regime is a primary controlling factor for riparian 
vegetation composition and change (Poff and others, 1997; 
Stromberg and others, 2007). The timing, magnitude, duration, 
and frequency of flooding establishes the rate of succession 
and development of riparian vegetation (Tabacchi and others, 
1998). Natural flow regimes can be highly dynamic within 
a year but are fairly predictable across years, such that high 
and low flows exhibit a consistent seasonality (Poff and 
others, 1997; Topping and others, 2003). High volume or long 
2    Riparian Vegetation Patterns and Change Downstream from Glen Canyon Dam, 2014–2019
duration floods can remove vegetation, clearing the riparian 
area for new colonization (Stevens and Waring, 1985; Dean 
and Schmidt, 2011). Many Populus (cottonwood) and Salix 
(willow) species require vegetation-clearing floods during 
species-specific times of the year in order to germinate 
(González and others, 2018); without such floods, their 
populations decline (Rood and others, 2005; Merritt and 
Poff, 2010; Mortenson and Weisberg, 2010). Reduced flood 
peaks—whether due to climate shifts or river regulation—
can create an opportunity for riparian vegetation to expand 
and stabilize the floodplain (Sankey and others, 2015; Scott 
and others, 2018). Increasing year-round baseflows (in 
other words, creating a constant water supply) in concert 
with flood-peak reduction provides the context for woody 
riparian species to proliferate (Stromberg and others, 2007; 
Mortenson and Weisberg, 2010; Sankey and others, 2015) 
and can promote clonal growth (Douhovnikoff and others, 
2005; Ralston, 2011)—an example of how alterations to flow 
regime can change the composition, cover, and diversity of 
riparian vegetation. The parameters of the new flow regime 
and the available species pool determine the resulting riparian 
vegetation community.
The influence of flow regime on trends in riparian 
vegetation change is constrained by a hierarchy of 
environmental variables. At a broad scale, riparian vegetation 
communities shift along longitudinal gradients related to 
climate (McShane and others, 2015; Palmquist and others, 
2018a). As changes in climate occur over time (manifested as 
temperature, precipitation, and subsequent flow dynamics), 
riparian species composition is also likely to change (Perry 
and others, 2015; Reynolds and others, 2015). Within 
landscape-scale patterns of climate, channel form, geology, 
geomorphology, and alternating constrained and floodplain 
river reaches affect species occurrence (Tabacchi and others, 
1998; McShane and others, 2015). Flow interactions with 
geomorphology maintain a mosaic of vegetation patches with 
differing species compositions based on differences in soil 
water holding capacity and topography (Lytle and Poff, 2004; 
Lite and others, 2005; Stromberg and others, 2007). Channel 
form controls the velocity and depth of flows, such that narrow 
reaches have different flood dynamics than wide reaches. At 
a local scale, species turnover occurs along lateral gradients 
related to water and oxygen availability (Bendix, 1994b; Lite 
and others, 2005), with more flood tolerant species growing 
closer to base flows (McCoy-Sulentic and others, 2017a).
River regulation via large dams affects riparian vegetation 
composition and cover through many of the same mechanisms 
listed above. Large dams dramatically change flow regime 
and reduce sediment inputs (Webb and others, 1999; Gloss 
and others, 2005; Magilligan and Nislow, 2005). They can 
alter the geomorphic template of a river by changing the 
grain size distribution of sediment deposits, eroding potential 
habitat for vegetation, and changing feedback loops between 
vegetation and sediment (Rubin and others, 2002; Hazel and 
others, 2006; Butterfield and others, 2020). Depending on 
pre- and post-dam flow characteristics, riparian vegetation 
can increase or decrease in cover and richness, shift in species 
composition, maintain or lose functional groups, and change 
in genetic structure (Jansson and others, 2000; Douhovnikoff 
and others, 2005; Beauchamp and Stromberg, 2008; Merritt 
and Poff, 2010; Bejarano and others, 2012; Werth and others, 
2014; Sankey and others, 2015; Bejarano and others, 2018). 
Vegetation changes related to dam operations can occur on 
different time and spatial scales depending on the natural 
processes affected and species longevity. Long after dam 
operations are implemented, riparian vegetation composition 
and cover can continue to shift as a result of ecosystem change, 
flow regime management, invasive plant species management, 
and the occurrence of other disturbances such as fire, 
restoration efforts, and insect herbivory (Stevens and others, 
1995; Kearsley and Ayers, 1996; Sankey and others, 2015).
Tracking riparian vegetation change is a primary 
method for assessing riparian ecosystem condition because 
riparian vegetation exists at the intersection between aquatic 
and terrestrial systems and provides habitat and other key 
resources for both (Merritt and others, 2017; Palmquist 
and others, 2018b; Perkins and others, 2018). Consistent 
monitoring of vegetation and periodic assessment of the data 
collected to identify changes to riparian species diversity, 
distributions, and cover provide information about the 
trajectory of riparian vegetation change relative to hydrology 
and other abiotic or management manipulations (for example, 
invasive plant management). In this report, we examine plant 
species composition and trends in plant cover from 2014 
to 2019 along the segment of the Colorado River between 
Glen Canyon Dam and Lake Mead. These patterns are 
analyzed in the context of hydrologic, geomorphological, and 
climate parameters and discussed relative to other sources 
of vegetation change (for example, vegetation management 
actions and biological control of invasive species).
The segment of the Colorado River between Glen 
Canyon Dam and Lake Mead supports a culturally and 
ecologically important riparian ecosystem that fulfills a 
variety of societal and ecological functions. Located in 
northwestern Arizona, this section of the Colorado River 
(hereafter referred to as the “study area” or “study reach”) 
flows through the lower part of Glen Canyon, Marble Canyon, 
and Grand Canyon within Glen Canyon National Recreation 
Area (GLCA) and Grand Canyon National Park (GRCA). 
The study area supports a suite of animal life including birds, 
mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and invertebrates (Carothers 
and others, 1976; Schmidt and others, 1998; Stevens and 
others, 2001; Holmes and others, 2005). Riparian vegetation 
in Grand Canyon is traditionally important to many regional 
tribes, in part for its role in supporting the overall health of 
Grand Canyon ecosystems and for the usefulness of particular 
species (Mayes and Lacy, 1989; Fairley, 2005; Jackson-Kelly 
and Hubbs, 2007). Some plant species are important to river 
recreationists for the shade and protection from wind they 
provide in a hot, dry climate (Stewart and others, 2003). 
In the southwestern United States, where riparian areas are 
often impaired and degraded (Stromberg and others, 2012; 
Stromberg and others, 2013), this riparian area supports some 
functions lost in other dryland areas (Spence, 2006).
Methods    3
Riparian vegetation expansion in the study area has 
a positive effect on bird communities. The diversity and 
abundance of bird species increased with the establishment 
of perennial riparian vegetation near the river’s edge (Brown 
and Johnson, 1985) and are predicted to increase further as 
habitat patches grow larger and become more contiguous 
(Holmes and others, 2005). The volume and location of woody 
plant species are identified as key qualities for predicting the 
abundance of breeding birds (Sogge and others, 1998; Spence, 
2006). Plant species composition is also important to breeding 
birds; for example, Prosopis glandulosa (honey mesquite) 
and Senegalia greggii (catclaw acacia) densities promote bird 
density (Kearsley and others, 2004). Changes to the extent, 
amount, and species composition of riparian vegetation in the 
study area will affect bird diversity and abundance (Holmes 
and others, 2005).
In the study area, increases in shrubby riparian 
plant cover are considered detrimental to campsites and 
archeological sites, which are identified as key resources in the 
Glen Canyon Dam Long-Term Experimental and Management 
Plan (U.S. Department of the Interior, 2016; Durning and 
others, 2021). Increased shrub cover on historically large, 
bare sandbars is the primary cause of a 37-percent reduction 
from 2002 to 2016 in the limited camping area available 
for the more than 25,000 boaters and hikers that recreate in 
the area annually (National Park Service, 2006; Hadley and 
others, 2018). The study area provides a unique wilderness 
experience for recreationists that is supported in part by access 
to a sufficient number of suitable campsites and day use areas 
(Kearsley and others, 1994; Kaplinski and others, 2005). 
Vegetation expansion on large sandbars in the study area 
also reduces aeolian transport of sand, which has historically 
facilitated the burial and protection of archeological sites 
(East and others, 2017; Hadley and others, 2018; Kasprak 
and others, 2018); thus, vegetation expansion decreases 
the stability of the unique cultural legacy found along the 
Colorado River (Sankey and Draut, 2014). Vegetation 
expansion near the river edge is predicted to continue (Sankey 
and others, 2015; Kasprak and others, 2018), potentially 
exacerbating the negative effects of riparian vegetation 
expansion on these Colorado River resources.
As identified in the record of decision for the Glen 
Canyon Dam Long-Term Experimental and Management Plan 
final environmental impact statement (U.S. Department of the 
Interior, 2016), the goal for riparian vegetation in the study 
area is to “maintain native vegetation and wildlife habitat, in 
various stages of maturity, such that they are diverse, healthy, 
productive, self-sustaining, and ecologically appropriate.” 
The long-term monitoring data presented herein can be used 
to address questions related to the diversity, productivity, 
and relative dominance of native and nonnative species in 
terms of areal cover and species composition. Assessing the 
quality of wildlife habitat would require additional sampling 
of vegetation structure, and assessing the maturity, health, 
and sustainability of vegetation would require plant growth 
and demography monitoring that is beyond the scope of this 
program. However, the long-term monitoring data herein can 
provide indirect insights into such objectives. The objective of 
ecological appropriateness can be judged by stakeholders on 
the basis of the results presented in this report.
To reliably and consistently track changes to riparian 
vegetation within the study area, a long-term monitoring 
protocol was developed and implemented by the Grand 
Canyon Monitoring and Research Center (GCMRC; Palmquist 
and others, 2018b; Palmquist and others, 2019). Given the 
influence of geomorphology, climate, and flow regime in 
determining riparian vegetation composition and cover, 
the protocol incorporates geomorphic feature classes, flow 
parameters, and river segments related to floristic groups and 
climate into vegetation sampling. The primary objectives of 
the GCMRC riparian monitoring program are as follows:
•	 Annually measure and summarize the status (that 
is, composition and cover) of native and nonnative 
vascular plant species within the riparian zone of 
the Colorado River between Glen Canyon Dam and 
Lake Mead.
•	 At 5-year intervals, assess change in the vegetation 
composition and cover within the riparian zone, as 
related to geomorphic setting and dam operations 
(particularly flow regime).
•	 Collect data in such a manner that it can be used by 
multiple stakeholders and is compatible with the 
basin-wide monitoring program overseen by the 
National Park Service’s Northern Colorado Plateau 
Network Inventory and Monitoring program (Perkins 
and others, 2018).
This status and trends report summarizes species 
composition and cover data collected from 2014 to 2019, with 
special consideration given to floristic region, hydrologic 
position, associated geomorphic feature, and native and 
nonnative species.

Physical Setting
The section of the Colorado River between Glen 
Canyon Dam and the high-water inflow of Lake Mead is an 
approximately 415-kilometer (km; 260-mile [mi]) reach that 
passes through Glen Canyon National Recreation Area and 
Grand Canyon National Park (fig. 1). Locations along the river 
are denoted using river kilometers (Rkm; Gushue, 2019)—
that is, by their distance downstream (positive numbers) or 
upstream (negative numbers) from Lees Ferry as measured in 
kilometers along the channel centerline. For the purposes of 
the GCMRC riparian monitoring program, the river corridor 
is divided into four segments that relate to geography and 
floristic composition (Palmquist and others, 2018a): the Glen 
Canyon river segment, spanning from Rkm −25 to Rkm 0 
(hereafter referred to as “Glen Canyon”); the Marble Canyon

Figure 1.  Map of the Colorado River between Glen Canyon Dam and the high-water inflow of Lake Mead, with eight tributaries identified. The river 
corridor is divided into four segments (shown in different shades of gray) that relate to geography and floristic patterns: the Glen Canyon segment, 
spanning from Glen Canyon Dam to Lees Ferry (river kilometers [Rkm] −25–0); the Marble Canyon segment, spanning from Lees Ferry to the Little 
Colorado River (Rkm 0–97); the eastern Grand Canyon segment, spanning from the Little Colorado River to National Canyon (Rkm 97–259); and the 
western Grand Canyon segment, spanning from National Canyon to the high-water inflow of Lake Mead (Rkm 259–404). Fixed-site sandbar locations 
are indicated by blue hexagons.

segment, spanning from Rkm 0 to Rkm 97 (hereafter “Marble 
Canyon”); the eastern Grand Canyon segment, spanning from 
Rkm 97 to Rkm 259 (hereafter “eastern Grand Canyon”); and 
the western Grand Canyon segment, spanning from Rkm 259 
to Rkm 404 (hereafter “western Grand Canyon”; fig. 1). At 
Rkm 404, the high-water line of Lake Mead is apparent on 
the shorelines of the Colorado River as deltaic sediments that 
were deposited when the reservoir was full; these deposits are 
not included in the GCMRC riparian monitoring protocol.
The geologic rock layers at river level include limestones, 
sandstones, and Precambrian metamorphic rocks, with each 
layer affecting the channel width and associated habitable 
area for plants. Throughout the study area, the Colorado 
River is a canyon-bound river with a pool-drop rapid system 
in which rapids are associated with tributary debris fans 
(Schmidt and Graf, 1990). Approximately 740 tributaries 
(most of them ephemeral) join the Colorado River’s mainstem 
between Glen Canyon Dam and Lake Mead (Griffiths and 
others, 2004). Debris fans originating from these tributaries 
form channel constrictions that create rapids and affect the 
direction and velocity of the river current and associated 
sediment deposition (Rubin and others, 1990). Upstream 
from a channel constriction, water pools and the current is 
slower, and sediment can accumulate along the upstream 
shoreline. Downstream from a constriction, part of the current 
recirculates upstream and slows, creating an eddy wherein 
sediment deposition can also occur. Shorelines both upstream 
and downstream from channel constrictions are areas where 
sediment accumulates and forms sandbars (fig. 2; Schmidt and 
Graf, 1990; Mueller and others, 2018). Within this geomorphic

Figure 2.  Aerial photograph 
showing examples of the generalized 
feature classes (debris fan, sandbar, 
and channel margin) that form 
the geomorphic template of the 
Colorado River within the study 
area. Debris fans are cone-shaped, 
coarse-grained sediment deposits 
emanating from tributaries, and 
sandbars are fine-grained deposits 
that form upstream and downstream 
from debris fans; the channel margin 
feature class encompasses all other 
shorelines. Hydrologic zones related 
to Glen Canyon Dam operations 
(active channel, active floodplain, 
and inactive floodplain) are also 
depicted. The active channel is 
the area inundated by daily flow 
fluctuations (discharges of 707 cubic 
meters per second [m3/s] or less); the 
active floodplain is the area flooded 
by high flow experiments (discharges 
between 707 and 1,274 m3/s); and 
the inactive floodplain, which is 
rarely flooded under current dam 
operations, is the area inundated by 
discharges of more than 1,274 m3/s.

of flow. Base image from Durning and

template, there are three generalized feature classes on which 
riparian vegetation can grow: debris fans, sandbars, and 
channel margins. Debris fans are triangular or cone-shaped 
deposits of boulders, cobbles, gravel, and sand that typically 
emanate from tributaries; and sandbars are fine-grained 
deposits located upstream and downstream from debris 
fans. Channel margins encompass all other shorelines and 
can consist of bedrock and (or) deposited boulders, cobbles, 
gravel, and sand (fig. 2).
Hydrology
The hydrology of the study reach is controlled by Glen 
Canyon Dam (fig. 1). Before dam operations began in 1963, 
the Colorado River had a seasonal snowmelt-dominated 
hydrograph with large seasonal flow volume variation and 
little daily variation; in the post-dam era, however, discharge 
fluctuates daily but is relatively similar across seasons 
(figs. 3, 4). Except for large, unplanned floods in the 1980s, 
post-dam floods peak at less than half the magnitude of 
pre-dam floods, are relatively infrequent, and occur primarily 
in the fall rather than late spring and summer (as was 
typical before the dam; Topping and others, 2003). Within 
the post-dam era, the magnitude of daily fluctuations from 
1963 to the mid-1990s was greater (sometimes exceeding 
790 m3/s) than it is under current conditions (in which it 
does not exceed 226 m3/s) owing to the implementation of 
the Modified Low Fluctuating Flow operation pattern (U.S. 
Department of the Interior, 2016). The potential for releases 
exceeding 707 m3/s over several days has increased relative 
to that from 1963 to 2011 owing to implementation of the 
Experimental Management Plan for Glen Canyon Dam. 
This plan incorporates short-duration (that is, dayslong) 
high-flow experiment (HFE) releases in spring or fall if 
resource criteria for water, sediment, and fish are met (U.S. 
Department of the Interior, 2016). The pre-dam high-water 
line, the experimental high flows, and the daily fluctuating 
flows create a gradient of inundation frequency ranging 
from a more frequently flooded area close to the river to an 
infrequently flooded area far away from the shoreline (fig. 2). 
Three hydrologic zones are delineated based on these effects 
of dam operations (fig. 4). The active channel is the area that 
can be inundated by daily fluctuating flows (that is, by flows 
of 708 m3/s or less) and is the most frequently flooded zone. 
The active floodplain is the area inundated by HFE releases 
(that is, by discharges between 708 and 1,274 m3/s) and is 
less frequently flooded than the active channel. The inactive 
floodplain is the area within the historical high-water line that 
is no longer inundated by planned dam releases. The inactive 
floodplain zone was last flooded in the 1980s and is currently 
more influenced by local precipitation than river flows 
(Sankey and others, 2015).

delineate three hydrologic zones (active channel, active floodplain, and inactive floodplain) on the basis of 
inundation frequency. Red arrows indicate the range of discharge levels associated with each hydrologic zone. 
Active channel is defined as the area inundated by daily fluctuating flows that range up to 708 cubic meters 
per second [m3/s]. Active floodplain is defined as the area inundated by HFE releases (that is, by discharges 
between 708 and 1,274 m3/s). Inactive floodplain is defined as the area within the historical high-water line that 
is no longer inundated by planned dam releases. Light blue dashed line represents the minimum daytime flow 
(227 m3/s) from Glen Canyon Dam under the Long-Term Experimental and Management Plan record of decision 
(U.S. Department of the Interior, 2016).
Riparian Vegetation History and Floristic 
Distributions
Vegetation growing along the study reach varies greatly 
in structure, functional strategies, wetland indicator status, 
and floristic affinities (McCoy-Sulentic and others, 2017a; 
McCoy-Sulentic and others, 2017b; Palmquist and others, 
2017; Palmquist and others, 2018a). Species range from 
less than 1 centimeter tall to over 8 meters (m) tall and 
include annual, biennial, and perennial forbs, sedges, rushes, 
grasses, shrubs, and trees (Palmquist and others, 2017). 
Vegetation is densely layered in some parts of the canyon, 
consisting of a short-statured herbaceous layer (for example, 
Schedonorus arundinaceus, Cynodon dactylon, Equisetum 
x ferrissii, Euthamia occidentalis, Bromus diandrus), a 
midstory to overstory layer of woody shrubs (for example, 
Baccharis emoryi, Baccharis salicifolia, Pluchea sericea), 
and sometimes an overstory of trees (Prosopis glandulosa, 
Tamarix). Individuals of Tamarix (saltcedar) in this study 
area (hereafter “Tamarix”) conform to the morphology of T. 
ramosissima and T. chinensis and are likely hybrids of the two 
species given their widespread introgression in the western 
United States (Gaskin and Schaal, 2002). In other areas, such 
as less vegetated sandbars or newer debris fans, vegetation 
is sparse and short, comprised mostly of smaller shrubs 
and grasses.
Plant species in the study area are associated primarily 
with desert and semiarid regions of the western United States, 
particularly the Mojave and Sonoran deserts but also the 
Colorado Plateau, Great Basin, and the Rocky Mountains 
(Palmquist and others, 2018a). Floristic patterns along the 
river follow an increasing temperature gradient with distance 
from Glen Canyon Dam, and three distinct floristic regions 
can be delineated that correspond with different river segments 
(Butterfield and others, 2018; Palmquist and others, 2018a). 
Of these floristic regions, Marble Canyon (Rkm 0–97) 
contains the highest proportion of species with affinities to 
higher elevation regions, particularly the Colorado Plateau 
and Rocky Mountains. Eastern Grand Canyon (Rkm 97–259) 
features an intermediate floristic group comprising a mixture 
of plants from Marble Canyon and western Grand Canyon. 
Western Grand Canyon (Rkm 259–404) is dominated by 
species with affinities to the Mojave and Sonoran deserts. 
Glen Canyon (Rkm −25–0) was not included in Palmquist 
8    Riparian Vegetation Patterns and Change Downstream from Glen Canyon Dam, 2014–2019
and others (2018a), but we address it in the present study 
to determine if the unique species found there differentiate 
Glen Canyon floristically from Marble Canyon. Species 
composition also shifts laterally away from the river’s edge 
with decreasing flood tolerance and increasing drought 
tolerance (McCoy-Sulentic and others, 2017a; Butterfield and 
others, 2018). These shifts in species composition result in a 
corresponding shift in functional trait values (McCoy-Sulentic 
and others, 2017a).
Prior to dam operations, the shoreline of the Colorado 
River through Marble and Grand Canyons was characterized 
much more by rock and sand than by riparian vegetation 
(Webb, 1996; Webb and others, 2011; Scott and others, 
2018). The species recorded in the pre-dam era by Clover and 
Jotter (1944) are many of the dominant species recorded in 
current surveys, including nonnative species such as Cynodon 
dactylon (Bermuda grass) and Tamarix. Native riparian 
trees such as Populus fremontii (Fremont cottonwood) and 
Salix gooddingii (Goodding’s willow) were largely absent 
in the pre-dam era except at the mouths of tributaries and 
more protected areas (Clover and Jotter, 1944; Turner and 
Karpiscak, 1980; Scott and others, 2018), though S. gooddingii 
appears to have been more common than P. fremontii (Clover 
and Jotter, 1944; Turner and Karpiscak, 1980). Naturally 
occurring P. fremontii and S. gooddingii stands are still 
uncommon in the study area.
Regulated flows from Glen Canyon Dam have allowed 
the areal cover of riparian vegetation to increase since dam 
operations began in 1963 (Sankey and others, 2015; Mueller 
and others, 2018), though growth rates vary in space and time. 
Variable flow patterns, including large floods in the 1980s 
and increased base flows, have alternately removed some 
vegetation (Stevens and Waring, 1986), supported fluvial 
marshes (Stevens and others, 1995), supported woody plant 
expansion into fluvial marshes (Kearsley and Ayers, 1996), 
promoted germination of and then eroded nonnative Tamarix 
seedlings (Porter and Kearsley, 2001), and created conditions 
favorable to clonal species (Ralston, 2010; Durning and 
others, 2021). Particularly since the beginning of Modified 
Low Fluctuating Flow in the early 1990s, vegetated area has 
increased in the active channel and active floodplain from 
approximately 5–9 percent to 25–40 percent depending on 
hydrological position (Sankey and others, 2015). Vegetation 
expansion is projected to continue under current dam 
operations and could increase 12 percent over the next 
15 years (Kasprak and others, 2018).
Climate Variability
The climate of the study area is warm and dry with 
most precipitation falling in the winter and late summer 
(fig. 5; Caster and Sankey, 2016). Late summer precipitation

is associated with the North American monsoon and 
characterized by intense, localized thunderstorms between 
July and October. March through June and October through 
December are typically dry periods.
Climate data were acquired for the study period from 
three weather stations along the Colorado River: PGEA3, 
located at Lees Ferry (Rkm 0); USC00026471, located at 
Phantom Ranch (Rkm 143); and AZ G:03:0072, located 
near the confluence of Diamond Creek and the Colorado 
River (Rkm 359). Data for PGEA3 were downloaded from 
MesoWest (https:​//mesowest​.utah.edu/​) and for USC00026471 
from the National Climate Data Center (https:​//www.ncdc​
.noaa.gov/​cdo-​web/​). Data from AZ G:03:0072 were sourced 
from Caster and others (2018). Temperatures associated with 
the weather station at Lees Ferry were coolest, with a mean 
average temperature of 18.2 °C during the study period. 
Phantom Ranch temperatures were warmer at 20.4 °C, and 
Diamond Creek temperatures were warmest at 24.3 °C. The 
weather station at Lees Ferry received less average annual 
precipitation (164 millimeters [mm]) than the Phantom Ranch 
(250 mm) and Diamond Creek (337 mm) stations. In general, 
2015 and 2016 were the wettest years. The driest years were 
2014 and 2017, and 2019 had an exceptionally dry summer 
season (fig. 5).
Data Collection and Preparation
Data collection follows the methods described in detail 
in Palmquist and others (2018b) with a few exceptions. Data 
are collected at two different types of sites once per year: 
randomly selected sites that encompass multiple geomorphic 
features and are in different locations each year; and fixed-site 
eddy sandbars that are resampled each year. Pilot studies 
were conducted in 2012 and 2013 at a subset of locations for 
both fixed-site and random site datasets (table 1). Generally 
consistent sampling methods started in 2014 but were slightly 
modified for 2016 through 2019. Modifications from 2014 
consist of adding an estimate of total living foliar cover, 
adding a separate estimation of overhanging plant species, and 
changing from estimating multiple grain-size categories to 
grouping all grain sizes greater than 2 mm into one category.
In August and early September, randomly selected debris 
fans, channel margins, and eddy sandbars were sampled. The 
random sampling protocol aimed to sample approximately 
equal numbers of these geomorphic features within each 
floristic segment each year (table 2). Each year, a new set of 
sites were randomly selected in ArcGIS (Palmquist and others, 
2018b). Sites that are sampled are removed from the pool of 
potential sampling sites for a five-year period.

(Rkm 97 to 259); “Western GRCA random,” randomly selected sites sampled in western Grand Canyon (Rkm 259 to 404); Fixed-site sandbars, sandbars that are 
sampled annually across all river segments. “Pilot” indicates a smaller test subset of sites were sampled.]

10    Riparian Vegetation Patterns and Change Downstream from Glen Canyon Dam, 2014–2019
In late September and October, fixed-site eddy sandbars 
were sampled. These sites are locations previously identified 
for long-term geomorphic change monitoring (Kaplinski and 
others, 2014) and only include sandbars. They are a mix of 
commonly used campsites and rarely visited locations that are 
mostly located in Marble Canyon and eastern Grand Canyon. 
Two of these sites (−6 Mile in Glen Canyon and Granite 
Camp in eastern Grand Canyon) have undergone previous 
revegetation activities consisting of Tamarix removal and 
subsequent planting of native species (Ralston and Sarr, 2017). 
These sites were retained in analyses in order to fully evaluate 
riparian vegetation of the study area.
Sampling was separated by river segments related to 
geography and floristic composition: Glen Canyon (Rkm 
−25–0), Marble Canyon (Rkm 0–97), eastern Grand Canyon 
(Rkm 97–259), and western Grand Canyon (Rkm 259–404). 
The number of sites sampled per river segment is based on 
segment length, such that the maximum sampling rate is 
one sample collected per 2.5 river miles (4.1 Rkm). For the 
purpose of analysis, data from randomly selected sites and 
fixed-site sandbars were compiled for 2014 and from 2016 to 
2019. Data from 2012 and 2013 were excluded from analyses 
because of inconsistencies with data collection. As few ran­
domly selected sites were sampled in 2015, all data from that 
year were also excluded from analyses to make comparisons 
across time similar.
Individual species cover and total living foliar cover 
values are estimated within 1-square-meter (m2) quadrats 
arranged along transects and stratified by flooding frequency. 
At randomly selected sites, three transects are placed 
perpendicular to the river’s current, each with nine sample 
quadrats (for a total of 27 quadrats per site; fig. 6). At 
fixed-site sandbars, the site layout consists of a predetermined 
number of transects and quadrats based on sandbar size and 
shape. These sites can have three or four transects with six or 
nine quadrats each.

are placed on each transect.

Quadrats are stratified across the three hydrologic zones 
defined by dam operation parameters: the active channel, the 
active floodplain, and the inactive floodplain (fig. 6). Equal 
numbers of quadrats are placed in each zone.
At each quadrat, visual cover estimates of each plant 
species rooted inside the frame, each species hanging over 
the frame but rooted outside of it, and total living foliar cover 
rooted inside the frame are recorded. The latter two estimates 
were not conducted in 2014. To standardize total living foliar 
cover across all years for analyses, the variable was estimated 
by summing all cover values for recorded species.
For additional details on sample site layout and data 
collection, see Palmquist and others (2018b). Data used 
for analyses are available from the U.S. Geological Survey 
ScienceBase catalog (Palmquist and others, 2022).
Descriptive Summaries
Species Lists
Lists of recorded species were compiled for the randomly 
selected sites dataset (app. 1) and for the fixed-site sandbars 
dataset (app. 2) using the R software environment (R Core 
Team, 2021). Each list includes the number of sites at which 
each species was recorded for the study area and by river 
segment (app. 1, 2).
Community Composition
Differences in community composition (that is, 
differences in recorded species and their relative abundances) 
between geomorphic feature classes in the random sampling 
dataset and the fixed-site sandbars were assessed through 
ordination. To reduce the effect of zero-inflated data on the 
ordination results, relative abundance was quantified as the 
average cover of a species across all plots within a site and 
hydrologic zone for each year. This resulted in a total of 1,925 
site-zone-year sample points. A detrended correspondence 
analysis (DCA) was first performed using the “decorana” 
function in the R vegan package (Oksanen and others, 2015) to 
determine if the primary compositional gradient was unimodal 
or linear. The first DCA axis had a length of 7.4 standard 
deviations, indicating a unimodal gradient and supporting the 
continued use of DCA as an appropriate ordination technique. 
Statistical differences in community composition between 
geomorphic feature types, river segments, hydrologic zones, 
and years were highly significant based on both the analysis 
of variance and permutational analysis of variance of DCA 
scores (all pairwise p-values < 0.001). Thus, DCA results 
were further used for visualization and descriptive purposes. 
Differences between categories of each factor (for example, 
between the active channel and active floodplain in the 
hydrologic zone analysis) were visualized in the DCA with 
error bars reflecting two standard errors of the mean.
Species Frequency
For both randomly selected sites and fixed-site sandbars, 
the relative frequency of each species was calculated as the 
number of sites at which the species was recorded divided by 
the total number of sites (total number of randomly selected 
sites = 472; total number of fixed-site sandbars = 43). Relative 
frequency was calculated for the entire study area for both 
randomly selected and fixed sites, and for each floristic segment 
for the randomly selected sites. Relative frequency was not 
calculated by floristic segment for the fixed-site sandbars 
dataset because of the small sample sizes for some segments.
Foliar Cover
Average cover and standard deviation were calculated 
for each species by floristic segment and geomorphic feature 
(fixed-site sandbars were treated as a fourth geomorphic 
feature). Average site-level cover values for individual species 
were calculated in R by adding overhanging cover values to 
rooted cover values for each quadrat, then calculating the mean 
cover for each site. For fixed-site sandbars, average cover values 
were calculated for each year (as opposed to across years). 
Glen Canyon and Marble Canyon were combined because of 
the small sample sizes in Glen Canyon. The five species with 
the highest cover values for the randomly selected sites and 
fixed-site sandbars were graphed (see “Results” section).
To visualize differences in total cover across the study 
area, total foliar cover estimates for 2016 through 2019 
were averaged by site for the randomly selected sites and 
plotted against the corresponding river kilometer. The mean, 
maximum, minimum, and standard deviation of total foliar 
cover values were calculated for each river segment.
Temporal Trends by Hydrologic Zone
In accordance with the riparian vegetation resource goals 
outlined in the Glen Canyon Dam Long-Term Experimental 
and Management Plan, the species richness (total number of 
species), standardized proportion of native species richness 
versus nonnative species richness (number of native species 
divided by total number of species), total foliar cover (as 
percentage of quadrat), and proportion of native species cover 
versus nonnative species cover per quadrat were analyzed 
for temporal trends. Tamarix, Pluchea sericea (arrowweed), 
and Baccharis spp. were also analyzed for temporal trends, 
as these are species of management interest (U.S. Department 
of the Interior, 2016; U.S. Department of the Interior, 2020). 
For Baccharis spp. analyses, Baccharis emoryi (Emory’s 
baccharis), Baccharis salicifolia (mule fat), and Baccharis 
sarothroides (desertbroom) were grouped and analyzed 
together. These three species have similar hydrologic niches 
(Butterfield and others, 2018) and are frequent in different 
segments of the study area (Palmquist and others, 2018a). Data 
were analyzed separately for the randomly selected sites and 
fixed-site sandbar sites using mixed-effects models with site 
as a random effect. This approach was used to accommodate 
the statistical non-independence of plots within the same site. 
Initial models were conducted with hydrologic zone (active 
channel, active floodplain, and inactive floodplain), floristic 
region (Glen Canyon-Marble Canyon river segment, eastern 
Grand Canyon river segment, and western Grand Canyon 
river segment), geomorphic feature type (sandbar, debris fan, 
and channel margin), and year (2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 
12    Riparian Vegetation Patterns and Change Downstream from Glen Canyon Dam, 2014–2019
2019) as fixed effects, including all possible interactions, for 
the random sampling sites. The geomorphic feature type fixed 
effect was absent from analyses of the fixed-site sandbars. 
Year, as a fixed effect, was treated as a categorical variable 
to account for potentially strong nonlinearities in vegetation 
status among years and because of the absence of complete 
data in 2015.
Hydrologic zone consistently presented in initial 
analyses as the strongest predictor variable of most aspects 
of vegetation status. The inclusion of geomorphic feature 
and floristic region, even when significant, often did not 
result in significant differences among factor levels based 
on post-hoc analyses, and not all variables had sufficient 
data density to include all factors in a single model. For the 
sake of clarity and consistency, all models presented in this 
report are based on the interaction between hydrologic zone 
and year. Year was included in all models because of the 
explicit interest in identifying temporal trends in vegetation 
status. Mixed-effects models were conducted with the “lmer” 
function in the lme4 package in R (Bates and others, 2015) 
and Tukey’s post-hoc comparisons were conducted with the 
“emmeans” function in the emmeans package in R (Lenth and 
others, 2018).

composition differed substantially between the fixed-site 
sandbar and the randomly selected debris fan and channel 
margin sites, with random sampling sandbars intermediate 
(fig. 7). Debris fan and channel margin sites did not differ 
in composition. These differences were most strongly 
expressed along the first DCA axis. Glen Canyon, Marble 
Canyon, eastern Grand Canyon, and western Grand Canyon 
also differed in community composition. Glen Canyon 
and Marble Canyon were most similar in community 
composition. The community composition of sites in 
eastern Grand Canyon was intermediate between the 
community composition of sites in western Grand Canyon 
and that of Glen Canyon and Marble Canyon sites. 
Hydrologic zones also showed differences in plant species 
composition, with the active channel and the inactive 
floodplain exhibiting the greatest difference.
Species Frequency
The three most frequent native species were the same 
for randomly selected sites and fixed-site sandbars: Baccharis 
emoryi, Sporobolus flexuosus (mesa dropseed), and Equisetum 
x ferrissii (horsetail; tables 3, 4). Bromus species and Tamarix 
were the most frequent nonnative groups for both types of sites 
(tables 5, 6). Cynodon dactylon was frequent at both randomly 
selected sites and fixed-site sandbars but more so at the former. 
When frequency was calculated for each floristic segment, 
both native and nonnative species frequencies changed with 
respect to study-wide frequency. Some species were frequent 
throughout the corridor (B. emoryi, Tamarix, Bromus rubens), 
whereas many were only frequent in certain segments (for 
example, Artemisia ludoviciana, Euthamia occidentalis, 
Salix exigua, Pluchea sericea, Isocoma acradenia, Alhagi 
maurorum, Cynodon dactylon, Schedonorus arundinaceus).

Foliar Cover
The five species with the highest average foliar cover 
in each river segment differ for randomly selected sites 
and fixed-site sandbars (figs. 8, 9, 10). In Glen and Marble 
Canyons, the species at randomly selected sites with the 
highest average cover are Baccharis emoryi, Tamarix, 
Schedonorus arundinaceus (tall fescue), Bromus diandrus 
(ripgut brome), and Equisetum x ferrissii; for fixed-site 
sandbars, Tamarix, B. emoryi, Pluchea sericea, Phragmites 
australis (common reed), and S. arundinaceus have the 
highest average cover. In eastern Grand Canyon, the highest 
average cover species are Tamarix, B. emoryi, P. sericea, 
Baccharis salicifolia, and Cynodon dactylon for the randomly 
selected sites and P. sericea, Tamarix, B. emoryi, Salix exigua 
(coyote willow), and B. salicifolia for the fixed-site sandbars. 
In western Grand Canyon, the highest average cover species 
are C. dactylon, Baccharis sarothroides, B. emoryi, Tamarix, 
and Prosopis glandulosa for the randomly selected sites, and 
C. dactylon, P. sericea, B. emoryi, P. australis, and Tamarix 
for the fixed-site sandbars.
The four nonnative species occurring in the five highest 
cover value species also show different distributions. 
Tamarix has high living cover across all river segments and 
geomorphic features as compared to all the other species 
(table 7, figs. 8, 9, 10). Cynodon dactylon cover is close 
to zero in Glen and Marble Canyons, greater in eastern 
Grand Canyon, and high in western Grand Canyon, with 
little variation among geomorphic features in any segment 
(table 7). Schedonorus arundinaceus and Bromus diandrus

are only in the top five cover estimates for randomly selected 
features in Glen and Marble Canyons (table 7). Schedonorus 
arundinaceus has particularly high cover on debris fans and 
channel margins in Glen and Marble Canyons (fig. 8) and low 
cover elsewhere. Bromus diandrus shows little cover variation 
among geomorphic features in Glen and Marble Canyons 
(fig. 8); its cover is close to zero elsewhere.
Three native Baccharis species have different 
distributions within the study area. Baccharis emoryi has 
high cover across all geomorphic feature classes in Glen 
and Marble Canyons and at fixed-site sandbars in eastern 
Grand Canyon and western Grand Canyon, but less cover at 
randomly selected sites in western Grand Canyon (table 7). 
Baccharis salicifolia is one of the five highest cover species in 
only eastern Grand Canyon (fig. 9); it has less cover in Glen 
and Marble Canyons and western Grand Canyon. Baccharis 
sarothroides is one of the five highest cover species in western 
Grand Canyon (fig. 10), where it has similar cover across 
all geomorphic feature classes at randomly selected sites but 
slightly less cover at fixed-site sandbars. In Glen and Marble 
Canyons, however, Baccharis sarothroides has almost no 
cover and little more in eastern Grand Canyon (table 7).
Of the other native species, Pluchea sericea and 
Phragmites australis both have higher cover on fixed-site 
sandbars than randomly selected sandbars, debris fans, and 
channel margins (table 7). Pluchea sericea cover is higher in 
eastern and western Grand Canyon than in Glen and Marble 
Canyons (table 7). Phragmites australis also has higher cover 
in western Grand Canyon than elsewhere (table 7). Salix 
exigua is one of the five highest cover species on fixed-site 
sandbars in only eastern Grand Canyon (fig. 9), despite 
having higher average cover on fixed-site sandbars in Glen 
and Marble Canyons (table 7). Cover values for S. exigua in 
western Grand Canyon are close to zero. Prosopis glandulosa 
cover is greatest in western Grand Canyon.
As shown in figure 11, Glen Canyon has the highest 
average total foliar cover (29.0±12.2 percent) of all river 
segments. Marble Canyon and western Grand Canyon 
have the next highest average total foliar cover values at 
14.0±9.4 percent and 13.8±9.1 percent, respectively, and 
eastern Grand Canyon has the lowest average total percentage 
of foliar cover (8.7±6.5 percent) of the four river segments. 
Site average total foliar cover is variable within river segments, 
ranging from 9.3 to 58.1 percent in Glen Canyon, 0.1 to 37.8 
percent in Marble Canyon, 0.5 to 36.5 percent in eastern Grand 
Canyon, and 0.4 to 42.5 percent in western Grand Canyon.

Species Richness
Total species richness (average number of species 
per square meter) exhibited significant interaction effects 
between hydrologic zone and year (table 8). The main effect 
of hydrologic zone was not significant across the randomly 
selected sites, but for fixed-site sandbars, hydrologic zone had 
a much greater effect than year (see difference in F-values in 
table 8). This difference is largely due to a substantial drop 
in species richness in the active channel relative to the other 
hydrologic zones that is observed at fixed-site sandbars but 
not at randomly selected sites (fig. 12). Species richness in 
the inactive floodplain and active floodplain was generally 
lower in 2014 and 2017 than in other years, with the exception 
of comparably low species richness in the active floodplain 
of fixed-site sandbars in 2019. Species richness at randomly 
selected sites was lowest in 2014; at the fixed-site sandbars, 
species richness was lowest in 2019.

22    Riparian Vegetation Patterns and Change Downstream from Glen Canyon Dam, 2014–2019
Native species richness exceeded nonnative species 
richness, on average, across hydrologic zones and years 
except within the active floodplain and active channel at 
randomly selected sites in 2014 (fig. 13). The interactive 
effect of hydrologic zone and year was significant in both 
datasets, but the main effect of hydrologic zone was stronger 
in the randomly selected sites dataset. The year 2014 
generally showed a decrease in native species dominance in 
the randomly selected sites dataset, whereas the fixed-site 
sandbars dataset was less dominated by native species in 
2017 and 2019. In general, native species dominance was 
more pronounced at fixed-site sandbars (where it became 
increasingly pronounced in the active floodplain and active 
channel) than across randomly selected sites, though the 
proportion of native species in the active channel did increase 
through time for the randomly selected sites dataset.
Foliar Cover
The interactive effect of hydrologic zone and year on 
total foliar cover was significant in both datasets, where the 
main effect of hydrologic zone was greater than that of year 
(table 8). Cover was lowest in 2014 in the active floodplain 
and active channel of the randomly selected sites dataset, and 
lowest in 2019 in the fixed-site sandbars dataset (fig. 14). 
From 2014 through 2018, cover in the inactive and active 
floodplains was greater at the fixed-site sandbar sites than at 
the randomly selected sites, though the reduction in cover on 
the fixed-site sandbars in 2019 nullified that difference.
Native species cover exceeded that of nonnative species, 
on average, across hydrologic zones and years except within 
the active floodplain in 2014 and the active channel in 2014 
and 2016 for the randomly selected sites dataset (fig. 15). The

interactive effect of hydrologic zone and year was significant 
for the randomly selected sites but not the fixed-site sandbars. 
Hydrologic zone had the predominant main effect in the 
randomly selected sites dataset, whereas year had a stronger 
main effect in the fixed-site sandbars (table 8). This difference 
is attributable to the decline in native species dominance from 
the inactive floodplain to the active channel in the randomly 
selected sites—a pattern not observed on the fixed-site 
sandbars. The fixed-site sandbars exhibited a significant drop 
in native species dominance in the upper two hydrologic 
zones in 2017.

Species of Interest
Tamarix cover showed interactive effects of hydrologic 
zone and year, though the main effect of year was not 
significant at the randomly selected sites and was weaker than 
that of hydrologic zone in the fixed-site sandbars (table 8). 
Tamarix cover generally decreased from higher to lower

Tamarix cover at the fixed-site sandbars between 2014 and 
2016 was nullified in subsequent years by a decline in cover 
back to 2014 levels.
Pluchea sericea cover was consistently greater on the 
fixed-site sandbars at elevations above the channel (that 
is, within the inactive floodplain and active floodplain 
hydrologic zones) than at the randomly selected sites (fig. 17). 
The interaction between hydrologic zone and year was not 
significant in either dataset. The main effect of year was weak 
in the fixed-site sandbar dataset, driven by a decline in cover 
in the active channel over time.
Hydrologic zone and year had a significant interactive 
effect in both datasets on the cover of Baccharis species, with 
hydrologic zone having the stronger main effect (table 8). 
Baccharis species cover was generally higher in the active 
floodplain for both datasets, although consistent cover increase 
in the active channel of the randomly selected sites resulted 
in comparable cover between the active floodplain and 
active channel in that dataset by the end of the study period 
(fig. 18). Baccharis species cover peaked in 2016 in the active 
floodplain of the fixed-site sandbars but showed no other 
temporal trends in that dataset.

Discussion
Differences Among Sample Sites
The community composition and temporal dynamics 
of fixed-site sandbars differ throughout the study area 
from those of randomly selected sites, including randomly 
selected sandbars. The differences in composition between 
fixed-site sandbars and randomly selected sandbars may 
reflect differences in disturbance resulting from visitor use, 
differential effects of HFE releases, historical or current 
vegetation management (Ralston and Sarr, 2017; U.S. 
Department of the Interior, 2020), and (or) fundamental 
differences in grain size or geomorphic settings (Mueller and 
others, 2018). The results of this study support analyzing data 
from randomly selected sites (including randomly selected 
sandbars) and fixed-site sandbars separately for status and 
trends assessments, as well as maintaining separate monitoring 
activities for the two types of sites. Data from randomly 
selected sites represent the breadth and variability of riparian 
vegetation across multiple geomorphic features, whereas 
data from the fixed-site sandbars provide an in-depth look 
at campsites and eddy sandbars identified as key resources 
in the Glen Canyon Dam Long-Term Experimental and 
Management Plan.
One of the differences between fixed-site sandbars and 
randomly selected sites is the prevalence of Pluchea sericea 
(arrowweed). This species is notably higher in cover and 
frequency on fixed-site sandbars and is especially prevalent in 
Grand Canyon. Because of its affinity for growing at popular 
campsites, P. sericea has been implicated in the reduction of 
available campsite area within the study area (Hadley and 
others, 2018) and is now being targeted for removal from a 
few fixed-site sandbars and other campsites as part of the Glen 
Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Program triennial budget 
and work plan (U.S. Department of the Interior, 2020). Grand 
Canyon National Park staff are coordinating with GCMRC 
and Northern Arizona University scientists to implement 
non-flow-related experimental vegetation treatments to assess 
if and how vegetation removal at key sandbars can increase

and others, 2001), and rapid resprouting capabilities (Busch 
and Smith, 1993) of P. sericea make the species well suited 
for growing on highly disturbed sand deposits as well as 
in conjunction with—or following mortality of—Tamarix 
stands. HFE releases are designed to deposit sand on eddy 
sandbars with the goal of creating large, open sand deposits, 
and fixed-site sandbars are known to change rapidly in volume 
depending on flow patterns (Mueller and others, 2014). At 
the same time, Tamarix stands in the study area are being 
defoliated as a result of the tamarisk beetle (Diorhabda 
carinulata; Bedford and others, 2018), and P. sericea 
commonly grows with living and dying Tamarix (Busch and 
Smith, 1995; Hadley and others, 2018; González and others, 
2020). Conditions in the study area appear to be conducive to 
P. sericea occupancy, particularly on sandbars. It is anticipated, 
then, that this species will continue to do well in the study area.
Geographic Patterns
Floristic patterns documented in 2014 in randomly 
selected sites (Palmquist and others, 2018a) remained clearly 
delineated across years and with more intensive sampling. 
Sampling in the Glen Canyon river segment has now shown 
that randomly selected sites in Glen Canyon are floristically 
similar to randomly selected sites in Marble Canyon, although 
they are compositionally different. Glen Canyon has higher 
frequencies of plant species that are either absent or rare in 
other parts of the study area, such as Sisyrinchium demissum 
(blue-eyed grass), Juncus torreyi (desert olive), Juncus 
arcticus (arctic rush), Mentha arvensis (wild mint), Epipactis 
gigantea (stream orchid), Plantago lanceolata (narrowleaf 
plantain), and Epilobium ciliatum (fringed willowherb; see 
app. 1). These (and similar) species reflect a greater presence 
of flood-tolerant fluvial marsh species in Glen Canyon relative 
to the rest of the study area. Glen Canyon also has higher 
overall foliar cover values than the rest of the study area. These 
qualities (greater presence of fluvial marsh species and high 
foliar cover) may be the result of daily hydropower waves and 
a lack of suspended sediment within the river segment, factors 
which together produce daily inundations of very clear water 
that provide light and water to flood-tolerant species (Blindow 
and others, 1993). Because of its short length, the Glen Canyon 
river segment has a small annual sample size (consisting of 
approximately six randomly selected sites and one fixed-site 
sandbar), and data from this segment must therefore be 
grouped with data from the neighboring Marble Canyon river 
segment for some status and trend analyses.
The floristic associations that currently exist are not 
necessarily static through time. As climate, dam operations, 
and tributary flow patterns change, it is likely that species 
distributions along the Colorado River will also change 
(Capon and others, 2013; McShane and others, 2015; Perry 
and others, 2015). The current floristic groups may remain 
similar but shift geographically. For example, the desert 
riparian community in Grand Canyon may become more 
prevalent in Marble Canyon over time. Alternatively, novel 
floristic groups may emerge as individual species respond 
independently to environmental changes on the basis of 
their specific physiological traits and niche preferences 
(Hobbs and others, 2006; Catford and others, 2013). Because 
different vegetation types differentially influence sediment 
deposition (Butterfield and others, 2020), drive community 
level functional traits (McCoy-Sulentic and others, 2017a), 
and respond to hydrologic and climatic variables (Butterfield 
and others, 2018), it is important to track shifts in riparian 
vegetation communities over time.
Total riparian vegetation cover is variable across and 
within segments. Narrow sections of Grand Canyon tend 
to have lower total vegetated area, as illustrated by Sankey 
and others (2015), but a lack of habitable area should not be 
reflected in the total cover estimates provided in this report. 
The sampled area (comprising no more than twenty-seven 1-m2 
quadrats) is similar for all randomly selected sites, and quadrats 
are arranged based on the width of the hydrologic zones; 
therefore, a site that is 50-m wide can have a similar total 
foliar cover estimate as a site that is 10-m wide. The reduced 
total foliar cover exhibited in eastern Grand Canyon, then, 
is likely due to other contributing factors such as increased 
shading from canyon walls, increased flow velocity due to a 
narrower channel, coarser soil components (in other words, 
soil containing more gravels and rock), and so on. These same 
factors may be related to the high variability in total vegetation 
cover throughout the canyon, indicating strong interactions 
between river flows and other environmental variables 
(Bendix, 1994a; Butterfield and others, 2018; Butterfield and 
others, 2020). To predict vegetation response to flows and 
increase vegetation restoration success, it is important to better 
understand how river flows and other environmental variables 
jointly influence plant species in the study area.
Temporal Dynamics
The indicators used to assess management goals within 
Grand Canyon have demonstrated few directional changes from 
2014 to 2019, with observed trends primarily occurring within 
the area influenced by daily dam operations (that is, within the 
active channel). Some fluctuations in vegetation status can be 
attributed to interannual climatic variation (discussed below), 
but for some temporal variations in species of interest (for 
example, the 2016 Baccharis and Tamarix peak in the active 
floodplain of sandbars), the drivers are less evident. The status 
and trends herein provide a baseline of interannual variation 
against which future monitoring can be compared. The annual 
timesteps of the monitoring data illustrate that collecting data 
less frequently (for example, every other year) would make 
it more difficult to detect trends or be confident that observed 
patterns indicate trends in vegetation change. Additionally, less 
26    Riparian Vegetation Patterns and Change Downstream from Glen Canyon Dam, 2014–2019
frequent sampling could miss nonlinear responses to unique 
changes in dam operations (such as flows designed for trout 
management and HFE releases).
In general, vegetation status and dynamics at randomly 
selected sites differed from those at fixed-site sandbars, 
indicating that different processes regulate vegetation in these 
different geomorphic settings. For example, species richness 
is lower in the active channel of fixed-site sandbars than in the 
active channel of randomly selected sites. Another example is 
that Baccharis species are increasing in the active channel of 
randomly selected sites but not in the active channel of fixed-
site sandbars. These results imply that different management 
strategies may be necessary to obtain vegetation and recreation 
resource goals in these different settings.
Species diversity and total foliar cover showed temporal 
patterns in the active channel that were consistent with 
the overriding influence of river flows (rather than climate 
variability) on vegetation affected by daily fluctuations. 
Species richness, cover, and native species dominance 
increased over time in the active channel across randomly 
selected sites; whereas in the active channel of fixed-site 
sandbars, species richness and cover both decreased slightly 
over time, and native species dominance did not change. The 
increase in native species dominance across randomly selected 
sites reflects a shift from nonnative species dominance in 
2014, and native species dominance at randomly selected 
sites has begun to converge on the higher level of native 
species dominance that has been consistently observed in 
the active channel of the fixed-site sandbars. This increase 
in native species dominance, as well as the overall increase 
in species richness and cover across randomly selected sites, 
likely reflects the consistent flow regime and low intensity 
of disturbance over the study period, which has allowed 
establishment and expansion of more native species in the 
active channel. The increased prevalence of large native 
shrubs in the genus Baccharis is emblematic of this change.
The opposite pattern of declining species richness and 
cover in the fixed-site sandbars may reflect the combined 
impacts of hydrological and climatic factors. The lower 
species richness and cover of 2019 largely drove this trend, 
which is consistent with the combination of a HFE in the 
fall of 2018 and virtually no monsoon precipitation in 2019. 
The reduction in species richness is unlikely to be related 
to vegetation removals conducted by the National Park 
Service at the Basalt Camp and 122 Mile Camp fixed-site 
sandbars in 2019 (U.S. Department of the Interior, 2017). 
Encroaching Pluchea sericea was removed to increase usable 
camping area and facilitate increased transport of windblown 
sand to upland areas. Because of the limited number of 
sites affected, the relatively small extent of areas cleared, 
the few species removed, and the notable lack of change in 
cover of the targeted species (P. sericea), it is most probable 
that the fall 2018 HFE and the dry 2019 monsoon season 
are jointly related to the lower species richness and cover 
observed in 2019.
The active floodplain and inactive floodplain exhibited 
greater sensitivity to interannual climate variability, though 
species richness and vegetation cover appeared to be 
responsive to different aspects of precipitation. Species 
richness was generally lowest in 2014 and 2018, the years 
with the lowest total annual precipitation. Vegetation cover 
was lowest in 2014 and 2019; the latter year, though not 
particularly dry in terms of total annual precipitation, had one 
of the driest monsoon seasons in decades. In contrast, although 
2018 was dry in terms of total annual precipitation, that year’s 
monsoon season was close to average. These differing patterns 
are consistent with the influence of herbaceous, often annual 
species that make up a large proportion of the species pool 
but contribute less than woody vegetation to total ecosystem 
productivity. The apparent effect of a relatively dry 2019 
monsoon suggests that vegetation productivity is constrained 
by warm-season precipitation. The fixed-site sandbars, which 
in normal years had generally higher vegetation cover than 
the randomly selected sites, seem to have been particularly 
sensitive to the dry monsoon season in 2019. This apparent 
sensitivity could reflect the higher initial vegetative cover of 
fixed-site sandbars, which could have resulted in more intense 
competition in 2019, or it could reflect that the fixed-site 
sandbars experience more severe water deficits under dry 
conditions because of their typically coarse substrates.
Some species of interest appeared to exhibit sensitivity 
to monsoon precipitation, though the evidence is weak and 
may be conflated with effects of HFE frequency. Baccharis 
and Tamarix had peak cover in 2016 in the active floodplain 
(and Tamarix in the inactive floodplain) of fixed-site sandbars. 
Pluchea sericea had a minor increase in cover that year, as 
well, though it was not significantly different than other years. 
Precipitation during the 2016 monsoon was high following an 
average precipitation winter and spring, which may account 
for these increases in cover but does not account for these 
anomalies not being observable across the randomly selected 
sites. Another possibility is that the lack of a HFE in 2015 
allowed these woody plants to expand on the less stable 
sandbar surfaces, though a similar response was not seen in 
2018 after the lack of a HFE in 2017. Regardless, the fact that 
this anomaly was only observed on the fixed-site sandbars 
suggests an influence of either substrate type, sandbar 
reconfiguration, or both. The amount and quality of active 
floodplain and inactive floodplain habitat could have been 
quite different in 2016 because of HFE releases in the three 
consecutive years from 2012 to 2014. Further investigation of 
the effects of HFE releases on species of interest in terms of 
habitat quality and lag effects are warranted.
Riparian vegetation in the study area is expected to 
increase over time because habitat is still available and base 
flows are anticipated to remain stable (Sankey and others, 
2015; Kasprak and others, 2018; Kasprak and others, 2021). 
In an evaluation of riparian vegetation expansion between 
2002 and 2013, Durning and others (2021) showed that 
most encroachment occurred between 2002 and 2009 and 
References Cited    27
that the years from 2009 to 2013 were characterized by 
less encroachment by a smaller set of species. During the 
timeframe analyzed here (2014–2019), foliar cover does not 
appear to be increasing, suggesting that the slower rate of 
encroachment that Durning and others (2021) noted from 
2009 to 2013 is continuing. The exception to this trend is the 
increasing Baccharis spp. cover in the active channel. Durning 
and others (2021) also found that Baccharis species were one 
of the primary contributors to recent vegetation encroachment, 
so this pattern of growth is also continuing. It is likely that 
Baccharis species are driving the greater proportion of native 
species in the active channel. Baccharis emoryi is high in 
cover across all geomorphic features and is the only native 
species with cover estimates approaching those of nonnative 
Tamarix and Cynodon dactylon. Baccharis sarothroides 
is also a large contributor to vegetation cover in western 
Grand Canyon. Although P. sericea is a major contributor 
to vegetation cover on fixed-site sandbars, its cover did not 
increase from 2014 to 2019. Vegetation increases in the 
past have not proceeded consistently across years, space, 
or species in the study area and are related to river flows, 
geomorphology, and climate (Carothers and others, 1976; 
Brian, 1982; Sankey and others, 2015; Butterfield and others, 
2018; Mueller and others, 2018; Butterfield and others, 2020; 
Durning and others, 2021). Determining the flow patterns that 
lead to one species increasing in cover and (or) frequency 
while the cover and frequency of others remain the same 
would improve our abilities to predict the trajectory of riparian 
vegetation change and help define useful management actions.
The riparian area of the Colorado River between Glen 
Canyon Dam and Lake Mead is currently undergoing a visible 
change in its native to nonnative species ratio. Diorhabda 
carinulata (tamarisk beetle) has been present in the ecosystem 
since at least 2009 and, as of 2013, affected approximately 
15 percent of Tamarix (Bedford and others, 2018). Over 
the timeframe covered here, monitoring efforts have not 
recorded significant decreases in living Tamarix cover, despite 
observable defoliation events. In this study, defoliated and 
fully healthy Tamarix are recorded similarly, so only tree 
mortality would be observable. Repeated defoliation events 
weaken Tamarix and can eventually result in tree mortality, 
but limb loss and resource depletion occur first (Bean and 
Dudley, 2018). Thus, considering 85 percent of Tamarix had 
not been affected by the tamarisk beetle in 2013, it is likely 
that Tamarix mortality is not yet recordable. The efforts of this 
monitoring protocol (which records dead Tamarix; Palmquist 
and others, 2018b) and periodic overflights (which can 
successfully track Tamarix defoliation and mortality; Bedford 
and others, 2018) are together expected to be able to track the 
effects of the tamarisk beetle on Tamarix cover over time.
The metrics used to track key riparian vegetation qualities 
(species richness, native to nonnative species ratio, total foliar 
cover) are promising for tracking management goals in the 
face of changing climate and flow conditions. These metrics 
are not dependent upon specific species and compositions; 
rather, they are simply related to the total number of species, 
the number of native species, and areal cover. The apparent 
lack of importance of both geomorphic feature and floristic 
region in the mixed-effects models of vegetation metrics 
(species richness, native to nonnative species ratio, total 
foliar cover) means that they can be evaluated across the 
entire study area (and thus do not require that the study area 
be divided into multiple river segments). Any future species 
distribution shifts will not necessarily change the outcome of 
these metrics, so values will be comparable over time. Shifts 
in species richness, native to nonnative species ratios, and total 
foliar cover can indicate if species are being lost over time, 
if nonnative species are predominating, or if total vegetation 
cover is declining or increasing. Although species composition 
is important because of the ecosystem services provided 
by specific species, measures of species richness, native to 
nonnative species ratios, and total foliar cover can provide 
a simple assessment of vegetation status that is useful for 
assessing the state of riparian vegetation along the Colorado 
River between Glen Canyon Dam and Lake Mead over time.
