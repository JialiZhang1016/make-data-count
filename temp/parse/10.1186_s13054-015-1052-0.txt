Abstract
Introduction: Experimental data from animal models of sepsis support a role for a transcription factor, nuclear
erythroid-related factor 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2), as a master regulator of antioxidant and detoxifying genes and
intermediary metabolism during stress. Prior analysis of a pediatric septic shock transcriptomic database showed
that the Nrf2 response is a top 5 upregulated signaling pathway in early pediatric septic shock.
Methods: We conducted a focused analysis of 267 Nrf2-linked genes using a multicenter, genome-wide expression
database of 180 children with septic shock 10 years of age or younger and 53 healthy controls. The analysis
involved RNA isolated from whole blood within 24 h of pediatric intensive care unit admission for septic shock and
a false discovery rate of 5 %. We compared differentially expressed genes from (1) patients with septic shock and
healthy controls and (2) across validated gene expression–based subclasses of pediatric septic shock (endotypes A
and B) using several bioinformatic methods.
Results: We found upregulation of 123 Nrf2-linked genes in children with septic shock. The top gene network
represented by these genes contained primarily enzymes with oxidoreductase activity involved in cellular lipid
metabolism that were highly connected to the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor and the retinoic acid
receptor families. Endotype A, which had higher organ failure burden and mortality, exhibited a greater
downregulation of Nrf2-linked genes than endotype B, with 92 genes differentially regulated between endotypes.
Conclusions: Our findings indicate that Nrf2-linked genes may contribute to alterations in oxidative signaling and
intermediary metabolism in pediatric septic shock.
Introduction
The prevalence of pediatric septic shock is rising [1–3],
and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and sec-
ondary infections are leading causes of morbidity and
mortality among children admitted to the pediatric in-
tensive care unit (PICU) [4, 5]. Mitochondrial bioener-
getic dysfunction and immunoparalysis are thought to
play major roles in sepsis-associated deaths [6–9]. Meta-
bolomic analyses of adults [10, 11] and children [12]
suggest that cells fail to generate adequate energy to
supply increased metabolic demands during sepsis,
and this phenomenon is associated with mortality in
adults [10, 11]. Oxidative stress is strongly linked to
the mitochondria and is a hallmark of sepsis-associated
MODS [13–15].
Evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction in pediatric sep-
tic shock is supported by a recent report that nuclear-
encoded mitochondrial genes are differentially expressed
early in pediatric septic shock compared with healthy con-
trols and across septic shock endotypes [16]. Moreover,
direct measurements of mitochondrial respiration de-
monstrated decreased bioenergetic reserve and increased
mitochondrial uncoupling in peripheral blood mono-
nuclear cells of children with early sepsis [17]. Mitochon-
drial uncoupling is directly regulated by reactive oxygen
species (ROS) production and glutathionylation status of

the uncoupling proteins that regulate ROS production
and influence cell signaling [18].
A mechanistic link between sensing of oxidative stress,
immune dysregulation, and mitochondrial bioenergetic
failure can be made with a nuclear transcription factor,
nuclear erythroid-related factor 2 p45-related factor 2
(Nrf2) [19, 20]. Under conditions of increased oxidative
stress, Nrf2 facilitates upregulation of genes involved in
the antioxidant response [19]. Specifically, Nrf2 pro-
motes a gene expression profile that directs glycolytic
intermediates through the pentose phosphate pathway
(PPP) to generate reducing equivalents, such as nicotina-
mide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrate (NADPH),
used by glutathione (GSH) and thioredoxin to combat
oxidative stress. In addition to restoring cellular redox
balance, Nrf2 directly regulates cellular energy metabol-
ism by modulating substrate availability for mitochon-
drial respiration [19, 20]. Prior studies have also shown
that loss of Nrf2 leads to mitochondrial depolarization
with a resultant decrease in cellular ATP levels, whereas
genetic activation of Nrf2 increases the efficiency of
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation [20]. Finally, in
an Nrf2-knockout mouse model, exposure to lipopoly-
saccharide or cecal ligation and puncture induced higher
levels of lung inflammation, proinflammatory gene ex-
pression, and mortality compared with wild-type mice
[21]. Analysis of an established genome-wide expression
database of children with septic shock [22] demonstrated
that the Nrf2 oxidative stress response pathway is upreg-
ulated in children with septic shock [23].
We sought to further investigate the differential expres-
sion of Nrf2-linked genes by performing a focused analysis
of a U.S. multisite genome-wide expression database of
children with septic shock [22]. In our directed approach,
we focused on 267 genes linked to the Nrf2 pathway. The
genes were selected on the basis of existing literature
[19, 24–28]. We hypothesized that expression of whole
blood–derived, Nrf2-linked genes would be differentially
regulated between pediatric patients with septic shock
within the first 24 h of presentation to the PICU and
healthy controls. We further hypothesized that Nrf2 path-
way genes would be differentially regulated between two
endotypes of pediatric septic shock, defined by differential
expression of genes involved in adaptive immunity and
glucocorticoid receptor signaling and that have previously
been shown to have distinct clinical phenotypes (endo-
types A and B) [29].
Material and methods
Patients and data collection
The study protocol was approved by the institutional re-
view boards of each participating institution. The name of
each institutional review board corresponds to the name of
each respective institution: Cincinnati Children’s Hospital
Medical Center, The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia,
University of California Benioff Children’s Hospital
Oakland, Penn State Hershey Children’s Hospital, Chil-
dren’s Mercy Hospital, Children’s Hospital of Orange
County, Akron Children’s Hospital, Children’s National
Medical Center, Miami Children’s Hospital, Texas Chil-
dren’s Hospital, and C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital at the
University of Michigan. Children 10 years of age or youn-
ger admitted to the PICU who met pediatrics-specific
criteria for septic shock were eligible for enrollment [30].
Age-matched controls were recruited from the ambula-
tory departments of participating institutions using pub-
lished inclusion and exclusion criteria [31]. All subjects,
including controls, and the data collection methods have
been previously reported in microarray-based studies ad-
dressing hypotheses entirely different from that of the
present study, and details of the study protocol were
previously published [32]. All microarray data have
been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology
Gene Expression Omnibus database (accession numbers
[GEO:GSE26440] and [GEO:GSE26378]).
RNA extraction and microarray hybridization
Written informed consent to participate in this study
was obtained from the parents or legal guardians of all
children with septic shock and all control subjects. Blood
samples were obtained within the first 24 h of meeting
criteria for septic shock. Total RNA was isolated from
whole blood using the PAXGene Blood RNA System
(PreAnalytiX, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland). Microarray
hybridization was performed as previously described using
the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
(Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) [31].
Nrf2-linked gene selection
Nrf2-linked genes chosen for our focused analysis were
derived from data compiled in independent studies that
used microarray analyses and chromatin immunoprecip-
itation with massively parallel DNA sequencing (ChIP-
Seq) experiments [19, 24–28; and references therein].
We identified 267 genes linked to Nrf2, as defined by
Nrf2 target genes containing putative antioxidant response
elements or xenobiotic response elements in their pro-
moter regions and genes that directly or indirectly regu-
late expression of Nrf2. These 267 genes correspond to
566 gene probes on the GeneChip Human Genome U133
Plus 2.0 Array, as shown in Additional file 1: Table S1.
Data analysis
We analyzed existing normalized microarray data. The
original analyses were performed using one patient
sample per chip. Image files were captured using a Gen-
eChip Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix). Raw data files (.CEL)
were subsequently preprocessed using robust multiarray

average (RMA) normalization and GeneSpring GX 7.3
software (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA).
All signal intensity–based data were used after RMA
normalization, which specifically suppresses all but sig-
nificant variation among lower-intensity probe sets [33].
All chips representing septic shock samples were then
normalized to the respective median values of controls
on a per-gene basis.
Differences in mRNA abundance between study groups
were determined using Welch’s t test and corrections for
multiple comparisons using a Benjamini-Hochberg false
discovery rate (FDR) of 5 %. We did not include predeter-
mined fold expression filters in the analysis, because the
biological implications of a specific threshold change in
our target gene set have not previously been established.
Thus, to account for the possibility that even a modest
change in the expression of genes from a common meta-
bolic pathway could yield dramatic variability in flux
through that pathway [34], we reported all significant
differences in gene expression using the 5 % FDR in this
analysis. For clarity, further details regarding microarray
data analysis and gene list generation are provided in the
Results section.
Gene lists of differentially regulated genes were analyzed
using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) application
(Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA, USA) to explore
potential associations with specific domains of Nrf2 func-
tion. IPA is a database generated from peer-reviewed
scientific publications that provides a tool for discovery
of signaling pathways and gene networks within the
uploaded gene lists. Adjunct analyses of gene lists were
conducted using the ToppGene application [35].
Gene expression mosaics representing the expression
patterns of differentially regulated genes were generated
using the Gene Expression Dynamics Inspector (GEDI)
[36]. GEDI produces expression mosaics recognizable
via human pattern recognition. The algorithm for creat-
ing the mosaics is a self-organizing map to depict com-
plex genomic data.
Ordinal and continuous clinical variables not normally
distributed were evaluated by analysis of variance on
ranks. Dichotomous clinical variables were analyzed
using a χ2 test (SigmaStat software; Systat Software, San
Jose, CA, USA).
Results
Differential regulation of Nrf2-linked genes in patients
with septic shock versus healthy controls
We first determined how many gene probes were dif-
ferentially regulated between children with septic shock
(n =180) and healthy control pediatric subjects (n =53).
The demographic characteristics of the two study groups
were reported previously by Weiss et al. [16]. We con-
ducted a Welch’s t test starting with all 54,675 gene
probes on the array and corrected for multiple compari-
sons using a Benjamini-Hochberg FDR of 5 %. There
were 23,912 gene probes differentially regulated between
children with septic shock and healthy control pediatric
subjects.
We then conducted a Venn diagram analysis to deter-
mine how many of the 566 gene probes corresponding
to the Nrf2-linked genes were found in this list of 23,912
differentially regulated gene probes. This analysis yielded
281 gene probes corresponding to 178 unique genes, of
which 123 were upregulated and 55 were downregulated
in children with septic shock relative to controls. The
complete list of differentially expressed Nrf2-linked genes
is provided in Additional file 2: Table S2.
Uploading the 281 differentially regulated Nrf2-linked
gene probes to the IPA platform resulted in the top 5–
scoring canonical pathways listed in Table 1. The gene
network shown in Fig. 1 demonstrates that the differen-
tially regulated Nrf2-linked genes are enriched for genes
encoding enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism and
are connected to the peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor (PPAR) and retinoic acid receptor-α families. The
network genes are listed in Additional file 3: Table S3. A
majority of these genes are upregulated in septic shock
relative to controls. Importing the network genes from
IPA to the ToppGene platform returned “oxidoreductase
activity” as the top molecular function and “cellular lipid
metabolism” as the top biological process.
Differential expression of Nrf2-linked genes across
endotypes of pediatric septic shock
We next determined whether the Nrf2-linked genes
were differentially regulated across previously validated
gene expression-based subclasses of pediatric septic shock:
endotype A and endotype B [29]. The clinical and demo-
graphic data for the patients in septic shock endotype A
(n =60) and endotype B (n =160) have been previously

published by Weiss et al. [16]. Patients with endotype A
have a higher mortality rate, Pediatric Risk of Mortality
score, and pediatric sepsis biomarker risk model–based
mortality risk, as well as the maximum number of organ
failures, compared with patients in endotype B.
We first determined how many gene probes were dif-
ferentially regulated between endotype A and endotype
B patients. We conducted a Welch’s t test starting with
all 54,675 gene probes on the array and corrected for
multiple comparisons using a Benjamini-Hochberg FDR
of 5 %. There were 11,630 gene probes differentially reg-
ulated between endotype A and endotype B patients.
We then conducted a Venn diagram analysis to deter-
mine how many of the 566 gene probes corresponding
to the Nrf2-linked genes were found in this list of 11,630
differentially regulated gene probes. This analysis yielded
138 gene probes corresponding to 92 unique genes, of
which 40 were upregulated and 52 were downregulated

The complete list of differentially expressed Nrf2-linked
genes is provided in Additional file 4: Table S4.
We used the GEDI program to build gene expression
mosaics to provide a global representation of the 92 dif-
ferentially expressed genes in endotype A and endotype B
patients. The GEDI mosaics in Fig. 2 illustrate that endo-
type A patients exhibited a greater repression of Nrf2-
linked genes (higher proportion of blue color intensity)
than endotype B patients.
Among the 92 differentially expressed genes, the top 5
canonical pathways from IPA are shown in Table 2. The
top scoring gene network among these differentially reg-
ulated genes is shown in Fig. 3. The network genes are
listed in Additional file 5: Table S5. Uploading the net-
work genes to the ToppGene platform analysis returned
“glutathione binding” as the top molecular function and
“response to oxidative stress” as the top biological process
for network 1. The second top scoring gene network
among these differentially regulated genes is shown in
Fig. 4. The network genes are listed in Additional file 6:
Table S6. Uploading these network genes to the Topp-
Gene analysis platform returned “superoxide-generating
NADPH oxidase activity” as the top molecular function
and “superoxide metabolic process” as the top biological
process for network 2.
Discussion
The Nrf2 pathway has been shown in previous micro-
array analyses of pediatric sepsis to be in the top 5 sig-
naling and metabolic pathways upregulated in whole
blood–derived RNA, with 24 genes represented [23].
The present study delves more deeply into the discovery
of Nrf2-linked genes as a critical pathway in pediatric
sepsis. We found differential expression of Nrf2-linked
genes in children with septic shock compared with
controls and that the Nrf2-linked genes showed a greater
degree of repression in endotype A subjects, who tend to
have the most organ dysfunction and highest mortality.
Nrf2 plays a role in degradation of triglycerides and/or
phospholipids and enzymes involved in fatty acid oxida-
tion. In addition, Nrf2 negatively regulates many genes
encoding enzymes involved in lipid biosynthesis, fatty
acid desaturation, and fatty acid transport through un-
known mechanisms [19]. Langley and colleagues per-
formed a metabolomic study of adults with septic shock
and demonstrated that fatty acid transport, β-oxidation,
gluconeogenesis, and the citric acid cycle pathways are
all differentially regulated in non-survivors compared
with survivors of septic shock [11]. Specifically, lactate,
pyruvate, α-ketoglutarate, oxaloacetate, and acyl-carnitine
are all higher in the plasma of sepsis non-survivors than
in sepsis survivors [11], purportedly owing to an inability
of sepsis non-survivors to harness energetic substrates for
aerobic catabolism [11]. Rogers et al also performed meta-
bolomic analysis of critically ill adults using the same
cohort as that analyzed by Langley et al and noted that, of
the 31 metabolites that differentiated survivors from non-
survivors, the six metabolites that were lower in the
patients who died were a part of the lipid metabolism

mosaics. Red intensity correlates with increased gene expression, and blue intensity correlates with decreased gene expression. Clear differences in
color patterns illustrate differential expression of Nrf2-regulated genes across patient endotypes A and B, with general downregulation in endotype A.

pathway [10]. Mickiewicz and colleagues performed nu-
clear magnetic resonance analysis of metabolites in chil-
dren with sepsis compared with healthy control children
and found an increase in three compounds (2-hydroxybu-
tyrate, 2-hydroxyisovalerate, and lactate) that are associ-
ated with enhanced fat breakdown resulting in ketoacid
and lactic acid production owing to increased energy
demands during septic shock [12]. Our data are consistent
with these previous studies and, overall, support the
concept that pediatric septic shock is characterized by al-
terations in the expression of genes essential for oxidative
stress responses and lipid metabolism.
Concurrent measures of oxidative stress and metabol-
ite data are not available to determine how the observed
Nrf2 pathway gene expression changes might alter the
total antioxidant status, fatty acid metabolism, and ATP
production in early pediatric sepsis. It is likely that
changes in intermediary metabolism and oxidative state

affect Nrf2-linked gene expression, and researchers in
future studies should measure the effects of oxidative
stress, metabolite concentration, and flux through vari-
ous metabolic pathways influenced by Nrf2, such as gly-
colysis, the citric acid cycle, the PPP, fatty acid oxidation,
and fatty acid synthesis.
The present study is constrained by the fact that we
limited the analysis to 267 genes linked to Nrf2, as
determined by previous human and murine studies.
Linkage was defined as either genes regulated by Nrf2 or
genes that regulate Nrf2 function. It is certainly possible
that our selection method excluded some relevant genes.
Limiting our working gene list in this manner is a poten-
tial source of bias. We attempted to mitigate this bias by
conducting the initial statistical analyses, with correc-
tions for multiple comparisons, using all gene probes

available on the array. We subsequently searched the
resulting gene lists for our selected Nrf2 genes and
found that many of these genes were differentially regu-
lated when we considered all available gene probes.
Conclusions
Nrf2-linked genes involved in cellular lipid metabolism
were predominantly upregulated early in pediatric septic
shock compared with healthy controls. Genes corre-
sponding to the oxidative stress response mediated by
GSH-binding enzymes and NADPH-oxidase generation
of superoxide were predominantly downregulated in a
distinct, previously defined endotype of pediatric septic
shock having higher organ failure burden and mortality.
Our findings indicate that Nrf2-linked genes may con-
tribute to alterations in oxidative signaling and inter-
mediary metabolism in pediatric septic shock. Studying
the temporal changes in expression of Nrf2 pathway genes
and correlation of gene expression with metabolomic ana-
lysis of intermediary metabolites should provide insight
into the energy and oxidative states of children over the
time course of sepsis. We propose that future work should
be focused on the hypothesis that differential regulation of
Nrf2-linked genes may be an important mechanism con-
tributing to the host ability to combat oxidative stress and
reprogram metabolic pathways to provide necessary en-
ergy to survive childhood sepsis and MODS.
