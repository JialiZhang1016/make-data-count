Abstract
The discovery of vitamins and clariﬁcation of
their role in preventing frank essential nutrient deﬁciencies
occurred in the early 1900s. Much vitamin research has
understandably focused on public health and the effects of
single nutrients to alleviate acute conditions. The physio-
logical processes for maintaining health, however, are
complex systems that depend upon interactions between
multiple nutrients, environmental factors, and genetic
makeup. To analyze the relationship between these factors
and nutritional health, data were obtained from an
observational,
community-based
participatory
research
program of children and teens (age 6–14) enrolled in a
summer day camp in the Delta region of Arkansas.
Assessments of erythrocyte S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)
and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), plasma homocysteine
(Hcy) and 6 organic micronutrients (retinol, 25-hydroxy
vitamin D3, pyridoxal, thiamin, riboﬂavin, and vitamin E),
and 1,129 plasma proteins were performed at 3 time points
in each of 2 years. Genetic makeup was analyzed with 1 M
SNP genotyping arrays, and nutrient status was assessed
with 24-h dietary intake questionnaires. A pattern of
metabolites (met_PC1) that included the ratio of erythro-
cyte SAM/SAH, Hcy, and 5 vitamins were identiﬁed by
principal component analysis. Met_PC1 levels were sig-
niﬁcantly associated with (1) single-nucleotide polymor-
phisms, (2) levels of plasma proteins, and (3) multilocus
genotypes coding for gastrointestinal and immune func-
tions, as identiﬁed in a global network of metabolic/pro-
tein–protein interactions. Subsequent mining of data from
curated pathway, network, and genome-wide association
studies identiﬁed genetic and functional relationships that

Introduction
Phenotypic differences between individuals result from
heterogeneous genetic makeups sharing the same envi-
ronment
and
between
genetically
similar
individuals
exposed to different environments. For example, the inci-
dences of obesity and related metabolic disorders among
ancestral groups sharing the same environment differ
(Ramos and Rotimi 2009; Bustamante et al. 2011) while
Pima Indians have different incidences of obesity in
Mexico versus the United States (Schulz et al. 2006). A
large number of studies have identiﬁed gene–environment
interactions based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) and nutrient intake (Fenech et al. 2011; Lee et al.
2011; Ordova´s et al. 2011), and recent genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) have identiﬁed SNPs associ-
ated with dietary preference (Hamza et al. 2011; Tanaka
et al. 2013). These gene–nutrient association studies and
GWAS identiﬁed individual SNPs that explain only a small
fraction of the phenotype (i.e., small effect size) (Goldstein
2009). The focus on individual SNPs, copy number vari-
ations (CNVs), or other single genomic structural varia-
tions
(e.g.,
insertion/deletions
or
INDELS)
is
based
implicitly on the one gene–one enzyme hypothesis of
Beadle and Tatum (Beadle and Tatum 1941). Their
experimental paradigm revolutionized biomedical research
by demonstrating that a mutation in a single gene could
eliminate enzyme activity and produce a change in phe-
notype. However, they described biological processes more
holistically in the introduction of that landmark paper:
‘‘…Since the components of such a [sic] system are
likely to be interrelated in complex ways, and since
the synthesis of the parts of individual genes are
presumably dependent on the functioning of other
genes, it would appear that there must exist orders of
directness of gene control ranging from simple one-
to-one relations to relations of great complexity’’
(Beadle and Tatum 1941). (Emphasis added)
Systems thinking and methodologies hold greater promise
in understanding the complex phenotypes of chronic
disease or response to nutrients in foods than the focus
on individual genetic variants or the identiﬁcation of
independent environmental factors (Patel et al. 2010,
2012a, b) that inﬂuence biological processes. An increasing
number of reports employ systems designs and analysis of
high-dimensional data from studies of obesity, cardiovas-
cular, nutrition, diabetes, drug, toxicology, immunology,
gut microbiota, medicine, health care, and health dispar-
ities (Slikker et al. 2007; Auffray et al. 2009; Gardy et al.
2009; Kalupahana and Moustaid-moussa 2011; Kleemann
et al. 2011; Roux 2011; Karlsson et al. 2011; Afacan et al.
2012; Meng et al. 2013).
With the exception of several publications that include
dietary intake variables as a part of omics-based systems
(Morine et al. 2010, 2011, 2012) or genomic analysis
(Nettleton et al. 2010), many systems studies have
implicitly analyzed biological processes as closed systems
since environmental variables were not included in the
analysis. Biological processes occur in open systems (Von
Bertalanffy 1950), and ex vivo factors, which include
nutrients and other naturally occurring chemicals in food,
can alter biochemical processes and signaling networks
occurring within the organism (Kaput and Rodriguez
2004). Excluding external factors that inﬂuence internal
biological processes generates an incomplete system at
best, likely an inaccurate understanding of the interactions
between environment and genetic makeup, and from a
practical standpoint, misses an opportunity to identify
modiﬁable factors that inﬂuence health.
This report details the design and conduct of a discov-
ery-based pilot study that accounts for (1) the known
genetic uniqueness of individual humans (Olson 2012), (2)
the intra-individual variability in homeostatic measure-
ments (Williams 1956; Illig et al. 2010; Suhre et al. 2011),
and (3) the challenge of characterizing complex pheno-
types resulting from small contributions of many genetic
and environmental factors (Goldstein 2009). The partici-
pants in the Delta Vitamin Obesity intervention study were
children and teens (age 6–14) enrolled in a summer day
camp that was a component of a community-based par-
ticipatory research (CBPR) program. CBPR is a form of
translational research that engages the participant, mem-
bers of the community, and scientists in research, educa-
tion,
and
health-promoting
activities
for
improving
personal and public health (McCabe-Sellers et al. 2008). A

analysis such as metabolite and protein variation in relation
to BMI, sex, and age has been reported (Monteiro et al.
2014).
In this report, analysis of the data from the Delta Vita-
min Obesity (Monteiro et al. 2014) is extended to further
characterize metabolite–metabolite interactions with dis-
covery-based methods that identify systems-wide rela-
tionships between metabolites, proteins, nutrient intakes,
and genetic makeup. Principal component analysis (PCA)
was used to analyze plasma homocysteine (Hcy); vitamins
A, D, E; riboﬂavin; thiamine; pyridoxal; and erythrocyte S-
adenosylmethionine and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH)
metabolites. A quantitative variable (met_PC1) from the
PCA was deﬁned and used for discovering metabolite–
protein correlations as well as thousands of genotypes
associated with met_PC1 values. Two recent studies have
used
inferences
based
on
heritability
and
Bayesian
approaches to identify thousands of SNPs associated with
height and weight (Hemani et al. 2013) and rheumatoid
arthritis (Stahl et al. 2012) to demonstrate that complex
phenotypes are the result of thousands of SNPs. Subsequent
data mining methods associated genes and proteins iden-
tiﬁed in this report to biological functional classes includ-
ing predominantly immune and gastrointestinal function.
Finally, the challenges of conducting case–control studies
in light of genetic and cultural differences within and
between populations are discussed.
Materials and methods
Participants and CBPR methods
A description of the summer day camp in the Marvell,
AR (USA) school district, 24-h dietary intakes, body
weight and height, blood sampling and processing, and
proteomic
and
genomic
analysis
are
provided
in
(Monteiro et al. 2014). In brief, assessments were con-
ducted before the beginning of the camp (baseline), at
the end of 5 weeks of the camp (end of camp), and
1 month after camp ended (post-camp). Metabolite and
dietary intake data were averaged across the three
assessments for the analysis in this study. Thirty-six
participants were recruited in year 1, and 19 completed
all three assessments. In the second year, 72 participants
enrolled and 42 completed three assessments. None of
the children or adolescents (age 6–14) was taking pre-
scribed medicines, nor did they have overt malnutrition,
active infection, or known genetic disease that could
alter metabolism. All participants were healthy African
American children and adolescents. Results for the three
assessments are reported. The biomedical research pro-
tocol was approved by the FDA’s Research Involving
Human Subjects Committee (RIHSC) and the University
of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) Institutional
Review Board (IRB).
HCY
Total Hcy was analyzed in plasma using a Hcy HPLC Kit
(ALPCO Immunoassays, Salem, NH) and a UPLC Waters
Acquity HSS T3 column (2.1 9 50 mm, 1.8 lm) coupled
with an Acquity HSS T3 1.8 lm VanGuard pre-column at
40 C.
Lipid-soluble vitamins
Vitamins were determined using LC/MS/MS (NCTR-FDA-
USA): 250 lL of plasma, in a 1.5-mL Eppendorf micro-
centrifuge tube, was spiked with stable isotope-labeled
standards and mixed with 740 lL of MeOH. Samples were
held at 4 C for 30 min. About 500 lL of hexane was
added, and samples were centrifuged at 13,0009g for
12 min (4 C). The (top) hexane layer was transferred into
a total recovery autosampler vial, and the sample was
subsequently extracted with two additional 500 lL hexane
portions, each time transferring the hexane layer into the
autosampler vial. The combined hexane extracts were
placed under a stream of nitrogen gas, dried, and recon-
stituted in 50 lL of 50:50 MeOH/ACN. Ten microlitre
sample was injected on an Acquity UPLC equipped with a
2.1 mm 9 50 mm (1.7 lm particle) BEH C18 column
held at 35 C. The mobile phase A was 90:10 water/ACN,
and the mobile phase B was 50:50 MeOH/can with a ﬂow
rate of 0.5 mL/min. Metabolites were analyzed on a Xevo
TQ operated in positive APCI ionization mode using the
following parameters: source temperature was 145 C,
corona was 15 uA, probe temperature was 575 C, and
desolvation gas ﬂow rate was 600 L/h. Multiple reaction
monitoring (MRM) was optimized by direct infusion of
standards. The transitions monitored for vitamin A were
m/z 269 ? 109 (cone E = 35 V, collision E = 15 V) and
m/z 269 ? 93 (cone E = 26 V, collision E = 14 V). The
transition monitored for vitamin E was m/z 431 ? 165 and
for (d3) vitamin E was m/z 434 ? 165 (cone E = 35 V,
collision
E = 15 V).
The
transition
monitored
for
25-hydroxy
vitamin
D3
was
m/z
401 ? 159
and
m/z 407 ? 159 for the (d6) 25 hydroxy vitamin D3 with
cone and collision energies of 24 and 28 V, respectively.
Water-soluble vitamins
About 250 lL of plasma was mixed with 1 mL of (4 C)
acetonitrile in a 1.5-mL Eppendorf microcentrifuge tube.
The sample was vortexed brieﬂy and then centrifuged at
13,0009g for 10 min at 4 C. The supernatant was

transferred to a total recovery autosampler vial, and the
solvent was evaporated. Samples were reconstituted in
250 lL of water (Optima grade), and 10 lL of sample was
injected onto an Acquity UPLC equipped with an HHS T3
2.1 9 100 mm, (1.8 lm particle) UPLC column. Mass
spectrometric detection was performed on a Xevo TQ
(Waters) operated in ESI positive mode using the following
parameters: source temperature was 150 C, capillary
voltage (kV) was 2.2, desolvation temperature was 400 C,
and desolvation gas ﬂow rate was 800 L/h. MRMs for
target analytes were optimized by direct infusion of stan-
dards.
The
transition
monitored
for
pyridoxal
was
m/z 168 ? 94 (cone E = 16 V, collision E = 22 V), for
pyridoxine m/z 170 ? 134 (cone E = 22 V, collision
E = 22 V), for thiamine m/z 265 ? 122 (cone E = 20 V,
collision E = 12 V), for riboﬂavin m/z 377 ? 243 (cone
E = 40 V,
collision
E = 22 V),
and
for
folic
acid
m/z 442 ? 295 (cone E = 22 V, collision E = 12 V).
Red blood cell S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) and S-
adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH)
Red blood cell samples stored at -70 C were randomly
assayed in batches of 20. About 600 lL of red blood
cells was added to tubes containing 150 lL of ice-cold
trichloroacetic acid (40 % w/v), plus 330 lL 0.1 M
sodium acetate trihydrate, and then vortexed. Samples
were incubated at 4 C for 30 min, followed by centri-
fugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min. About 150 lL of
supernatant was ﬁltered using a 0.22-lm ﬁlter, spun at
5,000 rpm for 5 min, and transferred to vials for chro-
matographic analysis of SAM. The remainder of the
supernatant was transferred to a clean tube for ether
extraction. Samples were extracted twice with 300 lL,
and any remaining ether was evaporated under argon
before ﬁltration and transferred to UPLC vials for the
analysis of SAH. Standards for SAM and SAH were
obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Chromatographic
separation was achieved on an Acquity HSS T3 column
(2.1 9 50 mm, 1.8 lm) coupled with an Acquity HSS
T3 1.8 lm VanGuard pre-column at 40 C. The peaks
were separated isocratically with an elution time of
5.0 min for SAM and 2.0 min for SAH at 97 % A
(buffer) and 3 % B (methanol). The buffer composition
for SAM was 50 mM potassium phosphate and 10 mM
heptane sulfonic salt adjusted to pH 4.38 with phos-
phoric acid. The composition for the SAH mobile phase
was 50 mM potassium phosphate. Column equilibration
time required for SAM was 90 min, while equilibration
time
for
SAH
was
just
30 min
at
ﬂow
rates
of
0.575 mL/min. Buffers and solvents are ﬁltered using
0.22-lm ﬁlters prior to use. Samples were held at 4 C
for the duration of the analysis. The injection volume
for samples and standard was 10 lL. Detection was
performed with a photodiode array detector set to
monitor wavelengths 210–400. Standard was prepared in
a range from 0.78 to 25.00 pmol/lL for SAH and from
0.32 to 10.40 lL for SAM. A standard curve was gen-
erated to allow for automated calculation of results
using the Waters Empower software.
Proteomics
The plasma proteome was quantiﬁed for 110 samples from
6 different time points (3 in year 1 and 3 in year 2) but data
from 61 at time point 1 were used in these analyses due to
missing samples. SomaLogic Inc. (Boulder, CO) per-
formed all proteomic assessments and was blinded to the
clinical characteristics of participants in this study. Sam-
ples were analyzed as previously described (Gold 1995;
Brody and Gold 2000; Gold et al. 2010; Ostroff et al. 2010;
Brody et al. 2012).
Genomic analysis
DNA preparation
About 1 mL of whole blood sample from each participant
was used for DNA extraction. The genomic DNA samples
were extracted and puriﬁed using the QIAamp DNA Blood
Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA), following the protocol
provided by the manufacturer. The quality and quantity of
each DNA samples were measured using a NanoDrop 8000
(Thermo Scientiﬁc, Wilmington, DE). The Inﬁnium Whole
Genome Genotyping technology with the HumanOmni1-
Quad version 1.0 kits (Illumina, San Diego, CA) was used
for genotyping analyses following the manufacturer’s
protocol. The arrays were scanned on a high-resolution
iScan (Illumina) and processed using the BeadStudio
software version 3.1 (Illumina). The overall genotyping
call rate on all samples was above 98 %. Data from 45
unique participants (15 participants attended both years)
met these criteria.
Preprocessing of genotyping data
Raw SNP data were ﬁrst preprocessed, removing SNPs
with a GC score\0.7, and those that were not genotyped in
all participants. SNPs with minor allele frequency\0.1 and
those signiﬁcantly diverging from Hardy–Weinberg equi-
librium were also removed. The remaining SNPs were
ﬁltered to include only those present in the metabolic/
protein–protein interaction (PPI) network used in the ana-
lysis, resulting in a ﬁnal dataset of 125,959 SNPs.

Network analysis
A metabolic/PPI network was constructed based on the
human interaction networks manually curated databases
(Ma et al. 2007; Yu et al. 2012). The largest connected
component of this network comprised 116,210 interactions
between 13,705 genes, containing 125,959 SNPs present on
the Illumina 1 M Quad Array. The network was partitioned
into topological modules using the spinglass.community
function in the igraph library in R (Csardi and Nepusz
2006) resulting in 58 topological modules (mean module
size: 236 nodes; SD: 564 nodes).
SNP-, gene-, and network-level analyses
Signiﬁcant correlations between genotype and met_PC1
levels were assessed in each SNP using generalized
estimating equations (GEE), as implemented in the
geepack library in R (Højsgaard et al. 2006). Met_PC1
was modeled as a function of genotype at each SNP
locus, controlling for age, gender, average Healthy
Eating Index, and sibling relationships among the par-
ticipants (the latter being included as an independence
correlation structure in the GEE models). Although
some participants attended both years of the camp, only
one genotype per participant was used in this analysis.
Resulting p values were corrected for multiple testing
using the procedure proposed by Benjamini and Hoch-
berg (1995). Nominal p values were used as input for
the VEGAS algorithm, which accounts for size, level of
polymorphism, and linkage disequilibrium relationships
within genes to determine genewise p values from SNP-
level results (Liu et al. 2010). Genes reaching signiﬁ-
cance (q \ 0.1) were used in hypergeometric tests
(implemented using the HTSanalyzeR library in R) to
determine signiﬁcant enrichment of each of the 58
modules
in
the
interaction
network.
Modules
with
q value \0.1 were considered as signiﬁcantly enriched
in genes related to micronutrients. In order to assess the
biological processes that may be directly or indirectly
implicated by genetic variation in our met_PC1 genes,
the functional proﬁle of each signiﬁcant module was
determined using the ClueGO (Bindea et al. 2009)
plugin for Cytoscape. ClueGO functional proﬁles illus-
trated in Fig. 6 and Supplementary ﬁles include KEGG
pathways that are signiﬁcantly overrepresented among
module nodes, using hypergeometric tests and correct-
ing p values using the Benjamini and Hochberg method
(see Bindea et al. 2009) for technical details on the
generation of functional proﬁle networks.
Signiﬁcant genes were also analyzed in the context of
the ArrayTrack QTL database (Harris et al. 2009; Xu et al.
2010) to determine signiﬁcantly overrepresented QTL
phenotypes. Gene sets were constructed by combining all
genes within 1 Mbp of QTL mapping to each of the 36
phenotypes (containing at least one signiﬁcant gene from
our analysis) in the ArrayTrack database. Hypergeometric
tests were then performed to identify which QTL pheno-
types were signiﬁcantly enriched in the signiﬁcant genes
from our analysis.
Results
PCA of metabolite levels
Mean plasma levels of metabolites (Hcy; riboﬂavin; pyri-
doxal; thiamine; and vitamins A, D, E) and erythrocyte
SAM/SAH are illustrated with hierarchical clustering in
Fig. 1a. This analysis revealed that individuals (represented
in rows) with higher SAM/SAH tended to have higher
plasma levels of fat-soluble vitamins A and D and medium
or low plasma levels of vitamin E, thiamine, and pyridoxal.
Individuals with low SAM/SAH tended to have the oppo-
site patterns of these metabolites.
Given the strong patterns of correlation among the
plasma metabolites, PCA was used to identify latent
metabolite
variables.
The
ﬁrst
principal
component
(met_PC1) explained 41 % (Fig. 1b, c) of the variation in
metabolite proﬁle and stratiﬁed the participants primarily
based on their levels of vitamin A, Hcy, SAM/SAH, thia-
mine, pyridoxal, and vitamin E. Vitamin D and riboﬂavin
contributed
to
the
second
principal
component
and
explained 5 % of the variation (Fig. 1b, c) in the dataset.
To our knowledge, these nutrient–nutrient associations
have not been previously reported and would not have been
identiﬁed by standard single-variant analysis. Although
met_PC1 is a continuous variable, the analysis and heat
map indicate metabolic patterns that could be used to group
individuals for different nutritional interventions.
Proteomic associations with metabolite patterns
Plasma levels of 1,129 proteins in baseline samples were
analyzed using SomaLogic DNA aptamer technology
(Kraemer et al. 2011; Gold et al. 2011). Robust linear
regression identiﬁed 51 proteins signiﬁcantly associated
with the met_PC1 variable at p \ 0.1 corrected for multi-
ple
comparisons
(Fig. 2;
Supplement
1).
Values
of
met_PC1 corresponding to high vitamin A, Hcy, SAM/
SAH were negatively correlated with well-studied proin-
ﬂammatory proteins, such as CSF1, TNFSF15, C3, SELE,
and CD86. These proteins had a weak positive correlation
with met_PC1 corresponding to high levels of vitamin E,
pyridoxal, and thiamine.

Correlation analysis and hierarchical clustering pro-
duced two main branches differing in the percentage of
plasma-soluble and membrane proteins versus cytosolic
proteins (Fig. 2; see brackets at bottom). We previously
observed two clusters of blood versus cytosolic proteins
associated with erythrocyte SAM/SAH ratios (Monteiro
et al. 2014). The cytosolic proteins in the blood were likely
produced by apoptotic processes, although the current data
cannot discriminate between normal and pathological cell
death.
Genetic analyses
Analysis of genotype–metabolite correlations
within a global protein interaction network
Micronutrients
and
their
associated
metabolites
are
involved in a larger network of interactions than can be
identiﬁed by metabolic pathway tools or pairwise regula-
tory or protein–protein interactions. The Edinburgh human
metabolic network and a second manually curated inter-
action database (Ma et al. 2007; Yu et al. 2012) were used
to construct a global network of metabolic and protein–
protein interactions (Fig. 3). The largest connected com-
ponent of this network comprised 116,210 interactions
between 13,705 genes. This global network was subse-
quently partitioned into topological modules using a heu-
ristic
approach
to
topological
partitioning
based
on
simulated annealing (Reichardt and Bornholdt 2006). The
resulting global network consisted of 58 topological mod-
ules with mean module size of 236 nodes (minimum
module size: 2; maximum size: 2351). Topological mod-
ules are loosely analogous to biological pathways in that
they represent functionally cohesive groups of interacting
genes/proteins, and as such they provide a partitioning of
the overall network into biological subsystems to be used
as a framework for the omics data analysis. The advantage
of network modules as an alternative to pathways is that
they capture the inherent overlap and intersection between
canonical pathway models.
The genes in the global interaction network collectively
contained 125,959 SNPs represented on the 1 M Quad
Array after preprocessing genotyping data. To associate the
network to the experimental data, the met_PC1 was mod-
eled as a function of genotype at each SNP locus using
general estimating equations (GEE), controlling for age,
sex, average Healthy Eating Index score, and sibling rela-
tionships among the participants (Fig. 4). A total of 3234
SNPs were signiﬁcantly correlated with met_PC1 after
correction for multiple testing (adjusted p \ 0.05; Sup-
plement 2). An example of the genotype results using the
top 50 most signiﬁcant SNPs is shown in Fig. 5, which
shows differences in genotypes across met_PC1 values.
The complex combination of all identiﬁed SNPs contrib-
utes to met_PC1 values, which are composed of 5 metab-
olites and SAM/SAH. Others have concluded that complex
phenotypes result from the contribution of thousands of
SNPs, each with low effect size (Stahl et al. 2012; Hemani
et al. 2013).

Nominal p values were used as input for the VEGAS
algorithm, which accounts for size, level of polymorphism,
and linkage disequilibrium relationships within genes to
determine genewisep valuesfromSNP-levelresults(Liu etal.
2010). The result was 1,875 statistically signiﬁcant genes
associated with the met_PC1 variable, which were unevenly
distributed among 46 of the 58 modules (Supplement 3).
Hypergeometric tests (see ‘‘Materials and methods’’
section) were used to test for signiﬁcant overrepresentation
of met_PC1 genes and met_PC1 proteins with q \ 0.1 in
each of the 58 modules. No modules were signiﬁcantly
enriched in met_PC1 proteins; however, four modules
(Table 1) were found to be signiﬁcantly enriched in genes
related to the met_PC1 variable using a q value of\0.1 for
the module. Module 45 had ten genes, of which four were
signiﬁcantly associated with met_PC1. These were the
intracellular-localized proteins coproporphyrinogen oxi-
dase (CPOX) and high-mobility group protein 1 (HMG1)
and two plasma membrane-associated proteins sarcoglycan
zeta (SGCZ) and sphingomyelin synthase 1 (SGMS1).
Biological interpretation of this module is difﬁcult as these
10 genes are signiﬁcantly overrepresented in a set of
functionally distinct pathways (porphyrin and chlorophyll
metabolism, viral myocarditis, arrhythmogenic right ven-
tricular cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,
dilated cardiomyopathy). Although the cardiac function
pathways are potentially interesting, developing a strong
hypothetical relationship between module function and
nutritional health is difﬁcult with such a small number of
genes. Hence, the remaining discussion will focus on

modules 52, 2, and 18. Each module was also tested for the
enrichment of genes that interact with, metabolize, or are
regulated by the metabolites measured in this study
(Monteiro et al. 2014). These ‘‘micronutrient neighbor-
hoods’’ (275 genes in total) were identiﬁed in the MetaCore
database (version 6.10, build 31731) as all genes that
directly interacted with metabolites measured in this study.
The neighborhood may be considered a distinct level or
subsystem between a pathway (e.g., the one-carbon path-
way) and the modules within the global network. Under-
standing the entire system requires knowledge from the
single reaction, pathway, neighborhood, and integrated
network. Three modules of the 58 in the network were
statistically
enriched
in
these
micronutrient
genes
(Table 2). Notably, module 18 was enriched in both the
met_PC1 genes (Table 1), and the neighborhood genes
(Table 2) linked to the metabolites measured in the study,
thus indicating that it contains both statistical associations
with micronutrient levels and also known functional asso-
ciations with micronutrients.
Functional and genetic analyses of statistically signiﬁcant
genes and modules
In order to assess the biological processes that may be
directly or indirectly implicated by genetic variation in our
met_PC1 genes, the functional proﬁle of each signiﬁcant
module was determined using data mining tools including
the ClueGO plugin in Cytoscape (Bindea et al. 2009), the
KEGG pathway database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/
pathway), ArrayTrack QTL (Xu et al. 2010) database, and
literature mining. All pathways described in the ClueGO
analysis results were signiﬁcantly overrepresented in the
given module (adjusted p value \0.05).
Module 18: Functional annotation
Based on KEGG pathway annotations, the genes in Module
18 (Fig. 6) included about 80 % of the pyrimidine pathway
genes and similar percentages for purine, nicotinamide, RNA
polymerase,
riboﬂavin,
and
collecting
duct
secretion
Fig. 3 Conceptual approach for gene selection. The analysis focused
on SNPs within genes with known functional association with the
metabolites (orange rectangles) measured in the study. This was
accomplished by mining all genes from the MetaCore database with a
direct functional connection to any of these metabolites. This resulted
in 275 unique genes, designated as micronutrient neighbor genes
(black balls). In parallel, a global metabolic/PPI interaction network
was partitioned into topological modules. Modules that were signif-
icantly enriched in micronutrient neighborhood genes were deﬁned as
micronutrient systems

processes (Supplement 3,Module column and Supplement 4).
Parts of these pathways and processes may be found in other
modules since the simulated annealing algorithm optimizes
local interactions and does not consider the boundaries
between pathways, as they exist in pathway databases.
Graphical representation of the KEGG pathways in
Module 18 provides a deeper view of the processes rep-
resented in this module (Fig. 6; Supplement 4, Bar-
Graph18). Speciﬁcally, a cluster of Module 18 nodes
includes genes that function in salivary, bile, pancreatic,
and gastric acid secretion processes, such as ADCY1,
GAST, and KCNJ1. Processes related to secretion func-
tions, speciﬁcally gap junction structures, calcium and
chemokine signaling pathways, and vascular smooth mus-
cle contraction, are also strongly represented in this section
of Module 18. Several pathways and networks involved in
DNA repair processes are found in this module. The rela-
tionships of genes associated with met_PC1 with gastro-
intestinal function are illustrated the KEGG gastric acid
secretion pathway shown in Fig. 7. Genes signiﬁcantly
correlated with met_PC1 are highlighted in yellow. Rep-
resentative samples of SNP genotype differences in
ADCY1, PRKCA, and KCNJ1 are shown in the boxplots
(Fig. 7a–c). These results suggest that genetic variation in
these genes may cause dynamic variation in gut function,
which may alter plasma micronutrient levels.
Module 2: Functional annotation
Module 2 is functionally enriched in immune function path-
ways and processes inﬂuenced by or involved in infectious
diseases (Supplement 4, Barograph). Over 70 % of the genes
involved in complement/coagulation pathways are found in
this pathway. In addition, disease pathways affected by
inﬂammation such as Alzheimer’s, type 1 diabetes, and
rheumatoid arthritis are also represented in this module.
Proteomic analysis of blood proteins demonstrated the asso-
ciation between a combination of metabolites including
micronutrients
(met_PC1)
and
inﬂammatory
processes
(Fig. 2).
Fig. 4 Methodological approach to the correlation of genotype and
metabolite proﬁle via network analysis. Metabolite data were ﬁrst
summarized by a single principal component and compared to each
SNP (gray boxes) in the genetic dataset using GEE. Nominal p values
from the GEE analysis (SNPs in red boxes) were used as input to the
VEGAS algorithm to determine gene-level p values from SNP-level
data (red lines indicate a gene with multiple SNPs, black line with
single SNPs). Signiﬁcant genes were then mapped to the global
interaction network and considered as ‘‘hits’’ in hypergeometric tests
of each topological module in the network

BarGraph52) with cytokine signaling and other immune
pathways overlapping with Module 2. The secretory and
absorption pathways in Module 18 also have components
in Module 52. About 75 % of the phosphatidylinositol and
inositol phosphate pathways involved in proliferation,
survival, migration, and differentiation in different cell
types
including
the
development
and
regulation
of
B-lymphocyte and T-lymphocyte functions (So and Fru-
man 2012) are found in Module 52. Functional analysis
also highlights the known links between diabetes and
immune function, since type 1 and type 2 diabetes genes
and pathways and *50 % of the insulin signaling pathway
occur in Module 52.
Quantitative trait loci mapping and cofactor analyses
The mapping to functional systems described above associ-
ates variation in met_PC1 with a wide range of biological
processes consistent with the role of cofactors in enzymatic
reactions, structural components of enzymes and proteins,
and regulatory processes. Another approach to associate a
gene with a phenotype is to determine the gene’s chromo-
somal location relative to genomic regions contributing to
polygenic phenotypes identiﬁed by quantitative trait loci
(QTL) and GWAS data (Kaput et al. 1994, 2004). In many
cases, GWAS identify the most likely candidate genes within
a region that might explain some aspect of the phenotype

represent metabolites. Genes that were signiﬁcantly correlated with

being studied. However, in the absence of direct genetic or
biochemical experimental data, other genes in the QTL and
GWAS regions may also contribute to the phenotype studied.
Genes signiﬁcantly correlated with met_PC1 were used as
search terms in the ArrayTrack (Harris et al. 2009) QTL tool
(Xu et al. 2010) to identify those that overlap with a 1M-bp
region containing the QTL contributing to 36 phenotypes,
selected based on physiological relevance to this study. A
large number of met_PC1 genes overlapped with QTL for
these 36 phenotypes; however, only QTLs for body weight,
serum apolipoprotein E, serum leptin, and serum lipid levels
were statistically enriched with these genes (q \ 0.15).
Met_PC1 genes mapping to these signiﬁcant phenotypes are
shown in Fig. 8 (listed in Supplement 5).
Lists of statistically signiﬁcant genes alone, in modules, or
mappedtoQTLs identify potentialcandidate genes for a given
phenotype. However, biological processes are necessarily
controlled by gene–environment interactions. To associate
the genes identiﬁed by data mining methods with nutrients,
GeneCards and EBI’s cofactor database were searched for
each ofthe genes mapping to QTLs for plasmalevels ofleptin,
adiponectin,glucose, and for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)
loci. Many of the statistically signiﬁcant met_PC1 genes that
mapped to these loci had a metal cofactor, and only a few
required organic cofactors (not shown). For example, CD320,
the transcobalaminreceptor, mapped to the GLUCO3_H QTL
(glucose level) on chromosome 19. LRP2, which is involved
in vitamin uptake, mapped to a chromosomal region (GLU-
CO15_H on chromosome 2) associated with hyperglycemia.
Several met_PC1 genes (CHKA which is involved in choline
metabolism; NOX4, TM7SF2, ALDH3B1, NDUFS8 are
associated with NADPH) mapped to serum adiponectin level
QTLs. Two genes (SHMT1, cofactors pyridoxal phosphate
and folate; ALDH3A2–NADPH) mapped to serum leptin
QTLs on chromosome 17. DNMT3B mapped to a serum
cholesterol QTL and to a T2DM susceptibility locus on
chromosome 20.
The limited ability to measure gene expression, protein
levels, or enzyme activities in the appropriate tissues often
prevents testing the contribution of a gene to a phenotype.
Proteins in blood may be surrogates or involved in speciﬁc
phenotypes. Eight of the 51 proteins correlated with met_PC1
(Fig. 2) mapped to 11 different QTLs (Table 3). While six of
these proteins may be released from damaged cells for
unknown reasons in the healthy state, two proteases normally
found in the plasma were associated with body weight
(KLK11, C1S), serum cholesterol (C1S), and APOE levels,
blood pressure, and susceptibility to COPD (KLK11). Plau-
sible biochemical explanations could be made for their par-
ticipation in these phenotypes due to their enzymatic activities
but further genetic and biochemical studies are necessary to
test whether they are involved in these conditions.
Discussion
Health and disease processes result from a complex inter-
action between multiple genes and environmental factors.

The systems nutrition analyses reported here used data
from dietary intakes, plasma and erythrocyte metabolite
levels, plasma proteins, and genetic makeup in a cohort of
children/teens aged 6–14. Discussed below are (1) the main
biological results, (2) strategy and methodological con-
siderations, and ﬁnally, (3) implications for health and
disease research.
Biological ﬁndings
Met_PC1 and SAM/SAH
Principal component analysis (PCA) identiﬁed a metabolite
pattern, met_PC1, with positive and negative correlations
between plasma micronutrients, plasma Hcy, and SAM/
SAH ratio in erythrocytes. Plasma vitamin A and Hcy
correlated positively with SAM/SAH, and vitamin E, thi-
amine, and pyridoxal correlated negatively in this popula-
tion. While statistical associations do not prove causality,
these correlations suggest that micronutrients and metab-
olites operate within a network that includes SAM/SAH
metabolism. Altering the proportion of metabolites relative
to each other may alter methylation potential and therefore
epigenetic reactions. Others have shown that SAM/SAH
correlated with differences in methylation at metastable
epialleles based on season and food availability (Waterland
et al. 2010). Changes in epigenetic programming at critical
developmental windows such as in utero, early childhood,
or during puberty have been associated with developmental
plasticity, health, and susceptibility to chronic diseases in
adults (Barker et al. 1993; Gluckman et al. 2009; Kuss-
mann et al. 2010).
Met_PC1 and plasma proteins
Met_PC1 was also associated with levels of pro-inﬂam-
matory proteins. Individuals with high vitamin A, Hcy (but
still below the clinical cutoff of 15 lmol/L), and SAM/
SAH had lower levels of many of these inﬂammatory
proteins. The correlation was modest for any single protein
to met_PC1 value. However, certain proteins shared simi-
lar correlation coefﬁcients and functional analysis based on
gene ontologies, and some of these correlated proteins that
participated in the same networks. Since met_PC1 is an
empirically deﬁned value speciﬁc to this study, the corre-
lations among these plasma metabolites will necessarily
require testing in other genetic makeups and environments.
Met_PC1 and global protein topological analysis
To discover whether the met_PC1 variable was associated
with genetic variation in molecular interaction networks or
subsystems,
a
metabolic/protein–protein
interaction
network was constructed based on two manually curated
interaction databases (Ma et al. 2007; Yu et al. 2012). The
network was partitioned into topological modules, each of
which
was
assessed
for
signiﬁcant
enrichment
with
met_PC1-correlated genes using a hypergeometric test.
Three modules were identiﬁed, 2 of which contained sub-
stantial numbers of immune and metabolic function genes
and the third included genes in a range of secretory and
gastrointestinal functions. Although the met_PC1 genes
were not directly functionally annotated to every one of the
identiﬁed processes/pathways in these modules, they may
either be directly contained in these processes/pathways, or
indirectly connected via a small number of degrees of
separation. Variation in plasma micronutrient levels and
Hcy, and erythrocyte SAM and SAH, and speciﬁcally the
ratios of these metabolites relative to each other, was
associated with genetic variations in immune and gastro-
intestinal functions. Chronic disturbance in gastrointestinal
function (such as that seen in inﬂammatory bowel disease,
Crohn’s disease, and environmental enteropathy) may
directly contribute to micronutrient deﬁciencies due to
altered
nutrient
absorption
(Valentini
et
al.
2008).
Although the cohort in the present study did not present
with diagnosed intestinal disorders, it may be the case that
a range of SNPs contributes to subclinical variation in
gastrointestinal function, which then relates to variation in
micronutrient levels. Additional focused work on entero-
cytes and intestinal immune cells would be required to
clarify the potential functional consequences of the SNPs
identiﬁed in this study.
Metabolite principal component 1 (Met_PC1) was
derived from the relationship of vitamins A, E, thiamine,
pyridoxal, and the metabolites Hcy, SAM/SAH ratio.
Correlations of met_PC1 to immunity were not unexpected
since a rich literature exists for individual micronutrients
and various aspects of immune function and regulation
(Bhaskaram 2002; Maggini et al. 2007; Baeke et al. 2010;
Stro¨hle et al. 2011; Ooi et al. 2012). The genetic analysis
nevertheless revealed new insights into the many genes and
their functions that may be associated with different plasma
levels of metabolites and therefore with diet.
Strategy and methodological considerations
The experimental design included several uncommon
approaches for human nutritional studies:
1.
The use of CBPR with biomedical and network
biology analyses. Community-based research engages
participants in the research study and provides oppor-
tunities for health- and nutrition-related exchanges
between community members and researchers. Com-
munity-based research is done in ‘‘real’’ time with
Genes Nutr (2014) 9:408

408
123
lifestyle and other environmental conditions that are
not under the control of the researcher. These factors
likely introduce noise into the study and analyses, but
the measured biological ‘‘signals’’ include the contri-
bution from those unmeasured inﬂuences. Our goal
was to measure as many physiological and environ-
mental variables as possible to associate signals with
phenotype. In addition, community-based results from
such studies are likely to be translated more rapidly to
individuals and populations (McCabe-Sellers et al.
2008).
2.
Data from this study were previously analyzed at the
group level (such as between SAM/SAH groups) and
at the population level (Monteiro et al. 2014). We have
also extensively analyzed dietary intake patterns,
metabolomics, proteomic, and genomic data for indi-
vidual participants in this study. For example, dietary
intake variables were compared to metabolite patterns
in each participant to determine whether common
patterns could be identiﬁed at the individual level, and
DNA ancestry was analyzed for each individual for the
possibility of using genetic admixture mapping meth-
ods (Cheng et al. 2010) (data not shown). Methods
which identify groups of individuals with related
metabolic features but still allow for n-of-1 analysis
may extend the recent personal omics analysis for
molecular and medical phenotypes (Chen et al. 2012).
Reporting data and results from studies with more than
one individual, however, may require development of
novel publication strategies.
3.
Levels of metabolites in each participant were analyzed
and shown in one ﬁgure as opposed to reporting results
of the average metabolite level in separate graphs.
Although such methods are common in transcriptomic
and metabolomics literature, we identiﬁed patterns of
metabolite levels that revealed unanticipated nutrient–
nutrient statistical interactions. Standard PCA con-
verted the graphic representation of metabolite levels to
a statistic speciﬁc called metabolite principal compo-
nent 1 (met_PC1). Met_PC1 represented 6 strongly and
one weakly associated (vitamin D) measured metabo-
lites and their interactions. Although the value of this
statistic is speciﬁc for the study reported here, similar
methods may allow for more comprehensive analyses
of interacting metabolites.
4.
Analyzing genetic differences based on met_PC1 in a
metabolic/PPI network partitioned into topological
modules allowed for the identiﬁcation of physiological
functions (immune, metabolic, and secretory) associ-
ated with gene–metabolite relationships identiﬁed in
our statistical analysis. Rather than seeking a small
number of SNPs with large effect on our phenotype,
our network-based approach inherently highlights
multivariate groups of functionally related SNPs/genes
that are statistically associated with a phenotype.
Deﬁned interventions can be developed from our
results and, equally importantly, tested by measuring
parameters of immune and GI function that were
identiﬁed in this study.
Although the limiting aspect of the study reported here is
the small sample size (45 genetically unique individuals
with 61 sets of metabolite, protein, and diet variables), the
combination of these methodological approaches may
provide new strategies for genomic and nutrigenomic
studies. Expanded sample size will be particularly impor-
tant for genetic analysis in order to avoid exceedingly small
sample sizes for minor alleles, as we observed at times in
our genetic analysis.
Implications for reproducibility
The results described in this manuscript and recent pub-
lications on intra-individual variability in physiological
status found in environments that have large changes in
nutrient availability (Dominguez-Salas et al. 2013) dem-
onstrate the difﬁculty in replicating biomedical research,
particularly for genetic and gene–environment interaction
associations. Hierarchical clustering of proteins (Fig. 2)
and SNPs (Fig. 5) correlated with met_PC1 helps visual-
ize the proteomic and genotypic differences as combina-
tions of SNPs or proteins rather than as single markers
(even though these were derived from univariate analysis
and corrected for multiple comparisons). No single protein
or SNP is always correlated with met_PC1. This is what
we would expect to observe, in part because of gene–gene
and gene–environment interactions, epigenetic regulation,
and other interactions. This perspective better ﬁts the
biological reality of multiple genes and their products
contributing
to
a
complex
phenotype
(in
this
case
met_PC1). Our working hypothesis is that testing these
associations in other populations and also in others
experimental designs would be needed to identify com-
mon patterns of variants within these genotype data sets
that might explain the percentage of genetic contribution
to a given phenotype. Subsets of genes will contribute or
not contribute to a complex phenotype (e.g., obesity and
diabetes) based on interactions with diet or other envi-
ronmental factors. In addition, the adaptations to diverse
environments over human evolution may have selected
different collections of genes for similar environments in
different environments. The most notable, and still con-
troversial example, is the different functional adaptations
to Tibetan and Andean high altitudes (Beall 2007). Nev-
ertheless, we predict that gene–environment interactions
producing the same phenotype will have overlapping
408

genes (much like Venn diagrams). Some pathways and
therefore genes will be shared, and others may contribute
less signiﬁcantly in different genetic subpopulations.
Discovering these similarities and differences may lead to
an understanding of targeting diet and lifestyles to opti-
mize health.
