Abstract
Background: In recent years, increasing evidences have indicated that long non-
coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are deeply involved in a wide range of human biological
pathways. The mutations and disorders of lncRNAs are closely associated with many
human diseases. Therefore, it is of great importance to predict potential associations
between lncRNAs and complex diseases for the diagnosis and cure of complex
diseases. However, the functional mechanisms of the majority of lncRNAs are still
remain unclear. As a result, it remains a great challenge to predict potential
associations between lncRNAs and diseases.
Results: Here, we proposed a new method to predict potential lncRNA-disease
associations. First, we constructed a bipartite network based on known associations
between diseases and lncRNAs/protein coding genes. Then the cluster association
scores were calculated to evaluate the strength of the inner relationships between
disease clusters and gene clusters. Finally, the gene-disease association scores are
defined based on disease-gene cluster association scores and used to measure the
strength for potential gene-disease associations.
Conclusions: Leave-One Out Cross Validation (LOOCV) and 5-fold cross validation
tests were implemented to evaluate the performance of our method. As a result, our
method achieved reliable performance in the LOOCV (AUCs of 0.8169 and 0.8410
based on Yang’s dataset and Lnc2cancer 2.0 database, respectively), and 5-fold cross
validation (AUCs of 0.7573 and 0.8198 based on Yang’s dataset and Lnc2cancer 2.0
database, respectively), which were significantly higher than the other three
comparative methods. Furthermore, our method is simple and efficient. Only the
known gene-disease associations are exploited in a graph manner and further new
gene-disease associations can be easily incorporated in our model. The results for
melanoma and ovarian cancer have been verified by other researches. The case
studies indicated that our method can provide informative clues for further
investigation.

Background
About 3% of the human genome is the coding region, which produces multiple pro-
teins, and other non-coding regions transcribe a large number of non-coding RNAs.
Much of the non-coding region of the human genome has historically been regarded as
junk DNA [1]. However, for decades, researchers have discovered that multiple types of
RNA exist, and among the most important is non-coding RNA (ncRNA). According to
transcript lengths, ncRNAs could be further categorized into small ncRNAs and
lncRNAs [2]. LncRNAs are the biggest part of non-coding RNAs which are longer than
200 nucleotides and are not translated into proteins [3, 4]. It is estimated that about 62%
of the human genome is transcribed to produce long non-coding RNAs. Compared with
protein-coding transcripts, lncRNAs have fewer exons and are expressed at lower levels
[5, 6]. However, lncRNAs show extensive mechanisms to play their biological roles com-
pared to small ncRNAs [7]. As shown by more and more studies that lncRNAs play cru-
cial functional roles in cytoplasm and nucleus through cis or trans-regulatory
mechanisms [6], and play important roles in different cellular pathways [8, 9].
In recent years, with the rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technolo-
gies, researchers have identified many lncRNAs in eukaryotic organisms. For example,
Cabili et al. integrated chromatin marks and RNA-sequencing data to identify more
than 8000 long intergenic ncRNAs across 24 different human cell types and tissues
[10]. And accumulating evidences have shown that mutations and disorders of
lncRNAs are closely related to many complex human diseases [11]. The earliest
lncRNAs to be discovered were XIST [12] and H19 [13]. These two genes have been
demonstrated to be linked to several types of cancers. For example, One of the first
lncRNAs to be identified, H19, acts as a decoy for several tumor suppressor miRNAs,
with let-7 [14]. Another important discovery of lncRNAs is that the lincRNA termed
HOTAIR is increased in expression in primary breast tumors and metastases, and
HOTAIR expression level in primary tumors is a powerful predictor of eventual metas-
tasis and death [15]. Yan et al. comprehensively analyzed the characteristics of lncRNAs
in different types of human cancers at the genome, transcription and epigenetic levels
[16]. The results indicated that lncRNAs are more specific than mRNAs in expression
and dysregulation in different cancers [16]. With regard to liver cancer, Yang et al. not
only analyzed the dysregulated lncRNAs, but also inferred its pathogenesis by combin-
ing methylation and copy number variation [17]. Due to their functional significance,
various databases have been developed to store lncRNA related information, such as
lncRNAdb [18], NONCODE [5], including the information of lncRNA structure, ex-
pression, and so on. LncRNADisease [19], Lnc2Cancer [20] are mainly focused on dif-
ferent lncRNA-disease associations. These databases are crucial for deciphering
lncRNA functions in human diseases. However, the functions and biological relevance
of the vast majority of lncRNAs remain enigmatic.
Recently, the functions of lncRNAs and their associations with human diseases have
attracted much attention from researchers because increasing evidences indicated that
lncRNAs play critical roles in the development of various human diseases. With the de-
velopment of novel experimental and computational methods, researchers have pro-
posed a variety of models to predict the biological functions of lncRNAs and lncRNA-
disease associations. For example, Chen et al. constructed a computational tool named
LRLSLDA to predict novel human lncRNA-disease associations [21]. It is well known
Yuan et al. BMC Bioinformatics          (2020) 21:180 
Page 2 of 14
that LRLSLDA is the first lncRNA-disease association prediction model which is based
on the assumption that the functions of lncRNAs associated with similar diseases are
often similar. A semi-supervised learning framework of Laplacian Regularized Least
Squares was mainly applied in this model. As a result, LRLSLDA significantly improved
the performance of previous methods used to solve the similar computational biology
problems. Based on the basic assumption that similar diseases tend to have associations
with functionally similar lncRNAs, more computational models were developed, such
as LNCSIM [22] and LDAP [23]. LNCSIM calculated lncRNA functional similarity on a
large scale based on lncRNA-disease associations and disease semantic similarity. LDAP
was proposed to predict potential lncRNA-disease associations by using a bagging SVM
classifier based on lncRNA similarity and disease similarity. Furthermore, some models
were developed by integrating multiple data sources into networks. In 2015, Guo et al.
developed a reliable method named lncGFP [24] based on a global network strategy to
predict probable functions of lncRNAs at large scales, which may give clues to the po-
tential associations between lncRNAs and diseases. Sun et al. proposed a computational
method named RWRlncD [25] by implementing random walk with restart (RWR) on
the lncRNA functional similarity network. Chen et al. developed model named
IRWRLDA [26] which combined lncRNA expression similarity and disease semantic
similarity to set the initial probability vector of the RWR to predict novel lncRNA-
disease associations. Yang et al. constructed a coding-non-coding gene-disease bipartite
network based on the known gene-disease associations and uncovered the hidden
lncRNA-disease associations by implementing a global propagation algorithm on this
network [27]. Chen et al. developed a model called KATZLDA by integrating known
lncRNA-disease associations, lncRNA expression profiles, lncRNA functional similarity,
disease semantic similarity and Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity to uncover
potential lncRNA-disease associations [28]. Furthermore, KATZLDA could work for
both new diseases and lncRNAs. Due to few known lncRNA-disease associations, some
researchers have developed methods that rely on other information besides the known
lncRNA-disease associations. For example, Liu et al. identified potential lncRNA-
disease associations based on known gene-disease associations and gene-lncRNA co-
expression relationships which was the first computational method without the need to
rely on known lncRNA-disease associations [29]. All the lncRNA-disease association
prediction models aforementioned were listed in the Table S1(see Additional file 1).
In this paper, a simple and efficient method was developed to predict novel lncRNA-
disease associations. First, a bipartite network is constructed by integrating known
lncRNA-disease associations and protein-coding gene-disease associations. Then the
concept of disease clusters and gene clusters is presented in the bipartite network. The
key idea behind this method is that the nodes in one part associated with the same
node in another part are more similar with each other, which is similar to the assump-
tion used by other methods [22, 23, 26]. Based on the above, we proposed a new
method to calculate association scores for potential gene-disease pairs. Cross-
Validation tests were used to evaluate the performance of our method. As a result, our
method obtained reliable AUCs of 0.8169, 0.8410 in the LOOCV based on Yang’s [27]
dataset and Lnc2Cancer 2.0 [30] database, respectively. We further implemented 5-fold
cross validation on our method and obtained reliable AUCs of 0.7573, 0.8198 based on
Yang’s dataset and Lnc2Cancer 2.0 database, respectively. The performance of our

method was superior to other similar methods on the two datasets. Moreover, case
studies on melanoma and colon cancer demonstrated that it could give clues to further
investigations.
Results
Prediction of lncRNAs associated with diseases
For the gene-disease pairs without edges in the bipartite network, our method can cal-
culate an association score for a pair which can be used to measure the potential asso-
ciation strength of this gene-disease pair. Ultimately, we sorted the association scores
of all potential gene-disease pairs and selected the top 1% as predicted results, and ob-
tained a total of 2320 potential gene-disease associations (1321 lncRNA-disease pairs
and 999 protein coding gene-disease pairs) (see Additional file 2).
Performance evaluation
LOOCV and 5-fold cross validation were applied to evaluate the prediction perform-
ance of our method based on known lncRNA-disease associations from the dataset of
Yang [27] and Lnc2Cancer 2.0 database [30]. When LOOCV was applied, each known
lncRNA-disease association was removed from the lncRNA-disease bipartite network
in turn as test sample. Our method was assessed by how well the removed lncRNA-
disease association was ranked within all the lncRNA-disease associations. The receiver
operating characteristics (ROC) curve can be obtained by plotting true positive rate
(TPR) versus false positive rate (FPR) at different rank thresholds. Given the rank
threshold k, TPR indicates the percentage of the removed edges with ranks higher than
the threshold and FPR indicates the percentage of negative samples with ranks higher
than this threshold. Therefore, ROC can be drawn and area under ROC curve (AUC)
could be further calculated (see Additional file 3). Considering the isolated nodes whose
unique edges were removed, we cannot obtain any relevant information about them. So
we removed all the nodes whose degrees were one before we performed LOOCV. The
dataset of Yang contained 236 lncRNA-disease associations between 102 diseases and
44 lncRNAs (see Additional file 4). And 1541 lncRNA-disease associations between 249
lncRNAs and 85 diseases were obtained from the Lnc2Cancer 2.0 database (see Add-
itional file 4).
Our method was compared with the following three state-of-the-art methods (Yang’s
method [27], IRWRLDA [26] and KATZLDA [28]) by cross validation tests on two
datasets (Yang’s dataset and Lnc2Cancer 2.0). In LOOCV tests and 5-fold cross valid-
ation tests, the performance of our method was superior to other three methods. De-
tails for LOOCV tests can be seen in Fig. 1a and b, and the results of 5-fold cross-
validation tests were shown in Fig. 1c and d.
Robustness of our method
To test the robustness of our method in a network view for predicting potential gene-
disease associations, the method of Multiple Survival Screening (MSS) [31] is used to
test our method under perturbation of the bipartite network. First, a total of 2320 po-
tential gene-disease associations in our bipartite network was used to evaluate the per-
formance of our method in these perturbation tests, which is called the set of

verification edges. Then, a certain percentage of edges (10, 20, 30%, respectively) in the
network were deleted randomly in these tests. Our method was utilized to predict po-
tential associations on these remaining networks. The performance is evaluated on the
verification set. At each different threshold, re-sampling experiments are performed
1000 times. A vector of size 2320 was constructed, corresponding to 2320 predicted
edges. Each value in the vector represented the times of its corresponding verification
edge could be predicted in 1000 experiments. Our method was more stable in compari-
son with Yang’s method at different thresholds (Fig. 2). The results of 1000 re-sampling
experiments at different thresholds were shown in Additional file 5. When 20% of edges
were deleted, the prediction accuracy could be maintained at around 0.8 which was sig-
nificantly higher than Yang’s method (p-value = 0.022). As the proportion of deleted
edges increased, the accuracy decreased gradually (Fig. 2). Here, we also randomly
rewired the edges to construct random network, while keeping the degree of each node
in the bipartite network unchanged. Our method was also applied to the random net-
work for comparison. The results indicated that the accuracy of our method was sig-
nificantly higher than that of random network (p-value< 10−10).
Case study
In order to further demonstrate the performance of our method in predicting potential
lncRNA-disease associations, the results of colon cancer and melanoma were analyzed

as case study. For each case, the genes associated with the disease were ranked accord-
ing to their association scores. Based on our results (2320 potential gene-disease associ-
ations), we retained genes within top 5% related to these two diseases independently
for further analysis. Our predictions were validated by other independent experiments,
part of which were listed in Table 1.
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignant tumor of the digestive tract that oc-
curs in the colon. In recent years, the prevalence rate of colorectal cancer has increased
continuously [32]. The studies indicated that lncRNAs played an important role in the
development and progression of colorectal cancer [33]. There were 31 lncRNAs pre-
dicted to have potential associations with colorectal cancer by our method. Part of
them were validated by other independent experiments. For example, Zhou et al. deter-
mined that MIR31HG was closely related to the recurrence of colorectal cancer [34].
The signature of MIR31HG held great potential for risk assessment of recurrence and
personalized management of colorectal cancer patients. Chen et al. observed that miR-
374a inhibited colorectal cancer progression by reducing CCND1 to inactivate the
PI3K/AKT pathway [35]. Cui et al. demonstrated that lncRNA-HEIH promoted CRC
tumorigenesis through counteracting miR-939–mediated transcriptional repression of
Bcl-xL, and suggested that lncRNA-HEIH may serve as a prognostic biomarker and
therapeutic target for CRC [36]. They found that lncRNA-HEIH was significantly in-
creased in colorectal cancer tissues and cell lines. The expression of lncRNA-HEIH was

tients [36]. Moreover, Xu et al. found that the expression level of LSINCT5 was closely
related to the disease-free survival and disease-specific survival rates based on Kaplan-
Meier analysis in CRC patients [37].
Melanoma, also known as malignant melanoma, is a type of malignant tumor derived
from melanocytes. As one of the most malignant tumors in skin tumors, melanoma is
prone to distant metastasis, so early diagnosis and treatment are particularly imperative.
Accumulating evidences have revealed that lncRNAs played critical roles in the devel-
opment and progression of melanoma. There were 32 lncRNAs predicted to have po-
tential associations with melanoma among our results. Some results were validated by
other studies. For example, Montes et al. found that patients with higher levels of
MIR31HG often have reduced p16INK4A expression, which suggested that MIR31HG
with repression of p16INK4A in these patients favored cancer development [38]. Wang
et al. observed that the low expression of U47924.27 was significantly associated with
decreased survival in melanoma patients, revealing the potential role of U47924.27 in
melanoma tumorigenesis and metastasis [39]. Furthermore, Vízkeleti et al. observed
that CCND1 alterations were linked to melanoma progression and CCND1 amplifica-
tion may have a prognostic relevance in cutaneous melanoma and emphasized that
changes in CCND1 gene expression may influence the metastatic progression, survival
and metastasis localization [40].
Discussion
LncRNAs are involved in the regulation of various processes in cells and the develop-
ment of complex diseases through a variety of biological mechanisms. Therefore, pre-
dicting and discovering lncRNAs associated with complex diseases are important for
the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. In this paper, we constructed a bipartite net-
work using known gene-disease associations. Then we predicted potential lncRNA-
disease associations only based on the topological information of the gene-disease bi-
partite network. It is assumed that genes (diseases) associated with the same disease
(gene) are more similar. The assumption was incorporated into our bipartite network
to proposed the definitions of gene clusters and disease clusters. The biological signifi-
cance of the two kinds of clusters are analyzed in comparison with those in random
networks. And then, the problem of predicting potential lncRNA-disease associations
was formulated as a problem of measuring the association strength between gene clus-
ters and disease clusters. The ‘ C _ score ’ index was first defined to estimate the associ-
ation strength between clusters. Then the gene-disease association score was defined
based on the C _ score with regard to the influence of different degrees of the node in
the bipartite network. Cross validation test was applied to evaluate the prediction per-
formance of our method. In comparison with the state-of-the-art prediction methods,
our method can achieve better performance in terms of AUC values and robustness.
Moreover, case studies of melanoma and colon cancer were implemented to further
demonstrate that it could be a useful and simple method for predicting potential rela-
tionships between lncRNAs and diseases as well.
However, there are also some limitations existing in our current method. In spite of
the fact that our method is significantly superior to the previous methods, its perform-
ance can also be improved by incorporating other information in our model. Due to
Yuan et al. BMC Bioinformatics          (2020) 21:180 
Page 7 of 14
the fact that only the known gene-disease associations were exploited in the model, our
method cannot be applied to the diseases without any known associated genes. Further
data integration will be helpful to improve the power of our model and characterize the
complex relationships between new genes (without any known associated diseases) and
new diseases (without any known associated lncRNAs) from different perspectives. For
example, the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) information, disease similarity in-
formation and lncRNA similarity information can be integrated in the network, which
will be our further study. Moreover, the advancement of useful models in other fields
such as miRNA-disease association prediction [41, 42], drug-target interaction predic-
tion [43] and synergistic drug combination prediction [44], would greatly facilitate the
development of lncRNA-disease association prediction.
Conclusion
In this study, we proposed an effective method for predicting potential lncRNA-disease
associations based on a bipartite network. Firstly, the gene-disease bipartite network
was constructed based on known gene-disease associations. Then a formula of gene-
disease association score was proposed to evaluate the strength of the potential associa-
tions between diseases and lncRNAs. Our method was estimated comprehensively by
cross-validation, robustness analysis and case studies in comparison with other
methods. The results showed that our method had higher prediction accuracy and ro-
bustness even if it was simple and easy.
Methods
Data sources
The dataset of known gene-disease associations used in this article were from the work
of Yang [27], including lncRNA-disease associations and protein-coding gene-disease
associations. The lncRNA-disease associations contained two parts. One was from the
LncRNADisease [19] database included 480 experimentally confirmed associations be-
tween 118 lncRNAs and 166 diseases. The other part was from literature mining in-
cluded 380 lncRNA-disease associations between 226 lncRNAs and 145 diseases. There
were 578 associations between 295 lncRNAs and 214 diseases totally. Besides, protein-
coding gene-disease associations from Yang’s study [27] were also incorporated into
the current study. Finally, a total of 1558 gene-disease associations between 1096 genes
(295 lncRNAs and 801 protein-coding genes) and 214 diseases were merged together
to construct the gene-disease bipartite network (see Additional file 6).
Based on the known associations between lncRNAs and diseases, we constructed
a bipartite network defined as G(X, Y, L). The X denoted a set of lncRNA nodes.
The Y denoted a set of disease nodes in which the nodes were associated with the
lncRNAs in X. L represented a set of edges between the nodes in X and the nodes
in Y. Regarding to the associations between protein-coding genes and diseases
which can provide more informative clues, these associations were further inte-
grated into the bipartite network. Thus, the X was a family of protein-coding genes
and lncRNAs. Ultimately, a bipartite network based on known protein-coding
gene/lncRNA disease associations was constructed for the prediction of potential
gene-disease associations.

Disease cluster and gene cluster
It is assumed that diseases (genes) associated with the mutual genes (diseases) are more
similar [45] which was exploited to predict novel gene-disease associations in our work.
Therefore, as is for the gene-disease bipartite network G(X, Y, L), we defined the notion
of disease cluster and gene cluster based on this assumption. For any given disease, we
called the collection of its associated genes in the bipartite network as a gene cluster.
Similarly, for any given gene, we called the collection of its associated diseases in the bi-
partite network as a disease cluster. As shown in Fig. 3, the gene cluster of disease d
was denoted by gCluster(d) indicated by a green dashed line. The disease cluster of
gene g was denoted by dCluster(g) indicated by a red dashed line. Moreover, for any
node v in the network we built, the N(v) described a set of nodes linked to v. Obviously,
we had N(d) = gCluster(d) and N(g) = dCluster(g).
The node similarity in the same cluster was calculated to explore the biological sig-
nificance of these two kinds of clusters in the bipartite network to facilitate the applica-
tion of the clusters. For this purpose, we examine the node similarity of these two
kinds of clusters first in our bipartite network as follows. For any given gene g in the bi-
partite network, the similarity of corresponding dCluster(g) was calculated by the aver-
age similarity between any two diseases in the cluster. Analogously, the similarity of
gCluster(d) for disease d was computed through the average functional similarities of
any two genes in the cluster. Next, we constructed different random clusters which had
the same size as the corresponding gene/disease clusters. The similarities of random
clusters were calculated in the same way (see Additional files 3, 7 and 8). The result of
Fig. 3 Disease cluster and gene cluster in bipartite network: The circle represented disease node, the
hexagon represented gene node, the disease cluster dCluster(g) of gene g was identified by a red dotted
line, the gene cluster gCluster(d) of disease d was identified by a green dotted line, and the blue line
represented edge between gCluster(d) and dCluster(g)

comparative functional similarities of random gene clusters with that of real gene clus-
ters was represented in Fig. 4a. The result of comparative similarities of random disease
clusters with that of real disease clusters was represented in Fig. 4b. As expected, the
node similarities of real disease clusters were significantly higher than those of random
disease clusters in the bipartite network (p-value = 0.0004). It can be seen that the com-
parison of real gene clusters with random gene clusters had comparable results (p-
value = 0.0003). These results indicated that disease clusters and gene clusters really
existed in our bipartite network and may have some biological significance. It is reason-
able to infer that the existence of such clusters was due to the fact that nodes in the
identical cluster were connected to at least one mutual node in the network. Addition-
ally, the shortest topological distance between any two nodes in a disease cluster or a
gene cluster was two, which was the minimum distance between nodes from the same
side in a bipartite network. Consequently, for a potential gene-disease pair (g, d) whose
relationship was remain unknown in the bipartite network, we explored the similarity
of the disease cluster dCluster(g) and the functional similarity of the gene cluster gClus-
ter(d) to calculate the association strength of a potential gene-disease pair (g, d).
Calculation of cluster association score
Given a pair of gene-disease association (g, d), g and d represented a gene and a disease
in the bipartite network, respectively. The cluster association score of the gene cluster
corresponding to d and the disease cluster corresponding to g can be mathematically
defined as follows:
C score g; d
ð
Þ ¼ LðdCluster g
ð Þ; gCluster d
ð ÞÞ
j
j
ð1Þ
Where dCluster(g) and gCluster(d) were disease cluster of gene g and gene cluster of
disease d, respectively. L(dCluster(g), gCluster(d)) was the edges set in which the elem-
ent represented the edge between nodes in dCluster(g) and that in gCluster(d). In
addition, |•| denoted the size of the edges set. The eq. (1) described the cluster associ-
ation score of a gene-disease pair (g, d) is used to characterize how heavily the gene
cluster was associated with the disease cluster. It was determined by the number of
Fig. 4 Cluster similarities in the bipartite network. a Comparison of functional similarities between real gene
clusters and random gene clusters. b Comparison of similarities between real disease clusters and random

edges between the two clusters. For example, the value of C _ score(g, d) in Fig. 3 was 7,
because there were 7 connected edges between dCluster(g) and gCluster(d) which were
drawn by blue lines.
To better verify the performance of C _ score in measuring the correlations between
genes and diseases, we calculated C _ score values of any gene-disease pairs as long as
there was at least one edge between them in the bipartite network. Furthermore, ac-
cording to the gene cluster and the disease cluster of each edge, we constructed ran-
dom gene cluster and random disease cluster with the same size, respectively. Then we
calculated C _ score value based on the random gene cluster and the random disease
cluster for comparison (see Additional files 3,9). It was interesting that the results indi-
cated that the C _ score values of real clusters corresponding to the known edges were
much greater than that derived from random clusters (Additional file 1, Fig. S1). It can
be expected that the C _ score can provide informative insights into the uncovering the
potential disease-gene associations. As a result, the gene-disease association score was
defined based on the C _ score in the following section.
Calculation of gene-disease association score
While there was no known edge between gene g and disease d in the bipartite network,
we can calculate the gene-disease association score based on the aforementioned for-
mula of C _ score (cluster association score) for gene-disease pair (g, d). Notably, the
value of C _ score was determined only by the number of connections between two
clusters corresponding to the disease and the gene. It was influenced by the degrees of
gene g and disease d in three different types of cases, which was exampled in Fig. 5. It
was reasonable to expect that these three distinct types between two clusters may ap-
pear in the network, and all of them had a C _ score value of 1. However, the associ-
ation strength of the gene g and the disease d in the three conditions were obviously
different. Apparently, the disease cluster corresponding to gene g and the gene cluster
corresponding to disease d in Fig. 5a had the strongest association among three cases.
Since the nodes in Fig. 5b and Fig. 5c had higher degrees, their values of C _ score were
equivalent to that in Fig. 5a. It was obvious that the cluster association score was a

favorable method for nodes with large degrees. Therefore, considering the influence of
nodes degree in the bipartite network, the association score between gene g and disease
d was defined based on the C _ score and the node degree as follows.

Here, N(g) and N(d) represented the degrees of gene g and disease d in the bipartite
network, respectively. C _ score(g, d) was the cluster association score which can be cal-
culated by the formula (1). The value of DG _ score(g, d) reflected the association
strength of gene-disease pairs with no known edges in the bipartite network.
