Abstract: Metal-only Lewis pairs (MOLPs) in which the two
metal fragments are solely connected by a dative M!M
bond represent privileged architectures to acquire funda-
mental understanding of bimetallic bonding. This has impor-
tant implications in many catalytic processes or supramolec-
ular systems that rely on synergistic effects between two
metals. However, a systematic experimental/computational
approach on a well-defined class of compounds is lacking.
Here we report a family of MOLPs constructed around the
RhI precursor [(h5-C5Me5)Rh(PMe3)2] (1) with a series of s, p
and d-block metals, mostly from the main group elements,
and investigate their bonding by computational means.
Among the new MOLPs, we have structurally characterized
those formed by dative bonding between 1 and MgMeBr,
AlMe3, GeCl2, SnCl2, ZnMe2 and Zn(C6F5)2, as well as spectro-
scopically identified the ones resulting from coordination to
MBArF (M=Na, Li; BArF
@=[B(C6H2-3,5-(CF3)2)4]@) and CuCl.
Some of these compounds represent unique examples of bi-
metallic structures, such as the first unambiguous cases of
Rh!Mg dative bonding or base-free rhodium bound germy-
lene and stannylene species. Multinuclear NMR spectroscopy,
including 103Rh NMR, is used to probe the formation of Rh!
M bonds. A comprehensive theoretical analysis of those pro-
vides clear trends. As anticipated, greater bond covalency is
found for the more electronegative acids, whereas ionic
character dominates for the least electronegative nuclei,
though some degree of electron sharing is identified in all
cases.
Introduction
The unambiguous recognition of M@M bonding within the de-
termination of the Mn2(CO)10 structure[1] was a landmark dis-
covery in transition metal chemistry and set the grounds for
exciting developments in the field of polynuclear molecular
compounds.[2] Only a few years later, the existence of multiple
bonding between metals was demonstrated by Cotton and co-
workers in [Re2Cl8],[2–3] shattering at the same time the
common belief of a maximum bond order of three, as seen in
the p-block. The area of metal-to-metal bonded compounds
has discontinuously evolved since then, in a path teemed with
milestones that include, to cite some paradigmatic examples,
the first quintuple-bonded dimetallic structure [Cr2{C6H3-2,6-
Dip2}2][4]
(Dip=C6H3-2,6-iPr2)
or
the
MI
dimers
[Zn2Cp*2][5]
(Cp*=[h5-C5Me5]@)
and
[Mg2(DipNacnac)2][6]
(DipNacnac=
[(DipNCMe2)2CH]@) with a MI@MI bond.
A fascinating class of metal–metal bonded complexes that is
receiving growing attention are those with M!M dative
bonds, also referred as metal-only Lewis pairs (MOLPs).[7] Al-
though noticed earlier,[8] the first authoritative report on such a
species dates back to 1967, when Nowell and Russell elucidat-
ed the solid-state structure of [(h5-C5H5)(CO)2Co!HgCl2].[9] Nu-
merous studies based on a wide variety of transition metals
were later disclosed, particularly during the last decade.[10]
Apart from the fundamental appeal of these species, the inter-
est on their study is at the heart of transition metal reactivity.
The basicity of a transition metal site is important for small
molecule coordination (e.g. borane binding in borylation pro-
cesses),[11] as well as during oxidative addition reactions. In
turn, the latter are elementary steps present in most catalytic
cycles, as noticed from early reports.[12] Thus, a better under-
standing of transition metal basicity (i.e. through the examina-
tion of metal-only Lewis pairs)[13] may provide important infor-
mation to be assimilated by bond activation and catalysis re-
search.
In addition, bimetallic dative bonding has implications in
many catalytic processes that involve the participation of two
metal fragments of contrasting electronic nature. For instance,
a series of studies on Pd-catalyzed Negishi and Sonogashira

cross-coupling reactions revealed the impact on catalytic per-
formance of bimetallic Lewis acid-base interactions between
an electron rich PdII center and acidic ZnII or CuI fragments.[14]
Unsupported MOLP compounds have also proved competent
in the activation of a variety of E@H bonds (E=H, X, N, O) in
which their individual monometallic constituents revealed
themselves inactive.[15] The incorporation of acidic metals or
metalloids as s-acceptors Z-type ligands in MOLP-type struc-
tures permits structural and electronic modulation of the basic
metal site,[16] whereas the strength of the M!M dative bond-
ing in thermally induced[17] metal-only frustrated Lewis pairs
deeply impacts the reactivity and catalytic performance of the
latter systems.[18] In addition, metal-to-metal dative bonding
has important implications in supramolecular and molecular
engineering,[19] as well as in host–guest chemistry.[20]
With all this in mind, it becomes obvious that a deep under-
standing of the nature of metal-to-metal bond in these molec-
ular compounds and supramolecular aggregations will have an
important impact in a range of areas. In fact, this has been a
matter of intense debate, which is not surprising considering
the set of bonding components that may be involved (i.e.
ionic, covalent, dative, dispersion…). As such, unsupported sys-
tems in which the bond between the two metals is the sole
force holding the two fragments together constitute ideal
motifs to study, since other factors that may obscure bonding
analysis are excluded. In their original report, Nowell and Rus-
sell postulated that [(h5-C5H5)(CO)2Co!HgCl2] could be consid-
ered a metallic Lewis acid–base adduct,[9] as lately proposed
for many other systems,[18a,21] including those based on d8-d10
interactions (referred to the last filled subshell of the bonding
metals).[22] An alternative description proposed by Pyykkç im-
plies dispersion forces as the main component of the bimetal-
lic bonding.[23] However, more recent computational work
speaks in favor of the former assumption, revealing that dis-
persion forces contribute to a lesser extent in these type of
systems compared to the role of electrostatic and orbital inter-
actions.[24]
Most studies have either focused on the synthesis and struc-
tural characterization of a group of several MOLPs or on the
computational analysis of previously reported bimetallic archi-
tectures of this kind. However, a more comprehensive and
combined experimental/computational approach on a family
of unsupported MOLPs is lacking. With this aim, we have se-
lected the electron rich RhI compound [(h5-C5Me5)Rh(PMe3)2][25]
(1) as a Lewis base to investigate a variety of MOLPs generated
by its combination with well-known metallic and metalloid
Lewis acids (Figure 1). We provide not only the spectroscopic
(including 103Rh NMR) and structural characterization of these
uncommon compounds, but also a computational analysis of
their RhI!M bonding.
Results and Discussion
The precise choice of 1 as the Lewis base to design MOLPs
was made on the basis of several features: (i) the basic
behavior of 1 has already been well established;[25] (ii) PMe3 li-
gands enhance the nucleophilicity[13a] of the RhI site compared
to
its
more
widely
explored
carbonyl
analogue
[(h5-
C5Me5)Rh(CO)2];[26] (iii) the robustness of (h5-C5Me5) ligand pre-
vents undesired reactivity recorded for its unsubstituted (h5-
C5H5) analogue;[27] (iv) as a neutral Lewis base, its combination
with neutral acids will minimize the ionic and electrostatic
components of the RhI!M bond; (v) as a pentacoordinated
18-electron species, insertion reactions into polar bonds of the
Lewis acid, or the formation of intermediate alkyl or hydride
bridging species[28] that would cloud analysis of the RhI!M
bond, will be less favored; and (vi) 103Rh is NMR active (I=1/2,
100% abundant). With all this in mind, we have combined 1
with a variety of main group metal precursors as Lewis acids.
With the exception of CuCl, we avoided the extensive use of
transition metal electrophiles to circumvent more complex
bonding pictures on grounds of their available d orbitals.
Synthesis of RhI MOLPs with s-Block Acids
The number of compounds exhibiting metalophilic interactions
between transition and alkali metals is abundant.[29] Systems
that show identical or even reduced M@M bond lengths com-
pared to the sum of their corresponding covalent atomic
radii[30] presumably present some degree of bond covalency.
Although this is relatively common in the case of lithium,[31] ex-
amples of its heavier congener sodium are less profuse.[32] Con-
sidering rhodium, the weak interaction of square planar
[RhCl4]3@ with a naked Na+ cation has been analyzed by com-
putational means as the result of orbital overlapping.[22a] The
solid-state structure of [Na(thf)3][Rh(h4-cod)Rh(P3Mes3)] reveals

a short Rh@Na bond length of 3.105(2) a,[33] only slightly elon-
gated
with
respect
to
the
sum
of
their
covalent
radii
(3.08 a).[30] As anticipated, support for covalent bonding was
inferred from theoretical studies. It is important to remark that
this type of Lewis acid–base interaction with alkali metals may
promote interconversion between structural conformations in
transition metal complexes,[34] in turn a powerful tool for de-
signing molecular machines.[35]
We decided to explore the possibility of accessing unsup-
ported MOLPs containing lithium and sodium cations. To pre-
vent artificial elongation of the Rh!M bond due to steric re-
pulsion,[32b] we focused on lithium and sodium salts of the
low-coordinating
tetrakis(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)borate
anion (BArF
@), while using non-coordinating solvents. Addition
of either one equivalent of NaBArf or LiBArf to bromobenzene
solutions of 1 result in immediate color darkening. Complete
consumption of 1 is evinced by a pronounced decrease in the
1JPRh coupling constant of around 80 Hz ([A·Li]: 130 Hz; [A·Na]:
138 Hz; c.f. 1: 1JPRh=216 Hz), a distinctive feature that applies
to all MOLPs prepared herein (see Table 2 below). Another
common observation is the shift towards slightly lower fre-
quencies of the 1H NMR signal associated to the pentamethyl-
cyclopentadienyl ring, which resonates at 2.16 ppm for com-
pound 1 (c.f. [A·Li] : d=1.61 ppm; [A·Na]: d=1.67 ppm). We
hypothesize compounds [A·Li] and [A·Na] to be the targeted
alkali MOLPs (Scheme 1a), whose existence is further support-
ed by computational means (vide infra), though weak h5-coor-
dination to the empty face of the Cp* ligand cannot be ruled
out. At this stage, we defer a definitive proposal due to the
lack of structural data. All our attempts to grow single crystals
of these species were unsuccessful. We recovered in all cases
either crystalline M[BArF] (M=Li, Na), which may illustrate the
weakness of the Rh!Li/Na interaction, or observed the forma-
tion of the corresponding RhIII hydride [(h5-C5Me5)Rh(PMe3)2H]
[BArF][24] (2), the latter formed due to the presence of adventi-
tious water. Analogous cooperative reactivity has been report-
ed for other MOLPs based on [Pt(PtBu3)2].[14a,b] For further vali-
dation, compound 2 could be independently synthesized by
addition of equimolar amounts of ammonium salts to 1 and it
has been utilized as a benchmark species to investigate the
bonding.
As noted earlier we aimed to access MOLPs by combining
neutral fragments, aside from the prior Li+ and Na+ excep-
tions, to reduce the electrostatic component of the metal-to-
metal bond. Reaction of 1 with two equivalents of the
Grignard reagent MgMeBr readily yielded a new species 3
(Scheme 1b) characterized by a sharp decrease of the
1JPRh
coupling constant to 172 Hz, along with shifts of the 31P{1H}
(d=@10.2 ppm)
and
pentamethylcyclopentadienyl
1H
(d=
1.87 ppm) NMR signals towards lower frequencies. Despite the
high instability of 3, single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction
studies were grown from diluted benzene solutions and
revealed
the
dimeric
structure
[(h5-C5Me5)(PMe3)2Rh!
Mg(MexBr1@x)(m-Br)]2 (Figure 2) in which the methyl group
bound to magnesium is mostly exchanged by a bromide nu-
cleus[36] (Me:Br with 15:85 occupancies). Using an equimolar
amount of the Grignard reagent did not provide full conver-
sion of 1, whereas the addition of MgBr2 or MgMe2 to access a
MOLP without substitutional disorder proved unsuccessful,
partly due to solubility issues.
As expected, MOLP 3 adopts a piano-stool conformation
after coordination of the Lewis acid. The Rh@Mg bond length
accounts for 2.651(3) a, shortened by ca. 0.2 a with respect to
the sum of the covalent radii (2.83 a),[30] thus indicative of
bond covalency (vide infra). Two other parameters, namely
drel
[7] (0.94) and fsr (formal shortness ratio)[37] (1.01) (Table 1),
defined as the ratio between the M@M bond distance and the
sum of either the covalent radii or the metallic radii, respec-
tively, underpin this assumption. The most relevant geometric
parameters for the X-ray diffraction structures reported in this
work are depicted in Table 1. It is worth of note that this exotic
structure is the first unambiguous example of an unsupported
Rh@Mg bond, since the only prior related example contains a
metal hydride that exhibits some degree of bridging charac-
ter.[38] Moreover, despite the extensive use of Grignard reagents
in organometallic chemistry, it is surprising that compound 3
seems to be the only Mg-based MOLP comprised of neutral
fragments.[39]
As stated above, the choice of rhodium as the Lewis base
was in part made attending to its NMR activity (Table 2). To ob-
serve chemical shifts associated to 103Rh centers we employed
a cross polarization approach by means of HMQC experiments

block metal precursors (a) M[BArF] (M=Li, Na) and (b) MgMeBr. Rapid forma-
tion of hydride 2 in wet solvents in all MOLPs reported herein was ascer-
tained by the appearance of a low-frequency 1H NMR signal recorded at
@13.35 ppm (2JHP=23, 1JHRh=35 Hz).

through its coupling to 31P nuclei (see Experimental Section for
details). Considering its low sensitivity and rather wide chemi-
cal shift range (ca. 12000 ppm),[40] this strategy enormously fa-
cilitates the acquisition of 103Rh NMR data. The new MOLPs are
characterized by 103Rh{1H} NMR resonances shifted to lower fre-
quencies compared to precursor 1 (@9165 ppm), with 3 exhib-
iting a signal at @9404 ppm and the products derived from
the addition of alkali metals resonating at around @9262 ppm
(Figure 3).
Synthesis of RhI MOLPs with p-Block Acids
Moving to the p-block we examined the reactivity of 1 with
widely used metalloid precursors of the group 13 and 14,
more precisely GeCl2·dioxane, SnCl2, GaCl3, AlCl3 and AlMe3.
Whereas tricoordinated group 14 species has been widely ex-
ploited as Lewis acids, heavier tetrylenes (i.e. :GeCl2, :SnCl2) ex-
hibit ambiphilic behavior due to the joint presence of a lone
electron pair and an empty p orbital. We thought of interest to
access both types of MOLPs to later provide a comparison of
the bonding scheme between each other. Reaction of 1 with
either GaCl3 or AlCl3 resulted in the precipitation of a highly in-
soluble material or the formation of intractable mixtures, re-
spectively. The latter is not surprising considering previously
reported difficulties to access Rh–alane MOLPs by direct com-
bination of the two metal fragments.[41] However, addition of
one equivalent of AlMe3 (toluene solution, 1m) to a benzene

solution of 1 resulted in clean formation of the corresponding
1·AlMe3 MOLP. The same occurs by adding GeCl2·dioxane or
SnCl2 to bromobenzene solutions of the rhodium precursor to
yield 1·GeCl2 and 1·SnCl2, respectively, though the former re-
quired three hours for completion while the tin MOLP formed
immediately. In the case of germanium, two equivalents of
GeCl2·dioxane were required to achieve full consumption of 1,
presumably because the second germanium may facilitate di-
oxane
withdrawal
from
the
coordinating
GeCl2
terminus
(Scheme 2).
Multinuclear NMR spectroscopic analysis illustrates the for-
mation of the new MOLPs exhibiting the same distinctive fea-
tures commented above (Table 2), that is, a marked decrease
of the 1JPRh coupling constant of ca. 40 Hz and a displacement
to lower frequencies of the 1H NMR signal due to the pentame-
thylcyclopentadienyl ring. For the tin analogue we could also
detect a broad
119Sn{1H} NMR signal at 810.7 ppm, whereas
1·AlMe3 provides a distinctive 1H NMR singlet at @0.1 ppm due
to the Al-bound methyl termini, with a corresponding 13C{1H}
NMR signal at 1.0 ppm. Interestingly, 103Rh{1H} NMR resonances
due to the tetrylene MOLPs appear upshifted by ca. 400 ppm
(d=@8756, 1·GeCl2; @8836 ppm, 1·SnCl2) compared to 1 (d=
@9165 ppm), contrasting with all other main-group based
MOLPs reported herein (Table 2).
Single-crystals of compounds 1·GeCl2, 1·SnCl2 and 1·AlMe3
amenable to X-ray diffraction studies where grown by slow dif-
fusion of pentane into their benzene or bromobenzene solu-
tions, once more revealing the piano stool configuration
around the rhodium center after coordination to the Lewis
acids (Figure 2, Table 1). The unsupported M@M bond lengths
for 1·GeCl2 (2.501(1) a) and 1·SnCl2 (2.687(3) a) are slightly
shorter than the sum of covalent radii (rRh+Ge=2.62; rRh+Sn=
2.81 a),[30] whereas that of 1·AlMe3 (2.635(4) a) is identical to
the expected theoretical value for a covalent interaction
(2.63 a).[30] The asymmetric unit of structure 1·GeCl2 contains
four independent molecules of the MOLP, being the aforemen-
tioned Rh-Ge bond length the average for all of them. The
solid-state structures of 1·GeCl2 and 1·SnCl2 unveil a strong
pyramidalization of the tetrel moiety, as seen in other related
systems based on platinum.[42] However, this is not the case in
other metallic complexes with bound tetrels and a planar dis-
position around the group 14 element.[43] It has been noticed
that pyramidalization requires both coordination to strongly
Lewis basic metals and a non-directional lone pair,[42d] features
fulfilled for 1·ECl2 (E=Ge, Sn). Since the lone pair on stanny-
lene dichloride has more pronounced s-character than that in
its germylene analogue, the directionality of the former is de-
creased and as such a higher pyramidalization is anticipated
for 1·SnCl2. In fact, the pyramidalization angle estimated by
the POAV method of Haddon[44] for 1·SnCl2 (26.2) surpass that
of 1·GeCl2 (24.4).
To the best of our knowledge, compounds 1·GeCl2 and
1·SnCl2 represent the first examples of rhodium-bound germy-
lene and stannylene non-stabilized by the coordination of a
base. All prior structures containing Rh@E(II) (E=Ge, Sn) bonds
involve tetrel centers bearing an additional intra- or intermo-
lecular Lewis donor.[45] As such, those escape the definition of
MOLP investigated in this work, since base-stabilized tetrylenes
do not behave as acidic fragment any more, but as s-donating
ligands. For its part, earlier reports describe base-free rhodium
adducts of SnCl2, but their dimeric nature preclude a clear un-
derstanding of the bonding situation.[46] As introduced earlier,
the preparation of a Rh-alane adduct by direct combination of
the two metal fragments, as reported herein, had so far been
unsuccessful. The first crystallographycally characterized Rh–
alane adduct was reported by Braunschweig relying on the
transmetalation of the alane from [(PCy3)2Pt!AlCl3] to [(h5-
C5H5)Rh(PMe3)2].[47,48] The Rh@Al bond length in 1·AlMe3 is con-
siderably elongated by around 0.2 a relative to the two previ-
ously reported Rh–alane adducts based on AlCl3,[41,47] as ex-
pected for the less acidic AlMe3. This diminished acidity may
explain the absence of previous unsupported transition metal
MOLPs containing trimethylaluminum, being 1·AlMe3 the first
of its kind.[49] Once more, this is an unexpected finding consid-
ering the extensive use of AlMe3 as a methylating agent or in
transition metal catalyzed polymerization.
Synthesis of RhI MOLPs with d-Block Acids
Turning into the d-block and keeping our aim to prepare RhI
MOLPS with neutral main group metal Lewis acids we decided
to check the reactivity of 1 with two common zinc precursors,
more precisely ZnMe2 and Zn(C6F5)2. For the sake of complete-
ness, we also examined the formation of metal adducts with
simple forms of copper and silver. Complexes 1·ZnMe2 and
1·Zn(C6F5)2 were immediately formed after addition of one
equivalent of the organometallic zinc substrate over a benzene
solution of 1 (Scheme 3). These complexes exhibit sharp 31P{1H}
NMR signals at d=@6.9 (1JPRh=192 Hz) and @7.2 ppm (1JPRh=
167 Hz), respectively. The noticeable decrease of the 1JPRh cou-
pling constants relative to 1 evidences formation of Rh!Zn
MOLPs.

in the corresponding 31P{1H} NMR spectra. In contrast, addition
of one equivalent of CuCl over a bromobenzene solution of 1
cleanly provided a new species (1·CuCl) characterized by a
31P{1H} NMR doublet at @3.0 ppm (1JPRh=144 Hz), once again
suggesting the formation of a dative bond between the two
metals (Scheme 3). The corresponding
103Rh{1H} signal reso-
nates at @8540 ppm, shifted to higher frequencies compared
to 1. This contrasts with all other MOLPs described herein
except those containing ambiphilic tetrylenes, which speaks in
favor of some differences in the bonding situation between
the MOLPs involving purely acidic fragments and those where
some degree of back-donation may be anticipated (i.e. those
based on Ge, Sn and Cu).
Crystals of 1·ZnMe2 and 1·Zn(C6F5)2 where grown by slow
diffusion of pentane into their benzene solutions. The larger
acidity of the fluorinated zinc moiety is reflected in a shorter
Rh-Zn bond length of 2.484(1) a in 1·Zn(C6F5)2 compared to
that in 1·ZnMe2 (dRhZn=2.618(1) a), attesting as well that steric
effects may be less relevant (Figure 2). Nonetheless, both Rh@
Zn distances account for less than the sum of the correspond-
ing covalent radii (2.64 a),[30] suggesting a strong metal–metal
interaction. These two complexes constitute the first unsup-
ported MOLPs exhibiting a dative Rh!Zn bond and construct-
ed around neutral fragments.[38,50] Structures alike these are
presumably relevant intermediates during RhI-catalyzed Ne-
gishi coupling reactions.[50e,51] Mechanistic studies have permit-
ted to isolate a Rh/Zn complex derived from insertion of the
rhodium center into one of the Zn@C bonds in diphenyl-
zinc,[51b] whose likely precursor consist in a Lewis adduct akin
to 1·ZnMe2 or 1·Zn(C6F5)2. Related to this, formation of a
[RhI]!ZnCl2 MOLP was postulated as a deactivation product
during catalysis, although their molecular formulation could
not be elucidated.
Regarding the copper adduct, attempts to grow single crys-
tals of 1·CuCl were unfruitful, partly because of the low solubil-
ity of the adduct which caused rapid precipitation in most
cases. This fact, along with non-definitive diffusion spectro-
scopic studies, prevented us to obtain a clear picture of its
molecular structure. In principle, both a monomeric or dimeric
nature could be proposed. To discern between these two
possibilities, we made use of DFT calculations. However, at-
tempts
to

a
dimeric
species
of
type
[(h5-
C5Me5)Rh(PMe3)2Cu(m-Cl)]2 resulted in cleavage of the chloride
bridges, supporting an unbridged formulation for 1·CuCl. It is
interesting to note that this species represents a rare case of
Rh!Cu MOLP, with prior complexes bearing a Rh@Cu bond
typically relying on the stability conferred by bridging li-
gands,[52] the use of cationic copper fragments[53] or the coordi-
nation of the neutral copper halide as a bridging motif.[54]
Computational analysis of Rh!M bonding in RhI MOLPs
Insight into the nature of the Rh!M interactions in the RhI@M
adducts has been obtained from DFT calculations, analysis of
the calculated electron densities of the adducts within the
Atoms In Molecules theory (AIM)[55] and Natural Bonding Orbi-
tals (NBO) analysis.[56,57,58] Optimized geometries of the adducts
in bulk solvent were obtained by DFT methods (SMD-wB97XD/
6-31 g(d,p)/SDD level)[59,60,61,62,63,64] with the Gaussian09 soft-
ware.[65] Although it can be argued that DFT-optimized geome-
tries with a solvent model may not represent appropriately the
solid state structures, it must be highlighted that our model is
in good agreement with the X-ray diffraction geometries avail-
able (RMSD for all geometries is 0.58 a) and particularly that
the calculated Rh@M distances remain equal or below the sum
of the covalent radii of the two atoms.[7,29] Optimized geome-
tries for the Na, Li and Cu adducts were also calculated in halo-
genated benzene. In the case of the Li and Na species, the
BArF
@ anion was excluded from the calculations to yield Rh@M
distances of 2.46 and 2.76 a respectively. When the BArF
@ was
introduced in the Na system, the Rh@Na distance increased
only slightly to 2.77 a, still shorter than the sum of the cova-
lent radii of Rh and Na. The CuCl adduct was considered as a
monomeric species and the calculations afforded a Rh@M dis-
tance of 2.37 a (8cov radii=2.74 a).
Topological analysis of the electron density was carried out
with the AIM methods and the Multiwfn software[66,67] from
wavefunctions
calculated
at
the
SMD-wB97XD/6-311+ +
g(2d,p)/Sapporo-TZP level[68,69,70,71,72] with the previously opti-
mized geometries. This study located bond critical points
(BCPs) in the electron density and unique bond paths connect-
ing the Rh and M atoms for all adducts (Figure 4 and SC1).
The existence of BCP and bond paths between two atoms
has been interpreted as the necessary condition for them to
form a chemical bond and several indicators based on the
electron density have been used in the literature to character-
ize interatomic interactions.[55,73] Namely, the Laplacian of the
electron density at the BCP, r21b, and the total energy density,
Hb, as the sum of the electronic potential and kinetic energy
densities, Gb and Vb. Thus, for open-shell interactions (pure co-
valent bonds) r21b<0 (the electron density is locally concen-
trated) and for closed-shell interactions r21b >0 (the electron
density is locally depleted). Closed-shell interactions are also
characterized by electron densities at the BCPs, 1b, of the order
of 0.01 a.u., at least one order of magnitude smaller than in
open-shell interactions. Moreover, it has been argued that the
sufficient condition for a bond to be considered covalent is
Hb<0, independently of the sign of the Laplacian.[74,75] A class
of intermediate or partially covalent bonds[76] have thus been

characterized as having 2> jVbj/Gb>1. Shared (metal–metal)
and donor–acceptor (metal–ligand) interactions fall within this
class.[77]
As shown in Table 3 (and Table S3 in the Supporting Infor-
mation), the values of 1b for our Rh@M interactions are small,
ranging from 0.020 a.u. for 1·Na to 0.072 a.u. for 1·GeCl2. This,
in addition to positive values for r21b, is in agreement with
closed-shell interactions between the Rh and M atoms.[55] For
the sake of comparison, Rh@P BCPs’ have 1b values close to 0.1
a.u and r21b >0. Also, 1b at the Rh@H bond of the RhIII hydride
2 has a value of 0.150 a.u. and r21b >0. Arguably,[24a] the mag-
nitude of 1b and Hb can be used to assess the strength of an
interaction.[79] In this case, 1b follows the order Na+ <Li+ <
MgBr2<ZnMe2&AlMe3<Zn(C6F5)2&SnCl2<CuCl&GeCl2 !H,
and it correlates with Hb,[80] which interestingly, is negative
for all species except for that with the smallest 1b, 1·Na
(Figure 5).
These results suggest that the least electronegative atoms
(Li, Na, and Mg), with the smallest 1b and Hb close to zero,
form predominantly ionic interactions with Rh (although with
some degree of electron sharing as it shall be discussed
below), whereas the covalent character becomes more promi-
nent as the electronegativity of the element bound to Rh in-
creases and their electronegativity difference decreases (Dcp=
cP (M or H)–cP (Rh)). Indeed, reasonable correlations have been
found between Dcp and 1b or Hb as shown in Figure 5 for 1b
(and Figure S4 for Hb). These correlations highlight a general
trend, but they obviously fail to account for the complexity of
the interactions. For example, they do not reflect the different
acidity of the two Zn fragments and do not include the Rh@H
bond of 2, since its associated Hb relative to those of the Rh@M
bonds is higher than the corresponding electronegativity dif-
ference.
Another parameter that has been considered in this study is
the delocalization index between the Rh and M, or H atoms,
d(Rh,M), which accounts for the extent of electron sharing be-
tween the atomic basins[81,82] and can be considered an AIM
equivalent to orbital-based bond orders. For a covalent bond,

such as the H@H or C@H bonds, d(C,H) is close to 1, whereas
purely ionic interactions have delocalization indices close to
zero. Table 3 shows d(Rh,M) values stretching from less than
0.022 electrons for the adducts with s-block metals to close to
0.8 electrons for the adducts with the two tetrylenes, attesting
the higher covalent character of the latter interactions. The
value calculated for the Rh@H bond of 2, a covalent bond, is
0.91 electrons. Thus, the same trends as those emerging from
1b and Hb are observed for d(Rh,M) including a linear depend-
ence with Dcp (Figure S4).
When the Laplacian of the electron density is considered, all
adducts yield positive values at the Rh@M (and Rh@H) BCPs,
which is indicative of close-shell interactions. In this case, no
correlations arose between the Laplacian and other magni-
tudes derived from the electron density. Some correlations be-
tween the Laplacian and the electron density or the electrone-
gativity difference have been found in coordination com-
pounds[79] and their absence in this case may reflect the differ-
ent nature of the various Rh@M interactions of this work, as
shall be discussed below from an orbital perspective. Never-
theless, we can classify these interactions in at least two
groups according to jVbj/Gb values (vide supra). One includes
the adducts with s-block metals, which have jVbj/Gb values
close to 1 (Hb&0), characteristic of interactions with very low
covalent character (for 1·Na jVbj/Gb =0.98 a.u.), and a second
group contains the remaining adducts with p- and d-block
metal, with jVbj/Gb values that range from 1.30 a.u. for
1·ZnMe2 to 1.83 a.u. for 1·GeCl2, typical of more covalent, in-
termediate interactions. For the sake of comparison Rh
!
P
bonds in these systems, classical donor–acceptor interactions,
have associated jVbj/Gb values of about 1.5–1.6 a.u. The higher
values for jVbj/Gb have been found for the three p-block
metals, with the value for the Rh@Ge interaction approaching
the jVbj/Gb +2 (r21b,0) limit for shared-shell (pure covalent)
interactions. The jVbj/Gb and r21b values for the Rh@H bond
of 2 are 1.975 and 0.010 a.u. respectively.
Natural bonding orbital (NBO) analysis was performed at the
DFT SMD-wB97XD/6–311 g(2d,p)/def2-TZVP(ECP) level.[83,84] The
NBO method creates a pattern of localized bonds and lone
pairs that is a Lewis-type description for the molecule. These
natural bonding orbitals may not achieve double occupancy,
and the departures from the “electron pair” can be rationalized
in terms of partial occupation of “non-Lewis” orbitals and
donor–acceptor interactions between molecular fragments.
Each NBO can be associated with a natural localized molecular
orbital (NLMO), which is exactly doubly occupied and results
from incorporation of mixings with non-Lewis orbital.[85] Thus,
when an NBO is identified as the donor orbital in an interac-
tion, the corresponding NLMO informs about the degree of
mixing with the acceptor orbital. In addition, donor–acceptor
stabilization energies (DEij) can be calculated that are related
to the strength of the interaction.
Table 4 summarizes relevant donor–acceptor interactions
and Wiberg bond orders (WBO) from the NBO analysis of the
RhI!M bonds. Typical NBO terminology has been used to
name the different types of NBOs, such as LP for lone pair, and
LV for lone vacancy, which refers to an empty valence orbital
localized on one atom. Also, the main atomic orbital contribu-
tion to the LVs has been included in parenthesis. The NLMO
column indicates the percentage of non-Lewis orbitals from
the acceptor atom that are mixed with the parent donor NBO.
This section does not aim at being comprehensive, but to illus-
trate representative interactions and to offer a qualitative pic-
ture of the Rh@M bonding. For instance, more than one LPRh!
LV interaction has been located for most systems whereas only
the most important is shown. Data for sRh-P!LV interactions
correspond to the average values of the interaction with the
two Rh@P bonds in each adduct. Finally, back donation is by

far one minor contribution to the Rh–tetrylene interactions,
but it has been highlighted to illustrate the ambiphilic behav-
ior of GeCl2 and SnCl2 in these adducts. Figure 6 and Figure 7
show examples of relevant NBOs and NLMOs for the above in-
teractions.
The NBO analysis locates 4 LPs, almost pure d orbitals, on
the Rh atoms of all adducts, except for 1·GeCl2 and the hy-
dride 2, for which only 3 d LPs where found. This agrees with a
RhI formulation and d8 electron count for most adducts and
the expected RhIII, d6, formulation for the hydride. In the case
of 1·GeCl2, a RhIII/Ge0 formulation cannot be assumed. Instead,
we propose that the [(h5-C5Me5)Rh(PMe3)2] moiety forms one
dative covalent bond with GeCl2, the latter acting effectively as
an Z-type ligand,[22a] as will be discussed in more detail later.
Inspection of the Rh d LPs of the formally RhI adducts shows
that at least one of them is populated by 1.82 electrons or
less, except for 1·Li and 1·Na, for which the relevant lowest oc-
cupied Rh LPs have 1.95 electrons each. The occupancy is
higher for the adducts of the more electropositive elements
and lower for the adducts of the more electronegative ones,
with the lowest occupancy found for 1·SnCl2 at 1.69 electrons.
This reflects, once more, a higher degree of electron sharing in
the adducts with the electronegative atoms. These Rh LPs are
delocalized onto LV NBOs of the acceptor metal atoms. Thus,
for s-block atoms, the acceptor LV is mostly a valence s orbital,
and the corresponding interaction can be described as d(Rh)!
s(M). The occupancy of the acceptor orbital and the major
donor-acceptor stabilization (or delocalization) energies (DEij)
for these interactions are: 0.05 electrons and 6.00 kcalmol@1
for 1·Li; 0.05 electrons and 6.71 kcalmol@1 for 1·Na; and 0.40
electrons and 28.7 kcalmol@1 for the MgBr2 adduct, 3.
However, in the above species, as well as in the remaining
adducts considered, the Rh!M interaction is dominated, at
least in terms of delocalization energies, not by Rh-localized d
orbitals, but by electron donation from the s(Rh-P) bonds,[31b]
which have about 72% P (sp) and 28% Rh (sd) character. For
the Li, Na and MgBr2 adducts the s(Rh-P)!s(M) interaction have
DEij of 22.5, 19.3, 41.3 kcalmol@1 respectively.
The NBO description of the Rh@M bonding in the adducts
with p-block acceptor atoms is more varied than above. Thus,
d(Rh)!sp3
(Al) and s(Rh-P)!sp3
(Al) donor–acceptor interactions were
located for 1·AlMe3, with the latter being the major contribu-
tion in terms of delocalization energy (DEij are 33.7 and
80.6 kcalmol@1 respectively). The occupancies of the donor
NBOs are 1.75 and 1.84 electrons for the Rh LP and the Al LV, a
valence sp3 hybrid, respectively. The Rh@M interactions in the
adducts with the two tetrylenes, 1·SnCl2 and 1·GeCl2, which
were assigned the highest covalent character according to the
AIM analysis, are described very differently by the NBO analy-
sis: whereas the donor–acceptor description is used for the
former, one bonding NBO was localized between Rh and Ge in
the latter (Figure 7). Close inspection of the NLMO associated
with the donor NBO of the d(Rh)!p(Sn) interaction in 1·SnCl2
(DEij=55.2 kcalmol@1) reveals that it has the highest mixing of
acceptor metal orbitals of all analogous NLMOs in this study,
with 81.9% Rh and 15% Sn composition,[86] whereas the NLMO
associated with the s(Rh-Ge) NBO of 1·GeCl2 has an even higher
mixing of Ge orbitals, although it is heavily weighted towards
the Rh atom: 71% Rh (sd2) and 23% Ge (p), with about 2%
mixing from each P atom. This can be compared with the s(Rh-
H) NBO of 2, which has about 55% Rh character and 45% H
character. The bonding in this case is pure covalent from the
localized orbital perspective. Nevertheless, the s(Rh-P)!p(Sn) in-
teraction is also dominant in 1·SnCl2,[31b] with DEij=62.8 kcal
mol@1. The involvement of the Rh@P bonds in the Rh@Ge inter-
action of 1·GeCl2 is described in terms of donor–acceptor in-
teractions: s(Rh-Ge)!s*(Rh-P) and s*(Rh-Ge)
!
s(Rh-P), and in the mixing
of P orbitals in the NLMO associated to the s(Rh-Ge) NBO. Ac-
cording to these results, the interaction in 1·GeCl2 is best de-

scribed as a dative covalent bond with the Rh fragment acting
as an L ligand, and a similar description, with a lower degree
of electron donation/sharing, could be used for 1·SnCl2, that is,
both can be equally described as MOLPs.
In addition, it is interesting to note that both tetrylenes
have LPs which are mostly filled valence s orbitals, which back
donate electron density onto antibonding s*(Rh-P) NBOs.[31b]
Back-donation to the [(h5-C5Me5)Rh(PMe3)2] is a minor contribu-
tion to the Rh@Ge and it es negligible, when detected (DEij,
1 kcalmol@1), in the remaining cases.
In the adducts with d-block acceptor atoms, the donor-ac-
ceptor interaction description has also been chosen. The Zn
and Cu atoms of 1·ZnMe3, 1·Zn(C6F5)2 and 1·CuCl accept elec-
tron density onto their 4s valence orbitals from Rh LP (d) and
s(Rh-P) NBOs. The degree of interaction, based on bond order,
occupancy of the donor and acceptor orbitals and donor–ac-
ceptor stabilization energies is intermediate between those of
s-block metals containing adducts and those of p-block metal
containing adducts, for which is greatest.
The magnitude of the Rh@M orbital interactions is reflected
in the WBOs, which roughly follow the same trends as 1b and
d(Rh,M), described above. Interestingly, some of these trends
can be used to explain, at least qualitatively the variation of
the Rh@P distances, which are shorter for adducts with smaller
WBOs for their Rh@M bonds (or 1b and d(Rh,M)) and longer for
adducts with larger WBOs (Figure 8). As the RhI!M interac-
tions become more important, there is a greater involvement
of s(Rh-P) orbitals (and in some cases weak back donation onto
s*(Rh-P)), therefore weakening the Rh@P bonds.
Conclusions
The choice of [(h5-C5Me5)Rh(PMe3) as a Lewis base for the syn-
thesis of unsupported MOLPs has proved highly successful. We
have prepared up to nine Rh-based bimetallic compounds of
this kind, providing X-ray diffraction structures for those con-
taining fragments MgMeBr, Zn(C6F5)2, ZnMe2, GeCl2, SnCl2 and
AlMe3. It is surprising that despite the wide use of some of
these Lewis acidic fragments, their corresponding MOLPs rep-
resent highly unusual examples of unsupported M@M bonding,
particularly in cases like those with a Rh!Mg (3) or a Rh!Al
(1·AlMe3) dative bonds. The growing interest on MOLPs is re-
flected by increased number of studies focusing either on ac-
cessing new structures or computationally investigating fami-
lies of compounds already prepared, whereas a combined
effort on a series of MOLPs is still lacking. We provide here a
comprehensive computational investigation on the Rh@M
bonding of the prepared Rh MOLPs, with several sound corre-
lations found for relevant parameters associated to the metal-
to-metal bond. For instance, the more electronegative atoms
(Ge, Sn, Al) tend to form more covalent bonds with rhodium,
whereas the ionic character becomes more prominent in the
least electronegative (Li, Na, Mg). Nevertheless, we have quan-
tified some degree of electron sharing for all investigated
MOLPs. Curiously, the Rh!M bond is dominated by electron
donation from the Rh@P s-bonds rather than from a filled Rh
d-orbital to the acidic site, which results in other relevant cor-
relation between Wiberg Bond Orders and Rh@P bond lengths.
Overall, we believe that this combined experimental/computa-
tional approach to Rh-based MOLPs will aid in the develop-
ment of other related systems for the advancement of this
growing field.
Experimental Section
General considerations: All preparations and manipulations were
carried out using standard Schlenk and glove-box techniques,
under an atmosphere of argon and of high purity nitrogen, respec-
tively. All solvents were dried, stored over 4 a molecular sieves,
and degassed prior to use. Toluene (C7H8) and n-pentane (C5H12)
were distilled under nitrogen over sodium. [D6]Benzene were dried
over molecular sieves (4 a). Tin dichloride was dried by vigorous
stirring with acetic anhydride, while copper(I) chloride by co-evap-
oration with toluene and drying under vacuum. Other chemicals
were commercially available and used as received. For elemental
analyses a LECO TruSpec CHN elementary analyzer, was utilized.
NMR Spectroscopy: Solution NMR spectra were recorded on
Bruker AMX-300, DRX-400 and DRX-500 spectrometers. Spectra
were referenced to external SiMe4 (d: 0 ppm) using the residual
proton solvent peaks as internal standards (1H NMR experiments),
or the characteristic resonances of the solvent nuclei (13C NMR ex-
periments), whereas 31P was referenced to H3PO4. Spectral assign-
ments were made by routine one- and two-dimensional NMR ex-
periments where appropriate.103Rh NMR was acquired at 15.9 MHz
using an observe 5 mm triple resonance broadband probe (broad-
band inner coil and doubly tuned 1H/31P outer coil) with 908 pulses
of 37.5 ms and 30.0 ms for 103Rh and 31P, respectively. 103Rh chemical
shifts, d, are given in ppm relative to X=3.186447[87] (reference
compound Rh(acac)3, where acac stands for [CH3COCHCOCH3]@)
and derived indirectly from the
31P-103Rh HMQC experiments by
four pulse 31P@103Rh HMQC experiments with 1H decoupling during
acquisition. Note that despite the fact that IUPAC recommends the
use of Rh(acac)3 as the reference, the alternative Xi value X=
3.160000 for Rh metal has been commonly employed in the litera-
ture. The experiments were optimized using the 1JRhP values ob-
tained from the corresponding 31P{1H} spectra. The transmitter fre-
quency offset and the spectral width were varied to ensure that no
signals were folded. 2D data were zero filled and processed with
exponential line broadening of 10 Hz in the direct F2 dimension,
and unshifted sine-bell window function in the indirect F1 dimen-
sion.

General synthesis of rhodium MOLPs. Method A: A solid mixture
of 1 (30 mg, 0.077 mmol) and the corresponding Lewis acid
(0.077 mmol: GeCl2·dioxane, 36 mg; SnCl2, 15 mg; CuCl, 7.6 mg;
Zn(C6F5)2, 30 mg) is placed in a Schlenk flask and dissolved in tolu-
ene (4 mL; for Zn(C6F5)2) or bromobenzene (4 mL; for GeCl2, SnCl2
and CuCl) under argon atmosphere. The solution is stirred for one
hour at 258C and pentane (10 mL) is subsequently added. The re-
sulting solid is filtrated, dried under vacuum and washed with pen-
tane to provide the resultant MOLPs as orange to brown solids in
moderate to good yields (vide infra). Method B. A toluene (4 mL)
solution of 1 (30 mg, 0.077 mmol) placed in a Schlenk flask was
charged with a solution of the corresponding Lewis acid (ZnMe2,
AlMe3 or MeMgBr, 1m in toluene or Et2O, 77 mL, 0.077 mmol) and
stirred for one hour at 258C. Then pentane (10 mL) is added and
the resulting solid filtrated, dried under reduced pressure and
washed with pentane to provide the resultant MOLPs as orange to
brown solids in moderate to good yields (vide infra). In the case of
ZnMe2 drying of the MOLP is carried out by a flow of argon, since
under reduced pressure ZnMe2 is readily eliminated. Single crystals
of compounds 1·GeCl2, 1·SnCl2, 1·AlMe3, 1·ZnMe2, 1·Zn(C6F5)2 and
3 were grown from slow diffusion of pentane into their benzene
or bromobenzene solutions. The analogous procedures carried out
in J. Young NMR tubes between 1 (14 mg, 0.036 mmol) and equi-
molar amounts of the corresponding Lewis acids lead in all cases
to formation of the reported MOLPs in quantitative spectroscopic
yields.

[77] The above relationships arise from the Virial theorem, which stablishes
a connection between energetics of atomic interactions and the elec-
tron density (1/4r21b=Vb+2Gb), and from the definition of total
energy density: Hb=Vb+Gb. Thus, if Hb <0 (the potential energy densi-
ty dominates the interaction) then jVbj/Gb>1 and when jVbj/Gb>2,
then r21b <0, since Vb is always negative.
