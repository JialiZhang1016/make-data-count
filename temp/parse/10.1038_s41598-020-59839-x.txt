harsh environments

The Djallonké (West African Dwarf) sheep is a small-sized haired sheep resulting from a costly 
evolutionary process of natural adaptation to the harsh environment of West Africa including 
trypanosome challenge. However, genomic studies carried out in this sheep are scant. In this research, 
genomic data of 184 Djallonké sheep (and 12 Burkina-Sahel sheep as an outgroup) generated using 
medium-density SNP Chips were analyzed. Three different statistics (iHS, XP-EHH and nSL) were 
applied to identify candidate selection sweep regions spanning genes putatively associated with 
adaptation of sheep to the West African environment. A total of 207 candidate selection sweep 
regions were defined. Gene-annotation enrichment and functional annotation analyses allowed to 
identify three statistically significant functional clusters involving 12 candidate genes. Genes included 
in Functional Clusters associated to selection signatures were mainly related to metabolic response 
to stress, including regulation of oxidative and metabolic stress and thermotolerance. The bovine 
chromosomal areas carrying QTLs for cattle trypanotolerance were compared with the regions on 
which the orthologous functional candidate cattle genes were located. The importance of cattle BTA4 
for trypanotolerant response might have been conserved between species. The current research 
provides new insights on the genomic basis for adaptation and highlights the importance of obtaining 
information from non-cosmopolite livestock populations managed in harsh environments.
Drift and selection may cause selective sweep signatures on the genome, characterized by reduced diversity and 
extensive linkage disequilibrium. Favorable alleles increase in frequency more rapidly than expected for a neu-
tral genetic scenario and further alter the allele frequencies of genomic variants near the beneficial mutation. 
The identification of signatures of selection has been carried out on several sheep breeds using genome-wide 
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data1. Most analyses allowed to identify signatures of positive selection 
for economically important traits such as parasite resistance2, dairy production3–5, meat yield and growth4,6,7, fat 
metabolism and deposition8–10 or reproduction11,12. Other traits affecting breeds’ definition such as morphology, 
horn shape or coat color have caused selective sweeps on the sheep genome as well6,12,13.
However, there is an increasing interest in identifying selection signatures caused by human-mediated selec-
tion pressure for adaptation to different environmental conditions contrasting in climate (mainly precipitations 
and temperature), vegetation and altitude10,14–17. This approach allows to identify sheep populations (or breeds) 
more robustly suited to future climate changes and to obtain new insights on the history of the species after 
domestication.
Domestication and dissemination of sheep is a complex process, initiated about 11,000 years before present 
(yBP), which included different waves, specialization for different production goals and adaptation to different 
environmental conditions18. When compared with Northern Africa, the initial appearance of pastoralist commu-
nities based on small stock in Sub-Saharan West Africa may have been delayed by thousand years19. Reviewing 
the literature, Muiga and Hanotte20 suggested that domestic sheep entered into central Nile valley and central 
Sahara around 6,000 yBP reaching West Africa by 3,700 yBP. This lag in successful introduction of small ruminant

livestock into West Africa stems from new animal diseases encountered by pastoral colonists entering biogeo-
graphic zones south of the Sahel, namely trypanosomiasis19. Native West African domestic ruminants (cattle, 
sheep and goat) share distinctive traits, namely trypanotolerance and small size. These species were subject to 
similar processes of adaptation to an extremely difficult environmental scenario and to trypanosome challenge20.
Djallonké (West African Dwarf) sheep21,22 are a small sized haired sheep population spread in the humid West 
and Central African regions. Djallonké sheep have the ability to maintain undepressed production and reproduc-
tion performance under parasite challenge even in the presence of a persistent parasitaemia. Therefore, they are 
considered resilient to trypanosome challenge23.
Most studies aiming at the identification of selective sweeps on the sheep genome have been carried out 
using highly structured populations including different cosmopolitan (commercial) and local sheep breeds4,6,24. 
Although there exist methodologies accounting for population structuring, such as hapFLK25, genetic heteroge-
neity amongst breeds carrying distinct mutations with similar phenotypic effects may lead selective sweeps to not 
reach statistical significance, particularly when sample size is moderate4.
In this research, genomic data generated using medium-density Chips on a sample of Burkina Faso Djallonké 
sheep were assessed to identify candidate selection sweep regions spanning genes associated with different biolog-
ical pathways putatively involved in the adaptation of sheep to the environmental conditions of the humid areas 
of West Africa. The genomic profile of this population, compared with that of a small sample of Burkina-Sahel 
sheep when necessary, was explored for signatures of selection using various Extended Haplotype Homozygosity 
(EHH-)based statistics26. The corresponding cattle orthologous genomic regions were compared with the bovine 
chromosomal areas in which Quantitative Traits Loci (QTL) for trypanotolerance–related traits have been 
reported27.
Methods
Sample used. 
A total of 184 DNA samples of Djallonké lambs (64 males and 120 females) previously 
analyzed using microsatellites28 were available. Up to 166 individuals were sampled in the surroundings of 
Mangodara (latitude 9°53′59.99″N; longitude 4°20′59.99″W; Comoé province), southern Burkina Faso. The 
other 18 individuals (9 males and 9 females) were sampled in Dédougou (latitude 12°27′48.17″N; longitude 
3°27′38.7″W; Mouhoun province), southwestern Burkina Faso. Both sampling areas belong to the environmental 
Sudan-Guinea Savannah humid region (tse-tse challenged) of Burkina Faso21,22. The Sudan-Guinea Savannah 
environmental region has annual rainfall higher than 900 millimeters (with precipitations in Mangodara and 
Dédougou varying from 1,000 to 1,200 millimeters per year), predominance of woodlands and savannahs, and 
temperatures varying from 19 °C to 36 °C29. Additionally, 12 individuals belonging to the Burkina-Sahel sheep 
breed were sampled in the surroundings of Dori (latitude 14°02′7.44″N; longitude 0°02′4.20″E; Séno Province), 
located on the arid environmental Sahel region of Northern Burkina Faso, to be used as an outgroup. The Sahel 
environmental region has less than 600 millimeters of rainfall per year, temperatures varying from 15 °C to 43 °C 
and bushy vegetation29. Morphological and genetic description of both the Djallonké and the Burkina-Sahel 
sheep populations of Burkina Faso is available in the literature21,22,30. The management of the Djallonké sheep of 
Burkina Faso has been described as well31. Sheep breeding in Burkina Faso is based on small-holders and carried 
out in extensive conditions with no supplementation. In the Sudan-Sahel environmental area, animals perform 
communal grazing of native pasture with no restrictions during the dry season and about 12 hours a day during 
the rainy season. In the Sahel area, management system is traditional and extensive with little or no management 
inputs: shelter or minerals. Sheep are managed by their owners (Fulani ethnic group). Communal grazing is less 
frequent. In all cases, use of fodder crops and conserved forages is negligible. Planned matings are not usual.
SNP genotyping and quality control. 
The whole dataset was typed using the Ovine 50 K SNP BeadChip 
following standard protocols (http://www.illumina.com). The software GenomeStudio (Illumina Inc., San Diego, 
CA) was used to generate standard.ped and map files. Sample and marker-based quality control measures were 
performed using the program PLINK V 1.0932. GenCall score cutoff of 0.15 and average sample call rate of 99% 
were considered. All unmapped SNPs, those mapping to sexual chromosomes, SNPs with a genotyping rate lower 
than 90% or those below a Minor Allele Frequency threshold of 0.05 were removed. To avoid departures from 
Hardy-Weinberg proportions due to genotyping errors, SNPs that did not pass Hardy-Weinberg test for P ≤ 0.001 
were removed as well. A total of 46,977 SNPs located on the 26 ovine autosomes passed the quality control for the 
whole sample analyzed.
Diversity and population structuring analyses. 
Genetic diversity of the available population was 
assessed using the software VCFtools33. Within subpopulation (Djallonké and Burkina-Sahel) inbreeding and 
between subpopulations FST were computed.
A clustering analysis was carried out using the program Admixture v1.2334,35 which calculates maximum 
likelihood estimates of individual ancestries based on data provided by multiple loci. Analyses were conducted 
for 1 ≤ K ≤ 8 being K the number of clusters given the data. The optimal number of clusters was determined via 
cross-validation as the value of K exhibiting the lower cross-validation error compared to other K values. Data 
set was divided into 5 folders for each K. Folders were sequentially used as test sets while the other four were used 
for training.
The program PLINK V 1.0932 was used to compute Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Eigenvectors com-
puted for each individual were used to construct dispersion plots accounting for the Admixture Cluster to which 
individuals were assigned. The 75% confidence regions of the relationships among individuals within cluster were 
illustrated using contour plots. Plots were constructed using the library ggplot2 of R (http://CRAN.R-project.
org/).

Identification of selective sweeps. 
Three complementary EHH-based statistics, integrated Haplotype 
Score36 (iHS), XP-EHH37 and nSL38, were used to assess genome-wide signatures of selection in Djallonké sheep. 
These three approaches were proposed to overcome the main concern affecting the original EHH test26 i.e. the 
yield of a high number of false positives due to the strong influence on results of the demographic history of the 
population under studied.
The iHS test compares the EHH between derived and ancestral alleles within a population searching for loci 
where the derived allele resides on a longer haplotype than the ancestral allele36. In this way, the iHS values are less 
affected by the demographic history of the population and are more suitable for identifying incomplete sweeps, 
where the selected allele is not fixed in the sample.
The XP-EHH test compares the frequencies of the selected haplotypes between two populations to detect 
ongoing or nearly fixed selection signatures37. Therefore, the XP-EHH test is more robust than the EHH statistics 
in scenarios of complete selective sweeps. This test has an increased power to detect selection signatures using 
small sample sizes and allows to use groups of genetically similar populations.
In contrast to iHS and XP-EHH, which measures the length of haplotypes in terms of genetic distance and 
thereby uses recombination, the nSL statistics38 measures haplotype lengths in terms of the number of segregat-
ing sites in the sample, making it more robust to recombination rate variations. In addition, although both iHS 
and nSL target at the identification of incomplete sweeps, the nSL statistic has improved power in detecting soft 
sweeps38.
Both large positive and negative iHS, XP-EHH and nSL scores were considered potentially informative. 
Although negative iHS scores would mean that a derived allele would have swept up in frequency and, there-
fore, could be considered of more interest, large positive values can indicate that ancestral alleles hitchhike with 
the selected site39. Furthermore, scenarios in which selection switch to favor an ancestral allele cannot be dis-
carded. Similar rationale can be applied to the recombination-free counterpart of iHS, the nSL test. In the case of 
XP-EHH scores large positive and negative values would identify selection events in the studied population and 
in the reference population, respectively. Both cases are informative in scenarios of poor differentiation.
All estimates were carried out using the program selscan v.1.0.440, freely available at http://github.com/
szpiech/selscan, fitting the parameters recommended by the authors: maximum EHH extension in bp (“–
max-extend” option) 1000000, maximum gap allowed between two SNPs in bp (“–max-gap” option) 200000, 
EHH decay cutoff (“–cutoff” option) 0.05. Whatever the statistics computed, the output results for each SNP were 
frequency-normalized over all chromosomes using the program norm, provided with selscan. This normalization 
was carried out using default parameters as well: number of frequency bins (“–bins” option) 100. As implemented 
by default in the program norm, normalized values higher than |2| were used to identify SNPs under selection.
The program selscan is ‘dumb’ with respect ancestral/derived alleles, simply assigning the “reference” allele 
depending on previous arbitrary allele coding40. Unstandardized iHS scores are then computed as ln(iHH1/
iHH0)40, being iHH the integrated haplotype homozygosity for the ancestral (0) and derived (1) haplotypes. 
There is empirical evidence suggesting that iHS values obtained from a given subset of SNPs with or without 
ancestral allele information (i.e. random assignment) are highly consistent41. Therefore, this has been proved to 
be a reliable strategy.
Previous studies aiming at the ascertainment of the genomic diversity in Djallonké sheep used as reference 
population Sahel sheep sampled in the same geographical area42. Therefore, Burkina-Sahel individuals were used 
for the XP-EHH analyses.
Candidate selection sweep regions were defined starting from: a) individual SNPs identified as being under 
selection by at least two of the statistics applied; and b) adjacent SNPs identified as being under selection by at 
least two different statistics. Two SNPs were considered adjacent if their 75 kb up- or down-stream regions over-
lapped. All other SNPs identified as being under selection by any statistics with their 75 kb up- or down-stream 
regions sequentially intersecting with the 75 kb regions surrounding the SNPs selected using the strategies a) and 
b) described above were assigned to the corresponding selection sweep region.
Functional characterization of the candidate regions. 
Candidate genes were considered if their 
boundaries fell within 75 kb up- or down-stream the selection sweep regions defined. Protein-coding genes found 
within the candidate regions were retrieved from the Ensembl Genes 91 database, based on the Oar v3.1 ovine ref-
erence genome (http://www.livestockgenomics.csiro.au/sheep/oar3.1.php) using the BioMart tool43. The Ensembl 
Genes 91 database and the BioMart tool were also used to identify the corresponding orthologous cattle genes, 
based on the UMD3.1 bovine reference genome. All the identified genes were processed using the functional 
annotation tool implemented in DAVID Bioinformatics resources 6.844 to determine enriched functional terms. 
An enrichment score of 1.3, which is equivalent to the Fisher exact test P-value of 0.05, was used as a threshold 
to define the significantly enriched functional terms in comparison to the whole bovine reference genome back-
ground. Relationships among genomic features in different chromosome positions were represented using the R 
software package shinyCircos45.
Overlap with cattle trypanotorelance-related QTLs. 
The bovine QTLs for trypanotolerance–related 
traits27 which were mapped on the bovine Btau 4.0 reference genome assembly were downloaded from the cattle 
QTL database (http://www.animalgenome.org/cgi-bin/QTLdb/BT/index). The QTL genome coordinates were 
then re-mapped on the bovine UMD 3.1 reference genome assembly using the NCBI genome remapping online 
service (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/tools/remap). The intersectBed function of the BedTools soft-
ware46 was used to overlap these trypanotolerance-related QTLs with the bovine regions on which the ortholo-
gous functional ovine candidate genes identified were located.

Results
Genetic diversity and structuring of data. 
Mean inbreeding (and standard deviation) in Djallonké sheep 
was of 0.058 ± 0.070. This was higher than the value computed for the Burkina-Sahel sample (0.014 ± 0.020). 
Differentiation between Djallonké and Burkina-Sahel sheep, assessed computing weighted Weir and Cockerham’s 
FST, was 0.066.
The results of the admixture analysis informed that the lowest cross-validation error was at K = 4 (Fig. 1). 
However, differences between cross-validation errors for K = 3, K = 4 and K = 5 were lower than 0.005. Most 
Djallonké individuals (144 for K = 3, 145 for K = 4 and 140 for K = 5) grouped into a single Cluster. However, 
assignment of the Burkina-Sahel individuals into a given Cluster was not clear. No differentiation was found 
between Djallonké sheep sampled either in Mangodara or Dédougou. Most Dédougou samples (from 75% for 
K = 5 to 100% for K = 3) clustered within the main group formed by Mangodara samples.
Furthermore, most Burkina-Sahel individuals (10) clustered with Djallonké individuals for K = 3 (Fig. 1B). 
Although Burkina-Sahel individuals tended to form particular Clusters for K = 4 and K = 5 (Figs. 1C,D), they 
shared these Clusters with a number of Djallonké individuals for K = 4 (4) and for K = 5 (7).

total variance, respectively. Contour plots illustrate the 75% confidence region of the relationships among 
the individuals assigned to each Cluster identified using Admixture v1.23 for K = 3 (Plot B), K = 4 (Plot C)

PCA identified 19 factors with eigenvalue higher than 1 which accounted for a total of 25.1% of the genetic 
variance. Figure 1 shows the dispersion of the individuals and the 75% confidence region of the relationships 
between individuals assigned to each Cluster identified using Admixture v1.23. Independently of the number of K 
considered, PCA did not allow to assess a clear separation of the individuals. This was particularly remarkable for 
K = 3 (Fig. 1B) in which the 75% confidence region of dispersion of the individuals assigned to each of the three 
clusters overlapped. Although this did not happen for K = 4 and K = 5, PCA illustrated a weak structure in the 
population analyzed: a significant number of individuals assigned to different clusters were highly intermingled 
in the middle of the plots.
Candidate regions under selection. 
Figure 2 shows the Manhattan plots illustrating the SNPs identified 
as being under selection pressure on all ovine autosomes according to the three tests assayed. After normalization 
974 SNPs (Supplementary Table S1), 1,633 (Supplementary Table S2) and 110 (Supplementary Table S3) SNPs 
were considered to be under selection using the iHS, XP-EHH and nSL tests, respectively.
After crossing the output of the three tests applied, a total of 207 candidate selection sweep regions on all auto-
somes, except for OAR20 and OAR21, were defined (Table 1; Supplementary Table S4). These regions comprised a 
total of 34,957,703 bp and 555 different SNPs. Up to 153 SNPs were identified as being under selection by two dif-
ferent statistics. Four chromosomes (OAR1, 2, 3 and 23) gathered 46% of the candidate selection sweep regions.
Identification of functional candidate genes linked to selection sweeps. 
Gene-annotation enrich-
ment analysis allowed to identify a total of 491 potential candidate ovine genes in the 75 kb up- and down-stream 
regions surrounding the selection sweep regions defined previously. A full description of these 491 ovine genes, 
including their identification, description and location is given in Supplementary Table S5. Details on the corre-
sponding orthologous cattle genes are given in Supplementary Table S5 as well.
Functional annotation conducted on these genes allowed to identify 22 different functional term clusters 
(Supplementary Table S6). However, only three functional term clusters were significantly enriched (enrich-
ment score higher than 1.3; Table 2; Fig. 3). Functional Cluster 1 (enrichment score = 3.24) included four genes 
(ALB, GC, AFP and AFM) involved in transport functions of the plasma membrane and homeostasis. Functional 
Cluster 2 (enrichment score = 1.39) included four genes (MC2R, CIB1, MC5R and CAV1) involved in angio-
genesis, answer to ischemia and hypoxia. Functional Cluster 3 (enrichment score = 1.31) included four genes 
(LDLRAD4, LRP11, CFI and VLDLR) involved in lipid metabolism and response to temperature stress.
A description of the genes involved in the definition of these three functional clusters is given in Table 3. The 
four genes forming Functional Cluster 1 were located on OAR6 and in close vicinity spanning a chromosomal 
area of 87,639 bp (from position 88,136,611 to position 88,224,250). Functional Cluster 3 included gene CFI 
which was located on OAR6 as well, although on a distant area. Functional Clusters 2 and 3 had neighboring 
genes located on OAR23 (genes MC2R and MC5R for Cluster 2 and gene LDLRAD4 for Cluster 3) on an area 
spanning 247,960 bp.
Correspondence with cattle trypanotolerance-related QTLs. 
The relationship between the orthol-
ogous cattle genes listed in Table 3 and the cattle QTLs reported for trypanotolerance-related traits27 are given 
in Supplementary Table S7. Only the cattle gene CAV1, assigned to Functional Cluster 2, intersected with a QTL 
(QTL ID no. 10515) reported on BTA4 for trypanosomes’ load.
Discussion
As expected22,47, the population analyzed is poorly structured. This is true even if the Burkina-Sahel individuals 
are considered (Fig. 1). This situation is consistent with the more common West African livestock scenario in 
which no artificial selection programmes exist and long-distance livestock trading is intense.
Although Sahelian and Djallonké sheep show large morphological differences and are expected to have differ-
ent ancestral origins21,22, the Burkina-Sahel sheep do not show a clear separation from the Djallonké individuals 
(Fig. 1). At the neutral loci level, it is assumed that genetic differentiation in West African livestock ruminant pop-
ulations is basically due to geographic distance47,48. Morphology, production goals or differences in origin do not 
result in high genetic differentiation. The poor genetic structuring identified may be due to different unobserved 
founder events underlying data as a consequence of a very traditional management system in which unplanned 
natural matings are the rule28.
In scenarios of poor differentiation amongst individuals, the use of EHH-based tests to identify genomic 
areas under selection is preferable to FST-based methods which need at least two different populations in data-
set1. We further tested this running the software BayeScan v. 2.149 on our Djallonké genotypes. Only four SNPs 
(OAR1_22330907.1, OAR12_17378202.1, s56240.1 on OAR14 and OAR16_10423797.1) were identified as being 
under diversifying selection (positive α values). The inclusion of the Burkina-Sahel individuals in the analyses 
allowed to identify ten SNPs under diversifying selection (Supplementary Table S8). However, the set of SNPs 
listed above and their 75 kb up- or down-stream regions did not overlap with the genomic regions surrounding 
the SNPs identified using EHH-based tests.
The 207 selection sweep regions identified in Djallonké sheep spanned about 35 Mbp which is about 1.3% of 
the roughly 2.65 Gbp covered by SNPs typed. These figures are consistent with those reported in previous works 
using similar conservative criteria in the definition of selection signatures. The concordant genomic regions 
identified using two different EHH-based statistics on three different sheep breeds (Sunite, German Mutton and 
Dorper) typed with the same SNP Chip used here spanned chromosomal regions summing up from 1,049,753 bp 
(Dorper) to 1,507,244 bp (Sunite)24. The analysis of the genomic profile, using three different methods (FST, iSH 
and RsB), of three Brazilian sheep breeds gave only 5 (out of 246) coincident selection signatures12. When only 
two tests were considered the number of coincident selection signatures was 3712.

Biological importance of the functional clusters identified. 
Gene-annotation enrichment analysis 
carried out allowed to identify various functional term clusters involved in signaling pathways associated directly 
or indirectly with environmental adaptation, such as control of metabolic stress, homeostasis, modulation of 
immune and inflammatory responses, cell proliferation and migration (Supplementary Table S6). The statistically 
significant Functional Clusters identified depicted particular genetic aspects of adaptation to harsh environments. 
Although some of the genes included in such Functional Clusters are involved in immune response (e.g. GC and 
CFI genes), they are mainly related to metabolic response to stress.

Functional Cluster 1 included four genes (ALB, GC, AFP and AFM) belonging to the family of albumin genes. 
Because of their location at the same chromosome locus and in the same transcriptional orientation across spe-
cies, they are proposed to originate from common predecessor and to be cooperatively regulated50. Albumin 
(ALB) is involved on transport of metals, fatty acids, cholesterol, bile pigments, and drugs. It is a key element in 
the regulation of osmotic pressure and distribution of fluid between different compartments. In general, albumin 
represents the major and predominant antioxidant in plasma, a body compartment known to be exposed to con-
tinuous oxidative stress51. Variants of the albumin genes family, including the fetal counterpart of serum albumin 
(AFP) and afamin/alpha-albumin (AFM) genes, are associated with the development of the metabolic syndrome 
in adult humans52,53. In turn, the GC gene is part of the complement system, a key component of innate immunity 
and susceptibility to diseases with a major role in tissue homeostasis, degeneration, and regeneration54. The GC 
gene has major functions including the modulation of immune and inflammatory responses via regulation of 
chemotaxis and macrophage activation, transport by binding of fatty acids in collaboration with albumin and 
control of bone development55.
Functional Cluster 2 included two genes (MC2R and MC5R) encoding proteins belonging to the G 
protein-coupled receptors family involved in the response to stress via binding plasma adrenocorticotropin hor-
mone (ACTH). While the MC2R gene acts on adrenal steroidogenesis and regulation of the glucocorticoid axis, 
the MC5R gene regulates the function of sebaceous glands with effect on water repulsion and thermoregulation56. 
In turn, the CIB1 gene encodes a protein involved in cell proliferation, particularly proplatelets, therefore acting 
on thrombopoiesis57, while the CAV1 gene has a critical role in signal transduction and trafficking for its interplay 
with steroid receptors and is associated with the metabolic syndrome in humans58.
Genes assigned to Functional Cluster 3 have a major role on response to stress and immunity. The LDLRAD4 
gene encodes a protein involved in the regulation of the transforming growth factor- ß (TGF-ß) signaling59 which 
plays a pivotal role in cell differentiation, apoptosis, cell migration, production of matrix proteins, angiogenesis, 
and anti-proliferative responsiveness. The VLDLR gene is also involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and 
migration60. Another low density lipoprotein receptor gene belonging to this Cluster (LPR11) is associated with 
chronic stress caused by food or water deprivation or elevated or cold temperature61. Finally, the complement 
factor I (CFI) gene encodes a serine protease forming part of the complement system, which is involved in innate 
and adaptive immune responses for prevention and control of diseases62.
General discussion on adaptation to West African environment.

ing candidate genes of functional importance identified in the current study are, in general, different to those

previously reported in the literature. This is not surprising in the case of works aiming at the characterization 
of the effect on the sheep genome of directional selection for dairy3,5 or meat traits6,7. However, interestingly 
enough, it also occurred when reports aiming at the identification of genomic signals of adaptation to extreme 
environments were considered. It is worth pointing out that most studies in this field aimed at the identification of 
genomic areas related to adaptation to high altitude10,17 or to high temperature in basically arid environments15,63. 
Such works involved several sheep populations bred in different geographical areas highly contrasting in envi-
ronments, production systems and goals14,15,63. Therefore, the ability to identify selection signatures related to 
thermotolerance or hypoxia may be affected by the influence of others more likely linked to production or repro-
duction performance.
The Djallonké population analyzed here is a homogeneous population managed in a harsh, hot and humid 
environment subject to different disease challenges, namely trypanosomosis23. Although it is assumed that genes 
related to immune response and thermotolerance are basic for environmental adaptation, the lack of concordance 
between the genomic signals identified here and those previously reported would suggest that the genomic areas 
involved in resistance to hot climate stress may be different if they are identified in populations bred either in 
humid or arid areas. In this respect, the genomic areas conserved between sheep and goat indigenous to the hot

arid environment of Egypt63 are completely different than those identified as functionally important in Djallonké 
sheep. In any case, it cannot be discarded that the history of the population is affecting results. The only coin-
cidence between our study and others in the literature is a selection signature on OAR23 carrying out genes 
MC5R and MC2R in Ethiopian Menz and Red Maasai breeds (East African sheep)13. While the Ethiopian Menz 
is a fat-tailed coarse wooled sheep probably descending from very ancient importations from Arabia (http://eth.
dagris.info/node/2448), the Red Maasai is a hair sheep like Djallonké, although medium to large body sized, with 
well known resistance to gastrointestinal parasites64.
Trypanosome challenge has been hypothesized to be a major historical force influencing the formation of 
native West African domestic ruminant populations including Djallonké sheep19. In consequence, we could 
expect that orthologous cattle chromosomal areas in which some QTLs for trypanotolerance related traits were 
previously identified27 would coincide with the genomic areas harboring genes of functional importance for adap-
tation in Djallonké sheep. However, only one orthologous candidate gene located on BTA4 (CAV1) had a clear 
relationship with those QTLs.
QTL information on cattle trypanotolerance was refined experimental herds65 and outbred popula-
tions66,67. Such analyses suggested that QTLs located on BTA2, BTA4 and BTA7 (with genes ARHGAP1565, 
TICAM165, CXCR466 and INHBA67 being the stronger candidates to underlie these QTLs) could have a major 
role on cattle trypanotolerance response. Although recent analyses failed in identifying causal mutations on 
the cattle ARHGAP15, TICAM1, CXCR4 and INHBA genes68–70 the importance of BTA2, BTA4 and BTA7 for

trypanotolerance cannot be neglected. The case of BTA4 would have been confirmed by the current analy-
ses. Moreover, the sheep chromosomal areas orthologous to the QTLs reported on BTA4 (OAR4) might have 
been conserved between species to play a role for adaptation to the same harsh environment and trypanosome 
challenge.
In summary, the genome of the Djallonké sheep provided new insights on the genomic basis for adapta-
tion. This sheep population is subject to the particularly harsh environment of the hot-humid, trypanosome 
challenged, West Africa. The genomic areas identified are associated with innate immunity and thermotoler-
ance. Results further suggest that genes involved in the regulation of oxidative and metabolic stress can be tar-
get of research for the ascertainment of the genetic basis of adaptation. Moreover, our findings suggest that the 
functional importance of cattle BTA4 for trypanotolerant response might have been conserved between species. 
Furthermore, our findings highlight the importance of obtaining information from non-cosmopolite livestock 
populations managed in particularly harsh environments.
