Abstract 
28 
Prostate cancer is the second most occurring cancer in men worldwide. To better 
29 
understand the mechanisms of tumorigenesis and possible treatment responses, we 
30 
developed a mathematical model of prostate cancer which considers the major signalling 
31 
pathways known to be deregulated. We personalised this Boolean model to molecular data 
32 
to reflect the heterogeneity and specific response to perturbations of cancer patients. 488 
33 
prostate samples were used to build patient-specific models and compared to available 
34 
clinical data. Additionally, eight prostate cell-line-specific models were built to validate our 
35 
approach with dose-response data of several drugs. The effects of single and combined 
36 
drugs were tested in these models under different growth conditions. We identified 15 
37 
actionable points of interventions in one cell-line-specific model whose inactivation hinders 
38 
tumorigenesis. To validate these results, we tested nine small molecule inhibitors of five of 
39 
those putative targets and found a dose-dependent effect on four of them, notably those 
40 
targeting HSP90 and PI3K. These results highlight the predictive power of our personalised 
41 
Boolean models and illustrate how they can be used for precision oncology. 
42 
Introduction 
43 
Like most cancers, prostate cancer arises from mutations in single somatic cells that induce 
44 
deregulations in processes such as proliferation, invasion of adjacent tissues and 
45 
metastasis. Not all prostate patients respond to the treatments in the same way, depending 
46 
on the stage and type of their tumour (Chen and Zhou, 2016) and differences in their genetic 
47 
and epigenetic profiles (Toth et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2018). The high heterogeneity of these 
48 
profiles can be explained by a large number of interacting proteins and the complex cross-
49 
talks between the cell signalling pathways that can be altered in cancer cells. Because of 
50 
this complexity, understanding the process of tumorigenesis and tumour growth would 
51 
benefit from a systemic and dynamical description of the disease. At the molecular level, this 
52 
can be tackled by a simplified mechanistic cell-wide model of protein interactions of the 
53 
underlying pathways, dependent on external environmental signals.  
54 
Although continuous mathematical modelling has been widely used to study cellular 
55 
biochemistry dynamics (e.g., ordinary differential equations) (Goldbeter, 2002; Kholodenko 
56 
et al., 1995; Le Novère, 2015; Sible and Tyson, 2007; Tyson et al., 2019), this formalism 
57 
does not scale up well to large signalling networks, due to the difficulty of estimating kinetic 
58 
parameter values (Babtie and Stumpf, 2017). In contrast, the logical (or logic) modelling 
59 
formalism represents a simpler means of abstraction where the causal relationships between 
60 
proteins (or genes) are encoded with logic statements, and dynamical behaviours are 
61 
represented by transitions between discrete states of the system (Kauffman, 1969; Thomas, 
62 
1973). In particular, Boolean models, the simplest implementation of logical models, 
63 
describe each protein as a binary variable (ON/OFF). This framework is flexible, requires in 
64 
principle no quantitative information, can be hence applied to large networks combining 
65 
multiple pathways, and can also provide a qualitative understanding of molecular systems 
66 
lacking detailed mechanistic information. 
67 
In the last years, logical and, in particular, Boolean modelling has successfully been used to 
68 
describe the dynamics of human cellular signal transduction and gene regulations (Calzone 
69 
et al., 2010; Cho et al., 2016; Flobak et al., 2015; Grieco et al., 2013; Helikar et al., 2008; 
70 
Traynard et al., 2016) and their deregulation in cancer (Fumiã and Martins, 2013; Hu et al., 
71 
2015). Numerous applications of logical modelling have shown that this framework is able to 
72 
delineate the main dynamical properties of complex biological regulatory networks (Abou-
73 
Jaoudé et al., 2011; Faure et al., 2006). 
74 
However, the Boolean approach is purely qualitative and does not consider the real time of 
75 
cellular events (half time of proteins, triggering of apoptosis, etc.). To cope with this issue, 
76 
we developed the MaBoSS software to compute continuous Markov Chain simulations on 
77 
the model state transition graph (STG), in which a model state is defined as a vector of 
78 
nodes that are either active or inactive. In practice, MaBoSS associates transition rates for 
79 
activation and inhibition of each node of the network, enabling it to account for different time 
80 
scales of the processes described by the model. Given some initial conditions, MaBoSS 
81 
applies a Monte-Carlo kinetic algorithm (or Gillespie algorithm) to the STG to produce time 
82 
trajectories (Stoll et al., 2017, 2012) such that time evolution of the model state probabilities 
83 
can be estimated. Stochastic simulations can easily explore the model dynamics with 
84 
different initial conditions by varying the probability of having a node active at the beginning 
85 
of the simulations and by modifying the model such that it accounts for genetic and 
86 
environmental perturbations (e.g., presence or absence of growth factors, or death 
87 
receptors). For each case, the effect on the probabilities of selected read-outs can be 
88 
measured (Cohen et al., 2015; Montagud et al., 2017). 
89 
When summarising the biological knowledge into a network and translating it into logical 
90 
terms, the obtained model is generic and cannot explain the differences and heterogeneity 
91 
between patients’ responses to treatments. Models can be trained with dedicated 
92 
perturbation experiments (Dorier et al., 2016; Saez-Rodriguez et al., 2009), but such data 
93 
can only be obtained with non-standard procedures such as microfluidics from patients’ 
94 
material (Eduati et al., 2020). To address this limitation, we developed a methodology to use 
95 
different omics data that are more commonly available to personalise generic models to 
96 
individual cancer patients or cell lines and verified that the obtained models correlated with 
97 
clinical results such as patient survival information (Béal et al., 2019). In the present work, 
98 
we apply this approach to prostate cancer to suggest targeted therapy to patients based on 
99 
their omics profile (Figure 1). We first built 488 patient- and eight cell line-prostate-specific 
100 
models using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genomics of Drug 
101 
Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) projects, respectively. Simulating these models with the 
102 
MaBoSS framework, we identified points of intervention that diminish the probability of 
103 
reaching pro-tumorigenic phenotypes. Lastly, we developed a new methodology to simulate 
104 
drug effects on these data-tailored Boolean models and present a list of viable drugs and 
105 
regimes that could be used on these patient- and cell-line-specific models for optimal results. 
106 
Experimental validations were performed on the LNCaP prostate cell line with two predicted 
107 
targets, confirming the predictions of the model. 
108 
Results 
109 
Prostate Boolean model construction 
110 
A network of signalling pathways and genes relevant for prostate cancer progression was 
111 
assembled to recapitulate the potential deregulations that lead to high-grade tumours. 
112 
Dynamical properties were added onto this network to perform simulations, uncover 
113 
therapeutic targets and explore drug combinations. The model was built upon a generic 
114 
cancer Boolean model by Fumiã and Martins (2013), which integrates major signalling 
115 
pathways and their substantial cross-talks. The pathways include the regulation of cell death 
116 
and proliferation in many tumours.  
117 
This initial generic network was extended to include prostate-cancer-specific genes (e.g., 
118 
SPOP, AR, etc.), pathways identified using ROMA (Martignetti et al., 2016), OmniPath (Türei 
119 
et al., 2021) and up-to-date literature. ROMA is applied on omics data, either transcriptomics 
120 
or proteomics. In each pathway, the genes that contribute the most to the overdispersion are 
121 
selected. ROMA was applied to the TCGA transcriptomics data using gene sets from cancer 
122 
pathway databases (Appendix 1, Section 1.1.3, Appendix figure 1). These results were used 
123 
as guidelines to extend the network to fully cover the alterations found in prostate cancer 
124 
patients. OmniPath was used to complete our network finding connections between the 
125 
proteins of interest known to play a role in the prostate and the ones identified with ROMA, 
126 
and the list of genes already present in the model (Appendix 1, Sections 1.1.3 and 1.1.4, 
127 
Appendix figures 2 and 3). The final network includes pathways such as androgen receptor, 
128 
MAPK, Wnt, NFkB, PI3K/AKT, MAPK, mTOR, SHH, the cell cycle, the epithelial-
129 
mesenchymal transition (EMT), apoptosis and DNA damage pathways. 
130 
This network was then converted into a Boolean model where all variables can take two 
131 
values: 0 (inactivate or absent) or 1 (activate or present). Our model aims at predicting 
132 
prostate phenotypic behaviours for healthy and cancer cells in different conditions. Nine 
133 
inputs that represent some of these physiological conditions of interest were considered: 
134 
Epithelial Growth Factor (EGF), Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF), Transforming Growth 
135 
Factor beta (TGFbeta), Nutrients, Hypoxia, Acidosis, Androgen, Tumour Necrosis Factor 
136 
alpha (TNF alpha) and Carcinogen. These input nodes have no regulation. Their value is 
137 
fixed 
according to the simulated experiment to represent the status of the 
138 
microenvironmental characteristics (e.g., the presence or absence of growth factors, oxygen, 
139 
etc.). A more complex multiscale approach would be required to consider the dynamical 
140 
interaction with other cell types. 
141 
We defined six variables as output nodes that allow the integration of multiple phenotypic 
142 
signals and simplify the analysis of the model. Two of these phenotypes represent the 
143 
possible growth status of the cell: Proliferation and Apoptosis. Apoptosis is activated by 
144 
Caspase 8 or Caspase 9, while Proliferation is activated by cyclins D and B (read-outs of the 
145 
G1 and M phases, respectively). The Proliferation output is described in published models 
146 
as specific stationary protein activation patterns, namely the following sequence of activation 
147 
of cyclins: Cyclin D, then Cyclin E, then Cyclin A, and finally Cyclin B (Traynard et al., 2016). 
148 
Here, we considered a proper sequence when Cyclin D activates first, allowing the release 
149 
of the transcriptional factor E2F1 from the inhibitory complex it was forming with RB 
150 
(retinoblastoma protein), and then triggering a series of events leading to the activation of 
151 
Cyclin B, responsible for the cell’s entry into mitosis (Appendix 1, Section 2.2, Appendix 
152 
figure 5). We also define several phenotypic outputs that are readouts of cancer hallmarks: 
153 
Invasion, Migration, (bone) Metastasis and DNA repair. The final model accounts for 133 
154 
nodes and 449 edges (Figure 2, Supplementary File 1, and in GINsim format at the address: 
155 
http://ginsim.org/model/signalling-prostate-cancer).  
156 
 
 
157 
Prostate Boolean model simulation 
158 
The model can be considered as a model of healthy prostate cells when no mutants (or 
159 
fused genes) are present. We refer to this model as the wild type model. These healthy cells 
160 
mostly exhibit quiescence (neither proliferation nor apoptosis) in the absence of any input 
161 
(Figure 3A). When Nutrients and growth factors (EGF or FGF) are present, Proliferation is 
162 
activated (Figure 3B). Androgen is necessary for AR activation and helps in the activation of 
163 
Proliferation, even though it is not necessary when Nutrients or growth factors are present. 
164 
Cell death factors (such as Caspase 8 or 9) trigger Apoptosis in the absence of SPOP, while 
165 
Hypoxia and Carcinogen facilitate apoptosis but are not necessary if cell death factors are 
166 
present (Figure 3C). 
167 
In our model, the progression towards metastasis is described as a stepwise process. 
168 
Invasion is first activated by known pro-invasive proteins: either β-catenin (Francis et al., 
169 
2013) or a combination of CDH2 (De Wever et al., 2004), SMAD (Daroqui et al., 2012) or 
170 
EZH2 (Ren et al., 2012). Migration is then activated by Invasion and EMT and with either 
171 
AKT or AR (Castoria et al., 2011). Lastly, (bone) Metastasis is activated by Migration and 
172 
one of three nodes: RUNX2 (Altieri et al., 2009), ERG (Adamo and Ladomery, 2016) or ERG 
173 
fused with TMPRSS2 (St John et al., 2012), FLI1, ETV1 or ETV4 (The Cancer Genome 
174 
Atlas Research Network, 2015). 
175 
This prostate Boolean model was simulated stochastically using MaBoSS (Stoll et al., 2017, 
176 
2012) and validated by recapitulating known phenotypes of prostate cells under 
177 
physiological conditions (Figure 3 and Appendix 1, Sections 2.2 and 2.3, Appendix figures 5-
178 
7). In particular, we tested that combinations of inputs lead to non-aberrant phenotypes such 
179 
as growth factors leading to apoptosis in wild type conditions; we also verified that the cell 
180 
cycle events occur in proper order: as CyclinD gets activated, RB1 is phosphorylated and 
181 
turned OFF, allowing E2F1 to mediate the synthesis of CyclinB (see Supplementary File 2 
182 
for the jupyter notebook and the simulation of diverse cellular conditions). 
183 
Personalisation of the prostate Boolean model  
184 
Personalised TCGA prostate cancer patient Boolean models 
185 
We tailored the generic prostate Boolean model to a set of 488 TCGA prostate cancer 
186 
patients (Appendix 1, Section 4, Appendix figure 9) using our personalisation method 
187 
(PROFILE, (Béal et al., 2019)), constructing 488 individual Boolean models, one for each 
188 
patient. Personalised models were built using three types of data: discrete data such as 
189 
mutations and copy number alterations (CNA) and continuous data such as RNAseq data. 
190 
For discrete data, the nodes corresponding to the mutations or the CNA were forced to 0 or 
191 
1 according to the effect of alterations, based on a priori knowledge (i.e., if the mutation was 
192 
reported to be activating or inhibiting the gene’s activity). For continuous data, the 
193 
personalisation method modifies the value for the transition rates of model variables and 
194 
their initial conditions to influence the probability of some transitions. This corresponds, in a 
195 
biologically-meaningful way, to translating genetic mutations as lasting modifications making 
196 
the gene independent of regulation, and to translating RNA expression levels as modulation 
197 
of a signal but not changing the regulation rules (see Materials and Methods and in 
198 
Appendix 1, Section 4.1, Appendix figure 10-14).  
199 
We assess the general behaviour of the individual patient-specific models by comparing the 
200 
model outputs (i.e., probabilities to reach certain phenotypes) with clinical data. Here, the 
201 
clinical data consist of a Gleason grade score associated with each patient, which in turn 
202 
corresponds to the gravity of the tumour based on its appearance and the stage of invasion 
203 
(Chen and Zhou, 2016; Gleason, 1992, 1977). We gathered output probabilities for all 
204 
patient-specific models and confronted them to their Gleason scores. The phenotype 
205 
DNA_repair, which can be interpreted as a sensor of DNA damage and genome integrity 
206 
which could lead to DNA repair, seems to separate low and high Gleason scores (Figure 4A 
207 
and Appendix 1, Section 4.1, Appendix figures 15-18), confirming that DNA damage 
208 
pathways are activated in patients (Marshall et al., 2019) but may not lead to the triggering of 
209 
apoptosis in this model (Appendix 1, Section 4.1, Appendix figure 11). Also, the centroids of 
210 
Gleason grades tend to move following Proliferation, Migration and Invasion variables. We 
211 
then looked at the profiles of the phenotype scores across patients and their Gleason grade 
212 
and found that the density of high Proliferation score (close to 1, Figure 4B) tends to 
213 
increase as the Gleason score increases (from low to intermediate to high) and these 
214 
distributions are significantly different (Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test, p-value=0.00207; 
215 
Appendix 1, Section 4.1). The Apoptosis phenotype, however, does not have a clear trend 
216 
across grades’ probabilities (Figure 4C), even though the distributions are significantly 
217 
different (Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test, p-value=2.83E-6; Appendix 1, Section 4.1).  
218 
Personalised drug predictions of TCGA Boolean models 
219 
Using the 488 TCGA-patient-specific models, we looked in each patient for genes that, when 
220 
inhibited, hamper Proliferation or promote Apoptosis in the model. We focused on these 
221 
inhibitions as most drugs interfere with the protein activity related to these genes, even 
222 
though our methodology allows us to study increased protein activity related to over-
223 
expression of genes as well (Béal et al., 2019; Montagud et al., 2017). Interestingly, we 
224 
found several genes that were found as suitable points of intervention in most of the patients 
225 
(MYC_MAX complex and SPOP were identified in more than 80% of the cases) (Appendix 1, 
226 
Section 4.2, Appendix figure 19 and 20), but others were specific to only some of the 
227 
patients (MXI1 was identified in only 4 patients, 1% of the total, GLI in only 7% and WNT in 
228 
8% of patients). All the TCGA-specific personalised models can be found in Supplementary 
229 
File 3, and the TCGA mutants and their phenotype scores can be found in Supplementary 
230 
File 4.  
231 
Furthermore, we explored the possibility of finding combinations of treatments that could 
232 
reduce the Proliferation phenotype or increase the Apoptosis one. To lower the 
233 
computational power need, we narrowed down the list of potential candidates to a set of 
234 
selected genes that are targets of already-developed drugs relevant in cancer progression 
235 
(Table 1) and analysed the simulations of the models with all the single and combined 
236 
perturbations.  
237 
We used the models to grade the effect that the combined treatments have in each one of 
238 
the 488 TCGA-patient-specific models’ phenotypes. This list of combinations of treatments 
239 
can be used to compare the effects of drugs on each TCGA patient and allows us to propose 
240 
some of them for individual patients and to suggest drugs suitable to groups of patients 
241 
(Supplementary File 4). Indeed, the inactivation of some of the targeted genes had a greater 
242 
effect in some patients than in others, suggesting the possibility for the design of 
243 
personalised drug treatments. For instance, for the TCGA-EJ-5527 patient, the use of 
244 
MYC_MAX complex inhibitor reduced Proliferation to 66%. For this patient, combining 
245 
MYC_MAX with other inhibitors, such as AR or AKT, did not further reduce the Proliferation 
246 
score (67% in these cases). Other patients have MYC_MAX as an interesting drug target, 
247 
but the inhibition of this complex did not have such a dramatic effect on their Proliferation 
248 
scores as in the case of TCGA-EJ-5527. Likewise, for the TCGA-H9-A6BX patient, the use 
249 
of SPOP inhibitor increased Apoptosis by 87%, while the use of a combination of cFLAR and 
250 
SPOP inhibitors further increased Apoptosis by 89%. For the rest of this section, we focus 
251 
on the analysis of clinical groups rather than individuals.  
252 
Studying the decrease of Proliferation, we found that AKT is the top hit in Gleason Grades 1, 
253 
2, 3, and 4, seconded by EGFR and SPOP in Grade 1, by SPOP and PIP3 in Grade 2, by 
254 
PIP3 and AR in Grade 3, and by CyclinD and MYC_MAX in Grade 4. MYC_MAX is the top 
255 
hit in Grade 5, seconded by AR (Appendix 1, Section 4.2, Appendix figure 19). In regards to 
256 
the increase of Apoptosis, SPOP is the top hit in all grades, seconded by SSH in Grades 1, 2 
257 
and 3 and by AKT in Grade 4 (Appendix 1, Section 4.2, Appendix figure 20). It is interesting 
258 
to note here that many of these genes are targeted by drugs (Table 1). Notably, AR is the 
259 
target of the drug Enzalutamide, which is indicated for men with an advanced stage of the 
260 
disease (Scott, 2018), or that MYC is the target of BET bromodomain inhibitors and are 
261 
generally effective in castration-resistant prostate cancer cases (Coleman et al., 2019). 
262 
The work on patient data provided some possible insights and suggested patient- and grade-
263 
specific potential targets. To validate our approach experimentally, we personalised the 
264 
prostate model to different prostate cell lines, where we performed drug assays to confirm 
265 
the predictions of the model. 
266 
Personalised drug predictions of LNCaP Boolean model 
267 
We applied the methodology for personalisation of the prostate model to eight prostate cell 
268 
lines available in GDSC (Iorio et al, 2016): 22RV1, BPH-1, DU-145, NCI-H660, PC-3, PWR-
269 
1E and VCaP (results in Appendix File, Section 5 and are publicly available in 
270 
Supplementary File 5). We decided to focus the validation on one cell line, LNCaP. 
271 
LNCaP, first isolated from a human metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma found in a lymph 
272 
node (Horoszewicz et al, 1983), is one of the most widely used cell lines for prostate cancer 
273 
studies. Androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells are representative of patients sensitive to 
274 
treatments as opposed to resistant cell lines such as DU-145. Additionally, LNCaP cells 
275 
have been used to obtain numerous subsequent derivatives with different characteristics 
276 
(Cunningham and You, 2015). 
277 
The LNCaP personalisation was performed based on mutations as discrete data and RNA-
278 
Seq as continuous data. The resulting LNCaP-specific Boolean model was then used to 
279 
identify all possible combinations of mutations (interpreted as effects of therapies) and to 
280 
study the synergy of these perturbations. For that purpose, we automatically performed 
281 
single and double mutant analyses on the LNCaP-specific model (knock-out and 
282 
overexpression) (Montagud et al., 2017) and focused on the model phenotype probabilities 
283 
as read-outs of the simulations. The analysis of the complete set of simulations for the 
284 
32258 mutants can be found in the Appendix 1, Section 6.1 and in Supplementary File 6, 
285 
where the LNCaP-cell-line-specific mutants and their phenotype scores are reported for all 
286 
mutants. Among all combinations, we identified the top 20 knock-out mutations that depleted 
287 
Proliferation or increased Apoptosis the most. As some of them overlapped, we ended up 
288 
with 29 nodes: AKT, AR, ATR, AXIN1, Bak, BIRC5, CDH2, cFLAR, CyclinB, CyclinD, E2F1, 
289 
eEF2K, eEF2, eEF2K, EGFR, ERK, HSPs, MED12, mTORC1, mTORC2, MYC, MYC_MAX, 
290 
PHDs, PI3K, PIP3, SPOP, TAK1, TWIST1, and VHL. We used the scores of these nodes to 
291 
further trim down the list to have 10 final nodes (AKT, AR, cFLAR, EGFR, ERK, HSPs, 
292 
MYC_MAX, SPOP and PI3K) and added 7 other nodes whose genes are considered 
293 
relevant in cancer biology, such as AR_ERG fusion, Caspase8, HIF1, GLUT1, MEK1_2, 
294 
p14ARF, ROS and TERT (Table 1). We did not consider the overexpression mutants as they 
295 
have a very difficult translation to drug uses and clinical practices. 
296 
To further analyse the mutant effects, we simulated the LNCaP model with increasing node 
297 
inhibition values to mimic the effect of drugs’ dosages using a methodology we specifically 
298 
developed 
for 
these 
purposes 
(PROFILE_v2 
and 
available 
at 
299 
https://github.com/ArnauMontagud/PROFILE_v2). Six simulations were done for each 
300 
inhibited node, with 100% of node activity (no inhibition), 80%, 60%, 40%, 20% and 0% (full 
301 
knock-out) (see Methods). A nutrient-rich media with EGF was used for these simulations, 
302 
and we show results on three additional sets of initial conditions in the Appendix 1, Section 
303 
6, Appendix figure 27: a nutrient-rich media with androgen, with androgen and EGF, and 
304 
with none, that correspond to experimental conditions that are tested here. We applied this 
305 
gradual inhibition, using increasing drugs’ concentrations, to a reduced list of drug-targeted 
306 
genes relevant for cancer progression (Table 1). We confirmed that the inhibition of different 
307 
nodes affected differently the probabilities of the outputs (Appendix 1, Section 7.3.1, 
308 
Appendix figures 34 and 35). Notably, the Apoptosis score was slightly promoted when 
309 
knocking out SPOP under all growth conditions (Appendix 1, Section 7.3.1, Appendix figure 
310 
35). Likewise, Proliferation depletion was accomplished when HSPs or MYC_MAX were 
311 
inhibited under all conditions and, less notably, when ERK, EGFR, SPOP or PI3K were 
312 
inhibited (Appendix 1, Section 7.3.1, Appendix figure 35). 
313 
Additionally, these gradual inhibition analyses can be combined to study the interaction of 
314 
two simultaneously inhibiting nodes (Appendix 1, Section 7.3.2, Appendix figure 36 and 37). 
315 
For instance, the combined gradual inhibition of ERK and MYC_MAX nodes affects the 
316 
Proliferation score in a balanced manner (Figure 5A) even though MYC_MAX seems to 
317 
affect this phenotype more, notably at low activity levels. By extracting subnetworks of 
318 
interaction around ERK and MYC_MAX and comparing them, we found that the pathways 
319 
they belong to have complementary downstream targets participating in cell proliferation 
320 
through targets in MAPK and cell cycle pathways. This complementarity could explain the 
321 
synergistic effects observed (Figure 5A and 5C). 
322 
Lastly, drug synergies can be studied using Bliss Independence using the results from single 
323 
and combined simulations with gradual inhibitions. This score compares the combined effect 
324 
of two drugs with the effect of each one of them, with a synergy when the value of this score 
325 
is lower than 1. We found that the combined inhibition of ERK and MYC_MAX nodes on the 
326 
Proliferation score was synergistic (Figure 5C). Another synergistic pair is the combined 
327 
gradual inhibition of HSPs and PI3K nodes that also affects the Proliferation score in a joint 
328 
manner (Figure 5B), with some Bliss Independence synergy found (Figure 5D). A complete 
329 
study on the Bliss Independence synergy of all the drugs considered in the present work on 
330 
Proliferation and Apoptosis phenotypes can be found in Appendix 1, Section 7.3.2, Appendix 
331 
figures 38 and 39. 
332 
Experimental validation of predicted targets 
333 
Drugs associated with the proposed targets 
334 
To identify drugs that could act as potential inhibitors of the genes identified with the Boolean 
335 
model, we explored the drug-target associations in DrugBank (Wishart et al., 2018) and 
336 
ChEMBL (Gaulton et al., 2017). We found drugs that targeted almost all genes 
337 
corresponding to the nodes of interest in Table 1, except for cFLAR, p14ARF and SPOP. 
338 
However, we could not identify experimental cases where drugs targeting both members of 
339 
the proposed combinations were available (Appendix 1, Section 7.1 and in Supplementary 
340 
File 6). One possible explanation is that the combinations predicted by the model suggest, in 
341 
some cases, to overexpress the potential target and most of the drugs available act as 
342 
inhibitors of their targets. 
343 
Using the cell-line specific models, we tested if the LNCaP cell line was more sensitive than 
344 
the rest of the prostate cell lines to the LNCaP-specific drugs identified in Table 1. We 
345 
compared GDSC’s Z-score of these drugs in LNCaP with their Z-scores in all GDSC cell 
346 
lines (Figure 6 and Appendix 1, Section 7.2, Appendix figure 33). We observed that LNCaP 
347 
is more sensitive to drugs targeting AKT or TERT than the rest of the studied prostate cell 
348 
lines. Furthermore, we saw that the drugs that targeted the genes included in the model 
349 
allowed the identification of cell line specificities (Appendix 1, Section 7.1). For instance, 
350 
target enrichment analysis showed that LNCaP cell lines are especially sensitive to drugs 
351 
targeting PI3K/AKT/mTOR, hormone-related (AR targeting) and Chromatin (bromodomain 
352 
inhibitors, regulating Myc) pathways (adjusted p-values from target enrichment: 0.001, 0.001 
353 
and 0.032, respectively, Appendix 1, Section 7.1, Appendix table 2), which corresponds to 
354 
the model predictions (Table 1). Also, the LNCaP cell line is more sensitive to drugs 
355 
targeting model-identified nodes than to drugs targeting other proteins (Appendix 1, Section 
356 
7.1, Appendix figure 32, Mann-Whitney p-value 0.00041), and this effect is specific for 
357 
LNCaP cell line (Mann-Whitney p-values ranging from 0.0033 to 0.38 for other prostate 
358 
cancer cell lines). 
359 
Overall, the drugs proposed through this analysis suggest the possibility to repurpose drugs 
360 
that are used in treating other forms of cancer for prostate cancer and open the avenue for 
361 
further experimental validations based on these suggestions. 
362 
Experimental validation of drugs in LNCaP  
363 
To validate the model predictions of the candidate drugs, we selected four drugs that target 
364 
HSPs and PI3K and tested them in LNCaP cell line experiments by using endpoint cell 
365 
viability measurement assays and real-time cell survival assays using the xCELLigence 
366 
system (see Methods). The drug selection was a compromise between the drugs identified 
367 
by our analyses (Table 1) and their effect in diminishing LNCaP’s proliferation (see the 
368 
previous section). In both assays, drugs that target HSP90AA1 and PI3K/AKT pathway 
369 
genes retrieved from the model analyses were found to be effective against cell proliferation. 
370 
The Hsp90 chaperone is expressed abundantly and plays a crucial role in the correct folding 
371 
of a wide variety of proteins such as protein kinases and steroid hormone receptors (Schopf 
372 
et al., 2017). Hsp90 can act as a protector of less stable proteins produced by DNA 
373 
mutations in cancer cells (Barrott and Haystead, 2013; Hessenkemper and Baniahmad, 
374 
2013). Currently, Hsp90 inhibitors are in clinical trials for multiple indications in cancer (Chen 
375 
et al., 2019; Iwai et al., 2012; Le et al., 2017). The PI3K/AKT signalling pathway controls 
376 
many different cellular processes such as cell growth, motility, proliferation, and apoptosis 
377 
and is frequently altered in different cancer cells (Carceles-Cordon et al., 2020; Shorning et 
378 
al., 2020). Many PI3K/AKT inhibitors are in different stages of clinical development, and 
379 
some of them are approved for clinical use (Table 1). 
380 
Notably, Hsp90 (NMS-E973,17-DMAG) and PI3K/AKT pathway (PI-103, Pictilisib) inhibitors 
381 
showed a dose-dependent activity in the endpoint cell viability assay determined by the 
382 
fluorescent resazurin after a 48-hour incubation (Figure 7). This dose-dependent activity is 
383 
more notable in Hsp90 drugs (NMS-E973,17-DMAG) than in PI3K/AKT pathway (Pictilisib) 
384 
ones and very modest for PI-103. 
385 
We studied the real-time response of LNCaP cell viability upon drug addition and saw that 
386 
the LNCaP cell line is sensitive to Hsp90 and PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitors (Figure 8 and 9, 
387 
respectively). Both Hsp90 inhibitors tested, 17-DMAG and NMS-E973, reduced the cell 
388 
viability 12 hours after drug supplementation (Figure 8A for 17-DMAG and Figure 8B for 
389 
NMS-E973), with 17-DMAG having a stronger effect and in a more clear concentration-
390 
dependent manner than NMS-E973 (Appendix 1, Section 8, Appendix figure 40, panels B-D 
391 
for 17-DMAG and panels F-H for NMS-E973). 
392 
Likewise, both PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitors tested, Pictilisib and PI-103, reduced the cell 
393 
viability immediately after drug supplementation (Figure 9A for Pictilisib and Figure 9B for PI-
394 
103), in a concentration-dependent manner (Appendix 1, Section 8, Appendix figure 41, 
395 
panels B-D for Pictilisib and panels F-H for PI-103). In addition, Hsp90 inhibitors had a more 
396 
prolonged effect on the cells’ proliferation than PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitors. 
397 
Discussion 
398 
Clinical assessment of cancers is moving towards more precise, personalised treatments, as 
399 
the times of one-size-fits-all treatments are no longer appropriate, and patient-tailored 
400 
models could boost the success rate of these treatments in clinical practice. In this study, we 
401 
set out to develop a methodology to investigate drug treatments using personalised Boolean 
402 
models. Our approach consists of building a model that represents the patient-specific 
403 
disease status and retrieving a list of proposed interventions that affect this disease status, 
404 
notably by reducing its pro-cancerous behaviours. In this work, we have showcased this 
405 
methodology by applying it to TCGA prostate cancer patients and to GDSC prostate cancer 
406 
cell lines, finding patient- and cell-line-specific targets and validating selected cell-line-
407 
specific predicted targets (Figure 1). 
408 
First, a prostate cancer Boolean model that encompasses relevant signalling pathways in 
409 
cancer was constructed based on already published models, experimental data analyses 
410 
and pathway databases (Figure 2). The influence network and the assignment of logical 
411 
rules for each node of this network were obtained from known interactions described in the 
412 
literature (Figure 3). This model describes the regulation of invasion, migration, cell cycle, 
413 
apoptosis, androgen and growth factors signalling in prostate cancer (Appendix File, Section 
414 
1). 
415 
Second, from this generic Boolean model, we constructed personalised models using the 
416 
different datasets, i.e. 488 patients from TCGA and eight cell lines from GDSC. We obtained 
417 
Gleason-score-specific behaviours for TCGA’s patients when studying their Proliferation and 
418 
Apoptosis scores, observing that high Proliferation scores are higher in high Gleason grades 
419 
(Figure 4). Thus, the use of these personalised models can help rationalise the relationship 
420 
of Gleason grading with some of these phenotypes.  
421 
Likewise, GDSC data was used with the prostate model to obtain prostate-specific cell-line 
422 
models (Figure 6). These models show differential behaviours, notably in terms of Invasion 
423 
and Proliferation phenotypes (Appendix 1, Section 5, Appendix figure 21). One of these cell-
424 
line-specific models, LNCaP, was chosen, and the effects of all its genetic perturbations 
425 
were thoroughly studied. We studied 32258 mutants, including single and double mutants, 
426 
knock-out and over-expressed, and their phenotypes (Appendix 1, Section 6.1, Appendix 
427 
figures 28 and 29). 32 knock-out perturbations that depleted Proliferation and/or increased 
428 
Apoptosis were identified, and 16 of them were selected for further analyses (Table 1). The 
429 
LNCaP-specific model was simulated using different initial conditions that capture different 
430 
growth media’s specificities, such as RPMI media with and without androgen or epidermal 
431 
growth factor (Appendix 1, Section 6, Appendix figure 27). 
432 
Third, these personalised models were used to simulate the inhibition of druggable genes 
433 
and proteins, uncovering new treatment’s combination and their synergies. We developed a 
434 
methodology to simulate drug inhibitions in Boolean models, termed PROFILE_v2, as an 
435 
extension of previous works (Béal et al., 2019). The LNCaP-specific model was used to 
436 
obtain simulations with nodes and pairs of nodes corresponding to the genes of interest 
437 
inhibited with varying strengths. This study allowed us to compile a list of potential targets 
438 
(Table 1) and to identify potential synergies among genes in the model (Figure 5). Some of 
439 
the drugs that targeted these genes, such as AKT and TERT, were identified in GDSC as 
440 
having more sensitivity in LNCaP than in the rest of the prostate cancer cell lines (Figure 6). 
441 
In addition, drugs that targeted genes included in the model allowed the identification of cell 
442 
line specificities (Appendix 1, Section 5). 
443 
Fourth, we validated the effect of Hsp90 and PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitors on the LNCaP cell 
444 
line experimentally, finding a concentration-dependent inhibition of the cell line viability as 
445 
predicted, confirming the role of the drugs targeting these proteins in reducing LNCaP’s 
446 
proliferation (Figure 7 and 8). Notably, these targets have been studied in other works on 
447 
prostate cancer (Chen et al., 2019; Le et al., 2017). 
448 
The study presented here enables the study of drug combinations and their synergies. One 
449 
reason for searching for combinations of drugs is that these have been described for 
450 
allowing the use of lower doses of each of the two drugs reducing their toxicity (Bayat 
451 
Mokhtari et al., 2017), evading compensatory mechanisms and combating drug resistances 
452 
(Al-Lazikani et al., 2012; Krzyszczyk et al., 2018).  
453 
Even if this approach is attractive and promising, it has some limitations. The scope of 
454 
present work is to test this methodology on a prostate model and infer patient-specific 
455 
prostate cancer treatments. The method need to be adapted if it were to be expanded to 
456 
study other cancers by using other models and target lists. The analyses performed with the 
457 
mathematical model do not aim to predict drug dosages per se but to help in the 
458 
identification of potential candidates. The patient-specific changes in Proliferation and 
459 
Apoptosis scores upon mutation are maximal theoretical yields that are used to rank the 
460 
different potential treatments and should not be used as a direct target for experimental 
461 
results or clinical trials. Our methodology suggests treatments for individual patients, but the 
462 
obtained results vary greatly from patient to patient, which is not an uncommon issue of 
463 
personalised medicine (Ciccarese et al., 2017; Molinari et al., 2018). This variability is an 
464 
economic challenge for labs and companies to pursue true patient-specific treatments and 
465 
also poses challenges in clinical trial designs aimed at validating the model based on the 
466 
selection of treatments (Cunanan et al., 2017). Nowadays, and because of these constraints, 
467 
it might be more commercially interesting to target group-specific treatments, which can be 
468 
more easily related to clinical stages of the disease. 
469 
Mathematical modelling of patient profiles helps to classify them in groups with differential 
470 
characteristics, providing, in essence, a grade-specific treatment. We, therefore, based our 
471 
analysis on clinical grouping defined by the Gleason grades, but some works have 
472 
emphasised the difficulty to properly assess them (Chen and Zhou, 2016) and, as a result, 
473 
may not be the perfect predictor for the patient subgrouping in this analysis, even though it is 
474 
the only available one for these datasets. The lack of subgrouping that stratifies patients 
475 
adequately may undermine the analysis of our results and could explain the Proliferation and 
476 
Apoptosis scores of high-grade and low-grade Gleason patients. 
477 
Moreover, the behaviours observed in the simulations of the cell-lines-specific models do not 
478 
always correspond to what is reported in the literature. The differences between simulation 
479 
results and biological characteristics could be addressed in further studies by including other 
480 
pathways, for example, better describing the DNA repair mechanisms, or by tailoring the 
481 
model with different sets of data, as the data used to personalise these models do not allow 
482 
for clustering these cell lines according to their different characteristics (Appendix 1, Section 
483 
5, Appendix figure 24 and 25). In this sense, another limitation is that we use static data (or a 
484 
snapshot of dynamic data) to build dynamic models and to study its stochastic results. Thus, 
485 
these personalised models would likely improve their performance if they were fitted to 
486 
dynamic data (Saez-Rodriguez and Blüthgen, 2020) or quantitative versions of the models 
487 
were built, such as ODE-based, that may capture more fine differences among cell lines. As 
488 
perspectives, we are working on integrating these models in multiscale models to study the 
489 
effect of the tumour microenvironment (Ponce-de-Leon et al., 2021, 2022), on including 
490 
information to simulate multiple reagents targeting a single node of the model, on scaling 
491 
these multiscale models to exascale high-performance computing clusters (Montagud et al., 
492 
2021; Saxena et al., 2021), and on streamlining these studies using workflows in computing 
493 
clusters to fasten the processing of new, bigger cohorts, as in the PerMedCoE project 
494 
(https://permedcoe.eu/).    
495 
The present work contributes to efforts aimed at using modelling (Eduati et al., 2020; Rivas-
496 
Barragan et al., 2020; Gómez Tejeda Zañudo et al., 2017) and other computational methods 
497 
(Madani Tonekaboni et al., 2018; Menden et al., 2019) for the discovery of novel drug 
498 
targets and combinatorial strategies. Our study expands the prostate drug catalogue and 
499 
improves predictions of the impact of these in clinical strategies for prostate cancer by 
500 
proposing and grading the effectiveness of a set of drugs that could be used off-label or 
501 
repurposed. The insights gained from this study present the potential of using personalised 
502 
models to obtain precise, personalised drug treatments for cancer patients. 
 
503 
Materials and Methods 
504 
Data acquisition 
505 
Publicly available data of 489 human prostate cancer patients from TCGA described in 
506 
(Hoadley et al., 2018) were used in the present work. We gathered mutations, CNA, RNA 
507 
and 
clinical 
data 
from 
cBioPortal 
508 
(https://www.cbioportal.org/study/summary?id=prad_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018) for all of 
509 
these samples resulting in 488 with complete omics datasets.  
510 
Publicly available data of cell lines used in the present work were obtained from the 
511 
Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer database (GDSC) (Iorio et al., 2016). Mutations, 
512 
CNA and RNA data, as well as cell lines descriptors, were downloaded from 
513 
(https://www.cancerrxgene.org/downloads). In this work, we have used 3- and 5-stage 
514 
Gleason grades. Their correspondence is the following: GG Low is GG 1, GG Intermediate is 
515 
GG 2 and 3, and GG High is GG 4 and 5. 
516 
All these data were used to personalise Boolean models using our PROFILE method (Béal 
517 
et al., 2019). 
518 
Prior knowledge network construction  
519 
Several sources were used in building this prostate Boolean model and, in particular, the 
520 
model published by Fumiã and Martins (2013). This model includes several signalling 
521 
pathways such as the ones involving receptor tyrosine kinase (RTKs), phosphatidylinositol 3-
522 
kinase (PI3K)/AKT, WNT/b-Catenin, transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b)/Smads, cyclins, 
523 
retinoblastoma protein (Rb), hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF-1), p53 and ataxia-
524 
telangiectasia mutated (ATM)/ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) protein kinases. 
525 
The model includes these pathways as well as the substantial cross-talks among them. For 
526 
a complete description of the process of construction, see Appendix 1, Section 1. 
527 
The model also includes several pathways that have a relevant role in our datasets identified 
528 
by ROMA (Martignetti et al., 2016), a software that uses the first principal component of a 
529 
PCA analysis to summarise the coexpression of a group of genes in the gene set, identifying 
530 
significantly overdispersed pathways with a relevant role in a given set of samples. This 
531 
software was applied to the TCGA transcriptomics data using the gene sets described in the 
532 
Atlas of Cancer Signaling Networks, ACSN (Kuperstein et al., 2015) (www.acsn.curie.fr) and 
533 
in Hallmarks (Liberzon et al., 2015) (Appendix 1, Section 1.1.3, Appendix figure 1) and 
534 
highlighted the signalling pathways that show high variance across all samples, suggesting 
535 
candidate pathways and genes. Additionally, OmniPath (Türei et al., 2021) was used to 
536 
extend the model and complete it, connecting the nodes from Fumiã and Martins and the 
537 
ones from ROMA analysis. OmniPath is a comprehensive collection of literature-curated 
538 
human signalling pathways, which includes several databases such as Signor (Perfetto et 
539 
al., 2016) or Reactome (Fabregat et al., 2016) and that can be queried using pypath, a 
540 
Python module for molecular networks and pathways analyses. 
541 
Fusion genes are frequently found in human prostate cancer and have been identified as a 
542 
specific subtype marker (The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2015). The most 
543 
frequent is TMPRSS2:ERG, as it involves the transcription factor ERG, which leads to cell-
544 
cycle progression. ERG fuses with the AR-regulated TMPRSS2 gene promoter to form an 
545 
oncogenic fusion gene that is especially common in hormone-refractory prostate cancer, 
546 
conferring androgen responsiveness to ERG. A literature search reveals that ERG directly 
547 
regulates EZH2, oncogene c-Myc and many other targets in prostate cancer (Kunderfranco 
548 
et al., 2010).  
549 
We modelled the gene fusion with activation of ERG by the decoupling of ERG in a special 
550 
node AR_ERG that is only activated by the AR when the fused_event input node is active. In 
551 
the healthy case, fused_event (that represents TMPRSS2:ERG fusion event) is fixed to 0 or 
552 
inactive. The occurrence of the gene fusion is represented with the model perturbation 
553 
where fused_event is fixed to 1. This AR_ERG node is further controlled by tumour 
554 
suppressor NKX3-1 that accelerates DNA_repair response, and avoids the gene fusion 
555 
TMPRSS2:ERG. Thus, loss of NKX3-1 favours recruitment to the ERG gene breakpoint of 
556 
proteins that promote error-prone non-homologous end-joining (Bowen et al., 2015). 
557 
The network was further documented using up-to-date literature and was constructed using 
558 
GINsim (Chaouiya et al., 2012), which allowed us to study its stable states and network 
559 
properties. 
560 
Boolean model construction 
561 
We converted the network to a Boolean model by defining a regulatory graph, where each 
562 
node is associated with discrete levels of activity (0 or 1). Each edge represents a regulatory 
563 
interaction between the source and target nodes and is labelled with a threshold and a sign 
564 
(positive or negative). The model is completed by logical rules (or functions), which assign a 
565 
target value to each node for each regulator level combination (Abou-Jaoudé et al., 2016; 
566 
Chaouiya et al., 2012). The regulatory graph was constructed using GINsim software 
567 
(Chaouiya et al., 2012) and then exported in a format readable by MaBoSS software (see 
568 
below) in order to perform stochastic simulations on the Boolean model. 
569 
The final model has a total of 133 nodes and 449 edges (Supplementary File 1) and includes 
570 
pathways such as androgen receptor and growth factor signalling, several signalling 
571 
pathways (Wnt, NFkB, PI3K/AKT, MAPK, mTOR, SHH), cell cycle, epithelial-mesenchymal 
572 
transition (EMT), Apoptosis, DNA damage, etc. This model has 9 inputs (EGF, FGF, TGF 
573 
beta, Nutrients, Hypoxia, Acidosis, Androgen, TNF alpha and Carcinogen presence) and 6 
574

586 
Stochastic Boolean model simulation 
587 
MaBoSS (Stoll et al., 2017, 2012) is a C++ software for stochastically simulating 
588 
continuous/discrete-time Markov processes defined on the state transition graph (STG) 
589 
describing the dynamics of a Boolean model (for more details, see (Abou-Jaoudé et al., 
590 
2016; Chaouiya et al., 2012)). MaBoSS associates transition rates to each node’s activation 
591 
and inhibition, enabling it to account for different time scales of the processes described by 
592 
the model. Probabilities to reach a phenotype (to have value ON) are thus computed by 
593 
simulating random walks on the probabilistic STG. Since a state in the STG can combine the 
594 
activation of several phenotypic variables, not all phenotype probabilities are mutually 
595 
exclusive (like the ones in Appendix 1, Section 6.1, Appendix figure 28). Using MaBoSS, we 
596 
can study an increase or decrease of a phenotype probability when the model variables are 
597 
altered (nodes status, initial conditions and transition rates), which may correspond to the 
598 
effect of particular genetic or environmental perturbation. In the present work, the outputs of 
599 
MaBoSS focused on the readouts of the model, but this can be done for any node of a 
600 
model. 
601 
MaBoSS applies Monte-Carlo kinetic algorithm (i.e. Gillespie algorithm) to the STG to 
602 
produce time trajectories (Stoll et al., 2017, 2012), so time evolution of probabilities are 
603 
estimated once a set of initial conditions are defined and a maximum time is set to ensure 
604 
that the simulations reach asymptotic solutions. Results are analysed in two ways: (1) the 
605 
trajectories for particular model states (states of nodes) can be interpreted as the evolution 
606 
of a cell population as a function of time, and (2) asymptotic solutions can be represented as 
607 
pie charts to illustrate the proportions of cells in particular model states. Stochastic 
608 
simulations with MaBoSS have already been successfully applied to study several Boolean 
609 
models (Calzone et al., 2010; Cohen et al., 2015; Remy et al., 2015). A description of the 
610 
methods we have used for the simulation of the model can be found in the Appendix 1, 
611 
Section 2. 
612 
Data tailoring the Boolean model 
613 
Logical models were tailored to a dataset using PROFILE to obtain personalised models that 
614 
capture the particularities of a set of patients (Béal et al., 2019) and cell lines (Béal et al., 
615 
2021). Proteomics, transcriptomics, mutations and CNA data can be used to modify different 
616 
variables of the MaBoSS framework, such as node activity status, transition rates and initial 
617 
conditions. The resulting ensemble of models is a set of personalised variants of the original 
618 
model that can show great phenotypic differences. Different recipes (use of a given data 
619 
type to modify a given MaBoSS variable) can be tested to find the combination that better 
620 
correlates to a given clinical or otherwise descriptive data.  
621 
In the present case, TCGA-patient-specific models were built using mutations, CNA and/or 
622 
RNA expression data. After studying the effect of these recipes in the clustering of patients 
623 
according to their Gleason grouping (Appendix 1, Section 4.1, Appendix figure 10-14), we 
624 
chose to use mutations and CNA as discrete data and RNA expression as continuous data. 
625 
Likewise, we tried different personalisation recipes to personalise the GDSC prostate cell 
626 
lines models, but as they had no associated clinical grouping features, we were left with the 
627 
comparison of the different values for the model’s outputs among the recipes (Appendix 1, 
628 
Section 5, Appendix figure 23). We used mutation data as discrete data and RNA expression 
629 
as continuous data as it included the most quantity of data and reproduced the desired 
630 
results (Appendix 1, Section 5, Appendix figure 23). We decided not to include CNA as 
631 
discrete data as it forced LNCAP proliferation to be zero by forcing the E2F1 node to be 0 
632 
and the SMAD node to be 1 throughout the simulation (for more details, refer to Appendix 1, 
633 
Section 5). 
634 
More on PROFILE’s methodology can be found in its own work (Béal et al., 2019) and at its 
635 
dedicated GitHub repository: https://github.com/sysbio-curie/PROFILE. A description of the 
636 
methods we have used for the personalisation of the models can be found in the Appendix 1, 
637 
Section 3. The analysis of the TCGA personalisations and their patient-specific drug 
638 
treatments can be found in Appendix 1, Section 4. The analysis of the prostate cell lines 
639 
personalisations can be found in Appendix 1, Section 5, with a special focus on the LNCaP 
640 
cell line model analysis in Section 6. 
641 
High-throughput mutant analysis of Boolean models 
642 
MaBoSS allows the study of knock-out or loss-of-function (node forced to 0) and gain-of-
643 
function (node forced to 1) mutants as genetic perturbations and of initial conditions as 
644 
environmental perturbations. Phenotypes’ stabilities against perturbations can be studied 
645 
and allow to determine driver mutations that promote phenotypic transitions (Montagud et 
646 
al., 2017). 
647 
Genetic interactions were thoroughly studied using our pipeline of computational methods for 
648 
Boolean 
modelling 
of 
biological 
networks 
(available 
at 
https://github.com/sysbio-
649 
curie/Logical_modelling_pipeline). LNCaP-specific Boolean model was used to perform 
650 
single and double knock-out (node forced to 0) and gain-of-function (node forced to 1) 
651 
mutants for each one of the 133 nodes, resulting in a total of 32258 models. These were 
652 
simulated under the same initial conditions, their phenotypic results were collected, and a 
653 
PCA was applied on the wild-type-centred matrix (Appendix 1, Section 6.1, Appendix figure 
654 
28 and 29). In addition, we found that the LNCaP model is very robust against perturbations 
655 
of its logical rules by systematically changing an AND for an OR gate or vice versa in all of 
656 
its logical rules (Appendix 1, Section 6.2, Appendix figure 30 and 31).  
657 
The 488 TCGA-patient-specific models were studied in a similar way, but only perturbing 16 
658 
nodes shortlisted for their therapeutic target potential (AKT, AR, Caspase8, cFLAR, EGFR, 
659 
ERK, GLUT1, HIF-1, HSPs, MEK1_2, MYC_MAX, p14ARF, PI3K, ROS, SPOP and TERT). 
660 
Then, the nodes that mostly contributed to a decrease of Proliferation (Appendix 1, Section 
661 
4.2, Appendix figure 19) or an increase in Apoptosis (Appendix 1, Section 4.2, Appendix 
662 
figure 20) were gathered from the 488 models perturbed. 
663 
Additionally, the results of the LNCaP model’s double mutants were used to quantify the 
664 
level of genetic interactions (epistasis or otherwise (Drees et al., 2005)) between two model 
665 
genetic perturbations (resulting from either the gain-of-function mutation of a gene or from its 
666 
knock-out or loss-of-function mutation) with respect to wild type phenotypes’ probabilities 
667 
(Calzone et al., 2015). The method was applied to the LNCaP model studying Proliferation 
668 
and Apoptosis scores (Appendix 1, Section 7.3.2, Appendix figure 34 and 35). 
669 
This genetic interaction study uses the following equation for each gene pair, which is 
670 
equation 2 in Calzone et al, (2015): 
671 
 
(1) 
672 
Where 
 and 
 are phenotype 
 fitness values of single gene defects, 
 is the 
673 
phenotype  fitness of the double mutant, and 
 is one of the four functions: 
674 
 (additive) 
675 
 (log) 
676 
 (multiplicative) 
677 
 
(min) (2) 
678 
To choose the best definition of 
, the Pearson correlation coefficient is computed 
679 
between the fitness values observed in all double mutants and estimated by the null model 
680 
(more information on (Drees et al., 2005)). Regarding 
 fitness value, to a given phenotype 
681 
, 
<1 represents deleterious, 
>1 beneficial and 
≈1 neutral mutation. 
682 
Drug simulations in Boolean models 
683 
Logical models can be used to simulate the effect of therapeutic interventions and predict 
684 
the expected efficacy of candidate drugs on different genetic and environmental 
685 
backgrounds by using our PROFILE_v2 methodology. MaBoSS can perform simulations 
686 
changing the proportion of activated and inhibited status of a given node. This can be 
687 
determined in the configuration file of each model (see, for instance, the “istate” section of 
688 
the CFG files in the Supplementary File 1, 3 and 5). For instance, out of 5000 trajectories of 
689 
the Gillespie algorithm, MaBoSS can simulate 70% of them with an activated AKT and 30% 
690 
with an inhibited AKT node. The phenotypes’ probabilities for the 5000 trajectories are 
691 
averaged, and these are considered to be representative of a model with a drug that inhibits 
692 
30% of the activity of AKT. The same applies for a combined drug inhibition: a simulation of 
693 
50% AKT activity and 50% PI3K will have 50% of them with an activated AKT and 50% with 
694 
an activated PI3K. Combining them, this will lead to 25% of the trajectories with both AKT 
695 
and PI3K active, 25% with both nodes inactive, 25% with AKT active and 25% with PI3K 
696 
active. 
697 
In the present work, the LNCaP model has been simulated with different levels of node 
698 
activity, with 100% of node activity (no inhibition), 80%, 60%, 40%, 20% and 0% (proper 
699 
knock-out), under four different initial conditions, a nutrient-rich media that simulates RPMI 
700 
Gibco® media with DHT (androgen), with EGF, with both and with none. In terms of the 
701 
model, the initial conditions are Nutrients is ON and Acidosis, Hypoxia, TGF beta, 
702 
Carcinogen and TNF alpha are set to OFF. EGF and Androgen values vary upon 
703 
simulations. We simulated the inhibition of 17 nodes of interest. These were the 16 nodes 
704 
from Table 1 with the addition of the fused AR-ERG (Appendix 1, Section 7.3.1, Appendix 
705 
figures 34 and 35) and their 136 pairwise combinations (Appendix 1, Section 7.3.2, Appendix 
706 
figures 36 and 37). As we used 6 different levels of activity for each node, the resulting 
707 
Appendix figures 36 and 37 comprise a total of 4998 simulations for each phenotype (136 x 
708 
6 x 6 + 17 x 6). 
709 
Drug synergies have been studied using Bliss Independence. The Combination Index was 
710 
calculated with the following equation (Foucquier and Guedj, 2015): 
711 
 
(3) 
712 
Where 
 and 
 is the efficiency of the single drug inhibitions and 
 is the inhibition 
713 
resulting from the double drug simulations. A Combination Index (CI) below 1 represents 
714 
synergy among drugs (Appendix 1, Section 7.3.2, Appendix figures 36 and 37).

717 
Identification of drugs associated with proposed targets 
718 
To identify drugs that could act as potential inhibitors of the genes identified with our models 
719 
(Table 1), we explored the drug-target associations in DrugBank (Wishart et al., 2018). For 
720 
those genes with multiple drug-target links, only those drugs that are selective and known to 
721 
have relevance in various forms of cancer are considered here.  
722 
In addition to DrugBank searches, we also conducted exhaustive searches in ChEMBL 
723 
(Gaulton et al., 2017) (http://doi.org/10.6019/CHEMBL.database.23) to suggest potential 
724 
candidates for genes whose information is not well documented in Drug Bank. From the 
725 
large number of bioactivities extracted from ChEMBL, we filtered human data and 
726 
considered only those compounds whose bioactivities fall within a specific threshold 
727 
(IC50/Kd/ Ki<100 nM). 
728 
We performed a target set enrichment analysis using the fgsea method (Korotkevich et al., 
729 
2016) from the piano R package (Väremo et al., 2013). We targeted pathway information 
730 
from the GDSC1 and GDSC2 studies (Iorio et al., 2016) as target sets and performed the 
731 
enrichment analysis on the normalised drug sensitivity profile of the LNCaP cell line. We 
732 
normalised drug sensitivity across cell lines in the following way: cells were ranked from 
733 
most sensitive to least sensitive (using ln(IC50) as drug sensitivity metrics), and the rank 
734 
was divided by the number of cell lines tested with the given drug. Thus, the most sensitive 
735 
cell line has 0, while the most resistant cell line has 1 normalised sensitivity. This rank-based 
736 
metric made it possible to analyse all drug sensitivities for a given cell line without drug-
737 
specific confounding factors, like mean IC50 of a given drug, etc. (Appendix 1, Section 7.1 
738 
and 7.2). 
739 
Cell culture method 
740 
For the in vitro drug perturbation validations, we used the androgen-sensitive prostate 
741 
adenocarcinoma cell line LNCaP purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, 
742 
Manassas, WV, USA). ATCC found no Mycoplasma contamination and the cell line was 
743 
identified using STR profiling. Cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 culture media (Gibco, 
744 
Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) containing 4.5 g/L glucose, 10% foetal bovine 
745 
serum (FBS, Gibco), 1X GlutaMAX (Gibco), 1% PenStrep antibiotics (Penicillin G sodium 
746 
salt, and Streptomycin sulfate salt, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MI, USA). Cells were 
747 
maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 (Sanyo, Osaka, Japan). 
748 
Drugs used in the cell culture experiments 
749 
We tested two drugs targeted at Hsp90 and two targeted at PI3K complex. 17-DMAG is an 
750 
Hsp90 inhibitor with an IC50 of 62 nM in a cell-free assay (Pacey et al., 2011). NMS-E973 is 
751 
an Hsp90 inhibitor with DC50 of <10 nM for Hsp90 binding (Fogliatto et al., 2013). Pictilisib is 
752 
an inhibitor of PI3Kα/δ with IC50 of 3.3 nM in cell-free assays (Zhan et al., 2017). PI-103 is a 
753 
multi-targeted PI3K inhibitor for p110α/β/δ/γ with IC50 of 2 to 3 nM in cell-free assays and 
754 
less potent inhibitor to mTOR/DNA-PK with IC50 of 30 nM (Raynaud et al., 2009). All drugs 
755 
were obtained from commercial vendors and added to the growth media to have 
756 
concentrations of 2, 8, 32, 128 and 512 nM for NMS-E973 and 1, 5, 25, 125 and 625 nM for 
757 
the rest of the drugs in the endpoint cell viability and of 3.3, 10, 30 uM for all the drugs in the 
758 
RT-CES cytotoxicity assay. 
759 
Endpoint cell viability measurements 
760 
In vitro toxicity of the selected inhibitors was determined using the viability of LNCaP cells, 
761 
determined by the fluorescent resazurin (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) assay as described 
762 
previously (Szebeni et al., 2017). Briefly, the LNCaP cells (10000) were seeded into 96-well 
763 
plates (Corning Life Sciences, Tewksbury, MA, USA) in 100 μl RPMI media and incubated 
764 
overnight. Test compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich, 
765 
Germany), and cells were treated with an increasing concentration of test compounds: 2, 8, 
766 
32, 128 and 512 nM for NMS-E973 and 1, 5, 25, 125 and 625 nM for the rest of the drugs. 
767 
The highest applied DMSO content of the treated cells was 0.4%. Cell viability was 
768 
determined after 48 hours of incubation. Resazurin reagent (Sigma–Aldrich, Budapest, 
769 
Hungary) was added at a final concentration of 25 μg/mL. After 2 hours at 37°C 5%, CO2 
770 
(Sanyo) fluorescence (530 nm excitation/580 nm emission) was recorded on a multimode 
771 
microplate reader (Cytofluor4000, PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA, USA). Viability 
772 
was calculated with relation to blank wells containing media without cells and to wells with 
773 
untreated cells. Each treatment was repeated in 2 wells per plate during the experiments, 
774 
except for the PI-103 treatment with 1 nM in which only one well was used. 
775 
In these assays, a deviation of 10-15% for in vitro cellular assays is an acceptable variation 
776 
as it is a fluorescent assay that detects the cellular metabolic activity of living cells. Thus, in 
777 
our analyses, we consider changes above 1.00 to be the same value as the controls. 
778 
Real-time cell electronic sensing (RT-CES) cytotoxicity assay 
779 
A real-time cytotoxicity assay was performed as previously described (Ozsvári et al., 2010). 
780 
Briefly, RT-CES 96-well E-plate (BioTech Hungary, Budapest, Hungary) was coated with 
781 
gelatin solution (0.2% in PBS, phosphate buffer saline) for 20 min at 37 °C; then gelatin was 
782 
washed twice with PBS solution. Growth media (50 μL) was then gently dispensed into each 
783 
well of the 96-well E-plate for background readings by the RT-CES system prior to the 
784 
addition of 50 μL of the cell suspension containing 2x104 LNCaP cells. Plates were kept at 
785 
room temperature in a tissue culture hood for 30 min prior to insertion into the RT-CES 
786 
device in the incubator to allow cells to settle. Cell growth was monitored overnight by 
787 
measurements of electrical impedance every 15 min. The next day cells were co-treated with 
788 
different drugs with concentrations of 3.3, 10 and 30 μM. Treated and control wells were 
789 
dynamically monitored over 72 h by measurements of electrical impedance every 5 min. 
790 
Each treatment was repeated in 2 wells per plate during the experiments, except for the 3.3 
791 
μM ones in which only one well was used. Continuous recording of impedance in cells was 
792 
used as a measurement of the cell growth rate and reflected by the Cell Index value (Solly et 
793 
al., 2004).  
794 
Note that around hour 15, our RT-CES reader had a technical problem caused by a short 
795 
blackout in our laboratory and the reader detected a minor voltage fluctuation while the 
796 
uninterruptible power supply (UPS) was switched on. This caused differences that are 
797 
consistent across all samples and replicates: all wild type and drug reads decrease at that 
798 
time point, except Pictilisib that slightly increases. For the sake of transparency and as the 
799 
overall dynamic was not affected, we decided to not remove these readings.

Figure 1: Workflow to build patient-specific Boolean models and to uncover 
1311 
personalised drug treatments from present work. We gathered data from Fumiã and 
1312 
Martins (2013) Boolean model, Omnipath (Türei et al., 2021) and pathways identified with 
1313 
ROMA (Martignetti et al., 2016) on the TCGA data to build a prostate-specific prior 
1314 
knowledge network. This network was manually converted into a prostate Boolean model 
1315 
that could be stochastically simulated using MaBoSS (Stoll et al., 2017) and tailored to 
1316 
different TCGA and GDSC datasets using our PROFILE tool to have personalised Boolean 
1317 
models. Then, we studied all the possible single and double mutants on these tailored 
1318 
models using our logical pipeline of tools (Montagud et al., 2017). Using these personalised 
1319 
models and our PROFILE_v2 tool presented in this work, we obtained tailored drug 
1320 
simulations and drug treatments for 488 TCGA patients and eight prostate cell lines. Lastly, 
1321 
we performed drug-dose experiments on a shortlist of candidate drugs that were particularly 
1322 
interesting in the LNCaP prostate cell line. Created with BioRender.com. 
1323 
Figure 2: Prostate Boolean model used in present work. Nodes (ellipses) represent 
1324 
biological entities, and arcs are positive (green) or negative (red) influences of one entity on 
1325 
another one. Orange rectangles correspond to inputs (from left to right: Epithelial Growth 
1326 
Factor (EGF), Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF), Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGFbeta), 
1327 
Nutrients, Hypoxia, Acidosis, Androgen, fused_event, Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha 
1328 
(TNFalpha), SPOP, Carcinogen) and dark blue rectangles to outputs that represent 
1329 
biological phenotypes (from left to right: Proliferation, Migration, Invasion, Metastasis, 
1330 
Apoptosis, DNA_repair), the read-outs of the model. This network is available to be 
1331 
inspected as a Cytoscape file in the Supplementary File 1. 
1332 
Figure 3: Prostate Boolean model MaBoSS simulations. (A) The model was simulated 
1333 
with all initial inputs set to 0 and all other variables random. All phenotypes are 0 at the end 
1334 
of the simulations, which should be understood as a quiescent state, where neither 
1335 
proliferation nor apoptosis is active. (B) The model was simulated with growth factors (EGF 
1336 
and FGF), Nutrients and Androgen ON. (C) The model was simulated with Carcinogen, 
1337 
Androgen, TNFalpha, Acidosis, and Hypoxia ON.

Figure 4: Associations between simulations and Gleason grades (GG). A) Centroids of 
1339 
the Principal Component Analysis of the samples according to their Gleason grades (GG). 
1340 
The personalisation recipe used was mutations and copy number alterations (CNA) as 
1341 
discrete data and RNAseq as continuous data. Density plots of Proliferation (B) and 
1342 
Apoptosis (C) scores according to GG; each vignette corresponds to a specific sub-cohort 
1343 
with a given GG. Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test across GG is significant for Proliferation (p-
1344 
value=0.00207) and Apoptosis (p-value=2.83E-6).

MYC_MAX (A and C) and HSPs and PI3K (B and D) inhibition under EGF growth 
1347 
condition. Proliferation score variation (A) and Bliss Independence synergy score (C) with 
1348 
increased node activation of nodes ERK and MYC_MAX. Proliferation score variation (B) 
1349 
and Bliss Independence synergy score (D) with increased node activation of nodes HSPs 
1350 
and PI3K. Bliss Independence synergy score < 1 is characteristic of drug synergy, grey 
1351 
colour means one of the drugs is absent, and thus no synergy score is available. 
1352 
Figure 6: Model-targeting drugs’ sensitivities across prostate cell lines. GDSC z-score 
1353 
was obtained for all the drugs targeting genes included in the model for all the prostate cell 
1354 
lines in GDSC. Negative values mean that the cell line is more sensitive to the drug. Drugs 
1355 
included in Table 1 were highlighted. "Other targets" are drugs targeting model-related 
1356 
genes that are not part of Table 1.

1363 
selected to capture their drug-dose response curves. The concentrations for the NMS-E973 
1364 
are different from the rest as this drug is more potent than the rest (see Material and 
1365 
methods).
