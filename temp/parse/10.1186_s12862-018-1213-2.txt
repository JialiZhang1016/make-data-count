Abstract
Background: The spatial distribution of genetic diversity and structure has important implications for conservation
as it reveals a species’ strong and weak points with regard to stability and evolutionary capacity. Temporal genetic
stability is rarely tested in marine species other than commercially important fishes, but is crucial for the utility of
temporal snapshots in conservation management. High and stable diversity can help to mitigate the predicted
northward range shift of seaweeds under the impact of climate change. Given the key ecological role of fucoid
seaweeds along rocky shores, the positive effect of genetic diversity may reach beyond the species level to stabilize
the entire intertidal ecosystem along the temperate North Atlantic. In this study, we estimated the effective
population size, as well as temporal changes in genetic structure and diversity of the seaweed F. serratus using 22
microsatellite markers. Samples were taken across latitudes and a range of temperature regimes at seven locations
with decadal sampling (2000 and 2010).
Results: Across latitudes, genetic structure and diversity remained stable over 5–10 generations. Stable small-scale
structure enhanced regional diversity throughout the species’ range. In accordance with its biogeographic history,
effective population size and diversity peaked in the species’ mid-range in Brittany (France), and declined towards
its leading and trailing edge to the north and south. At the species’ southern edge, multi-locus-heterozygosity
displayed a strong decline from 1999 to 2010.
Conclusion: Temporally stable genetic structure over small spatial scales is a potential driver for local adaptation
and species radiation in the genus Fucus. Survival and adaptation of the low-diversity leading edge of F. serratus
may be enhanced by regional gene flow and ‘surfing’ of favorable mutations or impaired by the accumulation of
deleterious mutations. Our results have clear implications for the conservation of F. serratus at its genetically unique
southern edge in Northwest Iberia, where increasing temperatures are likely the major cause for the decline not
only of F. serratus, but also other intertidal and subtidal macroalgae. We expect that F. serratus will disappear from
Northwest Iberia by 2100 if genetic rescue is not induced by the influx of genetic variation from Brittany.

Background
Understanding temporal stability of genetic structure
and diversity is crucial for the utility of temporal snap-
shots in conservation management and to infer how
climate-induced range shifts might affect the future dis-
tribution and adaptive potential of species. In trailing
edge populations, effective population size and genetic
diversity are considered major keys to adaptive potential
and subsequent persistence under climate change [1, 2].
In contrast, the evolutionary potential and survival of
low-diversity leading edge populations [3] may be either
enhanced or impaired by the ‘surfing’ of new mutations
that can rapidly increase in frequency over iterated
founder events, depending on whether the new muta-
tions are primarily favorable or deleterious [4–9].
Studies that assess temporal genetic stability are rare
in marine species, and mostly confined to fisheries man-
agement to ensure sustainable exploitation of economic-
ally important species [10–14]. While high gene flow
explained 5 to 24-year long stability in genetic variability
and structure in Chinook salmon and Atlantic herring
[10, 11], large fluctuations in allele frequencies were re-
corded over a few months in small and closed popula-
tions of the intertidal isopod Jaera albifrons [15].
However, high gene flow does not always warrant tem-
poral genetic stability, as several marine species with
long-lived planktonic larvae showed stronger temporal
than spatial differentiation over 3 to 9 years [16–18]. On
the other hand, low gene flow does not necessarily result
in genetic instability over time, although genetic drift in
small and closed populations can be expected to be high.
For example, genetic diversity and population structure
remained stable over 5–12 years in relatively closed pop-
ulations of the seagrass Zostera marina [19] and over
2 years in nine out of 10 locally differentiated popula-
tions of the isopod Excirolana braziliensis [20]. These
contrasting results demonstrate that a species’ life his-
tory alone does not necessarily predict its genetic stabil-
ity over time.
Due to their high sensitivity to rising temperatures, re-
sponses of marine intertidal species are considered as
early warning signals for the impact of climate change
[21–25]. Among global climate change factors, ocean
warming is considered the most severe threat for marine
macrophytes [26–28]. Over the next century, ecological
niche models predict the disappearance of intertidal fu-
coid brown algae along their southern trailing edges and
a poleward extension of their northern leading edges
[26, 29]. Fucoid brown algae (Heterokontophyta; Fuca-
ceae) are habitat-forming ecosystem engineers support-
ing species-rich intertidal communities along temperate
rocky shores [30–33]. Thus, range shifts of fucoids will
undoubtedly trigger major ecological changes along tem-
perate rocky shores of the North Atlantic.
Ecological niche models, however, do not consider the
species’ plastic and adaptive potential that could mitigate
the predicted northward shifts. Adaptive potential de-
pends largely on a population’s genetically effective size,
Ne [34], or the size of an ideal population that undergoes
the same rate of genetic change as the real population
[35]. At low Ne, and low gene flow between populations,
genetic drift generally plays the predominant role, effect-
ively neutralizing selection, and eroding genetic diversity
through stochastic fixation or loss of allelic variations
[36–38]. Although Ne and temporal stability of genetic
diversity patterns are particularly important for restor-
ation and conservation efforts of fucoid seaweeds, only a
single Norwegian population of F. serratus has so far
been assessed [39].
The canopy-forming seaweed F. serratus is an excel-
lent model for the study of temporal evolution and sta-
bility of genetic structure and diversity across a range of
contrasting temperature regimes. It is one of the domin-
ant intertidal seaweeds along the Northeast-Atlantic
rocky shore from northern Portugal to northern Norway
[40]. Arctic regions are predicted to become thermally
suitable through 2100 under CO2 emission scenario pro-
jections [26]. In contrast, regions south of the Brittany
coast of France are predicted to become unsuitable [26],
as temperatures will rise beyond the species’ potential
for thermal acclimatization [41]. The susceptibility of F.
serratus to climate change is expected to vary regionally,
given the species’ regional patterns of genetic diversity
[42], in combination with low gene flow between local
populations [43].
Genetic diversity of F. serratus is highest in the two
former, large glacial refugia (20–18 thousand years ago
(kya)) in Southwest Ireland, and Brittany [42, 43]. The
third refugium in the Northwest Iberian peninsula is
characterized by a high proportion of private alleles, and
currently represents the species’ isolated trailing edge,
where recurrent cycles of thermally induced extinction
and recolonization have eroded genetic diversity [42,
43]. Currently, sea surface temperatures reach 22 °C,
and although below the lethal limit of F. serratus (25 °C)
[40, 44], inhibit growth, physiological performance and
reproductive capacity [45–48].
Genetic diversity of F. serratus decreases from its
mid-range of distribution towards higher latitudes and is
lowest in leading edge populations in northern Norway
[42, 43]. Low genetic diversity in leading-edge popula-
tions is explained by the populations’ relatively young
age and their derivation from small founder populations
that carried only a subset of the genetic variation from
glacial refugia to the north after the ice retreated, ca.
15–10 kya.
While Ne is a good indicator for temporal genetic sta-
bility, its estimation relies on temporally-spaced genetic

data [49]. Due to this complication in sampling design,
Ne of F. serratus has been estimated in only a single
population close to Bergen (Norway) over eight years
[39]. The estimated Ne between 73 and 386 was regarded
insufficient for long-term survival under environmental
change [39]. However, a thorough appraisal of the spatial
distribution and temporal stability of Ne and genetic di-
versity throughout the species’ latitudinal range of distri-
bution cannot be inferred from a single location.
Estimating climate change susceptibility in a species
with low gamete/zygote dispersal requires to assess tem-
poral genetic stability across its latitudinal and thermal
range of distribution. In this study, we estimated Ne of F.
serratus across latitude and temperature at seven loca-
tions with decadal sampling (2000 and 2010), a period in
which Europe experienced three heat waves in 2003,
2006, and 2010 [50–52]. Here we evaluate whether range
shifts in the north or strong selection pressures in the
south have resulted in measurable changes in genetic di-
versity and population structure. In populations that are
dominated by genetic drift and with small adaptive po-
tential, we expected to find a decline in genetic diversity
over the past decade. Finally, we discuss whether genetic
diversity may be sufficiently stable to buffer environmen-
tal
change

mitigate

predictions.
Methods
Sampling
Individuals were sampled ca. ten years apart from the
same seven populations spanning the latitudinal distri-
bution of F. serratus (Fig. 1). Ethical approval is not re-
quired for research work with the seaweed/macroalga F.
serratus. Field collections did not require specific per-
mits and the species is neither endangered nor pro-
tected. Sampling involved removing a thumbnail-sized
piece of tissue from ca. 50 to 100 individuals at each
sampling site and did not threaten either the individual
or the local population. Live samples were never trans-
ferred to other countries or locations within any of the
countries. In all cases the specimens were collected
within the context of various grants (see funding infor-
mation) that involved at least one of the co-authors and
one or more colleagues from the country where the col-
lection was made.
Variability in daily average sea surface temperatures and
surface air temperatures at the sampling locations (Fig. 1,
Additional file 1), recorded from 1999 to 2011, were ex-
tracted from the NOAA/OI/SST/V2 dataset (0.25° reso-
lution,
described
in
[53])
and
the
CPC
Global
Temperature dataset (0.5° resolution) provided by NOAA/
OAR/ESRL/PSD, Boulder, Colorado, USA, [54]). Thermal
variability was replicated in the two Norwegian, the two
French, and the two Spanish samples, respectively. In
Denmark, only a single population was sampled at two
time points. Individual tissues were blotted dry and stored
in silica prior to transport for subsequent DNA extraction.
Microsatellite genotyping
DNA was extracted from 2 mg silica dried tissue accord-
ing to [55] with the modifications described in [56],
followed by a purification step with the OneStep-96 PCR
Inhibitor Removal Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, USA) and
a 1:3 dilution of the purified product. The samples were
genotyped for a total of 31 microsatellite markers: 11 an-
onymous loci (L20, L38, L58, and L94 described in [57];
B113, B128, E6, E9, D39, A198, and F4 described in
[58]) and 20 loci linked to expressed sequence tags
(ESTs: F12, F22, F34, F36, F60, F45, F50, F17, F72, F49,
F14, F21, F58, F19, F37, F65, F59, F69, F9, and described
in [56]) (Additional file 2).
Polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) with 5 μl total vol-
ume contained 1 μl purified DNA template, 1.34 μl
nuclease-free Water (Ambion, Thermo Fisher Scientific),
2.5 μl of AmpliTaq Gold 360 MM (Applied Biosystems,
Life Technologies) and 0.08 μl of each forward and reverse
primer (each primer at 20 μM; forward primer labeled
with 6FAM, NED, PET or VIC; Applied Biosystems, Life
Technologies). PCR was performed in a Veriti 96-Well
Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies).
The conditions are depicted in Additional file 3 and speci-
fied for each marker in Additional file 2.
The fragment lengths were determined on an ABI
3500xl Genetic Analyzer from 1 μl of diluted PCR prod-
ucts (specified for each marker in Additional file 2)
mixed with 8.9 μl of HiDi Formamide (Life Technolo-
gies) and 0.1 μl of Gene Scan 500 LIZ Size Standard
(Life Technologies) after 5 min denaturation at 95 °C.
Allele calling was performed with the GeneMapper v 4.1
Software (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Data analysis
The microsatellite raw dataset (Additional file 4) was
corrected for allelic dropout with a Maximum Likeli-
hood approach [59] using the program MicroDrop [60].
From the corrected data (Additional file 5), nine markers
E9, F14, F17, F36, F37, F59, F60, F65, and L20 were re-
moved from the full set of 31 markers before further
analyses with the remaining 22 markers because the pro-
portion of missing data for the excluded markers
exceeded 12% in at least one of the populations.
Diversity estimates
Average locus heterozygosity Hexp (bias-corrected [61]),
allelic richness α (the average number of alleles per locus)
and multi-locus heterozygosity (MLH), the number of het-
erozygous loci per individual divided by the number of
loci, were calculated for each sampling location. Regional

estimates were obtained after pooling the two spatial sam-
ples from each of the Norwegian, Spanish and French re-
gions. Regional estimates were not possible for the Danish
region because only one population was sampled. Hexp
was calculated with the R package ‘DEMEtics’ [62], and α
was estimated with the R package ‘PopGenReport’. For
local estimates, α was normalized to a sample size of 24,
the smallest number samples in a population. For regional
estimates α was normalized to a sample size of 24, and
additionally, to a sample size of 50. MLH was estimated
with the R package ‘InbreedR’. Inbreeding coefficients FIS
[63] were estimated with the R package ‘Demerelate’ and
tests for significant deviation from 0 were based on 1000
iterations. We tested for significant temporal changes of
Hexp, α, FIS, and MLH at each sampling location with Wil-
coxon rank sum tests in R [64]. To assess temporal evolu-
tion of diversity estimates, we tested for correlation
between current and historical local measures with a
Spearman’s rank correlation in R [64]. Additionally, we
tested
for
significant
differences
between
average
present-day and historical values using Wilcoxon Rank
Sum tests in R [64].
Effective population sizes (Ne) were estimated with an
assumed generation time of 2 years [65] with the R
package ‘NB’ after removing loci with only one allele:
Locus F9 for the Kirkenes population, locus F72 for the
Ribadeo1 population and loci F21 and F72 for the Riba-
deo2 population.

sites. Summer temperatures were exceptionally high at the Danish and Spanish sampling sites during the first two of three heat waves that
Europe experienced in years 2003, 2006, and 2010

Genetic differentiation
Population structure was determined with Bayesian clus-
tering methods implemented in the software STRUCTURE
v2.3.4 [66]. Acceptance of six clusters (K) was deter-
mined with the δ K Method [67] in the R package
‘pophelper’ [68].
Temporal genetic changes at each sampling location
and geographic genetic differentiation within and be-
tween all historical and recent samples were estimated
by the fixation index FST [69] using GENETIX 4.05 [70]
and the differentiation index Dest [71]) using the R pack-
age ‘DEMEtics’ 0.8–7 [62]. Dest more correctly measures
the true genetic differentiation compared with FST for
multi-allelic markers such as microsatellites [62, 71].
Statistical significance of the pairwise comparisons was
based on 10,000 permutations for FST and on 1000 Boot-
strap repeats for Dest. To assess temporal stability of geo-
graphic differentiation, we tested for correlation between
recent and historical FST and Dest values with Spear-
mans’s rank correlation in R [64]. Additionally, we tested
for significant differences between average present-day
and historical values using Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests in
R [64]. Finally, we tested for correlation between tem-
poral genetic differentiation (FST, Dest) and Ne with Pear-
son’s product moment correlation in R [64].
Results
Genetic structure
Bayesian clustering with the program STRUCTURE re-
vealed clear differences between regions but not with
time (Fig. 2). Historical and present-day FST values were
strongly positively correlated (r = 0.93, p < 0.00001), and
the overall historical FST value (0.21) did not differ sig-
nificantly (p = 0.567) from the present-day value (0.22),
indicating that spatial genetic differentiation between
populations was globally consistent over time (Fig. 3a).
Historical and present-day Dest values supported these
findings as the overall values (0.40 and 0.42, respectively)
did not differ significantly (p = 0.636) and were positively
correlated (r = 0.97, p < 0.00001, Fig. 3b). Isolation by
distance was indicated by stronger differentiation among
than within countries (Additional file 6).
Temporal changes, however, were noted on a local level.
Local differentiation between the Norwegian populations
decreased from 2004 to 2010 (Additional file 6). All but
the French population ‘Ile de Siec’ changed significantly in
genetic variation over time, as indicated by significant
changes in FST and Dest (Additional file 7). The Spanish
population ‘Ribadeo2’ showed significant temporal change
in FST but not in Dest.
Genetic variation/diversity
Stable population diversities through time were indicated
by significant correlations of historical and present-day
intra-population diversity indices (Fig. 4; Hexp: r = 0.86,
p = 0.02, MLH: r = 1, p = 0.0004; α: r = 0.96, p = 0.003; FIS:
r = 0.82, p = 0.03). Moreover, average present-day values
did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) from average histor-
ical values (Hexp: present = 0.56, historical = 0.56; MLH:
present = 0.61, historical = 0.62; α: present = 6.22, histor-
ical = 6.36; FIS: present = −0.10, historical = −0.10).
Local and regional diversity estimates (Additional file 8)
were highest in France and lower at the northern and
southern distribution edges (Fig. 4). Regional α estimates
(standardized to 50 samples) exceeded local estimates
(standardized to 24 samples) in all regions (Additional file 8).
Effective population size (Ne) was highest in the
French population ‘Ile de Siec’ (Ne = 10,000,000) and
lowest in the Norwegian population ‘Grense Jakobselv’
(Ne = 62) (Fig. 5, Additional file 7). Ne for the other pop-
ulations ranged from 700 to 200 in the order: Gjerild
Klint > Green Top > Ribadeo2 > Ribadeo1 > Kirkenes. At
both sampling time points, none of the diversity esti-
mates were significantly correlated with effective popula-
tion size (all p > 0.09). The temporal decrease in MLH in
Ribadeo2 was strong but not significant (p = 0.051, Add-
itional file 7). The FIS in ‘Kirkenes’ was significantly
negative (p = 0.043, Additional file 8).
Discussion
The spatial distribution of genetic diversity has im-
portant implications for conservation and manage-
ment as it reveals a species’ strong and weak points
with regards to stability and evolutionary capacity

[72–74]. Given the key ecological role of F. serratus
[30–32, 75–77], the positive effect of genetic diversity
may reach beyond the species level to affect commu-
nity structure and increase species richness and sta-
bility of the entire associated ecosystem [78–81]. We
are not aware of seaweed studies that have investi-
gated positive ecosystem effects of genetic diversity,
but genetic diversity enhanced heat-stress survival in
germlings of Fucus vesiculosus [27]. Furthermore, in
the habitat forming seagrass Z. marina, genotypic di-
versity not only enhanced biomass production, but
also
abundance
of
the
associated
fauna
under
near-lethal water temperatures [82] and community
resistance to grazing [83]. Thus, maintaining genetic
diversity in F. serratus is also expected to be import-
ant for conservation and management of the entire
intertidal ecosystem along temperate rocky shores.
Across the latitudinal range of F. serratus, genetic di-
versity and differentiation remained stable for 5–10
generations at regional scales, and in all but the Nor-
wegian region at local spatial scales (Figs. 2, 3, 4).
This suggests that, despite low gene flow between
populations, effective population sizes have remained
large enough to maintain genetic variation at least on
the short term. Temporal genetic differentiation was
systematically lower than local differentiation, and 1–
2 orders of magnitude lower than regional differenti-
ation (Additional file 9). This implies that temporal
snapshots provide valuable information for conserva-
tion management of fucoid seaweeds, as they reliably
reflect diversity and differentiation patterns for at
least a decade.
Ne comparisons
In all but the Norwegian populations, Ne was estimated
as > 260, a size reported as the median estimate for
stable populations in over 83 studies spanning a diverse
range of taxa [36]. This suggests low sensitivity to gen-
etic stochasticity [36] in all but the northern edge popu-
lations of F. serratus. As in most studies, the precision of
Ne decreased as Ne increased (Fig. 5) [36, 84, 85]. Local
differentiation in F. serratus is one of the most import-
ant assumptions of the employed ‘temporal’ method to
estimate Ne, in which neutral genetic change over time
is expected to be inversely proportional to Ne. Discrete
generations are another important assumption of the
‘temporal’ method. Overlapping generations are unlikely
to cause a significant downward bias of Ne when more
than 4 generations lie between the temporal samples
[49]. This can be expected for most of our temporal
samples, assuming a generation time of 1–2 years [65,
86] and a time span of 6–11 years between sampling.
Thus,
our
sample-size-corrected
estimates
can
be
regarded as unbiased and indicative of a ‘real’ decline in
Ne from the species’ mid-range of distribution to its
range-edges.
An Ne > 1000, as in the French ‘Ile de Siec’ population,
is large enough to ensure evolutionary potential in per-
petuity [87], and is likely to provide the best source for
adaptive genetic rescue of threatened and declining popu-
lations [38, 88]. However, large Ne estimates are com-
monly associated with a high uncertainty [36, 85].
Accordingly, the point estimate of Ne in the ‘Ile de Siec’
population (ca. 10 Million) has a wide confidence interval
as compared with the other populations (Fig. 5, Additional
file 7). Consequently, the point estimate is unlikely to be
the true value in this population, but is certainly > 1000,
and higher than in any other measured populations. The
reason for this outlier value is not due to high diversity,
since this is comparable to the other French population
(Fig. 4a-d), but the high stability in allele frequencies over
time. Indeed, the ‘Ile de Siec’ population was the only
population for which temporal genetic differentiation was
non-significant (Additional file 7).
Ne in the other mid-range populations, > 500, may be
sufficient in the mid-term [36, 87, 89] to mitigate the
predicted extinction by the end of the twenty-first cen-
tury [26]. However, given that summer temperatures are
predicted to rise above the thermal tolerance limit of F.
serratus in Brittany within the next 200 years [26, 41], it
is important to track its fitness in this region in order to
implement early conservation measures in case it loses
its current stability.
An Ne of 50–100 was regarded necessary for a popula-
tion to minimize inbreeding depression and associated
problems such as accumulation of deleterious mutations
and loss of variation [36, 87]. However, despite Ne < 60

in the Norwegian ‘Grense Jakobselv’ population, genetic
diversity remained stable for both Norwegian popula-
tions over six years and neither population was inbred.
In contrast, a previous study on a southern Norwegian
population reported significant loss of Ne from 2000 to
2008 and concluded that an Ne between 73 and 386 was
insufficient for long-term survival under environmental
change [39]. Stable diversity despite small Ne in our two
northern Norwegian populations may be ascribed to re-
gional gene flow, suggested by a reduction in genetic dif-
ferentiation between the two Norwegian populations
from 2004 to 2010 and significant outbreeding (negative
FIS) in the ‘Kirkenes’ population in 2010. Thus, regional
gene flow may uncouple Ne from genetic stochasticity
effects at the species’ Northern edge of distribution.
Diversity comparisons
As expected for neutral loci, genetic diversity was posi-
tively related with Ne [36, 38]. Both regional and local
diversities
are
highest
in
Brittany
and
make
the
range-center of F. serratus less sensitive to genetic drift
[36, 37]. A decline in genetic diversity towards the
northern and southern range-edges is in accordance
with the species’ biogeographic history [42].
Low genetic diversity does not necessarily lower the
evolutionary potential of F. serratus to adapt to Arctic
shores [26]. The evolutionary potential, survival, and ex-
pansion rate of low-diversity leading edge populations [3]
may decrease when deleterious mutations accumulate at
expansion range fronts and create a so-called ‘expansion
load’ [7, 9]. On the other hand, survival may well be en-
hanced by the ‘surfing’ of favorable mutations that can
rapidly increase in frequency over iterated founder events
[4, 5, 90]. An additional consideration is that source popu-
lations of Arctic colonists may not be located at the spe-
cies’ northern edge, but within European harbors with
frequent shipping, fishing, and cruise boat traffic to and
from the northern polar regions.
Our results have clear implications for the conservation
of F. serratus at its southern edge. Reductions in MLH
from 1999 to 2010 were close to significant (p = 0.0051/
0.134 for Ribadeo2/Ribadeo1, respectively), although, Hexp,
α, and FIS remained temporally stable. This agrees with sta-
bility of Hexp and α over 7–9 years in fragmented southern
edge populations of the kelp species Laminaria digitata
[91], and is likely due to the measures’ insensitivity to the
effects of population bottlenecks [92]. In other words,
while the polymorphic state of loci and the diversity of al-
leles did not decline, alleles occurred more frequently in a
homozygous state in the recent samples. In theory, the de-
cline in MLH might be explained by increased selection
pressure for heat-tolerance, although there is only indirect
experimental evidence for this. Acclimation potential to
further thermal stress is likely impeded in this population
by chronically high expression of heat shock protein genes
[22, 23, 41, 93]. Between 2000 and 2010, the Ribadeo1
population experienced a 90% decline in abundance [26].
Although stable local differentiation favors ecotypic differ-
entiation in thermal stress tolerance [41], heat-stress is be-
coming too extreme at the southern edge.
The value of conserving the southern edge of F. serratus
may be high [94]. Because of its separation from Brittany
by the uninhabitable sandy warm shores of the Bay of Bis-
cay, the Northwest Iberian glacial refugium did not con-
tribute to postglacial recolonizations of ice-free northern
shores, and, thus, preserves unique genetic variation [42].
The conservation value of the species’ southern edge be-
comes
even
more
apparent
when
considering
that
small-scale population structure increases the species’ re-
gional diversity above local diversity within single popula-
tions (Additional file 8). High regional diversity, despite
low within-population diversity, was previously reported
for the southern distribution edge of the seagrass Zostera
marina [94, 95]. We are not aware of studies that expli-
citly addressed this effect in macroalgae, although in-
creased local differentiation at the southern edge of the
kelp Laminaria digitata [91] can be expected to increase
regional variation as well. Thus, with the loss of its south-
ern edge, the species’ can be expected to lose its most
heat-adapted
populations
sustaining
unique
genetic
variation.
Conclusions
Temporal snapshots of genetic diversity and structure in
F. serratus populations spanning its latitudinal range re-
liably reflect patterns across local and regional spatial
scales and across various thermal backgrounds for at
least one decade. Stable small-scale structure enhances
regional genetic diversity throughout the species’ range
of distribution and is a potential driver for local adapta-
tion [36] that may explain species radiation and diversity
in the genus Fucus [96–98].
MLH appears to be the most stress-sensitive measure
of diversity, displaying a strong decline at the species’
southern edge of distribution. As sandy warm shores
separate the Iberian southern edge from the genetically
diverse Brittany region, genetic rescue by the influx of
genetic variation [38, 88] might only be possible if initi-
ated by conservation efforts.
Increasing temperatures are likely the major cause for
the decline not only of F. serratus, but also other inter-
tidal and subtidal macroalgae in Northwest Iberia [28,
99–101], as well as temperate seaweeds worldwide [102].
Kelp species may maintain genetic diversity to a certain
degree in southern edges by escaping to deep-water re-
fugia to avoid rising temperatures in shallow waters
[103]. Accordingly, in Northern Portugal, increasing
air-temperature stress depresses the upper boundary

limit of F. serratus [104]. However, intertidal seaweeds
are less adapted to low light conditions and, thus, have
low potential to escape into deeper waters. Another fac-
tor that impedes survival of southern edge populations
in fucoid seaweeds is their reproductive strategy with
fewer gametes and lower dispersal (< 12 m from parental
sites [45, 46]) as compared with kelps that release bil-
lions of spores dispersing several kilometers [105, 106].
We suspect that without the influx of genetic variation
from Brittany, intertidal habitat-forming macroalgae,
such as F. serratus, may largely disappear from southern
edges but retain potential to persist in small subtidal
bottleneck populations in cool upwelling regions [107].
