Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a powerful technique for determining the structures of biological 
macromolecular complexes. Picking single-protein particles from cryo-EM micrographs is a crucial 
step in reconstructing protein structures. However, the widely used template-based particle picking 
process is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Though machine learning and artificial intelligence 
(AI) based particle picking can potentially automate the process, its development is hindered by lack 
of large, high-quality labelled training data. To address this bottleneck, we present CryoPPP, a large, 
diverse, expert-curated cryo-EM image dataset for protein particle picking and analysis. It consists of 
labelled cryo-EM micrographs (images) of 34 representative protein datasets selected from the Electron 
Microscopy Public Image Archive (EMPIAR). The dataset is 2.6 terabytes and includes 9,893 high-
resolution micrographs with labelled protein particle coordinates. The labelling process was rigorously 
validated through 2D particle class validation and 3D density map validation with the gold standard. 
The dataset is expected to greatly facilitate the development of both AI and classical methods for 
automated cryo-EM protein particle picking.
Background & Summary
Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is an experimental technique that captures 2D images of biological mol-
ecules and assemblies (protein particles, virus, etc.) at cryogenic temperature using ‘direct’ electron-detection 
camera technology1. With the advent of cryo-EM, there has been a boom in structural discoveries relating to 
biomolecules, particularly large protein complexes and assemblies. These 3D structures of proteins2 are impor-
tant for understanding their biological functions3 and their interactions with ligands4,5, which can aid both basic 
biological research and structure-based drug discovery4,6. A key step of constructing protein structures form 
cryo-EM data is to pick protein particles in cryo-EM images (micrographs). Before diving into recent devel-
opments in protein particle picking and the bottleneck it faces, it is important to understand the physics and 
chemistry behind the grid preparation and micrograph image acquisition in cryo-EM experiments.
Cryo-EM grid preparation and image acquisition
The process of acquiring the two-dimensional projections of biomolecular samples (e.g., protein particles) can 
be summarized in four brief steps: (1) sample purification, (2) cryo-EM grid preparation, (3) grid screening 
and evaluation, and (4) image capturing. Once the sample is purified according to the standard protocols7; the 
next step of the single-particle procedure is to prepare the cryo-EM specimen. The grid preparation process, 
also known as vitrification, is straightforward. An aqueous sample is applied to a grid, which is then made thin. 
Eventually, the grid is plunged frozen at a time scale that inhibits the crystalline ice formation. Additionally, the 
particles must be evenly distributed across the grid in a wide range of orientations. It is very difficult to achieve 
a perfect cryo-EM grid because particles may choose to adhere to the carbon layer instead of being partitioned 
into holes. They may also adopt preferred orientations within the vitrified ice layer, which reduces the number 
of unique views8. The grid is ready for analysis once the cryo-EM sample is successfully inserted into the elec-
tron microscope9. Images are routinely captured during the screening phase at various magnifications to check 
for ice and particle quality. After the grids are optimized and ready for cryo-EM data collection, they are taken

to a cryo-EM facility where qualified professionals load specimens into the microscope. To enable the best 
high-quality image capturing, experts adjust several parameters such as magnification, defocus range, electron 
exposure, and hole targeting techniques (see Fig. 1A–F illustrating the process of preparing cryo-EM samples 
and acquiring cryo-EM images). More details regarding cryo-EM sample preparation and image acquisition can 
be found in these studies7,10.
Cryo-EM micrographs and single particle analysis
When the electron beam passes through a thin vitrified sample, it creates 2D image projections (see Fig. 1 for a 
visual illustration) of the samples (e.g., protein particles). The projections of the particles in various orientations 
are stored in different image formats (MRC, TIFF, TBZ, EER, PNG, etc.) which are called micrographs. Once 
the micrographs are obtained, the objective is to locate individual protein particles in each micrograph while 
avoiding crystalline ice contamination, malformed particles and grayscale background regions. In other words, 
the input for the particle picking problem is a micrograph, while the desired output is the coordinates of every 
protein particle in that micrograph (refer to Fig. 1 for the entire pipeline). Accurate detection of particles is 
necessary, as the presence of false positive particles can complicate subsequent processing, and eventually cause 
the 3D reconstruction process to fail entirely. The picking task is challenging due to several factors, including 
high noise levels caused by ice and contamination, low contrast of particle images, particles with heterogenous 
conformations, and unpredictability in an individual particle’s appearance caused by variation in orientation. 
Once the particles are extracted from the micrographs, single particle analysis is performed to reconstruct the 
3D density map and protein structure.
Advances and challenges in single protein particle picking
Several research initiatives were carried out worldwide to improve hardware11–13 and software14–17 to streamline 
and automate the cryo-EM data collection and processing steps for the determination of 3D structures18. The 
recent technological advances in sample preparation, instrumentation, and computation methodologies have 
enabled the cryo-EM technology to solve many protein structures at better than 3 A resolution. To obtain a 
high-resolution protein structure, selecting enough high-quality protein particles in cryo-EM images is critical. 
However, protein particle picking is still largely a computationally expensive and time-consuming process. One 
challenge facing cryo-EM data analysis is to develop automated particle picking techniques to circumvent man-
ual intervention. To tackle the problem, numerous automatic and semi-automatic particle-picking procedures 
have been developed.
A common technique for particle picking, known as template matching, uses user-predefined particles as 
templates for identifying particles in micrographs through image matching. However, because of varied ice 
contamination, carbon areas, overlapping particles, and other issues, the template matching often selects invalid 
particles (e.g., false positives). So subsequent manual particle selection is necessary.
To deal with the issue, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning-based approaches have been pro-
posed, which can be less sensitive to impurities and more suitable for large-scale data processing and therefore 
hold the potential of fully automating the particle picking process. XMIPP19, APPLE picker20, DeepPicker21, 
DeepEM22, FastParticle Picker23, crYOLO24, PIXER25, PARSED26, WARP27, Topaz28, AutoCryoPicker29, and 
DeepCryoPicker30, can be taken as good examples of such efforts.
The datasets used to train and test machine learning particle picking methods were curated from EMPIAR31. 
It contains almost all the publicly available raw cryo-EM micrographs. It is a public repository containing 
1,159 entries/datasets (2.39 PB) as of Jan 29, 2023. It includes not just cryo-EM images of proteins, but also 
Soft X-ray Tomography (SXT), cryo-ET and many other microscopic projections of other biological samples. 
Only some cryo-EM images of a small number of datasets in EMPIAR contain particles manually labelled 
by the original authors of the data. Therefore, most existing machine learning methods for particle picking 
were trained and tested on only a few manually labeled datasets of a few proteins like Apoferritin and Keyhole 
Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH). The methods trained on the limited amount of particle data of one or a few pro-
teins cannot generalize well to pick particles of various shapes in the cryo-EM micrographs of many diverse 
proteins in the real world. Therefore, even though machine learning particle picking is a promising direction, 
no machine learning method has been able to replace the labor-intensive template-based particle picking in 
practice. Therefore, the lack of manually labelled particle image data of diverse protein types is hindering the 
development of machine learning and AI methods to automate protein particle picking.
Creating a high-quality manually labelled single-protein particle dataset of a large, diverse set of represent-
ative proteins to facilitate machine learning is a challenging task. Single-particle cryo-EM images suffer from 
high background noise and low contrast due to the limited electron dose to minimize the radiation damage 
to the biomolecules of interest during imaging, which makes particle picking difficult even for humans. Low 
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the micrographs, presence of contaminants, contrast differences owing to varying 
ice thickness, background noise fluctuation, and lack of well-segregated particles further increases the difficulty 
in particle identification32. This is one reason there is still a lack of large manually curated protein particle data-
sets in the field.
A common problem of the particle picking algorithms trained on a small amount of particle data of a few 
proteins is that they cannot distinguish ‘good’ and ‘bad’ particles well, including overlapped particles, local 
aggregates, ice contamination and carbon-rich areas33. For instance, the methods: DRPnet34, TransPicker35, 
CASSPER36, and McSweeney et al.’s method37 that made significant contributions to the particle selection prob-
lem suffered the two similar problems. Firstly, there is not a sufficient and diversified dataset to train them. 
Secondly, there are not enough manually curated data to test them. The similar problems happened to other 
supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods, such as an unsupervised clustering approach38, 
AutoCryoPicker29, DeepCryoPicker30, APPLE picker20, Mallick et al.’s method39, gEMpicker40, Langlois et al.’s

method33, DeepPicker21, DeepEM22, Xiao et al.’s method23, APPLE picker20, Warp27, SPHIRE-crYOLO41, and 
HydraPicker42 all encountered similar problems. They usually perform well on the small, standard datasets used 
to train and test them (e.g., Apoferritin and KLH), but may not generalize well to non-ideal, realistic datasets 
containing protein particles of irregular and complex shapes, which are generated daily by the cryo-EM facility 
around the world.
To address this key bottleneck hindering the development of machine learning and AI methods for auto-
mated cryo-EM protein particle picking, we created a large dataset of cryo-EM micrographs, named CryoPPP43, 
which includes manually labelled protein particles. The micrographs are associated with 34 representative pro-
teins of diverse sequences and structures that cover a much larger protein particle space than the existing data-
sets of a few proteins such as Apoferritin and KLH.
In this study, we ensured the inclusivity of diverse protein particles by considering various protein types, 
shape patterns, sizes (ranging from 77.14 kDa to 2198.78 kDa), source organisms, and different variations of the 
micrographs. Supplementary Table S3 provides the additional information on the different protein types that 
were selected to label particles. Additionally, we incorporated cryo-EM images with varying defocus values asso-
ciated with each EMPIAR ID to include a diverse set of micrographs. The box-whisker plot in Supplementary 
Fig. S1 shows the diversity of the defocus values in each EMPIAR ID.
Machine learning methods yield best results when being trained on a diverse set of representative data. 
Hence, we included micrographs containing particles with different physical features and complexities, as shown 
in Fig. 2. Figure 2A–D depict the most ideal cases of particle picking in which the protein particles are visible to 
naked eyes. If machine learning methods are only trained solely on these micrographs, they perform relatively 
well in the simple cases but poorly on more challenging micrographs that have low signal-to-noise ratio. Thus,

we selected difficult micrographs that contain both particles and lots of ice patches, contaminations (Fig. 2B) 
and carbon regions (Fig. 2C).
In addition to the aforementioned variations in the micrographs, CryoPPP also comprises micrographs con-
taining mono-dispersed (Fig. 2D) particles characterized by particles of uniform size and micrographs with 
heterogenous confirmations that have varying top, side and inclined views of particles. Other micrographs with 
sub-optimal concentration of particles, clusters of proteins, and non-uniform ice distributions were included. 
The detailed features of the 34 diverse sets of cryoEM micrographs in CryoPPP are described in Supplementary 
Table S3.
The quality of the manually labeled particles of selected proteins was eventually validated rigorously. This 
validation was done against particles originally labelled by the authors who generated the cryo-EM data (called 
gold standard here) by both 2D particle class validation and 3D cryo-EM density map validation. The quality of 
our manual annotation is on par with the annotations provided by the experts who created the data in the first 
place, which confirms our manual particle labelling process is effective. Therefore, we believe CryoPPP is a valu-
able resource for training and testing machine learning and AI methods for automated protein particle picking.
Methods
CryoPPP was created through a series of steps as shown in Fig. 3. We first crawled the data from the EMPIAR 
website using python API and FTP scripts fetched through Bash scripting. We filtered out microscopic images 
of various non-single-protein particles (e.g., bacteria, filaments, RNA, protein fibril, virus-like particles) and 
retained only high-resolution micrographs acquired by cryo-EM technique for manual particle labeling.
After importing the micrographs with all the physiochemical parameters gathered from the corresponding 
published literature, we performed motion correction and Contrast Transfer Function (CTF) estimation for 
them. After preparing the micrographs, two human experts conducted an initial manual particle selection pro-
cess separately, using low pass filter values and appropriate particle diameter settings, on approximately 20 out 
of about 300 micrographs per selected protein (EMPIAR ID).
The expert-picked particles were cross-validated and then went through 2D particle classification. The best 
particles based on resolution, particle count, and visually appealing and sensible 2D classes were selected and 
further used for template-based particle picking and further human inspection. After iterating the 2D classes 
from template-based picking and human inspection, we ultimately obtained the final set of highly confident pro-
tein particles as ground truth and exported them in the files in star, csv and mrc formats. The first two files (.star 
and.csv) contain the coordinates of the protein particles and the latter (.mrc) store particle stacks. The process of 
creating CryoPPP in Fig. 3 is described in the following sections in detail.
EMPIAR metadata collection and filtering. 
The process of preparing the dataset began with collecting 
metadata about cryo-EM image datasets in EMPIAR. Data collection scripts that use python API and FTP pro-
tocols were used to automatically download the metadata from the EMPIAR web portal31. The metadata includes 
EMPIAR ID of each cryo-EM dataset of a protein, the corresponding Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) 
ID, Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID, size of dataset, resolution, total number of micrographs, image size/type, pixel 
spacing, micrograph file extension, gain/motion correction file extension, FTP path for micrograph/gain files, 
Globus path for micrograph/gain files, and publication information.
Following the metadata collection, the individual cryo-EM datasets in the collection were filtered as depicted 
in Fig. 4 (Steps 1–5). First, we only chose EMPIAR IDs (datasets) that have their volume maps deposited in 
EMDB. From the chosen EMPIAR datasets, we only selected ones that had corresponding protein structures in 
the Protein Data Bank (PDB).
To ensure high data quality, we then retained only the EMPIAR datasets whose resolution was better than 
4 Angstrom (Å). We observed that there were some redundant EMPIAR datasets (e.g., EMPIAR ID: 10709 & 
10707, EMPIAR ID: 10899 & 10897) that correspond to the same biomolecule with the same PDB and EMDB 
IDs. Hence, we eliminated those duplicate entries. After removing duplicate records, we selected only EMPIAR 
datasets that contained micrographs of protein particles, excluding other biological samples such as viruses. 
This filtering step required some literature study of individual EMPIAR datasets. The motion correction and 
gain correction files for the selected datasets were extracted from the EMPIAR if required. The final list of meta 
data includes 335 EMPIAR entries, 34 out of which were used for manual labelling. Refer to the EMPIAR_meta-
data_335.xlsx file in CryoPPP for further information about the list of 335 datasets of 355 proteins.
Manual particle labeling. 
Manually picking particles in cryo-EM micrographs through the GUI interfaces 
of cryo-EM analysis tools such as CryoSPARC16, EMAN214 and RELION15 is very time consuming. We care-
fully imported large micrographs, carried out the motion correction, and estimated CTF, especially in the case 
when flipping and rotating gain files are required to match the input array shape of the micrograph and gain 
file. Furthermore, it takes a lot of disk space to store the labelled particle data together with the corresponding 
micrographs and particle stack files. Therefore, we chose 34 representative EMPIAR datasets out of 335 entries 
selected in the previous section for manual particle labelling to create the CryoPPP dataset, considering diverse 
particle size/shapes, density distribution, noise level, and ice and carbon areas. Moreover, proteins from a wide 
range of categories, such as: metal binding, transport, membrane, nuclear, signaling, and viral proteins were 
selected. See supplementary Tables S1, S3 for more details about the 34 proteins (cryo-EM datasets). Most of the 
pre-processing, manual particle labelling, real-time quality assessment, and decision-making workflows were 
performed using CryoSPARC v4.1.116, EMAN214, and RELION 4.015.
CryoPPP includes a total of 9,893 micrographs (~300 Cryo-EM images per selected EMPIAR dataset). We 
labelled ~300 micrographs per EMPIAR data because using all the micrographs in each dataset would result in 
32.993 TB of data, making it too large to store, transfer, and use for most machine learning tasks.

There is no rule of thumb to determine the number of particles required for training machine learning methods 
to achieve optimal performance. It varies from protein to protein. It is also worth noting that the resolution of 3D 
density map is not solely dependent on the number of picked 2D particles, but also on the inclusion of a diverse 
range of particle orientations, which can significantly improve the resolution. CryoPPP contains 2.7 million 
particles of 34 different proteins, which should be adequate for machine learning algorithms to learn relevant 
particle features. Typically, we utilized approximately 300 micrographs per protein to pick particles. However, if 
adequate particle views were not extracted from the first 300 micrographs, a larger number of micrographs were

employed. The different orientations of protein particles were assessed during the 2D classification and manual 
inspection stages which are elaborated in the subsequent sections.
Importing movies.  This is the crucial first step of particle labeling. For each EMPIAR dataset, we import two 
inputs: micrographs and gain reference (motion correction files). We analyzed the description of the EM data 
acquisition and grid preparation for each dataset in order to collect the important information such as raw pixel 
size (Å), acceleration voltage (kV), spherical aberration (mm), and total exposure dose (e/Å2) for the micro-
graphs in the dataset.
Furthermore, we obtained gain reference for micrographs if their motion was not corrected before. We used 
e2proc2d, a generic 2-D image processing program in EMAN214, to convert different formats of motion correc-
tion file (e.g.,.dm4,.tiff,.dat, etc.) to.mrc file since CryoSPARC accepts only.mrc extension. Then, based on the 
microscope camera settings and how the data was acquired during the imaging process, we applied geometrical 
transformations (flip gain reference and defect file left-to-right/top-to-bottom (in x/y axis) or rotate gain refer-
ence clockwise/anti-clockwise by certain degrees) relative to the image data. Supplementary Table S1 contains 
the details of input parameters for each EMPIAR ID. After importing movies and motion correction files, we 
proceeded to the job inspection panel of CryoSPARC to ensure that all input settings and loaded micrographs 
were correct.
Patch motion correction.  When specimens are exposed to an electron beam, the mobility of sample molecules 
(protein particles) during data acquisition can affect the overall quality of electron micrographs and lower the 
final resolution44. Hence, it is necessary to correct the movement of particles (referred to as ‘beam-induced 
motion’).
The causes behind this motion can be categorized into two types: (1) Motion from Microscope: It is caused 
by stage drift and usually occurs in microscope due to little amount of vibration left over after the stage has 
been aligned to a new position45. It moves the sample relative to the beam and optical axis. This motion is quite 
jagged in time, with sharp accelerations or twitches, but is consistent. The entire image will move in the same 
direction over time. (2) Motion from sample deformation: This motion is caused by the energy deposited into 
the ice by the beam, or energy already trapped in it, due to strained forces locked in during freezing. It is even-
tually released during the image capturing process. As the electrons pass through the samples, the energy from 
the beam and the temperature change causes the ice to physically deform and bend. That deformation is often 
smoother over time, but it can be highly anisotropic in space. In this case, various parts of the same image can 
move in different directions at the same time.
Both motions must be estimated and corrected to obtain high-resolution reconstructions from the data. 
In the patch-based motion correction step, we corrected both global motion (stage drift) and local motion 
(beam-induced anisotropic sample deformation) for the micrographs (as shown in Fig. 5A using CryoSPARC. 
In the anisotropic deformation plot in Fig. 5B, each red circle indicates the center of a single “patch” of the image, 
and the curves emerging from each circle show the motion of that portion of the sample. We can observe the 
correlation between the motion of adjacent patches. They move somewhat similarly to one another. To prevent 
the fit from being distorted by random noise in the micrograph, the patch motion correction algorithm imposes 
smoothness constraints on the motion.
Figure 5C are the examples of plots generated by patch motion correction that depict the computed trajec-
tories. The set of plots shows overall motion correction (an actual trajectory plot, followed by X-motion plot 
and Y-motion plots over time). In the overall motion trajectory over X and Y motion (Fig. 5C, Left), each dot 
represents the sample’s position from frame to frame. Here, the x and y axes represent the units of pixels in the 
raw data’s pixel size. The sample begins at point (X), moves downward, makes a curve and again changes direc-
tion toward the left-top, and then continues to descend to the left. We apply this trajectory to the input data by 
shifting each image in reverse of what the motion trajectory suggests and finally averaging images together. In 
other words, we track a sample’s motion during the exposure to undo it.

While curating CryoPPP, we noticed several factors (protein size, charge, and ice thickness) potentially influ-
encing the scale of local motion in Cryo-EM micrographs. Larger proteins tend to exhibit slower local motion 
than smaller ones, due to their increased mass and higher structural complexity. The charge distribution on a 
protein surface can also affect the scale of local motion, with highly charged proteins exhibiting more restricted 
motion due to the electrostatic interactions with the surrounding ice, while relatively neutral proteins may be 
more mobile. Additionally, we observed that the thickness of the ice layer surrounding a protein can influence 
local motion; thicker ice layers can provide more structural stability but may introduce more noise and distor-
tion in the micrograph.
Patch-based CTF estimation.  The contrast of images captured in the electron microscope is affected by imaging 
defocus and lens aberrations, which are adjusted by microscope operators to enhance the contrast. The relation-
ship between lens aberrations and the contrast in the image is defined by the CTF. It explains how information 
is transferred as a function of spatial frequency.

It is important to estimate CTF, which is then corrected during 2D particle classification and 3D reconstruc-
tion steps. Otherwise, the feasible reconstruction will have extremely low resolution. A full treatment of the 
effects of the CTF usually proceeds in two stages: CTF estimation and CTF correction. In CryoSPARC used in 
this work, the CTF model is given by the Eq. 1.

where Δz is defocus, λe is the wavelength of the incident electrons, Cs is spherical aberration, and f is spatial 
frequency. Φ represents a phase shift factor.
Most cryo-EM samples are not ‘flat’. Before a sample is frozen, particles tend to concentrate around the 
air-water interfaces, and the ice surface itself is usually not flat46,47. Because defocus has an impact on the CTF, 
distinct particles can have various defoci and hence various CTFs within a single image. To address this problem, 
CryoSPARC offers a patch-based CTF estimator that analyzes numerous regions of a micrograph to calculate a 
“defocus landscape”.
We performed a 1D search over defocus for every micrograph. Figure 6A depicts the 1D search for a particu-
lar micrograph of EMPIAR ID 1073748. This plot helps identify a particular defocus value that stands out among 
a variety of other defocus values (x-axis). Patch CTF creates a plot showing how closely the input micrographs’ 
observed power spectrum and the calculated CTF match. The CTF fit plot in Fig. 6B shows that the computed 
CTF matches the observed power spectrum up to a resolution of 3. 993 Å. The cross correlation between the 
observed spectrum and the calculated CTF is depicted by the cyan line in the plot. The vertical green line in the 
plot represents the frequency at which the fit deviates from CryoSPARC’s cross-correlation threshold of 0.3 for 
a successful fit.
We executed the patch CTF to obtain the output micrographs with data on their average defocus and the 
defocus landscape. When particles were extracted, this data was automatically used to assign each particle a local 
defocus value based on its position in the landscape.

Manual particle picking.  After performing the motion correction and CTF estimation, we manually picked 
particles interactively from aligned/motion-corrected micrographs with the goal of creating particle templates 
for auto-picking using ‘Manual Picker‘ job in CryoSPARC. Depending on the size and shape of the protein par-
ticles, we adjusted the box size and the particle diameter. Since picking particles on raw micrographs is extremely 
difficult, we tweaked the ‘Contrast Intensity Override’ while viewing micrographs in order to obtain the best 
distinctive view for picking particles.
It is particularly challenging to manually pick particles from micrographs with smaller defocus levels. 
Figure 7 illustrates the visualization of micrographs in the same dataset with different defocus levels for EMPAIR 
1053248. It is worth pointing out that the task of particle picking becomes significantly more challenging for AI 
methods when the micrographs have a low signal-to-noise ratio, contain numerous ice-patches, carbon areas, 
aggregated particles, and non-uniform ice distribution, as illustrated in Fig. 2B,C,E,G). Hence, to generate com-
prehensive templates, we manually picked particles from diverse micrographs and the micrographs with wide 
defocus range (see supplementary Fig. S1) and CTF fit values.
As manual picking was very time intensive, we selected a subset of micrographs (around 20 micrographs of 
each EMPIAR dataset) for manually picking initial particles for the subsequent template-based particle picking.
To ensure data reproducibility, the intermediate star files of manually expert-picked particles are deposited 
in CryoPPP and can be found under the ground-truth subdirectory. Additional information regarding the total 
number of manually picked particles, number of micrographs considered for manual picking, particle diameter, 
angular sampling, and minimum separation distance of particles are provided in the Supplementary Table S2.
Forming and selecting best 2D particle classes.  The manually picked particles went through the 2D classification 
step. This step helped to classify the picked particles into several 2D classes to facilitate stack cleaning and junk 
particles removal. To analyze the distribution of views within the dataset qualitatively, we specified a specific 
number of 2D classes. By doing this, we investigated the particle quality and removed junk particle classes, 
which ultimately facilitated the selection of good particle classes.
We specified the initial Classification Uncertainty Factor (ICUF) and maximum alignment resolution to 
align particles to the classes with 40 expectation maximization (EM) iterations. The diameter of the circular 
mask that was applied to the 2D classes at each iteration was controlled using the circular mask diameter in the 
case of crowded particles.
After the 2D classes were formed, we selected the best particle classes interactively to remove the junks. 
Figure 8 shows an example of 2D classification and selection of highly confident particles for EMPIAR ID 
1001749. We used three diagnostic measures to select the 2D classes: resolution (Å) of a class, the number of 
particles of a class (higher, better), visual appearance of a class. Considering only the number of particles in a 
class is not sufficient because some classes containing a small number of particles may represent a unique view 
of the protein.
Refer to the Supplementary Table S2 for additional details regarding the number of 2D classes in each 
EMPIAR dataset, window inner and outer radii, recenter mask threshold, number of iterations to anneal sigma 
as well as other relevant thresholds and parameters.
Template based picking and manual inspection and extraction of particles.  After the best particle classes were 
selected and exported, we used a template generated from the ‘Forming and Selecting Best 2D’ step to pick 
more particles. The process was iterative, meaning that the output of a round of ‘template-based picking and 
inspection’ was again utilized for ‘2D class formation’ step to form and select best 2D classes under the human 
inspection. This process was repeated until we acquired high resolution particles that include all possible particle 
projection angles.

The final templates with green boxes (as shown in Fig. 8) were used to execute auto-pick particles from 
micrographs. With CryoSPARC’s Template Picker, we used high resolution templates to precisely select 
particles that matched the geometry of the target structure. Figure 9A represents manually picked particles 
for EMPIAR-1001749 that work as templates to facilitate template-based picking that eventually results in 
template-based picked particles ready for human inspection as shown in Fig. 9B. We specified constraints like 
particle diameter in angstrom (see Supplementary Table S2 for more information) and a minimum distance 
between particles to generate the templates based on the SK97 sampling algorithm34 to remove any signals from 
the corners and prevent crowding. We observed that the blob-based in picking in RELION required minimum

and maximum allowed diameter of the blobs, whereas defining a single value for particle’s diameter works well 
in CryoSPARC’s template particle picking step.
Finally, the particles obtained by the template picking went through the manual inspection step, where we 
examined and modified picks using various thresholds. We adjusted the lowpass filter, optimum power score 
range, and normalized cross-correlation (NCC) score (see Supplementary Table S2) to improve the visibility 
of the picks. In this step, we removed false positive particles as depicted in Fig. 12B. While efforts were made 
to minimize false negatives during particle picking, it is important to recognize that the complete elimina-
tion of false negatives is impossible in one round of annotation. The 2D colored histogram plots as depicted in 
Fig. 12 were used to scrutinize micrograph median pick scores versus defocus for extracting the coordinates of 
high-quality protein particles. Hence, we have strived to optimize particle picking, aiming to minimize both 
false positives and false negatives and thus improving the accuracy and reliability of CryoPPP. We will continue 
to improve and update CryoPPP throughout its life cycle, considering the input from external users.
Data Records
The CryoPPP dataset43 consists of manually labelled 9,893 micrographs of 34 diverse, representative cryo-EM 
datasets of 34 protein complexes selected from EMPIAR. Each EMPIAR dataset identified by a unique 
EMPIAR ID has about ~300 cryo-EM images in which the coordinates of protein particles were labeled and 
cross-validated by two experts aided by software tools. The total size of CryoPPP is 2.6 TB. Additional statistical 
information about CryoPPP can be found in Table 1.
The full dataset is available at https://github.com/BioinfoMachineLearning/cryoppp. For researchers who 
have limited disk space, a much smaller light version of CryoPPP, called CryoPPP_Lite, can also be downloaded 
from the website. CryoPPP_Lite includes the micrograph files in the 8-bit JPG format and the particle ground 
truth files that only need 121 GB disk space in total, which is easier to store and transfer.

Each data folder (named by its corresponding EMPIAR ID) includes the following information: original 
micrographs (either motion-corrected or not), gain motion correction file, new motion-corrected micrographs 
(if original micrographs are not motion-corrected), ground truth labels (manually picked particles), and par-
ticles stack. The directory structure of each data entry is illustrated in Fig. 10. The data in each directory is 
described as follows. It is worth noting that if the original micrographs were not motion-corrected, we applied 
the motion correction to them to create their motion-corrected counterparts.
Raw micrographs. 
These are the two-dimensional projections of the protein particles in different orienta-
tions stored in different image formats (MRC, TIFF, EER, TIF, etc.). They can be considered as the photos taken 
by cryo-EM microscope. Original micrographs are from EMPIAR and can be either motion corrected or not. If 
an entry has a ‘gain’ folder, it includes both raw non-motion-corrected micrographs and their motion-corrected 
counterparts created by us. Users are supposed to use the motion corrected micrographs as input for machine 
learning tasks. The scripts for the motion correction are available at CryoPPP’s GitHub website.
Motion correction (gain files). 
It contains motion correction files (if motion in original micrographs not 
corrected before) stored in different formats like dm4 and mrc. It is used to correct both global motion (stage 
drift) and local motion (beam-induced anisotropic sample deformation) that occur when specimens (protein 
particles) are exposed to the electron beam during imaging. Correcting the motion enables the high-resolution 
reconstruction from the data.
Particle stack. 
Particle stack comprises of the mrc files (with names corresponding to individual micro-
graphs’ filenames) of manually picked protein particles (ground truth labels). These are three-dimensional grids 
of voxels with values corresponding to electron density (i.e., a stack of 2D images). To browse and examine this 
file, utilize EMAN214, UCSF Chimera50, or UCSF ChimeraX51.
Ground truth labels. 
Ground truth data contain the star and CSV files for both all true particles (posi-
tives) and some typical false positives (e.g., ice contaminations, aggregates, and carbon edges). The positive star 
(and corresponding CSV) files are the ground truth position of the picked particles combined in a single file for 
all ~300 micrographs per EMPIAR ID. While the negative star file consists position of the false positive parti-
cles. These star files contain information like X-coordinate, Y-coordinate, Angle-Psi, Origin X (Ang), Origin Y 
(Ang), Defocus U, Defocus V, Defocus Angle, Phase Shift, CTF B Factor, Optics Group, and Class Number of the 
particles.
To ensure the reproducibility of the dataset, we have included the intermediate data (Fig. 10, ground_truth 
>> intermediate_data) along with the intermediate metadata (presented in Supplementary Table S2). The inter-
mediate data comprise the star files of manually expert-picked particles, which were utilized to construct tem-
plates for further particle selection.
Besides, there is a subdirectory called particle_coordinates inside ground_truth, which contains csv files, 
with same name as raw micrographs. This sub-directory comprises individual protein particle’s X-Coordinate, 
Y-Coordinate along with their diameter and other physico-chemical information.
Technical Validation
To ensure that the dataset is of high quality, we applied numerous validations and statistical analyses throughout 
the data curation process.

micrographs, motion correction files, particle stacks, and ground truth labels (manually picked particles). The

Quality of data. 
As noted in Fig. 4, we ensure that the dataset exclusively contains micrographs obtained 
using the Cryo-EM technique. Only the EMPIAR IDs with resolution better than 4 Å are chosen for creating 
refined protein metadata and ground truth labels of protein particles. The detailed quality control procedures are 
described as follows.
Distribution of data. 
Diverse protein types.  To be inclusive and ensure unbiased data generation, we 
selected the cryo-EM data of 34 different, diverse protein types (e.g., membrane, transport, metal binding, sig-
nalling, nuclear, viral proteins) to manually label protein particles, which can enable machine learning methods 
trained on them to work for many different proteins in the real-world. We selected the datasets covering different 
particle size, distribution density, noise level, ice and carbon areas, and particle shape as they are influential in 
particle picking.
Diverse micrographs within the same protein type.  The variance in micrographs’ defocus values within a 
EMPIAR dataset is not accounted for by majority of the particle picking methods. This defocus variation causes 
the same particles to appear differently, altering the noise statistics of each micrograph. This makes it challeng-
ing to create thresholds to select high quality particles. Figure 7 shows an example how different defocus values 
impact the appearance and quality of Cryo-EM images in the same EMPIAR dataset. Therefore, during manu-
ally picking the particles, we included a wide variety of defocus levels and CTF fit.
We recorded the correlation between defocus levels and the pick scores/the power scores (shown in Fig. 11 
for EMPIAR-1059051) to assess the shape and density of a particle candidate independently. After calibration, the 
scores of each particle are recorded relative to the calibration line, and these values are used to define thresholds 
on the parameters.

that higher defocus correlates with higher NCC scores and same with Power score.

Reliability of ground truth annotations. 
Legitimacy of importing micrographs and motion correction 
data.  All the input parameters used to prepare for loading micrographs into the CryoSPARC system were gath-
ered from the appropriate literature. We adhered to the standards in the publications including data acquisition and 
imaging settings such as the microscope used, defocus range, spherical aberration, pixel spacing, acceleration volt-
age, electron dose and the correct usage of motion correction. Based on the microscope settings during the imaging 
process, we applied appropriate geometrical transformations. The defect files and the motion-correction files were 
flipped left-to-right or top-to-bottom and also rotated by specific degrees in clockwise/anti-clockwise direction as 
required. All these factors were thoroughly investigated and used during the data loading process in CryoSPARC.
Inspection of picked protein particles.  The picked particles were inspected using a 2D colored histogram, as 
shown in Fig. 12. A particle of interest would have an intermediate local power score and a high template cor-
relation (indicating its shape closely matches its template). Low local power scores indicate empty ice patches, 
even though it might resemble the template. Additionally, very high local power scores indicate carbon edges, 
aggregates, contaminants, and other objects with excessive densities that resemble particles.
As shown in Fig. 12 (B, bottom), we interactively specified the upper and lower thresholds for both the 
Power score and NCC score for each dataset improving the accuracy in the manual particle picking.
Cross-validation by two human experts.  The results of the particles picked by the two Cryo-EM experts were 
compared to each other to make sure they are consistent. For example, two EMPIAR IDs: EMPIAR-1002852 
and EMPIAR-1008153 with 300 micrographs (total 600 Cryo-EM micrographs) were used in cross-validation.

The results of the 2D classes were compared based on total number of particles in each class, relative resolution 
of particles in the class, and distinct views of the structure of particles. Similar 2D classes, as shown in Fig. 13, 
achieved by two independent Cryo-EM specialists validate the accuracy of the manually labelled particles.
Comparison with existing state-of-the-art AI methods of particle picking.  We conducted a comparison between 
the 3D density maps reconstructed from the particles picked by us and by two AI methods, namely Topaz and 
crYOLO. We utilized them to predict particles for two datasets, EMPIAR 10081 and EMPIAR 10345, each con-
taining 300 micrographs. Subsequently, the ab-initio density map reconstruction and homo-refinement were 
performed using the generated star files containing the picked particles. To avoid any bias in the comparison, we 
repeated the ab-initio 3D reconstruction trials with three different random seeds for each method. The GSFSC 
resolution results for the three trails for each method are presented in Table 2. CryoPPP outperforms both Topaz 
and crYOLO.
For EMPIAR 10081, Topaz picked around 100,000 more particles than we. However, the best resolution of 
the density map reconstructed from CryoPPP picked particles in the three trials is 4.59 Å, substantially better 
than 6.75 Å of Topaz. This suggests that Topaz may have selected a substantial number of false positives (e.g., 
ice contaminations) or may have selected the same protein particles multiple times with slightly different center 
positions. CrYOLO, on the other hand, picked a significantly lower number of protein particles than us, which 
resulted in the worst resolution (9.33 Å) among the three. Similar results were obtained on EMPIAR 10345. The

results confirm that the labeled particles in CryoPPP are of high quality and can be used to train/improve AI 
particle picking methods.
Cross validation with gold standard particles picked by the authors. 
Gold standard particles are 
those particles that were originally picked by the Cryo-EM experts who generated the cryo-EM data. There are 
only a few EMPIAIR IDs deposited in EMPIAR that have both the micrographs and the gold standard particles. 
To validate the accuracy of our picked particles, we compared our results with the already-existing gold stand-
ard particles that are publicly available through the EMPIAR website. We carried out 2D and 3D validation for 
EMPIAR-1034554 and EMPIAR-1040655 to validate our particle labelling process as follows.
2D particle class validation with gold standard.  In order to get the gold standard 2D particles of the dataset, 
we downloaded the particle stack image files (.mrc) and.star file with the attributes of picked particles from 
EMPIAR. We used the particle stack and the star files to create the 2D classification results using CryoSPARC. 
Eventually, we compared our 2D class results with the gold standard. We performed the comparison based on 
the total number of classes, total number of picked particles, resolution, and visual orientation of the protein 
particle for each EMPIAR ID. Our results and the gold standard results exhibit strong correlations. It is worth 
noting that a high number of particles alone does not necessarily yield high resolution. Selecting a decent num-
ber of high-quality particles spanning a wide angular distribution is important for generating high 2D and 3D 
resolution.

Figure 14 shows the visual illustration 2D classification results for EMPIAR ID 10345 and EMPIAR ID 10406 
published by the authors of the cryo-EM data and generated by us. They are consistent.
Table 3 compares 2D classification results generated by original authors and by us. In both cases, (Fig. 14A,B) 
the same 300 micrographs were used for comparison. On EMPIAR ID 10345, CryoPPP’s results have sub-
stantially better resolution than the authors’ results for both N = 50 and N = 10 classes. On EMPIAR-10406, 
CryoPPP’s results have better resolution for N = 50 particle classes and comparable resolution for N = 10 particle 
classes.
3D density map validation with gold standard.  The ab initio reconstruction of the 3D density map for EMPIAR 
10345 and EMPIAR 10406 was carried out using the gold standard particles picked by the original authors and 
the ones picked by us, respectively. The coordinates of the particle picked by the original authors were down-
loaded from the EMPIAR website. Three different random seeds were used in the ab initio reconstruction to

avoid random bias. The results of the 3D density maps, resolution, and direction of distribution obtained from 
the two kinds of particles are compared in Figs. 15, 16.
The detailed comparison results are reported in Table 4. The ‘loose mask’ curve in the Fourier Shell 
Correlation (FSC) plots uses an automatically produced mask with a 15 Å falloff. The ‘tight mask’ curve employs 
an auto-generated mask with a falloff of 6 Å for all FSC plots.
It is seen that CryoPPP outperforms the gold standard particles in terms of all the metrics on EMPIAR 10345 
and achieves very similar results on EMPIAR 10406.
These rigorous validations with the gold standard picked particles and the comparison with the existing 
state-of-the-art AI methods clearly demonstrate the high quality of the data in CryoPPP, which enable it to serve 
as either the benchmark dataset for compare AI and classical methods of particle picking or the training and test 
dataset to develop new methods in the field.
