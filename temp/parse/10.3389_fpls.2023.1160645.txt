Global soft fruit supply chains rely on trustworthy descriptions of product quality.
However, crucial criteria such as sweetness and ﬁrmness cannot be accurately
established without destroying the fruit. Since traditional alternatives are
subjective assessments by human experts, it is desirable to obtain quality
estimations in a consistent and non-destructive manner. The majority of
research on fruit quality measurements analyzed fruits in the lab with uniform
data collection. However, it is laborious and expensive to scale up to the level of
the whole yield. The “harvest-ﬁrst, analysis-second” method also comes too late
to decide to adjust harvesting schedules. In this research, we validated our
hypothesis of using in-ﬁeld data acquirable via commodity hardware to obtain
acceptable accuracies. The primary instance that the research concerns is the
sugariness of strawberries, described by the juice’s total soluble solid (TSS)
content (unit: °Brix or Brix). We benchmarked the accuracy of strawberry Brix
prediction using convolutional neural networks (CNN), variational autoencoders
(VAE), principal component analysis (PCA), kernelized ridge regression (KRR),
support vector regression (SVR), and multilayer perceptron (MLP), based on
fusions of image data, environmental records, and plant load information, etc.
Our results suggest that: (i) models trained by environment and plant load data
can perform reliable prediction of aggregated Brix values, with the lowest RMSE at
0.59; (ii) using image data can further supplement the Brix predictions of individual
fruits from (i), from 1.27 to as low up to 1.10, but they by themselves are not
sufﬁciently reliable.

1 Introduction
Soft fruits such as strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, etc. are popular and proﬁtable
fruit varieties. The annual consumption of strawberries in Europe is estimated to be more
than 1.2 million tonnes, which leads the market share of horticultural crops (Calleja et al.,
2012; Ministry of Foreign Affairs (CBI), 2021a; Ministry of Foreign Affairs (CBI), 2021b).
Worldwide production of strawberries is stable with increasing demands and prices and is

continuously growing even through the COVID-19 pandemic
(Chandler et al., 2012; Bos-Brouwers et al., 2015; Simpson, 2018;
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (CBI), 2021b). However, without the
protection of hard skins, soft fruits are vulnerable during
production and post-harvest activities. This results in signiﬁcant
food waste and economic loss (Fruitteelt, 1991; Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2011; 31
Stenmarck et al., 2016). The food loss and waste comprise up to
50% loss along the supply chain in some countries (Macnish, 2012;
Kelly et al., 2019), among which the production loss is the majority,
which consists of up to 20% (Terry et al., 2011; Porat et al., 2018). It
has been estimated that for every ton of food waste, €1,900 of
production and processing costs are lost. Moreover, it is argued that
50% of the waste could be edible (Stenmarck et al., 2016).
The nutritional and economic value of crops is inﬂuenced by
the harvesting strategy. However, subjective assessments and
inappropriate maintenance of fruit quality could bring conﬂicts in
logistics planning between suppliers and distributors, which results
in even further post-harvest loss (Ramana et al., 1981; Elik et al.,
2019). Therefore, early decision-making supports both ecological
and economic interests. To make logistic and harvesting decisions
as early as possible, it is highly desirable to predict the quality of
ready-to-harvest strawberries in the ﬁeld (Abasi et al., 2018; Corallo
et al., 2018; Soosay and Kannusam, 2018; Lezoche et al., 2020).
Multiple variables determine the quality of a strawberry,
including maturity, shape, sweetness, and ﬁrmness (Montero
et al., 1996; Xu and Zhao, 2010; Liu et al., 2014). As the majority
of strawberry products are consumed fresh, the taste is the highest
priority for most European consumers of strawberries (Chandler
et al., 2012; Ministry of Foreign Affairs (CBI), 2021b). Therefore, we
narrow our research scope of this paper to concern the interior
quality of the fruit, which is not directly told by their appearances:
this paper explores the assessment of the level of sweetness of
strawberries, which is quantitatively described by total soluble solid
(TSS) content in the juice of freshly harvested fruits, using
informatics and machine learning (ML) approaches.
Traditionally, the TSS content is measured by a refractometer,
quantiﬁed by the degree Brix (°Brix or Brix) (Azodanlou et al.,
2003). The measurement is expensive in both labor cost and capital
because the samples that are sent to destructive measurements can
no longer be sold (Gómez et al., 2006; Agulheiro-Santos et al., 2022).
To reduce errors and optimize the supply chain, there is a desire for
more accurate, quantitative, and non-destructive tools to assess the
quality of each fruit (Ventura et al., 1998; Mancini et al., 2020).
Therefore, we explore the feasibility of Brix prediction with easily-
acquirable data, such that the prediction can be carried out on-site
without speciﬁc fruit preparation.
Related research has demonstrated the feasibility of applying
computer vision (CV) in grading the quality of fruits (Zhang et al.,
2016; Liu et al., 2017; Munera et al., 2017; Klinbumrung and
Teerachaichayut, 2018) and in assessing speciﬁc quality attributes
(Montero et al., 1996; Azodanlou et al., 2003; Abeytilakarathna
et al., 2013; Vandendriessche et al., 2013). CV and spectral analysis
from hyperspectral imaging (HSI) are popular techniques that have
often been applied in investigating the intrinsic properties (Amodio
et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2020; Agulheiro-Santos et al.,
2022). High prediction accuracy could be was achieved when fruit
photos were acquired under a (mostly-)uniform experiment setup
(Xu and Zhao, 2010; Nandi et al., 2016; Mancini et al., 2020; Weng
et al., 2020; Shao et al., 2021). Such setup requires delicate devices
which hinder the applications in a real-world setting and on an
enormous number of samples. Moreover, the “harvest ﬁrst, analysis
second” methodology limits the possibility of adjusting the harvest
strategy for supply chain optimizations because strawberries stop
growing after being harvested. Hence, our study concerns the
implication of the fruit’s intrinsic characteristics by its appearance
under natural light, when the fruit is still on the plant.
Meanwhile, the micro-climate in the greenhouse and the
horticultural treatments strongly inﬂuence the harvest quality and
pace of growing (Choi et al., 2015; Sim et al., 2020; Dı́az-Galián
et al., 2021). The temperature, humidity, CO2 level, lighting
conditions, and irrigation are proven to be crucial factors (Hidaka
et al., 2016; Avsar et al., 2018; Corallo et al., 2018; Muangprathub
et al., 2019; Sim et al., 2020). The crop load is also argued to
inﬂuence the quality of fruits (Verrelst et al., 2013; Belda et al., 2020;
76 Correia et al., 2011). In modern horticulture, environmental data
is readily collected by ﬁeld sensors or climate computers in most
greenhouses (Hayashi et al., 2013; Samykanno et al., 2013;
Muangprathub et al., 2019; Sim et al., 2020). Nevertheless, these
point measurements cannot provide distinctive information to
specify the quality of individual fruits. Thus, our research
introduces approaches to integrate in-the-wild fruit images with
environmental and plant-load data in predicting the Brix values of
individual fruits.
By investigating the performances of Brix prediction models, we
aim at providing insights in answering two main questions: i) how
accurately can the models estimate the Brix values by different sets
of inputs? and ii) which data are valuable for training the Brix
prediction models? The research contributes from four
perspectives: i) we collected and labeled a dataset of strawberry
images and quality measurements, using commodity hardware; ii)
we designed a conceptual methodology of non-destructive quality
estimation; iii) we shaped and implemented our methodology to
predict the strawberry sugariness; iv) by comparing the model
performances, we suggest how to develop reliable prediction
models by CV and ML techniques.
2 Materials and methods
2.1 Data collection
Data were collected from May 2021 to November 2021. This
was carried out on overwintered trays of Favori strawberry plants in
a greenhouse at the Delphy Improvement Centre B.V. (Delphy) in
Bleiswijk, the Netherlands. Strawberries were cultivated in baskets
that were hung from the ceiling in the greenhouse. For the plants
monitored by the cameras, the harvesting frequency is mostly once
per week, or twice per week when the strawberries grow faster in
warmer periods. There is exactly one harvest round per day, so we
use “from a harvest” to describe the data collected from the
same date.

The data collection setup consisted of the following parts: i)
static cameras facing the planting baskets to take periodic photos; ii)
Brix measurements of the strawberries by the horticulturalists from
Delphy; iii) physical labels on the branches to identify the
measurement results of a strawberry with its appearance in
images; iv) climate sensors to record the environment in the
greenhouse and the outside weather; v) plant loads, represented
by the average number of Favori fruits and/or ﬂowersper unit area;
vi) other logs about the plant cultivation.
Representations of individual strawberries were the major inputs
to train the Brix prediction models. We considered image data because
they are objective and distinct. The images were collected hourly with a
time-lapse setting. The same sections of six example images are shown
in Figure 1. As is shown in the ﬁgures, we stuck a yellow label to
indicate the ID of a strawberry a few hours before the harvest
(namely the “ID label”), such that the strawberry’s appearance
in the images can be connected to the measurement results. The
measurement data that are assigned to identiﬁed strawberries are
called the “connected measurements” in the following text.
Based on previous research on inﬂuencing factors of strawberry
qualities (Chen et al., 2011; Correia et al., 2011; Avsar et al., 2018)
and the expertise of our collaborating horticulturalists, temperature,
humidity, radiation level, CO2 density, and relevant plant treatment
records (additional lighting, watering were all considered as the
environment data. The number offruits and/or ﬂowers per unit area
was counted weekly and noted as the “plant load”. Both the
environment and plant load data were collected by Delphy.
The strawberries with the ID labels were stored separately. On
the same day of the harvest, researchers from Delphy measured the
Brix value and the ﬁrmness of those strawberries, with a
refractometer and a penetrometer respectively. The size category
is deﬁned by a ring test, and the ripeness level is evaluated according
to the experience of the greenhouse researchers.
2.2 Methodology of experiment
implementations
We segmented the strawberries from the in-ﬁeld images, such
that only the pixels that describe the sample strawberry were
analyzed. We trained a Mask R-CNN model (He et al., 2017)
with a ResNet101 backbone for semantic segmentation. We used
the Detectron2 platform (Wu et al., 2019) to build the model. The
ResNet101 backbone was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. We
resized the image segments to 200*200*3 pixels. They were the raw
inputs for Brix prediction and feature extraction in the pa, the
image-with-env experiment, and the image-with-Brix experiment.
We considered only the last available observations, e.g. the
strawberry segment from the 5 image in Figure 1. In this way, we
limited the quality changes between when it was in the image and
when it was measured. We also normalized the colors of the images
to reduce the distraction from the changing lighting conditions
during the day by applying elastic-net regressions at the red, green,
and blue channels respectively.
To analyze the images in the image-only experiment, we built
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Variational Auto-
Encoders (VAEs) to analyze and encode the image segments of
individual strawberries with Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). The
models were either trained from scratch or with weights pre-trained
by other popular datasets such as the ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009).
Details of model architectures can be found in the supplementary
materials. We also introduced principal component analysis (PCA) in
the experiments for feature dimensionality reduction and model
regularization (Geladi et al., 1989; Shaﬁzadeh-Moghadam, 2021). By
taking the largest differences among the pixel data, PCA helps to
exclude disturbance from the shared information of strawberry images
to some extent. Hereafter, we use the word “encode” to represent the
process of dimensionality reduction by the encoder parts of the VAEs
and/or PCA. We use “attribute” to describe the content of information
that our model concerns. “Feature” or “input” represents what goes
directly to the models, such as information from the latent space of the
VAEs and/or after PCA.
We trained the CNNs, MLPs, the predictor part of the VAEs,
and the PCA models by the strawberry observations with connected
measurements, which are 178 out of 304 Brix measurements. We
trained the encoder and decoder parts of the VAEs by all the
segmentation outputs of the Mask R-CNN model. Hence, this
dataset includes images that were taken over the life cycles and of
more strawberries. The image-only experiment and the image-with-
env experiment applied the same encoders.
We designed the env-only experiment to analyze the relationship
between the environment data and the Brix. We used rolling averages
of the environment data over different periods. Since the environment
data does not include speciﬁc information about individual
strawberries, we took all of the 304 Brix measurements into account
and grouped them by each harvest. They are called the “aggregated

According to the images, by 9 am on 2021-08-20, the yellow physical label is stuck onto the branch. The strawberry 20.8.1.1 was harvested
between 3 pm and 4 pm of the same day, so the last time when it was observable on images was 3 pm, 2021-08-20.

Brix”. The reliability of the aggregated Brix could also be better ensured
by introducing more sample measurements. We not only trained
machine learning models to predict the value expectation, but also the
standard deviation (std.) and the percentiles from 10% to 90% (with
intervals of 10%). The representations of the Brix distribution were
considered in supporting further experiments of individual
Brix prediction.
Since the amount of data points was reduced to the same as the
days of harvests after the aggregation, the volume of the dataset
became too small to support the training of deep neural networks.
Hence, we applied linear regression (LR), support vector regression
(SVR), and kernelized ridge regression (KRR) models. In addition,
leave-one-out experiments were considered to enlarge the training
sets of the env-only experiment. That means we split only one data
point as the validation set in each experiment run, instead of
proportionally splitting. Under this setting, we ensured all the
data was used once in performance validation so that we could
get a predicted value at every data point. The performance of
individual Brix prediction in the env-only experiment is discussed
based on the results from the leave-one-out experiments, by
considering the predicted value expectation as the Brix
predictions of all harvests on the same day.
In the image-with-env experiment, we stacked the features of
images and the environment data according to the object
strawberries to train models. By the encoder parts of the VAEs
and the PCAs ﬁtting to the training set, we encoded the images to
image features. We trained the models of the image-with-Brix
experiment by the same image features but with the outputs from
the env-only experiment– predictions of the mean, std., and
percentiles, etc. We established four neural network architectures
to ﬁt the various size of features in both the image-with-env
experiment and the xpd, including three three-layer MLPs and
one four-layer MLP.
We used the Keras library (Chollet et al., 2015) to build and
train the CNNs, VAEs, and MLPs in the experiments. All model
training used the Adam optimizer (beta1 = 0.9, beta2 = 0.999) and a
learning rate of 0.0003. We considered random rotation, mirroring,
and ﬂipping to augment the image data. When training the VAE, we
also considered random scaling up to ±10%. We used the Scikit-
Learn library (Pedregosa et al., 2011) to conduct PCA and to
construct LR, SVR, and KRR models in the env-only experiment.
The KRR used polynomial kernels of degrees up to 3 and penalty
terms of 1 and 10. These are all state-of-the-art implementations in
data analytics.
For all experiments except with speciﬁc deﬁnitions, we split the
data into 7:1:2 for training: testing: performance validation. We run
each experiment 15 times with a ﬁxed series of data splits. All the
deep learning models were trained on a Geforce GTX 1080 GPU
under a maximum of 300 epochs.
3 Results
This chapter describes our research ﬁndings in four steps: i)
the exploration of the dataset that we collected; ii) our
conceptual methodology of designing the experiments; iii) the
model performance of each series of experiments respectively;
iv) two inﬂuencing feature selections: whether to use the plant
load data or not and which image encoder to choose. The last
section gives a comparison among the experiment series
and states our suggestions for developing a reliable Brix
prediction model.
3.1 An integrated dataset describing the
growth and harvest quality of strawberries
In order to predict Brix from non-destructive in-ﬁeld data, we
collected observations of the fruits and related environmental
records in a greenhouse. The observations were in the form of
images, and the environmental records are time-series and single-
value measurements. All relevant data were linked with the
observations of individual fruits. As such, we could implement
machine learning techniques to discover the mapping from the
collected data to the Brix values.
From April 2021 to November 2021, we recorded the growth of
strawberries by 13,400 images from three RGB cameras and
collected environmental records during this period. We measured
the Brix of 304 ready-to-harvest strawberries, which were selected
from 28harvests in 22 weeks. The overall statistics of the
measurement data set are shown in Figure 2. According to the
box plots and the line plot, the Brix at each harvest usually has a
median value lower than the mean. It is implied that using the
average sample measurements to estimate the Brix of every fruit has
a higher probability to overestimate the quality.
The environmental records during the data collection period
were archived hourly and were grouped by rolling averaging over
periods. As a preliminary analysis, we computed the correlations of
the environmental data under different averaging periods and the
aggregated Brix values of each harvest. The results indicate a strong
correlation between temperatures (measured on the leaves, plants,
and in the air), radiation levels, watering, and cyclic lighting
strengths with the mean Brix of each harvest. The correlations of
the Brix with humidity and CO2 density are weaker. Details are
shown in Figure S2 in Supplementary Materials.
3.2 Conceptual experiment design
We designed four series of experiments to study the
effectiveness of using these data, shown in Figure 3: we ﬁrst
analyzed whether the images (section 3.3) or the environment
data (section 3.4) could work alone in Brix prediction, and then
we considered two ways of data fusion (section 3.5).
In the image-only experiment, the Brix prediction model was
trained solely by the images of strawberries. We considered both
supervised learning (SL) and semi-supervised (SSL) in training the
models in this experiment series. A challenge in this experiment was
that the inclusion of non-relevant pixel data lowered the learning
process and even reduced the prediction accuracy. To reduce this
effect, some of the models were accompanied by additional
regularization procedures, such as conducting principal

component analysis (PCA) on the training dataset and using the
principal components as the features for learning.
We considered environmental records and/or plant loads as the
input in the env-only experiment. Together we call these the
environment data. In the primary step, we conducted correlation
analysis to classify the importance of each sort of attribute and to
deﬁne sets of features. Since the environment data cannot express
information about individual strawberries, we trained regression
models to predict the expectation and the distribution of Brix value
aggregations of each harvest.
We established the image-with-env experiment and the image-
with-Brix experiment respectively as two ways of integrating the
image data and environmental records in training. We encoded the
image of each strawberry to comprise the image features. These
features were combined directly with the environmental records to
train the neural networks in the image-with-env experiment. We
considered the image features and the aggregated Brix predictions
from the env-only experiment as the inputs in the image-with-Brix
experiment. The setup was chosen based on two assumptions: i) the
predictions from the env-only experiment are good indications of
the overall quality of harvests; ii) compared to predicting the
absolute Brix, the appearance information might be more helpful
in terms of estimating the relative position out of value distribution
of Brix.

We set up two exam baselines to evaluate the experiment
outcomes. Firstly, we used the average value of all the Brix
measurements as the expectation of the Favori species. It
represents the empirical Brix value that members of the soft fruit
supply chain usually believe, so it is named the empirical baseline. It
is the baseline of this Brix prediction study. Secondly, we considered
the average Brix of each harvest as the expected value. As it
represents the traditional way of sugariness assessment, which is
anticipated by sample measurements, it is called the conventional
baseline. According to the experiment setup, the conventional
baseline is essentially the optimal situation of models from the
env-only experiment.
We used root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute
error (MAE) to represent the model accuracy. The RMSE is
regarded as the main indicator of model performance. It gives
increasingly more punishments if the predicted value is further
from the ground truth. After running the experiments over different
dataset splits, we used the standard deviation of the RMSEs (RMSE-
std.) to indicate the robustness of model performances. The
coefﬁcient of determination (also called the R2 score) is
considered a quantitative assessment of the level of model ﬁtting.
It is the proportion of the variation in the dependent variable, i.e.
the individual or the aggregated Brix in this case, that is predictable
from the input data. Higher R2 scores indicate better correlations
between the inputs and outputs in the mapping.
3.3 Practical Brix prediction models cannot
be trained with images alone
By the image-only experiment, we inspect the feasibility to train
a Brix predictor with only images. We trained CNNs from scratch,
with transfer learning (TL), and with semi-supervised learning
(SSL) methods. The best-performing model of the entire
experiment series has an averaged RMSE of ca. 1.33 over different
validation splits.
As the horizontal lines in Figure 4 indicate, the selected model
outperforms empirical baseline, while it is slightly worse than
conventional baseline. It is implied that the appearances of
strawberries provide hints of the Brix to a limited extent, whereas
the time of harvest has more predictive power. We hence conducted
further experiments to unravel the other attributes for
Brix prediction.
Among the experiment results, we noticed that the involvement
of feature dimensionality reduction facilitates the model
performance. A possible mechanism would be that a large
proportion of overlapping features were condensed in the latent
space of VAEs or the orthonormal bases of PCA (Goharian et al.,
2007). Meanwhile, the model ﬁtting might also be regularized with
the help of PCA, particularly when the model was trained with a
small data set in our situation (Geladi et al., 1989; Delac et al., 2005).
These ﬁndings also motivated us to encode the images in the data
fusion steps of further experiments.
3.4 Models reveal signiﬁcant dependencies
of aggregated Brix on environment data
3.4.1 The performance in predicting
aggregated values
In the env-only experiment, we trained LR, SVR, and KRR
models to assess how well the collective Brix value can be predicted
with only the environment data. When aggregating the data points,
overﬁtting was an indispensable issue. Particularly, when the data
are very few whilst the inputs have a large dimension. To assess the
level of model-ﬁtting, we calculated the R2 score of models using
different subsets of features, hyper-parameters, and train-test splits
to predict the representations of value aggregations on the testing

standard deviation of RMSEs (RMSE-std) across different splits of validation sets. The models are grouped by the ending point of the periods of the
environmental records. The y-axis shows the minimum RMSE of models from the same group. The colors indicate the input attributes of the
experiment sets. The best performance of models using only image data is presented by a horizontal line. The contour around it indicates the
corresponding RMSE-std. The horizontal line in gray and brown indicates the two benchmarks that are mentioned in the methodology section.

data set. When we grouped the scores by the algorithms of models
to evaluate the level of model determination, we found more than
half of the LR models have a negative R2 score, which indicates that
simple linear models cannot ﬁt this mapping. With a stronger
regularizer, or with higher outlier ﬂexibility, the R2 scores of KRR
(alpha=10) and SVR models are more condensed to 0.5-0.6. The
generally higher R2 scores also indicate they are more practical
models in tackling this circumstance.
3.4.2 The performance in predicting
individual values
To make the results comparable, the predictions of the averaged
Brix were regarded as the estimation of all the strawberry
measurements at each harvest. The RMSEs were hence calculated
on the same validation splits as the other experiment sets take.
Figure 4 compares the effectiveness of using various periods of
environment data with other experiments, of which the time spans
are grouped by the ending time.
As the bars in Figure 4 demonstrate, when models use features
from the periods closer to the harvest time, they obtain lower and
less diverged RMSEs in general. The RMSE-std of the models in the
env-only experiment is lower than the best-performing model from
the image-only experiment. The result argues that even using only
the environment data in Brix prediction could train more reliable
and stable models. Hence, it is strongly suggested to involve the
environment data in training further comprehensive models.
3.5 Images give the power to
perform individual prediction
with environment data
Results from the env-only experiment indicate that we need
speciﬁc information to distinguish fruit-to-fruit differences from
each harvest. Since the environment data are all point
measurements, we encoded the images into 200, 50, 10, and 5
features by four combinations of VAEs and PCA respectively to ﬁt
the dimension differences between the two types of data. The image-
with-env experiment and the image-with-Brix experiment introduce
two ways of fusing the image feature and environment data.
3.5.1 Combining image features with direct
environmental information
The image-with-env experiment straightforwardly combined the
two types of data to train the MLPs for the individual Brix
prediction. Unsurprisingly, the lowest RMSEs from all the groups
outperformed the best models from the image-only experiment and
the env-only experiment, as is illustrated in Figure 4.
Curiously, the performance difference caused by the collection
time span of environment data was remarkably reduced in this
experiment. A possible reason would be that the MLPs also learn
the trend of changes within the time-series data – such that the
performance did not reduce as much as in the env-only experiment.
Meanwhile, the nonlinearity and regularization performed by
the neural network also ensured the robustness of the
model performances.
3.5.2 Combining image features with predicted
Brix distribution of a harvest
The fourth experiment, the image-with-Brix experiment, allows
us to explore another way of integrating the knowledge from the
two sorts of data: to use the image features to predict the relative
quality within the distribution of Brix values. We used the
predictions of Brix aggregations1 from the leave-one-out
experiments from the env-only experiment. Among all the
experiment series, the models from the image-with-Brix
experiment resulted in the lowest RMSEs, as illustrated in
Figure 4. Among the different features of the aggregated Brix,
models that were trained by Brix percentiles slightly outperform
the models that assumed a Gaussian-distribution ﬁt, i.e. using the
mean and std. as inputs.
3.6 Plant load is crucial as part of the
indirect environmental information
As is illustrated in Figure 5, introducing the plant load as part of
the input attributes has a positive effect on the model performances,
which is more outstanding on the models from the env-only
experiment. In the image-with-env experiment, the upper limit of
model accuracy was slightly improved. But more importantly, there
were notable decreases in the std. of RMSEs over different data
splits. Both changes were limited in the image-with-Brix experiment.
In all, we suggest that plant load is a crucial feature when the raw
environmental information comprises the input data.
Moreover, since our plant load data was averaged over different
branches of strawberries, they did not directly reﬂect the division of
nutrition on the camera-monitored plants as the literature suggests.
Hence, we suppose that the data could reveal the general inﬂuence
of the growing environment on strawberries in this greenhouse
compartment in an indirect and deferred way.
3.7 Image encoders have a noteworthy
inﬂuence on the model performances
The best-performing models of each family are considered in the
previous result discussions. However, the number of image features
also inﬂuenced the model accuracy. The information from different
latent spaces is illustrated in Figure 6. Figure 7 discusses the effects
when the image features are utilized with different representations of
environment data. When we used only the images in the prediction, it
is still important to keep as many features as possible. Referring to the
illustrations in Figure 6, it is indicated that considering the texture
and the shape of strawberries could have a positive inﬂuence on the
intrinsic quality representation. When using image features together
with the raw environment data, we cannot see much difference in the
best performances. Nevertheless, we observe an increase in the

RMSEs when using larger dimensions of image features with the
aggregated Brix. Overall, it is suggested that similar dimensions of
image features and the other source of data could generally achieve
better RMSEs.
4 Discussion
With this paper, we propose and evaluate a practical
methodology for estimating the sugariness of individual
strawberries, starting from planning the data collection setups.
This approach uses affordable devices to collect relevant
observations in the ﬁeld and does not require harvesting or
destroying the fruit. The experiment results demonstrate that it is
feasible to anticipate the quality of strawberries when they are still
growing. Such information could support the decision-making of
harvesting and supply-chain strategies of greenhouse managers.
According to Figure 4 and Table 1, the models using image features
with aggregated Brix information are the optimal choices among all the
attribute combinations. The models could reduce the RMSE by up to
28.8% and 18.9% from the empirical baseline and the conventional
baseline respectively. Compare to the image data, the environmental
information has shown to be more relevant for the models to learn
from, yet they lack the capability to tell fruit-to-fruit variances.
Compared to using data from a sole source, a mixed-use of both
could lead to an accuracy improvement of 10.0% and 6.2%, respectively.
Compared to other research in the ﬁeld, we included multiple
types of data to build machine-learning models. Our models show
competitive performances in the sweetness prediction of
strawberries [RMSE 1.2 from Sun et al. (2017), MSE 0.95 from

The models are ranked according to the “RMSE” column. the empirical baseline is calculated by using the Brix expectation of the strawberry variety as all the predicted values. the conventional
baseline is calculated by taking the average Brix of each harvest as the individual predictions. The MAE and RMSE of all models and benchmarks are calculated by averaging over 15 random
validation splits. The std. of the RMSE on each validation split is presented in the “RMSE-std” column.

Cho et al. (2019)] while using in-ﬁeld data collected more easily-
acquired devices. On top of that, the dataset that we collected for
pursuing this research is also useful for more research in this ﬁeld.
In the above-mentioned experiments, we performed all the
procedures step-by-step, yet we see the possibility to exploit
higher levels of model integration. Nevertheless, as state-of-the-
art computer vision technologies allow detection models to be faster
and more portable, expanding the capability of real-time
assessments of fruit quality could also be an interesting topic.
The research primarily studies in-ﬁeld and non-destructive data
that are worth to be considered in training Brix prediction models.
The images, which the prediction models were trained with, are
essentially a subset of the time-lapse image dataset. With the entire
dataset, further research is suggested to include temporal
information for reﬁning the quality prediction models. It is also
an interesting topic to explore the practicability of using earlier
images in forecasting future Brix values.
Our results suggest that environmental information plays a vital
role in training a reliable model. Particularly, the environmental
information from up to fourteen days before the harvest is crucial to
ensure the model’s accuracy. Nevertheless, we did not discuss the
detailed inﬂuence of speciﬁc sources of climate data on our model
accuracies. It is therefore recommended to conduct subsequent studies
on the effectiveness of learning with different environmental factors.
