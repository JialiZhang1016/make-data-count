Abstract: Reactions of a,b-unsaturated aromatic thioke-
tones 1 (thiochalcones) with Fe3(CO)12 leading to h4-1-thia-
1,3-diene iron tricarbonyl complexes 2, [FeFe] hydroge-
nase mimics 3, and the thiopyrane adduct 4 are described.
Obtained products have been characterized by X-ray crys-
tallography and by computational methods. Completely
regio- and diastereoselective formation of the five-mem-
bered ring system in products 3, containing four stereo-
genic centers, can be explained by an unprecedented,
stepwise (3+2)-cycloaddition of two thiochalcone mole-
cules mediated by Fe3(CO)12. Quantum chemical calcula-
tions aimed at elucidation of the reaction mechanism,
suggest that the formal (3+2)-cycloaddition proceeds via
sequential intramolecular radical transfer events upon ho-
molytic cleavage of one carbon-sulfur bond leading to a
diradical intermediate.
In recent four decades, rapid progress in exploring thiocarbon-
yl compounds such as thioketones and thiochalcones has
been observed.[1] On the one hand, aromatic thioketones were
demonstrated to act as highly reactive dipolarophiles, thus
R. Huisgen proposed for them the term “superdipolarophiles”
based on results of kinetic studies with such 1,3-dipoles as ni-
trones,[2a] diazomethanes[2b] and thiocarbonyl S-methanides[2c]
(Scheme 1, top). On the other hand, the observed high reactivi-
ty of thioketones in hetero-Diels–Alder reactions led to the
term “superdienophiles” coined by J. Sauer.[3] Therefore, thio-
chalcones, easily available by thionation of chalcones with
Lawesson’s reagent, form a unique class of a,b-unsaturated
aromatic thioketones which are able to react as heterodienes
with olefinic and acetylenic dienophiles yielding six-membered
thiopyrane derivatives (Scheme 1, middle).[4] Furthermore, thio-
chalcones were also described as reactive dienophiles towards
in situ generated a-nitrosoalkenes[5a,b] and chiral enamines.[5c]
Unexpectedly, thiochalcones reacted as C=S dipolarophiles in
(3+2)-cycloadditions with electron deficient fluorinated nitrile
imines derived from trifluoroacetonitrile.[6]
Characteristically,
in
solution,
during
chromatographic
workup, thiochalcones form an equilibrium mixture of the
monomeric and two dimeric species, namely 3,4-dihydro-1,2-
dithiin (dimer A) as well as 3,4-dihydro-2H-thiopyran (dimer B)
derivatives,
according
to
the
rules
of
hetero-Diels–Alder
chemistry (Scheme 1, middle).[7] On preparative scale, an effi-
cient separation of these three species is practically unfeasible
by chromatographic methods, and therefore they are isolated
as so-called “thiochalcone fraction”.[5b] Depending on the reac-
tion conditions, for example, solvent, temperature, catalyst and
the reagent applied for their conversion, thiochalcones can
react either as monomers or dimers, thus yielding a variety of
different products. For that reason, thiochalcones should be
considered as versatile and valuable but also “capricious”
building blocks in the organic chemistry of sulfur.
Along with the cycloaddition chemistry described above, an-
other research field focusses on exploring thioketones in coor-
dination and organometallic chemistry, particularly in the syn-
thesis of [FeFe] hydrogenase mimics.[8] In recent decades, a
great number of such [FeFe] hydrogenase model complexes
has been reported.[9] In this respect, our earlier publications

describe the preparation of [2Fe1S] and [2Fe2S] clusters, consi-
dered as mimics of [FeFe] hydrogenases, via a multi-step re-
action of aromatic thioketones with Fe3(CO)12 (Scheme 1, bot-
tom).[8b–d]
In contrast to aromatic thioketones, the exploration of thio-
chalcones in coordination and organometallic chemistry is
scarcely reported. For example, unlike extensively studied reac-
tions of 1-aza-1,3-dienes and 1-oxa-1,3-dienes with iron car-
bonyls,[10]
analogous
reactions
with
1-thia-1,3-dienes,
e.g.
monomeric thiochalcones, are almost undiscovered.[11]
Stimulated by the aforementioned observations on aromatic
thioketones, we investigated the reactions of Fe3(CO)12 with di-
verse aryl-, hetaryl- and ferrocenyl-functionalized thiochalcones
in a combined experimental and theoretical study. In extension
of the synthetic work, quantum chemical calculations were car-
ried out to unravel the reaction pathway leading to unexpe-
cted products.
The first series of experiments was performed starting with
Fe3(CO)12 and thiochalcone 1a (Scheme 2) in boiling THF. As
the accessible reaction pathways crucially depend on the initial
configuration of the thiochalcones, a precise knowledge of the
reactants at the molecular level is indispensable. Therefore,
LNO-CCSD(T)[12] calculations were performed to elucidate the
structural and electronic properties of four conceivable confi-
gurations of 1a, that is, a pair of E (EA and EB) and Z (ZA and
ZB) isomers (Scheme 2, top). The formation and reactivity of
dimers A and B (Scheme 2) has already been studied by theo-
retical methods.[5b] The computational results for 1a clearly in-
dicate the thermodynamic preference of the E isomers, of
which EA is as much as 6.8 kJmol@1 more stable than EB.
Both reagents, the thiochalcone 1a and Fe3(CO)12, were ap-
plied in a ratio of 3:1. After 1 h, 1a was completely consumed
and chromatographic separation of the oily crude material af-
forded a major fraction as a red solid. The 1H NMR spectrum
revealed the presence of two doublets with 3JH,H=9.4 Hz local-
ized at 6.91 ppm and 3.34 ppm, respectively. The molecular
formula C16H10FeO3S2 was confirmed by elemental analysis and
EI-MS methods. These data suggest that the structure of the
obtained product can be postulated as the h4-1-thia-1,3-diene
iron tricarbonyl complex 2a (22%, Scheme 2). Finally, this
structure was unambiguously confirmed by X-ray diffraction
analysis (Figure S5). The formation of 2a can be explained by
interaction of thiochalcone 1a with Fe3(CO)12 in a similar fa-
Scheme 2. Reactions of thiochalcones 1a–e with Fe3(CO)12 resulting in mono
and cyclic dinuclear iron complexes 2a–e and 3a–e, respectively, as well as
in thiopyran complex 4 (isolated for substituents Ar1=Ar2=2-Th[b], only).
Relative Gibbs energies of 1a (in kJmol@1) were obtained at the LNO-
CCSD(T)/cc-pVQZ level of theory. [a] Unexpectedly, a second experiment
with another sample of 1b resulted in a better yield of 4. [b] 2-Th=thien-2-

shion as previously described for analogous (h4-diene)Fe(CO)3
complexes.[10b] Notably, the structure of 2a is comparable to
those reported for tricarbonyl iron 1:1 complexes derived from
a,b-unsaturated thioamides and thioesters.[11]
During the chromatographic separation, a more polar frac-
tion was also isolated as minor product 3a (6%, Scheme 2). In
contrast to 2a, the 1H NMR spectrum of this product was more
complex. For example, two doublets were found at 5.98 ppm
and 3.85 ppm (3JH,H=2.1 Hz and 4.4 Hz, respectively). Moreover,
two doublets of doublets appeared at 4.08 ppm as well as at
3.56 ppm. Three HC(sp3) atoms were identified in COSY and
HSQC NMR spectra at 4.08 ppm, 3.85 ppm and 3.56 ppm. The
elemental analysis of that fraction allowed to establish the mo-
lecular formula as C32H20Fe2O6S4 which was also confirmed in
the EI-MS by virtue of m/z=647 [M-2 CO]+. The X-ray analysis
of 3a revealed its novel, yet rather unexpected structure, typi-
cal of a [FeFe] hydrogenase mimic (Figure 1). The molecular
structure of 3a, determined by X-ray crystallography, disclosed
its relative R*C1R*C2S*C3S*C6 configuration. Structurally, com-
plex 3a features a five-membered cyclopentene ring coordinat-
ed via two thiolato sulfur atoms to the Fe2(CO)6 moiety. It was
formed in a completely regio- and diastereoselective manner,
demonstrated by the presence of only one set of signals found
in both the 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra of the isolated fraction.
In order to elucidate the reaction mechanism leading to the
diastereoselective formation of 3a, quantum chemical calcula-
tions were performed (Figure 2A). A set of 16 adduct states,
originating from the coordination of the four possible isomers
of 1a (EA, EB, ZA and ZB) at the Fe2(CO)6 moiety, was consi-
dered. Two of these adduct states are sterically conceivable to
yield 3a diastereoselectively (Figure S1 and Table S1). These
two states originate from the most stable thiochalcone isomer
EA, as well as from the combination of one EA and one ZB.
However, to reduce the computational effort, and due to the
unfavorable thermodynamic properties of the Z isomers, only
two EA isomers were used to study the reaction pathway. The
reaction path connecting the closed-shell optimized structures
of the EA-EA adduct, denoted A(EAEA), as well as of the EA-EA
product, denoted P(EAEA), was approximated based on the
climbing image nudge elastic band (CI-NEB[13]) method (Fig-
ure 2A).
Images along the closed-shell singlet ground state reaction
path were optimized at the TPSSh[14]/def2-SVP[15] level of
theory; additional open-shell singlet as well as triplet single
point calculations were also performed. Initially, an instantane-
ous carbon–carbon bond formation (C1@C1) was observed
(Figure 2 B, step I). Subsequently, homolytic cleavage of one
carbon–sulfur bond proceeded, as indicated by the energeti-
cally favored open-shell singlet solution. This C@S bond break-
ing is accompanied by a partial planarization of the [2Fe2S]
cluster from its initial butterfly structure, yielding a diradical in-
termediate with one unpaired electron mainly localized at the
sulfur atom and the other electron delocalized along the p*-or-
bital of the C1-C2-C3 fragment, respectively (step II in Fig-
ure 2B). The localization of the two unpaired electrons is illu-
strated by the spin density in the vicinity of the transition
state. Consequently, an activation energy of 209 kJmol@1 is pre-
dicted, which is 10 kJmol@1 lower than for a heterolytic C@S
bond cleavage. In addition to the C@S cleavage and the
[2Fe2S] planarization, this energy is necessary to facilitate the
rotation of the [2Fe2S] cluster around the remaining C@S bond
hindered by the axial hydrogen atom HC3. Surprisingly, this
barrier is neither reduced considering implicit solvent effects
(THF) nor considering an open-shell (triplet) path (Figure S2 B-
C). However, a pronounced stabilization of the opened-shell
singlet solutions is expected along its optimized reaction path.
Unfortunately, such open-shell singlet path, connecting the
closed-shell adduct and product states, cannot be obtained as
the corresponding method has not (yet) been implemented in
the software packages available. Furthermore, a pronounced
stabilization of step II may be anticipated by explicit interac-
tion of 3a with solvent molecules. As for the interaction be-
tween two thiochalcone molecules forming 3a, the singly-oc-
cupied p*-orbital of the C1-C2-C3 fragment of the first molecule
overlaps with the p*-orbital of the C2@C3 fragment of the
second one which illustrates a formal (3+2)-cycloaddition. In
consequence, this interaction leads to the C@C bond formation
between C3 and C2 atoms of both molecules (Figure 2 B, ste-
p III). This bond formation is accompanied by the transfer of
the respective unpaired electron to C3 of the second thiochal-
cone molecule. Finally, intramolecular recombination of both
radical centers (Figure 2B, step IV) leads to a driving force of
@105 kJmol@1 and the selective formation of the cycloadduct
3a.
The reaction of 1a with Fe3(CO)12 was repeated in a 1:1 ratio
to increase the reduction equivalents and subsequently the
amount of 3a. In this experiment the yield of 3a was esta-
blished to 32% and of 2a to 7%, respectively.
The same ratio (1:1) was applied for reactions of thiochal-
cones 1b–e with Fe3(CO)12. The resulting products 2b–e

(Figures S5–S8) and 3b–e were also formed side by side, but
their ratios depended on Ar1 and Ar2 (Scheme 2, bottom). Simi-
lar to 3a, formation of 3b–e occurred with complete regio-
and diastereoselectivity, evident by 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra
registered for the isolated fractions. In all cases only one set of
signals was observed. In analogy to 3a, complexes 3d,e (Figur-
es S9, S10) feature the relative configuration of R*C1R*C2S*C3S*C6.
Again, complexes 3 can be considered as mimics of the H-clus-
ter of the naturally occurring [FeFe] hydrogenases,[16] thus they
are also of potential interest for the development of catalytic
hydrogen production processes. Therefore, their redox proper-
ties were evaluated in the absence and presence of a proton
source, that is, acetic acid (AcOH), using cyclic voltammetry
(CV). These CV experiments showed, that 3a–e catalyze the re-
duction of protons in the presence of AcOH (Figures S12, S13).
The reaction of 1b with Fe3(CO)12 deserves a word of com-
ment. In this case, formation of the dinuclear complex 4 along
with 2b and 3b, was also observed (Scheme 2). After isolation,
the identity of 4 was proven by spectroscopic methods and X-
ray analysis (Figure S11). The structure of 4 resembles the
product obtained after reaction of 7,7-dimethyl-6,8-dioxa-2-se-
lenaspiro[3.4]nonane with Fe3(CO)12.[17] Most likely, complex 4
was formed via reaction of the corresponding dimer B with
Fe3(CO)12.
It is worth mentioning that blue colored dimers of type B
are relatively stable in solution. In extension of the study,
dimer B derived from 1c was isolated and characterized by X-
ray crystallography (Figure S4).
In summary, the presented study showed that “capricious”
monomeric and dimeric thiochalcones react with Fe3(CO)12
yielding products of type 2, 3 and 4. In particular, diastereose-
lective formation of the five-membered ring in complexes 3
containing four stereogenic centers is an intriguing finding. A
plausible reaction mechanism involves an unprecedented,
stepwise (3+2)-cycloaddition of two thiochalcone molecules
bonded to Fe3(CO)12 via the sulfur atoms. Quantum chemical
calculations suggest that this reaction proceeds via a sequen-
tial intramolecular radical transfer initiated by the homolytic
cleavage of one carbon-sulfur bond resulting in formation of a
reactive diradical intermediate. Thus, the described results
demonstrate once more the unique ability of the sulfur atom
incorporated into the C=S bond to promote diradical mecha-
nisms governing the stepwise cycloaddition reactions of thio-
carbonyl compounds.[18]
