Abstract 
The role of genetic architecture in adaptation to novel environments has received considerable 
attention when the source of adaptation variation is de novo mutation. Relatively less is known 
when the source of adaptive variation is inter- or intraspecific hybridization. We model 
hybridization between divergent source populations and subsequent colonization of an 
unoccupied novel environment using individual-based simulations in order to understand the 
influence of genetic architecture on the timing of colonization and the mode of adaptation. We 
find that two distinct categories of genetic architecture facilitate rapid colonization but that they 
do so in qualitatively different ways. For few and/or tightly linked loci, the mode of adaptation is 
via the recovery of adaptive parental genotypes. With many unlinked loci, the mode of 
adaptation is via the generation of novel hybrid genotypes. The first category results in the 
shortest colonization lag phases across the widest range of parameter space, but further 
adaptation is mutation limited. The second category takes longer and is more sensitive to genetic 
variance and dispersal rate, but can facilitate adaptation to environmental conditions which 
exceed the tolerance of parental populations. These findings have implications for understanding 
the origins of biological invasions and the success of hybrid populations.

Introduction 
A persistent question regarding the source of adaptive variation leading to colonization is 
why intra and interspecific admixture – hereafter collectively referred to as hybridization – 
sometimes leads to increased colonization success and sometimes does not (Bock et al., 2015; 
Dlugosch et al., 2015).  Hybridization can contribute to colonization by producing an overall 
increase in standing genetic variation, by transferring adaptive alleles between genetic 
backgrounds (adaptive introgression), or by producing novel genotypes in hybrids (transgressive 
segregation) (Pfennig et al., 2016). Many species complexes are known in which hybridization 
may have contributed to colonization in these ways (Ellstrand and Schierenbeck, 2000; 
Schierenbeck and Ellstrand, 2008). However, hybridization doesn’t always contribute to 
increased colonization success, and identifying the genetic factors which may influence when 
and how hybridization contributes to colonization has become a central objective of the field of 
invasion genetics (Bock et al., 2015).  
A second persistent question in invasion genetics is what the genetic architecture of so-
called invasiveness traits tends to be (Bock et al., 2015; Dlugosch et al., 2015). Genetic 
architecture here is defined as the number of loci governing a quantitative trait, their positions 
within the genome, and the interactions among different alleles and loci. Much is already known 
about the genetic architecture of adaptation to heterogeneous environments when adaptation 
stems from de novo mutation. For example, models of adaptation across linear gradients have 
demonstrated the importance of sufficient genetic variance (Kirkpatrick and Barton, 1997), two 
patch models have demonstrated the importance of mutations of large effect (Gomulkiewicz et 
al., 1999; Holt et al., 2003), and a recent evaluation of adaptation across an approximately 
continuous landscape demonstrated the potential importance of both high genetic variance and

mutations of large effect (Gilbert and Whitlock, 2017). However, range expansion may 
commonly be facilitated by gene flow rather than de novo mutation, and studies on the genetic 
architecture of colonization and range expansion stemming from hybridization are currently 
lacking.   
Here, we wish to examine how genetic architecture itself influences when and how 
hybridization contributes to colonization success. Hybrid invasions present a unique combination 
of population genetic forces which may interact with genetic architecture in important ways. For 
example, selection on beneficial variation within a population receiving migrants may be 
rendered ineffective due to genetic swamping – the homogenizing effect of persistent gene flow 
(García‐Ramos and Kirkpatrick, 1997; Yeaman and Otto, 2011; Yeaman and Whitlock, 2011). 
The strength of genetic swamping may be modulated by genetic architecture. Architectures 
dominated by alleles with large selection coefficients and/or tightly linked loci are more resistant 
to swamping than those dominated by alleles with small selection coefficients and/or unlinked 
loci (Tigano and Friesen, 2016; Yeaman and Whitlock, 2011), although architectures 
characterized by many alleles of small effect may be robust to genetic swamping when genetic 
variance is sufficiently high (Yeaman, 2015). The implication of this is that, when looking 
retrospectively at adaptations in systems where there has been persistent gene flow, swamping-
resistant genetic architectures may be more likely to be observed. 
When hybridization occurs between divergent populations in a new environment, as would 
be the case between introduced taxa or between an introduced and native taxon, colonization 
success may depend on the ability to recover and maintain adaptive variation in the face of 
persistent migration from these divergent source populations. In fact, the time required for 
natural selection to drive adaptive genetic variation to high frequency is a proposed explanation

for one of the most ubiquitous phenomena in invasion biology; the initial lag phase in which 
introduced populations persist in low numbers before rapid growth (Crooks, 2005; Crooks and 
Soulé, 1999). Using a source-sink model incorporating adaptation from mutation, Holt et al. 
(2003) demonstrated that transient occupancy of a sink can persist for a long time before 
punctuated growth following adaptation.  
Given these findings, we hypothesize that genetic architecture, which will influence the 
recovery of adaptive variation in newly formed hybrid populations, will also influence the 
duration of the lag phase. If the lag phase is sufficiently long, we may not witness its resolution 
within our limited window of observation, and conclude that hybridization has failed to 
contribute to colonization. We hereafter refer to the idea that the genetic architecture of 
invasiveness traits should influence the contribution of hybridization to colonization – as the 
architecture hypothesis of hybrid invasion. 
Here we test the architecture hypothesis of hybrid invasion using individual based 
simulations. Specifically, we test two underlying predictions: (1) that colonization lag phase 
duration is sensitive to the genetic architecture of invasiveness traits, (2) that architectures 
resistant to genetic swamping will produce relatively short lag phases. Given our results, we then 
test an additional prediction: the filtering effect of colonization on genetic architecture will 
influence the ability of resulting colonist populations to occupy and adapt to more extreme 
environments – an important characteristic for hybrid speciation and adaptive radiation.

Methods 
We simulated colonization in a source-sink scenario involving dispersal from two divergent 
source populations using quantiNemo2 (Neuenschwander et al., 2008). Generations were 
discrete and consisted of four life cycle events in the following order: reproduction, offspring 
dispersal, aging, and regulation of adults. We generated polymorphic populations in two separate 
patches with differing environmental optima. Each initial allele in the population was drawn 
from a discretized normal distribution with variance specified by the allelic variance of the 
genetic architecture (Table 1). The populations then experienced a burn-in period with selection 
and mutation, but no dispersal, in order that they attain mutation-selection-drift equilibrium 
within each patch. Unless otherwise specified, the burn-in period was 10,000 generations. We 
then allowed one-way dispersal from these two source populations into a novel environment (the 
sink) for 500 generations – a timeframe relevant for most contemporary invasions – which we 
refer to as the colonization phase. We assume that occupancy of the novel environment by either 
source population alone is dependent on recurrent immigration. Thus, it will serve as a sink for 
maladapted migrants from the source populations, at least initially. 
We simulated two quantitative traits and subjected them to stabilizing selection. For the first 
trait, one source population generated an adaptive genotype during the burn-in period relative to 
the optimum of the sink patch while the

other source population generated a 
maladaptive genotype (Figure 1). The 
opposite was true for the second trait, 
resulting in each source population 
possessing an adaptive genotype for one 
trait and a maladaptive genotype for the 
other with respect to the trait optimum in 
the sink. In this way, all of the standing 
genetic variation necessary to adapt to the sink is present in the two source populations at the 
start of the colonization phase, but it must be assembled via recombination in the sink.  
We evaluated a range of differences in environmental optima (DZopt of 6, 8, and 10) between 
source patches, where Zopt represents the optimal phenotype for each quantitative trait. For 
reference, one unit of Zopt is equivalent to two-fold the variance of the mutation effect size 
distribution for 1-locus architectures. This range is intermediate between smaller values of DZopt 
that yield successful colonization by a single source population in the absence of hybridization, 
and larger values that fail to colonize under a variety of genetic architectures. Thus, the range of 
values of DZopt we employ encompasses the environmental optima relevant for our analysis of 
hybridization’s contribution to colonization, given the other assumptions we make about the 
strength of selection (discussed below).  
 
Reproduction and dispersal 
Reproduction followed a Wright-Fisher Model with a variable population size, N, of diploids 
in which random mating occurred with any individual in the same patch, including self-mating,

with probability 1/N. Fecundity for each individual was drawn from a Poisson distribution with a 
mean of four. Growth within each patch was governed by the fecundity of its individuals, and 
each patch had a carrying capacity of 1000 individuals. We allowed one-way dispersal from 
source populations into the sink at dispersal rates of d=10-2 and d=10-3 during the colonization 
phase, where dispersal rate is the probability of an offspring migrating to the sink. Our 
justification for using these rates is as follows; based on our previous assumptions, the total 
expected number of migrants Nm entering the sink per generation can be written as  𝑁" = 2𝐾𝑓𝑑. 
This simplifies to 𝑁" = 8000𝑑, given that carrying capacity 𝐾= 1000 for both source 
populations and fecundity f has a mean of four. At d=10-1, Nm=800, which could result in the 
sink reaching carrying capacity solely due to the influx and chance survival of migrants, which 
would not be of interest. At the other extreme of d=10-4, Nm=0.8, which may not provide 
sufficient opportunity for hybridization to occur within 500 generation. We therefore limit our 
analysis to intermediate values of d=10-2 and d=10-3, for which Nm=80 and Nm=8, respectively. 
This provides opportunity for hybridization between migrants while still allowing us to evaluate 
the effect of an order of magnitude difference in propagule pressure. After dispersal, aging 
occurred, which removed the adults from each patch and converted the offspring into adults for 
the next non-overlapping generation. Population regulation then followed, randomly culling the 
number of new adult individuals in each patch that exceeded the carrying capacity.  
 
Selection and genetic architecture 
Selection acted on offspring survivorship, with an individual’s fitness modeled as its survival 
probability before aging and reproduction. Stabilizing selection acted on the phenotype of both 
quantitative traits within each patch. Trait fitness Wt was defined by the standard Gaussian

assume w2 to be 7.5 given a heritability h2 ≈ 1/3 and environmental variance (VE) of one. These

We simulated quantitative traits under four baseline schemes of genetic architecture 
characterized by the number of loci (1, 10, 100, and 1000 loci), assuming free recombination, no 
pleiotropic effects, and additive alleles. We then modified these baseline architectures in 
subsequent analyses to include variations in linkage and epistasis (Table 1). Mutations acted in a 
stepwise fashion where the effect of a new mutation was added to the previous allelic value. The 
variance of the discretized normal distribution from which mutational effects were drawn was 
scaled by the number of loci underlying the trait (Table 1), such that the effect size of mutations 
generated during the burn-in period depended upon the model being tested (i.e., few mutations of 
large effect for architectures with fewer loci and many mutations of small effect for architectures 
with many loci). We compared mutation rates of µ=10-3, µ=10-4, µ=10-5, and µ=10-6 in order to 
evaluate the effect of differing values of Vg within source populations on colonization success 
(Supplemental Figure 1). We then narrowed this range to µ=10-4 and µ=10-5 for baseline 
simulations given that these rates bracketed an inflection point in the capacity for adaptation 
when genetic swamping was strong, consistent with Yeaman (2015). In order to prevent 
adaptation from mutation during the colonization phase, we only allowed mutation during the 
burn-in period.

Analysis 
We measured lag phase duration as the number of generations between the initiation of 
dispersal into the sink (transient occupancy) and the time at which carrying capacity in the sink 
was reached (permanent residency). We used mean genotypic value, G, as a metric to track 
adaptation within the sink population during the colonization phase. It was calculated as 𝐺=

Given that mutation was not allowed during the colonization phase, sampling the entirety of 
both source populations at the end of the burn-in period allowed us to determine the origin of 
every allele in the metapopulation. However, due to the finite number of possible allele effect 
sizes at each locus (255), there was a small chance that the same allele could be present in both 
source populations at the end of the burn-in. These identical alleles were ignored. Using these 
data, we characterized the genetic architecture of adaptation to the sink by measuring the 
frequency, effect size, and origin of each adaptive allele within the sink immediately after the lag 
phase. To be included in the analysis, we required an adaptive allele to have a frequency greater 
than a dispersal-dependent threshold, calculated as the maximum frequency of a new migrant 
allele entering the sink from one of the two source populations,

where f is fecundity and d is dispersal rate. Since Nsource and Nsink are both K after the lag phase 
and f is assumed to have a mean of four throughout all simulations, this simplifies to 4d.  
We then quantified the relative impact of each of the adaptive alleles in the sink by taking the 
product of the allele’s frequency and effect size, a quantity we refer to as the weight of an allele. 
By summing the weights of adaptive alleles originating from each source population, we were 
able to estimate the relative contribution of each source population to adaptation in the sink. 
When adaptation in the sink proceeds primarily by the recovery of parental genotypes, this is 
reflected by the total weight of adaptive alleles being primarily from one source. By contrast, 
when adaptation is achieved through the generation of hybrid genotypes, the contribution from 
the two source populations is more even. All analyses were averaged across 100 simulation 
replicates for each scheme of genetic architecture. Analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were then

Results 
The ‘when’ and the ‘how’ of hybrid colonization 
In order to test the architecture hypothesis of hybrid invasion, we first focused on its 
primary underlying prediction: colonization lag phase duration is sensitive to the genetic 
architecture of invasiveness traits. Lag phase duration for the four baseline schemes of genetic 
architecture (1, 10, 100, or 1000 loci, assuming free recombination and additivity within and  
between loci) varied with the magnitude of the differences between patch optima (DZopt), the 
mutation rate during the burn-in period (which in turn affected the starting values of Vg in the 
source populations), and the dispersal rate (Figure 2). In mild environments, which we define as 
having a relatively small DZopt of 6, mean colonization lag phase was on the order of ten 
generations for all genetic architectures and all parameter values, and thus did not differ between 
architectures. The lag phase when colonizing moderate environments (DZopt=8) varied depending 
on the genetic architecture and other assumptions of the model (Figure 3A). In more extreme 
environments (DZopt=10), 1-locus architectures were capable of colonizing the sink but all other 
architectures failed (i.e., the lag phase exceeded 500 generations) for the parameter values we 
tested. For subsequent analyses, we use DZopt=8, since for that parameter value, all genetic 
architectures showed some sensitivity to the other parameters.   
Overall, the lag phase was shorter for the 1-locus simulations compared to all other 
architectures under all parameter values tested. For architectures with many loci, a low burn-in 
mutation rate produced longer lag phases and, when combined with high dispersal rate, resulted

in a failure to colonize the sink during colonization phase. A significant three-way interaction 
was found between the number of loci, the dispersal rate, and the mutation rate (Table 2). In 
order to analyze the underlying factors contributing to this interaction, simple second-order 
interactions were analyzed by performing two-way ANOVAs between each pair of factors (loci, 
µ and d) at each level of the third factor (Table 3). Significant simple second-order interactions 
were found between mutation and dispersal for 100 and 1000 loci, between loci and dispersal at 
µ=10-5 (Figure 2B), and between loci and mutation at both levels of dispersal.  For all 
architectures, lag phase duration closely corresponded with the timing of adaptation to the sink, 
as shown for the case of high mutation and dispersal rates in Figure 3B.

In addition to quantitatively affecting the duration of the lag phase, the different genetic 
architectures led to qualitatively different modes of adaptation to the sink (Figure 3C). We 
analyzed the genetic architecture of adaptation under high mutation and dispersal rates, since the 
lag phase duration was minimized with these parameter values for all genetic architectures. For 
the 1-locus and 10-locus simulations, adaptation to the sink was based on the same alleles that 
contributed to adaptation in the source populations. Specifically, 100% of alleles contributing to 
adaptation in the sink originated from their respective adapted source population for 1-locus 
architectures. For 10-locus simulations, the mean contribution across replicates was 98.2% for 
both traits. In contrast, adaptation to the sink for 100-loci and 1000-loci architectures proceeded 
predominantly by the generation of novel hybrid genotypes. For 100-loci, the mean contribution 
of adaptive alleles originating from source population one was 33.1% for trait one and 67.1% for 
trait two. For 1000-loci, the mean contribution from source population one was 45.3% for trait

one and 54.5% for trait two. Thus, two modes of adaptation in the sink are observed; the 
recovery of parental genotypes as seen for 1 and 10-locus architectures, and the generation of 
hybrid genotypes for 100 and 1000-loci architectures.

Linkage 
Above, we have assumed free recombination between all loci and additive contributions to 
phenotype for the sake of simplicity, but both linkage and epistasis may influence adaptation in 
newly formed hybrid populations (Abbott et al., 2013; Harrison and Larson, 2014; Simon et al., 
2018; Yeaman and Whitlock, 2011). Linkage between loci reduces the recombination rate, and 
therefore may reduce the strength of genetic swamping when there are many loci (Tigano and 
Friesen, 2016). Since genetic swamping from source populations appears to be the force that 
impeded colonization for 100-loci and 1000-loci architectures when the burn-in mutation rate 
was low, we hypothesized that linkage among the loci within each adaptive trait could rescue 
these architectures under such conditions. To test this hypothesis, we incorporated varying 
degrees of within-trait linkage into 10, 100, and 1000 locus architectures (Table 1). All loci for 
each trait were clustered within either one or ten linkage groups 100 cM in length. Loci were 
spaced at 1 cM intervals in all cases except that of 1000 loci on a single linkage group, in which 
spacing was 0.1 cM.  Importantly, there was free recombination between the loci of the two 
different traits in these simulations.  
In order to evaluate the effect of selective interference between traits on lag phase duration, 
we then simulated linkage between the loci of the two different traits for 10 and 100-locus 
architectures. First, we tested the effects of between-trait linkage alone by placing pairs of loci, 
one for each trait, at a distance of 1 cM or 10 cM away from one another on each chromosome. 
Thus, there were 10 and 100 chromosomes for 10 and 100-locus architectures, respectively. In 
this way, we simulated linkage between the loci of the two different traits while preventing

linkage among loci of the same trait. We then evaluated the combined effects of within-trait 
linkage and between-trait linkage by simulating 10 and 100-locus architectures in which all loci 
for both traits were interleaved at 0.5 cM intervals on a single 100 cM chromosome. These 
simulations were run under conditions of a low burn-in mutation rate (µ=10-5) and high rate of 
dispersal (d=10-2). 
Incorporating within-trait linkage rescued the 100-loci and 1000-loci architectures, with 
one locag group resulting in shorter lag phases than ten (Figure 4A). Within-trait linkage also 
resulted in a shift in the mode of adaptation away from the generation of novel hybrid genotypes 
and towards the recovery of parental genotypes (Figure 4B). Between-trait linkage alone (ie. 
without within-trait linkage) resulted in 100% of replicates failing to colonize the sink for 10-
locus architectures. For 100-locus architectures, the percentage of replicates which failed to 
colonize the sink increased from 2% in baseline simulations to 9% and 14% for 1 cM and 10 cM 
simulations, respectively. For interleaved architectures, with both between-trait and within-trait 
linkage, 98% and 80% of replicates failed to colonize the sink for 10-locus and 100-locus 
architectures, respectively.

Epistasis  
Epistasis may influence adaptation in a hybrid zone by creating novel interactions between 
divergent migrant genotypes. If epistatic interactions are favored by selection, epistasis may 
result in shorter lag phases and a shift in the mode of adaptation to the generation of novel 
genotypes. While if such interactions are disfavored, lag phase duration may be lengthened while 
parental genotypes are recovered. In order to test these predictions, we incorporated epistasis into 
the model such that the genotype of an individual was determined by the combination of the 
additive effects of all alleles and an epistatic effect unique to each multilocus genotype. The 
genotypic value of an individual G was computed as 𝐺= 𝜖+ ∑
𝐺;
TUDVW;
;=>
 where ϵ represents the 
epistatic effect of the individuals genotype, and Gi represents the additive effect of locus i. The 
epistatic effect for each unique multilocus genotype was drawn from a discretized normal 
distribution, and we tested a range of variances of that distribution (Vϵ=0.05, 0.5, 2.25). The 
lowest value in this range reflects the variance of the distribution from which mutation effects 
were drawn for baseline 10-locus simulations, the middle value represented that base variance 
multiplied by the ten loci, and the highest value represented that base variance multiplied by the 
number of pairwise combinations between ten loci. We constrained our test of epistasis to ten 
locus simulations because computing the epistatic effects for 100- and 1000-loci simulations was 
not computationally feasible. For the same reason, we also limited the maximum number of 
alleles at each locus to 55, the minimum value possible within quantiNemo2. We assumed the

lower burn-in mutation rate and the higher dispersal rate, since these were the conditions for 
which there was strong genetic swamping in previous simulations. 
Overall, the inclusion of epistasis resulted in a greater percentage of replicates that failed to 
colonize the sink: 11%, 33%, and 19% of replicates for Vϵ=0.05, 0.5, 2.25, respectively, in 
comparison to 1% for the baseline architecture without epistasis. Incorporating epistasis resulted 
in significantly greater variance in colonization lag phase (s2=2.3e4, 4.3e4, and 3.4e4) for 
Vϵ=0.05, 0.5, and 2.25 respectively) compared to the baseline architecture (s2=5.4e3) (Table 4, 
Figure 5A). Given the heterogeneity of variance, Games-Howell post hoc tests were performed 
to compare the means. Lag phase duration did not differ significantly among the nonzero values 
of Vϵ, but mean lag phase duration was significantly longer for the two highest values of Vϵ=0.5 
and Vϵ=2.25 in comparison to the baseline architecture without epistasis (Table 4). We did not 
observe a shift in the mode of adaptation for those replicates that did succeed in colonizing the 
sink (Figure 5B).

Introgression vs. transgressive segregation 
So far, we have interrogated how genetic architecture may influence the timing of 
colonization and mode of adaptation by hybrid populations, but we have not considered post-
colonization range expansion and evolution. In section 3.1, we observed two primary, and 
mutually exclusive, modes of adaptation to the sink: either the recovery of parental genotypes 
within a trait (as seen for 1- and 10-locus architectures) or the generation of hybrid genotypes (as 
seen for 100- and 1000-locus architectures). Since we assumed additive contributions to the 
genotypic value for those baseline simulations, we can infer that complementary gene action 
explains the presence of adaptive alleles from both sources for 100- and 1000-locus 
architectures. We use complementary gene action here in the sense of alleles from different 
parents that share the same direction of effect being combined into a multilocus genotype

(Rieseberg et al., 1999). This leads us to predict that, for 100 and 1000-locus architectures, but 
not for 1 and 10-locus architectures, hybrid populations will be capable of further adaptation to 
optima exceeding that of either source patch. 
 
In order to test this prediction, we conducted simulations in which an additional patch (a 
secondary sink) was added adjacent to the primary sink with an environmental optimum twice 
that of the primary sink for each trait (Figure 1, DZopt=16 for the secondary sink). We allowed 
one-way dispersal from the primary to the secondary sink. We then monitored colonization and 
adaptation to the secondary sink by tracking occupancy and mean genotypic value over time. 
Since mutation was prohibited during the colonization phase, a hybrid population capable of 
adapting to the extreme optima of the secondary sink would necessarily do so via transgressive 
segregation of standing variation. We tested baseline architectures in the absence of linkage 
assuming a high burn-in mutation rate (µ=10-4) and high dispersal rate (d=10-2), since these 
parameters yielded the shortest lag phases across all architectures in section 3.1. 
In agreement with our prediction, we found that the 100-locus and 1000-locus architectures 
were capable of colonizing the secondary sink while the 1-locus and 10-locus architectures were 
unable to do so, and that colonization of the secondary sink corresponded with adaptation to its 
extreme optima (Figure 6).

The amount of transgressive segregation due to complementary gene action may relate to 
divergence, with increasing complementation resulting from the accumulation of fixed 
differences between populations over time (Bock et al., 2015; Rieseberg et al., 1999). Increased 
divergence may therefore reduce the colonization lag phase for architectures that rely on 
transgressive segregation (e.g., 100-locus architectures), whereas it may not influence the lag 
phase for architectures that rely on adaptive introgression (e.g., 10-locus architectures). We 
tested the effect of divergence on colonization lag phase by extending the burn-in period from 
10,000 generations to 20,000 or 50,000 generations for baseline 10 and 100-locus architectures 
with a low burn-in mutation rate (µ=10-5) and a low dispersal rate (d=10-3).  As predicted, 
increasing the burn-in period resulted in a slight increase in complementation and a reduction in 
the mean lag phase duration for 100-locus architectures, but had little effect on 10-locus 
architectures (Figure 7).

Given that large effect alleles are predicted to be more resistant to genetic swamping than 
small effect alleles (Tigano and Friesen, 2016; Yeaman and Whitlock, 2011), the consequences 
of increasing the burn-in time might be due, at least in part, to allowing time for larger-effect 
mutations to arise. In order to evaluate the role of effect size on its own, we increased the 
variance of the mutational effect sizes (allelic variance) for 100-locus architectures to match that 
of baseline 10-locus architectures (Table 1). The larger effect size resulted in increased 
complementation and a corresponding reduction in the mean lag phase duration for 100-locus 
architectures (Figure 7). However, lag phase duration was still shorter for 10-locus architectures 
with the same allelic variance (Figure 7A).

The steady accumulation of examples of colonization and invasion by hybrid populations 
in recent decades (Ellstrand and Schierenbeck, 2000; Schierenbeck and Ellstrand, 2008) has 
made it a priority in the field of invasion genetics to understand the genetic factors underpinning 
the contribution of hybridization to colonization (Bock et al., 2015). It is now understood that 
hybridization can contribute to colonization by producing an overall increase in standing genetic 
variation, the transfer of adaptive alleles between genetic backgrounds (adaptive introgression), 
and/or the production of novel genotypes in hybrids (transgressive segregation) (Pfennig et al., 
2016).  
Our aim here was to test, using individual based simulations, how the architecture of 
invasiveness traits can influence the contribution of hybridization to colonization. We focused on 
two underlying predictions: (1) that colonization lag phase duration would be sensitive to genetic 
architecture and (2) that architectures resistant to genetic swamping would produce shorter lag 
phases. Given our results, we then tested an additional prediction that the filtering effect of 
colonization on genetic architecture would influence the ability of resulting colonist populations 
to occupy and adapt to more extreme environments. 
We found two distinct categories of genetic architecture that facilitate rapid colonization by 
hybrid populations, doing so in fundamentally different ways. The first category included 
architectures with few loci and/or tightly linked loci. The mode of adaptation observed for such 
architectures was the recovery of adaptive parental genotypes. Because this pattern is akin to 
adaptive introgression, we refer to this as an ‘adaptive introgression-type architecture’. The 
second category included architectures with many freely recombining loci (no within-trait 
linkage or between-trait linkage) and high Vg, in which the mode of adaptation was the

generation of novel hybrid genotypes. Because this second pattern is more akin to transgressive 
segregation, we refer to this as a ‘transgressive segregation-type architecture’.  
We found that the extremes within these categories produced the shortest lag phases, with a 
single locus or a single linkage group producing shorter lag phases than 10 loci or 10 linkage 
groups for ‘adaptive introgression’-type architectures, and 1000 loci producing shorter lag phases 
than 100 loci for ‘transgressive segregation’-type architectures. We conclude that lag phase 
duration is predominantly driven by the number of loci underlying a trait, modulated by their 
position within the genome and effect size of alleles. These results support our first prediction 
that lag phase duration is sensitive to the genetic architecture of invasiveness traits.  
The second prediction, that genetic architectures resistant to genetic swamping produce 
shorter lag phases, is supported by two lines of evidence. First, when Vg in the source 
populations was high (burn-in µ=10-4), architectures with many freely recombining loci 
succeeded in colonization at both low and high dispersal rates, but when Vg in source populations 
was low (burn-in µ=10-5), increased dispersal resulted in colonization failure across all 
replicates. The increase in lag duration with increased dispersal suggests that the establishment 
of adaptive genotypes was hindered by a greater influx of maladaptive alleles. This is consistent 
with previous studies of adaptation across clines that have shown that such architectures are 
vulnerable to genetic swamping (Yeaman and Otto, 2011; Yeaman and Whitlock, 2011). Our 
observation that high Vg counteracted increased dispersal, and in fact reduced lag phase 
significantly for 1000-locus architectures, is consistent with Yeaman (2015), who found that the 
effects of genetic swamping may be mitigated by sufficiently high Vg for architectures dominated 
by alleles of small effect. Our model demonstrates that this mitigating effect of Vg on the strength

of genetic swamping can significantly reduce lag phase duration for hybrid invasions with such 
architectures.  
The second line of evidence supporting the prediction that genetic architectures resistant to 
genetic swamping produce shorter lag phases is that incorporating within-trait linkage rescued 
some simulations in which colonization would otherwise fail. In particular, for the many-locus 
architectures, when Vg was low and dispersal was high, colonization failed in the case of free 
recombination but succeeded in the presence of within-trait linkage as long as between-trait 
linkage was absent.  Incorporating within-trait linkage also resulted in a corresponding shift in 
the mode of adaptation towards the recovery of parental genotypes. This suggests that by 
reducing recombination between loci, linkage facilitates the recovery of adaptive parental 
haplotypes despite a steady influx of maladaptive migrant alleles, which is consistent with 
previous research demonstrating that linkage mitigates the effects of genetic swamping in 
hybridizing populations (Yeaman and Whitlock, 2011).  
A consequence of the longer lag phases observed for architectures prone to swamping is that 
colonization of the sink often failed to occur within our limited window of observation. For 
instance, many-locus architectures failed to colonize the sink when Vg was low and dispersal was 
high.  This suggests that these architectures may be under-represented among those contributing 
to successful hybrid invasions, particularly for recent introductions and organisms with long 
generation times, because the time since introduction would often be too short. Our results also 
suggest that, for those hybrid invasions that are successful, invasion-related traits would be 
enriched for ‘adaptive introgression’-type architectures, since these facilitate rapid colonization 
across the widest range of parameter space.

Strong epistatic interactions may, on average, hinder colonization despite accelerating it in 
some instances. For 10-locus architectures, we found that the inclusion of epistasis produced 
greater variance in colonization lag phase and a greater percentage of replicates that failed to 
colonize the sink. Lag phase was significantly longer when epistatic variance was high in 
comparison to baseline architectures without epistasis. Interestingly, epistasis had no observable 
effect on the mode of adaptation to the sink. Further study will be needed to determine if these 
findings can be generalized to architectures with more loci.   
Our results point to an interesting a tradeoff between the modes of adaptation associated with 
the two extremes of swamping-resistant architectures. ‘Adaptive introgression’-type 
architectures produce the shortest invasion lag phases across the widest range of parameter 
space, with 1-locus and single linkage group architectures producing lags with mean duration on 
the order of ten generations (Figures 2 and 4). Such a capacity to rapidly colonize environments 
within the bounds of parental trait values may result in initial invasions that spread rapidly. 
However, such architectures necessarily limit adaptive traits to those that can be obtained by 
reconstituting parental genotypes, and further adaptation to novel environments beyond the 
bounds of parental phenotypes may be mutation-limited (Figure 6). By contrast, ‘transgressive 
segregation’-type architectures produce relatively longer lag phases and fail to colonize the sink 
under some conditions of Vg and dispersal. Once established, however, these hybrid populations 
demonstrate a capacity to adapt to environmental conditions beyond the range of parental 
populations. Transgressive segregation-type architectures thus may facilitate invasions that can 
spread into a wider variety of novel habitats (Figure 6).  
Another difference between the genetic architectures is in their sensitivity to linkage between 
traits. In general, we found that selective interference between traits hindered colonization, but

that its effect was more pronounced for adaptive introgression-type architectures than 
transgressive segregation-type architectures.  
As noted recently by Marques et al. (2019), admixture-derived large-effect haplotypes and 
the generation of novel genotypes via transgressive segregation are may be frequent sources of 
adaptive variation for speciation and adaptive radiation. While our simulations do not interrogate 
the contribution of admixture variation to reproductive isolation per se, the colonization of novel 
or extreme environments by hybrids can promote ecological differentiation between hybrid and 
parental populations, which in turn fosters conditions favorable for speciation and adaptive 
radiation (Abbott et al., 2013; Seehausen, 2004). Given our finding that only successful hybrid 
colonists with ‘transgressive segregation’-type architectures were capable of further colonization 
and adaptation to more extreme environments, we would predict that such colonists are more 
likely to generate new hybrid species and adaptive radiations than those with ‘adaptive 
introgression’-type architectures.  
We recognize that the model we present is a crude representation of the complexity of a 
hybrid invasion, and we have made many simplifying assumptions in order to focus on the role 
of genetic architecture. For one, we have simulated two source populations with identical 
population sizes and dispersal pressure into the sink. The demographic histories and extent of 
gene flow will generally differ between hybridizing populations. The symmetric hybridization 
scheme such as the one we have explored would be expected to produce the shortest possible lag 
times given that variation from both source populations is required for adaptation in both traits 
and that the two traits are of equal importance to fitness. Additionally, hybridization may shift 
from being beneficial at the establishment phase to maladaptive when persistent migration occurs 
between core and peripheral populations (García‐Ramos and Kirkpatrick, 1997). We explore the

effect of genetic swamping during the establishment phase alone, but it is likely to be a persistent 
force which shapes the adaptive trait architecture of hybrid colonists throughout invasion.  
Second, we assume the two source populations are recently diverged. Divergence may 
influence the contribution of hybridization to colonization in at least two ways. As observed for 
transgressive segregation-type architectures, increased divergence may increase complementary 
gene action and provide the allelic variation necessary to generate successful novel genotypes in 
hybrids. Thus, at least for the relatively short divergence times we tested, colonization success 
appears to increase with increased divergence for transgressive segregation-type architectures. 
However, increased divergence may also lead to the accumulation of genetic incompatibilities 
(ie. Dobzhansky-Muller Incompatibilities or DMIs) between the source populations. DMIs are 
known to influence the genomic landscape of introgression (Comeault, 2018; Harrison and 
Larson, 2014), and undoubtedly play an important role in determining when and how 
hybridization contributes to colonization success. We do not include the evolution of DMIs in 
our model, and therefore we chose to limit our burn-in period to a timeframe relevant to recently 
diverged taxa in which DMIs would be less likely to be observed. Models involving longer 
periods of isolation and the evolution of DMIs will be necessary to comprehensively evaluate the 
influence of divergence on the contribution of hybridization to colonization.  
A third assumption is that we can consider the two traits of interest in isolation from other 
traits not directly related to colonization. Empirical evidence does suggest that range expansions 
may commonly involve relatively few adaptive traits (Bock et al., 2015), but it may be important 
to consider both interference between those traits – as we have done – and, especially in hybrids, 
other traits under selection in the hybrids. With many segregating polymorphisms under 
selection, there is considerable opportunity for selective interference (Comeron and Kreitman, 
.

2002; McVean and Charlesworth, 2000), which could delay or prevent adaptation to a novel 
environment.  In a hybrid, segregating loci with formerly fixed differences, affecting traits 
unrelated to colonization per se, may also be newly visible to selection. Thus, not only does 
selective interference between loci from the two different traits potentially hinder colonization, 
but this would be exacerbated in a more realistic scenario with many more traits segregating for 
genetic variation in the hybrids.  
A fourth assumption is that new mutations do not accumulate during the colonization phase 
and thus do not contribute to colonization of the sink. Range expansion stemming from de novo 
mutation has been thoroughly studied theoretically (Gilbert and Whitlock, 2017; Gomulkiewicz 
et al., 1999; Holt et al., 2003; Kirkpatrick and Barton, 1997), and could feasibly contribute to 
adaptation within novel environments on timescales relevant for contemporary invasions (Bock 
et al., 2015; Dlugosch et al., 2015). Moreover, the time required for beneficial mutations to 
accumulate is another potential genetic cause of invasion lag phases (Crooks and Soulé, 1999; 
Holt et al., 2003). In reality, hybrid invasions may involve adaptations arising from a 
combination of mutation and gene flow, and our model only focuses on the latter. 
A final assumption is that the lag phase is limited only by local adaptation. Although this was 
a necessary assumption in order to interrogate the potential role of genetic architecture on lag 
phase duration, there are other factors that could contribute to the invasion lag phase. These 
include overcoming Allee effects (Aikio et al., 2010), the time to reach sexual maturity (Wangen 
and Webster, 2006), changes to the receiving environment (Crooks, 2005; Crooks and Soulé, 
1999), and, as discussed above, the accumulation of new mutations.  
Despite these simplifying assumptions, our results allow us to make a number of robust 
conclusions. Primarily, we demonstrate that genetic architecture can influence when and how

hybridization contributes to colonization. We find that two categories of swamping-resistant 
genetic architectures produce short colonization lag phases, and that they do so by qualitatively 
different modes of adaptation. We also find that there is a tradeoff between the two categories of 
colonist genetic architectures which may influence future adaptation to more extreme 
environments.
