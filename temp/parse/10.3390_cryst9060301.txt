Abstract: Phosphonate ligands demonstrate strong aﬃnity for metal ions. However, there are
several cases where the phosphonate is found non-coordinated to the metal ion. Such compounds
could be characterized as salts, since the interactions involved are ionic and hydrogen
bonding.
In this paper we explore a number of such examples, using divalent metal
ions (Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+ and Ni2+) and the phosphonic acids:
p-aminobenzylphosphonic
acid
(H2PABPA),
tetramethylenediamine-tetrakis(methylenephosphonic
acid)
(H8TDTMP),
and 1,2-ethylenediphosphonic acid (H4EDPA). The compounds isolated and structurally
characterized are [Mg(H2O)6]·[HPABPA]2·6H2O, [Ca(H2O)8]·[HPABPA]2, [Sr(H2O)8]·[HPABPA]2,
[Mg(H2O)6]·[H6TDTMP], and [Ni(H2O)6]·[H2EDPA]·H2O. Also,
the coordination polymer
{[Ni(4,4’-bpy)(H2O)4]·[H2EDPA]·H2O}n was synthesized and characterized, which contains a bridging
4,4’-bipyridine (4,4’-bpy) ligand forming an inﬁnite chain with the Ni2+ cations. All these compounds
contain the phosphonate anion as the counterion to charge balance the cationic charge originating
from the metal cation.
Keywords: metal phosphonate; ionic compounds; phosphonic acids; organic salts
1. Introduction
The area of metal phosphonate chemistry has seen impressive growth in the last decade [1]. Metal
phosphonate compounds are known for their complex and diverse structural motifs [2] and their
unique structural topologies [3]. They are also candidates for use in versatile application areas such as
proton conductivity [4], gas storage [5], pharmacology [6], ion-exchange [7], catalysis [8] and corrosion
inhibition [9].
The phosphonate group, either mono-deprotonated (-PO3H−), or doubly-deprotonated (-PO32−),
demonstrates high aﬃnity for metal ions [10]. Because of this, and the stability of the metal phosphonate
coordination bonds, hybrid metal organic materials with non-coordinated phosphonate groups (Ionic

Metal-Phosphonates), are relatively scarce. However, notable examples are found in the literature,
and are brieﬂy presented below.
The hydrated salt [Co(NH3)6](O3P(C6H4)2COO)·4H2O was crystallized from an aqueous
ammonia solution of 4-phosphono-biphenyl-4’-carboxylic acid [11].
In a similar approach,
4-phosphonobenzoic acid was crystallized with hexaaquacobalt(II) [12].
The compound
[Cd2Cl4(H2O)6]0.5[H4L] [L = 2-morpholinoethyliminobis(methylenephosphonic acid)] contains
a Cd chlorodimer as the cationic moiety [13].
The salt [Ni(phen)3](H7L2)0.5(H5L2)0.5·2H2O
(phen = 1,10-phenanthroline,
L = hydroxyethylidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid) showed two
forms of the ligand in the same structure, with diﬀerent degrees of deprotonation [14].
A series of divalent transition metal phosphonates containing hydrogen-bonded layers of
phenylphosphonate anions, namely [M(phen)3]·C6H5PO3·11H2O [M = Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+] and
[Cd(phen)3]·C6H5PO3H·Cl·7H2O were synthesized and structurally characterized by single-crystal
X-ray diﬀraction methods [15].
The synthesis and crystal structures of ﬁve new analogues
of the supramolecular copper(II) arylphosphonate [Cu(phen)2Cl][(C6H5PO3H2)(HO3PC6H5)]
were
reported.
The
structures
contain
substituted
phenylphosphonic
acids,
and
are
of
the
general
formula
[Cu(phen)2Cl][(XPO3H2)(HO3PX)]·Z,
where
X
=
o-CH3(C6H4);
X = p-CH3(C6H4), Z = H2O·2CH3CH2OH; X = o-NO2(C6H4), m-NO2(C6H4); X = m-NO2(C6H4);
X = C10H7 [16]. The salt [Mg1.5(H2O)9]·(L-H2)1.5·6H2O (L-H2 = O3PCH2N(H)(C4H8)N(H)CH2PO3,
N,N′-piperazine-bis(methylenephosphonic acid) was hydrothermally synthesized and structurally
characterized [17].
The crystal structure of the zinc hexaaqua compound [Zn(H2O)6][TDTMP]
(TDTMP = tetramethylenediamine-tetrakis(methylenephosphonate)) was reported [18]. Alkaline-earth
metal phosphates containing nitrogen-donor ligands were prepared by the reaction of alkaline-earth
metal acetates M(OAc)2·xH2O (M = Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba) with 2,6-diisopropylphenylphosphate (dippH2).
Interaction of strontium or barium acetate with dippH2 in methanol at room temperature leads to
the isolation of ionic phosphates [{M2(µ-H2O)4(H2O)10}{dipp}2]·4L [M = Sr, L = CH3OH; M = Ba,
L = H2O] [19]. The structure of the compound bis(hydrogen diphenylmethylphosphonato)-magnesium
octahydrate contains polar and non-polar layers.
The polar layers contain Mg(H2O)62+ ions,
water of hydration and the phosphonate O atoms, and the non-polar layers contain benzhydryl
groups.
Two-dimensional hydrogen-bonding networks link Mg(H2O)62+ and the water of
hydration to the phosphonate O atoms [20].
Three 1D nickel coordination polymers based
on P,P’-diphenylethylenediphosphinic acid and three diﬀerent bis-pyridine co-ligands, namely
4,4’-bipyridine, 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane and 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane, were prepared in mild
hydrothermal conditions.
They all contained 1D “Ni-bipyridyl” chains, with the phosphinate
playing the role of the counterion [21]. The synthesis and crystal structure of Mg(2-AEPH)2·8H2O
(2-AEPH = 2-aminoethylphosphonate) were reported [22]. The compound is built from octahedral
magnesium hexaaqua dications, uncoordinated 2-AEPH- anions, and interstitial water molecules.
The latter have no metal contacts but are engaged in hydrogen bonding, in which the water molecules,
the (protonated) amino functions and the O-acceptor sites of the anions participate. The structures of
the alkaline earth metal (Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba) complexes with (4-aminophenyl)arsonic acid (p-arsanilic
acid) have been determined [23]. Of these, only the Mg analog, hexaaquamagnesium bis[hydrogen
(4-aminophenyl)arsonate] tetrahydrate, [Mg(H2O)6](C6H7AsNO3)·4H2O, is ionic. The octahedral
[Mg(H2O)6]2+ cation, the two hydrogen p-arsanilate anions and the four water molecules of solvation
form a three-dimensional network structure through inter-species O—H and N—H hydrogen-bonding
interactions with water and arsonate O-atom and amine N-atom acceptors.
In this study we present the synthesis and structural characterization of ﬁve novel ionic metal
phosphonates containing divalent metal ions, such as alkaline-earth metals (M = Mg2+, Ca2+,
Sr2+) and the 3D transition metal Ni2+. The alkaline-earth metal compounds contain the aromatic
amino-phosphonate ligand p-aminobenzylphosphonic acid (H2PABPA), or the tetraphosphonic acid
ligand tetramethylenediamine-tetrakis(methylenephosphonic acid) (H8TDTMP) (when M = Mg2+).
The two Ni2+-containing compounds both contain the ligand 1,2-ethylenediphosphonic acid (EDPA),
Crystals 2019, 9, 301

but one of them also contains the bridging co-ligand 4,4’-bipyridine. The latter is a Ni-4,4’-bipyridine
coordination polymer having the EDPA as the counterion. Schematic structures of the ligand used
herein are presented in Figure 1.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Instrumentation
1H, 31P{1H} NMR spectra were recorded on a Jeol JNM-ECZ 400S Research FT NMR spectrometer
(JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) operating at 400 MHz and 161.7 MHz for 1H and 31P nuclei, respectively.
ATR-IR spectra were collected on a Thermo-Electron NICOLET 6700 FTIR optical spectrometer (Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA). Elemental analyses (C, H, N) were measured on a Perkin–Elmer
2400 analyzer (Perkin–Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data were
recorded on an SDT-Q600 analyzer from TA instruments (TA instruments, New Castle, DE, USA).
The temperature varied from RT to 900 ◦C at a heating rate of 10 ◦C·min−1. Measurements were carried
out on samples in open platinum crucibles under air ﬂow.
2.2. General
Starting materials were of reagent grade purity, obtained from commercial sources, and used
without further puriﬁcation. Deionized (DI) water was puriﬁed by a cation-exchange column.
2.3. Synthesis of 4-(bromomethyl)nitrobenzene
A 100 mL ﬂask was charged with 4-(hydroxymethyl)nitrobenzene (5.00 g, 0.0326 mol), and 30%
HBr solution in glacial acetic acid (35 mL). The obtained mixture was stirred at gentle reﬂux for 2 h.
After cooling down, 48% HBr solution in water (20 mL) was added in order to precipitate as much crude
4-(bromomethyl)nitrobenzene as possible. The obtained brownish solid was ﬁltered out, dissolved
in chloroform and passed through a thick plug of ﬁnely ground K2CO3, to remove acidic impurities

and residual water. After solvent evaporation, crude 4-(bromomethyl)nitrobenzene was crystallized
from hexanes aﬀording light beige crystals. Yield: 6.41 g (91%). Spectral data match those previously
reported [24]. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 8.20(d, 3JHH = 8.4Hz, 2H), 7.55 (d, 3JHH= 8.4Hz, 2H),
4.51 (s, 2H).
2.4. Synthesis of 4-(diethoxyphosphorylmethyl)nitrobenzene
A

inlet
was
charged
with
4-(bromomethyl)nitrobenzene (5.00 g, 0.0231 mol), and triethyl phosphite (10 mL, 0.0583 mol).
The mixture was heated to 120 ◦C under constant ﬂow of nitrogen. Ethyl bromide, which is a coproduct
of the Arbuzov reaction, was collected in the trap. After two hours of reaction the volatiles were
distilled oﬀunder reduced pressure at the same temperature. Dark orange-colored crude product was
subjected to column chromatography (silica gel, eluent: ethyl acetate, Rf = 0.40) yielding yellowish
oil. Yield: 5.63 g (89%). Spectral data matched those previously reported [25]. 1H NMR (400 MHz,
CDCl3): δ 8.24 (d, 3JHH = 8.7 Hz, 2H), 7.54 (dd, 3JHH = 8.7 Hz, 4JPH = 2.5 Hz, 2H), 3.93 (m, 4H), 3.30 (d,
2JPH = 22.4 Hz, 2H), 1.32 (t, 3JHH = 7.0 Hz, 6H). 31P{1H} NMR (161.7 MHz, CDCl3): δ 25.10 (s).
2.5. Synthesis of 4-(diethoxyphosphorylmethyl)aniline
This
procedure
is
an
adaptation
of
a
reduction
protocol
employed
for
the
synthesis
of
4-(diethoxyphosphoryl)aniline
[26].
A
250
mL
ﬂask
was
charged
with
4-(diethoxyphosphorylmethyl)nitrobenzene (4.80 g, 0.0175 mol), triethylamine (50 mL, 0.358 mol),
and 100 mg 10%Pd/C catalyst. The reaction mixture was preheated to 50 ◦C and 90% Formic acid (8 mL,
0.18 mol) was added in small portions. Note that the reaction is strongly exothermic, and that hydrogen
gas is evolved. After addition of all formic acid the reﬂux was maintained for 30 min, then the reaction
mixture was cooled down, and evaporated. The crude product was dissolved in chloroform (100 mL),
extracted with water (2 × 50 mL), and brine (50 mL). The organic phase was collected, dried with
K2CO3, and evaporated. Column chromatography (silica gel, eluent: ethyl acetate, Rf = 0.22) provided
pure 4-(diethoxyphosphorylmethyl)aniline as a light yellow oil that crystallizes upon standing. Yield:
3.35 g (79%). Spectral data match those previously reported [27]. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ 7.05

4-(Diethoxyphosphorylmethyl)aniline (3.20 g, 0.0131 mol), concentrated hydrochloric acid (25 mL)
and water (25 mL) were mixed together in a 100 mL ﬂask. The obtained mixture was heated at reﬂux for
20 h. After hydrolysis the reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness. Crude product was boiled with
ethanol (30 mL) for 30 min, cooled down and left overnight. A beige precipitate was ﬁltered out and
dried, providing pure 4-(dihydroxyphosphorylmethyl)aniline. Yield: 2.19 g (89%). 1H NMR (400 MHz,

2.99 (d, 2JPH = 21.5 Hz, 2H). 31P{1H} NMR (161.7 MHz, D2O + D2SO4): δ 25.48 (s).
2.7. Synthesis of [Mg(H2O)6]·[HPABPA]2·6H2O (Mg-PABPA)
Solid H2PABPA (132 mg, 0.7 mmol) was added to 140 mL of deionized water in a 250 mL glass
beaker. A small quantity of 2 M NaOH solution was added until the pH of the solution reached
the value of ~12.0. The solution was then heated to 80 ◦C and stirred vigorously until all the solid
H2PABPA dissolved. The solution was left to reach room temperature and then a small amount of a
2 M HCl solution was added until the pH dropped to 7.7. In a separate glass beaker, a quantity of
MgCl2·6H2O (70 mg, 0.35 mmol) was dissolved in 70 mL of DI water. The two solutions were ﬁnally
transferred to a polypropylene vessel and mixed under vigorous stirring. The pH of the resulting
solution was adjusted to 7.0. This clear, colorless solution was left to stand at room temperature for

atop a glass ﬁber with cyanoacrylate glue, using a Bruker SMART APEX II diﬀractometer with
graphite-monochromated Mo-Kα radiation. Data for Mg-PABPA, Ca-PABPA, Sr-PABPA and Ni-EDPA
were collected with a Bruker D8 Venture diﬀractometer. The data were processed with the APEX3
suite [28]. The structures were solved by direct methods [29], which revealed the position of all
non-hydrogen atoms. These atoms were reﬁned on F2 by a full-matrix least squares procedure using
anisotropic displacement parameters [30]. All hydrogen atoms were located in diﬀerence Fourier maps
and included as ﬁxed contributions riding on attached atoms with isotropic thermal displacement
parameters 1.2 or 1.5 times those of the respective atom. Crystallographic data for the reported structures
have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center as supplementary publication
no. CCDC 1914866 – 1914868 and 1914870-1914872. Additional crystal data are shown in Table 1.

The structures of Ni-bpy-EDPA and Mg-TDTMP were solved by employing SHELXTL direct
methods and reﬁned by full-matrix least squares on F2, using the APEX2 software package [31].
All non-H atoms were reﬁned with independent anisotropic displacement parameters. Hydrogen
atoms were placed at calculated positions and reﬁned using a riding model, except for the water and
phosphonic acid O−H hydrogens, which were located from the Fourier diﬀerence density maps and
reﬁned using a riding model with O−H distance restraints. Crystallographic details are summarized
in Table 1.

level to obtain the distribution of the electronic density ρ of the ligands colored with the Molecular
Electrostatic Potential value. Partial charges for all phosphonic oxygen atoms were calculated using
the Mulliken [36] and Lowdin [37] Population Analysis. Comparison between the ligands that are used
in this study and the non-electron withdrawing group (EWG) analogues should show the deﬁciency
of electron density around the phosphonate groups as a result of the co-existence of the EWGs on
each molecule. Furthermore, to better mimic the experimental conditions, the Polarization Continuum
Model (PCM) [38] implied in GAMESS(US) [39,40] was used for all the calculations by adding solvent
eﬀects. The electronic densities were rendered using wxMacMolPlt [41]. The non EWGs analogs

used were ethylphosphonic acid (H2EPA) for H4EDPA and benzylphosphonic acid (H2BPA) for the
H2PABPA.
Computational Methodology. The starting geometries for all compounds except HPABPA1−were
created using the molecular editor Avogadro [42] (Version 1.2.0) and the Universal Force ﬁeld (UFF) [43].
The next step is the geometry reﬁnement and it was done on the B3LYP/6-31 + G*/PCM level using
GAMESS(US) [44–46]. The resulting energetically minimized structures were used for the electronic
structure calculations. Since the ligand HPABPA1−is found as a dimer in all crystal structures, we used
both the monomer and the dimer of HPABPA1−for all calculations. Therefore, for the starting geometry
of the dimer anion of the ligand, the (HPABPA1−)2 supramolecule was isolated from the CIF ﬁle of
the Sr-PABPA compound using the Avogadro software. This geometry was reﬁned at the B3LYP/6-31
+ G*/PCM level using GAMESS(US). The resulting, energetically minimized structure was used for
the electronic structure calculations. The geometry of the monomer of HPABPA1−was created using
Avogadro and the MMFF94 Molecular Force Field created by Merck [47]. The Geometry reﬁnement
and the electronic calculations were done at the same level of theory as for the rest compounds.
3. Results
3.1. Synthetic Considerations
One of the major factors aﬀecting metal phosphonate syntheses is pH [48]. In most cases, low
pH favors protonation of the phosphonate groups and drastically reduced aﬃnity for metal ions.
In contrast, high pH values cause deprotonation, high negative charge on the phosphonate and
rapid formation and precipitation of an amorphous metal phosphonate product. Hence, for each
metal/phosphonate system there is an optimum pH regime for crystalline product formation [49].
However, even if solution pH ensures electroneutrality, i.e., positive charge from the metal cation
equals the negative charge from the phosphonate ligand, the ligand can be found to be non-coordinated
(albeit deprotonated), acting simply as the counterion. The metal ion is commonly found bound by
water molecules in an aqua complex or coordinated by other ligands present in the system. Other
electron-withdrawing, or cationic moieties on the phosphonate ligand backbone may withdraw electron
density from the anionic phosphonate group, thus making it less nucleophilic.
The PABPA was found as the “free” anion in the structures of Mg-PABPA, Ca-PABPA,
and Sr-PABPA. The phosphonate moiety was found to be doubly-deprotonated, whereas the amine
group was protonated.
This renders the entire ligand monoanionic, hence each divalent metal
center requires two HPABPA ligands for charge balance. All metal centers were coordinated by
water molecules (six in the case of Mg, and eight in the case of Ca and Sr). In spite of the fact
that the phosphonate moiety was doubly deprotonated, it remained non-coordinated, apparently
due to the decrease in its negative charge because of the –NH3+ group (this aspect is analyzed
in the DFT calculations section, vide infra). In this case, water as a ligand was stronger than the
phosphonate oxygens.
A similar situation was seen for the H6TDTMP2−tetraphosphonate ligand in Mg-TDTMP. Here,
every phosphonate moiety was singly-deprotonated, whereas the N atom (a tertiary amine) was found
to be protonated. This is the common bis-anionic form of this ligand at the pH region 2–4 [50]. Again,
it is assumed that the NH+ moieties deplete the phosphonate moieties of anionic charge, thus making
them less nucleophilic.
In the H2EDPA2−ligand,
and in the salt Ni-EDPA, each phosphonate moiety was
singly-deprotonated, thus rendering the ligand a “2−” anion, balancing the “2+” charge of the
[Ni(H2O)6]2+ cation. In spite of the absence of any electron-withdrawing moieties in H2EDPA2−
it still remained non-coordinated in the Ni-EDPA salt. This has been observed before in the salt
[Ni(2,2’-bpy)(H2O)4]·[H2EDPA] [51]. Similarly, in the cationic coordination polymer Ni-bpy-EDPA
the Ni2+ center was coordinated by four water molecules at equatorial positions, whereas the axial
positions were occupied by the N atom of the bridging 4,4’-bpy ligand, leaving the H2EDPA2-
Crystals 2019, 9, 301

diphosphonate to play the role of the counterion for the cationic 1D chain. Here, the 4,4’-bpy ligand
displayed strong aﬃnity for the Ni2+ center, certainly stronger than the phosphonate oxygens.
3.2. Materials Characterization
Purity of all products was conﬁrmed by elemental analyses (CHN) and powder X-ray diﬀraction
(see Figures S1–S5, in the Supplementary Materials). In some cases (e.g., Mg-PABPA and Ni-EDPA)
additional peaks were identiﬁed in the XRD diagrams, indicating the presence of impurities, but all
our synthetic eﬀorts did not improve product purity.
ATR-IR spectra for all ligands and metal-containing compounds are given in Figure S6, in the
Supplementary Materials).
For phosphonate-containing materials the region 900–1100 cm−1 is
commonly used as a “ﬁngerprint” region, in order to conﬁrm changes in the environment of the
phosphonate group. Phosphonate bands appeared in this region due to a combination of bands
originating from P=O, P-OH and O-P-O vibrations, similar to other reported compounds [52].
For example, for the “free” ligand H2PABPA bands assigned to the –PO3 moiety appeared
at 933, 1064, and 1085 cm−1. In the Mg-PABPA compound bands appeared in the same region,
but at diﬀerent positions, namely at 968, 1004, 1058, and 1091 cm−1. The spectra of Ca-PABPA and
Sr-PABPA compounds (essentially identical, since these compounds are isostructural) showed the
bands assigned to the –PO3 moiety in the same region, as expected, but slightly shifted, at 953, 1028,
1061, and 1097 cm−1. In the spectra of the “free” ligand H2PABPA and Metal-PABPA compound,
the bands due to the aromatic ring were essentially identical. Similar observations can be made for the
“Nickel-EDPA” system. The “free” ligand H4EDPA showed bands for the –PO3 moiety at 921, 953, 993,
and 1014 cm−1. Spectra for the Ni-EDPA compound showed these bands slightly shifted, at 926, 996,
1029, and 1052 cm−1. Similarly, the Ni-bpy-EDPA compound showed very similar bands to those for
Ni-EDPA, in addition to the strong peaks assigned to the 4,4’-bpy ligand.
Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) revealed the thermal behavior of the compounds. For example,
Mg-PABPA (Figure S7 in Supplementary Materials) demonstrated a number of consecutive losses.
The ﬁrst one (~16.5%), starts almost at RT and is completed at ~100 ◦C. It corresponds to removal of
the lattice waters (six calculated, 5.6 found). The second loss (~16.0), starting thereafter was complete
at ~150 ◦C and corresponded to removal of the Mg-coordinated waters (six calculated, 5.5 found).
There were some additional small losses at temperatures above 200 ◦C, which might correspond to
the loss of ammonia from the ligand. Similar observations can be noted for Ca-PABPA (Figure S8
in Supplementary Materials). The diﬀerence here is that Ca-PABPA had no lattice water molecules.
Hence, the ﬁrst substantial loss (~23%) completed at ~100 ◦C corresponded to loss of the Ca-bound
waters, followed by some small additional losses that were tentatively assigned to loss of ammonia from
the ligand. Sr-PABPA (Figure S9 in Supplementary Materials) behaves similarly. Compound Ni-EDPA
(Figure S10 in Supplementary Materials) loses all its water molecules (six that are Ni-coordinated
and one in the lattice) in one single step (~37%) at ~200 ◦C. Similarly, Ni-bpy-EDPA (Figure S11 in
Supplementary Materials) showed a one-step loss (~30.3%) of all of its water molecules (four that are
Ni-coordinated and one in the lattice). Loss of water molecules will create coordination sites for the
phosphonate to bind, provided there is no ligand decomposition. As these phenomena are rather
complex, they will be studied in detail and reported in a future publication.
3.3. Crystallographic Description
The structure of Mg-PABPA can be described as a salt with [Mg(H2O)6]2+ being the cation and
two monoanionic HPABPA−ligands being the anions, see Figure 2a. Two HPABPA−ligands are
required for charge balance. There are numerous hydrogen bonds between Mg-bound water molecules,
lattice water molecules, the phosphonate moiety and the protonated amine group. The structure
(Figure 2b,c) is composed of layers of [Mg(H2O)6]2+ cations and layers of HPABPA−ligands that run
along the b axis. The orientation of the ligand was syn-anti, with the phosphonate groups sitting close
to the –NH3+ moieties. Lattice water molecules are situated in the vicinity of the Mg-OH2, -PO32−and

The salts Ca-PABPA and Sr-PABPA are isostructural, so only the former is discussed. The structure
of Ca-PABPA can be described as a salt of [Ca(H2O)8]2+ aqua complex cation and two monoanionic
HPABPA−anions, see Figure 3a. The Ca2+ center is coordinated by eight water molecules and is found
in a coordination environment best described as bicapped prism, see Figure 3b. In contrast to the
Mg-PABPA structure, there are no lattice water molecules in the lattice. The structure (Figure 3c) can
be described as being composed of layers of [Ca(H2O)8]2+ cations and layers of HPABPA−ligands that
run along the c axis. The orientation of the ligand is syn-anti, with the phosphonate groups sitting close
to the –NH3+ moieties. The -PO32−and –NH3+ moieties of the HPABPA−ligand form a multitude of
hydrogen bonds with the Ca-coordinated water molecules.

The structure of Mg-TDTMP can be described as a salt with [Mg(H2O)6]2+ being the cation and the
bis-dianionic H6TDTMP2−tetraphosphonate ligand being the anion, see Figure 4a. One H6TDTMP2−
ligand is required for charge balance. There are numerous hydrogen bonds between Mg-bound water
molecules, the phosphonate moiety, and the tertiary protonated NH+ group. The structure (Figure 4c)
is composed of layers of [Mg(H2O)6]2+ cations and layers of H6TDTMP2−ligand that run along the b
axis. The orientation of the tetramethylene chain on the ligand is almost parallel to the c axis. There are
no lattice water molecules in the structure. The Mg2+ center is situated in a near perfect octahedral
environment, coordinated by six water molecules (Figure 4b). The salts Mg-TDTMP and Zn-TDTMP
are isostructural [18].

The crystal structure of Ni-EDPA is composed of the [Ni(H2O)6]2+ dication, the H2EDPA2−
dianion, and one lattice water molecule, see Figure 5a. The Ni2+ center adopts an octahedral geometry,
coordinated by six water molecules, see Figure 5b. One H2EDPA2−ligand is required for charge
balance. There are numerous hydrogen bonds between the Ni-bound water molecules, the lattice
water molecule, and the phosphonate moieties. The structure (Figure 5c) can be described as being
composed of layers of [Ni(H2O)6]2+ cations and layers of the H2EDPA2−ligand that run along the b
axis. The lattice water molecule is situated in the vicinity of the Ni-OH2, and -PO3H−moieties, forming
a multitude of hydrogen bonds.

The structure of Ni-bpy-EDPA is diﬀerent from the ones of other salts described thus far,
in that the cationic portion of the salt is a cationic coordination polymer, composed of a cationic
trans-[Ni(H2O)4(4,4’-bpy)]2+ unit, propagating along the ab plane (Figure 6a,c). The Ni2+ center
was coordinated by four water molecules at equatorial positions, whereas the axial positions are
occupied by the N atom of the bridging 4,4’-bpy ligand (Figure 6b), leaving the dianionic H2EDPA2−
diphosphonate to play the role of the counterion for the cationic 1D chain. There is one lattice water
molecule (Figure 6c). The H2EDPA2−ligand moiety runs parallel to the c axis. There is a complex
network of hydrogen bonds that involve the Ni-coordinated waters, the lattice water molecules, and the
–PO3H−moieties. The structure of Ni-bpy-EDPA is reminiscent of that in the 1D nickel coordination
polymer based on P,P’-diphenylethylenediphosphinic acid and 4,4’-bipyridine [21].

3.4. Computational Results: Total Electronic Densities and Partial Charges
In order to visualise the electrostatic potential distribution around the molecular entities, the total
electron densities were coloured with the Molecular Electrostatic Potential (MEP) value using the
wxMacMolPlt software. All MEP surfaces were constructed using 80 Grid Points and a 0.1 max
iso-value for the maps. The RGB surface colouration was used and the colour maps were inverted.
The transparency was set to 50 and the surfaces were rendered as smooth and solid. After the energy
minimisation of the molecular geometries the partial charges were calculated with Mulliken and
Lowdin methods. For this study the partial charges on the phosphonic oxygen atoms are presented,
since the oxygen atoms were considered as the coordination centers of the ligands. The mean values
of the partial charges per oxygen atom were calculated for each method, and the % reduction of the
partial charge was found using Equation (1):
%[Charge Reduction] = < δqNon−EWG > −< δqEWG >
< δqNon−EWG >
× 100%
(1)
The MEP surfaces and the partial charges of all studied phosphonate molecules are presented
below in Table 2 and Figure 7.
From the results above, one can see that comparison of BPA2−with either HPABPA1−or
(HPABPA1−)2 demonstrates the partial charge reduction for both Mulliken and Lowdin methods.
The results also show that the formation of the dimer (HPABPA1−)2 from the monomer HPABPA1−
leads to even greater partial charge reduction, so the formation of the dimer results in lower electron
density around the oxygen atoms and in lower probability for coordination to the metal ion. On the
other hand, comparison of HEPA1−with H2EDPA2−demonstrates partial charge reduction for both
Mulliken and Lowdin methods. Finally, by comparing EPA2−with H2EDPA2−a greater partial charge
reduction is demonstrated by both methods and in lower probability for coordination to the metal ion.

4. Discussion
It is common in metal phosphonate chemistry to seek for MOFs, coordination polymers,
and networks that represent new and exciting structures in which the metal-phosphonate bonds play a
key role. However, there is a class of metal phosphonate compounds (salts) where the deprotonated
(anionic) phosphonate plays the role of the counterion to a cationic metal complex, or to a cationic
coordination polymer. Such non-coordinating systems are useful in modeling phosphonate compounds
in biological [53], polymeric, [54], or hydrogel matrices [6,55].
In the ionic metal phosphonates presented herein, there are two major structural features that draw
attention: (a) the cationic metal center and its coordination environment, and (b) the deprotonated
anionic phosphonate. The metal cation is bound by aqua ligands (solvent), and occasionally, by other,
externally-added ligands (4,4’-bpy in this case for Ni-bpy-EDPA). As reported before, there is a
correlation between the ionic radius of the metal ion and the bond distances between the metal and the
ligand atoms coordinated to the metal center [2,56–58]. Since there is no direct metal-phosphonate
bonding in the compounds reported herein, the only correlations that can be drawn are those for
metal-Owater bonds. By calculating the average metal-Owater bond lengths, an increasing trend can be
observed, see Figure 8.
Metal-Owater bond lengths for the divalent metal ions Zn [18], Ba [58], and Co [12] were taken
from literature sources, whereas those for Mg, Ni, Ca and Sr were taken from the structures described
in the present paper.
The phosphonate anion is invariably stabilized by hydrogen bonds. For the “simple” system
Ni-EDPA (i.e., the phosphonate ligand contains only phosphonate groups, without other ligands
present) the H2EDPA2−dianion interacts with a total of 16 hydrogen bonds (with neighboring
H2EDPA2−dianions and water molecules).
Similar observations can be made for the system
Ni-bpy-EDPA. The HPABPA−ligand possesses a doubly-deprotonated phosphonate group, but a
protonated amine group. The –PO32−moiety in the isostructural compounds Ca-PABPA and Sr-PABPA
participates in seven hydrogen bonds, whereas the –NH3+ moiety participates in three. In the structure
of Mg-PABPA, where there are also lattice waters, the –PO32−moiety participates in ﬁve hydrogen
bonds, whereas the –NH3+ moiety participates in three.
Here, the lattice and Mg-coordinated
waters form a multitude of hydrogen bonding interactions. Finally, in the Mg-TDTMP salt, the four
phosphonate groups, overall, participate in twenty one hydrogen bonds, and each protonated tertiary
Crystals 2019, 9, 301

amine group, in one. In general, it has been observed that the higher the coordination state of the
phosphonate ligand, the lower is the extent of hydrogen bonding [2].

5. Conclusions
Herein, we presented a family of metal phosphonate-based inorganic-organic salts, which share a
common characteristic, i.e., the phosphonate anion is not coordinated to a metal center, but merely plays
the role of the counter-anion. In contrast to the majority of metal phosphonate materials reported in the
literature, in which the phosphonate ligand was found coordinated to the metal center, the compounds
Mg-PABPA, Ca-PABPA, Sr-PABPA, Ni-EDPA, Mg-TDTMP, and Ni-bpy-EDPA contained the metal
center as a hydrated complex, except Ni-bpy-EDPA, which contained the Ni2+ center as part of a
coordination polymer with the 4,4’-bpy bridging ligand. The formation of these “platonic” compounds
can be explained based on the high aﬃnity of the M2+ metal ions for water as a ligand (or for 4,4’-bpy)
and the reduced aﬃnity of the phosphonate ligand, particularly in the case of H2PABPA, for the metal
centers. Another factor that plays a role in the stabilization of such compounds in the solid state is
the multitude of hydrogen bonding interactions that occur, due to the plethora of hydrogen bonding
donors and acceptors. Hence, these compounds could be attractive for applications such as proton
conductivity, and such studies are currently under way in our laboratories.
Although the main focus in metal phosphonate chemistry is the synthesis and exploration of
coordination polymers [59], the class of ionic phosphonates (either with metal complexes, or organic
counter-cations) could potentially unlock new potential in this research area. Given the plethora of
structurally diverse (poly)phosphonate [60,61] and “mixed” phosphonate (e.g. with carboxy- [56],
sulfono- [62], amino- [63], or N-heterocyclic groups [64]) ligands available, one could envision countless
possibilities in the synthesis, fabrication and properties of such solids [65].
