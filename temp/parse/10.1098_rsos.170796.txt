The Southeast Paciﬁc is characterized by rich upwelling
systems that have sustained and been impacted by human
groups for at least 12 ka. Recent ﬁshing and aquaculture
practices have put a strain on productive coastal ecosystems
from Tongoy Bay, in north-central Chile. We use a temporal
baseline to determine whether potential changes to community
structure and composition over time are due to anthropogenic
factors, natural climatic variations or both. We compiled a
database (n = 33 194) with mollusc species abundances from
the Mid-Pleistocene, Late Pleistocene, Holocene, dead shell
assemblages and live-sampled communities. Species richness
was not signiﬁcantly different, neither were diversity and
evenness indices nor rank abundance distributions. There is,
however, an increase in relative abundance for the cultured
scallop Argopecten, while the previously dominant clam Mulinia
is locally very rare. Results suggest that impacts from
both natural and anthropogenic stressors need to be better
understood if benthic resources are to be preserved. These
ﬁndings provide the ﬁrst Pleistocene temporal baseline for the
south Paciﬁc that shows that this highly productive system
has had the ability to recover from past alterations, suggesting
that if monitoring and management practices continue to be
implemented, moderately exploited communities from today
have hopes for recovery.

increased over the last centuries and decades, leading to fundamental changes in the structure and
functioning of these environments [3,4,7,8]. Classical studies incorporating historical, archaeological and
palaeontological data have shown that overﬁshing, in particular, has driven once-abundant large pelagic
predators to extinction [5] and has also dramatically altered coastal ecosystems [5,7]. Even if different
human groups have been making use of coastal resources for millennia [1,2,9–11], evidence shows that
prehistoric human populations did not exert such a strong negative pressure, in comparison to the
one marine systems have been suffering in the most recent industrial times [7,10,12,13]. In addition
to overﬁshing, coastal areas are subject to habitat modiﬁcation, deviation of watercourses, runoff of
pollutants, aquaculture, and among others [7,12,14,15]. For example, the damming of the Colorado
river caused the collapse of once very abundant populations of the clam Mulinia coloradoensis, leading
to a dramatic drop in productivity [15], changes to trophic structure [16] and a reduction in carbon
emission in the river basin [17]. Ever-growing demands for more food have led to poor aquaculture
practices that bring about changes in community structure, ecosystem function, eutrophication and
outbreaks of disease [5,18]. Yet, despite considerable efforts to summarize global trends and patterns
in exploitation and degradation of coastal areas, most of the available information is limited to the
Northern Hemisphere (but see [19] for Tasmania). Our present paradigm is thus lacking information from
other coastal environments, also under anthropogenic strain, that can provide insights for a more holistic
understanding and potentially a more holistic approach towards remediation and conservation. In this
context, coastal marine environments from the Southeast Paciﬁc, where there are highly productive
ﬁsheries related to the Humboldt Current System [13,20] are key pieces to add to the puzzle.
The Southeast Paciﬁc is characterized by important upwelling systems along the Chilean and
Peruvian coasts [20–22], that have sustained and been impacted by human groups for at least 12 ka
[11,23–27]. One of the most productive of these upwellings is located in the north-central region of Chile,
near Tongoy (30°12′ S–71°34′ W, [20,21,28], ﬁgure 1). Owing to its high productivity this bay has seen
the development of small-scale benthic ﬁsheries and of an aquaculture regime of the scallop Argopecten
purpuratus [29,30]. The uncontrolled exploitation of the scallop since 1945 led to the collapse of this ﬁshery
[25,29,30] but, given the economic importance of this resource, an aquaculture regime was implemented
in 1988 [29,30]. The area destined for scallop culture is 54% of the surface of Tongoy Bay (1900 out
of 3500 ha), and of the remaining 1500 ha, 100 ha are managed by local ﬁshermen as a ‘Management
Exploitation Area for Benthic Resources’ (AMERB) [30].
The modern benthic assemblages from Tongoy Bay have been extensively sampled and studied
from a trophic network approach [31–34]. These contributions show that the uncontrolled ﬁshing and
aquaculture regimes have not only directly impacted the exploited species, but also the structure and
functioning of the ecosystem they are a part of [31]. These trophic network studies are incredibly valuable
to understand changes to the system in the last 30 years; however, information prior to the 1980s is
lacking [31]. In order to assess the magnitude of these changes, it is necessary to use the temporal
perspective provided by a Conservation Palaeobiology approach, to compare the current community
to a pre-human-impact state [7,15,19,35–42]. Tongoy Bay has dated marine terraces from the Pleistocene
and Holocene (HOL) [43–46], making such temporal comparisons feasible.

Here, we seek to use a temporal baseline to contextualize the effect of artisanal ﬁshing and a recent
aquaculture regime to a productive coastal ecosystem from north-central Chile. We use palaeontological
data from the Pleistocene and Holocene terraces together with recent ecological sampling to quantify
community structure and composition over time, to determine whether there are changes and whether
these are due to human-related pressures, natural climatic variations or both. We hypothesize that
anthropogenic changes have altered community structure and composition over time, and that these will
be signiﬁcantly different in previous ‘states’ of the community. The results from this study will provide
one of the ﬁrst temporal baselines of this kind for the Southern Hemisphere, and in particular for a highly
productive upwelling system from the Southeast Paciﬁc.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Compilation of datasets
We compiled a database using published literature and collected fossil samples from Tongoy Bay. For
the Mid-Pleistocene, 22 samples were used (all collected); for the Late Pleistocene, 26 (all collected); for
the Holocene, 40 (all collected); for Dead Assemblages, 11 (three collected and eight from the published
literature) and for the Live samples, we used a live-collected dataset from [47] and a 2012 live-collected
dataset (partly published in [31], table 1). All the fossil samples correspond to bulk-collected unlithiﬁed
samples comparable to the unlithiﬁed Dead Assemblages and the Live samples. Quaternary terraces
of Tongoy have been dated by previous studies, showing a strong correlation between height above
sea level and age [45,46]; hence, fossil sites were assigned to different interglacial stages from their
height above sea level. Species from each time bin were pooled and labelled as follows: Mid-Pleistocene
(samples from MIS7 and MIS9 where pooled together and labelled MP), Late Pleistocene, Holocene,
Dead Assemblage (DA), Live community (LIVE). For some analyses, we pooled together MP and LP
into ‘Pleistocene’ and DA and LIVE into ‘Modern’ (see details below).
For the fossil samples, shells from each time bin were identiﬁed to species level using published
literature [48–51]. After species were identiﬁed, bivalve and gastropod individuals were counted. For
bivalves, the number of individuals was calculated diving the total number of valves by two. The live-
collected data from [47] (table 1) was collected using transects that were laid perpendicular to the bay.
Samples were collected by divers using a quadrat at depths between 7 and 25 m. For the second, 2012
study, transects were also laid perpendicular to the bay, and quadrats were used to sample benthic
organisms at 4, 8, 12 and 20 m depth. Only the data for bivalves and gastropods were used in order to
have consistency with what is preserved in the fossil samples. In addition, the pooled live-collected data
and the fossil data were checked for synonymy and updated taxonomy using the WoRMS taxon match
online tool (http://www.marinespecies.org/). After the taxonomy was homogenized, we proceeded to
separate species into categories depending if they were commercially exploited or non-exploited using
the species inventories of the Servicio Nacional de Pesca [52]. The datasets supporting this article have
been uploaded as part of the electronic supplementary material and are available on Dryad.
2.2. Diversity and abundance metrics
Species relative abundances per time bin (Pleistocene, Holocene and Modern) were calculated to
determine whether the older time bin was a good predictor of the one that followed. That is, Pleistocene
relative abundance (dependent variable) was regressed on Holocene relative abundance (independent
variable), and Holocene relative abundance was regressed on Modern relative abundance. High
agreement is indicated by species plotting along a 1 : 1 line in a bivariate plot of relative abundance
[53,54]. To test whether the slopes of those regressions were signiﬁcantly different from 1, we calculated
the upper and lower conﬁdence intervals. If a slope of 1 fell within the conﬁdence intervals, we assumed
that differences were not signiﬁcant. The residuals for the regression with the total relative abundances
were inspected to identify potential outliers. Species were considered outliers if they had a very high
abundance in the dead assemblage and were absent or had low abundances in the living assemblage. For
this analysis, we standardized Pleistocene, Holocene and Modern sample numbers by doing a rareﬁed
subsample to the smallest sample number (n = 5176, for MP and LP pooled together). The rarefaction
was done without replacement, using the ‘rrarefy’ function in the ‘vegan’ package [55], in the statistical
programming language R [56].
Diversity indices were calculated for each time bin (MP, LP, HOL, DA and LIVE). For these analyses,
we also standardized sample numbers by doing a rareﬁed subsample (without replacement) to the

smallest sample number using ‘rrarefy’. In this case, it was done to the MP sample size (n = 1668). We
calculated Shannon’s diversity index [57] and Pielou’s evenness index [58] to determine ‘dead–fossil’
compositional agreement. Indices were calculated with the ‘diversity’ function in the ‘vegan’ package
[55] in the statistical programming language R [56].
2.3. Similarity metrics for the whole assemblage, exploited and non-exploited species
To test for similarity in species composition between the different time bins (MP, LP, HOL, DA and LIVE)
Chao’s Jaccard similarity index was used [59]. Chao’s Jaccard index includes the effect of species that
are shared but unseen (either because they are rare or because the samples that are being compared
have substantial differences in size such as these live–dead assemblages). By accounting for unseen
species, this estimator is less biased than the classic Jaccard index that is only based on the presence–
absence data [59]. The Spearman rank-order correlation of species relative abundance was also used
as an indicator of similarity between the different time bins [60]. Chao’s Jaccard similarity index and
Spearman’s rank-order correlation are typically plotted on bivariate plots to represent compositional and
abundance similarity between assemblages. In this plot, sites located in the upper right-hand quadrant
have the highest agreement and sites in the lower left-hand quadrant have the lowest agreement [53].
Indices were calculated with the ‘diversity’ and ‘chao.jaccard’ functions, in the ‘vegan’ [55] and ‘fossil’
[61] packages in the statistical programming language R [56].
2.4. Rank abundance distributions
Species rank abundance plots are also good descriptors of communities [62]. Several theories and models
have been proposed to explain the different shape of rank abundance plots in communities (see [62]
for a review). Here, we ﬁt three of these models (Geometric series, Broken stick and Zipf) to the
rank abundance orders of assemblages from different time bins (Pleistocene, Holocene and Modern)
to determine the best-ﬁt model for each dataset. The best model was chosen based on at least a two-point
difference in Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). For this analysis, we also standardized Pleistocene,
Holocene and Modern sample numbers by doing a rareﬁed subsample without replacement to n = 5176.
We carried out these analyses with the ‘rrarefy’ and ‘ﬁtrad’ functions in the ‘vegan’ [55] and ‘sads’ [63]
packages in the statistical programming language R [56].
2.5. Abundance and body size of Argopecten and Mulinia through time
The relative abundance (i.e. proportion of the total individuals) of the scallop Argopecten purpuratus
(Lamarck 1819) and the clam Mulinia edulis (King & Broderip 1831) were quantiﬁed per time bin. These
two species were selected as they were very abundant in fossil samples, and are subject to ﬁshing
pressure and aquaculture (only Argopecten) nowadays.
Changes in body size can be indicative of subsistence harvesting [64] and ﬁshing pressure [65]. Species
typically exhibit decreasing body size, indicative of an overexploitation of larger size classes [64,65]. The
two most abundant species in Tongoy Bay are subject to different anthropogenic pressures as Argopecten
is cultivated, but Mulinia is not. Thus, it is possible there are variations in size between the fossil and
the dead samples for these species. To explore this, specimens from Argopecten (n = 135) and Mulinia
(n = 3803) were measured to the nearest millimetre using a digital caliper, and their body size was
calculated per time bin as the geometric mean of shell height and shell length [66].

3. Results
3.1. Diversity and abundance metrics
The samples collected and compiled from the literature (n = 690, table 1) yielded a live assemblage with
18 161 individuals from 36 species, DAs with 1934 shells from 24 species, and fossil assemblages with
3242 individuals and 20 species from the HOL, 8189 and 24 from the LP, and 1668 and 19 from the MP
(table 1). The combined richness was of 62 species.
Univariate raw unstandardized diversity metrics are not different between time periods (table 1).
Species richness is not signiﬁcantly different (Kruskal–Wallis rank sum test, χ2 = 4, p = 0.406), neither are
Shannon’s or Pielou’s diversity and evenness indices (Kruskal–Wallis rank sum test, χ2 = 4, p = 0.406
for both). When Pleistocene and Holocene samples are pooled together, linear models indicate that
abundances of Pleistocene species are signiﬁcant predictors of the Holocene species relative abundance
(adjusted R2 = 0.20, F = 5.83, p = 0.03, electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S1a); however, pooled
Holocene species are not signiﬁcant predictors of Modern species relative abundances (adjusted
R2 = −0.05, F = 0.009, p = 0.92; electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S1b), suggesting a shift in
species composition and/or relative abundances in the live-collected samples. Conﬁdence intervals
indicate that slopes are slightly lower than 1 for the Pleistocene and Holocene (lower CI = 0.07, upper
CI = 0.96), but the Holocene and Modern slope is signiﬁcantly lower than 1 (lower CI = −0.48, upper
CI = 0.53).
3.2. Similarity metrics for the whole assemblage, exploited and non-exploited species
Chao’s Jaccard index for assemblage-level compositional similarity between time periods is higher than
0.64 for all comparisons (electronic supplementary material, table S1; ﬁgure 2a). This similarity between
samples suggests stability in composition throughout the span of the Quaternary analysed. A visual
inspection of the bivariate plot with Chao’s Jaccard similarity index and Spearman’s ρ (ﬁgure 2a) shows
that the samples fall in the upper right-hand quadrant, indicating that live–dead agreement is high [53].
Signiﬁcance for Spearman’s rank correlations between samples is shown in the electronic supplementary
material, table S1.
When species were subdivided into ‘Exploited’ and ‘Non-exploited’ categories it became evident that
‘Exploited’ species were driving the dissimilarity between live-collected and fossil samples (electronic
supplementary material, table S1; ﬁgure 2b,c). The species classiﬁed as ‘Exploited’ (or ‘exploitable’ in the
case of the fossil samples that are prior to documented human exploitation) make up a large proportion
of the community. Moreover, ‘Non-exploited’ species tend to be less abundant, sometimes rare. Thus, it is
not surprising that the data show a less clear pattern for the latter (ﬁgure 2b,c). Spearman’s ρ is signiﬁcant
for only half of the comparisons in ‘Exploited’ and ‘Non-exploited’ (electronic supplementary material,
table S1). A visual inspection of ﬁgure 2b,c shows that comparisons between fossils and the live-collected
samples plot in the upper right-hand quadrant for ‘Exploited’, but differ for just ‘Non-exploited’.
3.3. Rank abundance distributions
Species rank abundance distributions for Modern, Holocene and Pleistocene assemblages are best
explained by the same model, as indicated by AIC (electronic supplementary material, table S2;
ﬁgure 3a–c). The model with the strongest support is Zipf.
3.4. Abundance of Argopecten and Mulinia through time
The relative abundance of ‘Exploited’ and ‘Non-exploited’ species was calculated for each time bin
(ﬁgure 4a,b). For the LIVE assemblage 21% of the individuals belong to exploited species and 50%
of that corresponds to the scallop Argopecten. If these values are compared to those from the older
fossil assemblages, the individuals that belong to exploited species make up between 40% (MP) and
92% (HOL) but Argopecten was responsible for less than a ﬁfth of this, and the clam Mulinia for
over 50% (ﬁgure 4b). Thus, locally harvested Argopecten shows an increase in relative abundance in
LIVE compared with fossil assemblages, whereas Mulinia used to be very abundant in the recent
past (over 80% of the ‘exploitable’ species) but has decreased in abundance and is rare in the LIVE
assemblage (ﬁgure 4b).

3.5. Body size of Argopecten and Mulinia through time
The clam Mulinia shows a signiﬁcant decrease in body size from the HOL to the DA as well as between
MP and all the other time bins (electronic supplementary material, table S3; ﬁgure 4d). Unfortunately,
there is no comparable size data for live-collected Mulinia, but using data from Stotz et al. [67] we
determined that for Mulinia from a neighbouring bay, the mean length is 37 mm while the mean length
for the HOL and DAs from the samples used here are 53 and 52 mm, respectively (see the electronic
supplementary material datasets). Thus, there has been a decrease in mean length of 15–16 mm. The
body size of the scallop Argopecten, in contrast, shows less variability through time (ﬁgure 4c), with only
MP shells showing signiﬁcant differences in size with HOL shells (electronic supplementary material,
table S3).
4. Discussion
Assemblage-level metrics of diversity and compositional similarity over time suggest that the benthic
community at Tongoy Bay has remained relatively stable through the Quaternary. Moreover, despite

ﬁshing and aquaculture pressure, in the last two decades the benthic community shows signs of resilience
and recovery [31]. When results are considered for two of the most abundant species, however, this
general positive outlook becomes questionable. There is an artiﬁcial increase in the relative abundance
of Argopecten, while Mulinia is nowadays very rare, and only consistently found alive in neighbouring
bays. The increase in Argopecten abundance is probably a reﬂection of aquaculture practices, yet we
are unaware of any detrimental effects this practice could have had on Mulinia. The absence of this
clam may be due to natural environmental changes in the region, local changes in freshwater input
to the bay (see ‘Reconstructing the regional history of Mulinia’ in the Discussion), and/or to more
recent anthropogenic impacts such as disease by parasites (see ‘Recent local anthropogenic pressures
on the benthic community’ in the Discussion). Results indicate that natural and anthropogenic stressors
probably impacted the populations at different times, with strong anthropogenic impacts being quite
recent (less than 50 years). Findings from this study suggest that benthic communities from the south
Paciﬁc show strong resilience and recovery potential, but drivers of change and their impacts on
key species need to be better understood if benthic resources are to be preserved in the near future.
Moreover, even if it exceeds the scope of the manuscript, it is worth emphasizing that in order to
reconstruct changes in the community over time a Conservation Palaeobiology approach is fundamental.
This would require doing more detailed palaeoenvironmental reconstructions together with a reﬁned
stratigraphic framework.

4.1. Stability and recovery despite human pressure
The stability or resilience suggested by the mollusc data from Tongoy Bay is in agreement with global
studies that also indicate high recovery potential in marine ecosystems [7,68]. For example, fossil
marine faunas have shown stasis through time [69–71] while modern marine faunas seem to have
high recovery potential, returning to conditions similar to the original one in decades [7,72,73]. More
speciﬁcally for molluscs, it has been shown that the composition of bivalves and gastropods from
reefs in the Bahamas had remained stable from the Pleistocene [74]. Other studies have nevertheless
found remarkable differences between marine communities from the Pleistocene and Holocene with
present-day assemblages [39,70]. For example, fossil molluscs from core samples collected in the Adriatic
Sea had different composition, diversity and dominance than their recent counterparts, suggesting
these communities remained relatively unchanged throughout glacial–interglacial cycles but shifted in
composition in recent times probably due to anthropogenic impacts [39]. Similarly, coral communities
from Barbados showed resilience and stability through the Pleistocene but dramatic shifts in composition
and abundance were observed in recent coral species relative to fossil ones [70]. Results from these
temporal studies can, however, be contingent on the scale of analyses [75]. Similar research on molluscs
found that species composition was highly similar between Pleistocene and Modern samples when
viewed at a regional scale, but similarity decreased when comparisons were done at a local scale [75].
In addition, preliminary results suggest strong differences in species composition between Modern and
Pleistocene assemblages in other localities in north-central Chile [42].
4.2. Reconstructing the regional history of Mulinia
Despite the stability in composition and abundance in the mollusc community, and the lack of signiﬁcant
differences between the measured indices, Mulinia is locally very rare in Tongoy Bay and is only
consistently found alive in neighbouring bays [67]. This marked change in the dominance of the
clam can be a consequence of natural and anthropogenic causes. Results at hand, together with

regional information, previous studies on congeneric species, and ﬁsheries landings suggest that the
disappearance of the clam was mainly due to natural factors. At a regional level, Mulinia was the most
common bivalve in Pleistocene assemblages from northern Chile and Peru [44]. There are, however,
notable differences in abundance and size for Mulinia between the MP and LP. This could be associated
with the much higher uplift rates estimated for Tongoy Bay during the MP (in particular MIS 7 and MIS
9) compared with the LP [45]. These high uplift rates induced by tectonic processes could have led to a
higher probability of coastal modiﬁcation and habitat destruction, which could have impacted molluscan
abundance and size. The species seems to have recovered in the LP. During the Holocene, however, the
record of the Mulinia is very sparse, as the clam practically disappeared from northern Chile and is only
found in one Holocene terrace in Peru (Michilla terrace around 7 ka [44]). Thus, it has been suggested that
the dramatic shrinking of the species distribution occurred in the Holocene, possibly by a combination of
palaeoceanographic circumstances together with biological phenomena [44]. More recent palaeoclimatic
studies in northern Chile and Peru support this idea, given that aridity increased in the region during the
Mid-Holocene [76–79]. Speciﬁc dates vary but most studies indicate that a displacement of the southern
Westerlies (which control an N-S precipitation gradient) caused arid conditions between 7.7 and 4.2 ka
[76–79]. This aridity could have indirectly affected Mulinia due to a decrease in freshwater input.
Previous studies show that populations of the congeneric Mulinia coloradoensis from the Northern
Hemisphere were decimated by a decrease in freshwater and nutrient input [15]. These changes
caused by the damming of the Colorado river signiﬁcantly decreased the productivity of the associated
estuary and brought about detrimental ecosystem-level consequences [15–17,80]. Therefore, it is likely
that Mulinia from Chile and Peru could have also thrived in estuary conditions during more humid
weather. This idea is further supported by the presence of the species in estuaries in Los Lagos region,
southern Chile.
Another local line of evidence suggesting that a freshwater input is important for the species comes
from recent ﬁsheries landings in the area (electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S2). According to this
information, the species was initially not exploited (ﬁrst records are from 1994) due to low abundance
but there was a boost in the population during 1997, a strong ENSO year [20], and a sharp decline in
landings afterwards. The increase in rain that year brought water to previously dry riverbanks that
discharge in Tongoy Bay, perhaps creating favourable conditions for the clam and leading to an increased
catchment by the local ﬁshermen towards the end of the year. Regardless of this isolated local event, if we
consider together the evidence from regional climate changes and life-history information of congeneric
species, we can suggest that the disappearance of the clam Mulinia was probably a regional phenomenon
driven by natural changes in environmental conditions, rather than a consequence of negative
human impacts.
4.3. Recent local anthropogenic pressures on the benthic community
Despite the strong evidence pointing to natural regional changes, human-induced aquaculture and
ﬁshing pressures might also be having a more recent detrimental effect. Studies looking at the status
of the system in Tongoy Bay from a trophic network approach found that the overall health of the
community improved from 1994 to 2012 [31]. This apparent recovery was brought about by release
from ﬁshing pressure due to the establishment of better management practices in the 1990s. Mulinia
is, however, still not present in the living community, and the banks of the species in neighbouring
bays are 97% infected with a trematode parasite that attacks soft tissue, the gills in particular [67]. No
information is yet available on the parasite species or where it came from but its presence might be related
to aquaculture practices in the bay [81]. For example, the scallop Argopecten has numerous described
parasites and commensals [82] that could also use Mulinia as a host. Therefore, even if the major changes
to species populations and abundance over time appear to have been natural, there are anthropogenic
factors that presently pose a threat, might have not left a record yet and should thus continue to be
closely monitored.
4.4. Caveats and closing remarks
So far, results indicate that the benthic environment is Tongoy Bay has been stable through the
Quaternary and if changes occurred, the system showed resilience. Nevertheless, a caveat to consider
is that this study was centred on the benthic mollusc community, limiting our understanding of large
and/or pelagic organisms, for example. Previous research [3,5,83] has shown that large pelagic predators
were decimated in tropical seas worldwide, leading to changes in functionality in the whole community.

We are unaware if something like this happened to large pelagic ﬁsh in Tongoy Bay but the evidence at
hand shows that mollusc communities are good surrogates for the benthic community [84], suggesting
that our ﬁndings are at least a reliable representation of changes to this part of the community over time.
Here, we present what is to our knowledge the ﬁrst Conservation Palaeobiology study for South
America and for a highly productive upwelling system in the south Paciﬁc Ocean. Our results suggest
that the marine benthic community shows resilience and recovery from the Mid-Pleistocene onwards.
An important decrease in relative abundance to the once dominant clam Mulinia seems to respond
to natural climatic shifts in the Holocene. There are, however, indications that recent anthropogenic
pressures may lead to unseen changes in the region as the clam is infested by parasites in neighbouring
bays, and the scallop Argopecten has an artiﬁcially increased relative abundance probably due to
aquaculture. These ﬁndings provide a temporal baseline that shows that this highly productive system
has had the ability to recover from past alterations. Nonetheless, trophic network studies in Tongoy
Bay [31] and in central Chile [85] suggest that ﬁsheries can heavily modulate subtidal communities,
with impacts extending even to non-harvested species [85]. Therefore, whether more recent human
pressures will modify this long-time history of resilience remains to be seen. This temporal perspective
provides an understanding of the variability displayed by this benthic marine system in the past, which
is critical in order to manage for the future [36,37,86,87]. Studies of this kind are much needed to
better comprehend recent changes to global marine communities where the literature is dominated by
examples from the Northern Hemisphere and tropical environments. Assuming the system continues to
behave as in the past, ﬁndings presented here suggest that if monitoring and management practices
continue to be implemented, the moderately exploited communities from today have high hopes
for recovery.
