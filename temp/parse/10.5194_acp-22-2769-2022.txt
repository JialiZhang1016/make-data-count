Abstract. Aerosol–cloud–precipitation interactions (ACIs) provide the greatest source of uncertainties in pre-
dicting changes in Earth’s energy budget due to poor representation of marine stratocumulus and the associated
ACIs in climate models. Using in situ data from 329 cloud proﬁles across 24 research ﬂights from the NASA Ob-
seRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS (ORACLES) ﬁeld campaign in September 2016,
August 2017, and October 2018, it is shown that contact between above-cloud biomass burning aerosols and
marine stratocumulus over the Southeast Atlantic Ocean was associated with precipitation suppression and a de-
crease in the precipitation susceptibility (So) to aerosols. The 173 “contact” proﬁles with aerosol concentration
(Na) greater than 500 cm−3 within 100 m above cloud tops had a 50 % lower precipitation rate (Rp) and a 20 %
lower So, on average, compared to 156 “separated” proﬁles with Na less than 500 cm−3 up to at least 100 m
above cloud tops.
Contact and separated proﬁles had statistically signiﬁcant differences in droplet concentration (Nc) and ef-
fective radius (Re) (95 % conﬁdence intervals from a two-sample t test are reported). Contact proﬁles had 84
to 90 cm−3 higher Nc and 1.4 to 1.6 µm lower Re compared to separated proﬁles. In clean boundary layers
(below-cloud Na less than 350 cm−3), contact proﬁles had 25 to 31 cm−3 higher Nc and 0.2 to 0.5 µm lower Re.
In polluted boundary layers (below-cloud Na exceeding 350 cm−3), contact proﬁles had 98 to 108 cm−3 higher
Nc and 1.6 to 1.8 µm lower Re. On the other hand, contact and separated proﬁles had statistically insigniﬁcant
differences between the average liquid water path, cloud thickness, and meteorological parameters like surface
temperature, lower tropospheric stability, and estimated inversion strength. These results suggest the changes
in cloud microphysical properties were driven by ACIs rather than meteorological effects, and adjustments to
existing relationships between Rp and Nc in model parameterizations should be considered to account for the
role of ACIs.

Introduction
Clouds drive the global hydrological cycle with an an-
nual average precipitation rate of 3 mm d−1 over the oceans
(Behrangi et al., 2014). Marine stratocumulus cloud (MSC)
is the most common cloud type with an annual coverage of
22 % over the ocean surface (Eastman et al., 2011). These
low-level, boundary layer clouds typically exist over subtrop-
ical oceans in regions with large-scale subsidence such as
the Southeast Atlantic Ocean (Klein and Hartmann, 1993).
MSCs have higher reﬂectivity (albedo) than the ocean sur-
face, which results in a strong, negative shortwave cloud ra-
diative forcing (CRF) with a weak and positive longwave
CRF (Oreopoulos and Rossow, 2011).
Low-cloud cover in the subsidence regions is negatively
correlated with sea surface temperature (SST) (Eastman et
al., 2011; Wood and Hartmann, 2006). CRF is thus sensitive
to changes in SST, but there is a large spread in model es-
timates of CRF sensitivity (Bony and Dufresne, 2005). This
provides uncertainty in the model estimates of Earth’s en-
ergy budget in future climate scenarios (Trenberth and Fa-
sullo, 2009). Uncertainty in the parameterization of bound-
ary layer aerosol, cloud, and precipitation processes con-
tributes to model uncertainties (Ahlgrimm and Forbes, 2014;
Stephens et al., 2010).
MSC CRF is regulated by cloud processes that depend
on cloud microphysical properties, like droplet concentration
(Nc), effective radius (Re), and liquid water content (LWC),
and macrophysical properties, like cloud thickness (H) and
liquid water path (LWP). These cloud properties can de-
pend on the concentration, composition, and size distribu-
tions of aerosols, which act as cloud condensation nuclei.
Under conditions of constant LWC, increases in aerosol con-
centration (Na) can increase Nc and decrease Re, strengthen-
ing the shortwave CRF (Twomey, 1974, 1977). A decrease
in droplet sizes in polluted clouds can inhibit droplet growth
from collision–coalescence and suppress precipitation inten-
sity, resulting in lower precipitation rate (Rp), higher LWP,
and increased cloud lifetime (Albrecht, 1989). In combina-
tion, these aerosol–cloud–precipitation interactions (ACIs)
and the resulting cloud adjustments lead to an effective ra-
diative forcing, termed ERFaci (Boucher et al., 2013).
Satellite retrievals of Re and cloud optical thickness (τ)
can be used to estimate Nc and LWP using the adiabatic as-
sumption (Boers et al., 2006; Wood and Hartmann, 2006;
Bennartz, 2007). LWC increases linearly with height in adi-
abatic clouds, and τ is parameterized as a function of Nc
and LWP (ταN1/3
c
LWP5/6) (Brenguier et al., 2000). Since
τ has greater sensitivity to LWP compared to Nc, assum-
ing constant LWP under different aerosol conditions can
lead to underestimation of the cloud albedo susceptibility
to aerosol perturbations (Platnick and Twomey, 1994; Mc-
Comiskey and Feingold, 2012).
LWP can have a positive or negative response to increas-
ing Nc due to aerosols (Toll et al., 2019). The LWP response
is regulated by environmental conditions (e.g., lower tro-
pospheric stability (LTS), boundary layer depth (HBL), and
relative humidity), cloud particle sizes (e.g., represented by
Re), Rp, and by Nc and LWP themselves (Chen et al., 2014;
Gryspeerdt et al., 2019; Toll et al., 2019; Possner et al.,
2020). Accurate estimation of the LWP response to aerosol
perturbations is important for regional and global estimates
of ERFaci (Douglas and L’Ecuyer, 2019, 2020).
Droplet evaporation associated with cloud-top entrainment
and precipitation constitutes the two major sinks of LWC in
MSC. Smaller droplets associated with higher Nc or Na evap-
orate more readily, which leads to greater cloud-top evapora-
tive cooling and a negative LWP response (Hill et al., 2008).
The LWP response to the evaporation–entrainment feedback
(Xue and Feingold, 2006; Small et al., 2009) also depends on
above-cloud humidity (Ackerman et al., 2004). Precipitation
susceptibility (So) to aerosol-induced changes in cloud prop-
erties is related to the change in Rp due to aerosol-induced
changes in Nc and is a function of LWP or H (Feingold and
Seibert, 2009).
The magnitude of So depends on precipitation formation
processes like collision–coalescence which are parameter-
ized in models using mass transfer rates, such as the auto-
conversion rate (SAUTO) and the accretion rate (SACC) (Mor-
rison and Gettelman, 2008; Geoffroy et al., 2010). Autocon-
version describes the process of collisions between cloud
droplets that coalesce to form drizzle drops which initiate
precipitation. Accretion refers to collisions between cloud
droplets and drizzle drops which lead to larger drizzle drops
and greater precipitation intensity. The variability in So as a
function of LWP or H depends on the cloud type and the
ratio of SACC versus SAUTO (Wood et al., 2009; Jiang et al.,
2010; Sorooshian et al., 2010).
Recent ﬁeld campaigns focused on studying ACIs over
the Southeast Atlantic Ocean because unique meteorolog-
ical conditions are present in the region (Zuidema et al.,
2016; Redemann et al., 2021). Biomass burning aerosols
from southern Africa are lofted into the free troposphere (Gui
et al., 2021) and transported over the Southeast Atlantic by
mid-tropospheric winds where the aerosols overlay an exten-
sive MSC deck that exists off the coast of Namibia and An-
gola (Adebiyi and Zuidema, 2016; Devasthale and Thomas,
2011). The above-cloud aerosol plume is associated with ele-
vated water vapor content (Pistone et al., 2021), which inﬂu-
ences cloud-top humidity and dynamics following the mech-
anisms discussed by Ackerman et al. (2004). In situ obser-
vations of cloud and aerosol properties were collected over
the Southeast Atlantic during the NASA ObseRvations of
Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS (ORACLES)
ﬁeld campaign during three Intensive Observation Periods
(IOPs) in September 2016, August 2017, and October 2018
(Redemann et al., 2021).
During ORACLES, the aerosol layer was comprised
of shortwave-absorbing aerosols (500 nm single-scattering
albedo of about 0.83), with above-cloud aerosol optical depth

up to 0.42 (Pistone et al., 2019; LeBlanc et al., 2020). The
sign of the forcing due to shortwave absorption by the aerosol
layer depends on the location of aerosols in the vertical col-
umn and the albedo of the underlying clouds (Cochrane et al.,
2019). Warming aloft due to aerosol absorption of solar radi-
ation strengthens the temperature inversion, which decreases
dry air entrainment into clouds, increases LWP and cloud
albedo, and decreases the shortwave CRF (Wilcox, 2010).
The net radiative forcing due to the aerosol and cloud lay-
ers thus depends on aerosol-induced changes in Nc, Re, and
LWP and the resulting changes in τ. Sinks of Nc and LWP
like precipitation and entrainment mixing lead to uncertain-
ties in satellite retrievals of Nc, which pose the biggest chal-
lenge in the use of satellite retrievals to study the aerosol im-
pact on Nc (Quaas et al., 2020). This motivates observational
studies of ACIs that examine Nc and LWP under different
aerosol and meteorological conditions.
During the 2016 IOP, variable vertical displacement (0 to
2000 m) was observed between above-cloud aerosols and the
MSC (Gupta et al., 2021; hereafter G21). Instances of con-
tact and separation between the aerosol and cloud layers were
associated with differences in the above- and below-cloud
Na, water vapor mixing ratio (wv), and cloud-top entrain-
ment processes. These differences led to changes in Nc, Re,
and LWC and their vertical proﬁles (G21). In this study, the
response of the MSC to above- and below-cloud aerosols is
further examined using data from all three ORACLES IOPs,
and precipitation formation and So are evaluated as a func-
tion of H.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, the ORA-
CLES observations are discussed, along with the data qual-
ity assurance procedures (additional details are in the Sup-
plement). In Sect. 3, the calculation of cloud properties is de-
scribed. In Sect. 4, the inﬂuence of aerosols on Nc, Re, and
LWC is examined by comparing the parameters for MSC in
contact or separated from the above-cloud aerosol layer. In
Sect. 5, the changes in precipitation formation due to aerosol-
induced microphysical changes are examined. In Sect. 6, Nc,
Rp, and So are examined as a function of H and the above-
and below-cloud Na. In Sect. 7, the meteorological condi-
tions are examined using reanalysis data. In Sect. 8, the con-
clusions are summarized with directions for future work.

Observations
The ORACLES IOPs were based at Walvis Bay, Namibia
(23◦S, 14.6◦E), in September 2016, and at São Tomé and
Príncipe (0.3◦N, 6.7◦E) in August 2017 and October 2018.
The data analyzed in this study were collected during the
three IOPs (Table 1 and Fig. 1): six P-3 research ﬂights
(PRFs) from 6 to 25 September 2016 with cloud sampling
conducted between 1◦W to 12◦E and 9 to 20◦S; seven PRFs
from 12 to 28 August 2017 with cloud sampling conducted
between 8◦W to 6◦E and 2 to 15◦S; and 11 PRFs from
Figure 1. PRF tracks from ORACLES IOPs with base of operations
and cloud sampling locations (tracks for multiple 2017 and 2018
PRFs overlap along 5◦E).
27 September to 23 October 2018 with cloud sampling con-
ducted between 3◦W to 9◦E and 1◦N to 15◦S. These PRFs
were selected because in situ cloud sampling was conducted
during at least three vertical proﬁles through the cloud layer
(Table 1).
Three PRFs from the 2016 IOP had overlapping tracks
when the P-3B aircraft ﬂew northwest from 23◦S, 13.5◦E
toward 10◦S, 0◦E and returned along the same track (Fig. 1).
The 2017 and 2018 IOPs had 10 PRFs with overlapping ﬂight
tracks when the aircraft ﬂew south from 0◦N, 5◦E toward
15◦S, 5◦E and returned along the same track. PRFs with
overlapping tracks acquired statistics for model evaluation
(Doherty et al., 2022), while the other PRFs targeted speciﬁc
locations based on meteorological conditions (Redemann et
al., 2021).
During ORACLES, the NASA P-3B aircraft was equipped
with in situ probes. The data analyzed in this study were
collected using Cloud Droplet Probes (CDPs) (Lance et al.,
2010), a cloud and aerosol spectrometer (CAS) on the cloud,
aerosol and precipitation spectrometer (Baumgardner et al.,
2001), a phase Doppler interferometer (PDI) (Chuang et al.,
2008), a two-dimensional stereo probe (2D-S) (Lawson et al.,
2006), a high-volume precipitation sampler (HVPS-3) (Law-
son et al., 1998), a King hot wire (King et al., 1978), and a
Passive Cavity Aerosol Spectrometer Probe (PCASP) (Cai et
al., 2013). A single CDP was used during the 2016 IOP (here-
after CDP-A), a second CDP (hereafter CDP-B) was added
for the 2017 and 2018 IOPs, and CDP-A was replaced by a
different CDP (hereafter CDP-C) for the 2018 IOP.
The CAS, CDP, King hot wire, and PCASP data were pro-
cessed at the University of North Dakota using the Airborne
Data Processing and Analysis processing package (Delene,
2011). The PDI data were processed at the University of
Hawaii. The 2D-S and HVPS-3 data were processed using
the University of Illinois/Oklahoma Optical Array Probe Pro-

cessing procedures followed to reject artifacts were summa-
rized by G21. Comparisons between the cloud probe datasets
are described in the Supplement.
The King hot wire was used to sample LWC (here-
after King LWC). The PCASP was used to sample the
accumulation-mode aerosols sized from 0.1 to 3.0 µm. The
CAS, CDP, PDI, 2D-S, and HVPS-3 collectively sampled
the number distribution function N(D) for particles with
diameter D from 0.5 to 19200 µm. The size distribution
covering the complete droplet size range was determined
by merging the N(D) for 3<D<50 µm with the N(D)
for 50<D<1050 µm from the 2D-S and the N(D) for
1050<D<19200 µm from the HVPS-3. The HVPS-3 sam-
pled droplets with D>1050 µm for a single 1 Hz data sam-
ple across the PRFs analyzed in this study. Measurement
uncertainties in droplet sizes were expected to be within
20 % for droplets with D>5 µm from the CAS and the CDP,
D>50 µm from the 2D-S, and D>750 µm from the HVPS-3
(Baumgardner et al., 2017).
During each PRF, at least two independent measurements
of N(D) were made for 3<D<50 µm using the CAS, the
PDI, or a CDP (Table 1). The differences between the Nc
and LWC derived from the CAS, PDI, and CDP N(D)
were quantiﬁed to determine if these differences were within
measurement uncertainties. The LWC estimates from the
CAS, PDI, and CDP were compared with the adiabatic
LWC (LWCad), which represents the theoretical maximum
for LWC (Brenguier et al., 2000). The N(D) for droplets
with D<50 µm was determined using the probe which con-
sistently had the LWC with better agreement with the LWCad
during each IOP (see Supplement). LWCad can be used to
compare LWC from different probes since it is derived using
environmental conditions and does not depend on the cloud
probe datasets. The relative differences between the LWCad
and the LWC estimates from cloud probes provide a measure
of the uncertainty associated with using one probe over the
other for data analysis.
The differences between in-cloud datasets from different
instruments were determined using a two-sample t test. The
95 % conﬁdence intervals (CIs) between parameter means

were reported if the differences were statistically signiﬁ-
cant. During the 2017 IOP, the CAS and the CDP-B sampled
droplets with D<50 µm. The CDP-B LWC was higher than
the CAS LWC (95 % CIs: 0.11 to 0.12 g m−3 higher), and
the average CDP-B LWC (0.18 g m−3) had better agreement
with the average LWCad (0.24 g m−3) compared to the av-
erage CAS LWC (0.08 g m−3). Thus, the CDP-B N(D) was
used to represent the N(D) for droplets with D<50 µm for
the 2017 IOP.
Similar results were obtained when the CAS LWC and the
CDP-B LWC were compared with the LWCad for the 2018
IOP. During the 2018 IOP, the CDP-C was mounted at a dif-
ferent location relative to the aircraft wing compared to the
CAS and CDP-B, and the positions of CDP-B and CDP-C
were switched after 10 October 2018. O’Brien et al. (2022)
found the CDP mounting positions had only a 6 % impact
on the calculation of Nc, and the average CDP-B LWC and
CDP-C LWC were within 0.02 g m−3. To maintain consis-
tency with the 2017 IOP, data from the CDP mounted next
to the CAS were used for droplets with D<50 µm for the
2018 IOP (except on 15 October 2018 when the CDP-C had
a voltage issue).
During the 2016 IOP, measurements from the CDP-A were
unusable for all PRFs due to an optical misalignment issue.
Nevertheless, the CAS and the PDI sampled droplets with
3<D<50 µm. On average, the PDI LWC was higher than the
CAS LWC (95 % CIs: 0.20 to 0.21 g m−3 higher). Since the
PDI LWC was greater than the LWCad (95 % CIs: 0.04 to
0.06 g m−3 higher), it was hypothesized that the PDI LWC
was an overestimate of the actual LWC. Thus, the CAS N(D)
was used to represent the N(D) for droplets with D<50 µm
for the 2016 IOP.
The 2D-S has two channels which concurrently sample
the cloud volume. Nc and LWC were derived using data
from the horizontal channel (NH and LWCH) and the ver-
tical channel (NV and LWCV). NH and LWCH were used
for the 2016 IOP because NV and LWCV were not available
due to soot deposition on the inside of the receive-side mir-
ror of the vertical channel. NH and NV as well as LWCH
and LWCV were strongly correlated for the 2017 and 2018
IOPs, with Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient R ≥0.92 and the
best-ﬁt slope ≥0.90. The high correlation values suggest that
little difference would have resulted from using the average
of the two 2D-S channels. To maintain consistency with the
2016 IOP, NH and LWCH were used for all three IOPs.

Cloud properties
The N(D) from the merged droplet size distribution was
integrated to calculate Nc. The 1 Hz data samples with
Nc>10 cm−3 and King LWC >0.05 g m−3 were deﬁned as
in-cloud measurements (G21). The PCASP N(D) was used
to determine the out-of-cloud Na. In situ cloud sampling dur-
ing ORACLES included ﬂight legs when the P-3B aircraft as-
cended or descended through the cloud layer (hereafter cloud
proﬁles). Data from 329 cloud proﬁles with just under 4 h of
cloud sampling were examined (Table 1).
For every cloud proﬁle, the cloud top height (ZT) was
deﬁned as the highest altitude with Nc>10 cm−3 and King
LWC >0.05 g m−3 (Table 2). The average ZT during OR-
ACLES was 1038 ± 270 m, where the uncertainty estimate
refers to the standard deviation. The cloud base height (ZB)
was deﬁned as the lowest altitude with Nc>10 cm−3 and
King LWC >0.05 g m−3. In decoupled boundary layers, a
layer of cumulus can be present below the stratocumulus
layer with a gap between the cloud layers (Wood, 2012).
Measurements from stratocumulus were used in this study,
and ZB for the stratocumulus layer was identiﬁed as the al-
titude above which the King LWC increased without gaps
greater than 25 m in the cloud sampling up to ZT.
The difference between ZT and ZB was deﬁned as H.
Due to aerosol-induced changes in entrainment and bound-
ary layer stability, the aerosol impact on H and ZT can have
the strongest inﬂuence on LWP adjustments associated with
ACIs (Toll et al., 2019). Thus, the inﬂuence of ACIs on pre-
cipitation formation and So was examined as a function of
H. Data collected during incomplete proﬁles of the stratocu-
mulus or while sampling open-cell clouds (for example, on
2 October 2018) were excluded because of difﬁculties with
estimating H for such proﬁles.
For each 1 Hz in-cloud data sample, the droplet size dis-
tribution was used to calculate Re following Hansen and
Travis (1974), where

to discrete sums for D>3 µm to consider the contributions of
cloud drops and not aerosols.
According to the adiabatic model (Brenguier et al., 2000),
LWCad and LWPad are functions of H (the subscript “ad”
added to represent the adiabatic equivalents). These relation-

Aerosol inﬂuence on cloud microphysics
The MSCs over the Southeast Atlantic were overlaid by
biomass burning aerosols from southern Africa (Adebiyi and
Zuidema, 2016; Redemann et al., 2021), with instances of
contact and separation between the MSC cloud tops and the
base of the biomass burning aerosol layer (G21). Across the
three IOPs, 173 proﬁles were conducted at locations where
an extensive aerosol plume with Na>500 cm−3 was located
within 100 m above ZT (hereafter contact proﬁles) (Table 1).
156 proﬁles were conducted at locations where the level of
Na>500 cm−3 was located at least 100 m above ZT (here-
after separated proﬁles). About 50 % of the in situ cloud
sampling across the three IOPs was conducted during con-
tact proﬁles (Table 1). Due to inter-annual variability, contact
proﬁles accounted for about 42 %, 91 %, and 39 % of the in
situ cloud sampling during the 2016, 2017, and 2018 IOPs,
respectively.
The average Nc and Re for all cloud proﬁles across the
three IOPs were 157±96 cm−3 and 8.2±2.7 µm, respectively
(Table 3). The high proportion of contact proﬁles during the
2017 IOP was associated with higher average Nc and lower
average Re (229 cm−3 and 6.9 µm) compared to the 2016
IOP (150 cm−3 and 7.0 µm) and the 2018 IOP (132 cm−3 and
9.8 µm). It is possible that the use of CDP-B data for the 2017
IOP contributed to the increase in average Nc relative to the
2016 IOP. However, the difference between the average CAS
Nc and the average CDP-B Nc for the 2017 IOP (12 cm−3)
was lower than the difference between the average Nc for the
2016 and 2017 IOPs (79 cm−3). The difference between the
Nc for these IOPs was thus primarily due to the conditions
at the cloud sampling locations. The microphysical differ-
ences between the 2016 and 2017 IOPs were associated with
differences in surface precipitation. Based on the W-band re-
trievals from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Airborne Precip-
itation Radar Version 3 (APR-3), the 2017 IOP had fewer
proﬁles with precipitation reaching the surface (13 %) com-
pared to the 2016 IOP (34 %) (Dzambo et al., 2019).
On average, contact proﬁles had signiﬁcantly higher Nc
(95 % CIs: 84 to 90 cm−3 higher) and lower Re (95 % CIs:
1.4 to 1.6 µm lower) compared to separated proﬁles (through-
out the study, the term “signiﬁcant” is exclusively used to
represent statistical signiﬁcance). The signiﬁcant differences

in Nc and Re were associated with signiﬁcantly higher τ
(95 % CIs: 0.04 to 3.06 higher) for contact proﬁles, in accor-
dance with the Twomey effect (Twomey, 1974, 1977). These
results were consistent with the 2016 IOP when the contact
proﬁles had higher Nc (95 % CIs: 60 to 68 cm−3 higher),
lower Re (95 % CIs: 1.1 to 1.3 µm lower), and higher τ (95 %
CIs: 1.1 to 4.3 higher) (G21).
Figure 2 shows violin plots for cloud properties as a
function of normalized height (ZN), deﬁned as ZN = Z −
−ZB/ZT −ZB. The violin plots include box plots and illus-
trate the distribution of the data (Hintze and Nelson, 1998).
The median Nc increased with ZN for ZN ≤0.25, consis-
tent with droplet nucleation (Fig. 2a). The median Nc de-
creased near cloud top for ZN ≥0.75 from 204 to 154 cm−3
for contact and from 104 to 69 cm−3 for separated proﬁles.
This is consistent with droplet evaporation associated with
cloud-top entrainment (G21). The median Re increased with
ZN consistent with condensational growth (Fig. 2b). There
was a greater increase in the median Re from cloud base to
cloud top for separated proﬁles (from 7.1 to 9.5 µm) com-
pared to contact proﬁles (from 6.1 to 7.9 µm). This is consis-
tent with previous observations of stronger droplet growth in
cleaner conditions as a function of ZN (Braun et al., 2018;
G21) and LWP (Rao et al., 2020). Statistically insigniﬁcant
differences between the average H for contact and separated
proﬁles suggest that the differential droplet growth was as-
sociated with differences in cloud processes like collision–
coalescence (further discussed in Sect. 5).
The LWC and LWP responses to changes in aerosol con-
ditions were examined because the adiabatic model suggests
ταLWP5/6 (Eq. 4) (Brenguier et al., 2000). Contact proﬁles
had signiﬁcantly higher LWC, but the relative increase was
less than 10 % (Table 4). LWC was divided into rainwater
content (RWC) and cloud water content (CWC) based on
droplet size. Droplets with D>50 µm were deﬁned as driz-
zle (Abel and Boutle, 2012; Boutle et al., 2014), and the
total drizzle mass was deﬁned as RWC. The droplet mass

for D<50 µm was deﬁned as CWC. Rainwater path (RWP)
and (cloud water path) CWP were deﬁned as the vertical in-
tegrals of RWC and CWC, respectively. The median CWC
increased with ZN but decreased over the top 10 % of the
cloud layer for contact proﬁles and over the top 20 % of

the cloud layer for separated proﬁles, consistent with cloud-
top entrainment (Fig. 2c). For contact proﬁles, the median
RWC increased with ZN before decreasing for ZN ≥0.75.
The median RWC for separated proﬁles varied with ZN.
The bottom half of the cloud layer had higher median val-
ues (up to 8.7 × 10−3 g m−3) compared to the top half (up to
7.0 × 10−3 g m−3) (Fig. 2d).
For contact proﬁles, there was a signiﬁcant increase in the
average CWC (10 %) and a signiﬁcant decrease in the aver-
age RWC (60 %) compared to separated proﬁles (Table 4).
Contact proﬁles also had signiﬁcantly lower average RWP
with insigniﬁcant differences for average CWP (Table 4).
Contact proﬁles were located in deeper boundary layers with
signiﬁcantly higher ZB and ZT compared to separated pro-
ﬁles. However, the decrease in RWC cannot be attributed to
differences in H or LWP (Kubar et al., 2009) because of sta-
tistically similar H and LWP for contact and separated pro-
ﬁles, on average (Table 4). These results show that instances
of contact between above-cloud aerosols and the MSC were
associated with more numerous and smaller cloud droplets
and weaker droplet growth compared to instances of separa-
tion between the above-cloud aerosols and the MSC.

Precipitation formation and H
The precipitation rate Rp was calculated using the drizzle
water content and fall velocity u(D) following Abel and
Boutle (2012):
Rp = π/6
∞
Z
50 µm
n(D)D3u(D)dD,
(5)
with fall velocity relationships from Rogers and Yau (1989)
used in the computation.
Contact proﬁles had signiﬁcantly lower Rp compared to
separated proﬁles (95 % CIs: 0.03 to 0.05 mm h−1 lower).
This suggests contact between the MSC and above-cloud
biomass burning aerosols was associated with precipitation
suppression. LWP and H impact the sign and magnitude of
the precipitation changes in response to changes in aerosol
conditions (Kubar et al., 2009; Christensen and Stephens,
2012). Thus, cloud and precipitation properties were eval-
uated as a function of H to examine the aerosol-induced
changes in precipitation formation.
The 95th percentile was used to represent the maximum
value of a variable. For example, the 95th percentile of
Rp (denoted by Rp95) represents the maximum Rp during
a cloud proﬁle. Although more numerous contact proﬁles
were drizzling compared to separated proﬁles, the latter had
more numerous proﬁles with high precipitation intensity.
For instance, 114 out of 173 contact and 95 out of 156
separated proﬁles were drizzling with Rp95>0.01 mm h−1,
out of which 36 contact and 40 separated proﬁles had
Rp95>0.1 mm h−1, and only 1 contact and 9 separated pro-
ﬁles had Rp95>1 mm h−1 (Fig. 3a). This is consistent with
radar retrievals of surface Rp<1 mm h−1 for over 93 % of the
radar proﬁles from 2016 and 2017 (Dzambo et al., 2019).

Microphysical properties
On
average,
separated
proﬁles
had
greater
Rp95
(0.22 mm h−1) compared to contact proﬁles (0.07 mm h−1).
Rp95 was positively correlated with H as thicker proﬁles
had higher precipitation intensity (Fig. 3a). The average
Rp95 increased from thin (H<175 m) to thick clouds
(H>175 m) from 0.04 to 0.10 mm h−1 for contact and 0.13
to 0.29 mm h−1 for separated proﬁles. Precipitation intensity
thus decreased from separated to contact proﬁles for both
thin and thick proﬁles. The average Rp95 for thin and thick
contact proﬁles was 32 % and 37 % of the average Rp95 for
thin and thick separated proﬁles, respectively.
CWC95 was positively correlated with H as thicker clouds
had higher droplet mass (Fig. 3b). This was consistent with
condensational and collision–coalescence growth continuing
to occur with greater height above cloud base (Fig. 2b, c)
and greater cloud depth allowing for greater droplet growth.
Nc95 and Re95 were negatively and positively correlated with
H, respectively (Fig. 3c, d). The trends in Nc and Re versus
H were consistent with the process of collision–coalescence
resulting in fewer and larger droplets.
On average, contact proﬁles had higher Nc95 and lower
Re95 (311 cm−3 and 8.6 µm) compared to separated proﬁles
(166 cm−3 and 10.8 µm). It can be inferred that the presence
of more numerous and smaller droplets during contact pro-
ﬁles decreased the efﬁciency of collision–coalescence. Al-
ternatively, there may not have been sufﬁcient time for the
updraft to produce the few large droplets needed to broaden
the size distribution and initiate collision–coalescence. Since
contact and separated proﬁles had statistically similar H (Ta-
ble 4), the following discussion examines the link between
precipitation suppression and the aerosol-induced changes in
Nc, Re, and LWC and their impact on precipitation.
5.2
Precipitation properties
Precipitation formation process rates were estimated using
equations used in numerical models to compare precipitation
formation between contact and separated proﬁles. Precipita-
tion development in models is parameterized using bulk mi-
crophysical schemes. General circulation models (GCMs) or
large eddy simulation (LES) models parameterize precipita-
tion formation using SAUTO and SACC (e.g., Penner et al.,
2006; Morrison and Gettelman, 2008; Gordon et al., 2018).
The most commonly used parameterizations were used to es-
timate equivalent rates of precipitation formation from mod-
els. SAUTO and SACC were calculated following Khairoutdi-
nov and Kogan (2000):

where wc and wr are cloud water and rainwater mixing ratios,

Contact proﬁles had signiﬁcantly lower SAUTO and SACC
compared to separated proﬁles (Table 4). This is consistent
with signiﬁcantly lower RWC and Rp for contact proﬁles
and the association of SAUTO and SACC with precipitation
onset and precipitation intensity, respectively. SAUTO95 and
SACC95 were positively correlated with H (Fig. 4a, b). Sep-
arated proﬁles had higher SAUTO95 and SACC95 (9.6 × 10−10

and 2.2×10−8 s−1) compared to contact proﬁles (2.9×10−10
and 1.2 × 10−8 s−1), associated with the inverse relationship
between SAUTO and Nc (Eq. 6). Faster autoconversion re-
sulted in higher drizzle water content and greater accretion
of droplets on drizzle drops.
The sampling of lower Nc95 and higher Re95 compared to
thinner proﬁles suggests that collision–coalescence was more
effective in proﬁles with higher H (Fig. 3c, d). Thin contact
proﬁles had the lowest SAUTO95 (1.4 × 10−10 s−1), followed
by thick contact (4.5 × 10−10 s−1), thin separated (4.7 ×
10−10 s−1), and thick separated proﬁles (1.4 × 10−9 s−1).
High Nc and low CWC for thin contact proﬁles (Fig. 3b,
c) are consistent with increased competition for cloud wa-
ter leading to weaker autoconversion. It is hypothesized
that these microphysical differences resulted in the lower
SAUTO95 and Rp95 for thin contact proﬁles compared to other
proﬁles. The differences between Rp for contact and sepa-
rated proﬁles thus varied with H in addition to Nc, Re, and
CWC. Nc, Re, and CWC varied with Na (Sect. 4), and ACIs
were examined in Sects. 6 and 7.

Polluted boundary layers in the Southeast Atlantic are asso-
ciated with entrainment mixing between the free troposphere
and the boundary layer (Diamond et al., 2018). Ground-
based observations from Ascension Island have shown clean
boundary layers can have elevated biomass burning trace
gas concentrations during the burning season (Pennypacker
et al., 2020). This suggests boundary layers could be clean
in terms of Na despite the entrainment of biomass burning
aerosols into the boundary layer due to precipitation scaveng-
ing of below-cloud aerosols. Carbon monoxide (CO) concen-
trations were examined since CO acts as a biomass burning
tracer that is unaffected by precipitation scavenging (Penny-
packer et al., 2020). For the 2016 IOP, contact proﬁles were
located in boundary layers with signiﬁcantly higher Na (95 %
CIs: 93 to 115 cm−3 higher) and CO (95 % CIs: 13 to 16 ppb
higher) compared to separated proﬁles (G21). This is consis-
tent with data from all three IOPs when contact proﬁles were
located in boundary layers with higher Na (95 % CIs: 231 to
249 cm−3 higher) and CO (95 % CIs: 27 to 29 ppb higher).
Following G21, 171 contact and 148 separated proﬁles
from the IOPs were classiﬁed into four regimes: contact, high
Na (C-H); contact, low Na (C-L); separated, high Na (S-H);
and separated, low Na (S-L), where “low Na” meant the pro-
ﬁle was in a boundary layer with Na<350 cm−3 up to 100 m
below cloud base. Boundary layer CO concentration above
100 ppb was sampled during 107 contact and 31 separated
proﬁles, respectively. Contact proﬁles were more often lo-
cated in high Na boundary layers (131 out of 171 proﬁles
classiﬁed as C-H), while separated proﬁles were more often
located in low Na boundary layers (108 out of 148 proﬁles
classiﬁed as S-L). This suggests contact between MSC cloud
tops and above-cloud biomass burning aerosols was associ-
ated with the entrainment of biomass burning aerosols into
the boundary layer.
Contact proﬁles had signiﬁcantly higher Nc and signiﬁ-
cantly lower Re relative to separated proﬁles in both high
Na (C-H relative to S-H) and low Na (C-L relative to S-L)
boundary layers (Fig. 5, Table 5). This was associated with
signiﬁcantly higher above- and below-cloud Na for the con-
tact proﬁles. The differences in Nc and Re were higher in
high Na boundary layers, where the differences in above- and
below-cloud Na were also higher compared to low Na bound-
ary layers (Table 5). This is consistent with previous obser-
vations of MSC properties (Diamond et al., 2018; Mardi et
al., 2019) and similar analysis for data from the 2016 IOP
(G21).
C-L proﬁles had signiﬁcantly higher Nc (95 % CIs: 5 to
14 cm−3 higher) compared to S-H proﬁles, despite having
signiﬁcantly lower below-cloud Na (95 % CIs: 69 to 85 cm−3
lower). Signiﬁcantly higher above-cloud Na for C-L proﬁles
(95 % CIs: 321 to 361 cm−3 higher) suggests that this was
associated with the inﬂuence of above-cloud Na on Nc. How-
ever, the smaller difference in Nc compared to the differences
between C-H and S-H or C-L and S-L proﬁles suggests the
combined impact of above- and below-cloud Na was stronger
than the impact of above-cloud Na alone. These compar-
isons were qualitatively consistent when thresholds of 300
or 400 cm−3 were used to deﬁne a low Na boundary layer.
6.2
Nc and Rp versus H
The cloud proﬁles were divided into four populations based
on H to compare Nc and Rp between different aerosols con-
ditions, while H was constrained. The populations were di-
vided at H = 129, 175, and 256 m to ensure similar sam-
ple sizes (Table 6). For each population, contact proﬁles had
higher Nc and lower Rp (Fig. 6a, b), consistent with compar-
isons averaged over all proﬁles (Table 4). Due to collision–
coalescence, the average Nc decreased, and the average Rp
increased with H (Fig. 6a, b). For contact proﬁles, the aver-
age Nc decreased with H from 221 to 191 cm−3, and the av-
erage Rp increased from 0.03 to 0.07 mm h−1. For separated
proﬁles, the average Nc decreased from 149 to 92 cm−3, and
the average Rp increased from 0.06 to 0.21 mm h−1 over the
same range of H. C-H proﬁles had the highest average Nc
and the lowest average Rp among the four regimes due to
high above- and below-cloud Na (Fig. 6c, d). C-H proﬁles
had the smallest increase in the average Rp with H (0.02 to
0.04 mm h−1). Conversely, low above- and below-cloud Na
for S-L proﬁles was associated with the lowest average Nc,
the highest average Rp, and the highest increase in the aver-
age Rp with H (0.12 to 0.29 mm h−1). For each regime, the
average Nc decreased with H (except C-L), and the average
Rp increased with H (Fig. 6c, d).

Precipitation susceptibility So
So was used to evaluate the dependence of Rp on Nc under
the different aerosol conditions. So, deﬁned as the negative
slope between the natural logarithms of Rp and Nc (Feingold
and Seibert, 2009), is given by
So = −dln(Rp)/dln(Nc),
(8)
where a positive value indicates decreasing Rp with increas-
ing Nc, in accordance with the “lifetime effect” (Albrecht,

1989). The average So across all proﬁles was 0.88 ± 0.03,
with lower So for contact proﬁles (0.87 ± 0.04) compared to
separated proﬁles (1.08 ± 0.04) (Table 6). This is consistent
with the hypothesis of lower values for So analogues (where
Nc in Eq. (8) is replaced by Na) in the presence of above-
cloud aerosols (Duong et al., 2011). So depends on the ratio
of SACC to SAUTO because SACC is independent of Nc, and
higher SACC/SAUTO represents weaker dependence of Rp on
Nc (Wood et al., 2009; Jiang et al., 2010). Lower So for con-

tact proﬁles was associated with higher SACC/SAUTO com-
pared to separated proﬁles (Table 4).
So was calculated as a function of H using Nc and Rp for
the four populations of cloud proﬁles (Fig. 7). The sensitivity
of So to the number of populations is discussed in Appendix
A. Averaged over all proﬁles, So had minor variations with H
(e.g., 0.67, 0.68, and 0.54 as H increased) before increasing
to 1.13 for H>256 m (Table 6). This trend in So versus H
is consistent with previous analyses of So (Sorooshian et al.,
2009; Jung et al., 2016). However, different trends emerged
when So was calculated for contact and separated proﬁles.
The largest difference between So for contact and sepa-
rated proﬁles was observed for thin clouds with H<129 m.
The 30 separated proﬁles with H<129 m had the highest So
(1.47±0.10) because of strong dependence of Rp on Nc. For

from contact and separated proﬁles with (a) 28<H<129 m,

these proﬁles, measurements with low Nc (<100 cm−3) had
higher Rp (0.18 mm h−1) compared to measurements with
higher Nc (0.01 mm h−1) (Fig. 8a). In contrast, the 52 con-
tact proﬁles with H<129 m had a low and statistically in-
signiﬁcant value for So (−0.06 ± 0.11) due to poor (and sta-
tistically insigniﬁcant) correlation (R = −0.03). Poor corre-
lation between Nc and Rp for contact proﬁles was associated
with precipitation suppression and weaker droplet growth
(Sect. 5). These factors resulted in Rp<0.03 mm h−1 inde-
pendent of the Nc measurement (Fig. 8a).
For separated proﬁles, So decreased with H from 1.47 ±
0.10 for H<129 m to 0.53±0.09 for 129<H<175 m and to
0.34 ± 0.07 for 175<H<256 m (Fig. 7a). This was due to
the increase in average Rp for high Nc measurements as a
function of H from 0.01 mm h−1 to 0.05 and 0.04 mm h−1,
respectively. Rp increased with H due to stronger collision–
coalescence as droplet mass increased with H. Separated
proﬁles with H>256 m had lower Nc and higher Rp com-
pared to the populations with lower H (Fig. 6a, b). For mea-
surements with low Nc, collision–coalescence and stronger
autoconversion (following Eq. 6) resulted in higher Rp
(0.26 mm h−1) compared to measurements with higher Nc
(0.13 mm h−1). This led to a strong gradient Rp as a function

of Nc (Fig. 8d), and So increased to 1.45±0.07 for separated
proﬁles with H>256 m.
For contact proﬁles with H>129 m, the average Rp in-
creased with H, with a larger increase for measurements with
low Nc (0.028 to 0.12 mm h−1) compared to measurements
with high Nc (0.03 to 0.06 mm h−1). It is hypothesized that
collision–coalescence was hindered by the presence of more
numerous droplets for the latter. With droplet growth and
collision–coalescence for higher H, the limiting factor for
Rp changed from H to Nc. The dependence of Rp on Nc thus
increased with H, and, as a result, So increased with H from
0.88 ± 0.06 to 1.15 ± 0.06 (Fig. 7a).
Among the four regimes deﬁned based on the above- and
below-cloud Na, S-L proﬁles had the highest So (1.12) (Ta-
ble 7). This was associated with S-L proﬁles having the low-
est Nc and the highest Rp among the regimes (Fig. 6c, d). In
descending order of So, S-L proﬁles were followed by C-L
(0.86), S-H (0.50), and C-H proﬁles (0.33). Proﬁles in low
Na boundary layers (S-L and C-L) had higher So compared
to proﬁles in high Na boundary layers (S-H and C-H), con-
sistent with wet scavenging of below-cloud aerosols (Duong
et al., 2011; Jung et al., 2016).
C-L and C-H proﬁles had similar trends in So except for
proﬁles with H<129 m (Fig. 7b). C-L proﬁles had an in-
signiﬁcant value for So due to low sample size (4), and C-H
proﬁles had negative So. These were thin proﬁles with little
cloud water (Fig. 4b), high Nc (Fig. 6c), and low Rp (Fig. 6d).
It is hypothesized that increasing Nc would provide the cloud
water required for precipitation initiation and aid collision–
coalescence. A total of 107 out of 148 separated proﬁles were
classiﬁed as S-L proﬁles. As a result, separated and S-L pro-
ﬁles had similar trends in So versus H (Fig. 7). On average,
S-L proﬁles had higher So than S-H proﬁles, which could be
associated with wet scavenging, resulting in the lower below-
cloud Na for S-L proﬁles. For S-H proﬁles, So was constant
with H at about 0.45 (except 175<H<256 m when the value
for So was insigniﬁcant).
The sensitivity of So to removal of clouds based on Rp
was examined in Appendix B. The removal of clouds with
low Rp and high Nc or with high Rp and low Nc resulted in
lower average So consistent with previous work (Duong et
al., 2011). The So comparisons between proﬁles located in
high Na or low Na boundary layers varied with the sample
sizes of the populations. The sample sizes varied based on
the threshold used to deﬁne a low Na boundary layer which
is discussed in Appendix C. CAS data were used to represent
measurements of droplets with D<50 µm collected during
ORACLES 2016 in the absence of CDP data. The sensitivity
of So to the use of CAS data was examined in Appendix D.
6.4
So discussion
Figure 9 shows how So varied with perturbations (1) in Nc
or Rp. Previous studies hypothesized that increasing above-
cloud Na or precipitation scavenging of below-cloud Na
Figure 9. An illustration of the dependence of So on Nc, Rp, and
perturbations (1) in Nc or Rp.
would lead to changes in So (Fig. 4, Duong et al., 2011;
Fig. 11, Jung et al., 2016). Thus, 1Nc and 1Rp for clouds
with variable above- and below-cloud Na were quantiﬁed
in this study (Table 5). Higher Nc and lower Re for con-
tact proﬁles led to precipitation suppression along with lower
SAUTO, SACC, and Rp, which were associated with lower So
compared to separated proﬁles. As a result, polluted clouds
were 20 % less susceptible to precipitation suppression than
cleaner clouds. Figure 9 shows that the impact of 1Nc or
1Rp on So depends on the original values for Nc and Rp as
the same 1Nc and 1Rp can have an opposing effect on So.
For example, a decrease in Nc at point 1 would decrease the
slope and the So value, while the same decrease in Nc at point
2 would increase the slope and the So value.
Both average and maximum Nc and Rp varied with H
due to increasing aerosols (Sect. 4) and droplet growth
due to collision–coalescence, autoconversion, and accretion
(Sect. 5). Further, co-variability between droplet growth pro-
cesses and ACIs meant aerosol-induced 1Nc and 1Rp varied
with H (Sect. 6.2). Consequently, the differences between So
for clean and polluted clouds varied with H. The change in
So was highest for thin polluted clouds due to poor corre-
lation between Nc and Rp as limited droplet growth led to
low Rp regardless of the Nc. Future work must examine the
co-variability between 1Nc or 1Rp from cloud processes
such as droplet growth, entrainment, invigoration, precipita-
tion, and 1Nc or 1Rp due to ACIs. Model parameterizations
with power-law relationships between Rp, Nc, and H (Geof-
froy et al., 2008) must account for changes in the dependence
of Rp on Nc/H due to increasing aerosols or H.
The trends in So were only compared with studies ana-
lyzing airborne data due to the variability in So depending
on whether aircraft, remote sensing, or modeling data were
examined (Sorooshian et al., 2019). Consistent with Terai et
al. (2012), So decreased with H for separated proﬁles with
H<256 m. The results from Sect. 5 suggest droplet growth
with H decreased the susceptibility to aerosols because Rp
was limited by droplet growth instead of Na or Nc. In com-

parison, So increased with H for contact proﬁles, consistent
with Jung et al. (2016). The low So for thin contact proﬁles
was consistent with the low So (0.06) for thin MSC over the
southeast Paciﬁc (Jung et al., 2016). This was attributed to
insufﬁcient cloud water for precipitation initiation (as noted
in Sect. 5). An airborne investigation of marine stratocumu-
lus off the Californian coast attributed negative values of So
to the inﬂuence of giant cloud condensation nuclei (Dadas-
hazar et al., 2017). The authors hypothesized that the low
statistical signiﬁcance of the negative estimate of So could
be associated with precipitation suppression by aerosol par-
ticles.
Jung et al. (2016) analyzed MSC sampled farther east and
away from South America compared to Terai et al. (2012).
They argued a westward increase in precipitation frequency
and intensity, along with a decrease in aerosols and Nc, led
to the differences between the two studies. This same attri-
bution of the role of aerosols can be made for the ORA-
CLES data as there were differences between contact and
separated proﬁles because the MSCs sampled during these
proﬁles were located in similar geographical locations with
different aerosol conditions. Modeling studies (e.g., Wood
et al., 2009; Gettelman et al., 2013) have shown that So in-
creases with H when SAUTO dominates SACC (typically for
Re<14 µm, the critical radius for precipitation initiation).
Maximum Re<14 µm was sampled during all but 23 sepa-
rated and 3 contact proﬁles (Fig. 4d). This would explain the
increase in So with H for both contact (for H>129 m) and
separated proﬁles (for H>256 m).
7
Meteorological inﬂuence on LWP
The relationships between LWP or H and Nc, Re, and
LWC depend on meteorological conditions in addition to
aerosol properties. The MSC LWP and cloud cover can vary
with LTS (Klein and Hartmann, 1993; Mauger and Nor-
ris, 2007), estimated inversion strength (EIS) (Wood and
Bretherton, 2006), and SST (Wilcox, 2010; Sakaeda et al.,
2011). The correlations between LWP / H and these param-
eters are examined using the European Centre for Medium-
Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) atmospheric reanalysis
(ERA5) (Hersbach et al., 2020) to deﬁne the meteorological
conditions.
ERA5 provides hourly output with a horizontal resolution
of 0.25◦×0.25◦for 37 pressure (p) levels (up to 1 hPa). The
cloud sampling for most ﬂights was conducted within 3 h of
12:00 UTC (Table 2). ERA5 data at 12:00 UTC were thus
used for the grid box nearest to the proﬁle (Dzambo et al.,
2019). The low cloud cover (LCC), SST, HBL, total column
liquid water (ERA5 LWP) and rainwater (ERA5 RWP), mean
sea level pressure (po), 2 m temperature (To), and 2 m dew
point temperature (Td) were examined (Table 8).
The difference between potential temperatures at 700 hPa
and the surface was deﬁned as LTS (Klein and Hartmann,
1993). EIS was calculated following Wood and Brether-
ton (2006):
EIS = LTS−0850
m (z700 −LCL), LCL = 125 (To −Td), (9)
where 0m is the moist adiabatic potential temperature gradi-
ent, z700 is the height at 700 mb, and LCL is the lifting con-
densation level (Lawrence, 2005). 0850
m
is 0m for 850 hPa
and calculated following Wood and Bretherton (2006).
LCC refers to cloud fraction for p>0.8po, correspond-
ing to p>810 hPa, where most proﬁles were sampled (Ta-
ble 2). The ECMWF model used a threshold of EIS >7 K
to distinguish between well-mixed boundary layers topped
by stratocumulus and decoupled boundary layers with cu-
mulus clouds (ECMWF, 2020). This distinction improved
the agreement between the model LCC and LWP and ob-
servations (Köhler et al., 2011). LCC was proportional to
EIS / LTS, and LCC <0.8 was mostly observed for EIS <7 K
(Fig. 10a). Decoupled boundary layers can be topped by
MSC (G21; Wood, 2012). Proﬁles with EIS <7 K were in-
cluded in the analysis if ERA5 had LCC >0.95. This in-
cluded 64 contact and 88 separated proﬁles from the three
IOPs. For the 2016, 2017, and 2018 IOPs, 50, 20, and 76 pro-
ﬁles, respectively, had LCC >0.95 out of which 0, 4, and 44
proﬁles, respectively, had EIS <7 K. The average ERA5 HBL
(599±144 m) was lower than the average ZT (932±196 m).
This underestimation of HBL by ERA5 has been observed
for stratocumulus over the southeast and northeast Paciﬁc
(Ahlgrimm et al., 2009; Hannay et al., 2009).
On average, the ERA5 LWP (51 ± 21 g m−2) was slightly
greater than LWP (46 ± 41 g m−2), but the differences
were statistically insigniﬁcant. There was a signiﬁcant but
weak correlation between LWP and ERA5 LWP (R = 0.18)

and panel (b) shows cloud proﬁles with LCC >0.95.
(Fig. 10b). On average, the ERA5 RWP (0.48 ± 1.07 g m−2)
was lower than RWP (1.19 ± 2.76 g m−2). There were in-
signiﬁcant differences between ERA5 LWP and LWP for
contact and separated proﬁles with LCC >0.95 (Table 8).
Contact proﬁles with LCC >0.95 had signiﬁcantly higher
ERA5 RWP (Table 8). While this is counterintuitive, given
the precipitation suppression, it was due to the selection of
proﬁles with LCC >0.95. Contact proﬁles with LCC >0.95
also had higher in situ RWP (95 % CIs: 0.32 to 2.08 g m−2
higher) compared to separated proﬁles with LCC >0.95.
LWP was positively correlated with SST and To and nega-
tively correlated with LTS and EIS with weak but statistically
signiﬁcant correlations (Fig. 11). On average, separated pro-
ﬁles had signiﬁcantly higher SST (95 % CIs: 0.01 to 1.48 K
higher) compared to contact proﬁles with insigniﬁcant dif-
ferences between the average To, EIS, and LTS. Since the
correlation between LWP / H and SST was weak, it is un-
likely the differences between contact and separated proﬁles
were driven by SST differences alone. When all proﬁles (ir-
respective of LCC) were considered, there were insigniﬁcant
differences between the average ERA5 RWP, SST, To, EIS,
and LTS for contact and separated proﬁles. This suggests the
differences between contact and separated proﬁles found dur-
ing the ORACLES IOPs were primarily associated with ACIs
instead of meteorological effects.

Conclusions
In situ measurements of stratocumulus over the Southeast
Atlantic Ocean were collected during the NASA ORACLES
ﬁeld campaign. The microphysical (Nc and Re), macrophysi-
cal (LWP and H), and precipitation properties (Rp and So) of
the stratocumulus were analyzed. A total of 173 contact pro-
ﬁles with Na>500 cm−3 within 100 m above cloud tops were
compared with 156 separated proﬁles with Na<500 cm−3 up
to at least 100 m above cloud tops. Contact between above-
cloud aerosols and the stratocumulus was associated with the
following:
1. More numerous and smaller droplets with weaker
droplet growth with height.
Contact proﬁles had signiﬁcantly higher Nc (84 to
90 cm−3 higher) and lower Re (1.4 to 1.6 µm lower)
compared to separated proﬁles. The median Re had a
smaller increase from cloud base to cloud top for con-
tact (6.1 to 7.9 µm) compared to separated proﬁles (7.1
to 9.5 µm). The proﬁles had similar LWP and H, and it
is hypothesized the differences in droplet growth were
associated with collision–coalescence.
2. Aerosol-induced cloud microphysical changes in both
clean and polluted boundary layers.
Contact proﬁles had 25 to 31 cm−3 higher Nc and 0.2 to
0.5 µm lower Re in clean and 98 to 108 cm−3 higher

Nc and 1.6 to 1.8 µm lower Re in polluted boundary
layers compared to separated proﬁles. Contact proﬁles
were more often located in polluted boundary layers and
had higher below-cloud CO concentration (27 to 29 ppb
higher), which suggests more frequent entrainment of
biomass burning aerosols into the boundary layer com-
pared to separated proﬁles.
3. Precipitation suppression with signiﬁcantly lower pre-
cipitation intensity and precipitation formation process
rates.
Separated proﬁles had Rp up to 0.22 mm h−1, while
contact proﬁles had Rp up to 0.07 mm h−1. SAUTO and
SACC had higher maxima for separated (up to 9.6 ×
10−10 and 2.2×10−8 s−1) compared to contact proﬁles
(up to 2.9 × 10−10 and 1.2 × 10−8 s−1).
4. Lower precipitation susceptibility, with the strongest
impact in thin clouds (H<129 m).
Contact proﬁles had lower So (0.87 ± 0.04) compared
to separated proﬁles (1.08 ± 0.04). Thin clouds had the
highest difference in So (−0.06 ± 0.11 for contact and
1.47 ± 0.10 for separated). Lower So for thin contact
proﬁles was associated with poor correlation between
Nc and Rp (R = −0.03). For separated proﬁles, So de-
creased with H before increasing for H>256 m. In
comparison, So increased with H for contact proﬁles
for H>129 m.
5. Statistically insigniﬁcant differences in meteorological
parameters that inﬂuence LWP/H.
Based on ERA5 reanalysis data, LWP was correlated
with SST (R = 0.22), To (R = 0.27), LTS (R = −0.29),
and EIS (R = −0.31). Contact proﬁles with ERA5
LCC >0.95 had lower SST (0.01 to 1.48 K lower), with
similar To, LTS, and EIS compared to separated pro-
ﬁles. The SST differences were insigniﬁcant when pro-
ﬁles with LCC <0.95 were included in the comparison.
Three important factors affecting So were discussed
(Sorooshian et al., 2019): above-cloud Na, below-cloud Na,
and meteorological conditions. This study analyzed ORA-
CLES data from all three IOPs, and the ﬁrst two conclusions
were consistent with the analysis of ORACLES 2016 (Gupta
et al., 2021). Future work will compare in situ data with Rp
retrievals from APR-3 (Dzambo et al., 2021) to evaluate the
sensitivity of So to the use of satellite retrievals of Rp (Bai et
al., 2018). Vertical proﬁles of MSC properties will be used
to evaluate satellite retrievals (Painemal and Zuidema, 2011;
Zhang and Platnick, 2011) to address the uncertainties asso-
ciated with satellite-based estimates of ACIs (Quaas et al.,
2020). The ORACLES dataset can be combined with future
investigations of marine stratocumulus to address the “lack of
long-term datasets needed to provide statistical signiﬁcance
for a sufﬁciently large range of aerosol variability inﬂuencing
speciﬁc cloud regimes over a range of macrophysical condi-
tions” (Sorooshian et al., 2010).

Appendix A: Sensitivity studies on dependence of So
on H
The base analysis examined how cloud properties varied with
H by separating cloud proﬁles into four populations of H us-
ing the following endpoints: 28, 129, 175, 256, and 700 m.
Two sensitivity studies determine if trends describing the
variation of Nc, Rp, and So with H were sensitive to the end-
points used to sort cloud proﬁles into different populations.
First, cloud proﬁles were classiﬁed into two populations
using the median H (175 m) to divide the populations (Ta-
ble A1). The average Nc decreased, and the average Rp in-
creased with H for both contact (211 to 186 cm−3 and 0.03
to 0.07 mm h−1) and separated proﬁles (129 to 104 cm−3 and
0.07 to 0.15 mm h−1). So increased with H for contact pro-
ﬁles from 0.53 to 1.06 and slightly decreased with H for
separated proﬁles from 1.05 to 1.02 (Table A1). The dif-
ference between So for contact and separated proﬁles was
greater for thin proﬁles (H<175 m) compared to thick pro-
ﬁles (H>175 m). These results are consistent with trends us-
ing four populations but provide less detail about how So
varies with H (Fig. A1).
Figure A1. So as a function of H for contact and separated proﬁles
classiﬁed into different populations using the endpoints indicated in
legend. So was statistically insigniﬁcant when marked with a cross.
Second, cloud proﬁles were classiﬁed into three popula-
tions using the terciles of H (145 and 224 m) (Table A1). The
average Nc decreased, and the average Rp increased from the
lowest to the highest H for contact (231 to 187 cm−3 and
0.03 to 0.07 mm h−1) and separated proﬁles (138 to 95 cm−3
and 0.06 to 0.18 mm h−1). For separated proﬁles, So ﬁrst de-
creased with H from 1.15 to 0.25 before increasing to 1.45
for the highest H (Fig. A1). Contact proﬁles had insignif-
icant So for the lowest H, followed by So increasing from
0.95 to 1.08 with H. The results presented here are robust
with regards to the number of populations used.

Appendix B: Sensitivity studies on dependence of So
on Rp
Another sensitivity study examined the Rp threshold used for
cloud proﬁles included while calculating So. The average So
decreased if weakly precipitating clouds with low Rp were
excluded (Fig. B1, Table B1). It is possible that this was due
to the higher Na and Nc associated with weakly precipitat-
ing clouds. The exclusion of weakly precipitating clouds pro-
vides biased trends in So since these clouds could have under-
gone precipitation suppression already. Conversely, strongly
precipitating clouds were associated with cleaner conditions
and lower Na and Nc. The exclusion of strongly precipitating
clouds also leads to a decrease in the average So (Fig. B2,
Table B1).
The occurrence of wet scavenging below strongly precip-
itating clouds (Duong et al., 2011) results in lower below-
cloud Na (and subsequently Nc). Higher susceptibility to
precipitation suppression for cleaner, strongly precipitating
clouds would explain the increase in the average So. This is
consistent with observations of So using different Rp thresh-
olds (see Fig B1, Jung et al., 2016) and hypotheses regarding
the impact of different Na on So (Duong et al., 2011; Fig. 11,
Jung et al., 2016).

Appendix C: Dependence of So on the deﬁnition of
clean and polluted boundary layers
The number of cloud proﬁles classiﬁed into the S-L, C-L,
S-H, and C-H regimes varied depending on the below-cloud
Na threshold used to deﬁne a low Na or clean boundary layer.
For the threshold used in the base analysis (350 cm−3), con-
tact proﬁles were more often located in polluted boundary
layers (131 out of 171 proﬁles classiﬁed as C-H) while sep-
arated proﬁles were more often located in clean boundary
layers (108 out of 148 proﬁles classiﬁed as S-L). The com-
parisons between So in clean and polluted boundary layers
varied with the threshold used.
As a sensitivity study, a lower threshold was used to de-
ﬁne a clean boundary layer (300 cm−3). For this case, the
C-L regime had no proﬁles in the population with the low-
est H (H<129 m) when four populations of proﬁles were
used to examine the dependence of So on H. Two out of the
other three populations had an insigniﬁcant value for So due
to poor and statistically insigniﬁcant correlations between Nc
and Rp (Table C1). This was associated with a low sam-
ple size for the populations (six each). A second sensitiv-
ity study used a higher threshold to deﬁne a clean boundary
layer (400 cm−3). For this case, the S-H regime has insignif-
icant So for three out of the four populations of H and the
remaining population had a small sample size (three proﬁles)
(Table C1). The base analysis using a threshold of 350 cm−3
to deﬁne a clean boundary layer was used to compare So val-
ues that represent a larger number of cloud proﬁles.

Appendix D: Sensitivity of So to the use of CAS data
from ORACLES 2016
Given the differences between the CAS and PDI Nc and
LWC for droplets with D<50 µm during ORACLES 2016
(see Supplement), sensitivity tests were performed by ﬁrst
excluding ORACLES 2016 data and second by using PDI
data to represent ORACLES 2016 size distributions for
D<50 µm in the So calculations. These sensitivity tests
resulted in minor changes in the trends of So versus H
(Fig. D1), along with average changes in the magnitude of
So up to 0.05 (Table D1). The noted changes suggest that the
discussion of trends in So described in this study is robust as
it relates to the inclusion of ORACLES 2016 data and the use
of CAS data for the deployment. Since the 2016 deployment
contributed about a third of the ORACLES measurements,
data from the 2016 deployment were included in the study
so as not to reduce the size of the dataset.
The slight decrease in So for thick clouds (H>256 m)
upon removal of ORACLES 2016 data is associated with
a decrease in the number of thick clouds (Table D1). The
use of PDI data resulted in minor changes because So pri-
marily depends on Nc and Rp. The CAS and PDI datasets
had small differences in the average Nc (95 % conﬁdence
intervals of 9 to 12 cm−3), and Rp was calculated using
droplets with D>50 µm, which do not include contributions
from either the CAS or the PDI. The documentation of dif-
ferences between the ORACLES cloud probes (see Supple-
ment) highlights the measurement uncertainties associated
with the cloud probe datasets.
