ABSTRACT
Introduction: Although resistance training (RT) can provide numerous benefits for both men and women, 
morphological, neuromuscular, metabolic, physiological, and behavioral differences between sexes may in­
fluence the magnitude of training responses. Objective: To analyze the impact of 16 weeks of progressive RT on 
strength endurance in untrained men and women. Methods: Twenty-eight men and 31 women (18-30 years) 
underwent a supervised RT program that was divided into two 8-week stages, 3 times per week on nonconse­
cutive days. The RT program was composed of exercises for different body segments (trunk, upper and lower 
limbs) that were performed with three sets of 8-12 repetitions maximum (RM), in 10 and 12 exercises, in the 
first and second stage, respectively. Strength endurance was assessed in 3 exercises (bench press, squat, and 
arm curl) and in a combination of these exercises through a protocol composed of 4 sets performed to failure 
with 80% of 1-RM on the baseline, after 8 and 16 weeks of RT. Results: Group vs. time interactions (p <0.05) were 
found for bench press (men = +28.3% vs. women = +32.1%), squat (men = +13.5% vs. women = +32.7%), and 
arm curl (men = +20.2% vs. women = +24.4%) exercises, as well as in the set of all 3 exercises (men = +18.4% 
vs. women = +31.2%). Conclusion: Our results suggest that 16 weeks of RT can improve strength endurance 
in both men and women, although higher gains are achieved by women. Level of evidence II; Therapeutic

INTRODUCTION
Increased strength endurance is related to improved fatigue resis­
tance1,2 and can be acquired through regular resistance training (RT), a 
mode of physical exercise widely practiced by young men and women, 
especially to improve body esthetics and the ability to generate muscular 
strength, endurance, and power3. However, many of the responses indu­
ced by RT appear to be sex-dependent1-5 due to differences in muscular 
strength and mass, hormonal regulation, muscular architecture, energy 
storage, use of energy substrates, the muscular recovery process, and 
motor unit recruitment patterns, while other adaptive responses manifest 
themselves regardless of sex.2,4,6-10
Salvador et al.1 revealed the presence of sexual dimorphism in stren­
gth endurance in women presenting a better response than men in 
multiple sets to failure, with 80% of one-repetition maximum (1-RM) 
after eight weeks of RT. On the other hand, the fatigue index improved 
similarly in both groups. These results were partially confirmed by Ri­
beiro et al.,2 who found the presence of sexual dimorphism in fatigue 
resistance in exercises for the trunk (better result in women) but not in 
exercises for the upper limbs after 16 weeks of RT. Nonetheless, several 
studies that have compared physical performance between the sexes 
in different motor tasks revealed that women have greater strength 
endurance than men in different types of contraction, speed, position, 
age groups, and exercises.11-16
These findings are still not definitive due to the lack of a better me­
thodological control of different factors that may interfere in responses 
to RT, such as the structure and duration of the training protocol, the 
subjects’ level of physical fitness, and the forms of overload progression 
over time. Thus, this study aims to analyze the effect of 16 weeks of RT 
on strength endurance in men and women. Our hypothesis is that 
women will gain a greater magnitude of strength endurance than men 
in similar RT programs, as it appears that maximum strength gains and 
the magnitude of training load progression over time tend to be larger 
in women.1,2,10
METHODS
We developed this study over the course of 22 weeks. The partici­
pants were given two weeks to become familiar with the exercises in 
the RT program and for initial measurements and assessments (weeks 
1 and 2). We designated eight weeks for RT in stage 1 (weeks 3 to 10). 
We dedicated two weeks for intermediate measurements and reasses­
sments (weeks 11 and 12). Eight weeks were allocated for RT in stage 2 
(weeks 13 to 20). Two weeks were set aside for final measurements and 
assessments (weeks 21 and 22). We analyzed the performance in 1-RM 
tests and strength endurance protocols in this study.
We selected the participants by reaching out to the public through 
posters and social media. We created a list containing the volunteers’ 
personal information and subsequently scheduled individual interviews. 
During the interviews, several questions were used to analyze whether

or not the candidate met the inclusion criteria established for this study.
To be included, participants must be between the ages of 18 and
30 years; must not have had musculoskeletal injuries that prevented 
them from performing RT tests and sessions; must not have taken pro­
tein or creatine supplements or anabolic steroids; must not have been 
vegetarian; and must not have practiced RT regularly throughout the 
six months prior to the start of the study. We excluded participants who 
were absent from 15% of the RT sessions and/or adhered to another 
exercise programs during the experiment. After the participants were 
informed of the procedures, they signed an informed consent form. 
This study was part of a longitudinal project that analyzed the effect of 
creatine supplementation on morphological and motor performance 
indicators in young men and women and has been approved by the 
Research Ethics Committee of Londrina State University (Report No. 
028/2012), in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
We measured body mass using a digital platform scale (Urano, PS 
180A model; Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil), rounded to the nearest 0.1 kg, and 
determined height using a wooden stadiometer, rounded to the nearest 
0.1 cm, according to the procedures described in the literature.17 We 
calculated body mass index (BMI) from the ratio between body mass 
(kg) and the square of the height (m).
We determined maximum strength by using 1-RM tests of three 
exercises: the bench press, squat, and arm curl. The 1-RM tests were 
preceded by a warm-up set (6 to 10 repetitions) with approximately 
50% of the load to be tested in the first attempt in each exercise. The 
participant initiated their first attempt two minutes after warming up. 
Participants were instructed to try to complete two repetitions. After 
an interval of three to five minutes, there was a second attempt with a 
load greater or less than the one in the previous attempt, depending 
on whether the participant completed two repetitions or did not even 
complete one repetition, respectively. The same procedure was repeated 
on a third attempt. We recorded the maximum load that the individual 
could complete in one single voluntary muscular action as the 1-RM. 
The transition interval between exercises was five minutes. The form 
and technique of execution for each exercise were standardized and 
continuously monitored in an attempt to ensure the quality data. The 
participants always performed the tests at the three different stages 
of the study at the same time of the day and refrained from physical 
exercise during the weeks for the 1-RM tests. In an attempt to reduce the 
learning curve and establish test reproducibility in the three exercises, 
there were three familiarization sessions, separated by intervals of 48 
to 72 hours, in the three assessment stages.18 The intraclass correlation 
coefficient (ICC) for each of the three exercises was greater than 0.98. 
The sum of the total load lifted (TLL) in the three exercises was used as 
an indicator of overall strength.
A protocol to assess strength endurance was applied 48 to 72 hours 
after participants performed the 1-RM tests in the three exercises des­
cribed above. The order in which the exercises were executed in this 
protocol was the same as the order adopted for the 1-RM tests. The 
401
Rev Bras Med Esporte – Vol. 25, No 5 – Set/Out, 2019
protocol consisted of executing four sets of each exercise at 80% of 1-RM 
to voluntary exhaustion. Participants were instructed to try to execute 
as many repetitions as possible in each of the sets until there was a 
functional inability to overcome the resistance. The rest interval between 
sets was two minutes, and the transition period between exercises was 
three to five minutes. The three exercises were preceded by a warm-up 
set (6-10 repetitions with approximately 50% of the load established for 
each exercise). We determined strength endurance by the total volume 
of effort (load X repetitions) and analyzed it separately in each of the 
three exercises and in combination by the total absolute volume (TAV).
The RT program was structured based on recommendations in the 
literature19 and conducted in three weekly sessions on alternate days. 
Physical education professionals supervised the participants individually 
in all training sessions. The RT protocol was divided into two stages of 
eight consecutive weeks, which were set apart by two-week intervals 
that were designated for reassessments and restructuring of the training 
programs. In both stages, the muscular hypertrophy process was the 
focus. We adopted an alternate setup per segment in the first stage 
and a pivotal setup in the second. The training program in the first 
stage included 10 exercises, while the second stage contained 12. Each 
exercise was executed in 3 sets of 8-12 RMs with fixed loads, except the 
exercises for the calf (15-20 RMs) and abdominal (30-50 RMs) muscle 
groups. The rest interval between sets was 60 to 90 seconds, while the 
interval between exercises was 120 to 180 seconds. The loads applied 
corresponded to 60-85% of 1-RM and were readjusted whenever the 
participant reached the maximum number of pre-established repetitions 
in all the sets for each exercise. We determined both the initial loads 
and the periodic readjustments to the loads applied by the repetition 
maximum weight test.9 The subjects were instructed not to perform any 
other type of regular systematic physical activity and to maintain their 
eating habits throughout the duration of the study so that the impact 
of RT could be assessed in isolation.
We used the Shapiro-Wilk test to analyze the distribution of data. We 
adopted the Levene test to examine the homogeneity of the variances 
and the Mauchly test to verify sphericity. In cases where sphericity was 
violated, the analyses were adjusted by using the Greenhouse-Geisser 
correction. We used the Student’s t-test to compare the general cha­
racteristics of the groups at the baseline. We applied the analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) to compare the groups (men and women) over 
the training period (baseline, after 8 and 16 weeks of RT) and used the 
baseline measurements as covariates. We adopted the Bonferroni post hoc 
test to detect differences when P <0.05. We calculated the magnitude of 
the size of the differences by the effect size (ES).20 We considered an ES 
of 0.00–0.19 to be trivial and 0.20-0.49 to be small, while an effect size of 
0.50-0.79 was moderate and ≥0.80 was high.20 The data were stored and 
analyzed in SPSS for Windows, version 23.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), 
and STATISTICA for Windows, version 10.0 (StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA).
RESULTS
The women presented lower values for body mass, height, and BMI 
than the men (Table 1).
Group vs. time interactions (P <0.05) indicated increased muscular 
strength over the course of 16 weeks of RT (Table 2) in the bench press 
(men = + 12.9% vs. women = + 24.1%), squat (men = + 26.2% vs. women 
= + 23.6%), arm curl (men = + 14.8% vs. women = + 21.5%), and TLL 
(men = + 19.9% vs. women = + 23.3%). Increases in muscular strength 
occurred progressively and were identified within the first eight weeks 
of the intervention (P < 0.05). The muscular strength gains resulted in 
a high ES for both men and women in all the variables we analyzed
(0.87 - 1.54), except for men in the bench press exercise (moderate effect).
We found a progressive improvement in strength endurance in 
both groups (Table 3), with significant differences after eight weeks of RT
(P < 0.05). Group vs. time interactions (P < 0.05) were identified in 
the bench press (men = + 28.3% vs. women = + 32.1%), squat (men 
= + 13.5% vs. women = + 32.7%), arm curl (men = + 20.2% vs. wo­
men = + 24.4%), and TAV (men = + 18.4% vs. women = + 31.2%). 
Improved strength endurance resulted in an ES of high magnitude 
(0.84 - 1.27), except for men in the squat exercise (small effect) and 
in TAV (moderate effect).
DISCUSSION
The main finding of this study was that the increase in strength en­
durance brought on by 16 weeks of RT correlated with the improvement 
in maximum strength in both men and women. However, the gains 
observed in women were higher than those found in men, confirming 
our hypothesis of the presence of sexual dimorphism for both strength 
endurance and maximum strength.
The increase in muscular strength caused by RT in men and women 
under the same RT protocol has already been documented in previous 
studies, lasting eight1,6 and sixteen weeks.2,5,10 Nevertheless, to our kno­
wledge, this is the first study that analyzed the behavior of maximum 
strength and strength endurance on different body segments based on 
sex, allowing us to observe the behavior of these variables after eight 
and sixteen weeks. Therefore, we examined the responses by considering

the training progression used in both periods. Our results indicated the 
presence of sexual dimorphism for both maximum strength and strength 
endurance in different body segments.
The gains in muscular strength made by untrained individuals in the 
first weeks of RT have been associated mainly with neural adaptations, 
with a discrete contribution to the hypertrophy process.21 The increased 
cross-sectional area of the muscle fibers seems to contribute more mar­
kedly to the increase in strength production only after six to eight weeks 
of training.22 Some of the potential mechanisms associated with muscular 
strength gains identified in the first weeks of RT include the increased 
recruitment of high-threshold motor units, the increased frequency of 
motor unit discharges and synchronization, better coordination between 
agonist and antagonist muscles, and/or reduction in antagonist muscle 
coactivation.23 In this study, the greatest strength gains occurred in the 
first eight weeks of the intervention for both sexes. However, Lemmer 
et al.24 evidenced an increase in strength only in women after 9 weeks 
of unilateral strength training. This result suggests that neural responses 
may be processed with differentiated motor unit recruitment patterns 
in men and women. This fact may at least partially explain the greater 
gains in maximum strength found in the women of this study for the 
three exercises.
Additionally, Martel et al.25 identified an increase in the proportion 
of type I fibers and a simultaneous decrease in type IIX fibers in women 
after 9 weeks of RT. This finding strengthens the hypothesis that in short 
intervention periods, neural adaptations play a more important role 
than muscular hypertrophy for strength gains and, probably, strength 
endurance, especially in women. The results for strength endurance in 
our study confirmed this hypothesis, since the better responses were 
found in women. Notwithstanding, the absence of objective measures 
for neural and hypertrophic components does not allow for a more 
consistent analysis of the potential mechanisms involved in the diffe­
rences observed between the sexes.
Given that the percentage of fast twitch fibers is proportionally 
higher in men and that the hypertrophy process contributes more 
emphatically to muscular strength gains in longer training periods, 
26 greater muscular strength gains would be expected from men 
according to the second stage of our experiment. This hypothesis 
was confirmed only for the squat exercise. On the other hand, in both 
stages of this study, women demonstrated greater gains in maximum 
strength and strength endurance in exercises for the trunk and upper 
limbs. A possible explanation for these results may be that the muscular 
strength recorded for the women was lower than that for the men at 
the beginning of the study in the 1-RM tests for the bench press (39%) 
and arm curl (54%). It is already well established in the literature that 
initial strength levels might influence adaptations induced by RT.22 It 
is noteworthy that the higher concentrations of intramuscular creatine 
that are generally found in women27 may favor improved physical per­
formance by increasing the rate of strength generation and reducing 
the fatigue index and recovery time for intermittent efforts, due to 
the increase in the ATP synthesis rate.28 This hypothesis is supported 
in this study by the greater gains in muscular strength and strength 
endurance found in women.
Several points of this study deserve attention. The protocol we 
adopted allowed us to examine men and women under similar training 
conditions. Moreover, the load adjustments were continuous and based 
on the participants’ individual progress over the course of the RT sessions, 
which allowed us to maintain the intensity throughout the intervention. 
In addition, participants were individually supervised, which enabled 
standardized execution as well as verbal encouragement (external 
motivation), factors that differentiate responses from supervised and 
unsupervised training.29 We also note that restructuring training after 
eight weeks, with changes in the order of execution and an increased 
number of exercises, enabled new adaptive responses, thereby reducing 
the possibility of the plateau effect, which is quite typical of training pro­
tocols that do not adopt progression models.19 Finally, the performance 
measure in 1-RM tests involved a familiarization process prior to the tests 
in an attempt to ensure the technical quality of their execution and the 
reliability of the records in each exercise.18
Conversely, important limitations of this study should not be over­
looked. Although the participants were instructed to maintain their 
eating habits and habitual physical activity level, these variables were 
not controlled over the course of the study. The lack of systematic 
control of these variables may at least partially compromise the adap­
tive responses caused by RT, as these factors may influence different 
components of body composition, especially fat mass and fat-free 
mass, as well as metabolism, thus affecting the magnitude of muscular 
strength and endurance gains. Moreover, women’s menstrual cycles, 
a potential confounding factor, were not controlled. Additionally, 
we did not obtain any metabolic, physiological, or psychobiological 
information along with the motor performance measures, making it 
impossible to analyze the potential mechanisms involved with the 
responses found. Finally, our findings should not be applied to other 
intervention duration periods or to other populations, including par­
ticipants of different age groups and initial fitness levels, as various 
responses to RT may be influenced by such factors.12,30
This study’s main practical application is that RT should be re­
commended to improve muscular strength and strength endurance, 
especially for women. Despite having lower rates of muscular strength 
and strength endurance than men, women appear to be just as or even 
more responsive to this type of training than men, considering similar

age and physical fitness levels. It is noteworthy that muscular strength 
and strength endurance are closely related to daily living activities and 
tend to directly or indirectly influence the level of habitual physical 
activity and quality of life (autonomy and self-esteem).
CONCLUSION
Our results suggest that 16 weeks of RT may improve strength 
endurance in both men and women who have not practiced RT for at 
least six months, although women obtain greater gains. Furthermore, 
increased strength endurance appears to correlate with improved ma­
ximum strength.
