Summary
1. Warming global temperatures are driving changes in species distributions, growth and tim-
ing, but much uncertainty remains regarding how climate change will alter species interac-
tions.
2. Consumer–Resource interactions in particular can be strongly impacted by changes to the
relative performance of interacting species. While consumers generally gain an advantage over
their resources with increasing temperatures, nonlinearities can change this relation near tem-
perature extremes.
3. We use an experimental approach to determine how temperature changes between 5 and
30 °C will alter the growth of the algae Scenedesmus obliquus and the functional responses of
the small-bodied Daphnia ambigua and the larger Daphnia pulicaria.
4. The impact of warming generally followed expectations, making both Daphnia species
more effective grazers, with the increase in feeding rates outpacing the increases in algal
growth rate. At the extremes of our temperature range, however, warming resulted in a
decrease in Daphnia grazing effectiveness. Between 25 and 30 °C, both species of Daphnia
experienced a precipitous drop in feeding rates, while algal growth rates remained high,
increasing the likelihood of algal blooms in warming summer temperatures.
5. Daphnia pulicaria performed signiﬁcantly better at cold temperatures than D. ambigua, but
by 20 °C, there was no signiﬁcant difference between the two species, and at 25 °C, D. am-
bigua outperformed D. pulicaria. Warming summer temperatures will favour the smaller
D. ambigua, but only over a narrow temperature range, and warming beyond 25 °C could
open D. ambigua to invasion from tropical species.
6. By ﬁtting our results to temperature-dependent functions, we develop a temperature- and
density-dependent model, which produces a metric of grazing effectiveness, quantifying the
grazer density necessary to halt algal growth. This approach should prove useful for tracking
the transient dynamics of other density-dependent consumer–resource interactions, such as
agricultural pests and biological-control agents.

Introduction
Warming temperatures brought on by global climate
change have well-documented impacts on species distribu-
tions and phenology (Parmesan 2006). The impacts of
warming on species interactions, however, are more difﬁ-
cult to predict, with warming altering the outcome of
competition and changing the ﬂow of energy through food
webs (Tylianakis et al. 2008; Gilman et al. 2010; O’Con-
nor et al. 2012). Species interactions can both counter and
exacerbate the direct effects of climate change (Suttle,
Thomsen & Power 2007; Post & Pedersen 2008; Harley
2011). Instances where species interactions exacerbate the
direct effects of climate change are of particular concern,
especially in the outbreak of pests and parasites (Harvell
et al. 2002). Consumer–resource interactions, which are of
importance to ecosystem function and stability (McCann,
Hastings & Huxel 1998), may be especially vulnerable to
shifts in temperature because they are strongly impacted
by changes in thermal means and extremes (Petchey et al.
1999; Hoekman 2010; Gilbert et al. 2014).

Consumers generally beneﬁt from warming more than
their prey (Rose & Caron 2007). In the absence of con-
sumers, growth rates of organisms typically increase with
temperature due to the speeding of biological processes
(Fig. 1, arrow 1) (Savage et al. 2004). If resources are
allowed to grow to high densities, however, this effect may
reverse, because the maximum density that populations can
attain (the carrying capacity) has been hypothesized to
decrease with temperature due to increases in metabolic
costs (Fig. 1, arrow 2) (Allen, Brown & Gillooly 2002;
Fussmann et al. 2014). Consumers gain an advantage at
warmer temperatures because of the combined effects of an
increase in attack rates (Fig. 1, arrow 3) and an increase in
the maximum feeding rate (Fig. 1, arrow 4). The increase in
attack rates is the result of an increase in activity rates of
the consumer and/or the resource, while the increase in
maximum feeding rate is due to the speeding of digestion
rates with a rise in temperature (Dell, Pawar & Savage
2014).
The relationship between temperature and the biologi-
cal rates of consumers and resources has been established
within the so-called ‘biologically relevant’ temperature
range, which corresponds to temperatures in which organ-
isms achieve positive growth, but before rates begin to
decline at high temperatures (Savage et al. 2004). Differ-
ences in thermal optima have the potential to drive large
changes
to
our
general
predictions
at
temperature
extremes (Sentis, Hemptinne & Brodeur 2012; Dell, Pawar
&
Savage
2014).
The
performance
of
organisms
at
extreme temperatures will become increasingly important
as global climate change extends the range of tempera-
tures that organisms are exposed to (IPCC 2013). When
temperatures exceed the thermal maxima for consumers,
prey with a greater thermal maximum will outperform
their
predators,
allowing
prey
to
escape
predation,
potentially becoming a nuisance species (Porter, Parry &
Carter 1991).
The direct effects of temperature on growth and feeding
can lead to complex outcomes of consumer–resource
interactions because growth and feeding are nonlinear,
density-dependent processes (Wilmers & Post 2006). The
growth of small, fast-growing primary producers and the
functional responses of herbivores feeding upon them can
be characterized by saturating functions (Fig. 1). Temper-
ature-driven shifts to initial rates of increase or saturating
densities will alter consumer–resource interactions differ-
ently depending on the relative size of the responses and
the density of the resource. For example, increases in con-
sumer attack rates with temperature (Fig. 1, arrow 3) will
have the most impact on the resource at low densities and
will be especially important if they are of a different mag-
nitude than the increase in initial resource growth rates
(Fig. 1, arrow 1).
Recent work on consumer–resource interactions has
improved our understanding of how the vital rates and
feeding patterns scale with temperature (Fig. 1), allowing
researchers to parameterize dynamic models to analyse
the stability and dynamics of consumer–resource interac-
tions (Fussmann et al. 2014; Gilbert et al. 2014). While
the generality of this work is appealing, to understand the
dynamics of individual interactions, it is necessary to mea-
sure the vital rates for the interacting species of interest.
Additionally, the dynamic nature of seasonal temperature
change in temperate systems presents a shifting landscape,
limiting the ability of the system to reach an equilibrium
and making transient population dynamics important
(Hastings 2004). Here, we study the dynamics of speciﬁc
consumer–resource pairs across a temperature gradient,
capturing how relative changes in the vital rates of the
two species will change the nature of their interaction.
Rather than examining the long-term stability of an equi-
librium, which may or may not be reached, we focus on
the conditions that result in zero net population growth
(ZNPG) of the resource, which is a turning point in the
transient dynamic.
We use temperate lake plankton to study how changes
in temperature and prey density alter the interaction
strength of this consumer–resource interaction. Organisms
in temperate lakes naturally experience a wide range of
temperatures,
ranging
from
winter
temperatures
near
freezing to 30 °C in summer. Climate change is unlikely
to affect the low end of the temperature extremes in most
temperate lakes, as they will still reach temperatures at or
near freezing even with substantial warming in winter
months.
Warming
is
impacting
temperate
lakes
by
advancing the timing of key spring events such as the
onset of stratiﬁcation and start of the growing season
(when water temperature reaches ~5 °C), as well as
increasing
the
maximum
temperatures
experienced
in
lakes in summer (Shatwell, Kohler & Nicklisch 2008).
The coupling of phytoplankton and zooplankton graz-
ers is particularly important to lake food webs. Grazer

and consumption rate (dashed) will change with temperature
(cold – blue, warm – red). With an increase in temperature, we
expect (1) an increase in the resource intrinsic growth rate, (2) a
decrease in resource carrying capacity, (3) an increase in the con-
sumer attack rate and (4) an increase in maximum consumption
rate.

control of production is common in lakes, especially dur-
ing the spring when the populations of both phytoplank-
ton and their crustacean zooplankton grazers are growing
rapidly (Sommer et al. 2012). Daphnia sp. are particularly
effective herbivorous crustaceans, which often play a
dominant role in the grazer community (Shapiro &
Wright 1984), making them an important link between
phytoplankton and ﬁsh in aquatic food webs (Mittelbach
et al. 1995). Changes to the strength of the interaction
between Daphnia and the phytoplankton resource have
the potential to alter the timing and magnitude of the
spring bloom and the biomass of Daphnia available to
move up the food web through the growing season (Win-
der & Schindler 2004; Kratina et al. 2012).
In this study, we measure the growth rates of the fresh-
water green algae Scenedesmus obliquus across the range
of temperatures found in temperate lakes and characterize
the functional response of two Daphnia species feeding
upon the algae across the same temperature range. Both
daphnids are widely distributed in north temperate lakes
and can be a dominant force in the spring grazer commu-
nity, but they differ in body size and evolutionary history.
Daphnia pulicaria is a larger cold-adapted species, while
Daphnia ambigua is smaller, widespread, and thought to
be of subtropical origin (Hebert, Witt & Adamowicz
2003). Our study design allows us to measure the impact
of temperature upon algal growth and the functional
response.
By
combining
algal
growth
rates
and
the
consumption of algae by Daphnia, we obtain a metric of
grazing effectiveness, which shows how this consumer–re-
source interaction changes with temperature.
Materials and methods
algal growth rate
We measured the growth rate of the algae S. obliquus at ﬁve-
degree intervals from 5 to 30 °C. Algae were cultured at their
destined temperature regime for 3 days prior to the experiment.
A starting density of <05 mg L1 was added to 150 mL of
COMBO growth media (Kilham et al. 1998) in 250-mL Erlen-
meyer ﬂasks. All cultures were maintained in triplicate and were
grown in front of a Philips F15/T8 Plant and Aquarium ﬂuores-
cent light in an otherwise dark incubator. Cultures were vigor-
ously swirled daily and density was quantiﬁed using a laser
particle counter (Spectrex PC-2200, Redwood City, CA, USA).
We initially quantiﬁed algal densities daily, but reduced the fre-
quency to twice weekly as growth rates slowed.
We converted cell counts to biomass by estimating the dry
mass of three samples from a healthy culture maintained at
20 °C. For each sample, we simultaneously counted cells with the
particle counter and ﬁltered the sample onto pre-weighed glass
ﬁbre ﬁlters. These ﬁlters were dried at 60 °C for 24 h and
reweighed.
This
resulted
in
a
dry
mass
of
1 mg L1
per
216 9 104 (007 9 104) counts mL1 of S. obliquus. The parti-
cle counter showed that the size of S. obliquus was variable
through time; however, this variability was primarily driven by
algal density, not temperature. Counter to the pattern found in
the ‘temperature-size rule’ (Forster, Hirst & Atkinson 2012) for
the last two dates at each temperature, when the algae were close
to carrying capacity, the estimated spherical diameter (ESD) mea-
sured by the particle counter was largest at the warmest tempera-
ture. As found in previous experiments, much of the variation in
S. obliquus ESD is probably due to changes in the length: width
ratio (Margalef 1954). All results are given as dry mass.
To estimate the algal growth rate at each temperature, we cal-
culated the exponential growth rate before density dependence
slowed the growth rate. To do this, we inspected the log-trans-
formed plot of time and density, and identiﬁed the density at
which the curve began to plateau as 95 mg L1. For each tem-
perature, data from day one until the day at which a culture
reached this density were pooled across replicates and the slope
of the log-transformed biomass density vs. time was determined
using linear regression.
We ﬁt a function to the full time series of S. obliquus to quan-
tify the growth rate at different algal densities. The commonly
used
logistic
growth
curve
did
not
ﬁt
the
time
series
of
S. obliquus growth well because the logistic features a linear
decline in the mass-speciﬁc growth rate, while the density depen-
dence of S. obliquus was strongly nonlinear with a concave shape,
which results in a very poor ﬁt to the logistic function (Smith
1963). Following the approach of Paine et al. (2012), we tested
the suite of saturating models recommended in their study as well
as the theta-logistic model to match the form of density depen-
dence found in the data. Logistic models proved to be the best ﬁt
to our data set (Table S1, Supporting information). The pattern
of density dependence we observed, which was strongly nonlin-
ear, was best ﬁt by the theta-logistic model:
dN
dt ¼ rN 1 
N
K
 h

#
eqn 1
where K is the saturating density, r is the initial instantaneous
growth rate and h is a constant, which alters the form of density
dependence. When h is equal to 1, the equation simpliﬁes to the
familiar logistic equation with a linear relationship between per-
capita growth rate and density. When h is >1, the graph of per-
capita growth rate and density becomes convex, and when it is
<1, it becomes concave. Integrating and simplifying this equa-
tion gives the abundance (Nt) at any time (t) as:
Nt ¼ ½kh þ ðNh

eqn 2
where N0 is the initial density, and e is the exponential function.
To ﬁt the data, we used nonlinear least squares regression, using
the nls function in R (R Development Core Team 2013). The
theta-logistic function is difﬁcult to ﬁt to data because r and h
are highly correlated (Clark et al. 2010). We were able to over-
come this by ﬁxing r to the value from the initial phase of algal
growth, which allowed us to obtain reasonable ﬁts for h and K.
daphnia feeding experiment
We estimated the functional response of Daphnia pulicaria and
Daphnia ambigua feeding upon S. obliquus, again at ﬁve-degree
intervals from 5 to 30 °C. The same approach was used for both
daphnids, although modiﬁcations were necessary for D. ambigua
at low temperatures due to their low feeding rate. For all treat-
ments, Daphnia were raised in their target temperature for their

entire lifetime. Gravid females that had not yet released their ﬁrst
clutch were used in all experiments. If a full clutch was released
during the course of a feeding trial, the replicate was discarded.
If one to three neonates were released, it did not seem to affect
the feeding rate measurements and these replicates were included.
In recognition that intraspeciﬁc variation in the Daphnia
response to temperature exists between clones, we used ﬁve clones
of each species for the experiments. Measuring the different
response of each clone was beyond the scope of this study, so
one individual from each clone went into each replicate of the
feeding experiment to better measure the mean of the species
response to warming. Daphnia were kept at high food density
until the start of the experiment. The ﬁve Daphnia were added to
80 mL of COMBO media into each of seven initial algal densities
between 045 and 175 mg L1. Five replicates of each algal den-
sity were used. Additionally, three algal cultures at each density
were left free of Daphnia as controls. Jars were placed at the
appropriate treatment temperature and left in the dark to mini-
mize algal growth. After 8 h, the S. obliquus were quantiﬁed
using the laser particle counter. The quantity of algae consumed
was calculated by subtracting the algae remaining after 8 h from
the density of the controls.
Daphnia ambigua had very low feeding rates at low tempera-
tures. As a result, we were not able to obtain estimates for 5 °C
and we increased the number of D. ambigua to 15 in each repli-
cate at 10 and 15 °C. As the mass of D. ambigua is approxi-
mately one-third of D. pulicaria (D. pulicaria 674 lg dry mass,
D. ambigua 205 lg dry mass), we do not expect the increase in
Daphnia density to increase density-related foraging interference
beyond that experienced by D. pulicaria. Furthermore, at 10 °C,
we found it necessary to starve the D. ambigua for 24 h prior to
the start of the experiment to observe depletion of algae. Thus,
the 10 °C consumption rates for D. ambigua are an overestimate
of consumption in comparison with the other treatment and pro-
vided only for reference.
fitting the functional response
Saturation in the functional response was apparent at all temper-
atures. To test whether a Holling type II or III curve was most
appropriate, we used logistic regression (Holling 1959; Juliano
2001). For the majority of temperatures for both species, a type
II curve proved to be the best ﬁt, so we present those results
here. The Holling type II curve is a mechanistic model with the
form
Ne ¼
atN
1 þ ahN
eqn 3
where Ne is the number of prey eaten per consumer, a is the
attack rate (1 per mg Daphnia h), t is time, N is the number of
prey available and h is the handling time (mg Daphnia h per mg
algae). To account for prey depletion, we use the Rogers Ran-
dom Predator function (Rogers 1972).
Ne ¼ Nð1  eaðthNeÞÞ
eqn 4
As a mechanistic model, the Holling type II curve allows us to
examine how temperature affects the two parameters of the func-
tional response, attack rate (a) and handing time (h). Using a
maximum likelihood approach resulted in a poor ﬁt, especially at
high algal densities, so the curves were ﬁt with nonlinear least
squares using the lambert w function to solve the Rogers Ran-
dom Predator Equation in R (Bolker 2008).
To compare the functional response across temperatures and
between species, we used pairwise sum of squares reduction and
an F-test. We constrained the model so that the parameters a and
h were the same for both pairs (model 1) and compared this with
the full model with the two factors ﬁt separately (model 2). We
then compared ﬁts with an F-test;
F ¼ ððRSS1  RSS2Þ=ðp2  p1ÞÞ
ðRSS2=ðn  p2ÞÞ
eqn 5
where RSSi are the residual sums of squares for model i, pi are
the number of parameters in model i and n is the number of data
points. Signiﬁcant differences between the full and reduced mod-
els from an F-distribution (with p2–p1, n–p2 degrees of freedom)
show that the functional response is different for the tempera-
tures or species considered. We carried out this comparison for
each temperature pairing within a species (10 comparisons for
D. ambigua, 15 for D. pulicaria) and for each matched tempera-
ture between species (4 comparisons – 10 °C was excluded) using
a Bonferroni-corrected a for multiple comparisons (a = 0005 for
D. ambigua, a = 00033 for D. pulicaria and a = 0013 for the
between-species comparison).
temperature dependence of grazing
effectiveness
By combining the functions for the growth rate of S. obliquus
and the consumption of S. obliquus by Daphnia, we are able to
construct a model for algal growth in the presence of either daph-
nid (Z).

To incorporate temperature into our model, we ﬁt each param-
eter (r, K, h for algal growth, a and h for each Daphnia species)
to a temperature-dependent function. All vital rates for algal
growth and Daphnia consumption were ﬁrst ﬁt at their individual
temperatures as detailed above. We then ﬁt the Arrhenius model
to the results

model has received extensive study in investigating the tempera-
ture dependence of various biological rates (Gillooly et al. 2001;
Englund et al. 2011). While it has been successful in revealing
patterns within the ‘biologically relevant’ temperature range, it
results in poor ﬁts when a thermal optimum is present. In such
cases, a quadratic model may be preferable (Englund et al. 2011):

where c, b (eV) and q (eV2) are ﬁtted parameters, which deter-
mine the shape of the temperature dependence (Englund et al.

2011). In this case, the parameter ‘b’ can no longer be interpreted
as the activation energy.
We used a weighted regression with the values of the parame-
ters from the individual regression ﬁts at each temperature for
algal growth and the functional response as the data, and the
inverse of the standard error of the parameter estimates as
weights. To select between the Arrhenius model and the Arrhe-
nius quadratic model, we compared the Akaike information crite-
ria (AIC) for the regression ﬁts of each parameter to eqns 7 and
8 and chose the model with the lower AIC. We omit the 10 °C
treatment of D. ambigua because the differences in methodology
do not allow for a reasonable comparison to other treatments.
Using the temperature-dependent functions, we determined the
density of Daphnia (Z) necessary to reach ZNPG of S. obliquus
by setting dN/dt in eqn 5 to zero and solving for Z. To facilitate
comparison between the two Daphnia species, we transform the
per-capita consumption to a per-gram basis. The biomass of
Daphnia necessary for ZNPG is a useful measure of grazing effec-
tiveness because it measures the ability of Daphnia to consume
algae relative to the algal growth rate. A higher grazing effective-
ness translates to a lower biomass of Daphnia necessary for
ZNPG of algae. Grazing effectiveness increases with an increase
in feeding rate or a decrease in algal growth rate, but can
decrease even with an increase in feeding rate if algal growth rate
increases more quickly.
By combining our measurements of Daphnia feeding with our
observations on Daphnia survival, metabolic theory and values
from the literature, we were able to construct a model for Daph-
nia growth across temperature (eqn S1). Combining the model
for algal growth with the model for Daphnia growth enables us
to simulate the transient dynamics of the Daphnia–algae system.
Results
At low densities, algal growth rates increased with an
increase in temperature up to 25 °C (ANCOVA P < 0001
for all pairwise contrasts), but there was no signiﬁcant dif-
ference in the intrinsic growth rate between 25 and 30 °C
(ANCOVA,
F1,15 = 0586,
P = 046)
(Fig. 2).
Using
the
theta-logistic growth model, we obtained good ﬁts to the
algal
growth
at
all
temperatures
from
5
to
30 °C
(Table 1). Algal growth did not saturate until exceeding
420 mg L1 at 30 °C, with higher densities at saturation
at cooler temperatures, saturating at over 1000 mg L1 at
5 and 10 °C (Table 1). The quadratic temperature-depen-
dent model was a better ﬁt for the algal growth rate and
density dependence terms (r and h), while the carrying
capacity best ﬁt with the Arrhenius model (Table 2). The
quadratic model indicated that algal growth rate (r)
peaked at 266 °C, while the density dependence term (h)
reached a minimum at 248 °C.
Daphnia feeding rates generally increased up to 25 °C
and decreased signiﬁcantly between 25 and 30 °C for both
D. ambigua and D. pulicaria (Fig. 3). For D. ambigua,
there
was
a
signiﬁcant
difference
in
the
functional
response between every temperature (F-tests, P < 0001)
except between 15 and 30 °C (F2,58 = 1065, P = 035).
For
D. pulicaria,
feeding
rates
increased
signiﬁcantly
between 5 and 10 °C and between 10 and 15 °C (F-tests,
P < 0001), but there was no signiﬁcant difference in the
functional response between 15, 20 and 25 °C (15 and
20 °C: F2,61 = 0726, P = 049, 20 and 25 °C: F2,64 = 083,
P = 044, 15 and 25 °C:
F2,57 = 568, P = 0006). At
30 °C, the functional response for D. pulicaria was signiﬁ-
cantly different
from all other temperatures (F-tests,
P < 0001).
At warmer temperatures, the smaller D. ambigua gained
an advantage in feeding over D. pulicaria. Below 10 °C,
we were unable to record depletion of algae for D. am-
bigua using the same methods as D. pulicaria, indicating

that D. pulicaria outperformed D. ambigua at these tem-
peratures. At 15 °C, D. pulicaria had a signiﬁcantly higher
feeding rate (F2,57 = 215, P < 0001); at 20 °C, there was
no signiﬁcant difference between the functional responses
(F2,65 = 114, P = 033); and at 25 °C, D. ambigua had a
signiﬁcantly higher feeding rate (F2,59 = 936, P < 0001).
After both species lost function at 30 °C, there was again
no signiﬁcant difference between the functional responses
(F2,57 = 187, P = 016).
The increase in feeding rate with temperature was
caused by both an increase in the attack rate and a
decrease in the handling time (Fig. 4). The Arrhenius
quadratic temperature-dependent model was a best ﬁt for
both attack rate and handling time for D. pulicaria and
for attack rate for D. ambigua. Although the AIC slightly
prefers the Arrhenius model for handling time of D. am-
bigua (Table S2), neither model was a good ﬁt. We have
elected to use the Arrhenius quadratic model for this
parameter as well, based on the consensus from the other
functional response parameters. The quadratic model
showed that for D. pulicaria, attack rate reached a maxi-
mum at 210 °C and handling time reached a minimum at
206 °C. For D. ambigua, the temperature dependence
was shifted to warmer temperatures, 228 °C for attack
rate and 239 °C for handling time.
We combined our results for the effects of temperature
on algal growth and Daphnia grazing to produce a
response surface showing how the density of Daphnia nec-
essary to produce ZNPG of algae changes with algal den-
sity and temperature (Fig. 5). Grazing effectiveness of
D. pulicaria was maximized at 19 °C, while grazing effec-
tiveness of D. ambigua did not peak until 23 °C.
Discussion
Our experiments revealed that a warming of 5 °C could
increase, decrease or have little effect on the consumer–re-
source interaction depending on the starting temperature,
the resource density and the species identity. We expected
to see an increase in grazing effectiveness with warming
as the attack rate increased and handling time decreased
more rapidly than algal growth increased. Between 5 and
25 °C, Scenedesmus obliquus growth, as well as Daphnia
ambigua and D. pulicaria feeding, generally followed this
pattern. Within this temperature range, algal growth rates
and Daphnia feeding rates increased with temperature
(Figs 2 and 3). Increases in temperature had a stronger
effect on Daphnia feeding rates than algal growth between
10 and 25 °C, as indicated by a lower density of Daphnia
necessary to balance algal growth (Fig. 5).
Above 25 °C, however, we saw departures from our
expectations. A dramatic decrease in Daphnia grazing
effectiveness between 25 and 30 °C (Fig. 5) highlights one
of the most troubling impacts of climate change on spe-
cies interactions (Porter, Parry & Carter 1991). As tem-
perature increased from 25 to 30 °C, algal growth rates
remained high (Fig. 2); however, Daphnia grazing rates
began to fall. For both species of Daphnia, this reduction
in performance was largely due to an increase in handling
time (Fig. 4), indicating that Daphnia may be entering an

anaerobic condition at 30 °C (Portner & Farrell 2008).
For the consumer–resource pair of Daphnia and Scenedes-
mus, pushing the system to these warmest temperatures
would enable algae to escape control by grazers, allowing
them to reach high densities associated with nuisance
algal blooms (Carpenter et al. 1995).
Changes in algal density have an impact on grazing
effectiveness that is similar in magnitude to changes in
temperature (Fig. 5). Although the per-capita growth of
algae slows with increases in algal density, the population
growth rate of the algae increases with density up to ~1/3
of carrying capacity (Fig. S2) so the population growth
rate increases across all densities we consider in Fig. 5. As
algal density increases, the overall consumption rate of
Daphnia increases; however, the saturating nature of the
type II functional response slows this affect, and results in
the per-algal mortality rate decreasing with increasing
algal density. As a result, the ability of Daphnia to control
the algal resource in spring is greatly aided by tempera-
tures warming rapidly so that consumption rates increase
while algal populations remain low (D. C. West and D.
M. Post, in preparation).
Our results suggest that caution is needed in applying
temperature-dependent models near temperature extremes
where the models may not ﬁt the performance of speciﬁc
species well. While the ﬁts of the functional response
parameters to the quadratic temperature-dependent model
were generally good (Fig. 4, Table 2), at the coldest tem-
perature analysed for each daphnid, the temperature-
dependent model estimates much higher handling times
than the functional response model ﬁt to the raw data
(Fig. 4b). The temperature-dependent model ﬁts are not
unreasonable, as they pass within the observed data
points (Fig. S4) and the standard errors for the handling
time ﬁts at these cold temperatures were the highest of
any of the temperatures considered. Nonetheless, the large
increase in handling time for D. pulicaria at 5 °C changes
the conclusions of our investigation of grazing effective-
ness both quantitatively and qualitatively. Analysing the
independently ﬁt functional responses, we ﬁnd that the
increase in feeding rate between 5 and 10 °C was not

rapid enough to outpace the increase in algal growth rate
at high algal densities (Fig. S5), causing D. pulicaria graz-
ing effectiveness to decline. The cause for the poor ﬁt of
handling time at cold temperatures in this study is not
clear. Selecting a different functional shape for tempera-
ture dependence could decrease the discrepancies, but
near temperature extremes, organismal adaptations or
changes in behaviour (Heinrich 1974; Jayatilaka et al.
2011) could result in systematic biases in temperature-
dependent models.
The Daphnia biomass necessary to reach ZNPG of
algae provides a useful measure of grazing effectiveness,
but is also an important metric in itself. When this value
is reached in spring in temperate lakes, it marks the maxi-
mum extent of the spring bloom, after which the algal
population declines and the Daphnia population crashes.
The speciﬁc values that we produce in this study are unli-
kely to be widely generalizable, as differences in nutrient
content and light intensity will alter algal growth rates.
Additionally, as the temperature dependence is nonlinear
and there are spatial and temporal variations in water
temperature, this can become a difﬁcult calculation in
complex systems. Nonetheless, in stable lake environ-
ments, managers concerned with limiting algal growth to
prescribed limits may be able to estimate algal growth
in situ and use this with the feeding parameters developed
here to estimate grazer densities necessary to halt algal
growth in their systems. Similarly, this approach should
be useful for managing pest populations, allowing man-
agers of greenhouses or agricultural ﬁelds to determine
the density of predators necessary for biological control
of pest outbreaks.
In summer, climate change is pushing maximum tem-
peratures beyond where they reached historically (IPCC,
2013). As water warms beyond 25 °C, it will cause D. am-
bigua and D. pulicaria to lose grazing function, while
S. obliquus is unaffected, allowing algae to proliferate.
This could have a myriad of impacts upon freshwater or
marine plankton ecosystems experiencing similar changes
in
species
interactions.
One
troubling
ecosystem-level
change is the impact of algal blooms on oxygen dynamics.
Although algae produce oxygen when photosynthesizing,
they are net consumers of oxygen at night and when
decomposing (Hallegraeff 1993). Increases in temperature
exacerbate the oxygen use of both living and decomposing
algal cells, resulting in greater drawdowns of oxygen at
higher temperatures (Jewell & McCarty 1971; Lopez-
Urrutia et al. 2006). The combined effects of an increase
in summer algal biomass along with faster metabolism
and decomposition from increased temperatures could
lead to dramatic oxygen ﬂuctuations.
The fall in algal carrying capacity (K) with temperature
followed
the
expectation
that
the
saturating
density
should decrease with temperature due to greater metabolic
demands at high temperatures (Figs 1 and 2b). K was the
only parameter we analysed that followed the Arrhenius
model, showing a consistent impact of temperature, rather
than a hump-shaped relationship. The activation energy
of
031 eV
is
slightly
higher
than
the
average
of
071 eV found by Fussmann et al. (2014). Although
their analysis consisted of only six studies, of which ﬁve
were bacterial studies, this indicates that the carrying
capacity of S. obliquus may be less affected by tempera-
ture change than other organisms.
Within the ‘biologically relevant’ temperature range,
our results are generally consistent with the general ﬁnd-
ing from bioenergetics studies of growth rates (r) (Savage
et al. 2004), carrying capacity (K) (Allen, Brown & Gil-
looly 2002), attack rate (a) (Dell, Pawar & Savage 2014)
and handling time (h) (Fussmann et al. 2014). However,
as the organisms we are studying regularly experience
temperatures ranging from 5 to 30 °C, we extended our
temperature-dependent model to this range, requiring a
quadratic model to ﬁt the data for all parameters except
carrying capacity. By connecting the resource growth rate
to the consumption rate, we are able to characterize the
temperature and density dependence of the consumer–re-
source interaction in terms that are important to the pop-
ulation dynamics. Our results show that both differences
in the strength of the response to temperature and differ-
ences
in
thermal
optima
are
important
for
the
S. obliquus–Daphnia interaction (Dell, Pawar & Savage
2014). Fussmann et al. (2014) identiﬁed 26 studies that
measured the functional response of a consumer or para-
site across multiple temperatures. Of these only Durbin &
Durbin (1992) measure the growth rate of the resource
and, in that case, it was only measured as a part of their
methodology
for
measuring
the
functional
response.
Many of the studies note a drop in performance of con-
sumers at high temperatures, but it is not clear how this
inﬂuences the consumer–resource interaction if perfor-
mance of the resource is not known.
Differences in thermal tolerances between grazer species
will play an important role in determining the impact of
warming on consumer–resource interactions and affect
their ability to coexist in natural systems. In this study,
D. pulicaria far outperforms D. ambigua at cold tempera-
tures, while D. ambigua becomes a more effective con-
sumer
as
temperatures
warm
beyond
20 °C.
While
seasonal variation in temperature may increase the ability
of these grazers to coexist, warming that pushes temperate
lakes out of cool winter temperatures more quickly and
drives summer temperatures into the 25 °C range should
favour D. ambigua over D. pulicaria. Interestingly, in
southern North America, D. ambigua is facing competi-
tion from the invasive D. lumholtzi, which has been
shown to tolerate temperatures in the 27–30 °C range
where D. ambigua begins to lose function (Work &
Gophen
1999).
In
Florida,
USA,
D. ambigua
has
remained the dominant daphnid in all but one of a set 15
lakes, which were recently surveyed (Havens et al. 2012),
although D. lumholtzi has established populations in 10 of
these systems. This area is part of what is known as the
‘warming hole’, which has experienced a slight cooling

over the past 50 years (Meehl, Arblaster & Branstator
2012), leaving open the possibility that D. lumholtzi will
replace D. ambigua if the Southeastern USA begins to
warm in coming years (Engel, Tollrian & Jeschke 2012).
Explicitly linking the growth rate of a resource with the
functional response of a consumer feeding upon that
resource across a range of temperatures is a powerful
approach for studying the impact of temperature on con-
sumer–resource
dynamics.
Detailed
laboratory
experi-
ments such as this clearly cannot be performed for all
consumer–resources pairs that will be impacted by global
climate change; however, it would be valuable to conduct
similar studies on strongly interacting species in other sys-
tems – in particular agricultural pests and their biological-
control
agents.
Pairing
the
functional
response
with
resource growth rates will allow further modelling work
to anticipate the impacts of climate change as well as pin-
point the conditions when the resource is primed for
growth or vulnerable to depletion.
Our study reinforces the notion that the impact of cli-
mate change upon species interactions will be complex
(Angert, LaDeau & Ostfeld 2013), requiring careful study
if we want to be able to predict the impact of warming on
ecosystem dynamics. By extending our study to tempera-
tures that are experienced by organisms but seldom stud-
ied in the laboratory, we revealed important alterations to
the strength of interaction between algae and a keystone
grazer in temperate lakes. Rather than focusing on equi-
librium
dynamics,
which
may
not
be
reached,
our
approach of relating temperature- and density-dependent
growth and consumption rates allows us to examine the
transient dynamics, which are critical to the outbreaks of
fast-growing populations. While caution must be used
when applying temperature-dependent models near tem-
perature extremes, there is tremendous potential for these
models to both improve our understanding and increase
our predictive power for consumer–resource interactions.
