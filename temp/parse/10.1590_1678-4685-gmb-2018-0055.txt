Abstract
The ants of the genus Atta are considered important pests to agriculture in the Americas, although Atta species are
also important contributors to ecosystem functions in the various habitats in which they occur. The aim of this study
was to assemble four complete mitochondrial genomes of the genus Atta, construct the phylogenomic tree, and ana-
lyze the gene content, order, and organization. The mitogenomes of A. colombica, A. opaciceps, A. texana, and A.
sexdens rubropilosa comprise 18,392, 19,257, 19,709, and 19,748 bp, respectively. The four Atta mitogenomes
showed the charactistics typical of those of insects, with 13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNAs, and 2 rRNAs, with
genes displayed in the conventional order. Analysis for intergenic spacer regions showed that Atta intergenic spac-
ers are larger than those of the outgroups. Phylogenomic analyses using partial cytochrome oxidase I gene se-
quences showed similar topologies to previous phylogenetic analyses, with high clade support values. We conclude
that Atta mitogenomes are characterized by high conservation in gene order and have giant intergenic spacers in the
genus Atta.

The ants of the genus Atta are leafcutters belonging to
the tribe Attini (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Myrmicinae)
and are considered important pests to agriculture in the
Americas, although Atta species are also important contri-
butors to ecosystem functions in the various habitats in
which they occur. The species widespread in Brazil are A.

Phylogenetic analyses using gene fragments of cyto-
chrome oxidase I, tRNA leucine, and cytochrome oxidase
II revealed four clades: (1) A. texana, A. mexicana, and A.
insularis in the Archeatta clade; (2) A. colombica and A.
cephalotes in the Atta s. str. clade; (3) A. opaciceps, A.
laevigata, A. capiguara, A. bisphaerica, A. vollenweideri
Forel 1939 and A. saltensis in the Epiatta clade, and (4) A.
sexdens and A. robusta in the Neoatta clade (Bacci et al.,
2009). These phylogenetic relationships showed some cla-
des with low branch support, and the phylogenetic analysis
using complete mitogenomes provided robust inferences.
Complete mitogenomes allow the analysis of rearrange-
ments, deletions, duplications, and inversions among mito-
genomes. However, complete mitogenomes for the genus
Atta have been described only for A. laevigata (Rodovalho
et al., 2014) and A. cephalotes (Suen et al., 2011). For other
species of the subfamily Myrmicinae, mitogenomes are
available for Pristomyrmex punctatus (Hasegawa et al.,
2011), three species of Solenopsis (Gotzek et al., 2010),
Vollenhovia emeryi (Liu et al., 2016), Wasmannia auro-
punctata (Duan et al., 2016), and Myrmica scabrinodis
(Babbuci et al., 2014).
In this study, four complete mitochondrial genomes
of the genus Atta were assembled. Mitogenomes were uti-
lized for phylogenomic analyses, gene content, and order
for exploring the evolution of the genus Atta. For develop-
ment of mitogenomes, reads of A. opaciceps were sequen-
ced, and reads of A. colombica, A. texana, and A. sexdens
rubropilosa were downloaded from the NCBI database and
utilized to assemble the complete mitogenomes.

Genomics and Bioinformatics
For A. opaciceps, the biological sample was collected
in the state of Alagoas, Brazil, and DNA extraction was
performed using the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide
(CTAB) extraction method (Doyle and Doyle, 1987). The
quality and quantity of the extracted DNA were verified by
visualization on a 1% agarose gel and spectrophotometryer,
respectively. The DNA sample was fragmented by soni-
cation into 500–600 bp to construct the sequencing library,
and fragments were ligated with adapters using the Nextera
DNA Sample Preparation” (Illumina) kit. Sequencing of
paired-end fragments with a size of 100 nt was done on a
Illumina HiSeq2500 platform at the Central Laboratory for
High Performance Technologies in Life Sciences (LacTad)
at the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP) in Cam-
pinas, São Paulo.
For A. colombica (SRR3187022 and SRR3168931),
A. texana (SRR5438011), and A. sexdens rubropilosa
(SRR5651498), short reads were obtained from public data
in NCBI, from which the SRA files were unpacked into
FASTQ using the FASTQ-DUMP tool executable from the
SRA Toolkit. FASTQ files were then filtered with a mini-
mum quality of 10, converted into FASTA files, and uti-
lized for genome assembly. Thirty million reads of A.
colombica, 24 million reads of A. opaciceps, 3.3 million
reads of A. texana, and 4.2 million reads for A sexdens
rubropilosa were used.
To obtain the mitochondrial genome of the four spe-
cies, reads were mapped using the mitochondrial genome
of A. laevigata as reference, using the software Geneious
R9 (http://www.geneious.com). The draft mitogenomes
were checked using contigs from the de novo assembling
generated by Ray software (Boisvert et al., 2012), per-
formed using parameter kmer 31; the largest contig was an-
alyzed using BLAST for mitochondrial identification.
Genome annotation was achieved using the MITOS web
server (Bernt et al., 2013) and confirmed with Geneious
software using the mitochondrial genome of A. laevigata as
reference. The annotations were checked and, where neces-
sary, manually corrected. A graphic representation of the
mitochondrial genome of A. opaciceps was created using
Geneious.
Six mitochondrial genomes for the genus Atta and
other three genomes from the Myrmicinae subfamily were
utilized for phylogenetic inferences (Table 1). The mito-
genomes for A. cephalotes, A. laevigata, M. scabrinodis, P.
punctatus, and S. richteri were obtained from the NCBI and
the mitogenomes of the A. colombica, A. opaciceps, A.
texana, and A sexdens rubropilosa were assembled in this
study. The mitogenome sequences were aligned using the
program MAFFT v7.017 (Katoh and Standley, 2013) im-
plemented as the “Multiple align” tool in Geneious R9, the
evolutionary history was inferred using the maximum like-
lihood (ML) method based on the GTR+I+G nucleotide
substitution model (Nei and Kumar, 2000), and branch sup-
port was assessed with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. The nu-

cleotide substitution model and ML analyses were con-
ducted in MEGA7 (Kumar et al., 2016). The genetic
relationships among species were also investigated through
a principal component analysis (PCA) using the func-
tionglPcain R packageadegenet (Jombart and Ahmed,
2011) and Single sequence repeats (SSRs); microsatellites
were identified using Phobos software (Mayer, 2010).
The mitogenomes of A. colombica, A. opaciceps, A.
texana, and A. sexdens rubropilosa contained 18,392,
19,257, 19,709, and 19,748 bp, respectively (Table 1). Af-
ter obtaining the final mitogenomes, mapping with short
reads was carried out, allowing to map the reads with no er-
rors and 100% identity, which resulted in an average cover-
age of 139.2 x for A. opaciceps, 62.2 x for A. colombica,
304 x for A. texana, and 35.4 x for A. sexdens rubropilosa
(Figure S1).
The four Atta mitogenomes showed the typical char-
acteristics of those for insects, with 13 protein-coding ge-
nes, 22 tRNAs, and 2 rRNAs, as well as the noncoding re-
gion (Figure 1 and Table 1), with the genes displayed in the
same order and orientation as in the hypothesized ancestral
mitogenome (Figure S2). The mitogenome arrangement for
the genus Atta was identical, wherein the protein-coding
genes and the rRNAs displayed the same order and orienta-
tion. Additional tRNAs were observed between ATP8 and
COX2 in A. cephalotes (Figure S2).
The A + T contents of mitogenomes were high, rang-
ing from 72.7% (A. sexdens rubropilosa) to 82.5% (A.

texana). For the coding region, the lowest A + T content
was in COXI, COX3, and ATP6, whereas the highest A + T
content was between ND5 and ND3. The A + T contents
between the coding and noncoding regions were different,
ranging from 77.6% (A. cephalotes) to 78.5% (A. texana),
whereas the noncoding regions showed an A + T content
ranging from 84.1% (A. sexdens rubropilosa) to 90.3% (A.
texana). The four genomes of the genus Atta revealed 60
SSRs, which were evenly distributed, and the di-nucleotide
motifs were more abundant, except for A. cephalotes for
which the tetra-nucleotide motifs were more abundant (Fi-
gure S3).
The size of the whole non-coding (intergenic spacers)
regions showed that Atta species have large intergenic
spacers when compared with the outgroup (Figure 2A),
ranging from 3,655 to 5,238 bp, whereas the outgroup
showed spacers ranging from 738 to 1,550 bp (Table 1).
The large intergenic spacers in the genus Atta are found in
all intergenic spacers (Figure 2B). For the coding region,
the sequences displayed similar length in the Atta and the
outgroup (Table 1).
The phylogenetic analysis showed A. texana as the
basal clade and the other species as the derived clade (Fig-
ure 3). The topologies obtained with the complete mito-
genome (Figure 3A) and coding regions (Figure 3B)
showed no difference. In both phylogenetic analyses, the
branch-support values were high, with a bootstrap value of
>96% for the Atta clades. The results of PCA for complete
mitogenomes and the coding regions were different. PCA
using complete genomes showed clear support for species
delimitation in Atta (Figure S4A). When using only coding
regions, A. colombica and A. cephalotes species formed
one group and A. laevigata and A. opaciceps formed an-
other (Figure S4B). In the PCA for complete mitogenomes,
the first principal component separated A. laevigata, A.
opaciceps, and A. sexdens rubropilosa from the other spe-
cies, and the second principal component separated A.
colombica and A. cephalotes from A. texana.

the supported values were estimated by bootstrap.
The nucleotide compositions in all analyzed Atta
mitogenomes are characterized by a high frequency of A +
T. The same result was reported previously for A. laevigata
by Rodovalho et al. (2014), and the gene order and orienta-
tion are the same in all Atta mitogenomes, like in the ances-
tral insect mitochondrial genome (Cameron et al., 2014).
However, Atta mitogenomes were larger, suggesting a phy-
logenetic signal. The size variation is influenced by expan-
sions in intergenic spaces, confirmed by the larger inter-
genic spacers found in Atta mitogenomes. Expansions in
the intergenic spaces do not affect gene functions, and thus
can be considered selectively neutral. Intergenic spaces
from other insect mitogenomes have been reported to range
from 216 bp in Naupactus xanthographus (Song et al.,
2010) to 5,654 bp in Protaetia brevitarsis (Kim et al.,
2014), suggesting that Atta mitogenomes are characterized
by larger intergenic spacers.
Mitogenomes have an impact on insect genetics, as
they are widely utilized for phylogenetic studies. Regard-
ing the genus Atta, Bacci et al. (2009) utilized partial mito-
chondrial gene sequences (COI, tRNA leucine, and COII)
for phylogenetic analysis. However, the advent of next-
generation sequencing technologies has resulted in the
complete sequencing of mitogenomes, allowing robust
phylogenetic analyses. This approach allows a phylogen-
etic reconstruction using complete mitogenomes and cod-
ing or noncoding regions (intergenic spaces). In the present
study, two phylogenetic analyses were conducted, using
the complete genomes and only the coding regions. The re-
sult showed that phylogenetic analysis using the complete
mitogenomes was more informative in both ML and PCA
analyses than that using the coding regions only, as the rate
of substitution in the complete mitogenome was larger than
that in coding regions, and the principal component sepa-
rated the Atta species.
Topologies using complete mitogenomes were simi-
lar to the phylogeny generated with partial COI-tRNA-
COII sequences (Bacci et al., 2009), revealing A. texana in
the basal clade, A. cephalotes and A. colombica in the sec-
ond clade, A. laevigata and A. opaciceps in the third clade,
and A. sexdens rubropilosa in the fourth clade. However,
bootstrap values using mitogenomes were larger than those
for partial COI-tRNA-COII, indicating more robust phylo-
genetic inference with mitogenomes. We conclude that
Atta mitogenomes are characterized by high conservation
in gene order and organization and by giant intergenic spac-
ers.
