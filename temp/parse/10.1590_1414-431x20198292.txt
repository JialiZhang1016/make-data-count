Abstract
The thymus is a primary lymphoid organ responsible for the maturation of Tcells as well as the immunological central tolerance.
It is in the antenatal period and infancy that it plays its major role. In clinical practice, T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs)
are considered a direct and reliable measure of the thymic function. TRECs are a by-product of DNA formation in gene
rearrangement of T cell receptors. They are stable and they do not duplicate during mitosis, representing the recent
emigrant T cells from the thymus. Despite their importance, TRECs have been neglected by physicians and there is a lack
of data regarding thymic function during infancy of healthy children. In order to evaluate thymic function in the ﬁrst years
of life, we propose measuring TRECs as a valuable tool. One hundred and three blood samples from children and
adolescents between 3 months and 20 years of age were analyzed. The mean TRECs count was 136.77±96.7 copies of
TRECs/mL of DNA. The individuals between 0 and 5 years of age had signiﬁcantly higher TRECs values than those
between 10 and 20 years of age. No signiﬁcant difference was observed in TRECs values among age groups below
5 years of age. An inverse correlation between TRECs and age was found (r=0.3 P=0.003). These data highlight and
validate the evidence of decreased thymus function with age, even during infancy. Awareness should be raised with this
important albeit ignored organ.

Introduction
The thymus is a primary lymphoid organ responsible
for the maturation of T cells as well as immunological
central tolerance. Despite its relevance in early immunity,
the thymus has been neglected by physicians (1). Unlike
bone marrow function, which is the counterpart to thymic
function in relation to B cells, thymic function is rarely
evaluated in everyday medical practice. A number of
ignored aggressions to the thymus occur, such as the
use of corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive drugs,
systemic infections, and even hormonal changes (2).
To assess these mentioned aggressions, an effective
way of measuring thymic function is needed. Currently,
thymic function can be indirectly measured by computer-
ized tomography imaging, PET scans, and ﬂow cytometry
for Tcell subpopulations (3). More recently, at the beginning
of this century, a direct measurement method with T cell
receptor excision circles (TRECs) was developed (4).
TRECs are a byproduct of DNA formation during gene
rearrangement of T cell receptors. Because TRECs are
stable and do not duplicate during mitosis, TRECs in the
peripheral blood represent a valid biomarker of recent
thymic function; thus, TREC-positive cells are called recent
thymic emigrants. For a few conditions, evaluations to
measure TRECs are usually conducted in clinical practice
(5): i) newborn screening tests for severe combined
immunodeﬁciency (SCID), ii) evaluation of immune recon-
stitution during antiretroviral therapy in AIDS patients, and
iii) testing T cell reconstitution after bone marrow transplan-
tation. TRECs counts have also been used to evaluate
thymic function in SCID and DiGeorge patients (5). In
addition to these relevant uses, TRECs counts can be
useful for evaluating thymic function, particularly in early
life, which is considered the period when the role of the
thymus is most important (6). To the best of our knowledge,
normal values of TRECs in early age have not been deeply
explored. Some authors have previously studied TRECs in
normal populations; however, these studies included few
individuals in their ﬁrst years of life (6,7).

In the present paper, we proposed to study TRECs
in healthy children and adolescents ranging between
0–20 years of age.
Material and Methods
This study was conducted at the Instituto da Crianc¸a,
Hospital das Clínicas, Faculdade de Medicina da Uni-
versidade de São Paulo, a tertiary university hospital in
São Paulo, from January 2016 to August 2018. One
hundred and three healthy children and adolescents
between 3 months and 20 years of age were selected
for this study. All of the individuals were recruited during
routine pediatric outpatient visits or during preoperative
evaluation for minor surgical procedures, such as pos-
thectomy or inguinal hernia correction. The exclusion criteria
were presence of any chronic or acute systemic disease,
past medical history of any signiﬁcant disease, or corticos-
teroid use in the previous month. All parents or representa-
tives provided informed consent for the use of a small blood
sample for this study, whose protocol was approved by the
HC-FMUSP Ethics Committee (CAPPesq number 335.543).
Blood was drawn for other kinds of analyses requested by
the attending pediatrician or pediatric surgeon.
Peripheral venous blood samples (2–5 mL) were
collected using EDTA Vacutainer blood collection tubes
(Becton-Dickinson, Brazil). Genomic DNA was extracted
from peripheral blood with Qiagen columns (QIAamp DNA
minikit; Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. The DNA concentration and purity were determined
using a NanoVue Plus spectrophotometer (GE Health-
care, UK). TRECs concentrations were analyzed by
real-time quantitative PCR (StepOne PlusTM, Applied
Biosystems, USA) using TaqMan Gene Expression
Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The RT-qPCR reactions
were performed in a ﬁnal volume of 25 mL containing 20
mM TREC primer or ACTB primer, 15 mM 6FAM labeled
TAMRA TREC, and 6VIC-labeled TAMRA ACTB probes
(all from Integrated DNA Technology, USA). In each
reaction, the DNA sample was tested in triplicate. The
measurement of ACTB signal was performed when the
TRECs level of a sample was low (o25 copies/mL of DNA)
(8). The reactions were carried out with an initial cycle at
50°C for 2 min and a heating cycle at 95°C for 10 min,
followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, and 1 min at 60°C.
A standard curve was included in every PCR reaction
for the absolute quantiﬁcation of the number of TRECs
per mL of DNA in each sample. The TREC standard curve
was established using seven 10-fold serial dilutions
that ranged from 102 to 106 TREC copies/mL of plasmids
containing a TREC fragment. All analyzed RT-qPCR
assays fulﬁlled the quality requirements of similar slopes
and R2 values 40.96.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using the statis-
tical package GraphPad Prism version 5.0 (USA). To
investigate the normal distribution of TREC counts, the
Shapiro-Wilk test was used. The Mann-Whitney test was
used to compare quantitative variables between age groups,
and Spearman’s correlation coefﬁcient was used to
correlate quantitative variables. A P-value of less than
0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant in all analyses.
Results
The mean age of the sample was 4.98±4.63 (range
0–20 years). The mean total TREC count was 136.77±
96.7 copies/mL of DNA. The individuals were divided into
7 age groups (Table 1). TREC content of our sample did
not display a normal distribution. Statistically signiﬁcant
differences were found between the age groups of 3–12
months, 25–36 months, and 37–48 months when com-
pared to the 121–240 months age group. The Spearman
correlation test revealed a signiﬁcant inverse correlation
between TREC values and age (rs=–0.302, P=0.0019)
(Figure 1).
Discussion
The main contribution of the present study was the
investigation of TRECs values in a signiﬁcant number of
healthy young individuals from 0–5 years of age. This is
currently the largest collection of TRECs data in this age

TRECS and thymic function in young children

group, which is when the thymus plays a major role. As
expected from the experimental data, the TRECs values
at an early age were signiﬁcantly higher when compared
to that in the second decade of life, suggesting that
intrathymic proliferation decreased with age, i.e., the
involution of this organ can occur even during childhood
and certainly before adolescence (9).
Interestingly, young children have not only a propor-
tionally large thymus (10) but also large secondary
lymphoid organs, including mucosal-associated organs,
and simultaneous peripheral blood lymphocytosis (11,12).
Thus far, this phenomenon has not been completely
understood. In parallel to the well-known large thymus in
early life, our data suggest that thymic function is also
increased during this period.
It has previously been shown that males have reduced
thymic function, but we were unable to conﬁrm this
observation
since
our
sample
population
comprised
mostly male subjects. There is also evidence that preterm
and low-birth-weight babies have lower TRECs levels at
birth, but this variable was not controlled for in our study;
our youngest baby was 3 months old. Other factors that
could affect TREC values in healthy individuals, such as
ethnic background, oxidative stress, and exposure to
pollution, could not be controlled for.
The thymus is not evaluated on a daily basis by
clinicians, which is mainly because the thymus is
anatomically difﬁcult to access for histopathological
studies, but also due to the information gap regarding
its function. We expect that this research will highlight
the relevance of the thymus in the ﬁrst years of life
and stimulate physicians, particularly pediatricians, to
be more aware about the function of this organ. Since
TRECs measurements are an easy and low-cost way
of evaluating thymic function, physicians should famil-
iarize themselves with and more commonly perform
day-to-day analyses of the thymus. We hope our data
may contribute to this goal by stimulating interest and
raising awareness of possible thymic aggressions in
daily clinical practice.
