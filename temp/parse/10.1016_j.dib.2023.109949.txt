Canary Islands, Spain (Original data) 
a b s t r a c t 
In 2021, the Tajogaite Volcano erupted along the western 
slope of the Cumbre Vieja on the island of La Palma, Ca- 
nary Islands, Spain. Volcanic tephra blanketed a substantial 
proportion of the island. By our estimations, approximately 
23,0 0 0,0 0 0 m3 of pyroclastic ashes and more coarse-grained 
particles were deposited unto La Palma’s land surface in ad- 
dition to the lava ﬂow. Five months following the initial 
eruption, we measured the depth of the new ash layer across

the island. We combined this data with drone-based obser- 
vations to compile a dataset comprising the point distribu- 
tion of ash depth. A spatial interpolation was then performed 
using Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) to estimate the ash 
depth across the island at a 2 m spatial resolution. The in- 
terpolation performed well, yielding a root mean squared er- 
ror (RMSE) value of 0.34 and thus, the dataset offers im- 
mense reuse potential for spatial inquiries related to evolu- 
tionary traits, vegetation patterns, and vegetation response 
to disturbance on oceanic islands. In addition, the data can 
be used to test different spatial interpolation techniques 
in an effort to improve the accuracy achieved using IDW.

Data collection 
A total of 415 in-situ ﬁeld measurements were sampled across the Island of La Palma 
using a spade and measuring tape. Holes were dug until the previous soil surface 
(oxidized discoloration) or bedrock was reached. Holes were dug to a maximum of 150 
cm for safety precaution and as many holes were dug at this maximum depth as 
possible to improve the accuracy of the interpolation. The coordinates of each 
measurement were noted for subsequent compilation of the shapeﬁle product. 
Close to the crater, where ash depth exceeded 150 cm, the difference between a digital 
surface model from drone based structure from motion photogrammetry published by 
Civico et al. [11] and a 2 m Digital Terrain Model (DTM) from CNIG [12] was 
calculated. These 66 surface change values were used to accurately complete the 
tephra depth training dataset in areas not suitable for in-situ sampling. 
An interpolation was calculated for the entirety of the 481 points in the dataset using 
the Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) interpolation approach. The interpolation 
yielded tephra depth at 2 m spatial resolution for the extent of the terrestrial surface 
of La Palma. This was exported in GeoTIFF format.

1. Value of the Data 
• This dataset is valuable to researchers keen on exploring the effects of the 2021 Tajogaite 
eruption (La Palma, Canary Islands, Spain) on successional trajectories of the vegetation, 
changes in topography, soil formation, and selective evolutionary processes. 
• This dataset is constructed using deterministic interpolation and demonstrates the utility 
of using spatial interpolation techniques to estimate tephra deposition processes. Our es- 
timation of the total tephra volume across the terrestrial extent of La Palma was on par 
with more sophisticated methods [1] . This contributes to a novel ﬁeld of research: pyro- 
clastic deposits and sedimentation estimation. 
• Researchers may use this dataset to explore fundamental evolutionary processes unique to 
oceanic islands, where volcanic activity is the primary disturbance regime, by comparing 
this case study with processes on other oceanic islands of the world. 
• The dataset is suitable for monitoring changes to water availability and subsequent 
changes to the local water cycle due to ash deposition and investigate how these inﬂuence 
surrounding vegetation and freshwater provision to the local human population. 
2. Objective 
Volcanic eruptions have a strong impact on surrounding ecosystems. The recent eruption of 
the Tajogaite volcano on the island of La Palma, Spain, between the 19th of September and the 
13th of December 2021, severely damaged the ﬂora and fauna within 2.5 km around the erup- 
tion [2] . The surrounding Canary Pine forests were signiﬁcantly affected, which suffered chlorotic 
damage from exposure to volcanic gases [3 , 4] . In addition, large amounts of eruptive pyroclastic 
material were deposited (ﬁne ashes and more coarse-grained particles, dependent on the inten- 
sity of and the distance to the eruption) as a tephra layer over a large part of the island ( Fig. 1 ). 
Tephra deposits are known to affect all aspects of vegetation recovery after volcanic eruptions 
[5 , 6] . They can completely reset the seed bank already with approximately 10 cm thickness [7] . 
It is postulated that the depth of the tephra deposits functions as a selective evolutionary driver 
[8] . In addition, the tephra layer will likely affect the water cycle and nutrient availability in 
affected ecosystems and will leach volcanic compounds for many months and years [9 , 10] . We 
have, therefore, created an interpolated dataset of tephra depth all over La Palma, which will be 
crucial in successfully monitoring vegetation recovery in the coming years after the eruption. 
3. Data Description 
The dataset consists of two ﬁles: (1) a shapeﬁle (with supporting .dbf, .shx, .qmd, .prj, and 
.cpg ﬁles) consisting of 481 total tephra depth measurements that were either recorded in the 
ﬁeld (415 points) or extracted from the drone data (66 points) provided by Civico et al. [11] ; 
( Fig. 2 ) (2) the output tephra interpolation raster ﬁle. 
The shapeﬁle’s point measurements (ﬁeld: “ash_ﬁeld”) were used as input data for our IDW 
interpolation. The tephra interpolation raster ﬁle covers the full extent of La Palma’s land surface 
at 2 m spatial resolution with ash depth values (in cm) ranging from 0 (no ash layer) to 691.219. 
The maximum value indicates the largest recorded measurement as the interpolation is conﬁned 
to the minimum and maximum of the measured values. We then added the interpolated values 
to the point shapeﬁle as an additional ﬁeld (ﬁeld: “ash_idw”). From here, we could assess the 
accuracy of the interpolation by calculating the RMSE. The RMSE of the interpolation is 0.34.

4. Experimental Design, Materials and Methods 
4.1. Tephra layer ﬁeld measurements 
Tephra depth, as the total of all airborne pyroclastic sediments of different grain sizes, was 
measured at 415 sampling points distributed over the island ( Fig. 2 ). Only undisturbed, ﬂat sur- 
faces were sampled. Holes were dug until a remarkable color change to the weathered (oxi- 
dized) previous soil surface was observed, or until bedrock was reached. Historic tephra layers, 
e.g. from the 1949 volcanic San Juan eruption, could also be distinguished due to a stark color 
difference due to weathering and oxidation as well as the presence of a subfossil organic litter 
layer ( Fig. 3 ). Closer to the volcano, the tephra layer reached several meters of depth. Due to 
time and safety constraints, holes were dug to a maximum depth of 150 cm. To later improve 
interpolation accuracy, as many sampling holes were dug close to 150 cm depth as possible. 
Additional evidence due to construction works showed tephra layers of more than 3 m. 
To ﬁll in the gaps of our sampling close to the volcanic crater, where the tephra was too deep 
to sample, and to appropriately represent the thick tephra layer closer to the crater, two remote 
sensing data products were evaluated for their accuracy. Data points were then extracted from 
the more accurate of the two products. The ﬁrst product used was elevation change data from 
Copernicus Emergency Management System (EMS) EMSN119 [13] . The data product uses a Span- 
ish Lidar-based Digital Terrain Model (DTM) from 2015 [12] combined with optical Pléiades Tri- 
Stereo data to calculate a surface change layer for both the lava stream and crater surroundings. 
The RMSE given for elevation calculations of the Pléiades data used is 0.79 m, which is not accu- 
rate enough for the shallow tephra layers but suﬃcient for the massive tephra deposits around

the craters. The second product evaluated was a Digital Surface Model (DSM) derived from over 
12,0 0 0 drone photographs coupled with structure-from-motion photogrammetry [11] with a cal- 
culated RMSE of 0.26 m. A digital terrain model (DTM) with 2 m spatial resolution [12] was sub- 
tracted from the DSM provided by Civico et al. [11] to derive the surface change due to tephra 
deposition. 
Both products show nearly identical surface changes over both the crater and the lava stream 
but differ up to several meters over the tephra-covered surroundings of the crater. The surface 
change values of the drone-derived model are in much better agreement with our ﬁeld measure- 
ments and observations. It was suspected that the uniform surface and color of tephra-covered 
ground decreases the accuracy of Pléiades Tri-Stereo data in the areas around the craters and 
lava stream. Nonetheless, we elected the Civico et al. [11] data. The difference caused by tephra 
was extracted for 66 manually selected data points close to the crater, bringing the total number 
of samples to 481 points. The presence of Pinus canariensis individuals introduced errors in the 
DSM. Therefore, only data from forest gaps was used. In addition, while the overall accuracy of

Civico et al. [11] was very high, only sites with a difference of at least 3 meters were selected to 
minimize errors introduced by methodological differences in the models. 
4.2. Interpolation using IDW 
An interpolation of the tephra layer data was performed at 2 m resolution using Inverse Dis- 
tance Weighting (IDW) ( Fig. 1 ). IDW is an exact deterministic interpolation method that predicts 
values of unknown points within the range of the measured values by averaging the weighted 
distance between sample points [14] . The interpolation was calculated using the Spatial Analyst 
toolbox in ArcMap 10.8.1 [15] . This toolbox was selected since our dataset was not large enough 
to warrant using other Esri toolboxes, such as the Geostatistical Analyst [16] . The dataset was 
compiled to later estimate the surface volume of the ash layer as a 2-dimensional layer, and 
thus the 3D Analyst toolbox was not necessary either. The parameters set for the IDW interpo- 
lation can be viewed in Table 1 .

Although geostatistical interpolation methods such as kriging are typically favored for spatial 
interpolations [17 , 18] , IDW yielded a better RMSE value for our data (0.34) when compared with 
ordinary kriging (OK) in the same ESRI Spatial Analyst toolbox. Adopting more advanced varia- 
tions of kriging, for example with external drift (KED) or gradient plus inverse distance squared 
(GIDS), could improve accuracy if parameterized appropriately [18] . However, the performance 
of an interpolation is often dependent on context and the accuracy metric utilized. Since spatial 
interpolations have been widely deployed in environmental sciences, they have diverse appli- 
cations and are diﬃcult to compare. For example, Li and Heap [18] compared the performance 
of over 70 spatial interpolation methods and sub-methods, including combined methods, across 
80 environmental variables. They found that though kriging often performed better than non- 
geostatistical methods, factors such as sampling design may heavily impact performance. Given 
the high performance of the IDW interpolation of our in-situ tephra measurements, IDW was 
selected as a suitable interpolation method for our dataset. 
IDW operates using a power parameter that raises the inverse of the distance to a mathemat- 
ical power, thereby permitting control over the signiﬁcance of measure values [16] . The higher 
the power parameter, the more signiﬁcant the observed value becomes, and a coarser surface 
layer is achieved. A relatively gradual deposition of tephra was observed in the ﬁeld and thus 
the power was limited to the default value of 2, which reﬂects a smoother surface in the result- 
ing product. This is deemed more realistic given that in-situ sampling occurred several months 
following the end of the volcanic eruption, where wind and runoff may have neutralized any 
marginal differences in the surface proﬁle during the time of sampling. The IDW input parame- 
ters in Table 1 were selected based on performance when compared to other IDW model runs. 
Interpolation performance was assessed by how well the model agreed with what was observed 
during the ﬁeld campaign. Despite running the model several times with adjusted parameters, 
such as the power, search neighborhood type, number of neighbors and sector type, the default 
parameter settings were the most optimal for our input dataset. The only parameter that was 
not a default value was the output cell size (2 m).
