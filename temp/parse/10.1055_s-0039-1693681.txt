Abstract
Objective
To analyze the effects of estrogen alone or in combination with proges-
togens and tibolone (TIB) on the expression of the extracellular matrix metalloprotei-
nases 2 and 9 (MMP-2 and MMP-9), of perlecan, and of heparanase (HPSE) of the
vascular walls of the carotid arteries.
Methods
A total of 30 250-day-old ovariectomized Wistar rats were orally treated for
5 weeks with: a) 1 mg/kg of estradiol benzoate (EB); b) EB þ 0.2 mg/kg of medrox-
yprogesterone acetate (MPA); c) EB þ 0.2mg/kg of norethisterone acetate (NETA); d)
EB þ 2 mg/kg of dydrogesterone (DI); e) 1 mg/kg of TIB; f) placebo (CTR). Following
treatment, the expression of mRNA for MMP-2, MMP-9, and HPSE was analyzed by real-
time polymerase chain-reaction (PCR), and the expression of MMP-2, of MMP-9, of
tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP-2), and of perlecan was quantiﬁed by
immunohistochemistry in the carotid arteries.
Results
The groups showed signiﬁcant differences on mRNA HPSE expression
(p ¼ 0.048), which was higher in the EB, EB þ MPA, and TIB groups. There was no
statistically signiﬁcant difference in mRNA MMP-2 or MMP-9 expression. The immuno-
histochemical expression of MMP-2, of TIMP-2, of MMP-9, of HPSE, and of perlecan
showed no differences between groups.
Conclusion
Estradiol alone or associated with MPA and TIB treatment can increase
mRNA HSPE expression of the walls of the carotid arteries in ovariectomized rats.

Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the main cause of death in
postmenopausal women. Evidence show that hypoestrogen-
ism is directly involved in the risk of CDV, mainly of coronary
heart disease.1,2 The impact of estrogen therapy on cardiovas-
cular risk is related to the “optimal window opportunity,” in
which starting the therapy in the ﬁrst years of menopause is
thought to be beneﬁcial. This effect is probably related to the
ability of estrogen to stimulate the expression of extracellular
matrix proteases (MMPs).3 The extracellular MMPs belong to
theendoproteinasefamilyandhavethefunctionofremodeling
the extracellular matrix in physiological as well as in patho-
logical processes.4,5 They maintain the homeostasis of the
extracellular matrix through regulated degradation and depo-
sition of its components, which contribute toward vascular
remodeling. The increase in extracellular matrix degradation
by MMPs in atheromatous plaques can explain the instability
of the plaque and the consequent cardiovascular event. Metal-
loproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP-2 and MMP-9) are strongly
associated with atherosclerotic plaque instability.6 Perlecan
is another important extracellular matrix component belong-
ing to the proteoglycan family, which plays an important role
by interacting with growth factors, such as ﬁbroblast growth
factors (FGFs), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), vascular
endothelial growth factors (VEGFs), inter alia, and controlling
signaling thereof.7 Perlecan contains a domain which is a
receptor for low-density lipoprotein (LDL),8 and its ability to
retain LDL in the extracellular matrix can be related to the
development of atherosclerotic plaque.9 Lastly, heparanase
(HPSE)
is
another
extracellular
matrix enzyme,
which
degrades heparan sulfate molecules and has procoagulant
activity, which can be increased by estrogen.10 The involve-
mentof metalloproteinases and ofother extracellular MMPs in
atherosclerotic disease and atheromatous plaque instability
incited research to correlate their function with hormone
therapy. A previous study by our group revealed that estrogen
therapy is associated with higher expression of MMP-2, of
MMP-9, of and perlecan in the walls of carotid arteries.11
Therefore, there was interest in identifying the effect of
differentcombinations of progestogens with estrogen therapy,
and also the effects of tibolone (TIB) therapy. The aim of the
present study was to evaluate the effects of estrogen and
progestogens, including TIB, on the expression of extracellular
MMPs and proteases of the carotid arteries.
Methods
All of the protocol procedures were approved by the animal
research ethics committee of the Faculdade de Medicina do
ABC, Santo André, state of São Paulo, Brazil. In this animal
experimental study, a total of 30 250-day old Wistar rats were
randomly selected and subjected to bilateral oophorectomy,
under anesthesia with ketamine and xylazine injected intra-
peritoneally. The ventral longitudinal abdominal approach was
used for identifying and ligating the ovarian pedicles and then
removing the gonads.Threeweeksafter thesurgicalprocedure,
a microscopical analysis of vaginal smears of all of the rats was
performed to conﬁrm hypoestrogenism. Subsequently, the
animals were randomly divided into 6 groups of 5 animals
each, and the groups received one of the following treatments
administered daily by gavage for 5 consecutive weeks: EB
group: estradiol benzoate (EB) administered orally in a dose
of 1 mg/kg; EB/MPA group: EB 1 mg/kg combined with

(NETA) 0.2 mg/kg; EB/DI group: EB 1 mg/kg combined with
dydrogesterone (DI) 2 mg/kg; TIB group: TIB 1 mg/kg; CTR
group: oral placebo. The animals were kept in a calm environ-
ment with a constant temperature of 23°C, a 12 hour light
period per day, and water and food ad libitum. At the end of
the treatment period, the rats were euthanized in a CO2
chamber. The right and left carotid arteries were immediately
dissectedandresected.Therightcarotidarterieswereplacedin
containers with RNA-preserving reagent, RNAholder (RNAla-
terTM, Ambion, Inc., Austin, Texas, USA), and stored at - 20°C
until total RNA was extracted from each sample. The mRNA
complementary strand (cDNA) was obtained, and the genes for
heparanase (HPSE), MMP-2 and MMP-9 were ampliﬁed. The
left carotid arteries were ﬁxed in 10% buffered formalin for
subsequent immunohistochemical analysis of the protein ex-
pression of HPSE, MMP-2, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase
2 (TIMP-2), MMP-9, and perlecan.
Total RNA Extraction from the Tissues, Obtaining cDNA
from the Total RNA, and Quantitative Real-time
Polymerase Chain Reaction
The detailed procedures for extracting total RNA from the
tissues, obtaining cDNA from the total RNA, and real-time
polymerase
chain
reaction
(PCR)
have
been
previously
published.11 Brieﬂy, total RNA was extracted after the carotid
arterytissuehadbeen homogenized inliquid nitrogen byadding
theTRIzolreagent(ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc,Waltham, MA,USA)
and following the protocol of the manufacturer. Total RNA in
each sample was quantiﬁed using a GeneQuant RNA/DNA
Calculator (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). Following total
RNA extraction, the cDNA was obtained using the RT-PCR Super
Script II kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and following the
protocol of the manufacturer. The cDNAobtainedwasstored in a
freezer at- 20°C until it was used in the real-time PCR reactions.
The real-time PCR was performed using cDNA (1 µg/µL) from
each sample to quantify the metalloproteinase isoforms and
HPSE in the tissue using primers and the ribosomal glyceralde-
hyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as a reference gene
for the reaction. For real-time PCR ampliﬁcation, the SYBRGreen
reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA) and a
7500 real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA) were used, and the ampliﬁcation curves were analyzed
using the software that comes with the system. Since the
expression of the enzymes is relative, the calculation was based
on the number of ampliﬁcation cycles (Cts), and the ﬁnal result
was obtained in relation to the average Cts of the reference gene.
All of the mRNA quantiﬁcations were performed in triplicate for
each sample, and the average of the triplicate was used as the
ﬁnal value in the analysis.
Immunohistochemistry
The detailed procedures for the immunohistochemical analysis
have been previously published.11 Brieﬂy, the immunohis-
tochemistrywasperformed toanalyzeproteinimmunolabeling
for metalloproteinases, perlecan, and HPSE in 3 µm-thick
histological slices. The primary antibodies used were anti-
MMP-2 8B4 (sc-13595), anti-MMP-9 C-120 (sc-6840), anti-
TIMP-2 H-140 (sc-5539), anti-perlecan H-300 (sc-25848), and
anti-HPSE: HPA1 H-80 (sc-25825) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Inc., Dallas, TX, USA) diluted in bovine serum albumin (BSA) in a
ratio of 1:300. The slides were analyzed using a Nikon Eclipse
TS100 optic microscope (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY, USA)
using the same light intensity and condenser height for all
slides. The areas that best represented the immunolabeling of
the slide were chosen and analyzed at a 400x magniﬁcation.
Photomicrographs (640  480 pixels) of consecutive, nonover-
lapping ﬁelds were obtainedusing a Nikon Coolpix 4300 (Nikon
Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) digital camera with maximum
optical zoom. Immunohistochemical labeling was quantiﬁed
using the Scion ImageLab for Windows software (Scion Corpo-
ration, Frederick, MD, USA).
Statistical Analysis
The data obtained was organized in electronic spreadsheets
using the Microsoft Excel 2007 software (Microsoft Corpora-
tion, Redmond, WA, USA). The statistical analysis was per-
formed using the software WinSTAT, version 2007.1 (R. Fitch
Software, Cambridge, MA, USA). Continuous numerical dataare
presented in the average  standard deviation (SD) format.
Normal distributionwas tested using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test. Group comparisons were performed by analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA), and multiple comparisons were corrected using
the least signiﬁcant difference method. The Kruskal-Wallis test
was performed for datawithout a normal distribution, or when
homogeneity of variance had not been proven. A signiﬁcance
level of 5% was adopted.
Results
A rat from the TIB group was found dead one morning
showing signs of having been attacked by the other rats in
the group. Therefore, information from 29 animals was
analyzed. ►Table 1 shows the results for the relative quanti-
ﬁcation of mRNA for HPSE (HPSE[RNA]), MMP-2 (MMP-2[RNA]),
and MMP-9 (MMP-9[RNA]) for each group. A statistically
signiﬁcant difference can be noted on HPSE mRNA expres-
sion, with higher values in the EB, EB/MPA and TIB groups.
Although there is no statistically signiﬁcant difference, the
TIB and CTR groups showed higher levels of MMP-2[RNA] and
MMP-9[RNA] expression.
Regarding the immunohistochemistry results, as shown
in ►Table 2, there was no statistically signiﬁcant difference
among the groups for any evaluated parameters. It is interest-
ing to note, however, that the CTR group had lower median
levels for all extracellular matrix components analyzed when
compared with the other groups.
Discussion
As far as we know, this is the ﬁrst study that endeavored to
compare the greatest number of estroprogestative combina-
tions in terms of expression of proteases of the extracellular
matrix of the vascular walls. The results show a difference
among the treated groups only for HPSE mRNA expression.

The median values of MMP-2 and MMP-9 mRNA expres-
sion were lower in groups treated with estrogen or with
estrogen combined with progestogens when compared with
those treated with TIB or placebo. These could be explained
by mere chance, since this difference has no statistical
signiﬁcance. However, the TIB and CRT groups results were
too disperse, with a higher SD, compromising the analysis of
the data. The authors suspect that estrogen decreases those
metalloproteases mRNA expression and signiﬁcant differ-
ences were not seen because small sample size, treatment
duration or therapy doses.
With respect to HPSE mRNA expression, the only param-
eter that showed differences between groups, the maximum
values were observed in the TIB, EB and EB/MPA groups,
although with no statistical signiﬁcance in multiple compar-
isons. Apparently, the progestogens dydrogesterone and
norethisterone acetate reduced the effect attributable to
estrogen. This is in line with ﬁndings that this progestogen
can reduce some estrogen effects.12
Surprisingly, the immunohistochemistry results did not
replicate this signiﬁcant ﬁnding for HPSE. A possible explana-
tion for this apparent discrepancy between RNA levels encod-
ing the enzyme and the actual level of protein in the vascular
extracellular matrix could be a simultaneous increase in deg-
radationoftheRNAencoding thisprotein,orinthedegradation
of the actual protein, suggesting a greater turnover. This fact
was also observed in a previous publication by our group.11
In contrast to an earlier publication, we did not observe in
the present study an increase in the expression of MMP-2 or of
MMP-9 with estrogen therapy, and this could be due to
estradioldegradationimpactedbyportalhepaticcirculation.11
However, it is important to highlight that the present study
did not evaluate the degradation of the involved extracellular
matrix proteins or of nucleic acids. On the other hand, the
intention of including TIMP-2 was to know whether it would
increasefollowing the eventual increase of MMP-2. This would
justify the lack of immunohistochemical alteration for tissue
expression; however, the authors were not able to observe an
increase in MMP-2, neither in TIMP-2.
In line with our ﬁndings, some studies have not found an
increase in serum levels of MMP-9 in women treated with
estrogen; however, in these studies, metalloproteinase was
not analyzed in tissue, but only in plasma.13,14 On the other
hand, thereisevidence ofanincrease inserumlevelsofMMP-9
in women with coronary arterial disease who received estro-
gen.15 It is worth noting that, in this study, conjugated equine
estrogens were administered orally,15 while in the Christo-
doulakos GE et al study, the estrogen used was estradiol,13 and
Wakatsuki et al14 administered conjugated equine estrogens
orally or estradiol transdermally.
Marfella et al16 found lower levels of MMP-9 in atheroscle-
roticplaquesinwomenwhousehormonereplacement therapy
than in the plaques of women who have never undergone this
treatment.However,itshouldbepointedout that theseauthors
studied atherosclerotic plaques directly, while we have evalu-
ated arteries with no apparent disease.
Sophonsritsuk et al17 reported that oral estradiol reduces
MMP-9 expression in carotid arteries of female monkeys,
irrespective of the postmenopausal period, although some
inﬂammation markers had lower expression in monkeys in
early menopause when compared with late menopause.
Lekontseva et al18 reported a reduction in MMP-2 levels in
the mesentericarteriesofcastratedratswho receivedestrogen
when compared with those who were not treated.
We have not found any other study that compares as many
progestogens as our does; however, in a study involving a

cellular model, Hwang-Levine et al19 observed that medroxy-
progesterone acetate tended to increase MMP-9 activity in the
absence of estradiol while progesterone reduced it; however,
the effects were the opposite when estradiol was present.
Although we did not observe any statistically signiﬁcant
difference in our study, there is a suggestion that medroxypro-
gesterone acetate reduced the effect of estradiol on the expres-
sion
of
MMP-2,
of
MMP-9
and
of
perlecan
in
the
immunohistochemistry assays. This should be the basis for
new studies.
One of the limitations of the present study was the small
sample size, which reduced the potential for detecting differ-
ences among the groups. Had the sample size been larger, it is
possible that differences could have gained statistical signiﬁ-
cance. Also, degradation of extracellular matrix proteases was
not measured, neither of the nucleic acids involved. Another
relevant point is that the present study evaluated normal
arteries, and it is possible that the steroid effects studied would
have been different on arteries with atherosclerotic disease.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we have found differences among the groups in
the expression of HPSE mRNA, and the highest values were
observed in the animals treated with TIB, EB, and EB/MPA. The
effects of sex steroids on the expression of extracellular MMPs
are complex, and are probably dependent on an intricate
interaction with other factors, which explains the limited
agreement among existing studies. Despite the present study
not having revealed statistical signiﬁcance in the expression of
carotid matrix components among treatments with different
progestogens, our ﬁndings suggest that differentiated effects
according to the progestogens used can exist. This information
is important, considering the possibility of identifying pro-
gestagen with greater potential for endothelial harm and
worse cardiovascular outcome in women. Also, these results
could contribute toward outlining new studies.
