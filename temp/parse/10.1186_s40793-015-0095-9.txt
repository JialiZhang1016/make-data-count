Abstract
A novel Dehalococcoides sp. strain UCH007 was isolated from the groundwater polluted with chlorinated ethenes in
Japan. This strain is capable of dechlorinating trichloroethene, cis-1,2-dichloroethene and vinyl chloride to ethene.
Dehalococcoides bacteria are hardly cultivable, so genome sequencing has presented a challenge. In this study, we
developed a differential reads picking method for mixed genomic DNA obtained from a co-culture, and applied it
to the sequencing of strain UCH007. The genome of strain UCH007 consists of a 1,473,548-bp chromosome that
encodes 1509 coding sequences including 29 putative reductive dehalogenase genes. Strain UCH007 is the first
strain in the Victoria subgroup found to possess the pceA, tceA and vcrA genes.

Introduction
Chloroethenes such as PCE, TCE cis-1,2-DCE and VC in
contaminated soil and groundwater can be removed by
reductive dechlorination mediated by anaerobic bacteria.
Under anaerobic conditions, dehalorespiring bacteria de-
chlorinate chloroethenes by mediating the step-wise re-
placement of chlorine with hydrogen resulting in the
conversion of PCE to TCE, DCE isomers, VC, and eth-
ene sequentially. Among many dehalorespiring bacterial
isolates, only a few strains of the genus Dehalococcoides
completely convert chloroethenes to nontoxic ethene,
hence they are indispensable for successful bioremediation
applications [1–10]. The RDases are essential enzymes for
the dehalorespiring activities of Dehalococcoides ssp., how-
ever, the constitution of RDase genes in each strain varies
significantly, resulting in varied dechlorination activities
among strains. Among the RDase genes, vcrA and bvcA,
which
dechlorinate VC to ethene are
essential for
complete dechlorination.
In our previous report, we constructed a chloroethene-
dechlorinating
microbial
consortium
derived
from
chloroethene-polluted groundwater in Japan, and identi-
fied some operational taxonomic units that were assigned
to Dehalococcoides by amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA
genes [11]. In this report, we describe a Dehalococcoides
bacterium designated strain UCH007 isolated from the
consortium, and present its complete genome sequence.
Strain UCH007, the first Dehalococcoides strain isolated in
Japan, was phylogenetically affiliated with the Victoria
subgroup of the Dehalococcoides.
Organism information
Classification and features
A cis-1,2-DCE-to-ethene dechlorinating enrichment cul-
ture was obtained from the microbial consortium [11]
by sequentially transferring to fresh media amended with
acetate plus H2-CO2 (80 %:20 %, vol/vol) in the head-
space and cis-1,2-DCE as the electron acceptor. Follow-
ing repeated transfers to cis-1,2-DCE amended media in
the presence of ampicillin or 2-bromoethanesulfonate,
several series of dilution-to-extinction culturing and sev-
eral agar shake processes were performed, and strain
UCH007 was obtained in pure culture.

The cells of strain UCH007 were non-motile, non-
spore forming and had a disc-shaped morphology with a
diameter of 0.1–0.3 μm (Fig. 1). The temperature range
for growth of strain UCH007 was between 15 and 35 °C,
with optimum growth between 25 and 30 °C. The pH
range for growth of strain UCH007 was between 6.2 and
7.7, with an optimum pH between 7.0 and 7.3. The
range of NaCl concentrations that allowed for growth of
strain UCH007 was 0–1.5 %, with an optimum concen-
tration of 0.3–0.5 %.
Strain UCH007 is a strictly anaerobic bacterium,
and its growth depends on the presence of hydrogen
as an electron donor, reductive dechlorination sub-
strates such as TCE, cis-1,2-DCE, 1,1-DCE and VC as
electron acceptors and acetate as a carbon source.
Vitamin B12 is essential for growth. The strain was
observed to accumulate varying amounts of VC dur-
ing TCE (or cis-1,2-DCE)-to-ethene dechlorination,
but growth tended to be coupled with the reductive
dechlorination of VC.
Dehalococcoides strains isolated to date shared more
than 98 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with each
other, and grouped into three subgroups designated the
Pinellas, Victoria and Cornell subgroups [1]. Phylogen-
etic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences shows
that strain UCH007 belonged to the Victoria subgroup,
and the most closely related strain was D. mccartyi
strain VS with 99.92 % similarity (Fig. 2). The most
distantly related strain was D. mccartyi strain CBDB1
with 98.91 % similarity.

Genome sequencing information
Genome project history
Strain UCH007 is the first Dehalococcoides isolate from
Japan and is one of the few strains found to convert
toxic chloroethenes to nontoxic ethene. It was selected
for sequencing on the basis of its rarity and importance
in bioremediation. Table 1 presents the project informa-
tion and its association with MIGS version 2.0 compli-
ance [12]. A summary of the project information is
shown in Table 2.
Growth conditions and genomic DNA preparation
Strain UCH007 was pure-cultured in 300 mL of bi-
carbonate-buffered medium supplemented with 10 μM of
cis-1,2-DCE for 47 days [3], however, the number of cells
was insufficient for genome sequencing using next-
generation sequencers. So, WGA using the pure culture
as a template was performed using the REPLI-g Mini Kit
(Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) according to the man-
ufacturer’s instructions.
Strain UCH007 was also co-cultured with Sulfurospiril-
lum cavolei UCH003 [13] in bicarbonate-buffered medium
for 36 days. Cells were harvested from 100 mL of the
culture by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). Total
DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit
(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
effects of strain UCH003 on the growth of strain UCH007,
will be described in a separate report (manuscript in
preparation).
Genome sequencing and assembly
It was difficult to obtain sufficient genomic DNA for
direct shotgun sequencing from the pure culture of
strain UCH007. It was also difficult to construct a
complete genome sequence using reads generated by
WGA because of the high abundance of chimeric reads.
Therefore, direct shotgun sequencing was performed
using the mixed genomic DNA obtained from the co-
culture. Then, the differential reads picking method
(Fig. 3) was applied to pick up reads that originated from
strain UCH007.
The DNA obtained by WGA was sequenced using a
454 GS FLX Titanium pyrosequencer (Roche, Basel,
Switzerland), and generated 85,621 reads (WGA reads).

The mixed genomic DNA extracted from the co-culture
was directly sequenced using 454 GS FLX and Illumina
MiSeq sequencers (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), and
generated 213,427 reads and 3,332,948 reads with 251 bp
paired-end sequencing, respectively (DS reads). The reads
from the MiSeq were trimmed using sickle software with
default parameters [14].
After assembling the DS reads from the 454 GS
FLX using Newbler 2.6 (Roche) (Fig. 3; Step 1), the
WGA reads were mapped to the resulting contigs
using Newbler 2.8 (Fig. 3; Step 2). The DS reads
from the 454 GS FLX that were contained in the
mapped contigs were recovered, these were consid-
ered to originate from strain UCH007, yielding 47,262
reads (29,841,879 bp) (Fig. 3; Step 3). Next, these reads
and 2.5 million paired-end reads and 8,414 single-end
reads from the MiSeq (approximately 100 × coverage
against the D. mccartyi VS genome) were assembled
using Newbler 2.6 software (Fig. 3; Step 4). Then the
MiSeq reads co-assembled with the 454 GS FLX reads
were picked, yielding 620,022 paired-end reads and 1,874
single-end reads (144,540,399 bp and 383,354 bp, re-
spectively) (Fig. 3; Step 5). Finally, the picked DS reads
both from 454 GS FLX and MiSeq were re-assembled,
yielding 13 contigs (Fig. 3; Step 6). Genome closure was
accomplished by manual adjustment of the assembly
(Fig. 3; Step 7).
Genome annotation
The complete sequence of the chromosome was analyzed
using MiGAP [15], which uses MetaGeneAnnotator [16]
for predicting protein-coding genes, tRNAscan-SE [17] for
tRNA genes and RNAmmer [18] for rRNA genes. The
functions of the predicted protein-coding genes were
assigned based on information in the Uniprot [19], Inter-
pro [20], HAMAP [21] and KEGG [22] databases, and an
in-house database composed of manually curated micro-
bial genome sequences, as reported previously [23]. Genes
in internal clusters were detected using BLASTclust with
thresholds of 70 % covered length and 30 % sequence
identity [24]. Signal peptides and transmembrane helices
were predicted using SignalP [25] and TMHMM [26],
respectively.
Genome properties
The genome of strain UCH007 consisted of a circular
chromosome of 1,473,548 bp with a 46.91 % G+C content.
The chromosome was predicted to contain 1,509 protein
coding genes, 47 tRNA genes and 3 rRNA genes (Table 3
and Fig. 4). The distribution of protein coding genes into
COG functional categories is shown in Table 4.
Insights from the genome sequence
The ANI is becoming widely accepted as a method to
delineate bacterial species, with 95–96 % ANI value

corresponding to 70 % DNA relatedness [27, 28]. Löffler
et al. noted that strains BAV1, CBDB1 and GT (Pinellas
subgroup) showed lower ANI values, 86–87 %, to strain
VS (Victoria subgroup) and strain 195 (Cornell sub-
group) [1]. However, they proposed only one species, D.
mccartyi, to accommodate all six isolates belonging to
three different subgroups because of the high similarity
of gene contents, and morphological and physiological
characteristics. We recalculated ANI values, based on
ANIb using the JSpecies program with default settings,
to make full use of the accumulating genomic sequences
of Dehalococcoides. The results showed that strain
UCH007 was closely related to strains GY50, CG1 and
VS (Victoria subgroup) with 98.52, 97.99 and 97.07 %
ANI values, respectively (Additional file 1: Table S1),
which were above the species threshold [27]. By com-
parison, the strain UCH007 and other members of
Victoria subgroup were more distantly related to strains
195T and CG4 (Cornell subgroup) with ANI values of
89.20–89.40 %, and other strains (Pinellas subgroup)

with ANI values of 85.95–86.96 %. In addition, the
ANI values between the strain 195T or CG4, and
strains in the Pinellas subgroup were 85.22–86.02 %.
Altogether, all strains in each of three subgroups,
each subgroup consisting of at least two strains,
showed ANI values lower than the 95–96 % thresh-
old to all strains in other two subgroups (Additional
file 1: Table S1). These results suggest that three
subgroups of Dehalococcoides are to be considered
three separate species [27].
The genome of strain UCH007 harbors 29 rdhA and
rdhB gene clusters, and four of these 29 RdhA proteins
(UCH007_00760, UCH007_09900, UCH007_09930 and
UCH007_13640) showed low similarities (<55 %) to
those in other strains. HPRs have been designated on
the genomes of strains within the genus Dehalococcoides
[9, 29, 30], and three and 22 rdhA genes in strain
UCH007
locate
in
HPR1
and
HPR2,
respectively
(Fig. 4). Strain BTF08, belonging to the Pinellas sub-
group, was the first strain reported to contain the
pceA, tceA and vcrA genes, encoding key enzymes in
the reductive dechlorination of chloroethenes [9].
Strain UCH007 also contains orthologues of pceA
(UCH007_13880), tceA (UCH007_12670) and vcrA
(UCH007_12960), and is the first example of a strain
containing
these
genes
in
the Victoria
subgroup
(Additional file 2: Table S2). The vcrA gene of strain
UCH007 was detected in a genomic island located
downstream of the ssrA gene as is the case with
other Dehalococcoides strains [9, 31].
Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Re-
peat (CRISPR)-associated genes are detected on the HPR2
in the genome of strain UCH007 (UCH007_13260-13330),
and 40 spacer regions (start position: 1,300,493 bp, end pos-
ition: 1,302,966 bp) are predicted using the CRISPRfinder
program online [32]. CRISPR-associated genes have only
ever been found in the Pinellas subgroup, and strains
CBDB1, DCMB5 and GT [9, 29, 30], so this is the first re-
port of a CRISPR region in the Victoria subgroup. A bi-
directional BLASTP search of the CRISPR-associated pro-
teins showed sequence identity of more than 73 % be-
tween strain UCH007 and other strains (Additional file 3:
Table S3). The direct repeat was 29 bp in length, and the
consensus sequence (5′-GTATTCCCCACGCgTGTGGG
GGTGAACCG-3′) was conserved among the four strains,
with the exception of the base shown in lowercase [32].
Therefore, these CRISPRs seem to share a common evolu-
tionary origin.
Conclusions
Here we reported the isolation and complete genome se-
quence of Dehalococcoides strain UCH007, which can
dechlorinate chloroethenes to ethene. The genome se-
quence showed that the strain UCH007 is the first strain
in the Victoria subgroup of Dehalococcoides revealed to
possess pceA, tceA and vcrA genes on the chromosome. As
this strain is currently considered to be used in the bioaug-
mentation of chloroethenes-contaminated groundwater,
this information will be useful for monitoring and improve
the bioaugmentation process through, for example, metage-
nomic and metatranscriptomic analyses.
