ABSTRACT
Objective: Urinary stones with oxalate composition can cause kidney failure. Recent 
fi ndings evidenced that probiotics are effective in reducing oxalate absorption in these 
subjects based on their high colonic absorption levels at baseline. The purpose of this 
study was to evaluate the effect of the simultaneous use of oxalate-degrading bacteria, 
Urtica dioica and T. terrestris extract in reducing urinary oxalate.
Materials and Methods: Anti-urolithiatic activity of Urtica dioica and T. terrestris ex-
tract and probiotic by using ethylene glycol induced rat model. In this study, 4 strains 
of Lactobacillus and 2 strains of Bifi dobacterium and also 2 strains of L. paracasei (that 
showed high power in oxalate degrading in culture media) were used. Male Wistar rats 
were divided into four groups (n=6). The rats of group-I received normal diet (positive 
control group) and groups-II (negative control group), III, IV rats received diet con-
taining ethylene glycol (3%) for 30 days. Groups III rats received Urtica dioica and T. 
terrestris extract. Groups IV rats received extracts + probiotic for 30 days.
Findings: The results show that the use of herbal extracts (Urtica dioica and T. ter-
restris) reduced the level of urinary oxalate and other parameters of urine and serum. 
Also, the accumulation of calcium oxalate crystals in the kidney tissue was signifi -
cantly reduced.
Conclusion: Considering that the formation of calcium oxalate crystals can cause in-
fl ammation and tissue damage in the kidney, the use of herbal extracts with oxalate 
degrading bacteria can be a new therapeutic approach to preventing the formation 
of kidney stones.

INTRODUCTION
Today, kidney stones represent an impor-
tant health problem in many countries. Genetic 
factors, metabolic disturbances (excess oxalate 
synthesis), food and environmental factors are 
among the most important causes of kidney sto-
nes, with 60-80% of human kidney stones induced 
by calcium oxalate (1, 2). In fact, hyperoxaluria is 
one of the major risk factors of calcium oxalate

stone formation due to urinary calcium oxalate 
supersaturation. Oxalates in the human body in-
crease both in endogenous (during the synthesis 
of ascorbic acid) and exogenous(oxalate-rich foo-
ds) (2, 3).There is a direct correlation between oxa-
late dietary intake and the formation of calcium 
oxalate stones. It is believed that the consumption 
of oxalate foods only increase 50-60% urinary 
oxalate (4). Generally, increasing urinary oxala-
te, causes the destruction of kidney tissues, acute 
renal failure and the formation of oxalate crys-
tals in the urethra (3-5). Based on several studies, 
medical herbs contain active substances with a 
therapeutic effect on the kidney and urinary tract 
system (6). Indeed, in Iranian traditional and eth-
nobotanical medicine, medical herbs are used to 
treat kidney diseases and disorders. The traditio-
nal medicine has now gained recognition all over 
the world with several indigenous drugs forming 
an indispensable part of health care (5). Tribulus 
terrestris is an annual plant in the caltrop fami-
ly (Zygophyllaceae) which is widely distributed 
worldwide. It is adapted to grow in dry climate lo-
cations in which few other plants can survive, and 
is an invasive species in Iran and India (7). As with 
many weedy species, this plant has many common 
names, including Goat’s-head, Bindii, Bullhead, 
Burra gokharu, Bhakhdi, and Caltrop (8). Urtica 
dioica, often called common nettle, stinging net-
tle (although not all plants of this species sting) 
or nettle leaf, is a herbaceous perennial flowering 
plant in the family of Urticaceae (9). Originally 
native to Europe, much of temperate Asia and 
western North Africa, it is now found worldwide 
(10). Typically, in the form of creams containing 
antihistamines or hydrocortisone, it provides re-
lief from nettle dermatitis. Also, its diuretic and 
tonic effects contribute to its wide use in painful 
micturition, calculus affections, and other urinary 
disorders (11, 12). The therapeutic value of Urtica 
dioica and T terrestris extracts in lowering expe-
rimental hyperoxaluria has already been reported 
(13-15). Besides, reports indicate that, there is a 
degrading bacterium in the intestine of 70-80% 
of healthy people which solely extracts metabolic 
energy from oxalate (16, 17). Further, some lactic 
acid bacteria (LAB) used in the dairy industry also 
use oxalate as energy source, potentially limiting 
its absorption from the intestinal lumen thereby 
contributing to its decreased excretion from urine 
(17, 18). In 2001, Campieri orally prescribed a fre-
eze-dried preparation composed of five organisms 
(Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. brevis, L. plantarum, 
Bifidobacterium infantis, and Streptococcus ther-
mophiles) to a few hyperoxaluria patients for 30 
days. These probiotics induced a significant decre-
ase in oxalate excretion in the patients (19, 20).In 
addition, dietary supplementation with probiotic 
has emerged as a potential strategy to increase 
dietary oxalate degradation (21-23). Accordingly, 
the purpose of our study was to evaluate the effect 
of simultaneous use of oxalate-degrading probio-
tic bacteria, Urtica dioica and T. terrestris extract 
in reducing urinary oxalate.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experimental animals
	Male Wistar rats weighing 200-250g were 
used in the study. Animals were housed in a labo-
ratory kept at 12 hours light-dark cycle, controlled 
room temperature (23±2ºC), and relative humidi-
ty (50±10%). Also, they were exposed to 0.3% of 
ethylene glycol with 1% ammonium chloride in 
their drinking water for 3 days. Later, 0.3% ethy-
lene glycol in drinking water was continued for 30 
days (23).
Dividing of Male Wistar rats
	Male Wistar rats were divided into 4 
Groups (n=6). Group I received normal diet (po-
sitive control group). Groups II (negative control 
group), III and IV rats received 3% ethylene glycol 
containing diet for 30 days. Groups III received 
Urtica.dioica and T. terrestris extract and Group IV 
rats received extracts + probiotic for 30 days.
Preparation of hydroalcoholic extract of urtica 
dioica and tribulus terrestris
	In this study, 60g of powder of each plant 
(the plants of Urtica dioica and Tribulus terrestris 
were used) with 300mL of ethanol 80%, were pla-
ced in a soxhlet machine for 48 hours. Then, ro-
tary dried the extract. The experiment, the extract 
of the Urtica dioica was used at a concentration 
of 1400g/kg/body weight and from the Tribulus 
IBJU | USING OXALATE-DEGRADING BACYERIA AND HERBAL EXTRACT TO REDUCE OXALURIA
1251
terrestris to 200mg/kg/body weight concentrations 
for each rat. Then they were dissolved in distilled 
water and administered twice daily by gavage (14).
Preparation of probiotic culture
	Bacterial strains used in the study were as 
follow: Lactobacillus acidophilus PTCC1643, Lac-
tobacillus Delbrukii PTCC1737, Lactobacillus plan-
tarum PTCC1745, Lactobacillus casei PTCC1608, 
Bifidobacterium bifidum PTCC1644, Bifidobacte-
rium animalis subsp. lactis PTCC1736, Streptococ-
cus salivarius subsp thermophilus PTCC1738, L. 
paracasei AKPL-IR (JF461540.1), and L. paracasei 
AKKL-IR (JF461539.1). To prepare the bacteria, 
1g of dried cultures was inoculated into 100mL 
of MRS broth medium (Merck, Germany and pla-
ced at 37°C for 6 to 8 hours. 1mL of medium was 
transferred into 99mL of the new MRS broth me-
dium and diluted to 1%. Then, it was placed at 
37°C for 6 to 8 hours. The cultures transferred to 
the fresh medium during the week for the num-
ber of cells needed. Finally, they were kept in a 
refrigerator at 4°C. The probiotic cells were isola-
ted after centrifugation at 4500rpm at 4°C for 10 
minutes. Then, the separated cells were washed 2 
times using the solution of 0.1% peptone (24, 25).
Determining oxalate-degrading capability of 
bacterial strains
	All cultures were incubated in aerobic 
and anaerobic conditions at 37°C for 48 hours. 
Base media containing ammonium oxalate was 
prepared to determine the growth of each strain 
and its dependence on oxalate, as the energy 
source comparing the base media lacked ammo-
nium oxalate. Finally, all selected-strains were 
cultured in an ammonium oxalate plate (20mM, 
40mM and 60mM) to assess their oxalate degra-
ding capability (24, 25).
Survival in a low pH environment and bile salts
	Probiotic strains were evaluated for their 
resistance to low pH and bile salts. Bacterial cells 
were suspended in the MRS broth adjusted with 
1N HCl to pH 2.5. The cells were incubated ana-
erobically at 37°C and their survival was measu-
red at intervals of 0, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 
minutes using the plate count method. Also, re-
sistance to bile was examined using MRS agar 
plates supplemented with 0.5%, 1.0%, and 5.0% 
(w/v) bile (Oxgall; 70168 sigma). Lactobacillus 
species probiotic were inoculated into MRS broth 
and incubated at 37°C under anaerobic conditions 
for 24 hours. Strains were spot inoculated (10µL) 
onto the various concentrations of bile plates and 
incubated at 37°C under anaerobic conditions for 
48 hours. The growth rates on porcine bile plates 
were compared to the growth rate on MRS agar 
plates and recorded (24, 25).
Collecting urine and serum samples
	On 0, 15th, and 30th days of the study pe-
riod the rats were placed in metabolic cages and 
24-hour urine samples were collected in tubes 
containing sodium azide (0.02%) to prevent bac-
terial growth. The specimens were aliquoted for 
various tests after determining their volume and 
pH. Urinary oxalate, calcium, and creatinine were 
assayed using the commercial kit (Darman Keve 
Res, Lab, Isfahan, Iran) in semiautomatic photo-
meter according to manufacturer’s protocol. Each 
week, 1-hour urine samples were collected before 
the start of 24 hours urine sample collection and 
were examined by light microscopy to analyze 
CaOx-crystalluria. The rats were anesthetized with 
Xylasin/Ketamine by intramuscular(IM) injection 
(Xylasin 0.55 and Ketamine 10mg/kg Body wei-
ght) and blood was taken from orbital sinus into 
the centrifuge tube without anticoagulant, allo-
wed to clot at room temperature, and centrifuged 
to collect serum. Sera were tested for creatinine 
and blood urea nitrogen (BUN).
In vivo urinary oxalate levels using selected 
probiotic
	Probiotics (~1011 CFU) prepared in distilled 
water were given to the rats (intervention group) 
for 4 weeks (6 animals in each group). Rats were 
weighed weekly and urine samples were collected 
on weeks 0, 2, and 3, and 4 by placing the animals 
in metabolic cages for 24 hours.
Analysis of histopathology and CaOx crystal in 
kidney
	In this study, CaOx crystal present in each 
kidney tissue was examined by pizzolato staining

1252
methods. At first, the kidney tissue was fixed in 
10% neutral buffered formalin, trimmed, proces-
sed, and set in paraffin. Sections from each kid-
ney were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and 
examined under the light microscope for patholo-
gical analysis and polarized light microscope for 
visualizing CaOx crystal. The presence of CaOx 
crystal was scored on a basis of CaOx. Patholo-
gical analysis was examined with the help of the 
qualified pathologist.
Statistical analysis
	The statistical analysis of the antibody le-
vel between different groups was performed ba-
sed on one-way and two-way ANOVA using SPSS 
version16 and MSTACT software. Statistical signi-
ficance was set at p <0.05.
RESULTS
	Based on the results of day zero (0-day), 
the urine oxalate was high in all groups (except 
for the positive control group). But, on 30th days 
of the study period, concentrate urinary oxalate 
in the negative control group was significantly 
higher than in the intervention and positive con-
trol groups (p <0.05), but there was no significant 
difference between the urinary oxalate concen-
trations among of the intervention and control 
groups. Comparison of urinary oxalate concentra-
tions in each group during the 30 days revealed 
that urinary oxalate concentrations in interven-
tion groups decreased significantly on 30th day 
compared with the first day; in particular, in the 
intervention group (simultaneous use of Urtica 
dioica and T. terrestris extract with probiotic) the 
urinary oxalate concentration was normal. This 
suggests that probiotics are more effective than 
use of plant extracts,alone and without probiotic, 
to reducing urinary oxalate (Figure-1).
	The statistical analysis of urine calcium 
and creatinine concentration showed a significant 
difference between the groups (except in the nega-
tive control group) on both days 0 (zero day) and 
30 (30th day). Specifically, the urinary calcium and 
creatinine on day 0 were high in the intervention 
and negative control groups and were normal in 
the positive control group. However, on the 30th 
day, the urinary calcium and creatinine were still 
high in the negative control group, but there was a 
significant decrease in the intervention group (si-
multaneous use of Urtica dioica and T. terrestris 
extract with probiotic) (Tables 1 and 2).
	Having compared the staining results and 
counting the number of CaOx crystals in the kid-
ney, in negative control groups and intervention 
groups, there was no accumulation of calcium oxa-

late crystals across the crystalline deposition in the 
intervention group and the positive control group 
(after 30 days). On the other hand, in all negative 
control groups, changes in pathology and physio-
logy, including changes in the size of the kidney, 
changes in the color of the tissue, and an increase 
in calcium oxalate crystalline concentrations were 
observed. Therefore, the relative decline in forming 
crystals in the intervention group suggests a posi-
tive effect of simultaneous use of Urtica dioica and 
T. terrestris extract with probiotics to reduce the 
accumulation of CaOx crystals (Figures 2 and 3).
	Also, in the serum analysis, concentra-
te creatinine and BUN at zero day and 30th day 
were higher in the negative group than in other 
groups, and this difference was significant betwe-
en the negative and intervention groups. Also, 
serum creatinine comparison on 30th day showed 
reduction of creatinine and BUN on 30th day com-
pared with the first day in the intervention group 
(simultaneous use of Urtica dioica and T. terres-
tris extract with probiotic bacteria), which was 
more significant. Hence, within 30 days, the level 
of serum creatinine and BUN in the intervention 
group was not significantly different with that in 
the positive control (Table-3). As seen in Tables 
1-4, changes were observed in the level of urinary 
and serum parameters at the end of the treatment 
period (after 30 days). In the healthy control group 
(C-group), changes in urinary and serum parame-
ters were not observed at the end of the period (p 
>0.05). But, in the negative control group (N-group) 
that consumed ethylene glycol daily for 30 days, 
at the end of the period, increased calcium oxala-
te crystals and renal impairment, were a significant 
association with ethylene glycol consumption )p 
<0.05(. And in Table-4, it is shown that there was 
a decrease in the levels of urinary oxalate and the

amount of calcium oxalate crystals deposition in 
the two groups treated with herbal extracts alone 
(TU-group) and the group that consumed probio-
tic bacteria with plant extracts (PTU-group), the-
re was a significant correlation between the use 
of probiotic with herbal extracts and reducing of 
urinary parameter(P <0.05). In other words, the 
use of herbal extracts with probiotics significantly 
decreased urinary oxalate levels compared to the 
negative control group. As shown in Tables 1-4, 
there was a significant difference in the level of 
urinary and serum parameters after the treatment 
period in rats (P <0.05).
DISCUSSION
	Formation of urinary stones is the third 
most common disease in the genitourinary system, 
it is still considered as a chronic disease and there 
is no definitive treatment to prevent it (26). Up to 
80% of kidney stones are predominantly compo-
sed of calcium oxalate (CaOx). Increasing urinary 
oxalate (hyperoxaluria) is a major risk factor for 
CaOx stone formation 2, 3. This formation of Cal-
cium Oxalate stones is more due to the imbalance 
in the consumption of oxalate-rich foods (such 
as spinach, almonds, cashews, grits, beets), meat 
products, and the lack of expression of a number 
of enzymes necessary for the degradation of food 
oxalate, all of which reduce the risk of calcium 
oxalate kidney stones (2-4). Extraction of stones 
from different parts of the urinary tract requires 
advanced methods, including Extracorporeal Sho-
ck Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL), Transurethral Urete-
ro-Lithotripsy (TUL), and Percutaneous Nephroli-
thotomy (PCNL), but they are very expensive (27, 
28). Sometimes the accumulation of calcium or 
ammonium oxalate crystals in the urinary system 
can cause pelvic inflammation and kidney tissue, 
which is associated with pain and bleeding (29, 
30). Also, the presence of kidney stones leads to 
renal diseases, including renal dysfunction, kid-
ney tissue damage, acute or chronic renal failure, 
all of which can ultimately lead to kidney trans-
plantation (31). The global prevalence of kidney 
stones is between 10% and 15% (32). In Iran, the 
prevalence of calcium oxalate stones is 61.25%, 
and stones with ammonium oxalate and calcium 
phosphate compounds claim 31.25% of cases (32, 
33). Today, studies suggest a direct relationship 
between the recurrence of calcium oxalate stones 
formation and the deficiency of oxalate degrading 
bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. Also, other 
studies, show that taking herbal extracts can help 
to reduce hyperoxaluria in a rat model and reduce 
urinary oxalate excretion in humans (34, 21).
	Our study shows that feeding a mixture 
of probiotic bacteria with herbal extract led to a 
significant reduction of the excretion of oxalate 
in a group of rats with calcium-oxalate urolithia-
sis. However, an important point that supports the 
relevance our results is that no discrepancy was 
observed among those subjects regarding the im-
pact of the experimental therapy on hyperoxalu-
ria. We have shown, using in vitro and in vivo 
models, that certain probiotics offer a therapeutic 
strategy for reducing urinary oxalate excretion. 
Other studies have revealed that Lactobacillus ca-
sei and Lactobacillus plantarum can reduce the 
level of urinary oxalate in patients with kidney 
stones offering a 50% reduction (21). Similarly, 
Guida (2014) examined the effect of a mixture of 
Lactobacilli on urinary oxalate excretion in people 
with intestinal hyperoxaluria, with the results re-
vealing a significant decrease in the urinary oxa-
late level (35). On the other hand, nowadays, with 
the new medical science approaches to herbs, new 
therapeutic ways have been proposed to improve 
various diseases including kidney stones (32, 15). 
The urinary excretion of oxalate indeed was sig-
nificantly reduced by treatment with lactic acid 
bacteria in each of the rat groups  in our study.
	The treatment was associated with a mean 
reduction for in oxaluria, but even this change 
may be biologically important. In fact, only a 
relatively significant difference in urine supersa-
turation appears to exist between stone formers 
and non-stone formers and oxaluria  rather than 
supersaturation has been suggested to be the most 
important variable for stone formation (25, 26). 
An additional point is that we do not exactly know 
what change in urine supersaturation is associated 
with a decrease in stone formation. It is clear fact, 
that even a small change in the absolute urina-

1257
ry excretion of oxalate could lead to substantial 
changes in supersaturation. Since ancient times, 
extracts and medicinal plants have been used as 
traditional treatments for urinary tract diseases 
such as kidney stones (15). In recent years, various 
plant and traditional drugs have been proposed to 
reduce calcium oxalate kidney stones which may 
be helpful in its prevention and treatment (16).
	Hariprasath in 2013 stated that treatment 
with T. terrestris extract can prevent the rise in 
serum and urine levels of urinary markers such 
as BUN, urea, uric acid, and creatinine (14). Also, 
according to a Moradian study in 2017, Urtica 
dioica plant reduced urinary oxalate levels in rats 
with calcium oxalate kidney stones (36). Further, 
the study of Urtica dioica indicated that the plant 
extract at a concentration of 50 and 100mg decre-
ased tissue inflammation.
	The present study is a new approach about 
reducing urinary oxalate level, with concurrent use 
of herbal extracts with probiotic, there were interes-
ting results. The study was conducted over a 30-day 
period. Before the beginning of the study, the groups 
were treated with ethylene glycol (to form calcium 
oxalate crystals in the renal tissue). Subsequently, 
the two main groups were examined, that included 
a group of rats that use herbal extracts alone (T.U-
-Group) and another group that use of herbal extracts 
with probiotic (P.T.U-Group). Initially, it was observed 
that the use of ethylene glycol, increased the level of 
urinary oxalate and the formation of calcium oxalate 
crystals in the kidney tissue, Which led to inflam-
mation and renal defect, kidney malformation, and 
inflammation in other tissues of the rats. However, 
with consumption of plant extracts (without probio-
tic), there was a significant decrease in the level of 
renal inflammation and decrease in the level of uri-
nary parameters (P <0.05). But the time to reduce re-
nal inflammation and urinary oxalate, in this group 
was thirty days. While the use of herbal extracts with 
probiotic bacteria, reduced the inflammation and eli-
minated calcium oxalate crystals in the renal tissue 
in shorter time (20 days). The faster reduction of phy-
siological complications and tissue inflammation can 
be due to the use of probiotics such as plantarium 
(immunosuppressive and inflammatory).
	And second reason, can be due to use of 
two strains L. paracasei AKPL-IR (JF461540.1), L. 
paracasei AKKL-IR (JF461539.1), that, particularly, 
degrade of oxalate in vitro and in vivo, Consequen-
tly, urinary oxalate is reduced faster, which ultima-
tely reduces the complications of the pathobiology 
sooner. They are submitted in NCBI site (as strains 
that have high power in oxalate decomposition).
	Undoubtedly, this can be a new suggestion 
for treatment of kidney stone; however, study on 
the simultaneous use of herbal extracts with oxala-
te degrading probiotics that affect urinary oxalate 
excretion, needs further investigation.
CONCLUSIONS
	In this study, it was observed that at first, 
rats tested with kidney stones with ethylene glycol 
had inappropriate physiological complications, in-
cluding weight loss, skin inflammation and low 
urine output, but at the end of the course, all of the 
pathogenesis rats treated with herbal extracts and 
probiotics appeared to be healthy and well-wei-
ghed. Importantly, rats tolerated the treatment well. 
Use of probiotic food supplement seems highly fea-
sible for preventing absorptive/enteric hyperoxalu-
ria. Future studies should also consider to evaluate 
an effective oxalate degrading symbiotic and plant 
extracts (probiotic+prebiotic+medical plant extract) 
and studying this combination using in vitro and in 
vivo studies.
