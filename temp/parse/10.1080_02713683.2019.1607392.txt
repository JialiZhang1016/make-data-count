ABSTRACT
Purpose/Aim: Many genes have been associated with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Knowing
exactly where they are expressed in the eye helps to unravel POAG pathology and to select optimal
targets for intervention. We investigated whether RNA in situ hybridization (RNA-ISH) is a convenient
technique to obtain detailed pan-ocular expression data of these genes. We tested this for four diverse
candidate POAG genes, selected because of unclear ocular distribution (F5 and Dusp1) and relevance for
potential new therapies (Tnf, Tgfβr3). Optn, a POAG gene with well-known ocular expression pattern
served as control.
Methods: We made a list of candidate glaucoma genes reported in genetic studies. A table of their
ocular expression at the tissue level was compiled using publicly available microarray data (the ocular
tissue database). To add cellular detail we performed RNA-ISH for Optn, Tnf, Tgfβr3, F5, and Dusp1 on
eyes of healthy, 2-month-old, pigmented, and albino mice.
Results: Expression of the Optn control matched with published immunohistochemistry data. Ocular
expression of Tnf was generally low, with patches of higher Tnf expression, superficially in the corneal
epithelium. F5 had a restricted expression pattern with high expression in the nonpigmented ciliary
body epithelium and moderate expression in the peripapillary region. Tgfβr3 and Dusp1 showed
ubiquitous expression.
Conclusions: RNA-ISH is a suitable technique to determine the ocular expression pattern of POAG
genes, adding meaningful cellular detail to existing microarray expression data. For instance, the high
expression of F5 in the nonpigmented ciliary body epithelium suggests a role of this gene in aqueous
humor dynamics and intraocular pressure. In addition, the ubiquitous expression of Tgfβr3 has implica-
tions for designing TGF-β-related glaucoma therapies, with respect to side effects. Creating pan-ocular
expression maps of POAG genes with RNA-ISH will help to identify POAG pathways in specific cell types
and to select targets for drug development.

Introduction
Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness.1,2 The
term glaucoma denotes a group of optic neuropathies, character-
ized by progressive degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGC).3,4
Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common form
of glaucoma.5 Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is an important
risk factor for POAG.6–8 Current treatment modalities of glau-
coma are aimed at lowering the IOP, which can slow down disease
progression. Yet, visual field loss often does not stop, which under-
scores the importance of developing new therapies.
Identification of the genetic causes of POAG can help to
elucidate the pathophysiology and to find new therapeutic
targets. Linkage studies have found several loci in which
gene mutations are responsible for hereditary glaucoma.3,9–12
In addition, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in over
100 genes have been reported to be associated with glaucoma
or relevant quantitative traits like IOP, optic disc area (ODA),
vertical cup disc ratio (VCDR), and central cornea thickness
(CCT).13–16 Despite this wealth of genetic information, it
remains difficult to identify the molecular pathways of
POAG pathophysiology.14,16–20 Partly, this may be due to
the fact that many different tissues are involved in glaucoma,
such as retina, optic nerve, trabecular meshwork (TM), ciliary
body (CB), and cornea. POAG may well be a heterogeneous
disease with multiple pathways acting in the various tissues
involved. For identification of these tissue or cell type-specific
pathways, it would be of great value to know which set of
candidate glaucoma genes is active in each particular cell type,
for example the retinal ganglion cells (RGC). Detailed knowl-
edge of the gene expression pattern is also essential for
designing new therapies. Since genes are often widely
expressed, targeting a gene for glaucoma therapy may well
have side effects in other cells.
High throughput methods have generated ocular expres-
sion data for most genes, but spatial resolution is limited to
the tissue level, as for example in RNA microarray studies that

use whole retina as input.21 For a limited set of genes more
detailed information has been generated by immunohisto-
chemistry (IHC). However, this technique is not applicable
for all genes since antibodies with high specificity and affinity
are not available for all proteins. In addition, secreted proteins
are often difficult to localize with this technique. RNA in situ
hybridization (RNA-ISH) is another method to localize gene
expression at the cellular level. This method has the advantage
that the same probe design and staining protocol can be
employed with similar efficiency for practically all genes.
The method used to be difficult and cumbersome due to
instability of mRNA molecules but recent advances have
made the method more robust and easy to apply.22
The main objective of this study was to investigate whether
RNA-ISH can be used as a convenient, general purpose
method to obtain pan-ocular expression data of candidate
POAG genes. To study this, we first updated the list of
candidate glaucoma genes and created an ocular expression
map using the data of the ocular tissue database (OTDB),
a mRNA microarray study that specifies expression at the
tissue level.23 In order to test RNA-ISH method, we selected
five diverse genes from this list: Optineurin (Optn), tumor
necrosis factor alpha (Tnf), transforming growth factor beta
receptor 3 (Tgfβr3), blood coagulation factor V (F5), and dual
specificity protein phosphatase 1 (Dusp1). Optn, a commonly
referred to POAG gene, was selected as a control to validate
the technique because its expression in the mouse eye has
been well established using immunohistochemistry,24,25 Tnf
and Tgfβr3 were selected because these genes are involved in
pathways that are currently being targeted in new experimen-
tal POAG therapies and knowledge of the ocular expression of
these genes is vital to predict potential side effects.17,18,26 In
addition, the expression of TNF-α being a secreted protein has
been difficult to pinpoint using immunohistochemistry. F5
and Dusp1 were selected since little is known about their
expression in the eye. F5 protein has been detected in aqueous
humor (AH) but origin and ocular function is unclear.27–30
While Dusp1 has been demonstrated in the retina, it also is
a target of miRNA hsa-mir-3185 that has been found upre-
gulated in AH of glaucoma patients.31,32 A possible role of
DUSP1 in the anterior segment during POAG is yet
unknown.
Here, we showed that RNA-ISH is a suitable and conve-
nient technique to provide detailed pan-ocular expression
maps for these diverse genes.
Methods
Gene list
From October 2015 till February 2019, a literature search was
conducted on PubMed and Embase using the MeSH terms
“glaucoma, open-angle” combined with either “risk” AND
“genes” or with “genetics” or with “polymorphism, single
nucleotide.” A similar search was additionally performed for
the glaucoma-associated endophenotypes “intraocular pres-
sure” or “cornea” or “optic disc” combined with “risk” AND
“genes” or “genetics” or “polymorphism, single nucleotide.”
The scope of the paper was on the genetic background of
POAG, as such only studies investigating genetic polymorph-
isms and mutations were eligible. Expression studies or ani-
mal studies were excluded. If a gene was reported, further
PubMED and Embase searches were conducted to find repli-
cation studies for this particular candidate gene. Additional
literature was handpicked by tracking the references of these
papers (“snowballing”). We slightly modified Janssen et al.’s -
criteria,14 and subdivided glaucoma candidate genes into three
groups.
(1) Familial glaucoma associated loci/gene: Loci or genes
segregating in glaucoma families and identified in
linkage studies.
(2) Highly likely candidate POAG genes: Genes reported
to have an association with glaucoma based on
a meta-analysis of at least three independent case
control studies. Genes reported in at least one
GWAS with validation in an independent replication
cohort.
(3) Less likely candidate POAG risk genes: Reported only
once or twice in case-control studies.
Ocular tissue database (OTDB)
We downloaded the rough gene expression data from the
OTDB
(https://genome.uiowa.edu/otdb/).23
This
database
contains microarray expression data of microscopically dis-
sected post-mortem human eye tissues. The array was ana-
lyzed using the Affymetrix Probe Logarithmic Intensity Error
Estimation (PLIER) package to obtain PLIER values for each
gene. We downloaded these files and calculated per tissue the
PLIER value corresponding to the 90th percentile, 50th per-
centile, and 10th percentile. Based on their expression per-
centile range each gene was given a color as indicated in
supplemental Table 1.
RNA in situ hybridization
Animals were obtained and treated in strict accordance with
the recommendation in the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals under Dutch law. Experiments were
approved by the Dutch animal experiments committee. At 8
weeks of age, six pigmented C57BL/6 mice (Charles River)
and four C57BL/6 albino mice (C57BL/6BrdCrHsd-Tyrc;
Envigo) were anesthetized using CO2 and humanely killed
by cervical dislocation. Eyes were taken out and fixed in
10% neutral buffered formalin (Fisher Scientific, Landsmeer,
the Netherlands) for at least 24 h at 4°C prior to paraffin
embedding. RNA-ISH was carried out using RNAscope®
Technology (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Milan, Italy) with
the RNAscope® 2.5 HD Assay -RED (#322350) according the
manufacturer’s instructions with probes targeting mouse Tnf
(#311081), Tgfβr3 (#406221), Dusp1 (#424501), and F5 (cus-
tom designed for base pair region 319–1257). A probe target-
ing

as
control.
As
per
manufacturer’s recommendation, each experiment was addi-
tionally performed together with a positive (Polr2a; #312471)
and negative control probe (DapB; #310043). Briefly, 5 μm

were placed on glass slides (SuperFrost Plus) and baked (1 h,

nol, boiled in target retrieval buffer (10 min) and protease
treated (15–30 min, 40°C). Next, sections were hybridized
with target probes (2 h, 40°C), followed by signal amplifica-
tion steps and alkaline phosphatase labeling. Sections were
treated with chromogenic Fast-Red substrate (10 min), coun-
terstained with 50% Gill’s Hematoxylin-1 (Sigma-Aldrich,
Zwijndrecht,

and
mounted
using
Ecomount (Klinipath, Breda, the Netherlands). Expression
levels were semiquantitatively scored based on the criteria
described in supplemental Table 1. For scoring we skimmed
through the whole section. Detailed information on the
amount of sections scored per gene and per animal is pro-
vided in supplemental Table 1. The expression scores of the
pigmented
and
albino
animals
were
compared
using
a standard two-sided t-test. To generate the final heat map,
scores of pigmented and albino groups were combined and
the total average was rounded to the nearest score. Per tissue
a representative section was imaged under a bright-field
microscope (BX51, Olympus, Zoeterwoude, the Netherlands)
fitted with a digital camera (SC-30 Olympus).
Results
Update of glaucoma gene list
Our literature search yielded SNPs or mutations in 263 genes
associated with POAG or its endophenotypes. Based on our
criteria, adapted from Janssen et al. (see methods),14 we
classified them: 11 Genes were classified as familial glaucoma
associated genes based on 20 loci reported in linkage studies
(supplemental Table 2); 147 genes were reported in multiple
studies and therefore classified as highly likely candidate
glaucoma genes (supplemental Table 3). The remaining 106
genes were classified as less likely candidate glaucoma genes
(supplemental Table 4).
Ocular expression map
We then created a map of the expression of these genes in the
eye using the data of the ocular tissue database (OTDB),
a mRNA microarray study that specifies expression at the
tissue level.23 The ocular expression data of the familial glau-
coma associated genes are shown in Figure 1. For the highly
and less likely candidate glaucoma risk genes, expression data
are presented in Figures 2–3, respectively. Some SNPs are
situated in between genes and it is difficult to establish
which gene is affected by the SNP. For these SNPs, we took
the gene expression of both genes in the vicinity of the SNP
(these genes are highlighted in pink in the figures. Of eight
highly likely (ADAMTS18, ARID5B, AVGR8, DIRC3, ENO4,
NUDT7, PRR31, and U6) and seven less likely (DCLK3,
GPDS1, THSD7A, RFPL4Bm mt-CYB, mt-CO1, and mt-ND2)
candidate glaucoma genes we did not find expression levels in
the OTDB. Seven SNPs were located in or near microRNA
encoding transcripts (MIR548F3, MIR606, MIR3196, and
MIR4707)
or
noncoding
RNA
transcripts
(BASP1P1,
LINC01734, and LINC00583) which were not measured on
the microarray used in the OTDB study.
RNA in situ hybridization
RNA-ISH produced distinct and detailed ocular expression
maps of the five genes investigated. Using albino mice we
could confirm our findings and add expression data of tissues
normally pigmented. The expression of the nonpigmented
tissues was not significantly different between the two animal
groups (for every tissue p > 0.05 (supplemental Table 1).
There was no noticeable difference between the different
experiments as assessed by the positive and negative control
probes Polr2a and DapB. Polr2a is ubiquitously expressed
with a high expression whereas no signal was observed
when staining for the bacterial gene DapB (supplemental
Figure 1).
Optn
Optn was more strongly expressed in the posterior segment of
the eye. Each of the retinal layers had a high expression
(Figure 4e). In the area of the optic nerve head (ONH) cells
Optn expression was low (Figure 4d). Both the pigmented and
the nonpigmented CB epithelia (CBE) had a high expression
(Figure 4b). Cornea epithelium had a low to moderate expres-
sion (Figure 4a). TM (Figure 4c) expressed Optn to a lower
extent.
Tnf
Tnf had a very low expression in the healthy mouse eye. The
most intense staining was found in the corneal epithelium.
Here, a variable staining was found in the most superficial
layer. Some patches of relatively high expression were noticed,
while other areas lacked staining (Figure 5a). Apart from this,

a very low expression was present in the inner nuclear layer
(INL) and outer nuclear layer (ONL) of the retina (Figure 8a).
All other tissues showed no expression.
Tgfβr3
In general, Tgfβr3 was ubiquitously expressed with more abundant
expression in the anterior segment than the posterior segment.
High Tgfβr3 expression was found in the cornea, in epithelium,
stroma as well as endothelium (Figure 5b). In the epithelium,
expression was localized mainly in the basal layer. Both the pig-
mented and the nonpigmented (CBE) had a very high expression
(Figure 6b). Tgfβr3 also had a high expression in the TM (Figure
7b). In the retina,expression differed between thevarious celltypes
(Figure 8b). Highest expression was seen in the INL and the retinal
pigment epithelium (RPE). A moderate expression was observed
in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and in the glial lamina of the ONH
(Figure 9b). The ONLhadalmost no expression and no Tgfβr3 was
found in the inner segments of the photoreceptors (Figure 8b).
F5
F5 had a remarkable expression pattern, largely restricted to
two regions: First, a high expression was found in the non-
pigmented CBE, while the pigmented CBE had no F5 expres-
sion (Figure 6c). Second, a moderate expression was observed
in the peripapillary region, surrounding the ONH (Figure 9c).
In addition, a very low expression was seen in the corneal
epithelium (Figure 5c) and in the INL and ONL of the retina
(Figure 8c). F5 expression was absent in the TM (Figure 7c).
Dusp1
Dusp1 had a ubiquitous expression in the eye. The intensity was
lower than that observed for Tgfβr3. In the anterior section of the
eye a strong, but patchy, irregular signal was observed in the
corneal epithelium (Figure 5d). A moderate expression was
observed in stroma and endothelium. Additionally, Dusp1 was
moderately expressed in the CB and the TM (Figures 6d–7d). In
the posterior segment, Dusp1 was highly expressed in several

tissues including the GCL, INL, and ONH (Figure 8d). The optic
nerve shows high expression in the glial cells of the glial lamina

photoreceptor inner segments (Figure 8d).

Comparison of RNA-ISH data with OTDB
In Figure 10, we summarized and compared our semiquanti-
tative RNA-ISH expression data with the heat map created on
the basis of the expression data of the OTDB. As can be
expected, RNA-ISH showed that gene expression often dif-
fered between the different cell types in a tissue. For instance,
patches of Tnf activity were concentrated in the corneal

epithelium and not found in corneal stroma and endothelium.
Expression of Tgfβr3 greatly varied between the different
retinal layers and no activity was observed in the inner seg-
ments of the photoreceptors. High F5 activity was localized in
the nonpigmented CBE, whereas no F5 expression was seen in
the pigmented CBE. Clearly, RNA-ISH provided more
detailed localization data as compared to the microarray
data of the OTDB, which give an average expression level
for the whole tissue.
Discussion
In the present study, we evaluated whether RNA-ISH is
a suitable, general purpose method to generate pan-ocular
expression maps of POAG genes. These maps can help to
better unravel POAG pathophysiology and to select optimal
targets for therapy. We tested this using Optn, as a control
gene, being a POAG gene with known ocular expression
pattern in the mouse eye and four candidate POAG genes
(Tnf, Tgfβr3, F5, and Dusp1). RNA-ISH provided distinct,
detailed expression maps for all these genes unveiling new
cellular localizations.
In order to obtain an overview of the localization of
glaucoma gene expression, we first updated the list of can-
didate glaucoma genes. The updated list contains 263 genes
of which 147 have been implicated in multiple studies or
separate cohorts. Based on the gene expression data of the
OTDB,23 we then created an ocular expression heat map of
these genes. To our knowledge, this is the first time that an
ocular expression map is provided for a large number of
POAG genes. While this expression map certainly contains
a lot of information, it also has limitations: It reflects the
situation in healthy, adult tissue, which may well differ from
the expression pattern in development or disease. Another
limitation is that the expression is provided at the tissue level
and not at the cellular level. Retinal expression for example
does not necessarily mean that a particular gene is expressed
in RGCs, the cells that are most affected in glaucoma. In the
present study, we addressed this last limitation by testing
whether RNA-ISH is a convenient method to add the lacking
cellular expression details.
In comparison to IHC, RNA-ISH has several advantages
and disadvantages. Clearly, the site of mRNA expression
does not correspond to the site of the protein, nor does
RNA-ISH labeling intensity necessarily reflect the amount
of the encoded protein.33 With IHC it may be difficult to
identify the site of production of proteins that are secreted,
and it is not possible to study expression of nonprotein-
coding genes. As some of the POAG-associated SNPs are
located in microRNA and noncoding RNA, IHC would not
be able to obtain pan-ocular expression of them. Another
downside of IHC is the generation of specific antibodies
can be tedious design,34 while production of specific probes
for RNA-ISH is straightforward and highly comparable for
all genes. In addition, while RNA-ISH in the past was
difficult due to rapid mRNA decay, procedures have
improved.34–36 Judging from the staining of the technical
controls (positive and negative) and the biological control
(Optn, see below), RNA-ISH provided reliable expression
patterns. Of course, in our study we used optimally pre-
pared animal tissue. RNA-ISH on human post-mortem
tissue will be more challenging.

Localization of Optn expression
The ocular expression of Optn, a well-known causative POAG
gene, has been thoroughly investigated, which makes this gene
a suitable control to compare and validate our technique.
Immunohistochemistry has shown that in healthy mice Optn
is expressed in the cornea (cornea epithelium and stroma),
CB, iris, TM, and several layers of the retina.24,25 With RNA-
ISH we clearly demonstrated expression in all these cell types
and could successfully validate the technique. The most
intense labeling of Optn was in the retina, including RGCs,
which fits well with the role of Optn in normal tension
glaucoma.37
Localization of TNF expression
TNF signaling has been implicated in glaucoma pathophysiology
and studies report an increase of TNF-α in glaucomatous aqueous
humor (AH).38,39 As TNF-α is a secreted protein, the origin of
increased TNF expression is difficult to assess with antibodies. In
addition, TNF-α is a target for development of new, neuroprotec-
tive glaucoma therapy.40,41 Precise localization of endogenous
expression and secretion are relevant for the development of TNF-
related therapy.
In general, we found a very low expression of Tnf in
healthy mouse eyes. In contrast to our findings, the OTDB
described a moderate expression in almost all eye tissues.

Since aging is associated with an increase in TNF-α, the
higher expression levels in the OTDB may relate to the

age
of
human
donor
eyes.42
Specifically,
we observed expression in the GCL and INL, which may
correspond to known expression in Müller cells.43 Most strik-
ing was our finding of a patchy expression of Tnf in super-
ficial layers of the corneal epithelium, without expression in
other corneal layers. To our knowledge, this specific pattern

approximately 10 pg/ml TNF-α in healthy cornea.44 Our
data suggest that this TNF-α is produced by superficial cells
of the corneal epithelium. It is not known whether corneal
TNF-α plays a role in glaucoma, but is certainly worth inves-
tigating as it may be relevant for (side-) effects of TNF-
targeted therapy. Additionally, TNF-α could diffuse to the
tears where it can be measured as a potential biomarker. In
fact, TNF-α has been measured in tears of POAG patients and
control subjects, but results were ambiguous.45,46

Localization of TGFβR3 expression
The TGF-β signaling pathway is often reported in relation to
glaucoma, e.g. reviewed by Fuchshofer and Tamm.47 Recently,
it became a target for drug development for glaucoma as well
as for fibrosis after eye surgery.48–50
We found a relatively high, ubiquitous expression of
Tgfβr3, which underscores the importance of this pathway in
the eye. These findings agree with those of a RT-PCR study,51
as well as the microarray study of the OTDB in human eyes.23
One study localized TGFβR3 in the cornea using immunohis-
tochemistry; the authors noted in their discussion that the
results were difficult to replicate due to varying staining
intensities.52 With RNA-ISH, we clearly observed expression
in all corneal layers. The OTDB reports a low overall expres-
sion of Tgfβr3 in the retina. Our RNA-ISH data are more
specific and show amongst others, a moderate expression in
the GCL. We confirmed expression of Tgfβr3 in the TM. This
is relevant for glaucoma since in POAG increased levels of its
ligand TGF-β2 occur in the AH.47,53 Finally, the ubiquitous
expression of Tgfβr3 in the eye, particularly in the anterior
segment, suggests that new TGF-β-related glaucoma drugs
targeting this receptor may have widespread (side-)effects.
Localization of F5 expression
SNPs in and near the F5 gene are associated with an increase
in ODA and VCDR.17,18 Yet, not much is known regarding
the expression in the eye. In our study, F5 showed a very
distinct expression pattern with a high expression in two
specific areas and hardly any staining in other tissues. High
expression was found in the nonpigmented CBE. The OTDB
showed a very high expression in the CB but was not able to
discriminate between pigmented and nonpigmented CBE.
Secondly, F5 was expressed in the peripapillary region.
A study using RNA sequencing found a high expression of
F5 in TM and CB and a low expression in the cornea.54
Another study using microarray analysis of ex vivo corneoscl-
eral specimens, found that F5 was significantly higher
expressed in the TM than in cornea and sclera.55 Clearly,
these studies, as well as the OTDB, reported F5 expression
in the TM, whereas we did not observe staining in this tissue.
While it is possible that there is a difference between F5
expression in mouse and human tissue, an alternative expla-
nation may be that the high levels of F5 in the CB have led to
F5 mRNA contamination of the TM in these ex vivo samples.
The high expression in the CBE with virtually no expres-
sion in any other anterior segment tissue suggests that F5 in
AH, is actively secreted from the CB into the AH When
comparing the AH concentration of F5 between POAG
patients
and
other
ocular
disease
the
results
are
inconclusive.27–30 Unfortunately, F5 SNPs were not deter-
mined in these studies. It would be interesting to investigate
if there is a correlation between F5 polymorphisms and F5
concentration in the AH. In addition to changes in the AH,
the expression of F5 in the border area of the ONH might
affect ODA directly. Both these findings are interesting topics
for further study.
Localization of Dusp1 expression
Polymorphisms in the Dusp1 gene are associated with an
increase in the cup area and VCDR.18,26 Data on ocular
Dusp1 expression are scarce and only one study investigated
its function in the eye.32 This study of the retina reported
expression of Dusp1 in RGC, bipolar cells, amacrine cells,
horizontal cells, and Müller cells. The study showed that
Dusp1 played a role in RGC survival during ischemic condi-
tions induced by elevated IOP, suggesting that expression of
Dusp1 in the GCL may be relevant for glaucoma.
Our results showed that Dusp1 is ubiquitously expressed in
the eye, which is overall in agreement with the, albeit less
specific, microarray data of the OTDB. We localized Dusp1
mRNA in all retinal layers. In contrast to the above-
mentioned retinal study, we also found expression in photo-
receptors. A microarray expression study reported expression
of Dusp1 in the corneal epithelium.56 We confirmed this
expression and showed that the strongest expression was
observed in the superficial epithelium cells. Lastly, we showed
that Dusp1 is also expressed in CB and TM. This implies that
the previously reported hsa-mir-3185 can target Dusp1 in the
TM.31 Future studies can investigate if Dusp1 is downregu-
lated in TM of glaucoma patients as a result of has-mir-3185
expression.
To conclude, we conveniently visualized publically avail-
able ocular expression data of glaucoma risk genes in a heat
map. In this map, expression is localized at the tissue level.
Using four candidate glaucoma genes (Tnf, Tgfβr3, F5, and
Dusp1) and one causative POAG gene (Optn) as examples, we
showed that RNA-ISH is an efficient, straightforward method
to add cellular detail to these expression data. Future studies
can utilize this technique in healthy and glaucoma tissues to
create more detailed expression maps of glaucoma genes. This
will facilitate identification of the specific molecular pathways
that act in the various cell types, causing the pathology of
glaucoma. In addition, it will help to identify the most pro-
mising targets for drug development, also accounting for side
effects.
