Introduction
Aziridines have been established as interesting building blocks
for a variety of (asymmetric) transformations and their synthetic
versatility can be attributed to the fact that they easily undergo
ring opening reactions with a variety of different nucleo-
philes.[1] In addition, a broad variety of (chiral) aziridines can be
accessed straightforwardly (racemic or enantiopure) by estab-
lished synthesis strategies starting from simple precursors,[1,2]
making approaches relying on aziridine opening reactions very
appealing. The reactions of aziridines with C-nucleophiles, i.e.
enolate species, can lead to interesting γ-amino-carbonyl tar-
gets which are not easily accessible by other strategies. In addi-
tion, depending on the aziridine substitution pattern, rather
complex structural motives containing two or even three con-
secutive stereogenic centers can be accessed (Scheme 1A) and
the use of a chiral catalyst may allow to control such reactions
in a stereoselective manner.[1,3–6]
Our group has a strong interest in asymmetric ion pairing
catalysis[7–10]
and

bifunctional
ammonium salt catalysts[8] containing a (thio)-urea H-bonding
motive (i.e. catalysts A) can be used for the asymmetric α-
hydroxylation of -keto esters 1 by using racemic oxaziridines
2 as the O-transfer reagents (accompanied by a simultaneous
resolution of the oxaziridines 2 as outlined in Scheme 1B).[10]
Based on the general interest in aziridine-opening reactions
and given our focus on asymmetric ammonium salt catalysis

genic centers and can be rendered enantioselective (up to e.r. =

we now wanted to explore if ammonium salt catalysts (like
compounds A) may also facilitate the addition of pronucleo-
philes 1 to aryl-aziridines 4. In general, the asymmetric ring-
opening of aziridines with -keto esters 1 using chiral ammon-
ium salt catalysts has been well-investigated, i.e. by the groups
of Dixon and Jørgenson.[4] However, in those cases no aryl-azir-
idines 4 were used and to the best of our knowledge there are
only very few reports in general, where enolate precursors were
added to such aziridines in an asymmetric manner.[5] Interest-
ingly, some previous reports describing the addition of
malonates to such aziridines in the absence of a chiral catalyst
showed that these reagents predominately undergo nucleo-
phile addition to the benzylic position of the aziridine, and that
these reactions proceed via a stereospecific ring-opening path-
way with inversion of configuration of the benzylic stereogenic
center.[6] We thus wondered if we could introduce a protocol

for the regio- and stereoselective addition of pronucleophiles 1
to (racemic) aziridines 4, which would result in the formation
of the highly functionalized target molecules 5 (Scheme 1C).
Results and Discussion
We started our investigations by carrying out the reaction be-
tween the tert-butyl ester 1a and the phenyl aziridine 4a. The
reason why we opted for the N-tosyl protected 4a was because
we previously (during the hydroxylation of 1 with oxaziridines
2) realized that sulfonamide groups provide a very good point
of coordination for our bifunctional ammonium salts A.[10] Be-
sides our own catalysts A[10,11] (on which we put our main fo-
cus), we also compared the other classical and well-established
ammonium salt catalysts B[7,12] and C[7,13] and the recently re-
ported bifunctional Cinchona alkaloid derivative D.[14]
First experiments without any catalyst (entry 1) and in the
presence of a simple achiral ammonium salt (entry 2) clearly
proved the beneficial effect of the phase-transfer catalyst and
showed that the reaction proceeds via addition to the benzylic
carbon of the aziridine (giving 5a). The relative configuration of
the major diastereomer of product 5a was assigned by single-
crystal X-ray analysis[15] and in all further experiments the unlike
diastereomer was found to be the main product. We then carried
out a first base screening with our urea-containing catalyst A1
(entries 3–6) and found that the targeted product 5a could be
obtained in a reasonable yield of 79 % and with promising enan-
tio- and diastereoselectivities (d.r. = 6:1; e.r. = 89:11) after 24 h
when using two equivalents of solid Cs2CO3 (entry 6). The use of
aqueous bases on the other hand significantly slowed down the
conversion (entry 4) and stronger bases (e.g. NaOH) were found
to be not suited at all (results not given in the table), i.e. as
the aziridine decomposed significantly under these conditions.
Interestingly, while the major diastereomer could be obtained
with a good enantiomeric ratio of 89:11, the minor diastereomer
was formed in an almost racemic manner (entry 6).
We then tested other derivatives of the bifunctional ammon-
ium salts A (entries 7–9 give three representative examples),
but neither the use of a thiourea (entry 7), nor using sterically
more bulky systems (entry 9) resulted in any improvement.
When using the well-established Maruoka catalyst B next (entry
10),[7,12] the reaction stalled after around 50 % conversion and
the observed diastereoselectivity was rather low (d.r. = 1.5:1). In
sharp contrast to ammonium salt A1 however, catalyst B al-
lowed for higher enantioselectivities of the minor diastereomer
(favoring the same major enantiomers of both diastereomers as
A1). The classical Cinchona alkaloid ammonium salts C were
found to be less suited for this reaction (entries 11 and 12),
while the bifunctional catalyst D[14] gave at least some levels
of selectivity (entry 13), although clearly not as promising as
compounds A.
Based on these results, which support a beneficial effect of
the bifunctional nature of the catalyst, we then tried to further
optimize the reaction conditions using A1 (entries 14–18).
While non-aromatic solvents were found to be less suited (en-
tries 14, 15), the use of a lower amount of base resulted in a
slightly increased enantioselectivity of 91:9 (compare entries 16

and 6). However, the yield was noticeable lower, and we found
that actually this reaction stalled after around 60 % conversion,
requiring addition of more base to proceed to completion.
When carrying out the reaction under more concentrated con-
ditions, the yield improved slightly, while the enantioselectivity
decreased (entry 17). This result is in line with our recent obser-
vations for the α-hydroxylation of compounds 1, where higher
dilution was beneficial for high enantioselectivities as well.[10]
Finally, lowering the catalyst loading to 5 mol-% resulted in a
slightly lower selectivity but in a noteworthy reduced yield.
Again, the reaction stalled after a while and addition of more
catalyst was necessary in those cases, while longer reaction
times were not beneficial. This phenomenon was generally ob-
served in all the other reactions that did not show a satisfying
conversion after 24 h (compare with entries 4, 10, and 16).
Lower temperatures were tried as well but the reactions be-
came very slow with unreliable conversions and no benefit in
enantioselectivity.
Unfortunately, during these optimization attempts we ob-
served a very strong influence of the starting material quality
on the stereoselectivity of the reaction. First, the aziridine 4 has
to be rather clean and especially even very minor quantities of
iodine residues originating from the synthesis route[16] lead to
a significant decrease of the e.r. In addition, the used -keto
ester 1 has to be “perfectly clean” as well, as we observed that
batches of 1a that contained very small quantities of unidenti-
fied impurities (less than 1 % by 1H NMR) resulted in reduced
enantioselectivities down to e.r. = 75:25 under otherwise identi-
cal conditions (in addition the yields were a bit higher here,
demonstrating the notable influence of these unknown impuri-
ties on the reaction performance). Thus, use tests of each batch
of the starting materials had to be made during all these opti-
mizations. In sharp contrast to this pronounced sensitivity on
the starting material quality observed for the synthesis of 5,
use tests of different keto ester 1a batches for other reactions
catalyzed by catalysts A (like the above mentioned α-hydroxyl-
ation[10] or analogous α-halogenations[17]) revealed no measur-
able dependency of selectivity and/or yield therein. Accord-
ingly, this rather unpractical sensitivity, where seemingly small
impurities or changes in the reagent's quality affected the out-
come significantly, required a tedious purification of the start-
ing materials for all asymmetric experiments. As a consequence,
the results given in entries 6 and 16 in Table 1 are the best we
could obtain with carefully purified reagents only. On the other
hand, it should be noted that with given qualities of a single
batch of 1a and/or 4a reproducible results were obtained when
repeating the experiments several times.
During our A1-catalyzed α-hydroxylation of 1 with oxazir-
idines 2 we also observed a practical simultaneous kinetic reso-
lution of compounds 2 (up to s = 45)[10] and we therefore spec-
ulated that a resolution may be possible for our herein used
aziridine 4a too. We thus carried out the addition of 1a to rac-
4a (2 equiv.) under the optimized conditions (entry 16, Table 1)
and observed some moderate enantioenrichment of recovered
4a as well [e.r. = 60:40 for (S)-4a after 25 % conversion; s = 4.8].
Giving the significantly lower stereoselectivity in the synthesis
of 5a compared to our previous synthesis of 3, this lower effi-

ciency for the simultaneous resolution of 4a comes as no sur-
prise, but nevertheless this result supports our initial hypothe-
sis.
To gather further information about this aziridine-opening
reaction, we next carried out the addition of 1a to enantiopure
(R)-4a[18] in the presence of either (R,R)-A1 or (S,S)-A1 as a cata-
lyst (Scheme 2).
In both cases, the two diastereomers of 5a were formed with
complete enantiospecifity, supporting an SN2-mechansim for
the ring opening, as observed by others as well.[6] The use of
the (R,R)-catalyst enantiomer (which was also used during the
screening summarized in Table 1) lead to a reasonable dia-
stereoselectivity of 6:1 in favor of the major unlike diastereomer

with high yield (match case). On the other hand, the reaction
with the (S,S)-catalyst proceeded significantly slower and with
much lower diastereoselectivity (mismatch case). In our previ-
ous investigations on the use of catalysts A for reactions of
-keto esters 1 we observed that the (S,S)-catalyst enantiomers
always favor Re-face addition of the nucleophile.[10,17] In addi-
tion, previous DFT calculations of the A1-catalyzed α-hydroxyl-
ation of 1a with 2 support a transition state where the enolate
is H-bonded to the urea moiety, while the electrophile is coordi-
nated to the ammonium group.[10,19] Based on these previous
observations, the herein observed pronounced match/mis-
match behavior in the stereospecific addition to enantiopure
aziridine 4a, and the unambiguously determined relative con-
figuration of 4a,[15] the (R,R)-catalyst is supposed to interact
with both starting materials 1a and 4a in an organized bifunc-
tional manner as illustrated in Scheme 2, rationalizing formation
of the observed favored major stereoisomer (S,R)-5a. Based on
this model it can also be proposed that the slightly preferred
enantiomer of the minor like diastereomer is (S,S)-5a.
Summing these investigations up, it was demonstrated that
the stereoselective addition of pronucleophile 1a to aziridine
4a can be controlled by using the bifunctional ammonium salts
A. Unfortunately however, because of the unexpected pro-
nounced sensitivity that we observed during all these test reac-
tions, and despite the promising selectivities up to e.r. = 91:9,
this reaction as such is far from being as robust and practical
as other chiral ammonium salt catalyzed reactions that we in-
vestigated recently.[9,10,17]
Considering the novelty of the products 5 that are accessible
by this strategy in general, but keeping in mind the practical
limitations of the asymmetric protocol, i.e. the sensitivity to the
starting material qualities, we thus investigated the application

scope for the racemic phase transfer-catalyzed addition of vari-
ous -keto esters 1 to aryl-aziridines 4 only.
As shown in Scheme 3, a variety of differently functionalized
pronucleophiles 1 and acceptors 4 were reacted for three days
in the presence of benzyltriethylammonium chloride (TEBAC)
using Cs2CO3 (a) or K3PO4 (b) as the base. Interestingly, mesyl-
ated aziridines did not react well (see the result given for prod-
uct 5b) and when using N-Boc aziridines no reaction was ob-
served at all. On the other hand, the use of methyl or benzyl
esters revealed a strong influence of this group on the overall
outcome, as both of them resulted in the direct formation of
the spirocyclic γ-lactam 6 upon addition to aziridine 4a. Differ-
ent substituents on the donor side were tolerated (see products
5e–i), although in some of these cases the use of K3PO4 was
found to be beneficial over Cs2CO3 (in the latter case significant
amounts of decomposition products were observed). On the
other hand, variations of the acceptor aryl group were generally
well accepted in the 4-position, independent of the nature of
the base, while the 3-position was lower yielding (see product
55) and in this case again significant amounts of unidentified
decomposition products were formed. Nevertheless, the race-
mic protocol generally gives access to a variety of differently
functionalized products 5 with relatively good yields and rea-
sonable diastereoselectivities under these operationally simple
ammonium salt-catalyzed conditions.

opening of aryl-aziridines 4 with -keto esters 1.
Conclusions
Summing these investigations up, we have shown that -keto
esters 1 react with aryl-aziridines 4 under (chiral) ammonium
salt catalysis giving access to highly functionalized products 5.
In principle a catalytic and reasonably enantioselective protocol
could be developed by using the bifunctional ammonium salt
catalysts A. Unfortunately, however, this reaction was found to
be very sensitive towards the quality of the starting materials.

Experimental Section
General experimental and analytical details as well as the character-
ization data of all the novel compounds can be found in the online
supporting information.
Racemic Protocol: A mixture of 0.1 mmol -keto ester 1 (1 equiv.),
2.2 mg of TEBAC (0.01 mmol, 10 mol-%) and 0.2 mmol base
(2 equiv.) was dissolved in 5 mL of toluene (Ar-atmosphere). Then
0.2 mmol of aziridine 4 (2 equiv.) were added in one portion. After
a reaction time of three days the mixture was filtered through a
plug of Na2SO4 and washed with DCM. The crude product, obtained
after evaporation of the solvent, was subjected to column chroma-
tography (silica gel, heptanes:EtOAc = 5:1) to isolate products 5 and
6 as mixtures of diastereomers. The diastereomers were in some
cases separated using preparative HPLC (Grace Alltima Silica 10 μm
250 × 10 mm, n-hexane/EtOAc, 5 mL/min).
Enantioselective Screening Protocol: A mixture of the -keto es-
ter 1a (0.1 mmol, 1 equiv.), catalyst A1 (7.6 mg, 0.01 mmol, 10 mol-
%) and 0.2 mmol of the tested base (2 equiv.) were dissolved in 5
mL of the given solvent (argon atmosphere, room temperature).
Then 48 mg of 2-phenyltosylaziridine 4a (0.2 mmol, 2 equiv.) were
added in one portion. After a reaction time of one day the mixture
was filtered through a plug of Na2SO4 and washed with DCM. The
crude product, obtained after evaporation of the solvent under re-
duced pressure, was then subjected to column chromatography pu-
rification (silica gel, heptanes:EtOAc = 2:1) to isolate product 5a as
a mixture of two diastereomers (d.r. up to 8:1) in yields up to 84 %.
The diastereomers were separated using preparative HPLC (Grace
Alltima Silica 10 μm 250 × 10 mm, n-hexane/EtOAc = 9:1, 5 mL/min,
retention times: 39.1 min major, 46.8 min minor). The enantiomeric
excess of the minor diastereomer was determined by HPLC using a
YMC Amylose SA column (n-hexane/iPrOH = 3:1, 1 mL/min, 10 °C,
retention times: 21.0 and 35.5 min). The enantiomeric excess of the
major diastereomer was determined by HPLC using a YMC Cellulose
SB column (n-hexane/iPrOH = 10:1, 1 mL/min, 10 °C, retention
times: 22.2 min major, 20.2 min minor).
