Factors related to the economic performance
of wheat commercial fields1
The variability of agronomic performance and of input use level of wheat commercial fields allows the identification
of the factors with the greatest contribution to its economic performance. The objective of this work was to identify the
main factors related to the variability of economic performance in wheat commercial fields in the Southern Region of
Paraná State. The study was based on data from 65, 64 and 80 farms in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. The variables
evaluated were: costs of fertilizer, herbicide, insecticide, fungicide and seed; grain yield; and simplified gross margin
(SGM). Data were subjected to Principal Components Analysis followed by Cluster Analysis. The variability of wheat
economic performance was mainly related to grain yield, fertilizers cost and seed costs. Grain yield is one of the most
important factors to determination of economic performance of wheat commercial fields in the studied region, and a
greater investment in fertilizers and with seeds can decrease it. It must be considered that the cost reduction might be
obtained with suitable management practices, and the contribution of items of cost analyzed to economic performance
may be different in each cropping season probably due to variations of the cost profile and grain yield.

INTRODUCTION
Wheat is the main winter crop in Southern Brazil with
1,7 million hectares planted, and the State of Paraná is the
main wheat producer, responsible for about 50% of Brazilian
production in the last decade (Conab, 2017). Wheat can
compose different crop systems in this region, but the
succession with soybean is the most important of them
(Pires et al., 2016). Wheat cultivation has many technical
and economic advantages for cropping systems as it
provides a rational and efficient use of soil, resulting in
less soil erosion (Canziani & Guimarães, 2009), summer
crop weed control (Nichols et al., 2015), and a strategy to
reduce farm operating costs (Baumgratz et al., 2017).
Regardless these advantages, in the last decade the
wheat cultivated area in the South region varied from one
year to another between an increase of 19% and decrease
of 18% (Conab, 2017). The inherent risk for wheat farming
is one cause of these variations, which is mainly related to
oscillations of price and grain yield (Pereira et al., 2007).
Excluding the price factor, the climatic conditions are one
of the most important elements for wheat economic return,
since they can significantly affect grain yield and influence
costs and, consequently, determine the farmer’s economic
revenue. Besides, it can affect wheat technological quality
and impact on the grain price (Wilson et al., 2018). This
factor, linked with the high cost of inputs, places Brazil
among the countries with the highest wheat production
expenditure. In addition, wheat cultivation is unattractive
because of the unsatisfactory insurance instruments,
decapitalization or low investment capability, and unstable
market (De Mori & Ignaczak, 2011).
Due to this high-risk scenario, the economic return of
wheat farming depends on the management crop planning
in order to reduce costs and ensure grain yield (Baumgratz

Vladirene Macedo Vieira et al.
Rev. Ceres, Viçosa, v. 66, n.5, p. 333-340, sep/oct, 2019
et al., 2017).  Few studies about this topic show that is
possible to combine these conditions by adjusting inputs
use level and management practices. The best economic
performance has been obtained by farmers throughout an
intermediate use of inputs (Nave et al., 2013). Furthermore,
sowing date and cultivar selection are important strategies
to maximize an economic gain, and a pesticide reduction
could be possible without reducing farmers’ income (Silva
Neto et al., 2009; Jacquet et al., 2011).
The identification and hierarchization of limiting factors
associated to a technical and economic performance are
fundamental to fit strategies to increase economic return
(Ribeiro & Raiher, 2013). Nevertheless, this information is
scarce for wheat production in Brazil and it would contribute
to an increase of farmers’ income and make wheat a
continually attractive option to crop systems in Southern
Brazil. The variability of agronomic performance and of
the input use level of wheat commercial fields allows the
identification of the factors with the greatest contribution
to its economic performance. The objective of this study
was to identify the main factors related to the variability of
economic performance in wheat commercial fields in the
Southern Region of Paraná State.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study was based on data of wheat commercial
fields owned by farmers who are associated with a
cooperative situated in the Southern Region of Paraná
State, whose area of activity comprises 115.000 hectares
covering 14 cities. This region is composed by high yielding
environments for winter crops due to both climate and
edaphic potential and high input use (De Mori et al., 2016),
reaching one of the highest rainfed wheat yields in Brazil.
The climate of the region is classified as Cfb, in accordance
with the Koeppen classification, and the predominant soil
classes are Nitosols and Oxisol (Haplohumox) (Fontoura
et al., 2015).
The farmer population considered in this study was of
151, 172, and 181 farmers, both individual farmers and family
groups, in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. The family
groups corresponded to farmers, members of the same
family that share land, machinery, and labor. Stratified
random proportional sampling procedures were used
according to strata defined based on grain yield obtained
in each cropping season. The determination of strata was
based on value variation around average using grain yield
standard deviation in each cropping season. The
determined strata were Superior Strata (SS), Inferior Strata
(IS) and Medium Strata (MS). SS corresponded to wheat
fields with grain yield superior to average added one
standard deviation, while IS referred to wheat fields with
grain yield inferior to average minus one standard deviation.
MS corresponds to wheat fields with yield grains situated
between average plus or minus one standard deviation.
Sample size considered a margin of error of 10%, a
confidence level of 95%, and a population heterogeneity
of 50%. In 2013, 2014, and 2015 there were 65, 64, and 80
wheat commercial fields analyzed, respectively.
The data was obtained from the technical department
of the cooperative and from its research foundation. Data
about input costs, simplified gross margin (SGM) and
grain yield were gotten from the cooperative database,
and they were relative to each commercial field.
Meteorological information was taken from Simepar’s
Forecast Station at Entre Rios-Guarapuava.  The term
SGM was adopted because gross margin was calculated
considering only part of variable cost: seeds, fertilizers,
and plant protection input.
The variables evaluated were: fertilizer (starter
fertilization and nitrogen side dressing) costs; herbicide
costs; insecticide costs; fungicide costs; seed costs; grain
yield; and SGM. The costs with fertilizer, herbicide,
insecticide, fungicide, and seeds correspond to the value
per hectare paid by farmers for each item to the cooperative,
and its sum was called field establishment and plant
protection costs (FEPPC). SGM correspond to the
difference between gross income, which considered wheat
price and grain yield obtained, and FEPPC. The wheat price
was the same for all commercial fields in each year. All
values were corrected by IGP-M from January of each year
to January 2018 (FGVDados, 2018).
Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data
of each variable, followed by analysis of variance and
Tukey contrasts test. Subsequently, the data were
standardized using Z-score (Hair et al., 2009), and the
multivariate analysis was performed in two stages, adapted
from Ribeiro & Raiher (2013). First, the data were subjected
to Principal Component Analysis (PCA), considering costs
variables and grain yield as active ones to extract
components, and SGM as supplementary variable, which
in turn can have its variability explained by principal
components with which they have correlation. This
association allow the election of the most important
variables (Del Pozo et al., 2014).  The selection of the prin-
cipal components (PC) considered the minimum cumulative
explained variance of 70%.
In a second stage, all variables were used for commercial
fields classification using agglomerative hierarchical
clustering, considering the Euclidian distance as a measure
of distance between two points and the Ward’s method as
a classification algorithm. This method permits the
agglomeration of fields based on its similarity (Hair et al.,
2009).  The R Program was used to process the analysis,
using FactoMineR package for PCA, and the Cluster
package for clustering analysis.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In the three regarded cropping seasons, the fertilizers
cost corresponded to 50% of FEPPC, while seed cost
represented 22%, followed by fungicide cost (17%),
herbicide (6%), and insecticide cost (2%) (Table 1). The
FEPPC, gross income and SGM varied between years: the
lowest FEPPC and the highest gross income and SGM in
2013; the highest FEPPC and the lowest gross income and
SGM in 2015. The grain yield also varied between years,
and 2013 stood out with an average of 4.186 kg ha-1.
The fertilizer cost varied between years, with significant
difference between 2014 and 2015 (Table 1). Herbicide costs
did not vary in the period, whereas insecticide costs were
superior in 2014 and in 2015. The highest expense with
fungicide was in 2015, when it represented 20% of FEPPC.
In 2014, these costs were intermediate in relation to other
years, representing 16% of FEPPC, while in 2013 it was the
lowest, reaching 14% of FEPPC.  Seed costs also had
significant variation, with the highest value in 2014.
Considering the variance of 70%, three PC were selected
in each year (Table 2). In 2013, the first PC explained 37%
of the variance and showed significant positive correlation
with all variables related to costs, with the highest
correlation with fertilizer cost (0.77). Besides, the first PC
had a significant negative correlation with SGM, indicating
that commercial fields with high costs, especially with
fertilizers, obtained a lower economic return.  The second
PC showed a high positive correlation with grain yield
(0.91) and SGM (0.74), while the third one did not show
correlation with SGM. Thus, part of the variability of wheat
economic performance was associated mainly with
fertilizers cost and grain yield in 2013.
In 2014, the first PC explained 32% of the variance, with
positive correlation with fertilizer, herbicide, insecticide,
fungicide costs (0.84), and grain yield (0.72). The second
and the third PC presented the highest correlation values
with seed costs. However, there was no correlation between
the first three PC and SGM, indicating that the economic
performance variation could not be explained by studied
variables.
In 2015, the first PC explained 32% of the variance, and
had positive correlation with grain yield and with all
variables related to costs, with the fungicide costs
correlation of 0.75 standing out, but without correlation
with SGM. On the other hand, the second and the third PC
showed a significant correlation with SGM. The second
one presented negative correlation with SGM (-0.37) and
high positive correlation with seed costs (0.77), while the
third showed a positive correlation with SGM (0.77) and
grain yield (0.72).  Therefore, in 2015 part of the SGM
variability was explained mainly by seed costs and grain
yield.
In 2013, the commercial fields were clustered into two
groups (Table 3). Group 1 was formed by 31% of fields and
was characterized by higher input costs, lower grain yield
(3,618 kg ha-1), and SGM of R$1,938.08. Group 2 obtained a
productivity of 4,438 kg ha-1 and SGM of R$3,199.21 with a
lower cost, expending 78%, 55% and 80% of the values
invested in fertilizers, herbicides and insecticides in group
1, respectively. The results did not show a relationship
between input cost and grain yield, otherwise commercial
fields with high grain yields and lower cost obtained a
better economic performance, according to PCA results.
In 2014, commercial fields were clustered into four
groups (Table 3). Group 1, which comprised 16% of the
commercial fields, reached the highest SGM, being 74%
superior to average of groups 2, 3, and 4. Also, group 1
had a grain yield of 4,008 kg ha-1 and a lower investment in

fertilizers and fungicides, that corresponding to 66% and
78% of average value invested in another groups. Group
2, composed by 41% of fields, achieved grain yield of 4,037
kg ha-1 and SGM of R$947.08, and had the highest fungicide
costs. Group 3, formed by eleven fields, obtained the lowest
productivity (3,183 kg ha-1), an intermediate input costs
and SGM (R$649.85). Group 4, representing 26% of fields,
had grain yield of 4,060 kg ha-1, SGM of R$870.01 and the
highest expense with seeds, which corresponded to 29%
of FEPPC. It is important to highlight the observed for the
groups 1, 2 and 4, that representing 83% of fields and
obtained a similar grain yield with a different cost profile,
which determined its SGM.  This result might indicate
differences in wheat crop management and on the
production system one, what could have contributed to
cost reduction and to increase the yield potential of fields.
In 2015, three groups were formed with great differences
in SGM, varying between negative ones (-R$237.41) to
R$923.32 (Table 3). Group 1, representing 60% of fields,
obtained the lowest grain yield (2,408 kg ha-1) and SGM of
R$200.30, while Group 2, corresponding to 21% of fields,
reached the highest productivity (3,359 kg ha-1) and SGM
(R$923.32). Group 3, formed by 19% of fields, adopted the
highest investment in fertilizer, herbicides, fungicide and
seeds, had grain yield of 2,714 kg ha-1 and a negative SGM
of -R$237.41. Part of these results agree with PCA analysis,
which indicated seed cost and grain yield and as the main
factors related with SGM variability. It is worth noting the
observed with Groups 1 and 2, that had a similar cost profile
with an important difference in grain yield (951 kg ha-1),
which probably is related to choices adopted in the crop
management as well.
Grain yield, fertilizers and seed costs were the main
factors related to SGM variability in the studied period.
Fertilizers represent the most important cost component
for wheat production (Hirakuri, 2013), and its suitability
based on agronomic parameters could have an important
effect on its economic performance, as observed in cluster
analysis as well (Tables 1, 2 and 3). The seed costs were
the second principal one and it was important to SGM
variability in 2015, probably because of the increase in
sowing density or the adoption of cultivars of high seed

Factors related to the economic performance of wheat commercial fields

price. In addition to direct effect on economic performance,
the use of high sowing may indirectly reduce income as a
result of grain yield decrease caused by intraspecific
competition and lodging (Fioreze & Rodrigues, 2014).
Wheat grain yield explained part of SGM variability in two
cropping seasons analyzed, similar to results found for
sunflower economic performance in Paraná using the same
methodology (Ribeiro & Raiher, 2013). Grain yield and price
are decisive in determining gross income. Considering the
impossibility of price control, grain yield is a key
component to increase wheat economic performance.
The results did not show an association between
commercial fields investment in FEPPC and grain yield,
only with some cost items, especially fungicide cost (Tables
2 and 3). This reinforces the complexity of grain yield
determination, which depends on factors that define, limit,
reduce, and the level of intervention of the crop
management on these factors (Loomis & Connor, 2002),
and not about the level of inputs invested only. Moreover,
considering the importance of cost benefit relationship,
obtaining high grain yields based on a high input cost
may not compensate the investment, reducing the
economic revenue or turn it small (Baumgratz et al., 2017).
It was showed in 2015, when a group of commercial fields
with the highest cost and an intermediate grain yield had a
negative SGM, while 60% of analyzed fields reached a small
and positive SGM with a lower grain yield (Table 3). For
this reason, the crop planning should consider the balan-
ce between production cost and productivity.
Also, the results did not presented relation between
FEPPC and SGM, which are close to those obtained by
Nave et al. (2013), where farmers with intermediate input
levels got the highest gross margin. Our findings are also
in agreement with other authors like Silva Neto et al.
(2009), who used decision support models to different
input levels in wheat crops, and Jacquet et al. (2011),

who concluded that farmer’s income could remain
unchanged with pesticide reduction by 30%. Therefore,
the results indicate that high use of inputs did not ensure
high grain yield nor SGM, reinforcing the importance of a
suitable crop management to achieve a better agronomic
and economic return.
It must be considered the role of the management
practices adopted during the cropping season and on the
farm management system on cost reduction as well, as
suggested to results observed on clustering analysis
(Table 3). The use of integrated management practices can
reduce costs due to rationalization of products use related
to plant protection (Nichols et al., 2015; Shah et al., 2018),
and other choices as sowing density can reduce seed costs,
as discuss above. Furthermore, the farm management
system, including crop rotation systems and soil and water
conservation practices, for instance, can promote
improvements on soil physico-chemical parameters, which
might decrease the use of fertilizers, increment the crops
yield potential, and contribute to weed and disease control
too (Kumar et al., 2015).
The most important cost components related with
field establishment and plant protection for SGM
variability were different in each mentioned year. This
result might be associated with environmental variation
between years that can determine part of the management
applied and, consequently, the costs. The grain yield of
wheat commercial fields in 2013 and 2014 agree with the
favorable environmental conditions in the region of
Guarapuava for those years (Figure 1), especially 2013,
with average of 4,186 and 3,897 kg ha-1, respectively. In
2015, the wheat crop performance was inferior (2,668 kg
ha-1), concurring with the occurrence of El Niño
phenomenon, with rainfall above average in September,
October, and November (Figure 1). The yield potential in
that period, estimated by experimental grain yield in the
same region, indicates how severe the environmental
limitation was (Table 1).
The correlations between El Niño and yield are
consistently negative for wheat in the south of Brazil
(Anderson et al., 2016). The high precipitation during
wheat flowering seasons leads to a higher probability of
Fusarium Head Blight (FHB) (Fusarium graminearum)
occurrence, a fungal disease that attacks spikes and can
cause severe losses on yield (Del Ponte et al., 2009). This
situation may imply a rise in fungicide applications,
increasing the fungicide cost and total cost and decreasing
the economic performance (Tables 1 and 3). Besides, the
high precipitation might increase nitrogen and other
nutrients losses (Marschner & Rengel, 2012), and imply in
reduction of wheat price due to mycotoxins levels (Wilson
et al., 2018). Thus, under these conditions, there are many
sources with potential to decrease the economic
performance, which can cite low yield potential, lower price
and high plant protection costs.
The results indicated that grain yield as an important
element for the wheat economic performance, reinforcing
the importance of using practices of crop integrated
management to power grain yield at a low cost.
Considering the field establishment and plant protection
costs, the adjustment of fertilizers doses and plant density
to crop conditions, and adoption of cultivars with good
cost-benefit ratio, could contribute to reduce these input
costs. The use of integrated management practices is an
important strategy to decrease the use of chemical control
of weeds, diseases and insects, and reduce costs as well.
In the case of FHB disease, sowing date scheduling and
selection of cultivars with the best reaction to this disease
are fundamental. Improvements in application timing and
spraying technology can contribute to the product
efficiency use and the reduction of costs; using a disease
model can help on the decision-making process. The
consideration of these aspects has potential to increase
the economic return of wheat fields contributing to
maintain this crop on production systems in the Southern
Region of Paraná State.
CONCLUSIONS
Grain yield is one of the most important factors on
determination of economic performance in wheat
commercial fields in the Southern Region of Paraná State.
Besides, a greater investment in fertilizers and in seed can
decrease it in this region.
It must be considered that the cost reduction is not
related with input cost reduction only but could be
obtained with management practices adopted during the
cropping season and on the farm management system as
well. Also, the contribution of costs related with field
establishment and plant protection to the variability of
economic performance may be different in each cropping
season probably due to variations of the cost profile and
grain yield.
The inclusion of all items of variable cost in the future
studies can improve the discussion about factors related
with wheat economic performance. Also, the method could
be considered in studies for another wheat producer region
and can contribute with information to decision-making
process about both crop and inputs management.
