Abstract 
Background: The ocular surface is separated by a thin layer of tear 
film from outdoor air pollutants making individuals exposed to 
outdoor air pollution prone to various ocular surface disorders. The 
aim of this study was to determine the magnitude of ocular surface 
disorders symptoms among traffic police officers of Kathmandu, 
Nepal. 
  
Methods: Two hundred traffic police officers working at different 
traffic police office branches of Kathmandu, Nepal were invited to the 
police headquarters for eye and vision examination. Among them, 91 
individuals (95% males) completed the ocular surface disease index 
(OSDI) questionnaire and underwent Schirmer’s I tear test. 
  
Results: Symptoms of ocular surface disorders were reported by over 
80% of the individuals. Approximately two fifths of the individuals 
(38%) reported severe symptoms.  Only 17% of the individuals’ tear 
secretion was found to be below normal using the Schirmer’s tear 
test.  There was no association between the OSDI score and 
Schirmer’s tear test scores (r = 0.008, p = 0.94). A weak but significant 
relationship was observed between the OSDI score and job duration 
(r=0.21,p = 0.04). Individual exposed to outdoor air pollution for more 
than 10 years had higher odds of reporting ocular surface complaints 
as compared to those who were exposed for less than 10 years (OR = 
3.94, p = 0.02). 
  
Conclusion: Ocular surface disorder symptoms are common among 
traffic police officers of Kathmandu, Nepal. The duration of exposure 
appears to significantly contribute to the increased symptoms in this 
vulnerable population.

Introduction
Studies conducted so far on air pollution and the human ocular 
surface have demonstrated a link between air pollution and 
ocular discomfort, abnormal tear structure, and ocular surface 
inflammation1. There are only a handful of studies demonstrat-
ing the association between the signs and symptoms of the ocular 
surface with air pollution2,3. Studies are even more infrequent 
from cities in developing countries, where the concentration of 
air pollutants in the environment is on the rise. Kathmandu is 
considered as one of the most highly polluted cities in the 
world, and Nepal is listed as one of the most polluted coun-
tries according to the WHO urban air pollution database. Traffic 
police officers in Kathmandu spend most of their time outdoors, 
controlling the flow of vehicles because of the unavailability of 
modern electronic traffic management systems in the city.
The purpose of this study was to determine the magnitude of 
ocular surface disorders based on a subjective symptoms ques-
tionnaire and a commonly used tear secretion test (Schirmer’s 
I test), and then explore the association between these two tests 
in traffic police officers of Kathmandu, Nepal.
Methods
Study population
This 
study 
involved 
a 
cross-sectional, 
community-based 
assessment on 91 traffic police officers (86 male, 5 female) 
recruited among the officers of the Traffic Metropolitan head 
office, 
Baggikhana, 
Kathmandu, 
Nepal. 
The 
participants 
were invited by word of mouth by the head officer along with 
a formal written notice. Participants with any chronic illness, 
smoking habit, taking any systemic drugs, having any ocular 
diseases, previous ocular surgery and current contact lens wear 
were excluded from the study. All of the individuals had present-
ing visual acuity of better than 20/25 at both near and far. Only 
those participants who met our inclusion criteria and agreed to 
participate were included in the study. The study was conducted 
in the month of August 2017.
Ethics and consent
The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of 
the Nepal Health Research Council (Reg.No.,218/2017). The 
study was part of a larger program that was aimed at determin-
ing ocular and visual disorders in police officers. All of the 
research participants provided their written informed consent 
for participation before being enrolled in the study. The 
Declaration of Helsinki was followed while assessing the 
participants.
Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) Questionnaire
The Ocular Surface Disease Index Questionnaire4 is a validated 
tool to assess the subjective symptoms of individuals with 
potential ocular surface disorders. The Nepali translated OSDI 
questionnaire was administered to all of the participants before 
conducting the clinical assessment. An OSDI score of 0–12 was 
considered normal, 13–22 as mild, 23–32 as moderate, and 
33–100 as a severe ocular surface disorder5.
Schirmer I test
The Schirmer I tear test was conducted under topical anesthe-
sia (0.5% Proparacaine). The test was conducted in an indoor 
setting at room temperature. After instilling one drop of propa-
racaine in each eye, the eye was dried with cotton for any 
residual drop. The Schirmer strip was then placed on the lateral 
1/3rd aspect of the lower eye lid taking special care not to touch 
the cornea. The strip was removed from the lid after 5 minutes. 
The measurement of 5mm or less was considered as abnormal.
Ophthalmological examination
Routine ophthalmological examination including visual acuity, 
refraction, anterior segment assessment and posterior segment 
assessment was also conducted but were not analysed as a part of 
this study
Other variables
Other variables such as age, gender, and duration of working as a 
traffic officer were also recorded.
Statistical analysis
The OSDI score was calculated using the following formula:
(Sum of scores for all questions answered) X 25
      (total number of questions answered)
Data are presented as mean±SD unless mentioned otherwise. 
Independent sample t-test was employed for comparing mean 
between two groups whereas one way ANOVA, along with 
appropriate posthoc tests, was employed for comparing means 
between three or more groups. Pearson correlation was employed 
to determine the association between variables. Binary logistic 
regression analysis was also employed to determine association 
between dependent and independent variables. Statistical analysis 
was conducted using SPSS V22, IBM, California
Results
The mean age of the participants was 32±6 years. The OSDI 
questionnaire was completed by all subjects. The mean OSDI 
score was 30.11±19.70 (range 2 to 97.90). Based on the OSDI 
score, 81% of the participants reported symptoms of ocular sur-
face disorder; over one third (38%) of the participants reported 
symptoms of severe ocular surface disorder (Figure 1).
Schirmer’s test of both eyes was conducted in 91% of the par-
ticipants. The mean ± SD Schirmer’s test value (mm) for right 
eye (RE) and left eye (LE) was 16.12±10.42 and 17.42±10.84, 
respectively. There was a high correlation (r= 0.80, p<0.001) 
but a non-significant difference (p=0.08) in the Schirmer’s test 
score between the two eyes. Hence the results of the right eye 
only were used for analysis. Only 17% of the subjects’ Schirmer’s 
score showed abnormal results.

No association was observed between the OSDI score and 
the Schirmer’s test results (r=0.008, p=0.94). No significant 
correlation was also observed between the OSDI scores and age 
(r=0.15, p=0.14). A weak, but statistically significant, positive 
correlation was observed between OSDI score and dura-
tion of work (r=0.21, p=0.04). The mean duration of work was 
11±6 years. Individuals who had held the job for more than 
5 years had severe symptoms, as compared to those who had 
held the job for less than five years (p=0.001). A one way 
ANOVA test demonstrated a significant difference in the OSDI 
score between different age groups (<30, 30–40 and >40 years) 
(F2,88 = 3.86, p=0.025). The symptoms score was statistically sig-
nificantly different between individuals who had worked for up 
to 5 years, six to ten years (mean difference, 13.65 ± 6.44, 
95% CI, 0.85 to 26.46) and more than 10 years (mean difference, 
16.48± 5.93, 95% CI, 4.70 to 28.27). However, no statistically 
significant difference was observed between individuals who 
had held the job for 6–10 years and >10 years (mean difference 
2.82 ± 4.54, 95% CI, - 6.20 to 11.50) (Figure 2). Furthermore, 
individuals who held the job for 10 years or more had 
significantly higher odds of having ocular surface symptoms 
as compared to those who had the job for less than ten years 
(OR: 3.94, 95% CI, 1.25-12.8, p = 0.02). There was a slight 
increase in the odds of having ocular surface symptoms after 
adjusting for age and gender, but it was borderline significant 
(OR: 4.28, 95% CI, 0.93-19.58, p = 0.05)
Of the 74 subjects identified as having symptoms of ocular 
surface disorders according to the OSDI score, only 16 were 
identified as abnormal by the Schirmer’s test.

Discussion
This study explored the symptoms of ocular surface disorders 
among individuals exposed to traffic-derived air pollution 
in Kathmandu, Nepal. A remarkable number of individuals 
reported symptoms with over one third reporting symptoms 
of severe ocular surface disorder. Ocular surface disorder vary 
with age, whereby the prevalence is 11% among individuals 
between 40 to 59, and 18% in individuals above 806. In this study, 
individuals were between 18 to 48 years, and 80% had symptoms 
of OSD, which is alarmingly high as compared to the general 
population6.
Previous reports exploring symptoms in individuals exposed 
to traffic-derived air pollution have found mixed results. The 
Torricelli et al.7 study in a group of 71 taxi drivers and traffic 
controllers reported that most of their subjects reported few 
symptoms, and fell within the normal category according to the 
OSDI scoring. However, they demonstrated that objective tests 
such as tear osmolarity and break up time were significantly 
reduced. In contrast, Saxena et al. reported that most of the 
subjects who were exposed to air pollution had more symptoms 
(irritation, itching, lacrimation, and redness) as compared those 
who were not exposed2.
A majority of the individuals’ Schirmer’s results were within 
normal range in the present study. Similar normal findings of 
Schirmer’s test have been found by previous researchers7,8. This 
finding is not surprising as the poor diagnostic ability of the 
Schirmer’s test for detecting ocular surface dysfunction has been 
well recorded in the literature9. The Schirmer’s test has shown 
normal results in many previous studies conducted among 
established dry eye population9.
The lack of correlation between the OSDI scores and the 
Schirmer’s results is also not surprising, as this finding is con-
sistent with most of the previous studies where the signs and 
symptoms of ocular surface disorders, particularly that of the dry 
eyes, are not correlated with one another10. It is postulated that 
dry eye is a multifactorial disorder, and different mechanisms and 
factors act in compliment or may act independently to elicit the 
symptomatology of this condition11.
The weak but statistically significant positive correlation 
between the OSDI score and duration of holding the current job 
(years) implies that the longer the exposure, the more severe the 
symptoms. However, the finding that the mean symptom score 
is not significantly different between individuals who have held 
the job for 6–10 years and in those over 10 years signifies that 
exposure to ambient air pollution over 5 years poses a signifi-
cant impact on the ocular surface. Furthermore, the higher odds 
of having ocular symptoms in individuals with over 10 years of 
holding the job implies that the effect of air pollution on the 
ocular surface may have a cumulative effect over the years until 
symptoms start to appear.
Nepal was ranked as the 177th country just above China, 
Bangladesh, and India among the 180 countries with air quality 
issues according to the Environmental Performance Index (EPI) of 
201612. A report in 2007 on the air pollution concentration, spe-
cifically of the PM2.5 of the Kathmandu valley, was found to be 
17-18 fold higher than the recommended 25ug/m3 threshold pro-
vided by the WHO. A 2016 air pollution report of Nepal pro-
vided by the WHO has shown a considerable increase in PM2.5 
concentration over a decade13. Our study was conducted in the 
month of August 2017. The mean 24-hour average PM2.5 con-
centration during that month was 113.5 ug/m3(approximately 5 
fold higher than that recommended by the WHO) and the PM10 
concentration was 633ug/m3(approximately 13 fold higher than 
the WHO recommendation) (see Kathmandu Air Pollution: Real-
time Air Quality Index and Department of Environment, Air 
Quality Monitoring). In light of the high levels of air pollution of 
Kathmandu, the higher number of individuals reporting 
severe symptoms of ocular surface disease in our study can be 
explained.
While this study provided novel ocular health issues in this vul-
nerable population, some limitations must be acknowledged. 
Firstly, only two tests were used – the OSDI questionnaire and 
the Schirmer’s I test to determine ocular surface disorder. Use 
of more sensitive tests such as corneal and conjunctival staining, 
tear film break up time and tear osmolarity would have detected 
more individuals with ocular surface disorders, and may also have 
demonstrated structural/physiological anomalies of the ocular sur-
face. However, as this was a community-based study, tests were 
chosen based on the non-requirement of sophisticated clinical 
instruments and investigations. Secondly, the actual duration and 
concentration of air pollution exposures in our subjects were 
not assessed. Measurement of the PM2.5 and NO2 concentration, 
along with a range of ocular surface disorder diagnostic tests like 
that of a few previous studies, would have provided us a better 
understanding of the association between air pollution and ocu-
lar surface disorders. Thirdly, a comparison with a control group 
of individuals who were not exposed to a different level of air 
pollution would have confirmed that the ocular symptoms were 
primarily due to air pollution. Nevertheless, this study was a 
first step toward generating awareness, and exploring symptoms 
related to ocular surface disorder in the vulnerable population. 
Future large-scale studies need to be conducted in city areas to 
explore ocular surface anomalies in this vulnerable population 
and necessary precautions are taken in order to protect the 
ocular health of people exposed to outdoor air pollution.
Conclusion
Traffic police officers of Kathmandu valley have a high preva-
lence of ocular surface complaints, which do not correlate well 
with the subjective tear secretion test. The duration of job appears 
to somewhat contribute to the increasing symptoms. In the 
meantime, the use of protective sunglasses and regular eye con-
sultations for people who are exposed to outdoor air pollution is

recommended. More importantly, the government must implement 
new rules to reduce the levels of outdoor air pollution.

The study evaluated the eye symptoms and the lacrymal production of traffic police officers in 
Kathmandu, Nepal, a city with high levels of air pollution. 
 
As the study refers to the effects of air pollution on the ocular surface of traffic police officers, it is 
necessary to mention the average concentration of air pollutants during August 2017, mainly PM
2.5 and NO2. Vehicles are generally the main responsible for the emission of nitrogen oxides, since 
in Kathmandu vehicular traffic seems to be very intense, the additional information about these 
air pollutants is essential as part of the study. 
 
In addition to the air pollutants, I suggest mentioning the meteorological data, such as humidity 
and temperature, since these climatic factors may influence the clinical parameters of the ocular 
surface. 
 
The study was conducted during the hot and rainy season. In this period there is an increase of 
allergies and conjunctivitis and among the symptoms, an increased frequency of itching, foreign 
body sensation and photophobia. In addition, the use of fans and air conditioning is greater. All 
these factors could influence and favor the appearance of symptoms and the increase of OSDI 
score. Thus, in future studies, it would be interesting to carry out the same tests and 
ophthalmologic examinations during  the dry season in the same group of traffic police officers. 
 
Besides that, OSDI checks the symptoms during the last week. The reproducibility of symptoms of 
the OSDI questionnaire at different periods could be indicative of the prevalence of symptoms for 
a long period due to air pollution exposure and  could be more certainty correlate with the 
working time in the traffic. I suggest that the correlation between the OSDI score and working 
time should be mentioned with caution in the text, once this is a cross-sectional study. 
 
I recommend  the availability of an OSDI table describing the frequency of symptoms in the 
attachment.

The authors mentioned very well the limitations of the study. Despite the application of only two 
ophthalmological parameters (OSDI questionnaire and Schirmer test), I recommend the indexing 
of the article since studies about the effects of air pollution in areas of high air pollutant levels, as 
in Kathmandu, it is necessary to evidence its effects on the ocular surface and to strengthen public 
policies in this area.

Dear Dr Matsuda,  
 
Thank you for your time to review our manuscript and providing us with an opportunity to 
revise the manuscript.  We have endeavoured to address each comment and suggestions. 
Please see below.

the emission of nitrogen oxides, since in Kathmandu vehicular traffic seems to be very 
intense, the additional information about these air pollutants is essential as part of the 
study." 
 
Response: Thank you very much for your comment. We agree with the comments. We had 
already provided the August 2017 data on PM2.5 and PM10 concentration in the first version. 
As there is no national mechanism to measure the NO2 system in Nepal the data from 
August 2017 is not available. However, in our latest version, we have included the NO2 data 
of 2015. Please refer to the introduction.  
 
Comment: In addition to the air pollutants, I suggest mentioning the meteorological data, 
such as humidity and temperature, since these climatic factors may influence the clinical 
parameters of the ocular surface. 
 
Response: Thank you. The meteorological data has now been added.  
 
 
Comment:  The study was conducted during the hot and rainy season. In this period there is 
an increase of allergies and conjunctivitis and among the symptoms, an increased 
frequency of itching, foreign body sensation and photophobia. In addition, the use of fans 
and air conditioning is greater. All these factors could influence and favor the appearance 
of symptoms and the increase of OSDI score. Thus, in future studies, it would be interesting 
to carry out the same tests and ophthalmologic examinations during the dry season in the 
same group of traffic police officers.  
 
Response: We absolutely agree with the comment. We have included these factors in the 
discussion. We also agree that it would be interesting to carry out the same tests and 
ophthalmologic examination during the dry season in the same group to gain a better 
understanding of the causative factors of ocular symptoms in this population. We are 
planning such a study at the moment.  
 
Comment: Besides that, OSDI checks the symptoms during the last week. The 
reproducibility of symptoms of the OSDI questionnaire at different periods could be 
indicative of the prevalence of symptoms for a long period due to air pollution exposure 
and could be more certainty correlate with the working time in the traffic. I suggest that 
the correlation between the OSDI score and working time should be mentioned with 
caution in the text, once this is a cross-sectional study. 
 
Response: Thank you very much for this close observation. We have mentioned the cross-
sectional nature of the study as one of the limitations and hence have advised that caution 
must be applied before interpreting the research findings.  
 
Comment: I recommend the availability of an OSDI table describing the frequency of 
symptoms in the attachment. 
 
Response: We have attached the OSDI form as an attachment.

This paper describes a limited analysis of eye symptoms in a small group of traffic police officers in 
Kathmandu, Nepal. Despite the limitations of the cross-sectional set-up and limited resources, this 
analysis merits publication because of the small volume of studies on ophthalmological effects of 
air pollution and the health effects of air pollution in non-western countries with extremely high 
air pollution exposures. 
The article would benefit from a brief description of concentrations of other common (gaseous or 
solid) air pollutants (NO2, CO, BC) during August 2017 and annual averages in the previous years 
in Kathmandu if available. 
  
The total number of questions in the OSDI questionnaire could be mentioned to facilitate the 
interpretation of the formula used. 
  
The description of the Schirmer I test is too brief to be easily understood by air pollution scientists 
who are no experts in ophthalmology. To consider only values <5 mm as abnormal seems to be a 
very strict definition e.g. compared to results presented by Karampatakis et al.1. Based on RE & LE 
combined the % of abnormal tests is less than 15% (not 17%). 
Also there is no explanation about the OSDI of the 9% of participants that did not undergo a 
Schirmer I test, this could potentially lead to biased results. 
  
In Figure 1 the categories of Mild (23%) and Moderate (20%) seem to have been mixed up. The 
authors should double check whether this also happened with other categorizations (not available 
from the provided data) and repeat the statistical analysis if necessary. By providing more original

(not categorized) data reanalysis of the data by other researchers would also be facilitated. 
The methods section does not mention that a paired t-test was used to compare results of the 
Schirmers I test for RE and LE. 
  
Because of the cross-sectional set-up of the study it would be more prudent to avoid the word 
‘implies’ in the discussion and instead use ‘suggests’. 
  
The authors provide a good assessment of some of the limitations/weaknesses of their study. 
Including the lack of a control group, lack of personal/detailed exposure data or on groups with a 
different level of exposure and lack of more sophisticated eye tests. The inherent limitations of the 
cross-sectional set-up should also be mentioned. 
  
The study population of traffic police officers could perhaps better be characterized as a ‘more 
exposed’ population instead of ‘vulnerable’ unless there would be a reason why these adults would 
be more vulnerable than other population groups. 
  
With respect to their recommendation of wearing sunglasses the authors should provide a 
reference to a source providing evidence for the benefits of such an intervention. Were the traffic 
police officers questioned on the frequency of use of sunglasses during work? 
  
Some minor language issues could be corrected.

Dear Dr Panis,  
 
Thank you very much for taking the time to review our manuscript. We have done our best 
to address your comments. We hope that our reply is satisfactory and that we have 
responded to, and dealt with, all comments adequately. Please see responses below: 
 
Comment: This paper describes a limited analysis of eye symptoms in a small group of 
traffic police officers in Kathmandu, Nepal. Despite the limitations of the cross-sectional 
set-up and limited resources, this analysis merits publication because of the small volume 
of studies on ophthalmological effects of air pollution and the health effects of air 
pollution in non-western countries with extremely high air pollution exposures. 
 
Response: Thank you very much for your kind comments. We agree with the limitations of 
the study but hope that this study will be the first one to raise awareness among affected 
individuals and concerned parties regarding the effect of air pollution on ocular health.  
 
Comment: The article would benefit from a brief description of concentrations of other 
common (gaseous or solid) air pollutants (NO2, CO, BC) during August 2017 and annual 
averages in the previous years in Kathmandu if available. 
 
Response: Thank you very much. We apologise for the unavailability of the NO2, CO and BC 
data for the month of August 2017 as Nepal does not have a national mechanism to collect 
these data. We have gathered as much relevant information as we can from the published 
literature and have incorporated in the latest version.  
  
Comment: The total number of questions in the OSDI questionnaire could be mentioned to 
facilitate the interpretation of the formula used. 
  
Response: This has now been incorporated with the OSDI questionnaire attached as a 
supplementary file.  
 
Comment: The description of the Schirmer I test is too brief to be easily understood by 
air pollution scientists who are no experts in ophthalmology. To consider only values 
<5 mm as abnormal seems to be a very strict definition e.g. compared to results 
presented by Karampatakis et al.1 
 
Response: Thank you for this thoughtful comment. We have included some additional 
information regarding the Schirmer's test. The value of <5mm for abnormal was based on

its diagnostic accuracy. This has been briefly mentioned in the manuscript.  
 
Comment: Based on RE & LE combined the % of abnormal tests is less than 15% (not 17%). 
Also there is no explanation about the OSDI of the 9% of participants that did not undergo 
a Schirmer I test, this could potentially lead to biased results. 
 
Response: Thank you for pointing this out. We have rectified the percentage. We apologise 
for the lack of clarification regarding the 91% who underwent the Schirmer Test. This data 
was based on an earlier data analysis. We did not include the data from those patients who 
had incomplete information hence they were not analysed in this study. Only participants 
who had both the Schirmer's and OSDI scores were included in the study.  
  
Comment:In Figure 1 the categories of Mild (23%) and Moderate (20%) seem to have been 
mixed up. The authors should double check whether this also happened with other 
categorizations (not available from the provided data) and repeat the statistical analysis if 
necessary. By providing more original (not categorized) data reanalysis of the data by 
other researchers would also be facilitated. 
 
Response: We have now rectified the percentage. This was an error during plotting the 
graph. We confirm that this has not affected any other analysis. The dataset file consists of 
all the information that we collected and were relevant to the study project. The 
categorisation of age group was suggested by the editorial office.  
 
Comment: The methods section does not mention that a paired t-test was used to compare 
results of the Schirmers I test for RE and LE. 
  
 
Response: Thank you very much. We have mentioned it now.  
 
Comments: Because of the cross-sectional set-up of the study it would be more prudent to 
avoid the word ‘implies’ in the discussion and instead use ‘suggests’. 
  
 Response: We have changed to suggests as recommended.  
 
Comments: The authors provide a good assessment of some of the limitations/weaknesses 
of their study. Including the lack of a control group, lack of personal/detailed exposure 
data or on groups with a different level of exposure and lack of more sophisticated eye 
tests. The inherent limitations of the cross-sectional set-up should also be mentioned. 
  
Response: Thank you so much for your kind comments. We have added the cross-sectional 
nature of the study as one of the limitations and have advised readers that the results must 
be interpreted with caution.  
 
Comments: The study population of traffic police officers could perhaps better be 
characterized as a ‘more exposed’ population instead of ‘vulnerable’ unless there would be 
a reason why these adults would be more vulnerable than other population groups.

Response: We have changed vulnerable to more exposed. Thank you.  
  
Comment: With respect to their recommendation of wearing sunglasses the authors should 
provide a reference to a source providing evidence for the benefits of such an intervention. 
Were the traffic police officers questioned on the frequency of use of sunglasses during 
work? 
 
Response: We have added a reference that reports the beneficial effect of glasses on ocular 
surface disorders such as dry eyes. Unfortunately, we did not ask any questions regarding 
the frequency of the use of sunglasses during work but will definitely consider for future 
studies.  
  
Comments: Some minor language issues could be corrected. 
 
Response: We have attempted to reduce such issues as much as possible.  
Competing Interests: No competing interests.
