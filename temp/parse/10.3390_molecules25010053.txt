Abstract:
The synthesis of a number of pentaborate(1-) salts from cations arising from
N-substituted α,α-, α,β-, and α,γ-diaminoalkanes has been attempted in aqueous solution
from B(OH)3 and the appropriate diammine in a 10:1 ratio.
Despite relatively mild
work-up conditions the pentaborate(1-) salts prepared were not always as anticipated and
the following compounds were isolated in good yield: [Me2NH(CH2)2NHMe2][B5O6(OH)4]2 (1),
[Et2NH(CH2)2NHEt2][B5O6(OH)4]2
(2),
[Et2NH2][B5O6(OH)4]
(3),
[Me2NH2][B5O6(OH)4]
(4),
[Me2NH(CH2)3NHMe2][B5O6(OH)4]2
(5),
[Et2NH(CH2)3NHEt2][B5O6(OH)4]2
(6),
[Me3NCH2CH=CH2][B5O6(OH)4]
(7),
and
[Me3N(CH2)3NMe3]
[B5O6(OH)4]2.0.5H2O
(8).
The tetraborate(2-) salt, [Me3N(CH2)2NMe3][B4O5(OH)4].2B(OH)3.2H2O (9) was obtained in
moderate yield (41%) from a 3:1 reaction of B(OH)3 with [Me3N(CH2)2NMe3](OH)2. All compounds
were characterized by spectroscopy (1H, 11B, 13C NMR and IR) and thermal gravimetric analysis
(TGA). BET analysis on materials derived thermally from selected samples (1, 2, 6, 7) all had porosities
of < 1 m2/g, demonstrating that they were non-porous. Single-crystal XRD structures were obtained
for 2, 3, 7, 8 and 9 and all contain extensive H-bonded polyborate lattices.

1. Introduction
Salts and neutral species containing polyoxidoborate (polyborate) anions occur as minerals and
many synthetic derivatives have now also been prepared [1–5]. These compounds are structurally
diverse, with the polyborate anions generally comprised of trigonal planar 3-coordinate and tetrahedral
4-coordinate boron centres, linked via oxygen bridges with as many terminal OH or O−groups as is
necessary to complete the required geometry at boron [6–11]. Some polyborate salts are sold as bulk
chemicals for use in the glass/vitreous, ﬁre retardant, and agricultural industries [12–14], whilst other
synthetic polyborates have interesting and specialized physical e.g., semiconducting, luminescent,
non-linear optical (NLO) properties [5,15]. We are interested in synthetic polyborate chemistry and
recently have started to investigate non-metal cation stabilized silicate/borate solutions as potential

bio-stimulants for agricultural use [12,16,17]. Since choline-like cations and tetraalkylammonium
cations are known to structure-direct silicate species towards cubic octasilicate [Si8O12+n(OH)8-n]n-
anions [18,19] our attention has been directed towards N-substituted aminoalkane and N-substituted
α,ω-diaminoalkane cations. This has led us to investigate, as part of a broader parallel study on
synthetic polyborate chemistry, the interaction in aqueous solution between B(OH)3 and cations derived
from N-substituted α,ω-diaminoalkanes and the results of this investigation are presented in this
manuscript. In particular we report herein the synthesis and characterization of seven new polyborate
salts together with single-crystal XRD studies on ﬁve of these compounds. Schematic drawings of
the pentaborate(1-) and tetraborate(2-) anions present in these salts are given in Figure 1. Aspects of
solid-state H-bond interactions, important in stabilizing the solid-state structures, are also discussed.

2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Synthesis
Synthetic strategies to prepare pentaborate(1-) salts partnered with organic cations include the
reaction of a free base amine with B(OH)3 in aqueous solution or use of OH- activated ion-exchange resins
with quaternary ammonium halide salts [5]. Schubert and co-workers [19] have successfully applied the
former method to α,ω-diaminoalkanes and have isolated a number of pentaborate(1-) salts containing
a +2 diammonium cations of composition [H3N(CH2)xNH3][B5O6(OH)4]2 (x = 5, 6, 8-12). In this study,
the pentaborate(1-) salts [Me2NH(CH2)2NHMe2][B5O6(OH)4]2 (1), [Et2NH(CH2)2NHEt2][B5O6(OH)4]2
(2), [Et2NH2][B5O6(OH)4] (3), [Me2NH2][B5O6(OH)4] (4), [Me2NH(CH2)3NHMe2][B5O6(OH)4]2 (5),
and [Et2NH(CH2)3NHEt2][B5O6(OH)4]2 (6) were readily prepared as crystalline solids from aqueous
solution in yields of 87–99% by the reaction of 10 equivalents of B(OH)3 with the diaminoalkane
in aqueous solution at room temperature. Compounds 2, 3, 5 and 6 are previously unreported.
Compound 1 has recently been prepared serendipitously in low yield (~10%) as a by-product from the
reaction of a ﬂuorinated borane CF3(CF2)5CH2(OLi)CH2PPh2.BH3 with [PtCl2(COD)] in the presence
of Me2N(CH2)2NMe2 [20]. Likewise, 4 has been previously obtained in very low yield (a few crystals)
as a by-product of a reaction of B(OH)3 with B2(NMe2)4 followed by crystallization from water [21].
N,N,N’N’-Tetraakyldiaminomethane cations are less stable than the tetrasubstituted diaminoethane or
diaminopropane cations in aqueous solution and the formation of the corresponding dialkylammonium
pentaborate(1-) salts 3 and 4 in high yields is not unexpected and further demonstrates the ready
cleavage of the C-N aminal bonds [22–25]. Further characterization data for 1 and 4 are reported within
this manuscript. Scheme 1 contains all the reactions studied in this work.

followed by removal of the aqueous solvent on a hot water bath and oven drying (65 ◦C).
This product rather than the expected product, [Me3N(CH2)3NMe3][B5O6(OH)4]2 was obtained since
the [Me3N(CH2)3NMe3]2+ cation initially present rapidly undergoes a Hofmann elimination [26,27],
with elimination of NMe3, under the workup conditions. Repeating the reaction but maintaining
the reaction mixture at room temperature during the workup resulted in the high yield (96%)
synthesis of expected product [Me3N(CH2)3NMe3][B5O6(OH)4]2 which after recrystallization at room
temperature from aqueous solution by slow evaporation gave the compound as its hemihydrate,
[Me3N(CH2)3NMe3][B5O6(OH)4]2.0.5H2O (8), as crystals suitable for single-crystal XRD studies.

The pentaborate(1-) salt, [Me3N(CH2)2NMe3][B5O6(OH)4]2, has been previously reported
by us from the ion exchange method from [Me3N(CH2)2NMe3]I2 and B(OH)3 in good (80%)
yield [28]. We now report that the related salt, [Me3N(CH2)2NMe3][B4O5(OH)4].2B(OH)3.2H2O
(9), could be obtained in moderate yield (41%) by crystallization of an aqueous solution
containing a [Me3N(CH2)2NMe3](OH)2/B(OH)3 in a ratio of 1:3. Reactions of the other amines
or [Me3N(CH2)3NMe3](OH)2 with B(OH)3 at this 1:3 ratio were not explored within this study.
Compound 9 contains a tetraborate(2-) rather than a pentaborate(1-) anion, observed for 1–8, and this
anion is drawn schematically in Figure 1(b). Spectroscopic (IR and NMR) and thermal analysis data,
including porosity measurements on materials obtained thermally, for these compounds 1–9 are
described in Section 2.2 and XRD studies on 2, 3, 7, 8 and 9 are described in Section 2.3.
2.2. Thermal Analysis, Porosity Measurements and Spectroscopic Data
Compounds 1–9 gave satisfactory C, H, N (combustion) elemental analysis data and thermal
gravimetric analysis (TGA) data consistent with their formulations. Non-metal cation polyborates
have been previously reported to decompose thermally (in air) to aﬀord glassy B2O3 residues [5,19,29].
This thermal decomposition is usually a two-step processes with the lower temperature step associated
with dehydration and cross-linking of hydroxyl groups of the polyborate anions to give condensed
polyborate salts. The higher temperature step involves oxidation of the cations to aﬀord the glassy
residue. Thus for example, 1, dehydrates to a condensed polyborate, [Me2NH(CH2)2NHMe2][B10O16]
in the temperature range 150–300 ◦C with loss of 4H2O then with oxidation of organic cation to
leave residual 5B2O3 at 300–650 ◦C. Compound 9, which is formulated as a tetraborate(2-) salt with
2 interstitial B(OH)3 and 2 interstitial H2O molecules aﬀorded 3B2O3 by a similar two-step process.
Selected samples of 1–6 were either heated to 250 ◦C for 1h (1, 2, 5, 6) or 600 ◦C for 1 h (1–3, 6) to
generate samples approximating to the ′condensed′ borate salt or the ′pyrolysed′ glassy solid that
could be used for porosity measurements by use of the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method [30].
Measured porosities of the thermally treated samples were in the range 0.06–0.94 m2/g indicating that
they were all essentially non-porous and in accord with previous work [31,32].
1H-, 13C- and 11B-NMR spectra were recorded on compounds 1–9 (D2O solvent) and 1H- and
13C- spectra were in accord with the cations present. Exchangeable NH and B-OH protons were
absent as speciﬁc signals and it is assumed were observed in the HOD signal present at +4.79 ppm
as has been observed previously in related non-metal cation systems [31–33]. The pentaborate(1-)
anion, although very stable in the solid-state and is readily templated by many organic cations [34],
′decomposes′ in aqueous solution as various equilibrium determined borate species are rapidly
obtained and inﬂuenced by the boron concentration, the temperature and the pH of the aqueous
solution [35,36]. However, 11B spectra of 1–8 were obtained and these samples all showed three
peaks centred at 1 (~5) 13 (~35%) and 18 (~60%) ppm in a pattern typical of solutions arising
from pentaborate(1-) salts [31–34,37]. The 11B spectra of 9, originating from a tetraborate(2-) salt,
was signiﬁcantly diﬀerent with three peaks now at 1.3 (5%), 7.4 (43%) and 11.7 (52%).The upﬁeld shift
of the ‘average’ 11B chemical shift on going from a pentaborate (1-) anion (1–8) to a tetraborate(2-)
anion (9) is in accord with the average B/charge ratio changing from 5:1 to 2:1 [34].
IR spectra were obtained on all compounds and strong B-O stretches in the ﬁngerprint region
1450–650 cm−1 are readily observed [38]. A band assigned to an asymmetric B-O stretch associated with
the tetrahedral boron centre at ~925 cm−1 and usually diagnostic of a pentaborate(1-) anion [30,39] was
clearly evident in samples 1–8. There are many fewer reports of IR spectra of tetraborate(2-) species
and some have been tabulated [38] but diagnostic bands have not been reported. It should be noted
that the tetraborate(2-) salt 9 also displayed a stretch at 927 cm−1 in the region considered diagnostic
for a pentaborate(1-) salt.

2.3. Single-Crystal XRD Studies
Compounds 2, 3, 7, 8 and 9 have been investigated by single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction studies and
pertinent crystallographic data are given in the experimental section, with full details available in the
Supplementary Material. These studies conﬁrm their formulation based on spectroscopic, thermal and
analytical data described in Section 2.2. All structures were ionic and comprised of the expected organic
cations for 2, 3, 8 and 9, or the cation for 7 arising through the Hofmann elimination, with associated
polyborate anions.
Compounds 2, 3, 7, and 8 all contain the insular pentaborate(1-) anion, [B5O6(OH)4]−. Compound 8
is co-crystallized with 0.5 molecules of H2O. There is some disorder present in the cation and/or
co-crystallized molecules all pentaborate(1-) anion structures except 3. Bond lengths and bond
angles found for C, N atoms within the organic cations [19,28,37,40,41] are as expected as are the
B-O bond lengths, OBO and BOB angles observed for the [B5O6(OH)4]−anion [19,21,28,29,31–35];
for full details see the Supplementary Information. H-bonding interactions within polyborate salts
are extremely common and anion-anion interactions between pentaborate(1-) units, forming giant
lattices, are well documented and are signaled as a strong driving force [5,29,34] in templating the
crystallization of these anions from the Dynamic Combinatorial Library [42–45] arising from B(OH)3
under basic conditions [35,36]. The pentaborate (1-) anions in 2, 3, 7, and 8 all form multiple anion-anion
interactions and 2 and 3 have additional cation-anion NH . . . O H-bond interactions. The acceptor sites
for the four anion-anion H-bond interactions from each independent pentaborate(1-) anion can be
codiﬁed [19,37] as α,β,α,α and α,α,α,β (two independent anions) for 2, α,α,α,γ for 3, α,β,α,α for 7,
and α,β,α,α and α,α,β,α (two independent anions) for 8. Using Etter nomenclature [46] the H-bond
interactions per pentaborate are 3 R22(8) and 1 R22(12) for 2, and 3 R22(8) and 1 C(8) for 3, 7, and
8. Compound 7 adopts the familiar ′herringbone′ structure [29,31] whereas 2, 3 and 8 are unique.
The structure of 3 (Figure 2) is similar to the ′stepped brickwall′ structure observed in [4-MepyH,
4-Mepy][B5O6(OH)4] [37]; however the structures are diﬀerent since 3 has a C(8) interaction involving
γ acceptor sites rather than β sites. Views of the anion giant structures in 2 and 8 are given in Figures 3
and 4 respectively.

The C(8) Interaction (not shown) links these planes.
The structural characterization of 9 is considered in more detail in this manuscript since it contains
a tetraborate(2-) anion and there are far fewer crystallographic reports in the literature featuring this
anion; the anion is found partnered with 2Na+ in the well-known borax [47,48] but is less commonly
found with non-metal cation [40,49–52] or transition metal cation salts [53–56].
The tetraborate(2-) anion in 9 is found co-crystallized with 2B(OH)3 and 2H2O and the dication
[Me3N(CH2)2NMe3]2+. The structure is disordered with the cation occupying three closely related
positions with site occupancies of 47.4%, 28.7% and 23.9% and one of the two co-crystallized B(OH)3
units occupying 2 positions with site occupancies of 76% and 24%. A drawing of the atomic labelling
Molecules 2020, 25, 53

for the components of highest site occupancy is given in Figure 5. Bond lengths and bond angles found
for C, N atoms within the [Me3N(CH2)2NMe3]2+ cations are as expected and similar to those reported
for the related pentaborate(1-) salt, [Me3N(CH2)2NMe3][B5O6(OH)4]2. [28]. The B-O bond lengths,
OBO and BOB angles observed for the [B4O5(OH)4]2−and B(OH)3 motifs are in accord with previous
tetraborate(2-) [47–56] and polyborates with co-crystallized B(OH)3 [32,33,39,55,57,58]; for full details
see the Supplementary Information.
Figure 5. Drawing of the structure of 9 showing atomic labelling. Two water molecules (containing
O31 and O32) are omitted for clarity. Compound 9 is disordered and only components with highest
s.o.f are shown.
The tetraborate(2-) anion has four H-bond donor sites and nine potential H bond acceptor
sites, and the B(OH)3 molecules each have three donor and three potential acceptor sites. Again,
there are numerous H-bond interactions within the structure and a giant supramolecular anionic
H-bonded lattice is formed, with cations situated within the cavities. However, there are no direct
anion-anion interactions within the lattice and the B(OH)3 units serve to bridge tetraborate(2-)
anions by acting as ′spacers′ to expand the lattice so that it can accommodate the relatively large
cation, [Me3N(CH2)2NMe3]. This spacer role for B(OH)3 has been observed before [32,33,39,55–58].
With reference to Figure 6 it can be seen that the H-bond structure can be envisaged as ′horizontal′
chains of alternating [B4O5(OH)4]2-/B(OH)3 units held together by R22(8) interaction, crosslinked by
′vertical′ C22(8) chains (involving O8,H8 . . . O12,H12 . . . O5,B1,O2,B3) in a regular 2D arrangement.
These planes are further linked by additional R22(8) interactions into a 3D lattice. Further details of
the interactions around the tetraborate(2-) anion is shown in Figure 7 and full details are available in
the Supplementary Information. The O1 site is a double H-bond acceptor in two R22(8) interactions:
O21H21 . . . O1 and O13H13 . . . O1. The H2O of crystallization further help to H-bond the structure
together. The cation is unable to get involved with H-bonding.

3.11. X-Ray Crystallography
Single-crystal X-ray crystallography (sc-XRD) was undertaken at the EPSRC National
Crystallography Service at the University of Southampton. Selected crystals were mounted on
a MITIGEN holder in perﬂuoroether oil. Suitable crystals of 2, 3 and 8 were placed on a FRE+
instrument Rigaku (Wilmington, MA, USA) equipped with HF Varimax confocal mirrors and an
AFC12 goniometer and HG Saturn 724+ detector diﬀractometer. Suitable crystals of 7 were placed
on a Rigaku 007HF equipped with HF Varimax confocal mirrors and an AFC11 goniometer and
HyPix 6000 detector diﬀractometer. Suitable crystals of 9 were placed on a Rigaku FRE+ equipped
with VHF Varimax confocal mirrors and an AFC12 goniometer and HyPix 6000 diﬀractometer.
The crystals were kept at T = 100(2) K during data collection. The structures were solved with
ShelXT [59] using Olex2 [60].
The models were reﬁned with ShelXL [61] (using Least Squares
minimisation). CCDC: 1968475 (2), 1968476 (3), 1968477 (7), 1968478 (8) and 1968479 (9) contains the
supplementary crystallographic data for this paper. These data can be obtained free of charge via

4. Conclusions
Six new pentaborate(1-) and one new tetraborate(2-) salts were synthesized by templated
crystallization reactions from aqueous solutions containing B(OH)3 and the appropriate C2-linked
or C3-linked bis(alkylammonium)(2+) cations. [Me3NCH2CH=CH2][B5O6(OH)4] was obtained in
addition to [Me3N(CH2)3NMe3][B5O6(OH)4]2.0.5H2O, as a result of a Hofmann elimination during
work up, from the reaction of B(OH)3 with [Me3N(CH2)3NMe3](OH)2 (10:1). All solid-state structures
contain supramolecular H-bonded giant structures with cations situated within the cavities. The R22(8)
H-bonding motif is found to dominate H-bonding interactions within all structures and the role of
B(OH)3 in [Me3N(CH2)2NMe3][B4O5(OH)4].2B(OH)3.2H2O appears to be to expand the lattice in order
to accommodate the large cationic counterion.
