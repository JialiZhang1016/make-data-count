The synthesis of a number of pentaborate(1-) salts from cations arising from N -substituted α,α-, α,β-, and α,γ-diaminoalkanes has been attempted in aqueous solution from B(OH)  3 and the appropriate diammine in a 10:1 ratio. Despite relatively mild work-up conditions the pentaborate(1-) salts prepared were not always as anticipated and the following compounds were isolated in good yield: [Me  2 NH(CH  2 )  2 NHMe  2 ][B  5 O  6 (OH)  4 ]  2 (  1 ), [Et  2 NH(CH  2 )  2 NHEt  2 ][B  5 O  6 (OH)  4 ]  2 (  2 ), [Et  2 NH  2 ][B  5 O  6 (OH)  4 ] (  3 ), [Me  2 NH  2 ][B  5 O  6 (OH)  4 ] (  4 ), [Me  2 NH(CH  2 )  3 NHMe  2 ][B  5 O  6 (OH)  4 ]  2 (  5 ), [Et  2 NH(CH  2 )  3 NHEt  2 ][B  5 O  6 (OH)  4 ]  2 (  6 ), [Me  3 NCH  2 CH=CH  2 ][B  5 O  6 (OH)  4 ] (  7 ), and [Me  3 N(CH  2 )  3 NMe  3 ] [B  5 O  6 (OH)  4 ]  2  . 0.5H  2 O (  8 ). The tetraborate(2-) salt, [Me  3 N(CH  2 )  2 NMe  3 ][B  4 O  5 (OH)  4 ]  . 2B(OH)  3  . 2H  2 O (  9 ) was obtained in moderate yield (41%) from a 3:1 reaction of B(OH)  3 with [Me  3 N(CH  2 )  2 NMe  3 ](OH)  2 . All compounds were characterized by spectroscopy (  1 H,  11 B,  13 C NMR and IR) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). BET analysis on materials derived thermally from selected samples (  1 ,  2 ,  6 ,  7 ) all had porosities of < 1 m  2 /g, demonstrating that they were non-porous. Single-crystal XRD structures were obtained for  2 ,  3 ,  7 ,  8 and  9 and all contain extensive H-bonded polyborate lattices.

Introduction  Salts and neutral species containing polyoxidoborate (polyborate) anions occur as minerals and many synthetic derivatives have now also been prepared [ 1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ]. These compounds are structurally diverse, with the polyborate anions generally comprised of trigonal planar 3-coordinate and tetrahedral 4-coordinate boron centres, linked via oxygen bridges with as many terminal OH or O  − groups as is necessary to complete the required geometry at boron [  6 ,  7 ,  8 ,  9 ,  10 ,  11 ]. Some polyborate salts are sold as bulk chemicals for use in the glass/vitreous, fire retardant, and agricultural industries [  12 ,  13 ,  14 ], whilst other synthetic polyborates have interesting and specialized physical e.g., semiconducting, luminescent, non-linear optical (NLO) properties [  5 ,  15 ]. We are interested in synthetic polyborate chemistry and recently have started to investigate non-metal cation stabilized silicate/borate solutions as potential bio-stimulants for agricultural use [  12 ,  16 ,  17 ]. Since choline-like cations and tetraalkylammonium cations are known to structure-direct silicate species towards cubic octasilicate [Si  8 O  12+n (OH)  8-n ]  n- anions [  18 ,  19 ] our attention has been directed towards  N -substituted aminoalkane and  N -substituted α,ω-diaminoalkane cations. This has led us to investigate, as part of a broader parallel study on synthetic polyborate chemistry, the interaction in aqueous solution between B(OH)  3 and cations derived from  N -substituted α,ω-diaminoalkanes and the results of this investigation are presented in this manuscript. In particular we report herein the synthesis and characterization of seven new polyborate salts together with single-crystal XRD studies on five of these compounds. Schematic drawings of the pentaborate(1-) and tetraborate(2-) anions present in these salts are given in  Figure 1 . Aspects of solid-state H-bond interactions, important in stabilizing the solid-state structures, are also discussed. 

  2. Results and Discussion  2.1. Synthesis  Synthetic strategies to prepare pentaborate(1-) salts partnered with organic cations include the reaction of a free base amine with B(OH) 3 in aqueous solution or use of OH  - activated ion-exchange resins with quaternary ammonium halide salts [  5 ]. Schubert and co-workers [  19 ] have successfully applied the former method to α,ω-diaminoalkanes and have isolated a number of pentaborate(1-) salts containing a +2 diammonium cations of composition [H  3 N(CH  2 )  x NH  3 ][B  5 O  6 (OH)  4 ]  2 (x = 5, 6, 8-12). In this study, the pentaborate(1-) salts [Me  2 NH(CH  2 )  2 NHMe  2 ][B  5 O  6 (OH)  4 ]  2 (  1 ), [Et  2 NH(CH  2 )  2 NHEt  2 ][B  5 O  6 (OH)  4 ]  2 (  2 ), [Et  2 NH  2 ][B  5 O  6 (OH)  4 ] (  3 ), [Me  2 NH  2 ][B  5 O  6 (OH)  4 ] (  4 ), [Me  2 NH(CH  2 )  3 NHMe  2 ][B  5 O  6 (OH)  4 ]  2 (  5 ), and [Et  2 NH(CH  2 )  3 NHEt  2 ][B  5 O  6 (OH)  4 ]  2 (  6 ) were readily prepared as crystalline solids from aqueous solution in yields of 87–99% by the reaction of 10 equivalents of B(OH)  3 with the diaminoalkane in aqueous solution at room temperature. Compounds  2 ,  3 ,  5 and  6 are previously unreported. Compound  1 has recently been prepared serendipitously in low yield (~10%) as a by-product from the reaction of a fluorinated borane CF  3 (CF  2 )  5 CH  2 (OLi)CH  2 PPh  2  . BH  3 with [PtCl  2 (COD)] in the presence of Me  2 N(CH  2 )  2 NMe  2 [  20 ]. Likewise,  4 has been previously obtained in very low yield (a few crystals) as a by-product of a reaction of B(OH)  3 with B  2 (NMe  2 )  4 followed by crystallization from water [  21 ].  N ,  N ,  N ’  N ’-Tetraakyldiaminomethane cations are less stable than the tetrasubstituted diaminoethane or diaminopropane cations in aqueous solution and the formation of the corresponding dialkylammonium pentaborate(1-) salts  3 and  4 in high yields is not unexpected and further demonstrates the ready cleavage of the C-N aminal bonds [  22 ,  23 ,  24 ,  25 ]. Further characterization data for  1 and  4 are reported within this manuscript.  Scheme 1 contains all the reactions studied in this work. 

 The pentaborate(1-) salt [Me 3 NCH  2 CH=CH  2 ][B  5 O  6 (OH)  4 ] (  7 ) was obtained as the isolated product from crystallization of the crude solid sample obtained from the reaction of [Me  3 NCH  2 CH  2 CH  2 NMe  3 ](OH)  2 (from by exchange from [Me  3 N(CH  2 )  3 NMe  3 ]I  2 ) with 10B(OH)  3 followed by removal of the aqueous solvent on a hot water bath and oven drying (65 °C). This product rather than the expected product, [Me  3 N(CH  2 )  3 NMe  3 ][B  5 O  6 (OH)  4 ]  2 was obtained since the [Me  3 N(CH  2 )  3 NMe  3 ]  2+ cation initially present rapidly undergoes a Hofmann elimination [  26 ,  27 ], with elimination of NMe  3 , under the workup conditions. Repeating the reaction but maintaining the reaction mixture at room temperature during the workup resulted in the high yield (96%) synthesis of expected product [Me  3 N(CH  2 )  3 NMe  3 ][B  5 O  6 (OH)  4 ]  2 which after recrystallization at room temperature from aqueous solution by slow evaporation gave the compound as its hemihydrate, [Me  3 N(CH  2 )  3 NMe  3 ][B  5 O  6 (OH)  4 ]  2  . 0.5H  2 O (  8 ), as crystals suitable for single-crystal XRD studies. 

 The pentaborate(1-) salt, [Me 3 N(CH  2 )  2 NMe  3 ][B  5 O  6 (OH)  4 ]  2 , has been previously reported by us from the ion exchange method from [Me  3 N(CH  2 )  2 NMe  3 ]I  2 and B(OH)  3 in good (80%) yield [  28 ]. We now report that the related salt, [Me  3 N(CH  2 )  2 NMe  3 ][B  4 O  5 (OH)  4 ]  . 2B(OH)  3  . 2H  2 O (  9 ), could be obtained in moderate yield (41%) by crystallization of an aqueous solution containing a [Me  3 N(CH  2 )  2 NMe  3 ](OH)  2 /B(OH)  3 in a ratio of 1:3. Reactions of the other amines or [Me  3 N(CH  2 )  3 NMe  3 ](OH)  2 with B(OH)  3 at this 1:3 ratio were not explored within this study. Compound  9 contains a tetraborate(2-) rather than a pentaborate(1-) anion, observed for  1 –  8 , and this anion is drawn schematically in  Figure 1 (b). Spectroscopic (IR and NMR) and thermal analysis data, including porosity measurements on materials obtained thermally, for these compounds  1 –  9 are described in  Section 2.2 and XRD studies on  2 ,  3 ,  7 ,  8 and  9 are described in  Section 2.3 . 

  2.2. Thermal Analysis, Porosity Measurements and Spectroscopic Data  Compounds 1 –  9 gave satisfactory C, H, N (combustion) elemental analysis data and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) data consistent with their formulations. Non-metal cation polyborates have been previously reported to decompose thermally (in air) to afford glassy B  2 O  3 residues [  5 ,  19 ,  29 ]. This thermal decomposition is usually a two-step processes with the lower temperature step associated with dehydration and cross-linking of hydroxyl groups of the polyborate anions to give condensed polyborate salts. The higher temperature step involves oxidation of the cations to afford the glassy residue. Thus for example,  1 , dehydrates to a condensed polyborate, [Me  2 NH(CH  2 )  2 NHMe  2 ][B  10 O  16 ] in the temperature range 150–300 °C with loss of 4H  2 O then with oxidation of organic cation to leave residual 5B  2 O  3 at 300–650 °C. Compound  9 , which is formulated as a tetraborate(2-) salt with 2 interstitial B(OH)  3 and 2 interstitial H  2 O molecules afforded 3B  2 O  3 by a similar two-step process. Selected samples of  1 –  6 were either heated to 250 °C for 1h (  1 ,  2 ,  5 ,  6 ) or 600 °C for 1 h (  1 –  3 ,  6 ) to generate samples approximating to the ′condensed′ borate salt or the ′pyrolysed′ glassy solid that could be used for porosity measurements by use of the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method [  30 ]. Measured porosities of the thermally treated samples were in the range 0.06–0.94 m  2 /g indicating that they were all essentially non-porous and in accord with previous work [  31 ,  32 ]. 

 1 H-,  13 C- and  11 B-NMR spectra were recorded on compounds  1 –  9 (D  2 O solvent) and  1 H- and  13 C- spectra were in accord with the cations present. Exchangeable NH and B-OH protons were absent as specific signals and it is assumed were observed in the HOD signal present at +4.79 ppm as has been observed previously in related non-metal cation systems [  31 ,  32 ,  33 ]. The pentaborate(1-) anion, although very stable in the solid-state and is readily templated by many organic cations [  34 ], ′decomposes′ in aqueous solution as various equilibrium determined borate species are rapidly obtained and influenced by the boron concentration, the temperature and the pH of the aqueous solution [  35 ,  36 ]. However,  11 B spectra of  1 –  8 were obtained and these samples all showed three peaks centred at 1 (~5) 13 (~35%) and 18 (~60%) ppm in a pattern typical of solutions arising from pentaborate(1-) salts [  31 ,  32 ,  33 ,  34 ,  37 ]. The  11 B spectra of  9 , originating from a tetraborate(2-) salt, was significantly different with three peaks now at 1.3 (5%), 7.4 (43%) and 11.7 (52%).The upfield shift of the ‘average’  11 B chemical shift on going from a pentaborate (1-) anion (  1–8 ) to a tetraborate(2-) anion (  9 ) is in accord with the average B/charge ratio changing from 5:1 to 2:1 [  34 ]. 

 IR spectra were obtained on all compounds and strong B-O stretches in the fingerprint region 1450–650 cm −1 are readily observed [  38 ]. A band assigned to an asymmetric B-O stretch associated with the tetrahedral boron centre at ~925 cm  −1 and usually diagnostic of a pentaborate(1-) anion [  30 ,  39 ] was clearly evident in samples  1 –  8 . There are many fewer reports of IR spectra of tetraborate(2-) species and some have been tabulated [  38 ] but diagnostic bands have not been reported. It should be noted that the tetraborate(2-) salt  9 also displayed a stretch at 927 cm  −1 in the region considered diagnostic for a pentaborate(1-) salt. 

  2.3. Single-Crystal XRD Studies  Compounds 2 ,  3 ,  7 ,  8 and  9 have been investigated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies and pertinent crystallographic data are given in the experimental section, with full details available in the  Supplementary Material . These studies confirm their formulation based on spectroscopic, thermal and analytical data described in  Section 2.2 . All structures were ionic and comprised of the expected organic cations for  2 ,  3 ,  8 and  9 , or the cation for  7 arising through the Hofmann elimination, with associated polyborate anions. 

 Compounds 2 ,  3 ,  7 , and  8 all contain the insular pentaborate(1-) anion, [B  5 O  6 (OH)  4 ]  − . Compound  8 is co-crystallized with 0.5 molecules of H  2 O. There is some disorder present in the cation and/or co-crystallized molecules all pentaborate(1-) anion structures except  3 . Bond lengths and bond angles found for C, N atoms within the organic cations [  19 ,  28 ,  37 ,  40 ,  41 ] are as expected as are the B-O bond lengths, OBO and BOB angles observed for the [B  5 O  6 (OH)  4 ]  − anion [  19 ,  21 ,  28 ,  29 ,  31 ,  32 ,  33 ,  34 ,  35 ]; for full details see the  Supplementary Information . H-bonding interactions within polyborate salts are extremely common and anion-anion interactions between pentaborate(1-) units, forming giant lattices, are well documented and are signaled as a strong driving force [  5 ,  29 ,  34 ] in templating the crystallization of these anions from the Dynamic Combinatorial Library [  42 ,  43 ,  44 ,  45 ] arising from B(OH)  3 under basic conditions [  35 ,  36 ]. The pentaborate (1-) anions in  2 ,  3 ,  7 , and  8 all form multiple anion-anion interactions and  2 and  3 have additional cation-anion NH  … O H-bond interactions. The acceptor sites for the four anion-anion H-bond interactions from each independent pentaborate(1-) anion can be codified [  19 ,  37 ] as α,β,α,α and α,α,α,β (two independent anions) for  2 , α,α,α,γ for  3 , α,β,α,α for  7 , and α,β,α,α and α,α,β,α (two independent anions) for  8 . Using Etter nomenclature [  46 ] the H-bond interactions per pentaborate are 3 R  2  2 (8) and 1 R  2  2 (12) for  2 , and 3 R  2  2 (8) and 1 C(8) for  3 ,  7 , and  8 . Compound  7 adopts the familiar ′herringbone′ structure [  29 ,  31 ] whereas  2 ,  3 and  8 are unique. The structure of  3 (  Figure 2 ) is similar to the ′stepped brickwall′ structure observed in [4-MepyH, 4-Mepy][B  5 O  6 (OH)  4 ] [  37 ]; however the structures are different since  3 has a C(8) interaction involving γ acceptor sites rather than β sites. Views of the anion giant structures in  2 and  8 are given in  Figure 3 and  Figure 4 respectively. 

 The structural characterization of 9 is considered in more detail in this manuscript since it contains a tetraborate(2-) anion and there are far fewer crystallographic reports in the literature featuring this anion; the anion is found partnered with 2Na  + in the well-known borax [  47 ,  48 ] but is less commonly found with non-metal cation [  40 ,  49 ,  50 ,  51 ,  52 ] or transition metal cation salts [  53 ,  54 ,  55 ,  56 ]. 

 The tetraborate(2-) anion in 9 is found co-crystallized with 2B(OH)  3 and 2H  2 O and the dication [Me  3 N(CH  2 )  2 NMe  3 ]  2+ . The structure is disordered with the cation occupying three closely related positions with site occupancies of 47.4%, 28.7% and 23.9% and one of the two co-crystallized B(OH)  3 units occupying 2 positions with site occupancies of 76% and 24%. A drawing of the atomic labelling for the components of highest site occupancy is given in  Figure 5 . Bond lengths and bond angles found for C, N atoms within the [Me  3 N(CH  2 )  2 NMe  3 ]  2+ cations are as expected and similar to those reported for the related pentaborate(1-) salt, [Me  3 N(CH  2 )  2 NMe  3 ][B  5 O  6 (OH)  4 ]  2  . [  28 ]. The B-O bond lengths, OBO and BOB angles observed for the [B  4 O  5 (OH)  4 ]  2− and B(OH)  3 motifs are in accord with previous tetraborate(2-) [  47 ,  48 ,  49 ,  50 ,  51 ,  52 ,  53 ,  54 ,  55 ,  56 ] and polyborates with co-crystallized B(OH)  3 [  32 ,  33 ,  39 ,  55 ,  57 ,  58 ]; for full details see the  Supplementary Information . 

 The tetraborate(2-) anion has four H-bond donor sites and nine potential H bond acceptor sites, and the B(OH) 3 molecules each have three donor and three potential acceptor sites. Again, there are numerous H-bond interactions within the structure and a giant supramolecular anionic H-bonded lattice is formed, with cations situated within the cavities. However, there are no direct anion-anion interactions within the lattice and the B(OH)  3 units serve to bridge tetraborate(2-) anions by acting as ′spacers′ to expand the lattice so that it can accommodate the relatively large cation, [Me  3 N(CH  2 )  2 NMe  3 ]. This spacer role for B(OH)  3 has been observed before [  32 ,  33 ,  39 ,  55 ,  56 ,  57 ,  58 ]. With reference to  Figure 6 it can be seen that the H-bond structure can be envisaged as ′horizontal′ chains of alternating [B  4 O  5 (OH)  4 ]  2- /B(OH)  3 units held together by R  2  2 (8) interaction, crosslinked by ′vertical′ C  2  2 (8) chains (involving O8,H8  … O12,H12  … O5,B1,O2,B3) in a regular 2D arrangement. These planes are further linked by additional R  2  2 (8) interactions into a 3D lattice. Further details of the interactions around the tetraborate(2-) anion is shown in  Figure 7 and full details are available in the  Supplementary Information . The O1 site is a double H-bond acceptor in two R  2  2 (8) interactions: O21H21  … O1 and O13H13  … O1. The H  2 O of crystallization further help to H-bond the structure together. The cation is unable to get involved with H-bonding. 

   3. Materials and Methods  3.1. General  All chemicals were obtained commercially. TGA/DSC analysis (in air) were undertaken on an SDT Q600 V4.1 Build 59 instrument (TA Instruments, New Castle, DE, USA) using Al 2 O  3 crucibles, between 10–800 °C (ramp temperature rate of 10 °C min  −1 ).

  3.11. X-Ray Crystallography  Single-crystal X-ray crystallography (sc-XRD) was undertaken at the EPSRC National Crystallography Service at the University of Southampton. Selected crystals were mounted on a MITIGEN holder in perfluoroether oil. Suitable crystals of 2 ,  3 and  8 were placed on a FRE+ instrument Rigaku (Wilmington, MA, USA) equipped with HF Varimax confocal mirrors and an AFC12 goniometer and HG Saturn 724+ detector diffractometer. Suitable crystals of  7 were placed on a Rigaku 007HF equipped with HF Varimax confocal mirrors and an AFC11 goniometer and HyPix 6000 detector diffractometer. Suitable crystals of  9 were placed on a Rigaku FRE+ equipped with VHF Varimax confocal mirrors and an AFC12 goniometer and HyPix 6000 diffractometer. The crystals were kept at  T = 100(2) K during data collection. The structures were solved with ShelXT [  59 ] using Olex2 [  60 ]. The models were refined with ShelXL [  61 ] (using Least Squares minimisation).

   4. Conclusions  Six new pentaborate(1-) and one new tetraborate(2-) salts were synthesized by templated crystallization reactions from aqueous solutions containing B(OH) 3 and the appropriate C  2 -linked or C  3 -linked bis(alkylammonium)(2+) cations. [Me  3 NCH  2 CH=CH  2 ][B  5 O  6 (OH)  4 ] was obtained in addition to [Me  3 N(CH  2 )  3 NMe  3 ][B  5 O  6 (OH)  4 ]  2  . 0.5H  2 O, as a result of a Hofmann elimination during work up, from the reaction of B(OH)  3 with [Me  3 N(CH  2 )  3 NMe  3 ](OH)  2 (10:1). All solid-state structures contain supramolecular H-bonded giant structures with cations situated within the cavities. The R  2  2 (8) H-bonding motif is found to dominate H-bonding interactions within all structures and the role of B(OH)  3 in [Me  3 N(CH  2 )  2 NMe  3 ][B  4 O  5 (OH)  4 ]  . 2B(OH)  3  . 2H  2 O appears to be to expand the lattice in order to accommodate the large cationic counterion.
