Abstract
Background: Anthrax is a zoonotic disease caused by the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus anthracis. In Russia,
there are more than 35 thousand anthrax stationary unfavourable sites. At the same time, there is very little
published information about the isolates of B. anthracis from the territory of Russia. In this study, we report
the use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) and bioinformatics analysis to characterize B. anthracis 81/1
strain isolated in Russia in 1969 from a person during an outbreak of the disease in the Stavropol region.
Results: We used 232 B. anthracis genomes, which are currently available in the GenBank database, to determine the
place of the Russian isolate in the global phylogeny of B. anthracis. The studied strain was characterized by PCR-based
genetic methods, such as Multiple-Locus Variable-Number Tandem Repeat Analysis (MLVA), canonical single nucleotide
polymorphisms (canSNP), as well as the method of full-genomic analysis of nucleotide polymorphisms (wgSNP). The
results indicate that the Russian B. anthracis 81/1 strain belongs to Trans-Eurasion (TEA) group, the most
representative in the world.
Conclusions: In this study, the full genomic sequence of virulent B. anthracis strain from Russia was characterized for
the first time. As a result of complex phylogenetic analysis, the place of this isolate was determined in the global
phylogenetic structure of the B. anthracis population, expanding our knowledge of anthrax phylogeography
in Russia.

Background
Anthrax is a particularly dangerous zoonotic disease, the
causative agent of which is an aerobic Gram-positive spore-
forming microorganism Bacillus anthracis. The relevance
of the causative agent of anthrax increased significantly
after its use as an agent of bioterrorism in 2001 [1]. In the
past, the governments of several countries, including the
United States, the United Kingdom and the former Soviet
Union, used B. anthracis to develop and build biological
weapons [2].
In addition to the danger posed by the anthrax patho-
gen as an agent of bioterrorism, there are other pressing
problems associated with anthrax in wildlife, livestock
and humans [3]. Wild and domestic herbivorous mam-
mals that ingest or inhale the spores of the pathogen
during grazing are most often exposed to anthrax. Hu-
man infection usually occurs through contact with dis-
eased animals and raw materials of animal origin or
consumption of infected products. In recent years, a
new form of anthrax infection, called injectional anthrax,
caused by heroin contaminated with anthrax spore,

emerged [4]. Annually, between 20.000 and 100.000
cases of anthrax are reported worldwide [5]. The most
endemic regions are the countries of sub-Sahara Africa,
Central Asia, the Middle East and South America [6, 7].
Nowadays there are more than 35 thousand so-called
anthrax stationary unfavourable sites in Russia. Accord-
ing to Cherkasskiy, Russian definition of stationary un-
favourable site (place, point or spot) is: rural inhabited
place (settlement or village) or part of area, etc. where
one or more incidents of anthrax in animals and/or
humans was registered independent of the scarcity of
their occurrence [8, 9]. The largest number of cases of
the disease is recorded in the administrative territories
of Siberia and southern Russia [10].
B. anthracis 81/1 strain was isolated from a cutaneous
lesion of a person infected with anthrax while slaughter-
ing of an ill cow during an outbreak of anthrax in live-
stock at Rasshevatskoye village in Novoalexandrovskiy
district of Stavropol Territory in 1969. Anthrax in this
stationary unfavourable site was registered in human
and livestock twelve times since 1935.
The development of next generation sequencing (NGS)
technologies has allowed significant progress in studying
the population structure and evolution of the B. anthracis
isolates. In contrast to taxonomic informative or canonical
SNP-based approaches, sequencing of entire genomes is a
reliable method for resolving intraspecific relationships.
CanSNP-typing and comparison of the complete genomes
of several strains is now becoming the reference method
of B. anthracis genotyping [11, 12].
There is very little published information in inter-
national databases about the B. anthracis strains iso-
lated
on
the
territory
of
Russia.
In
the
most
comprehensive GenBank database, where the genome-
wide sequences of more than 200 B.anthracis strains
from different geographical regions of the world are
stored, the genomes of isolates from Russia are repre-
sented by only three B. anthracis Tsiankovskii-I, B.
anthracis STI-1 and B. anthracis 55-VNIIVViM vac-
cine strains. The only genome of the virulent strain
from Russia described in the international scientific
literature is the genome of the strain that caused the
outbreak of anthrax in 1979 in Sverdlovsk, data on
which was obtained by analyzing DNA extracted from
two samples of autopsy material [13–16].
Current understanding of the genetic structure of the
global population of the anthrax pathogen must be sup-
plemented by clarifying the place of other strains of Rus-
sian origin, including virulent ones. In this study, we
describe the complete sequence of the genome of B.
anthracis 81/1, isolated from a person during an anthrax
outbreak in southern Russia. We used the canSNP and
MLVA genotyping methods, as well as whole-genome
SNP analysis (wgSNP) to determine the phylogenetic
location of the Russian isolate in the global population
of B. anthracis.
Results
General genome characteristics of B. anthracis 81/1
isolate
The total length of the genomic sequence for B. anthracis
81/1 was 98.88% (5.442.544 bp) compared to the reference
genome Ames Ancestor. GC-content of 81/1 was 35.09%,
which is fairly close to that of the reference Ames Ancestor
strain (35.24%). Annotation of the genome was performed
using the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline.
A total of 5.798 genes encoding proteins were predicted;
for 5.157 genes (88,9% of the total number of predicted
genes) predictable functions were determined. This Whole
Genome Shotgun project has been deposited at GenBank
under the accession RQWM00000000. The version de-
scribed in this paper is version RQWM01000000.
PCR-based genotyping of B. anthracis 81/1 isolate
To identify possible close relatives of the Russian
isolate, we performed a canSNP analysis and MLVA-
31
of
isolate
B.
anthracis
81/1
as
described
in
Methods. We selected for comparison 23 genomes
for which we were able to get MLVA-31 profiles in
the MLVAbank for microbes genotyping database
[17], as well as 35 genomes from the GenBank data-
base, for which it was possible to conduct MLVA-31
and canSNP analysis in silico, using an online re-
source MicrobesGenotyping [18]. Genotyping based
on canSNP analysis distributes the studied strains
into 11 canSNP groups (Fig. 1). The phylogenetic re-
lationships between 58 B. anthracis strains were in-
ferred by the Tamura 3-parameter model. It is noted
that 39 strains belong to the main genetic line A, in
which the most representative is subgroup A.Br.008/
009 (11 strains). Strain B. anthracis 81/1 is included
in this subgroup, along with three other strains of
Russian
origin
(STI-1,
Tsiankovskii-1
and
55VNIIVViM). In the subgroup A.Br.008/009 there
are also strains isolated in Italy, France, Turkey,
Pakistan, China and Argentina. This subgroup is
dominant in Europe and accounts for a significant
share of Asian isolates. Table S1 (see Additional file 1)
lists canSNP profiles for 58 strains of B. anthracis.
We used data on the number of repeats in the 31
VNTR locus for phylogenetic reconstruction. Thus, we
were able to estimate the MLVA similarity between the
Russian strain and other strains of different geographical
origin. Visualization of the minimum spanning tree
based on the number of tandem repeats using the cat-
egorical distance coefficient, is shown in Fig. S1 (see
Additional file 2). In Table S2 (see Additional file 3) we
give MLVA-31 profiles for B. anthracis 81/1 strain and

57 other strains B. anthracis. MLVA-31 identifies 54 dif-
ferent genotypes in 58 B. anthracis strains. There are
three main genetic lines A, B and C, but clustering in
their structure is more detailed and does not fully coin-
cide with the expected results of canSNP-analysis. A
total of 14 clusters are observed, including the main line
C, in which three strains have a different MLVA-31
genotype (Fig. 2). Line A is divided into eight clusters
and three separate branches for strains Sterne, H9401
and K3. Strains Vollum, Vollum 1B, SK-102 and CDC
684 form a single cluster, which corresponds to belong-
ing to the canSNP subgroup A.Br.Vollum (Fig. 2).

Russian strains STI-1, Tsiankovskii-1and 55VNIIVViM
in one of these clusters, and the Russian strain 81/1 - in
another, together with strains Pasteur, 1370 (France) and
1144 (Argentina), Turkey32 (Turkey), PAK-1 (Pakistan).
Global phylogenetic analysis of population B. anthracis
We used the genomic sequence of the isolate B. anthracis
81/1, obtained in this study, and 232 complete genomes B.
anthracis, available in the GenBank international database,
to build a global phylogeny B. anthracis based on SNP ana-
lysis of complete genomes. Detailed information on the ge-
nomes used in the analysis is presented in the Table S3 (see
Additional file 4). Genomes of two strains Bacillus cereus
ATCC14579 (GenBank: GCA_000007825.1) and Bacillus
thuringiensis 97–27 (GenBank: GCA_000008505.1) were
used as an external group. Multiple genome alignment of
235 strains, including external group strains, against the
genome of the reference strain B. anthracis Ames Ancestor
allowed to detect 216.074 SNP. SNP-filtering was perfomed
as described in the Methods section. This helped us to get
12.974 SNP totally (see Additional file 5), allowing to differ-
entiate the studied strains. Fig. S2 (see Additional file 6)
shows a phylogenetic tree describing the phylogenetic

relationships of 233 strains of the species B. anthracis used
in the analysis. As the result of phylogenetic reconstruction,
49 strains appeared to be of species, different from B.
anthracis. The number of SNPs found in these strains is
many times greater than the number of SNPs found in the
rest of the sample strains. These strains included 42 B.
anthracis strains with names AFS0xxxxx, as well as the
strains PFAB2, MCCC 1A02161, N1ZF-2, F34, RIT375,
MCCC 1A01412, L19. It is very unlikely that these isolates
belong to B. anthracis; that is confirmed by the inability to
conduct MLVA and SNP typing, as well as to identify B.
anthracis specific plasmid and chromosomal in silico
markers in all of this strains. External group of B.anthracis
was identified as expected. Taking into account these cir-
cumstances, we performed a second round of genome-wide
SNP analysis, which used only the genomic sequences of
184 strains identified as B. anthracis based on the results of
the first round of SNP analysis of complete genomes. Mul-
tiple genome alignment of 184 strains to the genome of the
reference B. anthracis Ames Ancestor strain revealed 9.371
strain-specific SNPs. SNP filtering was performed as de-
scribed in the section Methods, which allowed to obtain
7.284 SNP totally, which were used for phylogenetic recon-
struction. A detailed description of all SNPs used for phyl-
ogeny reconstruction can be found in the Table S5 (see
Additional file 7). The resulting phylogenetic tree describ-
ing the ratios of 184 strains of B. anthracis, shown in Fig.
S3 [see Additional file 8]. We identified clades of the phylo-
genetic tree in accordance with the scheme proposed by
Sahl et al. [16]. The main genetic line C is formed by five
strains forming one cluster. Two clusters corresponding to
two canSNP subgroups are observed in the main genetic
line B B.Br.CNEVA (9 strains) and B.Br.001/002 (7 strains).
The main genetic line A includes 163 strains in six clusters

corresponding to subgroups Sterne (49 strains), Aust94 (27
strains), V770 (12 strains), Ancient A (4 strains), TEA
Br.008/011 (24 strains), TEA Br.011 (30 strains), Vollum
(17 strains). The Russian strain B. anthracis 81/1 belongs to
cluster TEA Br.008/011, forming together with strains Lar-
isa (Greece), K3974 (Slovakia), Tsiankovskii-1 (Russia),
Cvac82 (China) a separate subcluster. The closest to the
Russian isolate is the B. anthracis K3974 strain isolated in
Slovakia in 1995. Other strains of Russian origin STI1,
55VNIIVViM and STI-1 together with strains from Georgia
are a part of another subcluster. Figure 3 shows a close-up
of a phylogenetic tree describing the cluster TEA structure.
Discussion
The studied strain was characterized with PCR-based
genotyping methods (MLVA andcanSNP) and wgSNP
method. The detected discrepancy between the results
ofcanSNP and MLVA31 analysis may be explained by
the fact that: a) canSNP analysis, unlike MLVA, does not
take into account the sequence variability of plasmid
DNA; b) VNTR loci of plasmid pXO1aat (vntr19 with
repeat unit 3 bp) and of plasmid pXO2at (vntr12 with
repeat unit 2 bp) are variable due to the minimum sizes
of repeats; c) canSNP analyzes thirteen loci with two
possible alleles in comparison to much higher number
analyzed with MLVA31 (i.e. 31 loci with the number of
alleles from 2 to 13); d) B.anthracis SNP-markers have a
mutation rate of about 5 × 10–10 mutations/generation,
but VNTR-markers of MLVA from < 10–5 to > 10–4
(i.e. SNP-markers are evolutionarily more stable than
MLVA-markers and are not susceptible to homoplasy
[2]. The high discriminating ability and mutation rate of
MLVA31 has a downside, since two isolates from the
same outbreak can have a different genotype and can be
regarded as having different origins, and susceptibility to
homoplasia is fraught with an assessment of strains of
different origin with an identical genotype as related. In
this regard, it can be concluded that the SNP analysis of
the entire genome will ensure both the highest discrim-
inating ability and the high probability of accurate

determining the origin of the strain, which are necessary
for the epidemiological investigation of the anthrax
outbreak.
A full-genomic SNP analysis of 233 B. anthracis
strains revealed 49 strains that most likely do not belong
to this species. The phylogenetic conclusion presented
in Fig. S2 suggests that the strains with the names of the
species AFS0xxxxx, as well as the strains PFAB2, MCCC
1A02161, N1ZF-2, F34, RIT375, MCCC 1A01412, L19
were mistakenly referred to B. anthracis. Another argu-
ment in favor of this statement is the number of SNPs
found in these strains compared to strains assigned to
the main genetic lines A, B, and C. For example, for
strains named AFS0xxxxx, the number of SNPs is from
494 to 3.412, for strains PFAB2, MCCC 1A02161, N1ZF-
2, F34, RIT375, MCCC 1A01412, L19, the number of de-
tected SNPs is in the range 652–1.262. In our opinion,
this number of SNPs is too large for strains belonging to
the same species. We conducted a comparative analysis
of these data with the number of SNPs found in the
strains of the external group and the strains relating to
the
main
genetic
line
C.
For
strains
B.
cereus
ATCC14579 and B. thuringiensis 97–27, the number of
SNPs found was 4.943 and 695, respectively, in strains
relating to the main genetic line C, the number of SNPs
ranges from 68 to 78 compared to the genome of the
reference B. anthracis Ames Ancestor strain. In our
opinion, the number of detected SNPs is highly corre-
lated with the results of similar experiments [19–21].
According to information from the GenBank inter-
national
database,
isolates
with
species
names
AFS0xxxxx were isolated from soil and plants in the
USA, MCCC 1A02161, N1ZF-2, MCCC 1A01412 and
L19 isolates were isolated from sediments in the South
China Sea, RIT375 was isolated from Costus igneus stem
tissue in Puerto Rico; strains F34 and PFAB2 were iso-
lated from the water of a salt lake in Algeria and a hot
spring in India, respectively. With the exception of soil,
all these sources of isolation should be attributed to the
exotic. We have checked genomes of these strains for
specific and validated chromosomal markers as well as
plasmid markers for B. anthracis including PL3 gene
and dhp61 gene [22–24]. None of them show significant
matches in any genomes. In addition, these strains are
distinguished by a low symmetrical identity relative to B.
anthracis Ames Ancestor strain and other B. anthracis
strains (~ 85% and below), whereas for most strains
these indicators were not lower than ~ 97%. The cluster-
ing of these strains may most likely be explained by er-
roneous identification. Unfortunately, we were unable to
find more complete information about these isolates,
which
would
contain
their
phenotypic
description,
canSNP or MLVA-analysis, and could reliably determine
the species identity of the isolates.
The global phylogeny of 184 B. anthracis strains, built
on the basis of the wgSNP analysis, is fully consistent
with the accepted idea of the global genetic structure of
the anthrax microbe population. Most recent phylogeny
based upon this analysis defined three major subclades
(A, B and C) with major polytomy named Trans-Eura-
sion group (TEA) in clade A. tea subdivided into
TEABr.008/011 (or A.Br.008/011) and TEABr.011 (or
A.Br.011) subgroups [16].
The most representative in our study (54 strains) is
TEA group (Fig. 3). The B. anthracis 81/1 strain be-
longs to one of the clades of subgroup TEA008/011,
namely Tsiankovskii. This clade includes the strains
K3974
(Slovakia),
Tsiankovskii-I
(Russia),
Cvac02
(China), and Larissa (Greece). For strains of this
clade, from 206 to 271 SNPs were detected in com-
parison with the genome of the reference strain. In
the work of Sahl et al. (2016), the phylogeny of the
genome of the strain that caused the outbreak of an-
thrax in 1979 in Sverdlovsk also places it in the
Tsiankovskii
clade
along
with
the
Cvac02
strain
(China). Timofeev et al. [25] also placed two Russian
strains isolated in Yakutia into the A.Br.008/011 sub-
group. The closest subcluster Heroin consists of five
strains, three of which were isolated in Asia and two
in Europe. All these strains are associated with an-
thrax outbreak among drug users in Europe. Earlier,
Erin Price and co-authors [26] described the probable
route of the Heroin Ba4599 strain, which caused a
large outbreak of anthrax among heroin users, to
European countries from the Central Asian region.
From 227 to 240 SNPs distinguish the strain of this
subcluster from the genome of the reference strain.
The narrow range of the number of SNPs found in
the strains of this clade indicates a high degree of
their genetic homogeneity. The third subcluster (STI)
includes five strains isolated in Georgia, two vaccine
strains from Russia (STI and 55VNIIVViM) and one
strain from China. Among these strains, from 214 to
227 SNPs have been found in comparison with the
reference, which also indicates a high genetic homo-
geneity of the strains forming the subcluster. The iso-
lates STI-1 and STI1 are laboratory samples of the
acapsular mutant STI-1 isolated by N.N. Ginsburg
from the virulent strain of the causative agent of an-
thrax “Krasnaya Niva”, which became the basis of the
Russian live anthrax vaccine STI for animals and
people. The genome of the STI-1 strain was se-
quenced at the Center for Microbial Genetics and
Genomics,
Northern
Arizona
University
(USA)
in
2016. The genome of the STI1 strain was sequenced
at the Russian Research Anti-Plague Institute Microbe
in 2018. The fourth subcluster (Pasteur) comprises
five strains, two of which were isolated in Bulgaria
Pisarenko et al. BMC Microbiology          (2019) 19:165 
Page 6 of 9
and one in the USA, the origin of two more strains is
unknown. For strains of this subcluster, from 202 to
242 SNPs have been found in comparison with the
genome of the reference strain.
Conclusion
As a result of the study, the full genome of virulent B.
anthracis strain isolated from human in southern Russia
was characterized for the first time. Genotyping of the
isolate, carried out using the canSNP, MLVA31 and
wgSNP methods, made it possible to determine its place
in the global population of the anthrax pathogen. The
results indicate that the B. anthracis 81/1 strain belongs
to the subgroup TEA008/11, also known as the Trans-
Eurasion group, one of the most representative groups
in the world. Our study confirms data on the wide distri-
bution of isolates of this group in Europe, Russia,
Kazakhstan, the Caucasus, and in the eastern provinces
of China [27]. There is some information about the gen-
omic diversity of B. anthracis strains from other Russian
regions. It would be advisable to continue the study of
the genomes of B. anthracis isolates of Russian origin.
Such studies would contribute to extending the differen-
tiation of B. anthracis strains.
Methods
Bacterial strain
The B. anthracis 81/1 strain used in this study was iso-
lated from a person diagnosed with anthrax in Stavropol
Territory during the outbreak in 1969. The strain was
obtained from the State Collection of Pathogenic Micro-
organisms of Stavropol Research Anti-Plague Institute.
The strain was identified using standard biochemical
methods in accordance with the requirements of the
Russian protocols “Procedure for organizing and con-
ducting laboratory diagnostics of anthrax for laboratories
at the territorial, regional and federal levels” (MUK
4.2.2941–11). Cultural, morphological and biochemical
properties of the isolate, as well as the results of tests for
virulence and antimicrobial susceptibility testing are de-
scribed in detail in the text application [see Add-
itional file 9]. Spore suspension in sterile distilled water/
glycerol in sealed ampules was stored in refrigerator at
4 °C before use.
Growth of B. anthracis and extraction of DNA
Vegetative cells of B. anthracis 81/1 strain were cultured
on blood agar, then inactivated by incubating in TE buf-
fer (10,0 Tris-HCl [pH 8,0], 1,0 mM EDTA) at 100°С for
20 min. DNA was isolated as previously described [28].
All manipulations with live B. anthracis 81/1 strains
were performed in a level 3 biosafety laboratory, and the
isolated DNA was sterile-filtered (0.1 μm filter pores,
Merck Millipore, Germany) before it was taken from the
biosafety laboratory level 3. The DNA concentration was
quantified using the Qubit dsDNA HS assay kit (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. DNA preparation was stored at −20 °C until
further use.
Diagnostic real-time PCR for chromosomal and plasmid
markers of B. anthracis
For identification of B. anthracis by real-time PCR, we
used the reagent kit for detecting Bacillus anthracis DNA
in biological material and environmental objects by the
method of PCR with real-time hybridization-fluorescence
detection «Amplisens® Bacillus anthracis-FRT» (Interlab-
service, Russia). Real-time PCR analysis was performed
using Rotor-Gene Q (QIAGEN, Germany).
Analysis of canonical single nucleotide polymorphisms
(canSNPs)
For analysis of canonical SNPs, which form 12 groups
according to the scheme [29], we used an in-house de-
signed PCR kit with real-time detection and fluores-
cently labeled LNA probes, a Rotor-Gene Q instrument
(QIAGEN, Germany) and the corresponding software
Rotor-Gene Q 2.3. Sequences of primers and probes are
listed in Table S6 [see Additional file 10]. Phylogenetic
relationships between 58 strains of B. anthracis were de-
rived in the Mega10 [30] program using the maximum
likelihood method based on the Tamura three-parameter
model [31]. The bootstrap confidence values were gener-
ated using 1,000 permutations.
Multiple locus variable number of tandem repeats
analysis using 31 markers (MLVA-31)
MLVA was performed essentially as described in [32].
Amplification of fragments of 31 marker loci was per-
formed in 7 multiplex PCR. Fragment mixtures were an-
alyzed
on
a
genetic
analyzer
(ABI
3500,
Applied
Biosystems, USA) using Genescan 1200 LIZ (Applied
Biosystems, USA) as size standards. The data were ana-
lysed using the software GeneMapper TM (Applied Bio-
systems,
USA).
The
MLVA31
cluster
analysis
was
performed using BioNumerics version 7.6 software pack-
age (Applied Maths, Belgium). The minimum spanning
tree was built based on the number of tandem repeats
using the categorical distance coefficient.
DNA library preparation and whole genome sequencing
We used the methodology previously described by Pisar-
enko et al. [33]. The preparation of a genomic library
with a 400-bp read length was performed using the Ion
Xpress Plus Fragment Library Kit reagent kit (Life Tech-
nologies, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer’s
protocol. DNA library fragments were separated using a
ready-to-use commercial kit 2% E-Gel SizeSelect agarose

gel (Invitrogen, USA). The finished library of DNA frag-
ments was purified using Agencourt AMPure XP mag-
netic particles (Beckman Coulter, USA). Library quality
and concentration were determined using the Experion™
Automated Electrophoresis System and Experion DNA
1 K Reagents and Supplies and Experion DNA Chips kits
(Bio-Rad, USA). Monoclonal amplification on micro-
spheres was performed using Ion PGM Hi-Q View OT2
Kit reagents (Life Technologies, USA) in accordance
with the manufacturer’s protocol. Microsphere enrich-
ment was performed using Dynabeads MyOne Streptavi-
din C1 magnetic particles (Invitrogen, Life Technologies,
USA). The effectiveness of the enrichment process was
evaluated using the Ion Sphere Quality Control Kit (Life
Technologies, USA). Genome sequencing was performed
using an Ion Torrent PGM sequencer and Ion 316 Chips
Kit V2 chips (Life Technologies, USA).
Post-sequencing data processing
The quality assessment of the obtained reads was per-
formed using the FastQC version 0.11.3 program [34].
Reads with an average value of quality Q < 20, as well as
reads with a length of less than 75 nucleotides were re-
moved in the Trimmomatic version 0.33 program [35].
The genomes were assembled using the Newbler v 3.0
software (Roche, Switzerland), the extent of the genome
coverage was more than 80×. Assessment of the quality
of genome assembly was performed using the program
Quast 5.0 [36], the genomic sequence of B. anthracis
Ames Ancestor strain (GeneBank: NC_007530.2, NC_
007322.2, NC_007323.3) was used as a reference to as-
sess the accuracy and efficiency of the genomic project
assembly. Genome annotation was performed using the
NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline.
Whole genome SNP analysis
We used the Parsnp tool from the Harvest Suite soft-
ware for fast multiple alignment of genomic sequences
[37]. As input, we used the genome of the strain se-
quenced by us and the genomic sequences of B. anthra-
cis strains from the GenBank public database (see
Additional file 4), which were aligned to the chromo-
somal nucleotide sequence of the reference genome of
B. anthracis Ames Ancestor (GeneBank: NC_007530.2)
using Parsnp (parameters -c -e -u -C 1000). The de-
tected SNPs were extracted to a VCF file, using Harvest-
Tools (version 1.0) from the same software package. To
improve the overall quality of the data, SNP positions
with a distance of less than 10 bp, as well as positions
that carry an unspecified nucleotide (“N”) were removed.
The edited file was used as an input file in HarvestTools
to compile the FASTA file. Phylogenetic reconstruction
was built in Mega10 using the maximum likelihood
method (the Maximum Likelihood method) according to
the Tamura-Nei model [38]. The bootstrap confidence
values were generated using 1.000 permutations.
