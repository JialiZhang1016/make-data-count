1.  Introduction
Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) is a key component of the climate system, as it transfers 
heat from the Southern Hemisphere to the Northern Hemisphere. It has been implicated in the global expression 
of climate change, by forcing a “bipolar seesaw” of hemispheric temperatures (Broecker, 1998; Rahmstorf, 2002) 
and via processes that force shifts in the mean position of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and monsoons 
(Chiang & Bitz, 2005; Vellinga & Wood, 2002; Zhang & Delworth, 2005). Additionally, AMOC transports heat 
and carbon from the surface to the interior ocean (Kostov et al., 2014; Marshall et al., 2014), and may help deter-
mine the pace and patterns of warming due to the release of anthropogenic carbon. Regionally variable wind-
driven processes dominate AMOC variability on intra-annual to interannual timescales (Xu et al., 2014; Zhao & 
Johns, 2014), while buoyancy-driven processes that are more coherent across latitudes play a larger role in forcing 
AMOC variability on decadal and longer timescales (Buckley et al., 2012; Tulloch & Marshall, 2012). Accord-
ingly, modeling and observational studies have found that AMOC is not coherent between the North Atlantic 
subpolar and subtropical gyres on interannual to decadal timescales (Bingham et al., 2007; Lozier et al., 2010; 
Mielke et al., 2013; Williams et al., 2014). However, a model study finds coherent AMOC variability between the 
subtropics and subpolar regions on decadal or longer timescales and we should therefore expect studies of AMOC 
variability from different regions to yield similar results on these longer timescales (Gu et al., 2020).
A decline in AMOC over the industrial era (nineteenth and twentieth centuries) has been inferred from many 
paleoclimate proxy records (Caesar et al., 2021), but the timing of the weakening differs among records (Caesar 
et al., 2018; Lower-Spies et al., 2020; Thornalley et al., 2018), and there are even some records that do not suggest 
a weakening (Lund et al., 2006; Wanamaker et al., 2012). AMOC decline over the late twentieth century has been 
inferred from North Atlantic sea surface temperature data (Rahmstorf et al., 2015), sea-level variations across 
the Florida Current (Piecuch, 2020), and from partial records of circulation and sea surface height (Mercier 
et al., 2015). However, other studies suggest that the sea-surface temperature patterns and sea-level may respond 
to factors other than AMOC (Menary et al., 2020; Piecuch et al., 2016). For recent decades, observational arrays 
that capture continuous measurements of northward and southward flow across the Atlantic basin have come 
Abstract  Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) plays a central role in the global 
redistribution of heat and precipitation during both abrupt and longer-term climate shifts. Over the next 
century, AMOC is projected to weaken due to greenhouse gas warming, though projecting its future behavior 
is dependent on a better understanding of how AMOC changes are forced. Seeking to resolve an apparent 
contradiction of AMOC trends from paleorecords of the more recent past, we reconstruct seawater cadmium, a 
nutrient-like tracer, in the Florida Straits over the last ∼8,000 years, with emphasis on the last millennium. The 
gradual reduction in seawater Cd over the last 8,000 years could be due to a reduction in AMOC, consistent 
with cooling Northern Hemisphere temperatures and a southward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. 
However, it is difficult to reconcile this finding with evidence for an increase in geostrophic flow through the 
Florida Straits over the same time period. We combine data from intermediate water depth sediment cores to 
extend this record into the Common Era at sufficient resolution to address the broad scale changes of this time 
period. There is a small decline in the Cd concentration in the Late Little Ice Age relative to the Medieval 
Climate Anomaly, but this change was much smaller than the changes observed over the Holocene and on the 
deglaciation. This suggests that any trend in the strength of AMOC over the last millennium must have been 
very subtle.

online (Lozier et al., 2019; Srokosz & Bryden, 2015). A decade of measurements from the RAPID array at 26.5 N 
confirmed an AMOC decline since 2008, though the extent to which this trend is related to Atlantic Multidecadal 
Variability/Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMV/AMO), decadal variability, and anthropogenic warming is 
undiscernible from the abbreviated record (Smeed et al., 2018). Models also project continued AMOC decline 
through 2100, but rates and magnitudes of weakening vary depending on ocean resolution and how the model 
constructs deep convection (IPCC, 2021). In light of the uncertainty around multidecadal AMOC variability and 
projections of future AMOC, paleoceanographic reconstructions seek to place AMOC variability over the last 
decades within the context of past variability.
1.1.  Holocene AMOC Variability
In the Northern Hemisphere, Holocene climate has been largely stable relative to the preceding deglacial period. 
The most notable temperature features over the last ∼11,700 years are an abrupt and transient cooling near 8.2 
ka (Rohling & Pälike, 2005) and gradual cooling from the climate optimum around 6–8 ka until the modern 
period (Kaufman et al., 2020). Both features are much smaller in magnitude than abrupt changes observed during 
the last deglaciation. It is thought that the transient cooling at 8.2 ka is due to a weakening of AMOC (Barber 
et al., 1999). It is still debated whether the cooling trend over the Holocene is global in extent, and the magni-
tude of cooling in the Northern Hemisphere varies considerably among reconstructions (e.g., Bader et al., 2020; 
Kaufman et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2014; Marcott et al., 2013; Marsicek et al., 2018). It is also unclear how AMOC 
changed along with the apparent Northern Hemisphere cooling over the Holocene. While records suggest a 
weakening of the Iceland-Scotland Overflow, one component of North Atlantic Deepwater (NADW), over the 
last ∼8 ka (Hoogakker et al., 2011; Kissel et al., 2009; Thornalley et al., 2013), several other records based on Pa 
and Th measurements are interpreted to represent no trend in overall AMOC strength for example, (Hoffmann 
et al., 2018; Lippold et al., 2019).
Attempts to characterize AMOC variability in the pre-modern Common Era have also yielded mixed findings. 
While the warm Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA; ∼950–1300 CE) and the cool Little Ice Age (LIA, ∼1300–
1850 CE) were first identified in Europe, much of the North Atlantic cools from the MCA to the LIA (Moffa-
Sánchez et al., 2019), suggesting the possibility that this represented a transition from strong to weak AMOC. 
Lund et al. (2006) applied the geostrophic method using benthic δ 18O measurements to estimate Gulf Stream 
transport in the Florida Straits, a component of upper branch AMOC. They estimated that this transport was 
10% weaker during the LIA than during the MCA. The interpretation that the lower LIA Florida Straits transport 
was due to a weaker AMOC was supported by a reconstruction of surface ocean radiocarbon north of Iceland 
(Wanamaker et al., 2012). However sortable silt records, which record the strength of key deep-sea AMOC 
components, show considerable regional variability, and do not show a coherent trend from the MCA to the LIA 
(Moffa-Sánchez et al., 2019).
1.2.  Florida Straits Nutrients and AMOC
The 32 Sv of western boundary flow carried by the Florida Current transports both the surface branch of the 
AMOC (17 Sv), and the western limb of the subtropical gyre (15 Sv; Szuts & Meinen, 2017). The densest waters 
(σθ > ∼27 kg m −3) that transit through the Florida Straits constitute part (4–5 Sv) of the upper branch of the 
AMOC (Schmitz & Richardson, 1991) and are composed of fresh, higher nutrient Antarctic Intermediate Waters 
from the South Atlantic (Palter & Lozier, 2008) significantly diluted by saltier, lower nutrient waters by the time 
they reach the Florida Straits. The high nutrient content of the southern sourced waters reflects both high initial 
nutrient content of Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) and additional nutrients gained from remineralization 
of organic matter as these waters pass through the tropics. Because of the strong tilt of isopycnals associated 
with the Florida Current, these densest high-nutrient waters are concentrated on the landward side of the Straits 
(Figure 1). This nutrient transport into the North Atlantic associated with the upper branch of the AMOC has 
been termed “the nutrient stream” and feeds marine productivity in the North Atlantic (Williams et al., 2006).
We would expect a decrease in nutrient content in the denser levels of the Florida Straits with a weakening 
of AMOC, as the contribution of northern-sourced gyre waters increases relative to southern-sourced water, 
and conversely an increase in nutrients with a stronger AMOC. Models show that projected future decreases in 
AMOC are accompanied by a decrease of nutrient transport into the North Atlantic, with a reduction of both

the nutrient concentration and volumetric flux in the densest levels of the 
Florida Straits (Tagklis et al., 2020; Whitt, 2019). We can get a sense of the 
scaling between nutrient changes in the Florida Straits and the strength of 
AMOC on a century timescale from a modeling study examining the changes 
in the nutrient stream projected to 2080 under the RCP8.5 global warming 
scenario (Whitt, 2019). In this study there was a reduction of norward volume 
transport by the Gulf Stream at 30.5 N (just north of the Florida Straits) of 
22% (8 Sv) and a 35% reduction in nitrate transport. This corresponds to 
a 17% reduction in nitrate concentration. Because the import of nutrients 
along the western boundary currents is a dominantly advective phenomenon, 
the response in the nutrients to an increase in flow should be very rapid. 
Indeed, Carracedo et al. (2021) find that on interannual timescales the nutri-
ent content and flow in the densest layers of the Florida Current are positively 
correlated. However, because the Florida Straits transport will only be coher-
ent with AMOC variability on decadal or longer timescales (Gu et al., 2020), 
it would be unwise to interpret nutrient variability on shorter timescales in 
terms of AMOC changes.
Given the link between nutrient transport into the North Atlantic and AMOC, 
Cd/Ca measurements in benthic foraminifera have been used to reconstruct 
the nutrient tracer seawater Cd (Cdw) in order to qualitatively infer past vari-
ability in AMOC (as in Came et al., 2008; Poggemann et al., 2017; Valley 
et al., 2017, 2019). Other tracers, such as Nd isotopes, which distinguish 
AAIW from northern sourced intermediate water, have also been used for 
qualitative reconstructions of AMOC variability (Huang et  al.,  2014; Xie 
et al., 2012). In a transient model study, Gu et al. (2017) show that the north-
ward penetration of AAIW varies coherently with AMOC over the deglaci-
ation. In this study, we investigate how Cdw has changed along the  Florida 
Margin over the mid to late Holocene, with particular focus on the last 
∼1,000 years, and discuss the implications for changes in AMOC over this 
time period.
2.  Methods
Four of the Florida Straits cores included in the Lund et  al.,  2006 study 
were analyzed for trace and minor metal content (Table 1; Figure 2). The 
selected cores were retrieved from 447 to 751 m water depth on the Florida 
margin and the core sites are today bathed with the high nutrient AAIW. 
Radiocarbon measurements indicate that each core has a modern core top; 
age models are applied as in previous studies (Lund et al., 2006; Lund & 
Curry, 2004, 2006), but raw  14C values are converted to calendar ages using 
CALIB 8.2 and the Marine20 calibration curve (Heaton et al., 2020). The 
cores had sedimentation rates ranging from 10 to 40 cm kyr −1, and were 
sampled at 1 cm increments (30–90 years nominal time resolution), however 
the actual resolution of our composite record is diminished by bioturbation 
and age model uncertainty.
Cd/Ca, Mg/Ca, and Li/Ca were measured in the tests of the benthic foraminifer 
Hoeglundina elegans, after cleaning using the reductive and oxidative proce-
dures outlined by Boyle and Keigwin (Boyle & Keigwin, 1985) and modified 
by Boyle and Rosenthal (1996). We analyzed 1–20 > 250 μm foraminifera 
per sample (samples containing more than 10 foraminifera were homoge-
nized and split before cleaning, then analyzed separately as replicates) on a Thermo Element2 sector field induc-
tively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) using the methods of Rosenthal et al. (1999) and T. M.

Marchitto (2006). Analytical precision (1σ) is 2% for Cd/Ca, 0.5% for Mg/
Ca, and 0.9% for Li/Ca (Bryan & Marchitto, 2008).
As the partitioning of Cd in H. elegans is not strongly depth dependent, 
Cdw was calculated from Cd/Ca using a partition coefficient of 1 (Boyle 
et al., 1995) and an assumed global mean seawater Ca concentration 0.01 mol 
kg −1 (Boyle, 1992).
Because of the scarcity of Common Era samples, Cdw data from the four 
cores are combined to create a composite record. Over the depth range that 
includes the cores in this study, modern phosphate varies by approximately 
0.20 μmol kg −1 (J. Zhang et al., 2017), equivalent to an estimated range of 
0.08 nmol kg −1 of Cdw. There are no systematic offsets in the Cdw records 
by depth (Figure S1 in Supporting Information S1). Measurements from the 
individual cores are binned and averaged at 50-year intervals (Figure 4).
Of 180 samples analyzed (including replicates), 11 Mg/Li ratios are discarded due to Li contamination in the 
acid used to dissolve the foraminifera. In addition, 13 Cdw and 13 Mg/Li temperature data points are excluded

method and 10% data smoothing window. Data beyond 2σ of the smoothed time series were marked as outliers.
Temperatures were reconstructed from Mg/Li ratios using the empirically derived polynomial calibration equa-
tion for H. elegans:


(T. M. Marchitto et al., 2018). The equation's fit corresponds to r 2 = 0.95, and the 1σ standard error of estimate 
for Mg/Li is 0.022 mol mmol −1, equivalent to ±1.0°C at 0°C and ±1.7°C at 20°C.
Published Cd/Ca and Mg/Li records from the same region (Valley et al., 2017, 2019; Figure S2 in Supporting 
Information S1) provide a longer-term framework for our new Common Era records. Previous work focused on 
deglacial changes; here we discuss Holocene trends and variability to contextualize our new records.
3.  Results and Discussion
3.1.  Mid-late Holocene
Cdw derived from the Florida Straits KNR166-2 26JPC core (547 m) peaks around 8 ka (Figure 3). Thereafter, the 
decay of the North American and European ice sheets plays a lesser role in climate variability relative to the last 
deglaciation, and this portion of the Holocene is the focus of our analysis. One of the most noted events in North-
ern Hemisphere Holocene climate is an abrupt and brief (∼200 years) incidence of Greenland cooling around 
8.2 ka (Alley et al., 1997; Thomas et al., 2007). There is no indication of lower Cdw that would be expected for 
a brief period of substantially weakened AMOC. Instead, the amplitude of variability near 8.2 ka is not distinct 
from the general variability of Cdw in our record. However, given our record's ∼80-year time resolution at this 
core section and the presence of bioturbation, it is not clear that such a brief decrease in Cdw would have been 
recorded. However, the lack of an 8.2 ka signal is in line with Lippold et al. (2019) and Hoffmann et al. (2018) 
who also failed to see evidence in Bermuda Rise and Carolina Slope sedimentary records for an AMOC weak-
ening at 8.2 ka.
The most evident trend in mid-late Holocene Cdw is a gradual decline from a 300-year average of 0.47 ± 0.03 nmol 
kg −1 (reported errors are 2σ standard error on the mean, unless otherwise indicated) near 8.2 ka to an average of 
0.36 ± 0.05 mol kg −1 around 510 BP, the most recent 300-year period in the record. Such a gradual change in 
nutrient content of the deep Florida Straits could reflect changes in the nutrient content of the northern and/or 
southern sourced intermediate waters, as well as the mixture between the two. A southern hemisphere record of 
AAIW does suggest a small (<0.05 nmol kg −1) decline in Cdw over the last 8 ka (Umling et al., 2019), which is 
not enough to account for the decline we see in the Florida Straits. However, since the AAIW gains considerable 
amount of nutrients in the tropics, probably a more relevant record is from the Tobago Basin off Venezuela, 
which also shows a slight decline in intermediate water Cdw (Poggemann et al., 2017). There are two records 
from the Bahamas on the seaward (subtropical gyre) side of the Florida Current (Came et al., 2008; T. Marchitto 
et al., 1998) that are today near the AAIW density level, but are not in the core of AAIW which travels up the 
western boundary and have a much stronger imprint of the Northern Hemisphere end member. The first shows 
no discernible trend over the last 8 ka, and the second shows a slight increase in Cdw over this time period. These 
records suggest that the larger decline in Cdw we observe on the Florida margin reflects, in large part, a decrease 
in the proportion of southern versus northern sourced intermediate waters rather than end member changes.
The simplest explanation for the decline in Cdw at AAIW levels in the Florida Straits is that the contribution of 
Southern sourced intermediate waters has declined with time, and that this reflects a decrease in the import of 
these intermediate waters into the northern hemisphere as part of the upper branch of AMOC. This explanation 
would seem in conflict with geostrophic transport estimates through the Florida Straits which suggest an increase 
in upper-level Florida Current flow over the Holocene (Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 2009). However, this increase 
has been interpreted as likely reflecting an increase in the wind driven gyre flow through the straits. The wind 
driven gyre flow is primarily carried above AAIW density layer (e.g., Szuts & Meinen, 2017), and the change in 
geostrophic transport is found in the upper layers, driven by the changes in density on the gyre side of the Florida 
Current. Given the scaling between nutrient concentration and AMOC flow from the climate models, we would 
suggest a substantial AMOC reduction on the basis of the magnitude in the reduction in Cdw. To reconcile the

geostrophic transport estimate with the inference of a weakening AMOC from the Cdw, the increase in wind 
driven flow would have to more than compensate to result in a strengthening of total flow of the Florida Current 
over the Holocene. It is also possible that since only 4.5 of the 17 Sv passing through the Florida Straits that 
constitutes the upper branch of the AMOC is represented in the AAIW density layer, the Holocene decrease in 
this denser component of the upper branch of the return flow implied by the decline in nutrient concentrations

was compensated by an increase in less dense AMOC return flow. It has recently been suggested that a large frac-
tion of the surface return flow bypasses the Florida Straits today (Drouin et al., 2022), so perhaps an even larger 
fraction of these surface waters bypassed the Straits in the mid-Holocene. Another possible explanation for the 
discrepancy is that the assumption in the geostrophic transport estimate that the bottom velocity was as weak as 
today over the entire 8 kyr time period is incorrect. Since we do not have enough evidence to provide a unique, 
consistent explanation of both data sets, the interpretation of a gradual decline in AMOC over the Holocene based 
on the Cdw record should be viewed as provisional.
The inferred gradual AMOC decline from the Florida Straits Cdw record is consistent with several records of 
a ∼7 kyr progressive decline in Iceland Scotland overflow (Hoogakker et al., 2011; Kissel et al., 2009; Kissel 
et al., 2013; Thornalley et al., 2013), one component of NADW. However, other studies from the high latitude 
North Atlantic and the Bermuda Rise instead find centennial variability but no large-scale trends in AMOC or 
NADW components (Figure 3c: Hoffmann et al., 2018; Keigwin & Boyle, 2000; Lippold et al., 2019; McManus 
et al., 2004; Mjell et al., 2015), and a study from the South Atlantic finds evidence of enhanced AAIW in the late 
Holocene relative to the mid Holocene (Voigt et al., 2016).
The implied long-term reduction in the incursion of AAIW into the North Atlantic as part of the upper branch of 
the AMOC took place as temperatures in the extratropical Northern hemisphere appear to have declined, with an 
average temperature decrease of 2°C between 7 ka and 100 years BP (Marcott et al., 2013). Large-scale change in 
Florida Straits Cdw over the last 8,000 years also parallels evidence of ITCZ migration over the same period. The 
ITCZ shifted progressively southward after the Holocene Thermal Maximum around 7–9 ka, as inferred from 
precipitation change near the Cariaco Basin in South America and the Dongge Cave in China (Haug et al., 2001; 
Wang et al., 2005, Figure 3). Cooling temperatures in the mid to late Holocene and the southward ITCZ migration 
have been attributed to declining Northern Hemisphere summer insolation (Wanner et al., 2008) and correspond-
ing snow-ice albedo and vegetation feedbacks (Marcott et al., 2013). However, changes in mean annual ITCZ 
position can also reflect changes in AMOC's transport of heat north of the equator (Zhang & Delworth, 2005). 
The temporally coherent Florida Straits Cdw decline suggests that a weakening AMOC and the resulting decrease 
of heat transport into the Northern Hemisphere could have provided an additional mechanism for the southward 
ITCZ shift.
3.2.  Common Era
Florida Straits Cdw is stable through the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA; ∼950–1300 CE) and the early LIA, 
with possible lower values in the later LIA (Figure 4). The measurements of Cdw from all four cores averaged 
0.383 ± 0.005 nmol kg −1 over the last 2,000 years. During the MCA Cdw averaged 0.392 ± 0.011 nmol kg −1 and 
it averaged 0.380 ± 0.007 nmol kg −1 over the LIA. The difference between these periods is not statistically signif-
icant (2σ) under a Student's t-test. However, there is a suggestion of lower Cdw during the latter half of the LIA 
(1675–1850 CE), which featured Cdw 0.025 ± 0.020 nmol kg −1 lower than the MCA average, consistent with the 
proxies applied in Thornalley et al. (2018) that indicate the late LIA as a transition period to a weakened indus-
trial era AMOC. Further, the trend of Cdw estimates over the entire period of both the MCA and LIA (950–1850) 
is significant at the 95% level. The idea that this slight trend in Cdw over this time period is due to a weakening 
AMOC is supported by Lund et al. (2006). The surface temperature AMOC index of Rahmstorf et al. (2015), 
instead, does not support a weakening of AMOC over this time period (Figure 4).
As was the case for the longer Holocene records, we have to consider the possibility that changes in the end 
member composition of the southern or northern source waters rather than AMOC changes could have produced 
the late LIA reduction, but in this case we have no other record at similar resolution to help us assess this possi-
bility. However, even if we ascribed all of the observed Cdw variability to changes in AMOC, the magnitude of 
these changes was likely modest. Following the results from the Whitt (2019) modeling study and assuming that 
the reduction in nutrient is proportional to nutrient concentration across the section, one would then expect the 3% 
reduction in Cdw concentration for the LIA relative to the MCA to be associated with a decline in Florida Straits 
Transport of around 4% or 1.4 Sv. This is only slightly smaller than the reduction in transport observed by Lund 
et al. (2006) over the same time period.
During periods of reduced AMOC, intermediate waters along the Florida Margin are expected to warm due to 
the relaxation of the tilted isotherms in this location, or by other mechanisms of subsurface western tropical

Atlantic warming (Valley et al., 2019 and references therein). There is a small but significant (95% confidence, 
students t-test) increase in Mg/Li temperature during the LIA (6.5°C, std. err. 0.06) relative to the MCA (6.2°C, 
std. err. 0.08; Figure S1 in Supporting Information S1). While a 2°C warming was associated with weakened 
Florida Straits transport during the earlier Younger Dryas glacial period, the small change in temperatures in the 
combined Florida Straits Common Era core records underscores the subtlety of any changes in AMOC that may 
have occurred over the last 2,000 years.
4.  Conclusions
If the gradual reduction in Florida Straits Cdw from the mid to late Holocene represents a decline in AMOC, this 
would suggest that the cooling temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere may have, like the dramatic climate 
changes of the deglaciation, been driven at least in part by changes in AMOC-driven oceanic heat transport even 
without the influence meltwater from large ice sheets. It is worth noting that there is still considerable disagree-
ment among proxy records as to the sign and magnitude of trends in AMOC over the Holocene. However, there 
are now multiple lines of evidence suggesting that cooler temperatures in the late Little Ice Age were accom-
panied by a weakening AMOC, even though the timing of transitions into and out of the LIA weakening are 
inconsistent across records. The records presented here from the Florida Straits highlight the subtlety of AMOC 
changes over the LIA and MCA. However, the observations in the paleorecord of a slight reduction in AMOC 
during the transition from the MCA to the LIA in the North Atlantic stand in contrast to the apparent dramatic 
slowdown associated with warming over the Industrial Era (e.g., Caesar et al., 2021). These findings underscore 
the need for greater understanding of AMOC's stability and under what conditions AMOC changes may lead 
or lag shifts in climate. These questions are highly relevant in the current period of warming temperatures and 
changes in buoyancy forcings at high latitudes.
