Obtaining nesting material presents an optimal foraging problem, collection of materials incurs a cost in terms of risk of predation 
and energy spent and individuals must balance these costs with the benefits of using that material in the nest. The hazel dormouse, 
Muscardinus avellanarius is an endangered British mammal in which both sexes build nests. However, whether material used in their 
construction follows the predictions of optimal foraging theory is unknown. Here, we analyze the use of nesting materials in forty two 
breeding nests from six locations in Southwest England. Nests were characterized in terms of which plants were used, the relative 
amount of each plant, and how far away the nearest source was. We found that dormice exhibit a preference for plants closer to the 
nest, but that the distance they are prepared to travel depends on the plant species. Dormice traveled further to collect honeysuckle 
Lonicera periclymenum, oak Quercus robur, and beech Fagus sylvatica than any other plants. Distance did not affect the relative 
amount used, although the proportion of honeysuckle in nests was highest, and more effort was expended collecting honeysuckle, 
beech, bramble Rubus fruticosus and oak compared to other plants. Our results suggest that not all aspects of optimal foraging theory 
apply to nest material collection. However, optimal foraging theory is a useful model to examine nest material collection, providing test-
able predictions. As found previously honeysuckle is important as a nesting material and its presence should be taken account when 
assessing suitability of sites for dormice.

INTRODUCTION
Selection is expected to drive the evolution of foraging mech-
anisms that act to maximize fitness, both in terms of energy ex-
pended per unit gain, and relative risk of predation, that is, optimal 
foraging (Emlen 1966; Stephens and Krebs 1986). This can explain 
selection of food items in terms of which prey to hunt, how far 
to travel to forage, and when to move on from one patch to the 
next (MacArthur and Pianka 1966; Pyke et al. 1977). Central Place 
Foraging Theory (CPFT) makes specific predictions concerning the 
behavior of animals that return to a central place, like a nest or 
cache, after each foraging trip, whereby we expect an additional 
effect of distance from the central place on the size of the load 
brought back from each trip (Orians and Pearson 1979; Schoener 
1979; Kacelnik 1984; Haarberg and Rosell 2006).
Most of optimal foraging theory, including CPFT, and em-
pirical studies testing the theory, have focused on foraging for 
food, but, foraging for nesting material presents a very similar 
problem for an animal; how to get the “best” nesting material 
for the lowest expenditure of energy and minimal risk of preda-
tion (Hansell 2000; Mainwaring and Hartley 2013). While, un-
like with foraging for food, the issue of energy obtained does not 
arise as the material foraged is not consumed, there may be dif-
ferences in the benefits obtained from different nest building ma-
terials (Hansell 2000; Petit et al. 2002; Mainwaring et al. 2014; 
Ruiz-Castellano et al. 2018). Decisions about which nesting mate-
rial to use are therefore likely to depend on; 1) the availability of 
materials in the environment (and the distance to travel in order 
to collect that material), 2) predation risk while collecting, and 3) 
variation in nest material quality (Petit et al. 2002; Mennerat et al. 
2009a; Mainwaring et al. 2014; Bailey et al. 2016). Therefore, as 
for optimal foraging decisions, the relative costs and benefits will 
determine individual decisions on which nesting material to col-
lect, and how much to carry back on each trip (MacArthur and 
Pianka 1966; Metz et al. 2007).
There have been a number of studies, mainly in birds, on what 
makes a “good” nest (Hansell 2000). Important factors in deter-
mining nesting material, placement and overall nest design have

Collins et al. • Nest material preferences in hazel dormice
been identified as: 1) the effect on thermoregulation of adults and/
or offspring (e.g., Hilton et al. 2004; Gedeon et al. 2010; Dawson et 
al. 2011), 2) protection from predators (e.g., Gregoire et al. 2003), 
3) reduction of parasites (e.g., Gwinner et al. 2000; Lafuma et al. 
2001; Soler et al. 2010; Scott-Baumann and Morgan 2015), and 
potentially 4) attractiveness in sexual selection (e.g., Soler et al. 
1998; Brouwer and Komdeur 2004). Depending upon which nest 
function is more important for a species, different materials are 
likely to have a higher value. Thermal properties of nests are af-
fected by overall design and the presence of feathers (Hilton et 
al. 2004), while anti-parasite properties are linked to the inclusion 
of specific plants (Clark and Mason 1985; Gwinner et al. 2000; 
Mennerat et al. 2009b). Regardless of which functions are impor-
tant, the problem is the same, the cost of collection of the material 
must be traded off with the benefit obtained.
There have been very few studies that have assessed exactly how 
transport costs affect the collection of nest construction material, 
but those available show an effect of costs on individual decisions. 
For example, hamsters conduct fewer trips, and transport larger 
loads per trip when nesting material is further away (Guerra and 
Ades 2002). Marsh harriers, Curcus aeriginous, minimize material 
collection costs while still ensuring the nest’s structural quality by 
changing to less preferred materials when preferred material is fur-
ther away (Staneviclus and Baleviclus 2005). The most comprehen-
sive study of nesting material use to date was conducted on Cape 
weavers, Ploceus capensis, showing that nest construction is a com-
plex task whereby individuals take into account the material’s struc-
tural properties, proximity to the nest site, and its value to the nest 
(Bailey et al. 2016). However, to date there have been no studies 
that explicitly test the trade-off between travel costs and material 
collection in the wild, which would allow us to test when less pre-
ferred material is substituted for more preferred material across a 
range of possible nesting materials.
The hazel dormouse is an endangered UK mammal (Bright and 
Morris 1995) which has been the subject of a number of conserva-
tion efforts over the past 40 or so years. Like other small nocturnal 
mammals, hazel dormice construct nests that serve as refuges from 
predators and aid in thermoregulation (Hayward and Rosentreter 
1994; Ellison 1995; Deacon 2006), with both males and females 
building (sometimes multiple) nests throughout the year (Juskaitis 
2008). Conservation efforts have largely centered on the placement 
of nest boxes in the hazel dormouse’s optimal habitat, traditionally 
coppiced ancient woodland where the variety of plant species in 
the under-storey provides food required by the dormouse during 
spring and summer, and enough food in autumn to allow hiberna-
tion (Bright and Morris 1995; Bright et al. 2006). Dormice build 
both summer (for shelter and breeding) and winter (for hibernation) 
nests and there are differences in their construction and placement. 
Winter nests tend to be composed of fewer different types of mate-
rial (Gubert et al. 2022), perform a different function, that is, ther-
moregulation, and are also built close to the ground (Bright and 
Morris 1995). However, the availability of nest building material at 
both times of year may be vital to their success.
The plant species that are used as nesting materials (both for 
summer and winter nests) are often taken from the nearest avail-
able vegetation (Zaytseva 2006; Juskaitis 2008; Bracewell and 
Downs 2017; Gubert et al. 2022). However, there are many cases 
where the leaves of the tree on which the nest is located are not 
the dominant material (Juskaitis 2008). Thus, there is a clear indica-
tion that hazel dormice are not only willing to travel some distance 
from the nest box to obtain nest material, particularly for summer 
nests (Bracewell and Downs 2017), but also that they prefer certain 
species over others (Wachtendorf 1951; Bright and Morris 1991; 
Juskaitis 2014; Čanády 2015). A previous study on the winter hiber-
nation nests of hazel dormouse, Muscardinus avellanarius, found that 
within the 3m radius assessed, some materials were collected from 
further away than others (Gubert et al. 2022) suggesting an interac-
tion between plant type and distance traveled. In Britain, nests have 
been found that were partly constructed from honeysuckle bark in 
areas where there were no signs of honeysuckle growing nearby 
(Bright et al. 2006). A study on captive hazel dormouse showed that 
there was a significant preference for grass as the main summer 
nesting material (Hagemans et al. 2007). However, in this study, 
the dormice were in a cage, as part of the reintroduction program, 
with nesting material provided on the ground. However, in the wild 
we would expect little use of grass in summer nests, which tend to 
be higher above the ground compared to winter nests as dormice 
are arboreal (Bright et al. 2006), although in winter the use of grass 
is more likely.
Here, we set out to examine the nesting material preferences of 
wild dormice when building summer nests in nest boxes provided 
by the Devon Dormouse Group and whether they conform to pre-
dictions of optimal foraging when collecting material for nest con-
struction. To do so, we: 1) determined the effect of distance to the 
nest on a) the type, and b) the amount of material used; 2) deter-
mined whether the effort exerted (distance traveled × proportion in 
nest) in collecting a material varies between plant species, and 3) as-
sessed nest material preference when there are minimal travel costs, 
that is, a plant is next to the nest.
If all materials are equally useful, then optimal foraging theory 
would predict that whether a plant is used, or not, would depend 
solely on distance (Staneviclus and Baleviclus 2005; Mainwaring 
and Hartley 2013; Bailey et al. 2016), that is, travel associated 
costs minimized. However, if the dormice exhibit preferences for 
specific plants, or certain plants are more “valuable” than others, 
the relationship between distance and use of the material would 
be more complex, with some plants being used despite greater dis-
tances, as their value offsets the increased travel costs as suggested 
by Bracewell and Downs (2017). When costs are relatively equal, 
as for the study on captive dormice (Hagemans et al. 2007), or for 
the wild winter nest study (Gubert et al. 2022), we may see a dif-
ferent absolute preference, as how much is used should depend only 
on the preference for that material, with no travel cost trade off 
required.
METHODS
Nests
Hazel dormice nests were obtained from six different sites (Site) 
throughout Southwest England (Figure 1) in collaboration with 
Devon Dormouse Group. A total of 42 summer nests (NestID) 
were used for data collection and analyses. Nests were located on 
five different species of tree, hazel, (Corylus avellana—30 nests), oak 
(Quercus robur—5 nests), birch (Betula pendula—3 nests), beech (Fagus 
sylvatica—2 nests), and hawthorn (Crataegus laevigata—2 nests).
All nests were built in wooden nest boxes specially designed for 
dormice and placed at the recommended height of 1.5–2 m off the 
ground (Bright et al. 2006), except for one nest from Lady’s Wood 
that was built in a bird box. Thirty-seven nests were built between 
April and November 2008 and were entirely taken out from the 
nest box at the beginning of summer 2009, before the hazel dor-
mice became active and inhabited the nest box. Five of the 11 nests

from Pitt’s Plantation were from 2009. For these nests, the nest box 
it was built in was noted, but since there was a high possibility of 
it being used by the dormice, due to the time of year, the nests 
were not taken from the nest box in order to avoid disturbing them, 
and the data was collected in situ. Composition of nests and pro-
portion of plant materials used at Pitt’s plantation did not differ 
significantly between years, therefore the data from both years was 
combined.
Nest analysis
Nests were separated by hand, and plant materials (Plant) were 
identified using a microscope when necessary (Figure 2a and b). For 
the five nests from Pitt’s plantation that were analyzed at the nest 
site, we used a twig to move around the nest material to identify the 
species. Plant materials were separated by species (both bark and 
leaf), and we recorded, 1) whether a species was used or not (Use), 
and 2) the percentage of each species in the nest (Perc).
In all nests, hazel bark, honeysuckle (Lonicera periclymenum) bark 
(not leaves), and “grass” (most likely bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-
scripta), were used as long strips to provide nest structure. The 
main plants used in lining the nest were oak, birch, bramble 
(Rubus fruticosus), beech, ivy (Hedera helix), hazel leaves, and haw-
thorn. Overall usage of  moss was high, but out of  23 nests 
that contained moss 13 of  them had a mass of  moss shaped as 
a cup, which indicates that most likely the dormouse nest was 
built on top of  an old bird’s nest, so moss use was not ana-
lyzed further. Other plant species sometimes used in the nests 
were rhododendron (Rhododendron ponticum), sycamore (Acer 
pseudoplatanus), blackthorn (Prunus spinose), fern (various species), 
elder (Sambucus nigra), and mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia). Each 
of  these was used in only one nest, except for blackthorn which 
was used in four, so these species were not included in the statis-
tical analysis and the percentage of  these materials and moss was 
combined as “Other.”

ivy, oak) relative to each nest. The distance, measured with field 
measuring tape, was taken from the circumference of the tree in 
which the nest box was situated to the circumference of nearest tree 
of the above eight species, whether or not the species was used in 
that particular nest. If the tree the nest box was situated on was one 
of the identified species, the distance for that species was recorded 
as 0.2 m (assuming that there would be a short travel distance to 
the leaves); for honeysuckle, the distance to the radius of the tree on 
which honeysuckle was climbing was measured. Also, since hazel 
dormice use honeysuckle bark they have stripped off, only mature 
honeysuckle with a flaky bark surface (i.e., that enabled the dormice 
to strip the bark) was measured.
Hazel dormice are highly arboreal and move between trees 
rarely coming down on to the ground (Bright and Morris 1991; 
Bright et al. 2006), so only those plants that were physically acces-
sible from the tree that nest box was situated in were measured (un-
like in Bracewell and Downs 2017 who measured linear distance of 
a plant to the nest whether or not there was an arboreal route). If 
a species was absent in the area, that species was recorded as not 
available. Throughout the analysis hazel leaf and hazel bark are 
treated as separate data points as they were used for different func-
tions in the nest, filler and structure respectively.
Statistical analysis
We calculated the percentage of each plant material type in each 
nest (including all possible plants not just the eight main species). 
One site did not have any birch or beech, but the rest of the plant 
species were found at all sites. In total, there were 334 data points 
from 42 nests.
As hazel and honeysuckle were both used as a core structural 
material, we conducted a Chi square test (R Studio: Pearson’s) on 
whether each was “used” versus “not used” across the 42 nests to 
determine preference for structural material.
Plant use and distance
Not all plants were used, even when available in the area (Table 
1), so the data contained an extremely high number of 0s for Use 
in the nest. Therefore, a hurdle analysis was conducted splitting 
the data into two analyses (Duan et al. 1983; Mullahy 1986; Zuur 
et al 2009). First, a General linear model (GLM), with a binomial 
error distribution (using R package Lme4; Bates et al. 2015) was 
used to determine whether material Use (response variable: 0 = 
no,1 = yes) was affected by 1) the distance to the plant from the 
nest (“Distance”)—for plants available at that site, 2) plant species 
(“Plant”); 3) their interaction or 4) site of nest (“Site”), and 5) Nest 
ID.
Second, a linear model (LM) regression model (using Lme4, Bates 
et al. 2015) was used to determine the effect of distance to the plant 
from the nest on the log percentage (LogPerc: log transformed for 
normality) of that plant used in building the nest. Factors included 
were as above (Plant, Distance, Site, and Nest ID).
Plant preference close to nest
We tested whether dormice exhibit a preference for a particular 
plant species by comparing the use of plants that were close to the 
nest, that is, transport costs were minimal (as in Gubert et al. 2022). 
We did this by conducting a second linear model (lm) that included 
usage data only on plants that were less than 2.6 m from the nest 
(includes the tree nest is sited in, plus directly adjacent trees only). 
The percentage of each of these plants used in the nest, LogPerc, 
was included as the response variable (again log transformed but 
including 0s,), and Plant, Site, and NestID were included as explan-
atory variables.
Relative effort expended on each plant
To test for differences in effort made for each plant, a new variable 
“Effort” (proportion in nest x distance) was calculated for each ma-
terial used (a high score indicating higher use at greater distances 
from the nest). Effort was then included as the response variable in 
a general linear model fitted with a gamma error distribution and 
log link with Plant, Site, and NestID as explanatory variables.
Analyses were run both with and without nests containing more 
than 30% moss (N = 7, nests likely built on top of old bird nests), 
however as excluding those nests did not affect the outcome of the 
analysis, we have reported only the results including all nests. For 
all analyses, NestID was not included as a random factor as this led 
to a singular fit, with a random effects variance of 0, likely because 
each plant occurs only once per NestID. Therefore, NestID was in-
cluded as a fixed factor in all models.
For all models, significance was tested using the drop1 function 
in R with a chi-square or F test (for GLMs and LMs, respectively). 
Post-hoc pairwise comparisons of significant factors were con-
ducted using Tukey tests with the R package emmeans (Lenth 2022).
All statistical analyses were run in R v3.5.1 (R Core Team 2022, 
version 4.1.0) and figures were produced using R package ggplot2 
(Wickham 2016).
Ethics
All nests from 2008 were taken from the nest boxes by the dormice 
license holders who conduct the checks for each site. Even though 
none of the hazel dormice or the nest boxes were disturbed during 
the data collection, nest sites were always visited with a dormice 
license holder when they conducted their routine monthly check. 
The on-site analysis of the five nests from Pitt’s plantation was also 
conducted under the supervision of dormice license holder, with 
extra attention so as not to disturb any local hazel dormice.
RESULTS
Description of nesting materials
Most of the nests were composed of two layers of noticeably dif-
ferent materials; 1) leaves and 2) flexible, narrow, and elongated 
vegetation strands such as bark and grass. Leaves were used as an

outer layer of the nests, and strands were woven as the core part 
of the nest. Only one nest had no signs of leaves, and one nest was 
made entirely out of leaves and had no strands. Composition was 
very variable between nests (Figure 3), but all included at least one 
of the eight most common species.
Thirty-five nests contained honeysuckle bark as an inner core, 
seven contained hazel bark, one contained only grass, three con-
tained hazel and grass, one contained honeysuckle and grass, none 
contained both hazel and honeysuckle. There was a significant 
preference for honeysuckle bark compared to hazel bark as a core 
structural material (honeysuckle and hazel were available to all 
nests: Chi-square test; Χ22 = 32.21, P < 0.001).
Presence/absence in nest and distance
There were main effects of Plant, Distance, and Plant × Distance 
on whether a plant was used or not (glm: plant: LRT = 66.8, 
P < 0.001; distance: LRT = 5.32, P = 0.02, plant × distance: 
LRT = 25.1, P = 0.0015, Figure 4). There was no effect of Site 
(P = 0.71) or NestID (P = 0.51). Most species were less likely 
to be used when further away, but the effect varied across nest 
materials.
Percentage used in nest
Plant species had a significant effect on the percentage of plant in 
the nest (LogPerc) (F8,138 = 2.32, P = 0.03, Figure 5a), but there 
was no significant effect of Distance or Site (P = 0.25, and 0.73 re-
spectively). Honeysuckle use was significantly higher than bramble, 
hawthorn and ivy (Tukey’s P < 0.05).
When considering only plants less than 2.6 m from the nest, 
there was a significant preference for some Plant species (lm: 
F8,163 = 9.7, P < 0.0001, Figure 5b). Tukey contrasts showed that 
honeysuckle, oak, and beech were used at a higher percentage, 
and bramble and hazel bark were used much less (P < 0.001 to 
P = 0.02).
There were significant differences in the amount of effort ex-
erted in order to collect different species of Plant for nest material, 
(plant: F8,146 = 4.69, P < 0.0001, Figure 5c), there was no effect of 
Site (P = 0.59). Tukey post hoc tests showed in general that more 
effort was used to collect honeysuckle, beech and oak compared to 
the other plant species available (P < 0.001 to P = 0.04).
DISCUSSION
Our findings show that whether material will be used in a nest, or 
not, is partially determined by how far away that material is from 
the nest, consistent with the predictions of optimal foraging theory. 
However, this effect varies significantly between plant species, with 
some plants being used even when they are distant from the nest, 
e.g., oak and honeysuckle. In addition, we found no relationship be-
tween the relative amount of material used in the nest and distance 
to that plant species from the nest, in contrast to what would be 
expected under optimal foraging theory (specifically, central place 
foraging models). Furthermore, when looking at the overall effort 
used to collect different plants, and how much of a plant was used 
when travel costs were minimum (i.e., considering only plants less 
than 2.6 m away from the nest), there were also strong preferences 
for particular species. Honeysuckle bark as a core construction ma-
terial, and oak and beech as leaf matter were all used in relatively 
high amounts, even when at greater distances from the nest than 
other plants. This suggests that nest material collection does not en-
tirely follow predictions from optimal foraging theory due to strong 
preferences for specific nest materials which likely have more value 
as a nest material.
The fact that foraging for nest material is only partially con-
sistent with optimal foraging theory is not completely unexpected 
given there are clear differences between foraging for nest material 
and foraging for food (Ruiz-Castellano et al. 2018). For example, 
for some nest materials there may be a minimum amount needed 
to fulfill the necessary function (Clark and Mason 1985; Lafuma et

ably more is always better. However, using optimal foraging theory 
to make predictions is a useful method for identifying preferences 
in contexts outside of foraging (Guerra and Ades 2002; Bailey et 
al. 2016).
Many studies have used a similar approach to ours to investi-
gate habitat preferences (Johnson 1980; Beyer et al. 2010; Lele 
et al. 2013). Here use of a habitat (nesting material in our study) 
is considered selective if it is used disproportionately compared 
with its availability (distance in our study), that is, the amount of 
that habitat accessible to the animal (Aarts et al. 2008; Beyer et 
al. 2010). Identifying resources that are used disproportionately 
relative to their abundance tells us that the resource, for example, 
plant, is important or has a higher value to the animal (Johnson 
1980). As required in order to fully assess preferences (Beyer et 
al. 2010), we have data on the availability (i.e., distance) of both 
used and unused material, so that we can assess non-random use 
of resources (Johnson 1980), that is, preference. The interaction 
between distance and plant use, and relative use of plants in the 
nest showed that some plant species are indeed used dispropor-
tionately compared to availability. We suggest that this is because 
those plant materials are more important/useful as a nest ma-
terial to the dormouse, which would be interesting to research 
further.
Being able to quantify preference within a habitat, taking into 
account availability, provides us with valuable insights into the 
trade-offs the dormice are making when it comes to collecting 
nest material. The different measures of preference (distance from 
which a plant is collected, overall effort expended upon collection, 
and usage when a plant is close) were consistent in terms of which 
plants were preferred: honeysuckle, oak, and beech. Bracewell 
and Downs (2017) also found honeysuckle and beech were used 
in summer nests even when at greater distances than other spe-
cies. In winter nests, honeysuckle, grasses, ferns, and bracken have 
been shown to be collected at greater distances from the nest (but 
all measures were within a 3 m radius of the nest), and no use 
of material outside the 3 m zone was found (Gubert et al. 2022). 
Interestingly, hazel leaf is not commonly used despite the species 
name.
In our study, all but two plants were available in each location 
and the nest construction components did not differ by site, sug-
gesting that nesting material preference is consistent across the

Behavioral Ecology
Devon populations we studied. In other locations across Europe, 
different plants have been found to be commonly used in dor-
mouse summer nests (see references in Juskaitis 2008), for example, 
bramble and European hornbeam Carpinus betulus (Čanády 2015), 
beech (Wachtendorf 1951, Möckel 1988, Vilhelmsen 1996), oak 
(Airapetyants et al. 1983), but these studies did not assess availa-
bility of alternative materials within the habitat. Variation in nest 
construction material used across habitats is likely due to different 
plant species being available, and a number of broad-leaved trees 
may be equally suitable in place of the preferred oak and beech 
that we found. However, without assessing whether use of plant 
material is non-random in relation to distribution of material we 
cannot determine preference, only usage (Johnson 1980). Our study 
allows us to determine non-random use of material in summer 
nests, and therefore explicitly assess preferences.
Although dormice clearly prefer some plant species over others, 
we are unable to determine the motivation, or behavioral mech-
anism underlying those preferences. Determining the reasons why 
a certain construction material is preferred is beyond the scope of 
the current study and thus our conclusions must remain somewhat 
speculative. Usually, core structure and filling are needed to fulfill 
nest functions (Juskaitis 2008, Čanády 2015), and clearly honey-
suckle is preferred for structure (Bright et al. 2006; Bracewell and 
Downs 2017; Gubert et al. 2022). Hazel bark is much narrower and 
shorter, once processed by the dormouse, and is also less flexible 
compared to honeysuckle bark (Hamston, pers comm) and thus it 
may require more time and effort to gather the same amount of 
hazel. Alternatively, honeysuckle bark may provide a better core 
structure due to its length and how easy it is to weave. In many 
studies, including in captivity (Hagemans et al. 2007), grasses are 
also used as structural material (Wachtendorf 1951; Vilhelmsen 
1996; Eden & Eden 2003). Whether the preferred materials per-
form other functions such as being anti-parasitic (e.g., Clark and 
Mason 1985; Gwinner et al. 2000; Mennerat et al. 2009b) would 
be useful to research further through detailed analysis of the prop-
erties of the plants used in the nests.
In terms of leaves, there are several possible reasons for why dor-
mice might exhibit a preference for some plant species over others, 
as mentioned above, some leaves may contain higher levels of 
anti-parasitic compounds (Clark and Mason 1985; Lafuma et al. 
2001) that provide protection or provide better thermoregulation 
of the nest (Ellison 1995; Mertens 1997). However, further work 
is required to quantify specific differences in plant compounds in 
the local habitat and to determine thermal differences in dry leaves. 
Dormice collect the leaves when green (Juskaitis 2008), but it is as-
sumed leaf thermal properties improve as they dry out. It would be 
interesting to see what criteria dormice use when collecting leaves 
and whether these criteria provide the dormice with information on 
their thermal potential.
Although our results demonstrate a clear preference for certain 
nesting materials, we were unable to control for the availability of 
the specific mix of accessible plants, and there could be interactions 
between plant material distances, for example, perhaps beech is 
used more often when oak is further away, as both are expected to 
perform similar functions. The interrelationships between the dis-
tances of all the different plants available would be very complex 
to model. Five of the 42 nests contained a lot of moss, likely due to 
the fact they were constructed above an old bird’s nest, but whether 
the presence of pre-existing material has any impact on subsequent 
nest construction is unclear. Finally, for logistical reasons, that is, 
being able to find nests, we investigated nests constructed in nest 
boxes, which could differ somewhat in construction material used 
compared to “natural” nests which have no external walls.
Overall, our study confirms that when assessing suitability for 
dormice in UK woodland, all plants are not equal. Honeysuckle 
is a very important component of nests, as are beech and oak. 
Although hazel trees may be preferred for the site of the nest, it 
does not appear to be used very often for construction. In addition, 
we have shown that looking at use in relation to availability of ma-
terial for nest construction allows us to determine importance and 
preference more clearly than looking at overall use alone.
