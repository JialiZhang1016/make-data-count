Abstract
Oral cancer remains a deadly disease worldwide. Lymph node metastasis and
invasion is one of the causes of death from oral cancer. Elucidating the mechanism
of oral cancer lymph node metastasis and identifying critical regulatory genes are
important for the treatment of this disease. This study aimed to identify differentially
expressed genes (gene signature) and pathways that contribute to oral cancer
metastasis to lymph nodes. The GSE70604-associated study compared gene profiles
in lymph nodes with metastasis of oral cancer to those of normal lymph nodes. The
GSE2280-associated study compared gene profiles in primary tumor of oral cancer
with lymph node metastasis to those in tumors without lymph node metastasis.
There are 28 common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) showing consistent
changes in both datasets in overlapping analysis. GO biological process and KEGG
pathway analysis of these 28 DEGs identified the gene signature CCND1, JUN and
SPP1, which are categorized as key regulatory genes involved in the focal adhesion
pathway. Silencing expression of CCND1, JUN and SPP1 in the human oral cancer
cell line OECM-1 confirmed that those genes play essential roles in oral cancer cell
invasion. Analysis of clinical samples of oral cancer found a strong correlation of
these genes with short survival, especially JUN expression associated with metastasis.
Our study identified a unique gene signature – CCND1, JUN and SPP1 – which may
be involved in oral cancer lymph node metastasis.

Introduction
Oral cancer is a major devastating head and neck cancer subtype and is any cancerous
tissue growth located in the oral cavity or oropharynx [1]. There are several types of
oral cancers, but around 90% of oral cancers are squamous cell carcinomas. Oral can-
cer is the sixth most common malignancy in humans. Its incidence and mortality have
also increased over the past decades. In 2013, oral cancer resulted in 135,000 deaths,
up from 84,000 deaths in 1990 [2]. Oral cancer is characterized by poor prognosis and
a low survival rate despite sophisticated surgical and radiotherapeutic modalities. The
five-year survival rate is only 63% in the United States.
Metastasis is one of the main causes of oral cancer patients’ death. The process of
oral cancer metastasis is a series of sequential and interdependent events involving de-
tachment of cells from tumor tissue, increased cell motility and local invasion, angio-
genesis, intravasation of invading cells into the vasculature or lymphatic systems,

extravasation and subsequent deposition and proliferation at a second site. Oral cancer
tends to spread primarily to the regional lymph nodes of the neck first before it spreads
to remote sites. Lymph node metastasis is called locoregional metastasis and lung (or
other organs) metastasis is called distant metastasis [3]. Early diagnosis of lymph node
metastasis is important for improving clinical outcomes of oral cancer patients [4].
The clinical diagnosis of lymph node metastasis of oral cancer is currently based
on imaging techniques and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) [5]. However,
current imaging tests have been proven to be unreliable, especially in the detection
of early nodal diseases. Localization of SLNB in patients with certain cancers such
as floor-of-mouth carcinoma is difficult. The difficulties of detecting micrometasta-
sis
in

sections
also
limit
SLNB
as
an
adequate
guide
to
clinical
decision-making [6]. Therefore, better understanding of the lymphatic metastasis of
oral cancer and developing new diagnostic strategies to predict the clinical behav-
ior of the disease are desired [4].
Identifying reliable gene signatures or molecular biomarkers for oral cancer lymph
node metastasis is highly valuable to use as a potential diagnostic or prognostic tool for
routine clinical practice of oral cancer. Microarray analysis has been extensively used to
examine the global gene expression changes in non-metastatic versus metastatic human
tumor samples. Comparing the gene expression profiles of primary tumors from
non-metastatic and metastatic tumor generated a list of genes whose expression was
significantly different in these two groups. The list of genes is called “metastasis signa-
tures”. Several “metastasis signatures” have been generated in oral cancer aimed at pre-
dicting lymph node metastasis [7–17]. However, defined “metastasis signatures” from
different studies are highly variable, which hinders their translation to clinical applica-
tions. To date, none of the identified signatures or molecular biomarkers has been suc-
cessfully implemented as a diagnostic or prognostic tool applicable to routine clinical
practice of oral cancer.
In this study, in order to identify differentially expressed genes (gene signature) and
pathways that contribute to oral cancer metastasis to lymph nodes, we designed a new
bioinformatic analysis strategy. The GSE70604-associated study is aimed at identifying
lymph node metastasis-associated genes and pathways in oral cancer by comparing
gene profiles in lymph nodes with metastasis to those of normal lymph nodes. The
GSE2280-associated study tried to achieve this goal by comparing gene profiles in squa-
mous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity with lymph node metastasis to those in tumors
without lymph node metastasis. Then overlapping analysis was performed to identify
common DEGs (gene signature) and pathways in these two studies. We focused on
those 28 common DEGs that show consistent changes in both datasets and defined a
“metastasis signature”: CCND1, JUN and SPP1 for oral cancer lymph node metastasis.
Both Jun and SPP1 are known molecules involved in cancer cell invasiveness and
tumor metastasis. CCND1 (cyclinD1) is a known critical factor in cell cycle progression,
but the function of CCND1 in human cancer cell migration/invasion is not sufficiently
understood despite a recent study showing that it directly regulates the focal adhesion
pathway and promotes R3327 rat prostatic tumor cell migration/invasion and tumor
metastasis [18] and affects cell migration and invasion in breast cancer [18–21]. Our
study identified a novel “focal adhesion”-related gene signature (CCND1, JUN and
SPP1) that might be applicable for diagnosis of oral cancer metastasis to lymph nodes.

Materials and methods
Cell lines
OECM-1 is a human oral cancer cell line derived from gingival epidermoid carcinoma
of a patient [22]. The cells were cultured in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), 2 mmol/ l glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL
streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C.
siRNA interference
SPP1, JUN and CCND1 siRNA smart pool (Cat. L-009152-00-0005) was purchased
from Dharmacon/Thermo Fisher Scientific. Transfection of the siRNA oligonucleotide
duplexes was performed in a 6-well plate (1 × 10 5 cells per well) with Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen, Inc.), using the methods recommended by the manufacturer. Knock-
down of SPP1, JUN and CCND1 with siRNA was examined 72 h after siRNA transfec-
tion through western blotting.

phenyl-methylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/mL leupeptin, and 25 μg/mL aprotinin and clari-
fied by centrifugation (14,000 g for 30 min at 4 °C). The protein concentration of the
cell lysates was determined using the Bradford Coomassie blue method (Pierce Chem-
ical Corp.). Whole-cell lysates were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-PAGE
and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked with PBS
containing 5% (w/v) skim milk at 4 °C for 2 h, washed with PBST (PBS with 0.05%
Tween-20), and then incubated overnight with primary antibody. After washing with
PBST, the membrane was incubated with a second antibody at room temperature for
2 h, washed with PBST and then developed with the ECL system. The results of West-
ern blot were analyzed with Odyssey software version 3.0.
Cell invasion assay
Cell invasion potential was measured with a Boyden transwell chamber consisting of
upper inserts with 8-μm-pore-size filter membranes at the bottom of the inserts and
lower wells in 24-well cell culture plates (Corning Life Sciences). 20 μl of 1:6 diluted
Matrigel (2–3 mg/ml protein) was added to the center of each cell well insert. Coated
inserts were placed in an incubator to allow the Matrigel to solidify for 20–30 min.
Cells (3.5 × 105 cells in 0.2 mL) suspended in serum-free medium with 0.1% bovine
serum albumin were seeded into the inserts of the chambers. The inserts were then
placed over the wells filled with 0.5 mL of 10% FBS culture medium and incubated in a
37 °C incubator for 24 h. Cells that had not penetrated the filter membrane in the in-
serts were wiped off with cotton swabs, and the cells on the underside of the filter
membrane were fixed and stained with the HEMA-3 kit (Fisher Diagnostics). Invaded
cells were counted in a total of 10 fields for each sample under a microscope with the
10X objective and the stained cell number per field was calculated.

Differentially expressed genes (DEG) analysis
Differentially expressed genes of the GSE2280-associated study and GSE2280-associated
study were analyzed. The expression abundance (FPKM) value of each gene was estimated
by running cufflinks [23] and the differentially expressed genes were assessed by cuffdiff.
Statistically differentially expressed genes between two groups were those genes with
logFC (fold change) > 0.45 and adjusted p value < 0.05. The adjusted p value was obtained
through applying Benjamini and Hochberg’s (BH) false discovery rate correction on the
original p value, and the fold change threshold was selected based on our purpose of fo-
cusing on significantly differentially expressed genes.
Hierarchical clustering
Hierarchical clustering was conducted [24] to classify analyzed samples based on gene
expression profiles. Hierarchical clustering using differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
demonstrated the global gene expression patterns in the samples. In addition, the DEGs
were further extracted and classified in specific biological processes (Gene Ontology
terms) and KEGG pathways. The expression pattern of those DEGs was characterized
and heat maps of the DEGs were classified in targeted biological processes or KEGG
pathways using the R package.
GO and KEGG pathway analysis
We used the R packages GO.db, KEGG.db and KEGGREST to detect Gene Ontology
categories and KEGG pathways with significant enrichment in DEGs for comparison
across all measured genes. The significantly enriched biological processes were identi-
fied by p value less than the threshold value 0.05. For the KEGG pathway, the p value
was also set to less than 0.05.
Results
Identification of potential genes related to oral cancer metastasis to lymph nodes
through screening GEO database
In order to find the key genes regulating oral cancer metastasis to lymph nodes, we
screened the GEO (gene expression omnibus) database for GSE70604 (https://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE70604) [25] and GSE2280 (https://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE2280) [12] as shown in Additional
file 1: Table S1 and Additional file 2: Table S3.
In GSE70604, the comparisons of gene expression profiles were made between lymph
nodes with metastasis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and normal lymph
nodes (comparison 1).
In GSE2280, the comparisons of gene expression profiles were made between primary
tumors of OSCC which has lymph node metastasis and nonmetastatic primary OSCC
without lymph node metastasis (comparison 2).
Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of both comparisons were obtained where
lymph nodes with OSCC metastasis were compared to normal lymph nodes in com-
parison 1 and metastatic OSCC primary tumors were compared to non-metastatic
OSCC primary tumors in comparison 2. Both comparisons had the |log(fold change)|(-
logFC) > 0.45 and p value < 0.05, indicating the overall changes as statistically

significant. In comparison 1, gene expression of 7 lymph nodes with metastasis of
OSCC was compared to that of a normal lymph node. Figure 1 shows the distribution
of DEGs in comparison 1; we found that 1392 genes had expression changes
(Additional file 1: Table S1). Among those genes, we identified 723 down-regulated
genes (Additional file 3: Table S2) and 699 up-regulated genes (Additional file 2: Table
S3). In comparison 2, gene expression of 5 primary tumors of OSCC with lymph node
metastasis was compared to that of 8 non-metastatic primary tumors of OSCC. Figure 2
shows the distribution of DEGs in comparison 2; we found 890 genes that had expres-
sion changes (Additional file 4: Table S4). Among those genes, we identified 477
down-regulated genes (Additional file 5: Table S5) and 413 up-regulated genes
(Additional file 6: Table S6). To identify potential genes related to oral cancer metasta-
sis to lymph nodes, we then analyzed the overlapping DEGs in comparison 1 and com-
parison 2 and found 114 overlapping DEGs. Among those DEGs, 28 of 114 DEGs had
a consistent change trend (consistent increase or decrease in both comparisons)
(Additional file 7: Table S7) and the remaining 86 had an opposite change trend
(Additional file 8: Table S8). The 28 genes with consistent changes in comparison 1
and comparison 2 are the potential genes related to oral cancer lymph node metastasis.

GO-KEGG analysis of consistent overlapping DEGs
We further analyzed the 28 consistent overlapping DEGs by GO-KEGG analysis. GO bio-
logical process analysis indicated that these 28 genes were involved in 448 biological pro-
cesses; Additional file 9: Table S9 shows the top 10 biological processes. KEGG pathway
analysis showed that those genes mainly participated in 12 signaling pathways (Additional
file 10: Table S10) and the top 3 KEGG signaling pathways are colorectal cancer, Toll-like
receptor signaling pathway and Chagas disease. We also identified 7 interacting gene pairs
among these 28 overlapping genes (Additional file 11: Table S11). Among those genes,
JUN, ATF3 and FOS were presented as the key connecting nodes in the network of signal-
ing pathways according to connectivity. JUN and FOS cooperatively participated in 9
common KEGG signaling pathway among the 12 KEGG pathways we identified. JUN,
ATF3 and FOS were involved in 257, 115 and 183 GO-biological processes respectively.
Definition of key regulatory genes involved in oral cancer metastasis to lymph nodes
Among 12 KEGG pathways we identified by analyzing the 28 consistent overlapping
DEGs (Additional file 10: Table S10), we mainly focus on the focal adhesion pathway,
which is important for cancer cell migration/invasion and tumor metastasis.

made between primary tumors of squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity (OSCC) which has lymph
node metastasis and nonmetastatic primary OSCC without lymph node metastasis

Three DEGs associated with the focal adhesion pathway in the 28 consistent overlap-
ping DEGs are CCND1, JUN and SPP1. Both JUN and SPP1 are genes known to pro-
mote cancer cell invasiveness and tumor metastasis. CCND1 (cyclinD1), a critical gene
regulating cell cycle progress, recently has been reported to directly regulate the focal
adhesion pathway and promote R3327 rat prostatic tumor cell migration/invasion and
tumor metastasis [18]. The direct involvement of CCND1 in human cancer cell migra-
tion/invasion is virtually unknown. Our study identified a novel focal adhesion-related
gene signature (CCND1, JUN and SPP1) that might be important for oral cancer me-
tastasis to lymph nodes.
Gene signature CCND1, JUN and SPP1 are required for oral cancer cell invasion
To confirm the function of CCND1, JUN and SPP1 in oral cancer cell invasion, we
knocked down expression of CCND1, JUN and SPP1 through siRNA in the human oral
cancer cell line OECM-1 and examined the alteration of cell invasion ability. Deletion
of CCND1, JUN and SPP1 expression in OECM-1 via siRNA interference significantly
impaired cell invasion although in varying degrees (Fig. 3a-c). The result further sup-
ports the hypothesis that the focal adhesion-related gene signature (CCND1, JUN and
SPP1) is important for oral cancer invasion.

C- JUN expression is correlated with oral cancer metastasis in clinical practice
We further tried to explore the correlation of expression of CCND1, JUN and SPP1
with oral cancer metastasis through statistically analyzing the clinic data in the litera-
ture. Based on the original data of Rickman’s work published in 2008 in Oncogene [26],
we compared JUN expression in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma in patients
without metastatic events at 5 years with that of patients with metastatic events at
5 years [26]. Metastatic oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma had 1.69-fold higher
JUN gene expression than non-metastatic oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (p =
0.025). Figure 4 compares JUN expression in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma in
patients without metastatic events at 3 years with that of patients with metastatic
events at 3 years [26]. Metastatic oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma had 2.69-fold
higher JUN gene expression than non-metastatic oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma
(p = 0.012) (Fig. 4). Figure 5 compared JUN expression in oral cavity squamous cell car-
cinoma in patients without metastatic events at 5 years than that of patients with meta-
static events at 5 years [26]. Metastatic oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma had
2.39-fold higher JUN gene expression than non-metastatic oral cavity squamous cell
carcinoma (p = 0.025) (Fig. 5). Figure 6 compares JUN expression in oropharyngeal
squamous cell carcinoma in patients without metastatic events at 5 years with that of
patients with metastatic events at 5 years [26]. Metastatic oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma had 1.69-fold higher JUN gene expression than non-metastatic oropharyn-
geal squamous cell carcinoma (p = 0.025) (Fig. 6). The results suggest that c-JUN is
strongly correlated with oral cancer metastasis. We have not found similar gene expres-
sion data of CCND1 and SPP1 in oral cancer metastasis. However, we observed that
higher expression of Jun or CCND1 or SPP1 was associated with short survival of oral
squamous cell carcinoma patients (Figs. 7, 8 and 9).

Discussion
Through bioinformatics analysis of the gene expression profile of oral cancer metastatic
and non-metastatic lymph nodes and primary tumors, we identified a new oral cancer
metastatic gene signature: CCND1, JUN and SPP1. The gene knockdown experiment
on the oral cancer cell line and clinical data correlation analysis indicated strong associ-
ation of this gene signature expression with oral cancer invasion and metastasis.
c-Jun is a subunit of transcription factor AP-1. Activated AP-1 increases the tran-
scription of target genes and plays roles in cell division, proliferation, differentiation,
apoptosis and so on. Although overexpression of c-Jun promotes invasion and metasta-
sis of various tumors [27–29], it has not been reported in oral cancer. c-Jun plays a role

during the initiation and progression of OSCC. High expression of c-Jun is associated
with poor prognosis of OSCC [30]. Through a gene knockdown experiment in oral can-
cer cell line and clinical data analysis, our study confirmed that it is also required for
oral cancer invasion and metastasis.
SPP1 (secreted phosphoprotein 1) encodes osteopontin (OPN). Osteopontin is a se-
creted non-collagenous, sialic acid rich, chemokine-like, matricellular phosphoglyco-
protein that facilitates cell–matrix interactions and promotes tumor progression [31].
Osteopontin is a multifunctional cytokine regulating cell proliferation, survival, drug re-
sistance, invasion, and stem-like behavior. Its aberrant expression and/or splicing is
functionally responsible for many disease pathologies including cancer [31]. The ex-
pression of OPN was elevated in 95% of OSCC and can be used as a diagnostic marker
for oral cancer [32]. It is also a poor prognostic factor in OSCC treated with
cisplatin-based IC followed by CCRT [33]. However, its correlation with OSCC invasion
and metastasis has not been studied anywhere else. The gene knockdown experiment
in an oral cancer cell line and clinical data analysis showed that SPP1 is important for
oral cancer invasion and metastasis in this study. Besides aberrant expression, the pat-
tern of isoform expression (gene splicing) and post-translational modification are other
SPP1 regulation methods. This regulation is cell-type specific and may influence the
potential role of OPN in malignancy as a cancer biomarker [34] For example, invasive
breast tumor cells generate three splice variants of OPN, while non-invasive breast cells
express only the unspliced form or no OPN at all [35]. We do not know the splice vari-
ants of SPP1 in non-metastatic oral cancer and metastatic oral cancer with lymph node
metastasis beside the expression difference, which deserves further investigation.
A recent study showed that CCND1 (cyclin D1) together with its binding partner CDK4
does not only simply act as a transcriptional regulator to control cell proliferation, but also
controls cell adhesion, migration and metastasis under normal and pathological condi-
tions. The focal adhesion component paxillin is a cytoplasmic substrate of CCND1·CDK4.
This complex phosphorylates a fraction of paxillin specifically associated with the cell

membrane, and promotes Rac1 activation, thereby triggering membrane ruffling and cell
invasion in both normal fibroblasts and tumor cells [18]. Cytoplasmic CCND1 controls
the migration and invasiveness of mantle lymphoma cells [36]. However, more evidence is
needed to support the function of CCND1 in cell invasion and metastasis, especially in
clinic samples. CCND1 is one of the DEGS with elevated expression in both metastatic
lymph nodes and metastatic primary tumor of oral cancer in our analysis. The results sug-
gested the important function of CCND1 in promoting oral cancer lymph node metastasis
although the detained mechanism still needs to be explored.
In sum, this study identifies a unique gene signature – CCND1, JUN and SPP1 –
which could be a new early biomarker for diagnosing oral cancer lymph node invasion
and metastasis.
