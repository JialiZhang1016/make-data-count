Pyrazolates

Abstract:
The
homoleptic
pyrazolate
complexes
[CeIII
4-
(Me2pz)12] and [CeIV(Me2pz)4]2 quantitatively insert CO2 to
give [CeIII
4(Me2pz·CO2)12] and [CeIV(Me2pz·CO2)4], respec-
tively (Me2pz = 3,5-dimethylpyrazolato). This process is rever-
sible for both complexes, as observed by in situ IR and NMR
spectroscopy in solution and by TGA in the solid state. By
adjusting the molar ratio, one molecule of CO2 per [CeIV-
(Me2pz)4] complex could be inserted to give trimetallic [Ce3-
(Me2pz)9(Me2pz·CO2)3(thf)]. Both the cerous and ceric in-
sertion products catalyze the formation of cyclic carbonates
from epoxides and CO2 under mild conditions. In the absence
of epoxide, the ceric catalyst is prone to reduction by the co-
catalyst tetra-n-butylammonium bromide (TBAB).
Introduction
Inexorably rising CO2 levels in the earths atmosphere—
and their consequential environmental impact—have spurred
much interest in combating CO2 build-up.[1] Capture tech-
nologies, such as carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS)
and direct air capture (DAC),[2] and CO2 conversion into fuels
or chemical feedstocks[3] appear promising. However, such
tactics suffer from either a lack of appropriate storage and
transportation of CO2, or overcoming the high activation
barrier of CO2.[4] To date, the most effective sorbents for CCS/
DAC are alkali-metal/alkaline-earth metal hydroxide solu-
tions, inorganic salts (e.g. alkali-metal carbonates),[1,2] or high-
surface supported polyamines (max. CO2 sorption capacity
ca. 3 mmolg1 at 1 bar)[5] and magnesium-based metal-organ-
ic frameworks (ca. 35 wt% or 8 mmol CO2 g1 at 1 bar).[6]
Like alkaline-earth metals, rare-earth metals (Ln) feature
a high affinity for carbon dioxide (cf. bastnaesite is the most
important LnIII deposit in the Earths crust). Thus, metal-
organic derivatives easily react with or insert CO2, as initially
demonstrated by Bochkarev et al. for homoleptic silylamides
Ln[N(SiMe3)2]3
[7,8]
and
alkoxides
[Ln(OnBu)3]
(Scheme
1c,d).[9,10]
Similar archetypes (including LnIII aryloxides) can also be
used for chemical transformations, such as the catalytic
conversion of a CO2/epoxide mixture into cyclic carbonates[11]
or copolymers.[10a,12,13] However, highly reactive organo-rare-
earth-metal complexes such as alkyl[14] and hydride[10a,15]
(Scheme 1a,b) or divalent derivatives[16] display irreversible
CO2 insertion or favor additional transformations through
CO2 post-activation (e.g. formation of CO, CO3
2, C2O4
2).[16]
Recently, cerium, the most abundant rare-earth element, has
gained attention for CO2 activation.[8,17–19] For example, while
the
hydrogen-bonded
CeIV oxo
complex
[(LOEt)2Ce=O-
(H2O)]·MeC(O)NH2 (LOEt
 = [Co(h5-C5H5){P(O)(OEt)2}3])
was
shown
to
form
the
tetravalent
carbonate
species
[(LOEt)2Ce(CO3)],[17] ortho-NHC-substituted aryloxide CeIII
complexes (NHC = N-heterocyclic carbene) insert CO2 into
the CeCNHC bond in a semireversible manner, and catalyti-
cally form propylene carbonate from propylene oxide.[18,19]
Bulky
cyclopentadienyl
(Cp)
derivatives
(e.g.
Ln-
(C5Me5)3) were shown to accommodate CO2 insertion in
a unidirectional manner, thereby forming very stable carbox-
ylato moieties through a h5-to-h1 switch in the C5Me5
coordination (cf. Scheme 1a).[20] Pyrazolates (pz), on the
other hand, are dinitrogen-derived Cp counterparts, where
the putative NCO2 bond may tolerate a more reversible
insertion process, as seen for other CO2-heteroatom bonds
(Scheme 1e).[21,22] As the tetravalent [Ce(Me2pz)4]2 complex
was recently shown to undergo reversible insertion of ketones
into the CeN bond,[23] we extended the study toward CO2.
Quantitative insertion of CO2 into the CeN(Me2pz) bond
was observed for both tetravalent and trivalent cerium Me2pz
complexes, and intriguingly the insertion process was found to
be fully reversible.

Results and Discussion
Carbon Dioxide Insertion into a Ceric Pyrazolate: Treat-
ment of [Ce(Me2pz)4]2 (1) with excess CO2 in either toluene or
thf (under 1 bar CO2 pressure) led to a color change from
dark red to orange within 5 minutes (Scheme 2). Crystalliza-
tion from concentrated toluene or thf solutions at 408C gave
orange crystals of [Ce(Me2pz·CO2)4] with either toluene
(2·toluene, 54%) or thf (2·thf, 64%) within the lattice.
Discounting the lattice solvent, this accounts for about
25 wt% CO2 or 5.7 mmol CO2 per gram.
The molecular structure of 2·toluene revealed an 8-
coordinate cerium(IV) center with four k2(N,O)-coordinating
Me2pz·CO2 ligands (Figure 1), in contrast to the k2(O,O)
modes in carboxylates and related carbamates. The CeN and
CeO bond lengths average 2.528  and 2.255 , respective-
ly, thus matching the values found in the benzophenone-
inserted product [Ce(Me2pz)2(pdpm)2] (Ce1N1 2.564 ,
Ce1O1 2.173 ; pdpm = (3,5-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl)diphe-
nylmethanolate).[23] Other homoleptic CeIV complexes, [Ce-
(L)4] (with L as a donor-functionalized alkoxy ligand engaged
in a 5-membered chelate to cerium), also have similar CeO
bond lengths as those in 2, thus highlighting a common
chelating coordination motif.[24,25] Seemingly, no delocaliza-
tion occurs across the O=CO fragment, which exhibits
average CO bond lengths of 1.207  (terminal) and 1.291 
(bridging). Support for the localization of the CO double
bond came from DRIFTS measurements of 2·toluene and
2·thf, which showed the presence of a strong absorption band
at n˜ = 1732 and 1718 cm1, respectively, for the CO stretching
of the CO double bond as well as a strong absorption band at
n˜ = 1336 cm1 for the CO stretching of the CO single bond.
The structure was also supported by NMR spectroscopic
measurements.
The
1H NMR
spectrum
recorded
in
[D8]toluene at ambient temperature revealed two distinct
methyl group environments for all the pyrazolato ligands,
indicative of ligand asymmetry and complete consumption of
[Ce(Me2pz)4]2. The
13C signal of the inserted CO2 was
detected at d = 149.9 ppm, a region where pyrazolate N-
CO2R signals are expected.[26]
1H NMR measurements on
2·thf in [D8]THF at ambient temperature showed a mixture of
products, which could not be assigned. Cooling the solution to
408C under 1 bar CO2 pressure led to a color change from
red to orange and both the 1H and 13C NMR spectra recorded
at 408C showed similar signals as 2·toluene in [D8]toluene.
Variable-temperature (VT) NMR studies of 2·toluene and
2·thf in [D8]toluene and [D8]THF were conducted to inves-
tigate the reversibility of CO2 insertion (Scheme 3). In
[D8]toluene, the formation of a new species at 408C was
revealed and no further liberation of CO2 was observed even
after heating above 608C (see Figure S6 in the Supporting
Information). The 1H NMR spectrum recorded at 408C shows
two sets of signals for different Me2pz moieties in a 1:1 ratio,
which suggests the formation of putative compound [Ce-
(Me2pz)2(Me2pz·CO2)2].
Recooling the solution did not reform 2·toluene quanti-
tatively, likely because some of the liberated CO2 was no
longer within the reaction medium, but the addition of fresh
CO2 quantitatively reformed 2·toluene. The [D8]THF VT
NMR experiment of compound 2·thf showed a different CO2-
deinsertion behavior (see Figure S10). As a consequence of
competitive thf coordination, displacement of CO2 starts at
108C and is complete at 608C, with formation of [Ce(Me2pz)4-
(thf)]. As seen in the experiment in [D8]toluene, this reaction
is fully reversible by recooling the sample and subsequently

The process is completely reversible in [D8]thf and partially reversible
in [D8]toluene. The product arising from the elimination of CO2 in
[D8]toluene has not been isolated; the structure is based on 1H NMR
spectroscopic analysis at 408C.

introducing CO2. Additionally, in situ IR measurements were
performed at 608C, which showed complete loss of inserted
CO2 and formation of free CO2 (Figure 2 and see also
Figure S58).
In the solid state, 2·toluene is stable for several weeks at
408C, but at ambient temperature it partially loses CO2 over
a few days or when it is exposed to vacuum, as indicated by
a color change from orange to dark red. A thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA), performed under a flow of Ar and heating
the sample slowly from 288C to 2508C, indicated an initial
loss of mostly lattice toluene. The liberation of CO2 and small
amounts of lattice toluene was dominant between 55 and
958C, as revealed by a step of 21.92% (theoretical proportion
of CO2 in 2·toluene 19.98%). At 2508C, only nonvolatile parts
of 2·toluene remain, leaving a mass of 49.79% of the initial
weight (theoretical value 51.61%; see Figure S59). Although
the deinsertion of carbon dioxide was achieved in the solid
state, bulk compound 1 did not insert any carbon dioxide
when stored under 1 bar CO2 pressure for three days.
Moreover, compound 1 was hydrolyzed upon exposure to
air within one hour (DRIFT spectrum, see Figure S57).
[Ce(Me2pz)4(thf)] (1-thf) was treated with stoichiometric
amounts
of
CO2
to
generate
the
putative
[Ce-
(Me2pz)2(Me2pz·CO2)2] (Scheme 3). Although this species
could not be isolated, it was possible to generate mono-
inserted [Ce3(Me2pz)9(Me2pz·CO2)3(thf)] (3) in moderate
yields of 46% (Scheme 4). The crystal structure of ceric 3
shows a ring motif with two distinct 9-coordinate and one 10-
coordinate cerium atoms (Figure 3). Although all the cerium
centers are coordinated by three Me2pz ligands in an h2(N,N’)
fashion, Ce1 connects further to two oxygen atoms of
neighboring Me2pz·CO2 ligands as well as an additional thf
molecule, 10-coordinate Ce2 is surrounded by two k2:(N,O)-
chelating Me2pz·CO2 ligands, and Ce3 exhibits additional
contacts to one k2:(N,O)-Me2pz·CO2 ligand and an oxygen
atom of a neighboring Me2pz·CO2 ligand.
Each Me2pz·CO2 ligand bridges between two cerium
atoms. In contrast to homoleptic 2, all the oxygen atoms are
engaged in cerium bonding, which implies delocalized OC
O bonds (av. CO, 1.247 ). The h2(N,N’)-CeN(Me2pz)
bond lengths are in the expected range.[24,27] According to
VT NMR studies carried out in [D8]toluene, the trimetallic
entity 3 is retained in solution at low temperatures, with every
dimethylpyrazolato ligand showing a distinct signal set in the
proton NMR spectrum at 808C (see Figure S12). The signals
for the protons of the bridging Me2pz·CO2 ligands are shifted
upfield compared to those of the terminal h2(N,N’)-Me2pz
ligands. As a consequence of the equilibrium between
potential alternative oligomers formed in the presence of
only one equivalent of CO2 per cerium, the interpretation of
the ambient-temperature NMR spectrum was difficult. This
was already experienced for the insertion of benzophenone
into the CeN(Me2pz) bond.[23] Upon heating to 908C, CO2
was liberated and [Ce(Me2pz)4] re-formed (see Figure S14).
After cooling to ambient temperature, a partial reinsertion of
CO2 was observed, as was found in the VT NMR experiments
on 2·toluene and 2·thf.
Carbon Dioxide Insertion into a Cerous Pyrazolate: To
examine the role of the oxidation state of cerium (CeIV versus
CeIII) and, therefore, the impact of its Lewis acidity, cerous
donor-free [Ce4(Me2pz)12][28] (4) was used as a precursor for
CO2 insertion (Scheme 5). Remarkably, while retaining the

Ce4 nuclearity, all of the CeN(Me2pz) moieties engaged in
CO2 insertion, leading to the complex [Ce4(Me2pz·CO2)12] (5;
Figure 4). Compared to the six different coordination modes
of the pyrazolato moieties in starting material 4,[28] the crystal
structure of 5 revealed only three. Ce2, Ce3, and Ce4 form
a nearly equilateral triangle bridged by m3-1k2(N,O):2k(O):3k-
(O’)-Me2pz·CO2. Each of the 9-coordinate cerium centers
(Ce2, Ce3, and Ce4) is also surrounded by two terminal
Me2pz·CO2 groups in a k2(N,O) coordination mode and two
oxygen atoms in a k2(O,O’) fashion (Figure S66). This triangle
is capped by 9-coordinate Ce1, which is coordinated to three
Me2pz·CO2 ligands in a k2(N,O) manner (Ce1Navg 2.710 ,
Ce1Oavg 2.395 ) and to three bridging oxygen atoms. The
CeO bond lengths are similar to those found in [Ce-
(LR·CO2)3] (LR = 2-O-3,5-tBu2-C6H2(1-C{N(CH)2N(R)}) and
R = iPr and Mes) reported by Arnold et al. with CeO bond
lengths of 2.466(6)–2.482(6) .[18b] The OCO bond lengths
indicate delocalization of the bridging Me2pz·CO2 ligands,
with two CO bond lengths in the same region (1.235(9)–
1.264(9) ) and rather localized CO single (1.26(1)–1.301-
(9) ) and CO double bonds (1.21(1)–1.229(9) ) for the
capping and terminal Me2pz·CO2 ligands. For further com-
parison, the cerous carbamate [Ce4(O2CNiPr2)12] features
a lozenged arrangement of one 8-coordinate and three 7-
coordinate CeIII centers with CeO bond lengths in the range
2.322(7)–2.746(7)
 (no Ce-N interaction).[29] The latter
complex was obtained from the reaction of CeCl3(DME) with
HNiPr2 and CO2 (Scheme 1f). In accordance with the crystal
structure of cluster 5, DRIFTS measurements show strong
absorption bands for both the CO single bonds (n˜ = 1250–
1350 cm1) and CO double bonds (n˜ = 1600–1750 cm1). 1H
DOSY NMR measurements on 5 in [D8]toluene, [D8]THF, or
a [D8]toluene/3,3-dimethyl-1,2-butylene oxide mixture re-
vealed distinct diffusion coefficients (see Figures S17–S20) for
the solvents employed and only one additional peak corre-
sponding to a much larger species but correlating with every
other signal in the proton NMR spectra. Calculation of the
molar
mass
of
this
compound
([D8]toluene:
Mr=
1989 gmol1; [D8]THF: Mr= 1643 gmol1; [D8]toluene +
3,3-dimethyl-1,2-butyleneoxide: Mr= 2357 gmol1) as a com-
pact sphere-like molecule[30] suggests it exists as a tetrametallic
(Mr= 2242 gmol1) or a non-monometallic species in solu-
tion. Treating [Ce(Me2pz)3(thf)]2 with CO2 in [D8]THF gave
the same NMR spectrum as that of 5·toluene, thus indicating
the formation of a multimetallic compound also in donor
solvents (see Figure S16). TGA of 5·toluene also showed an
initial loss of toluene (cf. 2·toluene), followed by a pronounced
step (21.39% weight loss) in the range from 52 to 908C,
consistent with the release of CO2 (theoretical value: 16.75%)
and some lattice toluene (Figure S60). At 2508C, only the
nonvolatile parts of 5·toluene remain and a total loss of
46.82 wt% compared to the starting material fits well
with the theoretical value of 45.99% for 10 molecules
of toluene and 12 molecules of CO2 eliminated from
[Ce4(Me2pz·CO2)12]·10toluene (5·toluene).
Catalytic Formation of Cyclic Carbonates from CO2 and
Oxiranes: Having established the efficiency and reversibility
of CO2 insertion into CeN(Me2pz) bonds, we were interested
in any catalytic utilization. Accordingly, pyrazolate complexes
1 and 4 were probed as catalysts for the generation of cyclic
carbonates from CO2 and oxiranes. In the absence of CO2,
compound 1 interacts with epoxides, as indicated by a notice-
able shift in the 1H NMR spectrum upon addition of one
equivalent
of
3,3-dimethyl-1,2-butylene
oxide
(see
Fig-
ure S24). This is most likely due to formation of a donor
adduct, which is considered a crucial step in Lewis-acid-
catalyzed cycloaddition reactions. Even though such donor
adducts were shown to be isolable (e.g. TptBuCa(O-2,6-
iPr2C6H3)·(PO);
TptBu = tris(3-tBu-pyrazolyl)borato,
PO =
propylene oxide[31]), the putative [Ce(Me2pz)4(PO)] (1-PO)
could not be isolated. Tetra-n-butylammonium bromide
(TBAB) was employed as a co-catalyst, since it was shown
to promote the highest activities in such cycloaddition
reactions.[11b,32] The reaction was optimized for propylene
oxide, which gave almost quantitative conversion after 24 h
under mild conditions. Using 0.5 mol% 1 or 0.25 mol% 4 and

1 mol% TBAB without solvent at ambient temperature and
1 bar CO2 pressure gave 93% conversion for the tetravalent
catalyst 1 and 98% for its trivalent counterpart (Table 1,
entries 1 and 3). The CO2-insertion complexes 2 and 5
displayed similar catalytic activity (entries 2 and 4). The
conversion dropped drastically on increasing the steric bulk of
the substituent on the epoxides. As a result, styrene oxide, and
3,3-dimethyl-1,2-butylene oxide showed only very low con-
versions (entry 21) for ceric 1 and almost no conversion in the
case of trivalent catalyst 4 (entry 22). Moderate conversion
was observed for 1,2-n-hexylene oxide with the tetravalent
catalyst 1 (entry 13). Conducting the catalysis at higher
temperature increased the TONs with both catalysts 1 and
4, and resulted in nearly quantitative conversion for both
systems (entries 15 and 16). Without co-catalyst TBAB,
1 showed moderate catalytic activity at 908C (entry 17). In
almost all cases, tetravalent 1 showed higher catalytic activity
than cerous 4, which most likely results from the higher Lewis
acidity of CeIV versus CeIII. To further evaluate the catalytic
reaction with catalyst 1 and propylene oxide, the TOFs at
different stages of the catalysis were determined (see
Table S1). After a short induction period, most likely
corresponding to the insertion of CO2 into 1, the TOF
reached a maximum of 11 h1 within the first 3 h. For
comparison, a TOF of 155 h1 was reported by Yao and co-
workers when performing the reaction under 10 bar CO2
pressure.[11a] Increasing the CO2 pressure did not significantly
affect the catalytic activity of compound 1 (entries 13 vs. 18
and 21 vs. 23). However, a simultaneous increase of the
temperature to 908C and the CO2 pressure to 10 bar led to
a marked improvement in the catalytic activity, resulting in
TONs of up to 300 for the sterically demanding 3,3-dimethyl-
1,2-butylene oxide (entries 24 and 26). The latter conditions
were also applicable for the cycloaddition of CO2 and
cyclohexene oxide, an internal epoxide (entries 27–29). Hav-
ing optimized the reaction conditions, we determined the
initial turnover frequencies for the different epoxides (en-
tries 5, 12, 20, and 25). As expected, the TOFs increased as the
steric of the substituents bulk decreased, ranging from 24 to
196 h1 and giving almost quantitative conversion of propyl-
ene oxide after a reaction time of one hour (entry 5).
Compared to the other catalyst systems based on rare-earth
metals reported by Yao and co-workers (TOFs up to 440 h1)
or by Otero and co-workers (3167 h1), our system shows only
moderate catalytic activity under comparable conditions.[11a,b]
The mechanism of the cycloaddition of CO2 and epoxides
using tetraalkylammonium salts as co-catalysts has been
discussed in detail.[32,33] It is generally accepted that the
epoxide is activated by coordination to a Lewis-acidic metal
center followed by a nucleophilic ring-opening attack of the
bromide to form a metal-alkoxy bond (Scheme 6). Subse-
quently, the alkoxide reacts with CO2 and cyclizes to produce
a cyclic carbonate. Hints that the mechanisms for the
cycloaddition differ using ceric 1 or cerous 4 as the catalyst
could be found when conducting the reactions with different
amounts of catalyst loading (entries 7 and 9). This results in
a change in the TONs for the tetravalent catalyst 1, whereas
the TONs remained the same for trivalent complex 4. The
occurrence of distinct reaction mechanisms is not surprising,
as 1 is a monometallic complex while 4 is a tetrametallic
compound in the solid state and in solution (for a more
detailed possible mechanism see Scheme S1). Such a mecha-
nism, involving multiple metal centers, was previously pro-
posed for the bimetallic complex [Al(salen)]2O by North and
co-workers.[32] However, any detailed information about the
mechanism could not be retrieved from our catalyst system as
the TOFs decreased enormously when the reactions were
conducted in propylene carbonate (no significant conversion
at ambient temperature after 24 h and ca. 10% conversion
after 20 h at 908C) or any other solvent, which makes kinetic
studies unfeasible.

Complex 2 underwent a reductive side reaction in
the
presence
of
TBAB
to
afford
cerous
species
[Ce(Me2pz·CO2)4][NBu4] (6). This side reaction occurred
during the catalytic studies and when combining 1 and TBAB
in stoichiometric amounts in [D8]toluene under 1 bar CO2
pressure. Although 2 is very stable in toluene solution under
these conditions (no color change was observed after several
days), it underwent reduction in the presence of TBAB within
hours, as evidenced by decolorization of the orange solution.
Most probably bromine is formed as an oxidation product;
however, no brominated product could be detected in the
reaction mixture (see Figure S23). The use of epoxides as
a solvent seems to stabilize the tetravalent 2, as no para-
magnetic signals were found in the 1H NMR spectra of the
catalytic reactions. The crystal structure of 6 revealed the
same motif as seen in 2·toluene and 2·thf (see Figure S67).
The
8-coordinate
cerium
center
bears
four
k2(N,O)
Me2pz·CO2 ligands with elongated CeN and CeO bonds
compared to ceric 2·toluene and 2·thf, as would be expected
for a cerium(III) center. Cerous 6 displays poor catalytic
activity compared to tetravalent 1 (Table 1, entry 19), thus
underlining that it is a side product and not the active catalyst.
Conclusion
We have shown that carbon dioxide easily inserts into the
CeN(Me2pz) bond of both ceric [Ce(Me2pz)4]2 and cerous
[Ce4(Me2pz)12] at an amount equivalent to 5.7 mmol CO2 per
gram complex and via the controlled activation of 12
molecules of CO2 within one complex, respectively. The
insertion process is reversible both in solution and in the solid
state, with CO2 desorption being complete at < 1008C. Both
trivalent and tetravalent cerium pyrazolate complexes are
active catalysts for the cycloaddition of epoxides and carbon
dioxide with TBAB as a co-catalyst under mild conditions. We
are currently investigating the carbon dioxide capture per-
formance of silica-grafted variants of Ce-pyrazolates,[34] and
our findings might also stimulate research in the area of
cerium-dipyrazolate-based
CO2-“breathable”/expandable
MOFs.[35,36]
