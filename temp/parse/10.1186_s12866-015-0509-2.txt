Abstract
Background: Symbiosis defective GacA-mutant derivatives of Vibrio fischeri are growth impaired thereby creating a
selective advantage for growth-enhanced spontaneous suppressors. Suppressors were isolated and characterized for
effects of the mutations on gacA-mutant defects of growth, siderophore activity and luminescence. The mutations
were identified by targeted and whole genome sequencing.
Results: Most mutations that restored multiple phenotypes were non-null mutations that mapped to conserved
domains in or altered expression of CsrA, a post-transcriptional regulator that mediates GacA effects in a number of
bacterial species. These represent an array of unique mutations compared to those that have been described
previously. Different substitutions at the same amino acid residue were identified allowing comparisons of effects
such as at the R6 residue, which conferred relative differences in luminescence and siderophore levels. The screen
revealed residues not previously identified as critical for function including a single native alanine. Most csrA
mutations enhanced luminescence more than siderophore activity, which was especially evident for mutations
predicted to reduce the amount of CsrA. Although CsrA mutations compensate for many known GacA mutant
defects, not all CsrA suppressors restore symbiotic colonization. Phenotypes of a suppressor allele of ihfA that
encodes one subunit of the integration host factor (IHF) heteroduplex indicated the protein represses siderophore
and activates luminescence in a GacA-independent manner.
Conclusions: In addition to its established role in regulation of central metabolism, the CsrA regulator represses
luminescence and siderophore as an intermediate of the GacA regulatory hierachy. Siderophore regulation was
less sensitive to stoichiometry of CsrA consistent with higher affinity for the targets of this trait. The lack of CsrA
null-mutant recovery implied these mutations do not enhance fitness of gacA mutants and alluded to this gene
being conditionally essential. This study also suggests a role for IHF in the GacA-CsrB-CsrA regulatory cascade by
potentially assisting with the binding of repressors of siderohphore and activators of luminescence. As many
phosphorelay proteins reduce fitness when mutated, the documented instability used in this screen also highlights
a potentially universal and underappreciated problem that, if not identified and strategically avoided, could
introduce confounding variability during experimental study of these regulatory pathways.

Background
During host colonization, bacteria use complex regulatory
hierarchies to orchestrate the adaptive changes that are
necessary to bypass host defenses and secure nutrients.
For many bacterial species, the GacA regulator directs the
expression of multiple, disparate traits important for
colonization, primarily by activating the transcription of
several non-coding CsrB regulatory RNAs that sequester
CsrA, a regulator that binds and influences translation or
stability of target mRNAs [1–3]. Many defects conferred
by mutations in GacA homologs are due to their inability
to relieve CsrA repression of key transcripts involved in
central metabolism, motility, and virulence [4–9]. For
squid light organ symbiotic Vibrio fischeri, GacA is re-
quired for normal metabolism, motility, siderophore-
mediated iron sequestration, and production of the key
symbiosis factor luminescence, which provides protect-
ive counter-illumination camouflage for its squid host
[10, 11]. The metabolic defects of GacS/GacA mutants in
culture recently revealed accumulation of citrate as a poten-
tial signal for GacS in a cascade whereby GacA activates
the expression of csrB1 and csrB2 to antagonize CsrA, and
linked regulation of metabolisms to luminescence [12]. In
the absence of GacA,V. fischeri is impaired in the early ini-
tiation stages of host colonization, and is unable to achieve
robust growth within light organs, thereby only rarely
reaching large enough populations to induce low levels of
luminescence via quorum sensing [10]. Although the im-
portance of GacA to squid symbiosis has been established
and its relation to CsrA appears conserved and has already
revealed important insights into the pathway [12], the ex-
tent of CsrA interaction with targets in the complex GacA
regulatory hierarchy are not yet fully elucidated.
Even though characterization of global regulators
like GacA provides an opportunity to simultaneously
identify multiple phenotypes involved in colonization
and elucidate the signal transduction cascades that
direct the complex colonization process, their plei-
otropy creates challenges for their study. Even though
many defects in gacA mutants in culture, including
altered luminescence, motility and siderophore pro-
duction, are not detrimental under most laboratory
conditions, gacA mutants’ associated growth defects
reduce fitness [10, 13] which could provide strong
selection for secondary mutations that allow escape
from the defect, known as suppression. Depending on
whether suppressor mutations dramatically change the ap-
pearance or behavior of mutants, they may go unnoticed
and undetected without whole genome re-sequencing.
Suppression, when applied in a genetic screen, is a
powerful tool for identifying interacting partner proteins,
domains of importance in protein activity and specificity,
and associated defects that provide biological insight
[14]. Here we characterize a high frequency suppression
phenomena observed in gacA mutants of V. fischeri that
allowed the characterization of effects of a broader
distribution of csrA mutations than previously. Genetic
analysis of the naturally occurring gacA suppressors indi-
cates that the suppressor mutations reduced the amount
or function of the CsrA post-transcriptional regulator,
consistent with an epistatic relationship of CsrA below
GacA in its regulatory hierarchy. The screen also impli-
cates the integration host factor (IHF) heterodimer as a
potential mediator of GacA-CsrA regulation. Our results
suggest that null mutations in CsrA are not tolerated in V.
fischeri even in the absence of its regulator, GacA.
Results and discussion
Phenotypic suppression of gacA mutants occurs through
the selective growth advantage conferred by
spontaneous csrA mutations
If the GacA regulatory hierarchy of V. fischeri parallels
that in other species, pleiotropic defects caused by their
inability to antagonize CsrA could be restored by loss of
function of csrA (VF0538). Unfortunately, our attempts
to test this hypothesis by allelic replacement of the
native csrA gene with several csrA-mutant constructs
in more than 10,000 recombinants generated in both
gacA+ (wild-type) and gacA mutant backgrounds were
unsuccessful. This was unexpected given that even
difficult-to-achieve mutants with growth defects are
typically recovered with screening only a few hundred
putative recombinant bacteria [10]. Random transposon
mutagenesis also failed to generate a csrA::TnErm mutant.
Even with the failure of these attempts, several days after
growth of ΔgacA::Km or gacA::TnKm mutants on agar
media, suppressors with enhanced growth appeared as lar-
ger, yellow and opaque colonies (Fig. 1). These suppressors
arose to a high proportion in broth cultures after growth
to stationary phase where gacA mutants exhibit a severe
growth yield defect, but they were rarely detected during
exponential growth, consistent with the observation that
gacA mutants exhibit the same exponential growth rate
[10, 15]. Identification of the source mutations conferring
spontaneous suppression could reveal intermediates of the
GacA regulatory pathway, potentially including CsrA.
Based on the premise that defects in csrA could
suppress gacA mutant phenotypes, especially growth
[12], we isolated suppressors that arose in VCW2F5
(ΔgacA::Km), VCW2A1 (gacA::TnKm) and a suppres-
sor mutant VCW2E2 (gacA::TnKmsup(ihfAS2)) which
was identified for its enhanced colony size and opacity
on CAS agar (Fig. 1). Strain VCW2E2 was used in this
screen to assess whether the unidentified primary sup-
pressor mutation in this derivative would promote the
accumulation of a unique distribution of secondary
suppressor mutations that would potentially allow us
to capture additional informative targets for study. Sixty-

four derivatives, including a single derivative (VCW2E3)
that was isolated from an unusually luminous gacA-colo-
nized squid, were recovered and the csrA gene sequenced.
All but one derivative with multiple suppressed phenotypes
had acquired a mutation in the csrA gene indicating most
GacA phenotypes are CsrA mediated (Table 1). No csrA
mutations were identified from 17 derivatives grown under
the same conditions that were phenotypically indistinguish-
able from the parental strain. Sequencing of the csrB1 and
csrB2 genes [12, 16], encoding the GacA-activiated sRNAs
that bind and sequester CsrA [17] in VCW9D1 revealed it
harbored a single nucleotide insertion upstream of csrB2
(Table 1). Consistent with the predicted role of CsrB2 as an
antagonist of CsrA, the most probable explanation is that
this suppressor mutation enhanced expression of the gene,
thereby decreasing CsrA activity. Finally, whole genome re-
sequencing of VCW2E2 revealed a single nucleotide substi-
tution within ihfA (allele ihfAS2) conferring a predicted
R60G amino acid substitution that was not harbored by the
parental strain (Table 1, See Methods). In agreement with
ihfA being regulated by CsrA and thus a potential source
for suppression, the transcript of this gene co-purified with
CsrA in E.coli [18]. Once suppressor mutations were identi-
fied, probable siblings were excluded from further analysis
resulting in a collection of 45 independently derived sup-
pressor mutants, 43 of which mapped to csrA (Table 1).
Distribution of spontaneous csrA mutations suggested
reduced activity rather than null CsrA mutations
enhanced gacA mutant fitness
Several informative patterns of acquired mutations in csrA
became apparent from the distribution and types of spon-
taneous mutations. Independently-derived identical muta-
tions were recovered at nucleotide position 14, 17 and 44
and all possible substitutions were recovered at position
16, suggesting the screen was near saturation for muta-
tions in csrA that provide a fitness benefit (Table 1). The
only
frame-shift
mutations,
all
generated
by
single
nucleotide deletions, mapped within the sequence encod-
ing the last 10 amino acids which are absent in some nat-
urally
occurring
CsrA
homologs
(e.g.,
RsmA
from
Pseudomonas putida [19]), and each of these were pre-
dicted to extend rather than truncate the CsrA protein.
No other missense or non-sense mutations that altered or
truncated the CsrA protein in these 10 amino acids were
recovered, suggesting their loss would not impair CsrA
function and thus were not predicted to compensate for
the gacA mutants’ inability to relieve CsrA repression
(Table 1). However, two point mutations that caused trun-
cations of 12 and 14 amino acids were recovered (Table 1).
Interestingly, all insertions/duplications maintained the
original reading frame. Since frame-shift mutations along
with nonsense mutations have a high potential to elimin-
ate protein function (except in the C-terminus, as de-
scribed) the most plausible explanation for their absence
is that null csrA mutations did not improve gacA mutant
fitness. The remaining mutations in the csrA ORF were
missense point mutations (Table 1).
Many of the mutations mapped to conserved regions
consistent with these impairing CsrA function. Several
mutations mapped near the conserved HA RNA-binding
motif, and one even in the valine in this motif (GVxG),
which would agree with previous studies that suggest
conservation in this valine is not essential [20, 21].
Twelve mutations mapped to the 2 critical subdomains
of conserved amino acids essential to CsrA function
(Fig. 2) referred to as region 1 and region 2 [20]. Nine of
those mapped to region 1 located in the β1 sheet, and
only three to the less conserved region 2 in the β5 sheet
(Fig. 2) and these, based on phenotype, only modestly
impaired CsrA function as did mutations that caused
changes in the C-terminal alpha helix (Fig. 2).
Eight mutations were predicted to change expression,
rather than alter function of CsrA (Fig. 3). Among these
were a single point mutation that altered the initiation
codon from ATG to the documented alternative start

Fig. 2 Location of suppressor mutations that mapped to the inferred CsrA protein within conserved regions and the resulting phenotypes
relative to wildtype ES114. The native CsrA protein sequence of ES114 was aligned with the secondary structure consensus (β1-5 and α1) and
identified conserved sequences [20, 23] that are region 1, the HA RNA binding GxxG motif, and region 2 (highlighted in blue with yellow text). For
each suppressor the deduced native amino acid (column AA) and predicted amino acid substitution, insertion, deletion or elongation is first
identified below the consensus in orange text. For native amino acid position, “+” indicates an insertion of the amino acid described, and a “++”
signifies frame shift mutations in every case altering more than 10 aa, and all conferring a protein extension (see Table 1). Growth on minimal
agar media which was supplemented with glycerol or N-acetylglucosamine is designated by “+” for growth and “-“no growth. Growth yield
(OD600) is expressed as a percent of wildtype grown overnight in SWT. Blue bars are percent siderophore levels and yellow bars percent
luminescence relative to wildtype, where error bars represent 95 % confidence intervals using 5–8 replicates. The names of the strains are color

codon ATT [22], which could alter the efficiency of
translation initiation of a full length csrA. Though there
is an alternative in-frame start codon downstream of this
location, its use would generate a 12 amino acid N-
terminal truncated protein and remove previously defined
region 1 [20, 23, 24]. One large upstream deletion elimi-
nated the predicted native promoter and altered the
Shine-Dalgarno, but semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed
csrA transcript was still produced from this mutant (data
not shown). Even without its native promoter, the tran-
script could be expressed from an alternative promoter of
the upstream aspartate kinase gene VF_0537. The aggre-
gate data indicated that null mutations in csrA were not
recovered in this suppressor screen, providing credence
that csrA mutations are highly deleterious.
Spontaneous csrA mutations typically enhanced
luminescence to a greater extent than siderophore
In GacA−derivatives, mutations in csrA simultaneously
restored growth on the simple sugars, restored growth
yield in rich medium, restored siderophore production
and often greatly enhanced luminescence (Figs. 2 and 3)
[10]. The lack of relative differences for growth yield and
utilization of simple sugars contrasts with the highly
variable degree of luminescence and siderophore enhance-
ment observed in different suppressors. Furthermore, the
relative improvement in luminescence and siderophore ac-
tivity often did not correlate with each other (Figs. 2 and 3),
which has also been reported for different CsrA-regulated
traits in E. coli [20]. Siderophore activity was on average
restored to wild-type levels with a range of 0.2 to 10-fold
the wild-type level, and was greater in only 36 % of suppres-
sors. Luminescence much more often surpassed wild-type
levels, on average 6-fold, with a minimum of 0.1 and a
maximum of 32-fold. Whereas 95 % of the csrA mutations
fully restored luminescence, only 60 % restored siderophore
activity to wild-type levels. The general trend of greater
relative increase in luminescence than for siderophore ac-
tivity with CsrA-impairment may allude to a higher binding
affinity
of
CsrA
to
regulatory
target(s)
that
govern
siderophore: a siderophore defect remained in many sup-
pressors despite mutations that presumably impaired CsrA
function. However, other regulatory changes in gacA mu-
tants may act synergistically with reduced csrA repression
in the complex regulation of luminescence. Interestingly,
half of the suppressors with 20-fold or more increased
luminescence over wild-type harbored mutations that we
predict resulted in decreased levels of wild-type CsrA
Fig. 3 Suppressor mutations predicted to reduce expression of wild-type CsrA. Fold siderophore (blue bars) and fold luminescence (yellow bars)
relative to wild-type ES114 are shown for gacA mutants and suppressors, where error bars indicate 95 % confidence intervals of 5–8 replicates.
Growth on minimal media agar supplemented with glycerol or N-acetylglucosamine is designated for each strain by “+” for growth and “-“for no
growth. Growth yield (OD600) is expressed as a percent of wildtype grown overnight in SWT. For each suppressor the csrA mutation precedes the
row identifying whether a promoter, Shine-Dalgarno (SD), alternative start codon, or silent mutation subject to codon bias [52] is the predicted
cause of decreased expression. The names of the strains are color coded by genetic background as described in Table 1

suggesting CsrA binding of mRNA substrate(s) for this trait
was especially sensitive to stoichiometry and would agree
with a lower affinity (Figs. 2 and 3) although other explana-
tions are possible and this hypothesis may be tested once
targets are identified. One mutation that enhanced lumi-
nescence more than 24-fold (A36S), did not map to any
conserved domain. A valine substitution at this same pos-
ition that arose in the presence of the ihfAS2 allele did not
enhance luminescence and suggested it only modestly
impaired CsrA function, although the ihfAS2 allele could
influence this phenotype separately from CsrA.
The colony opacity-enhancing ihfA mutation increased
siderophore and attenuated luminescence of isolates that
harbored csrA mutant alleles
The primary
ihfAS2 suppressor mutation in strain
VCW2E2 had no restorative effect on luminescence, and
only slightly increased siderophore production and growth
(Fig. 2), but analysis of gacA csrA suppressor mutants
either harboring or lacking the ihfAS2 mutation (triple
and double mutants respectively) revealed a striking pat-
tern. Most ihfAS2 mutants surpassed wild type for sidero-
phore activity and all three mutants with a greater
increase in siderophore than luminescence levels harbored
the ihfAS2 allele. In support of this conclusion, a suppres-
sor harboring an ihfAS2 mutation and a csrA allele with a
predicted R6L substitution (VCW9D2) produced more
than twice as much siderophore as a suppressor with the
same csrA allele without the ihfAS2 mutation (VCW9H6).
Three triple mutants also surpassed wild type for growth
yield (Figs. 2 and 3). Luminescence was attenuated in
triple mutants compared to double mutants with the same
csrA alleles (i.e., VCW6C6 and VCW9E2).
As a part of the heterodimeric integration host factor
(IHF) protein, IhfA is a global regulator that bends DNA
and facilitates recognition and binding of regulatory pro-
teins thereby influences diverse functions [25]. Because
the GacA ortholog of Legionella pneumophila represses
IHF [26], reduced function of IHF does provide a simple
explanation for suppression if that hierarchy were con-
served in V. fischeri and some gacA mutant defects were
due to overproduction of IHF and enhanced regulatory
protein binding. If this hypothesis is true, few defects
(e.g., colony translucence) of gacA mutants resulted from a
lack of ihfA repression alone. Alternatively, the spontaneous
ihfAS2 mutation may only modestly alter IHF function,
which would be expected for an important global regulator.
The associated phenotypes of the ihfAS2 allele are
consistent with a role for IHF in co-activation of the lux
luminescence operon, and co-repression of the iuc
siderophore biosynthetic operon through its ability to
enhance the binding of regulatory proteins related to
these traits. Because there is an established precedent
for IHF mediating activation of csrB gene homologs in
other species [27, 28], the reduced luminescence of csrA
mutant strain harboring the ihfAS2 allele suggests IHF
could promote csrB1 and csrB2 gene expression and
positive regulation of lux independently of GacA activa-
tion of these genes. However, other mechanisms for IHF
activation of lux are possible. In Vibrio vulnificus IHF
works in partnership with the LitR ortholog (SmcR) to
activate virulence-associated vvpE [26, 29] suggesting
IHF activation of luminescence in V. fischeri could occur
through the promotion of binding of the quorum sens-
ing regulator LitR thereby enhancing expression of LuxR
and in turn the lux operon. The effect of ihfAS2 on
siderophore activity was consistent with several studies
that report transcripts related to iron acquisition are
increased by IhfA mutations [26, 30, 31]. The ferric
uptake regulator, Fur, and ArcA are the most likely can-
didates for the co-repression of siderophore with IHF, as
other studies report IHF enhancement of aerobic Fur re-
pression, and in the absence of Fur enhancement of
anaerobic repression by ArcA [32, 33]. Additional stud-
ies to determine whether these or other mechanisms are
at play in IHF activation and repression are warranted.
Newly identified patterns of altered function from
comparison of the effects of spontaneous csrA mutations
with those achieved by alanine scan in CsrA of Escherichia
coli
A previously applied alanine-scanning mutagenesis that
was performed with the E. coli csrA gene, used to exam-
ine the relative contribution each amino acid residue to
CsrA protein function [20], provides an invaluable com-
parator to our spontaneous suppression screen. Our
complementary screen differs in that all potential amino
acid substitutions are possible, even the single native
alanine residue that was not altered in the alanine scan.
In our screen, an A36S substitution caused a 20-fold
increase in luminescence and restored siderophore activ-
ity indicating the highly conserved A36, positioned into
the hydrophobic core of the CsrA homodimer, could be
critical to protein folding and 3- dimensional stability
[20, 23]. Even the conservative substitution of this alanine
with the non-polar and fairly compact valine (VCW2G2)
altered CsrA function (Fig. 2). Also, only mutations that im-
prove growth would likely improve fitness. Thus, mutations
that map to non-conserved regions that do not contribute
to critical protein folding, dimerization, or RNA binding
were not recovered, as described previously with the lack of
C-terminal truncations. Finally, the screen also dictates that
mutations that further impair fitness of the double gacA
csrA mutant would not be recovered. For example, if the
CsrA protein was essential, then none of the spontaneous
mutations should eliminate CsrA function. The lack of mu-
tations in highly conserved residues of functional domains,
especially for the two guanidine residues of the GxxG HA

Page 7 of 14
motif, the absence of frame-shift mutations (except in the
last 10 non-essential amino acids), and the detection of a
csrA transcript in the promoter-deletion mutant with one
of most dramatic suppressor phenotypes implies no mutant
recovered harbors a null allele and supports our interpret-
ation that CsrA may be essential under the conditions of
this screen in V. fischeri. Until recently, CsrA was not
thought to be essential in most bacterial species [34]; how-
ever, among the many published csrA mutants, several have
insertions near the C-terminus of the protein [35, 36], and
such mutations could alter rather than eliminate activity.
One report now suggests that CsrA is conditionally essen-
tial in E. coli [34].
The suppressor screen recovered 8 mutants with
mutations that effected the two predicted regions essen-
tial to CsrA function, that were confirmed by the alanine
scan [20]. Seven were substitutions in amino acids in
conserved region 1 that is essential to CsrA function
(L2, I3, L4, T5, R6, R7), and a single predicted amino
acid insertion in the less conserved region 2 (V40, S41,
V42, H43, R44, E45, E46, I47) [20] (Fig. 2). Two possible
explanations for the relatively low recovery of suppressor
mutations mapping to region 2 are that there are more
neutral amino acid substitutions in this more variable re-
gion whereas any non-neutral mutations may generate
null alleles. Another explanation is that amino acid sub-
stitutions in region 2 are well tolerated, and few impair
CsrA function enough to confer suppression. Targeted
mutagenesis may elucidate whether one of these possi-
bilities is true, although this would be best accomplished
through heterologous expression in E. coli, given the dif-
ficulties in generating a csrA null mutation in V. fischeri
and the impaired growth that multi-copy csrA confers of
the wild-type ES114 [17].
Suppressors with CsrA mutations in R6 had dramatic
phenotypes, implying it is especially critical to CsrA
function and is in agreement with the alanine mutagen-
esis screen in E.coli [20]. The CsrA R6A mutation in
E.coli positively affects expression of all transcripts mea-
sured, including highly enhanced glgCA and pgaA ex-
pression, and modest increase of flhDC expression [20].
To reduce the confounding phenotypes already de-
scribed, our focus was only on suppressor mutants lack-
ing the ihfAS2 primary mutation, leaving three different
suppressors available for comparison at this site. The
R6C substitution enhanced levels of both siderophore
and luminescence (~10-fold wild type). Whereas R6L,
which is likely a more neutral substitution as both amino
acids contain charged side chains, had a similar effect on
luminescence, but only restored siderophore activity to
wild-type levels; thus, this substitution conferred less im-
pairment on CsrA regulation of siderophore activity.
The R6S substitution also resulted in wild-type lumines-
cence implying repression of luminescence was not
substantially impaired by this mutation, but siderophore
activity increased to 3-fold over wild-type, indicating a
greater dysfunction of siderophore repression. That dif-
ferent amino acid substitutions at the same position
could influence relative regulation of two different traits,
likely through different target transcripts, would not
have been revealed by an alanine scan and the basis of
these differences warrants further investigation.
In E.coli, alanine substitutions in some regions of CsrA
had differential influence on certain transcripts, rather
than generally affecting function [20]. Substitutions in
residues 18–23, and 31–38 differentially affected biofilm
formation, and 11–14 and 22 differentially affected
glycogen accumulation and motility [18]. Focusing on
only mutants lacking the ihfAS2 mutation, there were
five suppressors with CsrA mutations in the biofilm-
specific residues and one with a mutation in the glyco-
gen/motility specific residues identified in the E. coli
CsrA. All six of these mutations resulted in moderate to
severe dysfunction of luminescence regulation (wild type
levels to 10-fold higher than wild type). Among the
phenotype-dependent residues identified, two mutations
falling in the biofilm-specific residues, 31–38, were
among the nine suppressors with fully restored or in-
creased siderophore activity. Thus, the previously identi-
fied
biofilm-specific
residues
appear
to
contribute
substantially to siderophore regulation in V.fischeri.
Mutations that we propose decreased levels of wild-type
CsrA (Fig. 3) and all C-terminal alterations (Fig. 2), had
only moderate effects on siderophore activity suggesting
these did not interfere as much with siderophore regula-
tion as they did with luminescence regulation.
No suppressors were recovered with CsrA mutations
in any of the positions where alanine substitution in
E.coli affected CsrA levels as would happen if they de-
creased the stability of the transcript or protein trigger-
ing more rapid turnover [20]. Alanine substitutions at
positions 18, 20, 34, 52, and 55 lowers CsrA levels, how-
ever the mutants have wild-type levels of activity [20].
Our results implied that if substitutions of residues other
than alanine at these positions also reduce production,
they do not impair function enough to confer suppres-
sion. Approximately 16 positions in CsrA cause a de-
crease in its production when substituted with alanine
and also decreased activity [20]. Three suppressors in
position 5, 11 and 15 were recovered indicating non-
alanine substitutions at these same sites similarly im-
paired activity.

organs, two csrA suppressors, one that modestly reduced
CsrA activity based on its phenotypes (VCW9F6) and
one that dramatically reduced CsrA production that also
harbored the ihfAS2 allele (VCW9A1), were evaluated
for colonization along with wild-type (ES114), gacA mu-
tants
(VCW2A1,
VCW2F5)
and
ihfAS2
suppressor
(VCW2E2). The ΔgacA, the gacA::TnKmsup(ihfAS2) and
the gacA::TnKmsup(ihfAS2 csrAE) mutants were unable to
colonize squid in two replicate experiments (Table 2). Only
wild-type and strain VCW9F6 (gacA::TnKmsup(ihfAS2 csrAAO))
with modestly reduced CsrA function and no ihfAS2
mutation
colonized
squid
and
achieved
the
same
colonization rate assessed at 24 h. These data indicate that
the ihfA mutation alone does not restore phenotypes re-
sponsible for squid colonization deficiencies conferred by
the gacA::TnKm mutation, but may also allude to IhfA
function in colonization. Certainly, the observed lumines-
cence attenuation could impact sustained colonization, al-
though this trait is not necessary for initiation measured
here [37]. But, an IHF binding site is predicted in the syp
locus, which is responsible for the symbiotic polysaccharide,
an essential component of a successful initiation, suggesting
a possible link of this regulator to squid colonization [38].
Elucidation of the role of IHF in colonization is certainly
warranted by this study. The inability of the suppressor that
dramatically reduced CsrA function to colonize could imply
that even though GacA likely antagonizes CsrA, its activity
is important during some of the colonization process. That
only the modestly suppressed gacA mutant (VCW9F6) was
able to colonize squid and only a weak suppressor allele has
been recovered from squid light organs (VCW2E3) pro-
vides some support for this interpretation in that these mu-
tants retain relatively more native CsrA function based on
their in vitro phenotypes (Fig. 2). Other unique suppressors
from light organ populations were not available for com-
parison, as they were not recovered over the ten year period
of this study. This was likely in part due to care with pre-
paring inoculum once the suppression phenomenon was
observed. But given the ease at which suppressors are de-
rived and recovered in culture, their absence from animal
studies does agree with the conclusion that CsrA plays a
positive role during colonization. Finally, even though strain
VCW9F6 has ~4 times greater luminescence than ES114 in
culture, it has only modestly, and not significantly, en-
hanced in luminescence in light organs (Table 2). That loss
of CsrA does not enhance luminescence to the same degree
in light organs that it does in culture suggested CsrA is re-
pressed in squid compared to culture.
Conclusions
The CsrA homologs have been described in many bac-
terial species where they affect behaviors essential for
host association, as now inferred in V. fischeri as an
intermediary of GacA regulation of multiple symbiosis-
related traits [9, 12, 17, 39]. Particularly focused in vitro
analysis of the CsrA protein in a few target species such
as E. coli has provided insight into structure-function of
this post-transcriptional regulator [19]. This study com-
plements those in that the nature of the selective screen
allowed the evaluation of effects of a wider array of ac-
cessible mutations that alter function and expression.
We expect several mutations identified in this screen
will provide targets of interest for further analysis in
other species where full null alleles can be generated,
which has not yet been possible in V. fischeri. Although
those other systems facilitate such analysis, there are still
limitations for extending the in vitro analysis in model
organisms such as E. coli to biologically relevant models
for animal infection where these regulatory cascades play
a role. For V. fischeri, the traits under control of the
GacA-CsrA cascade facilitated the colonization process
of an accessible host, and revealed subtle differences
(e.g., luminescence) in the host compared to in vitro
analysis. Expanded analysis will likely identify new regu-
latory partners and mediators of the cascade, such as
IHF identified in this screen. Upon identification of the
regulatory targets of CsrA that controlled siderophore
activity and luminescence, both of which are established
as important in this symbiotic model, the potential dif-
ferences in affinity for targets may be elucidated both in

vitro and in vivo. Thus, this study sets the stage for fur-
ther analysis of the regulatory hierarchy and regulation
in a natural host context that cannot be fully extrapo-
lated from in vitro results alone but at the same time,
builds upon the wealth of knowledge gained from its
study in model laboratory systems.
Methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions
Two previously described gacA mutants generated in the
squid symbiotic strain ES114, VCW2A1 and VCW2F5
[10], were used for isolation of suppressors (Table 1).
Eschericia coli strains for cloning and plasmid propaga-
tion included DH5α, and Top10 (for pCR2.1TOPO)
(Invitrogen). V. fischeri was grown in SWT [40], LBS
[41], or minimal media derived from CAS solid agar
[42] at 28 °C. Media were occasionally supplemented
with kanamycin (Km) at 50 μg/ml or chloramphenicol
(Ch) at 25 μg/ml for E. coli or 2.5 μg/ml for V.
fischeri to hold selection on the presence of resistance
cassettes.
Directed mutagenesis
Directed mutagenesis of csrA (VF0538) was attempted
through several standard methods, including those that
utilize homologous recombination as described previ-
ously [43]. A deletion construct was generated by fusing
1.2 kb of the upstream sequence to 0.3 kb of the down-
stream sequence of csrA by PCR SOE (Table 3) [44]. Al-
though having only 300 bp of DNA flanking one side of
the deletion likely reduces efficiency of recombination,
other mutants have been successfully generated with less
than 200 bp of flanking DNA [10]. This strategy was ne-
cessary due to the presence of multiple tRNA genes im-
mediately downstream of csrA. The presence of these
highly repetitive sequences in an earlier construct facili-
tated recombination of the plasmid at a number of in-
correct
sites in the V. fischeri genome. Following
successful deletion of csrA in the amplicon, the PCR
product was subcloned into a suicide vector, pEVS79
[43] generating plasmid pAEB1A3. A second construct
was made where KmR from pMKm [45] was inserted
into a single EcoRI site immediately upstream of csrA
generating plasmid pAEB3A6 which would aid in selec-
tion of mutants having undergone allele replacement.
The mutations were introduced into the genomes of
wild-type V. fischeri and the gacA mutant by conjugation
and derivatives with single crossovers were isolated by
plating on LBS Ch grown for 24 h at room temperature,
which enriches for V. fischeri. Individual colonies of V.
fischeri were streak purified onto LBS Ch for plasmid
pAEB1A3, or LBS Km for plasmid pAEB3A6 recombi-
nants, and the location of the crossover on either side of
the

RsmAF3 and RsmAR4 (Table 3). Derivatives with cross-
overs within the 300 bp (downstream) flanking DNA
were then grown without selection allowing second
crossovers to occur. Derivatives of pAEB1A3 plated on
LBS, and derivatives of pAEB3A6 plated on LBS Km,
were then screened for loss of ChR by replica plating in-
dicating a second crossover event. Putative mutants
(ChS) were then screened by PCR for gene deletion
using primers RsmAF3 and RsmAR4 (Table 3). In 5200
mutants evaluated, no derivative harboring the csrA de-
letion was ever identified.
After consideration that null mutations harbored by
these constructs may be lethal, we attempted to introduce
a transposon in the extreme C-terminus of csrA at nucleo-
tide 148 as confirmed by sequencing using the EZ::TN™<
Kan-2 > Insertion Kit following the manufacturers proto-
cols (Epicentre) generating plasmid (pJCM24). The trans-
poson was inserted at five amino acids downstream of
the mutation generated in E. coli [35]. Conjugation and
isolation of single crossover derivatives was done, and
confirmed by PCR using primers RsmAF3 and RsmAR7
with Kan-2 FP-1 (Table 3). Following second crossover
events and loss of the previously integrated mutagenic
plasmid, PCR screening with primers RsmAF3 and
RsmAR7 with Kan fp-1 (Table 3) of 5000 Kmr Chs de-
rivatives revealed no csrA::TnKm mutants were ever
generated.
Isolation and identification of spontaneous suppressors
Spontaneous GacA suppressor mutants harboring un-
known mutations were isolated from late log and sta-
tionary phase cultures of either the ΔgacA mutant or
gacA::TnKm that were subsequently plated onto LBS or
CAS agar and allowed to incubate for approximately
72 h. Large, opaque colonies on LBS or CAS, or sidero-
phore producing colonies with orange halos on CAS
agar were isolation streaked onto LBS agar, individual
colonies grown in LBS to md-log phase, and immediately
stored in 15 % glycerol at −80 °C. For all derivatives re-
stored in one or more phenotype, DNA was extracted [46]
and the csrA gene was amplified using Expand HiFi poly-
merase (Roche) using csrA-specific forward (RmsAF8) and
reverse (RmsAR9) primers (Table 3) and the PCR product
directly sequenced by the Hubbard Center for Genome
Studies at the University of New Hampshire. The se-
quenced csrA genes from these gacAsup mutant suppres-
sors were compared to that of csrA from the published
genome of V. fischeri [47] in order to identify the location
of the mutation. Probable siblings were identified by deter-
mining if two mutants that harbored an identical mutation
were isolated from the same overnight seed culture used
to select for suppression; only one such mutant was iden-
tified, and removed from further characterization. For the
two suppressors that did not harbor mutations in the csrA
gene, the csrB1 and csrB2 genes were amplified with gene
specific primers: RsmB1F and RsmB1R for csrB1, and
RsmB2F and RsmB2R for csrB2 (Table 3).
Identification of the ihfAS2 mutation
Genomic DNA was extracted from ES114, and VCW2E2
late log cultures grown in LBS using the Wizard
Genomic DNA Purification Kit and supplied manufac-
turer protocol (Promega, WI, USA). The DNA quality
was assessed visually by electrophoresis. Sequencing
libraries were generated from 1 μg of genomic DNA as
determined using the Qubit 2.0 fluorimeter (LifeTech,
CA, US). DNA was sheared on the Covaris M220 Ulta-
sonicator to a mean size of 500 bp. Libraries were gener-
ated using the TruSeq Kit and targeted size selection of
500 bp was completed using the optional gel-extraction
method in the TruSeq protocol (Illumina). Genomes
were sequenced by a high output mode run 101 bp
paired-end reads using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 at the
Hubbard Center for Genome Studies at the University of
New Hampshire. The Illumina reads were aligned to the
published reference ES114 strain (PRJNA58163, assem-
bly GCA_000011805.1) using Breseq pipeline [48]. The
predicted mutations (Additional file 1) were cross-
referenced with ~60 ES114 (VCW1C6) derivatives also
re-sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2500 101 bp paired-
end reads, which revealed differences from the published
ES114 reference genome (Additional file 1). Each identi-
fied mutant allele was compared to orthologous loci in
various Vibrio species using BLAST [49] and the nucleo-
tide nr database, which indicated in each instance that
the genomic variation in VCW1C6 represented wild-
type and likely ancestral, not mutant alleles suggesting
they represent errors from the original ES114 genome
assembly. For all remaining variant loci identified in
VCW2E2 not present in ES114 (VCW1C6) oligonucleo-
tide
primers
were
designed
flanking
the
mutation
(Additional file 1) and Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Poly-
merase (Life Technologies) used to amplify regions by
PCR in both VCW2E2 and its parental strain VCW2A1
using an initial denaturation of 1 min at 94 °C, followed
by 30 cycles of denaturation of 1 min 94 °C, annealing at
described temperature (Table 3) for 1 min, followed by
elongation for 1 min at 68 °C. The amplicons were se-
quenced by the Sanger method [50] using both forward
and reverse primers at the Hubbard Center for Genome
Studies at the University of New Hampshire. The se-
quencing reads were aligned with ES114 (BioProject
PRJNA58163, assembly GCA_000011805.1) using Seq-
Man Pro (DNASTAR, Inc. Madison, WI) which allowed
confirmation that the single nucleotide polymorphism
C > G at base pair position 178 in ihfA as the suppressor
mutation in VCW2E2 (BioProject PRJNA283549). All
other sequences in VCW2E2 were identical to the

reference, and were not considered as potential suppres-
sor mutations.
Semi-quantitative assessment of csrA transcripts
For one suppressor whose promoter was presumably de-
leted, and which exhibited a strong suppressor pheno-
type, we determined whether the csrA transcript was
indeed produced by semi-quantitative PCR using the
rpoB transcript as a housekeeping control gene. Primers
amplifying rpoB (QRpoBF1 and QRpoBR2) and csrA
(QCsrAF1, and QCsrAR2) were designed to produce
amplicons ~100 bp in length (Table 3). Total RNA was
extracted from two biological replicates of late-log cul-
tures of ES114, VCW2A1 (gacA::TnKm), and VCW9A1
(gacA::TnKmsup(ihfAS2 csrAE)) grown in SWT. Cells were
pelleted and suspended in half the volume of RNA pro-
tect (Ambion) and held overnight at 4 °C. RNA was ex-
tracted using the UltraClean Microbial RNA Isolation
Kit (MoBio Laboratories) followed by DNase treatment
with the RTS-DNase kit (MoBio Laboratories). Absence
of contaminating DNA was confirmed by end-point
PCR using 1 μl of template. The RNA quantity and pur-
ity
was
determined
spectrophotometrically
using
a
NanoDrop 2000, and the quality and integrity of RNA
assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. cDNA was syn-
thesized from 500 ng of total RNA using the qScript™
Flex cDNA Synthesis Kit (Quanta Biosciences, MD, US)
using 0.5 μM each gene-specific reverse primer and 5 %
final volume qScript Reverse Transcriptase at 42 °C for
1 h following the manufacturers protocols. The resulting
cDNA was diluted 1/5 with nuclease free water, and im-
mediately used for assays. Assays were performed on
1 μl of cDNA template, in triplicate in 10 μl reactions
using using AccuStart PCR Supermix (Quanta Biosci-
ences, MD, US) in separate reactions for csrA and rpoB
cycled at the same time for 30 cycles with a 1 min de-
naturation at of 94 °C, a 1 min annealing at 57 °C, and a
30 s elongation at of 72 °C. Two replicate RT reactions
for each biological replicate RNA were performed. The
production of amplicons was assessed at 10, 15, 20, 25,
and 30 cycles by electrophoresis of 5 μl of PCR reaction
and the presence of amplicons of the correct size visual-
ized after separation with 1.2 % agarose gel electrophor-
esis in 1x TAE and 1x Gel Red (Phenix Research).
Amplicons for rpoB were produced from all strains by
20–25 cycles, and from csrA between 20 and 30 cycles.
Phenotypic analysis
All phenotypic analyses were conducted as outlined
previously [10]. Briefly, luminescence and growth was
determined from cultures grown at 28 °C with shaking
(200 RPM) in SWT. Luminescence and density (OD600)
were measured from 1 ml of culture using a lumin-
ometer (Turner Designs) and a spectrophotometer
(Eppendorf). LPS was observed as difference in colony
opacity on LBS plates. Growth on simple sugars was
assessed as cell density in minimal medium supple-
mented with 32.6 mM glycerol or with 32.6 mM gly-
cerol and 0.5 % casamino acids as a control. Growth
yield OD600 was measured from cultures grown in
SWT overnight (18 h) at 28 °C. The experiments con-
tained 3 replicates and were repeated at least 2 times.
Data shown is from a representative experiment and
error is expresses as SE. Siderophore production was
measured using a modified liquid chrome azurol S
(CAS) liquid assay [51]. Briefly, Cultures were grown in
minimal medium based on that used for CAS agar
plates [30], and grown for eight hours with shaking.
The density (OD600) was measured and cells removed
by pelleting. Equal volumes of the culture supernatant
and a CAS assay solution were mixed along with 1 % of
shuttle solution (0.2 M 5-Sulfosalicylic acid). After
20 min the absorbance at 630 nm of these mixtures was
measured using a plate reader (Tecan). Siderophore is
reported percent siderophore units (compared to the
blank control) per OD600.
Squid colonization was performed exactly as out-
lined previously [10, 15]. Luminescence was deter-
mined with a luminometer (Turner Designs) and
colonization by homogenization and plating of squid
first frozen at −80 °C at 12, 24 and 48 h after hatch-
ing [10, 15]. Luminescence of strains in light organs
is
reported
relative
to
the
average
lum/CFU
of
ES114 colonized squid.
