Abstract
The fruit fly Drosophila is a classic model organism to study adaptation as well as the relationship between genetic variation
and phenotypes. Although associated bacterial communities might be important for many aspects of Drosophila biology,
knowledge about their diversity, composition, and factors shaping them is limited. We used 454-based sequencing of a
variable region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene to characterize the bacterial communities associated with wild and
laboratory Drosophila isolates. In order to specifically investigate effects of food source and host species on bacterial
communities, we analyzed samples from wild Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans collected from a variety of natural
substrates, as well as from adults and larvae of nine laboratory-reared Drosophila species. We find no evidence for host
species effects in lab-reared flies; instead, lab of origin and stochastic effects, which could influence studies of Drosophila
phenotypes, are pronounced. In contrast, the natural Drosophila–associated microbiota appears to be predominantly
shaped by food substrate with an additional but smaller effect of host species identity. We identify a core member of this
natural microbiota that belongs to the genus Gluconobacter and is common to all wild-caught flies in this study, but absent
from the laboratory. This makes it a strong candidate for being part of what could be a natural D. melanogaster and D.
simulans core microbiome. Furthermore, we were able to identify candidate pathogens in natural fly isolates.

Introduction
Bacterial symbionts play important roles for metazoans covering
the whole spectrum from beneficial mutualists to infectious,
disease-causing
pathogens.
Benefits
that
hosts
derive
from
mutualists are diverse and include extracting essential nutrients
from food in humans [1], breaking down cellulose in Ruminantia
[2], and light production by Vibrio fisheri in the light organs of the
bobtail squid [3]. In arthropods, indigenous bacteria protect
aphids from parasitoid wasps [4], protect beewolf larvae from
infectious disease [5], and keep leaf tissue of fallen leaves
photosynthetically active, providing larvae of leaf-miner moths
with nutrients [6]. Detrimental effects microbes have on their hosts
range from lethal disease [7] to changing the sex ratio of the
offspring in their favor [8].
Pathogens as well as mutualists not only interact with their
hosts, but at the same time with other members of the often diverse
host associated microbial community [9]. Indirect evidence for
competition for ecological niches in the host comes from Staubach
et al. [10] who found that the lack of the glycosyltransferase
B4galnt2 in mice leads to the replacement of bacterial taxa by
closely related taxa. Bakula [11] showed that Escherichia coli persists
in Drosophila only when monoxenic and is quickly replaced by
other bacteria upon exposure suggesting that there is competition
between bacteria to colonize the fly. Ryu et al. [12] demonstrated
that suppressing the caudal gene by RNAi in Drosophila leads to
replacement of an Acetobacter species by a Gluconobacter species
followed by strong pathological consequences. These examples
indicate that there is interaction and competition for ecological
niches along the continuum of hosts and microbes. Thus, a
thorough understanding of host-microbe interactions also requires
comprehensive knowledge of host associated bacterial communi-
ties and the factors shaping them.
These factors can roughly be grouped into two categories. The
first category includes biotic and abiotic environmental factors the
host and its associated microbes are exposed to (e.g. diet). The
second category includes factors that are determined by host
genetics. The relative importance of these factors in shaping
human associated microbial communities is a matter of recent
debate [13,14]. One approach to disentangle these effects is by
studying the relationship of host genetic divergence, diet, and
divergence of microbial communities. A correlation of genetic
divergence between a set of host taxa and the divergence of their
associated microbial communities would suggest that genetic
effects play a role in shaping these communities. On the other
hand, a correlation of microbial community composition with diet
would suggest an effect of environmental factors. This approach
has been applied to a variety of mammals [15–17], but it has
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org
1
August 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 8 | e70749
proven difficult in mammals to control for diet and other
environmental factors across host taxa. Hence, it is not yet clear,
which factors are the strongest determinants of microbiota
composition.
In contrast to the complex microbial communities associated
with mammals like humans and mice, which are estimated to
consist of hundreds or even thousands of taxa [10,18], some
studies suggest that only a handful of bacterial species dominate
the microbial communities of invertebrates [19,20]. This has
turned a spotlight on Drosophila to serve as a simpler model for
understanding the complex interactions of hosts and their
associated microbes [20–22]. The Drosophila immune system is
reasonably well understood [23] and the tractability of Drosophila
has helped to identify genes involved in specific interactions
between host and microbes. This includes genes underlying
avoidance behavior towards harmful bacteria [24] and immune
defense [25] as well as interactions with commensals [26] and
beneficial bacteria that prevent pathogens from colonizing the host
[12] or promote its growth [27,28].
As a first step in understanding the diversity of bacterial
communities associated with Drosophila it is important to investi-
gate flies under natural conditions. Most studies conducted to date
focused on more specific interactions or those found in the lab
[20,29], while few studies described the natural diversity of fly
associated bacterial communities. Cox and Gilmore [30] included
natural fly isolates and combined culture and culture-independent
methods to characterize fly associated microbial communities.
Corby-Harris et al. [31] focused their study on the diversity of
microbial communities along latitudinal clines. Chandler et al. [32]
conducted the most comprehensive analysis of bacteria associated
with Drosophila by sampling a range of drosophilid flies from their
natural food substrates. However, these studies were limited by
either throughput or dependence on cultivation [33]. Although
Chandler et al. [32] sampled flies from different natural substrates,
their sampling scheme did not allow to directly disentangle host
species and diet effects on the natural microbiota because this
requires replicated, pairwise sampling of at least two host species
from the identical substrate.
In order to understand bacterial communities associated with
Drosophila and the factors shaping their diversity, we investigated
the relative effects of food substrate and fly species. Accordingly,
we analyzed D. melanogaster and D. simulans collected in pairs from
different natural food sources, as well as under controlled lab
conditions. Furthermore, we assessed the communities of nine lab-
reared Drosophila species and their larvae to evaluate the influence
of host genetic background on a broad scale. These species were
selected to span the Drosophila genus and match the 12 species
sequenced by Clark et al. [34] (D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D.
sechellia, D. yakuba, D. erecta, D. pseudoobscura, D. persimilis, D. virilis, D.
mojavensis).
Results
In order to profile Drosophila-associated bacterial communities,
we amplified and sequenced ,300 bp (base pairs) of the 16S
rRNA gene (see Materials and Methods) spanning the variable
regions V1 and V2. Three types of fly isolates were used in our
study. The samples are listed in Table 1. First, species-pairs of
wild-caught D. melanogaster and D. simulans samples were collected
from different substrates (oranges, strawberries, apples, peaches,
compost) at multiple locations on the East and West Coast of the
USA. Within each sample pair, D. melanogaster and D. simulans
individuals were collected at the same location, time, and substrate
(mostly by aspiration of individual flies from the same fruit),
thereby controlling for environmental variables to the extent
possible in the field. This allowed us to study the effects of both,
substrate and host species on the composition of bacterial
communities independently of each other. Second, we included
isofemale, wild-derived strains of D. melanogaster and D. simulans
that were reared in the Petrov lab for ,3 years after collection.
Third, a variety of Drosophila species from the UCSD Stock Center
was chosen to complement the analysis. We primarily focused on
adults, but also studied bacterial communities in larvae of the lab-
reared strains. We analyzed a total of ,340,000 sequences that
matched our quality criteria (see Materials and Methods).
,130,000 sequences matched the Wolbachia 16S rRNA gene
and were excluded from the analysis. For Petrov lab D. simulans
sample 6, removal of Wolbachia sequences led to a very low number
of remaining sequences (18 sequences). Therefore, we excluded
this sample from further analysis (Table S1 lists the total number of
sequences and the proportion of Wolbachia sequences for each
sample).
Diversity of bacterial communities associated with
Drosophila
For assessing the Drosophila associated bacterial diversity in
general, we grouped all sequences into 97% identity operational
taxonomic units (OTUs) and calculated inverted Simpson diversity
indices [35]. Rarefaction curves are plotted in Figure 1. Bacterial
communities associated with lab-reared flies are strikingly less
diverse than those of wild-caught flies (P = 2.961025, Wilcoxon
test on Simpson diversity index), indicating a bias towards a few
dominant species in the lab compared to more complex and
species-rich communities of wild-caught flies. However, substantial
variance of community diversity was found between individual
samples from lab-reared flies. While bacterial diversity in 14 out of
20 lab-reared fly samples is lower than in all wild-caught samples,
the diversity of lab-reared D. erecta, D. persimilis, D. sechellia, D. virilis,
and Petrov lab D. melanogaster sample 3 (m.pet3 in Table 1) lies
within the range of wild-caught samples. The diversity observed in
Petrov lab D. melanogaster sample 6 (m.pet6) is even higher than in
wild-caught flies and its community composition appears to differ
from the other Petrov lab samples (Figure 2C). Because this sample
was unusual, we conducted all of the subsequent analyses with and
without this sample, but did not notice any qualitative differences
(data not shown). All of the analyses described below that include
lab-reared samples also include this sample.
Comparing estimates of species richness and diversity from our
study to estimates from lab-reared flies in Wong et al. [20] supports
the notion that bacterial communities of lab-reared flies are less
species rich (Table 2). Our species richness estimates from wild-
caught flies are more than twice as high on average (43 vs 19,
P,0.001) if we exclude all OTUs that contain fewer than 10
sequences from our data as in Wong et al. [20]. Bacterial diversity,
as measured by Shannon’s diversity index, is also significantly
higher in wild-caught flies (P,0.01) from this study. We also
compared the bacterial community diversity in this study to that
observed in previous studies of wild-caught Drosophila bacterial
communities, namely Corby-Harris et al. [31], Cox and Gilmore
[30], and Chandler et al. [32]. A comparison of diversity indices
among studies is provided in Table 2. Estimated species-richness is
more than seven times higher in our study compared to all other
studies (P,0.001, Student’s T-test). However, limiting our data
artificially to 100 sequences per sample, which is well within the
range of the sequencing depth of the above studies, results in an
average Chao’s richness estimate of 22 species. This is not
significantly different from the richness estimates of the other
studies on wild-caught flies, implying that different sequencing

depths are responsible for the different species richness estimates.
When we limit our sample size to 100 sequences to make our study
more comparable to the clone library data from Cox and Gilmore
[30] and Chandler et al. [32] we find values for Shannon’s diversity
index that are similar and even a bit higher (P,0.001, Student’s
T-test) in these two studies. Note that direct comparison of
diversity between studies is difficult due to different sample
preparations (whole flies, fly guts, washing procedure), sequencing
depths, and different regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene that
were used for the analysis (see Table 2).
Bacterial community composition
In order to examine which bacterial taxa are associated with
Drosophila, we classified the 16S rRNA gene sequences by aligning
them to the SILVA reference database [36] using MOTHUR
[37]. The results are summarized in Figure 2. Our results show
that, on the family level, the combined communities are
dominated by Acetobacteraceae (55.3%) and Lactobacillaceae
(31.7%) (Figure 2A). Leuconostocaceae (3.8%), Enterobacteriace-
ae (3.3%) and Enterococcaceae (1.9%) are less abundant. All five
of these families are known to be associated with Drosophila [6,32]
including certain Drosophila pathogenic Enterococcus strains. The
remaining sequences (,3.9%) are low abundance families mainly
belonging to the Proteobacteria.
In addition to the differences in overall diversity described
above, different bacterial genera dominate the communities of lab-

reared and wild-caught flies (Figure 2B). The dominant genera
also vary sharply between flies from the Petrov lab and the UCSD
Stock Center. Specifically, communities associated with wild-
caught flies are dominated by Gluconobacter (39.3% average relative
abundance), Acetobacter (25.5%), and an enteric bacteria cluster
(10.4%) that is mainly comprised of Pectobacterium (4.8% of total
average relative abundance), Serratia (3.5%), Erwinia (1.3%), and
Brenneria (0.5%). In contrast, Gluconobacter and the enteric bacteria
cluster are virtually absent from our lab-reared flies (,0.001 and
,0.1%). Acetobacter is extremely common in UCSD Stock Center

lab-reared flies (72.7%), but comprises only 1.2% of the bacterial
communities in flies from the Petrov lab. On the other hand,
Lactobacillus contributes a substantial fraction of sequences in lab-
reared flies (60.4% in Petrov lab, 19.1% UCSD Stock Center)
while playing only a minor role in wild-caught flies (0.5%). In
addition, Leuconostoc is common in the Petrov lab (28.0%) but rare
(1%) in wild-caught flies and the UCSD Stock Center (,1%).
Inspection of individual samples revealed that the relative
abundance of Leuconostoc is highly variable across D. melanogaster
and D. simulans. In Petrov lab flies, relative abundance ranges from
87.6% and 84.5% in samples m.pet1 and s.pet1, respectively, to
being
undetectable

m.pet4,
m.pet5,

(Figure 2C).
In addition to differences in broad patterns of community
composition, we also detected two wild-caught samples dominated
by genera that are rare overall: 80.3% of all sequences in the D.
melanogaster sample m.ora1 collected from oranges were classified as
Enterococcus (80.3%), while the sample m.str collected from
strawberries has a high prevalence of Providencia (26.3%). The
relative abundance of Enterococcus is smaller than 0.5% in all other
wild-caught samples. Providencia was detected in only three other
samples at a relative abundance smaller than or equal to 1%.
Intriguingly, 92% (1165 sequences) of all Providencia sequences
from sample m.str are identical, suggesting the presence of a single,
high-frequency Providencia strain in m.str. The highly prevalent
sequence from sample m.str is 100% identical to the sequence of P.
alcalifaciens from Juneja and Lazzaro [38], while it differs from all
other Providencia sequences in [38] by at least two positions
(Figure 3A). P. alcalifaciens was shown to be highly virulent in D.
melanogaster [7] causing the highest mortality amongst all strains
tested and reaching cell counts of up to 106 colony forming units
per fly.
By grouping all sequences into 97% identity OTUs we sought to
obtain a more detailed picture of bacterial community composi-
tion. Figure 3B depicts the relative abundance of the ten most
abundant OTUs across all samples. A single OTU classified as
Gluconobacter is common among all wild-caught flies (34.7%
average relative abundance, OTU 25), but completely absent
from lab-reared flies. Even in the wild-caught fly sample m.ora1
that is dominated by an Enterococcus OTU (OTU 60) this
Gluconobacter OTU represents 8.9% of all non-Enterococcus sequenc-
es. Because this OTU is common in all wild-caught flies, and
specific to wild-caught flies, it is a strong candidate for being a
member of a D. melanogaster and D. simulans core microbiome in
nature. Three Acetobacter OTUs are also common in wild-caught
flies (OTUs 26, 23, and 29). However, these OTUs are rare in flies
collected from oranges and OTU 26 is also prevalent in lab-reared
flies from the UCSD Stock Center. In lab-reared flies, especially
flies from the Petrov lab, three Lactobacillus OTUs are common
(OTU 28, 22, and 35). The abundance of these OTUs is highly
variable between samples, with one dominant OTU (OTU 28)
that is common in most Petrov lab samples, while the other two
OTUs are at high frequency in the larval samples mpet1_l (OTU
22) and m.pet6_l (OTU 35). The second most common Acetobacter
OTU (OTU 38) is common only in the UCSD Stock Center
samples and larval sample s.pet3_l. In UCSD samples, this OTU
is strongly negatively correlated with OTU 26 (P = 2.961025,
r2 = 0.64), which was also classified as Acetobacter.
The composition of bacterial communities associated
with flies differ between laboratories and the wild

variation in bacterial communities between lab-reared and wild-
caught flies, we carried out a Principal Coordinate Analysis

distances.
Jaccard
distances
compare the number of OTUs that are shared between two
communities to the total number in both communities, with a
smaller proportion of shared OTUs leading to an increased
Jaccard distance. Jaccard distance analysis requires that the same
number of sequences is used in each sample. This is because
samples that contain more sequences are more likely to include
low frequency OTUs that can appear private to that sample and
inflate Jaccard distances. We therefore in silico capped the number
of sequence reads per sample to a common number by
subsampling. In order to test for potential stochastic effects of
subsampling on our results, we analyzed 1000 bootstraps of the
subsampling for all PCoAs presented.
Figure 4A shows the position of all samples analyzed in this
study relative to the first two PCos. PCo1 explains 16.1% of the
variation and separates wild-caught, Petrov lab, and UCSD Stock

flies (P,2610216 and r2 = 0.87, ANOVA, 100% of bootstraps
P,9.3610213). These results suggest that Petrov lab, UCSD Stock
Center, and wild-caught flies all have their own distinct bacterial
communities.
Similarity between larval and adult samples from the same
laboratory further underscores the importance of the origin of the
flies (Petrov lab, UCSD Stock Center) for the composition of their
associated microbiota. The only exception is Petrov lab D. simulans
larval sample 3 (s.pet3_l), which grouped closer to the UCSD
samples in Figure 4A and has a more UCSD-like community
dominated by Acetobacter (Figure 2C).
Communities of wild-caught flies differ by substrate and
between D. melanogaster and D. simulans
We analyzed paired samples of wild-caught D. melanogaster and
D. simulans isolated from five different natural substrates (oranges,
apples, peaches, strawberries, and compost) in order to elucidate
the influence of substrate on fly-associated bacterial communities
in the wild. Figure 4B shows a PCoA including only wild-caught D.
melanogaster and D. simulans samples. Communities of flies collected
from oranges at three different sampling locations are clearly
separated from the remaining samples by PCo1 (P = 0.00017,

pile and those from the flies collected from the fruit substrates
(P,0.001, r2 = 0.61, ANOVA, 98.1% of bootstraps P,0.05),
indicating that food substrate or a variable correlated with food
substrate is an important factor shaping fly-associated bacterial
communities. Interestingly, communities of flies from strawberries,
apples, and peaches are relatively similar irrespective of sampling
location. Flies from strawberries were collected from a sampling
location on the West coast of the US while flies from apples and
peaches were collected on the East Coast of the US.
While the first two PCos in the PCoA of wild-caught flies
(Figure 4B) reflect differences related to food substrate, PCo3,
PCo4, and PCo5 reveal a more subtle, but significant difference
between the communities associated with the two fly species. In
78% of all subsampling bootstraps, we found a significant
difference (ANOVA P,0.05) between D. melanogaster and D.
simulans associated microbial communities along these PCos
(Figure S1). This represents a significant enrichment of low
p-values (P,4.96102149, Chi-squared test). An example from
these bootstraps, in which PCo3 differentiates between D.
melanogaster and D. simulans, is given in Figure 4C (P = 0.0011,
r2 = 0.60, ANOVA). We do not detect such a difference between
lab-reared D. melanogaster and D. simulans (data not shown).
Discussion
In this study we focused primarily on understanding the factors
that shape Drosophila-associated bacterial communities, with an
emphasis on the relative roles of environmental and host species
effects. In order to disentangle environmental from host species
effects, we collected and compared sample pairs of D. melanogaster
and D. simulans from the same natural substrates. We extended this
approach by analyzing these two species under controlled
laboratory conditions. Finally, in order to generalize our results,
we also analyzed a set of host species spanning the Drosophila
phylogeny. A correlation between genetic distance of different fly
species and the dissimilarity of their bacterial communities under
controlled
conditions
would
be
an
indication
that
genetic
differences between host species could play a role in shaping fly
bacterial communities. Therefore, we extracted bacterial DNA
from whole flies by carrying out extensive tissue homogenization.
The bacterial load on the fly surface is known to be ,10 times
lower than the interior load [29]. Therefore, the influence of
external bacteria on the total community composition is expected
to be rather minor. Additionally, our focus on the total bacteria
associated with the whole fly, and not only the intestinal tract, was
motivated by the belief that bacteria associated with fly surfaces
might play important roles in shaping the fly environment. This is
supported by Ren et al. [29] who found acetic acid bacteria
accumulating in bristled areas on the fly surface, likely forming
biofilms and by Barata et al. [33] who demonstrated that damaged
grapes
do
not
acquire
acetic
acid
bacteria
when
insects,
particularly Drosophila, are physically excluded. These acetic acid
bacteria could very well be transported on the fly surface. Note
that even though we aspirated flies from individual fruit and
attempted to associate bacterial communities with the substrate,
we likely sampled bacterial communities that the fly has acquired
during its life span. This includes bacteria from the particular fruit
from which it was sampled, but could also include bacteria
potentially from prior locations.

Factors shaping natural fly associated communities
We determined that substrate or a strongly correlated variable is
the most important factor shaping bacterial communities in wild-
caught flies. Diet has been previously suggested as a major
determinant of bacterial community composition in mammals
[14,15,39] and flies [32] and our results agree with these findings.
The most distinct bacterial communities were associated with flies
collected from oranges. Oranges contain citric acid and might
have a lower pH than other substrates. Furthermore, orange peel
contains essential oils that have bactericidal properties that might
influence the bacterial community composition [40]. Although the
substrate appears to be a plausible factor shaping the communities
here, we cannot disentangle its effects from seasonal effects (e.g.
temperature, humidity). This is because we collected flies from
different substrates at different times of the year when the
respective fruit were ripe.
We carefully sampled D. melanogaster and D. simulans across
different sites and substrates in nature which allowed us to
disentangle environmental effects from host species effects on
microbial community composition. We found evidence that host
fly species identity (D. melanogaster vs. D. simulans) detectably
influences the associated microbial communities, but that the effect
is subtle. Although our power comparing lab-reared D. melanogaster
and D. simulans might be lower because of smaller sample size and
restriction to fewer sequences, mainly due to high Wolbachia
prevalence in some lab-reared samples, it is intriguing that this
host species effect is detectable only in the wild and could not be
detected
in
lab-reared
flies.
Moreover,
while
we
detected
differences between two closely related sister species in the wild,
we could not detect any differences for nine substantially more
divergent Drosophila species in the lab. We found no correspon-
dence of distances between bacterial communities and genetic
distances between nine lab-reared fly species (Table S2), unlike
Ochman et al. [16] and Ley et al. [15], who found this correlation
in primates and other mammals. Taken together these findings
imply that the effects of host species on microbial communities are
rather subtle in drosophilids and/or need natural environmental
conditions to manifest themselves.
The observed difference between D. melanogaster and D. simulans
microbial communities might be caused by a variety of host-
associated factors, such as arrival times at fruit [41,42], age
distributions in the wild (Emily Behrman and Paul Schmidt,
University of Pennsylvania, personal communication), or host
genetic differences [12,25,43].
Composition of bacterial communities in the lab and in
the wild
PCoA revealed that, in concordance with earlier studies [30,32],
bacterial communities associated with Drosophila differ sharply
between different laboratories and between laboratories and the
wild. Interestingly, bacteria from different genera, but with similar
metabolic properties, dominate the communities of wild-caught,
Petrov lab, and UCSD Stock Center flies. Gluconobacter species are
the most prevalent bacteria in wild-caught flies in our study. This
is in accordance with Corby-Harris et al. [31], who also find
abundant Gluconobacter sequences in wild-caught flies, but different
from Chandler et al. [32] who find a smaller fraction of
Gluconobacter sequences. More than 90% of all Gluconobacter
sequences in our study can be grouped into a single OTU that
is common in all wild-caught flies. In contrast, Gluconobacter is
almost absent from the lab strains. Thus, this OTU is a strong
candidate for being a major member of a core microbiome that is
shared among and specific to wild-caught D. melanogaster and D.
simulans. Gluconobacter belongs to the same family (Acetobacter-
aceae) as Acetobacter, which is also common in wild-caught flies with
the exception of flies from oranges that carry less Acetobacter.
Acetobacter is also the most prevalent genus in flies from the UCSD
Stock Center and has very similar metabolic capabilities. Both
genera, Gluconobacter and Acetobacter, oxidize sugars and alcohol to
acetic acid, and tolerate low pH as well as high ethanol
concentrations [44]. Acetic acid bacteria have been reported to
occur in association with many insect species and a role as
important symbionts has been postulated by Crotti et al. [45].
Lactobacillus which is at high prevalence in Petrov lab flies, tolerates
low pH and high ethanol concentrations as well, but instead
oxidize sugars to lactic acid [46]. The high prevalence of bacteria
with similar metabolic capabilities, tolerance of low pH, and high
ethanol concentrations strongly suggests that there is environmen-
tal selection for these bacterial groups. Rotting fruit, the most
important natural substrate for D. melanogaster and D. simulans in
our study, contain high amounts of sugar and are known to be
colonized by a variety of ethanol producing yeasts [47]. Yeasts can
produce
high alcohol
concentrations,
thereby generating
a
nutrient rich environment for acetic acid or lactic acid producing
bacteria (Acetobacteraceae and Lactobacillaceae), while inhibiting
the growth of those less tolerant to alcohol. The production of
these acids selects for acid tolerant microorganisms including the
microorganisms that produced the acids in the first place. This
suggests that environmental selection [48] is an important factor
for the observed prevalence of these bacteria.
Interestingly bacteria of the genus Lactobacillus, which have been
associated with effects on Drosophila growth [28] and even
assortative mating [49], are prevalent only in the lab in our study.
Sixty percent of all sequences from Petrov lab flies, and 19% of all
sequences obtained from UCSD Stock Center flies are Lactobacillus.
In most wild-caught samples Lactobacillus represented less than 1%
of all sequences. This finding is corroborated by results from
Chandler et al. [32], who find an increase of the proportion of
Lactobacillus species in lab-reared flies. Thus, while studying the
effects of Lactobacillus on drosophilids in the laboratory is useful as a
general model for insect-microbe interactions, its relevance to
Drosophila in nature may be limited.
In contrast to Chandler et al. [32], who found that Enterobac-
teriaceae from group Orbus are highly prevalent in Drosophila,
these bacteria are absent or at very low frequency in our samples
(not amongst the best BLAST hits for any of the 100 most
abundant OTUs in our data set). Although two lower abundant
OTUs (OTU 49 and OTU 221) have Orbus sequences among the
top 50 BLAST hits, the sequences from [32] are not amongst these
hits. We can only speculate about the reasons for this difference
here. One possibility might be an epidemic of Orbus group
bacteria in 2007 and 2008, when Chandler et al. [32] collected
their samples.
Given the strong effect of food substrates that we observed in
wild Drosophila, similar effects might play a role in lab-reared flies.
Differences in the provided food substrates between laboratories
might therefore lead to differences in communities. For example,
we provide our flies with a corn meal molasses diet, whereas the
Stock Center uses sugar instead of molasses. In addition, our food
contains Tegosept(r) to reduce microbial growth, while this
ingredient is only optional at UCSD. Intriguingly, Chandler et
al. [32] found that fly-associated bacterial communities differed
between labs at UC Davis despite using the same food from the
same kitchen, suggesting that other factors are involved as well.
Candidate explanations would involve ecological drift, which is
likely to be stronger in the laboratory, and priority effects
[42,50,51]. A potential role of stochastic drift processes and
priority effects is supported by the notion that the occurrence of
Drosophila Associated Bacteria

the two major Acetobacter OTUs (OTU 26 and 38) in the UCSD
Stock Center flies is strongly antagonistic. This is in accordance
with a model in which one of the OTUs quickly occupies an
ecological niche and excludes its ecologically similar, close relative.
Bacterial communities of lab-reared flies are highly variable in
diversity and composition within and between laboratories in this
study.
Because
fly
phenotypes
are
influenced
by
bacteria
[27,28,52], this bacterial variation can add to the variance of
phenotypic traits. This makes it more difficult to detect genetic
variation underlying phenotypic traits and reduces reproducibility
between laboratories. The presence of a certain microbiota might
also lead to unwanted results in genetic trait mapping: Genetic
variation that is attributed to directly underlie a phenotypic trait
might indeed interact with microbes that influence this trait
instead, thus influencing the trait only indirectly. Monitoring of
microbial communities during experiments in which phenotypes
are measured could be a means to approach these difficulties.
Species richness of lab-reared and wild-caught
Drosophila associated bacterial communities
Although diversity varies strongly across different samples from
lab-reared flies, their bacterial communities are on average less
diverse than those of wild-caught flies. This has been reported
previously [30,32,53].
The three most plausible explanations for this pattern in our
study are: (i) laboratory fly food is highly homogeneous and
contains antimicrobial preservatives, proprionic acid and Tego-
sept(r) in our case, which inhibit bacterial growth and likely reduce
bacterial diversity, (ii) the transfer of flies to vials with fresh food
during stock keeping could lead to ecological drift [50], which
reduces diversity in the long run due to potential loss of taxa, (iii)
while there is a constant influx of new bacteria into natural fly
habitats, e.g. from other insects or via aerial transport, this influx is
limited by cotton-sealed vials used in Drosophila husbandry.
It is known that species richness is often overestimated using
pyrosequencing approaches (e.g. [54]). We applied rigorous
quality filtering and Chimera detection (see Materials and
Methods) and used an OTU threshold of 97% identity which is
thought to be robust against sequencing and PCR errors [54].
Although we take all these measures, we can not exclude that we
are still overestimating the diversity in our samples. On the other
hand overly stringent removal of sequences might make us miss
important aspects of microbial communities [55].
Potential fly pathogens
The bacterial communities of certain wild-caught fly isolates
contained potential Drosophila pathogens at high frequencies. In
one sample of D. melanogaster from strawberries, more than 25% of
all sequences were identical to those of P. alcalifaciens whereas
Providencia is absent or at very low frequency in all other samples.
This bacterium is known to be highly virulent in fruit flies [7], but
reaches high bacterial loads in flies usually only when flies are
systemically infected (personal communication, Brian Lazzaro,
Cornell University). Enterococcus was present at high abundance in
one D. melanogaster orange sample 1 (m.ora1, 80.3%), but virtually
absent from all other samples. Enterococcus species were previously
found to be associated with D. melanogaster [32] and are highly
prevalent in the lab-reared flies studied by Cox and Gilmore [30].
These authors showed that Enterococcus can reach densities of 105
colony forming units per fly, causing severe disease symptoms and
high mortality. This compares to a total of ,104 colony forming
units including all bacterial species in healthy flies [29,30].
The presence of these disease-associated genera in individual
samples, and their absence or near absence from other samples
suggests that one or more flies were systemically infected in the
samples that showed a high relative abundance of the disease
associated genus. Thus, detection of infections with potential
pathogens in natural fly populations seems possible by bacterial
16S rRNA gene sequencing. Hence, 16S rRNA sequencing could
be a powerful means for the epidemiological monitoring of
bacterial pathogens.
Conclusion
We show that under natural conditions the bacterial commu-
nities associated with Drosophila correlate mainly with the substrate
the flies have been collected from and to a smaller extent with fly
species. Despite appreciable effort, we did not find evidence for
host
species
effects
on
the
bacterial
communities
under
controlled laboratory conditions. Instead, laboratory of origin
and stochastic effects on microbial communities are pronounced
in the laboratory. This suggests that host genetic effects, as
represented by genetic differences between the fly species in this
study, might be rather small or absent in the lab, while there is
potential for such effects under natural conditions. Furthermore,
we find that acetic acid producing bacteria (Acetobacteracea)
are ubiquitous symbionts of Drosophila in nature. Intriguingly, it
has been shown both that D. melanogaster promotes dispersal and
establishment of these bacteria [33] and that the presence of
acetic acid bacteria can have beneficial effects on D. melanogaster
larval growth and development time [27]. Together these
findings suggest that D. melanogaster and its siblings transport and
establish the acetic acid bacteria on the substrates, which might
modify these substrates in ways beneficial to the flies and their
offspring. We speculate that the microbial community associat-
ed with Drosophila can be seen as an external organ of the fly
holobiont [56] in a similar way that the human gut flora has
been referred to as the ‘‘forgotten organ’’ [57].
Materials and Methods
Fly samples
D. sechellia (4021 0248.27), D. erecta (14021 0224.00), D. yakuba
(14021 0261.01), D. persimilis (14011-0111.49), D. pseudoobsura
(14011-0121.148), D. mojavensis (15081-1351.30) and D. virilis
(15010-1051.00) were obtained from the UCSD Stock Center as
well as one additional D. melanogaster (14021-0231.131) and one D.
simulans (14021-0251.250) strain. The UCSD Stock Center strain
ID numbers are in parentheses.
Petrov lab D. melanogaster and D. simulans were originally
collected in Portland, OR and San Diego, CA in 2008 and lab-
reared on standard molasses corn meal diet for ,3 years (27 g
Agar, 75 g corn meal, 200 ml molasses, 42 g dry active yeast,
40 ml Tegosept, 15 ml propionic acid, in 2.8 l deionized water).
Note that the food is boiled for 20 minutes killing most of the
microbes in the food and that Tegosept is added after cooling
down to prevent excessive microbial growth. We used flies from six
independently acquired isofemale lines from each fly species
(m.pet1–6 and s.pet 1–6). All lines were kept under the same
conditions and on the same food, but in independent vials. DNA
extractions and library preparations were performed indepen-
dently for each line.
All adult lab-reared flies were transferred to fresh Petrov lab
food vials 24 hours prior to DNA extraction. Petrov lab flies were
taken from culture vials in the Petrov lab and placed on fresh food
24 hours prior extraction. UCSD Stock Center flies were taken
from the vials we received from the Stock Center and placed on
fresh Petrov lab food 24 hours prior extraction.

Wild D. melanogaster and D. simulans from rotting apples, peaches,
and a compost pile were collected in an orchard on the East coast
of the USA (Johnston, RI) in August 2010. Flies from oranges were
collected from three locations in the Central Valley of California
USA: at a location close to Brentwood, at a site East of Manteca,
and a site in Escalon in February and March 2011. Flies from
strawberries were collected close to Waterford, CA in May 2011.
All sampling sites were at least 10 km apart from each other. In
most cases pairs of D. melanogaster and D. simulans were picked from
the same individual fruit. Otherwise, flies were selected from the
same type of fruit in close proximity. Flies were transported to the
lab alive, in empty vials. On hot days, flies were slightly chilled
using ice or car A/C. All flies were brought back to the lab within
5 hours of collection. Males of D. melanogaster and D. simulans were
identified by genital morphology and stored at 280uC until DNA
extraction. Flies from Johnston, RI were shipped on dry ice to the
Petrov lab for DNA extraction.
For the collection of larval samples from lab-reared flies, adult
flies were transferred to fresh Petrov lab food vials for two days and
then removed from the vial again. Vials containing eggs were kept
at room temperature until larvae started to crawl out of the food
for pupation. Larvae leaving the food and larvae of the same size
that were still in the food were regarded third instar larvae and
collected for DNA extraction. Excess food was removed from the
larvae by transferring them to a microcentrifuge tube containing
500 ml PBS (pH 7.4), vortexing for 3 seconds, and then discarding
the liquid. The larval samples correspond to the adult flies i.e. the
sample named m.pet1_l was collected from the same isofemale line
as m.pet1 using the procedure described above.
DNA Extraction and PCR
DNA was extracted from pools of five males, with the exception
of D. simulans orange sample 1 (s.ora1) and D. melanogaster orange
sample 3 (m.ora3), for both of which we were able to retrieve three
males only. Larval samples included three third instar larvae per
sample. DNA extraction was performed using the Qiagen
QIAamp DNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Carlsbad, CA) following
the manufacturer’s protocol with the following modifications:
Flies/larvae were incubated in buffer ATL containing proteinase
K at 56uC for 30 min to soften and predigest the exoskeleton.
Digestion was then interrupted by 3 minutes of bead beating on a
BioSpec Mini Bead Beater 96 with glass beads 0.1 mm, 0.5 mm,
and 1 mm in size (BioSpec, Bartlesville, OK), followed by another
30 min of incubation at 56uC. After addition of lysis buffer AL
samples were incubated 30 min at 70uC and 10 min at 95uC. The
remaining extraction procedure was performed according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Extraction controls were run in parallel
with all samples to monitor contamination. Broad range primers
(27F and 338R) were fused to identification tags and the 454
sequencing primers to amplify a fragment spanning the variable
regions V1 and V2 of the bacterial ribosomal 16S rRNA
gene. The primer sequences are (59-CTATGCGCCTTGC-
CAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-39)
and reverse (59-CGTATCGCCTCCCTCGCGCCATCAGXX-
XXXXXXXXCATGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT-39). The Xs
are a placeholder for identification tags (Multiplex Identifiers,
MIDs); a different tag was used for each amplification reaction.
Primers 27F and 338R are underlined. DNA was amplified using
PhusionH Hot Start DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland)
and the following cycling conditions: 30 sec at 98uC; 35 cycles of
9 sec at 98uC, 30 sec at 55uC, and 30 sec at 72uC; final extension
for 10 min at 72uC). In order to reduce PCR bias, amplification
reactions were performed in duplicate and pooled. In order to
reduce the number of Wolbachia amplicons, PCR products were
restriction digested with 2 ml FastDigestH BstZ17 (Fermentas,
Glen Burnie, MD) at 37uC for 30 min. BstZ17 was selected to
specifically cut Wolbachia sequences close to the middle of the
amplified region. Reaction products were run on an agarose gel,
extracted using the Qiagen MinElute Gel Extraction Kit, and
quantified with the Quant-iTTM dsDNA BR Assay Kit on a
NanoDrop 3300 Fluorometer. Equimolar amounts of purified
PCR product from each sample were pooled and further
purified using Ampure Beads (Agencourt). The pool was run on
an Agilent Bioanalyzer prior to emulsion PCR for final
quantification. Resulting PCR products were run on a 454
sequencer using Titanium Chemistry. A set of samples was
extracted using a FastPrep FP120 bead beater (Qbiogene,
Carlsbad, CA). These samples include D. erecta, D. yakuba, D.
sechellia from the UCSD Stock Center, and wild-caught samples
collected in Johnston, RI. These samples were sequenced twice,
with and without the BstZ17 digest. Relative abundance of
bacterial taxa correlated strongly between the two procedures
for these samples after removal of Wolbachia reads (mean
r2 = 0.94). Therefore, we pooled the sequencing reads obtained
with and without the digest to get a higher sequencing depth per
sample.
Amplicons from samples with a high Wolbachia load were often
so effectively digested that the final DNA yield was too small for
library preparation. In order to have enough PCR-product for
library construction, we shortened digestion time for amplicons
from these samples to 5 minutes, resulting in an incomplete digest.
Predictably, these samples yielded a high percentage of Wolbachia
sequences after the incomplete digest.
We verified the specificity of the BstZ17 for cutting Wolbachia
sequences by an in silico search for restriction sites in our
sequences from undigested samples, all sequences from Chan-
dler et al. [32], and all bacterial sequences in the SILVA data
base. A very small fraction of non-Wolbachia sequences would
have been cut in our sequence set from undigested samples (27
out of 23423) and the data from Chandler et al. [32] (18 out of
3243, mainly confined to a single sample). The majority of these
sequences were classified as Rhizobiales. In silico search for the
BstZ17 restriction site in sequences from the SILVA database
revealed that the sequences that would have been cut by the
restriction enzyme fall mainly into the orders of Rhizobiales,
Myxococcales, and a non-Wolbachia Rickettsiales. Although
these orders have either not been reported to be associated
with Drosophila or occur only at very low numbers, the
pretreatment with BstZ17 of most of our samples might have
led to underestimation of their abundance in this study.
Data analysis
The MOTHUR v1.23.1 [37] software was used for analysis.
We used the trim.seqs command to remove primer and MID
tags and quality filter our sequences according to the following
requirements: Minimum average quality of 35 in each 50 bp
window, minimum length of 260 bp, homopolymers no longer
than 8 bp. Only sequences matching the MIDs and the bacterial
primers perfectly were kept. Passing sequences were filtered for
sequencing errors using the pre.cluster command. Sequences
were then screened for chimeras using UCHIME [58] as
implemented in MOTHUR with standard settings separately for
each sample. 2% of all sequences were identified as chimeric
and discarded. The remaining sequences were aligned to the
SILVA reference database [36] using the MOTHUR imple-
mented kmer algorithm with standard settings. Sequences not
aligning in the expected region were removed using the
screen.seqs command. Sequences were classified into bacterial

taxa with the classify.seqs command using the SILVA reference
database
and
taxonomy
with
default
settings.
Sequences
classified as Wolbachia were removed from further analysis.
Grouping
of
sequences
into
OTUs
was
done
using
the
MOTHUR implemented average neighbor algorithm. Inverted
Simpson and Shannon diversity indices were generated with the
collect.single command. Rarefaction sampling was performed
with the rarefaction.single command. The sequence with the
smallest distance to all other sequences in each OTU was picked
with the get.oturep command using the weighted option and
classified with the classify.otu command using the SILVA
reference database and taxonomy. Representative sequences of
the 100 most common OTUs were also searched in the nr/nt
database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(ncbi) using megablast with default settings via the web server
(http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Taxonomy information from
the BLAST results was compared to the classification using the
SILVA database. PCoA of Jaccard distances was performed
applying the pcoa command on a Jaccard distance matrix
generated with the dist.shared command. Because Jaccard
distance is based on presence and absence of OTUs, it is
sensitive to information from low abundance OTUs, even in the
presence of other more abundant OTUs. In an abundance-
based distance measure this information would likely be
swamped by few extremely common OTUs. These consider-
ations are particularly relevant to our study where a handful of
bacterial families dominate the data (Figure 2A). Jaccard
distances are also less prone to be affected by biased abundance
measurements that can result from amplification biases during
PCR amplification of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. The
downside
of
the
sensitivity
of
Jaccard
distances
to
low
abundance OTUs is that samples with a higher number of
bacterial sequence reads can be biased towards detecting more
low abundance OTUs which inflates Jaccard distance. There-
fore the number of sequences per sample was in silico capped to
have the same
number of sequences per sample
before
calculation of Jaccard distances. The caps were 912 sequences
per sample for the PCoA of wild-caught flies and 116 sequences
per sample for the PCoA including all samples.

simulans based on PCoA of Jaccard distances. If there
was no species effect on microbial community composition, p-
values are expected to be uniformly distributed. PCos 1–9 are
displayed. Axes 3, 4, and 5 are enriched for low p-values indicating
a species effect.

Table S2
Non-significance of a correlation between
bacterial community distances and genetic distances
for the nine lab-reared Drosophila species obtained
from the UCSD Stock Center. The genetic distances between
the nine Drosophila species were calculated genome wide using 4-
fold degenerate sites. We tested for correlation of the genetic
distances with different community distance measures at different
OTU identity cutoffs. P-values based on Pearson’s correlation
coefficient and Spearman’s rho are shown.

representative sequence for each OTU, SILVA based taxonomy,
and the relative abundance for of each OTU in individual samples
(columns with sample names).
