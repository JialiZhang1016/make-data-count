ABSTRACT
Objective: Performing an in vitro evaluation of the biological effects on cell growth and viability of fibroblasts in PLGA membranes 
with and without simvastatin. Methods: Two groups of resorbable synthetic polymeric membranes were used: PLGA, with and 
without simvastatin, cut into a suitable format to fit to 24 thermometric wells. Fibroblasts were grown on resorbable membranes 
and evaluated for proliferation and viability at 24, 48 and 72 hours after the beginning of cultivation, being the tests performed in 
triplicate. For the cell growth analysis, the Trypan blue exclusion method was applied, while cell viability was observed by the MTT test. 
The results were statistically analyzed applying the Two-Way ANOVA, followed by the Bonferroni test, with 95% confidence interval 
and P value smaller than 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. Results: Statistical difference (p <0.01) was seen between the 
control group (2.16x104 ± 0.51 cells) and the PLGA group with simvastatin (1.58x104 ± 0.36 cells) in the 48-hour period. After 72 hours, 
statistical differences (p <0.001) were observed between the PLGA group with simvastatin (1.66x104 ± 0.49 cells) and the PLGA group 
without simvastatin (2.25x104 ± 0.2 cells) when compared to the control group (2.81x104 ± 0.33 cells) for cell proliferation. Statistical 
differences (p <0.05) were observed between the control group (0.27 ± 0.05) and the PLGA group with simvastatin (0.21 ± 0.03). 
Likewise, a statistical difference (p <0.001) was seen between the PLGA group without simvastatin (0.19 ± 0.02) and the control group 
after 24 hours. In the 48 – 72-hour period, statistical differences (p <0.001) were observed between the control group (0.36 ± 0.09 and 
0.55 ± 0.05, after 48 and 72 hours respectively) and the PLGA group without simvastatin (0.26 ± 0.05 and 0.34 ± 0.07, after 48 and 72 
hours respectively), as well as in the PLGA group with simvastatin (0.27 ± 0.04 and 0.31 ± 0, 04, after 48 and 72 hours respectively) for 
the cell viability test. Conclusion: The association of simvastatin to PLGA membranes had an inhibitory effect on fibroblast proliferation, 
as well as induced a reduction in cell viability. Thus, the use of PLGA along with simvastatin may assist in guided bone regeneration.

INTRODUCTION
Contemporary Implantology has a great need 
to predict results and present less traumatic surgical 
techniques for reconstruction and regeneration of tissues 
lost by pathological, physiological or traumatic processes. 
Currently, guided bone regeneration (GBR) and guided 
tissue regeneration (GTR) techniques are frequently applied, 
with the biological principle of creating a reserved space 
that facilitates selective cell proliferation and binding. The 
membranes act as a physical barrier with the purpose of 
creating spaces, preventing the proliferation of connective 
and epithelial tissues in bone and/or periodontal defects, 
stimulating bone and tissue regeneration [1,2].
In dental practice, the GBR and the GTR concepts 
have been applied since the late 1980’s [3]. Although 
different materials have been investigated for such 
procedures, resorbable membranes, based on animal 
collagen and synthetic polymers, are the materials most 
widely used [4].
Poly (1-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid), PLGA, is 
a synthetic copolymer of poly lactic acid (PLA) and 
polyglycolic acid (PGA) that has been used in the 
production of several therapeutic devices including tissue 
grafting, surgical suture wires and drug carrier membranes 
[5,6]. It is important to mention that its characteristics 
are excellent biocompatibility, controlled biodegradability, 
adjustable degradation rates, mechanical properties, 
thermal processability and drug controlled release [7]. 
The PLGA polymers’ biodegradable characteristics and 
biocompatibility, along with handling easiness, have made 
them an excellent choice for the development of resorbable 
membranes used in GBR and GTR [8].
The use of PLGA membranes, such as drug carriers, 
has created new perspectives for bone regeneration, with 
statins being the most promising drug group. Statins 
(among them, simvastatin) are irreversible and competitive 
inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl Coenzyme A 
(HMG-CoA) reductase that initially acts by displacing the 
natural substrate (HMG-CoA) in the cholesterol biosynthetic 
pathway, reducing the biosynthesis of mevalonate 
and, consequently, the cholesterol. Recent studies have 
reported that these drugs have several pleiotropic effects 
that induce an improvement in the regeneration of bone 
tissue, since they may change the mechanisms of bone 
formation and resorption [9,10]. However, the correct 
molecular mechanism of increased bone formation 
remains unknown. Nevertheless, there are in vitro and 
in vivo studies reporting that the stimulation of vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and bone morphogenetic 
proteins 2 (BMP-2) are responsible for the anabolic effects 
of statins in bone metabolism [11,12].
Therefore, this study aimed at performing an in 
vitro evaluation of the biological effects of cell growth 
and viability in PLGA membranes with and without 
simvastatin.
L-lactic acid-CO-glycolic acid: an in vitro study

RGO, Rev Gaúch Odontol. 2019;67:e20190024
METHODS
The survey was conducted at the São Leopoldo 
Mandic Dental School and Research Center, campus 
Campinas, Brazil, in the Cell and Molecular Biology 
Laboratory, after being approved by the Research Ethics 
Committee of the São Leopoldo Mandic Dental School and 
Research Center (Protocol 2015/0393).
Sample
Two groups of resorbable synthetic polymeric 
membranes were used: PLGA with simvastatin and PLGA 
without simvastatin. The membranes were produced 
from the PLGA Copolymer (Lactic Acid-Co-Glycolic Acid 
(RESOMER™ Evonik, USA) by the solvent evaporation 
method. These Aliphatic Esters have the property of being 
hydrolyzed and degraded by the Krebs cycle, resulting 
in Carbonic Gas and Water as metabolic products. The 
degradation time and, hence, absorption is related to the 
total mass of the membrane. On average, this period may 
take 90 to 120 days.
PLGA copolymer, in the ratio 3:1 (based polymer 
lactide: poly (L-Lactic acid-co-trimethylene carbonate), 
was dissolved in PA chloroform (10% w/v), at room 
temperature. After the complete dissolution of the 
polymer, particles of sucrose (75% w/w) with granulation 
of less than 500 μm were added. This solution was poured 
into Medical Grade Silicone molds with dimensions of 2 x 
8 x 200 mm until the total evaporation of the solvent. The 
membranes were, then, sectioned with a scalpel blade to 
obtain square samples with 2 mm thickness and sides with 
8 mm. Sucrose was removed using 1% polyvinyl alcohol 
solution PS ((C 2 H 4 O) n) in 24-hour baths, followed by 
24-hour baths with distilled water under constant stirring. 
For the samples containing simvastatin (SIM ≥ 97%, high 
performance liquid chromatography grade, HPLC, solid 
M = 418.57), the drug was diluted 5% in chloroform (10 ml) 
to which sucrose (75%) was added to the polymer already 
diluted in chloroform. The additional steps for obtaining the 
membrane with Simvastatin were the same as described 
above. After the samples’ drying, they were sterilized by 
gamma radiation (20kGy) (CBE EMBRARRAD, Cotia-SP, 
Brazil)
The membranes were cut into a suitable format 
to fit in the 24 thermometric well plates, so that the 
proliferation and cell viability tests could be performed 
respectively.
Cell lines
The human fibroblast cell lines were obtained 
from the Cell Bank of the Cell Culture Laboratory, being 
provided by (São Leopoldo Mandic Institute and Research 
Center, Campinas). These cells were previously isolated by 
the primary culture of human gingival cells removed from 
volunteer patients by the explant technique.
Cell culture
Fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified 
Eagle medium (DMEM, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, 
MO, USA), adding 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (Cultilab Ltda., 
Campinas/SP) and 1% antibiotic solution - antimycotic 
(Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA), kept at 37°C 
temperature, humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.
To maintain the cell viability, all procedures were 
performed in a laminar flow hood for the sterility of 
the materials and substances used for cell culture. The 
monitoring of cell growth was performed every 24 hours, 
using inverted phase microscope, and the culture medium 
was changed at 2 and 3 days. After reaching confluency, 
the cells were plated at 110 cells/mm 2 density in 24 well 
plates for cell proliferation and viability evaluation. As a 
controlling method, the cells were plated in polystyrene 
not containing the material studied. 
Cell count
For the proliferation evaluation, the cells were 
counted at 24, 48 and 72 hour after culturing the 
membranes studied. Then, two groups were used with 
resorbable synthetic membranes: PLGA with simvastatin 
and PLGA without simvastatin. The medium was removed 
from the plate and the cells were washed with PBS 
(phosphate buffer solution), pH 7.0. Then, the cells were 
enzymatically removed from the plate with 500μL Trypsin 
at 37°C for 5 minutes. 10μL of cell suspension were, then, 
removed and mixed with 10μL of Tripan blue (for cytotoxicity 
assessment) and, 10μL were placed in a hemocytometer 
(Neubauer Chamber, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) 
and taken to inverted microscope (Nikon, Eclipse TS100) 
for counting and observation of the cell growth curvature.
The total number of cells was obtained by the 
following equation:

All the experiments were done in triplicates (3 
wells for each membrane and control cells).
Cytotoxicity evaluation (MTT)
Cell cultures were tested for cell viability using the 
3- [4,5-Dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl) -2,5-diphenyl-tetrazole (MTT) 
assay. This assay evaluates the capability of metabolically 
active cells to reduce MTT by converting the tetrazolium 
yellow salts to purple formazan crystals and, therefore, the 
ability of the viable cells to cleave the tetrazole ring present 
in MTT by the action of enzymes dehydrogenases present 
in the active mitochondria, forming formazan crystals. In 
the cytotoxicity assay, 110 cells/mm2 were used in 24 well 
plates, incubated for a period of 24, 48 and 72 hour at 
37°C. Then, 540μL of DMEM culture medium and 60μL 
of the MTT solution (5mg / mL - Sigma, USA) were added 
under the membranes and control, being incubated for 
3 hours at 37°C. After the total incubation period, the 
solution was removed and 600μL of 10% DMSO (dimethyl 
sulfoxide) solution was added.
After the crystals solubilization, the quantification 
was performed on a ELX800 microplate reader (Epoch 
Biotek Instruments, Inc) at 590 nm, obtaining the absorbance 
measurements.
Statistical analysis
Results were expressed as mean ± E.P.M. (n = 6). 
Statistical analysis between the groups was performed 
applying the Two-way (ANOVA), followed by the Bonferroni 
test, with a 95% confidence interval, being p <0.05 accepted 
as statistically significant.
RESULTS
Considering the cell proliferation test, evaluating 
the average number of cells obtained in the groups, it was 
seen that the control group showed higher cell proliferation 
(p <0.001) than the PLGA experimental group with 
simvastatin, after 48 hours, and the PLGA group without 
simvastatin, after 72 hours. On average of the three lines, 
it was observed that the PLGA with simvastatin and the 
Total Number of Cells=
  (Number of squares used for counting)
(Number of cells counted x Initial Volume x Dilution x 104)
PLGA without simvastatin presented similar results. At 24 
hours, despite the higher cell proliferation in the control 
group (1.68x104 ± 0.36 cells), there was no statistical 
difference between the PLGA group without simvastatin 
(1.46x104 ± 0.44 cells) and the PLGA group with 
simvastatin (1.40x104 ± 0.72 cells). At 48 hours, statistical 
difference (p <0.01) was observed between the control 
group (2.16x104 ± 0.51 cells) and the PLGA group with 
simvastatin (1.58x104 ± 0.36 cells). Statistical differences 
(p <0.001) were also observed after 72 hours between the 
PLGA group with simvastatin (1.66x104 ± 0.49 cells) and 
the PLGA group without simvastatin (2.25x104 ± 0.2 cells) 
compared to the group control (2.81x104 ± 0.33 cells). 
Therefore, PLGA membranes with simvastatin showed less 
cellular proliferation over time, when compared to PLGA 
membranes without simvastatin and the control group. 
The data are shown in figure 1.
DISCUSSION
Bone defects are a challenge to Dentistry, 
especially in rehabilitation specialties, such as Implantology.

The success of treatments depends on the quantity and 
quality of bone availability. Thus, grafting, for bone tissue 
gain, arose as an alternative to overcome such difficulty. 
It is important to mention that, uncontrolled resorption, 
especially of the autogenous graft, requires more effective 
materials for bone regeneration [13].
Resorbable and non-resorbable membranes are 
widely used in clinical practice to assist in the regeneration 
process of soft and hard tissues, being a viable alternative 
for the correction of tissue defects. However, the 
membranes should present some characteristics to be 
effective such as biocompatibility, physical and mechanical 
properties favoring its placement in human beings, good 
resistance and proper degradation medium not causing 
tissue neoformation [14]. Among the several membranes 
available in the market, the PLGA membrane stands 
out as a polymer with high structural strength and 
biocompatibility, as well as showing a great potential as a 
drug carrier [15].
In the present study, it was observed that the 
use of PLGA membranes was able to reduce fibroblast 
proliferation over a period of 72 hours, indicating that such 
membrane may reduce the formation of fibrous tissue, 
corroborating with the findings of Shen et al. [16], who 
demonstrated that PLGA membranes treated with carbon 
dioxide (CO2) plasma were effective in inhibiting fibroblast 
growth factors [16]. In addition to the inhibitory effect 
on the cell proliferation of fibroblasts, the present work 
showed that the PLGA membrane induces a decrease of 
fibroblast viability.
Several drugs are used as auxiliaries to tissue and 
bone regeneration, such as the simvastatin. In the literature, 
several studies have reported evidences on the efficacy 
of this statin to bone regeneration [17,18]. In our study, 
the tests performed showed that PLGA membranes with 
simvastatin were more effective in inhibiting fibroblasts, 
decreasing the viability of the remaining fibroblasts at all 
times. Wu et al. [19] concluded that the local application 
of simvastatin through a PLGA membrane promoted bone 
neoformation in rat alveolus after exodontics, suggesting 
the relation of this result to the osteoinductive and 
antiresorptive properties of simvastatin.
In view of the results found in here, it can 
be suggested the association of simvastatin to PLGA 
membranes in GBR. Nath et al. [20] have demonstrated 
that PLGA microspheres can be used as simvastatin 
carriers for bone regeneration, being an effective system 
for the regeneration of bone tissue. The literature shows 
that, when working with PLGA nanoparticles as drug 
carriers, there is a linear relationship between the polymer 
concentration and the nanoparticle volume with different 
solvents [21].
Aiming at making the association of simvastatin 
to PLGA membranes more effective, it is necessary to 
emphasize the importance of drug release just on the 
surface that will be in contact with the bone tissue, 
reducing the formation of fibrous tissue in the bone 
defect and stimulating the osteogenic neoformation 
(figure 3). This can be achieved due to the easiness of 
working with PLGA as a carrier of several types of drugs 
and at different scales (nanoparticles, microparticles 
and membranes) [15].

CONCLUSION
Based on the experimental protocols adopted, 
it is suggested that simvastatin can be successfully 
incorporated to PLGA membranes for drug delivery at 
the surgical site, having the ability to inhibit fibroblast 
proliferation and reduce the viability of such cells. The 
inhibitory effect of proliferation and reduction of PLGA cell 
viability was enhanced after the addition of simvastatin to 
the membrane, in which the effects were evaluated up to 
72 hours.
