Abstract. The formation of a river of smoke crossing southern Africa was investigated during the Aerosols,
Radiation and Clouds in southern Africa (AEROCLO-sA) campaign in September 2017. A complementary set
of global and mesoscale numerical simulations as well as ground-based, airborne and space-borne observations
of the dynamics, thermodynamics and composition of the atmosphere are used to characterize the river of smoke
in terms of timing and vertical extent of the biomass burning aerosol (BBA) layer.
The study area was under the synoptic inﬂuence of a coastal low rooted in a tropical easterly wave and a
high-pressure system over the continent and westerly waves at mid latitudes, one of which had an embedded
cut-off low (CoL). The coastal low interacted with the second of two approaching westerly waves and ultimately
formed a mid-level tropical temperate trough (TTT). The TTT created the fast-moving air mass transported to
the southwestern Indian Ocean as a river of smoke. The CoL, which developed and intensiﬁed in the upper levels
associated with the ﬁrst (easternmost) westerly wave, remained stationary above northern Namibia prior to the
formation of the TTT and was responsible for the thickening of the BBA layer.
This shows that the evolution of the river of smoke is very much tied to the evolution of the TTT, while
its vertical extent is related to the presence of the CoL. The mechanisms by which the CoL, observed over
Namibia in the entrance region of the river of smoke, inﬂuences the vertical structure of the BBA layer is mainly
associated with the ascending motion above the BBA layer. In the presence of the CoL, the top of the BBA layer
over northern Namibia reaches altitudes above 8 km. This is much higher than the average height of the top of the
BBA layer over the regions where the smoke comes from (Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique), which is
5 to 6 km.
The results suggest that the interaction between the TTTs and the CoLs which form during the winter may
have a role in promoting the transport of BBA from ﬁre-prone regions in the tropical band to the temperate mid
latitudes and the southwestern Indian Ocean.

Introduction
Widespread, coherent bands of smoke from forest ﬁres are
regularly observed to cross the southern African subconti-
nent near the end of southern Africa’s dry season, and par-
ticularly in September (Annegarn et al., 2002; McMillan et
al., 2003; Swap et al., 2003). These features are generally re-
ferred to as “rivers of smoke” (owing to the sharply deﬁned
boundaries of the smoke plume, giving them the appearance
of a “river”) and can be several hundred kilometers wide
and extend over a few thousands of kilometers while ﬂowing
off the southeastern coast of Africa. The smoke transported
in these rivers comes from thousands of agricultural ﬁres
as well as accidental forest ﬁres burning in Angola, Zam-
bia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, the Democratic Republic of
Congo, and South Africa, favored by dry conditions during
the austral winter (see Fig. 1 in Roberts et al., 2009). The
smoke from the southern African subcontinent is generally
contained in multiple stratiﬁed layers trapped below approx-
imately 850, 700, and 500 hPa, depending on synoptic con-
ditions (Stein et al., 2003). The river-of-smoke events gener-
ally correspond to the direct eastward transport of biomass
burning aerosols (BBAs) from southern Africa to the south-
western Indian Ocean in ﬁve main transport paths classiﬁed
by Garstang et al. (1996). These trajectories lead to the trans-
port of massive amounts of aerosols and gases (e.g., carbon
monoxide) towards the southwestern Indian Ocean (Duﬂot
et al., 2010) and as far as southeastern Australia (Pak et al.,
2003; Sinha et al., 2004), with potential important implica-
tions for the radiative budget and the marine productivity of
the region (Luo et al., 2008).
The aerosol properties, transport and distribution across
southern Africa, the South Atlantic and the Indian Ocean
have been widely investigated for their key role in control-
ling the radiative budget in the region and, consequently,
global climate dynamics (Zuidema et al., 2016a, b; Haywood
et al., 2021; Redemann et al., 2021). Recently, the long-term
aerosol transport in the region was characterized in terms of
synoptic weather patterns (Gaetani et al., 2021). Neverthe-
less, to date, the rivers of smoke have exclusively been stud-
ied in the framework of the 2000 Southern African Regional
Science Initiative (SAFARI 2000) using ground-based, air-
borne and space-borne observations (Annegarn et al., 2002;
Jury and Freiman, 2002; Swap et al., 2003; McMillan et al.,
2003; Stein et al., 2003; Schmid et al., 2003; Pak et al.,
2003; Magi et al., 2003) as well as numerical simulations
(Sinha et al., 2004). Among other studies, Stein et al. (2003)
showed that they form in regions where high-pressure and
low-pressure synoptic-scale systems are juxtaposed to con-
strain the shape of the aerosol rivers.
Rivers of smoke are very effective at transporting large
amounts of smoke from the ﬁre-prone tropical regions into
the mid-latitude westerly circulation (Annegarn et al., 2002).
Surface synoptic conditions in the tropical zone are generally
dominated by easterly waves and associated lows, whereas
aloft a more stable anticyclonic circulation prevails in associ-
ation with the continental high-pressure system. The subtrop-
ical latitudes are dominated by continental highs and baro-
clinic westerly waves at all levels (Jury and Freiman, 2002).
Hence, the transport of smoke from tropical Africa to the
southwestern Indian Ocean implies the formation of com-
plex synoptic systems that can bridge two climatic regions,
namely the tropical band (10–20◦S) and the temperate sub-
tropical band (20–30◦S) over the southern African subconti-
nent.
Tropical temperate troughs (TTTs) typically form when a
tropical disturbance in the lower atmosphere is coupled with
a mid-latitude trough in the upper atmosphere (Lyons, 1991).
Mid-latitude baroclinic waves are a necessary condition for
TTT development (Macron et al., 2014). TTTs are known
to be the dominant rainfall-producing weather system over
southern Africa during the austral summer, when they form
a cloud band that extends along the northwest–southeast di-
rection across the landmass and the adjacent southwestern In-
dian Ocean (Ratna et al., 2013; Howard et al., 2019, and ref-
erences therein) and tend to propagate eastward. TTT events
have been suggested to act as a major mechanism of pole-
ward transfer of moisture owing to the strong convergence
forming a pronounced poleward ﬂux along the cloud band
(Ratna et al., 2013). However, the role of TTTs in the trans-
port of BBA during the late winter has never been investi-
gated until now.
During the AEROCLO-sA (AErosol, RadiatiOn and
CLOuds in southern Africa) ﬁeld campaign held in Namibia
in August–September 2017 (Formenti et al., 2019), a river of
smoke was observed to sweep through southern Africa from
west to east between 5 and 6 September 2017. The study area
was under the synoptic inﬂuence of a coastal low rooted in a
tropical easterly wave, a high-pressure system over the con-
tinent and westerly waves at the mid latitudes, one of which
had an embedded cut-off low (CoL; Favre et al., 2012). Dur-
ing this period, the coastal low interacted with the second
of two approaching westerly waves and ultimately formed
a mid-level TTT, which created the fast-moving limb of air
transported to the southwestern Indian Ocean as a river of
smoke. The CoL, which developed and intensiﬁed in the
upper levels associated with the ﬁrst (easternmost) of the
two approaching westerly waves, remained stationary above
northern Namibia prior to the formation of the TTT (from
2 to 4 September 2017) and was responsible for the thicken-
ing of the BBA layer that subsequently was conveyed south-
eastward. The objective of the paper is to assess the respec-
tive impact of both the CoL and the TTT on the atmospheric
circulation and composition in the mid and lower troposphere
over southern Africa prior to and during the river of smoke
event.
In Sect. 2 we present the model simulations and measure-
ments used in the study. In Sect. 3, we detail the life cycle
of the CoL and the TTT over western Namibia, while their
impact on the formation of the river of smoke event over

southern Africa is analyzed in Sect. 4. We also detail the
vertical distribution and origin of smoke in the lower tropo-
sphere over northern Namibia, in the entrance region of the
river of smoke, using airborne measurements made on 5 and
6 September. In Sect. 5, the impact of the CoL and the TTT
on the tropospheric composition over the subcontinent is in-
vestigated. Finally, we summarize and conclude in Sect. 6.

Data
2.1
Modeling
2.1.1
ECMWF reanalysis products: ERA5 and CAMS
The regional circulation over continental southern Africa and
adjacent oceans for the period 1–6 September 2017 is an-
alyzed using the Fifth European Centre for Medium-Range
Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis (ERA5, Hersbach
et al., 2018). The reanalysis outputs are available every hour
on a 0.25◦× 0.25◦grid as well as 137 pressure levels, 88 of
which are below 20 km and 60 below 5 km (note that only
37 levels are available for download). Among the available
variables, we focus on mean sea level pressure (MSLP),
geopotential height (Z), potential vorticity (PV), outgoing
longwave radiation (OLR), vertical velocity (ω) and wind.
We also make use of the Copernicus Atmospheric Moni-
toring Service (CAMS; Inness et al., 2019) reanalysis avail-
able every 3 h (00:00, 03:00, 06:00, 09:00, 12:00, 15:00,
18:00 and 21:00 UTC) with a resolution of approximately
80 km and 60 pressure levels (37 of which are below 20 km
and 20 below 5 km) to analyze the evolution of BBA during
the episode of interest (note that only 25 levels are available
for download). For consistency with ERA5 data, CAMS data
have been interpolated onto a 0.25◦regular grid. In the fol-
lowing, we use organic matter as a proxy for BBA. In addi-
tion, we have compared with the same dynamical and ther-
modynamic variables as for ERA5 in order to check the con-
sistency between the two types of products. This is essential
as we intend to investigate the relationship between the at-
mospheric dynamics and the distribution of BBA. It turns out
that ﬁelds such as PV, ω, wind and relative humidity are very
consistent between ERA5 and CAMS (not shown).
The evolution of the BBA transport and the associated at-
mospheric circulation from 1 to 6 September 2017 above
Namibia is analyzed by using a principal component analy-
sis (PCA) of organic matter aerosol optical thickness (AOT)
at 550 nm and MSLP and Z at 700 and 300 hPa from the
CAMS reanalysis product. PCA consists in projecting data
variability onto an orthogonal basis by solving the eigen-
value problem of the data covariance matrix, so that data vari-
ability is decomposed into independent variability modes,
each explaining a fraction of the total variability (von Storch
and Zwiers, 1999). Each variability mode is presented as
an empirical orthogonal function (EOF), accounting for the
anomaly pattern of the variable related to the mean of the an-
alyzed period and the associated PC time series accounting
for the evolution of the anomaly amplitude. It follows that
negative values indicate a reversal of the anomaly pattern.
2.1.2
Meso-NH
A high-resolution simulation of the atmospheric dynamics,
thermodynamics, and composition for the case study was
also run with the non-hydrostatic mesoscale model Meso-
NH (Lac et al., 2018), version 5.4, over a domain covering
southern Africa. Running the model at a relatively ﬁne reso-
lution allows a comparison with high spatiotemporal resolu-
tion airborne observations at a commensurate scale as well as
to have a better description of the topography in the area and
its inﬂuence on aerosol transport. The model was run on a
grid with 5 km horizontal spacing and 64 levels (14 of them
in the lower 1 km and 30 in the lower 6 km) with a resolu-
tion of 60 m close to the surface to 600 m above 7 km. It was
run for 6 d starting from 00:00 UTC on 1 September 2017.
The lateral boundary conditions were given by ECMWF op-
erational analysis. The simulation used the Surface Exter-
nalisée (SURFEX) scheme for surface ﬂuxes (Masson et al.,
2013), a 1.5th-order closure scheme for turbulence (Cuxart et
al., 2000), an eddy-diffusivity mass-ﬂux scheme for shallow
convection (Pergaud et al., 2009), a microphysical scheme
for mixed-phase clouds (Pinty and Jabouille, 1998), a statis-
tical scheme for subgrid cloud cover (Chaboureau and Bech-
told, 2002), the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model (Mlawer et
al., 1997) for longwave radiation, and the two-stream scheme
(Fouquart and Bonnel, 1986) for shortwave radiation. Wind
is advected using a fourth-order centered scheme coupled
to an explicit fourth-order centered Runge–Kutta time split-
ting (Lunet et al., 2017), and the other variables are ad-
vected with the piece-wise parabolic method (PPM) advec-
tion scheme (Colella and Woodward, 1984), a scheme with
excellent mass-conservation properties and low numerical
diffusion (Müller, 1992).
Emission, transport and deposition of dust were parame-
terized using a prognostic scheme (Grini et al., 2006) to al-
low online interaction with radiation. In the simulations, a
biomass burning (BB) carbon passive tracer (accounting for
both black carbon and organic carbon) is used as a proxy for
smoke. The BB tracer is emitted in the ﬁrst layer of the model
based on the daily Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED)
version 4, available at a horizontal resolution of 0.25◦×0.25◦
(van der Werf et al., 2017). The BB tracer is then mixed verti-
cally by turbulence in the atmospheric boundary layer. Fires
in the area of interest are not intense enough to inject BBA
above the atmospheric boundary layer, as discussed in sev-
eral studies (e.g., Labonne et al., 2017; Menut et al., 2018;
Mallet et al., 2020). No initial conditions are assumed for
BBA, so that BB trace concentrations build up with time in
the simulation domain. In source regions, BB tracers will ﬁll
the lower 6 km of the troposphere in about 12 h, i.e., approx-
imately the time for the atmospheric boundary layer to de-

velop during the day. Therefore, the assessment of the BBA
simulation is meaningful only after a spinup period that we
estimate at 12 h. Backward trajectories were computed us-
ing three passive tracers initialized with the 3D coordinates
of each grid cell at their initial location (Gheusi and Stein,
2002). A mass extinction efﬁciency of 5.05 m2 g−1 (repre-
sentative of aged smoke as in Mallet et al., 2019) was used
to compute AOT at 550 nm from BB carbon concentration
simulated by Meso-NH.
2.2
Observations
2.2.1
Ground-based observations
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Aerosol
Robotic Network (NASA AERONET) operates a number of
Sun spectral photometers in Namibia and South Africa, pro-
viding long-term and continuous monitoring of aerosol opti-
cal, microphysical, and radiative properties. We use level-2.0
(cloud-screened and quality-assured) AOT at 500 nm data.
AERONET stations of interest are located in Windpoort, Bo-
nanza, the HESS (High Energy Stereoscopic System) site,
Henties Bay (Namibia), as well as Upington (South Africa)
(see Fig. 1).
2.2.2
Airborne observations
For the period from 5 to 12 September 2017, dynamics
and thermodynamics proﬁles over continental Namibia were
obtained from dropsondes released from a high-ﬂying air-
craft, the French Falcon 20 aircraft for environmental re-
search of Saﬁre (Service des Avions Français Instrumen-
tés pour la Recherche en Environnement) based in Walvis
Bay, on the western coast of Namibia (see Fig. 1). The ver-
tical structure of the aerosol layers was obtained from the
nadir-pointing airborne lidar LEANDRE Nouvelle Généra-
tion (LNG; Bruneau et al., 2015) installed on the same air-
craft. Details about the Saﬁre Falcon 20 ﬂights, the lidar
LNG, and the dropsonde launching unit can be found in For-
menti et al. (2019). In the following we shall only analyze li-
dar and dropsonde data acquired on 5 and 6 September 2017.
On 5 September, the Falcon 20 circuit from and to
Walvis Bay was performed counterclockwise from 07:36 to
10:14 UTC (ﬂight F06). On 6 September, the Falcon 20
circuit was performed clockwise from 10:55 to 14:01 UTC
(ﬂight F09). The ﬂight paths during the AEROCLO-sA cam-
paign aimed at characterizing BBA- or dust-related emission
or transport processes over speciﬁc areas or at a particular
time of day. The clockwise or counterclockwise orientations
of the ﬂights were therefore dictated by the need to adapt to
the speciﬁc emission and transport conditions expected for
each ﬂight.
On
both
ﬂights,
the
aircraft
ﬂew
around
10 km a.m.s.l. (above mean sea level), except on 6 September
between 11:45 and 12:18 UTC, when the aircraft performed
a sounding and penetrated the BBA layer over the Etosha
pan. In the following, we will discuss the dynamics and ther-
modynamics proﬁles from two dropsondes released over the
Etosha pan at nearly the same location: 16.445◦E/18.772◦S
on 5 September at 08:39 UTC and 16.401◦E/18.766◦S on
6 September at 11:46 UTC. We also compare these proﬁles
with the one obtained in the vicinity of Henties Bay, over the
ocean at 13.78◦E/21.69◦S on 5 September at 09:51 UTC,
and with those obtained south of Etosha at 16.33◦E/21.74◦S
on 6 September at 11:37 UTC. Note that the dropsonde data
acquired during AEROCLO-sA have not been assimilated in
the ECMWF operational analysis or in the reanalysis.

The signal backscattered to the LNG system telescope at
1064 nm is range square corrected to produce atmospheric re-
ﬂectivity. Total attenuated backscatter coefﬁcient (ABC) pro-
ﬁles are derived from atmospheric reﬂectivity proﬁles by nor-
malizing the atmospheric reﬂectivity above the aerosol layers
to the molecular backscatter coefﬁcient proﬁles. Hence the
slope of the lidar reﬂectivity above 7.5 km a.m.s.l. matched
that of the molecular backscatter derived from dropsonde
measurements of pressure and temperature. In the follow-
ing, we only use ABC at 1064 nm because the attenuation
by the BBA in the lower troposphere, in spite of being im-
portant, does not prevent the lidar signal from reaching the
surface, unlike at the other wavelengths of operation of LNG
(i.e., 355 and 532 nm). The vertical resolution of the ABC
proﬁles is 30 m. Proﬁles are averaged over 5 s, yielding a hor-
izontal resolution of 1 km for an aircraft ﬂying at 200 m s−1
on average. It is worth noting that ABC as observed with
LNG is sensitive to both aerosol concentration and aerosol
hygroscopicity. Indeed, relative humidity (RH) in excess of
60 % modiﬁes the size and the complex refractive index of
aerosol and hence their optical properties, enhancing the
ABC (e.g., Randriamiarisoa et al., 2006). Extinction coef-
ﬁcients at 1064 nm are retrieved from ABC proﬁles using a
standard lidar inversion method that employs a lidar ratio of
40 sr, characteristic of BBA. The retrievals have an estimated
uncertainty of 15 %.
2.2.3
Space-borne observations
We make use of AOT (at 550 nm) and ﬁre hotspot lo-
cations from the National Aeronautics and Space Admin-
istration Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
(NASA MODIS; King et al., 1992). We also make use of
ABC and aerosol typing products obtained from the space-
borne Cloud-Aerosol Transport System (CATS; Yorks et
al., 2016) to gather information on the vertical structure of
aerosol and cloud layers as well as aerosol composition over
Namibia from two overpasses on 4 and 5 September 2017.
Details about the space-borne products used in this study can
be found in Chazette et al. (2019). The horizontal distribu-
tion of the smoke plumes is also described daily with total
column amounts of carbon monoxide (CO) derived from ra-
diance spectra measured by the Infrared Atmospheric Sound-
ing Spectrometer (IASI; Clerbaux et al., 2009) on board the
MetOp-A and MetOp-B satellites and overpassing the re-
gion around 08:30 and 09:00 LT (local time), respectively.
This satellite dataset is retrieved using the Fast Optimal Re-
trievals on Layers for IASI algorithm (Hurtmans et al., 2012)
and validated against airborne and space-borne observations
(George et al., 2009; De Wachter et al., 2012). Finally, we uti-
lize RGB natural color imagery of cloud cover obtained with
the Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SE-
VIRI) instrument on board the geostationary satellite Me-
teoSat Second Generation.

Synoptic conditions over southern Africa: a tale
of two features
3.1
The life cycle of the CoL and the TTT
In the low levels, the northern part of Namibia is under the in-
ﬂuence of easterly ﬂow, and on 1 September a marked coastal
trough is seen along the western coast of Namibia, west
of the instrumented sites, associated with an easterly wave
(Fig. 2a). In the following days (2–3 September), a weak
coastal trough is seen to develop offshore (Fig. 2b and c).
Further south, a belt of high-pressure systems is present
in the vicinity of the tip of the southern African subconti-
nent (e.g., Fig. 2a–c). From 4 September, as the baroclinic
westerly ﬂow approaches the western coast, a distinct low
forms over Angola and northern Namibia within the east-
erly ﬂow (Fig. 2d–f), which corresponds to the Angola low in
the mid troposphere. During the same period, the southeast-
ern Atlantic high-pressure system (St. Helena anticyclone) is
strengthening (Fig. 2d). Its eastern fringe approaches the land
on 5 September (Fig. 2e) and even intrudes over the subcon-
tinent on 6 September (Fig. 2f).
Figure 3 shows the evolution of the ERA5 geopotential
and PV at 300 hPa at 12:00 UTC over the area of interest. On
1 September, the instrumented sites over northern Namibia
are under the inﬂuence of a westerly ﬂow in the upper lev-
els, which is clearly separated from the main westerlies lo-
cated poleward of 40◦S (Fig. 3a). The split in the westerlies
is generally associated with the breaking of the upper level
jet and is seen upstream of southern Africa at 10◦W (Favre
et al., 2012). Strong negative PV is associated with the cy-
clonic circulation in the area of separation between the main
westerlies and the northern westerlies branch, just west of the
Namibian coastline. On 2 September, the region of splitting
reaches the coastline, and some of the instrumented sites in
the southern part of the domain and along the coast are un-
der the inﬂuence of a southerly ﬂow, while the sites to the
north are under a westerly ﬂow (Fig. 3b). The maximum of
negative PV is located approximately above the AERONET
HESS site. The main westerly ﬂow exhibits a pronounced
poleward dip just west of the tip of South Africa which is
further enhanced on the following day, when the closed cir-
culation has formed and is centered over the region of the
AERONET Bonanza site (Fig. 3c). This closed circulation
now contains the strongest negative PV feature. In the ERA5
reanalysis, ascending motion is present to the north and east
of the CoL center, while descending motion is highlighted to
the south and west of the CoL center (Fig. S1a in the Sup-
plement). The CoL is positioned in the same area the next
day (4 September, Fig. 3d), with the instrumented sites being
essentially beneath the negative PV associated with the CoL.
On this day also, ascending motion is present to the north
and east of the CoL center, while descending motion is high-
lighted to the south and west of the CoL center (Fig. S1b).
The CoL starts deforming shortly after, becomes elongated

in the north–south direction and can be seen as an elongated
ﬁlament of negative PV to the east of most of the instru-
mented sites located in Namibia. It then moves poleward and
merges back with the main westerly ﬂow between 09:00 and
12:00 UTC on 5 September (not shown). The area of interest
lies below a hump in the northwesterly ﬂow on the eastern
side of the poleward dip of the westerlies (Fig. 3e). Finally,
on 6 September, the area of interest is under a rather weak
east-northeasterly ﬂow, north of the main westerlies located
south of 40◦S (Fig. 3f). The ﬁlament of negative PV mark-
ing the remains of the CoL has now moved further southeast
over South Africa and over the Indian Ocean.

shows, equatorward of the strong westerlies, the presence of
a high-pressure system over the southern tip of the conti-
nent as well as an isolated low-pressure feature (connected
with the CoL) located offshore of Namibia, over the Atlantic
Ocean (Fig. 4a). The cyclonic and anticyclonic circulations
associated with the CoL and the high pressure, respectively,
create conditions that are favorable to the advection of BBA
poleward, between them as shown by Chazette et al. (2019).
It is worth noting that, at this level, both the low- and high-
pressure features are characterized by low BBA-related AOT.
As the wave in the westerly ﬂow at 70 hPa approaches the
western coast of southern Africa on 4 September, the high
pressure moves eastward and is partly over the Indian Ocean
(Fig. 4b). At the same time, the low pressure becomes elon-
gated and is oriented almost parallel to the coastline (a shape
that resembles that observed at 300 hPa on 4 September;
see Fig. 3d). The poleward advection of BBA at 700 hPa
becomes more pronounced and results in the formation of
the river of smoke. On 5 September (Fig. 4c), the equator-
ward dip of the westerly ﬂow is now positioned over south-
ern Africa and the high pressure has moved over the Indian
Ocean, generating a TTT aligned with the Namibian coast.
The resulting circulation promotes the poleward advection
of a more massive river of smoke extending over the east-
ern coast of southern Africa and over the Indian Ocean and
extends poleward almost to 50◦S. The signature of the CoL
at 700 hPa is no longer identiﬁable. BBAs over the Atlantic
Ocean related to biomass burning events over South Amer-
ica are also observed by Chazette et al. (2019). Finally, on
6 September, the St. Helena anticyclone pushes the pole-
ward dip of the westerlies and the TTT further east, while
the high-pressure system over the Indian Ocean also weak-
ens (Fig. 4d). The river of smoke is now well established
over southern Africa and is located further east, particularly
over South Africa.

Dynamical controls
The variability of the BBA distribution in the period 1–
6 September is compared with the atmospheric circulation
variability by means of a PCA. The ﬁrst EOF of the or-
ganic matter AOT (Fig. 5a), explaining 55 % of the vari-
ability, shows a negative anomaly in the BBA transport until
4 September and a river of smoke developing over Namibia
on 5 and 6 September (red line in Fig. 5e). BBAs are mainly
transported at 700 hPa, and the evolution of the river of
smoke is controlled by the circulation at this level. The ﬁrst
EOF of the geopotential at 700 hPa (Fig. 5c), explaining
74 % of the variability at this level, shows on 1–2 September
a positive gradient along the northeast–southwest direction,
which drives a southeasterly ﬂow inhibiting the northerly
BBA transport. The gradient reverses on 4 September (green
line in Fig. 5e), favoring the southward penetration of the
river of smoke. The control on the BBA exerted by the circu-
lation at 700 hPa is conﬁrmed by the high correlation (0.78,
Table 1) of PCA time series in Fig. 5e. The ﬁrst EOF of the
geopotential at 300 hPa (Fig. 5b), explaining 56 % of the vari-
ability, shows the transit of the CoL along the meridional di-
rection, migrating from southern Namibia on 1 September
to central Namibia on 3–4 September and retreating to the
south on 5–6 September (blue line in Fig. 5e). The evolu-
tion of the AOT and geopotential PCAs suggests a possible
control of the river of smoke by the CoL from 4 September
onwards (PCA correlation is 0.50, Table 1), when a high-
to low-pressure dipole (Fig. 5b) favors the channeling of the
BBA along the Namibian coast. The ﬁrst EOF of the MSLP
(Fig. 5d), explaining 43 % of the variability, shows a coastal
trough on 1–2 September evolving into a coastal ridge on
3–4 September (black line in Fig. 5e). The associated north-

westerly ﬂow could have a role in favoring the installation
of the river of smoke. However, the comparison of the PCAs
(Table 1) shows no stable relationship between the conditions
at the surface and the BBA transport. In conclusion, the CoL
and the circulation at 300 hPa have a dominating inﬂuence
on the circulation around 700 hPa (∼4 km a.m.s.l.) and con-
sequently on the tropospheric composition over Namibia, as
the circulation at this level controls the distribution of BBA
away from the main sources.

6 September over the continent (Fig. 6e) thanks to the mostly
cloud-free conditions over southern Africa on that day. On
the other hand, the river of smoke on 5 September is more
difﬁcult to detect with the MODIS observations (Fig. 6c)
due to its co-location with a band of mid-level clouds posi-
tioned along the Namibian coastline. CO retrievals depict the
river of smoke on both 5 and 6 September (Fig. S2c and d),
as these measurements can also be retrieved above low-
and mid-level relatively thin clouds. On 3–4 September, en-
hanced CO amounts (adjacent to clouds, shown as blanks in
the ﬁgure) already show an elongated plume over the Atlantic
extending from northwest to southeast over the latitude band
10–40◦S, which probably corresponds to the river of smoke
transported eastwards over the continent and enhanced in
concentration on the 2 following days. This plume structure
is simulated by CAMS reanalysis for BBA but only extends
southwards to 30◦S. After 5 September, the CO distributions
also depict the plume originating from South America, lo-
cated over the Atlantic (at 25–35◦S, Fig. S2c and d). This
plume presents similar CO amounts to that of the river of
smoke (3–3.5×1018 molec cm−2), and it is transported east-
wards until it reaches the western South African coast on
6 September (Chazette et al., 2019). This is qualitatively con-
sistent with the BBA plume shown by CAMS reanalysis, but
these last ones show a relatively less dense plume as com-
pared with that of the river of smoke.
On 5 September, the space-borne lidar CATS overpassed
southern Namibia at around 22:00 UTC across the mid-
level cloud band (Fig. 7a), just to the south of the Bonanza
AERONET station (Fig. 6c). CATS provides further observa-
tional evidence that BBA dominates the aerosol composition
of the low troposphere over continental southern Africa dur-
ing the period of interest (Fig. 7b). Smoke is seen to be well
mixed over the depth of the boundary layer (∼3 km) over
northern Botswana and Zambia, where ﬁres are observed to
be very active and widespread (Fig. 6d). Interestingly, the
depth of the smoke layer is seen to be much deeper over con-
tinental Namibia, its top reaching almost 7.5 km a.m.s.l. in
the vicinity of the mid-level cloud band. The smoke is ob-
served to reach the coastline above 3 km a.m.s.l., consis-
tent with MODIS observations. At lower altitude, CATS
evidences the presence of pollution at the coast and mar-
itime aerosols further west of the continent, over the ocean
(Fig. 7b).
The river of smoke is anchored over Angola and north-
ern Namibia, the latter location being where most airborne
and ground-based observations were acquired in the course
of the AEROCLO-sA campaign. While the CATS obser-

vations suggest that further south the BBA layer is ad-
vected eastward, it appears from the CAMS reanalysis and
MODIS observations that the region where BBA feeds into
the river of smoke does not move signiﬁcantly. This is con-
ﬁrmed by the fact that large AOTs are observed over north-
ern Namibia (AERONET Sun-photometer station in Wind-
poort, Fig. 8a) between 3 and 7 September, as opposed to
the other AERONET stations further south (Bonanza, HESS,
Upington, Fig. 8b–d) where more sporadic AOT peaks are
observed, suggesting a propagating BBA feature over this
area. Large BBA-related AOT values are seen with CAMS
in the vicinity of the Etosha pan region (Fig. 4c and d) that
correspond to the maximum in AOT seen with AERONET
over the station of Windpoort (Fig. 8a). The aerosol load
is seen to increase over Windpoort from 1 to 6 September
(when it reaches 1.75 at 500 nm) and to decrease thereafter.
The AOT values in Windpoort are systematically higher than
AOTs derived from other AERONET stations further south.
The timing of the AOT peaks obtained with CAMS is consis-
tent with its Sun-photometer-derived counterpart. The AOT
peak in the CAMS reanalysis suggests that the smoke river
overpassed the HESS site at around 12:00 UTC on 5 Septem-
ber, the Upington site at 00:00 UTC on 6 September and
the Bonanza site at 18:00 UTC on the same day, suggest-

ing an eastward drift of the smoke river. The data from the
AERONET sites are consistent with the MODIS data in both
magnitude and timing of the increased AOT values (Fig. 6c
and e). The river of smoke is clearly observed as an identiﬁ-
able isolated feature sweeping through Upington, i.e., away
from the ﬁre emissions, as opposed to what is observed fur-
ther north in Windpoort, which is closer to Angola and Zam-
bia. The good agreement between the AOT from MODIS and
CAMS at Windpoort and Bonanza (Fig. 8a and b) is expected
as MODIS AOTs are assimilated in the CAMS retrieval al-
gorithm. Good agreement is also found between CAMS and
AERONET AOTs at Upington (Fig. 8d) and to a lesser ex-
tent at HESS and Bonanza (Fig. 8b and c, especially be-
fore 6 September). Windpoort (Fig. 8a) is an exception, with
AERONET AOTs differing signiﬁcantly at times from the
MODIS and CAMS retrievals. The higher Sun-photometer
AOTs are most likely to be BBA dominated, a fact that is
highlighted by the average Angström coefﬁcient values de-
rived from the AERONET observations in Windpoort of 1.7
(between 440 and 870 nm), which is consistent with previ-
ous ﬁndings evidencing that the absorption Angström ex-
ponent of biomass smoke is typically between 1.5 and 2
(e.g., Bergstrom et al., 2007).
4.2
Airborne observations and model simulation
In the latter stage of the CoL intrusion over Namibia (5 and
6 September), a large-scale mid-level cloud band is visible
along the southern Africa western coastline at 09:00 UTC on
5 September, as already highlighted using MODIS (Fig. 6c)
and conﬁrmed using SEVIRI (Fig. S3a), i.e., around the time
the Falcon 20 aircraft ﬂew on that day. The presence of this
cloud band is related to the presence of the TTT (Ratna et al.,
2013) and is triggered by the arrival of an upper-level trough
over southern Africa associated with the band of divergence
east of its leading edge. Nearly cloud-free conditions are ob-
served over northern continental Namibia at this time. The
mid-level cloud band moved inland rapidly, together with the
river of smoke, and covered a large part of Namibia in the
afternoon as shown with SEVIRI at 16:00 UTC (Fig. S3b).
It sweeps through Namibia overnight and is observed over
eastern Namibia at 06:00 UTC on 6 September (Fig. S3c) be-
fore starting to disintegrate. Almost cloud-free conditions are
seen after 12:00 UTC (the cloud band is no longer visible in
Fig. S3d) at the time of the Falcon 20 aircraft ﬂight on that
day. On 5 September, airborne observations acquired in the
morning are representative of conditions ahead of the cloud
band sweeping across Namibia, while the airborne data ac-
quired on the afternoon of 6 September were acquired over
Namibia after its passage.
The observations made with the airborne lidar LNG over
Windpoort and the Etosha region on 5 and 6 September
(Fig. 9a and b, respectively) clearly evidence the complex-
ity of the layering within the BBA-laden air masses. On
5 September, the BBA layer is observed between ∼2 and
6 km a.m.s.l. and is separated from the surface (reaching an
elevation of 1.5 km a.m.s.l. over the plateau) by a shallow de-
veloping convective boundary layer in which dust emissions
from the Etosha pan are observed (Formenti et al., 2019). On
the other hand, the BBA layer is separated from the surface
away from the plateau and over the ocean (beginning and
end of ﬂight). On 6 September, the BBA layer is clearly ob-
served to be mixed all the way down to the surface over the
plateau and to reach ∼6 km a.m.s.l., thereby extending over
a depth of nearly 4.5 km. The vertical structure of the Meso-
NH-derived BB carbon tracer along the ﬂight tracks on both
days is given in Fig. 9c and d. On 5 September, the greater
vertical extent of the BBA layer over the continental plateau
(with respect to the surrounding lower lands and ocean) at the
beginning and end of the ﬂight is well captured in the model

(Fig. 9c). Likewise, the decrease in the BBA layer over the
sloping terrain towards the ocean at the end of the ﬂight on
6 September is also well represented (Fig. 9d). On 6 Septem-
ber, large concentrations of BB carbon tracers are mixed all
the way to the surface, as in the observations, in the northern
part of the ﬂight (i.e., overpassing the Etosha pan). In con-
trast, the larger BB carbon tracer concentrations do not reach
the surface in the morning, which was also observed with the
airborne lidar.

Analysis of BBA transport on 5 September
Meso-NH-derived

trajectories
ending
at
09:00 UTC 5 September 2017 along the F06 ﬂight track and
at altitudes between 1 and 5 km a.m.s.l. (Fig. 10a, c and d)
show that over the previous 3 d the air masses documented
with the airborne lidar LNG during the ﬂight had traveled
over regions with detectable active ﬁres (Fig. 5) and where
BB carbon emissions are high in the GFED4s inventory
(Fig. S4). The trajectories are transport emissions from
Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique, where ﬁres
are identiﬁed with MODIS (Fig. 6). Airborne observations
and simulations show unambiguously that the atmospheric
composition below 5 km a.m.s.l. along the aircraft ﬂight
track is dominated by BBA from Angola and Mozambique
(see Fig. 6) coming from altitudes below 5 km a.m.s.l. and
swirling anticyclonically around a high pressure in the lower
troposphere (Fig. 10). It is worth noting that the air masses
ending at 4–5 km a.m.s.l. along the aircraft track all expe-
rience upgliding in the previous 24 h (Fig. S5a), while the
BB carbon tracer concentration is gradually increasing over
the 3 d for all air masses below 5 km a.m.s.l. (Fig. S5b). At
higher altitudes (i.e., 6–7 km a.m.s.l.), backward trajectories
ending north of the Etosha pan also start from Angola and
Zambia below 5 km a.m.s.l. (Fig. 10b), while those ending
south of the Etosha pan originate from higher altitudes
(between 8 and 11 km a.m.s.l.) and from the southeast,
having traveled over Botswana, Mozambique and South
Africa, and swirl cyclonically around the location of the
CoL while descending along its poleward fringes (recall
that the CoL is located between Henties Bay, Bonanza
and Windpoort on 3–4 September; Fig. 3c and d). The
downgliding experienced by the air masses occurs in the
previous 2 d (Fig. S5a). The ERA5 data show the presence
of ascending motion to the north and east of the CoL center
and descending motion to the south and west of the CoL
center (see Sect. 3).
Airborne lidar observations evidence that, over the ocean,
the height of the cumulus clouds is observed to coincide
with the top of the BBA layer (Fig. 9a). The dropsonde-
derived RH and potential temperature proﬁles acquired over
the ocean (Fig. 11a) show the presence of a strong RH
and temperature inversion at 6 km a.m.s.l., topped by ex-
tremely dry air layer from the west (270◦), consistent with
the backward trajectories seen in the southern part of the
F06 ﬂight track (Fig. 10b). This suggests a descent of up-
per tropospheric air along the southern fringes of the CoL.
Directional wind shear is observed in the BBA layer with
northerly winds at the bottom (∼2 km a.m.s.l.) and north-
northwesterly winds near the top (∼6 km a.m.s.l., Fig. 11b),

with the BBA layer being advected towards the ocean at
a speed of ∼15 m s−1. Over the Etosha pan, dry upper
tropospheric air is observed above 7 km a.m.s.l., with sig-
niﬁcant RH above 6 km a.m.s.l. (Fig. 11c). This, together
with the lidar-derived ABC observations, suggests that the
BBA layer top can reach almost 7 km a.m.s.l. (enhanced
ABC is observed above 6 km a.m.s.l., i.e., above isolated
cumulus-type clouds forming over land). The wind direc-
tion in the air mass encompassing the upper part of the BBA
layer is seen to be remarkably consistent with winds from
north-northwest between 4 and 7 km a.m.s.l. (Fig. 11d), in
agreement with the backward trajectories in the northern
part of the F06 ﬂight track (Fig. 10a). In conclusion, the
dropsonde-derived RH proﬁle over Etosha between 5.5 and
7 km a.m.s.l. suggests large-scale ascending motion above
the BBA layer over the continental plateau, as opposed to
the nearby ocean, where the RH proﬁle suggests strong sub-
sidence associated with the South Atlantic high. Enhanced
ABC above 6 km a.m.s.l. is not related to differential trans-
port of BBA layers of different origin but rather to the lifting
of the top of the BBA layer (with non-negligible RH val-
ues contributing an increased lidar backscatter signal by hy-
droscopic growth of aerosols). The presence of BB carbon
tracers above 6 km a.m.s.l. is also seen in the Meso-NH sim-
ulation (Fig. 9c). Backward trajectories computed between
6 and 7 km a.m.s.l. in that area (between kilometers 400
and 1000 in Fig. 9a) are nearly all associated with air masses
from the northeast, i.e., the ﬁre-prone regions of Angola and
Zambia. These backward trajectories are seen to upglide to
almost 8.5 km a.m.s.l. in the 24 h preceding their arrival over
the Etosha pan region (not shown). This provides further con-
ﬁrmation of ascending motion above the BBA layer over the
Etosha pan region, consistent with air moving in the easterly
low wave.

track on 6 September. Backward trajectories between 1 and
5 km a.m.s.l. (Fig. 12a, c and d) are very similar to those
seen on 5 September, with air masses having traveled over
Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique before reach-
ing northern Namibia. The BB carbon tracer concentrations
increase along the path of the trajectories towards Namibia
(Fig. S5d). On both 5 and 6 September, the air masses orig-
inate from the northeast (Fig. 12), ending between 4 and
5 km a.m.s.l. All trajectories show signiﬁcant lofting in the
previous 24 h prior to reaching the area of the Falcon ﬂight.
Above, the backward trajectories ending along the ﬂight
track are essentially coming from the southeast and are de-
scending from 11 to 7 km upon reaching the area of inter-
est (Fig. 12b). Only a few trajectories ending in the Etosha
pan region originate from the northeast (as opposed to the
previous day, when a signiﬁcant number of such trajecto-
ries were seen). On this day, vertical motion above the BBA
layer is dominated by subsiding dry air masses traveling
along the southern fringes of the CoL during the previous
3 d (Fig. S5c). On 6 September, these descending trajecto-
ries extend much further over the ocean than on the previous
day (compare Figs. 10b and 12b). This is consistent with the
fact that the CoL was well established over the area of the
ﬂight 2 d prior to the ﬂight (i.e., on 4 September, Fig. 3d),
more so than the CoL on 3 September (Fig. 3c) 2 d prior to
the ﬂight on 5 September. As a result of the dominance of
the descending air masses over northern Namibia, a sharp
RH transition to very dry conditions is observed at the top
of the BBA layer, above 6.5 km a.m.s.l., along the southern
part of the F09 ﬂight track (Fig. 11e). Likewise, the top of
the BBA layer over Etosha is signiﬁcantly lower than on the
previous day, even though the structure of the RH proﬁle in
the upper part of the BBA layer suggests weaker ascending
motion (Fig. 11f) than on 5 September. The RH and poten-
tial temperature proﬁles acquired over the Etosha pan con-
ﬁrm the presence of a deeper convective boundary layer on
6 September (with a top at 4 km a.m.s.l.) due to the fact that
the ﬂight took place later in the day than on 5 September
(the top of the convective boundary layer being observed at
2 km a.m.s.l.). The maxima of RH are observed to be slightly

The impact of the CoL on the tropospheric
composition over the subcontinent
In the previous section, we showed that the mid-tropospheric
circulation associated with the presence of the CoL poten-
tially modulates the depth of the underlying widespread layer
of the smoke layer over northern Namibia. The modulation
appears to be forced by the vertical motion associated with
the CoL, i.e., subsiding air parcels to the south and west of
its center and ascending motion to the north and east of it.
In the following, we provide further evidence of this modu-
lation over northern Namibia, where the CoL was observed
to be intense during 2 d (3 and 4 September) by looking at
the evolution of the vertical distribution of BB carbon tracers
and potential vorticity, among other variables, using Meso-
NH simulations and ERA5 reanalysis.
The horizontal extent of the CoL over northern Namibia
and more particularly above three Sun-photometer stations
(namely Henties Bay, Windpoort and Bonanza) on 3 and
4 September 2017 was highlighted using ERA5-derived PV
in Fig. 3. The time–height cross section of the PV over
Windpoort from 1 to 6 September (Fig. 13a) evidences the
presence of the CoL from midday on 2 September until the
end of 4 September, associated with negative PV (less than
4 × 10−6 K m2 kg−1 s−1) and cyclonic circulation, between
400 and 300 hPa. In the lower troposphere, the shallow noc-
turnal boundary layer is also associated with negative PV and
cyclonic circulation. The top of the nocturnal boundary layer
is found around 875 hPa. In comparison, the deeper daytime
PBL is associated with positive PV and anticyclonic circula-
tion. The strongest ascending motions in the mid troposphere
(800–400 hPa) are seen between 12:00 UTC on 2 September
and 12:00 UTC on 3 September (Fig. 13b). This strong verti-
cal motion is associated with the sloping negative PV struc-
ture related to the incoming CoL (Fig. 13a). Concomitantly,
RH above 600 hPa increases dramatically up to 400 hPa at
12:00 UTC on 3 September (Fig. 13c), together with the
cloud cover (Fig. 13d). The cloud cover is found to decrease
after 3 September, unlike RH, which remains high above

600 hPa in the following days. The peak in cloud cover over
Windpoort on 3 September is consistent with the space-borne
observations made with SEVIRI (Fig. S6b), which shows the
presence of an isolated patch of mid-level clouds south of the
Etosha pan region on 2 September at 12:00 UTC and over
the area of Etosha on 3 September at 12:00 UTC (Fig. S6a
and b). Overall, the mid-level cloud cover above continental
Namibia is low, and the isolated nature of the mid-level cloud
patches on 2 and 3 September suggests that they are formed
locally rather than being advected from another area. On
4 September, the space-borne lidar CATS overpassed north-
ern Namibia, just to the north of the Etosha pan during the
daytime and across the CoL (Fig. 6a). The CATS observa-
tions evidence that the PBL is the deepest seen over the con-
tinental plateau along the transect (Fig. S6d) and that mid-
level clouds are forming on top of the PBL to the north of the
center of the CoL. This is also strong evidence that the CoL
generates strong local ascending motion in the lower tropo-
sphere, leading to the formation of an isolated cloud patch,
also visible on the SEVIRI images (Fig. S6c).
The Meso-NH-derived time–height evolution of smoke
tracer concentrations, vorticity and cloud liquid water over
Windpoort between 1 and 6 September 2017 is shown
in Fig. 14a. Even though the largest BB carbon tracer
concentrations are seen after 12:00 UTC on 5 September
(i.e., the time when the airborne observations discussed
above were acquired), the simulation shows that the deep-
est BBA layer over Windpoort occurred late on 3 September
(12:00–21:00 UTC) as well as late on 4 September (18:00–
21:00 UTC) in connection with the presence of CoL-related
potential vorticity in the upper troposphere, reaching to-
wards the surface to altitudes between 6 and 7 km a.m.s.l.
On this occasion, the top of the BBA layer reaches at least
8 km a.m.s.l., while later on, i.e., on 5 and 6 September, the
top of the BBA layer is between 6 and 6.5 km a.m.s.l., as with
the airborne lidar measurements in the area of Windpoort
(∼900 km into the ﬂight in Fig. 9a and ∼250 km into the
ﬂight in Fig. 9b). The liquid water content at the top of the
BBA layer increases from 1 to 3 September, together with
the height of the condensation level (Fig. 14a), both vari-
ables reaching their maximum values late on 3 September,
i.e., shortly after the descent of mid-tropospheric vorticity
on that day. On 4 and 5 September, the level of condensa-
tion is much lower (between 4 and 6 km a.m.s.l.) and within
the BBA layer, in accordance with the lidar observations
(∼400 and 850 km into ﬂight no. 6 in Fig. 9a). Further south,
in Upington (Fig. 14b), the presence of mid-tropospheric po-
tential vorticity is at altitudes as low as 7 km a.m.s.l. around

midday on 5 September. Later that day, Meso-NH simulates
the deepest BBA layer of the period, the top of the layer
reaching between 7 and 8 km a.m.s.l. The simulation repro-
duces consistently the sporadic nature of the event in Up-
ington associated with the advection of the river of smoke
observed in Sect. 4, with large BB carbon tracer concentra-
tions occurring late on 5 September over a large depth in the
lower troposphere. It is worth noting that liquid water is seen
to extend from 4 to 7 km a.m.s.l., thereby suggesting thick
clouds embedded in the river of smoke, in accordance with
observations from MODIS (horizontal distribution, Fig. 6)
and from CATS (vertical distribution, Fig. 7) as well as from
SEVIRI regarding clouds (Fig. S6). For instance, Hennigan
et al. (2012) discuss how the production of secondary or-
ganic aerosol in BBA plumes signiﬁcantly enhances cloud
condensation nuclei concentrations and how global model
simulations predict that nucleation in photochemically aging
ﬁre plumes produces dramatically higher cloud condensation
nuclei concentrations over widespread areas of the South-
ern Hemisphere during the dry, burning season (September–
October).
The characteristics of the river of smoke (timing, vertical
extent of the BBA layer) seen in Upington based on Meso-
NH simulations cannot be seen further north (e.g., in Wind-
poort), as northern Namibia was under the inﬂuence of a
well-formed, stationary, isolated CoL on 3 and 4 Septem-
ber (Fig. 3c and d), unlike South Africa, over which the
fast-evolving CoL traveled southeastward between 5 and 6
September while merging back with the main westerly ﬂow
(Fig. 3e and f). Hence, the picture emerges that the charac-
teristics of the river of smoke are very much tied to the later
(fast-evolving) stage of the evolution of the CoL than the
earlier (stationary) stage. The model results discussed in this
section highlight the mechanisms by which the CoL observed
over southern Africa at the beginning of September 2017
inﬂuences the vertical structure of the BBA layer, essen-

tially through the CoL-related ascending/descending motion
above the BBA layer. The deepest BBA layers over northern
Namibia could not be observed with the airborne platform
operated during AEROCLO-sA. Nevertheless, the Meso-NH
simulation for the period 5–6 September being very consis-
tent with the observations gathered during the campaign, we
are conﬁdent that the Meso-NH-derived structure of the BBA
layer over northern Namibia during the stationary phase of
the CoL is realistic.

Summary and conclusions
The formation of a river of smoke crossing southern Africa
was investigated during the Aerosols, Radiation and Clouds
in southern Africa (AEROCLO-sA) campaign for 2 to
6 September 2017 in connection with a mid-level TTT and
a CoL, using a complementary set of global and mesoscale
numerical simulations as well as ground-based, airborne and
space-borne observations.
Numerical simulations performed with the high-resolution
Meso-NH model together with space-borne lidar observa-
tion made with CATS provide evidence that the top of
the BBA layer over northern Namibia (where the CoL re-
mained stationary for 2 d) may reach altitudes higher than
8 km a.m.s.l. This is much higher that the height of the top
of the BBA layer over the regions where the smoke origi-
nates from (Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique), i.e.,
∼5 to 6 km a.m.s.l. The impact of the CoL-driven TTT on
the vertical distribution of BBA was also felt further south,
over South Africa, in the form of a river of smoke as the CoL
was rapidly traveling southwestward before merging with the
westerlies. The TTT created favorable conditions for efﬁ-
ciently transporting BBA-prone tropical air masses towards
the southwestern Indian Ocean. The temporal evolution of
the river of smoke was found to be connected to the fast-
evolving stage of the CoL. Besides favoring the increase in
the BBA layer top, the ascending motion associated with the
CoL also promoted the occurrence of mid-level clouds over
northern Namibia in the early (stationary) phase of the CoL
evolution (2–4 September, Fig. 15a), while cloud-free con-
ditions were observed everywhere else over the continent.
In the fast-evolving stage of the CoL (5 and 6 September,
Fig. 15b and c, respectively), a band of mid-level clouds was
embedded in the river of smoke that were related to the cir-
culation in the lee of the CoL.
Even though the CoL observed on 3–6 September 2017
did not impact the circulation at the surface directly, the
Meso-NH simulation provides unambiguous evidence that
the river of smoke event that swept through western South
Africa (i.e., away from the region of ﬁres) not only had a
mid-tropospheric signature, but also that air quality asso-
ciated with the transported BBA was reaching the surface,
as illustrated in Upington. Such behavior was also observed
during SAFARI 2000 by Magi et al. (2003) and Schmid et

al. (2003). These authors have also shown that the height of
the top of the BBA layer decreased signiﬁcantly from north-
west to southeast, i.e., between ﬁre-prone regions in the trop-
ics and the exit region of the river of smoke. The altitude of
the top of the BBA layer observed during AEROCLO-sA is
consistent with that measured over Zambia during SAFARI
2000 (Schmid et al., 2003).
To the authors’ knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time the link
between the CoL dynamics and the formation of a river of
smoke is established. The CoL was an essential ingredient
of the TTT that developed across southern Africa. TTTs are
known to comprise the dominant rainfall-producing weather
system over southern Africa during the austral summer. Here,
we demonstrate that TTTs also play a role in the transport of
BBA during the winter.
Future research will aim at consolidating our understand-
ing of the impact of the main dynamical features high-
lighted in this study (CoL, TTT, Angola low) on the forma-
tion and the evolution of rivers of smoke over the southern
African subcontinent. Among overarching open questions to
be investigated using ERA5/CAMS reanalysis and satellite
aerosols products, we shall assess (1) what is the frequency
of “rivers of smoke” during the austral winter, (2) how impor-
tant is this mechanism for the transport of CO and aerosols
out of southern Africa compared with the other transport
patterns identiﬁed by Garstang et al. (1996), (3) whether
CoLs and/or TTTs are systematically associated with rivers
of smoke and (4) what is the importance/role of the Angola
low in promoting the accumulation of BBA in the tropical
band prior to their injection in smoke rivers.
