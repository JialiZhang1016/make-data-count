Abstract 
23 
Climate can have profound effects on reproductive behavior and physiology, especially in 
24 
ectothermic animals. In amphibians, the evolution of breeding period due to climate has 
25 
received little attention despite its direct connection to fitness and relevance to conservation. We 
26 
used phylogenetic comparative methods to analyze a global dataset of frog breeding periods, 
27 
climate, body size, and microhabitat for 497 species (41 of 54 families). We found support for 
28 
the hypothesis that breeding periods are longer in the warmer, wetter, aseasonal tropics and 
29 
shorter in the colder, dryer, seasonal temperate zone. However, this latitudinal reproduction 
30 
gradient is more complex than expected; the effect of climate depends on body size. 
31 
Additionally, breeding periods were similar across microhabitats. Overall, our model describes 
32 
~20% of variation in breeding periods and these results are robust to phylogenetic uncertainty. 
33 
Our results set within an eco-physiology framework have broad implications for more targeted 
34 
priorities in amphibian conservation.

Introduction 
39 
Climate change is increasingly threatening global biodiversity with increasing extinctions 
40 
as environments are altered (Arneth et al. 2020; Bellard et al. 2012; Thomas et al. 2004; Urban 
41 
2015). While climate change is a growing problem in the present, its past effects have molded 
42 
the behavior and physiology of species still around today. Thus, by studying coevolution 
43 
between organisms and the environment, we can better understand how climate change will 
44 
differentially affect species survival. Importantly, evolutionary biology is taking a key role in 
45 
conservation biology (Zizka et al. 2021), with climate change and anthropogenic impacts at the 
46 
heart of these studies. As successful reproduction is necessary for survival and fitness, studies 
47 
of the ecology and evolution of reproductive traits are needed to understand the effects of 
48 
climate change on species reproductive success. For example, climate change has led to 
49 
shifting clutch sizes, offspring sizes, and breeding season start times in vertebrates (Bronson 
50 
2009; Padilla Perez and Angilletta 2022; Pankhurst and Munday 2011; Telemeco et al. 2013; 
51 
Todd et al. 2011; Visser et al. 2004). However, limited natural history observations across many 
52 
species and vertebrate groups has stalled research that would help us better understand how 
53 
climate impacts various reproductive behaviors. Therefore, ideal model systems for learning 
54 
how climate affects reproductive behaviors and success include groups with abundant natural 
55 
history observations and whose reproduction is tied to particular environments.  
56 
Anurans (frogs and toads) are an ecologically and taxonomically diverse ectotherm 
57 
group (>7,400 species; AmphibiaWeb 2022) whose reproduction and development is generally 
58 
dependent on water availability during breeding. Their iconic calling behavior used for 
59 
reproduction has made them a prime target for natural history studies, making their reproductive 
60 
behaviors reasonably well-known. Anurans inhabit a wide array of habitats around the world

including tropical rainforests, arid deserts, temperate forests, freezing tundras, and more. These 
62 
habitats are used differently by various species which specialize in aquatic, terrestrial, fossorial 
63 
(underground), or arboreal (above ground) microhabitats (Moen & Wiens 2017). Studies of 
64 
amphibian reproduction and climate are dominated by advancements in our understanding of 
65 
reproductive modes (e.g., Gomez-Mestre et al. 2012) or reproductive timing (Beattie 1985; 
66 
Benard 2015; Neveu 2009; Reading 2003; Todd et al. 2011; While and Uller 2014). 
67 
Comparatively little is known about the relationship between climate and breeding period (sensu 
68 
Wells 1977), the duration of breeding within a population, which is unique from the duration of 
69 
breeding across populations of a single species. This is despite the stunning contrast of tropical 
70 
species that breed year-round to explosive-breeding species that limit reproduction to only a few 
71 
days or weeks of the year (Wells 1977). Common knowledge in herpetology says there exists a 
72 
latitudinal gradient in breeding periods, where tropical amphibians breed for generally longer 
73 
periods compared to temperate amphibians (Wells 2007). However, the precise role of climate 
74 
on breeding periods has yet to be identified across the phylogeny of anurans and further study 
75 
is necessary given widespread amphibian declines (Campbell Grant et al. 2020; Fisher and 
76 
Garner 2020). 
77 
If climate has an effect on breeding periods, we can expect physiology to play a central 
78 
role since frogs are especially sensitive to the environment as ectotherms and are reliant on 
79 
water for reproduction. Natural selection has likely led to physiological changes such that 
80 
populations maximize their reproductive investment leading to longer breeding periods in the 
81 
context of specific climate exposure or microhabitat use (Huey et al. 2012; Williams et al. 2008). 
82 
Thus, climate is tied to physiological and reproductive traits to the extent that individuals 
83 
experience changes in regional climate and atmospheric conditions during the breeding period 
84 
while in water or on land. These links have been shown previously, where body temperature is 
85 
correlated with substrate temperature and air temperature in the toad Bufo canorus 
86 
(Cunningham 1963). Both temperature and water are known breeding cues in frogs and warmer

temperatures likely lead to longer breeding periods due to greater food supply, reproductive 
88 
investment, and egg formation in frogs (Girish and Saidapur 2000; Lardner and Loman 2003; 
89 
Rastogi et al. 1983). Additionally, since reproduction in anurans is generally tied to water, we 
90 
can expect increased water availability to result in longer breeding periods. These abiotic 
91 
variables can also interact, as higher temperatures in drier environments may lead to increased 
92 
rates of water loss. From this perspective, larger-bodied species with lower surface area:volume 
93 
(SA:V) ratios may benefit from lower rates of water loss relative to smaller species. Alternatively, 
94 
larger-bodied species may be at a disadvantage in sub-optimal environments due to greater 
95 
resource demand and limited area for water or heat exchange. Species body size likely 
96 
influences the effect climate has on breeding period due to trade-offs between reproduction and 
97 
physiological performance over the course of the breeding period. Knowledge of how climate 
98 
and body size interact to influence anuran breeding periods is unknown but is likely to allow for 
99 
more targeted conservation efforts.  
100 
The goal of this study is to identify how ecological factors are related to reproduction 
101 
(breeding periods) in anurans on a global scale. Specifically, we test (H1) whether longer 
102 
breeding periods are the result of warmer, wetter climates, (H2) whether differences in body 
103 
size significantly alter the way climate influences breeding periods, (H3) whether species with 
104 
different non-breeding microhabitat preferences exhibit differences in breeding period, and (H4) 
105 
whether climate differs significantly between species microhabitat and geographical (temperate 
106 
and tropical) zones. Here, we provide the first quantitative assessment of the latitudinal gradient 
107 
of reproduction in anurans, including climatic and possible physiological drivers.

Material and Methods 
109 
Climate data 
110 
We obtained coordinate data for 497 species representing 41 of 54 anuran families from 
111 
GBIF.org (GBIF.org 2021a,b,c,d) accessed 3 October 2021. These queries were for presence 
112 
coordinate data for non-fossil native observations lacking geospatial issues. We cleaned the 
113 
data by removing coordinates points with >100km uncertainty or outside land boundaries of a 
114 
high resolution (1:10m) world countries map using the R v4.2.1 (R Core Team 2021) package 
115 
rworldxtra v1.01 (South 2012). We also removed coordinates incorrectly associated with and 
116 
within 100m of biodiversity collections outside of the natural range of the species. Additionally, 
117 
we removed Corythomantis greeningi since its coordinates mapped to a continent far outside its 
118 
natural range. We restricted data for the invasive Cane Toad (Rhinella marina) to its naturally 
119 
occurring range from southern United States to South America (AmphibiaWeb 2021). Next, we 
120 
removed species with less than 3 unique observations from the dataset and retained only 
121 
unique coordinates for each species to minimize the effects of spatial autocorrelation. Lastly, we 
122 
removed data outside the spatial 95% Confidence Interval for each species distribution with a 
123 
minimum of 30 occurrences using the median absolute deviation (mad) method (Huber 1981). 
124 
This resulted in a final coordinate dataset of 822,953 observations (mean = 1,656 observations 
125 
per species) after removing species without behavior or body size (see below) or missing from 
126 
the phylogeny of Jetz and Pyron (2018). Data cleaning was performed using the 
127 
CoordinateCleaner package v2.0-20 (Zizka et al. 2019).  
128 
We extracted seven variables from each coordinate using the WorldClim 2.1 (Fick & 
129 
Hijmans 2017) and envirem (Title & Bemmels 2018) databases at 30 seconds (~1km2) 
130 
resolution. Our data included variables affecting temperature and water availability and covering 
131 
all possible breeding period values (0–365 days). The final dataset included annual mean 
132 
temperature, temperature seasonality, annual precipitation, precipitation seasonality, annual

potential evapotranspiration (PET), PET seasonality, and topographic wetness. Topographic 
134 
wetness is the land’s ability to retain water obtained from estimates of upslope incurrent areas 
135 
and local slope, which is correlated to vascular plant species richness and soil moisture (see 
136 
Sørensen et al. 2005). We calculated species means for each climate variable to analyze the 
137 
dataset in a phylogenetic comparative framework. 
138 
Behavior data 
139 
We collected species means of breeding period (sensu Wells 1977) for each species in 
140 
this study. To obtain species means, we collected approximate start and end dates for breeding 
141 
periods from the primary literature or AmphibiaWeb (2022) and averaged all available breeding 
142 
period data for individual populations. We then calculated the difference in calendar days 
143 
between the start and end dates, assuming 365 calendar days. Since some dates were reported 
144 
as qualitative data (e.g., “May”, or “early May”), we ascribed values of either the first or last day 
145 
of the month when breeding periods were reported as starting or ending on a specific month 
146 
without a specific date given. When breeding periods were reported as the “early” or “late” parts 
147 
of a month, we matched this to the end of the 1st week and 3rd week, respectively. Rarely, 
148 
breeding periods were reported as specific seasons (e.g., “Summer” or “wet season”) and we 
149 
defined these as the number of days corresponding to each season and country. Populations 
150 
from species which are explosive breeders are typically associated with breeding periods lasting 
151 
only a few days to weeks, but never more than a month (Wells 1977). Since we never observed 
152 
published data reporting explosive breeding over a period longer than 2 weeks, we 
153 
conservatively assigned a period of 2 weeks to species whose only description of the breeding 
154 
period was “explosive breeding”.

Body size, habitat, and phylogenetic data 
156 
We collected maximum male body sizes (snout-vent length) and habitat data for every 
157 
species in this study from the primary literature and other datasets (AmphibiaWeb 2022; IUCN 
158 
2022; Moen and Wiens 2017; Womack and Bell 2020). Species were assigned to microhabitat 
159 
categories following Moen and Wiens (2017) and included: (1) aquatic, (2) arboreal, (3) 
160 
burrowing, (4) terrestrial, and (5) torrential. We also included partial categories such as: (6) 
161 
semi-arboreal, (7) semi-aquatic, and (8) semi-burrowing. Finally, we calculated phylogenetic 
162 
covariance matrices from the consensus tree of Jetz and Pyron (2018) to incorporate 
163 
evolutionary history as weights in phylogenetic regression. Additionally, we used 1,000 samples 
164 
from the pseudoposterior distribution of trees from Jetz and Pyron (2018) to assess models in 
165 
terms of phylogenetic uncertainty (see below). 
166 
Statistical analysis and visualization 
167 
 
All analyses were performed in R. We used ggtree v3.4.0 (Yu 2020; Yu et al. 2018; Yu et 
168 
al. 2017) to plot average species breeding periods and temperate-tropical geographical zones. 
169 
We analyzed the data using phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS; Grafen 1989; 
170 
Martins & Hansen 1997) implemented through RRPP v1.3.0 (Collyer and Adams 2018, 2019). 
171 
Notably, RRPP uses a residual randomized permutation procedure to fit models, evaluate 
172 
significance, and calculate effect sizes for model terms. We used 9,999 iterations for 
173 
significance testing in all models. We estimated phylogenetic covariance matrices using ape 
174 
v5.6-2 (Paradis & Schliep 2019).  
175 
We scaled each climate variable and performed a principal component analysis (PCA) to 
176 
avoid collinearity issues in our models. To test our hypotheses, we used phylogenetic multiple 
177 
regression to examine the relationship of breeding period, all 7 principal components (PCs), and 
178 
body size. To account for allometry of body size and since the natural logarithm of surface area-

to-volume ratio is expected to scale linearly with the natural logarithm of body size (Castro et al. 
180 
2021; Klein et al. 2016; Santini et al. 2018), we used the natural logarithm of body size in our 
181 
models. Additionally, we fit a phylogenetic ANCOVA model which included interactions between 
182 
each PC and body size. We also used ANOVA to test whether adding these interactions 
183 
resulted in a significant improvement in model performance. To aid in interpretation of these 
184 
models, we used phylogenetic regression to determine the relationship between breeding period 
185 
and each individual climate variable. We determined the effects of phylogenetic uncertainty in 
186 
our models by rerunning the ANCOVA model once each for 1,000 trees from the 
187 
pseudoposterior distribution of Jetz and Pyron (2018), following Baken et al. (2021). From these 
188 
analyses we obtained one distribution of 1,000 Z-scores per model term and visualized the 
189 
proportion of trees under which terms were not significant. We plotted these distributions using 
190 
ggridges v0.5.3 (Wilke 2021).  
191 
We used phylogenetic ANOVA to test whether breeding periods differ between 
192 
microhabitat categories, followed by evaluation of pairwise comparisons. We controlled for Type 
193 
I error rates due to multiple comparisons using the Sidak-like step-down procedure, which is 
194 
more powerful than the Sidak and Bonferroni methods (Holland & Copenhaver 1987), using 
195 
mutoss v0.1-12 (MuToss Coding Team et al. 2017). We used a phylogenetic factorial 
196 
MANCOVA to determine how climate (all 7 PC’s) differs among microhabitats and 
197 
temperate/tropical zones. Finally, we visualized these data by plotting conver hulls for groupings 
198 
of microhabitat and geographical zone using geomorph v4.0.4 (Adams et al. 2021; Baken et al. 
199 
2021b).

Results 
201 
Frog breeding periods follow a latitudinal gradient 
202 
We examined phylogenetic patterns of average breeding period (mean = 148 days, 
203 
range = 1–365 days, std. error = 4.5 days) and geographical zone (temperate/tropical) (Fig. 1) 
204 
and found species with longer breeding periods tend to live in tropical regions, whereas 
205 
temperate species breed for shorter periods. However, this pattern has several exceptions, such 
206 
as temperate species with long breeding periods and tropical species with very short breeding 
207 
periods. Overall, temperate species breed for an average of 127.8 days (median = 107 days, 
208 
range = 1–365 days, std. error = 5.87 days) and tropical species breed for an average of 167.3 
209 
days (median = 181 days, range = 5–365 days, std. error = 6.52 days). Climate principal 
210 
components (PCs) 1–3 explained 90% of data variance (Table 1; SI 1). We found variable 
211 
loadings for PC1 to be similar to known latitudinal climate differences and determined PC1 was 
212 
highly correlated (r = -0.94) with the absolute value of median latitude for each species (SI 1).  
213 
Climate and body size impact breeding periods 
214 
As body size can play a large role in thermal physiology and desiccation, we compared 
215 
model fits between two models with and without interactions between climate and body size 
216 
(snout-vent length). Indeed, including body size substantially improved model fit (F = 2.40, p = 
217 
0.0082; Table 2). Overall, this model explained 18% of variation in breeding periods.  
218 
We next describe this model in the context of phylogenetic uncertainty and given the 
219 
individual effects of each climate variable (see SI 1). We found larger species from the tropics 
220 
(high scores on PC1) tend to exhibit longer breeding periods relative to smaller species and the 
221 
magnitude of this effect can be up to 60-90 days. However, this pattern reverses in the 
222 
temperate zone where relatively smaller species exhibit longer breeding periods (Fig. 2A). For

example, Rana pretiosa (median latitude = 42.60) can be 14mm larger than Rana macrocnemis 
224 
(median latitude = 45.33) but exhibit a breeding period 48 days shorter (61-13=48 days). This 
225 
effect was due to latitudinal differences in temperature, temperature seasonality, precipitation, 
226 
and potential evapotranspiration (PET) seasonality, each showing similar effects when analyzed 
227 
individually (SI 1 Table 1). Since PET did not have a significant individual effect on breeding 
228 
periods, it likely does not affect breeding periods although it loads highly onto PC1; we do not 
229 
interpret PET further for any PC. The effect of PC1 was robust to phylogenetic uncertainty and 
230 
significant in 89.7% of surveyed trees while its combined effect with body size was supported in 
231 
64.2% of trees (Fig. 3). Independent of latitude (PC1), we found a significant impact of PC2 and 
232 
body size on breeding periods (Fig. 2B). Specifically, we found that relatively larger species 
233 
breed for longer periods in rainy environments with low topographic wetness (high values for 
234 
PC2) and smaller species breed for longer periods in environments with little rain but high 
235 
topographic wetness. Although topographic wetness had no individual effect on breeding 
236 
periods, it did exhibit a significant impact when paired with body size. This trend showed 
237 
moderate support across surveyed phylogenies with significance of PC2 and the interaction with 
238 
size supported in 0.714% and 0.704% of trees, respectively (Fig. 3). Additionally, we found 
239 
support for a size-independent role of PC3, where species living regions with low precipitation 
240 
seasonality (PC3) exhibit longer breeding periods (Fig. 2C). This pattern was significant in 
241 
87.9% of surveyed trees compared to only 31.4% of trees when taking size into account (Fig. 3). 
242 
Finally, we also found a size-independent effect of PC7 associated with warmer temperatures, 
243 
independent of temperature effects of other PC’s, where longer breeding periods are associated 
244 
with warmer temperatures. This pattern was supported in 66.9% of surveyed phylogenetic 
245 
histories.

Breeding periods are not different between microhabitats 
247 
The microhabitats species occupy can have different effects on breeding period 
248 
depending on differences in temperature and moisture within temperate or tropical regions. 
249 
Therefore, we tested whether anuran species with different microhabitat preferences exhibit 
250 
differences in breeding periods. We initially found support for this relationship, where species 
251 
from various microhabitats have different breeding periods (F = 4.09, p = 0.0062). However, 
252 
pairwise differences between microhabitats were not significant after accounting for multiple 
253 
comparisons (see SI 1 Table 2). In contrast to our expectation, we found large overlap in 
254 
breeding periods across microhabitat categories (Fig. 4A), including a wide breeding period 
255 
range associated with burrowing and semi-burrowing species. Semi-arboreal species had the 
256 
greatest proportion of species with a long breeding period. We next used a factorial MANCOVA 
257 
used examine climatic differences corresponding to combinations of microhabitat and 
258 
geographical zone (i.e., their interaction; F = 2.05, r2 = 0.02, Z = 2.27, p = 0.0124), but none of 
259 
these were significant after correcting for multiple comparisons (see SI 1 Table 3). Finally, we 
260 
found significant climate differences among microhabitats (F = 7.01, r2 = 0.08, Z = 3.77, p = 
261 
0.0001; Fig. 4B) and between temperate and tropical zones (F = 87.46, r2 = 0.14, Z = 8.93, p = 
262 
0.0001) but we did not find pairwise differences in the former after accounting for geographical 
263 
zone (see SI 1 Table 4).

Discussion 
265 
 
This study documents the evolution of reproductive behavior associated with climate in 
266 
one of the largest vertebrate groups. Here we present the first quantitative evidence, to our 
267 
knowledge, of the latitudinal gradient of breeding period in anurans and its relationship to 
268 
climate. Our overall findings support longer breeding periods where frogs invest more time into 
269 
reproduction in warmer and wetter habitats with little seasonality. We also discovered that the

time invested into reproduction, within the context of particular climates, is influenced by body 
271 
size. We discuss our results in the context of physiology and reproduction and suggest how this 
272 
new information can guide conservation management priorities of anurans in different climates.  
273 
Body size played an important role in determining how climate affects breeding periods. 
274 
This is likely due to its effect on physiological processes such as regulating body temperature 
275 
and water loss, where larger frogs are better at maintaining body temperatures and are slower 
276 
to dessicate (Castro et al. 2021; Klein et al. 2016; Santini et al. 2018; Tracy et al. 2010). The 
277 
size-dependent effect of climate on anuran reproduction is most notable when comparing 1) 
278 
temperate versus tropical environments, and 2) regions with high rainfall and limited propensity 
279 
to hold water versus regions with low rainfall and high topographic water retention. These 
280 
results are consistent with our hypothesis that larger body sizes are associated with greater 
281 
resource demands and limited area for water and heat exchange, resulting in shorter breeding 
282 
periods in environments with little rain, cooler temperatures, and low topographic water 
283 
retention. High temperature seasonality and high potential evapotranspiration seasonality also 
284 
seem to shorten breeding periods in larger species, possibly due to their combined effect and 
285 
this may be due to meeting physiological demands in relatively unpredictable environments. 
286 
Interestingly, environments which shorten breeding periods in larger species seem to be less 
287 
detrimental to smaller species, possibly due to their lower resource demand and relatively 
288 
greater area for water and heat exchange. Furthermore, larger-bodied species may be at a 
289 
disadvantage in cool and dry environments because the amount of energy used for maintaining 
290 
homeostasis (hydration) may limit the amount of reproductive investment females are able to 
291 
make, since egg formation is energetically costly for females. This seems likely, given that we 
292 
know larger frog species exhibit greater reproductive investment in the form of forming larger 
293 
clutches and larger eggs (Prado & Haddad 2005; Silva et al. 2020). Body size is also correlated 
294 
with reproductive investment in seasonally breeding endotherms like lagomorphs, whose body 
295 
size is correlated with neonatal mass, gestation time, and maternal reproductive effort (Swihart 
296

1984). Temperature and water preferences and limits can evolve in a correlated fashion (Bonetti 
297 
and Wiens 2014; Guevara-Molina et al. 2020; Köhler et al. 2011) and likely involve 
298 
underexplored molecular and morphological traits associated with the skin and body size in 
299 
amphibians (Finn et al. 2014; Shibata et al. 2014; Tracy et al. 2010). How temperature and 
300 
water limits have shaped anuran breeding physiology is unclear and is an area that needs more 
301 
research. 
302 
Ecology, in addition to physiology, plays an important role in determining breeding 
303 
periods. Our results suggest seasonal environments present the challenge of overcoming 
304 
unreliable cues for reproduction, similar to findings at shorter ecological scales (Todd et al. 
305 
2011). Here, we found size-dependent patterns, themselves independent of latitude, where 
306 
breeding periods in smaller species decline in rainier environments with lower topographic 
307 
wetness. These qualities are characteristic of high-altitude rainforests, or cloud forests, such as 
308 
those found in Central and South America, which hold much of the world’s anuran diversity 
309 
(Cortés et al. 2008; Duellman 1988; Giaretta et al. 1999). One explanation for this pattern is that 
310 
cloud forests exhibit relatively rapid local drainage of water resources necessary for prolonged 
311 
amphibian reproduction. Another possible explanation is that areas with low topographic 
312 
wetness and correspondingly low vascular plant species richness (Sørensen et al. 2005) 
313 
presents a challenge for prolonged breeding periods in smaller species by limiting protection 
314 
from canopy cover or reproductive opportunities associated with leaf- or phytotelma-breeding 
315 
species (Donnelly and Guyer 1994; Poelman et al. 2013; Schulte et al. 2010). Predation risk 
316 
may also differ between small and large species, where larger species are less reliant on 
317 
canopy cover due to their large size reducing predation pressure (Nakazawa et al. 2013), 
318 
resulting in longer breeding periods. Future research investigating the role of plant diversity and 
319 
predator-prey relationships in anurans seems likely to explain this variability in amphibian 
320 
reproduction.

Microhabitat use across and within species undoubtedly plays a critical role in how 
322 
animals experience broader regional climates and together they define climate exposure (Huey 
323 
et al. 2012; Williams et al. 2008). While ambient and body temperatures are connected 
324 
(Cunningham 1963), water stream and air temperatures are also correlated to atmospheric 
325 
temperatures in both warmer and colder climatic zones (Erickson and Stefan 1996; Mohseni 
326 
and Stefan 1999; Pilgrim et al. 1995). However, support for our hypothesis of differences in 
327 
breeding periods between species occupying different microhabitats was lacking. Instead, we 
328 
found a minority of burrowing species exhibit explosive breeding (extremely short breeding 
329 
periods) and an overabundance of semi-arboreal species which breed for longer periods. The 
330 
latter is likely related to radiations of small semi-arboreal frogs in the tropics of Central and 
331 
South America, one of the most diverse regions of the world. Perhaps unsurprisingly, we did not 
332 
find discernible climatic differences between microhabitats. This could reflect a low correlation 
333 
between regional climate and ambient conditions within microhabitats (e.g., a burrow). However, 
334 
such a strong role of microhabitat buffering seems unlikely if we expect, for example, 
335 
microhabitats within a temperate desert to resemble each other more closely than microhabitats 
336 
within a tropical rainforest. Instead, the lack of breeding period differences among microhabitats 
337 
most likely reflects the ecological breadth of frog communities and global convergent evolution 
338 
of microhabitat use across anurans (Moen et al. 2015). Further study of the relationships 
339 
between microhabitat, reproductive traits, and climate would likely result in additional model 
340 
improvements and better predictions of breeding period. For example, previous work found 
341 
decreased fecundity in anurans was associated with warmer winters within species (Benard 
342 
2015; Neveu 2009; Reading 2003) and warm, wet climates across terrestrial egg-laying species 
343 
(Gomez-Mestre et al. 2012). Notably, species in seasonal environments may have evolved 
344 
larger clutches in response to shorter breeding periods (Sheridan 2009). Future research will 
345 
continue to disentangle the relationships between behaviors, the environment, and further 
346 
investigate the role of life history in determining the effect of climate on reproductive ecology.

Unfortunately, we still know very little about the life histories of many frogs. A sustained push for 
348 
deeper understanding of life history diversity is necessary for identifying causal mechanisms 
349 
related to eco-evolutionary patterns.  
350 
Adaptation to changing climates is a key part of amphibian evolutionary history and 
351 
should be centered in future amphibian conservation efforts. Previous research has shown 
352 
conclusive evidence of adaptation to changing climates over ecological timescales (<40 yrs.; 
353 
Beattie 1985; Benard 2015; Freidenburg and Skelly 2004; Neveu 2009; Reading 2003; Skelly 
354 
and Freidenburg 2008; Skelly et al. 2007; Todd et al. 2011). This work, along with previous 
355 
studies on breeding start date (Beattie 1985; Ulloa et al. 2019; While and Uller 2014), identify 
356 
both water and temperature as important environmental cues for the start of the breeding 
357 
period. Associated neuroendocrine systems, thermal preferences, and critical thermal limits 
358 
seem to show flexibility in responding to changing climate, but this might change as the effects 
359 
of climate change become more severe. Huey et al. (2012) provide a model used to assess 
360 
extinction vulnerability over time, which can be affected by behavioral thermoregulation, 
361 
acclimation, and adaptation. Unfortunately, most anuran species live in warm, dry environments 
362 
and these same species exhibit narrow climatic niche breadths (Bonetti & Wiens 2014) which 
363 
can restrict dispersal (Chejanovski & Wiens 2014). The current study shows how species with 
364 
restricted breeding periods living in the cold, dry, and seasonal environments may be less 
365 
tolerant of climate change. Within the temperate zone, larger frogs with greater resource 
366 
demands may be particularly vulnerable, while smaller frogs are most vulnerable in the tropics. 
367 
Independent of latitude differences, we also found larger species may be vulnerable in areas 
368 
receiving little rain. Without physiological adaptation to climate change, frogs might mistime their 
369 
reproduction and be faced with either extinction, or potentially speciation through temporal 
370 
isolation of reproduction. This might be one of the possible mechanisms linking diversification 
371 
rates and rates of climatic niche change in anurans (Moen & Wiens 2017).

Amphibians are facing unprecedented threats due to climate change from the lens of 
373 
eco-physiology. Notably, climate change seems to amplify the current amphibian chytrid fungus 
374 
epidemic due to size-related osmoregulatory costs (Wu et al. 2018). Given the several factors 
375 
contributing to growing extinction risks faced by frogs and toads, an attempt to maintain 
376 
reproductive fitness by maximizing breeding duration seems critical. Overall, our research 
377 
suggests a regional-based approach toward conserving species’ flexibility in the timing and 
378 
period of breeding. There are multiple factors impacting amphibian breeding periods but 
379 
regional climate has a noticeable average effect on breeding periods worldwide. Extinction risks 
380 
due to the mistiming of reproduction or shortened breeding periods might be highest in smaller 
381 
tropical species which are common in tropical lowlands. Species living in tropical lowlands along 
382 
with those living in cloud forests have both been identified as being under threat of extinction 
383 
(von May et al. 2019; Meza-Parral and Pineda 2015; Murrieta-Galindo et al. 2013; Ponce-Reyes 
384 
et al. 2013). Further research is needed to understand the neuroendocrine cues used for timing 
385 
reproduction in frogs, thermal preferences, and the role of molecular or morphological 
386 
adaptations related to water and heat stress. Without this research, future temperature 
387 
instability will increase extinction risk without either dispersal to suitable habitats or the ability to 
388 
acclimate and adapt to their changing environment (Huey et al. 2012). Perhaps the existence of 
389 
tropical explosive breeders shows capacity for adaptation and persistence in the face of climate 
390 
change. For example, species faced with limited breeding periods may also adapt to produce 
391 
more eggs (Sheridan 2009) and habitat shifts associated with thermal preference and choosing 
392 
egg-laying sites may help mitigate negative thermal climatic effects on tadpoles (Pintanel et al. 
393 
2022; Todd et al. 2011). Amphibians have much to benefit from dedicated conservation efforts 
394 
to protect large and diverse landscapes allowing dispersal, protecting plant diversity, and 
395 
preserving a thermally-diverse range of habitat options. Similar efforts have been successful in 
396 
partially restoring amphibian diversity in cloud forests (Díaz-García et al. 2020). Future research
