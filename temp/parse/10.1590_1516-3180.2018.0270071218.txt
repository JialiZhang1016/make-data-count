INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is considered to be the third most commonly diagnosed and the sec-
ond greatest cause of mortality due to cancer in North America.1 In Brazil, similar data have 
been reported from research carried out by the National Cancer Institute (Instituto Nacional 
do Câncer, INCA). In 2018, the estimate incidence of CRC was 36,360 new cases (17,380 men 
and 18,980 women), with the highest incidence in the age group between 50 and 70 years.2 
Approximately one in three people who develop the disease die of it.3 
The most significant independent prognostic factor for CRC is the tumor-node-metastasis 
(TNM) stage and the “potential” residual disease after surgery.4 Neoplastic recurrence is a fre-
quent cause of death among patients undergoing primary disease resection with curative intent,5,6 
and this is one of the reasons for conducting further studies on CRC prognosis. 
The p53 tumor suppressor gene acts as a damage sensor in relation to deoxyribonucleic acid 
(DNA) and assists in the repair system using checkpoints to halt the cell cycle or induce apop-
tosis, thus preventing cell proliferation.7 In p53-mutation cells there is no DNA repair in the cell 
cycle.8 These genetically unstable cells tend to accumulate mutations, thereby leading to rapid 
proliferation of cell clones with mutated DNA, and thus to neoplastic transformation.9 
Some authors agree that overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) 
is ­associated with lower survival rates and worse prognosis.10 EGFRs are tyrosine kinase 
receptors that are involved in cascade-like activation, which leads to cell differentiation 
and multiplication.11

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: There are cases of colorectal tumors that, although small, show more aggressive evo-
lution than large tumors. This motivated us to study whether there are any proteins capable of alerting 
about these changes. The aim here was to correlate the immunoexpression of the TS, p53, COX2, EGFR, 
MSH6 and MLH1 biomarkers in tumors in patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma, with the degree of cell 
differentiation, tumor staging and clinical-pathological prognostic factors. 
DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective observational study at a public tertiary-level hospital.
METHODS: We analyzed tissue-microarray paraffin blocks of tumor tissues that had been resected from 
107 patients. We used Fisher’s exact test to study associations between tumor differentiation/staging and 
the immunoexpression of biomarkers. We also used Kaplan-Meier estimation, the log-rank test and the 
adjusted Cox regression model to investigate the patients’ overall survival (in months) according to bio-
markers and disease-free interval. 
RESULTS: The degree of tumor differentiation and tumor staging were not associated with the biomark-
ers, except in cases of patients in stages III or IV, in which there was a correlation with MLH1 expression 
(P = 0.021). Patient survival and disease-free interval were not associated with the biomarkers. 
CONCLUSION: There were no associations between the degree of tumor differentiation, staging, length 
of survival or disease-free interval and the immunoexpression of the TS, p53, COX2, EGFR or MSH6 tumor 
markers. In advanced cases of colorectal adenocarcinoma (stages III and IV), there was a higher percentage 
of MLH1-negative results.

The cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme plays a key role in 
conversion of arachidonic acid (AA) into prostaglandins, which 
have been associated with colorectal carcinogenesis.12 No conclu-
sions have yet been reached regarding the relationship between 
COX-2 expression and patient survival.13 
The major repair genes, i.e. MutS-homolog1 (MLH1), 
MutS‑homolog6 (MSH6), MutS-homolog2 (MSH2), postmei-
otic segregation increased 1 (PMS1) and postmeiotic segregation 
increased 2 (PMS2), play important roles in correcting mutations 
associated with oxidative stress. It is important to correct for addi-
tion of CH3 radicals to DNA bases.14-16 It has been shown that 
oxidative stress caused by oxygen free radicals breaks single and 
double DNA strands, thus inducing errors in the nitrogenous base 
pairs, which may lead to genetic mutations.17,18 Cells have defense 
mechanisms against these errors, consisting of DNA repair systems 
(i.e. mismatch repair, MMR).16 Deficiencies in this DNA repair 
mechanism constitute an important molecular pathway for CRC 
development, which occurs in the cases of approximately 15% of 
colorectal neoplasms.19 
OBJECTIVE 
To study the immunoexpression of the TS, p53, COX2, EGFR, 
MSH6 and MLH1 biomarkers in patients with colorectal carci-
noma; and to make correlations with the degree of cell differenti-
ation, tumor staging and clinical-pathological prognostic factors.
METHODS 
Study design, setting and ethics
We used tissues from patients who were operated at the Muriaé 
Cancer Hospital (Hospital do Câncer de Muriaé, HCM), in 
Muriaé, Minas Gerais, Brazil. We submitted the study protocol 
to the Ethics Committee of HCM and to the “Platform Brazil” 
Research Ethics Council (approval protocol number 347.449). 
Samples, participants and surgical procedures
We analyzed the tissue samples of a convenience sample of all 
consecutive patients with colonic or rectal cancer who under-
went operations between January 2003 and November 2008 and 
whose paraffin blocks were stored at the archives of the HCM 
Department of Pathology. 
The inclusion criteria for these patients were that they under-
went surgical resection of the colon or rectum due to adenocarci-
noma, without presence of any other severe chronic degenerative 
diseases that would impair survival assessment, and with subse-
quent follow-up at the outpatient clinic. The following patients were 
excluded: those with past neoplasms, those who underwent palli-
ative surgery and those who died in the immediate postoperative 
period. Our final sample comprised 107 specimens. We obtained 
data from the patients’ medical records and we tried to reach 
patients through phone calls, calling them for follow-up visits, so 
that there would not be any lack of information in the records. 
Patients who underwent elective surgery had been staged 
preoperatively, and all of these patients were operated by a single 
team, with postoperative follow-up performed in the outpatient 
ward. Colorectal carcinoma was diagnosed by means of anorectal 
examination and tests such as flexible sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy 
and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan. 
Among cases of emergency surgery performed because of 
acute intestinal obstruction, the diagnosis was made by means of 
clinical examination, abdominal x-ray and CT scan, and laparot-
omy. Among the elective patients, the diagnosis and preoperative 
staging were done using the following: a) clinical examination; 
b) ancillary tests, i.e. measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen 
(CEA), colonoscopy, chest radiography, abdominal and pelvic CT 
scans and abdominal ultrasonography; c) colorectal tumor biopsy; 
d) biopsy of the metastatic lesion, when suspected; and e) pathol-
ogy examination on the surgical specimen. 
Colonic or colorectal resection surgery was performed after 
checking for neoplastic spread into other organs and for any struc-
tures affected by the tumor. The surgery potentially included 
regional lymphadenectomy, respecting the tumor resection crite-
ria. The patients were postoperatively followed up early on, with 
periodic clinical evaluations and with laboratory (CEA), radio-
logical and endoscopic procedures, to check for any early disease 
recurrence. 
Tissue microarray analysis
We used tissue microarrays (TMAs) to study the immunoex-
pression of TS protein, p53, COX2, EGFR, MSH6 and MLH1. 
The colorectal cancer tissues obtained from biopsies or surgi-
cal specimens were fixed in 10% formalin and were processed 
using the paraffin embedding method for histological analysis. 
Histological sections of thickness 3 mm were obtained from 
each block. The sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin 
and were reviewed by two pathologists to confirm the diagno-
sis and reassess the histopathological findings. These evalua-
tions helped select the parts of the specimens from which the 
cylinders of tissue used in the TMAs were taken. The TMA 
slides were subjected to five immunohistochemical reactions, 
following the specifications of the primary antibodies used for 
each biomarker. 
The TMA methodology was as follows:
1.	 The area selected was marked out in the respective paraffin block; 
2.	 A drained space (“casela”) was created in the recipient block; 
3.	 A tissue cylinder of 1 mm in diameter was extracted from the 
donor block of the respective area of interest that had previ-
ously been selected;

4.	 The tissue cylinder thus obtained was transferred from the 
donor block to the “casela” that had previously been created 
in the recipient block; 
5.	 New positions within the recipient block were progressively 
reached (through movement measured in fractions of milli-
meters), in order to create a collection of tissue samples, fol-
lowing a matrix arrangement; 
6.	 Final block quality was assessed for storage purposes.
Variables studied 
We investigated the immunoexpression of the following variables, 
and described patients according to them: TS protein, p53, COX2, 
EGFR, MSH6 and MLH1; along with the degree of tumor differ-
entiation, tumor staging, overall survival and disease-free interval. 
Surgery was registered as curative (radical) or palliative, accord-
ing to whether residual macroscopic neoplastic lesions were found 
to exist postoperatively in staging tests and according to the results 
from histopathological examination of the surgical specimen. 
Curative procedures require radical excision of the tumor with 
adequate surgical margins, considering its vascular pedicle and the 
largest number of adjacent lymph nodes, with no positive margins 
seen in pathological evaluation. Palliative surgery involves incom-
plete tumor resection, tumor bypass or just making a stoma with-
out resecting the tumor. 
Recurrence was defined as tumor recurrence in local structures 
or in remote organs as metastases that originated from the colorectal 
tumor. Recurrence was confirmed based on clinical examination, 
laboratory tests, radiological imaging and/or endoscopic views. 
The disease-free interval was considered to be the period of 
postoperative time within which there was no detection of can-
cer recurrence in patients who underwent a supposedly curative 
procedure. Survival was defined as the time interval between sur-
gery and death for certain patients, or between surgery and the 
last visit to the clinic or telephone contact. The staging of lesions 
was carried out in accordance with the tumor, node and metasta-
sis (TNM) classification system. 
Statistical analysis 
The statistical analysis was performed by an independent 
researcher. The data of interest were collected from the patients’ 
records. The statistical analysis on all the data collected in this 
study was done descriptively. 
For the quantitative variables (numerical variables), we calcu-
lated some summary measurements, such as average, minimum, 
maximum and standard deviation values. The qualitative variables 
(categorized variables) were analyzed by calculating the absolute 
and relative frequencies (percentages).20 We performed inferen-
tial analyses to confirm or refute evidence that was found in the 
descriptive analysis, consisting of an extension of the Fisher exact 
test21 to study associations between the degree of tumor differen-
tiation and the immunoexpression of TS, COX2, EGFR, MLH1, 
MSH6 and p53; and between tumor staging and the immunoex-
pression of TS, COX2, EGFR, MLH1, MSH6 and p53. 
Kaplan-Meier estimates,22 the log-rank test23 and the adjusted 
Cox regression model were used to investigate the individuals’ 
overall survival (in months) according to their immunoexpression 
of TS, COX2, EGFR, MSH6, MLH1 and p53; and the disease-free 
interval of six subjects (in months) according to their immunoex-
pression of TS, COX2, EGFR, MSH6, MLH1 and p53. 
For inferential analysis purposes, we used the significance level 
α = 5%. We stored the data in Excel for Windows 2007 spread-
sheets. For statistical analyses, we use the R statistical software, 
version 2.10.1.
RESULTS 
Our sample involved 107 individuals, comprising 50 females 
(46.7%) and 57 males (53.3%). The women’s average age was 
64.3 years, ranging from 43 to 90 years, with a standard deviation 
of 11.7 years. The male group had a mean age of 57.2 years, rang-
ing from 24 to 86 years, with a standard deviation of 16.8 years. 
The inferential results regarding the association between the 
degree of tumor differentiation and the immunoexpression of TS, 
COX2, EGFR, MLH1, MSH6 and p53 showed that the degree of 
tumor differentiation was not associated with the immunoexpres-
sion of TS (P = 0.138), COX2 (P = 0.428), EGFR (P = 0.103), MSH6 
(P = 0.876), MLH1 (P = 0.792) or p53 (P = 0.884). 
Subject clinical stage (CS)  
distribution according to TS expression
There was no statistically significant difference in the clinical 
staging of individuals, in relation to TS expression (P = 0.817). 
Similarly, there was no statistically significant difference in stag-
ing, in relation to the immunoexpression of COX2 (P = 0.842), 
EGFR (P = 0.344), MSH6 (P = 0.923), MLH1 (P = 0.021) or p53 
(P = 0.666) (Table 1). 
Clinical stage distribution of the  
subjects according to MLH1 expression
We found an association between stage and MLH1, such that the 
group of individuals in stages III or IV had a higher percentage of 
MLH1-negative results (28.3%) than did the subjects in stages 0, 
I or II (3.7%) (P = 0.021) (Table 1).
The inferential results from univariate analysis (log-rank test) 
revealed that overall survival was not associated with the immuno-
expression of TS (P = 0.480), COX2 (P = 0.998), EGFR (P = 0.600), 
MSH6 (P = 0.318), MLH1 (P = 0.798) or p53 (P = 0.695) (Table 2). 
Even after disregarding the subjects with results that were clas-
sified as inconclusive, we were able to confirm that survival was

Table 2. Summary of the overall survival time (months) 
among the individuals with colorectal cancer, according to 
immunoexpression of MLH1
not associated with the immunoexpression of TS (P = 0.502), 
COX2 (P = 0.989), EGFR (P = 0.424), MSH6 (P = 0.129), MLH1 
(P = 0.496) or p53 (P = 0.979).
The inferential results from univariate analysis (log-rank test) 
revealed that the subjects’ disease-free interval did not correlate 
with their immunoexpression of TS (P = 0.356), COX2 (P = 0.885), 
EGFR (P = 0.786), MSH6 (P = 0.178), MLH1 (P = 0.691) or p53 
(P = 0.441). Even after disregarding the individuals with inconclu-
sive results, we were able to confirm that the disease-free interval 
was not associated with the immunoexpression of TS (P = 0.228), 
COX2 (P = 0.796), EGFR (P = 0.661), MSH6 (P = 0.071), MLH1 
(P = 0.448) or p53 (P = 0.442). 
It was noteworthy that there was a tendency for MSH6-positive 
individuals to have longer disease-free intervals than those of their 
MSH6-negative counterparts. 
We used the statistical methodology of the multiple Cox regres-
sion model to confirm the findings obtained from univariate anal-
ysis (log-rank test). The multivariate analysis confirmed the evi-
dence obtained in the univariate analyses, in which individuals’

length of survival was not associated with their immunoexpression 
of TS (P = 0.794), COX2 (P = 0.885), EGFR (P = 0.882), MSH6 
(P = 0.142), MLH1 (P = 0.788) or p53 (P = 0.556). Moreover, the 
subjects’ disease-free interval was not associated with their immu-
noexpression of TS (P = 0.481), COX2 (P = 0.756), EGFR (P = 
0.843), MSH6 (P = 0.085), MLH1 (P = 0.464) or p53 (P = 0.164). 
It is important to highlight that, to achieve Cox regression 
analysis of greater stability, we disregarded the individuals with 
results that were deemed inconclusive. 
DISCUSSION
To explain our f﻿indings, one theory might be that the specimens 
contained in the paraffin blocks did not represent the invasive 
tumor. It is becoming increasingly common in the literature to 
see reports of different expressions of tumor markers in the same 
surgical specimen. It is important to remember that advanced 
tumors are almost always heterogeneous in nature (i.e. with ran-
domly distributed tissues), and of variable sizes (such that large 
masses tend to more intensely express antigenic reactions). 
These properties can lead to cells of different degrees of differ-
entiation within the same lesion, which can greatly influence 
immunoreactivity. Considering this theory, one solution might 
be to perform immunohistochemical examinations on tumor tis-
sue by means of microarrays, as performed in this study.
Another possible way to explain our findings is to suggest 
that there might be an association with the type of antibody used. 
Monoclonal antibody sensitivities may differ, depending on the 
type used: some might react better with the basal membranes of 
epithelial tissues, and others with the cell cytoplasm. 
A further way to explain our findings concerning the immu-
nohistochemical tests relates to the issue of statistical power, i.e. 
whether the sample has the power to demonstrate a significant 
difference when this exists. It is possible that larger samples, with 
consequently higher statistical power, could overcome this poten-
tial shortcoming. This, however, is only a hypothesis. 
Conflicting results regarding the TS, p53, COX2, EGFR, 
MSH6 and MLH1 immune markers in CRC have been reported, 
and these can be explained by the different numbers of samples, 
the techniques used and the wide variation in methodologies 
used in the various studies. Patient selection, tissue processing, 
immunohistochemical techniques, result interpretations and sta-
tistical analyses have been quite variable.24 For these reasons, we 
were led to study the association between the immunoreactivity 
of the tumor markers TS, p53, COX2, EGFR, MSH6 and MLH1 
in cases of colorectal cancer and the main clinical and patho-
logical prognostic factors. These factors comprise recurrence, 
disease-free interval, survival, cell differentiation and staging. 
However, separate analysis on these markers showed that there 
were no associations with these prognostic factors, except in the 
group of patients at stages III or IV, in which there was a higher 
percentage of MLH1‑negative individuals (28.3%) than in the 
group of individuals at stages 0, I or II (2.3%).
Recent studies have demonstrated that silencing of the 
MLH1 gene is related to development of errors associated with 
replication of CRC cells, as was depicted in a study on micro-
satellite instability.25 It was also found that MLH1 repair gene 
expression is higher in normal tissue than in cancer tissue, 
which demonstrated the importance of this gene in maintain-
ing DNA integrity.24,26
CONCLUSION 
TS, COX2, EGFR, MSH6, MLH1 and p53 expression, as mea-
sured through immunohistochemical analysis, was not associated 
with the clinical-pathological factors of the patients with colorec-
tal adenocarcinoma studied, except for MLH1 in some cases. This 
marker showed a significant difference in expression between 
patients at stages III and IV and those at stages I to IV of colorec-
tal adenocarcinoma.
