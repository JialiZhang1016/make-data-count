Abstract
Conservation assessments of hyperdiverse groups of organisms are often challenging and
limited by the availability of occurrence data needed to calculate assessment metrics such
as extent of occurrence (EOO). Spiders represent one such diverse group and have
historically been assessed using primary literature with retrospective georeferencing. Here
we demonstrate the differences in estimations of EOO and hypothetical IUCN Red List
classifications for two extensive spider datasets comprising 479 species in total. The EOO
were estimated and compared using literature-based assessments, Global Biodiversity
Information  Facility  (GBIF)-based  assessments  and  combined  data  assessments.  We
found that although few changes to hypothetical IUCN Red List classifications occurred
with the addition of  GBIF  data,  some  species  (3.3%)  which  could  previously  not  be
classified  could  now  be  assessed  with  the  addition  of  GBIF  data.  In  addition,  the
hypothetical classification changed for others (1.5%). On the other hand, GBIF data alone
did not provide enough data for 88.7% of species. These results demonstrate the potential
of GBIF data to serve as an additional source of information for conservation assessments,

Introduction
The mobilisation of biodiversity data through aggregating platforms such as the Global
Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) has generated excitement about the potential for
applying such publicly available data towards filling gaps in biological knowledge (Edwards
2004).  To  this  end,  the  ability  to  predict  species  distributions  more  accurately  using
aggregated  occurrence  data  may  have  broad  implications  for  land  management,
environmental policy, ecosystem monitoring and conservation. Examples of such potential
include the utilisation of GBIF occurrence data towards prioritising areas and species for
conservation purposes (Alburquerque and Beier 2016, Miličić et al. 2017).
For many taxa, conservation assessments are conducted through the International Union
for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) Red List framework, which provides information about
species threat levels. The Red List also aims to monitor global trends in biodiversity and
inform policy-makers on the conservation of nature (IUCN 2012). Given the scarcity of data
on population numbers and trends for megadiverse taxa, these assessments are mostly
based on the geographical range of a taxon and how that range has changed over time.
Thus, a comprehensive, or at least representative, set of georeferenced occurrence data is
needed to assess the potential threat to a species.
Araneae represent one group of largely understudied and under-sampled organisms, still
lagging other taxa in terms of representative data in GBIF (Troudet et al. 2017). In addition
to this lack of occurrence data, additional knowledge gaps in the ability to conserve spiders
and other arthropods are apparent, including taxon-specific deficiencies in ecological and
biogeographic knowledge (Cardoso et al. 2011). With acknowledgement of this deficiency
in  spider  data,  assessing  the  utility  of  our  current  knowledge  base  is  essential  for
promoting further digitisation and discovery of species, their natural history and eventual
conservation. In this study, we aim to test the utility of current GBIF occurrence data in the
extinction risk assessment of spiders using two large-scale assessments as examples.
Material and methods
Two extensive datasets were used to assess the applicability of GBIF occurrence data in
threat assessments. The first consists of a random selection of 200 species from the World
Spider Catalog (Natural History Museum Bern 2017), a global database of all recognised
species names for spiders. These were chosen for another study concerning a baseline
spider Sampled Red List Index - SRLI (Seppälä et al. 2018a, Seppälä et al. 2018b,
2
Shirey V et al
Seppälä et al. 2018c, Seppälä et al. 2018d). The SRLI is a methodological approach to
quantify global trends towards extinction of speciose taxa (Baillie et al. 2008, Lewis and
Senior 2011) and these data will contribute to its inception for spiders. Occurrence data for
these 200 species were collected from the taxonomic bibliography available at the same
database until the end of 2017. Data from publications found on Google Scholar and
several other online sources were also included in this dataset and detailed in Cardoso et
al. (2019). The use of literature as the baseline for these assessments follows established
IUCN procedures for Red List methodologies (IUCN 2012).
The second dataset was compiled for all 279 endemic spider species of the Iberian
Peninsula (Continental Portugal, Spain, Andorra and Gibraltar, plus the Balearic Islands),
collected from a bibliographic database on species occurrences in the region (Branco et al.
2019). This database includes all published citations until the end of 2018.
Geographic  coordinates  were  obtained  for  each  locality  across  both  datasets  using
literature  sources  and  georeferenced  locality  data.  To  these  data,  we  added  all
georeferenced records from GBIF of the same 200 (see original data references to GBIF in
Seppälä et al. 2018a, Seppälä et al. 2018b, Seppälä et al. 2018c, Seppälä et al. 2018d)
plus  279  species  (GBIF.org  2019).  Non-georeferenced  data  were  removed  from  the
analysis as they cannot be utilised in our spatial metric calculation, species lacking any
georeferenced data being designated as Data Deficient (DD). Our goal was to use GBIF
data  without  any  further  modification  and/or  annotation  and,  therefore,  we  did  not
georeference records lacking coordinates. Coordinates obtained from GBIF were reviewed
alongside  known  species  distributions  to  determine  if  dubious  localities  existed  (e.g.
records of Iberian endemics occurring outside of their known ranges). We found no records
that warranted deletion from dubious localities.
Our analysis consisted of comparing IUCN classifications assigned to each species by
using the GBIF, literature and combined literature and GBIF datasets in an Extent of
Occurrence (EOO) calculation. EOO is defined as the area contained within the shortest
continuous imaginary boundary that can be drawn to encompass all records (IUCN 2012).
Note that to build a minimum convex polygon, at least three data points are needed,
otherwise the species was classified as Data Deficient. Particular EOO thresholds must be
met in order for a species to be considered Critically Endangered (CR, < 100 km ),
Endangered (EN, < 5,000 km ), Vulnerable (VU, < 20,000 km ) or Near Threatened (NT, <
30,000 km ). Species  with  no  calculated  area  are  classified  as  Data  Deficient  (DD).
Although other criteria must be met for a full IUCN assessment, we did not consider them
here in the context of spatial occurrence data. EOO was calculated by using the R-
package “red” (v.1.4.0) (Cardoso 2018) in R version 3.6.0 (R Core Team 2019).
R  scripts  used  for  data  retrieval  and  processing  are  available  on  GitHub  (https://
github.com/vmshirey/spiders) where the dated version of this repository that corresponds
to this publication is December 2019. The literature datasets were contributed to GBIF and
consisted of 2,378 records for the global list and 30,141 records for all the Iberian taxa
(Cezón and Cardoso 2019, Cardoso et al. 2019).

Results
Global Spider Taxa 
Using GBIF data alone, 17.5% of species from our global taxon list could be classified into
a hypothetical IUCN category. A total of 40.0% could be classified using literature data
alone and 45.5% could be classified using the combined GBIF and literature datasets
(Table 1). With the addition of GBIF data to the literature dataset, 6.5% of species shifted
their classification. A few species, in particular, suffered considerable downgrades in their
hypothetical classification, namely Myrmarachne bicolor (L. Koch, 1879) (VU to LC). This
change was due to an addition of 16 GBIF records to the literature dataset of 7 records.

Iberian Endemic Spider Taxa 
Using  GBIF  data  alone,  6.8%  of  Iberian  endemic  species  could be  classified  into  a
hypothetical IUCN category. A total of 58.1% could be classified using literature data alone
and 59.9% could be classified using the combined GBIF and literature datasets (Table 2).
With  the  addition  of  GBIF  data  to  the  literature  dataset,  4.7%  of  records  shifted
classification.  A  few  species,  in  particular,  suffered  considerable  downgrades  in  their
hypothetical classification, including Micrommata aragonensis Urones, 2004 and M. aljibica
Urones, 2004 (both EN to LC). These changes were due to the addition of 1 and 2 GBIF
records to the literature dataset of 3 and 4 records, respectively.
Overall Summary 
Overall, we found that, although few changes to hypothetical IUCN Red List classifications
occurred with the addition of GBIF data, some species (3.3%), which could previously not
be classified, could now be assessed with the addition of GBIF data. In addition, the
hypothetical classification changed for others (1.5%). On the other hand, GBIF data alone
did not provide enough data for 88.7% of species.

Discussion
The status of current GBIF data for extinction risk assessment of spiders shows both
promise and limitations. These results largely fall in line with prior exploration of GBIF data
in species conservation assessments, including the need for experts in taxonomy to review
the  validity  of  records  and  taxonomic  determinations  (Hjarding  et  al.  2014).  Recent
analyses of museum datasets have suggested that researchers take a critical lens to using
museum occurrence data, as taxonomic misidentification and spatial biases are known to
occur  (Nekola  et  al.  2019).  In  addition,  particular  research  disciplines  may  focus  on
collecting and digitising specimens related to taxonomic work that could influence over-
and  undersampling  of  particular  species.  These  pitfalls  are  difficult  to  mitigate  when
utilising online data without validation of species taxonomy or correct label transcriptions.
Thus, results presented using such data (and in particular, results in which a few records
drastically change results) should not be taken as absolute fact. Yet, in a few cases, GBIF
data might contribute more records without expanding species occurrence ranges if the
new records fall inside the polygon encompassed by the old ones (Beck et al. 2013).
Despite this, promising results in our study include the change of hypothetical EOO-based
classification amongst species listed as threatened across both species lists. Moreover,
any change of risk assessment classifications from Data Deficient (DD) is notable. These
changes provide initial assessments to previously DD taxa, which may add up to very large
proportions of assessments on many hyperdiverse groups, including spiders (Seppälä et
al. 2018d). Additionally, other researchers have focused on using GBIF data to partly
automate the process of Red Listing, including the calculation of spatial metrics (Bachman
et al. 2011, https://spbachman.shinyapps.io/rapidLC/).
Although such advancements should be noted, it is worth realising that just 6.5% and 4.7%
of the taxa in the global and Iberian datasets, respectively, change their hypothetical IUCN
classifications. The low rates of observed classification shift could be an artifact of the
aforementioned data pitfalls for spiders in GBIF, which strengthens the argument for more

collection, observation and/or digitisation of data. Retrospective georeferencing of locality
data  within  GBIF  will  also  serve  to  further  enhance these  metrics.  Currently  (as  of
December 2019), 93% of GBIF records are georeferenced; however, coordinates are less
often available for certain groups, such as Araneae (88%).
Despite current limitations, we believe that there is potential for the use of GBIF occurrence
data in Red List assessments. Additional data sourced from GBIF will help refine IUCN
spatial metrics, in particular EOO, even when considering the currently identified pitfalls of
GBIF data. While these metrics should, in general, not be calculated with GBIF data alone,
it is important to consider GBIF as a source of additional information. Moreover, the
addition of more data from collections and community-based observations improves the
potential applicability of GBIF data in Red List classification assessments.
