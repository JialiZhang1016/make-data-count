Members of the gammaproteobacterial clade SUP05 couple water column sulﬁde oxidation
to nitrate reduction in sulﬁdic oxygen minimum zones (OMZs). Their abundance in offshore
OMZ waters devoid of detectable sulﬁde has led to the suggestion that local sulfate reduction
fuels SUP05-mediated sulﬁde oxidation in a so-called “cryptic sulfur cycle”. We examined the
distribution and metabolic capacity of SUP05 in Peru Upwelling waters, using a combination
of
oceanographic,
molecular,
biogeochemical
and
single-cell
techniques.
A
single
SUP05 species, UThioglobus perditus, was found to be abundant and active in both sulﬁdic
shelf and sulﬁde-free offshore OMZ waters. Our combined data indicated that mesoscale
eddy-driven transport led to the dispersal of UT. perditus and elemental sulfur from the sulﬁdic
shelf waters into the offshore OMZ region. This offshore transport of shelf waters provides an
alternative explanation for the abundance and activity of sulﬁde-oxidizing denitrifying bac-
teria in sulﬁde-poor offshore OMZ waters.

O
xygen minimum zones (OMZs), where dissolved oxygen
concentrations fall below 20 µmol kg−1, are responsible
for large losses of ﬁxed nitrogen from the ocean, despite
occupying <1% of the global ocean volume1–3. High rates of
primary productivity coupled to poor ventilation cause the
development of OMZs and can lead to the recurrent accumula-
tion of dissolved hydrogen sulﬁde in OMZ shelf waters off Peru,
Namibia, and India4–7. Such sulﬁdic events often generate epi-
sodic plumes of particulate elemental sulfur in surface waters that
are visible from space6, 8–10. Closely associated with these sulﬁdic
events are bacteria from the gammaproteobacterial clade known
as SUP055, 6, 11, 12. As a nitrate-reducing, sulﬁde-oxidizing che-
molithoautotroph, the SUP05 clade encompasses organisms with
the physiological capabilities necessary to contribute to the loss of
ﬁxed N from productive upwelling regions, the production of
climate relevant N2O, and dark carbon ﬁxation in the sub-
euphotic water column5, 6, 11–13. The extent to which SUP05
organisms are active and directly contribute to dark carbon
ﬁxation, sulﬁde oxidation, and ﬁxed nitrogen loss has not been
quantiﬁed thus far.
Gene sequences associated with the SUP05 clade, moreover, are
frequently found not only in sulﬁdic shelf waters5, 6, but in OMZ
waters on the outer shelf and offshore OMZ waters where dis-
solved hydrogen sulﬁde concentrations fall below typical detec-
tion levels (<1 µM)14–18. Offshore OMZs also harbor diverse
assemblages of putative sulfate-reducing bacteria13, 15–17, and it
has been proposed that SUP05 and sulfate-reducing bacteria may
be involved in a “cryptic sulfur cycle”13. In this case, cryptic sulfur
cycling refers to the simultaneous activity of sulfate-reducing and
sulﬁde-oxidizing pathways in a closely deﬁned space such as a
marine particle aggregate. Locally produced sulﬁde from sulfate-
reducing bacteria is immediately oxidized back to elemental sul-
fur or sulfate by sulﬁde-oxidizing bacteria and dissolved sulﬁde
remains
at
sub-micromolar
concentrations13.
Nevertheless,
cryptic sulfur cycling may have major implications for nitrogen
cycling in offshore OMZ waters. For instance, organic matter
mineralization mediated by microbial fermentation coupled to
sulfate reduction yields ammonium that can drive anaerobic
ammonium oxidation (anammox)13. Sulﬁde oxidation, via nitrate
reduction mediated by SUP05, may in turn contribute to the loss
of ﬁxed N13, and to the production of N2O.
SUP05-clade bacteria link nitrogen and sulfur cycling in OMZ
water, and several important questions regarding the distribution,
metabolic capabilities, and actual activities of SUP05 persist. An
accurate census of SUP05 cell abundances in OMZ waters is also
absent, in part because the ﬂuorescent in situ hybridization
(FISH) probe (GSO477) previously employed to identify SUP05
bacteria targets other sulﬁde-oxidizing bacteria, for instance, the
heterotrophic sulﬁde-oxidizing Arctic96BD-19 clade19. Moreover,
the capacity of marine OMZ SUP05 bacteria to perform partial or
full denitriﬁcation in the ETSP or other marine upwelling eco-
systems has also not been determined. A nitrous oxide reductase
gene, nosZ, has not been found in SUP05 genomes studied thus
far5, 11, 20, and it has been suggested that other bacteria associated
with SUP05 perform the ﬁnal denitriﬁcation step of N2O
reduction to N221. Lastly, despite the persistence of apparent
sulfur-based metabolic capacities throughout OMZ waters13–18,
gene sequence abundance cannot be equated with metabolic
activity of the corresponding organisms (e.g., activity may
diminish in offshore waters). Geochemical evidence that would
point to substantial rates of microbial sulfate reduction in off-
shore waters has not been found in the eastern tropical South
Paciﬁc (ETSP), but these natural abundance stable isotope mea-
surements may still be too insensitive to detect estimated rates of
sulfur cycling in these OMZ waters22. The physical oceanography
of the ETSP will play a role in the dispersal of SUP05. In the ETSP
region and in other OMZs, mesoscale eddies forming close to the
coast are known to facilitate the rapid horizontal advection of
coastal geochemical signals and biological communities off-
shore23–25. Thus, the advection of coastal waters into the open
ocean may inﬂuence the occurrence of SUP05 and sulfate-
reducing bacterial communities in offshore waters.
The chemical and hydrographic conditions in the continental
Peru Margin waters of the ETSP in austral summer 2013 provided
a framework for examining the distribution and activity of SUP05
organisms (Fig. 1a). Under normal ﬂow conditions at the Peru
Margin, Ekman transport of the surface, equator-ward ﬂowing
Peru Coastal Current results in near-shore upwelling of the
oxygen-poor and nutrient-rich water derived from the poleward
ﬂowing Peru-Chile Undercurrent26. Instabilities in the Peru-Chile
Undercurrent possibly triggered by sharp variations in shoreline
topography25 lead to the formation of offshore sub-surface
anticyclonic eddies25, 27–29 (Fig. 1b, c; Supplementary Fig. 1).
Thus, in addition to the typical near-shore and offshore ETSP
waters, we obtained samples at the offshore site during a period of
time when the formation of a sub-surface anticyclonic eddy drove
cross-shelf, offshore transport of sulfur-rich shelf waters. To
quantitatively discriminate dominant Peru Upwelling SUP05
bacteria from close relatives of the SUP05 clade, we designed and
applied a more stringent SUP05 probe. Based on a near-complete
metagenomics bin we reconstructed the metabolic capabilities of
the Peru Upwelling SUP05 bacteria. Finally, we speciﬁcally
determined the single-cell C uptake activity of SUP05 bacteria via
isotope-labeling experiments combined with nanoscale secondary
ion mass spectrometry (nanoSIMS) analysis. This allowed us to
evaluate the contribution of SUP05 activity to carbon, nitrogen,
and sulfur cycling both in near-shore and in offshore ETSP OMZ
waters. We provide direct data on the in situ activity of a sulﬁde-
oxidizing, nitrate-reducing organism of importance in OMZ
waters, and ﬁnd that SUP05 continues to be active in waters that
are transported offshore along with elemental sulfur.
Results
Biogeochemical characterization of shelf and offshore waters.
Waters from the ETSP region off the coast of Peru (12°S 78.5°W
and 13.5°S 77°W) were sampled from 8 February to 4 March 2013
onboard
the
RV
Meteor
(Expedition
M93;
Supplemen-
tary Table 1). At the beginning of the sampling period in Feb-
ruary
2013,
an
anticyclonic
mesocale
eddy
had
formed
approximately 50 km from the coast (Fig. 1b; Supplementary
Fig. 1b). During the course of our experiments and sampling, the
sub-surface
eddy
expanded
and
propagated
in
south-
southwesterly direction, eventually veering off in a westerly
direction (Fig. 1b; S1c-f). By March 2013, the eddy had caused a
ﬁlament of surface shelf water moving along the northern rim of
the eddy to extend to nearly 330 km offshore (Fig. 1b). Sub-
surface waters at stations U2, U3, L1, and L3 were impacted by
the resulting cross-shelf transport of shelf waters during and after
the eddy formation25. Station L2, on the other hand, was sampled
after the eddy had traveled already further westwards and caused
the onshore advection of offshore water masses along its southern
rim25. Thus, station L2, referred to here as “non-eddy” for sim-
plicity, exhibited temperature–salinity characteristics typical of
offshore waters, which are clearly separated in the temperature
and salinity space from the stations impacted by coastal waters
(Supplementary Fig. 2).
Station U1 on the shelf was also sampled in early March when
normal (non-eddy) ﬂow conditions prevailed (Supplementary
Fig. 1f). The near-shore, shelf waters at station U1 were
characterized by extreme depletion of dissolved oxygen (below
10 m) and nitrate (below 30 m), and the presence of free dissolved

hydrogen sulﬁde (up to 7 µM) and ammonium (up to 6 µM)
(Fig. 2; Supplementary Figs. 3, 4). Nitrate-depleted, sulﬁde and
elemental sulfur-rich bottom waters covered the entire near-shore
Peruvian shelf between 12°S 78.3°W and 13.3°S 77°W (Fig. 1c;
Supplementary Fig. 3). The reduced sulfur inventories in
February–March 2013 (1.6 × 109 moles H2S and 7.0 × 108 moles
elemental sulfur) were more than twice as large as for the sulﬁdic
event reported for the same area in 20095.
A nitrate-sulﬁde chemocline in the inner shelf waters at 25–35
m water depth (hereafter simply referred to as the chemocline)
coincided with peaks of nitrite and elemental sulfur (Fig. 2;
Supplementary Fig. 4). Elemental sulfur, or cyclooctasulfur S8, is
highly insoluble in sea water30. The elemental sulfur measured in
OMZ waters likely exists as colloidal sulfur; S8 externally
associated with particles and cells; internal cellular deposits of
S8; as well as the sulfane component of dissolved inorganic
polysulﬁdes. An intermediate product of biotic and abiotic sulﬁde
oxidation, elemental sulfur, reached concentrations of up to 6 µM
within the chemocline and persisted at µM concentrations in the
deeper, sulﬁdic waters, most likely as inorganic polysulﬁdes
(Fig. 2; Supplementary Fig. 4). Elemental sulfur likely formed at
30–35 m as chemolithotrophic organisms used downward mixed
nitrate to oxidize hydrogen sulﬁde. Under the denitrifying
conditions found at the base of the chemocline, elemental sulfur
is the ﬁrst product of sulﬁde oxidation31 as depicted in Eq. 1:
5H2S þ 2NO
3 þ 2Hþ ! 5S0 þ N2 þ 6H2O
ð1Þ
Elemental sulfur, which is transported through eddy diffusion
throughout the chemocline, may fuel further nitrate consumption
via denitriﬁcation as shown in Eq. 2.

þ 3N2 þ 4Hþ
ð2Þ
Overall, as estimated from nitrate, elemental sulfur, and sulﬁde
concentration gradients, and employing an eddy diffusion
coefﬁcient of 1.4 × 10−4 m2 s−1 (see Methods), the downward
nitrate ﬂux into the chemocline (17 mmol S m−2 d−1) was more
than sufﬁcient to oxidize the upward ﬂux of sulﬁde (−7.6 mmol S
m−2 d−1) completely to sulfate via denitriﬁcation (combined Eqs.
1 and 2 as shown in Eq. 3)
5H2S þ 8NO
3 ! 5SO2

þ 4N2 þ 4H2O þ 2Hþ
ð3Þ
These estimates encompass the upward eddy diffusion ﬂux of
elemental sulfur in the chemocline, an upper limit for which we
estimate to be −6.6 mmol S m−2 d−1. Up to 70% of the total
nitrate ﬂux could be attributed to the oxidation of sulﬁde within
the chemocline at station U1. Microorganisms such as SUP05
that can couple dissolved sulﬁde oxidation to nitrate reduction
should, therefore, dominate this interface between deep sulﬁdic
waters and overlying nitrate.

on 16S rRNA gene analysis, in both sulﬁdic (stations U1 and U1a)
and in the sulﬁde-free offshore waters (e.g., station L2).
A new FISH probe, GSO131, was designed to target this

Upwelling SUP05-clade bacteria from near relatives within the

densities within the chemocline coincided with peak rates of
denitriﬁcation (2000 nmol N L−1 d−1; Fig. 2e; Supplementary
Fig. 4) and dark carbon ﬁxation (600–1000 nmol C L−1 d−1;
Supplementary Fig. 4). These results support earlier conclusions
that SUP05 is a dominant taxon mediating sulﬁde-driven deni-
triﬁcation at the chemocline in such sulﬁdic, upwelling shelf
waters5, 6.
In contrast to the sulﬁde-rich, nitrate-deplete waters on the
inner shelf, total dissolved sulﬁde concentrations dropped below
detection (<1 µM) on the outer shelf (stations U2 and U3; Fig. 2b)
and offshore beyond the outer shelf break. Elemental sulfur
remained detectable at 100–1000 nM in the oxygen- and nitrate-
depleted deep waters of outer shelf stations U2 and U3, and more
interestingly, persisted in the offshore eddy-inﬂuenced waters of
station L1 where dissolved sulﬁde was not detected (Fig. 2;
Supplementary
Fig.
4).
At
station
L1,
elemental
sulfur
concentrations ranged between 50 and 750 nM from 5 to 100 m
depth, and coincided with a nitrate minimum (Fig. 2; Supple-
mentary Fig. 4). Temperature–salinity properties at station
L1
suggest
that
nitrate-depleted
coastal
waters
containing
elemental sulfur were transported offshore along isopycnals up
to 80 km from the coast (Fig. 2a, c; Supplementary Fig. 2). After
the eddy had moved further offshore, elemental sulfur was
restricted to a narrow band near the surface with concentrations
of <300 nM as seen at station L2 (Fig. 2; Supplementary Figs. 2
and 4).
At the eddy-inﬂuenced offshore station L1, SUP05 cell densities of
up to 4.5 × 105 cells per mL comprised a signiﬁcant fraction (up to
17%) of the microbial community even in the absence of dissolved
sulﬁde (Fig. 2; Supplementary Fig. 4). Rates of nitrate reduction to
N2 at L1 ranged from 5 to 16 nmol N L−1 d−1, and dark carbon
ﬁxation of 9–130 nmol C L−1 d−1 (Fig. 2e; Supplementary Fig. 4)
were much lower than those at station U1 on the inner shelf.
Nonetheless, rates of denitriﬁcation and dark carbon ﬁxation at
station L1 under the inﬂuence of the eddy and cross-shelf transport
exceeded those observed under “non-eddy” conditions (L2). At
station L2 we measured reduced rates of denitriﬁcation (<0.13–4.3
nmol N L−1 d−1) and dark carbon ﬁxation (11 to 51 nmol C L−1 d
−1; Fig. 2e; Supplementary Fig. 4). Correspondingly, SUP05
abundances at L2 were one order of magnitude lower than at
station L1 and comprised only a minor fraction (0–2%) of the

microbial community. Denitriﬁcation rates also broadly correlated
with SUP05 cell densities (DN = (1.14 × log[cell per L]) −7.88; R2
= 0.71).
It has been proposed that sulﬁde produced via microbial sulfate
reduction in marine particle aggregates in the offshore stations
may also fuel offshore SUP05-mediated nitrate reduction, i.e., a
cryptic sulfur cycle13. We observed aggregates containing delta-
proteobacteria (e.g., sulfate-reducing bacteria) in addition to
SUP05 in the samples at the shelf water-inﬂuenced offshore
station L1 (Supplementary Fig. 5). Depth-integrated SUP05
abundances, however, greatly exceeded delta-proteobacteria by
nearly sevenfold (Supplementary Fig. 5), which is also consistent
with other metagenomic and functional gene surveys of offshore
OMZ waters that ﬁnd that key sulfur-based genes afﬁliated to
sulﬁde-oxidizing bacteria consistently outnumber genes afﬁliated to
sulfate-reducing bacteria16, 17. We cannot discount sulﬁde produc-
tion from sulfate-reducing bacteria co-transported with SUP05.
Nonetheless, given rates of sulﬁde oxidation ostensibly associated
with a cryptic sulfur cycle13 (single-cell discussion below), the
SUP05 bacteria could continue for days to weeks to metabolize the
large amounts of elemental sulfur transported offshore (50–175
nmol L−1
or
>20 mmol m−2
at
station
L1,
Supplementary
Figs. 3, 4).
Single-cell activities of SUP05 bacteria. The presence and
abundance of an organism in any given environment, for instance
SUP05 distributions in eddy-inﬂuenced offshore waters, yields
only limited information on the activity of the organism and its
actual impact on the chemistry of the environment. To address
the impact of SUP05 on the cycling and fate of carbon, sulfur, and
nitrogen in ETSP waters, we compared the SUP05-speciﬁc carbon
assimilation in the chemocline at station U1, where SUP05 likely
plays a dominant role in coupling sulﬁde oxidation with deni-
triﬁcation, with SUP05-speciﬁc activities at the “eddy-inﬂuenced”
offshore (L1) and “non-eddy” (L2) stations. We quantiﬁed the
speciﬁc contribution of SUP05 bacteria to dark carbon ﬁxation by
measuring the assimilation of 13C-bicarbonate into SUP05 bio-
mass at the single-cell level using nanoSIMS technology. In
experiments from station U1 with close to ambient concentra-
tions of sulﬁde, elemental sulfur, and nitrate, SUP05 ﬁxed CO2 at
a cell speciﬁc rate of 0.19 ± 0.02 fmol C per cell per day (averaged
from 30 and 60 m depths, Fig. 4; Table 1). SUP05-speciﬁc 15N-
NO3−assimilation rates also increased linearly with SUP05 car-
bon assimilation rates in the same experiments (Supplementary
Fig. 6). At station L1, the SUP05 CO2 ﬁxation rate of 0.17 ± 0.02
fmol C per cell per day was similar to the speciﬁc CO2 ﬁxation
rate determined at station U1 (Fig. 4a; analysis of variance

(ANOVA), p = 0.14, no statistical difference). In the offshore
waters that were unaffected by the eddy, station L2, SUP05 bac-
teria ﬁxed C at a substantially lower rate of 0.06 ± 0.01 fmol C per
cell per day rates (Fig. 4a; ANOVA, p = <0.001). Thus, the uptake
of 13CO2 as determined at the single-cell level showed that SUP05
bacteria actively assimilated CO2 in shelf waters, as well as in shelf
waters that had recently been transported offshore. In offshore
ETSP water masses isolated from the shelf, however, SUP05
bacteria were much less active.
We can put the activity of SUP05 cells into perspective with
respect to carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycling in the ETSP waters
by upscaling the SUP05-speciﬁc carbon uptake rates. There are
large uncertainties inherent to these calculations, as with most
upscaling or extrapolations. The C uptake rate for SUP05 is
dependent on the cell size and carbon density of growing SUP05
cells. Carbon content and carbon density of living bacterial and
archeal cells are points of considerable discussion32, and will
dictate calculated CO2 ﬁxation rates (see Eq. 7 in Methods). We
estimated the C content of the SUP05 cells analyzed by nanoSIMS
using the power relationship based on the most recent cumulative
data for bacterial sizes and biomasses32. SUP05 cells in the Peru
Upwelling at the time of sampling were relatively large (0.18–0.39
µm3 corresponding to 61–83 fg C per cell; Table 1). SUP05
contributed substantially to the total bacterial carbon and dark
carbon ﬁxation rates (Table 1; Fig. 2f) at stations U1 and L1,
which is in line with their large abundances and high per cell C
assimilation rates at these stations. Our estimates suggest that
SUP05 bacteria are on average responsible for up to 50% of the
dark carbon ﬁxation rates on the shelf. They are consistent with
the observation that there are also other chemolithoautotrophic
organisms present in the shelf waters capable of denitriﬁcation
and sulﬁde oxidation (e.g., Epsilonproteobacteria). At the offshore
eddy-inﬂuenced L1 station, most of the dark carbon ﬁxation
could be attributed to SUP05 (up to 100%), whereas only 7% of
the dark carbon ﬁxation could be attributed to SUP05 at the non-
eddy-inﬂuenced station L2 (Table 1). (These are upper values for
% dark carbon ﬁxation, because the bulk dark carbon ﬁxation
rates may be underestimated as the nominal size of the glass ﬁber
ﬁlters used for the bulk 13CO2 uptake determinations is larger
than the 0.2 µm pore size of the polycarbonate (PC) ﬁlters used
for the single-cell 13CO2 uptake rates.) It is interesting to note
that Hawley et al.12, in extrapolating from a gene-centric
biogeochemical model based on quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (qPCR) data and the abundances of SUP05 C ﬁxation
proteins in Saanich Inlet, estimated SUP05-associated C ﬁxation
rates of 10–120 nmol C L−1 d−1 for OMZ waters. Our calculated
in situ rates of SUP05-speciﬁc carbon ﬁxation rates for the ETSP
OMZ waters (ranging from 1.3 to 592 nmol C L−1 d−1 for
stations U1 and L1; Table 1) conﬁrm the proposed importance
of SUP05 to dark carbon ﬁxation in shelf and sulfur-rich OMZ
waters.
Growing, or actively autotrophic SUP05 cells would also be
expected to have an impact on denitriﬁcation and sulﬁde
oxidation. In contrast to the determination of SUP05-speciﬁc C
or N assimilation using nanoSIMS, the direct experimental
determination of single-cell or single-clade respiration rates in the
environment is not yet possible. We can, however, estimate the
potential impact of the SUP05 bacteria nitrogen cycling in the
offshore eddy- and non-eddy-inﬂuenced waters by assuming that
the biomass yield, i.e., the amount of CO2 ﬁxed per cell SUP05
per mol nitrate reduced or per mol sulﬁde or sulfur oxidized is
similar for both near-shore and offshore SUP05 cells. Cultivated
sulﬁde oxidizers growing on sulﬁde and oxygen exhibit biomass
yields of 0.35–0.58 mol CO2 ﬁxed per mol H2S oxidized33–35.
Assuming similar yields for nitrate-dependent sulﬁde oxidation
yields 0.22–0.37 mol CO2 ﬁxed per mol nitrate reduced based on
the stoichiometry in Eq. 3. Estimated rates of sulﬁde-dependent
denitriﬁcation attributable to SUP05 at stations U1 (830–2180
nmol N L−1 d−1) and L2 (1–3 nmol N L−1 d−1) are at the upper
range of experimentally determined bulk denitriﬁcation rates
(Table 1), or exceed bulk denitriﬁcation rates by up to threefold at
station
L1
(24–62 nmol N L−1 d−1).
Estimates
of
nitrate-
dependent sulfur oxidation in the sulfur-rich, offshore waters at
station L1 (15–40 nmol S L−1 d−1) are approximately two- to
threefold greater than sulﬁde oxidation rates measured by
Canﬁeld et al.13 of 5–21 nmol L−1 d−1. All of these estimates
involve large uncertainties. Environmental biomass yields for
important
chemolithoautotrophic
denitrifying
processes
are
lacking and are likely to be lower than those determined for
aerobic processes and pure culture organisms36. SUP05 may also
perform aerobic sulfur oxidation5, 11 (see also the discussion in
the next section), and thus, part of its C ﬁxation activity may be
linked to microaerophilic respiration, especially in offshore
waters. Nevertheless, the high rates of CO2-ﬁxing activity directly
linked to SUP05 cells suggest that SUP05 has the potential to
substantially contribute to rates of denitriﬁcation and sulfur
oxidation both on the shelf and in sulfur-rich shelf waters
transported offshore.
Peru Upwelling SUP05 ecophysiology. Metagenomics, in com-
bination with nanoSIMS analysis, show that SUP05 is well
adapted to the sulﬁde-poor conditions in water masses trans-
ported offshore. We assembled and binned a draft genome at 95%

the Peru Upwelling SUP05 from the metagenome for station U1.
The draft genome encoded genes involved in the reverse dis-
similatory sulﬁte reduction pathway (rdsr) used in the oxidation
of intracellular S0, as well as an incomplete periplasmic thiosulfate
oxidation pathway by sox (Fig. 5). The incomplete sox pathway,
speciﬁcally the absence of soxCD genes, has previously been
observed for members of the SUP05 bacterial clade5, 11, 37, 38, and
has been linked to intracellular sulfur deposits in other sulﬁde
oxidizers39, 40. Empirically, sulfur deposits have been shown to
accumulate intracellularly in Arctic96BD-19 bacteria, a closely
related lineage of SUP0541. Moreover, with nanoSIMS, we found
that SUP05 cells at stations U1 and L1 had signiﬁcantly greater
(ANOVA, p = <0.001) sulfur content compared to cells at station
L2 (Fig. 4b), which suggested that SUP05 has a capacity to store
and consume sulfur. The stored sulfur, deposited in an inorganic
or organic form, is putatively oxidized via the rdsr pathway42. The
organism can also use thiosulfate. Thiosulfate was detected in the
chemocline at station U1 (400 nM), but was below detection (50
nM) at offshore stations L1 and L2 (Supplementary Fig. 4). The
presence of the high-afﬁnity cytochrome cbb3 complex indicates
that electrons from the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds
can be used to reduce trace concentrations of dissolved O2 to
water. The obtained ETSP-SUP05 genome shows that energy can
also be conserved by coupling the oxidation of sulfur to nitrate
reduction to N2 (Fig. 5). In contrast to the Saanich Inlet SUP05
metagenome that lacks the nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ)
gene11, 12, 20, the ETSP-SUP05 genome encodes a complete
denitriﬁcation pathway, including nosZ (Fig. 5). The detection of
the SUP05 nosZ gene at the same coverage as the rest of the
SUP05 genome in stringent metagenomic read mappings at sta-
tion L1 indicate that, functionally, the same SUP05-clade strain
was present as in station U1. Thus, the genomic capability of
SUP05 organisms active in the ETSP predicts that they can per-
form complete denitriﬁcation coupled to sulﬁde and elemental
sulfur oxidation.
The Peru Upwelling SUP05 bacteria described here has only a
97.6% 16S rRNA sequence identity (ANI percentage of 74%) with
Candidatus Thioglobus autotrophicus20. Unlike Ca. T. autotro-
phicus, it has the full denitriﬁcation pathway. As we are able to
distinguish the Peru Upwelling SUP05 clade at the species level43,
we propose a uncultivated taxa (U) name for the Peru Upwelling
SUP05 bacteria “UThioglobus perditus”44. Perditus means lost.
The Peru Upwelling SUP05 bacterium UT. perditus ﬁnds itself lost
in the offshore OMZ waters.
Implications for cryptic sulfur cycling. Mesoscale eddies, like
the one described in this study, are common throughout the
ETSP OMZ. Long-term remote sensing data indicate that ~50%
of the ETSP OMZ area is covered by mesoscale eddies at any one
time45 that likely have a substantial impact on the chemistry and
biology of offshore waters46. In March 2013, several chlorophyll-
rich ﬁlaments were seen projecting from the ETSP coastline with
some of the ﬁlaments extending up to a remarkable 1500 km from
the coast (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 7). Our results show that
in addition to chlorophyll, reduced sulfur from the anoxic inner
shelf waters was transported offshore as a result of mesoscale
processes. During our research campaign 1.6 × 109 moles of dis-
solved sulﬁde H2S and 7.0 × 108 moles of elemental sulfur accu-
mulated on the inner shelf. We conclude that a substantial part of
this reduced sulfur escaped oxidation on the shelf and was
transported offshore. Moreover, mesoscale eddy-driven cross-
shelf transport led to the dispersal of microbes such as the
SUP05-clade bacteria UT. perditus from the sulﬁdic shelf waters
to the offshore OMZ waters. The single-cell carbon ﬁxation data

show that the populations of UT. perditus continued to be highly
active in these non-sulﬁdic offshore OMZ waters.
Our results show that mesoscale eddy-driven water mass
movement can explain the abundance and activity of sulﬁde-
oxidizing denitrifying bacteria in sulﬁde-poor offshore OMZ
waters and can drive “cryptic sulfur cycling” via the continued
oxidation of co-transported elemental sulfur. In fact, chlorophyll-
rich ﬁlaments indicating cross-shelf transport also occurs in the
Chilean upwelling region where cryptic sulfur cycling was ﬁrst
reported13 (e.g., Supplementary Fig. 7). Thus, eddy-driven cross-
shelf transport combined with the capability of UT. perditus to
denitrify and thrive on elemental sulfur in the absence of dissolved
sulﬁde may contribute to its success in OMZ waters worldwide.
Methods
Sampling and hydrography. Waters were sampled in the ETSP region off the
coast of Peru (12°S 78.5°W and 13.5°S 77°W) from 8 February to 4 March 2013
onboard the RV Meteor (Supplementary Table 1). Either a CTD rosette equipped
with twenty-four 10 L Niskin bottles was used to collect water samples or a pump-
CTD. Oxygen, temperature, and salinity were recorded with depth on both up and
downcasts of the CTD. The mesoscale eddy and shelf currents were tracked by
horizontal velocities surveyed by glider deployments and vessel mounted acoustic
doppler current proﬁlers from January to March 201325.
Nutrient and sulfur chemistry. Samples for nutrient and reduced sulfur chemistry
were obtained from the pump-CTD downcasts. Sulﬁde concentrations were
determined by the methylene blue method47 immediately from Niskin bottles using
4 mL of sample and 320 µL of diamine reagent. The diamine solution and samples
were incubated in the dark at ambient temperatures (18–22 °C) prior to measuring
with a spectrophotometry at 670 nm. The detection limit of this method is 1 µM.
Separate nutrient samples were taken for the analysis of nitrate, nitrite, and
ammonium, and were measured onboard with a QuAAtro autoanalyzer (Seal
Analytical). The detection limits are 0.1, 0.1, and 0.3 µM, respectively.
For the analysis of elemental sulfur chemistry sulﬁdic waters were immediately
ﬁxed in zinc chloride (100 µL of 20% (weight/weight) in 50 mL sample), and stored
at −20 °C. Elemental sulfur was extracted by a chloroform-methanol procedure
using 5–15 mL of sample volume48. Internal standard (31.2 mg of 4,4′-dibromo
diphenyl (Sigma Aldrich)) dissolved in 100 mL methanol) was added to back
calculate the extraction efﬁciency. Three rounds of chloroform extraction (500 µL
each) were performed. After each step the chloroform sample mixture was
sonicated for 15 min at 4 °C and then the chloroform was pipetted off into a glass
vial where it was concentrated under an N2 stream. In the last stage the extracted
product was dissolved in methanol and ﬁltered to remove larger particles (0.45 µm
ﬁlter). The methanol-dissolved sample was measured by ultrahigh pressure liquid
chromatography (UPLC) using a Waters Acquity H-class instrument with a Waters
column (Aquity UPLC BEH C18, 1.7 µm, 2.1 × 50 mm column; Waters, Japan) and
methanol eluent ﬂowing at 0.4 mL min−1 equipped with a Waters PDA detector
(absorbance wavelength set to 265 nm). The detection limit of elemental sulfur
using this method was 50 nM.
Thiosulfate concentrations in collected seawater samples were quantiﬁed
by the monobromobimane derivatization method49. Derivatization of the
samples was done in 1.8 mL glass vials in a dark room. A 500 µL sample was ﬁxed
in 50 µL of HEPES-EDTA buffer (pH 8) and 50 µL of monobromobimane
(45–48 mM, Sigma Aldrich). The reaction was stopped after 30 min by adding 50
µL of methansulfonic acid (324 mM). Bimane ﬁxed samples were measured by
UPLC using a Waters Acquity H-class instrument with a Waters column (Aquity
UPLC BEH C8, 1.7 µm, 2.1 × 50 mm column; Waters, Japan) and an acetic
acid/methanol gradient ﬂowing at 0.65 mL min−1 equipped with a Waters FLR
detector (excitation and absorbance wavelength was set to 380 and 480 nm,
respectively). The detection limit of this method based on standard preparations
was 50 nM. Integration of peak areas was done using Waters Empower 3
software.
The sulﬁde, sulfur, and nitrate ﬂuxes were determined at the chemocline at
station U1 from 30 to 40 m, 20 to 30 m, and 12 to 30 m depth, respectively. The
eddy diffusivity (1.4 × 10−4 m2 s−1) was determined for the mid to upper shelf of
the Peruvian upwelling region from microstructure proﬁles (Schlosser et al., in
preparation). A negative value indicates an upward water column ﬂux.

15N- and 13C-labeled incubation experiments. Sea water was transferred from the
Niskin bottles into 250 mL glass serum bottles and 15N-labeled incubation
experiments were performed according to Holtappels et al.50. Bottles were allowed
to gently overﬂow two to three times and then were capped avoiding oxygen
contamination. All bottles, unless sampled from a sulﬁdic depth, were bubbled with
helium gas for 15 min. 15N- and 13C-labeled substrates were added after 5 min of
purging
in the following experiments: exp1: 15N-NO3−+ 13C-HCO3−; exp2: 15N-NO2−+
14N-NH4+ + 13C-HCO3−; and exp3: 15N-NH4+ + 14N-NO2−+ 13C-HCO3−.
Concentrations of labeled substrates were 25, 5, and 5 µm for NO3−, NO2−, and
NH4+, respectively. At sulﬁdic depths serum bottles were not bubbled with gas in
order to maintain ambient sulﬁde concentrations, instead, labeled substrates were
mixed by stirring. Serum bottles were overﬂown two times into small glass vials
(Exetainers, Labco Limited; 6 or 12 mL) and capped. The caps 2–3 days prior to use
were stored in a pre-degassed Duran bottle ﬁlled with a helium atmosphere, to
reduce oxygen contamination in the incubation experiments51. Exetainer incuba-
tion experiments were incubated at 12 °C in the dark. After adding a 2 mL helium
headspace, Exetainer samples were terminated at 0, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h by the
addition of 100 µL of saturated mercury chloride solution. (See the following
publications50–52 for discussions of incubation methods and potential artefacts.)
Terminated incubation samples were stored cap down at room temperature. For
nanoSIMS analysis a separate 24-h incubation vial was terminated by the addition
of a 20% paraformaldehyde solution to a ﬁnal concentration of 1–2%.
Isotopic ratios of 15N15N and 15N14N dinitrogen gas were measured from the
headspace of the incubation experiments using a gas-chromatography isotope-ratio
mass spectrometer (GC-IRMS; VG Optima, Manchester, UK). The nitrite
production was determined from amended 15NO3−experiments performed by
converting labeled nitrite to 14N15N gas53. The converted N2 gas was measured by
a GC-IRMS (customized TraceGas coupled to a multicollector IsoPrime100,
Manchester, UK). Denitriﬁcation and anammox N2 production rates were
calculated from the linear regression slope as a function of time according to
Thamdrup et al.54. A t-test was used to determine whether rates were signiﬁcantly
different from zero (p < 0.05). Detection limits were estimated from the median of
the standard error of the slope, multiplied by the t-value for p = 0.05, the detection
limits for anammox, denitriﬁcation to N2, and denitriﬁcation to NO2−from
15N-labeled experiments were 1.03, 0.13, and 0.80 nM N d−1, respectively.
Bulk CO2 ﬁxation rates were determined separately from 13C-incubation
experiments performed in gas tight 4.5 L bottles5. To each bottle 4.5 mL of labeled
bicarbonate solution (1 g 13C-HCO3−in 50 mL water) was added. Depending on
sample depth bottles were incubated at in situ temperatures on-deck in blue shaded
incubation boxes (25% surface irradiance) or in the dark. After 24 h, 1–2 L was
ﬁltered onto pre-combusted Whatman GFF ﬁlters. GFF ﬁlters were dried and then
treated to remove inorganic carbon by fuming 37% HCl treatment overnight. The
isotopic 13C enrichment was quantiﬁed by an element analyzer EA-IRMS (FlashEA
1112 series coupled with an IRMS, Finnigan Delta plus XP, Thermo Scientiﬁc).
Carbon ﬁxation rates were calculated according to Schunck et al.5.
Molecular sampling. Samples (1–2 L) collected for microbial enumeration by
catalyzed reporter deposition FISH (CARD-FISH) were immediately ﬁxed in 20%
paraformaldehyde solution to a ﬁnal concentration of 1–2%. Fixed samples were
ﬁltered onboard after 8–12 h at 4 °C onto a 0.2 µm pore-size PC ﬁlter. Filtration
volumes varied according to depth and location from the coast (i.e., 70–120 mL at
offshore stations and 50–70 mL at coastal stations) in order to get adequate
cell densities on the ﬁlter. Filters for nanoSIMS analysis were collected from
13C-HCO3−-labeled incubation experiments (exp1) onto pre-coated gold-palla-
dium 0.2 µm PC ﬁlters. For biomass collection and subsequent DNA analysis,
larger volumes of sea water (1–2 L) were ﬁltered onto a 0.2 µm PC ﬁlters. All ﬁlters
were stored and transported between −20 and −80 °C.
DNA extraction, metagenomics, and genome binning. DNA was extracted from
ﬁltered biomass using a DNA/RNA-Allprep kit (Qiagen). Extracted genomic DNA
was sequenced with Illumina MiSeq technology and chemistry (Max Planck
Institute for Evolutionary Biology, Plön, Germany). Full-length 16S rRNA gene
sequences were reconstructed from raw reads using phyloFlash (https://github.
com/HRGV/phyloFlash). Adapters and low-quality reads were removed with
bbduk (https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/) with a minimum quality value of
two and a minimum length of 36, yielding 1 464 909 and 2 143 435 paired-end
reads for library preparations from station U1 at depths 30 and 40 m, respectively.
Single reads were excluded from the analysis. Single library assemblies were per-
formed using SPAdes 3.9055 with standard parameters and kmers 21, 33, 55, 77, 99,
and 127. Genome binning was performed in Bandage56 by collecting all contigs
linked to the contig that contained the full-length 16S rRNA gene of the SUP05
organism as reconstructed by phyloFlash. The genome completeness for all SUP05
bins was calculated using checkM version 1.0757 and the gammaproteobacterial
marker gene set using the taxonomy workﬂow. Annotation was performed using
prokka58. Genes related to nitrate respiration (nirS, narG, norB, and nosZ) and
carbon ﬁxation (cbbM) were visualized on the assembly graph of the SUP05 bin
using the Bandage BLAST module with 98% query coverage and 98% identity
settings. Read mappings to screen for the presence of the UT. perditus nosZ gene
were performed using bbmap with fast = t and minid = 0.95 to only obtain reads
reported that come from the same species.
Clone library and phylogeny. Universal bacterial primers GM3f (5′-
AGAGTTTGATCMTGGC-3′) and GM4r (5′-TACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′) were
used to generate full-length 16S rRNA PCR amplicons from DNA samples taken at
the redoxcline of sulﬁdic station U1 (Supplementary Table 2; 59). Five PCR
replicates were done per sample. The PCR conditions were initial denaturation at
95 °C for 5 min, followed by 25 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for
2 min, and a ﬁnal extension of 72 °C for 10 min. The reactions were run on an
Eppendorf Mastercycler gradient PCR machine with a ramp rate of 3 °C s−1. The
ﬁve replicate PCR products were pooled. DNA was visualized by gel electrophoresis
and quantiﬁed by Nanodrop (Thermo Scientiﬁc). The 16S rRNA gene product was
puriﬁed and ligated into a TOPO TA vector using a ligation kit (Invitrogen).
Resulting Escherichia coli clones were picked and screened for the vector insert by
PCR. Colonies with inserts were regrown in fresh media followed by a plasmid
extraction using a plasmid extraction kit (MoBio). The plasmid was ampliﬁed in
two separate ﬁnal sequencing reactions using forward and reverse M13 primers
(M13f 5′-CCCAGTCACGACGTTGTAAAACG-3′ and M13r 5′-AGCGGATAA-
CAATTTCACACAGG3′60). The PCR product was puriﬁed using Sephadex (G-50
Superﬁne, Amersham Bioscience) and then sequenced with Sanger sequencing
chemistry in-house in Bremen (BigDye sequencing kit, Applied Biosystems).
Raw sequence data were quality controlled and vector ends were trimmed, then
forward and reverse amplicons were assembled into near-full-length 16S rRNA
contigs using Sequencher 4.6 software (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI).
The 16S rRNA contigs were aligned with the SINA aligner61, and then imported
into SILVAref115 curated 16S rRNA reference database62 using ARB software63. A
16S rRNA tree was calculated using the parsimony and neighbor joining methods
using various ﬁlters. A CARD-FISH probe (GSO131) was designed in silico using
ARB software to target the 16S rRNA gene of SUP05 bacteria recovered from the
ETSP region (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3; Fig. 3). The GSO131 probe was tested
both in silico and then evaluated on ﬁlters collected at station U1 using different
formamide contents (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60%) (Supplementary Discussion;
Supplementary Fig. 8).
Fluorescence in situ hybridization. The CARD-FISH procedure was performed
on samples collected on PC ﬁlters according to Pernthaler et al.64. Brieﬂy, ﬁlter
pieces were treated with lysozyme (10 g L−1) for 45 min at 37 °C to permeabilize
the cells for hybridization. The ﬁlters were washed in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) buffer and then Milli-Q water before proceeding to the deactivation of
endogenous peroxidases with methanol/hydrogen peroxide (0.15%) treatment for
10 min at room temperature. Samples were washed with Milli-Q before performing
the hybridization. Filter pieces were incubated for 3 h at 46 °C in the hybridization
buffer containing a 35% formamide concentration. Filters were washed in pre-
warmed washing buffer containing NaCl (0.08 M ﬁnal concentration), 5 mM
EDTA (pH 8.0), 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 0.01% SDS for 15 min at 48 °C
then washed again for 10 min in 1× PBS buffer at room temperature. Filter pieces
were incubated for 45 min at 46 °C in ampliﬁcation buffer containing 0.15% H2O2
and 20 µg Oregon Green-labeled tyramide. Filters were washed in 1× PBS and
Milli-Q then dried before staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; 1
µg mL−1) for 10 min at room temperature. Filter pieces were embedded in a
mixture of Citiﬂuor/Vectorshield and DAPI and probe-hybridized signals were
counted on an epiﬂuorescence microscope (Zeiss AxioPlan). Up to 1000 DAPI-
stained cells from 10 different ﬁelds of view were counted. Separate CARD-FISH
probes EUB338 and NON338 were used as positive and negative controls,
respectively64.
NanoSIMS analysis. Select ﬁeld of views containing hybridized SUP05 cells were
marked using a Laser Microdissection microscope (DM 6000 B, Leica). Isotopic
composition of single cells of SUP05 bacteria were analyzed using a NanoSIMS 50L
instrument (Cameca). We used the 19 F signal to detect SUP05 cells hybridized
with the GSO131 probe to conﬁrm regions of interest. All samples were pre-
sputtered with a Cs+ primary ion beam of ~300 pA. After pre-sputtering the
instrument was tuned on the target area on a 50 × 50 raster size for a mass reso-
lution over 8000. Secondary ions of 12C, 13C, 19F, 12C14N, 12C15N, 31P, and 32S
were measured simultaneously on seven electron multiplier detectors with Cs+
primary ion beam of 1.5–2.0 pA. Final analysis and image acquisition was done at
10 × 10 raster size (256 × 256 pixel) and a dwell time of 1 ms per pixel for 40 planes.
The data were processed using Look@NanoSIMS software65. The ﬁeld of interest
were drift-corrected and accumulated using the software. Cells of interest were
interactively deﬁned by hand and classiﬁed. For each cell 13C/12C, 12C15N/12C14N,
and 32S/12C+13C ratios were calculated. Only cells with Poisson statistics <5% were
considered reliable measurements.
NanoSIMS was also performed on an untreated (i.e. no CARD-FISH) ﬁlter at
station U1 (30 m depth) to determine if the isotopic fraction of 13C in SUP05 cells
was potentially diluted by the CARD-FISH protocol66. Based on CARD-FISH
enumeration, we assumed that at least half the cells measured by nanoSIMS on the
non-CARD-FISH ﬁlter were SUP05 bacteria. In this case, no difference in the
average isotopic composition was found between the treated (0.19 ± 0.02 fmol C per

samples. Sulfur ionizes much better than carbon; furthermore, the ionization of
elements is matrix-dependent. Nevertheless, the matrices across all the cell samples
were similar, and certainly across the cells identiﬁed as belonging to the SUP05
clade.
Single-cell calculations. The cell size, determined from Look@NanoSIMS soft-
ware, was used to estimate the cell biovolume (V). We have chosen the more
conservative calculation for carbon content per cell volume for bacteria32. SUP05
cell biovolume (V) was calculated according to the volume of a cylinder with two
half-spheres as ends (e.g., a rounded rod67).
V ¼ πB2ð0:125A  0:0833BÞ
ð4Þ
where A is the length of the rod and B is the diameter of the rod.
We estimated the cell carbon content according to the allometric relationship
between the cell biovolume (V) and carbon content32:
fg C per cell ¼ 135V0:438
ð5Þ
This equation takes into account the higher carbon content of smaller cells (i.e.,
because of the minimum set of molecules a cell has, small cells tend to have larger
carbon contents per volume than larger cells32).
For each cell the fraction C ﬁxed per unit time (f) can be determined from the
13C/12C ratios obtained for individual cells, the known labeling percentage, and the
incubation time.
f ¼ fraction C fixed per day

where 13C/12Ccell is the 13C/12C ratio on cells measured by nanoSIMS, 13C/
12Cbackground is the background natural abundance of unlabeled cell material, and
13C/12CDIC is the fraction of dissolved inorganic carbon labeled with 13C, and t is
incubation time in days.
The single-cell carbon assimilation rate is calculated by multiplying Eq. 6 by the
per cell C content.
Cell specific rate of C fixation ¼ f ´ fmol C per cell
ð7Þ
SUP05 bacteria-associated CO2 ﬁxation was calculated using the single-cell CO2
ﬁxation rate (fmol C per cell per day) and the SUP05 cell densities (cells per L). The
percent contribution of SUP05 to bulk carbon ﬁxation was calculated from the
SUP05 CO2 ﬁxation rate divided by the bulk CO2 ﬁxation rate.
