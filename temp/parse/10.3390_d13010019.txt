Abstract: Despite recent advances, we still do not understand how chronic nutrient enrichment
impacts coastal plant community structure and function. We aimed to clarify such impacts by testing
for differences in ecosystem productivity and multiple community metrics in response to fertilization.
We established plots in 2015 consisting of control (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and nitrogen +
phosphorus (NP) treatments in a mid-Atlantic coastal grassland. In 2017 we collected aboveground
biomass, functional traits, and species abundance for each plot. Our ﬁndings indicate a synergistic co-
limitation, such that NP plots were more productive than all other treatments. A combination of traits
responsible for competition and nutrient uptake (i.e., height and δ15N) caused trait-based divergence
of N and NP plots from C and P plots. Functional trait-based composition patterns differed from
species composition and lifeform abundance patterns, highlighting complexities of community
response to nutrient enrichment. While trait-based functional alpha-diversity did not differ among
nutrient treatments, it was positively correlated with biomass production, suggesting nutrients may
impact functional alpha-diversity indirectly through increased productivity. Increased functional
alpha-diversity could be a mechanism of co-existence emerging as productivity increases. These
results have important implications for understanding how plant communities in low-productivity
coastal systems are altered by fertilization.

1. Introduction
Global scale research has revealed effects of nutrient additions on productivity, species
diversity/composition, and functional trait expressions of plant communities [1–4]. It is
recognized that anthropogenic activity alters global nutrient availability and deposition,
most notably nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) [5,6]. Anthropogenic sources now surpass
any natural process contributing to nutrient deposition [1,7,8]. Rapidly increasing rates
of N and P addition through anthropogenic sources result in the emergence of questions
regarding the effects nutrients, both individually and synergistically, have on the plant
community and ecosystem dynamics.
Elser et al. [9] and Fay et al. [1] detail synergistic effects of N and P, demonstrating that
in terrestrial ecosystems, simultaneous addition of N and P (NP) causes a larger response
than either nutrient does individually. Studies have shown increased deposition affects
more than just productivity. For example, increases in vegetative biomass after three years
of nutrient addition cause subsequent decreases in sub-canopy light availability [4,10], of-
ten resulting in plant species loss [11–14]. Studies investigating plant community response
to nutrient additions indicate that nutrient enrichment can change community spatial and
temporal variability, as well as alter succession patterns and community structure [15–17].

La Pierre and Smith [3] found that species experiencing chronic fertilization express differ-
ences in functional traits compared to species in ambient conditions. These previous works
highlight the importance of investigating plant traits to understand mechanisms altering
community structure in response to chronic nutrient enrichment [18–20]. Although the
aforementioned research has laid the foundation regarding potential effects of nutrient
enrichment on global change, gaps remain. For example, a number of studies have in-
vestigated trait-based community patterns in response to nutrient enrichment [21,22], but
uncertainties still remain regarding effects of nutrient enrichment on functional trait-based
diversity (i.e., diversity of traits).
Limitations using species diversity to express plant diversity have increased interest
in quantifying functional trait-based diversity (functional diversity) to answer questions
regarding plant community organization, species interactions, and response to distur-
bances [23,24]. Functional diversity has become an important metric for understanding
how species, as dynamic parts of a community, change organismal traits through interac-
tions with the environment, which can impact ecosystem functioning [25,26]. Functional
diversity metrics are indicators of community structural response to environmental per-
turbations [27] and can be measured across multiple scales [28]. Both functional alpha-
and beta-diversity are computed using quantitative functional trait data collected on mem-
bers of the plant community. Here we deﬁne functional beta-diversity as the site-to-site
variation among functional trait deﬁned communities, while functional alpha-diversity is
deﬁned as functional trait diversity at the local-scale (i.e., within a plot). These diversity
metrics, along with analysis of speciﬁc differences in functional trait expression, can help
decipher mechanisms of altered trait-based community structure in response to nutrient
enrichment and increased productivity. Current research focusing on functional diversity
does not identify uniﬁed patterns of plant communities in response to nutrient enrichment,
suggesting that responses may be dependent on combinations of nutrient treatments and
regional or local pressures [29–31].
Most prominent nutrient enrichment studies have been conducted in agroecosystems
or prairie grasslands with different soil proﬁles than coastal grasslands. Coastal grassland
soils are characterized by their highly leached sandy composition resulting in low nutrient
content and low water holding capacity [32]. Increased N deposition is expected to occur
in coastal ecosystems [33,34], and previous work has highlighted the need to understand
how nutrients inﬂuence coastal plant communities [35,36]. Focusing on the coastal sys-
tem response to nutrient accumulation will identify mechanisms altering coastal plant
community function, leading to improved predictions of community trajectory and future
functional change [34,35]. This is especially true for barrier island systems, where plant
communities are tied closely to disturbance response [37].
Barrier islands are coastal systems occurring along 15% of coastlines globally with
most occurring in the northern hemisphere [38]. Geographic areas where barrier islands are
common coincide with areas expected to experience increased synthetic fertilizer use [33,39].
By 2100, N enrichment in the continental U.S. is expected to increase by 19%, with the At-
lantic coast experiencing the largest regional increase [39]. High nutrient enrichment from
run-off and atmospheric deposition is a major inﬂuence on barrier island plant communities
given the prominence of sandy-soil compositions and high N limitation [32,36]. Nutrient
enrichment studies on coastal dune systems show that N addition causes long-term plant
community change [36], yet P has not been identiﬁed as a limiting nutrient in terrestrial
coastal systems [40,41]. Patterns revealing NP synergistic co-limitation at global scales
necessitates investigation of both nutrients in coastal systems [1,9]. We build upon previous
research by investigating effects of nutrient enrichment on trait-based communities of a
mid-Atlantic coastal mesic grassland.
Our goal was twofold. First, we tested how chronic (3 year) nutrient addition affects
trait-based community structure and function. Speciﬁcally, we tested whether N, P, and NP
enrichment increases community-level biomass and/or modiﬁes speciﬁc functional trait
expressions. We hypothesize that, due to N limitation in coastal systems, biomass will show
Diversity 2021, 13, 19

notable increase under N and NP treatments, with NP prompting a co-limitation effect such
that biomass produced after NP fertilization will be signiﬁcantly higher than biomass pro-
duced by N or P alone. Furthermore, we predict that functional traits promoting resource
acquisition (e.g., height, speciﬁc leaf area, and leaf N traits) will be expressed in N and NP
treatments, due to increased competition for light in nutrient-rich environments. Second,
we investigated community-level functional trait change using trait-based community
composition and trait diversity (functional alpha- and beta-diversity). We hypothesize that
N and NP treatments will alter trait-based community composition and that such changes
will be accompanied by increased functional alpha- and beta-diversity. Furthermore, we
expect that functional alpha- and beta-diversity will have a signiﬁcant relationship with
biomass productivity. Identifying how nutrients impact productivity, speciﬁc functional
trait expressions, and trait-based community composition and diversity may improve
predictions of trait-based vegetation change in sand-based coastal grasslands as global
change drivers like nutrient enrichment persist.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Site
Hog Island (37.417 N, 75.686 W) is one of 13 barrier islands in the Virginia Coast
Reserve (VCR) Long-Term Ecological Research site along the US Atlantic coast. The VCR is
experiencing shrub encroachment by Morella cerifera on a landscape scale [42]. M. cerifera is
a N-ﬁxing shrub that dominates later successional swales and may be facilitated by the
presence of a grass canopy [43,44]. Due to extensive shrub cover on the northern end of
Hog Island, plots were established on the southern end in a recently developed swale (i.e.,
dune slack) composed of perennial grass and annual/biennial forb species. Dominant
graminoids at our grassland site included Spartina patens, Setaria parvifolia, Andropogon
virginicus, and Ammophila breviligulata, which is a common dune grass in this region but
also occurs frequently in swales [43]. Other graminoid species like Fimbrystylis castanea and
Cyperus esculentes were less abundant but were also found at the site. Forb species were
generally less dominant but included Solidago sempervirens and Conyza canadensis. Soils at
our nutrient enrichment plots are sandy and well-drained, and relatively young due to
high overwash occurrence in the early 2000s. Untreated areas indicate that %N in the soils
ranged from 0.02–0.03%, while P ranged from 6–10 ppm.
2.2. Plot Establishment and Nutrient Application
Nutrient enrichment plots were installed on Hog Island in 2015 [45]. Plots followed a
randomized design modiﬁed from the Nutrient Network (https://nutnet.org/) to include
three treatments (N = nitrogen, P = phosphorus, NP = nitrogen + phosphorus, and C =
Control), replicated ﬁve times per treatment (N = 20 total experimental units, n = 5 per
treatment). Each unit was 3 m2 with 1 m walkways, which were not recognized as usable
plot space. Units were subdivided into four 1 m2 subplots. Nutrient applications were
completed twice per growing season (May and June) from 2015-2017. Annual N and P
application totaled 10 g m−2 yr−1, while NP plots totaled 20 g m−2 yr−1 (10 g m−2 of N and
10 g m−2 of P). Phosphorus was applied as triple super phosphate, while N was applied as
ammonium nitrate in particulate solid form.
2.3. Biomass and Species Composition Sampling
Biomass was deﬁned as all aboveground vegetation at the end of the 2017 growing
season (September 2017) and was collected to assess ecosystem productivity. Aboveground
vegetation was harvested from one subplot to ground level within a haphazardly placed
0.1 × 1 m frame and extrapolated to represent plot level productivity (g m−2). Samples
were oven-dried for 72 h at 60 ◦C and weighed (g). Species composition was sampled using
areal cover estimation (%) of each species, bare ground, and dead plant material, such
that total cover of each plot summed to 100%. In July of 2017, species cover was assessed
in a subplot that had not previously been used for destructive sampling. For logistical
Diversity 2021, 13, 19

purposes, the ﬁve most abundant species in each plot were used for trait sampling. The
top ﬁve species accounted for ~75% of the relative vegetation cover in all plots. Spartina
patens and A. breviligulata were consistently the most dominant species in each plot. The
annual forb C. canadensis had top ﬁve abundance in C and N plots but not in P or NP plots.
This was the only difference in lifeform of the top ﬁve species as all other species were
graminoids.
2.4. Functional Trait Selection and Sampling
Functional traits were selected to best understand the mechanisms of plant response to
ecological dynamics including environmental and biotic interactions. Aboveground traits
we selected highlight some trade-offs between rapid growth and resource conservatism.
Investigating plant traits that exist on a resource use spectrum aids in understanding mech-
anisms of survival for plants in areas of different limiting factors [46]. Maximum height was
selected as a competitive trait, as it likely indicates plant response to low light from shading
during increased biomass productivity [47]. Height covaries with other plant growth
traits including photosynthetic rate, relative growth rate, and leaf lifespan [48]. Leaf traits
including speciﬁc leaf area (SLA) leaf nitrogen content (%N), and leaf carbon content (%C)
indicate trade-offs between rapid growth and resource conservation in highly productive
and resource-limited communities [49,50]. Last, 15N:14N (δ15N) was selected to investigate
mechanisms of nutrient uptake or ﬁxation through symbiotic relationships [51–53].
Maximum height was measured in cm before harvesting by extending the longest leaf
of the three tallest individuals for each species. Aboveground samples were harvested for
one randomly selected individual for each of the top ﬁve species in each plot. Samples were
immediately wrapped in the moist paper towel, stored in a plastic bag, and were stored in
a dark refrigerator while processing took place. One leaf from each plant was re-hydrated
and used to measure SLA using a computer scanning method to digitize leaf samples and
capture projected leaf area (cm2). Leaf samples were then oven-dried at 60 ◦C for 72 h
and weighed (g). Dried leaf samples were ground into powder with a Wiley Mini-Mill
and shipped to the Cornell Isotope Laboratory (COIL, Ithaca, New York, USA) for carbon
and nitrogen elemental analysis (%C and %N) and isotope analysis (δ15N). All samples for
aforementioned foliar traits were collected in the summer of 2017. Species abundance was
used to calculate community-weighted means (CWMs) for each functional trait:
CWM =
R
∑
i
piti
(1)
where R is the number of samples, pi is the relative abundance of species i, and ti is the
mean trait value of species i [54].
2.5. Statistical Analysis
All analyses conducted as part of this study were performed using R (R Core Team,
v. 3.5.0, 2018). To determine the effect of nutrient enrichment on plot scale productivity,
we performed a one-way ANOVA on mean biomass production in 2017 (α = 0.05). Tukey
HSD was performed to test for pairwise differences among treatments. Similarly, after
conﬁrming assumptions of normality and equal variance, we used ANOVAs to determine
whether any CWM functional traits differed among treatment groups (α = 0.05). When
signiﬁcant differences existed between groups, Tukey HSD was used as a post-hoc test to
determine which treatments differed signiﬁcantly.
Principal components analysis (PCA) ordination was used to visualize how nutrient
enrichment affected community-level variation in CWM functional trait proﬁles (solution
checked using scree plot). CWM traits were standardized to a mean of zero and unit
variance to ensure no single trait would over-inﬂuence plot relationships in the trait space.
We used the envﬁt function in vegan to create a vector overlay of CWM trait values
Diversity 2021, 13, 19
5 of 15
indicating how speciﬁc traits are inﬂuencing plot position in trait space [55]. Centroids
were calculated for each of the convex hulled treatment groups.
Species community composition was visualized using non-metric multidimensional
scaling (NMDS) ordination. We utilized Bray–Curtis distance measure to calculate a
distance matrix of relative species abundance for each treatment replicate. The NMDS was
run to a minimized stress value (stress < 0.2) using 3 dimensions (maximum iteration = 999).
We performed the ordination in the vegan R package [55]. For purposes of interpretation, a
PCA rotation was applied to the ﬁnalized NMDS, such that NMDS axis 1 and 2 represent
maximum variation of the data.
For both trait and species composition analysis, treatment groups were tested using a
permutational MANOVA (PERMANOVA) to determine if nutrient enrichment signiﬁcantly
changed CWM trait and/or species composition [56] (max iteration = 999; α = 0.05).
PERMANOVA makes no assumptions about the distribution of response variables or
dissimilarities and is robust to assess heterogeneity of variances when used on balanced
designs [56]. Post-hoc pairwise testing was conducted to determine which treatments
signiﬁcantly differed in CWM trait composition (α = 0.05, FDR adjustment).
To satisfy assumptions of normality and variance we log transformed our cover data
prior to performing a two-way ANOVA on % cover of graminoid and forb lifeforms among
nutrient treatments (α = 0.05) to determine whether lifeform abundance differed among
communities receiving different nutrient treatments. We found no signiﬁcant lifeform x
treatment interaction, and thus proceeded to testing for signiﬁcant differences of main
effects. Tukey HSD was used as a post-hoc test when appropriate (α = 0.05).
Functional alpha-diversity was calculated as Rao’s quadratic entropy (FDQ). We
selected FDQ because it handles multiple trait variables and aims to estimate species dis-
persion in multidimensional trait space at the plot level, weighting solutions by relative
abundance [57,58]. Functional alpha-diversity indices were calculated using the FD pack-
age [59]. Functional beta-diversity was calculated using betadisper in the R vegan package
which calculates beta dispersion, or the distance of each plot to the mean center of each
treatment group [55]. Beta dispersion tests for homogeneity of group dispersion and is
a common quantitative metric of beta-diversity [60,61]. We used ANOVA (with Tukey
HSD post-hoc) and simple linear regression analysis (α = 0.05) to determine the impact
of nutrients on functional diversity and the relationship between functional diversity and
biomass, respectively.
3. Results
3.1. Biomass Response to Nutrients
Biomass production signiﬁcantly differed among nutrient treatments (Figure 1;
F3, 16 = 18.5, p < 0.0001). Of all the nutrient treatment groups, NP had the highest biomass
production with the lowest biomass production occurring in C and P plots (Figure 1). NP
plots were signiﬁcantly more productive than both P and N plots (Figure 1), suggesting
a nutrient synergistic co-limitation. Although N plots produced lower biomass than NP
plots, we found that mean biomass was still signiﬁcantly higher than P and C plots, with
mean productivity approximately three to four times higher (Figure 1).
3.2. Community-Level Trait Response
3.2.1. Individual Trait Differences Among Treatments
Community-weighted functional traits varied across nutrient treatments. Community-
weighted height was signiﬁcantly different among nutrient treatments (F3, 16 = 72.2,
p < 0.0001), with N and NP plots having the tallest communities on average (Figure 2A).
We found that N and NP fertilization increased community-weighted plant height between
34–55% compared to P and C plots. There was no signiﬁcant treatment effect on SLA
(Figure 2B). Although aboveground tissue in NP plots was enriched in 15N isotope, the
difference was not signiﬁcant compared to C and P plots (Figure 2C). Aboveground tissues
in N plots had enriched 15N isotope levels compared to C and P plots, shifting δ15N from
Diversity 2021, 13, 19

below 0 to above 3 ppt (Figure 2C). Values of foliar %C showed a small but signiﬁcant
increase in N plots compared to C plots (+4.6%, Figure 2D). Leaf %N did not differ among
treatments (Figure 2E).

3.2.2. Trait, Species, and Lifeform Composition
A total of 68.9% of the variation in our data was explained by the functional trait
metrics used in the PCA (PC1 = 40.9%, PC2 = 28.0%). We found that nutrient treatments
resulted in signiﬁcantly different trait-based community composition (Figure 3, PER-
MANOVA: F3, 16 = 4.65, p < 0.001). Trait-based communities of N and NP plots occupied
signiﬁcantly different functional trait space compared to C and P plots, primarily diverging
along PC1 (Figure 3, Table 1). All traits were signiﬁcantly correlated with PC1 and/or PC2
and can be used to indicate how nutrients drive trait-based community position in trait
space (Table S1). For example, height, δ15N, and %C, were strongly correlated with PC1,
indicating plots treated with N/NP are separate from C/P-treated plots because N- and
NP-treated communities are taller and have higher levels of foliar δ15N and %C (Table S1,
Figure 3). Our multivariate analysis shows more clearly how traits like foliar δ15N and
%C impact the dissimilarity of N/NP communities and C/P communities compared to
investigations of these traits using univariate analysis alone. Likewise, SLA had a strong
positive correlation with PC2, while %N and %C had negative correlations with PC2,
inﬂuencing separation of N and NP plots in trait space (Table S1, Figure 3), a pattern that is
not as clear after investigating univariate trait response of SLA, %N, and %C.
Figure 3. Principal components analysis (PCA) of trait-based community composition grouped in
convex hulls by nutrient treatment type on a barrier island grassland community. Points repre-
sent individual experimental plots in functional trait space with asterisks indicating centroids for
each group. Colors and symbols are matched to nutrient treatment (C = control, P = phosphorus,
N = nitrogen, and NP = nitrogen + phosphorus). Centroids can be viewed as mean trait-based
community composition. Vectors indicate functional trait correlations with each axis. Vectors are
labeled with the functional trait they represent, and lengths indicate goodness of ﬁt (Table S1).
Differences in species composition were also found among treatments (Figure S1, PER-
MANOVA: F3, 16 = 4.52, p < 0.001). Species composition was signiﬁcantly different among
all treatments, despite the similarities we ﬁnd in functional composition of N/NP and
C/P communities (Table S2). We also found that, across all treatments, mean graminoid
cover was signiﬁcantly higher than mean forb cover (Figure S2, ANOVA: F3, 16 = 77.65,
p < 0.0001). However, abundance of lifeforms did not differ among communities experienc-
ing different nutrient enrichment treatments (Figure S2; ANOVA: F1, 16 = 0.53, p > 0.05). For
example, graminoid abundance did not differ among treatment groups. These results indi-
cate that trait, species, and lifeform composition provide different perspectives regarding
community-level response to nutrient addition in a coastal mesic grassland.

3.2.3. Trait-Based Alpha and Beta Diversity
Neither functional alpha- nor beta-diversity of trait-based communities were signiﬁ-
cantly different based on nutrient treatment (Figure 4A,B, ANOVA: F3, 16 = 1.42, p = 0.2746
and F3, 16 = 1.91, p = 0.1693, respectively). However, there was a signiﬁcant positive correla-
tion between aboveground biomass and functional alpha-diversity (Figure 4C), while the
relationship between functional beta-diversity and biomass was weak and non-signiﬁcant
(Figure 4D). This pattern indicates that functional alpha-diversity is not so much inﬂu-
enced by nutrient treatment as it is linked to biomass production in each plot, which is
signiﬁcantly higher in N and NP plots (Figure 4C).

4. Discussion
We show the inﬂuence of chronic (3 year) nutrient enrichment on community-level
biomass, speciﬁc functional trait expressions, and trait-based community composition
and diversity in a coastal grassland. It is clear that N enrichment had signiﬁcant impacts
on community biomass production. NP exhibited a synergistic co-limitation effect on
biomass production such that NP treatments produced higher biomass than either N or
P treatments individually. These ﬁndings are consistent with previous studies showing
synergistic nutrient effects in other terrestrial systems [1,9]. However, it is interesting that
P alone had no effect on productivity because it has been shown to increase productivity in
other grassland systems [1]. This is particularly surprising at our grassland site because,
according to our NMDS results, P alters community species composition, even without
evidence of causing differences in productivity or functional trait-based composition. We
found that biomass production in N and NP plots are on average four and seven times
higher than C plots, respectively. This follows global scale trends which indicate that N
and NP deposition increases biomass production by, on average, 18% and 40% compared
to C plots, respectively [1]. Considering the extent of coastal grassland distribution world-
wide, our ﬁndings emphasize the importance of including more coastal grasslands when
investigating response to nutrient enrichment at the global scale.
Our investigation of speciﬁc functional traits shows that some functional trait ex-
pressions associated with competition and altered nutrient acquisition (i.e., height and
δ15N) were signiﬁcantly higher in N and NP plots, similar to other nutrient enrichment
studies [20,62]. Differences in plant height are likely driven by increased competition for
light, as N and NP increase aboveground biomass production [20,62]. It is important to
note that increased height can also be a result of higher N acquisition, allowing for species
to grow more proliﬁcally than if they were in an N-limited environment. We found that
other traits remained unchanged among nutrient enrichment treatments (i.e., %N and
SLA), indicating that certain traits are conserved in coastal systems regardless of nutrient
additions. These trait responses stray from what global patterns have shown, such as
those found by Firn et al. [19], which identify leaf N content as an important indicator of
nutrient inputs. As leaf N was not affected by fertilization, investigating root traits in future
studies may inform aboveground responses. Previous research highlights that increased N
acquisition by roots may affect other functional traits, like δ15N, which correlates with leaf
N content [63].
Foliar δ15N is traditionally used as the primary metric for whole plant δ15N and varies
as a result of multiple environmental changes including N deposition [64]. Increased
availability and uptake of N can result in δ15N enrichment in plant tissues [63,65,66], most
typically through mechanisms of decreasing plant dependence on fungal and microbial
associates to capture and ﬁx N [52,67]. In our study, we found that CWM δ15N values
in C plots was ~0 ppt, which could suggest plants in untreated communities rely on N2
ﬁxation through symbiotic rhizosphere relationships, a mechanism found in the dominant
coastal shrub M. cerifera [68,69]. Symbiotic relationships are an important N acquisition
strategy in N-limited coastal systems [70] and may be disrupted by N additions. While we
did not speciﬁcally test for changes in microbial communities associated with plant root
systems, increased δ15N enrichment has been linked to plant dissociation from N-ﬁxing
bacteria, mycorrhizal fungi, or both when N becomes more readily available during fer-
tilization [71–73]. Previous research has also shown that soil microbial communities can
be directly affected by nutrient inputs [74,75]. If microbial community changes occur in
a way that effectively decreases microbial support to plants, functional trait differences
could emerge as plants compensate for the loss of microbial relationships. Further studies
are necessary to understand how nutrient enrichment impacts microbial communities and
their plant associations in coastal soils.
Surprisingly, we found that different patterns emerged depending on whether we
analyzed trait-based composition, species composition, or lifeform abundance. As hypoth-
esized, trait-based community analysis provided evidence that N and NP treatments ﬁlter
Diversity 2021, 13, 19

trait combinations that favor survival when biomass is high (i.e., in biotically competitive
scenarios). Directional divergence of communities experiencing different nutrient enrich-
ment treatments (in multivariate trait space) indicates the importance of incorporating
multiple aboveground trait combinations when investigating drivers of trait-based com-
munity composition. In contrast with these trait-based patterns, we uncovered distinct
differences in species composition among our nutrient treatments, such that all communi-
ties were signiﬁcantly different from one another, while abundance of different lifeforms
in each treatment community exhibit yet another pattern, in which all treatments were
similar in relative forb and graminoid cover. Contrasting patterns between trait, species,
and lifeform response presents an important complexity that has lacked focus in nutrient
enrichment studies. It is critical to determine how each type of community investigation
technique contributes to our understanding of plant community response to nutrient en-
richment. While we did not speciﬁcally test why these community-level analyses differ
in their response to nutrient enrichment, we recognize that contrasting patterns among
trait, species, and lifeform analyses could be relevant to questions that are currently being
pursued in other investigations of plant community response to nutrient enrichment. For
this reason, we highlight two possible explanations for such community responses below
and encourage future work emphasizing these points.
First, these patterns could indicate that nutrient enrichment inﬂuences functional traits,
species composition, and lifeform abundance independently. For example, it is possible
that functional trait responses would not match species composition changes if nutrient
treatments are not causing complete species turnover. Global change drivers like nutrient
enrichment can inﬂuence species composition in a plethora of ways including species
rank and evenness changes [76]. If differences in species composition among nutrient
treatments are caused by reordering of subordinate species or increased dominance of the
most abundant species, we may not see differences reﬂected in community level functional
traits because the dominant species still contribute most to the community functional trait
expression.
Second, to fully understand how nutrient additions impact plant communities, it
is of interest to determine whether altered functional trait expressions lead to changes
in species composition, or vice versa. In our coastal grassland system, it is possible that
functional traits, species composition, and lifeform abundance may change sequentially.
Such a phenomenon could exist because nutrient additions play a critical role in increasing
biomass production which consequentially changes plant competitive interactions through
modiﬁed functional traits of community members. This mechanism leads to competitive
exclusion of certain species under a new highly productive community, resulting in altered
species composition. However, the inverse relationship could also be true. Nutrients could
reorganize species abundances by opening a niche space for species that would otherwise
be unable to germinate and colonize a given resources space, resulting in new plant species
contributing to community-level functional trait compositions. Given these complexities,
we encourage the use of other community-level functional trait metrics to disentangle
changes in functional trait compositions, like functional alpha- and beta-diversity which
we tested at our coastal grassland site.
We did not ﬁnd that functional alpha-diversity varied signiﬁcantly among nutrient
treatments. However, we did ﬁnd a signiﬁcant positive correlation signifying that func-
tional alpha-diversity is coupled with increased biomass production which is caused by
N and NP enrichment. The coupled response of biomass and functional alpha-diversity
response is likely a critical piece in identifying mechanisms of local-scale co-existence. In
this case, when biomass is high, competitive interactions result in dissimilar trait values for
co-occurring species at the alpha-level [77]. However, it is surprising that the pattern of
increased alpha-diversity was only seen in relation to biomass and not among different
nutrient enrichment treatments. This pattern may indicate an indirect inﬂuence of nutrient
enrichment on functional diversity at the alpha-level. For example, nutrient enrichment
may have an inﬂuence on speciﬁc functional trait responses, but the diversity of traits at
Diversity 2021, 13, 19

the plot level are more inﬂuenced by biomass productivity. This information supports that
functional diversity at the alpha-level can help determine how modiﬁed functional trait
expressions inﬂuence species compositions as varying nutrient treatments increase biomass
production. Similar ﬁndings have been found in other grassland communities [47].
Conclusions and Implications for Coastal Systems
Combined deposition of N and P effectively releases plant communities from an envi-
ronmental ﬁlter (i.e., an abiotic factor inﬂuencing species success/establishment) and drives
feedbacks between altered plant functional trait expressions and community productivity.
As biomass increased with nutrient enrichment, we found functional alpha-diversity also
increased. The positive relationship between functional alpha-diversity and aboveground
biomass may be evidence of a species co-occurrence mechanism stemming from limit-
ing functional trait similarity among species [47]. Limiting similarity of functional traits
between co-occurring species in relatively high productivity environments is a common
mechanism promoting species co-existence [78]. The increase in functional diversity at
the local scale in our system can contribute to our understanding of processes governing
community assembly (i.e., competition vs. environmental ﬁltering), which has not been
comprehensively investigated through manipulation experiments in high-disturbance,
low-productivity coastal systems. Functional alpha-diversity can also specify how envi-
ronmental perturbations relevant to coastal systems (i.e., nutrient enrichment) inﬂuence
community structure and ecosystem functions like productivity and resilience [27,78].
It is important to recognize that while certain individual functional trait responses
may be more uniﬁed in response to nutrient enrichment at global scales, others are likely
driven by overarching environmental variability speciﬁc to certain ecosystem types. For
example, we ﬁnd certain traits (e.g., plant height) follow patterns uncovered in many other
systems [79–81], but traits like leaf N content, SLA, and others, do not follow patterns
seen in other systems or at global scales [3,19,20]. Recognition of site-speciﬁc inﬂuences on
functional trait expressions emphasizes the importance of continued nutrient enrichment
studies across multiple spatial scales.
Understanding mechanisms of trait-based community change by investigating diver-
sity metrics and speciﬁc functional trait expressions sheds light on how low-productivity
coastal systems are affected by recurring nutrient enrichment. Such mechanisms feedback
to vegetative biomass, leading to increased productivity in N and NP plots that are four to
six times higher than C plots. Understanding mechanisms of change and subsequent effects
of nutrient enrichment is especially important in these low-production coastal systems,
as models project increased nutrient loading by 2100 which will increase overall produc-
tivity and ultimately increase coastal resistance at large scales [39,82]. We acknowledge
barrier islands are unique systems and respond individualistically to long- and short-term
environmental forcings across varying spatial scales [37]. However, coastal systems are
increasingly vulnerable to climate-associated disturbance, making it critical to understand
plant community change in response to nutrient enrichment. In order to test our results in
other regions, we encourage the establishment of more nutrient manipulation studies in
low-nutrient coastal grasslands around the globe, especially those located in other barrier
island systems. A higher focus on these areas will lead to better predictions of vegetation
change as nutrient enrichment continues.
