Abstract  
25 
Long-read sequencing has revolutionized genome assembly, yielding highly contiguous, 
26 
chromosome-level contigs. However, assemblies from some third generation long read 
27 
technologies, such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) Continuous Long Reads (CLR), have a high 
28 
error rate. Such errors can be corrected with short reads through a process called polishing. 
29 
Although best practices for polishing non-model de novo genome assemblies were recently 
30 
described by the Vertebrate Genome Project (VGP) Assembly community, there is a need for a 
31 
publicly available, reproducible workflow that can be easily implemented and run on a 
32 
conventional high performance computing environment. Here, we describe polishCLR 
33 
(https://github.com/isugifNF/polishCLR), a reproducible Nextflow workflow that implements best 
34 
practices for polishing assemblies made from CLR data. PolishCLR can be initiated from 
35 
several input options that extend best practices to suboptimal cases. It also provides re-entry 
36 
points throughout several key processes including identifying duplicate haplotypes in 
37 
purge_dups, allowing a break for scaffolding if data are available, and throughout multiple 
38 
rounds of polishing and evaluation with Arrow and FreeBayes. PolishCLR is containerized and 
39 
publicly available for the greater assembly community as a tool to complete assemblies from 
40 
existing, error-prone long-read data.

Main 
43 
Long reads, including those generated by third-generation sequencing platforms such as 
44 
Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT), have revolutionized 
45 
genome assembly (Childers et al., 2021; Hotaling et al., 2021; Rhie et al., 2021). However, until 
46 
recent advances (Hon et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021), long-read sequencing technologies have 
47 
had high error rates (5-15%), especially among indels (Watson & Warr, 2019). Thus, the vast 
48 
majority of long-read data that is currently publicly available yields assemblies with low overall 
49 
consensus accuracy, which, if left uncorrected, negatively impacts downstream analyses, such 
50 
as gene annotation (Watson & Warr, 2019). These assembly errors require correction with an 
51 
additional higher fidelity read set, such as short-read Illumina data, in a process called polishing 
52 
(Chin et al., 2016; Helper et al., 2016; Walker et al., 2014).   
53 
Polishing can be a complex process, with high computational cost, non-trivial file-
54 
handling, and issues around special cases that must be resolved. For example, the long-read 
55 
contig assembly should ideally be polished with high-fidelity reads from the same individual, but 
56 
this may not be technically feasible when sufficient DNA cannot be extracted from individual 
57 
specimens, for example in small-bodied organisms such as many insects. In such cases, it is 
58 
necessary to modify parameters in the standard workflow. Best practices for de novo, 
59 
chromosome-scale vertebrate genome assembly from error prone PacBio continuous long 
60 
reads (CLR) reads were recently described (Rhie et al., 2021), however it can be challenging to 
61 
run this code and reproduce widely. In order to produce the best possible genome assemblies 
62 
using existing data from species regardless of their position in the tree of life, the genome 
63 
assembly community needs a publicly available, flexible and reproducible workflow that is 
64 
containerized so it can be run on any conventional HPC.  
65 
Bioinformatic pipelines with complex entrance and decision points, such as polishing, 
66 
are inherently difficult to track, develop, and debug. Increasing interest in workflow development 
67 
systems that track data and software provenance, enable scalability and reproducibility, and re-

entrant code (Wratten et al., 2021) have led to the development of several workflow languages, 
69 
largely inspired by GNU Make (Amstutz et al., 2016; Köster & Rahmann, 2012; Stallman & 
70 
McGrath, 1991). Nextflow is a Domain Specific Language (Di Tommaso et al., 2017) that 
71 
currently leads workflow systems in terms of ease of scripting and submitting to cloud 
72 
computing resources (Fjukstad & Bongo, 2017; Jackson et al., 2021; Leipzig, 2017; Spjuth et 
73 
al., 2020). A key benefit of Nextflow compared to earlier workflow languages is being able to 
74 
submit jobs to a local machine, an HPC, or cloud-based compute environments. These features 
75 
empower a large range of bioinformatic pipelines, for example, initial read processing and 
76 
annotation lift-over (Federico et al., 2019; Talenti & Prendergast, 2021).  In this paper, we 
77 
describe polishCLR, a reproducible Nextflow workflow which implements the current best 
78 
practices for polishing CLR assemblies and is flexible to multiple input assembly and sample 
79 
considerations.  
80 
The polishCLR workflow can be easily initiated from three input cases (Fig. 1). In the first 
81 
case (Case 1), users may start with an unresolved primary assembly with (e.g., the output of 
82 
FALCON 2-asm (Chin et al., 2016)) or without (e.g., the output of Canu or wtdbg2 (Koren et al., 
83 
2017; Ruan & Li, 2020)) associated contigs. Additionally, it can handle a haplotype-resolved but 
84 
unpolished set (Case 2) (e.g., the output of FALCON-Unzip 3-unzip (Chin et al., 2016)). In the 
85 
ideal case (Case 3), the pipeline is initiated with a haplotype-resolved, CLR long-read polished 
86 
set of primary and alternate contigs (e.g., the output of FALCON-Unzip 4-polish). In all cases, 
87 
inclusion of organellar genomes, e.g., the mitochondrial genome, will improve the polishing of 
88 
nuclear mitochondrial or plasmid pseudogenes (Howe et al., 2021). Organellar genomes should 
89 
be generated and polished separately for best results, using pipelines such as the mitochondrial 
90 
companion to polishCLR, polishCLRmt (Stahlke et al, in prep) or mitoVGP (Formenti et al., 
91 
2021). To allow for the inclusion of scaffolding before final polishing (e.g., Durand et al., 2016) 
92 
and increase the potential for gap-filling across correctly oriented scaffolded contigs, the core 
93 
workflow is divided into two steps, controlled by a --step parameter flag.

In --step 1, if initiating the workflow under Case 1 or 2, unpolished primary contigs are 
95 
merged with the organellar genome and associated contigs or alternate haplotypes if available, 
96 
then polished with a single round of Arrow long-read polishing (Pacific BioScience) before 
97 
entering the core workflow (controlled by --arrow01 true). During Arrow steps (here and later in 
98 
Step 2), polishCLR improves re-entry and computational resource use by delineating at least 
99 
seven Nextflow processes: 1) indexing each contig, 2) creating a pbmm2 index of the assembly, 
100 
3) aligning PacBio reads to the assembly, 4) submitting a GCpp Arrow job for each contig in 
101 
parallel, 5) combining the separate contig variant calling format (VCF) files, 6) reformatting 
102 
Arrow generated VCF for Merfin filtering (Formenti et al., 2021), and 7) converting the resultant 
103 
VCF back to FASTA format. Then, in all three cases, the core workflow employs purge_dups v. 
104 
1.2.5 (Guan et al., 2020) to remove duplicated sequence at the ends of separated primary 
105 
contigs, with cutoffs automatically estimated from a generated histogram of k-mers. The 
106 
histogram is captured as one of the relevant outputs for users to review. Purged primary 
107 
sequences are then concatenated to the alternate haplotype contigs and the combined alternate 
108 
set is purged of duplicates. BUSCO completeness metrics (Manni et al., 2021; Seppey et al., 
109 
2019; Simao et al., 2015; Waterhouse et al., 2018) are generated for the primary contigs before 
110 
and after removing duplicated content to ensure that cutoff parameters are effective and do not 
111 
remove too much genic content. The eukaryotic BUSCO database is used by default, but users 
112 
may provide a designated lineage (controlled by a --busco-lineage flag). If additional data are 
113 
available, this de-duplicated primary contig assembly can then be scaffolded by the user before 
114 
initiating the second phase of the workflow.   
115 
In --step 2, the primary, alternate, and organellar assemblies are merged and polished 
116 
with an additional round of Arrow, followed by two rounds of FreeBayes (Garrison & Marth, 
117 
2012). Indeed, the iterative nature of polishing benefits from the re-entrant caching and 
118 
templates of the workflow. By default, this second round of Arrow-identified variants are only 
119 
filtered via Merfin if the CLR and the Illumina reads came from the same specimen, adding 
120

additional Nextflow processes to the Arrow delineation described above to create a meryl 
121 
genome database and perform filtering (McCartney et. al, unpublished data). However, if short-
122 
read data are from a different specimen than the long-read-based contig assembly, then Merfin 
123 
filtering can be turned off to avoid over-polishing with the parameter flag --same-specimen false. 
124 
As with Arrow, polishCLR takes advantage of Nextflow in seven processes to implement 
125 
FreeBayes: 1) creating contig windows, 2) generating a meryl database from the genome, 3) 
126 
aligning Illumina short reads, 4) polishing via FreeBayes, 5) combining windowed VCF files, 6) 
127 
filtering VCFs by Merfin, 7) and converting VCFs to FASTA. Throughout the polishCLR 
128 
workflow, reports are automatically generated to assess genome assembly quality, including k-
129 
mer based completeness and consensus accuracy QV scores via Merqury (Rhie et al., 2020), 
130 
as well as genome size distribution statistics generated with BBMap (e.g., N50) (Bushnell, 
131 
2014). These reports allow users to understand how the assembly changed through each major 
132 
phase of the workflow. The complete, detailed pipeline can be viewed in Supplemental Figure 1.  
133 
The polishCLR workflow is publicly available (https://github.com/isugifNF/polishCLR), 
134 
reproducible, interoperable, easily portable, and can be run on a conventional HPC or extended 
135 
to cloud computing resources simply by swapping out the Nextflow config file. Software 
136 
dependencies are listed in a conda environment file. Its use has been demonstrated on several 
137 
arthropod species assemblies as part of the Ag100Pest Initiative (Childers et al., 2021). 
138 
Runtimes and summaries from each of the three starting input cases are included 
139 
(Supplementary Table S1; Stahlke and Coates, 2022) with a full genome announcement 
140 
forthcoming (Stahlke et al., unpublished data). The polishCLR workflow will increase the 
141 
efficiency of polishing many genomes and reduce the potential of human error in this multistep 
142 
process. Despite the much-reduced error rate of PacBio HiFi and ONT reads, polishing 
143 
approaches continue to be an important component of accurate genome assembly (Shafin et 
144 
al., 2021). Although this pipeline was not designed to polish with ONT reads, the workflow is 
145 
available on GitHub and welcomes any future contributions.

Figure 1. Diagram of polishCLR workflow for three input cases. Polishing steps 1 and 2 are run 
288 
separately to accommodate an optional scaffolding step. Blue arrows indicate processes while 
289 
black boxes indicate products. The dotted arrow indicates that the manual scaffolding step is 
290 
optional and not within the scope of this pipeline.

Supplemental Table 1. The polishCLR workflow was benchmarked on the primary contigs of 
303 
Helicoverpa zea generated by FALCON (Chin et al. 2016). Metrics for each assembly include 
304 
starting pseudo-haploid primary and alternate combined genome size (Mb) and number of 
305 
contigs, initial quality scores, CPU hours through the pipeline final quality scores, and final 
306 
genome size and number of contigs. This table provides an indication of scalability of the 
307 
pipeline on a SLURM managed HPC.
