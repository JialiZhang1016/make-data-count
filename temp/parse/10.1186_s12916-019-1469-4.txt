Abstract
Background: Heart failure (HF) has been recognized as a global pandemic with a high rate of hospitalization,
morbidity, and mortality. Although numerous advances have been made, its representative molecular signatures
remain largely unknown, especially the role of genes in HF progression. The aim of the present prospective follow-
up study was to reveal potential biomarkers associated with the progression of heart failure.
Methods: We generated multi-level transcriptomic data from a cohort of left ventricular heart tissue collected from
21 HF patients and 9 healthy donors. By using Masson staining to calculate the fibrosis percentage for each sample,
we applied lasso regression model to identify the genes associated with fibrosis as well as progression. The genes
were further validated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining in the same cohort and qRT-PCR using another
independent cohort (20 HF and 9 healthy donors). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to
measure the plasma level in a validation cohort (139 HF patients) for predicting HF progression.
Results: Based on the multi-level transcriptomic data, we examined differentially expressed genes [mRNAs,
microRNAs, and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)] in the study cohort. The follow-up functional annotation and
regulatory network analyses revealed their potential roles in regulating extracellular matrix. We further identified
several genes that were associated with fibrosis. By using the survival time before transplantation, COL1A1 was
identified as a potential biomarker for HF progression and its upregulation was confirmed by both IHC and qRT-
PCR. Furthermore, COL1A1 content ≥256.5 ng/ml in plasma was found to be associated with poor survival within
1 year of heart transplantation from heart failure [hazard ratio (HR) 7.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.5 to 15.8, Log-
rank p value < 1.0 × 10−4].
Conclusions: Our results suggested that COL1A1 might be a plasma biomarker of HF and associated with HF
progression, especially to predict the 1-year survival from HF onset to transplantation.

Background
Heart failure (HF), a chronic condition characterized by
structural and functional impairment of the heart, has been
recognized as a global pandemic and is increasing in preva-
lence [1–3]. During the past decades, the diagnosis of HF
has been mainly based on echocardiography including dila-
tion of left ventricular (LV) and cardiac dysfunction (left
ventricular ejection fraction, or LVEF, < 40%). Regardless of
the etiology, it has shown that the underlying mechanisms
contributing to the progression of HF can lead to stereotyp-
ical changes in gene expression [4]. Therefore, investigation
of transcriptional profiles and related changes may gain
new insights into its molecular mechanisms, helping us de-
velop better diagnostic and prognostic strategies.
Cardiac fibrosis is a requisite component that under-
lies nearly all forms of HF. With the advent of anti-
fibrotic pharmacologic therapies, fibrosis has become an
important therapeutic target in HF patients [5]. More-
over,
fibrosis
disrupts
the
myocardial
architecture,
thereby predisposing the progression of cardiac diseases
to HF [6]. To our knowledge, there have been limited
studies reporting the role of specific fibrosis genes in HF
progression which can be used as biomarkers in diagno-
sis and prognosis. Recent advances in transcriptional
profiling allow us to not only investigate the mRNA
level, but also non-coding RNA including microRNA
(miRNA) and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). Studies
have reported that several mRNAs (e.g., CORIN, CTGF,
and POSTIN), miRNAs (e.g., miR-1, miR-133 and miR-
423-5p), and lnRNAs (e.g., H19 and HOTAIR) might
play roles in the pathogenic mechanisms leading to HF
[7–11]. Although these studies have reported many
promising findings, a systematic investigation of multiple
types of expression and their regulation in HF will likely
reveal more dynamic and regulatory signatures related
to fibrosis in HF, thus helping us better understand the
development and progression of HF.
In this study, we collected the left ventricular tissue from
21 HF patients and 9 healthy donors for whole transcrip-
tome sequencing (mRNA and lncRNA) and small RNA se-
quencing (miRNA). Our functional enrichment analysis of
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed significant
pathways, including extracellular matrix (ECM) that might
play important roles in HF. By constructing the dysfunc-
tional regulatory networks, several miRNAs (e.g., miR-129-
5p and miR-190-5p) and lncRNAs (e.g., BANCR and
PDZRN3-AS1) were pinpointed to be critical in HF. Using a
lasso regression method, several genes, especially ECM-
related genes, were identified to contribute to fibrosis, a
main feature of HF. In particular, an upregulation of
COL1A1 in HF, which was regulated by miRNA miR-190-
5p and lncRNA MSTRG.16534 in our regulatory network,
was found to be related to fibrosis. Interestingly, the
COL1A1 content in plasma was found to contribute to the
progression of HF, suggesting that it might be a potential
plasma biomarker to predict the heart transplantation
(HTx) within 1 year from HF onset. These findings sug-
gested the possible roles of ECM, in particular via a COL1A1
regulatory module, in the progression of HF. The flowchart
of our study is illustrated in Fig. 1.
Methods
Human LV tissue acquisition and RNA extraction
This study complies with the ethical guidelines of the
1975 Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided
written informed consent at the time of enrollment. We
recruited 21 heart failure patient hearts from Fuwai Hos-
pital heart transplantation database with left ventricle
(LV) tissue obtained at the time of HTx and preserved
in liquid nitrogen. The 9 healthy LV heart samples were
obtained from brain-death donors with normal circula-
tory supply, who were not suitable for transplantation
due to the technical or non-cardiac reasons such as
body-weight mismatch by following the guideline of
China Transplant Services. All of patients received
standard drug therapy against HF before HTx [12]. In-
formation of demographic characteristics, comorbidities,
ultrasonic cardiogram, medication, and arrhythmia his-
tory was collected and summarized in Table 1.
The total RNA was extracted from the frozen LV
samples using the Trizol protocol. RNA concentration
was measured using Qubit® RNA Assay Kit in Qubit® 2.0
Flurometer (Life Technologies, CA, USA), and RNA in-
tegrity was assessed using the RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit
of the Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies,
CA, USA). Only RNA samples with a total amount of at
least 6 μg and RNA integrity number (RIN) of at least
6.9 (range 6.9 to 8.5, mean ± SD 7.9 ± 0.4) were used
for subsequent library construction and sequencing
(Additional file 1: Table S1).
RNA library preparation, clustering, and sequencing
A total amount of 3 μg RNA per sample was used as in-
put material for RNA library preparation. First, riboso-
mal RNA was removed by Epicentre Ribo-zero™rRNA
Removal Kit (Epicentre, USA), and rRNA-free residue
was cleaned up by ethanol precipitation. Next, sequen-
cing libraries were generated using the rRNA-depleted
RNA by NEBNext® Ultra™Directional RNA Library Prep
Kit for Illumina® (NEB, USA) following the manufac-
turer’s recommendation. Briefly, fragmentation was car-
ried
out
using
divalent
cations
under
elevated
temperature in NEBNext First Strand Synthesis Reaction
Buffer (5X). First-strand cDNA was synthesized using
random hexamer primer and M-MuLV Reverse Tran-
scriptase (RNaseH−). Second-strand cDNA synthesis was
subsequently performed using DNA Polymerase I and
RNase H. In the reaction buffer, dNTPs with dTTP were

replaced by dUTP. Remaining overhangs were converted
into blunt ends via exonuclease/polymerase activities.
After adenylation of 3′ end of DNA fragments, NEBNext
Adaptor with hairpin loop structure was ligated to pre-
pare for hybridization. To select cDNA fragments of
preferentially 150~200 bp in length, the library frag-
ments were purified with AMPure XP system (Beckman
Coulter, Beverly, USA). Then, 3 μl USER Enzyme (NEB,
USA) was used with size-selected, adaptor-ligated cDNA
at 37 °C for 15 min followed by 5 min at 95 °C before
PCR. PCR was performed with Phusion High-Fidelity
DNA polymerase, Universal PCR primers, and Index (X)
Primer. Finally, the products were purified (AMPure XP
system) and library quality was assessed on the Agilent
Bioanalyzer 2100 system. The clustering of the index-
coded samples was performed on a cBot Cluster Gener-
ation System using TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3-cBot-HS
(Illumia) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
After cluster generation, the libraries were sequenced on
an Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform and 150-bp paired-end
reads were generated.
Small RNA library construction, clustering, and
sequencing
A total amount of 3 μg total RNA per sample was used
as input material for the small RNA library preparation.
Sequencing libraries were generated using NEBNext®
Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina®
(NEB, USA) following the manufacturer’s recommenda-
tion, and index codes were added to attribute sequences
to each sample. Briefly, NEB 3′ SR Adaptor was directly
and specifically ligated to 3′ end of miRNA, siRNA, and
piRNA. After the 3′ ligation reaction, the SR RT Primer
hybridized
to
the
excess
of
3′
SR
Adaptor
(that
remained free after the 3′ ligation reaction) and trans-
formed the single-stranded DNA adaptor into a double-
stranded DNA molecule. This step is important to
prevent adaptor-dimer formation. In addition, dsDNAs
were not substrates for ligation mediated by T4 RNA
Ligase 1 and therefore did not ligate to the 5′ SR
Adaptor in the subsequent ligation step. 5′ end adapter
was ligated to 5′ end of miRNA, siRNA, and piRNA.
Then first-strand cDNA was synthesized using M-MuLV
Reverse Transcriptase (RNase H−). PCR amplification
was performed using LongAmp Taq 2X Master Mix, SR
Primer for Illumina and index (X) primer. PCR products
were purified on an 8% polyacrylamide gel (100 V, 80
min). DNA fragments corresponding to 140~160 bp (the
length of small non-coding RNA plus the 3′ and 5′
adaptors) were recovered and dissolved in 8 μl elution
buffer. Finally, library quality was assessed on the Agi-
lent Bioanalyzer 2100 system using DNA High Sensitiv-
ity Chips. The clustering of the index-coded samples
was performed on a cBot Cluster Generation System
using TruSeq SR Cluster Kit v3-cBot-HS (Illumia) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. After cluster generation,

the libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq 2500
platform and 50 bp single-end reads were generated.
Heart failure validation cohort
To validate whether the COL1A1 content in plasma
would be used as a biomarker for HF progression, we re-
cruited 139 samples from an independent heart failure
cohort in Fuwai Hospital. These patients were qualified
heart failure diagnosis and received HTx. In selection of
validation samples, those patients were excluded if they
were combined with any of the following conditions: (1)
hepatitis virus positive such as HBV and HCV, (2) liver
cirrhosis or liver cancer, (3) pulmonary fibrosis or mye-
lofibrosis, (4) malignant tumor, or (5) other system
diseases. In addition, all the patients had standard medi-
cation treatment without mitral valve modeling. The
blood samples of these patients were collected and pre-
served before HTx.
Histology, electron microscopy, and Masson analysis
To calculate the fibrosis percentage for each sample, tis-
sue processing, section making, HE staining, and Masson
trichrome staining were performed according to the pre-
viously published procedures [13]. All of the staining
sections were scanned as digital images by a slice scan-
ner to further analysis [14]. We performed the Masson
analysis by calculating percentages of tissue components
with hue, saturation, and intensity independently by
three researchers at least one time per person. In each
whole section, five randomly selected fields were evalu-
ated under microscope (× 200) from epicardial to endo-
cardial region per whole slice, with excluding trabecular
and scar tissue [15].
Besides, the ultrathin section of transplanted heart tis-
sue was described briefly as follows: both ventricles of
transplanted heart tissue were routinely fixed in 2.5%
glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M/L phosphate buffer (pH 7.3) and
post-fixed in buffered 1% osmium tetroxide. Then, the
images
were
acquired
by
transmission
electron
microscope.
Data pre-processing, de novo assembly, and annotation
The raw sequence reads of mRNA/lncRNA were cleaned
by removing the RNA adapters and trimming the low-
quality bases (Q < 20). For mRNA-seq, approximately
1.33 billion clean reads were generated after removing
the adapter by Cutadapt program (version 1.9). Among
all the clean reads, more than 97.60% had the Phred-like
quality score at the Q20 level (an error probability of
1%). RNA sequencing tags were only considered when
they mapped to the same DNA strand as indicated by
GRCh38.p11 annotation using HISAT2 (version 2.1.0)
[16]. After assembly, approximately 96.74% of the total
clean reads were mapped to the reference transcriptome.
The fragments per kilobase of transcript per million
mapped reads (FPKM) value of 186,363 transcripts was
calculated based on StringTie (version 1.3.4) with default
parameters [16]. mRNA with low expression were ex-
cluded, defined as those with FPKM less than 1 in more
than 80% samples. For lncRNAs, we did not remove the
low expressed transcripts, while we identified the poten-
tial long non-coding transcripts by filtering out short
transcripts (default 200 nt) and removing single exon
transcripts based on the FEELnc tool (version 0.11-2)
[17]. The remaining transcripts were then used to per-
form the following analysis.

For miRNAs, mature miRNA and precursor miRNAs
of human were obtained from miRBase (Release 22)
[18]. The reads were first subjected to adapter removal
through the Cutadapt program. Approximately 609.59
million clean reads were obtained after removing the
adapters and further pre-processed by miRDeep2 [19].
The known mature miRNA expression profile was gen-
erated by using the quantifier module of the miRDeep2
package that gives the read counts for the known miR-
NAs. Specifically, 479.49 million reads (78.70%) were
mapped to
mature
human
miRNAs. For the pre-
processing of miRNA data, we removed miRNAs with a
missing value in > 10% of the samples. According to the
miRNA sequence database miRBase [20] (Release 22),
there were 2620 mature human miRNAs. Our analysis
resulted in 604 expressed miRNAs in our samples.
Identification of differentially expressed mRNAs, miRNAs,
and lncRNAs
The differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs be-
tween the samples with and without HF were detected
by Ballgown (version 2.16.0) [16] based on the expres-
sion levels obtained from StringTie with threshold of ad-
justed p value less than 0.05. We further required the
DEGs or DElncs to have more than twofold changes.
Similarly, the DEmiRs were obtained by using DEseq2
(version
1.24.0)
[21]
R
package
with
Benjamini-
Hochberg (BH) [22] adjusted p value less than 0.05 and
more than twofold changes.
We performed functional enrichment analysis of the
DEGs using the online tool WebGestalt (2019 version)
[23]. We used all the genes only detected in our study as
the reference geneset. The pathways and GO terms with
adjusted p value < 0.05 were considered being statisti-
cally enriched. To better interpret the results, we con-
structed a DEG GO term associated network by using
the plugin module ClueGO [24] in Cytoscape [25] with
the default parameters. In this network, a node repre-
sents a gene or a term while an edge indicates that a
gene belongs to a term. To investigate the functions of
the DElncs, we identified their potential targets based on
the FEELnc tool with default parameter since classifying
lncRNAs with mRNAs could help predict the functions
of lncRNAs [17]. For the DEmiRs, we performed micro-
RNA Enrichment Analysis and Annotation (miEAA)
with Over Representation Analysis (ORA) [26] to detect
the significantly enriched categories. The adjusted p
value cutoff was set to 0.05.
Construction of regulatory network for HF
To construct the miRNA-gene regulatory network, the
target genes of miRNAs were collected from both com-
putational prediction and experimental validation. Three
computational methods were employed to predict the
target genes of miRNAs, including PITA [27], miRanda
(August 2010 Release) [28], and TargetScan (Release 7.1)
[29]. We selected the miRNA and target gene pairs sup-
ported by at least two tools to avoid false positives [30].
We further collected experimentally determined miRNA
target genes deposited in miRTarBase (Release 7.0) [31].
In total, a set of 502,768 miRNA-gene interactions in-
volving 2600 miRNA and 16,732 genes were obtained.
To build the miRNA-DEG regulatory network, we con-
sidered only the DEmiRs as they were more likely to be
related to HF. Furthermore, we required the miRNAs to
be negatively correlated with the target genes (all were
DEGs in this analysis) or regulate DEGs through its tar-
get genes. The relationship was measured by the Spear-
man’s correlation coefficient (p value< 0.05) in the HF
samples.
Similarly, we constructed a lncRNA-gene interaction
network by including DElncs and their co-expressed
DEGs (p value< 0.05 for Spearman’s correlation coeffi-
cient). This was built on the assumption that lncRNAs
may regulate their target genes, although they may not
directly bind to the genes [32].
Identification of fibrosis-related genes based on lasso
regression
To identify the genes that were most associated with fi-
brosis, we fitted a lasso regression model for feature se-
lection. We used the gene expression as the exposure
variable and the fibrosis percentage for each sample as
the response variable. By applying to our dataset, it
would pick up a group of genes whose expression profile
could best explain the fibrosis level in HF patients. Here,
the percentage of fibrosis was calculated following the
method in Ref. [13]. Among the 21 HF samples, 18 had
the data for the percentage of fibrosis.
In this study, we applied the Python package scikit-learn
(version 0.20.0) to solve the problem mentioned above.
Immunohistochemical analysis of COL1A1
Immunohistochemical staining of COL1A1 was per-
formed according to the following protocol. Formalin
fixed
paraffin-embedded
sections
of
LV
were
dewaxed by methanol, subjected to antigen retrieval
(heat
mediation
in
an
EDTA
buffer,
pH = 9.0),
blocked for 30 min, incubated at 4 °C overnight with
anti-collagen I antibody at 1:200 dilution (Abcam,
ab34710), then incubated at room temperature with
a secondary antibody: HRP conjugated rabbit IgG.
The whole slice was scanned by a digital scanner,
and the COL1A1-positive area within the slice was
calculated by Image-Pro Plus Version 6.0 (Media
Cybernetics).

Validation of COL1A1 expression by quantitative real-time
PCR (qRT-PCR)
Total RNA was extracted according to the Trizol proto-
col while complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized
by PrimeScript RT Master Mix kit (Takara, RR036A).
Each cDNA was diluted by 20 folds and then used as a
template for qRT-PCR assay using SYBR Green Master
Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A25742). The qRT-PCR
was performed in a 10 μl reaction volume by Applied
Biosystems®ViiA7 Real-Time Thermo Fishers (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, USA). Three technical replicates were
assayed for each reaction. The procedure for qRT-PCR
was as follows: 30 s at 95 °C for denaturation, followed
by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 20 s and 72 °C for
20 s. The relative expression value of the selected genes
was calculated using the 2−ΔΔCT method in the Applied
Biosystems®ViiA7 Real-Time PCR Systems. The primers
of COL1A1 were F: 5′-GATTCCCTGGACCTAAAG
GTGC-3′
and
R:
5′-AGCCTCTCCATCTTTGCC
AGCA-3′.
The
primers
for

Quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
Frozen plasma samples that were stored in a −80 °C
freezer were quickly thawed at 37 °C, followed by putting
on ice. Human COL1A1 ELISA kit (Abcam, ab210966)
was used to analyze plasma samples. All procedures were
performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Results
Clinical and pathological description of the study cohort
All the enrolled patients in this study were collected
from Fuwai Hospital heart transplantation database, in-
cluding 21 HF patients and 9 healthy donors. The base-
line
demographic and
clinical
characteristic of the
patients and healthy donors are summarized in Table 1.
Patients in our study were diagnosed by clinical and
pathological performance: 18 of them were diagnosed as
dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and the remaining 3 as
myocarditis. All patient presenting end-stage HF were
treated with standard medication treatment before HTx.
The mean ± standard deviation (SD) age was 34.6 ± 15.9.
Among them, 61.9% of the patients were men and 90.5%
of the patients were with NYHA class III (n = 7, 33.3%)
or IV (n = 12, 57.1%). Most patients (n = 19, 90.5%) had
reduced LVEF (< 40%), and only 1 patient had HF with a
preserved LVEF (≥50%). LVEF was not available for one
patient (4.8%) and the LVEF ± SD was 27.6 ± 9.8%. Few
patients (n = 2, 9.5%) had diabetes mellitus history, five
patients (23.8%) had smoking history, and some patients
(n = 5, 23.8%) companied with pulmonary hypertension.
Since the ventricle had enlarged, some patients were
with different extent of regurgitation of tricuspid or
mitral, or both. Six patients (n = 6, 28.6%) had premature
ventricular contraction and most patients had been
treated with diuretic (n = 18, 85.7%), ACEI/ARB (n = 17,
81.0%), digoxin (n = 16, 76.2%), or β-blocker (n = 15,
71.4%). All healthy donors were males with the mean ±
SD age being 41.7 ± 4.0, which was not significantly dif-
ferent from that of the heart failure patients (41.7 ± 4.0
vs. 34.6 ± 15.9, t test p value = 0.07). The sex was not sig-
nificantly different between heart failure patients and
healthy donors [13(61.9%) vs. 9(100%), Fisher’s exact test
p value = 0.07]. In addition, the LVEF of healthy donors
was required more than 60% before the donation. The
detailed clinical information can be found in Add-
itional file 1: Table S1.
As shown in Fig. 2a, b, the LV dilatation and dysfunc-
tion, evaluated by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR),
were found to occur frequently. In addition, fibrosis in
different regions of the LV was found in late gadolinium
enhancement (Fig. 2b). Figure 2 c–f show typical patho-
logical characteristics in a HF sample (sample ID: S16).
The end-stage HF patients were characteristic with the
dilated ventricle cavity (Fig. 2c). Typical features of the
heart tissue that underwent HF included different de-
grees of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and sarcoplasmic
degenerative changes such as the appearance of vacuoli-
zation (Fig. 2d). Massive fibrosis was found around the
interstitial or perivascular regions (Fig. 2e). The ultra-
structure
performance
also
indicated
myofilament
changes that were apparent in degenerated cardiomyo-
cytes (Fig. 2f).
The transcriptomic landscape of HF
RNA-seq data process, quality check, and analysis were
described in “Methods”. The detailed sequence statistics,
including number of reads, alignment, and mapping in-
formation for each sample were summarized in Add-
itional file 2: Table S2. In this study, we refer mRNA to
protein-coding gene and lncRNA for long non-coding
gene (Table 2). As shown in Fig. 3a–c, principal compo-
nent analysis (PCA) was first performed for the expres-
sion profiles of mRNAs, lncRNAs, and miRNAs. All
three RNA types could largely distinguish HF patients
from healthy controls. Interestingly, lncRNA expression
profiles had the best performance in distinguishing HF
from healthy controls, reinforcing the importance to fur-
ther investigate their underlying mechanism in HF. In
Fig. 3d–f, volcano plots showed downregulated (blue
nodes) and upregulated (red nodes) genes. We identified
126 mRNAs, 16 lncRNAs, and 42 miRNAs that were dif-

revealed a distinct expression signature of HF compared to
healthy samples as shown in Fig. 3g–i. It is suggested that
HF samples had distinct transcriptomic changes at multiple
molecular levels when compared to control samples.
We further performed the functional enrichment ana-
lysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Several
well-known diseases related to HF were significantly
enriched, such as cardiovascular disease (BH adjusted p
value = 7.13 × 10−11) and vascular diseases (BH adjusted
p value = 6.72 × 10−11) as shown in Fig. 4a (Detailed in-
formation was shown in Additional file 3: Table S3).
Among the significantly enriched Gene Ontology (GO)
Biological Process (BP) pathways, some fibrosis-related
terms stood out, such as extracellular matrix (GO:
0031012) (BH adjusted p value = 1.55 × 10−15) and regu-
lation of blood pressure (BH adjusted p value = 4.10 ×
10−7) [33, 34]. To better interpret the results, we con-
structed a DEG GO term network (Fig. 4b). From this
network, it would be interesting to see those genes
associated
with
multiple
terms,
especially
multiple
categories defined by GO terms in a parent-child relation-
ship. In our network, the gene POSTN was involved in 17
terms (degree = 17) in five categories. POSTN is critical in
cardiac development and remodeling, and the expression
was found to be consistent with the percentage of myocar-
dial fibrosis [35]. Hence, genes with a high degree in this
network might provide promising candidates for further
investigation, such as ACE2, KLF4, JAK2, and NR4A3.
To
investigate
the
function
of
the
differentially
expressed lncRNAs and miRNAs (hereafter, we abbrevi-
ated as DElncs and DEmiRs), we identified their poten-
tial targets. The detail information of the DElncs is
provided in Additional file 4: Table S4. In total, we iden-
tified 15 potential target genes for 15 DElncs through
126 interactions. Among them, some have been already
reported to be involved in cardiac diseases, such as
CORIN and EGLN3 [36, 37]. For the DEmiRs, 21 miR-
NAs have been reported to be associated with the

development of HF according to the Human microRNA
Disease Database (HMDD) [38]. We further used micro-
RNA Enrichment Analysis and Annotation (miEAA)
[26] to detect the significantly enriched categories. As
shown in Additional file 5: Table S5, several enriched
pathways were related to HF [26]. Taken together, these
findings may indicate the potential roles of the DElncs
and DEmiRs in the development of HF.
Regulatory network analysis revealed novel signatures
of HF
With the HF-associated coding mRNA and non-coding
RNA molecules from the above analyses, we next con-
structed miRNA-mRNA and lncRNA-mRNA regulatory
networks in order to identify novel regulators in the devel-
opment of HF. Here, we only focused on the regulation be-
tween
differentially
expressed
mRNAs,
lncRNAs,
and
miRNAs since they are more likely to play important roles
in HF.
For DEGs and DEmiRs, the regulatory network com-
prised 18 DEmiRs and 63 DEGs through 86 regulatory
interactions (Fig. 5a). Since ECM-associated terms are
associated with fibrosis and highly significantly enriched
in DEGs, we particularly examined the regulator cross-
talk associated with ECM. We found that miR-1-3p,
miR-155-5p, miR-190a-5p, and miR-548ar-3p associated
with fibrotic genes such as COL1A1, COL14A1, and
COLQ. Among them, miR-190a-5p (downregulated in
HF samples) regulated the largest number (n = 16) of up-
regulated DEGs, most of which are involved in ECM,
suggesting miR-190a-5p may be a main regulator in
ECM associated with HF.
In addition to the miRNA regulatory network, the dys-
regulation of lncRNA expression is known to be associ-
ated with various diseases. Therefore, we constructed a

these lncRNAs, LOC101926975, LOC101927179, and
MSTRG.16534 were found to interact with multiple
DEGs, suggesting that they might have important regula-
tory roles in HF. Interestingly, the lncRNA MSTRG.16534
was associated with multiple ECM-related genes in the
network, and most of these ECM genes were also
regulated by miR-190a-5p. These results reinforced the
important roles of ECM in the development of HF, sug-
gesting that miR-190-5p and MSTRG.16534 might have
synergistic regulatory roles in the molecular mechanism
of HF.
As previous studies have reported that lncRNA could
compete with miRNA and regulate miRNA-mediated
target
repression,
we
next
constructed
a
miRNA-
lncRNA-mRNA co-regulatory network. We required
that miRNAs and lncRNAs have significant expression
relationships based on Spearman’s correlation coefficient

(p value < 0.05). We investigated the co-regulatory net-
work to examine whether such co-regulations have im-
portant roles in HF. As a result, we identified several
feed-forward loops (FFLs) potentially associated with HF
[39]. For example, two genes ABAT and PTGDS, which
were associated with multiple HF-related pathways such
as regulation of blood pressure and positive regulation
of muscle contraction [40], were jointly regulated by
miR-129-5p and LOC101927179 as shown in Fig. 5c.
The miR-129-5p was reported to be upregulated in peri-
toneal dialysis and was suggested to be a potential thera-
peutic target for the amelioration of peritoneal fibrosis
in peritoneal dialysis [41].
Collectively, our regulatory network analysis identified
many potential modules and molecules that might play
important roles in HF development, especially fibrosis.
Among them, ECM genes and their miRNA and lncRNA
regulators are promising markers in HF.
Identifying myocardial fibrosis genes based on lasso
regression
Based on the results mentioned above, ECM and its re-
lated genes were indicated to play important roles in the
development of HF while ECM is a driver of progressive
fibrosis. Here, we attempted to detect fibrosis-related
genes, aiming to provide new insights into the ventricu-
lar function in HF patients. Among the 21 HF patients,
18 had available data for the percentage of fibrosis
(Additional file 6: Table S6, Fig. 6a). This clinical data
was used for the following analysis.
We collected three sets of genes to investigate the rela-
tionship between these genes and fibrosis. These are
genes previously implicated in HF, including DEGs,
GWAS genes, and HF-related genes reported in litera-
tures and available from GeneCards [42]. Figure 6b
shows the distribution of Spearman’s correlation coeffi-
cient for each gene with fibrosis. We also included a set
of random genes with the same size of DEGs. As shown
in Fig. 6b, DEGs had the highest correlation with fibrosis
compared to GWAS genes and the HF-related genes.
Next, we applied the lasso regression to the DEGs to de-
tect fibrosis-related genes.
By fitting a lasso regression model, we found 33 out of
the 126 DEGs to be associated with fibrosis (non-zero
coefficients), denoted as fibrosis-associated genes (Fig. 6c,
Additional file 7: Table S7). Among these 33 candidate
genes, we found several genes that were previously im-
plicated in HF, such as NPPA (already well known for
HF) and FSTL3 (an extracellular regulator in heart [43]).
Another gene is COL1A1 which had upregulated in our
study. The overexpression COL1A1 was reported to be
highly correlated with liver fibrosis [44]. Furthermore,
39.39% (13 out of 33) of the fibrosis-associated genes
were included as informative genes which were defined
as genes involved in pathway enrichment (Fisher’s exact
test, p value = 1.05 × 10−26). Our functional enrichment
analysis of these 33 fibrosis-associated genes revealed that
they were significantly enriched in extracellular space (p
value = 3.67 × 10−9), extracellular region (p value = 3.35 ×
10−7), and extracellular matrix (p value = 6.05 × 10−6). It is
well known that ECM components are subject to modulate
the proliferation, migration, and activation of cardiac fibro-
sis. These results further supported that ECM might play a
major role in the development of cardiac diseases, especially
the fibrosis in HF.
COL1A1 as a potential fibrotic marker for HF progression
Since HF is largely a consequence of increased myocar-
dial stiffness caused by excessive cardiac fibrosis, the
percentage of the fibrosis can affect the survival of the
patients. Here, we collected the time period of each pa-
tient from initial symptoms to heart transplantation
(HTx) and from HF onset to HTx, respectively (Add-
itional file 6: Table S6). In this study, the event of HTx
was of our interest and we referred the survival time as
the time from initial symptoms to HTx or the time from
HF onset to HTx, respectively.
Based on the Pearson’s correlation coefficient between
gene expression and survival information in HF samples,
we identified four fibrosis-associated genes to be signifi-
cantly associated with survival rate. These genes were
ASPN, COL1A1, COLQ, and IGFBP3. We then applied
the Kaplan-Meier test to estimate the relationship be-
tween survival data and the expression level of these
genes by separating patients into two groups (one group
with expression ≥median and the other with < median).
As shown in Fig. 6d, e, only one gene, COL1A1, showed
a negative correlation with both types of survival status
(p value = 6.1 × 10−3 for initial symptoms to HTx and p
value = 0.04 for HF onset to HTx). This is consistent
with the observation that the expression of COL1A1 was
positively correlated with fibrosis and the patients with a
high COL1A1 expression needed HTx in a much shorter
period than those with a low COL1A1 expression. These
results further implied that COL1A1 represents a fibrosis
signature and is associated with HF progression. Due to
the relatively small number of samples, this finding war-
rants further validation.
Experimental validation of COL1A1 as a potential
biomarker in HF progression
HTx has been the most efficient treatment for end-stage
HF. However, there is very limited finding regarding the
biomarkers for the survival from HF onset to HTx. Our
results revealed that COL1A1 was potentially associated
with fibrosis and might be a novel biomarker for HF
progression.
To
further
validate
results
mentioned
above, we performed the immunohistochemistry (IHC)

Page 11 of 16
staining assay of the left ventricles in the analysis cohort.
Among our 30 samples, only 21 HF samples and 6 nor-
mal samples could be further used for the IHC staining
assay (Fig. 7a). Based on the quantitative analysis of
COL1A1-positive area in the whole slice prepared by
Imge-Pro
Plus,
we
found
that
the
proportion
of
COL1A1-positive area in HF was much larger than
normal control (13.61 ± 2.55% vs. 3.76 ± 0.64%, t-test p
value = 1.1 × 10−3, Fig. 7b). To further validate the ex-
pression of COL1A1 as a marker in HF versus normal
controls, we performed the quantitative real-time PCR
(qRT-PCR) assay of the COL1A1 gene expression in an
independent cohort including 20 HF samples and 9 nor-
mal controls. As shown in Fig. 7c, the relative expression
of COL1A1 showed significantly higher expression in HF
samples than normal controls (4.07 ± 0.48 vs. 1.13 ± 0.22,
t-test p value = 4.1 × 10−4). Taken together, both IHC
and qRT-PCR validation data supported that COL1A1
was significantly upregulated in HF samples from patho-
logical and gene transcription aspects.
Based on the previous studies, plasma biomarkers can
offer great promise to further dissect the underlying dis-
ease processes, which are important in diagnosis, prog-
nosis, and HF treatment [45, 46]. Thus, we attempted to
investigate whether the COL1A1 content in plasma
would be used as a biomarker for HF progression. We
then examined the plasma COL1A1 content in another
and a larger cohort comprising 139 HF patients, with

each patient having the corresponding progression
data from HF to HTx. Here, the plasma COL1A1
content
was
evaluated
based
on
ELISA
(see
“Methods”). By calculating the Pearson’s correlation
coefficient between plasma COL1A1 content and HF
survival time, we found they were significantly anti-
correlated with each other (Pearson’s correlation coef-
ficient r = −0.3382, p value < 1.0 × 10−4).
The patients who progressed to HTx rapidly within 1 year
is more clinically important. To examine the difference, we
separated the 139 HF patients into two groups: those from
HF onset to HTx within 1 year (n = 29) and those from HF
onset to HTx by longer than 1 year (n = 110). Furthermore,
we used this dataset as gold standard. After obtaining the
plasma COL1A1 content, we can define a plasma COL1A1
content threshold for the patients being transplanted within
1 year versus longer than 1 year. In addition, the diagnostic
efficiency of plasma COL1A1 expression level for survival
from HF onset to HTx was also calculated. As shown in
Fig. 7d, the plasma COL1A1 content could distinguish 1-
year HTx group with an AUC (area under the ROC curve)
score of 0.789 (cutoff value = 256.5 ng/ml, p value < 1.0 ×
10−4), in comparison with 0.656 for 3-year HTx and 0.624
for 5-year HTx. These results further suggested that plasma
COL1A1 content greater than 256.5 ng/ml in plasma was
statistically associated with poor survival within 1 year [haz-
ard ratio (HR) 7.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.5 to 15.8,
Log-rank p value < 1.0 × 10−4, Fig. 7e]. Taken together, our
data indicated that the plasma COL1A1 content (greater
than 256.5 ng/ml) might be used as a potential biomarker
of HF progression, especially 1 year after onset of HF.
Discussion
HF is a clinical syndrome caused by structural and func-
tional defects in the myocardium resulting in impair-
ment of ventricular filling or the ejection of blood. It has
been defined as a global pandemic, and its prevalence
has been increased recently, with a high rate of the asso-
ciated hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality [1–3]. So
far, a standardized medical treatment has been success-
ful in the early stages of HF. However, pharmacological
management has a limited role in advanced HF cases.
Therefore, further studies are needed to develop novel
therapeutic agents, such as regenerative and gene therapy.
This requires a deep understanding of the molecular
mechanisms underlying HF development and progression.
Since it is very difficult to obtain clinical patient sam-
ples with advanced HF for molecular mechanistic stud-
ies, most investigations on HF have applied animal
disease models to explore the molecular mechanism of
HF. In our study, we collected heart tissues from 21 HF
patients and 9 healthy donors instead of using blood
samples. We further performed a systematic investiga-
tion
of
the
gene
expression
changes
at
multi-
transcriptional levels and regulatory networks including
mRNAs, lncRNAs, and miRNAs for HF patients. Ac-
cording to PCA analysis, HF and control samples were
better distinguished by lncRNA expression than mRNA

and miRNA expression. Although it is preliminary, this
observation might motivate us to find potential lncRNA
biomarkers for diagnose and prognosis of HF in future.
So far, the knowledge of lncRNA in HF has been very
limited. Besides, we did not collect more clinical infor-
mation except sex and age of the healthy donors for the
DE analysis in the present work. If we could collect
more detailed information of healthy donors such as
smoking and drinking, we could correct for performing
DE analysis.
With the advent of anti-fibrotic pharmacologic therap-
ies, fibrosis has become an important therapeutic target
in HF. Thus, understanding the mechanisms contribut-
ing to fibrosis will help us identify therapeutic targets. In
this study, we identified several genes associated with fi-
brosis, some of which have been reported in literature,
such as ELN and POSTN [47, 48]. In addition, we identi-
fied several novel fibrosis associated genes for further
validation, such as NR4A3, PTGDS, TNC, miR-190a, and
miR-708-5p. For example, a previous study reported that
PTGDS could mediate biosynthesis of PGD2 to promote
cardiomyocyte survival [49]. This might imply that
PTGDS gene identified in our study could serve as a po-
tential therapeutic target for HF treatment. Furthermore,
our network analysis revealed that microRNA: mir-129-
5p and lncRNA: LOC101927179 might regulate the ex-
pression of PTGDS in the same network, which was as-
sociated with fibrosis (Fig. 6c) and the survival rate
(Additional file 7: Table S7). Our results also consist-
ently indicated that ECM was enriched among DEGs
and fibrosis-related genes, suggesting that ECM is one
major mechanism contributing to fibrosis.
The persistence of myocardial fibrosis will lead to the
development of adverse changes in ventricular structure,
eventually leading to the progression to HF. Although
transcriptomic approaches have been applied to identify
genes involved in the fibrotic process in previous studies,
the specific fibrosis-related genes in HF development
and further contributed to the HF progression is still not
well known. With the survival rate and gene expression
data in this study, we identified a fibrosis-associated
gene, COL1A1, that was significantly associated with HF
progression. By performing IHC and qRT-PCR experi-
ments, the expression of COL1A1 was validated to be
highly upregulated in the HF samples. We were able to
further investigate COL1A1 content in plasma by using
another 139 HF samples. And we found that higher ex-
pression level of COL1A1 in plasma was associated with
poor survival from HF to HTx (Fig. 7e). To our know-
ledge, this is the first report to specify fibrotic gene asso-
ciated with HF progression. It is known that HF is
heterogeneous with different time from HF onset to
HTx ranging from 30 days to more than 5 years [50].
The plasma biomarkers might provide great promise to
further dissect the underlying disease processes. Our re-
sults indicated that the plasma COL1A1 content could
be a potential biomarker to distinguish the malignant
process of HF within 1-year after HF diagnosis with
higher diagnostic efficiency than longer survival condi-
tion (Additional file 8: Table S8). It will be helpful to as-
sess the HF patient regarding longer survival, as well as
to alleviate the overload of HF. It is important to further
study the mechanistic role of COL1A1 in fibrosis. There
are some reports of the association between COL1A1
and fibrosis in HF based on the mouse model or in other
diseases such as liver cancer [51–53]. In the present
work, we validated this relationship at the transcriptomic
level in the human heart tissue. Instead of further inves-
tigating how COL1A1 leads to fibrosis, we focused on
the potential role of COL1A1 in HF progression. Such
finding is much needed for clinical studies in heart
transplantation.
Readers should take caution of the results in our study
because the sample size is still relatively small. We used
30 patients (21 HF and 9 healthy donors, all heart tissue
samples) for discovery by a multi-omics approach. Our
top gene (COL1A1) identified in the 30 discovery cohort
samples was further validated by immunohistochemistry
staining in the same cohort and qRT-PCR using another
independent cohort (20 HF and 9 healthy donors), and an
additional 139 cohort patients for evaluation of plasma
COL1A1 content. This size of the heart failure cohort for
potential biomarker discovery is smaller than some of the
previous studies of HF [54, 55]. It is due to the fact that all
the HF patients, including the 139 HF cohort, received
heart transplantation, which is different from the previous
studies [55]. Considering this limitation, our findings need
further validation by recruiting more HF patients with re-
lated clinical data and additional functional work to illus-
trate specific roles of plasma COL1A1 level on HF
progression in the future. Furthermore, most HF patients
included in the study for multi-transcriptomic analysis
were young (mean age 34.6), and much younger than the
general patient population. Our preliminary analysis did
not find any significant difference by checking family his-
tory and etiology of these HF patients. Since most HF pa-
tients are older than our samples, the results in this study
might include some unique features of this specific popu-
lation and further investigation is warranted in future.
Moreover, we found that there were two HFpEF samples
in our study cohort. In future, when there is larger cohort
and more comprehensive data available, we will extend
the study of mechanism of early-onset and late-onset HF
as well as the different subtypes of HF.

explored a co-regulatory network using differentially
expressed mRNAs, miRNAs, and lncRNAs. Our network
analysis not only provided a high-level view of the func-
tional changes but also pinpointed several critical regula-
tors. By examining the relationship between fibrosis
percentage and gene expression, we identified several
genes and their regulatory networks that might be re-
lated to fibrosis. Furthermore, the fibrosis associated
gene COL1A1 was found to be associated progression of
HF. COL1A1 content in plasma could be used as a po-
tential biomarker for HF progression, especially for pre-
dicting the 1-year survival from HF onset to HTx.
