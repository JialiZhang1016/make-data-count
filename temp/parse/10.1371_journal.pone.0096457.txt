Abstract
The present study examined intergroup judgments made between four groups of non-meat eaters: health vegetarians;
ethical vegetarians; health vegans, and ethical vegans. Consistent with hypotheses based on horizontal hostility and the
need to maintain ingroup distinctiveness, ethical vegetarians gave unfavorable evaluations to health vegetarians relative to
vegans, especially when the mainstream omnivore group was made salient. Contrary to expectations, vegans gave relatively
more favorable evaluations to ethical vegetarians than health vegetarians when mainstream salience was low. This was
especially true for vegans who were motivated primarily by ethical concerns. When mainstream salience was high, vegans
did not distinguish between the vegetarian subgroups. Results suggest that one’s motives for abstaining from meat often
play a larger role in this type of intergroup perceptions than one’s dietary practices.

Introduction
Despite increasing claims the last decade that meat consump-
tion harms the environment, personal and public health, and
animals [1], vegetarianism still remains a relatively infrequent
practice in the U.S., accounting for 3% of the population [2].
Estimates in other western nations are generally low as well,
ranging from 9% in Germany to less than 2% in Denmark and
France [3].
Despite being relatively small, there is quite a bit of dietary
variation within this minority population. Divisions based on diet
include: semi-vegetarians, which include pescetarians and pollo-
tarians; ovo, lacto, and ovo-lacto vegetarians; vegans; and
fruitarians. The present work is concerned with how favorably
non-meat eating subgroups perceive each another. Theoretically,
this provides an opportunity to test a framework explicating
relations between multiple minority groups. From a practical
perspective, for those viewing meat eating as a social problem, it
may be helpful to understand the dynamics between these groups,
such as how unified they are, as consistency is critical in
influencing the majority [4].
One initial challenge for investigators pursuing these percep-
tions is in how to define and distinguish between the numerous
types of non-meat eaters. Even in something as straightforward as
defining vegetarianism, there is inconsistency in the literature and
in how people self-identify [5]. Although the focus is often on
specific dietary practices, individuals also differ in their motives for
abstaining from meat [5] [6], with the two most common motives
involving ethics (primarily the treatment of animals but also the
environment) and personal health. In this study, diet and motives
were combined to create three target groups: health vegetarians (those
who abstain from eating meat and seafood for reasons of personal
health), ethical vegetarians (those who abstain from eating meat and
seafood for reasons of harm to animals and/or the environment),
and vegans (those who avoid all animal products including dairy
and eggs). It was believed that this was the simplest and most
meaningful way to reduce non-meat eaters into manageable and
recognizable categories. Rothgerber [6], for example, found this
distinction helpful in explaining how vegetarian pet owners
handled the psychological consequences of living with meat-eating
pets. Vegans as targets were not divided according to their motives
because past studied have lumped them together, likely because of
their smaller size or because the extreme nature of their diet is
highly salient. In the analysis though, vegans as participants were
divided into health and ethical types.
To date, there appear to be no published studies that examine
all these groups simultaneously and the perceptions that they have
of each other. Several studies have compared two of these groups
and revealed general patterns of ingroup bias and outgroup
ambivalence. For example, Povey and colleagues [7] found that
vegetarians described veganism as humane, healthy, and ethical
but primarily, restrictive. Vegans perceived vegetarians as humane
and healthy on the one hand, but the most salient belief was that
vegetarians were hypocritical. The study did not ask vegans to
distinguish between health and ethical vegetarians, potentially
obscuring important differences nor did it assess whether vegans
differed in their perceptions depending on their own motives. It
also did not distinguish between vegetarian subgroups in their
perceptions of vegans. In an online qualitative study, ethical
vegetarians were critical of health vegetarians whom they
perceived as selfish and insufficiently radical [8]. There was some
common ground though as both groups seemed to become more
environmentally-committed over time. It is unclear how many of
the 33 participants were vegan though, and whether vegans
differed systematically from vegetarians in their perceptions and in
how they were perceived.
Horizontal Hostility
To account for these piecemeal findings and offer a theoretical
rationale for explaining perceptions between multiple non-meat
eating groups, the present work adopted a framework by White,
Langer
and
colleagues

understanding relations and predicting attitudes between similar
minority groups: horizontal hostility. Two attributes are relevant to
understanding horizontal hostility: similarity, the degree to which
groups share relevant characteristics; and distinctiveness, meaning
a lack of similarity/having a separate ingroup identity from an
outgroup and also the degree to which groups differ from the
mainstream. Although the majority may expect members of
similar minority groups to be favorably disposed toward each
other [see 11], a host of studies have revealed that intergroup
similarity can either facilitate attraction or hostility [12]. Accord-
ing to horizontal hostility, the direction of similarity – whether the
similar outgroup is more mainstream/less distinct (i.e., closer to
the majority group) or more extreme/more distinct (i.e., further
from the majority group) than the ingroup – moderates the
relationship between intergroup similarity and attitudes.
Specifically, minority groups should display relatively unfavor-
able attitudes toward members of an outgroup that is similar to but
more mainstream than the ingroup because such an outgroup
poses a unique threat to the distinctiveness of the minority ingroup
identity. This follows from the ‘‘reactive distinctiveness hypothe-
sis’’ (see [13]) of social identity theory [14], that threats to
intergroup distinctiveness (i.e., too much similarity) would instigate
attempts to restore distinctiveness. Similar, less distinctive groups
are targets for horizontal hostility because outsiders may lump
them together with the minority ingroup and that would threaten
the minority group’s distinctiveness in two ways: The minority
ingroup boundaries would become unclear and permeable; and
the minority ingroup would become larger (and less distinctive)
and add members who are closer to the mainstream than the
typical group member [9].
White and colleagues [10] generated three hypotheses based on
horizontal hostility: (1) evaluations of a similar but less distinct
outgroup would be negative relative to evaluations of a similar but
more distinct outgroup; (2) evaluations of an outgroup similar to
but less distinct than the ingroup would be more negative than
evaluations of an outgroup dissimilar and even less distinct than
the ingroup; and (3) evaluations of a similar but less distinct
outgroup would be more negative when the mainstream majority
was highly salient. The rationale for this last hypothesis is that
when the mainstream majority group is a salient part of the
intergroup context, the dimension that positively distinguishes the
minority group from the majority becomes valued and meaningful.
Thus, in such contexts the motivation to achieve and maintain
ingroup distinctiveness promotes hostility toward a similar but less
distinct minority group and more positive evaluations of a similar
but more distinct minority group.
The
asymmetric
pattern
of
judgments
implied
in
these
predictions has been demonstrated in various types of groups that
can be ordered along a mainstream-extreme continuum, including
Jewish congregations, minority Greek political parties, and soccer
teams [9] [10]. Of considerable interest for the present research, in
one study 76 vegetarians and 37 vegans rated the ingroup and
outgroup in a context that either made the mainstream omnivore
group highly salient or not [10]. Vegetarians rated vegans more
favorably when omnivores were highly salient than when they
were not because such affiliation with an extreme group helps
differentiate the ingroup from the mainstream. Consistent with
hypothesis 3, vegans rated vegetarians more negatively in the high
mainstream salience condition than in the low mainstream
salience condition. Although this study supports a horizontal
hostility framework and its emphasis on protecting a threatened
social identity through achieving distinctiveness, for our purposes it
fails to distinguish between vegetarian subgroups as targets and
participants and between vegan subgroups as participants. This
leaves open several questions including whether vegans would
evaluate health and ethical vegetarians similarly, whether this
would depend on their own diet motives, and whether health and
ethical vegetarians would evaluate vegans similarly.
A Continuum of Non-meat-eating Subgroups
In attempting to order non-meat eating subgroups along a
continuum, it is clear that vegans are highly distinct and on the
opposite end from omnivores. By adhering to a more restrictive
diet, vegans challenge dietary conventions even more than
vegetarians. To illustrate their deviation from the majority, vegans
offered more reasons for their diet and believed that animals were
more similar in their emotionality to humans than did vegetarians
[6]. Relative to vegetarians, they have also been found to express
greater concern over the impact of their diet on animal welfare
and the environment [15], were less likely to feed their pets a
meat-based diet [6], and scored higher on Herzog and colleagues’
animal attitudes scale [16] in unpublished data by Ruby, Cheng, &
Heine. Suggestive of their radicalism, vegans indicated that their
diet is more of a lifestyle than a diet [8], and for some, these
convictions run so strong they refuse sexual intimacy with non-
vegans [17]. Although plausible given the information that follows,
it is unclear whether vegans motivated by ethical concerns would
display these tendencies more strongly than vegans motivated by
health concerns because prior research has tended to lump all
vegans into one category.
In ordering the two vegetarian subgroups along the main-
stream-minority continuum, several pieces of evidence converge to
suggest that ethical vegetarians are more extreme and distinct than
health vegetarians. Because this insight is the basis for subsequent
predictions, its rationale warrants further discussion. First, ethical
vegetarians and vegans are ideologically similar. That is, vegans
are motivated more by ethical rather than health concerns [6].
The ideology of ethical vegetarians is more extreme than that of
health vegetarians, framing their diet within a philosophical,
ideological, or spiritual context [8] and being more motivated by
humanistic values [18]. Ethical vegetarians perceived themselves
as more radical than health vegetarians [8]. Indeed, they displayed
stronger opposition to foxhunting and capital punishment and
greater support for nuclear disarmament initiatives than other
vegetarians [19], were more likely than health vegetarians to feed
their pet a vegetarian diet and expressed greater concerns over
feeding their pet an animal-based diet [6], and compared to health
vegetarians reported being more disgusted by meat, showed more
concern when they saw others eat meat, expressed stronger
emotional reactions to meat consumption, and believed that meat
causes undesirable changes in personality [20]. In addition,
Rothgerber has found in unpublished data that the responses of
ethical vegetarians fall between those of health vegetarians and
vegans on several measures: number of reasons offered for their
vegetarianism and belief that humans and animals share emotional
experiences. Finally, ethical vegetarians were more likely to
abruptly adopt their diet and as might be expected given their
ideological compatibility, were more likely to transition to
veganism than health vegetarians [21].
In contrast, the focus within health vegetarians is internal,
addressing desires to sustain good health and avoid illness.
Emphasis is placed on personal health, fitness and energy rather
than outward toward other living creatures [8]. Rather than being
driven by ideology, many health vegetarians traced their diet to
personal experiences. Some researchers have suggested that the
ideology of health vegetarians is more conservative and normative
value driven, concerned with personal safety and security [18].
Health vegetarians tend to gradually eliminate meat from their

diet and are less likely to eliminate all animal products from their
diet [21]. As such, when considering factors beyond diet, they
appear to be closer to the mainstream and less distinct than ethical
vegetarians.
In the present study, health vegetarians, ethical vegetarians,
health vegans, and ethical vegans rated their own group and the
outgroups in a context that either made the mainstream group
(omnivores) salient or not. Based on horizontal hostility, the need
for a distinct ingroup identity, and on the logic that these minority
groups could be arranged along a continuum from omnivores-
health vegetarians-ethical vegetarians-vegans, the following hy-
potheses were made:
Hypothesis 1: Ethical vegetarians will give vegans more favorable
global evaluations than they will health vegetarians;
Hypothesis 2: Vegans will give health vegetarians more favorable
global evaluations than they will ethical vegetarians (with it unclear
whether vegan subgroups would differ from each other in this
assessment); and
Hypothesis 3: When the mainstream omnivore majority is a
salient part of the comparative context, the effects in the first and
second hypotheses will be stronger than when the mainstream
majority is not made salient.
Method
Ethics Statement
This research was approved by the Bellarmine University
Institutional Review Board and met all applicable standards for
the ethics of experimentation and research integrity. Written
informed consent was obtained from participants before they
completed the questionnaire. All participants were 18 years of age
or older.
Participants and Procedure
Participants were recruited primarily through the Vegetarian
Resource Group (www.vrg.org). According to their website, ‘‘The
Vegetarian Resource Group (VRG) is a non-profit organization
dedicated to educating the public on vegetarianism and the
interrelated issues of health, nutrition, ecology, ethics, and world
hunger.’’ A brief recruitment notice for a study on vegetarians and
vegans was posted on the organization’s blog, facebook and twitter
accounts, and in national and local newsletters along with a link to
the survey monkey website hosting the survey. Participants were
offered entry into a $50 lottery drawing in appreciation for their
participation. The survey was accessible from October 29, 2012 to
November 15, 2012.
During this period, 464 individuals completed all the survey
questions. After excluding respondents for reasons stated later, the
final dataset included 431 participants. Of the final sample, 83%
were females. 81% listed the U.S. as country of origin; 9% listed
Australia, 6% Canada, 4% Europe and less than 1% another
country. The mean age of participants was 39.0 (SD = 12.21). The
sample was well-educated: 4% reported having less than a high
school education, 9% had high school or GED, 9% had an
associate’s degree, 41% reported having a college degree, and 37%
reported having a graduate degree.
The salience of the majority group was manipulated by creating
alternative survey versions. In the high mainstream salience
condition, respondents were first asked to evaluate omnivores
before judging the three non-meat eating minority groups,
whereas in the low mainstream salience condition, respondents
rated the three minority groups without reference to omnivores.
Each participant completed the following measures as part of a
larger study.
Measures
Diet.
Participants’ diet was assessed with a single-item
question asking them to choose which diet applied to them:
vegetarian, vegan, or none of the above. Participants who selected
the last response (n = 31) were excluded from the analysis.
Dietary motives.
To assess their motives for following their
current diet, participants chose between one of the following
options: ‘‘I avoid eating meat primarily for ethical reasons; I avoid
eating meat primarily for health reasons; Ethical and health
reasons are about equal in importance to me; or none of the
above.’’ Participants giving the last response (n = 2) were excluded.
Participants choosing health motives or a combination of health
and ethical motives were combined into a single category of health
vegetarians. There were two reasons for this decision. First, prior
research has show that health and mixed-motive vegetarians are
similar in their perceptions [6] [22]. Second, there were no
differences between these two groups in their evaluations in the
present
study
(e.g.,
target
effect:
F(2,414) = 1.94,
p = .144,
gr2 = .01). In total, combining diet and motives, 16% of
respondents were considered health vegetarians (n = 69), 21%
ethical vegetarians (n = 90), 26% health vegans (n = 113), and 37%
ethical vegans (n = 159).
Global evaluations.
To assess global evaluations, partici-
pants were asked to give their opinions about the following groups
based on what they eat and why: Personally-Committed Vegetar-
ians (do not eat meat because of health reasons); Morally-
Committed Vegetarians (do not eat meat because of animal
cruelty/harm to environment); and Vegans (do not consume meat,
fish, or dairy products). In the high mainstream salience condition,
respondents were first asked to evaluate omnivores before
evaluating the non-meat eating groups. For each group, partic-
ipants were asked to judge their ‘‘overall attitude toward this
group’’ and provide their ‘‘overall favorability rating’’ of each
group. Answers were scored on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = extremely
negative/unfavorable; 7 = extremely positive/favorable). Correlations be-
tween these two measures were high for each of the three target
groups
(health
vegetarians,
r(430) = .96;
ethical
vegetarians,
r(430) = .96; vegans, r(430) = .97), so they were combined to form
a single measure.
Results
Data for the present study will be available from the Dryad
Digital Repository: http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.[sn878].
Global Evaluation – preliminary Analysis
A repeated-measures ANOVA with participants’ group identity
(health vegetarian, ethical vegetarian, health vegan, ethical vegan)
and mainstream salience (low, high) as between-subjects factors,
and the target (health vegetarian, ethical vegetarian, vegan) as a
within-subjects factor, revealed overall main effects for target
(F(2,423) = 71.16, p = .001, gr2 = .14) and mainstream salience
(F(1,423) = 33.03, p = .000, gr2 = .07). Here, health vegetarians
were rated the lowest and groups under high mainstream salience
were rated lower. Within participants, there was a significant
participants’ group 6target interaction (F(6,416) = 21.10, p = .000,

interaction
(F(6,416) = 2.68,
p = .014,
gr2 = .02). The two-way interaction is most simply explained by
a pattern of ingroup bias whereas the three-way interaction can be
accounted for by the results of Hypotheses 3. With low
mainstream salience, overall target effects disappeared for health
and ethical vegetarian respondents. Means appear in Table 1.

Global Evaluation - horizontal Hostility
Consistent with the first hypothesis, ethical vegetarians evalu-
ated health vegetarians less favorably than vegans, F(1,89) = 15.53,
p = .000, gr2 = .15. However, contrary to Hypothesis 2, vegans
did not rate ethical vegetarians less favorably than health
vegetarians. In fact, they rated ethical vegetarians more favorably
than health vegetarians, F(1,271) = 16.25, p = .000, gr2 = .06. This
main effect was qualified by a target x vegan type interaction,
F(1,271) = 11.91, p = .001, gr2 = .04. Ethical vegans rated ethical
vegetarians more favorably than they did health vegetarians,
F(1,158) = 28.24, p = .000, gr2 = .15, but health vegans did not
discriminate in their ratings of vegetarians, F(1,112) = 0.20,
p = .659, gr2 = .00. Consistent with the first part of Hypothesis
3, the interaction between target and mainstream salience was
significant
for
ethical
vegetarians,
F(1,88) = 6.81,
p = .011,
gr2 = .07. As expected, ethical vegetarians evaluated health
vegetarians less favorably than vegans when the mainstream
group (omnivores) was highly salient, F(1,51) = 19.48, p = .000,
gr2 = .28. They did not, however, distinguish between the two
groups when the mainstream group was not highly salient,
F(1,37) = 0.57, p = .453, gr2 = .02. The second part of Hypothesis
3 was not supported. Although the target x mainstream salience
interaction for vegan participants was significant, F(1,271) = 5.53,
p = .019, gr2 = .02, counter to predictions, when the mainstream
group was highly salient, vegans only marginally significantly
distinguished
between
health
and
ethical
vegetarians,
F(1,146) = 2.83, p = .095, gr2 = .02, albeit in the wrong direction.
Under conditions of low mainstream salience however, they rated
health vegetarians significantly less favorably than ethical vege-
tarians, F(1,124) = 27.75, p = .000, gr2 = .02.
Discussion
Because non-meat eating minority groups do not seemingly
compete with one another over scarce material resources – the
majority of Western vegetarians hail from the middle class [23] –
rather than opting for a model based on realistic conflict theory,
the present research focused on identity threats as the most salient
feature underlying this unique case of intergroup perceptions. The
hypotheses generated from a horizontal hostility framework were
partially successful in predicting evaluations between members of
non-meat eating minority groups. This lends some support to the
notion that these groups can be ordered in their proximity to
omnivores as health vegetarians, ethical vegetarians, and vegans.
Although objectively it may be difficult judge which vegetarian
subgroup is more mainstream and less distinct based simply on
their diet, the present results imply that psychologically at least,
ethical vegetarians perceive themselves as being more extreme
than do health vegetarians. Consistent with predictions, ethical
vegetarians evaluated health vegetarians less favorably than
vegans. On a superficial reading, it may appear strange that
ethical vegetarians would elevate a group that follows a less similar
diet to their own over one that follows a more similar diet.
However, it appears that for ethical vegetarians, vegetarianism is
about more than the behavior of avoiding meat, but that one’s
motives are of central importance. From prior research, it is clear
that the motives of ethical and health vegetarians stand in stark
contrast. Ethical vegetarians have stronger animal rights concerns,
react with greater disgust to eating meat, transition more rapidly to
a vegetarian diet, and most importantly, conceptualize their diet as
part of a larger philosophical framework [5] [8] [18] [20]. Their
focus is outward on preventing harm to animals and to the
environment. Ethical vegetarians may wonder how truly commit-
ted to these causes health vegetarians are. Fox and Ward [8] have
for example, shown examples in which ethical vegetarians
reported perceiving health vegetarians to be selfish, boring,
insufficiently radical, and inferior.
For health vegetarians, vegetarianism seems more of a personal
choice left up to the individual. The creed seems to hold that there
is nothing wrong per se with others eating meat – they may have
unique dietary issues to consider or they may be attaining good
health through other means such as exercise. Presumably, the
most a health vegetarian would hope for is that each omnivore
makes an informed decision about their diet and its health
implications. When Lindeman and Sirelius [18] described health
vegetarianism as having a conservative outlook, they were
referring to a decidedly apolitical stance seemingly taken by
health vegetarians. Because they lack the belief that meat eating is
morally wrong, there is less need to convert omnivores and less
need to perceive their dietary status as a social movement.
Health vegetarians, then, threaten to take attention away from
and undercut the distinctive message of ethical vegetarians. They

may induce omnivores to conclude that vegetarianism, rather than
being a political movement, is an individual lifestyle choice,
removing the moral implications of their behavior. For example,
omnivores may glean from health vegetarians that healthier,
organic meat free of pesticides is acceptable. If concerns with being
perceived properly by the mainstream are important to ethical
vegetarians, it becomes apparent why evaluations of health
vegetarians relative to vegans only became more negative when
ethical vegetarians were induced to think about the mainstream
omnivore group. For in these cases, social identity concerns about
being perceived as a distinct group would have become more
pressing for ethical vegetarians. Future research building upon this
work and other studies of intergroup perceptions between health
and ethical vegetarians [8], then, needs to account for the
moderating role of mainstream salience.
In contrast and counter to predictions, instead of increasing
pressure to achieve distinctiveness by derogating a more similar
outgroup (i.e., ethical vegetarians), high mainstream salience did
not lead vegans to differentiate between vegetarian subgroups.
When vegan participants were made to think about omnivores,
they appear to have self-categorized on the basis of diet, producing
two effects: Differences in distinctiveness between vegetarian
subgroups became minimized as attention was placed upon their
similar diet; and ingroup-outgroup differences became more
striking leading ratings of both health and ethical vegetarians to
decrease relative to conditions when the mainstream was not
salient, paralleling the findings of White and colleagues [10] of
increased ingroup bias under mainstream salience. This supports
the reflective distinctiveness hypothesis [13] that intergroup
differentiation is more likely to occur when groups are clearly
distinct. In many practical examples in which omnivores are
present, then, vegans likely attend to dietary differences, expand-
ing intergroup differences while reducing intragroup variability.
When eating with omnivores, for example, vegans would be more
likely to disparage vegetarians for consuming eggs (which leads to
male roosters being killed [24]) and dairy (which indirectly
supports the veal industry [24]) because their focus is on their own
vegan diet and preserving its positivity and distinctiveness. Thus,
research showing that vegans perceive vegetarians as hypocritical
[7] may be most applicable when the mainstream is highly salient.
The present results suggest that vegan perceptions of vegetarians
depend not only upon mainstream salience, but also on which
vegetarian subgroup is being evaluated. Future studies should be
careful in generalizing vegan perceptions of vegetarians across all
vegetarian subgroups. Contrary to the distinctiveness threats
outlined by horizontal hostility, vegans distinguished between
vegetarians by rating ethical vegetarians more favorably then health
vegetarians. That is, unlike the far-from-the-mainstream groups
studied by White and colleagues [10], vegans did not evaluate the
nearest group (ethical vegetarians) less favorably than the group
closest to the mainstream (health vegetarians). This overall effect
was qualified by two factors: (1) the aforementioned effect of
mainstream salience and (2) vegan type, i.e., health vegans did not
differentiate in their evaluations of vegetarians. This latter result
suggests that future research should be cautious in lumping all
vegans together.
To account for the unexpected main effect showing that vegans
give
higher
ratings
to
ethical
vegetarians
than
to
health
vegetarians, it is useful to consider how the non-meat eating
minority groups studied here may differ from the groups
previously considered. In published research on horizontal
hostility, there is typically one major dimension distinguishing
between minority groups. Greek political parties differ primarily
on their political ideology, and Jewish denominations differ in their
religiousness. In the case of those abstaining from meat, there are
two conceptually distinct factors distinguishing between groups,
their dietary practices and their motivation for following such
practices. When the mainstream omnivore group was made highly
salient, it appears vegans attended to dietary differences between
themselves and others. But when the mainstream group was not
salient, it appears motives for one’s diet became perceptually
important, and the motives of ethical vegetarians were perceived
more favorably than those of health vegetarians. This seems
largely driven by the fact that ethical vegans appear to have more
strongly identified with ethical vegetarians and perceived them
more favorably than they did health vegetarians, who pose a
greater threat to their own vegan ideology. As noted, vegans
motivated by health concerns did not demonstrate this form of
ingroup bias based on diet motive, failing to distinguish between
ethical and health vegetarians.
These conclusions are limited by the nature of the sample.
Participants were recruited primarily through a vegetarian website
that predominately attracted vegans and those with ethical
motivations for their meat abstention. Relative to others, those
reading the website may very well be more committed to the
vegetarian cause, derive more of their social identity from it,
organize their free time around abstaining from meat, and be
more socially connected to other vegetarians. They may have
thought more about their own and others’ motives for abstaining
from meat and formed stronger opinions about distinctions
between non-meat eaters. The study did not focus on individual
differences, but it is possible that identity pressures and the need to
perceive one’s own group in positive and distinct terms may have
been stronger among these participants. For vegetarians and
vegans who derive less of their identity from their meat eating
status, the differentiation between groups observed in the present
study may be more muted. Of course, it is also possible that those
presumably more identified with the cause may discriminate less
between subgroups in an effort to strengthen unity. Future
research with other samples may help resolve which possibility is
more likely.
In conclusion, the present research adds to a growing body of
literature [8] [10] that despite their shared status as non-meat
eating minorities, vegetarians and vegans do make evaluative
distinctions between each other. Overall, ethical vegetarians
evaluated themselves less similarly to health vegetarians than they
did vegans, a group they may assume holds a similar worldview,
while ethical vegans in turn rated ethical vegetarians closer to the
ingroup than they rated health vegetarians. Health vegetarians
were similar to the other groups in exhibiting ingroup bias, but
they showed little differentiation between ethical vegetarians and
vegans. While a bit of an oversimplification, it appears, then, that
what is most important among non-meat eating minorities – at
least in terms of perceptions of others – is one’s worldview and
philosophical framework. The specific diet chosen to embody
one’s beliefs seems less critical in these intergroup perceptions. It is
understandable that outsiders would focus on the observable
behavior of what individuals consume and incorrectly assume that
diet is the most important dimension of their non-omnivore status;
after all, they likely do not have access to the interior motives of
others. However, to those abstaining from meat, the internal
motives may constitute a much larger basis of self-definition and in
defining others.
