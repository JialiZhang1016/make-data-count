1 | INTRODUCTION
The fundamental biological process of sex determination has been 
under intense scientific research for decades, mainly because of its 
profound implications on the phenotype of individuals and the for-
mation of sex ratios in natural populations (West, Reece, & Sheldon, 
2002). It is therefore a process of major evolutionary significance. 
The mechanisms of sex determination have, for a long time, been 
classified discretely as either genetic (GSD) or environmental (ESD). 
However, researchers are now in agreement that genotypic and en-
vironmental sex determination does not necessarily constitute a di-
chotomy, but rather two extremes of a continuum (Sarre, Georges, & 
Quinn, 2004).
Sex allocation studies on birds and mammals are numerous 
(reviewed in Wapstra et al., 2007) and show that the majority of 
these species have genetic sex determination. Reptiles (squamates

Abstract
Sex determination in Australian agamid lizards shows a complex framework of differ-
ent mechanisms, varying even among closely related taxa. It is clear that discrete 
classification of these species as either having genetic (GSD) or environmental sex 
determination (ESD) does not agree with empirical data. Although many species in 
this group show temperature-­dependent sex determination (TSD), recent evidence 
suggests additional genetic or epigenetic effects. A proposed model explaining the 
adaptive significance and evolution of TSD in short-­lived agamids predicts that selec-
tion will favor temperature-­biased sex ratios in species with intense male-­male com-
petition. Here, we use experimental incubation at (near) constant temperatures to 
test whether the sex of Australian painted dragons (Ctenophorus pictus) is influenced 
by temperature, building on previous research yet to have reached an agreement 
regarding the role of temperature in this species. In this study, incubation tempera-
ture and parental identity affected hatchling sex suggesting that environment and 
genetics may work in concert to determine sex in this species. Although our results 
are consistent with TSD, our data cannot rule out a temperature-­by-­sex effect on egg 
or hatchling mortality. However, our findings together with the observed differences 
of sex determination systems in closely related species within this genus may provide 
novel opportunities to address fundamental questions in the evolution of sex deter-
mination systems.

specifically), however, show a much more diverse array of sex deter-
mination processes (Sarre et al., 2004; Shine, Elphick, & Donnellan, 
2002; Wapstra et al., 2007), making them of particular interest in 
studies of sex allocation. The most studied environmental effect 
on sex determination in reptiles is temperature (temperature-­
dependent sex determination [TSD]), where offspring sex is deter-
mined by the thermal regimes experienced by the embryo in the 
egg. TSD has been shown in all major reptile groups (Janzen & Krenz, 
2004), including some squamates, most turtles, the tuatara, and all 
crocodilians. The widespread occurrence of TSD in reptile taxa pos-
sessing substantially different life-­histories makes the search of a 
single “fits all” model, explaining the adaptive significance of ESD in 
all reptiles, futile (Bull & Charnov, 1989).
Numerous models have been proposed to explain the evolution 
and adaptive significance of TSD (see reviews by Bull, 1983; Shine, 
1999; Uller, Pen, Wapstra, Beukeboom, & Komdeur, 2007). However, 
only one model has received relatively widespread acceptance, the 
Charnov-­Bull model (Charnov & Bull, 1977). This model predicts that 
TSD will be favored over GSD when some environmental condition 
affects the fitness of sons and daughters differently and that nei-
ther the offspring nor the mother possesses any major predictive 
power over these effects. This model assumes direct fitness bene-
fits of varying environmental regimes in the offspring and that these 
effects vary with sex. The model does not, however, distinguish be-
tween a direct effect on offspring fitness and an effect correlated 
with the actual causal factor (Warner, Uller, & Shine, 2009), nor does 
it recognize indirect fitness effects. These limitations may make it 
difficult to apply the model to predict the sex determination sys-
tem of species based on their life-­history, especially in cases where 
temperature indirectly affects the fitness of males and females 
differently.
The adaptive significance of TSD in short-­lived lizards has been 
suggested by Warner et al. (2009) to follow a framework based on 
fitness effects of the timing of hatching. In contrast to the Charnov-­
Bull model, this model does not attempt to explain the evolution of 
ESD in all reptiles, but focuses on a single family (Agamidae) con-
taining many short-­lived lizards. This model shows that in species 
with intense male-­male competition for mating opportunities, newly 
hatched sons are likely to achieve little reproductive success in 
their first year when faced with competition from males of previ-
ous cohorts. The reproductive success of daughters will, however, 
most likely be enhanced if they hatch early enough in the season to 
reach sexual maturity within their first year of life (Harlow & Taylor, 
2000). In this case, the fitness benefits of TSD are not direct, but a 
product of sex-­dependent probabilities of juveniles breeding in their 
first year. The model suggested by Warner et al. (2009) predicts that 
selection for TSD will be strongest in short-­lived reptiles with (a) a 
prolonged breeding season; (b) a short lifespan and early matura-
tion; (c) intense male-­male competition; and (c) timing of hatching 
having little effect on juvenile survival. The Australian dragon lizards 
(Agamidae) are of particular interest when testing the validity of this 
model, as these lizards have distinct variation in life-­histories, so-
cial systems, and sex determination processes (Harlow, 2004). They 
have shown a complex diversity of species with GSD and TSD, with 
even closely related species differing in sex determining mechanisms 
(Harlow, 2004; Harlow & Taylor, 2000; Uller, Odierna, & Olsson, 
2008). Furthermore, experimental evidence for TSD in one agamid 
lizard, the Australian painted dragon (Ctenophorus pictus), may not 
be consistent at reassessment of these effects (Harlow, 2004; Uller, 
Mott, Odierna, & Olsson, 2006). This suggests that the sex deter-
mination mechanism may differ among populations or that the in-
consistencies may be due to weakness in experimental design. In 
the same species, female identity has consistently been shown to 
influence sex ratios (Uller et al., 2006), which seems to concur with 
the notion that something more than temperature or genes alone 
influences sex determination.
Here, we use Australian painted dragons to further examine the 
effect of incubation temperature on the sex of hatchlings, building 
on the work of Harlow (2004) and Uller et al. (2006), while testing 
the validity of the model proposed by Warner et al. (2009). Although 
we do not test the adaptive significance of TSD, models may be very 
important when attempting to predict the sex determination system 
of a species. The contradictory results on TSD in this species shown 
in Harlow (2004) and Uller et al. (2006) suggest a more dynamic 
sex determination system than previously discussed, confirmed by 
a consistent influence of female identity on sex ratios (Uller et al., 
2006). Furthermore, the life-­history of C. pictus is in congruence 
with the traits listed by Warner et al.’s model, thus, predicting that 
this species has a temperature-­influenced sex determination system.
2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 | Study species and husbandry
The Australian painted dragon is a small (8–16 g, 65–95 mm snout-­
vent length [SVL]) agamid lizard occurring in open sandy habitats 
and low vegetation, with a habitat range from central and western 
New South Wales to Western Australia. They are short-­lived (only 
about 10% living to a second hibernation), and males are highly ter-
ritorial and compete for mating opportunities (Olsson, Schwartz, 
Uller, & Healey, 2007). It is a sexually dimorphic species, with males 
being larger and polymorphic with respect to head color, typically 
occurring in three different morphs (red, orange, and yellow). Adult 
painted dragons used in this study were caught by noose or hand 
at Yathong Nature Reserve, New South Wales, Australia (145°35′E; 
32°35′S) in October, 2014 and transported in cloth bags to hold-
ing facilities at the University of Sydney where they were housed 
until export to Sweden (2016) on export and import permits from 
Australian and Swedish authorities. The lizards were transported by 
airplane during hibernation. Lizards were housed in mating pairs in 
cages (50 L × 40 W × 35 H cm) with a sand substrate and a 40-­W 
spotlight at one end and rocks to allow thermoregulation and shel-
ter use. Additional sand was added to the corner of each cage and 
periodically moistened to attract oviposition. The continuous pres-
ence of males is required for successful fertilization of eggs (Uller &

HANSSON and OLSSON
Olsson, 2005), and males were therefore kept with females through-
out the entire experiment. Males and females were assigned to mat-
ing pairs which were sustained throughout the entire experiment. All 
cages were sprayed daily with a mist of water and lizards were fed a 
variation of crickets and meal worms dusted daily with calcium and 
weekly with multivitamins. As thermal profiles of nests in situ have 
not been examined in this species, we used local ambient tempera-
ture data from the catch site in order to analyze the results in the 
context of seasonal temperature variations. Local climate data were 
acquired from an Australian Bureau of Meteorology station less than 
50 km from the catch site. The research was conducted under scien-
tific research permits issued by the Animal Ethics Committees at the 
University of Gothenburg, Sweden (protocol number: 001066) and 
at the University of Sydney, Australia (protocol number: 2013/6050).
2.2 | Egg collection, incubation, and 
sexing of hatchlings
Cages were checked daily for recently laid clutches. Females laid 
1–4 clutches with an average of 1.63 ± 0.20 (mean ± SE, N = 19) 
clutches with an average 3.67 ± 0.27 (mean ± SE, N = 30) eggs per 
clutch. There were 19 first clutches (i.e. first clutch laid by a female), 
8-­second clutches, three-­third clutches (Supporting information 
Table S1). Any eggs that were overtly unhealthy were discarded; 
the remaining were incubated (N = 110 from 19 females). The true 
proportion of fertilized eggs was, however, unknown. Prior to incu-
bation, the eggs were cleaned from sand and moisture, weighed to 
the nearest 0.001 g, and placed individually in 125-­ml disposable 
plastic cups half-­buried in moist vermiculite (1:5 by volume, resulting 
approximately a −12 kPa water potential) filling a third of the cup. 
The cups were sealed using plastic cling wrap and a rubber band 
to prevent extensive moisture loss and placed in incubators set at 
constant 28, 30, and 32°C. Treatment temperatures were chosen 
based on the previously suggested ideal incubation temperature of 
30°C (Olsson et al., 2007). The actual temperature in each incuba-
tor was measured using HOBO H08 data loggers (Onset Computer 
Corporation, Bourne, MA, USA) throughout the entire experiment 
(191 days). The actual temperatures in the incubators were in the 28, 
30, and 32°C treatment (mean °C ± SE): 27.9 ± 0.002 (N = 13,337), 
29.9 ± 0.004 (N = 10,055), and 31.8 ± 0.004 (N = 15,453), respec-
tively. Eggs from a single clutch were allocated equally across the 
three temperature treatments, in concordance with a split-­clutch 
design. To minimize the effect of possible thermal gradients inside 
the incubators, the cups were rotated among three shelves in each 
incubator every 2 weeks. Water was added to each cup during this 
rotation accounting for the small, but clear, loss of water through 
evaporation (about 1 g per week). Incubators were checked daily 
for hatchlings and dead eggs. The sex of hatchlings was determined 
by hemipenal transillumination in males (Brown, 2009) after a few 
weeks, as hemepenes were easier to identify at this stage (Figure 1). 
Hatchlings that died prior to sexing were frozen for later sexing. 
Some deceased offspring, however, could unfortunately not be 
sexed due to the compromised tissue quality and lack of vasculariza-
tion on which transillumination sexing depends.
2.3 | Statistical analysis
The effect of incubation temperature on sex was analyzed using sex 
(binary data) as the dependent variable, mean incubation tempera-
ture as fixed factor, and parental identity as random effect. Maternal 
and paternal identity could unfortunately not be separated as fe-
males were housed with the same male throughout the experiment. 
The model was fitted following a generalized linear mixed model 
(GLMM) approach using the PROC GLIMMIX macro in SAS v.9.4 
with a binomial distribution and a logit link function (Littell, Milliken, 
Stroup, & Wolfinger, 1996). Effect of temperature was tested using a 
F test and the random effect using a likelihood ratio test.
3 | RESULTS
The sex ratios in the three temperature treatments were consist-
ently female-­biased (proportion of males to total number of hatch-
lings ± SE): 0.15 ± 0.08 (28°C, N = 20), 0.36 ± 0.13 (30°C, N = 14) 
and 0.46 ± 0.13 (32°C, N = 13), see Figure 2. Both incubation tem-
perature and parental identity affected offspring sex (Table 1), with 
a higher proportion of females produced at lower temperatures. The 
mean monthly air temperature increased steadily throughout the 
natural breeding season (September to December), with an average 
increase of 4.7°C per month (Figure 3). The egg mortality was 41% 
(Supporting information Table S2).
4 | DISCUSSION
The research of reptiles has consistently shown that sex alloca-
tion cannot be explained with discrete sex determination systems 
(GSD or ESD) but requires a continuum between the two (Sarre

et al., 2004), with a varying degree of influence from genetic and 
environmental factors depending on species. Here, we provide 
evidence for TSD in C. pictus, as predicted by the model proposed 
by Warner et al. (2009). We also show that parental identity af-
fects offspring sex ratio, consistent with the findings of Uller et al. 
(2006). These results clearly show the complexity of the sex de-
termination system in this species, and below, we discuss these 
results in turn.
4.1 | Temperature effects
Experimental work exploring the effect of temperature on sex allo-
cation in C. pictus has, inconsistently, shown both the presence (pre-
sent study; Harlow, 2004) and absence of TSD (Uller et al., 2006). 
The former having somewhat small sample sizes, something not 
uncommon in incubation experiments, with an unpredictable num-
ber of fertilized clutches laid and hatching success. Albeit a larger 
sample size, Uller et al. (2006) did not follow a split-­clutch design, 
potentially obscuring possible temperature effects. This may be par-
ticularly true as the identity of parents has been shown to affect 
the sex ratio of offspring in this species (present study; Uller et al., 
2006). The sex ratios from the different temperature treatments 
in Uller et al.’s study are all close to 40% males. In our study, how-
ever, the sex ratio increases with temperature, from very few males 
in the lowest temperature treatment to approaching 50% males in 
the highest temperature treatment. Furthermore, the model pro-
posed by Warner et al. (2009) predicts that selection should favor a 
thermal effect on sex determination in C. pictus. The model expects 
that selection for TSD will be strongest in reptiles with: (a) a pro-
longed breeding season; (b) a short lifespan; (c) intense male-­male 
competition; and (d) little effect of hatching date (time of year) on 
the survival of juveniles. The three-­first factors are easily tested, 
and C. pictus possess all three. The fourth factor is more difficult to 
examine, and field data on short-­lived reptiles are limited. Hatching 
date was, however, found not to affect juvenile survival differently 
among the sexes in the Australian jacky dragon, Amphibolurus mu-
ricatus (Warner & Shine, 2005). In accordance with Warner et al.’s 
model, females produced at lower incubation temperature assume 
an increased probability of early reproductive success. Furthermore, 
the high male-­male competition over mating opportunities will most 
likely severely limit the early reproductive success of younger males 
when in contest with larger territorial males from previous cohorts 
(Aragón, López, & Martín, 2006; Jenssen, Decourcy, & Congdon, 
2005; Olsson, 1992).
If such variation of reproductive success occurs in C. pictus, sea-
sonal timing of hatching could be the outcome of: (a) active female 
nest-­site choice, resulting in eggs being laid in different nest-­sites 
early versus late in the season; or (b) passive nest-­site choice, re-
sulting in eggs being exposed to seasonal differences in nest tem-
peratures. In the first scenario, maternal nest-­site choice could shift 
seasonally, selecting nests with a temperature that would produce 
the sex most favored to that time of the season. Although the pres-
ence of nest-­site choice in C. pictus has not yet been investigated, a 
close relative (Hugall, Foster, Hutchinson, & Lee, 2008), the jacky 
dragon, chooses nest-­sites adaptively (Warner & Shine, 2008). In the 
second scenario, however, adaptive maternal nest-­site selection is 
not required but is simply consistent with seasonal changes in am-
bient (and thereby nest) temperatures. Seasonal thermal variations 
then act to produce the optimal sex linked to a particular season. 
In the case of this study, climate data showed that C. pictus experi-
ences a seasonal increase in ambient temperatures during the breed-
ing season, and in agreement with the model, the results showed

that lower temperature (analogues to earlier in the season) produced 
a higher proportion of females. Although other studies on TSD in 
Ctenophorus spp. are relatively few, the genus seems to follow the 
“short-­lived agamid” model discussed above. Of the four species 
tested (Ctenophorus decresii, Ctenophorus fordi, Ctenophorus ornatus 
and C. pictus), all are short-­lived, have a prolonged breeding season, 
and male-­male competition over mating opportunities has been ob-
served in all but C. fordi. In agreement with predictions, evidence for 
TSD has been found in all species but C. fordi (Harlow, 2000, 2004; 
Uller et al., 2008). In-­depth comparisons among the TSD species 
from past studies and the present study are difficult because previ-
ous work performed either has very small sample sizes in the higher 
thermal ranges or lack such treatments altogether. However, sample 
sizes are larger in the low temperature treatments and these show a 
similar result to the present study, with strongly female-­biased sex 
ratios.
A major limitation of this study is that we cannot rule out 
temperature-­by-­sex effects on mortality as an explanation for the 
observed differences in sex ratio among the tested incubation tem-
peratures. This effect could be present during the egg stage leading 
to a greater mortality of one sex during embryogenesis and thus cre-
ating a false impression of TSD. An alternative explanation for the 
high proportion of unhatched eggs in this study is that they were 
never fertilized in the first place. In another study of the same spe-
cies, they report on a hatching success consistently over 81% (Tobler, 
Healey, & Olsson, 2011), even when eggs were injected with testos-
terone. Thus, it is very unlikely that the current analysis is based on 
fully fertile males. As stated, females are only able to produce fertile 
eggs in the presence of males (Uller & Olsson, 2005) which of course 
assumes that the males mating with them are fully fertile. We be-
lieve that the artificial hibernation may produce variations in male 
fertility, some males may not yet have reached full fertility since 
“spring” emergence, as shown in other hibernating reptiles (Olsson 
& Madsen, 1996).
We found a significant temperature-­by-­sex effect on posthatch-
ing mortality (Supporting information Table S3) which is important 
as we were unable to sex about half of the hatchlings that died prior 
to sexing. If a similar effect was true in these unsexed hatchlings, this 
difference could explain the observed differences in sex ratio among 
the incubation temperatures. This limitation in the experimental de-
sign could easily have been avoided by sexing the hatchlings earlier 
and thus eliminating the posthatching mortality and tissue-­quality 
problem.
4.2 | Parental effects
Parental effects on sex ratio has been found in C. pictus (present 
study; Uller et al., 2006), suggesting a sex determination system more 
complex than either one end of the GSD-­ESD continuum. A recent 
study by Warner, Uller, and Shine (2013) found novel evidence for 
a transgenerational effect on sex determination in the jacky dragon. 
They show that the incubation temperature experienced by the fa-
ther affected the sex of the offspring, an effect sustained for several 
years. This recent discovery gives an additional level to an ever in-
creasing complexity of sex determination in Australian agamid lizards. 
The jacky dragon and painted dragon share many life-­history traits, 
both are short-­lived, have a prolonged breeding season, are territorial, 
and have a temperature aspect to their sex determination (in agree-
ment with the “short-­lived agamid” model discussed above). This 
transgenerational sex determination found in a closely related spe-
cies to C. pictus offers interesting opportunities for further research. 
It is, however, more likely that the parental effect on sex ratio in this 
study is maternally derived, as previously shown by Uller et al. (2006), 
with a consistent effect of female identity on sex ratio. Although this 
study does not examine the source of this parental influence, our re-
sults clearly show that the painted dragon possesses a more complex 
sex determination system than previously thought. Furthermore, her-
itable variations for sex ratios in species with TSD have consistently 
been shown in reptiles (Bull, Vogt, & Bulmer, 1982; Janzen, 1992; 
Rhen & Lang, 1998; Rhen, Schroeder, Sakata, Huang, & Crews, 2011). 
It is likely that the parental effect on sex ratio found in this study is 
due to maternally heritable differences in sex determining reaction 
norms, effectively creating a variation between females or embryos 
in how the developmental system respond to temperature.
To date, research on C. pictus demonstrates an increasingly 
complex sex determination system, including effects of incubation 
temperature and possibly genetic and epigenetic factors (Harlow, 
2004; Uller et al., 2006; Warner et al., 2013). Although cytogenet-
ically distinct sex chromosomes have not been found in this species 
(Uller et al., 2006), more advanced high-­resolution molecular tech-
niques, such as comparative genomic hybridization, may detect sub-
tle differences in chromosomes between the sexes, as shown in the 
freshwater turtle Chelodina longicollis (Ezaz et al., 2006). The current 
repertoire of research on short-­lived agamid lizards seems to follow 
the “short-­lived agamid” model as an explanation for the adaptive 
significance and evolution of TSD in this group. Furthermore, the 
variation in sex determination systems among closely related species 
(Uller et al., 2006, 2008) and the presence of both environmental 
and genetic aspects to sex determination in Australian agamid liz-
ards offer a novel opportunity to address fundamental questions on 
the evolution of sex determination systems.
