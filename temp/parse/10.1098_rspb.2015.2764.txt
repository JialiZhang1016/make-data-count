Nutrition is a key component of life-history theory, yet we know little about
how diet quality shapes life-history evolution across species. Here, we test
whether quantitative measures of nutrition are linked to life-history evolution
across 96 species of butterflies representing over 50 independent diet shifts.
We find that butterflies feeding on high nitrogen host plants as larvae are
more fecund, but their eggs are smaller relative to their body size. Nitrogen
and sodium content of host plants are also both positively related to eye
size. Some of these relationships show pronounced lineage-specific effects.
Testis size is not related to nutrition. Additionally, the evolutionary timing
of diet shifts is not important, suggesting that nutrition affects life histories
regardless of the length of time a species has been adapting to its diet. Our
results suggest that, at least for some lineages, species with higher nutrient
diets can invest in a range of fitness-related traits like fecundity and eye size
while allocating less to each egg as offspring have access to a richer diet.
These results have important implications for the evolution of life histories
in the face of anthropogenic changes in nutrient availability.
1. Significance statement
Why do organisms vary drastically in life-history traits? Some have many off-
spring, while others have relatively few; some have large brains and long lives,
while others do not. In this research, we show that variation across species in
such fitness-related traits may sometimes be due to differences in nutrition.
Species of butterflies that feed on more nutrient-dense plant families as cater-
pillars produce more eggs (that are relatively smaller) and have larger eyes. The
length of time a species has been adapting to their present diet does not matter,
suggesting that nutrition may be a fundamental constraint on life-history
evolution in some lineages. This is particularly relevant today because humans
have drastically increased the availability of many nutrients.
2. Introduction
Biologists have long sought to understand why fitness-related traits vary across
species [1,2]. It is well established that nutrition affects the expression of life-
history traits and trade-offs within species [3–5], and it has been hypothesized
to shape life-history evolution across species [6,7]. Indeed, variation in diet quality
across species has been suggested to influence the evolution of development and
body size in mammals and insects [8,9], brain size, fecundity and lifespan in
humans [10–12], and lifespan in butterflies [13]. However, no systematic studies
exist to test how quantitative variation in nutrition affects life-history traits across
species. On the one hand, extending the theory developed for life-history vari-
ation within species, we might surmise that species with access to higher
quality diets can afford to allocate more nutrients to a range of life-history
traits, masking underlying trade-offs between traits [3,14]. Thus, one might pre-
dict that species on more nutrient rich diets would be more fecund and have
larger traits tied to fitness, such as brains and testes. On the other hand, nutrition

may play a minor role in life-history evolution if organisms
can cope with low nutrient conditions through adaptive
nutritional plasticity, shifts in gut morphology, metabolic
adaptations or symbiotic associations [15–19]. Determining
the extent to which nutrient availability affects life-history evol-
ution is particularly important today given anthropogenic
change in nutrients once limited in availability such as nitrogen
and phosphorus [20]: changes in nutrition have major conse-
quences for the expression and evolution of life-history traits
and hence demographic and evolutionary processes [21].
Investigating the evolutionary importance of nutrition is
hampered by the difficulty in quantifying nutrient availability
across species over their evolutionary histories. A number of
studies have approached this question using various proxies
for nutrition [22] or comparing broad classes of foraging
modes [23,24]. Specialist herbivores such as phytophagous
insects are a useful system because nutrient content has been
shown to vary systematically across plant families [25,26]. But-
terflies in particular are a powerful system because most of an
individual’s essential nutrients (e.g. nitrogen, phosphorus)
come from larval feeding and larval host plants are known
for most species. Furthermore, by mapping these host records
onto lepidopteran phylogenies, we can estimate the relative
timing of diet shifts [27].
Here, we investigate how nutrition affects life-history evol-
ution across 96 species of butterflies that represent over 50
independent diet shifts across 38 plant families (figure 1).
We focus on nitrogen and phosphorus, both important com-
ponents of proteins and nucleic acids, and generally the
major limiting macronutrients in the growth and development
of terrestrial herbivores [9,28]. We secondarily focus on sodium
as a major limiting micronutrient for herbivores as sodium is
important in brain and muscle growth and function in both
invertebrates and vertebrates [29,30]. Such a stoichiometric
approach [31] allows direct quantitative comparison of specific
nutrients across plant families and integration with the ecosys-
tem literature on changing nutrient availability. Although
other elements are clearly important in organismal develop-
ment (e.g. carbon, oxygen, hydrogen), our focal elements
are particularly important for herbivores because they are
much less concentrated in plant relative to animal tissue
[30,32]. We take a broad view of life histories [33], focusing on
whole organism investment in maintenance, reproduction and
survival; we consider not only traits directly tied to fecundity
(egg number and size, testis size), but also body size, which is
correlated with fecundity in insects [34]. We additionally
measure eye size because vision is important for males to
secure a mate [35,36] and host finding in females [37,38].
We test the prediction that species on higher nutrient diets
will be larger, more fecund, invest more in individual offspring
and have larger eyes. Additionally, by looking at the effect
of timing of a diet shift, we test the alternate prediction that
adaptation to diet over time relaxes the extent to which diet
constrains life-history traits.
3. Material and methods
(a) Overview of butterfly specimens
We focused our sampling efforts on 96 species of butterflies that
were fairly specialized (feeding on one to three host plant families)
and represented as many independent host shifts as possible.
We used both fresh-caught specimens (which we could dissect
for fecundity measures) and museum specimens (for which only
external measures could be taken). Field-caught specimens (65
species, n . 2 individuals per species, n ¼ 644 individuals) were
obtained from 11 states from across the USA (see the electronic
supplementary material, file 1). Live individuals were transported
back to the laboratory where they were stored in sealed containers
at 2208C prior to abdomen dissections and wing measurements.
As detailed below, field-caught specimens were used for measures
of body size, egg number, egg size and testis size. We additionally
measured species obtained from the University of Minnesota Insect
Collection, Department of Entomology (n ¼ 68 species, 518 individ-
uals; see the electronic supplementary material, file 1). We focused
our measurements on museum specimens from 25 US states; 6% of
specimens originated in Canada, Central or South America. Only
species with at least three individuals available were targeted for
measurements. As detailed below, museum specimens were used
for measures of body size and eye size. Sex was determined based
on wing pattern and either gonad dissection (field specimens) or
genitalia inspection (museum specimens).
(b) Quantification of host plant nutrition
We obtained plant nutrient data from three sources. Data on nitro-
gen and phosphorus were obtained from Borer [39]. Plant sodium
content was obtained from Watanabe et al. [25]. We additionally
collected 117 samples of host plants commonly used by butterflies
that were poorly represented for the nutrients in which we were
interested, in addition to a subset of re-sampled species to ensure
our methods were in alignment with previous studies (samples
from eight states across the USA; see the electronic supplementary
material, file 1). We measured nitrogen using the Dumas method
[40] and used inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry to
measure phosphorus and sodium. Together, we drew from 8381
plant samples for our measurements of plant nutrient levels. We
focused on percentage nutrient content for dried leaf samples.
Angiosperm phylogeny group III (APG III) [41] was used to clas-
sify all plant genera into currently accepted families. As found in
other studies [25,42], there were significant differences in nutrient
availability
across
plant
families
(electronic
supplementary
material, figure S1). For the subset of plant families fed on by but-
terflies in this study, family-level variation was more pronounced
for nitrogen (n ¼ 4843; R2 ¼ 0.32, F238,4604 ¼ 14.6, p , 0.0001) and
sodium (n ¼ 2148; R2 ¼ 0.52, F141,2006 ¼ 15.2, p , 0.0001) than
for phosphorus (n ¼ 4947; R2 ¼ 0.32, F226,46720 ¼ 9.64, p , 0.0001).
Plant family-level nutrient values were calculated as the
average nutrient level for all samples from a given family.
Median sample sizes per family were 24, 25 and 8, for nitrogen,
phosphorus and sodium, respectively. Plant families were, on
average, represented by nutrient values from five genera. In
our analyses, we treat each nutrient separately because tight cor-
relations between nitrogen and phosphorus content [42] make it
statistically challenging to test for interactions between nutrients.
Host plant records for butterflies were obtained from Scott [43].
We recorded the number of host plant species per plant genus for
each butterfly species, ignoring records listed as ‘dubious’ or
‘oviposition only’. APG III was used to classify all plant genera
into currently accepted families. We calculated a host family-level
metric of butterfly nutrition with a weighted average for each nutri-
ent. For instance, if a species had five host records on Fabaceae and
five host records on Brassicaceae, the average nutrient value was
calculated as the sum of (1/2)  (family-level nitrogen of Fabaceae)
and (1/2)  (family-level nitrogen of Brassicaceae).
(c) Measurement of life-history traits
On all specimens, we measured wing length as the length from
the articulation of the forewing with the thorax to the wing apex.
For field-caught specimens, forewings were completely removed
from the butterfly and placed flat for imaging (mean ¼ 9.9

individuals per species; 644 total measurements). For museum
specimens, individuals were oriented such that the focal forewing
was in the same plane for imaging (mean ¼ 7.2 individuals per
species; 511 total measurements). Wing length was measured in
Image J (NIH). We analysed wing length as a response variable
in addition to using it as a measure of body size in models testing
for effects of nutrients on the relative size of traits.
Three reproductive measures were taken for field-caught indi-
viduals. For females, paired ovaries were dissected out in 1 PBS
buffer under approximately 20 magnification using a Leica
M165C microscope. All mature, chorionated eggs were counted
and egg size was measured for one to five eggs per individual
(mean ¼ 2.8 eggs per individual, 499 total eggs) as the area of
each mature egg. For egg measurements, we eliminated specimens
that were desiccated or had zero mature eggs (e.g. due to reproduc-
tive diapause), averaging egg measurements for 3.9 individuals
per species (195 total). For most male butterflies, the ancestrally
paired testes are fused into one testis. The single testis was dis-
sected out in 1 PBS and imaged. Testis size was measured as
the
area
of
the
testis
(mean ¼ 4
individuals
per
species;
192 total). Within butterflies, at least two reversions to paired
testes have occurred. For these species, testis investment was
measured as the summed area of each testis. For field-caught speci-
mens, we made efforts to sample both males and females (mean
sex ratio ¼ 0.81 females : males; see the electronic supplementary
material, file 1).
For museum specimens, we measured eye width (in addition
to wing length). Individuals were oriented face-on under the
microscope (as in [44]). Eye width was measured on each eye
as the distance from where the eye meets the head, to the furthest
distance from the midline. By measuring both eyes, we could use
asymmetry of the eye width measure to ensure that specimens
were oriented properly (for analysis, we excluded eye width
measurements that had an eye width difference of more than
25% of the average eye size). Eye width averaged across both
eyes was used in analyses. For museum specimens, we sought
to measure at least three females and three males per species
(mean females per species ¼ 3.46; mean males per species ¼
3.95; average sex ratio across species ¼ 0.87 females : males; see
the electronic supplementary material, file 1). Collection dates
of specimens ranged from 1899 to 2010. There were significant
differences
across species in
collection date (F69,430 ¼ 7.11,
p , 0.0001); however, a species’ collection date was not related
to eye size (F1,67 ¼ 0.67, p ¼ 0.42) or wing length (F1,68 ¼ 0.91,
p ¼ 0.34), suggesting changes in nutrient availability over time
were not affecting the development of our traits.
(d) Phylogeny
Because there is no comprehensive phylogeny for butterflies, we
constructed a phylogeny by combining available family- and
tribe-level phylogenies with a phylogeny giving relationships
among families [45]. We used a number of criteria when choosing
phylogenetic references. We preferred molecular phylogenies over
morphological and also preferred phylogenies containing more
species from our analysis. We used references that resolved
polytomies wherever possible. Relationships within Papilionidae
were taken from Simonsen et al. [46]. Relationships among Colias
and their close relatives were based on Pollock et al. [47]. Relation-
ships within Pierinae and Hesperiidae were taken from Braby &
Trueman [27] and Warren et al. [48,49], respectively. Relationships
within Nymphalidae were taken from a number of sources, includ-
ing [50–56]. Relationships within the Lycaenidae are not currently
well resolved. Relationships within the proposed sub-tribe Poly-
ommatina and Lycaena were taken from Talavera et al. [57] and
van Dorp [58], respectively, with clarifications from Eliot [59].
A few relationships within the Lycaenidae for which there were
no references were built based on current taxonomic classification.
(e) Timing of host shifts
Age, or timing, of a larval host shift, is an estimate of how long
the larvae of a given butterfly species have been feeding primar-
ily on the plant family in question. Specifically, we focus here on
whether the common ancestor of the entire genus most probably
fed on the plant family in question. We designate a ‘recent shift’
when a focal species primarily feeds on a different plant family
than the common ancestor of the genus. If the focal species pri-
marily feeds on the same plant family as the common ancestor
of the genus, we assume the host shift is relatively more ancient.
Determinations were made primarily using the HOSTS caterpil-
lar host-plant database [60] and [43]. Additional references for
individual host records include [27,43,46,61–71]. While the
ancestral determination was clear for most genera, a few required
significant interpretation (see
the electronic
supplementary
material, file 2).
(f) Data analysis
To assess the relationship between nutrition and life history, we
used mean life-history trait values for each species. Because ana-
lyses among species must consider the degree to which species
are related to one another, we performed phylogenetic general-
ized least-squares regressions with the ‘caper’ package [72] in
R v. 3.1.3 [73]. For each model, we allowed l, a measure of the
degree of phylogenetic autocorrelation, to take its maximum-
likelihood
estimate
(MLE).
Each
life-history
variable
was
analysed both in its body size-corrected form by including wing
length in the model (e.g. ‘relative eye width’) and its uncorrected
form (e.g. ‘absolute eye width’). Analysing data calculated from
males versus females did not qualitatively alter our results, so
the sexes were pooled for analyses of eye width and wing length.
We were interested in whether links between nutrition and
life history varied across butterfly families and between ancient
and recent host shifts. To each model, we first added an inter-
action
effect
between
the
nutrient
of
interest
and
either
butterfly family or host shift timing. We inspected the change
in the sample-size corrected Akaike’s information criterion
(DAICc) due to the additional term. If the DAICc was at least
two, we then took this to mean the model was improved
enough to account for the increase in the number of parameters
in the model. Family- and timing-specific analyses are presented
only if they improved the model fit.
4. Results
We made use of both museum specimens (n ¼ 68 species, 518
individuals) and wild-caught specimens (n ¼ 65 species, 644
individuals). Across all specimens, wing length was weakly
positively correlated with host plant sodium content (p ¼
0.07), but not nitrogen or phosphorus (figure 2; electronic sup-
plementary material, table S2). In subsequent analyses, we
consider both absolute values of life-history traits and trait
values relative to body size.
For field-caught specimens, we dissected out reproductive
tissue and measured total mature eggs, egg size and testis size.
Butterflies that feed on plant families higher in nitrogen had
higher fecundity, whether corrected ( p ¼ 0.06) or uncorrected
( p ¼ 0.03) for body size, although the relationship is weaker
for relative fecundity (figures 2 and 3; electronic supplemen-
tary material, table S1). Female butterflies that feed on plant
families with more nitrogen and phosphorus had smaller
eggs, but only when egg size was corrected for body size
( p ¼ 0.04 and 0.08, respectively; figure 2; electronic sup-
plementary material, tables S1 and S3). Neither absolute nor

relative testis size was influenced by any nutrient (figure 2; elec-
tronic supplementary material, tables S1–S3). For museum
specimens, nitrogen (p , 0.05) and sodium (p ¼ 0.009) were
both significantly positively related to absolute eye width,
but not relative eye width (figures 2 and 3; electronic
supplementary material, tables S1 and S2).
The relative effects of different nutrients varied across the
different butterfly families sampled. The effects of nitrogen
on fecundity were particularly pronounced within Pieridae
and Nymphalidae, while the effect of sodium on eye width
was pronounced within Lycaenidae (electronic supplementary
material, figure S4 and table S4). We only investigated relation-
ships within specific families when corrected AICc suggested
that including family improved the model (electronic sup-
plementary material, tables S1–S3). Although the measure
of phylogenetic signal (l) we estimated varied among
traits (electronic supplementary material, table S5), the traits
exhibiting important family-level variation did not show a
consistent pattern of phylogenetic autocorrelation. Rather,
the morphological traits exhibited moderate to high phylo-
genetic signal, while the fecundity-related traits exhibited
low phylogenetic signal.

We were additionally interested in whether the age of a
diet shift influenced the extent to which nutrition shaped
life-history traits. For our age variable, we classified diet
shifts as ‘ancient’ or ‘recent’ with regards to whether they
occurred before or after the diversification of the genus.
Using corrected AICc for model selection, we found that
the role of nutrition in shaping life-history traits did not
differ between ancient and recent host shifts (electronic
supplementary material, tables S1–S3).
5. Discussion
Our results support the idea that diet quality can shape
life-history evolution across species. There was a positive
relationship between host plant nitrogen content and fecundity
(figures 2 and 3), despite the fact that many of these species
have been adapting to a low nutrient diet for millions of
years. We also found that species feeding on more nitrogen-
rich, and to some extent phosphorus-rich, host plants had
eggs that were smaller relative to their body size (figures 2
and 3). Smaller relative egg size in response to a better quality
diet, in conjunction with higher fecundity suggests that these
species may be adopting a different reproductive strategy.
These species may invest relatively less in each individual off-
spring because the offspring will be feeding on higher nutrient
plants, thus allowing the parents to have higher fecundity.
Indeed, rearing experiments of several satyrine butterflies
suggest that egg size confers a larval survival advantage on
nitrogen-poor plants [74]. Unexpectedly, there were no signifi-
cant links between nutrition and testis size. This could reflect
strong selection on testis size such that males prioritize
allocation to this trait even on low nutrient diets (as for eyes
[75]); alternatively, noise from variation in sexual selection
intensity (e.g. re-mating rate [76]), may also be obscuring
a relationship.
We additionally found that species that feed on plant
families with higher nitrogen and sodium content had larger
eyes. In butterflies, vision is important for males to secure a
mate [35,36] and females to locate host plants [37,38], both
important components of fitness. These results speak to more
general ideas relating nutrition to brain evolution [10–12]
given that species with larger eyes probably also have greater
total neural investment. This is in part because 75% of the but-
terfly brain is dedicated to visual processing [77,78], and in part
due to correlations between eye size and the size of brain
regions dedicated to processing visual information in both
vertebrates and invertebrates [79,80].
Insects can often compensate for low nutrient diets through
changes in foraging behaviour, such as changes in feeding rate
or development time [81,82]. However, the fact that we see a
signature of nutrient content across some butterfly families
suggests that changes in feeding cannot fully compensate for
low nutrient diets (although it could explain some of the
added variation seen in figure 3). It is possible that high
larval mortality imposes significant costs to increases in devel-
opment time [83]. Indeed, the skipper family, which includes
one of the most successful butterfly radiations on a low nutri-
ent plant family (grasses) employs larval shelter building,
presumably an adaptation to avoid predation and parasitism
[84]. There may be additional costs to compensatory feeding,
such as increased exposure to toxins [85], which results in
species incompletely compensating for low nutrient diets.
Interestingly, some of the relationships between nutrition
and life-history traits varied across butterfly families. The
link between sodium and eye size was particularly strong
within Lycaenidae and the correlation between fecundity and
nitrogen was especially pronounced in Pieridae, and to some
extent, Nymphalidae (electronic supplementary materials,
figure S4 and table S4). It is possible that some adaptation to
diet, such as shelter building in skippers (see above), may
result in a family being less constrained by nutrition. It is
also possible that the ancestral diet of a family may pre-adapt
them to certain diet shifts. For instance, the ancestral hosts of
Pieridae were high-nitrogen legumes [27], which could explain
their poor performance on low nitrogen diets. It is also possible
that the subsample of hosts used by a particular family could
constrain statistical analyses across families. For instance, the
hosts of Lycaenidae span a much broader range of sodium
availability than the hosts of Papilionidae (figure 3).
Significant relationships between diet and life-history evol-
ution emerged in our analyses despite the challenges of
quantifying ‘nutrition’. We focused on elemental measures of
nutrient availability as a way to standardize fundamental nutri-
ent requirements across species, and because extensive data are
available on plant nutrient content. However, such an
approach glosses over the extent to which nutrients are bio-
available to a species, especially when nutrients are tied up
in plant defences. This is an important limitation to our results,
but still represents an increase in resolution over measures of
diet quality such as ‘herbivorous’ or ‘carnivorous’ (e.g. [86]).
Accounting for the true nutritional value of a resource will
remain challenging because what is bio-available depends on
the organism—for instance, nitrogen may be incorporated
into plant defences, which a specialist, but not a generalist,
may be able to metabolize [87]. Patterns linking plant nutrient
levels and herbivore life-history traits also emerged despite
considerable variability within plants in nutrient content,
whether due to geographical [39] or seasonal variation [8].
We were interested in whether the timing of a diet shift
influenced the relationship between nutrition and life-history
traits, reasoning that nutrition may be more likely to constrain
life-history evolution following a recent diet shift, prior to the
longer-term evolution of adaptations to that diet through
changes to gut morphology, metabolic adaptations or symbio-
tic associations [15–19]. We did not find any effect of timing on
the link between diet and life history (electronic supplementary
material, tables S1–S3). Of course, it is possible that this
negative result could be a consequence of our methods for
quantifying ‘timing’. We focused on host use at the level of but-
terfly genus because we were able to trace most diet shifts to
this level, and it seemed a likely level for such timing effects
to play out. ‘Recent’ shifts were classified as those that occurred
within a genus with respect to the ancestral host of that genus.
Given the age of some genera, the ‘recent shift’ classification
may still correspond to a very long timescale—20–40 million
years (e.g. [70]), no doubt an adequate period of time for
species to adapt to low nutrient diets. As phylogenetic infor-
mation becomes more resolved across butterflies, it may be
possible to gain more precise estimates of timing of host
shifts, allowing for tests of a timing signature at a finer scale.
Our research suggests that variation across species in
nutrient availability may sometimes explain variation in life
histories across species. In some cases, species with higher
quality diets can afford to allocate more to traits related to fit-
ness, such as fecundity and eye size, paralleling theory

linking resource availability and life-history traits within
species [3,14]. It is possible that nutrient availability across
species
is
obscuring
underlying
life-history
trade-offs
[3,14,22,88], although further analyses are necessary to test
this idea. As a result of this life-history variation, species that
differ in diet may vary systematically in major ecological and
evolutionary processes, such as survival in novel environments
[89] or rates of evolution and diversification [90]. Indeed, butter-
fly species specialized on more nitrogen rich larval diets have
shown more pronounced northward range expansions over
the last 40 years [91]. Our results are particularly important
given that humans are drastically altering the availability of
many once-limited nutrients, especially nitrogen, phosphorus
and sodium [21]. Anthropogenic increases in nutrient avail-
ability may have evolutionary impacts on the reproductive
strategies of a range of organisms. For instance, an evolutionary
increase in the fecundity of pest species could be one of many
unintended consequences of increases in fertilizer use and
atmospheric nitrogen deposition over the last 100 years.
