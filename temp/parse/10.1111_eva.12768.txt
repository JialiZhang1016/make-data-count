1 | INTRODUCTION
Population persistence in the face of human‐induced global change 
often requires tolerance to abrupt environmental stress. What 
is “stressful” depends largely on the environmental conditions to 
which a population has adapted. For example, high temperatures 
and low water availability in desert conditions would most likely kill 
organisms restricted to cool and wet places. However, natural pop‐
ulations are increasingly exposed to novel stressors (e.g., predators, 
pathogens, or environmental toxins) or more severe environmental 
stress than what they have previously faced (e.g., thermal extremes; 
Hoffmann & Sgro, 2011). Populations that are unable to tolerate 
novel or increased stress will likely show sharp fitness declines and 
are vulnerable to extirpation (Fagan & Holmes, 2006; Frankham, 
2005; Hoffmann & Hercus, 2000). Identifying the determinants of

Abstract
Environmental change can expose populations to unfamiliar stressors, and maladap‐
tive responses to those stressors may result in population declines or extirpation. 
Although gene flow is classically viewed as a cause of maladaptation, small and iso‐
lated populations experiencing high levels of drift and little gene flow may be con‐
strained in their evolutionary response to environmental change. We provide a case 
study using the model Trinidadian guppy system that illustrates the importance of 
considering gene flow and genetic drift when predicting (mal)adaptive response to 
acute stress. We compared population genomic patterns and acute stress responses 
of inbred guppy populations from headwater streams either with or without a recent 
history of gene flow from a more diverse mainstem population. Compared to “no‐
gene flow” analogues, we found that populations with recent gene flow showed 
higher genomic variation and increased stress tolerance—but only when exposed to 
a stress familiar to the mainstem population (heat shock). All headwater populations 
showed similar responses to a familiar stress in headwater environments (starvation) 
regardless of gene flow history, whereas exposure to an entirely unfamiliar stress 
(copper sulfate) showed population‐level variation unrelated to environment or re‐
cent evolutionary history. Our results suggest that (mal)adaptive responses to acutely 
stressful environments are determined in part by recent evolutionary history and in 
part by previous exposure. In some cases, gene flow may provide the variation 
needed to persist, and eventually adapt, in the face of novel stress.

population persistence, performance, and adaptive potential under 
increasingly stressful conditions is urgent, given the rapid increase in 
worldwide population extinctions (Ceballos, Ehrlich, & Dirzo, 2017; 
Urban, 2015).
Genetic drift in small and isolated populations can increase 
genetic load due to an increased frequency of deleterious alleles 
(Charlesworth & Charlesworth, 1987). The expectation that inbreed‐
ing depression will be more pronounced in stressful environments 
compared to benign conditions is generally supported (Armbruster 
& Reed, 2005; Fox & Reed, 2011; Nowak et al., 2007), though inbred 
populations may respond to stress differently depending on taxo‐
nomic lineage, history of inbreeding, and the type, duration, novelty, 
and severity of stress (Keller & Waller, 2002; Sandner & Matthies, 
2016). If effects of inbreeding depression are exacerbated under 
stress, the impacts of stress should be generally worse in popula‐
tions experiencing strong genetic drift. Despite ample literature 
testing heterozygosity–fitness correlations (Chapman, Nakagawa, 
Coltman, Slate, & Sheldon, 2009; Szulkin, Bierne, & David, 2010), the 
relationship between neutral population genetic diversity and stress 
response, specifically, is equivocal (Hoffmann & Daborn, 2007). 
However, it tends to be the case that individuals with increased het‐
erozygosity demonstrate a broader range of physiological tolerance 
and function relative to homozygous individuals (Chapman et al., 
2009; Danzmann, Ferguson, & Allendorf, 1988; Forcada & Hoffman, 
2014; Samollow & Soulé, 1983). Given increasingly small and iso‐
lated populations caused by habitat loss and fragmentation, there is 
a necessity to further understand generalizability of inbreeding–en‐
vironment relationships as well as how populations are constrained 
by the loss of genetic variation (Pauls, Nowak, Bálint, & Pfenninger, 
2013).
Gene flow is often considered a source of maladaptation be‐
cause it can limit genetic and phenotypic differentiation and re‐
duce mean fitness in a population that receives immigration of 
locally maladapted alleles (Garcia‐Ramos & Kirkpatrick, 1997; 
Hendry, Day, & Taylor, 2001; Lenormand, 2002). However, the fit‐
ness effects of gene flow depend on demography of the recipient 
population and stability of the environment (Holt & Gomulkiewicz, 
1997; Sexton, Hangartner, & Hoffmann, 2014), as well as the 
shape and steepness of environmental gradients (Bridle, Kawata, 
& Butlin, 2019). The same level of gene flow that homogenizes 
and limits adaptation under one set of conditions (i.e., migration–
selection balance between medium to large populations in stable 
environments; King & Lawson, 1995; Hendry & Taylor, 2004; Nosil 
& Crespi, 2004) may promote adaptive divergence under a dif‐
ferent set of conditions (i.e., evolutionary rescue in stressful or 
rapidly changing environments; Willi, Kleunen, Dietrich, & Fischer, 
2007; Aitken & Whitlock, 2013; Apgar, Pearse, & Palkovacs, 2017). 
Increasing empirical evidence suggests that recently fragmented 
populations with reduced population sizes stand to receive a demo‐
graphic benefit from gene flow beyond the addition of immigrant 
individuals through genetic rescue (Frankham, 2015; Hufbauer et 
al., 2015; Whiteley, Fitzpatrick, Funk, & Tallmon, 2015). However, 
the extent to which new gene flow determines capacity to 
withstand and eventually adapt to stressful environments in the 
wild has not been explored. If new gene flow provides a means 
of recovery from inbreeding depression, these populations may 
show an increased capacity to handle stressful conditions com‐
pared to no‐gene flow analogues (i.e., Figure 1b,c vs. Figure 1e,f). 
On the other hand, if immigration comes from an environment 
that has not previously encountered a stress that is common in 
the recipient environment, homogenizing gene flow may constrain 
locally adaptive stress response (Figure 1a vs. Figure 1d). Here, we 
provide a case study using Trinidadian guppies, highlighting that 
gene flow may counteract maladaptive responses to abrupt stress, 
especially when populations are otherwise constrained by a lack 
of genetic variation.
Trinidadian guppies are a model system in evolutionary ecology 
(Magurran, 2005), used for studies on behavior (Hughes, Houde, 
Price, & Rodd, 2013), rapid adaptation (Reznick, Bryga, & Endler, 
1990), and eco‐evolutionary feedbacks (Travis et al., 2014). Guppies 
have also been used to study organismal stress responses to pre‐
dation (Fischer, Harris, Hofmann, & Hoke, 2014), chemical toxicity 
(Park & Heo, 2009), temperature (Muñoz, Breckels, & Neff, 2012), 
and hypoxia (Poulin, Wolf, & Kramer, 1987), as well as for test‐
ing phenotypic and fitness effects of inbreeding (e.g., Sheridan & 
Pomiankowski, 1997; van Oosterhout et al., 2003). The only study 
we know of that explicitly tests inbreeding–stress relationships in 
guppies examined pathogen resistance, documenting higher parasite 
intensity and less ability to clear the infection in inbred individuals 
compared to outbred fish (Smallbone, Oosterhout, & Cable, 2016).
Wild guppy populations found in headwater streams in Trinidad 
are known to harbor low levels of genetic variation due to founder 
effects and subsequent isolation by waterfall barriers (Crispo, 
Bentzen, Reznick, Kinnison, & Hendry, 2005; Suk & Neff, 2009; 
Willing et al., 2010). Waterfalls also limit upstream dispersal of most 
predatory fish species, resulting in low levels of predation mortality 
in these environments (Reznick, Butler, Rodd, & Ross, 1996). Guppy 
populations in headwater streams are characterized by higher den‐
sities (Reznick & Bryant, 2007; Reznick, Butler, & Rodd, 2001) and 
resource limitation (Grether, Millie, Bryant, & Reznick, 2001), and as 
a result are better adapted to high population densities than gup‐
pies from resource‐rich mainstem environments (Bassar et al., 2010; 
Reznick, Bassar, Travis, & Helen Rodd, 2012). This study leveraged 
a set of previous translocation experiments that occurred in 2009 
(Travis et al., 2014), which initiated gene flow from differentiated 
guppy populations into two recipient headwater populations with 
previously low levels of genetic variation. New gene flow caused 
substantial increases in population growth owing to high hybrid 
fitness, but mostly did not cause the loss of locally adapted traits 
(Fitzpatrick et al., 2016, 2017; Fitzpatrick, Gerberich, Kronenberger, 
Angeloni, & Funk, 2015).
Here, we tested acute stress responses and characterized popu‐
lation genomic differences among small populations found in similar 
headwater environments with different recent evolutionary his‐
tories (i.e., recent gene flow vs. genetic drift). Previous work doc‐
umented increased genetic variation following gene flow from the

upstream translocations using microsatellite data (Fitzpatrick et al., 
2016). However, for the research described here, we were especially 
interested in comparisons between the populations that experienced 
recent gene flow versus no‐gene flow analogues. Specifically, in this 
study, we compared stress responses among gene flow recipient 
populations and the gene flow source population from Fitzpatrick 
et al. (2016) as well as several headwater guppy populations without 
a recent history of gene flow that had not been characterized in the 
previous study. We tested for population‐level differences in stress 
response to three acute stressors: (a) heat shock; (b) starvation; and 
(c) exposure to a novel metal toxin (copper sulfate). This set of stress‐
ors represented a range of conceivable environmental perturbations 
that could be relatively easily administered and offered quantifiable 
responses.
We hypothesized that stress response would depend on recent 
evolutionary history (gene flow vs. no gene flow) and whether pop‐
ulations had previous exposure to the stress (Figure 1). High tem‐
peratures should be novel to headwater populations that occupy 
cooler waters. However, the gene flow source population origi‐
nated from a warmer downstream environment, so we predicted 
populations with a recent history of gene flow would show higher 
thermal tolerances, possibly due to the introduction of heat‐tol‐
erant alleles (Figure 1b) or due to an overall increase in genetic 
variation (Figure 1c). We predicted previous exposure to low‐re‐
source environments would lead to higher starvation tolerance in 
headwater populations (Figure 1d), though gene flow populations 
may show reduced tolerance due to genomic homogenization from 
a population adapted to a high resource environment (Figure 1a). 
Finally, we predicted gene flow populations would show highest 
tolerance to the metal toxin due to broadly increased physiological 
capacity caused by an increase in genomic variation and reduction 
in inbreeding (Figure 1c).
We also generated genomic data from all populations to charac‐
terize genetic factors that we would expect to influence responses 
to stress. We used this genomic data to characterize (a) population 
genomic diversity and differentiation, with the expectation that

selective pressures may maintain regions of genomic divergence (de‐
tectable as FST outliers) that could preserve adaptations to headwa‐
ter‐specific stressors, potentially even in the face of gene flow.
2 | METHODS
2.1 | Site descriptions and sampling
In October 2015, we collected 65 adult male Trinidadian guppies 
(Poecilia reticulata Peters) using butterfly nets from each of six lo‐
cations on the south slope of the Northern Range mountains in 
Trinidad. The comparison we were most interested in was between 
populations that experienced recent human‐mediated gene flow 
(Caigual‐CA and Taylor‐TY) and populations in similar environ‐
ments that did not have a recent history of gene flow (Naranjo‐NJ, 
Quare‐QU, and Tumbassun‐TU). These five populations were all 
from low‐order headwater streams with highly similar abiotic and 
biotic properties (Figure 2a; Table 1). These are considered “low‐pre‐
dation” sites because they are located above waterfalls and harbor 
simple fish communities that lack the major piscivorous predators 
such as Crenicichla alta  found in lowland rivers. These upstream sites 
are also characterized by low‐resource availability due to thick for‐
est canopy cover and high guppy densities. In general, abiotic and 
biotic variation among headwater sites is much less than variation 
between headwater and mainstem environments (Grether et al., 
2001; Magurran, 2005). From these five headwater sites, we col‐
lected individuals at the upstream‐most extent of where guppies 
could be accessed in order to target the populations that should 
be experiencing highest genetic drift and harbor lowest levels of 
within‐stream genetic variation (Baillie, 2012). The sixth site where 
guppies were collected (Guanapo‐GP) is a mainstem locality from 
the same drainage as CA, TY, and TU. This lowland site is character‐
ized by higher water temperatures, high resources, and high levels 
of predation (Gilliam, Fraser, & Alkins‐Koo, 1993; Torres Dowdall et 
al., 2012). We included the GP site because 150 guppies originat‐
ing from this site were introduced upstream of CA and TY in 2009 
(see Travis et al., 2014), leading to ~20 generations of gene flow and 
admixture between GP × TY and GP × CA populations (Fitzpatrick 
et al., 2016, 2015).
In future work, it will be important to evaluate acute stress re‐
sponse of both sexes, especially given that sex‐specific responses 
to stressors such as temperature are common (Baer & Travis, 2000). 
However, in this study we collected only mature males to avoid con‐
founding effects of female pregnancy in assessing stress responses. 
Male maturity was confirmed under a microscope by determining 
that the apical hood was even with or beyond the tip of the go‐
nopodium. Fish were transported to the laboratory in Nalgene® 
(Rochester, NY, USA) bottles filled with local stream water and held 
in individual, aerated tanks. All individuals were anesthetized in di‐
lute MS‐222, weighed, and photographed on the day of capture to 
estimate initial body condition (weight divided by standard length). 
Photographs were taken of fish spread laterally on a white back‐
ground alongside a metric ruler using a Canon EOS Rebel XSi SLR 
digital camera (Canon U.S.A., Inc., Melville, NY, USA).
2.2 | Stress exposure experiments
All experimental procedures took place at Jogi Ramal's tropical field 
station in Verdant Vale, Trinidad. We randomly assigned each of the 
65 male guppies per population to one of three acute stress expo‐
sure experiments: (a) maximum temperature tolerance (30 guppies/
population), (b) starvation (20 guppies/population), or (c) toxicity (15 
guppies/population). All fish were held in constant laboratory envi‐
ronment conditions for two nights and one full day before experi‐
ments began.
Maximum temperature tolerance in guppy populations was 
determined by estimating critical thermal maximum (CTM) for 30

guppies per population. Guppies were starved for one day prior 
to the CTM experiments to avoid energy expenditure for diges‐
tion during the experiment. We used an insulated rectangular 
(34.5 × 21.1 × 56.6 cm) Coleman 25‐quart cooler filled with a con‐
stant volume (7.6 L) of water that was circulated with a 2.8 watt 
Rio Plus 90 Aqua pump and aerated with two air stones. We tested 
six guppies per CTM assay, randomly placing each individual into a 
mesh container that was secured to the bottom of the cooler. After 
a 5‐min adjustment period, water was heated at a constant rate of 
0.4°C/min with two immersion coils connected to a PHC Enterprise 
voltage transformer set to 75 V. Temperature was recorded with 
a handheld YSI® Pro20 Multiparameter Meter (YSI Incorporated, 
Yellow Springs, OH). CTM was recorded as the temperature at which 
an individual showed initial loss of equilibrium. Usually, this point 
was preceded by several muscle spasms. As soon as a guppy reached 
CTM, it was removed with a plastic spoon and placed into a recovery 
tank. Three fish did not recover from the CTM experiment and were 
not included in analyses.
To assess population differences in the ability to withstand 
low‐resource environments, we starved individually housed gup‐
pies for 120 hr. We based this interval on a previous study that 
used a similar duration for its guppy starvation treatment (Bowes, 
Lafferty, & Thorp, 2014) as well as the observation that in the wet 
season headwater streams tend to have high stream‐flow events 
every 5 days on average (Kohler et al., 2012). We calculated body 
condition at the start of the experiment (0 hr) and again after 
120 hr without any food. To determine whether starvation over 
this duration would produce any measurable effects on body con‐
dition, we included a set of five randomly assigned control guppies 
per population that were held in exactly the same conditions with 
the exception of being fed ground Tetramin® tropical fish flakes 
(Spectrum Brands, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) ad lib once a day at 18:00. 
We measured body condition of control fish before and after 
120 hr. To standardize the effects of starvation across individuals 
and populations, we quantified a starvation index for each indi‐
vidual, defined as body condition at 0 hr minus body condition at 
120 hr. A positive starvation index at the end of the experiment 
indicated a reduction in body condition, whereas negative values 
indicate the fish gained weight. Thus, we interpreted higher values 
of starvation index as corresponding to worsened ability to cope 
with a lack of resources. We used a Welch two sample t test to de‐
termine whether fish that were starved had overall higher starva‐
tion indices than control fish that were fed during the experiment. 
Although groups had unequal sample sizes, assumptions of equal 
variance and normality were met.
Finally, we evaluated resistance to exposure to toxicity by 
subjecting group tanks to a toxic level of copper sulfate (CuSO4). 
Anthropogenic sources of copper pollution appear in aquatic sys‐
tems from mine washing, agricultural leaching, and direct application 
as algaecide and molluscicide (Helfman, 2007). Given the remote lo‐
cation of the headwater guppy sites in our study, it is unlikely the 
focal populations had any previous exposure to the metal toxin. In 
this experiment, 15 males per population were held in group tanks 
separated by population with 4 L of water treated with slightly 
less than the previously established LC50 level of CuSO4 for gup‐
pies (0.05 mg/L compared to 1.17 mg/L established by Park & Heo, 
2009). Tanks were aerated and also treated with STRESS COAT® 
(API, Mars Fishcare) and AmQuel PLUS® (Kordon, Oakland, CA). 
Guppies in the toxicity experiment were fed ground fish flakes ad 
lib once a day at 18:00 p.m. Tanks were checked every 12 hr and 
dead fish were removed. We assessed the survival rate for each tank 
after 96 hr.

muscle tissue using QiagenTM DNeasy Blood & Tissue extraction kits 
and quantified using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kit (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific). A single RAD library was prepared with 96 individuals 
(Table 1) following the bestRAD protocol (Ali et al., 2016). Briefly, 
we normalized DNA from every sample to a final concentration of 
150 ng in a 10 μl volume, digested DNA using the SbfI restriction 
enzyme (New England Biolabs, NEB), and ligated digested samples 
to individually barcoded adapters. Samples were pooled and sheared 
to an average length of 500 bp on a Covaris sonicator. We used the 
Illumina NEBNext Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit to repair blunt ends 
and ligate NEBNext Adaptors onto DNA fragments. Agencourt® 
AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) were used to size select from 
the DNA fragments with an average of 600 bp. The final library was 
submitted to the RTSF Genomics Core at Michigan State University 
and sequenced in one lane with paired‐end 150‐bp reads on an 
Illumina HiSeq 4000.
2.4 | Acute stress analyses
We used linear mixed models to analyze the effects of population 
differences on CTM and starvation index. For modeling variation 
in CTM, we used stream as the fixed factor. Initial weight was in‐
cluded as a random effect as were hierarchically nested factors of 
CTM run and container position. For modeling variation in starvation 
index, we used stream as the fixed factor and included initial weight 
as a random effect. Both CTM and starvation index were modeled 
using maximum likelihood, and significance of the population effect 
was tested using likelihood ratio tests against the null model that 
included only random effects. Residual plots were used to deter‐
mine whether model assumptions of normality and homoscedastic‐
ity were met. All models were carried out with package “lme4” in 
R (Bates & Maechler, 2009). To evaluate the effects of gene flow 
on resistance to the novel copper sulfate stress, we used interval‐
censored survival methods (Finkelstein, 1986). We coded each in‐
dividual tested in the copper sulfate trials as either perishing at an 
unknown time between two tank checks or surviving to the end of 
the trial (right‐censored). We fit survival curves and tested for dif‐
ferences in survival distributions among groups using a chi‐square 
permutation test based on logrank scores in the R package “interval” 
(Fay & Shaw, 2010). We conducted two analyses using two different 
grouping schemes, one which considered each of the six populations 
as a separate group (to identify whether individual populations dif‐
fered significantly in survival after copper sulfate exposure) and an‐
other which split individuals into three groups by origin in either the 
mainstem source population, headwater populations with a recent 
history of gene flow, or headwater populations with no gene flow (to 
test whether gene flow treatment affected survival).
2.5 | RADseq analyses
We used Stacks (Catchen, Hohenlohe, Bassham, Amores, & Cresko, 
2013) to demultiplex, filter, and trim adapters from the sequenc‐
ing data with the process_radtags function. We required a perfect 
barcode and partial restriction site match. We removed duplicate 
read pairs using the clone_filter function in Stacks. Forward‐read 
sequences were aligned to the Trinidadian guppy genome assembly 
(Künstner et al., 2016) using GSnap (Wu & Watanabe, 2005). We 
required unique alignments, allowing for a maximum of five mis‐
matches, the presence of up to two indels, and no terminal align‐
ments. Reference‐aligned reads were analyzed using the ref_map 
function in Stacks to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) and call genotypes. We kept only SNPs that were present in 
all six populations and genotyped in at least 60% of the individuals. 
We also removed several individuals which had fewer than 1,000 loci 
in the final dataset and removed loci with a minor allele frequency 
<0.05 using VCFtools v0.1.12a (Danecek et al., 2011). In total, we 
identified 23,667 SNPs that met our filtering criteria.
2.6 | Genome‐wide genetic diversity and divergence
We used the R package PopGenome v2.2.4 (Pfeifer, Wittelsbürger, 
Ramos‐Onsins, & Lercher, 2014) to characterize genome‐wide nu‐
cleotide diversity and pairwise genetic divergence (FST) between the 
source population (GP) and the other populations (including those 
with and without a history of gene flow). We calculated both statis‐
tics over adjacent 50‐snp windows and plotted diversity and pair‐
wise FST using local regression (LOESS; Cleveland, 1979) over each 
chromosome. We conducted a principal component analysis (PCA) 
on the genomic data using the R package adegenet v.2.1.1 (Jombart, 
2008). We performed one PCA analysis using all populations and an‐
other PCA analysis using only populations in the Guanapo drainage 
(CA, GP, TU, TY) to detect fine‐scale differences within this drain‐
age. We visualized PCA results using the first two principal compo‐
nents as X and Y coordinates.
2.7 | Inbreeding
We used multiple methods to characterize inbreeding for the study 
populations. We calculated genome‐wide inbreeding coefficients 
(F) using VCFtools for each individual. We characterized variation in 
inbreeding among individuals using g2, a metric of correlation of het‐
erozygosity across markers (David, Pujol, Viard, Castella, & Goudet, 
2007; Miller & Coltman, 2014), for each population as well as for 
all populations combined using the inbreedR package (Stoffel et al., 
2016). Finally, we used PLINK v1.07 (Purcell et al., 2007) to identify 
long runs of homozygosity (LROH) for each individual. We used slid‐
ing windows of 100 SNPs and we set the minimum size of LROH to 
1 Mb, with a maximum gap of 500 kb, 1 heterozygote allowed per 
LROH, and 10 missing loci allowed per LROH.
2.8 | Outliers
To find loci potentially associated with maintenance of local adapta‐
tion in headwater populations with a history of gene flow from the 
mainstem source, we identified outlier loci exhibiting higher diver‐
gence than expected using BayeScan v2.1 (Foll & Gaggiotti, 2008).

FITZPATRICK and REID
We used default settings for the MCMC chain (20 pilot runs, first 
50,000 runs discarded as burn‐in, thinning interval of 10, and 5,000 
outputted iterations) and a prior odds of 10 for the neutral model. 
We conducted one run using allele frequencies for all populations 
with a known history of gene flow from the mainstem source (GP, 
CA, and TY) as well as one run with all populations in the same drain‐
age as GP (GP, CA, TY, and TU). We used a false discovery rate of 
0.05 to identify the loci with the best evidence for association with 
adaptive divergence between the headwater and mainstem popula‐
tions. For each SNP locus identified as an outlier, we examined al‐
lele frequencies in both the mainstem population and the headwater 
populations in the same drainage to identify patterns of genetic vari‐
ability potentially associated with local adaptation to headwater en‐
vironments. Finally, we used the NCBI Genome Data Viewer for the 
published Poecilia reticulata genome to identify the position of each 
SNP relative to nearby genes in order to identify potential functional 
importance of these outliers.
3 | RESULTS
3.1 | Stress exposure
We found that guppy populations differed in their responses to 
acute stressors and with respect to each stress type. Despite 
cooler water temperatures in all headwater environments (Table 1), 
the two sites that previously received gene flow showed highest 
thermal tolerances and were significantly different from other 
headwater populations, but not different from the Guanapo (GP) 
mainstem site that provided the source of gene flow (Figure 3a). 
Thermal tolerance of Naranjo (NJ) fish was significantly lower than 
it was for Tumbassun (TU) fish, while this tolerance was intermedi‐
ate for Quare (QU) fish.
We confirmed that guppies that experienced starvation had 
higher overall starvation indices than those that were fed in con‐
trol treatments, t(40) = −8.61, p < 0.0001. All headwater populations

started with higher body condition compared to Guanapo (GP) gup‐
pies from the lowland mainstem site; however, Tumbassun (TU) gup‐
pies had significantly higher body condition than all other headwater 
populations (Supporting Information Figure S1). Headwater popu‐
lations tended to withstand starvation stress better than the main‐
stem Guanapo population, although the only significant difference 
was between Guanapo and Quare (Figure 3b).
Finally, we documented substantial variation among popula‐
tions with respect to survival rate when exposed to copper sulfate 
(Figure 4). The two populations that previously received gene flow 
highlighted two extremes with only 20% survival rate in Caigual 
compared to 100% survival rate in Taylor after 96 hr exposure. One 
other population (Quare) had 100% survival and the three remain‐
ing populations were intermediate, ranging from 50% to 80% sur‐
vival. Survival distributions differed significantly among populations 
(Figure 4; χ2 = 38.74, p < 1 × 10−6) but not among the source, gene 
flow, and no gene flow groups (Supporting Information Figure S2; 
χ2 = 3.32, p = 0.1906).
3.2 | Genome‐wide genetic divergence and diversity
Per‐SNP nucleotide diversity was highest for the Guanapo (GP) 
mainstem source site (mean = 0.20, range 0.08–0.31) and lowest for 
headwater populations Tumbassun (TU mean = 0.03, range 0–0.20) 
and Naranjo (NJ mean = 0.02, range 0–0.23) with no recent history 
of gene flow. Headwater populations that experienced recent gene 
flow from the GP source exhibited diversity similar to that of the 
source (CA mean = 0.17, range 0.05–0.30; TY mean = 0.17, range 
0.04–0.30), and headwater population QU also exhibited intermedi‐
ate diversity (mean = 0.14, range 0–0.28) despite no known recent 
history of gene flow (Figure 5a).
For the PCA analysis using all individuals, the first two com‐
ponents explained 37.6% and 25.3% of the variability in the data, 
with all other components explaining <5% of the variability. Based 
on these first two components, individuals from populations NJ and 
QU were highly distinct from both each other and from individuals in 
the Guanapo drainage (Figure 2b). For the PCA analysis restricted to 
the Guanapo drainage, the first two components explained less vari‐
ability (11% and 4% of variability). The first axis differentiated the 
no gene flow population (TU) from the source population and from 
the populations that previously received gene flow from the source, 
with remaining axes mostly explaining variability in the source pop‐
ulation. Individuals from CA and TY were clustered closely together, 
while individuals from the GP source population exhibited more vari‐
ability (Figure 2c).
FST was highest between GP and headwater populations in other 
drainages (GP‐NJ FST mean = 0.71, range 0.29–0.91; GP‐QU FST 
mean = 0.66, range 0.31–0.90), intermediate between GP and the 
headwater population in the same drainage with no gene flow (GP‐
TU FST mean = 0.36, range 0.001–0.74), and low between GP and 
the populations with a history of gene flow from GP (GP‐CA mean 
FST = 0.02, range −0.06 to 0.18; GP‐TY mean FST = 0.03, range −0.08 
to 0.16; Figure 5b).
3.3 | Inbreeding
Individual inbreeding estimates were lowest for GP (mean 
F = 0.33, range 0.21–0.51) and highest for the two headwater 
populations that exhibited lowest nucleotide diversity (NJ mean 
F = 0.90, range 0.88–0.92; TU mean F = 0.90, range 0.89 to 0.92; 
Figure 6a). Populations that received gene flow from the main‐
stem GP population exhibited individual inbreeding near that of 
the source (CA mean F = 0.45, range 0.42–0.60; TY mean F = 0.46, 
range 0.42–0.52). Variation in inbreeding was high across popu‐
lations (g2 = 0.271) and generally near zero within populations 
(Figure 6b). Individuals in headwater populations with high average 
F values tended to exhibit many long runs of homozygosity (LROH) 
(>50) with high average LROH length (>6 Mb; Figure 6c). In con‐
trast, most individuals from the mainstem GP population exhibited 
no detectable LROH. Populations with a recent history of gene

3.4 | Outliers
Both BayeScan analyses identified the same set of five loci as outli‐
ers with a false discovery rate of 0.05. All of these loci were variable 
in the mainstem GP population but fixed in headwater populations. 
Three loci were distributed throughout the genome (linkage groups 
1, 5, and 8), while two were in close association with one another 
(<100 kb apart) on linkage group 17. Three of the five loci were 
found within intronic regions of protein‐coding genes (Supporting 
Information Table S1), with functions in skin pigmentation (gene 
bnc1, linkage group 1), endoplasmic reticulum function (gene emc10, 
linkage group 8), and cyclic AMP production/signaling cascades 
(gene adcy8, linkage group 17).
4 | DISCUSSION
Small populations with high genetic load may be constrained in their 
ability to withstand abrupt environmental stress. Gene flow may 
ameliorate these genetic constraints by reducing inbreeding depres‐
sion and introducing adaptive alleles, or could decrease fitness by 
introducing maladaptive alleles. We found higher genomic variation 
and less inbreeding in headwater populations with a history of re‐
cent gene flow compared to populations without recent gene flow. 
Populations with gene flow either outperformed or performed simi‐
larly to "no‐gene flow" analogues when exposed to familiar stressors, 
but did not show a consistent response to a novel stress. We discuss 
these results in light of the following generalizations: (a) inbreeding 
depression is often worse under stressful conditions (Armbruster & 
Reed, 2005); (b) gene flow can relieve genetic load but may intro‐
duce maladaptive alleles (Slatkin, 1985); and (c) many natural popula‐
tions are in decline, increasingly isolated, and subjected to new and 
more extreme stress (Frankham et al., 2017). The extent to which 
reduced genetic variation imposes physiological constraints to stress 
tolerance, and how gene flow relieves those constraints is not cur‐
rently known.
Local adaptation and inbreeding may create interactive effects 
that compound maladaptation to certain stresses. For example, the 
ability to tolerate extreme temperatures is mechanistically tied to 
upregulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs), and populations expe‐
riencing different levels of heat stress in their natural environment 
exhibit differences in their ability to respond to heat stress through 
upregulation of HSPs (Feder & Hofmann, 1999; in fish, Narum & 
Campbell, 2015). Evidence for heritable genetic variation in HSP ex‐
pression (marine turtles; Tedeschi et al., 2016) and local adaptation 
to heat stress (in corals; Bay & Palumbi, 2014; Dixon et al., 2015) 
suggests that selective forces can tune the transcriptional heat 
shock response according to local thermal conditions. However, 
there is also evidence that inbreeding alone can interfere with the 
expression of HSPs and heat shock responses (in insects; Pedersen, 
Kristensen, & Loeschcke, 2005; Franke & Fischer, 2015), suggesting 
that local adaptation may be insufficient to deal with heat stress in 
small populations. A broad knowledge of population history (in terms 
of past inbreeding, gene flow, and local conditions) may thus be use‐
ful in understanding and predicting how increasing temperatures 
affect small populations.
In this study, headwater populations with no history of gene flow 
were all maladapted to heat stress in comparison with the mainstem 
population from a warmer environment. While genomic data indi‐
cated that populations without a history of gene flow varied in their 
degree of inbreeding and level of genetic diversity, the degree of 
maladaptation in these populations did not seem to depend strongly 
on the degree of inbreeding, as two highly inbred populations (NJ 
and TU) exhibited critical thermal maximums (CTMs) similar to a 
more outbred population (QU). As such, maladaptation to heat stress 
in this case seems to be tied more to local selective forces than ran‐
dom drift. However, headwater populations that had experienced 
recent gene flow exhibited CTMs similar to the source population, 
indicating that gene flow alleviated maladaptation to heat stress in 
this case, fitting the predicted scenario in Figure 1b. It is important 
to note here that the recipient and source populations originated 
from the same drainage, and as such we cannot state with certainty 
whether gene flow per se from any population would alleviate heat 
stress response or whether the specific alleles contributed from the 
source used in this case were responsible. Further investigation into 
the specific mechanism by which gene flow alleviates maladaptation 
to heat stress would be useful for better understanding how gene 
flow affects stress responses. Specifically, understanding transcrip‐
tional responses to stress in populations with varying histories of 
gene flow and inbreeding would be useful. Previous work has shown 
that local adaptation to heat stress can be highly polygenic (Bay & 
Palumbi, 2014), which would suggest that exchange of alleles across 
the whole genome rather than in specific regions would be particu‐
larly helpful in alleviating maladaptation to heat stress.
While this result shows that gene flow can alleviate maladapta‐
tion to some stresses, particularly stresses that are familiar to the 
source population, theory predicts that gene flow should aggravate 
maladaptation to stresses that are unfamiliar to the source popu‐
lation by homogenizing allele frequencies among populations and 
thus disrupting locally adapted differences in allele frequency in the 
recipient population (Lenormand, 2002; Rasanen & Hendry, 2008). 
We expected to see this effect with regard to a stress familiar to 
low‐resource adapted headwater populations (starvation). However, 
in this case gene flow did not seem to aggravate maladaptation, as 
the mainstem population (adapted to a high resource environment) 
was maladapted to starvation relative to all headwater popula‐
tions, regardless of gene flow history. This result has two possible 
explanations that we cannot distinguish in our study: (a) headwa‐
ter × mainstem hybrids are more plastic in starvation response than 
pure mainstem genotypes; or (2) strong selective forces maintained 
differences in allele frequencies in headwater populations at loci 
that confer adaptation to low‐resource levels. The existence of 
FST outliers provides support for the latter explanation, although 
increased plasticity may also contribute. Constant high gene flow 
between heterogeneous environments is expected to increase plas‐
ticity (Crispo, 2008; Lind, Ingvarsson, Johansson, Hall, & Johansson, 
 17524571, 2019, 7, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eva.12768, Wiley Online Library on [31/03/2025].

2011; Sultan & Spencer, 2002), but interactions between new gene 
flow, inbreeding, and plastic stress response are poorly understood. 
Experimental studies that manipulate gene flow and inbreeding and 
test short‐term stress response and long‐term adaptive potential 
would improve understanding of these complex interactions.
The existence of outlier alleles that remained fixed in headwa‐
ter populations despite gene flow from the diverse source popula‐
tion suggests possible maintenance of some locally adaptive alleles. 
The repeated and independent evolution of the classic low‐preda‐
tion guppy phenotype (i.e., slow life history and large body size) in 
headwater environments is thought to be largely a result of density‐
dependent selection driven by low‐resource availability and high 
population densities (Travis et al., 2014). In this study, we are unable 
to determine whether outlier‐identified alleles underlie increased 
tolerance to starvation. Nonetheless, it is likely that strong selection 
in headwater environments maintains genetic adaptations to low 
resources and high population densities. In Drosophila, starvation re‐
sults in a large number of transcriptional changes throughout the ge‐
nome, and starvation‐resistant populations show different patterns 
of regulation than nonresistant populations (Harbison, Yamamoto, 
Fanara, Norga, & Mackay, 2004). These differences in regulation, 
however, appear to be related to a small number of quantitative trait 
loci (~12), potentially involving genes that have broad regulatory ef‐
fects (Harbison, Chang, Kamdar, & Mackay, 2005). Selection acting 
on starvation‐related regulatory loci is therefore a possible mech‐
anism for the maintenance of local adaptation in headwater pop‐
ulations of guppies. Studies quantifying transcriptional changes in 
guppies under starvation as well as fine mapping of loci responsible 
for variability in starvation resistance would be a means of evaluat‐
ing this mechanism.
Reactions to novel stressors in small populations are related to 
a population's history of inbreeding as well as the variability of the 
environment during inbreeding. For example, inbred populations 
that have experienced more variable environments tend to be better 
able to cope with novel stress (Reed, Lowe, Briscoe, & Frankham, 
2003). Contrary to the hypothesis that variation provided by gene 
flow would confer higher tolerance to a novel stress, in our study 
populations the degree of maladaptation to a novel stress (cop‐
per) seemed to follow a pattern unrelated to genetic diversity or 
divergence among populations. High resistance to copper expo‐
sure in TY, a population inhabiting an especially flood‐prone and 
resource‐poor headwater stream environment (Fitzpatrick, Torres 
Dowdall, Reznick, Ghalambor, & Funk, 2014), supported a relation‐
ship between environmental variability and response to novel stress. 
However, the extreme difference in response between TY and CA, 
both of which experienced homogenizing gene flow from the same 
source, is difficult to explain. Resistance to novel stress can show 
strong lineage effects (Reed, Briscoe, & Frankham, 2002), suggesting 
that founder effects could be involved in determining response to 
novel stressors in isolated headwater populations. Copper ions are 
highly toxic to fish; accumulation of copper in gill, kidney, and liver 
tissues has been shown to affect tissue and cellular morphology as 
well as physiological function in several species (Benoit, 1975; De 
Boeck et al., 2001; Brungs, Leonard, & McKim, 1973). Determining 
the histological and genetic mechanisms that conferred survival to 
acute copper poisoning in these populations would be informative 
for understanding how fish resist heavy metals. Studies conducted 
in fish as well as in invertebrates have independently identified 
several genes associated with resistance to heavy metals, includ‐
ing copper, is associated with changes in the expression of several 
genes, including metallothioneins which bind metal ions (Hamilton & 
Mehrle, 1986; Roesijadi, 1992) and transport proteins such as ATP7a 
(Camakaris et al., 1995) and ABC transporters (Broeks, Gerrard, 
Allikmets, Dean, & Plasterk, 1996; Long, Li, & Cui, 2010) that move 
metal ions out of the cell, making these ideal candidates for genes 
conferring resistance to copper stress and potential targets for fu‐
ture study.
Our case study adds to the generalization that effects of gene 
flow are trait specific, but also suggests that some trait responses 
(such as thermal tolerance and starvation) may be predictable based 
on previous exposure of source and recipient populations. The abil‐
ity to cope with increased and novel stresses will be extremely im‐
portant in determining the fate of small populations in a changing 
world (Hoffmann & Sgro, 2011). Determining how the loss of genetic 
variation in small populations affects short‐term stress response 
and long‐term adaptive potential to environmental change is an ur‐
gent concern (Frankham et al., 2017). Other studies have identified 
a tension between conservation interventions designed to bolster 
populations in the short‐term and those designed to increase long‐
term adaptive capacity (Derry et al., 2019). Genetic rescue is often 
included in the former category; however, this study shows that ge‐
netic rescue may also improve individual's long‐term capacity to re‐
spond to novel environmental stress. We would emphasize that the 
ability of individuals to endure chronic or novel stress is a component 
of fitness, but that the relationship between stress responses and 
overall fitness likely depends on a number of other factors, including 
the realized reproductive success of individuals exposed to stress, 
potential trade‐offs between the ability to respond to stress and 
other fitness components, and the frequency of exposure to stress. 
As demonstration of positive fitness outcomes of restored gene flow 
accumulates (Hasselgren et al., 2018; Hogg, Forbes, Steele, & Luikart, 
2006; Hufbauer et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2010; Kronenberger et 
al., 2018; Madsen, Shine, Olsson, & Wittzell, 1999; Robinson et al., 
2017) and calls for gene flow manipulation grow louder (Ralls et al., 
2018; Whiteley et al., 2015), it will also be critical to understand the 
extent and mechanisms by which new gene flow affects immediate 
and long‐term response to environmental stress. In some cases of 
abrupt stress, such as high‐temperature exposure in our study, gene 
flow may increase initial tolerance and reduce extinction probabil‐
ity. Other scenarios, such as metal pollution in our study, may be 
less generalizable. The genomic architecture underlying maladaptive 
and adaptive stress responses and eventual adaptive evolution to a 
range of environmental stressors is likely to be identified over the 
next few years. Combined with demographic analyses in experimen‐
tal and natural populations, these studies will provide new insights 
and better mechanistic understanding into interactions between
