Meradimate is a broad-spectrum ultraviolet absorber used as a chemical ﬁlter in commercial
sunscreens. Herein, we explore the ultrafast photodynamics occurring in methyl anthranilate
(precursor to Meradimate) immediately after photoexcitation with ultraviolet radiation to
understand the mechanisms underpinning Meradimate photoprotection. Using time-resolved
photoelectron spectroscopy, signal from the ﬁrst singlet excited state of methyl anthranilate
shows an oscillatory behavior, i.e., quantum beats. Our studies reveal a dependence of the
observed beating frequencies on photoexcitation wavelength and photoelectron kinetic
energy, unveiling the different Franck-Condon overlaps between the vibrational levels of the
ground electronic, ﬁrst electronic excited, and ground cationic states of methyl anthranilate.
By evaluating the behavior of these beats with increasing photon energy, we ﬁnd evidence for
intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution on the ﬁrst electronic excited state. Such
energy redistribution hinders efﬁcient relaxation of the electronic excited state, making
methyl anthranilate a poor choice for an efﬁcient, efﬁcacious sunscreen chemical ﬁlter.

ltraviolet (UV) radiation is vital for sustaining life, facil-
itating photosynthesis in plants1 and production of vita-
min D in humans2, for example. Nevertheless, UV
radiation can also have damaging effects3,4, such as highly
mutagenic DNA photolesions which may lead to skin cancer5.
Human skin is naturally protected against radiative stress by
melanin—dark pigments which absorb UV radiation before it
reaches the DNA in skin cells6. However, the photoprotection
afforded by melanin is often insufﬁcient and sunburn may occur
when skin is exposed to UV radiation7. Artiﬁcial skin protection
against UV radiation is currently provided by commercially
available sunscreen lotions, resulting in a recent interest in the
UV initiated photodynamics of sunscreen molecules (see refer-
ences8–10 and references therein). Following photoexcitation, an
ideal sunscreen molecule will rapidly (on a sub-ns timescale)
undergo internal conversion to the ground electronic state, where
the excess energy (now localized in the molecular vibrations) may
be dissipated as heat.
In a previous study, we have reported the photodynamics of
methyl 2-aminobenzoate (methyl anthranilate, MA), the pre-
cursor to the US FDA approved sunscreen component Mer-
adimate
(menthyl
anthranilate,
MenA)11.
In
that
work,
irradiating MA in the 330–300 nm range was found to access the
ﬁrst singlet excited state (S1) resulting in hydrogen dislocation
along the intramolecular N–H  O hydrogen bond. Evidence for
one conical intersection (CI) accessible from the S1 state of MA
was found, though the CI was located beyond a barrier composed
of a H-atom migration and subsequent internal rotation around
the tautomer C–C double bond, as shown schematically in Fig. 1.
Thus, the barrier to the CI effectively “trapped” population
(hindered the non-radiative decay) on the S1 state for ≫ns11.
While photoexcitation above the barrier increased the excited
state decay rate, the overall decay lifetime remained longer than
the 1.2 ns experimental window11. At pump photon energies
greater than the excited state barrier, substitution of the amine
hydrogens with deuterium revealed a measurable kinetic isotope
effect, suggesting that migration of the N–H  O hydrogen was
the “rate determining step” in the overall decay dynamics.
Though no direct evidence for any energy redistribution on the
excited state was found, excited state intramolecular vibrational
energy redistribution (IVR) presumably hinders efﬁcient coupling
to the overall reaction coordinate shown in Fig. 1. To better
understand the mechanisms behind the trapping of S1 excited
state population, we have studied the energy redistribution pro-
cesses occurring in the ﬁrst few picoseconds after photoexcitation
of MA using time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (TR-PES)
12,13. Through electron kinetic energy (eKE) and angular dis-
tributions, TR-PES carries information on both electronic con-
ﬁguration and vibrational dynamics and is thus a powerful tool
for mapping energy ﬂow in polyatomic molecules13,14.
A typical TR-PES experiment will follow a pump-probe
approach. First, the molecule of interest is photoexcited by a
spectrally broad pump laser pulse (λpu), preparing a coherent
superposition of n eigenstates usually termed a wavepacket. The
wavepacket then evolves freely in time according to:12,15


ð1Þ
with ~an accounting for both amplitudes (i.e. populations) and
initial phases of the molecular eigenstates jψni with energy En
(presented here in wavenumber units). After some time delay
(Δt), the probe laser pulse (λpr) projects the wavepacket onto a
ﬁnal state—in the case of TR-PES, a cationic state—generating a
measurable photoelectron signal. Interference between the tran-
sitions from the different wavepacket eigenstates, n and m, onto
the same ﬁnal state causes an oscillating modulation in the time-
dependent photoelectron signal at frequencies ω ¼ ðEn  EmÞ=h,
a phenomenon commonly referred to as quantum beats. Mole-
cular quantum beat spectroscopy thus provides detailed infor-
mation regarding intramolecular state couplings, as well as the
dynamics of energy redistribution in polyatomic molecules16–20.
In the present work, the observation of quantum beats in the
TR-PES of MA is explored to probe the energy redistribution
mechanisms immediately following the absorption of UV radia-
tion. We aim to further elucidate the mechanism by which excited
state population is trapped on the S1 state. In addition, we brieﬂy
present quantum beat results from MenA in order to evaluate the
effects of the additional menthyl group. Ultimately, excited state
IVR appears to hinder efﬁcient sampling of the S1/S0 CI, thus
decreasing the non-radiative S1→S0 relaxation rate of MA and
reducing its efﬁciency and desirability as a photoprotection agent.
Results
Laser induced ﬂuorescence and calculations. The LIF spectrum,
shown in Fig. 2a, is in good agreement with a previous mea-
surement21. The vibrational progressions observed in the LIF
spectra of both MA and its carboxylic acid variant anthranilic
acid (AA) are also similar;22 in MA, at least two prominent
vibrational progressions are observed at 179 cm−1 and 421 cm−1.
As shown in Fig. 2b, the 179 cm−1 vibrational mode (henceforth
referred to as ν179) corresponds to an in-plane bend of the ester
group, while the 421 cm−1 vibrational mode (ν421) corresponds to
a bending motion of the carbonyl and amino groups with some
distortion of the phenyl ring; similar motions were assigned to the
LIF active modes in AA22. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 1,
both modes show displacement upon photoexcitation, explaining
the observed LIF progression. Several satellite features are present
in the spectrum near each fundamental mode; an enlarged
spectrum is shown in Supplementary Fig. 2. These features, not
reproduced by electronic structure calculations (see Supplemen-
tary Table 1), are likely combination bands and/or Fermi reso-
nances (see, for example, reference 23).

Having established the vibrational modes that are active in the
close-to-origin photoexcitation of MA, it is important to specify
which levels of these modes are accessed by the large bandwidth
(~500 cm−1 full width at half maximum) laser pulses used in our
time-resolved experiments. As shown in Fig. 2a, at λpu = 351 nm
the laser pulse accesses mainly the S1 (v = 0) level of MA while
λpu= 348 nm also accesses the v = 1 and 2 levels of ν179. At λpu=
344 nm, a much more complex combination of vibrational levels
spanning over both progressions is accessed. Finally, at λpu = 330
nm, a highly vibrationally excited mixture of states is accessed
(~1400 cm−1 above the origin and near 300 vibrational states/
cm−1; see Supplementary Fig. 3).
Time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. The TR-PES tran-
sients of MA are obtained by integrating an eKE region of interest
(typically between ~150–2500 cm−1) as a function of time delay;
examples of the resulting 1-D intensity vs. time delay transients
are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. The 1-D transient at λpu = 348 nm, for
example, reveals signal oscillations and provides clear evidence
for quantum beats in MA. The transients were analyzed with a
fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm, as described in refer-
ence20, to reveal the frequencies of the quantum beats (shown as
insets in Fig. 2d, e). Transients were also ﬁt using kinetic models
that include a sum of sine waves, the frequencies of which were
compared to the FFT results to ensure agreement; an example of
such ﬁt at λpu = 348 nm is shown in Fig. 2e and ﬁt parameters are
given in Supplementary Table 2. Similar analyses were performed
on the full, 2-D TR-PES transients as a function of eKE for all
time delays, yielding 2-D FFT vs. eKE spectra and highlighting
the eKE at which a beat frequency appears— henceforth referred
to as FFT(eKE). The evolution of the beat frequencies as a
function of time delay was studied by producing FFT spectra for a
given eKE range as a function of time delay, yielding FFT(Δt)
spectra similar to reference24. Further discussion of all data
processing
and
ﬁtting
procedures
may
be
found
in
the Supplementary Methods. Example transients at different ﬁt-
ting stages are shown in Supplementary Fig. 9; a schematic
representation of the production of FFT(eKE) and FFT(Δt)
spectra is also given in Supplementary Fig. 10.
351 and 348 nm photoexcitation. As expected from the spectra
in Fig. 2, the observed quantum beat frequencies are pump
wavelength dependent. At the lowest energy photoexcitation,
λpu = 351 nm, no oscillations are observed in the transient (see
Fig. 2d), suggesting that this pump energy is only populating the
ground vibrational state of S1. The near-negligible feature at ~180
cm−1 in the FFT spectrum is likely due to the edge of the 351 nm
pulse exciting the v = 1 level of ν179, as shown in Fig. 2a. At λpu =
348 nm, a prominent beat frequency of ~180 cm−1 is extracted
from both the FFT spectrum and sine wave ﬁt to the TR-PES
transient, consistent with the excitation of the v = 0, 1, and 2
levels of ν179 shown in Fig. 1e. An additional frequency of ca. 5
cm−1 (see Supplementary Table 2) is also present due to the short
wavelength edge of the pump laser spectrum interacting with
higher lying vibrational states. The oscillations at 348 nm show
little evidence of dampening or decay by 5 ps, supporting the
expectation that population in the low-lying levels of ν179 persists
for much longer than the duration of these experiments;25 FFT
(eKE) and FFT(Δt) spectra are shown in Supplementary Fig. 4.
330 nm photoexcitation. At λpu = 330 nm, the longest wave-
length used in our previous investigation11, the FFT(eKE) spec-
trum in Fig. 3 shows features around 60, 115, and 180 cm−1. As
before, the 180 cm−1 beat frequency may be assigned to inter-
ference between levels of ν179. While the present LIF spectrum
does not extend to 330 nm, 60 and 115 cm−1 energy spacings
arise from multiple combinations of vibrationally excited ν179 and
ν421, thus suggesting that the 60 and 115 cm−1 beats arise from
combination bands involving these two modes. The observed
beats are dependent on eKE: the 180 cm−1 beat appears closer to

each photoelectron intensity maximum while the high eKE edges
of each photoelectron feature reveal evidence of interference with
ν421. The 180 cm−1 beat frequency also shows a ~π/2 phase shift
relative to the other beat (see Supplementary Table 2). An addi-
tional beat frequency of ≤25 cm−1 is also observed at λpu= 30
nm, however this beat is likely from interferences between
vibrational modes not captured in the LIF spectrum. Indeed,
excited state frequency calculations reveal ﬁve modes between
1400 and 1500 cm−1 (near the center of the 330 nm pump
spectrum), generally described as in-plane ring distortions.
The quantum beats observed at λpu = 330 nm have a
signiﬁcantly shorter decay lifetime than at λpu = 348 nm; a
timescale of 2–3 ps may be estimated from the FFT(Δt) results in
Fig. 3e. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 5, measurements
extending to Δt = 12.5 ps show no evidence for quantum beat
revival. The shorter decay times at λpu = 330 nm allow for the 1-
D transient to be ﬁt with a kinetic model (see Fig. 2a) yielding an
overall beat decay lifetime of 1.4 ± 0.2 ps; the reported error is the
standard error from the ﬁt. Thus, FFT(Δt) intensity changes
appear to be representative of beat dampening—this assumption
will be made throughout the ensuing discussion.
A one-dimensional transient at λpu = 330 nm was also
obtained for MenA; the results are also shown in Fig. 3b. Upon
replacing the methyl group with the larger menthyl group both
the beat pattern and dampening time in MenA are altered with
the ﬁt returning a slightly shorter dampening lifetime of 1.0 ±
0.3 ps.
344 nm photoexcitation. The beat behavior of MA at λpu =
344 nm was also investigated; an example isolated transient (i.e.
after normalizing to the overall decay, as discussed in the Sup-
plementary Methods) is shown in Fig. 4a. Despite the different
vibrational modes excited by this pump wavelength (see Fig. 2a),
the FFT(eKE) spectra at this wavelength reveal similar quantum
beat frequencies to both the 348 and 330 nm results; see Sup-
plementary Fig. 6. At λpu = 344 nm, the 60 and 115 cm−1 beat
frequencies may be ﬁrmly assigned to interference between the v
= 1 level of ν421 with the v = 2 and 3 levels of ν179 (a combination
not directly excited by the 330 nm pump laser). As can be seen in
Supplementary Fig. 6, the beat previously observed at 60 cm−1
now comprises two distinct features at 62 and 56 cm−1 due to an
additional interference term between the v = 1 level of ν421 and
the prominent LIF peak at 366 cm−1 (see Supplementary Fig. 2).
As was the case at λpu = 330 nm, the beats at λpu =44 nm still
show a clear eKE dependence with vibrational excitation retained
in the ν179 mode upon ionization (shown in Supplementary
Fig. 6) and a relative phase of approximately π/2 for the 180 cm−1
beat. Indeed, as shown in the two-dimensional transient in
Supplementary Fig. 7, each beat shows a clear temporal offset
with decreasing eKE.
Two λpu = 344 nm transients were acquired over two successive
and overlapping time windows; the resulting FFT(Δt) spectra are
shown in Fig. 4b, c. Both the transient and FFT(Δt) spectra reveal
a much richer temporal behavior than at the other wavelengths
studied. First, the quantum beats near 60 and 115 cm−1 appear to
dampen within the ﬁrst two picoseconds. The 60 cm−1 beats,
however, show a revival at ~5 ps. This revival is more apparent in
Fig. 4c, where the 60 cm−1 FFT intensity is larger relative to the
other intensities (due to the intensity scaling of the FFT analysis).
The 180 and 115 cm−1 beats appear to show revivals at 7 and 9.5
ps, respectively.
Wavepacket calculations. To aid the interpretation of these
transients, the time-autocorrelation function of Eq. (1) was cal-
culated15 using the dominant transitions observed in the LIF
spectrum; see Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Table
4 for further details. Essentially, the time-autocorrelation function
describes the temporal behavior of the wavepacket as it moves out
of and back into the Franck-Condon region. Plots of the survival

The
calculated
behavior
shows
remarkably good agreement with the experimental beats, repro-
ducing the overall time behavior of the isolated 1-D transient and
FFT spectra, excepting a spurious revival of the 60 cm−1 beat at
~9.5 ps. To achieve good agreement with the experimental tran-
sient at 344 nm, a vibrational mode dependent phase of π/2 was
added to the LIF peaks associated with ν179 (see Supplementary
Table 3).
Discussion
The agreement between the dominant LIF active modes and the
extracted beat frequencies is compelling evidence for the assign-
ment of the observed beats to the ν179 and ν421 modes with
contributions from nearby bands. Interestingly, this agreement
also suggests that the observed beats are due solely to “bright”
(S1 ←S0 active) states. The beat frequency dependence upon eKE
reveals that vibrational excitation of the S1 state is preserved in
ν179 upon ionization and conﬁrms that the 180 cm−1 beat fre-
quency is largely due to interference between multiple excited
levels of ν179. Beats involving the v = 1 level of ν421, however, only
appear at the highest eKE as the v = 0 level of the Dþ
0 state is the
common ﬁnal state onto which all vibrational modes may project.
The absence of beat frequencies larger than ~250 cm−1 is due to
the temporal resolution of our experiment (see Supplementary
Fig. 11 in the Supplementary Methods). Further discussion of the
photoelectron structure and eKE dependence of the quantum
beats may be found in Supplementary Discussion 1.
With vibrational assignments to the dominant quantum beats,
we now focus on the pump wavelength dependent decay times of
these beats. For large polyatomic molecules, the disappearance of
quantum beats is due to depopulation of the initially prepared
vibrational states via intramolecular vibrational energy redis-
tribution (IVR)28–30. At λpu = 348 nm, where only the lowest
vibrational levels of MA are populated, the 180 cm−1 beat is a
signature feature of a coherent superposition of the v = 1 and v =
0 levels of ν179. As there is no “bath” of modes at this excitation
energy, see Supplementary Fig. 3, IVR does not occur and
population remains localized in these modes for the duration of
the experiment. Conversely, at λpu = 330 nm a rapid dampening
of the beats is observed as the much higher density of states
facilitates rapid, “statistical” IVR (provided efﬁcient coupling
between states is maintained)25.
In our previous time-resolved study, we found the excited state
population of MA to be trapped in the S1 state, incapable of
overcoming a ~0.4 eV barrier to a S1/S0 CI via a twisting motion
of the ester group11. Our present results at λpu = 330 nm suggest
that the long excited state lifetime observed at shorter wave-
lengths (i.e. above the excited state barrier) is likely due to IVR
following photoexcitation; low-lying “vibration-torsion” doorway
states19,25,30,31 could facilitate the coupling of the initially excited
vibrational modes to a non-reactive bath of modes32,33. Indeed,
even at relatively low vibrational state densities, molecules with
methyl
rotors
can
show
complex
vibrational
state
interactions32–34. Such excited state energy randomization would
thus result in a “statistical-like,” i.e. nanosecond, depopulation of
the MA S1 state (as was previously observed11) via ﬂuorescence
and/or the S1/S0 CI. As seen in Fig. 3b, the addition of the
menthyl group (and the resulting increased density of states) in
MenA appears to decrease the IVR lifetime, explaining the qua-
litatively slower decay of the S1 state of this sunscreen agent
observed in our previous work11.
At the photon energies needed to overcome the excited state
barrier in MA, IVR on the electronic excited state is unsurprising.
Similarly at λpu = 344 nm, ~200 cm−1 above the S1 origin and at
approximately 0.2 vibrational states/cm−1 (see Supplementary
Fig. 3), we do not expect to see any IVR-like behavior25. Indeed,
the quantum beats at this wavelength show clear evidence for
dephasing and revival with the time-autocorrelation calculation
in qualitatively good agreement with the revival times of each
frequency. The most signiﬁcant disagreement, an extra revival of
the 60 cm−1 beat, is likely due to inaccuracies in the phase factor
added to each vibrational level in the calculation. As discussed
further in Supplementary Discussion 2, the inclusion of a phase
factor

reproduction of the experimental transients and observed quan-
tum beat phase (see Supplementary Table 2).
The origin of this phase factor and the experimentally observed
quantum beat phase may be understood by considering the
appearance of the 180 cm−1 beat at lower eKE. While the energy
shift is related to the projection of ν179 into the vibrationally
excited cation (as discussed above), the diagonal beat recurrences
shown in Supplementary Fig. 7 show that quantum beats
appearing at lower eKE also appear to be shifted in time delay.
Such a temporal offset may be described as a quantum beat
(namely the 180 cm−1 beat) with a different phase15. As this
phase is tied to a change in eKE, the phase factors added to the
time-autocorrelation function must serve to independently shift
the time-autocorrelation “probe window” along each vibrational
coordinate involved in a given beat. Furthermore, the inclusion of
a phase factor into these wavepacket calculations that depends on
speciﬁc vibrational modes implies that a majority of the modes
contributing to the 180 cm−1 beat are observed away from their
respective classical turning points (i.e. the potential energy walls
of each vibrational mode, see reference 35 for example) in the
experiment. While the mixed nature of the S1 vibrational states
(as evidenced by the large number of satellite peaks near the main
LIF progressions) makes ﬁrm assignment of each vibrational
phase untenable at present, we may yet unveil some information
about the S1 state. A reasonable wavepacket reproduction of the
experimental transient is obtained when the levels of ν179 are
given a phase factor of π/2 relative to the other vibrational modes
(as shown in Fig. 4d). This ν179 phase factor is different from
applying a phase of π/2 to any ~180 cm−1 beat, as several other
combinations of LIF peaks also contribute to this beat (most
signiﬁcantly the LIF peak at 366 cm−1 and the cluster of peaks
near 600 cm−1 shown in Supplementary Fig. 2). Indeed, as shown
in Supplementary Fig. 8, wavepacket calculations with a phase
factor of π/2 added to these modes result in substantially poorer
agreement to the experimental 344 nm transient. It thus appears
that the ionization window along the ν179 coordinate is shifted
relative to the other normal modes.
Regardless of the nature of the observed quantum beat phase,
the time-autocorrelation function is too simplistic to accurately
model the MA beat behavior: this function does not contain any
information about the S1 potential energy landscape or an explicit
projection onto the Dþ
0 surface, factors which must play a sig-
niﬁcant role in the experimentally observed temporal behavior of
these beats. A more accurate representation of photoexcitation
and time-dependent photoionization of MA (such as through
direct dynamics calculations) may reproduce the observed beat
behavior36,37 and would be of signiﬁcant interest. Thus, there is a
clear need for additional theoretical and experimental work (both
time-resolved vibrational and frequency-resolved vibronic spec-
troscopies) to elucidate the nature of the observed wavepacket
behavior and further our understanding of vibrational energy
ﬂow in MA.
In summary, the study reported herein has provided insight
into the vibrational energy redistribution processes occurring in
MA (a sunscreen precursor) immediately after photoexcitation
with UV radiation. The LIF and quantum beats provide insight
into the Franck-Condon activity of the S1 ←S0 transition, as well
as the relative geometries of the S1 and Dþ
0 states. Our results have
unveiled the ultrafast IVR processes in MA at λpu = 330 nm
which allow for prompt redistribution of population on the S1
state, further elucidating the trapping mechanism of excited state
population of MA at shorter wavelengths. We also present evi-
dence for a vibrational mode dependent phase not easily repro-
duced by a time-autocorrelation model, suggesting that further
exploration is necessary to understand time-dependent ionization
in the analysis of molecular quantum beats.
By understanding the fate of energy absorbed by an isolated
sunscreen precursor we can reveal the key mechanisms that
afford – or hinder – effective photoprotection to sunscreen active
ingredients. In the case of MA, while the intramolecular hydrogen
bond affords the molecule photostability (maintaining molecular
integrity following photoexcitation), the same moiety also stabi-
lizes the excited state and hinders rapid, non-radiative decay11. As
H-atom migration, a key step towards the S1/S0 CI in MA11, does
not appear to be an active mode with UV-A photoexcitation
(400–315 nm), the bath of modes available to MA and MenA
instead hinders efﬁcient, rapid excited state evolution towards the
CI and thus impedes ideal photoprotection. As such, this work
supports our previous conclusion that MA and MenA are a poor
choice for an efﬁcient sunscreen chemical absorber.
The results presented herein highlight an important con-
sideration for rational sunscreen design: ensuring that the
Franck-Condon active vibrational modes are involved in the
rapid return to the ground electronic state, completing the
absorption-recovery cycle of photoprotection prior to signiﬁcant
excited state energy randomization. Furthermore, it is important
to extend these studies towards a “commercial” sunscreen sce-
nario whereby the sunscreen molecule is made to interact with
solvents and other sunscreen ingredients (such as reference 38).
Evaluating interactions in a complex environment, where energy
transfer processes may dominate excited state relaxation, is
essential
to
understanding
the
global
mechanisms
of
photoprotection.
Methods
Laser induced ﬂuorescence. The laser induced ﬂuorescence (LIF) apparatus is
described in detail elsewhere39. A liquid sample of MA (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) was
placed in an unheated glass sample holder behind an 800 μm diameter nozzle
(Parker General Valve series 9), entrained in ~3 bar He, and pulsed into a vacuum
chamber at 20 Hz, creating a supersonic expansion that cools the molecules into
their vibrational zero-point level prior to interrogation. Approximately 8 mm
downstream from the nozzle, the frequency doubled output of a Nd:YAG-pumped
dye laser (LambdaPhysik Scanmate) interacted with the expansion-cooled mole-
cules in the focal point of two 4-inch diameter spherical mirrors, the bottom mirror
containing a 1 cm hole through which the ﬂuorescent photons were focused. These
spherical mirrors steered the ﬂuorescence photons through a 2-inch diameter
plano-convex collimating lens, a long-pass ﬁlter to reduce scattered light, and onto
a UV-sensitive photomultiplier tube (PMT).
The dye laser frequency was scanned through the 347–335 nm range that
includes the S1 ←S0 origin transition (00
0) while collecting the total ﬂuorescence.
The ﬂuorescence decay proﬁle from the PMT was digitized by an oscilloscope
(Tektronix, model 3052B), sent to a computer, and plotted as a function of
excitation wavelength.
Time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. The TR-PES apparatus used in this
work has been described previously40–42 and consists of a commercially available
femtosecond (fs) laser system, a molecular beam source and a photoelectron
spectrometer43. A Ti:Sapphire oscillator (Spectra-Physics Tsunami) and regen-
erative ampliﬁer (Spectra-Physics Spitﬁre XP) are used to produce ~40 fs laser
pulses centered at 800 nm at ~3 mJ per pulse and 1 kHz. The fundamental 800 nm
output is subsequently split into three 1 W beams. One of these beams is used to
pump an optical parametric ampliﬁer (Light Conversion TOPAS-C) to generate
“pump” (λpu) pulses, with centers varied between 330–351 nm. A second 800 nm
laser beam pumps a separate TOPAS-C which is used to generate “probe” (λpr)
pulses, centered at 285 nm for MA and 296 nm for MenA. Probe wavelengths were
chosen such that the total photon energy is slightly larger than the ionization
energy of each molecule. The pump and probe pulses are temporally delayed with
respect to each other (Δt) by a retroreﬂector mounted on a motorized delay stage,
allowing a maximum temporal delay of 1.2 ns. Laser powers were set to ensure
single photon initiated photochemistry.
The two laser beams intersect a molecular beam which is produced by seeding
MA (Alfa Aesar, 99%) heated to 55 °C or MenA (Aldrich, 98%) heated to 90 °C
into helium (~3 bar). This gas mixture is then expanded into vacuum using an
Even-Lavie pulsed solenoid valve23,24. At Δt > 0, λpu excites molecules entrained in
the beam and λpr ionizes the excited species. The resulting photoelectrons are
focused onto a position-sensitive microchannel plate (MCP) detector coupled to a
phosphor screen such that electrons with the same initial velocity are mapped onto
the same point on the detector43. The original photoelectron distribution is
reconstructed from the measured two-dimensional (2-D) projection using a polar
onion peeling algorithm44 from which the desired one-dimensional (1-D)

photoelectron spectrum was derived. The spectrometer is calibrated using the well-
known photoelectron spectrum of photoionized Xe45.
Computational methods. All calculations were performed using the GAMESS
computational package46,47. The geometry of MA was optimized on both the S0, S1,
and Dþ
0 surfaces at the (TD-)CAM-B3LYP48/cc-pVDZ49 level of theory50–52.
Harmonic frequencies were calculated at the S0 equilibrium (S0,eq), S1 vertical
Franck-Condon (S1,vFC), S1 equilibrium (S1,eq), Dþ
0 vertical Franck-Condon (Dþ
0 ,
vFC), and Dþ
0 equilibrium (Dþ
0 ,eq) geometries. The vibrational density of states was
calculated from the S1,eq frequencies using the direct counting method of Beyer and
Swinehart53.
The Franck-Condon active vibrational modes were identiﬁed from the LIF
results. Potential energy cuts (PECs) along these normal modes were generated by a
Cartesian coordinate offset from a starting geometry (e.g., S0,eq) using the
wxMacMolPlt program54. Single-point energies were then calculated at each set of
offset coordinates and ﬁt with a harmonic potential.
Wavepacket calculations. Detailed descriptions of the wavepacket calculations
may be found in the Supplementary Methods. Brieﬂy, the absolute square of the
time-autocorrelation of Eq. (1), i.e. hΨðΔtÞjΨð0Þi
j
j2, was numerically evaluated by
a MATLAB program. The results were then temporally smoothed to account for
the pump and probe laser temporal widths, yielding one-dimensional calculated
“transients.” The wavepacket calculation code is freely available in the Zenodo data
repository, as described below. The one-dimensional, calculated “transients” were
subjected to the same FFT(Δt) analysis as the isolated experimental transients as
described in the Supplementary Methods.
Data availability
The TR-PES, LIF, computational data, and wavepacket propagation program
underpinning the present research are freely available in the Zenodo data reposi-
tory with the identiﬁer doi:10.5281/zenodo.1472500; descriptions of the data for-
mats and further details are given in Supplementary Note 1.
