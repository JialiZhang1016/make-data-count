Abstract: The skin of three juvenile Lepidosiren paradoxa specimens was examined. The epidermis was 
composed of a polystratified epithelium resting on a basement membrane, including mucus-secreting cells, 
and a cuticle of mucopolysaccharides on the surface. Two types of skin receptors, electroreceptors and 
mechanoreceptors, were found; the first type was located in the dermoepidermal junction, and the second 
type was completely intraepiderma. The skin structure of these fish, suggests the possibility of the skin 
participating in the breath.
Key words: electroreceptors, lungfish, mechanoreceptors, Paraná River basin, pirambóia.

INTRODUCTION
The South American Lungfish (Lepidosiren 
paradoxa) is found in the marshes and slow waters 
of the Amazon, Paraguay Basin and Paraná River 
in South America (Vallone 2017). As a remarkable 
obligate air breather, he is also the only recent 
member of the family, Lepidosirenidae (Froese 
and Pauly 2014).
Juvenile lungfish feed on the larvae of insects 
and snails, while the adults are omnivores, adding 
algae and shrimp to their diets and crushing them 
with their highly mineralized dental plates. The 
usual habitats of the fish disappear during the dry 
season; during this time, they hide in the mud and 
make a chamber approximately 30-50 cm beneath 
the mud surface, leaving some holes to the surface 
for air to enter. The skin has important functions 
during this aestivation, and a layer of mucus is 
produced to seal in moisture and slow down its 
metabolism as well as to participate in respiration 
(Bruton 1998).
The objective of this work is to describe 
the skin of L. paradoxa juveniles, as well as to 
demonstrate characteristics of adaptation of the 
species to the environment with the presence of 
electro and mechanoreceptors, which are necessary 
for their survival.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Three L. paradoxa juveniles were captured by 
fishermen in a sector with mud and scarce water 
where they were buried in Esteros del Ibera in the 
province of Corrientes, Argentina. The lengths

of the specimens were 110, 107 and 125 mm. 
The specimens were anaesthetized with 0.5% 
benzocaine (Sigma-Aldrich) for approximately 
30 minutes according to De Moraes et al. (2005). 
Transverse skin sections were obtained from the 
dorsal and dorsocephalic region, dorsolateral and 
abdominal region, fixed in 10% formalin, and 
embedded in Paraplast. The histological sections 
were stained with haematoxylin and eosin, 
periodic acid Schiff (PAS), Kuhn blue and Cajal 
gold sublimate modified for sections embedded 
in Paraplast and identified histological structures 
according to Mokhtar (2017) (Naoumenko and 
Feigin 1961).
RESULTS
In the histological sections, we observed the classic 
layers that form the skin of fish: the epidermis, the 
stratum spongiosum and stratum compactum of 
the dermis, the hypodermis and the subcutaneous 
muscle (Figure 1).
The epidermis was composed of a polystratified 
epithelium of between 4 and 5 layers of cells, and 
the entire epidermis rested on a basement membrane 
(BM) (Figure 2).
The epidermis was composed of several cell 
types. The basal cells are totipotent cells that 
generate all other cells, and these cells can become 
irregular. Mucus-secreting cells were present in 
the Malpighian stratum. As juvenile animals were 
observed, mucus-secreting cells showed high 
cellular activity; these cells were hyperchromatic 
with several mitotic cells (Figure 3). On the surface, 
a PAS-positive cuticle was observed, possibly 
composed of mucopolysaccharides (Figure 4). The 
epidermis rested on a BM that separated it from the 
stratum spongiosum of the dermis in which there 
was abundant melanin belonging to melanophores. 
Melanin was also observed scattered throughout 
the thickness of the epidermis. Melanophores 
stained with Cajal gold sublimate showed

irregular prolongations (Figure 5). In the stratum 
compactum of the dermis, we observed abundant 
collagen and elastic fibres and vascular structures. 
The hypodermis was very thin, with a few isolated 
vascular capillaries
Mechanoreceptors were located in the 
epidermis, and electroreceptors were observed 
within the dermis near the epidermis. The 
mechanoreceptors comprised a group of columnar 
cells derived from the epithelium, with a central 
neuroepithelial cell from which stereocilia exited 
to the surface; modified columnar epithelial cells 
surrounded and supported the mass of the sensory 
cells (Figure 6).
Electroreceptors were present in the epidermis 
and superficial areas of the dermis and consisted of a 
double layer of cuboidal cells forming a hollow bulb 
located below the collagen of the dermoepidermal 
junction (Figure 7). The cells lining the bulb had

tiny projections from the surface, and some of the 
cells showed evidence of cell division, which was 
uncommon elsewhere in the epidermal and dermal 
tissues. A narrow duct, lined by a single layer 
of epithelial cells, extended from the base to the 
surface of the epithelium where it opened like a

DISCUSSION
The structure of the skin of L. paradoxa and other 
lungfish has been described by several authors 
(Coelho and Sawaya 1972, Imaki and Chavin 
1975a, b). The importance of skin structure in the 
physiology of these fish is significant; the skin of 
all teleosts is the primary protective barrier against 
external pathogens, and mucus production plays an

important role in the non-specific immune response 
(Heimroth et al. 2018, Xu et al. 2013). Moreover, 
since L. paradoxa is a lungfish, the mechanisms 
and tissues involved in the respiratory process are 
diverse, and the skin plays a very important role; 
in this sense, lungfish skin is similar to that of 
amphibians (Hughes 1976).
The skin of the snout and lips in the living 
Neoceratodus forsteri is soft, and free of scales at 
all stages of the life cycle. In external view, the skin 
of the snout is pitted, with perforations of various 
sizes, for goblet cells and sense organs, and apart

contain capillaries; instead, it is nourished by the 
blood capillaries of subepithelial connective tissue, 
in this case, the dermis (Gartner 2017).
PAS-positive mucus-secreting cells were 
predominantly found in the epidermis. These cells 
were loaded with mucus, which they released at 
the surface, generating a mucosal surface over the 
entire body of the fish. Although the mucus should 
help with swimming, it may be more helpful when 
the animals exit the caves that they make in the 
mud; when the mud dries, the mucus provides 
lubrication to allow mobility. In addition, mucus 
is rich in lysozyme that acts as a broad spectrum 
bactericide (Romano 2010).
The mechanoreceptors are part of the acoustic-
lateral system. These receptors collect mechanical 
signals in the water and have both afferent and

from this, individual epithelial cells are visible in 
surface view (Kemp 2012). 
The epidermis in these juvenile animals 
showed intense cellular activity, such that almost 
all of their cells had hyperchromatic nuclei with 
abundant mitosis. Such cellular activity has not 
been previously reported, even in studies on the 
juvenile skin of both L. paradoxa and Neoceratodus 
forsteri (Imaki and Chavin 1975a, b). This high 
cellular activity is expected in all vertebrates since 
the epidermis belongs to the class of labile tissues 
with a high rate of cell renewal. In addition, in 
the case of juvenile animals, the average life span 
of cells is shorter (Gartner 2017). Johansen and 
Lenfant (1967) have observed blood capillaries 
in the epidermis, while we observed capillaries in 
the dermis only. The epithelium structure does not

South American lungfish. In the present study, 
the structure of the skin of these fish, together 
with the identification of electroreceptors and 
mechanoreceptors, was elucidated. 
According to Zena et al. (2017), the skin of 
Lepidosiren paradoxa actively exchanges CO2 
through the skin. Therefore, studying the structure 
of this organ that seems important in the appearance 
of terrestrial respiration is essential.

efferent innervation. The electroreceptors are 
small, confined to the superficial layers of the 
dermis or epidermis, and exhibit single innervation 
(Northcutt 1986). These receptors are sensitive 
to weak electrical currents in the water possibly 
emitted by prey animals (Roth 1973, Roth and 
Tscharntke 1976, Bullock et al. 1983, Kramer 
1996, Collin and Whitehead 2004).
The skin is recognized as a secondary 
respiratory tissue in several species (Urbina and 
Meredith 2014), and in lungfish, epidermal mucus 
is directly related to respiratory physiology 
(Heimroth et al. 2018).
