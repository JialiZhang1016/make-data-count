ABSTRACT. The remediation of lead-contaminated areas poses a serious challenge to soil chemists 
because Pb has low solubility in soil. Thus, Pb phytostabilization is considered to be an attractive 
remediation technique. Castor bean (Ricinus communis) is an oilseed crop known for its tolerance to heavy 
metals, and our aim was to assess the early detection of Pb toxicity and the effects of Pb on the biomass, 
photosynthetic pigments, antioxidative enzyme activities, and total soluble proteins of this plant. Specimens 
were grown in a nutrient solution spiked with Pb concentrations of 25, 50, 100, 150, or 200 μmol L-1. A 
control without Pb was also grown. The results show that X-ray chlorophyll fluorescence is an efficient 
technique for the early detection of photosystem II alterations driven by Pb toxicity. Castor bean was 
tolerant to the Pb doses tested; plants presented no changes in photosynthetic pigments, defense enzyme 
activities, or total soluble proteins in leaves. Given its ability to tolerate and accumulate Pb in its roots, 
castor bean is a viable alternative for phytostabilization and phytoattenuation of lead-contaminated areas. It 
is also economically attractive for industrial and biofuel oil production while being used for remediation.

Alterações metabólicas e fluorescência de clorofila para detecção precoce da toxicidade de 
chumbo em mamona (Ricinus communis) 
RESUMO. A remediação de áreas contaminadas com Pb é uma prática relevante e difícil, pois este é um 
elemento praticamente imóvel no solo. A fitoestabilização é uma prática considerada ambientalmente 
atraente para manejo de áreas contaminadas por metais pesados. A mamona é uma espécie produtora de 
óleo não comestível e apresenta relativa tolerância a metais pesados. O presente trabalho avaliou a 
toxicidade por Pb utilizando a técnica da fluorescência de clorofila e as alterações provocadas pelo metal na 
produção de biomassa, produção de pigmentos fotossintéticos, na atividade de enzimas antioxidantes e 
concentração de proteínas solúveis total. Os resultados demonstraram que a fluorescência de clorofila é um 
indicador eficiente para detectar precocemente as alterações no fotossistema II causadas pela toxicidade por 
Pb. As doses de Pb não provocaram alterações nos pigmentos fotossintéticos, na atividade das enzimas 
antioxidantes e nas proteínas solúveis total nas folhas. A mamona, por sua tolerância e capacidade de 
acumular Pb nas raízes, pode ser uma alternativa ambiental e economicamente atraente para 
fitoestabilização e fitoatenuação de áreas contaminadas por Pb. A mamona apresenta adicional vantagem 
econômica decorrente da utilização do óleo para produção de bioenergia e fins industriais durante o 
processo de remediação.

Introduction 
Environmental contamination by lead (Pb) could 
originate from anthropogenic sources such as 
sewage sludge, mining, metallurgy, or waste and 
pollutant 
emissions 
from 
various 
industrial 
activities. Once Pb enters the soil system, it can be 
transferred to various trophic levels, compromising 
environmental quality (Ren, Wang, & Zhang, 2006; 
Gamiño-Gutiérrez, González-Pérez, Gonsebatt, & 
Monroy-Fernández, 2013; Li, Lin, Cheng, Duan, & 
Lei, 2015; Santos, Nascimento, Matschullat, & 
Olinda, 2016). 
In areas contaminated with Pb, its removal is an 
onerous and difficult task because it is a practically 
immobile element in soil, and it presents low 
translocation in most plants. Phytoremediation 
practices can be used to remediate impacted areas, 
and among these practices, phytostabilization can be

an environmentally attractive alternative. Some 
researchers have demonstrated that castor bean is 
highly tolerant of heavy metals and metalloids 
(Costa et al., 2012; Silva, Silva, Araújo, & 
Nascimento, 2017). Because it is a non-food crop, it 
has great potential for remediation of contaminated 
areas, and it has the additional advantage of 
economic exploitation during the recovery period 
because it can be used for biofuel production 
(Berman, Nizri, & Wiesman, 2011) with no 
restrictions on metal accumulation in the oil 
(González-Chávez, 
Ruız 
Olivares, 
Carrillo-
González, Leal, 2015). 
Lead accumulation and the mechanisms involved 
in its tolerance and toxicity can lead to distinct 
responses in various plant species. Tolerant plants 
can sequester and accumulate Pb in the cell wall 
and/or vacuole, thus restricting its toxicity (Kopittke 
et al., 2008; Meyers, Auchterlonie, Webb, Wood, 
2008; Chandra & Kumar, 2017). In addition, 
antioxidant enzyme activity in plants cultivated 
under Pb stress is reportedly a relevant defense 
mechanism against this element (Kumar, Prasad, & 
Sytar, 
2012; 
Hamdouche, 
Aoumeur, 
Djediai, 
Slimani, & Aoues, 2012). On the other hand, plants 
susceptible to Pb toxicity exhibit visual symptoms 
such as reduced dry matter production (Karimi, 
Khanahmadi, & Moradi, 2012), chlorosis followed 
by necrosis and decreased assimilation of nitrogen 
(Hamdouche et al., 2012; Alkhatib et al., 2011), 
nutritional imbalance (Sinha, Dube, Srivastava, & 
Chatterjee, 2006), slower photosynthetic rate, and 
lower CO2 concentration in leaves. 
Aside from investigations of the toxic effects of 
Pb on plant tissues (visual symptoms; nutritional 
imbalance; and morphological, metabolic, and 
physiological disorders), techniques allowing the 
identification of toxicity or tolerance in early-stage 
plants are of great importance for monitoring 
environmental 
contamination. 
Chlorophyll 
fluorescence 
uses 
information 
about 
the 
photochemical activity of plants, allowing the early 
detection of environmental stress (Corcoll, Bonet, 
Leira, & Guasch 2011, Marques, Nascimento, Silva, 
Gouveia-Neto, & Silva, 2017; Silva, Nascimento, & 
Gouveia-Neto, 2017). This is possible because the 
chlorophyll molecule is fluorescent, and through 
photon dissipation, changes in electron transfer at 
the level of chloroplast membranes can be detected 
(Lin, Liu, Lin, Pan, & Peng, 2007). Another 
significant advantage of this technique is that it is 
sensitive to photosynthetic cell membrane disorders 
but does not destroy plant tissue (Cherif et al., 2010; 
Silva, Nascimento, Gouveia-Neto, & Silva-Jr., 2015; 
Marques & Nascimento, 2013). 
In this study, we evaluated the toxicity of Pb 
using the non-destructive chlorophyll fluorescence 
technique and evaluated changes in the production 
of biomass and photosynthetic pigments, the activity 
of antioxidant enzymes, and the concentration of 
total soluble proteins. We aimed to use this species 
in 
phytostabilization 
or 
phytoattenuation 
remediation programs. 
Material and method 
Castor bean seeds (Ricinus communis cv. BRS 
Energia) were germinated in trays containing 
vermiculite moistened with a 0.67 mmol L-1 Ca 
solution (Ca(NO3)2.4H2O) (Vilela & Anghinoni, 
1984). Twenty-eight days after sowing, the seedlings 
were transferred to plastic pots with 6 L of nutrient 
solution, which was replaced weekly (Hoagland & 
Arnon, 1950), containing: 105.05 mg L-1 N, 15.5 mg 
L-1 P, 117.3 mg L-1 K, 100.2 mg L-1 Ca, 24.3 mg L-1 
Mg, 32.1 mg L-1 S, 0.65 mg L-1 Cl, 0.5 mg L-1 Mn, 
0.05 mg L-1 Zn, 0.02 mg L-1 Cu, 0.5 mg L-1 B, 0.01 
mg L-1 Mo, and 7.35 mg L-1 Fe. Deionized water was 
added 
daily 
to 
replace 
the 
water 
lost 
by 
evapotranspiration. The pH was adjusted with 
H2SO4 or NaOH 1 mmol L-1 to values close to 5.6 
(+/- 0.2) whenever necessary. Doses of 25, 50, 100, 
150, and 200 μmol L-1 Pb [(CH3COO)2Pb3H2O] 
were added to the solution after 14 days of culture. 
The control did not contain added Pb.  
The plants were kept in a greenhouse for 28 
days once Pb was added. The plants were 
collected at the end of the growth period. Leaves, 
stems and roots were separated, dried and 
weighed to obtain their respective biomasses. 
Digestion of powdered plant material was carried 
out in a microwave oven. In the digestion extract, 
Pb concentrations were determined by atomic 
absorption spectrophotometry (Perkin Elmer, 
AAnalyst 800). 
Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements were 
carried out with a UV LED light, with red (685 
ηm) and far-red (735 ηm) peaks obtained by the 
appliance’s software (Ocean Optics SpectraSuite). 
Four evaluations were performed throughout the 
experiment. The first was carried out before metal 
addition, and the last was carried out the day 
before plant collection. These evaluations were 
performed at night, after leaving the plants in the 
dark for 20 min. in order to ensure the 
inactivation 
of 
electron 
transport 
in

photosynthesis. Analyses were carried out using 
the second pair of leaves below the apical 
meristem, with four readings per plant submitted 
to light emission for 10 seconds.  
The spectra were fitted to two Gaussian curves 
corresponding to 685 ηm and 735 ηm. The peak 
height of the fluorescence intensity F685/F735 
ratio (Fr/FFr) was calculated from the fitted curve 
for Pb concentration and used to infer the effect 
of the element on the biosynthesis of chlorophyll 
and PSII via Origin 6.0 software. 
One sample per plant was collected from the 
same pair of leaves used in the evaluation of 
chlorophyll fluorescence for the analyses of 
photosynthetic pigments. The determination of 
chlorophylls a and b as well as carotenoids was 
carried out using extraction with 80% acetone 
(Arnon, 1949). The equation suggested by 
Lichtenthaler (1987) was used for carotenoid 
determination. 
The crude extract used in the determination of 
enzyme activity and protein content was obtained 
by mixing 200 mg of plant material in a mortar 
with liquid N2 and 2.0 mL of potassium 
phosphate buffer (100 mmol L-1, pH 7.0). The 
homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000 g for 25 
min. at 4°C. The supernatant was collected and 
stored in a freezer at 80°C. Ascorbate peroxidase 
(Nakano & Asada, 1981), catalase (Havir & 
McHale, 
1987), 
polyphenoloxidase 
(Kar 
& 
Mishra, 1976), and total soluble protein content 
(Bradford, 1976) activities were determined by 
spectrophotometry.  
The 
experiments 
were 
conducted 
in 
a 
randomized block design with three replicates. 
Data were analyzed using ANOVA and regression 
analysis. 
Result and discussion 
Biomass production and phytotoxicity symptoms 
During the growing period, the dry matter yield 
from the leaves, stems, and roots did not change 
with the dose of Pb in the nutrient solution (Table 
1). Some researchers have shown that Pb toxicity 
causes a reduced transpiration rate and inhibition of 
the photosynthetic rate, resulting in visual changes 
such as slowed growth, foliar chlorosis, leaf wilt, and 
fruit deformation (Zhao, Ye, & Zheng, 2011; Lou, 
Luo, Hu, Li, & Fu, 2012). However, our castor bean 
plants did not exhibit any of these symptoms, 
suggesting they are tolerant to the metal. Differences 
between cultivars could result in lesser or greater 
susceptibility to heavy metal stress (Romeiro et al., 
2006; Niu, Sun, & Sun, 2009; Costa et al., 2012).

Pb distribution in plants 
Greater Pb doses were accompanied by 
increased Pb concentrations in the leaves and 
roots (Figure 1). From the control to the highest 
Pb dose (200 μmol L-1), the increase was 52% in 
the leaves and 48572% in the roots, similar to 
what was found by Romeiro et al. (2006). In that 
case, accumulation was approximately 500 mg kg-1 
and 24,000 mg kg-1 in the leaves and roots, 
respectively, at a Pb dose of 200 μmol L-1. Costa et 
al. (2012) verified that the distribution of metal is 
1.4% in the leaves and 98.6% in the roots in castor 
bean plants grown with a Pb dose of 96 mg L-1. 
We found that when dosing with Pb at 200 
μmol L-1, the roots contained 382 times the 
amount in the leaves. Metal sequestration in the 
vacuoles of the root cells is a defense mechanism 
of plants that prevents the absorbed metal from 
being translocated to the aerial areas (Kumar et 
al., 2012). The ABC transporter gene is one 
responsible for detoxifying Pb in the roots of 
plants (Pal, Banerjee, & Kundu, 2013). The 
highest accumulation (1,312 mg kg-1 of Pb) in the 
roots of plants grown with the 200 μmol L-1 dose 
of Pb demonstrates the defense strategy in which 
the roots contribute to the plant’s tolerance when 
high doses of this metal are in the soil. This is also 
an outstanding, advantageous feature for the 
phytostabilization or phytoattenuation of lead-
contaminated areas. The benefit of vegetal 
coverage is accompanied by the advantage of a 
natural barrier, preventing the metal from being 
transported by erosion, leaching, or runoff (Melo, 
Costa, Guilherme, Faquin, & Nascimento, 2009; 
Andreazza, Bortolon, Pieniz, & Camargo, 2013; 
Pandey, 2013).

plants grown under different Pb doses in the nutrient solution. * 
and **: significant at the 5% and 1% probability levels, 
respectively. 
Some 
researchers 
have 
shown 
that 
Pb 
accumulation in the cells of roots can be observed in 
several cellular components, inducing tolerance or 
indirectly 
causing 
disturbances 
in 
the 
photosynthetic, 
nutritional, 
and 
metabolic 
apparatuses of plants. Piechalak, Tomaszewska, 
Baralkiewicz, and Małecka (2002), evaluating the 
accumulation and distribution of Pb in fava (Vicia 
faba), pea (Pisum sativum), and bean (Phaseolus 
vulgaris) plants, found that after a 96-h exposure to a 
dose of 0.001 mol L-1, only 5% to 10% of the 
accumulated metal was translocated to the shoots, 
and the greatest Pb content, found in the roots, was 
located in cell walls and nuclei. These authors also 
noted that if 1% of the Pb accumulated in the 
cytoplasm of the root cells, then it was sufficient to 
activate the plant’s defense mechanism and raise the 
production of phytochelatins. Samardakiewicz and 
Woźny (2000), evaluating the accumulation of Pb in 
the root cells of an aquatic plant (Lemna minor L.), 
verified that after 1h of exposure to the metal (at 15 
μmol L-1), greater accumulation could be found in 
the cell walls, vesicles, and small vacuoles. Kopittke 
et al. (2008), evaluating Pb accumulation in the root 
cells of Brachiaria (Brachiaria decumbens Stapf) plants 
and Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana Knuth), found the 
initial presence of the metal in the cytoplasm and 
cortical cells when the dose was no more than 20 
μmol L-1 and 5.5 μmol L-1, respectively. A greater 
part was sequestered by the vacuole in the form of 
pyromorphite [Pb5 (PO4) 3Cl]. These authors 
suggested that the presence of pyromorphite in the 
Golgi complex is an additional defense mechanism 
against Pb accumulation in the cell wall of the roots 
of Brachiaria plants, a behavior not observed for 
Rhodes grass, a plant that is sensitive to Pb. Meyers 
et al. (2008), evaluating the distribution of Pb in the 
root system of Indian mustard (Brassica juncea), 
verified the deposition of this metal in extracellular 
compartments, suggesting that this complexation 
occurred as a result of Pb binding to anionic sites. 
Małecka, Piechalak, Morkunas, and Tomaszewska 
(2008), studying the defense mechanism of pea 
plants (Pisum sativum) under conditions of Pb 
toxicity, verified changes in root mitochondria 
treated with Pb at a dose of 0.5 or 1.0 mmol L-1. 
They found reductions in mitochondrial crests, 
increases in mitochondrial volume, changes in 
mitochondrial shapes, and the presence of granules 
within peroxisomes and mitochondria when Pb was 
present. The authors state that Pb toxicity is relevant 
in these non-photosynthetic organelles because they 
are responsible for ATP generation and the storage 
of antioxidant enzymes, which is performed in the 
peroxisomes (Mhamdi, Noctor, & Baker, 2012). 
Chlorophyll fluorescence 
Differences 
in 
the 
absorption 
peaks 
in 
chlorophyll fluorescence spectra were observed 
(Figure 2a). The lowest fluorescence reabsorption 
was observed in plants grown at the greatest Pb dose 
(Figure 
2b), 
demonstrating 
that 
chlorophyll 
fluorescence is sensitive enough to detect changes in 
photosystem II (PSII) caused by Pb toxicity in 
plants. 
The Fr/FFr ratio shows that Pb doses promoted 
temporal changes in photosynthetic biosynthesis, 
and these were detected after as few as 10 days of 
cultivation and became more intense 18 days after 
the addition of the metal (Figure 3a). It is interesting 
to note that the increase in chlorophyll fluorescence 
ratios corroborated the Pb levels in the leaves 
(Figure 3b), indicating that the plants presented 
stress in the photosynthetic apparatus even without 
displaying visual Pb toxicity symptoms. The stress 
resulting from heavy metals causes poorer efficiency 
in the PSII reaction, triggering inhibition in the

Wasilewska, Fristedt, Vener, & Zienkiewicz, 2012) 
at the association of thylakoids with polyamine 
molecules, in turn inducing a process of re-
adaptation in the photosynthetic apparatus at the 
molecular level (Abreu, Coscione, Pires, & Paz-
Ferreiro, 2012).

of the control and Pb treated castor bean plants leaves (a) and 
Maximum intensity of the chlorophyll fluorescence for the 
highest doses of Pb in the nutrient solution (b). 
Measuring chlorophyll fluorescence is non-
destructive, and it can evaluate changes in 
chloroplast membranes and elucidate damage in the 
photosynthetic apparatuses of plants (Krause & 
Weis, 1991). The values for the Fv/Fm ratio 
(maximum fluorescence / maximum fluorescence 
emission variation) and Fr/FFr ratio (maximum 
peak in the red / peak region in the red-distal 
region), obtained by measuring the chlorophyll 
fluorescence bands, can be used to detect stress in 
PSII. A decline in chlorophyll concentration 
indicates an abnormal condition in the photon 
metabolism and, consequently, a reduction in the 
Fv/Fm ratio. However, the Fr/FFr ratio increases 
when PSII is disturbed. The Fv/Fm and Fr/FFr 
ratios demonstrate opposite behaviors under normal 
photosynthetic conditions (Marques & Nascimento, 
2013; Silva et al., 2015).

of the cultivation time: red = 680–700 nm and far-red = 730–740 
nm (Fr/FFr) (a). Ratio of chlorophyll fluorescence spectra at 28 
days in castor bean plants grown under different Pb doses in the 
nutrient solution, referring to the red and farred (Fr/FFr) 
readings and Pb content in the leaves (b).  
Use of the Fr/FFr ratio allowed detection of 
changes in PSII when plants showed no visual 
symptoms of toxicity. Therefore, chlorophyll 
fluorescence is a useful tool for monitoring Pb 
toxicity in castor bean plants, corroborating results 
found in studies of Cd toxicity (Silva, Nascimento, 
Gouveia-Neto, & Silva-Jr., 2012; Marques & 
Nascimento, 2013; Silva, et al., 2017), As toxicity 
(Stoeva, Berova, & Zlatev, 2004; (Silva et al., 2015), 
Ni toxicity (Gopal, Mishra, Zeeshan, Prasad, & 
Joshi, 2002; Mishra & Gopal, 2008), Cu and Hg 
toxicities (Ventrella, Catucci, Piletska, Piletsky, & 
Agostiano, 2009), Zn (Cherif et al., 2010; Marques 
& Nascimento, 2014; Marques et al., 2017) and Pb 
toxicity (Marques et al., 2017). 
Pigments, enzyme activities, and total soluble protein 
Pigment concentrations were not influenced by 
Pb (Table 2). Interestingly, these results corroborate 
the non-visualization of any chlorosis symptoms in 
Page 6 of 9  
Nascimento and Marques 
Acta Scientiarum. Agronomy, v. 40, e39392, 2018 
the leaves as well as the absence of nutritional 
imbalance (data not shown). In addition, although 
Pb 
did 
not 
cause 
damage 
to 
chlorophyll 
biosynthesis, a remarkable change in chlorophyll 
fluorescence was observed, indicating that this 
technique is efficient for early detection of Pb 
toxicity at the membrane level of chloroplasts in 
castor bean plants. According to Buschmann (2007), 
the Fr/FFr ratio depends primarily on chlorophyll 
content and, to a lesser extent, the photosynthetic 
activity, 
optical 
characteristics 
and 
cellular 
arrangements of the leaf tissue. According to 
Siedlecka and Krupa (2004), Rubisco (ribulose-1.5-
bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) is an abundant 
and very important enzyme in the Calvin cycle 
because 
it 
participates 
in 
the 
catalysis 
of 
carboxylation and oxygenation reactions. Under 
stress by heavy metals, these can substitute the Mg 
in the active center or subunits of the Rubisco and, 
consequently, hinder its normal activity, causing 
changes in the Calvin cycle function. This inhibits 
electron transport in the photosynthetic apparatus 
and damage to PSII. 
No significant response to the presence of Pb 
was observed in the activities of the enzymes 
ascorbate 
peroxidase, 
catalase, 
and 
polyphenoloxidase or in total soluble protein 
concentration (Table 3). Heavy metal toxicity could 
induce production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
such as superoxide, hydroxyl radicals, and hydrogen 
peroxide, all of which interact with cellular 
components, 
causing 
oxidative 
damage 
and 
subsequent cellular deterioration (Gadjev, Stone, & 
Gechev, 2008). In plant species tolerant to heavy 
metals, ROS content can be controlled by an 
efficient mechanism of antioxidant enzymes (Jamil, 
Abhilash, Singh, & Sharma, 2009; Lin & Aarts, 2012; 
Juknys, Vitkauskaite, Račaite, & Vencloviene, 2012). 
This is an important defense mechanism in the 
homeostatic balance that reduces heavy metal 
toxicity in plants (Sun, Zhou, Sun, & Jin, 2007; 
Yadav et al., 2009). 
Nautiyal and Sinha (2012) did not observe 
changes in chlorophyll a concentration in pigeon pea 
(Cajanus cajan) leaves with Pb doses up to 0.2 mmol 
L-1, but the production of carotenoids was 
stimulated at a dose of 0.05 mmol L-1. These authors 
also observed that Pb doses up to 1 mmol L-1 caused 
proline accumulation and induced elevation in the 
activities of the enzymes ascorbate peroxidase and 
superoxide dismutase in the leaves as well as an 
increase in non-protein substances with thiol groups 
in the roots. Alkhatib et al. (2011), evaluating the 
toxicity of Pb in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), verified 
that the metal did not affect pigment content. The 
authors did not observe anomalies in the thylakoid 
membranes when Pb was less than 10 μmol L-1; 
however, chloroplasts treated with 500 μmol L-1 
exhibited alterations in their compositions and fewer 
thylakoids. On the other hand, our results were 
contrary to those found by Kiran and Prasad (2017), 
who verified a reduction in chlorophyll a and b 
content 
in 
the 
leaves 
of 
R. 
communis 
by 
approximately 50% and 30% at Pb doses of 200 and 
400 μM, respectively. Pal et al. (2013) found a 23% 
reduction in chlorophyll a and b content in R. 
communis when the soil was dosed with 800 mg kg-1 
Pb.

Lead toxicity to castor bean plants 
Page 7 of 9 
Acta Scientiarum. Agronomy, v. 40, e30392, 2018 
 
R. communis cv. BRS Energia showed integrity in 
chlorophyll a and b content, the activities of 
antioxidant enzymes, and the concentration of total 
soluble protein under Pb stress. An important 
defense mechanism used by the plants was metal 
accumulation in the roots and survival without 
greater damage from the metal. 
Conclusion 
The use of chlorophyll fluorescence is efficient 
for detecting changes in photosystem II that result 
from Pb toxicity. Lead doses do not cause alterations 
in photosynthetic pigments, antioxidant enzyme 
activities, and total soluble proteins in the leaves, 
showing metal tolerance. The castor bean, because 
of its tolerance of Pb and ability to accumulate Pb in 
the 
roots, 
can 
be 
an 
environmentally 
and 
economically 
attractive 
alternative 
for 
phytostabilization and phytoattenuation of lead-
contaminated areas. It has the additional economic 
advantage of providing oil for industrial purposes 
and bioenergy production while it is used during 
remediation.
