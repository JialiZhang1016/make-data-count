In the present study, we characterise a strain isolated from the wastewater aeration lagoon of a sugar 
processing plant in Schleswig (Northern Germany) by Heinz Schlesner. As a pioneer in planctomycetal 
research, he isolated numerous strains belonging to the phylum Planctomycetota from aquatic 
habitats around the world. Phylogenetic analyses show that strain ­SH412T belongs to the family 
Planctomycetaceae and shares with 91.6% the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with 
Planctopirus limnophila DSM ­3776T. Its genome has a length of 7.3 Mb and a G + C content of 63.6%. 
Optimal growth of strain ­SH412T occurs at pH 7.0–7.5 and 28 °C with its pigmentation depending on 
sunlight exposure. Strain ­SH412T reproduces by polar asymmetric division (“budding”) and forms 
ovoid cells. The cell size determination was performed using a semi-automatic pipeline, which we 
first evaluated with the model species P. limnophila and then applied to strain ­SH412T. Furthermore, 
the data acquired during time-lapse analyses suggests a lifestyle switch from flagellated daughter 
cells to non-flagellated mother cells in the subsequent cycle. Based on our data, we suggest that 
strain ­SH412T represents a novel species within a novel genus, for which we propose the name 
Planctoellipticum variicoloris gen. nov., sp. nov., with strain ­SH412T (= CECT ­30430T = ­STH00996T, 
the STH number refers to the Jena Microbial Resource Collection JMRC) as the type strain of the new 
species.

Initially classified as ­eukaryotes1, members of the phylum Planctomycetota were only later acknowledged as 
­bacteria2. Along with two eponymous and some other sister phyla, they form the Planctomycetota-Chlamydiota-
Verrucomicrobiota (PVC) superphylum, whose ubiquitous members are of high medical and biotechnological 
­relevance3–5. Similar to the other lineages of this superphylum, planctomycetes possess certain unique traits, 
some of which seemed to challenge the fundamental differences between pro- and eukaryotes and led to several 
alternative hypotheses about the evolution of ­eukaryotes6. For example, planctomycetes were proposed to lack 
­peptidoglycan7, to form compartmentalised ­cells8, to possess a nucleus-like ­structure9, and to be capable of an 
endocytosis-like ­mechanism10, whereby especially the latter is a hallmark trait of eukaryotes. However, advances

in high-resolution imaging techniques as well as the development of genetic tools for ­planctomycetes11–13 led 
to reinvestigations that induced a paradigm shift in planctomycetal research (for review see Wiegand et al.6). 
Thereby, planctomycetes were found to possess ­peptidoglycan14,15 and although exceptional in several other cell 
biological aspects, the cell envelope architecture of planctomycetes is considered like that of diderm (Gram-
negative) ­bacteria16–18. Planctomycetal cells turned out to possess an enlarged periplasm with complex invagina-
tion patterns of the cytoplasmic ­membrane16. Combined with the crateriform structures found on the surface 
of various planctomycetes, these invaginations are presumably involved in a yet uncharacterised mechanism for 
the uptake of entire high molecular weight polysaccharide molecules and their ­degradation6,16.
Although some of the controversy is now resolved, members of the phylum Planctomycetota are still excep-
tional. They employ different division modes, either a mode of asymmetric polar reproduction (“budding”) 
(class Planctomycetia), binary fission (classes Phycispherae and Candidatus Brocadiae), or a combination of both 
­types19, while lacking most of the canonical bacterial cell division enzymes including the contractile Z-ring-
forming key player ­FtsZ19–21. Some strains, as for example the model species Planctopirus limnophila, have been 
reported to undergo a lifestyle switch, with attached cells reproducing asymmetrically at the pole opposite to the 
surface-anchored holdfast structure. Newly produced daughter cells are flagellated and swim until they attach 
to a surface and start to divide ­themselves6,11,22,23.
Besides their uncommon cell biology, planctomycetal genomes are just as intriguing and hold potential for 
biotechnological application of this phylum. In comparison to members of other bacterial phyla, planctomycetes 
can possess exceptionally large genomes of up to 12.4 Mb (Fimbriiglobus ruber) and are the phylum containing 
the most predicted genes with unknown ­function6,24,25. Genome sizes also differ highly between the currently 
described classes of the phylum (Planctomycetia: 4.8–12.4 Mb, Phycisphaerae and Ca. Brocadiae: 3.0–4.3 Mb). 
As shown in the past years, members of the phylum Planctomycetota produce small molecules with possible 
health-promoting ­bioactivities5,26–29. Among the small molecules recently discovered in planctomycetes are 
­stieleriacines30–32, ­carotenoids33,34 and an aromatic compound potentially acting as a plant ­toxin35.
Here, we characterise strain ­SH412T, which was isolated by Heinz Schlesner (Institute for Microbiology, 
Christian-Albrechts-University, Kiel, Germany) in the late 1980s from the wastewater aeration lagoon of a sugar 
processing plant in Schleswig, a town in Northern Germany. Strain ­SH412T is one of approximately 257 strains 
whose isolation has been reported in ­199436. However, a polyphasic analysis of phenotypic and genomic features 
has not yet been conducted for many strains from Schlesner’s ­collection37. In addition, we present a standardised, 
semi-automatic pipeline for cell size determination employing light microscopy, which was first tested with the 
limnic model planctomycete Planctopirus limnophila DSM ­3776T and then applied to the novel strain.
Materials and methods
Isolation and cultivation
Strain ­SH412T was isolated by Heinz Schlesner (Institute for Microbiology, Christian-Albrechts-University, Kiel, 
Germany) from a wastewater aeration lagoon of a sugar processing plant in Schleswig (Northern Germany). At 
the sampling site, a conductivity of 6270 µS/cm and a pH of 7.8 were measured. The strain was isolated on M31PY 
medium and routinely cultivated at 28 °C in the same medium. P. limnophila DSM ­3776T served for testing of 
the cell size determination pipeline and was cultivated in limnic M1 medium at 28 °C. 1 L M31PY medium 
contained Mineral Salt Solution (Hutner’s Basal Salts, 20 mL, see below), BD Bacto Peptone (0.25 g), BD Bacto 
Yeast Extract (0.25 g), Tris/HCl (final concentration 5 mM), ­CaCl2 × 2 ­H2O (0.1 g) and ­MgCl2 × 6 ­H2O (0.1 g). 
The pH was adjusted to 7.5 in liquid cultures and pH 8.5 for agar plates. After autoclaving, the following amounts 
of sterile-filtered solutions were added: N-acetyl glucosamine solution (40 mL of 50 g/L stock), vitamin solution 
(5 mL, see below) and ­Na2HPO4 × 2 ­H2O solution (1 mL of 100 g/L stock). For solidified medium, 15 g/L agar,

were added: glucose solution (4 mL, 25% (v/w) stock), vitamin solution (5 mL, see below), N-acetyl glucosa-
mine (20 mL, 50 g/L stock), and trace element solution (1 mL, see below). The following supplemental solutions 
were prepared for both media: 1 L vitamin solution contained p-aminobenzoic acid (0.01 g), biotin (0.004 g), 
pyridoxine hydrochloride (0.02 g), thiamine hydrochloride (0.01 g), sodium pantothenate (0.01 g), folic acid 
(0.004 g), riboflavin (0.01 g), nicotinamide (0.01 g) and vitamin ­B12 (0.0002 g). 1 L Mineral Salt Solution (Hutner’s 
Basal Salts) contained nitrilotriacetic acid (10 g), ­MgSO4 × 7 ­H2O (29.7 g), ­CaCl2 × 2 ­H2O (3.34 g), ­FeSO4 × 7 
­H2O (0.099 g) and Metal Salt Solution 44 (50 mL). 1 L of Metal Salt Solution 44 contained ­Na2-EDTA (250 g), 
­ZnSO4 × 7 ­H2O (1.095 g), ­FeSO4 × 7 ­H2O (0.5 g), ­MnSO4 × ­H2O (0.154 g), ­CuSO4 × 5 ­H2O (0.0395 g), ­CoCl2 × 6 
­H2O (0.0203 g) and ­Na2B4O7 × 10 ­H2O (0.0177 g). 1 L Trace Element Solution (used only for limnic M1 medium) 
contained sodium nitrilotriacetate (1.5 g), ­MnSO4 × 7 ­H2O (0.5 g), ­FeSO4 × 7 ­H2O (0.1 g), Co(NO3)2 × 6 ­H2O

(0.01 g), ­H3BO3 (0.01 g), ­NaMoO4 × 2 ­H2O (0.01 g), ­Na2WO4 × 2 ­H2O (0.01 g).
Initial PCR‑based amplification of the 16S rRNA gene
An amplification and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene of the novel isolate was performed to determine its phy-
logenetic position and degree of novelty. The sequencing was also used to check the purity of the axenic culture. 
Colonies from plates were lysed by boiling (95 °C, 3 min) and subsequent freezing (three times repeated). Prior to 
genome sequencing, extracted gDNA was used as PCR template to check for purity. The following primers were 
used for the amplification reaction: eubplancto8f 5′-AGA​GTT​TGATCMTGG​CTC​AG-3′ and eubplancto1492r

5′-GGY​TAC​CTT​GTT​ACG​ACT​T-3′. Dream Taq DNA Polymerase (Thermo Scientific) was employed for the 
reaction and the PCR was performed using the following program: Initial denaturation for 2 min at 95 °C, fol-
lowed by 45 cycles of denaturation (30 s at 95 °C), annealing (30 s), and elongation (2 min at 72 °C). Thereby the 
annealing temperature was 54 °C during the first ten and 49 °C during the remaining 35 cycles. Afterwards, the 
PCR was concluded by a final elongation step for 7 min at 72 °C. For sequencing, samples were prepared with the 
primer eubplancto8f to obtain a partial 16S rRNA sequence. Sequencing was performed by Macrogen Europe.
Isolation of genomic DNA
Genomic DNA for long-read sequencing was isolated using the Wizard HMW DNA Extraction Kit (Promega) 
following the manufacturer’s instructions. The obtained gDNA was quantified using the Qubit fluorometer with 
the Qubit dsDNA BR-Assay-Kit (Thermo Scientific). DNA quality and purity were determined using NanoDrop 
2000 (Thermo Scientific) absorbance measurements at 230, 260 and 280 nm. Integrity and fragment length 
distribution of obtained gDNA were analysed with the 4150 TapeStation System using Genomic DNA reagents 
and ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies).
Long‑read sequencing with Oxford Nanopore and genome assembly
For nanopore long-read sequencing, a multiplex sequencing library was prepared from at least 400 ng of high 
quality gDNA per sample according to the manufacturer’s protocol for the Native Barcoding Kit 24 (SQK-
NBD112.24, Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Briefly, the DNA was repaired using the NEBNext FFPE DNA 
Repair Mix and the NEBNext Ultra II End Repair/dA-tailing Module reagents (New England Biolabs). A clean-up 
was performed with one volume of AMPure XP Beads (Beckman Coulter) per sample volume. The equimolar 
mass of each DNA sample was taken forward to the native barcode ligation step using the NEB Blunt/TA Ligase 
Mix (New England Biolabs) and the ligation was stopped using EDTA. Barcoded DNA of all samples was pooled 
and cleaned with 0.4 volumes of AMPure XP Beads (Beckman Coulter). Sequencing adapters were ligated to 
the DNA using the NEBNext Quick Ligation Module (New England Biolabs) and another purification step with 
0.4 volumes of beads was performed. The washing steps were performed with Long Fragment Buffer (Oxford 
Nanopore Technologies) instead of 70% (v/v) ethanol to enrich DNA fragments larger than 3 kb. For sequenc-
ing, 5 to 10 fmol of the final library were loaded onto a primed R10.4 flowcell (FLO-MIN112, Oxford Nanopore 
Technologies). Sequencing was performed on a MinION Mk1B device (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). The 
raw nanopore sequencing data was basecalled using bonito version 0.5.3 with the basecalling model dna_10.4_
e8.1_sup@v3.4 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). The basecalled reads were filtered using NanoFilt 2.8.038 and 
only reads with a Phred quality score ≥ 10 were further processed. Demultiplexing and adapter trimming were 
performed using Guppy version 6.3.9 with the optional flag "–trim_barcodes" (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). 
Demultiplexed and trimmed reads were uploaded to the Galaxy web platform and the server available under the 
public domain usegalaxy.eu was used for the processing of the ­data39. We created and used a Galaxy workflow that 
is available at https://​usega​laxy.​eu/u/​domi/w/​copy-​of-​fastq​flyem​edaka​prokk​abusc​oquast. The workflow included 
NanoPlot version 1.28.2 for quality control of the nanopore ­reads38, Flye version 2.940,41 for genome assembly 
and Medaka version 1.4.4 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) for polishing of the raw assembly with the original 
long reads. The workflow also includes evaluation of the assembly completeness using BUSCO version 5.2.242,43 
and annotation of the assembled genome using Prokka version 1.14.644,45.
Polishing of the assembly with Illumina short reads and post‑processing
Library preparation and short-read sequencing using the Illumina NovaSeq platform was performed by Eurofins 
Genomics Germany GmbH. The Illumina reads (approx. 5 million read pairs, 2 × 150 bp) per strain were also 
uploaded to the Galaxy web server usegalaxy.eu39. We created and used another Galaxy workflow that is available 
via https://​usega​laxy.​eu/u/​domi/w/​copy-​of-​bwa-​mem2p​ilonp​rokka​busco​quast. The workflow comprises evalu-
ation of the Illumina reads using FastQC version 0.11.9 (https://​www.​bioin​forma​tics.​babra​ham.​ac.​uk/​proje​cts/​
fastqc/), mapping of Illumina reads to the genome assembly using BWA-MEM2 version 2.2.146–48 and polishing 
using Pilon version 1.2049. Evaluation of assembly completeness was performed again with BUSCO version 
5.2.242,43. The polished assembly was again annotated using Prokka version 1.14.644,45. The obtained genome was 
manually circularised and rotated to the start codon of the chromosomal replication initiator protein-encoding 
gene dnaA (according to the Prokka annotation). The genome was finally annotated using the NCBI Prokaryotic 
Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP) version 2022–12-13.build649450–52.
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers
The 16S rRNA gene and genome sequence of strain ­SH412T are available from the NCBI GenBank database 
under the accession numbers OR353748 and CP130886, respectively.
Phylogenomic analyses
The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain ­SH412T was extracted from the annotated genome and the identification 
of the closest neighbours of the novel isolate was performed using NCBI’s BLASTn suite (accessed on 5th July 
2023)53. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of strain ­SH412T and all characterised members of the phylum were 
aligned with ­ClustalW54. The alignment was used to calculate a 16S rRNA similarity matrix with ­TaxonDC55. The 
16S rRNA gene sequence-based maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was calculated from the same alignment 
with FastTree 2.156 employing the GTR + CAT model and 1000 bootstraps replications. Three 16S rRNA genes 
of bacterial strains from the PVC superphylum outside of the phylum Planctomycetota, namely Opitutus terrae 
(NCBI acc. no. AJ229235), Kiritimatiella glycovorans (acc. no. NR_146840) and Lentisphaera araneosa (acc. no. 
NR_027571), were used as outgroup. The multi-locus sequence-based phylogenetic analysis was performed using

pseudoceratinae ­JC658T (GCA_011634775.1). The genomes of Rhodopirellula baltica ­SH1T (GenBank acc. no. 
BX119912.1), Pirellula staleyi DSM ­6068T (acc. no. CP001848.1) and Blastopirellula marina DSM ­3645T (acc. no. 
GCA_000153105.1) (all belonging to the family Pirellulaceae) served as outgroup. Average amino acid identities 
(gAAI) and average nucleotide identities (gANI) were calculated using the respective scripts of the enveom-
ics ­collection58. The percentage of conserved proteins (POCP) was calculated as ­described59. The rpoB gene 
sequences were taken from publicly available genome annotations and sequence identities were determined as 
previously ­described60. The alignment and matrix calculation were performed upon extracting a 1298 bp region 
of the rpoB coding sequence that would have been sequenced with the described primer set. Alignment and 
matrix calculation were performed with Clustal ­Omega61.
Analysis of genome‑encoded features
The “Estimate Metabolism” function of anvi’o v. 7.162 was used for the analysis of genome-encoded primary meta-
bolic functions. Numbers of putative carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) were obtained from the genome 
annotation provided by eggnog-mapper v.2.1.1063. An in silico prediction of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) 
putatively involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites was carried out using antiSMASH ­764. The pre-
diction was run with relaxed strictness, antiSMASH beta features and all extra features activated. The genome 
completeness was assessed with BUSCO v5.4.743, while the coding density was analysed with CheckM v1.1.665.
Physiological analysis
For determination of the temperature optimum for growth, 100 µL supernatant of an exponentially growing 
culture (containing no visible aggregates) were plated and plates were incubated in triplicates at temperatures 
ranging from 4 to 37 °C. Plates were checked daily, and growth was evaluated by the time required until visible 
colonies were formed. The temperature at which colonies appeared the earliest was considered the temperature 
optimum for growth. The pH optimum for growth was determined in liquid cultures. For this purpose, Tris-buffer 
in M31PY was substituted by 100 mM of buffering agents 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) for pH 
5.0 and 6.0, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) for pH 7.0 and 8.0 and N-cyclohexyl-
2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (CHES) for pH 9.0 and 10.0, whereas for pH 7.5 standard M31PY liquid medium 
was used. Supernatant from a growing culture was used for inoculation and cultivation was performed at 24 °C 
in duplicates without agitation. The temperature was chosen after determining the temperature optimum for 
growth of strain ­SH412T and displays a compromise between fastest growth and most biomass production (see 
below). Growth was evaluated by eye by the amount of aggregates (biomass) formed after 18 days incubation, as 
optical density (OD) measurements are not possible with this strain. Anaerobic growth was examined on a plate 
that was incubated at 21 °C in an anaerobic jar. The presence of catalase was tested by transferring a colony of 
the strain into a drop of 3% (v/v) ­H2O2; the test is considered positive upon vigorous gas production. The pres-
ence of cytochrome c oxidase was tested with Kovács oxidase test reagent on filter paper, where a colour change 
towards dark blue indicates a positive test result.
Light microscopy
Phase-contrast and differential interference contrast (DIC) analyses were performed with a Nikon Eclipse Ti2 
inverted microscope, with a Nikon DS-Ri2 Camera and a Nikon CFI Plan Apochromat Lambda 100X oil immer-
sion objective (numerical aperture 1.45). For phase contrast analyses the objective additionally contained a 
Ph3 module. The Images were processed employing the Nikon NIS-Elements software (Version 5.30, https://​
www.​micro​scope.​healt​hcare.​nikon.​com/​de_​EU/​produ​cts/​softw​are/​nis-​eleme​nts) and FIJI (Version 2.9.0, https://​
downl​oads.​imagej.​net/​fiji/​relea​ses/2.​9.0/). Specimens were immobilised on a medium-supplemented 1% (w/v) 
agarose cushion, for time-lapse analyses the cover glass was sealed with VLAP (33% (w/w) vaseline, 33% (w/w) 
lanoline, 33% (w/w) paraffin) against the slide to minimise evaporation. Additional time-lapse analyses were 
performed in a Nunc Glass Base Dish (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 12 mm), which was incubated with supernatant 
of a growing culture for 24 h. Fluid was then discarded, and remaining cells were immobilised with an agarose 
cushion as described above.

Cell size determination
To test the new cell size determination pipeline, a pre-culture of the model strain P. limnophila DSM ­3776 T was 
grown to the mid-exponential phase and then split into independent replicates. For microscopy, these replicates 
were then grown until early exponential phase. This procedure ensured a reproducible cell size and prevented 
an overcrowded image during microscopy. Phase-contrast images were taken as described above. Since each 
image contained three channels (RGB), for further image analysis the second channel was duplicated and saved 
as a separate tiff file in FIJI. Length and width of the exact same 100 cells were analysed employing three differ-
ent methods: Firstly, two independent researchers measured the cells using the line and measurement tool in 
­FIJI66. Then, MicrobeJ (Version 5.13 m)67 and BacStalk (Version 1.8)68 were employed for size determination. 
For cell detection in MicrobeJ, the thresholding was set to bright, auto, and default mode. The area was set to 
1-max, length to 0.9–3, width to 0.5–2.5, and all other parameters were set to 0-max. Length and width of the 
detected cells were determined in medial axis mode. To analyse the cells in BacStalk, the respective images of 
one replicate were loaded into the software. The pixel size was set to 0.029 µm, the option for stalk detection was 
unchecked. The segmentation parameters were set to 20 pixels for cell size and 15 pixels for minimum cell size. 
All budding cells and aggregates were manually removed from the analysis and only solitary cells were analysed. 
The obtained data was transformed from .csv files to .xlsx files and uploaded separately into SuperPlotsOfData. 
For strain ­SH412T the cell size determination was done for three independently growing cultures (incubated at 
28 °C) and 150 cells from each of the supernatants were analysed as described above.
Analysis of light‑dependent pigmentation
To investigate an influence of light on the degree of pigmentation of the strain, duplicates were inoculated on 
agar plates and incubated in the same room either directly next to a window or covered in aluminium foil inside 
a cabinet.
Results and discussion
Phylogenetic analysis
The phylogenetic position of strain ­SH412T was determined based on its 16S rRNA gene sequence and MLSA 
(Fig. 1). In both constructed maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees, strain ­SH412T clusters in the family Planc-
tomycetaceae close to the characterised members of the genera Planctopirus and Schlesneria. While in the 16S 
rRNA gene sequence-based tree ­SH412T clusters between the two genera, in the MLSA-based tree it clusters 
outside of them. Both tree positions display good bootstrap support (96–100%). To further analyse the phyloge-
netic position of ­SH412T, five phylogenetic markers were evaluated: 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, gANI, 
gAAI, POCP and similarity of a 1298 bp partial sequence of the gene rpoB coding for the β-subunit of the RNA 
polymerase, which is an established phylogenetic marker within the order Planctomycetales60. The maximal 
gANI value of 76.7% between ­SH412T and the four closest neighbours showed that the strain does not belong to 
a described species (threshold of 95%69). Strain ­SH412T shares the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity

with P. limnophila DSM ­3776T (91.6%). Thus, taking the 16S rRNA gene similarity genus threshold of 94.5%70 
into account, ­SH412T belongs to a novel genus.
In contrast, comparison of the ­SH412T partial rpoB gene with members of the genus Planctopirus yielded 
values between 75.9 and 76.2%. Such values are in the genus threshold range of 75.5–78.0%71. However, the value 
obtained for a comparison with S. paludicola ­MPL7T (79.1%) is slightly above the genus threshold. Yet, results 
from the other phylogenetic analyses support ­SH412T as a new species of a distinct genus: a maximal gAAI value 
of 56.9% is obtained with S. paludicola ­MPL7T; with members of the genus Planctopirus values around 54% are 
obtained. These values are far below the genus threshold range of gAAI (60–80%)72,73. The same is true for the 
obtained POCP values (< 48.7%) which are below the accepted genus threshold of 50%59. Although the analysed 
phylogenetic markers imply different species as the current next relative of strain ­SH412T, four out of five markers 
suggest that the strain should be delineated from the described genera in the family Planctomycetaceae, forming 
a novel genus and species.
Genomic characteristics
The type strains of the two closest related genera were chosen for the comparison of genomic features of the 
novel isolate: P. limnophila DSM ­3776T74, P. ephydatiae ­spb1T75, P. hydrillae ­JC280T76, and S. paludicola ­MPL7T77 
(Table 1). The genome of strain ­SH412T is 7,276,092 bp in size and has a DNA G + C content of 63.6%. It is thereby 
considerably larger than the genomes of the current genus Planctopirus (5.2–5.8 Mb) but smaller than the one 
of S. paludicola ­MPL7T (8.7 Mb). Extrachromosomal elements are not present. Notably, the DNA G + C content 
of strain ­SH412T is almost 10 percentage points higher than in its currently closest relatives. Relevant additional 
genomic features are summarised in Table 1. The automatic gene annotation by NCBI’s Prokaryotic Genome 
Annotation Pipeline (PGAP) predicted 5608 protein-coding genes, of which 28% (1573 genes) are categorised 
as hypothetical proteins. In accordance with its larger genome, the number of predicted protein-coding genes 
of strain ­SH412T lies between the values of the genera Planctopirus and Schlesneria. However, strain ­SH412T has 
both the highest number of genes per Mb as well as highest coding density, although all values are within the 
same range. Furthermore, strain ­SH412T carries two copies of each rRNA gene, while most of its closest relatives

merely possess multiple copies of one of these genes. Remarkably, the genome of strain ­SH412T contains only 54 
tRNA genes, while all the other strains possess at least 20 more tRNA genes.
Analysis of genome‑encoded features
In order to predict metabolic capabilities of strain ­SH412T, the genome-based primary metabolism of the novel 
isolate was analysed with the “Estimate Metabolism” tool of anvi’o. All analyses in the following section were 
also performed again for the four type strains of the currently closest related genera (P. limnophila DSM ­3776 T, 
P. ephydatiae ­spb1T, P. hydrillae ­JC280T, and S. paludicola ­MPL7T), as this information was, given the historical 
context, either not available at all for some strains or different software/older software versions had been used 
previously. The results point towards a canonical central metabolism expected in a heterotrophic bacterium. A 
complete set of enzymes required for a functional glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, pentose phosphate 
pathway and respiratory chain is encoded in the genome. The strain harbours a gene coding for cytochrome c 
oxidase and but lacks catA (also referred to as katA) encoding catalase. A putative catalase superfamily protein 
was annotated by PGAP, but the protein lacks several domains that are typically found in catalases. These results 
from the genome annotation are in line with the results obtained for the respective enzyme activity tests (Table 2). 
Based on the functional annotation the strain should be capable of the de novo biosynthesis of fatty acids, 
nucleotides, proteinogenic amino acids and isoprenoids. At least two genes of strain ­SH412T code for vitamin 
­B12 (cobalamin)-dependent enzymes, namely the methionine synthase MetH and the class II ribonucleotide 
reductase NrdJ. Since the genome indicates the lack of a functional pathway for biosynthesis of this vitamin, the 
strain is likely auxotrophic for vitamin ­B12. The same was shown for the close relative P. limnophila78, but no data 
is available for the other three strains chosen for comparison.
Besides the central metabolism, we also analysed the genomes for putative carbohydrate-active enzymes 
(CAZymes) and biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), since members of the phylum Planctomycetota are expected 
to be of high biotechnological ­relevance6. The numbers of CAZymes of the analysed strains fall between 35 and 
50. The obtained numbers turned out to reflect the size of the genomes. Members of the genus Planctopirus have 
less than 40 putative CAZymes, whereas strain ­SH412T and S. paludicola ­MPL7T, both with considerable larger 
genomes, have 49 or 50 candidate CAZymes. Glycoside hydrolases and glycosyltransferases are the dominant 
classes of CAZymes in all four species.
Genome mining for BGCs by antiSMASH provides indications that strain ­SH412T produces terpenoids, 
polyketide compounds derived from type I polyketide synthases and ribosomally synthesised and post-transla-
tionally modified peptides. Despite the larger genome of strain ­SH412T compared to the type strains of the three 
Planctopirus species, it has an equal or even lower number of BGCs.
Macroscopic appearance and physiological characteristics
Detailed information on morphology and physiology of strain ­SH412T is summarised in Table 2. In terms of 
pigmentation, strain ­SH412T showed higher similarity with the pink- to red-coloured type strains of the genus 
Planctopirus, while S. paludicola ­MPL7T seems to lack pigment formation. Appearance of strain ­SH412T varied 
highly depending on different environmental conditions (Fig. 2), which has not been reported for any of its

currently closest relatives. Especially between plates and liquid cultures, the colour of strain ­SH412T differed 
significantly. Colonies on plates appeared intensely salmon- to pink- or red-coloured (Fig. 2A,B). Their colour 
intensity was furthermore found to relate to sun light exposure, with colonies grown in darkness being lighter 
coloured than colonies grown in daylight (Fig. 3A,B). Light exposure of colonies grown in darkness led to an 
increase of the pigmentation intensity compared to the control (Fig. 3C,D).
Cells in colonies adhered strongly to each other as well as to the solidified medium, forming round, shiny, and 
firm colonies (Fig. 2A,B). Colonies transferred from plate to liquid medium lost their colour within a few days 
and the freshly obtained liquid cultures appeared much lighter in colour. Thereby, most of the cells were part of 
large, salmon to pale pink, flake-like aggregates, which were impossible to resuspend by agitation (Fig. 2B,C). 
Aggregates usually emerged in the following manner: Cells attached to the surface of the cultivation tube forming 
a thin lawn. Especially under agitation, differently sized fragments of this lawn peeled off the walls, thus floating 
around as aggregates in the medium. Mostly, aggregates started off as thin, mat-like objects, but upon further 
incubation they disrupted and developed into thicker, more flake-like structures.
Strain ­SH412T can grow over a temperature range from 10 to 32 °C and a pH range from 6.0 to 8.0 (Fig. 4). 
Fastest growth of strain ­SH412T occurred at 28 °C (evaluated by time until first colonies appeared), however, 
most biomass was produced at 21 °C (evaluated by colony size). Formation of single colonies took about 10 days

at 28 °C and 14 days at 21 °C. After 21 days they had usually reached a diameter of about 2 mm but continued 
to grow. The pH optimum for growth is between pH 7.0 and 7.5. In that regard, strain ­SH412T resembles the 
mesophilic and neutrophilic members of the genus Planctopirus, as S. paludicola ­MPL7T is acidophilic. Due to 
its strong aggregation, growth rate and doubling time could not be determined photometrically. Yet, data from 
timelapse microscopy analyses suggests a doubling time of around 10 h (Fig. 5).
Strain ­SH412T turned out to grow under anaerobic conditions almost as well as under aerobic conditions, but 
colony morphology differed. While the lawn occurred light pink and opaque under aerobic conditions, under 
anaerobic conditions it was barely coloured and more translucent.
Hence, strain ­SH412T resembles the type strains of P. limnophila DSM ­3776T and S. paludicola ­MPL7T regard-
ing its relationship to oxygen, but no morphological differences under anaerobic conditions were reported for 
these strains. P. hydrillae ­JC280T, in contrast, is obligate aerobic. Strain ­SH412T is cytochrome c oxidase-positive 
like the type strains of P. limnophila DSM ­3776T, S. paludicola ­MPL7T, and P. hydrillae ­JC280T. In contrast to these 
strains, strain ­SH412T is catalase-negative (Table 2).
A new automated pipeline for the determination of the cell size
During the past few years, we determined the cell size for novel strains of the phylum Planctomycetota man-
ually by employing the measurement tool in the Nikon NIS-Elements ­software79,80. However, various semi-
automatic applications such as MicrobeJ and BacStalk exist that improve efficiency and reproducibility of the 
­measurement67,68. Testing the applicability of BacStalk as well as MicrobeJ for the purpose of describing novel 
bacterial strains, two independent researchers analysed the very same cells first manually and afterwards employ-
ing BacStalk as well as MicrobeJ (Fig. 6). For both measurements taken, researcher 2 obtained slightly higher 
values than researcher 1 as well as the two softwares. Since both semi-automatic solutions performed equally 
Figure 3.   Pigmentation of strain ­SH412T in dependence on illumination during growth. The plates were 
incubated for 20 days at 21 °C next to a window (A) or in complete darkness (B). Notably, the colonies appeared 
red-pink when grown in light and slightly salmon-coloured upon incubation in darkness. Afterwards, all plates 
were incubated next to the same window for three more days. Plates that were continuously incubated next 
to the window did not show any change in colour (C). On plates that were previously incubated in darkness, 
especially single colonies started to turn more red-pink (D).

well and offer the advantage that the algorithms will give the same results when using the same cultivation con-
ditions, software parameters, and input images, we recommend using such semi-automatic programs for cell 
size determination in strain description articles. Furthermore, high reproducibility can be achieved by imaging 
bacterial cells of different replicates at a very similar ­OD600 within the mid-exponential phase. For measuring 
the cell size of strain ­SH412T, we chose BacStalk, as this software, with its fewer options, is easier to employ 
for untrained researchers. However, for more complex analysis tasks and more complex cell shapes, MicrobeJ 
appears to be more suitable.
Microscopic analysis
Cells of strain ­SH412T measure 0.7–2.2 µm in width × 0.7–2.8 µm in length with most of them being ovoid, 
but few cells tend to be more spherical (Fig. 7). ­SH412T divides asymmetrically (polar budding) (Fig. 5 and 
Fig. 7 A, B) and single (daughter) cells were observed to be motile, while cells in aggregates did not show any 
movement. Since many genes required for flagellum formation were identified during annotation of the genome 
using PGAP and all type strains of the currently closest related genera (Planctopirus, Schlesneria) were found to 
possess flagella, it is likely that motility of strain ­SH412T is conferred by at least one flagellum as well.
In comparison to the four type strains of the genera Planctopirus and Schlesneria, strain ­SH412T encompassed 
a much wider range regarding its cell size. Regarding cell shape, strain ­SH412T resembles the representatives 
of the genus Planctopirus, which also form ovoid to spherical cells. The variety in cell size is an interesting 
observation, especially since both length and width can vary with a factor of 2.5 to 3 and thereby spread over 
an unusually wide range.
These differences found in cell size and motility could be explained by a life-style switch, which has been 
reported for various planctomycetes, including members of the two currently closest related genera. Producing 
both swarmer and sessile cells, P. limnophila has been shown to possess a life cycle with two distinct cell ­types11. 
Sessile, stalked mother cells thereby reproduce through budding opposite to the stalked pole and form motile 
swarmer cells with a single flagellum. The motile daughter cells later attach to surfaces or aggregates, turning 
into sessile cells that start to divide. Even though a size difference between the two cell types was not explicitly 
reported for this species, other studies on planctomycetal life cycles reported differences, i.e. daughter cells are 
about half the size of the mother cells by the time they are ­released23,81. Afterwards, daughter cells increase in 
size over a defined period before they become sessile. We therefore suggest that such a life cycle is also present 
in strain ­SH412T.
Conclusion
Based on both phylogenetic as well as morphological analyses, strain ­SH412T represents a new species within a 
new genus belonging to the family Planctomycetaceae, for which we propose the name Planctoellipticum vari-
icoloris gen. nov., sp. nov.
