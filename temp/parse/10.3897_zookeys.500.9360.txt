Abstract
Proteocephalidean tapeworms form a diverse group of parasites currently known from 315 valid species. 
Most of the diversity of adult proteocephalideans can be found in freshwater fishes (predominantly cat­
fishes), a large proportion infects reptiles, but only a few infect amphibians, and a single species has been 
found to parasitize possums. Although they have a cosmopolitan distribution, a large proportion of taxa 
are exclusively found in South America. We analyzed the largest proteocephalidean cestode molecular 
dataset to date comprising more than 100 species (30 new), including representatives from 54 genera 
(80%) and all subfamilies, thus significantly improving upon previous works to develop a molecular 
phylogeny for the group. The Old World origin of proteocephalideans is confirmed, with their more 
recent expansion in South America. The earliest diverging lineages are composed of Acanthotaeniinae and 
Gangesiinae but most of the presently recognized subfamilies (and genera) appear not to be monophyletic; 
a deep systematic reorganization of the order is thus needed and the present subfamilial system should be 
abandoned. The main characters on which the classical systematics of the group has been built, such as 
scolex morphology or relative position of genital organs in relation to the longitudinal musculature, are of 
limited value, as demonstrated by the very weak support for morphologically-defined subfamilies. How­

ever, new characters, such as the pattern of uterus development, relative ovary size, and egg structure have 
been identified, which may be useful in defining phylogenetically well-supported subgroups. A strongly 
supported lineage infecting various snakes from a wide geographical distribution was found. Although 
several improvements over previous works regarding phylogenetic resolution and taxon coverage were 
achieved in this study, the major polytomy in our tree, composed largely of siluriform parasites from the 
Neotropics, remained unresolved and possibly reflects a rapid radiation. The genus Spasskyellina Freze, 
1965 is resurrected for three species of Monticellia bearing spinitriches on the margins of their suckers.

Introduction
Proteocephalideans (Platyhelminthes: Cestoda) form a morphologically homogeneous 
group of tapeworms found worldwide in freshwater fishes, reptiles, and amphibians (a 
single species is known from marsupial mammals). To our knowledge 315 valid spe­
cies are currently known (unpublished), a large proportion of them being parasites of 
South American siluriform fishes (Freze 1965, Rego 1994).
Proteocephalideans historically formed their own order (Proteocephalidea with 
only one family, Proteocephalidae), the monophyly of which is strongly supported, 
but recent molecular analyses have placed them within a paraphyletic assemblage of 
‘hooked’ tetraphyllidean cestodes (formerly Onchobothriidae), parasites of sharks and 
rays, which has led to the erection of a new order, the Onchoproteocephalidea by Caira 
et al. (2014). However, the lack of any morphological synapomorphies for this new or­
der made this a somewhat controversial decision. For the purpose of the present paper, 
which is to study the internal relationships of the “terrestrial” onchoproteocephalid­
eans (= proteocephalideans), this point is marginal and the new scheme proposed by 
Caira et al. (2014) is not considered further.
Previous attempts to study the interrelationships of proteocephalideans resulted in 
overall poorly resolved phylogenies. At the morphological level, the difficulty of defin­
ing reliable informative characters has prevented the construction of a stable taxonomic 
arrangement of the group (Rego 1994, 1995). The traditionally accepted families Proteo­
cephalidae and Monticelliidae have been abandoned, and the whole group has been split 
into a number of subfamilies and genera, including the type genus Proteocephalus Wein­
land, 1858, which are sometimes obviously artificial because of their lack of synapomor­
phies and diversity of life-history traits (see de Chambrier et al. 2004c, 2009a). Molecular 
studies that have tried to resolve the proteocephalidean tree topology have largely been 
based on the variable domains (D1–D3) of the large nuclear ribosomal RNA subunit (28S 
rDNA), using increasingly larger datasets, i.e. 54 taxa analyzed by Zehnder and Mariaux 
(1999), and 75 taxa by de Chambrier et al. (2004c). Hypša et al. (2005) analyzed the 
phylogenetic relationships of only 52 taxa, but used sequences of three ribosomal RNA 
genes and the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2). Additional molecular studies mostly 
considered questions at the specific/generic level [e.g. the Proteocephalus aggregate (Scholz

et al. 2007); African Proteocephalus (de Chambrier et al. 2011); Testudotaenia Freze, 1965 
(de Chambrier et al. 2009a), Corallobothriinae (Rosas-Valdez et al. 2004, Scholz et al. 
2011)] or employed only a very limited taxon sampling (e.g. Zehnder and de Chambrier 
2000, Škeříková et al. 2001, de Chambrier et al. 2008, Scholz et al. 2013).
Although these studies have allowed for a better understanding of relationships 
within and between several subgroups, the major nodes of the proteocephalidean tree 
remain poorly supported, especially when considering the South American lineages. In 
the present contribution, an unprecedented collection of proteocephalidean samples 
have been gathered that includes the majority of all valid genera (54 out of 67), thus 
significantly increasing the taxon sampling within the order and adding representa­
tives from previously unrepresented subfamilies. 28S rDNA sequences homologous 
to those published in studies by Zehnder and Mariaux (1999) and de Chambrier et 
al. (2004c) have been generated, and the newly generated data has been analyzed in 
conjunction with those previously published. Thus, the 28S rDNA data presented here 
represent the most comprehensive sampling of proteocephalideans to date.
Methods
Taxon sampling
The present study is based on the evaluation of a dataset of proteocephalideans collect­
ed during long-term studies carried out by the present authors and their co-workers, 
especially as part of research activities linked to the NSF-PBI project “A Survey of the 
Tapeworms (Cestoda: Platyhelminthes) from Vertebrate Bowels of the Earth” (2008–
2014), which was aimed at mapping the global diversity of tapeworms. Despite signifi­
cant sampling effort covering all zoogeographical regions and the most important host 
groups, the number of studied proteocephalideans that parasitize amphibians remains 
relatively small due to the paucity of cestodes in these hosts. In addition, several newly 
described proteocephalideans from the southern part of the Neotropical Region (Ar­
gentina) were not available for molecular studies. Among the 13 proteocephalidean 
genera that are not represented in our sampling, none presently contains more than 
two species (see Caira et al. 2012).
All taxa considered in this study are listed in Table 1. Most taxa included in de 
Chambrier et al. (2004c) are included in the present analysis; however, some taxo­
nomical changes and novel identifications have taken place since this paper was pub­
lished: Proteocephalus pirarara (Woodland, 1935a) is now Scholzia emarginata (Dies­
ing, 1850); Ophiotaenia cf. gallardi is now Ophiotaenia sp.; Pseudocrepidobothrium sp. 
is now Pseudocrepidobothrium ludovici Ruedi & de Chambrier, 2012; Megathylacus 
brooksi Rego & Pavanelli, 1985 is now Megathylacus jandia (Woodland, 1934b); Spat­
ulifer cf. maringaensis is now Spatulifer maringaensis Pavanelli & Rego, 1989. All but 
five molecular samples are vouchered, and in 86% of cases the vouchers are the holog­
enophore (sensu Astrin et al. 2013).

Molecular phylogenetic analyses
Total genomic DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and sequencing were done as 
outlined in Scholz et al. (2013). Eighty-three published and 30 newly generated 28S 
rDNA sequences were combined and analysed in conjunction (see Table 1 for Gen­
Bank accession numbers and further details). Acanthobothrium sp. (‘Onchoproteo­
cephalidea’), Phyllobothrium lactuca Beneden, 1850 (Phyllobothriidea) and “Tetrap­
hyllidea” gen. sp. were used as outgroup taxa. Sequences were aligned with MAFFT 
(Multiple Alignment using Fast Fourier Transform, http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/
mafft/) using the default settings. An alignment mask excluding sites of uncertain 
positional homology was generated using ZORRO (Wu et al. 2012). ZORRO uses 
a pair Hidden Markov Model and a weighted sum of pairs scheme (guided by a refe­
rence tree) that sums up the probability that a given alignment column appears over 
the total alignment landscape, thus providing an objective estimate of whether po­
sitions consist of correctly aligned, homologous residues. Default settings were used 
except for the invocation of the – sample option; positions with confidence scores 
< 0.4 were excluded from subsequent analyses. MRMODELTEST v. 2.3 (Nylander 
2004) was used to select models of sequence evolution using the Akaike Information 
Criterion. Bayesian inference (BI) analysis was performed using MRBAYES version 
3.2 (Ronquist and Huelsenbeck 2003) using the GTR model of sequence evolution 
with proportion of invariant sites and gamma-distributed rate variation amongst 
sites (nst = 6, rates = invgamma). Default prior settings and heating schemes were 
used. Two parallel runs were performed for 10,000,000 generations and sampled 
every 1,000 generations. The burn-in was defined as the point at which the average 
standard deviation of split frequencies were < 0.01. Consensus trees were construc­
ted using the 50% majority rule and nodes with < 0.95 posterior probabilities (pp) 
were collapsed. Leaf-stability tests, implemented in P4 (Foster 2004), were carried 
out to identify unstable taxa. Given a set of trees, for each set of four taxa, the fre­
quency of the four possible resolutions of quartets was calculated. For each taxon, 
the highest percentages for quartets including that taxon were averaged and listed as 
“Maximum”. Therefore, unstable taxa across the trees were considered to be those 
that have lower average maximum percentages. In this study, the three taxa with the 
lowest “Maximum” values were eliminated from analyses in order to increase nodal 
support for the remaining groupings (Wilkinson 1996).
Morphological analysis
Taxonomic identification was performed on specimens fixed and mounted on mi­
croscope slides according to de Chambrier (2001). Uterine development was char­
acterized according to de Chambrier et al. (2004c) but a new “intermediate type” 
was recognized and is described below (see Fig. 2). The relative size of the ovary, i.e. 
the ovary to proglottid surface ratio, was calculated for each species according to the

method described in de Chambrier et al. (2012). Approximate values might be due to 
inaccurate drawings or fixation methods reported by the original authors. Eggs were 
examined in distilled water.

Results
Molecular phylogeny
The complete 28S rDNA dataset comprised 110 ingroup taxa (from 54 genera, repre­
senting all 13 currently recognized subfamilies) and three outgroup taxa. Importantly, 
46 genera were represented by their type species (see Table 1). The alignment consisted 
of 1937 characters of which 420 were excluded, leaving 1517 for the analyses.
In an initial BI analysis, several nodes had posterior probabilities (pp) < 0.95, 
resulting in a tree with only 60 well-supported nodes (see Suppl. material 1: Fig.1). 
In order to identify unstable taxa for subsequent exclusion, a leaf stability test was 
conducted. This revealed Vermaia pseudotropii (Verma, 1928), Sciadocephalus megalo­
discus Diesing, 1850 and Manaosia bracodemoca Woodland, 1935 to be the least stable 
taxa (see Suppl. material 2: Table 1). Curiously, the position of the longest branch­
ing taxon, Sandonella sandoni (Lynsdale, 1960), was very stable (Fig. 1b inset; Suppl. 
material 1: Fig.1, Suppl. material 2: Table 1). The positions of the excluded taxa were 
as follows: Vermaia pseudotropii was in an unresolved position at the base of the tree, 
Sciadocephalus megalodiscus was in an unresolved position in a clade composed of the 
ingroup taxa to the exclusion of Gangesiinae Mola, 1929 and Acanthotaeniinae Freze, 
1963, and Manaosia bracodemoca was in an unresolved position in the large subclade 
of Clade D (Suppl. material 1: Fig.1).
In a subsequent BI analysis, in which the above-mentioned three taxa had been 
excluded, three nodes had improved support (≥ 0.95 pp), resulting in 63 well-sup­
ported nodes in total (Fig. 1a, b). Thus, further topology descriptions are based on the 
better-supported tree in which nodes of particular interests were labeled Clades A–P 
(Fig. 1a, b). Specifically, those better-supported nodes concern the positions of (i) 
Postgangesia inarmata de Chambrier, Al-Kallak & Mariaux, 2003, (ii) Ritacestus ritaii 
(Verma, 1926), and (iii) the sister-group relationship between Choanoscolex sp. and 
Nomimoscolex sudobim Woodland, 1935 (Fig. 1a, b; Suppl. material 1: Fig.1). Thus, 
the Gangesiinae were shown to be non-monophyletic except for a clade composed of 
Electrotaenia malopteruri (Fritsch, 1886), Silurotaenia siluri (Batsch, 1786) and Gan­
gesia spp. (Fig. 1a).

The three earliest diverging lineages were formed of Pangasiocestus romani Scholz 
& de Chambrier, 2012 and the Acanthotaeniinae, where the Acanthotaeniinae were 
possibly non-monophyletic, split into a monophyletic Kapsulotaenia Freze, 1965, and 
a monophyletic assemblage of Acanthotaenia shipleyi + Australotaenia bunthangi + Ros­
tellotaenia spp. (posterior probability = 0.88; not shown), but where all three lineages 
took an unresolved position at the base of the tree.
The Gangesiinae formed three paraphyletic lineages composed of Ritacestus ritaii, 
Postgangesia inarmata, and a clade composed of Electrotaenia malopteruri, Silurotaenia 
siluri and Gangesia spp. (Fig. 1a), to the exclusion of the remainder of the tree (Clade A).
The remainder of the tree (Clade A) was structured as follows: The earliest diverging 
group consisted of Sandonella sandoni (Lynsdale, 1960) which parasitizes an ancient os­
teoglossiform fish in Africa and which formed the sister group to Clade E. The latter was 
composed of two monotypic sister taxa Glanitaenia de Chambrier, Zehnder, Vaucher & 
Mariaux, 2004 (Proteocephalinae) and Paraproteocephalus Chen in Dubinina, 1962 (Cor­
allobothriinae), both of which parasitize silurid catfishes in the Palearctic Region. These, 
in turn, formed the sister group to Clade F, which was composed of the Proteocephalus ag­
gregate (see de Chambrier et al. 2004c) from Holarctic teleosts, including two newly added 
species from North America, P. fluviatilis Bangham, 1925 and P. pinguis La Rue, 1911.
The next well-supported group structured of Clade G, which was exclusively com­
posed of taxa from African siluriforms belonging to three subfamilies (Corallobothrii­
nae, Marsypocephalinae and Proteocephalinae), and which formed the sister group to 
Clade H. The latter was composed of Scholzia emarginata, Proteocephalus hemioliopteri 
de Chambrier & Vaucher, 1997 and Zygobothrium megacephalum Diesing, 1850, all 
of which are anatomically similar parasites of the Neotropical catfish Phractocepha­
lus hemioliopterus (Bloch & Schneider, 1801), but which are traditionally placed in 
different subfamilies, and of a monophyletic group of Nearctic proteocephalideans 
(Clade I), all parasitizing channel catfish (Ictaluridae); members of Clade I are placed 
in the Corallobothriinae because they possess a metascolex.
The most derived assemblage, Clade B, remained largely unresolved, with five early 
diverging lineages composed of (i) Ephedrocephalus microcephalus Diesing, 1850, (ii) 
Crepidobothrium gerrardii Monticelli, 1900, (iii) a clade of Pseudocrepidobothrium spp. 
+ Proteocephalus macrophallus (Diesing, 1850), (iv) Clade J, composed of Rudolphiel­
la spp. + Cangatiella arandasi Pavanelli & Machado dos Santos, 1991 + Brooksiella 
praeputialis (Rego, Santos & Silva, 1974), and (v) Clade K, composed of Ophiotaenia 
spp., Macrobothriotaenia ficta (Meggitt, 1931), all parasites of snakes from various 
zoogeographical regions, and Thaumasioscolex didelphidis Cañeda-Guzmán, de Cham­
brier & Scholz, 2001, the only proteocephalidean found in possums; (i)–(iv) were 
exclusively from the Neotropics.
The large polytomy found in Clade C was, to a large degree, composed of pro­
teocephalideans parasitizing South American fishes (predominantly siluriforms of the 
families Pimelodidae, Auchenopteridae and Doradidae). Clade L formed the earliest 
diverging lineage of Clade C and was composed of Travassiella jandia (Woodland, 
1934), Houssayela sudobim (Woodland, 1935) and Proteocephalus kuyukuyu Wood­

land, 1935 and P. renaudi de Chambrier & Vaucher, 1994. The sister group to the 
large polytomy in Clade C was formed of Clade M, which included Jauella glandicepha­
lus Rego & Pavanelli, 1985, Nomimoscolex suspectus Zehnder, de Chambrier, Vaucher 
& Mariaux, 2000, N. dorad (Woodland, 1935) and N. piraeeba Woodland, 1934. 
The remainder of Clade C formed largely a comb which comprised, amongst others, 
Testudotaenia testudo (Magath, 1924), a parasite of North American soft-shelled turtles 
and bowfin (Amia calva), a clade of Proteocephalus sp. and Proteocephalus perlexus La 
Rue, 1911, parasitizing North American catfish and bowfins respectively, two distinct 
clades of Ophiotaenia La Rue, 1911, Clade N (parasites of South American snakes) and 
Clade O (parasites of European and Nearctic snakes), and two unresolved Ophiotaenia 
species, O. filaroides La Rue, 1909 and O. saphena Osler, 1931, parasitizing North 
American salamanders and frogs, respectively.
The possible monophyly of 17 proteocephalidean genera could be examined, at 
least preliminarily, because two or more species of these genera were included in our 
analyses (numerous proteocephalidean genera are monotypic or species-poor). Ac­
cording to the current taxon sampling, the following genera, listed alphabetically, ap­
peared monophyletic (the numbers in parentheses indicate the total number of spe­
cies sequenced and the number of distinct lineages in which species of a given genus 
appeared): Corallobothrium Fritsch, 1886 (2/1), Gangesia Woodland, 1924 (2/1), 
Gibsoniela Rego, 1984 (2/1), Kapsulotaenia Freze, 1965 (3/1), Marsypocephalus Wedl, 
1861 (2/1), Megathylacoides Jones, Kerley & Sneed, 1956 (3/1), Peltidocotyle Dies­
ing, 1850 (2/1), Proteocephalus aggregate (11/1), Rostellotaenia Freze, 1963 (2/1) and 
Spasskyellina Freze, 1965 (2/1) (see discussion below for the latter). The monophyly 
of Rudolphiella Fuhrmann, 1916 (2/1) was not rejected by these results. In contrast, 
Pseudocrepidobothrium Rego & Ivanov, 2001 (2/2) is paraphyletic and the genera Am­
photeromorphus Diesing, 1850 (4/3), Choanoscolex La Rue, 1911 (2/2), Nomimoscolex 
Woodland, 1934 (9/7), Ophiotaenia (12/10) and Proteocephalus (20/7) appeared to be 
polyphyletic based on their current classification.
Morphological analysis
At the morphological level, the ovary to proglottid surface ratio ranged between 2.0% in 
Ophiotaenia grandis La Rue, 1911 to 20.8% in Zygobothrium megacephalum (Table 1). 
Examination of new whole mounts also identified a novel form of the uterine develop­
ment in addition to those described by de Chambrier et al. (2004c). This development 
is characterized as follows: in immature proglottids, the uterine stem forms an elongated 
concentration of chromophilic cells; in premature proglottids the chromophilic cells 
concentrate in areas where lateral uterine extensions will develop; in mature proglottids, 
a tubular uterine stem appears and develops small thin-walled lateral diverticula topped 
with a conspicuous concentration of numerous intensely stained cells; in pregravid and 
gravid proglottids, the lateral diverticula grow and eventually occupy most of the pro­
glottid width (Fig. 2b, d). We call this development “intermediate type”.

Discussion
Since the publications of de Chambrier et al. (2004c) and Hypša et al. (2005), no at­
tempt has been made to unravel the phylogenetic structure of proteocephalideans. Two 
immediate observations can be made when comparing our results to the de Chambrier 
et al. (2004c) tree: (1) an overall better resolution is achieved with the increased taxon 
sampling; and (2) all clades that were supported in de Chambrier et al. (2004c) remain so 
in these results. However, a number of differences can also be noted as discussed below.
Early diverging lineages – Acanthotaeniinae and Gangesiinae
In both de Chambrier et al. (2004c) and the present study, the Gangesiinae from Si­
luriformes, mostly in Indomalaya and Palearctic (but with one species in Afrotropics), 
and Acanthotaeniinae from reptiles in Australasia, Afrotropic and Indomalaya are early 
diverging lineages. However, their order is now reversed with the Acanthotaeniinae, to­
gether with Pangasiocestus romani (Gangesiinae), taking the earliest diverging position. 
Thus, the present results suggest either the paraphyly of the subfamily or the necessity 
to handle Pangasiocestus Scholz & de Chambrier, 2012 as an independent lineage. This 
monotypic genus was initially placed in the Gangesiinae based on its scolex morpho­
logy, which is characterized by a large rostellum-like apical organ. However, it differs 
from all gangesiine in a number of morphological characteristics. These include the 
peculiar, rosette-like scolex with a large, discoidal apical organ devoid of hooks; a very 
weakly-developed inner longitudinal musculature, which does not form bundles (unli­
ke those of other gangesiine genera, which form numerous bundles of muscle fibers; 
see Scholz et al. 1999, de Chambrier et al. 2003, de Chambrier et al. 2004b, Ash et al. 
2012 for more details); and the variable size of testes, which are considerably smaller 
and denser in the lateral than in the median field. These morphological features support 
the separation of Pangasiocestus from the Gangesiinae, as shown by our genetic analysis, 
despite the superficial resemblance of its scolex with that of other gangesiine cestodes.
It should also be noted that, together with Australotaenia de Chambrier & de 
Chambrier, 2010, Pangasiocestus has a particular, intermediate development of the 
uterus (see below), that contrasts that of all other Gangesiinae and Acanthotaeniinae, 
which have a Type 1 development of the uterus. P. romani was found in a catfish in 
Cambodia, and species of Australotaenia are distributed in Australia and Indomalaya, 
which would suggest an Old World origin for proteocephalideans. This scenario is 
consistent with the results of de Chambrier et al. (2004c) and contradicts the hypoth­
esis of Brooks (1978), who favored a South American origin of the group.
The Proteocephalus aggregate and the enigmatic Sandonella and Sciadocephalus
The position of Sandonella Khalil, 1960 as a separate long-branching lineage, as already 
observed by de Chambrier et al. (2008), was confirmed in the present study. Sandonella

formed the sister group to the strongly supported Clade E, which is composed of spe­
cies of the Proteocephalus aggregate (Clade F) that are parasites of teleosts in the Hol­
arctic Region, and monotypic genera Glanitaenia and Paraproteocephalus, which are 
parasites of silurid catfish in the Palearctic Region. The members of the Proteocephalus 
aggregate (= Proteocephalus sensu stricto) will retain the generic name since this clade 
undoubtedly includes P. ambiguus (Dujardin, 1845), the type species of Proteocepha­
lus, as shown by Scholz et al. (2007). The addition of two Proteocephalus species of 
Nearctic origin [P. fluviatilis from centrarchids (Perciformes) and P. pinguis from pikes 
(Esociformes)] to the dataset revealed their affinity with the Proteocephalus aggregate. 
This close phylogenetic relationship of the Palearctic and Nearctic taxa analyzed is in 
accordance with their similar morphology (Freze 1965, Scholz and Hanzelová 1998). 
The diversity of hosts in Clade E is surprising when compared to other subgroups of 
proteocephalideans that generally diversify in discrete groups of catfish. In this case a 
Holactic radiation of these cestodes in multiple groups of fishes has occurred.
Sandonella sandoni was placed in a new genus and subfamily, Sandonellinae, most­
ly because of the characteristic posterior position of its vitellarium, which is unique 
among proteocephalideans and somewhat resembles that of the Cyclophyllidea in be­
ing formed by two compact, yet deeply lobulated postovarian masses near the posterior 
margin of the proglottids (Khalil 1960, see also fig. 6 in de Chambrier et al. 2008). Bâ 
and Marchand (1994) observed the unique structure of S. sandoni spermatozoa (with 
a single axoneme) and de Chambrier et al. (2008) reported its widespread presence in 
Heterotis niloticus (Cuvier, 1829) throughout Africa and described additional origi­
nal morphological characters such as a scolex with a highly modified apical structure 
formed by 4 muscular retractile lappets, a dilated, vesicle-like proximal part of the ex­
ternal sperm duct, a unique morphology of the uterus, and a complex proglottization 
with mixed smaller and larger (wider) proglottids. Despite these peculiarities, as well 
as its derived 28S sequence, the position of S. sandoni as a sister group of Holarctic 
Proteocephalinae was established by de Chambrier et al. (2008) and is not questioned 
by these results. The presence of this relatively derived parasite in a basal fish lineage 
(Osteoglossiformes) is further evidence that the evolution of proteocephalideans does 
not closely match that of their hosts. It should be noted though that the phylogenetic 
position of this taxon has not yet been tested in more global cestode phylogenies (i.e. 
Waeschenbach et al. 2012, Caira et al. 2014).
Sciadocephalus megalodiscus parasitizing Cichla monoculus Agassiz, 1831 (Perci­
formes) in the Neotropical region and described by Diesing (1850) is another enig­
matic taxon. In its redescription Rego et al. (1999) noted several peculiar morpho­
logical features, such as an umbrella-shaped metascolex, a uterus rapidly resolving into 
capsules, and a musculature with numerous isolated longitudinal fibers, and placed the 
species in the Corallobothriinae based on the presence of a metascolex [which is, how­
ever, a homoplastic character (Scholz et al. 2013)] and the medullary position of the 
genital organs. In our initial evaluation, this taxon appeared as the earliest diverging 
lineage of Clade A (see Suppl. material 1: Fig.1) but it has also been identified as one 
of the three least stable taxa in the analysis and had therefore been excluded from fur­

41
ther analyses. Nevertheless, this possible distinct position of the species among proteo­
cephalideans, supported by its combination of peculiar morphological characteristics, 
might justify its future placement in a separate, higher taxonomic group.
African fish proteocephalideans
Our considerably enlarged dataset of fish proteocephalideans from Africa covers most 
of their diversity and includes all genera reported from the Afrotropical Region. It 
revealed that all but one species (the gangesiine Electrotaenia malopteruri – see above) 
from African siluriform fish form a well-supported, relatively basal Clade G. This is one 
of the most important novelties of the present study: species placed in three subfamilies 
are phylogenetically closely related despite important morphological differences. These 
are: i) the Corallobothriinae (two species of Corallobothrium including its type species 
from malapterurid electric catfish) characterized mainly by a well-developed metas­
colex and medullary testes; ii) the Marsypocephalinae (tow species from clariids) with 
a simple scolex and cortical testes; and iii) the Proteocephalinae (three Proteocephalus 
species from clariid, claroteid and mochokid catfish, and Barsonella lafoni de Chambri­
er, Scholz, Beletew & Mariaux, 2009 from Clarias spp.), with a relatively simple scolex 
and medullary testes (de Chambrier et al. 2009b). This grouping of taxa with markedly 
different scoleces as well as conspicuously distinct position of the testes (medullary 
versus cortical) is further evidence that morphological characteristics related to the 
scolex and internal topology of genital organs are homoplastic and should be inter­
preted with great caution. A similar situation was demonstrated in Macrobothriotaenia 
ficta, a snake parasite from Indomalaya, which possesses a tetraphyllidean-like scolex: 
it is closely related to species of Ophiotaenia with a simple scolex (Scholz et al. 2013; 
see also Clade K), but less so with Thaumasioscolex didephidis despite having a very 
similar scolex morphology. The new results also indicate that zoogeography and host 
associations may have played a much more important role in the evolutionary history 
of proteocephalidean cestodes than previously thought (Freze 1965, Rego et al. 1998).
Parasites of the Neotropical pimelodid catfish Phractocephalus hemioliopterus
Neotropical catfish, in particular pimelodids, harbour the highest number of species 
(and genera) of proteocephalidean cestodes. However, these parasites do not form 
a monophyletic assemblage, even though most of them belong to our most derived 
clade with unresolved internal relationships (see also Zehnder and Mariaux 1999, de 
Chambrier et al. 2004c). The current study confirmed the polyphyly of these ces­
todes, including the markedly distant position of three species from the pimelodid 
catfish Phractocephalus hemioliopterus (Clade H) from the remaining cestodes para­
sitizing other siluriforms from South America, as first observed in a much smaller 
dataset by Hypša et al. (2005).

As many as six species reported from P. hemioliopterus were included in our anal­
yses. Three of them, namely Proteocephalus hemioliopteri, Scholzia emarginata (both 
Proteocephalinae) and Zygobothrium megacephalum (Zygobothriinae), differ markedly 
from each other in their scolex morphology (see de Chambrier et al. 2005), yet form a 
well-supported lineage (Clade H) together with Nearctic “corallobothriines” (Clade I). 
Their phylogenetic position is, thus, more basal and distant from that of other proteo­
cephalideans parasitizing Neotropical teleosts.
The remaining three taxa that parasitize P. hemioliopterus, i.e. two species of Pseudo­
crepidobothrium (Proteocephalinae) and Ephedrocephalus microcephalus Diesing, 1850 
(Ephedrocephalinae) group in an unresolved position towards the base of the South 
American radiation. This suggests possible independent colonizations of this host. The 
basal position of these parasites is in accordance with the fact that P. hemioliopterus is 
one of the most ancient pimelodids, as suggested by fossil records dating from Middle 
to Late Miocene (Lundberg and Littmann 2003).
Our data do not enable any reliable assessment regarding a possible host-parasite 
coevolution, especially in the case of pimelodid catfishes and their Neotropical pro­
teocephalideans. A comparison of the interrelationships of the Pimelodidae based on 
robust morphological and molecular evidence (Lundberg et al. 2011 and references 
therein) with the present data does not reveal any obvious pattern of possible co-
evolutionary history. In fact, cestodes from closely related pimelodids such as species 
of Pseudoplatystoma Bleeker, 1862 and Sorubimichthys planiceps (Spix & Agassiz, 1829) 
are unrelated and belong to distant lineages (Table 1 and Fig. 1a, b).
Nearctic “corallobothriines” from channel catfishes (Ictaluridae)
Nearctic species from channel catfish form a well-supported, monophyletic lineage 
(Clade I) composed of species of three genera, Essexiella Scholz, de Chambrier, Mar­
iaux & Kuchta, 2011, Megathylacoides and Corallotaenia Freze, 1965. However, the 
Nearctic genera, conventionally placed in the Corallobothriinae because they possess 
a metascolex, are not closely related to the monotypic Corallobothrium from the elec­
tric catfish, Malapterurus electricus Gmelin, 1789, in Africa and their morphological 
resemblance is probably a result of convergent evolution (Scholz et al. 2011). In fact, 
the subfamily Corallobothriinae groups species of unrelated genera (African Coral­
lobothrium in Clade G, three Nearctic genera in Clade I, Japanese Paraproteocephalus 
in Clade E and Neotropical Megathylacus Woodland, 1934 in Clade D – Fig. 1a, b) 
that share apparently homoplasious morphological characteristics, i.e. a well-developed 
metascolex and a medullary position of genital organs as described above (Freze 1965, 
Rego 1994, Rosas-Valdez et al. 2004).
As a consequence, a new taxon should be proposed to accommodate Nearctic 
channel catfish proteocephalideans, which are apparently unrelated either to the true 
corallobothriines (in fact now represented by C. solidum and a species to be described, 
both from Africa) or to the various other proteocephalideans from freshwater teleosts

in North America that are distributed throughout the phylogenetic tree (Clades F and 
D – see Fig. 1a, b). Similarly, the position of Paraproteocephalus within the Corallo­
bothriinae will need to be reconsidered. This placement is likely to be due to conver­
gences in scolex shape, and the genus should be placed in the Proteocephaliinae.
Cosmopolitan reptilian proteocephalideans
The distribution of proteocephalideans in snakes is particularly interesting. Multiple 
colonizations of reptiles, as already suggested by de Chambrier et al. (2004c), are confir­
med here and at least three main events (see Clades K, N and O) are shown in this study 
(besides the case of Australotaenia). In each case, cestodes of snakes appear to be related 
to various proteocephalideans of Neotropical catfishes and other teleosts (Fig. 1a, b). 
The most interesting novel insight from our study in this context is the strong support 
found for Clade K, composed almost exclusively of parasites from snakes (Viperidae, 
Elapidae, Lamprophiidae and Xenopeltidae) throughout the world (with the exception 
of Palearctic) and the unique switch to a mammalian host (Didelphidis marsupialis L., 
1758) in the northernmost Neotropical Region in the case of Thaumasioscolex didelphi­
dis. Colubridae are notably absent from this host list. This grouping of rather derived 
snake parasites cannot be unambiguously explained by our data and may either be the 
sign of a relatively recent colonization of unrelated groups in all continents or a trace 
of a very ancient colonization of snakes. Even though all these species belong to the 
Proteocephalinae because of the medullary position of their genital organs and the ab­
sence of a metascolex, they actually differ markedly from each other, especially in their 
scolex morphology, and were placed in three separate genera (Freze 1965, de Cham­
brier 1989a, de Chambrier 1989b, Rego 1994, Cañeda-Guzmán et al. 2001, Scholz 
et al. 2013). Two of these (Macrobothriotaenia Freze, 1965 and Thaumasioscolex) are 
essentially characterized by peculiar scoleces. The position of Crepidobothrium gerrardii 
(Monticelli, 1900), a parasite of Boidae that is also characterized by a distinctive scolex, 
is not fully resolved but is possibly unrelated to this radiation.
Species of Ophiotaenia in colubrids from Holarctic (2 species – Clade O), Neotro­
pical dipsadids (2 species – Clade N), and Nearctic amphibians are possibly unrelated 
and appear within a polytomy composed of numerous lineages of Neotropical fish 
proteocephalideans. They are morphologically uniform and do not differ significantly 
from the other species of Ophiotaenia in Clade K, as all of them have a similar scolex 
and strobilar morphology, including relative ovary size (see de Chambrier et al. 2012 
and Table 1). However, members of the larger radiation (Clade K) have a Type 1 
uterus whereas those in the other clades have a Type 2 uterus. Consequently, and as 
suspected (Ammann and de Chambrier 2008), it is clear that Ophiotaenia is a com­
posite genus and this name should be restricted to species of Clade O, which includes 
the type species Ophiotaenia perspicua La Rue, 1911 from Neartic colubrids. Species 
in Clade O have proportionally larger ovaries than those in the remaining species of 
“Ophiotaenia” (Clades K, N), which will need to be allocated to other (new) genera.

“Neotropical fish” superclade
In addition to the above-mentioned “reptilian” lineages, our derived Clade B is com­
posed of a number of Neotropical parasites of catfishes and a few other teleosts, where 
the highest species richness can be found in the Pimelodidae (Siluriformes) (de Cham­
brier and Vaucher 1999, Rego et al. 1999). A few parasites from amphibians and turt­
les, as well as Proteocephalus perplexus La Rue, 1911 from bowfin (Amia calva L., 1766), 
also belong to this large polytomy. de Chambrier et al. (2009a) showed that Testudo­
taenia Freze, 1965 of the monotypic subfamily Testudotaeniinae was part of a North 
American clade of proteocephalid parasites of fishes despite its distinctive morphology. 
These results do not contradict this hypothesis although Testudotaenia’s closest relatives 
cannot be inferred from the present tree.
Despite our enlarged sample size, the present study did not resolve the relation­
ships of most Neotropical proteocephalideans from teleosts, and in this respect does not 
significantly improve the results of Zehnder and Mariaux (1999), de Chambrier et al. 
(2004c) or Hypša et al. (2005). Still, some nodes are now well supported, e.g., species 
of Brooksiella Rego, Chubb & Pavanelli, 1999, Rudolphiella and Cangatiella Pavanelli 
& Machado dos Santos, 1991 (Clade J), species of Travassiella Rego & Pavanelli, 1987, 
Houssayela Rego, 1987 and two species of “Proteocephalus” (Clade L), and three species 
of the largely polyphyletic Nomimoscolex, including N. piraeeba (type species), together 
with Jauella glandicephalus (Clade M). However, these well-supported lineages are com­
posed of species with dissimilar morphologies and often belong to different subfamilies 
(as many as three in Clade J). In addition, they parasitize fish of different genera, fami­
lies or even orders, which makes it impossible to define them logically for now.
Other molecular markers, possibly large mtDNA fragments, as used by Waeschen­
bach et al. (2012), are obviously needed if the internal phylogenetic structure of the 
derived Clade B is to be unravelled, although the possibility that this node represents 
a hard-polytomy should also be considered. A similar situation, i.e. support for some 
of the internal nodes but a lack of support for the major lineages, was observed for the 
Caryophyllidea, another order of fish tapeworms, despite the use of several nuclear and 
mitochondrial markers. These commonly employed molecular markers did not contain 
sufficient phylogenetic signal due to substitution saturation (Brabec et al. 2012).
Catfishes (order Siluriformes) represent one of the key host groups for proteocephal­
idean cestodes, but there is no obvious coevolutionary pattern between them. This lack of 
closer host-associations at a higher taxonomic level is not surprising because catfishes form 
an extraordinarily diverse group of teleosts with over 3,000 valid recognized species (Es­
chmeyer et al. 2004). The interrelationships of large groups in the Siluroidei, which com­
prises almost all catfish hosts of proteocephalideans, including the Neotropical pimelodids 
and heptapterids (Pimelodoidea) and African taxa (“Big Africa” clade with cestode-hosting 
families Mochokidae, Malapteruridae, and Auchenoglanidae and phylogenetically distant 
Clariidae) are poorly resolved (Sullivan et al. 2006). Molecular data suggest an ancient si­
luriform presence, if not origin, in South America, but phylogenies inferred from rag gene 
sequences did not identify any African-South American catfish clade (Sullivan et al. 2006).

Monophyly/polyphyly of proteocephalidean genera
Even though 10 genera (see above) appeared to form monophyletic assemblages, all 
but one (Proteocephalus aggregate) were represented by a very low number of species 
(2–3), and the validity of some of them may still have to be reconsidered when a denser 
sampling is available. In contrast, all species-rich genera with at least nine species ana­
lyzed (Nomimoscolex, Ophiotaenia and Proteocephalus sensu lato), as well as Amphotero­
morphus (4 species), appeared to be polyphyletic and are distributed across numerous 
lineages, even though their morphology and host-associations are quite similar.
A situation comparable to that of Proteocephalus (species of this genus belong to 
at least 7 distinct lineages – Fig. 1a, b) starts to emerge in Nomimoscolex. As previ­
ously noted by Zehnder et al. (2000), our Nomimoscolex samples are distributed across 
several distinct lineages in Clade D. The type species N. piraeeba, belonging to the 
well-supported Clade M, and all Nomimoscolex loosely grouped across other lineages 
in Clade D will ultimately have to be placed in other genera. At this point, however, 
objective morphological characters are still lacking to recognize these worms.
This work also confirms the polyphyly of Monticellia La Rue, 1911 in its present 
form with M. spinulifera Woodland, 1935 and M. lenha Woodland, 1933 found in 
siluriforms forming well-supported Clade P, which is distantly related to the type spe­
cies of the genus, M. coryphicephala (Monticelli, 1891) from characids. The two former 
species belong to Monticellia since de Chambrier and Vaucher (1999) synonymised 
Spasskyellina Freze, 1965 with Monticellia. Spasskyellina was later considered as valid 
by de Chambrier et al. (2006), without considering the 1999 work, thus generating 
confusion about the status of the genus. Given the obvious morphological support that 
confirms our molecular results, we propose splitting Monticellia in order to reflect this 
situation and to formally resurrect here the genus Spasskyellina, that was erected in 1965 
by Freze (Freze 1965) for those taxa possessing gladiate spinitriches (de Chambrier and 
Scholz 2008, Chervy 2009) on margins of their suckers, i.e. Spasskyellina lenha (Wood­
land, 1933) Freze, 1965 (type species) and Spasskyellina spinulifera (Woodland, 1935a) 
Freze, 1965. They are presented under this name in Fig. 1b. Additionally, Spasskyellina 
mandi Pavanelli & Takemoto, 1996 is confirmed in this revalidated genus because of its 
obviously similar morphology, contrary to previous observations (Pavanelli and Take­
moto 1996, de Chambrier and Vaucher 1999). Since molecular data for other species 
of Monticellia are not available, they are provisionally kept in that genus.
Evolution of morphological characters
Regarding the evolution of morphological characters, the most obvious and evolution­
arily important observation derived from Fig.1a, b is the presence of a rostellar appara­
tus with retractor muscles in all the basal taxa. Such structures (Fig. 3A–C), although 
with some variation, are characteristic of all Acanthotaeniinae and Gangesiinae and are 
lost in all more derived Proteocephalidae (Clade A) without exception. Although apical

structures are present in some other members of the order such as in the Proteocephalus 
aggregate from the Holarctic (see Scholz et al. 1998), P. sophiae de Chambrier & Rego, 
1994 from South America, P. glanduligerus (Janicki, 1928) from Africa, Jauella Rego 
& Pavanelli, 1985 or Nomimoscolex sensu stricto as defined by Zehnder et al. (2000) 
(Clade M), these are very different, especially because they lack a supporting muscu­
lar apparatus (retractors) (de Chambrier and Rego 1994, de Chambrier and Vaucher 
1999, Scholz et al. 2009). This kind of functional simplification, in this case due to 
the loss of apical attachment structures, is known from other cestode groups and has 
appeared repeatedly, for example in a number of derived cyclophyllidean genera (Jones 
et al. 1994), even though these structures are unlikely to be homologous.
The development of the uterus seems to represent one of the key features that re­
flects the evolution of proteocephalideans and characterizes their major lineages. The 
evolution of uterine structure as described in de Chambrier et al. (2004c) is essentially 
supported in the present analysis although with some added complexity. Both putative 
acquisitions of Type 2 uterine development observed by these authors are observed in 
our extended analysis (see red circles in Clade E and D) but the inclusion of new taxa 
revealed a third instance of transition of this character in Clade I in a well-supported 
group of Nearctic Corallobothriinae. Furthermore, the situation for taxa belonging to 
Clade L is unclear with two of them harbouring a Type 2 uterus, one a Type 1 uterus 
(Travassiella jandia) and one with missing information (gravid proglottids of Proteo­
cephalus kuyukuyu have never been found).
Two basal taxa belonging to Acanthotaeniinae and Gangesiinae show a different, 
as yet undescribed, form of uterus development that we call “intermediate type” (see 
purple circles on Fig. 1a). This development differs from Type 1 development by the 
presence of chromophilic cells at points of origin of the lateral extensions of the uterus 
before the lateral stems are visible. It differs from Type 2 development in an early 
appearance of the main tubular uterus axis (Fig. 2). Assuming that the “intermediate 
type” might be a transitional stage between both uterus development types, a possible 
interpretation of this observation would be that a general trend toward the acquisition 
of Type 2 uterus development exists throughout the proteocephalidean diversity.
New morphological characters that are potentially useful for proteocephalidean 
taxonomy are notoriously difficult to define. However, Ammann and de Chambrier 
(2008) observed differences in the relative surface area of the ovary in relation to the 
total surface of the proglottids (see Fig. 3G–H). In their study, this ratio was on average 
five times lower in 27 species of Ophiotaenia from snakes in the New World compared 
to Palearctic members of the Proteocephalus aggregate from teleosts. More recently, 
de Chambrier et al. (2012) compared 66 of the nominal species of Ophiotaenia from 
Old and New World reptilian hosts with 69 species of Proteocephalus from freshwater 
teleosts. They noted that the ovaries of species parasitic in non-Palearctic snakes are 
proportionally smaller than those in species of Proteocephalus parasitic in teleost fishes 
from all over the world and also considerably smaller than that of congeneric species 
from European hosts.

In the present study, data on the relative size of the ovary are provided for all taxa 
analyzed (see Table 1). Results from two former studies (Ammann and de Chambrier 
2008, de Chambrier et al. 2012) are verified here in the context of a larger dataset 
covering more genera and subfamilies. We can conclude that the ratio of the ovary 
surface to the proglottid surface in mature proglottids largely corresponds to major 
host groups and thus represents a promising character of possible phylogenetic im­
portance that should be routinely reported in future descriptions or redescriptions of 
proteocephalidean taxa (for methodology of taking this ratio – see de Chambrier et al. 
2012). However, patterns in the relative size of the ovary of species from different host 
groups discussed above are not universal and notable exceptions exist. For example, the 
smallest known ovary is found in Margaritaella gracilis Arredondo & Gil de Pertierra, 
2012 from the catfish Callichthys callichthys (L., 1758) (ratio of 0.6–1.8%; Arredondo 
and Gil de Pertierra 2012) and not in a species from snakes.
Characters related to eggs and their morphology have been shown to be impor­
tant in the systematics of proteocephalidean cestodes (Gil de Pertierra and de Cham­
brier 2000, Scholz and de Chambrier 2003, de Chambrier et al. 2005, de Chambrier 
2006, de Chambrier and de Chambrier 2010, Scholz et al. 2011) but have generally 
been underexploited and remain poorly known for many species. Here, they allow the 
characterization of a well-supported node grouping species of Rudolphiella, Brooksiella 
and Cangatiella (Clade J), because all these taxa possess very typical eggs with polar 
extensions (Fig. 3E, F). To our knowledge, no other proteocephalidean shows such 
egg characteristics and thus the presence of polar extensions can be considered as a 
synapomorphy that defines this group. Furthermore, species in these genera all present 
a ventral vitellarium and Brooksiella and all species of Rudolphiella (but not Canga­
tiella) have a folliculate ovary and a metascolex (Gil de Pertierra and Viozzi 1999, de 
Chambrier et al. 2004b). These morphological characteristics seem to strongly support 
this clade.
Another kind of egg (in capsules) (Fig. 3D) is found in the basal Australasian Ka­
psulotaenia parasites of varanids and is also known in Vandiermenia de Chambrier & 
de Chambrier, 2010 and some “Ophiotaenia” of Australian snakes. In the Neotropics 
a similar evolution of eggs (in groups of 4–6) is known in Thaumasioscolex, the sin­
gle known proteocephalidean of marsupials. The phylogenetic value of this character 
remains presently doubtful as some of these worms belong to isolated clades (Scholz 
et al. 2013). It may however represent an interesting convergent adaption in proteo­
cephalidean with terrestrial life cycle, although it curiously did not seem to have ap­
peared outside of the Autralasian (and maybe Neotropical) region despite the presence 
of terrestrial proteocephalideans in other areas.
Unfortunately, most lineages revealed in the present study lack such obvious syna­
pomorphies due to a high degree of homoplasy across numerous morphological char­
acters previously used for distinguishing individual genera and subfamilies, such as 
scolex morphology and the position of reproductive organs in relation to the inner 
longitudinal musculature (Rego 1994, 1999). Thus, the delineation of many taxono­
mic groups using morphological features remains currently impossible.

Conclusions
This study is based on the most representative molecular dataset of proteocephalid­
ean taxa ever sampled (33% of all valid species, almost 80% of genera and all extant 
subfamilies). However, some groups are still under-represented, mainly because of the 
difficulties in obtaining fresh samples, either due to their low prevalence and the pro­
tection or rare occurrence of their hosts. Probably the most serious gap in our dataset 
is the small number (two species) of proteocephalideans parasitizing amphibians (frogs 
and salamanders). These are usually extremely rare, with less than 1% of host infected 
(de Chambrier et al. 2006, Marsella and de Chambrier 2008). Similarly, none of the 
four species of Ophiotaenia from lizards (excluding Varanus spp.) were available for this 
analysis. In contrast, our geographical coverage was rather comprehensive thanks to the 
intensive sampling effort during the last decades. This considerably enlarged dataset 
has helped to better characterize several lineages, but the relationships of many taxa, 
especially those in the most derived Clade B, largely comprising parasites of catfishes in 
the Neotropical Region, remain largely unresolved.
The evolutionary history of the order has been apparently much more complicated 
than one would expect, considering a relatively small number (about 315) of extant 
species. Although we did not formally examine the host-parasite coevolution of pro­
teocephalideans here, our tree strongly suggests the occurrence of several colonization 
events of poikilothermic vertebrates as well as repeated colonization of the principal 
zoogeographical regions with the most recent, and probably explosive, radiation in 
Neotropical teleosts, especially pimelodid catfishes.
Based on 28S rDNA sequences, these results support several new insights into the 
evolution of proteocephalideans. Unfortunately, they also cast a number of doubts on 
our present understanding of the classifications within this group: most recognized 
subfamily-level taxa are, at best, only partially supported. A notable consequence is that 
scolex morphology and the position of internal organs (testes, uterus and vitelline fol­
licles in relation to the inner longitudinal musculature) should be considered with cau­
tion when used for higher-level taxonomy, i.e. to distinguish genera and subfamilies. 
Clearly a complete taxonomical reorganization of the order is needed. This will likely 
include the designation of a number of well-supported families and the removal of the 
subfamilial terminology. Any formal reorganization of the order, however, would be 
premature as long as a more complete multigene analysis remains to be performed. At 
lower taxonomical levels, we nevertheless propose resurrecting the genus Spasskyellina 
for three species of Monticellia (see above) but, for now, we consider that further no­
menclatural adaptations should be delayed until clearly supported groups, reinforced 
by well-defined morphological characters, can be named and adequately characterized.
Results reported herein make it obvious that a new classification should not be 
based on the characters traditionally used for circumscribing genera and families (Rego 
1994). Instead, new synapomorphies should be found to distinguish morphologically 
similar, but genetically distinct lineages, and to propose a more natural classification 
that would better reflect the evolutionary history of proteocephalideans. If applied, this

would represent a clear change of strategy in our attempts to understand the evolution 
of the group. In practice, this could lead to the erection of numerous small genera con­
sisting of a few species each and sharing only a few morphological, possibly discrete, 
synapomorphies but with good molecular support. A careful move in that direction 
might be the future of the systematics and taxonomy of proteocephalideans.

Data type: Phylogenetic tree
Explanation note: Bayesian inference of partial (domains 1–3) 28S rDNA sequences 
of the complete taxon set of proteocephalideans performed using MrBayes version 
3.1 using the GTR + I + G model of sequence evolution. Two parallel runs were 
performed for 10,000,000 generations; 8,000,000 generations were discarded as 
burnin. Branches with posterior probability (pp) support below 95% are collapsed; 
pp are indicated below branches.

Data type: Leaf stability test results
Explanation note: Leaf stability test results from the post-burnin posterior tree distri­
bution from two MrBayes runs that included the full complement of taxa. Taxa are 
ranked based on their positional stability estimated from the Maximum, which is 
an average of all the highest percentages from all possible quartet sets for a particu­
lar taxon, Difference, which is the difference between the highest and the second 
highest percentages from all possible quartet sets for a particular taxon, and Entro­
py, which is calculated as the normalized sum of logs for each quartet percentages 
(except the unresolved polygamy).
