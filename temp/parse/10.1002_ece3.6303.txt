Abstract
Polyploidy can cause variation in plant functional traits and thereby generate indi-
viduals that can adapt to fluctuating environments and exploit new environments. 
However, few empirical studies have tested for an association between ploidy level 
and climatic tolerance of invasive cytotypes relative to conspecific native-range cy-
totypes. Here, we used an invasive plant Solidago canadensis to test whether invasive 
populations had a higher proportion of polyploids, greater height and stem-base di-
ameter, and occupied a wider range of climatic conditions than conspecific native-
range populations. We also tested whether the invasive populations had overcome 
genetic founder effects. We sampled a total of 80 populations in parts of the invaded 
range in China and native range in North America for in situ measurements of plant 
height and stem-base diameter in the field and for population genetic and cytotype 
analyses. To examine climatic correlates, we augmented our field-sampled data with 
occurrence records obtained from Global Biodiversity Information Facility. All, except 
one, of the populations that we sampled in China occurred in a humid subtropical cli-
mate. In contrast, the North American populations occurred in humid continental, 
humid subtropical, and semi-arid climatic zones. All populations of S. canadensis in 
China were purely hexaploid, while the North American populations were diploid, 
tetraploid, and hexaploid. The invasive hexaploids were significantly taller and had 
a larger stem-base diameter than native hexaploids. Native hexaploids were signifi-
cantly taller and had larger stem-base diameter than native diploids. Climatic cor-
relate assessment found that invasive and native populations occupied different 
climatic envelopes, with invasive populations occurring in warmer and less seasonal 
climates than native populations. However, there was no significant correlation be-
tween ploidy level and climatic envelope of S. canadensis. Molecular phylogeography 
data suggest reduced genetic founder effects in the invaded range. Overall, these 
results suggest that polyploidy does not influence S. canadensis climatic tolerance.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Invasions by exotic plant species pose substantial threats to native 
biodiversity and alter ecosystem processes across a broad range of 
environments (McGeoch et al., 2010; Pyšek et al., 2012). To improve 
effectiveness of invasive plant management, it is necessary to under-
stand the mechanisms that underpin invasive spread of exotic plants 
(Dawson, Burslem, & Hulme, 2009). Species with high variation in 
functional traits (morphological, physiological, and phenological) 
can adapt to different stress levels and increase the uptake of lim-
iting resources across a broad range of climatic conditions (Nicotra 
et al., 2010). Thus, plants that possess higher mean values of, and 
variation in, functional traits in the invaded ranges than in their na-
tive ranges may have an enhanced capacity to colonize a wide range 
of climatic conditions (Pyšek et al., 2012; Richardson & Pyšek, 2006). 
Therefore, an understanding of the factors that determine variation 
in functional trait values in invasive plants is key to predicting inva-
sion risks (Leffler, James, Monaco, & Sheley, 2014; te Beest, Esler, & 
Richardson, 2015).
Polyploidy (i.e., whole genome duplication) can cause variation 
in plant morphology, phenology, and physiology and thereby gen-
erate individuals that can adapt to fluctuating environments, exploit 
new environments, or outcompete progenitor diploids (te Beest 
et al., 2012; Simón-Porcar, Silva, Meeus, Higgins, & Vallejo-Marín, 
2017; Soltis, Visger, & Soltis, 2014). Therefore, polyploidy may con-
fer plants with novel features that allow them to invade new envi-
ronments or expand their ecological ranges (Parisod, Holderegger, & 
Brochmann, 2010; Thébault, Gillet, Müller-Schärer, & Buttler, 2011; 
te Beest et  al.,  2015). Several studies have found invasive plant 
species to have higher ploidy levels in the introduced ranges than 
in their native ranges. For instance, this has been reported for in-
vasions by Centaurea maculosa (Muller,  1989; Treier et  al.,  2009), 
Lythrum salicaria (Kubatova et al.,  2008), and Centaurea stoebe in 
North America (Mráz, Tarbush, & Müller-Schärer,  2014); Solidago 
gigantea (Schlaepfer, Edwards, & Billeter, 2010) and Senecio inaequi-
dens in Europe (Monty, Maurice, & Mahy, 2010); Solidago canadensis 
in China (Li, Liu, Yan, & Du, 2017); and Lilium lancifolium in Europe 
and North America (Chung et  al.,  2015). However, few empirical 
studies have tested for an association between variation in ploidy 
level and climatic tolerance of invasive plants in their introduced and 
native ranges (Broennimann, Mráz, Petitpierre, Guisan, & Müller-
Schärer,  2014; Treier et  al.,  2009). A case study on C. maculosa 
found that invasive-range tetraploid populations occupied a drier 
climate than conspecific native-range tetraploid populations (Treier 
et al., 2009). Nevertheless, later experimental results suggested that 
drought tolerance did not differ between C. maculosa cytotypes, 
but was instead correlated with original latitudinal clines within 
cytotypes (Mráz et al., 2014). The paucity of studies that integrate 
cytobiogeography with evaluation of climatic tolerance pre-empts 
drawing a firm conclusion as to whether higher ploidy levels confer 
wider climatic tolerance.
It also remains unresolved whether a pronounced shift in cyto-
type distribution that has been reported in several invasive plant 
species is due to stochastic genetic founder events or adaptive evo-
lutionary processes. Population genetic theory predicts that inva-
sive species are likely to experience genetic founder effects, which 
may reduce their ability to adapt to novel environmental conditions 
(Dlugosch & Parker, 2008). Founder effects can cause a reduction 
in genetic diversity because the introduced populations are often a 
subset of the original, larger populations (Dlugosch & Parker, 2008). 
Nevertheless, studies have found evidence for local adaptation in 
several invasive species (Oduor, Leimu, & Kleunen,  2016), which 
implies that the species have overcome genetic founder effects. 
Invasive species may overcome (or at least minimize) founder ef-
fects through multiple introduction events (i.e., introductions of 
diverse genetic lineages from different source populations in the 
native range) or a single introduction event from a native-range 
source population having high genetic variation (Genton, Shykoff, & 
Giraud, 2005; Le Roux et al., 2011; Meyerson & Cronin, 2013; Oduor 
et al., 2015). However, few studies have used cytobiogeographical 
and molecular phylogeographical approaches to determine whether 
invasive cytotypes represent a full complement of genetic diversity 
that occurs in the native range.
Here, we used the invasive plant S. canadensis to test a predic-
tion that polyploidy can enable invasive plant species to colonize a 
wider range of climatic conditions. Specifically, we combined a cyto-
biogeographical approach, estimates of functional traits and climatic 
correlates, and molecular phylogeography methods to test whether 
invasive populations of S. canadensis: 1) had a higher proportion of 
polyploids, 2) were larger, 3) had a wider climatic tolerance, and 4) 
had overcome founder effects, relative to native populations of S. 
canadensis.
2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 | Study species
Solidago canadensis L. (Asteraceae) is a rhizomatous clonal peren-
nial forb native to North America and has invaded China and other 
regions (Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan) (Abhilasha, 
Quintana, Vivanco, & Joshi, 2008; Jin, Yuan, Gao, Oduor, & Li, 2020; 
Xu & Qiang,  2011). Solidago canadensis reproduces both clonally 
and sexually (Li et al., 2017). The plant is self-incompatible and pro-
duces small wind-dispersed seeds for long-distance dispersal (Li 
et al., 2017). However, the plant can spread clonally at a local scale (Li 
et al., 2017). In China, S. canadensis was first introduced to Zhejiang, 
Jiangsu, and Shanghai provinces in the early 1930s as an ornamental 
garden species (Xu et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2015). It escaped from 
cultivation and experienced explosive spread across eastern China 
after 1980s, and is now distributed widely across eastern China 
where it abounds in disturbed habitats, including agricultural lands, 
roadsides, railways, and city suburbs (Dong, Yu, & He, 2015; Zhao 
et al., 2015). The species has diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid cy-
totypes in the native range, but only hexaploids have been found 
in China (Li et  al.,  2017). Previous studies (Xu et  al.,  2012; Zhao 
 20457758, 2020, 12, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.6303, Wiley Online Library on [31/03/2025].

WAN et al.
et  al.,  2015) suggest that the Chinese populations were founded 
through multiple introduction events.
2.2 | Sampling and functional trait measurement
To identify occurrence locations of S. canadensis in China and North 
America, we conducted field surveys in summer and autumn for the 
period 2013–2016. We sampled a total of 2,051 S. canadensis indi-
viduals in 19 native and 61 invasive populations. The number of in-
dividuals sampled per population ranged from five to 33. The native 
range in North America was represented by 577 individuals, while 
the invaded range in China was represented by 1,474 individuals 
(Appendix 1). Any two sample populations were at least 5 km apart. 
In each population, we sampled at random plants that occurred 
within a radius of 10–20 m to minimize a potential bias due to envi-
ronmental heterogeneity within a population (e.g., soil moisture and 
nutrients). To avoid sampling plants from the same genet within the 
same radius, we sampled plants that were at least two meters apart 
from each other. For each S. canadensis individual, we took in situ 
measurements of stem-base diameter and plant height (in cm). These 
functional traits are generally linked to ecological strategy axes of 
plants. As a plant developmental stage (i.e., phenophase) can influ-
ence the values of these traits, we took measurements only from 
mature plants that had set seeds and were therefore presumably not 
undergoing further development in height and stem diameter. We 
omitted leaf measurements because an individual S. canadensis plant 
can have hundreds of leaves (especially in the non-native range), and 
hence, finding the largest leaf for measurement can be extremely 
difficult. In the native range, the ecological niches of S. canadensis 
and those of its congeners S. gigantea and S. altissima overlap and 
the three species can coexist (Benelli et  al.,  2019; Weber,  1998). 
However, S. canadensis prefers loose and drier soils than the con-
geners, and hence, it occurs mostly near urban areas, roadsides, and 
railways, while the congeners occur mainly on riverside and embank-
ments (Benelli et al., 2019). Therefore, within a locality, we sampled 
only the preferred habitats of S. canadensis to avoid accidental sam-
pling of the congeners. Moreover, we conducted a test of phyloge-
netic relatedness among the populations that we sampled in the field 
to determine whether they all belonged to S. canadensis (see the sec-
tion on population genetics and phylogenetic analyses below). All 
the sampled populations in China occurred in a humid subtropical 
climate except one that occurred in a subtropical highland climate. 
In contrast, the North American populations were sampled from 
humid continental, humid subtropical, and semi-arid climatic zones 
(Köppen–Geiger climate classification system) (Kottek, Grieser, 
Beck, Rudolf, & Rube, 2006).
2.3 | Determination of ploidy level
We took fresh leaf samples from the same S. canadensis individuals 
used for functional trait measurements described above. The leaf 
materials were held in self-sealing plastic bags containing silica and 
transported to the laboratory for ploidy level determination. We 
applied a modified flow cytometry method by Suda and Trávníček 
(2006) in the determination of ploidy level. In brief, 20 mg of silica-
dried leaf tissue was chopped up with a razor blade in 1 ml of ice-
cold extraction buffer (20 mM MOPS, 45 mM MgCl2, 30 mM sodium 
citrate, 0.1% v/v Triton X-100, 0.5% w/v polyvinylpyrrolidone) in a 
plastic Petri dish held on a chilled brick. A new razor blade was used 
for each leaf sample. The resultant fine slurry was filtered through a 
600-mesh nylon filter (Shanghai Aoran Hardware Market, Shanghai, 
China). The filtrate was held in a new 5-ml centrifuge tube. The fil-
tered slurry was then resuspended in a pre-cooled 1 ml of extraction 
buffer in a Petri dish and then filtered again. The final filtrate was 
treated with 10 μL/ml of RNase A for 10 min at 4°C. Then, 200 μL/
ml of a propidium iodide (PI) staining solution was added and incu-
bated at 4°C for 30 min in darkness. The fluorescence strength of PI-
DNA conjugates was measured on Attune® NxT Acoustic Focusing 
Flow Cytometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Waltham, MA, USA) 
using a 488 nm laser and 590/40 emission filter. Leaf of the hexa-
ploid S. canadensis (confirmed by cytometry and karyotype analysis) 
collected in Taizhou City, Zhejiang Province, China, was used as an 
external reference.
2.4 | Statistical analyses
To test whether S. canadensis plants from the invaded range had sig-
nificantly greater height and stem-base diameter than S. canadensis 
plants from the native range, we fitted linear mixed-effect models. 
In the models, a trait value was treated as a dependent variable, 
while S. canadensis range (invaded vs. native) was treated as a fixed-
effect independent variable. Population identity of S. canadensis was 
treated as a random-effect factor and nested within range. To test 
whether polyploidy in general conferred higher mean trait values, 
we also fitted linear mixed-effect models to test whether the func-
tional trait values differed between hexaploid and diploid individu-
als in the native range. Because only hexaploids were found in the 
invaded range, this latter test was not possible for invasive plants. 
In the test, ploidy level (polyploid vs. diploid) was treated as a fixed-
effect independent variable, while S. canadensis population identity 
was treated as a random-effect independent variable. We did ad-
ditional analyses to test for the potential confounding effect of cli-
mate on trait expression by comparing traits of invasive plants with 
those of native plants from the same climatic zone only. As nearly 
all invasive plants were sampled in a humid subtropical climate, we 
used a subset of plants from this climatic zone only. We did sepa-
rate comparisons for groups of plants that occurred in populations 
with mixed-ploidy and for groups of plants that occurred in popula-
tions with one ploidy type. Moreover, we compared traits of diploid 
plants with those of hexaploid plants that occurred in mixed-ploidy 
populations only to exclude the potential confounding effect of pure 
and mixed-ploidy populations occupying habitats with contrast-
ing ecological conditions. In all the analyses, we fitted the models

using maximum likelihood with the lme function in the nlme pack-
age (Pinheiro, Bates, DebRoy, & Sarkar, 2007) in r v 3.5.2 (R Core 
Team, 2018). We used likelihood ratio tests to assess the significance 
of each factor by comparing a model without the factor with a full 
model.
2.5 | Assessing climatic tolerance
We described the climatic space occupied by S. canadensis with 
19 variables with a 30 arc-sec resolution (~1  km) derived from 
the WorldClim database (Hijmans, Cameron, Parra, Jones, & 
Jarvis, 2005). After standardization of the climatic variables (mean 
equal to zero and standard deviation equal to 1), we reduced the 
dimensionality of the climatic hyperspace to two axes (PC1 and PC2) 
based on a PCA (Broennimann et al., 2012). In addition to our 80 
field-sampled records of S. canadensis in China and North America, 
we collected information on occurrences of S. canadensis provided 
by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) database 
(http://www.gbif.org/) in order to assess more comprehensively the 
climatic tolerance of the species. We retained only the GBIF occur-
rence records in the native (United States, Canada, and Mexico) and 
invaded (Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and China) ranges where 
the species is most widespread. Occurrences flagged as invalid (e.g., 
in the oceans) or with doubtful coordinates were removed as well 
as those separated by less than 30 arc-seconds to avoid pseudo-
replication. We then extracted values of PC1 and PC2 for each of 
the 2,214 retained occurrence locations (i.e., our 80 field-sampled 
records and 2,134 GBIF records, which included 1,624 records in the 
native range and 510 records in the invaded range).
To test whether climatic space occupied by S. canadensis differed 
significantly between the invaded and native ranges, we calculated 
the kernel-smoothed density of occurrence of the two ranges based 
on the density of the different combinations of climatic conditions 
available to each range (Broennimann et al., 2012). The overlap be-
tween the climatic envelope of the two ranges was estimated with 
the Schoener's D metric, which ranges from 0 (no envelope overlap) 
to 1 (identical envelopes) (Schoener, 1968). We then tested for en-
velope equivalency and the less restrictive hypothesis of envelope 
similarity (comparing the observed values of envelope overlap to 
the 95th percentile density of the simulated values) (Warren, Glor, & 
Turelli, 2008). To achieve this, the D value between the two ranges 
was compared to a null distribution of D values computed between 
simulated envelopes built through randomization procedures (10,000 
randomly selected “background” points generated 100 times). This 
was computed with the r package “ecospat” (Di Cola et al., 2017). 
As a D value does not allow a determination of whether an absence 
of envelope overlap results from the lack of overlap for one or two 
PCA axes, we used the function “niceOverPlot” implemented in R for 
easier interpretation. To test whether S. canadensis inhabited a wider 
range of climatic conditions in its invaded range than in the native 
range, we performed an F-test of equality of variances (homoscedas-
ticity) along the two PCA axes. We also used the same method to 
compare the climatic zones occupied by diploid and hexaploid pop-
ulations of S. canadensis in its native range. Finally, we compared D 
values and envelope equivalencies and similarities between the fol-
lowing groups of S. canadensis populations: 1) North American versus 
Chinese populations that we had sampled in the field and with the 
same ploidy level, 2) North American versus Chinese populations that 
we had sampled in the field and without controlling for variation in 
ploidy level, 3) a global data set (i.e., the 80 populations that we had 
sampled in the field and GBIF records) of North America and Mexico 
grouped together versus China, and 4) a global data set of North 
America and Mexico grouped together versus all occurrence records 
in Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and China. Comparisons 1 and 2 
tested the potential effect of variation in ploidy, while comparisons 
3 and 4 tested whether our sampling was representative of the in-
vaded and native ranges. For comparisons 3 and 4, it was not possible 
to control for variation in ploidy level because information on ploidy 
level was missing in the GBIF database.
2.6 | Population genetic and phylogenetic analyses
2.6.1 | DNA extraction, PCR, and sequencing
To estimate gene flow in S. canadensis from North America to China 
and phylogenetic relationships among the 80 invasive and native 
populations that we sampled in the field, we sequenced two chloro-
plast spacer regions (psbA-trnH and trnL-F) using four universal primer 
pairs (Appendix 2) (de Andrade et al., 2010). We sequenced 8–14 
individuals per population. The primers were synthesized by Sangon 
Biotechnology Company (Shanghai, China). The PCR mix with a total 
volume of 20 μl comprised: 1 × PCR buffer, 2.5 mM Mg2+, 4 ng tem-
plate DNA, 0.15 μM each for forward and reverse primer, 0.3 mM 
4 × dNTP mixture, and 1.5 U Taq polymerase (Promega Cooperation, 
Madison, Wisconsin, USA). PCR amplifications were performed in a 
PTC 220 Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, California, 
USA) as follows: denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 40 cy-
cles of 45 s at 94°C, 45 s at 57°C, 90 s at 72°C, with a final elongation 
of 20 min at 72°C. PCR products were then sequenced using ABI au-
tosequencer by Sangon Biotechnology Company (Shanghai, China). 
All the 536 sequences were aligned using MEGA v 10.0.5 software 
(Kumar, Stecher, Li, Knyaz, & Tamura,  2018) and then trimmed to 
782 bp, which included insertions and deletions.
2.6.2 | Population genetic diversity and 
structure analyses
To test whether patterns of genetic diversity differed between S. 
canadensis populations in the invaded (China) and native (North 
America) ranges, we used sequences of the chloroplast spacer re-
gions (psbA-trnH and trnL-F) to estimate the number of polymor-
phic sites, the total number of haplotypes, haplotypic diversity (Hd), 
and nucleotide diversity (n) using ARLEQUIN v 3.5.2.2 (Excoffier 
 20457758, 2020, 12, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.6303, Wiley Online Library on [31/03/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License

WAN et al.
& Lischer, 2010). These diversity indices were computed for each 
population separately. We then fitted linear mixed-effect models (in 
r v 3.5.2) to test whether S. canadensis populations from the invaded 
range differed significantly in mean values of the diversity indices 
from S. canadensis populations in the native range. In the models, 
the diversity indices were treated as dependent variables, while S. 
canadensis range (invaded vs. native) was treated as a fixed-effect in-
dependent variable. Population identity of S. canadensis was treated 
as a random-effect independent variable and nested within range.
To test whether S. canadensis populations in the invaded range 
had a different genetic structure than S. canadensis populations in 
the native range, we used the same sequences above to perform 
hierarchical analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) (Excoffier, 
Smouse, & Quattro, 1992). The AMOVA was performed using the 
global data set to compare genetic structuring between invaded and 
native ranges, and hierarchically for the invaded and native ranges 
separately using individual populations. The hierarchical AMOVA 
divides the total genetic variance into components due to interin-
dividual differences within a population and interpopulation differ-
ences within a range. Genetic differentiation between ranges and 
among populations within ranges was compared by the fixation 
index (FST) and tested by AMOVA in ARLEQUIN v 3.5.2.2 (Excoffier 
& Lischer, 2010). Significance of genetic differentiation was tested 
by 1,000 random permutations. The minority cytotype exclusion hy-
pothesis predicts that there could be a restricted gene flow between 
polyploid and progenitor diploid populations (Levin,  1975), which 
could influence genetic structure of populations that contain differ-
ent cytotypes. Therefore, we also performed AMOVA based only on 
purely hexaploid populations that occurred in the invaded range and 
mixed-ploidy populations in the native range that contained at least 
one hexaploid cytotype.
2.6.3 | Testing for population 
demographic expansion
Changes in demographic history can influence the frequency of al-
leles, the distribution of mutations, and the coalescent times of gene 
copies (Zhang, Edwards, Kang, & Fuller, 2012). Hence, we inferred 
the effects of past demographic expansion on the current genetic 
variation in invaded and native ranges using Tajima's D and Fu's FS 
neutrality tests (Fu, 1997; Tajima, 1989) and pairwise mismatch dis-
tributions between haplotypes (Rogers & Harpending,  1992). The 
neutrality tests were performed with DnaSP v. 6 (Rozas et al., 2017), 
while the mismatch distribution analyses, which test patterns of 
nucleotide variation against a null model expected under a sudden 
population expansion, were implemented in ARLEQUIN v 3.5.2.2 
(Excoffier & Lischer, 2010) using 10,000 bootstrap replicates. In the 
neutrality tests, examination of deviation from neutrality was based 
on 1,000 coalescent simulations. Nonstatistical difference from zero 
rejects the null hypothesis of neutral evolution. Significant negative 
values of Tajima's D and Fu's FS indicate an excess of young or rare 
alleles in the genealogy, which suggest recent population expansion 
or purifying selection (Fu, 1997; Tajima, 1989). On the other hand, 
significant positive values indicate processes such as recent popula-
tion bottlenecks or balancing selection (Fu, 1997; Tajima, 1989). A 
mismatch distribution analysis calculates various population param-
eters, such as the raggedness index (r), with significantly ragged pop-
ulations having stable demographic histories and non-significantly 
ragged populations having sudden population growth (Rogers & 
Harpending, 1992). For data distributed according to a sudden popu-
lation expansion model (i.e., non-significant r indices), the mismatch 
distribution analysis computes parameters of demographic expan-
sion such as moment estimators of time to the expansion (Tau = 2Tu), 
effective population size before expansion (Theta0, θ0), and effective 
population size after expansion (Theta1, θ1) between the observed 
and expected mismatches (Rogers & Harpending, 1992). Departure 
from a model of sudden expansion was tested for each population 
by summing the squared differences (SSD) between observed and 
estimated mismatch distribution. To further infer the demographic 
history of S. canadensis, we determined genealogical relationships 
among haplotypes using the statistical parsimony algorithm imple-
mented in ARLEQUIN v 3.5.2.2 (Excoffier & Lischer, 2010). A star-
shaped genealogy indicates a lack of (or limited) geographic structure 
and suggests a signature of rapid population expansion (Slatkin & 
Hudson,  1991). Genealogical relationships among the haplotypes 
were inferred using a combined data set of invasive and native haplo-
types and separately for the two sets of haplotypes.
2.6.4 | Analysis of phylogenetic relatedness
To test whether all the 80 populations of S. canadensis that we sam-
pled in the invaded and native ranges belonged to the same spe-
cies  (i.e., S. canadensis), we performed analyses of phylogenetic 
relatedness using sequences of 34 haplotypes that were  derived 
from 536 individual sequences of the two chloroplast spacer re-
gions (psbA-trnH and trnL-F). We applied three methods, namely the 
Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood, and Neighbor-Joining. 
We performed Maximum Parsimony analyses with all characters 
equally weighted and gaps treated as missing data. For the Maximum 
Likelihood analyses, maximum likelihood trees were generated using 
the Jukes–Cantor model, the Gamma distributed with the Invariant 
Sites (G + I) option for the rates among sites, and use all the sites op-
tion for the Gaps/Missing Data Treatment. For the Neighbor-Joining 
analysis, we applied the default settings. After 1,000 rapid bootstrap 
search step, bootstrap values of each node were visualized. As out-
groups, we used sequences of the two chloroplast spacer regions 
(psbA-trnH and trnL-F) for S. canadensis seeds that we obtained from 
the Germplasm Resources Information Network of the United States 
Department of Agriculture (accession number W6 52,837) and a con-
gener S. decurrens. The congener was collected from Kuocangshan 
Mountain in Linhai City, Zhejiang Province, China, and identified 
by Prof. Ming Jiang in Taizhou University, China. All phylogenetic 
analyses were performed with MEGA v 10.0.5 (Kumar et al., 2018).

3 | RESULTS
3.1 | Cytobiogeography of S. canadensis
Among all the 80 S. canadensis populations that we sampled in China 
and North America, all invasive populations had hexaploid indi-
viduals (Figure 1 and Appendix 1). In contrast, in the native range, 
nine populations had a mixture of diploid and hexaploid individu-
als, eight populations were purely hexaploid, and three populations 
were purely diploid (Figure 1 and Appendix 1). Only one individual S. 
canadensis plant (from Bend City population in Oregon State, USA) 
was tetraploid (Appendix 1). In total, the invasive populations had 
1, 474 hexaploid individuals, while the native populations had 414 
hexaploid individuals (Appendix 1). There were 162 diploid individu-
als in the native range (Appendix 1).
3.2 | Functional traits
Invasive hexaploids were significantly taller and had a greater stem-
base diameter than native hexaploids (Figure 2a & b). Similar results 
were found when invasive hexaploids were compared with native 
hexaploids from the same climatic zone (i.e., humid subtropical) 
(Appendix 3a & b). Native hexaploids had greater mean values of 
the two traits than native diploids (Figure  2c  &  d). Similar results 
were found when native hexaploids from mixed-ploidy populations 
were compared with native diploids from mixed-ploidy populations 
(Appendix 3c & d).
3.3 | Climatic envelopes of S. canadensis
The PCA revealed two principal components that cumulatively 
explained 74% of variation in the climatic data (Figure 3). The first 
principal component (PC1) explained 44% of the variation and re-
flected a precipitation gradient, while the second component (PC2) 
explained 30% of the variation and was correlated strongly with

temperature variables (Figure 3). Independent of the ploidy level and 
the different sets of occurrence locations that we used in the analy-
sis (our 80 field-sampled populations versus 2,134 GBIF occurrence 
records), the climatic space occupied by invasive and native popula-
tions of S. canadensis was neither significantly equivalent (p = 1.00) 
nor similar (p > 0.14) (Table 1). In all cases, climatic envelopes clearly 
differentiated along the temperature gradient (PC2), with invasive 
populations preferring warmer and less seasonal climates (Figure 3). 
The invasive populations exhibited a contraction in climatic toler-
ance (i.e., the ratio of the climate inhabited by native populations 
to that by invasive populations was significantly greater than one) 
(Table 1). However, the invasive hexaploids and native hexaploids in-
habited similar climates (p = 0.92 along PC1 and p = 0.46 along PC2) 
(Table 1). An analysis of a pooled data set of the 80 populations that 
we surveyed in China and North America did not find a significant 
difference in the climatic conditions among the populations (p = 0.74 
along PC1 and p = 0.75 along PC2) (Table 1). In addition, diploid and 
hexaploid native populations occurred in similar climatic conditions 
(D = 0.78; equivalency test; p = 0.02; Appendix 4).

precipitation seasonality, and precipitation of coldest quarter) and 
significant negative correlations with four (isothermality, minimum 
temperature of coldest month, mean temperature of warmest 
quarter, and precipitation of wettest quarter) bioclimatic variables 
(Appendix 5).
3.5 | Genetic diversity of S. canadensis in the 
invaded and native ranges
We found a total of 34 haplotypes from 536 sequences (289 se-
quences for invasive populations vs. 247 sequences for native 
populations) based on the two chloroplast spacer regions (psbA-
trnH and trnL-F) (Appendix 6). The native range harbored 32 of 
the haplotypes, while the invaded range harbored five of the 
haplotypes. Haplotype H1 was the most abundant and widely dis-
tributed as it occurred in all the invasive populations and in 75% 
of the native populations (Appendix 6). Two other haplotypes (H9 
and H11) occurred in both invaded and native ranges. The rest of 
the haplotypes were private, as they occurred exclusively in the 
invaded (H32 and H34) and native (H2-H8, H10, H12-H31, and 
H33) ranges (Appendix 6). A geographic structure in the distribu-
tion of the haplotypes is also reflected in the haplotype network, 
which did not have a perfect star-like pattern in the analysis using 
a combined data set of invasive and native haplotypes (Appendix 
7) and separate analyses for the two sets of haplotypes (results 
not shown). The invasive populations had a significantly lower 
mean number of polymorphic sites and haplotypes per population 
than native populations (Table 2). However, mean haplotypic and 
nucleotide diversities were similar between the invaded and na-
tive populations (Table 2).

differentiation between invasive populations in China and native 
populations in North America (Table 3). There was also a signifi-
cant genetic variation among all the invasive and native popula-
tions combined (40.46%), although most of the genetic variation 
occurred within populations (52.27%) (Table 3). Within each range, 
genetic divergence among populations was higher in North America 
(FST = 0.523) than in China (FST = 0.329) (Table 3). Nonetheless, the 
invasive populations exhibited higher within-population genetic 
variation (67.10%) than the native populations (47.68%) (Table 3). 
An additional AMOVA based only on purely hexaploid populations 
that occurred in the invaded range and mixed-ploidy populations 
in the native range that contained at least one hexaploid cytotype 
produced similar results (Appendix 8). A phylogenetic tree of the 
34 haplotypes generated using the Maximum Likelihood, Maximum 
Parsimony, and Neighbor-Joining methods revealed that clade for-
mation received only a weak bootstrap support (Appendices 9–11). 
The hypothesis of recent population demographic expansions or 
purifying selection among the invasive populations was supported 
by Fu's FS test statistic (Fu's FS = −4.905; p = 0.007), while Tajima's 
D test statistic did not provide support (Tajima's D  =  −1.46; 
p > 0.1). However, for the native populations, both test statistics 
supported the hypothesis (Tajima's D = −2.43; p < 0.01 and Fu's 
FS = −8.34; p < 0.001). However, results of mismatch distribution 
analyses did not support the hypothesis of demographic expansion 
in the native populations (raggedness index = 0.072; p = 0.000 and 
SSD  =  0.047; p  =  0.010). A mismatch distribution is not shown 
for invasive populations because the least-square procedure to fit 
expected-to-observed distributions did not converge after 2 000 
steps.
4 | DISCUSSION
The present study used S. canadensis to test whether invasive pop-
ulations had a higher proportion of polyploids, were significantly 
larger, and occupied a wider range of climatic conditions than con-
specific native-range populations. Because biogeographic differ-
ences between invasive and native populations in cytotype frequency 
and functional traits could be due to stochastic founder events, the 
study also tested whether the invasive populations had overcome (or 
minimized) founder effects. We found that all invasive S. canadensis 
populations sampled in China were purely hexaploid, while the native 
populations sampled in North America were diploid, tetraploid, and 
hexaploid. The invasive hexaploids were significantly taller and had a  
larger stem-base diameter than native hexaploids. Within the native 
range, hexaploid S. canadensis plants were significantly taller and had 
a larger stem-base diameter than conspecific diploids. Climatic enve-
lope assessment found that invasive and native populations occupied 
different climatic conditions, with invasive populations occurring in 
warmer and less seasonal climates than native populations. However, 
there was no significant correlation between ploidy level and the cli-
matic envelope of S. canadensis, at least along the two axes of the PCA 
that cumulatively explained 74% of variation in climate. Our results 
are robust to a sampling bias because two comparisons involving a 
global data set of S. canadensis occurrence records versus a part of 
invaded range in China and the global data set versus the entire in-
vaded range produced similar results (Table 1 and Figure 4). Molecular 
phylogeography data provide signatures of reduced genetic founder 
effects in the invaded range, likely as a result of multiple introduction 
events. Taken together, these results suggest that ploidy level does not

influence climatic space of S. canadensis and that other factors may 
determine its invasiveness in China.
4.1 | Cytobiogeography and functional trait 
differences
The present findings that invasive S. canadensis populations in 
China were comprised only of hexaploid individuals, while native 
populations in North America were diploid, tetraploid, and hexa-
ploid, could be explained by three nonmutually exclusive hypoth-
eses. First, it is plausible that only hexaploid plants were able to 
adapt to new conditions after introduction and compete with 
native species, while other cytotypes failed. Second, because S. 
canadensis was introduced to China as an ornamental garden plant 
(Xu et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2015), it is possible gardeners preferen-
tially introduced hexaploids that had some unique desirable traits 
like larger sizes. Third, because invasive plant introductions are

often stochastic events, strong founder events may have caused a 
loss of cytotype diversity in the invaded range (Mráz et al., 2014). 
This may occur particularly when there is a spatial separation of 
the different cytotypes in the native range, which increases the 
chance that only a subset of the cytotypic diversity is introduced 
(Kubatova et  al.,  2008; Lafuma, Balkwill, Imbert, Verlaque, & 
Maurice, 2003). However, the second and third scenarios seem less 
plausible because our molecular phylogeography data (Tables 2–3 
and Appendix 8) and previous studies (Xu et  al.,  2012; Zhao 
et al., 2015) suggest that the Chinese populations have minimized 
founder effects through multiple introductions.
The present finding that invasive S. canadensis hexaploids had 
greater height and stem-base diameter than native hexaploids 
(Figure 2) and that the two traits were significantly correlated with 
various bioclimatic factors negatively and positively (Appendix 5) sug-
gests that divergence in the trait means could be the outcome of dif-
ferential natural selection imposed by the climatic factors. Evolution 
of increased sizes has been associated with invasiveness of several 
plant species (e.g., Oduor et  al.,  2013; Whitney & Gabler,  2008; 
Oduor, Stift, & van Kleunen, 2015a; Oduor, van Kleunen, & Stift, 
2017  ). Other studies that compared traits of invasive polyploids 
and conspecific native-range polyploids in common-garden settings 
produced mixed results. For instance, the invasive Oxalis pes-caprae 
tetraploids produced more aboveground biomass and offspring bulbs 
than native O. pes-caprae tetraploids (Tavares et al., 2019). Within 
S. gigantea, invasive tetraploids produced more biomass than na-
tive-range hexaploids (Nagy et al., 2018). In contrast, invasive tet-
raploid C. stoebe had similar length and number of florets, length of 
capitula and longest branch, leaf weight and leaf area as conspecific 
native tetraploids (Mráz, 2011). In Vicia cracca, invasive tetraploids 
had greater seedling height and aboveground biomass than native 
tetraploids; however, the two groups of plants produced similar num-
bers of seeds and branches (Líblová, Eliášová, & Münzbergová, 2017). 
Biogeographical comparisons of traits that use small and nonrepre-
sentative subsets of populations may not give a complete picture of 
the ecological and evolutionary processes that cause trait divergence 
between invaded and native ranges (Rosche et al., 2019). Moreover, 
comparisons of plant traits between ranges through in situ field mea-
surements can give different results from common-garden experi-
ments (Rosche et al., 2019). Therefore, more comprehensive studies 
that span the entire invaded and native ranges of S. canadensis and 
combine manipulative common-garden experiments with cytobioge-
ography and molecular phylogeography are required to more rigor-
ously test whether divergence in ploidy levels and functional traits 
between ranges could be due to natural selection.
4.2 | No correlation between ploidy level and 
climatic envelope of S. canadensis
The invasive S. canadensis populations occupied a novel climatic 
envelope (i.e., there was no significant envelope overlap with na-
tive S. canadensis) and exhibited a contraction in climatic tolerance 
(i.e., occurred in warmer and less seasonal climates) relative to na-
tive S. canadensis populations independent of variation in ploidy 
level (Table 1; Figures 3 and 4). Within the native range, diploid and 
hexaploid S. canadensis populations occurred in similar climatic con-
ditions. While our sampling of S. canadensis cytotype distribution 
was limited to only parts of the invaded (China) and native (North 
America) ranges, with the invaded range dominated by one climatic 
zone, the present results suggest that polyploidy does not influence 
S. canadensis climatic tolerance. Future studies that cover the entire 
climatic ranges of the species are required to validate our findings.
4.3 | Population demographic expansions in 
both ranges
Results of Tajima's D and Fu's FS neutrality tests suggest that either pu-
rifying selection acted on the S. canadensis populations or the popula-
tions experienced recent demographic expansions. However, because 
the two chloroplast spacer regions (psbA-trnH and trnL-F) are non-
coding loci and are thus unlikely to be under selection, these results 
more likely indicate population demographic expansions. Although the 
Fu's FS neutrality test was significant for invasive populations, while 
Tajima's D was not, it has been shown that Fu's FS test is more powerful 
than Tajima's D (Ramos-Onsins & Rozas, 2002). This suggests that pop-
ulation demographic expansion occurred in the invaded range as well.
4.4 | Signatures of reduced genetic founder effects 
in the invaded range
The finding that invasive populations had significantly lower mean 
number of polymorphic sites and haplotypes than native populations 
(Table 2), and the AMOVA results showing genetic differentiation 
between invaded and native ranges (Tables 3; Appendix 8) suggest 
some degree of founder effect in the invaded range. Nevertheless, 
it is likely that the founder effect is not strong, likely as a result of 
multiple introduction events. Multiple introductions from distinct 
genetic sources may help to overcome founder effects (Novak & 
Mack, 1993). There are four lines of evidence supporting the likely 
scenario of multiple introduction events. First, there were similar 
levels of nucleotide and haplotypic diversities between the invaded 
and native ranges (Table  2). Second, the AMOVA results showing 
that a larger percentage of the total variance in the invaded range is 
harbored within populations compared to the lower percent of total 
variance harbored within populations in the native range suggest that 
populations are more clearly differentiated in the native range than 
in the invaded range (Table 3). It is likely that multiple introduction 
episodes from different populations in the native range converted 
the high level of among-population genetic variation in the native 
range to high within-population genetic variation in the introduced 
range. Third, there was a novel co-occurrence of two haplotypes H9 
and H11 in invasive populations in Taizhou that otherwise occurred in 
allopatric native-range populations in Massachusetts, Iowa, Illinois,

WAN et al.
Michigan, New Jersey, Wisconsin, and Rhode Island (Appendix 6 and 
Appendix 7). Thus, it is possible that pervasive movement of genetic 
materials in the invaded range following introduction from multiple 
sources contributed to a reduction in population differentiation and 
genetic bottleneck. Fourth, demographic expansions that we found 
to have occurred in the invaded range could also have contributed 
to a reduction in genetic founder effects. Demographic and range 
expansion are expected to generate an excess of recent, and thus 
rare, mutations. As S. canadensis has been present in China for at 
least 80 years, it is plausible that over multiple generations, muta-
tions increased genetic diversity in the invaded range.
4.5 | All sampled populations belonged to 
S. canadensis
Although the ecological envelope of S. canadensis can overlap with 
that of its congeners like S. gigantea and S. altissima in the native 
range, our analysis of phylogenetic relatedness among the study 
populations did not reveal any clear pattern of clade formation (i.e., 
all populations were monophyletic; Appendices 9–11). Thus, it is 
highly likely that the invasive and native populations that we sam-
pled in the field all belonged to S. canadensis.
5 | CONCLUSION
Our results suggest that polyploidy does not influence climatic toler-
ance of S. canadensis in its invaded and native ranges. While a caveat 
exists for our study because our sampling of S. canadensis cytobio-
geography did not cover its entire invaded and native ranges, the 
results instead indicate that unknown genetic and environmental 
factors may influence S. canadensis climatic tolerance. Our results 
provide a useful first step to comprehensively test whether poly-
ploidy influences climatic envelope of S. canadensis. For S. canaden-
sis, effects of polyploidy at molecular and nuclear levels have not 
been investigated and would be a first step in determining how 
genetic changes scale up to physiological processes and ultimately 
biogeographic distribution patterns. Therefore, future mechanis-
tic studies should couple cytobiogeographical and molecular phy-
logeography approaches with functional genomic approaches that 
document gene expression patterns under different ecological con-
ditions. In addition, experimental studies such as multisite common-
garden and reciprocal transplants in both invaded and native ranges 
will be required.
