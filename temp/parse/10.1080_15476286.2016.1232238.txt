ABSTRACT
In a complex organism, cell proliferation and apoptosis need to be precisely controlled in order for tissues
to develop correctly. Excessive cell proliferation can lead to diseases such as cancer. We have shown that
the exoribonuclease Dis3L2 is required for the correct regulation of proliferation in a natural tissue within
the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. Dis3L2 is a member of a highly conserved family of
exoribonucleases that degrade RNA in a 30-50 direction. We show that knockdown of dis3L2 in the
Drosophila wing imaginal discs results in substantial wing overgrowth due to increased cellular
proliferation rather than an increase in cell size. Imaginal discs are speciﬁed in the embryo before
proliferating and differentiating to form the adult structures of the ﬂy. Using RNA-seq we identiﬁed a small
set of mRNAs that are sensitive to Dis3L2 activity. Of the mRNAs which increase in levels and are therefore
potential targets of Dis3L2, we identiﬁed 2 that change at the post-transcriptional level but not at the
transcriptional level, namely CG2678 (a transcription factor) and pyrexia (a TRP cation channel). We also
demonstrate
a
compensatory
effect
between
Dis3L2
and
the
50-30
exoribonuclease
Pacman
demonstrating that these 2 exoribonucleases function to regulate opposing pathways within the
developing tissue. This work provides the ﬁrst description of the molecular and developmental
consequences of Dis3L2 inactivation in a non-human animal model. The work is directly relevant to the
understanding of human overgrowth syndromes such as Perlman syndrome.

Introduction
Regulation of cell proliferation is of crucial importance to all
multicellular organisms. Cells must proliferate throughout
development in order for the organism to grow to adult size.
Proliferation must also occur to repair damaged areas during
the process of wound healing. Control of proliferation is there-
fore vitally important to allow individual animals and their
constituent organs to grow to their correct sizes, as well as to
maintain symmetry between the left and right sides of an ani-
mal.1 In an epithelial tissue subjected to damage, cell prolifera-
tion can be stimulated by apoptosis to heal the wound,
demonstrating a balance between apoptosis and proliferation.2
However, uncontrolled cell proliferation is a hallmark of cancer
with many genes involved in growth and proliferation impli-
cated in cancer progression.3
This paper describes the discovery of a new player in the
control of cell proliferation within a tissue, namely the exoribo-
nuclease Dis3L2. Dis3L2 is a 30-50 exoribonuclease and is a
member of the highly conserved RNaseII/RNB family of 30-50
exoribonucleases.4 Prokaryotes and some eukaryotes such as S.
cerevisiae harbour a single member of this family (Dis3)
whereas other eukaryotes including S. pombe and Drosophila
melanogaster encode 2 enzyme paralogues (Dis3 and Dis3L2).5
In humans, there is an additional paralogue, Dis3L1. Dis3L2,
unlike Dis3 and Dis3L1, does not contain the N-terminal PIN
domain5,6 which confers endoribonucleolytic activity to Dis3,
and tethers it to the exosome, a multicomponent protein com-
plex. Recent work has shown that Dis3L2 is primarily cyto-
plasmic and acts independently of the exosome to degrade both
mRNAs and non-coding RNAs.5-7 In humans and S. pombe,
this often occurs following the addition of a polyuridine
(polyU) tract to the 30 end of the transcript, which provides a
binding site for Dis3L2 to initiate/reinitiate 30-50 decay.5,8,9
miRNAs such as pre-let-7 have also been shown to be poly-uri-
dylated and then degraded by Dis3L2 in human cells and
mouse embryonic stem cells.10,11 In human cells, Dis3L2 has
been shown to degrade miR-27a by target RNA-directed
miRNA degradation and to associate with Ago2 in the RNA
induced silencing complex (RISC).7
The clinical importance of Dis3L2 is demonstrated by its
association with Perlman syndrome and Wilms’ tumor suscep-
tibility.12,13 Perlman syndrome is a congenital overgrowth

condition which is inherited in an autosomal recessive man-
ner.14 Affected children display foetal gigantism, abnormal
enlargement of organs (e.g. kidneys), facial abnormalities, neu-
rodevelopmental delay and high neonatal mortality. Histologi-
cal examinations reveal nephroblastomatosis, which is an
important precursor for Wilms’ tumor. Germline mutations in
these children are consistent with a loss of function of
Dis3L2.12 In addition, a truncation of the DIS3L2 locus has
been associated with a Marfan-like syndrome with skeletal
overgrowth.15 Dis3L2 is also likely to be important in sporadic
Wilms’ tumor as 30% of these tumors (6/20) show partial or
complete DIS3L2 deletion.12 Understanding the cellular and
molecular pathways controlled by Dis3L2 in a well character-
ized model system such as Drosophila melanogaster is likely to
shed light on the molecular basis of these diseases.
In this paper we show, for the ﬁrst time, a role for Dis3L2
in the proliferation of imaginal disc cells during Drosophila
melanogaster development. Imaginal discs are speciﬁed in the
embryo before proliferating and differentiating during larval
and pupal stages respectively to form the adult structures of
the ﬂy (e.g., wings, legs). Wing imaginal discs provide an
excellent model system for the study of growth homeostasis
because the cells being studied are in their natural context of
a developing organism, rather than as immortalized tissue
culture cells. Here we show that depletion of dis3L2 leads to
increased proliferation of cells in the wing imaginal discs,
without an increase in cell size, resulting in larger wings in
the adult ﬂy. Using RNA-seq, we have evidence that Dis3L2
regulates the expression of a discrete set of transcripts includ-
ing a mRNA encoding a cation channel. In addition, we show
that the increase in proliferation caused by depletion of
dis3L2 can be compensated with mutations for the gene
encoding the 50-30 exoribonuclease Pacman/Xrn1. Therefore,
these 2 ribonucleases, which degrade RNA in opposite direc-
tions, appear to affect the antagonistic pathways of apoptosis
and proliferation. Since Pacman and Dis3L2 are highly con-
served throughout evolution, it is likely that they will have
similar functions in other multicellular organisms.
Results
Dis3L2 is not required for Drosophila melanogaster
viability
We have previously shown that ubiquitous knockdown of Dis3
results in complete lethality at or prior to the L2 larval stage.16
To test whether Dis3L2 (CG16940) is required for viability,
ubiquitous GAL4 drivers were used to knockdown dis3L2
throughout the whole organism. Two separate UAS-dis3L2RNAi
lines, each targeting different sequences within both isoforms
of the dis3L2 gene were used for each GAL4 driver. Ubiquitous
knockdown using tubulin-GAL4 (tub-GAL4), actin-GAL4 (act-
GAL4) or daughterless-GAL4 (da-GAL4) drivers resulted in a
strong, 9.7-fold knockdown of dis3L2 (to 10% of its level in
controls). This was not associated with any lethality (Fig. S1A-
B) and shows that Dis3L2, unlike Dis3, is dispensable for Dro-
sophila viability. These ﬁndings are consistent with previous
data from S. pombe5 and human cell lines6,9 which also show
no effect on cell viability following dis3L2 depletion.
Loss of dis3L2 in the wing imaginal discs results in wing
overgrowth
We used the wing imaginal disc as a speciﬁc tissue to explore
the role of Dis3L2 in tissue growth and development. The wing
imaginal disc is divided into distinct regions with the wing
pouch region giving rise to the wing blade (Fig. 1A) and the tip
of the wing disc forming part of the thorax. Restricted knock-
down was achieved using GAL4 drivers with speciﬁc expression
within the wing imaginal disc (Fig. 1). Depletion of dis3L2
throughout the wing imaginal disc (UAS-dis3L2RNAi/C ;69B-
GAL4/C) resulted in a 5.2-fold knockdown of dis3L2 mRNA
(to 20% of its level in controls)(Fig. 1B). This knockdown
resulted in wings that are 123% the size of controls (Fig. 1C).
However, the 69B-GAL4 driver also drives in the epidermis,
together with the eye and ventral thoracic imaginal discs.24 To
ensure the observed overgrowth was due to an effect within the
wing disc a more speciﬁc GAL4 driver was used. Use of the
nubbin-GAl4 driver (nub-GAL4), which drives expression
within the wing pouch of the disc, to knockdown dis3L2 also
resulted in wings that were 21% larger than parental controls
(Fig. 1D). To ensure the apparent overgrowth of the wings was
not simply due to an increase in the size of the knockdown ﬂies,
individual ﬂies were weighed and the wing area was normalized
to the mass of the ﬂy. Normalization of wing area made no dif-
ference to the overgrowth observed (Fig. 1C-D). For the above
experiments, driving the expression of an unrelated shRNA
(UAS-EGFPRNAi) did not result in an increase of wing size com-
pared to controls. Use of a second UAS-dis3L2RNAi line also
gave identical results (Fig. S1C-D). These data therefore pro-
vide strong evidence that reduced expression of dis3L2 within
the wing imaginal discs results in the overgrowth of the adult
wings.
To provide further evidence that dis3L2 knockdown results
in wing overgrowth, we used an engrailed-GAL4 (en-GAL4)
driver, which drives expression in the posterior compartment
of the wing, so that the anterior compartment of the wing pro-
vides an internal control for wing size. Depletion of dis3L2
using en-GAL4 results in a signiﬁcant overgrowth of the poste-
rior region of the wing (Fig. 1E). The anterior area also showed
a very slight (2.7%) but statistically signiﬁcant overgrowth.
However, this is most likely a knock-on effect of the 11.3%
overgrowth observed in the posterior compartment. To ensure
it is not only the posterior compartment that is susceptible to
overgrowth we measured the anterior and posterior areas of
the nub-GAL4 driven knockdown wings and as expected the
anterior and posterior areas showed comparable overgrowth of
24.9% and 18.5%, respectively (Fig. S1E). Therefore, it appears
that Dis3L2 functions to control the area of the Drosophila
wing.
The effect of Dis3L2 on overgrowth is not consistent across
the whole ﬂy
To assess if wing disc tissue is particularly sensitive to the loss
of dis3L2 we further examined the ﬂies with ubiquitous dis3L2
knockdown (RNAi driven by act-GAL4, tub-GAL4 or da-
GAL4). Although the knockdown ﬂies had signiﬁcantly larger
wings than parental controls (Fig. S2A-C), they were not
RNA BIOLOGY

signiﬁcantly larger in terms of mass (Fig. S2D). This shows that
the knockdown of dis3L2 throughout the organism does not
induce overgrowth of the whole ﬂy. Therefore, it appears that
there is a level of tissue speciﬁcity in the activity of Dis3L2,
which would be consistent with the phenotypes of Perlman
syndrome speciﬁcally affecting overgrowth of speciﬁc organs
such as the liver and kidney.
dis3L2 depletion results in increased cell number rather
than increased cell size
The overgrowth phenotype observed could occur in 2 ways;
either an increase in cell number (hyperplasia) or an increase
in cell size (hypertrophy). To determine which of these 2 pro-
cesses was occurring, we counted the total number of cells
within the wing of the control and dis3L2 knockdown ﬂies.
Since a single hair protrudes from each cell of the wing, the
number of hairs can be counted to give an accurate count of
the number of cells within the wing. The average number of
hairs within 0.1mm2 regions (representing both the anterior
and posterior domains) was calculated (Fig. 2A). This, along
with the area of the wing was then used to estimate the total
number of cells as well as their size. We observed that while the
density of cells within the 0.1mm2 regions remained unchanged
(Fig. 2Bi and Ci), indicating no change in cell size, there were
119% the number of cells in the dis3L2-depleted wings com-
pared to controls (Fig. 2Bii and Cii). This indicates a hyperpla-
sic response rather than hypertrophy of the wing. Therefore,
Dis3L2 seems to play a role in controlling the proliferation of
cells within the wing imaginal disc.
The proliferative effect of dis3L2 knockdown occurs early
in development
To determine the developmental time point at which the prolif-
erative effect of dis3L2 knockdown is observed we used the
temperature sensitive GAL80ts system that allows temperature
controlled knockdown of dis3L2.18 Maintaining the ﬂies at the
permissive temperature of 19C allows GAL80ts mediated
repression of the UAS-GAL4 system, therefore inhibiting any

knockdown. However, moving the ﬂies to 29C results in inhi-
bition of GAL80ts and subsequent knockdown of dis3L2. Our
previous results19 have shown the perdurance of the system to
be between 24 and 32 hours. For these experiments we used the
69B-GAL4 wing disc driver and progeny cultured at 19C and
29C as negative and positive controls respectively.
Knockdown of dis3L2 at the start of the 2nd instar (L2) and
3rd instar (L3) larval stages resulted in signiﬁcant overgrowth of
the wings (Fig. 3A). However, knockdown during the mid 3rd
instar larval stage and at the start of the pupal stage resulted in
wings of wild type size (Fig. 3A). Together, these data indicate
that Dis3L2 activity is required during early larval stages to
control cell number. Therefore, Dis3L2 is likely to affect tran-
scripts controlling cell proliferation of the wing imaginal discs
during the early larval stages, which subsequently affects the
later development of the wing.
Depletion of dis3L2 results in overgrowth of the wing
imaginal discs
The above GAL80ts experiment predicted that Dis3L2 is
required during larval development to regulate cell number in
the wing imaginal discs. To test this, we dissected wing imagi-
nal discs from late L3 larvae and measured their sizes relative
to parental controls. Knockdown of dis3L2 using the 69B-GAL4
driver resulted in discs that were 132.0% the size of their
respective controls (Fig. 3B) while use of the nub-GAL4 driver
increased the size of the discs to 121.6% the size of controls
(Fig. S3). The difference in the level of overgrowth between the
2 drivers is most likely due to their expression domains; nub-
GAL4 drives expression within the wing pouch whereas the
69B-GAL4 expresses throughout the entire disc.
To conﬁrm that the overgrowth was due to an increase in
cell proliferation we used phosphohistone H3 (PH3) as a
marker for cells undergoing mitosis. Late L3 wing discs were
stained with anti-PH3, the nuclei undergoing mitosis were
counted and the mitotic index was calculated (see Materials
and Methods). This indicates that a signiﬁcantly higher per-
centage of cells are undergoing mitosis in the dis3L2 knock-
down wing discs (120.5%) compared to parental control discs
(Fig. 3C-D). These data therefore show that the loss of dis3L2
results in an increased rate of cell division within the wing
imaginal disc, which in turn leads in an increase in the total
area of the tissue and larger adults wings.
RNA-sequencing shows that Dis3L2 affects the expression
of a small number of genes
To identify the RNAs that are misregulated in dis3L2 knock-
down imaginal discs and are likely to cause the above pheno-
types, we used genome-wide RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). We
compared wing imaginal discs where dis3L2 was knocked
down to 20% of the level in parental controls, using the 69B-
GAL4 driver (dis3L2RNAi/C ;69B-GAL4/C) (Fig. 1B) with the 2
parental stocks used to generate the knockdown ﬂies ( ;UAS-
dis3L2RNAi; and ;;69B-GAL4) used as controls. Total RNA was
prepared from 2 biological replicates of 60 dissected wing imag-
inal discs per genotype and then subjected to RNA-seq. RNA-
seq reads were subsequently analyzed using the cufﬂinks pipe-
line (see Materials and Methods). The number of reads
obtained for each sample together with the non-default param-
eters used during the analysis can be found in Fig. S4.
We ﬁrst compared the overall expression distributions for
the 2 parental controls to ensure it was reasonable to group

them together as a total ‘control’ group. Kernel density plots
showed no signiﬁcant difference (Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS)
test p D 0.555) indicating that the overall expression proﬁles of
the 2 controls was very consistent (Fig. 4A). The four parental
replicates were therefore grouped to form the “control” group.
The kernel density plots show 3 major peaks comprising tran-
scripts expressed at a very low level (far left), transcripts
expressed at a moderate level (center) and a small set of tran-
scripts expressed at a very high level (far right). Comparing the
expression distributions within the control discs and the dis3L2
knockdown discs showed a general and signiﬁcant shift in
expression of genes normally expressed at low levels to a level
of greater expression (KS test p D 1.041e¡6) (Fig. 4B). This is
consistent with the known function of Dis3L2 and suggests
that the exoribonuclease Dis3L2 normally functions to main-
tain a set of discrete transcripts at low levels.
Fig. 4C shows a scatter plot comparing the expression levels
of individual genes in dis3L2 knockdown discs with those of
the grouped parental controls. After stringent ﬁltering (see
Materials and Methods), a total of 239 genes (2.7% of total
detected) were reported as differentially expressed between the
2 groups (red dots). Therefore, Dis3L2 regulates a very small
number of transcripts, which is a similar conclusion to our pre-
vious work showing that the 50-30 exoribonuclease Pacman has
speciﬁcity for particular mRNAs.20,21 Consistent with the
expression distributions those transcripts determined as misex-
pressed showed a low level of expression in parental control
discs. We also observed in our sequencing data that the consis-
tently misexpressed genes were distributed across all chromo-
some arms indicating there is neither a technical bias nor a
chromosome bias for Dis3L2 targets (Fig. S5).
qRT-PCR veriﬁcation of the RNA-seq results shows that
pyrexia and CG2678 are post-transcriptionally
upregulated in dis3L2 knockdown discs
Since Dis3L2 is an exoribonuclease that degrades RNAs, we
would expect its candidate targets to increase in expression in
the dis3L2 knockdown wing imaginal discs to produce the
observed phenotypes. A set of transcripts showed a decrease in
expression in the RNA-seq data (Fig. S6). However, of the 7
validated by qRT-PCR only one showed a reproducible
decrease in expression (dis3L2) with large biological variation
suggesting these are more likely to be due to indirect effects
(Fig. S7). Therefore, to validate genes sensitive to Dis3L2 activ-
ity we selected those that were the most consistently increased
in expression >1.5-fold in the knockdown discs (Fig. 5). From
this shortlist we selected those that showed the highest fold
changes while maintaining consistency between replicates in
addition to having an average FPKM of greater than 0.3. These
Figure 3. Knockdown of dis3L2 results in increased proliferation within the wing imaginal disc leading to overgrowth of the disc. (A) Using the GAL80ts system to control

development. –ve represents ﬂies that were maintained at the permissive 19C temperature throughout their development. Cve represents ﬂies that were maintained

area ( D p < 0.0001) compared to parental controls. The negative control (¡ve), mid L3 and start of pupal timings show no signiﬁcant increase in wing area of knock-
down ﬂies. “Control” represents the mean wing area of the 2 parental controls. n  37, error bars represent 95% conﬁdence limits. (B) Knockdown of dis3L2 in the wing

were taken forward for validation by quantitative RT-PCR
(qRT-PCR) on new biological replicates.
Fig. 6A shows that the changes in expression between dis3L2
knockdown and control discs were similar for the majority of
the selected transcripts according to the 2 techniques. For exam-
ple, cytochrome-c-distal (cyt-c-d) increased in expression by 7.2-
fold according to RNA-seq and by 7.4-fold by qRT-PCR. Simi-
larly, CG31808 increased 6.8-fold and 6.0 fold by RNA-seq and
qRT-PCR respectively. For other transcripts, such as pyrexia
(pyx) and CG2678 the change in expression detected by RT-PCR
was in agreement, but more modest than by RNA-seq (Table 1).
Only one gene, CG3457, did not show a signiﬁcant change in
expression by qRT-PCR. The veriﬁcation of the RNA-seq by
qRT-PCR demonstrates that we can have conﬁdence in the
changes presented by our RNA sequencing experiment.
To identify potential direct targets of Dis3L2 we tested
whether the expression changes of 4 upregulated mRNAs (by
qRT-PCR) were due to transcriptional or post-transcriptional
effects. As Dis3L2 functions to degrade mRNAs at the post-
transcriptional level we would expect Dis3L2 targets to be upre-
gulated at the mRNA but not the pre-mRNA level. Those genes
upregulated at the pre-mRNA level as well as the mRNA level
would be expected to be indirect targets, for example due to
Dis3L2 regulating an RNA encoding a transcription factor.
Transcriptional changes are observed for cyt-c-d and CG31808
as their pre-mRNAs increase in expression 6.6-fold and 4.3-
fold respectively (compared to 7.4 and 6.0 fold increases for the
mature mRNAs); indicating that the increases in expression are
likely to be due to indirect effects (Fig. 6B). However, pyrexia
and CG2678 show a clear regulation at the post-transcriptional
level as the expression of pre-pyx and pre-CG2678 do not
change signiﬁcantly in dis3L2 knockdown discs compared to
controls, but increase in expression by 2.4 and 2.1-fold respec-
tively at the mRNA level (Fig. 6B and Table 1). Therefore, of
the 4 mRNAs tested, 2 (pyx and CG2678) are upregulated at
the post-transcriptional level, suggesting that they are targets of
Dis3L2.
Dis3L2 and Pacman function to regulate opposing
pathways of apoptosis and proliferation
In previous work, we showed that mutations in the gene encod-
ing the 50-30 exoribonuclease pacman resulted in increased apo-
ptosis.21 In contrast, the work outlined above shows that
knockdown of the 30-50 exoribonuclease dis3L2 results in
increased proliferation. These results suggested to us that
knockdown of dis3L2 may rescue the effects of the pacman
mutations. To test this hypothesis, we again utilised the UAS-
GAL4 system to knockdown dis3L2 in the wing imaginal discs
of hypomorphic (pcm5) and null (pcm14) pacman mutants and
observed the phenotypic effects.
The hypomorphic pcm5 mutation has been shown to have
66% of the activity of the wild-type allele resulting in a small
wing phenotype.21,22 Knockdown of dis3L2 throughout the

UAS-dis3L2RNAi/C ; 69B-GAL4/C) results in wings that are not
signiﬁcantly different in size from control wings (Fig. 7A). This
shows that the phenotypic effects of the dis3L2 knockdown (i.e.
proliferation) compensate for the phenotypic effects of the
pcm5 mutation (i.e., apoptosis). To test this striking effect

further, we also knocked down dis3L2 throughout the wing
imaginal discs in the pacman null mutant, pcm14. The pcm14
mutation results in small wing imaginal discs leading to a
developmental delay and eventual pupal lethality.21 In conﬁr-
mation of the above results, dis3L2 knockdown in a pcm14
mutant background (pcm14/Y ; UAS-dis3L2RNAi/C ; 69B-GAL4/C)
results in late L3 wing imaginal discs of normal size, again
showing a compensatory effect between Dis3L2 depletion and
the pcm14 mutation (Fig. 7B).
In a previous paper,21 we showed that the pcm14 null muta-
tion results in an increase in apoptosis due to the post-tran-
scriptional upregulation of the pro-apoptotic genes hid and
reaper (rpr). In Drosophila, the key activators of the intrinsic
apoptosis pathway are the Hid, Grim and Reaper proteins.23 To
determine whether Dis3L2 derives its compensatory effects
from downregulation of rpr expression we compared the levels
of this RNA in the wing imaginal discs of pcm14 mutants with
or without additional dis3L2 knockdown. As shown in Fig. 7C,
levels of rpr mRNA are very similar in both cases indicating
Dis3L2 does not play a role in the regulation of rpr expression.
Conﬁrmation is provided by results showing that the dis3L2
knockdown alone has no signiﬁcant effect on either rpr pre-
mRNA or mature mRNA according to qRT-PCR (Fig. 7C) or
RNA-seq (1.07 fold change). Similarly, the knockdown of
dis3L2 within the wing imaginal disc has no effect on the
expression of hid or grim mRNA (Fig. S8).
To conﬁrm that knockdown of dis3L2 does not affect apo-
ptosis via the Hid, Grim or Reaper pathway, we made use of
the Df(3L)H99 deﬁciency, where these 3 genes (which are
located together on the chromosome) are deleted from the
genome. Heterozygous Df(3L)H99/C have larger wings than
wild-type controls due to reduced apoptosis in the wing discs

(Fig. S9). If dis3L2 knockdown was to inhibit the Hid, Grim and
Rpr apoptotic pathway we would expect knockdown of dis3L2
in a heterozygous Df(3L)H99 background to result in wings no
different in area to the Df(3L)H99/C controls or when dis3L2 is
knocked down in a wild-type background. In contrast, this
knockdown
(;
UAS-dis3L2RNAi/C
;
Df(3L)H99/69B-GAL4)
results in a signiﬁcant increase in wing area compared to either
Df(3L)H99/C controls or when dis3L2 is knocked down in a
wild-type background (UAS-dis3L2RNAi/C ; 69B-GAL4/C)
(Fig. 7D). Therefore, Dis3L2 acts independently of the Hid,
Grim and Reaper induced Caspase pathway and controls prolif-
eration rather than preventing apoptosis. The lack of redun-
dancy between these exoribonucleases is further illustrated by
the fact that following the loss of one decay enzyme (Dis3L2)
the cell does not increase the transcription of mRNAs encoding
either of the other major RNA decay enzymes, Pacman and
Dis3 to compensate (Fig. S10).
Although depletion of dis3L2 rescues wing disc area in pcm14
mutants, the dis3L2KD, pcm14 mutant larvae are still develop-
mentally delayed. We have previously shown that the 50-30
exoribonuclease Pacman post-transcriptionally regulates the
expression of the insulin-like peptide Dilp8 resulting in a devel-
opmental delay.20 To determine whether dilp8 levels are also
regulated by Dis3L2, we used qRT-PCR to assess the levels of
dilp8 pre-mRNA and mature mRNA after dis3L2 knockdown
with or without the pcm14 mutant background. Fig. 7E shows
that dilp8 mRNA levels increase approximately 8000 fold in
the dis3L2 knockdown pcm14 mutant discs (pcm14/Y ; UAS-
dis3L2RNAi/C ; 69B-GAL4/C) which is not signiﬁcantly differ-
ent to the increase in pcm14 discs (pcm14/Y ; UAS-dis3L2RNAi ;).
These data further emphasizes the speciﬁcity of transcripts
being targeted to particular exoribonucleases. Taken together
these data indicate that Dis3L2 and Pacman have opposing
functions of proliferation and apoptosis within cells, which are
achieved through the degradation of different and speciﬁc RNA
targets.
Discussion
In this study we show that the 30-50 exoribonuclease Dis3L2
controls organ size in Drosophila melanogaster. Knockdown of
dis3L2 in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc results in substan-
tial wing overgrowth due to increased cellular proliferation dur-
ing the larval stages. Using RNA-seq we have identiﬁed a small
set of mRNAs that are sensitive to Dis3L2 activity, with only
239 genes changing in expression >1.5-fold out of the 8837
detected. Of the mRNAs that increase in expression upon
dis3L2 knockdown, and are therefore likely to be targets of
Dis3L2, we identiﬁed 2 that change at the post-transcriptional
level but not at the transcriptional level, namely CG2678 and
pyrexia. We also demonstrate a compensatory effect between
Dis3L2 and the 50-30exoribonuclease Pacman where knock-
down of dis3L2 in a pacman mutant background results in a
normal wing size. Loss of Pacman results in increased apopto-
sis21 while dis3L2-depletion promotes proliferation demon-
strating that these 2 exoribonucleases function to regulate
opposing pathways within the developing tissue.
The results described in this paper are in agreement with
previous reports that Dis3L2, unlike its paralogue Dis3, is dis-
pensable for organism viability,5,6,9 indicating the speciﬁc roles
of these highly related exoribonucleases. However, we cannot
at present rule out that Dis3L2 is required during very early
developmental stages, as ubiquitous knockdown with the GAL4
drivers we have used is not effective prior to the syncytial blas-
toderm stage when the majority of zygotic transcription

commences. Our data are also in line with a previous paper
showing that Dis3L2 depletion in HeLa cells results in
increased cell proliferation.12 However, we do not have any evi-
dence that Dis3L2 knockdown inhibits apoptosis, as has previ-
ously been reported in HeLa cells.9 Since our study uses normal
cells in the context of a natural tissue rather than as immortal-
ised cells, it is not surprising that our results differ from the
above study. The use of a developing organism has also allowed
us to show that Dis3L2 normally represses cell proliferation
during the early developmental stages of wing disc develop-
ment (in L2 and early L3 larvae) as depletion in later stages
(mid L3 and early pupal) has no effect on proliferation, even
though Dis3L2 is normally expressed throughout wing disc
development.24 In addition, in common with the effect of
Dis3L2 in human diseases such as Perlman syndrome, our data
show that Dis3L2 has speciﬁc effects on certain tissues as ubiq-
uitous knockdown affects wing size but does not increase the
mass of the whole ﬂy. It is possible that Dis3L2 predominantly
affects tissues that are regenerative and/or particularly prolifer-
ative such as the kidneys and liver in humans and wing imagi-
nal discs in ﬂies.
The use of RNA-seq as an unbiased global approach
allowed us to characterize the ways that Dis3L2 functions
to control gene expression. Three main groups of tran-
scripts in L3 wing imaginal discs were identiﬁed: those that
are expressed at very high levels, those at moderate levels
and the Dis3L2 sensitive genes at a very low level. This pat-
tern of gene expression is consistent with our previous
work.20 The general low level of expression in control wing
imaginal discs for the Dis3L2 sensitive genes suggests a role

has a larger effect on wing overgrowth than the Df(3L)H99 mutation as a heterozygote (Control Df(3L)H99). However, knocking down dis3L2 in a heterozygous Df(3L)H99
background (Dis3L2KD Df(3L)H99) results in an additive effect where the wings are signiﬁcantly larger than dis3L2 knockdown wings alone. n  18, error bars represent

for Dis3L2 in maintaining the expression of these speciﬁc
genes at low levels, presumably to prevent the overgrowth
of the developing wing imaginal discs and wings. Our
results show that the depletion of dis3L2 results in the
deregulation of a small number of transcripts. The small
number may be due to silencing efﬁciency, but is more
likely to represent the substrates most sensitive to dis3l2
depletion. We have shown that the upregulation of the tran-
scripts that increase in expression occurs either at transcrip-
tional level or at the post-transcriptional level. The increase
in levels of cyt-c-d and CG31808 at the transcriptional level
suggest that depletion of dis3L2 results in an increase in
activity of one or more transcriptional activators, which in
turn enhance expression of these transcripts. Interestingly,
cyt-c-d and CG31808 neighbor each other on the left arm of
chromosome 2 with their 50UTRs overlapping. It is there-
fore possible that their increased expression is due to tran-
scriptional co-regulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
experiments from the modENCODE consortium25 have
identiﬁed binding sites for transcription factors such as Tri-
thorax-like (Trl), Dichaete (D), Distal-less (Dll) and Dorsal
(dl) within the overlapping region of cyt-c-d and CG31808.
Although the expression of these transcription factors at the
RNA level remains unchanged following dis3L2 knockdown
(Fig. S11) it is possible that their protein activity is altered
following the loss of Dis3L2 in the discs, which in turn
drives the observed increase in expression of cyt-c-d and
CG31808. Expression of cyt-c-d and CG31808 do not change
signiﬁcantly in pacman mutants,20 again demonstrating the
speciﬁcity of Dis3L2 on these cellular pathways.
The ﬁnding that cyt-c-d is upregulated in dis3L2 knockdown
tissue is interesting and suggests a mechanism whereby dis3L2
controls proliferation. Cytochrome C (Cyt c) is an essential
component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain,
which is involved in the generation of ATP. The role of cyt-c-d
in the generation of ATP in Drosophila cells is conﬁrmed by
experiments where knockdown of cyt-c-d using RNAi leads to
reduced ATP levels.26 In mammalian cells, it has been shown
that, under certain cellular conditions, Cyt c can be released
from mitochondria and bind to the apoptosome complex for
activation of initiator caspase-9.27 Although cyt-c-d mutations
(e.g. the point mutation cyt-c-dZ2-1091) result in inhibition of
apoptosis during development of the retina in Drosophila,28,29
the mechanism whereby this may occur in Drosophila is con-
troversial.27 Since our experiments show no effect of dis3l2
knockdown on apoptosis, a simple hypothesis is that increased
cyt-c-d levels result in an increase of ATP in the cell. Since ATP
is required for the generation of ribosomes, and ribosomes are
required for cell proliferation, the increase in cyt-c-d is consis-
tent with an increase in cell proliferation.
Our experiments have identiﬁed potential Dis3L2 targets,
CG2678 and pyx, which increase post-transcriptionally upon
dis3L2 depletion. These changes in expression have been shown
to be speciﬁc to the loss of Dis3L2 as they are not seen in pcm
mutant wing imaginal discs.20 CG2678 is predicted to encode a
transcription factor with homology to the human Kr€uppel
C2H2-type zinc ﬁnger proteins ZNF37A and ZNF768.24 The
biological functions of these proteins are not known. pyrexia
(pyx; dTRPA2; CG17142) encodes a transient receptor potential
(TRP) channel which mediates temperature response in Dro-
sophila.30 The TRP family of receptors are evolutionarily con-
served throughout metazoans and comprise ankyrin repeats
plus a cation transport membrane domain, which is particu-
larly permeable to potassium ions.31 Although the relationship
between pyx and proliferation has not been studied, it is known
that potassium ions are involved in the cell cycle and prolifera-
tion32 and that mutations in the gene encoding the TRP chan-
nel TRPP2 (PKD2) can result in polycystic kidney disease.33
Interestingly, the Drosophila retinoblastoma protein RBF1 and
the transcription factor E2F, both of which play important roles
in cell division and cell cycle regulation, bind to the promoter
of pyx thus linking pyx to cell proliferation.34 Regulation of the
potassium channel protein Pyx by Dis3L2 may represent a
novel way of controlling tissue proliferation.
The ﬁndings that the 30-50 exoribonuclease Dis3L2 regulates
proliferation while the 50-30 exoribonuclease Pacman controls
apoptosis are novel and intriguing. Our data strongly suggest
that Dis3L2 and Pacman regulate different and opposing path-
ways in proliferation and apoptosis, rather than both of them
affecting the same pathway in opposite directions. This is dem-
onstrated in our experiments showing that Dis3L2 is not func-
tioning to prevent overgrowth through the regulation of the
expression of the proapoptotic genes hid, grim and rpr. In con-
trast, our previous results21 showed that Pacman post-tran-
scriptionally
regulates

apoptosis.
Therefore, control of apoptosis and proliferation by these 2
exoribonucleases is achieved by regulation of independent cel-
lular pathways. Although Pacman and Dis3L2 can control the
balance of apoptosis/proliferation to determine the ﬁnal size of
the wing, they do not control compensatory pathways to con-
trol developmental delay. Knockdown of Dis3L2 does not affect
the expression of dilp8 or developmental delay in wild-type or
pcm mutant backgrounds further emphasizing the distinct tar-
get speciﬁcity of these 2 exoribonucleases. This result would
appear to conﬂict with previous experiments on human tissue
culture cells, which have identiﬁed an RNA-dependent interac-
tion between human Dis3L2 and XRN1, suggesting they target
the same RNAs for degradation.6 A possible explanation is that
many RNAs can be degraded by both the 50-30 and 30-50 path-
ways; however, there are a small number of transcripts which
are speciﬁcally targeted by Dis3L2 or Pacman.
How is this speciﬁcity achieved? Recent research has dem-
onstrated that Dis3L2 preferentially targets RNAs and pre-
miRNAs that are tailed by the addition of uridines.5,9-11 This
tailing is performed by uridyltranferases (TUTases) which in
Drosophila include the uridyl transferase Tailor. Tailor is
known to uridylate intron derived pre-miRNAs showing pref-
erence for substrates with a 30 terminal Guanine.35 Tailor may
also play a role in the uridylation of mRNA substrates and
therefore may be responsible for targeting speciﬁc mRNAs for
Dis3L2 degradation. A further possibility is that Dis3L2 targets
could have speciﬁc instability elements within their 30 UTRs,
similar to AU rich elements used by the exosome to target
mRNAs for decay.36,37 Finally, speciﬁcity may be conferred by
binding of speciﬁc miRNAs which then induce RNA degrada-
tion. In summary, our work has led to the discovery of the
importance of the 30-50 exoribonuclease Dis3L2 in cell prolifer-
ation plus tissue growth and shows that it controls a speciﬁc set

of RNAs independent of the 50-30 degradation pathway. This
work also demonstrates that Drosophila provides an excellent
model system to understand the molecular basis of human
overgrowth syndromes such as Perlman syndrome and Wilms’
tumor.

Fly husbandry
Fly stocks were cultivated on standard media in uncrowded
conditions at 25C unless otherwise stated. All stocks used
were obtained from the Bloomington stock center unless stated
otherwise.

en-GAL4, UAS-GFPactin/CyO;). The GAL80ts stock (w; P[tubP-

mington stocks 7019 (w; P[tubP-GAL80ts]20 ; TM2/TM6) and
1774 (w;; P{GawB}69B).
RNAi stocks were obtained from the Vienna Drosophila
RNAi Center. Stocks used were: UAS-dis3L2RNAi(stock v51854,
w1118 ;P{GD9240}v51854; and stock v100322, ;P{KK105902}

by both UAS-dis3L2RNAi lines were indistinguishable from each
other when driven by all drivers; all results shown are using
UAS-dis3L2RNAi stock v51854, except for Figs. S1 C/D and S2
Di/ii.
Genetic crosses and genotypes
To knockdown dis3L2 throughout the wing imaginal disc ;;69B-
GAL4 females were crossed to ;UAS-dis3L2RNAi; males produc-
ing knockdown offspring with the genotype ;UAS-dis3L2RNAi/C ;
69B-GAL4/C. In addition to the parental controls ;UAS-
EGFPRNAi; males were also crossed to ;;69B-GAL4 females to
produce control offspring ;UAS-EGFPRNAi/C ; 69B-GAL4/C
which accounted for the expression of a hairpin RNAi
construct.
To knockdown dis3L2 within the wing pouch of the wing
imaginal disc ;nub-GAL4; females were crossed to ;UAS-dis3-
L2RNAi; males producing knockdown offspring with the geno-
type ;UAS-dis3L2RNAi/nub-GAL4;. In addition to the parental
controls ;UAS-EGFPRNAi; males were also crossed to ;nub-
GAL4; females to produce control offspring (;UAS-EGFPRNAi-
nub-GAL4;) which accounted for the expression of a hairpin
RNAi construct.
dis3L2 knockdown was achieved in the posterior compart-
ment of the wing imaginal disc by crossing ;en-GAL4/CyO;
females to ;UAS-dis3L2RNAi; males to produce ;en-GAL4/UAS-
dis3L2RNAi; offspring. Due to the en-GAL4 parents containing
the CyO marker making them unsuitable for measurements the
;UAS-dis3L2RNAi; parents were used as controls.
For the experiments presented in Fig. 7, dis3L2 was knocked
down in pcm mutant backgrounds. In the hypomorphic experi-
ments (pcm5) the ;UAS-dis3L2RNAi; and ;;69B-GAL4 parents
served as controls (pcmWT). The pcm5 ﬂies carried the genotype

pcm5Dis3L2KD(pcm5 ;UAS-dis3L2RNAi/C; 69B-GAL4/C) wings
were compared to pcm5, pcmWT and Dis3L2KD (;UAS-dis3L2RNAi/
C ; 69B-GAL4/C) alone wings. We used the same approach with
the null mutant (pcm14) experiments. pcmWT larvae contained the
isogenic control for pcm14 (50E) and the UAS-dis3L2RNAi insertion
(50E ; UAS-dis3L2RNAi;). Similarly, the pcm14 larvae also carried
the UAS-dis3L2RNAi insertion (pcm14/Y ; UAS-dis3L2RNAi;). dis3L2
was knocked down in a pcm14 mutant background as follows
(pcm14/Y; UAS-dis3L2RNAi/C ; 69B-GAL4/C). dis3L2 knockdown
was also performed in the control, 50E background where 50E;
UAS-dis3L2RNAi/C ; 69B-GAL4/C wings were assessed. There was
no signiﬁcant difference between 50E; UAS-dis3L2RNAi/C ; 69B-
GAL4/C and ; UAS-dis3L2RNAi/C ; 69B-GAL4/C wings.
GAL80ts experiment
; tub-GAL80ts; 69B-GAL4 homozygous females were crossed to ;
UAS-dis3L2RNAi; males and left to mate for 2 d at the appropri-
ate temperature in addition to parental controls for all time
points (19C for all developmental timings except the positive
control at 29C). Flies were tipped into new vials for 8 hour egg
lays. Vials for both the parental controls and the ; UAS-dis3-
L2RNAi/GAL80ts ; 69B-GAL4/C ﬂies were moved from 19C to
29C at the required times for each developmental stage taking
into account a 24-32hr perdurance. Each comparison between
knockdown and controls was made speciﬁcally between those
for each time point.
Wing mounting and measurement
Flies were aged to between 1 and 2 days old for all measure-
ment experiments. A single wing (the ‘left-hand’ wing) was cut
from each ﬂy using microscissors and stored in isopropanol for
1 hour before being mounted in DPX (Sigma cat. no. 06522).
For all experiments the controls represent the mean wing area
of the parental controls together with an EGFPRNAi driven by
the same GAL4 drivers. All results shown were obtained with
male wings, however female wings also showed the same phe-
notypes. Mounted wings were measured using Axiovision 4.7
on an Axioplan microscope (Carl Zeiss). UAS-EGFPRNAi was
driven by both 69B-GAL4 and nub-GAL4 and when normalized
to ﬂy mass they were not signiﬁcantly larger the parental
controls.
Disc dissection, mounting and measurement
Wing imaginal discs were dissected from late L3 larvae in PBS. Late
L3 larvae were staged by the addition of bromophenol blue to the
food (0.05%) followed by selection of larvae that had cleared the
dyed food from their gut. Dissected discs were mounted on Poly-L-
1296
B. P. TOWLER ET AL.
Lysine slides and mounted in 85% glycerol. Disc areas were mea-
sured using Axiovision 4.7 on an Axioplan microscope (Carl Zeiss).
Immunocytochemistry
Immunocytochemistry was performed essentially as described in38
on late L3 wing imaginal discs. Images were taken with a Leica SP8
confocal microscope. Anti-Phosphohistone H3 (Cell Signaling, cat
no. 9701) was used at 1:300 dilution. Cy3-conjugated monoclonal
Donkey anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody was used at 1:400
dilution (Jackson ImmunoResearch, cat. no.715-165-151).
Calculation of the mitotic index
The number of nuclei undergoing mitosis were counted using
the ImageJ plugin DeadEasy MitoGlia.39 All discs were stained
with anti-Phosphohistone H3 as above under the same condi-
tions. The mitotic index was then calculated for each disc by
dividing the number of cells in M phase by the area of the disc.
RNA extraction and qRT-PCR
RNA extractions were performed using a miRNeasy RNA
extraction kit (Qiagen, cat. no. 217084), with on-column DNAse
digestion (Qiagen, cat. no. 79254). RNA concentrations were
measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo
Scientiﬁc). When examining wing imaginal discs at least 30
imaginal discs were collected for each biological replicate.
For qRT-PCR, 500ng of total RNA was converted to cDNA
in duplicate using a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcrip-
tion Kit (Life Technologies, cat. no. 4368814) with random pri-
mers or oligo(dT) primers. A control “no RT” reaction
(without enzyme) was performed in parallel to conﬁrm that all
genomic DNA had been degraded. qRT-PCR was performed
on each cDNA replicate in duplicate (i.e. Four technical repli-
cates), using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix, No AmpEr-
ase UNG (Life Technologies, cat. no. 4324018) and an
appropriate TaqMan assay (Life Technologies). For custom
pre-mRNA assays, the pre-mRNA sequence of the desired tar-
get area was submitted to Life Technologies’ web-based Custom
TaqMan Assay Design Tool as in22 (Fig. S12). RpL32 (Rp49)
gene was used for normalization.
RNA-seq analysis and selection of consistently changed
genes
RNA extraction was performed as above from 60 wandering L3
wing imaginal discs. RNA integrity was checked using an Agi-
lent 2100 Bioanalyzer. 3mg of total RNA per replicate was sent
to Oxford Gene Technology for sample preparation and
sequencing. Libraries were poly(A) selected and then were run
on a single HiSeq2000 lane using TruSeq v3 chemistry (Illu-
mina) generating between 12 and 15 million paired end reads
of 100bp per sample. The RNA-seq data has been deposited in
the ArrayExpress repository under the accession number E-
MTAB-4545.
Sequencing adaptors were identiﬁed using FastQC c0.11.2
(http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/)
and removed using Scythe v0.993b (https://github.com/vsbuf
falo/scythe). Further quality control and read trimming was
achieved using Sickle v1.29 (https://github.com/najoshi/sickle).
The remaining high quality reads were mapped to the Drosoph-
ila melanogaster genome from FlyBase r6.0140 using TopHat
v2.0.12.41 Differential expression was completed and normal-
ized FKPM values were generated using the Cufﬂinks pipe-
line.42 Alignment results and non-default parameters used
during the analysis are shown in Fig. S4.
Due to the knockdown replicates being in duplicate the statis-
tical output from Cufﬂinks could not be used. Therefore strin-
gent ﬁltering was applied. Only genes showing a fold change of
1.5-fold when compared between each knockdown and paren-
tal control replicate were selected as misexpressed genes. The
Cuffdiff output for the misexpressed genes can be found in Sup-
plemental File 1. Only those with an average fragments per kilo-
base per million (FPKM) of 0.3 where considered for validation
by qRT-PCR due to the difﬁculty of reliably detecting very lowly
expressed genes by qRT-PCR. The FPKM cut-off of 0.3 was cho-
sen because this threshold has been used previously43,44 and it
provided results which are reliable enough to be veriﬁed by qRT-
PCR. Those showing the highest reliable fold changes together
with a suitable average FPKM were selected for veriﬁcation.
Statistical tests
All statistical analyses were performed in either R v3.1.2 or
GraphPad Prism 6. Two-sided 2-sample t-tests were used to
compare the means of single test groups to single control
groups. If multiple comparisons were required, a one-way
ANOVA was performed with a post-test to compare the means
of each possible pair of samples.
Disclosure of potential conﬂicts of interest
No potential conﬂicts of interest were disclosed.
