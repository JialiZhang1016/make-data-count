Abstract 
Background:  Biofilms are cell communities wherein cells are embedded in a self-produced extracellular polymeric 
substances (EPS). The biofilm of Clostridium acetobutylicum confers the cells superior phenotypes and has been exten-
sively exploited to produce a variety of liquid biofuels and bulk chemicals. However, little has been known about the 
physiology of C. acetobutylicum in biofilm as well as the composition and biosynthesis of the EPS. Thus, this study is 
focused on revealing the cell physiology and EPS composition of C. acetobutylicum biofilm.
Results:  Here, we revealed a novel lifestyle of C. acetobutylicum in biofilm: elimination of sporulation and vegetative 
growth. Extracellular polymeric substances and wire-like structures were also observed in the biofilm. Furthermore, for 
the first time, the biofilm polysaccharides and proteins were isolated and characterized. The biofilm contained three 
heteropolysaccharides. The major fraction consisted of predominantly glucose, mannose and aminoglucose. Also, a 
great variety of proteins including many non-classically secreted proteins moonlighting as adhesins were found con-
siderably present in the biofilm, with GroEL, a S-layer protein and rubrerythrin being the most abundant ones.
Conclusions:  This study evidenced that vegetative C. acetobutylicum cells rather than commonly assumed spore-
forming cells were essentially the solvent-forming cells. The abundant non-classically secreted moonlighting proteins 
might be important for the biofilm formation. This study provides the first physiological and molecular insights into C. 
acetobutylicum biofilm which should be valuable for understanding and development of the biofilm-based processes.

Background
Microbial cells could synthesize extracellular poly-
meric substances (EPS) to build biofilm communities 
with enhanced survival and metabolic capacities [1]. 
In natural settings, biofilms are commonly formed by 
cells attached to surfaces or interfaces, like the sur-
faces of water pipes, stones in a river, and indwelling 
devices in hospital patients. In laboratory, biofilms 
are usually attached to the inside wall of incubators, 
grown on agar plates or static liquid surfaces [2], and 
their formation could often be facilitated by solid car-
riers submerged in culture media, such as cotton fibre, 
plastic, stainless steel, glass or clay brick [3, 4]. Some 
nutritional factors were shown to be important for bio-
film formation by some species. For some prokaryotes 
like Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
and P. fluorescens, iron limitation repressed biofilm 
formation while high iron rescued biofilm formation 
[5, 6]. In Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp. and anaero-
bic sludge communities, low-nutrient media (e.g.,

glucose-minimum medium, minimum-salts medium, 
media with relatively less peptone or a high C/N ratio) 
appeared to favor EPS production and biofilm forma-
tion [7–9]. As a multicellular form of microbial life, 
biofilms could exhibit emergent properties that are 
quite distinct from those of free-living cells and have 
attracted increasing attention in biotechnological 
processes as well as in medical processes [1]. More 
and more biofilms are engineered as cell factories for 
biomanufacturing [10]. One canonical example is the 
biofilm of solventogenic Clostridium acetobutylicum 
which is an important industrial platform capable of 
producing a range of biofuels and bulk chemicals [11]. 
It was shown that butanol tolerance of C. acetobutyli-
cum cells in biofilm was three orders of magnitude 
higher than that of planktonic cells under certain con-
ditions [12]. Operated in a continuous mode, Clostrid-
ium biofilms increased the productivity by almost 
50-fold [4, 13]. Enhanced metabolism of pentose as 
well as hexose and enhanced solvent biosynthesis were 
also extensively demonstrated for C. acetobutylicum 
biofilm [14–16].
In general, superior phenotypes (such as the 
improved tolerance and metabolic activities) of EPS-
encased biofilm cells could be attributed to two 
aspects: genetic regulation and EPS architecture. Liv-
ing together in biofilms, cells tend to exhibit a different 
pattern of gene expression. Some genes are repressed 
or activated, thus cellular structure and functions are 
modulated [17, 18]. On the other hand, highly hydrated 
EPS matrix can be a protective barrier and provides 
cells with a favourable microenvironment. EPS plays an 
important role in exclusion of toxic substances [17, 19]. 
It keeps cells in close proximity and enables the devel-
opment of high-density cell communities with intense 
cell–cell communication and cooperation [19, 20]. EPS 
matrix also provides excellent conditions for retention 
of extracellular proteins, functioning as an enzyme res-
ervoir for external processes [1].
However, so far little has been known about C. ace-
tobutylicum biofilm. Despite the observation of C. 
acetobutylicum biofilm under various conditions, the 
underlying molecular basis and regulatory processes 
remain to be explored [21]. Deciphering the EPS matrix 
and cell physiology in the biofilm will be important for 
optimization and control of biofilm-based processes. 
Recently we reported the first transcriptomic study of 
C. acetobutylicum biofilm [22] and revealed that heter-
ogeneity of C. acetobutylicum EPS conferred improved 
resistance to harsh environments [23]. In this study, we 
will further shed light on C. acetobutylicum biofilm by 
investigating the cell physiology and EPS composition 
in the biofilm.
Methods
Culture and medium
Cultures of C. acetobutylicum B3 (CGMCC 5234) were 
grown in modified P2 medium containing 10  g/L glu-
cose as the sole carbohydrate source for seed culture. 
Fermentation experiments were performed anaerobi-
cally in 2-L stainless steel columns containing 1.5 L of 
P2 medium (glucose 60  g/L; ­K2HPO4 0.5  g/L; ­KH2PO4 
0.5  g/L; ­CH3COONH4 2.2  g/L; ­MgSO4·7H2O 0.2  g/L; 
­MnSO4·H2O 0.01  g/L; NaCl 0.01  g/L; ­FeSO4·7H2O 
0.01 g/L; p-aminobenzoic acid 1 mg/L; thiamine 1 mg/L; 
biotin 0.01 mg/L) at 37 °C with initial inoculum 10%(v/v). 
Cotton towel was used to facilitate the formation of bio-
film and continuous culture was performed with broth 
replacement every 12 h, see our previous work for details 
[12, 22].
Quantification of biofilm formation
Each piece of cotton towel (2 cm × 3 cm) with attached 
biofilm was taken from fermenters at predetermined 
time, immersed in 20 mL of 0.1 M NaOH (the mass of 
NaOH solute was calculated as W1) and vortexed to 
completely dissolve the biofilm. Then, the piece was 
removed and rinsed twice with a total of 40 mL of pure 
water. All the volumes were mixed together and the total 
volume was determined. Then, 3 mL of the mixture was 
dried and weighed to deduce the total dry weight (W2) 
of the mixture. Biofilm formation was quantified as 
(W2 − W1)/(2 cm × 3 cm).
Transcriptomic analysis
To collect biofilm cells for transcriptomic analysis, pieces 
of cotton towel were harvested from the fermenter typi-
cally at 6 h after each broth replacement and rinsed twice 
with PBS buffer (137  mM NaCl, 2.7  mM KCl, 8  mM 
­Na2HPO4 and 2 mM ­KH2PO4, pH 7.4, 4 °C) to remove 
contaminating planktonic cells. Then, the cotton towel 
was submerged in 15-mL PBS buffer and the biofilm was 
scraped off the cotton towel. The resulting suspension 
was centrifuged at 8000×g for 6 min at 4 °C to pellet the 
biofilm cells. All the cells were frozen immediately using 
liquid nitrogen and then stored at − 80 °C prior to RNA 
extraction. RNA extraction and transcription analysis 
were performed as previously described [22]. Resulting 
microarray data were uploaded to the Gene Expression 
Omnibus (GEO) database under Accession Number 
GSE72765. Hierarchical clustering was performed using 
R-software and clusters were visualized with Tree-view 
[22].
Microscopy
Light microscopy was used for morphological obser-
vation. Each piece of cotton towel (approximately 
Page 3 of 13
Liu et al. Biotechnol Biofuels          (2018) 11:315 
2 cm × 3 cm) with attached biofilm was taken from fer-
menters at predetermined time points, immersed in 
0.1 M NaOH at 4 °C for 10 min and vortexed to com-
pletely disperse cells within the biofilm. Then, 50 ul of 
suspension was transferred to a microscope slide and 
air-dried. Safranin O was used as a fluorescence dye that 
can be excited with green light [24]. It is well known for 
nuclear staining and was also reported to stain mucin, 
cartilage, starch and plant tissues [25]. In this study, it 
also differentially stained cells and endospores under 
light microscopy. Cells were stained with 0.5% safranin O 
for 30 s, washed gently with water and then air-dried for 
light microscopy. As the real production system with cot-
ton towel as biofilm carrier was not suitable for detailed 
observation of the biofilm, fluorescence microscopy using 
microscope slides as biofilm carriers was used to observe 
the biofilm in detail. Microscope slides were immersed in 
100-mL Duran bottles containing 50 mL of fermentation 
broth at the time of inoculation (10%, v/v). All the bottles 
were kept static in an anaerobic system (Whitley DG250 
workstation, Don Whitley Scientific Limited, UK) at 
37 °C. After predetermined time intervals, the slides were 
withdrawn from the bottles, rinsed twice with PBS buffer 
(pH 7.4), then air-dried in the anaerobic system. Samples 
were stained with 0.5% safranin O as described above 
before imaging in the green channel in a Leica DM2500 
microscope.
Extraction of polysaccharides and proteins from C. 
acetobutylicum biofilm
Various methods were tried to dissolve C. acetobutyli-
cum biofilm, including EDTA treatment, hot water treat-
ment, sonication and enzymatic digestion. Usually, these 
methods could physically or chemically dissolve biofilm 
matrixes and have been commonly investigated for EPS 
extraction [26]. However, none of these methods could 
effectively dissolve the C. acetobutylicum biofilm except 
using NaOH (Additional file 1: Figure S1). The superna-
tant proteins and polysaccharides extracted by NaOH 
were much more than those from other methods, while 
the DNA ratio which could be an indicator of cell lysis 
was adequately low (Additional file 1: Table S1). Biofilm 
attached on cotton towel was immersed in 0.1 M NaOH 
at 4 °C for 30 min. This would get the biofilm matrix dis-
solved completely and quickly. The suspension was then 
centrifuged (10,000g) at 4 °C for 10 min to pellet cells. To 
the supernatant containing soluble EPS, 1.5 volume of 
ethanol was added to precipitate polysaccharides. Precip-
itated polysaccharides were collected through centrifuga-
tion and the supernatant was adjusted to pH 4.2 and kept 
overnight at 4 °C to precipitate proteins. Interference of 
possible cell lysis on the process was excluded because 
cells were all apparently intact after the short treatment 
with NaOH as was confirmed by microscopy. Also, con-
trol experiments solely with an equal volume of C. ace-
tobutylicum cells going through the same procedures did 
not yield apparent sediments.
Isolation of polysaccharides
An aliquot of 0.5 g wet polysaccharide extract was dis-
solved in 35  mL of 0.1  M NaOH. The polysaccharide 
solution was filtered through a 0.45-µm membrane filter 
(Fisher Scientific). Polysaccharides were isolated with the 
Q-Sepharose fast flow (QFF) chromatography column 
(AKTA, GE Healthcare, USA), eluted with a step gradi-
ent of NaCl (dissolved in 0.1 M NaOH) in 0, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 
and 0.8 M steps, at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min. Eluent was 
monitored at 280 nm and carbohydrate content of each 
fraction (200 µL) was determined according to the phe-
nol–sulphuric acid method [27].
Monosaccharide composition analysis
The 1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolone (PMP) derivatiza-
tion method [28] was used to analyze monosaccharide 
composition. Each polysaccharide (2 mg) was hydrolyzed 
with 2 M trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) at 105 °C for 3 h. TFA 
was evaporated by adding methanol under reduced pres-
sure. The hydrolysis product was derivatized with PMP 
in 0.3  M NaOH for 1  h at 70  °C, and then neutralized 
with HCl. The derivatives were analyzed using a Thermo 
C18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm) coupled to an Agilent 
HPLC–DAD at 245 nm, at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min of 
mobile phase: phosphate buffer (0.1  mol/L, pH 7.0)/
CH3CN = 83/17 (v/v). Monosaccharide composition and 
the molar ratio analysis were carried out by comparing 
the retention times and peak areas with those of mono-
saccharide standards.
Mass spectrometric analysis of extracellular proteins
Proteins precipitated after the pH adjustment were sent 
to Shanghai Boyuan Biological Technology CO., LTD 
(Shanghai, China) for LC–MS/MS analysis. Proteins 
isolated by two-dimensional (2D) SDS-PAGE were ana-
lyzed using an ABI 4800 Plus MALDI TOF/TOF system 
(Life Technologies). Protein identification was performed 
using MASCOT 2.3 (http://www.matri​xscie​nce.com/, 
Matrix Science, UK) against the NCBI-Clostridium ace-
tobutylicum database using a significance threshold of 
p < 0.05.
Results
Sporulation and morphological changes of biofilm cells
Biofilm formation by C. acetobutylicum in fermenters 
during continuous cultivation was quantified. Accumula-
tion of biofilm was most apparent during day 3 and day 4. 
The biofilm could be built up with a maximum dry weight 
Page 4 of 13
Liu et al. Biotechnol Biofuels          (2018) 11:315 
of 28 mg/cm2 on the surface of cotton towel (Fig. 1). It 
was found that during continuous cultivation of C. ace-
tobutylicum biofilm, the cells eventually eliminated spor-
ulation and displayed a vegetative growth. As shown in 
Fig. 2, swollen clostridial-form cells first appeared at 18 h. 
These cells are to be the mother cells for spores. With the 
sporulation, fore spores were formed at 30  h. The final 
mature spores were released and peaked at 42  h, after 
which they disappeared rapidly. By 102 h, spores could 
hardly be observed, leaving almost exclusively vegetative 
cells. At the same time, the vegetative cells underwent 
significant morphological changes: from short single cells 
to long-chain cells. The long chains of cells were observed 
from 66 h, apparent at 102 h, and predominantly present 
in the biofilm after 150 h with a length around 100 µm.
Decreased expression of sporulation genes in biofilm cells
Inspired by the elimination of sporulation in the bio-
film cells during long-term cultivation, expression of 
sporulation-related genes was investigated. In general, 
expression of the genes responsible for spore forma-
tion was apparently down-regulated in the biofilm over 
time (Fig.  3). Of the sporulation regulators in C. ace-
tobutylicum, the gene encoding σK (sigK, CA_C1689) 
was downregulated over time by eightfold. The most 
down-regulated genes were those involved in spore coat 
synthesis (CA_C0613-0614, CA_C1335, CA_C1337-
1338, CA_C2808-2910, CA_C3317), which decreased 
over time by 6- to 24-fold. An operon CA_C2086-2093 
related to stage III sporulation was down-regulated 6- 
to 12-fold. The small, acid-soluble proteins (SASP) that 
are used to coat DNA in spores (encoded by CA_C1487

and CA_C1522) were also significantly down-regulated 
by 48-fold (p < 0.01; Student t test), and the CA_C2365 
was down-regulated by 200-fold. Overall, the decreased 
expression of sporulation-related genes over time was 
consistent with the elimination of sporulation in the 
biofilm.
EPS and wire‑like structures in C. acetobutylicum biofilm
EPS and wire-like structures of C. acetobutylicum bio-
film were observed. As shown in Fig.  4, at the early 
stage of biofilm development (4 h), cells were all bur-
ied in a gel-like extracellular matrix (as indicated by the 
blurred area in the image) which was typically excreted 
by the cells to help adhere onto surfaces. Then it devel-
oped into a three-dimensional, high-density cell colony 
(16 h). At the edges of the colonies, wire-like structures 
could be clearly observed. The wires were surprisingly 
long (could be more than 50 µm) and could be cross-
connected. With the development, the wires were even-
tually imbedded in cells aggregates (28 h). At the late 
stage (40  h), EPS pellicles were also shown. In recent 
years, a kind of “nanowire” structure has been reported 
for some bacterial biofilms and was supposed to func-
tion in extracellular electron transport [29]. Whether 
the wire structures observed here are similar to the 
nanowires and what their roles are in C. acetobutylicum 
biofilm remain to be investigated.

Characterization of C. acetobutylicum biofilm 
polysaccharides
After polysaccharides and proteins in C. acetobutyli-
cum biofilm were extracted, the polysaccharides were 
further isolated by anion exchange chromatography 
(Fig.  5). Three polysaccharides were obtained which 
were designated SM1, SM2, and SM3 according to their 
elution order. A peak at 280 nm occurred concurrently 
with each of the polysaccharide peaks, indicating possi-
ble presence of polysaccharide-associated proteins. The 
SM1 comprised the largest fraction (53%, w/w) of the 
polysaccharides, followed by SM2 (26%, w/w) and SM3 
(21%, w/w). SM1 was also the most purified polysac-
charide as indicated by a much smaller peak at 280 nm 
(Fig. 5).
Analysis of monosaccharide composition showed that 
all the three polysaccharides were heteropolysaccharides 
with glucose as the primary component (Table 1). SM2 
and SM3 were very similar in both of monosaccharide 
type and molar ratio, consisting of glucose (47–53%, 
molar ratio, the same hereinafter), mannose (13–15%), 
rhamnose (10–16%), galactose (9–10%), aminoglucose 
(7–9%), and a little ribose (4–5%). Compared to SM2 
and SM3, the SM1 polysaccharide consisted of more glu-
cose (58%), mannose (21%), and aminoglucose (13%), but 
much less rhamnose (0.8%), galactose (0.8%) and ribose 
(0.4%). SM1 also consisted of unique galacturonic acid 
(5.5%). The presence of uronic acid might explain why the 
C. acetobutylicum biofilm matrix was alkali soluble.
Identification of C. acetobutylicum biofilm proteins
Proteins extracted from the C. acetobutylicum biofilm 
were identified by LC–MS/MS. The proteins were next 
ranked according to their emPAI (exponentially modified 
protein abundance index) which reflects their relative 
abundance [30]. Table 2 lists the Top 30 abundant pro-
teins of C. acetobutylicum biofilm. Strikingly, most of the 
proteins are commonly known as physiological process 
related proteins, especially the molecular chaperones and 
stress proteins. The three most abundant proteins were 
GroEL, surface layer (S-layer) protein and rubrerythrin, 
which typically functions as molecular chaperone, struc-
ture protein and oxidative stress protein, respectively. 
Surprisingly, many of the proteins are typically known 
as intracellular proteins such as the enzymes normally 
functioning in central metabolism, glyceraldehyde-
3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), triose phosphate 
isomerase, pyruvate: ferredoxin oxidoreductase, electron 
transfer flavoprotein and alcohol dehydrogenase. Mean-
while, the biofilm proteins were isolated by 2D gel elec-
trophoresis and major protein spots were identified by 
MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. The major pro-
teins identified on 2D gel were well included in the Top 
30 abundant proteins identified by LC–MS/MS, and

the spots of the three most abundant proteins, GroEL, 
S-layer protein and rubrerythrin were indeed the most 
distinct protein spots on 2D gel (Fig. 6).
In fact, most of the C. acetobutylicum biofilm proteins 
identified here have been recognized as a kind of non-
classically secreted proteins that do not contain known 
sequence motifs for secretion or anchoring onto the 
cell surface [31, 32]. A great number of these proteins 
have been found to be “moonlight proteins” that have 
a canonical biochemical function inside the cell and 
perform a second biochemical function on the cell sur-
face or extracellularly [33, 34]. Table 3 lists the proteins 
(from the Top 30 abundant proteins list) that have been 
reported as non-classically secreted proteins or moon-
lighting proteins. Obviously, many proteins with canoni-
cal function in central metabolism, chaperone activity, or

protein synthesis and nucleic acid stability could moon-
light as bacterial adhesins and interact with the environ-
ment. While these proteins were abundant in the biofilm, 
no apparent regulation of their gene transcription was 
observed (Additional file 2: Sheet 3).
Discussion
C. acetobutylicum has attracted considerable inter-
est due to its unique capability of biosynthesizing a 
range of liquid fuels and bulk chemicals that are funda-
mentally important to human society. It has been long 
accepted that sporulating clostridial form of C. aceto-
butylicum cells is the solvent-forming phenotype, that 
is, solventogenesis is coupled to sporulation. However, 
Tracy and his co-workers observed a stronger correla-
tion between solvent production and the vegetative cell 
type than the clostridial-form type based on flow cytom-
etry assisted cell-sorting techniques. They also demon-
strated that a sigF mutant blocked sporulation but still 
produced comparable solvent in batch fermentation [71, 
72]. Despite this, the view that solventogenesis is coupled 
to sporulation is still prevailing in the field [73, 74]. Here, 
our results clearly showed that C. acetobutylicum could 
eliminate sporulation and display vegetative growth in 
biofilm over time. In this way, instead of being impaired, 
the solvent production was greatly improved [12, 22].

Therefore, it is plausible that sporulation and solven-
togenesis can be uncoupled in C. acetobutylicum. This 
is of particular importance, because it would encourage 
researchers to develop long-term continuous cultiva-
tion processes. Besides elimination of sporulation, C. 
acetobutylicum biofilm cells also exhibited significant 
morphological changes. The prolonged chain-like mor-
phology observed for C. acetobutylicum biofilm cells was 
also observed for Bacillus subtilis biofilm cells. In B. sub-
tilis, a transcriptional regulator SinR represses the genes 
responsible for EPS production and promotes cell sepa-
ration and motility. During biofilm development, SinR 
activity is antagonized. Low SinR activity results in EPS 
production and loss of cell motility. Thus, motile single 
cells switch to long chains of nonmotile cells [75]. Con-
sidering the presence of SinR in C. acetobutylicum, this is 
probably also the case in C. acetobutylicum.
Despite the fact that C. acetobutylicum biofilm has 
been extensively exploited for producing industrial prod-
ucts [4, 12, 16, 21], the biosynthetic process and molec-
ular composition of C. acetobutylicum biofilm remain 
completely unknown. Here, for the first time isolated 
polysaccharides and proteins from C. acetobutylicum 
biofilm were reported. C. acetobutylicum biofilm con-
tained three polysaccharides which were all heteropoly-
saccharides. Recently, a polysaccharide separated from 
C. acetobutylicum culture supernatant was reported [76]. 
Consistent with our results, the supernatant polysaccha-
ride was also a heteropolysaccharide and its monosac-
charide composition seemed similar to those of the SM2 
and SM3. While the supernatant polysaccharide was 
characterized with glucose (34%, molar ratio), rhamnose 
(40%), mannose (13%) and galactose (10%) as its primary 
monosaccharides, the SM2 and SM3 characterized here 
also consisted of glucose (47–53%), rhamnose (10–16%), 
mannose (13–21%) and galactose (9–10%) as their pri-
mary monosaccharides (Table 1), although the monosac-
charide ratio differed. However, the polysaccharide SM1 
that represented the major polysaccharide in C. aceto-
butylicum biofilm had a more distinct composition: it 
contained predominantly glucose (58%), mannose (21%), 
and aminoglucose (13%). Altogether, it seemed that C.

acetobutylicum liked to produce a variety of heteropoly-
saccharides varying in monosaccharide composition. In 
addition, the biofilm polysaccharides, especially the SM1, 
proved hard to re-dissolve after lyophilization. Also, they 
were possibly associated with some non-carbohydrate 
substances. Despite our try of various protein removal 
methods, they still defied 1H-NMR analysis.
Strikingly, a great variety of proteins were found abun-
dantly present in C. acetobutylicum biofilm. One of the 
most abundant proteins was a protein annotated as puta-
tive S-layer protein (Table 2; Fig. 6). The gene encoding 
this protein is designated CEA_G3563 in C. acetobu-
tylicum EA2018 and SMB_G3598 in C. acetobutylicum 
DSM 1731. In both strains, it is located in an operon 
together with and downstream of an S-layer protein 
encoding gene [77]. It shows 81% sequence identity to a 
S-layer protein from C. felsineum DSM 794 (Sequence 
ID: WP_077894211), but both have been poorly stud-
ied. S-layers are crystalline monomolecular assemblies 
of protein or glycoprotein, which represent one of the 
most common cell envelope structures in bacteria [78]. 
In Clostridium difficile, S-layer proteins were demon-
strated essential for biofilm formation perhaps due to the 
fact that S-layer is essential for anchoring cell wall associ-
ated proteins that are required for adhesion during bio-
film formation [79]. Studies also showed that S-layer was 
required for normal growth in C. difficile [80, 81], while 
a non-matured S-layer protein induced the apparition of 
a bigger biofilm [82]. Except the putative S-layer protein, 
most of the C. acetobutylicum proteins were typically 
intracellular proteins (Tables 2, 3). It has previously been 
reported that a variety of Gram-positive bacteria, such 
as S. aureus and B. subtilis, release intracellular proteins 
into the external environment during stationary phase 
[83, 84]. These proteins are considered to be secreted in a 
non-classical pathway and some of them (e.g., the GroEL) 
have been extensively found to moonlight as adhesins 
and contribute to the biofilm formation [32, 33, 84]. For 
instance, it was shown that deletion of GroEL-phospho-
rylating PrkC in Bacillus anthracis abrogated biofilm for-
mation, while overexpression of GroEL led to increased 
biofilm formation [85, 86]. Another intracellular protein 
abundant in the biofilm is a rubrerythrin encoded by 
rbr3B (CA_C3597). In this rubrerythrin, the order of the 
two functional domains is reversed compared to normal 
rubrerythrins [87]. Although this rubrerythrin has been 
demonstrated to be involved in ­H2O2 and ­O2 detoxifica-
tion, its role in biofilm remains to be studied.
Besides the non-classical secretion, the abundance of 
intracellular proteins could also be a result of cell lysis 
inside the biofilm during long-term development. While 
a biofilm could persistently exist, a subpopulation of the

cells inside is likely lysed due to various mechanisms 
[88]. The biofilm matrix could act as a recycling center by 
keeping the components of lysed cells available [19, 88]. 
A biofilm-forming mechanism was recently proposed 
using Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
biofilm as a model [83, 89]. In these models, cytoplasmic 
proteins that were released from cells or cell lysate pro-
teins could associate with the cell surface in response to 
decreasing pH during biofilm formation. Considering 
the presence of abundant cytoplasmic proteins in the C. 
acetobutylicum biofilm as well as a low pH level (usually 
around pH 4.2) during C. acetobutylicum fermentation, 
this mechanism also be plausible for C. acetobutylicum 
biofilm.
Conclusions
Clostridium acetobutylicum biofilm cells eliminated spor-
ulation and performed vegetative growth over time, indi-
cating that vegetative C. acetobutylicum cells rather than 
the spore-forming cells were the solvent-forming cells. 
EPS and wire-like structures were observed. The bio-
film contained three heteropolysaccharides. The major 
fraction consisted of predominantly glucose, mannose 
and aminoglucose. A variety of proteins including non-
classically secreted proteins were present in the biofilm, 
with GroEL, a S-layer protein and rubrerythrin being the 
most abundant. Of these proteins, many proteins such 
as GroEL, Ef-Tu and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehy-
drogenase could moonlight as adhesins which might 
contribute to the biofilm formation. This study provides 
important insights into C. acetobutylicum biofilm. Future 
studies should genetically manipulate the main compo-
nents to elucidate their specific roles in C. acetobutyli-
cum biofilm.
