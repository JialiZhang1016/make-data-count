Abstract
Background: Basic emergency obstetric and newborn care (BEmONC) is a primary health care level initiative promoted
in low- and middle-income countries to reduce maternal and newborn mortality. Tailored support, including BEmONC
training to providers, mentoring and monitoring through supportive supervision, provision of equipment and supplies,
strengthening referral linkages, and improving infection-prevention practice, was provided in a package of interventions
to 134 health centers, covering 91 rural districts of Ethiopia to ensure timely BEmONC care. In recent years, there has been
a growing interest in measuring program implementation strength to evaluate public health gains. To assess the
effectiveness of the BEmONC initiative, this study measures its implementation strength and examines the effect of its
variability across intervention health centers on the rate of facility deliveries and the met need for BEmONC.
Methods: Before and after data from 134 intervention health centers were collected in April 2013 and July 2015. A
BEmONC implementation strength index was constructed from seven input and five process indicators measured
through observation, record review, and provider interview; while facility delivery rate and the met need for expected
obstetric complications were measured from service statistics and patient records. We estimated the dose–response
relationships between outcome and explanatory variables of interest using regression methods.
Results: The BEmONC implementation strength index score, which ranged between zero and 10, increased statistically
significantly from 4.3 at baseline to 6.7 at follow-up (p < .05). Correspondingly, the health center delivery rate significantly
increased from 24% to 56% (p < .05). There was a dose–response relationship between the explanatory and outcome
variables. For every unit increase in BEmONC implementation strength score there was a corresponding average of 4.5
percentage points (95% confidence interval: 2.1–6.9) increase in facility-based deliveries; while a higher score for BEmONC
implementation strength of a health facility at follow-up was associated with a higher met need.

Conclusion: The BEmONC initiative was effective in improving institutional deliveries and may have also improved the
met need for BEmONC services. The BEmONC implementation strength index can be potentially used to monitor the
implementation of BEmONC interventions.

Background
Globally, about 45% of maternal deaths and 36% of neo-
natal deaths occur during the first 24 h after birth [1, 2].
Maternal and newborn deaths related to the perinatal
period are largely preventable, and most life-threatening
conditions are treatable if skilled health care is provided
during the intrapartum and early postnatal periods [3–5]
at the primary health care level [6–8]. However, in low-
and middle-income countries (LMIC), where maternal
and neonatal mortality is high, the availability, accessibil-
ity, and use of proven life-saving interventions for the
treatment of obstetric complications are low [9, 10].
Ethiopia made progress in improving maternal and
child health during the Millennium Development Goal
era from 1990 to 2015. The maternal mortality rate
(MMR) dropped by 72% from 1250 to 353 per 100,000
live births, while child mortality decreased by two-thirds
from 205 to 59 per 1000 live births [10, 11]. The reduc-
tion in the neonatal mortality rate (NMR) has been slow
during that period and is currently 28 deaths per 1000
live births, accounting for 47% of all under-5 years mor-
tality [11]. Despite this decline, Ethiopia’s MMR is still
regarded as among the highest in the world [10]. More-
over, the coverage of skilled attendance at birth and the
met need for obstetric and newborn care are low [12,
13]. Committed to contribute toward achieving the ma-
ternal and newborn survival-related Sustainable Devel-
opment Goals (i.e., to reduce global MMR to less than
70 per 100,000 live births and NMR to at least as low as
12 per 1000 live births by 2030 [14, 15], the Health Sec-
tor Transformation Plan (HSTP) of Ethiopia targets to
reduce MMR to 199 per 100,000 live births and NMR to
10 per 1000 live births by 2020 [16].
One of the key strategies promoted to reduce both
maternal and newborn mortality in LMIC is the timely
access to comprehensive emergency obstetric and new-
born care (CEmONC) [5, 17], with the provision of at
least the basic emergency obstetric and newborn care
(BEmONC) (see Box 1 for definition) at the primary
health care level of a country’s health system [17]. To
track progress in monitoring this strategy, the availability
of BEmONC services, the proportion of all live births
taking place in facilities, and the met need for EmONC
are among the key indicators that have been developed
for the primary care level [17] (Table 1).
A systematic review of studies using quasi-experimental,
observational, and ecological designs demonstrates evi-
dence of the effectiveness of EmONC interventions in
reducing maternal mortality in LMIC [3]. A recent inter-
vention study in Ethiopia suggests that upgrading facilities
to provide life-saving interventions decreased the MMR
and improved facility delivery rate [18]. Similar studies
elsewhere demonstrate that implementation of EmONC
has significantly improved the facility delivery and the met
need for EmONC [19].
Despite the availability of evidence of the efficacy of
life-saving interventions to avert high rates of maternal
and newborn deaths [5, 20], there is little understanding
of how to deliver those interventions effectively [21–23].
Accordingly, intervention strategies need to be properly
evaluated to identify successful, evidence-based, low-cost
interventions, or implementation approaches that can be
scaled-up, to promote their sustainable integration into
health systems, and to ensure accountability to donors
for public health gains [22–24]. Measuring the strength
of program implementation is one of the evaluation
approaches that helps to understand which packages of
Table 1 Definition of BEmONC
Emergency obstetric and newborn care (EmONC) is defined as a set of
life-saving interventions, that treat the major obstetric and newborn
causes of morbidity and mortality. To assess the level of care, these
functions are classified as basic EmONC (BEmONC) or comprehensive
EmONC (CEmONC) levels of care.
BEmONC services comprise:
1) administration of parenteral antibiotics to prevent puerperal infection
or treat abortion complications;
2) administration of parenteral anticonvulsants for treatment of eclampsia
and preeclampsia;
3) administration of parenteral uterotonic drugs for postpartum
hemorrhage;
4) manual removal of the placenta;
5) assisted vaginal delivery (vacuum extractions);
6) removal of retained products of conception; and
7) neonatal resuscitation.
If a facility has provided all seven key BEmONC functions in the last
3 months, it is called a BEmONC facility.
CEmONC services comprise caesarean sections and blood transfusions,
in addition to BEmONC functions.

interventions are delivered effectively (and which are
not) and why some programs are effective and attribute
outcomes to program implementation characteristics
[23, 25, 26]. However, in LMIC, there is a gap between
knowledge of proven interventions and gains through
implementation variations [22].
Strengthening
the
health
care
system to
provide
BEmONC is a key priority for providing life-saving ser-
vices, especially in rural areas [12, 18, 27]. The Govern-
ment of Ethiopia took an initiative to improve access to
BEmONC services by upgrading the capability of health
centers at the country’s primary health care level. Meas-
uring the implementation strength of the BEmONC
package of interventions (i.e., the degree of functionality
of the different aspects of BEmONC) at the health cen-
ters in Ethiopia is essential to understanding which as-
pects of BEmONC care improved (and which did not).
Moreover, it also helped identify whether the improve-
ment in BEmONC was associated with an increase in
utilization of services for critical maternal and newborn
care practices. As such, the implementation variability of
BEmONC initiatives can be studied with the concept of
implementation strength to explore the association be-
tween the implementation strength and utilization of
facility delivery. It is hypothesized that higher implemen-
tation strength of the BEmONC score of primary level
facilities is associated with the utilization of facility deliv-
eries and the met need for BEmONC.
Most previous studies have focused on changes in the
uptake of EmONC, the variability of program inputs,
and
effectiveness
of
special
interventions
like
the
implementation of transport systems, emergency loans,
community financing, communications, or various com-
binations of these elements [18, 19, 28–30] on the up-
take of facility delivery and the met need for EmONC,
without distinguishing the level of care. Moreover, there
is little programmatic evidence of how implementation
variability affects the uptake of maternal and newborn
health services at the primary health care level. Thus,
this study examines the effectiveness of the BEmONC
initiative by analyzing the effect of facility inputs and the
process of service delivery as implementation strength
index score on the rate of facility deliveries and the met
need for BEmONC in rural health centers of Ethiopia.
Study settings
The Ethiopian primary health care system employs decen-
tralized governance structures where regions are divided
into zones, which are internally divided into districts. To
respond to its population needs, the Government of
Ethiopia has restructured its health service into a three-
tier system of care: primary, secondary, and tertiary [16].
Primary level health care, the major platform for health
service delivery at the grassroots level, in a rural district in
Ethiopia consists of one primary hospital with four or five
primary health care units (PHCUs). Each PHCU com-
prises a health center with five satellite health posts serv-
ing about 25,000 people in total. Health centers are staffed
with health officers, nurses, midwives, and laboratory
technicians to provide primarily preventive, curative, in-
patient and ambulatory services, treatment of common
psychiatric disorders, and dental services.
To reduce the high rate of maternal mortality in Ethiopia,
the Government expanded health centers to achieve a tar-
get of one health center providing all BEmONC functions
for every 25,000 population during the implementation of
Health Sector Development Plan IV from 2010 to 2015.
Moreover, the country sought to improve access to, and
utilization of, BEmONC services by mobilizing communi-
ties to encourage pregnant mothers to give birth in health
centers, expanding health centers, staffing health centers
with midwives to ensure BEmONC services are always
available, and providing ambulances to districts to mitigate
transportation barriers [31].
However, national evidence shows that most health
centers were weak in providing life-saving BEmONC
interventions, with only a few facilities providing all
BEmONC functions. In most health centers, drugs, equip-
ment, and supplies were missing, the centers were poorly
staffed, or staff lacked the skills to apply most BEmONC
functions. Moreover, the proportion of facility deliveries
and the met need for BEmONC were low [12, 13].
Strengthening health centers to provide all BEmONC
functions remains a challenge. This is particularly so in
rural health centers [32]. As such, the Federal Ministry of
Health has set targets for facility delivery coverage at 90%
and to enable all health centers to provide all BEmONC
functions by 2020 [16].
Methods
The BEmONC initiative
To upgrade the capability of health centers to provide
timely BEmONC, tailored support was provided to 134
health centers, covering 91 rural districts of Ethiopia dur-
ing the first phase of Ethiopia’s BEmONC-strengthening
initiative, which was initiated in April 2013. This included
BEmONC training to providers, mentoring and monitor-
ing through post-training follow-up, provision of equip-
ment and supplies, strengthening referral linkages, and
improving infection-prevention practice.
Study design
A before and after evaluation for the BEmONC interven-
tion included a cross-sectional survey conducted in April
2013 and July 2015, in 134 rural health centers in 91 dis-
tricts of four regions: Amhara, Oromia, the Southern Na-
tional, Nationalities, and Peoples’ Region, and Tigray. The
effectiveness of the BEmONC initiative was determined by

the dose–response relationships between BEmONC imple-
mentation strength (BIS) of the health centers and the out-
comes of interest.
Conceptual framework
A conceptual framework for measuring BIS was devel-
oped through a review of peer-reviewed and gray litera-
ture. Organizational structure (i.e., the resources of the
health care system) and processes of service delivery are
identified as components for measuring implementation
strength [17, 25, 33, 34]. The structural components,
well-documented in the literature, to provide quality
BEmONC are a functioning facility with a skilled health
service provider available around the clock and func-
tional and adequate supplies, equipment, drugs, and
infrastructure. An effective referral system is also critical
to ensure a woman reaches the facility in a timely man-
ner. The core elements of an effective referral system
include formalized communication and transport, suffi-
ciently resourced referral centers, active collaboration
across all referral levels, protocols for the referrer and
receiver, and accountability for providers’ performances,
coupled with supportive supervision [34]. With regard
to the process components, facilities must provide life-
saving interventions in a timely manner to respond to
women’s needs [8, 17, 35, 36]. In addition, the project
implementation pathway was analyzed by reviewing pro-
ject documents and the Project Management Plan. The
critical components necessary for measuring BIS in rural
health centers to improve the use of critical maternal
and newborn care services are 1) facilities’ emergency
readiness in terms of availability of services, human re-
sources, equipment, and drugs; 2) effective referral; 3)
the support system; and 4) adherence to basic life-saving
interventions and quality of care (Fig. 1).
Data
All 134 first-phase intervention health centers were vis-
ited during baseline and follow-up surveys. Data were
collected through interviews, observation, and a review
of patient records and service statistics. Data collectors
conducted interviews with the heads of the health cen-
ters and health care providers working in the maternity
units to gather information on the availability of equip-
ment and supplies, human resources, the performance
of BEmONC signal functions, and other maternal and
newborn health services. Observations were made to
assess the infrastructure and supplies available. Docu-
ments were reviewed to gather data on service statistics
and patient records, to assess utilization of services for
critical maternal, and newborn conditions. The survey
questionnaire and the dataset we used for this study are
presented as additional files (see Additional files 1 and 2).
Baseline data were collected using paper-based ques-
tionnaires and data were entered using Epi Info 7. The
quality assurance of data entry was ensured through ap-
propriate skip patterns and allowing only logical values
data entry. The data entry was done twice and both en-
tries were validated with each other to eliminate data
entry errors. In the follow-up survey, data were captured
using the Android mobile application SurveyCTO [37].
Measurements
The independent variable of interest was BIS, which was
measured during the baseline and follow-up surveys as
an index using items measuring programmatic input and
process indicators listed in Table 2 below. Three of the
BEmONC signal functions, namely administration of
parenteral uterotonics, administration of parenteral anti-
biotics, and administration of parenteral MgSO4 were
dropped from the calculation of the BIS score because
the availability of the drugs necessary for the provision
of these functions was already included under indicator
number 4 (Table 2).
As the variables are not on the same scale, they were
standardized by dividing the observed sum of the indi-
vidual variable scores values by their standard deviation
to make comparisons of variables and then aggregated

to obtain the BIS score. Thus, all the variables were
given equal weights. The BIS index was recalibrated to
range between zero and 10, with a higher score indicat-
ing better BIS. Cronbach’s alphas were calculated to as-
sess the internal reliability of the 12 items in measuring
the underlying construct of BIS. The possible values of
alpha range between zero and one, and values exceeding
.70 are regarded as acceptable [38, 39]. The Cronbach’s
alpha for the 12 items was .71.
The programmatic outcome variables of interest were the
facility delivery rate and the met need for BEmONC. The
facility delivery rate was defined as the proportion of deliv-
eries that took place in health facilities out of the total ex-
pected number of births in the catchment area. The
expected births were calculated based on information from
the catchment projected population—the population esti-
mate of a health center based on the regional population
growth rate estimate [40]—and the crude birth rate for the
catchment area. This was calculated as the number of deliv-
eries registered in health facilities in the last 12 months di-
vided by the expected number of live births in that period
and multiplied by 100. The facility delivery rate was calcu-
lated during the baseline and follow-up surveys. The met
need for BEmONC was defined as the proportion of
women with direct obstetric complications (including abor-
tion complications, postpartum hemorrhage, obstructed or
prolonged labor, and puerperal sepsis) treated at health cen-
ters in the last 12 months. It was calculated as the number
of women with obstetric complications treated at health
centers in the last 12 months divided by the estimated
number of women who would have obstetric complications
(i.e., 15% of expected births) [17] and multiplied by 100.
The met need was measured only during the follow-up sur-
vey, as the information about obstetric complications was
not collected during the baseline survey.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed for both descriptive and inferential
statistics using Stata version 14.2 [41]. Descriptive statis-
tics were used to analyze the inputs and process of ser-
vice delivery. A paired t-test was used to test the statistical
significance of the changes in the indicators of interest

between the baseline and follow-up surveys. An internal
comparison group analysis was also done to assess dose–
response relationships between BIS and the outcomes of
interest, such as whether health centers with higher im-
provements in BIS were associated with increased facility
delivery and the met need for BEmONC. Fixed-effects or-
dinary least-squares regression was used to assess the
dose–response relationship between the changes in BIS
found in the follow-up survey, compared with the baseline
survey, and the changes in the health center delivery rate
during the same period. Because information for the met
need was available only at one point in time, during the
follow-up survey, the cross-sectional dose–response rela-
tionship between BIS and met need was assessed using or-
dinary least-squares regression. A scatter plot was used to
visualize the associations.
Results
The findings are presented in four sections: 1) change in
BEmONC services over time, 2) changes in BIS and ser-
vice utilization over time, 3) relationship between changes
in BIS over time and changes in facility birth, and 4) rela-
tionship between changes in BIS over time and the met
need for BEmONC at the primary health care level.
Change in BEmONC services over time at the primary
health care level in Ethiopia
Facility input indicators, including the availability of
BEmONC-trained
providers,
availability
of
essential
drugs and equipment, laboratory tests, and facility infra-
structure, increased statistically significantly (p < .05)
over the study period (Table 3). The mean number of
BEmONC-trained providers increased significantly from
1.4 at baseline to 2.6 during the follow-up survey (p
< .05). Overall, the average number of laboratory tests
available showed significant improvement over the sur-
vey periods with urine analyses and VDRL syphilis tests
having
improved
significantly
over
time;
however,
hematological tests (hemoglobin and blood group) and
HIV tests for PMTCT did not show statistically signifi-
cant changes over time. Availability of individual drugs
in the health centers showed significant positive changes
for most drug categories except IV fluids and Nifedipine
(p < .05). The largest change was observed for MgSO4,
which
increased
by
65
percentage
points;
p < .01)
followed by Hydralazine (53 percentage points; p < .01),
and IV antibiotics (21 percentage points; p < .01). Like-
wise, the availability of medical equipment, including
vacuum extractor sets, radiant heaters, and oxygen con-
centrators, showed significant change. As the values for
the availability of IV fluids and sphygmomanometers
were already high in the baseline survey, it would be dif-
ficult to see much improvement during the follow-up
period; however, the availability of an ambulance service
and a focal person to coordinate referrals showed signifi-
cant improvements over the study period.
The average number of infection-prevention amenities
showed significant improvement over time (Table 4). The
hand-washing practice of providers (42 percentage points
increase, p < .01) and consistent use of personal protective
barriers by staff (26 percentage points increase, p < .01)
were among the larger changes seen. Illumination and ven-
tilation of the maternity units significantly decreased over
time (p < .05). This might be due to the difference in survey
periods, as the follow-up period was in the rainy season;
there might be frequent power failures as well as facilities
might blind ventilation outlets to warm maternity units.
Statistically, significant improvements were seen in health
center performance for removing retained products of con-
ception and assisted vaginal birth. However, there were no
statistically significant changes in the performance of man-
ual placenta removal and neonatal resuscitation.
Changes in the BIS and service utilization over time at the
primary health care level in Ethiopia
The BIS score ranged between zero and 10; which in-
creased (p < .05) from 4.3 (ranging from 0 to 8 at base-
line) to 6.7 (ranging from 2 to 10 at follow-up) (Table 5).
Correspondingly, the health center delivery rate in-
creased (p < .001) from 24% to 56%. The distribution of
health center delivery rates is presented in Fig. 2 below.
As shown in the box plot, 50% of health centers had a
delivery rate between 12.9 and 32.3 at baseline and be-
tween 37.2 and 71.8 at follow-up; while one (0.7%)
health center at baseline and 11 (8%) health centers at
follow-up had delivery rates above 100%, which might be
due to mothers from outside of their catchment area
coming to use the service at these health centers.
The met need for BEmONC was found to be 16% dur-
ing the follow-up survey. The most frequent obstetric
complication observed in this study was abortion compli-
cations, which accounted for about half (8.2%) of the com-
plications managed at health centers in the 12 months
prior to the survey. Postpartum hemorrhage (4.7%),
obstructed/prolonged labor (3.0%), and postpartum sepsis
(0.1%) account for the remaining half. The complications
managed considered for the met need at health centers
did not include hypertension/preeclampsia (though pro-
vide prereferral MgSO4 and antihypertensive drugs), ec-
topic pregnancy, and uterine rupture, which are managed
at hospitals with CEmONC services.
Relationship between changes in BIS over time and
changes in service utilization of facility birth provision at
the primary care level
Improvements in the BIS score over the study period were
significantly associated with improvements in health cen-
ter delivery: for every unit increase in BIS score across
Tiruneh et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth  (2018) 18:123 
Page 6 of 11
time, there was a 4.5 percentage points increase in facility-
based deliveries at health centers (Table 6 and Fig. 3).
However, some health centers’ BIS score declined over
time, mainly due to the decline in the availability of med-
ical equipment and infection-prevention amenities.
Relationship between changes in BIS score over time and
the met need for BEmONC at the primary care level
During the follow-up survey, facilities with a higher BIS
score were associated with a higher met need for
BEmONC (Table 7 and Fig. 4). On average, every unit
higher BIS score of a facility was associated with 3.1 per-
centage points higher met need for BEmONC.
Discussion
Our study is unique in reporting the effect of BIS on
programmatic outcomes at the primary level of care.
The variability in BIS across health facilities and time
has demonstrated a significant dose–response associ-
ation with the key program outcomes: for every unit
increase in BIS score, there was a corresponding average
increase of four to five facility-based delivery rates at the
primary health care level. Moreover, a higher BIS score
was associated with a higher met need for BEmONC.
This study showed that facility input and process indica-
tors increased significantly from the baseline survey, dem-
onstrating an increased level of readiness for emergencies
and management of common obstetric and newborn com-
plications in primary health care facilities. However, some
basic interventions like neonatal resuscitation and the
manual removal of the placenta did not change signifi-
cantly, which might be due to the lack of specific technical
skills. Accordingly, focused and more intense mentoring
and supportive supervision for particular skills, such as

interventions.
The mean number of skilled birth attendants (midwives,
nurses, and health officers) and pharmacy and laboratory
professionals working at health centers available at the
time of the survey were in line with the minimum require-
ments [42].
The implementation strength of BEmONC is strongly
associated with the improved availability and utilization of
obstetric services in the intervention facilities, which ul-
timately will enhance the uptake of life-saving interven-
tions to tackle the major causes of maternal and neonatal
mortality in Ethiopia. This indicates that investment in the
BEmONC initiative to upgrade primary level facilities is
effective. As such, policymakers and program planners
should make additional investments in improving the
availability of critical inputs for the provision of BEmONC
and closely monitor the process of service delivery at the
primary health care level, to improve the utilization of
maternal and newborn health services.
Conventionally, the availability of BEmONC signal
functions
at
health
facilities
is
used
to
monitor
BEmONC programs [17]. The BIS can supplement and
complement
this
by
providing
program
input
and
process indicators that are essential for program man-
agers to plan and monitor the provision of BEmONC
services. Moreover, the BIS index predicts the BEmONC
initiative outcomes well and has a good internal reliabil-
ity. Thus, this would help to measure effort over time
and gauge improvements of upgrading facilities for the
provision of basic life-saving interventions and the effect
of this effort on the utilization of maternal services out-
comes at the primary level of care.
It should be noted that the BIS index would serve to
monitor BEmONC implementation status of a health facility
at a glance; but is not suitable for making a programmatic
decision. If the BIS index score is at its maximum or near its

maximum value then it can be concluded that all the com-
ponents of the BEmONC interventions are being well im-
plemented. However, if the BIS index score is not at the
maximum or near the maximum value then individual items
of the BIS index should be monitored to identify the areas
with a gap.
There are several limitations with this study. First, the
study used a nonexperimental program evaluation design;
as such, the effect estimates could be confounded by un-
measured variables and the presence of possible selection
bias. Second, the BIS index is the aggregation of 12 items.
As a result, measurement error in one of the items would
potentially introduce measurement error to the composite
indicator. The observed association between BIS and the
outcome variables would likely be inconsistent if the
measurement error of the BIS is systematic.
Third, the change in data collection methods (paper-
based during the baseline and mHealth-based during the
follow-up) and different survey seasons between baseline
and follow-up could bias the observed changes in the
BIS index score and its components. However, these
would be unlikely to affect the observed associations be-
tween the dependent and independent variables. Fourth,
there is temporal ambiguity in the cross-sectional associ-
ation between the met need for BEmONC and BIS
index. Lastly, the BIS measure did not include all vital
program input indicators. For example, although all
health centers under study received post-training follow-
up visits, the BIS index did not include whether any add-
itional supervision and mentoring efforts were being
provided as well as other supportive supervision efforts
by hospitals and other partners, due to the problem of
data verification as part of the BIS, which may have had
a positive influence on the utilization of facility delivery
and the met need for BEmONC.
We recommend further research on the quality of intra-
partum care, the effect of BIS on the use of other maternal
and newborn health services, equitable use of BEmONC
services, and the cost of the BEmONC initiative. Provision
of quality BEmONC services is an essential component
for reducing maternal and newborn mortality rates [17].
As such, we recommend another study to investigate the
effect of BIS on the obstetric complications case fatality
rate, as well as on stillbirth and early neonatal death rates.
Moreover, examining the effect of BIS on the utilization of
other maternal and newborn health services is equally
important. Improved uptake of BEmONC does not guar-
antee all women are using these services fairly; disadvan-
taged women might not access and use life-saving
interventions. Disaggregated equity analysis of access to
life-saving services would help health policy makers devise
strategies to ensure equitable access to life-saving inter-
ventions for pregnant women who are beyond timely
access to BEmONC and for poor women. Accordingly, we
recommend other studies to examine the equitable use of
BEmONC services by mothers. Furthermore, analyzing

the cost of the BEmONC initiative is critical for policy-
makers and program planners, as an evidence base to
prioritize BEmONC and improve maternal and newborn
health at the primary health care level.
Finally, we used equal weights for the 12 items to con-
struct the BIS index, which might be questionable. Thus,
we would like to recommend further research to examine
whether and how to give differential weights to different
items measuring the BIS scores at the primary care level.
Conclusion
The BEmONC initiative was effective in improving insti-
tutional deliveries and may have also improved the met
need for BEmONC services. Potentially, the BIS index,
including its components, could be used to monitor the
implementation of BEmONC interventions.
