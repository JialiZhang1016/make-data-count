A long-standing question in biology is the effect of growth on
cell size. Here, we estimate the effect of Escherichia coli growth
rate (r) on population cell size distributions by estimating
the coefﬁcient of variation of cell lengths (CVL) from image
analysis of ﬁxed cells in DIC microscopy. We ﬁnd that the
CVL is constant at growth rates less than one division per
hour, whereas above this threshold, CVL increases with an
increase in the growth rate. We hypothesize that stochastic
inhibition of cell division owing to replication stalling by a
RecA-dependent mechanism, combined with the growth rate
threshold of multi-fork replication (according to Cooper and
Helmstetter), could form the basis of such a threshold effect. We
proceed to test our hypothesis by increasing the frequency of
stochastic stalling of replication forks with hydroxyurea (HU)
treatment and ﬁnd that cell length variability increases only
when the growth rate exceeds this threshold. The population
effect is also reproduced in single-cell studies using agar-pad
cultures and ‘mother machine’-based experiments to achieve
synchrony. To test the role of RecA, critical for the repair
of stalled replication forks, we examine the CVL of E. coli
recA cells. We ﬁnd cell length variability in the mutant to
be greater than wild-type, a phenotype that is rescued by
plasmid-based RecA expression. Additionally, we ﬁnd that
RecA-GFP protein recruitment to nucleoids is more frequent
at growth rates exceeding the growth rate threshold and is
further enhanced on HU treatment. Thus, we ﬁnd growth rates
greater than a threshold result in increased E. coli cell lengths
in the population, and this effect is, at least in part, mediated
by RecA recruitment to the nucleoid and stochastic inhibition
of division.

1. Introduction
The size and shape of a cell is considered a characteristic feature of a given cell type, and quantifying its
variability in a population provides information about the effect of ﬂuctuations on a complex phenotype.
Escherichia coli cells have typically been described as spherocylinders of length 2 µm and width 1 µm.
Differences in sizes are primarily owing to cell length (L) and not so much the width [1–3]. Cell
length frequency distributions show a positive skew owing to the presence of long cells (L > 8 μm),
the proportion of which is increased by environmental factors such as low bacterial density at 22°C
and 37°C or a shift to richer media [4]. In Salmonella, growth rate (r) alone has been shown to correlate
with increased cell size and multiple nucleoids [5], but a microscopic study on E. coli has shown that
cells grown at 22°C are shorter than at 37°C [4]. The effect of temperature and growth medium on
cell size appears thus to suggest that growth rate might primarily regulate the cell size. However, the
quantitative relationship and molecular mechanism by which growth could affect cell sizes remains
unclear.
The growth rate of bacteria, in particular, E. coli, is regulated by numerous pathways that typically
connect growth to nutrient availability [6–8]. Many genetic factors that link nutrient sensing to
cell size regulation have been identiﬁed [9–11]. These pathways, however, link growth rate via
pathways independent of replication to cell size. If DNA replication fails to complete and the bacterial
nucleoid does not segregate, the nucleoid ‘occlusion’ response results in cell elongation [12–14].
Based on the BCD—birth (B), chromosome replication (C) and division (D)—cycle [15], growth rates
exceeding one doubling per hour (doubling time, td = 60 min) result in insufﬁcient time for the
completion of the chromosome replication (C-period approx. 40 min) and cell division (D-period approx.
20 min). Cooper and Helmstetter postulated and experimentally demonstrated that E. coli undergoes
simultaneous rounds of replication, multi-fork replication [16] to overcome the shortening of td in
rapid growth. However, the role of multi-fork replication in cell size regulation has not yet been
investigated.
Recent improvements in light microscopy image analysis have allowed quantiﬁcation of bacterial
morphology and growth dynamics with subpixel accuracy [17–19]. Combined with ﬂuorescence
microscopy of subcellular components [20,21], it has become possible to address single-cell dynamics
of the bacterial cell division cycle. These advances now allow us to address the effect of population sizes
and physical factors and probe the mechanisms that control cell sizes and cell size variability.
Theoretical studies have suggested that asymmetric cell division [2], lognormal distribution of
growth rates [22] or stochastic partitioning of molecular components at cell division [23] could lead
to a heterogeneity in cell sizes in the population. Recent single-cell bacterial growth kinetic data [19]
combined with theoretical modelling have reopened the debate of whether cell-size robustness is
determined by a ‘timer’ or ‘sizer’ mechanism [24] and currently the ‘incremental’ or ‘adder’ model
appears to explain all available data [25,26]. However, the effect of molecular regulatory networks on
cell size and the correlation of cell size variability with growth rate remain unclear.
RecA is a central regulator of the SOS response pathway, and deletion mutants of E. coli for the
recA gene experience enhanced replication fork stalling [27]. Additionally, a recA1 mutation is known
to result in asynchronous replication and a reduction in the expected genome-copy numbers [15].
In previous work, we had found that a recA1 mutation phenocopies typical cell septation defects,
resulting in elongated cells containing multiple nucleoids and increased cell length variability [28]. While
replication fork stalling and repair are important for DNA replication, as reviewed by Cox et al. [29],
the artiﬁcial induction of replication stalling results in increased cell lengths [30]. The repair of stalled
replication forks by RecA protein assembly on DNA [31] also triggers SulA-mediated cell division
inhibition [32] via the SOS response pathway [33–35]. At the same time, the population growth rate
affects the number of replication forks per cell in a step-wise manner [16]. As a result, the number of
replication stalling events could be multiplicatively increased by growth rate and thus affect cell division.
Therefore, we hypothesize that RecA might provide the molecular link between E. coli growth rate and
cell length.
Here, we measure the correlation between cell length variability and growth rate from steady-state
cultures, and test our method against single-cell agar-pad and microﬂuidic growth assays. We ﬁnd
that cell size variability remains unchanged for slow-growing cultures, but increases above a threshold
growth rate. By increasing replication fork stalling with hydroxyurea (HU) in multiple mutant strains,
we demonstrate that DNA replication fork dynamics can affect population cell size distributions in a
RecA-dependent manner. From the growth-rate-dependent recruitment of RecA to the genome, we infer
a molecular mechanism that links growth rate to cell size.

2. Material and methods
2.1. Bacterial strains and plasmids
Multiple E. coli strains were used: MG1655 (6300, CGSC), ΔrecA (JW26691, CGSC), ΔsulA (JW09411,
CGSC), ΔslmA (JW56411, CGSC) and E. coli MG1655 with a GFP-tagged genomic copy of recA (recA-
GFP) was grown in the presence of 25 µg ml−1 kanamycin as described previously [36] (gift from Dr G.P.
Manjunath). Nucleoid segregation dynamics were followed in E. coli MG1655 with a pBAD24-hupA-gfp
plasmid with 100 µg ml−1 ampicillin [37] (gift from Dr Josette Rouviere-Yaniv). We constructed two recA
expression plasmids (i) mCherry tagged and (ii) arabinose-inducible, untagged. Two primer sets were
used with complementary regions to the genomic RecA sequence and overhangs for restriction digestion
for the p-recA-mCherry and pBAD-recA constructs (electronic supplementary material, table S1). The
recA gene was PCR-ampliﬁed (Mastercycler proS, Eppendorf, Germany) using Taq polymerase and
dNTPs (Bangalore GeNei, India) in recommended buffers. The template DNA, E. coli MG1655 genomic
DNA, was extracted by a rapid extraction method that avoids polysaccharide contamination [38]. The
recA amplicon for mCherry tagging and the p-mCherry plasmid were sequentially digested with SalI
and HindIII. The fragments were separated on an agarose gel, column-puriﬁed (QIAquick, Qiagen,
Germany) and ligated using a T4 DNA Ligase (Bangalore GeNei, India). The plasmid p-mCherry was
constructed by replacing the GFP sequence in a pGFP plasmid with mCherry from p-mCherry-N1 (both
plasmids from Clontech, USA) by directional cloning using the restriction enzymes SalI and EcoRI. The
recA amplicon for arabinose-inducible expression was puriﬁed, and both the amplicon and pBAD24
digested sequentially by NheI and XbaI, and ligated as before. Plasmids were transformed using the
CaCl2 method [39] in E. coli DH5α cells. Plasmids were isolated using a spin column-based method
(Miniprep Kit, Qiagen GmbH, Germany).
2.2. Growth media
For rapid growth, cells were grown in Luria–Bertani (LB) broth (HiMedia, Mumbai, India), while reduced
growth rate was achieved using the reduced media yeast extract broth (YEB): 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract in
1% (w/v) solutions of NaCl and tryptone broth (TB): 1% (w/v) tryptone in a 1% (w/v) solution of NaCl.
Additionally, M9 minimal salts medium [40] supplemented with 4 µg ml−1 thymidine were reconstituted
with three different carbon sources (to result in successively slower growth rates): 0.4% (w/v) glucose or
0.9% (w/v) succinic acid or 0.5% (w/v) sodium acetate (all sugars from Sigma-Aldrich). All broths and
media were made in deionized water and the pH was adjusted to 7.
2.3. Batch culture and growth rate estimation
Cells were grown at 37°C with shaking at 180 r.p.m. (Forma, ThermoScientiﬁc, USA) in 100 ml LB, YEB
and TB using a 1% overnight inoculum. Identical conditions were used to grow E. coli MG1655 in
M9 + sugars. Cell density was estimated by converting 1 OD600 nm = 8 × 108 cells ml−1 [41]. To estimate
the growth rate (r), the averaged OD with time curves were ﬁt to the solution to the logistic equation by
N(t) =
N(0) · K
N(0) + (K −N(0)) · e−r·t ,
(2.1)
where N(0) is the population at the time of inoculation, r is the growth rate (h−1), K is the carrying
capacity and t is time (electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S1). Doubling time is td = 1/r [42].
2.4. Continuous cell culture
A PDMS-based microﬂuidic device was used to grow E. coli MG1655 culture continuously based on
the ‘mother machine’ design [19]. The device was designed as a two-layered micro-pattern mask in
CleWin (WieWin Web, The Netherlands) and fabricated by using an approximately 100 nm layer of
gold (for aligning the second layer) followed by spin-coating a 2 µm layer SU8-2 negative photoresist
(Microchem, USA) onto a SiO2 wafer using a spin coater model WS-400B-6NPP LITE (Laurell Tech.
Corp., USA). The photoresist was cured by UV exposure with a mask (EVG, Austria) corresponding
to the trench and dead-end channels. Unexposed photoresist was washed and a 20 µm layer of SU8-20
negative photoresist (Microchem, USA) spun and exposed to UV corresponding only to the trench, for

curing. The PDMS device was made by mixing elastomer : curing agent of 10 : 1 w/w (Sylgard 184, Dow-
Corning, USA) and coating the wafer and heat-curing it in an oven at 60°C (Raut Scientiﬁc, Maharashtra,
India) for 2 h. The cured PDMS membrane was cleaned with pentane (Sigma-Aldrich, Mumbai, India)
and washed with acetone (Fisher Scientiﬁc, Mumbai, India). The air-dried device was then bonded
in air using a plasma cleaner (Emitech K050X, Quorum Technologies, UK) under RF power of 70 W,
washing time of 30 s and 1 mbar vacuum (Edwards Pumps, UK). The PDMS-glass device was integrated
and channels passivated by passing 10 mg ml−1 of BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, Mumbai, India) for 1 h. E. coli
MG1655 cells were infused into the device (OD ∼1.0) and allowed to diffuse into the channels for 1 h at
37°C using a syringe pump (PHD Ultra, Harvard Apparatus, USA). The device was washed by ﬂowing
in either fresh LB medium or M9 + succinate at a constant ﬂow rate of 0.3 ml h−1. Cell growth and
division were observed in DIC microscopy. To measure the effect of HU treatment in continuous culture,
E. coli MG1655 and recA strains expressing eGFP from a plasmid were introduced in the microﬂuidics
device as before. Cells were grown under continuous ﬂow in LB for 1 h (approx. three generations),
followed by a change of the medium to the corresponding medium supplemented with 30 mM HU for
1 h (‘treatment’). Subsequently, the medium without any drug (no HU) was once again replaced for 2.5 h
of ‘recovery’. Fluorescence time-lapse images were acquired in the GFP channel and analysed.
2.5. Hydroxyurea and trimethoprim treatment
Overnight cultures were grown from a single colony of E. coli MG1655, recA, sulA, slmA and
recA + pRecA-mCherry. The cultures were diluted 1 : 100 (1% inoculum) into 5 ml of fresh LB and
M9 + 0.9% succinate and grown at 37°C with shaking (180 r.p.m.). E. coli MG1655 with genomic RecA-
GFP was similarly grown in LB, TB and YEB at 37°C with shaking. At OD600 nm ∼0.2, the cultures were
incubated in 10–100 mM HU containing growth medium for three generations corresponding to 1 h in LB,
1.5 h in TB, 2 h in YEB, 3 h in M9 + succinate. Subsequently, cells were allowed to recover for another three
generations. Similarly, E. coli MG1655 cells grown in LB and M9 + succinate were exposed to 1 µg ml−1
trimethoprim (Sigma-Aldrich, India) and allowed to recover for 1 and 3 h, respectively. After recovery,
all cultures (treated and untreated) were washed, ﬁxed and imaged.
2.6. Western blotting
Escherichia coli MG1655 and recA cells grown in LB, YEB and TB media were grown for three generations
and treated with HU as above. The OD at 600 nm was measured before treatment and after recovery,
and 1 ml cell suspensions were diluted to result in comparable cell densities (electronic supplementary
material, table S2). The cells were pelleted, washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), resuspended
in 50 µl of lysis buffer consisting of 10 µl of 5× SDS loading dye (250 mM Tris–Cl (pH 6.8), 10% SDS,
50% glycerol, 0.5% bromophenol blue and 500 mM DTT) and 40 µl PBS, heated to 95°C for 10 min
with constant shaking at 700 r.p.m. (ThermoMixer, Eppendorf, Germany), and samples were centrifuged
before loading on a 10% SDS–PAGE gel run at 120 V (Bio-Rad, USA). Proteins were transferred onto
a PVDF membrane (Immobilon-P transfer membrane, EMD Millipore Corporation, USA) and the
membrane blocked with 5% milk powder in TBST buffer (Tris–Cl-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and 0.1%
Tween 20). Rabbit antiserum raised against E. coli RecA [43] (a gift from Dr K. Muniyappa) was diluted
to 1 : 12 000 in blocking agent (5% milk powder in TBST buffer) and incubated with 100 ml of cell lysate
of E. coli recA for 12 h at 4°C to immunodeplete non-speciﬁc antibodies. The lysate was prepared
by growing E. coli recA cells to OD600 nm approximately 2.0, resuspending the pellet in PBST (PBS
with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20) and lysis by pulse sonication for 2 min, 30 cycles. The membrane was
incubated with this pre-treated serum at 4°C overnight, washed and hybridized with the secondary
HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody, 1 : 10 000 diluted (Jackson ImmunoResearch, USA). The blot was
developed using a reagent Luminata Femto (Millipore Corporation, USA) and luminescence images
acquired (LAS 4000, GE Healthcare, USA).
2.7. Cell immunostaining
Escherichia coli MG1655 were grown to the mid-log phase and cells ﬁxed with 1.6% paraformaldehyde
(PFA) and 0.01% glutaraldehyde, incubated for 1 h and washed three times with PBST. The cells were
treated with GTE (50 mM glucose, 25 mM Tris–Cl, 10 mM EDTA) containing 5 µg ml−1 lysozyme and
incubated at 37°C for 45 min, followed by 3× wash with PBST. The cell suspension was spread on poly-L-
lysine-coated coverslips and air-dried for 1 h. Coverslips were washed three times with PBST, incubated

with 2% BSA (blocking agent) for 1 h, washed with PBST and incubated with the rabbit anti-RecA serum
(1 : 1000 diluted in PBS) at 4°C for approximately 12 h. The coverslip was then incubated at 37°C for 1 h
with Alexa647 conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, USA) and mounted on slides.
2.8. Fluorimetry
E. coli recA-GFP was grown in 5 ml of LB, TB and YEB (1% inoculum) with 25 µg ml−1 kanamycin at
37°C with constant shaking. The cultures were treated with 30 mM HU as above. Cell suspensions
(1 ml) were sampled at pre-treatment (pt) and recovery (r) stages, and r-samples were diluted in the
respective growth medium based on the ratio of OD recovery : pre-treatment samples (LB: pt 0.23, r 1.3;
YEB: pt 0.195, r 0.92; TB: pt 0.193, r 0.819). All samples were pelleted and resuspended in 50 µl PBS and
ﬂuorescence measured in a 96-well half-area round bottom black plate (Corning, USA) using 480 nm
excitation and 510 nm emission in a Varioskan Flash multifunctional plate reader (Thermo Scientiﬁc,
USA). Measurements were blank-subtracted by measuring E. coli MG1655 of the same density grown in
LB, YEB and TB. Fluorescence per cell was estimated by dividing by the total cell numbers in 50 µl by
using the conversion 1 OD600 nm = 8 × 108 cells ml−1 as before.
2.9. Microscopy
Cells were sampled (200 µl) from the batch cultures at the mid-log phase and ﬁxed in 4% PFA, stained
with 0.1 µg µl−1 of DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich, India) and mounted, as has been described previously [28].
Fixed cells of E.coli MG1655 recA-GFP and E. coli recA expressing RecA-Cherry were acquired using
the 100× (Plan Apochromat N.A. 1.4, oil) objective of a Zeiss Axio Imager Z1 (Carl Zeiss, Germany)
microscope in ﬂuorescence and DIC channels. For live-imaging, cells were grown on 2% agar pads
with 100 µg ml−1 ampicillin and induced for 2 h by 0.2% Arabinose (Sisco Research Labs, Mumbai,
India) to express HupA-GFP and imaged on a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany)
simultaneously in ﬂuorescence (Diode laser 405 nm, beam splitter MBS 405, pinhole 126.5 corresponding
to 1 airy unit) and DIC modes using a 63× lens (Plan Apochromat NA 1.40, oil). Multiple positions
were scanned as 512 × 512 pixel images (0.264 µm per pixel) with an image acquired every 2 min
for approximately 2 h and at 37°C.
2.10. Image analysis
Cell lengths were automatically analysed from DIC images of ﬁxed cells using a previously developed
algorithm [28] in Matlab R2014b (MathWorks Inc., MA, USA). The source code has been released on a
GPL basis and can be downloaded from a Github repository (https://github.com/athale/ecolilenDIC).
The birth lengths and the division lengths of E. coli cells in the ‘mother machine’ and RecA puncta were
interactively estimated using IMAGEJ (v. 1.50f) [44]. Kymographs of E. coli cells expressing plasmid-
based eGFP grown in the ‘mother machine’ were generated by using ‘multiplekymograph’ plugin in
IMAGEJ [44] based on a line of interest drawn along the growth channel. RecA puncta were quantiﬁed by
selecting a segmented line corresponding to the length of the E. coli cell in DIC and used to generate an
intensity proﬁle in the RecA-GFP and DAPI channels. Co-localized peaks were used to score cells in the
population and calculate the percentage cells showing such co-localization of RecA on the nucleoid.
To follow the dynamics of nucleoid segregation, intensity proﬁles from timeseries of pHupA-GFP-
transformed cells were plotted as a matrix to produce a kymograph (space–time plot), using the imagesc
function in Matlab R2014b (MathWorks Inc.). Western blot intensity analysis was performed using ‘gel
analyser’, an IMAGEJ plugin. The protein band area was obtained by using the ‘label peaks’ function
and maximum normalized for comparison.
2.11. Data analysis
Cell frequency distributions were normalized by the sum of the area under the curve, ﬁt to a lognormal
distribution to obtain lognormal mean (µ) and variance (v) using ﬁtdist, lognpdf and lognstat functions
using Matlab with the Statistics Toolbox (MathWorks Inc.). The Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test statistic

was calculated for the number of bins (n = 44) and signiﬁcance level (α) of 0.01 to arrive at a test statistic
(D (α,n)) given by [45,46]
D(α,n) =

−ln(α/2)
2n
.
(2.2)
The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of observed and ﬁt data was calculated for each bin
(i) from the length–frequency distribution. The difference |di| = |Fi −ˆFi| between the observed (Fi) and
expected (ˆFi) values of the CDF was evaluated, and the maximum (dmax) was found. The hypothesis that
the ﬁt to the data was good was accepted if dmax < D(α,n). Variability in cell lengths was quantiﬁed by
the coefﬁcient of variation (CVL) using the expression CVL = σ L/μL, where σ L and μL are the standard
deviation and mean of cell lengths, respectively.
3. Results
3.1. Growth rate affects population cell length distributions of Escherichiacoli MG1655
With the aim of measuring the effect of growth rate, r, on cell size, E. coli MG1655 cells were grown in LB,
YEB, TB and M9 supplemented with glucose, succinate and acetate. As expected, the growth of cells was
the fastest in LB and decreased for all other media with the slowest growth observed in M9 supplemented
with acetate (ﬁgure 1a). Doubling time (td) values were obtained from logistic function (equation (2.1)) ﬁt
to the growth curves (electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S1) and ranged between 33 and 273 min
(table 1). Cells sampled from the mid-log phase of each culture (ﬁgure 1a) were imaged, analysed and
the frequency distributions of cell lengths ﬁt to a lognormal function (ﬁgure 1b). The goodness of the
ﬁt was validated based on the KS non-parametric test (electronic supplementary material, table S3).
The number of cells analysed in each sample ranged between 102 and 103 cells, comparable to previous
microscopic studies on population cell size distributions [2,47]. Corresponding to the decrease in growth
rate, the cell length distributions also decreased in spread. The spread of the distribution was maximal
in samples grown in LB and minimal in M9 + acetate, with intermediate growth rates (in YEB, TB,
M9 + glucose, M9 + succinate), resulting in an intermediate spread of cell lengths. The growth rate thus
appears to alter the quantitative nature of the cell length distribution, while leaving the qualitative nature
(lognormal) unchanged. Dynamic imaging of a population of E. coli MG1655 cells expressing HupA-GFP
to label the DNA demonstrated that most cells divided normally, whereas elongated cells arose rarely
and were accompanied by hampered DNA segregation (electronic supplementary material, video S1).
This hints at cell division failure and DNA replication–segregation coupling as a potential cause for the
observed variability of cell lengths. However, because the population distributions analysed from ﬁxed
cell microscopy are taken from unsynchronized bulk cultures, we proceeded to examine if the cell-cycle
stage does indeed affect our analysis, using live cells in continuous culture.
3.2. Single-cell analysis of lengths of newborn and dividing cells in microfluidics
The ‘mother machine’ microﬂuidics device described previously by Wang et al. [19] is ideally suited
for single-cell analysis of rod-shaped cell growth dynamics. We capture birth and division events and
estimate cell lengths (ﬁgure 2a) from timeseries of cells grown in LB (electronic supplementary material,
video S2) and M9 + succinate (electronic supplementary material, video S3) at 37°C. The frequency
distribution of the cell lengths from single-cell analysis also ﬁt a lognormal distribution (ﬁgure 2b–e),
similar to the ﬁxed-cell data, with the goodness of ﬁt validated by the KS Test (electronic supplementary
material, table S3). While the variance of cell lengths in LB showed a difference between newborn
cells (ﬁgure 2b) and cells just prior to division (ﬁgure 2c), the mean cell length of newborn cells was
also smaller (μ = 2.7 µm, v = 0.9 µm2) than dividing cells (μ = 5.28 µm, v = 3.29 µm2). As a result, the
normalized variability measured by the coefﬁcient of variation of cell lengths (CVL) remained constant
for cells grown in LB—0.3188 for newborn cells (arithmetic mean 2.73 µm, s.d. 0.87 µm) and 0.3129
for dividing cells (arithmetic mean 5.27 µm, s.d. 1.65 µm). This suggests that population cell length
variability is independent of cell growth stage, based on the two extreme cases, i.e. newborn and dividing
cells in the same growth medium. Compared with LB, cell length distributions of cultures grown in
M9 + succinate have a narrower spread in data from both newborn (ﬁgure 2d) and dividing (ﬁgure 2e)
cells. The CVL of these cells is 0.156 (newborn) and 0.139 (dividing), twofold smaller than those measured
in LB, conﬁrming the qualitative impression. This suggests that the cell length variability as measured
by CVL from single-cell experiments is independent of the cell-cycle stage in a given medium, while

for 140 min (ﬁgure 3a; electronic supplementary material, video S4). Consistent with previous reports
of growth rate heterogeneity in single cells [48], we ﬁnd that growth rates vary in the range of 0.6–
2.3 h−1 in the population (ﬁgure 3b). Each colony examined originates from a single cell, and hence at
the end of 140 min when microcolony sizes vary, the cell–cell variation in growth rates is conﬁrmed.
The population cell length distribution of these microcolonies also ﬁt a lognormal function (ﬁgure 3c),
with the goodness of ﬁt evaluated using the KS test (electronic supplementary material, table S3). To
our surprise, the CVL from individual microcolonies appeared to increase with increasing growth rate
(ﬁgure 3d). Because the sample size in each CVL measurement of a single microcolony is very small, and
the growth-rate difference between single cells is difﬁcult to control and is possibly the result of intrinsic
stochastic variability, we instead proceeded to modulate average growth rate by the nutrient medium
and analyse cell size variability in ﬁxed cell microscopy, to take advantage of better population statistics.
3.4. Cell length variability affected by a combination of growth rate, recA and hydroxyurea
Cell length variability was quantiﬁed in the mid-log phase of cells grown in media resulting in growth
rates ranging between 0.2 and 1.81 h−1 by using LB, the reduced media YEB, TB and M9 supplemented
with sugars, to modulate growth rates (table 1). We ﬁnd that cells grown in M9 supplemented with
glucose, succinate and acetate are less variable (CVL < 0.25), and the variability increases gradually
with increasing growth rate (ﬁgure 4a). When the growth rate (r) exceeds 1 division per hour (in TB,
YEB and LB), the CVL appears to enter a second phase of a steeper increase. This inﬂection point also
correlates with the growth rate threshold for multi-fork (mf) replication (rmf = 1 h−1) [16]. Because multi-
fork replication changes the genomic content per cell (G), we used a previously developed expression
relating G with the BCD cycle [49] and doubling times, to estimate it as
G = td · (2(C+D)/td −2D/td)
C · ln 2

Figure 4. Effect of growth rate and replication stochasticity on cell lengths. (a) The cell length variability from the mid-log phase
of cultures (y-axis) is plotted as a function of the growth rate (x-axis). The growth rate of rmf = 1 h−1 (red line) is the multi-fork
replication threshold based on Cooper & Helmstetter [16]. Error bars indicate s.d. (b) The measured cell length variability (y-axis) is
plotted as a function of the expected total cellular DNA (x-axis) based on the model of Zaritsky etal. [49] (equation (3.1)). (c) Cell length
variability of E. coli (y-axis) with increasing hydroxyurea (HU) concentration (x-axis) was estimated for the following strains: MG1655
(dots), recA (asterisks), slmA (circles), sulA (x) and recA + pRecA-mCherry (open squares). Cultures were grown either in LB

where td is the doubling time, C is the period of chromosome (DNA) replication and D is the time for
cell division (septum formation). We combine the experimentally measured doubling times for different
growth media (table 1) with an assumed C-period of 40 min and D-period of 20 min [16,50]. We ﬁnd that
the measured CVL is positively correlated to increasing values of the estimated average genome content
(G) per cell (ﬁgure 4b). This correlation demonstrates that genome content and cell size regulation could
be coupled.
Because the genome content dependence of CVL does not, however, reproduce a biphasic, threshold
dependence in cell length variability (ﬁgure 4a), we examined whether perturbing replication dynamics
below and above the presumptive growth rate threshold could be used as a test of replication
stochasticity as the underlying mechanism. HU is known to induce stochastic replication fork
stalling [51,52] and the RecA protein is critical for restarting stalled replication forks [31]. Expectedly,
cells mutant for recA have a reduced ability to recover stalled replication forks [35]. To our surprise, on
treatment with HU, both wild-type and recA cells showed an increase in CVL when grown in LB, but
not when grown in M9 + succinate (ﬁgure 4c and electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S5). Thus,
slow growth appears to protect cells from the cell-division defects of HU, but rapid growth induces an
increase followed by saturation in cell length variability. E. coli recA mutants, however, differ from wild-
type, because the difference of CVL between LB and M9 + succinate was more pronounced. On the other
hand, minimal medium-grown cells lacking sulA, ‘the effector’ of RecA, are less variable when compared
with wild-type and do not respond to HU treatment. The treatment of LB and minimal medium-grown
slmA and recA cells expressing RecA-mCherry cells results in variability comparable to MG1655. The
‘rescue’ of the wild-type phenotype by expression of RecA in a mutant background and the variability of
sulA mutant suggest the speciﬁcity of the RecA-SulA mechanism for growth-rate-dependent regulation
of cell size. Additionally, the increase and saturation of cell size variability on treatment with HU of wild-
type cells only during rapid but not slow growth further validate the threshold growth rate dependence
of cell length variability. The growth-rate-dependent increase in cell length variability with trimethoprim
treatment (ﬁgure 4d), a drug known to increase replication fork stalling [53], reinforces replication
stochasticity as a mechanism regulating cell size. Based on this, we hypothesize that, in addition to

and (e,g) E. coli recA mutants were both grown at 37°C in the ‘mother machine’ with three phases in the nutrient supplied I: LB (‘pre-

its previously known roles, RecA recruitment to replication fork stalls [54] could mechanistically relate
growth rate with cell size variability.
3.5. Single-cell dynamics of Escherichiacoli MG1655 and recA with hydroxyurea treatment
Based on this evidence from ﬁxed cells, we expect that HU treatment should affect single-cell dynamics
in a manner similar to the effect at a population level. To test this, E. coli MG1655 cells expressing
eGFP from a plasmid were grown in the ‘mother machine’ in LB with the medium changed in three
stages: 1 h pre-treatment (stage I), 1 h 30 mM HU treatment (stage II) and 2.5 h recovery from HU (stage
III). Most cells continued to divide normally (ﬁgure 5a) and a few appeared to undergo moderate
ﬁlamentation (cell lengths approx. 7 µm) at the end of the ‘recovery’ period (ﬁgure 5c). The kymographs
suggest that the division of some cells is unaffected (ﬁgure 5b), while a few undergo ﬁlamentation
(ﬁgure 5d). Most E. coli recA cells continued to divide normally after recovery from treatment (ﬁgure 5e),
whereas others became prominently ﬁlamentous, resulting in cell lengths of approx. 12 µm (ﬁgure 5g).
The kymographs conﬁrmed regular divisions of most cells (ﬁgure 5f), while a failure of division in
some resulted in cell ﬁlamentation (ﬁgure 5h). This qualitatively corroborates our observations from
population measurements that (i) cell division failure results in elongated cells, (ii) cell ﬁlamentation
is probabilistic and (iii) the extent of cell ﬁlamentation is greater in recA cells owing to a more
extreme ﬁlamentation phenotype, when compared with E. coli MG1655. From population and single-
cell dynamics, we hypothesize that cells that rapidly divide and are treated with HU are expected to
have a higher frequency of ﬁlamentation and greater variability owing to increased RecA recruitment to
the DNA. We proceed to test this hypothesis using microscopy.
3.6. Nucleoid localization of recA corresponds to increased cell length variability
To test the hypothesis of growth rate-dependent recruitment of RecA to the genome, an E. coli MG1655
strain expressing an endogenous RecA-GFP protein [36] was grown in three different media: LB, YEB
and TB, to modulate growth rates as before. RecA foci co-localization with the nucleoid (labelled
with DAPI) appeared to increase when cells were grown in LB when compared with YEB and TB
(ﬁgure 6a). Treatment with HU resulted in increased co-localization when compared with untreated
cells grown in the same growth medium (ﬁgure 6a). The proportion of cells with co-co-localization of
the RecA protein on the nucleoid is low (less than 15% cells with RecA-DNA co-localization) during
slow growth (TB), intermediate (approx. 15%) for cells in YEB and high (approx. 30%) in LB during

rapid growth (ﬁgure 6b). The co-localization percentages are further increased on HU treatment. This
is evidenced by the percentage cells with co-localized RecA-GFP and DNA increasing linearly with
growth rate for untreated cells, with a 1.4-fold increase in the slope for HU-treated cells (ﬁgure 6b).
The percentage co-localization of treated and untreated cells correlates positively with CVL, consistent
with our previous results of increasing cell length variability with growth rate and HU treatment. As
before, the variability of HU-treated cells is higher for the same growth medium, when compared
with untreated cells. To test if the co-localization of RecA with the nucleoid was not the result of
an artefact of GFP tagging of RecA, the native RecA protein was immunostained in ﬁxed cells of
E. coli MG1655 and analysed for co-localization with DNA by DAPI staining in multiple ﬁelds of view

(electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S6a). The percentage cells with RecA co-localized on the
nucleoid matched the values from the RecA-GFP co-localization (electronic supplementary material,
ﬁgure S6b). In addition, the measured cell length variability from the DIC images was also comparable
between the RecA-GFP-expressing strain and the immunostained samples (electronic supplementary
material, ﬁgure S6c). Alternatively, we also imaged the localization of RecA-mCherry protein expressed
from a plasmid in E. coli recA cells grown in LB (electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S7a)
and found the RecA-nucleoid co-localization to be comparable to anti-RecA and RecA-GFP-based
quantiﬁcation (electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S7b). The CVL of all three samples remained
comparable (electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S7c), suggesting that RecA protein tagging did
not result in artefacts in either localization or cell length variability. To test if the increased co-localization
could have resulted from RecA protein abundance instead of recruitment, we measured the RecA-
GFP concentration per cell in ﬂuorimetry and found that HU-treated cells had a slightly increased
(approx. 1.25-fold) RecA-GFP expression per cell, for all three growth media tested (ﬁgure 6c). Western

also appear to show increased protein in cell lysates on HU treatment, independent of the growth
medium (electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S8a). Quantiﬁcation showed an approximately 1.5-
to threefold increase in RecA (electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S8b) and RecA-GFP intensity
after HU treatment, in all growth media tested, not owing to loading artefacts (electronic supplementary
material, ﬁgure S8c,d). Additionally, the expression of RecA-GFP from the genomic locus also increased
by 2.5-fold on HU treatment (electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S8e,f), with non-speciﬁc protein
content remaining comparable (electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S8g,h). Taken together, the
results suggest that RecA recruitment to the nucleoid could serve as one of multiple mechanisms that
drive growth rate-dependent cell size variability in clonal populations, independent of RecA protein
abundance.
4. Discussion
While the study of average values of cell size [55,56] and single-cell studies [19,26,48] have demonstrated
that cell size is robust to environmental changes, understanding the population distribution remains
important to the ecology of microbes and their survival in changing environments [57,58].
Here, we have examined the population variability of clonal cell sizes and their link to growth rate.
We demonstrate that at a ﬁxed growth rate, the cell length variability is constant and independent of
the cell-cycle stage using a microﬂuidics-based continuous culture system. Additionally, the growth
rate of microcolonies on an agar pad appears to correlate with cell-cycle synchronized variability in cell
lengths. However, in our analysis, quantitative ﬁxed cell microscopy from bulk cultures results in better
statistics and a more robust control over growth rates. We ﬁnd increasing growth rates increases the
population variability in cell lengths in a bi-phasic manner, with the two phases separated by a growth
rate threshold, rmf (the growth rate of multi-fork replication). HU treatment, known to induce DNA
replication fork stalling, increases the cell length variability of only those cells which are undergoing
rapid growth. This HU-induced variability is further enhanced in a recA mutant when compared with
wild-type. The linear increase in RecA co-localization on the nucleoid with growth rate and cell length
variability suggests the involvement of the RecA protein in coupling increasing growth rates to higher
cell length variability.
In general, stochastic partitioning of subcellular components has been shown to be a major source
of cell phenotypic variability in a study combining theory and experiment [23]. Our observations on
the role of stochastic replication dynamics potentially add to the potential contributors to phenotypic
variability or ‘noise’. We expect stochastic DNA replication–segregation effects on cell size, should result
in cell elongation owing to incomplete segregation of DNA. In agar-pad growth experiments in DIC
and ﬂuorescence of E. coli MG1655 with nucleoids labelled by HupA-GFP, most cells divide to produce
newborn cells with typical birth lengths of approximately 2 µm after successfully segregating their
nucleoids in approximately 20 min (electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S4a and video S1). On the
other hand, rare cells become approximately 40 µm long, after their nucleoids fail to segregate even after
50 min (electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S4b and video S1). Growing wild-type and mutant
strains in multiple growth media with HU and trimethoprim, we show that cell length variability is
greater when replication processivity is perturbed, depending on the growth rate.
Cell size is a complex phenotype and is inﬂuenced by multiple pathways such as nutrient sensing
[9–11,59], the division site selection by the minCDE proteins [60,61], nucleoid occlusion to sense

incomplete replication [51,62] and the SOS response pathway [34,35]. However, this is the ﬁrst study,
to the best of our knowledge, that proposes a mechanism connecting growth rate with cell length
variability based on multi-fork replication. It remains to be seen if a more direct method of replication
fork tracking [30] can be used to test this proposed mechanism.
In previous studies on mammalian cell size regulation, the statistics of ﬁxed cells were used to estimate
the ‘variability’ [63]. While many older studies on bacterial cell length regulation [2,64] made use of such
an approach, the advent of single-cell approaches have improved the robustness and accuracy of E. coli
cell size and division measurements [18,19]. However, in the process, the population effects have been
ignored. In this work, we attempt to bridge this gap. Additionally, we test our method of population
variability measurement for artefacts that could result from a lack of cell cycle stage synchronization of
the population. Indeed by measuring the growth of populations under different growth conditions, we
ﬁnd that the growth rate dependence of cell size variability is related to genome copy numbers per cell
and is independent of synchronization.
We ﬁnd the genome-copy number per cell, driven by growth rate, appears to positively correlate with
cell size distributions in the population. An analogous study in yeast has examined the effect of the
ploidy of speciﬁc genes on cell size regulation [65]. In the case of this study, while the genome copies per
cell increase cell size variability, we have not estimated the possible role of speciﬁc genes and their ploidy
on cell sizes. Additionally, our microcolony analysis once more reveals growth rate differences between
clonal individuals under identical conditions (ﬁgure 3d). While these differences are not addressed in our
study, it would be useful to extend our current analysis to the possible role of speciﬁc genes and proteins
in single-cell growth rate variability.
The RecA protein, examined in this study for a relationship with growth-rate-dependent cell size
variability, is an SOS response pathway protein. It has previously been shown to enhance the recovery
of stalled replication forks [29,66]. At the same time, when RecA is recruited to DNA, it activates SulA,
which sequesters FtsZ monomers [34], thus acting as a cell division inhibitor. Fast-growing E. coli are
also known to initiate multiple replication forks [16,67]. DNA replication fork progression is known to
be stochastic [68]. The increase in cell length variability that we observe as a function of growth rate
in wild-type E. coli can thus be explained by a model where RecA recruitment to stalled replication
forks (ﬁgure 7a) leads to an increase in the proportion of elongated cells owing to cell-division inhibition
(ﬁgure 7b). The cause for the onset of this process during rapid growth, we hypothesize, results from
the probabilistic replication fork stalling (ﬁgure 7a) and the multiplicative effect owing to multi-fork
replication [16]. While a computer simulation of multi-fork replication in the E. coli cell cycle exists [49],
an explicit model of replication stochasticity coupled to multi-fork replication dynamics could help
further test our hypothesis.
Our observations of the role of RecA in cell size variability have two parts: (i) the effect of a functional
copy of recA and (ii) the effect of a recA deletion. (i) We observed population cell length variability
of E. coli to increase with growth rate (ﬁgures 1–3) and tested the hypothesis that increasing RecA
localization on the genome with increasing growth rate correlated with this growth rate dependence
(ﬁgure 6). We ﬁnd that RecA-SulA-mediated cell division inhibition increases cell length variability in
rapid growth in wild-type cells (ﬁgure 4). Additionally, in rapidly growing cultures of the wild-type
(LB, 37°C), overexpression of the RecA protein from the pRecA-mCherry (electronic supplementary

material, ﬁgure S9a) and arabinose-inducible pBAD24-RecA constructs (electronic supplementary
material, ﬁgure S9b) did not affect cell length variability (electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S2a,b).
In cells missing a copy of recA, treatment with 30 mM HU increased the variability of cell lengths
(electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S3a). The overexpression of plasmid-based copy of recA
in these cells from pRecA-mCherry and pBAD24-recA plasmids reduced the spread of cell lengths
to levels comparable to untreated MG1655 (electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S3b). (ii) As
reported previously, in the absence of RecA, the function of DNA replication fork stall rescue is
hindered [31], resulting in replication defects [66] which are not repaired owing to the inability of
the cell to induce an SOS response through LexA cleavage [69]. This results in cell division inhibition
potentially owing to nucleoid occlusion [70,71] and additional RecA-independent pathways that detect
incomplete replication [51]. However, distinct from previous work, we ﬁnd greater variability in cell
lengths in a recA strain when compared with hydroxyurea-treated wild-type cells in LB (ﬁgure 4c). We
also demonstrate that the phenotype can be rescued by plasmid-based expression of the RecA protein,
both with and without a ﬂuorescent tag (ﬁgure 4c and electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S2a,b).
In future, our data could form the basis of a mathematical model, extending a previously developed
model of recA gene expression dynamics during UV-based damage [72], focusing instead on the effect of
growth rates.
HU treatment increases replication fork stalling and slows down DNA replication [73] and also
results in cell division failure. Stalled replication forks that are not repaired, result in incomplete
DNA replication [29] and result in elongated cells owing to cell division inhibition [12,13]. A direct
measurement of replication fork dynamics of a population of dividing bacteria based on methods used to
study the single molecule replication dynamics [30,74] could be used to potentially test our predictions
at a subcellular level. Additionally, recently developed artiﬁcial ‘replication roadblocks’ in E. coli [30] and
Bacillus subtilis [62] could be used in future to generate known number of replication fork stalling events
and quantify their effect on population cell lengths, as a further test of the model.
The role of small proportions of outliers or ‘tails’ in phenotypic variability of a population has been
shown to confer advantages to ‘persister’ cells, when the population undergoes selection [57,58,75].
However, a clear functional role for cell lengths is yet to be unambiguously determined. Suggestive
evidence from clinical isolates of uropathogenic E. coli have implied that ﬁlamentous cells are harder for
immune cells to clear than those of normal length [76]. In future, a study of the possible role of cell size
and shape of not just E. coli in their natural environment could shed more light on the possible role in
cell survival.
Our results suggest that an increased genome copy numbers in E. coli increases cell size heterogeneity.
This is consistent with single-cell measurements in E. coli [30], but in contrast with S. cerevisiae, which
shows that increased genome copy numbers lead to reduced ‘noise’ in cell size distributions [65]. To
infer general principles from these results, the distribution of DNA replication origins in yeast and the
concurrent nature of replication in bacteria will need to be taken into account. It can be presumed that the
effect we report will only occur in organisms where rapid growth entails multiple simultaneous rounds
of DNA replication.
5. Conclusion
In conclusion, we ﬁnd that cell length variability of wild-type E. coli increases with increasing
growth rate in a non-monotonic manner above a growth rate threshold for multi-fork replication
(rmf). This variability is independent of cell-cycle stage synchronization of the population. Increasing
HU concentrations to modulate replication stochasticity only changes the cell length distributions of
populations undergoing rapid growth, an effect ampliﬁed in recA cells. The rescue of increased cell
length variability by RecA expression in deletion mutants, the effect of replication stalling induction on
cell lengths and recruitment of RecA to the DNA, all indicate a model of stochastic multi-fork replication
involving SOS response proteins. This could provide a mechanistic explanation of how growth rate
affects population cell length variability in E. coli.
