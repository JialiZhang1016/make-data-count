Abstract
Background: Patients with cardiovascular disease are at an increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However,
data on incident CKD in patients with multiple vascular comorbidities are insufficient. In this study, we identified
the predictors of CKD stages 3–5 in patients at risk of cardiovascular disease and used their estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR) to construct a nomogram to predict the 5-year risk of incident CKD.
Methods: Ambulatory data on 622 adults with preserved kidney function and one or more cardiovascular disease
risk factors who attended outpatient clinics at a tertiary care hospital in Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates were obtained
retrospectively. eGFR was calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation and
assessed every 3 months from baseline to December 12, 2017. Fine and Gray competing risk regression model was
used to identify the independent variables and construct a nomogram to predict incident CKD at 5 years, which is
defined as eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for ≥3 months. Time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the discrimination ability of the model. Calibration curves were applied to determine
the calibration ability and adjusted for the competing risk of death. Internal validation of predictive accuracy
was performed using K-fold cross-validation.
Results: Of the 622 patients, 71 had newly developed CKD stages 3–5 over a median follow-up of 96 months
(interquartile range, 86–103 months). Baseline eGFR, hemoglobin A1c, total cholesterol, and history of diabetes
mellitus were identified as significant predictors of CKD stages 3–5. The nomogram had good discrimination
in predicting the disease stages, with a time-dependent AUC of 0.918 (95% confidence interval, 0.846–0.964)
at 5 years, after internal validation by cross-validation.
Conclusions: This study demonstrated that incident CKD could be predicted with a simple and practical
nomogram in patients at risk of cardiovascular disease and with preserved kidney function, which in turn
could help clinicians make more informed decisions for CKD management in these patients.

Background
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of
death worldwide [1] and an important risk factor for
chronic kidney disease (CKD) [2]. A diminished esti-
mated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) has been shown
to increase the risk of CVD morbidity and mortality [3].
Approximately 1 in 10 people worldwide have CKD [4].
The marked increase in CKD prevalence over the past
two decades could be explained by the rising incidence
of chronic non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes
mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), obesity, and dyslip-
idemia [5, 6]. Much attention has been focused on the
significant observation that CVD risk and mortality in
patients with CKD is increased [7]. CVD and CKD share
numerous risk factors, which suggests that patients with
CVD also have an increased risk of CKD. CVD may pro-
mote the initiation and progression of CKD, for example,
through decreased renal perfusion due to atherosclerosis
of the renal arteries [2]. The National Kidney Foundation
Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines
recommend that the eGFR be calculated in patients at risk
for early detection of CKD and to prevent disease progres-
sion [8].
However, despite the increasing CVD prevalence, data
on CKD progression in patients at risk of CVD are
limited [3, 9]. Therefore, we aimed to assess the risk
of developing CKD stages 3–5 using baseline eGFR in
patients with vascular comorbidities and to develop a
nomogram to predict the 5-year risk of incident CKD
for clinical use.
Methods
Patients and procedures
This is a retrospective cohort study of United Arab
Emirates (UAE) nationals who visited the outpatient
clinics at Tawam Hospital between April 1, 2008, and
December 31, 2008, and had either CVD or one or more
CVD risk factors. Tawam Hospital is a state-funded ter-
tiary care facility located in Al Ain, UAE. This medical
center and its outpatient clinics serve a population of ap-
proximately 770,000, the majority of whom are UAE na-
tionals [10]. The study protocol was approved by Tawam
Hospital and the United Arab Emirates University re-
search and ethics board (IRR536/17). The requirement for
informed consent was waived because patient records and
information were anonymized and de-identified prior to
analysis.
Sociodemographic data and clinical information were
manually extracted from 1118 patients’ ambulatory
electronic medical records (EMRs) that were available
for review. Inclusion criteria for this study were UAE
nationals ≥18 years old with any of the following con-
ditions at baseline: HTN, CVD, DM, dyslipidemia, his-
tory of smoking, body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m2,
systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥120 mmHg, diastolic blood
pressure (DBP) ≥80 mmHg, serum glycosylated hemoglobin
A1c (HbA1c) ≥5.7%, serum triglycerides (TG) ≥2.26 mmol/
L, or serum total cholesterol (TC) ≥6.21 mmol/L.
Of the 749 eligible patients who met the inclusion criteria,
105 were excluded (60 had eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2,
6 were renal transplant recipients, and 39 had missing
data on baseline serum creatinine (SCr), TG, or HbA1c
levels) (Fig. 1). The eGFR was repeatedly assessed for
each patient every 3 months from baseline to December
12, 2017. Twenty-two patients had not undergone a re-
peat SCr measurement during the follow-up period;
they were considered to have been lost to follow-up
and thus were excluded from the final analysis. A total
of 622 patients with eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 were
finally enrolled in this study.
Definitions
BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height
(m2). Obesity was defined as BMI ≥30 kg/m2. Patients
receiving antihypertensive medications were considered
as having HTN. Similarly, patients with dyslipidemia
were those taking lipid-lowering medications, and pa-
tients with DM were those receiving antidiabetic medi-
cations. Smoking history was positive if there was a
current or any history of smoking tobacco. Patients were
considered to have vascular disease if they had a diagno-
sis of coronary heart disease (angina, prior myocardial
infarction, angioplasty of the coronary arteries, or coron-
ary artery surgery), cerebrovascular accident, or periph-
eral arterial disease. All-cause mortality was defined as
death from any cause.
Outcomes
In this study, CKD stages 3–5 were defined as eGFR <
60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for ≥3 months [8]. eGFR was calcu-
lated using the CKD Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-
EPI) creatinine equation [11]. All deaths were confirmed
through review of hospital records and death certificate
data. Non-CKD death, including death from CVD, can-
cers, and other causes, was classified as competing events.
Baseline and follow-up laboratory tests were per-
formed
at
Tawam
Hospital’s
Medical
Laboratory
Department. The Synchron Clinical System (UniCel
DxC-800; Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA) was
used to measure fasting lipid profile and SCr level by
standard methods, while HbA1c levels were assessed
using the automated analyzer Integra 400 Plus (Roche
Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). The recommended
manufacturer’s reference intervals for SCr level were 53–
115 μmol/L and 58–96 μmol/L for men and women,
respectively.

Statistical analyses
The baseline clinical variables and demographic data re-
corded in the patients’ EMRs and retrieved for analysis
were age; sex; history of DM, HTN, dyslipidemia, smok-
ing, and CVD; SBP; DBP; BMI; TC; TG; HbA1c; and
eGFR. The baseline characteristics of patients who did
and did not develop CKD stages 3–5 were compared
using the independent samples t-test for normally dis-
tributed continuous variables, the Mann-Whitney U test
for non-normally distributed continuous variables, and
Fisher’s exact test (two-tailed) for categorical variables.
We did not use any method of data imputation, and
missing covariate and dependent variable data were ex-
cluded from the analysis.
Time of follow-up for each patient was calculated from
the baseline visit in 2008 to either incident CKD, death,
or the last outpatient clinic visit, whichever occurred
first. Considering the potential bias due to the compet-
ing risk of non-CKD death, we used the Fine and Gray
regression model to adjust for the risk estimates of non-
CKD death as a competing risk [12]. The unadjusted
cumulative incidence function in the presence of com-
peting risk events was examined to compare the prob-
ability of failure over the follow-up period across eGFR
categories (i.e., 60–89 mL/min/1.73 m2, 90–99 mL/min/
1.73 m2, and ≥100 mL/min/1.73 m2).
Using the cmprsk package in R software [13], we con-
structed the prediction model with the following steps.
First, univariate Fine and Gray regression models were
used on all 14 candidate variables. Variables with a stat-
istical significance of the estimated regression coeffi-
cients of P > 0.2 were removed. Second, all significant
variables were included to develop the multivariate
model. Third, we constructed two CKD risk prediction
models: one based on all remaining variables and the
other using backward-stepwise selection. For each model,
sub-distribution hazard ratios (SHRs) and 95% confidence
intervals (95% CIs) were calculated to estimate the relative
risk. The proportional hazards assumption was assessed
by examining plots of the scaled Schoenfeld residuals
against time failure for the predictors. Multicollinearity
was evaluated by examining tolerance.
Moreover, two important components of predictive
accuracy, i.e., discrimination and calibration, were used
to evaluate the performance of the models [14]. The
evaluation was performed using the package survival
[15] and package ggplot2 in R [16]. Time-dependent
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(AUC) was employed to assess and compare the discrim-
inative ability of the two models [17, 18]. Larger AUC
values indicate better overall performance. An AUC of
0.5 indicates no predictive ability, whereas a value of 1
represents perfect predictive ability. The calibration plot,
which is obtained using cross-validation method, was
used to compare the predicted probability with the ob-
served probability in both models. Internal validation
of predictive accuracy was performed by applying a
cross-validation approach using 1000 splits of the data
into training and validation set. The prediction model
with
good
performance
was
implemented
into
a
nomogram using the mstate package and rms package
in R [19, 20].
All statistical analyses and data manipulations were per-
formed using R software version 3.5.2 (The R Foundation,
Vienna, Austria) and IBM®SPSS® software, version 25
(IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). All P values were
two-tailed, and P values < 0.05 were considered statisti-
cally significant.

Results
Baseline characteristics and follow-up
Table 1 presents the baseline characteristics of the co-
hort and compares these characteristics according to the
development of CKD stages 3–5 event. In our cohort of
622 patients, 71 (11.4%) had newly developed CKD
stages 3–5 over a median follow-up (interquartile range)
of 96 months (86–103 months). During the study period,
31 (5.0%) patients died (Fig. 1). The annual all-cause
mortality rate over the study period was 6.2 per 1000
individuals (95% CI, 4.4–8.7) per year. The mean age in
this study population was 52.38 ± 14.48 years, and half
were men. Approximately 60% of patients had hyperten-
sion, and almost half of the cohort had obesity. Around
one third had DM and 14% had a history of CVD at
baseline. The mean eGFR of the cohort was 98.99 ±
19.36 mL/min/1.73 m2. Moreover, patients with CKD stages
3–5 event were older at baseline; more frequently had a his-
tory of CVD, DM, HTN, and dyslipidemia; and had a
higher SBP, TG, and HbA1c, but had a lower DBP, TC,
and eGFR, than patients without CKD stages 3–5 event.
Baseline eGFR was found to be a strong predictor of
the development of CKD stages 3–5. After 8 years of fol-
low-up,
the
unadjusted
cumulative
probability
of
developing CKD stages 3–5 in the presence of com-
peting death events was 33.0% (95% CI, 25.9–40.2%),
7.8% (95% CI, 3.5–14.3%), and 1.1% (95% CI, 0.3–
3.0%) for patients with a baseline eGFR between 60
and 89 mL/min/1.73 m2, between 90 and 99 mL/min/
1.73 m2, and ≥100 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively (Fig. 2).
CKD risk prediction models
Univariate analyses, adjusted for competing risk events,
were used to regress the sub-distribution hazard of inci-
dent CKD stages 3–5 on all 14 candidate variables. All
variables, except for BMI, that were significant in the
univariate analysis (P ≤0.2) were entered into the multi-
variate prediction model; four variables were retained
after backward-stepwise selection (Table 2). The scatter
plots of the scaled Schoenfeld residuals against time fail-
ure revealed no substantial deviation from the propor-
tional hazard assumption. In addition, tolerance ranged
from 0.50 to 0.83, indicating an absence of multicolli-
nearity. In the multivariate prediction model, after step-
wise selection, a greater risk of incident CKD stages 3–5
was associated with history of DM, lower TC, lower
eGFR, and increasing HbA1c level.

Calibration, discrimination, and internal validation
Following internal validation by cross-validation, the
multivariate model after stepwise selection performed
better in terms of discrimination and calibration than
the multivariate model with all variables included. Time-
dependent AUC at 5 years was 0.918 (95% CI, 0.846–
0.964) in the multivariate model after stepwise selection
and 0.904 (95% CI, 0.853–0.945) in the full multivariate
model. Thus, the time-dependent AUC values of the
multivariate model after stepwise selection were better
than those of the full multivariate model (Fig. 3). The
calibration plots comparing actual risk and predicted
risk suggested underestimation in the lower risk group
and overestimation in the higher risk group in both
models (Fig. 4).
Nomogram
Multivariate Fine and Gray regression model after back-
ward-stepwise selection analysis was selected to build
the final prediction model, which identified eGFR, DM,
TC, and HbA1c as predictors of incident CKD. A prob-
ability nomogram for predicting CKD stages 3–5 within
5 years was constructed using the regression coefficients
from the model (Fig. 5). To read the nomogram, a verti-
cal line is drawn up to the points’ axis, and points are
assigned for each predictor. The total points are added
up, and a vertical line is drawn from the total points’ axis
down to the 5-Years CKD Probability axis, which yields
the patient’s overall risk of developing CKD stages 3–5
within 5 years.
The nomogram could be applied in the clinical setting
(Additional file 1). For example, a patient with a history
of DM, HbA1c of 9%, TC of 3 mmol/L, and eGFR of
65 mL/min/1.73 m2 would receive 4 points for the
DM, 7.5 points for the HbA1c, 10 points for the TC,
and 97.5 points for the eGFR (total = 119 points). The pa-
tient’s corresponding probability for developing CKD stages
3–5 at 5 years would be 65%.
Discussion
In this adult outpatient cohort with preserved kidney
function, the incidence of developing CKD stages 3–5
was approximately 1.4% per year. This finding was lower
than the 2–4% per year that was reported in a recent
systematic
review
that
investigated
CKD
incidence
among individuals with diabetes from 30 different coun-
tries [21]. The difference in the incidence was expected
because the proportion of patients with diabetes was
higher in the studies examined in the systematic review
than in our cohort. Our study also demonstrated that
among the traditional CVD risk factors, baseline eGFR,
HbA1c, TC, and history of DM are strong predictors of
CKD stages 3–5. Specifically, baseline eGFR is an im-
portant predictor of the development of these disease
stages in both the general and high-risk population, such
as patients with DM [21–25]. A decrease in GFR below

a critical level results in a vicious cycle of worsening kid-
ney function that contributes to HTN, which in turn
perpetuates further nephron loss [2].
Several studies have shown that older age, DM, smoking,
obesity, dyslipidemia, and HTN are independent risk fac-
tors for developing CKD stages 3–5 [22, 26–32]. From the
age of 50 years, the lifetime risk of developing incident
CKD is approximately 40% and could be even higher in the
presence of additional risk factors, such as obesity, high
blood pressure, or diabetes [33]. Interestingly, in our cohort
of patients at risk of CVD, DM and baseline eGFR were the
main predictors of CKD stages 3–5. Previous studies sug-
gested that high-risk patients are more likely to die from
CVD than develop kidney failure [7, 34, 35]; hence, survival
bias may play a role in the lack of statistical significance of
other risk factors in our study cohort. Nevertheless, the
competing risk of death was accounted for in our study.
Furthermore, DM has been shown to accelerate the pro-
gression of kidney function decline (2.1 and 2.7 mL/min/
1.73 m2/year, respectively, for women and men with DM)
[36] compared with essential HTN only (0.95 mL/min/year)
[37] or with older age (0.75–1 mL/min/1.73 m2/year) [38].
Thus, factors that have a greater influence on kidney func-
tion may also increase the risk of premature death and
therefore are important predictors of kidney failure. Our
study also noted an inverse relationship between low chol-
esterol levels and incident CKD. This paradoxical finding
could be explained by the confounding effects of malnutri-
tion and chronic inflammation that are common in patients
with CKD and end-stage renal disease [39].

Identification and risk stratification of CVD patients at
risk of developing CKD stages 3–5 are important issues
in clinical practice, particularly in outpatient clinics that
provide care to patients with multiple vascular comor-
bidities. Furthermore, active detection of CKD risk and
early treatment of risk factors may avoid complications
associated with the subsequent CKD stages [33]. How-
ever, only a few studies have focused on predicting the
risk of developing CKD stages 3–5 in patients at risk of
CVD [40], and currently, the models developed to

predict incident CKD require detailed laboratory and
clinical information [30, 41]. In our study, we propose a
simple and practical nomogram, which is based on four
easily available clinical variables (i.e., HbA1c, DM, TC,
and eGFR), to predict the incidence of CKD stages 3–5.
This nomogram may help busy physicians triage high-
risk patients toward more intensive testing and identify
those who need early referral to a nephrologist.
One of the strengths of this study is that the diagnosis
of CKD stages 3–5 was based on two consecutive read-
ings of eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, which were obtained
≥3 months apart. This could help account for intra-indi-
vidual variability in eGFR and lead to a more accurate
representation of kidney function. In addition, we used
the CKD-EPI equation to define the outcome, which is
more accurate than the Modification of Diet in Renal
Disease Study equation according to most studies [11,
42–44].
Moreover,
this
study
used
documented
anthropometric and laboratory measurements rather
than self-reported information for both predictor variables
and outcomes. Finally, standard receiver operating charac-
teristic curve analysis assesses the predictive ability of a
model within a fixed time horizon. In our study, we used
time-dependent AUC analysis to assess the predictive
accuracy of the nomogram at different time horizons.
This study has several limitations. First, other risk factors,
such as albuminuria, were not explored. A number of stud-
ies have described the significance of albuminuria in pre-
dicting the development of kidney failure [30, 41, 45–47];
however, non-nephrologist physicians in the UAE reported
that albuminuria is not routinely measured in their practice,
and nearly 80% of physicians use eGFR alone as a screening
tool for CKD [48]. Second, our sample size was modest
compared to that in other studies. Finally, although the pre-
dictive power of the nomogram developed was thoroughly
tested with internal validation, its applicability among a
non-UAE patient population at risk of CVD remains to be
investigated.
Conclusions
This study demonstrated that in patients at high cardio-
vascular risk, eGFR, HbA1c, TC, and a history of DM are
significant predictors of CKD stages 3–5. A simple and
practical nomogram with good accuracy was constructed
for predicting 5-year risk of developing CKD stages 3–5
based on competing risk model among patients with vas-
cular comorbidities. This user-friendly risk prediction tool
could help healthcare providers make better-informed
decisions regarding CKD prevention and management in
at-risk patients.
