Abstract
Background: The regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells is a complex process that involves epigenetic
modifications and the interaction of DNA with multiple transcription factors. This process can be studied with
unprecedented sensitivity using a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation and next-generation DNA
sequencing (ChIP-seq). Available ChIP-seq data can be further utilized to interpret new gene expression profiling
experiments.
Results: Here, we describe seqinspector, a tool that accepts any set of genomic coordinates from ChIP-seq or
RNA-seq studies to identify shared transcriptional regulators. The presented web resource includes a large
collection of publicly available ChIP-seq and RNA-seq experiments (>1300 tracks) performed on transcription factors,
histone modifications, RNA polymerases, enhancers and insulators in humans and mice. Over-representation is
calculated based on the coverage computed directly from indexed files storing ChIP-seq data (bigwig). Therefore,
seqinspector is not limited to pre-computed sets of gene promoters.
Conclusion: The tool can be used to identify common gene expression regulators for sets of co-expressed
transcripts (including miRNAs, lncRNAs or any novel unannotated RNAs) or for sets of ChIP-seq peaks to identify
putative protein-protein interactions or transcriptional co-factors. The tool is available at http://seqinspector.cremag.org.

Background
The regulation of gene expression is one of the most
complex processes in living organisms [1]. This process is a
result of interactions between core transcription factors,
additional regulators and chromatin architecture [2]. Coup-
ling chromatin immunoprecipitation with massive parallel
sequencing (ChIP-seq) has provided a breakthrough in the
analysis of gene-expression machinery. ChIP-seq data
released by the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements consortium
(ENCODE) [3] and other researchers have made it possible
to analyze the functional regulatory genome on an unpre-
cedented scale. The utilization of available ChIP-seq results
can provide insights into multiple lines of investigation,
including the search for molecular factors involved in the
control of coordinated expression of a particular set of
genes as well as for protein-protein interactions within
peaks resulting from new ChIP-seq experiments. Such
analyses require statistically oriented software to handle
large genomic data in a computationally efficient manner.
Here, we present seqinspector, a bioinformatics service
that utilizes up-to-date ChIP-seq data. Our tool allows
the functional enrichment of user-defined lists of genes,
transcripts and ChIP-seq peaks. The user is not limited
to a predefined set of promoter regions and can use any
set of genomic coordinates. Our tool provides solutions
for multiple challenges that have arisen with new
sequencing technologies. The first difficulty encountered
in interpreting RNA-seq experimental results is that the
output encodes multiple novel noncoding or un-annotated
transcripts that are not represented in current databases.
Another challenge that is often faced is the compatibility of
the tool with dynamic and continuously updated genome
annotations. Additionally, the tool should provide users the
opportunity to search for protein binding sites in regions

outside of gene promoters. For example, users might want
to search for specific proteins that bind to the introns of
differentially
spliced
genes
or
analyze
peak
regions
obtained from new ChIP-seq experiments. Therefore, we
eschewed the standard approach that uses gene annota-
tions directly or converts genomic coordinates to gene
annotations. Instead, our tool converts gene annotations
into genomic ranges. For this purpose, we developed a new
strategy for data storage, raw genomic bigwig tracks
instead of an SQL system. These tracks are analyzed every
time the user inputs a query. This method allowed us to
develop a new coverage-based approach to calculate
enrichment statistics.
Implementation
Storage of large collections of raw genomic files
Next-generation sequencing generates vast amounts of
data. The results are typically presented as signal infor-
mation (a per-base estimate across the genome) and as
discrete elements (regions computationally identified as
enriched from the signal). The most useful file formats
for storing ChIP-seq experimental results are bigwig and
bigbed for signal information and discrete elements
(peaks), respectively [4]. Both formats are binary and
indexed, and both can be used in the same way as tables
in database systems. Therefore, we developed a database
core using the bigwig file format instead of the SQL
database system. We used a client based on the source
code from the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) gen-
ome browser to navigate bigwig files [5]. This approach,
if parallelized, allows one to browse through multiple
coverage tracks in a relatively short amount of time.
Moreover, this strategy allows us to utilize raw data
downloaded from various resources without requiring
data transformation or reformatting. At the time of
writing this manuscript, the data collection contains 463
tracks from mice and 697 tracks from humans. These
data have been downloaded from various sources includ-
ing ENCODE [3], FANTOM5 [6] (345 tracks), Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) [7] (113 tracks) and the
Short Read Archive (SRA) (11 tracks).
A statistical test for the over-representation of ChIP-seq
defined DNA features
The decision to choose a storage method between raw
coverage (bigwig files) and peaks derived from ChIP-seq
data (bigbed files) was critical to further implementing
the system. Despite being computationally challenging,
raw coverage files were favored because they can be dir-
ectly used in visual explorations. Therefore, we used raw
coverage files to store the data. This process required a
different statistical approach than commonly imple-
mented in over-representation analyses that assume a
hypergeometric data distribution [8–10]. We decided to
use a parametric statistical test that allows a comparison
between the coverage means (length-normalized and
log-transformed) from genomic coordinates between
different samples. We implemented a two-sample t-test
to compare the ChIP-seq track coverages derived from
two samples of genomic ranges that were provided by
the user and the background set. By default, the
background set consists of 1000 random gene promoters
and can be replaced by the user-defined set. A statistic
based on the parametric z-score is used for a single-gene
exploration.
Seqinspector user interface
Based on previous experience with developing user inter-
faces for bioinformatics resources [11, 12], we decided to
minimize the number of possible options. The user must
select the genome assembly (between Mus musculus mm9
and mm10 and Homo sapiens hg19) and the query input
(Fig. 1a). The server automatically recognizes the type and
identification format. Some of the most popular identifica-
tion types are acceptable (Ensembl transcript ID, RefSeq
mRNA and gene symbol). The user can also input a gen-
omic range in both bed and genomic coordinate formats.
Moreover, it is possible to input multiple gene sets indi-
vidually and use one of them as the background. The
selected gene lists can be compared with the background
set using the “Statistics” button. As a result, the user will
obtain a list of ChIP-seq tracks sorted by statistical en-
richment. The following columns are present in the
output table: (1) Track name—internal identifier of the
track containing a short name of the transcription
factor; (2) Query—average coverage in the query set;
(3) Background—average coverage of the reference set;
(4) Fold difference—fold difference between the query
and reference; (5) P-value—the significance of the
difference between the query and reference datasets
(calculated by t-test); (6) Bonferroni—Bonferroni-cor-
rected P-value; (7) Stack plot—stacked plots presenting
the distribution of coverages in all query sets with
respective p-values; (8) Histogram– a visualization of
the average coverage (2000 bp around the center of the
genomic interval) for all query sets; (9) Genes—ge-
nomic intervals in the query set, symbols for nearest
genes
and
coverage
for
these
intervals;

Results
Common regulators of co-expressed genes
seqinspector can be used for different types of analyses.
One is to study clusters of co-expressed genes to find their
putative molecular regulators. To demonstrate this func-
tionality, we utilized the results from gene expression pro-
filing of mouse astroglial primary cultures treated with
dexamethasone [13]. Dexamethasone is an agonist of a

nuclear transcription factor, the glucocorticoid receptor
(GR). The list of 24 gene symbols for dexamethasone-
regulated
transcripts
was
submitted
to
seqinspector
(seqinspector.cremag.org) (see Additional file 1). The gen-
ome assembly was set as Mus musculus (mm9), and the
default background was used. seqinterpreter correctly
identified GR (P = 0.0024; Bonferroni corrected) as a true-
positive regulator of the genes from the list (see Table 1)
and provided a profile of the GR binding sites for each
analyzed gene.
Protein-protein interactions
seqinterpreter can be applied to study protein-protein
interactions. seqinterpreter calculates the average coverage
for all stored ChIP-seq tracks for the submitted genomic
ranges. The obtained coverages are then compared with a
reference dataset using a two-sample t-test followed by
correction for multiple testing. To demonstrate this func-
tionality, we utilized data from a ChIP-seq analysis of SP1
binding in GM12878 human lymphoblastoid cells (data
available at GEO GSM803363). We submitted the top 358
peaks (>3000 signal value) from this dataset to seqinterpr-
eter as genomic ranges in bed format (Additional file 2).
We submitted the lowest 358 peaks as background. We
used the Homo sapiens hg19 assembly. The transcription
factors ATF3, SP2, NFYA, NFYB, E2F4, IRF1 and SRF
indirectly bind to SP1 binding sites [14]. seqinspector
correctly identified the enrichment of the following
factors as interacting proteins: (1) ATF3 (P = 0.013), (2)
SP2 (P = 1.7 × 10-33), (3) NFYA (P = 8.9 × 10-47), (4)
NFYB (P = 9.6 × 10-41), (5) E2F4 (P = 1.8 × 10-16), (6)
IRF1 (P = 2.2 × 10-7) and (7) SRF (P = 1.2 × 10-6). The
tool identified also other transcription factors binding
to the same sites, including IRF3 (P = 3.0 × 10-43), C-
FOS (P = 4.0 × 10-42) and CHD2 (P = 6.8 × 10-41). All
of the presented P-values are Bonferroni corrected.
Cell type enrichment
Another straightforward application of seqinspector is
the study of transcript expression in various tissue and
cell types. For this purpose, tracks generated by the
FANTOM5 project using cap analysis of gene expression
were added to the seqinspector database (264 tracks for
human and 81 for mouse after manual curation). This
type of analysis reveals active transcription start sites
and gene variants expressed in particular cell popula-
tions. List of genes or transcripts derived from micro-
array
or
RNA-seq
profiling
experiments
can
be
inspected for cell-type-specific gene expression. To pro-
vide an example of this utility, we used results of gene
expression profiles in different cellular compartments of
the nervous system [15]. Submission of neuron- and
astrocyte-specific lists of genes (Additional file 3) con-
firmed cell-type enrichment and indicated which tran-
scriptional start sites are utilized in these two cell
populations (Fig. 2a). For astrocyte-specific genes, only
one significantly over-represented track was noted - the
Hippocampal Astrocytes CAGE track generated by the
FANTOM5 consortium (CNhs12129.11709-123B8, P =
0.0034). For neuron-specific genes, 14 over-represented
tracks were noted, including 13 FANTOM5 tracks gen-
erated from neural tissue or isolated neurons (e.g., Olfac-
tory brain, CNhs10489.18-22I9, P = 2.4 × 10-5 and Raphe
neurons, CNhs12631.11722-123D3, P = 3.1 × 10-4) and
one ENCODE track for the neuron-restrictive silencer
factor (NRSF, GSM915175, P = 0.026).
Another possible use of seqinspector is to estimate the
distribution of transcriptional alterations among various
cell populations, which may be estimated from results of
gene expression profiling in a heterogeneous tissue. To
demonstrate this functionality, we used a list of genes from
expression profiling in whole-blood samples obtained from
patients after ruptured intracranial aneurysms and a con-
trol group (Additional file 4) [16]. The lists of up-regulated
and down-regulated genes were compared against each
other. seqinspector identified over-representation of
CD8+
T-lymphocyte-specific
transcripts
among
the
down-regulated genes (CNhs12178.12191.129B4, P = 0.005)
and neutrophil-specific genes among the up-regulated
genes (CNhs10862.11233.116C9, P = 0.12) (Fig. 2b). All of
the presented P-values are Bonferroni corrected.
Comparison with other tools
To demonstrate the effectiveness of seqinspector, we com-
pared this tool with available ChIP-seq data-based online
tools (CSCAN [10], ENCODE ChIP-Seq Significance Tool
[17] and Enrichr with ENCODE ChIP-seq and ChIP-x
gene set libraries [18]) as well as tools based on in silico

predicted transcription factor binding sites (oPOSSUM
3.0 [19] and Cremag [12]). For this purpose, we used the
following five example sets of genes regulated by various
transcriptional mechanisms. One from each tool exclud-
ing Enrichr (no list of genes with specified transcriptional
factor was provided with this tool): (a) an example gene
set provided in this paper—GR-dependent genes regulated
in mouse; (b) a list of human genes regulated by dexa-
methasone from the ENCODE ChIP-Seq Significance
Tool website; (c) BDP1 target gene set from the CSCAN
website; (d) liver-specific gene set from the oPOSSUM 3.0
website and (e) a list of genes regulated by SRF from the
Cremag website. We converted the original lists into
Ensembl Transcript IDs and gene symbols using Biomart
[20] to meet the tool-specific input requirements. We
used the default settings for all of the tools for the
comparison. As a score, we used the rank of the expected
transcription factor in the obtained results, where the
points one to ten were awarded with a maximum given
for the first position on the list (Fig. 3). seqinspector
received the highest summary score (score = 40) followed
by Enrichr using ENCODE data (score = 37) and oPOS-
SUM 3.0 (score = 27). Thus, the seqinspector tool, which
is based on parametric statistics for enrichment calcula-
tion, was comparable to other promoter analysis methods.
All of the gene sets with the original IDs, RefSeq num-
bers, promoter sequences and results are provided in

Discussion
Comparative genomic studies suggest that 3 to 8 % of the
sequence information in a genome is evolutionarily con-
served among mammals [21]. Earlier in silico approaches
to predict transcription factor binding sites were limited to
those specific regions [22]. However, the ENCODE project
found that the vast majority (~80 %) of the genome can be
annotated with RNA- or chromatin-associated features (3).
Therefore, the level of potentially functional genomic re-
gions may be significantly higher than previously thought.
seqinspector provides the possibility to search for func-
tional elements with high confidence within unconserved
genomic regions, offering a significant advantage over
systems based on in silico-computed transcription factor
binding sites.
Another
advantage of
ChIP-seq–based
enrichment services is the ability to search for distant
enhancer transcription factors through indirect binding to

promoter regions. Enhancer regions can be distant (even
up to 200 kb) from the proximal promoter of a target gene
[23]. To demonstrate this advantage, we assessed seqin-
spector using a set of genes regulated by the enhancer
transcription factor GR.
A unique feature of seqinspector is that it accepts
any set of genomic coordinates. Therefore, the tool
can be used to identify common gene expression
regulators for sets of co-expressed transcripts (includ-
ing miRNAs, lncRNAs and any novel un-annotated
RNAs) or for sets of ChIP-seq peaks to identify
putative protein-protein interactions or transcriptional
co-factors. Our software enables the study of tran-
script expression in various tissues and cell types
using FANTOM5 CAGE data. Therefore, it is possible
to identify the enrichment of cell-type-specific genes
or transcripts. The seqinspector software package can
also be used in more creative ways; for example, the
user can compare the characteristics of 5’ untrans-
lated
region
(UTR)
histone
modifications
between
two sets of transcripts. We are continuously adding
new ChIP-seq experiments to the database. seqinspec-
tor is not easily outdated; any novel genomic features
(e.g., genes, miRNAs or ChIP-seq peaks) can be used
if their genomic positions are known. Even after
major assembly changes in databases, the new gen-
omic ranges can be translated to the old versions of
the genome assembly using the liftover tool. This
mechanism is currently built into seqinspector for the
mouse mm10 assembly.
Conclusions
The seqinspector tool was developed to facilitate the func-
tional annotation and discovery of transcription factor
binding sites on promoters of co-expressed transcripts,
signals from ChIP-seq experiments and any other set of
genomic coordinates sharing a common trait. The pre-
sented web resource includes a large collection of publicly
available ChIP-seq experiments (>1100 tracks) performed
on transcription factors, histone modifications, RNA
polymerases and insulators in humans and mice.
