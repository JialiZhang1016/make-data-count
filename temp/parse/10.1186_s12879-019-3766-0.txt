Abstract
Background: Clinical characteristics (taxonomy, virulence genes and antimicrobial resistance ) of Aeromonas in
isolated from extra-intestinal and intestinal infections were investigated to describe epidemiology, associated
virulence factors and optimal therapy options.
Methods: Clinical samples (n = 115) of Aeromonas were collected from a general hospital in Beijing between the
period 2015 and 2017. Taxonomy was investigate by Multilocus phylogenetic analysis (MLPA), 10 putative virulence
factors by use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antimicrobial resistance to 15 antibiotics by use of the
microbroth dilution method.
Results: The most common species of Aeromonas detected in samples of intestinal tract included; A. caviae (43.9%),
A. veronii (35.7%), and A. dhakensis (12.2%). Prevalent species of Aeromonas collected from extra-intestinal infections
included; A. hydrophila (29.4%), A. caviae (29.4%), and A. dhakensis (23.5%). A. hydrophila were detected in 1% of
stool samples and 29.4% (5/17) of extra-intestinal infections. A. hydrophila strains in extra-intestinal infections were
related to malignancy. The most common medical conditions among patients with Aeromonas infections included
malignancy and liver-transplant related cholecystitis. Multiple drug resistance (MDR) was prevalent in extra-intestinal
isolates (82.3%, 14/17) and was greater than the prevalence in intestinal isolates (30.6%, 30/98) (P < 0.05). Resistant
rates of extra-intestinal isolates were 70.6, 35.3, 23.5 and 5.9% for ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and
imipenem, respectively, and were higher than found in previous studies. Despite differences in the number and
type of virulence genes among samples of Aeromonas, no significant correlation was found between invasion and
virulent genes in intestinal or extra-intestinal infections.
Conclusions: Overall results of this study support a role for Aeromonas spp. as a potential causative infectious agent
of gastroenteritis, and malignancy, liver cirrhosis, post liver transplantation in immunocompromised patients. A.
hydrophila was more prevalent in samples of extra-intestinal infections when compared to samples of intestinal
infections, and was especially prominent in samples of patients presenting with malignancy. Aeromonas isolates
from extra-intestinal samples had high rates of drug resistance but 3rd generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones
and aminoglycosides remain as options to treat severe diarrhea. However, increasing MDR of extra-intestinal
infection samples warrants monitoring.

Background
The genus Aeromonas is a common, gram-negative, faculta-
tive anaerobe, coccobacillary-to-bacillary bacteria that be-
longs to Aeromonadaceae [1].The genus Aeromonas is
comprised of mesophiles and psychrophiles which can cause
a number of diseases to warm and cold-blooded animals [2].
Recently, mesophilic Aeromonas have received increased at-
tention as an emergent agent of foodborne illness [3]. In
humans, Aeromonas can cause extra-intestinal diseases, es-
pecially in immunocompromised individuals, including septi-
cemia,
wound
infections,
urinary
tract
infections,
hepatobiliary tract infections and necrotizing fasciitis [4].
Aeromonas have a complex taxonomy and the genus is
comprised of over 30 species, however their identification
has been limited by use of conventional biochemical identi-
fication methods such as matrix-assisted laser desorption/
ionization time of flight masss spectrometry (MALDI-TOF
MS), and 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequen-
cing [5–8]. To this end, the use of 5 or more housekeeping
genes has been demonstrated as an effective approach for
multilocus phylogenetic analysis (MLPA) and species iden-
tification of Aeromonas spp. [5, 9]. In addition, MLPA has
been recommended for the verification of taxonomic affili-
ation by genome sequencing before being submitted to the
NCBI database [10]. Current literature indicates that A.
hydrophila, A. veronii bv sobria, and A. caviae are respon-
sible for the majority of human infections and clinical isola-
tions [11]. However, caution must be exercised as A.
dhakensis can be misidentified as A. hydrophila by use of
some phenotypic methods [12] and MLPA is suggeted for
molecular subtyping [13, 14].
A. dhakensis was initially described as a A. hydrophila
subspecies in 2002, and A. aquariorum described later,
and was recommended to be reclassified as a separate
species in 2012 [15].
The pathogenesis of Aeromonas spp. involves a series
of virulence factors [16]. Haemolytic toxins include: aero-
lysin-related cytotoxic enterotoxin (Act) [17], heat-labile
cytotonic enterotoxin (Alt), heat-stable cytotonic toxins
(Ast) [18], hemolysin (HlyA) and aerolysin (AerA) [19]. In
addition, the type III secretion system (TTSS) [20], polar
flagellum (fla), lateral flagella (laf) [21, 22], elastase (Ela)
[23] and lipase (Lip) [24] contribute to the pathogenicity
of Aeromonas.
Most
cases
of
diarrheal
due
to
Aeromonads
are
self-limiting and treatment with oral or intravenous fluids is
effective. However, patients with serious diarrhea or
extra-intestinal infection should receive an antimicrobial
treatment [2]. Previously, Aeromonas has been observed as
resistant to ampicillin, while 3rd generation cephalosporin,
fluoroquinolone and aminoglycosides demonstrated excel-
lent antimicrobial activity to Aeromonas species isolated
from clinical sources [14, 25–27]. However, extensive use of
antibiotics in aquaculture and human treatment has led to
increasing resistance in bacterium to antimicrobial drugs.
Therefore it is prudent to monitor the development of anti-
microbial resistance in species of Aeromonas to common
clinical treatment options.
In the presented study, we investigated characteristics
of strains of Aeromonas isolated from intestinal infec-
tions and extra-intestinal infection. Furthermore we
evaluated virulence associated genes and antimicrobial
resistance of species of Aeromonas.
Materials and methods
Isolates of Aeromonas
Overall, 1286 stool samples were collected from adults over
14 years old presenting with acute diarrhea at a general hos-
pital in Beijng, China, between June and July 2015, 2017. Epi-
demiology related medical records were completed to assess
clinical history and physical fitness of patients (Additional file
1). Samples of Stool were enriched in alkaline peptone water
broth (Beijing landbrige, China) for 8 h at 37 °C, and a loop
of the resulting mixture was subcultured on a blood agar
plate (Oxoid, UK) supplemented with 20% ampicillin (Sigma,
USA) for 16–24 h at 37 °C [28]. An oxidase test (BioMer-
ieuX, France) was performed to select the colonies which
were different from Enterobacteriaceae. Microorganisms
were identified by use of an automatic bacteriologic analyzer
(VITEK2 Compact, BioMerieuX, France). Salmonella spp,
Shigella spp and Vibrio spp were also detected on a routine
basis. simultaneously.
Extra-intestinal infections due to Aeromonas were moni-
tored and the strains were isolated between 2015 and 2017.
Clinical samples of blood or bile were cultured in a BACTEC
FX400 (BD Diagnostic Instrument Systems, USA). Samples
positive for Aeromonas were simultaneously subcultured on
a blood agar plate and a Maconkey agar plate (BioMerieuX,
France). Identification of the isolated microorganisms was
completed by use of an automatic bacteriologic analyzer
(VITEK2 Compact, BioMerieuX, France). Concurrently,
medical records of the patients with extra-intestinal infec-
tions due to species of Aeromonas were reviewed and age,
gender, underlying conditions, microbiological findings and
outcome were assembled.
Strains were stored in a Luria broth: glycerol mixture
(80:20) at −80 °C until identification was performed.
Molecular identification and subtyping of Aeromonas
isolates
Molecular identification and subtyping of Aeromonas iso-
lates was completed by use of 16S rRNA sequencing and
MLPA. Total chromosomal DNA from Aeromonas was
prepared by use of the DNA purification kit (Tiangen Bio-
tech, China) as specified by the manufacturer. PCR ampli-
fication was performed by use of 2 × Taq PCR MasterMix
(Tiangen Biotech, China). Primers synthesis and sequen-
cing of PCR products were conducted (Shanghai Sangon
Zhou et al. BMC Infectious Diseases          (2019) 19:158 
Page 2 of 9
Biotech, China). Due to the limitations of molecular iden-
tification by 16S rRNA sequencing, phylogenetic analysis
of the seven selected housekeeping genes gyrB, rpoD, recA,
dnaJ, gyrA, dnaX and atpD was completed to identify
strains of Aeromonas. Primers [5] used for PCR amplifica-
tion are provided in Additional file 2. Concatenated
7-gene phylogenetic trees were constructed and compared
with representative species by use of MLPA as previously
described [5]. Unrooted neighbour-joining phylogenetic
trees were prepared by use of MEGA 5.0 software with
Bootstrap values calculated by use of 1000 replicates.
Detection of virulence-associated genes
The presence of 10 genes encoding virulence factors was
determined by use of PCR. Primers are listed in Additional
file 2, including alt [29], ast [30], hlyA, aerA, act, ascF-G
of TTSS, laf [14], lip, fla, and ela [31]. PCR amplification
reactions were performed at a final volume of 40 μl, con-
taining 20 μl of Taq PCR MasterMix (2×), 1 μl 10 μM pri-
mer, 1 μl DNA template (~ 30-40 ng), and 17 μl ddH2O.
Cycling conditions consisted of an initial single cycle at
95 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at
95 °C for 30 s, annealing was completed at 55 °C–60 °C for
30 s, elongation was completed at 72 °C for 1 min and
followed by a final cycle at 72 °C for 7 min. The PCR prod-
ucts were sequenced for further confirmation.
Antibiotic susceptibility test
Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed by use of the
microbroth dilution method according to guidelines of the
current Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI).
Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of strains of
Aeromonas strains to 15 antibiotics were determined and in-
cluded; gentamycin (GEN), imipenem (IPM), ampicillin
(AMP), cefoxitin (FOX), ceftriaxone (CRO), amoxicillin-cla-
vulanate (AMC), nalidixic acid (NAL), ciprofloxacin (CIP),
chloramphenicol (CHL), tetracycline (TCY), doxycycline
(DOX), azithromycin (AZM), cefepime (FEP), sulfonamides
(Sas) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT). E. coli
ATCC 25922 was used as the quality-control strain for sus-
ceptibility testing.
Definitions
Multiple drug resistance (MDR) was was defined as ac-
quired non-susceptibility to at least one agent in three or
more antimicrobial categories, according the criteria for
defining MDR, XDR and PDR in Enterobacteriaceae [32].
Intestinal infections related to a strain of Aeromonas
were diagnosed as patients presenting with acute diar-
rhea and a sample culture positive for a strain of Aero-
monas. Extra-intestinal infections related to a strain of
Aeromonas were diagnosed as patients presenting with
inflammation in a region not identified as intestinal and
a sample culture positive for a strain of Aeromonas.
Statistical methods
Data were analyzed by use of the x2 test and Fisher’s
exact test (SPSS 15.0), When P < 0.05 results were con-
sidered statistically significant.
Results
Clinical features
Aeromonas spp. were identified as the causative agent of
diarrhea in 98 (7.6%) of 1286 patients. Clinical and epi-
demiological characteristics were shown in Additional
file 3. Gender ratio (male: female) was 0.94 (46/49)
among 98 patiens presenting with diarrhea caused by
strains of Aeromonas. Sources of infections were largely
unknown and likely originate from contaminated food.
However, 3% of patients identified seafood, cooked food
or frozen drinks as likely sources. Twenty percent of pa-
tients presented with vomiting, 35.8% abdominal pain,
11.6% fever (body temperature ≥37.7 °C), and 9.1% had
mild dehydration. Approximately 70% of patients pre-
senting with diarrhea caused by a strain of Aeromonas
had loose stools for ≥3 times per day, 29.4% had watery
stools, and 1.0% had mucus-like stool. Erythrocytes and
leukocytes were present in 28.4 and 11.6% of samples of
stool collected from patients infected by strains of Aero-
monas when observed by use of high magnification (HP,
× 40). In addition, 6.3% of stool samples presented with
erythrocytes and leukocytes. Infection of patients by
other enteropathogens was observed in three patients
(3/98, 3.1%). Combinations of infectious species in-
cluded; Salmonella typhimurium with A.caviae, Vibrio
fluvialis with A. veronii and Vibrio parahaemolyticus
with A. veronii.
Between 2015 and 2017, 17 strains of Aeromonas caus-
ing extra-intestinal infections were identified (Table 1 and
Additional file 4). With the excepted for 3 children accept-
ing a liver transplant (age < 4 years), the average age of the
14 patients was 58.5 years old. The gender ratio (male: fe-
male) was 1.83 (11/6). None of the 17 patients were ICU
admissions nor was there any acute respiratory failure or
mortality. Six (35.3%) patients suffered from Aeromonas--
related cholecystitis following a liver transplant and 6
(35.3%) pantients presented with malignant tumors. Over-
all, the most common underlying conditions of patients
presenting with Aeromonas infections were liver trans-
plantation and malignancy (12/17), In addition, patients
presenting with Aeromonas related infections were associ-
ated with increased prevalence of lung cancer in our
study.
Eleven patients presented with monomicrobial related
Aeromonas infections, and 6 patients presented with poly-
microbial Aeromonas infections (Table 1). Of polymicro-
bial infections, two consisted of A.caviae and Klebsiella
pneumoniae; and two were A.aquariorum with Klebsiella
pneumoniae. One patient presented with A.aquariorum

and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and one patient with
A.veronii and Proteus mirabilis. Klebsiella pneumoniae
was the most common combined pathogen (66.7%, 4/6).
Genotyping of species of Aeromonas
Results of MLPA performed with the concatenated 7-gene
phylogenetic tree analysis classified 113 of 115 (98.3%)
Aeromonas isolates to 8 different species (Fig. 1). The four
most prevalent species of Aeromonas were A. caviae
(41.7%), A. veronii (31.3%), A. dhakensis (13.9%), and A.
hydrophila (5.2%). As presented in Table 2, comparative
analysis of genotyping demonstrated differences between
intestinal and extra-intestinal isolates was completed. Over-
all, there was a significant difference in the assemblage of
isolates as intestinal isolates generally contained species of
A. caviae (43.9%), A. veronii (35.7%), and A. dhakensis
(12.2%). In contrast, extra-intestinal isolates generally con-
tained A. hydrophila (29.4%), A. caviae (29.4%), and A. dha-
kensis (23.5%). There was significant difference between
intestinal and extra-intestinal isolates for the species A. ver-
onii and A. hydrophila (P < 0.05, x2 test). Five of 6 strains of
A. hydrophila were isolated from patients with solid tu-
mors, while only 1 strain of A. hydrophila was associated
with an intestinal infection.
Distribution of virulence genes in strains of Aeromonas
Presence of multiple virulence genes was common among
isolates of Aeromonas and 40 virulence combinations of
10 putative virulence genes were identified. The predom-
inant combination (i.e. pattern) of virulence genes was
alt/ela/lip/fla (pattern1), which presented in 27.0% of
patients presenting with an infection related to a isolate of
Aeromonas. In addition, the patterns of act/fla (pattern 2),
alt/ela/lip (pattern 3) and act/ascF-G/fla (pattern 4) were
prevalent among patients.. As presented in Table 3, the
pattern of virulence genes varied among genus’s. Of the
four most prevalent species, the haemolytic genes act was
prevalent in A. veronii and A. dhakensis. The haemolytic
genes hlyA was prevalent in A. hydrophila and A. dhakensis,
and the haemolytic genes aerA was more prevalent in A.
dhakensis. The enterotoxin gene ast was identified primarily
in A. hydrophila. The enterotoxin gene alt, extracellular pro-
tease genes ela and lip were less prevalent in A. veronii. The
TTSS genes (ascF-G) was prevalent in A. hydrophila. A. vero-
nii carried pattern 2 and 4 and A. caviae carried pattern1
and 3. The species A. dhakensis and A. hydrophila had di-
verse virulence patterns, 93.3% A. dhakensis and 100% A.
hydrophila had 5 or more virulence genes.
Susceptibility to antimicrobials
Resistance profiles of the 115 Aeromonas isolates to 15 anti-
microbial agents were shown in Table 4. High resistance to
ampicillin (93.9%) and Nalidixic acid (54.8%) was observed
in Aeromonas isolates. The majority of isolates (≥80%) were
susceptible to chloramphenicol, gentamicin and the new
generation antibiotics ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, cefepime,
imipenem, sulfonamides, trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole,
doxycycline and azithromycin. Resistance was most prevalent
for ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, ceftriax-
one, sulfonamides, gentamicin and azithromycin in A. hydro-
phila, as a resistance of 66.7, 100.0, 66.7, 66.7, 50.0, 50.0, and
66.7% was observed, respectively. Higher rates of resistance

to cefoxitin was also observed in A. dhakensis (87.5%). Only
3 strains exhibited resistance to imipenem, all of which were
identified as belonging to A. dhakensis. Significantly higher
rates of resistance to 10 antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, nalidixic
acid, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, cefepime,
sulfonamides, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,
gentamicin
and azithromycin) were found among extra-intestinal isolates
when compared with intestinal isolates (P < 0.05, x2 test).
Of the 115 strains, 33 strains (28.7%) exhibited 35
multiple-drug resistance (MDR) patterns to 15 anti-
microbial agents. Eighty-three percent (5/6) of strains of
A. hydrophila and 81.2% (13/16) of strains of A. dhaken-
sis presented with MDR, while less MDR isolates were
found in A.caviae (39.6%, 19/48) and A.veronii (16.7%,
6/36). Intestinal strains (30.6%, 30/98) presented with
significantly less rates of MDR when compare to isolates
from extra-intestinal strains (82.3%, 14/17), indicating
acquisition of MDR was likely from in the hospital.
Discussion
In the presented study, 115 isolates of Aeromonas were
collected from a general hospital in Beijing between 2015
and 2017. Overall, the abundance and prevalence of
strains of Aeromonas were different between intestinal
and extra-intestinal infections. In our study, 1% of samples
isolated from samples of stool of patients with intestinal
infection were positive for A. hydrophila, while in 29.4%
of extra-intestinal infections. Thus, results of this study in-
dicated that the A. hydrophila was not the primary patho-
gen contributing to acute gastroenteritis, however it was
more prevalent in extra-intestinal infections when com-
pared to samples from patients with intestinal infections.
Interestingly, 5 strains of A. hydrophila strains from
extra-intestinal infections were present in patients pre-
sented with malignant tumor. These results might indicate
a preference of strains of A. hydrophila and other Aeromo-
nas spp. to colonize differently. A. veronii was more com-
mon
in
samples
of
patients
presenting
with
acute
gastroenteritis (35.7%) but was rare in patients with
extra-intestinal infections (5.9%), which was similar to
previous results [14, 33].
In addition, results of our study demonstrate a potential
relationship between Aeromonas and clinical cirrhosis or ma-
lignancy as previously reported [34, 35] and liver-transplant
related cholecystitis. These results might be related to bacter-
ial translocation, use of antacids [35] or immunosuppressive
agents following liver transplantation.
Prevalence of antimicrobial-resistance was greater in
extra-intestinal isolates when compared to the previous
study. In our study, rates of resistance to ceftriaxone, cip-
rofloxacin, gentamicin and imipenem was 70.6, 35.3, 23.5
and 5.9%, while a study completed in Taiwan was 7.7, 6,
3.3 and 1.1%, respectively [36] . Additionally, a study com-
pleted in Korea the rates of resistance were 15.5, 10.1, 7.1
and 9.8%, respectively [11]. When compared with the rates
of intestinal isolates, the rate of MDR in extra-intestinal
isolates was greater. These findings indicate selective pres-
sures in hospitals on strains of infectious bacteria due to
the extensive use of antimicrobial agents and warrants
more attention in the future.
In our study, two bacteremia-related Aeromonas species
were identified; A. media and A. dhakensis. These results
were different from previous results where A. caviae was
identified as bacteremia-related Aeromonas species in
(See figure on previous page.)

Japan, A. hydrophila and A. veronii biovar sobria in
Taiwan, and A. hydrophila and A. caviae in Korea and
Taiwan [11, 36].
A study completed in Southern India reported a resistance
rate to ceftriaxone resistant of 31% (9/29) for isolates of
Aeromonas from samples of stool [37]. In our study resist-
ance rates for ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin and
imipenem were 5.1, 1.0, 2.0 and 2.0% in Aeromonas isolates
of patients presenting with diarrhea and were similar to rates
in Shanghai (5.7, 3.6, 0.5, and 2.6%, respectively) [14]. These
results along with results of the study competed in Shanghai
indicate that 3rd generation cephalosporins, fluoroquino-
lones and aminoglycosides are a treatment option for severe
diarrhea but not for extra-intestinal infections originating in
Eastern China.
It is important to note that only 3 strains exhibited re-
sistance to imipenem, all of which belonged to the genus
A. dhakensis. The genus A. dhakensis should be the
focus of future research as they harbored high numbers
of virulence genes, high rates of drug resistance and a
high degree of infection in intestinal and extra-intestinal
samples. In addition, A. hydrophila presented with a
high number of virulence genes and high rates of drug
resistance. A. hydrophila have previously been isolated
from wounds in two cases as reported by Christopher J.
Grim et al. [38], and were classified as having MDR and
multiple virulence genes.
In the presented study, Klebsiella pneumoniae was the
most common combined pathogen. These results demon-
strate that cholecystitis post Liver transplant predisposed
patients to polymicrobial Aeromonas infections, while ma-
lignant cancers, such as rectal cancer, might predispose pa-
tients to monomicrobial Aeromonas infection. A previous
study in Taiwan found that E. coli was the most common
pathogen (42%) in polymicrobial infections, then Klebsiella
spp. (24%) [35]. Conversely, cirrhosis predisposed patients
to monomicrobial Aeromonas bacteremia while malignant
cancer predisposed patients to polymicrobial Aeromonas
bacteremia [35]. This difference indicates a high degree of
heterogeneity in the distribution of intestinal bacteria, and
region specific presence of Aeromonas infections.
The pathogenic mechanism of Aeromonas was multi-
factorial and complex, and likely involves a series of

virulence genes involved in this process. Despite Aeromo-
nas harboring different numbers and types of virulence genes,
there was no significant correlation found between infection
and virulent genes of Aeromonas in intestinal infections and
extra-intestinal infections. For example, intestinal infections,
alt have been reported as associated with loose stool, alt plus
ast with watery stools, and act with bloody diarrhea [39]. In
the presented study, 3 watery stool samples were associated
with ast, however 25 samples of watery stool were not. In
addition, a relationship between infection and presence of
virulent genes was not observed and might be related to the
limited number of strains isolated in extra-intestinal infections.
Similarly, a study completed by Wu et al. found no association
between the presence of the genes aerA, hlyA, alt, ast, ascFG
in isolates of Aeromonas and development of extra-intestinal
infections or bacterium [34].
In conclusion, Aeromonas spp. should be considered as a
causative infectious agent in immunocompromised patients
especially those presenting with malignancy, liver cirrhosis
and following a liver transplant. In addition, A. hydrophila
was more prevalent in extra-intestinal infections when
compared to intestinal infections, especially for patients
presenting with a malignancy. Extra-intestinal Aeromonas
isolates possessed higher rates of drug resistance. However,
3rd generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and ami-
noglycosides remain as effective treatments for patients
presenting with severe diarrhea but not for extra-intestinal
infections. In addition, increasing prevalence of drug resist-
ance and MDR in extra-intestinal isolates of Aeromonas re-
quires attention and further monitoring.
