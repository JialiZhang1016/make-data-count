The spin state transition from low spin to high spin upon substrate addition is one of the key
steps in cytochrome P450 catalysis. External perturbations such as pH and hydrogen bonding
can also trigger the spin state transition of hemes through deprotonated histidine (e.g.
Cytochrome c). In this work, we report the isolated 2-methylimidazole Cobalt(II) [Co(TPP)
(2-MeHIm)]
and
[Co(TTP)(2-MeHIm)],
and
the
corresponding
2-methylimidazolate
derivatives where the N−H proton of axial 2-MeHIm is removed. Interestingly, various
spectroscopies including EPR and XAFS determine a high-spin state (S = 3/2) for the
imidazolate derivatives, in contrast to the low-spin state (S = 1/2) of all known imidazole
analogs. DFT assisted stereoelectronic investigations are applied to understand the metal-
ligand interactions, which suggest that the dramatically displaced metal center allowing a
promotion eg(dπ) →b1g(dx2y2) is crucial for the occurrence of the spin state transition.

pin state transition of hemes that is usually accompanied by
metal displacement and conformational changes widely
exists in biochemical processes, e.g., oxygenation of myo-
globin (5c, HS (5c = ﬁve-coordinate, HS = high-spin) towards 6c,
LS (6c = six-coordinate, LS = low-spin))1,2, and the starting step
of Cytochrome p450 catalysis (6c, LS towards 5c, HS)3,4, both
involved with ligand (un)binding. Besides this, spin state transition
can also be controlled by (weak) external perturbations such as pH
and hydrogen bonding5. The proximal His18 of Cytochrome c (or
microperoxidases) can be deprotonated at high pH (> 11) to
trigger the pH-dependent spin state transition (HS towards LS)5–7.
Although the alkaline transition has been studied for decades,
questions remain regarding the nature of the trigger group that on
deprotonation initiates the electronic and conformational change
in the native molecule6. Similarly, the hydrogen bonding between
Asp and proximal histidine in oxygen activating heme enzymes
(i.e., peroxidases) contributes to negative imidazolate character to
promote heterolytic cleavage of the O−O bond to form a ferryl
species8–10. The origin of the process and electronic structural
changes whereby enzymes reorganize their active site through
external perturbations is still poorly understood. Porphyrin system
has been used to investigate the impact of external perturbations
for various advantages, including the isolable active site where the
spin state transition happens11. Hydrogen bonding with axial
chloride has been found to control the spin state of iron(III)
octaethyltetraarylporphyrin chloride to switch between high (S =
5/2) and intermediate spin (S = 3/2)12. To imitate the deprotonated
histidine or the extreme case of strong hydrogen bonding, imi-
dazolate, which is produced by removing the hydrogen of imi-
dazole to give stronger σ and π donation, has been exploited13,14.
Scheidt and coworkers15 have applied this idea in the studies of
iron(II) porphyrinates where Mössbauer characterizations have
revealed two different HS conﬁgurations, a complete spin state
transition however is not seen.
In this work, we report the spin state transitions of synthetic
metalloporphyrins, which are achieved through imidazole(ate)
ligands that directly interact with the metal centers. The unex-
pected high-spin state of imidazolate cobalt(II) porphyrinates, as
well as the incomplete spin state transition of iron(II) analogs15,
pose questions on the stronger ligand nature of imidazolate than
imidazole.
Results
Single crystal structures. Cobalt and iron hemes are analogous in
many
aspects,
including
the
oxygen
bonding
ability16–18.
Recently, we have reported the [Co(TpivPP)(R-Im)(O2)] (R-Im:
1-EtIm or 2-MeHIm; TpivPP = α, α, α, α-tetrakis(o-pivalami-
dophenyl)porphyrinato) complexes using imidazole cobalt(II)
porphyrinates as the starting material, which are all ﬁve-
coordinate due to the destabilization of the six-coordinate com-
pound by the singly populated dz2 orbital19. Remarkably all the
imidazole cobalt(II) porphyrinates are low-spin state (3d7, S = 1/
2) regardless of the steric hindrance of the axial ligands20. This is
contrasted to iron(II) analogs, the use of hindered imidazole is
necessary to prepare the ﬁve-coordinate iron(II) porphyrinates,
all of which known so far are high-spin (3d6, S = 2)21.
Here, we report the ﬁrst examples of imidazolate ligated
Co(II) porphyrinates [K(222)][Co(TPP)(2- MeIm−)] (222 =
4,7,13,16,21,24-hexaoxa-1,10-diazabicyclo
[8.8.8]
hexacosane)
and
[K(222)][Co(TTP)
(2-MeIm−)]
(TPP = tetraphenylpor-
phyrin, TTP = tetratolylporphyrin), which are prepared by the
reaction between [Co(TPP)] (or [Co(TTP)]) and [K(222)][(2-
MeIm−)] (cryptand 222 is used to stabilize the K+ cation)
(Supplementary Figs. 1–4). Two corresponding imidazole deri-
vatives [Co(TPP)(2-MeHIm)] and [Co(TTP)(2-MeHIm)] are also
isolated for comparison (Supplementary Table 1). The labeled
ORTEP diagrams of the TPP and TTP derivatives are given in
Fig. 1 and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6. Quantitative information
that shows the displacements of each atom from the 24-atom
mean plane and the orientations of the axial ligands are available
in Supplementary Fig. 7. “Shoestring” diagrams illustrating the
core conformation and cobalt displacement from the N4 mean
plane are given in Supplementary Fig. 8. It is seen that [Co(TPP)
(2-MeHIm)] shows the most distorted porphyrin core with
saddled conformation among the four new structures, which can
be attributed to the strong steric repulsion between imidazole
and Np–Co–NIm planes evidenced by the smallest φ angle
(8.5°) between them (Supplementary Fig. 7). The key structural
parameters
of
all
known
imidazole(ate)
ligated
cobalt(II)
porphyrinates are given in Table 1. Also given are the parameters
of three pairs of 2-methylimidazole(ate) ligated iron(II) analogs.
It is seen all the cobalt(II) complexes with neutral imidazole
ligands including the two new structures have (Co–Np)av

distances ≤2.0 Å, which is consistent with the low-spin Co(II)
and small metal out of plane displacements (Δ24 and Δ4 ≤0.26 Å).
This is contrasted to the two imidazolate derivatives that show
longer (Co–Np)av distances (≥2.0 Å) and unusually large metal
out of plane displacements (≥0.43 Å), which are characteristic
features of high-spin complexes11. Moreover, the two imidazolate
ligands show shorter axial bonds (≤2.1 Å) than the imidazole
(≥2.1 Å), indicating stronger axial bonding. Interestingly, similar
patterns are also seen in the structures of iron(II) analogs that
the imidazolate ligands always induce longer (M–Np)av, larger
metal out of plane displacements and shorter axial bonds
(Table 1)15,20,22–30. In the study of imidazole(ate) ligated iron
(II) porphyrinates, Scheidt and coworkers15 have assigned two
high-spin
ground
states

and
ðdxz; dyzÞ3ðdxyÞ1ðdz2Þ1ðdx2y2Þ1
for
2-MeIm−
and
2-MeHIm
derivatives, respectively. The authors suggested that the different
electronic conﬁgurations caused the varying degree of electro-
static repulsion between the in-plane orbital of iron(II) and the
negative charge of pyrrole nitrogen, which results in different
structural features, including the iron displacements15.
Electron paramagnetic resonance. The dramatically different
structural parameters between imidazole and imidazolate species
indicate different spin states of the Co(II) centers. To conﬁrm
this, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments have
been conducted on the four new complexes. The experimental
and simulated spectra of crystalline [Co(TPP)(2-MeHIm)] and
[Co(TPP)(2-MeIm−)]−are given in Fig. 2. Multitemperature
measurements on crystalline samples, solution samples with dif-
ferent equivalents of ligands, as well as those of TTP derivatives
are available in Supplementary Figs. 9–16. As can be seen, the two
imidazole derivatives ([Co(TPP)(2-MeHIm)] and [Co(TTP)(2-
MeHIm)]) show consistent axial symmetric spectra with g⊥= 2.3,
g// = 2.0 (A//Co = 79.2 G), which are typical for a ﬁve-coordinate
low-spin Co(II)31–35, in accordance with the single crystal
structural features (e.g., small metal displacements and shorter
(Co–Np)av distances). In contrast, the two imidazolate derivatives
([Co(TPP)(2-MeIm−)]−
and
[Co(TTP)(2-MeIm−)]−)
show
characteristic resonances at 6.0, 4.0, and 2.0 (A//Co = 82.0 G) and
5.4, 3.9, 2.0, respectively, (Supplementary Figs. 15b and 16b),
which corresponds to a high-spin Co(II) (S = 3/2)36–38, in
agreement with the dramatically different structural parameters
from the low-spin counterparts. The zero value of E/D yielded by
simulations conﬁrmed the axial system where the | ± 3/2 > Kra-
mers doublet is the excited state and resonances at 4.0 (3.9) and
2.0 come from the ground | ± 1/2 > doublet39. Notably, signals at
~2.3, which appear weak in solid while strong in solution sam-
ples, are observed in the spectra of imidazolate derivatives (the
asterisk in Fig. 2b, Supplementary Figs. 9, 10, 13, and 14). To
understand this, reactions of [Co(TPP)] (or [Co(TTP)]) with
different equivalents of [K(222)(2-MeIm−)] in PhCl (or THF)
were monitored and the spectra are given in Supplementary Fig.
13 (Supplementary Fig. 14). It is seen when 1 eq. of 2-MeIm−was
added to the [Co(TPP)] solution, resonances belonging to HS
species (4.9–5.5 and 3.6–3.8) and a strong signal at ~2.3 became
available immediately. Further addition of 2-MeIm−(3, 5, and 7
eq.) has led to the increase of HS resonances, which suggests
isolable [Co(TPP)(2-MeIm−)]−product was generated gradually.
In contrast, the signal at ~2.3, though decreasing relatively, was
apparent even at the saturated solution (7 eq.). Hence, an inter-
mediate of [Co(TPP)∙∙∙∙(2-MeIm−)]−with weakly bonding axial
ligand, which is generated once 2-MeIm−is added, is proposed to
exist in the solution. Such a weak Co∙∙∙∙(2-MeIm−) interaction

does not draw the metal out of porphyrin plane as much as the
axial bond of isolable [Co(TPP)(2-MeIm−)]−crystal; it is how-
ever similar to the longer axial bond of [Co(TPP)(2-MeHIm)],
which shows low-spin signal at ~2.3 (vide infra). The inter-
mediate also explains the weak signals observed in the crystalline
samples since it can accompany the isolated crystals through the
mother liquor as reported in other cases40, and/or be generated
during grinding processes (Supplementary Fig. 9).
Magnetic susceptibility. Additional evidence for the spin state
determination of the four complexes comes from temperature
dependent (2$30 K) magnetic susceptibility measurements,
which are given in Fig. 3. As can be seen, the product of the
molar susceptibility (χM) and temperature (T) of the two imi-
dazolate complexes are 2.03 and 1.93 cm3 K/mol, close to that
expected for the HS state (1.88 cm3 K/mol). This is contrasted
to the two imidazole derivatives, which show χMT at 0.49 and
0.54 cm3 K/mol, close to that expected for the LS state (0.38 cm3
K/mol). Hence, the magnetic susceptibility measurements are
well consistent with the EPR results, both of which conﬁrm
the high- and low-spin states for imidazolate and imidazole
derivatives, respectively.
X-ray absorption spectroscopy. X-ray absorption spectroscopy
(XAS) studies have been conducted on [Co(TPP)(2-MeHIm)]
and [Co(TPP)(2-MeIm−)]−to give more insights into the elec-
tronic structures. The pre-edge features of Co K-edge X-ray
absorption near edge structure (XANES), which originates from
the 1s →3d states hybridized with p states of ligands (e.g.,
nitrogen) are given in Fig. 4a, b (black traces)41. Both species
show identical pre-edge transition and the ﬁrst inﬂection points
at 7708.8 and 7719.3 eV (Supplementary Fig. 17), which are in
accordance with the reported values for Co(II) complexes42. A
shoulder feature along the rising edge at 7714.3 eV, which cor-
responds to the 1s to 4p + LMCT shakedown transition is
observed for [Co(TPP)(2-MeHIm)]43,44. Full multiple scattering
theory (FMST) simulations are performed to interpret the
XANES and given in Fig. 4a, b (red traces). The less sharp pre-
edge of experimental spectra is due to the convoluted resolu-
tion45. The projection, integration (from −4 to 2 eV) and full
width at half maximum (FWHM) of the unoccupied states of t2g
and eg orbitals, which have been calibrated from the experimental
data are given in Supplementary Figs. 18 and 19 and Supple-
mentary Table 246,47. Also given are the ratio of two unoccupied
states of t2g and eg, which are calculated to be ~1.8 and ~1.4 for
[Co(TPP)(2-MeIm−)]−and [Co(TPP)(2-MeHIm)], respectively.
Since the HS state are expected to have more unoccupied t2g but
less unoccupied eg to give a larger ratio value (Fig. 5), the XANES
is parallel to the EPR, magnetic susceptibility, and single crystal
characterizations, which suggest HS for the imidazolate deriva-
tives. Fitting of EXAFS (Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Struc-
ture) spectra can be used to obtain geometric parameters of the
ﬁrst shell coordination around the Cobalt atom. The ﬁtted EXAFS
oscillations and the Fourier transforms are available in Fig. 4c, d.
The ﬁtting results are consistent with the crystal structures and
given in Supplementary Table 3 for compariosn. Time-dependent
density functional theory (TDDFT) simulations are also per-
formed to interpret the XANES, which however underestimates
the deep empty states as can be seen in Supplementary Figs. 20
and 21.
Discussion
As has been seen, the removal of N−H proton of 2-MeHIm has
led to dramatic changes in both geometric and electronic struc-
tures of Co(II) porphyrinates. The changes appear unexpected
because the imidazolate has been accepted as a strong ligand,
which would induce LS species, e.g., in the alkaline transition5–7.
Thus, we have conducted DFT calculations to investigate the
products’ electronic conﬁgurations (Supplementary Figs. 22–25
and Supplementary Data 1). M06/6-31G(d)/TZVP level of theory
has predicted 2.6 and 5.7 kcal/mol more stable LS [Co(TPP)
(2-MeHIm)] and HS [Co(TPP)(2-MeIm−)]−, respectively, in
agreement with the experimental results. Qualitative diagrams
showing the d-orbital energy ordering are illustrated in Fig. 5. The
MOs of low and high-spin [Co(TPP)(2-MeIm−)]−are compared
in Fig. 5b. The dramatically lowered dxz; dyz; dz2 and dx2y2
orbitals of HS state, which is consistent with the short axial bond
distance and large metal displacement are obvious (Table 1).
Close examinations also found the anti-bonding interaction
between the imidazolate π orbital and the β orbital of dyz in LS
state, which is 0.364 eV higher in energy than the α orbital of
dx2y2 in HS state (gray arrow). These electronic features are in
agreement with the experimentally observed HS state of [Co
(TPP)(2-MeIm−)]−. The electronic structures of LS [Co(TPP)(2-
MeHIm)] are given in Fig. 5a. The higher dx2y2 and the larger
energy differences between dx2y2 and dxz/dyz are seen, which is
consistent with the small metal displacements of LS cobalt(II)
(0.17 and 0.26 Å). Moreover, the near-degenerate dxz and dyz

Co(II), is in favor of stronger σ donation of imidazole(ate)
through dz2, which would draw the metal more out of the por-
phyrin plane, lower the dx2y2 orbital and make the HS states
accessible. It is important to note that the steric hindrance is not
required here because ﬁve-coordinate iron(II) porphyrinates with
non-hindered imidazole (e.g., 1-MeIm) were also reported to be
HS, which suggests the large iron displacement is induced mainly
by strong axial bonding48,49. Interestingly, the switchable spin
states of Co(II) analogs suggest 3d7 Co(II), which always has one
electron on dz2, has weaker tendency to the σ donation of axial
ligand than 3d6 iron(II). For the imidazole ligand, the relatively

weak axial bonding only induced small metal displacements
(e.g., Δ4: 0.12–0.17 of [Co(Porph)(Im)] (Porph = Porphyrin) vs.
0.32–0.35 of [Fe(Porph)(2-MeHIm)] and 0.52–0.56 Å of [Fe
(Porph)(2-MeIm−)]−, Table 1), so that the dx2y2 orbital is not
drawn lower enough for the access of HS. This is true for both
hindered and non-hindered imidazole as seen in Table 1, con-
sistent with the LS states of all known ﬁve-coordinate [Co(Porph)
(Im)] complexes. In contrast, the 2-methylimidazolate, a stronger
ligand, has induced much shorter axial bonds and dramatically
displaced Co(II), which drew the dx2y2 lower enough and made
the

be
accessible.
Strategies to obtain a high-spin cobalt(II) heme complex have
been proposed for many years. As early as 1983, Scheidt and
Gouterman50 predicted this to be achieved in ﬁve coordination
with the metal out of plane, as this lowers the dx2y2 energy
(egðdπÞ ! b1gðdx2y2Þ). Later, DiMagno and coworkers51 repor-
ted
extremely
electron-deﬁcient
β-octaﬂuoro-meso-tetra-
arylporphyrins F28TPP, which reduced porphyrin ligand ﬁeld
and stabilized dx2y2 orbital. Nevertheless, a HS product in solid
state has never been isolated and characterized.
In summary, comprehensive spectroscopic characterizations
on four isolated cobalt(II) heme complexes demonstrate the
removal of N−H proton of axial 2-MeHIm has changed the metal
centers from LS to HS, thus mimicking spin state transition of
heme systems. The single crystal data highly promote stereo-
electronic studies on the mechanisms of spin state transition,
which reveal different response of iron(II) and cobalt(II) to the
axial imidazole(ate) ligands and underline the stronger ligand
ﬁeld of imidazolate. The work also provides quantitative values
for the metal displacements of hemes (e.g., Δ24 and Δ4 ≥0.2 Å,
Table 1), which usually accompany with spin state transitions
(and/or
d-orbital
reconstructions)
that
are
physiologically
important and can be triggered by charge changes of proximal
ligands. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst examples of
synthetic metalloporphyrins that can switch spin states through
one proton of proximal ligands.
Methods
General procedure. All reactions and manipulations were carried out under argon
using a double-manifold vacuum line, Schlenkware, and cannula techniques unless
otherwise noted. Tetrahydrofuran, chlorobenzene, and hexanes were dried and
degassed by standard techniques. General considerations on the measurements
and experiments, as well as some experimental details are described in the
Supplementary Information.
X-ray structure determinations. Single crystal experiments were carried out
on a BRUKER D8 QUEST system with graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation
(λ = 0.71073 Å). The crystal samples were placed in inert oil, mounted on a glass
ﬁber attached to a brass mounting pin, and transferred to the cold dinitrogen gas
steam (100 K). Crystal data were collected and integrated using a Bruker Apex II
system. The structures were solved by direct method (SHELXS-2014) and reﬁned
against F2 using SHELXL-201452.
EPR measurements and simulations. EPR were carried out on a Bruker EMX
plus 10/12 CW X-band EPR spectrometer, equipped with High-Q cylindrical cavity
and Oxford ESR910 continuous ﬂow liquid helium cryostat. The EPR spectra were
simulated with the EasySpin package53, which is operated in MATLAB. Typically,
~5 mg of crystal sample was transferred into an EPR tube in a dry-box. After the
sample was grinded into crystalline powder by a quartz pestle, the tube was sealed
for measurements. A solution with a concentration of 2.98 × 10−3 mmol/mL is
used for measurements.
Magnetometry. Variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements were
performed on Quantum Design SQUID-MPMS3 (1–1000 Hz) magnetometer.
The experimental susceptibilities were corrected for the diamagnetism of the
constituent atoms (Pascal’s tables) and background of the sample holder.

The X-ray absorption ﬁne structure spectroscopy. Experimental data were
recorded at beamline 20 BM of Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National
Laboratory, using the Si (111) double crystal monochromator to scan the energy.
The spectra were collected in transmission mode and energy calibration were done
using Co foil as references. Data analysis was performed at 1W1B and 1W2B,
Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility.
Electronic structure. The G09 program package54 was used to optimize
the structures and for frequency analysis. The model complex for [Co(TPP)
(2-MeIm−)]−and [Co(TPP)(2-MeHIm)] were fully optimized without any
constraints by using the Hybrid-GGA functional U-M0655 and U-B3LYP56,57.
