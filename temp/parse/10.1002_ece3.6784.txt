Abstract
Frogs and toads (Lissamphibia: Anura) show a diversity of locomotor modes that 
allow them to inhabit a wide range of habitats. The different locomotor modes are 
likely to be linked to anatomical specializations of the skeleton within the typical frog 
Bauplan. While such anatomical adaptations of the hind limbs and the pelvic girdle 
are comparably well understood, the pectoral girdle received much less attention in 
the past. We tested for locomotor-mode-related shape differences in the pectoral 
girdle bones of 64 anuran species by means of micro-computed-tomography-based 
geometric morphometrics. The pectoral girdles of selected species were analyzed 
with regard to the effects of shape differences on muscle moment arms across the 
shoulder joint and stress dissipation within the coracoid. Phylogenetic relationships, 
size, and locomotor behavior have an effect on the shape of the pectoral girdle in 
anurans, but there are differences in the relative impact of these factors between 
the bones of this skeletal unit. Remarkable shape diversity has been observed within 
locomotor groups indicating many-to-one mapping of form onto function. Significant 
shape differences have mainly been related to the overall pectoral girdle geometry 
and the shape of the coracoid. Most prominent shape differences have been found 
between burrowing and nonburrowing species with headfirst and backward burrow-
ing species significantly differing from one another and from the other locomotor 
groups. The pectoral girdle shapes of burrowing species have generally larger mo-
ment arms for (simulated) humerus retractor muscles across the shoulder joint, which 
might be an adaptation to the burrowing behavior. The mechanisms of how the mo-
ment arms were enlarged differed between species and were associated with differ-
ences in the reaction of the coracoid to simulated loading by physiologically relevant 
forces.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Frogs and toads (Lissamphibia: Anura) inhabit a wide range of habitats 
and, among other things, utilize different locomotor behaviors within 
those habitats (Wells, 2007). Almost all anurans are capable of some 
kind of hopping or jumping (Wells, 2007) and swimming (Abourachid 
& Green, 1999). Some species have been reported to extensively use 
quadrupedal walking (e.g., Ahn, Furrow, & Biewener, 2004); other, 
in particular, fossorial species show burrowing behavior by moving 
the substrate using either their hind legs, forelegs, or heads (e.g., 
Emerson, 1976; Nomura, Rossa-Feres, & Langeani, 2009). Arboreal 
species are able to climb in vegetation (Herrel et al., 2013); some of 
them have evolved parachuting or gliding abilities (Oliver, 1951).
From an ecomorphological point of view, different behaviors 
and the associated performances provide the link between the mor-
phology of a specimen and its ecology (e.g., Arnold, 1983; Ricklefs 
& Miles,  1994; Wainwright,  1994). The anatomy determines the 
functional properties, which in turn determine the performance ca-
pacities of a specimen (Wainwright, 2007). In this context, natural 
selection should favor anatomical peculiarities that allow high loco-
motor performances, as moving in space is crucial for individuals, for 
example, to use the resources of their habitat, to encounter mates, 
or to escape from predators (e.g., Liedvogel, Chapman, Muheim, & 
Åkesson, 2013; Nathan et al., 2008).
Previous studies (e.g., Citadini, Brandt, Williams, & Gomes, 2018; 
Emerson, 1988; Vera, Ferretti, Abdala, & Cointry, 2020; Zug, 1978) 
have reported associations of anatomical traits with locomotor be-
havior or performance, or ecology within the Anura. Most of these 
studies have focused on the pelvic girdle, the relative length of fore- 
or hind limbs, or the anatomy of the hind limbs. For example, the 
takeoff speed for jumping was found to be associated with hind limb 
length, hind limb muscle mass, and muscle contraction rates (Choi 
& Park, 1996; Choi, Shim, & Ricklefs, 2003) and specific locomotor 
modes tended to be associated with differences in the shape of the 
sacrum (Jorgensen & Reilly, 2013). The mechanical properties of the 
femur and tibiofibula differed between certain locomotor modes 
(Vera et al., 2020; Wilson, Espinoza, Shah, & Blob, 2009). Species in-
habiting the same microhabitat were similar with regard to their hind 
limb morphology, external body proportions, and performance in 
selected ecologically relevant tasks (Moen, Irschick, & Wiens, 2013).
High jumping performance, for instance, was generally associ-
ated with relatively short forelimbs (Zug,  1972), comparably long 
hind limbs (e.g., Astley, 2016; Emerson, 1978) with tibiofibulae being 
longer than the femora (Gómez & Lires, 2019), larger hind limb mus-
cles (e.g., Astley, 2016), and specific physiological muscle properties 
(e.g., Astley,  2016; Chadwell, Hartwell, & Peters,  2002). The dif-
ference in the length of the hind limbs compared to the forelimbs 
was less pronounced in primary walking species (Reynaga, Astley, 
& Azizi, 2018). Jumping and walking, hopping species have been re-
ported to differ in the anatomy of the ilio-sacral joint and the associ-
ated configuration of the ilio-lumbaris muscle, although there were 
some exceptions in the correlation of joint anatomy with locomotor 
mode (Emerson, 1979).
In addition, previously recognized morphological adaptations 
to swimming involved specific relative limb proportions (Gómez & 
Lires, 2019) and extensive foot webbing (Laurent, 1964). Additionally, 
the relative muscle mass of the hind limbs in frequently swimming 
species was higher if compared to other species (Moen, 2019). The 
ilio-sacral joint in the aquatic species Xenupus laevis allowed for slid-
ing and was thought to thereby increase the length of the power 
stroke and to contribute to fast submerging after breathing (Videler 
& Jorna, 1985).
Climbing behavior was usually associated with a bicondylar 
sacro-urostylic articulation (Reilly & Jorgensen,  2011), large fin-
ger and toe tips (Moen et al., 2013), adhesive toe pads (Emerson & 
Diehl, 1980; Noble & Jaeckle, 1928), and modifications of the finger 
extensor muscles (Burton, 1998). In addition, hands and feet could 
be webbed (Laurent, 1964), the distal forelimbs of certain species 
might be adapted to grasping (Manzano, Abdala, & Herrel, 2008), 
and the presence of an intercalary cartilage or bone between 
the two terminal phalanges in some arboreal anuran species was 
thought to increase the efficiency of the adhesive toe pads (Noble 
& Jaeckle, 1928).
Finally, the body of burrowing species was generally observed to 
be globular (Dutta & Pradhan, 1985; Laurent, 1964) with relatively 
shorter and stronger limbs (Laurent, 1964; Moen, 2019) and a short 
tibiofibula relative to the femur (Enriquez-Urzelai, Montori, Llorente, 
& Kaliontzopoulou,  2015; Gómez & Lires,  2019). Most backward 
burrowing species had enlarged metatarsal tubercles (Kley & 
Kearney, 2006; Moen et al., 2013). Short hind limbs and the presence 
of metatarsal tubercles have been suggested to increase the per-
formance of backward burrowing (Emerson,  1976). Further exam-
ples of the adaptation to backward burrowing include the increase 
in the size and robustness of the prehallux (Kley & Kearney, 2006) 
and species-specific modification of the feet muscles (Blotto, 
Pereyra, Faivovich, Dias, & Grant, 2017; Burton, 2001; Sanders & 
Davies,  1983). Headfirst burrowing has been reported to be spe-
cies-specifically associated with a modified skull (Davies,  1984; 
Menzies & Tyler, 1977), massive mandibles (Menzies & Tyler, 1977), 
relatively short and robust forelimbs (Brown, Jackson, & Brown, 
1972), or modifications of the manus (Kley & Kearney, 2006).
The forelimbs of anurans have been reported to accomplish 
species- and case-specific tasks during locomotion (e.g., hopping/
jumping: Nauwelaerts & Aerts,  2006; swimming: Abourachid & 
Green, 1999; Gillis & Biewener, 2000; walking: Reynaga et al., 2018; 
burrowing: Sanders & Davies, 1983; climbing: Manzano et al., 2008). 
The forelimbs, for example, decelerate the body during coordinated 
landing (Cox & Gillis, 2015), move the soil during headfirst burrow-
ing (Emerson, 1976), or stabilize the body during gliding (Emerson & 
Koehl, 1990). In addition, some muscles originating from the pec-
toral girdle and inserting onto the forelimb have been shown to be 
active during different phases of a jump (Akella & Gillis, 2011). Yet, 
the pectoral girdle, that is, the central element linking the forelimbs 
to the axial skeleton, has received little attention regarding the as-
sociation of anatomical traits with and the functional adaptation to 
different locomotor behaviors.

ENGELKES et al.
Different pectoral girdle types (arciferal, firmisternal) were sug-
gested to accomplish similar tasks (i.e., dissipating landing forces), 
but in different ways (Emerson,  1983, 1984). One previous study 
reported that higher jumping abilities were associated with shorter 
scapulae (Zug, 1972), whereas another observed jumping species to 
have long scapulae with broad proximal and distal ends, and long 
claviculae and coracoids (Soliz, Tulli, & Abdala,  2017). Headfirst 
burrowing was associated with a forward shifted scapula causing 
the suprascapula to overlap the posterior margin of the skull, and 
robust and posteromedially directed coracoids in some species 
(Davies, 1984; Emerson, 1976). Besides these partly contradictory 
reports, little is known about the anuran pectoral girdle in relation to 
different locomotor behaviors and on the biomechanical functions 
of this skeletal complex during locomotion.
Here, we aim to resolve the relationships between locomotor 
mode, shape variation, and biomechanical function of the pectoral 
girdle of anurans. To do so, selected anuran species were assigned 
to one of six groups of locomotor behavior (subsequently called lo-
comotor groups) and the shape of their pectoral girdle bones was 
assessed by means of geometric morphometrics. The phylogenetic 
signal was determined, and shape differences among locomotor 
groups were statistically assessed. The pectoral girdles of selected 
species were analyzed with regard to the effects of shape differ-
ences on muscle moment arms across the shoulder joint and simu-
lated stress dissipation within the coracoid. Results were discussed 
in the context of adaptation to locomotor behaviors.
2 | MATERIAL AND METHODS
2.1 | Specimens and µCT scanning
Locomotor groups were defined (Table 1) and assigned based on lit-
erature accounts (Appendix S1: Tables A1, A2). Sixty-four species 
(Figure 1) covering 31 of the 52 currently recognized (Frost, 2020) 
anuran (Amphibia: Anura) families were selected based on their 
phylogenetic position and locomotor behavior. A time-calibrated 
phylogeny was extracted from TimeTree.org (accessed 2nd March 
2020; Kumar, Stecher, Suleski, & Hedges,  2017); six species were 
replaced by close relatives (assessed from Pyron & Wiens, 2011) for 
extraction as they were not listed on TimeTree.org. Species names 
were updated following Frost (2020). The aim was to achieve het-
erogeneous subclades with regard to locomotor behavior and a wide 
dispersion of locomotor groups across the phylogeny in order to 
avoid potential negative effects on the statistical analyses (Adams 
& Collyer, 2018).
Selected micro-computed tomography (µCT) scans of a pre-
vious study (Engelkes et al., 2019) were used in combination with 
additional µCT volumes. Scans were performed with a Skyscan 
1172 (Bruker microCT), Phoenix Nanotom S or M (GE Sensing & 
Inspection Technologies GmbH), Phoenix v|tome|x L 450 (GE Sensing 
& Inspection Technologies GmbH), or a YXLON FF20 CT or FF35 
CT (YXLON International GmbH; Appendix S1: Table A1). Additional 
µCT volumes were downloaded from MorphoSource (https://www.
morph​osour​ce.org/; Appendix S1: Table A2).
2.2 | Segmentation and surface generation
A previous study (Engelkes et al., 2019) found that the techniques 
applied to generate the polygon surfaces have a significant effect 
on the landmark data acquired from them. The workflow herein fol-
lowed the recommendations in Engelkes (in review) in order to obtain 
surfaces that are as accurate as possible. The pectoral girdle bones 
(including calcified sternal or episternal elements, if applicable) were 
roughly segmented in Amira (version 6.0.1; Konrad-Zuse-Zentrum 
Berlin, FEI Visualization Sciences Group), and the mean gray value m 
of pectoral girdle bones and surrounding soft tissues, and the stand-
ard deviation of the soft tissue gray values were determined for each 
original CT volume separately. The mean gray value m was used to 
set limits to the gray value histogram of the respective CT volume 
in Fiji (based on ImageJ 1.51n; Schindelin et  al.,  2012; Schneider, 
Rasband, & Eliceiri, 2012). The limits were chosen such that they laid 
symmetrically around the value calculated by 1.019 × m − 462.812

(see Engelkes, in review for the derivation of this formula) and such 
that the contrast of bone and surrounding voxels was maximized 
without bone voxels getting black.
Each adjusted CT volume was resliced from top to bottom 
and from left to right, and all stacks were thresholded by auto-
matic local thresholding (Fiji plugin Auto Local Threshold, Landini, 
Rueden, Schindelin, Hiner, & Helfrich, https://imagej.net/Auto_
Local_Thres​hold). The three thresholding results of each CT vol-
ume were combined in Amira by setting those voxels as bone that 
were classified as bone in any two of the three thresholded stacks. 
The resulting stack was combined with the rough segmentation of 
the pectoral girdle bones to separate the bones form other struc-
tures. Foramina were filled and artifacts (i.e., segmented noise, 
unsegmented bone voxels) were corrected in regions in which 
semilandmarks should be placed by manually adjusting the seg-
mentation accordingly.
Polygon surfaces were generated using the Generate Lego Surface 
module in Amira in combination with surface simplification (reduc-
tion of polygon count and smoothing; Simplification Editor and Smooth 
Surface module) to a subjective optimal degree. Surface generation 
and simplification were accelerated by a modified version of the 
MultiExport macro (Engelkes, Friedrich, Hammel, & Haas, 2018). The 
bones of the right pectoral girdle halves were mirrored (MeshLab 
version 1.3.3; Cignoni et al., 2008) to the left to avoid any potential 
bias due to orientation during landmark acquisition. Surfaces with 
major deformations or artifacts were excluded from subsequent 
steps.
2.3 | Landmarks and superimposition
Landmarks were, with slight modifications, adopted from Engelkes 
et al. (2019) and complemented by curves of sliding semilandmarks 
(Gunz & Mitteroecker, 2013; Figure 2; Appendix S1: Table A3). For 
each pectoral girdle half, 19 fixed landmarks (including start and 
end points of curves) and nine curves with 21 to 29 semilandmarks 
were acquired in Stratovan Checkpoint (version 2020.02.05.1043; 
Stratovan Corporation). No landmarks were acquired from the 
sternum or episternum, as those structures were present in only 
some species. Three microhylid species (Kaloula pulchra, Microhyla 
nepenthicola, and M. pulchra) lacked a clavicula and, consequently, 
the (semi)landmarks on the clavicula were missing in the respective 
landmark configurations.
All subsequent steps were performed in R (version 3.5.3; R Core 
Team,  2019) using RStudio (version 1.1.463; RStudio Team,  2018) 
and functions of the packages abind (version 1.4-5; Plate & 
Heiberger,  2016), ape (version 5.3; Paradis & Schliep,  2018), geo-

ENGELKES et al.
2.5-4; Oksanen et al., 2019). The landmark sets were imported into 
R, and the missing (semi)landmarks were estimated (estimate.missing) 
to allow for the incomplete landmark sets being analyzed together 
with the others. The following five subsets of (semi)landmarks were 
defined: all fixed landmarks (including start and endpoints of curves) 
to analyze the overall geometry of the pectoral girdle, and all land-
marks and semilandmarks of a given pectoral girdle bone to allow for 
a more detailed shape comparison. Species lacking a clavicula were 
excluded from the subset consisting of (semi)landmarks on the cla-
vicula. The following steps were performed for the full landmark sets 
and for each subset separately. All landmark sets of a given species 
were superimposed using a Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA; 
gpagen, if applicable, including sliding of semilandmarks to minimize 
bending energy), rescaled to their original centroid size and the spe-
cies mean shape was calculated (mshape). A GPA (including sliding of 
semilandmarks to minimize bending energy, if applicable) was per-
formed to superimpose the species mean shapes. The resulting sets 
of superimposed species mean shapes will subsequently be referred 
to as full landmark dataset and landmark datasets i through v, with 
the full dataset consisting of all landmarks and semilandmarks, land-
mark datasets i denoting the set of fixed landmarks and ii-v denoting 
the sets comprising all landmarks and semilandmarks, respectively, 
on the scapula, coracoid, cleithrum, or clavicula.
2.4 | Statistical analyses and visualization
The full landmark dataset was used to assess the modularity (sensu 
Schlosser, 2002) within the pectoral girdle in a phylogenetic context 
by calculating the covariance ratio (phylo.modularity; Adams, 2016); 
modules are constituted by highly correlated subsets of traits (here 
landmark coordinates), whereas the covariation between such mod-
ules is relatively weak. The statistical significance was assessed by 
1,000 permutations.

ENGELKES et al.
The following analyses were performed for each set of super-
imposed species mean shapes (landmark datasets i–v) separately. 
The phylogenetic signal in the landmark data was assessed using 
a multivariate version of the K-statistic with the statistical signifi-
cance being determined by 1,000 random permutations (physignal; 
Adams, 2014). As there was a statistically significant phylogenetic 
signal in all landmark datasets, separate phylogenetic MANOVAs 
(pMANOVAs; using residual randomization and type-II sums of 
squares; procD.pgls) were performed to test for significant differ-
ences between the mean shapes of locomotor groups. Potential ef-
fects of specimen size on shape were accounted for by incorporating 
the log-transformed centroid size and its interaction with mode of 
locomotion in the pMANOVAs. If there were statistically significant 
differences, pairwise comparisons of the mean shape between lo-
comotor groups were performed while accounting for size (pairwise; 
null model: coords ~ logCS, where coords denotes one of landmark 
datasets i–v and logCS the log-transformed centroid size). Statistical 
significance was assessed by 1,000 permutations in pMANOVAs 
and pairwise comparisons; p-values below .05 were considered sig-
nificant in all tests.
Principal component analyses (PCAs; gm.prcomp) were sepa-
rately performed for landmark datasets i–v to visualize the distribu-
tion of species mean shapes in morphospace (plot, shapeHulls). For 
the dataset of fixed landmarks only (i), all individual landmark con-
figurations belonging to a given species were transformed as their 
respective mean shape had been transformed during GPA and PCA 
(details in Engelkes et al., 2019); the transformed landmark configu-
rations were plotted along with their means. The number of signif-
icant principal components was determined using the broken-stick 
model (Macarthur,  1957; evplot function published with Borcard, 
Gillet, & Legendre,  2011). Surfaces and landmark configurations 
were rendered in MODO (version 10.1v2; The Foundry).
2.5 | Muscle moment arms
Musculoskeletal models were created for representative specimens 
of selected species (Figures 3 and 4) that appeared interesting based 
on their position in the morphospaces of the overall pectoral girdle 
shape (landmark dataset i) and of the coracoid shape (landmark data-
set iii). The shape analyses suggested that most locomotor-mode-
related shape differences occurred in the ventral part of the pectoral 
girdle. Therefore, the effects of the shape of the ventral pectoral 
girdle part (i.e., clavicula and coracoid) on the moment arms of mus-
cles across the shoulder joint were assessed. Models were created 
in OpenSim (version 3.3; Delp et al., 2007) using simplified (inner 
structures removed, all holes in the surface closed, polygon count 
reduction and smoothing) surfaces of the respective specimens.
Both (left and right) landmark configurations of a given specimen 
were combined to one configuration. This configuration was used to 
transform the corresponding surfaces of the left-side pectoral girdle 
bones and, if applicable, the bony part of the sternum or episternum 
to a common size and comparable orientation (R, MeshLab, MODO). 
The origin of the coordinate system was located in the shoulder 
joint cavity, the y-z-plane was parallel to the sagittal plane with the 
z-axis being approximately parallel to the long axis of the specimen, 
and the line connecting the anteromedial tip of the clavicula to the 
posteromedial tip of the coracoid was parallel to the x-z-plane. All 
commonly scaled and orientated surfaces were equipped with the 
same simplified humerus in order to exclude any potential effects 
of the humerus shape on muscle moment arms. The shoulder joint 
was defined with two axes of rotation: one allowing adduction and 
abduction, and one allowing protraction and retraction. The hu-
merus being aligned with the x-axis (perpendicular to the sagittal [y-
z] plane) was used as reference position for angular measurements.
Previous studies (e.g., Bigalke, 1927; Gaupp, 1896; Ritland, 1955) 
showed that different muscles originated along the midline of the 
ventral side of the pectoral girdle and inserted onto the humerus. 
Those muscles were reduced to three hypothetical muscles that 
were included in each model (Figure 4a): one muscle (“anterior”) orig-
inating from the anteromedial tip of the clavicula, one (“perpendic-
ular”) being perpendicular to the long axis of the specimen, and one 
(“posterior”) originating from the posteromedial tip of the coracoid. 
If an episternum or sternum was present and contained a pars ossea 
(senus Gaupp, 1896), additional muscles (“episternal,” “sternal,” re-
spectively) originating from, respectively, the anterior or posterior 
tip of the bone were included, too. All muscles were defined to insert 
in a common point at the humerus. Warping objects were configured 
as needed to prevent muscle pathways from intersecting with skel-
etal elements; the potential effects of soft tissues in shaping muscle 
pathways were neglected. The moment arms of the perpendicular 
muscle was assessed with regard to adduction and abduction, the 
moment arms of all other muscles were determined with regard to 
protraction and retraction (Figure 4b, c).
2.6 | Finite element analysis of coracoids
The species close to the extreme ends of the first two principal com-
ponents and a species close to the mean shape in the landmark data-
set of species mean coracoid shapes (iii) were chosen to assess the 
effects of different loading conditions by using finite element analy-
ses. The coracoid surfaces were extracted from the corresponding 
surfaces used for musculoskeletal modeling. As a consequence of 
this approach, all coracoids were scaled and orientated in a way that 
reflected the actual conditions in the specimens and they were mod-
eled as solid structures. Neglecting inner structures was expected 
to have a minor effect base on the observations of Mielke and 
Nyakatura (2019). The coracoid in Hemisus marmoratus was fused to 
other bones; those bones were manually removed (MODO).
Tetrahedral meshes were generated and the models were set up 
in FEBio Studio (version 1.0.0; Maas, Ellis, Ateshian, & Weiss, 2012). 
Bone was modeled as an isotropic elastic material with a Young's 
modulus of 10 GPa and a Poisson's ratio of 0.35 as these values lay 
within the previously reported ranges for vertebrate bones (e.g., 
Currey,  1984; Hudson, Bennett, & Franklin,  2004). Five different

loading scenarios were deduced from supposed functions of the 
coracoid (Table 2; Figure 5a). The applied loads were scaled by the 
area on which they were applied such that equal forces were ap-
plied across all loading scenarios and specimens. Von Mises stresses 
were visualized in PostView (version 2.5.0; also part of FEBio suite), 
and the mesh-weighted arithmetic mean von Mises stresses (mwam; 
Marcé-Nogué, Esteban-Trivigno, Escrig, & Gil, 2016) were calculated 
in R.
3 | RESULTS
3.1 | Overall shape of pectoral girdle bones
The first five principal components (PCs) of the species mean shapes 
of the overall geometry of the pectoral girdle bones (landmark 
dataset i) were significant and, respectively, represented 48.62%, 
14.42%, 8.5%, 5.62%, and 5.1% of the variance in the landmark data.
The pectoral girdle shapes of swimming and climbing species, 
and those of swimming and backward burrowing species differed 
with regard to the shape differences associated with PC 1 (Figure 6) 
and, in the latter case, also PC 4. In addition, there was a tendency 
for shape differences between backward and headfirst burrowing 
species along PCs 1 and 4, between burrowing and nonburrowing 
species along PC 2, and between backward burrowing and climb-
ing species along PC 4. Yet, all locomotor groups comprised pectoral 
girdle shapes that were similar to some of those observed in other 
groups (i.e., all locomotor groups showed some regions of overlap 
along PCs 1–5 in pairwise comparisons) and the species represented 
by more than one specimen showed some shape similarities (overlap 
in PC plot) with other species.
The first principal component was mainly associated with differ-
ences in the height (dorsal–ventral expansion) of the scapula relative 
to its width (anterior–posterior expansion) and to the length of the 
clavicula and coracoid, the position of the glenoid cavity relative to 
the dorsal margin of the scapula and the ventral midline, as well as 
the angles of the clavicula and coracoid relative to each other and 
to the ventral midline. A high scapula was generally associated with 
a more medially located glenoid cavity and with comparably short 
clavicula and coracoid; the long axes of the ventral bones lay approx-
imately parallel to each other and rather perpendicular to the ventral 
midline of the specimen. If a flat scapula was present, the ventral 
bones were angled such that their long axes diverged medially. The 
clavicula was curved, and the anterior and posterior margins of the 
coracoid were comparably straight (inferred from exemplary pecto-
ral girdles shown in Figure 6b as semilandmarks were not included 
in this dataset). The second principal component was also associated 
with differences in the shape and angle of the ventral bones, the 
length of these bones relative to the height of the scapula, and the 
position (in anterior–posterior direction) of the glenoid cavity rela-
tive to the dorsal margin of the scapula.
The phylogenetic signal (Kmult = 0.9595; p = .001) and the ef-
fects of the log-transformed centroid size and locomotor mode on 
shape were statistically significant (Table 3). The locomotor mode

(R2 = 0.19483) accounted for considerably more of the shape vari-
ation than the log-transformed centroid size (R2 = 0.05260). The 
pairwise comparison of mean shapes of locomotor groups revealed 
that climbing species significantly differed from swimming species,

significantly differed from all other locomotor groups, except for 
headfirst burrowers that did not differ from swimmers (Table 4).

3.2 | Shape of the scapula
Most shape variance (79.83%) in the species mean shapes of the 
scapula (landmark dataset ii) was represented by PC 1. This principal 
component was the only significant component and revealed a ten-
dency toward shape differences between non-neobatrachian and 
neobatrachian anurans (Figure  1; both groups roughly separated 
along PC 1 in Figure 7). It was associated with differences in the 
height relative to the width of the scapula, and with the curvature 
of the anterior margin. A high scapula was associated with a con-
cavely shaped anterior margin, whereas the corresponding struc-
ture of a low scapula was rather convex. PC 2 represented 5.63% 
of the variance and, despite its insignificance, was mainly associ-
ated with differences in the torsion of the scapula around its long

jumping and swimming species significantly differed from burrowing 
and climbing species.
3.3 | Shape of the coracoid
The first three PCs of the species mean shapes of the coracoid 
(landmark dataset iii) were significant and, respectively, represented 
59.25%, 14.81%, and 9.15% of the total variance.
Headfirst burrowing and swimming species differed from back-
ward burrowing species along the first two PCs. There was no spe-
cific pattern with regard to group-related shape differences along 
PC 3. The coracoid shapes mainly differed in their length (long axis, 
approx. medial-lateral expansion) relative to their width (anterior–
posterior expansion) in combination with different degrees of cur-
vature of the anterior and posterior margin (Figure 8). These shape 
differences were associated with PC 1. The shape variation along PC 
2 mainly represented differences in the curvature of the long axis in 
the anterior–posterior direction in combination with differences in 
the curvature of the anterior and posterior margins.
The phylogenetic signal in the species mean coracoid shape was 
significant (Kmult = 0.6355; p = .001), yet small compared to the phy-
logenetic signal in the overall pectoral girdle shape and the shape of 
the scapula. The effect of locomotor mode on coracoid shape was 
significant (R2  =  0.25533; Table  6), and the pairwise comparison 
of locomotor group mean shapes (Table 4) showed that backward 
burrowing species significantly differed from all other locomotor 
groups, except for swimming species.
3.4 | Shapes of the cleithrum and clavicula
There were significant phylogenetic signals in the species mean 
shapes of the cleithrum (landmark dataset iv; Kmult = 0.5113; p = .001) 
and the clavicula (landmark dataset v; Kmult = 0.8752; p = .001). The 
pMANOVAs revealed no significant effects of locomotor group or 
log-transformed centroid size and the principal components showed 
no clear pattern of separation of locomotor groups for any of the 
two landmark datasets (iv, v), although the first three (iv) or four (v) 
PCs were significant.

3.5 | Muscle moment arms
The moment arms (Figure 4d–f) of the hypothetical muscles showed 
that the action of the muscles depended on the position of the hu-
merus. The range of humerus positions (protraction–retraction) in 
which the posterior muscles contributed to retraction generally was 
largest in burrowing species. The moment arms of this muscle for 
retraction also were generally larger in burrowing species. The one 
exception to these observations was the backward burrowing spe-
cies Sphaerotheca breviceps which showed comparably small moment 
arms for the posterior muscle during retraction and had a relatively 
small range of humerus positions in which this muscle contributed to 
retraction. The sternal muscle in this species, however, showed simi-
lar properties as the posterior muscles in the other burrowing species.
The properties of the other muscles showed no clear pattern of 
association with locomotor groups. Similar to the sternal muscle, the 
existence of a episternal muscle (if present) increased the moment 
arm for humerus protraction and widened the range of humerus po-
sitions for which the muscles contributed to protraction if compared 
to the anterior muscle of the respective species.
3.6 | Finite element analysis of coracoids
Within each species, lowest mesh-weighted arithmetic mean (mwam) 
von Mises stresses were observed if the coracoid was loaded along 
its long axis (scenario I; Figure 5). Highest stresses occurred if the 
posteromedial surface of the coracoid was pulled backward to simu-
late the potential effect of a m. sterno-epicoracoideus or m. rectus 
abdominis (scenario V), and second-highest stresses occurred if 
the same region was pushed forward to simulated potential forces 
transmitted by a sternum (scenario IV). Across species, the cora-
coid of Breviceps mossambicus experienced lowest mwam von Mises 
stresses under all loading scenarios. The coracoid of Hemisus marmo-
ratus experienced highest mwam von Mises stresses under loading 
through the shoulder joint in lateromedial direction (scenario II) or by 
the hypothetical action of the posterior muscle (scenario III).
4 | DISCUSSION
Our data indicate that the phylogenetic history, the size, and the 
locomotor behavior have significant effects on the shape of the 
pectoral girdle bones of anurans but the relative impact of these fac-
tors differs between bones. The most striking locomotor-behavior-
related shape differences were observed between burrowing and 
nonburrowing species; those differences might be explained by a 
functional adaptation to the burrowing behavior and are possibly as-
sociated with trade-offs. The shapes of the other locomotor groups 
differed less or even not at all and most groups showed remarkable 
within-group shape diversity. Similarly shaped pectoral girdles pro-
vide the anatomical base for different locomotor behaviors, which 
indicates that the processes of many-to-one mapping (i.e., different 
morphologies can result in the same functional performance which 
might lead to a partial decoupling of morphological characters and 
function; Wainwright, Alfaro, Bolnick, & Hulsey,  2005) has acted 
during the evolution of the anuran pectoral girdle.
4.1 | Modularity and phylogenetic signal
The observed differences in the relative impact of the considered 
factors (phylogeny, size, locomotion) on the shape of the distinct 
pectoral girdle bones might indicate some modularity within the 
pectoral girdle of anurans. This is supported by the statistical signifi-
cance of the modularity test, although the result of this test should 
be interpreted with caution, as the test was performed on fixed land-
marks and semilandmarks (Cardini, 2019).
At least some anatomical traits of anurans are influenced by 
their phylogenetic history; among these traits are the absolute 
and relative length of the hind limbs (Gomes, Rezende, Grizante, & 
Navas, 2009), the relative length of the tibiofibula and femur, their 
ratio, and the snout–vent length (Enriquez-Urzelai et  al.,  2015), 
the relative length of the foreleg (Vidal-García, Byrne, Roberts, 
& Keogh,  2014), and several other external body dimensions 
(Sherratt, Vidal-García, Anstis, & Keogh, 2017). Our results are in 
line with these previous studies as the species mean shapes of the 
entire pectoral girdle and of its distinct bones showed a signifi-
cant phylogenetic signal. There were differences, however, in the 
relative strength of the phylogenetic effect on the shapes of the 
single bones as indicated by different values of Kmult. The species 
mean shapes of the scapulae resembled each other more than ex-
pected under a Brownian motion model (Kmult > 1), which implies 
that the phylogenetic history is the major factor in the evolution 
of the scapula shape. This is also supported by the observed dif-
ferences in the shapes of the scapulae of non-neobatrachian and

ENGELKES et al.
neobatrachian species (Figures 1 and 7). The effects of size and lo-
comotor mode, although statistically significant, seem to influence 
the scapula shape to a minor extent. In contrast, the observed 
phylogenetic signal in the species mean coracoid shape was com-
parably small and below the expectation under Brownian motion 
(Kmult < 1). This indicates that other factors (i.e., locomotion) be-
sides phylogeny influence the evolution of the coracoid shape.
Among the factors considered herein, the phylogenetic relation 
seems to be the only factor to determine the shapes of the cleithrum 
and clavicula as the statistical analyses were insignificant for the fac-
tors size and locomotor group. But this might be an artifact caused 
by the GPA or pMANOVA, as the shape of each of these bones was 
analyzed using one curve of more or less colinear semilandmarks 
only. There might be an association of the shape of these bones with 
size or locomotion that was not detected by our analyses.
These observations allow the hypothesis that the evolution of 
the shape of the distinct pectoral girdle bones is driven by different 
primary factors, although they are part of the same complex. If so, 
this could indicate differences in the functional importance of these 
bones.
4.2 | Adaptation of pectoral girdle shape to 
burrowing behavior
The most striking differences in the pectoral girdle shape were ob-
served between burrowing and nonburrowing species (Figures 6 and 
8; Table 4), which is in general accordance with previous studies that 
reported burrowing behavior to be associated with modifications of 
various anatomical structures (summarized in the introduction). The 
mean pectoral girdle shapes of backward and headfirst burrowing 
species significantly differ from one another and from other loco-
motor groups in one or more aspects (Table 4), indicating that the 
pectoral girdle bones of burrowing frogs may be specifically adapted 
to burrowing behavior. In particular, increased moment arms of the 
humerus retractor muscles (herein modeled as the posterior mus-
cle) and widened ranges of humerus positions, for which this mus-
cles acts as a retractor, were observed for most burrowing species 
if compared to nonburrowing species by musculoskeletal modeling 
(Figure 4e). This might be explained by specific biomechanical re-
quirements linked to burrowing.
Emerson (1976) observed that specimens of the headfirst bur-
rowing species Hemisus marmoratus moved the soil by forelimb re-
traction and that this motion was accompanied by a lateral force 
component. She assumed the enlarged retractor muscles and the 
elongated, posteriorly angled coracoids found in this species to be 
adaptations to the headfirst burrowing behavior. Our results indi-
cate additional effects of the shape and orientation of the coracoid: 
The specific configuration of the coracoid shifted the origin of the 
posterior muscle backwards and thereby increased its moment arm 
across the shoulder joint, that is, its effectiveness (Sherman, Seth, 
& Delp, 2013) in humerus retraction if compared to other species 
(Figure 4). In addition, the posterior muscle functioned as a humerus 
retractor in a more anterior humerus position. Both these effects 
seem to be advantageous for headfirst burrowing and, thus, likely 
are adaptations to the burrowing behavior of H. marmoratus.
The finite element analyses revealed that the coracoid of H. 
marmoratus experienced comparable high mesh-weighted arithme-
tic mean von Mises stresses if loading by the posterior muscle (sce-
nario III) or by mediolateral compression (scenario II) was simulated 
(Figure 5c). This is somewhat surprising as both these loading sce-
narios seem ecologically relevant: The posterior muscle simulated 
the forces produced by the humerus retractor muscles, and there 
is a lateral force loading the pectoral girdle during headfirst digging 
(compare Emerson,  1976). The comparably high von Mises stress 
might be a trade-off for the enlarged muscle moment arms across the 
shoulder joint caused by the elongation and specific orientation of 
the coracoid. It should be noted that the force of the posterior muscle 
was simulated for the humerus being orientated perpendicular to the 
sagittal plane; the observations of Emerson (1976) indicate that high-
est digging forces might occur in a more anterior humerus position. 
If so, the peak force imposed by the posterior muscle would be more 
aligned with the long axis of the coracoid, which in turn could result in 
smaller mean von Mises stress (also compare scenario I).
With regard to the pectoral girdle resisting to medially directed 
compression, it is noteworthy that the clavicula in H. marmoratus is 
angled rather perpendicular to the ventral midline, more robust, and 
enlarged medially (Figure 6b; also see Braus, 1919; Emerson, 1976). 
This shape and orientation somewhat resemble the configuration 
of the coracoid in some other species, and we hypothesize that, in 
H. marmoratus, the clavicula replaces the coracoid, for example, in 
transmitting and dissipating medially directed compressive forces 
through the shoulder joint. If this was true and the clavicula resisted 
most of the forces imposed by a medially directed compression, 
the mediolateral bending of the coracoid would be considerably re-
duced, which in turn would have led to smaller von Mises stresses in 
the coracoid. Such an effect was not observed in our simulations as 
we artificially removed the clavicula and the scapula, but the fusion 
of these two bones to the coracoid (Figure 6b) might be an indicator 
for their interaction in force transmission.
The specific clavicula configuration observed in H. marmoratus 
results in a small moment arm for the anterior muscle (Figure 4d) 
with regard to humerus protraction. Such small moment arms with 
regard to humerus protraction should be a disadvantage for head-
first burrowing as the retracted humerus needs to be moved forward 
for a new digging cycle. The bony episterum in H. marmoratus might 
have evolved to compensate for this disadvantage by expanding 
the area for muscle attachment anteriorly, which in turn leads to a 
larger moment arm across the shoulder joint (see episternal muscle 
in Figure 4d; also compare Trueb, 1973).
Large moment arms for the humerus retractor muscles seem to 
be a requirement for backward burrowing, too (compare Figure 4e), 
but the reason for this is not as obvious as for headfirst burrow-
ing. To our knowledge, no detailed description of the function 
of the forelimbs (i.e., the forces acting on them) during backward 
burrowing does exist. The forelimbs are species-specifically either

used to stabilize the body (Emerson, 1976; Sanders & Davies, 1983) 
or to turn the body in the excavated hole (Sanders & Davies, 1983) 
during backward burrowing. Considering these functions, it might 
be hypothesized that the humerus retractor muscles mainly act to 
stabilize the shoulder joint while digging with the hind limbs, but this 
needs to be investigated in future studies.
It is remarkable that the coracoid of Breviceps mossambicus ex-
perienced lowest von Mises stresses in the finite element analyses 
(Figure 5d). Among the simulated loading scenarios, the resistance 
to lateral compression (scenario II) and to forces imposed by the 
humerus retractor muscles (scenario III) seem to be the most eco-
logically relevant, as backward digging is associated with a lateral 
force component (Emerson, 1976) and the retractor muscles likely 
are active during digging. The specific coracoid shape may thus be 
an adaptation to the backward burrowing behavior in B. mossambi-
cus and comes at the cost of a small moment arm of the posterior 
muscle with regard to humerus retraction (Figure 4e). Analogous to 
the episternum in H. marmoratus (and other species), the pars ossea 
of the sternum in B. mossambicus might have evolved to compen-
sate for this presumably disadvantageous moment arm (also com-
pare Trueb, 1973). Cartilaginous episternal or sternal elements, as 
described for various species (e.g., Braus,  1919; Fürbringer,  1873; 
Trueb,  1973), were not considered herein. Yet, they might have 
a similar advantageous effect on muscle moment arms across the 
shoulder joint and should be included in future studies.
Two further observations support the hypothesis that the pec-
toral girdles of different species are adapted to their burrowing: 
Alytes cisternasii has been reported to be the faster and more effi-
cient headfirst burrower if compared to the also headfirst burrow-
ing A. obstetricans (Brown & Crespo, 2000). This coincides with the 
pectoral girdle shape of A. obstetricans being within the range of 
walking, hopping and jumping species, whereas the shape of A. cis-
ternasii more resembles that of other headfirst burrowing species 
(Figure  6a). Thus, some anatomical specialization in the pectoral 
girdle of A. cisternasii might allow this species to perform better in 
burrowing. Despite the significant phylogenetic signal, the shape 
differences in the pectoral girdles of the jumping species Pseudacris 
triseriata and the headfirst burrowing species P. streckeri are compa-
rably large with the latter more closely resembling the shape of other 
burrowing species (Figure 6a).
4.3 | Walking, hopping, and jumping
In contrast to previous studies (see introduction for a summary), our 
analyses indicate that there is no specific pectoral girdle shape as-
sociated with either of these locomotor modes (Table 4) and, in par-
ticular, both locomotor groups do not differ in their mean pectoral 
girdle shape. Instead, walking, hopping and jumping species display a 
remarkable within-group shape diversity in the pectoral girdle bones 
and their orientation to one another (Figures 6–8). It appears that 
differently shaped pectoral girdles are equally suited to fulfill the 
biomechanical requirements of jumping or walking, hopping.
4.4 | Swimming and climbing
Swimming species significantly differed from headfirst burrowing 
species, as well as climbing from jumping species in the mean shapes 
of the scapulae only. These differences, although observed in the 
context of locomotor behavior, could be caused by the phylogenetic 
structure of the respective locomotor groups: The group of swim-
ming species consisted of mostly non-neobatrachians whereas the 
group of headfirst burrowing species consisted of non-neobatrachi-
ans and neobatrachians (Figure  1). Given the strong phylogenetic 
signal in the scapula shape, this unequal phylogenetic pattern in lo-
comotor group composition alone might have separated both groups 
in morphospace and there might be no true shape difference caused 
by differences in the locomotor behavior (also see the discussion of 
group dispersion across the phylogeny in Adams & Collyer, 2018).
The potential lack of a specific pectoral girdle shape within 
aquatic species might be explained by the fact that most anurans 
are good swimmers and likely have pectoral girdles that allow for 
an efficient aquatic locomotion. If so, the pectoral girdle shape of 
purely aquatic species would not differ much from nonaquatic spe-
cies. An additional explanation for the nonspecific pectoral girdle 
shape of swimming anurans might be that the forelimbs are involved 
in swimming to only a minor extent (Abourachid & Green,  1999; 
Gillis & Biewener,  2000) and thus likely impose rather unspecific 
biomechanical requirements on the pectoral girdle. In addition, the 
effect of gravity is reduced in water (Zug, 1971) which would result 
in, among other things, minor forces acting on the pectoral girdle. 
Instead of being optimized for a high locomotor performance, the 
pectoral girdle of aquatic anuran species might be adapted to other 
ecologically relevant tasks like suction feeding (Cundall, Fernandez, 
& Irish, 2017). The morphological adaptation to swimming might have 
primarily occurred in other anatomical traits (Gómez & Lires, 2019; 
Laurent, 1964; Moen, 2019; Videler & Jorna, 1985).
Following the lines of argumentation above, it might be possible 
that there is no locomotor-behavior-related shape difference be-
tween jumping and climbing species, as the latter group consisted 
of neobatrachian species only, whereas the former additionally con-
tained non-neobatrachians. It is noteworthy that climbing evolved 
several times independently within the Neobatrachia only (Reilly & 
Jorgensen, 2011). Considering the phylogenetic distribution of ar-
boreality, some specific anatomical novelties might have evolved 
in the last common ancestor of neobatrachian anurans and might 
have been necessary for the evolution of climbing behavior. The 
development of a fibrous epidermis with modified mucus glands 
on the finger and toe pads seems a promising candidate for such a 
novelty, as these specifications are not present in the non-neoba-
trachian species Ascaphus truei, Alytes obstetricans, and Scaphiopus 
holbrookii (Noble & Jaeckle, 1928). In addition, those glands evolved 
before arboreality in certain anuran linages and were suggested to 
lead to climbing ability if combined with enlarged toe pads (Noble 
& Jaeckle, 1928). The lack of such a novelty might have constrained 
non-neobatrachians from developing climbing behavior. Given that 
neobatrachians have comparably high scapulae and that climbing

ENGELKES et al.
has evolved within neobatrachians only, these specific shapes seem 
to be associated with climbing although the true reason for the asso-
ciation likely is phylogenetic relatedness. All this is speculative at this 
stage and requires further investigation.
4.5 | Many-to-one mapping and trade-offs
The locomotor groups in our study showed a remarkable within-
group pectoral girdle shape diversity (Figures  6–8). Differently 
shaped pectoral girdles within a given locomotor group, thus, pro-
vide the anatomical base for similar locomotor behavior. This phe-
nomenon of different forms allowing similar functions is known as 
many-to-one mapping (Wainwright et al., 2005) and, although not 
named as such, has previously been indicated for the anuran pec-
toral girdle. Arciferal and firmisternal pectoral girdles showed no 
considerable differences in patterns of deformation if compressively 
loaded through the shoulder joint (Emerson, 1984) and should thus 
be equally suited to accomplish tasks that require the resistance 
to lateral forces. Both girdle types, however, differ in the mecha-
nism of how these forces are dissipated (Emerson, 1983; also see 
Figure 5). One additional example of many-to-one mapping has been 
observed in our study: Similar moment arms of the posterior muscle 
are produced by different pectoral girdle shapes in burrowing spe-
cies (Figure 4). The coracoids in the respective girdles presumably 
accomplish different functions, namely either shifting the attach-
ment area of the posterior muscle posteriorly or resisting mediolat-
eral forces.
We observed few, if any, significant shape differences be-
tween swimming, jumping, climbing and walking, hopping species, 
and large regions of overlap of locomotor groups in morphospace 
(Figures  6–8). Similarly shaped pectoral girdles, thus, provide the 
anatomical base for different locomotor behaviors. This might be 
associated with trade-offs imposed by conflicting biomechanical 
demands (Herrel, van Damme, Vanhooydonck, Zaaf, & Aerts, 2000). 
On the other hand, many-to-one mapping is thought to allow for 
the simultaneous optimization of multiple biomechanical properties 
(Wainwright, 2007; Wainwright et al., 2005), so that a given pectoral 
girdle shape might be equally adapted to several locomotor behav-
iors without functional trade-offs.
Both, many-to-one mapping and trade-offs, might have occurred 
during the evolution of the morphological diversity in anurans. 
For example, Moen (2019) observed many-to-one mapping in the 
relative hind limb length and relative hind limb muscle mass onto 
swimming and jumping performance. Neither trade-offs nor cou-
pled optimization between the independently evolved (Abourachid 
& Green,  1999; Astley,  2016) locomotor modes of swimming and 
jumping were observed for the hind limb anatomy of a semiaquatic 
frog (Nauwelaerts, Ramsay, & Aerts, 2007). Anurans with different 
pelvic and hind leg morphologies showed similar swimming abilities 
and that there was no trade-off with jumping performance (Gal & 
Blake,  1987). These reports indicate many-to-one mapping (but 
see Robovská-Havelkova et  al.,  2014 for a report of species with 
different ecologies showing different kinematic patterns of hind 
limb motion during swimming). A trade-off has been reported be-
tween the maximum jumping distance and the jumping endurance 
with larger jumping distances being accompanied by an earlier 
onset of fatigue (Rand, 1952; Zug, 1978, 1985). Additionally, the rel-
atively short legs of burrowing species are thought to be a trade-
off between efficient burrowing and jumping performance (Gomes 
et al., 2009). With regard to the anuran pectoral girdle, further stud-
ies are needed to analyze the biomechanical properties and resulting 
locomotor performances in order to assess which mechanisms, ma-
ny-to-one mapping, trade-offs, or both, acted during the evolution 
of this functional complex.
4.6 | Potentially undetected adaptation of pectoral 
girdle shape to function
Despite our observations, there might be some functional adapta-
tion of the pectoral girdle shape to more specific motion patterns 
than implied by our coarse definitions of walking, hopping, jump-
ing, swimming, and climbing. Following Emerson (1979), we defined 
walking, hopping, and jumping locomotion based on the maximal 
leap length achieved by a given species. The length of a leap is deter-
mined during the initial phase of a jump by the amount of propulsive 
forces generated by the hind limbs (Hirano & Rome, 1984). If active 
at all, the forelimbs only raise the body and control the takeoff angle 
and do not contribute much to force generation (Akella & Gillis, 2011; 
Wang et al., 2014). This means that the pectoral girdle experiences 
comparably low forces during the initial phase and there might be no 
selective pressure for a specific girdle shape or function. Different 
landing behaviors have evolved within hopping or jumping anurans 
ranging from “belly flops” that do not involve the forelimbs, to coor-
dinated landing during which the impact forces are transmitted and 
dissipated by the forelimbs and the pectoral girdle (Emerson, 1983; 
Essner, Suffian, Bishop, & Reilly,  2010; Griep et  al.,  2013; Reilly 
et al., 2016). Likewise, various landing patterns have been observed 
in an arboreal frog (Bijma, Gorb, & Kleinteich, 2016) and some climb-
ing species are capable of parachuting or gliding (Oliver, 1951; also 
see Appendix S1: Tables A1, A2). It seems reasonable to assume that 
these different landing behaviors, as well as parachuting and gliding, 
are associated with different force patterns that act on the pecto-
ral girdle and require specific skeletal and muscular geometries to 
be dissipated, particularly as landing force can be up to three times 
higher than the forces generated during takeoff (Nauwelaerts & 
Aerts, 2006).
The forelimbs of anurans are involved in other species-specific 
behaviors besides locomotion as, for example, prey manipulation 
(Gray, O’Reilly, & Nishikawa, 1997) or wiping of the body surface 
(Blaylock, Ruibal, & Platt-Aloia,  1976). The shapes of the pectoral 
girdle bones might be functionally adapted to these specific motion 
patterns and, given the significant phylogenetic signal and the po-
tential effects of many-to-one mapping, might occur on a smaller 
 20457758, 2020, 20, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.6784 by California Digital Library University Of California, Wiley Online Library on [09/05/2025].

ENGELKES et al.
scale within closely related groups. These hypotheses were not 
tested herein.
The literature record on anuran behavior and our definition of 
locomotor groups might be insufficient to fully represent the behav-
ior of at least some species. For example, the backward burrowing 
species Rhinophrynus dorsalis is hypothesized to be capable of head-
first burrowing (Trueb & Gans, 1983). Aplastodiscus leucopygius is an 
arboreal species (Ferreira et al., 2008; Haddad & Sawaya, 2000), but 
at least the males have been observed to use their heads for the 
construction of subterranean nests that serve for egg deposition 
(Haddad & Sawaya, 2000). Both these species are located within or 
close to the region acclaimed by the group of headfirst burrowing 
anurans in morphospaces (Figures 6–8). Headfirst burrowing might 
thus require a pectoral girdle with specific biomechanical proper-
ties (potentially realized by different morphologies) and there, thus, 
might be adaptations to locomotor behavior that were not detected 
by our approach.
4.7 | Limitations and future perspectives
Most anuran species in our sample were represented by one speci-
men only, and shape analyses were performed on the mean shapes 
of species. We did not consider sexual dimorphism, although this 
phenomenon has been reported for the humerus in some species 
(Lee, 2001; Padhye, Jadhav, Sulakhe, & Dahanukar, 2015; Petrović, 
Vukov, & Kolarov,  2017) and some muscles originating from the 
pectoral girdle (Emerson,  1990; Lee,  2001; Oka, Ohtani, Satou, & 
Ueda, 1984). Sexual dimorphism may, thus, be expected to occur in 
the pectoral girdle bones, too. Nevertheless, we expect these limita-
tions to have a minor effect on our results, as the shapes of all land-
mark sets of a given species lay mostly within the same respective 
locomotor group in morphospace or expanded the region claimed by 
the locomotor group toward more extreme shapes without enlarg-
ing the overlap with other locomotor groups (Figure 6). Yet, sexual 
dimorphism and intraspecific variability in the shape of the anuran 
pectoral girdle bones would be interesting topics for future studies 
and, if combined with behavioral and biomechanical analyses, could 
shed light on the functional and ecological consequences of shape 
differences.
Muscle moment arms were simulated using a simplified humerus 
with all hypothetical muscles inserting at the same point in order to 
assess the effects of different pectoral girdle geometries indepen-
dent of other factors. As Emerson (1991) argued, the length of the 
humerus and the location of the muscle attachments along its length 
influence the resulting mechanical advantage. Thus, our analysis ex-
plored only one aspect among the factors determining the biome-
chanical properties of the shoulder joint. Assessing the combined 
effects of pectoral girdle and humerus shape, as well as the con-
sideration of species-specific muscle configurations, could provide 
further insight into the functionality of this complex and explain its 
evolution.
