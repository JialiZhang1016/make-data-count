Abstract.—Species are fundamental units in biological research and can be deﬁned on the basis of various operational criteria.
There has been growing use of molecular approaches for species delimitation. Among the most widely used methods, the
generalized mixed Yule-coalescent (GMYC) and Poisson tree processes (PTP) were designed for the analysis of single-locus
data but are often applied to concatenations of multilocus data. In contrast, the Bayesian multispecies coalescent approach
in the software Bayesian Phylogenetics and Phylogeography (BPP) explicitly models the evolution of multilocus data. In this
study, we compare the performance of GMYC, PTP, and BPP using synthetic data generated by simulation under various
speciation scenarios. We show that in the absence of gene ﬂow, the main factor inﬂuencing the performance of these methods
is the ratio of population size to divergence time, while number of loci and sample size per species have smaller effects.
Given appropriate priors and correct guide trees, BPP shows lower rates of species overestimation and underestimation, and
is generally robust to various potential confounding factors except high levels of gene ﬂow. The single-threshold GMYC and
the best strategy that we identiﬁed in PTP generally perform well for scenarios involving more than a single putative species
when gene ﬂow is absent, but PTP outperforms GMYC when fewer species are involved. Both methods are more sensitive
than BPP to the effects of gene ﬂow and potential confounding factors. Case studies of bears and bees further validate some of
the ﬁndings from our simulation study, and reveal the importance of using an informed starting point for molecular species
delimitation. Our results highlight the key factors affecting the performance of molecular species delimitation, with potential
beneﬁts for using these methods within an integrative taxonomic framework. [Molecular species delimitation; speciation;
multispecies coalescent; simulation; generalized mixed Yule-coalescent; Poisson tree processes; Bayesian phylogenetics.]
Species identiﬁcation is critical to a wide range of
biological research, including studies of evolution,
conservation,
and
biodiversity.
However,
various
operational criteria are used for species identiﬁcation,
depending on the species concept that is being invoked
(de Queiroz 2007). Among the most widely used are
the biological species concept, which is based on
reproductive isolation (Mayr 1942; Dobzhansky 1950),
and the phylogenetic species concept, which is based
on reciprocal monophyly (Rosen 1979; Baum and Shaw
1995). In contrast, morphology-based taxonomy usually
appeals to the phenetic species concept (Michener
1970; Sokal and Crovello 1970), which remains a key
framework for species identiﬁcation in practice.
The last decade has witnessed the growing availability
of genetic methods for species identiﬁcation, providing
a valuable complement to morphological taxonomy.
Some of the widely used approaches for validating
putative species are based on comparison of intra-
and interspeciﬁc genetic distances (Hebert et al. 2003,
2004; Mallo and Posada 2016). These methods are
contentious, however, partly because they do not appeal
to an explicit species concept (Rubinoff et al. 2006a,
2006b; Waugh 2007). By contrast, the goal of molecular
species delimitation is to build a taxonomic scheme for
a set of samples and to infer a de novo delimitation
of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (Tautz et al.
2003; Vogler and Monaghan 2007; Mallo and Posada
2016). Within this burgeoning ﬁeld, most methods
appeal to the phylogenetic species concept and identify
minimal phylogenetic units as the OTUs (Goldstein
et al. 2000). These methods include the generalized
mixed Yule-coalescent (GMYC) model (Pons et al.
2006; Fujisawa and Barraclough 2013), Poisson tree
processes (PTP) model (Zhang et al. 2013; Kapli et al.
2017), Bayes factor delimitation (Grummer et al. 2014;
Leaché et al. 2014), Bayesian coalescent method in the
software Bayesian Phylogenetics and Phylogeography
(BPP) (Yang 2015), and phylogeographic inference using
approximate likelihoods (Jackson et al. 2017). Molecular
speciesdelimitationhasbeenemployedeitherasastand-
alone method or as part of an integrative taxonomic
approach to species identiﬁcation (e.g., Bond and
Stockman 2008; Hotaling et al. 2016; Mason et al. 2016).
Methods of molecular species delimitation differ
from each other in a number of respects. Among
the widely used methods, Automatic Barcode Gap
Discovery (ABGD) is one of the most computationally
efﬁcient. It requires the a priori speciﬁcation of an
intraspeciﬁc distance threshold, and the method is based
on genetic distances computed from a single locus rather
than an explicit species concept (Puillandre et al. 2012).
The GMYC method also analyzes data from a single
locus, but requires an ultrametric estimate of the gene

tree. Studies have found that its performance is affected
primarily by the ratio of population sizes to species
divergence times, but also by varying population sizes,
number of species involved, and number of sampling
singletons (Fujisawa and Barraclough 2013; Dellicour
and Flot 2015; Ahrens et al. 2016). Empirical studies
have shown that ABGD and GMYC tend to under- and
oversplit species, respectively (e.g., Paz and Crawford
2012; Pentinsaari et al. 2017; Renner et al. 2017). As
with GMYC, PTP requires an estimate of the gene tree,
but with branch lengths proportional to the amount of
genetic change rather than to time. It tends to outperform
GMYC when interspeciﬁc distances are small (Zhang et
al. 2013), though the two methods often produce similar
estimates of species limits (e.g., Lang et al. 2015; Arrigoni
et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2016). GMYC and PTP were
originally designed for the analysis of single-locus data,
but are often applied to concatenated multilocus data by
postulating a shared genealogical history (e.g., Arrigoni
et al. 2016; Nieto-Montes de Oca et al. 2017; Renner et al.
2017).
In contrast with the methods described above, the
Bayesian method in BPP was designed to analyze
multiple
loci
but
is
much
more
computationally
intensive (Yang 2015). It performs well when appropriate
priors are chosen, with low rates of false positives
and false negatives under most evolutionary scenarios
(Yang and Rannala 2010, 2014; Zhang et al. 2011, 2014).
Although the biological species concept provides the
motivation for assuming limited gene ﬂow between
species, BPP appears to be robust to low levels of gene
ﬂow (Zhang et al. 2011). Studies with both simulated
and empirical data have shown that BPP is more
accurate than other multilocus coalescent methods (such
as the information-theoretic and approximate Bayesian
frameworks), while being somewhat sensitive to the
number of loci and to the information content (Ence and
Carstens 2011; Camargo et al. 2012; Hime et al. 2016).
Empirical studies have also shown that BPP can produce
delimitations that are consistent with those from other
widely used methods such as GMYC and PTP (e.g.,
Hoppeler et al. 2016; Previši´c et al. 2016; Nieto-Montes de
Oca et al. 2017). Species delimitations by BPP are used
widely not only for explicit taxon identiﬁcation, but also
as an important procedure in analyses of taxon evolution
and divergence (e.g., Ruane et al. 2014; Moritz et al. 2018).
Most genetic methods for species identiﬁcation,
especially those based on the phylogenetic species
concept, do not explicitly account for the mode of
speciation. There are three main modes of speciation
that differ in terms of the assumed degree of gene
ﬂow: allopatric, parapatric, and sympatric speciation
(Gavrilets 2003). In each case, the formation of incipient
species is related to a reduction in gene ﬂow, which
is at the core of the biological species concept. Some
view speciation as a gradual and protracted process
independent of any species concept (Rosindell et al.
2010; Etienne et al. 2014). For these reasons, there
appears to be a gap between what we would consider
to be “good” species and the taxonomic units inferred
by coalescent-based methods of molecular species
delimitation. This can be addressed by examining the
congruence between genetic divergence and speciation.
Some methods, such as GMYC and PTP, assume
that gene trees accurately reﬂect the diversiﬁcation of
species, whereas BPP acknowledges the possibility of
discordance between the two (Yang and Rannala 2010).
This discordance is presumed to be caused primarily by
among-gene differences in lineage sorting, but it can also
be due to systematic error (e.g., model misspeciﬁcation)
and stochastic error (e.g., sampling scheme) (Mallo et al.
2014; Mallo and Posada 2016).
In this study, we compare the performance of three
widely used methods of species delimitation, GMYC,
PTP, and BPP, using both single-locus and multilocus
sequence data generated by simulation under various
speciation scenarios. We characterize the behavior of
these methods, their delimitation efﬁcacy, and their
sensitivity to potential confounding factors. In addition,
we validate some of the features of these methods in
case studies involving sequence data from bears and
bees. Our results provide practical guidelines for using
molecular methods of species delimitation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Models and Assumptions
To examine the performance of species delimitation
using GMYC, PTP, and BPP, we simulated the evolution
of sequence data under ﬁve speciation scenarios (Fig. 1):
1) no speciation; 2) speciation into two species with
cessation of gene ﬂow; 3) speciation into two species
with ongoing gene ﬂow; 4) speciation into ﬁve species
with cessation of gene ﬂow; and 5) speciation into
four species with ongoing gene ﬂow. In each case, we
assumed Wright–Fisher panmixia within each species.
Scenario I is treated as the null case in this study.
Scenario II can represent either allopatric or peripatric
speciation, depending on the combination of population

sizes between the two species. Scenario III involves
reduced but ongoing gene ﬂow, so it can be taken
to represent either parapatric or sympatric speciation.
Scenarios IV and V are extensions of Scenarios II and
III, respectively; we chose to model the evolution of ﬁve
and four species in these scenarios, to allow variation
in the tree topology and for practical convenience. In
these scenarios, speciation can also be regarded as the
formation of separate populations, and migration as
being interchangeable with other forms of gene ﬂow
(e.g., introgression). We assumed that all speciation
events were bifurcating, and that all genes evolved
neutrally without gene conversion, gene duplication, or
horizontal transfer.
Evolutionary Simulations
Nucleotide sequence evolution was simulated under
each of the ﬁve scenarios (Table 1), with assumptions of
a constant rate of 10−8 mutations per site per generation
and a generation time of 1 year. Owing to its convenience
and versatility, we preferred to use SimPhy (Mallo et al.
2016) to generate the trees, where possible. The species
tree was simulated ﬁrst, and then we simulated the
evolution of 100 independent gene trees conditioned
on the species tree. For simulations that could not
be performed using SimPhy, we used makesamples
(Hudson 2002) to simulate the evolution of 100 gene trees
based on each species tree that we speciﬁed.
Under each set of simulation conditions (see below;
Table 1), we randomly subsampled varying numbers
of gene trees (l=1, 2, 5, 10, and 20) from the 100
generatedbySimPhyormakesamples.Thesecorrespond
to varying numbers of loci, because each gene tree
corresponds to the evolutionary history of a single locus.
We performed the jackkniﬁng procedure 10 times for
each number of loci. For each sampled gene tree, we
then used Seq-Gen v1.3.2 (Rambaut and Grassly 1997) to
simulate the evolution of a sequence alignment of length
1000 bp, using the Jukes–Cantor model of nucleotide
substitution (Jukes and Cantor 1969). An outgroup
sequence was added to the sequence alignment for
each of the ﬁve scenarios during simulation, but
was removed for the species-delimitation analyses.
All data generated by our simulations are available
in Supplementary Material of this article available

Appendix S1.
Scenario
I.—We
began
simulations
with
the
null
scenario of a single, unstructured population or species
(Fig. 1a), under the classical Wright–Fisher model in
makesamples. We set 15 combinations of sample sizes
(i.e., the number of sampled individuals per species) and
population sizes. Sample sizes (n=2, 4, 10, 20, and 40)
were double those used in Scenario II (as appropriate
for some methods of species delimitation), whereas
population sizes (N =104, 105, and 106) were consistent
with the general settings used in Scenario II. After
producing 10 replicates for each number of loci (l=1,
2, 5, 10, and 20), we had a total of 750 datasets.
Scenario II.—This scenario involves two reproductively
isolated species with equal population sizes and with
equal numbers of sampled individuals (Fig. 1b). In
SimPhy, we chose: n=1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 samples per
species (as appropriate for the relevant delimitation
methods; Luo et al. 2015); population sizes of N =104,
105, and 106 for each species; and divergence times of
t=107,106, and 105 years between the two species. These
yielded a total of 45 combinations of parameters. Larger
population sizes and divergence times lead to greater
genetic variation within species and between species,
respectively; the ranges of values investigated in our
study are generally consistent with the features of a
broad range of eukaryotic species (Zhang et al. 2011;
Fujisawa and Barraclough 2013). Taking into account
the variation in the number of loci, our simulations
produced a total of 2250 datasets. Based on the results
from our analyses of these datasets, we chose the
basic settings for the remaining simulations (including
supplementary settings for BPP and variations of
Scenario II). These results, together with those from
Scenario I, provided benchmarks for interpreting the
results from the other Scenarios and also informed the
best strategy in PTP for analyzing our remaining data.
For species delimitation using BPP in particular,
supplementary settings included: extreme population

sizes for each species (N =103 and 107), with species
divergence time t=106 and n=1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 samples
per species; and larger sample size n=50 with N =106
and t=105. Unless otherwise noted, the simulations for
Scenario II described below exclude the supplementary
settings used for BPP.
In addition, we considered a series of variations of
Scenario II, involving potential confounding factors that
might inﬂuence species delimitations inferred by the
three methods. These included: simulating sequence
evolution using makesamples vs. SimPhy for the core
settings in Scenario II, to evaluate the consistency of
our methods; differing vs. equal population sizes for
the two species; exponentially growing vs. constant-size
populations; uneven sampling vs. equal sample sizes
from the two species; and substitution rate heterogeneity
across species, across loci, or across lineages (see
Supplementary Appendix S2 available on Dryad for
details).
Scenario III.—This scenario involves two sister species
with ongoing gene ﬂow (Fig. 1c). Gene ﬂow is speciﬁed
by the migration rate Mij. In makesamples, Mij =4Nimij
(i, j=1,..., number of populations), where mij is the
fraction of population i that is made up of migrants
from population j each generation, and Ni is the size
of population i. To test the effect of ongoing gene
ﬂow on species delimitation, we set Mij =0.1, 1, 10,
102, and 103, and assumed equal amounts of reciprocal
gene ﬂow. In light of the results from Scenario II and
general applicability to most empirical studies, we set the
population size of each species to N =104, the divergence
time of the two species to t=106, and the sample size
per species to n=10. These settings were combined with
variation in the number of loci, as described above for
Scenarios I and II.
Scenario IV.—We examined a ﬁve-species case in which
speciation followed a Yule process (i.e., birth–death
process with extinction rate zero; Yule 1924) (Fig. 1d),
and considered a range of speciation rates (r=10−5,
10−6, 10−7, and 10−8 speciation events per year) for
ﬁve species with the relationship ((A,B),(D,(C,E))). The
most recent common ancestor of these species was set
to 107 years before present, with each species having
a population size N =104 and with n=10 samples per
species. We used SimPhy to simulate speciation with a
pure-birthprocess,conditionedonthecrownageandthe
number of extant species (Hartmann et al. 2010). Under
these constraints, higher speciation rates (e.g., r=10−5)
tended to produce trees with internal nodes closer to the
tips (Supplementary Appendix S3 available on Dryad).
Based on these settings, we performed simulations with
various numbers of loci.
Scenario V.—We examined a four-species case in which
gene ﬂow is conditioned on the geographic proximity of
the species (Fig. 1e). The species have the relationship
((A,B),(C,D)), and gene ﬂow occurs reciprocally between
A and B, between B and C, and between C and D. Rates of
gene ﬂow match those in Scenario III. In makesamples,
we assumed that divergences between sister species A
and B and between C and D occurred 106 years ago,
and that the four species had their most recent common
ancestor 107 years ago. Each species was assumed to
have a population size of N =104, with n=10 samples
per species. Under each set of conditions, we performed
simulations with various numbers of loci. In addition to
the complete datasets, sequences of species pairs (A, B),
(A, C), (A, D), and (B, C) were extracted separately so that
we could explicitly test the effect of geographic distance
on species delimitation.
Species Delimitation
We
performed
species
delimitation
using
three
different methods: GMYC, PTP, and BPP. With the
assumption that species are reciprocally monophyletic,
GMYC uses a likelihood approach to identify the
boundary between a Yule speciation process and
intraspeciﬁc coalescence. This is done with reference
to the relative node times in an ultrametric tree. To
obtain these trees, we ﬁrst inferred phylograms with
maximumlikelihoodinRAxMLv8.2.9(Stamatakis2014).
We pruned non-unique sequences prior to phylogenetic
inference, and conducted rapid full analyses with the
Jukes–Cantor substitution model and 1000 bootstrap
replicates. The phylograms were then made ultrametric
through computing relative evolutionary times using
the penalized-likelihood method in r8s v1.7 (Sanderson
2003), with a smoothing parameter of 10. Although
a
multiple-threshold
version
of
GMYC
has
been
developed (Monaghan et al. 2009), we only used the
single-threshold version of GMYC because it has been
shown to outperform the multiple-threshold version
(Fujisawa and Barraclough 2013; Talavera et al. 2013).
Species delimitation was done using the package splits
v1.0-19 (Ezard et al. 2009) in R (R Core Team 2016).
PTP identiﬁes the transition points between inter- and
intraspeciﬁc branching events. The method postulates
that the number of substitutions between species is
signiﬁcantly higher than that within species, with any
individual substitution having a low probability of
causing speciation. The mean numbers of substitutions
until speciation events and until coalescent events are
expected to follow exponential distributions, forming
two independent Poisson processes on the tree. Since
PTPdoesnotrequireanultrametrictree,wedirectlyused
the phylograms inferred in RAxML as described above.
We employed three strategies in PTP: PTP heuristic (PTP-
h) v2.2, Bayesian PTP maximum likelihood (bPTP-ML)
v0.51, and Bayesian PTP heuristic (bPTP-h) v0.51, but
did not consider the most recently proposed strategy,
multi-rate PTP (Kapli et al. 2017; but see Discussion). For
bPTP-ML and bPTP-h, we carried out two independent
Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analyses,

with each chain having a length of 106 steps and
the ﬁrst 25% discarded as burn-in. After checking for
convergence between chains, we reported the results
from one of the two chains. For PTP-h, the minimal
branch length was set to 10−6, with other parameters
left at their default values.
BPP delimits species in the multispecies coalescent
framework, which assumes that the gene trees evolve
within the constraints of the species tree (Rannala
and Yang 2003). It uses reversible-jump MCMC to
move between delimitation models while calculating
posterior probabilities. We used BPP v3.3a to analyze
our simulated single- and multilocus datasets based
on guide trees that matched those used for simulation.
Algorithms 0 and 1 (Yang and Rannala 2010) were used
in two independent runs with default parameters, with
each having 106 MCMC iterations following a discarded
burn-in of 10,000 iterations. We checked for convergence
between the two runs and combined the MCMC samples
to produce estimates of the posterior probabilities of
various delimitation models. For all datasets, we placed
diffuse gamma priors G(1,500) on all  parameters and
G(1,100) on the root age 0 of species trees. These
values are generally consistent with the settings in our
simulations. For datasets from Scenario I, we randomly
assigned equal numbers of sequences to each of two
arbitrary species. For datasets with rate heterogeneity
among loci, species delimitation was performed with
a model of variable rates among loci, speciﬁed using a
Dirichlet distribution with =2 (Burgess and Yang 2008;
Zhang et al. 2011).
Evaluation of Performance
The three methods examined in this study produce
species delimitations in different forms. For species
delimitation using BPP, we recorded the posterior
probabilities of different delimitation models (e.g., P1
for the one-species model and P2 for the two-species
model), and considered the rates of false positives and
false negatives. For the results from GMYC and PTP,
we based our evaluations on the most well supported
species delimitations to capture the broad patterns.
However, we did not take into account the support
valuesfordelimitedentities,whichshouldbeconsidered
when the focus of the investigation is on particular taxa.
We calculated the number of delimited OTUs for each
simulated species where delimitations were available,
although this measure lacks the capacity to distinguish
between certain outcomes (e.g., it cannot differentiate
between the situations depicted in Fig. 2a,b, as illustrated
below).
To enable the results to be described in ﬁner detail, we
used ﬁve categories to summarize the delimitations of
GMYC and PTP for every species pair (Fig. 2). Because
our focus is on the overall quality of delimitation rather
than the number of delimited OTUs, these categories
are largely intended to evaluate the performance of
GMYC and PTP. First, two species might be correctly

categories are similar, but not identical, to those deﬁned
by Ratnasingham and Hebert (2013). A ﬁfth category
comprises the cases in which we were unable to obtain
a species delimitation (“not available” or “NA”).
GMYC and PTP can fail to yield a species delimitation
under various circumstances. Because the trees were
pruned so that they only contained unique sequences
prior to phylogenetic inference, maximum-likelihood
trees were unavailable for some datasets. This was
problematic for both GMYC and PTP. In addition, PTP-h
can fail to yield a deﬁnite species delimitation due to the
failure of the likelihood-ratio test, because we used the
default cut-off of P=0.001 (Zhang 2013). In some cases,
GMYC encountered computing errors, particularly for
datasets comprising fewer sequences. Trees with zero
branch lengths are actually compatible with PTP, but
for convenience we preferred to include NAs for bPTP-h
and bPTP-ML. For delimitations inferred for data from
Scenario I, which involves a single species, we did not
consider false negatives and complex false positives.

LUO ET AL.—COMPARING METHODS FOR SPECIES DELIMITATION

Case Studies
Our simulation study was designed to provide an
insight into the performance of species-delimitation
methods with data generated under known conditions.
However, the idealized settings of our simulations might
not adequately reﬂect the complex conditions under
which real sequences have evolved. Therefore, based on
the results from our simulation study, we carried out
additional comparisons of species-delimitation methods
using empirical datasets of bears and bees. These
datasets comprise sequences of mitochondrial genes,
which are expected to have congruent gene trees because
of the absence of recombination in the mitochondrial
genome.
Bears.—The genus Ursus (Carnivora: Ursidae) comprises
both extant and extinct species of bears, for which
the taxonomy is relatively uncontroversial. For this
group, we obtained a total of 172 complete or partial
mitochondrial genomes from GenBank (retrieved on
20 February, 2017) and extracted the 12 protein-coding
genes (excluding ND6). The sloth bear (Melursus ursinus)
was added as an outgroup to allow estimation of a
rooted tree. After removing duplicate sequences and/or
sequences containing large proportions of missing data,
we aligned the sequences while maintaining the reading
frames. Our dataset then comprised concatenated
sequences of the 12 protein-coding genes from 89 taxa
(Supplementary Appendix S4 available on Dryad).
We inferred the gene tree using maximum likelihood
in RAxML, with a separate GTR+G+I substitution
model applied to each gene. We ran rapid full analyses
with 1000 bootstrap replicates. After rooting the tree and
removing the outgroup sequence from the sloth bear, we
used the inferred tree for species delimitation by GMYC,
bPTP-h, bPTP-ML, and PTP-h. For BPP, the maximum-
likelihood tree was simply treated as the guide tree for
species delimitation with diffuse gamma priors s ~
G(1,500) and 0~G(1,100).
Bees.—We tested the effects of locus number and
sample size on species delimitation using sequence data
from bees. This is a group of insects with important
pollination services, but for which species diversity is
relatively unclear. To test the impact of the number
of loci, we downloaded a total of 38 complete or
partial mitochondrial genomes of apid bees (Apidae;
Hymenoptera: Apoidea) from GenBank (retrieved on
23 May, 2017). After removing duplicates and aligning
the sequences, we used three datasets comprising 20
sequences of COI, 20 concatenated sequences of COI
and CYTB, and 18 concatenated sequences of ATP6,
COI, COII, COIII, CYTB, and ND1. Data are available in
Supplementary Appendix S5 available on Dryad.
To test the impact of sample size, we downloaded
sequences of the canonical barcode region (i.e., the
5’ terminus of the COI gene) from the mason bees
of the genus Osmia (Apoidea: Megachilidae). After
deleting sequences containing large proportions of
missing data, pruning non-unique sequences, aligning
the sequences, and removing species represented by
fewer than ﬁve sequences, we were left with 69
sequences. In terms of species annotations, we randomly
deleted some sequences to obtain two additional
datasets: one comprising two sequences per species,
and another comprising a single sequence per species
(Supplementary Appendix S6 available on Dryad).
To allow the position of the root to be inferred,
corresponding
genes
or
regions
from
Megachile
sculpturalis (GenBank accession NC_028017) and/or
Megachile strupigera (GenBank accession KT346366) were
used as the outgroup for both apid bees and mason bees
(Hedtke et al. 2013). Species delimitations with GMYC,
bPTP-ML, and BPP were implemented in a similar
manner to our analyses of bear sequences. For our BPP
analyses, the maximum-likelihood tree inferred from
the 69 sequences was used as the guide tree for the
other two datasets of mason bees. To achieve MCMC
convergence, we drew samples from 5×106 MCMC
steps rather than the 106 steps used in our other BPP
analyses.
RESULTS
Simulation Scenario I: One Species
For the null case in which sequences were sampled
from a single species, BPP generally yielded the correct
delimitation with high posterior probabilities (median
=0.99 and mean =0.93) for the one-species model
(P1), across various parameter combinations (Table 2;
Supplementary Appendix S7 available on Dryad). In
some instances, however, P1 has extremely low values
(min.=0.00),whereasposteriorprobabilitiesforthetwo-
species model (P2) are relatively high. To avoid species
inﬂation (Carstens et al. 2013), we consider that BPP
supports the existence of two species only if P2 >0.95
(Zhang et al. 2011). Therefore, the false-positive error rate
is 1.73% for BPP, but is high for both GMYC and PTP
(Tables 2 and 3; Supplementary Appendix S7 available
on Dryad).
After excluding NAs, all of the delimitations by GMYC
and PTP yielded false positives, indicating that both
oversplit species under our null simulation scenario.
However, they delimited varying numbers of OTUs.
Given the available delimitations, GMYC inferred fewer
OTUs (median =2 and mean =3.38) than PTP across all
of the relevant simulation conditions. Among the three
strategies of PTP, bPTP-h and PTP-h gave rise to smaller
maximum numbers of delimited OTUs than did bPTP-
ML, but bPTP-ML yielded fewer OTUs overall (median
=5 and mean =8.44).
Simulation Scenario II: Two Species
With

priors
in
BPP,
P2
for

two-
species delimitation model approaches 1.00 under most
conditions, yielding an average false-negative error rate

Note: Posterior probabilities for correct delimitation models are given for the results from BPP: P1 of the
one-species model for Scenario I; P2 of the two-species model for Scenarios II and III; P7 of the ﬁve-species
model for Scenario IV; and P5 of the four-species model for Scenario V. The numbers of delimited OTUs
for each simulated species are reported for both GMYC and PTP.

times (t=106 or 107), P2 is greater than 0.95 for almost
all population sizes. When t=105, the P2 values show
complex patterns: with smaller population sizes (N =104
and 105), P2 is below 0.95 especially for smaller sample
sizes (n=1 and 2), but tends to increase with number
of loci l; with a larger population size (N =106), P2 ﬁrst
decreases, then approaches 1.00 with larger values of
n and l.
The results from our BPP analyses of supplementary
(N, t) combinations (103, 106) are similar to those from
(104, 107). Results from (107, 106) are broadly consistent
with those from (106, 105), except for large values of n
and l and some failures in MCMC convergence. Given
that MCMC convergence was generally good in our
BPP delimitations, here we only note the cases in which
MCMC convergence was not achieved. With sample
size n=50 and (N, t) as (106, 105), P2 values are 1.00
across different values of l (Supplementary Appendix
S8 available on Dryad).
The number of delimited OTUs for each simulated
species (median =1 and mean =1.71) gives the
impression that GMYC might correctly delimit species
under this scenario (Table 2). However, GMYC actually
produced a low rate of correct delimitations (21.89%)
with no false negatives. False positives (52.61%) and
complex false positives (13.06%) occurred quite often,
with the latter limited to certain combinations of (N,
t) (Fig. 4 and Table 3). GMYC failed to yield a species
delimitation with small sample size n and/or number
of loci l, and encountered computing errors with some
(N, t) combinations. Although correct delimitations
generally accompany false positives, the percentage of
the latter is signiﬁcantly higher than that of the former
(P<10−3, non-parametric paired Wilcoxon test). The test
also reveals that larger numbers of loci did not improve
the chance of obtaining correct delimitations (P>0.05 for
l comparisons of 1~2, 1~5, 1~10, and 1~20), but larger
samples sizes did (P<10−3 for n comparisons 2~5, 2~10,
and 2~20). In contrast, analyzing larger numbers of loci
resulted in more false-positive errors, whereas sample
size did not have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on this error rate.
PTP-h produced many NA results (54.06%), with
most due to unclear species delimitations. However,
correct delimitations dominate the remaining available
results (Table 3; Supplementary Appendix S9 available

on Dryad). The other two methods, bPTP-h and bPTP-
ML, performed similarly to each other, with far fewer
NA results. However, bPTP-h oversplit species more
frequently (Table 3; Supplementary Appendix S10
available on Dryad). Because we penalize species
overestimation more greatly than underestimation,
we only provide the detailed results from bPTP-ML
here (Fig. 5). This method produced correct species
delimitations in the majority of cases (60.33%; Table 3).
However, it had variable rates of success under different
conditions, as also shown by the larger standard
deviation (3.17) of the numbers of delimited OTUs
for each simulated species (Table 2). Under some
conditions (e.g., the combination of N =104 and t=107),
the performance of bPTP-ML generally increases with
number of loci l and sample size n. It did not produce
any false negatives, whereas false positives mainly occur
in the (N, t) combinations of (105, 105) and (106, 106).
Complex false positives tend to dominate the results
when N =106 and t=105.
We

different
whether
we
performed
simulations using makesamples or SimPhy. Population
growth also had no signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the

of
the
species-delimitation
methods.
However, having one species of population size larger
than that of the other species (N =104) led to false
positives dominating the delimitations by GMYC and
bPTP-ML. Both unbalanced sampling and mutation
rate heterogeneity at different levels were found to have
small effects on the performance of these methods (see
Supplementary Appendix S2 available on Dryad for
details).
Simulation Scenario III: Two Species with Ongoing Gene
Flow
With the basic settings informed by Scenario II
(population size N =104, divergence time t=106, and
sample size n=10) and with reference to delimitation
results under these conditions in Scenario II, we found
that varying degrees of gene ﬂow did inﬂuence the
performanceofthesemethods.BPPidentiﬁedthecorrect
species delimitation when the migration rate was very
low (Mij =0.1) (Supplementary Appendix S11 available
on Dryad). When Mij =1,P2 approaches 1.00 only with
larger numbers of loci. For higher migration rates, nearly
all P2 values approach 0.00, indicating the presence of
false negatives.
Compared with BPP, both GMYC and bPTP-ML
appear to be more sensitive to the presence of gene
ﬂow. A large proportion of false positives was produced
by GMYC when Mij =0.1, and complex false positives
dominate the available results of GMYC when Mij ≥1.

Of the different methods in PTP, we only consider bPTP-
MLherebecauseofitssuperiorperformanceinScenarios
I and II. It produced a variety of results, including
correct delimitations, when Mij =0.1 and 1. For higher
migration rates, however, bPTP-ML tended to produce
complex false positives. Neither GMYC nor bPTP-ML
yielded false negatives under this scenario. The numbers
of delimited OTUs for each simulated species in this
scenario are also higher than those in Scenario II for both
GMYC and bPTP-ML (Table 2).
Simulation Scenario IV: Five Species
We use the values of the speciation rates, which
controlled the relative depths of the internal nodes in
our simulated trees, to refer to the ﬁve chronograms in
this scenario (Supplementary Appendix S3 available
on
Dryad).
When
speciation
rate
r≤10−6
(i.e.,
relatively
deep
speciation
events),
BPP
generally
obtained the correct species delimitation model with
posterior probabilities (P7) approaching 1.00 (Fig. 6a;
Supplementary Appendix S12 available on Dryad). This
model is denoted as “1111”, where the numbers “1”
indicate the correct resolutions of (A,B) from (D,(C,E)), A
from B, D from (C,E), and C from E, respectively. Failure
to identify each of these distinctions is denoted by “0”.
When r=10−5 (i.e., shallow speciation events), posterior
probabilities are spread across all delimitation models
except 0000, given small numbers of loci (i.e., l=1 or 2);
for larger l, however, P7 always approaches 1.00.
GMYC yielded the correct delimitation under some
circumstances in the ﬁve-species scenario (Fig. 6b;
Supplementary Appendix S12 available on Dryad).
When r≤10−6, GMYC correctly delimited all of the
species pairs, though with a few false negatives
and false positives. When r=10−5 and with smaller
l, it mainly produced false negatives for the four
species pairs along the two basal branches, but correct
delimitations for the other six pairs. For r=10−5 and
large l, some false positives appear together with
correct delimitations for all ten species pairs, making
GMYC delimitations complicated. Conversely, bPTP-
ML produced results with some clear patterns (Fig. 6c;
Supplementary Appendix S12 available on Dryad).
When r=10−5, it typically yielded false negatives and
correct delimitations for the above four species pairs and
the six species pairs, respectively. When r=10−6 together
with l=1 and l=2, some false negatives accompany
correct delimitations. Under the remaining conditions,
bPTP-ML almost always yielded correct delimitations.
Numbers of delimited OTUs for GMYC and bPTP-ML
have lower mean and median values (Table 2), but these
can mask the presence of false negatives.

(the blue and red colors are only shown in online version). Darker colors indicate stronger relationships. Delimitation models are denoted by
the character “m” and numbers along the diagonal, such as “m111” for delimitation model 111.
Simulation Scenario V: Four Species with Ongoing Gene
Flow between Adjacent Species
For our scenario with four species experiencing
ongoing gene ﬂow between geographically adjacent
species, BPP yielded posterior probabilities similar to
those from Scenario III (Supplementary Appendix S13
available on Dryad). Only with a low migration rate
(Mij ≤1; and Mij =1 with larger l) were high probabilities
obtained for the correct delimitation model. This model
is referred to as “111”, where the numbers “1” denote
correct resolutions of (A,B) from (C,D), A from B, and
C from D, respectively. Failure to identify each of these
distinctions is denoted by “0”. Otherwise, the model 000
has a high posterior probability (Fig. 6d), though it is
relatively low when Mij =10.
As with Scenario III, GMYC and bPTP-ML show
stronger sensitivity to the presence of gene ﬂow, but they
both yielded a few false negatives with every level of
gene ﬂow (Tables 2 and 3; Supplementary Appendix S13
available on Dryad). A variety of results containing some
correct delimitations (mainly with smaller numbers
of loci) and many false positives were obtained for
GMYC when Mij =0.1 and for bPTP-ML when Mij ≤
1. Otherwise, complex false positives dominate their
delimitations.
Separate analyses of the four species pairs from
Scenario V (Supplementary Appendix S14 available on
Dryad) show that when Mij =1, P2 values from BPP for
(A, C) and (A, D) are higher than those for (A, B) and
(B, C). Even with a very high migration rate (Mij =10),

loci l=10 and l=20. For bPTP-ML, correct delimitations
for (A, C) and (A, D) were obtained more frequently
than those for (A, B) and (B, C) when Mij =0.1. For
GMYC, which produced limited correct delimitations,
there are no clear differences in the numbers of correct
delimitations among the four species pairs. However, for
Mij =1, more false positives were produced for (A, C)
and (A, D), whereas complex false positives dominate
the results from (A, B) and (B, C). For all three species-
delimitation methods, delimitation differences among
the species pairs, indicating the effects of geographic
distance, become negligible when the migration rate
is very small or very large (as appropriate for each
method).
Species Delimitation in Bears
The
maximum-likelihood
estimate
of
the
mitochondrial tree of Ursus shows that the brown
bear (U. arctos) is paraphyletic with respect to the
polar bear (U. maritimus) (Fig. 7). The sequences from
the cave bear (U. spelaeus) are also not monophyletic,
but this is corrected with the recent designation of
sequence NC_011112 as belonging to U. ingressus (Stiller
et al. 2014). With the species annotation and reciprocal
monophyly as references, a guide tree comprising 10
taxa (Fig. 7) aided BPP in identifying 9 OTUs with a
posterior probability of 0.84. The three strategies in PTP,
bPTP-ML, bPTP-h, and PTP-h, estimated 17, 22, and
20 OTUs, respectively. GMYC analysis using a single
threshold identiﬁed the presence of 20 OTUs, matching
the result obtained using PTP-h.

Species Delimitation in Bees
Species included in our datasets account for a small
portion of the described species of apid bees and
mason bees, so we do not focus on the inferred
relationships here. We tested the effects of the number
of loci l and sample size n on the performance of
BPP, GMYC, and bPTP-ML with the available species
annotations. For Apidae (Supplementary Appendix S15
available on Dryad), our duplicate BPP analyses with
5×106 MCMC steps failed to converge when l=6,
resulting in posterior probabilities approaching 1.00
for two different delimitation models. One of these
models, along with the species delimitations with the
highest posterior probabilities when l=1 and l=2, are
consistent with the species annotations. Both GMYC
and bPTP-ML produced estimates congruent with the
species annotations, except that GMYC delineated two
subspecies of Apis mellifera from other subspecies when
l=2.
For
Osmia
bees
(Supplementary
Appendix
S16
available on Dryad), when n=1, GMYC and bPTP-ML
mixed the annotated species to varying degrees. When
n=2, the two methods generally identiﬁed the annotated
species, but with one more OTU for some species.
When n≥5, the methods delimited more OTUs for the
annotated species. Delimitations from our BPP analyses
are consistent with the 10 Osmia species whenever n=1,
2, or ≥5.
DISCUSSION
Performance of Species-Delimitation Methods
We have presented a comprehensive comparison
of the performance of three widely used molecular
species-delimitation methods, based on ﬁve different
simulation scenarios. The Bayesian coalescent method
in BPP, designed for multiple loci, was found to
yield high posterior probabilities for correct species
delimitations under a variety of conditions. It was
relatively robust to the inﬂuence of unequal population
sizes, population growth, unbalanced sampling, and
mutation rate heterogeneity. Some of these ﬁndings are
consistent with those of previous studies (e.g., Zhang et
al. 2011; Barley et al. 2018). However, we note that our
use of BPP was carried out under favorable conditions.
For example, we used diffuse gamma priors that were
compatible with the population sizes and divergence
times in our simulations (Leaché and Fujita 2010; Yang
2015). We also speciﬁed the true species tree as the guide
tree, although the species tree can be jointly estimated
with species delimitation by BPP or independently
inferred by BPP or other software such as *BEAST
(Heled and Drummond 2010; Yang and Rannala 2014;
Caviedes-Solis et al. 2015; Yang 2015).
We conﬁrmed that BPP encountered problems when
the migration rate between species was relatively high
(Mij >1), and that its delimitation efﬁcacy was somewhat
affected by geographic distance (Zhang et al. 2011). These
results are not surprising, given the assumption of BPP
that no gene ﬂow exists between species. We also found
that when the ratio of population size to divergence time
(N/t) was relatively high, BPP had a high probability
of underestimating the number of species, although
this could potentially be overcome by analyzing larger
numbers of loci and/or using larger samples. Therefore,
recently diverged species (as shown by our Scenarios II
and IV) pose a challenge to BPP, especially when they
have larger population sizes. This outcome is consistent
with a previous ﬁnding that more loci are needed
when analyzing species that have a shallow evolutionary
history (Hime et al. 2016).
We obtained different species delimitations across
the three PTP strategies and even the newly developed
multi-rate PTP method, which did not perform better
than bPTP-ML according to our evaluation criteria
(resultsnotshown).However,ourfocusisoncomparison
of GMYC, PTP, and BPP. In contrast with BPP, the ﬁrst
two methods aim to delimit species efﬁciently with data
from a single locus, but are increasingly being applied to
multilocusdatasets.However,ourresultshighlightsome
differences between the methods. First, unlike the single-
threshold GMYC, the best PTP strategy bPTP-ML did not
encounter computing errors. Second, bPTP-ML correctly
delimited species in Scenario II more frequently than did
GMYC, contributing to the better overall performance
of bPTP-ML compared with GMYC. Third, larger l and
n generally enhanced correct delimitations in bPTP-
ML, whereas the effect of the former was more modest
for GMYC. Fourth, where species were not delimited
correctly, the results often differed between GMYC and
bPTP-ML. Last, the numbers of delimited OTUs for
simulated species indicate that GMYC and PTP can infer
different numbers of OTUs in practice.
There
are
also
considerable
similarities
in
the
performance of GMYC and bPTP-ML. Both methods
were sensitive to the ratio N/t. Large values of N/t led
to complex false positives involving polyphyletic species
and false positives involving oversplitting (e.g., Scenario
II). Both GMYC and bPTP-ML were also very sensitive
to ongoing gene ﬂow, with negative impacts seen even
with very low levels of gene ﬂow. Further, both were
generally robust to the effects of potential confounding
factors (e.g., unbalanced sampling and mutation rate
heterogeneity), but to a lesser extent than BPP overall
(especially to differing population sizes; Supplementary
Appendix S2 available on Dryad). Additionally, our
results support the suggestion that GMYC should not
be used when the dataset consists of very few putative
species, and we extend this suggestion to include bPTP-
ML. This is because of the imbalance between speciation
and coalescence (Talavera et al. 2013; Dellicour and Flot
2015), which poses a challenge to identifying transition
points between inter- and intraspeciﬁc processes. In our
results, problems appeared in the forms of no correct
delimitations (Scenario I), no false negatives (Scenario
II, Scenario III, and individual pairs from Scenario V),
and even computing errors in GMYC.

Onthewhole,ourresultsindicatethatbothGMYCand
bPTP-ML are able to perform well in the absence of gene
ﬂow between species; the latter method tends to perform
better overall, although in some cases it produced larger
numbers of inferred OTUs. Nevertheless, GMYC and
bPTP-ML have a number of important shortcomings.
First,
they
need
gene
trees
to
be
speciﬁed
and
they treat these as being equivalent to species trees.
This assumption is problematic when there is strong
discordance between the gene trees and the species
tree (Degnan and Rosenberg 2006, 2009).Consequently,
concatenation of multiple loci requires caution when
using methods designed to analyze single-locus data.
Second, when N/t was relatively high, the performance
of both GMYC and bPTP-ML was poor regardless of
the number of loci or the sample size. Third, GMYC
and bPTP-ML rely on the accuracy of the input trees,
and upstream errors can result in misleading species
delimitations (Tang et al. 2014). GMYC seems to be
generally robust to the choice of method used to infer
the ultrametric input tree (Talavera et al. 2013; da Cruz
and Weksler 2018), but this result is in contrast with the
known sensitivity of node-time estimates to the choice
of clock model and tree prior (e.g., Duchêne et al. 2014).
Factors Affecting Molecular Species Delimitation
The combination of population size N and divergence
time t has differing impacts on the three species-
delimitation methods. When the ratio N/t was relatively
high for two species, BPP tended to produce false-
negative errors. To obtain a correct species delimitation
with a small number of loci and small sample size
(e.g., 2 for both), the maximum of the ratio N/t for
BPP analyses should be around 1 (Fig. 3). With higher
N/t, GMYC and bPTP-ML increasingly produced false
positives and complex false positives in Scenario II.
With shallow speciation events in Scenario IV, GMYC
mainly yielded false negatives with false positives for
closely related species, whereas bPTP-ML increased the
number of false negatives. These results demonstrate
the important inﬂuence of incomplete lineage sorting on
speciesdelimitation,whichbecomesmoreprobablewith
higher N/t.
There is growing use of multi-locus datasets for
molecular species delimitation, but this often involves
a trade-off between the number of loci and sample
size for each species (Fujisawa and Barraclough 2013;
Hime et al. 2016). We investigated the possible effects
of this trade-off, particularly in Scenario II of our
simulations, ﬁnding that the effects were outweighed
by those of the population size and divergence time.
This was previously demonstrated for GMYC (Fujisawa
and Barraclough 2013), but we have found that it also
holds true for BPP and bPTP-ML. However, the effects
of the number of loci l and sample size n cannot be
negligible. Although both l and n appeared to have no
impact with lower N/t (somewhat consistent with the
results of Yang and Rannala 2017), increasing both l and
n improved correct delimitations of BPP with higher
N/t (Figs. 3 and 6a). Under some conditions in Scenario
II, increasing l and/or n improved the performance of
bPTP-ML and GMYC.
Our concatenations of larger numbers of loci generally
did not have negative effects on the performance of
bPTP-ML and GMYC, indicating that the impacts of
violating the assumption of gene-tree discordance are
modest. However, the situation might be considerably
more complex for real data. The performance of BPP
with concatenations of 20 loci was equal to or worse than
that with single locus (results not shown), suggesting
that concatenating independent loci can have a negative
impact on methods that have been designed to analyze
multiple loci.
The presence of gene ﬂow had negative impacts
on
the
three
methods
examined
in
our
study,
particularly on GMYC and bPTP-ML. These two
methods were also substantially affected by differing
population
sizes
resulting
in
higher
N/t,
along
with the number of putative species. In contrast,
unbalanced
sampling,
population
growth,
and

methods (Supplementary Appendix S2 available on

Species Delimitation, Population Delimitation,
or a Mosaic?
Our
simulation
study
has
shed
light
on
the
performance of species-delimitation methods across a
range of speciation scenarios, but its implications apply
equally to studies of highly structured populations
(Sukumaran and Knowles 2017). For example, BPP
has been variously used to delimit populations (e.g.,
Potter et al. 2016), to delimit species (e.g., Mason et
al. 2016), to delimit populations with the potential to
elevate them to species (e.g., Oliveira et al. 2015), and
to delimit evolving lineages within and across species
(e.g., Moritz et al. 2018). Our speciation scenarios can
be interpreted as being analogous to speciﬁc models
of population structure. For example, two species with
unequal population sizes (Supplementary Appendix S2
available on Dryad) can be treated as a simple case
of the continent-island model without migration. Our
simulation Scenario V is a one-dimensional stepping-
stone model of population structure.
The
delimited
OTUs
can
represent
species,
populations,
or
even
a
mosaic
of
species
and
populations. In this study, we have simply treated
speciation
events
as
being
instantaneous,
while
assuming Wright–Fisher panmixia for each species.
In contrast, both the protracted speciation model
and the viewpoint that a species is a separately
evolving metapopulation lineage (de Queiroz 2007)
treat speciation as an extended process. However,
these two treatments are not strictly contradictory. Our
modelling of speciation as an instantaneous event can

be interpreted as the initiation of speciation (i.e., lineage
separation), with the delimited OTUs then representing
populations or a mosaic of species and populations. If
the extended process is relatively short and the newly
formed species do not have pronounced structure, then
species divergence is effectively an instantaneous event.
If there is any continuation of gene ﬂow, the effects are
captured in our Scenarios III and V.
The results of molecular species delimitation should
be interpreted alongside other lines of evidence, such
as comparative morphology, population genetics, and
ecology(SukumaranandKnowles2017).Theimportance
of using such an integrative approach to taxonomy is
underscored by our ﬁnding that PTP and GMYC yielded
high rates of false positives and complex false positives
in some circumstances. If interpreted naively, the results
of these analyses would lead to an artiﬁcial inﬂation in
the number of species.
Implications of Case Studies
Our case studies, based on species of bears and bees,
conﬁrmed some of the ﬁndings from our simulation
study. These included differences in the performance
of the three species-delimitation methods, along with
the modest effects of increasing the number of loci and
sample size. To interpret these results, we referred to
the species annotations accompanying the sequence data
from bears and bees, most of which are attributed to
traditional morphological taxonomy.
Like the species annotations in our cases, additional
information from morphological characters, behavioral
traits, and geographic distributions would be needed to
provide informed staring points for species delimitation.
Accordingly, molecular species delimitation is either
implicitly or explicitly carried out as part of an
integrative taxonomy approach (Dayrat 2005; Will et
al. 2005). In terms of other lines of evidence as
above, the informed starting points provide important
background for interpreting the presence of population
structure.
Our analysis of mitochondrial genomes from bears
enhances
our
understanding
of
these
vulnerable,
endangered, or extinct animals. For example, our
results point to various delimitations of the brown
bear, a species that has been the subject of numerous
mitochondrial
studies
(Davison
et
al.
2011).
Its
mitochondrial paraphyly with respect to the polar bear
has been recognized as an instance of introgression due
to past hybridization between the two species (Hailer et
al. 2012).
Compared with bears, many bee species remain
undescribed, despite their ecological and economic
importance. Currently, pollinator bees fundamental
to agricultural productivity are declining towards
extinction (Ollerton et al. 2014; Carswell 2015). Our
delimitation
results
are
broadly
consistent
with
the species annotations, indicating that molecular
species delimitation complements rather than replaces
the
traditional
taxonomy.
With
molecular
species
delimitation, the ﬁrst step to protecting species diversity
of bees can be accelerated.
CONCLUSIONS
We have compared the performance of three widely
used methods of species-delimitation across a range of
simulation scenarios and evolutionary parameters. Our
results have drawn attention to the better accuracy and
robustness of the Bayesian coalescent method in BPP,
along with the performance of the GMYC model and
the PTP model under a range of conditions. All three
methods are negatively inﬂuenced by gene ﬂow and are
sensitive to the ratio of population size to divergence
time, reﬂecting the important impact of incomplete
lineage sorting on species delimitation. Unexpectedly,
we found only a modest beneﬁt in increasing the
number of loci and the sample size per species. Future
studies of molecular species delimitation, particularly
focusing on a range of empirical datasets, will provide
further insights into the relative impacts of different
confounding factors. With a greater understanding of
the behavior of molecular species-delimitation methods,
genetic data will increasingly contribute to integrative
taxonomy and other areas of biological research.
