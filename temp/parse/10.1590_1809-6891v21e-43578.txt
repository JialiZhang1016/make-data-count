Abstract:
The effects of supplement doses (0, 1, 2 and 3 kg ha-1 day-1) and 
grazing periods (1, 28, 59, 89 and 103 days) on the B. decumbens 
cv. Basilisk structure and cattle production in deferred 
pastures were evaluated. The design was a randomised 
complete block design with two replications. The sward height 
and the total forage and stem masses decreased with grazing 
period. The crude protein (8.12%) and in vitro organic matter 
digestibility (52.74%) were not affected by grazing period. The 
fibre content in neutral and acid detergent increased linearly 
with the grazing period. The average daily gain of cattle ranged 
from 0.419 to 1.019 kg animal-1 day-1; the stocking rate ranged 
from 2.7 to 3.9 animal unit ha-1; and the average gain per area 
ranged from 2.7 to 7.9 kg ha-1 day-1, with the maximum values 
obtained with the highest dose of concentrate. Concentrate 
supplementation increases cattle production in deferred 
pastures. During the use of deferred pasture in winter there 
are decreases in the quantity and quality of forage, as well as 
limitations in its structure.

Introduction
Although pastures are an important source of food in Brazil, seasonal forage production 
results in limited animal performance throughout the year. Therefore, it is essential to 
provide forage during the scarcity period, through cutting grass, hay, silage and deferred 
pasture, among others. Of these options, deferred pasture is interesting because of the 
practicality of execution and relatively lower cost.
In deferred pastures, cattle express moderate performance or maintain body weight. 
However, higher animal performance can be obtained when adequate deferral actions 
are associated with supplementation(1). Supplementation can be used to correct forage 
nutritional deficiencies, increase pasture support capacity, enhance weight gain, 
reduce slaughter age, assist in pasture management and provide additives or growth 
promoters(2).
To increase the efficiency of concentrated supplementation, forage availability and 
deferred pasture structure should not limit animal consumption(1). These conditions 
can be obtained by proper pasture management before the deferment period. In this 
sense, it is recommended that Brachiaria decumbens cv. Basilisk pastures should be 
deferred in April(3), with an initial height of 20 cm(4), for use in early July. These conditions 
would ensure the formation of the most adequate pasture structure, both in quantity 
and quality.
It is also noteworthy that forage availability decreases and the canopy structure 
becomes limited during the grazing period, due to the phenological alteration of the 
plants and the effect of grazing itself(5). These changes in deferred pasture structure in 
the grazing period affect ingestive behaviour and consequently, animal performance. 
In this sense, understanding of the plant–animal interface during the grazing period, 
under conditions of concentrate supplementation, may help in the recommendation of 
more efficient management practices in deferred pastures. Thus, this work proposed to 
evaluate the structural characteristics and nutritional value of the pasture, as well as the 
performance of supplemented animals in deferred pastures with Brachiaria decumbens 
cv. Basilisk.
Material and methods
This work was conducted from January to October 2011, in an area of the Department of 
Animal Science of the Federal University of Viçosa, Viçosa, MG (20º 45’ south latitude, 42º 
51’ west longitude and 651 m altitude). The climate of Viçosa(6) is Cwa type, subtropical,

with mild and dry winters and rainy summers. The average annual temperature is 19 ºC 
and the average annual rainfall is 1,340 mm. Climatic data from the experimental period 
were recorded at the Federal University of Viçosa Meteorological Station, located 500 m 
from the experimental area (Figure 1).
The experimental area used was an area of pasture with Brachiaria decumbens Stapf. 
cv. Basilisk (signalgrass) established in 1997 and subdivided into eight paddocks 
(experimental units), with an area ranging from 0.25 to 0.39 ha. The soil of the 
experimental area was classified as red–yellow latosol, of clay texture and with medium 
wavy relief(7).
In January 2011, prior to the implementation of the experiment, soil samples were 
taken from a 0–20 cm deep layer to analyse the fertility level in each experimental 
unit. According to the results of the chemical analysis, the soil presented, on average, 
the following characteristics: pH in H2O: 5.00; P (Mehlich-1): 4.00 mg dm-3 and K: 106.80 
mg dm-3; Ca2
+: 1.67 cmolc dm-3; Mg2
+: 0.52 cmolc dm-3; Al3
+: 0.30 cmolc dm-3 (1 mol KCl 
L-1); base saturation: 30.5%. Based on the results of the analysis of the soil samples, 
150 kg ha-1 of the formulated 20-05-20 (N-P2O5-K2O), divided into three applications, 
was applied in January, February and March 2011(8). From January to April 2011, the 
pastures were managed with continuous stocking of cattle and a variable stocking rate, 
to maintain the average height at 20 cm(9). In April 2011, the pastures were deferred, 
with an initial height of 20 cm(4,10), remaining deferred until July 2011, when the grazing 
period began.
Four doses of concentrated supplement were evaluated (0, 1, 2 and 3 kg animal-1

day-1, which corresponded to 0, 0.45, 0.86 and 1.34% of the average body weight of the 
animals, respectively and provided to the animals throughout the period of deferred 
pasture use (07/04/2011 to 10/15/2011). Additionally, the structural characteristics of the 
deferred pastures were evaluated on five days during the grazing period: 07/04/2011, 
07/31/2011, 08/31/2011, 09/30/2011 and 10/15/2011. These consisted of the 1st, 28th, 
59th, 89th and 103th days of the grazing period, respectively. The experimental design 
was a randomised complete block with two replications. The criterion for determining 
the blocks was the relief of the experimental area.
During the use of the deferred pastures (07/04/2011 to 10/15/2011), the signalgrass was 
managed in continuous stocking with an initial fixed stocking rate of 2.2 animal units 
(AU) ha-1, keeping two animals per paddock. The AU corresponded to 450 kg of animal 
body weight. Sixteen Holstein x Zebu crossbred steers, non-castrated, with an average 
initial weight of 190 kg were used. These animals remained in the eight paddocks 
during the 103 days of the grazing period, during which there was no adjustment of the 
stocking rate in the paddocks. The ingredient compositions of the supplements were: 
1 kg animal-1 day-1 (68% cornmeal, 19% soybean meal, 10% mineral salt and 3% urea); 
2 kg animal-1 day-1 (73% cornmeal, 19% soybean meal, 5% mineral salt and 3% urea); 
and 3 kg animal-1 day-1 (74.7% cornmeal, 19% soybean meal, 3.3% mineral salt and 3% 
urea). The cattle began to receive supplementation seven days before the beginning of 
grazing for adaptation. They also received mineral salt ad libitum.
All evaluations of deferred pastures occurred on the 1st, 28th, 59th, 89th and 103th days 
of the grazing period. Pasture and extended plant heights were measured at 50 points 
per paddock, followed up by a zigzag walk. For pasture height measurements, a graded 
ruler was used, considering the distance between the ground level and the forage leaf 
horizon in the pasture. The extended plant height was measured by extending the tillers 
vertically and noting the distance between the ground level and the apex of the tillers. 
The falling index was estimated by the quotient between the extended plant height and 
the pasture height(4).
Forage mass was estimated at three sites representative of the average pasture height 
per experimental unit. At each sampling site, the tillers contained within a 0.40 m side 
(0.16 m²) rebar frame were harvested at ground level. In the laboratory, the samples 
were weighed and subdivided into two subsamples. One of these was weighed, 
wrapped in a paper bag and placed in a 65 °C forced air oven for 72 h, when it was 
reweighed. The other subsample was manually separated into live leaf blade, live 
stem, dead leaf blade and dead stem. Subsequently, each component was weighed 
and dried in a forced air oven at 65 °C for 72 h and reweighed. It was thus possible to 
estimate live forage (live leaf blade + live stem), dead forage (dead leaf blade + dead 
stem) and total forage mass (sum of all morphological components of available forage), 
expressed in kg ha-1 of dry matter (DM). The volumetric density of available forage and 
morphological components (kg cm-1 ha-1 of DM) were estimated by dividing the forage 
and its morphological component masses, respectively, by pasture height.
Tiller population density was estimated at three sites representative of the average 
pasture height per experimental unit. At each location, the tillers within a 0.25 m (0.0625 
2020, Cienc. anim. bras, v.21, 1e-43578

m²) rebar frame were measured. 
A grazing simulation method was used to collect herbage samples in areas where the 
animal was grazing. A single properly trained evaluator collected the samples, observing 
the forage intake of all animals present in the experimental area. Subsequently, 
the samples were separated into live leaf blade, live stem and dead forage. These 
components were dried in a forced air oven at 65 ºC for 72 h and reweighed. These 
samples were also evaluated for dry mass, crude protein, neutral detergent and acid 
fibres, cellulose, lignin and silica(11).
Daily, the amounts of supplement provided in each paddock, as well as the leftovers from 
the previous day, were weighed. Thus, the absolute intake of supplement (kg animal-1 
day-1) was obtained by the difference between the daily supplement supplied and the 
respective leftovers from the previous day, divided by the number of animals (two) per 
experimental unit. The relative intake of supplement, as a percentage of animal body 
weight, was calculated by dividing the daily amount of supplement consumed by the 
average animal weight and then multiplied by 100. The average daily weight gain per 
animal was calculated by the weight difference of the animals, with fasting before 12h, 
at the beginning and at the end of the experiment. The average daily weight gain per 
unit area (kg ha-1 day-1) was calculated by the ratio between the accumulated weight gain 
of the animals in each paddock throughout the grazing period, by the respective area of 
the experimental unit. The result was divided by the evaluation period (103 days). The 
final stocking rate (AU ha-1) was calculated on the day of the final weighing by dividing 
the sum of the body weight of the animals in each paddock by the respective paddock 
area. For each paddock, forage offerings were calculated during the grazing period by 
dividing the forage mass (kg ha-1) by the animal weight (kg ha-1) in each paddock.
Data analyses were performed using the System for Statistical Analysis – SAEG, version 
8.1. The characteristics of animal productivity, measured only at the beginning and end 
of the experimental period, were subjected to analysis of variance and subsequently, 
regression, whose largest response surface model as a function of treatment means 
was: Ŷi = β0 + β1Si + β2Si2 + ei, where Ŷi = response variable; Si = supplement level; β0, 
β1, and β2 = parameters to be estimated; and ei = experimental error. For the other 
characteristics, measured on the 1st, 28th, 59th, 89th and 103th days of the grazing period, 
the variance analysis was performed and subsequently, the regression analysis, whose 
largest response surface model as a function of treatment mean was: Ŷi = β0 + β1Si + 
β2Si2 + β3Pi + β4Pi2 + β5SiPi + ei, where Ŷi = response variable; Si = supplement level; 
Pi = grazing period; β0, β1, β2, β3, β4 and β5 = parameters to be estimated; and ei = 
experimental error.
The fit level of the models was evaluated by the coefficient of determination and the 
significance of the regression coefficients, tested by the Tukey test, based on the variance 
analysis residues. The coefficients of variation for plot (supplement level) and subplot 
(grazing period) were calculated for each response variable. Analyses were performed 
at the 10% level of significance.

Results and discussion
Pasture height and plant extended height were influenced (P < 0.10) quadratically by 
the supplementation level and negatively and linearly by the grazing period. There 
was a reduction in pasture height and plant extended height when animals were 
supplemented with 1 kg animal-1 day-1, with a subsequent increase in values of these 
variables with levels of 2 and 3 kg animal-1 day-1 (Table 1).
There was an interaction (P < 0.10) between supplement level and grazing period for 
falling index (Table 1). This response can be best understood by analysing the extreme 
levels of the grazing period (1 and 103 days) of the secondary factor at each primary 
factor level (supplement level) (Figure 2). On the first day of grazing, the pasture tipping 
index decreased in pastures managed with 1 kg animal-1 day-1 of supplement, increasing 
with higher supplement levels. On the last day of grazing, the falling index was higher 
with the increase in supplement level.

Pasture structure and production of supplemented cattle in deferred signalgrass pasture
Santos, A. de D. et al.
During the use of deferred pasture in winter, plant growth is stalled or reduced 
considerably due to environmental conditions limiting growth, such as low light, 
temperature and rainfall (Figure 1). Therefore, the forage consumed by the animal is 
not compensated by grass growth, which results in a decrease in pasture and extended 
plant heights (Table 1). In addition, the grazing animal possibly increases the trampling 
of the grass, increasing plant falling (Figure 2). 
Regarding supplementation, the provision of 1 kg animal-1 day-1 may have corrected 
some forage nutrient deficiency(2), stimulating forage intake and reducing pasture and 
extended plant heights (Table 1) and the falling index (Figure 1) in relation to pasture 
without supplementation. When supplementation levels were 2 and 3 kg animal-1 day-1, 
the pasture intake may have been replaced by supplementation, which would justify 
the increase in pasture and plant extended heights, as well as in the falling index. The 
substitutive effect refers to the maintenance of the total energy intake level, through 
the increase in supplement intake and decrease in pasture forage intake(2).
Total forage and living stem mass decreased (P < 0.10) linearly with the grazing period. 
Live leaf blade mass and live leaf blade volumetric density were quadratically influenced 
(P < 0.10) by supplementation and by grazing period, respectively (Table 2). The dead 
leaf blade masses (1,071 kg ha-1 DM) and dead stem (1,870 kg ha-1 DM), the total forage 
density (275.8 kg ha-1 cm-1) of the stem (103.3 kg ha-1 cm-1), dead leaf blade (48.3 kg ha-1 
cm-1) and dead stem (96.6 kg ha-1 cm-1) and the ratios of live leaf blade/live stem (0.30) 
and live mass/dead mass (1.39) were not influenced (P > 0.10) by the factors studied. 
Live tiller population density increased linearly (P < 0.10) with supplement level and 
decreased (P < 0.10) with grazing period (Table 2).
2020, Cienc. anim. bras., v.21, e-43578
Pasture structure and production of supplemented cattle in deferred signalgrass pasture
Santos, A. de D. et al.
The decrease in live leaf blade mass at the 1.0 kg animal-1 day-1 level is consistent with 
the reduction in pasture and plant extended heights (Table 1), reinforcing the possible 
stimulation of pasture forage intake through supplementation. From 2 kg animal-1 
day-1, increases in live leaf blade mass, as well as pasture and plant extended heights 
and tiller population density may be related to the replacement of forage intake by 
supplementation. The concentrated supplement is more digestible and readily available 
for animal consumption compared to pasture. Thus, the intake of pasture is replaced 
by supplementation(2).
The quadratic influence of grazing period on mass and volumetric density of live leaf 
blade can be attributed to the adverse climate during winter, which reduced the values 
of these characteristics, with a subsequent increase at the end of the grazing period, 
due to better environmental conditions in October, notably temperature and rainfall 
(Figure 1), which indicate the beginning of pasture regrowth.
The reduction in total forage, live stem and live leaf blade masses, as well as the tiller 
population density during the grazing period (Table 2) is a result of the consumption 
of pasture by cattle. Grazing cattle preferentially consume live leaf(12,13), as it has better 
nutritional value(14), lower shear strength(15) and is easily accessible in the upper canopy 
stratum(16). This justifies the reduction of live leaf blade mass during the grazing period 
(Table 2). In turn, the stem is considered a physical limitation to the forage intake by the 
animals, since they can reduce the bit depth(17). Despite this, there was a decrease in live 
stem mass with the grazing period. Thus, this situation cannot be generalised to any 
grass and pasture management condition, because in the case of signalgrass, which 
has thin and flexible stems when green, there may be ingestion of these by animals 
during winter, when live leaf mass reduces in pasture. In addition, it is possible that 
some tillers died during the grazing period, which would also justify the reduction of 
live stem mass during this period.
The percentage of dead stem decreased linearly (P < 0.10) with the supplement level 
and increased linearly (P > 0.10) with the grazing period. The percentage of live leaf 
blade was quadratically influenced (P < 0.10) by the grazing period. The percentage of 
live stem decreased (P < 0.10) linearly with the grazing period, while the percentage of 
dead leaf blade varied (P < 0.10) quadratically with the supplement level and grazing 
period (Table 3).
The linear reduction of the live stem percentage and the quadratic response in the live 
leaf blade, as well as the linear increase of the dead stem and dead leaf blade percentages 
with the grazing period (Table 3), coincide with the reduction of the pasture height 
(Table 1), total forage masses, live leaf blade and live stem (Table 2) throughout the 
grazing period. As discussed earlier, when the animal consumes the deferred pasture, 
there is a greater selection of green forage, reducing the number of live leaf and stem 
and increasing the number of dead blades and stem. In addition, the use of deferred 
pastures in the Southeast region of Brazil occurs in winter, when there are climatic 
limitations to pasture growth, mainly due to low temperature, photoperiod and soil 
moisture (Figure 1), among others. Thus, the senescence and death processes of the 
plant are higher in this season(18), which also contributes to increasing the percentages 
2020, Cienc. anim. bras, v.21, 1e-43578

of leaf blade and stem deaths in the pastures. However, the onset of favourable climatic 
conditions (October) resulted in a stimulus for signalgrass regrowth, which led to a 
small reduction in the percentage of dead leaf blade and an increase in the percentage 
of live leaf blade during this period.
Regarding supplementation, pastures with levels of 0, 1, 2 and 3 kg animal-1 day-1 
concentrate showed, on average, 18.66, 14.85, 16.10 and 17.85%, respectively of dead 
leaf blade. As previously discussed, the reduction in the percentage of dead leaf blade at 
the level of 1 kg animal-1 day-1 may be related to a stimulation of pasture consumption. 
The percentage of dead leaf blade increasing from 2 kg animal-1 day-1 could be related 
to the replacement of pasture intake.
The percentage of live leaf blade of the simulated grazing sample increased linearly 
(P < 0.10) with the supplement dose and was quadratically influenced by the grazing 
period (Table 4). The increased availability of food through supplementation may have 
allowed the animal to select a higher quality diet, normally composed of more leaves. 
During the grazing period, the signalgrass used on days 1, 28, 59, 89 and 103, after 
deferral, presented, on average, 73.8, 39.7, 23.6, 11.9 and 36.4% of live leaf blade, 
respectively, certainly in response to the selection of this component by the animal, 
associated with reduced or no regrowth during winter. In October (favourable climate 
for regrowth), there was a greater participation of live leaves in the pasture and apparent 
forage consumption by cattle.
The percentage of dead forage in simulated grazing presented a quadratic response 
with the grazing period (P < 0.10) (Table 4). Probably, with the scarcity of live leaf blade 
during the winter grazing period, the animals started to consume more dead forage. At 
the end of the grazing period, in October, the beginning of pasture regrowth increased 
the availability of live leaf blade, which was consumed more, replacing dead forage. The 
percentage of live stem in simulated grazing (17.66%) was not affected (P > 0.10) by the 
evaluated factors.
2020, Cienc. anim. bras., v.21, e-43578
Pasture structure and production of supplemented cattle in deferred signalgrass pasture
Santos, A. de D. et al.
The live leaf blade percentage (37.08%) in the simulated grazing sample was much 
higher than that found in the pasture average (12.15%). Otherwise, the percentage 
of dead forage (16.86%) was lower in the simulated grazing sample in relation to the 
pasture average. These results highlight the ability of the grazing animal to select a 
higher quality diet in relation to the available pasture average.
Organic matter content (92.67%), crude protein (8.12%) and in vitro digestibility of organic 
matter (52.74%) were not influenced (P > 0.10) by grazing period and supplement level. 
On the other hand, neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre, lignin, cellulose and 
silica contents increased linearly (P < 0.10) with grazing period (Table 5). The structural 
characteristics of the pasture became unfavourable during the grazing period (Tables 
3, 4 and 5), which led to worsening of the nutritive value of the hand plucked herbage 
samples (Table 5).
2020, Cienc. anim. bras, v.21, 1e-43578
Pasture structure and production of supplemented cattle in deferred signalgrass pasture
Santos, A. de D. et al.
The structural characteristics of deferred pasture may make it less predisposing to animal 
consumption and performance during grazing. This fact was verified by the reduction of 
the forage and live leaf blade masses (Table 1) and the number of tillers (Table 2) and 
increase in dead forage mass (Table 2), which may have reduced the nutritive value of the 
pasture. This reduction in the nutritive value of the pasture was proven, for example, by 
the increase in acid detergent fibre and lignin contents (Table 5) in the pasture over the 
pasture period. During the grazing period, two processes contributed to the decrease 
of the nutritive value of the pasture: the senescence and the preferential intake of live 
leaf by the cattle.
Average daily gain (ADG), stocking rate (SR), livestock production by area (LPA), relative 
supplement intake (RSI) and absolute supplement intake increased linearly (P < 0.10) with 
supplement doses (Table 6). The ADG ranged from 0.419 to 1.019 kg animal-1 day-1; SR 
ranged from 2.7 to 3.9 AU ha-1; LPA ranged from 2.7 to 7.9 kg ha-1 day-1 and RSI ranged 
from 0.022 to 2.915%. Already the forage offer (OFFER) decreased (P < 010) linearly 
with supplement doses. Forage offer is the relationship between forage mass and 
animal weight. Therefore, animals that received a higher amount of supplementation 
presented higher performance and consequently, higher final weight, which may justify 
the reduction in forage offer. During the dry season, signalgrass paddocks in which 
animals had access to supplementation presented higher carrying capacity than those 
in which animals did not consume supplementation(19).
The animal performance results, mainly from the non-supplemented pasture, exceeded 
expectations, because if, during the dry season, average daily gains of null or moderate 
animals are expected, it is possible that the appropriate management of the deferred 
pasture, characterised by a short period of time deferral (90 days) and low height (20 cm) 
at the beginning of the deferment period, have enabled this level of performance. Fortes 
(2013)(20), working with Brachiaria brizantha cv. Piatã deferred in February in Tocantins, 
2020, Cienc. anim. bras., v.21, e-43578

also observed high performance of crossbred steers (0.287 kg animal-1 day-1) from June 
to August.
These results contradict the claim that deferred pastures result always in null or 
modest animal performance. Therefore, this concept should not be generalised, since 
management actions adopted in deferred pasture have a major effect on the nutritional 
value and structure of the pasture. Thus, appropriate management actions can and 
should be performed to improve plant and animal productivity in deferred pastures(1).
Conclusions
Supplementation with concentrate increases cattle production in deferred pastures. 
During the period of use of deferred pastures, in winter, there is a decrease in the 
amount of forage, as well as limitations in the structure of the pasture and the quality 
of the forage grazed by cattle.
