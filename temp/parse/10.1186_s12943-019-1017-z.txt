Abstract
Background: The biology function of antisense intronic long noncoding RNA (Ai-lncRNA) is still unknown. Meanwhile,
cancer patients with paclitaxel resistance have limited therapeutic options in the clinic. However, the potential
involvement of Ai-lncRNA in paclitaxel sensitivity remains unclear in human cancer.
Methods: Whole transcriptome sequencing of 33 breast specimens was performed to identify Ai-lncRNA EGOT. Next,
the role of EGOT in regulation of paclitaxel sensitivity was investigated. Moreover, the mechanism of EGOT enhancing
autophagy sensitizes paclitaxel cytotoxicity via upregulation of ITPR1 expression by RNA-RNA and RNA-protein
interactions was investigated in detail. Furthermore, upstream transcriptional regulation of EGOT expression was
also investigated by co-immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Finally, clinical breast specimens in
our cohort, TCGA and ICGC were applied to validate the role of EGOT in enhancing of paclitaxel sensitivity.
Results: EGOT enhances autophagosome accumulation via the up-regulation of ITPR1 expression, thereby sensitizing
cells to paclitaxel toxicity. Mechanistically, on one hand, EGOT upregulates ITPR1 levels via formation of a pre-ITPR1/
EGOT dsRNA that induces pre-ITPR1 accumulation to increase ITPR1 protein expression in cis. On the other hand, EGOT
recruits hnRNPH1 to enhance the alternative splicing of pre-ITPR1 in trans via two binding motifs in EGOT segment 2
(324–645 nucleotides) in exon 1. Moreover, EGOT is transcriptionally regulated by stress conditions. Finally,
EGOT expression enhances paclitaxel sensitivity via assessment of cancer specimens.
Conclusions: These findings broaden comprehensive understanding of the biology function of Ai-lncRNAs.
Proper regulation of EGOT may be a novel synergistic strategy for enhancing paclitaxel sensitivity in cancer
therapy.

Background
The microtubule-disrupting agent paclitaxel, a plant
alkaloid developed from the bark of the Pacific yew tree,
Taxus brevifolia, is a first-line chemotherapeutic agent
for solid tumors, such as lung, ovarian and breast cancer,
and contributes to substantial improvement in patient
survival [1]. However, clinical responses to paclitaxel
have shown variable sensitivity in cancer patients [2].
Thus, elucidation of the underlying mechanisms of pacli-
taxel sensitivity and identification of reliable biomarkers
that can predict the response to paclitaxel in human
cancer are urgently required.
Autophagy is a homeostatic process for degrading
cellular materials under cellular stress [3]. Accumulat-
ing evidence has shown that autophagy is involved in
modulating paclitaxel sensitivity. Tumors expressing
diminished levels of autophagy-initiating genes are resistant
to paclitaxel therapy, whereas induction of autophagy
improves the antitumoral efficiency of the microtubule-dis-
rupting agent paclitaxel [4, 5]. Furthermore, several studies
have proposed that autophagy-related genes/proteins could
be investigated as possible prognostic or predictive markers
of paclitaxel efficacy in the clinic [6]. However, it is not
clear which autophagy-initiating genes can be used as a
predictive factor for paclitaxel response.
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a heterogeneous
class of transcripts with a minimum length of 200 bases
and
limited
protein-coding
potential
[7].
LncRNAs
exhibit a wide range of expression levels and distinct cel-
lular localizations and are thus a large and diverse class
of regulators [8]. LncRNAs can function in cis to regu-
late the expression of neighboring genes or in trans to
perform many roles in various modes [9]. The landscape
of lncRNAs dysregulated in autophagy and their molecu-
lar mechanisms in autophagy regulatory networks were
summarized in our previous study in detail [10]. Studies
have demonstrated that lncRNAs such as NBR2 and
APF can regulate autophagy processes with the aid of
certain important proteins [10]. Several lncRNAs have
also recently been implicated in the modulation of drug
resistance [11]. However, the relationship between lncRNA
expression and paclitaxel insensitivity caused by abnormal
autophagy remains largely unexplored.
Eosinophil granule ontogeny transcript (EGOT), as an
antisense intronic long noncoding RNA (Ai-lncRNA), is
expressed from ITPR1, which is a ligand-gated ion chan-
nel that mediates calcium release from intracellular
stores [12, 13]. The biology function of Ai-lncRNAs in-
cluding EGOT is still largely unknown. In our previous
study, we first reported that downregulation of EGOT
expression was correlated with advanced malignant sta-
tus and worse prognosis in breast cancer [14]. Here, we
describe a previously unrecognized role of EGOT in in-
creasing sensitivity to paclitaxel via triggering autophagy.
Mechanistically, EGOT enhances autophagosome accu-
mulation via the upregulation of ITPR1 expression in cis
and in trans. On one hand, EGOT upregulates ITPR1
levels via formation of a pre-ITPR1/EGOT dsRNA that
induces pre-ITPR1 accumulation to increase ITPR1 protein
expression in cis. On the other hand, EGOT recruits
hnRNPH1 to enhance the alternative splicing of pre-ITPR1
in trans via two binding motifs in EGOT segment 2 (324–
645 nucleotides) in exon 1. We also uncover that hypoxia
induces EGOT transcriptional expression, while estrogen
suppresses its expression directly. Finally, EGOT is con-
firmed to be associated with a favorable prognosis and to
enhance paclitaxel sensitivity in breast cancer patients and
other human malignancies in our breast cancer cohort and
public data cohorts. Given its significance in the autophagy
signaling pathway, EGOT may be act as a promising pre-
dictive biomarker for paclitaxel response, and proper regu-
lation of EGOT may be a novel synergistic strategy for
enhancing paclitaxel sensitivity in human cancer.
Materials and methods
Breast specimens and clinical assessments
Eligible patients with a histological diagnosis of breast
cancer who had received neither chemotherapy nor
radiotherapy before surgical resection were recruited to
the present study. In total, 258 breast cancer tissues and
258 normal tissues, along with 15 adjuvant chemotherapy
regimens, were obtained from Harbin Medical University
Cancer Hospital/Center in Harbin, China. All samples were
frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after surgical resec-
tion, and only tumors with > 80% tumor cells were selected
for RNA extraction. Two independent senior pathologists
confirmed the pathological diagnosis and molecular sub-
type of each cancer tissue. This study conformed to the
clinical research guidelines and was approved by the re-
search ethics committee of Harbin Medical University
Cancer Hospital. We obtained written informed consent
from all patients. For 184 patients, telephone follow-up was
performed to verify survival status after primary treatment.
Among them, 159 patients received paclitaxel treatment.
Cell culture and treatments
The human cervical cancer cell line HeLa and 10 breast
cancer cell lines (MCF7, T47D, UACC-812, SK-BR-3,
MDA-MB-453, MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, HCC70, BT549,
and MDA-MB-468) were obtained from the Chinese
Academy of Sciences Cell Bank and Cellbio (China), re-
spectively. All cell lines were periodically authenticated
(Cellbio). Unless specifically indicated, cells were cultured
in DMEM (R10–017-CV, Corning, USA), RPMI-1640
(R10–040-CM, Corning) or Leibovitz’s L15 (PYG0038,
Boster, China) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bo-
vine serum (0500, ScienCell, USA) at 37 °C with 5% CO2
or air and 95% humidity. In estrogen-related experiments,

MCF7 and T47D cells were washed three times with
phenol red-free DMEM and subjected to hormone
deprivation
for
up
to
3 days
with
10%
activated
charcoal-absorbed fetal calf serum (FCS; P30–2302,
PAN) before proceeding to the next steps. The reagents
used were 17 β-oestradiol (E8875, Sigma, USA), the estro-
gen receptor antagonist tamoxifen (T5648, Sigma) and ICI
182780 (Asc-131, Ascent Scientific, USA). Autophago-
some and LC3 experiments were performed as previously
described [15] and were performed in one of two ways.
Cells (10–20 × 104 cells/ml) were plated in medium con-
taining 10% serum. After 24 h, the medium was changed
to that containing 0.1% serum, and the cells were collected
48 h later with or without 100 mM CQ (ab142116, Abcam,
USA) treatment for 1 h before collection. Alternatively,
the cells were cultured with EBSS (E2888, Sigma) for the
indicated durations before collection. For the ubiquitina-
tion assay, HeLa cells were treated with MG132 (10 μM/l)
(ab141003, Abcam) for 40 min. Protein levels were de-
tected by immunoblotting and quantified by densitometry.
For the CHX chase assay, HeLa cells were incubated with
50 μg/ml CHX (Catalogue Number HY-12320, MCE,
USA) for the indicated durations (0,15, 30, 60, 120, and
180 min) as previously described [16]. For transcriptional
inhibition experiments, actinomycin D (6 μg/ml) (A1410,
Sigma) was added to the cells, and samples were harvested
at the indicated time points (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 h) as
previously described [17].
RNA extraction, reverse transcription and quantitative RT-
PCR and PCR array
Total RNA and miRNA were extracted from cells using
the E.Z.N.A.® Total RNA Kit I (Catalogue Number
R6834–01, Omega Bio-Tek, USA). First-strand cDNA
was prepared with the Transcriptor First Strand cDNA
Synthesis Kit (Catalogue Number 04897030001, Roche,
USA). Real-time PCR was performed using FastStart
Universal SYBR Green Master (ROX) (Catalogue Number
04913914001, Roche) on a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR
system (ABI, USA). For quantification of gene expression,
we used the 2-ΔΔCt method. GAPDH expression was used
for normalization. The primer sequences were synthesized
by Shanghai Generary Biotech Co., Ltd. and are included
in Additional file 1: Table S1.
Lentivirus production and infection
Recombinant lentiviruses expressing the lncRNA EGOT,
shEGOT, shITPR1, shESR, EGOT-MS2, Flag-MCP2 and
controls were constructed by Sangon Biotech Company
(China). Concentrated viruses were used to infect 5 × 105
cells in a 6-well plate with 4–6 μg/ml polybrene (107,689,
Sigma). The infected cells were then subjected to selection
with 1 μg/ml puromycin (Catalogue Number 540411,
Calbiochem, USA) for two weeks. Stable overexpression
cell lines or knockdown cell lines were identified using
qRT-PCR or western blotting. The shRNA sequences are
provided in Additional file 1: Table S1.
Co-immunoprecipitation, western blot assay and antibodies
Co-immunoprecipitation assays were carried out by
using the Pierce™Crosslink Magnetic IP/Co-IP Kit
(Catalogue Number 88805, Thermo Fisher, USA) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Western blotting was per-
formed according to the previously described procedures
[18]. Anti-LC3B (ab48394, 1:1000), anti-IP3R (ab5804,
1:1000) antibody, anti-SQSTM1/P62 (ab91526, 1:1000)
antibody,
anti-hnRNPH1
(ab10374,

antibody,
anti-HMGB1
(ab79823,

antibody,
anti-RIP140
(ab42126,1:500) antibody, goat anti-rabbit IgG H&L (HRP)
(ab6721, 1:10,000), and goat anti-mouse IgG H&L (HRP)
(ab6789, 1:10,000) were obtained from Abcam. Anti-tubu-
lin (sc-73,242, 1:1000) antibody was purchased from
Santa
Cruz
Biotechnology.
Anti-estrogen
receptor
(WL00940,
1:1000)
antibody
and
anti-GAPDH
(WL01114,
1:1000)
antibody
were
obtained
from
Wanleibio (China). Anti-Bax (D2E11, 1:1000) (5023)
antibody, anti-Bcl2 (2872, 1:1000) antibody and c-Jun
(60A8) Rabbit mAb (#9165, 1:500) antibody were ob-
tained from Cell Signaling Technologies (CST). Total
cell lysates were prepared using a 1 × sodium dodecyl
sulfate buffer. Identical quantities of proteins were
separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose
filter membranes. After incubation with specific anti-
bodies, the blots were incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG
H&L (HRP) and goat anti-mouse IgG H&L (HRP) for 1 h
at room temperature. The proteins were detected using a
FluorChem HD2 (Protein Simple, USA).
Tandem mRFP-GFP fluorescence microscopy
Tandem monomeric RFP-GFP-tagged LC3 (tfLC3) (HB-
AP2100001, Hanbio, China) was used to monitor au-
tophagic flux as previously reported. LC3-II relocalized
to the autophagosomal membranes during autophagy.
Thus, the accumulation of mRFP-GFP-LC3 puncta is an
effective way to detect autophagosomes. When tfLC3 is
located in autolysosomes, this form of LC3 displays only
red fluorescence since the GFP signal is sensitive to the
acidic condition in the lysosome lumen, whereas the
RFP signal is more stable. To evaluate tandem fluores-
cent LC3 puncta, 48 h after tfLC3 transfection, cells were
washed once with 1 × PBS, incubated with EBSS (E2888,
Sigma) for the indicated durations and then directly sent
out for confocal microscopy analysis. Images of samples
were captured using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal micro-
scope system (Carl Zeiss, Germany) and processed with
ZEN LE software (Carl Zeiss).

Subcellular fractionation
Nuclear/cytoplasmic isolation was carried out by using
the NE-PER™Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Re-
agents (Catalogue Number 78835, Thermo Fisher) accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s protocol. Subcellular fractions
were prepared as follows. Cytoplasmic and nuclear frac-
tions were divided for RNA extraction. GAPDH and U1
were used as qRT-PCR markers of cytoplasmic and nu-
clear RNAs, respectively.
Transmission electron microscopy
Conventional electron microscopy was performed as
previously described [19]. In brief, cells were fixed with
2.5% glutaraldehyde and then postfixed with 1% osmium
tetroxide, dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and em-
bedded in Embed 812 resin. Ultrathin sections were
mounted on copper grids and then double-stained with
uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The samples were exam-
ined and photographed with an FEI Tecnai spirit trans-
mission electron microscope.
RNA-FISH assay
To detect EGOT and pre-ITPR1 mRNAs, we used the
QuantiGene® ViewRNA ISH Cell Assay Kit (Catalogue
Number QVC0001, Thermo Fisher) to perform the
QuantiGene ViewRNA FISH assay according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. EGOT, ITPR1 and ACTB (as
control) hybridization was carried out using cy3, cy5,
and 488-nm DNA-oligonucleotide probes in a moist
chamber, respectively. After digestion with a working
protease solution, slides were incubated with RNase III
(AM2290, Life Technologies, USA) or RNase A (AM2272,
Life Technologies) for 2 h if RNase enzymatic activity was
to be determined. Standard immunofluorescence and im-
aging were performed by confocal microscopy. The details
of the probe sets and corresponding gene sequences are
provided in Additional file 1: Table S2.
TUNEL assay
To detect apoptosis in sections of tumor tissues, TUNEL
assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Catalogue Number 11684795910, Roche)
as previously described [20]. The sections were analyzed
by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus, Japan).
RNA pull-down assay
The Flag-MS2bp-MS2bs-based RNA pull-down assay
was carried out by using the Anti-Flag M2 Affinity Gel
(Catalogue Number A2220, Sigma) as previously de-
scribed [21]. In short, lentivirus Flag-MS2bp and lentivirus
EGOT MS2bs were cotransfected into breast cancer cells,
and the cells were harvested after 48 h. Approximately
1 × 107 cells were lysed in soft lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl,
pH 8.0, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.5% NP-40)
containing RNasin (80 units/ml). Fifty microliters of
Anti-Flag M2 Magnetic beads was added to each bind-
ing reaction tube and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The
beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and
boiled in 1x loading buffer for 10 min. Finally, the re-
trieved proteins were analyzed by a NanoLC-ESI-MS/
MS system (ProtTech, China).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and ChIP-seq
Analysis of genome-wide NRIP1 and AP-1 occupancy
was carried out using specific and internally validated
antibodies. We purchased the EZ-ChIP™Chromatin
Immunoprecipitation
Kit
(Catalogue
Number
#17–
371, Millipore, USA) to perform ChIP and ChIP-seq
using MCF7 cells as previously described [22]. Briefly,
MCF7 cells were subjected to hormone deprivation
for up to 3 days and then treated with 1 nM E2 or
ethanol (control) for 6 h. Approximately 2 × 107 cells
were used for each ChIP or ChIP-Seq assay. Chromatin
DNA precipitated by polyclonal antibodies against AP-1
or NRIP1 was purified with the Universal DNA purifica-
tion kit (DP214, Tiangen, China) according to the manu-
facturer’s protocol. Rabbit anti-RIP140 (ab42126, Abcam)
and rabbit anti-c-JUN (60A8) (Catalogue Number #9165,
CST) antibodies and rabbit IgG (sc-2027, Santa Cruz,
USA) were used. ChIP-PCR enrichment of target loci was
normalized to input DNA and reported as % input ±
s.e.m. ChIP libraries were prepared using ChIP DNA ac-
cording to the BGISEQ-500ChIP-Seq library preparation
protocol. In-depth whole-genome DNA sequencing was
performed by BGI (Shenzhen, China). ChIP-seq data were
deposited in the NCBI SRA: SRP149488 (https://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRP149488).
Transient transfection of cells
For downregulation of NRIP1 and hnRNPH1 expression,
siRNAs targeting NRIP1 and hnRNPH1 were purchased
from Sigma. Cancer cells were transfected with 100 pM
siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (11668–019, Invitrogen,
USA). The siRNA sequences are provided in Additional
file 1: Table S1. After HeLa and T47D cells (5 × 105 cells/
well) were cultured in 6-well plates for 24 h, siRNA or the
corresponding controls were transfected into the cells by
Lipofectamine 2000 reagent in accordance with the manu-
facturer’s protocol. Total RNA was extracted 48 h after
transfection.
Animal experiment
Female athymic BALB/c nude mice (5 weeks old) were
obtained from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal
Technology Co, Ltd. (Beijing, China). All of the animal
experiments were performed according to approved pro-
tocols and in accordance with the guidelines of the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
Xu et al. Molecular Cancer           (2019) 18:89 
Page 4 of 18
(Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, Commission
on Life Sciences, National Research Council). The proto-
col was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of Center of Harbin Medical University.
Approximately 8 × 106 UACC-812 cells resuspended in
0.2 ml of 25% phenol red-free Matrigel (Catalogue
Number
356234,
Corning)
with
0.9%
NaCl
were
injected in the axilla of five-week-old BALB/c mice.
After the tumors grew to approximately 300–500 mm3
in size, 15 mg/kg paclitaxel was administered once
every 4 days for a total of three courses. Tumor volume
was measured once every 2 days by using calipers at the
indicated time points. The tumor volume was estimated
by the following formula: length × width × width/2.
The whole body weight of mice was measured once
every 2 days as indicated. All mice were euthanized by
intraperitoneal injection of 200 mg/kg pentobarbital at
the end of the experiment.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical (IHC) detection of ITPR1 and
LC3B was performed on each slide. Each section was in-
cubated with anti-LC3B (1:200) antibody or anti-IP3R
(1:200) antibody solution. The proportion and intensity
of ITPR1 and LC3 staining were evaluated in a series of
10 randomly selected high-power fields (magnification,
400×), which were considered to represent the average
expression. The IHC staining intensity was graded as 0
(no staining), 1 (weak staining = light yellow), 2 (moder-
ate staining = yellow brown) or 3 (strong staining =
brown). The proportion of positively stained tumor cells
in a field was scored as 0 (no positive tumor cells), 1
(fewer than 10% positive tumor cells), 2 (10–50% posi-
tive tumor cells) or 3 (more than 50% positive tumor
cells). The staining index (SI) for each sample was ob-
tained by multiplying the intensity and proportion
values, with a score of less than 4 being classified as low
expression.
Library preparation for lncRNA sequencing
A total of 3 μg of RNA per sample was used for down-
stream RNA sample preparation. Ribosomal RNA was re-
moved
using
the
Ribo-Zero™
Gold
kit
(Epicentre,
Wisconsin, USA). Subsequently, sequencing libraries were
generated according to the manufacturer’s recommenda-
tions, and the libraries were sequenced on an Illumina
HiSeq 2500 platform to generate 100-bp paired-end reads.
Raw sequencing and processed RNASeq data from this
study have been deposited into the NCBI GEO database
under accession number GSE71651 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?token=obcxosaur
xoppwx
&
acc = GSE71651).
Access and analysis of public data
GDS723,
GDS4121,
GDS1453
and
GSE11324
were
downloaded from GEO datasets (http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/geo/) and processed according to our previous
study [23]. Genome-wide EGOT and ITPR1 expression
profiles and clinical pathology information for human
cancers were downloaded from The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/), International
Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) (http://icgc.org/) and
Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) (http://www.broad
institute.org/ccle). All transcripts were normalized by log2
transformation. The expression of EGOT or ITPR1 was
dichotomized using a study-specific median expression as
the cut-off to define high values (at or above the median)
versus low values (below the median). Guilt-by-association
analysis was performed according to our previous study
[23]. Correlations between genes were assessed by Pearson
correlation coefficients. Unpaired Student’s t-tests were
used to detect significant differences among tumors or be-
tween tumor and normal samples. The overall survival
(OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were calculated as the
time from surgery until the occurrence of death and re-
lapse, respectively. The log-rank test was used to examine
the survival difference between different patient groups. All
statistical tests were two-sided, and P < 0.05 indicated statis-
tical significance.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as the mean ± s.d. of at least three in-
dependent experiments for each cellular experimental
group and at least five independent experiments for each
animal group. Student’s t-tests were used to determine
statistically significant differences between groups. Cor-
relations between EGOT expression and a pathological
response were determined by the chi-square test. All
statistical tests were two-sided, and P < 0.05 indicated
statistical significance. Statistical analysis was performed
using R.3.4 graphics software and GraphPad Prism soft-
ware (GraphPad Software, USA).
Results
Ai-lncRNA EGOT enhances paclitaxel sensitivity in human
cancer
Whole transcriptome sequencing of 33 breast specimens
showed that Ai-lncRNA EGOT was expressed at low
levels in cancer tissues compared with its levels in
adjacent normal tissues (Fig. 1a and Additional file 2:
Figure S1a). This result was subsequently validated in
258 pairs of breast cancer tissues and adjacent normal
tissues
in
the
Harbin
Medical
University
Cancer
Centre (HMUCC) cohort (Fig. 1b) and in data from
other cancer contexts in TCGA (Additional file 2:
Figure S1b).

To further investigate the biological functions of EGOT,
we performed guilt-by-association analysis and found that
EGOT was involved in multiple cellular microtubule-associ-
ated functions (Additional file 1: Table S3). Because pacli-
taxel is commonly used as a microtubule-disrupting agent,
we suspected that EGOT may impact paclitaxel sensitivity in
tumor cells. As expected, analysis of public data from CCLE
showed that EGOT increases the sensitivity of tumor cells to
paclitaxel (Additional file 2: Figure S1c). To validate the
potential function of EGOT in mediating the paclitaxel
response, we then generated stable overexpression and
knockdown of EGOT in cancer cell lines (Additional
file 2: Figure S1d-f). As shown in Fig. 1c and Additional
file 2: Figure S1g, we determined that EGOT overex-
pression significantly increased the sensitivity of cancer
cells to paclitaxel. Conversely, silencing EGOT pro-
tected cancer cells from paclitaxel (Fig. 1d).
Furthermore, we found that there was no distinct dif-
ference of xenografts in the presence of EGOT or con-
trol without treatment of paclitaxel in UACC-812 cell
xenograft models (Fig. 1e-g). However, EGOT overex-
pression (Additional file 2: Figure S1 h) in UACC-812
and HeLa cell xenografts grew more slowly than control
ones when treated with paclitaxel (Fig. 1e and Additional
file 2: Figure S1i). Moreover, the weight and volume of
the tumors were decreased in the EGOT overexpression
group compared with those in the control group with
treatment of paclitaxel (Fig. 1f and g). Similar results
were obtained in HeLa cell xenografts (Additional file 2:
Figure S1j and k). More importantly, cell apoptosis was
much higher in the EGOT overexpression group than in
the control group when treated with paclitaxel (Fig. 1h).
Collectively, these data demonstrate that EGOT en-
hances the sensitivity of human cancer cells to paclitaxel
both in vitro and in vivo.
EGOT expression is positively correlated with ITPR1
expression
We then sought to identify interacting partner(s) involved
in EGOT-mediated paclitaxel sensitivity. Certain mamma-
lian lncRNAs are embedded in the intronic-antisense re-
gions of protein-coding genes and regulate the genes to
exert their function [24]. Thus, we hypothesized the exist-
ence of a functional relationship between EGOT and ITPR1.
To study this possibility, by analyzing whole-transcriptome
sequencing data, we found that EGOT expression was posi-
tively correlated with ITPR1 expression at the mRNA level
(Additional file 2: Figure S2a). The result was validated
using breast cancer specimens in the HMUCC cohort
(Fig. 2a); moreover, EGOT expression was also positively
correlated with ITPR1 protein expression in the HMUCC
cohort (Additional file 2: Figure S2b). To expand the
generalizability of our results, human cancer data from 33
cancer contexts, including breast cancer, in TCGA were an-
alyzed, and the results further validated as above (Fig. 2b
and c; Additional file 1: Table S4). Furthermore, examin-
ation of CCLE data also revealed that EGOT expression
was positively correlated with ITPR1 mRNA expression in
human breast cancer cell lines and other cancer cell lines
(Fig. 2d and e; Additional file 2: Figure S2c-f). These results
indicate that EGOT expression is positively correlated with
ITPR1 expression in cancer.
To further validate the relationship between EGOT
and ITPR1expression, we detected the genes near the
EGOT locus (less than 2 Mb). EGOT overexpression was
shown to increase the expression of ITPR1 mRNA
(Fig. 2f and g), while EGOT knockdown decreased the
expression of ITPR1 mRNA (Additional file 2: Figure S2 g).
Consistent with these results, ITPR1 protein levels were
also increased following EGOT overexpression and were
decreased following EGOT knockdown (Fig. 2h). However,
EGOT expression did not significantly change following
ITPR1 knockdown (Additional file 2: Figure S2 h). Collect-
ively, these data suggest that EGOT may induce ITPR1 ex-
pression in human cancer.
EGOT induces autophagy to enhance paclitaxel sensitivity
through ITPR1
To illustrate that ITPR1 plays a functional role in
autophagy in human cancer cells, we investigated autoph-
agic activity in cells after 48 h of growth under low-serum
(0.1%) conditions or in Earle’s balanced salt solution
(EBSS) to simulate stress-induced autophagy, as previously
described [15]. Knockdown of ITPR1 decreased LC3-II/

LC3-I levels and increased P62 expression in the presence
of chloroquine (CQ) or EBSS (Additional file 2: Figure S3a
and b). Moreover, nutrient starvation failed to induce
autophagy when ITPR1 was knocked down in cancer
cells, as shown by confocal microscopy examination
48 h after mRFP-GFP-LC3 adenovirus vector transfec-
tion (Additional file 2: Figure S3c and d). Addition-
ally, electron microscopy examination indicated that
ITPR1 knockdown reduced the number of autophagic
vesicles (Additional file 2: Figure S3e).
We next explored whether EGOT was involved in
autophagy via ITPR1 in the presence of CQ or EBSS. As
expected, overexpression of EGOT increased LC3-II/
LC3-I levels and reduced P62 expression in HeLa and
breast cancer cells (Fig. 3a and b; Additional file 2:
Figure S3f and g), while knockdown of EGOT reduced
LC3-II/LC3-I levels and increased P62 expression (Fig. 3c
and d). Meanwhile, overexpression of EGOT induced au-
tophagy, as shown by the increases in mRFP-GFP-LC3
puncta accumulation and the number of autophagic vesi-
cles (Fig. 3e and g; Additional file 2: Figure S3 h). In con-
trast, knockdown of EGOT caused the opposite changes
(Fig. 3f and h). Moreover, EGOT-induced autophagy could
be reversed by ITPR1 knockdown in HeLa and MCF7
cells (Fig. 3k; Additional file 2: Figure S3i). These results
revealed that EGOT can at least partly convey the autoph-
agic signal via ITPR1.
Furthermore, by analyzing CCLE data, we found that
ITPR1 may impact paclitaxel sensitivity in tumor cells
(Additional file 2: Figure S3j). The result was validated
by experimental evidence showing that ITPR1 knock-
down conferred protection to cancer cells from pacli-
taxel (Additional file 2: Figure S3k). Moreover, paclitaxel
sensitivity induced by EGOT overexpression could be re-
pressed by ITPR1 knockdown in vitro (Additional file 2:
Figure S3 l). In addition, EGOT-overexpressing tumors
exposed to paclitaxel treatment in vivo expressed high
levels of ITPR1 and LC3B proteins (Fig. 3i; Additional
file 2: Figure S3 m and n). Consistently, breast cancer tis-
sues with higher EGOT levels showed higher ITPR1 and
LC3B levels in the HMUCC cohort, suggesting that the
increased expression of EGOT may force a connection
with the autophagic pathway via ITPR1 (Fig. 3j). These
results indicate that EGOT enhances paclitaxel sensitiv-
ity through ITPR1 in human cancer.
EGOT regulates ITPR1 expression both in cis and in trans
in human cancer
Emerging evidence shows that lncRNAs can regulate
gene expression and protein functions in trans or in cis
[9]. Some lncRNAs are known to be involved in regulat-
ing protein synthesis or protein stability in mammalian
cells [25]. We found that neither ITPR1 protein synthe-
sis nor protein stability appeared to have any significant
effect on the overexpression of EGOT via assays using
the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) and
the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Additional file 2:
Figure S4a and b).
By fractionated nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA analysis
and RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH)
examination in four cancer cell lines, we found that
EGOT is mainly expressed in the nucleus (Fig. 4a and b;
Additional file 2: Figure S4c and d), suggesting that
EGOT exerts its regulatory function for ITPR1 at the
transcriptional level. Of note, ectopic expression of
EGOT induced endogenous upregulation of pre-ITPR1
(Fig. 4c), while EGOT knockdown suppressed endogenous
expression of pre-ITPR1 (Fig. 4d). Moreover, the stability
of pre-ITPR1 mRNA was increased in EGOT-overexpres-
sing cancer cells compared with that in control cells,
as shown in the transcriptional inhibition experiments
(Additional file 2: Figure S4e).
Given that EGOT is complementary to intronic se-
quences of the ITPR1 and is transcribed in the antisense
direction, we hypothesized that a double-stranded (ds)
RNA forms between EGOT and pre-ITPR1. As expected,
dual-RNA-FISH assay indicated that EGOT and pre-ITPR1
hybridized in the same nuclear foci (Fig. 4e). These foci
were completely depleted upon treatment with RNase III,
which degrades only dsRNA, but not with RNase A, which
degrades only single-stranded (ss) RNA (Fig. 4e), thereby
indicating the formation of dsRNA from the physical
association of EGOT and pre-ITPR1 (Additional file 2:
Figure S4f). Furthermore, through domain mapping, two
exons of EGOT were divided into four fragments (Fig. 4f).
Interestingly, EGOT fragment 2 (324–645 nucleotides) in
exon 1 increases ITPR1 protein levels as well as ITPR1
and pre-ITPR1 mRNA levels, whereas other fragments do
not possess these capacities (Fig. 4g and h). Taken to-
gether, these data indicate the pivotal roles of EGOT frag-
ment 2 (324–645 nucleotides) in exon 1, which binds to
pre-ITPR1 to control ITPR1 expression in cis in human
cancer.
Accumulating evidence suggests that lncRNA activity
is centered on its ability to bind and regulate epigenetic
complexes of methylation, acetylation and phosphorylation
[26, 27]. Therefore, by using the Flag-MS2bp-MS2bs-based
system (Additional file 2: Figure S4 g) and, subsequently,
mass
spectrometry
examination
(Additional
file
1:
Table S5), hnRNPH1 was pulled down in this process,
and the result was validated in four other cancer cell
lines (Fig. 4i). RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) further
revealed that hnRNPH1 bound to both EGOT and
pre-ITPR1 mRNA (Fig. 4j). Given the earlier evidence
that hnRNPH1 interacts with RNA-binding proteins
to improve alternative splicing [28], inhibition of hnRNPH1
expression may suppress alternative splicing of its target.
As expected, knockdown of hnRNPH1 decreased ITPR1

mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 4k and l). As EGOT frag-
ment 2 (324–645 nucleotides) in exon 1 binds to pre-ITPR1
mRNA in cis (Fig. 4g), ectopic expression of EGOT frag-
ment 2 (324–645) resulted in enrichment of hnRNPH1 by
the RNA pull-down assays (Fig. 4m). hnRNPH1 has been
reported to regulate alternative splicing by binding to
specific motifs (GGGA) [29]. Moreover, mutation of the
specific binding motifs (mut-A and mut-C) in EGOT
fragment 2 led to the failure of hnRNPH1 enrichment
(Fig. 4n). Altogether, these data demonstrated that
hnRNPH1 is recruited by EGOT fragment 2 to enhance
the alternative splicing of pre-ITPR1 in trans.
EGOT expression is transcriptionally regulated by stress in
human cancer
Through guilt-by-association analysis, we found that EGOT
is involved in stress-associated conditions (Additional file 1:
Table S1). Stress, including hypoxia, estrogen depletion,
radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, has been shown to affect
autophagy induction [30–33]. Thus, we first aimed to deter-
mine whether EGOT is regulated by hypoxia. Hypoxia (1%
oxygen) treatment induced a sustained upregulation of
EGOT in a time-dependent manner in several cell types
(Additional file 2: Figure S5a-e). Moreover, by analyzing
previously published GEO datasets (GDS4121, GDS1453
and GDS723) involving different stress treatments, we
found that EGOT was also upregulated in the absence of
HGF stimulation or treatment with camptothecin or radi-
ation (Additional file 2: Figure S5f-h). Furthermore, EGOT
was upregulated in breast cancer patients who underwent
neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with its expression in
patients who did not receive such therapy in the HMUCC
cohort (Additional file 2: Figure S5i).
Estrogen (E2) is strongly related to breast cancer and
has been shown to inhibit autophagy in a previous report
[34]. Regarding the potential role of E2 in regulating
EGOT expression, E2 indeed suppressed EGOT expres-
sion in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5a). Moreover, ana-
lysis from the GSE11324 dataset further certified the
relationship of EGOT inhibition by E2, which was accord-
ance with our results above (Additional file 2: Figure S6a).
Concordantly, the expression levels of several positive
control genes that are negatively regulated by E2, such as
IRX4, GUSB, BCAS4 and MUC1, were decreased after E2
stimulation (Fig. 5b). In contrast, EGOT expression was
induced in response to treatment with the anti-estrogen
agents tamoxifen and fulvestrant (ICI) (Fig. 5c and
Additional file 2: Figure S6b). In addition, knockdown
of the estrogen receptor (ER) in MCF7 cells was
shown to induce the expression of EGOT by > 10-fold
(Fig. 5d), while the expression of the positive control
gene GREB1, which was reported to be positively reg-
ulated by E2, was decreased, and that of the IRX4,
which was reported to be negatively regulated by E2,
was increased (Additional file 2: Figure S6c). Furthermore,
time course analysis demonstrated that E2 suppressed
EGOT expression in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 5e).
Moreover, dose-dependent inhibition of EGOT expression
by E2 was also observed in other ER-positive T47D breast
cancer cells (Additional file 2: Figure S6d). In all, these re-
sults demonstrate that EGOT is transcriptionally inhibited
by E2 in ER-positive breast cancer cells.
Next, we determined the molecular mechanism under-
lying such transcriptional repression. Estrogen-inducible
NRIP1 acts as a nuclear receptor corepressor and inter-
acts with AP-1 to directly repress target genes via ERE
or AP-1 elements [35]. The expression of NRIP1 was in-
duced, whereas EGOT expression was decreased after E2
treatment in MCF7 cells (Fig. 5f). As expected, transcrip-
tional repression of EGOT by E2 was markedly reversed
and the positive control gene GREB1 was upregulated in
the presence of siNRIP1 (Fig. 5g and h; Additional file 2:
Figure S6e), demonstrating that NRIP1 is necessary and
involved in this process. Furthermore, coimmunoprecipi-
tation assays revealed that NRIP1 bound to AP-1 (Fig. 5i).
Moreover, NRIP1 and AP-1 chromatin immunoprecipita-
tion sequencing experiments showed that AP-1 and
NRIP1 binding sites were enriched near the transcription
(See figure on previous page.)

start sites (−5 kb to 5 kb) of target genes (Additional
file 2: Figure S6f). Interestingly, significant enrichment
peaks for AP-1 and NRIP1 were detected at a gen-
omic locus (chr 3: 4757428–4,757,590) upstream of
the transcription start site of EGOT (Fig. 5j). Next,
the binding of AP-1 and NRIP1 to the promoter region of
EGOT was validated by ChIP-quantitative PCR (ChIP-PCR)
(Fig. 5k). Taken together, our results indicated that NRIP1
physically interacts with AP-1 and transcriptionally re-
presses the expression of EGOT in presence of E2 (Fig. 5l).
EGOT/ITPR1 expression is associated with a favorable
prognosis and enhances paclitaxel sensitivity in human
cancer
The prognostic role of EGOT and ITPR1 was finally
examined in the HMUCC and public cohort data. High
expression of EGOT was associated with favorable OS
and RFS) in breast cancer patients, while loss of ITPR1
indicated worse RFS in the HMUCC cohort (Fig. 6a and
b; Additional file 2: Figure S7a). These results were then
validated in 14,586 cancer patients in TCGA and ICGC
human cancer cohorts, and patients with high expres-
sion levels of EGOT showed favorable OS and RFS in
both of 33 human cancer types and breast cancer co-
horts (Fig. 6c and d; Additional file 2: Figure S7b and c),
while patients with high ITPR1 expression showed favor-
able OS in the human cancer cohort (Additional file 2:
Figure S7d and e).
Regarding paclitaxel sensitivity, breast cancer patients
who were treated with paclitaxel and exhibited high ex-
pression levels of EGOT demonstrated better OS and
RFS than patients with low expression levels of EGOT in
the HMUCC cohort (Fig. 6e and f). Moreover, the re-
sults were further validated in TCGA breast cancer pa-
tients treated with paclitaxel, which showed that high
expression of EGOT was also associated with favorable
OS, in accordance with our study (Fig. 6g). Similarly,
loss of ITPR1 was associated with poor RFS in breast
cancer patients treated with paclitaxel in the HMUCC
cohort (Additional file 2: Figure S7f). More importantly,
breast cancer patients with high expression of EGOT
achieved a higher complete pathological response ratio
than patients with low expression of EGOT when treated
with paclitaxel-containing adjuvant chemotherapy regi-
mens in the HMUCC cohort (Fig. 6h). Therefore,
EGOT/ITPR1 expression is associated with a favorable
prognosis and enhances paclitaxel sensitivity in human
cancer.
Discussion
Regarding the function of Ai-lncRNA EGOT, we first re-
ported that low levels of EGOT expression were signifi-
cantly correlated with increased tumor size, lymph node
metastasis, and Ki-67 expression in human breast cancer
[14]. In this study, we identified an uncharacterized
lncRNA, EGOT, and its roles in enhancing paclitaxel
sensitivity by triggering autophagosome accumulation.
Mechanistically, EGOT regulates ITPR1 expression in cis
and in trans, leading to the activation of autophagy sig-
naling. We also found that EGOT is transcriptionally
regulated by various stress conditions that are associated
with paclitaxel resistance. Overall, we provide compel-
ling evidence that in response to stress, EGOT activates
autophagy via ITPR1, which sensitizes paclitaxel cytotox-
icity in human cancer (Additional file 2: Figure S8).
Several studies have investigated the role of macrophages
in decreasing the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy and
demonstrated a therapeutic window for autophagy inhib-
ition in cancer therapy and prevention [36, 37]. Paradoxic-
ally, a previous study showed that autophagy enhances
paclitaxel-induced cell death and that reduced autophagy
may contribute to clinical chemotherapeutic resistance in
primary breast tumors [6]. Of note, paclitaxel blocks the ac-
tivation of PI3K and Vps34 and inhibits the movement and
maturation of autophagosomes to induce cell death [6]. In
vitro, autophagosome accumulation sensitizes cells to
(See figure on previous page.)

paclitaxel toxicity [6]. Using in vivo and in vitro experi-
ments in this study, we found that EGOT overexpression
activated autophagy signaling, which sensitizes cells to pac-
litaxel, whereas EGOT knockdown has the opposite effect,
in accordance with this previous study. Mechanistically,
EGOT upregulates the expression of ITPR1, which pro-
motes autophagosome accumulation and sensitizes cells to
paclitaxel toxicity, thereby highlighting a novel function for
these molecules.
Loss or low expression of autophagy-related genes, in-
dicating a decrease of autophagic flux, was associated
with poor prognosis [38, 39]. High expression of EGOT
is significantly associated with favorable OS and RFS in
patients in the HMUCC cohort and TCGA and ICGC
public datasets. Furthermore, recent study showed that
autophagy-related genes/proteins could be possible predict-
ive markers for paclitaxel efficacy in the clinic [6]. High ex-
pression of EGOT is significantly associated with enhanced
paclitaxel sensitivity in patients in the HMUCC cohort and
TCGA and ICGC public datasets, while the lack of EGOT
expression indicates resistance to paclitaxel therapy. In
addition, high expression of EGOT indicated an increased
complete pathological response ratio following treatment
with paclitaxel-containing adjuvant chemotherapy regi-
mens, in contrast to patients with low EGOT expression in
the HMUCC cohort. However, paclitaxel-containing adju-
vant chemotherapy sensitivity has only been evaluated in a
small study cohort; thus, a multicenter clinical trial with a
larger patient number will be performed in a future study
to validate these results. Hence, our study provides a proof
of concept showing that EGOT may be a predictive marker
of the clinical efficacy of paclitaxel treatment.
LncRNAs can function in cis to regulate the expres-
sion of neighboring genes or in trans to carry out many
roles by various modes [9]. Compared to other category
of long non-coding RNAs, the function of Ai-lncRNAs
including EGOT is still largely unknown. In this study,
we clearly demonstrated that EGOT regulates ITPR1 ex-
pression both in cis and in trans. On one hand, EGOT reg-
ulates ITPR1 levels via a unique regulatory mechanism
involving the formation of a pre-ITPR1/EGOT dsRNA that
induces pre-ITPR1 accumulation to increase ITPR1 pro-
tein expression in cis. However, we should mention that
although it was initially proposed that lncRNA mainly
functions to regulate neighboring gene transcription, other
studies have shown that many lncRNAs do not exert such
function [40, 41]. Thus, whether EGOT regulates any
other neighboring gene transcription in cis awaits further
investigation. Furthermore, EGOT recruits hnRNPH1 to
promote ITPR1 expression in trans. hnRNPH1, a splicing
factor, has been shown to regulate alternative splicing and
polyadenylation [42, 43]. EGOT fragment 2 (324–645 nu-
cleotides) in exon 1 was found to bind pre-ITPR1 mRNA
and the hnRNPH1 protein, thereby mediating alternative
splicing of pre-ITPR1 mRNA. hnRNPH1 has been shown
to bind G-rich sequences interspersed with adenosines
around exons [28, 42]. ITPR1 contains 59 exons and mul-
tiple GGGA/C/G motifs distributed in these exons. Thus,
we propose that hnRNPH1 mediates pre-ITPR1 splicing in
human cancer by binding these GGGA/C/G motifs. Taken
together, these findings broaden the understanding of the
autophagy-associated
lncRNA
landscape
and
provide
novel insights into the exploration of the mechanism of
autophagy regulation in human cancer.
Our data also show that EGOT is positively and negatively
transcriptionally regulated by hypoxia and estrogen-related
stress, respectively, in human cancer. Studies have shown
that hypoxia can promote tumor invasion, metastasis, au-
tophagy, and angiogenesis, can regulate tumor metabolism
and is closely related to the poor prognosis of cancers
[44, 45]. Hypoxia is associated with the expression of
numerous noncoding RNAs, including miRNAs and
lncRNAs [46]. In this study, EGOT was induced in vitro
by subjecting different cancer cell lines to hypoxia.
Apart from its positive regulation by hypoxia, EGOT
can be transcriptionally repressed by estrogen. Estro-
gen, a paracrine mediator throughout life, is an import-
ant factor in tumorigenesis in humans. Estrogen binds
to estrogen receptors to control vast gene networks
that are involved in glycolysis, glutaminolysis, oxidative
(See figure on previous page.)

pathways in cancer [47]. Several lncRNAs have been shown
to be regulated by estrogen in breast cancer [22, 48]. In this
study, EGOT was found to be a direct target of AP-1/
NRIP1-mediated transcriptional repression complex in the
presence of estrogen. Previous studies have shown that
NRIP1 is an obligate co-factor of the estrogen receptor,
and germline single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
near NRIP1 have been associated with ER-positive
breast cancer [49]. Estrogen mediates NRIP1 induction,

paclitaxel-containing adjuvant chemotherapy regimens (left). EGOT and ITPR1 levels (normalized to GAPDH) were subjected to Pearson’s correlation
analysis. Correlations between EGOT expression and a pathological response were determined by the chi-square test (right). A complete pathological
response is denoted by CR, while a partial response is denoted by PR. The median expression level was used as the cut-off value. Patients with EGOT
expression values below the 50th percentile were classified as EGOT-Low. Patients with EGOT expression values above the 50th percentile were
classified as EGOT-High

which subsequently interacts with estrogen receptor
AP-1 complexes to directly repress adjacent target
genes, including BCAS4, IRX4, GUSB and MUC1 [35].
In this study, EGOT was inhibited by estrogen at
physiological concentrations (0–10−9 M), which led to
a gradual decrease in EGOT expression; meanwhile
NRIP1 expression was gradually increased with time.
Knockdown of NRIP1 reversed the estrogen-mediated
transcriptional repression of EGOT expression. Interest-
ingly, a previous study reported that the expression of
ITPR1
protein
decreased
in
an
estrogen
receptor-
dependent manner and that the growth of MCF7 cells
induced by estrogen was sensitive to pharmacological in-
hibitors of ITPR1 [16]. Our study provides a proof of con-
cept indicating that EGOT is transcriptionally repressed by
the AP-1/NRIP1 complex in the presence of estrogen and
that this axis may send regulatory feedback signals to re-
press the excessive activation of autophagy.
In conclusion, these findings broaden comprehensive
understanding of the biology function of Ai-lncRNAs.
Moreover, our findings demonstrate that EGOT my act
as a clinical biomarker of paclitaxel response and that
proper regulation of EGOT may be a novel synergistic
strategy for enhancing paclitaxel sensitivity, thereby en-
hancing its clinical benefits for cancer patients.
