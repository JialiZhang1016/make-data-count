Abstract
1. Needle photosynthetic potentials strongly vary among primary (juvenile) and sec-
ondary (adult) needles (heteroblasty) in Pinus species, but there is limited under-
standing of the underlying structural, diffusional and chemical controls.
2. We studied differences in needle photosynthetic characteristics among current-
year juvenile and adult needles and among different-aged adult needles in 
Mediterranean pines Pinus halepensis Mill., P. pinea L. and P. nigra J. F. Arnold 
subsp. salzmannii (Dunal) Franco, hypothesizing that needle anatomical modifica-
tions upon juvenile-to-adult transition lead to reduced photosynthetic capacity 
due to greater limitation of photosynthesis by mesophyll conductance and due to 
an increase in the share of support tissues at the expense of photosynthetic tis-
sues. We also hypothesized that such alterations occur with needle ageing, but to 
a lower degree.
3. Photosynthetic capacity per dry mass was 2.4- to 2.7-fold higher in juvenile nee-
dles, and this was associated with 3.4- to 3.7-fold greater mesophyll diffusion con-
ductance, 2- to 2.5-fold greater maximum carboxylase activity of Rubisco (Vcmax) 
and 2.2- to 3-fold greater capacity for photosynthetic electron transport (Jmax). 
The latter differences were driven by modifications in mesophyll volume fraction 
and changes in the share of nitrogen between structural and photosynthetic func-
tions. Analogous changes in photosynthetic characteristics occurred with needle 
ageing, but their extent was less.
4. These results indicate that conifer foliage photosynthetic machinery undergoes a 
profound change from a fast return strategy in juveniles to slow return stress-re-
sistant strategy in adults and that this strategy shift is driven by modifications in 
foliage biomass investments in support and photosynthetic functions as well as by 
varying mesophyll diffusional controls on photosynthesis. Changes in needle mor-
phophysiotype during tree and needle ageing need consideration in predicting 
changes in tree photosynthetic potentials through tree ontogeny and during and 
among growing seasons.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Profound modifications in foliage structural and photosynthetic 
traits occur with increases in tree age and size (Day, Greenwood, 
& White, 2001; Mediavilla, Herranz, González-­Zurdo, & Escudero, 
2014; Niinemets, 2002; Niinemets & Kull, 1995; Steppe, Niinemets, 
& Teskey, 2011; Woodruff, Meinzer, Lachenbruch, & Johnson, 2009). 
Particularly large trait alterations occur upon juvenile-­to-­adult tran-
sition, a change called heteroblasty (Zotz, Wilhelm, & Becker, 2011). 
Heteroblastic modifications in foliage morphology are especially 
large in pine species (Boddi, Bonzi, & Calamassi, 2002; Climent, San-­
Martín, Chambel, & Mutke, 2011; Kuusk, Niinemets, & Valladares, 
2018b; Mediavilla et al., 2014; Pardos, Calama, & Climent, 2009). 
Juvenile (primary) pine needles are solitary and have different 
cross-­sectional shape, ellipsoidal or rhomboidal, compared to adult 
(secondary) needles that have semi-­elliptical (two-­needled species) 
or sectorial (species with three or more needles in fascicles) shape 
(Climent, Aranda, Alonso, Pardos, & Gil, 2006; Kuusk et al., 2018b). 
In addition, needle linear dimensions, thickness and width, and 
needle dry mass per unit area are typically lower in juvenile nee-
dles (Boddi et al., 2002; Kuusk et al., 2018b; Mediavilla et al., 2014; 
Pardos et al., 2009).
Despite lower needle cross-­sectional area, juvenile needles 
have greater net assimilation rates on both needle area and dry 
mass basis (Niinemets, 2002), but the mechanisms responsible for 
greater juvenile needle photosynthesis have not yet been fully re-
solved. Previous research has indicated that photosynthesis in older 
and larger conifer trees is more severely limited by stomatal con-
ductance, albeit larger trees also have lower foliage biochemical 
photosynthesis potentials, maximum carboxylase activity of Rubisco 
(Vcmax) and the capacity for photosynthetic electron transport (Jmax) 
(Day et al., 2001; Niinemets, 2002; Räim, Kaurilind, Hallik, & Merilo, 
2012; Steppe et al., 2011; Woodruff et al., 2009). It has further been 
suggested that photosynthesis in structurally more robust needles in 
older and larger trees is more strongly limited by mesophyll diffusion 
conductance from substomatal cavities to chloroplasts due to longer 
effective diffusion path lengths (Niinemets, 2002), but the experi-
mental support to this hypothesis is lacking (Niinemets, Díaz-­Espejo, 
Flexas, Galmés, & Warren, 2009 for a review).
The concept of leaf economics spectrum describes coordinated 
variations in leaf structure and physiological activity through high 
return lavish strategy to conservative low return stress-­tolerant 
strategy focusing on three main traits (“core traits”), leaf dry mass 
per unit area, nitrogen content and photosynthetic capacity (Wright, 
FI G U R E 1 Variation in the maximum carboxylase activity of Rubisco (Vcmax; a, c) and the capacity for photosynthetic electron transport 
(Jmax; b, d) expressed per unit needle dry mass (a, b) and projected needle area (c, d) as driven by needle and tree age in three Mediterranean 
Pinus species. Vcmax and Jmax were derived from net assimilation (A) vs. chloroplastic CO2 (Cc)–response curves. n = 4–6 for each leaf 
age × species combination. Table 1 shows corresponding values of net assimilation rate (A) and mesophyll diffusion conductance (gm). Needle 
age codes as: juv—juvenile (primary) current year; m0—mature (secondary) current year; m1—mature 1-­year-­old; m2—mature 2-­year-­old 
needles. The juvenile needles were studied in 2-­year-­old 0.2-­ to 0.3-­m-­tall young plants, and the secondary needles in 15-­ to 21-­m-­tall 
cone-­bearing mature trees. Different letters denote statistical significance of average values for different species and needle age class 
combinations at p < .05 (one-­way ANOVA followed by a Tukey post hoc test). According to two-­way ANOVA comparing juvenile and adult 
current-­year needles in different species, tree age effect was significant for a, b and c, species effect for b and d, and tree age × species 
interaction was not significant in any of the relationships. According to two-­way ANOVA comparing adult needle ages in different species, 
needle age was significant in all cases, species effect for c and d, and needle age × species interaction was not significant in any of the cases 
(Table 1 for details of the two-­way ANOVA models)

KUUSK et al.
Reich, et al., 2004). The economics spectrum relationships have 
been developed by pooling plants with varying age (Kattge et al., 
2011;). So far, possible implications of juvenile-­to-­adult transition 
on leaf trait relationships have not been explored and the traits in 
seedlings and adult plants are considered as parts of the same gen-
eral economics spectrum. However, there is a strategy shift from 
juvenile physiologically active and less stress-­tolerant strategy to 
adult more sclerophyllous higher stress tolerance strategy (Climent, 
San-­Martín, et al., 2011; Harper, 1989; Karban & Thaler, 1999; Kuusk 
et al., 2018b; Mediavilla et al., 2014; Pardos et al., 2009), suggest-
ing that heteroblastic changes could alter the trait relationships. 
Mesophyll diffusion conductance and fractional tissue distribution 
do not belong to the “core” traits of the leaf economics spectrum as 
initially defined (Wright, Reich, et al., 2004), but they both can alter 
foliage photosynthetic capacity at given leaf dry mass per unit area 
and nitrogen content. Existence of a trade-­off between structural 
and photosynthetic functions could mean that leaf photosynthetic 
capacity changes more at a given dry mass per unit area and nitro-
gen content than predicted by the broadleaf economics spectrum 
relationships.
We studied modifications in foliage photosynthetic character-
istics upon juvenile-­to-­adult transition in three Mediterranean pine 
species—Pinus halepensis Mill., P. pinea L. and P. nigra J. F. Arnold 
subsp. salzmannii (Dunal) Franco. Differently from European pines 
in wetter climates where juvenile needles are present in up to 
1-­year-­old seedlings, young Mediterranean pines typically carry 
juvenile needles longer, for 2–3 years (Climent, San-­Martín, et al.,

KUUSK et al.
2011), suggesting that heteroblastic differences constitute an im-
portant seedling adaptation in Mediterranean highly stressful en-
vironments. We have previously reported that juvenile needles 
have lower needle density, greater fraction of mesophyll tissue in 
needles, thinner mesophyll cell walls and greater chloroplast to ex-
posed mesophyll cell wall surface area, while secondary needles in 
adult trees are characterized by the opposite suite of these traits 
(Kuusk et al., 2018b). Here, we hypothesized that these trait dif-
ferences result in concomitant variations in needle photosynthetic 
capacity and that the alteration in needle photosynthetic potentials 
is driven by the trade-­off between support and photosynthetic in-
vestments demonstrated in Kuusk et al. (2018b), and furthermore, 
that the greater structural robustness in adult needles is associated 
with a stronger limitation of photosynthesis by mesophyll diffusion 
conductance.
Needle age also influences foliage structural traits and nutrient 
content (Mediavilla et al., 2014; Niinemets, 2002; Niinemets, García-­
Plazaola, & Tosens, 2012; Teskey, Grier, & Hinckley, 1984; Weiskittel, 
Temesgen, Wilson, & Maguire, 2008), but the effects of these mod-
ifications on age-­dependent changes in needle photosynthetic po-
tentials are still not fully resolved. Thus, in mature trees we studied 
variation in foliage photosynthetic potentials in non-­senescent adult 
current-­year, 1-­year-­old and 2-­year-­old needles. We hypothesized 
that the age-­dependent changes in photosynthetic activity with 
needle age are also driven by changes in mesophyll conductance and 
accumulation of support tissues, but that trait changes with nee-
dle age are comparatively less extensive than modifications upon 
juvenile-­to-­adult transition.
2 | MATERIAL AND METHODS
2.1 | Measurement sites and plant sampling
Full details of study sites, plants and plant sampling are provided 
in Kuusk et al. (2018b). In short, the study was conducted in sites 
with continental Mediterranean climate characterized by hot 
dry summers and relatively cold dry winters. Adult cone-­bearing 
trees were investigated at Alto Tajo Natural Park, Central Spain 
(Guadalajara, Castilla-­La Mancha, 40.8480°N, 2.1812°W, mean el-
evation 950 m). The mean annual rainfall at the site is 490 mm and 
mean annual temperature 10.2°C (Molina de Aragón whether sta-
tion, 40.8444°N, 1.8853°W, elevation 1,063 m). In each species, five 
mature plants at full sunlight were randomly selected for sampling. 
The trees were 90–100 years old and 15–21 m tall (Kuusk et al., 
2018b for species averages). Terminal branchlets without cones (one 
branch from each individual tree) were taken from the southern part 
of the upper canopy (average seasonal integrated quantum flux den-
sity of ca. 40 mol m−2 day−1) to minimize shading effects on foliage 
characteristics (Gebauer et al., 2011; Niinemets, Keenan, & Hallik, 
2015) in October 2005 and in August 2006. The branches were cut 
under water, and the cut ends were kept in water and transported 
to the laboratory for gas-­exchange and anatomical measurements. 
Previous studies have indicated that use of cut branches allows for 
obtaining representative estimates of foliage gas-­exchange char-
acteristics, except stomatal conductance that can differ from the 
values in the field (e.g., Niinemets, Cescatti, Rodeghiero, & Tosens, 
2005; Peñuelas et al., 2010).
There were very few seedlings at the field site, as is common 
in Mediterranean forests, and the seedlings in the understorey of 
mature trees were shaded and no recent clear-­cut or disturbed 
areas were available. Therefore, to study juvenile foliage, 2-­year-­old 
juvenile trees were obtained from a local nursery at El Seranillo 
Forestry Center, Guadalajara. They were grown in 5-­L pots filled 
with a mixture (4:4:1:1, v/v) of compost, vermiculite, perlite and 
sand at the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales (CSIC) in Madrid, 
Spain (40.440°N, 3.690°W, elevation 682 m). The pots were buried 
in the soil such that pot soil temperature was ambient, and were 
exposed to full sunlight (average daily integrated photosynthetic 
quantum flux density of 41 mol m−2 day−1). For the measurements, 
current-­year juvenile foliage formed in the new growth conditions 
was used. Obviously, the current experimental design introduces 
unknown sources of variation due to somewhat different growth

inherent to comparisons of different sized and aged plants. Kuusk 
et al. (2018b) provide a thorough discussion of potential disadvan-
tages and advantages of our design. Because foliage shading is quan-
titatively the most important environmental factor affecting leaf 
structure and function (Niinemets et al., 2015; Keenan & Niinemets, 
2016; Poorter, Niinemets, Poorter, Niinemets, Poorter, Wright, & 
Villar, 2009), we considered our design more appropriate than the 
alternative of comparing high light exposed adult and shaded under-
storey juvenile plants. We note that the experimental design used 
here is analogous to studies carried out along the chronosequence of 
different stands and is also appropriate from an ecological perspec-
tive as shade-­intolerant Mediterranean pine seedlings cannot persist 
in the understorey, and can reach the canopy only once a major gap 
forms in the canopy (Climent, San-­Martín, et al., 2011; Kuusk et al., 
2018b).
In adult trees carrying secondary needles, current-­year, 1-­year-­old 
and 2-­year-­old needles were measured, except for P. halepensis that 
supported only two needle age classes due to shorter needle life 
span. In the juveniles, where the canopy was chiefly made up of 
primary current-­year needles, only primary needles formed at the 
growth conditions were studied. In 2005, five juvenile plants, and 
four to five branches from adult trees from each studied species 
were measured for foliage photosynthesis characteristics. In 2006, 
additional branches from adult trees were measured: two branches 
from P. halepensis, three branches from P. pinea and three branches 
from P. nigra. In total, 24 branches from adult trees (from eight trees 
of each species) and 15 juvenile plants (five of each species) were 
used. Thus, for each tree age × leaf age × species combination, alto-
gether four to six samples (on average 5.2) were measured.
2.2 | Needle gas-­exchange measurements
Gas-­exchange measurements were carried out with a Li-­Cor 6400 
portable gas-­exchange system (Version 5; Li-­Cor, Inc., Lincoln, NE, 
USA) using the 2-­cm2 leaf chamber fluorimeter measurement head. 
Needles were enclosed side by side to avoid overlap between the 
needles and standard environmental conditions of chamber block 
temperature of 25°C, ambient CO2 concentration of 400 μmol/mol, 
quantum flux density of 2,200 μmol m−2 s−1 (10% blue light) were es-
tablished, and the leaves were conditioned in the chamber until sto-
mata opened and steady-­state gas-­exchange rates were established, 
typically in 30 min after needle enclosure. After reaching the steady 
state, the CO2–response curve was measured first, followed by the 
light–response curve. In the case of the CO2–response curve, am-
bient CO2 concentrations were prepared in sequence of 400, 600, 
900, 1,200, 1,600, 200, 300, 200 and 50 μmol/mol and steady-­state 
rates of net assimilation were recorded at each CO2 concentration. 
In the case of the light–response curve, light intensity was changed 
in the sequence of 1,200, 1,800, 800, 500, 250, 125, 80, 30 and 
0 μmol m−2 s−1 and again steady-­state rates at each light level were 
recorded. At the end of the measurements, light was switched off 
and the rate of dark respiration was measured when the cuvette 
temperature stabilized and leaf gas-­exchange reached a steady state, 
typically in 4–5 min after switching off the light. At each CO2 and 
light level, a saturating light flash of 6,800 μmol m−2 s−1 was given to 
estimate the effective quantum yield of photosystem II:
where Fmʹ  is the maximum and Fs the steady-­state fluorescence yield 
of light-­adapted leaves (Genty, Briantais, & Baker, 1989). From these 
measurements, the rate of photosynthetic electron transport from 
chlorophyll fluorescence, JETR, was calculated as:
where Q is the quantum flux density and ζ is the leaf absorptance 
(an average value of 0.9 was used in this study in accordance with 
estimates of quantum yields obtained from light–response curves).
2.3 | Estimations of Farquhar, von 
Caemmerer, and Berry (1980) photosynthesis model 
characteristics and mesophyll conductance
Before calculation of foliage gas-­exchange rates, the data were 
corrected for CO2 and water vapour diffusion leaks according to 
Rodeghiero, Niinemets, and Cescatti (2007) using diffusion leak coeffi-
cients of 0.445 μmol/s for CO2 and 5.11 μmol/s for water vapour. After 
diffusion corrections, all gas-­exchange rates were calculated according 
to von Caemmerer and Farquhar (1981) using the leaf areas estimated 
from leaf anatomical measurements as detailed in the next section 
(between 1.5 and 2 cm2 projected leaf area was included in the leaf 
chamber). Farquhar et al. (1980) model of photosynthesis was first fit-
ted to net assimilation (A) vs. intercellular CO2 (Ci)–response curves and 
the apparent values of the maximum carboxylase activity of ribulose-­
1,5-­bisophosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco, Vcmax,Ci) and the 
capacity for photosynthetic electron transport (Jmax,Ci) were estimated 
as in Niinemets et al. (2005) using the Rubisco kinetic characteristics 
from Bernacchi, Singsaas, Pimentel, Portis, and Long (2001).
Based on gas-­exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence measure-
ments (Harley, Loreto, di Marco, & Sharkey, 1992), mesophyll diffu-
sion conductance to CO2 was estimated as:
where Γ* is the hypothetical CO2 compensation point in the absence 
of dark respiration and Rd is the non-­mitochondrial respiration rate 
in light (taken as half of the dark respiration rate, e.g., Way & Yamori, 
2014; Niinemets, 2014). Using the values of gm, chloroplastic CO2 
concentrations corresponding to each Ci value were calculated as 
Cc = Ci-­A/gm and A vs. Cc–response curves were obtained. Farquhar 
et al. (1980) photosynthesis model was re-­fitted to these data, and 
Cc-­based estimates of foliage photosynthetic potentials (Vcmax,Cc) and 
Jmax,Cc) were determined.
As at the given chamber block temperature, leaf temperatures 
varied somewhat (between 24 and 30°C), both Ci-­ and Cc-­based

KUUSK et al.
estimates of foliage biochemical potentials were standardized to a 
common temperature of 25°C using the shape of the specific ac-
tivity of Rubisco of Niinemets and Tenhunen (1997) for Vcmax, and 
the shape of Jmax temperature–response curve characteristic to 
Mediterranean species (temperature optimum of 39.7°C, Niinemets 
et al., 2002). As Vcmax and Jmax calculated from Ci and Cc curves were 
strongly correlated (r2 = .82 for Vcmax and r2 = .92 for Jmax, p < .001 
for both), we only demonstrate data for Cc-­based estimates.
Branch-­to-­branch differences in leaf temperature were also 
associated with a certain variation in vapour pressure deficit (1.41–
2.82 kPa, average ± SE = 2.050 ± 0.013 kPa) and degree of stomatal 
limitation of photosynthesis (as evident in a certain variation in Ci 
values at the reference ambient CO2 concentrations common in ex-
periments using cut twigs). Thus, the parameterized Farquhar et al. 
(1980) photosynthesis model was used to obtain standardized es-
timates of leaf net assimilation rates independent of stomatal con-
ductance at a Ci value of 250 μmol/mol as in Niinemets, Wright, and 
Evans (2009).
2.4 | Calculation of leaf area enclosed in the 
gas-­exchange cuvette and foliage chemical and 
structural data
After photosynthesis measurements, needles enclosed in the gas-­
exchange cuvette were harvested and total needle length (L), the 
length of enclosed needle section (LE), width (W) and thickness 
(T) were measured with Starrett Digital callipers (model 727, L. S. 
Starrett Company, Athol, MA, USA). From these measurements, av-
erage needle projected area, SP, was calculated as WL, and needle 
projected area enclosed in the chamber as the sum of the products 
LEW of individual needles enclosed in the chamber (
i=n
∑
i=1
LE,iWi, where n 
is the number of needles enclosed in the chamber).
Measurements of needle volume (V), total to projected area ratio 
(ST/SP), dry mass per unit projected (MA,P) and total (MA,T) needle area, 
density (D, needle volume per dry mass), volume to projected area ratio, 
V/SP, dry to fresh mass ratio, RD/F, nitrogen content per unit projected 
(NA,P) and total (NA,T) needle area, tissue volume fractions in support 
(volume fractions in epidermis, hypodermis and central cylinder) and 
photosynthetic mesophyll, and needle ultrastructural characteristics 
are described in Kuusk et al. (2018b). Foliage photosynthetic charac-
teristics per total area were calculated as the values per projected area 
divided by ST/SP. Needle photosynthetic characteristics per dry mass 
were calculated as the values expressed per projected area divided by 
MA,P. Area-­ and mass-­based physiological traits characterize different 
facets of leaf functioning. Dry mass-­based foliage photosynthetic po-
tentials characterize the photosynthetic return on biomass investment 
in leaves, and area-­based capacities indicate the integrated outcome 
of differences in leaf structure and photosynthetic capacity of single 
mesophyll cells (Niinemets & Sack, 2006; Onoda et al., 2017; Wright, 
Reich, et al., 2004). Expressions of gm per area and dry mass both char-
acterize the extent to which CO2 diffusion from intercellular air space 
to chloroplasts limits photosynthesis, but given that both intercellu-
lar and chloroplastic CO2 concentrations are leaf volume-­weighted 
estimates, diffusion limitations generally scale more strongly with gm 
per dry mass (Niinemets, Díaz-­Espejo, et al., 2009).
2.5 | Statistical analyses
Differences in average trait values among study years, needle ages 
and among adult and juvenile trees were tested by ANOVA followed 
by Tukey’s post hoc tests with statistica 6 (StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, USA) 
and R 3.1.1 with default packages (R Development Core Team, 2012) 
as in Kuusk et al. (2018b). As the year of study was not significant in 
any of the analyses, it was removed from the final analyses. Two-­way 
ANOVAs were used to test for effects of species and heteroblasty 
among current-­year needles, and effects of species and needle age 
among adult needles. Relationships among leaf traits were explored 
by linear (Pearson) correlation and nonlinear regression analyses. 
All statistical effects were considered significant at p < .05. The 
data accompanying this article are available from the Dryad Digital 
Repository (Kuusk, Niinemets, & Valladares, 2018a).
3 | RESULTS
3.1 | Tree and needle age, and species-­dependent 
changes in needle photosynthetic characteristics
Foliage net assimilation rate per unit dry mass (Am) was greater for 
juvenile than for adult current-­year needles (Table 1). Net assimila-
tion rate per unit projected area (AP), the product of needle dry mass 
per projected area (MA,P) and Am was less variable, but juvenile nee-
dles nevertheless had a greater AP when all species were analysed 
together (Table 1). Analogously to Am, nitrogen use efficiency (the 
ratio of Am to Nm, EN) was significantly greater in juvenile than in 
adult current-­year needles (Table 1).
Analysis of needle biochemical potentials, maximum carboxylase 
activity of Rubisco (Vcmax) and photosynthetic electron transport (Jmax) 
derived from the net assimilation vs. chloroplastic CO2 (Cc)–response 
curves indicated that juvenile needles had greater Vcmax and Jmax per 
unit dry mass than adult current-­year needles (Figure 1a,b for species-­
specific differences and Figure S1A,B in Supporting Information for 
all species pooled). The estimate of photosynthetic electron transport 
rate from chlorophyll fluorescence (JETR, Equation 2) per dry mass was 
also greater for juvenile that for adult current-­year needles (p < .001). 
Again, Vcmax and Jmax per unit projected area varied less (Figures 1c,d, 
and S1D,E), but Jmax per unit projected area was greater in juvenile 
than in adult current-­year needles (Figures 1d and S1E).
Mesophyll diffusion conductance (gm) was greater in juvenile 
than in adult current-­year needles when expressed both per unit dry 
mass and projected area (Table 1, Figure S1C,F). The CO2 drawdown 
from substomatal cavities to chloroplasts, Ci-­Cc, was lower for juve-
nile than for adult current-­year needles (Table 1, Figure S1C).
Analysis of the needle age effects on adult needles across all spe-
cies indicated that foliage net assimilation rates, foliage biochemical 
potentials, Vcmax and Jmax, and gm both per unit dry mass and area, 
and nitrogen use efficiency generally decreased with increasing

needle age (Figures 1 and S1, Table 1). Needle age effects on CO2 
drawdown were less, but still significant (Table 1, Figure S1C).
Both tree age and needle age-­dependent modifications oc-
curred similarly in all species (no significant species × tree age and 
species × needle age interactions, Figure 1 and Table 1), but species 
differed in average values of some photosynthetic traits (EN, Jmax per 
unit area and dry mass for current-­year juvenile and adult needles, 
and Am, AP, and area-­based gm, Vcmax and Jmax for different-­aged adult 
needles; Figure 1 and Table 1). This mainly reflected superior photo-
synthetic characteristics in P. nigra (Figure 1 and Table 1).
3.2 | Correlations of leaf photosynthetic 
characteristics with leaf structural and chemical traits
Foliage net assimilation rate and underlying partial determinants, EN, 
Vcmax, Jmax and gm, scaled positively with needle mesophyll volume 
fraction (measured as the fraction of needle mesophyll in needle 
cross-­section) and negatively with volume fractions of mechanical 
tissues (Figure 2a,b; Table 2), whereas the correlations were stronger 
for mass-­based photosynthetic characteristics (Table 2; r2 = .26 for 
Vcmax and r2 = .36 for Jmax expressed per unit area vs. total mesophyll 
fraction, p < .001 for both). Needle traits characterizing leaf struc-
tural robustness, MA,P, density (D) and volume to projected surface 
area ratio (V/SP; MA,P = DV/SP, and needle dry to fresh mass ratio 
(RD/F) were generally also negatively associated with both area-­ and 
mass-­based Vcmax and Jmax (p < .01 for all, except for Vcmax per area 
vs. D, p > .07). Again, these negative relationships were stronger for 
mass-­based (Table 2; for the four structural traits, average r2 = .35 
for relationships with Vcmax and r2 = .40 for relationships with Jmax) 
than for area-­based (Table 2; average r2 = .15 for relationships with 
Vcmax and r2 = .25 for relationships with Jmax) Vcmax and Jmax.
There were weak positive correlations of mass-­based foliage 
photosynthetic characteristics, A, gm (Table 2) and Vcmax (Figure 3a) 
and Jmax (Figure 3b), with foliage nitrogen content per dry mass. 
However, the correlations of area-­based characteristics with nitro-
gen content per area were even non-­significant or negative (Table 2; 
Figure 3c,d). In fact, photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency was a 
stronger determinant of net assimilation rate than nitrogen content 
(Am = ENNm and AP = ENNA,P; r = .92 for Am vs. EN and r = .71 for AP 
vs. EN, p < .001 for both). Higher nitrogen use efficiency was asso-
ciated with enhanced mesophyll diffusion conductance (r = .83 for 
mass-­based gm vs. EN and r = .68, for area-­based gm vs. EN, p < .001 
for both).
4 | DISCUSSION
4.1 | Heteroblastic changes in needle 
photosynthesis
The results of this study collectively demonstrate important differ-
ences in foliage photosynthetic potentials and mesophyll conduct-
ance among juvenile and different-­aged adult needles and that these 
differences primarily result from modifications in needle structure 
and the share of support and assimilative tissues. Although for the 
current dataset, heteroblasty only weakly affected needle nitrogen 
content per dry mass (Kuusk et al., 2018b), foliage net assimilation 
rate per dry mass standardized to a common intercellular CO2 con-
centration (Am) was strongly enhanced, 2.4-­ to 2.7-­fold in the juvenile 
needles of the three pine species studied (Table 1). Net assimila-
tion rate per projected area (AP), the product of Am and needle dry 
mass per unit projected area (MA,P), was also moderately greater in 
juvenile needles (Table 1), indicating that the heteroblastic changes 
in mass-­based photosynthetic capacity, both due to changes in tis-
sue distribution between assimilative and structural tissues and in 
photosynthetic capacity of individual mesophyll cells, were quan-
titatively greater than needle biomass accumulation per area. An 
enhanced assimilation rate per unit foliage biomass implies that the 
juvenile foliage has a shorter time to pay back the carbon cost used 
for foliage construction. Thus, juveniles have a greater carbon avail-
ability for growth of new biomass, thereby importantly contributing 
to their early growth and recruitment (Climent, Chambel, Pardos, 
Lario, & Villar-­Salvador, 2011; Climent, San-­Martín, et al., 2011; 
Mediavilla et al., 2014).
Similarly to the current study, a decrease of Am with increasing 
tree age and size has been consistently observed in conifers (Day 
et al., 2001; Mediavilla et al., 2014; Miller, Eddleman, & Miller, 1995; 
Niinemets, 2002; Räim et al., 2012; Steppe et al., 2011; Woodruff 
et al., 2009). As observed in our study (Figure 3), this decrease is often 
associated with much lower variation in foliage nitrogen content per 
dry mass among different-­aged and sized trees (Day et al., 2001; 
Juárez-­López, Escudero, & Mediavilla, 2008; Mediavilla et al., 2014; 
Niinemets, 2002). Area-­based net assimilation rate also typically de-
creases with increasing tree age and size in conifers (Day et al., 2001; 
Greenwood, Ward, Day, Adams, & Bond, 2008; Niinemets, 2002; 
Räim et al., 2012; Steppe et al., 2011), but as also observed in our 
study (Table 1), the decrease is typically less than in the mass-­based 
rate. Furthermore, quantitatively, heteroblastic modifications in foli-
age photosynthesis rate are much greater than changes in mass-­ and 
area-­based photosynthesis rates due to the gradual ontogenetic drift 
in mature plants (our study vs., e.g., Niinemets, 2002; Räim et al., 
2012; Steppe et al., 2011; Woodruff et al., 2009).
It has been suggested that the reduction in the assimilation 
rate in older trees reflects mainly changes in stomatal conduc-
tance (Greenwood et al., 2008; Yoder, Ryan, Waring, Schoettle, & 
Kaufmann, 1994), but there is evidence that the reduction in sto-
matal conductance is not the only factor responsible for the de-
cline in photosynthesis rate with tree age (Niinemets, 2002; Räim 
et al., 2012). In fact, older plants might have an even greater stoma-
tal conductance, but still reduced photosynthesis rate (Day et al., 
2001). As our study demonstrated, higher net assimilation rate at a 
given intercellular CO2 concentration in juvenile needles was asso-
ciated both with enhanced biochemical photosynthesis capacities, 
Vcmax and Jmax (Figures 1 and S1), and enhanced mesophyll diffusion 
conductance (gm, Table 1, Figure S1) that affects net assimilation 
rate by altering the chloroplastic CO2 concentration (Cc). Mesophyll 
conductance and foliage photosynthetic capacity can vary in a

coordinated manner such that the CO2 drawdown from substo-
matal cavities to chloroplasts, Ci-­Cc = A/gm, is invariable (Evans & 
Loreto, 2000). However, this is typically not the case across species 
with varying structure, and Ci-­Cc is often greater, and accordingly, 
gm-­limitation of photosynthesis is more severe in species with more 
robust foliage structure (Onoda et al., 2017; Tomás et al., 2013; 
Tosens, Niinemets, Westoby, & Wright, 2012; Veromann, Tosens, 
Laanisto, & Niinemets, 2017). Our study demonstrated that Ci-­Cc 
was lower in juvenile needles (Table 1, Figure S1), indicating that the 
mesophyll diffusion limited the rate of photosynthesis to a lower 
extent in juvenile needles. Such a lower control of photosynthe-
sis by gm and accordingly, a greater efficiency of use of resources 
invested in photosynthetic machinery in younger plants has been 
hypothesized (Niinemets, 2002), but to our knowledge, this had 
not yet been experimentally confirmed. At the ultrastructural level, 
greater gm-­limitation of photosynthesis in adult trees was associ-
ated with thicker cell walls in P. nigra and P. pinea and with lower 
chloroplast to exposed mesophyll surface area ratio in P. halepensis 
(Kuusk et al., 2018b), indicating that the effective diffusion path-
way lengths were indeed greater in secondary needles in adult trees 
than in primary needles in young trees.
Given the frequent and severe drought and temperature stress 
conditions in Mediterranean environments and sustained biotic 
stress pressure, the lack of foliage robustness can be a significant 
limitation to survival of juvenile plants and can explain why success-
ful seedling establishment in Mediterranean conditions can occur 
only in favourable years with moderate stress conditions (Braza 
& García, 2011; Prévosto, Gavinet, Ripert, & Fernandez, 2015). 
Therefore, we suggest that the main advantage of juvenile needles 
is more effective photosynthesis, which provides the young seed-
ling with necessary carbon building blocks for establishing exten-
sive root systems and later on for development of more durable 
adult needles which are more resistant to mechanical stress and 
more tolerant to drought.
4.2 | Modifications in foliage photosynthetic 
characteristics with needle age
Older needles of the three studied pine species had significantly 
lower photosynthesis rate per unit needle dry mass and area 
(Table 1). The reduction in mass-­based photosynthesis rate is a 
characteristic age-­dependent change (Oleksyn et al., 1997; Teskey 
et al., 1984), but there is a variability in the age-­dependent changes 
in area-­based photosynthesis (Jensen, Warren, Hanson, Childs, & 
Wullschleger, 2015; Niinemets, 2002; Tissue, Griffin, Turnbull, & 
Whitehead, 2001). This variability is driven by differences in how 
the components of AP vary with leaf age. For the current dataset, 
the relative magnitude of the age effects on Am (1.7-­2-­fold reduction 
in our study, Table 1) was greater than on dry mass per unit area 
(1.1-­ to 1.3-­fold increase for MA,P) (Kuusk et al., 2018b), resulting in a 
significant reduction in AP with leaf age (Table 1).
The age-­dependent reduction in Am has been associated with 
a decrease in foliage nitrogen content per dry mass (Oleksyn et al., 
1997) that is expected to lead to concomitant reductions in the fo-
liage photosynthetic potentials Vcmax and Jmax (Ethier, Livingston, 
Harrison, Black, & Moran, 2006; Warren, 2006). Although changes 
in needle age were primarily associated with reductions in foliage 
biochemical potentials in our study (Figures 1 and S1A–D), the age 
effects on foliage nitrogen content were not significant (Kuusk et al., 
2018b) in agreement with several other studies demonstrating mod-
erate or minor differences in Nm in needles of different age (Ethier 
et al., 2006; Warren, 2006). A reduction in Vcmax and Jmax at given 
Nm might reflect a change in the share of foliage nitrogen distribu-
tion between photosynthetic and structural functions (e.g., Warren 
& Adams, 2000). Especially in sclerophyllous species, a large fraction 
of foliage nitrogen is associated with cell walls (Dong et al., 2015; 
Hikosaka & Shigeno, 2009; Onoda et al., 2017; Takashima, Hikosaka, 
& Hirose, 2004), and given the age-­dependent reduction in Vcmax 
and Jmax observed in our study, it is likely that this fraction increased 
with increasing leaf structural robustness in ageing needles. It has 
also been suggested that Rubisco becomes progressively inactivated 
with increasing needle age, explaining partly the age-­dependent re-
duction in Vcmax (Ethier et al., 2006; Warren, 2006).
Increases in leaf age also resulted in a reduction in mesophyll 
diffusion conductance (Table 1, Figure S1C,F) as observed in sev-
eral evergreen species (Ethier et al., 2006; Niinemets et al., 2005; 
Warren, 2006). Given that the decrease in gm was associated with 
concomitant increases in the CO2 drawdown Ci-­Cc (Table 1, Figure 
S1C), reduced gm indeed limited photosynthesis more in older leaves. 
Such a greater limitation of photosynthesis by within-­leaf diffusion in 
older leaves has been observed previously in several Mediterranean 
broadleaved evergreen species (Niinemets et al., 2005). Lower gm 
in older needles in our study was associated with longer diffusion 
pathways due to increases in needle cross-­sectional dimensions 
and lower chloroplast to exposed mesophyll surface area (Kuusk 
et al., 2018b), and possibly also with lower cell wall porosity of more 
strongly lignified cell walls in older needles.
4.3 | The implications of the trade-­offs between 
structural and functional investments for foliage 
photosynthesis
In addition to greater gm-­limitation, more robust secondary needles 
in mature trees had a lower needle volume fraction in photosyn-
thetic mesophyll (Kuusk et al., 2018b). Such a difference was directly 
associated with foliage photosynthetic capacity across all data, as 
the fractional investment in mesophyll was strongly correlated with 
foliage net assimilation rate (Table 2). Furthermore, the positive cor-
relations with mesophyll volume fraction and foliage photosynthetic 
potentials (Figure 2) suggest that needles with greater mesophyll 
volume fraction indeed had greater concentrations of photosynthe-
sizing enzymes.
The mass-­based photosynthesis rate varied more among juve-
nile and adult needles (2.3–2.7-­fold, Table 1) than the mesophyll 
volume fraction (1.3–1.5-­fold, Kuusk et al., 2018b), partly reflecting 
concomitant changes in mesophyll diffusion conductance with tree

age (Table 1). Nevertheless, the photosynthetic potentials (Vcmax and 
Jmax; Figures 1a,b and S1A,B) that are not directly affected by gm also 
varied somewhat more than mesophyll volume fraction. Given the 
moderate increase of Nm with increasing mesophyll volume faction 
(Kuusk et al., 2018b), a greater variation in Vcmax and Jmax suggests 
a positive scaling of nitrogen investments in photosynthetic ma-
chinery with mesophyll volume fraction. Indeed, a strong positive 
correlation was observed between mesophyll volume fraction and 
nitrogen use efficiency (Table 2).
Species differences in adult needle photosynthesis were small 
in our study (Table 1), indicating that the moderate species variation 
in mesophyll volume fraction did not affect needle photosynthetic 
activity to a large extent. This suggests a certain compensation 
resulting from species differences in nitrogen content, P. halepen-
sis < P. nigra ≤ P. halepensis (Kuusk et al., 2018b) and in nitrogen use 
efficiency (Table 1).
4.4 | Weak relationships of foliage photosynthetic 
characteristics with nitrogen content
Leaf economics spectrum (Wright, Reich, et al., 2004) is a concept 
describing the covariation of suites of leaf traits across the whole 
range of strategies from a low return stress-­tolerant (low Am and Nm, 
high MA) to a high return, luxurious (high Am and Nm, low MA) strat-
egy. The three most prominent relationships in the leaf economics 
spectrum are the positive correlation between Am and Nm and nega-
tive correlations between Am and MA, and Nm and MA (Wright, Reich, 
et al., 2004). Across all the data in our study, the negative correlation 
between Am and MA,P was highly significant (Table 2), but Am and Nm 
were weakly correlated and the correlations of Nm vs. MA,P and MA,T 
were not significant. It has been suggested that due to inherent in-
ter-­ and intraspecific variability, broad relationships might not simply 
be evident within datasets covering only part of the economics spec-
trum, for example, within the data coming from the low or fast return 
ends of the economics spectrum (Reich, 1993; Wright, Groom, et al., 
2004). On the other hand, it has been argued that different combi-
nations of traits can drive vegetation performance in different parts 
of the economics spectrum, and thus, although contrasting, “local” 
relationships can have important functional implications (Diemer, 
Körner, & Prock, 1992; Niinemets, 2015).
The Mediterranean pines studied here are located at the low 
return end of the economics spectrum, but nevertheless, varia-
tion in foliage photosynthetic capacity, leaf structure and nitrogen 
content was extensive (Kuusk et al., 2018b; Table 1). However, 
needle age-­ and plant age-­dependent variations within this data-
set primarily affected Am and MA,P and MA,T and much less Nm, and 
the key trait explaining the variation of Am at given Nm was the 
nitrogen use efficiency which reflects nitrogen distribution among 
photosynthetically active and non-­active leaf functions and the 
efficiency with which photosynthetic proteins are engaged, that 
is, mesophyll conductance and the degree of activation of rate-­
limiting proteins (Onoda et al., 2017). Both the heteroblastic 
change and needle ageing were associated with lower fractions of 
nitrogen invested in photosynthetic functions and reduced meso-
phyll conductance in structurally more robust needles (Table 1). 
In fact, from global databases, there is evidence that the fraction 
of nitrogen invested in the photosynthetic machinery and the 
slope of Nm vs. Am relationships decreases with increasing leaf me-
chanical robustness (Niinemets, 1999; Onoda et al., 2017; Reich, 
Kloeppel, Ellsworth, & Walters, 1995). These studies together with 
our observations suggest that leaf trait variation at the low re-
turn end of the economics spectrum can result in suites of trait 
combinations that might deviate from the universal relationships. 
This deviation uncovered here emphasizes the importance of tree 
and needle age and species effects in altering mesophyll diffusion 
conductance and distribution of nitrogen among photosynthetic 
and non-­photosynthetic functions, and ultimately foliage nitrogen 
use efficiency.
5 | CONCLUSIONS
This study highlights major differences in foliage photosynthetic 
characteristics among primary needles in young plants and sec-
ondary needles in mature plants and demonstrates that these dif-
ferences primarily result from differences in foliage structure. Less 
robust foliage of juvenile needles is associated with greater photo-
synthetic activity per unit biomass investment. This that contrib-
utes to enhanced growth and seedling establishment, whereas the 
advantage of greater mechanical robustness of secondary needles 
in adult trees is tolerance of harsh environmental conditions in the 
upper canopy. However, as this study demonstrates, the inherent 
trade-­off of greater mechanical resistance is a reduced fraction of 
needle biomass in photosynthetic tissues and lower mesophyll diffu-
sion conductance. As the result of greater diffusion limitations, any 
given nitrogen investment in photosynthetic machinery results in 
lower photosynthetic returns in more robust needles.
Tree age-­ and needle age-­dependent modifications in needle 
photosynthetic traits were qualitatively similar, indicating that in-
creasingly sclerophyllous needle structure in older trees and in age-
ing needles has the same basic effects on foliage photosynthesis. 
However, as hypothesized, age-­dependent changes in needle pho-
tosynthesis were less than differences due to tree age (Table 1), in-
dicating that juvenile-­to-­adult transition is a much more profound 
change in needle functioning.
It has been suggested that due to large evolutionary and plas-
tic modifications in foliar structure, structural limitations of foliar 
photosynthesis play at least as significant role as physiological and 
biochemical constraints (Niinemets & Sack, 2006). In the case of 
pine species studied here, heteroblasty and needle age, two charac-
teristic sources of trait variation in conifers, produced an extensive 
continuum of variation in photosynthetic and structural traits, but 
limited variation in foliage nitrogen content. This resulted in several 
trait relationships deviating from the global leaf economics spec-
trum, suggesting that increases in leaf robustness can alter foliage 
photosynthetic activity not only due to changes in tissue chemical
