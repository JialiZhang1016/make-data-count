Abstract El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the largest source of interannual climate variability on
Earth today; however, future ENSO remains difﬁcult to predict. Evaluation of paleo‐ENSO may help
improve our basic understanding of the phenomenon and help resolve discrepancies among
models tasked with simulating future climate. Individual foraminifera analysis allows
continuous down‐core records of ENSO‐related temperature variability through the construction and
comparison of paleotemperature distributions; however, there has been little focus on calibrating
this technique to modern conditions. Here, we present data from individual measurements of Mg/Ca in
two species of planktic foraminifera, surface dwelling Globigerinoides ruber and thermocline dwelling
Neogloboquadrina dutertrei, from nine core tops across the equatorial Paciﬁc (n ≈70 per core for
each species). Population variance, kernel probability density functions, and quantile‐quantile analyses
are used to evaluate the shape of each Mg/Ca‐temperature distribution and to compare them to modern
conditions using monthly temperatures from the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation. We show that
populations of individual Mg/Ca measurements in both G. ruber and N. dutertrei reﬂect site‐speciﬁc
temperature distribution shapes and variances across the equatorial Paciﬁc when accounting for regional
differences in depth habitats. Individual measurements of both taxa capture zonal increases in population
variance from the western equatorial Paciﬁc to the central equatorial Paciﬁc and a spatially
heterogeneous eastern equatorial Paciﬁc, consistent with modern conditions. Lastly, we show that
populations of individual Mg/Ca measurements are able to recover meaningful differences in
temperature variability between sites within the eastern equatorial Paciﬁc, lending support to this tool's
application for paleo‐ENSO reconstructions.
1. Introduction
El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is Earth's dominant mode of interannual climate variability. While
initiated in the tropical Paciﬁc, ENSO is responsible for widespread climatic, ecological, and societal
impacts, including increased rain and ﬂooding in coastal Ecuador and Peru and increased drought and ﬁres
in Indonesia during El Niño events. Despite the importance of ENSO for modern day climate variability and
its impacts on communities around the globe, future ENSO remains difﬁcult to predict. General circulation
models used in recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports are split among predic-
tions of enhanced, reduced, or unchanged ENSO variability by the end of the 21st century (Collins et al.,
2010; Meehl et al., 2007), and the IPCC reports low conﬁdence in projections of future ENSO variability
(Christensen et al., 2013). Reconstructions of paleo‐ENSO may help resolve these discrepancies through
improving our knowledge of its responses to past radiative and climatic forcings.
The interannual behavior of ENSO limits the archives from which ENSO can be reconstructed to those that
are able to preserve short‐term (monthly to annual) variability. Annually banded corals provide high‐
resolution records of past ENSO (e.g., Cobb et al., 2013; Hughen et al., 1999; Tudhope et al., 2001).
However, long continuous records of past ENSO are difﬁcult to reconstruct from individual corals.
Annually varved lake sediments from the tropical Andes have also been used to reconstruct past ENSO

through evaluation of changes in precipitation and/or lake sedimentation (e.g., Moy et al., 2002; Rodbell
et al., 1999). However, the nonlinear response of rainfall to sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the equatorial
Paciﬁc (Emile‐Geay & Tingley, 2016), speciﬁcally the difference in rainfall between Eastern Paciﬁc and
coastal El Niño events (extreme precipitation) and Central Paciﬁc El Niño and La Niña events (less intense
precipitation) (Kiefer & Karamperidou, 2019), makes it difﬁcult to directly attribute changes in lake deposi-
tion to ENSO.
Individual foraminifera analysis (IFA), an emerging tool for reconstructing past ENSO (e.g., Ford et al., 2015;
Khider et al., 2011; Koutavas et al., 2006; Koutavas & Joanides, 2012; Leduc et al., 2009; Rustic et al., 2015;
Scroxton et al., 2011; White et al., 2018), allows the construction of long, continuous down‐core records of
monthly scale SST variability. While its utility has been tested in down‐core applications, little focus has
been placed on calibrating this method to modern conditions (Groeneveld et al., 2019). Here we ground truth
a method for reconstructing temperature variability (seasonal plus interannual) using populations of
individual Mg/Ca measurements in two species of planktic foraminifera, Globigerinoides ruber and
Neogloboquadrina dutertrei. We compare these populations to temperature distributions simulated from
the Simple Ocean Data Analysis (SODA) monthly temperatures. We compare variances and employ
probability density functions (pdfs) and quantile‐quantile (Q‐Q) analysis to evaluate whether individual
measurements of Mg/Ca in G. ruber and N. dutertrei accurately capture temperature variability at sites across
the equatorial Paciﬁc.
2. Individual Foraminifera Analysis
The theoretical framework for IFA is based on the observation that planktic foraminifera live on the order of
2–4 weeks (Spero, 1998), which is a short enough life span to capture monthly changes in ocean tempera-
tures associated with ENSO. While the chemical analysis of a single sample containing multiple specimens
of planktic foraminifera results in the averaging of individual calciﬁcation temperatures, the analysis of mul-
tiple samples each containing a single planktic foraminifer preserves population statistics that can be used to
interpret changes in temperature variability.
Temperatures inferred from IFA, such as those calculated from δ18O (Khider et al., 2011; Koutavas et al.,
2006; Koutavas & Joanides, 2012; Leduc et al., 2009; Rustic et al., 2015; Scroxton et al., 2011) or Mg/Ca ratios
(Ford et al., 2015; White et al., 2018), allow paleoceanographers to probe past changes in mean state, season-
ality, and interannual (ENSO) variability. A change in the background mean state with no change in
variance can be observed as a positive or negative shift in a temperature population (Figure 1a). In contrast,
a change in seasonality or ENSO variability will theoretically affect the height and tails of a temperature dis-
tribution: An increase in variability will result in the shortening and broadening of a temperature distribu-
tion (Figure 1b), while a decrease in variability will result in a heightening and narrowing of a temperature
distribution (Figure 1c). For ENSO, these changes assume a symmetric response of El Niño (warm) and La
Niña (cold) events. In the eastern equatorial Paciﬁc (EEP) and central equatorial Paciﬁc (CEP), changes in
ENSO variability may be more easily captured by the warm tails of IFA temperature populations because
SST anomalies are greater during El Niño events than during La Niña events (An & Jin, 2001).
Furthermore, site selection is important for disentangling total and ENSO variability because changes in sea-
sonality can manifest as changes in temperature distribution shape similar to those predicted for ENSO
(Thirumalai et al., 2013). For example, sites where ENSO has a larger impact than seasonality on modern
temperature distributions have been targeted for diagnosing past changes in ENSO (Ford et al., 2015;
White et al., 2018).
3. Materials and Methods
3.1. Sample Selection and Chemical Analysis
Samples were obtained from nine sediment core tops across the equatorial Paciﬁc, including one site in the
western equatorial Paciﬁc (WEP), two sites near the Line Islands in the CEP, and six sites in the EEP
(Figure 2 and Table 1). In order to evaluate differences in oceanographic regimes across the equatorial
Paciﬁc and within the EEP, core tops were selected to cover a range of modern total and interannual tem-
perature variability, at both the sea surface and at depth (Figure 2). Total temperature variability was com-
puted from SODA v.2.2.4 as the root mean square anomaly of monthly temperatures, and interannual

temperature variability was computed as the root mean square anomaly of monthly temperature
anomalies (Figure 2).
Previous paleo‐ENSO work suggests a shift in ENSO mean‐state and variance between the mid‐Holocene
and late Holocene (Koutavas et al., 2006), so sampling was limited to sites with calibrated radiocarbon ages
of approximately 4,500 years or younger (Table 1). Calibrated radiocarbon ages were previously reported for
MGL1208‐26MC (Costa et al., 2016), MGL1208‐14MC (Costa et al., 2016; White et al., 2018), KNR195‐5
MC‐42A (Rustic et al., 2015), and RC13‐140 and RC23‐22 (Doss & Marchitto, 2013) (supporting information
Table S1). We calibrated the raw radiocarbon dates previously presented in Berger and Killingley (1982) for
Sites ERDC 92Bx and PLDS 72Bx using the MARINE13 calibration curve (Reimer et al., 2013) (Table S1).
Two new radiocarbon ages were generated for KNR195‐5 11‐MCA and OC73‐1‐2 using specimens of N.

dutertrei. Samples were graphitized at the University of Colorado and analyzed on an accelerator mass spec-
trometer at the University of California, Irvine, and converted to calendar ages using the MARINE13 calibra-
tion curve (Reimer et al., 2013) (Table S1).
Modern ENSO variability is exhibited in ocean temperatures both at the sea surface and at depth within the
thermocline. In the thermocline, interannual variability accounts for most of the total variability because
seasonality is largely restricted to the near surface, making the thermocline an appealing target for paleo‐
ENSO reconstruction (Figure 2). Therefore, two species of planktic foraminifera, surface dwelling G. ruber
(250–355 μm) and thermocline dwelling N. dutertrei (355–425 μm), were selected for analyses.
Morphotypes of both species were recorded prior to chemical cleaning but are not separated in our analyses
to avoid potential bias toward a speciﬁc depth habitat or temperature range. At each site, approximately 70
individuals or greater of each species were picked and analyzed for Mg/Ca ratios (Table 1). The only site with
less than ~70 specimens is Site RC23‐22 which contains 57 individuals for G. ruber. Due to poor preservation,
only a few specimens of G. ruber survived chemical cleaning at Site MGL1208‐26MC in the CEP and at Sites
PLDS 72Bx and KNR195‐5 MC‐11A in the EEP, so G. ruber Mg/Ca data are not presented for those cores.
Individuals were oxidatively cleaned, dissolved, and analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectro-
metry following procedures outlined in Rongstad et al. (2017), with analytical precision of ±0.6% on Mg/Ca
(1σ). Al/Ca, Fe/Ca, and Mn/Ca were also measured to monitor for sedimentary contamination. Mg/Ca data
from ERDC92Bx were presented previously by Rongstad et al. (2017).
3.2. Statistical Analysis of Inferred Temperatures
Planktic foraminiferal Mg/Ca is a well‐established tool for reconstructing past ocean temperatures
(e.g., Nürnberg et al., 1996; Lea et al., 1999; Elderﬁeld & Ganssen, 2000; Anand et al., 2003). We model
the foraminiferal Mg/Ca data in an inverse sense, converting Mg/Ca to calciﬁcation temperatures, because
that is the task facing paleoceanographers; and because Mg/Ca‐inferred temperature variability is insensi-
tive to partial dissolution, in contrast to Mg/Ca variability (Rongstad et al., 2017). Inferred temperatures
were calculated from Mg/Ca ratios using the Anand et al. (2003) sediment trap temperature calibrations,
speciﬁcally their geometric mean method for G. ruber white (250–350 μm) giving a 10% increase in Mg/Ca
per °C, and their assumed exponential constant method for N. dutertrei (350–500 μm) giving 9% per °C.
Implications of using a lower temperature sensitivity for G. ruber (e.g., Gray et al., 2018) are discussed in
section 4.3. In at least some species of planktic foraminifera, Mg/Ca is subject to small ancillary inﬂuences
from salinity (3% to 5% per salinity unit) (Allen et al., 2016; Gray et al., 2018; Gray & Evans, 2019; Hönisch
et al., 2013; Lea et al., 1999) and pH (−5% to −9% per 0.1 pH unit) (Gray et al., 2018; Gray & Evans, 2019) that
are not modeled here but are discussed in section 4.3.
While partial dissolution results in a reduction of planktic foraminiferal Mg/Ca ratios (Brown & Elderﬁeld,
1996; Dekens et al., 2002; Regenberg et al., 2014; Rosenthal & Lohmann, 2002), G. ruber and N. dutertrei lose
Mg to partial dissolution as a percentage of the Mg initially present, resulting in no signiﬁcant change in cal-
culated temperature variance or temperature distribution shape (Rongstad et al., 2017). Therefore, a

dissolution correction scheme is unnecessary to evaluate differences or changes in temperature distributions
derived from individual measurements of Mg/Ca in these taxa. Instead, we subtract the population's mean
temperature from each of the individual temperatures, resulting in a modiﬁed population centered around
zero that can be compared to similarly treated instrumental data. Note that population mean temperatures
were cooler than the regional‐habitat SODA simulations by an average of 2.5 °C (1.9 °C excluding RC13‐140)
for G. ruber and 5.6 °C for N. dutertrei, reﬂecting a cold bias probably due to partial dissolution.
Modern ocean temperatures for each site and depth were estimated using the monthly reanalysis
(Years 1981–2008) from SODA v.2.2.4. In order to more directly compare the SODA temperatures to the tem-
peratures derived from Mg/Ca in planktic foraminifera, theoretical distributions of Mg/Ca‐based tempera-
tures for G. ruber and N. dutertrei were simulated from SODA using a Monte Carlo approach. First,
spatially uniform depth habitats were assumed for both G. ruber and N. dutertrei for all sites across the equa-
torial Paciﬁc (Figure 3, top). The depth distribution for G. ruber was simulated by constructing a normal dis-
tribution of SODA depths with a mean of 5 m and a standard deviation of 1 depth step in SODA (~10–12 m in
the upper 50 m of the water column). This normal distribution was then truncated at the surface so that no
depths could be shallower than the shallowest observation in SODA (5 m). The resulting G. ruber depth
distribution is skewed toward deeper depths with a mean depth of 9 m (Figure 3, top). N. dutertrei's depth
distribution was simulated by constructing a normal distribution of SODA depths with a mean of 47 m
and a standard deviation of 1 depth step in SODA (~12–15 m).
The simulated uniform depth distributions of G. ruber and N. dutertrei described above are consistent with
observations of both species' depth habitats. G. ruber typically lives in the upper 50 m of the water column
(Fairbanks et al., 1982; Faul et al., 2000; Ravelo & Fairbanks, 1992), and N. dutertrei lives in the thermocline
(Fairbanks & Wiebe, 1980; Field, 2004; Ravelo & Fairbanks, 1992; Sautter & Thunell, 1991) where it likely
feeds on marine snow (Fehrenbacher et al., 2018). In the EEP, where the majority of our core‐tops are
located, 47 m places N. dutertrei in the mid‐to‐deep thermocline (Figure 3).
While spatially uniform depth distributions for G. ruber and N. dutertrei produced good results in the EEP,
they underestimate the foraminiferal variance in the CEP and WEP (see section 4.1). Therefore, CEP and
WEP depth distributions were altered to account for regional oceanographic differences and observed pat-
terns in G. ruber and N. dutertrei depth habitats across the equatorial Paciﬁc (see section 4.2). In the CEP,
the mixed layer and thermocline are much deeper than in the EEP, so G. ruber and N. dutertrei depth distri-
butions were simulated to be deeper and broader. While the depth distributions for N. dutertrei remained
normal in shape, depth distributions for G. ruber were simulated to be more skewed in shape. G. ruber
(mean = 57 m) was simulated to be uniform in concentration from the surface to the top of the thermocline
(~83 m depth) and decreasing in concentration below that depth (Figure 3, bottom). N. dutertrei was simu-
lated to have normally distributed concentrations centered about a mean of 130 m ± 16–22 m (1 depth step in
SODA) (Figure 3, bottom). In the WEP, the mixed layer and thermocline are deeper still, so G. ruber was dee-
pened to a mean of 66 m with a concentration that is uniform until decreasing below ~100 m depth and N.
dutertrei was deepened to a mean of 150 m ± 18–25 m (1 depth step in SODA) (Figure 3, bottom).
For each species and site, theoretical Mg/Ca temperature distributions were built by randomly sampling 70
depths from the species' depth distribution and then randomly sampling a monthly temperature (1981–2008)
for each of the 70 depths. Foraminifera were assumed to have an equal probability of living during any
month of the year because, with the exception of site OC73‐1‐2, the seasonal cycle weakly affects the
observed total temperature variability in the equatorial Paciﬁc (Figure 2). Each simulated temperature
was then randomly perturbed by 0 ± 1.5 °C (1σ) to approximate the inherent uncertainty in the Mg/Ca ther-
mometer (Sadekov et al., 2008). This process was repeated 10,000 times to capture stochastic variability
among the theoretical distributions.
Variance was computed for the planktic foraminifera Mg/Ca temperature distributions and for each of the
simulated Mg/Ca temperature distributions. To contrast individual sites against the basin‐wide equatorial
Paciﬁc average, temperatures were combined over the grid 10°S to 10°N and 140°E to 90°W using the uni-
form depth distributions of G. ruber (mean depth = 9 m) and N. dutertrei (mean depth = 47 in the spreads
and shapes of the temperature distributions were evaluated using kernel pdfs and Q‐Q analysis. Kernel pdfs
are a nonparametric tool used to approximate the shape of a distribution without assuming normality.
Kernels were constructed for the foraminifera Mg/Ca temperature distributions and for each of the 10,000

simulated SODA Mg/Ca temperature distributions at each site using the
“ﬁtdist” function in MATLAB (v.R2018b) and a bandwidth of 1. In order
to test the ﬁt of the foraminifera temperature kernels to the SODA tem-
perature kernels, we computed the mean kernel and 95% conﬁdence
bounds using the temperature frequencies in each simulated kernel. A
good ﬁt between the temperature data sets is indicated when the forami-
nifera Mg/Ca temperature kernel falls within the 95% conﬁdence bounds
of the 10,000 simulated Mg/Ca temperature kernels.
Q‐Q analysis is a powerful tool that highlights differences between distri-
bution shapes by graphically comparing the quantiles of two populations
(Wilk & Wilk & Gnanadesikan, 1968; Ford et al., 2015). Q‐Q plots are used
in this study in three ways: (1) to compare the shapes of the measured
Mg/Ca temperature distributions to the simulated SODA Mg/Ca tempera-
ture distributions at each site, (2) to compare both the measured and
simulated Mg/Ca temperature distributions at each site to basin‐wide
temperatures, to highlight site‐speciﬁc or regional characteristics, and
(3) to test the ability of Mg/Ca IFA to reconstruct hydrographic differences
between sites. In order to test how well the planktic foraminifera Mg/Ca
temperature distributions matched the simulated SODA Mg/Ca tempera-
ture distributions, a 95% conﬁdence interval was calculated from the
quantiles computed for each of the 10,000 simulated Mg/Ca temperature
distributions. To estimate uncertainty when comparing measured (not
simulated) Mg/Ca temperature distributions between two sites, a kernel
pdf was ﬁt to each distribution, and then 70 temperatures were resampled
from each kernel 10,000 times. Quantiles were then computed for each of
the 10,000 resamples, and conﬁdence bounds (90% and 80%) were com-
puted for each site by plotting the high bound quantiles of one location
versus the low bound quantiles of the other location and vice versa.
4. Results and Discussion
Individual samples of G. ruber and N. dutertrei (n = 1,186) were picked and analyzed for Mg/Ca ratios. Of
those samples, 42 (3.5%) were considered lost during cleaning (ﬁnal mass < 0.1 μg CaCO3), 34 (2.9%) were
rejected due to having Al/Ca or Fe/Ca ≥1 mmol mol−1 or Mn/Ca ≥1.5 mmol mol−1, 17 (1.4%) were rejected
due to having Mg/Ca > 10 mmol mol−1, and 9 (0.8%) were rejected for having inferred temperatures greater
than 3 standard deviations above the means of their populations. The culled data set is therefore composed of
1,084 individuals.
Inspection of instrumental SSTs (Figure 2) leads us to expect that G. ruber Mg/Ca temperature distributions
will exhibit a large range of intersite variances within the EEP, and a general increase in variance from the
WEP, through the CEP, to the EEP average. Broadly speaking, this pattern is borne out in the G. ruber Mg/Ca
observations: Variance in the WEP is less than both the variance in the CEP and the mean of the variances in
the EEP (Figure 4a). The largest G. ruber variance is found in the EEP (Site RC13‐140, variance = 8.4 °C2),
and with the exception of the easternmost site (RC23‐22), the smallest variance is found in the WEP
(Site ERDC 92Bx, variance = 2.6 °C2).
Instrumental temperatures at 47 m (Figure 2) point toward a similar expectation for the zonal pattern of var-
iance among N. dutertrei Mg/Ca temperature distributions. While N. dutertrei from the WEP indeed shows
smaller Mg/Ca temperature variance than in the CEP, the EEP unexpectedly shows, on average, the smallest
variance of all (Figure 4b). As discussed below, this observation can be explained by regional differences in
depth habitats.
4.1. SODA Simulations With Uniform Depth Distributions
When assuming spatially uniform and shallow (mean = 9 m) depth habitats, the G. ruber Mg/Ca tempera-
ture distributions most closely match the simulations in the EEP (at three of four sites) (Figures 5a, 6, and 7).

Site RC23‐22 in the EEP produces the best match: The quantiles of the measured temperature distribution
fall mostly within the 95% conﬁdence interval bounds of the simulated temperature distributions, and
both measured and simulated temperature distributions exhibit normally distributed temperatures that
are slightly smaller in spread than that of the basin‐wide temperatures (Figure 7). At EEP Site OC73‐1‐2,
there is a small divergence between the two data sets where the G. ruber temperature distribution does
not capture the bimodal character of the SODA temperature simulations (Figure 6). At EEP Site KNR195‐
5 42‐MCA, the G. ruber temperature distribution displays a slightly smaller warm tail than most of the
SODA temperature simulations (Figure 6). However, despite these small divergences, the Q‐Q plots for
OC73‐1‐2 and KNR195‐5‐MC42A indicate that the quantiles of the G. ruber temperature distributions still
fall
mainly
within

distributions (Figure 7).
Larger divergences between G. ruber Mg/Ca temperatures and simulated temperatures occur in the WEP,
CEP, and at Site RC13‐140 in the EEP. At all three locations, the foraminifera Mg/Ca temperature distribu-
tions consistently produce a greater spread than the distributions simulated from SODA (Figures 5a, 6, and
7). Q‐Q plots of G. ruber temperature distributions versus basin‐wide temperatures fall almost entirely out-
side of the 95% conﬁdence intervals of the 10,000 simulated SODA distributions (Figure 7), indicating poor
matches for these three sites. At RC13‐140, the G. ruber data exhibit a much longer warm tail than any of the
SODA simulations (Figure 7).
The best matches between the shapes of the N. dutertrei temperature distributions and the uniform habitat
(mean = 47 m) SODA temperature distributions, like G. ruber, occur in the EEP. There, the measured and
simulated temperature distributions exhibit similar spreads (Figures 5c and 6), with the Q‐Q plots at Sites
RC23‐22 and KNR195‐5 11‐MCA showing the strongest concordance between the measured and simulated
temperatures (Figure 7). The N. dutertrei and simulated SODA temperature distributions at both sites, espe-
cially Site RC23‐22, capture a distinct warm tail that is not found in the basin‐wide temperatures (Figure 7).
With the exception of RC13‐140, the Q‐Q plots of the remaining EEP sites also show close matches between
the N. dutertrei and SODA temperature distributions. The N. dutertrei temperature distributions at EEP Sites

KNR195‐5 MC‐42A and PLDS 72Bx exhibit slightly smaller warm tails than predicted by the SODA simula-
tions, and the N. dutertrei at OC73‐1‐2 exhibits a slightly narrower range of temperatures than the SODA
temperature distributions (Figure 6). However, the Q‐Q plots indicate an overall good ﬁt between the two
groups of data at each site (Figure 7).
Similar to the G. ruber data, the largest divergences between the N. dutertrei Mg/Ca temperature distribu-
tions and the simulated uniform‐depth temperature distributions occur in the WEP, CEP, and at Site
RC13‐140 in the EEP. In the WEP and CEP, the N. dutertrei temperature distributions consistently produce
temperature ranges that are greater than those simulated from SODA (Figures 5c and 6). The Q‐Q plots of N.
dutertrei temperature distributions versus basin‐wide temperatures fall well outside of the 95% conﬁdence
interval bounds of the 10,000 SODA simulations, indicating large discordances between the two temperature
groups (Figure 7). At Site RC13‐140 in the EEP, the mismatch between the measured and simulated N.
dutertrei Mg/Ca temperatures is not nearly as large, but the Q‐Q plot does fall largely outside of the 95% con-
ﬁdence interval of the 10,000 simulations near the warm end of the distribution (Figure 7). In contrast to the
G. ruber Mg/Ca at this site, N. dutertrei records less variance than the simulations, and the mismatch with
SODA is less severe.
4.2. SODA Simulations With Regional Depth Distributions
Statistical tests indicate a high discordance between the foraminifera Mg/Ca temperature distributions and
the uniform‐depth SODA simulated Mg/Ca temperature distributions in the WEP and CEP (Figures 5–7).
The observed discrepancies between measured and simulated Mg/Ca temperatures using shallow ﬁxed
depth habitats at our WEP site are mirrored by Groeneveld et al. (2019). In their western Paciﬁc warm pool
core top, the authors found that the standard deviations of their measured Mg/Ca temperatures were higher
than predicted for Trilobatus sacculifer (assumed habitat = 35 m) and N. dutertrei (100 m), and they found
little improvement in the discrepancy when expanding each species' depth habitat to a range (T. sacculifer
= 20–70 m and N. dutertrei = 80–120 m) (Groeneveld et al., 2019). As the oceanographic regimes of the
WEP, CEP, and EEP are different, these results are not surprising. The equatorial Paciﬁc exhibits a zonally
tilted thermocline, which is deep in the WEP and shallow in the EEP. This results in a much deeper mixed
layer in the WEP, which combined with lower productivity allows warm water and light (important for
photosymbionts) to penetrate much deeper than in the east. These differences have important implications
for the depth habitats of planktic foraminifera.
G. ruber inhabits the mixed layer and is typically thought to live in the upper 50 m of the water column
(Fairbanks et al., 1982; Faul et al., 2000; Ravelo & Fairbanks, 1992), but its peak calciﬁcation depth has been
found to vary by region. In the EEP, its habitat depth is close to the sea surface due to a shallow thermocline
and mixed layer. However, in the WEP, its peak calciﬁcation depth appears to be much deeper (50–100 m)
based on geochemical comparisons between living planktic foraminifera and modern ocean water chemistry
(Rippert et al., 2016). In the EEP, N. dutertrei's average depth habitat is estimated to fall between 65 and 75 m
as calculated by comparing core‐top temperatures derived from δ18Ocalcite to modern temperatures recorded
in GLODAP v1.1 (Mekik, 2018). In the WEP, comparisons of foraminiferal geochemsitry to modern water
chemistry suggest N. dutertrei has a mean calciﬁcation depth of 140 m (Rippert et al., 2016), and analysis
of intrashell Mg/Ca variability suggests that the bulk of N. dutertrei's test is built at the depth of the modern
thermocline (~100–250 m) (Eggins et al., 2003). In the tropical Atlantic, δ18Ocalcite likewise indicates that N.
dutertrei follows the thermocline, shoaling from ~100–150 m in the west to ~50–100 m in the east (Ravelo &
Andreasen, 1999; Steph et al., 2009).
Accounting for deeper habitats for both G. ruber and N. dutertrei in the CEP and WEP would broaden the
distributions of the SODA simulations there, potentially bringing them into closer agreement with the
Mg/Ca observations. Regional depth corrections for the CEP and WEP were chosen by incorporating docu-
mented regional differences in habitat depth as described above. The G. ruber depth distributions were dee-
pened to a mean of 57 m in the CEP and 66 m in the WEP, while the N. dutertrei depth distributions were
deepened to a mean of 130 m in the CEP and 150 m in the WEP (see section 3.2 and Figure 3).
While they did not employ deeper habitats for their western Paciﬁc warm pool site, Groeneveld et al. (2019)
concluded that regional differences in depth habitat must be considered when interpreting temperature
variability derived from individual measurements of Mg/Ca individual planktic foraminifera, and our

results conﬁrm their observation. Regional depth corrections dramatically improve concordance of both
spread (Figures 5b, 5d, and 6) and shape (Figure 7) of the foraminifera and simulated Mg/Ca temperature
distributions. The CEP and WEP planktic foraminifera temperature quantiles fall within the 95%
conﬁdence interval bounds of the 10,000 SODA temperature distribution simulations much more
frequently than the simulations that employ a uniform‐depth distribution (Figure 7). At Site ERDC92Bx
in the WEP, the G. ruber and SODA simulated Mg/Ca temperature distributions both capture a distinct
cold tail, though the N. dutertrei temperature distribution does not closely resemble the skewed shape of
the simulated Mg/Ca temperature distribution (Figures 6 and 7). In the CEP, the N. dutertrei temperature
distribution at Site MGL1208‐26MC is still more abnormally shaped than the simulated SODA
temperature distributions (Figure 6); however, Q‐Q analysis shows a decent match between the
foraminifera and simulated temperature distributions, with some quantiles falling outside the conﬁdence
bounds near the center of the temperature distributions (Figure 7). At Site MGL1208‐14MC in the CEP,
the quantiles for measured G. ruber temperatures fall much closer the 95% conﬁdence bounds than the
simulations using a uniform depth distribution but do also exhibit a longer warm tail than simulated
(Figures 6 and 7). The quantiles for the measured N. dutertrei temperatures at this site fall mainly with
the 95% conﬁdence interval bounds of the 10,000 SODA simulations (Figures 6 and 7).
While our simulations assume foraminifera have an equal probability of living throughout the year, sedi-
ment trap studies in Panama Basin suggest that some species of planktic foraminifera exhibit their largest
ﬂuxes during the summer months or upwelling season (e.g., Bé et al., 1985; Thunell et al., 1983; Thunell

& Reynolds, 1984). However, total temperature variability at most of our sites is dominated by interannual
variability, with little seasonality (Figure 2), so repeating our simulations using particular seasons has
negligible impact. Only one of our sites is dominated by the seasonal cycle (surface temperatures at OC73‐
1‐2), but its location (7°S) makes it difﬁcult to directly compare to the Panama Basin studies. We tested mul-
tiple seasonal ﬂux scenarios in our SODA simulations of Mg/Ca temperature at OC73‐1‐2, but none of the
scenarios are capable of improving the discrepancy between G. ruber and simulated Mg/Ca temperatures
at both the warmest and coldest quantiles of the distributions.
The remaining discrepancies between the planktic foraminifera Mg/Ca temperature distributions and the
simulated temperature distributions could be in part due to sampling errors. For example, the irregular
shape of the N. dutertrei population at MGL1208‐26MC (Figure 6) could possibly be improved with more
Mg/Ca analyses. Other discrepancies, such as at Site RC13‐140 where the G. ruber simulation is too narrow
or OC73‐1‐2 where it is too broad (Figure 6), might be due to slight differences in depth habitat not
accounted for in our selected depth distributions. Furthermore, it is possible that SODA temperatures do
not capture the full range of variability experienced during the past few hundred to few thousand years that
the foraminifera represent, and such a bias could vary by site.

4.3. Temperature Sensitivity, Salinity, and pH
While partial dissolution can be ruled out as a possible statistic modiﬁer (Rongstad et al., 2017), the shapes of
temperature distributions do rely partly on the choice of Mg/Ca temperature calibration. There is longstand-
ing support for temperature sensitivities of ~8–10% Mg/Ca per °C, across multiple species of planktic fora-
minifera (e.g., Anand et al., 2003; Elderﬁeld & Ganssen, 2000; Lea et al., 1999; Nürnberg et al., 1996).
However, recent multivariate analyses of sediment trap data (Gray et al., 2018) and culture experiments
(Gray & Evans, 2019) suggest that the Mg/Ca temperature sensitivity of G. ruber may actually be closer to
6%, with salinity and pH explaining signiﬁcant portions of the Mg/Ca signal. A lower temperature sensitivity
for G. ruber would broaden our inferred temperature distributions derived from Mg/Ca ratios, requiring
broader depth distributions in the SODA simulations. However, since our approach does not include the
effects of salinity and pH, which likely contribute to the observed Mg/Ca variance, that inferred temperature
spread would be an overestimate. An explicit forward model of our Mg/Ca data using oceanographic obser-
vations of temperature, salinity, and pH is left to future work, but we make some preliminary
observations below.
Total variability in salinity is relatively low for our equatorial Paciﬁc core‐top locations (<0.6 psu at the sur-
face and <0.4 psu at 47 m depth) and is similar between sites (Giese & Ray, 2011), so it is unlikely that sali-
nity is contributing signiﬁcantly to either the measured Mg/Ca temperature variability or the differences in
variability between our core‐top locations. Furthermore, the similarity in salinity (both in annual and total
variability) between Sites RC13‐140 and RC23‐22 cannot explain why the measured Mg/Ca temperatures at
RC13‐140 diverge from the simulated Mg/Ca temperatures while the measured Mg/Ca temperatures at
RC23‐22 closely match the simulated Mg/Ca temperatures.
The apparent temperature sensitivity of G. ruber Mg/Ca has recently been parsed into a “direct” thermal
effect of ~6% per °C plus a pH effect that contributes another ~3% per °C, via the temperature sensitivity
of the dissociation constant of water (i.e., higher temperature lowers pH, thereby boosting Mg/Ca)
(Gray et al., 2018; Gray & Evans, 2019). To the extent that equatorial Paciﬁc pH variability is controlled
by the dissociation constant of water, the Anand et al. (2003) temperature sensitivity should adequately
account for the combined inﬂuences of temperature and pH. However, cold and low‐pH (carbon‐rich)
waters may be brought to the sea surface by upwelling, especially in the EEP (Key et al., 2015). Under such
conditions, the direct thermal and pH inﬂuences on Mg/Ca may work in partial opposition, theoretically
resulting in lower Mg/Ca variance. Total variability in sea surface pH ranges from ~0.01 to 0.03 pH units
for our core‐top locations, with maximum variance in the cold tongue east of Galapagos (Iida et al., 2015;
Takatani et al., 2014). In terms of Mg/Ca, this pH variability should have a much smaller impact than tem-
perature, but it also implies that pH and temperature are not strongly additive in the equatorial Paciﬁc.
Hence, a lower temperature sensitivity (Gray et al., 2018; Gray & Evans, 2019) may be appropriate.
4.4. EEP Site Comparisons
Comparisons of the foraminifera and simulated SODA Mg/Ca temperature distributions across the equator-
ial Paciﬁc indicate that individual measurements of Mg/Ca in G. ruber and N. dutertrei are able to capture
realistic site‐speciﬁc temperature variability. However, to validate the utility of Mg/Ca IFA as a paleoceano-
graphic proxy, it is also important to test whether it is able to capture differences in variability between sites.
To do this, we used pairwise Q‐Q analysis to compare observed Mg/Ca temperature distributions amongst all
sites within the EEP, spanning a range of annual mean temperature, total temperature variability, and inter-
annual temperature variability (Figure 2).
The measured Mg/Ca temperature distribution from Site RC13‐140 exhibits a larger warm tail than any of
the other G. ruber sites in the EEP at the 90% conﬁdence level (very likely, by IPCC convention)
(Figure 8). However, the depth distribution for G. ruber at Site RC13‐140 does not produce a good match with
SODA simulations of temperature and therefore may be capturing variability in Mg/Ca unrelated to tem-
perature and/or temperature variability not captured in the SODA data set. The remaining EEP sites are
more similar to each other in shape at the 90% conﬁdence level (Figure 8). The G. ruber temperature distri-
bution at Site RC23‐22 exhibits a smaller range of temperatures than Sites KNR195‐5 MC‐42A and OC73‐1‐2
(Figure 8), which is consistent with SODA computations of total variability (Figure 2), but not
statistically signiﬁcant.

For N. dutertrei, Site RC23‐22 exhibits a warm tail that is larger than at Sites PLDS 72Bx, KNR195‐5 MC‐42A,
and OC73‐1‐2 at the 90% conﬁdence level (Figure 9). Site KNR195‐5 MC‐11A N. dutertrei exhibits a larger
warm tail than at Sites KNR195‐5 MC‐42A and OC73‐1‐2 at the 80% (likely) conﬁdence level (Figure S3).
These observations are corroborated by the SODA computations at 47 m: Both RC23‐22 and KNR195
MC‐11A are situated well within the region of relatively high interannual variability (the highest targeted
in this study) (Figure 2), where El Niño events give the temperature distribution a distinct warm
tail (Figure 6).
The easternmost EEP site (RC23‐22) and the southernmost EEP site (OC73‐1‐2) provide valuable insight into
the capability of Mg/Ca IFA to distinguish between sites with observable differences in hydrographic condi-
tions. At the sea surface, Site OC73‐1‐2 experiences higher seasonality and total variability compared to Site
RC23‐22 as computed from SODA (Figure 2). The Q‐Q plot comparing the G. ruber Mg/Ca temperature dis-
tributions indicates that the total temperature range of OC73‐1‐2 is the larger of the two sites (Figure 8) and
corroborates the SODA computations. At 47 m depth, Site RC23‐22 sits within a region of relatively high
total and interannual variability, while Site OC73‐1‐2 sites on the boundary with a region of lower variability
(Figure 2). This is corroborated by the Q‐Q plot comparing the N. dutertrei Mg/Ca temperature distributions,
which shows an elongated warm tail (attributable to ENSO variability) at Site RC23‐22. Thus, the foramini-
fera correctly reconstruct which site is more variable at the surface and which site is more variable at depth.
4.5. Implications for Paleo‐ENSO Reconstruction
Paleoceanographers often assume that planktic foraminiferal habitat depths remain constant through
time. In this study, we inferred that G. ruber and N. dutertrei depths vary regionally, which raises the
probability that they vary temporally. For reconstructing ENSO variability, this may actually be an
advantage. As the mean depth of the thermocline changes with time, the most variable portion of the
temperature proﬁle could be pushed into or out of the habitat of foraminifera that hypothetically live
within a constant depth range, producing a change in Mg/Ca variance that could be mistaken for a
change in ENSO (Ford et al., 2015, 2018). In contrast, we suggest that N. dutertrei tracks the average
depth of the thermocline, so that any past change in its Mg/Ca variance would be attributable to a
change in temperature variance within the thermocline and hence most likely to a change in ENSO.
Since ENSO itself involves an interannual change in the depth of the thermocline, this framework
assumes that N. dutertrei does not inhabit a very narrow and speciﬁc portion of the thermocline but
rather a range of depths that encompass its average position.
Selecting sites that accurately record changes in temperature variability is critical for paleo‐ENSO recon-
structions. Sites targeted for down‐core work should exhibit a robust calibration based on coherence of
core‐top foraminifera Mg/Ca temperatures and modern ocean temperatures. Our results indicate there is
an overall good match between the temperature data sets after accounting for differences in hydrographic
regimes between regions, with occasional exceptions like RC13‐140 G. ruber (Figures 6 and 7).
Furthermore, sites selected for down‐core work should exhibit modern interannual temperature variability
and a high ratio of interannual to total temperature variability, so that past changes in seasonality are less
likely to be mistaken for ENSO (Thirumalai et al., 2013). The latter qualiﬁcation is likely more critical for
G. ruber (surface) reconstructions where interannual temperature variability is smaller, and the seasonal
cycle is larger, than what is observed at depth. Temperature maps derived from SODA highlight distinct dif-
ferences between locations and depths across the equatorial Paciﬁc. For example, the highest observed inter-
annual variability occurs at depth (~47–70 m) (Figures 2 and S1), but regions of high interannual to total
temperature variability do occur at the surface (Figure 2).
Groeneveld et al. (2019) suggest that ecology, including seasonal ﬂuxes of foraminifera, may dramatically
impact the spread of Mg/Ca and δ18O temperatures. However, our analysis of simulated and measured
Mg/Ca temperatures suggests that seasonal ﬂuxes of foraminifera only results in a bias in locations domi-
nated by seasonal temperature variability (Site OC73‐1‐2). Site selection for down‐core work should there-
fore carefully consider simulations of temperature and/or proxy variability (e.g., Zhu et al., 2017) that
highlight changes in seasonality.
Among the sites we analyzed, Site RC23‐22 provides one of the best ﬁts between the foraminifera and simu-
lated SODA Mg/Ca temperature distributions (Figures 6 and 7) and exhibits both the largest ratio of

interannual to total variability at the surface and the largest observed interannual temperature variability at
47 m depth (Figure 2). The match between the temperature data sets for G. ruber is the best among all equa-
torial Paciﬁc sites (Figure 7) and the measured temperature distribution exhibits the smallest warm tail in
the EEP (Figure 8). The N. dutertrei temperature distribution at Site RC23‐22 is an excellent match for the
simulated SODA Mg/Ca temperature distribution and exhibits the largest warm tail of all the N. dutertrei
temperature distributions in the EEP (Figure 8) and across the equatorial Paciﬁc (Figure 7). Importantly,
the elongated warm tail of the N. dutertrei Mg/Ca temperature distribution indicates that this may be an
excellent site for capturing changes in variability in the warm tail (El Niño) in the past. While Site
KNR195‐5 MC‐11A does not have G. ruber Mg/Ca temperatures to compare to simulations, it also exhibits
a good match between the N. dutertrei temperature distribution and corresponding SODA simulations and
is located within a region of relatively high interannual variability. Similar to Site RC23‐22, the characteristic
warm tail indicates that this site exhibits large warm temperature variability likely diagnostic of ENSO (El
Niño) variance in the past.
5. Conclusions
We compared temperature distributions derived from individual measurements of Mg/Ca in G. ruber and N.
dutertrei from nine core tops across the equatorial Paciﬁc to temperature distributions simulated for the
same locations using SODA. Our data show that populations of individual Mg/Ca measurements capture
site‐speciﬁc temperature distribution shapes and variance when accounting for regional differences in depth
habitats across the equatorial Paciﬁc. Populations of individual Mg/Ca measurements are able to recover dif-
ferences in temperature variability between sites within the EEP, with some sites displaying distinct warm
tails characteristic of El Niño events. This work demonstrates that Mg/Ca IFA is a valid tool for probing past
ENSO variability, especially when targeting sites with substantial modern interannual temperature variabil-
ity and a high ratio of interannual to total temperature variability.
