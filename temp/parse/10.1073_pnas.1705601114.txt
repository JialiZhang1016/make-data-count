An inescapable consequence of sex in eukaryotes is the evolution
of a biphasic life cycle with alternating diploid and haploid phases.
The occurrence of selection during the haploid phase can have far-
reaching consequences for fundamental evolutionary processes
including the rate of adaptation, the extent of inbreeding depres-
sion, and the load of deleterious mutations, as well as for applied
research into fertilization technology. Although haploid selection is
well established in plants, current dogma assumes that in animals,
intact fertile sperm within a single ejaculate are equivalent at siring
viable offspring. Using the zebrafish Danio rerio, we show that
selection on phenotypic variation among intact fertile sperm within
an ejaculate affects offspring fitness. Longer-lived sperm sired em-
bryos with increased survival and a reduced number of apoptotic
cells, and adult male offspring exhibited higher fitness. The effect
on embryo viability was carried over into the second generation
without further selection and was equally strong in both sexes.
Sperm pools selected by motile phenotypes differed genetically at
numerous sites throughout the genome. Our findings clearly link
within-ejaculate variation in sperm phenotype to offspring fitness
and sperm genotype in a vertebrate and have major implications for
adaptive evolution.

S
perm within an ejaculate exhibit remarkable phenotypic
variation (1), but little is known about the causes and con-
sequences of such variation and selection among sperm pro-
duced by one male [hereafter referred to as “sib sperm” (2, 3)].
The key reason for this lack of knowledge is the current as-
sumption that performance of sperm produced by a male is
under diploid control (4–6), a notion that is further supported by
the apparent lack of association between the phenotypic variation
among sib sperm and their genetic content (7, 8). Nevertheless,
some empirical evidence shows that genes may be expressed at the
haploid stages of spermatogenesis and that the transcripts of these
genes are not always perfectly shared through cytoplasmic bridges
among haploid spermatids (9, 10). Furthermore, the lack of perfect
symmetry in sharing of transcripts among haploid cells suggests
that phenotypic variation within an ejaculate may have a genetic or
epigenetic basis and hence be under selection (11, 12).
Theory predicts that genetic/epigenetic variation among sib
sperm may lead to competition between different sperm phe-
notypes for the fertilization of eggs and may translate into dif-
ferential fitness effects in the offspring (3). In fact, two recent
studies suggested a possible link between sperm phenotype and
offspring phenotype: In a broadcast spawning ascidian, Styela
plicata, longer-lived sperm sired offspring with higher early-life
survival (13), and in the Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, sperm with
intermediate longevity sired faster-hatching offspring (14). How-
ever, no published study to date has separated sperm aging
from the underlying genetic or epigenetic variation among sib
sperm or has provided insights into the long-term fitness effects of
variation in sperm phenotypes within a single ejaculate. There-
fore our current understanding of the importance of selection
at the gametic stage for Darwinian fitness continues to be
incomplete.
Results and Discussion
Here we demonstrate that different cohorts of sperm phenotypes
and genotypes, which exhibit varying levels of longevity and
differentially affect offspring fitness, coexist within the ejaculate
of a single male. We used the externally fertilizing zebrafish
Danio rerio for a series of experiments using in vitro fertilizations
(IVF) in which we selected on sperm phenotypes based on their
longevity. Zebrafish gametes activate upon contact with water,
and IVF allows precise control over the activation and fertil-
ization of gametes as well as gamete numbers. Selection on
sperm longevity was performed by experimentally manipulating
the timing between sperm activation and fertilization. We di-
vided the ejaculate of a male and the eggs of a female into two
cohorts each and exposed each sperm cohort to one of two treat-
ments. Sperm were activated with water; then, in the “short acti-
vation time” (SAT) treatment, one of the sperm cohorts was
immediately added to one of the egg cohorts. In the “long activation
Significance
Diploid organisms produce haploid gametes for sexual re-
production, resulting in a biphasic life cycle. Although selection
during the diploid phase is well understood, selection during
the haploid gametic stage and its consequences are largely
ignored despite its potential importance for fundamental
evolutionary processes, including the rate of adaptation and
inbreeding depression, as well as for applied research into
fertilization technology. A current dogma assumes that in an-
imals selection on the haploid gametic genotype is minimal.
We examined the importance of haploid selection in the
zebrafish and found strong fitness consequences of selection
on sperm phenotype in the resulting offspring. Genomic data
support the idea that these effects may well be the conse-
quence of selection on the haploid sperm genotype.

time” (LAT) treatment, the sperm in the other cohort were
held until about 50% were no longer motile, and then the sperm
were added to the second egg cohort. Thus, the LAT treatment
directly selected against short-lived sperm. So that the fertilization
opportunity was equal in the two treatments, we doubled the
amount of sperm present in the LAT treatment to compensate for
the nonmotile sperm (see SI Materials and Methods for more de-
tails). To avoid any effect of egg aging, eggs were used within 1 min
after collection, and previously activated sperm from both treat-
ments were added to each of the two egg clutches at the same
moment.
Our first aim was to describe any association between variation
in sperm longevity and offspring fitness and to estimate its im-
portance (experiment 1 A and B). Using the split design de-
scribed above, we performed IVF and measured fitness traits of
the resulting offspring from early development to adulthood. In
experiment 1A, we measured sperm longevity for every male and
calculated the time until 50% of sperm were no longer motile.
We evaluated the effect of sperm selection on early offspring
survival in 57 families and found that offspring sired by LAT
sperm exhibited a 7% increase in survival compared with off-
spring sired by SAT sperm (treatment: χ2
1 = 15.93; P < 0.0001,
time: χ2
1 = 6.24, P = 0.012) (Fig. 1A). Moreover, when mea-
suring sperm swimming velocity in one to three sons from each
of 35 families (n = 108 sons), we observed that sons sired by
LAT sperm produced significantly faster-swimming sperm than
their brothers sired by SAT sperm (about 5 μm/s faster in LAT
males at 10 s postactivation) [curvilinear velocity (VCL):

(Fig. 1C).
We repeated this experiment with a different selection pro-
tocol to verify the robustness of our results and to perform fur-
ther fitness assays on offspring. Because the variation in sperm
longevity among males observed in experiment 1A was relatively
small, we simplified our protocol to standardize the time post-
activation in the LAT treatment to 25 s; this change resulted in a
reduction of motile sperm to ∼50% in the LAT treatment (ex-
periment 1B). Using a total of 39 families, we found that off-
spring from the LAT treatment exhibited a 5% increase in
viability at 24 h postfertilization (hpf) (treatment: χ2
1 = 30.86,
P < 0.0001) (Fig. 1B), supporting our original findings. We
measured sperm from three to five sons from each of 34 fami-
lies in the two treatments (n = 264 sons). Sons resulting from
the LAT treatment produced ejaculates that again exhibited

males resulting from the SAT treatment) (treatment: χ2

and a 20% higher sperm density (χ2
1 = 728.8, P < 0.0001) (Fig.
1E) than their SAT brothers.
To understand further how embryo development may be af-
fected by sperm selection during the first 24 hpf, we examined
the occurrence of apoptotic cells (15), which are a potential in-
dicator of embryonic fitness (16, 17), in embryos at the age of
8 hpf (experiment 4) (Fig. 2 A and B). We used a total of six pairs
to perform split IVFs as described for experiment 1. More eggs
exhibited apoptotic cells when fertilized by SAT sperm than
when fertilized by LAT sperm (treatment: χ2
1 = 6.56, P = 0.010)
(Fig. 2C). This difference may reflect either a general increase in
apoptosis in SAT embryos or a shift in the timing of apoptosis
events as part of normal development.
We then measured the reproductive success of adult male and
female offspring resulting from experiment 1B by assessing
number and quality of offspring resulting from natural matings
with nonexperimental fish by setting up pairs comprising one
experimental fish and one nonexperimental fish of the opposite
sex. Here we used a total of 26 families and two to four offspring
of either sex in each family in both treatments (n = 202 off-
spring). We found no difference between LAT and SAT females
in fertilization success (χ2
1 = 1.77, P = 0.18) (Fig. 3A) or in the
total number of eggs produced (χ2
1 = 2.40, P = 0.12) (Fig. 3B).
However, fertilization success was higher in LAT males by about
4% (χ2
1 = 31.87, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 3A), and females mated to
LAT males produced about 20% more eggs (fertilized and
unfertilized) than females mated to SAT males (χ2
1 = 17.19, P <
0.0001) (Fig. 3B). The difference in fertility in females mated to
experimental males is likely induced by behavioral patterns
based on sperm numbers available. In zebrafish, pairs spawn in
bouts initiated by the male; females release several (5–20) eggs
during each bout until the female has run out of eggs or the male
stops courting (18). Furthermore, we found a higher survival rate
in offspring of LAT females (treatment: χ2
1 = 4.43, P = 0.035)
(Fig. 3C) but not males (treatment: χ2
1 = 0.28, P = 0.60) and a
higher percentage of normal embryos among the offspring from
matings between LAT offspring of both sexes and nonex-
perimental fish than among matings between SAT offspring of
both sexes and nonexperimental fish (treatment: χ2
1 = 129.82,
P < 0.0001; sex: χ2
1 = 20.00, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 3D). Our results
show that fitness traits were strongly affected by sperm selection
not only in the immediate offspring but also in the F2 generation
when crossed with nonexperimental fish. The finding of sex
differences in fitness effects—that LAT males have a clear fit-
ness advantage, producing more offspring than SAT males, but
LAT females do not have this advantage over SAT females—is
intriguing and may provide a possible explanation for the main-
tenance of variation in sperm phenotypes.
Our LAT treatment resulted in a decrease in fertilization
success by about 5% despite doubling the amount of sperm in
experiments 1 A and B (Fig. S1; see SI Materials and Methods for
details), but this difference in fertilization success is unlikely to
cause the fitness differences observed between the two treat-
ments for two reasons. First, decreasing fertilization success and
resulting potential selection among eggs for sperm did not have
any fitness effects on offspring in a similar setup (14). Second, in
our outcrosses between experimental fish and wild-type fish, the
fertilization success was about 4% higher in the LAT treatment
than in the SAT treatment in males (Fig. 3A), i.e., opposite the
pattern found in experiment 1 A and B. However, the survival
rate was again higher in the offspring from LAT fish than from
SAT fish (Fig. 3C). We therefore conclude that fertilization
success has no impact on our results.
An immediate question arising from these results is whether the
effects observed in experiment 1 A and B are the result of the
selection of sperm cohorts differing in phenotype or are the result
of sperm aging. Sperm aging, before or after ejaculation, may af-
fect the epigenetic composition of the sperm (19) and/or the
quality of sperm DNA by inducing deleterious mutations (20, 21)
that may, in turn, affect the development of the resulting zygote.
For experiment 2, we investigated the possibility of preejaculation
sperm aging by collecting consecutive sperm subsamples, each
containing 0.8 μL of ejaculate, until the male had no more sperm;
thus the first subsample contained the oldest sperm, and the last
sample contained the youngest (see SI Materials and Methods
for details). This procedure resulted in a maximum of three
subsamples per male from 11 different males. We found no evi-
dence that the subsample identity and hence preejaculation
sperm age had any differential effect on offspring viability (subset
effect: χ2
1 = 0.063, P = 0.97). In many animals, males continuously
release unused sperm, apparently to avoid preejaculation sperm
aging (22–24), and this continuous release may explain the lack of
an effect.
To test for a possible postejaculation sperm-aging effect on
offspring performance, we reduced the osmotic stress on sperm
by increasing the ratio of Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS) to
water during sperm activation before fertilization to extend sperm
lifespan (experiment 3). We divided the ejaculate of a male and the
clutch of eggs of a female (n = 23 pairs) and performed IVF as
described above but activated the sperm 25 s or 50 s before fer-
tilization. Offspring viability during the first 24 hpf did not differ
between the treatments (25 s: dead = 6.6% ± 0.5 SD; 50 s: dead =
6.3% ± 0.6 SD; treatment: χ2
1 = 1.36, P = 0.24). Thus,

postejaculation sperm aging has no impact on offspring perfor-
mance in this system, and the increase in the viability of off-
spring sired by LAT sperm is not a result of sperm aging. We
conclude that our experimental protocol allows selection on
sperm cohorts within an ejaculate that differ in fertilization
success and longevity. This conclusion is further supported by
the observation that selection for long-lived sperm resulted in
increased offspring fitness in every trait that we examined, the
opposite of what would be predicted if degradation arising
from sperm aging had occurred.
A possible mechanism underlying the observed differences
between LAT and SAT treatments is a trade-off between
sperm swimming speed and sperm longevity (25). Swimming
speed is assumed to play a major role in fertilization success in
external fertilizers (26), and if such a trade-off occurred in our
system the fast, short-lived sperm could fertilize eggs in our
SAT treatment, whereas the slow, longer-lived sperm could
fertilize eggs in our LAT treatment. This assumption also
would imply that slower, longer-lived sperm sire offspring with
increased fitness. However, when looking for such a trade-off
within the ejaculates of six males, we found no evidence for
any significant association between these two traits when
tracking individual sperm over time (Fig. S2; see SI Materials
and Methods for details). Therefore an alternative and more
likely scenario, independent of swimming speed, is that SAT
offspring may be sired by both short-lived and long-lived sperm,
whereas LAT offspring are sired only by long-lived sperm. Of
course, the possibility that other traits may determine variation
in fertilization success among sib sperm needs to be explored
carefully.
An open question is whether within-ejaculate sperm variation
is based on genetic mechanisms. To test for a genetic difference
between haploid sperm phenotypes, we performed in vitro assays
to separate sperm within an ejaculate according to their ability to
survive and cover a certain distance throughout their motile
phase. We then examined allele frequencies at heterozygous
paternal sites throughout the genome, comparing the separated
pools in three different males. We placed a sample of the ejac-
ulate of one male in the center of a 280-μL water droplet har-
bored in a concave microscope slide. The droplet was framed
with a concentrated glucose solution to provide a dilution gra-
dient attracting sperm toward the edges of the droplet (27).
Upon contact with water, sperm were activated and dispersed
within the water droplet, and longer-lived sperm were expected
to reach the outer edge of the water droplet more frequently
than short-lived sperm. Although this selection regime is not
identical to the selection regime in the experiments described
above, we know that longer-lived sperm cover longer distances
(see Fig. S3 and SI Materials and Methods for details), and hence
sperm collected from the outer edges of the droplet will show
phenotypic overlap with LAT sperm (Fig. S3). Sperm pools col-
lected from the center will contain a mix of all sperm, including
some nonmotile sperm, which would sire no offspring in our SAT
treatment. The center and outer pools, each containing many
thousands of sperm, as well as an untreated sperm pool and a
finclip from each of the three males, were subjected to whole-
genome sequencing to ∼60× coverage after a PCR-free library
preparation to reduce bias in allelic ratios (Table S4). We mapped
reads to the D. rerio Zv9 reference assembly, determined hetero-
zygous paternal sites using reads from finclips, and then conducted
statistical tests of sperm pool allele frequencies at these paternal
sites using 400-kbp half-overlapping windows throughout the ge-
nome of each male. We checked for two possible sources of allele
frequency bias. First, we checked for allele transmission bias
from male to sperm by comparing allele counts in finclip reads
and untreated sperm pool reads using allele-frequency like-
lihood ratio tests (LRTs) (28). Second, we checked for han-
dling bias possibly introduced by the in vitro gradient assay by
comparing allele counts in untreated sperm pool reads and
reads from the center-selected sperm pool using LRTs (28).
We found no systematic evidence of transmission bias (Fig. S4)
or handling bias (Fig. S5) for two males; the read pool for un-
selected sperm from a third male (male 32) had an undeter-
mined technical error and could not be used.
We then tested for differences in allele frequency by com-
paring the allele counts in the reads from the two selected sperm
pools (center and outer), using allele-frequency LRTs (28) with
critical values set empirically as equal to or greater than the 99%
quantile of the distribution of likelihood ratios for each male. We
supplemented the LRTs with tests of significant allele-frequency
skews using logarithm of the odds (LOD) scores calculated from
binomial probabilities of allele counts in reads from each selected
pool. Binomial tests could result in no allele-frequency skew in
either pool, in a skew (binomial probability <0.01) in one pool
only, or in opposed skews, i.e., alleles A and a being most frequent
in different pools. As for LRTs, critical values for binomial tests
were set empirically at equal to or greater than the 99% quantile of
the LOD scores for each male (see SI Materials and Methods for
further methodological details). In contrast to the bias checks, we
found differences in allele frequency between selected sperm pools
throughout the genome (Fig. 4 and Fig. S6), although there was
considerable variation among males and between tests. One male
(male 31) showed consistently elevated LRTs in the long arm of
chromosome 4 (Fig. S6), which is unusually repeat-rich (29) and
did not feature in either of its bias comparisons (Figs. S4 and S5).
We will not speculate on the functional basis of these results with
respect to specific genes or genomic regions at this point, because
we need a stronger dataset with more males to support such

Fig. 4.
Genetic differences between selected sperm pools from three males.
Each symbol aggregates allele frequency comparisons at heterozygous sites
within half-overlapping 400-kbp windows containing at least one site/10 kbp
and shows windows in which the given test value is within the 99% quantile
of its distribution for each male. Upward-pointing triangles indicate allele
frequency assessed by LRT. Downward-pointing triangles indicate binomial
tests showing skewed and opposed allele frequencies in selected sperm
pools, via binomial LOD scores. Vertical lines indicate binomial tests showing
skewed allele frequencies in either the central or outer selected sperm pools,
via binomial LOD scores. Color indicates male identity: red, male 31; blue,
male 32; green, male 34.

speculation. Nevertheless, there is clear evidence that genetic
variation accompanies the phenotypic variation among selected
sperm pools and that this variation is not the result of trans-
mission or handling biases.
We provide clear evidence that variation in sperm produced by
the same male in a single ejaculate has pronounced effects on
several fitness-related traits throughout life and that this varia-
tion has a genetic basis. Selection on sperm within the ejaculate
results in reduced occurrence of apoptotic cells during early
development, more viable embryos, and more fit adult offspring.
The sequenced sperm pools further suggest a link between sperm
phenotype and sperm genotype. Such a link may have several
nonmutually exclusive causes, and one possible explanation is
variation in epistatic interactions and hence additive genetic ef-
fects of the different sperm haplotypes. This hypothesis provides
a particularly plausible scenario for the variation in sites diverging
among the sperm pools of the three males. Regardless of the exact
genetic underpinning of our observations, our findings are likely
to have major implications for key evolutionary processes in-
cluding the rate of adaptation (30), the evolution of a sexually
dimorphic recombination rate (31, 32), the load of deleterious
mutations (33), and the extent of inbreeding depression (34).
They also may account for hitherto unexplained patterns of non-
Mendelian inheritance (35) and apparent discrepancies in ob-
served mutation rates (36). In addition, our findings provide
insights that are crucial for clinical and agricultural assisted-
fertilization techniques such as IVF and intracellular sperm in-
jection (ICSI). These techniques omit many if not all naturally
occurring steps of within-ejaculate sperm selection, and the
consequences of such omission need to be understood (1, 37).
Future research therefore should focus on the consequences of
gametic selection in a broad variety of taxa with both external
and internal fertilization.
Materials and Methods
All experiments described here were performed in accordance with the
guidelines and approved by the Swedish Board of Agriculture (Jordbruksverket
approval number C341/11). For a detailed description of materials and methods,
please see SI Materials and Methods.
In a first step we performed IVF experiments using the zebrafish D. rerio in
which we split the male ejaculate and the female clutch of eggs into two
halves. We exposed sperm to one of two treatments differing in the time
from sperm activation to fertilization: SAT, 0 s; LAT, ∼25 s. We repeated this
experiment twice using slightly different selection criteria for SAT and LAT.
We monitored offspring fitness by assessing differences in cell apoptosis
during early developmental stages, embryo survival, sperm swimming ve-
locity, sperm density, and reproductive success.
We tested for preejaculation sperm aging by collecting three successive
sperm samples from each male with the first sample containing the oldest
sperm and the third containing the youngest sperm and tested for post-
ejaculation sperm aging by delaying the time between sperm activation and
fertilization by 25 s or 50 s. Using IVF and a split-clutch design we tested for
differences in embryo survival. Finally, we selected sperm for their swimming
phenotype by placing them in a droplet surrounded by a glucose ring to let
them swim toward the edges. We collected sperm from the center and the
edges of the droplet and sequenced sperm collected from each site, sperm
from an unselected droplet, and a finclip from each male.
