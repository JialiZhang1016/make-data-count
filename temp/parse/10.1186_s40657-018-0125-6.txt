Abstract 
Background:  The White-browed Shortwing (Brachypteryx montana) is widespread from the central Himalayas to the 
southeast Chinese mainland and the island of Taiwan, the Philippines and Indonesia. Multiple subspecies are recog-
nised, and several of these have recently been suggested to be treated as separate species based on differences in 
morphology and songs.
Methods:  We here analyse plumage, morphometrics, songs, two mitochondrial and two nuclear markers, and 
geographical distributions of the two mainland Asian taxa B. m. cruralis and B. m. sinensis and the Taiwanese B. m. 
goodfellowi.
Results:  We conclude that these differ congruently in morphology, songs and DNA. Male B. m. goodfellowi is the 
most divergent in plumage (sexually monomorphic, unlike the two others; male similar to female), and B. m. cruralis 
and B. m. sinensis differ in male plumage maturation. The song of B. m. cruralis is strongly divergent from the others, 
whereas the songs of B. m. sinensis and B. m. goodfellowi are more similar to each other. Brachypteryx m. sinensis and B. 
m. goodfellowi are sisters, with an estimated divergence time 4.1 million years ago (mya; 95% highest posterior distri-
bution [HPD] 2.8–5.5 mya), and B. m. cruralis separated from these two 5.8 mya (95% HPD 4.1–7.5 mya). We also report 
notable range extensions of B. m. sinensis as well as sympatry between this taxon and B. m. cruralis in Sichuan Province, 
China. Brachypteryx m. montana from Java is found to be more closely related to Lesser Shortwing (B. leucophris) and 
Rusty-bellied Shortwing (B. hyperythra) than to the mainland Asian and Taiwanese taxa.
Conclusion:  Our data support a recent proposal to treat the three mainland Asian and Taiwanese taxa as three spe-
cies, separate from B. montana sensu stricto: B. cruralis (central Himalayas to south central China and south Vietnam), B. 
sinensis (north central to southeastern part of mainland China) and B. goodfellowi (Taiwan Island).

Background
The genus Brachypteryx belongs to the family Musci-
capidae, within which it has been suggested to be sis-
ter to the recently reinstated genus Larvivora (Sangster 
et  al. 2010; Zuccon and Ericson 2010). Three species 
are usually recognised in Brachypteryx (White-browed 
Shortwing B. montana, Lesser Shortwing B. leucophris, 
Rusty-bellied Shortwing B. hyperythra; Dickinson and 
Christidis 2014; Gill and Donsker 2018), although 10 
species are recognised by del Hoyo and Collar (2016) 
(see below). Previously, Gould’s Shortwing (Heterox-
enicus stellatus) was also placed in Brachypteryx, but it 
was recently moved to a monotypic genus because of 
its distinct plumage and song (Collar 2005; Rasmussen 
and Anderton 2005; Dickinson and Christidis 2014; del 
Hoyo and Collar 2016; Gill and Donsker 2018), and a 
multilocus phylogenetic analysis has shown Heteroxeni-
cus to be only distantly related to Brachypteryx (Price 
et al. 2014). Also two Indian Western Ghats endemics 
recently placed in the new genus Sholicola (S. major, S. 
albiventris) in the flycatcher subfamily Niltavinae based 
on molecular data (Robin et al. 2017) were previously 
often placed in Brachypteryx.
The White-browed Shortwing (Brachypteryx montana) 
occurs in montane regions from Nepal to southeastern 
mainland China and northwest Thailand and southern 
Vietnam, and on Taiwan Island and several of the islands 
in the Philippines and Indonesia (Fig.  1; continental 
Asian and Taiwan range). Fourteen subspecies are usually 
recognised (Collar 2005; Dickinson and Christidis 2014; 
Clement and Rose 2015; Gill and Donsker 2018). Most 
of the taxa are sexually dimorphic, with males being 
mainly blue-grey with a white supercilium, which is usu-
ally mostly concealed but which can be prominently dis-
played when agitated, and with mostly brown females 
(Collar 2005; Clement and Rose 2015). 
Based on morphological and vocal characteristics, 
Eaton et  al. (2016) split the Indonesian taxa into four 
species, and del Hoyo and Collar (2016) split the entire 
complex into eight allo-/parapatric species. For example, 
the latter authors treated the Himalayan and central Chi-
nese B. m. cruralis, the southeast Chinese B. m. sinensis 
and the Taiwanese B. m. goodfellowi as specifically dis-
tinct from each other as well as from the Philippine and 
Indonesian taxa based on morphology and song. Based 
on two mitochondrial genes and one Z-linked region,

Kyriazis et al. (2018) found deep divergence between the 
Sundaic and Philippine lineages versus mainland Asian 
cruralis and sinensis. Their analysis also suggested that 
the latter two taxa are deeply diverged from each other.
We here review the taxonomic status of the two taxa 
in this complex that occur on the Asian continent (B. m. 
cruralis and B. m. sinensis) and the single one that occurs 
on Taiwan Island (B. m. goodfellowi; Fig. 1). We do this 
by integrating plumage, morphometrics, song and mito-
chondrial and nuclear DNA, in addition to geographical 
distributions. We conclude that all three taxa are more 
appropriately treated as separate species.
Methods
Throughout the paper, we follow the traditional tax-
onomy, treating the three focal taxa as subspecies of 
Brachypteryx montana (Collar 2005; Dickinson and 
Christidis 2014; Clement and Rose 2015; Gill and Don-
sker 2018).
Morphology
Specimens of B. m. cruralis, B. m. sinensis and B. m. good-
fellowi were examined by P.C.R. at the following muse-
ums: American Museum of Natural History, New York, 
USA (AMNH); Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cam-
bridge, Massachusetts, USA (MCZ); the Natural His-
tory Museum, Tring, UK (NHMUK, formerly BMNH); 
National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Insti-
tution, Washington, D.C., USA (NMNH, specimen acro-
nym USNM); and University of Michigan Museum of 
Zoology, Ann Arbor, USA (UMMZ). All available speci-
mens at these museums of B. m. sinensis and B. m. good-
fellowi were measured, while most of them including B. 
m. cruralis were measured at UMMZ. All museum speci-
mens of B. m. sinensis available were from Fujian Prov-
ince, China, i.e. not near the zone of contact discussed 
herein. Plumages were also studied, and documented by 
photographs, of all birds caught in the field.
Specimens were measured for 19 characters: culmen 
length (from skull base); culmen length (from distal 
feathers); bill width (from distal narial edge); bill depth 
(from distal narial edge); flattened wing (wing chord); 
secondary length (from bend of wing to tip of longest 
secondary); primary projection beyond longest second-
ary; length of Primary 1 (P1; numbered ascendantly) 
beyond primary coverts; shortfalls from folded wingtip 
(longest primary) of primaries 1–5; tail length (with cali-
pers inserted between middle two rectrices); tail gradu-
ation (distance from central to outermost rectrices in 
folded tail); tarsus length; tarsus distal width; and hind-
claw length. Univariate statistics were generated and 
tested for equality of means where sample sizes per-
mitted using two-sample t-tests with pooled variances, 
Bonferroni-adjusted to control for Type I error, using 
MyStat (SYSTAT Software, Crane Software International, 
Ltd.). Available sample size of specimens of B. m. good-
fellowi was too small for statistical analysis. A Principal 
Components Analysis (PCA) was done on the same set 
of external measurements (except carpal joint to long-
est secondary length and distal tarsal width, for which 
several specimens were not measured), using a covari-
ance matrix in MyStat. Sexes were analyzed separately, 
and older, largely unspotted juveniles were included with 
the respective sex. Sexing was straightforward due to the 
presence of a white eyebrow in males, except in B. m. 
goodfellowi where both sexes have a white eyebrow, and 
the sex on the label had to be trusted.
Song
Sound recordings of songs were obtained from 57 indi-
viduals (14 B. m. cruralis, 35 B. m. sinensis, 8 B. m. good-
fellowi) (Additional file 1: Table S1; Fig. 1). We used both 
our own recordings and recordings from Xeno-canto 
(www.xeno-canto​.org). Sonograms were produced and 
analysed in Avisoft-SASLab Pro 4.3 (Avisoft Bioacous-
tics, Berlin, Germany). First, we resampled the record-
ings at 22.05 kHz. Then, we created spectrograms with a 
fast Fourier transform length of 256 points, a hamming 
window with a frame size of 100% and an overlap of 50%, 
a frequency resolution of 86  Hz, and a time resolution 
5.8 ms. We measured 15 strophes in sequence per indi-
vidual, or all the strophes in a recording if fewer than 15 
strophes for a certain individual. If a strophe had much 
background noise, we measured the next strophe instead. 
On average, we measured 7 ± 3 (mean ± SD) strophes 
per individual. If a strophe had much background noise 
that affected measuring, we measured the next strophe 
instead. Strophes consist of elements (notes), and dif-
ferent strophes are separated from each other by pauses 
(> 1 s). An element, which is the smallest unit measured, 
is defined as a continuous trace on a spectrogram.
For each strophe, we measured the duration, maximum 
frequency, minimum frequency, mean frequency, band-
width, peak frequency, number of elements, number of 
distinct elements, element rate, maximum element dura-
tion, minimum element duration, maximum element 
bandwidth, minimum element bandwidth, duration of 
first element, duration of last element, peak frequency 
of first element, and peak frequency of last element. Ele-
ment rate is number of elements in a strophe divided by 
duration of strophe. Peak frequency refers to frequency 
associated with the maximum energy. Mean frequency 
is the mean of maximum frequency and minimum fre-
quency. Bandwidth is the difference between maximum 
frequency and minimum frequency. It was difficult to 
set a standard to measure the frequency of harmonics 
Page 4 of 13
Alström et al. Avian Res            (2018) 9:34 
which decrease gradually, so harmonic components 
were neglected. When measuring the maximum and 
minimum frequencies, “clicks” and “harsh” elements with 
gradual decrease in energy were neglected. Sometimes, 
there were several elements with relatively low energy at 
the end of a strophe, which could easily be obscured by 
background noise, especially in recordings with rather 
low quality; these elements were neglected. In total, 17 
variables were measured, and all measurements were 
taken by the same person (C.X.).
We calculated average measurements for each indi-
vidual, and used the means in the following analyses. 
We used a principal component analysis (PCA) with 
varimax rotation to compress the original variables into 
independent principal components (eigenvalues > 1) 
and then used a discriminant function analysis (DFA) to 
determine whether the songs of the three taxa could be 
distinguished. MANOVA was applied to assess overall 
differences between principal components of the differ-
ent taxa, followed by independent sample t test for post 
hoc multiple comparisons. Analysis were carried out in 
SPSS Statistics version 20 (IBM Corp.).
Sonograms for publication were produced in Raven 
Pro 1.5 (Bioacoustics Research Program 2011), and songs 
used for sonograms were deposited in the Avian Vocali-
zations Center (AVoCet; http://www.avoce​t.zoolo​gy.msu.
edu).
DNA
We obtained fresh DNA samples from 15 individuals (7 
B. m. cruralis, 4 B. m. sinensis, 4 B. m. goodfellowi), as 
well as sequences from one additional B. m. cruralis from 
GenBank (Additional file 2: Table S2; Fig. 1). In the phy-
logenetic analyses, we also used previously unpublished 
sequences of B. m. montana and Lesser Shortwing (B. 
leucophris carolinae) and published sequences of Rusty-
bellied Shortwing (B. hyperythra) (Additional file  2: 
Table S2).
DNA was extracted using QIA Quick DNEasy Kit 
(Qiagen, Inc.), according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions, but with 30 µl DTT added to the initial incubation 
step for the extraction from feathers. We sequenced the 
mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb) and NADH dehy-
drogenase subunit 2 (ND2) genes and nuclear myoglobin 
intron 2 (myo) and ornithine decarboxylase introns 6–7 
(ODC) according to the protocols described in Fregin 
et al. (2012).
Sequences were aligned and checked using Geneious 
7.1.9 (Biomatters Ltd.). For the nuclear loci, heterozy-
gous sites were coded as ambiguous. Substitution mod-
els were selected based on the Akaike Information 
Criterion calculated in jModeltest 2.1.7 (Darriba et al. 
2012): GTR + Γ for cytb, HKY + Γ for ND2, HKY + I 
for myo, and GTR + I for ODC. Trees were estimated 
by Bayesian inference using BEAST 1.8.4 (Drummond 
et  al. 2012). Xml files were generated in the BEAST 
utility program BEAUti version 1.8.4 for the follow-
ing analyses: myo and ODC separately; cytb + ND2; 
myo + ODC; and all loci combined. All but single-locus 
datasets were partitioned by locus, and all were ana-
lysed under the best-fit locus-specific model, a strict 
clock and a “birth-death incomplete sampling” tree 
prior with a normal distribution with mean 2.0 and 
standard deviation 1.0 for the growth rate. Default pri-
ors were used for the other parameters. Substitution 
and clock models were unlinked. The analysis was run 
for 500 million generations and sampled every 1000 
generations.
In order to estimate divergence times, the cytb data set 
was analysed in BEAST version 1.8.4 (Drummond et al. 
2012), with the same settings as for the concatenated 
data, except that we applied a strict clock with a nor-
mally distributed clock prior with a mean rate of 0.0105 
substitutions/site/lineage/million years (my) and stand-
ard deviation 0.001, corresponding to a rate of 2.1%/my 
(Weir and Schluter 2008).
Integrative species tree estimation was performed 
using *BEAST (Heled and Drummond, 2010) in BEAST 
1.8.4, with gene trees and species trees estimated simul-
taneously. We ran analyses under the best-fit models, and 
a strict clock prior with the rate fixed to 1 (as per default). 
A piecewise linear population size model with a constant 
root was used as a prior for the multispecies coalescent 
and “birth-death incomplete sampling” as prior on diver-
gence times. Default settings were used for the priors, 
except for the “birth-death mean growth rate”, for which 
a normal prior with initial value 1.0, mean 2.0 and stand-
ard deviation 1.0 was applied. 500 million generations 
were run, sampled every 1000 generations.
In all analyses, convergence to the stationary distri-
bution of the single chains was inspected in Tracer 1.6 
(Rambaut and Drummond 2014). The effective sample 
sizes (ESS) for the joint likelihood and other parameter 
values were > 300 (> 1000 for most parameters), repre-
senting good mixing of the MCMC. We also examined 
convergence and reproducibility by running each analy-
sis three times, with random starting points. The first 
10–25% of generations were discarded as “burn-in”, well 
after convergence was reached. Trees were summarized 
using TreeAnnotator version 1.8.4 (included in BEAST 
package), choosing “Maximum clade credibility tree” and 
“Mean heights”, and displayed in FigTree version 1.4.3 
(Rambaut 2002). Xml files for all analyses and a tree file 
in Newick format for the *BEAST tree are available as

Results
Plumage and bare parts
Adult male
Adult male B. m. cruralis (Fig.  2b) is dark blue-grey 
(“blackish”) all over, with slightly paler grey belly to 
undertail-coverts, diffusely merging into blacker breast; 
the belly feathers have indistinct paler tips, often creating 
a faintly mottled appearance. The lores and uppermost 
throat are jet black, the latter diffusely merging with the 
slightly paler rest of the throat. The supercilium is pure 
white, usually largely concealed over/behind the eye 
except when excited.
Adult male B. m. sinensis (Fig.  2a) is overall consid-
erably paler grey, with grey rather than black lores; the 
uppermost throat is often paler, rather than darker, than 
the rest of the throat; and the belly and undertail-coverts 
are often whitish. The legs are on average blacker in B. 
m. cruralis than in B. m. sinensis. No attempts were made 
to investigate whether there were additional differences 
within the UV spectrum, although it is unlikely that 
additional important differences would be discerned (cf. 
Vorobyev et al. 1998; Håstad and Ödeen 2008).
Brachypteryx m. goodfellowi (Fig. 2e) is sexually mono-
morphic, and adult male is “female-plumaged” (see 
below). Accordingly, adult male B. m. goodfellowi is very 
different from adult male cruralis and sinensis (and first-
winter/-summer sinensis; see below).
Adult female
Adult female B. m. cruralis is uniformly dark brown 
above and on the ear-coverts (latter often with a buffish 
or rufous tinge), and with more rufous-brown edges to 
the uppertail-coverts, remiges and rectrices. The throat, 
breast and flanks are slightly paler brown (upper throat 
marginally paler, with a faint buffish tinge), diffusely 
merging with even paler belly and more rufous undertail-
coverts. The lower forehead is diffusely rufous, and the 
supraloral and eye-ring are also rufous.
Adult female B. m. sinensis differs from adult female B. 
m. cruralis in lacking rufous on the forehead, lores and 
around the eye (just showing an indistinct pale buffish 
eye-ring); and in showing slightly paler throat and breast; 
whitish belly; and paler rufous-buff undertail-coverts. 
The base of the lower mandible appears to be rather pale 
in many B. m. sinensis as opposed to black in B. m. crura-
lis, and the legs paler than in B. m. cruralis (only observed 
on specimens, needs to be confirmed in the field).
Adult female (and adult male; see above) B. m. good-
fellowi resembles adult female B. m. cruralis, but shows 
a prominent white supercilium (mostly concealed over/
behind the eye when not excited); buffish-white belly; 
and paler rufous-buff undertail-coverts.
First‑winter/‑summer male
First-winter/-summer male B. m. cruralis (Fig.  2d, f) 
resembles adult female, but shows a white supercilium, 
which is usually concealed above/behind the eye, and 
mainly or entirely concealed also in front of the eye (but 
easily seen in the hand when feathers are parted). It can 
further be told from adult female by pale rufous edges 
and terminal spots/shaft-streaks to retained juvenile 
(outer) greater coverts (pale spots/shaft-streaks most 
distinct on innermost feathers; same pattern in first-
winter/-summer female).
First-winter/-summer male B. m. sinensis (Fig.  2c) 
resembles adult male, but shows contrastingly browner 
retained juvenile remiges, primary coverts, alula and 
outer greater coverts, latter often with pale rufous/buffish 
spots on tips. Thus, first-winter/-summer B. m. sinensis 
is strikingly different from same-age male B. m. cruralis.
First-winter/-summer male B. m. goodfellowi presum-
ably differs from adults (but not from first-winter/-sum-
mer female) by moult contrasts and pattern of retained 
juvenile greater coverts, but this has not been studied by 
us.
Morphometrics
Although B. m. cruralis and B. m. sinensis are similar in 
overall size, B. m. cruralis has the bill significantly longer 
and, in males, deeper than in B. m. sinensis; a shorter 
distance from carpal joint to tip of longest secondary 
but longer P1; shorter, more graduated (latter at least in 
females) tail that projects significantly less beyond the 
undertail coverts; and longer, heavier tarsus and longer 
hindclaw than B. m. sinensis (Table 1).
Factor scores of most individual B. m. cruralis and 
B. m. sinensis occupied taxon-exclusive morphospace, 
although there was overlap, and the small sample of B. m. 
goodfellowi fell out in the area of morphospace overlap 
(Fig.  3). By far the most important variables contribut-
ing to the differential loading of specimens of B. m. cru-
ralis and B. m. sinensis on PC1 (Table 2) were a contrast 
between tail length plus projection of tail beyond under-
tail coverts (higher scores in B. m. sinensis) versus tarsus 
length (greater in B. m. cruralis). On both PC2 and PC3 
(latter not graphed), wing length and tail graduation were 
the most important variables, but the taxa did not sepa-
rate out well on these components. Within-taxon sexual 
variation was much less than that between B. m. cruralis 
and B. m. sinensis (Fig. 3).
Song
The song of B. m. cruralis (Fig.  4a, b) is a drawn-out 
(3.34 ± 0.78 s) thin, high-pitched (mean peak frequency 
4.63 ± 0.38  kHz) ramble of notes of different pitch and

duration, which give the song an “undulating” quality; it 
often sounds as if it is delivered during one long exhala-
tion, with the end trailing off. The strophes are separated 
by long pauses, usually at least 6 s. Individual males have 
large repertoires, and strophes are usually not repeated 
two or more times in succession.
The song of B. m. sinensis (Fig. 4c–e) is markedly differ-
ent, consisting of much shorter (0.83 ± 0.09 s), on average 
lower-pitched (mean peak frequency 3.93 ± 0.37  kHz) 
strophes, which usually have shorter pauses in between 
(usually 3–8 s). Each strophe is sometimes given several 
times in succession, before switching to another strophe 
type. Individual males have large repertoires.
The song of B. m. goodfellowi (Fig. 4f, g) sounds super-
ficially similar to that of B. m. sinensis, mainly because it 
consists of short, fairly simple strophes. However, analy-
ses of sonograms reveal quite different syntax and pat-
tern, although these differences are difficult to quantify. 
It usually begins with a drawn-out note and often ends 
with a short series of rather brief, often complex, notes

of alternating pitch that is given two or sometimes three 
times (one or a few simple, drawn-out notes are often 
given after the initial note, and very thin, faint notes 
are often given at the very end). In B. m. sinensis, there 
is often an alternation between drawn-out and shorter 
notes, and repeated series of shorter notes are less com-
mon. However, in B. m. sinensis, repetitions of single 
notes multiple times are common, as well as “rolling” 
drawn-out notes (with “serrated edges” in sonograms), 
unlike in B. m. goodfellowi. In our sample of B. m. goodfel-
lowi, repetition of the same strophe twice in succession 
was exceptional.
In the PCA of songs, four components with eigenval-
ues > 1 were extracted from the data set (Table  3). PC1 
was positively correlated with duration, number of ele-
ments, number of different elements, maximum fre-
quency, bandwidth, maximum element bandwidth, peak 
frequency of first element, and negatively correlated with 
minimum frequency; PC2 was positively correlated with 
minimum element duration, peak frequency of last ele-
ment, and negatively correlated with rate; PC3 was nega-
tively correlated with minimum element bandwidth; PC4 
was positively correlated with maximum element dura-
tion, duration of first element (Table  3). A plot of PC1 
versus PC2 revealed three clusters with partial overlap 
(Fig.  5). Brachypteryx m. cruralis was largely separated 
from the others on PC1, and B. m. goodfellowi from the 
others on PC2. The following principal components dif-
fered among the taxa (MANOVA: Pillai’s Trace = 1.555, 
F8,102 = 44.496, p < 0.001). PC1 was significantly different 
among all taxa (p < 0.019); B. m. goodfellowi was signifi-
cantly different from B. m. cruralis and B. m. sinensis on 
PC2 (p < 0.001), while the two latter taxa were not sig-
nificantly different on PC2 (p = 0.243); B. m. cruralis was 
significantly different from B. m. goodfellowi and B. m. 
sinensis on PC3 (p < 0.002), while the two latter taxa were 
not significantly different on PC3 (p = 0.077). PC4 was 
not significantly different among the taxa (p > 0.133).
The DFA correctly classified 96.4% of the individu-
als based on the original song measurements and 94.7% 
based on the mean measurements of all strophes for each 
individual (Table 4). 100% of the B. m. cruralis were cor-
rectly identified, whereas 2.9% of the B. m. sinensis were 
mis-classified as B. m. goodfellowi and 12.5% of the B. m. 
goodfellowi were mis-classified as B. m. sinensis. 
DNA
All analyses of combined mitochondrial and nuclear loci 
supported a sister relationship between B. m. sinensis 
and B. m. goodfellowi, with B. m. cruralis being sister to 
these (Fig. 6). The tree based on the two mitochondrial 
genes was topologically identical to the combined tree, 
but with lower support (0.89) for the clade comprising 
the three focal taxa (Additional file 6: Fig. S2). The tree 
based on the two nuclear introns combined as well as 
single-locus analyses of the introns supported cruralis 
and goodfellowi as monophyletic (0.95–1.00) but failed to 
recover sinensis as monophyletic (Additional file  6: Fig.

S2). The split between B. m. sinensis and B. m. goodfel-
lowi was dated to 4.1 million years ago (mya; 95% high-
est posterior distribution [HPD] 2.8–5.5  mya), in the 
mid-Pliocene, and between these two and B. m. cruralis 
to 5.8 mya (95% HPD 4.1–7.5 mya), in the late Miocene 
(Fig. 6). The analyses also found B. m. montana, B. leu-
cophris carolinae and B. hyperythra to form a clade, with 
a sister relationship and divergence time of 3.9 mya (95% 
HPD 2.7–5.2  mya) between the two former (although 
not strongly supported in all analyses) (Fig. 6; Additional 
file 6: Fig. S2).
Geographical distributions
Brachypteryx m. cruralis and B. m. sinensis were previ-
ously considered widely disjunct, with the former dis-
tributed from the central Himalayas to central China and 
northern Thailand and southern Vietnam, and the latter 
restricted to Guizhou, Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian 
and southern Shaanxi Provinces in southeast China (e.g. 
Cheng 1987; Collar 2005). However, in mid-June 2015, 
we found two singing males of B. m. sinensis in sympa-
try with B. m. cruralis at 2860–2870 m in Wolong Nature 
Reserve in Sichuan Province, China (Figs. 1, 2, 4, 6). One 
male B. m. sinensis and one male B. m. cruralis appar-
ently had overlapping territories, as both were attracted 
to the same spot by playback of their own song, but did 
not show any response to the other taxon’s song. We 
have also examined one sound recording by Mike Nelson 
(XC265947) of a B. m. sinensis from Wolong, at 1600 m 
in late May. Brachypteryx m. cruralis is fairly common in 
Wolong. Brachypteryx m. goodfellowi is endemic to Tai-
wan Island (Fig. 1).
Discussion
Brachypteryx montana cruralis, B. m. sinensis and B. m. 
goodfellowi differ congruently in adult and first-winter/-
summer plumage and song, and their genetic divergences 
are substantial, with estimated divergences in the late 
Miocene to mid-Pliocene. Kyriazis et  al. (2018) found 
even deeper divergence between B. m. cruralis and B. m. 
sinensis than we did (> 9  mya). The difference between 
our estimate and the one by Kyriazis et al. (2018) is likely 
due to the use of different loci and different molecular 
clock calibrations. We note that the most recent com-
mon ancestor for the five taxa in our study (6.99 mya) is 
very similar to that estimated for the common ancestor 
of B. montana cruralis, B. leucophris and B. hyperythra 
(7.15 mya) in the study of Himalayan songbirds by Price 
et  al. (2014) using multiple fossil calibrations (sinensis 
and goodfellowi not analysed). The divergences among 
the three continental taxa are rather close to or consid-
erably deeper than among B. m. montana from Java, B. 
leucophris carolinae and B. hyperythra. There are also

differences in sexual dimorphism between the three taxa 
(B. m. goodfellowi being monomorphic, unlike the two 
others) and male plumage maturation (first-winter/-sum-
mer male B. m. cruralis being “female-like”, unlike same-
age male B. m. sinensis). We also detected statistically 
significant differences in structure between B. m. cruralis 
and B. m. sinensis, although these overlap; B. m. good-
fellowi is intermediate in morphometrics, although our 
sample size of the latter is too small to test statistically 
(all taxa had overlapping clusters in the PCA). Moreover, 
we have found B. m. cruralis and B. m. sinensis in sym-
patry in the breeding season in Sichuan Province, China, 
with seemingly overlapping territories, but no evidence 
of intertaxon territoriality. Taken together, these facts 
suggest that all three taxa should be treated as separate 
species.
Our suggestion to treat B. m. cruralis, B. m. sinen-
sis and B. m. goodfellowi as three different species is in 
agreement with the treatment by del Hoyo and Collar 
(2016), which was based on differences between the two 
former in plumage (“score 6” according to their scoring 
system) and song [“rather longer, more warbled (at least 
1)” in cruralis]; and differences between B. goodfellowi 
and the two others in plumage (especially sexual mono-
morphism: “score 4”) and “notably longer bill” (“score 
2”), but no difference in song (in total “score 8”). While 
we concur that plumage differences are pronounced 
between all three taxa, our measurements (Table  1) do 
not bear out the statement by del Hoyo and Collar (2016) 
that the bill is notably longer in B. m. goodfellowi than in 
B. m. cruralis, and a larger sample of B. m. goodfellowi 
would likely show it to be similar in bill length to B. m. 
cruralis and that both are significantly longer-billed than 
B. m. sinensis.
The present study does not analyse the Philippine and 
Indonesian taxa in this complex, but all of those that have 
recently been suggested to be different species, includ-
ing Javan B. m. montana, are at least as different-looking 
from the three mainland and Taiwanese taxa as these are 
from each other (del Hoyo and Collar 2016; Eaton et al. 
2016). Moreover, the ancient divergence between the tree 
continental/Taiwanese taxa and B. m. montana, and the 
fact that B. leucophris, which is sympatric with both B. 
m. cruralis and B. m. sinensis, is more closely related to 
B. m. montana than B. m. montana is to B. m. cruralis 
and B. m. sinensis, support splitting the tree continen-
tal/Taiwanese taxa from B. m. montana. In other words, 
the two Asian mainland species should be referred to as 
B. cruralis and B. sinensis, and the Taiwanese one as B. 
goodfellowi. del Hoyo and Collar (2016) proposed the 
English names Himalayan Shortwing for the first, Chi-
nese Shortwing for the second, and Taiwanese Shortwing 
for the third.
Clement and Rose (2015) stated that first-winter/-sum-
mer (“first-year”) male B. cruralis has “blue bases (under-
lying olive-brown tips) to crown, nape and upperparts, 
to inner webs of wing-coverts and flight and tail feathers, 
which become progressively deeper blue on head and 
upperparts”. This strongly disagrees with our experience, 
though it seems to match some adult females. Moreover, 
the white supercilium, which distinguishes first-winter/-
summer male from females of all ages, is not mentioned 
in their main text, but is shown on the plate and men-
tioned in the caption to the same.
We note that in males, B. sinensis has the fastest plum-
age maturation, as the first-winter/-summer plumage is 
adult-like, whereas it takes one additional year for B. cru-
ralis to reach adult plumage. In contrast, B. goodfellowi 
never obtains a distinct male plumage, and might be con-
sidered paedomorphic.
Conclusion
We agree with a recent suggestion based exclusively on 
studies of morphology and songs (del Hoyo and Collar 
2016) that the two continental Asian and single Taiwan-
ese taxa in the Brachypteryx montana complex are bet-
ter treated as three distinct species, which are specifically 
different from B. montana sensu stricto: B. cruralis, B. 
sinensis and B. goodfellowi. This is based on concordant 
differences in morphology, songs and DNA, as well as 
sympatry in the breeding season between the two conti-
nental taxa.
