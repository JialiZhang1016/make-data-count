In the present work, the aerodynamic performance of the full helicopter PSP in hover ﬂight is investigated 
using a simpliﬁed concept of multiple reference frame (MRF) technique in the context of high-order 
Monotone Upstream Centred Scheme for Conservation Laws (MUSCL) cell-centred ﬁnite volume method. 
The predictions were obtained for two ground distances and several collective pitch angle at tip Mach 
number of 0.585. The calculations were made for both out-of-ground-effect (OGE) and in-ground-effect 
(IGE) cases and compared with experimental data in terms of pressure distribution and integrated thrust 
and torque and vortex system.

1. Introduction
The brownout phenomenon is often experienced in helicopters 
in ground effect (IGE) when landing, take-off or hovering in dusty 
environments, where the particles cloud obscure the pilot’s vision 
of the terrain and consequently decreases substantially the safety. 
This ﬂight operation is usual on medical services on beaches and 
army operations on desert environments. Understanding the rotor 
downwash wake is crucial to improve not only the safety of the 
surrounding but also the rotor performance. Predicting helicopter 
aerodynamics and the surrounding ﬂowﬁeld challenges most Com-
putational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solvers as it requires a low nu-
merical dissipation to accurate predict the blade forces and the 
vortex dominated ﬂow.
Over the years, numerical simulation of the helicopter in 
ground effect has progressed from theoretical models [1] and free 
wake models [2] to full block structured CFD analysis [3]. The GOA-
HEAD project conducted an extensive wind tunnel measurements

of a fully instrumented 4-bladed helicopter model out of ground 
effect (OGE). This database was used to compare with CFD simula-
tions [4–6]. Kalra et al. [7] studied the effect of different tip shapes 
on a hovering rotor near ground comparing the tip vortex trajec-
tory and core size against experimental results. Jacobson et al. [8]
presented a hybrid methodology with CFD and free wake models 
to predict the thrust and torque performance and vortex trajectory 
of the hovering S-76 scaled rotor. Hwang et al. [9] assessed the 
ground effect of the isolated rotor S-76 hovering for three blade tip 
geometries using overset unstructured meshes. Hu et al. [10] de-
veloped a hybrid CFD coupled with discrete element to study the 
dust and dispersion of sediments with the ground effect. Pasquali 
et al. [11] performed a numerical and experimental correlation to 
predict the tip vortex trajectories and rotor performance. Rovere 
et al. [12] carried out a numerical analysis of a micro rotor in 
ground effect and validated it with experimental data. The results 
were used to assess several safety factors by using force estima-
tors on ground personnel and particle tracking. The AIAA Hover 
Prediction Workshop (HPW) has established a strong group with 
members from industry, government agencies, and academia to as-
sess the current state-of-art of the numerical works on helicopter 
ﬂows and identify the needs and future of hover prediction. Jain 
[13] studied the inﬂuence of the facility on the rotor aerodynam-
ics. Park et al. [14] performed full rotor and isolated analysis of the

Pressure Sensitive Paint (PSP) rotor using transitional turbulence 
modelling. The wake breakdown has been extensively studied by 
Abras [15–17]. Carnes developed an Ampliﬁcation Factor Transport 
model to study the effect of crossﬂow transition on hovering ro-
tors. Silva et al. [18] presented the development of a new multiple 
reference frame domain decomposition to assess the IGE and OGE 
on isolated rotors.
In the present work, an unstructured hybrid mesh open-source 
CFD code is used to simulate the Pressure Sensitive Paint rotor 
with the Robin-Mod7 fuselage hovering near ground. Solutions are 
obtained using the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model with rota-
tional correction. The governing equations are discretised using 
the absolute velocity formulation, the Harten-Lax-van-Leer-Contact 
(HLLC) Riemann solver [19], the spatial discretisation employs the 
[20] MUSCL-MOGE variant limiter of Tsoutsanis [21]. The solu-
tion is advanced in time is with the block Jacobi implicit back-
ward Euler time integration. The CFD solver labelled Unstructured 
Compressible Navier-Stokes 3D (UCNS3D) [22] which is validated, 
assessed and evaluated across a wide range of ﬂow conditions 
[18,23–34]. The out of ground case is used to validate the results 
of pressure distribution and integrated loads. The ground effect is 
compared with the previous case using quantitative data of the 
aerodynamic performance and the qualitative analysis of the vor-
tex system. Isosurfaces of q criteria are also used to investigate the 
interaction between the disturbed ﬂow with and ground and the 
fuselage.
2. Numerical methodology
The unstructured, compressible, Navier-Stokes and three-dimen-
sional open source code UCNS3D [22] is used as CFD solver this 
study. It solves the governing equations with several high-order 
spatial discretisation schemes including several MUSCL and WENO 
variants across a wide range of ﬂow conditions [23–32,35,36]. 
The Reynolds Averaged Navier-stokes (RANS) governing equations 
is discretised by using cell-centred ﬁnite volume method where 
the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model is employed. The Mono-
tone Upstream-centred Schemes for Conservation Laws (MUSCL) 
[37,38] are used to provide 3rd order accuracy in space. The gov-
erning equations are formulated in a multiple reference frame, the 
Harten-Lax-van-Leer-Contact (HLLC) Riemann solver [20] with the 
MUSCL-MOGE variant limiter of Tsoutsanis [21] computes the in-
viscid ﬂuxes. The frame of reference is deﬁned at the solver level 
with no need of mesh-based interface. The velocity components 
are computed in absolute formulation within the appropriate ﬂux 
correction according to the element frame of reference, for a more 
detailed description of the implementation and validation of this 
technique the reader must refer to [18]. The solution advances 
in time with the implicit backward Euler time integration with a 
local time-stepping strategy. The Block Jacobi relaxation method 
solves the linear system of equation in which the Jacobian on the 
non-inertial source terms are included on the lower and upper 
diagonalization pre-conditioning to improve the stability on high 
Courant-Friedricks-Lewy (CFL) numbers. The ﬂow solver is paral-
lelized using the ParMeTis grid partitioning and hybrid MPI/OMP 
paradigm for improving the computational eﬃciency.
3. Geometries and grids
The four-bladed Pressure Sensitive Paint (PSP) rotor was simu-
lated to investigate the ground effect on a full helicopter conﬁgu-
ration. The experiment for the PSP rotor was developed by NASA 
Langley Research center with the main purpose of investigating 
the rotor performance and the natural and forced transition of the 
ﬂow over the blades [39]. The geometric information of the ro-
tor and fuselage are summarized in Table 1 and 2, respectively.

The model scaled PSP rotor consists of RC-series airfoil linearly 
twisted by −14◦with radius of 66.5 inches. The blade has the 
reference chord of 5.45 inches and aspect ratio of 12.2. The ex-
periment was carried out with the blades operating at Mach tip 
number of 0.585. The Robin-Mod7 geometry is deﬁned by analyt-
ical shape functions given the experimental and numerical work 
carried out by NASA and ONERA [40]. In the present work, the 
geometry was collected on [41] in which the shape coeﬃcients 
were modiﬁed for the mod7 conﬁguration. The fuselage length is 
123.931 inches with shaft angle of −3.5◦down with the rotor. A 
detailed geometry description of the rotor and fuselage positioning 
can be found in [42].
The computational domain has a cylindrical shape with 10.6 m 
radius and 22.7 m length, similarly to the facility test setup. The 
mesh sizes for the blade and fuselage for all cases are listed in 
Table 3. The blade unstructured surface grid used in the present 
study was collected from the AIAA Rotorcraft Hover Prediction 
Workshop (HPW) [43]. To capture the boundary layer in detail, 
44 prismatic layers were extruded on the normal direction with 
a 1.2 grown rate, the height of the ﬁrst element is positioned at 
1.6 × 10−6 from the wall surface to insure y+ < 1. The near-body 
mesh blocks for the four blades contain around 7.4 million ele-
ments for both IGE and OGE computations. Local reﬁnement with 
a mesh size of 10% of the reference chord was applied in the vicin-
ity of the blade tips and in the near wake region between the 
rotor and the ground to better resolve the blade tip vortices, as 
can be seen in Fig. 1. The non-slip wall condition was applied on

the blade’s and fuselage surface The farﬁeld boundary condition 
was used on the outer surfaces. On IGE simulations, the ground 
was treated as free-slip wall to avoid an excessive number of ele-
ments at this location.
4. Results
The hover solutions near ground are highly unsteady with chal-
lenging convergence. The set of equations is numerically stiff, as 
it has near-zero velocity on parts of domain in addition to strong 
source terms due to the non-inertial forces. In all simulations, the 
steady state solutions are obtained with the implicit block Jacobi 
iteration algorithm based on local time-stepping, which is largely 
used for high-Reynolds ﬂows on unstructured grids as it is free 
of matrix inversion and has moderate memory requirements at 
reasonable convergence rate [44]. The convergence solutions were 
achieved within at least 104 iteration steps using CFL number of 
15.
In Fig. 2 the pressure coeﬃcient C p along the chord are com-
pared with experimental data at two radial stations (r/R = 0.93 −
0.99) at three thrust coeﬃcient: Ct = 0.05, 0.07, 0.09. Two exper-
imental techniques were used to measured the C p distribution: 
kulite transducers and pressure sensitive paint. Overall, for the 
OGE CFD predicts the C p curve at a reasonable level of agreement 
compared with both experimental techniques. Small discrepancies 
are observed at leading edge at higher thrust. Other works using 
high-order solutions under the same ﬂow conditions present simi-
lar values [45]. Regarding the effect of the ground on the pressure 
coeﬃcient distribution (blue and red lines), overall, the main dif-
ference is related to the pressure coeﬃcient C p at the leading edge, 
in which large values are found on IGE results. An exception is seen 
at Ct = 0.09 at the tip blade, in which the ground proximity de-
creases the pressure coeﬃcient peak.
In Fig. 3, the predicted thrust coeﬃcient (Ct), torque coeﬃ-
cient (Cq), and ﬁgure of merit (FoM) of the OGE case (solid black 
square)are compared with two experimental data: natural tran-
sition (open red circle) and forced transition (open square). The 
main difference between this two experimental datasets is the in-
stallation of trip dots on the blade upper/lower surface at chosen 
locations to measure the boundary layer transition or blade aeroe-
lastic deﬂection [13]. As there is no experimental and numerical 
data of the ground inﬂuence using this rotor, the IGE computations 
are only for comparative purpose. It is shown that for the OGE, the 
predicted torque and thrust and ﬁgure of merit agrees well with 
the experiment. At low Ct, the present work overpredicts the FoM 
which may be due the turbulence modelling at this ﬂow condition, 
as according to [42] at this operational point the blades surface 
experiences a transitional turbulent ﬂow. It can also be seen that, 
the presence of the ground slightly changes the slope of the ro-
tor performance curve. This is also seen on other rotors such as 
S-76 [9,46] which has similar geometry and ﬂow condition. To fur-
ther investigate the effect of ground, the predicted results for the 
three collective pitch angles (θc = 7, 9, 11◦) are summarized in Ta-
ble 4. The results show that, the increment of thrust and torque on 
the rotor varies no only due to the ground presence but also with 
the pitch angle. At θc = 7◦and 9◦the rise is more substantial on 
thrust and torque calculations accordingly to the ground distance. 
For θc = 11◦the increment ratio is considerable lower in compar-
ison with other collective pitch angles. The FoM increases around 
3% on Z/R=1.0 and 10% on Z/R=0.75 for all collective pitch angles, 
apart from θc = 11◦in which experiences only a marginal rise of 
1% at Z/R=1.0 and 3% at Z/R=0.75. The change on the sign of the 
integrated thrust on the fuselage from OGE to IGE computations 
shows the effect of the fountain ﬂow generated below the fuselage 
with the ground presence.
In Fig. 4, the pressure coeﬃcient contours, computed with the 
freestream velocity equal to the Mach tip, are shown with the 
range from -0.05 to 0.45. Comparing the IGE and OGE simulations, 
the distribution of pressure at the noose and the tail of the fuse-
lage presents similar patterns and locations. The main difference is 
at the left/right side of the fuselage in which the pressure drop is 
smoother due to the fountain ﬂow originated from the jet impinge-
ment on the ground. This feature seems to be the main contributor 
for the sign change of the predicted net vertical forces acting on 
the fuselage previously shown in Table 4. On IGE is also seen larger 
pressure ﬂuctuation at the upper surface which is related to the 
bigger recirculating ﬂow at stronger downwash.
In Fig. 5, the vorticity contours at the front and side planes 
are compared between IGE and OGE simulations at θc = 9◦. In 
Fig. 6, these wake structures are represented in by isosurfaces of 
q-criterion coloured by vorticity magnitude. The predicted wake 
structures are well resolved by the current solver for both near 
ground and off ground ﬂow condition. In the case of OGE, the 
effect of aspect ratio of the fuselage on the radial evolution of 
the tip vortex can be seen by a comparison of the side and front 
slices of vorticity contours seen in Fig. 5. The noose and tail of 
the fuselage slightly changes the tip vortex trajectory. The q crite-
ria isosurface seen in Fig. 6 shows ring vortex is seen downstream 
the rotor and it is also noticeable broken vortices structures origi-
nated from the interaction of the fuselage with the turbulent ﬂow, 
especially on the tail. On IGE, the tip vortex ﬁrst experiences a ra-

dially contraction, as in the OGE case, and then it expands due 
to the ground and fuselage presence as can be seen in the curva-
ture of the jet wake downstream the rotor in Fig. 5. The tip vortex 
rolls up radially due to the effect of the disturbed incoming ﬂow 
from the fuselage and the ground. Previous work on isolated ro-
tors [9] shows that the radial expansion on IGE occurs after 180◦
wake age and is more evident when the rotor within close proxim-
ity to the ground [18]. On the close proximity of the ground it can 
be seen horse shoe vortices structures originated from upcoming 
ﬂow, which promote the ground vortex roll-up spreading radially 
forming a ring-like vortex as depicted in Fig. 6. Since the ground 
surface is treated as free-slip it may also being artiﬁcially increas-
ing this radial expansion. On both IGE and OGE simulations, the 
fuselage interaction is more clear at the tail, especially with the 
tip vortex which breaks down in contact with the wall and even-
tually rolls up and embracing it as gets close to the end.

5. Conclusion
In the present paper, full helicopter was studied with the 
ground and without ground effect in the ucns3d high-order un-
structured CFD solver. The governing equations were solved in 
multiple reference frame fashion in which the domain decompo-
sition is performed at the solver level. The calculations were made 
at a tip Mach number of 0.585 and for collective pitch angles from 
7 to 11 degrees. The numerical solutions were compared with ex-
perimental data such as pressure coeﬃcient distribution, thrust 
and torque coeﬃcients and ﬁgure of merit. The wake structure for 
both IGE and OGE conditions were also analysed. It was observed 
that the predicted thrust and torque of IGE is considerable higher 
on IGE, for the same collective pitch angle. As a result, the rotor 
performance curve in terms of Ct/σ and FoM changes its slope 
within the rotor distance from the ground. It is also seen that on 
IGE, the fuselage present smoother pressure difference at left/right 
side. The qualitative features of the wake were also well predicted 
to demonstrate the interaction with the tip vortex with the fuse-
lage and the ground. It was shown that MRF method coupled with 
the high-order spatial accuracy is well capable of predicting ac-
curately the aerodynamic performance of full helicopter in hover 
with and without the ground effect.
