Abstract
Landscapes evolve in response to prolonged and/or intense precipitation resulting
from atmospheric processes at various spatial and temporal scales. Whereas synoptic (large‐scale) features
(e.g., atmospheric rivers and hurricanes) govern regional‐scale hydrologic hazards such as widespread
ﬂooding, mesoscale features such as thunderstorms or squall lines are more likely to trigger localized
geomorphic hazards such as landslides. Thus, to better understand relations between hydrometeorological
drivers and landscape response, a knowledge of mesoscale meteorology and its impacts is needed. Here
we investigate the extreme geomorphic response associated with one type of mesoscale meteorological
feature, the narrow cold frontal rainband (NCFR). Resulting from low‐level convergence and shallow
convection along a cold front, NCFRs are narrow bands of high‐intensity rainfall that occur in midlatitude
areas of the world. Our study examines an NCFR impacting the Sierra Nevada foothills (California, USA)
that initiated over 500 landslides, mobilized ~360,000 metric tons of sediment to the ﬂuvial system (as much
as 16 times the local annual sediment yield), and severely damaged local infrastructure and regional
water transport facilities. Coupling geomorphological ﬁeld investigations with meteorological analyses, we
demonstrate that precipitation associated with the NCFR was both intense (maximum 15 min intensity of
70 mm/hr) and localized, resulting in a highly concentrated band of shallow landsliding. This
meteorological phenomenon likely plays an important role in landscape evolution and hazard initiation.
Other types of mesoscale meteorological features also occur globally and offer new avenues for
understanding the effects of storms on landscapes.
Plain Language Summary Major storms can cause extreme and hazardous landscape
disturbances, but links between storm conditions and landscape response such as erosion and landslides
remain poorly constrained. This is partly due to the lack of attention generally given to the ﬁner‐scale details
of storms. We examined one type of atmospheric feature that is common in western North America
(as well as in other regions), the narrow cold frontal rainband, and studied its effects on the landscape. In
2018, one such event in the Tuolumne River watershed, California, caused more than 500 landslides in a
narrow area, moving more sediment in one day than the river would normally transport in a year. We ﬁnd
that landscape change, including potentially hazardous events such as landslides, can be driven primarily by
ﬁne‐scale rainfall patterns rather than by the larger‐scale storm conditions. More integration between
weather and landscape scientists can advance knowledge of how storms inﬂuence landscapes and produce
hazards, especially during extreme events.
1. Introduction
Landscape response from hydrometeorological disturbances can be extreme but is notoriously difﬁcult to
predict (e.g., Hooke, 2015; Lisenby et al., 2018; Phillips, 2006; Schumm, 1979; Wohl, 2013). Understanding
and predicting nonlinear landscape response to forcing events such as severe storms is a long‐standing pro-
blem in geomorphology, which has important implications for hazard assessment. Our ability to predict the
geomorphic effects of severe storms depends on identifying and forecasting the meteorological conditions
that cause them. Whether from landslide initiation, subsequent debris ﬂow mobilization, or eventual

sediment input into ﬂuvial systems, the geomorphic changes associated with extreme precipitation can lead
to signiﬁcant hazards to people and infrastructure and can have lasting effects on landscapes. Historically,
geomorphologists and hazard planners have focused their efforts on identifying the presence of intense
precipitation without in‐depth consideration of its meteorological origins. For example, although many stu-
dies have deﬁned rainfall thresholds for shallow landslides around the world (e.g., Guzzetti et al., 2008;
Postance et al., 2018), they generally do not discuss through what meteorological processes these thresholds
become exceeded. This is partially because detailed meteorological forcing mechanisms have yet to be
directly associated with major landsliding events.
Improved forecasting and early warning of precipitation‐related geomorphic hazards requires examination
of the speciﬁc meteorological processes that lead to extreme rainfall. This can be achieved by linking the
meteorological conditions to the land surface impacts through cross‐disciplinary work. Moody et al. (2013)
suggested that collaborative research between meteorologists and landslide scientists is necessary to advance
the science connecting rainfall to mass movements, and some studies have begun to explore these connec-
tions. For example, Cordeira et al. (2019) showed that 82% of the days in which landslides occurred over a
142‐year period in the San Francisco Bay area of California were associated with landfalling atmospheric
river (AR) storms (e.g., Ralph & Neiman, 2005; Zhu & Newell, 1998). As conduits of signiﬁcant water vapor
to the west coast of the United States, ARs—thousands of kilometers long and hundreds of kilometers wide
—are synoptic‐scale features now recognized as diagnostic for hazard prediction given their relation to high
storm total precipitation (e.g., Ralph et al., 2013). However, landslides and other landscape responses do not
depend solely on storm total precipitation, and notably, many ARs do not cause landslides (e.g., Oakley,
Lancaster, et al., 2018). Rather, rainfall rates (i.e., rainfall intensity) within a storm are well known to be
the determining factor in predicting ﬂash ﬂoods and debris ﬂow initiation (e.g., Caine, 1980;
Cannon, 1988; Guzzetti et al., 2008; Norbiato et al., 2008). Identifying the storm characteristics that bring
high‐intensity precipitation to vulnerable areas is therefore essential to hazard prediction and mitigation.
Such precipitation is typically driven by atmospheric features at a ﬁner scale than that which encompasses
ARs, referred to as the mesoscale. Features of interest at this scale are often a few to hundreds of kilometers
in horizontal extent and last between an hour to a day in duration; examples of mesoscale features include
fronts, thunderstorms, squall lines, and precipitation bands within tropical and extratropical cyclones
(cyclones are rotating areas of low barometric pressure).
Here, we explore the geomorphic effects of one type of mesoscale atmospheric feature known as a narrow
cold frontal rainband (NCFR) that occurs in association with midlatitude (extratropical) cyclones.
Midlatitude cyclones are important contributors to the weather in many regions of the world (including
most of the USA, Canada, Europe, Chile, Australia, and other areas) and produce a variety of precipitation
structures including rainbands. NCFRs are one type of rainband (Hobbs, 1978; Houze et al., 1976) that, if
present, can produce the highest rainfall intensities within an extratropical cyclone (e.g., Hobbs, 1978;
Houze et al., 1976; James & Browning, 1979; Rutledge & Hobbs, 1984). NCFRs are thus of substantial impor-
tance for geomorphologic and landslide hazard studies focused on the effects of rainfall on landscape
response. However, NCFRs have seen only minor attention from these scientiﬁc research communities,
despite their devastating consequences. For example, the January 2018 debris ﬂows that killed 23 persons
in Montecito, California, USA, resulted from an NCFR on a postwildﬁre landscape (Kean et al., 2019;
Oakley, Cannon, et al., 2018).
Using a case study of an NCFR from northern California, USA, that caused hundreds of landslides
(Figure 1) and tens of millions of dollars in infrastructure damage, we discuss general characteristics of
NCFRs and investigate their impacts to demonstrate an emerging link that exists between mesoscale
meteorology and extreme landscape response. To characterize the impacts from this event and document
the spatial and site‐speciﬁc characteristics of landslides caused by the NCFR, we mapped the induced
landslide distribution using satellite imagery and conducted ﬁeld investigations (measuring landslide
geometry and soil inﬁltration parameters, and conducting soil characterization on ﬁeld samples). We then
analyzed the synoptic and mesoscale characteristics of the storm to identify those most important for the
observed landscape response. Our study is motivated by the needs of the hazard planning community to
interface with the atmospheric, hydrologic, and geomorphologic ﬁelds for improved hazard prediction
and to better understand the implications of heterogeneously distributed rainfall on landscape evolution
models. Further, we make the case that NCFRs and other mesoscale features demand more attention by

also globally.
2. Meteorological Concepts and NCFR
To understand the drivers of short‐duration, high‐intensity precipitation processes described herein and that
are of particular interest to geomorphology and landslide hazards, we look to mesoscale meteorology. The
mesoscale encompasses a horizontal scale from 2 to 200 km and a temporal scale of ~1 hr to 1 day
(Thunis & Bornstein, 1996). Although other deﬁnitions exist for the mesoscale (e.g., Lin, 2007, and refer-
ences therein), we adopt a deﬁnition that is both contemporary and relevant to the study at hand.
Atmospheric features and processes often span and interact over multiple scales, but in general, the mesos-
cale distinguishes itself from the synoptic scale in that motions are driven by many different mechanisms
rather than by just one dominant process (Markowski & Richardson, 2010).
NCFRs are one type of mesoscale phenomenon that occur along cold fronts of synoptic‐scale midlatitude
cyclones. As a deﬁning characteristic for midlatitude cyclones, cold fronts (the boundary formed between
colder air and the warmer air that it replaces) commonly bring precipitation in particular locations relative
to the front. An NCFR, if present, will be found coincident with and parallel to the cold front of the cyclone
(Hobbs, 1978). In radar imagery, NCFRs can be recognized as narrow ribbons of high reﬂectivity
(>40–50 dBZ, coinciding with moderate to heavy rain rates; Figure 2). They are generally 3–5 km wide
and may extend up to 100–200 km in length, but are typically on the order of several tens of kilometers long
and broken up into characteristic “gaps and cores” (e.g., Browning, 1986; Hobbs & Biswas, 1979; Jorgensen
et al., 2003; Locatelli et al., 1995). The “cores” are areas of high reﬂectivity and intense rainfall, whereas
“gaps” feature lighter rainfall. Precipitation cores can be a few kilometers to more than 100 km long
(James & Browning, 1979) and are relatively parallel, though generally offset from one another, creating
a zigzag or scalloped appearance. The gaps between cores may extend from less than 20 km to more than
50 km (Locatelli et al., 1995). NCFRs are characterized by relatively shallow (generally <3 km vertically) yet
vigorous convection, producing high‐intensity precipitation (Browning & Harrold, 1970; Marécal
et al., 1993). During an NCFR in Washington, USA, Hobbs and Persson (1982) recorded 2‐min precipitation
rates of 45 mm/hr, and an event in Virginia and Maryland, USA, had recorded 5‐ to 10‐min rates of
100 mm/hr (Koch & Kocin, 1991). NCFR occurrence is widespread in midlatitudes, and these features

have been well observed in ﬁeld campaigns in the western United States (Hobbs & Persson, 1982) and
elsewhere—e.g., the United Kingdom (James & Browning, 1979), France (Roux et al., 1993), Germany
(Gatzen, 2011), and Chile (Viale et al., 2013). Though no climatology exists for NCFR activity along the west
coast of the United States, anecdotal reports from the operational weather forecast community suggest
several events occur each year. Despite the recognition that NCFRs are important meteorological events,
little work has been done relating them to geomorphic hazards.
3. Event Setting
The NCFR storm event examined in detail herein occurred on 22 March 2018 and impacted the Sierra
Nevada foothills in central California, near the town of Groveland (Figure 2). The Groveland area (elevation
870 m) is characterized by steep, rugged terrain and is located at the top of a step in relief (gaining ~600 m in
7 km) where the Sierra Nevada begins to rise to the east, away from the relatively ﬂat Central Valley to the
west (Figure 2). The Tuolumne River cuts through a 700‐m‐deep canyon located 6 km north of Groveland,
and drains a large part of Yosemite National Park, situated to the east. Flows in the river are regulated
upstream by several dams (including one that forms Hetch Hetchy Reservoir—the drinking water source
for the city of San Francisco located 230 km to the west) and downstream by Don Pedro Reservoir, an irriga-
tion source for agriculture in the Central Valley.
The 22 March 2018 NCFR affected terrain in and around Groveland and along the slopes of the
Tuolumne River canyon. The canyon slopes are covered by conifer forest and dense chaparral woodlands
on the south side, and grasses with sparse chaparral vegetation on the north side. The area was affected
by wildﬁre in 2013; however, local burn severity was low on the hillslopes that underwent landsliding in

impacted study area featuring the concentrated landslide distribution (Figure 1). Radar data are shown in dBZ reﬂectivity

2018 (Abney et al., 2019; Staley, 2013). Hillslopes are underlain by mostly metamorphic assemblages of
the Paleozoic Shoo Fly and Calaveras Complexes (Wagner et al., 1991). Exposed rock types consist of
slates and phyllites, and soils are generally either weathered in place or colluvial, consisting of gravelly
low‐plasticity clays and silty sands (additional details available in the supporting information, Text SA).
The metasedimentary rocks in the canyon contain gold‐bearing veins originating in the basement pluto-
nic rocks of the region. These veins were the source of vast lode and subsequent placer gold deposits that
made California famous during the mid‐1800s gold rush (U.S. Geological Survey, 1897). The river corridor
therefore has historical signiﬁcance, with remnants of mining infrastructure and trails located throughout
the bottom of the canyon. Due to the river's scenic, geologic, recreational, and cultural resources, the
Tuolumne River was designated a Wild and Scenic River in 1984. Today, the river hosts a commercial
river‐running industry and serves as a conduit for drinking and irrigation water projects. As such, the
sediment load of the river is a concern for water resource managers (NPS, 2013; Wright & Marineau, 2019).
4. Storm Characterization
4.1. Synoptic Setting
A midlatitude cyclone featuring a strong AR moved across the northeast Paciﬁc Ocean and made landfall in
central California at approximately 18:00 UTC on 20 March 2018. The AR had integrated water vapor trans-
port (IVT; Zhu & Newell, 1998) greater than 700 kg/m/s (where IVT values of 500–750 kg/m/s indicate a
strong AR; Ralph et al., 2019) and remained nearly stationary over the Central Coast for ~48 hr
(Figure 3a). This portion of the storm event produced copious rainfall across much of the state, including
over 100 mm in the study area. Precipitation during this time was predominantly associated with orographic
lifting of moist air by the Sierra Nevada (e.g., Neiman et al., 2013; Ralph et al., 2006) and synoptic‐scale
ascent. By 12:00 UTC 22 March 2018, the AR began to move to the southeast and by the time the NCFR
formed around 18:00 UTC, the core of the AR was situated over southern California (Figure 3b).
However, a secondary but much weaker moisture plume had developed north of the main AR and overhead
of the study area by 18:00 UTC (Figure 4) and the overall synoptic conditions (e.g., divergent upper level air
ﬂow) were favorable for intense precipitation in the Groveland‐Sierra Nevada foothills region (see support-
ing information Text SB, Figures SB1 and SB2).
4.2. Mesoscale Setting
The NCFR feature that produced the high‐intensity rainfall in the Groveland area beginning at 18:00 UTC
on 22 March 2018 was associated with the passage of a cold front. In situ meteorological observations are
sparse in the area of the landslide observations, so we relied primarily on observations from stations located
elsewhere in the Central Valley in conjunction with atmospheric reanalysis products to document the fron-
tal passage (see supporting information Text SB, Figures SB3 and SB4). A surface‐based weather station with
observations at high temporal resolution, located 35 km to the southwest of the study area at New Exchequer
Dam (Figure 2, site NER; NOAA, 2020), indicates the passage of a cold front between 21:00 and 22:00 UTC 22
March 2018 (about 1 hr after impacting the study area). This is demonstrated by an abrupt shift in wind
direction from southeast (~120°) to northwest (~300°), accompanied by a rapid temperature drop and burst
of precipitation (see Text SB, Figure B3). The surface cold front along which this NCFR occurred was likely
modiﬁed and retarded due to its interaction with the complex terrain of California, including the Sierra
Nevada (e.g., Neiman et al., 2004; Schumacher et al., 1996). NCFRs are driven by convergence of low‐level
ﬂow along the cold front resulting in upward vertical motions and shallow but intense convection
(Jorgensen et al., 2003; Locatelli et al., 1995; Persson et al., 2005). Evidence for low‐level convergence during
the 22 March 2018 NCFR is presented in Text SB (Figures SB5 and SB6). Convergence and convection along
the front were the primary processes driving the intense rainfall. This assertion is supported by the orienta-
tion of the NCFR normal to the Sierra Nevada (Figure 2) and extending southwestward over the low terrain
of the Central Valley. In a primarily orographically driven scenario, we would expect intense precipitation to
be oriented parallel to the mountain barrier. While orographic forcing does not appear to be the dominant
process, we cannot rule out that both convergence along the front and orographic processes were simulta-
neously active in producing intense precipitation in the study area.
Radar reﬂectivity imagery indicate that the NCFR formed in the Central Valley by 17:30 UTC and moved
from northwest to southeast along the Sierra Nevada front. The feature itself had a southwest to northeast

orientation as it approached the study area (Figure 2). By 18:00 UTC, the NCFR was over the area of interest
(Groveland and the area immediately north) and persisted there until ~21:00 UTC, when it continued
southeast along the Sierra front. During that time, radar reﬂectivity exceeded 50 dBZ (see radar time slices
in Figure 5), indicative of heavy rainfall and possible hail. The
characteristic sinuous shape of the NCFR and the presence of gaps
and cores are apparent intermittently in radar reﬂectivity during
this time (Figure 2). However, the NCFR stalled over the study area
by ~18:30 UTC, becoming a nearly continuous line of intense
rainfall more than 100 km long. As the NCFR and front stalled, we
infer a shift from shallow to deeper convection, as indicated by
decreasing cloud top temperatures in satellite imagery (see Text SB,
Figure SB7).
4.3. Precipitation Observations
Passage of the AR and the NCFR were recorded at several rain gauges
near the study area (Table 1; Figure 5) and via radar (Text SB, Figures
SB8 and SB9). Storm precipitation began on 21 March 2018 and by
00:00 UTC on 22 March 2018, up to 25 mm accumulation had
occurred. AR‐related rainfall was mostly moderate (15‐min intensi-
ties <10 mm/hr, Figure 5) for the next 18 hr until the NCFR impacted
the Sierra Nevada foothills around 18:00 UTC 22 March 2018. Despite
the moderate rainfall intensities during the lead‐up to NCFR arrival,
the antecedent storm totals were substantial: between 70 and 140 mm
of rainfall were recorded between 00:00 UTC on 21 March 2018 and
18:00 UTC on 22 March 2018 in the region (Figure 5). The precipita-
tion duration and total likely saturated a substantial portion of the
shallow soils (which average only ~0.4 m thick; Text SC) in the
Tuolumne River canyon. Thus, when the more intense rainfall
associated with the NCFR passage arrived after 18:00 UTC, it fell on
already highly susceptible soils with regard to positive pore water
pressure generation. This likely facilitated both slope failure and
overland ﬂow.

Rainfall intensities during the NCFR in the Groveland area were both high and transient. The maximum
15‐min precipitation recorded in the region was 70 mm/hr at GRV41 occurring at 20:00 UTC 22 March
2018. Maximum 1‐hr observations at the E5394 and JERSY stations (located 5 and 48 km southeast of
Groveland, respectively; Figure 2) reached 41 and 28 mm, respectively, as the NCFR moved through the
region between 20:00 UTC 22 March 2018 (E5394) and 00:00 UTC 23 March 2018 (JERSY). During

E5394 and GRV41, respectively (Figure 5). The station closest to the landslides in the Tuolumne River

the event. However, the station came back online after the rainband passed and recorded the highest storm
total (289 mm) of all the stations. Although this total is suspect due to the outage and that it is signiﬁcantly
higher than other observations in the vicinity (Figure 5a), the precipitation total is also plausible given that
the gauge's location is the closest to the most impacted part of the study area. If the gauge observations are
accepted as valid, they provide further support for localization of the impacts.
5. Storm Impacts
The National Weather Service anticipated intense rainfall and impacts associated with this event and recog-
nized the potential for an NCFR to cause debris ﬂows within a postwildﬁre burned area located ~45 km
southeast of the study area (the Detwiler burn area; Meadows et al., 2019). Warnings were issued for intense
thunderstorms and heavy precipitation in the region and government agencies conducted evacuations in
areas expected to receive the largest streamﬂows. Damage from the storm was intense but appears to have
been narrowly focused and generally coincident with the passage of the NCFR. In addition to localized ﬂood-
ing that impacted businesses and washed out roads in the Groveland area, the heavy precipitation also
damaged parts of the city of San Francisco's water delivery system downstream from Hetch Hetchy
Reservoir. This included abnormal seepage from Moccasin Dam, located 7 km west of Groveland
(Figure 2), that resulted in a ﬂash ﬂood warning and evacuations downstream in case the dam failed.
Direct economic losses to infrastructure, including damage to Moccasin Dam, were estimated at $74 million
(Union Democrat, 2018).
Among the areas most intensely impacted from the NCFR was the Tuolumne River canyon, where we identi-
ﬁed a dense concentration of landslides along the canyon slopes. Using high‐resolution satellite imagery
(collected via GeoEye on 17 April 2018) in a three‐dimensional GIS platform (Google Earth), we manually
mappedmore than500 landslides,eachwithadiscreteinitiation point,alonga9‐kmlengthoftherivercanyon
(Figures 1 and 6). Hiking‐ and rafting‐based ﬁeld studies conducted of the area (see Texts SA and SD) revealed
that the landslides were mostly of the shallow (0.2–0.6 m), debris slide‐debris ﬂow type (Varnes, 1978) over-
lying weathered phyllite bedrock and located predominantly on south‐facing grass‐covered slopes on the
north side of the river (Figure 6b). Debris ﬂows entrained substantial sediment along their runout paths,
in total disturbing ~1 km2 of land surface area (Text SD). This represents 4% of available land surface in this
area of the river (as measured from the river to the canyon rim along the length of affected canyon). Although
two additional storms occurred in April 2018 (6–7 April and 16–17 April, prior to collection of the satellite
imagery; see also Hatchett, 2018) that might also have triggered landslides or released sediment to the river
system, comparison of the satellite imagery (Figure 1) to that from oblique aerial photos taken the day after
the NCFR (Figure 6a) reveal little in the way of signiﬁcant changes between these points in time (23 March
2018 and 17 April 2018). Further, both April storms had much lower rainfall intensity compared to the
22 March 2018 NCFR (compare maximum of 13 mm/hr 15‐min intensity at gauge E5394 during the 6–7
April 2018 storm to nearly 50 mm/hr during the NCFR; Figure 5), precluding a likely trigger for landsliding
from the April storms.
The resultant sediment mobilization from the NCFR‐induced landsliding deposited new debris fans and
signiﬁcantly aggraded existing ones at the river's edge (Figures 6c and 6d), modifying the morphology of
some rapids. Sediment budget calculations for the ﬂux of landslide material transported downslope (based
on landslide area mapping and ﬁeld measurements of a 0.4 m mean mobilized sediment depth; Text SC)
indicate that ~360,000 metric tons (t) of material were mobilized to the river as a result of the storm
(350,000 t of hillslope material mobilized by landsliding, and another ~10,000 t by bank erosion opposite a
newly enlarged debris fan; see Text SC). Compared to the average annual sediment load of the river (based
on measurements of suspended‐sediment transport in previous years, and by decadal‐scale sediment inﬁll-
ing of Don Pedro Reservoir downstream; HDR Engineering, Inc, 2012; U.S. Geological Survey, 2019; Wright
& Marineau, 2019), we estimate that the single‐day 22 March 2018 storm mobilized 1.5–16 times more
sediment than this part of the Tuolumne River generally carries annually and up to 39 times more sediment
than in a dry year. These estimates are especially noteworthy given that the hillslope area contributing sedi-
ment from the 22 March 2018 landslides (0.97 km2; Text SD) represents only 0.04% of the watershed area
from which ﬂuvial sediment load in this river reach could be derived (2,560 km2 between large upstream
dams and Don Pedro reservoir located downstream). If averaged over the basin area of 2,560 km2,

mobilizing 350,000 t of hillslope material equates to a sediment yield of 137 t/km2 or a bedrock denudation
rate of 52 mm/kyr (assuming bedrock density of 2,650 kg/m3). These are reasonable long‐term values
expected for a mountainous region experiencing a Mediterranean climate (Molliex et al., 2017). However,
those values indicate a remarkable erosion event given that they were generated not from the entire basin
over a full year but rather from only 0.04% of the basin in one storm. That such a large mobilization of
sediment mass could originate from such a small proportion of the watershed area indicates the capability
of a short‐lived, mesoscale storm feature to alter sedimentary and geomorphic systems to a substantial
degree. The ﬂuvial geomorphic effects of this storm also affected riparian habitat, as debris fans and
cobble bars formed and enlarged; moreover, bank erosion (6,100 m3) opposite one greatly enlarged debris
fan (Figure 6d) caused large trees to fall into the river. In mountain rivers, such changes to river
morphology and bed composition directly control habitat complexity and viability of certain ecosystem
components such as the survival of periphyton, benthic invertebrates, and ﬁsh eggs within the substrate
(e.g., Bellmore & Baxter, 2014; Greig et al., 2005; Hauer et al., 2011; Spina, 2000).
6. Discussion
6.1. Synoptic and Mesoscale Inﬂuences on Landslide Triggering
The well‐recorded rainfall time series of the synoptic (AR) and mesoscale (NCFR) meteorological features
during the March 2018 storm, combined with observations collected during our ﬁeld investigations, allow
us to explore the surface and subsurface hydrological conditions that led to localized landsliding in the

Tuolumne River canyon. For example, by comparing the storm's rainfall intensities to site‐speciﬁc soil
hydraulic conductivity values, we can evaluate the possible mechanisms that could have caused runoff
(e.g., Mirus & Loague, 2013) and landslide initiation (e.g., Collins & Znidarčić, 2004). Measurements
using a minidisk inﬁltrometer (see Text SA) revealed hydraulic conductivities of the soil surface in the
range of 5 to 20 mm/hr—far lower than the rainfall intensities recorded during the peak of the NCFR.
However, the 70–140 mm of antecedent rainfall that occurred during the 32 hr prior to the NCFR event
occurred at much lower intensities (generally less than 10 mm/hr; Figure 5b) and may have led to
near‐complete saturation of the subsurface prior to NCFR arrival. Our measured value of hydraulic
conductivity from the failure plane (2 mm/hr) suggests that ponding would have occurred in the absence
of macroscale bedrock fractures. Thus, the higher rainfall intensities during the peak of the storm may
have then caused pore water pressures to increase at the soil‐bedrock interface, leading to landslide
initiation. However, with measured rainfall intensities also greater than the saturated hydraulic
conductivity of the soil surface, overland‐ﬂow‐inducing erosion (e.g., Godt & Coe, 2007) also likely led to
debris ﬂow generation.
To examine how the progression of rainfall may have impacted soil pore water pressure evolution and
runoff potential, we conducted a 1‐D unsaturated zone hydrology simulation using the USGS program
VS2Dt (e.g., Lappala et al., 1987). VS2Dt is a ﬁnite difference model that solves Richards equation for vari-
ably saturated subsurface water ﬂow with time‐varying boundary conditions. Our model domain consists of
a 40 cm thick sandy loam (Ks = 20 mm/hr) overlying a 10 cm thick silt loam base (Ks = 2 mm/hr), with a
gravity drainage boundary condition at the bottom of the domain. We utilized soil moisture constitutive
relationships of van Genuchten‐Mualem (van Genuchten, 1980) based on our measured soil textures
(Text SA) and used the 15‐min rainfall record from CWOP gauge E5394 (Table 1, Figures 5 and 7) to run
Figure 7. (a) Numerical model results showing the evolution of pressure head over time for a 1‐D soil column subjected
to the rainfall record shown in (b) (see E5394 station in Figures 2 and 5). The modeled soil column is 40 cm thick
sandy loam with a saturated hydraulic conductivity of 20 mm/hr, overlying a 10 cm thick silt loam with a saturated
hydraulic conductivity of 2 mm/hr, consistent with ﬁeld measurements. Wetting of the soil through steady
AR‐related rainfall on 21 and 22 March 2018 ﬁlls the pore space of the soil column, increasing unsaturated hydraulic
conductivity. This allows rapid transmission of water from the NCFR event beginning at ~18:00 UTC on 22 March 2018
(dashed line), which subsequently produces positive pore water pressure throughout the soil column and enables
saturation excess overland ﬂow. Thick black line indicates the evolution of the position of the water table
(i.e., pore water pressure head equal to zero).

the model. The results show the progression of pore water pressure throughout the depth of the soil column
(Figure 7). As the low‐intensity rainfall begins on 21 March 2018 during the AR part of the event, the soil
column gradually sees a reduction in suction (negative pressure head) as the inﬁltration front migrates
downward and volumetric water content increases. This steady inﬁltration reaches the contact with the silt
loam base (i.e., simulating a low‐permeability bedrock interface), producing positive pore water pressure
hours before the arrival of the NCFR part of the precipitation time series. Once the NCFR arrives, the
model indicates that the soil column immediately becomes fully saturated with the perched water table
reaching the ground surface, producing increased pore water pressure at the contact and enabling
saturation‐excess overland ﬂow for the duration of the event. The model results therefore suggest that effec-
tive stress along the failure plane was fully reduced, increasing the likelihood of shallow landsliding.
Additionally, the lack of available water storage in the soil may have shunted off the bulk of the NCFR rain-
fall as runoff, and inﬁltration excess overland ﬂow caused by the high rainfall intensity accompanying the
strongest pulses of the NCFR may also have occurred. This is consistent with our ﬁeld observations for both
discrete shallow landslide events as well as signiﬁcant runoff‐driven erosion and debris ﬂows (Figure 6a).
Therefore, the numerical simulation results show that the preceding AR event likely played an important
role in preconditioning the soil for multiple failure modes upon the onset of the NCFR. However, although
the strong AR was likely critical for reaching antecedent and potentially near‐saturated soil conditions, it
was not the driver of the intense precipitation that likely led to landsliding. Rather, landsliding and debris
ﬂow formation occurred under much weaker precipitable water vapor and moisture transport conditions
during NCFR passage several hours after the AR had moved southward away from the study region
(Figure 3b).
6.2. NCFR Inﬂuence on Landslide Distribution
Our evaluation of the 22 March 2018 Tuolumne River canyon event provides a diagnostic view of the direct
impacts that a mesoscale meteorological feature such as an NCFR can have on geologic hazards and land-
scape response. Typically, regions of localized landsliding can be identiﬁed through analysis of susceptibility
traits—for example, soil type and depth, rock type, vegetation, land use, regional relief, and topographic
slope, convergence, and aspect (e.g., Guzzetti et al., 2005). Our ﬁeld investigation revealed at least some com-
monalities that can be ruled out with respect to identifying why the landsliding occurred in such a narrow
region. That is, some characteristics such as soil type and depth, and bedrock type, do not vary considerably
throughout and in neighboring areas of the canyon. However, topographic aspect and vegetation apparently
played a role in minimizing landslide initiation on the south (more densely vegetated) side of the canyon,
where forest and chaparral likely intercepted precipitation before it was able to inﬁltrate the subsurface,
and vegetation root strength (e.g., McGuire et al., 2016; Schmidt et al., 2001) would have resisted
landslide‐inducing shear stresses. Although wildﬁre had affected the area 5 years earlier (the 2013 Rim
Fire), examination of burn severity and debris ﬂow hazard maps (Abney et al., 2019; Staley, 2013) indicate
low likelihood of increased susceptibility to landsliding in the vicinity of the documented landsliding. The
dominant vegetation type (grasses) within the majority of the area affected by landsliding showed no
changes following the ﬁre (as indicated by historical satellite imagery), suggesting little chance of
vegetation‐type conversion processes that might have aided landslide initiation (e.g., Parise &
Cannon, 2012). Further, other more heavily vegetated areas showed few signs of wildﬁre‐related tree mor-
tality that could have reduced slope stability (Casas et al., 2016; Shive et al., 2017). Thus, we conclude that
postwildﬁre conditions did not likely instigate or exacerbate landsliding within the study region.
Canyon relief and hillslope gradient evidently did play roles in the localized landslide triggering. The land-
sliding appears to have coincided with both a small increase in canyon relief (Figure 8a) and a substantial
increase in hillslope gradient (Figure 8b), with the area of landsliding from the storm nearly coincident with
the maximum gradient of the canyon's side slopes. However, by overprinting the storm's rainfall character-
istics along the same river canyon proﬁle (Figure 8c), the contemporaneous mesoscale rainfall pattern also
clearly aligns with the landslide distribution, thereby explaining its highly localized occurrence. Whereas the
hillslope gradient is somewhat higher just upstream (near river proﬁle at 122 km; Figure 8b), the rainfall
intensity drops off substantially there compared to where the landslides occurred. Further, the area of land-
sliding is overprinted with multiple episodes of maximum rainfall compared to other areas—a result of the
NCFR propagating southeastward along the Sierra Nevada range front and stalling over the study area.

Thus, the mesoscale attributes of the storm, via the development and stalling of the NCFR, support and can
directly explain the extreme landslide response through massive localized landsliding and resultant
sediment transport.
6.3. Broad‐Scale NCFR Occurrence and Landscape Response
Based on observations and anecdotal reports from the operational meteorology community, NCFRs are rela-
tively common in northern California (e.g., Blier, 2003; Blier et al., 2005; Jorgensen et al., 2003; King
et al., 2009; White et al., 2003). Although a catalog of NCFR events has never been compiled (whether caus-
ing signiﬁcant landscape response or not), we can point to another recent and nearby NCFR on 14 February
2019 (Hatchett et al., 2020) as evidence of their occurrence and consequence in the central Sierra region. The
14 February 2019 event also had radar reﬂectivity in excess of 50 dBZ in a narrow band (Figure 9), and tra-
versed through the two counties (Calaveras and Amador) located northwest of Groveland, producing 10‐min
rainfall intensities approaching 60 mm/hr (MesoWest, 2019). As a result, some regional roads were closed
for several days due to landslides and localized ﬂooding, and the severity of damage led to state and federal
disaster declarations. In 2004, another NCFR some 200 km to the west of Groveland near San Francisco also
had extremely high rainfall intensities (5‐min intensities of 128 mm/hr) and caused localized ﬂash ﬂooding
and resultant damages exceeding $27 million (Blier et al., 2005). Similar to the 22 March 2018 NCFR near
Groveland, that NCFR also stalled, suggesting that this may be an important component of a high‐impact
NCFR event. These events demonstrate the presence and importance of NCFRs in the northern and central
California regions. However, a more in‐depth exploration into their frequency and characteristics is needed
to better understand their impacts on both short‐term hazard as well as the long‐term geomorphic evolution
of the region.

Looking more broadly at NCFRs and impacts worldwide, we ﬁnd only a few examples where the landscape
response has been well documented, but these support our view that considering mesoscale effects is
critically important to understanding landscape response and resultant hazards from storm rainfall. For
example, recent work in southern California found that approximately one third of investigated postﬁre
debris ﬂows for which coincident storm radar imagery was available were related to NCFRs (Oakley
et al., 2017), including the fatal 2018 postﬁre debris ﬂows in Montecito, California (Oakley, Cannon,
et al., 2018). Further, Cannon et al. (2018) noted an NCFR in 2017 that produced intense precipitation in
the vicinity of the Santa Ana River watershed in southern California and suggested that NCFRs associated
with atmospheric rivers be further investigated to compare orographic rain rates and NCFR‐driven rain
rates in the region so that the hazards that they produce might be better evaluated. Although NCFRs have
been observed and described from a meteorological standpoint in other midlatitude regions of the world
(e.g., Gatzen, 2011; James & Browning, 1979; Roux et al., 1993; Viale et al., 2013), connections have not been
drawn between these events and landscape impacts. Based on our observations from the 22 March 2018
event and other events described herein, we propose that a relationship is likely; evaluating this relationship
could be a key avenue for future synchronized interdisciplinary research.
6.4. Mesoscale Features and Geomorphic Hazards
We have focused our discussion about mesoscale meteorological relationships with landscape response on
NCFR events speciﬁcally, but the literature contains examples of analogous relationships with other types
of mesoscale meteorological conditions as well. These may also serve as starting points for future geometeor-
ological studies. Whereas intense storm rainfall can cause extreme, landscape‐resetting geomorphic change
and sediment mobilization in a wide variety of settings worldwide (e.g., Casalbore et al., 2011; Hobley
et al., 2012; Le Lay & Saulnier, 2007; Rodríguez‐Blanco et al., 2020), geomorphological investigations of such
occurrences rarely include detailed examination of the meteorological forcing causing such events. The
mesoscale mechanisms resulting in extreme landscape change therefore remain understudied. However,
even without a detailed analysis of the meteorological drivers, the geomorphic response patterns may impli-
cate mesoscale processes as a deﬁning driver of landscape change. A prominent example is a severe storm
that affected mountainous terrain in Ladakh, northern India, in August 2010. There, Hobley et al. (2012)
reported major ﬂooding, landslides, and debris ﬂows that killed 600 people and devastated 60 villages.
Based on the landslide and debris ﬂow distribution, Hobley et al. (2012) concluded that the responsible
storm rainband had been only 6 km wide, but had produced 75 mm of rain in 30 min, 1.5 times the
100‐year precipitation event for that region. Thus, mesoscale meteorological conditions were more than
likely responsible for generating the observed landscape‐resetting geomorphic response.

Hurricanes (also called typhoons or tropical cyclones depending on their location) may serve as another
topical example that could beneﬁt from additional focused studies. Notably, hurricanes are a well‐studied
meteorological phenomenon (e.g., Burpee, 1986) with a direct causal relationship to landsliding (e.g.,
Bessette‐Kirton et al., 2019; Negri et al., 2005). However, most hurricane‐induced landslide investigations
have focused on developing threshold relationships based solely on ground‐based rainfall measurements
without a full understanding of the mesoscale features embedded within them that might deliver copious
rainfall in one place but not another. The reasons for this are well noted—namely, landslide scientists
and hazard planners are generally more focused on predicting the effects, regardless of the exact causal phe-
nomena. However, meteorological studies exist that have attempted to tease out additional understanding.
Analysis of the precipitation patterns during Hurricane Dean in 2007 over the island of Dominica in the
West Indies (Smith et al., 2009) found that stationary cyclonic spiral bands were at least partially responsible
for increased rainfall totals and resultant fatal landslides. Similarly, several debris ﬂows in the southeastern
United States from Hurricane Ivan in 2004 were also linked to the passage of spiral rain bands over the
region (Wooten et al., 2008). Although these studies did not investigate direct causal relationship with the
spatial distribution of all landslides from the events, the data and mesoscale understanding (along with
orographic effects) may provide impetus for future similar investigations. These could then aid predictive
models for expected landslide distributions from hurricanes having similar mesoscale features.
Mesoscale features could also be used to identify the precise meteorological conditions under which debris
ﬂows occur in continental climates (such as those studied by Hobley et al., 2012, in northern India, discussed
previously). Debris ﬂows that resulted from the September 2013 Colorado Front Range storm event, the
number of which was historically unprecedented in that region, provide an excellent example for this
pursuit (Anderson et al., 2015; Coe et al., 2014; Patton et al., 2018). Though orographic lift was a key
process in precipitation generation in that storm, mesoscale circulation features inﬂuenced the spatial
pattern of rainfall such that storm total precipitation maxima were not aligned with the orographic slope
(Gochis et al., 2015). Rather, intense precipitation (with 10‐min rainfall intensities in excess of 60 mm/hr;
Coe et al., 2014) resulted from the merging of two areas of low‐level enhanced convergence and intense
convection over the region most heavily impacted by debris ﬂows (1,138 total over a 3,420 km2 region;
Coe et al., 2014). By comparing debris ﬂow timing to low‐level wind observations and radar reﬂectivity
data from the 2013 Front Range event (Gochis et al., 2015), it is evident that debris ﬂow occurrence was
coincident with mesoscale convective features of the storm. An analogous example of debris ﬂows
generated by mesoscale convection, albeit with a different triggering mechanism (multiday cumulative
storm totals rather than intense precipitation) occurred in southeastern Arizona (Grifﬁths et al., 2009)
where mesoscale convective systems reformed each night for ﬁve days in the same region and led to
cumulative precipitation totals exceeding 50‐year recurrence intervals. These examples all indicate a need
to consider mesoscale meteorological conditions, rather than macro (synoptic) scale or spatially and
temporally averaged storm conditions, to be the likely driver of extreme landscape response and especially
of how and where serious storm‐induced hazards develop on a landscape.
The use of both radar data and mesoscale model output can provide valuable information for geomorphol-
ogists and emergency responders, especially in ungauged and remote locations. For example, this informa-
tion can inform the decision whether to deploy staff to a study site following a rainfall event if precipitation
exceeded thresholds of interest. In addition, forecasts of mesoscale features known to produce high‐intensity
rainfall that are affecting an area of concern may assist in the positioning of emergency response resources.
Although current meteorological forecasting methods are limited in their capability to provide the exact
location, timing, and precipitation intensity associated with mesoscale features (e.g., Schwartz, 2014),
mesoscale models can serve as a useful tool for situational awareness and regional guidance for localized
high‐intensity rainfall that may cause a landscape response (e.g., Cannon et al., 2020). Operational radar
data and radar‐derived precipitation products are also informative, but their utility is limited in this study
area and for areas of complex terrain in general. For the 22 March 2018 storm, radar reﬂectivity was critical
for identifying the NCFR (Figure 2). However, due to factors such as radar beam blockage, beam height and
coverage in the area, and the lack of suitable reﬂectivity‐rainfall (Z‐R) relationship for the particular meteor-
ological situation at hand, quantitative estimates of cumulative rainfall and rainfall intensity were not in
agreement with recorded rain gauge data (see Text SB, Figures SB8 and SB9). These limitations can be over-
come in areas of complex terrain through the installation of gap‐ﬁlling radar networks (e.g., Johnson

et al., 2020) or the deployment of mobile radars to areas of particular concern (e.g., Jorgensen et al., 2011).
Though some progress has been made to improve Z‐R relationships for cool season storms in the western
United States (e.g., Cifelli et al., 2018; Matrosov et al., 2014), efforts to further constrain these
relationships, especially for shallow convective features such as NCFRs, are needed.
7. Conclusions
Meteorological forcing can cause extreme landscape change through delivery of intense and/or long‐dura-
tion rainfall. However, linkages between the particular meteorological features that lead to rainfall enhance-
ment and the resultant landscape change have generally received little attention from the geomorphologic
and landslide hazard communities. Although synoptic‐scale features such as hurricanes and atmospheric
rivers (AR) are well‐known to deliver copious precipitation causing widespread ﬂooding and damage,
mesoscale features such as squall lines and rainbands are also capable of intense precipitation with similar,
but more localized, effects. In this study, we presented a detailed examination of one type of mesoscale fea-
ture: the narrow cold frontal rainband (NCFR). The NCFR event that we selected for analysis led to regional
ﬂash ﬂooding with infrastructure damage in the tens of millions of dollars, caused hundreds of landslides,
and resulted in a localized, 1‐day sediment ﬂux to a major river system that was up to 16 times the average
annual sediment yield for the watershed. The enhanced damage may have been due to the intense precipita-
tion associated with the NCFR occurring after a strong AR had nearly saturated the landscape in the hours
prior to NCFR arrival. We noted several examples of impactful NCFRs in our greater study region (northern
California) that suggest a direct connection between mesoscale‐related intense precipitation and localized
extreme landscape effects and related damage to communities and infrastructure. We therefore argue that
NCFRs are features worthy of recognition and additional investigation. As such, they may be important fea-
tures to consider in the assessment and early warning for geomorphic hazards such as landslides.
Although we focused on the presence and impacts of NCFRs in this study, other mesoscale features (e.g.,
spiral rainbands in hurricanes, mesoscale convection in continental mountain environments) are also
worthy of attention to explain extreme landscape effects that result from storms. To best predict and be pre-
pared for hazards associated with these effects, studies should therefore incorporate the mesoscale atmo-
spheric processes that are capable of producing localized intense precipitation. Whereas many landscape
processes (e.g., landslides, sediment transport) depend on exceeding a threshold forcing, landscape effects
often respond in a nonlinear fashion to linear increases in the driving force (e.g., rainfall intensity causing
saturation or runoff causing shear stress) beyond the process threshold. Understanding and predicting the
spatial distribution of high‐intensity precipitation events associated with various mesoscale meteorological
phenomena should help identify when and where these thresholds may be exceeded. Further integration
between the geomorphology, hydrology, and meteorology communities will advance important scientiﬁc
goals for all, and ultimately improve predictions related to storm characteristics and geohazards.
