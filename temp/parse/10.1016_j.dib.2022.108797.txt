A precise age model of marine sediment core is crucial for 
environmental studies of the past such as paleoceanogra- 
phy, paleoclimatology, and paleo-hazard studies. Here the 
geochemical dataset is described that is used to determine 
the age model of marine sediment cores collected from Ag- 
ulhas Ridge in the South Atlantic Ocean using piston cor- 
ing and multiple-coring systems during the 30th Anniver- 
sary expeditions of R/V Hakuho Maru in 2019–2020 (KH19- 
6 Leg.4 PC10/MC14, water depth of 4,604 m). The top 3.27 
meter of 12.28-meter-long piston core (PC10) and a whole 
0.29-m-long multiple core (MC14) were dated. The dataset 
includes radiocarbon ages of planktonic foraminifera shells 
and oxygen isotopes of both planktonic ( Globigerinoides bul- 
loides, Globorotalia inﬂata ) and benthic ( Gyroidina soldanii ) 
foraminifera shells. The top 7.5 kyr record was lost, the ages

How the data were acquired 
The marine sediment core samples were collected during an expedition of R/V 
Hakuho maru (KH19-6 Leg.4). After getting off the ship, the sediment samples 
were cut into subsamples and fossil foraminifera shells were collected in the 
laboratory. By hand-picking target species’ shells, these were dissolved in 
phosphoric acid and the emitted carbon dioxide were used for both radiocarbon 
and stable oxygen (and carbon) isotopic analysis. Radiocarbon and stable oxygen 
isotopes were measured by using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) and isotope 
ratio mass spectrometry (IR-MS), respectively.

Value of the Data 
• The age model of marine sediment cores is a prerequisite for relevant studies using this 
material. 
• Paleoenvironmental records based on a robust age model will contribute to an accurate 
understanding of environmental changes of the past. 
• These data are useful to those who plan to collect new sediment cores from South Atlantic 
site in the future. 
1. Objective 
An age model of marine sediment core is a prerequisite to start environmental studies of the 
past such as paleoceanography, paleoclimatology, and paleo-hazard studies. It helps to under- 
stand chronological sequence of an event that happened in the past. Also, it reveals sedimenta- 
tion rate of the cores, which helps to determine time intervals to study and how much sediment 
materials need to be collected during sampling to achieve the desired temporal resolution. 
2. Data Description 
All geochemical data obtained are archived in an online repository, which include radiocarbon 
dates of planktonic foraminifera, oxygen and carbon isotopes of both planktonic and benthic 
foraminifera, and coarse fraction of the sediment. 
3. Experimental Design, Materials and Methods 
3.1. Materials 
Marine sediment cores (PC10 and MC14) obtained from the Agulhas Ridge in 14 Jan 2020 by 
R/V Hakuho maru were analyzed. 
PC10: A piston corer consists of a 900 kg-weight, a total 14 m-long stainless steel barrel and 
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) inner pipe, a core bit, a core catcher, a wired piston cylinder inside and 
a trigger arm. The inner diameter of inner pipe is 74 mm. A 100-kg weighed multiple-type corer 
“Asyura” was used as pilot weight. The multiple-type pilot corer consists of a stainless-steel 
frame and three sub-corer attachments containing three 0.6-m long acrylic resin tubes and self- 
closing lids at both ends of each tube, which enables a collection of short sediment cores and 
bottom water without disturbance at the sediment surface. The inner diameter of each acrylic 
resin tube is 80 mm. A 12.28-m-long PC10 was obtained, and the core was split into working- 
and archive-halves using a splitting devise with nylon line. Archive-half sections was provided 
for photographs, color reﬂectance measurements with a reﬂectance photospectrometer and vi- 
sual core description of lithology (clay with foraminifera diatoms). Working-half sections was 
used for a further sampling: The sediment was cut in 1 cm intervals and used for further anal- 
yses. 
MC14: Surface sediment samples were collected with a Barnet-type multiple corer to min- 
imize a sediment disturbance during the corer penetration into sediments. The multiple corer 
equipped eight 60-cm long core tubes with an inner diameter of 82 mm. A 74 mm inner diam- 
eter tube was used. After recovery of the multiple corer onboard, we retrieved sediments with 
overlying seawater and kept chilled either outside the deck or in a cold room. 0.29-meter-long 
MC14 was obtained. A whole MC14 were used for further analyses: The sediment was cut in 1 
cm intervals and used for further analyses.

3.2. Coarse Fraction Analysis of PC10 
In a laboratory at the Center for Advanced Marine Core Research, Kochi University, the weight 
of each subsample was measured after drying. They were gently washed under running water 
over a 63 μm sieve (SIEVE FACTORY IIDA Co., Ltd., Japan) and dried at 60 °C in a convection oven 
(Yamato Scientiﬁc Co., Ltd., Japan). The weights of them were measured, and the weight percent 
of coarse material was calculated. 
3.3. Radiocarbon Analysis of PC10 and MC14 
In a laboratory at Kobe University, the subsamples of PC10 and MC14 were freeze-dried (FDU- 
20 0 0, EYELA, Japan) and gently washed under running water over a 63 μm sieve (SIEVE FACTORY 
IIDA Co., Ltd., Japan) and dried at 60 °C in a convection oven (Yamato Scientiﬁc Co., Ltd., Japan). 
The sieved materials were further divided into size fractions of 63–255, 255–30 0, 30 0–355, 355–
425, > 425 μm, and stored in plastic vials. From 300–355, 355–425, and > 425 μm size fractions, 
∼10 mg of planktonic foraminifera, Globorotalia inﬂata , shells were hand-picked by a ﬁne brash 
under a microscope. Priority were the larger size individuals, as the picking was easier and there 
is no size-dependency of radiocarbon of foraminiferal tests. 
Subsequent radiocarbon analysis was conducted at a laboratory of Atmosphere and Ocean 
Research Institute (AORI), The University of Tokyo. The shells were gently crushed to open all 
chambers between grass slides and transferred into vacuum vials. The samples ultrasonicated 
with Milli-Q water and supernatant with suspended materials was removed. This was repeated 
several times until the supernatant becomes transparent. After vacuuming air in the vial, the 
shells were reacted with phosphoric acid, and the carbon dioxide produced was collected. The 
carbon dioxide was converted to graphite by a Fe catalyst at 620 °C for 6–12 hours. The target 
graphite samples were measured with a single-stage AMS (NEC, USA) installed at AORI. 
As for the sample from 25–26 cm depth of MC14, radiocarbon was measured twice ( ∼10 mg 
each G. inﬂata shells were consumed), and an average of 14 C ages was used. 
Conventional 14 C ages were converted into calendar age before 1950 CE using a Marine20 
calibration curve [6] with a local marine 14 C reservoir age of 2 ± 54 years. 
3.4. Oxygen and Carbon Isotope Analysis of PC10 and MC14 
From the coarse fraction of PC10, ∼20 individuals of planktonic foraminifera ( Globigerinoides 
bulloides and Globorotalia inﬂata ) shells were hand-picked by a ﬁne brash under a microscope. 
Analysis intervals were 1 cm for both G. bulloides and G. inﬂata until ∼50 cm below seaﬂoor, and 
then 8 cm for G. bulloides . and 2–4 cm for G. inﬂata. G. bulloides disappeared deeper than the 
depth of 124 cm. As for G. inﬂata , intervals equivalent to Marine Isotope Stage 6 to 5 transition 
were analyzed in higher resolution. 
From the coarse fraction of MC14, ∼20 individuals of planktonic foraminifera, Globorotalia 
inﬂata , shells were hand-picked by a ﬁne brash under a microscope. Analysis intervals were 1 
cm. 
From the coarse fraction of PC10 and MC14, 3 individuals of benthic foraminifera, Gyroid- 
ina soldanii , shells were hand-picked by a ﬁne brash under a microscope. Analysis intervals de- 
pended on their occurrence. In some samples, they were absent. 
The shells were gently crushed to open all chambers between grass slides and transferred 
into v-shaled vials for oxygen and carbon isotope analyses. Isotopes of planktonic and benthic 
foraminifera were measured using an isotope-ratio mass spectrometer (Isoprime) with an auto- 
mated carbonate reaction system (Multiprep) installed at the Center for Advanced Marine Core 
Research, Kochi University. The values of δ18 O are reported with respect to the Vienna Pee Dee 
Belemnite standard using standard delta notation in permil54. Analytical precision for long-term

measurement of the calcite standard (IAEA603) was better than 0.1 ‰ . A drift correction for the 
sample δ18 O values was performed, as the long-term drift of the measured IAEA603 values of 
the standards during the measurement period between December 2020 and October 2021 was 
observed. 
3.5. Data Screening and Age Model Establishment of PC10 and MC14 
As the 14 C age of 1–2 cm depth of MC14 was out of stratigraphic consistency (older than 
the samples below), it was omitted from calculations of the age-depth model and sedimenta- 
tion rate. The age-depth model for MC14 was calculated by linear regression of 8 radiocarbon 
dates (a sedimentation rate during this span was 1.6 cm/kyr). The age-depth model for PC10 
was calculated for two time intervals; one is 0–9 cm depths and the other is 9–25 cm depths 
(sedimentation rates were 0.9 cm/kyr and 1.2 cm/kyr, respectively). We observed a low sedi- 
mentation span at 9 cm depth below seaﬂoor (from 21.3 to 35.6 kyr BP). Below 25 cm depth, 
235–236 cm and 296–297 cm depths were tied to 125 kyr BP and 136 kyr BP, respectively. They 
correspond to marine isotope stage 5 and 6, respectively. The linear sedimentation rates for the 
intervals 25–236 cm and 236–297 cm were calculated as 2.6 cm/kyr and 5.5 cm/kyr, respectively 
( Figs. 1-6 ).

in at 9 cm depth of PC10 and 22–26 cm depth of MC14, which correspond to the time-period from 21.3 to 35.6 kyr BP.

BP (Marine Isotope Stage 5, MIS 5) and 136 kyr BP (MIS 6), respectively.

A close match of these records supports a robustness of the age model of PC10 Note that the age model of SK200/17 
sediment core is based on a comparison between oxygen isotope variation of G. bulloides with those of planktonic 
foraminifera of global low latitude ocean [4] , as well as with those of benthic foraminifera of global ocean (LR04 [5] ).
