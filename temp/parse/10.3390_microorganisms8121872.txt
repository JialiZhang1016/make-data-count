Abstract: With over 50 million currently conﬁrmed cases worldwide, including more than 1.3 million
deaths, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has a major
impact on the economy and health care system. Currently, limited prophylactic or therapeutic
intervention options are available against SARS-CoV-2. In this study, 400 compounds from the
antimicrobial “pandemic response box” library were screened for inhibiting properties against
SARS-CoV-2. An initial screen on Vero E6 cells identiﬁed ﬁve compounds that inhibited SARS-CoV-2
replication. However, validation of the selected hits in a human lung cell line highlighted that
only a single compound, namely Retro-2.1, eﬃciently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication. Additional
analysis revealed that the antiviral activity of Retro-2.1 occurs at a post-entry stage of the viral
replication cycle. Combined, these data demonstrate that stringent in vitro screening of preselected
compounds in multiple cell lines reﬁnes the rapid identiﬁcation of new potential antiviral candidate
drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2.

1. Introduction
In December 2019, a new zoonotic coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China,
named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is the etiological agent
of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [1–3]. The clinical features of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients
range from mild cold-like symptoms to severe illness ultimately leading to acute respiratory distress
syndrome [2,4]. Patients at an older age and with underlying comorbidities are at higher risk of
developing severe courses of COVID-19 [5]. Despite unprecedented international public health
response measures to contain SARS-CoV-2 transmissions, the viral outbreak is currently categorized
as a pandemic with over 50 million conﬁrmed laboratory cases reported worldwide, including over
1.3 million deaths as of November 2020 [6]. At present, and despite earlier outbreaks of SARS-CoV
and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, there are limited approved antiviral treatment

options, such as antiviral drugs, vaccines and immuno-prophylaxis, that can be used prophylactically
or therapeutically to halt the current SARS-CoV-2 infections.
Vaccine development is a long process to reach approvement for clinical use, and although
SARS-CoV-2 vaccine developments are currently expedited, the eventual worldwide vaccine
distribution may be delayed for additional months [7]. Moreover, while vaccines are used
prophylactically, antiviral drugs can be employed both prophylactically and therapeutically.
For SARS-CoV-2, several antiviral compounds have been evaluated, such as the nucleoside analogue
remdesivir, the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2)inhibitor camostat mesylate, and the
antimalaria drug (hydroxy-) chloroquine, targeting diﬀerent stages of the viral replication cycle [8–10].
All three antiviral drugs have recently been tested in large patient cohorts, whereby remdesivir has been
shown to reduce the hospitalization time, but proved to exert only a marginal beneﬁt for patients with
severe COVID-19 disease [11]. Several clinical trials with either hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine
did not reveal any beneﬁt in the clinical outcome [11–15]. Additionally, RNA viruses, including
coronaviruses, are known to rapidly evade antiviral drug inhibition by developing resistance mutations
and subsequent selection of drug-resistant viral populations [16–18]. Therefore, the use of multiple
drug regimens as well as expanding the repertoire of available antiviral treatment options are of crucial
importance to combat the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
Since the beginning of the 21st century, multiple epidemics have been caused by a viral
or bacterial agent, such as the Ebola-, measles-, Zika-viruses and cholera [19]. Some epidemics
have even reached pandemic proportions, such as the inﬂuenza A/H1N1 virus and the currently
circulating SARS-CoV-2 [20,21]. As a rapid response to these virulent agents, the Medicines for
Malaria Venture and Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiatives developed the pandemic response box
(PRB), a compound library containing 400 compounds with antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral
properties. This compound library allows rapid evaluation of potential drug repurposing against
newly emerging pathogens.
To this end, we performed an in vitro-based screen of 400 preselected compounds with antibacterial,
antifungal, and antiviral properties contained in the PRB and assessed their antiviral activity against
SARS-CoV-2. A stringent large-scale screen in Vero E6 cells highlighted sixteen compounds that
prevented virus-induced cytopathogenic eﬀects (CPE) while displaying low cytotoxicity and no
detrimental eﬀect on cell viability. Further validation using Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells revealed that only
one compound, Retro-2.1, showed substantial SARS-CoV-2 inhibition while the antiviral eﬀects of
the other compounds were only observed in Vero E6 cells. Time-of-addition analysis indicated that
Retro-2.1 targets SARS-CoV-2 at a post-entry stage of the viral replication cycle. Together, these data
demonstrate that stringent in vitro screening of preselected compounds on diﬀerent cell lines reﬁnes
the rapid identiﬁcation of a new potential antiviral candidate drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Cell Lines and Viruses
Vero E6 cells (kindly provided by M. Müller and C. Drosten, Charité, Berlin, Germany)
and Calu-3 cells (HTB-55, American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA, USA)
were propagated in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle Medium–GlutaMAX, 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, 100 IU/mL penicillin, 1% (w/v) non-essential
amino acids and 15 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES, Gibco,
Gaithersburg, MD, USA).
Cells were maintained at 37 ◦C in a humidiﬁed incubator with 5%
CO2. SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2/München-1.1/2020/929 [22]) stocks were produced on Vero E6 cells,
aliquoted and stored at −80 ◦C. Viral titers were determined by tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50)
on Vero E6 cells after 72 h incubation at 37 ◦C in a humidiﬁed incubator with 5% CO2.

2.2. Compound Preparation of the Pandemic Response Box
All 400 compounds (purity of >90%) distributed in 96-well plates were dissolved and diluted
in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and aliquoted at a concentration
of 1 mM in 96-well plates (Techno Plastic Products AG, Trasadingen, Switzerland) and were kept
at −20 ◦C until further use. Compounds were diluted at the indicated concentration in cell culture
medium. The control compound remdesivir (MedChem Express, NJ, USA, HY-104077) was diluted
to a 20 mM working stock in DMSO and stored at −80 ◦C, while K22 was prepared and stored as
described previously [17].
2.3. Antiviral Activity Screening
Vero E6 cells were seeded in 96-well clear bottom, black wall plates (Costar, Tewksbury, MA, USA),
at a density of 20,000 cells per well, one day prior to the experiment. Cells were pretreated for 2 h with
1 µM of each compound contained in the PRB. Remdesivir [8], K22 [17], and vehicle controls (DMSO)
were included in each plate. Subsequently, cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity
of infection (MOI) of 0.01 in compound-containing medium and incubated at 37 ◦C in a humidiﬁed
incubator with 5% CO2. Uninfected (mock) controls were included in each plate. At 48 h post-infection
(hpi), cells were ﬁxed with 4% (v/v) neutral buﬀered formalin (Formaﬁx AG, Hittnau, Switzerland)
and stained with crystal violet. Cell viability and cytotoxicity were assessed in parallel, in identically
treated, uninfected plates. Two independent experiments were performed, each including a technical
duplicate. Wells containing an intact cell layer without apparent CPE after infection and displaying
high cell viability and low cytotoxicity were considered as hits.
2.4. Cell Cytotoxicity and Cell Viability
Cell cytotoxicity and viability were assessed using CellTox™green cytotoxicity assay (Promega,
Dübendorf, Switzerland) and CellTiter-Glo®2.0 assay (Promega), respectively, according to
manufacturer’s protocols. Readout was performed on a Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader
(BioTek, Sursee, Switzerland). The mean raw values were standardized by calculating the z-scores and
individual cell cytotoxicity and viability scores of compounds exceeding a conﬁdence interval of 95%
(z-score of −2 or +2) were regarded as nonviable hits.
2.5. Half Maximal Eﬀective Concentration (EC50) Determination of Selected Compounds
Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells were seeded in 96-well clear bottom, black wall plates (Costar), at a
density of 20,000 or 40,000 cells per well, respectively, one day prior to the experiment. Cells were
pretreated for 2 h with 2-fold serial dilutions of selected compounds, ranging from 4 µM to 0.062 µM.
Cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI of 0.01) in compound-containing medium and incubated at
37 ◦C in a humidiﬁed incubator with 5% CO2. Cells were ﬁxed with 4% (v/v) neutral buﬀered formalin
at 24 and 48 (Vero E6) or 48 (Calu-3) hours post-infection and processed for immunoﬂuorescence
analysis. Brieﬂy, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Merck, Kenilworth, NJ, USA)
for 5 min and blocked in phosphate-buﬀered saline (PBS), supplemented with 50 mM NH4Cl,
0.1% (w/v) saponin (Sigma) and 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Immunoglobulin G (IgG)-free, Jackson
Immunoresearch, Westgrove, PA, USA). SARS-CoV-2 antigen-positive cells were detected using a
rabbit polyclonal anti-SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (Rockland, Limerick, PA, USA 200-401-A50)
and a secondary Alexa Fluor® 488-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) or Alexa Fluor® 647-labeled
donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) (Jackson Immunoresearch). Samples were counterstained using
4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Darmstadt, Germany) to visualize the
nuclei and ﬁnally washed with PBS.
Images were acquired on a Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek) equipped
with a 4× air objective (numerical aperture: 0.13). Four images per well were acquired to cover the
entire surface of the well and processed and stitched using the Gen5 ImagePrime software package
Microorganisms 2020, 8, 1872

(v. 3.08.01). The percentage of virus-infected cells in each well was calculated by dividing the number
of cells with a cytoplasmic green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP) signal (SARS-CoV nucleocapsid) by the
total number of detected cells (DAPI). Nuclei were segmented using a primary mask with dynamic
thresholding and a secondary mask encompassing the cytoplasm was based on the primary mask,
dilated by 5 µm.
The half maximal eﬀective concentration (EC50) was calculated in GraphPad
Prism (San Diego, CA, USA, v. 9.0.0) using the non-linear variable slope with four parameters option,
the corresponding EC90-value was calculated based on the previously calculated EC50-value and the
hill slope values.
2.6. Half-Maximum Cytotoxicity Concentration (CC50) Determination
To determine the cytotoxicity of the compounds and for later calculation of the selectivity index
(SI), a dilution series ranging from 100 µM to 0.19 µM for both Vero E6 cells and Calu-3 cells was
prepared in cell culture medium and incubated for 48 h at 37 ◦C in a humidiﬁed incubator with 5% CO2.
Cytotoxicity and cell viability were both assessed as described earlier, whereby the CC50 was calculated
in GraphPad Prism (v. 9.0.0) using the non-linear variable slope with four parameters option.
2.7. Time-of-Addition Experiment
Vero E6 cells were seeded in 96-well, clear bottom, black wall plates (Costar) at a density of
20,000 cells per well. Retro-2.1 and the vehicle control (DMSO) were diluted in cell culture medium at
a concentration of 10 µM or using an equal volume of DMSO. Cells were (pre-) treated and infected
with a MOI of 0.01. Following each incubation step, cells were washed three times with PBS to
remove any residual compound or virus. At 24 h post-infection, supernatant was collected for viral
titration, while cells were ﬁxed and processed for immunoﬂuorescence analysis as described before
using an Alexa Fluor® 647-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) as a secondary antibody (Jackson
Immunoresearch).
2.8. Data Representation
Graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism software (v. 9.0.0) and the ﬁnal ﬁgures were
assembled in Adobe Illustrator CS6 (v. 16.0.0). Brightness and contrast of microscopy pictures were
minimally adjusted and processed identically to their corresponding control using FIJI (v. 1.53c).
Images were assembled using the FigureJ plugin in FIJI [23].
3. Results
3.1. Survival Screen with Compounds Included in the Pandemic Response Box against SARS-CoV-2
To identify potential antiviral compounds against SARS-CoV-2 replication, 201 antibacterial,
46 antifungal and 153 antiviral molecules included in the PRB were screened using a conservative
concentration of 1 µM. Based on the documented inhibition of coronavirus replication, remdesivir
was included as a positive control [8]. The compound K22 was also included in the analysis since it
has been shown to inhibit a broad range of viruses including coronaviruses, arteriviruses, toroviruses
as well as diﬀerent members of the family Flaviviridae [17,24,25]. Vero E6 cells were pretreated
for 2 h and subsequently infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI of 0.01) for 48 h in drug-containing
medium. Cell survival was scored from 0 (virus-induced cytopathogenic eﬀects; CPE) to 1 (no CPE),
upon evaluation of SARS-CoV-2-induced CPE using crystal violet staining (Figure 1A). The cytotoxicity
and cell viability were assessed on uninfected plates processed in parallel, to exclude detrimental
eﬀects of the compounds on the cells.
This survival screen resulted in a total of seventeen compounds that inhibited SARS-CoV-2-induced
CPE (red). In parallel, cell viability and cell cytotoxicity assays were performed to exclude detrimental
eﬀects of each compound on the cells. The mean raw values were standardized by calculating the
individual cell cytotoxicity and viability z-scores. Compounds exceeding a 95% conﬁdence interval
Microorganisms 2020, 8, 1872
5 of 19
(z-score of −2 or +2) were regarded as nonviable hits. This showed that only a single compound
caused signiﬁcant cytotoxicity (Plate D, G11; z-score 3.12) (Figure 1B). In contrast, 10 compounds
exceeded the cell viability cutoﬀ, including the previously identiﬁed compound in Plate B, D10 (z-score:
−6.498) (Figure 1C). Of note, this compound was also observed as a positive hit in the survival screen,
but due to its impaired cell viability, it was excluded from further analysis. The sixteen remaining hit
compounds are categorized as antifungal (three), antibacterial (six) and antiviral (seven) compounds
(Appendix A), which, similarly to their vehicle control (DMSO) and remdesivir, did not inﬂuence
cell cytotoxicity and cell viability. Interestingly, K22 did not show any inhibitory activity against
SARS-CoV-2 at a concentration of 1 µM. These results highlight the relevance of a conservative and
rapid screening of libraries containing compounds that could potentially inhibit SARS-CoV-2.

Vero-E6 cells at 37 ◦C in a humidiﬁed incubator with 5% CO2. The heatmap shows the position on
the plates where survival was observed with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01, which was
scored from 0 to 1 (0 = cytopathogenic eﬀects (CPE) and 1 = no CPE) (A). Calculated z-scores of
each individual compound for cell cytotoxicity (B) and cell viability (C). A conﬁdence interval of 95%
(z-score of −2 or +2) was used as cutoﬀvalues, which are indicated with gray dashed lines. Each bar
represents an individual compound sorted from high to low z-scores (x-axis). The red bars indicate the
compounds that showed inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 during the survival screen. Results are shown as
mean of two individual experiments performed in two technical replicates.
3.2. Antiviral Eﬃcacy against SARS-CoV-2
To further conﬁrm and evaluate the extent of antiviral activity of the previously highlighted
sixteen compounds, cells were pretreated with the selected compounds at concentrations ranging
Microorganisms 2020, 8, 1872
6 of 19
from 4 µM to 0.062 µM and infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI of 0.01). After 24 of infection, cells were
ﬁxed and processed for immunoﬂuorescence analysis using the anti-SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein
antibody and DAPI (Figure 2).
Figure 2. Assessment of the antiviral eﬃciency by immunoﬂuorescence. To determine the eﬃciency of
inhibition of each speciﬁc compound from the survival screen, a two-fold dilution series ranging from
4 µM to 0.062 µM was prepared following infection with SARS-CoV-2. Vero E6 cells were pretreated
with the compound 2 h prior to infection with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI of 0.01) at 37 ◦C in a humidiﬁed
incubator with 5% CO2. Cells were ﬁxed 24 h post-infection, followed by immunostaining with the
cross-reactive SARS-CoV nucleoprotein antigen (SARS N) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).
Remdesivir was included as a positive control. The images are representative of the results of three
individual experiments. Scale bar: 1000 µm.
The eﬃciency of the selected compounds to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 3A,B), as well as
their individual eﬀects on cell viability (Figure 3C), cytotoxicity (Figure 3D), and viral titer
were assessed (Figure 3E). The EC50 values for each compound were inferred by calculating the
percentage of virus-infected cells. This indicated that ﬁve out of sixteen candidate compounds,
n-nonyldeoxynojirimycin (NN-DNJ), PDNJ0803, chloroquine, Retro-2.1 and URMC-099-C, inhibited
SARS-CoV-2 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3C,D). Moreover, these ﬁve compounds showed
EC50 values ranging from 0.29 µM to 0.63 µM, without increased cytotoxicity or decreased cell
viability (Figure 3A–D). These results were corroborated by the dose-dependent reduction in viral
titer, where Retro-2.1 displayed the strongest reduction (Figure 3E). Processing the samples at 48 h
post-infection rather than 24 h post-infection showed that the inhibitory eﬀect of all compounds is
reduced at a later phase during infection (Figure S1). The remaining eleven compounds showed little
or no inhibition at lower concentrations and were therefore excluded from further analysis (Figure S2).
In parallel to the inhibition eﬃciency, the half-maximum cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) was
determined for each compound at concentrations ranging from 0.04 µM to 100 µM on Vero E6 cells.
This demonstrated that the previously tested compounds were all well tolerated at concentrations up
to 100-fold higher than the one used in the initial screen (1 µM) (Figure 3C,D, Appendix B). In contrast,
only URMC-099-C displayed moderate cell cytotoxicity, resulting in a CC50 of 14.7 µM based on viability
and 24.9 µM based on cytotoxicity, while all other compounds had a CC50 above 100 µM (Figure 3C,D,
Appendix B). The resulting selectivity indexes (SI, the CC50-score divided by the EC50-score) showed
that Retro-2.1 (SI = 239.2) is the most eﬃcient and least cytotoxic inhibitor, followed by chloroquine
(SI = 150.8) and URMC-099-C (SI = 50.7). The positive control remdesivir showed a SI of 73.8, while no
SI values were calculated for NN-DNJ and PBDNJ0803 as the EC50-value could not be determined
Microorganisms 2020, 8, 1872

(Figure 3B, Appendix B). Combined, these results demonstrate the identiﬁcation of ﬁve compounds of
the pandemic response box library that inhibited SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells.
Figure 3. Half maximal eﬀective concentration (EC50) determination of the ﬁve hit compounds
showing inhibition against SARS-CoV-2. Vero E6 cells were pre-treated for 2 h with the indicated
compound concentrations prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection (MOI 0.01) at 37 ◦C in a humidiﬁed incubator
with 5% CO2. Following infection, cells were ﬁxed and processed for immunoﬂuorescence analysis.
To determine the reduction in the percentage of virus-infected cells, the number of cells with a green
ﬂuorescent protein (GFP)-positive cytoplasmic signal (infected cells) was divided by the total number
of cells (DAPI, nuclei). The percentage of virus-infected cells of Retro-2.1 was compared to remdesivir,
DMSO (A) and chloroquine, n-nonyldeoxynojirimycin (NN-DNJ), PBDNJ0803 and URMC-099 (B).
Abbreviations: N.D.: not determined. Results are displayed as means and SD of three independent
experiments. The results of the half-maximum cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) based on viability
(C) or cytotoxicity (D) are shown as means and SD from two individual experiments performed in
two technical replicates. Corresponding supernatants were titrated by tissue culture infectious dose
50 (TCID50) to quantify the log10 reduction in SARS-CoV-2 titer (E). Results are displayed as means and
SD of two independent experiments.
3.3. Inhibition Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Infection on Calu-3 Cells
To exclude potential cell-speciﬁc biases, the previous experiments were additionally performed
using a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line (Calu-3), which recapitulates important biological
aspects of the natural site of infection [26,27]. Interestingly, inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication was
only observed upon treatment with Retro-2.1 (EC50: 0.08 µM) or with remdesivir (EC50: 0.17 µM),
based on the percentage of virus-infected cells (Figure 4A,B). The other four compounds showed
no viral inhibition in Calu-3 cells. Determination of the CC50 showed that most compounds were
well tolerated by the Calu-3 cells with values >100 µM, except for URMC-099-C (CC50 = 15.51 µM)
(Figure 4C). Consistently, the percentage of SARS-CoV-2-infected Calu-3 cells treated with Retro-2.1
(SI: 1250) or remdesivir (SI: 588) correlated with viral titers (Figure 4D). This highlights that from the
Microorganisms 2020, 8, 1872
8 of 19
ﬁve antiviral compounds identiﬁed using Vero E6 cells, only Retro-2.1 showed eﬃcient inhibition of
SARS-CoV-2 replication in both Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells.
Figure 4. Analysis of the antiviral eﬃciency on Calu-3 cells. Calu-3 cells were pre-treated 2 h at the
indicated concentration prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection (MOI 0.02) at 37 ◦C in a humidiﬁed incubator
with 5% CO2. Cells were ﬁxed 48 h post-infection, followed by immunostaining with the cross-reactive
SARS-CoV nucleoprotein antibody (SARS N) and DAPI (A). The images are representative of the results
of three individual experiments (only treatments with 4 µM are shown). Scale bar: 1000 µm. The half
maximum inhibitory concentration (EC50) was determined using the percentage of infected cells and
half maximum cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) was determined using cell viability (B, C). Results are
displayed as means and SD of three individual experiments. Abbreviation: N.D.: not determined.

3.4. Time-of-Addition
To determine which step of the viral replication cycle is aﬀected by Retro-2.1, we performed a
time-of-addition experiment. Conﬂuent Vero E6 cells were either pre-treated with 10 µM of Retro-2.1,
or an equal volume of vehicle control (DMSO), either two hours prior to infection, during infection,
or two hours after infection. Alternatively, Retro-2.1 treatment was performed during both the
pretreatment and virus infection steps (Figure 5A). At 24 h post-infection, the supernatant from
each condition was titrated to determine the infectious viral titer, and the cells were processed for
immunoﬂuorescence analysis as described earlier.
Figure 5. Time-of-addition of Retro-2.1. Time-of-addition was performed by Retro-2.1 treatments pre-,
during and/or post-infection (A). Conﬂuent Vero E6 cells were ﬁxed 24 h post-infection (hpi) followed
by processing for immunostaining with the cross-reactive SARS-CoV nucleoprotein antibody (SARS-N)
and DAPI. The percentage of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells (B) and viral titers in the supernatant (C) were
determined at 24 h post-infection. Graphs show means and SD from three individual experiments,
performed in two technical replicates. (D) Representative images of the indicated conditions. Scale bar:
300 µm.
The most pronounced inhibitory eﬀect was observed when cells were treated with Retro-2.1 after
SARS-CoV-2 infection (condition 3) (Figure 5B,D). In contrast, when cells were treated with Retro-2.1
prior to infection (condition 1), only a marginal reduction was observed. Treatment of cells during
infection (condition 2) showed a more pronounced inhibition, which was comparable to condition 4,
which combines treatment with Retro-2.1 prior and during infection. These results were corroborated
by the viral titers analyzed at 24 h post-infection, demonstrating a >1000-fold reduction in viral titer in
condition 3 (Figure 5C). These data indicate that Retro-2.1 likely interferes with the viral replication
cycle of SARS-CoV-2 during a post-entry step.
4. Discussion
In this study, we have demonstrated that a conservative in vitro screening of 400 compounds from
the PRB using two diﬀerent cell lines reﬁnes the identiﬁcation of eﬀective antiviral candidate drugs
targeting SARS-CoV-2. The ﬁrst stage of the screening using Vero E6 cells led to the identiﬁcation
of ﬁve compounds displaying eﬀective antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. This included the
anti-malaria drug chloroquine and antibacterial Retro-2.1, as well as the antiviral compounds NN-DNJ,
PDNJ0803, and URMC-099-C. These compounds showed a dose-dependent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2

infection. However, validation of these selected hits on the human lung cell line Calu-3 revealed that
only Retro-2.1 eﬃciently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication. Time-of-addition analysis showed that
Retro-2.1 likely impairs SARS-CoV-2 replication during a post-entry step of the viral replication cycle.
Combined, these results demonstrate that robust evaluation of novel antiviral candidate drugs should
be performed in diﬀerent cell lines to exclude potential cell-dependent artefacts. K22, which exerts
a well-documented inhibition of several coronaviruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, was,
to our knowledge, not tested against SARS-CoV-2 [17,24,25]. Here, we show that K22 did not inhibit
SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 cells, further emphasizing the requirements of rigorous screening
conditions and robust controls during drug library screening assays.
In the light of the current pandemic, it has become evident that drug repurposing is a promising
strategy that could rapidly help to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 infections. In our study, we employed a
stringent survival screening approach using a library of 400 preselected compounds at a concentration
of 1 µM. Other recent studies have employed diﬀerent types of libraries and screening conditions,
such as incubation time, cell density and MOI, but alike our study, most employed Vero E6 cells as
an initial screening platform and used remdesivir as a positive control [28,29]. In line with these
studies, we also identiﬁed chloroquine, which is approved for clinical use in the context of malaria
treatment, as a potent antiviral compound against SARS-CoV-2, showing the reproducibility of these
screens. Although the evaluation of chloroquine treatments against SARS-CoV-2 infections in clinical
settings has been rapidly undertaken, it has been demonstrated that its antiviral activity on viral entry
is restricted to Vero E6 cells [26]. Concordantly, in our study, we also observed that the impairment of
SARS-CoV-2 replication by chloroquine was restricted to Vero E6 cells. Additionally, limited inhibition
of SARS-CoV-2 by chloroquine was more recently conﬁrmed by experimental infections of Syrian
golden hamsters and rhesus macaques [30]. Altogether, these results emphasize the importance of the
rigorous testing of antiviral compounds in multiple cell lines to exclude potential cell-based artefacts
prior to initiating clinical trials.
In this study, we identiﬁed Retro-2.1 as a novel potent compound that inhibited SARS-CoV-2
replication in both Vero E6 and the human lung Calu-3 cell lines. Retro-2.1 has been previously
shown to inhibit a broad range of viruses including enteroviruses, ﬁloviruses, herpes simplex
virus, vaccinia virus and polyomaviruses [31–36]. It has been suggested that Retro-2.1 remodels the
intracellular distribution of syntaxins, which consequently alters vesicular retrograde transport between
endosomes and the Golgi apparatus [37,38]. Moreover, convergent data have reported the strong
dependence on cellular endomembranes and cellular traﬃcking pathways for eﬃcient coronavirus
replication. Several syntaxins (stxbp1, stxbp3, stx5a, and stx18) were identiﬁed in close proximity of
the coronavirus replication and transcription complex during infection, some of which were further
suggested to assist viral replication [39]. Consistent with these studies, our time-of-addition analysis
revealed that Retro-2.1 substantially impairs SARS-CoV-2 infection during a post-entry stage of the
viral replication cycle. Further investigations are required to deﬁne the precise molecular targets as
well as the mode of action of Retro-2.1.
In summary, the stringent screening of 400 compounds identiﬁed Retro-2.1 as a potent antiviral
compound against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro in diﬀerent cell lines. This vindicates further eﬃcacy and safety
testing in other biologically relevant pre-clinical in vitro and in vivo models as novel intervention
strategies against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses.
