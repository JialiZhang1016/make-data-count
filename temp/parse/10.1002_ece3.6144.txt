1 | INTRODUCTION
Marine ecosystems can change rapidly in response to both natural 
and anthropogenic changes in the environment. Monitoring changes 
in the abundance and distribution of marine organisms is a chal-
lenging but critical component of conservation efforts and natural 
resource management. Human impacts such as overfishing, coastal 
development, and pollution can rapidly increase stress on ecosys-
tems resulting in an urgent need to develop efficient methods for 
monitoring spatial and temporal dynamics of biodiversity (Beng 
et al., 2016).
Fisheries management has long used ichthyoplankton sur-
veys as a component of monitoring because sampling the early 
life stages of fish reflects the reproductive activities of fish

Abstract
There is urgent need for effective and efficient monitoring of marine fish popula-
tions. Monitoring eggs and larval fish may be more informative than that traditional 
fish surveys since ichthyoplankton surveys reveal the reproductive activities of fish 
populations, which directly impact their population trajectories. Ichthyoplankton 
surveys have turned to molecular methods (DNA barcoding & metabarcoding) for 
identification of eggs and larval fish due to challenges of morphological identifica-
tion. In this study, we examine the effectiveness of using metabarcoding methods on 
mock communities of known fish egg DNA. We constructed six mock communities 
with known ratios of species. In addition, we analyzed two samples from a large field 
collection of fish eggs and compared metabarcoding results with traditional DNA 
barcoding results. We examine the ability of our metabarcoding methods to detect 
species and relative proportion of species identified in each mock community. We 
found that our metabarcoding methods were able to detect species at very low input 
proportions; however, levels of successful detection depended on the markers used 
in amplification, suggesting that the use of multiple markers is desirable. Variability in 
our quantitative results may result from amplification bias as well as interspecific var-
iation in mitochondrial DNA copy number. Our results demonstrate that there remain 
significant challenges to using metabarcoding for estimating proportional species 
composition; however, the results provide important insights into understanding how 
to interpret metabarcoding data. This study will aid in the continuing development 
of efficient molecular methods of biological monitoring for fisheries management.

populations, a sensitive indicator of population growth or decline 
(Alstrom & Moser, 1976; Koslow, Miller, & McGowan, 2015). Early 
life stages of fish including eggs and larvae have the advantage 
of being easily sampled in plankton tows, rather than logistically 
difficult visual observation surveys or invasive methods such as 
trawls and seines (Craig, Fodrie, & Hastings, 2004; Harada et al., 
2015; Thomsen et al., 2012). However, a significant problem with 
plankton analyses is that morphological identification of ichthyo-
plankton is difficult for even well-trained scientists and errant 
identifications are frequent enough to make quantitative conclu-
sions problematic. This problem has been addressed by moving 
from morphological identifications to the application of “DNA 
barcoding” where a small fragment of DNA is amplified from in-
dividual fish eggs by PCR and then sequenced. The resulting 
sequences are compared to existing databases for species identifi-
cation. However, for situations involving the identification of large 
numbers of eggs, the sequencing of individual fish eggs is both 
time-consuming and expensive.
Metabarcoding provides an alternative to traditional barcod-
ing that involves analysis of pooled samples of individuals (poten-
tially belonging to many species) using next-gen sequencing (NGS) 
(Cristescu, 2014). Indeed, metabarcoding has long been applied 
to microbial communities where analysis of single individual cells 
is often impractical (Egge et al., 2013;  Klindworth et al., 2013; 
Gilbert, Jansson, & Knight, 2014; Tringe et al., 2005; Venter et al., 
2004), and this approach is gaining traction for species identifica-
tion in bulk DNA samples for biodiversity studies of larger eukary-
otes (Ficetola, Miaud, Pompanon, & Taberlet, 2008; Kelly, Port, 
Yamahara, & Crowder, 2014; Miya et al., 2015; Thomsen et al., 2012). 
Metabarcoding has the potential to increase speed and efficiency of 
biological monitoring, which may contribute to our understanding of 
many ecological issues including species-level discrimination, com-
munity composition, and early detection of invasive, cryptic, rare, or 
threatened species (Bik et al., 2012; Cristescu, 2014; Ficetola et al., 
2008; Miya et al., 2015).
Relatively few studies have assessed the quantitative accuracy of 
metabarcoding results for diverse DNA samples. For example, it has 
generally been assumed that the proportion of reads obtained for a 
given species is proportional to the contribution of DNA from that 
species within the sample relative to DNA from other taxa (Amend, 
Seifert, & Bruns, 2010; Egge et al., 2013). However, it is well docu-
mented that an intermediate PCR step produces amplification bias 
and can influence the accuracy of metabarcoding results and sub-
sequent biodiversity estimates (Bik et al., 2012). Moreover, target 
genes used for species identification are located on the mitochon-
drial DNA (mtDNA) and the copy number of mtDNA across species 
and even tissue type can impact the accuracy of biomass estimates 
(Hatzenbuhler, Kelly, Martinson, Okum, & Pilgrim, 2017; Schloss, 
Gevers, & Westcott, 2011). Over- or underestimating biodiversity 
from NGS data can have detrimental managerial consequences and 
underscores the need for experimental validation of metabarcoding 
protocols (Amend et al., 2010; Cristescu, 2014).
In the current study, we examine the efficacy of metabarcoding 
protocols on mock communities created with known ratios of input 
fish eggs and on a natural community that was simultaneously an-
alyzed by traditional barcoding. We constructed six mock commu-
nities of at least 100 fish eggs that were previously sequenced and 
identified using DNA barcoding. Additionally, we analyzed two sets 
of 500 unknown fish eggs from a natural collection to compare to a 
large sample (n = 1,000) of individually identified eggs from the same 
natural collection. We used the Illumina MiSeq platform to perform 
metabarcoding with sequences of cytochrome oxidase subunit I 
(COI), and mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA both separately and in 
combination to examine the extent to which next-gen sequencing 
results can (a) detect presence of species in mixed samples and (b) 
identify the relative proportions of species in a community. These 
data are critical for understanding how to interpret and draw con-
clusions from metabarcoding data used in biological monitoring and 
fisheries management.
2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 | Sampling locations and techniques
Weekly plankton samples were collected from two sites. (a) Plankton 
samples were collected from the end of Scripps Pier (32.8328°N, 
−117.2713°W) from August 2014 to August 2017. Samples were col-
lected by lowering a 505-micron mesh one-meter-diameter plankton 
net until the net reached the seafloor around midday each sampling 
day. This was repeated three more times for a total of four pulls, 
sampling a total of approximately 16 cubic meters of water (based 
on average water depth of about 5 m). (b) Weekly plankton samples 
were collected from kelp forest habitat adjacent to the Matlahuayl 
Marine Reserve (32.85408°N, 117.28105°W) from February 2017 
to August 2017. These latter samples were collected by pulling a 
333-micron mesh one half-meter-diameter plankton net behind a 
small boat at 0.5 knots for 5 min. The net was weighted for a sam-
pling depth of about 1 m, sampling approximately 60 cubic meters 
of water. The collected plankton samples from both sites were 
manually sorted using a dissecting microscope, and fish eggs were 
individually counted and removed. The Northern Anchovy (Engraulis 
mordax) and Pacific sardine eggs (Sardinops sagax), both morphologi-
cally distinct, were counted and removed from the sample. The re-
maining eggs were stored in 95% ethanol at 4°C for at least 12 hr 
prior to further processing.
2.2 | Identification of individual fish eggs
Individual fish eggs were rinsed with molecular-grade water and placed 
in 15 μl of buffer (2/3 Qiagen AE buffer, 1/3 molecular-grade water). 
Eggs were then physically squished with a clean pipette tip to release 
the DNA. No further DNA extraction or purification was necessary.

DUKE and BURTON
Samples were stored at −20°C prior to polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR). To amplify DNA, we used universal fish cytochrome c oxidase 
subunit I (COI) primers (Ward, Zemlak, Innes, Last, & Hebert, 2005): COI 
VF1 forward primer (5′-TTCTCAACCAACCACAAAGACATTGG-3′) 
and COI VR1 reverse (5′-TAGACTTCTGGGTGGCCAAAGAATCA-3′). 
These markers were selected to take advantage of the near-complete 
COI and 16S barcoding databases (in NCBI's GenBank) available for 
California marine fish produced in large part by the Burton labora-
tory in collaboration with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography's 
Marine Vertebrate Collection. Sequences for each fish species were 
obtained with these primers in our laboratory, so we have some 
confidence that amplification of the target genes will be success-
ful in the local species. The COI primers produced an amplicon of 
710 bp. PCR was performed using 25 μl reaction volume, with 12.5 μl 
of GoTaq Green Master Mix (Promega), 5 pmol of each primer, and 
1 μl of DNA extract (Hajibabaei et al., 2005). Thermal cycling was initi-
ated at 95°C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 50°C 
for 45 s, and 72°C for 1 min, followed by 72°C for 5 min. After PCR, 
samples were run on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized with GelRed 
(Biotium) or SybrSafe (Invitrogen) to detect presence of amplified 
DNA. When samples failed to amplify with COI, amplification of the 
mitochondrial 16S ribosomal rRNA gene was attempted using forward 
primer 16Sar (5′-CGCCTGTTATCAAAAACAT-3′) and reverse primer 
16Sbr (5′-CCGGTCTGAACTCAGATCACGT-3′) for a 570 bp amplicon 
(Palumbi, 1996). COI or 16S products were purified using Sephadex 
G-50 Fine spin columns and sequenced using Sanger sequencing 
(commercial sequencing service). We note that a shorter amplicon of 
the 12S gene is a frequent target for metabarcoding and eDNA stud-
ies, but many of the species found in our study region do not have pub-
lished sequences in the NCBI database for the 12S marker. In addition, 
the 12S gene does not provide the same level of taxonomic resolu-
tion as COI or 16S. Amplified sequences were identified using BLAST 
searches of NCBI database, which contains DNA barcodes from over 
600 species of California marine fishes most of which are vouchered in 
the Scripps Institution of Oceanography Marine Vertebrate Collection, 
allowing for nearly complete coverage of species in California ma-
rine waters (Hastings & Burton, 2008). The top BLAST hit with 97% 
sequence similarity or greater was used for species identification 
(Hatzenbuhler et al., 2017; Miya et al., 2015). Given that we have ex-
tensive data on fish eggs in the study area, the 97% criterion can be 
used to distinguish essentially all eggs for which we obtain 150 bp of 
clean sequence (Duke, Harada, & Burton, 2018; Harada et al., 2015). 
This level of stringency allows for the range of Taq polymerase error 
and Illumina sequencing error intrinsic to our methodology.
2.3 | Mock community construction
Six mock communities were constructed by combining the extracts 
of individual fish eggs (i.e., the remainder of the squished fish egg 
and Qiagen AE buffer) that had been previously identified. Each 
sample consisted of at least 100 eggs representing between 4 and 
17 species in either equal or skewed proportions (Table 1). After 
the desired combination of eggs had been combined into a single 
2-ml tube, each mock community was homogenized using a Mini-
Beadbeater with 0.5  mm beads (BioSpec products) and vortexed. 
Half of the mixture was then extracted using the Qiagen DNeasy 
Blood and Tissue Kit and the other half saved and stored at −20°C. 
Mock communities were amplified using three primer combinations: 
(a) universal fish cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) primers, (b) 
mitochondrial 16S ribosomal rRNA gene (16S), and (c) multiplexed 
both COI and 16S primers in a single reaction. Again, these mark-
ers were chosen to take advantage of the near-complete barcode 
database for California marine fish using these genes. Mock com-
munities were amplified using the following PCR protocol: PCR was 
performed using 25 μl reaction volume, with 12.5 μl of GoTaq Green 
Master Mix, 5 pmol of each primer, and 1 μl of DNA extract. When 
the PCR was multiplexed (simultaneous use of the two primer pairs), 
the final concentration of each primer was 5 pmol and 2.5 pmol for 
COI and 16S, respectively. GoTaq was selected because we high a 
high success rate identifying individual eggs using this master mix; 
although it lacks 3′→5′ exonuclease activity (i.e., proofreading), the 
relatively rare (10–5) error rate is unlikely to cause any problems 
given our species identification criterion of 97% identity. Thermal 
cycling was initiated at 95°C for 2 min followed by 25 or 30 cycles of 
95°C for 30 s, 50°C for 45 s, and 72°C for 1 min, followed by 72°C 
for 5 min. After PCR, samples were run on a 1.5% agarose gel and 
visualized with GelRed or SybrSafe to detect presence of amplified 
DNA. We used 25 amplification cycles in some of our PCRs in an 
effort to reduce amplification bias (Pawluczyk et al., 2015; Schloss 
et al., 2011).
In addition to the mock communities, we analyzed one large 
natural plankton sample form the kelp forest that contained ap-
proximately 4,500 fish eggs. From this large collection, two random 
samples of 500 eggs were processed separately using the metabar-
coding protocol described above for the mock communities. Another 
subset of 1,000 fish eggs from the same collection was individually 
Sanger sequenced using methods described above (i.e., traditional 
barcoding).
Each mock community (6) and natural community (2) was ampli-
fied in four replicate PCRs with COI and 16S primer pairs separately 
(8 communities × 2 primer sets × 4 replicates = 64 libraries). Then, 
each of the six mock communities was again amplified in four re-
actions and replicate reactions were pooled before sequencing to 
compare the effects of pooling samples after amplification and be-
fore sequencing (6 mock communities × 2 primer sets = 12 libraries). 
Additionally, mock communities one through four were amplified in 
four replicate reactions with COI and 16S primer pairs in the same 
reaction to compare the effects of multiplexing primer pairs to sin-
gle primer pair reactions (4 mock communities  ×  1 primer combi-
nation × 4 replicates = 16 libraries). Mock communities five and six 
were not included multiplexed with 16S and COI due to limitations 
on space in our sequencing run.
After amplification, PCR products were cleaned using Sephadex 
G-50 Fine and quantified using Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (ds HS Assay, 
Life Technologies). Samples were diluted to 0.02 ng/µl. A total of 92

libraries were then prepared using the Nextera XT Illumina proto-
col (Table S1). Dual-indexed libraries were sequenced using Illumina 
MiSeq paired-end sequencing with 2 × 300 cycles. The Nextera XT 
protocol fragments amplicons and may create potential bias by ob-
taining more than one tagged fragment from a given PCR amplicon. 
However, since the expected amplicon from each species is the same 
length, the probability of sequencing multiple fragments from a sin-
gle amplicon is equal across species and should not lead to any sys-
tematic bias. We report data collected from all 92 libraries that were 
constructed and sequenced.
2.4 | Data preprocessing and taxonomic assignment
Overall quality of MiSeq reads was evaluated in FastQC. The 
Nextera transposase sequences were trimmed from the target re-
gion. Low-quality tails and Nextera adaptors were trimmed from the 
sequencing reads in CLC Genomics Workbench (Qiagen) with qual-
ity limit 0.01. Only reads with at least 100 retained base pairs were 
used in the analysis (details of the algorithm and its implementation 
are available in the CLC Genomics Workbench user manual). Broken 
pairs (paired-end reads that were unmerged) and orphan reads were 
discarded. For each library, species were identified by mapping the 
reads to a reference library constructed from over 1,000 fish se-
quences of COI and 16S sequences (Supporting information). Two 
species (Seriphus politus and Etrumeus acuminatus) included in our 
constructed libraries did not have 16S rRNA sequences in NCBI. We 
obtained tissue samples from voucher specimens for these species 
from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography Marine Vertebrate 
Collection, extracted and sequenced their DNA and submitted 
these sequences to GenBank (accession numbers: MH714866 and 
MH718435). The total number of reads per species was mapped and 
counted using RNA-seq analysis tools in CLC at 97% similarity to a 
local reference database. While this method may result in some loss 
of taxonomic signal via fragmentation of amplicons, we accounted 
for this by only counting reads that mapped uniquely to one species.
2.5 | Data analysis
All data analyses and statistics were conducted in R. Total reads 
that mapped to a given species were counted and divided by the 
total number of reads mapped for the library to find the proportion 
of that species in the library. For samples where COI and 16S were 
multiplexed, the total species proportion was calculated based on 
the number of reads for each primer in a library to allow for separate

analysis of both primer sets in multiplexed samples. The average 
number of missed species per library for each primer set was deter-
mined, and differences across primer sets and input species were 
assessed by two-way ANOVA. We modeled detection of low-fre-
quency species (<~10% of a mock community) using a logistic regres-
sion with primer set and species as categorical variables. Differences 
between observed and expected proportional read counts for each 
primer set were assessed by ANCOVA with expected proportions as 
a covariate, and primers as a categorical variable.
3 | RESULTS
The total number of reads generated was 15,197,856, and the 
average length of each read was 300 bp. After filtering and trim-
ming, 1,297,257 were retained. Filtering reads after trimming of the 
Illumina transposase resulted in the greatest loss of mappable reads. 
Reads in both directions were mapped to the reference library. The 
average number of reads for each library was 13,853 ± 670 SEM, 
with a minimum of 2,357 and maximum of 32,543 (Figure S1).
3.1 | Detection in mock communities
Overall, 60% of all libraries were able to detect all of the species that 
were input into mock communities (48/80). Forty percent (12/30) and 
sixty-six percent (20/30) of all libraries amplified with COI primers or 
16S primers were able to detect all the input species, respectively. 
These two primer sets were significantly different in their ability to 
detect all input species (χ2 = 3.28, df = 1, p < .05). Seventy-six percent 
of libraries that were multiplexed were able to detect all species; this 
was not significantly different from COI and 16S primer set's detection 
rate, though overall power is low (χ2 = 1.36, df = 2, p > .05). Libraries 
that included more species were less likely to detect all of the spe-
cies present (F = 163.50, 63.75, 37.94, df = 4,2,6, p < .01; Figure 1). 
However, the number of missed species depended on the primer set 
that was used in amplification with a significant interaction between 
primer set and the number of species in a mock community.
Of the 23 different species included in the mock communities, 
5 species were not consistently detected by COI primers: Etrumeus 
acuminatus, Genyonemus lineatus, Pleuronichthys verticalis, Roncador 
stearnsii, and Sardinops sagax. All of these species comprised <6% 
of the mock communities in which they were placed, with the ex-
ception of Sardinops sagax. With COI primers, Sardinops sagax was 
missed in three out of four libraries where it comprised 20% of the 
eggs. By comparison, the same mock communities amplified by 16S 
primers detected Sardinops sagax 100% of the time. This species in 
particular is known to not amplify well with COI primers (A. Harada, 
D. Kacev, pers comm) but can be easily identified morphologically 
(Harada et al., 2015). With the exception of Sardinops sagax amplified 
with COI primers, every species that was in a mock community at a 
frequency of 6% or greater was detected 100% of the time (Figure 2). 
Species that comprised <10% of mock community were detected 
at varying frequency depending on the species and the primer set 
that was used in amplification (χ2 = 259.66, 11.78, df = 2, 20, p < .01; 
Figure S2). Of all the species included in the mock communities, only 
Genyonemus lineatus was missed by libraries amplified with all three 
primer combinations (COI, 16S, or multiplexed). This species was not 
detected in two of the mock communities (3,6) where it comprised 
2%, and 3% of the eggs, respectively. It is remarkable that many 
species that were in mock communities at frequencies as low as 1% 
were reliably detected by both COI and 16S primer sets (Figure S2).
We detected low levels of false positives in our samples which 
were species that were not included in our mock community but found 
in the sequenced libraries. Ninety-two percent of false positives that 
were detected comprised <1% of the total reads in the library (Figure 
S3). The median observed proportion of a species with a false posi-
tive was very low (0.04% of the reads). These reads were identified 
as thirty-eight species, some of which were apparently low levels of 
cross-contamination between libraries or mapping errors. It is also pos-
sible that some contamination is due to eDNA stuck on the fish egg 
surfaces (Fritts et al., 2019 and see discussion below; Table S1).
3.2 | Relative proportions
Across all libraries, we found a positive relationship between the 
expected and observed proportions of reads for each species in a 
library, (R2 = .66) calculated around a 1:1 line (Figure 3). The abso-
lute value of the differences between the observed and expected 
proportions ranged from 0.38 to 0. In the most extreme case, E. mor-
dax comprised 5% of the eggs in mock community five (MC5) but 
accounted for 43% of the total reads in that library. Conversely, in 
some cases we found a <0.01% difference in proportion between 
the observed read count and expected number of reads based on 
number of eggs. While this is a large range of error, 74% of the dif-
ferences between observed and expected proportions fell within 0 
and 0.10 (Figure S4). The average and median difference in propor-
tion were 0.084 and 0.053, respectively. Moreover, the relation-
ship between the expected proportion and the difference between 
observed and expected differed depending on the primer set that 
was used, though the strength of that relationship is weak (Figure 4; 
F = 14.70, 0.076, 5.75, p < .01). There was a significant interaction 
between expected proportion and primers used. We observed that 
samples that were multiplexed or independently amplified with each 
primer set gave similar final estimates for each species (Figure 5; MC 
1–4). We also observed that pooling samples before sequencing or 
combining replicate libraries after sequencing yielded extremely 
similar final estimates of proportional abundance for each species 
(Figure 6).

our standard Sanger sequencing approach to determine species 
present and their relative abundance in the sample (Table 2). Two

coding protocol. Unlike the mock communities with known com-
position, here the standard for comparison is the set of Sanger 
sequenced eggs from the same sample. From Sanger sequencing

than 17 species and the other eight libraries amplified with COI 
primers contained <17 species. Figure 7 shows the species and 
the relative proportion they were found in the libraries for both 
primer sets used (eight libraries for each primer). Both COI and 16S 
primers found all species that comprised over three percent of the 
subset eggs that we Sager sequenced. Species below 3% were ei-
ther detected by one primer set or neither (Table 2). It is important 
to note that the absence of some low-abundance species from the

(we expect some of the rarer species to be missing in a given popu-

4 | DISCUSSION
Our overall objective was to evaluate the efficacy of metabarcod-
ing protocols on ichthyoplankton to determine species presence 
and relative abundance using mock communities of fish eggs. These 
communities were constructed using both even and skewed species 
abundances. We also used a natural collection to compare results 
from metabarcoding and traditional DNA barcoding methods. Our 
results demonstrate that metabarcoding protocols were able to (a) 
detect all high-abundance species and many of the low-abundance

species placed mock communities, and (b) determine high-abundance 
species and low-abundance species with both even and skewed spe-
cies abundances.
4.1 | Detection
In general, species that comprised over six percent of a mock com-
munity were reliably detected in our metabarcoding results. Species 
that comprised <6% of a mock community were detected with varying 
frequency depending on the primers used and its relative proportion in 
the mock community. As the number of species per library increased, 
the ability to detect all species decreased. Furthermore, for both for 
COI and 16S libraries, the highest variability in number of species de-
tected occurs in libraries with the most species (Figure 1), which is 
likely due to stochastic effects of PCR as well as decreasing the rela-
tive proportion of each species (Deagle, Jarman, Coissac, Pompanon, 
& Taberlet, 2014; Pawluczyk et al., 2015). These results imply that as 
the number of species in a sample increases, there would be an in-
creased likelihood that sequencing may miss a given species.
Detection of low-abundance species varied with the primer set that 
was used in amplification. This variation is likely the result of differences 
in the binding efficiencies of primer pairs across template differences 
for certain species (Clarke, Soubrier, Weyrich, & Cooper, 2014; Deagle 
et al., 2014), given primer pairs may not work well with certain spe-
cies and therefore decrease ability to detect that species in a library. 
For example, although Sardinops sagax eggs comprised 20% of a mock 
community, it was not detected in our libraries constructed with COI 
primers. This is consistent with other observations that these primers 
do not work well with this particular species (in fact, S. sagax eggs are

morphologically distinct so they have been omitted from some molecu-
lar identification studies (e.g., Harada et al., 2015)). Similarly, others have 
found that “universal” primers did not amplify groups of taxa so specific 
primers had to be designed to detect these species in eDNA studies 
(Kelly et al., 2014; Miya et al., 2015). Because the degree of amplifica-
tion bias depends on the mix of species in the constructed mock com-
munity, we cannot generalize how this bias affects species detection 
thresholds. Full mitochondrial genome sequences for these fish species 
would be necessary in order to evaluate the effects of primer-template 
mismatches on amplification bias in the constructed libraries. Currently, 
there are relatively few full mitochondrial genome sequences for fish 
species published in available databases; however, as they become 
available, future studies could tease apart the effects of amplification 
bias from other variables that may impact detection thresholds.
We found generalized differences between primer pairs and their 
ability to detect all species in a mock community, with 16S detecting 
proportionally more species than COI in our study. Similarly, Evans 
et al. (2016) found that only two of six primer sets used in an ex-
perimental eDNA study were able to recover the complete species 
assemblages. These results highlight the importance of using multi-
ple primer pairs to improve estimates of species presence in a given 
sample. Recent publications have used 12S ribosomal markers for 
identification, but due to lack of barcode database in our region, we 
were unable to use this marker (Evans et al., 2016; Miya et al., 2015). 
Currently, there is an effort to develop a barcode database for this 
marker by NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center and it could 
be included along with COI and 16S in future studies (D. Kacev pers. 
comm). Our results suggest that in moderately diverse species assem-
blages, rare species can be detected using a combination of markers. 
For example, we have found a maximum number of 19 species in a 
single collection and total number of 49 species observed from se-
quencing over 25,000 eggs collected from the Scripps Pier weekly 
over a period of 6 years (Duke et al., 2018; Harada et al., 2015). In 
contrast, Ahern et al. (2018) identified over 150 species (and up to 
38 species in a single collection) from the subtropical southeastern 
Gulf of California. The efficacy of metabarcoding in such diverse fish 
communities remains to be explored.
4.2 | Relative proportion
There was a positive relationship between the proportions of reads 
obtained from a given species and the proportion of eggs that was 
combined in the mock community, though there was reasonable 
amount of variability (R2  =  .66). These results are consistent with 
other metabarcoding studies that have found a positive relationship 
between species abundance and species read abundance (Evans 
et al., 2016; Thomsen et al., 2012). While most of the differences 
between observed and expected proportions fell between 0 and 0.1, 
in some cases it was as high as 0.38 (Figure S4). This large variability 
could result from PCR amplification bias or interspecific differences 
in the amount of mtDNA per egg (see below). Overrepresentation 
or underrepresentation based on the primers may result from dif-
ferences in primer binding efficiencies across species (Deagle et al., 
2014). For example, some species were detected at very low propor-
tions (<0.01), while other remained undetected at the same input 
proportion. A similar study found that species could be detected at 
biomass percentages as low as 0.02%, but detection limits varied 
among species and could vary considerably from expected biomass 
ratios (Evans et al., 2016; Hatzenbuhler et al., 2017).
When a low-abundance species is undetected or underrep-
resented (i.e., failed amplification), this will result in proportional 
overrepresentation of other taxa in the sample (Deagle et al., 2014). 
There were species that were consistently overrepresented in our 
samples across primer sets and across mock communities. For exam-
ple, the northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) in MC1, MC2, and MC5

is overrepresented across all primer sets used (Figure 5). This implies 
that in addition to primer binding efficacies, there may be inherent 
species-specific differences driving this pattern. This could arise 
from differences in mitochondrial copy number or DNA extraction 
efficiencies across species (Schloss et al., 2011). Although we did not 
measure egg size or developmental stage of fish eggs, a similar study 
that measured biomass of larval fish of similar developmental stages 
found that metabarcoding results were skewed from expected bio-
mass percentages (Hatzenbuhler et al., 2017). Mitochondrial density 
and mtDNA copy number in larval fishes are not well understood 
and may affect detection and proportional species estimates in di-
verse samples. Our results highlight the need for additional research 
on the effects of mitochondrial variation among fish embryos and its 
influence on biodiversity estimates for metabarcoding data.
Quite interestingly, our results showed that regardless if primer 
pairs were used independently or multiplexed, estimates from each 
amplicon (COI or 16S) were consistent across species (Figure 5; MC 
1–4). Either multiplexing or amplifying primers in separate reactions 
yielded similar final estimates of species proportions. Similarly, our 
comparisons between replicates that were pooled before sequencing 
or after sequencing showed that both methods resulted in very simi-
lar estimates of species proportion though notably also suffered from 
similar amplification biases.
We detected low levels of false positives in our samples, which are 
likely due to mapping error, cross-contamination in the laboratory, or 
potentially eDNA stuck on the fish egg surfaces (Fritts et al., 2019). 
Mapping error was particularly easy to identify, because some se-
quences mapped to species that were not included in any of the con-
structed libraries. These were species that we have not previously seen 
in our laboratory but are related to species we have found at Scripps 
Pier (Duke et al., 2018). For example, several 16S reads were attributed 
to Seriola rivoliana (Table S1), a species we have not observed in our 
6 years of sampling. However, we have found Seriola lalandi within the 
same genus and a comparison of 16S rRNA sequences on GenBank 
shows that the species divergence is approximately 3%, right at our 
mapping cutoff. There were also species that we have seen in our 
laboratory that likely resulted from low-level cross-contamination of 
samples during PCR cleanup or library prep. These observations sug-
gest that the move to next-gen sequencing requires additional care be 
given to laboratory procedures needed to prevent low levels of post-
PCR cross-contamination that generally have little impact on Sanger 
sequencing results. Notably, most false positives comprised a very 
small proportion of the overall library and could be eliminated by re-
moving reads that fall below some threshold proportion of the total 
library. Additionally, future studies should include negative controls, 
which are often uncommon in metabarcoding studies, but could help 
reveal sources of laboratory contamination. Our mock communities 
present a kind of negative control in that the eggs in each library were 
known entities based on standard barcoding; for example, MC1 and 
MC4 were “negative controls” for all species other than 4 included in 
each mix. However, true negative controls in addition to mock com-
munities may help to understand rates of false positives in future se-
quencing analyses.
Considering the broad range of factors that could reduce the 
accuracy of metabarcoding, we found our results rather promising. 
First, we note that are many different ways to prepare samples (we 
used bead beating and Qiagen's DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit), am-
plify target genes (we used a nonproofreading GoTaq), prepare se-
quencing libraries (we used Illumina's Nextera XT kit); we did not 
systematically explore other options in this study. Although GoTaq 
does not have 3′→5′ exonuclease activity (“proofreading”), PCR 
error is not likely to be a confounding issue when sequence match-
ing for species identification is only at 97% stringency; in fact, PCR 
error with Taq is likely one or more orders of magnitude lower than 
Illumina sequencing error (see Pfeiffer et al., 2018). Second, varia-
tion in cell number, mitochondrial density, and mtDNA copy number 
among developmental stages within species and between species 
could lead to biases; these issues will likely have greatest impacts 
when few eggs are pooled into a single sample. Third, PCR amplifica-
tion biases add to inaccuracies in analyses of mixed-species samples 
(Clarke et al., 2014; Polz & Cavanaugh, 1998). Rare species may go 
undetected using universal primers, but when desired, they may be 
recovered using species or group-specific primers (though this may 
interfere with relative proportion estimates). Despite these issues, 
we show that our techniques use can give information on both abun-
dant and less abundant species; however, obtaining absolute species 
proportions as estimates of community composition from metabar-
coding remains challenging. If metabarcoding is to be employed for 
monitoring and management purposes, continued ground-truthing 
using multiple markers should be done to document primer biases 
for species of interest in order to be able to make appropriate infer-
ences about species presence and relative proportion.
