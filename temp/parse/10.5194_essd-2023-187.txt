Abstract. This paper presents two metazoan zooplankton datasets obtained by imaging samples collected on
the Bay of Biscay continental shelf in spring during the PELGAS (PELagique GAScogne) integrated surveys
over the 2004–2019 period. The samples were collected at night with a 200 µm mesh-size WP2 net ﬁtted with
a Hydrobios (back-run stop) mechanical ﬂowmeter and hauled vertically from the sea ﬂoor to the surface, with
the maximum depth set at 100 m when the bathymetry was deeper than this. The ﬁrst dataset originates from
samples collected from 2004 to 2016 and imaged on land with the ZooScan and is composed of 1 153 507 imaged
and measured objects. The second dataset originates from samples collected from 2016 to 2019 and imaged
onboard the R/V Thalassa with the ZooCAM and is composed of 702 111 imaged and measured objects. The
imaged objects are composed of zooplankton individuals, zooplankton pieces, non-living particles and imaging
artefacts ranging from 300 µm to 3.39 mm in equivalent spherical diameter which were individually imaged,

measured and identiﬁed. Each imaged object is geolocated and associated with a station, a survey, a year and
other metadata. Each object is described by a set of morphological and grey-level-based features (8 bit encoding,
0 = black, 255 = white), including size, that were automatically extracted from each individual image. Each
object was taxonomically identiﬁed using the web-based application Ecotaxa with built-in random-forest and
CNN-based semi-automatic sorting tools, which was followed by expert validation or correction. The objects
were sorted into 172 taxonomic and morphological groups. Each dataset features a table combining metadata
and data at individual-object granularity from which one can easily derive quantitative population and community
descriptors such as abundances, mean sizes, biovolumes, biomasses and size structure. Each object’s individual
image is provided along with the data. These two datasets can be used in combination for ecological studies, as
the two instruments are interoperable, or they can be used as training sets for ZooScan and ZooCAM users. The
data presented here are available at the SEANOE dataportal: https://doi.org/10.17882/94052 (ZooScan dataset,
Grandremy et al., 2023c) and https://doi.org/10.17882/94040 (ZooCAM dataset, Grandremy et al., 2023d).

Introduction
Metazoan planktonic organisms, hereafter referred to as zoo-
plankton, encompass an immense diversity of life forms
which have successfully colonized the entire ocean, from
eutrophic estuarine shallow areas to the oligotrophic open
ocean and from the sunlit ocean to hadal depths. Their body
sizes span 5 to 6 orders of magnitude in length: from µm to
tens of metres (Sieburth and Smetacek, 1978). Zooplankton
plays a pivotal role in marine ecosystems (Banse, 1995). It
transfers the organic matter produced in the epipelagic do-
main by photosynthesis to the deeper layers of the ocean
(Siegel et al., 2016) by producing fast-sinking aggregates
(Turner, 2015) and by diel vertical migration (Steinberg et al.,
2000; Ohman and Romagnan, 2016). Zooplankton therefore
participates in mitigating the anthropogenic carbon dioxide
buildup in the atmosphere that is responsible for climate
change. Moreover, zooplankton is an exclusive trophic re-
source for commercially important ﬁsh during their larval
stage, so a shift in zooplankton species or phenology can
have dramatic effects on recruitment (e.g. for North Sea cod;
Beaugrand et al., 2003). In addition, it is a major trophic re-
source for adult small planktivorous pelagic ﬁsh known as
forage ﬁsh (van der Lingen, 2006). Recent studies suggest
that zooplankton dynamics may have a signiﬁcant effect on
small pelagic ﬁsh population dynamics and individual body
condition (Brosset et al., 2016; Menu et al., 2023) and there-
fore impact wasp-waist ecosystem-based ﬁsheries and socio-
ecosystems that are dependent on those ﬁsheries worldwide
(Cury et al., 2000).
Despite zooplankton being of such global importance in
both climate change effects on ecosystems and the manage-
ment of ﬁsheries (Chiba et al., 2018; Lombard et al., 2019),
it is still technically difﬁcult to monitor compared to other
marine ecological compartments. Zooplankton biomass, di-
versity and spatio-temporal distributions cannot be estimated
from spaceborne sensors, unlike those of phytoplankton
(Uitz et al., 2010), commercial exploitation data of zoo-
plankton do not exist yet, unlike the corresponding data
for ﬁsh. One noticeable exception is the CPR Survey net-
work, which enables zooplankton data generation at spatio-
temporal scales that are ﬁne enough to study climate change
and diversity-related zooplanktonic processes (Batten et al.,
2019). Yet, generating zooplankton data often requires ded-
icated surveys at sea, speciﬁc sampling instruments and
trained taxonomic analysts. Moreover, besides actual obser-
vation, modelling zooplankton remains a challenging task
due to the diversity of traits, such as life forms, life cycles,
body sizes, and physiological processes, exhibited by zoo-
plankton (Mitra and Davis, 2010; Mitra et al., 2014). How-
ever, over the past 2 decades, the development of imaging
and associated machine-learning semi-automatic identiﬁca-
tion tools (Irisson et al., 2022) has greatly improved the ca-
pability of scientists to analyse long (Feuilloley et al., 2022),
high-frequency (Romagnan et al., 2016) or spatially resolved
(Grandremy et al., 2023a) zooplankton time series as well
as trait-based data (Orenstein et al., 2022). Imaging and ma-
chine learning have particularly enabled the increased devel-
opment of combined size and taxonomy zooplankton ecolog-
ical studies (e.g. Vandromme et al., 2014; Romagnan et al.,
2016; Benedetti et al., 2019). Yet, the use of these machine-
learning tools is not trivial because they require abundant,
scientiﬁcally qualiﬁed, sensor-speciﬁc training image data
(i.e. a learning set and test set; Irisson et al., 2022) and com-
plex hardware and software setups (Panaïotis et al., 2022).
One good example of such an image dataset is the ZooScan-
Net dataset (Elineau et al., 2018), which features an exten-
sive ZooScan (Gorsky et al., 2010) imaging dataset usable
as a training set for ecologists as well as for imaging and
machine-learning scientists.
The objective of this paper is to present two freely avail-
able zooplankton imaging datasets originating from two dif-
ferent instruments, the ZooScan (Gorsky et al., 2010) and
the ZooCAM (Colas et al., 2018). These datasets originate
from the PELGAS (PELagique GAScogne) integrated sur-
vey in the Bay of Biscay (Doray et al., 2018a), a conti-
nental shelf ecosystem supporting major European ﬁsheries
(ICES, 2021). Combined, these datasets make up a 16-year

time series of sized and taxonomically resolved zooplank-
ton, along with context metadata allowing the calculation of
quantitative data, covering the whole Bay of Biscay conti-
nental shelf from the French coast to the continental slope
and from the Basque Country to southern Brittany in spring.
These datasets can be used for ecological studies (Grandremy
et al., 2023a), machine-learning studies and modelling stud-
ies.

Methods
2.1
Sampling
Zooplankton samples were collected during successive PEL-
GAS integrated surveys carried out over the Bay of Biscay
(BoB) French continental shelf every year in spring from
2004 to 2019 onboard the R/V Thalassa. The aim of this
survey is to assess small pelagic ﬁsh biomass and moni-
tor the pelagic ecosystem to inform ecosystem-based ﬁsh-
eries management. Fish data, hydrology, phyto- and zoo-
plankton samples, and megafauna sightings (marine mam-
mals and seabirds) are concomitantly collected to build long-
term spatially resolved time series of the BoB pelagic ecosys-
tem. The PELGAS sampling protocols combine daytime en-
route data collection (small pelagic ﬁsh and megafauna) with
night-time depth-integrated hydrology and plankton sam-
pling at ﬁxed points. Detailed PELGAS survey protocols can
be found in Doray et al. (2018a, 2021). The PELGAS sur-
vey datasets providing hydrological, primary producers, ﬁsh
and megafauna data are available as gridded data in the SEA-
NOE data portal (Doray et al., 2018b) at the following link:
https://doi.org/10.17882/53389.
The number of zooplankton samples obtained per year var-
ied between 41 (2005) and 65 (2019) due to adjustments
in the sampling strategy and the weather conditions, with
889 zooplankton samples collected in total. From 2004 to
2006, samples were collected in the southern Bay of Bis-
cay up to the Loire estuary only (Fig. 1). Sampling was car-
ried out in vertical tows performed during the night using
a 200 µ m mesh-size WP2 net, generally from 100 m depth
(or 5 m above the seabed) to the surface. In 2004 and 2005,
the targeted maximum sampling depth was 200 m. In 2004,
15 samples were collected deeper than 100 m, among which
11 were deeper than 120 m; in 2005, 20 samples were col-
lected deeper than 100 m, among which 13 were deeper than
120 m. Before 2014, the sampled water volume was esti-
mated by multiplying the cable length by the net opening
surface (0.25 m2), whereas the net has been equipped with a
Hydrobios back-run stop ﬂowmeter since 2014. The samples
originating from the 2004 to 2016 surveys were preserved in
4 % formaldehyde (ﬁnal concentration) and analysed on land
in the laboratory with the ZooScan, while they have been
analysed live onboard with the ZooCAM since 2016.
2.2
Sample processing and analyses
2.2.1
Digitization with the ZooScan
Preserved samples were digitized with the ZooScan (Gorsky
et al., 2010), a ﬂatbed scanner generating 16 bit grey-level
high-resolution images (2400 dpi, pixel size: 10.56 µm, im-
age size: 15 × 24 cm equivalent to 14 200 × 22 700 pixels). It
is well suited for the imaging of preserved organisms rang-
ing in size from 300 µm to several centimetres. The ZooScan
is run by the custom-made, ImageJ-based, ZooProcess soft-
ware, which generates a single large image for each scan that
contains up to 2000 organisms, depending on the size of the
imaged organisms.
Prior to digitization, the seawater and formaldehyde solu-
tion was ﬁltered through a 180 µm mesh sieve into a trash
tank under a fume hood. The organisms were then gently but
thoroughly rinsed with freshwater over the tank in the sieve.
They were then size fractionated with a 1 mm sieve into or-
ganisms larger and smaller than 1 mm. This size-splitting
step is recommended when using the ZooScan as it addresses
the possible bias due to the underrepresentation of large ob-
jects caused by the necessary subsampling. Each size fraction
was subsampled separately with a Motoda splitter to obtain
two subsamples containing 500–1000 objects for the large-
organism size fraction and 1000–2000 objects for the small-
organism size fraction. To mitigate the number of overlap-
ping objects, each subsample was imaged after the manual
separation of objects on the scanning tray, as recommended
in Vandromme et al. (2012). Overall, 699 samples were dig-
itized following this protocol, corresponding to 1397 scans
(one sample was not divided into size fractions as it did not
contain organisms larger than 1 mm).
2.2.2
Digitization with the ZooCAM
The ZooCAM is an in-ﬂow imaging instrument designed to
digitize preserved as well as live zooplankton samples on-
board, immediately after net collection (Colas et al., 2018).
The ZooCAM features a cylindrical transparent tank in
which the zooplankton sample is mixed with ﬁltered seawa-
ter. Depending on the richness of the sample and the subsam-
pling (if necessary), the volume of seawater can be adjusted
between 2–7 L. The organisms were pumped at 1 L min−1
from the tank to a ﬂow cell inserted between a CCD camera
(pixel size: 10.3 µm) and a red LED ﬂashing device, where
they were imaged at 16 fps. Given the ﬂow cell volume, the
size of the ﬁeld of view, the imaging frequency and the ﬂow
rate, all the seawater volume containing the organisms was
imaged (Colas et al., 2018). Before all the initial volume
was imaged, the tank and the tubing were carefully and thor-
oughly rinsed with ﬁltered seawater to ensure the imaging of
all the organisms poured into the tank. For each sample, the
ZooCAM generates a stack of small-size (∼1 MB) raw im-
ages that are subsequently analysed with the ZooCAM soft-
ware. Depending on the initial water content of the tank and

the poorest coverage are 2005 and 2006, with 41 and 43 sampling stations respectively, and the years with the best coverage are 2015, 2017

the rinsing, a ZooCAM run can generate up to 10 000 raw
images from which the individual organism vignettes will be
extracted. A ZooCAM run on a live sample often generates
up to 5000–10 000 vignettes of individual organisms. It is
very important to subsample the initial samples with a di-
chotomic splitter (a Motoda splitter was used here) to ensure
that the object concentration in subsamples is low enough to
reduce the risk of imaging overlapping objects and avoid any
dependency on the water volume imaged when reconstruct-
ing quantitative estimates of zooplankton, as the initial and
rinsing volumes are variable. Overall, 190 samples were dig-
itized live onboard with the ZooCAM.
2.3
Image processing
Both instruments generate grey-level working images (8 bit
encoding, 0 = black, 255 = white). In both cases, image
processing consisted of (i) a “physical” background homog-
enization in which an empty background image was sub-
tracted from each sample image (one for ZooScan and as

many as there were raw images for ZooCAM), (ii) a thresh-
olding of each raw image (the threshold value was 243 for
ZooScan and 240 for ZooCAM), and (iii) the segmentation
of each object imaged. The ZooProcess software was set to
detect and segment objects with an area equal to or larger
than 631 pixels, whereas the ZooCAM software was set to
detect objects with an area equal to or larger than 667 pixels,
which in both cases equals 300 µm equivalent spherical di-
ameter (ESD), or a biovolume of 0.014 mm3 (using a spheri-
cal biovolume model; Vandromme et al., 2012).
Morphological features were then extracted for each de-
tected object. Features generated by the ZooScan are deﬁned
in Gorsky et al. (2010) and those generated by the ZooCAM
are deﬁned in Colas et al. (2018). ZooScan images were pro-
cessed with the ZooProcess v7.39 (4 October 2020) open-
source software. ZooCAM images were processed with the
proprietary ZooCAM custom-made software, which uses the
MIL (Matrox Imaging Library, Dorval, Québec, Canada) as
the individual-object processing kernel. Each detected ob-
ject was ﬁnally cropped from the working sample images
and saved as a unique labelled vignette in a sample-speciﬁc
folder, along with a sample-speciﬁc single text ﬁle containing
the object features arranged as a table with objects arranged
in lines and features in columns.
2.4
Touching objects
ZooProcess features a tool that enables the digital separa-
tion of possibly touching objects in the ﬁnal image dataset
for each sample. As touching objects may impair abundance
and size-structure estimations (Vandromme et al., 2012), re-
maining touching objects were searched for in the individ-
ual vignettes from the ZooScan and were digitally manually
separated with the ZooProcess separation tool to improve the
quality of further identiﬁcations, counts and the size structure
of zooplankton. The ZooCAM software does not offer such
a tool.
2.5
Taxonomic identiﬁcation of individual images
All individual vignettes from both instruments were sorted
into two instrument-speciﬁc separated sets and identiﬁed
with the help of the online application Ecotaxa (Picheral
et al., 2017). Ecotaxa features a random forest algorithm
(Breiman, 2001) and a series of instrument-speciﬁc tuned
spatially sparse convolutional neural networks (Graham,
2014) that were used in a combined approach to predict iden-
tiﬁcations of unidentiﬁed objects. First, an automatic clas-
siﬁcation of non-identiﬁed individual vignettes into coarse
zooplankton and non-zooplankton categories was carried
out. In both cases (ZooScan and ZooCAM), Ecotaxa hosted
instrument-speciﬁc image datasets, previously curated and
freely available, that were used as initial learning sets. These
initial classiﬁcations were then visually inspected, manually
validated or corrected when necessary, and taxonomically re-
ﬁned when possible. After a few thousand images had been
validated in each project, they were used as dataset-speciﬁc
learning sets to improve the initial coarse automatic identiﬁ-
cations. This process was iterated until all the individual vi-
gnettes were classiﬁed up to their maximum reachable level
of taxonomical detail. A subsequent quality check of auto-
matic taxonomic identiﬁcations was realized in a two-step
process: ﬁrst, a complete review (validation and/or correc-
tion) of all individual automatic identiﬁcations was done by
Nina Grandremy and Jean-Baptiste Romagnan; then, trained
experts reviewed and curated the ZooScan and the ZooCAM
datasets (Laeticia Jalabert handled the ZooScan dataset and
Antoine Nowaczyk handled the ZooCAM dataset) at the in-
dividual level. Although some identiﬁcation errors may still
remain in the datasets, we consider this double check process
to be sufﬁcient to provide taxonomically qualiﬁed data.
2.6
Intercalibration of the two instruments
The two datasets are usable separately. However, considered
together, they form a 16-year-long spatio-temporal time se-
ries. A comparison study was done to ensure these datasets
are homogeneous and can thus be combined for ecological
studies (Grandremy et al., 2023b). All the zooplankton sam-
ples from year 2016 (61 sampling stations over the whole
BoB continental shelf) were imaged with both instruments.
In brief, all non-zooplankton and touching-object images
were removed from the initial datasets. Then, the interop-
erable size range was determined with an assessment based
on a comparison of the normalized biovolume–size spectra
(NB-SSs) for the instruments. This size interval ranges be-
tween 0.3–3.39 mm ESD. Finally, the zooplankton commu-
nities as seen by the ZooScan and the ZooCAM were com-
pared by taxa and by station using 27 taxonomic groups.
Poorly represented taxa as well as non-taxonomically identi-
ﬁed objects were not taken into account in the computation
of zooplankton variables and in community structure analy-
ses. Both instruments showed similar NB-SS slopes for 58
out of 61 stations and depicted equivalent abundances, bio-
volumes and mean organism sizes as well as similar com-
munity compositions for a majority of the sampling stations.
They also estimated similar spatial patterns of the zooplank-
ton community at the scale of the Bay of Biscay. However,
some taxonomic groups showed discrepancies between in-
struments, which originate from differences in the sample
preparation protocols before image acquisition, the imag-
ing techniques and quality, and whether the samples were
imaged live or ﬁxed. For example, the mineralized protists
(Rhizaria here) dissolve in formalin and are considered to
be underestimated in preserved seawater samples (Biard et
al., 2016). Also, the random orientation of objects in the
ZooCAM ﬂow cell leads to a loss of taxonomic identiﬁcation
accuracy due to the difﬁculty in spotting the speciﬁc features
needed for the identiﬁcation (Colas et al., 2018; Grandremy
et al., 2023b). This is particularly acute for copepods, for

N. Grandremy et al.: Metazoan zooplankton in the Bay of Biscay
which the ZooScan seems to provide better identiﬁcation ca-
pabilities for experts, as the organisms are imaged in a lateral
view most of the time, whereas the ZooCAM often images
them in a non-lateral, randomly oriented view, preventing
the visualization of speciﬁc features. A detailed discussion
about how to explain the discrepancies between the ZooScan
and the ZooCAM can be found in Grandremy et al. (2023b).
We assume that the two presented datasets form a single 16-
year-long spatio-temporal time series of abundances (Fig. 2)
and sizes of zooplanktonic organisms (Fig. 3) from which
biovolumes, biomasses, the Shannon index (Fig. 4) and the
zooplankton community size structure can be derived (Van-
dromme et al., 2012).

Datasets
3.1
Taxonomic groups and operational morphological
groups
The ZooScan dataset is composed of 1 153 507 zooplank-
ton individuals, zooplankton parts, non-living particles and
imaging artefacts individually imaged and measured with
the ZooScan and ZooProcess (Gorsky et al., 2010) and
sorted into 127 taxonomic and morphological groups. The
ZooCAM dataset is composed of 702 111 zooplankton in-
dividuals, zooplankton parts, non-living particles and imag-
ing artefacts individually imaged and measured with the
ZooCAM (Colas et al., 2018) and sorted into 127 taxonomic
and morphological or life-stage groups. The total number of
different groups identiﬁed with both instruments combined is
170, among which 84 are common to both datasets (Table 1),
43 belong to the ZooScan dataset only and 43 others belong
to the ZooCAM dataset only (Table 2). The identiﬁed groups
were divided into actual taxa and operational morphologi-
cal groups (OMGs). Typically, OMGs are either non-adult
life stages of taxa, aggregated morphological groups, or non-
living groups (see Tables 1 and 2). Among the groups com-
mon to both instruments, 45 are actual taxa and 39 are OMGs
(Table 1). Among the ZooScan-only groups, 22 are taxa and
21 are OMGs, and among the ZooCAM-only groups, 18 are
taxa and 25 are OMGs (Table 2).
The differences in identiﬁed groups, in the taxa/OMGs ra-
tio and in the associated counts arose from several aspects of
the data generation. Firstly, the two imaging methods differ
in their technical set-up. The main difference is that, on the
one hand, ﬁxed organisms are laid down and arranged man-
ually on the imaging sensor and digitized in a lab (i.e. steady
2-D) set-up when using the ZooScan, whereas organisms are
imaged live in a moving ﬂuid in a 3-D environment (the ﬂow
cell) onboard when digitized with the ZooCAM. Their posi-
tion in front of the camera may not enable an identiﬁcation
as precise as that achieved when they are laid on the scanner
tray (Grandremy et al., 2023b; Colas et al., 2018). Secondly,
the datasets are sequential in time: the ZooCAM dataset fol-
lows the ZooScan’s. Zooplankton communities in the Bay of
Biscay may have changed over time, even if their biomass
as aggregated groups shows remarkable space-time stabil-
ity (Grandremy et al., 2023a). Thirdly, we cannot guaranty
that there is no adverse effect on taxonomic identiﬁcation,
as validation involved several experts (Culverhouse, 2007).
Although we paid great attention to homogenizing the ﬁ-
nal detailed datasets, we recommend that taxa and OMGs
should be aggregated and the biological resolution should be
reduced for ecological studies (Grandremy et al., 2023a, b).
Additionally, numerous identiﬁed and sorted taxa and OMGs
do not belong to the metazoan zooplankton or they are non-
adult life stages or parts of organisms. Those were included
in the presented datasets because they are always found in
natural samples. They need to be separated from entire or-
ganisms to ensure that abundance estimations are as accurate
as possible, and they must be taken into account to ensure
accurate biovolume or biomass estimations. A good example
is the siphonophore issue: numerous swimming bells of de-
graded siphonophore individuals can be found and imaged in
a sample. Determining an accurate siphonophore abundance
may not be easy, but this could be overcome by considering
the biovolume or biomass of siphonophores by adding up the
biovolumes or biomasses of the numerous parts of the organ-
isms imaged.
OMG names mainly take the form of two words separated
by “_” (underscore). Although we tried to name them as ex-
plicitly as possible, a few potentially needed clariﬁcations
can be found in Table 3.
3.2
Data and images
3.2.1
Data
The data are divided into two datasets available as tab-
separated ﬁles, one for each instrument. Within each dataset,
the data is organized as a table containing text data as well as
numerical data. Each dataset contains a combination of ac-
tual data and metadata at individual-object granularity. For
each object, the user can ﬁnd descriptors originating from
the image processing (i.e. features), sampling metadata (i.e.
latitude and longitude of the sampling station, date and time
of sampling, sampling device, etc.), and sample processing
metadata (i.e. subsampling factor, seawater sampled volume,
pixel size) in columns and individual objects in lines. The
column headers are deﬁned in Tables A1 and A2 for the
ZooCAM and ZooScan datasets respectively. The following
preﬁxes enable the segregation of types of data and metadata:
(i) “object_”, which identiﬁes variables assigned to each ob-
ject individually; (ii) “sample_”, which identiﬁes variables
assigned to each sample; (iii) “acq_”, which identiﬁes vari-
ables assigned to each data acquisition for the same sample
(note that this type of variable is only found in the ZooScan
dataset, as ZooScan samples were split into two size frac-
tions corresponding to two acquisitions); and (iv) “process_”,
which identiﬁes variables describing key image processing

Figure 2. Gridded maps of total zooplankton abundances (expressed in individuals per cubic metre of sampled seawater) during the PELGAS
cruises in the Bay of Biscay from 2004 to 2019. The abundances are well within the range of zooplankton abundances seen over other
temperate continental shelves. They exhibit a marked coastal to offshore gradient, with abundances being higher at the coast. Abundances
also show an overall increase over the years. The gridding procedure is presented in Petitgas et al. (2009, 2014). See also Doray et al. (2018c)
and Grandremy et al. (2023a) for application examples.
features (i.e. pixel size). Those preﬁxes originate from the
use of the Ecotaxa web application to sort and identify the
images (Picheral et al., 2017), which promotes this speciﬁc
formatting. The ZooCAM dataset is arranged as a matrix
with 72 columns (variables) × 702 111 rows (individual im-
aged objects), and the ZooScan dataset is arranged as a ma-
trix with 71 columns (variables) × 1 153 507 rows (individual
imaged objects).
Among the 70+ variables, it is worth noting the following
ones:
i. objid: this is a unique individual object numerical iden-
tiﬁer that enables a single data line to be linked to a
corresponding single image in the image dataset.
ii. taxon: this is the taxonomic or OMG identiﬁcation of
the imaged objects, written as they appear in Tables 1
and 2.
iii. lineage: this is the full taxonomic lineage of the taxon.
Lineage may be used to aggregate taxa at higher taxo-
nomic levels (respecting taxonomic lineages).
iv. classif_id: This is a unique numerical taxon identiﬁer.

Figure 3. Gridded maps of total zooplankton mean size (expressed in mm equivalent spherical diameter) during the PELGAS cruise in the
Bay of Biscay from 2004 to 2019. They exhibit a coastal to offshore gradient as well as a north–south gradient. Mean body sizes are smaller
at the coast and usually smaller in the south. In general, mean body sizes show an overall decrease over the years. The gridding procedure is
presented in Petitgas et al. (2009, 2014). See also Doray et al. (2018c) and Grandremy et al. (2023a) for application examples.
v. sample_sub_part/acq_sub_part: these are the subsam-
pling ratios for ZooCAM and ZooScan respectively,
which are needed to reconstruct the quantitative esti-
mates of the sample abundances.
vi. sample_ﬁshingvolume/sample_tot_vol: these are the
total sampled seawater volumes for ZooCAM and
ZooScan respectively, which are needed to normalize
the sample concentrations by the seawater volume.
One can therefore calculate quantitative abundance esti-
mates for a taxon in a sample as follows:
ZooCAM: Abtaxon = ntaxon × sample_sub_part
sample_ ﬁshingvolume
(1)
ZooScan: Abtaxon =

ntaxonacq1 × acq_sub_partacq1

+

ntaxonacq2 × acq_sub_partacq2

sample_tot_vol
,
(2)
where Ab is the abundance in ind m−3 and n is the number
of individuals for “taxon”.

Images
There are two sets of individual images sorted into folders by
category (Tables 1 and 2) in each dataset. For the ZooCAM
only, the images from years 2016 and 2017 contain printed
region of interest (ROI) bounding-box limits and text at the
bottom of each image and a non-homogenized background
within and around the ROI bounding box; images from year
2018 contain a non-homogenized background within the ROI
bounding box only; and images from 2019 have a completely
homogeneous and thresholded background around the ob-
ject. These differences arose from successive ZooCAM soft-
ware updates that did not modify the calculation of an ob-
ject’s features. The ZooScan images all have a completely
homogeneous and thresholded background around the ob-
ject, with no bounding-box limits nor text printed in the im-
ages. All images for the two instruments’ datasets have a
1 mm scale bar printed at the bottom left corner.

Concluding remarks
Recent studies showed that small pelagic ﬁsh (SPF) commu-
nities have suffered from a drastic loss of condition in the
Mediterranean Sea and in the Bay of Biscay (Van Beveren
et al., 2014; Doray et al., 2018d; Saraux et al., 2019) over
the last 20 years. This loss of condition is expressed in par-
ticular as a constant decrease in SPF size- and weight-at-age
(Doray et al., 2018d; Véron et al., 2020) and is possibly ex-
plained by a change in SPF trophic resource composition,
size and quality (Brosset et al., 2016; Queiros et al., 2019;
Menu et al., 2023). Identifying and measuring zooplankton
at appropriate temporal and spatial scales is not an easy task,
but it can be addressed with imaging. These datasets were as-
sembled in an effort to make possible the exploration of the
relationship between the observed dynamics of SPF in the
Bay of Biscay and the dynamics of their main food resource,
metazoan zooplankton. This zooplankton imaging data se-
ries is a signiﬁcant output of Nina Grandremy’s PhD (2019–
2023), and is currently being exploited (Grandremy et al.,
2023a), and the intention is to continue this series and update
it on a yearly basis in the framework of the PELGAS pro-
gram to better understand the underlying processes presiding
over the long-term SPF dynamics. Moreover, those two zoo-
plankton datasets can be associated with the PELGAS survey
datasets published in 2018 (which can also be found at the
SEANOE data portal), which feature hydrological, primary
producers, ﬁsh and megafauna data arranged as gridded data
(Doray et al., 2018b). Together, all these datasets allow all of
the pelagic ecosystem compartments to be studied simultane-
ously with a coherent spatial domain (the Bay of Biscay con-
tinental shelf), resolution and time series. Nevertheless, spa-
tial gridding of the data is highly recommended (as presented
in Figs. 2, 3 and 4), since the spatial coverage of the sampling
protocols can vary between years (Fig. 1) within and between
each pelagic ecosystem compartment. A procedure for such
batch data spatial smoothing is presented in, for example, Pe-
titgas et al. (2009, 2014). See also Doray et al. (2018c) and
Grandremy et al. (2023a) for application examples. As sev-
eral descriptors of the spring zooplankton community (abun-
dances, sizes, biovolumes, biomass) can be derived from this
16-year-long spatially resolved time series at several taxo-
nomic levels, these datasets are intended to be used in various
ecological studies that include the zooplankton compartment,
especially in modelling studies, where zooplankton is usually
underrepresented (Mitra, 2010; Mitra et al., 2014). Finally,
these datasets could also be applied as learning datasets when
machine learning is used in plankton studies.
