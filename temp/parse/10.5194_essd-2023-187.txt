The samples were collected at night, with a WP2 200 µm mesh size fitted with a Hydrobios (back-run stop) mechanical flowmeter, hauled vertically from the sea floor to the surface with a maximum depth set at 100 m when the bathymetry is deeper.  The first dataset originates from samples collected from 2004 to 2016, imaged on land with the ZooScan and is composed of 1,153,507 imaged and measured objects.  The second dataset originates from samples collected from 2016 to 2019, imaged on board the R/V Thalassa with the ZooCAM and is composed of 702,111 imaged and measured objects.  The imaged objects is composed of zooplankton individuals, zooplankton pieces, non-living particles and imaging artefacts, ranging from 300 µm to 3.39 mm Equivalent Spherical Diameter, individually imaged, measured and identified.  Each imaged object is geolocated, associated to a station, a survey, a year and other metadata.  Each object is described by a set of morphological and grey level based features (8 bits encoding, 0 = black, 255 = white), including size, automatically extracted on each individual image. 

 Each object was taxonomically identified using the web based application Ecotaxa with built-in, random forest and CNN based, semi-automatic sorting tools followed by expert validation or correction.  The objects were sorted in 172 taxonomic and morphological groups.  Each dataset features a table combining metadata and data, at the individual object granularity, from which one can easily derive quantitative population and communities descriptors such as abundances, mean sizes, biovolumes, biomasses, and size structure.  Each object's individual image is provided along with the data.  These two datasets can be used combined together for ecological studies as the two instruments are interoperable, or as training sets for ZooScan and ZooCAM users. 



    Introduction Metazoan heterotrophic planktonic organisms, hereafter referred to as zooplankton, encompass an immense diversity of life forms, which have successfully colonized the entire ocean, from eutrophic estuarine shallow areas to oligotrophic open ocean, from sunlit ocean to hadal depth.  Their body sizes span five to six orders of magnitude in length, from µm to tens of meters (Sieburth & Smetacek, 1978) .   Zooplankton plays a pivotal role in marine ecosystem (Banse, 1995) .   It transfers the organic matter produced in the epipelagic domain by photosynthesis to the deeper layers of the ocean (Siegel et al., 2016) , by producing fast sinking aggregates  (Turner, 2015) , and by diel vertical migration  (Steinberg et al., 2000;  Ohman & Romagnan, 2016) .   Zooplankton therefore participates in mitigating the anthropogenic carbon dioxide build up in the atmosphere responsible for climate change.  Moreover, zooplankton is an exclusive trophic resource for commercially important fish during their larval stage, where a shift in zooplankton species or phenology can have dramatic effects on recruitment (i.e.  North Sea cod, Beaugrand et al., 2003) .   In addition, it is a major trophic resource for adult planktivorous small pelagic fish, known as forage fishes ( Van der Lingen, 2006) .   Recent studies suggest that zooplankton dynamics may have a significant effect on small pelagic fish population dynamics and individual body condition (Brosset et al., 2016;  Menu et al., 2023) , and therefore impact wasp-waist ecosystem based fisheries and fisheries dependent socioecosystems, worldwide  (Cury et al., 2000) .  

 Despite zooplankton being of such global importance in both climate change effects on ecosystems and management of fisheries (Chiba et al., 2018;  Lombard et al., 2019) , it is still technically difficult to monitor, with respect to other marine ecological compartments.   Zooplankton biomass, diversity and spatio-temporal distributions cannot be estimated from spaceborne sensors as phytoplankton's does (Uitz et al., 2010) , and zooplankton commercial exploitation data do not exist yet, as fish data does.   One noticeable exception is the CPR surveys network that enables zooplankton data generation at decent spatio-temporal scales (Batten et al., 2019) .  

 Yet, generating zooplankton data often requires dedicated surveys at sea, specific sampling instruments and trained analysts.  Moreover, besides actual observation, modelling zooplankton remains a challenging task due to the diversity of traits such as life forms, life cycles, body sizes and physiological processes exhibited by zooplankton (Mitra & Davis 2010;  Mitra et al., 2014) .   However, over the past two decades the development of imaging and associated machine learning semi-automatic identification tools (Irisson et al., 2022) have greatly improved the capability of scientists to analyse long  (Feuilloley et al., 2022) , high frequency  (Romagnan et al., 2016) , or spatially resolved  (Grandremy et al., 2023a) zooplankton time series, as well as trait based data  (Orenstein et al., 2022) .  

 Imaging and machine learning have particularly enabled the increased development of combined size and taxonomy zooplankton ecological studies (i.e.  Vandromme et al., 2014;  Romagnan et al., 2016;  Benedetti et al., 2019 ).   Yet, use of these machine learning tools is not trivial because those often require abundant, scientifically qualified, sensor specific, training image data (i.e.  learning set and test set, Irisson et al., 2022) , and complex hardware and software setups  (Panaïotis et al., 2022) .   One good example of such image dataset is the ZooScanNet dataset (Elineau et al., 2018) , which features an extensive ZooScan  (Gorsky et al., 2010) imaging dataset usable as a training set for ecologists as well as for imaging and machine learning scientists.  

 The objective of this paper is to present two open zooplankton imaging datasets, originating from two different instruments, the ZooScan (Gorsky et al., 2010) , and the ZooCAM  (Colas et al., 2018) .   These datasets originate from the PELGAS integrated survey in the Bay of Biscay (Doray et al., 2018)  



 Digitization with the ZooCAM The ZooCAM is an in-flow imaging instrument, designed to digitize preserved as well as live zooplankton samples, on board, immediately after collection (Colas et al., 2018) .   The ZooCAM features a cylindrical transparent tank in which the zooplankton sample is mixed with filtered seawater.  Depending on the richness of the sample, and the subsampling (if necessary), the volume of seawater can be adjusted between 2-7 litres.  The organisms were pumped at a 1L.min -1 from the tank to a flowcell inserted between a CCD camera (pixel size: 10.3 µm) and a red LED flashing device where they were imaged at 16 fps.  Given the flowcell volume, the size of the field of view, the imaging frequency and the flowrate, all the seawater volume containing the organisms was imaged (Colas et al., 2018) .   Before all the initial volume was imaged, the tank and the tubing were carefully and thoroughly rinsed with filtered seawater to ensure the imaging of all the organisms poured in the tank.  For each sample, the ZooCAM generates a stack of small size (~1 Mo) raw images that are subsequently analysed with the ZooCAM software.  Depending on the initial water content of the tank and the rinsing, a ZooCAM run can generate up to 10k raw images from which the individual organism vignettes will be extracted.  A ZooCAM run on a live sample often generates up to 5000-10000 vignettes of individual organisms.  It is very important to subsample the initial samples with a dichotomic splitter (here a Motoda splitter), to get subsamples with a quantity of objects that reduce the risk of imaging overlapping objects, and to break free from the dependency to the water volume imaged to reconstruct quantitative estimates of zooplankton as the initial and rinsing volume are variable.  Overall,  190 samples were digitized live on-board with the ZooCAM.  



 Images processing Both instruments generate grey level working images (8 bit encoding, 0 = black, 255 = white).  In both cases, image processing consisted in (i) a "physical" background homogenization by subtracting an empty background image to each sample image (1 for ZooScan, and as many as raw images for ZooCAM), (ii) a thresholding of each raw image (threshold value: 243 for ZooScan, 240 for ZooCAM), (iii) the segmentation of each object imaged.  The ZooProcess software was set to detect and segment objects with an area equal or larger than 631 pixels, whereas the ZooCAM software was set to detect objects with an area equal or larger than 667 pixels, which in both cases equals 300 µm ESD, or a biovolume of 0.014 mm 3 (using a spherical biovolume model, Vandromme et al., 2012) .  

 Morphological features were then extracted on each detected object.  Features generated by the ZooScan are defined in Gorsky et al. (2010) and those generated by the ZooCAM are defined in  Colas et al. (2018) .   ZooScan images were processed with ZooProcess v7.39 (04/10/2020) open source software.  ZooCAM images were processed with the proprietary ZooCAM custom made software which uses the MIL (Matrox Imaging Library, Dorval, Québec, Canada) as the individual object processing kernel.  Each detected object was finally cropped from the working sample images, and saved as a unique, labelled vignette, in a sample specific folder along with a sample specific single text file containing the objects features arranged as a table with objects arranged in lines and features in columns. 



 Touching objects The ZooProcess features a tool that enable the digital separation of possible touching objects in the final image dataset, for each sample.  As touching objects may impair the estimations of abundances and size structure https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2023-187  Preprint.  Discussion started: 1 June 2023 c Author(s) 2023.  CC BY 4.0 License.  (Vandromme et al., 2012) , remaining touching objects were searched for on the individual vignettes from the ZooScan and digitally manually separated with the ZooProcess separation tool to improve the quality of further identifications, counts and size structure of zooplankton.   ZooCAM does not offer such a tool. 



 Taxonomic identification of individual images All individual vignettes from both instruments were sorted and identified with the help of the online application Ecotaxa (Picheral et al., 2017) , as two instrument-specific separated sets.   Ecotaxa features a Random Forest algorithm (Breiman, 2001) and a series of instruments specific tuned spatially sparse Convolutional Neural Networks  (Graham, 2014) that were used in a combined approach to predict identifications of unidentified objects.  

 First, an automatic classification of non-identified individual vignettes into coarse zooplankton and nonzooplankton categories was carried out.  In both cases (ZooScan and ZooCAM), Ecotaxa hosted instrument specific image datasets, previously curated and freely available, were used as initial learning sets.  These initial classifications were then visually inspected, manually validated or corrected when necessary, and taxonomically refined when possible.  After a few thousand images were validated in each project, they were used as dataset specific learning sets to improve the initial coarse automatic identifications.  This process was iterated until all the individual vignettes were classified into their maximum reachable taxonomical detail.  It is worth mentioning here that only a handful of taxonomists worked on identification of the two images sets. 



 Intercalibration of the two instruments The two datasets are usable separately.  However, considered together they build a 16 years long spatiotemporal time series.  To ensure they are homogeneous and can thus be used together for ecological studies, we conducted a comparison study using samples from year 2016 (61 stations over the whole Bay of Biscay continental shelf, Grandremy et al., under review) .   In brief, all non-zooplankton and touching objects images were removed from the initial datasets.  Then, the interoperable size range was determined with an assessment based on the comparison of Normalized Biovolume -Size Spectra (NB-SS) for each instrument.  This size interval ranges between [0.3-3.39]  mm ESD.  Finally, the zooplankton communities as seen by the ZooScan and the ZooCAM were compared by taxa and by station using 27 taxonomic groups.  Poorly represented taxa as well as nontaxonomically identified objects were not taken into account in the zooplankton variables computation and in community structure analyses.  Both instruments showed similar NB-SS slopes for 58 out of 61 stations; depicted comparable abundances, biovolumes and mean organisms' sizes, as well as similar community composition for a majority of sampling stations.  They also estimated similar spatial patterns of the zooplankton community at the scale of the Bay of Biscay.  We therefore assume that the two presented datasets build a single, 16 years long spatiotemporal time series of abundances (Fig. 2 ) and sizes of zooplanktonic organisms (Fig.  3 ), from which biovolumes, biomasses, Shannon index (Fig.  4 ), and zooplankton community size structure can be derived  (Vandromme et al., 2012) .   The total number of different groups identified with both instruments combined is 170, among which 84 are in common (Table 1 ), 43 belong to the ZooScan dataset only and 43 others belong to the ZooCAM dataset only (Table  2 ).   The identified groups were divided into actual taxa and Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs). 

 Typically, OTUs are either non-adult life stages of taxa, aggregated morphological groups, or non-living groups (see Tables 1 and  2 ).   Among the groups common to both instruments, 45 are actual taxa, and 39 are OTUs (Table 1 ).   Among the ZooScan only groups, 22 are taxa, and 21 are OTUs, and among the ZooCAM only groups, 18 are taxa, and 25 are OTUs (Table 2 ).  

 The differences in identified groups, in the ratio taxa/OTUs, and in the associated counts arose from several aspects of the data generation.  Firstly, the two imaging methods differ in their technical set-up.  The main difference is that, on the one hand, fixed organisms are laid down and arranged manually on the imaging sensor and digitized in a lab, steady 2-D, set-up when using the ZooScan.  On the other hand, organisms are imaged live, in a moving fluid, in a 3-D environment (the flowcell), on-board when digitized with the ZooCAM.  Their position in front of the camera may not enable an identification as precise as when they are laid on the scanner tray (Grandremy et al., under review;  Colas et al., 2018) .   Secondly, the dataset are sequential in time, the ZooCAM dataset follows the ZooScan's.  Zooplankton communities in the Bay of Biscay may have changed over time, even if their biomass as aggregated groups show a remarkable space-time stability (Grandremy et al., 2023a) .   Thirdly, we cannot guaranty that there is no adverse effect on taxonomic identification, as validation involved several experts (Culverhouse, 2007) .   Although we paid great attention to homogenize the final detailed datasets, we recommend to aggregate taxa and OTUs and reduce the biological resolution for ecological studies (Grandremy et al., 2023a, under review) .   Additionally, numerous identified and sorted taxa and OTUs do not belong to the metazoan zooplankton, or are non-adult life stages, or parts of organisms.  Those were included in the presented datasets because they are always found in natural samples.  They need to be separated from entire organisms to ensure as accurate as possible abundances estimations, as well as taken into account to ensure accurate biovolumes or biomasses estimations.  A good example is the siphonophore issue: numerous swimming bells of degraded siphonophores individuals can be found and imaged in a sample.  Determining an accurate siphonophore abundance may not be easy, but this could be overcome by considering the biovolume or biomass of siphonophores by adding up the numerous parts' biovolumes or biomass of the organisms imaged.  OTUs' names are mainly in the form of two words separated by a "<" character.  Although we tried to name them as most explicitly as possible, a few potentially needed clarifications can be found in Table 3 .

 Data and images  Data The data is divided into two datasets available as tab separated files, one for each instrument.  Within each dataset the data is organized as a table containing text data as well as numerical data.  Each dataset combines together actual data and metadata at the individual object granularity.  For each object, the user will be able to find descriptors originating from the image processing (i.e.  features), and sampling metadata (i.e.  latitude and longitude of sampling station, date and time of sampling, sampling device, etc.) and sample processing metadata (i.e.  subsampling factor, seawater sampled volume, pixel size), in columns, and individual objects in lines.  The columns headers are defined in Tables A1 and  A2 for ZooCAM and ZooScan datasets respectively.   The following prefixes enable the segregation of types of data and metadata: (i) "object_", which identifies variables assigned to each object individually; (ii) "sample_", which identifies variables assigned to each sample; (iii) "acq_", which identifies variables assigned to each data acquisition for the same sample (note here that this type of variable is found only in the ZooScan dataset as ZooScan samples were splitted in two size fractions corresponding to two acquisitions); (iv) "process_", which identifies variables describing key image processing features (i.e.  pixel size). 

 Those prefixes originate from the use of the Ecotaxa web application to sort and identify the images (Picheral et al., 2017) that promote this specific formatting.   The ZooCAM dataset is shaped as a 72 columns (variables) x 702,111 rows (individual imaged objects) matrix and the ZooScan dataset is shaped as a 71 columns (variables) x 1,153,507 rows (individual imaged objects) matrix. 

 Among the 70+ variables it is worth noticing the following ones: 

 (i) objid: it is a unique individual object numerical identifier that enables to link single data line to a corresponding single image in the image dataset; 

 (ii) taxon: it is the taxonomic or OTU identification of the imaged objects written as they appear in the Tables 1 and  2; (iii) lineage: it is the full taxonomic lineage of the taxon.   Lineage may be used to aggregate taxa at a higher taxonomic levels, respecting taxonomic lineages; 

 (iv) classif_id: it is a unique, numerical, taxon identifier; 

 (v) sample_sub_part / acq_sub_part: those are the subsampling ratios, for ZooCAM and ZooScan respectively, needed to reconstruct the quantitative estimates of the samples' abundances; 

 (vi) sample_fishingvolume / sample_tot_vol: those are the total seawater sampled volumes for ZooCAM and ZooScan respectively, needed to normalize the samples' concentrations by seawater volume. 

 One can therefore calculate quantitative abundances estimates for a taxon in a sample as follow: 

 ZooCAM: 𝐴𝑏 𝑡𝑎𝑥𝑜𝑛 = 𝑛 𝑡𝑎𝑥𝑜𝑛 ×𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒_𝑠𝑢𝑏_𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑡 𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒_𝑓𝑖𝑠ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒 (1)   ZooScan:   𝐴𝑏 𝑡𝑎𝑥𝑜𝑛 = (𝑛 𝑡𝑎𝑥𝑜𝑛 𝑎𝑐𝑞1 ×𝑎𝑐𝑞_𝑠𝑢𝑏_𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑡 𝑎𝑐𝑞1 )+(𝑛 𝑡𝑎𝑥𝑜𝑛 𝑎𝑐𝑞2 ×𝑎𝑐𝑞_𝑠𝑢𝑏_𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑡 𝑎𝑐𝑞2 ) 𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒_𝑡𝑜𝑡_𝑣𝑜𝑙 ( 2   )  Where Ab is the abundance in ind.m -3 and n is the number of individuals for "taxon". 



 Images Two sets of individual images sorted into folders by categories (Tables 1 and  2  



 Data availability The ZooScan dataset can be found as the PELGAS Bay of Biscay ZooScan zooplankton Dataset (2004  Dataset ( -2016) ) in the SEANOE dataportal following the link: https://www.seanoe.org/data/00829/94052/   (Grandremy et al., 2023b) .  

 The ZooCAM dataset can be found as the PELGAS Bay of Biscay ZooCAM zooplankton Dataset (2016-2019) in the SEANOE dataportal https://www.seanoe.org/data/00828/94040/  (Grandremy et al., 2023c) .  

 Each dataset comes as a .zip  archive that contains: 

  One tab separated file containing all data and metadata associated to each imaged and identified object. 

  One comma separated file containing the name, type, definition and unit of each field (column) 

  One comma separated file containing the taxonomic list of the dataset, with counts and nature of the content of the category  A directory "individual_images" containing images of each object, named according to the object id objid and sorted in subdirectories according to their taxonomic identification, across years and sampling stations. 



 Concluding remarks Recent studies showed that the small pelagic fish (SPF) communities have suffered from a drastic decrease of condition in the Mediterranean Sea and in the Bay of Biscay (Van Beveren et al., 2014;  Doray et al., 2018b;  Saraux et al., 2019) over the last 20 years.   This loss of condition was especially expressed by the constant decrease of SPF size-and weight-at-age (Doray et al., 2018b;  Veron et al. 2020) , and possibly explained by a change in SPF trophic resource composition, size and quality  (Brosset et al., 2016;  Queiros et al., 2019;  Menu et al., 2023) .   Identifying and measuring zooplankton at appropriate temporal and spatial scales is not an easy task, but can be addressed with imaging.  These datasets were assembled as an effort to make possible the exploration of the relationship between SPF observed dynamics in the Bay of Biscay and their main food resource's dynamics, the metazoan zooplankton.  This zooplankton imaging data series is a significant output of Nina Grandremy PhD (2019  -2023) , that is currently being exploited  (Grandremy et al., 2023a) , and is intended to be continued and updated on a yearly basis in the framework of the PELGAS program, to better understand the underlying processes presiding to long-term SPF dynamics.   Moreover, those two zooplankton datasets can be associated with the PELGAS survey datasets previously published in 2018, also in the SEANOE dataportal, featuring hydrological, primary producers, fish and megafauna data arranged as gridded data (Doray et al., 2018a) .   Together, all these between years (Fig. 1 ), within and between each pelagic ecosystem compartment.   A procedure for such batch data spatial smoothing is presented e.g. in Petitgas et al. (2009  Petitgas et al. ( , 2014)) .   See also Doray et al. (2018b) and  Grandremy et al. (2023a) for application examples.   As several descriptors of the spring zooplankton community (abundances, sizes, biovolumes, biomass) can be derived from this 16 years long spatially resolved time series at several taxonomic levels, these datasets are intended to be used in various ecological studies including the zooplankton compartment, especially modelling studies, where zooplankton is usually underrepresented (Mitra, 2010;  Mitra et al., 2014) .   Finally, these datasets can also be used for machine learning applied to plankton studies serving, for example, as consequent learning sets.

   Figure 2 : 2  Figure 2: Gridded maps of total zooplankton abundances expressed as individuals per cubic meters of sampled seawater, during the PELGAS cruises in the Bay of Biscay from 2004 to 2019.  The abundances are well within the range of zooplankton abundances seen over other temperate continental shelves.  They exhibit a marked coastal to offshore gradient, abundances being higher at the coast.  Abundances also show an overall increase over the years.

For the ZooCAM only, the associated images from years 2016 and 2017 contain printed Region Of Interest (ROI) bounding box limits and text at the bottom of each image, and non-homogenised background within and around the ROI bounding box; images from year 2018 contain non-homogenised background within the ROI bounding box only; images from 2019 have a completely homogeneous and thresholded background around the object.  The differences arose from successive ZooCAM software updates that do not modify the calculation of object's features.  The ZooScan images have all a completely homogeneous and thresholded background around the object, no bounding box limits nor text printed in the images.  All images for the two instruments datasets have a 1 mm scale bar printed at the bottom left corner.
