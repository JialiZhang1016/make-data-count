Abstract
Acacia longifolia (Sydney golden wattle) is considered one of the most problematic plant invaders in 
Mediterranean-type ecosystems. In this study, we investigate the species’ invasion history by compar-
ing the genetic diversity and structure of native (Australia) and several invasive range (Brazil, Portugal, 
South Africa, Spain, and Uruguay) populations and by modelling different introduction scenarios using 
these data. We sampled 272 A. longifolia individuals – 126 from different invasive ranges and 146 from 
the native range – from 41 populations. We genotyped all individuals at four chloroplast and 12 nuclear 
microsatellite markers. From these data we calculated diversity metrics, identified chloroplast haplotypes, 
and estimated population genetic structure based on Bayesian assignment tests. We used Approximate 
Bayesian Computation (ABC) models to infer the likely introduction history into each invaded coun-
try. In Australia, population genetic structure of A. longifolia appears to be strongly shaped by the Bass 
Strait and we identified two genetic clusters largely corresponding to mainland Australian and Tasmanian 
populations. We found invasive populations to represent a mixture of these clusters. Similar levels of 
genetic diversity were present in native and invasive ranges, indicating that invasive populations did not 
go through a genetic bottleneck. Bayesian assignment tests and chloroplast haplotype frequencies further 
suggested a secondary introduction event between South Africa and Portugal. However, ABC analyses 
could not confidently identify the native source(s) of invasive populations in these two countries, probably 
due to the known high propagule pressure that accompanied these introductions. ABC analyses identified 
Tasmania as the likely source of invasive populations in Brazil and Uruguay. A definitive native source for 
Spanish populations could also not be identified. This study shows that tracing the introduction history of

A. longifolia is difficult, most likely because of the complexity associated with the extensive movement of 
the species around the world. Our findings should be considered when planning management and control 
efforts, such as biological control, in some invaded regions.

Introduction
Australian acacias (genus Acacia Mill.) are considered some of the world’s most prob-
lematic plant invaders (Richardson et al. 2011). At least 25 species are known to be 
invasive (Richardson et al. 2015; Magona et al. 2018) and are amongst some of the 
best studied taxa in invasion biology (Richardson et al. 2011). Acacia species have been 
introduced worldwide for several purposes, such as land reclamation, tannin produc-
tion and as ornamental plants (Griffin et al. 2011). These introductions frequently 
involved high propagule pressure (i.e., the number and size of introduction events), 
exemplified by invasive populations that often have high levels of genetic diversity and 
that experience no molecular inbreeding (Vicente et al. 2021).
Knowledge of the introduction history of invasive species may aid their manage-
ment, such as biological control (Jourdan et al. 2019). For example, the earleaf aca-
cia, Acacia auriculiformis, is considered highly invasive in Florida, USA (Kull et al. 
2008; Richardson and Rejmánek 2011; McCulloch et al. 2021). In its native range, the 
species shows deep phylogenomic divergence between northern Queensland and the 
Northern Territory in Australia, and Papua New Guinea (McCulloch et al. 2021). This 
deep genetic divergence is mirrored in populations of some herbivorous insects feed-
ing on A. auriculiformis, such as the specialist leaf-feeding beetle, Calomela intemerata 
(Nawaz et al. 2021). This holds important implications for the utility of this insect 
as a potential biocontrol agent for A. auriculiformis. For example, genomic analyses 
identified the Northern Territory as the source of invasive populations of the wattle in 
Florida (McCulloch et al. 2021) and, therefore, Calomela intemerata from this part of 
Australia may be particularly well-suited for biocontrol release in this invaded region.
Molecular studies have been instrumental in disentangling the introduction histo-
ries of invasive species (Le Roux 2021). For example, genetic studies allow researchers 
to trace the routes of, and estimate the propagule pressure that founded, invasions 
(Wardill et al. 2005; Pyšek et al. 2013). Invasive Australian acacias have been par-
ticularly well-studied in this regard (e.g., Thompson et al. 2012, 2015; Le Roux et al. 
2013; Ndlovu et al. 2013; Vicente et al. 2018; Hirsch et al. 2019, 2021). For instance, 
the Acacia saligna species complex (also known as Coojong) comprises three distinct 
genetic lineages (ssp. lindleyi, ssp. stolonifera, and ssp. salinga and pruinescens; Millar 
et al. 2011) with different distributions in Australia (Thompson et al. 2011). This 
species was introduced into South Africa in 1833 (Poynton 2009), Portugal in 1869

(Thompson et al. 2015), Libya and Ethiopia in 1870 (Griffin et al. 2011), and Israel 
in 1920 (Kull et al. 2011). It was also introduced into countries such as Italy and the 
USA (California), where introduction dates are unknown (Thompson et al. 2015). 
Using genetic data, Thompson et al. (2012, 2015) found that all lineages have been in-
troduced outside Australia and that extensive admixture is occurring in some invaded 
ranges. However, in South Africa a novel genetic lineage (which likely originated from 
an introgressive hybridisation event) was identified (Thompson et al. 2012). This line-
age was subsequently identified in Italy and Portugal (Thompson et al. 2015). Acacia 
pycnantha, also known as the Golden wattle, is a species native to eastern and southern 
Australian that has two recognised ecotypes, the so-called wetland and dryland forms 
(Ndlovu et al. 2013). This species was introduced into South Africa in 1865 and again 
in 1890 and is now considered highly invasive in the country (Poynton 2009). The 
species also has invasive populations in Portugal and Western Australia (Richardson 
and Rejmánek 2011; Ndlovu et al. 2013). In Australia, Le Roux et al. (2013) identi-
fied admixture between the two ecotypes, probably because of the extensive movement 
of seeds/plants for restoration. Invasive populations in South Africa have similar levels 
of genetic diversity and admixture to native range populations (Le Roux et al. 2013).
Acacia longifolia (Andrews) Willd. is native to south-eastern Australia and Tasma-
nia, with two formally described subspecies: A. l. ssp. longifolia and A. l. ssp. sophorae 
(Flora of Australia Volume 11B, Mimosaceae, Acacia part 2 2001). These subspecies 
are distinguished by phyllode shape, size and colour, and seed pod shape. They also 
have slightly different, but mostly overlapping, distributions in Australia (Flora of Aus-
tralia Volume 11B, Mimosaceae, Acacia part 2 2001). This species has been introduced 
into several countries as an ornamental tree and for coastal dune stabilisation and is 
now considered one of the worst plant invaders in many Mediterranean regions. Acacia 
longifolia was initially introduced into South Africa in 1827. Subsequent introductions 
occurred in 1845 (from Australia) and between 1895 and 1908 (secondarily from 
Paris and California, and the Botanical Gardens of Adelaide; Poynton 2009). In 1984, 
A. longifolia was considered the second most impactful invader of the country’s hyper-
diverse fynbos biome (Macdonald and Jarman 1984; Dennill 1987). Between 1982 
and 1983, the Australian gall-forming wasp, Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae, was intro-
duced from Australia to control the species (Dennill 1985, 1987; Neser 1985). This 
biocontrol agent is considered highly successful (Janion-Scheepers and Griffiths 2020).
In Portugal, specimens of A. longifolia were recorded in the catalogue of the Uni-
versity of Coimbra’s Botanical Gardens in 1878 (Henriques 1879). However, the first 
official introduction record of the species into Portugal likely dates to 1897 (Fernandes 
2008; Carruthers et al. 2011; Kull et al. 2011). Irrespective of when the species was 
introduced, the origins of these introduction(s) remain unknown. The species was used 
by forestry services in several coastal afforestation projects over the years. A few exam-
ples are the dunes in São Jacinto (1888–1929; Marchante 2011), Costa da Caparica 
(1906; Lourenço 2009), Quiaios-Mira (1924 and 1948; Rei 1925; Marchante 2001, 
2011), and Vila Nova de Milfontes [late 1960s/early 1970s; Miguel Prado, personal 
communication, but see Vicente (2016); Vicente et al. (2018)]. A molecular study

including three invasive populations from Portugal found similar genetic diversity and 
very low differentiation among them, which led to the hypothesis that the introduc-
tion of the species into Portugal involved a single seed source that was used to estab-
lish nursery stock, and these plants were then disseminated for afforestation projects 
(Vicente et al. 2018). However, the introduction records mentioned above suggest a 
more complex introduction history of the species into Portugal. The invasion success 
of A. longifolia in Portugal has led to the biological control release of Trichilogaster 
acaciaelongifoliae, imported from South Africa (Marchante et al. 2011). The wasp has 
successfully established along the Portuguese coast (López-Núñez et al. 2021).
In South America the introduction of A. longifolia occurred much more recently, in 
mid-20th century, into southern Brazil (Rico-Arce 2007; Zenni and Ziller 2011), Uru-
guay (Boelcke 1946; Rico-Arce 2007) and Argentina (Boelcke 1946; Celsi 2016). In 
Uruguay the first record for this species dates to 1946 (Boelcke 1946), and in Brazil the 
first official record of the species is from 1979 in Santa Catarina (Burkart 1979). There 
are also several observational records for the species in other states of Brazil, Argen-
tina, and Uruguay (e.g., Base de dados de espécies exóticas invasoras do Brasil, http://
bd.institutohorus.org.br; Tropicos.org, http://www.tropicos.org/Name/13024183). 
No biological control agents have been released into South America and no informa-
tion is available on the origins of A. longifolia introductions to the continent.
Here we compare the population genetic diversity and structure of native and 
globally invasive populations of A. longifolia. We also aim to infer the introduction 
histories of the species into Brazil, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, and Uruguay using 
Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) modelling. Based on available historical 
records and the results from molecular studies of invasive acacias mentioned above, 
we hypothesised that the genetic diversity in invasive populations will be comparable 
to that of Australian populations, but with low population genetic structure. Regard-
ing introduction scenarios, we hypothesised that Portuguese A. longifolia populations 
originated from a single introduction event from Australia, whereas in South Africa, 
we expected our modelling results to support the known multiple and independent 
introductions of the species into the country (Poynton 2009). We thus hypothesised 
that this invasion would be characterised by high levels of genetic admixture. We had 
no clear prediction for the introduction history of A. longifolia in South America given 
the scarcity of historical information for the region.
Methods
Collection of Plant Material and DNA Extraction
Phyllodes of Acacia longifolia were collected from individual plants in several invasive 
[Portugal, POR; Spain – Galicia, ESP; South Africa, RSA; Brazil, BRA (Vicente et al. 
2020); and Uruguay, URU] and native (mainland southeast Australia, AUS; and Tasma-
nia, TAS) range populations. Within each country we sampled more than one popula-

tion where possible (see Table 1). In Portugal, individuals from Vila Nova de Milfontes 
(VNMF), Pinheiro da Cruz (PC) and two individuals from Osso da Baleia (included 
in the Mira population) were previously sampled by Vicente et al. (2018). In Australia, 
additional material was obtained from seedlings grown from seeds acquired from local 
nurseries. In total, 272 individuals were included in our analyses (Table 1, Fig. 1A), 126 
from invaded ranges (Table 1A, Fig. 1B–D) and 146 from Australia (Table 1B, Fig. 2).
DNA was extracted using the method of Doyle and Doyle (1987), as modified by 
Weising et al. (1994) and adapted for A. longifolia by Vicente et al. (2018). DNA was 
quantified using spectrophotometry.
Microsatellite amplification and genotyping
Ten chloroplast microsatellite loci (cpSSRs; ccmp1-10) described by Weising and 
Gardner (1999) were tested for cross-amplification in A. longifolia (Suppl. material 1: 
table S1). For these cross-amplification tests, we first used the PCR conditions de-
scribed by Weising and Gardner (1999) and, when needed, adjusted MgCl2 concen-
trations between 1.5 mM to 2.5 mM and annealing temperatures between 50 °C to 
52 °C to optimise amplifications of individual loci. Loci were selected based on visu-
alisation of PCR products on 2% agarose gels. Four loci (ccmp3, 4, 5 and 7) consist-
ently yielded high quality amplicons and were selected for amplification in all samples. 
Details of PCR primers can be found in Suppl. material 1: table S2. For cpSSRs each 
15 μL reaction contained 20ng DNA, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTP mix (Promega, 
USA), 0.5 μM fluorescently labelled (with either 6-FAM or HEX) forward primer and 
0.5 μM reverse primer (STAB Vida, Portugal), 1 U of GoTaq Flexi DNA polymerase 
and 1× colourless GoTaq Flexi buffer (Promega, USA). The following thermal cycle 
was used: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 1 min at 
94 °C, 1 min at 52 °C and 1 min at 72 °C, with a final extension period of 8 min at 
72 °C. As a routine procedure, each reaction included a negative control that did not 
include DNA and at least 10% of repeated samples that were run in a 2% agarose gel 
to confirm amplification before fragment analysis.
We searched the literature for studies that have developed nuclear microsatellites 
(nSSRs) in Acacia species. We also tested primers that we designed for A. cyclops (un-
published data). This led to a total of 32 primer pairs that were screened for cross-
amplification in A. longifolia (Suppl. material 1: table S1). For optimisation, MgCl2 
concentrations were varied between 1.5 mM and 2.5 mM, annealing temperature be-
tween 52 °C and 60 °C, extension times between 15s and 30s, and primer concentra-
tions between 0.1 μM and 0.2 μM. Loci were selected based on visualisation of PCR 
amplification products on 2% agarose gels. Eleven nSSR loci were retained for amplifi-
cation in our samples. Primers for locus DCLOC (Roberts et al. 2013) were previously 
optimised for analysis in A. longifolia by Vicente et al. (2018) and were also included 
in this study. Genotyping data for this locus for samples from Vila Nova de Milfontes 
(VNMF), Pinheiro da Cruz (PC) and two samples from Osso da Baleia (included in 
the Mira population) were obtained from Vicente et al. (2018) and incorporated into

Vida, Portugal), 1 U of GoTaq Flexi DNA polymerase and 1× colourless GoTaq Flexi 
buffer (Promega, USA). The PCR cycle consisted of an initial denaturation at 95 °C 
for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 30 sec at 94 °C, 1 min at the annealing temperature 
optimised for each primer pair (Suppl. material 1: table S2), and 30 sec at 72 °C, with 
a final extension period of 7 min at 72 °C. For the two primer pairs, Division/Bell 
and The/Wall, extension time was reduced to 15 s. Positive and negative controls were 
included in each reaction, as explained above. Fragments for all loci were separated on 
an Applied Biosystems 3100 Series System with the Dye Set DS-30 (internal standard 
ROX) by STAB Vida (Portugal) and scored using Peak Scanner in the ThermoFisher 
AppConnect online software portal (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA).
Population genetic diversity and structure
Haplotypes were identified based on the combination of alleles across all cpSSR loci/
individual (see Results section). The number of different alleles (Na), number of ef-
fective alleles (Ne), Shannon’s Information Index (I), and haplotype diversity (h) were 
calculated using GenAlEx v6.5 (Peakall and Smouse 2006, 2012). The Network v10.2 
software (www.fluxus-engineering.com) was used to draw a median-joining (MJ; Ban-
delt et al. 1999) haplotype network.

Micro-Checker v2.2 (Van Oosterhout et al. 2004) was used to check for scor-
ing errors and large allele dropouts in our nSSR genotype dataset. This software was 
also used to generate a dataset that has been corrected for null alleles, using the 
Oosterhout algorithm with 95% confidence intervals (Van Oosterhout et al. 2004). 
Expected heterozygosity (HE), observed heterozygosity (HO), allelic richness (Ar), and 
inbreeding coefficients (FIS) were calculated for the corrected and uncorrected geno-
type datasets using the diveRsity R package (Keenan et al. 2013). These metrics were 
compared between datasets using the independent 2-group Mann-Whitney U test 
in R environment (R Core Team 2016) to check if the presence of null alleles af-
fected our results. The mean frequency of null alleles across all loci and populations 
was calculated with the FreeNA software (Chapuis and Estoup 2007), as well as the 
ENA-corrected (i.e., excluding null alleles; ENA method, Chapuis and Estoup 2007) 
and uncorrected global (i.e., at each locus and population) and pairwise population 
fixation indices (FST). To further check for the effects of null alleles on our analyses, 
statistical differences between the ENA-corrected and uncorrected global and pair-
wise FST values were tested using the independent 2-group Mann-Whitney U test 
in R environment (R Core Team 2016). Since null alleles had an overall low mean 
frequency and did not significantly affect any of the calculated metrics (see Results), 
no correction for null alleles was applied and all further analyses were performed us-
ing the uncorrected nSSR genotype dataset. Allele frequency departures from Hardy-
Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) for all loci were tested using GenAlEx v6.5 (Peakall 
and Smouse 2006, 2012).
The four descriptive population diversity metrics mentioned above (HE, HO, Ar, 
and FIS) were compared among countries using a Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test in R 
environment (R Core Team 2016). In this analysis, individuals from Spain were ex-
cluded as only two populations were sampled in this country. Instead, the analysis was 
repeated by grouping the samples from Spain with the ones from Portugal (i.e., Iberian 
Peninsula; IBP).
Bayesian assignment tests were performed using the STRUCTURE v2.3.4 pro-
gram (Pritchard et al. 2000) to investigate the genetic structure of the native and 
invasive A. longifolia populations. An admixture model with correlated allele frequen-
cies was used to test for the number of genetic clusters (K), ranging from 1 to 15, 
with 100,000 burn-in iterations, 250,000 Markov Chain Monte Carlo repetitions 
(MCMC), and 15 iterations per K value. We then performed a hierarchical analysis by 
removing samples belonging to the smallest genetic cluster identified by this analysis 
(13 samples belonging to Portugal and South Africa; see Results) to infer structure 
among the remaining populations. We repeated this analysis with the same condi-
tions as above, but with K ranging from 1 to 10. For all STRUCTURE analyses the 
optimum number of genetic clusters was evaluated in STRUCTURE HARVESTER 
web v0.6.94 (Earl and vonHoldt 2012) by applying the delta K method of Evanno et 
al. (2005) and also analysing the likelihood distributions [LnP(K)]. Graphical visu-
alisations of these results were obtained using the CLUMPAK server main pipeline 
(Kopelman et al. 2015).
Sara Vicente et al.  /  NeoBiota 82: 89–117 (2023)

To better understand population structure within the native range, we also ran 
a separate STRUCTURE analysis that included data from native range individuals 
only, with K ranging from 1 to 10, implementing an admixture model with correlated 
allele frequencies using 10,000 burn-in iterations, 50,000 MCMC repetitions, and 
10 iterations per K value. The optimum number of genetic clusters and the graphical 
visualisation of the results were obtained as described above. This analysis identified 
K = 2 as the optimum number of genetic clusters, with one cluster predominantly cor-
responding to mainland Australia and the other predominantly to Tasmanian popu-
lations (see Results). To check for population genetic substructure within these two 
identified clusters, ancestry coefficients for each individual were averaged by cluster 
over the 10 iterations for K = 2, and individuals having a minimum ancestry coefficient 
cut-off value of 0.7 for their corresponding cluster were selected for further cluster-
specific (i.e., mainland Australia or Tasmania) analyses. We used the same parameters 
described above to identify the optimum number of genetic clusters and to graphi-
cally visualise these. We also tested for Isolation by Distance (IBD) by performing a 
Mantel test with 9,999 permutations using the ade4 R package (Dray et al. 2022) by 
comparing the linearised pairwise FST values matrix (i.e., FST/1-FST) with the geographi-
cal distance matrix obtained with the Geographic Distance Matrix Generator v1.2.3 
software (Ersts 2022). We compared the mean pairwise FST values among populations 
within mainland Australia, populations within Tasmania, and populations from main-
land Australia vs Tasmania using a Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test followed by a post-hoc 
independent 2-group Mann-Whitney U test in R environment (R Core Team 2016).
Inference of invasion sources
Approximate Bayesian Computations (ABC) were performed in the DIYABC v2.1.0 
software (Cornuet et al. 2014) to test different invasion scenarios for each invaded 
country separately. In these analyses, we took the two major genetic clusters in the 
native range identified by the STRUCTURE analysis (see Results) into consideration, 
i.e., populations from mainland Australia (AUS) and Tasmania (TAS), while invaded 
populations that were pooled by country. All tested scenarios assumed that the AUS 
and TAS populations diverged from a native ancestral unsampled population, with the 
following variations: 1) the invasive population originated from the AUS populations; 
2) the invasive population originated from the TAS populations; 3) the invasive pop-
ulation originated from an admixed unsampled population resulting from multiple 
introductions which originated from both AUS and TAS populations; 4) the invasive 
population originated from multiple introductions (“ghost” unsampled populations) 
originating from AUS populations; 5) the invasive population originated from multi-
ple introductions (“ghost” unsampled populations) originating from TAS populations; 
and 6) the invasive population originated from an unknown native population which is 
related to the AUS and TAS genetic lineages (see Fig. 3). We ran 3 x 106 simulations for 
each scenario for each invaded country. We did not consider any genetic bottlenecks 
in these scenarios, as we found no evidence for their existence (see Results section).

The summary statistics selected for the models were the following: mean number of 
alleles, mean genetic diversity, mean allele size variance, mean M index, fixation index 
(FST), mean index of classification, shared allele distance and δμ2 genetic distance. The 
description of the parameters, their prior distributions, and parameter rules are pro-
vided in Suppl. material 1: tables S3–S5. The priors for time of invasion (tINV) varied 
between countries according to the latest year of sample collection and the year of first 
introduction reported in historical records and literature (see Introduction for details), 
assuming a generation time of 2–3 years (Maslin and McDonald 2004; Vicente et al. 
2021). For the purposes of this analysis, since there is no available information on a 
specific introduction year into Spain (Galicia), the year of introduction into Portugal 
was assumed to coincide with the introduction of A. longifolia into Spain (see Intro-
duction for details). This allowed an estimation of the maximum possible number of 
generations that A. longifolia has been present in each invaded country. The posterior 
probabilities of each scenario were calculated using a logistic approach on the 1% 
simulated datasets that were closest to the observed dataset. For the scenario(s) with 
the highest probability for each country, the posterior distribution of parameters was 
estimated using a logit transformation on the 1% simulated datasets that were closest 
to the observed dataset. The precision of these parameters was assessed using the “bias 
and precision” option on 500 test datasets to estimate the relative median absolute 
deviation (RMedAD) and means of the median relative bias (MedRB). The adequacy 
of the chosen scenario(s) was assessed using the “model checking” option by simulat-

ing 1000 datasets using a logit transformation of parameters, with a different set of 
summary statistics to avoid overestimating the fit of the model. The chosen statistics 
were the mean number of alleles, mean genetic diversity, mean allele size variance, and 
δμ2 genetic distance. Type I and Type II errors were also computed for the scenarios(s) 
with the highest posterior probability using the “confidence in scenario choice” option 
using a logistic regression and simulating 100 test datasets.
Due to the identification of a cluster connecting South Africa and Portugal (see 
Results section), we also tested 6 scenarios with data from these two countries, that 
correspond to scenarios 1, 2 and 6 described above with and without a bridgehead 
between South Africa and Portugal. We ran simulations and “model checking” analyses 
as described above for non-bridgehead scenarios.

Dataset characteristics
We identified between two and three alleles per cpSSR locus (mean 2.5), ranging be-
tween 93–154 bp in size. We identified between two and nine alleles per nSSR locus 
(mean 5.08), ranging between 81 bp to 328 bp in size. Scoring errors due to stuttering 
were found for locus C51M0 (Mira population, POR; Table 1A) and locus AH3-1 
(Seven Mile beach population, TAS; Table 1B). All loci showed departures from Har-
dy-Weinberg equilibrium, and within populations some were monomorphic. How-
ever, mean null allele frequency was low in our dataset (mean = 0.027; SD = 0.073) 
and ENA-corrected and uncorrected FST values were not significantly different between 
null allele-corrected and uncorrected datasets for both global and pairwise estimates 
(Mann-Whitney U test p > 0.5; Suppl. material 1: fig. S1). Similarly, population diver-
sity metrics (HE, HO, Ar, and FIS) were not significantly different between the corrected 
and uncorrected datasets (Mann-Whitney U test p > 0.5; Suppl. material 1: fig. S2). 
Therefore, null allele corrections were not considered in all further nSSR analyses.
Population genetic diversity and structure
Our cpSSR data identified eight unique haplotypes (hereafter haplotypes A–H; 
Fig. 4A). Haplotype E was the most dominant in invasive ranges, while haplotype 
D was the most frequent one in the native range. Haplotypes B, C and G only oc-
curred in the native range. Portugal and South Africa shared one haplotype (A), and 
also had a unique haplotype each (F and H, respectively). Our network analysis found 
that haplotypes B, D and E were closely related to most other haplotypes (Fig. 4B). 
The number of different alleles (Na) ranged from 1 (BRA and ESP) to 2.25 (RSA; Ta-
ble 2), while the number of effective alleles (Ne) ranged from 1 to 1.659 (similar to Na; 
Table 2). In invaded countries, South African populations had the highest haplotype 
diversity (h = 0.407, Table 2), while Spanish and Brazilian populations had a single

101
haplotype (Table 2). Haplotype diversity in Australian populations ranged between 
0.06 (TAS) to 0.186 (AUS; Table 2). Haplotype B was only found in South Australia 
(SA; Beachport population, Table 1B) while haplotype G occurred only in Tasmania 
(TAS; St. Helens Conservation Area population, Table 1B). Haplotype E was found in 
New South Wales (NSW; Clovelly and Torrington populations, Table 1B) and in one 
population in eastern Tasmania (St. Helens Conservation Area population). Haplotype 
C was predominantly restricted to mainland Australia, while haplotype D was wide-
spread across the native range.
For invasive populations, and for nSSRs, mean expected heterozygosity (HE) 
ranged from 0.29 (ESP) to 0.33 (POR), while mean observed heterozygosity (HO) 
ranged from 0.33 (RSA) to 0.40 (BRA), mean allelic richness (Ar) ranged from 1.74 
(ESP) to 1.97 (POR), and mean inbreeding coefficient (FIS) ranged from -0.146 (RSA) 
to -0.317 (BRA; Table 3). In the native range, mean HE ranged from 0.25 (AUS) to 
0.27 (TAS), while mean HO ranged from 0.31 (TAS) to 0.32 (AUS), mean Ar ranged 
from 1.73 (AUS) to 1.77 (TAS), and mean FIS ranged from -0.196 (TAS) to -0.303

(AUS; Table 3). Diversity metric comparisons (excluding Spanish populations due to 
low population numbers) found similar levels of genetic diversity and lack of inbreed-
ing between native and different invasive ranges (Kruskal-Wallis test p > 0.05 for all di-
versity metrics; Fig. 5). Similar results were obtained when these analyses were repeated 
with individuals from Spain and Portugal lumped together as Iberian Peninsula (IBP; 
Suppl. material 1: fig. S3).
Our initial STRUCTURE analysis based on all nSSR data identified two genetic 
clusters (Suppl. material 1: fig. S4A, B), one that included individuals from Portugal 
(Mira population) and South Africa (Clarkson and Sedgefield populations) and another 
that included all other populations (Fig. 6A). STRUCTURE analysis of the latter cluster 
(i.e., hierarchical analysis) revealed two further genetic subclusters (Suppl. material 1: 
fig. S4C, D). In this second analysis, native range populations separated in two genetic 
clusters roughly corresponding to those from mainland Australian (AUS) and Tasmania 
(TAS), while populations from the invaded ranges were admixtures of these two genetic 
clusters (Fig. 6B, and see Suppl. material 1: fig. S5 for bar plots of K = 3 – 6).
Analysis of the native range-only data also identified two genetic clusters (Suppl. 
material 1: fig. S6), corresponding to mainland Australia and Tasmania (Fig. 7A). We

tion indices among populations within mainland Australia and within Tasmania to be 
significantly lower than the fixation indices among populations from mainland Aus-
tralia and Tasmania (Fig. 8, Kruskal-Wallis test χ2 = 12.848, p = 0.002, followed by a

post-hoc Mann-Whitney U test), further supporting the STRUCTURE assignment 
of individuals to two genetic clusters corresponding to mainland Australia and Tas-
mania. However, higher values of K suggested that substructure existed within these 
two clusters (Suppl. material 1: fig. S7). Hierarchical STRUCTURE analyses revealed 
four clusters within mainland Australia and two clusters within Tasmania (Fig. 7B, C, 
respectively; Suppl. material 1: fig. S8A, B and C, D, respectively). Within mainland 
Australia, the population from Beachport appears to be distinct from all other popula-
tions (Fig. 7B; it also has a unique cpSSR haplotype B, Fig. 4), while all other popula-
tions show equal and symmetrical levels of admixture (i.e., being panmictic; also visible 
for other higher K values, Suppl. material 1: fig. S9). Within Tasmania, the Bridport, 
Three Sisters National Park, and Stanley populations seem to be genetically distinct 
from all other populations (Fig. 7C), with the Three Sisters National Park population 
being the most distinct (Suppl. material 1: fig. S10, K = 6). Bar plots for higher values 
of K are presented in the Suppl. material 1 (Suppl. material 1: figs S9, S10).

Inference of invasion sources
A similar introduction scenario was inferred for South Africa and Portugal, with the 
origin of invasive populations being an unknown population related to both the AUS 
and TAS genetic lineages (i.e., scenario 6, Fig. 3). This scenario had very high prob-
ability for both countries (p = 0.997, 95% CI = 0.995–0.998, and p = 0.928, 95% CI 
= 0.906–0.95, respectively; Suppl. material 1: fig. S11). Similar introduction scenarios 
were identified for Brazil and Uruguay: single or multiple introductions from Tasma-
nia, i.e., scenarios 2 and 5, respectively (Fig. 3). Statistical support for these scenarios 
was lower for Brazil (scenario 2: p = 0.417, 95% CI = 0.391–0.443; scenario 5: p = 
0.425, 95% CI = 0.399–0.451; Suppl. material 1: fig. S11) and Uruguay (scenario 2: 
p = 0.403, 95% CI = 0.378–0.429; scenario 5: p = 0.418, 95% CI = 0.392–0.444; 
Suppl. material 1: fig. S11) compared with the support for the most likely scenarios 
for Portugal and South Africa. Our ABC analysis for Spain was inconclusive, thus any 
discussion (see below) regarding these populations does not rely on this result.
Based on the scenarios with highest posterior probability for each invaded country, 
several parameters such as effective population size, time of events (e.g., introductions), 
admixture, and mutation rates were computed (Suppl. material 1: table S3). The mean 
time since first introduction of A. longifolia into South Africa and Portugal was 53.4 
and 34.1 generations, respectively (Suppl. material 1: table S4). The mean time since 
first introduction ranged from 18.6 to 29.6 generations for Uruguay and from 13.8 
to 16.3 generations for Brazil, depending on the scenario (2 or 5; Suppl. material 1: 
table S5). Bias values (i.e., RMedAD and MedRB) indicated that our model estimates 
are plausible (Suppl. material 1: tables S4, S5). Low Type I and Type II errors were 
inferred for both the Portuguese and South African scenarios (ranging from 0.02 to 
0.12; Suppl. material 1: table S6). Conversely, the scenarios for Brazil and Uruguay 
showed higher Type I and Type II errors (ranging from 0.45 to 0.60; Suppl. material 1: 
table S6), but their posterior probabilities were low (compared with the scenario with 
highest probability for Portugal and South Africa). Results for the adequacy of the 
scenarios (i.e., “model checking”, Suppl. material 1: table S7) showed that all high pos-
terior probability scenarios had a slight deviation between the observed and simulated 
mean allelic size variance statistic, and in some cases also the mean genetic distance, 
but overall indicate that these scenarios sufficiently explained the observed data.
Results from the bridgehead scenario analysis (Suppl. material 1: fig. S12) showed 
that scenario 5 had the highest posterior probability (p = 0.716, 95% CI = 0.617–
0.818). This scenario (Suppl. material 1: fig. S13) represents independent introduc-
tions of A. longifolia into South Africa and Portugal from an unknown native source 
that is related to both the AUS and TAS genetic lineages, thus not supporting a bridge-
head introduction event between these two countries. The “model checking” analysis 
(Suppl. material 1: table S8) showed many deviations between the observed and simu-
lated values of several summary statistics, indicating that this scenario does not explain 
our data better than those tested above.
Invasion genetics of Acacia longifolia

Discussion
Our results suggest a complex introduction history of A. longifolia around the world 
during the 19th and 20th centuries. We found support for our initial hypothesis that 
invasive populations have high genetic diversity and low population structure. This 
agrees with the known history of multiple introductions, often of large propagule sizes, 
of the species into many parts of the world (Kull et al. 2007, 2008, 2011; Carruthers et 
al. 2011). Multiple introductions, especially when originating from multiple sources, 
hamper inferences of the native sources of invasive populations, even when historical 
records are available. For example, for Portugal, we were unable to identify the native 
source(s) of introduction and found evidence of multiple introductions, thus refuting 
the single introduction hypothesis from a previous study (Vicente et al. 2018). Simi-
larly, we were unable to draw any conclusions on the sources of invasive A. longifolia 
in Galicia (Spain), likely due to the low number of populations and individuals we 
sampled in the country. Regarding South Africa, as expected, we were not able to 
identify the native source of the invasion. On the other hand, we were able to identify 
Tasmania as the likely native source of invasive populations in South America. Below 
we discuss how our limited sampling in Victoria and South Australia (one population 
in each state) and lack of samples from Queensland may have impacted our inferences 
of the introduction histories of A. longifolia to different parts of the world.
We identified population structure in Australian A. longifolia, with populations 
from mainland Australia and Tasmania corresponding to two distinct genetic clusters 
(Figs 6, 7A). Most invasive populations appeared to be admixtures between these two 
clusters, providing support for multiple introductions. One possible explanation for 
the existence of the two genetic clusters in Australia is the Bass Strait that separates 
Tasmania from the mainland, and thus acts as a strong barrier to gene flow as has 
been observed for A. dealbata (Hirsch et al. 2017, 2018) and other Australian natives 
such as Eucalyptus regnans (Nevill et al. 2010) and Tasmannia lanceolata (Worth et al. 
2010). We also identified substructure within the mainland Australia and Tasmania 
clusters. Within mainland Australia, the Beachport population is genetically distinct 
from all others (Fig. 7B), and this result is also corroborated by the cpSSR data. This 
population is from South Australia and corresponds to the most western sampling site 
in our analyses, and thus these results might be due to disjunct sampling. Future work 
should include populations sampled throughout this state to fully understand the spe-
cies’ population structure in Australia. Regarding the Tasmanian cluster, the Bridport, 
Three Sisters National Park, and Stanley populations were found to be genetically dis-
tinct from all others (Fig. 7C). Interestingly, these are the only three sampled Tasma-
nian populations in close proximity to the Bass Strait, and these results can possibly 
suggest some level of gene flow among these populations and those from mainland 
Australia close to the Bass Strait. However, only one sampled population in mainland 
Australia is situated within this region (Curdievale, Victoria), thus further sampling is 
required to clarify these genetic relationships.

While we identified substructure within mainland Australia and Tasmania, we 
used the two overall genetic clusters as putative source areas in our ABC modelling for 
several reasons. First, the overall clustering of Australian populations into two genetic 
clusters was well supported by our isolation by distance (IBD) analyses and regional 
comparisons of fixation indices (Fig. 8). Second, fine-scale source inferences using hi-
erarchical clusters would be more affected by unsampled “ghost” populations (which 
we included in our modelling scenarios, Fig. 3) than inferences based on broadscale 
regional genetic clusters. Our limited sampling in several Australian states makes the 
issues associated with modelling fine-scale invasion sources even more problematic. 
Lastly, co-evolutionary diversification between the host plants and prospective biocon-
trol agents is generally evident at broader, rather than narrow, geographic scales (e.g., 
Goolsby et al. 2006). The earleaf wattle example we discussed earlier provides a case in 
point (see Introduction). Co-diversification between this wattle and its specialist leaf-
feeding beetle, Calomela intemerata, has been identified over broad geographic scales 
(Nawaz et al. 2021). Therefore, knowledge of the broadscale native range source(s) of 
invasive populations can play an important role in matching potential biological con-
trol agent biotypes with invasive host plant lineages.
We also found evidence for a unique genetic cluster shared between Portugal and 
South Africa. Invasive populations in these two countries also shared one cpSSR haplo-
type (Fig. 4). These findings suggest a possible secondary introduction event or bridge-
head, likely from South Africa into Portugal based on historical occurrence records of 
the species in both countries (Rei 1925; Lourenço 2009; Poynton 2009; Marchante 
2011; Vicente 2016; Vicente et al. 2018). Our ABC modelling did not support this 
scenario and this aspect of the introduction history of A. longifolia warrants further in-
vestigation. Overall, globally invasive populations do not appear to have gone through 
genetic bottlenecks upon introduction, a common feature of invasive acacia popula-
tions (Vicente et al. 2021).
While we could not infer introduction histories for all invaded regions with high 
levels of confidence, we do provide evidence that these likely differed among different 
parts of the world. For instance, we found higher cpSSR haplotype diversity in South 
Africa and Portugal compared with South America, probably because these two coun-
tries have been invaded for longer or, more likely, their introductions had much higher 
propagule pressure than to those into South America. South Africa had the highest 
haplotype diversity (higher than in the native range populations we sampled), while 
Spain and Brazil had the lowest. These findings agree with historical records indicating 
that wattle seeds, including those of A. longifolia, were often imported into South Afri-
ca from several locations, both from within and outside Australia (Poynton 2009). Our 
finding that South African populations harbour genetic diversity levels similar to those 
in native range populations is therefore unsurprising. Taken together, this corroborates 
our Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) modelling inferences, which failed 
to identify the native source of South African populations based on the scenarios we 
analysed. Similar findings have been made for other invasive acacias with complicated 
introduction histories characterised by multiple introductions of high propagule sizes

from diverse sources (e.g., A. dealbata; Hirsch et al. 2019, 2021). In our case, it is also 
possible that the “ghost” sources of South African invasions are areas in Victoria, South 
Australia, or Queensland, from where we had limited or no samples, and this limita-
tion may also be the reason for the identification of divergent chloroplast haplotypes 
in invaded areas (e.g., haplotypes A and H in South Africa, Fig. 4).
The introduction history of A. longifolia in Portugal, as for South Africa, is likely 
characterised by multiple and genetically diverse introduction events. Historical re-
cords indicate that various Acacia species were planted along the Portuguese coast at 
different times (e.g., Rei 1925; Lourenço 2009; Marchante 2011; Marchante et al. 
2011; Vicente 2016; Vicente et al. 2018). A previous genetic study hypothesised that 
the same seed allotment was used to establish nursery stock from which plants were 
sourced for plantings along the Portuguese coast (Vicente et al. 2018). Yet, genetic 
diversity of Portuguese populations is similar to that in South African and Austral-
ian populations, suggesting that multiple introductions from different origins likely 
established invasive populations in Portugal. A similar introduction history was re-
cently described for A. dealbata into Portugal (Hirsch et al. 2021). Again, the sources 
of Portuguese A. longifolia invasions may include native range areas in Victoria, South 
Australia, or Queensland, from where we had limited or no samples.
For Brazil and Uruguay our ABC analyses indicated that the most likely origin of 
introduction is Tasmania, either as single or multiple introduction events. Historical 
records from these countries are scarce but considering that the genetic diversity of 
these populations is similar to that found in South African, Portuguese and Australian 
populations, multiple introductions seem likely. We could not conclusively infer the 
source(s) of Spanish A. longifolia populations, mostly likely because of the low number 
of plants we sampled in this country. However, we speculate that these plants were 
introduced in similar fashion to that of Portugal.
Conclusion
Our work shows that the origins of A. longifolia introductions around the world are 
hard to trace, likely because of the extensive historical efforts to introduce the species 
for dune ‘restoration’ and as an ornamental plant (Kull et al. 2011). The similar levels 
of genetic diversity among native and invasive ranges are illustrative of this. Multi-
ple introduction events of large size (i.e., high propagule pressure) will not only help 
introduced population to overcome demographic and stochastic impacts associated 
with small populations sizes but will also provide high adaptive capacity, afforded by 
high genetic diversity, to these populations. Our results showing extensive admixture 
between native range genetic clusters also suggest that exploration for new biocon-
trol agents can be done throughout the native range of A. longifolia as no ‘pure’ ge-
netic lineages are invasive. Moreover, the success of existing biocontrol agents such as 
Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae in places such as South Africa is likely to be replicated 
in other invaded regions. ‘Piggy-backing’ on the biocontrol programs of countries such

as South Africa may substantially shorten the amount of time needed to implement 
programs in other parts of the world, as was the case for the introduction of T. acaciae-
longifoliae into Portugal (e.g., Marchante et al. 2011; López-Núñez et al. 2021).

Data type: Figures and tables
Explanation note: Comparison of the A) global fixation indices over all loci and pop-
ulations of Acacia longifolia, and B) pairwise fixation indices, with and without 
the ENA correction (Chapuis and Estoup 2007). Comparisons of A) expected 
heterozygosity, B) observed heterozygosity, C) allelic richness, and D) inbreeding 
coefficent, using uncorrected and null allele-corrected datasets (Micro-Checker 
v2.2; Van Oosterhout et al. 2004). Box plots showing comparisons of expected 
heterozygosity (A), observed heterozygosity (B), allelic richness (C) and inbreeding 
coefficient (D) among Acacia longifolia populations from invaded countries (with 
populations from Portugal and Spain combined as Iberian Peninsula, IBP) and the 
two native range clusters identified by STRUCTURE analysis. Likelihood distri-
bution [LnP(K)] and Delta K plots (Evanno method; Evanno et al. 2005) from 
STRUCTURE HARVESTER analysis for A-B) the complete dataset, and C-D) 
further analysis of the largest cluster (indicated in blue in Fig. 6A in the main text) 
identified in the analysis of the complete dataset (hierarchical analysis), respectively. 
STRUCTURE bar plots for K = 3 – 6 from the hierarchical analysis of the largest 
cluster from analysis of the complete dataset (indicated in blue in Fig. 6A in the 
main text). Results from the STRUCTURE HARVESTER analysis of the native 
range dataset. STRUCTURE bar plots for K = 3 – 6 from the analysis of the na-
tive range data only. Likelihood distribution [LnP(K)] and Delta K plots (Evanno 
method; Evanno et al. 2005) from STRUCTURE HARVESTER analysis for A-B) 
mainland Australia data, and C-D) Tasmania data, respectively. STRUCTURE bar 
plots for K = 2 – 6 (except K = 4) from the analysis of the mainland Australia data 
only. STRUCTURE bar plots for K = 3 – 6 from the analysis of the Tasmania data

only. Posterior probabilities of the six tested scenarios by invaded country. Details 
of microsatellite primers tested for cross-amplification in Acacia longifolia. Primers 
selected for cpSSRs and SSRs analyses and their corresponding repeat motifs, iden-
tified alleles, fluorescent dye labels used, PCR conditions (annealing temperature 
and concentration of magnesium chloride). Descriptions of parameters included in 
the ABC analyses. Prior and posterior values of parameters for Scenario 6 of ABC 
analyses, selected as the best scenario for Portugal (POR) and South Africa (RSA). 
Prior and posterior values of parameters for A) Scenario 2 and B) Scenario 5 of 
ABC analyses, selected as the best scenarios for Brazil (BRA) and Uruguay (URU). 
Type I and Type II errors for the chosen scenarios of each invaded country in ABC 
analyses. Results of the “model checking” analysis for the best scenarios selected by 
country in ABC analyses. Posterior probabilities of the six bridgehead tested sce-
narios between RSA and POR (600 000 simulations in total). DIYABC drawing of 
scenario 5, which had the higher posterior probability of the six bridgehead tested 
scenarios between RSA and POR (p = 0.7161, 95% CI = 0.6165-0.8157). Results 
of the “model checking” analysis for the best bridgehead scenarios selected (scenario 
5) in ABC analyses.
