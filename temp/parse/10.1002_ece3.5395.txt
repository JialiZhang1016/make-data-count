1 | INTRODUCTION
Migration is a ubiquitous phenomenon that has evolved as an ad‐
aptation to seasonally changing environments (Newton, 2008). 
But within the same species, or even population, we often observe 
tremendous variation in specific migration features (Chapman, 
Brönmark, Nilsson, & Hansson, 2011; Flack et al., 2016). This may 
be the outcome of trade‐offs between the costs and benefits of 
different migration strategies, leading to differences in individual 
fitness, and subsequently influencing demographic dynamics (Lok, 
Overdijk, & Piersma, 2015; Palacín, Alonso, Martín, & Alonso, 
2017). Life in the Anthropocene is challenging many ancient evo‐
lutionary adaptations including migration. Selection pressures 
change quickly, favoring individuals that are better adapted to 
human‐modified landscapes (Otto, 2018). These human‐shaped 
selection pressures are caused by hunting, poisoning, electrocu‐
tion, food subsidies or global habitat and climate change, and many 
more (Oro, Genovart, Tavecchia, Fowler, & Martínez‐Abraín, 2013;

Abstract
Human‐induced changes in the climate and environment that occur at an unprec‐
edented speed are challenging the existence of migratory species. Faced with these 
new challenges, species with diverse and flexible migratory behaviors may suffer less 
from population decline, as they may be better at responding to these changes by 
altering their migratory behavior. At the individual level, variations in migratory be‐
havior may lead to differences in fitness and subsequently influence the population's 
demographic dynamics. Using lifetime GPS bio‐logging data from 169 white storks 
(Ciconia ciconia), we explore whether the recently shortened migration distance of 
storks affects their survival during different stages of their juvenile life. We also ex‐
plore how other variations in migratory decisions (i.e., time, destination), movement 
activity (measured using overall body dynamic acceleration), and early life conditions 
influence juvenile survival. We observed that their first autumn migration was the 
riskiest period for juvenile white storks. Individuals that migrated shorter distances 
and fledged earlier experienced lower mortality risks. In addition, higher movement 
activity and overwintering “closer‐to‐home” (with 84.21% of the tracked individu‐
als stayed Europe or North Africa) were associated with higher survival. Our study 
shows how avian migrants can change life history decisions over only a few decades, 
and thus it helps us to understand and predict how migrants respond to the rapidly 
changing world.

Otto, 2018), and may indeed force migrants to respond quickly 
to survive. In recent years, numerous studies have shown that 
birds alter their migratory behavior by changing their routes and/
or timing, dynamically altering their wintering strategies, or even 
becoming residents (Fiedler, 2003; Palacín et al., 2017; Visser, 
Perdeck, Balen, & Both, 2009). Species with more diverse migra‐
tory behavior or higher overall flexibility seem to suffer less from 
population decline as they are better at adjusting to these changes 
(Gilroy, Gill, Butchart, Jones, & Franco, 2016; Saino et al., 2011), 
and human‐altered selection forces might favor individuals with 
certain behavioral or conditional traits (Otto, 2018). Thus, if an 
individual's behavioral traits or its decisions during ontogeny allow 
us to explain patterns of longevity, we will gain insights into basic 
life history evolution and understand how migrants respond to the 
changing world. It will also allow us to develop a toolset for con‐
servation managers to anticipate changes in populations of wild 
birds.
One frequently studied migrant is the white stork Ciconia 
ciconia. Many studies provide detailed knowledge on this widely 
distributed, opportunistic species: European white storks were 
exclusively migratory, but in the last three decades, it has been re‐
ported that the subpopulation that migrates on the western flyway 
between Central Europe, Iberia, and western Africa is shortening 
its migratory distances. New wintering and resident behavior 
emerged on the Iberian Peninsula (Tortosa, Manez, & Barcell, 
1995), resulting in larger numbers of wintering storks in Europe 
(Arizaga et al., 2018). New and stable food sources like open land‐
fills or the invasive red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii may 
be contributing to the resident behavior of storks (Gilbert et al., 
2016; Tortosa, Caballero, & Reyes‐López, 2002). In addition, win‐
tering in Europe may require less energy in terms of movement 
costs and foraging efforts (Flack et al., 2016; Rotics et al., 2017). 
Thus, the question emerges: is long‐distance migration in white 
storks decreasing or even disappearing? Current studies which in‐
vestigated the relationship between changes in migration strategy 
and breeding performance were inconsistent (Gilbert et al., 2016; 
Massemin‐Challet et al., 2006). Here we hypothesize that these 
current changes in the white stork's migratory behavior will be 
reflected in their overall fitness (i.e., individuals with shorter mi‐
gratory distance have higher survival), and thereby influence the 
entire population's demography.
Like in many long‐lived birds, the first year of life is the most 
challenging period for a stork (Rotics et al., 2016; Sergio et al., 
2011). Thus, due to this high mortality, we expect a strong selective 
pressure on white stork juveniles with differing traits. Thanks to 
technical and methodological improvements in bio‐logging, we now 
have the opportunity to reveal the relationship between migratory 
decisions and fitness consequences in the context of global changes 
(Kays, Crofoot, Jetz, & Wikelski, 2015; Wilmers et al., 2015). And 
because bio‐logging devices also have integrated sensors that mon‐
itor animal movement activity precisely, we may also gain insights 
into the birds' internal states and processes (Wilson et al., 2014). 
Here, we used the lifetime tracks of 169 white stork juveniles to 
link migratory decisions (i.e., time, distance, and destination), move‐
ment activity, and individual traits to their subsequent survival 
probabilities.
2 | METHODS
2.1 | Dataset
From 2013 to 2017, we equipped a total of 193 juvenile white 
storks from five different regions in Germany and Austria with 
solar GPS‐ACC loggers (e‐obs GmbH). The total weight of trans‐
mitter and harness was 66 g, corresponding to approximately 2% 
of the mean body mass of white storks (for details see Flack et al., 
2016). All tags recorded GPS locations and three‐dimensional body 
acceleration for 18 hr a day (between 2:00 and 20:00 UTC). GPS 
positions were recorded at intervals ranging from 1  s to 20  min; 
three‐axial body acceleration data (hereafter ACC) were collected 
in short bursts (lengths ranging from 1.2 to 4.1 s) every 0.5–10 min 
at 10.54–33.33  Hz. Data were stored on the device until down‐
loaded via an ultra‐high‐frequency radio link or sent via the mobile 
phone network. We excluded (a) 13 of the tagged chicks that did 
not fledge; (b) five individuals from Bavaria which migrated along 
the eastern migration route (i.e., through Eastern Europe and Israel 
to East Africa); (c) five individuals with broken tags, or a too tight 
harness (which we identified after removing the harness of the cap‐
tured bird); and (d) one bird that departed unusually late (departed 
at day of the year 277, population mean ± SD: 228.824 ± 11.120). 
Overall, 169 fledglings were included in this study, see details of 
tagging year and location in Appendix S1: Table S1. Permits for tag‐
ging and tracking were issued by the authorities of the correspond‐
ing Federal States of Germany.
2.2 | Hazard factors influencing survival
We examined the effect of the following migration decisions on sur‐
vival: departure date, movement distances, wintering region, and 
overall movement activity. Migration departure date was defined 
as the first day with a latitudinal difference of −0.38°, represent‐
ing a southward movement of approximately 50 km. We calculated 
the daily displacement distances (hereafter daily distance) as the 
distance between the first GPS locations of two consecutive days. 
Daily distances were log‐transformed. Wintering region was defined 
as the most southern point of the birds' first winter and grouped 
in three categories, that is, Europe (north of the Strait of Gibraltar), 
North Africa (between Strait of Gibraltar and 20°N), and Sub‐
Saharan Africa (between 12 and 20°N). Additionally, we examined 
how different individual traits in early life influence juvenile survival. 
These included hatching rank, number of siblings, sex, and fledging 
date (defined as the first of two consecutive days during which the 
distance to the nest exceeded 500 m). Fledging and departure dates 
were converted to day of the year (DOY, i.e., 1–366).
To delineate physical movement characteristics, we estimated 
movement activity levels using overall dynamic body acceleration

CHENG et al.
(hereafter ODBA), often used as a proxy for energy expenditure 
and a potential indicator of an animal's internal state (Wilson et al., 
2006). To calculate ODBA, we subtracted the daily mean of each 
acceleration axis from the corresponding raw values to remove the 
static component of ACC (Wilson et al., 2006). The sum of all three 
axes provided a series of ODBA values for each burst. Then we 
standardized the ODBA value of each burst by dividing it with the 
product of ACC sampling frequency and burst duration, and calcu‐
lated the median ODBA per day as daily ODBA. The ODBA calcu‐
lation was performed using the “moveACC” package in R v. 3.3.3 
(Scharf, 2018).
2.3 | Survival analysis
We defined three life phases to examine which factors impacted 
survival during these specific life history stages: postfledging pe‐
riod—after fledging and before migration onset; migration pe‐
riod—between departure date and September 30; and wintering 
period—between October 1 and February 28 of the following year 
(Rotics et al., 2017; Sanz‐Aguilar, Jovani, Melián, Pradel, & Tella, 
2015). Individuals that vanished or were alive by the end of the spe‐
cific time periods were censored (Therneau & Grambsch, 2013).
After visualizing GPS and ACC data, we identified an individual as 
dead when one of the following criteria was met: (a) accelerometer 
data showed a flat line for more than 24 hr; (b) GPS positions were 
located inside a radius of 100 m for more than three consecutive 
days; or (c) we observed GPS locations along, near, or inside an‐
thropogenic structures before the animal disappeared (e.g., houses, 
yards, roads identified using Google Earth). We confirmed or de‐
tected mortality by localizing the carcass in the field whenever pos‐
sible. For each mortality event, we defined the death day as the first 
stationary or motionless day. Individuals that disappeared without 
any death criteria being met were marked as vanished. In total, 64 
individuals survived until the end of their first winter; we identified 
58 deaths in the field, 21 deaths using GPS and ACC data, six in‐
stances by locating the stork near to human structures (death event 
­criteria iii), and 20 storks vanished due to unknown reasons. We 
had no ­incidents of birds losing their loggers. Also, we considered 
different tagging locations as a metapopulation and not differenti‐
ated them.
We used the Kaplan–Meier estimator (Collett, 2015) to illus‐
trate the overall survival pattern, estimate median survival day 
and survival rates (since fledging) for each of the specific life his‐
tory stages. To examine the relationship between survival and the 
above‐mentioned covariates, we used a Cox proportional hazards 
regression model (hereafter Cox model), as it is the most widely 
used multivariate survival analysis for continuous time‐to‐event 
data (Therneau & Grambsch, 2013). Because the covariates might 
influence survival differently during different life history stages, 
we built separate Cox models for each of the three stages. Daily 
ODBA and daily distances were summarized for each stage by cal‐
culating medians. We used restricted cubic splines (three degrees 
of freedom) to specify fledging and departure date (Harrell, 2015). 
We stratified tagging year to control for potential interannual vari‐
ation. Because conditions in one season may influence subsequent 
seasons through carry‐over effects (Klaassen et al., 2014), we in‐
cluded stage‐specific covariates into the models of subsequent 
life stages. The three initial full models are described in detail in 
Appendix S1: Table S2.
Regularization and variable selection using Elastic Net were 
performed using the “glmnet” package in R v.3.3.3 (Friedman, 
Hastie, & Tibshirani, 2009). If any nonlinear effects were se‐
lected, we included all knots of the restricted cubic spline term. 
Covariates with nonzero coefficients were refitted to the model 
with the “rms” package, and redundant predictors were dropped 
(Harrell, 2015). We used likelihood ratio tests to determine the 
models' overall statistical significance and Wald tests to deter‐
mine p‐values of the individual covariates. All diagnostics were 
performed and plotted using the “survival” and “rms” packages 
in R v.3.3.3 (Harrell, 2018; Therneau, 2015). Visualizations of 
log‐relative hazard for each covariate were adjusted by the other 
covariates of the model, and we used data between the 0.05 and 
0.95 quantiles. Detailed information on model diagnostics can be 
found in Appendix S2. We found the proportional hazard assump‐
tion did not hold true for one covariate (Appendix S2: Table S2).

We therefore tested the potential causes of the nonproportional 
hazard and added the interaction term in the final migration stage 
Cox model (Keele, 2010).
Finally, we determined how sensitive the models are to any po‐
tential bias caused by nonrandom censoring (Collett, 2015). Although 
we found that vanished birds were not randomly distributed, that 
is, vanished birds had a higher migration distance compared to alive 
birds (t = −3.355, df = 16.107, p = 0.004), and similar distances as 
dead individuals (t = −0.066, df = 21.472, p = 0.948), a sensitivity 
analysis suggested that our findings are robust to dependent censor‐
ing (see detailed discussion in Appendix S2).
3 | RESULTS
3.1 | Overall migration and survival pattern
All juvenile white storks migrated along the well‐described west‐
ern route, through the western European continent, and many 
crossed the Gibraltar Strait to reach finally the Sahel region or the 
coast of West Africa. The majority of deaths (84.88%) occurred 
on the European continent (Figure 1). Migration was the riskiest 
period for juvenile storks as it exhibited the steepest decrease in 
the survival probability curve (insert Figure 1, day 31–79). This

sharp decrease of survival probability slowed down during win‐
ter. Cumulated survival rates since fledging for the postfledging 
period, migration, and winter were 0.875 (95% CI = 0.827–0.927), 
0.609 (95% CI = 0.538–0.689), and 0.457 (95% CI = 0.384–0.543), 
respectively. Median survival time, that is, time point by which half 
of the storks were expected to survive, was 177 days (correspond‐
ing to early January).
3.2 | Hazard factors
During the postfledging period, 18 of 169 storks died. However, 
none of the covariates influenced survival during that period signifi‐
cantly. Thus, we mainly focus on migration and the wintering period.
We found that survival during migration was influenced by daily 
movement activities (ODBA), daily migration distance, fledging date 
(as nonlinear effect), and the interaction between daily distance and 
fledging date (Appendix S2: Table S3, df = 8, R2 = 0.453, log‐ratio test 
p = 0.000). Larger daily ODBA, shorter daily migration distance, and 
early fledging dates were linked to reduced mortality risks during mi‐
gration (Figure 2a–c). In addition, the relationship between migration 
distance and mortality was influenced by fledging date (Figure 2d), 
showing that survival was relatively independent of migration dis‐
tance around the median fledging date July 15th. Storks that fledged 
earlier and migrated less than the median of the population had the 
lowest mortality risk.
We found that during winter, median ODBA and wintering region 
affected juvenile survival (Appendix S2: Table S5, df = 3, R2 = 0.202, 
log‐ratio test p  =  0.007). Similar to migration, larger median daily 
ODBA reduced the mortality risk, after controlling for wintering 
regions (Figure 2e). Individuals overwintering in Europe and North 
Africa had lower mortality hazards compared to those staying in the 
traditional wintering grounds of Sub‐Saharan Africa (Figure 2f).
4 | DISCUSSION
By exploring the lifetime tracks of juvenile white storks, we obtained 
a robust estimation of true survival rates and identified hazard fac‐
tors in the early life stages of this long‐lived migrant. Our results 
showed that the first southward migration is the riskiest period for 
juvenile white storks. In agreement with our hypothesis, we found 
that mortality risk increases with migration distance, a finding that 
is in accordance with other long‐distance migrants (Klaassen et al., 
2014; Lok et al., 2015). This relationship was also reflected in the 
effect of the chosen wintering region. Low survival probabilities of 
storks overwintering in Sub‐Saharan Africa may drive the overall 
change in migration strategy that has been observed in the last three 
decades. It may also explain why only a small number of our study 
individuals (15.79%) moved toward Sub‐Saharan Africa, whereas the 
majority of juveniles adopted the “closer‐to‐home” strategy, that is, 
terminated their migratory journey on the Iberian Peninsula (55.26%) 
or in North Africa (28.95%), where they experienced lower mortality 
rate during winter.
Even though successful storks migrate shorter distances and 
benefitting from sufficient food and warmer temperatures in these 
southerly European regions (Martín, Onrubia, & Ferrer, 2016), we 
observed that higher movement activities (ODBA) during migration 
and wintering lowered their mortality risks. Because the flight costs 
for soaring migrants are relatively low (Duriez et al., 2014), we sug‐
gest that high values of daily ODBA point toward more intensive 
foraging behavior during both the migration and wintering period. 
Previous studies found that storks with lower flight ODBA survive 
better (Rotics et al., 2016), or travel further (Flack, Nagy, Fiedler, 
Couzin, & Wikelski, 2018), but our findings cannot be directly linked 
to individual flight performance, as our metric for median daily 
ODBA did not only include flight but the birds' overall activities.
Like in other species (Menu, Gauthier, & Reed, 2005; Naef‐
Daenzer, Widmer, & Nuber, 2001), later fledging juveniles experi‐
enced higher mortality risks. This relationship was influenced by 
migration distance: if individuals fledged before or after the median 
fledging date, their survival was influenced more strongly by migra‐
tory distance, indicating that their optimal migratory strategy was 
state‐dependent (Figure 2d). None of the other examined individ‐
ual traits, that is, sex, hatch rank, numbers of siblings, or departure 
date influenced short‐term survival. This may be because storks can 
potentially compensate for differences in nestling body conditions 
later on in life (Aguirre & Vergara, 2007), although we did not ob‐
serve a relationship between hatching rank and migratory distance, 
as suggested in that study.
As an opportunistic species, white storks exhibit high levels 
of behavioral flexibility and can potentially adapt relatively fast to 
changing environments (Cuadrado, Sánchez, Barcell, & Armario, 
2016; Martín et al., 2016). In the mid‐twentieth century, droughts 
in the Sahel region had a strong negative effect on the western 
subpopulation of white stork. Although precipitation conditions 
gradually improved (Nevoux, Barbraud, & Barbraud, 2008), hunting 
pressure has increased drastically in this region (Zwarts, Bijlsma, 
Kamp, & Wymenga, 2012), representing a new significant threat to 
migrating birds. Our data show that 41.67% of the storks that over‐
wintered in Sub‐Saharan Africa died due to hunting (five out of 12). 
Thus, given the effect of wintering region on survival, we expect that 
the number of juveniles overwintering in Europe keeps increasing. 
It has also been suggested that adults which overwinter closer to 
home or even stay completely at their breeding grounds might ex‐
perience benefits during the upcoming breeding season (Arizaga et 
al., 2018; Rotics et al., 2018) and that migratory distance of white 
storks decreases with age (Fiedler, 2001). We therefore suggest that 
both the potential breeding benefits for adults and the higher juve‐
nile survival contribute to the increasing number of wintering white 
storks in Europe and that a shortening of migratory distance could 
be the optimal migration strategy for the current western European 
white stork population.
In the past few decades, we have witnessed that white storks 
change their behavior as a response to human‐caused alterations 
in their environmental surroundings, yet the future development 
of these behavioral changes is unclear. The number of white storks

overwintering in Portugal has already increased tenfold in the last 
two decades (Catry et al., 2017). It has also been documented that an 
increasing number of individuals of the Spanish subpopulation use 
their nests all year round (Gilbert et al., 2016), suggesting an inten‐
sified competition among breeders. Density‐dependent intraspe‐
cific competitions and the foreseeable closure of landfill locations 
(Gilbert et al., 2016; Sanz‐Aguilar et al., 2015) might cause further 
alterations of white stork migration and survival patterns. Although 
for Egypt vultures Neophron percnopterus no negative short‐term ef‐
fects of the landfill closures have been documented (Katzenberger 
et al., 2017), it is hard to predict the future consequences for white 
storks. Their highly flexible behavior might enable them to regain 
a long‐distance migratory strategy once selection pressures change 
again. Thus, further studies are essential to investigate how envi‐
ronmental or social conditions influence the life history strategies of 
white storks from different populations (Chapman et al., 2011; Gillis, 
Green, Middleton, & Morrissey, 2008).
