Abstract. Seven oceanographic cruises in 5 years were organized in the Sea of Sardinia with the repeated
collection of physical, chemical and biological data. An accurate and sustained quality assurance on physical
sensors was enacted through pre- and postcruise calibration and veriﬁed during in situ acquisitions with the use
of redundant sensors and other instruments. Moreover, for dissolved oxygen and conductivity, seawater samples
at standard depths were frequently analyzed on board. Then an accurate quality control was used to verify
all hydrological data proﬁles, which passed a further quality check following standard procedures. Finally all
hydrological data have been included in two online public open-access datasets in the SEANOE (SEA scieNtiﬁc
Open data Edition) repository (https://doi.org/10.17882/59867 and https://doi.org/10.17882/70340; Ribotti et al.,
2019a, b). During and after all cruises Chlorophyll a and nutrient analyses were also carried out, but these data
are not yet open access; the same applies for water current proﬁles, both at casts and during vessel moves, and
geophysical data. These ocean data are the ﬁrst covering the Sea of Sardinia for its whole extension. Here data
and assurance and control procedures used are described as they have become standards in deep-sea acquisitions
over the years.

Introduction
Between May 2000 and January 2004 the National Research
Council (CNR) of Italy collected hydrodynamic, chemical
and biological data in the Sea of Sardinia during seven mul-
tidisciplinary oceanographic cruises, MedGOOS 1 to Med-
GOOS 7. These cruises were the ﬁrst covering the whole
Sea of Sardinia, from the shelf to the open sea, with oceano-
graphic measurements. They were realized with the main aim
of making a useful contribution to the knowledge of the local
upper, intermediate and deep circulation and its interaction
with the general Mediterranean circulation.
The study area is limited to between 38 and 42◦N in lati-
tude and between 7◦E and the western Sardinian coast in lon-
gitude, with an offshore bottom reaching a depth of 2950 m
in the abyssal plain. The shelf extends from 5.5 km in the
north to 37 km in its center with a shelf break at about a
200 m depth (Conforti et al., 2016; Brambilla et al., 2019).
It is an area of passage of recirculating waters between the
two Mediterranean sub-basins and the Atlantic Ocean (As-
traldi et al., 19varia99; Millot, 2005; Millot and Taupier-
Letage, 2005; Schroeder et al., 2013) and is strongly inﬂu-
enced by the Algerian large-scale dynamics (Bouzinac and
Millot, 1999; Puillat et al., 2002; Pessini et al., 2018). Very
energetic surface fronts, cyclonic and anticyclonic vortices,
and up- and downwelling events play an important role in
the variability in and transport of physical, biological and
chemical characteristics of the water masses (Puillat et al.,
2003, 2006; Santinelli et al., 2008; Olita et al., 2013, 2014).
Here, thanks to the data acquired during the ﬁrst MedGOOS
cruises, Puillat et al. (2003) and Ribotti et al. (2004) identi-
ﬁed the main water masses usually observed in the rest of the
western Mediterranean sea, like the Atlantic Water (AW) in
the upper 150 m, the Winter Intermediate Water and its mod-
iﬁed version known as the temperature minimum layer (Ben-

zohra and Millot, 1995; Sorgente et al., 2003; Allen et al.,
2008) at about 100–120 m depth in the AW, the intermediate
waters below to an 800 m depth and the Western Mediter-
ranean Deep Water (WMDW) to the bottom. Here, since
2005 the old WMDW has been undermined by the warmest
and saltier new WMDW that diffused all over the western
Mediterranean sub-basin due to the transfer of the Eastern
Mediterranean Transient signal inside. This water is charac-
terized by high heat and salt content from the advected Lev-
antine Intermediate Water (LIW), forming the new WMDW
in the northwestern Mediterranean sub-basin (Gasparini et
al., 2005; Schroeder et al., 2006; Zunino et al., 2012; Ribotti
et al., 2016).
Due to such oceanographic importance, since the 1950s
French or Italian unsystematic cruises have been organized
in the area, whose data are available in the PANGAEA
(https://www.pangaea.de, last access: 20 December 2019)
and SEANOE (SEA scieNtiﬁc Open data Edition) reposito-
ries (Dumas et al., 2018). In 2014, the NATO Science and
Technology Organization (STO) Centre for Maritime Re-
search and Experimentation (CMRE), based in La Spezia,
organized a 2-week experiment with extensive use of ocean
instruments and two research vessels in a limited area
(110 km × 110 km). Its aims were to improve local ocean nu-
merical simulations and forecasts and study the local ocean
variability and structures (Onken, 2017a, b; Knoll et al.,
2017; Hemming et al., 2017; Onken et al., 2018; Hernandez-
Lasheras and Mourre, 2018).
Then recent experiments with drifters and deep-sea gliders
were realized in the Sea of Sardinia and between Sardinia and
the Balearic Islands, partially described by Olita et al. (2014).
In 2000–2004, instruments, sensors and data passed strin-
gent controls following internationally accepted oceano-
graphic processes necessary to obtain high-quality data.
These practices included quality assurance, control and as-
sessment according to standards and best practices that have
been reﬁned till the present (Hood et al., 2010; Bushnell et
al., 2019; Pearlman et al., 2019). In this paper we describe all
the procedures or best practices followed to assure and con-
trol the quality of the acquired data during the MedGOOS
cruises, the sensors used, and the sensors’ calibrations and
intercomparisons.
Acquired hydrological data are in two datasets stored in
an open-access repository, SEANOE (Ribotti et al., 2019a,
b), linked with the EMODnet data network of marine cen-
ters and European thematic data portals like SeaDataNet and
EurOBIS.
In the following two sections (Sects. 2 and 3) the ves-
sel, instruments and sensors used in the seven cruises are
described, with a distinction between data in repositories
(Sect. 2) and not part of any repository (Sect. 3). The cali-
bration of temperature and conductivity sensors is described
Sect. 4, while in Sect. 5 the onboard control of CTD sen-
sor stability is detailed. Discussion and conclusions close the
paper.

Instrumentation technology
During the seven cruises, proﬁles of physical–chemical pa-
rameters were acquired at planned stations, whose number
varied due to the length of and the strategy adopted in each
cruise, the wideness of the covered area, and the sea con-
ditions. So the activities range from the 38 stations realized
during the 6 d long MedGOOS 1 in 2000 and the 92 during
the 21 d long MedGOOS 6 in 2003. In September 2001, only
the southern part of the Sea of Sardinia with 41 stations was
covered due to bad weather conditions.
The 61.30 m long R/V Urania of CNR was used in all
cruises. This was a modern multidisciplinary research ves-
sel equipped with instruments to study physical and chemical
water quality parameters and laboratories for biological and
geological analyses. For its dynamic positioning the vessel
was equipped with an integrated navigation system consti-
tuting two DGPS antennas and one Loran-C receiver that en-
sured an optimal use of the scientiﬁc equipment during the
cruises. Such a system was managed through software by
Andrews Hydrographics installed on a 33 MHz HP386 PC,
which permitted the downloading of navigation and meteoro-
logical data in ASCII format with geographic and kilometric
coordinates at a frequency of 10 min.
On board, an SBE 911plus CTD probe (by Sea-Bird Sci-
entiﬁc, Inc.), mounted on a 24 10 L Niskin bottles rosette
for water column sampling, was used to acquire hydrolog-
ical data during all the seven cruises (Fig. 1).
Speciﬁcally, the sensors installed on the probe had the fol-
lowing characteristics (Table 1).
– Pressure (db). A Digiquartz 4000 pressure transducer
was used. The transducer had a resolution of 0.01 ppm,
oscillator frequency of 34–38 KHz and temperature
range of 0–125 ◦C.
– Water temperature (◦C). An SBE 3F thermometer was
used with a response time of 70 ms, temperature range
of −5 to +35 ◦C, accuracy of about 0.004 ◦C yr−1 and a
resolution of 0.0003 ◦C. The international practical tem-
perature scale known as IPTS-68 was applied on data
from MedGOOS 1, 2 and 6, while the international tem-
perature scale of 1990, known as ITS-90, was applied on
data from MedGOOS 4 and from MedGOOS 3, 5, 7 on
secondary sensors.
– Conductivity (mS cm−1). An SBE 4 sensor was
used with a range of 0.0–7 S m−1, resolution of
0.00004 S m−1, accuracy of about 0.0003 S m−1 per
month, and response time of 0.085sec with pump or
0.17 s without pump.
– Dissolved oxygen. An SBE 13 Beckman or YSI sen-
sor was used with a range of 0.0–15 mL L−1, accuracy
of 0.1 mL L−1, resolution of 0.01 mL L−1 and response
time of 2 s at a temperature of 25 ◦C during cruises Med-
GOOS 1, 2, 3 and 4. During cruises MedGOOS 5, 6

and 7, an SBE 43 polarographic membrane sensor for
pumped CTD applications with titanium (7000 m) hous-
ing was used with a range of 120 % of surface saturation
in all natural waters and accuracy of ±2 % of saturation.
– Fluorescence. A Sea Tech Inc. ﬂuorometer was used
with the energy emitted by the ﬂash lamp of 0.25 J for
the ﬂash, a temperature range of 0–25 ◦C and a resolu-
tion of 0.15 µg L−1.
Redundant or secondary sensors were always used for a data
quality assessment (as deﬁned in Bushnell et al., 2019) of
both temperature and salinity measurements, except during
the cruise MedGOOS 1 in May–June 2000 (see Table 1).
A secondary SBE 43 sensor for dissolved oxygen was also
added just in the last three cruises, from MedGOOS 5 to 7.
These redundant sensors were a useful method of comparison
to evaluate the stability of primaries both during the acquisi-
tion and at a following visual quality check of proﬁles.
For the same reason, RTM 4002 digital deep-sea revers-
ing thermometers by Sensoren Instrumente Systeme GmbH
(SiS) were mounted on Niskin bottles during MedGOOS 4
(three thermometers) and 5 (four thermometers). These in-
struments acquired sea temperature at depths, deﬁned by the
closing of the Niskin bottle they were mounted on, usually
sampling near the bottom where temperature is more stable.
Reversing thermometers had a depth range of up to 10 000 m
and a temperature range of between −2 ◦C and +40 ◦C.
They had a resolution of ±0.001 ◦C between −2.000 and
19.999 ◦C and of ±0.01 ◦C between 20.00 and 40.00 ◦C and
a stability of 0.00025 ◦C per month. Its pressure housing was
made of a glass tube closed at its ends by metal stoppers, one
containing the platinum sensor and the other the battery. Its
internal mercury switch was activated by inverting the instru-
ment at deﬁned depths.

Other acquisitions
In some cruises (see Table 1) current meter data were ac-
quired both at a station (lowered acoustic Doppler current
proﬁler or LADCP) and en route (shipborne acoustic Doppler
current proﬁler or SADCP), while geophysical sub-bottom
proﬁler data were just acquired during the cruise Med-
GOOS 2. At casts, the real-time display of CTD data made it
possible to identify a certain number of stations where to take
water samples for the estimation of nutrients (nitrites, nitrates
and phosphates), Chlorophyll a, chromophoric dissolved or-
ganic matter (CDOM) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC).
As all these data are not in the two datasets in the SEANOE
repository mentioned above (Ribotti et al., 2019a, b), they
will be shortly described here as part of the cruises data. All
measures were carried out trying to reconcile the different
procedures.
The sub-bottom proﬁler was a GeoPulse Transmitter
Model 5430A at frequencies ranging between 2 and 15 kHz
with a maximum emitted power of 10 kW. It was just used
on a small portion of the western Sardinian shelf north of
Oristano in April 2001 during the cruise MedGOOS 2.
Starting from the cruise MedGOOS 2, proﬁles of cur-
rent speed were acquired during CTD casts by two syn-
chronized 300 kHz RDI Workhorse acoustic Doppler cur-
rent proﬁlers (ADCPs), by RD Instruments Inc. (now Tele-
dyne), USA, conﬁgured in “Lowered” mode and installed on
the rosette with one looking up (named slave) and the other
down (named master). They acquired horizontal current data
in 20 cells each with a 10 m width from the instrument with
an impulse per second. Then under the keel of the vessel,
a 38 kHz ADCP proﬁled currents in 8 m wide cells over a
1000 m depth through an impulse per second during trans-
fers between stations. Another impulse was used to correct
the water speed and obtain its real speed as regards the sea
bottom (bottom tracking). Conﬁguration of ADCPs used in
the two modes, Lowered and Shipborne, in 2001–2004 are in
agreement with the more recent internationally recognized
GO-SHIP protocols described by Hood et al. (2010).
For Chlorophyll a (Chl a), CDOM and DOC, all the wa-
ter samples were ﬁltered on 0.42 µm Whatman GF/F glass

(Sartorius, Minisart, SM 16534 K) for DOC and CDOM;
this was to remove the particulate fraction immediately af-
ter collection. Then ﬁlters were frozen at +4 ◦C to be an-
alyzed at labs following standard procedures described by
Lazzara et al. (1990) for Chl a and by Vignudelli et al. (2004)
and Santinelli et al. (2008) for CDOM and DOC. For nutri-
ents, during the ﬁrst three MedGOOS cruises, water samples
were partially analyzed on board by a Systea µCHEM au-
toanalyzer, while remaining samples were frozen at −20 ◦C
following Strickland and Parsons (1972). In the following
cruises all water samples were frozen and then analyzed once
back in the laboratory.

Pre- and postcruise calibration procedures
The pre- and postcruise calibration of the sensors of temper-
ature and conductivity was performed at the oceanographic
instrument (CTD) calibration facilities of the SACLANT Un-
dersea Research Center (SACLANTCEN, now STO-CMRE)
in La Spezia, Italy. The center was funded in 1959 ini-
tially for submarine warfare, but it developed and main-
tained an oceanographic instruments test and calibration fa-
cility that enabled the acquisition of high-quality ocean data
and was unique in Italy for years. Two calibration seawa-
ter tanks were equipped with two very high precision Neil
Brown ATB-1250 platinum resistance thermometer bridges
for temperature and two very high precision Neil Brown
CSA-1250 conductivity–salinity adaptors for conductivity.
Seawater samples were analyzed for conductivity by a high-
precision 8400B Autosal laboratory salinometer, from Guild-
line Instruments Ltd., standardized with International As-
sociation for the Physical Sciences of the Oceans (IAPSO)
Standard Seawater and an accuracy of < 0.002 psu on a range
of salinity between 2 and 42 psu.
Before SBE sensors calibration, the two temperature sen-
sors in the bath were adjusted to a triple-point-of-water cell
(TPW) at the temperature of 0.01 ◦C and a thermometric
standard gallium-melting-point cell for the highest value of
29.7646 ◦C. So at SACLANTCEN a calibration of these sen-
sors was realized exceeding World Ocean Circulation Exper-
iment (WOCE) standards (Millard and Yang, 1993). These
two calibrations permitted us to substantially generate a slope
correction, used in the conﬁguration ﬁle of the SBE Seasoft
suite of programs, for data acquired during each cruise, thus
improving their quality.

Onboard control of CTD sensors stability
Despite the calibration of temperature and conductivity sen-
sors before and after each cruise, all sensors can signiﬁcantly
drift over the course of a cruise. This can dramatically reduce

the quality of the data. As high-quality conductivity and oxy-
gen data enable the deﬁnition of local water masses with high
precision, particularly in the deep sea, then the use of interna-
tional standards is mandatory in oceanography. The stability
of conductivity and dissolved oxygen (DO) sensors must be
veriﬁed on board through a comparison with data from wa-
ter samples. During the cruise all involved personnel and all
acquired data are usually together, so it is relatively easy to
check and correct repetitive problems before they can further
degrade the data.
Conductivity data were checked against the onboard anal-
yses by a Guildline 8400B Autosal laboratory salinometer,
similar to that described above, while DO data were analyzed
using the Winkler titration method with a measured precision
in triplicate analyzed samples of 0.01 mL L−1 (expressed in
standard deviation units). The sampling was at deﬁned depths
at the surface; at 25, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 750, 1000,
1250, 1500, 1750, 2000, 2500 and 3000 m; and at the bottom.
The Autosal salinometer was operated in a small
temperature-regulated room, part of the onboard wet labo-
ratory, and its bath temperature was held at 24 ± 2 ◦C. The
salinometer was standardized daily with the use of IAPSO
Standard Seawater provided by 200 mL clear sealed glass
bottles, before starting the analyses. Seawater for conductiv-
ity was taken after that for DO and collected in 250 mL clear
bottles with screw caps. Each bottle and cap was rinsed three
times with the sampled water, and each bottle was ﬁlled to its
shoulder. Then the bottles were stored for no longer than 24 h
in the conditioned room before their analyses. Niskin bottles
collected water at the deepest casts of the cruise and at least
once a day.
The oxygen sensors used during the cruises were not cal-
ibrated, so during each cruise different veriﬁcations were re-
alized to verify possible sensors shifts through the Winkler
titration method (Winkler, 1888). This method, used for in
situ DO analyses, consists of reacting oxygen in the sam-
ples with two reagents (I and II) and with a ﬁnal titration.
The reagent I is a solution of MnSO4 and NaOH, while the
reagent II is a solution of NaI and H2SO4. The utmost at-
tention is paid to draw the oxygen samples ﬁrst from Niskin
bottles and into dark glass bottles. This avoids the formation
of air bubbles during the sampling itself or the execution of
the analysis. The sampling was realized as for conductivity
considering frequency and methodology. The water sampled
at 100 m of depth was used to obtain three blank solutions in
dark glass bottles and one standard solution in a larger plastic
bottle. So blanks and standards were run often. Then differ-
ent quantities of reagents were added: 0.5 mL (the usual for
all samples) of reagent I and reagent II in the ﬁrst blank, its
double in the second blank, and its triple in the third. No
reagents were initially added in the standard solution. All
samples and the three blank solutions, not the standard, were
left in the dark for at least 2 h and then analyzed within 24 h
of their collection. During the analysis of the standard solu-
tion and reagents I and II, 0.5 mL L−1 of H2SO4 and then of

KIO3 were added. The samples have been analyzed through
the program TIAMO (TItration And MOre) 2.0 by Metrohm.
Thanks to the data from the water samples, the possible esti-
mations of changes in slope (Soc) and offset (Voffset), in the
linear relationship between oxygen concentration and volt-
age output that indicate a loss of sensitivity of the sensors,
were realized performing a linear regression line of the data
calculated from the following Eq. (1) (Owens and Millard Jr.,
1985; Millard and Yang, 1993; SBE, 2008a):
ϕ =Oxsol(T,S) · (1.0 + A · T + B · T 2 + C · T 3)

where Oxsol(T,S) is the oxygen solubility (mL L−1) at a de-
ﬁned temperature and salinity; T and K are the CTD temper-
atures in ◦C and in K; P is the CTD pressure (dbar); and A,
B, C and E are calibration coefﬁcients.
At a deﬁned deep station, the regression is calculated by
using the measured Winkler oxygen concentration divided
by ϕ as a dependent variable and the oxygen sensor output
voltage as an independent variable.
In Fig. 2 an example of linear regression applied on a deep
CTD station with the calculation of the new Soc (0.3936)
and the new Voffset = −0.2094/SOC = −0.2094/0.3936 =
−0.53201.
During cruises from MedGOOS 4 to MedGOOS 7 temper-
ature data were checked at deﬁned depths against reversing
thermometers installed that correspond to the bottles num-
bered 1, 3, 5 and 7 of the rosette sampler.
Furthermore CTD and oxygen data were compared with
those analyzed on board from samples or acquired with other
instruments in order to determine or visually check possible
shifts. Acquired CTD data were processed through the stan-
dardized procedures of the SBE Data Processing software.
After comparisons and in the case of malfunction, the use of
the secondary sensor instead of the primary was evaluated
(see in Fig. 3 a plot for conductivity and DO).
After the postcruise calibration, if the shift was constant
or systematic then an average of all data (primary, secondary,
samples, etc) was used to correct data. If the shift was ran-
dom, Soc and Voffset for DO, slope and offset for conductiv-
ity and temperature were recalculated and the data corrected

cence is reported in relative ﬂuorescence units (RFU) in the
datasets. Also pressure sensors were not calibrated as they
are usually stable, but, if problems occurred, they were sent
to SBE Inc. in the United States for calibration.

Data availability
The two datasets described in this study are publicly avail-
able free of charge from the SEANOE data repository (Ri-
botti et al., 2019a, https://doi.org/10.17882/59867, and Ri-
botti et al., 2019b, https://doi.org/10.17882/70340). The pre-
sented datasets are composed of CTD data in Ocean Data
View (ODV) TXT spreadsheet and collection ﬁle formats di-
vided per cruise. Metadata are available in TXT, RIS, XLS,
RTF and BIBTEX formats.
The rescue and reprocessing of hydrodynamic data is
ongoing in order to reorganize them, in a quality con-
trolled manner, into a database. The same will be carried
out for the biological parameters. A ﬁrst dataset of nutri-
ents data from more recent cruises (late 2014–2017) is avail-
able at https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2019-136 (Belgacem et
al., 2019).

Discussion and conclusion
Several processes to obtain high-quality ocean data were fol-
lowed during the 2000–2004 MedGOOS cruises in the Sea
of Sardinia, western Mediterranean. Quality assurance, con-
trol and assessment, according to standard and best practices,
deﬁned at international level (see Bushnell et al., 2019) and
after decades of application in ocean data acquisition, were
considered during all cruises and are in agreement with re-
cent standardized procedures for all sensors (Hood et al.,
2010). Sensors underwent pre- and postcruise calibration and
included redundancies during cruises; results were compared
with water samples analyzed on board. These efforts have led
to the achievement of the standard precision required even to-
day, thanks to the accuracy of the sensors used. Uncertainty
in measurements, deﬁned as “the quantiﬁcation of the doubt
that exists about results of any measurements”, exists in these
data but has been reduced by the skill of the same opera-
tors or analysts following all the processes at any time for
all the included years and cruises. Now oceanographic data
from seven cruises are collected in two open-access datasets
available online, including ocean parameters like conductiv-
ity, temperature, DO and Chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence. These
ocean data are the ﬁrst available for the Sea of Sardinia and
are important for characterizing the general circulation and
the dynamics in the western Mediterranean.
