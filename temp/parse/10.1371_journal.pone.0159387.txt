Abstract
The genome of a laboratory-adapted strain of Leptospira interrogans serovar Hardjo was
sequenced and analyzed. Comparison of the sequenced genome with that recently pub-
lished for a field isolate of the same serovar revealed relatively high sequence conservation
at the nucleotide level, despite the different biological background of both samples. Con-
versely, comparison of both serovar Hardjo genomes with those of L. borgpetersenii sero-
var Hardjo showed extensive differences between the corresponding chromosomes,
except for the region occupied by their rfb loci. Additionally, comparison of the serovar
Hardjo genomes with those of different L. interrogans serovars allowed us to detect several
genomic features that may confer an adaptive advantage to L. interrogans serovar Hardjo,
including a possible integrated plasmid and an additional copy of a cluster encoding a mem-
brane transport system known to be involved in drug resistance. A phylogenomic strategy
was used to better understand the evolutionary position of the Hardjo serovar among L.
interrogans serovars and other Leptospira species. The proposed phylogeny supports the
hypothesis that the presence of similar rfb loci in two different species may be the result of a
lateral gene transfer event.
Introduction
Leptospirosis is a bacterial zoonosis which impacts both human and animal health worldwide
and is caused by pathogenic members of the genus Leptospira. The members of this genus have
been classified into more than 250 serovars, grouped into 24 antigenically related serogroups
[1]. This classification is based on serovar-specific antisera reacting mainly against components
of the surface lipopolysaccharide (LPS). DNA-DNA hybridization has been used to classify
Leptospira into species, while phylogenetic studies based mainly on 16S rRNA sequences have
been used to further classify species into groups [2]. However, correlation between serological
and DNA-based classification is poor, as members of the same serovar may belong to different
species [3].

Some Leptospira serovars are adapted to a particular host species and asymptomatically
infect renal tubules during host adaptation. Certain serovar determinants, such as the O-anti-
gen of LPS, are thought to be involved in host selection by mechanisms that are largely
unknown [4]. Serovar Hardjo belonging to L. interrogans and L. borgpetersenii are known to be
adapted to cattle. L. borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo is the most common host-adapted species in
cattle all over the world, while the pattern of host adaptation for L. interrogans serovar Hardjo
is relatively unclear [5]. Although both belong to two different species, they were confirmed to
have a very similar rfb locus, the gene cluster encoding the enzymes involved in LPS biosynthe-
sis [6]. The presence of almost identical rfb loci can be associated with a similar LPS structure,
which further explains the similar serological reaction in these rather different species. A con-
vergent evolution of the loci due to acquisition of genes via lateral gene transfer was proposed
as an explanation for this observation.
L. interrogans serovar Hardjo differs from its L. borgpetersenii counterpart in several clinical
and epidemiological aspects. Infection of cattle with L. interrogans serovar Hardjo has been
associated with a rate of abortion of 30%, reasonably higher than that caused by L. borgpeterse-
nii serovar Hardjo, which is around 3–10% [7]. In addition, L. interrogans serovar Hardjo has
been specifically associated with the development of milk drop syndrome in dairy cows as a
consequence of acute infection [8]. The genome of a field isolate of L. interrogans serovar
Hardjo (strain Norma) was recently published [9], however no functional or evolutionary anal-
ysis was provided in the article. In the present study, we sequenced, assembled and annotated
the genome of a laboratory-adapted strain of L. interrogans serovar Hardjo (serogroup Sejroe,
strain Hardjoprajitno). Analysis of the sequenced chromosomes allowed us to further study the
genetic background of L. interrogans serovar Hardjo and its evolutionary relationship with
other members of the genus Leptospira.
Materials and Methods
Bacterial Culture and DNA Extraction
The L. interrogans serovar Hardjo strain sequenced in this study was obtained from the
National Veterinary Services Laboratory (Ames, Iowa, USA). This strain was originally isolated
from a human patient in Indonesia and has been routinely used in veterinary diagnostic labora-
tories in the United States. The strain was maintained in the laboratory in Ellinghausen-
McCullough-Johnson-Harris (EMJH) medium and passaged for several generations. Genomic
DNA for sequencing was isolated using the MasterPure™Complete DNA and RNA Purifica-
tion Kit (Epicentre, USA) following manufacturer’s instructions.
Genome Sequencing, Assembly and Annotation
Genomic DNA was sequenced at the Georgia Genomics Facility of the University of Georgia
(UGA) by using the Illumina MiSeq technology with standard protocols. Reads were trimmed
and cropped to 250 bp by using trimmomatic [10] to remove low-quality positions from the 3'
end. De novo assembly was performed by using SPAdes [11], with the recommended options
for MiSeq reads. Contigs were further scaffolded by using ABACAS [12] and the genome of L.
interrogans serovar Lai strain 56601 [13] as a reference. Gene models annotated in the genome
of serovar Lai and in that of the closely related serovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1-130 [14]
were transferred to the contiguated pseudochromosomes by using RATT [15]. BaSYS [16] was
also used for de novo gene detection. All lines of evidence for gene models were manually
revised and merged using Artemis and the Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT) [17]. To avoid the
relatively high levels of over-annotation that has been reported for other Leptospira genomes
when using automatic pipelines [18], we followed the guidelines described by Bulach et al. [19]

for the annotation of two L. borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo genomes. Read mapping to reference
genomes was performed with BWA [20] and variant calling from read alignments was done
with SAMtools (v. 0.1.19) [21].
Functional and Phylogenomic Analyses
OrthoMCL [22] was used to cluster the genes of the newly annotated serovar Hardjo genome
along with those from another 23 selected Leptospira genomes previously submitted to Gen-
bank (Table 1). Each ortholog group was tested for evidence of selection, either positive or neg-
ative, by comparing models 1 and 2 of the codeml program from the PAML 4 package [23].
Protein sequences were aligned with MAFFT [24] and the alignments were further refined by
using Gblocks [25]. Phylogenetic trees were built with PhyML 3.0 [26] under the best model
predicted by ProtTest3 [27], with bootstrap values for branch support resulting from 500 boot-
strap replicates.
Results
Assembly and Annotation of the L. interrogans Serovar Hardjo Genome
Raw sequences of MiSeq reads generated in this study were deposited in the Sequence Read
Archive (SRA) under the accession code SRX1830060. De novo assembly of the MiSeq reads
with SPAdes resulted in 101 contigs larger than 500 bp, with an N50 size of 168 kb and a total
size of 4.76 Mb. We were able to contiguate 71 of these contigs into two pseudomolecules

corresponding to chromosomes I (4.34 Mb) and II (353 kb), by using ABACAS and the
genome of L. interrogans serovar Lai as a reference. The remaining 30 contigs could not be
incorporated into the contiguated pseudomolecules mainly due to their repetitive nature. This
set of unplaced contigs represents a 2% of the total bases in the original de novo assembly and
are available to download from our project’s website (http://bioinfo.indicasat.org.pa/lepto.
html).
RATT was able to transfer 97% and 98% of the gene models annotated in the genomes of L.
interrogans serovar Lai and Copenhageni, respectively, to the contiguated pseudochromo-
somes. The transferred gene models were manually revised and combined with 4,739 addi-
tional ones predicted by BaSYS. Final revision of the annotation included 3,754 predicted
protein-coding genes, 3,466 in chromosome I and 288 in chromosome II. We also annotated
86 suspected pseudogenes, identified on the basis of models transferred by RATT with at least
one frameshift or internal stop codon, in cases where those artifacts could be confirmed in the
majority of the corresponding reads. The annotated genome was deposited in GenBank under
BioProject PRJNA296687 with accession numbers CP013147 (chromosome I) and CP013147
(chromosome II). General statistics regarding size and gene content of our annotated genome
are roughly similar to those of serovars Lai and Copenhageni (Table 2).
Our genome is very similar to that recently published for a field isolate of L. interrogans ser-
ovar Hardjo (strain Norma) [9]. Regions that could be aligned on a one-to-one basis between
both genomes share a 99.9% identity at the nucleotide level. These regions in turn represent a
98.4% of the strain Norma genome, with the remaining 1.6% comprising approximately 70 kb
of sequence that could not be found in our assembly, 67 kb from chromosome I and 2 kb from
chromosome II. These sequences roughly match to most of the contigs we were not able to con-
tiguate into our assembled pseudochromosomes due to their repetitive nature. All of these con-
tigs contain matches to sequences associated with repetitive elements commonly reported to be
present in Leptospira genomes [4], including prophages, transposons and insertion sequence
(IS) elements. Assembly of such elements is difficult, especially when using relatively short
reads such as those generated by using the MiSeq platform. We assume that such sequences
could be unequivocally incorporated into the strain Norma assembly because of to the larger
size of reads generated by the Roche’s 454 platform. To better study sequence variation
between the genomes of both strains, we aligned the raw reads from strain Hardjoprajitno to
the strain Norma genome. As expected, 99.8% of the reads from strain Hardjoprajitno could be
unambiguously mapped to the strain Norma genome, with a uniform coverage along both
chromosomes (S1 Fig). We found 262 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) located within
predicted protein-coding genes between both genomes (S1 Table). This number of SNPs is

relatively low when compared to those found when mapping the strain Hardjoprajitno reads to
the reference genomes of L. interrogans serovars Lai and Copenhageni, which were in the order
of 15,000 and 16,000, respectively (results not shown).
Except for those resulting from unplaced contigs, we found relatively few structural differ-
ences between the corresponding chromosomes from strains Norma and Hardjoprajitno (Fig 1,

S2 Table). However, the number of predicted gene models is surprisingly higher in the strain
Norma genome when compared to our annotation or to those of serovars Lai and Copenhageni.
This unexpected level of over-annotation in the strain Norma genome is likely to be a conse-
quence of using an automatic pipeline, a situation that has been reported for other Leptospira
genomes previously sequenced [18]. Although over-annotation complicates the comparison at
the level of gene content, we found no differences among those predicted genes and pseudo-
genes that are shared by both strains.
Comparative Genomics of the Hardjo Serovar
Comparison of the L. interrogans serovar Hardjo genome with those of serovars Lai and
Copenhageni revealed relatively high sequence similarity, except for the region occupied by
their corresponding rfb loci (Fig 1, S2 Fig). We noticed two inverted transpositions in the
genomes of serovar Hardjo when compared to the genome of serovar Lai, which are located
near the ends of the larger inversion previously reported between the genomes of serovar Lai
and Copenhageni. In contrast, comparison of the L. interrogans serovar Hardjo genomes with
those of L. borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo type A and type B [19] revealed extensive sequence
and structural variation, but high conservation in the region of the rfb locus.
We also observed three regions in chromosome I of both serovar Hardjo strains that are not
apparently present in the genomes of serovars Lai and Copenhageni (Fig 1, S3 Table). The first
of these regions has an approximate length of 12 kb and includes 18 predicted genes
(LIH_02395-LIH_02480 in strain Hardjoprajitno). The only gene in the region whose function
could be predicted was one located near its beginning, putatively encoding an ISX02-like
transposase.
The second region is slightly larger (~17 kb) and encompasses 27 predicted genes
(LIH_09760-LIH_09890 in strain Hardjoprajitno). All these genes are encoded in the same
strand and are very close together, which suggests that they may be co-transcribed as an
operon. Again, functions could not be predicted for most genes in the region, except for two
that appear to encode peptidases (LIH_09765 and LIH_09765) and two adjacent ones that
appear to encode a PIN domain protein (LIH_09845) and a plasmid replication initiation fac-
tor (LIH_09850), respectively. The PIN domain is typically found in ribonucleases that act as
the toxin component of type II toxin-antitoxin systems (TAs) [28]. Despite its relatively high
sequence similarity to those described in TAs, the PIN domain protein described here does not
appear to be adjacent to a gene encoding a putative antitoxin component, suggesting that if
active, it may fulfill a different function.
The third region is the largest one, spanning ~37 kb and including 30 predicted genes
(LIH_14055-LIH_14190 in strain Hardjoprajitno). Notably, the region contains a cluster of
genes predicted to encode components of a transporter from the resistance-nodulation-cell
division (RND) superfamily. Although several types of RND transporters have been described,
the one we report here seems to be of the tripartite type. This type is the most common one in
Gram-negative bacteria and is composed of an inner membrane exporter protein (AcrB), a
periplasmic membrane fusion protein (AcrA or MFP) and an outer membrane channel protein
(TolC) [29]. The cluster we found in this region includes two genes predicted to encode AcrB
transporters (LIH_14115 and LIH_14120), directly adjacent to a gene encoding the AcrA sub-
unit (LIH_14125) and a close gene encoding a TolC-like outer membrane efflux protein
(LIH_14150). A similarity search with the sequences of these genes revealed the presence of a
similar cluster in the genomes of most pathogenic species of Leptospira other than L. interro-
gans. For L. interrogans, a similar cluster could only be detected in serovars Bataviae, Canicola
and Pyrogenes.

Similarly, genes from the other two previously described regions appear to be present only
in some L. interrogans serovars and other close Leptospira species. Genes from the first region
appear to be present only in L. interrogans serovar Hardjo, while those from the second region
are present in L. santarosai, L. kirschneri and L. weilii, with only a few of them having detect-
able orthologs in serovars Bataviae and Manilae of L. interrogans.
We were also able to detect orthologs for many of these genes in genomes of unidentified
serovars, submitted to Genbank as part of the Leptospira Genomics and Human Health Project
sponsored by the J. Craig Venter Institute. Remarkably, almost all of these genes have collinear
orthologs in the genome of a strain Brem 329 isolated from a horse in Germany (BioProject
PRJNA167229). We also found a 99.9% identity at the nucleotide level between this genome
and the serovar Hardjo genome sequenced in this study. The corresponding rfb loci of both
genomes are also very similar. These findings suggest that the Brem 329 strain may belong to
the Hardjo serovar. Similarly, several loci in these regions have detectable orthologs in the
genomes of strains FPW1039 (BioProject PRJNA167242) and FPW2026 (BioProject
PRJNA74077). However, these genomes share lower sequence similarity with that of serovar
Hardjo, both overall and in the rfb loci, which suggests that the strains may belong to different
but probably evolutionarily related serovars.
Phylogenomic Approach to Study the Evolutionary Position of the Hardjo
Serovar
Given the differences observed among serovar Hardjo and other L. interrogans serovars, their
relationship in the context of the evolutionary history of Leptospira species was explored. We
utilized a strategy based on concatenation of sequences from orthologous genes, since com-
monly used phylogenetic markers such as 16S rRNA do not provide enough phylogenetic sig-
nal to properly separate serovars of the same species in phylogenies [30,31]. In this strategy, the
phylogenetic signal is increased by including as many genes as possible from the sequenced
genomes.
We initially performed an ortholog clustering analysis with the gene models annotated in
the L. interrogans serovar Hardjo genome along with those of 23 selected Leptospira specimens.
This set of genomes was selected on the basis of the differences we observed and mentioned in
the previous section, and it included one strain of L. biflexa, L. licerasiae and L. santarosai, four
strains of L. borgpetersenii (two of them from the Hardjo serovar), two strains of L. kirschneri
and 12 strains of L. interrogans. Nine of these L. interrogans strains belong to identified sero-
vars, two of serovar Lai and one of serovars Canicola, Bataviae, Pyrogenes, Linhai, Manilae and
Pomona, respectively. The remaining three strains included in the study are those with uniden-
tified serovar mentioned in the previous section. This analysis resulted in 8,470 ortholog
groups, out of which 1,565 have only one representative member in all the genomes considered
(S4 Table).
Although, as an initial approach we planned to include all of these “core” genes in the phylo-
genomic analysis, it has been shown that concatenating sequences from genes subjected to dif-
ferent evolutionary pressures may lead to erroneous phylogenetic reconstructions [32]. To
avoid this, we looked for evidence of natural selection in all ortholog groups and further
selected the groups suspected to have a neutral or nearly neutral evolution, that is, those with
an overall dN/dS ratio between 0.2–2.0, as suggested by Massey et al. [32]. Of the 1,565 “core”
genes, only 235 meet this criterion. Alignment of the concatenated amino acid sequences of
those genes with MAFFT and further refinement with Gblock yielded an alignment of ~53,500
sites. A maximum likelihood tree based on this alignment was built by using PhyML and the
LG+G+I model (Fig 2).

The topology of this tree agrees with the widely accepted phylogeny for the Leptospira genus
[4]. However, individual L. interrogans serovars could not be properly separated by using only
this set of genes, as there is still not enough phylogenetic signal. In an attempt to increase the
signal, we repeated this analysis only on L. interrogans serovars, where the number of orthologs
matching the selection criterion increased to 512. The new maximum likelihood tree was built
with an alignment of ~121,000 concatenated sites (Fig 3).
Both trees show that Manilae is likely to be the serovar closest to the ancestral position
within the L. interrogans clade. Suggestion of the relatedness between L. interrogans serovar
Hardjo and the Brem 329 strain of unidentified serovar is supported by their position in the
tree, which is similar to that observed for strains 56601 and IPAV, both of which belong to the
same Lai serovar. The topology also shows that serovar Pyrogenes seems to be more closely
related to Hardjo. Strain FPW2026 is positioned between serovars Manilae and Linhai, and
strain FPW1039 is closer to serovars Pomona and Canicola.
Discussion
Whole genome sequencing allowed us to study the evolutionary relationship of L. interrogans
serovar Hardjo with different serovars of L. interrogans and other species of the Leptospira
genus. The suggested evolutionary position of serovar Hardjo supports the hypothesis that the

components described for serovar Hardjo (see main text). As there was not enough phylogenetic signal to separate individual L. interrogans serovars,
those having this cluster are shaded in pink. Bootstrap values are shown for branches separating different species.

convergence of the rfb loci from L. interrogans serovar Hardjo and L. borgpetersenii serovar
Hardjo are likely to be the consequence of an ancestral lateral gene transfer event, as both are
grouped in separate clades corresponding to their respective species.
Comparison of the genomes of L. interrogans serovar Hardjo strain Hardjoprajitno and L.
interrogans serovar Hardjo strain Norma revealed relatively high sequence conservation,
despite the fact that these strains have very different origins, the first one is a laboratory-
adapted strain sampled from a male patient from Indonesia many years ago, while the second
one is a field isolate recently sampled from infected cattle in Brazil. We found a few structural
rearrangements between the corresponding chromosomes of both strains, which does not
appear to affect protein-coding genes, except for some of them predicted to code for mobile ele-
ment proteins. In fact, most of these rearrangements appear to be flanked by genes predicted to
encode transposases, suggesting that the corresponding mobile elements may have played a
role in their transposition. It is important to mention, however, that these rearrangements may
ultimately be the result of assembly errors, as sequencing was in both cases performed by using
next-generation sequencing techniques and no PCR or other type of experimental validation
was conducted.

Comparisons of the sequenced L. interrogans serovar Hardjo genomes and those of other
Leptospira species also allowed us to identify three relatively large regions present in this sero-
var, with a limited distribution among other Leptospira genomes. Among these regions, the
one containing the gene encoding a PIN domain protein may be reminiscent of an integrated
plasmid, as such proteins and their associated TA operons are commonly found in plasmids
and are thought to play a role in plasmid stability [28]. Furthermore, the region also contains a
gene putatively encoding a plasmid replication initiation factor. The loss of the region from
chromosome I of several other L. interrogans serovars may be explained by a large deletion
event or by its re-excision from the chromosome into a plasmid, a phenomenon that has been
previously described in the species [33].
Another region was found to contain an additional cluster of genes putatively encoding com-
ponents of a tripartite RND transporter system. Like most Gram-negative bacteria, Leptospira
has several genes encoding transporters of the RND superfamily. For example, of all the genes
encoding putative membrane transporters in L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni, 11% appear to
be related to the RND superfamily [14]. In the genome of L. interrogans serovar Lai there are at
least 14 loci predicted to encode the inner membrane exporter protein AcrB, although only two
of these loci have a structure similar to the additional cluster we described for serovar Hardjo.
This particular type is composed of one or two acrB genes, which appear to form an operon with
an acrA gene and a nearby gene encoding a TolC-like protein. Phylogenetic analysis shows that
the genes for this additional cluster may have been acquired by an ancestor close to L. licerasiae
and subsequently lost in some lineages (Fig 2). A phylogenetic tree built with the sequences of
the acrA paralogs confirmed the presence of three clearly different lineages for this gene among
Leptospira genomes (S3 Fig). It has been shown that RND transporters and especially their
increased number of copies are actively involved in the development of drug resistance [34].
Although this analysis is preliminary, the additional copy of this cluster may represent an adap-
tive advantage in those lineages that have maintained the copy during their evolution.
Although functions could not be predicted for the vast majority of genes in these regions, it
is likely that many of them are involved in differences in pathogenicity reported for L. interro-
gans serovar Hardjo and should be the target of future experimental research.
