Abstract
Background: A Cardiac-centered Frailty Ontology can be an important foundation for using NLP to assess patient
frailty. Frailty is an important consideration when making patient treatment decisions, particularly in older adults,
those with a cardiac diagnosis, or when major surgery is a consideration. Clinicians often report patient’s frailty in
progress notes and other documentation. Frailty is recorded in many different ways in patient records and many
different validated frailty-measuring instruments are available, with little consistency across instruments. We
specifically explored concepts relevant to decisions regarding cardiac interventions. We based our work on text
found in a large corpus of clinical notes from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) national Electronic Health
Record (EHR) database.
Results: The full ontology has 156 concepts, with 246 terms. It includes 86 concepts we expect to find in clinical
documents, with 12 qualifier values. The remaining 58 concepts represent hierarchical groups (e.g., physical function
findings). Our top-level class is clinical finding, which has children clinical history finding, instrument finding, and
physical examination finding, reflecting the OGMS definition of clinical finding. Instrument finding is any score found
for the existing frailty instruments. Within our ontology, we used SNOMED-CT concepts where possible. Some of
the 86 concepts we expect to find in clinical documents are associated with the properties like ability interpretation.
The concept ability to walk can either be able, assisted or unable. Each concept-property level pairing gets a
different frailty score. Each scored concept received three scores: a frailty score, a relevance to cardiac decisions
score, and a likelihood of resolving after the recommended intervention score. The ontology includes the
relationship between scores from ten frailty instruments and frailty as assessed using ontology concepts. It also
included rules for mapping ontology elements to instrument items for three common frailty assessment
instruments. Ontology elements are used in two clinical NLP systems.
Conclusions: We developed and validated a Cardiac-centered Frailty Ontology, which is a machine-interoperable
description of frailty that reflects all the areas that clinicians consider when deciding which cardiac intervention will
best serve the patient as well as frailty indications generally relevant to medical decisions. The ontology owl file is
available on Bioportal at http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/CCFO.

Background
Frailty and cardiac decision making
Frailty is an important patient attribute for treatment de-
cisions in general [1–4] because assessing frailty severity
predicts response to treatment and patient outcomes
across many conditions [2, 5–10]. In the modern era of
interventional cardiac care, patient frailty is increasingly
important to decisions regarding major cardiac surgery
and interventional procedures [1, 9, 11]. With the grow-
ing numbers of elderly and diabetic patients [6, 12],
these decisions are common [13]. Older, frail patients
with aortic valve stenosis can now be referred for
coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), a trans-
catheter valve replacement (TAVR), or medical manage-
ment [14–16]. While TAVR is minimally invasive with
shorter length of stay, frail patients may not necessarily
benefit due to non-cardiac illnesses that limit quality of
life or increase risk of procedural complications [11, 17],
including increased length of stay, infection rates, and
re-hospitalization. In 2015, the National Institute on
Aging cited frailty assessment as a key priority in the
perioperative approach to cardiac surgery [13].
Assessing frailty is done by intuitive estimates or ap-
praisals, counting comorbid conditions, and the use of
formal assessment instruments [2, 18, 19]. Frailty can in-
clude physical disability, deficits in mood, sensorium,
and cognition, along with patient experience of pain or
incontinence [3, 6].
The purpose of this paper is to describe the devel-
opment of an ontology of frailty, paying special atten-
tion to how it relates to cardiac care decisions. Our
ontology is designed to access the aspects of frailty
that distinguish it from a simple count of comorbid
conditions. We describe a necessary and sufficient
view of patient frailty indicators apart from comorbid
conditions. This ontology has been designed to allow
computerized extraction of frailty information from
the
narrative
documents
patient
records.
Because
frailty is a topic that is interpreted in many ways and
measured with several instruments [5, 18–20], we
built our ontology using as many term identification
techniques as possible, gathering terms using existent
instruments,
physician
interviews,
and
automated
chart reviews. We aimed to allow cross walking be-
tween the measurement instruments. The hierarchical
structure was adapted from SNOMED-CT [21] but
expanded and informed by the nuances in clinical
decision-making. We tested a draft version of our
ontology
by
creating
instrument-scoring
rules,
by
using it to improve automated detection of frailty in-
dicators in a Natural Language Processing (NLP) sys-
tem, and by using it as an input feature to a system
trained to predict patient mortality after a major car-
diovascular procedure (MCVP) [22].
Frailty and NLP
Given that frailty information is so important, extract-
ing it from clinical records is vital for patient care
and research. The three methods of extracting infor-
mation from clinical records are structured data, hu-
man chart review, or automated NLP systems. There
are 3 reasons why an NLP approach is likely to be
the most successful: 1) physicians do not consistently
use frailty instruments, 2) there is no key, which rec-
onciles scores across instruments, 3) they do not all
use the same definition of frailty.
Clinicians collect frailty information, but not in a
systematic fashion nor by consistently using frailty in-
struments [20]. They document narrative descriptions
of frailty information that they find relevant to the
specific clinical situation. It is possible that since cli-
nicians believe they can rapidly use their clinical judg-
ment to assess a patient’s frailty when they see them
[18], they do not feel the need to systematically use
specific frailty instruments. Their narrative notations
are considered sufficient. However, large-scale retro-
spective studies of patient outcomes require chart re-
view, and if frailty is largely documented in narrative,
then structured text cannot be used and the effort of
wading through text in a chart causes a time bottle-
neck for human reviewers.
The inconsistent use of frailty instruments would not
matter for chart review based on structured information
if there were a method for reconciling scores from dif-
ferent instruments. The method would create equiva-
lences between the instruments. These equivalences
would take as many factors into account as possible.
Creating score equivalence metrics would be a task that
humans would find challenging.
If clinicians all used a similar definition of frailty,
humans chart review or NLP systems without ontology
components would be able to locate their descriptions
easily, but they do not. Clinicians’ ideas about which
patients are frail are influenced by both the culture
within their organizational department, the decision at
hand, and the wider society. For example, departmental
culture may involve specific frailty tests (e.g., 6-min
walk distance) and social culture may mean that frailty
indicators have different thresholds (e.g., low body mass
index (BMI) in Japan vs. the US [23].) Frailty indicators
are also specific to each patient. A patient’s level of mo-
bility is highly dependent on prior exercise activities,
desire for exercise, and the patient’s personal prefer-
ences. The number of frailty instruments that have
been developed evidences the variability in the concep-
tion of frailty, and therefore the complexity of the rela-
tionship between frailty and decision-making. Buta, et
al. [20] identified 67 frailty instruments of which nine
were cited more than 200 times.
Doing-Harris et al. Journal of Biomedical Semantics            (2019) 10:3 
Page 2 of 16
Since current charting practices make human chart
review or using structured data untenable, one could
force a structured data solution by picking a single in-
strument and screen all patients. Picking a single in-
strument and screening everyone is hampered by the
low specificity of current instruments [4, 20] and by
lack of instrument adoption. In addition, frailty assess-
ment varies substantially over time. Assessing all indi-
viduals over time would be necessary to understand the
trajectory and implications of frailty [4], which would
mean that the structured data solution would only be-
come helpful after a significant time-interval. Systemat-
ically conducting frailty assessments at all encounters
would fail to highlight decision-specific frailty issues, it
would add a substantial burden to the clinician, and
cost to the healthcare system.
Ontology building
Ontologies may be used in NLP projects to bridge struc-
tured data fields. Some structured data fields from clin-
ical records across institutions or even within the same
institution use different words to denote the same infor-
mation (e.g., “patient name” vs. “lastname, firstname”)
[24–26]. Ontologies are also used for named entity rec-
ognition and decision modeling [27–29]. For example,
named entity recognition can locate all mentions of dis-
orders that patients may have as well as relevant patient
demographics. Decision modeling uses either the named
entities found or other inputs to access ontological ele-
ments, which contribute to creating rules or other
models of decisions. Our ontology of patient frailty is
designed to fulfill both purposes.
We employed the standard methodology for building
ontologies including reconciling clinical text, medical lit-
erature, and existing ontologies [26, 30–32]. We chose
to develop our ontology by adhering as closely as pos-
sible to realist principles. Realist principles lead to stable
ontologies [33], which can be reasoned with while avoid-
ing illogical inferences [34].
We conceptualized clinical records as textual record-
ings of the author’s ideas about the patient. An existing
ontological concept that corresponds to the author’s
ideas about the patient is clinical finding from the
Ontology of General Medical Science (OGMS), which is
defined as “A representation that is either the output of
a clinical history taking or a physical examination or an
image finding, or some combination thereof.” [35] In
contrast, the definition of a clinical finding used in
SNOMED-CT is “observations, judgments or assess-
ments about patients.” The definition specifies that it is
designed to convey “…the actual state of the body” and
is inclusive of concepts with a semantic tag disorder
(http://browser.ihtsdotools.org/). By referring directly to
the patient’s body and not the clinician’s findings, one is
ignoring consideration of human error, cognitive biases,
and other aspects that may influence patient-clinician
and
clinician-EHR
interactions
[36,
37].
However,
SNOMED-CT’s definition of clinical finding also in-
cludes concepts with the semantic tag finding, which “…
are not separate from the observing of them,” which
brings them closer to the OGMS definition. We re-
stricted ourselves to findings.
Integration with prior work
Two prior studies have successfully mined frailty infor-
mation from rehabilitation and nursing home notes.
One generated International Classification of Function-
ing, Disability and Health (ICF) codes and the other
extracted Barthel index scores [38, 39]. Their work
indicates that it is possible to locate and extract
frailty-relevant terms. We expanded their work by in-
creasing the number of frailty-related terms identified.
The UMLS Metathesaurus [40] contains a complex
structure of frailty-related concepts. It is evident that
SNOMED CT contributes concepts from many, if not all,
of the available frailty instruments. However, the UMLS
Metathesaurus is not realist due to long-standing require-
ments of backward compatibility [33, 41, 42]. We wanted
our ontology to be interoperable with as many other
ontologies as possible. We did not want to create some-
thing that entirely ignored the UMLS Metathesaurus.
Recent papers have discussed realist approaches, specific-
ally with respect to SNOMED-CT [33, 41, 43, 44]. Com-
patibility with SNOMED-CT can be used as a bridge to
the UMLS Metathesaurus. Therefore, we incorporated
SNOMED-CT concepts into the Cardiac-centered Frailty
Ontology as often as possible, but did not limit ourselves
to SNOMED-CT.
Objective
In this study we created a machine-interoperable de-
scription of frailty that reflects all the areas that clini-
cians consider when deciding which cardiac intervention
will best serve the patient as well as general indications
of frailty found in patient records.
Results
In this section we describe each of the four phases of
ontology development (Identify other ontologies and of-
ficial clinical tools, group terms into high-level classes,
define attributes of classes, analyze and validate), which
led to the final ontological structure.
Phase 1 – Collect terms by identifying other ontologies
and official clinical tools
The research team met regularly to iteratively identify
terms from a variety of sources. We reviewed 14 frailty
instruments described in the methods section (below).
Doing-Harris et al. Journal of Biomedical Semantics            (2019) 10:3 
Page 3 of 16
The terms from these instruments were mapped onto
the UMLS meta-thesaurus. If there was a SNOMED-CT
term we used it.
In addition, we interviewed 12 clinicians (cardiologists,
geriatricians, and cardiac surgeons) where we provided 7
hypothetical patient vignettes. Clinicians were asked to
discuss patient frailty in relation to a decision between
CABG, TAVR, and medical management. Each hypothet-
ical patient had a different mix of frailty indicators. The
full study will be described in a separate paper. The
terms found in the interviews included muscle weakness,
oxygen need, gait velocity, 6-min walk distance, volun-
teers, lower extremity strength, robust, functional status,
functionality, deconditioned, acute vs. chronic findings
and BMI. We identified terms at the level of concept
granularity relevant to cardiac decision-making. For ex-
ample, terms relating to housework (e.g., “dusting,”
“washing dishes,” and “vacuuming”) were grouped into a
single concept ability to perform domestic activities be-
cause whether a patient is dusting or vacuuming is not
relevant to their cardiac health.
In order to filter the terms into unique groups to aid
the next step of creating hierarchies, the total set of
terms underwent an initial sorting by the research team
to identify explicit synonyms and concepts. The terms
were found to correspond to the general categories of
toileting, mental health, social functioning, working, ex-
ercise, walking, eating, general health, bathing, dressing
& grooming, transfers, and modifiers (i.e., body locations
and qualifiers). Using these groupings, we had an initial
set of 108 unique concepts.
For those 108 concepts, we identified 198 unique
concept-related terms. Terms within concepts were fur-
ther expanded by SNOMED-CT synonyms and aug-
mented by the team’s previous experience with clinical
documents. After the term expansion, nearly all of the
concepts had either 1 or 2 terms, while one concept had
12 terms. The concept with the most terms was Lack of
energy finding, with “lack of energy,” “tired,” “fatigue,”
“lack energy,” “tiredness,” “sleepiness,” “drowsiness,” “ex-
haustion,” “exhaust,” “wear out,” “drain,” and “weary.”
Our clinician interviews made it clear that clinicians
rely heavily on the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS)
score in assessing patient’s likelihood of surviving sur-
gery. We examined the STS calculation and found it was
more sensitive to comorbid conditions than indications
of frailty. The clinicians also indicated that comorbid
conditions are often included in assessments of patient
frailty. Since we were interested in creating an ontology
of frailty apart from comorbid conditions, we only in-
cluded the concept comorbid conditions count, not spe-
cific conditions the patient might have.
A second term expansion was done using automated
chart review. Terms found included “stagger” as indicative
of the concept impairment of balance finding, “prosthet-
ics,” “shoes,” “gripping strength,” “fatigue,” “weakness,”
“SOB,” “short of breath,” “dyspnea,” “muscle strength,”
“motor strength,” “decreased strength,” “assist,” “para-
lyzed,” “handicap,” “unassisted,” “dresses,” “bathes,” and
“stand.” Some terms were removed because they com-
monly occurred with a meaning alternate to the one we
were after. These terms included “dressing,” “supine,”
“working,” “eating,” “strength,” “incontinence.”
After all terms had been gathered we had 246 terms
associated with the 108 concepts.
Phase 2 – Group terms into high-level concepts
The identified frailty concepts were arranged in hier-
archical relationship by mapping them to SNOMED-CT
equivalents using SNOMED-CT concepts within the cat-
egory clinical finding, with semantic type finding. The
goal for this process was to restrict the SNOMED-CT
mappings to as small a selection as possible, while main-
taining correspondence, which means our ontology is
somewhat compatible with SNOMED-CT.
Figure 1 shows the top concepts in our Cardiac-centered
Frailty Ontology. In order to create an ontology that is
interoperable with SNOMED-CT, it is important that
where concepts in the two ontologies share a name and an
id number they are used to represent precisely the same
portion of reality. Therefore, if we did not match the exact
use described by SNOMED-CT, we explain why and do
not use the SCTID.
As discussed in the introduction, we did not use clin-
ical finding in the same way as SNOMED-CT, we re-
stricted ourselves to the subset with semantic tag
finding. Therefore, we did not use the SNOMED-CT ID
number for the concept clinical finding. Our concept
Clinical finding (CCFOID:1) has children clinical history
finding (CCFOID:11), instrument finding (CCFOID:12),
and physical examination finding (CCFOID:13), reflecting
the OGMS definition of clinical finding. Instrument find-
ing is any score found for the existing frailty instruments
already mentioned. We included classes not mapped to
SNOMED-CT for demographics (CCFOID:14) and quali-
fier values for the properties of our concepts in our top
level.
In the Cardiac-centered Frailty Ontology we included
demographics in clinical findings because we are refer-
ring
to
demographic
information
collected
by
the
clinician at a clinical visit, not to the demographic infor-
mation that inheres in the patient and may change be-
tween visits.
Clinical history finding
The obvious choice for findings arising from the pa-
tient’s clinical history taking is clinical history and obser-
vation finding (finding) (SCTID: 250171008). It turns
Doing-Harris et al. Journal of Biomedical Semantics            (2019) 10:3 
Page 4 of 16
out that all of the children listed in the SNOMED-CT
browser (http://browser.ihtsdotools.org) have semantic
type finding, which is what we were after. Like clinical
finding, we do not want to include all the children of
clinical history and observation finding, which means we
are not referring to the same portion of reality. Syn-
onymous terms and the SNOMED-CT term identifica-
tion number (SCTID) are not necessary because we are
not looking for the concept to be represented in clinical
documents. For these reasons, we shorten the name to
clinical history finding and exclude the SCTID.
The same problem arises when we try to find a
SNOMED-CT equivalent of physical function finding
(CCFOID:112). The topic modeling, our interviews
with clinicians, and existing instruments all indicate
that the patient’s physical abilities are a necessary
category.
The
closest
SNOMED-CT
equivalent
is
functional
finding
(finding)
(SCTID:
118228005),
which has among its children concepts we need, for
example finding of activity of daily living (finding)
(SCTID: 118233009, CCFOID:1124). However, it in-
cludes findings unrelated to physical abilities like does
comply with treatment (SCTID: 386673006). There-
fore, we do not use functional finding and leave phys-
ical function finding, with no SCTID.
SNOMED-CT is so exhaustive that there can be
hierarchical structure that is beyond our needs. Social
and
personal
history
finding
(SCTID:
365448001,
CCFOID:115) has two intervening problem parents
finding by method and history finding, which lead to
clinical finding and not clinical history and observation
finding. There is no indication in the documentation

about how history finding differs from clinical history
and observation finding. The children of Social and
personal
history
finding
and
psychological
finding
(SCTID: 116367006, CCFOID:113) that we are inter-
ested in also have intervening concepts. It may be bet-
ter practice to just use the SCTIDs for the lowest
levels. Those will be the only ones used in the NLP.
Alteration in comfort finding (SCTID: 130979001,
CCFOID:111)
has
the
intervening
parent
problem
sensory
nervous
system
finding
(finding)
(SCTID:
106147001) and neurological finding (finding) (SCTID:
102957003), which go to clinical finding (finding). The
courses qualifier value (CCFOID:43) concept we include
corresponds to the SNOMED clinical finding attribute
clinical course. We also include a concept for seen by a
professional allied to medicine finding because the snip-
pet annotations indicated that being seen by physical
therapy, occupational therapy or other allied professions
indicated patient frailty.
Physical examination finding
We
included
in
Physical
Examination
Finding
(CCFOID:13) concepts that fall in the SNOMED-CT
hierarchy under general findings of observation of patient
(finding) (SCTID: 118222006). In SNOMED-CT general
finding of observation of the patient is a child of clinical
history and observation finding. Since we did not include
observation in our concepts, we included this separate
concept for physically observing the patient. We took a
very restricted subset of the children of general findings of
observation of patient (finding), hence the name change
and absence of SCTID. The children we included are
physical deconditioning finding (SCTID: 31031000119102,
CCFOID:134),
dyspnea
on
exertion
finding
(SCTID:
60845006, CCFOID:131), muscle weakness of limb finding
(SCTID:
713514005,
CCFOID:133),
weight
finding
(SCTID: 107647005, CCFOID:135), and general well-being
finding (SCTID: 365275006, CCFOID:132).
Physical deconditioning has no children. We included
all of the children of muscle weakness of limb because
they separate upper and lower limbs, which our inter-
views indicated is an important distinction. Weight find-
ing has many irrelevant children including finding of
color zone for Broselow Luten pediatric weight estimation
(finding). We did not include these children.
For
dyspnea
on
exertion
finding,
and
General
well-being finding, we kept the SCTID because we could
map all of the children, although this is not currently
part of the ontology. For the children not currently ex-
plicitly listed, we would need to determine whether they
were indicative of high or low frailty. We added the con-
cept comorbid condition count finding (CCFOID:131),
which
we
discussed
earlier,
as
a child
of
general
well-being finding.
The full ontology has 156 concepts, with 246 terms.
The ontology owl file is available on Bioportal at http://
bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/CCFO.
We
con-
sider CCFO a “view” into SNOMED-CT. We define
“view” in accordance with the Ontology Views Project be-
ing done by the Structural Informatics Group at Washing-
ton University (http://sig.biostr.washington.edu/projects/
ontviews/). In this definition a view is a new ontology that
includes some portion of the viewed ontology. CCFO con-
tains portions of SNOMED-CT. It is therefore a view of
SNOMED-CT. As a view, it falls under SNOMED-CT’s
existing
licensure
(https://www.snomed.org/snomed-ct/
get-snomed).
Table 1 shows the number of concepts by their num-
ber of terms. The table lists the number of terms associ-
ated with each of the 86 concepts we expect to find in
clinical documents. The remaining 58 concepts, not in
the table, represent hierarchical groups (e.g., physical
function findings) and 12 qualifier values. Two concepts
from demographics (CCFOID:14) have no terms (patient
age finding, CCFOID:141 and indeterminate sex finding,
CCFOID:1422). Lack of energy finding (CCFOID:132222)
still has the highest number of terms.
Table 2 lists some important concepts and their asso-
ciated terms. The term list is included as Additional file
1. Since terms are not synonyms for the concepts in the
ontology, they are not included in the ontology itself.
Terms are text that we consider indicative of the au-
thor’s thoughts about the concept. Concepts themselves
are portions of reality, not pieces of text.
Phase 3 – Define object properties for concepts
Concept properties were determined by rating scales
used in the instruments. Activities have a frequency
property that is found in the SNOMED-CT frequency
qualifier value (SCTID: 272123002, CCFOID:44) re-
stricted
to
high
frequency
qualifier
value
(SCTID:
27732004, CCFOID:441) and mid-frequency (SCTID:
255218000, CCFOID:442). Frequency values contrast
with a value of absent finding qualifier value (SCTID:
272519000, CCFOID:42). Possible values are restricted
based on the likelihood of finding specific text qualifiers.
Abilities have an ability interpretation property that is
found in ability interpretation qualifier value (SCTID:
371148001, CCFOID:41). These values are also restricted
to able qualifier value (SCTID: 371150009, CCFOID:412),
able with difficulty qualifier value (SCTID: 371157007,

and
unable

(SCTID:
371151008, CCFOID:413). Finally, all clinical findings
have a course property from courses qualifier value
(SCTID:

CCFOID:43),
including
chronic
qualifier value (SCTID: 90734009, CCFOID:431), clinical

qualifier
value
(SCTID:
424572001, CCFOID:432), and sudden onset qualifier
value (SCTID: 385315009, CCFOID:433).
More properties of the concepts were determined
by scores of relevance to cardiac decisions and their
likelihood of resolving after the recommended inter-
vention. Three investigators and three interview par-
ticipants
scored
81
of
the
84
concepts
that
we
expected to find in clinical documents. Three con-
cepts were added after scoring was complete (ability
to drive
a car
finding CCFOID:11241, quadriceps
weakness finding CCFOID:1334, and calf weakness
finding CCFOID:1331).
For the 81 concepts that were scored, ability concepts
were qualified with the able qualifier values (able/inde-
pendent, with difficulty/assisted, and unable/dependent)
each concept-value pair was given a separate score. Ac-
tivity and mental state concepts were qualified with fre-
quency qualifier values (high frequency, mid-frequency,
absent) and scored seperately. Rockwood categories as
described in the Dalhousie University Clinical Frailty
Score [45] were averaged across the eight raters. Ratings
of low, medium, or high for relevance to frailty and
fix-ability where set to the majority rating for the six
raters, who had clinical experience.
Only three concepts were given low relevance to frailty
ratings by all six raters calm finding (CCFOID:113331),
happy finding (CCFOID:113332), and nervous finding

We determined which concepts are specific to cardiac
intervention decisions by using the difference between rat-
ings for will fix and relevance (in Table 3). Will fix refers
to findings the cardiac intervention will alleviate; while
relevance refers to findings that our reviewers indicated
were relevant to frailty. We considered concepts that are
highly relevant to frailty and are either highly likely to be
alleviated by cardiac intervention or are associated with
eventual recovery, to be especially important. For instance,
bed-ridden is seen as generally relevant and not specific-
ally relevant to cardiology. Enjoys light exercise finding
(CCFOID:11231), ability to participate in leisure activities
finding (CCFOID:112412), dyspnea on exertion finding
(CCFOID:131), and fit and well finding (CCFOID:1323)
are all rated as specifically relevant to cardiology as well as
being generally relevant. Thirty-two concepts are rated as
moderately specific to cardiology and 45 were given low
cardiology-specific ratings.
In this section, we also looked at the mapping instru-
ment scores found in the clinical document set to frailty
scores from Rockwood categories as described in the
Dalhousie University Clinical Frailty Score [45]. Table 4
lists the instruments and their scoring criteria.
Phase 4 - analyze and validate
We created implementation rules to map ontology ele-
ments to instrument questions for three common instru-
ments. The rules for these three instruments (Barthel
index, Katz ADLs, and SF-36) are listed in Table 5. Note
that the mappings are not one-to-one. Some of the in-
strument questions were mapped to equivalent concepts.
For example, both Barthel index and Katz ADLs uses
the parent concepts ability to perform personal care ac-
tivities (SCTID: 284774007) to include feeding self,
dressing, grooming, toileting, and washing oneself, and
ability to transfer location (SCTID: 714882001). By cre-
ating implementation rules, we were able to demonstrate
that the Cardiac-centered Frailty Ontology covered the
topics used in the instruments.
In addition, we conducted preliminary NLP analysis
using the ontology. We wanted to determine if narrative
text that included frailty terms also included enough in-
formation
to
determine
whether
the
patient
had
frailty-related functional deficits. Frailty terms from the
Cardiac-centered Frailty Ontology and from a prior
study [46] were used. We extracted 2460 clinical record
snippets centered at the frailty keyword terms. Three

multiple frailty descriptions, the accuracy was deemed to
adequately indicate that the terms in our ontology could
be used to focus a learning system on frailty-relevant
clinical text.
Finally, in [22] we tested whether the ontology could
be used to help train a system to predict mortality for
heart failure patients who underwent a major cardiovas-
cular procedure (MCVP). We collected 2-years of clin-
ical history data for a cohort of 20,000 heart failure
patients leading to the MCVP. Frailty terms were identi-
fied in the text and classified as asserted or negated (i.e.,
“yes deficit” or “other”) using NLP. The ontology was
used to map identified terms to their concepts. This
study used an early draft of the ontology that had only 7
higher-level concepts: therapy, medical findings, exercise,
mobility, living activity, self-care and social function.
These concepts became clinical findings; seen by profes-
sional allied to medicine, physical examination finding,
activity exercise pattern, ability to move, activity of daily
living, eating, feeding drinking ability, and social and
personal history finding, respectively. We aggregated the
frailty concepts by group and selected maximum frailty
score from among the concepts in each group.
A deep neural network (DNN), pictured in Fig. 2, was
trained on a visual representation of the data features,
which were hospitalizations, ICD9 codes for diagnoses,
medications, and the frailty score. In ten-fold cross val-
idation, the area under the curve (AUC) for mortality
prediction was 78.3% (95% CI 77.1 to 79.5%) on the test
data for the DNN model. We view this as additional val-
idation for the ontology.
Discussion
We developed and validated the Cardiac-centered Frailty
Ontology. We created our own hierarchy to allow re-
moval of unnecessary layers, unnecessary concepts, and
maintain realist design principles as much as possible.
We used SNOMED-CT concepts for all of the lowest
level concepts. We incorporated 14 existing instruments
in our initial development. We added five more for scor-
ing and rule sets, when analysis of a 400-document clin-
ical document set showed these instruments were in
common use [20]. We adapted the standard ontology
development model [32] by using clinician interviews to
identify important concepts, without the necessity of for-
cing clinician agreement.
Our ontology development techniques differed from
the
standard
techniques
in
two
ways.
We
used
vignette-guided interviews in lieu of a subject matter
expert meeting to gain consensus and used validated
frailty assessment instruments in lieu of the frailty lit-
erature. Interviews allowed us to determine concepts to
assess patient frailty based on specific clinical decisions.
That our participants came from different institutions
helped minimized institution-related medical-cultural
bias in frailty assessment. By including concepts that
any one group might have excluded, we retain the
chance that our NLP system will find all relevant
Fig. 2 Deep neural network described in Zeng-Treitler, et al., 2018 [22]
Doing-Harris et al. Journal of Biomedical Semantics            (2019) 10:3 
Page 11 of 16
concepts. Since the research group determined the con-
cepts to include, we needed to be sure that we were not
injecting our own opinions. Based on the amount of
previous work in the area and existing SNOMED-CT
concepts we included, we felt that our choices were not
influenced by our opinions. We had our participants
separately rate concepts for frailty severity, chance of
cardiac intervention alleviating the problem, and rele-
vance to frailty. By returning to the participants, we
made explicit the extent and nature of their disagree-
ments.
We
can
then
use
this
information
going
forward.
To address the concepts of frailty related cardiac inter-
ventions specifically; we included the concepts found in
our interviews that we had not found from other
sources. Quadriceps weakness finding is particularly
relevant
to
cardiac
intervention
decisions
because
post-surgical patients cannot use their arms to help
themselves stand. Surgical incisions require the upper
body not be used. Therefore, if the patient cannot stand
using their quadriceps alone, their post-surgical mobility
is impaired, which impedes healing. Our participant rat-
ings show that only a few concepts are specifically rele-
vant to cardiac decisions, while around half are generally
relevant, but not specifically relevant to cardiology. All
four of the cardiac-specific concepts were also consid-
ered highly relevant to general assessments of frailty. As-
sessment of the utility of these cardiac-specific concepts
in predicting patient outcomes was piloted as part of
two studies to predict patient mortality [22, 47].
The Cardiac-centered Frailty Ontology reflects general
frailty assessment as implemented in the frailty instruments
used in its development [2, 48–58]. It includes participant
ratings and our separate analysis of the interview data to
create a picture of clinical decision-making with respect to
cardiac interventions. Based on our orientation toward
surgery-related decision-making [8–11, 13–17], we have
excluded
some
of
the
specificity
required
to
make
non-surgery-related frailty decisions. We grouped all types
of lack of energy findings together even though difference
between “tiredness” and “weariness” may be important in
other contexts. Once we have the NLP system functioning,
it will be important to assess differences in outcome predic-
tion using STS scores, with and without Cardiac-centered
Frailty Ontology concepts.
We used a realist ontology development process [59] be-
cause it appeals to our understanding of the world, it helps
ensure that the ontology is stable, and it avoids illogical
inferences. By separating concept name and term list, we
allow for language evolution, because the way terms are
used changes over time. However, the portions of reality de-
noted by the concept and the concept name do not change.
Concepts refer to Representations in the minds of cli-
nicians. These representations are far richer than the
terms used to indicate their presence in the mind of an
author. Representations are multi-modal. They include
memories and imaginings, relevance to goals, and other
information value attributes.
We are looking for clinical findings, which are conclu-
sions drawn by clinicians and recorded in narrative form
[60]. Restricting ourselves to findings also minimizes
problems with illogical inferences. Take for example the
concept enjoys light exercise finding, the truth of this as
a conclusion drawn by a clinician is unchanged by
whether or not the patient “enjoys” the process of exer-
cising or whether or not the patient actually exercises.
That it is an activity exercise pattern finding also re-
mains a valid inference.
Our main focus was the findings noted in narrative
text documented during clinical care, i.e., clinical his-
tory findings. We recognize that comorbid conditions
are relevant to frailty assessment, but there are exist-
ent tools for identifying comorbid conditions. Clinical
history findings represent the frailty-specific informa-
tion
we
are
interested in
automatically
extracting
from clinical documents. We included a very re-
stricted subset of findings from physical examination.
We tested the comprehensiveness of our coverage by
creating scoring rules for the frailty assessment in-
struments. If concepts were missing, we would not be
able to create appropriate rules. We assessed the rele-
vance of each concept by asking participants to rate
them as high, medium, or low in relevance to asses-
sing frailty with respect to cardiac intervention deci-
sions.
A
preponderance
of
low
relevance
ratings
would indicate a problem. We found only three.
Three quarters of the concepts were rated as highly
relevant. Taken together these results indicate that we
have covered the necessary and sufficient concepts re-
lated to frailty assessment.
One of the best qualities of both SNOMED-CT [21]
and the UMLS Metathesaurus [40] is their exhaustive
coverage of the medical domain. One would be hard
pressed to find a medical concept that was not contained
within them. This exhaustiveness creates problems when
we try to use them in NLP applications. Simple matching
to either vocabulary results in too many false positives.
The Cardiac-centered Frailty Ontology creates a compre-
hensive picture of frailty, while limiting the concepts from
SNOMED-CT to only those directly relevant. We used
concepts, with semantic type finding, found by human re-
view of frailty assessment instruments, physician inter-
views, and chart review.
Limitations
The main limitation of this work is the influence
imparted on the ontology by our own ideas and biases.
This limitation is shared by all ontologies. Our personal
Doing-Harris et al. Journal of Biomedical Semantics            (2019) 10:3 
Page 12 of 16
bias was minimized by the inclusion of the current ac-
cepted validated instruments on frailty. Each instrument
reflects both expert consensus on the relevant concepts
and empirical evidence of validity.
As is the case with all ontology development for NLP,
ontologies precede NLP systems. The clinical outcome
prediction NLP system used in our validation was not
designed to model clinician decision-making. Without
having a decision-making NLP system, it is difficult to
assess whether the Cardiac-centered Frailty Ontology
will facilitate all of the outcome predictions that we
envision.
Conclusions
We developed and validated a Cardiac-centered Frailty
Ontology. The ontology is a machine-interoperable de-
scription of frailty that reflects all the areas that clini-
cians consider when deciding which cardiac intervention
will best serve the patient. It was designed to share as
many elements as possible with SNOMED-CT to allow
interoperability. It could not be simply a subset of
SNOMED-CT because there was no appropriate subset
for us to choose.
Methods
We used the ontology development process described
in Noy, et al. [32]. This process consisted of four
phases. Phase 1 used existing ontologies and official
clinical tools to identify individual terms. The clinical
tools we used were validated frailty instruments and
automated chart review. We expanded this to term
based on physician interviews. In Phase 2 we grouped
terms into high-level concepts. We did this by exam-
ining concepts and hierarchies found in the existing
SNOMED-CT ontology, while keeping the structure
compact and realist. In Phase 3 we defined object
properties for concepts. Our methodology included
mapping concept attributes from scoring collected for
the identified concepts and properties indicated by in-
strument questions. Instruments have an associated
property, which indicates a mapping between instru-
ment scores and our ontology’s concept frailty scores.
For Phase 4, analysis and validation, we created im-
plementation
rules
for
using
the
Cardiac-centered
Frailty Ontology to reconcile scores on three common
frailty instruments. Ontology structure was developed
in Protégé [61], while term mappings were kept and
shared in a Google sheet.
Phase 1 – Aggregate terms form other ontologies and
validated clinical tools
To extract frailty concepts from existing instruments,
five members of the research team reviewed the specific
items from 14 instruments chosen by the number of
times they were cited and expert recommendation [20]:
(1) Physical Frailty Phenotype (PFP, also called CHS
frailty phenotype) [2]; (2) SF-36 [48]; (3) FIM [49]; (5)
Clinical Frailty Scale [50]; (6) Brief Frailty Instrument
[62]; (6) the Barthell Index [51]; (7) Health Assessment
Questionnaire (HAQ) [52]; (8) PSMS [53]; (9) Katz ADL
[54]; (10) Duke Activity Index [55]; (11) RDRS [56]; (12)
FACIT [57]; (13) NYHA [58]; (14) Deficit Accumulation
Index (DAI, also called Frailty Index) [63]. Each person
reviewed each individual item from each instrument.
Terms from the World Health Organization’s Inter-
national Classification of Functioning, Disability and
Health (ICF) were also included in the analysis because
the instruments varied in their levels of abstraction, their
scopes, and uniqueness.
At this step we added an ontology entry for comorbid
condition count. Comorbid conditions are an important
indicator of frailty. However, they are not the focus of
our investigations. We focused on frailty-specific indica-
tors in order to identify core frailty concepts in clinical
documents.
The concept list was expanded by the findings of the
interviews of cardiologist and cardiac surgeons described
above.
Finally, we included terms extracted from manual note
review by members of the research team with clinical
experience. These reviews were in preparation for NLP
topic modeling by Shao, et al., (2016). They reviewed
clinical notes and social media posts [64].
Phase 2 - group terms into high-level concepts
We organized constructs in hierarchical relationship
based on: 1) the results of topic modeling, 2) the
basic organization of the frailty instruments, and 3)
by mapping them to SNOMED-CT equivalents. We
used SNOMED-CT concepts within the category clin-
ical finding, with semantic type finding. The goal for
this process was to restrict the SNOMED-CT map-
pings to as small a selection as possible, while main-
taining correspondence with groupings
from topic
modeling and instruments, which means our ontology
is somewhat compatible with SNOMED-CT.
Phase 3 – Define object properties for concepts
Object
properties
were
determined
in
two
ways,
through the scales used to answer instrument ques-
tions and by scoring terms and concepts based on
key decisions when making cardiac surgery decisions.
For instrument findings, we defined properties, which
related instrument scores to the Rockwood global as-
sessment of frailty (described below) [45].
Rockwood categories are described in the Dalhousie
University Clinical Frailty score, which has 9 categories
Doing-Harris et al. Journal of Biomedical Semantics            (2019) 10:3 
Page 13 of 16
[45]. The categories are (1) very fit, (2) well, (3) man-
aging well, (4) vulnerable, (5) mildly frail, (6) moderately
frail, (7) severely frail, (8) very severely frail, and (9) ter-
minally ill [50]. Concepts in the ontology vary in how
they map onto these severity categories. Some concepts
have
three
levels
of
severity
of
impairment

assisted, and unable). The concept ability to walk, for
example, has these three levels, where each level indi-
cates a different Rockwood category. The scales provided
for question answering in the frailty instruments indi-
cated concept severity levels. These scales took the form
of able to unable and all the time to never.
To establish the relationship of the concepts to
these aspects of frailty three members of the team
(BB, CW, KDH) and 3 participant cardiologists scored
the concepts on three key decisions identified in the
interviews: 1) Rockwood category (described below)
as an indicator of ability to survive surgery, 2) rele-
vance to cardiac decision-making as a reflection of
the patient’s ability to recover from surgery, and 3)
the likelihood that the cardiac intervention will fix
the problem.
Another outcome of our physician interviews was
that clinicians consider indications of frailty within
the context of cardiac decisions by assessing whether
they are likely to be a result of the patient’s cardiac
condition and whether they are specifically relevant to
cardiac decisions. The medically trained members of
this group also characterized the constructs as low,
medium, high for both their likelihood to be fixed by
cardiac intervention and their relationship to cardiac
decision-making.
For instrument scores, we created score rating for 10
commonly cited instruments that were not included in
the initial concept-finding step. The initial mapping was
created by author YC and verified by the remaining
authors.
Phase 4 – Analyze and validate
For this phase, we created rules to implement three frailty
assessment instruments using the Cardiac-centered Frailty
Ontology. We mapped instrument questions and re-
sponses to Cardiac-centered Frailty Ontology concepts
and properties.
We also tested the utility of the ontology in two differ-
ent automated NLP systems. One system was designed
to classify clinical note snippets as indicative or frailty or
not. The other was designed to predict patient mortality
after MCVP.
