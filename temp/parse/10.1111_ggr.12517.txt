200a, VDZ 300a, IAG OPC-1), one limestone (IAG CGL ML-3) and one slate (IAG OU-6) reference materials were selected,
covering a wide range of naturally occurring Sr isotopic signatures. Thirteen laboratories received aliquots of these six reference
materials together with a detailed technical protocol. The consensus values for the six reference materials and their associated
measurement uncertainties were obtained by applying a Gaussian, linear mixed effects model fitted to all the measurement
results. By combining the consensus values and their uncertainties with an uncertainty contribution for potential heterogeneity,
referencevaluesrangingfrom0.708134molmol-1to0.729778molmol-1wereobtainedwithrelativeexpandeduncertainties

considered and the compatibility of measurement results obtained by MC-ICP-MS and by MC-TIMS is demonstrated. The
materials characterised in this study can be used as reference materials for validation and quality control purposes and to
estimate measurement uncertainties in conventional 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratio measurement.

Comparability and reliability realised by quality control
and by applying metrological concepts are the most
important attributes especially for chemical and geochem-
ical
measurement
results.
For
this
purpose,
reference
materials (RMs) are of utmost relevance, as they ensure the
highest metrological quality of the measurand to be applied
for validating the analytical procedure, determining the
measurement uncertainty, and obtaining traceability of the
measurement results (Irrgeher and Prohaska 2015a). Appli-
cations of isotope ratio analysis require isotope certified
reference materials (iCRMs) either for correction of instru-
mental isotope fractionation (IIF), usually, but incorrectly
called mass bias, for method validation, for quality control or
for providing traceability to an internationally accepted basis
(Vogl and Pritzkow 2010, Vogl et al. 2013). Consequently,
iCRMs are essential for all isotope ratio measurements to
obtain traceable (to the international system of units or
internationally accepted standards) and thus comparable
isotope results (Vogl et al. 2013). We distinguish two types of
iCRMs, namely primary iCRMs to be used for calibrating
absolute isotope ratios and/or anchoring delta scales and
matrix-matched iCRMs. Besides the need for primary iCRMs
essential for correction and calibration of IIF, matrix-matched
iCRMs are of increasing importance in validation of
analytical procedures and quality control due to the similarity
of the sample matrix. Due to the lack of suitable matrix-
matched
iCRMs
and
concurrent
needs
of
the
user
community in the past, a number of reference samples were
selected by the community, analysed, and isotope ratio data
reported. These data were then compiled in specific
publications (Brand et al. 2014) or in databases such as
GeoReM (Jochum et al. 2005). While quite useful, these
data provide a consensus value for a specific isotope ratio
only without evaluating possible measurement biases or
uncertainty components attributable to the measurement
itself, instrument employed, material instability, or heteroge-
neity. With each new publication or new issue of the
database,
such
data
are
subject
to
change
(Vogl
et al. 2019). Interlaboratory comparisons (ILCs) can bridge
the gap between the scarcity or unavailability of iCRMs and
the available but continuously changing values of data-
bases by providing tailor-made suitable matrix materials.
The results of ILCs can contribute to uncertainty evaluation or
validation of the analytical procedure at the participants’
laboratory, while remaining units of the matrix material
applied in the ILC might become a reference material.
In the natural sciences and industrial applications, the
demand for Sr isotope ratio data as an analytical tool keeps
growing. Sr isotope ratios are essential tracers used for solving
various problems in different scientific fields rather than in
classical geology and geochemistry, including archaeology
and anthropology (Bentley 2006), food forensics (Voerkelius
et al. 2010, Trincherini et al. 2014) and material provenance
(Brilli et al. 2005, Henderson et al. 2015, Boschetti et al. 2017,
Hoogewerff et al. 2019), as well as environmental studies
(Harmon et al. 2016, Nakano 2016). A major part of Sr
isotope analysis is focused on the determination of the
radiogenic 87Sr, more specifically the 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratio,
for Rb-Sr dating of rocks or for provenance or authentication
studies (Brand et al. 2014). The 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratio of a
sample is typically measured using either multi collector
thermal ionisation mass spectrometry (MC-TIMS), multi-
collector inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry
(MC-ICP-MS) or even single collector ICP-MS with or without
Sr-matrix separation. Incomplete digestion opens only a part
of the Sr reservoirs in a sample to the measurement procedure
and thus may lead to biased 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios. The
determination of 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios using any of these
instrumental techniques suffers from IIF as well as from
interferences and matrix-related effects – if present and
remain uncorrected for. IIF is corrected for by applying an
iCRM being certified for its 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratio such as NIST
SRM 987 to calculate correction factors or carry out isotope
delta measurements (Irrgeher and Prohaska 2015b). The
most frequently used approach for correcting IIF in Sr isotope
ratio measurements, however, is the so-called conventional
method for 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios. This approach is based on
the correction of the measured 87Sr/86Sr ratio by applying a
correction factor for IIF, which was obtained from the
measured 86Sr/88Sr ratio, and the conventional 86Sr/88Sr
ratio set at 0.1194 mol mol-1 (Nier 1938, Steiger and
J¨ager 1977) by using the exponential law or the power law
(Vanhaecke and Kyser 2012). In either case, adequate
digestion procedures are a prerequisite to avoid analyte loss
due to incomplete digestion or precipitation, which may
scavenge a non-negligible proportion of the analyte. Even
after Sr purification, substantial parts of the matrix may remain
or might be formed due to column bleeding which then may
affect the 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios due to matrix-induced
interferences, signal instability, signal suppression and IIF drift
(Irrgeher et al. 2013, Fourny et al. 2016, Zimmermann
et al. 2019). These matrix-related effects and those caused by
unsuitable digestion procedures may lead to a bias in the
87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios (Fourny et al. 2016). Therefore, the
analysis of well-characterised matrix-matched RMs is essential
to validate the analytical procedure (including digestion,
purification, and measurement) for the selected analyte-matrix
combination, as well as to enable quality control measures.
Reports of reference values for 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios in
geological materials are limited to a handful of publications,
mostly focused on
87Sr/86Sr isotope characterisation of
silicate rock reference materials (Raczek et al. 2003, Balcaen

et al. 2010, Fourny et al. 2016, Jo et al. 2021) and in one
case sediments (Chauvel et al. 2011). In other fields,
especially those of construction chemistry and cementitious
materials, matrix-matched reference materials with charac-
terised 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios are lacking although heavily
needed to validate analytical procedures used for prove-
nance studies of these cementitious materials, especially
cement, mortar, and concrete (Graham et al. 2000, Kazlagic
et al. 2021, Kazlagi´c et al. 2022), and for possible
technological procedures during renovation of historical
objects.
Therefore,
an
ILC
was
organised
to
characterise
87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios in cement, limestone, and slate
reference materials. This ILC study is focused on industrial
and related geological reference materials, with four of six
reference
materials
being
cements.
Even
though
the
limestone and slate reference materials included in this
study are not used specifically to produce the cement
materials used in this study, they have very similar matrices to
raw materials used for the cement production. Their
87Sr/86Sr isotopic characterisation is deemed useful for
quality control assessment in geochemical as well as
technical applications. The main objective of this ILC is to
provide the scientific community with assigned reference
values for the conventional 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratio of three
different types of geological and industrial materials that can
be used as matrix-matched RMs for validation and quality
control. A secondary objective is to evaluate any difference in
the application of MC-TIMS and MC-ICP-MS for determin-
ing conventional 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios.
Study design and mandatory measurand
Study layout
Thirteen international laboratories were invited to partic-
ipate in this study to determine the conventional 87Sr/86Sr
isotope ratios of six powdered cement or rock RMs of which
10 g each were provided. These laboratories were selected
based on their demonstrated ability to perform metrologically
valid isotope ratio measurements
or based on their
demonstrated specific experience in conventional 87Sr/86Sr
isotope ratio determinations. Together with the set of bottled
and packed reference materials, all participants received a
technical protocol and a reporting template (Electronic
Supplementary Material ESM). The technical protocol con-
tained detailed guidelines, which were mandatory for the
participants. First, the minimum number of digestions was set
to two digestions per reference material with a minimum
sample amount of 100 mg per digestion. Second, partic-
ipants were asked to perform a complete digestion of the
reference material. Third, Sr needed to be separated from the
matrix preferably via chromatographic means to remove
interfering Rb and matrix elements with reporting Sr recovery
and procedural Sr blanks. Fourth, 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios
measurements had to be determined by using MC-ICP-MS
or MC-TIMS. Additionally, one measurement of the certified
isotope reference material NIST SRM 987 (Sr carbonate
isotopic standard, NIST, Maryland, USA) was requested per
MC-ICP-MS sequence or MC-TIMS turret, at least three
measurements in total. Fifth, 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratio measure-
ments needed to be carried out following the conventional
87Sr/86Sr isotope ratio method as described below. Finally,
participants were asked to report any additional quality
control measures they carried out, such as conventional
87Sr/86Sr isotope ratio measurement of reference samples or
quality control samples.
Mandatory measurand - conventional 87Sr/86Sr
isotope ratio
According to ISO 17034 an operationally defined
measurand is a "measurand that is defined by reference to
a widely accepted measurement procedure to which only
results obtained by the same procedure can be compared"
(ISO 2017). Furthermore, the International Vocabulary of
Metrology defines a conventional quantity value as a
"quantity value attributed by agreement to a quantity for a
given purpose" (BIPM et al. 2012). Based on these two
definitions, the commonly determined 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratio
with internal IIF correction completely fulfils the requirements
of an operationally defined measurand and is termed
‘conventional
87Sr/86Sr isotope ratio’ with the quantity
symbol Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) and the unit mol mol-1. Even though
results obtained with the conventional 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratio
method are not traceable to the International System of Units
(SI), the unit mol mol-1 applies here, because Rcon(87Sr/86Sr)
is an isotope ratio relating a method defined amount of 87Sr
to
a
method-defined
amount
of
86Sr.
Values
of
Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) are traceable to the conventional 87Sr/86Sr
isotope ratio method provided all steps of the method are
followed and an uncertainty budget is available.
The internationally agreed-upon guidelines for obtaining
conventional 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios are described in the
following. The measurement method basically relies on
the application of mass spectrometry (in most cases MC-
TIMS or MC-ICP-MS) and the internal (within the sample
measurement) correction of IIF (also known as mass bias) of

the measured 87Sr/86Sr ion intensity ratio via the measured
86Sr/88Sr ion intensity ratio, whereby the 86Sr/88Sr isotope
ratio is set by convention to exactly 0.1194 mol mol-1
(Nier 1938, Steiger and J¨ager 1977). The IIF is obtained by
dividing the set value R(86Sr/88Sr) = 0.1194 mol mol-1 by
the measured 86Sr/88Sr ion intensity ratio and applying it to
correct the measured 87Sr/86Sr ion intensity ratio by using
the
exponential
law
or
the
power
law
(Hart
and
Zindler 1989, Habfast 1998). Here, the application of the
exponential law (Hart and Zindler 1989) and the use of the
atomic weight of the isotopes obtained from the Atomic
Mass Evaluation 2020 (Wang et al. 2021) are preferred.
This step is the main difference of the conventional 87Sr/86Sr
isotope ratio to the absolute isotope ratio n(87Sr)/n(86Sr),
because stable 86Sr/88Sr isotope variations are obliterated
by the internal IIF correction, and an insufficiently accurate
value for the 86Sr/88Sr isotope ratio is used.
Furthermore, the 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratio of NIST SRM 987
determined by the conventional method is widely accepted to
be Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) = 0.71025 mol mol-1 (Faure and Men-
sing 2013, McArthur et al. 2006), in contrast to the certified
value n(87Sr)/n(86Sr) = (0.710 34  0.000 26) mol mol-1
(NIST 2007), which represents an absolute isotope ratio or
isotope amount ratio. The difference in these values is
obvious because they represent two different quantities of
one material, on one side Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) and on the other
side the certified n(87Sr)/n(86Sr). In addition, more than 1900
published results listed in the GeoReM database up to
2019 for Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) of NIST SRM 987 yield a median
value with an associated expanded uncertainty (k = 2) of
(0.710 250  0.000 001) mol mol-1 (GeoReM 2019), which
confirms the above stated value. Therefore, whenever a
significant bias (beyond the measurement precision) between
the measured value of NIST SRM 987 and the conventional
isotope ratio Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) = 0.710 250 mol mol-1 = 0.710
250 mol mol-1 was detected, it was recommended to use this
value to obtain a final correction factor to be consequentially
applied
to
all
(sample)
measurement
results.
Such
a
final correction factor may compensate for remaining bias
(es) caused for example by differences in the detector
efficiencies.
By following the exactly prescribed procedure described
above and by calculating associated measurement uncer-
tainties, traceability to the internationally agreed convention
method is established and comparability between all
measurement results obtained by the convention method is
thus enabled. It has to be noted here that neither the
conventional
87Sr/86Sr
isotope
ratio
method
nor
the
absolute Sr isotope ratio method is preferred over the other,
but both methods are valid having their specific pros and
cons. In this work, however, the focus is on the application of
the conventional 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratio method.
Materials
Six different powdered RMs were selected for this study,
four cement materials and two rock materials (limestone and
slate) representing two potential raw materials of cement, i.e.,
limestone and siliceous clay or marl. A description of each
RM can be found below. More details are available
following the cited references. All six materials are RMs
designed to be used for validation and quality control
purposes in quantitative analysis of major and trace
elements therein. Upon arrival of all reference materials to
the pilot laboratory, they were opened unit by unit and
transferred into smaller pre-cleaned PP-bottles, in batches of
approximately 10 g of RM per bottle, so that each bottle can
be tracked back to the original RM unit. Each bottle was
labelled with the original RM’s name, the original unit
number and the sub-unit number, which corresponds to the
lab ID. Thereafter each bottle was sealed in polyethylene-
aluminium-composite foil bags and bottles with identical
sub-unit numbers were sorted to sets of six bottles containing
one bottle of each reference material. After completing this
step, the sample sets were shipped to the participants.
IAG/CGL ML-3 is a powdered limestone from Mongo-
lia, which has been blended before homogenisation with a
small amount of clay to increase the silica and trace
elemental contents. The material contains mainly calcite with
a few percent each of magnesite, quartz and albite and
trace amounts of muscovite, amphiboles, and magnetite
(IAG 2016). The material was certified in a joint project
between the International Association of Geoanalysts (IAG)
and the Central Geological Laboratory of Mongolia for
several elemental mass fractions (major as well as trace
elements). The strontium mass fraction in the certified
reference material with its associated expanded uncertainty
(k = 2) is: w(Sr) = (1018  30) mg kg-1.
IAG OPC-1 is an ordinary Portland cement, which was
produced by PPC Ltd., Republic of South Africa. The material
was used in the GeoPT scheme round 26 run by IAG, where
the reference values and information values of many major
and trace elements resulted from (IAG 2015). The strontium
mass fraction in the reference material with its associated
expanded uncertainty (k = 2) is: w(Sr) = (118.2  2.1)
mg kg-1 (IAG 2015).

metamorphism. The slate is homogenous except for occa-
sional green reduction spots and crystals of pyrite (IAG 2020).
The material was used in the GeoPT scheme round 9 run by
IAG, where the reference values and information values of
many elements resulted from (Kane 2004). The OU-6
material was certified by the IAG for elemental mass fractions.
The strontium mass fraction in the certified reference material
with its associated expanded uncertainty (k = 2) is: w(Sr) =
(132  2) mg kg-1 (IAG 2020).
VDZ100a is a Portland cement (CEM I 42,5 R), which was
characterised for several elemental mass fractions in an
interlaboratory comparison run by the Association of German
Cement producers (Verein Deutscher Zementwerke e.V.,
D¨usseldorf, Germany (VDZ)). The strontium mass fraction in
the reference material with its associated expanded uncer-
tainty (k = 2) is: w(Sr) = (1107  50) mg kg-1 (VDZ 2022a).
VDZ200a is a Portland-composite-cement (CEM II/B-M
(S, LL 32.5 R), which was characterised for several elemental
mass fractions in an interlaboratory comparison run by the
Association of German Cement producers (VDZ). The
strontium mass fraction in the reference material with its
associated expanded uncertainty (k = 2) is: w(Sr) = (1922
 394) mg kg-1 (VDZ 2022b).
VDZ300a is a blast furnace cement (CEM III/B 42.5 N
LH/SR/NA), which was characterised for several elemental

strontium mass fraction in the reference material with its
associated expanded uncertainty (k = 2) is: w(Sr) = (811

Applied methods and procedures
Analyticalproceduresandparticipatinglaboratories
All procedures such as weighing, sample dissolution and
Sr separation were performed in a clean laboratory
environment in the participants’ laboratories. Procedural
blanks for Sr as reported by the majority of the laboratories
range from less than 2.7 ng down to 0.006 ng. Two
laboratories did not report a procedural blank. Sample
decomposition was realised either by acid digestion carried
out in closed Teflon vials on a hot plate and using various
acid mixes, assisted by microwave, or using a digestion
bomb or by flux fusion (LiBO2). The amount of sample used
for each independent sample preparation ranged between
100 mg and 600 mg. Subsequent isolation of Sr was
carried out using either a cationic ion exchange resin (e.g.,
BioRad AG 50W X8) or extraction chromatographic resins
(e.g., Sr Spec or DGA, both Triskem). Both manual as well as
automated procedures for Sr separation were performed by
the participants. More details on the applied analytical
procedures,
including
exact
sample
masses
used for
dissolution, sample digestion protocols, reagents used, ion
exchange chemistry and recovery of Sr during the matrix
separation, can be obtained from the online supporting
information Appendix S1.
The thirteen participating laboratories produced a total of
102 measurement results for the six reference materials, each
result comprising a measured value of Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) and an
evaluation of the associated measurement uncertainty. Three
laboratories (BAM, IA and MUL) performed measurements
using both MC-ICP-MS and MC-TIMS. USGS provided
measurement results obtained by two different MC-ICP-MS
instruments (Nu Plasma 3 and a Nu Plasma 1). All other
participants used either MC-ICP-MS or MC-TIMS. Hence, for
each material seventeen compound results were obtained.
Additionally, most of the laboratories provided data on quality
control (QC) materials analysed in parallel to the ILC
reference materials. To enable an evaluation of the QC
measurements, reference values were calculated as the
median with the associated expanded measurement uncer-
tainty of all data listed in GeoReM as of 14 September 2022.
Metrological compatibility between measured and reference
values was assessed by calculating the so-called normalised
error (En). The mathematical background is presented in
Equations (1) to (3), where xi and xref represent the measured
and the reference value, di represents the difference of both
values, u represents the corresponding standard uncertainties,
U the expanded uncertainty and cov represents the
covariance. Consequentially, two values are metrologically
compatible, when their associated En value is ≤1.

ratios Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) for QC materials are metrologically
compatible with the reference values. This demonstrates that
the applied analytical procedures are validated.
Statistical evaluation and value assignment
Comparability of the data: ILC studies in measurement
science have the task to compare measurement results
obtained independently and to produce a consensus value
for the common measurand that combines the values
measured by the participants (Koepke et al. 2017). The
requirements for such a comparison are that all performed
measurements were traceable tothe same sourceor reference,
which in turn requires measurement uncertainties associated
with the measurement results. Both requirements are fulfilled for
this study, as all results were accompanied by an uncertainty
estimate and are traceable to the conventional method for
87Sr/86Sr isotope ratio measurements as described above.
All participants of this ILC study were asked to provide a
measurement uncertainty for each final result submitted.
Three laboratories have their own strategies available
for
calculating
the
measurement
uncertainties
for
Rcon(87Sr/86Sr), which will be explained in the following.
Laboratories which had no specific approach for calculating
the measurement uncertainty used the calculation approach
of Lab 15 (BAM).
Lab 06 (MUL) calculated the uncertainty budget for
Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) of the six RMs measured using MC-ICP-MS
after flux fusion (LiBO2) using a Kragten approach according
to the protocol of Horsky et al. (2016). Here, the Sr procedure

d Expanded measurement uncertainty obtained as two-times the median of the absolute deviations, 2xMADE (CCQM 2013).
e For the material BR only two exactly equal values, 0.703 890 mol mol-1, are listed, which do not allow an uncertainty estimate. Therefore, the median of the
expanded uncertainties (0.000 007 mol mol-1) of the here used reference samples is taken instead.
f For the material COQ-1 two values exist, which does not allow the calculation of the median and the MADE. Therefore, the half of the absolute difference
between both values was taken as u.
g For the material NASS-6 only one entry exists in GeoReM with a value of 0.709 179 mol mol-1, which does not enable an uncertainty calculation. NASS-6 and
IAPSO are both seawater from the open North Atlantic Ocean. Therefore, the IAPSO value of (0.709 178  0.000 007) mol mol-1 can be used instead,
because open Ocean seawater shows homogenous Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) values.

blank, the Rb correction, the precision of the 86Sr/88Sr and
87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios of the sample, as well as the within-
run-repeatability of Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) of repeatedly measured
NIST SRM 987 as proxy for instrument stability were
considered as main contributors to the uncertainty budget.
In addition, the Nordtest approach according to N¨aykki
et al. (2012) was applied as an uncertainty estimation for
Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) of the six RMs measured using MC-ICP-MS
after flux fusion (LiBO2). To this end, the result of the QC
sample (BHVO-2) was used and its within-laboratory
reproducibility (intermediate measurement precision accord-
ing to BIPM et al. 2012) and its method bias were
considered as main contributors to the uncertainty. Both, the
bottom-up Kragten and the top-down Nordtest approach
resulted in comparable relative uncertainties of about 0.014
% (Urel, k = 2) which was mainly the result from the blank
contribution of the fusion material (LiBO2).
Lab 11 (PTB) used a kind of holistic approach, within which
all measured ratios were combined for the final value q and its
associatedmeasurementuncertaintyu q
ð Þ.Thefinalvalueq was
calculated as the mean of Nk × Nj × Ni = 3×4×10 = 120
single valuesqk,j,i. The singlevalueswereacquiredwithintwelve
sequences(Nk= 3aliquotswithNj= 4sequencesperaliquot).
Within each sequence Ni = 10 values were measured. To
denote the aliquot the index k, to denote the particular
sequence the index j, and to denote the single measurement
within a sequence the index i were used. The combined
uncertainty u q
ð Þ associated with the final value was calculated
according to eqn. 4, which basically sums up the mean
uncertainty within a sequence and the uncertainty between
sequences (Henrion 1998), neglecting any homogeneity
contributions (cf. figure S1 in the ESM).
Please note that every single value of the ten within a
single
sequence

calculated

thirty
integration cycles (2 s each) plus the adjacent 2 × 30

Lab 15 (BAM) applied a straightforward and pseudo
top-down
approach
for
calculating
the
measurement
uncertainties for Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) measurements which is
based on eqn. 5. This uncertainty evaluation is based on
the principles as found in the Guide to the Expression of
Uncertainty in Measurement (BIPM et al. 2008). The

Tests showed that when using the approaches of either
Lab 06 and Lab 15, or Lab 11 and Lab 15, with the same
input data, similar measurement uncertainties are obtained.
The final laboratory values consisting of Rcon(87Sr/86Sr)
for each ILC material and their associated measurement
uncertainties (calculated as described above) are the input
data (Table 2) for the statistical evaluation. All data within this
study are presented with six significant digits to enable a
better readability and comparability of the values for the
reader, although it is known that it violates the GUM
guideline (BIPM et al. 2008) of presenting two significant
digits of the uncertainty to some extent.
The statistical model: The consensus values for the six
RMs in this study are based on a Gaussian, linear mixed
effects model fitted to all the measurement results, with fixed
effects for the materials and the type of the measuring
instrument (MC-TIMS or MC-ICP-MS), and with random
effects for the participating laboratories (Pinheiro and
Bates 2000). The modelling choice made for the partic-
ipants’ effects regards them as representative of the
community of expert laboratories that are capable to
measure this isotope ratio with a comparable reliability.
The laboratory effects are modelled as Gaussian
random variables with 0 as the mean and standard
deviation τ (often called "dark uncertainty" (Thompson
and Ellison 2011) because it becomes apparent only once
results obtained by different laboratories working indepen-
dently are compared). The estimate of τ is small but
significantly different from 0 according to a likelihood ratio
test performed using the facilities provided by R (R Core
Team 2022) package RLRsim (Scheipl et al. 2008): it
amounts to 27 % of the median of the reported uncertainties
for Rcon(87Sr/86Sr).
The dark uncertainty can be interpreted as the "extra"
uncertainty that is required to make the results mutually
consistent. The sole material for which the measurement
results exhibit marginally significant dark uncertainty is IAG
OPC-1 (the corresponding p-value, when the presence of
dark uncertainty is tested separately for each material, is
0.046). The standard deviation of the measured values of
the isotope ratio for this material is 0.000 052 mol mol-1,
while the median of the standard uncertainties reported
by the participating laboratories is 0.000 041 mol mol-1.
This means that the measured values are more dispersed
than their "typical" reported uncertainty suggest that they
should be. The "excess" dispersion, expressed in mol
mol-1, can be naively quantified thus: sqrt(0.0000522 -
0.0000412) = 0.000032. In our statistical model, which
takes the results for all materials into account simulta-
neously,

Similarly to what was noted above for the material-

"average" across all materials with the material-specific
estimates of τ likely be different. The model was fitted using R
function
"lmer"
defined
in
package
"lme4"
(Bates

Figure 1, QQ-plot of the residuals and plot of the residuals
against the fitted values, reveals somewhat excessive
heaviness of the tails of the probability distribution of the
residuals, and suggests some heterogeneity of the dispersion
of the residuals for the different materials.

uncertainties, and 95 % confidence intervals for their true

linear, and that "lab" is a random effect. The model was
fitted using the restricted maximum likelihood criterion (REML)
(Pinheiro and Bates 2000). The laboratory (random) effects
were evaluated using facilities provided by R package
"merTools" (Knowles and Frederick 2020).
Results and discussion
Reported 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios Rcon(87Sr/86Sr)
and associated uncertainties
In total the thirteen participating laboratories reported
seventeen datasets and 102 Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) measurements
for the six investigated RMs using the provided Excel
template. The result together with their associated standard
uncertainties are listed in Table 2, while all other data and
metadata can be found in Appendix S1.
The observed spread of the reported results for each
material expressed as the standard deviation s ranges
around 0.000 010 mol mol-1 except for IAG OPC-1 and
OU-6 where it is 0.000 052 mol mol-1 and 0.000 031 mol
mol-1, respectively. Likewise, the reported standard uncer-
tainties for these materials ranging between 0.000 007 mol
mol-1 and 0.000 125 mol mol-1 are larger as well,
compared with the other materials where they range
between values of 0.000 005 mol mol-1 and 0.000 021
mol mol-1. The exception here is laboratory 6 MUL (I) with
standard uncertainties from 0.000 045 mol mol-1 to 0.000
062 mol mol-1, which could easily be explained by the
applied flux fusion (LiBO2) for digesting the samples and the
related high procedure blank. The larger spread of the
results and the greater standard uncertainties for IAG OPC-
1 and OU-6 point to additional difficulties with the sample
material such as a potential heterogeneity or increased
difficulty in achieving complete digestion. A few of the
participating laboratories digestion procedures have been
optimised in terms of time and acid combinations to realise
complete sample digestion of IAG OPC-1 and OU-6.
Great care must be taken when applying standard
digestion procedures without further testing for these two
materials.
Further statistical data analysis is carried out in the
following subsections focussing on three main questions: (a)
Is there a statistically significant difference between MC-ICP-
MS and MC-TIMS reported data? (b) Do laboratory effects
differ significantly from 0 (is there any statistically significant
dark uncertainty)? (c) What are the consensus values, and
associated uncertainties for the six RMs?
Comparison of MC-ICP-MS and MC-TIMS and
assessment of laboratory effects
To evaluate a significant difference between the measure-
ments made using MC-ICP-MS and MC-TIMS (question (a)),
the mean values of both techniques were calculated across the
six RMs. The means, over all materials and laboratories,
consistent with the model, are 0.715 031 mol mol-1 (with a
standard uncertainty u = 0.000 002 mol mol-1 on five degrees
of freedom) for MC-ICPMS, and 0.715 035 mol mol-1
(u = 0.000 003 mol mol-1 on six degrees of freedom) for
MC-TIMS. These degrees of freedom were computed using the
Kenward-Roger method (Length 2022). The standardised
difference between these means has an absolute value 1.07
on 10.6 effective degrees of freedom, computed using the
Welch-Satterthwaite approximation (BIPM et al. 2008, Annex
G.4). The corresponding p-value is 0.3, suggesting that the
difference does not differ significantly from 0. Therefore, this
result shows that there is no statistically significant difference
between themeasurements madeusingMC-ICP-MS andMC-
TIMS when they are compared across all six RMs. Alternatively,
the mean values for MC-ICP-MS and MC-TIMS can be
calculated for each material with their associated measure-
ment uncertainties. Theabsolutedifferencesbetween the mean
values of MC-TIMS and MC-ICP-MS are equal to or less than
0.000 006 mol mol-1 for IAG CGL ML3, VDZ-100a, VDZ-
200a, and VDZ-300a, while they are 0.000 016 mol mol-1 for
IAG OPC-1 and 0.000 026 mol mol-1 for IAG OU-6. For all six
RMs, however, the individual normalised errors En for the
comparison of MC-ICP-MS with MC-TIMS (for each material)
are significantly below 1. Thus,
87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios
Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) for the six RMs are metrologically compatible,
in other words indistinguishable and equally valid, regardless
of whether it was determined by MC-ICP-MS or MC-TIMS.
To answer the question (b), the estimated laboratory effects
and their 95 % expanded uncertainties were compared
against 0 mol mol-1, as depicted in Figure 2. Here, the effect for
Lab 05 differs significantly from 0 mol mol-1, indicating that this
laboratory tended to measure "low" on average. However,
this effect is less than 0.000 015 mol mol-1 in absolute value.
Laboratory-specific effects are attributable to differences in the
sample preparation techniques, in Sr separation methods,
and in procedures for correcting the data outputs. No other
laboratory effects could be observed. Sample heterogeneity
may influence the laboratory effects as well.

uncertainties and dark uncertainties are presented in Figure 3.
The assigned consensus values of the
87Sr/86Sr ratios
Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) for all materials with associated standard
uncertainties (question (c)) were obtained as described in the
section ‘The statistical model’ and plotted in Figure 3. For IAG
CGL ML-3, VDZ 100a, VDZ 200a, and VDZ 300a excellent
agreement was realised at the level of the standard
uncertainties. For IAG OPC-1 and IAG OU-6 the spread of
resultsis significantly larger, pointing to potentialdifficulties with
complete sample digestion and/or sample heterogeneity.
However, good agreement was achieved for the majority of
the labs at the level of the expanded uncertainties (U, k = 2).
Since
the
statistical
model
was
fitted
to
all
the
measurement results together, it produces estimates of the
consensus
values
for
the
87Sr/86Sr
isotope
ratio
Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) that are specific to each RM but average
the measured values over the two types of instruments which
have no significant differential effects. The model also
exploits
information
on
the
differential
effects
of
the
laboratories by averaging them across all RMs. If the same
model was fitted to the measurement results for each
material separately, the consensus values likely would be
slightly different from those listed above, and the uncer-
tainties slightly larger. The assigned standard uncertainties
for the consensus values of the RMs range from 0.000 002
mol mol-1 to 0.000 009 mol mol-1.
The assigned consensus values for the 87Sr/86Sr isotope
ratios Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) for all RMs with their associated
standard uncertainties are listed in Table 3. These results
are based on a model fitted to all the measurement results;
hence they are averaged over the two types of applied
measurement
instruments,
which
have
no
significant
differential effects. The entries "lower endpoint" and "upper
endpoint" (Table 3) are the lower and upper endpoints of
the 95 % confidence intervals for the consensus values.
Furthermore, the standard uncertainty and the interval for
IAG OPC-1 were computed using the statistical bootstrap
via resampling of the model residuals (Davison and
Hinckley 1997). More information, e.g., single measurement
values reported by the participants is listed in Appendix S1.
Comparison with other studies
Based on the literature record no known ILC or
proficiency testing for Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) has been published.
This includes no metrologically sound comparison of MC-
ICP-MS
with
MC-TIMS
on
87Sr/86Sr
isotope
ratios
Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) has yet to be conducted. Additionally, Sr
isotope data are generally compared with published
Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) data of RMs commonly used for QC in
geochemistry, although the data were typically generated
not following a sufficiently well-documented procedure
concerning metrological principles nor were they reported
with an uncertainty estimate including all relevant uncertainty
contributions. A large proportion of publications report
87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) but does not explicitly
state the specific difference to absolute n(87Sr)/n(86Sr)
isotope ratios or do not present a data evaluation approach
for
87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) (see above:
Mandatory measurand - conventional
87Sr/86Sr isotope
ratio). If no detailed statement or methodology regarding
Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) data is provided in a publication, it can be
assumed that those data are achieved by internal correction
using R(86Sr/88Sr) = 0.1194 mol mol-1; however, the use of
the reference value Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) = 0.710 250 mol mol-1
for NIST SRM 987 and a correction to this value is not
certain. When absolute n(87Sr)/n(86Sr) isotope ratios are
reported the methodology is typically described in detail
and the isotope ratio term is clearly identified (e.g.,
Tchaikovsky et al. 2019).
Rock RMs are the type of material investigated most
often for Rcon(87Sr/86Sr), with reporting an ‘external precision’
instead of measurement uncertainties. Fourny et al. (2016)
analysed 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) in geolog-
ical RMs, including pyroxenite, basalts, diabase, dolerite,
norite and anorthosite. The reported ‘external precision’
expressed as 2s, is ≤0.000 030 mol mol-1 (Fourny
et al. 2016). Repeatability, also known as “internal precision”,
expressed as 2sm, and reported by Weis et al. (2005) in
their study on
87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) in
basalts (BHVO-1 and BHVO-2) was ≤0.000 020 mol
mol-1. In another study Weis et al. (2006) analysed USGS

measured
87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) in different batches
and aliquots of the first releases of the USGS RMs BCR-1,
BHVO-1, AGV-1 and GSP-1 as well as in the second
release of the RMs BCR-2, BHVO-2, AGV-2 and GSP-2. The
reported ‘external precision’ (2s) was 0.000 034 mol mol-1
(Raczek et al. 2003). Another study on 87Sr/86Sr isotope
ratios Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) in silicate reference materials was
published by Balcaen et al. (2005). Therein, the MC-ICP-MS
results obtained for the RMs G-2, AGV-1 and BCR-1 agreed
with the corresponding MC-TIMS values with a difference
between both instruments of ≤0.000 022 mol mol-1 in all
cases. In our study the expanded measurement uncertainty,
U, of the consensus value corresponds to 95 % confidence.
For all cases the expanded measurement uncertainty was
≤0.000 007 mol mol-1, except for IAG OPC-1 where it was
0.000 024 mol mol-1. The difference between MC-ICP-MS
and MC-TIMS was ≤0.000 005 mol mol-1 for IAG CGL
ML3, VDZ-100a, VDZ-200a and VDZ-300a, while for IAG
OPC-1 and OU-6 the difference was 0.000 016 mol mol-1
and 0.000 027 mol mol-1, respectively, all covered by the
associated measurement uncertainties. In terms of pure
numbers and ignoring that our study presents measurement
reproducibility whilst the cited studies present intermediate
measurement precision, the performance of the cited studies
was matched or even exceeded. By providing measurement
uncertainties calculated according to international guide-
lines with validated analytical procedures quality levels of
routine measurements were exceeded, which is one of the
requirements for providing reference values.
Homogeneity and minimum sample mass
With the first screening of the reported results, a larger
spread for IAG OPC-1 and OU-6 compared with the other
reference materials could be observed. As already stated,
this might be attributed to material heterogeneity but also to
increased difficulties with sample digestion. This issue
requires
additional
attention
prior
to
reference
value
assignment. Experiences in reference material production
typically show an increase in heterogeneity with decreasing
sample mass (also termed ‘test portion’). Therefore, the
reproducibility for each material, as reported by each lab,
was plotted versus the mean sample mass used for
individual digestions (Figure 4). It is obvious that for IAG
OPC-1 and OU-6 the reproducibility gets worse with
decreasing sample mass, while for the other materials no
clear
effect
can
be
observed.
This
suggests
sample
heterogeneity
concerning
the
87Sr/86Sr
isotope
ratios
Rcon(87Sr/86Sr). It has to be noted here, that typically such
investigations are performed with one analytical procedure
by using different sample masses. In the present study
different sample preparation procedures have been applied
by the individual laboratories and therefore the variability of
these is contained in Figure 4 as well. In summary it can be
stated that a minimum sample mass of 100 mg works well
for IAG CGL ML-3, VDZ 100a, VDZ 200a, and VDZ 300a
and still provides satisfying results for IAG OPC-1 and OU-6.
More reproducible 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios Rcon(87Sr/86Sr)
can be obtained for IAG OPC-1 and OU-6 with a minimum
sample mass of 200 mg; this also accounts for other
complex silicate rocks.
The findings on the minimum sample mass suggest
significant heterogeneity for low sample mass at least for
some materials. Therefore, an uncertainty contribution for
potential
heterogeneity
is
added,
when
assigning
a
reference value to all six materials. A complete homogeneity
study, however, was not possible, because insufficient
information on the reference material batch (e.g., batch size,
preparation procedure) and too few units of the reference
materials were available. In the ILC documentation informa-
tion on all subsamples, the original reference material units
they have been derived from, and the laboratory the
subsamples have been sent to were available. To get an
estimate for a potential sample heterogeneity the mean
values of each RM unit were calculated and then the means
of the RM units were averaged for each RM. The associated
standard deviations, si, and the associated degrees of
freedom, νi, were further processed by applying a Bayesian
model to estimate the true values of si and νi. This model
involves a gamma likelihood function and a Cauchy prior
distribution for the true values of νi. The medians of these
posterior distributions give the estimates of the true variances
which in turn results in uncertainty contribution due to
homogeneity/inhomogeneity, uhom, after calculating the
square root (Table 4). It has to be noted here that IAG
OPC-1 and IAG OU-6 show a larger spread of the
between-bottle means compared with all other RMs, which
is reflected to some extent in the between-bottle uncertainty
contributions.
Assignment of reference values
According to international guidelines and standards
(e.g., ISO 17034 and ISO Guide 35) certification is the
combination of all available results and data including, but
not exclusively: homogeneity, stability, and characterisation in
order to assign certified values with their associated
uncertainties
with
the
ultimate
goal
to
approve
the
certificates and the certification report. The authors are not
capable of conducting any certification of these materials

according to ISO 17034 as they do not possess ownership
of the RMs. However, reference values can be assigned to
the investigated reference materials within the scope of this
publication. An assessment of the homogeneity of the
material was made in the previous subsection; one on
stability is not deemed necessary. The main reasons for this
are the stability of the matrix under the specified conditions
and the stability of the analyte. Analyte loss caused by
volatile analyte species is not expected and contamination is
extremely unlikely. Additionally, the isotope ratios do not
change as long as no loss or gain of analyte occurs. Finally,
characterisation of the material concerning the measurand,
the
87Sr/86Sr isotope ratio Rcon(87Sr/86Sr), was realised
within the ILC study. Consequentially, the data from the
homogeneity assessment and the ILC study are combined for
the assignment of reference values to the six materials
(Table 5). In fact, the standard uncertainty of the consensus
value and the uncertainty from the homogeneity assessment
are quadratically added that the square root thereof yields
the combined standard uncertainties of the assigned
reference value with values ranging between uc = 0.000
003 mol mol-1 and uc = 0.000 022 mol mol-1. The effective
degrees of freedom, νeff, which were obtained using the
Welch-Satterthwaite
formula
(equation
G.2,
BIPM
et al. 2008) and the data from characterisation and
homogeneity
assessment,
define
the
coverage
factors
needed to yield the expanded measurement uncertainty
corresponding to a 95 % confidence interval. The resulting
coverage factors range from k = 2.00 to k = 2.09 yielding
relative expanded uncertainties of all RMs of ≤0.007 %.

The measurement uncertainty associated with the assigned
reference values is thus influenced by the significantly larger
contribution of the homogeneity assessment.
Geochemical classification of the 87Sr/86Sr iso-
tope ratios Rcon(87Sr/86Sr)
The 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) determined
for the limestone RM IAG CGL ML3 and the three cement
RMs VDZ-100a, VDZ-200a, VDZ-300a are similar to those
of Phanerozoic seawater ranging from 0.706 90 mol mol-1
to 0.709 18 mol mol-1 (Bentley 2006), whereas the slate RM
IAG OU-6 and the South African cement RM IAG OPC-1
resulted
in
more

87Sr/86Sr

Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) of 0.729 778 mol mol-1 and 0.726 458

(Kazlagi´c et al. 2022). Marl contains both the carbonate
and the silicate component and is commonly used when
marl deposits occur close to the cement production sites. It is
reasonable to assume that the
87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios
Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) of cements are dominated by the Sr isotopic
signature of the carbonate raw material, due to the typically
high Sr mass fractions in the carbonate raw materials (e.g.,
IAG CGL ML3), the generally much lower Sr mass fractions
in the silicate (e.g., IAG OU-6), and the higher proportion
of carbonate to silicate. The
87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios
Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) of two of the German cements, RMs VDZ-
100a (0.708 134 mol mol-1) and VDZ-200a (0.708 257
mol mol-1), likely reflect the use of Phanerozoic marine
carbonate as raw material. Based on the regional geology
in Germany, Cretaceous to Devonian limestone or marl
deposits are most likely the carbonate sources. The mixture of
a marine Phanerozoic carbonate signature with Sr derived
from the silicate component as well as the various possible
additives used in cement production likely resulted in a
slightly
more
radiogenic
87Sr/86Sr
isotope
ratio
Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) in the bulk cement. The silicate component
and
most
additive
materials
are
on
average
more
radiogenic than the marine carbonate due to their generally
higher Rb/Sr ratio and the higher age. The 87Sr/86Sr isotope
ratio Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) = 0.709 326 mol mol-1 of VDZ-300a is
slightly higher than that of modern seawater (0.709 18 mol
mol-1, McArthur et al. 2001) and could reflect admixture of a
young marine carbonate component derived from the late
Miocene or younger, or it is a consequence of more
radiogenic minerals, mostly silicates which is expressed by
the higher SiO2 mass fraction of VDZ300a (SiO2 mass
fractions of VDZ 300a 31.0 %, VDZ 200a 22.5 %, VDZ
100a 20.0 %) containing a higher proportion of radiogenic
Sr from silicates. In contrast to the German cement RMs the
IAG OPC-1 cement RM from South Africa has a strikingly
high 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratio Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) = 0.726 458
mol mol-1. Consistent with the occurrence of old Proterozoic
and Archaean rocks common in much of South Africa, such a

high
87Sr/86Sr
isotope
ratio
Rcon(87Sr/86Sr)
points
to
geologically old carbonate and/or silicate raw materials.
The 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratio Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) = 0.708 246
mol mol-1 of the limestone RM IAG CGL ML3 is consistent
with a marine origin of the carbonate raw material used
during the RM production. Given that the Sr mass fraction of
IAG CGL ML3 (w(Sr) = 1018 mg kg-1) is high and the Sr
mass fraction of silicates can plausibly be assumed to be
much lower, it is not very likely (but it cannot be excluded)
that the small amount of admixed clay material (≈5 %) has
shifted the bulk 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratio Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) of IAG
CGL ML3 away from the original marine carbonate
signature, even if the admixed silicate phases contain a
radiogenic
87Sr/86Sr signature. Assuming a radiogenic
87Sr/86Sr signature of the clay admixture, the original
carbonate component of the limestone from Mongolia
should have a less radiogenic
87Sr/86Sr isotope ratio
Rcon(87Sr/86Sr)
than the
bulk RM
with
Rcon(87Sr/86Sr)
= 0.708 246 mol mol-1.
The slate RM OU-6 resulted in a radiogenic 87Sr/86Sr
isotope ratio Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) = 0.729 778 mol mol-1
consistent
both
with
the
geologically
old
(Cambrian)
deposition age of the rock and the relatively high Rb mass
fraction of 121 mg kg-1. In relation to the Sr mass fraction of
132 mg kg-1 this results in a Rb/Sr ratio of approximately
0.92, which caused a significant 87Sr ingrowth by 87Rb
decay over time.
Conclusion and outlook
We assigned reference values for
87Sr/86Sr isotope
ratios Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) to the investigated reference materials
of cement, limestone and slate, and evaluated differences in
the application of MC-TIMS and MC-ICP-MS. Here, no
statistically
significant
effects
attributable
to
differences
between the instrumental techniques employed for measur-
ing 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios were observed, neither when
testing for all RMs together nor when testing for each RM
individually. Reference values were assigned to the RMs,
ranging from low, so-called ‘non-radiogenic’ signatures, to
high, very ‘radiogenic’ signatures. Associated measurement
uncertainties were calculated including the uncertainties
of the consensus values and uncertainty contributions
from homogeneity assessment. All 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios
Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) measured in this study, but especially the
reference values, are traceable to the conventional method,
defined and described in detail in this publication. Hence,
the RMs IAG CGL ML-3, IAG OPC-1, IAG OU6, VDZ 100a,
VDZ 200a and VDZ 300a characterised in this study are
recommended for use as RMs to verify the performance of
instruments, validate analytical procedures including sample
digestion and Sr separation, calculate measurement uncer-
tainties as well as for monitoring the measurement trueness
and assessing the quality of Sr isotope ratio measurements.
In this ILC on 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios Rcon(87Sr/86Sr)
metrological principles were considered and the metrolog-
ical compatibility of Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) measurement results
obtained by MC-ICP-MS and MC-TIMS was demonstrated.
The work carried out in this study is not considered for
informational purposes only, but also to provide the user
community with traceable and reliable Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) values
for commonly available RMs. Thus, laboratories can use
these
data,
without
the
need
for
additional
quality
assessment and data treatment. This interlaboratory com-
parison study is a sound example of characterising 87Sr/86Sr
isotope ratios Rcon(87Sr/86Sr) in industrial and geological
materials. It should serve as an example for future ILC studies
and is strongly recommended to be repeated on different
matrices and isotope systems. Extended information includ-
ing the technical report, the reporting template, and
calculation
examples
