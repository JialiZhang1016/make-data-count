Abstract
Background: Single-cell RNA sequencing has been widely adopted to estimate the
cellular composition of heterogeneous tissues and obtain transcriptional profiles of
individual cells. Multiple approaches for optimal sample dissociation and storage of
single cells have been proposed as have single-nuclei profiling methods. What has
been lacking is a systematic comparison of their relative biases and benefits.
Results: Here, we compare gene expression and cellular composition of single-cell
suspensions prepared from adult mouse kidney using two tissue dissociation
protocols. For each sample, we also compare fresh cells to cryopreserved and
methanol-fixed cells. Lastly, we compare this single-cell data to that generated using
three single-nucleus RNA sequencing workflows. Our data confirms prior reports that
digestion on ice avoids the stress response observed with 37 °C dissociation. It also
reveals cell types more abundant either in the cold or warm dissociations that may
represent populations that require gentler or harsher conditions to be released
intact. For cell storage, cryopreservation of dissociated cells results in a major loss of
epithelial cell types; in contrast, methanol fixation maintains the cellular composition
but suffers from ambient RNA leakage. Finally, cell type composition differences are
observed between single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing libraries. In
particular, we note an underrepresentation of T, B, and NK lymphocytes in the single-
nucleus libraries.
Conclusions: Systematic comparison of recovered cell types and their transcriptional
profiles across the workflows has highlighted protocol-specific biases and thus
enables researchers starting single-cell experiments to make an informed choice.

Background
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is an increasingly powerful technology that
enables analysis of gene expression in individual cells. ScRNA-seq has been recently
used to study organism development [1–3], normal tissues [4–6], cancer [7–10], and

other diseases [11, 12]. These studies have shed light on tissue heterogeneity and pro-
vided previously inaccessible insights into tissue functioning.
Advances in high-throughput droplet-based microfluidics technologies have facili-
tated analysis of thousands of cells in parallel [13–15], and Chromium from 10x
Genomics has become a widely used commercial platform [15]. Multiple tissue
preparation protocols are compatible with Chromium, but the protocol of choice
should ideally maintain RNA integrity and cell composition of the original tissue.
Solid tissues need to be dissociated to release individual cells suitable for 10x Genom-
ics Chromium scRNA-seq. However, optimal dissociation needs to achieve a balance
between releasing cell types that are difficult to dissociate while avoiding damage to
those that are fragile. Tissue dissociation is most commonly conducted using enzymes
which require incubation at 37 °C for variable times based on tissue type. At this
temperature, the cell transcriptional machinery is active; hence, gene expression can be
altered in response to the dissociation and other environmental stresses [16, 17]. A re-
cent alternative approach minimizing this artifact uses cold-active protease to conduct
tissue dissociation on ice [18]. Alternatively, single-nucleus RNA sequencing protocols
(snRNA-seq) use much harsher conditions to release nuclei from tissue and can be ap-
plied to snap frozen samples, thus avoiding many of the dissociation-related artifacts
[19, 20]. Single-nuclei methods should also permit profiling of nuclei from large cells
(> 40 μm) that do not fit through the microfluidics.
Additional restrictions and challenges are faced by complex experimental designs
where specimens cannot be processed immediately. In this case, samples need to
be preserved either as an intact tissue or in a dissociated form as a single-cell sus-
pension. Each of the approaches mentioned above introduces specific biases and
artifacts that can manifest themselves in altered transcriptional profiles or altered
representation of cell types. These biases need to be considered when designing
and analyzing data from a single-cell experiment; however, they are still incom-
pletely understood.
Some of the artifacts have been investigated in recent studies comparing single-cell
profiles of methanol-fixed and live cells [21, 22], cryopreserved and live cells [22, 23],
single-cell and single-nucleus protocols [24–26], or tissue dissociation using cold-active
protease and traditional digestion at 37 °C [18]. However, these assessments were per-
formed in different tissues under different conditions and lack extensive comparison to
bulk data.
Here, we performed a comprehensive study in healthy adult mouse kidneys using
10x Genomics Chromium workflows for scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq, along with
bulk RNA-seq of undissociated and dissociated tissue. We compare and contrast
two tissue dissociation protocols (digestion at 37 °C, further referred to as warm
dissociation, or with cold-active protease, further referred to as cold dissociation),
two single-cell suspension preservation methods (methanol fixation and cryopreser-
vation) and three single-nuclei isolation protocols (Fig. 1). A total of 77,656 single-
cell, 98,303 single-nucleus, and 15 bulk RNA-seq profiles were generated and made
publicly available (GSE141115). Our dissection of artifacts associated with each of
the approaches will serve as a valuable resource to aid interpretation of single-cell
and single-nucleus gene expression data and help to guide the choice of experi-
mental workflows.

Results
Comparison of tissue dissociation protocols
In the first series of experiments, we set out to compare two tissue dissociation proto-
cols using kidneys from adult male C57BL/6J mice. Kidneys were dissociated at 37 °C
using a commercial Miltenyi Multi Tissue Dissociation Kit 2 or on ice using a cold-
active protease from Bacillus licheniformis (“Methods”, Fig. 1a, b). Aliquots of single-
cell suspensions were profiled using 10x Genomics Chromium scRNA-seq and a bulk
RNA-seq protocol (“Methods”, Fig. 1a, b). All experiments were performed in triplicate,
and data were processed as described in “Methods”.
Warm tissue dissociation induces stress response
Bulk RNA-seq profiling of single-cell suspensions revealed induction of stress response
genes in warm-dissociated samples. Differential expression analysis identified 71 genes
with higher expression in warm-dissociated kidneys and 5 genes with higher expression in
cold-dissociated kidneys (logFC > 2, FDR < 0.05, edgeR exact test [27], Additional file 1).
Fig. 1 Overview of experiments performed in this study. All experiments were carried out in biological triplicate using
three kidneys from three different mice. a 37 °C dissociation used the Multi-tissue dissociation kit 2 from Miltenyi
Biotec. b Cold dissociation was carried out on ice using B. Licheniformis protease. In a and b, methanol-fixed samples
used 80% MeOH at −20 °C and then were stored at −80 °C. Cryopreservation was carried out using 50% FBS, 40%
RPMI-1640, 10% and DMSO with gradient cooling to −80 °C then stored in liquid nitrogen. c–e Whole kidneys were
flash frozen using an isopentane bath −30 °C and then stored at −80 °C. Three different nuclei preparation methods
were tested using either fluorescently activated nuclei sorting (FANS) or a sucrose gradient to enrich for singlet nuclei.
f Bulk RNA-seq was carried out using the NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Kit for Illumina with rRNA depletion or NEBNext
Poly(A) mRNA isolation module. See “Methods” for more details

Gene ontology analysis with ToppGene [28] reported “regulation of cell death” as the top
significantly enriched biological process for the genes more highly expressed in warm-
dissociated kidneys (an overlap of 22 genes, FDR = 1.7E−7, see Additional file 1). Genes
with the highest logFC values (> 4) included immediate-early genes Fosb, Fos, Jun, Junb,
Atf3, and Egr1 and heat shock proteins Hspa1a and Hspa1b (Fig. 2a). These findings from
bulk RNA-seq confirm the original observations of Adam et al. [18] that warm tissue dis-
sociation induces substantial stress-response-related changes.
Single-cell sequencing reveals heterogeneous stress response across cell populations
We next characterized differences between the two tissue dissociation protocols by
scRNA-seq profiling of fresh cell suspensions (Fig. 1a, b). This dataset comprised 23,
108 cells, including 11,851 cells from cold- and 11,257 cells from warm-dissociated kid-
neys (“Methods”). Cells were classified into 15 cell types using scMatch [31] by compar-
ing their expression to reference expression profiles from three previous mouse kidney
studies [26, 32, 33], followed by gene signature-based refinement (“Methods”, Add-
itional file 2: Figure S1–3, Additional file 3).
Differential expression analysis identified 64 genes more highly expressed in warm-
dissociated libraries in at least one cell type (Fig. 2b, Additional file 4) and gene ontol-
ogy analysis again reported “regulation of cell death” as one of the top significantly
enriched terms (an overlap of 23 genes, FDR = 3.9E−7, Additional file 4). The genes
most commonly overexpressed across cell populations are shown in Fig. 2d and include
immediate-early response genes such as Junb and Jund (differentially expressed in seven
cell types) and Jun and Fos (differentially expressed in five cell types).
Notably, the numbers of differentially expressed genes varied among cell types
(Fig. 2b), suggesting that cell types respond differently to warm tissue dissociation. To
quantify these differences, we selected a set of 17 known stress-response-related genes
that were induced in the warm-dissociated samples (Fosb, Fos, Jun, Junb, Jund, Atf3,
Egr1, Hspa1a, Hspa1b, Hsp90ab1, Hspa8, Hspb1, Ier3, Ier2, Btg1, Btg2, Dusp1) and used
them to calculate a stress score (see “Methods”). Figure 2c shows that significantly high
stress scores were detected only in warm-dissociated samples in eight out of 14 cell
types. Taken together, these results highlight that certain cell types, such as immune
and endothelial cells, are particularly sensitive to warm tissue dissociation.
In contrast to the 64 genes with higher expression in the warm dissociation, only 20
genes had higher expression in the cold-dissociated cell populations, and only five of
them (Hbb-bs, Hba-a1, Hba-a2, mt-Co1, Malat1) were identified in at least two cell
types (Fig. 2b, Additional file 5). We note the levels of hemoglobin transcripts suggest
contamination from erythrocytes is higher in the samples dissociated on ice.
Cell composition differs between two tissue dissociation protocols
In addition to expression changes, our analyses identified eight cell populations that
were less abundant in warm-dissociated samples in comparison to cold-dissociated
ones, including podocytes, mesangial cells, and endothelial cells (Fig. 2e left, chi-square
test p value < 0.001). These depleted populations also showed significantly high expres-
sion of the stress-response-related gene set as described above (Fig. 2c). Notably, only
three podocytes were detected in warm-dissociated samples (0.03% of the total cell

count), compared to 330 (2.78%) in the cold-dissociated samples. These findings sug-
gest that these populations are sensitive to warm dissociation and consequently
underrepresented.
Conversely, we identified cells such as those of the ascending loop of Henle (aLOH)
and proximal tubule (PT), that were more abundant in warm-dissociated samples
(aLOH 4.99% vs. 2.52% in cold, PT 71.36% vs. 63.34% in cold), potentially indicating
their less efficient dissociation by cold-active protease (Fig. 2e right).
Finally, to determine whether microfluidic partitioning could affect cell composition,
we compared bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data generated on the same dissociated
kidney samples (Additional file 6: Supplementary Note 1). Our results suggest that pro-
portions of aLOH cells in cell suspensions were higher before they were loaded on the
Chromium Controller and that they are somehow underrepresented. As to possible
mechanisms for this, it may be that they are more resistant to lysis in the device or that
there is differential sampling of these cells due to cell size or shape as they enter the
microfluidic device.
Comparison of cell preservation protocols
We next evaluated whether cryopreservation and methanol fixation maintain cell com-
position and transcriptional profiles of kidneys. Aliquots of single-cell suspensions of
cold- and warm-dissociated kidneys were cryopreserved (50% FBS, 40% RPMI-1640,
10% DMSO) and stored for 6 weeks or methanol-fixed and stored for 3 months. These
stored samples were then profiled with 10x Genomics Chromium scRNA-seq (Fig. 1a,
b, “Methods”). The resulting datasets consisted of 11,627 and 5545 methanol-fixed cells
and 3519 and 3483 cryopreserved cells derived from cold- and warm-dissociated kid-
neys, respectively. Despite loading similar numbers of cells, the number of high-quality
cells obtained from the cryopreserved samples after quality control and filtering
(“Methods”) was substantially lower (~ 30%) than that of the fresh and methanol-fixed
samples.
Cryopreservation depletes epithelial cell types
The most prominent difference in recovery rates pertained to cells of the proximal tu-
bule (PT), the most populous cell type in kidney [34]. In freshly profiled suspensions,
PT composed 63.12% and 70.86% of all cells in cold- and warm-dissociated samples, re-
spectively. In contrast, PT were scarcely detected in cryopreserved samples, at 0.31%
and 0.57%, respectively (see Fig. 3a for cold-dissociated samples, Additional file 2: Fig-
ure S4 for warm-dissociated samples, Additional file 2: Figure S5 for biological repli-
cates). We next compared recovery rates of other cell populations in freshly profiled
and cryopreserved samples relative to all non-PT cells. This comparison revealed sig-
nificant underrepresentation (chi-square test p value < 0.001) of five kidney cell types in
cryopreserved samples prepared with the cold dissociation protocol, three of which
were also underrepresented in the cryopreserved warm dissociation samples (Add-
itional file 2: Figure S6). Together with the loss of PT cells, this indicates that the cryo-
preservation and subsequent thawing protocol failed to efficiently recover kidney
epithelial cell populations.

Previous studies have reported cryopreserved cells generate comparable data to that
of fresh cells [22, 23]. Hence, we repeated the experiment comparing cryopreserved
and freshly profiled cold-dissociated single-cell suspension aliquots using different mice
(Balb/c female), 10x chemistry (v3 as opposed to v2), storage length (2 weeks as op-
posed to 6 weeks), and centrifugation speed for thawing and resuspension (1200g as
opposed to 400g). Again, there was a significant depletion of PT cells, with them mak-
ing up 55.55% of the freshly profiled cells but only 7.65% of the cryopreserved cells
(Additional file 2: Figure S7). Notably, only ~ 33% and ~ 32% of cells were recovered
after cryostorage in the first and the repeated experiment, respectively; the average via-
bility estimated by the Countess was 86% and 75%, respectively. From this, we conclude
that, at least in the case of mouse kidneys, cryopreservation of dissociated cells using
50% FBS, 40% RPMI, and 10% DMSO can induce substantial deleterious changes in cell
composition.
In contrast to a previous report assessing storage of cell lines and immune cells [22],
in the case of dissociated mouse kidneys, methanol fixation better preserved cell type
composition than cryopreservation (Fig. 3a, Additional file 2: Figure S4–5). Neverthe-
less, certain cell types were moderately underrepresented in the methanol-fixed samples
in comparison to freshly profiled samples, with macrophages showing the largest reduc-
tion from 5.36 to 3.2% in cold-dissociated samples and from 4.28 to 2.54% in warm-
dissociated samples.

Cryopreservation induces stress response
To gain further insights into preservation-related artifacts, we compared gene expres-
sion between preserved and freshly profiled samples in each cell type separately. In
cold-dissociated samples, 31 and 27 genes were overexpressed in at least one cell type
in cryopreserved and methanol-fixed cells, respectively, when compared to freshly pro-
filed suspensions (Fig. 3b, see Additional file 2: Figure S4 for warm-dissociated
samples).
In cryopreserved samples, stress-response-related genes were induced, including mul-
tiple immediate-early response genes and heat shock proteins (Fig. 3c, Additional file 2:
Figure S4, Additional files 7, 8). In contrast, genes overexpressed in methanol-fixed
cells were those highly expressed in tubular cells and hemoglobin genes (Fig. 3d, Add-
itional files 9, 10). The same set of transcripts contaminated most cell types suggesting
methanol fixation damages cells and leads to ambient RNA contamination of droplets
(see Additional file 6: Supplementary Note 2 for more detailed investigation of the am-
bient RNA profile).
Comparison of single-cell and single-nucleus sequencing protocols
Having identified cold-active protease as a less damaging tissue dissociation approach
for scRNA-seq, we next compared it to snRNA-seq. We performed a series of experi-
ments using kidneys from Balb/c male mice with v2 10x chemistry or female mice with
v3 chemistry and prepared cells using cold tissue dissociation for scRNA-seq and nuclei
using three variant protocols for snRNA-seq (“Methods”, Fig. 1b–e). Two nuclei isola-
tion protocols made use of fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting (FANS). The first
protocol washed the nuclei three times and used a centrifugation speed of 500g (further
referred to as SN_FANS_3x500g, Fig. 1c). In the second protocol, nuclei were washed
once and a centrifugation speed of 2000g was used (SN_FANS_1x2000g, Fig. 1d). In the
third protocol, nuclei were initially washed using a 500g spin and then cleaned using a
sucrose cushion avoiding the requirement to sort isolated nuclei (SN_sucrose, Fig. 1e).
The three nuclei isolation protocols yielded comparable results, with the most notable
difference being a higher contamination with mitochondrial genes in SN_FANS_
1x2000g (see Additional file 6: Supplementary Note 3 and Additional files 11, 12, 13).
Single-nuclei sequencing detected more genes per nuclei than single-cell sequencing
per cell, with the median numbers of 1819 and 981 genes, respectively (genes detected
in at least 10 cells/nuclei were retained in each sample). In addition, we performed bulk
RNA-seq of intact flash-frozen whole kidneys and of cold-dissociated cell suspensions
(Fig. 1b, f).
Detection rates of non-epithelial kidney cell types were markedly different between
scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq libraries (Fig. 4a, Additional file 2: Figure S8, Add-
itional file 14). Immune cells were detected at lower rates in snRNA-seq (average of
0.73%) than in scRNA-seq (average of 6.03%) across all experiments performed (Fig. 4a,
Additional file 2: Figure S8). Using the bulk RNA-seq from intact kidneys (Fig. 1f) and
BSEQ-sc [35] to predict the proportions of each cell type present, we estimated that ap-
proximately 1.51% should correspond to immune cells in Balb/c female mice and 4.84%
in Balb/c male mice. This suggests an underrepresentation of immune cells in the
snRNA-seq data. Furthermore, macrophages were the only type of immune cells
Denisenko et al. Genome Biology          (2020) 21:130 
Page 8 of 25
recovered in snRNA-seq libraries, whereas in scRNA-seq libraries we also detected T
cells (1.38% on average), B cells (0.77%), and NK cells (0.65%). Similarly, podocytes
composed only 0.7% in snRNA-seq libraries as opposed to 3.28% in scRNA-seq (Fig. 4a,
Additional file 2: Figure S8). Cell types more abundant in snRNA-seq libraries included
loop of Henle and mesangial cells (Fig. 4a, Additional file 2: Figure S8).
We next compared the observed cell composition to estimates of epithelial cell type
contribution based on quantitative renal anatomy, as reported by Clark et al. recently
[34]. Figure 4b and Additional file 2: Figure S8 show that for some cell types, such as
podocytes, scRNA-seq yields proportions most similar to the quantitative renal anat-
omy estimates, whereas for other cell types, such as loop of Henle cells, snRNA-seq

better captures cell composition. Bulk RNA-seq-based proportions estimated from in-
tact kidneys largely contradicted the anatomical estimates, which might reflect inaccur-
ate deconvolution of the sample. Finally, comparison of bulk RNA-seq profiles of intact
kidneys and cold-dissociated cell suspensions from female Balb/c mice suggested cell
types that may be unequally represented in whole vs dissociated kidneys (see Add-
itional file 6: Supplementary Note 4 and Additional file 15).
Differential expression analysis comparing individual cell types profiled by snRNA-seq
and scRNA-seq suggested higher expression of long noncoding RNAs in snRNA-seq li-
braries and higher expression of genes related to mitochondrial and ribosomal functions
in scRNA-seq, in agreement with previous reports [24, 26] (Additional file 16).
Finally, as mitotic cells lack a nuclear membrane and in principle should not be ob-
served in the snRNA-seq data, we inferred cell cycle phases for cells and nuclei using
Seurat (“Methods”) [30]. Notably, Seurat predicted a higher fraction of G1 phase cells
and lower fraction of S phase cells in scRNA-seq libraries when compared to snRNA-
seq libraries for virtually all cell types (Additional file 2: Figure S9). This suggests that
there are indeed underlying biases in cell cycle phase distributions in snRNA-seq data
in comparison to scRNA-seq data; however, to fully dissect this, a classifier that can
discriminate mitotic cells from early G1 and late G2 is required.
Discussion
Interrogating complex tissues at the level of individual cells is essential to understand
organ development, homeostasis, and pathological changes. Despite the rapid advance-
ment and widespread adoption of scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq technologies, the associ-
ated biases remain incompletely understood. To characterize some of the biases, we
performed a systematic comparison of recovered cell types and their transcriptional
profiles across two tissue dissociation protocols, two single-cell suspension preservation
methods and three single-nuclei isolation protocols, each with three biological repli-
cates per experiment.
Previous studies have reported on artifactual gene expression changes induced by
proteolytic tissue digestion at 37 °C in sensitive cell populations [16, 18]. Our findings
corroborate this bias and show induction of heat shock proteins and immediate-early
response genes in warm-dissociated libraries when compared to cold-dissociated librar-
ies. Cold-dissociated libraries can serve as a baseline in this case, since low temperature
should minimize new transcription [18]. Our results further indicate that cell popula-
tions prone to these transcriptional changes are also depleted from the samples, with
podocytes being the extreme example of a cell type practically lost in warm-dissociated
libraries. Overexpression of stress-response-related genes was also detected by bulk
RNA-seq analysis of dissociated tissues, confirming that this artifact stems from the dis-
sociation protocol rather than from microfluidic separation, single-cell sequencing, or
data processing. These findings have important implications and suggest that data from
samples digested at 37 °C needs to be interpreted in light of this bias.
One possible drawback of cold tissue dissociation is lower efficiency of releasing
hard-to-dissociate cell types. In our study, this may have affected cells of loop of Henle,
which were detected at 2.52% in cold- and at 4.99% in warm-dissociated samples. How-
ever, both protocols dramatically underestimated abundance of this second most
populous kidney cell type. While one possible explanation could be incomplete tissue

dissociation in both cases, deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq profiles of single-cell sus-
pensions indicated that cells might be lost during cell encapsulation on the microfluidic
device.
Cold-dissociated samples showed higher contamination with hemoglobin transcripts
than warm-dissociated ones. We note that red blood cell depletion methods were not ap-
plied in any of the experiments performed here and the observation likely stems from a
higher rate of hemoglobin transcript degradation in warm tissue dissociation conditions.
Two recent studies have shown that cryopreservation generated comparable data to
that of fresh cells for cell lines and immune cells, and also for complex tissues cryopre-
served prior to single-cell separation [22, 23]. Here, however, we report that cryopreser-
vation of single-cell suspensions of dissociated mouse kidneys resulted in depletion of
epithelial cell types. This artifact was reproducible across two mouse strains, both sexes,
and two 10x chemistry versions. However, we observed a higher fraction of recovered
PT cells (7.65% vs. 0.57%) in the repeated experiment, which might be explained by ei-
ther sex or strain differences, or higher sensitivity of 10x v3 chemistry. Together with
the depletion of PT cells, we observed reduced contamination of other cells with highly
expressed PT transcripts, which indicates that PT cells might be lost in the thawing
and resuspension. A possible explanation for the differences from previous reports is
the proportion of serum used in the freezing media. 10x Genomics recommends 40%
FBS (10x Genomics, CG00039, Rev. D), whereas the other studies used either 90% FBS
(peripheral blood, minced tissues, cell lines, and immune cells) or 10% FBS (cell lines)
[22, 23]. Notably, despite loading similar numbers of fresh, methanol-fixed and cryopre-
served cells, the number of the usable cells observed in the cryopreserved samples was
only ~ 30% of the others. This raises the possibilities that the missing PT cells may be
present but are failing to make it into the microfluidics, failing to lyse, or are so badly
damaged that there is insufficient RNA remaining to generate a usable library. In con-
trast to cryopreservation, cell composition of methanol-fixed suspensions resembled
that of freshly profiled libraries. Similarly to previous studies, we observed ambient
RNA contamination with highly abundant transcripts suggesting cell damage by metha-
nol fixation [22].
Studies comparing scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq reported that, although the two
technologies profile different RNA fractions, both detect sufficient genes and
allow adequate representation of cell populations [24–26]. In this work, one of
the most notable differences between single-cell and single-nuclei experiments
was the low detection rate of immune cells, in particular the failure to detect T,
B, or NK cells in any of the snRNA-seq libraries. The depletion of lymphocytes
was also observed in the Wu et al. [26] dataset (commented upon by O’Sullivan
et al. [36]). Notably Slyper et al. [37] also observe much lower fractions of T, B,
and NK cells in matched snRNA-seq and scRNA-seq datasets from adjacent
pieces of a metastatic breast cancer and a neuroblastoma. As Wu et al. have sug-
gested, although these differences might indicate underestimation of immune cells
by snRNA-seq, another plausible explanation is that immune cell content is in-
flated in single-cell experiments as other cell types may be underrepresented due
to incomplete dissociation.
It is important to remember that cell type composition of single-cell or single-nucleus
data differs from that of the original tissue and complementary approaches may be

considered to improve the accuracy of the estimates. We note that even ISH/IHC/spatial
transcriptomic methods, unless carried out on sufficient serial sections to completely sur-
vey the tissue of interest, will only give cellular proportions for the sections examined and
will not give a whole (3D) organ estimate. Similarly, flow cytometry would help as an or-
thogonal approach to quantify cellular proportions within single-cell suspensions but still
requires the organ to be dissociated, which as we have shown here has biases. Although
in vitro cell mixtures or cell spiking experiments could be used to introduce different cell
types at known ratios, we have not employed them in these experiments as they do not
represent a true scenario of dissociation from a solid tissue.
Clark et al. recently reported cell frequency estimates based on quantitative renal
anatomy. However, these were restricted to renal epithelial cells [34]. Based on these
estimates, some cell types, such as podocytes, appear to be better represented in
scRNA-seq, whereas others, such as loop of Henle cells, were captured more effectively
by snRNA-seq. We also attempted to use computational deconvolution of bulk RNA-
seq of intact kidneys to infer its cell composition. However, the approach is sensitive to
the input marker gene list used and may overlook rare and novel cell types. In addition,
cell abundance estimates from bulk data would be influenced by both cell number and
relative mRNA content of each cell. We will continue to search for approaches to bet-
ter define the “ground truth” for cell composition.
In this study, we reported on a range of biases of experimental procedures. We
would like to stress that computational tools are being actively developed to miti-
gate these biases. These include tools for decontamination such as DecontX [38]
or SoupX [39], tools for batch-effect removal such as Seurat [30] and Harmony
[40], and many others. Hence, even when a dataset in hand is affected by pro-
nounced technical artifacts, certain computational techniques might be useful in re-
ducing their effect.
Conclusions
From our experiments, we have confirmed several observations by others in the field
that have direct relevance to designing single-cell experiments studying human disease
biology. Specifically, the depletion of epithelial cell types in cryopreserved samples is
concerning given the majority of human cancers are epithelial in origin. Similarly, the
underrepresentation of T, B, and NK cells in snRNA-seq data is of critical relevance for
studies of tumor immunology, tumor immunotherapy, and autoimmune disease. By
comparing these protocols across a single system (mouse kidney), we are now using
these results to guide our collaborative network on the best approach for their circum-
stances. We are instructing our collaborators to use cold dissociation and freshly profile
samples wherever possible. For clinical samples (where we often need to wait for path-
ology results, or are constrained by how archival material has been stored), we discuss
with the collaborators the different biases of cryopreservation, methanol fixation, or
snRNA-seq from frozen tissue and together decide the best approach. Where informa-
tion on lymphocytes (T, B, NK) is required, we do not currently recommend snRNA-
seq. Researchers will undoubtedly continue to develop new methods aimed to reduce
bias. Given the high cost of these experiments, it is critical that these methods are sys-
tematically compared to allow the community to decide which to adopt.

Methods
Mice
Acknowledging the principles of 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement), all
kidneys used in this study were from mice that were euthanized by cervical dislocation
as parts of other ongoing ethically approved experiments. In the first series of experi-
ments, comparing cold and warm tissue dissociation and two preservation protocols,
male AFAPIL.1DEL C57BL/6J mice from the same litter were used. These mice were
19 weeks old when euthanized and had no exposure to any experimental procedures.
For the subsequent experiments, comparing cold-dissociated scRNA-seq to single-
nuclei isolation protocols, we used untreated 18-week-old male Balb/c mice from the
same litter or untreated 15-week-old female wild type Balb/c mice that were previously
used as breeders, as specified in Additional file 17.
Kidney harvesting
Mice were euthanized and their kidneys were dissected and placed into a 1.5-mL tube
containing 1 mL of ice-cold PBS. The capsules were then removed on ice, and the sam-
ples processed as detailed below.
Warm tissue dissociation
Kidneys were dissociated using the Multi-tissue dissociation kit 2 from Miltenyi Biotec
[130-110-203] as per manufacturers’ instruction, with minor variations. Once the
weight of the kidney was determined, the kidney was quartered and placed into a gen-
tleMACS C-tube [Miltenyi Biotech; 130-096-334] containing the enzyme mix described
in the kit’s protocol. The tube was centrifuged briefly, then placed onto the gentle-
MACS octo dissociator (Miltenyi Biotech), and the 37C_Multi_E program was run after
attaching the heating elements. Following completion of the program, the tube was
briefly centrifuged. Complete tissue dissociation was checked by examining under the
microscope and confirming the absence of visible tissue chunks.
The homogenate was filtered through a 70-μm cell strainer [Greiner; 54,207] into a
50-mL centrifuge tube [Greiner; 227,270], the strainer was then rinsed with 15 mL of
PBS. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 400g for 10 min; once complete, the super-
natant was removed and the pellet was resuspended in 5 mL of PBS + 0.04% BSA
[Sigma; A7638]. The cell suspension was then filtered through a 40-μm strainer [Grei-
ner; 542,040], which was subsequently rinsed with 2 mL of PBS + 0.04% BSA. The cells
were again centrifuged at 400g for 10 min. The supernatant was then removed, and the
pellet was resuspended in 5 mL of PBS + 0.04% BSA. Cell count and viability was esti-
mated using the Countess II FL (Thermo Fisher) and the ReadyProbes Blue/Red kit
[Invitrogen; R37610]. The cells were then diluted to 700 cells/μL and were immediately
loaded onto a 10x chip A and processed on the 10x Chromium controller. The
remaining cells were then either methanol fixed or cryopreserved. Cell viability is avail-
able in Additional file 18.
Cold tissue dissociation
Kidneys were dissociated using a modified version of the published protocol described
in [18]. Based on the weight, in a pre-cooled Miltenyi C-tube, a protease solution (5
Denisenko et al. Genome Biology          (2020) 21:130 
Page 13 of 25
mM CaCl2 [Invitrogen; AM9530G], 10 mg/mL B. Licheniformis protease [Sigma;
P5380], 125 U/mL DNase I [Sigma; D5025], 1xDPBS) was prepared for each kidney.
The kidneys were then minced on ice into a smooth paste using a scalpel. The
minced kidney was transferred into 4–6 mL of the protease solution (dependent on
weight) and triturated using a 1 mL pipette for 15 s every 2 min for a total of 8 min.
Following trituration, the C-tubes were placed onto a Miltenyi gentleMACS octo disso-
ciator in a cool room (4 °C), and the m_brain_03 program was run twice in succession.
Once complete, the samples were triturated for 15 s every 2 min on ice for an additional
16 min using a 1-mL pipette. A total of 10 μL of each sample was then loaded into a
hemocytometer to assess whether tissue dissociation was complete. Complete tissue dis-
sociation was also checked by examining under the microscope and confirming the ab-
sence of visible tissue chunks. The dissociated cells were transferred to a 15-mL
centrifuge tube and 3 mL of ice-cold PBS + 10%FBS [Gibco; A3160401] was added.
The cell suspension was centrifuged at 1200g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was
removed and the pellet was resuspended in 2 mL of PBS + 10%FBS. The cells were then
filtered through a 70-μm cell strainer, which was subsequently rinsed with 2 mL of
PBS + 0.01% BSA. The cells were then centrifuged again at 1200g for 5 min at 4 °C
followed by removal of the supernatant and resuspension of the pellet in 5 mL of PBS +
0.01%BSA. The cells were then filtered through a 40-μm cell strainer, which was subse-
quently rinsed with 2 mL of PBS + 0.01% BSA. The cells were again centrifuged at
1200g for 5 min at 4 °C followed by removal of the supernatant and resuspension of the
cells in 5 mL of PBS + 0.04%BSA. The cells were counted and checked for viability
using the ReadyProbes Blue/Red Kit on the Countess II FL. The cells were further di-
luted to a concentration of 700 cells/μL with PBS/0.04%BSA and loaded directly onto a
10x chip (A/B depending on experiment) and isolated using the 10x Chromium con-
troller. The remaining cells were either methanol fixed or cryopreserved. Cell viability
is available in Additional file 18.
Methanol fixation
Fixing
The methanol-fixation protocol was based on [41]. After tissue dissociation, the cells
were concentrated to approximately 5 × 106 cells/mL by centrifuging at 1000g for 10
min. In total, 200 μL of the cell suspensions was aliquoted into 2-mL cryovials resting
on ice. A total of 800 μL of 100% methanol [Sigma; 494,437] (chilled at −20 °C) was
then added dropwise to each sample while gently stirring the cells to prevent clumping.
The cryovials were stored at −20 °C for 30 min, then directly transferred to −80 °C (no
gradient cooling).
Rehydrating
Cryovials of methanol-fixed cells were removed from −80 °C and placed on ice to
equilibrate to 4 °C (approximately 10 min). The cells were then transferred to a 1.5-mL
centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 1000g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was dis-
carded and the pellet was resuspended in a small volume of SSC cocktail (3xSSC
[Sigma; S0902], 0.04% BSA, 40 mM DTT [Sigma; 43816], 0.5 U/mL RNasin plus [Pro-
mega; N2615]) to reach a concentration of approximately 2000 cells/μL. The cells were

then filtered through a pre-wetted (with 1 mL of nuclease-free water) 40-μm pluristrai-
ner mini filter [PluriSelect; 43-10040]. The cells were counted using the ReadyProbes
Blue/Red Kit on the Countess II, then adjusted to 2000 cells/μL based on the count.
The cells were loaded onto a 10x chip (A/B depending on version used) at a volume
that dilutes the SSC to 0.125x to prevent reverse transcription inhibition. Cell viability
is available in Additional file 18.
Cryopreservation
Freezing
After tissue dissociation, the cells were centrifuged at 400g for 10 min (1200g for 5 min
at 4 °C for the repeated experiment), then resuspended in freezing media (50% FBS,
40% RPMI-1640 [Gibco; 11875093], 10% DMSO [Sigma; D4540]) to achieve a concen-
tration of 1 × 106 cells/mL. One milliliter of the cell suspension was aliquoted into 2-
mL cryovials, then placed into an isopropanol freezing container (Mr. Frosty) and
stored at −80 °C overnight. The following day, the cells were transferred to liquid nitro-
gen storage.
Thawing
The samples were removed from −80 °C and immediately placed into a 37 °C waterbath
for 2–3 min to rapidly thaw. The cells were then mixed using a 1 mL pipette with a
wide-bore tip, and the entire volume was transferred to a 15-mL centrifuge tube [Grei-
ner; 188261]. The cryovial was then rinsed twice with RMPI+ 10%FBS (rinse media);
each time, the 1 mL of media was added to the 15-mL centrifuge in a dropwise manner
while gently shaking the tube. Seven milliliters of rinse media was added to the centri-
fuge tube using a serological pipette—the first 4 mL was added dropwise while gently
shaking the tube, and the following 3 mL added down the side of the tube over 2 s. The
tube was then inverted to mix.
The cells were centrifuged at 300g for 5 min. Once completed, the supernatant was
removed (leaving 1 mL), placed into another 15-mL centrifuge tube and centrifuged at
400g for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded (leaving 1 mL). The pellet from the
supernatant was then resuspended, combined with the pellet in the initial centrifuge
tube, and mixed. Two milliliters of PBS + 0.04% BSA was added to the centrifuge tube
and shaken gently to mix. The cells were then centrifuged again at 400g for 5 min. The
supernatant was discarded leaving 0.5 mL behind. 0.5 mL of PBS + 0.04% BSA was
added to the cells and gently pipette-mixed 10–15 times to fully resuspend. The cells
were then filtered through a pre-wetted (with 1 mL of PBS + 0.04% BSA) 40-μm pluris-
trainer mini filter. A 20 μL aliquot of the cells was used to obtain an estimate of cell
count and viability using the ReadyProbes Blue/Red Kit on the Countess II FL. Based
on the count, the cells were diluted to a concentration of 700 cells/μL. The cells were
then loaded onto a 10x chip (A/B depending on version) and immediately processed on
the 10x Chromium controller.
For the repeated experiment, the above method was altered: Rather than a 300g spin
followed by two 400g spins, two 1200g spins were performed, omitting the second cen-
trifugation step. Cell viability is available in Additional file 18.

Flash freezing of whole kidney
Following the removal of the renal capsule, the kidney was placed into an isopentane
[Sigma; 320404] bath resting on dry ice for 5 min. The temperature of the bath was
maintained between −30 °C and −40 °C. Once frozen, the kidney was placed into a
pre-cooled (on dry ice) cryovial and then buried in dry ice. The process was repeated
for all designated kidneys. The flash-frozen kidneys were then transferred to a −80 °C
freezer for storage.
Single-nuclei isolation
SN_FANS_3x500g
This method is an adaptation of the Frankenstein protocol [42] and the 10x demon-
strated protocol [43].
The kidneys were removed from −80 °C and immediately placed on ice. Each kidney
was then transferred to a 1.5-mL tube containing 300 μL of chilled lysis buffer (10 mM
Tris-HCl [Invitrogen; AM9856], 3 mM MgCl2 [Invitrogen; AM9530G], 10 mM NaCl
[Sigma; 71386], 0.005% Nonidet P40 substitute [Roche; 11754599001], 0.2 U/mL RNa-
sin plus) and incubated on ice for 2 min. The tissue was then completely homogenized
using a pellet pestle [Fisherbrand; FSB12-141-364] using up and down strokes without
twisting. 1.2 mL of chilled lysis buffer was added to the tube and pipette-mixed (wide-
bore). The full volume was then transferred to a pre-cooled 2-mL tube. The homogen-
ate was incubated on ice for 5 min and mixed with a wide-bore tip every 1.5 min.
Following the incubation, 500 μL of the lysis buffer was added to the homogenate,
which was subsequently pipette-mixed and split equally into four 2-mL tubes. One
milliliter of chilled lysis buffer was added to each tube and pipette-mixed using a wide-
bore tip. The four tubes were incubated for a further 5 min on ice, mixing with a wide-
bore tip every 1.5 min. The homogenate from the four tubes was then filtered through
a 40-μm strainer into a pre-cooled 50-ml centrifuge tube. Following this, the sample
was split again into four 2-mL tubes resting on ice.
The samples were centrifuged at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was re-
moved leaving 50 μL in the tube. 1.5 mL of lysis buffer was then added to two of the
tubes and the pellet resuspended by mixing with a pipette. This resulted in two tubes
containing 1.5 mL resuspended nuclei in lysis buffer, and two tubes containing a nuclei
pellet in 50 μL of lysis buffer. The resuspended nuclei in one tube was then combined
with the nuclei pellet of another, resulting in two tubes containing resuspended nuclei
in lysis buffer.
The nuclei were centrifuged again at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was re-
moved completely and discarded. A total of 500 μL of nuclei wash buffer (1xDPBS, 1%
BSA, 0.2 U/mL RNasin plus) was added to the tube containing the pellet and left to in-
cubate without resuspending for 5 min. Following incubation, an additional 1 mL of
nuclei wash buffer was added, and the nuclei were resuspended by gently mixing with a
pipette. The nuclei were again centrifuged at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C, followed by dis-
carding the supernatant. The pellets were resuspended in 1.4 mL of nuclei wash buffer,
then transferred into a pre-cooled 1.5-mL tube. Another 500g centrifugation step for
5 min at 4 °C was performed. The supernatant was then discarded, and the nuclei pellet
was resuspended in 1 mL of nuclei wash buffer.

Page 16 of 25
The nuclei were then filtered through a 4-μm pluristrainer mini filter. A total of
200 μL of the filtered nuclei suspension was transferred into a 0.5-mL tube and set
aside to be used as the unstained control for sorting. To the remaining 800 μL, 8 μL of
DAPI (10 μg/mL) [Thermo Scientific; 62248] was added, and the nuclei were mixed
with a pipette. A quality control step was performed by viewing the nuclei under a
fluorescence microscope on a hemocytometer to check nuclei shape and count.
A BD Influx Cell Sorter was then used to sort 100,000 DAPI-positive events using a
70-μm nozzle and a pressure of 22 psi (as per gating strategy, Additional file 2: Figure
S10). The post-sort nuclei concentration and quality were then checked using a fluores-
cence microscope and hemocytometer. Nuclei were then loaded onto a 10x chip (A/B
depending on version used) and processed immediately on the 10x Chromium
controller.
SN_FANS_1x2000g
The flash-frozen kidneys were removed from −80 °C and transferred to a 1.5-mL tube
containing 500 μL of pre-chilled lysis buffer same recipe as previous protocol) and
allowed to rest on ice for 2 min. Each kidney was then homogenized with a pellet pestle
with 40 up and down strokes without twisting the pellet. The resulting homogenate
was mixed with a pipette and transferred to pre-cooled 15-mL centrifuge tube contain-
ing 2 mL of lysis buffer. The homogenate was incubated for 12 min on ice with mixing
every 2 min using a glass fire-polished silanized Pasteur pipette [Kimble; 63A54]. Once
incubation was complete, 2.5 mL of nuclei wash buffer (same recipe as previous proto-
col) was added to the homogenate. The remaining tissue fragments were completely
dissociated by repeated trituration of the homogenate using the glass Pasteur pipette.
The homogenate was then filtered through a 30-μm MACS Smart Strainer [Miltenyi
Biotech; 130-098-458] into a new 15-mL centrifuge tube. The nuclei were centrifuged
at 2000g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and the nuclei pellet was re-
suspended in 1 mL of nuclei wash buffer. A total of 200 μL was aliquoted into a 0.5-mL
tube to be used as an unstained control for sorting. Eight microliters of DAPI (10 μg/
mL) was added to the remaining 800 μL of nuclei. Quality and quantity of the nuclei
was checked using a fluorescence microscope prior to sorting. Sorting and post sorting
QC was performed in the same manner as for the SN_FANS_3x500g protocol. Nuclei
were then loaded onto a 10x chip B and processed immediately on the 10x Chromium
controller.
SN_sucrose
Kidneys were removed from −80 °C and transferred to a 1.5-mL tube containing
500 μL of pre-chilled lysis buffer II (same recipe as previous protocols, with 125 U/mL
of DNase I added) and allowed to rest on ice for 2 min. Each kidney was then homoge-
nized using a pellet pestle with 40 up and down strokes without twisting. The hom-
ogenate was transferred to a 15-mL centrifuge tube containing 2 mL of lysis buffer II
and incubated for 12 min on ice with mixing every 2 min using a glass fire-polished
silanized Pasteur pipette. Following the incubation, 2.5 mL of nuclei wash buffer II (1×
DPBS + 2%BSA) was added to the homogenate. Remaining tissue clumps were dissoci-
ated by repeated trituration of the homogenate using the glass Pasteur pipette.

Page 17 of 25
The homogenate was then filtered through a 30-μm MACS Smart Strainer into a
new 15-mL centrifuge tube. Subsequently, the homogenate was centrifuged at 2000g
for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in
510 μL of nuclei wash buffer II. Ten microliters of the suspension was transferred to a
1.5-mL tube and placed on ice for use in nuclei recovery calculations. A total of 900 μL
of 1.8 M sucrose solution [Sigma; NUC201] was added to the remaining 500 μL of nu-
clei suspension and homogenized by mixing with a pipette. 3.6 mL of 1.3 M sucrose so-
lution [Sigma; NUC201] was added to a 5-mL tube. The nuclei/sucrose homogenate
was then gently layered on top of the 1.3 M sucrose solution.
The 5-mL tube containing the sucrose solutions and nuclei was then centrifuged at
3000g for 10 min at 4 °C. Once centrifugation was complete, the sucrose phase contain-
ing debris was soaked up using a Kimwipe wrapped around a pellet pestle. The
remaining supernatant was removed and discarded using a pipette. The nuclei pellet
was then resuspended in 5 mL of wash buffer II, of which 10 μL was transferred to a
1.5-mL tube to assess nuclei recovery.
To the 10 μL of nuclei suspension removed prior to the sucrose gradient, 980 μL of
wash buffer II and 10 μL of DAPI (10 μg/mL) was added. To the 10 μL of nuclei sus-
pension removed after the sucrose gradient, 89 μL of wash buffer II and 1 μL of DAPI
(10 μg/mL) was added. The yield from the pre- and post-sucrose aliquots was com-
pared to assess nuclei recovery after filtration through the gradient. The post-sucrose
count was used to dilute the nuclei to a concentration of 700 nuclei/μL, which was im-
mediately loaded onto a 10x chip B and processed with the 10x Chromium controller.
Single-cell RNA-seq library preparation
All single-cell libraries were constructed in biological triplicate using the 10x Chro-
mium 3′ workflow as per the manufacturers’ directions. In the first series of experi-
ments, comparing cold and warm tissue dissociation and two preservation protocols,
version 2 chemistry was used. For single-cell versus single-nuclei comparisons, versions
2 and 3 were used as indicated in Additional file 17. All experiments and conditions
aimed for a capture of approximately 9000 cells, except for methanol-fixed samples.
Due to the reverse transcription inhibition of 3x SSC, the sample had to be loaded at a
concentration of 0.125x SSC, resulting in an approximate cell capture of 4000–5000
cells.
Bulk RNA-seq library preparation
For the undissociated samples, total RNA was extracted from flash-frozen kidneys using
the Nucleospin RNA Midi kit [Macherey Nagel; 740,962.20] as per the manufacturers’
directions. For the dissociated samples, total RNA was extracted from the remaining
cells from each of the tissue dissociation protocols. RNA was assessed for quantity and
quality using the TapeStation 4200 RNA ScreenTape kit [Agilent; 5067-5576], which
showed all RNA used had a RIN of > 8. Bulk RNA-seq was performed using the NEB-
Next Ultra II RNA Library Kit for Illumina [NEB; E7760] and either NEBNext rRNA
Depletion Kit (Human/Mouse/Rat) [NEB; E6310] or NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA isolation
module [NEB; E7490] as described in the manufacturers’ protocol, with 100 ng of total
RNA as input.

Sequencing
All libraries were quantified with qPCR using the NEBnext Library Quant Kit for Illu-
mina and checked for fragment size using the TapeStation D1000 kit (Agilent). The li-
braries were pooled in equimolar concentration for a total pooled concentration of 2
nM. 10x single-cell libraries were sequenced using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 and S2
flow cells (100 cycle kit) with a read one length of 26 cycles, and a read two length of
92 or 98 cycles for version 2 chemistry. Version 3 chemistry had a read one length of
28 cycles, and a read two length of 94 cycles. Bulk libraries were sequenced on the Illu-
mina NovaSeq 6000 using SP flow cells (100 cycle kit) with read length of 150 for disso-
ciated bulk in C57BL/6J mice, 51 for undissociated bulk in Balb/c male mice, and 60
for Balb/c female mice.
Bulk RNA-seq data processing
BCL files were demultiplexed and converted into FASTQ using bcl2fastq utility of Illu-
mina BaseSpace Sequence Hub. FastQC was used for read quality control [44].
Adapters and low-quality bases were trimmed using Trim Galore with parameters
--paired --quality 5 --stringency 5 --length 20 --max_n 10 [45]. Reads matching to ribo-
somal DNA repeat sequence BK000964 [46] and low complexity reads were removed
with TagDust2 [47]. The remaining reads were mapped to GRCm38.84 version of
mouse genome using STAR version 2.6.1a with default settings [48]. Picard MarkDupli-
cates tool was employed to identify duplicates [49]. FeatureCounts was then used to de-
rive gene count matrix [50]. Counts were normalized to gene length and then to library
sizes using weighted trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) method in edgeR [27], to de-
rive gene length corrected trimmed mean of M-values (GeTMM) as described in [29].
scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq data processing
BCL files were demultiplexed and converted into FASTQ using bcl2fastq utility of Illu-
mina BaseSpace Sequence Hub. scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq libraries were processed
using Cell Ranger 2.1.1 with mm10-2.1.0 reference. Reads mapped to exons were used for
scRNA-seq samples, whereas both intronic and exonic reads were counted for snRNA-
seq. Custom pre-mRNA reference for snRNA-seq was built as described in [51]. Raw
gene-barcode matrices from Cell Ranger output were used for downstream processing.
Cells were distinguished from background noise using EmptyDrops [52]. Only genes de-
tected in a minimum of 10 cells were retained; cells with 200–3000 genes and under 50%
of mitochondrial reads were retained, as per Park et al. study [32]. Nuclei were addition-
ally filtered to have at least 450 UMIs for v2 chemistry and 900 UMIs for v3 chemistry,
and mitochondrial genes were removed. Outlier cells with high ratio of number of de-
tected UMI to genes (> 3 median absolute deviations from median) were removed using
Scater [53]. Seurat v2 was used for sample integration (canonical correlation analysis),
normalization (dividing by the total counts, multiplying by 10,000 and natural-log trans-
forming), scaling, clustering, and differential expression analysis (Wilcoxon test) [30].
Inferring cell identity
To infer cell identity for freshly profiled samples in the first series of experiments, we
performed a reference-based annotation using scMatch [31] and refined cell labels
Denisenko et al. Genome Biology          (2020) 21:130 
Page 19 of 25
based on marker gene expression in a two-step procedure described below (Add-
itional file 2: Figure S1).
Reference dataset
To construct the reference dataset for scMatch [31], we obtained gene counts and cell
types reported in three single-cell (or single-nuclei) adult mouse kidney studies [26, 32,
33]. Counts were normalized to cell library size and averaged within each cell type to
derive reference vectors (Additional file 2: Figure S1, Step 1). The reference vectors
were clustered using Spearman correlation coefficient, and five vectors were removed
as outliers. The remaining 66 vectors composed a reference dataset, available as Add-
itional file 19. With this reference dataset, we ran scMatch [31] (Additional file 2: Fig-
ure S1, Step 2) using options --testMethod s --keepZeros y to label each individual cell
with the closest cell type identity from the reference dataset.
Refining cell identities
We next refined scMatch-derived cell types based on gene expression. First, for each
cell type, we calculated gene signatures as genes overexpressed in the given cell type
when compared to all other cells (FindMarkers function of Seurat [30], minimum de-
tection rate of 0.5, logFC threshold of 1 and FDR < 0.05 were used as thresholds; only
cell types with at least 10 cells were considered; Additional file 2: Figure S1, Step 3).
Second, cell type gene signature scores were calculated for each cell and for each gene
signature (AddModuleScore function of Seurat [30], genes attributed to signatures in
more than two cell types were excluded; Additional file 2: Figure S1, Step 4). Third, we
used these scores to assign cell types to cells (Additional file 2: Figure S1, Step 5). A cell
type was assigned to a cell if the score for that cell type was the highest among all cell
types, positive and significant with FDR < 0.05. Significance was determined in a
Monte-Carlo procedure with 1000 randomly selected gene sets of the same size [54],
correction for multiple hypothesis testing was performed using Benjamini-Hochberg
procedure [55]. Cells without cell type annotation were manually explored to identify
whether the corresponding cell type might be a novel one, absent from the reference.
Second iteration
Cell types inferred in our dataset were added to the reference dataset (Additional file 2:
Figure S1, Step 6), and annotation with scMatch and gene set signature scoring was re-
peated. Cells left unannotated at this stage were labelled as “unknown.” Cell type gene
signatures are available in Additional file 20.
This approach failed to identify cells of connecting tubule (CNT) and, instead, matched
them to other similar cell types. To resolve this, annotation for cell types labelled as DCT,
aLOH, CD_IC, CD_PC, and CD_Trans was additionally refined as follows. These cells
were extracted from the dataset and clustered separately. Candidate CNT cells were iden-
tified as a cluster overexpressing Calb1 and Klk1 genes [34, 56]. The cell type signature
score procedure was then applied for this subset as described above.
Cell type labels assigned to each cell are available in Additional file 3.

Preserved cells
Cells of preserved single-cell suspensions from the first series of experiments were an-
notated using the cell type gene signatures derived from the corresponding freshly pro-
filed samples (Additional file 20) and the gene set signature scoring procedure
described above. Cell type labels assigned to each cell are available in Additional file 3.
Subsequent experiments
In subsequent experiments, we used a combined reference dataset, which included the
public data as well as data from freshly profiled cells generated in the first series of ex-
periments (Additional file 21, note that two cell types were excluded from the reference
as outliers). Single-cell datasets were annotated using a single iteration of scMatch. For
single-nucleus datasets, we repeated the two-step annotation procedure described
above. Cell type labels assigned to each cell or nucleus are available in Additional file 3.
Stress response score
To select genes for the stress response score, we looked at all genes induced in the
warm-dissociated samples, and from that list, we manually selected genes which have
been reported in the literature as stress-response-related genes. Stress response score
was calculated for 17 genes (Fosb, Fos, Jun, Junb, Jund, Atf3, Egr1, Hspa1a, Hspa1b,
Hsp90ab1, Hspa8, Hspb1, Ier3, Ier2, Btg1, Btg2, Dusp1) for each cell using AddModule-
Score function of Seurat version 2 [30]. The score represents an average expression
level of these genes on a single-cell level, subtracted by the aggregated expression of
control gene sets. All analyzed genes were binned based on averaged expression, and
the control genes were randomly selected from each bin. Significance was determined
in a Monte-Carlo procedure with 1000 randomly selected sets of 17 genes [54], correc-
tion for multiple hypothesis testing was performed using Benjamini-Hochberg proced-
ure [55].
Cell cycle phase prediction
Cell cycle phases were inferred using CellCycleScoring function of Seurat version 2 [30]
with the following genes: S-genes: Atad2, Blm, Brip1, Casp8ap2, Ccne2, Cdc45, Cdc6,
Cdca7, Chaf1b, Clspn, Dscc1, Dtl, E2f8, Exo1, Fen1, Gins2, Gmnn, Hells, Mcm2, Mcm4,
Mcm5, Mcm6, Msh2, Nasp, Pcna, Pcna-ps2, Pola1, Pold3, Prim1, Rad51ap1, Rfc2,
Rpa2, Rrm1, Rrm2, Slbp, Tipin, Tyms, Ubr7, Uhrf1, Ung, Usp1, Wdr76; G2M-genes:
Anln, Anp32e, Aurka, Aurkb, Birc5, Bub1, Cbx5, Ccnb2, Cdc20, Cdc25c, Cdca2, Cdca3,

Top2a, Tpx2, Ttk, Tubb4b, Ube2c. Note cells not annotated as S or G2M phase are by
default labelled as G1 phase.
Bulk RNA-seq deconvolution
BSEQ-sc was used for bulk expression deconvolution [35]. In the first series of experi-
ments, marker genes for the deconvolution were calculated from scRNA-seq data, using
only
cold-dissociated
samples
to

dissociation-related biases. We also excluded cells labelled as “Unknown” and “CD_
Trans” from the calculation. For each of the remaining cell types, marker genes were
calculated using Seurat function FindMarkers with the following thresholds: logfc.thres-
hold = 1.5, min.pct = 0.5, only.pos = T. Genes identified in more than one cell type were
removed, and the remaining genes were used for the deconvolution. The same set of
genes was used to deconvolve all bulk RNA-seq libraries.
