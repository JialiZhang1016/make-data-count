ABSTRACT
Abnormal alterations in the expression and biological function of retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRa) have a
key role in the development of cancer. Potential modulators of RXRa as anticancer agents are explored in
growing numbers of studies. A series of (4/3-(pyrimidin-2-ylamino)benzoyl)hydrazine-1-carboxamide/carbo-
thioamide derivatives are synthesised and evaluated for anticancer activity as RXRa antagonists in this
study. Among all synthesised compounds, 6A shows strong antagonist activity (half maximal effective con-
centration (EC50) ¼ 1.68 ± 0.22 mM), potent anti-proliferative activity against human cancer cell lines HepG2
and A549 cells (50% inhibition of cell viability (IC50) values < 10 mM), and low cytotoxic property in normal
cells such as LO2 and MRC-5 cells (IC50 values > 100mM). Further bioassays indicate that 6A inhibits 9-cis-
RA-induced activity in a dose-dependent manner, and selectively binds to RXRa-¼LBD with submicromolar
affinity (Kd ¼ 1.20  107 M). 6A induces time-and dose-dependent cleavage of poly ADP-ribose polymer-
ase, and significantly stimulates caspase-3 activity, leading to RXRa-dependent apoptosis. Finally, molecular
docking studies predict the binding modes for RXRa-LBD and 6A.

1. Introduction
Retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRa) is a ligand-dependent transcrip-
tion factor of the nuclear receptor superfamily, and it is composed
of A/B region (modulating N-terminal domain or AF-1 domain),
DNA-binding domain (DBD), hinge region, and ligand-binding
domain (LBD)1–3. RXRa forms dimers with itself or other nuclear
receptors such as the thyroid hormone receptor (TR), retinoic acid
receptor (RAR), vitamin D receptor (VDR), liver X receptor (LXR),
and peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), to exert its
transcriptional activities in the nucleus and act biologically in the

cytoplasm4–7. It’s worth noting that RXRa dimers are activated by
endogenous ligand binding to its LBD, and then regulates gene
expression in various biological processes8,9. Besides, dysregula-
tions of RXRa expression and function are implicated in the initi-
ation and development of many cancers1,10–12. So exogenous
RXRa modulators may obstruct the development of various cancer
and diseases. Experiments have shown that agonist can activate
RXRa and upregulated the expression of CDKN1A (a target gene
of RXR), resulting in p21WAF1/CIP1-dependent cell apoptosis and
suppressing cell proliferation13,14, while synthetic antagonists can
promote
mitochondria-mediated
apoptosis
and
inflamma-
tion10,15,16, or induce TNFa-dependent apoptosis through sup-
pressing PI3K/AKT-mediated cell survival pathway17,18. In a word,
previous studies have suggested a potential role for RXRa in can-
cer initiation and cancer therapy.
In recent years, increasing RXRa modulators including many
agonists and few antagonists were identified based on virtual
screening and structure-based design19–21. Among them, only
Bexarotene (an RXR full agonist) has been clinically used for the
treatment of cancers such as Cutaneous T cell lymphoma22.
However, synthetic RXRa ligands reported are associated with
unacceptable toxicity or undesirable side effects23. For example,
Bexarotene has adverse effects such as elevation of blood trigly-
ceride, weight gain, and hepatomegaly24,25. So, the current chal-
lenge is to develop a variety of novel RXRa modulator with more
potent, high specific and low cytotoxic properties.
In this work, to explored novel RXRa antagonists, a series of
new (3/4-(pyrimidin-2-ylamino)benzoyl)-based hydrazine-1-carbox-
amide/carbothioamide derivatives were designed based on the
structures of compounds NSC-640358 and 24 (Figure 1). First, we
fused 4-substituted pyrimidine (replacing 3-phenyl-1H-pyrazole
moiety in NSC-640358) to 2-benzoylhydrazine-1-carboxamide (as a
substitute for (E)-N’-benzylideneacetohydrazide moiety in com-
pound 24) to build the scaffold structure of target compounds.
Second, to obtain potent RXRa antagonists, we modified the two
moiety structures such as introducing the aryl group to the C-4
position (R1) of pyrimidine ring, introducing the alkyl/aryl/aralkyl
group to the nitrogen atom of carboxamide (R2), and synthesising
carboxamide or carbothioamide derivatives (X). Next, we synthes-
ised target compounds and evaluated their biological activities
such as in vitro antiproliferative activity and modulating RXRa
activity. Then, we attempt to establish the preliminary structur-
e  activity relationships, and the selected compound 6 A as a
new high potent RXRa antagonist was further investigated for the
RXRa-dependent apoptosis induction including inhibition of RXRa
transactivation, physical binding of 6A to RXRa-LBD, and induction
of cell apoptosis, and checking the level of cleaved poly ADP-
ribose polymerase (c-PARP) and caspase-3. At last, a molecular
docking study was performed to explore the binding nature of 6A
to the ligand-binding pocket (LBP) of RXRa with antagonistic con-
formation (PDB: 3A9E).
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Chemistry
The synthetic strategy of target compounds (Series A andB) is
depicted in Scheme 1. Commercially available ketones 1a–1e were
reacted with N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal (DMF-DMA)
in dry toluene at 110 C for 18 h to give corresponding compounds
3a–3e. Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (2a) and ethyl 3-aminobenzoate
(2b) were refluxed with cyanamide in the presence of concentrated
HCl for 24 h in ethanol, and then treated with ammonium nitrate to
afford 4-guanidino benzoic acid ethyl ester nitrate (4a) and 3-gua-
nidino benzoic acid ethyl ester nitrate (4b), respectively. Reactions
of 4a with 3-(dimethylamino)-1-arylprop-2-en-1-ones (3a–3e) in the
presence of sodium hydroxide were performed under reflux condi-
tions in ethanol for 48 h to produce 4-((4-arylpyrimidin-2-yl)amino)-
benzoic acids, followed by refluxing with hydrazine hydrate in
ethanol to get corresponding aroylhydrzides 5a–5e. Finally, target
compounds of series A were prepared via reactions between aroyl-
hydrzides 5a–5e with different isocyanates or isothiocyanates. On
the other hand, target compounds of series B were synthesised
with 4b instead of 4a in a similar method.

To explore the antitumor activity of the target compounds, all
synthesised target compounds were first assayed for in vitro
antiproliferative activities against two human cancer cell lines
(HepG2 and A549) by MTT method with Sorafenib as a reference.
The concentrations of compounds required for 50% inhibition of
cell viability (IC50) were determined and listed in Tables 1 and 2.

derivatives were summarised in Figure 2: (1) First, the R1 substitu-
ent is crucial to the antitumor activities. As shown in Table 1, urea
derivatives with 4-pyridyl at the R1-position showed stronger anti-
proliferative activity than those with 3-pyridyl and 2-pyridyl (6a vs.
6i and 6m, 6d vs. 6j and 6o, 6e vs. 6k, 6h vs. 6l, and 6b vs. 6n).
The synthesised thiourea derivatives 6A–6J possessed a similar
SAR, with the 4-pyridyl group to the C-4 position (R1) of pyrimi-
dine ring being the better substitution. 4-Pyridyl substitution at R1
position was also better than 4-chlorophenyl and phenyl substitu-
tions (6b vs. 6t, 6A vs. 6I, 6A vs. 6G, and 6B vs. 6H). (2) For the
substituent R2 of compounds (6a6h) which contained 4-pyridyl
group at R1 position, it was found that both compounds 6a–6d
bearing alkyl groups (n-Butyl, t-Butyl, Cyclohexyl, and Cyclopentyl)
and 6h having an aralkyl group (phenethyl) generally had good
anti-proliferative properties, while the R2 analogues 6e (p-Tolyl), 6f
(2,4-Difluorophenyl), and 6g (3-Chloro-4-methylphenyl) exhibited
different cytotoxicity due to their different substituted phenyl ring
at the R2-position. A comparison of the activities of compounds
6e and 6f shows that the p-Tolyl substitution is better than
2,4-Difluorophenyl, but when 3-Chloro-4-methylphenyl was intro-
duced into the molecule, the biological activity of 6g was signifi-
cantly
reduced.
Among
the
synthesised
thiourea
derivatives
(6A–6J), compounds with one aralkyl group (benzyl) at R2-position
displayed the better cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells than those
with one aryl group (phenyl) such as 6B vs. 6A, 6E vs. 6D, and 6J
vs 6I. (3) The various scaffold had a certain influence on antitumor
activity. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, replacement of the 4-(pyrimi-
din-2-ylamino)benzohydrazide scaffold with the 3-(pyrimidin-2-yla-
mino)benzohydrazide tended to decrease the activity (7a vs. 6b,
7b vs. 6d, 7d vs. 6i, and 7f vs. 6m).

Identification
of
novel
RXRa
modulators
from
tar-
get compounds
RXRa is an attractive target for the treatment of cancer and we’d
like to discover new potential modulators of RXRa as anticancer
agents. So, all target compounds were evaluated for their effect
on regulating RXRa transcriptional function using a luciferase tran-
scription assay in HEK293T cells with the Gal4- RXRa/LBD chimaera
and Gal4 reporter system. When tested at 1.0 lM concentration
with absence 9-cis-RA in this system, no compound exhibited
increase transcriptional activity, suggesting no agonist effect for
them. However, 11 compounds (6c, 6e, 6k, 6A, 6B, 6C, 6D, 6E,
6F, 6G, and 6H) of series A showed good antagonist effect on
9cis-RA-induced RXRa transactivation with an inhibition of >50%
(Figure 3), while target compounds of series B exhibited little
antagonist effect on 9-cis-RA-induced reporter activity, indicating
4-(pyrimidin-2-ylamino)benzohydrazide scaffold being crucial to
the transcriptional activity of RXRa. Among these candidate com-
pounds, compound 6A showed the strongest inhibition activity 9-
cis-RA-induced Gal4-DBD-RXRa-LBD transactivation at the tested
concentration (1.0 lM). To confirm the antagonist effect of these
11 potential antagonists of RXRa, we next used a retinoid X recep-
tor response element (RXRE)-luciferase reporter-based assay to
evaluate their half maximal effective concentration (EC50) values of
the inhibition on 9-cis-RA-induced RXRE-luciferase reporter activa-
tion. As shown in Table 3, many of them (6k, 6A, 6B, 6C, 6G, and
6H) showed good antagonism with EC50 less than 10.0 lM, while
the EC50 values of several compounds (6c, 6e, 6D, and 6E) could
not be calculated. Furthermore, we evaluated the cytoxic effect of
the six potent RXRa antagonists (EC50 < 10.0 lM) on two normal
cell lines to determine their safety (Table 3). Among the six tested
compounds, 6A showed low cytotoxic property to both LO2 and
MRC-5 with both IC50 values more than 100 lM.

2.2.3. 6A binds to RXRa and acts as an antagonist
Compound 6A displayed low cytotoxic property, potent antiproli-
ferative
(IC50 < 5.30 lM)
and
high
antagonistic
(EC50
¼
1.68 ± 0.22 lM) effects, so compound 6A was selected for further
biological study. Compound 6A was assessed in a dose-dependent
reporter gene assay. As shown in Figure 4(A,B), compound 6A
showed the dose-dependent effect on inhibiting the 9-cis-RA-
induced Gal4-DBD-RXRa-LBD transactivation and 9-cis-RA-induced
RXRE-luciferase reporter activation, and it at 2.0 lM displayed a
similar inhibitory effect when compared with UVI3003 (1.0 lM), a
known RXRa classical antagonist. In order to confirm compound
6A as RXRa ligand, we then performed a surface plasmon reson-
ance (SPR) technology-based experiment to directly measure the
physical binding of compound 6A to RXRa-LBD protein. As shown
in Figure 4(C), we found that 6 A dose dependently bound to
RXRa-LBD with a Kd value of 1.20  107 M. Furthermore, we
measured the physical binding of compound 6A to other nuclear
receptors (ERa-LBD, PPARc-LBD, and TR3-LBD). The results showed
that compound 6A could not bound to these tested nuclear
receptors well (Figure 3(D–F)). This implied that compound 6A
was able to selectively interact with RXRa.
2.2.4. 6A induces RXRa-dependent apoptosis of cancer cells
Previous studies showed RXRa antagonists with anticancer activity
could induce apoptotic cell death. So, we studied whether the
inhibitory effect of 6A on the growth of cancer cells was caused
by cellular apoptosis. First, we examined the expression of c-PARP
(an apoptosis-related protein) in several cancer cell lines treated

pG5-luc (50ng) were tested. Luciferase activities were measured 12 h after treatment using the dual-luciferase assay system kit and Renilla luciferase values were nor-
malised to firefly luciferase activity and plotted as relative luciferase activity.

markedly in HepG2 and Hela cells after treatment with 6A at
3.0 lM for 12 h, whereas 6A at the same concentration has a weak
effect on PARP cleavage in SW620 and LS174T cells. A time- and

cells after treatment with 6A (Figure 5(B)). To address the role of

RXRa knockout A549 cells (PX330-KO). Comparison of the obvious
effect of 6A in normal A549 cells (PX330), 6A showed little effect
on inducing PARP cleavage in RXRa knockout A549 cells (PX330-
KO; Figure 5(C)). Thus, 6A could induce RXRa-dependent PARP
cleavage in cancer cells.
To further confirm the role of RXRa in the apoptosis induction
by 6A, we evaluated the apoptosis effect of compound 6A in
Figure 7. The effect of 6A on caspase-3 activation. A549 and RXRa-/- A549 cells were treated with or without 6A for 12 h, then stained with cleaved-caspase 3 anti-
body and DAPI and assessed by immunofluorescence.

A549 and RXRa knockout A549 cells. As observed in Figure 6(A),
6A-treated A549 cells exhibited obvious apoptosis characteristics
with the accumulation of the nuclear convolution and fragmenta-
tion in membrane-enclosed bodies, but little apoptotic bodies
were detected in treated RXRa knockout A549 cells. Meanwhile,
Figure 6(B) showed that when A549 cells were incubated with 6A
at 10.0 lM, the percentage of apoptotic cells was strikingly ele-
vated to 30.8% from the control group (5.96%). However, the per-
centages of apoptotic cells in RXRa knockout A549 cells without
and with 6A treatment were 2.07 and 2.72%, respectively. These
results demonstrated that apoptosis cells increased significantly
after the treatment of 6A in A549 cells, and the apoptosis induc-
tion of 6A was mainly through RXRa-dependent pathways. It indi-
cates the expression of RXRa plays a role in the apoptosis
induction by 6A.
Finally, to find out whether the apoptotic induction of 6A is
dependent on caspase pathway, we next used immunofluores-
cence assay to evaluate the effect of 6A on the activation of cas-
pase-3 a major executioner caspase known to cleave PARP. As
shown in Figure 7, 6A treatment of A549 cells resulted in the
strong activation of caspase-3 and nuclear shrinkage compared
with control cells, whereas there is no significant difference
between treated and untreated RXR-/- A549 cells. This result was
consistent with c-PARP. It suggests that compound 6A induces
cell death in A549 cells via caspase-dependent pathway and RXRa
dependent pathway.
2.3. Molecular docking studies
Based on the antagonist effect of 6A on RXRa, the molecular
docking of 6A with antagonistic conformation of RXRa (PDB:
3A9E) was performed using Schrodinger 2015.1 Glide protocol to
explore their binding mode. The docking study showed that 6A
was well accommodated into LBP of RXRa (see Figure 8(A) and
Supplementary movie). The docking results predict the binding
features of 6A with RXRa. First, the right 4-(pyridin-4-yl)pyrimidine
portion of compound 6A occupies the sub-pocket formed by
hydrophobic
aromatic
amino
acid
residues
LEU438,
LEU331,
ALA276, PHE318, and TRP310, the pyridine ring forming p–p inter-
action
with
PHE318.
Second,
the
hydrazine-1-carbothioamide
structure locates at the polar region involving HID440. Third, the
left phenyl group of Compound 6A is directed to the protein-solv-
ent interface and makes hydrophobic interactions with surround-
ing lipophilic amino acids such as VAL347 and PHE443. These
findings may provide a direction for the further modifications of
this new class of RXRa regulator.
3. Conclusion
In
summary,
2-(4-(pyrimidin-2-yl)amino)benzoyl)hydrazine-1-car-
boxamide/carbothioamide (Series A) and 2-(3-(pyrimidin-2-yl)ami-
no)benzoyl)
hydrazine-1-carboxamide/carbothioamide
(Series
B)
derivatives were first synthesised and evaluated as potential anti-
tumour agents targeting RXRa. Compounds 6c, 6e, 6h, 6A, and 6J
exhibited potent antiproliferative activity with IC50 values of lower
than 15 lM against two human tumour cell lines, while com-
pounds 6k, 6A, 6B, 6C, 6G, and 6H were identified as good
antagonists of RXRa with EC50 values of lower than 10.0 lM at
RXRE-luciferase reporter-based assay. Compound 6A with the low
cytotoxity of normal cells was identified as the most potent anti-
cancer agent targeting RXRa. Moreover, it was found that the rep-
resentative compound 6A effectively induced RXRa-dependent
apoptosis of cancer cells in a time- and concentration- dependent
manner. SPR technology-based experiment confirmed that com-
pound 6A could selectively bind to RXRa-LBD with a Kd value of
1.20  107 M, and molecular docking analysis showed that com-
pound 6A could bind to the LBP of RXRa like the classical RXRa
antagonists. Taken together, this class of synthetic compounds
may be served as a good starting point to design and synthesise
new RXRa antagonists, and further studies of compound 6A on
activity in vivo would be considered in the future.

4.2. Bioassay
All
the
human
cancer
cell
lines
were
purchased
from
the
American type culture collection (ATCC, Shanghai, China). Goat
antirabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to
horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was obtained from Thermo Fisher
Scientific (Waltham, MA), anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Cy3
from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA), anti-RXRa (D-20, sc-
553) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-PARP
(46D11, 9542) and anti-Clevage Caspase 3 (Asp175, 9661S) from
Cell Signalling Technology (Boston, MA), anti-a-tublin antibody
from Proteintech (Rosemont, IL), and JC-1 Probe (Cat. T3168) from
Thermo Fisher Scientific.
4.2.1. Cell culture and transfection
SW620, LS174T, HepG2, and A549 were maintained in Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagles Medium supplemented with 10% foetal bovine
serum (FBS), HeLa was maintained in Modified Eagles Medium
supplemented with 10% FBS and were cultured at 37 C, under
90% humidity with 5% carbon-di-oxide (CO2).
4.2.2. Antiproliferative activity assay
The logarithmic phase of HepG2 and A549 cells were seeded in 96-
well plates at about 1 104 cells per well. treated with various con-
centrations of compounds for 24 h. then 15lL MTT was added and
incubated for 4h at 37C and 5% CO2. the light intensity was meas-
ured by microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) at a wave-
length of 490nm. Experiments were repeated three times. The
results were analysed by GraphPad Prism 5.01 software, La Jolla, CA.
4.2.3. Luciferase reporter gene assay
HEK293T cells were cotransfected with pG5-luc reporter (50.0 ng)
and Pbind-RXRa-LBD (50.0 ng). One day after transfection, cells
were treated with DMSO, compounds (1 lM) or 9-cis-RA (0.1 lM).
After 12 h, cells were lysed and quantitated using the Dual-
Luciferase
Reporter
Assay
System
(Thermo
Fisher
Scientific).
Transfection and expression efficiency were normalised to Renilla
luciferase activity.
4.2.4. RXRE-mediated transcription assay
HEK293T cells were seeded into 48-well plates at 40% confluence
and cotransfected with RXRE luciferase reporter gene (100.0 ng),
Myc-RXRa (50.0 ng), and Renilla control plasmid (1.0 ng). After 24 h
post transfection, the compounds or vehicle were added. Cells
were harvested after 12 h of incubation with ligands and then
quantitated using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System
(Promega). Luminescence of firefly luciferase values was normal-
ised to the Renilla luciferase activity.
4.2.5. EC50 determination
The EC50 values were determined from full dose-response curves
for compounds tested ranging from 0.10 to 20.0 lM. HEK293T cells
were plated, transfected, and treated as above using Luciferase
Reporter Gene Assay. Then cells were treated with DMSO vehicle
(0.1%) or compounds tested (final concentration of 0.1, 0.3125,
0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, and 20.0 lM) for 24 h. The amount of
rexinoid activity at each concentration was measured using the
same luciferase assay described above and EC50 values were
derived from dose-response curves of ligand concentration versus
normalised luciferase activity using Graph Pad Prism 5 software.
4.2.6. Western blot analysis
Equal amounts of cell lysates were boiled in sodium dodecyl sul-
phate (SDS) sample loading buffer, then separated through 10%
SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electro transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5%
non-fat milk in 10 mM TriseHCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 0.05%
Tween 20 (TBST) buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The mem-
branes were incubated overnight at 4 C, with specific primary anti-
bodies, after washing, followed by incubated with HRP-conjugated
anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies, immunoreactive
products were visualised with a chemiluminescence solution.
4.2.7. Generation of RXRa knock-out cell by CRISPR/Cas9 system
For RXRa genes, sgRNAs were designed based on the original Cas9
approach. Then RXRa sgRNA were colonised into gRNA cloning vec-
tor PX330 (add gene 71707) and confirmed by sequencing. The
cells were infected with control vector and gRNA expression vec-
tors for 24 h and selected single colonies using G418 (0.5 mg/mL).
The knockout cell was determined using western blot analysis
4.2.8. SPR
BIAcore-T200 machine (GE Healthcare) was used to measure the
binding kinetics of compound 6A with RXRa-LBD, ERa-LBD, PPARc-
LBD, and TR3-LBD. Purified RXRa-LBD, ERa-LBD, PPARc-LBD, and
TR3-LBD were respectively immobilised on the CM5 chips accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s instructions. Then various concentrations
of 6A was injected into the flow cells in running buffer (phos-
phate buffer saline (PBS), 0.4% DMSO) at a flow rate of 30.0 lL/
min, when all cycle were collected, The results were analysed
using Biacore T200 Evaluation Software.
4.2.9. Analysis of mitochondrial membrane potential
For detection of apoptosis by FACS, A549 cells were incubated
with 6A at 3.0 lM for 12 h. After treatment, the cells were har-
vested and washed with PBS followed by stained with JC-1 for
30 min at room temperature in the dark, Flow-cytometric analysis
was performed using FACS.

4.2.10. Immunofluorescence microscopy
A549 cells were seeded on glass cover slips, incubated for 12 h in
the presence of compound 6A at a final concentration of 3.0 lM.
Cells mounted on glass slides were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
and permeabilised with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and
0.10 mol/l glycine for 10 min, and then blocked with 1% bovine
serum albumin in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, followed
with incubation with cleaved-caspase 3 antibodies (1:100) at room
temperature for 2 h, and detected by anti-rabbit IgG conjugated
with Cy3 (1:200) at room temperature for 2 h. Cells were contained
with 4’60-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (1:10,000) to visualise
nuclei. The images were analysed by using MRC-1024 MP laser-
scanning confocal microscope (Leica).
4.3. Molecular docking studies
The
molecular
docking
studies
were
performed
with
the
Schrodinger 2015.1 Glide26. The crystal structure of RXRa (PDB
code: 3A9E) were downloaded from the RCSB protein data bank
and prepared with Protein Preparation Wizard panel as imple-
mented in Maestro 10.5: water molecules were removed, missing
hydrogens and residues were added. The glide grid centre was
setting according the geometrical centre of original inhibitor
(LG100754) and the grid size was 20  20  20 Å3. Compound 6A
were prepared with LigPrep panel with OPLS2005 force field, gen-
erating the protonation and tautomeric states at 7 ± 2 pH units27.
Compound 6A was docked into the RXRa binding site using Glide
in XP mode. All of docking results were processed maestro 10.1
and PyMOL software.
