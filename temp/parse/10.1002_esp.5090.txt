Abstract
The 20 May 2016 MW 6.1 Petermann earthquake in central Australia generated a
21 km surface rupture with 0.1 to 1 m vertical displacements across a low-relief
landscape. No paleo-scarps or potentially analogous topographic features are evident
in pre-earthquake Worldview-1 and Worldview-2 satellite data. Two excavations
across the surface rupture expose near-surface fault geometry and mixed aeolian-
sheetwash sediment faulted only in the 2016 earthquake. A 10.6 ± 0.4 ka optically
stimulated luminescence (OSL) age of sheetwash sediment provides a minimum
estimate for the period of quiescence prior to 2016 rupture. Seven cosmogenic
beryllium-10 (10Be) bedrock erosion rates are derived for samples < 5 km distance
from the surface rupture on the hanging-wall and foot-wall, and three from samples
19 to 50 km from the surface rupture. No distinction is found between fault proximal
rates (1.3 ± 0.1 to 2.6 ± 0.2 m Myr−1) and distal samples (1.4 ± 0.1 to 2.3 ± 0.2 m
Myr−1). The thickness of rock fragments (2–5 cm) coseismically displaced in the
Petermann earthquake perturbs the steady-state bedrock erosion rate by only 1 to
3%, less than the erosion rate uncertainty estimated for each sample (7–12%). Using
10Be erosion rates and scarp height measurements we estimate approximately 0.5 to
1 Myr of differential erosion is required to return to pre-earthquake topography. By
inference any pre-2016 fault-related topography likely required a similar time for
removal. We conclude that the Petermann earthquake was the first on this fault in
the last ca. 0.5–1 Myr. Extrapolating single nuclide erosion rates across this timescale
introduces large uncertainties, and we cannot resolve whether 2016 represents the
first ever surface rupture on this fault, or a > 1 Myr interseismic period. Either option
reinforces the importance of including distributed earthquake sources in fault dis-
placement and seismic hazard analyses.

INTRODUCTION
Estimates of the slip rate and recurrence intervals for surface-
rupturing faults are critical inputs to probabilistic fault displacement
(e.g., Coppersmith & Youngs, 2000; Moss & Ross, 2011) and seismic
hazard analyses (e.g., Allen et al., 2020; Stirling et al., 2012).
Commonly, surface rupture traces and/or related surface deformation
features (e.g., fault scarps, folds) produced in contemporary and/or
pre-historic (‘paleo’) earthquakes are excavated by hand or machine
to expose subsurface structural–stratigraphic relationships, from
which earthquake displacements and chronologies may be character-
ized (e.g., Khajavi et al., 2016; Sieh, 1978; Stahl et al., 2016). Near-
surface fault exposures in natural settings (e.g., stream cut-banks;
Quigley et al., 2006; Sandiford, 2003) and progressive offsets of sur-
face features (e.g., stream channels and terraces; Amos et al., 2011;
Gold et al., 2017; Little et al., 2010) may also be utilized for this pur-
pose. Determination of an earthquake recurrence interval requires
estimates of the timing of multiple discrete seismic displacements,
although other approaches that combine geodetic and seismologic
data, slip rates, and earthquake scaling parameters are also used
(e.g., Atwater et al., 2003; Dixon et al., 2003; Leonard & Clark, 2011;
Nicol et al., 2016; Zielke, 2018). The accuracy and precision with
which recurrence intervals may be estimated depends on many fac-
tors, including (i) the suitability of fault-related sediments and surface
features for age dating, (ii) the analytical uncertainties associated with
the age data, (iii) the epistemic uncertainties associated with interpre-
tation and attribution of structural–stratigraphic data to distinct earth-
quakes at distinct times, and (iv) the assumption that the geologic
record is a complete archive of seismic activity on the studied fault(s).
Many paleoseismic studies are limited by several of these factors.
Australia has experienced 11 surface-rupturing earthquakes since
1968 (King et al., 2019; and references cited therein) that collectively
comprise the richest domestic intraplate record of historical reverse-
fault surface ruptures globally. Five of these earthquakes have been
investigated using machine-dug (Clark & Edwards, 2018; Crone et al.,
1997) or hand-dug (Clark et al., 2014, 2020; Lewis et al., 1981; this
study)
excavations
combined
with
the
structural–stratigraphic
approaches outlined earlier. For four of these five events, structural
and stratigraphic evidence for paleo-earthquakes is not recorded in
the exposed Quaternary/Tertiary sediments and/or Precambrian
bedrock. In one case, the Lake Surprise East (Tennant Creek) rupture
(Crone et al., 1992), the excavated trench exposed a pre-existing bed-
rock scarp of ambiguous origin, and a non-seismic interpretation is
equally permissible (King et al., 2019). It is therefore unresolved
whether these earthquakes occurred on ‘active’ faults (e.g., faults
with evidence of preceding Holocene or Pleistocene surface ruptures;
Clark et al., 2008, 2012; Crone et al., 2003; Machette, 2000; Quigley,
Clark & Sandiford, 2010), whether these faults were newly activated
(e.g., along pre-existing planar structures) or newly created in these
earthquakes (e.g., had no brittle failure prior to historical rupture;
Clark & Edwards, 2018; Machette et al., 1993), or whether these
faults exhibit incipient, emergent rupture behaviours (e.g., fault emer-
gence at the ground surface through upward fault tip migration and
fault propagation folding; Finch et al., 2003; Hardy & Finch, 2007;
Livio et al., 2014, 2019; Tindall & Davis, 1999). Such distinctions bear
directly on questions of how best to characterize seismic hazard in
slowly deforming continental interiors (Allen et al., 2020; Clark, 2018;
Clark et al., 2012; Leonard et al., 2007) and evaluate potential driving
forces responsible for intraplate seismicity (Calais et al., 2005, 2016;
Craig et al., 2016; Liu & Stein, 2016).
In slowly deforming continental interiors, fault recurrence data are
often challenging to obtain because likely recurrence intervals for sur-
face rupturing earthquakes (greater than several 104 to greater than
105 years) may exceed the age of available near-surface sediments
(Clark et al., 2008, 2011, 2012; Crone et al., 1997), and/or may exceed
the temporal range over which earthquake-associated sediments may
be dated by radiocarbon (ca. 0–40 kyr; Ramsey, 2008) and optically
stimulated luminescence (OSL) techniques (commonly less than 70 ka
for U-Th-K (uranium, thorium, potassium) rich sediments in the
Australian context; Clark, Griffin, et al., 2017; Quigley et al., 2006). Fur-
thermore, landscape modification rates associated with erosion and/or
sedimentation processes may exceed fault-slip rates associated with
the maintenance of fault-associated topography (Hornblow et al.,
2014). We attempt to tackle these challenges here by combining envi-
ronmental effects observed in the 2016 MW 6.1 Petermann earthquake
(King et al., 2019) with a multi-methods approach aimed to quantify
landscape evolution rates in the near-fault region. We integrate land-
scape analyses using satellite imagery (e.g., Worldview data) and
beryllium-10 (10Be) cosmogenic nuclide-derived erosion rate estimates
with more typical structural–stratigraphic approaches (trenching) to
expand the confidence of paleoseismic interpretations and the time-
range over which such studies may be undertaken.

Seismotectonic setting
Australia is one of the most seismically active Stable Continental
Regions (SCRs) globally (Braun et al., 2009; Johnston et al., 1994;
Sandiford & Quigley, 2009), with a rich historical record of surface-
rupturing earthquakes (Clark et al., 2020; King et al., 2019). The iden-
tification of more than 360 faults and folds with topographic and/or
geologic evidence for Quaternary earthquake displacement(s) extends
contemporary seismicity over geological timescales (Figure 1; Allen,
Leonard, et al., 2018; Clark, 2012; Clark et al., 2012; Quigley, Clark &
Sandiford, 2010). Investigating earthquake surface rupture hazard is
important in the Australian context for multiple reasons. Firstly, high-
population urban centres (e.g., Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney) and
critical infrastructure (e.g., large dams, energy schemes, transport and
utility
corridors)
are
located
near
known
and/or
suspected
Quaternary-active faults. The seismic risk is unknown for many of
these faults; particularly the faults which are suspected of being active
during the Quaternary. These uncharacterized faults present the larg-
est potential seismic hazard in Australia. Secondly, the current
national probabilistic seismic hazard assessment (NSHA18) (Allen
et al., 2020) and seismic guidelines for large dams (ANCOLD
(Australian National Committee on Large Dams), 2019) rely on
sparsely resolved source-based inputs for faults. Finally, geologic data
provides constraints on, and aids in, the development of new models
to explain intraplate seismicity (Clark et al., 2016; Clark, Griffin, et al.,
2017; Stirling et al., 2011). Within Australia these geological data
require further investigation to prove useful, as they are complicated
by preliminary evidence indicating highly episodic rupture recurrence
behaviours, spatial and temporal earthquake clustering (Clark et al.,
2012; Crone et al., 1997), and surface-rupturing earthquakes on faults

The 2016 Petermann earthquake
The MW 6.1 Petermann earthquake occurred on 20 May 2016 at
03:44 Australian central standard time. It was located in the Protero-
zoic Musgrave Block of central Australia (Edgoose et al., 2004) with

(Geoscience

Figure 1). Additional epicentre locations are published by Global CMT
(Ekström et al., 2012), GEOFON (https://geofon.gfz-potsdam.de/),
Polcari et al. (2018), and Hejrani and Tkalcˇic (2018) (centroid moment
solution). There are no accurate hypocentre depth estimates (the clos-
est seismometer is 166 km west) though a centroid moment tensor
depth was estimated at 1 km (Hejrani & Tkalcˇic, 2018). All published
focal mechanisms indicate an almost pure-reverse faulting event
(Figure 1). Prior notable seismicity within 300 km of the Petermann
epicentre includes two surface-rupturing earthquakes (1986 MW 5.7
Marryat Creek, and 2012 MW 5.18 Pukatja [Ernabella]; Clark et al.,
2014; Machette et al., 1993), the 1989 ML 4.99 Uluru earthquake
(Michael-Leiba et al., 1994), and 2013 MW 5.38 Mulga Park
earthquake (Clark & McPherson, 2013; Figure 1; magnitudes from
Allen, Leonard, et al., 2018)). No earthquakes greater than MW 3.0
have been instrumentally recorded within a 50 km radius of the
epicentre of the Petermann earthquake over the period of the instru-
mental record (see Leonard, 2008).

The Petermann earthquake generated a discontinuous surface rup-
ture extending for a total length of 21 km, as identified from analysis of
interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data and field observa-
tions (Gold et al., 2019; King et al., 2018; Polcari et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2019; Figure 1). The surface rupture trace has an average strike
of 294 ± 29 (Attanayake et al., 2020). The rupture plane dips
between 25
and 35
to the northeast as indicated by focal
mechanisms, modelled by InSAR, and mapped from surface data
(Attanayake et al., 2020; Polcari et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019; this
study). The total length of discrete ground surface ruptures identified
through field studies is 20 km (Gold et al., 2019; King et al., 2019). Mea-
surements of vertical displacement across the discrete ground surface
rupture and broader distributed deformation zone range from less than
0.1 m to greater than 1 m (Attanayake et al., 2020; Gold et al., 2019)

with an average uplift of the hanging-wall of 23 cm relative to the foot-
wall as measured at the surface rupture by a real-time kinematic global
positioning system (RTK GPS) (Attanayake et al., 2020).
Hanging-wall bedrock outcrops within 5 km of the Petermann
surface rupture experienced strong ground motion induced rock falls,
in situ fracturing, and displacement of thin (2–5 cm thick) rock frag-
ments sourced primarily from exfoliation sheets (as visible in most
outcrop images of Figure 2 and described in King et al., 2018). Rock
fall damage on foot-wall outcrops was only observed at less than
2 km distance from the surface rupture, and the intensity of bedrock
fracturing and rock fragment displacements on the foot-wall was
greatly reduced relative to hanging-wall outcrops (King et al., 2018).
The surface rupture trace obliquely intersects a 055 orientated
and southwest-sloping (approximately −0.1%) line of intermittent
drainage overlying a paleochannel (marked by section Y–Y0 on
Figure 3). The surface rupture has caused discrete offset of this paleo-
drainage, increasing gradients in the hanging-wall and reducing gradi-
ents in the foot-wall. Distributed deformation and uplift of the
hanging-wall, as observed in satellite data of Gold et al. (2019) up to
5 km from the surface rupture, has also caused a reduction in gradient
for the distal hanging-wall. This mild topographic perturbation could
theoretically propagate into associated south to southwest flowing
tributaries along the fault and enhance erosion of the hanging-wall by
increasing stream power and concentrating erosion proximal to the

METHODS
2.1
|
Analysis of Worldview-1 imagery and
elevation model
For our topographic analysis we use the pre- and post-Petermann
earthquake digital elevation models (DEMs) produced by Gold et al.
(2019). These were derived using pre-event (March and June 2014)
and post-event (October and November 2016) in-track stereo 0.5 m
resolution panchromatic WorldView-1 and WorldView-2 images
(©2019, DigitalGlobe) using the Surface Extraction from TIN-based
Searchspace Minimization software (Noh & Howat, 2015) running on
the University of Iowa Argon supercomputer. The DEMs are available
at https://doi.org/10.5066/P9353101, and the processing techniques
are described in the supplementary information provided by Gold
et al. (2019), available at https://doi.org/10.1029/2019GL084926.
The data were visualized in the ER Mapper software by applying a
hillshade algorithm simulating the sun shining from the north
(Figure 3). This sunshade azimuth has the effect of highlighting the
topography relating to the scarp and local dune trends, while at the

common to the WorldView-2 sensor. Topographic profiles were con-

Fieldwork and trenching
Fieldwork was conducted along and across the May 2016 Petermann
surface rupture in June 2016 and September 2017 (see King et al.,
2018, for more details). We hand-excavated two trenches across the
surface rupture trace. In 2016 we excavated Trench 1 within the
aforementioned paleo-channel (Figures 1 and 3) to constrain the near-
surface fault dip and characterize structural–stratigraphic relation-
ships. This trench was reopened in September 2017 to obtain an OSL
sample from faulted sediments.
Trench 2 (Figure 1) was excavated in September 2017 3.5 km
southeast of Trench 1 in an interdune sand-plain with shallow and
outcropping crystalline bedrock and calcrete. The base of Trench
1 was hard calcrete (see Section 3.2) and our aim for Trench 2 was to
potentially expose bedrock or the base of the calcrete layer. This may
have helped to identify any faulting preserved in bedrock, or
stratigraphy below and pre-dating the calcrete layer. Trench 2 also
provided confidence to our understanding of near-surface fault
geometry.

Optically stimulated luminescence
OSL samples were collected by driving a stainless-steel tube into
unconsolidated sediments at 0.7 m depth (Figure 4, Table 1) with
additional sediment surrounding the tube collected to determine the
concentration of dose-relevant elements (i.e., U, Th, K) by inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The material extracted
from the inner part of the tubes was prepared for measurement of the
equivalent dose (De) at the University of Melbourne. Sample prepara-
tion
was
conducted
under
red-light
conditions
and
followed
standard procedures (e.g., Wintle, 1997) including separation of the
180–212 μm fraction by wet sieving, elimination of carbonates and
organics using hydrochloric acid (HCl) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
isolation of the quartz fraction using heavy liquid separation, and
etching with 40% hydrogen fluoride (HF) for 45 min followed by HCl
treatment. We apply an infrared-depletion test to check for the
presence of feldspar (Duller, 2003) followed by a single-aliquot regen-
eration (SAR) protocol from Murray and Wintle (2000) to determine
De values for 24 sample aliquots (1 mm) (Table 1). Measurements
were conducted on a Risø TL/OSL DA-20 reader equipped with blue
diodes and Hoya U-340 detection filters using regenerative and test
dose preheats of 180C for 10 s and 180C for 5 s, respectively. After
inspection of De values, paleo-dose calculation was based on the
Central Age Model (CAM, Galbraith et al., 1999). Dose rate and a final
OSL age (Table 1) were calculated using the ADELE software devel-
oped by D. Degering (ADELE dose rates are based on Appendix H in
Aitken, 1985). Cosmic dose rate (Table 1) was calculated using
present-day depth and correcting for geographical position following
the approach in Adamiec and Aitken (1998). Present-day water

Beryllium-10 cosmogenic nuclide erosion
rates
Seven bedrock samples were collected for 10Be cosmogenic nuclide
erosion rate analysis along an 8.5 km long traverse approximately
perpendicular
to
the
2016
surface
rupture
(Figure
2).
Three
additional samples were collected distal to the surface rupture
(19–50 km)
to
provide
proxies
for
background
erosion
rate
(Figure 2). Samples were obtained by hammer and chisel from sub-
horizontal weathered surfaces at the top of bedrock outcrops
(Figure 2). Given the low relief, topographic shielding was minimal
(Supporting
Information
Table
S3).
Sample
thicknesses
were
recorded in the field (Table 2).
Samples A and J were collected to provide estimates of regional
background erosion rates from the top of granite outcrops within the
Mann Ranges (43 km southwest of the surface rupture and 20 m
above sand plain) and Petermann Ranges (20 km northeast of the sur-
face rupture and 50 m above sand plain) (Figure 2). Sample I was col-
lected from a low (5 m above adjacent sand plain) granitic outcrop on
the hanging-wall of the 2016 rupture and the foot-wall of the
Woodroffe Thrust (Figures 1 and 2). The outcrop had fewer exfolia-
tion sheets than all other sampled outcrops and thus appeared
‘fresher’ (i.e., a younger surface). This sample was analysed to poten-
tially provide a maximum erosion rate for the area, given the fresh
appearance of the outcrop. Samples B, C, and H were collected from
large granitic outcrops less than 5 km from the surface rupture on
both the hanging-wall and foot-wall (Figure 2). Samples D, E, F, and G
were collected from low-lying (less than 1 m high) granitic mylonite
outcrops within 500 m of the 2016 Petermann rupture on the
hanging-wall and foot-wall (Figure 2). These samples came from
similar outcrops with similar geomorphic settings (an inter-dune
sand-plain region). Samples D, E, F, B and H, were collected to provide
near-rupture constraints on erosion rates that might record evidence
of paleoseismic activity.
Quartz was extracted from bedrock samples at the University
of Melbourne using standard rock crushing, magnetic and heavy
mineral separation techniques. Separation of Be from quartz grains
was conducted at the University of Melbourne, following the
method described in Quigley et al. (2007). The 10Be/9Be isotopic
abundance ratio of the beryllium oxide samples was measured with
XCAMS, the Accelerator Mass Spectrometry facility at GNS Science
in New Zealand (Zondervan et al., 2015) (details in Table S4).
Beryllium-10 erosion rates (Table 2) were calculated using version
3 of G. Balco’s online erosion rate calculator (last accessed in
December
2019;
https://hess.ess.washington.edu/math/v3/v3_
erosion_in.html) (input data in Table S2). Reported data (Table 2)
follow the recommended protocol of Frankel et al. (2010) and
Dunai and Stuart (2009). Erosion rates reported in Table 2 are
derived based on time-varying production rates modelled by Lifton
et al. (2014) (further details on the erosion rate calculator website).
Other stationary and time-variant model estimates (Lifton et al.,
2008; Stone, 2000) are reported in Table S1. The latter deviate no
more than 5% from the reported rates and are not discussed
further.
Our erosion rate data combined with offset measurements of the
Petermann surface rupture (Attanayake et al., 2020; Gold et al., 2019)
provide an opportunity to quantify the potential time required to
erode a scarp and uplifted topography in this bedrock-dominated
landscape. To do this we make a number of assumptions. Firstly, we
propose that the long-term post-earthquake hanging-wall (scarp) ero-
sion rate may be approximated by the maximum 10Be erosion rate
observed in our sample cohort (Table 2). We acknowledge that past
and future scarp degradation could involve a diversity of erosional
mechanisms (e.g., alluvial and aeolian mechanical weathering, in situ
chemical weathering) in rock and sediment that vary in time and space
and thus acknowledge large epistemic uncertainties are inherent in
this assumption. Secondly, we assume that our average and minimum
10Be erosion rates (Table 2) represent long-term erosion rate
estimates for the foot-wall. And finally, we assume that the
differential erosion rates (ΔE; Figure 5b) obtained from subtracting
the average and minimum rates from the maximum rate provide crude
proxies for the rate at which the hanging-wall re-achieves topographic

equilibrium with the foot-wall (i.e., the fault scarp is denuded to a low
slope feature indistinct from regional topography, and thus is no lon-
ger recognizable as a distinct, linear, stepped topographic anomaly
that could be attributed to ground surface rupture). We use
Equation (1): 1 m – x Myr * (Ermax – Ermin [or avg]) to estimate the resi-
dence of a 1 m high scarp in the landscape (note that offsets of ≈1 m
are only observed in the central 10 km of the scarp; Figure 5b).
Applying our erosion rate results in this way requires assumptions
about how long the surface has been exposed, and that erosion rate
has been constant through time (i.e., steady-state erosion). The
steady-state erosion assumption is often supported through estimat-
ing a timescale for which a calculated erosion rate average is repre-
sentative, in combination with geomorphological evidence. The
sampled surface may be assumed to have been eroding at a constant
rate over a timescale represented by Equation (2): Λ ∕ε, where ε is the
rate of erosion and Λ is attenuation length. This represents the time
required to erode a layer of thickness equal to the attenuation length
and assumes no contradictions from field observations and geomor-
phological arguments (further explored in the Discussion section). The
ratio Λ ∕ε is, to first order, approximated by the ratio between con-
centration N and production rate P of the cosmogenic isotope
(Granger et al., 1996).
Here we aim to constrain the time-range over which those
assumptions, and therefore our erosion rates, are applicable. This time-
range is in practice limited by a combination of external processes
(removal of overlying rock through erosion, attenuation of cosmic-ray
particles by that material, radiometric decay). For the specific case of
this study, the dominant external process is best described by gradual
removal of overlying material. It is unlikely that these samples have
experienced an abrupt change from deep burial to (near-)surface expo-
sure on the timescale of the 10Be half-life (T1/2 ≈1.4 Myr, Nishiizumi
et al.,
2007)

Analysis of pre-Petermann earthquake
Worldview-1 imagery and elevation model
The Petermann Ranges earthquake ground surface rupture transects
topographically subdued landscapes of the central Australian shield
plain (Mabbutt, 1988; Figures 1 and 3) that include isolated granite
and gneiss hills (inselbergs) of the Petermann and Mann Ranges
(e.g., Edgoose et al., 2004; Figure 1) rising above the surrounding flat
to gently undulating Cenozoic erosional surface. Moderately weath-
ered mylonite occurs at or within 4 m of the surface (King et al.,
2018; Figure 1) suggesting the landscape was stripped of weathering
products (i.e., saprolite) before the pre-Quaternary onset of aridity
(e.g., Fujioka & Chappell, 2010). Sediments overlying bedrock are typi-
cally skeletal and related to sheetwash and aeolian processes, except
where Tertiary paleo-valley systems contain several tens of metres of
aeolian, fluvial, lacustrine and chemical sediments (e.g., Bell et al.,
2012). The shield plain is extensively overlain by a field of southeast-
trending mid- to late-Pleistocene longitudinal dunes (Hesse, 2010), up
to several tens of kilometres long and approximately 6 m in height
(Figure 3). Inter-dune spacing is approximately 500 m and dunes can
be greater than several hundred metres in width. Blowout features
are present on the crests of some dunes, but most are currently stabi-
lized by vegetation. The eroded remnants of a presumably older
northeast trending dune set locally form closed depressions with the
southeast trending dune set.
The land surface in the vicinity of the Petermann rupture slopes
gently south to southwest and is characterized by sparse evidence for
channelized drainage. Broad, shallow paleo-channels draining towards
the southwest are truncated by the northwest-trending dune set,
forming strings of playas in interdune regions (Figures 1 and 3).
Paleo-channel margins are locally framed by groundwater carbonate
horizons, which form low escarpments, and in some cases have
resulted in relief inversion (e.g., the ridge beneath the red arrow
immediately south of profile line Z–Z’ in Figure 3a). The paleo-
drainage along which profile Y–Y0 is constructed is illustrative of the
landscape history. This drainage line is framed on the northwest side
by a low escarpment developed in a groundwater carbonate horizon.
The escarpment extends approximately 0.6 km northeast of the scarp
and more than 3.5 km southwest (Figure 3b). This indicates that the
relative base-level fall that triggered the incision leading to exhuma-
tion and exposure of the carbonate layer occurred more than 3.5 km
to the southwest of the 2016 Petermann Ranges earthquake surface
rupture, and so is unrelated to this event or prior events along the
same line.
A comparison of pre- and post-earthquake topographic profiles
from within this paleo-channel (profile Y–Y0), and two shield plain
locations (profiles X–X’ and Z–Z’) supports this observation. Nor is
there evidence in the topography or dune systems to suggest incising
drainage or migrating nick-points across the region of hanging-wall
uplift of the modern rupture. In general, there is no indication of pre-
existing tectonic relief along the line of the 2016 surface rupture (cf.,
Figure 3a,b).

Trench logs
Trench 1 was excavated across the Petermann Ranges earthquake
surface rupture within a playa occupying the axis of the shallow
paleovalley (co-located with profile Y–Y0 in Figure 3). The trench
exposed coarsely layered to un-layered silty fine sand and fine sandy
silt, with a minor to moderate component of medium sand. These clas-
tic sediments are interpreted to reflect a combination of aeolian depo-
sition and sheetwash from the side slopes and down the valley trend,
and lacustrine deposition in the playa in which the trench was exca-
vated. A massive (i.e., homogenous) powdery carbonate horizon is
developed in these materials below 0.72 m depth, presumably as the
result of groundwater flow through the paleovalley sediments
(Krapf & Sheard, 2018; Magee, 2009).
Trench 1 shows a single main fault plane dipping 25, with a
minor splay as the fault reaches the surface. This fault offsets the top
of the calcrete horizon by 0.25 m, consistent with RTK GPS measure-
ments of vertical offset at this location (Attanayake et al., 2020; Gold
et al., 2019). Minor fractures are observed in the hanging-wall sedi-
ments, extending to less than 50 cm depth and not always reaching
the ground surface. Small nodules of calcrete are observed close to
the rupture on the hanging-wall and may have been transported up-
dip along the fault-plane.

Trench 2 was dug within an inter-dune location with bedrock out-
crops on both hanging-wall and foot-wall (location is co-located with
profile X–X’ in Figure 3). Trench 2 also exposed a faulted calcrete hori-
zon developed within aeolian and alluvial sediments. Medium sand is
more abundant and silt less abundant in the clastic sediment profile in
comparison to the profile in Trench 1. This is interpreted to reflect a
primarily sheetwash origin with aeolian input. At 0.25 m depth a nod-
ular pedogenic carbonate is developed with nodules up to 5 cm in
diameter. This calcrete is dissimilar in texture to the massive calcrete
exposed in Trench 1. While both calcretes are presumably related to
groundwater flow, scattered bedrock outcrops in the vicinity of
Trench 2 suggest that the nodular carbonate may be in part
lithogenic.
Trench 2 has one main fault plane dipping 36 with a vertical
offset of 0.4 m (consistent with RTK measurements) and 0.6 m along-
fault (net-slip) measured across the top of the calcrete horizon.
Offsets are measured relative to the calcrete horizon as rupture cau-
sed thickening and over-thrusting of the sediments on the foot-wall.
Minor fractures are visible within the calcrete, with the same dip as
the main fault. However due to the nodular and non-planar top of the
calcrete horizon, it is not clear whether these fractures hosted offset.
Many fractures are visible in the sediment on both hanging-wall and
foot-wall orientated parallel and normal to the main fault. Many of
these fractures do not reach the ground surface.
Vertical offsets measured across calcrete horizons exposed in
both trenches are the same as RTK measurements across rupture at
the surface (Attanayake et al., 2020; Gold et al., 2019), indicating aeo-
lian/alluvium sediment and calcrete only preserve offsets relating to
the 2016 Petermann earthquake.

Optically stimulated luminescence burial age
All 24 measured aliquots exhibited good luminescence characteristics
with bright signals dominated by the fast component (Figure 6a), expo-
nential OSL signal increase as shown by the growth-response curve
(Figure 6b), and all recycling ratios and infrared-depletion ratios consis-
tent with unity (within 2 s). The resulting De distribution does not show
asymmetry and has a low overdispersion of ≈12% (Figure 6c) justifying
the use of the CAM for paleodose and age calculation, and resulting in
a burial age of 10.6 ± 0.4 ka (Table 1). This age is comparable to
existing sedimentary and speleothem records that indicate active
landscapes at this time, characterized by linear dune activity in the
Tirari and Strzelecki deserts (Fitzsimmons et al., 2007), and alluvial
sediment transport around the Flinders Ranges (Gliganic et al., 2014)
under moist climatic conditions (Quigley, Horton, et al., 2010)
dominated by summer rainfall (Singh & Luly, 1991). This age provides a
minimum time interval for any prior ruptures on this fault, as trenching
found no prior offset recorded in the dated sediments (Figure 4).

Cosmogenic nuclide erosion rates
Bedrock erosion rates derived from time-dependent 10Be production
rate model LSDn (Lifton et al., 2014) range from 1.27 ± 0.10 to 2.57 ±
0.20 m Myr−1 with 7–12% relative uncertainties (Table 2, column
LSDn in Table S1). Minimal (less than 1.5%) rate variation is observed
between these rates and those derived using the time-independent
production model based on Stone (2000) and Lal (1991) (column St in
Table S1). Erosion rates calculated with the production model based
on Lifton et al., 2008 (column Lm in Table S1) are consistently 19%
higher than the reported rates. Seven erosion rates (Samples A, D, E,
F, G, H and J) are within 1σ error of each other and fall in the range
1.27–1.71 m
Myr−1.
Likewise,
the
remaining
three
samples
(Samples B, C and I) have overlapping error bars and fall in the range
2.21–2.57 m Myr−1. The unweighted average and standard deviation
of all Samples A–J is 1.75 ± 0.44 m Myr−1.
As a comparison to these results, samples (n = 2) from low-lying
exfoliating granite outcrops in the McDonnell Ranges (Figure 1)
approximately 300 km northeast of this study site, yield erosion rates
(2.2 ± 0.2 and 2.0 ± 0.2 m Myr−1; Heimsath et al., 2010) that are
within error of the average rate established here (Figure 2). Similarly,
exfoliating granite outcrop samples (n = 6) from the Devil’s Marbles
(Figure 1) approximately 650 km northeast of this study site yield an
average erosion rate of 1.6 ± 0.2 m Myr−1 (Bierman & Caffee, 2002;
Portenga & Bierman, 2011).

We cannot identify any correlation between erosion rate and
(i) proximity of the sample to the surface rupture zone, (ii) samples
located on the hanging-wall versus foot-wall, or (iii) samples in the epi-
central area versus far-field regions. We also find no correlation
between erosion rate and height of the sample above the sandplain.
This lack of spatially variable erosion rates is explored in more detail
in the Discussion section (Section 4.3).
Equation (1): 1 m – x Myr * (Ermax – Ermin [or avg]) provides an esti-
mate of how long bedrock offsets related to 1 m coseismic displace-
ment will reside in the landscape, with 0.4–0.6 m of hanging-wall
displacement remaining (relative to the footwall) after 0.5 Myr, and
0.0–0.2 m within 1 Myr (Figure 5b). Application of this approach
suggests the Petermann scarp (with vertical displacements of 0.1 to
1 m) and associated uplifted topography could be erosionally removed
within 0.5–1 Myr (Figure 5b). While this estimate is highly uncertain,
and subject to the assumptions made earlier, it provides a useful
framework for understanding fault scarp residence times in this slowly
eroding landscape. This framework is explored in more detail in the
Discussion section (Section 4.4).
Equation (2) Λ ∕ε provides an approximate value for the timescale
over which our assumptions of steady-state erosion and infinite expo-
sure are applicable (and hence over which our erosion rates might be
reasonably extrapolated). This equation is solved by equating Λ with
the attenuation length of the mechanism that dominates production
near the surface. For
10Be, that mechanism is spallation by fast
neutrons, for which Λ ≈150 g cm−2/2.7 g cm−3 ≈55 cm (Gosse &
Phillips, 2001). Applying Λ ∕ε for our highest (2.57 m Myr−1) and low-
est (1.27 m Myr−1) erosion rates, suggests our calculated erosion rate
average is representative over approximately the last 0.2–0.4 Myr.
Extending our erosion rate results past this time-range (such as in our
0.5–1 Myr estimate for time required to erode the Petermann scarp)
introduces large epistemic uncertainties into our interpretations. This
is explored in more detail in the Discussion section (Section 4.5).

DISCUSSION
4.1
|
Erosion rate variations
We observe a bimodality in our erosion rates with ranges of 1.27 to
1.71 m Myr−1 and 2.21 to 2.57 m Myr−1. This may be attributed to
outcrop scale differences in erodibility (e.g., variable lithology and
fracture density) and/or erosion (e.g., variable exposure to erosive
forces such as wind and water). Alternatively (or additionally), the
cohort of higher erosion rates could relate to different spatial and
temporal scales of episodic erosion (Figure 7) via periodic or stochas-
tic removal of previously overlying rock fragments of unknown thick-
ness, but with a minimum probable thickness less than 30–50 cm in
order to generate the observed variability (Small et al., 1997).
Differences in erosional processes (e.g., wind vs. water) are
unlikely at the scale considered since no relationship between site ele-
vation and erosion rate, nor field evidence for variations in fluvial or
aeolian erosional processes, were found. However, at many sample
sites we identified proximal evidence for in situ exfoliating rock sheets
and eroding boulders greater than 30 to 50 cm thick, as well as
eroded rock debris near sampled outcrops with similar properties
(Figures 2 and 7).
Our favoured hypothesis is that bedrock in the study area erodes
via a combination of (i) exfoliation of thin (thickness less than 5 to
10 cm) sheets that can be approximated by the steady-state erosion
rate assumption (Lal, 1991; Figure 7) and (ii) episodic, and probably
stochastic, erosion of thicker (greater than 30 to 50 cm) overlying rock
fragments (i.e., boulders, Figure 7) that locally increase the apparent
erosion rate (Small et al., 1997). We argue that an unresolved combi-
nation of these processes is responsible for most of the variability in
the 10 erosion rates determined from in situ produced 10Be.

Coseismic erosion during the Petermann
earthquake and implications for cosmogenic 10Be
concentrations
Previous work on Australian faults with Quaternary offsets in the sim-
ilarly arid Flinders Ranges found that bedrock and sediment proximal
to the faults recorded increases in the mean and standard deviation of
10Be erosion rates (Quigley et al., 2007). This work suggested that
earthquake-induced erosion rate perturbations could persist above
background (pre-seismic) rates for greater than 30 kyr within the arid
Australian landscape. This hypothesis suggested multiple processes
could lead to enhanced delivery of material low in 10Be to the sampled
catchments, increasing the apparent erosion rate. These include:
seismically-triggered landslides (e.g., Niemi et al., 2005); seismic
shaking and in situ rock fracturing (e.g., Quigley et al., 2016); and
steepening of stream profiles and catchment flanks via upstream
propagation of earthquake-induced knickpoints (Wobus et al., 2005).
These mechanisms could influence 10Be erosion rates over sustained
(> 103 to 106) timescales, dependent upon conditions including the
nature of the perturbation relative to background erosion rates, lithol-
ogies, topography, vegetation, rates of natural and anthropogenic
surface processes, landscape interactions, and climate-weather vari-
ability. Quigley, Clark and Sandiford (2010) proposed a positive corre-
lation between regional seismic strain rate and average 10Be erosion
rates across the Australian continent. Within this context, it is
valuable to consider whether coseismic erosion induced by the 2016
Petermann earthquake, in this significantly more subdued landscape
relative to those studied elsewhere in Australia, could be expected to
perturb bedrock 10Be concentrations in a manner consistent with that
proposed by Quigley, Horton, et al. (2010) and Quigley, Clark and
Sandiford (2010).
Episodic removal of rock fragments of different thicknesses
affects steady-state erosion rate estimates differently depending on
the rate of erosion. Lines of equal relative uncertainty (i.e., the ratio of
uncertainty to erosion rate) are shown on Figure 5(a) (adapted from
figure 6, Small et al., 1997). These lines vary depending on rock frag-
ment thickness and mean erosion rate (Small et al., 1997). For exam-
ple, for very low erosion rates (e.g., < 1.0 m Myr−1) 10 cm thick rock
removal results in high variability around the sample mean (relative
uncertainty ≈7–20%). For high erosion rates (e.g., > 10 m Myr−1) the
erosion rate recovers quickly from removal of 10 cm and their relative
uncertainty is lower (≈5%).
The thickness range of exfoliated rock sheets/fragments (2–5 cm)
displaced in the Petermann earthquake (King et al., 2018) is plotted
against our 10Be erosion rates (1.27–2.57 m Myr−1
; Table 2) in Box
(i) of Figure 5(a). Box (i) crosses the lines of equally relative uncertainty

from ≈1.5 to 3%. This indicates that the potential range of new
erosion rates following removal of 2 to 5 cm sheet is low, even if
sampling prior to or after an exfoliation event (assuming steady-state
erosion). Box (ii) of Figure 5(a) shows the range of our reported
relative uncertainties (7.5–11.8%; Table 2. Box (iii) of Figure 5(a)
represents the thicknesses of rock fragments (greater than 13 to
15 cm, labelled *(iv) on x axis) that would be required to induce 1σ
variations from steady-state erosion.
Displaced rocks with thicknesses exceeding this 13 to 15 cm
threshold value were only very rarely observed (1 × 10−4% of area of
observed outcrops) on steep bedrock faces (i.e., rockfalls) and never
from flat-lying bedrock surfaces (King et al., 2018). Coseismic rock
fragments displaced from sub-horizontal surfaces in the Petermann
earthquake are thus of insufficient thickness (< 13 cm) to perturb
10Be concentrations in the underlying bedrock, and no 10Be evidence
for coseismic processes on these surfaces will be evident. While iso-
lated occurrences of seismically triggered rockfalls are of sufficient
depth to perturb 10Be concentrations, these outcrops collectively
account for << 0.1% of the total outcrop area in the epicentral region.
The utility of these surfaces to constrain past rupture behaviours on
the Petermann fault via 10Be analysis is therefore limited without
independent evidence (e.g., Quigley et al., 2007).
While the thicknesses of rocks displaced by the Petermann earth-
quake may not produce immediate long-term perturbation of erosion
rates, coseismic uplift and in situ rock fracturing could still influence
10Be concentrations over longer timescales. Coseismic changes in
topography and rock mass strength are likely to significantly perturb
surface processes by locally increasing erosion rates on the uplifted
(and more strongly fractured) hanging wall of the Petermann fault.
This would result in a spatially distinct 10Be cosmogenic signal close

to the surface rupture relative to regional rates, and in hanging-wall
versus foot-wall rates (see next section). We hypothesize that spatially
variable erosion rates resulting from prior ruptures of this fault may
persist over a longer time range than fault-related offsets analogous
to the 2016 event (i.e., < 1 m).

Expected longevity of the Petermann
earthquake scarp and implications for active fault
recognition
The Petermann earthquake fault scarp traverses both bedrock and
sedimentary landscape elements (King et al., 2018). Sheetwash and
channel-related alluvial erosional processes were observed (King et al.,
2018) to erode the scarp more rapidly than adjacent surfaces due to
the enhanced topographic slope at the scarp (Colman & Watson,
1983; McCalpin, 2009). The erodibility and rate of migration of
knickpoints into the uplifted topography may be further enhanced by
coseismic fracturing and fissuring of hanging-wall outcrops (Hsu &
Pelletier, 2004; McCalpin, 2009). Within 1 to 2 weeks of the
Petermann earthquake, large storms removed and/or obscured fine
detail in scarp-related structural features and smoothed scarps in the
unconsolidated surface sediment (King et al., 2018); similar erosional
processes are expected to continue to erode and obscure the fault
scarp. Small displacements at fault scarp tips and displacements in
unconsolidated sediment may thus have short residence times in this
landscape before they are unrecognizable. The length of time in which
a fault scarp is recognizable in the landscape has implications for the
production and completeness of Quaternary-active fault databases
(Clark, 2012) used in seismic hazard analysis, particularly in areas of
low to geodetically unresolvable strain rates. Estimating the landscape
residence time of earthquake scarps may also help to constrain
Mmax and moment rate estimates across similar crustal regions
(e.g., Leonard & Clark, 2011).
Equation (1) suggests the Petermann scarp (with vertical displace-
ments of 0.1 to 1 m) and associated uplifted topography could be
erosionally removed within 0.5–1 Myr (Figure 5b). While this estimate
is highly uncertain, and subject to the assumptions made earlier, it
provides a useful framework for understanding fault scarp residence
times in this slowly eroding landscape.

Rupture history of the Petermann fault
The alluvial and aeolian sediments which overlie the calcrete layer in
Trench 1 are only offset by the 2016 earthquake rupture (Table 1,
Figure 4). The 10.6 ± 0.4 ka OSL age of these sediments indicates that
no prior Holocene ruptures have occurred on the excavated trace of
the Petermann faults. Examination of Worldview-1 data (Figure 3)
revealed no geomorphic or visual evidence for features that could be
interpreted as analogous predecessors of the fault scarp and uplift
zone created in the 2016 Petermann earthquake. Approximately 0.5
to 1 Myr of differential erosion at the minima (footwall) and maxima
(hanging wall) erosion rate estimates would be required to bevel the
contemporary fault scarp and uplifted hanging wall to the pre-
earthquake topography. By inference, any pre-2016 fault-related
topography is likely to have required a similar time period for removal.
The Petermann earthquake therefore appears to be the first surface-
rupturing earthquake on this fault, or any other potential proximal
faults in the epicentral region, in the last 10 ka to 1 Myr or longer.
We note that as the time over which we extrapolate our results
increases, the epistemic uncertainty associated with data limitations
and assumptions increases. It is therefore difficult to speculate on the
pre-0.5 to 1 Ma earthquake history of the Petermann fault. We con-
sider it equally plausible that the 2016 Petermann earthquake was the
first ever ground surface rupturing earthquake on this fault, or that
prior analogous earthquake(s) occurred > 0.5 to 1 Myr ago. The
Petermann fault is favourably orientated for rupture in Australia’s
active intraplate stress-field which has been extant since at least the
late Miocene (i.e., commencement of ‘neotectonic’ deformation at
ca. 5–10 Ma; Hillis et al., 2008; Sandiford et al., 2004) and possibly
much longer (e.g., Eocene; Preiss, 2019). The maximum age interval
over which our inter-seismic period estimate is applicable (1 Ma) thus
allows for the potential of prior earthquakes on the Petermann fault
within the active intraplate stress-field. We are unable to further eval-
uate the potential for a penultimate earthquake(s) on the Petermann
fault with available evidence.
Evidence from a potentially analogous surface-rupturing fault (the
rupture source for the 1986 Marryat Creek earthquake) suggests it
was the first brittle offset of bedrock fabrics since the Precambrian
(Machette et al., 1993). It is possible that the 2016 Petermann earth-
quake was similarly the first ever surface-rupturing earthquake on the
Petermann fault. Further trenching aimed at observing the elevation
of subsurface bedrock on both sides the Petermann fault may con-
strain this hypothesis, though we note that the remote nature of the
event provides significant financial and logistical challenges for such
an endeavour.

Implications for seismic hazard modelling
Conceptually, for the purposes of probabilistic seismic hazard assess-
ment, a fault source is a seismogenic fault that has produced
earthquakes in the past and can be expected to continue doing so
(Musson, 2012). Long-term slip rates are a key component of fault
source input data for seismic hazard modelling (e.g., Allen et al., 2020;
Stirling et al., 2012). While the Petermann fault demonstrably repre-
sents a historical seismic source, the lack of a determinable slip-rate
challenges its inclusion in such models. If moderate to large
earthquakes are assumed to recur on the faults that comprise the
2016 Petermann rupture, the long-term average uplift rate (i.e., the
vertical component of the slip rate) is limited by our very low regional
bedrock erosion rate determinations of 1 to 3 m Myr-1 (Table 2).
This low rate is unlikely to contribute significantly to ground-motion
hazard for return periods that may affect ordinary-use structures
(e.g., 475 or 2475 years) (Allen, Griffin, et al., 2018).

have interseismic periods extending beyond 105 to 106 years (this
study; Clark et al., 2020; King et al., 2019).
In contrast, paleoseismic investigations of pre-historic fault scarps
in the Precambrian SCR of Australia have identified recurrence of

large Quaternary earthquakes that enable the estimation of slip-rates.
These include the Hyden fault (Clark et al., 2008), Lort River fault
(Estrada et al., 2006; Thom, 1971), Dumbleyung fault (Estrada et al.,
2006) and Mount Narryer fault (Whitney et al., 2016; Williams, 1978).
Recurrence has also been demonstrated on faults in the younger
(Phanerozoic) regions of Australia (e.g., Clark et al., 2012; Clark,
McPherson, et al., 2017; Quigley, Clark, & Sandiford, 2010).
In both of these settings there is evidence that large earthquake
occurrence on some faults might be temporally-clustered (e.g., Crone
et al., 1997; Clark, McPherson, et al., 2017).the current lack of defen-
sible mechanism to explain these observations (e.g., Calais et al.,
2016) introduces significant uncertainty when such faults are included
as sources into seismic hazard models (Clark & Edwards, 2018; Clark
et al., 2020).
Seismic hazard models commonly account for the potential for
unmapped active faults, and for ‘one-off’ ruptures, by permitting
moderate-to-large magnitude (i.e., Mw 5.0–7.0) ‘distributed earth-
quakes’ to occur anywhere (e.g., Stirling et al., 2008). These ensemble
models of seismic hazard weight both fault source-based versus dis-
tributed seismicity logic tree branches (Allen, Griffin, et al., 2018,
2020; Clark et al., 2016; Griffin et al., 2018). Multi-methods studies
such as ours are necessary to parameterize fault source models, to
provide an evidencial base for deciding the balance of weighting
between logic tree branches for specific tectonic environments within
low-strain rate regions (e.g., Clark et al., 2020).
Thus while many of the faults discussed in this article are very
remote and represent a low risk to Australia’s spatially concentrated
population, the knowledge gained in studying the behaviour of such
faults contributes directly to the development of more robust and
defensible seismic hazard models, and thereby benefits populated
centres. Moreover, insight gained through studies of Australian surface
rupturing faults and paleoseismic scarps may be applied to analogous
low-strain rate regions globally (e.g., Crone et al., 1997, 2003).

CONCLUSIONS
This article presents a multi-methods approach to quantifying land-
scape evolution rates in the near-fault region of the 2016 MW 6.1
Petermann earthquake to understand the prior rupture history of this
fault and to expand the time-range and confidence over which paleo-
seismic studies may be undertaken. Interpretation of results from
landscape analysis (using pre- and post-earthquake satellite imagery),
OSL dating, and cosmogenic 10Be nuclide erosion rate sampling across
the near- and far-field of the modern rupture area show an absence
of evidence for penultimate rupture. We estimate that the Petermann
scarp and associated hanging-wall uplift could be erosionally removed
in 0.5–1 Myr. This suggests the Petermann earthquake may be the
first surface-rupturing event on this fault in the last 10 ka to 1 Myr or
longer. Extrapolating our assumptions and single nuclide erosion rates
across timeframes > 0.4 Ma introduces large epistemic uncertainties.
We therefore cannot definitively say whether the 2016 event was the
first surface rupturing event on this fault, or that this fault has a >
1 Myr interseismic period. Either option negates the derivation of a
meaningful long-term slip-rate or recurrence model for this fault,
which are key inputs for fault sources in seismic hazard models. We
suggest that the occurrence of future analogous surface-rupturing
earthquakes on unidentified faults may be addressed by including dis-
tributed seismicity components in seismic hazard.
