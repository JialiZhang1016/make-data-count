Abstract
Background: Zucchini fruit set can be limited due to unfavourable environmental conditions in off-seasons crops
that caused ineffective pollination/fertilization. Parthenocarpy, the natural or artificial fruit development without
fertilization, has been recognized as an important trait to avoid this problem, and is related to auxin signalling.
Nevertheless, differences found in transcriptome analysis during early fruit development of zucchini suggest that
other complementary pathways could regulate fruit formation in parthenocarpic cultivars of this species. The
development of next-generation sequencing technologies (NGS) as RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) opens a new
horizon for mapping and quantifying transcriptome to understand the molecular basis of pathways that could
regulate parthenocarpy in this species. The aim of the current study was to analyze fruit transcriptome of two
cultivars of zucchini, a non-parthenocarpic cultivar and a parthenocarpic cultivar, in an attempt to identify key
genes involved in parthenocarpy.
Results: RNA-seq analysis of six libraries (unpollinated, pollinated and auxin treated fruit in a non-parthenocarpic
and parthenocarpic cultivar) was performed mapping to a new version of C. pepo transcriptome, with a mean of
92% success rate of mapping. In the non-parthenocarpic cultivar, 6479 and 2186 genes were differentially expressed
(DEGs) in pollinated fruit and auxin treated fruit, respectively. In the parthenocarpic cultivar, 10,497 in pollinated fruit
and 5718 in auxin treated fruit. A comparison between transcriptome of the unpollinated fruit for each cultivar has
been performed determining that 6120 genes were differentially expressed. Annotation analysis of these DEGs
revealed that cell cycle, regulation of transcription, carbohydrate metabolism and coordination between auxin,
ethylene and gibberellin were enriched biological processes during pollinated and parthenocarpic fruit set.
Conclusion: This analysis revealed the important role of hormones during fruit set, establishing the activating role
of auxins and gibberellins against the inhibitory role of ethylene and different candidate genes that could be useful
as markers for parthenocarpic selection in the current breeding programs of zucchini.

Background
Fruit set is defined as the transition of an ovary to a
growing young fruit, and depends on the successful
completion of pollination and fertilization. Pollination is
the transfer of a pollen grain from the anther to the
stigma. Fertilization occurs in the ovule, and requires
pollen tubes growth in the stylar tissue and fusion with
the egg cell [1]. Both processes are affected negatively by
unfavourable environmental conditions such as low/
high temperature or inadequate humidity that prevents
fruit set in the majority of flowering plants [2].
In the case of zucchini, one of the most important
morphotypes of Cucurbita pepo, these harsh conditions
especially occur in off-season crops, causing economic
losses due to low fruit yield. Parthenocarpy, fruit devel-
opment in the absence of pollination/fertilization, has
been recognized as an important trait to avoid this prob-
lem in different fruit crops [3], considering than each
species shows specific responses following pollination/
fertilization, In Cucurbita, the most practical mean of

increasing
fruit
set
of
zucchini
when
pollination/
fertilization is inadequate would be the use of cultivars
with vegetative parthenocarpy, innate ability to set par-
thenocarpic fruit [4], but this kind of parthenocarpy is
limited to a few cultivars in C. pepo. For several cultivars
of zucchini, we provided previously an exhaustive de-
scription of the specific changes in fruit set observed
after successful pollination or parthenocarpy, when com-
pared with non-pollination [5].
Parthenocarpy has been related to certain plant hor-
mones as auxins, gibberellins, cytokinin and brassinos-
teroids
[6].
Exogenous
application
of
these
plant
hormones induces parthenocarpy fruit set in cucumber
and zucchini [4], and high levels of endogenous IAA
were found in parthenocarpic fruit respect to pollinated
fruit in cucumber [7]. Furthermore, natural partheno-
carpic tomato mutants pat and pat-2 accumulate high
levels of gibberellin in the unpollinated ovaries [8].
Transcriptome analyses have led to the successful
identification of some genes associated with partheno-
carpy. Over-expression of SlGA20ox1 was found at high
levels throughout fruit growth in the pat mutant in to-
mato [8]. Over expression of SlTIR1 (an auxin receptor)
give rise to parthenocarpic fruit set in cucumber treated
with exogenous auxins [9]. Down-regulated expression
of SlARF7 (Auxin Response Factor 7) and SlIAA9 (Aux/
IAA gene) also induced parthenocarpy in transgenic to-
matoes [10, 11]. On the other hand, mutations in ARF8
and IAA9 induced parthenocarpy in Arabidopsis and to-
mato respectively [12, 13]. These genes, ARF8, IAA9 and
TIR1, showed downregulation during fruit set in polli-
nated fruit of non-parthenocarpic cultivars of C. pepo.
Nevertheless, differences found in transcriptome analysis
suggest that other complementary pathways could regu-
late fruit formation in parthenocarpic cultivars of this
species [5]. Consequently, more knowledge about tran-
scriptome responses of fruit set is required to exploit
parthenocarpy in zucchini.
The reference transcriptome of Cucurbita pepo L. ssp.
pepo is a valuable resource for identification of tran-
scripts involved in specific biological processes, improv-
ing
genome
annotation,
elucidating
phylogenetic
relationships, providing SSR and SNP markers and
large-scale expression analysis [14]. Large-scale expres-
sion analysis, as microarray gene chip experiments,
could be a powerful tool for monitoring the expression
level of thousands of genes involved in fruit set and par-
thenocarpy in zucchini, but detecting transcripts by
microarray technology is limited to genomic sequencing.
Moreover, it is a laborious and capital intensive task, and
the statistical reproducibility of the data is relatively
poor. Nowadays, the development of next-generation se-
quencing technologies as RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq)
opens a new horizon for mapping and quantifying
transcriptome, creating opportunities to better under-
stand
the molecular basis of pathways that could
regulate these processes. These methods improved se-
quencing capabilities with respect to amount of data,
time, and cost, and do not depend on prior gene identifi-
cation or assembly onto microarrays [15, 16]. RNA-seq
technology has been used to improve the genome anno-
tations, to detect areas of alternative splicing to discover
new genes and novel transcribed regions and to perform
differential expression analysis. This method has many
advantages such as lower background signal, higher suit-
ability for both known transcripts and new genes, and
ability to quantify a large dynamic range of expression
levels, with absolute rather than relative values, even
with species that lacked a reference genome [17].
RNA-seq has been used for analyzing the transcriptome
responses to fruit set and parthenocarpy in cucumber.
[18]. However this type of technology has not been yet
applied for studying these processes in zucchini.
In the current study, differences in fruit transcriptome
of two cultivars of zucchini, a non-parthenocarpic culti-
var and a parthenocarpic cultivar has been analysed
through RNA-seq in an attempt to identify genes that
play important roles during pollination, fruit set and
parthenocarpy.
Results
Analysis of RNA-seq libraries
Two cultivars of Cucurbita pepo spp. pepo morphotype
zucchini were used in this study, a non-parthenocarpic
cultivar MUCU-16(Acronym MU16), and a partheno-
carpic cultivar Whitaker (Acronym WHT). Samples of
pollinated fruit (PF), non-pollinated fruit (UF) and auxin
treated fruit (AF) of both cultivars were obtained to con-
struct 6 libraries to be sequenced for RNA Seq analysis.
Raw data was generated through Illumina HiSeq 2500
sequencing and was subjected to initial treatment, low
quality
regions
and
adapter
sequences
have
been
trimmed. Samples ranged from 42.4 to 84.8 million
reads with mean read length of 101 pb, which is enough
for the quantitative analysis of gene expression (Table 1).
The reference transcriptome of C. pepo v3 consists of
108,062 transcripts that represent 73,239 unigenes clus-
ters with an average length of 1052 pb. RNA-seq reads
obtained from six libraries were mapped to the reference
transcriptome of C. pepo v3, with a mean of 87% success
rate of mapping, but high percentage of multiple reads
(36%) were obtained (Table 1).
Therefore, CD-hit program [19] was used to analyse
the redundancy of the reference transcriptome and se-
quences with 85% of homology were clustered. The lon-
gest unigene was chosen to represent each cluster,
resulting in a total of 73,239 unigenes with an average
length of 818 pb. Sequencing reads were newly mapped

to the processed transcriptome, obtaining higher rate of
unique mapped reads and lower number of multiple
mapped reads, with a mean of 92% success rate of map-
ping (Table 1). This improved RNA-seq using the proc-
essed transcriptome was used for subsequent analysis.
Differentially expressed genes during fruit set
RNA-seq
mapping
revealed
the
number
of
genes
expressed in each sample (Fig. 1). Comparison between
pollinated, auxin and unpollinated fruit treatments in
both cultivars showed that 52,240 and 54,761 genes were
expressed in common in MUCU-16 and Whitaker re-
spectively independently of treatment applied. Genes
with differential expression during fruit set were filtered
using the transcriptome of unpollinated fruit for both
cultivars. A FDR of 0.05 and an absolute value of fold
change ≥2 were used as the threshold to judge the sig-
nificance
of
the
differential
gene
expression(Addi-
tional file 1) In the non-parthenocarpic cultivar, 6479
and 2186 genes were differentially expressed in polli-
nated fruit (PF MU16 vs UF MU16) and auxin treated
fruit (AF MU16 vs UF MU16) respectively. In the par-
thenocarpic cultivar, 10,497 genes were differentially
expressed in pollinated fruit (PF WHT vs UF WHT) and
5718 genes in auxin treated fruit (AF WHT vs UF
WHT). A comparison between transcriptome of the
unpollinated fruit for each cultivar has been performed
(UF WHT vs UF MU16), determining that 6120 genes
were differentially expressed. It was also found that pol-
lination treatment generated the highest number of
expressed genes and the highest number of differentially
expressed genes (Fig. 1).
Previous C. pepo gene annotation was incomplete be-
cause about 50% of DEGs had previous annotation in C.
pepo transcriptome v3. Structural and functional annota-
tion of DEGs was performed by BLAST analysis (e-value
of 1e-25) with public databases. DEGs were compared to
Arabidopsis genome and Arabidopsis proteins from TAIR,
Nucleotide collection nr from NCBI, Swiss-Prot database,
Cucurbita maxima genome and Cucurbita pepo genome
v4 (Additional file 2). About 30% of DEGs had one signifi-
cant hit with Arabidopsis genome and more than 40% of
DEGs blasted with Arabidopsis proteins, improving the
previous annotation with this species (Table 2). Blast ana-
lysis revealed that 55% of unigenes had significant matches
in Nucleotide collection nr database, where the most of
hits found were with Cucumis melo and Cucumis sativus
gene. Sequence homology was also performed with the ac-
curate database Swiss-Prot, obtaining more than 30% had
significant matches (Table 2). This new blast analysis

plant specific GO slims (level 2) within the biological
process, molecular function and cellular component cat-
egories were carried out. Metabolic process and cellular
process were the most highly represented groups in bio-
logical process (Table 3). Genes involved in other import-
ant biological processes such as response to stimulus were
also identified in pollination in the non-parthenocarpic
cultivar and single-organism process in parthenocarpic
cultivar. Under molecular function category, assignments
were to the binding and catalytic activities (Table 3). It is
worth noting that GO annotations revealed high number
of transferases, kinases and hydrolases in this category,
suggesting that genes involved in the secondary metabolite
synthesis pathways were induced during fruit set (Add-
itional file 3). In the case of cellular component, GO terms
related to cell, membrane and organelle were well-repre-
sented (Table 3) DEGs also were annotated using KEGG
pathway database (Additional file 3).
DEGs between pollination and auxin treatment in both
cultivars were compared. Cluster analysis was used to
screen the common expressed genes between them. A
total of 1570 and 4522 were induced in both treatments

in MUCU-16 and Whitaker, respectively (Fig. 2a). Of
these subsets of DEGs, 1007 genes were common in
both cultivars, which represented 64% of common DEGs
in MUCU-16 cultivar and 22% in Whitaker cultivar. To
further understand the function of these DEGs, GO en-
richment analysis in the category of biological process
was performed (p < 0.05). DEGs involved in cell cycle,
DNA replications, microtubule movement, regulation of
transcription
or
biosynthetic
process
were
highly
enriched (Fig. 2b).
It was also compared pollination treatment between
both cultivars. 3939 DEGs were induced during pollin-
ation fruit set in both cultivars (Fig. 3a). GO enrichment
analysis revealed that DNA replication, microtubule
movement, regulation of biosynthetic process, regulation
of biological process, cell proliferation, auxin-activated
signalling pathway and cellular response to auxin stimu-
lus were enriched processes in the category of biological
process (Fig. 3b). On the other hand, 1213 DEGs were
induced during auxin treated fruit set in both cultivars
(Fig. 3a). GO enrichment analysis showed differences in
biological processes activated during auxin treatment in
comparison to pollination (Fig. 3). Microtubule move-
ment, regulation of biosynthetic process and regulation
of biological process were also induced, but processes
related to auxins were not enriched in this treatment
(Fig. 3c).
Expression of genes associated with cell division during
fruit set
Cell division related genes were analysed based on previ-
ous DEGs results, cyclins and expansins (EXPs) were fil-
tered.
During pollination, 18 and 32 cyclins
were
induced in MUCU-16 and Whitaker, respectively. Of
those cyclins, 16 DEGs were expressed in common in
both cultivars, showing the same regulation. It was

type D, 2 cyclins of type P, CSK1 and CDKB2 genes. All
cyclins
were up-regulated during pollination, except
CYCP2–1.Pollination also induced differential expression
of expansins, and the majority of these genes were
up-regulated. 4 expansins were expressed in common dur-
ing pollinated fruit set in both cultivars, EXPA1, EXPA8,
EXPA4 were upregulated and EXPLB1 was strongly down-
regulated (Additional file 4). During auxin treatment, 2
cyclins were found in the non-parthenocarpic cultivar.
These cyclins were also induced in pollination treatment
in this cultivar. In the case of the parthenocarpic cultivar,
24 cyclins were differentially expressed, activating also
cyclins of type A, B, D and P. All of these cyclins were also
induced during pollination in this cultivar, but its fold
change was lower in auxin treatment. In the case of
expansins, EXPLB1 was also strongly downregulated in
both cultivars and higher number of expansins were

EXPLA1showed the same regulation and pollination/auxin
treatment fruit set and during parthenocarpic fruit set (UF
WHT vs UF MU16) (Additional file 4).
Identification of transcription factors related to fruit set
RNA-seq data showed that 207 and 254 transcription
factors (TFs) displayed differential expression during
pollination in MUCU-16 and Whitaker, respectively. In
the case of auxin treatment, 124 and 220 were induced,
a lower number in comparison to pollination treatment
(Additional file 5). TFs were classified into several fam-
ilies including NAC, ERFs (Ethylene-responsive tran-
scription factor), WRKY, bHLH (Basic helix-loop-helix
protein),
MYB,
HD-Zip
(Homeobox-leucine
zipper
protein) and MADS-box, among which NAC, AP2/
ERF and WRKY recruited the major members. The
vast majority of them were downregulated after pol-
lination and auxin treatment (Fig. 4, Additional file 5).
In the case of UF WHT vs UF MU16, 158 TFs were
differentially expressed. Expression of these genes was
different in comparison to pollination and auxin treat-
ment (Additional file 5).
MADS-box and HD-Zip families were reviewed in de-
tail. MADS-box family proteins, including Agamous-like
MADS box proteins (AGL), represented lower rate in
comparison to NAC, AP2/ERF and WRKY families dur-
ing fruit set (Fig. 4). DEGs analysis revealed differential
expression of 6 MADS-box genes during pollinated fruit
set, CMB1
(also
called
AGL3),
SOC1
(also
called
AGL20), AGL8, AGL11, AGL16 and AGL18 in the par-
thenocarpic variety. CMB1, SOC1, SVP, FBP24, AGL12
and AGL16 were expressed in the non-parthenocarpic
variety. CMB1, SOC1 and AGL16 were commonly
downregulated during pollinated fruit set in both culti-
vars. During fruit set dependent of auxin treatment,
AGL8, AGL16 and FBP24 were strongly downregulated
in MUCU-16 cultivar. Downregulation was also ob-
served in AGL19 and SOC1 in Whitaker cultivar (Add-
itional file 5).
On the other hand, HD-zip family represented greater
rate than MADS-box family (Fig. 4). The overwhelming
majority of HD-zip genes were down-regulated in pollin-
ation and auxin treatment. HAT5, HOX11, HOX20,
ATHB7, ATHB12, ATBH21 and ATHB40 were expressed
in common in both cultivars during pollination and

auxin treatment. Stronger downregulation was observed
in ATHB7 and ATBH21, more than 20 fold of expression
(Additional file 5).
Comparison of the carbohydrate-related responses during
fruit set
Carbohydrate metabolism was strongly induced during
fruit set in zucchini (Additional file 6). During pollinated
fruit set, 45 genes were expressed in common in both
cultivars, 17 genes were up-regulated and 28 genes were
down-regulated. Over-expression was found in key en-
zymes involved in glycolisis as enolase1, glyceraldehyde-
3-phosphate dehydrogenase and fructose-bisphosphate
aldolase, and genes related to starch accumulation as
phosphoglucan phosphatase amyloplastic, and starch
biosynthesis as 1,4-alpha-glucan-branching enzyme. On
the other hand, negative regulation was found in gluco-
nokinase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, sucrose
synthase,
amylases
and
alpha-trehalose-phosphate
synthases (Additional file 6). High levels of glucose and
fructose found during pollinated fruit set in both culti-
vars and low levels of sucrose are produced by activation
of glycolisis via glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogen-
ase and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase and downregula-
tion of sucrose synthase (Fig. 5). In addition, it was also
found low levels of starch in spite of activation of en-
zymes related to starch biosinthesis (Fig. 5, Additional
file 6). During auxin treatment, 26 DEGs were expressed
in common in both cultivars. Of this subset of genes,
1,4-alpha-glucan-branching enzyme and polygalacturase
were up-regulated in common in both cultivars in con-
trast to amylases and threalose phosphate synthases,
which were down-regulated. A detailed analysis of auxin
treatment in each cultivar was carried out. In MUCU-16,
fructose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase was up-regu-
lated. On the other hand, pyruvate kinase and phospho-
enolpyruvate
carboxykinase
1
were
up-regulated
in
Whitaker (Additional file 6). Over-expression of these en-
zymes corroborated high levels of glucose and fructose
found during auxin treated fruit set in both cultivars
(Fig. 5). Nevertheless, during parthenocarpic fruit set,
glucose and fructose levels were similar to unpollinated
fruit of MUCU-16 (Fig. 5). This is contrary to over-expres-
sion
of
fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase,
pyruvate
kinase,
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, sucrose syn-
thase and 6-phosphofructokinase 5, that indicated the
carbohydrate biosynthesis (Additional file 6).
Hormone metabolism and signalling during fruit set
Hormone related genes were filtered based on previous
DEGs results, 225 and 255 DEGs related to hormone
were screened in pollinated fruit in MUCU-16 and Whi-
taker, respectively. However, lower number of DEGs, 99
and 210, was expressed during auxin treatment. These
screened genes were involved in biosynthesis and signal-
ling of auxins, ethylene, gibberellins, abscisic acid, cyto-
kinin,
brassinosteroids,
jasmonic
and
salicylic
acid
(Additional file 7). Percentages of DEGs related to these

up-regulated genes in comparison with ethylene, gib-
berellins and abscisic acid (Fig. 6).
Cluster analysis was carried out to elucidate the regula-
tion of common hormone-related genes during fruit set. Of
the subsets of DEGs related to hormone analysed previ-
ously, 64 genes were common during pollination and auxin
treatment in both cultivars. Regulation of gene expression
was similar during pollination in both cultivars and during
auxin treatment in both cultivars (Fig. 7). Most of these
common genes were related to auxin (24 genes, 37.5%) and
ethylene (25 genes, 39%). Auxin genes were involved in
auxin signalling (Aux/IAA and WTR families), auxin polar
transport (PIN Auxin efflux carriers), response to auxin
(SAUR Auxin responsive proteins) and auxin homeostasis
(indole-3-acetic acid-amido synthetase, GH3.1, and indole-
3-acetate o-methyltransferase 1, IAMT1). Expression of
IAA genes, IAA4, IAA14 and IAA16 clustered together with
PIN6, WAT1 and SAUR50, showing over-expression. How-
ever, GH3.1, an auxin biosynthesis gene, and others mem-
bers of SAUR family (SAUR32) and PIN family (PIN5)
decreased their expression under pollination and auxin
treatment. Remarkably, IAA19, AUX22 and WAT1 showed
the strongest up-regulation during fruit set. On the other
hand, DEG analysis showed a decrease in mRNA levels of
ethylene related genes. Ethylene biosynthesis genes (ACC
oxidases, ACO1 and ACO3) and ethylene signalling genes,
including ERFs (12 ERFs), EIN3 (Ethylene insensitive 3) or
ETR2 (Ethylene receptor 2) among others, displayed
down-regulation during fruit set. Apart from these findings

with GAs biosynthesis and signalling has been also modu-
lated during fruit set. Expression of GA20ox1 (Gibberellin
20 oxidase 1) was found to be strongly up-regulated in con-
trast to expression of GA2ox2 (Gibberellin 2-beta-dioxy-
genase 2) and GID1B (Gibberellin receptor). To a lesser
extent, genes related to cytokinin (Cytokinin riboside
5′-monophosphate phosphoribohydrolases, LOG1 and
LOG5, and Cytokinin synthase IPT5), abscisic acid
(9-cis-epoxycarotenoid
dioxygenases,
NCED1
and
NCDE3, and abscisic acid receptor PYL8), brassinos-
teroids (Cytochrome P450 90A1, CYP90A1) and sali-
cylic acid (Salicylic acid-binding protein 2, SABP2)
were differentially expressed in common. All genes
were downregulated, except CYP90A1. CYP90A1, a
BRs biosynthesis gene, was up-regulated and clustered
together auxin genes (Fig. 7).
Auxin at the transcriptome level during zucchini fruit set
Genes related to auxin have been filtered during pollin-
ation and during auxin treatment in both cultivars, indi-
cating that DEGs related to auxin biosynthesis, auxin
metabolism and signalling were strongly induced during
fruit set (Fig. 6, Fig. 7 and Additional file 7).
During pollinated fruit set, auxin biosynthesis genes
were altered. YUCCA6 (indole-3-pyruvate monooxygen-
ase) and IAMT1 were up-regulated and three genes of
GH3 family, GH3.1, GH3.5 and GH3.6, were downregu-
lated. Related to auxin signalling, ten Aux/IAAs were
expressed differently, being only IAA26 and IAA18
down-regulated in both cultivars. Contrasting with Aux/
IAA family, ARFs showed different regulation between
cultivars, ARF5 and ARF16 were down-regulated in
MUCU-16 cultivar, and ARF5, ARF7 and ARF18 were
up-regulated in Whitaker cultivar. Over-expression was
also found in auxin efflux carriers, PIN1A, PIN1B, PIN6,
PIN8, and auxin influx carriers, AUX1, LAX2 and LAX4
(Additional file 7).
During auxin treatment, auxin biosynthesis genes
were
also
differentially
expressed,
YUCCA8
was
downregulated
in
MUCU-16,
and
YUCCA7
and
IAMT1 was up-regulated in Whitaker. IAA and ARF
genes were also modulated during auxin treatment
and, most of them showed the same regulation than
during pollinated fruit set. IAA4, IAA14, IAA16 and
IAA19 were also up-regulated during auxin treated
fruit set in both cultivars, but ARF5 and ARF18 were
only up-regulated in Whitaker cultivar. Auxin treat-
ment also produced changes in PIN proteins and
AUX/LAX proteins. PIN1, PIN1D and PIN6 were
over-expressed together two AUX/LAX transporters,
indicating that efflux and influx of auxins also oc-
curred in auxin treatment. In the case of partheno-
carpic fruit set (UF WHT vs UF MU16 comparison),
it was found DEGs related to auxin with similar ex-
pression to pollination or auxin treatment. ARF18,
PIN1B, PIN8 and LAX1 were also upregulated as pol-
lination/auxin treatment (Additional file 7).
Biosynthesis and signalling of ethylene and gibberellin
during fruit set
Ethylene metabolism is one of the most represented hor-
mones during pollinated fruit set. RNA-Seq data re-
vealed a decrease in the mRNA levels of most of
ethylene related gene (Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Additional file 7).
ACO1 and ACO3, which catalyze the subsequent steps
of ethylene biosynthesis via S-adenosyl-L-methionine,
were strongly downregulated during pollinated fruit set
in contrast to auxin biosynthesis genes. As occurred for
ACO genes, ethylene signalling genes including ERFs,
ETR2 and EIN3s appeared down-regulated during polli-
nated fruit set. Higher number of DEGs related to ethyl-
ene was also altered during auxin treatment, and their
regulation was similar to found during pollinated fruit
set (Fig. 7, Additional file 7).
During parthenocarpic fruit set, ACO1, ETR2 and five
ERFs (ERF2, ERF11, ERF12, ERF17 and ERF60) were
downregulated as pollination/ auxin treatment in both
cultivars. Moreover, WIN1 were upregulated as pollin-
ation treatment in Whitaker cultivar (Additional file 7).
A subset of genes associated with GAs biosynthesis
and signalling has also been modulated during pollinated
fruit set (Table 4). Three GID1-like genes, that encode
GA receptors, showed down-regulation in response to
pollination as well as GID2, an F-box protein that is es-
sential for GA-mediated DELLA protein degradation.
GA2ox1 and GA2ox8, which play important role in gib-
berellins catabolism, displayed a decrease of gene ex-
pression. However, GA3OX4, involved in production of
GA bioactive for reproductive development, and GASA4,
gibberellin-regulated protein, was up-regulated during
pollination. Remarkably, genes related to gibberellin bio-
synthesis, KAO1 (Ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase 1) and
KAO2 (Ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase 2), which catalyze
three successive oxidations of ent-kaurenoic acid giving
gibberellin 12 (GA12), and GA20ox1 and GA20ox2, key
enzymes of gibberellin biosynthesis that catalyzes the
conversion of GA12 and GA53 to GA9 and GA20 re-
spectively, were up-regulated during pollinated fruit set
in zucchini. Five of these genes were also common be-
tween cultivars during auxin treatment (Table 4). In the
case of parthenocarpic fruit set, 15 genes related to gib-
berellin were differentially expressed (Additional file 7).
Of this subset of genes, four genes showed the same
regulation as pollinated/ auxin treated fruit set. GA20ox1
and GASA4 were up-regulated in contrast to GA2ox8
and GID1B (Table 4).

Discussion
A modification in C. pepo transcriptome allows more
specific mapping during gene expression analysis in
RNA-seq
RNA-seq is a high-throughput sequencing assay that
combines transcript identification and quantification of
gene expression, core activities to study many processes
in the plant life cycle as fruit set. Two strategies are pos-
sible to read mapping and transcript identification when
a reference sequence is available, genome mapping or
transcriptome mapping [17]. In the case of this assay,
mapping was carried out against a reference transcrip-
tome since the new version of C. pepo genome (https://
bioinf.comav.upv.es/downloads/zucchini/) lacked of gene
annotation [20].
In order to reduce the high percentage of multiple
mapped reads and unmapped reads that could limit gene
identification (Table 1), transcriptome sequenced from root,
leaf and flower tissue was modified. This processed tran-
scriptome improved mapping statistics of RNA-seq librar-
ies. Total mapped reads were higher (Table 1) and similar
to RNA-seq analysis using the last version of genome [20].
Previous gene annotation of the reference C. pepo
transcriptome was also improved by a new blast analysis
of DEGs with a more restrictive e-value (cut off e-value
of 1e-25) carried out in this work, increasing the num-
bers of genes with functional annotation in the proc-
essed C. pepo transcriptome (Table 2, Additional file 2).
In spite of this deeply blast analysis, there are still a
number of non-annotated transcripts in C. pepo tran-
scriptome (Additional file 2). These transcripts without
annotation may be consequence to the short sequences
generated by the 454 sequencing technology used to as-
sembly the first transcriptome of C. pepo [14]. Probably,
these sequences lack the conserved functional domains
or may be no-codings RNAs (Additional file 2).
Cluster analysis of DEGs elucidated differences between
pollinated fruit set and auxin treated fruit set
Comparative analysis of gene expressed showed a high
number of common expressed genes between pollinated,
auxin treated and unpollinated fruit in zucchini, indicating
that there are common pathways between treatments
(Fig. 1). Thus, it was necessary to carry out DEG analysis
to find key role genes induced by pollination and/or auxin
treatment during fruit set [17]. DEGs analysis revealed
that pollination induced the highest number of DEGs and
the highest values of fold change (Fig. 1, Additional file 1),
although 1007 DEGs were expressed in common during
pollination and auxin treatment (Fig. 2), which revealed
that rapid activation of fruit metabolism is mediated by
cell cycle, regulation of transcription, regulation of biosyn-
thetic process or DNA replication (Fig. 2). However, DEGs
cluster analysis and GO enrichment analysis revealed dif-
ferences between pollinated fruit set and auxin treated
fruit set. Pollination activated processes related to
auxins as auxin-activated signalling pathway and cel-
lular response to auxin stimulus, not found during
auxin treated fruit set. On the other hand, auxin
treatment activated many more processes related to
cell division, not enriched during pollinated fruit set
(Fig. 3). This corroborates the hypothesis that the

addition of synthetic hormones does not initiate the
same processes as natural pollination [11, 21].
Cell division is an enriched biological process during fruit
set
During early fruit development in zucchini, fruit length
and placental diameter grow rapidly suggesting that cell
division is increased [5]. Moreover, it was found that
functional categories of DEGs by GO term enrichment
analysis showed that cell cycle, cell cycle progress, mi-
totic cell cycle and mitotic cell cycle progress related
genes were strongly induced (Fig. 2). Differential expres-
sion observed in cyclins, CDKs (cyclin dependent kinase
enzymes) and cell wall genes during zucchini fruit set
positively correlated with rapid cell division observed in
zucchini, and also observed during early fruit develop-
ment of tomato and cucumber [22, 23].
Cyclins are the most important cell cycle regulators
and control the progression of cells through the cell
cycle by activating CDKs [24]. D-type cyclins (CYCDs)
that regulate the G1–S transition and G2-M transition
[25]. A-type cyclins (CYCAs), that are mainly present
from S phase to M phase, and B-type cyclins (CYCBs),
that take part the G2–M transition and during M phase
[26], were differentially expressed, evidencing a cell cycle
progression during fruit set which induce the exponen-
tial growth phase observed previously [5]. Of these sub-
families of cyclins, cyclin D proteins are often noted as
sensors of environment, linking hormonal signal with
external
conditions,
and
reporting
to
cell
on
the
favourable conditions for cell-cycle start [27]. D-type
cyclins
as
CYCD3;1, CYCD3;2 and
CYCD5;1 were
over-expressed during zucchini fruit set, (Additional
file 4), and similar regulation had already been previ-
ously described in cucumber fruit [23] which would in-
dicate their fundamental role in fruit set process. It is
particularly important to point out that CYCD3;1 was
reported to be a rate-limiting factor for G1 /S transition
[25] and its expression is regulated by hormones signal-
ling and the availability of nutrients as sugars Previous
results reported that CYCD3;1 activated cell division at
the G1-S cell cycle phase transition in response to cyto-
kinin and auxin in Arabidopsis [28]. Over-expression of
this gene found in zucchini fruit could be related to
over-expression of auxin and cytokinin biosynthesis and
signalling genes also found (Fig. 7). Moreover, CYCD6;1,
a cyclin involved G1-S cell cycle phase transition, were
over-expressed during pollinated/auxin treatment and
parthenocarpic fruit set (Additional file 4), indicating
that its over expression is closely linked to partheno-
carpy in zucchini. Together cyclins, CDKs regulate cell
cycle through the association of these proteins to two
key classes of regulatory molecules, CKS1 and CKS2
(Cyclin-dependent kinases regulatory subunits) [25]. In
the
case
of
zucchini,
CKS1
and
CDKB2;2
were
over-expressed with similar fold change during fruit set
(Additional file 4),. These proteins have shown inter-
action between them in Arabidopsis, and this interaction
may also occur in zucchini, regulating cell cycle [29].
Cell cycle progression gives rise to the formation of two
daughter cells. Prior to this process, cell undergoes a rapid
enlargement (cell expansion) that involves the wall loosen-
ing. Expansins have been recognized as the major
wall-loosening agents and cause extension of plant cell
walls
by
disrupting
non-covalent
binding
between
cellulose and hemicelluloses [30]. DEG analysis revealed
expasins of the four subfamilies identified in plants,
A-expansins (EXPAs), B-expansins (EXPBs), expansin-like
A (EXLA) and expansin-like B (EXLB) during zucchini
fruit set (Additional file 4). Previous studies showed that
expansins were also highly enriched in growing cucumber
fruits with similar differential expression to found in zuc-
chini fruits, EXPA1 and EXPA8 were up-regulated in con-
trast to the strongly downregulation showed by EXPLB1
[23]. Interestingly, expansins are thought to linked cell en-
largement and cell wall changes with auxin signalling [25].
Over-expression of EXPA1 and EXPA8 found in zucchini
fruit might be induced by auxin signalling in Arabi-
dopsis
[31].
The
relation
between
expression
of
expansins and auxin signalling in zucchini could be
underline by downregulation of ARF7 during polli-
nated fruit set (Additional file 7). Arabidopsis mutants
in ARF7 (loss of function mutant) showed less ex-
pression level of EXPA1 and EXPA8 [31].
Down-regulation of MADS-box and HD-ZIP transcription
factors play key roles in zucchini fruit set
Gene expression at the level of transcription is mediated
by transcription factors and is crucial for almost all bio-
logical processes, including fruit development. Different
TFs were differentially expressed during fruit set, being
NAC, ERF/AP2, WRKY and bhLH the most representa-
tive families (Fig. 4), similar to found during siliques de-
velopment in Arabidopsis and fruit tomato [22, 32]. This
indicates that rate between the different families of TFs
could affect fruit development in zucchini.
A further focus was made on the MADS-box and
HD-ZIP families, which play key roles in fruit, set, via
down-regulating their transcription in tomato and Ara-
bidopsis, and contain many members that are function-
ally well-characterized during fruit development [22, 32].
TF genes in this group are AGAMOUS like genes,
MADS-box genes whose expression diminished in devel-
oping ovules when the integuments appear in Arabidop-
sis [32]. In the case of zucchini, when the fruit is
pollinated in both cultivars, three AGAMOUS like genes
were downregulated, AGL16, SOC1 (AGL20), CMB1
(AGL3), indicating the development of fertilized ovules.
Pomares-Viciana et al. BMC Plant Biology           (2019) 19:61 
Page 14 of 20
Particularly, downregulation of AGL16, involved in re-
pression of floral transition, suggested that the transi-
tion from floral stage to fruit stage occurred [32].
However, there were no common genes between cul-
tivars during auxin treatment suggesting that different
pathways related to MADS-box proteins were induced
(Additional file 5).
TFs of HD-Zip family reduced their expression during
zucchini fruit set as previously reported in tomato fruit
[22]. Downregulation of HAT5 and strong downregula-
tion of ATHB-40 were also occurred in tomato fruit
(Additional file 5), showing that these genes could play
key roles in fruit development regulation [22]. In
addition, this downregulation may be mediated by hor-
mones accumulation in fruit tissues induced by pollin-
ation or auxin treatment [7]. Increased levels of auxins
and ABA during fruit set may produce downregulation
of ATHB-40 [33] and ATHB7 [34], respectively.
Carbohydrate metabolism is induced by pollination and
auxin treatment
Carbohydrates are major category of compounds that in-
clude among others: reducing (glucose and fructose), non
reducing (sucrose) sugars, starches and cellulose which play
an important role in the structure, function of all cells and
are crucial factors that influence fruit quality [35, 36]. High
levels of glucose and fructose were found after pollination
and auxin treatment in zucchini fruit, indicating that the
imported photoassimilates becoming mainly glucose and
fructose in these first phases of fruit development and to a
lesser extend to sucrose and starch (Fig. 5). Increased of
these carbohydrates could be a consequence of glycolisis
activation by enolase 1, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate de-
hydrogenase and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase during
pollinated fruit set [18]. Enolase 1 synthesizes pyruvate
from D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate [37], glyceraldehyde-
3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPC-1) catalyzes the first
step of the pathway by converting D-glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate into 3-phospho-D-glyceroyl phosphate [38],
and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase is involved in a sub-
pathway that synthesizes D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
and glycerone phosphate from D-glucose (Additional file 6)
[39]. These enzymes are essential not only for carbohydrate
metabolism but also for proper fruit development, because
they can regulate seed and fruit development. Gapc-1 null
mutant showed low seed number, altered embryo develop-
ment and apical morphological alterations in siliques in
Arabidopsis [38]. Thus, its over-expression may be caused
the proper fruit growth observed in pollinated fruit in
zucchini [5].
In the case of auxin treatment, high levels of fructose
and glucose may be due to the activation of fructose
6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase, pyruvate kinase and
phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxykinase 1, enzymes also
involved in glycolisis and gluconeogenesis [35]. Fructose
6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase catalyzes the phos-
phorylation of D-fructose 6-phosphate and can thus
function both in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis [40],
and pyruvate kinase catalyses the irreversible synthesis
of pyruvate and ATP, which are both used in multiple
biochemical pathways [41].
Complex carbohydrates as starch are formed by linkage
of monosaccharides as glucose and fructose [36], however
low levels of starch were found during pollinated/ auxin
treated fruit set in spite of over expression of enzymes re-
lated to starch (Fig. 5, Additional file 6). These evidences
suggest that fruit set induced the availability of glucose
and fructose free, not linked in complex polymers.
Nevertheless, glucose and fructose levels were lower
during parthenocarpic fruit set (Fig. 5), despite the activa-
tion of pyruvate kinase or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
(Additional file 6).
Auxin, ethylene and gibberellin interaction regulates fruit
set in zucchini
The activation of auxin and gibberellin signalling path-
ways, associated with repression of ethylene signals, trig-
ger fruit set in Arabidopsis or tomato, [42], but the role
of these hormones is still poorly understood in zucchini
fruit set, probably because only few components of these
signalling pathways have been indentified and few re-
searches on fruit set has been carried out [5, 43].
Auxins play a critical role in the development of zuc-
chini fruit [42, 44, 45]. RNA-seq showed that genes re-
lated to this hormone were the most representative in
pollinated fruit and auxin treated fruit. Processes related
to auxin signalling were enriched during pollination
(Fig. 7) and application of synthetic auxins induced fruit
growth in zucchini, causing the development of the
ovary into an induced parthenocarpic fruit, suggesting
its key role in fruit set [21, 45]. The majority of DEGs
related to auxin were up-regulated, and most of them
belong to Aux/IAA and PIN families (Fig. 7). Current
models suggest that Aux/IAA genes encode nuclear pro-
teins which form heterodimers with ARFs, and these
heterodimers restrain the transcription of the early auxin
response
genes
[46–48].
However,
it
was
found
over-expression of IAA4, IAA14 and IAA16 during fruit
set not only in zucchini but also in tomato [22]. This
particular regulation of these IAAs during fruit set, sug-
gest that a minimum level of Aux/IAAs is required in
order to create a negative feedback loop in the auxin sig-
nal transduction pathway, which enables the plant to
fine-tune the strength of the auxin response. Moreover,
over-expression of PIN1, PIN6 and WAT-1 found in zuc-
chini fruit (Fig. 7), suggested that auxin response is also
mediated by auxin polar transport in fruit tissues [42].
This regulation is translated into cell division and into

Page 15 of 20
cross-talk with other hormones such as ethylene and
gibberellins [31, 42], most representative hormones
together auxins during zucchini fruit (Fig. 7). Probably,
downregulation
of
ethylene
related
genes
(Fig.
7,
Additional file 7) in zucchini fruit is caused by auxin.
Addition of synthetic auxin or pollination has significant
effects on the expression of the auxin related genes,
regulating negatively ethylene production and signalling
during fruit set [43]. ACO1, ACO3, ETR2 and EIN3-like
genes were downregulated during fruit set (Fig. 7), and
this downregulation has also reported previously in zuc-
chini fruit [43], indicating that that ethylene production
needs to be prevented for a proper fruit set. This cross-
talk between auxin and ethylene has also been reported
in tomato [21], displaying that the mRNA levels of sev-
eral ethylene biosynthesis genes and genes involved in
ethylene signalling decreased after pollination and re-
cently, ETR2 inhibition resulted in earlier fruit set [49].
At the same time, downregulation of ABA biosynthesis
related genes (Fig. 7), NCED1 and NCED3, occurred,
suggested that auxin response also may imply the at-
tenuation of ABA response [50]. Conversely, cluster ana-
lysis of DEGs revealed the strongly over-expression of a
key role in gibberellin signalling (Fig. 7), GA20ox1 and
downregulation of genes related with gibberellin catabol-
ism (GID family), indicating that fruit set depends not
only on auxin signalling activation but also on induction
of gibberellin signalling pathway (Fig. 7). Similar regula-
tion of these genes has been described previously in Ara-
bidopsis and tomato during fruit development [8, 42]. In
the case of Arabidopsis, GA20ox1 expression was in-
creased in the ovules, whereas GA2ox gene expression
was downregulated. Moreover, in the case of tomato
fruit, GID1B and GA2ox genes were downregulated in
contrast to GA20ox1 during fruit set, which was strongly
up-regulated. However, this regulation does not appear
to be independent of auxin, since auxin stimulates gib-
berellin biosynthesis through the transcriptional activa-
tion of GA20ox1 [8, 42]. These findings suggested that
zucchini fruit development depends on the successful
activation of the auxin and gibberellin signalling path-
ways as occurred in tomato.
Key genes for parthenocarpic fruit set in zucchini
Coordination between auxin, ethylene and gibberellin
signalling pathways has proven to be an essential process
for fruit set also in zucchini. The role of these hormones
is still unknown in parthenocarpic process in zucchini.
Differential expression analysis carried out in this assay
have revealed a group of genes that showed the same
regulation during pollinated/auxin treated and partheno-
carpic fruit set (Additional file 7). ARF18, PIN1B, PIN8
and LAX1 were up-regulated like GA20ox1 and GASA4
gibberellin related genes This expression profile was
similar to found in tomato or Arabidopsis, indicating the
important role of these genes in parthenocarpy [22, 42].
Remarkably, over-expression of GA20ox1 gene seems to
be crucial for fruit set and parthenocarpy process in zuc-
chini. Moreover, this gene regulated fruit set in coordin-
ation of auxin signalling through the transcriptional
activation of ARFs/IAAs as ARF18 [42]. The activation of
auxin signaling repressed ethylene response in zucchini
[43]. This repression was also observed during partheno-
carpic fruit set through downregulation of ACO1, ETR2,
ERF11 or ERF17 (Additional file 7). Gene expression
analysis of this subset of genes has represented an im-
portant advance in parthenocarpy study in zucchini, and
makes possible the introduction of this knowledge in
breeding programmes.
Conclusions
In the present work, transcriptomic changes that take
place in zucchini during fruit set have been analysed and
compared in two contrasting cultivars for this process,
Whitaker,
parthenocarpic
fruit
set,
and
MUCU-16,
non-parthenocarpic fruit set. This study also highlights
the crucial role of some pathways including cell cycle,
regulation of transcription and carbohydrate metabolism
during fruit set in zucchini. Moreover, it was elucidated
the important role of hormones during fruit set, estab-
lishing the activating role of auxins and gibberellins
against the inhibitory role of ethylene. Functional ana-
lysis of RNA-Seq data have revealed different candidate
genes that could be useful as markers for parthenocarpic
selection in the current breeding programs of zucchini.
Methods
Plants materials, growth conditions and treatments
Two cultivars of Cucurbita pepo spp. pepo morphotype zuc-
chini were used in this study, the non-parthenocarpic culti-
var MUCU-16 (held in COMAV-UPV Genbank, accession
BGV004370,
https://www.comav.upv.es/index.php/databa-
sesgermplasm/databases/genebank-database) [20], and the
parthenocarpic cultivar Whitaker (developed in CORNELL
College of Agriculture and Life Science, Geneva, New York,
USA) [4]. Those varieties are results of independent trad-
itional breeding process. Seed germination and plant cultiva-
tion were performed following standard local practices, with
the appropriate permissions to growth plants in a green-
house of the IFAPA research centre in Almeria (Spain). A
mean of 14 h photoperiod, mean daily air temperature of 24
/15 C day/night and relative humidity of 75% were regis-
tered in the greenhouse during the experiment.
Female flowers of the above cultivars, at 100 days post
transplanting, were protected with paper bags in order
to prevent pollen contamination on the day before an-
thesis. This was followed by three kinds of treatments
on each protected flower: non-pollination, pollination

and auxin treatment. Paper bags were removed at 1 DPA
(day post anthesis) to claim that ovaries were not polli-
nated in non-pollination treatment. In the case of pollin-
ation, paper bags were removed in anthesis and female
flowers were self-pollinated by hand early in the morning.
In the case of auxin treatment paper bags were removed
in anthesis and female flowers were treated with 0.5 ml of
0.8% of synthetic auxin “fruitone” (0.45% 1-naphthalene
acetic acid, 1.2% 1-naphthaleneacetamide) for pollinated
treatment and auxin treatment, respectively. Ovaries were
collected for each treatment from different plants at 2 days
post anthesis.
RNA-Seq analysis
Six fruit samples were collected for RNA-seq analysis,
i.e. unpollinated fruit of MUCU-16 (UF MU16), polli-
nated fruit of MUCU-16 (PF MU16), auxin treated fruit
of MUCU-16 (AF MU16), unpollinated fruit of Whitaker
(UF WHI), pollinated fruit of Whitaker (PF WHI) and
auxin treated fruit of Whitaker (AF WHI). For samples
collection, three biological replicates were performed (20
ovaries in each replicate). All collected samples were im-
mediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored a −80 °C
until further analysis.
Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plant Mini
Kit from (QIAGEN, Germany). 6 libraries for sequencing
were constructed for 6 RNA samples, and each sample
was the resultant mix of three RNA extraction, one of
each sample replication. RNA samples were sent to
STABvida (Caparica, Portugal) for RNA-Seq analysis.
RNA quality control was performed to evaluate integrity
and concentration using Agilen 2200 Tape Station sys-
tem (Agilent technologies, CA, USA). All the samples
were within suitable parameters, RNA amount > 10 μg
and RIN > 6.9. Library construction of cDNA molecules
was carried out using Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA
Library Preparation Kit, following manufacter’s instruc-
tions. Generate DNA fragments (cDNA libraries) were
sequenced in the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform, using
100 bp paired-end sequencing reads.
Gene quantification and differential expression analysis
Generated sequence raw data was analyzed using CLC
Genomics Worbench 10.0.1. High quality sequencing
reads were mapped against the Curcubita pepo tran-
scriptome v3 and a processed version of this transcrip-
tome after removal of alternatives sequences, using the
following parameters length fraction of 0.80 (at least
80% of the alignment must match the reference se-
quence before the read is included in the mapping) and
similarity fraction of 0.80 (identity should be at least
80% for the read to be included in the mapping). Map-
ping served to determine the gene expression levels
based on the TPM (Transcripts per Million) [51].
Bioconductor package EdgeR was applied to identify
differentially expressed genes with multi-factorial stat-
istical analysis tool based on a negative binomial
model [52]. A p-value could denote its expression dif-
ference between two libraries, and false discovery
rates (FDRs) were used to determine the threshold of
p-value. Differentially expressed genes were filtered
using standard conditions, fold change (≥2 or ≤−2)
and FDR p-Value ≤0.05 [53, 54].
Gene annotation and gene ontology term enrichment
analysis of DEGs
Gene annotation was performed by comparing sequences
using algorithm blastn or blastx (cut off e-value of 1e-25)
implemented by the program Blast2GO v.4.3.1 [55] with
public databases, Arabidopsis genome and Arabidopsis
proteins from TAIR [56], Swissprot [57] and GenBank
non redundant nucleotide database (nr) from NCBI [58].
Also, blastn search comparison (cut off e value of
1e-25) was performed with Cucurbita pepo ssp. ovi-
fera [59], and Cucurbita maxima [60], and with the
last versions of Cucurbita pepo genome from Cucur-
bigene (https://bioinf.comav.upv.es/downloads/zucchini
/genome_v4.1/). DEGs were scanned against InterPro
database [61] to assign Gene Ontology terms to zuc-
chini genes [62], and GO annotations were mapped
to the plant-specific GO slim ontology using Blas-
t2GO with default parameters. Enzyme code mapping
was perfomed using GO annotations and pathways
The GO term enrichment analysis was conducted
using a cut-off p-value of 0.05 for significant repre-
sented GO Terms and corrections for p-value were
performed using FDR (false discovery rate). KEGG
[63] was used to identified metabolic pathways in
DEGs for further understanding genes functions.
Total sugar measurement
Quantification of sugars in zucchini fruits was con-
ducted using the same samples that have been applied to
RNAseq analysis. 12 mg of fruit material were extracted
twice with 80% ethanol solution (80% ethanol, 2.5 mM
HEPES, pH 7.5) at 95 °C for 30 min, followed by one ex-
traction with 50% ethanol solution (50% ethanol, 2.5
mM HEPES, pH 7.5). The supernatants were combined
and used for assaying total soluble sugars, glucose, fruc-
tose and sucrose by measuring the difference of absorb-
ance at 340 nm in buffer (75 mM HEPES/KOH pH 7,
2.3 mM ATP, 1 mM NADP and glucose-6-phosphate de-
hydrogenase) after sequencing adding of hexokinase,
phosphoglucose, isomerase, and invertase. For starch de-
termination, the pellets of the ethanol extraction were
solubized by heating them to 95 °C in 0.1 M NaOH for
30 min. After acidification with an HCl/sodium-acetate

mixture pH 4.9, part of the suspension was digested
overnight with amyloglucosidase and α-amylase. The
glucose content of the supernant was then used to assess
the starch content of the sample by measuring the differ-
ence in absorbance at 340 nm after adding hexokinase in
the same buffer mentioned above.
