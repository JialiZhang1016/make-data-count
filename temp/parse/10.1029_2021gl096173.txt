1.  Introduction
Aviation outflow is the only anthropogenic source of pollution that is directly emitted into the upper troposphere. 
This emission has the potential to modify the cloudiness directly by forming linear contrails and indirectly by 
injecting water vapor and aerosols (Minnis et al., 1999, 2013; Lee et al., 2021), on which ice crystals may form 
homogeneously or heterogeneously if aerosols act as ice nucleating particles (INP). Depending on meteorological 
and aircraft parameters, early contrail evolution may potentially affect the microphysical properties of evolving 
contrail even hours later (Unterstrasser & Gierens, 2010). The number of surviving ice particles due to adiabatic 
heating in the downward moving vortices depends strongly on ambient relative humidity with respect to ice (RHi) 
and temperature (Unterstrasser, 2014; Unterstrasser & Sölch, 2010). The initial RHi may also impact contrail 
structure in which low RHi can lead to sublimation of all ice crystals inside the vortices even before the primary 
wake ceases (Huebsch & Lewellen, 2006; Unterstrasser, 2014; Unterstrasser & Sölch, 2010). According to the 
work by Unterstrasser (2014), once the environment is cold and moist enough more ice crystals will survive in 
the primary wake and a contrail reaches its full vertical extent of about 450 m after about 5 min. By perform-
ing an idealized simulation of a single contrail cluster and studying its microphysical process rates, Bock and 
Burkhardt (2016b) showed that young contrail cirrus and natural cirrus are very distinct in microphysical proper-
ties, with a large number of small ice crystal concentration (diameter <1 μm) in young contrails while a smaller 
number of large ice crystals (diameter greater than 5–10 μm) in natural cirrus. According to their work, contrail 
cirrus resembles natural cirrus regarding their ice crystal number concentration and size after 5–7 hr.
Abstract  Contrails can persist in cloud-free supersaturated air, increasing high-cloud cover, and inside 
natural cirrus cloud, modifying the microphysical properties of them. The latter effect is almost unknown, 
partly because of the lack of height-resolved measurements and the capability of measurements to penetrate 
inside the cloud. New retrievals of the ice crystal number concentration from combined satellite cloud radar and 
lidar measurements (CloudSat/CALIPSO; DARDAR-Nice algorithm) now allow for satellite-based assessment 
inside the clouds. We investigate this issue at intersections between the aircraft flight tracks and these retrieval 
profiles. Regions behind the aircraft inside the flight track were compared to the adjacent regions and to ahead 
of the aircraft, along the satellites' profiles, where DARDAR-Nice identify geometrically thin cirrus clouds. 
This comparison revealed a statistically significant increase of 25% and 54% in the concentration of ice crystals 
with the minimum size of 5 μm around 300–540-m beneath an aircraft's flight altitude.
Plain Language Summary  Aircraft emissions are the only human-made source of pollution that is 
directly injected into the upper troposphere. Aircraft can form trails of ice crystals in a cloud-free atmosphere 
and therefore change the high-cloud cover. If they form inside the already existing cirrus clouds, they will 
modify the cloud microphysical properties, an effect that is not well quantified so far. In this study, we use 
a new retrieval of ice crystal number concentration from satellite lidar and radar, which provides height 
resolved information. We analyze intersections between the aircraft flight tracks and the swath of the satellite 
by comparing the ice crystal concentration in the regions affected by aviation with the neighboring regions 
and those ahead of the aircraft. The result of this work reveals a statistically significant increase in ice crystal 
concentration within clouds a few hundred meters beneath the flight height.

Contrail ice particles grow by the uptake of moisture from the surrounding atmosphere. Using a coupled model, 
Schumann et al. (2015) found that the mass of water in aged contrails may be 10 3–10 6 times larger than the water 
emitted from aircraft. Knollenberg (1972) used measurements for a single aircraft and found this value exceeded 
at least four orders of magnitude. This causes drying at flight levels and redistributing the humidity to lower levels 
(Fahey & Schumann, 1999; Schumann et al., 2015) and therefore a significant decrease in natural cloudiness 
(Burkhardt & Kärcher, 2011; Schumann et al., 2015). Gierens (2012) investigated contrail development within 
cirrus clouds by means of analytical calculations and found that embedded contrails lead to a local decrease in 
mean crystal radius and a local increase in mean ice crystal number concentration compared to the unperturbed 
cloud. However, according to their analysis cirrus ice crystals as the ambient atmosphere of the contrail, have a 
negligible contribution during contrail formation and may only play a role in dispersing contrails some hours after 
formation by aggregating small contrail ice crystals via falling large cirrus ice crystals.
Aviation soot aerosols that are directly emitted at cirrus altitudes have been shown to act as INP (Kanji 
et al., 2017). However, the indirect effect of aviation soot on cirrus clouds is subject to considerable uncertainties, 
especially due to the uncertainty in the ice nucleation efficiency of aircraft soot particles. A recent laboratory 
study observed that the ice active fraction of aviation soot would increase significantly by increasing its porosity. 
They found that if soot aggregates contain mesopores, they can contribute to ice formation even below homo-
geneous freezing conditions of solution droplets (Mahrt et al., 2020). Applying a high-resolution cirrus column 
model revealed that at most, 1% of the contrail-processed soot particles are ice active (Kärcher et al., 2021). Righi 
et al. (2021) conducted sensitivity experiments with a global aerosol-climate model exploring the uncertainties 
in the effect of aviation soot on cirrus clouds. They showed that depending on the assumptions on critical ice 
saturation ratio and active fraction of aviation soot, the radiative forcing (RF) from the aviation soot-cirrus effect 
ranged from −35 to 13 mW m −2.
Radiative impact of contrails and contrail cirrus has been studied by introducing them as an independent cloud 
class in global climate models (Bock & Burkhardt, 2016a, 2016b, 2019; Burkhardt & Kärcher, 2009, 2011; 
Gettelman & Chen, 2013) or by coupling contrail cirrus simulation models with reanalysis data (Schumann & 
Graf, 2013). Aviation-induced RF due to the effects on cirrus has had an increasing trend since 2011 with its 
contribution being greater than aviation CO2 emission (Kärcher, 2018). Contrails and contrail cirrus are found to 
have a warming effect on the atmosphere (Bock & Burkhardt, 2016b, 2019; Boucher, 1999; Kärcher, 2017, 2018; 
Schumann, 2005). However, there is still a large range of uncertainty about aviation-induced cloud RF (Lee 
et al., 2021), even though the observations before and during the aircraft shutdown related to the COVID-19 
pandemic shed some light on the overall effect (Quaas et al., 2021).
Observational studies of contrails and contrail cirrus are mostly based on passive remote sensing from space 
(Duda et al., 2013, 2019; Minnis et al., 1999, 2013). These measurements generally relate to conditions at cloud 
top or to cloud columnar properties. Therefore, they cannot be used to investigate the conditions at the flight 
level of a passing aircraft inside the existing cirrus cloud. Observational results of lidar instruments that are 
capable of detecting optically very thin or sub-visible cirrus clouds, suggest that most persistent contrails are 
embedded within pre-existing cirrus clouds (Immler et al., 2008; Iwabuchi et al., 2012; Sassen, 1997). This is 
because ice supersaturation, which is needed for cirrus formation, is also required for contrail persistence (Schu-
mann, 1996). These embedded contrails can be recognized as backscatter peaks in airborne lidar observations 
(Jones et al., 2012; Unterstrasser, 2016; Voigt et al., 2017). Sassen (1997) presented the first lidar-based investi-
gation of embedded contrails and confirmed that contrails within clouds increase cloud optical thickness (COT). 
Furthermore, Minnis et al. (2013) show that contrails can also decrease the mean particle size of existing cirrus 
clouds.
Active remote-sensing measurements with spaceborne lidar or radar can be used not only to obtain the base and 
top heights of cirrus clouds but also to derive height-resolved information of their optical and microphysical prop-
erties (Hong & Liu, 2015; Iwabuchi et al., 2012). The first work that quantified the effect of contrails on the COT 
of already existing cirrus clouds statistically was by Tesche et al. (2016). According to their work, COT increases 
significantly when a contrail forms in an already existing cirrus. While optically thin cirrus can have a warming 
effect on the earth system, optically thick cirrus has a net cooling effect due to the dominance of the solar albedo 
effect (Hong & Liu, 2015). Therefore, the increment of COT has the potential of overturning the sign of ice cloud 
RF from net warming to net cooling (Hong & Liu, 2015; Zhang et al., 1999).

Even though the situation that an aircraft flies through a natural cirrus is one of the highly probable situations 
in the upper troposphere, its subsequent impact is unclear with the present state of knowledge. Quantifying such 
impact is necessary if we are to properly account for the influence of aviation on climate. One main limitation 
preventing us to better identify these impacts is the lack of microphysical measurements inside the cirrus clouds. 
Ice crystal number concentration (Ni) is one of the essential radiative and microphysical properties of ice clouds. 
However, its estimation based on remote-sensing techniques is still very challenging. In the present work, we 
investigate effects of aviation on Ni of already existing cirrus clouds using the joint observation by CloudSat radar 
and CALIPSO lidar (DARDAR-Nice, see next section) retrievals and by applying the methodology introduced by 
Tesche et al. (2016). Almost all previous studies on aviation lack the possibility to look deep into the clouds, but 
here these retrievals provide unprecedented possibility to investigate Ni with vertically resolved values in details.
2.  Data Description
This work presents results based on a novel approach to estimate ice number concentration (Ni) from combined 
Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO; Winker et al., 2009) and Cloud-
Sat (Stephens et al., 2002, 2018) measurements, called DARDAR-Nice (liDAR-raDAR-number concentration 
of ICE particles, Sourdeval et al., 2018a). These Ni are retrieved based on the VarCloud algorithm (Delanoë & 
Hogan, 2010), along the CloudSat footprint with a vertical resolution of 60 m and horizontal resolution of 1 km. 
They provided ice crystal concentration with the minimum size of 5 μm and are available from 2006 to 2017. A 
major strength of merging spaceborne lidar and radar measurements is that it allows for providing vertical profiles 
of the ice crystal number concentration for a large variety of ice cloud types. The product has been evaluated 
against theoretical considerations and in situ measurements and the best agreement is found at temperatures 
below −30°C, as the retrievals are more accurate due to the dominance of unimodal ice crystal size distribution 
and reduced ambiguity in the cloud phase (Sourdeval et al., 2018a). We use the data set of intercepts between 
individual aircraft and the track of the CALIPSO satellite produced by Tesche et al. (2016). The flight tracks for 
these aircraft passages are between the west coast of the continental United States (Seattle, San Francisco, and 
Los Angeles) and Hawaii (within the area 15–55°N and 115–155°W) which took place during 2010 and 2011. 
For further information please refer to Tesche et al. (2016).
3.  Methodology
The approach in this research is built upon testing the null hypothesis that “Aviation pollution within natural 
cirrus clouds in the upper troposphere has no measurable immediate effect on ice crystal number concentra-
tions.” If our null hypothesis is true, then there should be no statistically significant differences in the number 
of ice crystals between part of the clouds that are affected by the aircraft and other parts of the cloud. If there 
is a statistically significant difference between affected and clean parts of the cirrus clouds, the null hypothesis 
is rejected and we conclude that aviation pollution within natural cirrus clouds has an immediate effect on ice 
crystal number concentrations.
The basis of choosing some appropriate aircraft cases to analyze their impact on already existing cirrus clouds 
is the identification of intersection coordinates between individual aircraft and height-resolved spaceborne lidar 
observations. Furthermore, for the scope of this work, some constraints needed to be applied on discovered collo-
cated pixels, like considering the effect of advection and the pre-existence of cirrus clouds. Intercepts between 
aircraft flight track and the track of the satellite are classified into two groups. In the first group, called here 
“behind” the aircraft, first the aircraft passes from the intersection coordinate and then the satellite passes. There-
fore, the satellite recorded information about cloudy air parcels behind the aircraft, i.e., affected by the aircraft. 
In the second group named as “ahead” of the aircraft, the aircraft passes the intersection point after the satellite 
overpass, so the satellite profile is not affected by this aircraft. As our intention is to dissect the natural cirrus 
clouds that are affected by aviation, existence of cirrus cloud at flight level in the collocated pixels is also one of 
the main conditions that is considered in the selection of the cases by Tesche et al. (2016).
Examples for a height-resolved view of the embedded contrail of an aircraft in cirrus cloud are illustrated in 
Figure 1. The turbulent nature of the clouds implies that it is virtually impossible to distinguish aviation traits 
by looking into just a few cases. Instead, a statistical analysis of several to many cases is required. This chaotic 
intrinsic variability is even stronger for geometrically thick cirrus (Figures 1a and 1b), i.e., clouds that are more

usually related to fast updrafts or convective systems (Krämer et al., 2016, 2020). Therefore, in order to identify 
any aviation impact on already existing cirrus clouds, the focus here is only on thin cirrus clouds, defined here as 
cirrus clouds with geometrical thickness of <2 km (Figures 1c and 1d). As investigated by Krämer et al. (2016), 
we can interpret that in situ origin cirrus clouds (forming in slow updraft) are mainly investigated in this study 
rather than liquid-origin cirrus clouds. The geometrical thickness of cirrus clouds in this study is distributed 
between 900 and 2,000 m.
Using this methodology, an overall number of 26 cases are selected, including 12 cases ahead of an aircraft 
(control case) and 14 cases behind an aircraft (perturbed case with possible aircraft impact on cirrus). These cases 
are a subset of intercepts that were used in Tesche et al. (2016), though we examined them in a different data prod-
uct. Table 1 shows the intersection coordinates, the atmospheric temperature of the selected cases, and the abso-
lute time difference between aircraft and CALIPSO arrival time, which is <30 min for all cases. For the selection 
of cirrus clouds, Tesche et al. (2016) considered sevens 5 km CALIOP data points to the north and south of the 
intersection coordinate. Which means 35 km on both sides of the intersection coordinate. Moreover, according to 
Tesche et al. (2016), here, we just considered cases associated with <30 km advection displacement (advection 
displacement for most of the cases are even <20 km). Therefore, with the assumption that the effect of a passing 
aircraft is observable in close neighborhood to the flight track, we define grid points on the satellite profile with 
<20-km distance from the center as inside the flight track and the next 15 km both sides as outside the flight 
track. Accordingly, our selected cases are classified into four categories (schematic illustration in Figure 2); (I) 
ahead the aircraft inside the flight track, (II) ahead the aircraft outside the flight track, (III) behind the aircraft 
inside the flight track, and (IV) behind the aircraft outside the flight track. As in Tesche et al. (2016), we test our 
proposed null hypothesis in two complementary manners. First by comparing affected part of the cirrus clouds 
with adjacent regions on the cloud (categories III to IV), the latter category is outside the flight track and assumed 
as unperturbed region and second by comparing affected part of the cloud with cirrus clouds ahead of the aircraft 
(categories III to I), this latter category is located inside the flight track but aircraft will reach this region in 
<30 min. Therefore, this category is also assumed as unperturbed region but from a different perspective. If the 
null hypothesis is true and aviation has no measurable immediate effect on the number of ice crystals then there 
should be no statistically significant differences in the number of ice crystals between the category that is affected 
by the aircraft and other categories that are not affected.

4.  Results
Statistics of Ni are shown in Figure 3a, comparing the affected part of the 
cirrus clouds (category III, in red) with neighboring regions (category IV, 
in black). As we wanted to investigate inside the cloud, distances >540-m 
beneath the flight height are not considered owing to the fact that, if we go 
further below, the cloud base will be reach in some cases. Notable differ-
ences are recorded in the three lowest illustrated height levels, i.e., between 
300-m and 540-m beneath the flight height. These differences are prominent 
in the upper quartiles and upper extremes, arising from increasing values 
in category III while decreasing values in category IV as distancing from 
the flight level. As will be shown in Figure 4, the average Ni in category III 
(aviation affected cirrus) is 25% greater than category IV (natural cirrus), at 
300–540-m beneath the flight height. This result suggests that the local effect 
of an embedded contrail on the assessed Ni as retrieved by DARDAR-Nice is 
more substantial a few hundred meters beneath the flight height. Even though 
the p-value of our analyses 300-m beneath the flight height is greater than the 
conventionally predefined threshold of 0.05, these numbers reveal that the 
confidence levels for the rejection of the proposed null hypothesis are >95% 
and 99%, at 420-m and 540-m beneath the flight height respectively.
1.	 p-value > 0.05 → null hypothesis valid → no effect of aviation on cirrus
2.	 p-value < 0.05 → null hypothesis rejected → effect of aviation on cirrus
Comparing cirrus clouds holding contrails (category III, in red) with those 
located ahead of the aircraft (category I, in black) in Figure 3b shows a simi-
lar pattern of result as that in Figure 3a. Box and whiskers show higher values 
in category III, at 300–540-m beneath the flight level compared to counter-
part heights ahead of the aircraft. The average value in category III is 54% 
greater than in category I, at 300–540-m beneath the flight height (Figure 4). 
p-Values for the three lowest illustrated height levels are even <0.01, imply-
ing that these two groups of clouds have a difference that is statistically 
significant with a confidence level of >99%. It should be noted that, when 
category III is compared to category IV, every single case has a counterpart 
in the other category, which are taken under the similar meteorological situ-
ation. Accordingly, despite the lower p-values in Figure 3b, these differences 
could partly arise from different background effects of the cases.
Average profiles of Ni in Figure  4a show a decreasing trend from flight 
level to the lower altitudes in both categories I (ahead aircraft, inside flight 
track) and II (ahead aircraft, outside flight track). When looking at average 
values in behind the aircraft (Figure 4b), the vertical trend increases from 
flight level to the lower altitudes in category III (behind aircraft, inside flight 
track: aviation affected cirrus), whereas, averages decline from flight level to 
nearby lower altitudes in category IV (behind aircraft, outside flight track). 
Vertical variability in category III (aviation affected cirrus) is different from 
all other categories. This difference probably arises from the presence of 
embedded contrails inside the clouds. When considering average Ni values 
for individual cases, the chaotic nature of cirrus clouds manifests in the large 
intraindividual variability in each group of cases (thin lines in Figures 4a 
and 4b). It is interesting to note that even when we consider all the available 
cases irrespective of their thicknesses (26 cases ahead of the aircraft and 33 
cases behind the aircraft) we identified the same signal though far weaker 
signal. Therefore, considering the statistically significant difference in the 
number of ice crystals between category III with categories I and IV. Our null

hypothesis is rejected and we can conclude that the passage of aircraft through an already existing cirrus cloud 
have an immediate effect on the number of ice crystals and will increase the number of ice crystals greater than 
5 μm a few hundred meters beneath the flight height.
These findings are consistent with previous studies of three-dimensional simulations, which show that in a cold 
and humid enough environment, contrails can reach a vertical extent of >450 m during the vortex phase (Unter-
strasser, 2014). In another word, if the supersaturation at cruising altitude is high enough, most of those ice 
crystals that are trapped inside the aircraft vortices will survive during the descending vortex phase (Huebsch & 
Lewellen, 2006; Lewellen & Lewellen, 2001; Lewellen et al., 2014) and consequently a certain fraction of contrail 
ice crystals will be displaced a few hundred meters beneath the flight level. Given that we study inside the already 
existing cirrus clouds which ice supersaturation is the presumption for their existence, we can conclude that the 
saturation at aircraft altitude is high enough for the young contrails to develop and reach the full vertical extension 
during the vortex phase. Furthermore, considering the time delay between the aircraft and satellite passage, these 
contrails are young enough to be further controlled by aircraft induced flow rather than the atmospheric param-
eters (i.e., mostly affected by vortex phase rather than dissipation phase). Mean diameter of ice crystals in young 
contrails (up to 1 hr) is typically smaller than 10 μm (Bock & Burkhardt, 2016b; Schröder et al., 2000). It is even 
less than in the young cirrus clouds, which were found to be 10–20 μm (Schröder et al., 2000). Therefore, it is 
possible that we have lost information about a certain fraction of contrail's ice crystals, those which are smaller 
than the retrieved threshold of 5 μm in DARDAR-Nice product. Considering that the contrails in this study 
are all younger than 30 min and given that the sedimentation velocity of ice crystals is prolonged in ice clouds 
(Khvorostyanov & Curry, 2002; Nee et al., 2016), high concentration of small ice crystals may exist in closer 
distances to flight altitude due to contrail formation. Therefore, the reason why Ni increment in this work is just 
identified a few hundred meters beneath the flight height but not at closer distances could be because of the lack

Vertical axis represents height relative to the aircraft altitude. Boxes show the 25th–75th percentiles of the data, whiskers 
the 5th–95th percentiles; the middle bar is the median value. In both panels, the red boxes are the same, namely category III 
(behind the aircraft, inside flight track). In (a), the black boxes are category IV (behind the aircraft, outside the flight track), 
in (b) category I (ahead the aircraft, inside the flight track), i.e., two different choices for the control case. Two-tailed p-values 
calculated from t-score are indicated in right-hand side of each height level. If the p-value is less than the significance level of 
0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected (i.e., aviation do have effect on already existing cirrus).

of information about ice crystals smaller than 5 μm. Larger contrail ice crystals can be located toward the bottom 
of the cloud, partly because smaller crystals sublimate during the adiabatic heating in descending vortices which 
in turn help to preserve the saturation for growth of the larger crystals and partly due to the aggregation processes 
during the descending vortex flow. Hence, it should be noticed that if the amount of ice crystals smaller than 
5 μm in the contrail is larger in the closer vertical distances to flight height than the overall contrail ice crystals 
in the farther distances (here 300–540-m beneath the flight height), the maximum difference of Ni, between the 
categories, could be found in a different height and with a different quantity of increment.
5.  Conclusion
This study evaluates the immediate effect of aviation effluent on the number of ice crystals within geometrically 
thin natural cirrus clouds by exploiting satellite observations. With this aim, we used DARDAR-Nice retrievals 
that provide height-resolved product of Ni from spaceborne radar and lidar observations at the location of inter-
cepts with individual flight tracks. These flights took place between the west coast of the continental United 
States (Seattle, San Francisco, and Los Angeles) and Hawaii during 2010 and 2011, as identified in Tesche 
et al. (2016).
Comparing ice crystals with minimum diameter of 5 μm in cloudy air behind the aircraft inside the flight track 
to the adjacent regions and to ahead of the aircraft revealed a notable difference in ice number concentration at 
300–540-m beneath the flight height. These differences are derived from the reduction of ice number concen-
trations as we proceed toward the cloud base in regions unaffected by aviation (regions I, II, and IV) and the 
increase of ice crystals as we distance a few hundreds of meters beneath the flight level in the regions affected 
by aviation (region III). The differences are particularly pronounced for the upper percentiles of the distribution. 
In some cases, thus, there is a very large perturbation of Ni due to the aircraft (almost a factor of two), while on 
average, the effects are only 25% and 54% in comparison to neighboring regions and ahead the aircraft respec-
tively. p-Values also confirm that these differences are statistically significant with the confidence level of >99%, 
except between regions III and IV, 300-m beneath the flight altitude, which exhibited a confidence level of 82%.

In this work, we just considered ice crystals with minimum diameter of 5 μm, due to the limitations of the satellite 
observations that cannot retrieve smaller ice crystals. However, previous studies have revealed that ice crystals 
in young contrails are diminutive and myriad, i.e., smaller and more numerous than in natural cirrus clouds 
(Baumgardner & Gandrud, 1998; Bock & Burkhardt, 2016b; Sassen, 1997; Schumann, 1996). Thus, it should 
be noted that depending on the concentration of ice crystals smaller than 5 μm, the ice crystal increment due to 
aviation impact could be found distinctly, i.e., instead of 300–540-m beneath the flight height, an increment of 
Ni from flight altitude to 540-m beneath that could be discovered. Therefore, this result is only valid for the ice 
crystal larger than 5 μm. Furthermore, while the data presented here are based on a limited number of cases, the 
findings are statistically significant. But in the future, more robust studies will need to be based on much larger 
data sets of intercepts between satellites and the tracks of individual aircraft. Work that is currently underway at
