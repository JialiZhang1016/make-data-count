Abstract 
Ecuador has a great variety of climatic regions that potentiate 
biodiversity. The family Orchidaceae constitutes one of the most 
important of the country, having identified about 4032 species with a 
high degree of endemism, therefore the development and research of 
alternative methods of storage and conservation of species is a 
strategy of primary interest for researchers and for society in general. 
In cryopreservation, temperatures reach below -190°C in order to 
paralyze the chemical reactions and keep the plant material viable for 
long periods. The present research focuses on the development of 
protocols for cryopreservation of seeds, aimed at the preservation of 
biodiversity, focusing on the family Orchidaceae, for the subsequent 
generation of a seed bank. The assays were performed on seeds of 
Epidendrum quitensium, Sobralia rosea, and Epidendrum anderssonii. 
Two freezing rates were tested: rapid freezing at -196°C; and step 
freezing at -22°C, -60°C to 196°C, further analyzed four combinations 
from Dimethylsulfoxide DMSO, glycerol and sucrose (DMSO 1M; 
DMSO 1M + glycerol 1M; DMSO 1M + sucrose 1M; DMSO 1M + glycerol 
0,5M + sucrose 0,5M). The best results were obtained both in rapid 
and stepped freezing without the use of cryo-protective substances, 
by introducing the seeds directly into liquid nitrogen. Species of the 
genus Epidendrum presented a more efficient response in comparison 
to Sobralia. The viability of the seeds was evaluated by the tetrazolium 
test.

Introduction
The Republic of Ecuador is located on the South American 
continent. From north to south the country is crossed by the Andes 
mountain range and has four climatic regions: Coast, Andes, Ama-
zon and the Insular region1. Its position in the middle of the world, 
the luminous intensity, the ocean currents and the different alti-
tudes produce 82 types of ecosystems (see Ministry of Environ-
ment document on ecosystems in Ecuador) There is a great variety 
of climatic regions that have an important effect in the diversifi-
cation of plant formations2. Concerning the Orchidaceae family, 
in Ecuador as of 2010, 4032 species of orchids have been iden-
tified, of which 1714 (42.5%) are endemic3; 4.5% of the orchids 
of the planet are found in Ecuador. Seed banks allow the con-
servation of the biodiversity ex situ and prioritize species used 
for food, medicine and those in danger of extinction. Orchidaceae 
is a large family with many endangered species and all of them 
are included in the Convention on International Trade in Endan-
gered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) I and II4. 
Cryopreservation is an efficient strategy to safeguard these spe-
cies, but unfortunately, orchid seeds have short lifetimes5; the 
longevity depends on the moisture content and storage tempera-
ture, so it is necessary to experiment with efficient storage systems 
for each species5. The advantages of cryopreservation are: storage 
for an indefinite period, genetic stability of the individuals, reduced 
infrastructure, can have independent energy and the stored 
genetic material does not require manipulation6.
Therefore, the objective of this research was to define protocols 
for cryopreservation of orchid seeds, in order to install a seed 
bank that promotes the conservation of vulnerable species.
Methods
Collection of biological material
The collection of plant material was made through the authori-
zation of the Ministry of Environment of Ecuador No. 17-2011- 
Investigación-B- DPMS/MAE,FloraX, N0. 08−2013−0869−I 
CFAU−F LO−DAPI −UNO−MAE and the Botanical Garden 
“Orquídeas de Sarina” patent No. 006-2015- FLO-DPAP- MA.
The cryopreservation tests were developed with the seeds of 3 
species: Epidendrum quitensium Rchb.f., Sobralia rosea Poepp. 
& Endl. and Epidendrum anderssonii Hágsater & Dodson 
(Figure 1). The cryopreservation tests were developed with 3 
species: 
•   2392 Epidendrum quitensium Rchb.f., (0° 17’52.1”N 78° 
22’33.3”W 3200 msnm)
•   2420 Sobralia rosea Poepp.& Endl. (0°52’11.8”N 78° 
26’53.8”W 600 msnm)
•   2706 Epidendrum anderssonii Hágsater&Dodson (0° 
50’36.2”N 78° 25’01.5”W 1200 msnm)
The species pertain to three different altitudes and were selected 
from many sources and have capsules with viable seeds. The 
seeds collected from the forest were stored in an absorbant paper 
bag with respective codes for the plant, after they were stored in 
a Ziplock bag with rice of 12% humidity.
Freezing speed
Two types of freezing were tested, suggested according to 
Mroginski et al7. The sample units had 0.2 g of seeds stored 
in cryo tubes (091.11.102, ˙ISOLAB, Wertheim, Germany) 
of 2 ml. Steps of freezing: freezing was carried out in the 
following sequence, 0°C for 1 hour by placing the samples in an 
refrigerator (Electrolux, Stockholm, Sweden), -22°C for 1 hour 
placing the seeds in a freezer (Selecta Templow, Barcelona, Spain), 
- 60°C for 1 hour inserting the seeds in an ultra low temperature 
freezer (New Brunswick Scientific, Edision, NJ, USA), then the 
seeds were held at 196°C by submerging the samples in liquid 
nitrogen contained in a thermal container. Finally the samples 
were placed in racks and stored in a thermal tank (STATE-
BOURNE biorack 5400, Washington, UK). Rapid freezing: 
the samples were placed directly in liquid nitrogen at 196°C 
by immersion using a procedure similar to that used in steps of 
freezing. In addition, four combinations of cryo preservatives were 
analyzed: 1- DMSO 1M (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH, USA); 
2-DMSO 1M (Fisher) – glycerol 1M; 3- DMSO 1M (Fisher) – 
sucrose 1M; 4- DMSO 1M (Fisher) – glycerol 0.5M – sucrose 0.5M 
(Fisher) (Table 1).

Seed viability
Seed viability was tested after freezing. Briefly, 5mg of seeds 
was added to 1.5 ml of 10% sucrose solution and left at 25° C 
for 24 hours, the seeds were washed with water and 1ml of 
triphenyl tetrazolium chloride solution (TTC, 1%) (Sigma-
Aldrich, St Louis, MI, USA) was added, and then incubated 
at 40° C for 24 hours. Finally, the seeds were washed with 
sterilised water and observed under the microscope with a 4x lens 
(MC100Led, MI-CROS, St. Veit/Glan, Austria). The process for 
calculating the TTC method was carried out as follows: -Observe 
the seeds in microscope using lense 4X. -Identify viable seeds 
and non viable seeds. -Use cross multiplication to determine the 
average of viability of all seeds.
Statistical analysis
The experimental design 2x5 with three repetitions was applied 
to analyse the freezing methods (Table 2). The results were 
analyzed by unidirectional ANOVA with 95% confidence. To 
determine the best treatments the Duncan test was used. This 
analysis was carried out with RStudio 3.1 (package: Agricolae).
Results
The seeds were considered viable when red coloration of the 
embryo was observed8 (Figure 2).
According to the data obtained (Table 3, Figure 3), there is a 
significant difference in the results when comparing the data 
between the species and between the treatments. According to 
the Duncan test, the best treatments were rapid freezing and step 
freezing without the use of cryopreservatives. The least effi-
cient treatment was step freezing with the use of DMSO as a 
cryopreservant (Table 4). The species Epidendrum quitensium 
and Epidendrum anderssonii showed better results (Figure 4).

Discussion
Currently, cryopreservation is a safe and cost-effective option for 
the conservation of endangered species9. In the present investi-
gation, a protocol was developed for cryopreservation of orchid 
seeds that provides a high percentage of viability, is easy to apply 
and economical. The seeds of orchids frozen at -196°C can be 
kept alive with a moisture content of 12% and do not require 
cryo-protective substances, confirming what is described by 
Iriondo et al. and others10,11. The use of cryopreservatives is 
recommended for seeds with a high moisture content, as stated 
by Reed and others12–14. Furthermore, Harding15 states that it is 
necessary to demonstrate the genetic stability of plants regener-
ated from cryopreserved plant material to approve their release 
and reintroduction into the environment; but to date, there have 
been no reports showing changes at the phenotypic, biochemical, 
chromosomal or molecular levels attributed to storage systems 
by cryoconservation14. The cryoconservation method that gave the 
best results was the “Rapid” freezing  without the addition of any 
cryopreservative substance.

In the paper entitled "Cryopreservation of orchid seeds through rapid and step freezing methods" 
written by Marco Cerna et al. two types of freezing technique were tested by the seeds of 3 
species: 
Epidendrum quitensium Rchb.f., Sobralia rosea Poepp. & Endl. and Epidendrum anderssonii Hágsater & 
Dodson. 
 
The authors present step freezing and rapid freezing methods for cryopreservation purposes. 
There was a significant difference in the results  between the species and between the treatments. 
The cryoconservation method that provided the best results was the "Rapid" freezing, without the 
addition of any substance. 
  
The introduction is well structured, helping the readers to understand the issue the method tries 
to solve. Considering that it is a research note the methodology is very detailed. 
  
Nevertheless, in my opinion it is important to highlight the viability of the developed method on a 
wider spectrum if possible. In the current form of the Discussion, only general statements can be 
found regarding the viability of the developed method. 
 
A more concrete concluding sentence is missing that could answer the following question: 
 
For what kind of other plants, could this method be useful? 
 
If the developed method can be applied "only" for orchid seeds, a concluding sentence should be 
placed in the Discussion, stating the limiting factors (in terms of species) of the method. Although 
in this study only 3 species were examined, I believe that its important to inform the readers about 
the authors' recommendation regarding the potential usefulness in other species.

The authors described a protocol for cryopreservation of seeds of three tropical orchids in liquid 
nitrogen (LN). They tested rapid and progressive cooling with the controlled temperature at 0°C, -
22°C, -60°C and -196°C. They also included the application of three different cryoprotectants such 
as DMSO, glycerol and sucrose. The viability of tested seeds was checked using tetrazolim test. 
The protocol might have potential for the cryopreservation of  these orchids. However, the 
manuscript cannot be accepted to publish at present and need major revision for the following 
main reasons:.
Abstract: Authors could not bring the conclusion ‘Species of the genus Epidendrum 
presented a more efficient response in comparison to Sobralia.’, because only one species 
was be tested in the this manuscript.

sp2706 (T57.2), sp2392 (T 57.03), sp2420(T39.37), should be replaced by Latin name of 
orchids species. 
 
9. 
Discussion: The discussion should be rewritten. There were few relevant literatures of 
orchid Cryopreservation were cited in this manuscript. There have lots of related literatures 
for orchid Cryopreservation at present, which should be discussed and what is the 
innovation of the manuscript?

Competing Interests: No competing interests were disclosed.
I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of 
expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have

The authors describe in the presented manuscript titled “Cryopreservation of orchid seeds 
through rapid and step freezing methods” a new protocol for cryopreservation of seeds of three 
tropical orchids in liquid nitrogen (LN). They tested rapid and progressive cooling with the 
controlled temperature at 0°C, -22°C, -60°C and -196°C. They also included the application of three 
different cryoprotectants such as DMSO, glycerol and sucrose. The viability of tested seeds was 
checked using tetrazolim test. Red coloured embryos were considered as the main indicator of the 
preserved viability of the tested seeds. I suppose that this work brings a novelty to a cryoscience 
research, especially due to the geographical origin of the studied material. Neotropical 
Orchidaceae should be prioritized in various research studies for their ecological vulnerability 
and/or a shortage of knowledge. Especially, the research achievements from such country as 
Ecuador (the orchid biodiversity hotspot), are important for science. However, numerous 
modifications and a deep correction of the text should be accomplished.
English correction is strongly recommended throughout the whole text. There are many 
errors in English grammar in the current form of the manuscript, which cause huge 
difficulties in text reading.
1. 
Abstract: The authors should be focused on the topic of cryopreservation. The first two

sentences in the abstract are out of topic. Moreover, the number of the orchid species 
(provided number 4032) is not correct. The authors should consider to check the work of D. 
Neill published in 2015 (¿Cuantas especies nativas de plantas vasculares hay en Ecuador?; 
Revista Amazónica Ciencia y Tecnología) and Cataloque of the Vascular Plants of Ecuador 
available on www.tropicos.org, for example.
Abstract, sentence “In cryopreservation, temperatures reach below -190°C” should be 
rephrased because the cryostorage is a long-lasting preserving of studied material at 
temperature of -80°C, -130°C upto -196°C, which is the temperature of the liquid nitrogen.
3. 
Abstract, the authors should rephrase the sentence “The present research focuses on……” 
because of repetition of the verb to focus. Instead of “…for a subsequent generation of a 
seed bank” to use “for future seed collection” for example.
4. 
Abstract, “the use of cryo-protective substances”, better to use the term „cryoprotectants“.
5. 
Introduction; The first half of the abstract is out of the topic of cryopreservation. The 
authors should be focused on this topic. Moreover, the authors should provide much more 
citations regarding this topic and discuss shortly the history of cryopreservation of seeds 
with more interest in orchid seeds. There are many available papers regarding this topic.
6. 
Methods; The first paragraph should be included in “Acknowledgement” at the end of the 
paper, not in methods. However, each part of the Methods should be provided with a 
number, e.g. 1. 1 Collection of the seed material. The sentence “The cryopreservation test 
were developed with 3 species” is repetition of the first sentence of this paragraph.
7. 
The authors should use "a.s.l."as the abbreviation for above sea level; the provided 
abbreviation "msnm" is not understandable. The part of the sentence” The species pertain 
to three different altitudes….. „ is a repetition of the information written before. Authors 
write “…..were selected from many sources“, what does it mean? The authors should 
provide more detailed information about the sources. Then, the part of the sentence …“and 
have capsules with viable seeds” does not bring the clear information. Were the capsules 
opened during collection or not? When did the authors collect the seeds (the date)?
8. 
Methods; Freezing speed. Better to rewrite the title, e.g. Cryopreservation of the seeds
9. 
This part should be shorten. Besides, the citation of the first sentence Mroginski et al. does 
not correspond with the number 7. Totally different citation is written under this number. 
The authors should check the citations of provided literature in the text. Moreover, the 
authors should provide the information about duration of cryostorage. This very important 
information is missing.
10. 
In the paragraph “Freezing speed” the authors provide information about placing the tested 
orchid seeds under the temperature 0°C in a refrigerator. However, this fact is not written in 
the abstract.
11. 
The authors should eliminate “…., contained in a thermal container”.
12. 
The sentence “Finally the samples were places in racks and store in thermal tansk……” 
should be eliminated, because it is not understandable.
13. 
Freezing speed; In addition,….should be eliminated because the application of 
cryoprotectants is one of the main objectives of this research paper. It is not something 
additional.
14. 
Why did the authors not test application of sucrose and glycerol individually?
15. 
The authors should clearly demonstrate, which treatment is considered as a control.
16. 
Table 1 should be deleted, because all the information given in this table is written in the 
text.
17. 
Figure 1; Title should be improved, e.g. “Orchid species used in this study”.
18.

The paragraph of “Seed viability” should be eliminated. Instead just one sentence with a 
citation of the work, where this method was used as first, should be placed at the end of the 
previous paragraph.
19. 
Statistical analysis; The authors should explain better of the meaning “The experimental 
design 2x5”. It is not clear from the written text.
20. 
Results; The sentence “The seeds were considered viable when red…..” is actually the part of 
Material and methods.
21. 
Results; this part should be re-written. The information should be provided more clearly.
22. 
Table 3; What is CI? Better to use term “Gradual” instead of “step”. The abbreviations of each 
treatment are already provided in Material and Methods.
23. 
Figure 3; Authors should provide information about the meaning of “E” (in e.g. ED, EDG) and 
“R” (in e.g. RD, RDG).
24. 
Figure 4; Authors should provide information about the meaning of sp2392, sp2420 and 
sp2706.  It is not clear.
25. 
Discussion; First, the obtained main result should be provided and discussed with much 
more available literature. Especially, the authors should compare their findings with 
achievements in other studies. The provided references are very limited. The works dealing 
with cryostorage of seeds of other plant families should be included. The given number of 
cited paper in discussion does not correspond to the number provided in the References.
26. 
 
Competing Interests: No competing interests were disclosed.
Reviewer Expertise: Isolation, molecular determination and cryopreservation of orchid mycorrhiza 
fungi and associated bacteria. Experienced with orchid seed banking techniques.
I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of 
expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have 
significant reservations, as outlined above.
