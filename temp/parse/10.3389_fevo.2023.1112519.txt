Climate change and erosion from agricultural areas cause increased drying periods 
and bedform migration of riverbeds, respectively, worldwide. Both sediment 
drying and bedform migration can independently stress the microbial community 
residing in the riverbed. Here, we  investigated the microbial response after 
exposure to these stressors with a focus on long-term recovery. We conducted 
an in situ experiment to investigate the long-term (8 months) functional and 
structural recovery of benthic microbial communities from either sediment drying 
(episodic severe stressor) or bedform migration (frequent moderate stressor). 
Stressed sediment associated communities were rewetted (dried sediments) and 
immobilized (migrated sediments) and exposed in the River Spree (north-eastern 
Germany) to initiate the recovery process. We then evaluated the microbial function 
(community respiration, net community production and extracellular enzymatic 
activities) as well as the bacterial, fungal and diatom community structure (16S 
rRNA gene and ITS region metabarcoding, and microscopic diatom morphotype 
classification). We observed different recovery times for community respiration 
(less than 7 days) and gross primary production (more than 5 months), implying a 
shift toward net heterotrophy in the first few months after stress exposure. Similarly, 
we observed a strong autotrophic community response (particularly associated 
with the diatoms Navicula and Fragilaria), especially in migrated sediments. The 
bacterial and fungal community response to sediment drying was stronger than 
to bedform migration (particularly associated with the bacterium Flavobacterium 
and the fungi Alternaria sp. and Aureobasidium pullulans). Our results show that 
sediment drying and bedform migration had a significant impact on the microbial 
community function and structure, which persisted for several months after the 
stress. Due to the surprising long period of recovery, successive stress events 
combined with seasonal effects will likely hamper the ongoing recovery process 
with severe alterations to the microbial function and structure. These findings 
extend the concept of ecosystem resilience and stability on the dimensions of 
timescale and seasonal environmental variations. Legacy effects are expected to 
play a key role when facing future stress.

Introduction
Lotic ecosystems have been recognized as important drivers of the 
global carbon cycle (Cole et al., 2007; Aufdenkampe et al., 2011; 
Raymond et  al., 2013) and maintenance of regional biodiversity 
(Naiman et  al., 1993; Dudgeon et  al., 2006; Meyer et  al., 2007). 
However, the integrity and functioning of important biogeochemical 
processes and ecosystem services are regularly challenged by the 
exposure to stressors (Elosegi et al., 2010; Smeti et al., 2019). A stressor, 
either natural or anthropogenic, is any factor that alters steady-state 
environmental conditions (abiotic or biotic) and influences the growth 
or mortality of organisms in a community (Rocca et  al., 2019). 
Microbial communities colonizing the riverbed have gained wide 
acceptance as sensitive indicators of environmental change in recent 
years (Burns and Ryder, 2001; Feio et al., 2010; Lau et al., 2015) as they 
contribute substantially to the biogeochemical cycling of organic 
matter and nutrients (Besemer, 2015; Battin et al., 2016; Leff et al., 
2016). Hence, impacts of stress on lotic ecosystems are often paralleled 
by changes in microbial community structure and benthic metabolism, 
which are both viable features for ecosystem functioning (Battin et al., 
2003; Bell et al., 2005). In the case where the microbial community 
structure is heavily altered by a stress, metabolism may still 
be unaffected due to functional redundancy, which describes that 
different species perform similar ecological functions and, therefore, 
ensure stable ecosystem functioning despite species loss (Lawton and 
Brown, 1993; Loreau, 2004; Wohl et al., 2004). The response of a 
microbial community to stress can be described by resistance and 
resilience, two important drivers of community stability (Allison and 
Martiny, 2008; Shade et al., 2012; Rocca et al., 2019; Pelletier et al., 
2020). Resistance is the ability to withstand functional and structural 
changes during stress exposure (Pimm, 1984; Allison and Martiny, 
2008). Resilience is the capacity to return to the original state of 
activity and community structure when the exposure to stress has 
ended (Holling, 1973). Community recovery describes the return of a 
system to either its pre-disturbance state or a comparable control 
(Power, 1998; Shade et al., 2012; Sorensen and Shade, 2020).
Some of the most harmful stresses for benthic microbial 
communities are the absence of water as well as increased radiation 
and temperature during drought periods. Sediment drying becomes 
increasingly frequent in temperate perennial streams as a consequence 
of climate change (Vörösmarty et al., 2000; Döll and Schmied, 2012; 
Wanders and Van Lanen, 2015). Microbial communities of perennial 
streams show a reduced resistance toward water scarcity compared to 
those of temporary streams (Timoner et al., 2020). Ample evidence 
manifests the high potential of drying periods to alter biogeochemical 
cycling (Vázquez et al., 2015; Sabater et al., 2016; Colls et al., 2019), 
microbial community composition and abundance (Febria et al., 2012; 
Fazi et al., 2013; Gionchetta et al., 2020), trophic interactions (Ledger 
et al., 2013; Oprei et al., 2019) and gas fluxes to the atmosphere 
(Gómez-Gener et al., 2016; Muñoz et al., 2018; Bolpagni et al., 2019). 
Flow resumption after drought entails the activation of dormant 
microbes and the leaching of carbon and nutrients that accumulated 
during the preceding drying phase (Larned et al., 2010; Romaní et al., 
2017; von Schiller et al., 2017), fuelling microbial activity during the 
first biogeochemical response.
Another common phenomenon in temperate streams is the 
accumulation of sandy sediments that dominate the riverbed of lowland 
rivers. Rivers draining agricultural areas are vulnerable to increased 
input of sandy sediments as a result of catchment erosion (Matthaei 
et al., 2006; Belmont et al., 2011; Wilkes et al., 2019). These sandy 
riverbeds are mobile and form migrating bedforms, such as sand 
ripples, at flow velocities of <0.2 to 0.6 m s−1 (Langlois and Valance, 2007; 
Charru et al., 2013). Bedform migration alters the hyporheic exchange 
of solutes and fines (Packman and Brooks, 2001; Harvey et al., 2012; 
Zheng et al., 2019) and impacts oxygen fluxes in and underneath the 
bedform (Rutherford et al., 1993; Ahmerkamp et al., 2015; Wolke et al., 
2020). Migrating bedforms negatively affect community respiration 
(Zlatanović et  al., 2017; Scheidweiler et  al., 2021) and primary 
production (Uehlinger et al., 2002; Marcarelli et al., 2015; Scheidweiler 
et al., 2021) in comparison to sediments that are immobile (stationary), 
providing reasons to see bedform migration as a moderate stress.
The impacts of stress on aquatic ecosystems, for example, severe 
drought, have been noted to persist long after conditions have 
returned to normal (Rees et al., 2006; Calapez et al., 2014; Truchy 
et al., 2020). However, many experimental studies evaluated only 
short-term responses after drying in the scale of days (McKew et al., 
2011; Oprei et al., 2019) to weeks (Pohlon et al., 2013; Gionchetta 
et al., 2019; Truchy et al., 2020) and after bedform migration in the 
scale of days (Scheidweiler et al., 2021), ignoring potential lagged 
stress effects at longer temporal scales.
Microbiological processes range in the scale of several hours to a 
few days (Song et al., 2014; Wieder et al., 2015) and are quickly restored 
at the community level due to functional redundancy (Comte et al., 
2013; Woodward et al., 2015; Louca et al., 2018), while structural 
responses lag behind (Berga et al., 2012). Since the response to stress is 
not monotonous, and includes decoupling of functional and structural 
recovery, extrapolating short-term responses is likely to be erroneous 
(Berga et al., 2012; König et al., 2017). This further highlights the 
necessity of monitoring the recovery on a long-term scale (Niemi et al., 
1990; Berga et al., 2012). Despite numerous studies on multiple stressor 
effects in aquatic ecosystems (e.g., Nõges et al., 2016; Romero et al., 
2018; Cabrerizo et al., 2019), direct comparisons between the recovery 
paths from different stresses under comparable environmental 
conditions are scarce. It is known that the recovery path of the 
microbial community is shaped by the previous stress type (König 
et al., 2017) as well as its strength and frequency (Berga et al., 2012).
Studies on soil suggest that microbial communities with a history 
of stress have the ability to adapt their response to future stress and 
increase their resistance and resilience (Evans and Wallenstein, 2012; 
van Kruistum et al., 2018). Unlike in Mediterranean streams where 
riverbed biofilms experience a history of periodic drying through 
seasonal droughts, drying in most temperate rivers is episodic and a

rather rare stress despite ongoing hydrological shifts under climate 
change. On the contrary, bedform migration in sandy lowland streams 
can be addressed as a frequent stress, since shifting between stationary 
patches of sands and migrating bedforms is caused regularly by 
fluctuations in discharge and bed patch dynamics (migration history; 
Zlatanović et al., 2017; Scheidweiler et al., 2021).
Our field experiment in a sand bed river aimed to assess the 
functional and structural recovery of benthic microbial communities 
that had been exposed to one of two types of stress: (i) drying or 
(ii) bedform migration. In lowland steams, these stressors can occur 
at distinct points in time, but sometimes also in spatial and temporal 
proximity. The recovery paths of the sediment microbial communities 
were investigated for 8 months after they were rewetted and deposited 
at rest on the riverbed. We intended to cover the transition of short- to 
mid-term (days to 1–2 weeks) to long-term recovery (weeks to 
months). Microbial communities from permanently wet and 
stationary riverbed sediments served as a control. We hypothesized 
that (1) microbial communities recover functionally and structurally 
from previous stresses in the long term irrespective of the stressor 
type. Furthermore, based on the assumption of functional redundancy, 
(2) functional recovery is faster than structural recovery, independent 
of the stressor type. Linked to the role of stress intensity on the 
recovery, we further expected that (3) communities that have been 
exposed to drying (episodic and severe stress) show slower functional 
and structural recovery compared to communities that have been 
exposed to bedform migration (periodic and moderate stress).
Materials and methods
Study site
The experiment was performed in the third order sand bed 
lowland River Spree approximately 10 km north of Cottbus (north-
eastern Germany, UTM coordinates 51°50′N and 14°20′E). The area 
is characterized by a temperate continental climate with a yearly 
precipitation of 568 mm [DWD Climate Data Center (CDC), 2020]. 
Riparian vegetation is dominated by scattered willow (Salix spp.) and 
alder (Alnus glutinosa) trees. The experimental reach is approximately 
100 m long. Discharge has a long-term (1979–2020) annual mean of 
15.4 m3 s−1 and varies between 8.2  m3s−1 (mean low flow) and 
39.8 m3 s−1 (mean high flow) at the nearest gauge in Cottbus (see 
Supplementary Figure S1 for a hydrograph between January 2018–
June 2019). The River Spree is categorized as rarely intermittent (sensu 
Datry et al., 2017). An extraordinarily severe and long drought period 
in autumn and winter 2018 had decreased the discharge to <5 m3s−1, 
exposing large parts of the riverbed to drying. The riverbed is 
composed of grain sizes in the range of sand (D50: 0.65 mm, D10: 
0.30 mm, D85: 1.6 mm). At base flow, more than half of the riverbed in 
the study reach was covered by migrating ripples. The migration 
velocity of these bedforms ranged at 6–69 cm h−1 with a median of 
38.6 cm h−1 at mean low flow.
Experimental design
We performed a field experiment by comparing the function and 
structure of benthic microbial communities that recovered from either 
drying (hereafter dried) or bedform migration (hereafter migrated) to 
a control, which was submerged and immobile (hereafter control). To 
prepare the dried sediment, we  sampled fully submerged and 
immobile (hereafter stationary) sandy sediment from the top 10 cm of 
the riverbed in June 2018 (Supplementary Figures S2A,B). The 
sediment was dried for 90 days under an outdoor translucent rooftop, 
exposed to natural sunlight radiation and temperature changes 
without shading and excluding precipitation (for details of the drying 
process see Schreckinger et al., 2021). Migrated and control sediments 
were sampled from the crest (≤1 cm) of migrating bedform and 
stationary sediment patches, respectively, at base flow in October 2018 
(Supplementary Figure S2C). All three sediment types (dried, 
migrated, control) were sieved (<2 mm) before approximately 200 mL 
of each sediment type were transferred into 20 × 26 cm mesh bags 
(250 μm mesh size; Supplementary Figure S2D). The mesh bags (four 
replicates per sediment type) were fixed to a rope with roughly 20 cm 
distance between adjacent bags (Supplementary Figure S2E). This was 
repeated seven times for the subsequent sampling times (seven ropes 
with 12 mesh bags each from three sediment types) and all mesh bags 
were placed on the riverbed by fixing the ropes with steel pegs 
(Supplementary Figure S2F).
The field experiment started when we exposed the mesh bags in 
the river, rewetting the dried sediment and immobilizing the formerly 
migrating sediments. We started the recovery of dried and migrated 
sediments in late autumn (22 October 2018) as drying naturally 
occurs during the summer months, therefore, inevitably designating 
autumn/winter as the primary starting point for microbial recovery. 
One set of sediment samples was not immersed in the river but 
analyzed on the same day and served as initial characterization (day 
0). The sediment exposed to the river was further retrieved after 4, 7, 
21, 42, 105, 161, and 224 days (Supplementary Figure S2G). At each 
sampling date, we  additionally sampled submerged, stationary 
sediment (i.e., not in mesh bags) next to the exposed bags to account 
for possible mesh bag effects and seasonal dynamics (hereafter in situ). 
All samples were stored cool and dark during the transport to the 
laboratory (<2 h). Subsamples for community respiration (CR) and 
net community production (NCP) were analyzed immediately. 
Subsamples for potential extracellular enzyme activities (EEA), 
bacterial and fungal community structure analyses, and autotrophic 
biomass (Chlorophyll a: Chl a) were stored at −20°C until further 
processing. Subsamples for characterizing the autotrophic 
(cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae) community structure were fixed 
with Lugol (10% final concentration).
Environmental parameters
The water temperature in the river was monitored continuously 
with HOBO data loggers (HOBO Pendant® Temperature/Light 64 K 
Data Logger and HOBO Water Temperature Pro v2 Data Logger, 
Onset Computer Corporation, Massachusetts, United States). Daily 
discharge was retrieved from the gauge in Cottbus (Landesamt für 
Umwelt Brandenburg). Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was 
measured from three replicates of filtered river water (0.45 μm, 
Sartorius) using high-temperature combustion (DIMATOC 2000, 
Dimatec Analysentechnik GmbH, Essen, Germany). Nitrate (NO3-N), 
nitrite (NO2-N), ammonium (NH4-N) and soluble reactive 
phosphorous (SRP) were photometrically determined in triplicate 
Oprei et al.

(0.2 μm filtered river water, Sartorius) using the segmented flow 
analyzer (DIN EN ISO 13395-D28, 1996; DIN EN ISO 11732-E23, 
2005; DIN EN ISO 15681 Part 2-D46, 2005; respectively). All samples 
were stored at 4°C in the dark until analyzing them 1 day after 
sampling.
Community respiration and net community 
production
At each sampling day, about 18 mL of sediment (46 g DW) were 
transferred from each mesh bag into microcosms (30 mL glass 
syringes, FORTUNA OPTIMA, Poulten & Graf GmbH, Wertheim, 
Germany). The microcosms were filled with filtered (250 μm) oxygen-
saturated river water and sealed with an airtight silicone plug without 
head space. They were placed into a water bath for temperature control 
at 11°C. Peristaltic pumps (ISMATEC ISM932D, Cole-Parmer GmbH, 
Wertheim, Germany) perfused each microcosm from bottom to top 
with filtered river water (mean ± standard deviation of all sampling 
dates: DOC: 4.21 ± 0.27 mg C L−1, DIN: 1.83 ± 0.66 mg N L−1, SRP: 
10.48 ± 7.02 μg P L−1) at 0.5 ml min−1 (24–27 min perfusion time). The 
microcosms were exposed to dark (14 ± 2 h) and light periods [10 ± 3 h, 
LED strips (SolarStringer SunStrip, daylight, Econlux, Cologne, 
Germany)] for 72 h, mirroring the current season-dependent duration 
of daylight in the field. Dissolved oxygen (DO) in the water was 
measured through valves at the inlet and outlet of the perfusing water 
of each microcosm with a needle-type oxygen microsensor (NTH-
PSt1, Precision Sensing GmbH, Regensburg, Germany; accuracy: 
± 0.4% at 20.2% O2). The latter had been calibrated with a two-point 
calibration (oxygen-free and oxygen-saturated water) before use. The 
difference in DO before and after sediment perfusion was taken as a 
proxy for CR in dark and for NCP in light. The gross primary 
production (GPP) was obtained by subtracting CR from every NCP 
measurement (individually for each microcosm), according to the 
light and dark bottle method (Gaarder and Gran, 1927). CR and GPP 
rates (μg O2 h−1 g DW−1) were related to the dry weight (DW) of the 
sediment and residence time of the sediment pore water in the 
microcosm, and standardized to 20°C using the temperature 
normalization by Winkler et al. (1996) with a Q10 factor of 2.
Potential extracellular enzyme activities
Potential EEA were assayed for β-glucosidase (BG), β-xylosidase 
(BX), alkaline phosphatase (AP), chitinase (NAG), leucine 
aminopeptidase (LAP), phenol oxidase (PO), and phenol peroxidase 
(PP), in order to capture the major metabolic pathways in aerobic 
sediments that include carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous (Frossard 
et al., 2012). Each of the enzyme activities was measured at three 
specific sampling dates (0, 21, and 105 days of recovery) and three 
replicates per sediment type were prepared by adding 2 g DW of 
sediment to 60 ml of buffer solution (0.1 M trishydroxyaminomethane, 
pH 7–9) in an autoclaved glass beaker. The slurry solution was agitated 
with a magnetic stirrer for 30 s. Four technical replicates of each 
sample slurry (200 μL) were pipetted into a black (for BG, BX, AP, 
NAG, and LAP assays) or transparent microplate well (for PO and PP 
assays). Subsequently, 50 μL of substrate analog solution (200 μM) was 
added. We used 4-methylumbelliferone (MUB; for the BG, BX, NAG 
and AP assays) and 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC; for the LAP 
assay) as fluorescent molecules linked to substrates, and 
dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) for the PO and PP assays. An 
amount of 10 μL of 0.3% H2O2 was added to the well of the PP assays.
We filled extra wells with sample slurry without substrate for 
sample control and substrate without sample slurry to correct for 
variations in fluorescence and absorbance. Quenching was assessed 
and corrected for by calculating the ratio of fluorescence of each 
sample spiked with a fluorescent standard (MUB or AMC) and the 
respective standard with a buffer solution. The following incubation 
period (1.5 h) was conducted at 11°C, under constant darkness and 
mild stirring. An amount of 10 μL NaOH 0.5 N was added at the end 
of the incubation to terminate the reaction. The fluorescence and 
absorbance were measured with an Infinite 200 fluorometer (Tecan, 
Männedorf, Switzerland) at excitation/emission wavelengths of 
365/445 nm for BG, BX, AP and NAG, 365/450 nm for LAP, and 
365/460 nm for PO and PP, respectively. The potential EEA were 
calculated as μmol h−1 mL−1 and also standardized to 20°C (Q10 factor 
of 2; Winkler et al., 1996). We used CR, GPP and EEA measurements 
to reflect the microbial community function as suggested by a sound 
body of literature (e.g., Cardinale et al., 2002; Young and Collier, 2009; 
Freimann et al., 2013; Gionchetta et al., 2019; Baattrup-Pedersen 
et al., 2020).
Bacterial and fungal community analysis
Bacterial and fungal community structure was assessed by 
amplicon sequencing on three replicates per treatment at 0, 21, and 
105 days of recovery. The DNA was extracted from about 0.5 g DW of 
each sediment sample with DNeasy Powersoil kits (Qiagen, Hilden, 
Germany) and quantified with the PicoGreen dsDNA quantification 
kit (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, United States). We targeted and 
amplified the 16S rRNAV3-V4 genomic region (Bacteria) using primer 
pairs 341Fh/806R and the ITS2 region (Fungi) using primer pairs 
ITS3/ITS4 (Perez-Mon et  al., 2020). The reaction mix for the 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was created by mixing 10 ng of DNA 
extract with GoTaq® Flexi Buffer 5x (5 μL), MgCl2 25 mM (2.5 μL), 
forward and reverse primer 100 μM (each 0.2 μL), dNTP  10 mM 
(0.5 μL), BSA 30 mg mL−1 (0.5 μL), Hot start Taq 5 U μL−1 (0.25 μL) and 
ddH20 (8.4 μL). The PCR was initiated for 2 min at 95°C, followed by 
36 (Bacteria) or 38 (Fungi) amplification cycles, and concluded with 
a final elongation stage for 10 min at 72°C. Each amplification cycle 
included denaturation of the extract for 40 s at 94°C, annealing of the 
primer for 40 s at 58°C, and elongation for 1 min at 72°C. The PCRs 
were run three times and pooled afterwards. Amplicons were sent to 
the Génome Québec Innovation Center at McGill University 
(Montréal, Canada) where they were purified, quantified, barcoded 
and paired-end sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq v3 platform 
(Illumina Inc., San Diego, Ca, United States).
A customized pipeline implemented in USEARCH (Edgar et al., 
2011) processed the bacterial and fungal sequence reads including a 
quality control and filtering (Frey et al., 2016; Perez-Mon et al., 2020). 
Paired-end reads were matched with USEARCH (Edgar and Flyvbjerg, 
2015), substitution errors were corrected using BayesHammer 
(Nikolenko et al., 2013), and PCR primers were detected and trimmed 
using Cutadapt (Martin, 2011), allowing for 1 mismatch and read 
lengths >300 bp (16S rRNA) and >200 bp (ITS). Sequences were then

dereplicated and removed from singletons. Subsequently, operational 
taxonomic units (OTUs) were clustered using a threshold of 97% 
identity with an “on-the-fly” chimera detection algorithm (Edgar, 
2013). A Bayesian classifier with 60% as the minimal bootstrap 
support implemented in MOTHUR (Schloss et al., 2009) was used 
prior to querying 16S rRNA (Bacteria) and ITS reads (Fungi) against 
the SILVA v.138.1 (Quast et al., 2013) and UNITE v.8.2 (Kõljalg et al., 
2020) reference databases, respectively, to provide the final 
taxonomical classification of the OTUs detected. We recovered a total 
of 1,025,452 prokaryotic reads clustered into 5,066 OTUs and 717,020 
fungal reads clustered into 1,976 OTUs.
The bacterial and fungal abundance was quantified for three 
replicates per treatment at 0, 21 and 105 days of recovery using 
quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) of the bacterial 16S rRNAV3-V4 
genomic region (using primer pairs 27F/519r) and fungal ITS2 region 
(using primer pairs ITS3/ITS4). An amount of 6.6 μL of diluted DNA 
from the extraction was added to 7.5 μL of SYBR™ Green PCR master 
mix solution, 0.5 μL of HPLC Water, 0.1 μL of BSA, and 0.15 μL of each 
primer (the same primers as for the amplicon sequencing without the 
barcodes). An amount of 15 μL of DNA master mix solution was 
added to an ABI7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied 
Biosystems, Foster City, United States). The qPCR was initiated at 
95°C for 15 min, followed by 40 amplification cycles (each at 95°C for 
30 s, 90°C for 45 s and 72°C for 45 s) and a subsequent melting curve 
(at 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 60 s and 95°C for 15 s). The standard curves 
(three for each targeted region) were obtained from a tenfold serial 
dilution (10−1 to 10−9 copies) of plasmids generated from cloned 
targets. The bacterial and fungal abundance as the number of cell 
copies was related to the total DNA in the sample (ng μL−1) and the 
DW of the sample (g DW) to obtain cells g DW−1.
Autotrophic community analysis
The community structure of the photoautotrophic organisms 
(hereafter referred to as autotrophic) was determined in three replicates 
per treatment at 0, 21 and 161 days of recovery. Autotrophs were 
extracted from the sediments (13.4 ± 6.6 g DW) following the protocol 
of Mendoza-Lera et al. (2017). In short, after adding 30 mL deionized 
water, each sample was vortexed at a maximum velocity for 1 min 
(Janke and Kunkel, Germany) and sonicated at a low intensity for 5 min 
(Bandelin Sonorex, Germany). A subsample of 100 μL or 200 μL of the 
supernatant, depending on the concentration of autotrophs and 
particles, was placed in an Utermöhl chamber (∅ = 25.8 ± 0.19 mm, 
Hydrobios, Germany), stained with the same volume of Bengalrosa 
and left to settle overnight before counting the living diatoms (cells or 
frustules with chloroplasts), empty diatoms (cells or frustules without 
any chloroplast), chlorophytes and cyanobacteria. Approximately 400 
living cells were enumerated at a magnification of 400x using an inverse 
light microscope (Axioskop2, Zeiss, Germany). Living diatoms and 
cyanobacteria were grouped by morphotype (Streble and Krauter, 
1988; Cox, 1996; von Berg et al., 2012) using their morphology and 
length (according to the longest axis). The abundance of each 
morphotype is related to the DW of the sediment (cells g DW−1) in the 
sample. The autotrophic community was composed of living diatoms 
(50.8%), empty diatom frustules (47.6%) and cyanobacteria (1.9%; 
values are mean over all replicates, sediment types and sampling dates, 
n = 27). Chlorophytes were not observed in any sample. Trends found 
between sediment types during recovery were mainly driven by living 
diatoms due to the low abundance of cyanobacteria. Therefore, 
we focused our analysis on the community structure of living diatom 
morphotypes. The total diatom abundance was calculated as the sum 
of living diatom cells of each morphotype per sample.
We used Chl a as a measure of autotrophic biomass. Chl a was 
extracted from wet sediments (1.8 ± 0.5 g DW for days 0 to 42, or 
13.6 ± 3.7 g DW for days 105 to 224) with 90% ethanol followed by 
several cycles of freezing and thawing. After extraction, the Chl a 
concentration 
was 
measured 
by 
high-performance 
liquid 
chromatography 
(Ultimate3000, 
Thermo 
Fisher 
Scientific 
Corporation, Waltham, MA, United States) and related to the DW of 
each sample (Scheidweiler et al., 2021).
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed in the R statistical 
environment (version 4.1.1, R Core Team, 2021) and considered 
significant at p < 0.05. We tested the interaction of sediment type 
(dried, migrated, control) and sampling day (0, 4, 7, 21, 42, 105, 161, 
224 days) in separate linear models on each response variable (CR, 
GPP, EEA, Chl a and abundance: diatom cells, 16S and ITS gene 
copies) via two-way permutation tests (permANOVA, 9,999 
permutations) using the aovp function of the package lmPerm 
(Wheeler and Torchiano, 2016). Pairwise comparisons between 
sediment types were implemented for each sampling day as post hoc 
tests by calculating estimated marginal means using the emmeans 
function of the package emmeans (Lenth et al., 2023).
We ran a non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) based on 
a Bray-Curtis distance matrix created by the function metaMDS in the 
vegan package (Oksanen et  al., 2022) to assess the community 
structure (β-diversity) of bacteria, fungi and diatoms and fitted 
functional parameters (CR, GPP, EEA) as gradients via the envfit 
function (vegan package, Oksanen et  al., 2022) to the 
NMDS. We  performed permutational multivariate analyses of 
variance 
(PERMANOVA, 
9,999 
permutations, 
Bray–Curtis 
dissimilarity) separately for each sampling day using the function 
adonis (vegan package, Oksanen et al., 2022). Mantel tests (9,999 
permutations, Spearman correlations) were performed using the 
function mantel in vegan (Oksanen et al., 2022) in order to test for 
correlations between community function (Euclidean distances, 
including CR, GPP and EEA) and structure (Bray Curtis distances) on 
each sampling day. All data were scaled to values between zero and 
one before the analyses.
We also calculated principal response curves (PRC) sensu van Den 
Brink and Ter Braak (1999) to assess the community response to the 
effect of the stress (dried and migrated) relative to the control at each 
specific time point. This has the advantage of partialling out the effect 
of a changing control over time due to seasonal effects. Instead, a basic 
response pattern of the entire community is modeled for each 
sediment type and displayed by a response score (y-axis). The response 
scores are based on the first axis of a distance-based redundancy 
analysis (Bray-Curtis distance) and were calculated by the function 
capscale (package vegan; Oksanen et al., 2022), with the sediment type 
as the explanatory variable and recovery time as a covariable. As the 
control is set to zero, deviations of the x-axis can be seen as a sediment-
type-related community response. Secondly, species weights display

taxon-specific affinity to the overall community response, meaning 
that species with high positive or negative weights correspond most 
to the response of the respective sediment type. Small or zero species 
scores indicate that the individual species reaction differs from the 
community response (but does not exclude a general response to the 
sediment type, see van Den Brink and Ter Braak, 1999). Additionally, 
the sign of the species weights determines the direction (an increase 
or decrease in abundance) of the species depending on the sign of the 
community response. The proportional change in abundance (relative 
to the control) at a specific time point can be  calculated by exp 
(sediment type score * species weight). The fitness of the PRC was 
tested by an analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the first axis [bacteria: 
F(1,18) = 18.77, p < 0.001; fungi: F(1,18) = 13.66, p = 0.001, diatoms: 
F(1,18) = 7.73, p = 0.011], following Graeber et al. (2017), showing that 
all PRCs significantly explained the data.
Results
Environmental parameters
DOC in the river water varied between 3.65 and 4.87 mg L−1 and 
dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN: sum of NO3-N, NO2-N and 
NH4-N) ranged between 0.92 and 2.95 mg L−1 with no seasonal trend 
(Supplementary Table S1). SRP was highest in the winter (up to 
21.3 ± 0.6 μg L−1 in December at day 42) and lowest in early spring 
(3.2 ± 0.4 μg L−1 in February at day 105 and in April at day 161). The 
low SRP concentration in early spring caused the high DIN:SRP ratio 
of 264–442 during this period. The DIN:SRP ratio estimated 56 at all 
other sampling dates (Supplementary Table S1).
Community respiration and gross primary 
production
The initial mean CR for stressed sediments was 0.36 ± 0.25 μgO2 
h−1 gDW−1 (dried) and 1.46 ± 0.05 μgO2 h−1 gDW−1 (migrated) and, 
thus, significantly lower than the control (3.46 ± 0.35 μgO2 h−1 gDW−1, 
p < 0.001, Supplementary Table S2). CR was marked by a sharp 
increase within the first 3 weeks (Figure 1A). The dried sediments 
showed a steeper response to the stress relief (6.5-fold increase) than 
migrated sediments (1.5-fold increase). CR of stressed sediments was 
different from the control at day 4 (p < 0.001) and partially at day 7 
(dried: p = 0.012, migrated: p = 0.08). At day 21, both sediments had 
recovered to the level of the control (dried: p = 0.677, migrated: 
p = 0.342, Figure 1A). CR remained constant at 2.92 ± 0.81 μgO2 h−1 
gDW−1 (dried) and 3.22 ± 0.98 μgO2 h−1 gDW−1 (migrated) until day 
224, being similar to the control (3.57 ± 0.93 μgO2 h−1 gDW−1).
A fast resumption of metabolic activity could be observed for CR, 
however, the recovery of GPP from drying and migrating was much 
slower (Figure 1B). GPP started at 0.13 ± 0.17 μgO2 h−1 gDW−1 (dried) 
and 2.38 ± 0.41 μgO2 h−1 gDW−1 (migrated) compared to 6.29 ± 0.64 
μgO2 h−1 gDW−1 of the control, proving a significant difference 
(p < 0.001). Dried sediments showed a steady increase in GPP within 
the first 3 weeks with a 27.7-fold increase from the initial activity to 
3.72 ± 0.43 μgO2 h−1 gDW−1, but rapidly declined to 1.14 ± 0.30 μgO2 
h−1 gDW−1 at day 42 (Figure 1B). By contrast, migrated sediments 
provided only a 1.9-fold increase of GPP within 7 days to 4.64 ± 3.00 
μgO2 h−1 gDW−1, before also dropping to 1.56 ± 0.83 μgO2 h−1 gDW−1 
at day 42. We found significant differences in GPP between stressed 
sediments 
and 
the 
control 
until 
day 
161 
(p < 0.05, 
Supplementary Table S2) except for dried sediments at day 21 
(p = 0.201) and migrated sediments at day 42 (p = 0.998) and day 105 
(p = 0.685). GPP of stressed sediments recovered to similar rates as the 
control at day 224 (dried: 5.36 ± 0.86 μgO2 h−1 gDW−1, migrated: 
4.61 ± 0.41 μgO2 h−1 gDW−1, control: 6.48 ± 1.57 μgO2 h−1 gDW−1).
Based on the ratio of GPP to CR (GPP:CR), dried sediments 
started the recovery process net heterotrophic (GPP:CR = 0.34 ± 0.28), 
whereas migrated sediments were net autotrophic (1.63 ± 0.23), 
similar to the control (1.84 ± 0.30, Supplementary Figure S3). GPP:CR 
ratio decreased in all sediments to a seasonal minimum in December 
(day 42), with the control remaining autotrophic (1.03 ± 0.21) and 
both dried (0.43 ± 0.06) and migrated sediments (0.46 ± 0.20) changing 
to net heterotrophy. The stressed sediments remained net 
heterotrophic until day 161 of recovery and returned to the control 
level at day 224.
Potential extracellular enzyme activities
Most C-acquiring enzymes (BG, PO, PP) were not significantly 
different among treatments (Supplementary Table S2). However, the 
potential activity of AP (P-acquiring) and LAP (N-acquiring) matched 
the general trend of increasing CR with ongoing recovery (Figure 2). 
The potential activity of BX was always below the limit of detection. 
Migrated sediments showed especially low initial potential activity for 
BG, NAG, AP, LAP and PO (max. 27.3% of the control values). By 
contrast, NAG, AP and LAP had low potential activities in dried 
sediments (up to 18.4%), but the potential activity of BG was 
surprisingly high (57.9% of the control) and PO even exceeded the 
control (121.7%). AP activity was significantly different from the 
control for both sediment types until day 21 (dried: p = 0.007, 
migrated: 0.011). All potential enzyme activities but that of AP 
increased within 3 weeks (21 days) and were comparable to the control 
(Figure 2). Related to the control, AP was the only enzyme to remain 
at a significantly low potential activity at 35.9% (dried) and 32.0% 
(migrated) of the control even at day 21 (Figure 2).
Bacterial, fungal and diatom community 
structure
The bacterial community was clearly structured according to the 
sediment type [Day 0: F(2,8) = 10.13, p = 0.004; Day 21: F(2,8) = 6.38, 
p = 0.004; Day 105: F(2,8) = 5.05, p = 0.004] and recovery time 
(Supplementary Figure S4A). The largest variability concerning 
temporal development was observed in the bacterial community of 
dried sediments, whereas migrated sediments showed a less 
pronounced community change over time. The PRC presented a 
strong community effect of the sediment type for dried sediments 
(p < 0.05), which intensified with ongoing recovery and did not 
indicate a return to the control at the end of the experiment 
(Figure  3A). Flavobacterium was correlated strongest with the 
community response of dried sediments (1.6-fold increased 
abundance compared to control), whereas several Oxyphotobacteriae 
(phylum Cyanobacteria) had a reduced abundance at all points in 
Oprei et al.

recovery (an average of 69% of the control). The bacterial community 
in migrated sediments showed no community response, and species 
abundances only marginally increased or decreased relative to the 
control during the entire observation period (Figure 3A).
The fungal community structure was significantly impacted by 
sediment type at the start of recovery [F(2,8) = 13.66, p = 0.004] and 
approached the control toward longer recovery time [Day 21: 
F(2,8) = 1.82, p = 0.088; Day 105: F(2,8) = 1.31, p = 0.187]. Fungal 
community structure in dried sediments showed a similar large 
variability between replicates as the bacteria community, especially at 
day 21 (Supplementary Figure S4B). At the same time, the fungal 
community was comparable among migrated sediments and the 
control already at day 21 (Supplementary Figure S4B). The PRC 
demonstrated a strong sediment-type-related community response for 
dried sediments in the beginning, which attenuated toward longer 
recovery (Figure 3B). Alternaria sp. had the highest negative species 
weight at the start of recovery and showed a 22.9-fold increased 
abundance in dried sediments relative to the control. Aureobasidium 
pullulans accounted for the second strongest correlation to the overall 
community response (7.5-fold abundance compared to control). 
Several unclassified fungi showed a contradictory behavior by having 
positive species weights and, therefore, a reduced abundance in dried 
sediments (e.g., a minimum of 32% of the control at the start of 
recovery). Similar to the bacterial community response, the fungal 
response in migrated sediments had a smaller range than in dried 
sediments. The fungal community in migrated sediments, showing 
little or no overall response at the start of recovery, responded only 
very slightly at the end of recovery (Figure 3B), with Alternaria sp. 
being the species with the highest deviation from the control (1.6-fold 
increased abundance). When looking at relative abundance, 
Dothideomycetes were initially the most dominant fungal group in 
dried sediments (in concordance with Schreckinger et al., 2021), but 
their relative abundance decreased with increasing recovery time 
(Supplementary Figure S5).
The diatom community was dominated by small-sized 
morphotypes with a length of <50 μm (44.8%) and 50–100 μm 
(19.8%). The diatom community structure of migrated and dried 
sediments differed significantly from the control at the start of 
recovery [F(2,7) = 9.99, p = 0.004] and was unaffected by sediment type 
thereafter [Day 21: F(2,9) = 1.53, p = 0.203; Day 161: F(2,8) = 1.58, 
p = 0.205]. The PRC, despite high variabilities in all sediments 
depending on recovery time, revealed a strong sediment-type-related 
response, especially in migrated sediments (Figure 3C). All diatom 
morphotypes were negatively affected by the two stresses (showing 
negative species weights), with Navicula occurring only up to 7.9% in 
migrated sediments relative to the control (in dried sediments: 27.5%), 
followed by Fragilaria (migrated: 22.4%, dried: 46.8%) and Achnanthes 
(migrated: 35.1%, dried: 58.7%). Although the sediment-type-related 
PRC score was less pronounced at the end of the experiment, diatom 
abundances were still reduced and did not return to the control level.
Microbial function (CR, GPP, EEA) was significantly correlated 
to bacterial (Mantel test, RM = 0.33, p = 0.043), fungal (RM = 0.30,

p = 0.043) and diatom community structure (RM = 0.46, p = 0.025) at 
the start of recovery. Thereafter, microbial functions were not related 
to community structure at day 21 (bacteria: RM = −0.17, p = 0.783, 
fungi: RM = −0.05, p = 0.560, diatoms: RM = −0.11, p = 0.679) and day 
105 (bacteria: RM = 0.18, p = 0.139, fungi: RM = −0.05, p = 0.584) and 
day 161 (diatoms: RM = −0.11, p = 0.695), respectively.
Bacterial, fungal and diatom abundance
Initial bacterial abundances in migrated (2.65 ± 2.73 × 108 gene 
copies, p = 0.921) and dried sediments (1.08 ± 0.33 × 108 gene copies, 
p = 0.129) were comparable to that in control sediments (3.01 ± 0.54 × 
108 gene copies, Figure 4A; note the large standard deviation among 
replicates). Dried sediments had a significantly lower bacterial 
abundance at day 21 (1.58 ± 1.01 × 108 gene copies, p < 0.001) and day 
105 (1.90 ± 0.78 × 108 gene copies, p = 0.036) compared to the control 
(7.09 ± 1.10 × 108 gene copies), whereas migrated sediments showed a 
similar increase in bacterial abundance (6.51 ± 1.48 × 108 gene copies; 
day 21: p = 0.673; day 105: p = 0.858) as the control. The fungal 
abundance was similar in all sediment types and across sampling dates 
(1.29 ± 1.07 × 108 gene copies, Figure  4B) with the exception of 
significantly lower abundance in dried sediments at day 105 
(0.56 ± 0.39 × 108 gene copies, p = 0.01).
The initial diatom abundance was 3.8-fold higher in dried 
(3.99 ± 0.34 × 105 cells gDW−1) than in migrated sediments (1.04 ± 0.31 
× 105 cells gDW−1), but only their abundance in migrated sediments 
was significantly lower than the control (1.30 ± 1.36 × 106 cells gDW−1, 
p = 0.022, Figure  4C). Within 3 weeks of recovery, the diatom 
abundance of stressed sediments was comparable to that of the control 
(2.14 ± 1.44 × 105 cells gDW−1, dried: p = 0.951, migrated: p = 0.902). 
Similar to diatom abundance trends, dried sediments (0.44 ± 0.02 
μgChla gDW−1) had initially a 2.8-fold higher Chl a concentration 
than migrated sediments (0.15 ± 0.02 μgChla gDW−1, p = 0.001), both 
significantly ranging below the initial Chl a concentration in control 
sediments (1.20 ± 0.13 μgChla gDW−1, p < 0.001, Figure 4D). The Chl a 
increased in both dried and migrated sediments and recovered to 
concentrations of the control within 7 days (dried: p = 0.993, migrated: 
p = 0.574). For the remaining months, Chl a in dried and migrated 
sediments was comparable to the control and increased in all 
sediments until day 224 (Figure  4D). Unlike dried sediments 
(0.47 ± 0.17 μgChla gDW−1, p = 0.323), migrated sediments showed a 
significantly lower Chl a concentration here (0.25 ± 0.08 μgChla 
gDW−1, p < 0.001) compared to control sediments (0.56 ± 0.19 
μgChla gDW−1).
Influence of mesh bags on the seasonality 
of functional and structural parameters
In situ sediments showed little seasonal fluctuations of CR 
(3.94 ± 1.45 μgO2 h−1 gDW−1, n = 28) and GPP (7.45 ± 1.05 μgO2 h−1 
gDW−1, n = 28) over the course of our experiment, with the exception 
of a peak in early spring (CR: 10.06 ± 4.29 μgO2 h−1 gDW−1; GPP:

21.26 ± 6.77 μgO2 h−1 gDW−1, n = 4, Supplementary Figure S6). 
Compared to in situ sediments, the control sediments in mesh bags 
tended to have slightly lower microbial activity and abundances, 
especially in autotrophic parameters (Chl a, GPP:CR ratio) and in 
times of high biomass productivity (spring). The most notable 
discrepancy between in situ sediments and control sediments in mesh 
bags was observed at day 105 of recovery (February) when in situ 
sediments exceeded mesh bags in most parameters, particularly in CR 
and GPP (Supplementary Figures S6–S8). The control sediments in 
mesh bags and the in situ control had a comparable amount of organic 
matter independent of the sampling date (p = 0.83, data not shown). 
The mesh size (250 μm) is a commonly used pore size for microbial 
decomposition processes, e.g., in leaf litter decomposition experiments 
(Lecerf, 2017; Gossiaux et al., 2019; Zhai et al., 2019). We conclude 
that the mesh bag seemed to have dampened seasonal amplitudes in 
most parameters of metabolism and abundance, but mirrored overall 
seasonal fluctuations proportionally.
Discussion
Long-term impacts of sediment drying (severe episodic 
stress) and bedform migration (moderate periodic stress) have 
been largely overlooked in the research on riverbed microbial 
communities. Our experimental study shows that the response of 
the microbial community was not limited to the immediate stress 
release, but persisted for several months. The short durations of 
many published experimental studies (e.g., McKew et al., 2011; 
Truchy et al., 2020) might therefore not cover the time required 
for full microbial community recovery. Investigations of long-
term recovery in the range of months inevitably overlap with 
seasonal variations, such as discharge, temperature, light and 
nutrient supply. Although both stressed sediments paralleled the 
seasonal fluctuations of in situ and control sediments (e.g., 
GPP:CR ratio, Supplementary Figure S1, and Chl a dynamics, 
Supplementary 
Figure 
S6), 
their 
long-term 
recovery 
superimposed these natural seasonal variations. The seasonal 
fluctuations of the control sediments in our mesh bags and the in 
situ sediments were comparable, indicating that the conditions in 
the mesh bags mirrored the natural environment of the microbial 
communities in the riverbed despite lower light availability.
Microbial communities were stressed by 
sediment drying and bedform migration
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study comparing 
the response of microbial communities to sediment drying and 
immobilization. Both sediment drying and migration led to 
reduced CR and GPP, potential activities of P- (AP) and 
N-acquiring (LAP) enzymes, autotrophic and heterotrophic 
abundances, and diverging community structure at the beginning 
of recovery. Sediment drying (Acuña et al., 2005; Corcoll et al., 
2015; Goldman et al., 2017) and bedform migration (Zlatanović 
et al., 2017; Scheidweiler et al., 2021) are described as suppressing 
community metabolism, pointing to the limited resistance of the 
microbial community function (Allison and Martiny, 2008). 
Decreasing enzyme activity as a result of drying slows down the 
degradation of organic matter (Amalfitano et  al., 2008; 
Gionchetta et al., 2019), whereas sediment migration dislocates 
enzymatic activity from the top and mobile layer toward deeper 
and immobile sediment layers (Atkinson et al., 2008).
As expected, the initial bacterial community structure in 
dried sediments differed considerably from the control, whereas 
the effect of bedform migration did not stand out as clearly. The 
sediment drying involved a shift in the bacterial community 
structure which is comparable to other studies (Rees et al., 2006; 
Fazi et al., 2013; Calapez et al., 2014). The fungal community 
structure in dried sediments, similar to the bacterial community 
structure, diverged from the control. The detrimental effects of 
sediment drying on numerous aquatic fungi are shown by the 
decreasing abundance of several unclassified fungi. Classified 
species with increased abundance were Flavobacterium, 
Alternaria sp. and Aureobasidium pullulans. The latter, a yeast-
like fungus, is known for its adaptive phenotypic plasticity and 
ability to colonize extreme environments worldwide (Gostinĉar 
et al., 2012; Xiao et al., 2019). The high content of osmoregulative

aquaporins (Gostinĉar et  al., 2012) and the accumulation of 
melanin, a protective dark pigment in fungal cell walls, are 
assumed to contribute to its drought resistance (Gostinĉar et al., 
2012). Thus, the ability of specific fungi species to cope with 
drying could explain the realignment of fungal communities 
from dried and control sediments within 21 days.
In contrast to heterotrophs, the autotrophic community 
structure was affected by both sediment drying and bedform 
migration. The abundance of the dominant diatom morphotypes 
Navicula, Fragilaria and Achnanthes was initially about one order 
of magnitude lower in stressed sediments compared to the 
control. Diatom frustules suffer mechanical damage when 
colliding with mobile sand grains and their habitable area is thus 
reduced to the fissures and crevices of sand grains (Miller et al., 
1987; Delgado et al., 1991). In addition, microbes are perpetually 
buried beneath depositing grains in migrating bedforms. The 
resulting light reduction seemed to have a stronger effect on the 
autotrophic community than on the heterotrophic community 
(Wilkes et  al., 2019). Diatoms are known to be  particularly 
sensitive to drought (Romaní et al., 2013; Piano et al., 2017) and 
in dried sediments the community is characterized only by a few 
abundant and dominant taxa (Mathooko et al., 2005), similar to 
our observations. Yet, their physiology (i.e., r-selected traits, 
short generation times) facilitates quick recovery upon stress 
relief if environmental conditions allow (Ledger et  al., 2013; 
Calapez et al., 2014; Barthès et al., 2015).
Heterotrophic processes dominated during 
recovery
The benthic microbial communities responded to the relief from 
stress by immediately increasing their metabolic activity until full 
functional recovery within 8 months. The potential EEA of both types 
of stressed sediments reached activities of the control after only 3 
weeks of recovery (except for aminopeptidase and phosphatase). This 
result is consistent with the EEA recovery (10–14 days) observed 
following stream rewetting after 13 weeks of drying (Pohlon et al., 
2013). The recovering bacterial community is described as having a 
high need for C, N, and P, which, in turn, fuels the synthesis of related 
enzymes (Ylla et  al., 2010). Thus, our results highlight that the 
accumulated resources during sediment drying and migration are 
quickly metabolized by EEA upon rewetting and immobilization, 
respectively. These results support our first hypothesis, illustrating that 
microbial communities in temperate riverbeds recover functionally 
from previous stresses irrespective of the stressor type, and match 
reported positive short-term recovery trends from drying and 
migrating (Marxsen et al., 2010; Pohlon et al., 2013; Oprei et al., 2019).
The time required for full recovery of autotrophic activity (GPP, 
more than 5 months) exceeded that for heterotrophic activity (CR, 
less than 7 days), which explains the shift toward heterotrophy as 
suggested in past studies (Timoner et al., 2012; Veach et al., 2016; 
Colls et al., 2019). Both dried and migrated sediments were net 
heterotrophic between 6 weeks and 4 months of recovery (December

to February). By contrast, the control remained net autotrophic even 
during the light-limited winter months. Low EEA potentials are also 
known to correlate with the heterotrophic dominance in microbial 
communities (Romaní and Sabater, 2000), matching our observations 
of net heterotrophy during recovery. Hence, both drying and 
migrating caused a long-lasting shift toward net heterotrophy. Both 
stresses had a minor effect on heterotrophs (i.e., bacterial and fungal 
abundances), while autotrophs (i.e., Chl a and the abundance of 
diatoms) were clearly affected. Autotrophs are described to be more 
resilient to drying, whereas heterotrophs are known to be  more 
resistant (Timoner et al., 2012; Acuña et al., 2015). The comparable 
bacterial and fungal abundances between stressed and control 
sediments could be related to methodological constraints. We used 
qPCR to quantify bacteria and fungi that replicate all DNA in a 
sample. Therefore, it is possible that a fraction of gene copies counted 
in stressed sediments was actually from inactive cells (dead or spore) 
falsely indicating heterotrophic resistance.
Although CR and GPP are a reliable and well-established measure 
of overall ecosystem metabolism (Fellows et al., 2006; del Giorgio and 
Williams, 2008; Young et al., 2008), this method has the fallback of 
being a “black box” approach for microbial function. Integrating 
molecular approaches such as metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics 
and metabolomics, might deepen our understanding of individual 
processes, transformations and functional recovery on the micro- and 
nanoscale (Mapelli et al., 2008; Jansson et al., 2012; Franzosa et al., 
2015; Biswas and Sarkar, 2018).
Functional recovery is decoupled from 
structural recovery
Our results imply a partial decoupling between functional and 
structural recovery in microbial communities based on Mantel test 
results, which confirm our second hypothesis. The probably light-
limited, seasonally induced decrease in Chl a contrasted with the 
increase of GPP during the first 3 weeks of recovery and points to a 
decoupling of primary production and autotroph biomass, as it has 
already been observed in migrating sediments (Scheidweiler et al., 
2021) and lentic sediments after nutrient enrichment (McCormick 
et al., 2019). Despite the decoupling observed between GPP and Chl 
a, the long time needed for GPP recovery coincided with the 
diminished population of some dominant diatom morphotypes, for 
example, Navicula and Fragilaria. Past studies highlighted that the 
abundance of individual taxa can be proportional or disproportional 
to their contribution to the ecosystem metabolism, and suggest that 
functional traits of individual species play a bigger role in microbial 
metabolism than overall community structure (Han and Furuya, 
2000; McCormick et al., 2019).
In contrast to the strictly negatively affected diatoms, the 
heterotrophic community was characterized by both positive and 
negative PRC species weights and showed distinct community 
structure during recovery. Although poorly resistant microbial 
communities are often prone to an alteration after undergoing a stress 
period (Allison and Martiny, 2008), ecological processes may 
be restored at the community level due to multifaceted functional 
redundancy and metabolic plasticity (Comte et al., 2013; Woodward 
et al., 2015; Louca et al., 2018). The functional gene pool in microbial 
communities with contrasting taxonomic compositions, for example, 
was found to be similar (Burke et al., 2011; Dopheide et al., 2015), 
enabling the quick resumption of viable functions after stress despite 
lacking structural resilience (Barthès et al., 2015). In our experiment, 
this held true for CR and most EEA (full recovery within 3 weeks), 
but not for GPP.
Findings from recent studies have challenged the concept of 
functional redundancy in microbiology, as high structural 
biodiversity correlates with multifunctionality and a broad diversity 
of metabolic pathways (Peter et al., 2011; Galand et al., 2018) and 
increases community resistance to stress (Steudel et al., 2012; Feng 
et  al., 2017). In turn, reduced trophic complexity in microbial 
communities provoked by loss of species engenders a decrease in 
community function (Santschi et al., 2018). Thus, the long recovery 
time for GPP in our study could have been a secondary consequence 
of the strictly negative effects of drying and bedform migration on 
autotrophic abundance and community structure seen in the 
PRC. In contrast, bacterial and fungal abundance was characterized 
by both positive and negative changes driven by sediment type and 
individual species. Therefore, the heterogeneity in bacterial and 
fungal stress response points to a partial disentanglement of 
metabolic function and heterotrophic community structure 
(Langenheder et al., 2005) and probably facilitated the fast recovery 
of CR at the community level.
Stressor type shapes long-term structural 
but not functional recovery
Benthic heterotrophic communities that experienced drying 
initially showed a stronger structural response than those that 
experienced bedform migration. This result indicates that episodic 
drying had a more devastating impact on the heterotrophic microbial 
community than periodic bedform migration. Our results endorse 
former observations that the microbial reaction is linked to the 
previous stress intensity (Berga et  al., 2012). Apart from the 
immediate short-term recovery, the stressor type had no further 
impact on the long-term recovery of microbial function, therefore, 
partly rejecting our third hypothesis. Our results suggest that the type 
and severity of stress shapes the functional recovery shortly after the 
relief from stress, but this regulative effect does not persist in the 
long-term. The parallel development of microbial function, being 
irrespective of the previous stressor type, builds on a deterministic 
succession of bacterial communities (driven by abiotic environment, 
i.e., nutrient supply, substrate availability, chemical properties) on a 
functional level (Veach et  al., 2016). Therefore, when formerly 
distinct communities (i.e., from dried and migrated sediments) are 
placed into a similar environment (i.e., rewetted and immobilized), 
their functional services will converge in the long-term.
Opposed to community function, the stress type had longer-lasting 
effects on the microbial community structure, which is in line with our 
third hypothesis. We infer this behavior from secondary successional 
dynamics following a stress-induced degeneration of a mature community 
(Kearns and Shade, 2018). Post-stress colonization occurs through both 
resistant local taxa inhabiting the stressed sediments, as well as 
immigrating regional taxa from the surrounding water column and 
neighboring habitats (Folke et  al., 2004; Kearns and Shade, 2018).

However, the convergence of communities was not reached in the 
timescale of our experiment, as the structures of the bacterial (except 
migrated sediments), fungal and diatom community were still distinct 
between stressed and control sediments at 105 and 161 days of recovery, 
respectively. Our results suggest that the impacts of sediment drying and 
migrating are not limited to the recovery period observed here, but persist 
further as a legacy effect that can influence the long-term successional 
trajectory of community assembly (Andersson et al., 2014; Hawkes and 
Keitt, 2015; Vass and Langenheder, 2017). Most microbial communities 
in temperate streams are subject to seasonal fluctuations regarding their 
structural assemblage, abundance and EEA (Wilczek et al., 2005; Hullar 
et al., 2006; Paruch et al., 2020) and their natural dieback in fall overlaps 
with the recovery period from summer drying and immobilization 
observed in our experiment. To the best of our knowledge, the fact that a 
stress-induced community shift can outlast seasonal variations and may 
be carried along to the next episodic stress period, acting as a legacy effect 
and, thus, influencing future responses of the microbial community 
toward the stress, has not been observed before. Based on our results, it is 
still unclear whether the microbial community structure in stressed 
sediments will further approximate that of the control if recovery lasts 
longer than three and a half months, i.e., if the legacy effect is temporary 
or permanent.
Importance of recurring stress events
We showed that microbial communities of a riverbed were 
capable of recovering functionally and structurally from both 
stressors, i.e., sediment drying and bedform migration. Autotrophic 
activity (GPP) had a long recovery time (at least 6 months), which 
was independent of the previous stress type but influenced by 
seasonal dynamics. By contrast, heterotrophic activity (CR) 
resumed rapidly subsequent to the stress. The long recovery times 
observed in our experiment imply that the previous stress type 
creates a legacy effect on the recovery trajectory in the microbial 
community structure despite revealing no prolonged impacts on the 
functional recovery. The time required for microbial recovery that 
became evident in our study ranges in the temporal scale of 
seasonally driven variations in benthic community function and 
structure. Whereas seasonal changes of environmental conditions 
did not alter the long-term recovery pathway of benthic microbial 
communities, we argue that the starting point of recovery cannot 
be uncoupled from the season. Furthermore, the effects of recurring 
stress periods, repeatedly interrupting the recovery process, are 
likely to hamper the ongoing structural reorganization of microbial 
communities and narrow the capacity for resilience, hence, 
increasing the role of legacy effects in freshwater ecosystems. Future 
experiments should consider incorporating multiple cross-seasonal 
stress recovery cycles to account for the seasonal priming of the 
community reorganization and the closely linked long-term 
(lagged) stress effects.
