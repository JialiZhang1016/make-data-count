Abstract 
Background:  Fish injury and mortality resulting from entrainment and/or impingement during downstream passage 
over/through hydropower infrastructure has the potential to cause negative effects on fish populations. The primary 
goal of this systematic review was to address two research questions: (1) What are the consequences of hydroelectric 
dam fish entrainment and impingement on freshwater fish productivity in temperate regions?; (2) To what extent 
do various factors like site type, intervention type, and life history characteristics influence the consequences of fish 
entrainment and impingement?
Methods:  The review was conducted using guidelines provided by the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence 
and examined commercially published and grey literature. All articles found using a systematic search were screened 
using a priori eligibility criteria at two stages (title and abstract, and full-text, respectively), with consistency checks 
being performed at each stage. The validity of studies was appraised and data were extracted using tools explicitly 
designed for this review. A narrative synthesis encompassed all relevant studies and a quantitative synthesis (meta-
analysis) was conducted where appropriate.
Review findings:  A total of 264 studies from 87 articles were included for critical appraisal and narrative synthesis. 
Studies were primarily conducted in the United States (93%) on genera in the Salmonidae family (86%). The evidence 
base did not allow for an evaluation of the consequences of entrainment/impingement on fish productivity per 
se; therefore, we evaluated the risk of freshwater fish injury and mortality owing to downstream passage through 
common hydropower infrastructure. Our quantitative synthesis suggested an overall increased risk of injury and 
immediate mortality from passage through/over hydropower infrastructure. Injury and immediate mortality risk 
varied among infrastructure types. Bypasses resulted in decreased injury risk relative to controls, whereas turbines and 
spillways were associated with the highest injury risks relative to controls. Within turbine studies, those conducted in 
a lab setting were associated with higher injury risk than field-based studies, and studies with longer assessment time

Background
Worldwide over 58,000 dams (> 15 m height) have been 
constructed for various uses including irrigation, flood 
control, navigation, and hydroelectric power genera-
tion [1]. As the number of dams continues to increase 
worldwide, so too have concerns for their effects on fish 
populations. Dams can act as a barrier to migratory (i.e., 
anadromous, catadromous, potamodromous) and resi-
dent fish (i.e., those that complete their life cycle within 
a reservoir or section of the river), fragmenting rivers 
and degrading habitats. The negative impacts of dams 
on upstream migration of diadromous fish are widely 
acknowledged, and the installation of various types of 
fishways to facilitate upstream passage are common-
place [2]. However, downstream migration of fish at 
dams remains a challenge [3, 4]. Depending upon the life 
history of a given migratory fish, mature adults seeking 
spawning grounds (catadromous species) or juveniles or 
post-spawn adults (iteroparous species) seeking rearing 
and feeding habitats (anadromous species) may all need 
to move downstream past dams. Resident species may 
also move considerable distances throughout a river-
ine system for reproduction, rearing, and foraging (e.g., 
Kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka; White Sucker Catostomus 
commersonii; Walleye Sander vitreus) or simply move 
throughout reservoirs where they may traverse forebay 
areas.
Injury and mortality resulting from entrainment, when 
fish (non-)volitionally pass through hydropower infra-
structure, or impingement, when fish become trapped 
against infrastructure, associated with hydroelectric 
facilities may have serious consequences for fish popu-
lations [5, 6]. Sources of entrainment or impingement-
related injury or mortality include the following: (1) fish 
passage through hydroelectric infrastructure (i.e., tur-
bines, spillways, sluiceways, and other passage routes) 
during downstream migration for migratory fish; (2) the 
entrainment of resident fish; and (3) the impingement of 
adult or large fish (migratory or resident) against screens/
trash racks. Some hydropower facilities are equipped 
with fish collection and bypass systems, primarily for 
juvenile salmonids, to facilitate downstream passage. 
Migrating fish will use existing dam structures such as 
spillways and outlet works, used to release and regulate 
water flow, for downstream passage. When no bypass 
is available and there are no spills occurring owing to 
low reservoir water levels, both resident and facultative 
migrant fish can be attracted to the turbine intake tun-
nels, often the only other source of downstream flow 
present in the forebay area of the dam. Entrainment, 
occurring when fish travel through a hydro dam to the 
tailraces, can result in physical injury and mortality from 
fish passing through turbines and associated components 
[7, 8]. Injury and mortality can occur through several 
means from hydroelectric components. Freefall from 
passing over a spillway, abrasion, scrapes, and mechani-
cal strikes from turbine blades are well known causes of 
physical injury and mortality (reviewed in [6–8]). Injuries 
from turbulence and shear owing to water velocity differ-
entials across the body length, occurs when passing over 
a spillway or through turbine components [7, 9]. Water 
pressure associated injuries and mortality can occur from 
periods (≥ 24–48 h) were associated with higher risk than shorter duration assessment periods (< 24 h). Turbines and 
sluiceways were associated with the highest immediate mortality risk relative to controls. Within turbine studies, lab-
based studies had higher mortality risk ratios than field-based studies. Within field studies, Francis turbines resulted 
in a higher immediate mortality risk than Kaplan turbines relative to controls, and wild sourced fish had a higher 
immediate mortality risk than hatchery sourced fish in Kaplan turbines. No other associations between effect size and 
moderators were identified. Taxonomic analyses revealed a significant increased injury and immediate mortality risk 
relative to controls for genera Alosa (river herring) and Oncorhynchus (Pacific salmonids), and delayed mortality risk for 
Anguilla (freshwater eels).
Conclusions:  Our synthesis suggests that hydropower infrastructure in temperate regions increased the overall risk 
of freshwater fish injury and immediate mortality relative to controls. The evidence base confirmed that turbines and 
spillways increase the risk of injury and/or mortality for downstream passing fish compared to controls. Differences 
in lab- and field-based studies were evident, highlighting the need for further studies to understand the sources of 
variation among lab- and field-based studies. We were unable to examine delayed mortality, likely due to the lack of 
consistency in monitoring for post-passage delayed injury and mortality. Our synthesis suggests that bypasses are the 
most “fish friendly” passage option in terms of reducing fish injury and mortality. To address knowledge gaps, studies 
are needed that focus on systems outside of North America, on non-salmonid or non-sportfish target species, and on 
population-level consequences of fish entrainment/impingement.

low pressure, rapid changes in pressure, shear stress, tur-
bulence, cavitation (extremely low water pressures that 
cause the formation of bubbles which subsequently col-
lapse violently), strikes, or grinding when fish become 
entrained in turbine components [5, 10, 11]. Injury 
and mortality can also occur from fish being impinged 
against screens or trash racks that are intended to pre-
vent debris, or in some cases fish, from being drawn into 
water intakes [12].
Since downstream migrants are not often observed 
(e.g., juvenile fish), historically far less consideration has 
been afforded to downstream passage, such that manage-
ment strategies and/or structures specifically designed 
to accommodate downstream passage were not imple-
mented nearly as frequently [13]. To date, literature on 
downstream passage largely focuses on juvenile survival, 
particularly in Pacific salmonids Oncorhynchus spp., pop-
ular commercial and recreational species in which the 
adults senesce after spawning. Minimal research exists 
on downstream passage and entrainment risk of resi-
dent fish species [6]. However, research on adult down-
stream passage in migratory fish is growing in popularity 
in temperate Europe and North America, particularly 
for species of conservation interest such as eels Anguilla 
spp. [14–19] and sturgeons Acipenser spp. [20–22]. To 
enhance downstream passage and reduce mortality, 
management strategies have included selectively timing 
spills to aid juvenile fish, the installation of “fish friendly” 
bypass systems and screens directing fish to these sys-
tems, and retrofitting dams with low-volume surface flow 
outlets [23] or removable spillway structures designed to 
minimize fish harm [24]. The use of light, sound, bubble 
curtains, and electrical currents to act as repellent from 
harmful paths or potentially an attractant to more desir-
able (fish friendly) paths have been explored [25–27]. 
Given that the timing of downstream migration differs 
among life stages and is species-dependent [6], mitigat-
ing injury and mortality during downstream passage in a 
multispecies system could prove challenging and disrup-
tive to power generation operations. Furthermore, opera-
tional strategies can be complicated by environmental 
regulations such as water quality requirements.
From a fish productivity perspective, minimizing 
impacts during downstream passage for migratory fish, 
unintended entrainment of resident species, and/or fish 
impingement, is an integral part of managing fish pro-
ductivity. Downstream passage mortality from a sin-
gle hydropower dam may appear low (i.e., 5–10%), but 
system-wide cumulative mortalities may be consider-
able in systems greatly fragmented by multiple dams 
[28]. Adult survival affects population dynamics (e.g., 
effective population size), and thus fisheries yields (e.g., 
sustainable yield, maximum sustainable yield). Juvenile 
survival affects recruitment (i.e., fish reaching an age 
class considered part of a fishery), ultimately contribut-
ing to fisheries productivity. Literature reviews and tech-
nical reports compiled to date have primarily focused on 
how fish injury and mortality occurs, and/or evaluate the 
effectiveness of various management strategies used to 
mitigate harm during downstream passage [6–8]. Given 
the contributions of migratory and resident adults and 
juveniles to fish production, a natural extension would be 
evaluating the impacts of fish injury and mortality from 
hydropower dam entrainment and impingement on fish 
productivity. Here, we use a ‘systematic review’ approach 
[29] to evaluate the existing literature base to assess the 
consequences of hydroelectric dam entrainment and 
impingement on freshwater fish productivity, and to 
identify to what extent factors like site type, intervention 
type, and life history characteristics influence the impact 
of different hydroelectric infrastructure on fish entrain-
ment and impingement.
Topic identification and stakeholder input
During the formulation of the question for this review, 
an Advisory Team made up of stakeholders and experts 
was established and consulted. This team included aca-
demics, staff from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory 
(U.S. Department of Energy) and staff from Fisheries 
and Oceans Canada (DFO), specifically the Fish and Fish 
Habitat Protection Program (FFHPP) and Science Branch. 
The Advisory Team guided the focus of this review to 
ensure the primary question was both answerable and rel-
evant, and suggested search terms to capture the relevant 
literature. The Advisory Team was also consulted in the 
development of the inclusion criteria for article screening 
and the list of specialist websites for searches.
Objective of the review
The objective of the systematic review was to evaluate the 
existing literature base to assess the consequences of fish 
entrainment and impingement associated with hydro-
electric dams in freshwater temperate environments.

What are the consequences of hydroelectric dam fish 
entrainment and impingement on freshwater fish pro-
ductivity in temperate regions?
Components of the primary question
The primary study question can be broken down into the 
study components:
Subject (population): Freshwater fish, including dia-
dromous species, in temperate regions.
Page 4 of 36
Algera et al. Environ Evid             (2020) 9:3 
Intervention: Infrastructure associated with hydro-
electric facilities (i.e., turbines, spillways, sluiceways, 
outlet works, screens, water bypasses, louvers, fish 
ladders, penstocks, trash racks, etc.,).

individual performance, migration, reproduction, 
population sustainability, and population viability).
Secondary question
To what extent do factors such as site type, intervention 
type, life history characteristics influence the impact of 
fish entrainment and impingement?
Methods
The search strategy for this review was structured 
according to the guidelines provided by the Collabora-
tion for Environmental Evidence [30] and followed that 
published in the a priori systematic review protocol [31]. 
Note, no deviations were made from the protocol.

Search terms were limited to English language due to 
project resource restrictions. The search string was 
modified depending on the functionality of different 
databases, specialist websites and search engine (see 
Additional file 1). Full details on search settings and sub-
scriptions can be found in Additional file 1. To ensure the 
comprehensiveness of our search, the search results were 
checked against a benchmark list of relevant papers pro-
vided by the Advisory Team. We also searched the refer-
ence lists of papers, until the number of relevant returns 
significantly decreased. This increased the likelihood that 
relevant articles not captured by the literature search 
were still considered.
Publication databases
The following bibliographic databases were searched in 
December 2016 using Carleton University’s institutional 
subscriptions:
1.	 ISI Web of Science core collection.
2.	 Scopus.
3.	 ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global.
4.	 WAVES (Fisheries and Oceans Canada).
5.	 Science.gov.
Note, the Fisheries and Oceans Canada database 
(WAVES) became a member of the Federal Science 
Library (FSL) in 2017 after this search was conducted 
(see Additional file 1).
Search engines
Internet searches were conducted in December 2016 
using the search engine Google Scholar (first 500 hits 
sorted by relevance). Potentially useful documents that 
had not already been found in publication databases 
were recorded and screened for the appropriate fit for the 
review questions.
Specialist websites
Specialist organization websites listed below were 
searched in February 2017 using abbreviated search 
terms [i.e., search strings (1) fish AND hydro AND 
entrainment; (2) fish AND hydro AND impingement; (3) 
fish AND hydro AND mortality; and (4) fish AND hydro 
AND injury]. Page data from the first 20 search results 
for each search string were extracted (i.e., 80 hits per 
website), screened for relevance, and searched for links 
or references to relevant publications, data and grey liter-
ature. Potentially useful documents that had not already 
been found using publication databases or search engines 
were recorded.

Other literature searches
Reference sections of accepted articles and 168 relevant 
reviews were hand searched to evaluate relevant titles 
that were not found using the search strategy (see Addi-
tional file  2 for a list of relevant reviews). Stakeholders 
were consulted for insight and advice for new sources of 
information. We also issued a call for evidence to target 
sources of grey literature through relevant mailing lists 
(Canadian Conference for Fisheries Research, American 
Fisheries Society), and through social media (e.g., Twit-
ter, Facebook) in February and November 2017. The call 
for evidence was also distributed by the Advisory Team 
to relevant networks and colleagues.
Estimating comprehensiveness of the search
We did not undertake an explicit test of the comprehen-
sive of our search by checking our search results against 
a benchmark list of relevant papers. This was largely 
because we knew that most of the evidence base on this 
topic was going to be considered grey literature sources, 
making estimation of comprehensiveness challenging. 
However, as mentioned above, we screened bibliogra-
phies of: (1) a large number of relevant reviews identified 
at title and abstract (84 reviews) or full-text screening (30 
reviews); (2) additional relevant reviews identified from 
within the bibliographies of the reviews (54 reviews); and 
(3) included articles. We searched these reference lists of 
papers until the reviewer deemed that the number of rel-
evant returns had significantly decreased. This increased 
the likelihood that relevant articles not captured by the 
literature search were still considered.
Assembling a library of search results
All articles generated by publication databases and 
Google Scholar were exported into separate Zotero data-
bases. After all searches were complete and references 
found using each different strategy were compiled, the 
individual databases were exported into EPPI-reviewer 
(eppi.ioe.ac.uk/eppireviewer4) as one database. Due to 
restrictions on exporting search results, the Waves data-
base results were screened in a separate Excel spread-
sheet. Prior to screening, duplicates were identified using 
a function in EPPI Reviewer and then were manually 
removed by one reviewer (TR). One reviewer manu-
ally identified and removed any duplicates in the Waves 
spreadsheet (TR). All references regardless of their per-
ceived relevance to this systematic review were included 
in the database.
Article screening and study eligibility criteria
Screening process
Articles found by database searches and the search 
engine were screened in two distinct stages: (1) title and 
abstract, and (2) full text. Articles or datasets found by 
other means than database or search engine searches 
(i.e., specialist website or other literature searches) were 
Page 6 of 36
Algera et al. Environ Evid             (2020) 9:3 
entered at the second stage of this screening process (i.e., 
full text) but were not included in consistency checks. 
Prior to screening all articles, a consistency check was 
done at title and abstract stage where two reviewers 
(DAA and TR) screened 233/2324 articles (10% of the 
articles included in EPPI Reviewer which did not include 
grey literature, other sources of literature, or the articles 
in the Waves excel spreadsheet). The reviewers agreed 
on 86.30% of the articles. Any disagreements between 
screeners were discussed and resolved before moving 
forward. If there was any further uncertainty, the Review 
Team discussed those articles as a group to come up with 
a decision. Attempts were made to locate full-texts of 
all articles remaining after title and abstract in the Car-
leton University library and by using interlibrary loans. 
Reviewers did not screen studies (at title and abstract or 
full-text) for which they were an author.
A consistency check was done again at full-text screen-
ing with 51/500 articles (10% of the articles included in 
EPPI Reviewer which did not include grey literature, 
other sources of literature, or the articles in the Waves 
excel spreadsheet). Reviewers (DAA and TR) agreed on 
90.2% of articles. After discussing and resolving incon-
sistencies, the screening by a single reviewer (DAA) was 
allowed to proceed. A list of all articles excluded on the 
basis of full-text assessment is provided in Additional 
file 2, together with the reasons for exclusion.
Eligibility criteria
Each article had to pass each of the following criteria to 
be included:
Eligible populations  The relevant subjects of this review 
were any fish species, including diadromous species, in 
North (23.5° N to 66.5° N) or South (23.5° S to 66.5° S) 
temperate regions. Only articles located in freshwater 
ecosystems, including lakes, rivers, and streams that con-
tain fish species that are associated with a hydroelectric 
dam system were included.
Eligible interventions  Articles that described infra-
structure associated with hydroelectric facilities that may 
cause fish to be entrained or impinged (i.e., turbines, spill-
ways, sluiceways, outlet works, screens, tailraces, water 
bypasses, tailwaters, penstocks, trash racks, etc.) were 
included. Articles that examined “general infrastructure”, 
where entrainment or impingement was examined but 
no specific infrastructure component was isolated, were 
also included for data extraction. See Table 1 for defini-
tions of the intervention types considered in the review. 
Only articles that describe water that moves via gravity 
were included. Articles were excluded where water was 
actively pumped for: (1) power generation (e.g., storage 
ponds [32]); (2) irrigation; or (3) cooling-water in-take 
structures for thermoelectric power plants. Other studies 
excluded described infrastructure associated with other 
operations: (1) nuclear facilities; (2) dams without hydro; 
(3) hydrokinetic systems (i.e., energy from waves/cur-
rents); or (4) general water withdrawal systems (e.g., for 
municipal drinking, recreation).
Eligible comparators  This review compared outcomes 
based on articles that used Control-Impact (CI) and Con-
trolled Trials (randomized or not). Before-After (BA) and 
studies that combined BA and CI designs, Before-After-
Control-Impact (BACI), were considered for inclusion 
but none were found (i.e., there were no studies that col-
lected before intervention data within same waterbody 
pre-installation/modification). 
Relevant 
comparators 
included: (1) no intervention (e.g., control experiments 
whereby each phase of a test procedure was examined for 
sources of mortality/injury other than passage through 
infrastructure such as upstream introduction and/or 
downstream recovery apparatus); (2) an unmodified ver-
sion of the intervention on the same or different study 
waterbody, or (3) controlled flume study. Studies that only 
reported impact (i.e., treatment) data (i.e., no control site 
data) were excluded from this review. Note, at the request 
of stakeholders, studies that only reported impact-only 
data were included through the full-text screening stage 
but were excluded during the initial data extraction stage 
to obtain an estimate of the number of studies that used 
this type of study design in this area of study. Simulation 
studies, review papers, and policy discussions were also 
excluded from this review.
Eligible 
outcomes  Population-level 
assessments 
of 
entrainment and impingement impacts on fish produc-
tivity outcomes were considered for inclusion but were 
rarely conducted. Most metrics used to evaluate con-
sequences of fish entrainment and impingement were 
related to fish mortality and injury. Any articles that used 
a metric related to: (1) lethal impact: direct fish mortal-
ity or indirect mortality (e.g., fish are disoriented after 
passage through hydroelectric dam and then predated 
upon), and (2) sublethal impacts: external and/or internal 
injury assessments (e.g., signs of scale loss, barotrauma, 
blade strike, etc.,)—were included. These metrics could 
include, but were not limited to, reported mortality rate 
(%, number), survival rate (%), recovery rate (%, number), 
the number of fish impinged or entrained (i.e., used as 
a measure of risk of impingement/entrainment and not 
mortality/injury per se), injury rate (% of population) with 
particular types of injuries (e.g., signs of blade strike), all 
injury types combined, or numbers of injuries.

A combination of structures designed to control reservoir water levels and/or water release for hydropower facility operations. 
Structures can include intake towers, outlet tunnels and/or conduits, control gates, and discharge channels. Intake structures 
can have trash racks or other purposefully designed fish intakes
 Penstock
An intake structure (channel, pipe) that leads into the turbines
 Screen
An exclusionary device to prevent fish from entering a structure (e.g., turbine) or divert fish towards a bypass
 Spillway
An outlet or channel in a dam or reservoir that discharges surplus water downstream of a dam. Spillways can vary by design 
(e.g., channel type, height)
 Sluiceways
A surface channel extending from the forebay to the tailrace designed to allow ice and debris to pass
 Surface bypasses
Structures that spill minimal amounts of water to facilitate passage over a dam. Several types exist (see [23]). Fish are collected 
and pass through a series channels that discharges downstream of the facility into the tailrace. Typically used for juvenile 
salmonids, taking advantage of their surface-oriented swimming behaviour
 Trash rack
A type of exclusionary device designed to keep debris out of turbine intakes, but can be used to guide fish to “safer” passage 
routes such as bypasses and sluices
 Turbine (hydraulic)
A structure that converts the energy of flowing water into mechanical energy. There are several turbine types with different 
configurations, the most common are Francis and Kaplan (see definitions below)
 Kaplan turbine
An “axial”, vertical, propeller-like turbine used for lower pressure heads (less than 100 m). Smaller in overall size (relative to 
Francis), typically has 4 to 8 adjustable blades and a specific running speed ranging 250 to 850 rpm
 Francis turbine
A “radial” turbine used for higher pressure heads (100 to 500 m). Larger in overall size (relative to Kaplan), typically has 16 to 24 
fixed blades and a specific running speed of 50 to 250 rpm
 Turbine bypass
A structure that fish can enter from the gatewell, bypasses the turbines and powerhouse through a series of channels, and 
discharges downstream into the tailrace. Typically used for juvenile salmonids
Fish injuries/impacts
 Abrasion
Damage to skin and/or scales
 Blade strike
Turbine blade striking a fish. Can result in injuries/mortality from grinding (depending on blade spacing, small fish more prone 
to this), bruising, and cuts of varying severity (superficial, mortal wounding)
 Barotrauma
Damage caused from exposure to rapid changes in barometric pressure, typically during turbine passage. The most common 
injuries/mortalities are related to swim bladder ruptures. In the presence of high total dissolved gasses, rapid pressure 
changes can cause gas embolisms in tissues/organs and other symptoms of gas bubble disease
 Descaling
Scale loss. Often expressed as a percentage of the scale loss on the whole fish (e.g., 20% scale loss)
 Entrainment
When fish (non-) volitionally pass through hydropower infrastructure
 Hemorrhage
Bleeding, blood loss
 Impingement
When a fish becomes pinned/trapped against an infrastructure
 Cavitation
Formation of gas bubbles in water, which when collapsed generate a pressure wave that can cause ill effects for fish in close 
proximity
 Mechanical effects
Damage (injury/mortality) caused from fish physically interacting with structures (e.g., blade strike)
 Pressure effects
Rapid changes in pressure (perpendicular to surface, dorsoventral) during passage that can cause fish damage
 Shear effects
Rapid changes in pressure (parallel to surface, anteroposterior) during passage that can cause fish damage
 Turbulence effects
Damage (injury/mortality) to fish caused by turbulent water (irregular movement of water)
General terms
 Forebay
Impoundment area directly above a hydropower facility
 Head
Difference in elevation between two water levels (e.g., reservoir water level and tailrace). There are various operational head 
definitions (see [34])

Furthermore, linkages between intervention and 
outcome needed to have been made clear to allow for 
the effects of fish mortality/injury from entrainment 
and impingement to be isolated from other poten-
tial impacts of hydroelectric power production such 
as barriers to migration and/or habitat degradation. 
Studies were excluded where no clear linkage between 
intervention and outcome were identified (e.g., if fish 
density was surveyed up-and down-stream of a hydro 
dam but any difference or change in fish density could 
not be clearly attributed to impingement or entrain-
ment in isolation of other effects). Fish passage/guid-
ance efficiency studies that determined the number 
of fish that passed through a particular hydropower 
system, typically through a bypass or under differing 
operating conditions, were excluded if there was no 
explicit entrainment/impingement or injury/mortal-
ity assessment. Studies that investigated passage route 
deterrence and/or enhanced passage efficiency facili-
tated via behavioural guidance devices and techniques 
(e.g., bubble screens, lights, sound; reviewed in [25]) 
were excluded, except where mortality or injury was 
assessed.
Language  Only English-language literature was included 
during the screening stage.
Study validity assessment
All studies included on the basis of full-text assessment 
were critically appraised for internal validity (suscepti-
bility to bias) using a predefined framework (see Table 2 
for definitions of terms such as study). If a study con-
tained more than one project (i.e., differed with respect 
to one or more components of critical appraisal; see 
Table 3), each project received an individual validity rat-
ing and was labelled in the data extraction table with 
letters (e.g., “Ruggles and Palmeter 1989 A/B/C” indicat-
ing that there are three projects within the Ruggles and 
Palmeter article). For example, sample size (i.e., the total 
number of fish released) was an internal validity criterion 
(Table 3). If a study conducted a project with a sample 
size of > 100 fish it received a different internal validity 
assessment label than a project that used < 50 fish. The 
critical appraisal framework (see Table 3) developed for 
this review considered the features recommended by 
Bilotta et al. [36] and was adapted to incorporate com-
ponents specific to the studies that answer our primary

Study
If at a given site, evaluations of responses were conducted for different: (1) operational conditions (e.g., turbine discharge, wicket gate 
opening width, dam height); (2) modifications of a specific intervention (e.g., number of turbine runner blades); or (3) depth at fish release; 
we considered these separate studies and each were given a “Study ID”. If at a given site, evaluations of responses were conducted for 
different interventions (e.g., mortality at turbines and at spillways), we only considered these separate studies if the fish were released 
separately for each intervention (i.e., different release points immediately above the intervention under evaluation, within the same or 
different years). When studies released a group of fish at a single location above all interventions, and the outcomes came from route-
specific evaluations, these were considered the same study and received the same Study ID. Used throughout the review

question. The framework used to assess study valid-
ity was reviewed by the Advisory Team to ensure that it 
accurately reflected the characteristics of a well-designed 
study. The criteria in our critical appraisal framework 
refer directly to internal validity (methodological quality), 
whereas external validity (study generalizability) was cap-
tured during screening or otherwise noted as a comment 
in the critical appraisal tool. The framework was based 
on an evaluation of the following internal validity criteria: 
study design (controlled trial or gradient of intervention 
intensity including “zero-control”, or CI), replication, 
measured outcome (quantitative, quantitative approxi-
mation, semi-quantitative), outcome metric (a metric 
related to mortality, injury, productivity, or the number 
of fish entrained), control matching (how well matched 
the intervention and comparator sites were in terms of 
habitat type at site selection and/or study initiation, and 
sampling), confounding factors [environmental or other

factors that differ between intervention and comparator 
sites and/or times, that occur after site selection and/or 
study initiation (e.g., flood, drought, unplanned human 
alteration)], and intra-treatment variation (was there 
variation within treatment and control samples). Each 
criterion was scored at a “High”, “Medium”, or “Low” 
study validity level based on the predefined framework 
outlined in Table 3. The study was given an overall “Low” 
validity if it scored low for one or more of the criteria. If 
the study did not score low for any of the criteria, it was 
assigned an overall “Medium” validity. If the study scored 
only high for all of the criteria, it was assigned an over-
all “High” validity. This approach assigns equal weight to 
each criterion, which was carefully considered during the 
development of the predefined framework. Reviewers 
did not critically appraise studies for which they were an 
author.
Study validity assessments took place at the same time 
as data extraction and were performed by two review-
ers (DAA and W. Twardek). For each study, one reviewer 
would assess study validity and extract the meta-data. 
However, a consistency check was first undertaken on 
7.8% (8/104) of articles by three reviewers (DAA, WT, 
and TR). Validity assessments and meta-data on these 
studies were extracted by all three reviewers. Before DAA 
and WT proceeded independently and on their own 
subsets of the included studies, discrepancies were dis-
cussed and, when necessary, refinements to the validity 
assessment and meta-data extraction sheets were made 
to improve clarity on coding. Reviewers did not critically 
appraise studies for which they were an author. No study 
was excluded based study validity assessments. How-
ever, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to investigate 
the influence of study validity categories (see “Sensitivity 
analyses” below).
Data coding and extraction strategy
General data‑extraction strategy
All articles included on the basis of full-text assessment, 
regardless of their study validity category, underwent 
meta-data extraction. Data extraction was undertaken 
using a review-specific data extraction form given in 
Additional file  3. Extracted information followed the 
general structure of our PICO framework (Population, 
Intervention, Comparator, Outcome) and included: 
publication details, study location and details, study 
summary, population details, intervention and compara-
tor details, outcome variables, etc. The number of fish 
injured, the number of fish killed, and the number of fish 
entrained/impinged were treated as continuous outcome 
variables. We further subgrouped the mortality outcome 
into immediate mortality (i.e., mortality was assessed 
≤ 1 h after recapture was in the tailrace i.e., immediately 
below intervention), and delayed mortality [i.e., mortal-
ity was (re)assessed > 1 h after recapture and/or recapture 
was beyond the tailrace, i.e., further downstream of inter-
vention]. Immediate mortality was used to capture the 
direct, lethal impact of the intervention, while delayed 
mortality allowed understanding of the potential indi-
rect, lethal impacts (e.g., mortality as a result of infection 
or disease following injury from intervention some time 
later). In some cases, post-passage delayed mortality can 
be indirectly attributed to factors other than the hydro-
power infrastructure itself (e.g., predation after injury). 
When explicitly reported, delayed mortality from sources 
not directly attributed to hydropower infrastructure was 
excluded at the data extraction stage. Supplementary 
articles (i.e., articles that reported data that could also be 
found elsewhere or contained portions of information 
that could be used in combination with another more 
complete source) were identified and combined with the 
most comprehensive article (i.e., primary study source) 
during data extraction (Additional file 3). Data on poten-
tial effect modifiers and other meta-data were extracted 
from the included primary study source or their supple-
mentary articles whenever available.
In addition, all included articles on the basis of full-text 
assessment, regardless of their study validity category, 
underwent quantitative data extraction. Sample size (i.e., 
total number of fish released) and outcome (number of 
fish injured, killed, or entrained/impinged), where pro-
vided, were extracted as presented from tables or within 
text. When studies reported outcomes in the form of per-
centages, we converted this metric into a number of fish 
killed or injured, when the total number of fish released 
was provided. For studies that reported survival (e.g., 
number of fish that successfully passed through inter-
vention) or detection histories from telemetry studies 
(i.e., number of detections), we converted these into the 
number of fish killed (assumed mortality) by subtract-
ing the reported response from the total number of fish 
released. For fish injury, we extracted the total num-
ber of fish injured, regardless of injury type [i.e., if data 
were provided for > 1 injury type (e.g., descaled, bruis-
ing, eye injuries, etc.) the number of fish with any injury 
was extracted]. When multiple injuries were reported 
separately, we extracted the most comprehensive data 
available for a single injury type and noted the relative 
proportions/frequencies in the data extraction form (see 
Additional file  3). For delayed mortality responses, a 
cumulative outcome value was computed (i.e., the total 
number of fish killed from the entire assessment period—
immediate time period + delayed time period). Data from 
figures were extracted using the data extraction software 
WebPlotDigitizer [37] when necessary.

Data extraction considerations
We found defining a ‘study’ in our review challenging 
as there was no clear distinction in the evidence base 
between studies and experiments (see Table  2 for defi-
nitions of terms). This was often because a single article 
could report multiple investigations within a single year 
[e.g., various changes in operational conditions (alone or 
in combination), various life stages or sources of released 
fish for the same or different species], or over multiple 
years. Often, at any one site, investigations conducted 
over multiple years could be reported within the same 
article, within different articles by the same authors, or 
by different authors in different articles (e.g., results from 
a technical report for a given time period are included 
in another publication by different authors conducting a 
similar updated study at the same site). In such cases, it 
was not always easy to discern whether the same inves-
tigations were repeated across years or whether the 
investigations were in fact changed (e.g., slight modifica-
tions in operational conditions were made). During data 
extraction, we diligently removed many duplicate sources 
of data when we were able to identify this information 
(i.e., overlapping data). However, this was an inherently 
challenging task due to the lack of detail in the study 
reports. As such, during data extraction there were a 
number of considerations made in defining our database 
of information.
Site  Each hydroelectric facility and research laboratory/
testing facility (i.e., where lab studies were conducted), 
were given a “Site ID”. If a single article reported data 
separately for different hydroelectric facilities within the 
same or different waterbodies, we regarded these data as 
independent and assigned each study a separate “Site ID”.
Study  If at a given site (i.e., hydroelectric facility or labo-
ratory), evaluations of responses were conducted for dif-
ferent: (1) operational conditions (e.g., turbine discharge, 
wicket gate opening width, dam height); (2) modifications 
of a specific intervention (e.g., number of turbine run-
ner blades); or (3) depth at fish release; we considered 
these separate studies and each were given a “Study ID”. 
We regarded these as separate studies since independent 
releases of fish were used i.e., different fish were released 
in each release trial (if more than one trial conducted) 
within each study.
If at a given site, evaluations of responses were con-
ducted for different interventions (e.g., mortality at tur-
bines and at spillways), we only considered these separate 
studies if the fish were released separately for each inter-
vention (i.e., different release points immediately above 
the intervention under evaluation, within the same or dif-
ferent years). When studies released a group of fish at a 
single location above all interventions, and the outcomes 
came from route-specific evaluations, these were consid-
ered the same study and received the same Study ID.
Data set  A single study could report separate relevant 
comparisons (i.e., multiple non-independent data sets 
that share the same Site ID) for different species, and/
or the same species but responses for different out-
comes (i.e., mortality, injury, number of fish entrained/
impinged). Furthermore, a single study could report a 
mortality response for the same species but separately for: 
(1) immediate mortality [i.e., spatial assessment was con-
ducted just after intervention (in the tailrace) and/or the 
mortality assessment was conducted ≤ 1 h after release], 
and (2) delayed mortality (i.e., spatial assessment was con-
ducted beyond the tailrace and/or the mortality assess-
ment was conducted > 1 h after release) but otherwise the 
same for all other meta-data. For quantitative synthesis, 
we treated these comparisons as separate data sets (i.e., 
separate rows in the database that share the same Site ID).
If authors reported responses for the same species for 
the same outcome category in a single study but sepa-
rately for different: (1) life stages (e.g., the mortality of 
juveniles for species A, and the mortality of adults for 
species A); and/or (2) sources of fish (i.e., hatchery, wild, 
stocked sourced) and otherwise the same for all other 
meta-data, we extracted these as separate data sets for 
the database. Furthermore, if the same study (e.g., same 
operating condition) was conducted in multiple years 
at the same site, meta-data (and quantitative data when 
available) were extracted separately for each and given 
the same Study ID. For quantitative analyses, we aggre-
gated these data sets to reduce non-independence and 
data structure complexity (see Additional file 4: Combin-
ing data across subgroups within a study).
Potential effect modifiers and reasons for heterogeneity
For all articles included on the basis of full-text assess-
ment, we recorded, when available, the following key 
sources of potential heterogeneity: site type (laboratory 
or field-based studies), intervention type [i.e., turbine, 
spillway, sluiceway, water bypass, dam, general infra-
structure, exclusionary/diversionary installations (e.g., 
screens, louvers, trash racks), and any combination of 
these interventions; see Table 1 for definitions], turbine 
type (e.g., Kaplan, Francis, S-turbine, Ossberger), hydro 
dam head height (m), fish taxa (at the genus and spe-
cies level), life stage [egg (zygotes, developing embryos, 
larvae), age-0 (fry, young-of-the-year), juvenile (age-
1), adult, mixed stages)], fish source [i.e., hatchery (fish 
raised in a hatchery environment and released into sys-
tem), wild (fish captured/released that originate from 
the source waterbody), stocked (fish captured/released 
Page 12 of 36
Algera et al. Environ Evid             (2020) 9:3 
that were from the source waterbody but originated from 
a hatchery)], sampling method [i.e., telemetry, mark-
recapture, net samples, visual, in-lab, passive integrated 
transponder tags (PIT tags)], and assessment time (h). 
Potential effect modifiers were selected with consulta-
tion with the Advisory Team. After consultation with 
the Advisory Team, there were effect modifiers that were 
originally identified in our protocol that were removed 
from data extraction for this review. Due to limitations in 
time and resources, we did not search external to the arti-
cle for life history strategies, fish body size/morphology, 
or turbine size, as they were often not reported within the 
primary articles. Also, we did not include study design or 
comparator type since there was little variation across 
these variables [(e.g., all studies either used a control 
trial or CI study design (i.e., there were no BA or BACI 
study designs]. When sufficient data were reported and 
sample size allowed, these potential modifiers were used 
in meta-analyses (see “Quantitative synthesis” below) to 
account for differences between data sets via subgroup 
analyses or meta-regression.
Data synthesis and presentation
Descriptive statistics and a narrative synthesis
All relevant studies included on the basis of full-text 
assessments, were included in a database which provides 
meta-data on each study. All meta-data were recorded in 
a MS-Excel database (Additional file 3) and were used to 
generate descriptive statistics and a narrative synthesis of 
the evidence, including figures and tables.
Quantitative synthesis
Eligibility for quantitative synthesis  Relevant studies that 
were included in the database were considered unsuit-
able for meta-analysis (and were therefore not included 
in quantitative synthesis) if any of the following applied:
•	 Quantitative outcome data were not reported for the 
intervention and/or comparator group(s);
•	 The total number of fish released was not reported 
for the intervention and/or comparator group(s);
•	 For route specific outcomes (i.e., studies that release 
a single group of fish upstream of hydroelectric 
infrastructure whereby fish can take different routes 
through/over such infrastructure), the total number 
of fish that took a specific route through hydroelec-
tric infrastructure was zero.
•	 The outcomes for both intervention and control 
groups were zero resulting in an undefined effect size 
(see “Effect size calculation” below).
•	 For both intervention and control groups, all fish 
released were killed or injured resulting in an esti-
mated sampling variance of zero (i.e., a division of 
zero in the equation to calculate typical within-study 
variance—see “Effect size calculation” below).
Quantitative synthesis—data preparation  Where zero 
values for outcomes were encountered (168 of 569 data 
sets) for either the intervention or control group, data 
were imputed by adding one to each cell in the 2 × 2 
matrix to permit calculation of the risk ratio [i.e., a value 
of one was added to each of event (number of fish killed 
or injured) or non-event (number of fish that survived 
or uninjured) cells in each of the two group] [38]. Note, 
we performed a sensitivity analysis to investigate the 
influence of the value of the imputation by comparing 
results using a smaller value of 0.5 [39, 40] (see “Sensi-
tivity analyses” below). Exceptions occurred when mor-
tality/injury were both zero for the intervention (A) and 
control group (C) within a data set (i.e., A = C = 0; risk 
ratios are undefined) (73 data sets) or when mortality/
injury were 100% for both the intervention and control 
group within a data set (4 data sets from a single study) 
[39] (see Additional file 5 Quantitative synthesis data-
base).
To reduce multiple effect sizes estimates from the same 
study—which is problematic because this would give 
studies with multiple estimates more weight in analyses—
data sets were aggregated (see Additional file  4 for full 
description) in three instances when studies reported: (1) 
responses from multiple life stages separately within the 
same outcome and intervention subgroup (e.g., mortal-
ity of species A age-0 and juveniles separately) (20 stud-
ies); (2) responses from multiple sources for fish released 
separately within the same outcome and intervention 
subgroup for the same species (e.g., mortality of species 
A hatchery reared individuals and wild sourced individu-
als separately) (8 studies); and (3) when the same study 
(e.g., same operating condition) was conducted in multi-
ple years at the same site, and all other meta-data were 
the same (22 studies).
Furthermore, there were a number of instances of mul-
tiple group comparisons whereby studies used a single 
control group and more than one treatment group within 
a single study or across studies within an article. In such 
cases, the control group was used to compute more than 
one effect size, and in consequence, the estimates of these 
effect sizes are correlated. This lack of independence 
needed to be accounted for when computing variances 
(see Additional file 4: handling dependence from multiple 
group comparisons, for a full description and the number 
of cases).

Effect size calculation  Studies primarily reported out-
comes in the form of the number of events (e.g., number 
of fish killed or injured) and non-events (e.g., number of 
fish that survived or uninjured). Thus, to conduct a meta-
analysis of the quantitative data we used risk ratio (RR) as 
an effect size metric [41]:
Risk ratios compare the risk of having an event 
(i.e., fish mortality or injury) between two groups, A 
waterbodies or simulated lab settings whereby fish 
are exposed to infrastructure associated with hydro-
electric facilities, and C waterbodies/simulated set-
tings without this intervention (control group), and 
­n1 and ­n2 were the sample sizes of group A and group 
C. If an intervention has an identical effect to the con-
trol, the risk ratio will be 1. If the chance of an effect is 
reduced by the intervention, the risk ratio will be < 1; 
if it increases the chance of having the event, the risk 
ratio will be > 1. Therefore, a risk ratio of > 1 means that 
fish are more likely to be killed or injured with passage 
through/over hydroelectric infrastructure than killed or 
injured by sources other than contact with hydroelec-
tric infrastructure.
Risk ratios were log transformed to maintain symmetry 
in the analysis, with variance calculated as [41]:
We acknowledge that risk can be expressed in both rel-
ative terms (e.g., risk ratio) as well as absolute terms [i.e., 
risk difference (RD)]. Relative risk provides a measure of 
the strength of the association between an exposure (e.g., 
fish exposed to infrastructure associated with hydroelec-
tric facilities) and an outcome (e.g., fish injury/mortal-
ity) whereas absolute risk provides the actual difference 
in the observed risk of events between intervention and 
control groups. A concern with using relative risk ratios 
is that it may obscure the magnitude of the effect of the 
intervention [42], making in some situations, the effect 
of the intervention seem worse than it actually is. For 
instance, the same risk ratio of 1.67 (i.e., the risk of fish 
mortality was 67% higher in the intervention group com-
pared to the control group) can result from two different 
scenarios, for example: (1) an increase in mortality from 
40% in the control group to 66% in the intervention group 
(i.e., RD = 24%), or (2) an increase from 3% in the con-
trol group to 5% in the intervention group (i.e., RD = 2%). 
From these examples, we can see that absolute risk (i.e., 
RD) provides insight into the actual size of a risk, and 
can, in some situations provide additional context for

hydropower managers and regulators to help inform 
their decisions. Therefore, we chose to base our quanti-
tative synthesis on pooled estimates using risk ratio as 
our effect size measure; however, to provide additional 
insight on the magnitude of risk to help inform decision 
making, we also calculated the absolute risk difference for 
individual comparisons, carried out in raw units [41]:
With variance calculated as [41]:
where B and D are the number of non-events (e.g., num-
ber of fish that survived or uninjured) for the interven-
tion and control groups, respectively. Note, only those 
studies that were considered suitable for meta-analysis 
using risk ratio were used to calculate summary effects 
using the risk difference. However, where zero values for 
outcomes were encountered for either the intervention 
or control group (as described under “Quantitative syn-
thesis—data preparation ” above), data were not imputed 
by adding a value of one (or 0.5) since this was not neces-
sary for risk difference calculations.
Quantitative synthesis—meta‑analysis  To determine 
whether fish passing through/over infrastructure associ-
ated with hydroelectric facilities increased, on average, the 
risk of mortality or injury compared to controls, we first 
conducted random-effects meta-analyses using restricted 
maximum-likelihood (REML) to compute weighted aver-
age risk ratios for each outcome separately [i.e., injury 
(k = 104 effect sizes), immediate mortality (k = 162), and 
delayed mortality (k = 256)]. In each model, data from 
all intervention types and all temperate freshwater fish 
were combined. To further account for multiple data sets 
from the same study site (i.e., different studies or species), 
Study ID nested within Site ID was considered a random 
factor in each analysis. All summary effects (and associ-
ated 95% confidence intervals) were converted back to, 
and reported as, risk ratios [i.e., RR = exp(LogRiskRatio)]. 
Heterogeneity in effects was calculated using the Q sta-
tistic, which was compared against the χ2 distribution, to 
test whether the total variation in observed effect sizes 
(QT) was significantly greater than that expected from 
sampling error (QE) [43]. A larger Q indicates greater 
heterogeneity in effects sizes (i.e., individual effect sizes 
do not estimate a common population mean), suggesting 
there are differences among effect sizes that have some 
cause other than sampling error. We also produced for-
est plots to visualize mean effect sizes and 95% confidence

intervals from individual comparisons. Mean effect sizes 
were considered statistically significant if their confidence 
intervals did not include an RR = 1. We also analyzed the 
impacts of fish entrainment and impingement associated 
with hydroelectric dams separately on outcomes for the 
select few taxonomic groups (at the genus and species 
level) when there were sufficient sample size to do so.
As risk ratios may not be easily interpretable, we also 
calculated the percent relative effect (i.e., the percent 
change in the treatment group), whereby the control 
group was regarded as having a 100% baseline risk and 
the treatment group was expressed relative to the control: 
% increase (when RR > 1) = (RR − 1) × 100. For example, 
fish passing through turbines had a 320% increase in risk 
of mortality versus the risk of mortality in control fish 
released downstream of any hydroelectric infrastructure 
(100%). Also, as noted above, to provide additional con-
text on the magnitude of risk, we report weighted average 
absolute risk differences, estimated following the same 
methods outlined in the paragraph immediately above as 
for estimating weighted average risk ratios. Because com-
plex analyses beyond estimating summary effects using 
the risk difference are not recommended (i.e., investigat-
ing heterogeneity with moderators e.g., meta-regression) 
[38], we accompany pooled risk ratios with pooled abso-
lute risk differences and 95% confidence intervals for 
main summary effects only (i.e., for each outcome, inter-
vention type, and genus separately).
We examined the robustness of our models by ana-
lyzing for publication biases in two ways. First, we used 
visual assessments of funnel plots (i.e., scatter plots of 
the effect sizes of the included studies versus a measure 
of their precision e.g., sample size, standard error, or 
sampling variance) [44]. Here, we produced funnel plots 
using 1/standard error. In the absence of publication bias, 
the funnel plot should resemble an inverted funnel. In the 
presence of publication bias, some smaller (less precise) 
studies with smaller effect sizes will be absent resulting in 
an asymmetrical funnel plot [45]. Second, we used Egg-
er’s regression test to provide more quantitative examina-
tions of funnel plot asymmetry [46].
To test for associations between effect size and moder-
ators, we used mixed-effects models for categorical mod-
erators and meta-regression for continuous moderators, 
estimating heterogeneity using REML. We first evalu-
ated the influence of intervention type on each outcome 
subgroup separately. Then, we tested for associations 
between other moderators (i.e., turbine type, hydro dam 
head height, site type, life stage, fish source, sampling 
method, assessment time) and effect sizes within inter-
vention type subsets. We tested for associations within 
intervention subsets for two reasons. First, many mod-
erators of interest were related to specific intervention 
types (e.g., turbine type, hydro dam head height). To 
reduce potential confounding effect of intervention type, 
associations between other moderators and effect sizes 
were evaluated separately for different interventions. 
Second, since information on all moderators was not 
always provided in articles (e.g., assessment time was not 
reported in all studies) and the distribution of modera-
tors varied substantially between intervention types, we 
removed effect sizes with missing information and tested 
for associations within intervention type subsets.
Before examining the influence of moderators within 
intervention subsets, we made the following modifica-
tions to our coding to reduce the number of studies we 
needed to exclude. First, since there was only a single case 
where juveniles and adult life stages were used together, 
we added this category to the mixed life stage category 
(applicable for the immediate mortality analysis only). 
Second, we combined studies that used mark-recapture 
sampling gear and methods (e.g., fin clips, balloon tags, 
or PIT tags for identification only, with or without net-
ting) with netting alone methods (e.g., a known number 
of unmarked fish were released and recaptured in net-
ting downstream of intervention(s)) into a single category 
(i.e., recapture). For studies that used telemetry (radio, 
acoustic, or PIT tags for remote tracking) either alone 
or in combination with any other category, we combined 
them into a single category (i.e., telemetry). Third, assess-
ment time was categorized into three time periods: (1) 
< 24 h; (2) ≥ 24–48 h; and (3) > 48 h. Fourth, we included 
data sets that evaluated impacts of turbines + trash racks 
into the turbine intervention category (for immediate fish 
mortality only).
We conducted χ2 tests to assess independence of mod-
erators for each intervention separately. When mod-
erators within an intervention subset were confounded, 
and/or the distribution between moderator categories 
was uneven, we avoided these problems by constructing 
independent subsets of data in a hierarchical approach. 
For example, within the immediate mortality outcome 
subgroup, there were no wild sourced fish used in studies 
conducted in a lab setting; therefore, the influence of fish 
source on effect size was investigated within the subset of 
field-based studies only.
Where there was sufficient sample size within each of 
the subsets to include a moderator, we included the mod-
erator into the model individually, and in combination 
when possible. We restricted the number of fitted param-
eters (j) in any model such that the ratio k/j, where k is 
the number of effect sizes, was > 5, which is sufficient in 
principle to ensure reasonable model stability and suf-
ficient precision of coefficients [47]. Selection between 
the models (including the null model, i.e., a random-
effects model with no moderator) was evaluated using 
Page 15 of 36
Algera et al. Environ Evid             (2020) 9:3 
sample-size-corrected Akaike Information Criterion 
­(AICc) (i.e., based on whether the mixed-effects model(s) 
had a lower ­AICc than the null model) and accompanied 
by corresponding QE (test statistic of residual heterogene-
ity) and QM (heterogeneity explained by the model). The 
statistical significance of QM and QE were tested against a 
χ2 distribution. We only performed analyses on categori-
cal moderators where there were sufficient combinable 
data sets (i.e., > 2 data sets from ≥ 2 sites). Thus, in some 
cases, we either combined similar categories to increase 
the sample size (detailed in results below) or deleted the 
categories that did not meet the sample size criteria. The 
single continuous moderator variable, hydro dam head 
height, was log-transformed to meet test assumptions.
Sensitivity analyses  Sensitivity analyses were carried out 
to investigate the influence of: (1) study validity catego-
ries; (2) imputing data (i.e., a value of one) to each cell in 
the matrix to permit calculation of the risk ratio where 
zero values for outcomes were encountered; (3) imputing 
a different value (i.e., 0.5) to each cell in the matrix to per-
mit calculation of the risk ratio where zero values for out-
comes were encountered; (4) multiple group comparisons 
where a single control group was compared to more than 
one intervention type within the same study and outcome 
subgroup, and (5) converting studies that reported sur-
vival (e.g., number of fish that successfully passed through 
intervention) or detection histories from telemetry stud-
ies (i.e., number of detections) into the number of fish 
killed (assumed mortality). First, models were fit using 
just those studies assessed as being “Medium” or “High” 
validity. Given that there were only two criteria for which 
a “Medium” score could be applied, and the relatively 
small differences between a “Medium” and “High” score 
for these criteria, we merged these two categories for the 
sensitivity analysis i.e., we assigned an overall “Medium/
High” category all studies that did not score low for any 
criteria. Second, separate models were fit using only those 
studies that did not require computational adjustments 
during initial data preparation. Third, separate mod-
els were fit using all data sets calculated from imputing 
a value of 0.5 rather than one for risk ratios where zero 
values for outcomes were encountered. Fourth, separate 
models were fit using data sets that did not include multi-
ple group comparisons. Lastly, models were fit using only 
those studies that did not require a conversion from fish 
survival or detection to assumed mortality by subtract-
ing the reported response from the total number of fish 
released (only applicable for immediate and delayed mor-
tality outcomes). In all five sets of analyses, the results 
were compared to the overall model fit to examine differ-
ences in pooled effect sizes. All meta-analyses were con-
ducted in R 3.4.3 [48] using the rma.mv function in the 
metafor package [49].
Review findings
Review descriptive statistics
Literature searches and screening
Searching five databases and Google Scholar resulted 
in finding 3121 individual records, of which 2418 arti-
cles remained after duplicate removal (Fig.  1). Title 
and abstract screening removed 1861 articles, leaving 
557 articles for full-text screening. Full-text screening 
removed 418 articles, and 32 articles were unobtain-
able due to either insufficient citation information pro-
vided within the search hit, or they could not be located 
through internet, library, or inter-library loan sources. 
Unobtainable articles and articles excluded at full-text 
screening are listed with an exclusion decision in Addi-
tional file 2. A total of 107 articles were included for data 
extraction from database and Google Scholar searches. 
Screening bibliographies of relevant reviews identified 
at title and abstract or full-text screening resulted in an 
additional 99 articles included (~ 85% of which were grey 
literature sources that were not picked up by our data-
base searches e.g., government reports, and theses). Full-
text screening of grey literature sources from website 
searches and submissions via social media/email resulted 
in no additional articles for data extraction.
A total of 206 articles were initially included for data 
extraction. During data extraction, one article was 
excluded for an irrelevant intervention and 89 articles 
were excluded for having an impact-only study design 
(i.e., treatment-only, no comparator; Fig.  1 and Addi-
tional file 2). Further, 29 articles were identified as having 
overlapping data and/or projects (listed as Supplemen-
tary Articles in Additional file 3), resulting in a total of 87 
articles with 264 studies included in the narrative synthe-
sis. Of these, 75 articles with 222 studies were included in 
quantitative synthesis.
Sources of articles used for data extraction
A total of 60 grey literature (i.e., government/consultant 
reports, conference proceedings, book chapters) and 27 
commercially published articles published throughout 
1952–2016 were included for data extraction and qual-
ity assessment (Fig.  2). Grey literature accounted for a 
higher frequency of included articles in all decades with 
the exception of the current decade. Grey and com-
mercially published literature published between 2000 
and 2009 represented the greatest proportion of articles 
(29%), followed by those published in the 1990s (23%) 
and the 1980s (16%).

Study validity assessment
Validity assessments were conducted for 128 individual 
projects identified from the 264 studies included (Addi-
tional file 6). Over half of the projects were assigned an 
overall “Low” validity (53%), whereas projects assigned 
overall “High” and “Medium” validity accounted for 
30% and 17%, respectively. All projects critically 
appraised employed a CI design. Most projects (93%) 
reported quantitative data on fish mortality/injury 
relative to an appropriate control (98%) and satisfied 
the various performance bias criteria (Table  4). How-
ever, many projects were assigned a “High” ranking

in one (or several) categories, but many of these pro-
jects received a “Low” ranking for confounding sam-
pling, habitat, and environmental factors, consequently 
resulting in the increased proportion of overall “Low” 
ranked projects (see Table  4; Additional file  6). For 
example, a project assessed as meeting the criteria for 
a “High” ranking with exception of receiving a “Low” 
ranking in performance and sample bias because there 
was heterogeneity within treatment and control sam-
ples (e.g., environmental conditions or operating condi-
tions varied during turbine releases).
The frequencies of overall “High”, “Medium”, and “Low” 
ranked studies varied over time (Fig. 3). The 1960s, 1990s, 
and 2000–2009 decades produced the most “High” and 
“Medium” ranked studies, and “High” and “Medium” 
ranked studies accounted for most of the studies con-
ducted in these decades (77%, 75%, and 62%, respec-
tively). The 1980s, 2000–2009, and 2010–2016 decades 
produced the most overall “Low” ranked studies. Within 
the 1970s, 1980s and 2010–2016, “Low” ranked stud-
ies accounted for most of the studies conducted in these 
decades (75%, 71%, and 75%, respectively).

Narrative synthesis
The narrative synthesis was based on 264 studies from 87 
articles. Descriptive meta-data, coding, and quantitative 
data extracted from these studies can be found in Addi-
tional file 3.
Study location
Studies included in the narrative were conducted in five 
countries in the north temperate zone and two countries 
in the south temperate zone. The vast majority of studies 
were conducted in North America (97%), with the United 
States (93%) and Canada (4%) accounting for the high-
est and second highest number of studies. The remain-
ing 3% of studies were conducted in European (France, 
Germany, Sweden) and Oceania (Australia and New Zea-
land) regions. Most studies were field based (75%), con-
ducted at 46 sites (i.e., dams), with most sites located in 
the United States (78%; Table 5). Lab studies, conducted 
at four research centers based in the United States, 
accounted for 24% of the studies.
Population
Mortality/injury from entrainment/impingement was 
investigated in 35 species spanning 24 genera and 15 
families (Fig. 4). The majority of studies were conducted 
on the Salmonidae family from genera Oncorhynchus 
(259 studies), Salmo (6 studies), and Salvelinus (6 stud-
ies). Anadromous fish represented just under 30% of the 
species included in the narrative but accounted for the 
bulk of the studies. Numerous resident (47% of species 
studied) and other migratory species (e.g., catadromous, 
potamodromous, 26% of species studied) were included 
but contributed far fewer studies. The most frequently 
studied species were Pacific salmonids (Oncorhynchus 
spp.) including Chinook Salmon (O. tshawytscha, 142 
studies), Rainbow Trout/steelhead (O. mykiss, 76 stud-
ies), and Coho Salmon (O. kisutch, 42 studies). The most 
common non-salmonid species studied were American 
Shad (Alosa sapidissima, 11 studies), Pacific Lamprey 
(Entosphenus tridentatus, 10 studies), Bluegill (Lepomis 
macrochirus, 9 studies) American Eel (Anguilla rostrata, 
6 studies), and Blueback Herring (Alosa aestivalis, 5 stud-
ies). Most species (25 species) contributed < 5 studies.
Most studies were conducted on juvenile fish (e.g., 
yearlings, smolts, 224 studies; Fig. 5). Hatchery and wild 
juvenile fish (179 and 34 studies, respectively) were the 
most commonly studied. Wild fish accounted for most 
studies of adult fish (8 of 10 studies), and very few studies 
were conducted on larval stages (3 studies).
Intervention
Fish entrainment/impingement was studied for a vari-
ety of hydropower intervention types including turbines, 
spillways, bypasses, and exclusionary/diversionary instal-
lations (e.g., screens, louvers, trash racks). The most com-
mon intervention type studied was turbines (173 studies), 
followed by spillways (34 studies; Fig.  6). The “general” 
intervention type (i.e., where specific infrastructure was 
not isolated but entrainment/impingement was attributa-
ble to hydropower infrastructure) accounted for 33 stud-
ies. Intervention types included in the narrative but not 
commonly studied in isolation were exclusionary/diver-
sionary installations, the dam, fish ladders, and outlet 
works. Some studies applied an intervention in combina-
tion with one or more other interventions. A combina-
tion of interventions (e.g., turbine and trash rack, spillway 
and removable weir) was used in six turbine studies, eight 
spillway studies, and seven bypass studies.
Several turbine types were studied, with Kaplan tur-
bines being the most common (81 studies) followed 
by Francis turbines (41 studies) (Fig. 7). Other turbines 
[Advanced Hydro Turbine System (AHTS), bulb, S-tur-
bine, and Ossberger] were used in six studies. Very low 
head (VLH) hydraulic and rim-drive turbines were only 
used in a single study each. Pressure chambers that sim-
ulate passage through Kaplan or Francis turbines were 
used in 14 studies.
Study design and comparator
All 264 studies from the 87 articles included in the narra-
tive used a CI design. Impact-only articles (i.e., those with 
no comparator; I-only) were included at full text screen-
ing but excluded during data extraction (89 articles; see 
Additional file  3). Some articles included both CI and 
I-only datasets; I-only datasets were removed during data 
extraction.
Comparator types included fish released downstream 
of an intervention (e.g., tailrace releases), and handling/
holding (e.g., fish handled and placed into a holding 
tank). Downstream comparators, the most frequently 
used comparators, were most commonly used in field-
based studies (194 studies). Only 15 field studies used 
handling/holding comparators, whereas all lab-based 
studies used handling/holding comparators (70 studies).
Outcomes
The most frequently reported measured outcome was 
mortality (252 studies). Injury was reported in 128 stud-
ies, and number of fish entrained/impinged was reported 
in 3 studies. Delayed mortality (210 studies) was more 
frequently reported than immediate mortality (assessed 
< 1 h after recapture; 159 studies). Mark-recapture sam-
pling gear and methods (e.g., nets, fin clips) were the 
most frequently used for assessing mortality (114 stud-
ies) and injury (44 studies) compared to tagging gear 
(e.g., telemetry) which was used in 21 and 15 studies for

mortality and injury assessment, respectively. The most 
common injury type reported was descaling. When not 
specified, injuries were reported as mechanical, pres-
sure, shear, major or minor. Lab studies most frequently 
investigated barotrauma injuries. For relative proportions 
of injury types reported in the studies see Additional 
file 3. Delayed mortality assessment time varied from 2 h 
to several days. Delayed mortality was most frequently 
assessed between 24 and 48 h (91 studies) or greater than 
48 h (66 studies; Fig. 8). Injury assessment time also var-
ied but was typically assessed within 48 h.
Quantitative synthesis
Description of the data
Of the 264 studies (from 87 articles) included in the nar-
rative synthesis, 222 studies (from 75 articles) with 522 
data sets after aggregation were included in developing 
our quantitative synthesis database (Additional file 5).
Of the 522 data sets used in Global meta-analyses 
below, 55% were assessed as having ‘High’ overall validity, 
12% as having ‘Medium’ overall validity, and 33% as ‘Low’ 
overall validity.
Data sets included in the quantitative synthesis were 
largely from North America (494), predominately from 
USA (475 of 494 data sets), followed by some from Oce-
ania (18) and Europe (10). The majority of studies were 
field-based studies in rivers (72% of data sets), and the 
remaining were lab-based studies conducted in research 
facilities (28%).
Among the 522 data sets, 104 data sets reported fish 
injuries, 162 data sets reported immediate fish mortal-
ity, and 256 reported delayed fish mortality (Table 6). The 
majority of studies on the impacts of fish entrainment 
and impingement were evaluations of turbines (67% of 
data sets), followed by general infrastructure, spillways, 
and turbines with trash racks (9%, 7%, and 6% of data sets

respectively; Table 6). For all other interventions, impacts 
on fish responses were evaluated in ≤ 5% of data sets 
(Table 6).
Within the quantitative synthesis database, 31 spe-
cies from 22 genera and 14 families were evaluated for 
impacts of fish entrainment and impingement. The most 
commonly evaluated species were from the Salmonidae 
family and included Chinook Salmon (203 data sets), 
Rainbow Trout/steelhead (133), and Coho Salmon (52).
Studies reporting outcomes using juveniles (age 1 to 
smolt) as the life stage made up the largest portion (82.3% 
of data sets), whereas all other life stages were evalu-
ated less frequently (eggs, age 0, age 0 + juveniles, juve-
niles + adults, adults, and mixed life stages, made up 3%, 
4%, 2%, 0.2%, 3%, and 6% of data sets, respectively).
Fish used in study evaluations of intervention impacts 
were primarily sourced from hatcheries (77% of data 
sets), followed by wild, mixed (i.e., a mixture of wild and 
hatchery), and stocked sourced fish (16%, 4%, and 2% of 
data sets, respectively).
Information on the type of turbine used in evalua-
tions was reported in 89% of turbine data sets, with 
the majority being Kaplan (43% of data sets) and Fran-
cis (37% of data sets) turbines. Hydro dam head height 
was reported in 54% of data sets involving spillways and 
ranged from 15.2 to 91.4 m.
Various sampling methods were used to evaluate fish 
responses to interventions. All lab-based studies used 
visual methods (134 data sets), though some included 
mark-recapture methods (e.g., use of PIT tags for fish 
identification only; 13 data sets). For field-based stud-
ies, the majority used mark-recapture sampling gear 
and methods (e.g., fin clips, balloon tags, or PIT tags 
for identification only, with or without netting; 224 data 
sets) or telemetry methods (e.g., acoustic, radio, or PIT

tags used for remote tracking; 115 data sets). Netting 
alone was also used but less frequently (36 data sets).
Information on the assessment time for evaluating 
fish responses was reported in 84% of the data sets. 
Most data sets were short-term evaluations of the 
impacts of fish entrainment and impingement on fish 
responses, with 46% of the available data sets report-
ing assessment times < 24 h after fish were released. We 
found data sets reporting longer-term evaluations, with 
32% of the available data sets reporting fish responses 
within ≥ 24–48 h after fish were released, and 22% of 
data sets reported data more than 48 h after fish were 
released.
Global meta‑analyses
Fish injury  The pooled risk ratio for fish injury was 3.17 
(95% CI 1.74, 5.78; Fig. 9, Table 7A, and Additional file 7: 
Figure S1) indicating an overall increase in risk of fish 
injuries with passage through/over hydroelectric infra-
structure relative to controls (i.e., 217% increase in risk 
over and above the risk in the control group). The forest 
plot for this meta-analysis suggested that a large number 
of cases (85 of 104 data sets) showed increased chances 
of fish injury relative to controls (i.e., 82% of studies had 
RRs > 1), with many of these individual comparisons being 
statistically significant (53 out of 85 cases had confidence 
intervals that did not include 1; Additional file 7: Figure

fish injury or mortality with passage through/over hydroelectric infrastructure relative to controls; green indicates an overall average decrease in 
risk of fish injury or mortality with passage through/over hydroelectric infrastructure relative to controls. k: number of data sets (i.e., effect sizes); RR:

S1). The Q test for heterogeneity suggested that there 
was substantial variation in effect sizes (Q = 2796.31, 
p < 0.0001). There was no obvious pattern of publication 
bias in either the funnel plot of asymmetry, or the Egger’s 
regression test (z = 0.31, p = 0.741; Additional file 7: Fig-
ure S2).
The sensitivity analysis for medium/high validity stud-
ies indicated a higher pooled risk ratio compared to the 
overall meta-analysis [RR = 4.15 (95% CI 2.42, 7.11), 
k = 72, p < 0.0001], suggesting that this result may not 
be robust to differences in study validity as assessed by 
critical appraisal, i.e., higher validity studies may result 
in higher risk ratio estimates (Additional file  7: Figure 
S3). Studies that did not require zero cell adjustments, as 
well as studies that did not include multiple group com-
parisons had similar results to the overall meta-analy-
sis; [RR = 2.61 (95% CI 1.57, 4.33), k = 71, p = 0.0002; 
RR = 3.68 (95% CI 2.12, 6.39), k = 102, p < 0.0001, respec-
tively]. Furthermore, using a value of 0.5 for zero cell 
adjustments yielded similar results to the overall meta-
analysis using a data imputation of one [RR = 3.31 (95% 
CI 1.83, 5.99), k = 104, p < 0.0001]. These sensitivity anal-
yses suggested that this result may be robust to computa-
tional adjustments made in initial data preparation, and 
the inclusion of a single study that compared two inter-
vention types with a single control group (Additional 
file 7: Figures S4–S6).
Immediate fish mortality  The pooled risk ratio for 
immediate mortality was 3.35 (95% CI 2.38, 4.69; Fig. 9 
and Table 7A), indicating an overall increase in risk of fish 
mortality immediately following passage through/over 
hydroelectric infrastructure relative to controls (i.e., 235% 
Table 7  Summary statistics from main analyses based on the risk ratio (RR) and the risk difference (RD)
For RR, % increase risk was calculated as the percent relative effect (when RR > 1) = (RR − 1) × 100. For RD, % increase risk was calculated as the percent absolute 
effect = RD*100. Note, a decrease in the risk of fish injury/mortality from passage over/through hydroelectric infrastructure compared to control groups is indicated by 
a value of < 1 for RR and < 0 for RD. k: number of data sets (i.e., effect sizes); CI: 95% confidence intervals

increase in risk over and above the risk in the control 
group). The forest plot for this meta-analysis suggested 
that 90% of studies (145 of 162) showed increased chances 
of fish mortality relative to controls (i.e., RRs > 1), with 
many of these studies having significant effect sizes (106 
out of 145 cases) (Additional file 7: Figure S7). However, 
the Q test for heterogeneity suggested that there was sig-
nificant heterogeneity between effect sizes (Q = 11,684.88, 
p < 0.0001). Funnel plots of asymmetry suggested pos-
sible evidence of publication bias towards studies show-
ing increased chances of fish mortality relative to controls 
(Additional file 7: Figures S8, S9). Egger’s regression test 
further supported this assessment (z = 4.58, p < 0.0001). 
Removing two outliers did not improve bias estimates 
(z = 4.51, p < 0.0001). Interestingly, when separating com-
mercially published studies from grey literature studies, 
evidence of publication bias was only present in the lat-
ter (z = 0.74, p = 0.458, k = 18, and z = 4.65, p < 0.0001, 
k = 144, respectively).
The meta-analysis based only on medium/high valid-
ity studies had a similar result to the overall meta-anal-
ysis [RR = 3.26 (95% CI 2.25, 4.73); k = 123, p < 0.0001], 
suggesting that this result may be robust to differences 
in study validity (Additional file 7: Figure S10). Further-
more, no evidence of bias was apparent from sensitivity 
analysis of studies that did not require computational 
adjustments in initial data preparation [RR = 3.03 (95% 
CI 2.08, 4.40); k = 108, p < 0.0001], as well as stud-
ies that did not include multiple group comparisons 
[RR = 3.01 (95% CI 2.17, 4.16); k = 155, p < 0.0001; 
Additional file 7: Figures S11, S12]. We could not obtain 
a pooled risk ratio using a value of 0.5 for zero cell 
adjustments due to instability of model results, because 
the ratio of the largest to smallest sampling variance 
was very large. The analysis based on studies that did 
not require a conversion from fish survival or detection 
to assumed mortality showed a higher pooled risk ratio 
compared to the overall meta-analysis [RR = 4.52 (95% 
CI 3.08, 6.63), k = 119, p < 0.0001]. Thus, this result may 
not be robust to conversions made to outcome metrics 
i.e., studies that measure actual fish mortality, instead 
of inferred mortality from survival estimates or detec-
tion histories, may result in higher risk ratio estimates 
(Additional file 7: Figure S13).
Delayed fish mortality  A pooled risk ratio for delayed 
fish mortality was not obtained due to instability of model 
results, because the ratio of the largest to smallest sam-
pling variance was very large. Model instability also pre-
cluded our ability to test for associations between pooled 
risk ratios for delayed fish mortality and moderators.
Effects of moderators on fish injury
To address the question, to what extent does interven-
tion type influence the impact of fish entrainment and 
impingement, there were only sufficient sample sizes 
(i.e., > 2 data sets from ≥ 2 sites) to include the follow-
ing interventions for fish injury: (1) Turbines; (2) General 
infrastructure; (3) Bypasses; and (4) Spillways (Fig. 9).
Intervention type was associated with pooled risk 
ratios (Table 8A), with spillways and turbines associated 
with higher risk ratios than general infrastructure and 
water bypasses for fish injury (792% and 406% increase 
vs. 250% increase and 82% decrease, respectively; Figs. 9 
and 10, and Table 7B).
Turbines  There were only sufficient sample sizes and 
variation to permit meaningful tests of the influence of 
the following moderators: (1) Site type; (2) Fish source; 
(3) Assessment time. None of the factors were found to be 
confounded (Additional file 8: Table S1A).
Site type was associated with average risk ratios 
(Table 8B), with studies conducted in a lab setting asso-
ciated with higher risk ratios than field-based studies 
relative to controls (718% vs. 182% increase, respectively; 
Figs.  9 and 11). Assessment time was marginally asso-
ciated with average risk ratios (Table  8B), with longer 
assessment time periods (≥ 24–48  h) associated with 
higher risk ratios than shorter duration assessment peri-
ods (< 24 h) (890% vs. 268% increase, respectively; Figs. 9 
and 11). No detectable association was found between 
fish source and average effect sizes. The model including 
both site type and assessment time was more informa-
tive than any univariate model (Table 8B). However, there 
was still significant heterogeneity remaining in all moder-
ated models (Table 8B).
General infrastructure  For the quantitative synthesis, 
“general infrastructure” primarily included studies that 
simulated the effects of shear pressure during fish passage 
through turbines, spillways, and other infrastructure in a 
lab setting (e.g., [51, 52]). There was only sufficient sample 
size within life stage (eggs or juveniles) and assessment 
time (≥ 24–48 or > 48 h) to investigate the influence of 
modifiers on the impact of general infrastructure for fish 
injury. We only found a detectable association with aver-
age effect sizes and life stage (Table 8C), with the juve-
nile life stage associated with higher risk ratios than the 
egg life stage relative to controls (312% vs. 9% increase, 
respectively; Figs. 9 and 12).
Bypasses  The influence of factors was not investigated 
owing to inadequate sample sizes (Fig. 9).
Page 25 of 36
Algera et al. Environ Evid             (2020) 9:3 
Spillways  The influence of factors was not investigated 
owing to inadequate sample sizes (Fig. 9). The majority of 
spillway studies included chute and freefall designs and 
tended to focus on enumerating mortality rather than 
injury.

Effects of moderators on Immediate fish mortality
To address the question, to what extent does interven-
tion type influence the impact of fish entrainment and 
impingement, there were only sufficient sample sizes 
(i.e., > 2 data sets from ≥ 2 sites) to include the following 
interventions for immediate mortality: (1) Turbines; (2) 
General infrastructure; (3) Bypasses; (4) Spillways, and 
(5) Sluiceways (Fig. 9).
Intervention type was associated with pooled risk 
ratios for immediate fish mortality (Table 9A), with gen-
eral infrastructure, turbines, and sluiceways associated 
with higher risk ratios than spillways and water bypasses 
(371%, 283%, and 261% increase vs. 101 and 11% increase, 
respectively) (Figs. 9 and 13, and Table 7B).
Turbines  There were only sufficient sample sizes to per-
mit meaningful tests of the influence of the following fac-
tors: (1) Site type; (2) Source; (3) Life stage; and (4) Sam-
pling method. Due to uneven distributions between fish 
source and sampling method categories, the influence of 
fish source and sampling method on effect size was inves-
tigated within the subset of field-based studies only (see 
below).
Site type was associated with average risk ratios 
(Table  9B), with lab-based studies having higher risk 
ratios than to field-based studies (1776% vs. 247% 
increase, respectively) (Figs.  9 and 14). No detectable 
association was found between life stage and average risk

ratios (Table 9B). There was still significant heterogeneity 
remaining in all moderated models (Table 9B).
Within the subset of field-based turbine studies, there 
were adequate sample sizes to evaluate the influence of 
turbine type, sampling method, and fish source. Due 
to uneven distributions within sampling methods and 
fish source for different turbine types (i.e., there was no 
telemetry sampling methods or wild sourced fish used 
with Francis turbines) (Additional file  8: Table  S2B), 
the influence of sampling method and fish source was 
evaluated within Kaplan turbines only (below). How-
ever, within the field-based subset, there was a detect-
able association between turbine type and average risk 
ratios (Table  9C), with Francis turbines having higher 
risk ratios than Kaplan turbines (522 vs. 144% increase, 
respectively; Figs. 9 and 15a).
For the subset of Kaplan turbine studies, the magni-
tude of immediate mortality responses to turbines rela-
tive to controls varied with fish source (Table 9D), with 
wild sourced fish having higher risk ratios than hatchery 
sourced fish (Figs. 9; 15b). No detectable association was 
found between sampling method and average risk ratios 
(Table 9B). A model including fish source and sampling 
method was only slightly more informative than the uni-
variate model including fish source (Table 9D).

Sluiceways  The influence of factors was not investigated 
owing to inadequate sample sizes (Fig. 9).
Spillways  The influence of factors was not investigated 
owing to inadequate sample sizes (Fig. 9). Although small 
sample sizes precluded testing potential reasons for vari-
ation in fish mortality from spillways, other variables not 
tested in our analyses such as spillway height and design, 
use of energy dissipators, downstream water depth, and 
presence of rock outcrops at the base of the spillway out-
flow are known to be important for spillway related mor-
tality [53, 54].
Taxonomic analyses
There were only sufficient sample sizes to investigate 
impacts of hydroelectric infrastructure on outcomes of 
five temperate freshwater fish genera: (1) Alosa (river 
herring; injury, immediate and delayed mortality out-
comes); (2) Anguilla (freshwater eels; delayed mortality 
only); (3) Lepomis (sunfish; injury only); (4) Salmo (Atlan-
tic Salmon Salmo salar; delayed mortality only); and (5) 
Oncorhynchus (Pacific salmon and trout; injury, immedi-
ate and delayed mortality outcomes). Forest plots for all 
analyses are presented in Additional file 9.
Alosa  Overall, there was a similar increase in risk 
of injury and immediate mortality following passage 
through/over hydroelectric infrastructure relative to con-
trols for river herrings (127% and 144% increase in risk 
over and above the risk in the control group, respectively) 
(Fig. 16a, b, and Table 7C). In contrast, there was no statis-
tically significant effect of delayed mortality for this group 
(Fig. 16c and Table 7C). In all outcomes, either all or the 
majority of the data sets were from turbine studies (i.e., 
injury: all data sets; immediate mortality: 11 of 12; delay 
mortality: 7 of 9). Sample sizes were too small to evalu-
ate the influence of moderator variables within outcome 
subsets for this genus.
Anguilla  For freshwater eels, the overall risk of delayed 
mortality following passage through/over hydroelec-
tric infrastructure was high relative to controls (1275% 
increase in risk over and above the risk in the control 
group; Fig. 16c and Table 7C). Two species of freshwater 
eels were represented, European (Anguilla anguilla) and 
American (Anguilla rostrata) eels, with 80% of the indi-
vidual comparisons using adult eels and focusing on tur-
bine impacts. Sample sizes were too small in this group 
as well to evaluate the influence of moderator variables 
within outcome subsets for this genus.
Lepomis  For sunfish, there was sufficient data available 
to evaluate the impact of turbines on injury. There was no 
statistically significant effect of turbines on sunfish injury 
as a whole (Fig. 16a, and Table 7C).
Salmo  There was adequate data available to evaluate the 
impact of turbines on delayed mortality with all compari-
sons representing a single species, the Atlantic Salmon. 
We found no overall significant effect of turbines on 
Atlantic Salmon mortality (Fig. 16c and Table 7C), with 
evident variation in delayed mortality responses (i.e., large 
upper confidence interval).
Oncorhynchus  Within the Pacific salmon and trout 
group, there was a similar overall increase in risk of injury 
and immediate mortality following passage through/over 
hydroelectric infrastructure relative to controls (323% and 
237% increase in risk over and above the risk in the con-
trol group, respectively; Fig. 16a and b, and Table 7C). A 
pooled risk ratio for delayed mortality was not obtained 
for this group of fish due to instability of model results.
Intervention type was associated with pooled risk 
ratios for both injury and immediate mortality outcomes 
(QM= 40.66, p < 0.0001, k = 43; QM= 10,881, p < 0.0001, 
k = 125, respectively). Spillways and turbines were associ-
ated with higher risk ratios than water bypasses for injury 
(1241% and 613% increase vs. 80% decrease, respectively; 
Fig.  16d), and immediate mortality (260% and 261% 
increase vs. 225% increase, respectively; Fig. 16e). How-
ever, there was still significant heterogeneity remaining 
in moderated models (QE= 1869.55, p < 0.0001, k = 43; 
QE= 214.69, p < 0.0001, k = 125, respectively). Further-
more, although pooled risk ratios for both spillways and 
turbines were significant (i.e., 95% CIs did not overlap 
with 1) in both outcome subsets, upper confidence inter-
vals were large for injury responses, indicating substantial 
variation in the magnitude of negative injury responses 
among individual comparisons. To further explore rea-
sons for heterogeneity in responses, we tested the influ-
ence of species type on effect sizes within the turbine 
subset of studies for all outcome subsets (i.e., the inter-
vention with the largest sample size to permit meaningful 
analyses). No detectable association was found between 
species [i.e., Rainbow Trout and Chinook Salmon] and 
average risk ratios for Pacific salmon and trout injury 
(QM= 1.63, p = 0.201, k = 33). However, species was asso-
ciated with average risk ratios for immediate mortality 
(QM= 89.93, p < 0.0001, k = 97), with studies on Rainbow 
Trout associated with higher risk ratios than either Coho 
or Chinook salmon to controls (539% vs. 279%, and 246% 
increase in risk over and above the risk in the control 
group, respectively; Fig. 17a).
Within Pacific salmon and trout species subsets for 
immediate mortality responses to turbines, there were 
sufficient samples sizes to investigate the influence of 
Page 29 of 36

the following moderators: (1) turbine type within field 
studies for both Coho and Chinook salmon; (2) sam-
pling method within Kaplan turbine types for Chinook 
Salmon; and (3) site type for Rainbow Trout.
Coho Salmon: Within the field-based subset, a detect-
able association was found between turbine type and 
average risk ratios (QM= 4.14, p = 0.042, k = 10), with 
Francis turbines having a much higher pooled risk ratio 
than Kaplan turbines relative to controls (1658 vs. 285% 
increase, respectively; Fig. 17b). There was little variation 
among data sets with respect to other moderators, i.e., all 
data sets used hatchery sourced fish, telemetry sampling 
methods, and juvenile fish.
Chinook Salmon: Within the field-based subset, no 
detectable association was found between turbine type 
and average risk ratios (QM= 0.54, p = 0.461, k = 38). 
Within Kaplan turbines, no detectable association was 
found between sampling method (recapture vs. telem-
etry) and average risk ratios (QM= 0.17, p = 0.684, k = 25). 
Here as well, there was little variation among data sets 
with respect to other moderators i.e., all field-based data 
sets used juvenile fish and mostly hatchery sourced fish.
Rainbow Trout: There was no detectable association 
between site type and average risk ratios (QM= 0.64, 
p = 0.425, k = 45). Otherwise, there was little variation 
among data sets with respect to other moderators i.e., all 
data sets used hatchery sourced fish (or not reported),

Review limitations
Addressing fish productivity
Although our research question pertains to fish produc-
tivity, owing to how the studies were conducted and the 
data typically reported in the commercially published 
and grey literature, it was not feasible to evaluate the 
consequences of entrainment/impingement on fish pro-
ductivity per se as a measure of the elaboration of fish 
flesh per unit area per unit time. Rather, we evaluated 
the risk of freshwater fish injury and mortality owing 
to downstream passage through common hydropower 
infrastructure. Productivity is a broad term often repre-
sented more practically by various components of pro-
ductivity (e.g., growth, survival, individual performance, 
migration, reproduction), which if negatively affected by 
human activities, would have a negative effect on pro-
ductivity [55]. In terms of the consequences of entrain-
ment to fish productivity in the upstream reservoir, all 
entrained fish are no longer contributing regardless of the 
outcome of their passage success (i.e., survival or mor-
tality) if no upstream passage is possible. In the case of 
mortality, fish are permanently removed from the whole 
river system and thus cannot contribute to reproduc-
tion/recruitment. To estimate the impact of entrainment 
consequences to fish productivity, knowledge is required 
of the fish mortality in the context of population vital 
rates. Both of these metrics are extremely difficult and 
costly to measure in the field and are thus rarely quanti-
fied. However, since injury and mortality would directly 
impact components of fish productivity, we contend that 
evaluating injury and mortality contribute to addressing 
the impacts of entrainment and/or impingement on fish 
productivity.
Poor data reporting
In total, 166 data sets from 96 studies were excluded from 
quantitative synthesis, largely (53% of these data sets) for 
two main reasons: (1) quantitative outcome data (e.g., 
number of fish injured or killed) were not reported for the 
intervention and/or comparator group(s); or (2) the total 
number of fish released was either not reported at all for 
the intervention and/or comparator group(s), or only 
an approximate number of fish released were reported. 
Both cases did not allow for an effect size to be calcu-
lated, excluding studies from the meta-analysis. We did 
not attempt to contact authors for the missing data due 
to time constraints. Data availability through online data 
depositories and open source databases have improved 
dramatically over the years. Reporting fish outcomes as 
well as the total fish released for both treatment and con-
trol groups in publications (or through Additional files) 
would benefit future (systematic) reviews.
Potential biases
We attempted to limit any potential biases throughout 
the systematic review process. The collaborative system-
atic review team encompassed a diversity of stakeholders, 
Fig. 17  Weighted pooled risk ratios by a fish species for immediate mortality of Oncorhynchus fish from turbines, and b turbine type for immediate 
mortality of Coho Salmon (O. kisutch) from field-based studies. See Fig. 13 for explanations
Page 31 of 36
Algera et al. Environ Evid             (2020) 9:3 
minimizing familiarity bias. There was no apparent evi-
dence of publication bias for fish injury studies (Addi-
tional file 7: Figure S2), but there was possible evidence 
of publication bias towards studies showing increased 
chances of fish mortality relative to controls (Additional 
file 7: Figure S8, S9). Interestingly, when separating com-
mercially published studies from grey literature studies 
(i.e., reports and conference proceedings), evidence of 
publication bias was only present in the latter, of which 
represented 87% of the immediate mortality data sets. A 
possible explanation for this observation could be that 
these technical reports are often commissioned by hydro-
power operators to quantify known injury and mortality 
issues at their facilities. The commercially published liter-
ature in this evidence base was typically more question-
driven and exploratory in design, whereas the technical 
reports were largely driven by specific objectives (i.e., 
typically placing empirical value on fish mortality known 
to occur at a given facility). This also highlights another 
important finding from our review that nearly 70% (i.e., 
60/87 articles) of the evidence base was grey literature 
sources. Again, while we made every effort to systemati-
cally search for sources of evidence, we received limited 
response from our calls for evidence targeting sources 
of grey literature through relevant mailing lists, social 
media, and communication with the broader stakeholder 
community. As such, we believe there is still relevant grey 
literature that could have been included if it would have 
been more broadly available from those conducting the 
research (i.e., consultant groups or industry rendering 
reports easily accessible, or at least not proprietary).
Geographical and taxonomic biases were evident in the 
quantitative synthesis—the majority of included studies 
were from the United States (91%) and a large percent-
age (81%) evaluated salmonid responses to hydroelec-
tric infrastructure, potentially limiting interpretation of 
review results to other geographic regions and taxa. 
These biases were previously noted by other hydropower-
related reviews (e.g., [56]). To limit availability bias, 
extensive efforts were made obtain all relevant materials 
through our resource network; however, there were sev-
eral reports/publications (n = 32) that were unobtainable. 
A number of unpublished reports, older (e.g., pre-1950’s) 
preliminary/progress reports, and other unofficial docu-
ments were cited in the literature but were unavailable 
because they were not published. This review was limited 
to English language, presenting a language bias. Other 
countries such as France, Germany, and China have 
hydropower developments and research the impacts on 
temperate fish species, but the relevant hydropower lit-
erature base (32 reports/articles) was excluded at full text 
screening due to language.
Reasons for heterogeneity
Several moderators were tested in our quantitative syn-
thesis; however, considerable residual heterogeneity 
remained in the observed effects of hydropower infra-
structure on fish injury and immediate mortality. In some 
cases, meta-data was extracted from studies within the 
evidence base but was not included in quantitative analy-
ses owing to small sample sizes. Four main factors were 
noted as contributing to heterogeneity in fish injury and 
mortality.
First, a top priority of hydropower operators is to iden-
tify trade-offs in facility operations and fish passage, 
attempting to balance fish passage requirements while 
maximizing power generation. Variation in geomorphol-
ogy and hydrology among hydropower sites results in 
site-specific conditions, thus site-specific studies across 
a variety of operating conditions are required to deter-
mine the most favourable conditions for fish passage 
while maintaining power generation output. The facility 
or intervention characteristics (e.g., dam height, water 
levels, turbine model, etc.,) are a major factor in the 
resulting operating conditions of a hydropower facility at 
a given time. Some site characteristics would have direct 
implications for fish injury and mortality. For example, 
spillways with a freefall drop exceeding 50 m are known 
to result in higher injury and/or mortality compared to 
spillways with a shorter drop [53]. The present quanti-
tative synthesis encompassed 42 field sites, resulting in 
considerable variability in site characteristics and operat-
ing conditions of the facilities or interventions (e.g., tur-
bine wicket gate opening, spillway gate opening), which 
would have a measurable impact on injury and mortality. 
Owing to this variability, we were unable to achieve suffi-
cient sample sizes to effectively include site-specific char-
acteristics or operating conditions as effect modifiers.
Second, environmental factors that affect migration/
emigration and physiological processes that could have 
a measurable impact on fish injury and mortality. Water 
temperature affects locomotor activity and fatigue time 
[57–59], and thus may affect a fish’s ability to avoid or 
navigate through infrastructure. Since fish are unable to 
regulate their body temperature, water temperature also 
affects many important physiological processes that are 
implicated in post-passage injury and/or mortality such 
as body condition and wound healing [60, 61]. For exam-
ple, within the salmonid family there is variability in the 
emigration time of juveniles, even within the same spe-
cies [62], such that there are numerous emigration events 
throughout the year. Juveniles emigrating during the 
summer may be more susceptible to injury and mortal-
ity owing to higher water temperatures at the time of 
emigration relative to emigrants in other seasons. Owing 
to the variability in environmental conditions during 
Page 32 of 36
Algera et al. Environ Evid             (2020) 9:3 
passage, it is unlikely that we would have been able to 
achieve sufficient sample sizes to effectively include envi-
ronmental factors as effect modifiers.
Third, behaviour is recognized as paramount to fish 
passage [56, 63], which would have a measurable effect 
on injury and/or mortality. Throughout the screening 
process many studies that had a fish behaviour com-
ponent were excluded from the evidence base because 
there was no relevant injury and/or mortality outcome. 
The majority of these excluded studies examined vari-
ous mechanisms to attract fish towards or deter fish from 
entering certain infrastructure (e.g., lights to attract to 
bypasses, strobe lights to deter from entering turbine 
intakes) (see [25, 64]) or focused on fish passage effi-
ciency and route choice under various environmental 
conditions (e.g., flow regimes). Behaviour is difficult to 
incorporate into conservation science because there is 
high variation in behavioural data and behaviour studies 
have an individual-level focus, which often proves diffi-
cult to scale up to the population level [65, 66]. For exam-
ple, fish have species-specific swimming behaviours that 
influence positional approaches to infrastructure (e.g., 
rheotaxis in juvenile salmonids; [67]), which may lead to 
increased entrainment risk. Behavioural commonalities 
do exist within and among species, so some behaviour-
related heterogeneity was likely accounted for when spe-
cies was included in our analyses. However, owing to the 
small sample size of behavioural studies within the evi-
dence base with injury and/or mortality outcomes, we 
were unable to explicitly include any specific behavioural 
factors as a moderator in our analyses.
Finally, fish passage issues are complex, so the studies 
in the evidence base employed a wide variety of assess-
ment methodologies depending on research objectives, 
site characteristics, and target species. Combining data 
from studies that use different methodologies to assess 
fish injury and mortality can be problematic for meta-
analyses because the data provided is not necessarily 
comparable among studies. Our evidence base encom-
passes several decades of fish passage research (1950 
to 2016; Fig. 3) and vast improvements in fish tracking 
technology, experimental design, and statistical analy-
ses have occurred over that timeframe. Early fish pas-
sage research employed rudimentary methodologies and 
lacked standardization compared to modern research, 
which could lead to measurable differences among older 
and more recent studies in the evidence base. Some 
tracking/marking techniques are more invasive than 
others, which could ultimately influence fish behaviour 
during downstream passage events. For example, surgi-
cally implanting an acoustic telemetry transmitter typi-
cally involves sedation and the implanted transmitter can 
produce an immune response, both of which may impair 
fish behaviour [68]. Conversely, PIT tags typically do not 
require sedation and are minimally invasive to implant 
in the fish. Furthermore, assessing mortality among the 
different fish identification techniques (physical marking, 
PIT tags, telemetry) requires varying levels of extrapola-
tion. Injury and mortality can be directly observed and 
enumerated in studies that pass fish through a turbine 
and recapture occurs at the downstream turbine out-
let. Releasing fish implanted with a transmitter relies 
on subsequent detection of the animal to determine the 
outcome, and the fate of the fish is inferred from these 
detections, not directly observed. Several factors can 
affect fish detection such as noisy environments (e.g., tur-
bine generation, spilling water), technical issues related 
with different tracking infrastructure (e.g., multipath, 
signal collisions), and water conditions (e.g., turbidity 
[69]). A sensitivity analysis revealed that studies inferring 
fish mortality from detections histories (or survival esti-
mates) produced lower risk ratio estimates than studies 
that directly measured mortality (e.g., release upstream—
recapture downstream with net), suggesting disparities in 
mortality estimates between these two methods.
Review conclusions
Entrainment and impingement can occur during down-
stream passage at hydropower operations, causing fish 
injury and mortality, and these hydropower-related fish 
losses have the potential to contribute to decreased fish 
productivity [70, 71]. Even if fish survive an entrainment 
event, they are moved from one reach to another, influ-
encing reach-specific productivity. Hydropower facilities 
differ dramatically in their infrastructure configuration 
and operations and each type of infrastructure presents 
different risks regarding fish injury and/or mortality [72]. 
Quantifying injury and mortality across hydropower pro-
jects and intervention types is fundamental for character-
izing and either mitigating or off-setting the impact of 
hydropower operations on fish productivity.
Here, we present what we believe to be the first compre-
hensive review that systematically evaluated the quality 
and quantity of the existing evidence base on the topic of 
the consequences of entrainment and impingement asso-
ciated with hydroelectric dams for fish. We were unable to 
specifically address productivity per se in the present sys-
tematic review, rather our focus was on injury and mor-
tality from entrainment/impingement during downstream 
passage (see “Review limitations” section above). With an 
exhaustive search effort, we assembled an extensive data-
base encompassing various intervention types (i.e., infra-
structure types), locations (lab, field studies), species, life 
stages (e.g., juveniles, adults), and sources (e.g., hatchery, 
wild). We identified 264 relevant studies (from 87 arti-
cles), 222 of which were eligible for quantitative analysis.

Implications for policy/management
The synthesis of available evidence suggests that hydro-
power infrastructure entrainment increased the overall 
risk of freshwater fish injury and immediate mortality in 
temperate regions, and that injury and immediate mor-
tality risk varied among intervention types. The overall 
impact of hydroelectric infrastructure on delayed mor-
tality was not evaluated due to model instability, likely 
because sampling variances of individual effect sizes were 
extremely large. Owing to variation among study designs 
encompassed within the overall analysis, uncertainty may 
be high, and thus there may be high uncertainty associ-
ated with the injury and immediate mortality risk esti-
mates revealed in our analysis. Regardless of the wide 
range of studies included in our analyses contributing 
to high variability and our use of two different effective 
size metrics, the conclusions are consistent: downstream 
passage via hydropower infrastructure results in a greater 
risk of injury and mortality to fish than controls (i.e., 
non-intervention downstream releases).
Bypasses were found to be the safest fish passage 
intervention, resulting in decreased fish injury and lit-
tle difference in risk of immediate mortality relative to 
controls, a somewhat expected result given that bypasses 
are specifically designed as a safe alternative to spillway 
and turbine passage [13, 73]. In agreement with findings 
highlighted in earlier non-systematic reviews (i.e., [33, 
63, 74, 75]), spillway and turbine passage resulted in the 
highest injury and immediate mortality risk on average, 
and that Francis turbines had a higher mortality risk rela-
tive to controls compared to Kaplan turbines ([56, 76, 77] 
but see Eicher Associates [78]). General infrastructure 
posed an increased risk of injury; however, this category 
encompassed testing on a diversity of hydropower infra-
structure types (turbines, spillways, outlets) and thus is of 
limited use in addressing our secondary research ques-
tion. Lab based turbine studies resulted in a higher risk of 
injury than field-based studies, suggesting that field trials 
may be underestimating fish injury from turbines.
Taxonomic analyses for three economically impor-
tant fish genera revealed that hydropower infrastructure 
increased injury and immediate mortality risk relative 
to controls for Alosa (river herring) and Pacific salmo-
nids (salmon and trout), and delayed mortality risk for 
Anguilla (freshwater eels). Owing to small sample sizes 
within the evidence base, we were unable to include resi-
dent (and other underrepresented) species in our taxo-
nomic analyses. However, we stress that the absence of 
these species within our evidence base and analysis does 
not suggest that injury and mortality risk is lower for 
these species, just that there is insufficient information to 
quantify such impacts. Furthermore, a lack of a statisti-
cally significant overall effect of injury or mortality from 
hydropower infrastructure for the two other genera that 
had ‘sufficient’ samples sizes for inclusion in our analy-
ses (i.e., Lepomis and Salmo), does not imply they are not 
affected by hydropower infrastructure, only that we were 
not able to detect an effect (i.e., there could be an effect 
but we did not detect it, possibly due to low power).
Our analyses also demonstrate that the relative mag-
nitude of hydropower infrastructure impacts on fish 
appears to be influenced by study validity and the type 
of mortality metric used in studies. Higher risk ratios 
were estimated for analyses based on studies with lower 
susceptibility to bias and those that measured actual 
fish mortality, rather than inferred mortality from sur-
vival estimates or detection histories. Overall, placing 
an empirical value (whether relative or absolute) on the 
overall injury and mortality risk to fish is valuable to 
hydropower regulators with the caveat that our analyses 
encompass a broad range of hydrological variables (e.g., 
flow), operating conditions, and biological variables.
Implications for research
The evidence base of this review encompasses a small 
fraction of temperate freshwater fish, particularly biased 
towards economically valuable species such as salmonids 
in the Pacific Northwest of North America. As previ-
ously noted by others [56, 79], research on the impacts 
of hydropower infrastructure on resident fish and/or 
fish with no perceived economic value is underrepre-
sented in the commercially published and grey litera-
ture. Several imperiled fishes also occupy systems with 
hydropower development although they have rarely been 
studied in the context of entrainment [80]. Therefore, 
studies that focus on systems outside of North America, 
on non-salmonid or non-sportfish target species, and 
on population-level consequences of fish entrainment/
impingement are needed to address knowledge gaps.
Aside from immediate (direct) mortality outcomes, 
which are more easily defined and measured using 
recapture-release methods [81], no clear guidelines or 
standardized metrics for assessing injuries and delayed 
mortality outcomes (e.g., temporal and/or spatial 
measurement) were overtly evident in our literature 
searches and screening. Consistency in monitoring 
and measuring fish injury and immediate mortality 
has been reached to some degree, but monitoring fish 
post-passage for delayed injury and mortality is lacking 
in general [74, 79]. The “gold standard” of examining 
the impacts of hydropower on fish should presumably 
include delayed mortality, which we were unable to 
assess in the present review. Drawing from issues we 
encountered during quantitative synthesis and com-
monalities among studies in our evidence base, some 
clear recommendations for standards pertaining to 
Page 34 of 36
Algera et al. Environ Evid             (2020) 9:3 
delayed mortality outcomes and general data analy-
sis include: (1) assessing delayed mortality between 
24 to 48  h; (2) using a paired control group (down-
stream release) for each treatment group (e.g., instead 
of a common control comparator among several treat-
ment release groups); (3) using quantitative outcomes 
(instead of qualitative descriptors e.g., of the 50 fish 
released, most survived); (4) to the extent possible, 
use similar sampling methods and sampling distances 
between release and recapture (or survey) among treat-
ment and control groups.
