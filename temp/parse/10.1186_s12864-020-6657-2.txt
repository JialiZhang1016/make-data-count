Abstract
Background: The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is one of the most studied primate model organisms.
However, the marmoset genomes available in the public databases are highly fragmented and filled with sequence
gaps, hindering research advances related to marmoset genomics and transcriptomics.
Results: Here we utilize single-molecule, long-read sequence data to improve and update the existing genome
assembly and report a near-complete genome of the common marmoset. The assembly is of 2.79 Gb size, with a
contig N50 length of 6.37 Mb and a chromosomal scaffold N50 length of 143.91 Mb, representing the most
contiguous and high-quality marmoset genome up to date. Approximately 90% of the assembled genome was
represented in contigs longer than 1 Mb, with approximately 104-fold improvement in contiguity over the
previously published marmoset genome. More than 98% of the gaps from the previously published genomes were
filled successfully, which improved the mapping rates of genomic and transcriptomic data on to the assembled
genome.
Conclusions: Altogether the updated, high-quality common marmoset genome assembly provide improvements
at various levels over the previous versions of the marmoset genome assemblies. This will allow researchers
working on primate genomics to apply the genome more efficiently for their genomic and transcriptomic
sequence data.

Background
The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small,
new-world monkey, which can be handled in laborator-
ies with relative ease [1–3]. Mouse is a widely used
model animal, however the genetic, physiological, and
anatomical differences between mice and primates pre-
vent their application for human studies, thus insisting on
the necessity of non-human primate (NHP) models [1, 2].
Common marmosets have an effective breeding capacity
relatively among primates, and they show some character-
istics which are more related to humans than the other
NHPs [2]. Common marmosets have been utilized as
models for numerous neurological diseases [2], and a mul-
tiscale brain atlas project called Brain/MINDS had been
initiated with a 10-year roadmap [4]. In addition, marmo-
sets were the first transgenic NHPs to be generated with
germline transmission [1], while also their embryonic stem
cell lines and induced pluripotent stem cell lines are being
widely researched [5, 6]. In light of the increasing import-
ance of marmosets as an alternative NHP model animal
for biomedical and neuroscience research, the genome
was first sequenced by the marmoset genome sequencing
and analysis consortium [7]. The 2.26 Gb assembled gen-
ome from a female marmoset, although was sorted out
into chromosomes, contained many shorter contigs and
also 187,214 gap regions. These hard to assemble gap re-
gions cannot be ignored, as they can lead to false positive
results [8], and the gap regions could harbor many func-
tionally relevant genes [9]. Recent studies have uncovered
that many genes were wrongly labelled as missing in bird
genomes, because of the locality of those genes being GC-
rich and hence had posed challenges in identifying them
[9]. To improve such poorly assembled regions of the
marmoset genome, second-generation sequencing tech-
nology (Illumina) based short reads were employed, which
helped fill approximately one-third (65,384) of the gap re-
gions [10]. However, the genome still remains largely frag-
mented (contig N50 = 61 kbp) aside from the numerous
undetermined bps. Sequence gaps and fragmented contigs
are characteristic features in genome assemblies, however,
with the rise of third-generation sequencing technologies
such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore
sequencing technologies, a large number of genomes are
being updated to high contiguity genomes with the help
of longer reads [11, 12]. As an example, the genomes of
apes assembled using first and second-generation sequen-
cing data were abounded with tens to hundreds of thou-
sands
of
gaps
impacting
multi-genome
sequence
alignments which limited sequence based discoveries [13].
Recently, the ape genomes of Gorilla, Orangutan, and,
Chimpanzee, were sequenced and reassembled using
PacBio reads resulting in large scale improvements in
the respective genomes [13]. Similarly, for the com-
mon
marmoset,
after
first-
and
second-generation
sequencing technologies left the genome fragmented
with many gaps, we have employed PacBio sequen-
cing, a third-generation, single-molecule sequencing
technology, and here, we report the updated version
of the common marmoset genome with fewer gaps
and high contiguity.
Results and discussions
De novo assembly and pseudo-chromosome construction
The long-read sequence data obtained from the PacBio
RSII sequencer amounted to 114.80 Gb, covering ap-
proximately 43 × of the genome (Fig. S1). In the context
of the size of the genome, the lengths of the PacBio
reads (N50: 16.41 kbp; average sequence length: 11 kbp)
were only slightly shorter than the contiguous gap-free
regions from the previous marmoset genome assembly
(N50: 61 kbp; average sequence length: 24 kbp). After
assembling the sequence data with several assembly
tools as part of the assembly workflow (Fig. 1), SMART-
denovo and wtdbg assemblies produced better results
compared to the other assemblers in terms of contiguity,
with N50 values reaching more than 6 Mb (Table S1).
SMARTdenovo produced a slightly shorter N50 in com-
parison to wtdbg, but was chosen as the final assembly
considering that SMARTdenovo had relatively longer
average contig lengths and the least number of contigs.
After constructing pseudo-chromosomes for all the as-
semblies (Table S2), the alternate assemblies were used
to
fill
the
gaps
in
the
SMARTdenovo
pseudo-
chromosomes, resulting in 1771 sequence gaps. The
final assembly size was 2.79 Gb, with a scaffold N50
value of 143.89 Mb corresponding to the chromosome
lengths, and a contig N50 value of 6.38 Mb (Table 1).
The obtained contig N50 value compared favorably
against the recently updated genome assemblies using
PacBio reads, whose average contig N50 was 6.34 Mb
(Table 2). The N50 values were better for the other gen-
ome assemblies, only when multiple additional technolo-
gies such as Hi-C, CHICAGO, and BioNano optical
maps were employed. When considering assemblies
which used only third-generation sequence data for up-
dating the genome, the marmoset genome assembly’s
contig N50 ranked the best among them, in spite of the
relatively longer genome size (Table 2). The assembly
was estimated to comprise 39.37% repeat content. As ex-
pected in the primate genomes, the LINE1 elements
contributed to most (21.44%) of the repeats. SINES
(9.18%) and LTR elements (5.24%) were also distributed
throughout the genome (Table S3). Only a very small
percentage (0.07%) of the repeats was left unclassified. A
total of 18,385 gene models, along with 78,992 alterna-
tively spliced transcripts, were obtained using the com-
bined approach.

Evaluation of the assembly
As of March 31, 2019, the NCBI database for assembly
of the common marmoset genome contained four as-
semblies: i) the first genome submitted at 2010 [7], ii)
the improved genome using Illumina submitted at 2015
[10], iii) an Ion-torrent based genome submitted at
2015, and iv) an Illumina based genome anchored by Hi-
C and CHICAGO libraries submitted at 2017 (Table S4).
The ion-torrent based assembly contained more than
one Gb of the genome missing and hence was ignored
for the evaluation purpose, while the rest of the assem-
blies were designated names in this manuscript, accord-
ing to their submission years as CJ2010, CJ2015, and
CJ2017, respectively. The genome assembly presented in
this study was designated as CJ2019. When BUSCO [27]
was executed for the assemblies, the BUSCO scores
yielded 92.9% completeness for both CJ2017 and CJ2019
assemblies, and 92.1 and 91.9% completeness for CJ2010
and CJ2015 assemblies respectively. This indicated that
all the assemblies had high level of completeness at the
level of conserved genes. The major differences between
the current assembly and the previous assemblies were
observed in contiguity, number of sequence gaps, and
mapping rates of sequence data.
Improved contiguity
Using the contig N50 value as a metric, CJ2019 pro-
duced 217.76, 104.42, and 41.06 fold contiguity improve-
ments over CJ2010, CJ2015, and CJ2017 assemblies,
respectively (Fig. S2). The CJ2019 assembly also showed
a range of 36.88 to 177.22 fold improvements in contig
N75 values over the previous marmoset assemblies (Fig.
S2). To further insist on the quality of the CJ2019 as-
sembly at the contiguity level, 2.50 Gb of the 2.79 Gb
genome was represented in contigs which were longer
than 1 Mb. Also, 54 contigs were of length more than
10 Mb, while it should be noted that there was not even
a single contig which managed to reach a length of 1 Mb
in any of the previous marmoset assemblies. When the
N(x) values are plotted, although the scaffold N(x) values
were similar across the assemblies (Fig. 2a), the other as-
semblies fell below in comparison to the CJ2019 contig
graph (Fig. 2b). All the assemblies produced scaffolds in
the range of chromosomal lengths, with the N50 values
reaching 132.17 Mb, 140.45 Mb, 129.2 Mb, and 143.89
Mb for CJ2010, CJ2015, CJ2017, and CJ2019 assemblies
respectively.
Reduced sequence gaps
The other major improvement in the CJ2019 assembly is
a significant reduction in the number of sequence gaps
(Table 3). While the CJ2015 genome closed approxi-
mately 41% of the gaps in the CJ2010 genome, the
current CJ2019 genome resulted in 1771 gaps, closing

more than 98% of the sequence gaps from the previous
versions of the marmoset genome. This resulted in more
than 99% of the genome being sequenced, leaving only
complex regions such as centromeric repeats, and large
segmental duplications to be filled. The closing of the
gaps greatly facilitated the mapping of all kinds of data
onto the CJ2019 assembly, increasing the space for re-
peat and gene identifications.
Improved mapping rates
When marmoset RNAseq reads from 12 different brain
tissues were aligned against the assemblies, the average
mapping rate was below 80% for all the previous assem-
blies. In contrast, the CJ2019 genome assembly displayed
more than 80% alignment in all but one of the samples
(Fig. 3a). On average, the mapping rates were 8.26, 9.93,
and 5.13% higher than the CJ2010, CJ2015, and CJ2017
assemblies respectively. Also, Human Gencode (Release
29) transcripts, mapped more to the CJ2019 genome
than the previous versions. When BAC-end data were
mapped, against the current chromosomal genomes
(CJ2010 and CJ2015) at NCBI, the difference in mapping
rates was more than 12% (Fig. 3b). Compared to the
CJ2017 assembly, the concordant mapping rate of BAC-
end data was increased by 6.30%. The increase in map-
ping rates is further proof that the genome has been im-
proved significantly.
Possible structural errors
CJ2017 and CJ2019 genome assemblies were aligned
against each other with minimap2 [28] and visualized
using dot plots generated by d-genies [29]. Numerous
small and large inversions were observed between the
two assemblies. Hi-C scaffolding can erroneously intro-
duce inversions in short contigs [30], and this can be at-
tributed to the small inversions observed in the dot plots
(Fig. 4a). However, larger inversions, such as that ob-
served in chromosome 16 (Fig. 4b), could be actual mis-
assembled structural errors. The mapping of long-range
paired BAC-end reads did not support the chromosome
16 inversion of CJ2019 genome, indirectly hinting that
the make-up at this particular location is more accurate
in CJ2017 genome. It has to be noted that the original
marmoset genome assembly was constructed with hu-
man genome as a guiding factor, and hence some parts
are effectively humanized and could be actually struc-
tural errors. A new common marmoset genome, as a
part of the Vertebrate Genome Project, is under devel-
opment, which includes 55.69 x coverage of 10x genom-
ics data, 105.81 x coverage of Arima Hi-C data, 154.52 x
coverage of BioNano optical map data, along with Pac-
Bio and Illumina sequence reads [31]. Although vast im-
provements in terms of contiguity, sequence gaps, and
mapping rates of various genomic elements could be ob-
served in the CJ2019 assembly, structural errors could
potentially remain which would need the combination of
the above data to effectively resolve them.
Conclusions
The high-quality genome constructed as part of this
manuscript has shown vast improvements in terms of
contiguity, gaps, genomic features, and mapping rates of
sequence data and will be widely useful for researchers
involved in the field of primate genomics.
Methods
Sample preparation and sequencing
The liver sample (Animal I2075) from the Central Insti-
tute for Experimental Animals (CIEA), Japan, was ori-
ginally used to improve the Marmoset genome using
Illumina [10], with ample part of the animal’s samples
retained for future use. Briefly, an 8-year, 4-month-old
male marmoset liver was used for DNA extraction using
the
phenol-chloroform-isoamyl
alcohol
extraction

method. The genomic DNA for long-read sequencing in
this study was extracted from the kidney of the same
animal described above. The genomic DNA was ex-
tracted using QIAGEN Genomic-tip 500/G (Qiagen, Hil-
den,
Germany)
according
to
the
manufacturer’s
instruction. To avoid blood contamination, bloodletting
was performed completely at the dissection. The gen-
omic sample was sequenced using PacBio RSII sequen-
cer on 93 SMRT cells. In addition, RNA sequencing was
also employed to improve the prediction of gene models.
Two male marmosets (Animals: I5998 and I6289) that
were 2 years old and obtained from CLEA Japan Inc.
were deeply anaesthetized with isoflurane and eutha-
nized by exsanguination from the femoral artery. Twelve
tissue samples from the brain (Table S5) were collected
and immediately frozen using liquid nitrogen and were
rapidly broken down in solution D using a polytron
homogenizer, before extracting the total RNA by the
acid
guanidinium
thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform
method. The quality and the concentration of the sam-
ple were measured using the 2100 Bioanalyzer instru-
ment with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano kit. The cDNA
sequencing libraries were constructed with 1000 nano-
grams of total RNA using the TruSeq RNA Sample Prep
Kit (Illumina), following the instructions in the TruSeq
RNA Sample Preparation V2 Guide (Illumina). MiSeq
Reagent Kit v3 (600-cycles) was used for sequencing the
RNA samples (2 * 150 bp PE reads) with the MiSeq
sequencer.
De novo assembly and pseudo-chromosome construction
The sequenced reads were input to several assembly
tools as recommended in the benchmark article [32], in-
cluding Canu [33], SMARTdenovo [34], wtdbg [35],
miniasm [36], Flye [37], Falcon [38], and MECAT [39],
as part of the assembly workflow (Fig. 1). MECAT
aborted with a segmentation fault, while Falcon pro-
duced relatively shorter contigs, and both were subse-
quently left out from the further analysis. Quiver [40]
was executed in two iterative rounds to polish all the as-
semblies. In the case of wtdbg and miniasm assemblies,
an additional round of quiver was performed owing to
their relatively high error rates in the consensus se-
quences. RaGOO [41] was used to construct pseudo-
chromosomes from the assembled contigs by using the
previous marmoset genome [10], as a reference. To fill
the gaps, a hybrid assembly was constructed by mapping,
using minimap2, the flanking regions of sequence gaps
in the SMARTdenovo assembly against the contiguous
regions of the other assemblies, and replacing the gaps
with nucleotide bps. Two rounds of consensus polishing
by Pilon [42], using Illumina data from the same sample
[10], was also executed to polish the assemblies further.
Genome annotation
Repeat content was assessed using RepeatModeler and
RepeatMasker [43]. The repeats, in the contiguous se-
quences of the assembly, were first identified by Repeat-
Modeler to construct repeat family libraries, which were
in turn used by RepeatMasker to annotate and mask the
repetitive
regions
of
the
assembled
pseudo-
chromosomes. For gene annotation, a random set of
1000 multi-exon genes were obtained from Ensembl
(Release version 95) database’s common marmoset gene
annotation to train gene models using Augustus [44]. In
addition, a combination of ab-initio based, homology
based, and transcriptome-based strategies were applied
to predict and update the predicted genes. In the hom-
ology based approach, protein sequences were collected
from a) the recently assembled Chimpanzee and Orang-
utan genomes [13], from NCBI, b) NCBI’s NR protein
database for the Gorilla genome, and c) the Gencode
(Release 29) database for the Human genome, and were
aligned against the assembled genome using funannotate
[45], which in-turn uses diamond [46], and exonerate
[47]. Parallelly, Marmoset ESTs downloaded from NCBI
were input to PASA [48], to model gene structures from
the EST alignments. These EST and protein alignments
were provided as hints for the Augustus ab-initio gene
prediction program with the trained gene model as the
species parameter on the assembled genome, which was
earlier soft-masked for repeats using RepeatMasker.
Later, RNAseq reads from the 12 different brain tissues
(Table S5), as well as marmoset samples from the study,
SRP051959 [49], were de novo assembled into tran-
scripts using Trinity [50]. PASA was used once again, in
conjunction with the Trinity transcripts, to update the
UTR and alternate splicing information of the predicted
genes.
Evaluation of the assembly
BUSCO was used to evaluate the completeness of the
evolutionarily conserved genes in the assemblies. To fur-
ther evaluate the quality of the de novo assembly, differ-
ent sets of DNA and RNA data were aligned against the
assembled genomes. RNAseq reads, Human Gencode
transcripts, and BAC-end data, were aligned against the
genome assemblies using STAR [51], GMAP [52], and
bowtie2 [53] aligners respectively. Minimap2 [28] was
used to align the whole genome assemblies against each
other, and d-geneis [29] was used to obtain and visualize
dot plots from the alignments.
