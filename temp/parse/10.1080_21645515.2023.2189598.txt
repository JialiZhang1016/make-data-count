Supplementary Figure 1. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of differentially expressed genes between 
pre-immunization and 5 days after the second immunization in the three-dose immunization group. 
Differential genes with a fold change > = 2.0 were chosen for GO analysis, including Biological 
Process, Cellular Component, and Molecular Function analysis.

Supplementary Figure 2. KEGG analysis of differentially expressed genes between pre-
immunization and 5 days after the second immunization in the three-dose immunization group. 
Differential genes with a fold change > = 2.0 were chosen for KEGG analysis.
