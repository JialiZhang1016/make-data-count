Abstract. Between 2018 and 2022, four pearl farming Tuamotu atolls of French Polynesia were monitored with
autonomous oceanographic instruments to measure the hydrodynamics of atoll lagoons and the ocean–lagoon
water exchanges. These surveys were conducted within the framework of the ANR-funded MANA (Management
of Atolls) project and its extensions to additional sites. The overarching goal was to improve knowledge on the
processes inﬂuencing the spat collection of the pearl oyster Pinctada margaritifera, the oyster species used to
produce black pearls. These data sets are also critical for the calibration and validation of 3D high spatial resolu-
tion hydrodynamic models used to study oyster larval dispersal within lagoons. The observational strategies fo-
cused on the characterization of ocean–lagoon exchanges through passes and hoa (i.e., shallow reef ﬂats), lagoon
circulation, incident waves breaking on the forereef, water elevation inside the lagoon as well as spatial temper-
ature variability. Chronologically, the investigated atolls were ﬁrst Raroia Atoll with 9 months of measurements
between May 2018 and March 2019 during which the MALIS1 and MALIS2 cruises on-board the R/V ALIS
took place. It was followed by a 4 month deployment in Takapoto Atoll (November 2021 to March 2022). In
late April 2022, Apataki Atoll was instrumented until end of July, followed by Takaroa measurements between
July and October 2022. Apataki (Leg2) and Takaroa Atoll were conjointly instrumented during the MALIS 3
oceanographic cruise. Altogether, those multi-atoll data bring a worldwide unique oceanographic atoll data set
that is useful for addressing local pearl farming questions but potentially beneﬁcial for other fundamental and
applied investigations. Each data set was post-processed, quality controlled and converted into NetCDF format.

Introduction
This study focuses on hydrodynamic data collected between
2018 and 2022 on four pearl farming atolls of the Tuamotu
Archipelago, in French Polynesia. French Polynesia (FP)
is a French overseas collectivity located in the Central Pa-
ciﬁc Ocean (134 to 155◦W and 7 to 27◦S). It consists
of ﬁve archipelagos (Fig. 1b) and 118 atolls and high is-
lands spread on a vast Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) with
4.8 million km2 (Andréfouët and Adjeroud, 2019). The Tu-
amotu and Gambier Archipelagoes include a total of 77 atolls
and several high islands that are found in the lagoon of Gam-
bier. Five of the atolls are actually with dry or uplifted la-
goons. The other 72 atolls all have an intertidal or partly
emerged rim surrounding the lagoon. Among the atolls with
a deep (> 20 m) lagoon, about 30 have been black pearl farm-
ing atolls since the beginning of this activity in the late 1980s.
Currently, as of 2023, only 20 are active or operational.
Black pearl farming is the second source of income for
French Polynesia after tourism. In 2021, it represented a
EUR 40 million value in exports (Andréfouët et al., 2022b).
This activity emerged as a major activity after nearly 60 years
of trials and pioneering work. Since the 1980s and especially
the 1990s, the number of exploitations has boomed, owing
to the presence of abundant natural stocks of oysters Pinc-
tada margaritifera. This stock has allowed to the spats to be
efﬁciently collected in several lagoons, and a sustained sup-
ply of oysters for pearl production. The activity thus includes
oyster production (through spat collection) and pearl pro-
duction. In 2021, 8136 ha of lagoon concessions were dedi-
cated to these activities (DRM, 2021). Four islands and atolls
(Gambier, Marutea Sud, Ahe and Arutua) represent half of
the concessions but many other atolls contribute to the activ-
ity (such as Apataki, Takapoto, Takaroa, Katiu, Kauehi and
Raroia). However, there are ups and downs. For instance,
Takaroa atoll lagoon suffered a major dystrophy event in
2014 (Rodier et al., 2019), resulting in mass mortality of oys-
ters and spats. Since then, the activity has been moribund in
this lagoon, and has not yet recovered as of 2023. Overall
in French Polynesia, the numbers of farmers have decreased
over the past few years and have now stabilized at around
600 farmers, with 340 of them producing pearls.
Since the ﬁrst mortality events in Takapoto atoll in the
1980s, pearl farming lagoons have been the objects of nu-
merous scientiﬁc investigations related to the biology and
ecophysiology of P. margaritifera, the estimation of natural
stocks, or the characterization of the planktonic trophic web
and food sources for oysters, among many other topics (Le
Pennec, 2010; Andréfouët et al., 2012b, 2022b; Gueguen et
al., 2016). Lagoon hydrodynamics became a focus during the
Programme General Recherche sur la Nacre 2 (PGRN2) in
the late 1990s, using a comparative approach between atoll
lagoons but with limited ﬁeld measurements (Pagès and An-
dréfouët, 2001; Andréfouët al., 2001b), in the wake of the
comparative TYPATOLL program (Dufour and Harmelin-
Vivien, 1997).
Following the ﬁrst Tuamotu–Gambier Atoll hydrody-
namic modeling work by Tartinville et al. (1997) that in-
vestigated Moruroa Atoll in the context of nuclear weapon
tests consequences, a workshop in 2004 in Tahiti identiﬁed
the main steps required to achieve 3D high spatial resolution
numerical models to address pearl farming questions (André-
fouët et al., 2006). A high priority topic was to better under-
stand spat collection variability, for which it was necessary to
better characterize the P. margaritifera larval dispersal phase
in spat collection lagoons exposed to different oceanographic
and atmospheric forcings.
Ahe Atoll became the ﬁrst atoll investigated for 3D hy-
drodynamical modeling, with for the ﬁrst time a large ar-
ray of in situ measurements (Dumas et al., 2012). Ahe Atoll
had a 1 yr dedicated ﬁeld program in 2008–2009 (see Le
Gendre, 2020a, for sampling strategy), followed by a ded-
icated oceanographic POLYPERL cruise in 2013 (André-
fouët, 2013). Ahe was followed by Takaroa Atoll but only
with a short ﬁeld expedition in 2009 (see Le Gendre, 2020b,
for sampling strategy). Results from Ahe Atoll model proved
to be very useful in characterizing larval dispersal variability
(Thomas et al., 2012, 2014, 2016).
To build on these ﬁrst results, the ANR-funded MANA
(Management of Atolls) project was launched in 2017 (An-
dréfouët et al., 2022b) and was completed in Septem-
ber 2022. The overarching goals of the project were to pro-
vide new spatially explicit products useful for the man-
agement of geomorphologically diverse pearl farming atolls
(namely Ahe, Takaroa and Raroia in French Polynesia and
Manihiki in the Cook Islands). Focus was still on under-
standing spat collection on different sites, but also providing
guidelines for stock management and restocking (André et
al., 2022; Violette et al., 2023). Funds and instruments pro-
vided by the local Direction des Ressources Marines (DRM)
in charge of the management of pearl farming lagoons ex-
panded the MANA project to two new sites (Gambier Islands
and Takapoto Atoll). Finally, the Commission Nationale de
la Flotte Côtiere also supported the project with ship time
(R/V ALIS) for two cruises in Raroia Atoll in 2018 (André-
fouët, 2018) and one cruise targeting in particular the Ap-
ataki and Takaroa Atolls in 2022 (Andréfouët and Le Gendre,
2022).
This paper reports on the in situ data collected within
the framework of the MANA project and its derivatives on
Raroia Takapoto, Takaroa and Apataki atolls between 2018
and 2022 (Fig. 1c). It is organized as follows: Sect. 2 brieﬂy
presents the French Polynesia climate to draw the regional
context, and the general sampling strategy applied to atolls
during the MANA project considering the typical geomor-
phology of atolls and their lagoons and the hydrodynamic
processes at stake. Then, the sampling strategy speciﬁc to the
different study sites is developed in Sect. 3. Oceanographic
instruments used during all surveys are detailed in Sect. 4

The French Polynesia atolls context: climate,
geomorphology and hydrodynamic processes
2.1
French Polynesia climate
Owing to the large latitudinal and longitudinal variations,
there are local weather differences between French Polynesia
archipelagoes, but overall, the French Polynesia climate has
two seasons (Laurent and Maamaatuaiahutapu, 2019). The
wet and warm season ranges from November to April (Aus-
tral summer) with weak trade winds (northeast to southeast)
and moderate waves including distant swells originating in
the Northern Hemisphere. Then, a cooler and dryer season
occurs from May to October (Austral winter), with stronger
trade winds and high-energy distant swells from the South-
ern Hemisphere. The weather is inﬂuenced by the proximity
of the South Paciﬁc Convergence Zone (SPCZ) leading to
higher rainfalls during December to March, albeit with sig-
niﬁcant spatial and interannual variations between archipela-
goes (Laurent and Maamaatuaiahutapu, 2019).
The interannual El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) af-
fects the French Polynesian climate and particularly pre-
cipitations and trade wind regimes. ENSO inﬂuences the
position of the SPCZ, which leads to increased precipita-
tions, higher occurrences of tropical cyclones and changes in
wind regimes during the El Niño phase (Laurent and Varney,
2014). Conversely, the La Niña phase exacerbates the main
features of the neutral years, with lower precipitation and

drought, especially in the north (Marquesas Archipelago),
and lower east to southeast trade winds overall.
The wind and wave regimes of French Polynesia with a fo-
cus on pearl farming sites was recently revisited at different
temporal scales (Dutheil et al., 2020, 2021). The wave regime
is much more spatially variable and atoll-dependent than the
wind regime considering the shadowing effects on the propa-
gation of wave trains created by the position of atolls relative
to each other (Andréfouët et al., 2012a, 2022b).
2.2
Atoll geomorphology and hydrodynamic process:
the clues for the MANA project ﬁeld data collection
strategy
During the MANA project and its extensions, a total of four
atolls (Raroia, Takapoto, Apataki and Takaroa, Fig. 2, Ta-
ble 1) have been instrumented with physical instruments to
better understand the processes inﬂuencing Pinctada mar-
garitifera spat collection variability. Instruments were also
needed for the calibration and validation of 3D high spatial
resolution hydrodynamical models and to improve the real-
ism of existing models. The deployments took place between
2018 and 2022, with an interruption due to the COVID pan-
demic (Fig. 3). We describe in this section the general fea-
tures encountered on all atolls and the principles used for
the sampling strategy to capture the main hydrodynamic pro-
cesses. Section 3 provides the sampling speciﬁcs per atoll.
High-resolution bathymetry data were collected by pri-
vate sub-contractors using mono-beam (Takaroa Atoll) or
multibeam (Takapoto, Raroia atolls) sounders (Andréfouët
et al., 2020). Soundings were resampled and interpolated to
achieve a 10 m resolution bathymetric grid for Raroia and
Takapoto and a 60 m resolution grid for Takaroa Atoll, prior
to the development of hydrodynamic models. Conversely, the
Apataki lagoon has not been entirely mapped yet as of 2023.
Extrinsic factors (such as the wind or wave regimes) and
intrinsic factors (such as the degree of aperture) are both
strong drivers of hydrobiogeochemical functioning in atoll
lagoons (Dufour et al., 2001; Andréfouët al., 2001b). They
both need to be taken into account when sampling atoll la-
goons for their hydrodynamics, as explained hereafter in
generic terms.
Wind and wave inﬂuence the lagoon renewal and its cir-
culation. On an archipelago scale, the swell climate of any
given atoll is highly dependent on its position relative to other
atolls that can block the incoming swells (Andréfouët et al.,
2012a). For instance, the large Tuamotu atolls in the south of
the archipelago (Rangiroa, Fakarava, Kaukura, etc.) block all
incoming southern swells. It is therefore necessary to mea-
sure incoming waves with pressure sensors on, if possible, all
the sectors of exposition of the studied atoll. Regional wave
models are also useful to assess the conditions during a sur-
vey, and Wave Watch III model data have been used at high
spatial resolution in some cases (Andréfouët et al., 2012a;
Dutheil et al., 2021; Andréfouët et al., 2022a, 2023b). Wind
data are generally not monitored during shore-based ﬁeld
campaigns, as we relied on either the nearby Météo-France
weather station if possible (e.g., Takaroa Atoll, Gambier
Islands, data available through https://publitheque.meteo.fr,
last access: 20 May 2023) or ERA5 reanalysis data (Hers-
bach et al., 2020). When on board the R/V ALIS, the ship
weather station also records wind data.
Although all atolls can be different in terms of lagoon
bathymetry (Andréfouët al., 2020), size, and exposure to
wind and waves, all atolls share common geomorphologi-
cal features that play a role in the lagoon hydrodynamics.
Atoll landforms siting on the atoll rims are reef islands (lo-
cally named motu). They result from the accumulation of car-
bonate sediments above antecedent (Holocene) conglomer-
ate platforms (Montaggioni et al., 2021). Rims can be vege-
tated or not (Andréfouët et al., 2001a). Atoll rims can have 0,
1, 2 or 3 (at maximum) deep passages (or pass) and a number
(from a handful to several hundreds) of shallow spillways (lo-
cally named hoa) along the atoll rim that connect the ocean
to the lagoon.
In generic terms, water movements from the ocean to the
lagoon through the pass and shallow hoa are controlled by
tide and waves. Note ﬁrst that the tidal range in this region
of the world is low (10 to 50 cm maximum in the ocean from
west Tuamotu to Gambier Archipelago) owing to the pres-
ence of an amphidromic point west of Tuamotu (Dumas et
al., 2012; Laurent and Maamaatuaiahutapu, 2019). All the
sites treated here are thus in a micro-tidal environment. In-
coming waves breaking on the atoll crest directly modulate
the ﬂows through the wave-exposed open spillways (Tart-
inville et al., 1997; Dumas et al., 2012; Aucan et al., 2021;
Andréfouët al., 2022a). The number and width of hoa are
used to deﬁne the degree of aperture of an atoll, as a coarse
proxy useful to characterize the water exchanges between
ocean and lagoon and some biogeochemical variables (Du-
four et al., 2001).
The degree of aperture of the atoll also inﬂuences the lag
between oceanic and lagoonal tides. Even atolls with wide
deep passes experience a few hours’ shift in tidal lagoon sig-
nal compared with the ocean. They are also subjected to a
lagoon tidal amplitude lower than in the ocean (Dumas et al.,
2012; Aucan et al., 2021). These differences are also a factor
that complicates the establishment of a common water level
baseline between the lagoon and the ocean (Callaghan et al.,
2006). It is a problem speciﬁc to atolls with passes (Aucan
et al., 2021). Without the availability of appropriate differen-
tial sensors (see the Sensor section hereafter), the water level
baseline is therefore established around the average sea level
measured in the lagoon or ocean (Aucan et al., 2021).
In the lagoon, even if current speeds are typically low (Du-
mas et al., 2012), internal circulation cells occur, that are
highly dynamic and predominantly controlled by wind speed
and direction, as shown for instance for Ahe (Dumas et al.,
2012) or Mururoa Atolls (Tartinville et al., 1997). A large la-
goon is potentially much more complex in term of numbers

and dynamics of these hydrodynamic cells than the smaller
atolls. If there is a pass, its inﬂuence can generate locally
strong currents; but it is nevertheless spatially limited owing
to the alternate incoming–outgoing tide-driven currents (Du-
mas et al., 2012).
Temperature in the lagoon inﬂuences oyster development,
survival at the larval and adult stages, and the ﬁnal pearl qual-
ity, plus other indirect factors such as plankton availability
(Thomas et al., 2010; Le Moullac et al., 2016; Latchere et
al., 2018; Sangare et al., 2020). Temperature is monitored
according to an array of temperature-measuring sensors de-
ployed in the ocean, passes, hoa and lagoon. In the lagoon,
a systematic spatial coverage is sought as well as a 3D cov-
erage by deploying sensors vertically at the sub-surface (ap-
proximately 2 m), and at a depth of 10 m and ﬁnally 40 m.
This information is also useful to assess lagoon stratiﬁcation
during low wind periods.

February 2020. It is a group of high islands and data are presented elsewhere (Bruyère et al., 2023d) because the sampling strategy obeys
different criteria than atolls.
The MANA observational strategy objectives integrate all
the aforementioned processes. In situ instruments were thus
deployed to capture:
– Sea level variations, tidal dynamics and surge (ocean,
lagoon), using pressure sensors
– Incoming incident waves on the different atoll sectors
and wave (wind-induced) in the lagoon, using pressure
sensors
– Currents in hoa on different atoll sectors, using current
meters or current proﬁlers moored in hoa facing the
pressure sensors that measure the incident waves
– Currents in passes and inside the lagoon using current
proﬁlers
– Water temperature variations in the ocean and the la-
goon in different rim and lagoon sectors, using a vari-
ety of temperature-recording sensors (temperature-only,
pressure or current-meter sensors)

Study sites and sampling strategy
This paper presents data collected between 2018 and 2022
in four Tuamotu Archipelago atolls, chronologically Raroia,
Takapoto, Apataki and Takaroa Atolls. The following sec-
tions (Sect. 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4) present each atoll and the
implemented observational strategy. The length of data ac-
quisition ranged between 3 and 9 months. Raroia and Ap-
ataki deployments were organized in legs to achieve long de-
ployment duration while allowing regular instrument main-
tenance (e.g., battery replacing, bio-fouling, ofﬂoaded data,
checking of the mooring component). The beginning or end
of a leg is thus generally synonymous with a short data
collection interruption for maintenance. Long deployments
were a combination of shore-based and research vessel-based
work. Atolls were equipped with ﬁve different types of in-
struments, namely Acoustic Doppler Current Proﬁlers (AD-
CPs), current proﬁlers, drag-tilt current meters, temperature
and pressure loggers, and temperature sensors. Instrument
conﬁgurations and speciﬁcities are presented hereafter in a
dedicated section (Sect. 4).
3.1
Raroia Atoll
Raroia is a large atoll (area 368 km2) in the central Tuamotu
region (Andréfouët et al., 2020). The atoll is oriented along
the NE-SW direction (Fig. 2) and exposed to the east trade
winds. The eastern reef rim is open to the ocean with numer-
ous hoa and motu. The western side has one deep and wide
(500 m) pass (Garue pass) as well as a few shallow hoa. The
southern portion has a wide uninterrupted 5 km-long hoa.
The northwest and north sides are closed by a vegetated rim.
The lagoon is deep with an average depth of 32 m. It has a
typical saucer-shaped geomorphology but with the presence
of a very high number of pinnacles (> 1600) rising from the
ﬂoor and distributed homogenously throughout the lagoon
(Table 1).
Raroia was the subject of the most complex and intensive
deployment. The 9 month physical observations started in the
middle of May 2018 and ended in late March 2019. The de-
ployments were organized in three legs (between May and
August 2018, August and December 2018 and between Jan-
uary and March 2019 respectively) as well as one extra “short

leg” conducted during the MALIS2 cruise with a speciﬁc set-
ting and deployment (Fig. 2). Surveys were in part conducted
during the oceanographic campaigns MALIS 1 and MALIS 2
with the R/V ALIS (Andréfouët, 2018; Aucan et al., 2021).
The sampling strategy is summarized in Fig. 4. The instru-
ments moored in the lagoon, hoa, pass and oceanic sides of
the atoll were either moored at the same location during the
entire three legs, or their deployment was leg dependent (see
Table A1 in Appendix A). Three stations were positioned
on the external reef slopes on the north-east (O2), south
(O3), and north-west (O1) atoll side to measure offshore in-
cident waves with pressure sensors. These oceanic sensors
were systematically paired with current meter (proﬁlers or
drag-tilt current meters) moored inside hoa directly facing
the oceanic sensor’s location. Water levels inside the lagoon
were recorded at ﬁve stations (L4, L5, L6, L7, L8) to de-
duce surge and tide signal using pressure sensors. Those la-
goonal pressure loggers were systematically associated with
two temperature sensors moored on the sub-surface and at
a depth of around 20 m. These three-sensor stations were
replicated spatially to characterize the within-lagoon spatial
heterogeneity. Current proﬁlers were anchored inside three
hoa (western, eastern and southern) that faced the oceanic
pressure sensors. Inside the Garue Pass deep current proﬁlers
were moored to evaluate water ﬂuxes lagoonward and ocean-
ward as well as at the edge of the pass lagoonward to study
the pass gyre (Pass2). Finally, two additional loggers were
positioned in the south lagoon to measure lagoon currents in
the spat collection area (L7 and L8). During the short leg,
these two lagoon proﬁlers were moved to the north lagoon,
close to H1 and H2. Table A1 refers to the exact period and
location of mooring for each sensor.
3.2
Takapoto Atoll
Takapoto is a medium-sized 78 km2 northwestern Tuamotu
atoll. This atoll is distinct from the other studied atolls owing
to the absence of deep passes connecting the lagoon to the
open ocean. It is the most closed of all the study sites with
only few several narrow hoa present on both the west and
east ﬂanks of the atoll (Andréfouët et al., 2022a). The max-
imal and average lagoon depth are respectively 43 and 25 m
(Table 1). Pinnacles can be found everywhere in the lagoon
but their density is higher on the south-west region (André-
fouët et al., 2020).
This atoll was monitored over a 4 month period (Novem-
ber 2021 to March 2022). Measurements focused on the en-
try of oceanic water via the few active hoa present in two re-
gions, namely Teavatika (southest region) and Takaï (north-
west region) (Fig. 5). Two stations with paired Aquadopp (in
the deeper part of hoa) and RBRduet T.D (ocean side) were
set in Teavatika (station O01 and Aqua2) and Takaï (station
O03 and Aqua1) areas in order to measure breaking wave
parameters and current velocity related to waves and tides.
Inside the lagoon, two additional stations in the middle and
south lagoon were instrumented with one RBRduet T.D and
two SBE56 (one in sub-surface and one below 30 m) follow-
ing the strategy applied for Raroia (see Sect. 3.1).
3.3
Apataki Atoll
Apataki Atoll is a Western Tuamotu atoll and is the largest in-
strumented atoll (678 km2) of the MANA project, represent-
ing eight times the area of Takapoto Atoll (Table 1). The atoll
rim is almost completely closed on the east and north sides.
The southern region is an 18 km-long, wide open reef ﬂat
highly subjected to oceanic entries caused by distant swells
(south-south-east are the dominant swell directions). Finally,
the western rim is dominated by a succession of wide reef
ﬂats, narrow hoa and motu. Two deep passes both located on
the west side and respectively named (Pakaka in the south
and Tehere in the north) allow the oceanic and lagoonal sys-
tems to connect. As previously said, complete bathymetric
coverage is not yet available for the lagoon and instrumented
stations were selected and positioned using satellite imagery.
Pinnacles visible on satellite images are few (63, see Table 1)
and spread over the entire lagoon.
The resulting data set covers a 4 month period separated
into two legs: Leg 1 (April 2022 to July 2022) and Leg 2
(July 2022). Leg 2 measurements were managed during the
MALIS 3 oceanographic cruise with the R/V ALIS (André-
fouët and Le Gendre, 2022). Lagoonal stations (L1, L2, L3,
L6) with one RBRduet T.D and two SBE56 sensors follow
the same strategy applied to Raroia and Takapoto (Fig. 6).
Pressure sensors moored on the oceanic forereef were posi-
tioned on the south (O1–O2) and east sides (O3) to face hoa.
The facing southern hoa were instrumented with two current
proﬁlers (O1 paired with Aqua2 and O2 with Aqua1) in or-
der to record oceanic ﬂuxes crossing the reef. Deep current
proﬁlers (P01, P02 and P03) were anchored inside or under
the inﬂuence of the passes to evaluate current intensity and
direction (Fig. 6).

Takaroa Atoll
Takaroa Atoll is located 10 km eastward from Takapoto Atoll
(Sect. 3.3) in the Northwestern Tuamotu region (14.27◦S–
145◦W). Its 86 km2 lagoon is characterized by a semi-closed
continuous rim with small hoa on the southern region, and
by a narrow deep pass (Teaunonae Pass) reaching a length of
170 m long and a depth of 20 m (Fig. 7). The lagoon has an
average depth of 26 m and a maximum depth of 47 m (Ta-
ble 1). Pinnacles are abundant in the central deep lagoon
area (Fig. 7). This atoll was previously studied in 2009 (see
Le Gendre, 2020b, for sampling strategy), but the data col-
lected were limited. During the MALIS 3 cruise in July–
August 2022 (Andréfouët and Le Gendre, 2022), the pass
was instrumented to get additional measurement (3 months)
of current velocity and direction using one current proﬁler
sensor moored at a depth of 18 m.

Oceanographic instruments
Each sensor deployed in various atolls was autonomous and
moored on the seabed by SCUBA with a suitable structure
adapted to the station substrate (sand-rubble, rock-coralline,
coral, pavement, etc.) to avoid displacements and ensure
durability across the planned sampling period.
Figure 8 illustrates the main types of instruments and their
installations. A detailed summary (location, measured pa-
rameters, frequency, station depth, etc.) of all the instruments
deployed is available in the Appendix (Table A1).
4.1
Compact Temperature and Pressure sensors
Two types of compact loggers have been used to moni-
tor temperature/pressure or temperature data respectively.
First, the RBRduet T.D is a data logger constructed by
RBR Ltd (https://rbr-global.com/products/compact-loggers/
rbrduet-td/, last access: 7 April 2023) recording temperature
and pressure at high sampling frequency (continuous sam-
pling was set at 1 Hz intervals). Those precise sensors were
anchored between 8 and 12 m deep on external reef slopes
into differently exposed atoll sectors to provide sea-state pa-
rameters during post-processing steps (waves and sea level).
RBRduet T.D loggers have also been deployed inside la-
goons (6.7 to 13.5 m deep) in order to measure tide and surge
variations.
High-precision
temperature
data
were
recorded
with SBE56 sensors from SEABIRD Electronics Inc
(https://www.seabird.com/sbe-56-temperature-sensor/
product?id=54627897760, last access: 7 April 2023). De-
pending on atoll deployments, loggers were set up with a
sampled frequency of 10 s (Raroia) or 1 min (Takapoto and
Apataki).
To evaluate the temperature stratiﬁcation in the water col-
umn, two SBE56 were systematically moored on the same
station at two different depths (one sensor mostly around 2 m
and one sensor up to 40 m), plus the setting also included
one of the aforementioned RBRduet T.D moored at 6–13 m
between the SBE56.
4.2
Current proﬁlers
Two kinds of current proﬁlers were deployed in the passes or
hoa to measure current velocity and estimate the water ﬂuxes
between the ocean and the lagoon. Acoustic Doppler Current
Proﬁlers (ADCPs) were always bottom-mounted (upward-
looking mode) to measure the water column up to the sub-
surface. The number of cells was speciﬁc to each instrument
and depth of mooring. ADCPs were set to sample in burst
mode.

– ADCPs from Teledyne RD Instruments Inc. (TRD-
I) (i.e., Sentinel proﬁlers) measured current intensity
and direction across the water column according to
a pre-deﬁned number of cells, as well as pressure
and temperature related to the presence of a sen-
sor in its transducer head (Fig. 8, right image). The
cell size was set to 50 cm, 1 m or 2 m depending on
the instrument conﬁguration, and the number of cells
was dependent on the station depth. This instrument
model was deployed inside the passes (Raroia, Apataki,
Takaroa), in the lagoon close to the pass to charac-
terize lagoon areas under the pass inﬂuence (Raroia,
Apataki), or inside the lagoon away from the pass
to characterize the lagoonal wind-induced circulation
(Raroia). For each deployment, instruments were set
up with a 10 min burst frequency except for two sta-
tions in Raroia (L7 and L8) where the sampling rate
was 30 min. For Raroia, the two Sentinel V20 mod-
els and two Sentinel V50s of 1000 and 500 KHz work-
ing frequency respectively (http://www.teledynemarine.
com/workhorse-sentinel-adcp?ProductLineID=12, last
access: 7 April 2023) were moored during Leg 2 and
the “short leg”. For Apataki, two Sentinel V50s were
deployed inside passes and one V20 in the lagoon up-
stream of the southern pass. Finally, for Takaroa, only
one V20 was installed inside the pass.
– ADCPs from Nortek (i.e., Aquadopp proﬁlers) are
suitable instruments for shallow current measurements
(Fig. 8, middle image). As such, they were predom-
inantly moored inside various hoa (station depth
< 3 m). This sensor measures the pressure and 3D
velocities that allow water elevation and the speed and
direction of vertical currents to be deduced. In Raroia,
two
Aquadopp
2 MHz
(https://www.nortekgroup.
com/fr/products/aquadopp-proﬁler-2-mhz, last access:
6 April 2023) were moored inside two different hoa
with a 5 min sampling rate with a cell size equal to
20 cm and three pings per ensemble. Beam coordinate
systems for Raroia deployments were set in Cartesian
coordinates (XYZ). Two stations in Takapoto and
Apataki Atolls were also equipped with Aquadopps.
Cell size was also set to 20 cm but settings were
adjusted with 18 pings at each 10 min frequency burst
and beam coordinates were conﬁgured to measure in
Earth normal coordinates (ENUs).

Drag-tilt current meters
Marotte HS are low-cost drag-tilt current meters manu-
factured by the Marine Geophysics Laboratory of James
Cook University, Australia (https://www.marinegeophysics.
com.au/current-meter, last access: 3 April 2023). They mea-
sure temperature and velocities components (u,v) at the
instrument level (Fig. 8, middle image). Speed and direc-
tion parameters are deduced from the sensor accelerometer
and magnetometer without considering the device orienta-
tion. Sampling frequency was set to 10 s (Apataki) or 1 min
(Raroia). Marotte HS were always moored in shallow lo-
cations (< 2 m depth). During the Raroia legs, Marotte HS
were paired with Aquadopp instruments (as showed in Fig. 8)
in order to compare the measured velocity between sensors.
In Apataki, two Marotte sensors were moored on hoa along
the western side during Legs 1 and 2. A number of these
instruments were lost or failed in the course of the MANA
deployments shown in Fig. 3.
5
Data processing and quality control
The processing and protocols applied to the data sets pre-
sented herein are similar to those of Bruyère et al. (2022)
for the study of New Caledonia lagoons. For each data log-
ger type, after retrieving the data from the instruments with
the manufacturer’s software, data were post-processed us-
ing Python 3.7 routines. Data were systematically converted
into NetCDF format. Each NetCDF ﬁle contains variables
and related metadata information including global attributes.
Global attributes describe the data ensuring their reusabil-
ity by giving geospatial position, temporal coverage, sam-
pling frequency, depth, instrument serial number, investi-
gator’s name and any additional useful comments for data
users. Depending on instruments, speciﬁc processing steps
were performed (or not), namely:
– For RBRduet T.D, pressure data were corrected from
a constant atmospheric pressure (101 325 bar) in order
to avoid the inﬂuence of weather condition changes.
No vertical referencing by Differential Global Position-
ing Systems (DGPS) were achieved owing to the vicin-
ity of breaking waves in the case of forereef stations.
To deduce wave parameters (Signiﬁcant wave height,
Peak frequency and Mean wave period), data were ﬁl-
tered using the Fourier transform to acquire a pressure
spectrum (within a range of 3–25 s). Then, the meth-
ods referenced in Aucan et al. (2017) were applied us-
ing the linear wave theory with a homogenous cut-off
frequency (set to 0.33) to ﬁlter high-frequency spectra.
To calculate the water level, depth measurements were
subtracted from the mean sea level (long-term depth-
averaged of the temporal series). As a result, two output
ﬁles were created, one at 1 h resolution containing wave
parameters and another ﬁle at 1 min frequency with the
temperature and water level.
– Current meter proﬁlers (Sentinel and Aquadopps) do
not provide reliable current measurements near the sea
surface owing to contamination of the Doppler velocity
related to acoustic sidelobe reﬂections from the bound-
ary. To avoid contaminated cells, sea surface currents
data were always removed from the processed ﬁles. Ver-
tical and temporal resolutions remain dependent on de-
ployment settings. No barometric correction was ap-
plied on depth but the mean depth of the entire time
series was subtracted from data to obtain the water ele-
vation. For Raroia, Aquadopp’s coordinate system was
set to Cartesian coordinates, to be consistent with other
measures, directions were recalculated in ENU coordi-
nates using the heading orientation.

– Marotte HS data were averaged at 1 min frequency to
smooth the high-frequency ﬂuctuations. The by-default
direction convention (initially ClockWise (CW) from
east) was changed to be congruent with other instru-
ments and with the oceanographic current convention
(CW from north).
– Finally, for SBE56 instruments no speciﬁc treatments
were applied on temperature records, and ﬁnal NetCDF
ﬁles keep the raw frequency settings.
For all sensors, a visual check was performed with Fer-
ret software (http://ferret.pmel.noaa.gov/Ferret/, last access:
20 October 2023) to exclude all out-of-water data in order
to set the correct start and end of time series. The screen-
ing step also helps to detect any remaining anomalous values
(out of range values) from the processed ﬁles. If any remain-
ing anomaly is observed a speciﬁc comment in the NetCDF
Global attributes is included.

Examples of results
Examples of collected data sets on the different atolls are
provided hereafter for each category of sensor and deploy-
ment. They are by no means exhaustive (see Table A1). No
lagoon processes that require taking into account multiple
data sets are interpreted here as this makes the object of ded-
icated publications (e.g., Andréfouët et al., 2023b), but some
basic descriptive interpretations are provided here.
6.1
Water temperature records
Figure 9a illustrates water temperature time series for sta-
tions O1 and L5 stations in Raroia Atoll (Fig. 4). The 9 month
deployment in Raroia includes almost the entire 2018 win-
ter season and the 2018–2019 summer season. This example
shows the passage from the cold to the warm season (approx-
imately 26 ◦C in August–September to 30 ◦C in April). The
sampling period shows that the variations are not continu-
ously linear. Different rates of changes occur between Leg 2
and Leg 3 for instance, and there are episodes of trend in-
version (such as a period of cooling in mid-November 2018)
(Fig. 9a).
The differences between the ocean and the lagoon are
noteworthy, with the lagoon cooler than the ocean during
the winter season, and the opposite in October, when the la-
goon became warmer than the ocean. The ocean–lagoon dif-
ferences are less than 1 ◦C (−0.83 to +0.42 ◦C).
Inside the lagoon, Fig. 9b shows the surface–bottom water
temperature differences for L4, L5 and L6 stations at Raroia
Atoll (Fig. 4). The surface–bottom delta for three stations
shows that ﬂuctuations are spatially synchronous, but can be
of different amplitudes. High amplitudes reveal water col-
umn stratiﬁcation to be more intense during Leg 2 and Leg 3.
Surface temperatures are generally higher than the bottom
temperature. In some rare instances, the delta is negative,
as in three events in June 2018, September 2018 and Febru-
ary 2019 during which the bottom temperature was +0.3 ◦C

warmer than the surface. Interpretation of all these patterns
requires the use of wind data (not shown).
6.2
Current records
Figure 10 shows current intensities (m s−1) and directions
(◦N) distributed over the water column in the Takaroa Pass
(Fig. 7). The ADCP was moored at a depth of 17 m (Ta-
ble A1). Current directions (Fig. 10, middle window) in-
side the pass are vertically homogenous and follow the semi-
diurnal tide cycles (ebb and ﬂow) with a westward (red) ori-
entation during ebb and eastward (blue) during ﬂow, which
correspond to the channel orientation (see Fig. 7). Changes in
current direction are very abrupt when the tide changes, in a
matter of minutes. Current intensities (Fig. 10, ﬁrst window)
are also homogenous according to depth. The weakest cur-
rents occur during slack water corresponding to high or low
tide maximum. Figure 10 (bottom panel) shows how current
speed is related to spring tide, with a stronger outgoing cur-
rent at that time. During “normal” conditions (no meteoro-
logical or wave events), water exchanges between ocean and
lagoon through the pass are mostly driven by tide but mete-
orological events can alter the rhythm if the lagoon ﬁlls up
because of incoming swells, for instance.
6.3
Sea state parameters
Wave parameters post-processed from pressure data mea-
sured by RBRduet T.D sensors deployed in Apataki Atoll
are shown Fig. 11. The contrast between wave exposure on
the different sides of an atoll is demonstrated by station O1,
where incident wave heights ranged between 0.8 and 2 m,
and up to 4 m during the mega swell episode hitting French
Polynesia (mid-July 2022) (Andréfouët et al., 2023b). Con-
versely, the incident waves measured on the eastern station
O3 never reach above 1 m high (Fig. 11a). Water eleva-
tion measured inside the lagoon (station L02) shows the en-
try of oceanic waters especially during the mid-July 2022
mega-swell and the corresponding positive +50 cm surge
(Fig. 11c), as well as a strong distortion of the tide signal
(Fig. 11b).

Conclusions
The data sets presented in this paper come from 5 years of
investigations conducted in four speciﬁc pearl farming atolls
in the Tuamotu Archipelago (French Polynesia). Combined,
the four study sites represent one of the largest volumes
of oceanographic data collected for any atoll archipelago
worldwide. Those data inform about the inter-atoll and intra-
lagoon differences due to the replication of ﬁeld sites in
most lagoons. Intra-lagoon and ocean–lagoon temperature,
sea levels and hydrodynamics variables can be better under-
stood with this existing data set. More investigations may
nevertheless be required in different conﬁgurations to con-
tinue representing the diversity of Tuamotu and Gambier
pearl farming sites. Besides pearl farming, the data provided
here can also be useful for a variety of ecological, geomor-
phological, sedimentological and management applications.
