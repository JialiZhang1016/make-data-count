Determining the time of emergence (ToE) of detectable climate change signals against the background noise of natural variability is critical to mitigation strategies and adaptation planning.  Here, using climate model simulations, we find that the annual-mean sea surface temperature (SST) signal, mainly reflecting the tropical-mean warming, has already emerged in the historical period across much of the tropical Pacific, but appear last in the east.  The annual-mean rainfall signal of a wetter eastern tropical Pacific is expected to emerge by around mid-century based on the multi-model ensemble mean (MEM) result, with some sensitivity to emission scenario.  By contrast, the signal of ENSOrelated rainfall variability is projected to emerge by around 2040 based on the MEM regardless of emission scenario, ~ 30 years earlier than that of ENSOrelated SST variability at ~ 2070.  Our results are instructive for the detection of climate change signals in the tropical Pacific and reinforce the severe risks of ENSO-induced climate extremes that are fast emerging regardless of any mitigation actions. 



    Main Text: Hosting the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the world's largest source of interannual variability, the tropical Pacific plays a pivotal role in human-induced global climate change 1 .   How the tropical Pacific responds to rising anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs) has been one of the most important issues in the climate science [2]  [3]  [4] .   The mean state SST changes projected by coupled general circulation models (CGCMs) display, on average, a faster eastern equatorial warming than surrounding regions, characterized by a weakened west-minus-east SST gradient 5,  6 .   However, recent observations show an enhanced west-minus-east SST gradient and an eastern equatorial cooling, although the pattern of change is sensitive to the SST reconstruction used and the period over which the trend is calculated 7,  8 .   The tropical Pacific rainfall generally increases in regions where there is more SST warming than the tropical-mean-the socalled "warmer gets wetter" paradigm 4,  9 , which is accompanied by an eastward shift of the Pacific Walker circulation  10 .  

 On interannual timescales, ENSO-related SST variability (hereafter ENSO SST) is projected to increase [11]  [12]  [13]  [14] , decrease  [15]  [16]  [17] , or unchange  18,  19 , indicating a large intermodel diversity  [20]  [21]  [22] .   In contrast, the change in ENSO-related rainfall variability (hereafter ENSO rainfall) is projected to increase with a robust inter-model consensus 23- 25 , owing to increased mean-state moisture and faster warming in the eastern equatorial Pacific (EEP).   However, it remains unclear when and how these anthropogenic signals will emerge out of the large background noise of natural variability, and few studies have addressed the potential detectability of human-induced ENSO variance changes 13,  26,  27 .   This knowledge is fundamental for adaptation planning and risk assessment for affected regions 13 , which is also physically connected with other detectable signals such as the Pacific Walker circulation  [28]  [29]  [30] and sea level  [31]  [32]  [33] .   Here we use outputs of climate models participating in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) (ref. 34   ) to determine the time of emergence (ToE) of the anthropogenic climate change signal in the tropical Pacific relative to the background noise in terms of tropical mean state 21 and ENSO variability.  



 Time of Emergence of Mean SST and Rainfall Change Signals We begin by investigating the ToE of annual-mean SST based on 23 CMIP6 models under historical forcing before 2014 and various shared socio-economic pathway (SSP) emission scenarios thereafter.  This requires estimates of both signal and noise of annual-mean SST (see "Signal, noise, and ToE of annual-mean SST and rainfall" in Methods).  A map of the multi-model ensemble mean (MEM) regression coefficients, representing the response of annual-mean SST to global warming, displays a basin-wide warming in the tropical Pacific together with more warming in the EEP 35 (Fig.  1a , shaded), consistent with previous studies based on CMIP3 (ref.  36   ) and CMIP5 (ref. 5   ) models.  The spatial pattern of the noise exhibits largest values in the EEP region due to ENSO variability 6 (Fig.  1a , Contours).   The spatial pattern of the ToE of annualmean SST indicates that the climate change signal should already be detectable across almost the whole tropical Pacific, with the signal emerging last in the EEP where the noise is the largest (Fig. 1b ; Supplementary Fig.  1 ).   The distribution of the ToE and the noise have a similar pattern, with the spatial correlation of up to 0.8 in the MEM (Fig. 1b ) and being statistically significant in all individual models (Supplementary Fig.  1 ), indicating a dominant role of the noise in shaping the spatial distribution of the ToE of annual-mean SST in models.  

 On the other hand, the MEM annual-mean rainfall response to global warming displays a robust increase along the central to eastern equatorial Pacific with a high inter-model consensus, which is linked to the consistent eastward migration of the Pacific Walker circulation 10 , and there is less inter-model consistency on the flanks of the climatological Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) (Fig.  1c , shaded), in agreement with previous studies  9,  37 .  

 The MEM noise of annual-mean rainfall exhibits a pattern with large values in the central equatorial Pacific, ITCZ and SPCZ regions, and relatively small values in the EEP (Fig. 1c , contours).   The estimated MEM ToE in most models under the SSP585 scenario, indicates that the annual-mean rainfall signal can be expected to emerge within the coming decades in the EEP, although no emergent signal appears in the ITCZ and the SPCZ by the end of the 21 st century (Fig. 1d ).  

 We then focus on the EEP region where both detectable signals of annual-mean SST and rainfall emerge in the 21 st century in most models (Fig. 1b,  d ).   As shown in Given that the background noise between MEM results and observations are comparable in magnitude (Fig. 2c ), the model-observation discrepancy in the ToE of EEP annual-mean SST change is attributable to different signals (Extended Data Fig.  1a ).   Differences in signals of annual-mean SST can be further traced back to different responses of local annual-mean SST to global warming (bottom row in Fig. 2d ), as the model-observation discrepancy in the global-mean SST change is negligible (Extended Data Fig.  1b-c ).   The responses of observed annual-mean SST, though with a similar basin-wide warming, display a pattern with an enhanced west-minus-east SST gradient featuring an EEP minimum warming (Extended Data Fig. 2a-c ), in contrast to the local maximum warming in the MEM with a small inter-model difference (Fig.  1a and bottom row in Fig.  2d ).  

 To highlight the spatial variation of SST response to global warming, we further decompose the annual-mean SST into two components: the tropical-mean SST ( tm T ) 

 and the relative SST ( r T ) that is the deviation from the tropical-mean 4 .   By doing so, we find the model-observation discrepancy in the EEP annual-mean SST response to global warming is caused by the difference in the response of local r T , rather than that of tm T (top and middle rows in Fig. 2d ).   In the MEM, as well as individual models, the r T 

 shows a robust warming response in the EEP, whereas in observations there is consistent cooling response, albeit with different magnitudes (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig.  2d-g ).  

 An inter-model relationship reveals that the ToE of the EEP annual-mean SST is highly correlated to the earlier ToE (earlier than 2000 in all but one of the models) of the tm T (r=0.88,  Fig. 2e ), but not to the much later ToE (later than 2050 in all models) of the EEP r T (Fig.  2f ).   Thus, the modelled emergent signals of the EEP annual-mean SST mainly reflect signals of the tm T .  The earlier ToE of the tm T is a result of both a stronger response of the tm T (Fig. 2d ) and weaker background noise (Supplementary Fig.  3a ), while the later ToE of the r T is caused by both a weaker response of the r T (Fig.  2d ) and stronger background noise (Supplementary Fig.  3b ).  

 Given comparable ToE of tm T (Fig. 2e ) and noise of r T (Supplementary Fig.  3b ) between the MEM results and observations, the model-observation discrepancy in the ToE of annual-mean SST is thus mainly due to the widely-discussed difference between a warming response of r T in the EEP, featuring a weakened west-minus-east SST gradient in models and an opposite response in observations.   Although the cause for such opposing responses is still a matter of debate [38]  [39]  [40]  [41]  [42] , we find that both the modelled and observed responses of EEP r T are dependent on the length of the time period over which the responses are computed.   Regardless of whether the modelled EEP r T response is warming or cooling in the relatively short historical simulations, it can be warming in future projections when the time period is extended to the end of 21 st century (Extended Data Fig. 3 ).   Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that a pattern with an EEP warming response of r T featuring a weakened west-minus-east SST gradient will emerge in the future as GHGs forcing continues. 

 For rainfall in the EEP, we focus on the model outputs, as observational records are reliable only during the satellite era, thus are too short to capture the long-term global warming-induced signal 43 .   The estimated MEM ToE under different emission scenarios shows that detectable signals of annual-mean rainfall can be found around mid-century under the SSP245, SSP370 and SSP585 scenarios (in years 2070, 2054 and 2043, respectively), but not under the SSP126 scenario which features the lowest GHGs forcing (Fig. 3a ).   For individual models under the most aggressive SSP585 scenario, all models but two show detectable signals of annual-mean rainfall by the end of 21 st century, while all models but two do not show detectable signals before 2020 (Fig. 3b ), suggesting a robust inter-model consensus of the undetectability of an annual-mean rainfall signal by now.   The inter-model difference in the ToE of annual-mean rainfall, with signals emerging as early as before 2020 in a few models (such as CanESM5) and as late as after 2080 in other models (such as MPI-ESM1-2-LR), is larger than that of annual-mean SST.  Nevertheless, the estimated ToE of EEP annualmean rainfall is later than that of annual-mean SST in all models by several decades (Fig. 2b,  3b ).  

 To investigate the cause of a later ToE of annual-mean rainfall, we decompose rainfall change into a thermodynamic component ( q     ) due to moisture change, and a dynamic component ( q    ) due to circulation change based on a simplified moisture budget analysis 37 .   The result indicates that the weak response of annual-mean rainfall in the ITCZ and SPCZ is caused by an offsetting effect between a positive response of the thermodynamic component and a negative response of the dynamic component, while the robust positive response of EEP annual-mean rainfall is almost entirely due to the dynamic component-an equatorial and eastward shift in rainfall (Supplementary Fig. 4 ), in agreement with previous studies  24,  25 .   As such, the ToE of EEP annual-mean rainfall appears to not be influenced by the thermodynamic component (Fig. 3c,  d ).   Rather, it is almost totally determined by the ToE of dynamic component, with the inter-model correlation coefficient between the two being up to 0.97 (Fig. 3e ).  

 The response of the EEP q    is controlled by an ascending circulation response, which is driven by a local positive warming response of r T (Supplementary Fig. 4b , contours), suggestive of the "warmer gets wetter" paradigm  4,  37 .   The significant inter-model relationship between the response of q    and r T and the insignificant relationship with tm T in the EEP (Extended Data Fig. 4 ) further confirms that it is the r T , rather than the tm T , that plays an important role in the response of EEP q    .   This contributes to a later ToE of annual-mean rainfall compared with that of the annual-mean SST, which mainly reflects the early ToE of the tropical-mean SST (Fig. 2e ).   Likewise, we would expect the signal of observed annual-mean rainfall to emerge later than the signal of observed annual-mean SST. 



 Time of Emergence of ENSO SST and Rainfall Change Signals ENSO dominates interannual climate variability in the tropical Pacific, displaying anomalous SST and rainfall over the central to eastern equatorial Pacific 44,  45 .   The CMIP6 MEM results for the reference pattern over 1960 to 1989, capture the common features of ENSO (Fig. 4a,  b ), although there are common biases such as an excessive westward extension of ENSO SST and rainfall  46,  47 .   The map of MEM regression coefficients under the four SSP scenarios, representing the response of ENSO SST to global warming (see "Signal, noise and ToE of ENSO SST and rainfall" in Methods), all display an enhancement in SST variability, as well as a westward-shift relative to the reference pattern, with a robust inter-model agreement (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig.  5a-c ).   The modelled enhanced ENSO SST response is consistent with the observations, although the westward-shifts are hard to detect in the limited historical period in observations (Extended Data Fig. 5d-f ).   The MEM response of ENSO rainfall, on the other hand, displays a consistent enhancement and an eastward-shift relative to the reference pattern 23,  24 (Fig.  4d and Extended Data Fig.  5g-i ).  

 To capture the commonality of the spatial distribution of ENSO ToE for most models, the MEM results of ENSO SST and rainfall ToE are shown by averaging model results only when more than 70% of models have local emergent signals before the last 30-year time window of 21 st century (Fig. 4e,  f ).   The results indicate that both emergent signals of ENSO SST and rainfall change are confined to the equatorial region and are not detectable by now.  The MEM ToE of the ENSO SST signal is located to the west of the referenced ENSO SST center (Fig. 4e ), while the MEM ToE of the ENSO rainfall signal is located to the east of the referenced ENSO rainfall center (Fig.  4f ).   Thus, besides the increased amplitude responses to global warming, the pattern shifts of both ENSO SST and rainfall contribute to their respective times of emergence. 

 To confirm, we decompose the response of grid-point ENSO SST and rainfall to global warming into two components: the amplitude response and the structural response.  The former depicts the intensity change by assuming that the spatial pattern under global warming is fixed, while the latter indicates shifts in spatial pattern (see "Separation of amplitude and structural changes in ENSO SST and rainfall" in Methods).  For ENSO SST, the increased amplitude response plays a greater role than the response of structural change (Supplementary Fig. 5a,  b ).   In contrast, for ENSO rainfall, the eastward-shifted structural response plays a more important role in the ENSO rainfall response compared with the increased amplitude response (Supplementary Fig. 5c,  d ).  

 A comparison between the ToE of ENSO SST and rainfall change signals in the EEP reveals that the modelled ToE of ENSO rainfall signal is generally earlier than that of ENSO SST signal by several decades (Fig. 5a-d ), which is opposite to the ToE behavior of the annual-mean SST and rainfall change signals.   In the MEM, the ENSO SST signal is expected to emerge under both the SSP585 and SSP370 scenarios in the 30-year time windows ending at 2070 and 2073, respectively, but not under the other two lower scenarios (SSP126 and SSP245) (Fig. 5a ), indicative of some sensitivity to emission scenarios.   The ToE of ENSO rainfall, however, is projected to be in this century under all the SSP126, SSP245, SSP370 and SSP585 scenarios in the 30-year time windows ending at 2039, 2045, 2042 and 2037, respectively, separated by less than a decade (Fig. 5b ).   Under SSP585 and SSP370 scenarios, ToE of ENSO rainfall is ~ 30 years earlier than that of ENSO SST. 

 As exemplified by the results projected under the SSP585 scenario, the estimated ToE of ENSO rainfall is also earlier than that of ENSO SST in most individual models (Fig. 5c,  d and Supplementary Fig.  6 ).   For ENSO SST, 17 out of 23 (around 74%) models show a ToE before the end of the 21 st century (Fig. 5c ), while for ENSO rainfall, all but one model (INM-CM5-0) shows the signal emerging (Fig.  5d ).   A large intermodel spread exists in the ToE of both ENSO SST and rainfall, with the inter-model standard deviation up to 50 years (Fig. 5c,  d ), which, however, does not change our result of an earlier ToE of ENSO rainfall than ENSO SST.   Thus, the signal of ENSOrelated variability change, when measured by rainfall 6,  24 , is stronger and will emerge earlier as compared to that measured by SST.  

 To explore the cause of an earlier ToE of ENSO rainfall, we decompose ENSO rainfall change into a thermodynamic component ( c q     ) due to climatological moisture change, and a dynamic component ( c q    ) due to ENSO-driven atmospheric circulation change 15 (see "Decomposition of 30-year climatological SST and ENSO rainfall change" in Methods).   The responses of both thermodynamic and dynamic components contribute to the increase in ENSO rainfall in the EEP, with the latter playing the major role (supplementary Fig. 7 ).   Thus, the ToE of ENSO rainfall appears to be dominated by the ToE of dynamic component (Fig. 5e ), while the much earlier ToE of thermodynamic component (Fig.  5f ), though playing a minor role, hastens the ToE of ENSO rainfall (Extended Data Fig.  6a ).   The ToE of dynamic component of ENSO rainfall, on the other hand, is controlled by that of the climatological relative SST change, with an inter-model correlation coefficient between the two reaching up to 0.69 (Fig. 5g ), indicating a "warmer gets wetter" paradigm on interannual timescale  48,  49 .   As the ToE of climatological relative SST change is earlier than that of ENSO SST (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig.  6b ), the ToE of ENSO rainfall is also earlier.   In addition, the insensitivity of the ToE of ENSO rainfall to emission scenarios is attributable to the climatological relative SST change, which is also insensitive to emission scenarios (Extended Data Fig. 6b ).  



 Implications for Emergence of Rainfall Signals Our estimations for ToE of annual-mean rainfall in the EEP based on MEM reveal that they are dependent on the future emission scenarios, with signals emerging as early as before 2050 under the SSP585 scenario; by contrast, annual-mean rainfall is undetectable by the end of this century under the lowest SSP126 scenario (Fig. 3a ).   This implies that climate mitigation could be effective in preventing significant rainfall shifts in the mean state.  However, the estimated MEM ToE of ENSO rainfall are only a few years apart in the different emission scenarios (Fig. 5b ).   Hence, we would expect to detect a significant signal of ENSO rainfall change before 2050 even if we follow a strong mitigation pathway such as the SSP126 or SSP245 scenarios.  Considering that ENSO rainfall is the main driver of global ENSO teleconnections, via heating of the atmosphere and the propagation of atmospheric waves to both the tropics and extratropics 50 , the emergent ENSO rainfall change signal could trigger wide-ranging impacts on natural and human systems.  



 Summary and Caveats Our results indicate that the annual-mean SST signal emerges earlier than the annual-mean rainfall, whereas the ENSO-related rainfall signal emerges earlier than the ENSO-related SST signal, are robust in most individual models as well as in their aggregation.  We note that the estimated ToE could be affected by model biases.  For example, the difference between the observed enhancement and a modelled weakening in the equatorial Pacific west-minus-east SST gradient likely affects the ToE of annualmean SST (Fig. 2b,  d ).   However, as we have shown, the possibility that a pattern with a weakened west-minus-east SST gradient should not be excluded in the future real world, given that all models generate SST warming in the EEP in the future with more The Hadley Center Sea Ice and SST version 1.1 (HadISSTv1) (ref. 53   ), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Extended Reconstructed SST version 5 (ERSSTv5) (ref. 54   ), and the Centennial In Situ Observation-Based Estimates of the Variability of SST and Marine Meteorological Variables version 2 (COBEv2) (ref. 55   ) for the period 1870-2019.  Here we choose the starting year as 1870 in both models and observations to include the global warming signal as much as possible, but note that there are uncertainties in the SST observational datasets due to the sparse data coverage in the early stage of the records 7 .   However, our main conclusions hardly change if a different starting time between 1870 and 1950 is chosen, since the global warming signals are relatively small before 1950 (Extended Data Fig. 1c ).  

 We take 30 years of the 1960-1989 period as our reference period, as we find good consistency between observational SST datasets in this period.  All changes under global warming are calculated by removing the associated values in that reference period. 



 Annual-mean values are calculated simply by averaging the monthly values from January to December.  Interannual anomaly fields are obtained by removing the climatological annual cycle of the chosen period and then quadratic de-trending 56 the monthly values over the chosen period.   T ) that is the deviation from the tropical-mean SST  4,  58 .   The annual-mean rainfall change can be decomposed, from a simplified water vapor budget with the negligible non-linear term removed, into the changes in thermodynamic and dynamic component 37,  59 :

The term q    3 )) that are positive (negative), and the signals continue to exceed the defined threshold value beyond that time.   Note that choosing a different ensemble member run for individual models, say r2i1p1f1, does change the results of estimated ToE of ENSO SST and rainfall for individual models, but our main conclusions do not change, especially considering that they are based on the MEM results.  In addition, although the times of emergence of ENSO SST and rainfall do change if a different time window, say a 40-year or 50-year time window, is chosen (the longer the time window, the earlier the ToE of ENSO SST and rainfall), our main conclusion of an earlier ToE of ENSO rainfall than that of ENSO SST also doesn't change. 

 For observations, calculation of the signal of ENSO SST is the same as for models except that it is based on the period 1870-2019.  But when calculating the noise, we first remove the least squares quadratic trend of the monthly SST value for the whole period 1870-2019, and the remaining is treated as the unforced data, which is analogous to the output in piControl run in models.  Then the changes in ENSO SST in each 30year time window moving forward by one year from the remaining unforced data relative to the reference period of 1960-1989 are calculated to represent the noise.  In To illustrate, we use one model (EC-Earth3-Veg) and one observational SST (HadISSTv1) and specify a grid-point (0°, 120°W) to give a brief description of how to estimate the ToE of ENSO SST (Supplementary Fig. 8 ).   The ENSO rainfall change can be decomposed, from a simplified water vapor budget with negligible terms removed, into the changes in thermodynamic and dynamic component 15 : cc ( , , ) ~( , , ) ( , ) ( , ) ( , , ) P x y t x y t q x y x y q x y t 

 Fig. 2a , 2a  Fig. 2a, the MEM annual-mean SST signals emerge at around 2015 under all four 



     GHGs forcing regardless of their behaviors in the historical simulations.  The second source of uncertainty is a large inter-model difference in the exact ToE, owing to differences either in the background noise of natural variability, the climate change signals in response to global warming, or both.  Thirdly, the estimated ToE in a specific model could be different in different ensemble member runs with different initial conditions in which decadal to multi-decadal internal variability such as the interdecadal Pacific oscillation 8,51,52 is different.  However, the MEM results, which are the basis of our conclusions, are robust and insensitive to choosing different ensemble members.  Despite these caveats, our result of an earlier ToE of annual-mean SST than annual mean rainfall suggests that focus should be placed on the tropical mean SST for detection of mean state change in the tropical Pacific.  In addition, our result of a ToE of ENSO rainfall, ~30 years earlier than ENSO SST and insensitive to different emission scenarios, highlights the potential risks of extreme events associated with ENSO rainfall change and the associated ENSO teleconnections.  Methods CMIP6 models, observed datasets, and processing.  We use the historical runs for the period 1870-2014, the four tier-one SSP (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370 and SSP585) scenario runs for the period 2015-2099, and the pre-industrial control (piControl) run for the last 500 years from 23 CMIP6 models 34 .  They are ACCESS-CM2, ACCESS-ESM1-5, BCC-CSM2-MR, CanESM5, CESM2-WACCM, CNRM-CM6-1-HR, CNRM-CM6-1, CNRM-ESM2-1, EC-Earth3-Veg, FGOALS-f3-L, FGOALS-g3, GFDL-ESM4, GISS-E2-1-G, INM-CM4-8, INM-CM5-0, IPSL-CM6A-LR, MIROC-ES2L, MIROC6, MPI-ESM1-2-HR, MPI-ESM1-2-LR, MRI-ESM2-0, NorESM2-LM, NorESM2-MM.  Note that we have only 499 years in model CESM2-WACCM and 300 years in model CNRM-CM6-1-HR in piControl run.  For each model, we use one ensemble member run (r1i1p1f1) but test the sensitivity to using different members (see "Signal, noise and ToE of ENSO SST and rainfall" below).  Monthly outputs are used of surface temperature (ts, which is SST for open ocean), rainfall (pr), surface air specific humidity (huss), and vertical pressure velocity (wap) at 500hPa.  All the model outputs are bilinear interpolated into a 2.5° × 2.5° grid before analyses.  To investigate ToE of observed SSTs, we use three different observational SST datasets: 



   .   SST and rainfall.  To estimate the signal of modelled annual-mean SST, we calculate the response of annual-mean SST to global warming.  The global warming signal is taken as the annual-mean SST change from the reference period of 1960-1989 averaged over the 60°S-60°N domain and then smoothed by fitting a fourth order polynomial 57 (Extended Data Fig.1b, c)Here we choose the average of SST from 60°S to 60°N to remove inconsistencies caused by sea ice in observational SSTs but not in modelled surface temperature (ts).   Nevertheless, our conclusions do not change if a different domain, say 90°S-90°N, is chosen to compute the global warming signal.  The signal of grid-point annual-mean SST, AM-SST ( , , ) S x y t , is obtained by regressing grid-point annual-mean SST change onto the smoothed global warming time series () Tt: a is the regression coefficient between () Tt and annual-mean SST, representing the response of annual-mean SST to global warming (Fig.1a), and b is the intercept.The noise of grid-point annual-mean SST, AM-SST ( , ) N x y , is defined as the interannual standard deviation of annual-mean SST, which is based on the last 500 years of the piControl run.  In observations, calculation of the signal of grid-point annual-mean SST is the same as that in the models except that it is based on the period 1870-2019, while the noise of observational annual-mean SST is obtained by calculating standard deviation of the annual-mean SST after the signal is removed 32 .   Modelled signal ( AM-rainfall ( , , ) S x y t ) and noise ( AM-rainfall ( , ) N x y ) of annual-mean rainfall are similarly calculated.The ToE of grid-point annual-mean SST is defined as the year when the grid-point signal-to-noise ratio of annual-mean SST, AM-SST AM-SST /SN, is higher (lower) than 1.0 (-1.0) and all subsequent AM-SST AM-SST / SN stay higher (lower) than 1.0 (-1.0) if the local response of annual-mean SST to global warming ( ( , ) a x y ) is positive (negative), as in a previous study 57 .   Calculation for the modelled ToE of annual-mean rainfall is similar to that for annual-mean SST.  The ToE in the EEP is obtained by firstly averaging the signal-to-noise ratio as well as the noise spatially and then calculating it using the method above.  Note that the chosen threshold value of AM-SST AM-SST / SN for a detectable annual-mean signal is somewhat subjective.  If a larger threshold, say 2.0 (-2.0), is chosen 57 , the estimated times of emergence of annual-mean SST and rainfall would be later by around 20-30 years (not shown), but our result of an earlier ToE of annual-mean SST compared with that of annual-mean rainfall does not change.  Decomposition of annual-mean SST and rainfall change.  The annual-mean SST change from the reference period in each grid point can be decomposed into a tropicalmean SST ( tm T ) change averaged over 20°S to 20°N and a relative SST ( r 



     is the dynamic component of annual-mean rainfall change, which represents the contributions of atmospheric circulation change, while the term q     is the thermodynamic component of annual-mean rainfall change, which represents the contributions of moisture change 60 .  The combination of dynamic and thermodynamic components in equation (2) defines the reconstructed annual-mean rainfall change.  Signal, noise, and ToE of ENSO SST and rainfall.  Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis is used to extract the spatial pattern of ENSO SST in each model and observations in the tropical Pacific (20°S-20°N, 120°E-80°W).  For each model, the EOF analysis is performed on interannual anomalies of each 30-year time window moving forward by one year starting from 1870 to 2099, generating an evolution of 30year running variability for time from 1899 to 2099 (recorded as the ending year of each 30-year time window), SST e 



     an 1870-2019 period, we can obtain 121 samples of such change, which are analogous to the 471 samples of SST e-pi ( , , ) EN x y t  in each model.  The ToE of observational ENSO SST is estimated by making a comparison between the signal of ENSO SST and the above 121 samples of ENSO SST change in a similar statistical way as in models. 



     . A separation of ENSO rainfall change is carried out similarly to that of ENSO SST change.  Decomposition of 30-year climatological SST and ENSO rainfall change.  As the annual-mean SST change, each of the 30-year climatological-mean SST change from the reference period ending from 1899 to 2099 in each grid point can be decomposed into a tropical-mean climatological SST change averaged over 20°S to 20°N and a climatological relative SST change that is the deviation from the tropical-mean change. 



     , where  denotes the change relative to the value in the reference period; the prime denotes ENSO-related interannual variability; the overbar denotes the climatological value in the reference period 1960-1989; c q is 30-year climatological surface specific humidity and  denotes the ENSO-driven vertical motion variability at 500hPa.  The term c q    is the dynamic component of ENSO rainfall change, which represents the contributions of ENSO-driven atmospheric circulation change, while the term c q     is the thermodynamic component of ENSO rainfall change, which represents the contributions of climatological moisture change 15 .  The combination of dynamic and thermodynamic components in equation (6) defines the reconstructed ENSO rainfall change.

    The calculation for the modelled ToE of ENSO rainfall is similar to that for ENSO SST.The estimated times of emergence of ENSO SST and rainfall could be different when choosing different threshold values for signals, but the main conclusions, such as an earlier ToE of ENSO rainfall than that of ENSO SST and both the ToE of ENSO SST and rainfall are not yet detectable, do not change when other threshold values, for example, the 95% (5%) or 97.5% (2.5%), are chosen (Supplementary Table.1).
