Abstract 
25 
Future changes in both the mean climate of the tropical Pacific and 
26 
characteristics of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are now established 
27 
as being likely. Determining the time of emergence (ToE) of detectable climate 
28 
change signals against background noise of natural variability is critical to 
29 
mitigation strategies and adaptation planning. Here, we find that the annual-mean 
30 
SST signal, mainly reflecting the tropical-mean warming signal, has already 
31 
emerged in the historical period across much of the tropical Pacific, with the latest 
32 
ToE in the east. The annual-mean rainfall signal is expected to emerge by around 
33 
mid-century based on the multi-model ensemble mean (MEM) result, with some 
34 
sensitivity to emission scenarios. By contrast, the signal of ENSO-related rainfall 
35 
variability is projected to emerge by around 2040±3 based on the MEM regardless 
36 
of emission scenarios, ~ 30 years sooner than that of the ENSO-related SST 
37 
variability. Our results are instructive for detection of climate change signals in 
38 
the tropical Pacific and reinforce the severe risks of ENSO-induced climate 
39 
extremes that are fast emerging regardless of any mitigation actions.

Main Text: 
43 
Hosting the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the world’s largest source of 
44 
interannual variability, the tropical Pacific plays a pivotal role in human-induced global 
45 
climate change1. How the tropical Pacific responds to rising anthropogenic greenhouse 
46 
gases (GHGs) has been one of the most important issues of climate2-4 . Projected SST 
47 
changes from coupled general circulation models (CGCMs) display on average a faster 
48 
eastern equatorial warming than surrounding regions, characterized by a weakened 
49 
west-minus-east SST gradient4-7. However, recent observations display an enhanced 
50 
west-minus-east SST gradient and an eastern equatorial cooling, although the pattern 
51 
of change is sensitive to SST reconstruction used and the period over which the trend 
52 
is calculated8,9. The tropical mean-state rainfall generally increases in regions where 
53 
there is more SST warming than the tropical-mean—the so-called “warmer gets wetter” 
54 
paradigm4. 
55 
On interannual timescales, the change in ENSO-related SST variability (hereafter 
56 
ENSO SST) is projected as being likely7,10,11, although large inter-model diversity 
57 
exits12-16. While the change in ENSO-related rainfall variability (hereafter ENSO 
58 
rainfall) is projected to increase with a robust inter-model consensus17-22, owing to 
59 
increased mean-state moisture and faster warming in the eastern equatorial Pacific 
60 
(EEP). 
61 
However, it remains unclear when these anthropogenic signal will emerge out of 
62 
the large background noise of natural variability, and - to our knowledge - only one 
63 
study has addressed the potential detectability of human-induced ENSO variance 
64 
changes23. The knowledge is fundamental for adaptation planning and risk assessment 
65 
for affected regions. Here we use outputs of climate models participating in Coupled 
66 
 
 
5 
Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) (ref. 24) to determine the time of 
67 
emergence (ToE) of the anthropogenic climate change signal in the tropical Pacific 
68 
relative to the background noise in terms of tropical mean state change21 and ENSO 
69 
SST and rainfall. 
70 
Time of Emergence of Mean SST and Rainfall Change Signals 
71 
We begin by investigating the ToE of annual-mean SST based on 23 CMIP6 
72 
models under historical forcing before 2014 and various shared socioeconomic pathway 
73 
(SSP) emission scenarios thereafter (see “CMIP6 models, observed datasets, and 
74 
processing” in Methods), which requires estimates of both signal and noise of annual-
75 
mean SST. The annual-mean SST signal over the 1870 to 2099 period is calculated by 
76 
regressing grid-point annual-mean SST change from the 1870–1899 reference period 
77 
onto the time series of global warming SST change that is smoothed by fitting a fourth 
78 
order polynomial (see “Signal, noise, and ToE of annual-mean SST and rainfall” in 
79 
Methods). Map of multi-model ensemble mean (MEM) regression coefficients, 
80 
representing the response of annual-mean SST to global warming, displays a basin-
81 
wide warming in the tropical Pacific together with more warming in the EEP (Fig. 1a, 
82 
shaded), consistent with previous studies based on CMIP3 (ref. 25,26) or CMIP5 (ref. 5,27) 
83 
models. Background natural variability is taken as the noise for annual-mean SST 
84 
change signal and represented by the interannual standard deviation of SST computed 
85 
from 500-year-long experiments under a constant pre-industrial CO2 level (piControl), 
86 
Spatial pattern of the noise exhibits largest values in the EEP region due to ENSO 
87 
variability (Fig. 1a, Contours). 
88 
The ToE of annual-mean SST, defined at each grid point as the first time the signal 
89 
of SST change is greater than the noise28, indicates that the climate change signal is 
90 
 
 
6 
already detectable across the whole tropical Pacific, with the signal having emerged 
91 
latest in the EEP (Fig. 1b; Supplementary Fig. 1). The distribution of the ToE and the 
92 
noise have a similar pattern, with the spatial correlation up to 0.91 in MEM (Fig. 1b) 
93 
and being all statistically significant in individual models (Supplementary Fig. 1), 
94 
indicating a dominant role of the noise in shaping the spatial distribution of the ToE of 
95 
annual-mean SST in models. 
96 
On the other hand, the MEM annual-mean rainfall response to global warming 
97 
displays a robust increase along the central to eastern equatorial Pacific with a high 
98 
inter-model consensus, and there is hardly any signal that has inter-model consistency 
99 
on the flanks where the climatological Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and 
100 
South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) are located (Fig. 1c, shaded). The MEM noise 
101 
of annual-mean rainfall exhibits a pattern with large values in the central equatorial 
102 
Pacific, ITCZ and SPCZ regions, and a local minimum in the EEP (Fig. 1c, contours). 
103 
The estimated MEM ToE in most models under the SSP585 scenario, indicates that the 
104 
annual-mean rainfall signal can be expected to emerge within the coming decades in 
105 
the EEP, although no emergent signal appears in the ITCZ and the SPCZ by the end of 
106 
the 21st century (Fig. 1d). 
107 
We then focus on the EEP region where both detectable signals of annual-mean 
108 
SST and rainfall emerge in most models (Fig. 1b, d). The ToE of EEP annual-mean 
109 
value is defined as when the spatial-mean of grid-point signal-to-noise ratio is greater 
110 
than 1.0 for the first time. As shown in Fig. 2a. the annual-mean SST signals, calculated 
111 
based on the MEM under all the four emission scenarios, emerge at around the year 
112 
2000, sooner than the ToE in the three sets of SST observations. For individual models 
113 
under the SSP585 scenario, 19 out of 23 models already have detectable annual-mean 
114 
SST signals in the EEP before 2020, with signals emerging as early as the 1980s in a 
115 
 
 
7 
few models (Fig. 2b). The spatial patterns of the ToE of the observed annual-mean SST 
116 
show the signal emerging in parts of the tropical Pacific by 2019 but not, in general, in 
117 
the EEP (Supplementary Fig. 2). The observed SST from COBEv2 shows the largest 
118 
spatial coverage of emergence (Supplementary Fig. 2c) and indicates emergence of the 
119 
signal averaged over the EEP (Fig. 2b). The differences in ToE of annual-mean SST 
120 
among three observational datasets suggest that observational uncertainties play a 
121 
role8,29. 
122 
Given that the background noise (Fig. 2c) and smoothed global-mean SST change 
123 
(Supplementary Fig. 3) between MEM results and observations are both comparable in 
124 
magnitude, the model-observation discrepancy in the ToE of EEP annual-mean SST 
125 
signal seems to be mainly attributable to different responses of local annual-mean SST 
126 
to global warming (Fig. 2d). The responses of observed annual-mean SST, though with 
127 
a similar basin-wide warming, display a pattern with an enhanced west-minus-east SST 
128 
gradient featuring an EEP minimum warming (Supplementary Fig. 4a–c), in contrast to 
129 
the local maximum warming in the MEM with a small inter-model difference (Fig. 1a, 
130 
Fig. 2d). 
131 
We decompose the annual-mean SST into two components: the tropical-mean SST 
132 
(
) and the relative SST (
) that is the deviation from the tropical-mean4 (see 
133 
“Decomposition of annual-mean SST and rainfall change” in Methods). By doing so, 
134 
we find the model-observation difference in the EEP annual-mean SST response to 
135 
global warming is caused by the difference in the response of local 
, rather than that 
136 
of 
 (Fig. 2d). In the MEM as well as individual models, the 
 shows a robust 
137 
warming response in the EEP, whereas in observations there is consistent cooling 
138 
response, albeit with different magnitudes (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. 4d–g). Note

8 
that 4 out of 23 models do not show a detectable signal in the EEP by the year 2020 
140 
(Fig. 2b), which could be due to stronger simulated background noise (Fig. 2c), rather 
141 
than a weaker local response of annual-mean SST to global warming (Fig. 2d). 
142 
An inter-model relationship reveals that the ToE of the EEP annual-mean SST is 
143 
highly correlated to the earlier ToE of the 
 (r=0.89, Fig. 2e), but not to the much 
144 
later ToE of the EEP 
, which emerges in only about half of the 23 models (Fig. 2f). 
145 
Thus the modelled emergent signals of the EEP annual-mean SST mainly reflect signals 
146 
of the 
. The earlier ToE of the 
 is a result of both a stronger response of the 
147 
 (Fig. 2d) and weaker background noise (Supplementary Fig. 5a), while the later 
148 
ToE of the 
 is caused by both a weaker response of the 
 (Fig. 2d) and stronger 
149 
background noise (Supplementary Fig. 5b). 
150 
Given comparable ToE of 
 (Fig. 2e) and noise of 
 (Supplementary Fig. 5b) 
151 
between the MEM results and observations, the model-observation discrepancy in the 
152 
ToE of annual-mean SST is thus mainly due to the much-discussed difference between 
153 
a warming response of 
 in the EEP featuring a weakened west-minus-east SST 
154 
gradient in models and an opposite response in observations. Although cause for such 
155 
opposite response is still a matter of debate30,31, we find that both the modelled and 
156 
observed responses of EEP 
 are dependent on the length of the time period over 
157 
which the responses are computed. Regardless of whether the modelled EEP 
 
158 
response is warming or cooling in historical simulations, it can be warming in future 
159 
projections when the time period is extended to the end of 21st century (Supplementary 
160 
Fig. 6). Thus, a pattern with an EEP warming response of 
 featuring a weakened 
161 
west-minus-east SST gradient should not be excluded in the future real world.

For rainfall in the EEP, we focus on the model outputs, as observational records 
163 
are reliable only during the satellite era, thus too short to capture the long-term global 
164 
warming-induced signal. The estimated MEM ToE under different emission scenarios 
165 
shows that detectable signals of annual-mean rainfall can be found in around mid-
166 
century under the SSP245, SSP370 and SSP585 scenarios (in years 2059, 2047 and 
167 
2038, respectively), but not under the SSP126 scenario which features the lowest GHGs 
168 
forcing (Fig. 3a). For individual models under the SSP585 scenario, all models show 
169 
detectable signals of annual-mean rainfall by the end of 21st century, but 19 out of 23 
170 
models show them after 2020 (Fig. 3b), suggesting a robust inter-model consensus of 
171 
the not yet detectable signal of annual-mean rainfall. The inter-model difference of ToE 
172 
for annual-mean rainfall, with signals emerging as early as before 2010 in a few models 
173 
(such as CanESM5) and as late as after 2080 in other models (such as GISS-E2-1-G), 
174 
is larger than that for annual-mean SST. Nevertheless, the estimated ToE of EEP annual-
175 
mean rainfall is later than that of annual-mean SST in all models by several decades 
176 
(Fig. 2b, 3b). 
177 
To investigate the cause of the later ToE of annual-mean rainfall, we decompose 
178 
rainfall change into a thermodynamic component (
) due to moisture change, 
179 
and a dynamic component (
) due to circulation change based on a simplified 
180 
moisture budget analysis32,33 (see “Decomposition of annual-mean SST and rainfall 
181 
change” in Methods). The result indicates that the weak response of annual-mean 
182 
rainfall in the ITCZ and SPCZ is caused by an offsetting effect between a positive 
183 
response of thermodynamic component and a negative response of dynamic component, 
184 
while the robust positive response of EEP annual-mean rainfall is almost entirely due 
185 
to the dynamic component—an equatorial and eastward shift in rainfall (Supplementary 
186 
Fig. 7). As such, the ToE of EEP annual-mean rainfall appears to not be influenced by 
187

- ×D

10 
the thermodynamic component of rainfall (Fig. 3c–d). Rather, it is almost totally 
188 
determined by the ToE of dynamic component of rainfall, with the inter-model 
189 
correlation coefficient between the two being up to 0.98 (Fig. 3e). 
190 
The response of EEP dynamic rainfall is controlled by an ascending circulation 
191 
response, which is driven by a local positive warming response of 
 (Supplementary 
192 
Fig. 7b, contours), suggestive of the “warmer gets wetter” paradigm4,32. The significant 
193 
(insignificant) inter-model relationship between the response of 
 and 
 
194 
(
) in the EEP (Supplementary Fig. 8) further verifies that it is the 
, rather than 
195 
the 
, that plays an important role in the response of EEP dynamic rainfall, 
196 
contributing to a later ToE of annual-mean rainfall compared with that of the annual-
197 
mean SST. Likewise, we would expect the signal of observed annual-mean rainfall, if 
198 
reliable records are long enough, to emerge later than the signal of observed annual-
199 
mean SST. 
200 
Time of Emergence of ENSO SST and Rainfall Change Signals 
201 
ENSO dominates interannual climate variability in the tropical Pacific, displaying 
202 
anomalous SST and rainfall over the central to eastern equatorial Pacific34,35. The MEM 
203 
results of ENSO SST and rainfall in the reference period of 1870-1899, as diagnosed 
204 
from an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis on interannual SST anomalies in 
205 
the 30-year period (see “ENSO-related SST and rainfall variability” in Methods), 
206 
capture the common features of ENSO patterns (Fig. 4a, b), although there are common 
207 
biases such as an excessive westward extension of ENSO SST and rainfall36,37. 
208 
To diagnose signal of ENSO SST in response to global warming in each model, 
209 
we applied EOF analysis to SST anomalies in each 30-year time window moving

forward by one year ending in 1899 to 2099 (recorded as the ending year of the window). 
211 
The application produces an evolution of grid-point ENSO SST change from that of the 
212 
reference period over the 1899 to 2099 period. Similarly, the evolution of global 
213 
warming signal from the reference period is constructed by 30-year running averages 
214 
of the yearly time series, producing an evolution from 1899-2099, which is then 
215 
smoothed by fitting a fourth order polynomial. Evolution of grid-point ENSO SST 
216 
signal is obtained by regressing the evolution of the 30-year running grid-point ENSO 
217 
SST change onto the evolution of smoothed 30-year running global warming signal (see 
218 
“Signal, noise and ToE of ENSO SST and rainfall” in Methods). 
219 
The map of MEM regression coefficients under the four SSP scenarios all display 
220 
an enhancement in SST variability, as well as a westward-shift relative to the reference 
221 
pattern, with a robust inter-model agreement (Fig. 4c; Supplementary Fig. 9a–c), 
222 
indicating the presence of the signal. The modelled enhanced ENSO SST response is 
223 
consistent with the observations, although the westward-shifts are hard to detect in the 
224 
limited historical period in observations (Supplementary Fig. 9d–f). Similar analysis 
225 
conducted for ENSO rainfall and their MEM responses, on the other hand, displays a 
226 
consistent enhancement and an eastward-shift relative to the background pattern17,18 
227 
(Fig. 4d; Supplementary Fig. 9g–i). 
228 
Noise of ENSO SST and rainfall in each model is diagnosed from EOF analysis 
229 
of each running 30-year ENSO SST and rainfall interannual anomalies, increasing by 
230 
one year, in a 500-year long piControl experiments. The EOF analysis generates 471 
231 
realizations of 30-year running grid-point ENSO SST and rainfall for 471 realizations 
232 
of change from the 1870-1899 reference period for each model. 
233 
The ToE of ENSO SST and rainfall change signals is defined as the 30-year 
234 
 
 
12 
window when the grid-point signal first exceeds to the 99 percentile (1 percentile) value 
235 
of the noise for the local ENSO SST response to global warming that is positive 
236 
(negative). The MEM results of times of emergence of ENSO SST and rainfall, 
237 
calculated by averaging model results only when more than 70% models have local 
238 
emergent signals before 2099, show that both signals of ENSO SST and rainfall change 
239 
are confined to the equatorial region, and are not yet detectable (Fig. 4e, f). The MEM 
240 
ToE of the ENSO SST signal is located to the west of the referenced ENSO SST center 
241 
(Fig. 4e), while the MEM ToE of the ENSO rainfall signal is located to the east of the 
242 
referenced ENSO rainfall center (Fig. 4f). Thus, besides the increased amplitude 
243 
responses to global warming, the pattern shifts of both ENSO SST and rainfall play an 
244 
important role in their respective ToE. 
245 
To confirm, we decompose the response of grid-point ENSO SST and rainfall to 
246 
global warming into two components: the amplitude response and the structural 
247 
response. The former depicts the intensity change by assuming that the spatial pattern 
248 
under global warming is fixed, while the latter indicates shifts in spatial pattern (see 
249 
“Separation of amplitude and structural changes in ENSO SST and rainfall” in 
250 
Methods). For ENSO SST, the increased amplitude response and the westward-shifted 
251 
structural response make comparable contributions to the total signal of ENSO SST 
252 
(Supplementary Fig. 10a, b). While for ENSO rainfall, the eastward-shifted structural 
253 
response plays a more important role in the ENSO rainfall response compared with the 
254 
increased amplitude response (Supplementary Fig. 10c, d). 
255 
A comparison between the ToE of ENSO SST and rainfall change signals in the 
256 
EEP reveals that the modelled ToE of ENSO rainfall signal is generally sooner than that 
257 
of ENSO SST signal by several decades (Fig. 5), which is opposite to the ToE of annual-
258 
mean SST and rainfall change signals. In the MEM, the ENSO SST signal is expected 
259 
 
 
13 
to emerge under both the SSP585 and SSP370 scenarios in the 30-year time windows 
260 
ending at 2070 and 2073, respectively, but not under the other two lower scenarios 
261 
(SSP126 and SSP245) (Fig. 5a), indicative of some sensitivity to emission scenarios; 
262 
the ToE of ENSO rainfall, however, is projected to be in this century under all the 
263 
SSP126, SSP245, SSP370 and SSP585 scenarios in the 30-year time windows ending 
264 
at 2039, 2045, 2042 and 2037, respectively, separated by less than a decade (Fig. 5b), 
265 
around 30 years earlier than ENSO SST. 
266 
Under the SSP585 scenario, the estimated ToE of ENSO rainfall is also sooner 
267 
than that of ENSO SST for most individual models (Fig. 5c, d; Supplementary Fig. 11). 
268 
For ENSO SST, 17 out of 23 (around 74%) models show a ToE before the end of the 
269 
21st century (Fig. 5c), while for ENSO rainfall, all but one model (INM-CM5-0) show 
270 
the ToE (Fig. 5d). A large inter-model spread exists in the ToE of both ENSO SST and 
271 
rainfall, with the inter-model standard deviation up to 50 years (Fig. 5c, d), which, 
272 
however, does not change our result of a sooner ToE of ENSO rainfall than ENSO SST. 
273 
Thus, the signal of ENSO-related variability change, when measured by rainfall6,18, is 
274 
stronger and will emerge sooner as compared to that measured by SST. 
275 
Implications for Emergence of Rainfall Signals 
276 
Our estimations for ToE of annual-mean rainfall in the EEP based on MEM reveal 
277 
that they are dependent on the future emission scenarios, with signals emerging as early 
278 
as before 2040 under the SSP585 scenario; by contrast, annual-mean rainfall is 
279 
undetectable by the end of this century under the lowest SSP126 scenario (Fig. 3a). This 
280 
implies that climate mitigation could be effective in preventing significant rainfall shifts 
281 
in the mean state. However, the estimated MEM ToE of ENSO rainfall are only a few 
282 
years apart in the different emission scenarios (Fig. 5b). Hence, we would expect to 
283 
 
 
14 
detect a significant signal of ENSO rainfall change before 2050 even if we follow a 
284 
strong mitigation pathway such as the SSP126 or SSP245 scenarios. Considering that 
285 
ENSO rainfall is the main driver of global ENSO teleconnections, via heating of the 
286 
atmosphere and the propagation of atmospheric waves to both the tropics and 
287 
extratropics38,39, the emergent ENSO rainfall change signal could trigger wide-ranging 
288 
impacts on natural and human systems. 
289 
Summary and Caveats 
290 
Our results that the annual-mean SST signal emerges sooner than the annual-mean 
291 
rainfall, whereas the ENSO-related rainfall variability signal emerges sooner than the 
292 
ENSO-related SST variability are robust in most individual models as well as in their 
293 
aggregation. We note that the estimated ToE could be affected by persistent model 
294 
biases. For example, the difference between the observed multidecadal enhancement 
295 
and a modelled long-term weakening in the equatorial Pacific west-minus-east SST 
296 
gradient affects the ToE of annual-mean rainfall. However, as we have shown, a pattern 
297 
with a weakened west-minus-east SST gradient should not be excluded in the future 
298 
real world. Another uncertainty source is a large inter-model difference in the exact ToE, 
299 
owing to differences either in background noise, climate change signals influenced by 
300 
the chaotic nature of the climate system16,40, or both. 
301 
Despite these caveats, our result of a sooner ToE of annual-mean SST than annual 
302 
mean rainfall suggests that focus should be placed on the tropical mean SST for 
303 
detection of mean state change in the tropical Pacific. In addition, our result of a ToE 
304 
of ENSO rainfall by around 2040, ~30 years sooner than ENSO SST and insensitive to 
305 
different emission scenarios, highlights the potential risks of extreme events associated 
306 
with ENSO rainfall change and the associated ENSO teleconnections.

Methods 
315 
CMIP6 models, observed datasets, and processing. We use the historical runs for the 
316 
period 1870–2014, the four tier-one SSP (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370 and SSP585) 
317 
scenario runs for the period 2015–2099, and the pre-industrial control (piControl) run 
318 
for the last 500 years from 23 CMIP6 models24. They are ACCESS-CM2, ACCESS-
319

NorESM2-MM. Note that we have only 499 years in model CESM2-WACCM and 300 
324 
years in model CNRM-CM6-1-HR in piControl run. For each model, we use only one 
325 
ensemble member run (r1i1p1f1). Monthly outputs are used of surface temperature (ts, 
326 
which is SST for open ocean), rainfall (pr), surface air specific humidity (huss), and 
327 
vertical pressure velocity (wap) at 500hPa. All the model outputs are bilinear 
328 
interpolated into a 2.5° × 2.5° grid before analyses. 
329 
To investigate ToE of observed SSTs, we use three different observational SST datasets: 
330 
the Hadley Center Sea Ice and SST version 1.1 (HadISSTv1) (ref. 41), the National 
331 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Extended Reconstructed SST version 5 
332 
(ERSSTv5) (ref. 42), and the Centennial In Situ Observation-Based Estimates of the 
333 
Variability of SST and Marine Meteorological Variables version 2 (COBEv2) (ref. 43) 
334 
for the period 1870–2019. 
335 
We set the first 30-year of chosen time period 1870–1899 as the reference period. All 
336 
changes under global warming are calculated by removing the associated values in the 
337 
reference period. Annual-mean values are calculated simply by averaging the monthly 
338 
 
 
17 
values from January and December. Interannual anomaly fields are obtained by 
339 
quadratic de-trending the monthly values during the chosen period and then removing 
340 
the climatological annual cycle. 
341 
Signal, noise, and ToE of annual-mean SST and rainfall. To estimate the signal of 
342 
modelled annual-mean SST, we calculate the response of annual-mean SST to global 
343 
warming. The global warming signal is taken as the annual-mean SST change from the 
344 
reference period of 1870–1899 averaged over the 60°S–60°N domain and then 
345 
smoothed by fitting a fourth order polynomial28 (Supplementary Fig. 3b), written as 
346 
, 
. Here we choose the average of SST from 60°S to 60°N to 
347 
remove inconsistencies caused by sea ice in observational SSTs but not in modelled 
348 
surface temperature (ts). Our conclusions do not change if a different domain, say, 
349 
90°S–90°N, is chosen to compute the global warming signal. The signal of grid-point 
350 
annual-mean SST, 
, is obtained by regressing grid-point annual-mean 
351 
SST change onto the global warming time series 
: 
352 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
(1) 
353 
where 
 is the regression coefficient, representing the response of annual-mean SST 
354 
to global warming, and 
 is the intercept. 
355 
The noise of grid-point annual-mean SST, 
, is defined as the interannual 
356 
standard deviation of annual-mean SST, which is based on the last 500 years of 
357 
piControl run. In observations, calculation for the signal of grid-point annual-mean SST 
358 
is the same as those in models except that it is based on the period 1870–2019, while 
359 
the noise of observational annual-mean SST is obtained by calculating standard 
360 
deviation of the annual-mean SST after the signal removed. Modelled signal

(
) and noise (
) of annual-mean rainfall are similarly 
362 
calculated. 
363 
The ToE of grid-point annual-mean SST is defined as the first year when the grid-point 
364 
signal-to-noise ratio of annual-mean SST, 
, is higher (lower) than 1.0 
365 
(−1.0) if the local response of annual-mean SST to global warming (
) is positive 
366 
(negative), as in a previous study28. Calculation for the ToE of annual-mean rainfall is 
367 
similar to that for annual-mean SST. Note that the chosen threshold value of 
368 
 for a detectable annual-mean signal is somewhat subjective. If a 
369 
larger threshold, say 2.0 (−2.0), is chosen28, the estimated times of emergence of annual-
370 
mean SST and rainfall would be later by around 20–30 years (not shown), but our result 
371 
of a sooner ToE of annual-mean SST compared with that of annual-mean rainfall does 
372 
not change. 
373 
Decomposition of annual-mean SST and rainfall change. The annual-mean SST 
374 
change from the reference period in each grid point can be decomposed into a tropical-
375 
mean SST (
) change averaged over 20°S to 20°N and relative SST (
) that is the 
376 
deviation from the tropical-mean SST. The annual-mean rainfall change can be 
377 
decomposed, from a water vapor budget, into the changes in thermodynamic and 
378 
dynamic component32,33: 
379

where 
 denotes the change relative to the value in the reference period; the overbar 
381

 is surface 
382 
specific humidity and 
 is vertical pressure velocity at 500hPa. The term

386 
Signal, noise, and ToE of ENSO SST and rainfall. Empirical orthogonal function 
387 
(EOF) analysis is used to extract the spatial pattern of ENSO SST in each model and 
388 
observation in the tropical Pacific (20°S–20°N, 120°E–80°W). For each model, the 
389 
EOF analysis is performed on interannual anomalies of each 30-year time window 
390 
moving forward by one year starting from 1870 to 2099, generating an evolution of 30-
391 
year running variability for time from 1899 to 2099 (recorded as the ending year of each 
392 
30-year time window), 
, 
, and evolution of change of 
393 
ENSO 
SST 
from 
the 
reference 
period 
over 
1870–1899, 
394 
. The EOF outputs are arranged such that 
395 
the principal components (PCs) are standardized, and the patterns of EOF modes 
396 
describe variability of the modes. The absolute values of the EOF patterns are taken to 
397 
ensure they are positive. The first EOF mode in each period defines the ENSO SST, and 
398 
the ENSO rainfall is defined by regressing grid-point interannual anomalies of rainfall 
399 
onto the first PC of ENSO SST. 
400 
The evolution of the corresponding global warming signal is taken as the 30-year 
401 
climatological SST change from the reference period, smoothed by fitting a fourth order 
402 
polynomial, written as 
, corresponding to changes in ENSO SST, 
403 
, in each 30-year time window ending from 1899 to 2099.

where 
 is the regression coefficient, representing the response of ENSO SST to

410 
The same EOF analysis is applied to each 30-year time window moving forward by one 
411 
year for the last 500 years of the piControl run to diagnose noise. The application of 
412 
EOF generates 471 realizations of 30-year running grid-point ENSO SST and their 
413 
changes from the reference period of 1870-1899, written as 
, where 
414 
 represents each of the 471 30-year time windows in the piControl run. Calculations 
415 
for the modelled signal of ENSO rainfall (
) and the 471 realizations of 
416 
ENSO rainfall changes in the piControl run from the reference period 
417 
(
) are similar to those for ENSO SST. 
418 
The ToE of ENSO SST is defined as the first 30-year time window when the signal, 
419 
, is higher (lower) than the 99% (1%) value of the noise, 
420 
, for grid-point ENSO SST responses to global warming (  in Eq. 3) 
421 
that are positive (negative). 
422 
For observations, calculation of the signal of ENSO SST is the same as for models 
423 
except that it is based on the period 1870–2019. But when calculating the noise, we 
424 
first remove the least squares quadratic trend of the monthly SST value for the whole 
425 
period 1870–2019, and the remaining is treated as the unforced data, which is analogous 
426 
to the output in piControl run in models. Then the changes in ENSO SST in each 30-
427 
year time window moving forward by one year from the remaining unforced data

relative to the reference period of 1870–1899 are calculated to represent the noise. In 
429 
an 1870–2019 period, we can obtain 121 samples of such change, which are analogous 
430 
to the 471 samples of 
 in models. The ToE of observational ENSO 
431 
SST is estimated by making a comparison between the signal of ENSO SST and the 
432 
above 121 samples of ENSO SST change in a similar statistical way as in models. 
433 
To illustrate, we use one model (EC-Earth3-Veg) and one observational SST 
434 
(HadISSTv1) and specify a grid-point (0°, 120°W) to give a brief description of how to 
435 
estimate the ToE of ENSO SST (Supplementary Fig. 12). Both the EC-Earth3-Veg and 
436 
HadISSTv1 display increased signal of ENSO SST with time for the specified grid-
437 
point (Supplementary Fig. 12a), indicating a positive ENSO SST response to global 
438 
warming. As such, we choose the 
 value that is higher than the 99-
439 
percentile value of all the variability samples (471 samples for EC-Earth3-Veg and 121 
440 
samples for HadISSTv1) as the threshold value for a detectable 
. The 
441 
threshold value for EC-Earth3-Veg is 0.22 (horizontal black dashed line in 
442 
Supplementary Fig. 12a, b), while that for HadISSTv1 is 0.27 (horizontal red dashed 
443 
line in Supplementary Fig. 12a, b). The ToE of ENSO SST in the specified grid-point 
444 
is thus defined as the first 30-year when the 
 exceeds the threshold 
445 
value. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 12a, the ToE of ENSO SST in the specified 
446 
grid-point for EC-Earth3-Veg is the 30-year time window ending at year 2021, while 
447 
that for HadISSTv1 does not appear, given that the associated signal does not exceed 
448 
the corresponding threshold value even in the last 30-year time window (1990–2019). 
449 
Calculation for the modelled ToE of ENSO rainfall is similar to that for ENSO SST.

choosing different threshold values, but the main conclusions, such as a sooner ToE of 
452 
ENSO rainfall than that of ENSO SST and both the ToE of ENSO SST and rainfall are 
453 
not yet detectable, do not change when other threshold values, for example, the 95% 
454 
(5%) or 97.5% (2.5%), are chosen (Supplementary Table. 1). 
455 
Separation of amplitude and structural changes in ENSO SST and rainfall. The 
456 
changes in ENSO SST in each 30-year time window from 1870 to 2099 relative to the 
457 
reference period of 1870–1899, 
, are subjected to a “pattern” 
458 
regression onto ENSO SST pattern in the reference period, 
. The linear 
459 
regression defines the amplitude change in ENSO SST, 
: 
460

461 
where 
 is the “pattern” regression coefficient and 
 is the intercept. And the 
462 
residual part represents the structural change in ENSO SST, written as 
463 
: 
464 
 
 
 
(5). 
465 
A separation of ENSO rainfall change is carried out similarly to that of ENSO SST 
466 
change.

Fig. 1 | MEM response and time of emergence (ToE) of annual-mean SST and 
593 
rainfall. Shown are based on models under historical forcing and the SSP585 emission 
594 
scenario. a, Response of annual-mean SST to global warming (see “Signal and noise of 
595 
annual-mean SST and rainfall” in Methods); b, ToE of annual-mean SST signal; c and 
596 
d, The same as a and b but for annual-mean rainfall. Contours in a and c denote the 
597 
MEM noise of SST (units: K, with an interval of 0.1 K) and rainfall (units: mm day−1, 
598 
with an interval of 0.3 mm day−1), respectively. Stippling in c denotes that more than 
599 
70% of models have the same sign. The shaded regions in b and d denote that more 
600 
than 70% of models have emergent signals by the year 2099 and are plotted by 
601 
averaging all the models that show the local ToE by 2099. Purple curves in c and d 
602 
denote the 7 mm day−1 contour of rainfall climatology in the reference period. The green 
603 
box in each plot denotes the eastern equatorial Pacific (2.5°S–2.5°N, 180°W–100°W) 
604 
region. The MEM increasing signal of annual-mean SST has been detected across the 
605 
whole tropical Pacific, with the latest ToE in the EEP, while that of annual-mean rainfall, 
606 
which mostly appears in the equatorial Pacific, has yet been detected.

Fig. 2 | ToE of annual-mean SST in the eastern equatorial Pacific. a, Signal-to-
609 
noise ratio of annual-mean SST in the MEM under historical and four future SSP 
610 
scenarios and in three observations. The gray shadings denote one inter-model standard 
611 
deviation, with darker color indicating a higher emission scenario. The vertical solid 
612 
lines denote the year when the signal-to-noise ratio exceeds 1.0 in different SSP 
613 
scenarios; b and c, ToE (b), and noise (c) of annual-mean SST. The horizontal dashed 
614 
lines in b denotes year 2020; d, Responses (from top to bottom) of relative SST (
), 
615 
tropical-mean SST (
) and annual-mean SST to global warming (units: K K−1); e and 
616 
f, The same as b, but for 
 (e), and 
 (f). Missing bars in b and f denote the times 
617 
of emergence for these models (observations) do not appear during 1870–2099 (1870–
618 
2019), and the MEM results in b and f are based on non-missing values. The orange 
619 
error bars denote one inter-model standard deviation. The modelled shown in b and d–

f are based on historical forcing and the SSP585 emission scenario. The detectable 
621 
signal of annual-mean SST in the EEP mainly reflects the detectable signal of tropical-
622 
mean SST, and the model-observation discrepancy in the ToE of annual-mean SST is 
623 
caused by the different responses between an observed enhancement and a modelled 
624 
weakening in the west-minus-east SST gradient.

Fig. 3 | ToE of annual-mean rainfall in the eastern equatorial Pacific. a, Signal-to-
627 
noise ratio of annual-mean rainfall in the MEM under historical and four future SSP 
628 
scenarios. The shadings denote one inter-model standard deviation, with darker color 
629 
indicating a higher emission scenario. The vertical solid lines denote the year when the 
630 
signal-to-noise ratio exceeds 1.0 in different SSP scenarios; b and c, ToE of annual-
631 
mean rainfall (b) and reconstructed annual-mean rainfall (c) (see “Decomposition of 
632 
annual-mean SST and rainfall change” in Methods). The orange error bars denote one 
633 
inter-model standard deviation; d and e, Inter-model scatterplots between the ToE for 
634 
annual-mean rainfall and that for dynamic component (d), and thermodynamic 
635 
component (e) of annual-mean rainfall. The solid line in e denotes the inter-model linear 
636 
regression. Missing bars in c and markers in e denote the times of emergence for these 
637 
models do not appear during 1870–2099, and the MEM result is based on non-missing 
638 
 
 
30 
values. Shown in b–e is based on models under historical forcing and the SSP585 
639 
emission scenario. The later ToE of annual-mean rainfall than that of annual-mean SST, 
640 
which appears in around mid-century based on the MEM, is sensitive to emission 
641 
scenario and is determined by the ToE of its dynamic component.

644 
of ENSO SST (a) and rainfall (b) in the reference period (see “ENSO-related SST and 
645 
rainfall variability” in Methods); c and d, Responses of ENSO SST (c) and rainfall (d) 
646 
to global warming, which are calculated by regressing the signal of ENSO SST and 
647 
rainfall onto global warming time series of 
, respectively. Stippling denotes 
648 
where more than 70% of models have the same sign; e and f, ToE of ENSO SST (e) and 
649 
rainfall (f). The shaded regions denote that more than 70% of models have emergent 
650 
signals, and are plotted by averaging all the models that show the local ToE. Shown in 
651 
c–f is based on models under historical forcing and the SSP585 emission scenario. 
652 
Increasing signals of ENSO SST and rainfall with time, both of which involve not only 
653 
amplitude change but also pattern shifts, have yet been detected.

Fig. 5 | ToE of ENSO SST and rainfall in the eastern equatorial Pacific. a, Signal 
656 
of ENSO SST in the MEM under historical and four future SSP scenario runs and in 
657 
three observations. The shading denotes one inter-model standard deviation, with 
658 
darker color indicating a higher emission scenario. The horizontal black dashed line 
659 
(0.24) denotes the MEM threshold value for estimating the MEM detectable signal of 
660 
ENSO SST, while the horizontal colored dashed lines (red is 0.21, green is 0.12 and 
661 
blue is 0.16) are similar to the black line, but for three observations (see “ToE of ENSO 
662 
SST and rainfall” in Methods). The vertical solid lines denote the ending year of a 30-
663 
year time window when the MEM signal of ENSO SST exceeds the defined threshold 
664 
value; b, The same as a, but for ENSO rainfall only in the MEM. The MEM threshold 
665 
value for estimating the MEM detectable signal of ENSO rainfall is 0.32 (horizontal 
666 
dashed line in b); c, ToE of ENSO SST under historical forcing and the SSP585 
667 
emission scenario; missing bars denote the times of emergence do not appear before 
668 
2099 (2019) for these models (observations). The orange error bars denote one inter-
669 
 
 
33 
model standard deviation; d, The same as c, but for ENSO rainfall. The modelled ToE 
670 
of ENSO rainfall is projected to emerge by around 2040±3 based on the MEM 
671 
regardless of emission scenarios, around 30 years sooner than that of ENSO SST, which 
672 
is with some sensitivity to emission scenarios.
