Abstract
To better understand drought and flood dynamics in the Pantanal is crucial an adequate hydrometeorological monitoring
network. However, few studies have investigated whether the current monitoring systems are suitable in this region.
Here, we analyzed the hydrometeorological monitoring network of the Aquidauana region, composed of pluviometric,
meteorological and fluviatile gauging stations. We obtained data of all hydrometeorological gauges available in this re-
gion to compare with the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) recommendation. We found that although the
number of stations in operation is satisfactory when compared with that established by the WMO, the network is not sat-
isfactory in the operating stations because of lack of maintenance, thus creating a need for additional stations. This fact
was also observed when analyzing the meteorological network. Using remote sensing data may be possible to fill these
data gap. However, to improve the knowledge on hydrological processes in this region is still necessary to install addi-
tional ground-based stations.

Análise e Distribuição da Rede de Monitoramento de Chuvas
na Região do Pantanal Brasileiro
Resumo
Para entender melhor a dinâmica de seca e inundação no Pantanal é fundamental uma rede de monitoramento
hidrometeorológico adequada. No entanto, poucos estudos têm investigado se os atuais sistemas de monitoramento são
adequados nesta região. Aqui, analisamos a rede de monitoramento hidrometeorológico da região de Aquidauana,
composta por estações pluviométricas, meteorológicas e fluviais. Obtivemos dados de todos os medidores hidro-
meteorológicos disponíveis nesta região para comparação conforme a recomendação da Organização Meteorológica
Mundial (OMM). Constatou-se que, embora o número de estações em operação seja satisfatório quando comparado com
o estabelecido pela OMM, a densidade da rede não é satisfatória nas estações de operação por falta de manutenção,
criando assim a necessidade de estações adicionais. Esse fato também foi observado na análise da rede meteorológica. O
uso de dados de sensoriamento remoto pode ser possível para preencher essa lacuna de dados. No entanto, para melhorar
o conhecimento sobre os processos hidrológicos nesta região ainda é necessário instalar estações terrestres adicionais.

1. Introduction
The water crisis throughout the world, and particu-
larly in Brazil, has brought up discussions regarding the
conscious use of natural resources. Other existing water re-
serves in the country are being considered, as Brazil has
some of the largest rivers in the world and houses much of
the Guarani Aquifer System – one of the largest under-
ground reserves of fresh water that could possibly be one of
the solutions for a good part of the country’s water supply
(Oliveira et al., 2016).
Proper management of potential water reserves avail-
able in the world requires knowledge of the fluviatile and
pluviometric systems. This monitoring becomes a key ac-
tivity to subsidize the management of water resources. On
the other hand, the historical data series resulting from such
activity allow monitoring weather and climate over the
years, supporting projects of research on water resources.
Thus, the gathering of information necessary for hy-
drology is accomplished through hydrometeorological sta-
tion networks, whose importance of data series is propor-
tional to their temporal extent. In Brazil, many stations
have recorded data for more than a hundred years, such as
the pluviometric station of Morro Velho (Minas Gerais
State) and the fluviatile gauging station of the River Negro
in Manaus, with data recorded from 1855 and 1902, respec-
tively. The first activities of hydrological data collection
performed in an organized manner, however, date back to
the early 20th century, more precisely, 1920, when the Com-
mission of Hydraulic Forces Studies built stations ad-
dressed to specific studies of hydraulic use, aiming at hy-
droelectric power. The register of hydrometric stations in
the country started around 1968 by the former DNAEE
(National Department of Water and Power) with publica-
tions of the first inventory of fluviatile and pluviometric
stations (Ishihara, 2014).
According to the ANA (National Water Agency), the
National Basic Hydro-meteorological Network has 2,527
pluviometric stations that measure rainfall at a given point.
By means of an ambitious project, ANA is planning the na-
tional hydro-meteorological network from those in opera-
tion and in partnership with the various agencies and
interested states (Ana, 2015). In 1997 the PCBAP (Conser-
vation Plan of the Upper Paraguay Basin) in 1997 started a
study on the pluviometric stations: they totaled 214 sta-
tions, 22 of which deactivated. Therefore, at the time of the
survey 192 stations were operating in the region (Tucci,
2012).
The area investigated in the present study is inserted
within the BAP – Upper Paraguay Basin – (which is the flu-
vial channel of the River Aquidauana). The Aquidauana ba-
sin has a significant importance for the sub-basin of the
River Miranda, a tributary of the River Paraguay in the
State of Mato Grosso do Sul. Located by the homonymous
river, the city of Aquidauana began its process of urban de-
velopment along its banks. The urban territorial expansion
led to significant changes in the natural landscape, showing
many current social and environmental problems; flood is a
case in point. The frequent occurrence of either flood or
drought results in severe losses of livestock and crops. The
inundation interrupts land transportation, and the dry
weather accelerates the river erosion because of the heavy
uncontrolled river traffic (Willink et al., 2009).
It is therefore extremely important to find a suitable
method of flood forecasting to help plan a sustainable so-
cioeconomic management system for local development.
However, it is necessary to analyze the conditions of the
meteorological data provided by the pluviometric and
fluviatile networks in operation so that a suitable methodol-
ogy for forecasting weather events can be developed. De-
spite to the importance of this evaluation, few studies have
investigated whether the current monitoring systems are
suitable in this region
The objectives of this study are to analyze the rain
gauges network distribution in the region of Aquidauana
and to check whether the current installed ground-based
stations are sufficient to monitor the region.
2. Area of Study
The Aquidauana basin is bordered by the River Para-
ná basin to the south and east; by the River Negro basin to
the north; and by the River Miranda basin, of which it is a
tributary, to the west (Fig. 1). The basin is divided into two
distinct areas: the northern part, that is drained by the upper
reaches of the River Aquidauana itself, coated with quartz
sands that have high susceptibility to erosion; and the
southern part, drained by the tributaries of the left bank
downstream the Salobra brook, predominated by silt and
clay soils. A large part of this area houses pastures for cattle
and potentially irrigable agricultural areas.

red and the fluviatile ones marked in green.
The River Aquidauana (Fig. 1) has a privileged loca-
tion; its natural resources pose a great potential for tourism
and a good reserve for fisheries. Covering 286 km in the
study area, the River Aquidauana is the main tributary of
the River Miranda and one of BAPs main streams. It starts
in the surroundings of Serra de Maracaju, in the plateaus of
São Gabriel do Oeste county, altitude of 715 m, crossing
plateaus and reaching the city of Aquidauana at an altitude
of 133 m, with its mouth in the River Miranda at 90 m.
3. Methodology
The Hydro System was used in this work as a source
of information on pluviometric and fluviatile stations in the
Aquidauana region, made available online by the ANA via
the HidroWeb System.
The HidroWeb system allows, among other things, a)
managing a hydro-meteorological database stored in a rela-
tional database; b) entering data by agencies that operate a
hydro-meteorological network; c) analyzing the consis-
tency of fluviatile data and its handling; d) generating his-
torical data series of limnimetric quotas; and e) calculating
the basic statistical functions necessary for determining the
periods of maximum ebb-tide and flood. This system car-
ries two types of hydro-meteorological data: inventory data
(rivers and stations), and historical data series (daily mea-
surements of quotas and rain). The data are grouped into ba-
sic processing units called records (Ana, 2015).
To analyze data generated by rainfall and river flow
networks of the Aquidauana region, we used spreadsheets
with data from the operation period of each station. The
spreadsheets were subdivided interspersing the operating
periods of the stations, given the long data series of some
stations. It was possible to adopt a classification criterion of
annual records for complete or incomplete information be-
cause of yearly data for most series of records.
3.1. Distribution and density of pluviometric stations
To analyze the distribution and density of pluviomet-
ric stations in the basin, we used the methodology recom-
mended
by
the
World
Meteorological
Organization
(WMO), according to the following criteria: (a) interna-
tional experience; (b) the main objectives of the desired ac-
curacy, and (c) the dominant meteorological characteristics
in the region (Wmo, 1994).
By systematizing in tables the information made a-
vailable by the stations we have tried to establish a profile
of spatial and sectorial distribution of the rainfall network
in the region. The criterion is based on groups defined by
the WMO considering population density. It is based on the
international experience of a large number of countries and
covers a broad spectrum of different demographic, geo-
graphic, morphological and climate conditions. Such net-
work is not ideal but the method suggests a lower limit for a
network with reasonable density. A rainfall network with
reasonable density should be within the confidence groups.
Fig. 2 shows a graph of relative population density plotted
against the density of the pluviometric stations in operation.

With regards to the codes of responsible agencies and
operators, Table 1 lists the codes and the respective agen-
cies used in this study.
3.2. Inventory of pluviometric stations
It is important to know the number of pluviometric
stations, their operation and proper maintenance to subsi-
dize studies related to the maximum use of water resources
in various aspects. In the BAP, the main interests are the is-
sues of navigation, flood warnings, hydroelectric plants,
water supply and its role in biodiversity conservation, and
also the preservation of scenic value. In addition to these
concerns, in the Aquidauana region there has to be consid-
ered the riverside population, which have been affected by
the floods.
Table 2 shows the information of the rain gauges in
the Aquidauana sub-basin.
The stations providing rainfall indices that influence
the level of the River Aquidauana quota in Aquidauana city
are: Palmeiras, Santa Elisa, Rochedo and Bandeirantes.
The other stations are located either upwards the city or on
rivers that flow into the River Miranda or Taboco
The WMO used a criterion that assesses the number
of stations per km2 considering population density. The
analysis of the rainfall monitoring network was conducted
in order to provide the Aquidauana region with a suffi-
ciently dense network that would make it possible to accu-
rately characterize the rainfall system in a uniform and
systematic manner. Two criteria were taken into account:
population density and minimum density for pluviometric
stations.
i) Population density
Following the international experience, a reasonable den-
sity network should be located within the confidence
groups defined by the WMO (see Fig. 3). Thus, the
density of stations (number of stations per 1,000 km2)
and the population density (number of inhabitants per
km2) were calculated for the region. The calculated

values for density of the stations were then compared
with those recommended by the method to check the
minimum density of the network.
ii) Minimum density for pluviometric stations
The density of stations (area of km2 by number of stations)
was calculated for the region and compared with the
minimum recommended by the Wmo (1994) (Ta-
ble 3).
4. Results and Discussion
The hydrographic region of Mato Grosso do Sul oc-
cupies an area of 173,874.68 km2, corresponding to 48% of
the BAP. The Upper Paraguay Basin comprises an area cor-
responding to half of the state. In the surrounding highlands
(above altitude of 200 m) lie the sources of the main rivers
that make up the great plain, an area below altitude of
200 m, with low drainage capacity, hence subject to major
flooding (Ishihara, 2014).
The studied area is located on the Miranda basin, that
belongs to the BAP, specifically the upper sub-basin of the
River Aquidauana, with an area of 21,983.00 km2 and a
population of 46,998 inhabitants in 2014 (Ibge, 2015). The
population density is 2.69 in habitants/km2. To calculate
the number of stations per km2, the nine operating stations
in the area were considered, excluding the deactivated sta-
tions and those with missing data. Table 4 shows the results
of this analysis.
It is worth noting that the basin comprising the River
Aquidauana has a population density of 2.69 in habi-
tants/km2 (Table 4). A rainfall network with reasonable
density must have two stations per 1,000 km2 for this range
of population density (Fig. 3).
When plotting the data for the Aquidauana region in
Fig. 3, we noted that the region is below of the recom-
mended limit by the WMO. It is located between the lines
demarcating the relative densities of 10% and 50%, and is
not included in the limit considered reasonable. We found
the same for the BAP. A similar finding was reported by
Loureiro et al. (2012) in their study on the Cerrado biome.
Thus, the Aquidauana region is still below the number of
stations per 1000 km2 established by the WMO. The region
under study needs a monitoring network - one station every
1000 km2 - to measure the intensity of precipitation with

quality. This problem does not apply in this region of study
alone, but in several places around the world where the
number of works that perform the monitoring of hydro me-
teorological data is decreasing (Burt and McDonnell,
2014). The use of these data for research is of great socio-
economic importance for the region, since it allows the
planning not only of livestock, the main economic activity
of the studied basin, but also of fishing, tourism and naviga-
tion.
Kidd et al. (2016) show that the area with operational
rain gauges worldwide is surprisingly small, totaling only
0.00000000593% of the Earth’s surface. There is a high
number of rain gauges, but the actual number available to
the user is considerably variable depending on the study pe-
riod and latency requirements. Information that uses rain-
fall measurements with various input data from amateur
networks has potential for many applications, including
meteorology, but is probably more difficult to achieve due
to timely data access, continuity, and absolute calibration
of measurements.
Researchers are striving to obtain measurement data
in regions with limited data, however, additional high-
quality measures are still required to fill gaps in certain re-
gions. In particular, the interior of some continents such as
South America, Africa and Oceania, and continental land
regions in the Northern Hemisphere and Antarctica are de-
ficient in precipitation meters (Muller et al., 2015). Projects
such as the Trans-African Hydro-Meteorological Observa-
tory (Tahmo, http://tahmo.org) are now beginning to meet
this need.
To address the lack of data in regions outside the
WMO recommended range, there are satellite observations
where rainfall indices obtained from remote sensing have
been available across the globe for more than 20 years.
More specifically, satellite estimates are distinctly advanta-
geous in assessing rainfall in regions with few data, such as
oceans. Satellite observations of visible, infrared, and spe-
cially passive and active, microwave system are used to
generate precipitation estimates using a number of tech-
niques (Kidd et al., 2016). Several authors use remote sens-
ing data to fill the lack of data and a monitoring network at
some points in the study region (Hughes, 2006), (Dembélé
and Zwart, 2016) and (Bodian et al., 2016).
Doing research and maintaining monitoring networks
are expensive and require a lot of work. Thus, several re-
searchers have failed to develop field studies and have in-
vested more in modeling studies and used remote sensing
data where only one computer is necessary. This is also due
to the need for fast publication (Burt and Mcdonnell, 2014);
(Vidon, 2015). Modeling and remote sensing play impor-
tant roles in this area of research, but they do not replace ob-
served data, that are necessary to validate both.
5. Conclusion
In this study we evaluated the hydrometeorological
monitoring network of the Aquidauana region and whether
the current installed ground-based stations are sufficient to
monitor the region. Our results indicate that there is a need
for installation of more ground-based stations in this re-
gion; however, no additional stations would not be neces-
sary if a systematic reactivation existed of the disable
ground-based stations.
When compared with the BAP, the Aquidauana re-
gion has a better distribution of stations. Thus, an up-to-
date data collection of the whole area of the Upper Para-
guay Basin should be performed in order to check the con-
centration of stations. A lack of integration was seen
between the agencies in charge in relation to concentration
of information and proximity of stations.
Using remote sensing data may be possible to fill the
hydrometeorological data gap. However, we conclude that
to improve the knowledge on hydrological processes in this
region is still necessary to install new ground-based data,
mainly because remote sensing data and hydrologic model-
ing need of ground-based data to be evaluated.
