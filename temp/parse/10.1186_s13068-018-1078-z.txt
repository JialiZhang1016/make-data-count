Abstract 
Background:  As a versatile platform chemical, construction of microbial catalysts for free octanoic acid production 
from biorenewable feedstocks is a promising alternative to existing petroleum-based methods. However, the bio-
production strategy has been restricted by the low capacity of E. coli inherent fatty acid biosynthesis. In this study, 
a combination of integrated computational and experimental approach was performed to manipulate the E. coli exist-
ing metabolic network, with the objective of improving bio-octanoic acid production.
Results:  First, a customized OptForce methodology was run to predict a set of four genetic interventions required 
for production of octanoic acid at 90% of the theoretical yield. Subsequently, all the ten candidate proteins associated 
with the predicted interventions were regulated individually, as well as in contrast to the combination of interventions 
as suggested by the OptForce strategy. Among these enzymes, increased production of 3-hydroxy-acyl-ACP dehy-
dratase (FabZ) resulted in the highest increase (+ 45%) in octanoic acid titer. But importantly, the combinatorial appli-
cation of FabZ with the other interventions as suggested by OptForce further improved octanoic acid production, 
resulting in a high octanoic acid-producing E. coli strain +fabZ ΔfadE ΔfumAC ΔackA (TE10) (+ 61%). Optimization of 
TE10 expression, medium pH, and C:N ratio resulted in the identified strain producing 500 mg/L of C8 and 805 mg/L 
of total FAs, an 82 and 155% increase relative to wild-type MG1655 (TE10) in shake flasks. The best engineered strain 
produced with high selectivity (> 70%) and extracellularly (> 90%) up to 1 g/L free octanoic acid in minimal medium 
fed-batch culture.
Conclusions:  This work demonstrates the effectiveness of integration of computational strain design and experi-
mental characterization as a starting point in rewiring metabolism for octanoic acid production. This result in con-
junction with the results of other studies using OptForce in strain design demonstrates that this strategy may be also 
applicable to engineering E. coli for other customized bioproducts.

Background
The use of microbial biocatalysts for biorenewables 
production is a promising alternative [1, 2] to the non-
renewable oil-based option. Among these biorenewa-
bles, fatty acids have received significant attention due 
to their wide range of applications [3–5]. Fatty acids are 
directly used a food preservative [4, 5]. They also serve as 
precursor for synthesis of biocompatible polymers (e.g., 
polyanhydrides) with low toxicity [6]. In addition to such 
direct uses, fatty acids can also be described as a chemi-
cal intermediate that can be catalytically upgraded to a 
broad range of chemicals and fuels [7–9]. For instance, 
fatty acids can be decarboxylated to alkanes as diesel 
fuel [8, 10], or deoxygenated to alpha-olefins for ethyl-
ene polymerization [11, 12]. Furthermore, fatty acids can 
be converted to fatty acid methyl or ethyl esters (FAME/
FAEE), which have higher energy density and lower water 
solubility than the first-generation biofuel ethanol [13].
Among microbial production organisms, Escherichia 
coli is widely recognized as an excellent host strain for 
production of biorenewable chemicals or fuels due to its 
fast growth, sequenced genome, and genetic tractabil-
ity [12]. A variety of reports have described the meta-
bolic engineering of E. coli for production of free fatty 
acids with high titer and yield [14–19] (Table 1). Accord-
ing to the chain length, fatty acids can be classified as 
short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), with 6–10 carbons, or 
medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA), with 12–18 carbons 
[12]. Octanoic acid (C8) is a representative SCFA and has 
advantages over MCFA, as octanoic acid methyl or ethyl 
esters have lower freezing points and kinematic viscosi-
ties in contrast to saturated MCFAMEs or MCFAEEs, 
and thus can enhance fuel quality and have wider appli-
cations [20].
Although many efforts have been successful in improv-
ing microbial production of MCFA [8, 12, 13, 21–23], 
production of short-chain C8 is not as advanced. 
Recently, S. cerevisiae and mixed microbial communities 
have been engineered to produce octanoate; however, 
the yields were still relatively low (< 320 mg/L) [24–28]. 
Moreover, to our knowledge, the highest titer in minimal 
medium of free C8 using E. coli engineered with its exist-
ing synthesis mechanisms is no more than 250 mg/L [17, 
29, 30] (Table 1), which suggests that the existing meta-
bolic network in E. coli is not optimal for C8 production. 
To this end, engineering of E. coli inherent metabolism 
to release its C8 synthesis capacity is desirable. How-
ever, engineering strategies that are useful for improv-
ing MCFA production might be not simply applied to 
improving SCFA production due to distinct acyl-ACP 
thioesterases and optimal rates of acyl-ACP elongation 
[17, 29]. Although intuitive trial-and-error engineering 
may be ultimately successful, it is also labor intensive. In 
contrast, computational strain design tools, such as Opt-
Force, have shown promise in selecting metabolic targets 
for production of desired targets, due to consideration of 
the complex interconnectivity of cellular metabolism [12, 
31, 32].
OptForce is an optimization procedure to identify all 
genetic manipulations required for overproduction of 
targeted chemicals. It makes use of available flux meas-
urements with a stoichiometric genome-scale model and 
extracts a minimal set of metabolic fluxes which must 
actively be forced through genetic manipulations (i.e., 
FORCE set) to make sure that all fluxes in the metabolic 
network are consistent with the overproduction objective 
[33]. Our prior study employed OptForce for prediction 
of metabolic targets for C8 production [31]. According to 
the OptForce prediction for C8 overproduction, four dis-
tinct interventions (FORCE sets) were suggested (Fig. 1). 
By using a rapid and iterative CRISPR–Cas9 technique 
[34], a variety of C8-producing E. coli strains were con-
structed. Among them, the combinatorial ZEFA (TE10) 
strain exhibits the best performance, resulting in a free 
C8 titer of 1 g/L (90% extracellular) and a high selectivity 
(> 70%) in M9 medium using glucose as the sole carbon 
source. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of 
combinatorial utilization of computational strain design 
and experimental approach for free C8 production.
Results
Metabolic interventions suggested by OptForce 
for octanoic acid production
The type II fatty acid biosynthesis (FAB) pathway is rec-
ognized as the primary route of fatty acid production by 
E. coli [35]. Figure  1 briefly illustrates the anabolic and 
catabolic metabolism of octanoic acid (C8) within E. coli. 
Acetyl-CoA serves as both initiation primer of fatty acid 
synthesis and precursor of malonyl-acyl carrier protein 
(ACP). Specifically, acetyl-CoA is used by acetyl-CoA 
carboxylase (ACC) to produce malonyl-CoA, which is 
subsequently converted to malonyl-ACP by malonyl-
CoA-ACP transacylase (FabD). The initiation of fatty 
acid synthesis starts with condensation of acetyl-CoA 
and malonyl-ACP to form butyryl-ACP, which serves as 
the core for chain elongation. During each round of the 
elongation cycle, a two-carbon unit from malonyl-ACP is 
added to the fatty acyl-ACP chain. Finally, the elongated 
acyl-ACP is hydrolyzed by thioesterase to release free 
fatty acid. For production of free C8, the TE10 thioester-
ase from Anaerococcus tetradius [29], which primarily 
hydrolyzes octanoyl-ACP, was transformed into producer 
strains. Free octanoic acid (or octanoate anion) whose 
carboxyl group was not esterified with glycerol-3-phos-
phate to form lipids is found to be the predominant fatty 
acid (80–90%) produced by strains harboring TE10 gene

Tan et al. Biotechnol Biofuels  (2018) 11:87 
(Fig.  2), which is consistent with previous reports [29]. 
Conversely, free fatty acids can be also degraded by E. 
coli. Fatty acid is firstly acylated by fatty acyl-CoA syn-
thetase (FadD) to form fatty acyl-CoA, which then enters 
into the β-oxidation cycle pathway for degradation. Dur-
ing each turn of the oxidation cycle, a two-carbon unit is 
removed from the acyl-CoA chain to produce one mol-
ecule of acetyl-CoA [35].
The OptForce algorithm was previously used to 
identify a prioritized set of metabolic interventions 
that would rewire the flux topology of native E. coli 
metabolism towards overproduction of octanoic acid [31, 
33] (Fig.  1). The simulations, performed under aerobic 
glucose minimal medium conditions using the iAF1260 
genome-scale metabolic model of E. coli (Additional 
file 1: Table S1) [31], suggested a set of four reaction-level 
manipulations that improve C8 yield to almost 90% of its 
theoretical maximum [31, 33] (Fig. 1). The primary inter-
ventions include (i) up-regulating any of the fatty acid 
chain elongation reactions in the C8-chain, i.e., 3-oxy-
acyl-ACP synthase (3OAS80), 3-oxo-acyl-ACP reduc-
tase (3OAR80), or 3-hydroxy-acyl-ACP dehydratase

(3HAD80) by at least two times of the maximum achiev-
able flux in the wild-type E. coli; (ii) elimination of any 
reactions in the β-oxidation pathway, i.e., acyl-CoA dehy-
drogenase (ACOAD3), enoyl-CoA hydratase (ECOAH3), 
3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HACD3), 3-ketoa-
cyl-CoA thiolase (KAT3). Together, these two interven-
tions account for over 86% of the predicted C8 yield 
increase [31].
Besides being the precursor for fatty acid synthesis, 
acetyl-CoA also has two additional roles. First, acetyl-
CoA and oxaloacetic acid (OAA) can be catalyzed by 
citrate synthase to form citrate as part of the TCA cycle 
[32]. Consequently, OptForce suggests elimination of 
fumarase (FUM) to disrupt the TCA cycle activity and 
maintain a higher pool of acetyl-CoA to be redirected 
towards the fatty acid elongation. In addition, acetyl-CoA 
can also be converted by phosphotransacetylase (PTA) 
and acetate kinase (ACK) to acetate. Therefore, OptForce 
targets elimination of the acetate formation pathway 
(Fig.  1). Overall, the flux redirection strategy suggested 
by OptForce could be summarized as up-regulation of 
the target pathway (i.e., the C8 chain of fatty acid syn-
thesis), followed by elimination of competing paths that 
either degrade the product (i.e., the β-oxidation path-
way) or degrade the precursor (i.e., the TCA and acetate 
synthesis pathway). Note that OptForce predictions are 
based on a stoichiometry-only model of E. coli metabo-
lism, and do not include other significant factors, such as 
enzyme kinetics and transcriptional and substrate-level 
regulation into consideration. Therefore, the interven-
tions and target yields predicted by OptForce should be 
considered as a starting point for rewiring the metabo-
lism, rather than guaranteed hits.
Effects of individual interventions on octanoic acid 
production
As shown in Fig.  1, interventions suggested by Opt-
Force are at the level of metabolic reactions. In order to 
implement these interventions genetically, it is essential 
to translate the “reaction” language into “gene” language 
[32]. Within the annotated genome of E. coli MG1655, we 
identified a total of 10 genes encoding enzymes for these 
reactions (Fig.  1). These 10 genes can be divided into 
four different modules: (i) fatty acids biosynthesis (Fab), 
including fabB, fabF, fabG, and fabZ genes; (ii) fatty acids 
degradation (Fad), including fadE, fadA, and fadB genes;

(iii) FUM, including fumAC genes, and (iv) acetate (Ace), 
including ackA and pta genes.
The first set of prioritized interventions suggested by 
OptForce for production of C8 includes up-regulation of 
one of the chain elongation reactions in the Fab module 
(Fig. 1). To this end, the effect of increased expression of 
individual fab genes on C8 production was investigated. 
Prior research has demonstrated that overexpression of 
pathway genes might cause metabolic burdens, such as 
from plasmid maintenance, leading to a trade-off in pro-
duction [36]. To this end, here we overexpressed the fab 
genes by inserting a second copy of fab gene into genomic 
DNA of E. coli MG1655 at the mgsA site, with regulated 
by a strong constitutive promoter M1-93 [30]. Increasing 
the expression of fabZ, which encodes the 3-hydroxyacyl-
ACP dehydratase, significantly increased C8 production 
(Table  2). Specifically, +fabZ (TE10) strain produced 
398 (26.9 mg/g glucose, yield) and 479 mg/L of free C8 
and total FAs, which exceeded the wild-type MG1655 
(TE10) production of 275 mg/L (19.9 mg/g glucose) free 
C8 and 315  mg/L total FAs by more than 45 and 52%, 
respectively (P < 0.01). Increased expression of the fabG 
gene, encoding the 3-oxo-acyl-ACP reductase, led to no 
significant change in C8 production (P > 0.05) (Table 2). 
Unexpectedly, increased expression of some fab genes 
resulted in decreased C8 production. For instance, 
+fabB (3-oxy-acyl-ACP synthase I) (TE10) or +fabF 
(3-oxy-acyl-ACP synthase II) (TE10) strains each pro-
duced roughly 250 mg/L of (~ 19.0 mg/g glucose) C8 and 
285  mg/L of total FAs, an approximately 10% decrease 
relative to the starting strain MG1655 (TE10) (P < 0.05). 
While this result is in conflict with the OptForce pre-
dictions, which is based only upon stoichiometric con-
siderations, it is consistent with prior observations that 
inhibiting the activity of FabB and FabF contributed to 
increased production of C8, likely through regulatory 
effects [17]. From metabolic control analysis, linear path-
way enzymes may share control for the flux through that 
pathway, and thus genes for all enzymes in the metabolic 
pathway should be overexpressed together for further 
increasing the production of desired targets [37–41]. To 
this end, +fabG and +fabB/F based on +fabZ was per-
formed (+fabZGB/+fabZGF, Additional file  2: Figure 
S1). However, compared with +fabZ, both +fabZGB and 
+fabZGF decreased rather than increased C8 production 
(Table 2).

In this study, the genetic interventions identified by 
OptForce are prioritized based on their impact on C8 
product yield improvement. In addition to the first set, 
the second set of prioritized interventions predicted 
by OptForce is interruption of the β-oxidation cycle. In 
contrast to the first set of Fab module, engineering of the 
corresponding Fad module by deletion of any fadE (acyl-
CoA dehydrogenase), fadA (3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase), or 
fadB (enoyl-CoA hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydro-
genase) led to no significant change in production of C8 
or total FAs (P > 0.05) (Table 2).
The third set of prioritized interventions suggested by 
OptForce is to remove fumarase (FUM) in the TCA cycle 
in order to maintain higher acetyl-CoA pool towards 
the C8 elongation chain. E. coli has three distinct fuma-
rase isozymes, encoded by fumA, fumB, and fumC [42]. 
Unlike fumB, the fumA and fumC genes are expressed 
primarily under aerobic conditions [43]. Therefore, 
fumA and fumC were selected as targets for disruption of 
aerobic fumarase activity. Since fumA and fumC are co-
transcribed, the two genes were deleted simultaneously, 
resulting in ΔfumAC strain. Results showed that ΔfumAC 
(TE10) decreased free C8 and total FAs production 
by 12% to 241 mg/L (18.7 mg/g glucose) and 277 mg/L 
relative to the starting strain MG1655 (TE10) (P < 0.01) 
(Table  2). The fourth set of prioritized interventions 
involves removal of phosphotransacetylase (PTA) and 
acetate kinase (ACK) in the acetate formation pathway 
(Ace module). Specifically, individual deletion of ackA 
or pta resulted in limited change in free C8 or total FAs 
production (Table 2), which is consistent with the prior 
observation of deletion effects on long-chain fatty acid 
production [44].
Taken together, among these interventions, engineer-
ing of the Fab module, especially the up-regulation of 
fabZ (+fabZ), imposed the highest improvement in C8 
production, which is in line with the prioritized order 
suggested by OptForce.
Combinatorial utilization of the suggested four 
interventions
While there are cases where individual interventions 
have improved the target yield [32], in this case for C8, 
OptForce suggests these interventions should be exam-
ined in their prioritized order. Actually, effects of mod-
ules with less priority such as FUM, Ace should be seen 
in conjunction with modules with high priority, such as 
Fab and Fad modules. Therefore, after knowing the effect 
of individual interventions on C8 production, combina-
torial utilization of interventions was performed with the 
aim of further C8 improvement, and the CRISPR–Cas9 
method, which has the advantages of iterative genome 
engineering, was further employed to construct these 
combinatorial strains [34].
As the +fabZ intervention in the Fab module enabled 
the highest increase in C8 production (+ 45%) (Table 2; 
Fig.  3), it was selected as the representative of the Fab 
module for subsequent implementation of other inter-
ventions. The suggested genes in the Fad module (fadE, 
fadB, fadA) were then individually deleted from the 
+fabZ (TE10) strain. However, no significant increase 
was observed in free C8 production (Table  3). Since 
+fabZ ΔfadE (TE10) was one of the best-performing 
strains after +fabZ Δfad engineering, it was therefore 
selected for the next round of FUM module engineering.

In contrast to the decreased C8 production by the 
ΔfumAC (TE10) strain, disruption of fumAC in the 
+fabZ ΔfadE (TE10) strain improved free C8 production 
(Table  3). Specifically, the triple +fabZ ΔfadE ΔfumAC 
(TE10) produced 408 mg/L of C8 (28.3 mg/g glucose) and 
515 mg/L of total FAs, which exceeds that of +fabZ ΔfadE 
(TE10) strain (C8 = 387  mg/L, 26.2  mg/g glucose; total 
FAs = 462 mg/L) by 5.4 and 11.5%, respectively (P = 0.04). 
This observation is in line with OptForce predictions 
that suggest an increase in octanoic acid yield due to

removal of fumarase activity only in the background of 
manipulations in the fatty acid synthesis and degrada-
tion pathways. This +fabZ ΔfadE ΔfumAC (TE10) strain 
was used for the next round engineering of Ace module 
engineering. Although deletion of pta in +fabZ ΔfadE 
ΔfumAC (TE10) did not further increase free C8 pro-
duction, deletion of ackA did substantially improve C8 
production (P = 0.009) (Fig. 3). Specifically, the resulting 
quadruple strain +fabZ ΔfadE ΔfumAC ΔackA (TE10) 
(ZEFA (TE10)) produced 442  mg/L of C8 (30.0  mg/g 
glucose) and 615  mg/L of total FAs, which exceeded 
that of +fabZ ΔfadE ΔfumAC (TE10) by approximately 
10 and 20% (C8 = 408  mg/L, 28.3  mg/g glucose; total 
FAs = 515  mg/L) (Table  3; Fig.  3). Compared with the 
starting strain +fabZ (TE10) (C8 = 398 mg/L, 26.9 mg/g 
glucose; total FAs = 479  mg/L), ZEFA (TE10) produced 
11 and 28% more C8 and total FAs (P = 0.002). Compared 
with the wild-type MG1655 (TE10) (C8 = 275  mg/L, 
19.9 mg/g glucose; total FAs = 315 mg/L), ZEFA (TE10) 
produced 61 and 95% more C8 and total FAs (P < 0.001) 
(Table  3; Fig.  3). Similar to deletion of ΔfumAC, this 
result also highlights the prioritized intervention strategy 
suggested by OptForce for overproduction of octanoic 
acid.
Optimization of culture conditions for octanoic acid 
production
In this study, gene for encoding thioesterase TE10 is 
expressed under the control of trc promoter, and thus 
IPTG serves as inducer for expression of TE10 gene 
and C8 production. However, although useful, excessive 
IPTG addition has been reported to be toxic to E. coli 
cells [45], resulting in inhibition of enzymatic activities 
and decreased product biosynthesis [46]. To this end, 
optimization of IPTG dosage for fatty acid production is 
desirable [47]. Since ZEFA (TE10) is the best-perform-
ing C8-producing strain obtained in this study, it was 
selected for IPTG dosage optimization. Results showed 
that the ZEFA (TE10) strain can still produce 117 mg/L 
of free C8 without addition of IPTG, which means there 
is leaky expression of TE10 gene under the trc promoter 
(Fig.  4a). Upon induction by IPTG, C8 titer elevated 
significantly and a positive correlation was observed 
between IPTG dosage and C8 titer up to 200 μM. At the 
dosage of 200 μM IPTG, ZEFA (TE10) strain produced 
430 mg/L of C8 and 678 mg/L of total FAs, which was 
3.7- and 2.4-fold of the non-IPTG condition (Fig.  4a). 
However, excessive dosage of IPTG, e.g., > 200 μM, was 
found to decrease C8 production (Fig. 4a).
The carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio has been observed 
to affect the production of biomass and fatty acid produc-
tion in some microorganisms [48]. In order to investigate 
the impact of the C/N ratio on free C8 production in the 
ZEFA (TE10) strain, we varied the initial C/N ratio in the 
M9 medium from 6.25 to 75.0 (Fig. 4b). Results showed 
that ZEFA (TE10) produced the highest C8 titer of 466 
and 730 mg/L of total FAs (IPTG = 200 μM) at the C/N 
ratio of 18.8, and either lower or higher C/N ratio was 
found to compromise C8 production (Fig. 4b).
In addition, we also found that medium acidification 
might be another limiting factor for free C8 produc-
tion. For instance, the final pH of ZEFA (TE10) culture 
broth in shake flasks at 72 h was approximately 5.5 (data 
not shown). Broth acidification can inflict detrimental 
effects to E. coli growth and activities of key metabolic 
enzymes [49]. Maintenance of pH at neutral range is 
expected to mitigate the acidification burden and thus 
possibly improve C8 production. To this end, a pH-con-
trolled bioreactor, instead of shake flasks, was employed. 
With this pH control, the ZEFA (TE10) strain produced 
500  mg/L of C8 and 805  mg/L of total FAs (pH = 7.0, 
IPTG = 200 μM), which is a 7.3 and 10.3% increase rela-
tive to shake flasks (C8 = 466  mg/L; TFA = 730  mg/L) 
(P < 0.05) (Fig.  4c), and a 82 and 155% increase rela-
tive to wild-type MG1655 (TE10) in shake flasks 
(C8 = 275 mg/L; total FAs = 315 mg/L) (P < 0.01).
Fed‑batch culture of strain ZEFA (TE10) for octanoic acid 
production
In this study, M9 medium with 1.5% (wt/v) glucose was 
used as culture broth for free C8 production. For the 
ZEFA (TE10) strain, we found that there was no resid-
ual glucose after 72-h cultivation in shake flasks (data 
not shown). Since glucose is the substrate, the provi-
sioning of additional glucose may increase C8 titers. To 
this end, fed-batch culture was performed to the ZEFA 
(TE10) strain with previously described optimized cul-
ture conditions, i.e., pH maintained at 7.0, IPTG added 
at 200  μM, and the initial C/N ratio kept at 18.8. Ini-
tially, 15 g/L of glucose was used as carbon source and 
another 15 g/L of fresh glucose was fed after 48-h cultiva-
tion (Fig. 5). Results showed that cell growth of the ZEFA 
(TE10) reached stationary phase at 24  h, and the final 
highest optical density ­(OD550) achieved 5.18 at 48  h. 
The total culture process lasted for 120 h and the ZEFA 
(TE10) consumed a total of 26.3 g/L of glucose, produced 
approximately 1 g/L of free C8 (38.5 mg/g glucose, 11% 
maximum theoretical yield) and 1.4  g/L of total FAs 
(Fig.  5). Furthermore, over 90% of the C8 is recovered 
in the medium (data not shown). To our knowledge, this 
is the highest free C8 titer achieved in minimal medium 
using E. coli inherent fatty acid biosynthesis pathway.

Discussion
In this study, we systematically engineered E. coli inher-
ent metabolism network for overproduction of free C8. 
Different from previous strategies, this work focuses on 
exploiting rational computational design to identify the 
metabolic targets. Finally, a total of ten enzymes in four 
different interventions (or modules) are suggested by 
OptForce to be manipulated production. Here we found 
the effects of manipulations on C8 production are in line 
well with OptForce predictions of prioritizing orders. 
Specifically, up-regulation of the Fab module is suggested 
to impose the most promising effect on C8 yield improve-
ment and the experimental result confirmed this conclu-
sion: increased expression of fabZ enabled the highest 
increase of C8 titer (+ 45%) in +fabZ (TE10) engineered 
strain. Although this study focuses on C8 production, 
the potential positive effect of +fabZ intervention was 
also observed in other cases, such as MCFA (C14–C16) 
production in E. coli [23]. In addition, in vitro titration 
experiment also showed that addition of purified FabZ

octanoic acid production. ZEFA (TE10) strain produced the highest titer of octanoic acid (430 mg/L) when induced with 200 μM IPTG for increasing 
expression of thioesterase TE10 gene. Cultures were performed in 40 mL M9+ 1.5% (wt/v) dextrose with the C/N ratio of 18.8 in 250-mL shake 
flasks at 250 rpm 30 °C with an initial pH of 7.0 and the IPTG was added when the ­OD550 reached 0.4–0.5. b Effects of different initial C/N ratios 
on octanoic acid production under 200 μM IPTG. ZEFA (TE10) strain has the highest C8 production at the C/N ratio of 18.8. For changing the C/N 
ratio, the glucose (carbon source) concentration is fixed at 15 g/L and the amount of ­NH4Cl (carbon source) added was varied accordingly. (C) 
Maintenance of culture broth pH at neutral range (pH = 7.0) increased octanoic acid production under 200 μM IPTG and C/N ratio of 18.8. Culture 
was performed in 300 mL M9+ 1.5% (wt/v) dextrose in a 500-mL bioreactor. Cultures were grown at 30 °C, and the pH was maintained at 7.0 by 
adding 2.0 M potassium hydroxide (KOH). Air flow rate was controlled at 0.3 L/min with 300 rpm as the initial stirring speed. The dissolved oxygen 
(DO) level was set over 40% and controlled by changing the stirring speed with the maximum of 600 rpm. Titers are the average of at least three 
replicates with error bars indicating one standard deviation. ZEFA, +fadZ ΔfadE ΔfumAC ΔackA

enzyme exhibits the highest increase in the rate of FAS 
reaction among different FAS subunits [50], which agrees 
with the effectiveness of +fabZ and the utility of the Opt-
Force prediction. Although +fabG has been shown effec-
tive in production of MCFA [51], it exhibits limited effect 
on C8 production in this study, which suggests the differ-
ences underlying MCFA and C8 biosynthesis.
In contrast to +fabZ, +fabB and +fabF were found 
to decrease C8 production and total fatty acids to some 
extent. Both +fabB and +fabF have been reported to 
speed up the acyl-ACP elongation, resulting in depletion 
of C8-ACP levels for C8 production; furthermore, the 
longer acyl-ACPs feedback inhibits the initiation step of 
fatty acid biosynthesis [17]. In an attempt to overcome 
this feedback inhibition by overexpressing fabZ together 
with fabG and fabB/fabF, +fabG and +fabB/F strains 
based on +fabZ were constructed and analyzed for fatty 
acid production (+fabZGB/+fabZGF, Additional file  2: 
Figure S1). The overexpression of fabZGB (+fabZGB) 
increased C8 and total fatty acid over the wild type but 
+fabZGF did not. Importantly, compared with +fabZ, 
both +fabZGB and +fabZGF decreased rather than 
increased C8 production and total fatty acid production 
(Table 2). Prior study of dynamic manipulation of FabB 
and FabF did result in enhanced production of C8 over 
the wild type in minimal media [17] but FabZ was not 
considered in that study. The complex regulation in this 
recursive biosynthetic system presents a challenge for 
optimizing C8 relative to total fatty acid production at 
the higher titers needed for industrial production.
Individual intervention of genes in Fad module, FUM 
module, and Ace module shows no significant positive 
or even negative effects on C8 production (Table  2). It 
is consistent with the prioritizing orders of OptForce 
predictions: all of these interventions should be seen 
effectiveness for C8 production when in conjunction 
with the Fab module. ΔfumAC alone was found to mod-
erately compromise cellular growth and C8 produc-
tion (Table 2). One possibility is that ΔfumAC alone will 
cause excessive accumulation of acetyl-CoA for compro-
mised TCA cycle which is the main sink for acetyl-CoA 
catabolic metabolism. In this study, we observed that 
+fabZ/ΔfadE manipulations based on ΔfumAC instead 
significantly increased cellular growth and C8 produc-
tion (Additional file 3: Figure S2). This phenomenon can 
be explained well by +fabZ which effectively channels 
excessive acetyl-CoA into C8 biosynthesis and ΔfadE also 
alleviates further accumulation of acetyl-CoA sourcing 
from fatty acid degradation. In addition, since the TCA 
cycle serves as a primary source for ATP and NAD(P)H 
factors, compromised TCA cycle activity from ΔfumAC 
might impair cell energy metabolism [52]. Prior stud-
ies found that increasing ATP energy supply improved 
fatty acid production under high cell density condition 
[53]. Hence, balancing the flux between entering into cell 
energy metabolism and fatty acid biosynthesis should be 
cautiously considered.
After combinatorial utilization of Fad, FUM, and Ace 
modules based on Fab module according to the sug-
gested prioritizing order, we finally obtained the best

C8 production strain E. coli ZEFA (TE10). Overall, the 
manipulations of +fabZ, ΔfadE, ΔfumAC, and ΔackA 
in ZEFA (TE10) have a synergistic role in increasing C8 
production: +fabZ primarily strengthens C8 biosynthesis 
pathway efficiency, ΔfadE eliminates β-oxidation of C8 
degradation, and ΔfumAC in the TCA cycle and ΔackA in 
acetate formation maintain a higher acetyl-CoA pool for 
channeling into C8 biosynthesis pathway strengthened 
by +fabZ. All of these interventions enabled the ZEFA 
(TE10) strain to produce 1 g/L of free C8 in M9 medium, 
which is the highest titer under minimal medium using 
E. coli native fatty acid biosynthesis mechanism to our 
knowledge (Table 1).
It is to be noted that OptForce does not suggest the 
increased production of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) 
for C8 production, which is supposed to drive more 
acetyl-CoA flux to malonyl-CoA for C8 biosynthesis. In 
order to investigate the effect of increasing production 
of ACC on C8 production, +accABCD was performed in 
our engineered strain. However, no improvement in free 
C8 production was observed (Additional file  4: Figure 
S3), indicating that acetyl-CoA carboxylation might be 
not one of the bottlenecks for C8 production. This result 
is consistent with previous observations that increased 
production of ACC did not lead to significant increase in 
production of MCFA [8, 16].
In this study, besides genetic interventions, we also 
optimized the culture conditions for C8 production, 
e.g., IPTG dosage, C/N ratio, and control of pH at neu-
tral range, all of which were found to contribute to free 
C8 production. However, although C8 titer and yield 
in ZEFA (TE10) strain after four rounds of engineering 
increased significantly compared with the starting strain, 
it is still lower than the predicted result of OptForce. Spe-
cifically, OptForce predicted to yield almost 90% of the 
theoretical maximum of C8 production (~ 0.34 g/g glu-
cose), while only 11% (0.0385  g/g glucose) was experi-
mentally achieved in ZEFA (TE10). OptForce predictions 
are solely based on stoichiometric limitations with no 
underlying kinetic and regulatory constraints, while these 
factors are significant contributors towards limiting car-
bon flux [31, 33]. In addition, low catalytic capacity of thi-
oesterase TE10 used here for hydrolysis of octanoyl-ACP, 
the complex regulation of the recursive fatty acid biosyn-
thesis pathway which complicates the balance of C8 and 
longer chain fatty acids at high titers, and importantly, 
toxicity from the end-product of C8 might also compro-
mise strain performance and thus C8 titer and yield [49, 
54]. Prior research has shown that octanoic acid toxicity 
increases at lower pH values, particularly as the media 
pH nears the molecule pKa [49, 54]. Considering that 
membrane damage is deemed as a fundamental mecha-
nism of fatty acid toxicity, and membrane engineering 
has proven its effectiveness in alleviating membrane 
damage from fatty acids [30, 55–58], it is reasonable to 
expect that application of these membrane engineering 
strategies combined with the metabolic interventions 
here will contribute to further C8 improvement in the 
future.
Recent research about biosynthesis of SCFA (C6–C10, 
they defined as MCFA there) in E. coli via introduction of 
the non-native reverse beta-oxidation cycle (r-BOX) has 
led to titers of > 1 g/L in rich medium [59]. Heterologous 
thiolases and trans-enoyl-CoA reductase in conjunction 
with endogenous FadB and thioesterase were activated 
for operation of r-BOX. Although a high titer of SCFA 
in rich medium was achieved (3.8 g/L), the SCFA was a 
mixture of C4, C6, C8, and C10. Due to the r-BOX inher-
ent characteristic of operation in an iterative manner [14, 
60, 61], it may be challenging to narrow down the MCFA 
to a specific length. In this study, we selectively produced 
C8 from the other fatty acids, which then enables more 
efficient recovery of the desired product.
In summary, by implementing a minimal set of meta-
bolic interventions, we have successfully engineered E. 
coli MG1655 inherent metabolism network and achieved 
the high production and selectivity of C8. Besides C8, 
this strategy which integrates computational strain 
design and experimental study is expected to be applica-
ble to production of other biorenewables.
Conclusions
In this study, a combination of integrated computational 
and experimental approach was performed to manipu-
late the E. coli native metabolic network for octanoic acid 
(C8) production. Four interventions were subsequently 
predicted by a customized OptForce methodology. Then, 
all the ten associated candidate proteins were regulated 
individually and combinatorially. +FabZ was identified 
as the most prominent individual intervention and the 
final combinatorial strain based on +FabZ eventually 
produced 1 g/L of C8 with high selectivity in minimum 
medium using glucose as single carbon. This work under-
lines the significance of integration of computational 
strain design and experimental testing in rewiring micro-
bial metabolism for octanoic acid production. This result 
besides other studies using OptForce in strain design 
demonstrates that this strategy may be also applicable to 
engineering E. coli for production of other customized 
biorenewable chemicals or biofuels.

with a strong constitutive M1-93 promoter [30, 58] was 
inserted into chromosomal DNA of MG1655 at mgsA 
site. For octanoic acid production, the pJMYEEI82564 
plasmid [30, 62], harboring the Anaerococcus tetradius 
thioesterase (TE10) that primarily hydrolyzes octanoyl-
ACP [29], was transformed into our engineered strains. 
When necessary, ampicillin, kanamycin, and chloram-
phenicol were used at a final concentration of 100, 50, 
and 34 mg/L, respectively.
Using OptForce for octanoic acid overproduction
OptForce optimization algorithm was used for identi-
fying a prioritized intervention strategy for octanoate 
overproduction. The iAF1260 genome-scale metabolic 
(GSM) model in E. coli [63] was used for all the simula-
tions under aerobic minimal conditions with glucose as 
the sole carbon substrate. A couple of modifications were 
made to the original GSM model (for example, activa-
tion of the beta-oxidation pathway reactions regulated 
off in the original model) based on prior experimental 
observations [13, 31]. Details of the modification, along 
with the flux bounds for exchange reactions for media 
metabolites, have been tabulated in Additional file  6: 
Text S1. Description of the sequential steps for imple-
mentation of the entire OptForce algorithm, along with 
details of the optimization formulations in each step, 
has been described elsewhere [31, 64]. In short, 13C-
MFA for a wild-type E. coli strain [31] is imposed on the 
GSM model to characterize its native phenotype. This 
phenotype is contrasted to an overproduction pheno-
type producing octanoate at least 90% of its theoretical 
maximum capability (as well as a minimum growth-rate 
of 10% of its theoretical maximum). The contrast reveals 
a subset of reactions that “MUST” be altered (directly or 
indirectly) from their native activity to ensure octanoate 
overproduction. Note that the MUST set of reactions can 
be identified for increasing levels of complexity. At the 
“singles” level, individual reactions whose overproduc-
tion flux range has no overlap with the corresponding 
flux range in the native phenotype (either as an up-reg-
ulation or a down-regulation) are identified (i.e., MUST 
singles). The same analysis can be extended to identify 
pairs, triplets, or higher combination of reactions whose 
sum (or difference) of fluxes in the overproduction phe-
notype completely departs from the corresponding flux 
combination in the wild-type phenotype, even though 
their individual flux ranges have an overlap. This leads 
towards identification of MUST pairs, triples, and higher

order sets. For the current simulation, the analysis as 
limited to doubles due to relative abundance of target 
reactions identified in the MUST sets. Finally, a bilevel 
optimization algorithm identifies a prioritized list of 
interventions from the MUST set of reactions that must 
be directly engineered to improve octanoate yield. See

In vivo production of C8 in shake flask
Individual colonies were selected from Luria Broth 
(LB) plates with ampicillin, inoculated into 3 mL of LB 
liquid medium with ampicillin for 4 h. Then, 0.5 mL of 
culture was added to 10 mL M9 (0.8 g/L ­NH4Cl, 0.5 g/L 
NaCl, 7.52  g/L ­Na2HPO4, 3.0  g/L ­KH2PO4, 0.24  g/L 
­MgSO4, 11.1  mg/L ­CaCl2, 1  mg/L thiamine HCl, and 
trace elements containing 166.7  μg/L ­FeCl3·6H2O, 
1.8  μg/L ­ZnSO4·7H2O, 1.2  μg/L ­CuCl2·2H2O, 1.2  μg/L 
­MnSO4·2H2O, 1.8  μg/L ­CoCl2·6H2O, and 0.223  mg/L 
­Na2EDTA·2H2O) with 1.5% (wt/v) dextrose at 30  °C, 
220  rpm overnight for seed-culture preparation. Mid-
log phase seed-culture was transferred into 40  mL M9 
with 1.5% (wt/v) dextrose medium at the final concen-
tration of ­OD550 ~ 0.1. For inducing TE10 gene expres-
sion, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was 
typically added at a final concentration of 1  mM when 
the ­OD550 reached 0.4–0.5. Cultures were grown in 250-
mL baffled flasks with initial pH 7.0 at 30 °C, 220 rpm 
for 72 h. In M9 minimal medium, 0.8 g/L of ammonium 
chloride ­(NH4Cl) was used as the only nitrogen source, 
resulting in a standard C/N ratio of 18.8. For changing 
the C/N ratio, the glucose (carbon source) concentration 
was fixed at 15 g/L and the ­NH4Cl (carbon source) was 
added at final concentrations of 0.2, 0.4, 1.6, and 2.4 g/L, 
corresponding to C/N ratios of 75, 37.5, 9.4, and 6.25, 
respectively.
In vivo production of C8 in bioreactor
Batch cultures were performed in 300  mL M9+ 1.5% 
(wt/v) dextrose in 500-mL bioreactor (INFORS HT). Cul-
tures were grown at 30 °C, and the pH was maintained 
at 7.0 by adding 2.0  M potassium hydroxide (KOH). 
Air flow rate was initially maintained at 0.3 L/min. The 
dissolved oxygen (DO) level was set over 40% and con-
trolled by changing the stirring speed, with a maximum 
value of 600 rpm. Similar operations were performed for 
fed-batch culture, the only difference being that a 9 mL 
of 50% (wt/v) glucose was fed to the cultures after 48-h 
cultivation.
Determination of carboxylic acid titers
Carboxylic acid production was quantified by an Agilent 
7890 gas chromatograph equipped with an Agilent 5975 
mass spectroscope using mass spectrometer (GC–MS) 
after carboxylic acid extraction [17]. Briefly, 1 mL of cul-
ture was mixed with 125 μL of 10% (wt/v) sodium chlo-
ride and 125 μL of acetic acid. Then, 20 μL of 1 mg/mL 
internal standards (C9:0/C13:0/C15:0/C17:0) was added 
into the mixture followed by 500 μL of ethyl acetate. The 
mixture was vortexed for 30  s and then centrifuged at 
16,000×g for 10 min. After that, 250 μL of top organic 
phase was transferred to a new glass tube followed by 
addition of 2.25  mL of ethanol:hydrochloric acid (30:1 
v/v). After incubation at 55 °C for 1 h, 1.25 mL of dou-
ble-distilled water ­(ddH2O) and 1.25 mL of hexane were 
added, vortexed, and centrifuged at 2000×g for 2  min. 
The top hexane layer was then transferred and ana-
lyzed by GC–MS. The temperature for GC–MS analysis 
was initially held at 50 °C for 2 min, ramped to 200 °C 
at 25 °C/min, held for 1 min, and then raised to 315 °C 
at 25 °C/min, held for 2 min. Helium was used as a car-
rier gas and the flow rate was set as 1 mL/min through a 
DB-5MS separation column (30 m, 0.25 mm ID, 0.25 μm, 
Agilent).
Statistical analysis
The two-tailed t test method (two-sample equal variance, 
homoscedastic) was employed to analyze the statistical 
significance of all the data in this study and P value < 0.05 
is deemed statistically significant.
