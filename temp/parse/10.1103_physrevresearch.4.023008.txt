The layered perovskite YBaCuFeO5 is a rare example of a cycloidal spiral magnet whose ordering temperature
Tspiral can be tuned far beyond room temperature by adjusting the degree of Cu2+/Fe3+ chemical disorder in the
structure. This unusual property qualiﬁes this material as one of the most promising spin-driven multiferroic
candidates. However, very little is known about the response of the spiral to magnetic ﬁelds, crucial for mag-
netoelectric cross-control applications. Using bulk magnetization and neutron powder diffraction measurements
under magnetic ﬁelds up to 9 T, we report here a temperature-magnetic ﬁeld phase diagram of this material.
Besides revealing a strong stability of the spiral state, our data uncover the presence of weak ferromagnetism
coexisting with the spiral modulation. Since ferromagnets can be easily manipulated with magnetic ﬁelds, this
observation opens new perspectives for the control of the spiral orientation, directly linked to the polarization
direction, as well as for a possible future use of this material in technological applications.

I. INTRODUCTION
Multiferroic materials, in particular those where electric
polarization coexists with magnetic order, have attracted a
great deal of interest in fundamental physics [1–5]. In parallel,
some of them are in the center of attention of applied sciences
due to the strong coupling between their electric and magnetic
orders, which could be exploited in low-power magneto-
electric applications [4–8]. Among these materials, frustrated
magnets with ordered spiral phases are particularly promis-
ing because the noncollinear spiral magnetic order breaks
space-inversion symmetry and can induce spontaneous polar-
ization P [2,9] through inverse Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya [10,11]
or spin-current mechanisms [12]. The common origin of po-
larization and spiral order guarantees a substantial coupling,
which is highly desirable for applications. However, the low
ordering temperatures of most spiral magnets (typically <
50 K) make their implementation in real-life devices unprac-
tical. Another major disadvantage is that spiral phases are in
general antiferromagnetic, making quite difﬁcult reading and
controlling the spiral helicity, directly related to the polariza-
tion direction.
To date, only a few materials featuring either spontaneous
or magnetic-ﬁeld-induced magnetization coexisting with spi-
ral magnetic order in the same phase have been reported.

Examples of them are the conical magnets CoCr2O4 [13],
ZnCr2Se4 [14], Ba2Mg2Fe12O22 [15], and Mn2GeO4 [16].
This last material is particularly interesting because in con-
trast with the other examples, spontaneous magnetization
and spin-driven polarization appear along the same direc-
tion, and modest magnetic ﬁelds can reverse simultaneously
both ferroic variables while keeping the domain structure
unchanged [17]. Unfortunately, this happens at very low tem-
peratures (∼6 K). It will be thus desirable to identify other
materials with coupled magnetization and spiral magnetic or-
der coexisting at higher temperatures.
The layered perovskite YBaCuFeO5, object of the present
study, is one of the rare exceptions where spiral magnetic
order can be stabilized at temperatures beyond RT [18,19].
But what makes this material truly exceptional compared
with other high-temperature spiral magnets [15,20–22] is the
extraordinary tunability of the spiral ordering temperature
(Tspiral), which can be increased from 154 to 310 K upon
enhancing the degree of Cu2+/Fe3+ chemical disorder in the
structure. As shown in Fig. 1(a), these two cations occupy
the bipyramidal units in the tetragonal layered perovskite unit
cell (space group P4mm) [23,24]. Contrary to Ba2+ and Y3+,
which order in layers perpendicular to the c crystal axis, Cu2+
and Fe3+ display a very particular type of correlated disorder
characterized by the preferential occupation of the bipyramids
by ferromagnetically coupled Cu-Fe pairs. These pairs are
disordered in the structure, with the degree of disorder—and
hence Tspiral—being strongly dependent on the preparation
method [18].

This collinear arrangement, shown in Fig. 1(a), is indeed
observed experimentally, but at only high temperatures
(Tspiral < T < Tcollinear
[24,25]).
At
lower
temperatures
(T < Tspiral) it is replaced by an inclined spiral described
by the propagation vector ki = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2 ± q) and
schematically shown in Fig. 1(a) [24], whose cycloidal
component could induce ferroelectricity [10–12,26]. The
observation of incommensurate magnetic order beyond RT in
a crystal structure without any apparent source of frustration
was puzzling, and the gigantic, positive impact of the Fe/Cu
disorder in the stability of the spiral seemed at odds with
traditional frustration mechanisms [24]. Interestingly, both
observations were recently rationalized in terms of a novel,
disorder-based frustration mechanism based on the gigantic
impact of a few Fe-Fe “defects” occupying the bipyramidal
units, which host majoritarily Cu-Fe pairs [27,28]. Since the
coupling JFe-Fe between the two Fe3+ moments in one such
defect is antiferromagnetic and about 100 times stronger
that the weakly ferromagnetic JCu-Fe coupling, a tiny defect
concentration (2% to 5% of the bipyramids occupied by Fe-Fe
pairs) is enough to destroy the collinear order and stabilize
a spiral where both Tspiral and the magnetic modulation
parameter q are proportional to the defect concentration [28].
According
to
neutron
powder
diffraction
investiga-
tions [18,19,24,29], the inclined spiral phase of YBaCuFeO5
is antiferromagnetic without a net spontaneous magnetization.
However, given the (usually strong) response of frustrated
magnets to external magnetic ﬁelds, low-ﬁeld incommensu-
rate conical phases as those reported for ZnCr2Se4 [14] and
some hexaferrites [30] could exist in YBaCuFeO5 as well.
Since the stability of the spiral phase can be extended from
RT up to ∼400 K by replacing 40% of Ba by Sr, and the
cycloidal component can be tuned in different ways [19,29],
the presence of a ﬁeld-induced conical phase in YBaCuFeO5
with net magnetization could result in a material with interest-
ing potential for magnetoelectric applications [31]. Motivated
by this possibility, we report here a systematic investigation
of the YBaCuFeO5 magnetic phase diagram in a broad tem-
perature (2–300 K) and magnetic ﬁeld range (0–9 T). Using
magnetometry and powder neutron diffraction under magnetic
ﬁeld, we reveal the presence of three distinct magnetic phases.
Moreover, we uncover the existence of weak ferromagnetism

coexisting with the spiral modulation that can be switched
using modest magnetic ﬁelds.
II. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS
A. Sample synthesis
The procedure for obtaining YBaCuFeO5 ceramics with
adjustable Tspiral temperatures has been reported previ-
ously [18,19,24]. The polycrystalline sample used in this
study was prepared by solid state reaction. As precursors we
used high-purity stoichiometric amounts of Y2O3 (99.999%,
Aldrich), BaCO3 (99.997%, Alfa Aesar), CuO (99.995%, Alfa
Aesar), and Fe2O3 (99.998%, Alfa Aesar) that were weighted,
thoroughly mixed, and ﬁred at 1150 ◦C for 50 h under oxygen
gas ﬂow. The resulting black powder was grounded again,
pelletized under 4 kbar in the form of a long rod (D ∼5.6 mm,
L ∼5 cm), then sintered at 1150 ◦C for 50 h in air, and
ﬁnally cooled down to room temperature at a rate of 300
K/h. According to Ref. [18], this cooling rate should result
in a Tspiral value close to ∼240 K, and a Tcollinear ∼440 K.
The sample purity was checked by laboratory x-ray powder
diffraction (Brucker D8 Advance, Cu Kα) that revealed an
excellent crystallinity and conﬁrmed the absence of impurity
phases within the detection limit of this technique (< 1%).
B. Magnetometry
Magnetization M and AC susceptibility measurements χAC
were performed in a superconducting quantum interference
device magnetometer (MPMS-XL, 7 T), and a Physical Prop-
erties Measuring System (PPMS, 9 T) from Quantum Design.
A cylindrical YBaCuFeO5 pellet (L ∼3.8 mm, D ∼5.6 mm,
m ∼520.7 mg) was cut from the same cylinder used for
powder neutron diffraction measurements and mounted on
a transparent drinking straw. The temperature dependence
of the magnetization M(T ) was investigated between 5 and
300 K under magnetic ﬁelds up to 7.0 T using zero-ﬁeld
cooled warming (ZFC), ﬁeld cooled cooling (FCC), and ﬁeld
cooled warming (FCW) experimental protocols while slowly
ramping the temperature at a cooling/heating rate of 1 K/min.
The ﬁeld dependence of the magnetization M(H) was mea-
sured at selected temperatures between 20 and 300 K and
magnetic ﬁelds between 0 and 9 T after cooling the sample
in zero ﬁeld. After each ﬁeld scan, the magnetic ﬁeld was
set to zero before heating to the next temperature. Addition-
ally, full M-H hysteresis cycles with ﬁelds between −7 and
+7 T were conducted at selected temperatures T < Tspiral. The
temperature dependence of the AC susceptibility χAC(T ) was
measured with an AC ﬁeld of 15 Oe at several frequencies be-
tween 100 and 10 000 Hz. The measurement were conducted
by heating after cooling the sample to 5 K in zero ﬁeld.
C. Neutron diffraction under magnetic ﬁeld
Powder neutron diffraction (PND) measurements were car-
ried out at the Institut Laue Langevin (ILL) in Grenoble,
France. To avoid the displacement of the crystallites under the
action of the magnetic ﬁeld, we used a sintered YBaCuFeO5
ceramic bar (see Sample Synthesis) that was ﬁxed with alu-
minum foil inside of a cylindrical vanadium can. The can was
mounted on the stick of a cryomagnet, and cooled down to
1.5 K. PND patterns were continuously recorded at the pow-
der diffractometer D20 [Ge(224), take-off angle 90◦, 2θmax =
140◦, 2θstep = 0.05◦, λ = 2.41 Å] [32] while ramping the ﬁeld
up to 9 T at various temperatures between 1.5 and 300 K.
After each ﬁeld scan, the magnetic ﬁeld was set to zero before
heating to the next temperature. A NAC powder sample was
used as reference for determining the wavelengths and zero
offsets. The background from the sample environment was
minimized using an oscillating radial collimator.
All NPD data were analyzed using the Lebail method [33],
as implemented in the diffraction analysis package FullProf
Suite [34]. The Rietveld method [35] could not be used due
to the presence of preferred orientations (unavoidable due
the high pressure pelletizing process), whose impact in the
integrated intensities could not be satisfactorily described with
any of the models available in the FullProf Suite software.
The Lebail analysis was thus used to determine the ﬁeld
and temperature dependence of the lattice parameters and
the magnetic propagation vector. The ﬁeld dependence of the
integrated intensities of the magnetic reﬂection (1/2, 1/2,
1/2) and its incommensurate satellites (1/2, 1/2, 1/2 ± q)
was determined separately by ﬁtting their diffraction proﬁles
with Gaussian functions. The details of the ﬁtting procedure
are presented in the Appendix.
III. RESULTS
A. Magnetometry
As a ﬁrst step to establish the H-T phase diagram, we
investigated the temperature dependence of the magnetization
M(T ) at ﬁxed magnetic ﬁelds. Representative curves showing
the temperature dependence of the magnetization per unit
formula measured using zero ﬁeld cooled (ZFC) and ﬁeld
cooled (FCC/FCW) protocols are shown in Figs. 1(b)–1(d).
We attribute the pronounced anomaly observed in the three
curves to the collinear-to-spiral transition, an assignment fur-
ther conﬁrmed by neutron powder diffraction measurements
(see next sections). The Tspiral value, deﬁned here as the zero
of the partial derivative ∂M/∂T , is ∼245 K for the curve mea-
sured at 1 T. This value is very close to that expected from the
chosen synthetic route, and in excellent agreement with the
reported value on samples prepared in similar conditions [18].
The application of a magnetic ﬁeld has a detrimental effect
in Tspiral, which decreases from ∼245 K at 1 T to ∼215 K at
7 T at an approximately linear rate of ∼8 K/T. We also ob-
serve a remarkably different behavior above and below Tspiral.
As shown in Figs. 1(b)–1(d), the ZFC, FCC, and FCW curves
are indistinguishable in the collinear phase (T > Tspiral). This
is not anymore the case below the spiral ordering temperature,
where the splitting of the three curves signals the presence
of pronounced thermal hysteresis and magnetic irreversibility
effects.
The thermal hysteresis affects the FCC (red) and FCW
(blue) curves, which bifurcate below Tspiral and merge again
at a temperature that decreases for increasing magnetic ﬁelds.
The impact of the ﬁeld in the broadening of the hysteretic
region can be better appreciated in Fig. 1(e), showing the
difference between both curves Mhyst = MFCC −MFCW at

various magnetic ﬁelds. The presence of thermal hysteresis,
characteristic of ﬁrst-order phase transitions, is uncommon for
a transition between antiferromagnetic phases, and suggests
that the collinear and spiral phases coexist in a ﬁeld-dependent
temperature region below Tspiral.
The existence of magnetic irreversibility below Tspiral is
revealed by the difference between the curves measured by
warming after cooling with and without ﬁeld (FCW/ZFC).
This effect, more pronounced for high magnetic ﬁelds, is illus-
trated in Fig. 1(f), showing the difference between both curves
Mirr = MFCW −MZFC at various magnetic ﬁelds. The irre-
versible magnetization Mirr, negligibly small above Tspiral,
rises sharply below this temperature and displays a broad
maximum that approximately coincides with the middle point
of the hysteretic region. At lower temperatures, in the region
without hysteresis in the FCC/FCW curves, Mirr is only
weakly temperature dependent. In contrast, it displays a pro-
nounced, nonlinear ﬁeld dependence, illustrated by the Mirr
values at selected temperatures shown in Fig. 1(g). We note
also that the observation of irreversibility only below Tspiral
excludes an origin based on the presence of ferromagnetic
impurities, favoring instead an intrinsic origin linked to the
presence of the spiral phase.
1. Weak ferromagnetism
Intrinsic irreversibility in frustrated antiferromagnets with
chemical disorder may have different origins, the most com-
mon being either the presence of weak ferromagnetism
(WFM), or the existence of a spin-glass state. The main dif-
ference between them is the metastability of the spin-glass
state, whose response to external stimuli is characterized by
complex, time-dependent relaxation phenomena [36]. This
has characteristic signatures in frequency-dependent measure-
ments such as the AC susceptibility, where the real part
χ′
AC(T ) shows a cusp at a temperature Tf with pronounced
dependence on the frequency of the AC driving ﬁeld (Tf is the
temperature at which the spin glass is frozen at a timescale
τ equal to the inverse of the experimentally used frequency
ω = 2π/τ). The imaginary part χ′′
AC(T ) displays also a dis-
tinctive behavior: it begins to increase above the maximum
in χ′
AC(T ), has an inﬂection point which coincides with the
peak in χ′
AC(T ), and peaks shortly afterwards before dropping
down to zero at low temperatures. These phenomena are not
observed for magnetic systems in thermodynamic equilib-
rium, where χ′′
AC(T ) = 0, and the χ′
AC(T ) cusps, if any, are
frequency independent.
To disentangle the two possible origins of the observed ir-
reversibility, we measured χAC(T ) at six different frequencies
covering approximately three decades. As shown in Fig. 2,
the only cusp observed in χ′
AC(T ) coincides with Tspiral and
displays no appreciable frequency dependence. Moreover,
χ′′
AC(T ) is featureless and negligibly small in the full temper-
ature range investigated. These observations are at variance
with the behavior reported for spin-glass systems [36,37],
and favor a weak ferromagnetic origin for the irreversibility
observed below Tspiral.
Further experimental evidence supporting the presence of
WFM is provided by the ﬁeld dependence of the magneti-
zation curves. Figure 3 shows the M-H cycles measured at
FIG. 2. Temperature dependence of the real and imaginary parts

5 K after cooling the sample in zero ﬁeld [Fig. 3(a)] and
under 7 T [Fig. 3(b)]. The ZFC curve presents the linear
shape typical of antiferromagnets, indicating that, at this tem-
perature, the WFM domains formed below Tspiral are exactly
compensated and the applied ﬁelds are not large enough to
align them. A completely different behavior is observed when
the sample is cooled in ﬁeld. As shown in Fig. 3(b), a small
hysteresis loop superimposed to the linear antiferromagnetic
response is clearly observed. This is better appreciated in
Figs. 3(c) and 3(d), measured using a special protocol similar
to the so-called PUND (positive-up negative-down) method
employed to measure electric polarization-electric ﬁeld hys-
teresis cycles in ferroelectrics [38]. This procedure, which
allows us to separate the switchable and nonswitchable com-
ponents [39], involves four steps (or “pulses”) schematically
shown in Fig. 3(e). The sample is ﬁrst cooled under the
maximal positive magnetic ﬁeld (+7 T) down to the desired
temperature in order to align the ferromagnetic domains and
create a positive magnetization, after which H is set to zero.
The ﬁeld is then ramped to −7 T and back to zero two times.
Since the switchable part of M will be reversed during the
ﬁrst pulse, but not during the second, it can be obtained by
subtracting the M(H) curves measured during the ﬁrst and
second ﬁeld pulses. The positive-ﬁeld part can be obtained in
a similar way after ramping the ﬁeld to +7 T and back to zero
two times [third and fourth pulses in Fig. 3(e)].
The switchable part of the magnetization at selected tem-
peratures obtained using this procedure is shown in Fig. 3(d).
Well deﬁned M-H cycles are observed at T < Tspiral, with a
remnant magnetization that decreases with temperature and
virtually disappears in the collinear phase [Fig. 3(f)]. At
5 K the coercive ﬁeld is ∼0.7 T, similar to that obtained
using the standard procedure [Fig. 3(b)], and the remnant
magnetization is about 3 × 10−4 μB/formula unit. This value
is far below the 6 μB expected from a full alignment of
the the Fe3+ and Cu2+ magnetic moments (5 and 1 μB
assuming free-ion values), but comparable to the values re-
ported for other weak ferromagnets [40,41]. This indicates
that the uncompensated magnetization arises most likely from
a tiny misalignment of the (majoritarily antiferromagnetically

coupled) Cu2+ and Fe3+ moments. An upper limit to the
magnetic ﬁeld Hsat needed to reach the fully saturated state
can be estimated by extrapolating the linear dependence of
the magnetization observed at 20 K (Fig. 4). Assuming the
absence of ﬁeld-induced phase transitions and a saturation
value of 6 μB per unit formula we obtain a ﬁeld close to
1000 T. Although this value is larger than the actual Hsat, it
indicates that the energy scale of the leading magnetic interac-
tions in this material is extremely large. This is consistent with
the high ordering temperatures reported for YBaCuFeO5 (425
to 455 K [18,19]), the large, negative Curie-Weiss constants
indicative of strong, predominantly antiferromagnetic interac-
tions (−790 to −893 K [25,42,43]), and with the estimations
of the exchange constants from DFT calculations [24], some
of them reaching values as high as ∼135 meV.
2. Field-induced transitions
Magnetic orders arising from frustrated interactions—such
as magnetic spirals—are expected to display a strong response
to magnetic ﬁelds that may led to the suppression of the spiral
state and the stabilization of new magnetic phases [44,45].
Because the response of these phases to magnetic ﬁelds is
usually different from that of the original magnetic order, their
emergence can be easily detected by monitoring the slope
changes in the isothermal M(H) magnetization curves. For
YBaCuFeO5, examples of such curves measured at ﬁelds up
to 9 T at selected temperatures between 20 and 300 K are
shown in Fig. 4(a). (See Fig. 11 in the Appendix for an ex-
tended data set.) Before starting the measurements, the sample
was ﬁrst zero-ﬁeld cooled down to 20 K. The magnetic ﬁeld
was then increased in steps up to 9 T, and set to zero before
heating to the next temperature.
At 20 K, we note that M is a linear function of H with-
out any clear inﬂection point. This is better appreciated in
the ∂M/∂H derivative, which is constant within the inves-
tigated H range [Fig. 4(b)]. The M(H) linearity subsists up
to ∼140 K, but between this temperature and Tspiral a slope
change with hysteresis indicative of a ﬁrst-order transition
is clearly observed. The transition is particularly evident in
the ﬁrst derivative curves, exempliﬁed in Fig. 4(c) by the
data measured at 180 K through a full M(H) hysteresis cy-
cle. We note that both the magnetic ﬁeld H1, corresponding
maximum of ∂M/∂H, and the width of the hysteretic re-
gion decrease by approaching Tspiral ∼245 K. Above this
temperature, and up to 300 K, we still observe a slope
change, albeit less pronounced, with a maximum at H2 = 2 T
[Fig. 4(d) see also Fig. 12 in the Appendix for an extended
data set]. Contrarily to H1, H2 is temperature independent
and shows no hysteresis, suggesting that slope change at 2 T

corresponds to a distinct, possibly second-order ﬁeld-induced
transition.
B. Powder neutron diffraction
To get insight on the nature of the ﬁeld-induced magnetic
phases, we conducted NPD measurements under magnetic
ﬁeld. One should nevertheless mention that the interpretation
is in general not as straightforward as in the case of a single
crystal. This is because the ﬁeld-induced magnetic conﬁgu-
ration of a particular grain will strongly depend on the grain
orientation with respect to the external magnetic ﬁeld, which
is in turn correlated with the geometry of the diffraction pro-
cess. Moreover, the use of a sintered rod, necessary to avoid
the movement of the grains under the action of the magnetic
ﬁeld, results in the existence of preferential orientations that
makes a quantitative analysis of the magnetic Bragg reﬂection
intensities extremely difﬁcult. For these reasons we discuss
here exclusively the evolution of two variables. On one side,
the position of the magnetic Bragg reﬂections, which pro-
vides information about the ﬁeld dependence of the magnetic
propagation vector. On the other, the ﬁeld dependence of the
magnetic intensities relative to that of the zero-ﬁeld patterns,
where the observation of a clear discontinuity at ∼2 T pro-
vides additional support to the existence of the ﬁeld-induced
transition inferred from the magnetization data.

patterns, the nuclear Bragg reﬂections can be indexed with
a tetragonal cell of P4mm symmetry. At RT, the reﬂections
of magnetic origin correspond to the propagation vector kc =
(1/2, 1/2, 1/2), and at 1.5 K, to an incommensurate modu-
lation with ki = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2 ± q) as reported in previous
works [18,19,24]. At 1.5 K the q value is ∼0.115, very close of
the value expected from the universal law relating q and Tspiral
(q ∼0.117) [19,28]. The temperature dependence of the (1/2,
1/2, 1/2) and (1/2, 1/2, 1/2 ± q) magnetic reﬂections, their
integrated intensities, and the magnetic modulation vector q
are shown in Figs. 6(a)–6(c). In the spiral phase, q and the
integrated intensities of the magnetic satellites decrease with
temperature and vanish above Tspiral, where they are replaced
by the commensurate reﬂection (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). As expected,
the Tspiral value (∼250 K) measured at H = 0 and deﬁned here
as the maximum of the (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) reﬂection is slightly
higher than the value inferred from the M(T ) measurements
at 1 T [∼245 K, Fig. 1(b)]. As in previous works [18,19,24],
we observe here phase coexistence at low temperatures, which
is quite signiﬁcant between Tspiral and ∼180 K. Below this

temperature the fraction of collinear phase becomes nearly
constant and very close to the detection limit. However, it
is worth mentioning that the wavelength used in this study
makes it difﬁcult to extract small values of the (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)
integrated intensity due to the superposition with the tails of
the incommensurate satellites (see the Appendix for details
on the ﬁtting procedure). The nonzero values obtained below
200 K should be thus considered with caution. Interestingly,
the point where the temperature dependence of the (1/2,
1/2, 1/2) integrated intensity starts to deviate from linearity
(∼180 K) is reasonably close to the lower phase coexistence
limit inferred from magnetometry. Hence, we use here this
simple criterion to deﬁne the lower phase coexistence bound-
ary from NPD data. Measurements with a longer wavelength
will however be necessary to establish unambiguously the
actual phase coexistence limit in our sample.
2. PND at ﬁelds up to 9 T
Figures 6(d)–6(f) show the temperature dependence of the
same 2θ region shown in Figs. 6(a)–6(c) after applying a
magnetic ﬁeld of 9 T. At low temperatures (T < Tspiral) we still
observe an incommensurate modulation with q and magnetic
satellite intensities nearly identical to those observed at 0 T.
The only noticeable modiﬁcations with respect to the zero
ﬁeld data are slightly different temperature dependencies of
both q and the satellite’s integrated intensities, a decrease of
Tspiral, and a much larger temperature region where the spiral
and collinear phases coexist in sizable amounts. Using the

reﬂections measured at 0 (blue dots) and 9 T (red dots). (a) and (b) In

criterion described in the previous section, the lower boundary
of the phase coexistence region at 9 T will be ∼100 K, which
is again consistent with the value inferred from magnetometry.
We do not observe any signature of the ﬁeld-induced WFM
component, which would appear as an extra contribution to
the nuclear reﬂections in the NPD data. This is an expected
ﬁnding given that the observation of WFM requires a FC
process, and the NPD data were collected after cooling the
sample in zero ﬁeld. For data obtained after a FC process, the
small value of the net magnetization (3 × 10−4 μB/f.u. at 7 T),
far below the detection limit of the technique (∼0.1 μB), will
anyway prevent the observation of the WFM signal using the
NPD technique.
At higher temperatures (T > Tspiral) we note that the inte-
grated intensity of the (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) reﬂection takes values
signiﬁcantly lower than those observed in the absence on
magnetic ﬁeld. This is better appreciated in Fig. 7, showing
selected regions of the NPD patterns measured at 1.5 and
300 K under 0 and 9 T. In contrast to the magnetic ﬁeld
invariance of the reﬂections associated with the spiral phase
at 1.5 K, the ﬁgure reveals clear intensity differences in the
magnetic reﬂections associated with the commensurate prop-
agation vector kc at RT. More precisely, the intensity of the
(h + 1/2, k + 1/2, l + 1/2) reﬂections with l = 0 decreases,
and that of those with l ̸= 0 increases. This suggests the ex-
istence of a different magnetic phase at 9 T described by the
same propagation vector kc = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) observed in the
absence of magnetic ﬁeld.
The different impact of the magnetic ﬁeld in the spiral
and collinear phases is better appreciated in Fig. 8, showing
the ﬁeld dependence of the (1/2, 1/2, 1/2 ± q) and (1/2,
1/2, 1/2) reﬂections and their integrated intensities at sev-
eral temperatures between 1.5 and 300 K. We note that the
invariance of the incommensurate satellites for ﬁelds up to

FIG. 8. Contour maps showing the ﬁeld dependence of the magnetic Bragg reﬂection (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) associated with the high-temperature
collinear phase and the (1/2, 1/2, 1/2 ± q) satellites of the low-temperature magnetic spiral phase at selected temperatures together with the
ﬁeld dependence of their integrated intensities.
9 T observed at 1.5 K is preserved up to ∼140 K. Above this
temperature, and beyond a critical ﬁeld, modiﬁcations of the
magnetic reﬂections associated with the spiral phase become
evident. The 2θ positions of the incommensurate satellites
become closer, their intensities decrease, and the commensu-
rate reﬂection (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) suddenly appears. The impact
of magnetic ﬁeld on the spiral phase is thus similar to that
of temperature, with the spiral fully disappearing beyond a
critical ﬁeld H1(T ) that decreases by increasing temperature
and vanishes at ∼250 K. Phase coexistence is observed in a
temperature region that becomes narrower by approaching the
zero-ﬁeld Tspiral value, in agreement with the magnetization
results.
Between 250 and 300 K the propagation vector is com-
mensurate for any ﬁeld between 0 and 9 T. However, in
contrast with the behavior observed in the spiral phase, the
intensity of the (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) reﬂection decreases contin-
uously with H up to ∼2 T. Above this value it remains
constant up to the largest ﬁeld investigated. This behavior
conﬁrms the existence of a ﬁeld-induced, second-order transi-
tion at H2 ∼2 T, in agreement with the conclusion inferred
from the ﬁeld dependence of the isothermal magnetization
curves.
As mentioned before, a quantitative analysis of the inte-
grated intensities cannot be satisfactorily performed with the
present data. However, the ﬁeld dependence of the Bragg
reﬂections above 250 K can already give some hints on the
modiﬁcations of the zero-ﬁeld commensurate magnetic order
under the action of a magnetic ﬁeld. On one side, the preser-
vation of the commensurate propagation vector kc above and
below H2 ∼2 T demonstrates that the periodicity of the
low (COL1) and high-ﬁeld (COL2) magnetic arrangements
is identical. On the other, the COL1 and COL2 phases fea-
ture the same reﬂection set, albeit with different intensities.
Moreover, the small value of the critical ﬁeld (2 T) is in-
dicative of a low magnetic energy scale. According to DFT
calculations, the smallest nearest-neighbor (NN) couplings in
YBaCuFeO5 are those along the c axis [24]. Moreover, the
magnetic anisotropy energy is probably comparable in order
of magnitude [46]. Possible changes in the magnetic arrange-
ment compatible with these observations could thus include a
spin-ﬂop transition, or a change in the coupling schema along
023008-8

the c axis (as shown in [24], at least three different magnetic
conﬁgurations are consistent with kc = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) and
the observed reﬂection set). Due to the use of a ceramic
rod, it is extremely difﬁcult to interpret the response of the
magnetic intensities to an external magnetic ﬁeld shown in
Fig. 7 as a signature of one of these possibilities. However,
the large in-plane NN couplings in YBaCuFeO5 and the low
anisotropy of the collinear phase [47] led us to speculate
about the possibility of a spin-ﬂop transition. Such transitions
involve a change in the orientation of the antiferromagnetic
conﬁguration from parallel to transverse when the external
magnetic ﬁeld is applied along an easy antiferromagnetic di-
rection, and are observed in antiferromagnets with anisotropy
energies signiﬁcantly weaker than the exchange interactions.
In YBaCuFeO5 single crystals with Tspiral = 160 K, the
magnetization was reported to have an easy plane perpendic-
ular to the fourfold axis parallel to c at any temperature below
Tcollinear ∼440 K [47]. This is in agreement with Refs. [18,19],
where lower Tspiral values were found to result in inclined
spirals with the rotation plane closer to the crystallographic
ab plane. For small values of the magnetic anisotropy, a mag-
netic ﬁeld applied along a or b could thus induce a spin-ﬂop
transition and align the magnetic moments parallel to the c
axis. Interestingly, the anisotropy of the collinear phase was
found to be quite modest, whereas that of the spiral phase was
signiﬁcantly larger [47]. This could explain the stability of
the spiral under application of a magnetic ﬁeld, and supports
the observation of a spin-ﬂop transition only in the collinear
phase at a modest magnetic ﬁeld H2 = 2 T. This ﬁeld is indeed
much smaller than the extrapolated Hsat ∼1000 T, which
reﬂects the overall energy scale of the exchange couplings
in YBaCuFeO5. This, together with the smooth evolution
of the magnetic reﬂections for ﬁelds up to H2, makes the
spin-ﬂop scenario reasonably plausible. Magnetization and
neutron diffraction measurements on single crystals will be
nevertheless necessary to establish whether it is realized in
YBaCuFeO5.
C. Phase diagram
Based on the data presented in previous sections, we
can now establish the magnetic phase diagram for polycrys-
talline YBaCuFeO5 (Fig. 9). Phase lines constructed from
the maximum of the (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) reﬂection in the NPD
versus temperature data and the point where its integrated
intensity starts to deviate from linearity (black triangles), the
setup/anomaly at 2 T of this reﬂection in the NPD versus ﬁeld
data (white triangles), the limits of the hysteresis region in the
FCC-FCW curves (black circles), and the M(H) curves (white
circles) mark the boundaries of four different regions: an
incommensurate spiral phase with propagation vector ki and a
small WFM component, two different commensurate phases
COL1 and COL2 with identical propagation vector kc, and
a commensurate-incommensurate phase coexistence region
whose thermal stability increases with the applied ﬁeld. This
region, where hysteresis is observed as a function of both tem-
perature and magnetic ﬁeld, extends along the line separating
the incommensurate spiral phase from the two commensurate
phases COL1 and COL2. The two spiral →COL1 and spi-
ral →COL2 transitions in YBaCuFeO5 present thus some

magnetic phases are indicated in the legend.
characteristics typical from ﬁrst-order transitions in spite of
the smooth temperature and magnetic ﬁeld dependence of
the magnetic modulation vector q (Figs. 6 and 8). This un-
usual behavior, not reported for other high-temperature spiral
magnets such as CuO [44], could be a consequence of the
disorder-based mechanism at the origin of the spiral. Whereas
in CuO the magnetic frustration arises from the classical
competition between NN and NNN exchange interactions, the
spiral state in YBaCuFeO5 originates around a few, randomly
distributed Fe-Fe frustrating bonds, which induce a canting
of the Cu/Fe magnetic moments around them [27,28]. In
the collinear phase, such “impurity” bonds could play a role
similar to nucleation centers in ﬁrst-order transitions, which
grow at the expenses of the preexisting phase leading to the
phase coexistence and hysteresis characteristic of this kind of
transition. The COL1 →COL2 transition at 2 T displays in
contrast no hysteresis, as expected in a prototypical second-
order phase transition.
As shown in Fig. 9, the phase coexistence region broadens
for higher ﬁelds and lower temperatures. The ﬁeld dependence
of the spiral nucleation and growth rate at different tempera-
tures have not been investigated theoretically. However, we
can speculate that an external magnetic ﬁeld could modify the
canting angle distribution of the Fe/Cu magnetic moments
around the Fe-Fe impurities necessary for the spiral stabil-
ity [27,28]. The observation of an enlarged phase coexistence
region at higher magnetic ﬁelds and lower temperatures also
suggest that a decrease of the thermal ﬂuctuations may be
necessary for the spiral to become majoritary and ultimately
replace the collinear phase. Finding whether this is the case
will however require additional theoretical work. At a purely
experimental level, linear extrapolation of the phase coexis-
tence boundaries of the phase diagram suggests that, at base
temperature, the (pure) spiral + WFM and COL2 phases
could exist, respectively, for magnetic ﬁelds lower than ∼18–
20 T, and larger than 58–60 T. Magnetization and neutron

diffraction experiments will be however necessary to check
this prediction. These measurements will be also needed to ex-
plore the higher-ﬁeld part of the phase diagram, which, given
the large value of the estimated Hsat upper limit (∼1000 T) at
low temperatures, gives plenty of room to observe additional
ﬁeld-induced transitions.
D. Perspectives for spiral orientation and polarization
manipulation
An unexpected ﬁnding uncovered by the magnetic phase
diagram is the observation of a ﬁeld-driven transition only in
the collinear phase. In the yellow region of Fig. 9, our NPD
data did not reveal any signature suggesting a modiﬁcation of
the envolvent shape and/or orientation of the spiral, a priori
more prone to be destabilized by a magnetic ﬁeld. Interest-
ingly, a similar behavior has been observed in CuO, another
easy plane, high-temperature spiral multiferroic. As shown by
Wang et al. [44], the magnetic ﬁeld needed to suppress the
multiferroic spiral phase observed between 213 and 230 K is
temperature dependent and can reach values as high as 50 T. In
contrast, the collinear phase observed below 213 K undergoes
a spin-ﬂop transition at a much lower, temperature indepen-
dent ﬁeld (10.5 T). These ﬁndings have been explained as the
result of the ﬁne balance between the exchange interactions
and the anisotropy energies associated with the easy plane and
the hard axis. Since the last ones are temperature dependent
and differ by a factor of ∼36 at low temperatures, a change in
the orientation of the magnetic moments with respect to the
magnetic ﬁeld can substantially change the energy balance. A
similar scenario could also be pertinent for YBaCuFeO5, but
measurements of the anisotropy energy in single crystals and
information on the phase diagram along the different crystal
axes will be necessary to model the stability ranges of the
different magnetic phases.
Another intriguing observation inferred from our data is
the emergence of a WFM component only in the spiral phase
under the application of a magnetic ﬁeld. It is worth mention-
ing that ferromagnetism is symmetry forbidden (and indeed
not observed) for H = 0 [24]. However, its existence for H >
0 is unambiguously demonstrated by our magnetization and
AC susceptibility data. The origin of the WFM component is
unclear, but the fact that it is only observed in the spiral phase
suggests a common origin for both phenomena. A possible
scenario could be that the canting of the Cu/Fe magnetic
moments in the vicinity of a Fe-Fe impurity [27,28] is not
exactly compensated when an external magnetic ﬁeld is ap-
plied. Probing whether this is the case is out of the scope of
this study and will require additional theoretical work.
A third point needing further investigations concerns the
orientation of the WFM component with respect to the spiral
rotation plane, and whether both orientations are linked. This
is very important information because it could open the way
towards the manipulation the spiral orientation (and hence
the polarization direction). As shown in Fig. 3(d), the WFM
component can be switched with relatively modest ﬁelds
(∼0.7 T at 5 K), but only after a ﬁeld cooling process. If
the orientations of the WFM component and the spiral are
linked, it seems reasonable to expect that a magnetization
reversal after ﬁeld cooling could result also in a modiﬁcation

measurements under magnetic ﬁeld on single crystals will be
necessary to establish whether this is the case in YBaCuFeO5.
IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
To conclude, we report here a H-T phase diagram of poly-
crystalline YBaCuFeO5, a high-temperature spiral magnet,
and multiferroic candidate. Using magnetometry and neutron
powder diffraction at low temperatures (2–300 K) and high
magnetic ﬁelds (0–9 T) we reveal the existence of an in-
commensurate spiral phase, two collinear phases, and a broad
phase coexistence region separating the phases with commen-
surate and incommensurate magnetic orders.
Contrary to our initial expectations, we observe a ﬁeld-
induced transition in the high-temperature collinear phase at
H2 = 2 T without change of propagation vector. In contrast,
the spiral phase appears to be stable up to much higher ﬁelds
(in particular at low temperatures) when the sample is cooled
in zero ﬁeld. Another unexpected ﬁnding of our study is
the observation of weak ferromagnetism coexisting with the
spiral modulation. Moreover, the WFM component can be
switched by a modest magnetic ﬁeld if the sample is ﬁeld
cooled below Tspiral. Our data could not provide information
about the existence of a coupling between the orientation

of the spiral and the WFM component. However, given that
the last one appears exclusively in the spiral phase, it seems
reasonable to assume that some degree of coupling exists. If
this is the case, the tunability of the WFM component could
open the way to a magnetic ﬁeld-driven modiﬁcation of the
spiral orientation, directly related to the polarization direction.
Moreover, an electric ﬁeld acting on the polarization could
also modify the magnetization. This would open new perspec-
tives for a low-energy control of M and P, and the possible
use of YBaCuBaO5 in technological applications based on the
magnetoelectric effect.

the neutron diffraction proﬁles with three Gaussian functions
plus a linear background between 23◦⩽2θ ⩽32◦. The free
parameters were the 2θ positions and maximal intensities for
the three Gaussians, plus two additional parameters describing
a linear background. The ﬁts were performed in sequential
mode, starting from 1.5 K upwards. Because of the progres-
sive merging of the three reﬂections by approaching Tspiral,
the widths of the three reﬂections could not be reﬁned in-
dependently. Hence, we ﬁxed them to the values obtained
at temperatures as far as possible from Tspiral (1.5 K for the
spiral phase, 300 K for the collinear phase). This assumption
is most probably not valid close to the spiral ordering tem-
perature, where broader reﬂections are expected due to the
phase coexistence and hence smaller collinear/spiral diffrac-
tion domains. However, it was the only way to avoid the
divergence of the ﬁts by approaching Tspiral. Examples of the
ﬁts at selected temperatures for H = 0 and 9 T are presented
in Fig. 10, with the contributions of the three reﬂections to the
full proﬁle displayed in different colors.
2. Extended magnetization data
As a complement to Fig. 4, an extended set of magnetiza-
tion curves and their ﬁrst derivatives is presented in Figs. 11
and 12. Figure 11 shows the magnetic ﬁeld dependence of
the magnetization in YBaCuFeO5 at 20 different temperatures
between 20 and 300 K through a full M(H) hysteresis cy-
cle (−9 < H < +9 T). The ﬁrst derivative ∂M/∂H of these
curves is shown Fig. 12.
For temperatures between 20 and ∼140 K the magnetiza-
tion increases in an almost linear way with H. In contrast, a
pronounced nonlinear behavior accompanied by hysteresis is
clearly observed between ∼140 K and Tspiral. The presence of
hysteresis can be particularly well appreciated in the deriva-
tive curves of Fig. 12, where the anomaly associated with
the spiral to collinear transition appears as a sharp ﬁeld and
temperature-dependent maximum.
As shown in Fig. 11, the M(H) curves are also nonlinear
between Tspiral and 300 K. This can be better appreciated in
Fig. 12, where the ﬁrst derivative signals the presence of a
slope change at a temperature-independent ﬁeld H = 2 T. The
associated anomaly is less sharp than in the case of the spiral-
collinear transition and it does not show hysteresis, suggesting
the presence of a ﬁeld-induced transition of different nature.
This was further conﬁrmed by the ﬁeld-dependent PND mea-
surements, which identiﬁed the anomaly with a transition
between two different collinear phases COL1 and COL2 with
identical magnetic propagation vector.
