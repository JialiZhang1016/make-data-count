Abstract 
Background:  Colorectal cancer, one of the most common digestive tumors with high mortality and morbidity 
worldwide, currently lacks effective therapies available to improve the prognosis. This study was aimed to investigate 
the potency of Scutellarin against colorectal cancers, and explore the related mechanism via genomic and proteomic 
analysis.
Methods:  Cell counting kit-8 assay was employed to detect the viability of HCT-116 and RKO cell lines treated with 
Scutellarin. The apoptosis of HCT-116 and RKO cells after Scutellarin administration was determined by TUNEL staining 
and Caspase 3/7 activity. Cell cycle was detected by flow cytometry analysis. The wound healing and transwell inva‑
sion test detected the role of Scutellarin in migration and invasion of HCT-116 and RKO cells. Meanwhile, the energy 
metabolism and growth of tumor tissues in vivo at day 28 were observed by PET-CT after Scutellarin administration 
with 50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg into 4-week-old nude mice. Blood routine and liver functions were also 
detected to evaluate the side effect of Scutellarin. Furthermore, the disease and function classifications which the 
differentially expressed genes and proteins involved after Scutellarin treatment were determined by genomic and 
proteomic analysis respectively.
Results:  The Scutellarin inhibited the migration and increased apoptosis of HCT-116 and RKO cell lines. Besides, 
Scutellarin treatment substantially decreased the growth and volume of colorectal tumors in nude mice without side 
effects on the blood routine and liver function. The differentially expressed genes in RKO cells after Scutellarin admin‑
istration were mainly enriched in cell death and survival, organismal injury and abnormalities, and cancer. In addition, 
forty-seven upregulated and twenty-nine downregulated proteins were identified. Functional clustering analysis 
exhibited enriched biological processes, cellular components, molecular functions and related pathways of these 
proteins in cellular metabolic. Then protein–protein interactions analysis showed the regulatory relationship among 
these differentially expressed proteins.
Conclusions:  Taken together, the present findings revealed that Scutellarin exerted significant antitumor effect with 
no side effects in the blood and liver by regulating various important molecules in tumor proliferation, apoptosis and 
metastasis.

Background
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of 
cancer-related mortality and with high morbidity [1]. In 
2012, 1.4 million people worldwide were diagnosed with 
CRC and 6,93,900 died. [2]. CRC usually results from a 
combination of inherited susceptibility together with 
environmental factors [3]. Those whose first-degree

relatives were diagnosed with CRC had a high lifetime 
risk of developing CRC [4, 5]. Numerous treatments for 
CRC have been extensively studied and applied. Screen-
ing programs could conduce to stratifying those patients 
tending to relapse, and personalized approaches may be 
designed to enhance the survival rate of postoperative 
CRC (PCRC) patients [6, 7]. Surgical treatment is pri-
marily applied to 80% CRC patients without metastatic 
disease, but more than 40% patients in stage II or III may 
suffer from postoperative progression [8, 9]. In some 
cases with residual cancer, tumor size surged swiftly after 
operation [10]. Thus investigations for more effective 
therapies are of vital urgency.
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been 
employed in cancer treatment for a long time. In view 
of serious side effects caused by radiation therapy and 
chemotherapy, more attention has been paid to TCM 
for the prevention and treatment of cancers worldwide. 
TCM treatment is beneficial for cancer patients in terms 
of modulating immunity, enhancing efficacy, reducing 
adverse effects and abrogating drug resistance, which 
represents a promising complementary approach in CRC 
prevention and treatment [11, 12]. Scutellarin (SCU), 
extracted from the dried Erigeron, is an active ingredient 
of flavonoid glucoside [13] and has been proved to have 
anti-inflammatory, anti-virus, anti-fibrotic, and immune 
regulation effect [14, 15]. In recent years, SCU has been 
found to exert anti-tumor effects on cancer cells, such 
as breast carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma and renal car-
cinoma [16–18]. Uprising evidence has exhibited the 
potentials of SCU for colorectal cancer treatment indi-
cated by inhibiting angiogenesis, proliferation, invasion 
and metastasis of colorectal cancer cells, as well as induc-
ing apoptosis [19, 20]. However, these reports mainly 
elaborated the efficacy of SCU and its related mecha-
nisms from in vitro experiments verification. Herein, the 
anticancer activities of SCU in colorectal cancer were 
determined by in vitro and in vivo investigations, and on 
account for the complexity of cancer cells metastasis and 
our goal to successfully target it in cancer treatment, we 
attempted to analyze the preliminary molecular mecha-
nisms of SCU underlying its anti-cancer efficacy via 
genomic and proteomic analysis.
Materials and methods
Cell culture
HCT-116 [ATCC number: CCL-247] colorectal carci-
noma cell line and RKO [ATCC number: CRL-2577] 
colon carcinoma cell line, purchased from Kunming 
Institution of zoology, were cultured and derivatives 
were generated. The RKO cells were routinely grown in 
DMEM/High GLUCOSE (Hyclone, USA) containing 
10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS; Hyclone, USA) and 1% 
Penicillin–Streptomycin Solution (PSS, Hyclone, USA), 
while HCT 116 cells were cultured in RPMI Medium 
Modified (Hyclone, USA) containing 10% FBS and 1% 
PSS in accordance with the manufacture’s instruction. 
After being washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 
Hyclone, USA) one or two times, the cells were digested 
for 2 to 3 min with 0.25% Trypsin (1–2 ml; Gibco). Diges-
tion of RKO cells was ended by FBS-containing medium. 
Following centrifugation (1000  rpm for 8  min) and re-
suspension, cell suspension was collected and the cells 
were plated in 25T (3 ml) culture flasks at a density of 
4 × 105 cells/ml in an incubator. After 24 h (h), the super-
natants containing non-adherent cells were removed 
and fresh medium was added. The cells were passaged 
after growing approximately to 90% confluency. Sub-
sequently, the HCT-116 and RKO cells were cultivated 
for further analysis. The growth status of the cultured 
cells was observed under an inverted microscope (Leica, 
Germany).
SCU administration
Firstly, 150 mg SCU (LongJing Biotech, China) were dis-
solved by 1 ml DMSO into 150 mg/ml and then sterilized 
by filtration through a 0.22 μm filter. The drug was added 
to the previously cultured HCT-116 and RKO cells at a 
set concentration. Normal saline was added into control 
groups. In each group, cells were observed at 24 h, 48 h, 
72 h and 96 h respectively after drug administration to 
monitor the survival of cells (Additional file 1, 2, 3).
Cell Counting Kit‑8 (CCK‑8) Assay
The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of SCU 
administration in HCT-116 and RKO cells was evaluated 
using CCK-8 assays. HCT-116 and RKO cells were plated 
at a density of 3000 cells per well into 96-well plates in 
a total volume of 100 μl medium. Then SCU was added 
into the cells for incubation overnight. At 72 h after dos-
ing, CCK-8 assay was carried out to detect the cell via-
bility. At the end time, CCK-8 solution was added into 
each well (10 μl per well). Four hours later, optical den-
sity (OD) at 450 nm was measured via Thermo Scientific 
Microplate Reader (Multlskan GO, Thermo) to deter-
mine the cell proliferation/viability. All the procedures 
were performed in triplicate and repeated at least three 
times. The inhibition ratio of SCU was expressed as a 
percentage of the control treated with vehicle solutions.
Terminal‑deoxynucleoitidyl transferase mediated nick end 
labeling (TUNEL) staining
TUNEL staining was employed to detect the apoptosis of 
HCT-116 and RKO cells. Cells were fixed with 4% para-
formaldehyde for 20 min after washed three times with 
PBS for 5  min each time. Subsequently, being washed

three times with PBS again, cells were incubated with a 
mixture of 0.1% sodium citrate and 0.3% Triton X-100 
at 37 °C for 30 min. The TUNEL reaction mixture was 
prepared in the dark: enzyme solution and label solution 
in a ratio of 1:9 on ice (In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, 
TMR, Roche, USA). The specimens were then put into a 
dark box to incubate at 37 °C for 1 h, and DAPI contain-
ing anti-fluorescence quencher were added to stain the 
cells which were incubated for 1 min at room tempera-
ture. High-content cell imaging system was finally used 
for picture collection. Positive cells were counted by two 
researchers blinded to the experiment.
Flow cytometry analysis
The cell cycles of 1 × 106 HCT-116 and RKO cells in 
6-well plates were observed by flow cytometry using a 
cell cycle analysis kit (PI/RNase Staining Buffer Solu-
tion, BD, USA). Briefly, after SCU administration, cells 
were digested with 0.25% EDTA-free trypsin, followed 
by centrifugation for 5–10 min at 1000 rpm. After cells 
collection, cells were re-suspended once with 1× PBS 
and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5–10 min. For cell cycle 
assay, cells were fixed by pre-chilled 70% ethanol at 4 °C 
for 18 h. After centrifugation and washes with ethanol to 
remove ethanol, 500 μl 1× staining solution was added 
followed by incubating at RT in dark for 15 min. Analysis 
was performed using a FACSVerse laser flow cytometry 
analysis system (Becton–Dickinson USA).
Activity of Caspase3/7
Cultured RKO cells were inoculated with 96-well plates, 
drug-treated and cultured in a incubator with ­CO2 at 
37 °C for 3 days (d). The Caspase-Glo3/7 buffer and the 
Caspase-Glo3/7 lyophilized powder were placed at room 
temperature, and Caspase-Glo reaction solution was a 
mixture of 10  ml Caspase-Glo3/7 buffer and Caspase-
Glo3/7 substrate (Caspase-Glo® 3/7Assay, Promega, 
USA). Afterwards, 100 μl of Caspase-Glo reaction solu-
tion was added to each well and shaken on a plate shaker 
at 300–500 rpm for 30 min. After mixing, the cells were 
incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Cell status was 
observed under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, 
USA). Data were measured using a microplate reader 
(Tecan infinite, Switzerland).
Wound healing test
The wound healing test was performed to detect the 
migration rate of HCT-116 and RKO cells after SCU 
administration. Firstly, the number of cells was counted 
at RT and the cells were prepared into suspension. Then 
cell suspension was plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells 
per well in 6-well plates. Next, a linear scratch was per-
formed with a plastic 10 μl pipette tip on the 6-well plates 
to make sure that the width of the scratches is as equal 
as possible. Afterwards, PBS was used to wash the cell 
fragments from scratches. For HCT-116 cells, the images 
before drug administration at 0  h as well as after drug 
administration at 12 h and 36 h were captured via Multi-
functional automated inverted Fluorescence Microscopy 
(Nikon Eclipse Ti-S fluorescence microscope, Nikon). 
Meanwhile, for RKO cells, the images were captured after 
drug administration at 0 h, 8 h and 24 h. The transferred 
rate = (the average distance at 0 h − the average distance 
at × h)/(the average distance at 0 h) × 100%.
Transwell invasion assay
Transwell invasion assay was employed to investigate the 
invasion and migration ability of HCT-116 and RKO cells 
under SCU administration via transwell chamber. Firstly, 
transwell was placed in a new 24-well plate, and 100 μl of 
serum-free medium was added to the upper chamber in a 
37 °C incubator for 1 h. Cells were suspended in serum-
free medium with the specified concentration of drug at 
a seeding density of 1 × 105/well. After adding 100 μl of 
cell suspension to the upper chamber, 600 μl of 30% FBS 
medium was added to the lower chamber. In the inva-
sion test, 500 μl of serum-free medium was added to the 
upper and lower chambers and placed in a 37 °C incuba-
tor for 2 h to rehydrate the Matrigel matrix layer. After 
adding 500 μl of cell suspension to the upper chamber, 
750 μl of 30% FBS medium was added to the lower cham-
ber. Following incubation at 37  °C, non-migrating and 
non-invading cells in the chamber were removed with a 
cotton swab, then migrating and invading cells were fixed 
in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. After being washed 
with PBS, cells were stained with 600 μl 0.1% crystal vio-
let at RT for 20 min. Following extensive washing with 
deionized water for several times, the images were cap-
tured randomly for at least five fields of each membrane 
using a fluorescence microscope (DM4000 B, Leica). The 
number of migrating or invading cells was expressed as 
the average number of cells per microscopic field over 
five fields.
Animals and groups
Forty 4-week-old female nude mice weighing around 
18–22 g were provided by Kunming Medical University 
in SPF environment. Animal Experimental Department) 
housed in a specific pathogen-free (SPF) were randomly 
assigned into 5 groups: Control, 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), 
Scu-50  mg/kg, Scu-150  mg/kg and Scu-300  mg/kg 
groups. Animals in negative control group were injected 
with equivalent DMSO, animals in positive control 
group were injected with 5-FU, and animals in the other 
3 groups were implanted with RKO cell lines (50  mg/
kg SCU: 150  mg/kg SCU, and 300  mg/kg SCU). All

experimental protocols and animal handling procedures 
were approved by the Animal Care and Use committee of 
Kunming Medical University in Yunnan province, China 
and were consistent with the National Institutes of Health 
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
RKO cells injection and SCU administration in nude mice 
in vivo
To determine the influence of SCU on RKO cells in vivo, 
2E+7/mL RKO cells were subcutaneously implanted into 
the armpit of the right forelimb of 4-week-old female 
nude mice, and each animal was injected with 200  μl 
RKO cells. Then the tumor growth situation was inves-
tigated after injection for 5–7 days. When tumors grew 
to over 100  mm3, mice were arranged into 5 groups 
(control group, 5-FU group, 50  mg/kg, 150  mg/kg, and 
300 mg/kg SCU groups, 10 mice in each group). The drug 
was injected intraperitoneally every other day for a total 
of 21  days, Control groups were treated with equiva-
lent DMSO, and the mice injected with 5-FU were as 
positive control group. Experimental mice, 50  mg/kg, 
150  mg/kg and 300  mg/kg SCU was intraperitoneally 
injected into the mice individually every other day for 
a total of 21  days. The tumor dimensions were meas-
ured every 3 d using a digital caliper and the tumor 
volume was calculated using the following formula: 
V = π/6 × (Length) × (Width)2.
Positron emission tomography‑computed tomography 
(PET‑CT)
PET-CT was performed to investigate the glucose uptake 
in tumor in nude mice, demonstrated by SUV max. In 
detail, after injection of RKO cells for 28 days, rats were 
anesthetized with 0.7% pentobarbital sodium (10  μl/g) 
via intraperitoneal injection and fixed in the supine 
position in PET/CT scanning table (Discovery 690/
Elite, GE, USA). By the standard protocol of AW Vol-
ume Share 5 software for 20  min, the whole-body CT 
and PET data were acquired. The scanning parameters 
were set as follows: 120  kV voltage, 260  μA electricity, 
0.561 screw pitch, 0.5 s/cycle rotational speed, 3.75 mm 
thickness and interval, 512 × 512 for CT matrix and 
fov = 50 cm × 50 cm. Further, CT and PET images were 
transferred to AW Volume Share 5 workstation to obtain 
coronal, sagittal, cross-sectional and 3D images, as well 
as fusion images of CT and PET images. Ultimately, the 
PET/CT pictures were analyzed through two PET/CT 
reporters by double blind approach and the average value 
of SUVmax was confirmed through drawing the ROI of 
tumor.
Tissue harvest
After PET-CT protocol, the animals were sacrificed by 
cervical dislocation following an intraperitoneal injection 
of 2% pentobarbital sodium (10 μl/g). Then two vernier 
calipers were placed on the left and the top of the ani-
mals to observe the specific scales, and animal pictures 
were captured by a digital camera. Afterwards, the tumor 
tissues were removed and the blood was obtained imme-
diately for further analysis of aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), white blood cell 
(WBC), platelet (PLT) and concentration of hemoglobin 
(HGB). Besides, the tumors were arranged on the white-
board for picture capturing, and Vernier caliper was also 
used as a reference to read specific dimensions of tumors. 
Lastly, the tissues were stored at − 80 °C for further use.
Microarray analysis in RKO cells with SCU treatment
Affymetrix microarray analysis was performed by Key-
GEN BioTECH Shanghai (Shanghai, China) for a ‘whole 
genome expression profiling gene chip of cells’ test in 
RKO cells with SCU treatment (n = 4/group). Briefly, 
total RNA was analyzed by Agilent 2100 and GeneChip 
3′IVT Express Kit was used to prepare amplified RNA 
(aRNA). Following complementary DNA (cDNA) synthe-
sis, double-stranded DNA was synthetized as template. 
Subsequently, GeneChip 3′IVT Express Kit was used to 
perform reverse transcription to obtain biotin-labeled 
cDNA in vitro. The aRNA was purified and fragmented. 
Afterwards, the fragmented aRNA was hybridized to 
GeneChip. After hybridization, the GeneChip arrays 
were eluted and then stained on a GeneChip Fluidics Sta-
tion 450 followed by scanning on a GeneChip Scanner 
3000. The signals and data were acquired and Significant 
Analysis of Microarray software (SAM) was used to iden-
tify significantly differentially expressed genes between 
the SCU groups and the NC groups. Furthermore, the 
microarray data was analyzed with Ingenuity Pathway 
Analysis (IPA).
Proteomic analysis
Proteomic analysis was employed to investigate the pro-
teome changes in this study. Forty-eight hours follow-
ing SCU administration, RKO cells were collected with 
6 × 106 cells for each sample in SCU group (6 × 107 cells 
for each one in control group) and there were 4 samples 
for each group. Protein extraction, digestion, peptide 
labeling, peptide fractionation, phosphorylated peptides 
enrichment and mass spectrometer (MS) detection were 
conducted at Shanghai Luming Biotechnology Co., LTD 
(Shanghai, China) as described previously [21].

Statistical analysis
Results used for statistical difference were presented as 
the mean ± SD. For multiple group comparison, one-way 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s post hoc mul-
tiple comparisons were applied. And Student’s T test was 
used to analyze the data between two groups. In addition, 
nonlinear regression analysis was used to analyze IC50 of 
SCU in RKO and 116 cells. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis 
(IPA) was applied for the disease and functions analysis 
of differentially expressed genes. All statistical analysis 
was performed using SPSS 13.0 software (SPSS, Inc., Chi-
cago, IL, USA). Significant difference among groups was 
determined using Bonferroni‑corrected analysis of vari-
ance. p < 0.05 was considered to indicate a statistical sig-
nificant difference.
Results
The SCU tolerance of RKO and HCT‑116 cells
IC50 of RKO and HCT-116 was detected using CCK-8 
assay to determine the sensitivity of these two cell lines 
in response to SCU treatment. The IC50 of RKO and 
HCT-116 cells were 117.8 μM and 255.1 μM respectively 
(Fig. 1a, b). The cell number of RKO and HCT-116 cells 
showed decrease after being subjected to SCU treat-
ment for 24 h, 48 h, 72 h and 96 h compared to the con-
trol groups. Besides, the cellular viability of RKO and 
HCT-116 cells increased gradually as the culture time 
prolonged but it was always depressed with the presence 
of SCU in comparison to control group indicated by OD 
value at 450 nm, and statistical difference was shown at 
culturing 72 h and 96 h (Fig. 1c, d, p < 0.05). These results

indicated that SCU administration resulted in a reduc-
tion in the viability of HCT-116 and RKO cell lines.
SCU suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis 
of RKO and HCT‑116 cells
To further validate the cell viability of HCT-116 cells 
after SCU treatment, immunofluorescent staining for 
TUNEL staining was applied. As a result, the number of 
apoptotic positive HCT-116 cells significantly increased 
in IC20 group and IC50 group, especially in IC50 group 
compared to control group (Fig.  2a) and apoptosis 
rate of HCT-116 cells was markedly elevated follow-
ing SCU treatment with different doses, of which IC50 
was more effective than IC20 (Fig. 2b, p < 0.05). Besides, 
flow cytometry was employed to further analyze the 
cell cycle of HCT-116 and RKO cells treated with dif-
ferent concentrations of SCU (Fig. 2c, d). The outcomes 
revealed that in HCT-116 cells, the proportion of Freq 
G1 cells in the IC20 group in HCT-116 cells was signifi-
cantly increased,while Freq S was decreased. At the same 
time, this change was more significant in the IC50 group 
(Fig. 2e, p < 0.05). Moreover, in RKO cells, the proportion 
of Freq G2 cells in the IC50 group was reduced compared 
to the control group (Fig. 2f, p < 0.05). These results sug-
gested that SCU depressed the growth of HCT-116 and 
RKO cells, prompting apoptosis of HCT-116 and RKO 
cells, of which IC50 was more effective than IC20 in facil-
itating cells apoptosis. The pro-apoptotic effects of SCU 
was further verified by the decreased Caspase 3/7 activity 
in IC20 and IC50 group relative to that in control group 
(Fig. 2g, p < 0.05).
The migration of HCT‑116 and RKO cells was inhibited 
after SCU administration in vitro
The migration rate of HCT-116 and RKO cells was 
detected by wound healing assays. The results showed 
that the cell migration ability of HCT-116 and RKO cells 
were decreased after SCU treatment (Fig. 3a, c). As time 
prolonged, cell migration of the SCU-treated HCT-116 
cells was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner, and 
the migration rate was significantly decreased in IC20 
and IC50 groups at 36 h compared to the control group 
(Fig. 3a, b, p < 0.05). Similar to HCT-116 cells, cell migra-
tion of RKO cells after SCU treatment was obviously sup-
pressed and its migration rate was substantially reduced 
in IC50 group at 24 h (Fig. 3c, d, p < 0.05). All the find-
ings suggested that SCU administration could reduce the 
migration rate of tumor cells.
Cellular metastasis of HCT‑116 and RKO cells 
was attenuated after SCU administration
To assess the effect of SCU on CRC cell metastasis, HCT-
116 and RKO cells were planted in  vitro and transwell 
invasion assay was performed. As the results demon-
strated, the migration and invasion ability of RKO and 
HCT-116 cells were significantly decreased in a dose-
dependent manner (Fig.  4a, b). It was exhibited that 
migratory cells per field of RKO cells in IC50 group were 
significantly fewer than IC20 and control groups, and 
migration fold change in IC50 group was much smaller 
than IC20 and control groups (Fig. 4c, e, p < 0.05). Similar 
trend was shown in invasion cells per well of RKO cells 
and invasion fold change (Fig.  4d, f, p < 0.05). Further-
more, the migratory cells per field and migratory fold 
change of HCT-116 cells in IC50 group were notably 
reduced compared to IC20 and control groups (Fig. 4g, 
h, p < 0.05). All of these exhibited that SCU possessed the 
ability to depress the migration and invasion ability of 
CRC cells.
SCU treatment inhibited the tumor growth in nude mice 
in vivo
With the intent to investigate the effect of SCU on tumor 
growth, the RKO cells were injected into the nude mice, 
and different doses of SCU were tested for the treatment 
of tumor in nude mice in vivo. It was demonstrated that 
50 mg/kg, 150 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg SCU significantly 
decreased the tumor weight compared with control 
group (Fig.  5a, g, p < 0.05). Additionally, PET-CT was 
carried out to detect the glucose uptake of the tumor, 
quantified by SUV max. As a result, SCU administra-
tion induced a decreased glucose uptake in the tumor 
in a dose-dependent manner, of which 300 mg/kg SCU 
showed the lowest glucose uptake (Fig. 5b–e). Neverthe-
less, no significant difference was exhibited in ponderal 
growth (Fig. 5f). Further, the tumor volume was smaller 
after 5-FU treatment at 18 d than that of control group 
(p < 0.01), 150  mg/kg SCU administration obviously 
reduced the relative tumor volume at 18 days (p < 0.01), 
and 300 mg/kg SCU administration markedly decreased 
the tumor volume at 9, and 18 days compared with con-
trol group (Fig. 5h, p < 0.05).
Microarray analysis of differentially expressed genes 
in RKO cells after SCU administration
Blood routine and biochemistry examination were per-
formed to verify whether there were side effects after 
SCU administration. As the results showed, the concen-
tration of HGB, AST, ALT, WBC and PLT was detected 
after SCU administration, however, no significant 
changes were revealed among 50 mg/kg, 150 mg/kg and 
300 mg/kg SCU addition in HGB, AST, ALT, WBC and 
PLT concentration test (Fig.  6a–c). In order to investi-
gate the underlying mechanisms of SCU treatment for 
CRC, Microarray analysis was performed to provide 
insights into the disease and functional classifications

in which differentially expressed genes involved. It was 
demonstrated the differentially expressed genes were 
mainly enriched in these classifications including cell 
death and survival, cancer, organismal injury and abnor-
malities, gene expression, protein synthesis, free radical 
scavenging, renal and urological disease, cellular move-
ment, organismal survival, cellular development, cel-
lular growth and proliferation and cellular compromise 
(Fig. 6d). Additionally, the heat map of disease and func-
tions revealed that these three functions, cell death and 
survival, cancer, organismal injury and abnormalities 
were significantly suppressed by differentially expressed 
genes (Fig. 6e).
Functional clustering analysis of differentially expressed 
proteins in SCU‑administered RKO cells
By proteomic analysis of RKO cells in the NC group and 
SCU group, the Volcano plot exhibited differentially 
expressed proteins (DEPs), red for up-regulated proteins, 
green for down-regulated ones, and black for proteins 
without differential expression and further identified 
47 upregulated proteins and 29 downregulated proteins 
with significant difference (Fig.  7a, b). Additionally, the 
clustering analysis demonstrated the expression varia-
tion of each protein identified above in SCU and Control 
groups (Fig. 7c). Functional annotation of all the identi-
fied proteins was conducted based on the annotation 
information from the Gene Ontology (GO) database and 
the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) 
database (Fig.  7d). According to the enrichment factor, 
the top 10 biological processes was selected: the posi-
tive regulation of cellular metabolic, negative regulation 
of cellular process, positive regulation of nucleobase-
containing compound, positive regulation of macromol-
ecule metabolic, positive regulation of cellular process, 
interspecies interaction between organisms, positive 
regulation of nitrogen compound, viral process, negative 
regulation of biological process and cellular component 
organization or biogenesis. In accordance with enrich-
ment factor, the top 10 cell components were: nucleus,

Discussion
Here, we reported that SCU was capable of inhibiting the 
proliferation, invasion and migration, as well as inducing 
the apoptosis of HCT-116 and RKO cells by comprehen-
sive in vitro experiments. Additionally, experiments per-
formed in nude mice validated that SCU could reduce 
energy absorption and inhibit the growth of CRC with no 
side effects in the blood and liver system. Moreover, the 
underlying mechanisms of SCU’s efficacy on CRC were 
investigated in this study by applying genomic and prot-
eomic analysis, which could provide theoretical basis for 
the further clinical treatment for CRC.
CRC, with poor prognosis, has been considered a 
potentially deadly disease on account for its undefined 
metastasis in a majority of patients [22]. A large num-
ber of evidence showed that researchers’ attention has 
been drawn to TCM treatment as a result of few side 
effects and multi-component therapeutic functions [23]. 
SCU, previously reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory 
and anti-apoptotic properties and decreases blood pres-
sure in hypertensive rats [24], has been widely studied in 
the field of carcinoma, for example, Burkitt lymphoma 
[25], tongue carcinoma [26] and hepatocellular carci-
noma [27]. SCU was also demonstrated to be capable of 
inhibiting the proliferation and induce the apoptosis of 
cancerous cells. In our present study, TUNEL staining, 
and Caspase 3/7 activity, flow cytometry analysis, and 
the wound healing, transwell invasion assays revealed 
that SCU suppressed the proliferation, invasion as well 
as migration, and facilitated the apoptosis of HCT-116 
and RKO cells. Meanwhile, SCU exhibited abilities to 
decrease the energy absorption and the growth and vol-
ume of CRC tumor in nude mice reflected by PET-CT 
and in  vivo imaging. What’ more, it’s shown that SCU 
exert no significant adverse effect on weight gain in mice 
and blood serum biochemical indices. The present study 
has verified the possible anti-cancer drug for inhibition 
of tumor growth and migration in the nude mice model 
with CRC.
In this study, Affymetrix microarray analysis revealed 
the enrichment of differentially expressed genes in RKO 
cells after SCU administration in disease and functional 
classifications and the top 15 classifications were shown 
as follows: cell death and survival, cancer, organismal 
injury and abnormalities, gene expression, protein syn-
thesis, free radical scavenging, renal and urological dis-
ease, cellular movement, organismal survival, cellular 
development, cellular growth and proliferation and cel-
lular compromise. Among these disease and functions, 
organismal injury and abnormalities, cell death and sur-
vival, and cancer were prominently inhibited. As a preva-
lent natural medicine herb, SCU has been used to treat 
ischemia heart diseases, neurological disorders, hepatitis, 
inflammation and osteomyelitis [28], and exhibited 
potent effects in inhibiting the growth of colon cancer, 
tongue carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma [26, 29].
Through proteomic analysis, we further identified 47 
upregulated proteins and 29 downregulated proteins in 
the SCU-treated RKO cells, indicating the effect of SCU 
treatment in colorectal cancer was a multiple-gene regu-
lated process. As revealed by bioinformatics analysis, the 
functions of the differentially expressed proteins were 
involved in various biological processes, cellular compo-
nent and molecular function and mounting correlated 
signal pathways. Biological function analysis revealed that 
the identified proteins were mainly involved in the posi-
tive regulation of cellular metabolic, negative regulation 
of cellular process, positive regulation of nucleobase-con-
taining compound, positive regulation of macromolecule 
metabolic, positive regulation of cellular process, inter-
species interaction between organisms, positive regu-
lation of nitrogen compound, viral process, negative 
regulation of biological process and cellular component 
organization or biogenesis, suggesting that SCU may 
play an important role in negatively mediating cellular 
process of tumor cells but the further investigations are 
still required. SCU has been previously reported to pro-
duce many biological activities, including anti‑oxidative, 
anti‑inflammatory, cardioprotective effects, as well as 
effects against human immunodeficiency virus [30, 31]. 
Combined with our findings, the effects of SCU for the 
treatment of colorectal cancer were regulated by the 
interacting effects of various genes involved in the media-
tion of multiple systems.
Besides, the cellular analysis elucidated the differ-
entially expressed proteins were mainly contained in 
nucleus, nucleus part, membrane-enclosed lumen, intra-
cellular organelle lumen, nuclear lumen, nucleoplasm, 
intracellular organelle part, organelle part and intracel-
lular non-membrane-bounded organelle. In addition, 
molecular function analysis concealed that the differen-
tially expressed proteins mainly participated in protein 
binding, poly(A) RNA binding, RNA binding, structure-
specific DNA binding, binding, nucleic acid binding, 
chromatin binding, macromolecular complex binding, 
enzyme binding and double-stranded DNA binding. SCU 
could inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in 
colorectal cancer, accompanied by triggering G2/M phase 
cell cycle arrest [32]. It has also been demonstrated that 
SCU epigenetic could modulate DNA, including DNA 
promoter methylation and histone modification which 
caused varied expression paterns of miRNA [33]. Mean-
while, pathway enrichment analysis of the DEPs explored 
the changes of metabolic pathways. The top 6 Pathways 
were as follows: spliceosome, RNA transport, leishma-
niasis, insolital phosphate metabolism, DNA replication 
Page 14 of 15
Xiong et al. Chin Med           (2020) 15:28 
and B cell receptor signaling pathway were significantly 
enriched. Importantly, protein–protein interactions anal-
ysis uncovered significant interactions between spliceo-
some and downregulated proteins like PRPF38A, SF3B2 
and TRA2B, between RNA transport and downregulated 
protein–CLNS1A, between DNA replication and down-
regulated proteins, RFC1 and MCM2, between B cell 
receptor signaling pathway and downregulated protein 
BCL10 and JUN. Meanwhile, JUN was significantly inter-
acted with downregulated protein—SMARCC1.
Conclusions
Collectively, the findings of the present study identified 
that Scutellarin could present anticancer activities in 
colorectal cancer. The present study may provide a new 
therapeutic strategy for colorectal cancer and may pro-
vide data resource based on the genomic and proteomic 
analysis, therefore act as a guide for future basic research 
and clinical research.
