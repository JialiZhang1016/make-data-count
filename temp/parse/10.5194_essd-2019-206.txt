Abstract. We present the organization, structure, instrumentation, and measurements of the Northeast Corridor
greenhouse gas observation network. This network of tower-based in situ carbon dioxide and methane obser-
vation stations was established in 2015 with the goal of quantifying emissions of these gases in urban areas
in the northeastern United States. A speciﬁc focus of the network is the cities of Baltimore, MD, and Wash-
ington, DC, USA, with a high density of observation stations in these two urban areas. Additional observation
stations are scattered throughout the northeastern US, established to complement other existing urban and re-
gional networks and to investigate emissions throughout this complex region with a high population density and
multiple metropolitan areas. Data described in this paper are archived at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology and can be found at https://doi.org/10.18434/M32126 (Karion et al., 2019).

Introduction
As the population of cities grows globally due to trends
toward urbanization, so does their relative contribution to
global anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) budgets (Eden-
hofer et al., 2014; O’Neill et al., 2010). City govern-
ments are making commitments to reduce their emissions
of GHGs through various sustainability and efﬁciency mea-
sures and coordination with organizations like the C40 Cli-
mate Leadership Group (http://www.c40.org, last access:
23 March 2020), the Global Covenant of Mayors for Cli-
mate and Energy (https://www.globalcovenantofmayors.org,
last access: 23 March 2020), and others. These organizations
require individual cities to conform to certain standardized
mechanisms and practices for reporting their carbon emis-
sions. City governments rely on inventories compiled using
data on fuel use, energy usage, etc., to estimate their total
emissions and changes over time and to determine the ef-
ﬁcacy of various emissions mitigation policies. Analysis of
atmospheric measurements provides additional useful infor-
mation to such efforts, by conﬁrming inventory estimates
(Sargent et al., 2018; Lauvaux et al., 2016), detecting trends
(Mitchell et al., 2018), or estimating emissions that are not
well quantiﬁed using inventory methods, such as methane
emissions (McKain et al., 2015; Ren et al., 2018; Lamb et al.,
2016; Yadav et al., 2019). Several urban top-down measure-
ment efforts are underway in various cities that include net-
works of observations, often in situ CO2 and CH4 measure-
ments from rooftops or towers (Verhulst et al., 2017; Xueref-
Remy et al., 2018; Bares et al., 2019) or using other long-path
and remote sensing methods (Waxman et al., 2019; Hedelius
et al., 2018; Wong et al., 2016; Pillai et al., 2016).
The
National
Institute
of
Standards
and
Technol-
ogy (NIST) has partnered with other federal, private,
and academic institutions to establish three urban test
beds in the United States: the Indianapolis Flux Ex-
periment

//www.nist.gov/topics/northeast-corridor-urban-test-bed,
last access: 23 March 2020). The goals of the urban test
beds are to develop and reﬁne techniques for estimating
greenhouse gas emissions from cities and to understand the
uncertainty of emissions estimates at various spatial and
temporal scales (e.g., whole city annual emissions vs. 1 km
weekly emissions). Recent results from the longest-running
test bed, INFLUX, show that whole city emissions can
be estimated using three different methods to within 7 %
(Turnbull et al., 2019).
The Northeast Corridor (NEC) was established in 2015 as
the third NIST urban test bed. The goals for this project are
to demonstrate that top-down atmospheric emissions estima-
tion methods can be used in a domain that is complicated by
many upwind and nearby emissions sources in the form of
surrounding urban areas. The objective is to isolate the an-
thropogenic GHG emissions from urban areas along the US
East Coast from many confounding sources upwind (cities,
oil and gas development, coal mines, and power plants) and
from the large biological CO2 signal from the highly pro-
ductive forests nearby and within the cities. The presence of
highly vegetated areas such as urban parks, local agriculture,
and managed lawns is expected to dominate the CO2 signal
in summertime, as has been found in Boston, MA (Sargent et
al., 2018). The NEC project has a current focus on the urban
areas of Washington, DC, and Baltimore, MD, USA, with
existing plans to expand northward to cover the entire urban-
ized corridor of the northeastern US, including the cities of
Philadelphia and New York City, and eventually linking up
with existing measurement stations in Boston, MA (McKain
et al., 2015; Sargent et al., 2018).
The
NEC
project
includes
multiple
measurement
and analysis components. The backbone of the NEC
project is a network of in situ CO2 and CH4 obser-
vation
stations

focusing on wintertime observations of CO2, CH4, CO,
O3, SO2, and NO2 from instrumented aircraft (Ren et al.,
2018; Salmon et al., 2018; Lopez-Coto et al., 2020a). The
use of low-cost CO2 sensors is also being investigated
in Washington, DC, with work focusing on calibration
and determination of long-term stability of inexpensive
nondispersive infrared (NDIR) sensors with potential for
use in CO2 data assimilation techniques (Martin et al.,
2017). The NEC project also includes an extensive modeling
component. First, high-resolution meteorological modeling
(using the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model)
is being conducted (Lopez-Coto et al., 2020b), with output
coupled to Lagrangian dispersion models such as STILT
(Lin et al., 2003; Nehrkorn et al., 2010) and HYSPLIT (Stein
et al., 2015). These transport and dispersion models are
used to interpret observations from both aircraft and tower
stations and in atmospheric inverse analyses to estimate
ﬂuxes of CO2 and CH4 from the cities of Washington, DC,
and Baltimore, MD (Lopez-Coto et al., 2020a; Huang et al.,
2019). A high-resolution fossil fuel CO2 inventory, Hestia,
is also being developed for this project (Gurney et al., 2012,
2019).
Here we focus on the high-accuracy tower observation net-
work and associated data collection and processing methods.
Section 2 describes the tower network design and character-
izes the different site locations; Sect. 3 describes the mea-
surement methods, instrumentation, and calibration; Sect. 4
presents the uncertainty derivation for the measurements;
and, ﬁnally, Sect. 5 presents some of the observations from
the current record.

Network design and site characterization
The NEC project includes 29 observation stations, all man-
aged and operated by Earth Networks, Inc.1 (http://www.
earthnetworks.com/why-us/networks/greenhouse-gas,
last
access: 23 March 2020). A total of 10 stations were existing
Earth Networks (EN) measurement sites in the northeastern
US that became part of the NEC project in 2015. A total of 19
stations were established (or will be established) speciﬁcally
for the NEC project, with site locations identiﬁed by NIST.
A total of 16 of these station locations were chosen to be
used for emissions estimation in a domain around Baltimore
and Washington, DC (red boundary, Fig. 1), using inverse
modeling techniques (Lopez-Coto et al., 2017; Mueller et
al., 2018). Three others are in Mashpee, MA, Philadelphia,
PA, and Waterford Works, NJ. As of publication, 14 of
these 19 have been established, with delays occurring due to
difﬁculty ﬁnding suitable tower locations to agree to house
the systems. The hardware and software operating at all the
sites is identical with few exceptions as noted in the text.
The initial design of the core urban Baltimore–Washington
network was focused on optimizing tower site locations with
the goal of reducing uncertainty in estimating anthropogenic
CO2 emissions from Washington, DC, and Baltimore using
an atmospheric inversion model (Lopez-Coto et al., 2017).
A total of 12 communications towers were identiﬁed as part

of that study as ideal locations for measurements. Actual
measurement sites were sometimes established at locations
near the ideal study location, usually due to logistical dif-
ﬁculties obtaining leases at the ideal tower sites. A second
design study determined ideal locations for background sta-
tions, i.e., observation station locations that would aid in the
determination of background CO2 entering the analysis do-
main (Mueller et al., 2018). Four stations were identiﬁed as
part of that study; an existing EN site in Bucktown, MD,
serves as a ﬁfth background station southeast of the analysis
domain (Fig. 1). Although inlet heights were desired to be
100 m above ground level (a.g.l.), often shorter towers were
used due to the lack of availability of tall towers in ideal lo-
cations; the shortest tower in this network has the uppermost
inlet at 38 m a.g.l. (HRD). Table 1 indicates details and loca-
tions of each site.
The stations in Table 1 are all situated in areas with dif-
ferent land use. Even among the Washington, DC, and Bal-
timore area urban stations, the degree of urban intensity
varies, from densely urbanized areas (such as northeastern
Baltimore, NEB) to dense and moderately developed sub-
urbs (such as Capitol Heights, CPH, and Derwood, DER,
both suburbs of Washington, DC, located in Maryland). Fig-
ure 2 indicates the intensity of development from the US Ge-
ological Survey (USGS) 2016 National Land Cover Database
(Yang et al., 2018) surrounding each urban station in the
Washington, DC, and Baltimore network.
Similar variability in land cover for the regional stations
exists, as indicated in Fig. 3. The sites established to charac-
terize background conditions for the urban network in Wash-
ington, DC, and Baltimore (SFD, TMD, BUC) are in areas
with little development: SFD and TMD are both in forested
regions, while BUC is near the Chesapeake Bay and large
wetland areas. The other regional sites span a range of land
cover types from urban (MNY in New York City and RIC

Land Cover Database (NLCD); Yang et al., 2018) within 5 km of

Instrumentation
The instrumentation contained in the Earth Networks (EN)
system module has been described elsewhere (Welp et al.,
2013; Verhulst et al., 2017); we will summarize the system
here but refer the reader to those publications for further de-
tails, including additional equipment and part numbers. Fig-
ure 4 indicates the plumbing diagram of the typical tower
setup. Three inlet lines reach from the sampling location on
the tower into the equipment housed in a full-size rack inside
a shed at the base of the tower. Typically, two inlet lines sam-
ple from the topmost level and one line samples from a lower

level on the tower. Stafford, VA (SFD), is one exception with
inlets at three different levels (50, 100, and 152 m), and a
planned tower in New Jersey (Waterford Works) will have
ﬁve inlet height levels, as indicated in Table 1. At some sites
there was no space to house the equipment in existing struc-
tures, thus small single- or double-rack sized enclosures were
purchased and installed. Air is pulled through a ﬁlter into
the inlet lines (0.953 cm, i.e., 0.375 in., OD Synﬂex 1300)
that are continuously ﬂushed at ∼10 L min−1 by aquarium
pumps (Alita AL-6SA). The three air lines are connected to
a rotary multi-port valve (MPV; eight-port, VICI, Valco In-
struments Co. Inc.) housed within a sample control box (cali-
bration box). Two or three calibration standards are also con-
nected to the MPV with 0.156 cm (0.0625 in.) OD stainless
steel tubing. The control system for the MPV directs the air
stream to the analyzer cycling every 20 min through each of
the three inlet lines so that each inlet is sampled at least once
an hour and every 22 h through each standard (Sect. 3.2).
The common port of the MPV is connected to a pressure
controller that reduces the pressure to 80 kPa (800 mb), after
which the sample (either ambient air or air from a standard
gas cylinder) enters a 183 cm long Naﬁon dryer (Permapure,
Inc., model MD-050-72S-1), where it is dried to a water va-
por mole fraction of ∼0.1 % prior to ﬂowing through the
cavity ring-down spectroscopic (CRDS) analyzer (Picarro,
Inc., Model 2301). The lower-than-ambient inlet pressure of
80 kPa is prescribed in order to lower the ﬂow rate of the ana-
lyzer to ∼70 standard cm3 min−1. At Mashpee, MA (MSH),
a CRDS Picarro Model 2401 analyzer is operational, and this
is the only site currently also measuring carbon monoxide
(CO) in addition to CO2 and CH4. The CRDS analyzers re-
port measurements of dry air mole fraction of each gas in
air, also known as the mole fraction, i.e., moles of the trace
gas per mole of dry air. Throughout, we refer to these mea-
surements in units of µmolmol−1 for CO2 and nmol mol−1
for CH4 and CO, following the SI recommendations (Bureau
International des Poids et Mesures, 2019). Software (GCW-
erks, Inc.) installed on a separate mini-PC at each site con-
trols the run cycle and the MPV selection valve. The data are
collected on this computer and sent to the central EN data
server, also running GCWerks. All data are processed on the
central EN data server but additional post-processing and un-
certainty assignment to hourly observations is performed at
NIST. As recommended by the World Meteorological Orga-
nization (WMO), the software has the capability of repro-
cessing all the data from the original raw ﬁles and thus can
accommodate any changes to the assigned values of the stan-
dards (due to a reference-scale update, for example) at any
time (WMO, 2018).
3.2
Calibration cylinders
When the Earth Networks GHG monitoring system was es-
tablished in 2011, each site hosted two calibration cylin-
ders (standards) with ambient level dry air mole fractions
as part of the original system design. This continues to be
the case at most NEC sites. At the NEC sites, these stan-
dards have values close to 400 µmolmol−1 dry air CO2,
1890 nmol mol−1 dry air CH4, and 115 nmol mol−1 dry air
CO (at MSH only) and are sampled by the analyzer period-
ically, in a sequence identical to that described for the Los
Angeles Megacity network by Verhulst et al. (2017). The
standards are purchased from the WMO Central Calibration
Laboratory (CCL), the National Oceanographic and Atmo-
spheric Administration’s Earth System Research Laboratory
(NOAA/ESRL) Global Monitoring Division in Boulder, CO,
USA, where they have been calibrated on the WMO scales
(X2007 for CO2, X2004A for CH4, and X2014A for CO,
Zhao et al., 1997; Dlugokencky et al., 2005; Novelli et al.,
2003). One of these two cylinders serves as a standard for
calibration and drift-correction, while the second serves as
a target tank or check standard. The target tank is used for
data quality checks and uncertainty calculations (Sect. 4).
The residual of the target tank (the rms difference between its
value assignment when treated as an unknown and its refer-
ence value from NOAA) is a critical indicator of data quality
and is monitored in order to alert the operators of any gen-
eral problems in the system such as leaks, mistakes in the
assignment of MPV ports, or drift in calibration tank value.
In the ﬁeld, all gas standards are sampled for 20 min every
22 h. In data processing, the ﬁrst 10 min of any tank run are
ﬁltered out to allow for the system equilibration, including
ﬂushing of the regulator and tubing. In some cases, when the
standard runs were found not to equilibrate as quickly as de-
sired, 15 min of data were ﬁltered until the problem could
be ﬁxed (typically either contamination or inadequate reg-
ulator ﬂushing). The ﬁrst 10 min of the ambient air sample
following a standard run are also ﬁltered for equilibration,
and the ﬁrst 1 min of each 20 min ambient air run is ﬁltered
if it follows another ambient air run (i.e., an inlet switch). The
longer ﬂush time is desired for the standard runs because of
the need to ﬂush stagnant air remaining in the regulators and
tubing when sampling from the cylinder, while the ambient
air lines are continuously ﬂushed.
At a few NEC sites (currently BWD and MSH, with more
planned), a third gas cylinder is installed at the site to serve
as a permanent high-concentration standard (referred to as
the high standard), to improve calibration and reduce un-
certainties. This standard typically contains air with a mole
fraction of CO2 close to 500 µmolmol−1, CH4 at approx-
imately 2300 to 2500 nmol mol−1 and at MSH, CO, near
320 nmol mol−1. At MSH, this cylinder has been provided
directly by NOAA/ESRL, while at BWD this cylinder was
purchased as natural whole air from Scott-Marrin, Inc. (now
Praxair). The Scott-Marrin air is stripped of its original trace
gases (CO2, CH4, CO, hydrocarbons, etc.) with CO2, CH4,
and CO added back in to prescribed values. Several such
standards have been purchased with the intent of placing
them at urban stations to serve as high standards after cal-
ibrating them onto the WMO scales. We note that because

they are being used together with NOAA/ESRL standards in
the ﬁeld, it is essential that these standards also be assigned
values on the same scales. This calibration is transferred in
the NIST laboratory using ﬁve standards calibrated and pur-
chased from NOAA/ESRL. The CO2 in the Scott-Marrin
cylinders is isotopically different (in terms of the 12C/13C
ratio in CO2) from the ambient air tanks that are ﬁlled by
NOAA/ESRL at Niwot Ridge, CO. However, the calibration
is transferred from the NOAA standards to the Scott-Marrin
gases using the same model (Picarro 2301) analyzer used in
the ﬁeld (i.e., measuring only 12CO2) in the NIST labora-
tory, effectively canceling out the error that would be caused
by this isotopic mismatch (Chen et al., 2010; Santoni et al.,
2014). Thus, the CO2 values assigned by NIST to these stan-
dards are effectively the total dry air mole fraction of CO2
the cylinders would contain if they were isotopically similar
to the NOAA cylinders.
Additional sites in the network also beneﬁt from the im-
proved two-point calibration method in cases where mea-
surements of a high standard were performed prior to ana-
lyzer deployment (NWB, NEB, JES, TMD, CPH, and HRD).
Prior to system installation at these sites, tests were con-
ducted at the EN laboratory in which the designated analyzer
was set up measuring the calibration standard, target stan-
dard, and a high-value standard at ∼490 µmolmol−1 CO2
and ∼2560 nmol mol−1 CH4 daily for several days (enough
for 3–5 measurements of 20 min each). This single high-
standard cylinder was also calibrated by and purchased from
NOAA/ESRL, with assigned values on the WMO scales.
These laboratory tests allow the determination of the sec-
ondary correction to the instrument response or sensitivity,
as described in Sect. 3.4.
The high-standard gas measurements are used to perform
a secondary correction (referred to as a two-point calibration)
(Sect. 3.4) to the original one-point calibration described by
Verhulst et al. (2017) and in Sect. 3.3., reducing the uncer-
tainty of the measurements. We note that while, in principle,
a secondary correction is desirable, and the uncertainty is in-
deed reduced by its implementation (see Sect. 4.2), it remains
quite small relative to the signals of interest in an urban net-
work. Deployment of high standards at all sites has not yet
occurred due to both costs and logistical and operational con-
straints; for example, at many sites the space available for
the equipment is limited and prohibits the installation of a
permanent third tank. Thus, we plan to implement a round-
robin procedure circulating additional standards at various
values through the network to evaluate the calibrations and
implement the secondary correction throughout the network.
Although the current state of having two different calibration
methods coexisting in the network is not ideal, we aim to im-
plement the secondary correction throughout the network as
soon as possible.

3.3
Drift correction and single-point calibration
Here we describe the calibration and drift correction applied
to all the mole fraction data. This single-point calibration
uses only a single reference value, that of the calibration
standard, to correct the raw mole fractions for each gas. The
equations are identical (with a few nomenclature differences)
to those found in Verhulst et al. (2017). In the following anal-
ysis, X′ denotes a raw dry mole fraction measurement (i.e.,
a reported value from the CRDS analyzer after internal wa-
ter vapor correction), while X denotes a mole fraction after
some correction has been applied (drift and/or calibration,
as described in the equations below). A subscript cal indi-
cates the main calibration standard (usually a single ambient
level standard tank calibrated by NOAA/ESRL), subscript
std indicates any other standard tank, tgt indicates a standard
tank that is being used as a target, and the subscript air in-
dicates the sample measurement. Note that within the GCW-
erks software, the meanings of the abbreviations cal and std
are reversed from what is deﬁned here; we choose to use
the nomenclature by Verhulst et al. (2017) here for consis-
tency with the literature. We note that we have changed some
nomenclature slightly from Verhulst et al. (2017) for addi-
tional clarity and conciseness. We refer to the drift-corrected
mole fraction as XDC, which is noted as Xcorr by Verhulst
et al. (2017); we refer to the mole fraction after a secondary
correction is applied as XSC. We also refer to the assigned
mole fraction of a standard by the calibration laboratory as
C rather than Xassign. We deﬁne the sensitivity S to be the
response of the analyzer or the ratio of the measured to the
true value. In the case of the calibration tank, this is the ratio
of the raw measured value, X′
cal, to the assigned value of the
standard by the calibration laboratory on the WMO scale for
the given species, Ccal:
S = X′
cal
Ccal
.
(1)
When only a single calibration standard is present (which is
the case at most sites in the NEC network), this sensitivity is
assumed to be constant across mole fractions but varying in
time. The sensitivity for the calibration tank is thus interpo-
lated in time and applied as a correction for the dry air mole
fractions of CO2 and CH4 reported by the CRDS analyzer
(X′
air):
XDC,air = X′
air
S ,
(2)
where XDC,air is the drift-corrected air data. An alternative
drift-correction is to use an additive offset, which is also in-
terpolated in time, rather than a sensitivity for drift correc-
tion:
XDC,air = X′
air +
 Ccal −X′
cal

.
(3)
Measurements from MSH that include a high-value cylinder
suggest that the single-tank drift correction performs (very
slightly) better using the ratio correction (Eq. 2) than the dif-
ference method (Eq. 3) for CO2 and CH4, while the opposite
is true for CO (Fig. 5), thus the difference method is used
only for CO in our network.
The calibration standard mole fractions are interpolated in
time between subsequent runs in order to apply the above
corrections to the air data, thus removing drift in the instru-
ment’s response. This drift-corrected fraction is reported in
the hourly data ﬁles for sites and time periods where no range
of concentrations is available in the standard tanks.
3.4
Multiple-point calibration
At some sites and for some time periods, a higher-mole-
fraction standard is available, and a second-order correction
can be made to the instrument sensitivity, accounting for the
sensitivity being a function of mole fraction. Usually in the
ﬁeld, this correction employs only one additional standard,
the higher-mole-fraction standard so that it is a two-point cal-
ibration; here we describe the general procedure for applying
a correction using multiple standards at a range of concen-
trations. This is applied as a second-order correction to the
drift-corrected air data. In general, if a range of standard con-
centrations is available, the correction in GCWerks is applied
as described below. First, a drift-corrected sensitivity (SDC)
is calculated for each standard when it is measured, which is
the ratio of the drift-corrected mole fraction of that standard
(XDC,std, based on Eq. 2 for CO2 and CH4 or Eq. 3 for CO)
to its assigned value:
SDC,std = XDC,std
Cstd
.
(4)
For the calibration standard, this value is necessarily equal
to 1, but measurements of standard tanks with different as-
signed values indicate that the instrument sensitivity is de-
pendent on the composition of the sample gas (in this case,
the mole fraction of the standard tank). In laboratory calibra-
tions, we ﬁnd that the drift-corrected sensitivity deﬁned in
Eq. (4) is a linear function of the mole fraction ratio to the
calibration gas (X′/X′
cal), thus we use a linear ﬁt to the range
of standards to determine the slope m and intercept b:
SDC = m
 X′
X′
cal

+ b.
(5)
In this ﬁt, we force m + b = 1 by ﬁtting a slope m and then
setting b = 1 −m in order to maintain the proper relation-
ship for the calibration tank itself, when SDC,cal = 1. Apply-
ing this ﬁt to the air data, the ﬁnal air mole fraction XSC,air is
determined from
XSC,air =
XDC,air
SDC

In the NEC tower network, there are no sites with multi-
ple standard tanks at various concentrations. At several sites,

Figure 5. Time series of standard tank run residuals (i.e., XDC −C) for CO2 (a, b), CH4 (c, d), and CO (e, f). XDC is calculated using
a single calibration tank (not shown) and the ratio method (Eq. 2) on the left (a, c, e) and the difference method (Eq. 3) on the right (b,
d, f). Assigned tank values are shown in the legend; one tank was not calibrated for CO so only the residuals of the high-concentration
tank at 315 nmol mol−1 are shown. The residual magnitude is smaller for CO2 and CH4 using the ratio method, but the standard deviations
(variability) are similar using both methods. For CO, both the magnitude of the residual and the standard deviation are smaller using the
difference equation; the ratio equation does not properly account for the drift in the analyzer at the start of the time series (May–June). Data
shown are from MSH; a measurement gap exists in July.
there are measurements of a single high-concentration stan-
dard (hstd) in addition to the calibration and target standards.
The high-standard measurements are either performed in the
laboratory before the instrument is deployed to the ﬁeld,
or in the ﬁeld if the third standard is permanently installed
(Sect. 3.2). The above secondary correction is applied us-
ing only two tanks to perform the ﬁt and obtain the drift-
corrected sensitivity. In this special case, the ﬁt has zero de-
grees of freedom with no residuals. The correction parame-
ters (slope and intercept) are determined based on measure-
ments over time or single measurements in the laboratory
prior to a speciﬁc analyzer deployment. The correction is ap-
plied to the data from the site for a time period that is speci-
ﬁed, i.e., it is not automatically applied based on daily mea-
surements of the high standard. It is determined by the sci-
ence team and applied for the time period that is appropriate.
This is necessary to avoid applying the wrong correction if an
analyzer is replaced or if there are changes made to the ana-
lyzer that might affect its calibration response. At eight sites
where a high standard has been measured at any point (MSH,
BWD, NWB, NEB, JES, TMD, CPH, and HRD), slopes and
intercepts have been determined and the correction has been
applied to the data. At stations with no high-standard mea-
surements, we rely on the single-tank drift-correction de-
scribed in Sect. 3.3.
Laboratory tests with multiple standards with the same
model instrument used in the network (Picarro 2301) were
performed to assess the relative improvement of a ﬁt to two
standards over a ﬁt to a single standard. Figure 6a illustrates
the ﬁt of the drift-corrected sensitivity (SDC) to two standards
(red line) vs. all ﬁve standards (blue line) for CO2, along with
corresponding residuals in Fig. 6b. As was shown by Verhulst
et al. (2017) for multiple analyzers, the ﬁt to a single standard
has a linearly varying residual that is typically 0.1 to 0.2 at
100 µmolmol−1 above the calibration standard value (green
circles, Fig. 6b). The average slope of the one-point residual
from multiple tests is used by Verhulst et al. (2017) to esti-
mate the uncertainty of the single-point calibrations (called
the extrapolation uncertainty, Uextrap), described in Sect. 4.1.
Performing the additional correction using a high standard
shows improvement in the residuals of the ﬁt (Fig. 6b), while
using all ﬁve standards only improves the residuals incre-
mentally. The two-point correction (red) in this ﬁgure was
applied using the 406 µmolmol−1 tank as the calibration and

the 496 µmol mol−1 tank as the high standard; thus, the mea-
surement at ∼711 µmolmol−1 is an extrapolation of the two-
point ﬁt. The residuals at values between the calibration and
high standard are very small, equal to or below the uncer-
tainty (reproducibility) of the scale reported by NOAA; this
was conﬁrmed for other analyzers and other species.
The improvement in calibration from the secondary cor-
rection is quite small compared to the signals and gradients
of interest in our network. For example, when considering
the enhancement between the rural site TMD and a polluted
urban site, HRD, the calibration method makes a median dif-
ference of 0.4 % for CO2 and 0.3 % for CH4 (over all hours
over 1 calendar year). We intend to implement this calibra-
tion throughout the network through deployment of addi-
tional standards and periodic traveling calibrations when per-
manent installation is not practical for logistical reasons.

Data quality and processing
Automated data ﬁltering is performed within the GCWerks
software with parameters set identically to those extensively
described by Verhulst et al. (2017) for the Los Angeles
Megacities network. For example, individual measurements
that are outside limits for cavity temperature, cavity pres-
sure, and during transitions between sample streams are ﬁl-
tered. The data are automatically downloaded from each
site’s Linux PC to the central EN Linux server, where they
are processed automatically every hour. We note that all mole
fraction assignments can be recalculated by the GCWerks
software from the archived raw ﬁles if required due to a
change in ﬁltering or ﬂagging, or in assignment of a stan-
dard tank, for example, in the case of a scale change by the
CCL. The data ﬁles exported from GCWerks contain 1, 5,
and 20 min averaged air data, as well as separate ﬁles with
1, 5, and 20 min averages of all standard runs. Individual or
groups of 1 min data points are ﬂagged manually by EN or
NIST researchers in the GCWerks if there is cause (e.g., a
site visit that disrupted the sample stream or a leak in the
line). Some additional quality checking is performed at this
stage, speciﬁcally checking for systematic differences be-
tween measurements from two different inlets at the same
height and checking for inconsistencies in the difference be-
tween measurements at different heights. For example, if the
lower inlet is systematically reading lower CO2 than the up-
per inlet, especially at night, it would indicate that the in-
let lines may be switched (mislabeled) or there is a leak oc-
curring. These indications would be then veriﬁed by a ﬁeld
technician, and the data are either reprocessed or ﬂagged ac-
cordingly. Filtered and ﬂagged points are excluded from the
subsequent averaging exported by GCWerks. The 1 min air
data ﬁles and 20 min standard data ﬁles are post-processed at
NIST to calculate hourly averages from each air inlet level
and to assign uncertainties to each hourly average (Sect. 4).
Data from the two top-level inlets, when they are at the same
height, are combined for inclusion into the hourly average.
Thus, because of the 20 min cycling through the three in-
lets (Sect. 3.1), hourly averages at the upper inlet include ap-
proximately 40 min of measurements, and for the lower inlet
only 20 min (fewer if a calibration occurs). Publicly released
hourly data from this second-level processing are contained
in separate ﬁles for each species and each level for each site.
The ﬁles contain the hourly average mole fraction (i.e., mole
fraction) along with its uncertainty, standard deviation, and
number of 1 min air measurements included in that particu-
lar hourly average. These last two quantities are provided so
users can determine the standard error of the hourly means in
terms of the observed atmospheric variability within the hour.

Comparison with measurements of NOAA whole air
samples
Ongoing whole air sampling in ﬂasks at several of the NEC
sites by NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory’s Global
Monitoring Division (NOAA/GMD) provides a check on the
quality of the in situ measurements. The ﬂasks are analyzed
for CO2, CH4, and CO, among a suite of additional trace
gases and isotopes that are not discussed here. The ﬂask-
sampling equipment draws air from one of the inlet lines
at the top of the tower that is also shared by the continu-
ous in situ measurement equipment (as indicated by the ﬂask
port in Fig. 4). The ﬂask measurements are otherwise in-
dependent from the continuous in situ measurements. Flask
samples at LEW and MSH are collected over a period of
10–30 s (Sweeney et al., 2015; Andrews et al., 2014), while
ﬂask samples integrated over 1 h are collected at TMD, NEB,
NWB, and BWD (Turnbull et al., 2012) speciﬁcally as part of
the Northeast Corridor project. All ﬂask samples are taken in
midafternoon local time (usually 19:00 UTC). Comparisons
at all the sites with available data indicate good agreement
with little or no bias in the mean over the time period of the
comparison, with the exception of CO at MSH, which shows
a consistent bias with a median of 8 nmol mol−1, which is
larger than the 1σ uncertainty assigned to either measure-
ment (described in Sect. 4) and the standard deviation of
the offsets themselves (Table 2). Target tank residuals for
CO in this period range from 1 to 7 nmol mol−1, depend-
ing on the cylinders installed, indicating that at least some
of this difference is caused by the calibration standard as-
signed value (possibly due to cylinder drift in time between
the NOAA calibration and deployment to the site). Simi-
lar differences between NOAA ﬂasks and in situ CO mea-
surements were reported in Indianapolis (Richardson et al.,
2017). This result requires further investigation, by send-
ing the cylinders for recalibration and/or deploying different
standards to the station. A signiﬁcant bias in the CH4 off-
set at NWB is also apparent, at a mean of −5.5 nmol mol−1
but a median of −1.7 nmol mol−1, the result of a single out-
lier at −30 nmol mol−1 but with only 17 samples compared.
BWD did not have any samples at the time of writing, thus
we compare only LEW, MSH, TMD, NEB, and NWB.
Table 2 also reports the mean uncertainty, intended as a
metric for comparison of the standard deviation of the off-
sets. For each ﬂask sample, this uncertainty is the quadra-
ture sum of the continuous data uncertainty (described in
Sect. 4) at that hour, the standard deviation of the 1 min av-
erages in the continuous data during that hour, and the un-
certainty expected in the ﬂask measurement, estimated here
as 0.04 µmolmol−1 for CO2, 1.12 nmol mol−1 for CH4, and
0.59 nmol mol−1 for CO. The values for the ﬂask uncertainty
are from Table 1 in Sweeney et al. (2015), which reports the
average offset between measurements of surface network and
12-pack ﬂasks (such as those used for the NEC) ﬁlled with
identical air after a short-term storage test. For CO2, ﬂask
offsets can be larger than indicated by those dry-air labora-
tory tests (Sweeney et al., 2015; Andrews et al., 2014; Karion
et al., 2013), but we use 0.04 µmolmol−1 regardless because
the average uncertainty in Table 2 is dominated by the atmo-
spheric variability term and increasing the CO2 uncertainty
in the ﬂasks to 0.1 µmolmol−1 (for example) does not change
the values signiﬁcantly.
Standard deviations of the offsets (Table 2) show that there
is quite a bit of scatter in the results, especially at the more
urban sites that exhibit a lot of variability in the continuous
data. For comparison, Turnbull et al. (2015) report agree-
ment for CO2 between the same ﬂask system and continu-
ous in situ measurements in Indianapolis as 0.04 µmolmol−1
(mean) with a standard deviation of 0.38 µmolmol−1, some-
what smaller than what was observed at our sites. The stan-
dard deviation of offsets is usually lower than the average
uncertainty, however, with the exception of CO2 at MSH and
LEW, the two sites for which the ﬂask samples are not inte-
grated over an hour. It is likely that the large variability seen
over an hour is the reason for the large scatter in the offsets.
Because the continuous in situ measurements do not cover
the entire hour of sampling (at the top level, the hourly av-
erage is typically the mean of only 40 min), the variability
may not be captured in the mean uncertainty reported here
and has a larger impact on the comparison than it would if
the continuous hourly average was based on the full hour of
observations. For example, a large plume or spike in concen-
tration during a given hour might occur while the continuous
system is sampling from the lower inlet and thus would not
be included in the hourly average from the continuous sys-
tem, while it would be included in the full 1 h ﬂask sample.

Uncertainty
The data set includes an uncertainty estimate on each hourly
average data point, consistent with recommendations from
the WMO (WMO, 2018). This uncertainty is our estimate
of the uncertainty of the measurement itself and does not in-
clude atmospheric variability or assess the representativeness
of the measurement of a true hourly mean.
4.1
Uncertainty of hourly mole fraction data
Verhulst et al. (2017) outlined a method for calculating an
uncertainty in mole fraction measurements when using the
single-tank calibration correction (drift correction). Here we
present a brief overview but refer the reader to that paper for
further details. All uncertainties are standard uncertainties,
i.e., 1σ or k = 1. In the analysis below, we assume indepen-
dent uncorrelated error components, given no evidence to the
contrary and no physical reason to believe that they should be
correlated; therefore, we sum the various components of the
uncertainty in quadrature.
The uncertainty in the ﬁnal mole fractions (Uair) is ex-
pressed as the quadrature sum of several uncertainty com-

where UH2O is the uncertainty due to the water vapor correc-
tion, UM is a measurement uncertainty, and Uextrap is the un-
certainty of the calibration ﬁt when assigning values relative
to a single standard tank (more detail on this can be found
later in this section and in the following section). UM en-
compasses errors due to drifting standard tank measurements
(Ub), short-term precision (Up), and error in the calibration
standard’s mole fraction assignment by the calibration labo-
ratory (Uscale):

Here we note that Up for CO2 and CH4 is assigned as de-
scribed by Verhulst et al. (2017), as the standard deviation
of the individual measurements during each 1 min average
during a calibration, but for CO it is assigned as the stan-
dard error (standard deviation divided by the square root of
the number of samples in the mean), based on Allan vari-
ance tests (not shown) indicating that the precision of the CO
measurement increases with the number of points used in the
average. If no calibrations have been performed over an en-
tire calendar year, Up is set to the 10th percentile of the stan-
dard deviation of air measurements and Ub is set to a default
value of 0.1 µmolmol−1, 0.5 nmol mol−1, and 4 nmol mol−1
for CO2, CH4, and CO, respectively. This default value for
Ub is based on an upper limit of values that are observed in
the network; typically, Ub is much smaller than these values
(Verhulst et al., 2017). In the current data set, this has only
occurred once: there were no calibrations run at MNC over
the entire 2015 calendar year, but we have no knowledge of
abnormal operations or changes during this period, with an-
alyzer sensitivity being similar before and after this period.
Because these uncertainty components are also tested
through the use of a target tank, or check standard, the uncer-
tainty UM is assigned as the root mean square of the target
tank errors when those exceed the sum of the uncertainties
above.

This residual is calculated by GCWerks, and the root-mean-

10 d or longer, UTGT is set to a default value that is currently
set to 0.2 µmolmol−1, 1 nmol mol−1, and 6 nmol mol−1 for
CO2, CH4, and CO, respectively, based on typical maximum
values for this uncertainty calculated from many sites over
several years. The target tank in the ﬁeld generally has a
concentration value very similar to the calibration tank, thus
this residual is a good estimate of the uncertainty caused by

However, it is not a good indicator of uncertainty at mole
fractions different from that of the calibration tank. There-
fore, we assign an added uncertainty component, Uextrap, in-
dicating the uncertainty that increases as the measurement
value moves farther from the value of the calibration tank in
the case of a single calibration standard. This was found to
be a linear relationship for a series of similar model analyz-
ers that were tested in a laboratory, and the uncertainty was

See Verhulst et al. (2017) for details on determining the unit-
less slope of the uncertainty, epsilon (ε), which is currently
assigned as 0.0025, 0.0031, and 0.0164 for CO2, CH4, and
CO, respectively, for all data that are only drift corrected (i.e.,
not using a high standard).
4.2
Uncertainty for observations with additional
standards available
When a high-standard tank is available and the secondary
correction described in Sect. 3.4 is applied, the uncertainty
analysis remains similar, but the uncertainty Uextrap from
Eqs. (7) and (10) is replaced by an uncertainty in the two-
point ﬁt, Uﬁt. To estimate this uncertainty for CO2 and CH4,
we use the reported uncertainty of the assigned value of the
high-standard and calibration-standard tanks, Uscale, (typi-
cally 0.03 µmolmol−1 CO2 and 0.5 nmol mol−1 CH4 at 1σ)
along with an estimate of the precision of the analyzer, Up,
to estimate an uncertainty in the drift-corrected sensitivity
of the high standard, USDC,hstd, using standard propagation
of errors (black error bar, Fig. 7a). We note that in the case
where the value assigned to the high standard is through a
propagation of the WMO scale at NIST, the assigned value
has additional uncertainty; i.e., Uscale includes both the un-
certainty that NOAA assigned to the cylinders used for the
assignment and the uncertainty from the laboratory ﬁt at
NIST. This second uncertainty is equal to the standard de-
viation of the residuals of the ﬁt and is added in quadrature
to the NOAA uncertainty.
We note that the analysis described below assumes un-
correlated independent errors. We express the slope of drift-
corrected sensitivity (m) and the overall drift-corrected sensi-
tivity (SDC) as functions only of the drift-corrected sensitivity
of the high standard, SDC,hstd:
m =
SDC,hstd −1
X′
hstd/X′
cal −1
(11)
SDC = m
 X′

+ 1.
(12)
This second equation uses b = 1−m. Here we do not include
uncertainty in the x coordinate, i.e., X′/X′
cal. Uncertainty in
the slope is as follows:
Um =


USDC,hstd
(X′hstd/X′cal) −1
.
(13)
We propagate the uncertainty in the drift-corrected sensitivity
of the high standard, USDC,hstd, to the overall drift-corrected
sensitivity of all the air values using Eq. (14) and then to the
two-point corrected air data by propagating through to obtain
Eq. (15).

(15)
To evaluate the use of standard propagation of errors, we
also use a bootstrap to estimate the uncertainty using the lab-
oratory calibration shown in Fig. 6 by randomly selecting
two tanks of the ﬁve tanks from the test to calculate 1000
versions of the correction (blue shading shows the standard
deviation of the result, Fig. 7). For this test, the calculated
1σ uncertainty (red shading) was similar to the 1σ bootstrap
uncertainty (slightly larger for CO2 and slightly smaller for
CH4, not shown). This comparison indicates that the esti-
mated uncertainty using the equations above compares rea-
sonably well with the uncertainty we would derive from a
bootstrap analysis, which gives us conﬁdence in our method-
ology.
The uncertainty in SDC leads to the estimate of the ﬁt un-
certainty, Uﬁt, shown in Fig. 7b. To implement this uncer-
tainty across all times and towers, we calculate it assum-
ing a ﬁxed nominal value of the high calibration standard of
490.50 µmolmol−1 CO2 and 2560.61 nmol mol−1 CH4. This
is based on the value of the high standard that was in resi-
dence in the Earth Networks laboratory when several of the
CRDS analyzers were tested and assigned two-point calibra-
tion corrections. We use the site-speciﬁc (instrument-speciﬁc
and period-speciﬁc) slope and intercept that are applied to the
data (which are static over the time period they are applied)
and the value of the calibration tank to calculate the remain-
der of the values required for the uncertainty analysis.
Only one site so far, MSH, measures continuous CO, and
the history of standard tanks there indicates signiﬁcant uncer-
tainty in tank value assignments with large target tank resid-
uals and corresponding UTGT relative to errors in slope. We
have chosen not to implement the two-point calibration at
this site for CO because the range of slopes of SDC includes
one, i.e., the correction is so small that the uncertainty dwarfs
the correction.
Mean absolute residuals of the two-point ﬁt for nine lab-
oratory calibrations analyzed (seven tested at NOAA/ESRL
and described by Verhulst et al., 2017, Table S2, and two ad-
ditional units at NIST) average to 0.03 µmolmol−1 for CO2

between the calibration and high-standard data, and larger
for the test that included an even higher-concentration tank,
shown in Fig. 7 at ∼711 µmolmol−1 for CO2. The ﬁt uncer-
tainty encompasses (at 1σ) this residual as well (Fig. 7b). The
residuals at lower values can be explained by the uncertainty
in the measurement (precision) and uncertainty in value as-
signment of the tanks. For CO, only eight tests were avail-
able, with a mean residual inside the range of the calibrations
of 1.1 nmol mol−1, higher than the reported reproducibility
from NOAA of 0.4 nmol mol−1 (all values are noted here at
1σ although they are given by NOAA at 2σ). This larger
residual is likely caused by the lower precision of the analyz-
ers for CO but also could be caused by larger uncertainty in
the tank assignments, possibly due to drift in the mole frac-
tion of the tanks themselves. We intend to conduct additional
tests outside the two-point calibration range with additional
analyzers and tanks to evaluate and possibly update this un-
certainty component, Uﬁt, as needed, and especially focus on
CO if and when additional CO measurements are added to
our network.

Network observations
Here we show some observations and time series of CO2
and CH4 from the NEC in situ tower network, focusing on
data coverage, vertical gradients, and observed differences
between urban and rural or outer suburban sites.
5.1
Data coverage and network expansion
The NEC network is continuously growing, with sites com-
ing online at different times. Figure 8 shows the availability
of hourly observations as the various sites have come online.
5.2
Vertical gradients
Observations in global trace gas measurement networks (e.g.,
AGAGE, GGRN) are speciﬁcally sited far from local sources
or strong sinks to ensure that air reaching the site is represen-
tative of the large spatial scales of interest to a global study.
This allows the observations to be more easily interpreted by
a coarser global model (e.g., Peters et al., 2007). In urban
networks, it is desirable to measure trace gas concentrations
closer to sources so that ﬁner spatial gradients can be used
to inform emissions estimates at urban scales. However, a
balance must be struck between the necessity to observe and
distinguish sources that are in close proximity to each other
and the ability of a transport and dispersion model to simu-
late the observations. In some instances, novel ways to sim-
ulate observations at low heights above ground level and in
very dense networks have been used to resolve this problem
(Berchet et al., 2017). In the NEC urban network in Washing-
ton, DC, and Baltimore, the tower sites were selected to be
between 50 and 100 m above the ground given the desire to
place a tower in a speciﬁc location (as identiﬁed in an initial
network design study by Lopez-Coto et al., 2017). Inlets at
two (or three, at SFD) heights on the tower give some insight
as to the proximity of each tower to sources whose emis-
sions are not always vertically well mixed by the time they
reach the inlets, depending on atmospheric stability condi-
tions. Here we report average vertical gradients, determined
using the observations at different levels, for the urban and
background sites in our network. These gradients were calcu-
lated using hourly average data from each level, but because
the instruments are only sampling from one level at any given
time and cycling between them, there is an assumption of
measurements averaged in a given hour being representative
of the entire hour. Because different towers have different in-
let heights and different vertical spacing between the lower
and upper inlet, here we compare three urban sites (ARL,

NDC, and JES) with inlets at similar heights, ∼90 m and
∼50 m a.g.l. We deﬁne the gradient as the mole fraction of
CO2 or CH4 at the topmost inlet minus that of the lowermost
inlet divided by the distance between them so that a negative
gradient indicates a higher concentration at the lower inlet
(the most common case).
Analysis of the diurnal cycle of the vertical gradient at
urban sites in the Washington–Baltimore area (Fig. 9) indi-
cates different characteristics in summer vs. winter. These
differences are most likely caused by different meteorology
and possible seasonal differences in timing of ﬂuxes, espe-
cially for sites inﬂuenced by the urban biosphere. Greater
turbulent mixing in summertime boundary layers and dif-
ferent timing in the boundary layer growth and collapse
mostly dominate the seasonal differences. This analysis
shows that at these three sites the wintertime average gra-
dient in midafternoon hours (deﬁned based on these ﬁgures
as 11:00–16:00 LST) is approximately −0.016 µmolmol−1
m−1 for CO2 (−0.105 nmol mol−1 m−1 for CH4), which
translates to a −0.8 µmolmol−1 (−5.2 nmol mol−1 for CH4)
difference between levels spaced 50 m apart; this is not an in-
signiﬁcant gradient. At other urban sites with shorter towers,
they can be even larger. These observations can help evaluate
vertical mixing in transport and dispersion models that might
be used to estimate emissions, or to identify times when
modeled and observed vertical gradients agree. Large verti-
cal gradients overnight into the early morning at all sites and
seasons are indicative of local sources (likely mostly anthro-
pogenic but also including respiration from the biosphere)
inﬂuencing the observations at these times when there is sta-
ble stratiﬁcation in the boundary layer and concentrations are
higher near the surface. The larger CO2 gradients overnight
in summer compared to winter periods suggest a strong res-
piration signal at these urban sites, with a large degree of
variability between sites indicated by large spread. Nighttime
CH4 gradients are slightly larger in winter than summer, pos-
sibly reﬂecting greater wintertime anthropogenic CH4 emis-
sions, or possibly due to seasonality in mixing layer heights.
The diurnal cycle of the vertical gradients from the
sites identiﬁed as background stations for the Washington–
Baltimore urban network shows large variability in summer-
time gradients between the three stations (Fig. 10). Stafford,
VA (SFD), shows that the surrounding biosphere causes rela-
tively large gradients in nighttime and early morning hours at
this low-density suburban site. These are apparent at Buck-
town, MD (BUC), as well but less so at Thurmont, MD
(TMD), a forested site in western Maryland. The large differ-
ence between summertime early morning vertical CO2 gradi-
ents at SFD and TMD, despite the similar surrounding land
use (mostly deciduous forest, Fig. 3), might be caused by
the elevation difference, as SFD is close to sea level while
TMD is on a ridge at 561 m elevation. BUC observations
show larger CH4 gradients in summer, due to surrounding
wetlands and agriculture (Fig. 3). Wintertime gradients are
near zero at all hours at all three of these sites, indicating that
they are far from local anthropogenic sources of either gas.
We note that the top inlet height at BUC is lower, at 75 m,
than at SFD or TMD (100 and 111 m), while the lower inlet
is similar for all three (∼50 m). For SFD (inlets at 152, 100,
and 50 m), we use the 100 and 50 m inlets to deﬁne the gra-
dient to be more consistent with the inlet heights of the other
towers (Table 1).

5.3
Urban and rural differences in seasonal cycles
Here we continue to describe the network in terms of dif-
ferences between rural (background) and urban stations, de-
termining typical enhancements from urban inﬂuences. The
seasonal cycles of CO2 and CH4 indicate enhancements in
the urban sites in our network relative to the more rural sta-
tions throughout the year (Fig. 11). Summertime CH4 at ur-
ban sites is not as enhanced compared to the rural sites as
it is in winter, possibly due to wetland sources inﬂuencing
the background station at BUC or lower CH4 emissions from
natural gas in urban areas. Similarly, for CO2, some of the
rural stations surrounded by active vegetation (Fig. 3) are
likely to show stronger inﬂuence from biospheric uptake than
urban sites, especially in the summer months (Fig. 10). We
speciﬁcally caution against using any of the in situ data from
the NEC rural stations directly as a background for analy-
sis of the urban enhancement without examining these is-
sues. Sargent et al. (2018) indicate that for an analysis of
CO2 enhancements in the Boston urban area, CO2 observa-
tions from upwind stations alone did not represent the correct
background. Even when the air that reaches an urban tower
originates near an upwind rural site, back trajectories (from
a Lagrangian Particle Dispersion Model such as STILT, for
example) indicate that much of the air may originate from a
higher altitude than the upwind station. Thus, the measure-
ment at an upwind station is not necessarily representative of
the proper background or incoming concentration, given the
large concentration gradients between measurements within
the planetary boundary layer and in the free troposphere near
background stations with local ﬂuxes. Mueller et al. (2018)
conducted an analysis of the issues concerning background
determination for this urban network, mostly concerning the
large emissions of both CO2 and CH4 upwind of the region
that is difﬁcult to capture at upwind stations. We will exam-
ine the proper background for investigating urban enhance-
ments in the Washington, DC, and Baltimore, MD, area fur-
ther in future work.

Conclusions
Here we present a data set of hourly average observations
of CO2, CH4, and CO (where applicable) from a network
of towers in the northeastern United States. Measurements
are funded by NIST and conducted in a collaboration with
Earth Networks, Inc., with quality control, assurance, and
uncertainty determination conducted by a science team that
includes NIST, Earth Networks, and collaborators from the
Los Angeles Megacities Carbon Project from NASA/JPL and
the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. We present 4 calen-
dar years of data (2015 through 2018), with different stations
coming online through the years, and most Washington, DC,
and Baltimore, MD, urban stations becoming established af-
ter late 2015. We have also presented our methodology for
calibrating the measurements to WMO scales for each gas
and determining uncertainties for these measurements, as
recommended by the WMO (WMO, 2018). We show that
analysis of observations at two different inlet heights can be
useful for determining the presence of emissions close to the
towers, which may be necessary for evaluating the efﬁcacy
and choice of transport model used to analyze the data. We
also note that the tower stations that were established to char-
acterize incoming or background air are not necessarily ap-
propriate for use directly as background for the urban sta-
tions, as they are often affected by local ﬂuxes that do not
inﬂuence the urban stations. A more careful treatment of in-
coming background air is necessary for any given analysis.
