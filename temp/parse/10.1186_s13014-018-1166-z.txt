A practical approach to estimating optic
disc dose and macula dose without
treatment planning in ocular brachytherapy
using 125I COMS plaques
Yongsook C. Lee, Shih-Chi Lin and Yongbok Kim*
Abstract
Background: It has been reported that proximity of the tumor to the optic disc and macula, and radiation dose to
the critical structures are substantial risk factors for vision loss following plaque brachytherapy. However, there is
little dosimetry data published on this. In this study, therefore, the relationship between distance from tumor
margin and radiation dose to the optic disc and macula in ocular brachytherapy using 125I Collaborative Ocular
Melanoma Study (COMS) plaques was comprehensively investigated. From the information, this study aimed to
allow for estimation of optic disc dose and macula dose without treatment planning.
Methods: An in-house brachytherapy dose calculation program utilizing the American Association of Physicists in
Medicine Task Group-43 U1 formalism with a line source approximation in a homogenous water phantom was
developed and validated against three commercial treatment planning systems (TPS). Then optic disc dose and macula
dose were calculated as a function of distance from tumor margin for various tumor basal dimensions for seven COMS
plaques (from 10 mm to 22 mm in 2 mm increments) loaded with commercially available 125I seeds models (IAI-125A,
2301 and I25.S16). A prescribed dose of 85 Gy for an irradiation time of 168 h was normalized to a central-axis depth of
5 mm. Dose conversion factors for each seed model were obtained by taking ratios of total reference air kerma per
seed at various prescription depths (from 1 mm to 10 mm in 1 mm intervals) to that at 5 mm.
Results: The in-house program demonstrated relatively similar accuracy to commercial TPS. Optic disc dose and
macula dose decreased as distance from tumor margin and tumor basal dimension increased. Dose conversion factors
increased with increasing prescription depth. There existed dose variations (<8%) among three 125I seed models. Optic
disc dose and macula dose for each COMS plaque and for each seed model are presented in a figure format. Dose
conversion factors for each seed model are presented in a tabular format.
Conclusions: The data provided in this study would enable clinicians in any clinic using 125I COMS plaques to estimate
optic disc dose and macula dose without dose calculations.

Background
Plaque brachytherapy is currently the most common treat-
ment option for early stage or medium-sized intraocular
tumors (≤10 mm in apical height and ≤16 mm in diam-
eter for uveal melanomas) [1–3]. It offers equivalent
tumor control and better quality of life such as eye preser-
vation and vision retention in comparison to enucleation
[3–5]. Various plaque designs were proposed and are clin-
ically used in major institutions [6–8]. Nonetheless,
Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study (COMS) plaques
have been widely used in most clinics since the COMS
established standardized methods of plaque brachytherapy
for medium-sized choroidal melanomas [3].
In plaque brachytherapy for intraocular tumors, major
critical structures related to vision are lens, optic nerve
(optic disc) and macula (fovea). A cataract, clouding of
the lens, is the most common radiotherapy contraindica-
tion but a surgery can restore vision loss due to cata-
racts. On the other hand, radiation damage to the optic
disc and macula can cause permanent vision loss which
is usually not recoverable. Several studies reported out-
comes for vision deterioration/loss following plaque
brachytherapy [4, 5, 9–13]. Some of the studies revealed
that proximity of the tumor to the optic disc and fovea,
and radiation dose are substantial risk factors for vision
loss [4, 5, 9]. However, there is a paucity of literature on
the relationship between proximity of the tumor to the
vision-related critical structures and radiation dose to
them in plaque brachytherapy.
Therefore, this study has comprehensively examined
the relationship between distance from tumor margin
and radiation dose to the optic disc or macula in ocular
brachytherapy using 125I COMS plaques through a dos-
imetry study. By providing the dosimetry data, this study
aims to enable clinicians (both ophthalmologist and ra-
diation oncologist) in any clinic or institution using 125I
COMS plaques to predict optic disc dose and macula
dose at the time of tumor size measurements without
dose calculations in a treatment planning system (TPS).
The American Association of Physicists in Medicine
(AAPM) Task Group (TG) 129 recommends that in dose
calculations, heterogeneity corrections be accounted for
non-tissue materials such as gold-alloy backing and si-
lastic seed carrier insert in the plaque [3]. As of today,
however, there is no commercially available TPS taking
into account heterogeneity corrections. Furthermore, the
hybrid method, homogeneous dose calculations multi-
plied by known heterogeneity correction factors, sug-
gested by the AAPM TG 129, is limited to the obsolete
125I seed model 6711 [3] and there is no correction fac-
tor provided for currently available
125I seed models.
Herein, in current clinical practice, the AAPM TG-43
dosimetry formalism with a line source approximation
in a homogeneous water medium is widely used. In this
study, dose calculations were performed based on the
current clinical practice.
Methods
Determination of parameters required for treatment planning
Following COMS protocols [14], five parameters re-
quired for treatment planning were determined in an
ophthalmologist’s office. Tumor basal dimension at cen-
ter in the direction from optic disc (BD, parameter #1)
and distance from optic disc to tumor margin (DT, par-
ameter #2) were measured in a fundus diagram. Tumor
basal dimension at center in the direction from macula
(BM, parameter #3) and distance from macula to tumor
margin (MT, parameter #4) were also measured in the
same fundus diagram. Tumor height (parameter #5),
which determines a prescription depth, was measured
using ultrasound. The fundus diagram in Fig. 1a illus-
trates BD, DT, BM and MT of the tumor and the cross
section diagram of the eye in Fig. 1b shows apical height
of the tumor. Adequate plaque size was determined by

adding a margin of 2–3 mm to the largest tumor dimen-
sion. Then this information was sent to the department
of radiation oncology for treatment planning.
Validation of our in-house brachytherapy dose calculation
program
For efficient calculations of optic disc dose and macula
dose as a function of parameters mentioned above, an
in-house brachytherapy dose calculation program was
developed in MATLAB® software (vR2016a, Math-
Works, Natick, MA) and validated against three com-
mercial
TPS
for
benchmark
calculations
in
the
literature [15]. The conventional AAPM TG-43 Update
(TG-43 U1) dosimetry formalism with a line source ap-
proximation in a homogeneous water medium was in-
corporated into the in-house program. Parameters for
the TG-43 U1 formalism including radial dose function
(Table II in TG-43 U1) and anisotropy function (Table
V in TG-43 U1) were taken from the TG-43 U1 [16].
The step size over distance “r” and polar angle “θ” for
radial
dose
function
and
anisotropy
function
was
coarser in the TG-43 U1 than that in Rivard et al.
study. In our in-house program, linear interpolation
was used to obtain radial dose function and anisotropy
function
values,
while
in
Rivard
et
al.,
log-linear
interpolation was used for radial dose function values
and linear interpolation for anisotropy function values.
Seed coordinates for COMS plaques taken from Table I
in the AAPM TG 129 [3] were also incorporated into
the program. In Rivard et al.’s benchmark test, doses at
several points along the central-axis and at off-axis
points for organs at risk (OARs) were calculated in
commercial TPS for a 16 mm COMS plaque loaded
with 125I seeds (Amersham Oncoseed 6711). The TPS
include P3 (Pinnacle3, v8.0dpl, Philips Medical Systems,
Cleveland, OH), BV (BrachyVision™, v8.1, Varian Med-
ical Systems, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) and PS (Plaque Simu-
lator, v5.3.9, Eye Physics LLC, Los Alamitos, CA) which
all use a line source approximation in homogeneous
water phantoms [15]. In all three TPS, air-kerma
strength (Sk) per seed (unit: U = μGym2h−1) was kept
the same (4.572 U) to deliver approximately 85 Gy to a
central-axis depth of 5 mm for an irradiation time of
100 h. The central-axis depth is the distance along the
plaque central-axis from the inner sclera. Central-axis
and off-axis point doses for this benchmark test were
calculated in our in-house program. Total reference air
kerma (TRAK = Sk × irradiation time) per seed (unit:
μGym2) was kept the same (4.572 U × 100 h) as in the
benchmark test. Then, for each point, our data were
compared with those in Rivard et al.’s study by comput-
ing the modulus of a relative percent difference in dose
using the following equation:

where Din is dose calculated in our in-house program
and Dref is reference dose from Rivard et al.’s study.
Calculations of optic disc dose and macula dose for
standard COMS plaques loaded with 125I seeds
Optic disc dose and macula dose for standard COMS
plaques were calculated in the in-house program. Dose
calculations were performed as a function of distance
from tumor margin (DT or MT) up to 10 mm for vari-
ous tumor basal dimensions (BD or BM) (<20 mm in
2 mm intervals). A prescribed dose of 85 Gy for an ir-
radiation time of 168 h was normalized at a central-axis
depth of 5 mm. The calculations were performed for all
seven different-sized COMS plaques (from 10 mm to
22 mm in diameter in 2 mm increments) and for three
currently, commercially available 125I seeds models (Iso-
Aid Advantage IAI-125A, Best Industries 2301 and Bebig
I25.S16) of the seed models listed in the AAPM TG 129
[3]. Parameters in the dosimetry formalism for the three
seed models were taken from the AAPM TG-43 U1 [16]
and supplement to the AAPM TG-43 U1 [17].
Generation of dose conversion factors for different
prescription depths
Since a prescription depth is determined based on the
tumor apex (COMS protocols [14] or American Brachy-
therapy Society (ABS) guidelines [18]) and it is not al-
ways
5 mm,
dose
conversion factors for different
prescription depths were generated in the in-house pro-
gram. Optic disc dose and macula dose were calculated
for prescription depths from 1 mm to 10 mm in 1 mm
intervals. The prescribed dose (85 Gy) and irradiation
time (168 h) were kept the same as for prescription
depth of 5 mm. Then ratios of TRAK per seed to obtain
85 Gy to each prescription depth to that to 5 mm were
taken as dose conversion factors. The calculations were
performed for all seven COMS plaques and for the three
seed models mentioned above.

Table 2 presents the comparison of doses at OAR

centered on equator on temporal side (9 o’clock), on
nasal side (3 o’clock), on superior side (12 o’clock) and
on inferior side (6 o’clock), respectively [15]. Coordinates

plaque positions #1 (4.39%) and #3 (4.40%).
Optic disc dose and macula dose for standard COMS
plaques loaded with 125I seeds
Optic disc dose and macula dose for standard COMS
plaques loaded with
125I seeds (model IAI-125A) are
shown in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. Figure 2a-g presents
optic disc dose as a function of DT up to 10 mm for
various BDs in 2 mm intervals for seven COMS plaques
when 85 Gy is prescribed at a central-axis depth of
5 mm for an irradiation time of 168 h. Optic disc dose
decreases with increasing DT and increasing BD. For the
plaques ≥16 mm, however, there exist some regions
where optic disc dose does not change much with DT
(i.e., flat regions in Fig. 2d-g). This usually occurs within
short distances (≤5 mm of DT) when BD is less than or
equal to 5 mm. For example, for the 16 mm COMS
plaque (Fig. 2d), the graph for BD = 1 mm does not vary
a lot at <3 mm of DT and the graph for BD = 3 mm does
not change much at <2 mm of DT, respectively. Plaque
size also determines optic disc dose and the shape of dose
curves. Macula dose is displayed in Fig. 3a-g as a function
of MT for various BMs. Similar patterns to optic disc dose
are observed. Optic disc dose and macula dose for the
other two seed models (2301 and I25.S16) are presented
as Additional file 1 (data not shown here).
There are variations of optic disc dose and macula
dose among seed models. The maximum relative differ-
ences (%) in optic disc dose between IAI-125A and
2301, between IAI-125A and I25.S16, and between 2301
and I25.S16 are 7.74, 5.89 and 5.28%, respectively. Cor-
responding maximum relative differences (%) for macula
dose are 7.39, 5.64 and 5.28%.

for tumors with apical height <5 mm [14], dose conver-
sion factors were normalized to a depth of 5 mm. The
factors increase with increasing prescription depth. The
factors increase with increasing plaque size for a pre-
scription depth <5 mm but the opposite is observed for
a depth >5 mm. Table 3 is used for both optic disc dose
and macula dose estimation when a prescription depth
is not 5 mm. Dose conversion factors for the other two
125I seed models (2301 and I25.S16) are provided as
Additional file 2 (data not shown here). The differences
of the factors among seed models increase with increas-
ing prescription depth and decreasing plaque size. Max-
imum absolute differences between IAI-125A and 2301,
between IAI-125A and I25.S16, and between 2301 and
I25.S16 are 0.08, 0.1 and 0.02, respectively.
Estimation of optic disc dose without dose calculations:
clinical application of this study
Optic disc dose (Fig. 2), macula dose (Fig. 3) and dose
conversion factors (Table 3) presented in the current
study can be conveniently used in clinic. As an example,
there is a clinical case in which BD is 3 mm, DT is
3 mm and apical height is 4 mm. A clinician wants to
prescribe 85 Gy to the tumor apex (i.e., 4 mm) using a
10 mm COMS plaque loaded with 125I seeds (model
IAI-125A). From the data obtained in this study, optic
disc dose is about 145 Gy for the 10 mm COMS plaque
and for a prescription depth of 5 mm (Fig. 2a). The dose
conversion factor for the 10 mm COMS plaque and for
a prescription depth of 4 mm is 0.77 (Table 3). Thus, for
this clinical case, expected optic disc dose is 112 Gy
(=145 Gy × 0.77) which is lower than that when pre-
scribed at 5 mm by 33 Gy. If tumor apex is higher (for
instance, 6 mm) for the same tumor, optic disc dose for
the same 125I seed model is about 184 Gy (=145 Gy ×
1.27) (Table 3).
Discussion
Our in-house brachytherapy dose calculation program
demonstrated similar accuracy in brachytherapy dose
calculations to commercial TPS. As presented in Tables 1
and 2, dose differences at central-axis and off-axis points
between our in-house program and the three TPS used
in Rivard et al.’s study were <2.4% except for the lac-
rimal gland point for plaque positions #1 and #3.
Some seeds in plaque positions #1 and #3 have small
polar angles (< 40 degrees) to the lacrimal gland
point.
At
small
polar
angles,
anisotropy
function
values vary more dramatically with polar angle than
at large polar angles, leading to larger uncertainty in
the interpolation of anisotropy function values. As
mentioned in the Methods, Rivard et al.’s study used
smaller step size over distance “r” and polar angle “θ”
for anisotropy function than our in-house program
(AAPM TG-43 U1), causing larger dose differences

This study showed that optic disc dose and macula
dose strongly depend on distance from tumor margin
(DT and MT) and tumor basal dimension (BD and BM).

In the COMS protocols, coordinates for the optic disc
and macula are determined by the combination of these
two parameters. Hence, the two parameters determine
optic disc dose and macula dose. At close proximity (up
to about 1 cm) of 125I seeds (plaque), the inverse square
law effect is severe. At farther distances, however, the ra-
dial dose function for
125I seeds drastically decreases
with distance because of its low photon energy (average
energy: 28 keV) and consequently, rapid dose fall-off is
observed. As a result, optic disc dose and macula dose
decrease as DT and MT increase (Figs. 2 and 3), respect-
ively. Optic disc dose and macula dose also decrease as
BD and BM increase (Figs. 2 and 3), respectively because
optic disc and macula become far away from the center
of tumor as BD and BM increase, respectively. For pla-
ques ≥16 mm, however, there are regions in which dose
does not change much with distance (Figs. 2d-g and
3d-g). This occurs particularly for small basal dimen-
sions at a tumor margin-to-critical structure distance
≤5 mm. As shown in Fig. 4a, for BD of 5 mm, as DT in-
creases, an optic dose point becomes far away from seed
#21 but simultaneously close to seeds #12 and #5. As a
result, optic disc dose points between 2 mm and 4 mm
of DT are in the same dose color map (three yellow dots
in Fig. 4a) and optic disc dose is invariant within that re-
gion. On the other hand, for BD of 13 mm, an optic disc
dose point becomes far away from seeds #12 and #5 with
increasing DT. Therefore, each dose point between
2 mm and 4 mm is located in a different dose color map
and optic disc dose decreases as DT increases (Fig. 4b).
For the same reason, similar patterns are observed in
macula dose (Fig. 3).
Optic disc dose and macula dose also have dependence
on prescription depth and plaque size. The dependence
can be explained with trends of dose conversion factors
(Table 3) and TRAK values per seed (Table 4) as follows.
First, for each plaque size, TRAK per seed to obtain a
prescribed dose to a prescription depth increases with
increasing prescription depth because a deeper prescrip-
tion depth requires higher TRAK per seed. Hence, dose
conversion factors increase with prescription depth. Sec-
ond, for each prescription depth, TRAK per seed does
not continuously decrease with increasing plaque size
due to the number of seeds used in each COMS plaque
(e.g., 24 seeds for 20 mm plaque and 21 seeds for
22 mm plaque). Thus, dose conversion factors do not al-
ways continuously increase (depth <5 mm) or decrease
(depth >5 mm) with increasing plaque size. Third, TRAK
per seed increases more rapidly with increasing prescrip-
tion depth for smaller plaques than for larger plaques.
The following example for seed model IAI-125A sup-
ports this trend. For the 10 mm plaque, TRAK per seed
increases from 299.9 μGym2 to 2923.5 μGym2 (9.7-fold
increase) when a prescription depth increases from
1 mm to 10 mm. On the other hand, for the 22 mm
plaque, the increase of TRAK per seed by the depth in-
crease from 1 mm to 10 mm is 4.6-fold (from 157.3
μGym2 to 718.6 μGym2). Thus, dose conversion factors
increase more rapidly with increasing prescription depth
for smaller plaques than for larger plaques, resulting in
the increase in dose conversion factors with plaque size
at a depth <5 mm but the decrease with plaque size at a
depth >5 mm.
There exist dose differences among seed models. The
differences are caused by differences of the parameters
used in the AAPM TG-43 U1 dosimetry formalism
which result from different seed geometry and internal
construction among three seed models [16, 19]. As re-
ported in the Results, the differences can be fairly signifi-
cant (up to 7.7%) and similar results were reported by
Thomson et al. [19]. Thomson et al. performed MC cal-
culations for a 16 mm COMS plaque loaded with 125I
seeds under TG-43 assumptions (i.e., a homogeneous
medium) and showed that doses differed by up to 11%
for different seed models [19].
The results presented in this study will be beneficial to
the clinic using 125I COMS plaques and help improve
current clinical practice as follows. First, this study
would allow clinicians to estimate optic disc dose and
macula dose without dose calculations. Figures 2 and 3
and Table 3 or the data in additional files can be easily
looked up as in the example discussed in the Results. In
this study, the calculations were based on a prescribed
dose of 85 Gy. In clinical cases where a prescribed dose
is different from 85 Gy (e.g., re-irradiation or treatment
of benign lesions), a dose scaling factor (prescribed dose
(Gy)/85 Gy) can be multiplied by optic disc dose or mac-
ula dose obtained in this study to estimate dose to the
Table 3 Dose conversion factors (ratios of total reference air
kerma per seed) for different prescription depths (1 mm –
10 mm in 1 mm intervals) for standard COMS plaques loaded
with 125I seeds (model IAI-125A). A reference depth for dose
conversion factors is 5 mm

critical structures. Second, if an estimated dose to the
OARs is high enough to be paid attention to, clinicians
may take an action to reduce dose to the OARs by pre-
scribing to a different depth or by the use of a notched
plaque [20]. As discussed in the example in the Results,
prescribing 85 Gy to 4 mm (recent ABS guidelines [18]:
prescribing at the tumor apex for all medium-sized chor-
oidal melanomas) can give lower dose to the optic disc

and b 13 mm basal dimension (BD). The positions in yellow (DT = 2 mm – 4 mm) in the a represent where dose does not change much

than prescribing 85 Gy to 5 mm (COMS protocols [14]:
prescribing at 5 mm for the tumor apex <5 mm and to
the apex for the tumor apex ≥5 mm [15]) (112 Gy vs.
145 Gy) due to lower TRAK per seed at a shallower depth.
For the tumor apex ≥5 mm, prescribing dose to a shal-
lower depth would reduce optic disc dose but tumor
coverage can be compromised. Third, this study would
enable clinicians to correlate clinical outcomes for vision
with optic disc dose or macula dose. There have been no
good published correlation data between clinical out-
comes and radiation dose. If clinical outcomes for vision
are available along with corresponding distance from
tumor margin (DT and MT), tumor basal dimensions (BD
and BM), plaque size, prescription depth, prescribed dose
and seed model, one can correlate the outcomes with
optic disc dose and macula dose which can be looked up
from the results presented in this study. From the correl-
ation data, clinicians can anticipate outcomes for vision
for a given clinical situation and find a possible way to re-
duce dose to the critical structures before treatment. Fur-
thermore, using the correlation data, tolerance dose to the
optic disc or macula in ocular brachytherapy, which has
not been known yet, can be investigated.
Conclusions
This study has comprehensively examined optic disc
dose and macula dose as a function of distance from
tumor margin in ocular brachytherapy using 125I COMS
plaques and has shown that dose to the critical struc-
tures has dependence on multiple parameters such as
distance from tumor margin, tumor basal dimension,
prescription depth, plaque size, and seed model. In any
clinic or institution utilizing
125I COMS plaques, the
dosimetry data provided in this study can be looked up
to estimate optic disc dose and macula dose without
dose calculations in a TPS.
