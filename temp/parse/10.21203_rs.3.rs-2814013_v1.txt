Abstract
The expansion of many wetland species is a function of both clonal propagation and sexual reproduction. The production 
of ramets through clonal propagation enables plants to move and occupy space near parent ramets, while seeds produced 
by sexual reproduction enable species to disperse and colonize open or disturbed sites both near and far from parents. 
The balance between clonal propagation and sexual reproduction is known to vary with plant density but few studies have 
focused on reproductive allocation with density changes in response to global climate change. Schoenoplectus americanus 
is a widespread clonal wetland species in North America and a dominant species in Chesapeake Bay brackish tidal wet-
lands. Long-term experiments on responses of S. americanus to global change provided the opportunity to compare the two 
modes of propagation under different treatments. Seed production increased with increasing shoot density, supporting the 
hypothesis that factors causing increased clonal reproduction (e.g., higher shoot density) stimulate sexual reproduction and 
dispersal of genets. The increase in allocation to sexual reproduction was mainly the result of an increase in the number of 
ramets that flowered and not an increase in the number of seeds per reproductive shoot, or the ratio between the number 
of flowers produced per inflorescence and the number of flowers that developed into seeds. Seed production increased in 
response to increasing temperatures and decreased or did not change in response to increased ­CO2 or nitrogen. Results from 
this comparative study demonstrate that plant responses to global change treatments affect resource allocation and can alter 
the ability of species to produce seeds.

Introduction
Global change impacts submersed and emergent plant com-
munities globally (Short et al. 2016). To understand the 
dispersion and establishment of tidal wetland species, it is 
important to examine their responses to changing climate 
conditions. Several studies have focused on the responses 
of tidal wetland species to changes in environmental factors. 
Gabler et al. (2017) showed that mangroves respond mostly 
to temperature, ­CO2, and changes in hydrology. Nehring and 
Hesse (2008) suggested that the spread of Spartina angelica, 
an invasive species, is most likely due to increasing global 
temperatures. Phragmites australis, a cosmopolitan inva-
sive species, is likely to benefit from global changes (Eller 
et al. 2017) such as an extended growing season, increased 
nutrient pollution, and higher concentrations of atmospheric 
­CO2 (Caplan et al. 2015; Mozdzer et al. 2016). While these 
and other studies have assessed the responses of tidal wet-
land plant communities and ecosystem-level parameters 
such as plant biomass or productivity to changing climate 
conditions, few studies have focused on the reproductive 
responses of plants to changing environmental conditions.

Expansion of wetland species is a function of both clonal 
and sexual reproduction. Clonal propagation is an adaptive 
strategy by which plants produce genetically identical indi-
viduals that are spaced apart from each other and exchange 
resources through belowground tissues such as rhizomes, 
roots, and stolons (de Kroon and van Groenendael 1997; 
Cornelissen et al. 2014). Clonality is a successful strategy 
in flowering plants as demonstrated by the enormous diver-
sity of morphological features associated with clonal species 
(Klimešová 2018). It enables plants to move and occupy space, 
often to the exclusion of species (Zedler and Kercher 2004). 
On the other hand, sexual reproduction is also an important 
strategy that enables species to colonize open or disturbed 
sites (Kettenring et al. 2015; Kettenring and Whigham 2018). 
While the benefits of each type of reproduction are clear, it 
has been difficult to generalize how the allocation to sexual 
reproduction in ecologically important clonal plants responds 
to different environmental conditions (Cornelissen et al. 2014).
Some studies suggested that the allocation of effort to 
these two propagation modes vary with plant density. It was 
predicted that sexual reproduction should be favored at low 
plant densities where potential success of sexual reproduc-
tion is higher (Loehle 1987; Newell and Tramer 1978) and 
decreasing reproductive effort in response to increasing 
density has been reported (Snell and Burch 1975; Williams 
et al. 1977; Law et al. 1979; Humphrey and Pyke 1998). In 
contrast, there is also evidence that seed production at higher 
densities is an adaptive trait. Giroux and Bédard (1995) 
found greater seed production associated with higher shoot 
densities of Scirpus pungens (Schoenoplectus pungens) in 
brackish tidal wetlands. Similar tendencies were reported 
in other species such as Tussilago farfara (Ogden 1974; 
Abrahamson 1975; Holler and Abrahamson 1977; Demetrio 
et al. 2020). Ikegami et al. (2012) used a lattice modeling 
approach to predict that the production of seeds at high den-
sities is the most efficient evolutionary strategy.
In this study, we focused on the allocation of resources to 
sexual reproduction in Schoenoplectus americanus, an abun-
dant wetland clonal ­C3 plant in the sedge family that has vari-
able resource allocation in response to differences in shoot 
density. Ikegami (2004) showed that S. americanus produced 
more flowering shoots and increased inflorescence mass in 
patches with higher shoot densities. Ikegami did not, however, 
examine aspects of seed productivity in response to differences 
in density. Neither has the allocation of resources to sexual 
reproduction been examined as part of long-term experi-
ments to characterize the species response to differences in 
­CO2 concentration, nitrogen availability, temperature, and sea 
level rise (Arp and Drake 1991; Langley and Megonigal 2010; 
White et al. 2012; Langley et al. 2013; Mozdzer et al. 2016; 
Noyce et al. 2019; Lu et al. 2019; Pastore et al. 2017; Cott 
et al. 2020; Gabriel et al. 2022). We focused on two questions 
related to S. americanus sexual reproduction: (i) Does sexual 
reproductive effort increase with increasing shoot density, and 
(ii) Does sexual reproductive effort, measured by increased 
allocation to seed production, vary in response to the global 
change treatments of elevated ­CO2, temperature, and nitrogen. 
We examined these topics by analyzing annual shoot density 
data from three long-term experiments in combination with 
measurements of density and allocation to sexual reproduction 
at the long-term experimental sites.
Methods
Study Site and Species
This study was conducted at the Global Change Research 
Wetland (GCReW), part of Kirkpatrick Marsh (38° 53′ N, 
76° 33′ W), a 22-ha brackish tidal wetland in the Rhode 
River subestuary of Chesapeake Bay (Fig. 1). The wetland 
varies in elevation such that inundation occurs in 37% of the 
area twice per day, 41% once per day, and 20% once daily 
to twice a month (Holmquist et al. 2021). The experimen-
tal area is flooded approximately 40% of the time, the tidal 
range is 44 cm, and the mean soil salinity ranges from 7.8 
to 8.5 ppt (Gabriel et al. 2022). The dominant species are 
the ­C3 sedge S. americanus and the ­C4 grasses Spartina pat-
ens (Aiton) Muhl. and Distichlis spicata (L.) Kuntze. Other 
abundant species are Iva frutescens L., Kosteletzkya virgi-
nica (L.) C. Presl ex A. Gray, and Schoenoplectus robustus 
(Pursh) Soják. The invasive non-native haplotype of Phrag-
mites australis (Cav.) Trin. E Steud. is also present and has 
increased in abundance in recent decades (Holmquist et al. 
2021; McCormick et al. 2010).
S. americanus is distributed in tidal wetlands on the 
coasts of North and South America (Fig. 1; Koyama 1963; 
Tiner and Burke 1995) and is a dominant or co-dominant 
plant in GCReW experiments that focus on species and eco-
system responses to elevated ­CO2, nitrogen (N), and temper-
ature (Drake et al. 1989; Erickson et al. 2007; Pastore et al. 
2016, 2017; Langley et al. 2009a, b; Lu et al. 2019; Noyce 
et al. 2019; Zhu et al. 2022; Gabriel et al. 2022).
CO2 Experiment
This experiment began in 1987 to investigate plant responses 
to elevated ­CO2 and was established in three different plant 
communities (Drake et al. 1989; Drake 1992). One commu-
nity, hereafter referred to as “C3,” was dominated by S. ameri-
canus. The second community, hereafter referred to as “C4,” 
was dominated by Spartina patens and Distichlis spicata. Both 
species are in the Poaceae and use the ­C4 photosynthetic path-
way (Ehleringer and Cerling 2002) that responds minimally to 
178

elevated ­CO2 compared to ­C3 species (Ghannoum et al. 2000). 
A third community, hereafter referred to as “Mixed,” had all 
three species. Each community has deviated from the original 
composition in 1986, generally increasing in dominance of 
relatively flood-tolerant S. americanus (Gabriel et al. 2022). In 
each community, there are 5 open-top chambers (ca. 1 m diam-
eter) that continuously receive ambient air and five chambers 
that receive ambient air + 340 ppm ­CO2 (the level of ­CO2 that 
was chosen when the original experiment was started; it repre-
sented a doubling of atmospheric ­CO2 at that time; Drake 1992) 
during treatment periods. There are also five non-chamber 
controls in each community, hereafter referred to as “control 
plots.” The ambient and elevated treatments run 24 h per day 
from May 1 to October 31 annually.
CO2 × N Experiment
A second long-term experiment that also uses open-top 
chambers was initiated in 2006 to investigate plant and eco-
system responses to elevated ­CO2 and N addition (Langley 
et al. 2009a, b). The study was established in an area of the 
Kirkpatrick Marsh that was in the same general location as 
the ­CO2 experiment but where the plant community was 
dominated by S. americanus. Five chambers (ca. 2 m diam-
eter) receive ambient air, five chambers receive elevated ­CO2 
(ambient air + 340 ppm ­CO2), five chambers receive ambient 
air and elevated soil nitrogen, and five chambers receive 
elevated ­CO2 and N addition. Each chamber has an outside 
non-chambered control area, hereafter referred to as “control 
plots.” Chambers that receive ­CO2 are managed using the 
same protocols as described above for the ­CO2 experiment, 
except that ­CO2 is added only during daylight hours. Cham-
bers in the N addition treatment are fertilized monthly from 
May to September with ­NH4Cl (5 g N ­m−2 ­month−1 = 25 g 
N ­m−2 ­year−1), a level chosen to represent a polluted system 
(Langley and Megonigal 2010).
Warming Experiment
In 2016, the Salt Marsh Accretion Response to Tempera-
ture eXperiment (SMARTX) was initiated to investigate 
plant and ecosystem responses to whole-ecosystem warm-
ing using infrared lamps and belowground heating cables 
(Noyce et al. 2019). We used the 12 experimental plots 
in the S. americanus-dominated plant community (a.k.a. 
­C3 community) treated with four levels of warming (con-
trol, + 1.7 °C, + 3.4 °C, + 5.1 °C) at ambient ­CO2, with 
each treatment replicated three times. The temperature 
range was chosen to cover projected temperatures for the 
Chesapeake Bay region in 2100. Using four treatment lev-
els allows the researchers to determine if the temperature 
gradient results in nonlinear responses for the variables 
measured (Noyce et al. 2019). Thus, replication in the 
warming experiment (n = 3) was lower than in the other 
two experiments (n = 5).
Schoenoplectus Density and Sexual Reproduction
During the 2019 growing season (August–September), we 
counted the number of vegetative and reproductive shoots in

Chesapeake Bay. A Black dots show the distribution of Schoenoplec-
tus americanus. B Enlarged map showing the location of the study

was provided from GBIF Occurrence Download (https://​doi.​org/​10.​

Information System (QGIS) software version 3.16.0 (QGIS Develop-
ment Team 2002). The base map was obtained from Natural Earth

each chamber and control plot for each of the three experi-
ments. We randomly harvested 10 flowering shoots from 
each chamber and plot for determination of reproductive 
effort (described below). If there were fewer than 10 flow-
ering shoots per chamber or plot, we harvested all of them.
Flowering shoots produce a terminal inflorescence com-
posed of 1–15 spikelets. Each spikelet has one or more flow-
ers that can develop into fruits that are a firm, brown achene. 
In the laboratory, we counted the number of spikelets on 
each harvested shoot and dissected each spikelet to deter-
mine the number of mature and dispersed fruits. The number 
of dispersed fruits could be determined because each one left 
a depression on the spikelet rachilla. Immature fruits on each 
spikelet, always at the terminal end of a spikelet, were also 
counted. Immature fruits were much smaller than mature 
fruits, were not black, and were still subtended by a bract 
that is not present at the base of mature fruits.
Data Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.6.0 
(R Core Team 2019). To evaluate seed reproduction, three 
sexual reproduction variables were used: (1) flowering ratio 
(the ratio of the number of flowering shoots to the total num-
ber of shoots), (2) potential seed production (sum of mature 
and immature seeds) per reproductive shoot, and (3) ratio of 
mature to potential seeds in each reproductive shoot.
To test the hypothesis that sexual reproductive effort 
increased with increasing shoot density, we performed a 
logistic regression model for variables 1 and 3, and a linear 
regression model for variable 2 to examine the association 
of shoot density and the three reproduction variables. These 
analyses were performed with the glm and lm functions. We 
also calculated the main and interactive effects of a factorial 
combination of shoot density and treatment. In each experi-
ment, shoot count data from control plots and all treatments 
were pooled and analyzed with the models.
The effects of experimental treatments ­(CO2, N, temperature) 
on the three reproductive variables were also examined. Data 
for the three reproductive variables were tested for normality 
with the Shapiro–Wilk test (Shapiro.test function in the stats 
R package version 3.6.0) before and after log transformation. 
Log transformation was accomplished by applying the equa-
tion log(x + 1) to each data set. We used untransformed data 
on the following analysis because the data were not normally 
distributed either before or after log transformation (Supple-
mental Table 1). For the ­CO2 experiment, the main effects 
and interactions between treatments (control, ambient ­CO2, 
elevated ­CO2) and communities ­(C3, ­C4, Mixed) were ana-
lyzed with the Scheirer-Ray-Hare test, a non-parametric test 
for a two-way factorial design (scheirerRayHare function in the 
rcompanion R package version 2.3.25) and differences of all 
pairs of groups were compared with the Steel–Dwass test, a 
non-parametric test using ranks for multiple comparison. For the 
­CO2 × N and warming experiments, treatments were compared 
using Kruskal–Wallis test (kruskal.test function in the stats R 
package version 3.6.0) and differences of all pairs of groups 
were compared with Steel–Dwass test. We considered p val-
ues of < 0.05 to be particularly meaningful but this arbitrary p 
value threshold was not used as the sole source of inference to 
judge whether our results were scientifically meaningful (Smith 
2020). We also made comparisons of the treatment effect for 
the three experiments by calculating an absolute difference of 
the response variables between the treatment chambers with the 
ambient chambers or + 0 °C plots.
Results
Sexual Reproductive Effort Responses to Differences 
in Shoot Density in Non‑Chambered Control Plots
The flowering ratio increased significantly as shoot den-
sity increased in the control plots of all three experiments 
(Fig. 2A, D, G; Table 1). In the ­CO2 experiment, the number 
of potential seeds per reproductive shoot and the ratio of 
mature seeds to potential seeds increased with increasing 
shoot density in the control plots (Fig. 2B, C; Table 1). In 
the ­CO2 × N experiment, the number of potential seeds was 
positively related to shoot density, but the relationship was 
not significant and the ratio of mature to potential seeds was 
negative in the control plots (Fig. 2E, F; Table 1). There was 
no relationship between the two seed-related variables and 
density in the warming experiment control plots (Fig. 2H, 
I; Table 1).
Sexual Reproduction Responses Under 
Experimental Conditions
CO2 Experiment
The number of potential seeds per reproductive shoot and 
the ratio of mature to potential seeds differed sharply among 
treatments (Table 2). The flowering ratio were not signifi-
cantly different, but the means were greater in the ambient 
and elevated chambers (Fig. 3A). The number of potential 
seeds was higher in the ambient and elevated chambers com-
pared to controls (Fig. 3B). The ratio of mature to potential 
seeds were also higher in the ambient chambers compared 
to the controls and elevated chambers, particularly in the 
elevated chambers (control vs. ambient: p = 0.011, ambient 
vs. elevated: p = 5.9E-05 in Steel–Dwass test, Fig. 3C). The 
number of potential seeds and the ratio of mature to potential 
seeds differed among communities (Table 2), and treatments 
and communities interacted to affect the ratio of mature to 
potential seeds (Table 2). The means and standard errors for

(Fig. 3F). Means and standard errors for three reproductive 
variables are in Supplemental Table 2. It is difficult to compare 
the controls and chambers in this experiment because during 
the summer of 2019, an outbreak of an unknown insect, not 
apparent in most years, consumed inflorescences inordinately 
in the control plots (A. Langley, personal observation). The 
treatment effect of elevated ­CO2 and nitrogen on all three vari-
ables and the number of potential and mature seeds per ­m2 was 
negative (Fig. 3J, K, L and Supplemental Fig. 2G, H).
Warming Experiment
There were significant treatment differences for the flow-
ering ratio and the number of potential seeds per reproduc-
tive shoot (Table 2). Warming increased the flowering ratio 
and the number of potential seeds (Fig. 3G, H). The ratio of 
mature to potential seeds were not significantly different but 
were greater in all warming plots (Fig. 3I). Means and stand-
ard error for three reproductive variables are in Supplemen-
tal Table 2. The treatment effect of temperature on all three 
variables and the number of potential and mature seeds per 
­m2 was positive (Fig. 3J, K, L and Supplemental Fig. 2G, H).

positive relationship between the flowering ratio and density 
in the elevated chambers (Fig. 4A; Table 1). The number of 
potential seeds increased with increasing shoot density in 
the control plots (Fig. 2B). However, the relationship was 
significantly negative in the ambient chambers and while the 
relationship was positive in the elevated chambers it was not 
significant (Fig. 4B; Table 1). The ratio of mature to poten-
tial seeds increased in the controls and treatment chambers 
(Figs. 2C and 4C; Table 1).
CO2 × N Experiment
The flowering ratio was significantly related to shoot den-
sity in the control plots (Fig. 2D). The relationship was 
negative in the ambient chambers (Fig. 4D; Table 1) and 
there were no significant relationships in the other three 
treatments (Fig. 4D, G; Table 1). The number of potential 
seeds was positively related to shoot density, but the rela-
tionship was not statistically significant in the control plots 
(Fig. 2E). The relationships were not significant in treat-
ment chambers (Fig. 4E, H). The ratio of mature to poten-
tial seeds had a negative relationship to density in the con-
trol chambers (Fig. 2F). However, the ratio increased with 
increasing shoot density in the ambient and elevated + N 
chambers (Fig. 4F, I; Table 1).
Warming Experiment
The flowering ratio increased with increasing shoot den-
sity in control plots (Fig. 2G) and the + 3.4 °C and + 5.1 °C 
plots but the relationship was not statistically significant in 
the + 1.7 °C plots (Fig. 4J; Table 1). The number of potential 
seeds had no statistically significant relationship to density 
in any of the elevated temperature plots (Fig. 4K; Table 1). 
The ratio of mature to potential seeds had no statistically sig-
nificant relationship to density in control plots (Fig. 2I) but 
the relationships were negative and statistically significant 
in the + 1.7 and + 3.4 °C plots and positive and statistically 
significant in the + 5.1 °C plots (Fig. 4L; Table 1).
Discussion
In over 35 years of experimental research, S. americanus 
in the Kirkpatrick Marsh has been temporally dynamic 
with changes in the relative abundance and morphology. 
The changes have occurred in each of the areas where the 
long-term experiments have been conducted but espe-
cially in the communities where the ­CO2 experiment is 
located. The density of S. americanus increased in each of 
the three communities, at the expense of Spartina patens 
(Drake 2014; Lu et al. 2019). Lu et al. (2019) found that the 
diameter and height of ramets of S. americanus decreased 
over the first 30 years of the experiment, and the results 
of the present study demonstrate that changes in the den-
sity of ramets can influence the reproductive effort of S. 
americanus. We also found that the relationship between 
seed production and ramet density may vary depending 
on experimental conditions. S. americanus is widespread 
nationally (Fig. 1; Smith 2002), is a dominant species in 
Chesapeake Bay wetlands (McCormick and Somes 1982), 
and will be an important species in coastal wetlands as they 
respond to changing climatic conditions (Noyce et al. 2023; 
Vahsen et al. 2023). It is an especially important species in 
influencing wetland response to sea level rise as it is most 
abundant and productive when tidal flooding is frequent 
(Kirwan and Guntenspergen 2015; Holmquist et al. 2021).
The long-term GCReW experiments have focused on 
plant production and density responses in S. americanus, 
but none of the prior research considered seed production 
responses, an important component of ecosystem function 
(e.g., Pearse et al. 2017; Solbreck and Knape 2017). Our 
results from the non-chambered control plots demonstrate 
a positive relationship between shoot density and sexual 
reproductive effort for S. americanus (Fig. 2). The increase 
of sexual reproductive effort was mainly the result of an 
increase in the number of ramets that flowered. Studies of 
other species suggest that the relationship between sexual 
reproductive effort and density is variable. Winn and Pitelka 
(1981) suggested that increased shoot density would result 
in increased competition between ramets and decreased 
resource availability for seed production, a view supported 
by Newell and Tramer (1978) and Loehle (1987). In con-
trast, increased seed production at higher densities may 
be an adaptive trait in competitive environments as seed 
production and dispersal would enable species to escape 
from competitive crowding and colonize new environments 
(Abrahamson 1975, 1980; Winn and Pitelka 1981; Giroux 
and Bedard 1995). A feature of clonal species like S. ameri-
canus that would support increased seed production, even 
at higher densities, is division of labor (Roiloa et al. 2014), 
a process that enables physiologically connected ramets of 
clonal plants to share resources. In environments such as 
wetlands where clonal herbaceous species are often domi-
nant and where resources are spatially heterogeneous (e.g., 
Weiss et al. 2014; Dong et al. 2015), division of labor would 
enable ramets to secure resources that are locally available 
with ramets that may be rooted in areas where resources are 
less available. Ikegami (2004) demonstrated that division 
of labor occurs in S. americanus and that process may be 
partially responsible for the positive relationships between 
density in the non-chambered control plots and the two seed 
production variables in the ­CO2 experiment (Fig. 2B, C) 
as the sharing of resources can benefit a ramet that is in 
185

suboptimal conditions. If so, we would expect that more 
ramets in a population have the resources to flower than in 
the absence of division of labor, an outcome that is consist-
ent with our results.
In the experimental manipulations, we found that there is 
almost no positive relationship between shoot density and 
sexual reproductive effect under increased ­CO2, N addi-
tion, and modest warming (+ 1.7 °C) conditions. Seed pro-
duction has been predicted or shown to both increase and 
decrease in crops in response to higher ­CO2 (Ziska et al. 
2001; Allen et al. 2004; Lenka et al. 2017) and the same has 
been shown for native plants (Billings and Billings 1983; 
Zangerl and Bazzaz 1984; HilleRisLambers et al. 2009). For 
S. americanus, when shoot density is not considered, the 
lower means for all three variables in the elevated chambers 
(Elev in Fig. 3A–C) indicate that other unknown factors may 
limit seed production, especially the maturation of seeds. 
The number of potential seeds per flowering shoot were 
statistically the same for ambient and elevated chambers 
(Fig. 3B), but the mean ratio of mature to potential seeds 
was statistically lower in the elevated chambers, indicating 
that resources may limit seed maturation under elevated 
­CO2. Multiple studies also have shown that the productiv-
ity response of S. americanus to elevated ­CO2 is nitrogen 
limited. Langley and Megonigal (2010) showed that N addi-
tion enhanced the ­CO2 stimulation of plant productivity in 
the first year of the ­CO2 × N experiment. Lu et al. (2019) 
combined data from the ­CO2 × N and ­CO2 experiments and 
found that elevated ­CO2 acting alone caused the diameter 
and height of S. americanus shoots to decrease, a morpho-
logical response that was compensated for in terms of pri-
mary production by increased shoot density. They concluded 
that N limitation caused by elevated ­CO2 was responsible for 
the morphological changes as added N reversed the effects 
in the ­CO2 × N experiment. The N limitation caused produc-
tion of smaller individual stems at higher plant density (Lu 
et al. 2019) and may have restricted seed production at the 
higher density (Fig. 4A, D). Unfortunately, interpretation of 
the results from the ­CO2 × N experiment were complicated 
by the impacts of an insect outbreak across the GCReW 
area prior to time we sampled this site. A positive response 
between shoot density and the number of potential seeds 
per flowering shoot (Fig. 2E) and a significant decrease in 
the same variable when density was not considered indicate 
that ­CO2 and N decrease the potential for seed production. 
Resource limitations may have a negative impact of seed 
maturation (compare Fig. 3E, F), especially in response to 
increasing shoot densities (Fig. 4E–I).
Temperature has variable effects on seed production in 
crops and native species (Klady et al. 2011; Caignard et al. 
2017; Lenka et al. 2017; Lippmann et al. 2019). Our results 
demonstrate that temperature will impact sexual reproductive 
effort in S. americanus. Means for all three variables related 
to sexual reproductive effort were higher in the + 1.7, + 3.4, 
and + 5.1 °C treatments and the differences were significant 
for two of the variables (Fig. 3G–I). A comparison of the treat-
ment effects in all three experiments clearly demonstrate the 
importance of temperature. All three variables (Fig. 3J, K) 
were positive in the heated plots of the warming experiment 
compared to the ­CO2 and ­CO2 × N experiments and the same 
was observed when the number of potential and number of 
mature seeds per ­m2 were compared (Supplemental Fig. 2G, 
H). Data from the ­CO2 and ­CO2 × N experiments also provide 
evidence of a potential temperature effect on sexual repro-
ductive effort. Higher means for the three variables from the 
ambient treatment in the ­CO2 and ­CO2 × N experiments (Amb 
in Fig. 3A–F) versus the non-chambered control suggests a 
chamber effect that we interpret to be due to the cumulative 
effect of slightly higher temperatures in the ambient cham-
bers over many years. Temperature differences inside and 
outside of chambers have been reported for experiments that 
are not designed to evaluate temperature (Vanaja et al. 2006; 
Messerli et al. 2015), and Drake et al. (1989) reported tem-
peratures inside chambers in the ­CO2 experiment at GCReW 
to be 1–2 °C higher than outside temperatures. Noyce et al. 
(2019), using plant density as a variable in the calculation 
of net primary production, also found annual differences in 
response to the temperature treatments in the first three years 
of the SMARTX experiment. They showed that root-to-shoot 
allocation was changed depending on warming and suggested 
that modest warming (+ 1.7 °C) caused plant demand for N 
to outpace the soil N supply while extreme warming (+ 3.4 
and + 5.1 °C) caused the N supply to outpace plant N demand. 
In this study, there is no positive relationship between flower-
ing ratio and plant density in ambient chambers in the ­CO2 
and ­CO2 × N experiments, and at + 1.7 °C plots in the warm-
ing experiment. However, there was a positive relationship 
at the + 3.4 and + 5.1 °C plots in warming experiment. Seed 
production of S. americanus may be suppressed under mod-
est warming conditions but not be suppressed under extreme 
warming conditions.
Few studies have documented the effects of multiple 
factors on seed production. Miyagi et al. (2007) found that 
elevated ­CO2 increased seed production in eleven annual 
species but concluded that the response was limited by nitro-
gen availability. Osanai et al. (2017) examined the interact-
ing effects of elevated ­CO2 and temperature on cotton under 
variable soil conditions. They found, similar to this study, 
temperature and elevated ­CO2 had a positive impact on fruit 
production, but the temperature response was larger, and the 
two variables interacted through the effects on nutrient avail-
ability, especially nitrogen availability. However, increasing 
nutrient availability may not result in increased seed pro-
duction in nutrient-limited ecosystems. Molau and Shaver 
(1997) found that elevating temperatures increased sexual 
reproductive effort of Eriophorum vaginatum, a species in 
186

1 3
the Cyperaceae (similar to S. americanus) in open-topped 
chambers in arctic environments, but adding N and P to 
experimental plots had no effect on seed number.
In summary, results of this comparative study demonstrate 
that an important wetland clonal species produces more 
flowering ramets in response to increasing density and that 
increasing temperature has a positive effect on the allocation 
of resources to sexual reproduction. Globally, the results sug-
gest that clonal tidal wetland species will respond to changes 
in temperature by producing more seeds that will be dis-
persed to and colonize new sites created by rising sea levels. 
We also demonstrate that when other environmental factors 
­(CO2 and N) are considered, increased allocation of resources 
to sexual reproduction may not result in an increase in the 
production of more mature seeds, even though reproduc-
tive ramets may have produced more flowers (i.e., potential 
seeds). The results suggest that the adaptative reproductive 
strategy of S. americanus will be impacted by future climate 
changes. The study demonstrated that an increased allocation 
of resources to sexual reproduction but not the production of 
mature seeds, an important component of the species ecologi-
cal strategy (Ikegami et al. 2012). Future research on this spe-
cies and other important wetland clonal species should focus 
on experiments that include several levels of the environmen-
tal factors (especially ­CO2 and N). The design of the tempera-
ture experiment already provides the opportunity to deter-
mine if different temperatures influence sexual reproductive 
effort differently. The research should also consider studies 
of seed dispersal, similar to those conducted by Kudoh and 
Whigham (2001) as seedling growth and establishment and 
the ability of species to colonize suitable habitats will be an 
important aspect of wetlands in the future.
