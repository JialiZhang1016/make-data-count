Addition of aluminium, zinc and magnesium
hydrides to rhodium(III)†
Olga Ekkert,a Andrew J. P. White,a Harold Tomsb and Mark R. Crimmin*a
We report the addition of M–H bonds (M ¼ Al, Zn, Mg) to a Rh(III) intermediate generated from the reductive
elimination of triethylsilane from [Cp*Rh(H)2(SiEt3)2]. A series of new heterobimetallic complexes possessing
Rh–M bonds have been isolated and characterised by a number of spectroscopic (1H, 29Si, 13C, 103Rh NMR,
infrared, and X-ray diﬀraction) and computational techniques (NBO and QTAIM analysis). Experimental and
computational data are consistent with cleavage of the M–H bond upon addition to rhodium with formation
of new Rh–M and Rh–H bonds. Upon photolysis the Al analogue of this series undergoes a further
elimination reaction producing triethylsilane and a highly unusual Rh2Al2H4 containing cluster proposed
to contain an Al(I) bridging ligand.
Introduction
This paper concerns the addition of main group hydrides to a
transition metal complex. We have studied the addition of M–H
(M ¼ Al, Zn, Mg) bonds to a 16-electron Rh(III) fragment and
compared our data to literature in which B–H or Si–H bonds
add to the same species. We demonstrate that in combination
the transformations may be dened by a spectrum of reactivity
that lies between two extreme denitions: oxidative addition
and hydride transfer. We show that as electronegativity diﬀer-
ence between the M and H atoms increases, the description of
hydride
transfer
becomes
more
accurate
than
oxidative
addition.
The oxidative addition of element–hydrogen bonds to tran-
sition metal centres is a reaction of fundamental importance to
catalysis. Upon coordination of H2 to a transition metal, back-
bonding can result in a lengthening of the H–H bond and the
formation of stretched dihydrogen adducts in lieu of traditional
dihydrogen complexes.1,2 In the extreme, cleavage of the H–H
bond and oxidative addition to the metal centre can occur.3
While the coordination and oxidative addition of H–H, Si–H
and B–H bonds to transition metals continues to receive
considerable attention,3–5 only recently have heavier main group
hydrides begun to emerge as ligands for transition metal
complexes.6 For example, the coordination of Al–H bonds to
group 5, 6, 10 and 11 metals has now been reported.7–9 In the
majority of cases, these species represent classical s-complexes
with donation of the electron-pair to the transition metal and
retention of a signicant Al–H bond. In a single case, Aldridge
and co-workers have shown that stretching of Al–H bonds may
occur upon coordination to a cobalt carbonyl fragment derived
from [Co2(CO)8].8d Despite these ndings, little is known about
the activation of heavier main group hydrides at transition
metal
centres,
and
less
still
about
the
heterobimetallic
complexes that would result from hydride transfer from the
main group to the transition metal. Herein we report the
addition of M–H bonds (M ¼ Al, Zn, Mg) to a Rh(III) interme-
diate generated from the reductive elimination of triethylsilane
from [Cp*Rh(H)2(SiEt3)2].
Results and discussion
Hartwig and co-workers have shown that H–Bpin reacts with
[Cp*Rh(H)2(SiEt3)2] under thermal or photochemical condi-
tions to give the corresponding metal boryl complex by B–H
activation.10
In
line
with
these
ndings,
thermolysis
of
[Cp*Rh(H)2(SiEt3)2] in the presence of b-diketiminate stabilised
aluminium, magnesium or zinc hydrides in C6D6 solution led to
the formation of the corresponding heterobimetallic complexes
1–3 along with a single equiv. of triethylsilane (Scheme 1).11,12
Complexes 1–3 were isolated following crystallisation from n-
hexane or hexamethyldisiloxane at 35
C and have been
characterised by multinuclear NMR and infrared spectroscopy,
CHN analysis, and single crystal X-ray diﬀraction.13 1H NMR
experiments in toluene-d8 revealed that 1 demonstrates a broad
doublet at d ¼ 15.14 ppm (1JRh–H ¼ 40.2 ppm Hz, fwhm ¼ 13.2
Hz), while complexes 2 and 3 show sharp signals at d ¼ 14.28
(1JRh–H ¼ 34.6 Hz, fwhm ¼ 4.9 Hz) and 15.91 ppm (1JRh–H ¼
40.5 Hz, fwhm ¼ 4.9 Hz) respectively. For comparison the
hydride resonances of the starting material BDI1AlH2 are
observed at d ¼ 4.62 ppm (fwhm ¼ 170 Hz). The chemical shi,

signicant Rh–H coupling and small line broadening by 27Al
(100%, I ¼ 5/2) in 1 suggests that the hydrides are located on
rhodium with only a weak interaction with the main group
element (vide infra). The terminal aluminium hydride reso-
nance of 1 was located by VT NMR experiments (see ESI†).
Maitlis and co-workers have characterised [Cp*Rh(H)2-
(SiEt3)2] by neutron diﬀraction experiments and assigned it as a
Rh(V) complex.11a–b While Hartree–Fock calculations support
this
formulation,11c
subsequent
calculations
suggest
that
assignment of the +5 formal oxidation state may be misleading
due to the fact that the Si/H distance may be compressed with
very little energetic cost.11d 103Rh–1H HMBC experiments show
that this latter species (d ¼ 1709 ppm) has a similar magnetic
environment at rhodium to the heterobimetallic complexes we
have isolated (1, d ¼ 1570 ppm; 2, d ¼ 1743 ppm; 3, d ¼
1540 ppm). The absence of H/H bonding was supported by
long T1 relaxation times of the Rh–H resonances of 1–3 (T1 ¼
0.9–1.0 s). The lack of a strong M–H interaction was further
evidenced by infrared data on 1–3. The Rh–H stretches (1, 1966
cm1; 2, 1959 cm1; 3, 1929 cm1) are shied to slightly lower
energy relative to that in [Cp*Rh(H)2(SiEt3)2] (2019 cm1).11
Single crystal X-ray diﬀraction of samples of 1–3 conrmed
the assigned
structures. The
Rh–Al, Rh–Zn and Rh–Mg
distances are all within the sum of the covalent radii, taking
values of 2.4527(8), 2.4158(4) and 2.5049(8) ˚A respectively.14 For
comparison, whether hydride bridged or not, Rh–Zn distances
in multimetallic clusters range from 2.45–2.58 ˚A and are longer
than those found in 2.15,16 Similarly the Rh–Al bond length of 1 is
shorter than the Rh/Al interaction in [Cp*Rh(PMe3)2(Al2Me2Cl2)],
and is similar to that found in a Rh/Al heterobimetallic recently
isolated by our group.17,18 To the best of our knowledge, no
examples of crystallographically characterised complexes con-
taining a Mg–Rh bond exist. While the element–hydrogen bond
lengths should be treated with caution it is noteworthy that in
all cases the Rh–H bond lengths are short (1.42(3)–1.56(3) ˚A)
and the M–H distances are long (2.06(3)–2.17(3) ˚A). For
comparison the Al–H bond length of the terminal hydride in 1 is
1.65(2) ˚A (Fig. 1).
Two extreme bonding descriptions can be considered: a
neutral rhodium complex containing a Rh–M bond (A) and a
rhodiate complex in which a cationic main group fragment is
stabilised by coordination to a rhodium anion (B). Both
bonding descriptions are likely to be augmented by additional
non-classical M/H interactions. As a result the assignment of a
formal oxidation state has limited meaning. In order to verify
the position of the hydride atoms and to gain a deeper insight
into the bonding within the ground-state structures of 1–3 a
series of gas-phase DFT calculations were conducted. For
comparison, [Cp*Rh(H)2(Bpin)(SiEt3)] and [Cp*Rh(H)2(SiEt3)2]
were also analysed by DFT methods (Fig. 2and 3).
NBO calculations revealed that, while the Rh–M Wiberg
bond
indices
of
1,
2
and
3
are
lower
than
those
of
[Cp*Rh(H)2(SiEt3)2] and [Cp*Rh(H)2(Bpin)(SiEt3)], the Rh–H
WBIs are consistent across the series (Fig. 4, ESI†). Suggestive of
a weak interaction between the hydrides the main group
element, the M/H WBIs for the series range from 0.12 to 0.21.
The data are consistent with the aforementioned calculations
on [Cp*Rh(H)2(SiEt3)2] which demonstrate a low energy barrier
to hydride translation and formation of a weak Si/H bond. It

has also been concluded that [Cp*Rh(H)2(Bpin)(SiEt3)] contains
a weak B/H interaction as evidenced by the line-broadening of
the hydride resonances due to 1JB–H coupling.10 It is worth
noting
that

and
[CpRh(SiMe3)2(h2-HSiEt3)] have been formulated as s-silane
adducts based on the observation of signicant 1JSi–H coupling
constants > 20 Hz.11e,f
Our ndings were further underscored by quantum theory
atoms-in-molecules (QTAIM) calculations, which in all cases
reveal bond critical points (BCPs) between Rh and M, Rh and H
and not between M and H (Fig. 4, ESI†). The limitation of this
method in detecting very weak interactions has been high-
lighted previously and it remains likely that the partial M/H
bonds suggested by the NBO analysis and the spectroscopic
data are valid.19 The NPA charges on the bridging hydride atoms
are small throughout the series. While the charge on Rh is also
small for the B, Si and Al complexes it becomes signicant for
the Zn and Mg analogues taking values of 1.01 and 0.99
respectively (Fig. 4 and ESI†). In combination the experimental
and theoretical data suggest that the bonding description lies
between the two extremes of A and B. The rhodiate structure B
becoming more important for the Zn and Mg analogues of the
series and the neutral rhodium structure A more important for
the Si and B analogues of the series. The Al complex provides an
intermediate case. Broadly, the spectrum of reactivity may be
correlated
with
the
electronegativity
diﬀerence
between
hydrogen and the main group element: Dcp ¼ 0.16 (B), 0.30 (Si),
0.55 (Zn), 0.59 (Al), 0.89 (Mg).
To gain insight into the mechanism of bond activation and
to provide support for an elimination-addition process, addi-
tional DFT calculations were conducted. The reductive elimi-
nation of triethylsilane from [Cp*Rh(H)2(SiEt3)2] to form
[Cp*Rh(H)(SiEt3)] was found to be energetically accessible. A
transition state could not be located for this transformation.

maxima corresponding to a transition state. The addition of the
M–H bond to the resulting 16-electron intermediate was
calculated to be increasingly exergonic across the series Si  B <
Al  Zn < Mg (Fig. 4). While the current data cannot rule out an
associative type mechanism, such as s-complex assisted
metathesis or an interchange mechanism such as s-bond
metathesis,
without
invoking
ring-slippage
of
the
cyclo-
pentadienyl ligand, these pathways remain unlikely to originate
from
the
coordinatively
saturated
18-electron
complex
[Cp*Rh(H)2(SiEt3)2].
The calculations suggest the addition of Al–H, Zn–H and
Mg–H bonds to [Cp*Rh(H)(SiEt3)] may be non-reversible, while
the addition of Si–H and B–H bonds is reversible (Fig. 4). In line
with these ndings, Hartwig and co-workers have previously
demonstrated
that
[Cp*Rh(H)2(SiEt3)(Bpin)]
undergoes
competitive reductive elimination of both the silane, H–SiEt3,
and the borane, H–Bpin upon heating in the presence of
P(p-tol)3.10 While in the current case extended thermolysis of
1–3 led only to slow decomposition, photolysis of 1 for 6 h using
a 400 W Hg lamp gave clean formation of 42, a product resulting
from the selective elimination of H–SiEt3 from the hetero-
bimetallic precursor (Scheme 2). Complex 42 could also be
generated directly under the same conditions by photolysis of a
1 : 1 mixture of BDIAlH2 and [Cp*Rh(H)2(SiEt3)2].
In the solid-state 42 exists as a dimer of Rh–Al units forming
a Rh2Al2H4 core with a point of inversion at the centre of the
heterometallacycle (Fig. 5). Although still within the sum of the
covalent radii, the Rh–Al distances of 2.4973(7) and 2.5282(7) ˚A
are both longer than that found in 1. The long Al/H distances
of 1.99(3) and 2.07(3) ˚A and short Rh–H distances of 1.58(3) and
1.52(3) ˚A, suggest that, similar to 1, hydride transfer occurs
from Al to Rh. In this instance, no terminal hydride remains on
Al and two Rh–Al bonds are formed per Al centre. The hydrides
were located in the diﬀerence map and their position has been
veried by DFT calculations on a truncated model of 42 (see
ESI†). Infrared spectroscopy supports the formulation and a
Rh–H stretch is observed at 1988 cm1.
In solution the hydride resonances are observed as a doublet
at d ¼ 15.38 ppm (1JRh–H ¼ 44.2 Hz, fwhm ¼ 7.8 Hz). The 103Rh
NMR chemical shiof d ¼ 878 ppm is signicantly diﬀerent to
those found in the series 1–3 (vide supra) and is consistent with
an extreme change in the chemical and magnetic environment
at rhodium upon elimination of triethylsilane. A series of DOSY
experiments were conducted to probe the nuclearity of 42 in
solution. We have previously demonstrated that at 303 K in
toluene-d8 solution, monomeric b-diketiminate aluminium and
zinc hydrides possess diﬀusion coeﬃcients in the range 0.967–
0.944  109 m2 s1 (rsolution ¼ 4.1 ˚A) and that upon coordina-
tion to a copper(I) fragment the values decreases to 0.775  109
m2 s1 (rsolution ¼ 5.3 ˚A).8g In the current case, the diﬀusion
coeﬃcient of 42 of 0.591  109 m2 s1 in C6D6 at 298 K is
distinct from previous data and gives a solution hydrodynamic
radius (rsolution ¼ 6.2 ˚A) that is a similar magnitude to that
calculated for the Rh2Al2 structure from the solid state data
(rsolid ¼ 7.3 ˚A).20 The data support the retention of the tetra-
metallic unit in solution.
Triethylsilane elimination from 1 is expected to lead to a
monomeric heterobimetallic [Cp*Rh(H)2(AlBDI1)] (4), which
could be described as a Rh(III) complex supported by an Al(I)
ligand, or a Rh(I) complex with an h2;h2-bound aluminium
dihydride (see ESI, Fig. S22†). The formation of a strongly
s-donating BDI1Al: ligand within the coordination sphere of Rh
would be expected to generate an extremely electron rich
rhodium centre and dimerisation of 4 may occur by formation
of an additional donor–acceptor interaction from a lled d-
orbital on Rh to the partially vacant 3p-orbital on Al. Consistent
with this argument in the X-ray structure of 42 the diketiminate
ligands on Al pucker away from planarity and exist in a
conformation in which the orbital overlap between the lone-
pairs on nitrogen and the Al(3p) orbital would be disrupted.
Hence, we tentatively propose that the Al fragment in 42 acts as
an LZ-type ligand rather than an X2-type ligand and that the
monomeric unit 4 could be formulated with a terminal Al(I)
ligand (see ESI†).6
Aldridge and co-workers have provided computational data
to support a similar Al(I)/Co(III) formulation in the cationic
fragment of the cobalt complex [(OC)3Co(m-H)2AlBDI2][Co(CO)4].
This latter species also contains an additional donor–acceptor
interaction in the form of coordination of an oxygen based lone
pair from the anionic [Co(CO)4] unit to Al. Furthermore, the
generation of a gallium(I) ligand from the spontaneous

transition metal mediated dehydrogenation of a b-diketiminate
supported gallium dihydride has been reported by the same
group.8d,8e Two pathways could explain the generation of 4 from
1, either a 1,2-elimination of H–SiEt3 from across the Rh–Al
bond or reductive elimination of H–SiEt3 from the Rh metal
centre followed by a-migration of the terminal hydride on Al to
Rh. Based on the current data we cannot discriminate these
mechanisms.
Conclusions
We have demonstrated the addition of aluminium, zinc and
magnesium hydrides to a coordinatively unsaturated, 16-elec-
tron, Rh(III) complex [Cp*Rh(H)(SiEt3)]. The reaction results in
the cleavage of the M–H bond and the formation of a new Rh–M
and Rh–H bond. While parallels may be drawn with an oxidative
addition mechanism, only in the case of Al is this description
valid. For Zn–H and Mg–H calculations reveal considerable
charge localisation on rhodium and hence hydride transfer to
generate an ate complex is a more apt description of the reac-
tion. DFT calculations suggest that the addition of M–H (M ¼ Al,
Zn and Mg) bonds to the Rh(III) intermediate is non-reversible.
This latter hypothesis has been supported by initial reactivity
studies, which demonstrate the selective elimination of trie-
thylsilane from a rhodium complex containing ligands derived
from both a silane and an alane. We are continuing to study the
unusual heterobimetallics reported herein as catalysts and
reagents for diﬃcult bond transformations.
