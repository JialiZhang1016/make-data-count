Abstract
Introduction: Falls are an important adverse event among older adults. The St. Thomas’s Falls Risk 
Assessment Tool in Older Adults (STRATIFY) is a tool to assess the risk of falls; however, it is not translated 
and adapted to Portuguese. Objective: To translate and perform a cross-cultural adaptation of STRATIFY in 
Brazilian Portuguese, as well as to test the reliability and validity of the instrument. Method: The cross-cultural 
adaptation process was carried out in six stages: A) T1 and T2 translations; B) synthesis of translations (T12); 
C) T12 back translations (RT1 and RT2); D) expert committee review; E) pretesting of the version approved by 
the committee; F) adapted version of STRATIFY for Brazilian Portuguese. Inter-rater and test-retest reliability 
were performed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Validity 
was assessed by the Spearman’s correlation coefficient of the STRATIFY with the Morse Fall Scale (MFS). Data 
analysis was performed by the Microsoft Office Excel 2016 (translation and adaptation) and by the IBM SPSS

Statistics 20.0 (reliability and validity). We used a level of significance of p<0.05. Results: Data were presented 
about the perception of 33 health professionals on the adapted version of STRATIFY. The following ICC and CI 
were found for inter-rater and test-retest reliability, respectively: ICC=0.729; CI=0.525-0.845 and ICC=0.876; 
CI=0.781-0.929. STRATIFY and MFS showed a moderate but significant correlation (ρ=0.50, p<0.001). 
Conclusion: The translated and adapted version of the STRATIFY presented moderate inter-rater reliability 
and good test-retest reliability, in addition to a moderate correlation to the MFS.

Introduction
The occurrence of falls in older adults is a 
significant adverse event[1], which can lead to several 
complications for the individual, such as fractures, 
bruises, cranium traumas or even death [2-5]. In 
addition, falls are responsible for two-thirds of trauma 
deaths/injuries in older adults [6] and are considered 
the main cause of death related to trauma [7]. 
Because of these complications, the individual may 
present functional limitations and disabilities, such 
as hospitalizations, increased hospitalization time 
(if the patient is already hospitalized) or admission in 
nursing homes (NH) [8-10], as well as the worsening 
of the quality of life [11].
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) 
[12], about 28 to 35% of individuals over 65 years of 
age suffer a fall every year. In addition, approximately 
half of these older adults who have already suffered at 
least one fall are recurrent fallers [13]. In the hospital 
environment, studies indicate that the rate of falls in 
developed countries is three to five falls per 1,000 
patients per day. The rate varies according to the 
hospital unit and is higher in units that have a higher 
concentration of older patients [14].
Institutionalization and hospitalization, besides 
being factors related to the fall, may characterize a 
risk factor for falls [15, 16], since the patients are in 
a different environment than they are habituated, 
with the presence of a team of professionals to 
assist them in using medications or therapies that 
may affect the postural control [15, 17, 18]. Older 
adults in NH and in hospitals are more susceptible 
to functional dependence and frequently affected by 
chronic or acute conditions when compared with 
the older adults who live in the community [18, 19]. 
All of these factors differentiate hospitalized and 
residents in NH older adults from those who live 
in the community [14]. The WHO launched in 2004 
the World Alliance for Patient Safety, instituting fall 
prevention as the 6th International Safety Target [2]. 
In 2013, the Brazilian Ministry of Health, and the 
Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária (National 
Health Surveillance Agency) created the Programa 
Nacional de Segurança do Paciente (National Patient 
Safety Program) to improve patient safety assisted 
by the country’s health system [20].
The MS advises that the risk assessment should 
be used in the institution in order to track patients 
at risk and prevent the occurrence of falls. The 
Programa Nacional de Segurança do Paciente 
(National Patient Safety Program) recommends 
that the institution should employ an appropriate 
scale to the profile of its patients and perform the 
assessment at the time of admission and repeat it 
every day until discharge [20].
Many risk factors are related to the increased 
number of falls in a hospital environment, which has 
favored the creation of several instruments to assess 
the risk of falls, making clinical practice difficult to 
choose the appropriate instrument [21-30].
In an analytical review, Lee et al. [31] described 
several scales for assessing the risk of falling used 
in surgical and medical units. The scale found in 
eight validation studies was the St. Thomas’s Risk 
of Assessment Tool in Falling Elderly Inpatients 
(STRATIFY).
STRATIFY is a tool that evaluated five items: the 
medical record of falls, agitation, visual impairment, 
need to use the restroom frequently, transfer and 
mobility. For each item there is a “yes” or “no” question 
[21]. In addition, it is a scale of easy application and 
frequently used in Brazil [20, 32], but it is not adapted 
to the Portuguese language.
Several studies have used STRATIFY recently 
[33-40], some studies favoring the use of the 
instrument [21, 33], others with discussions about 
whether the instrument is suitable or not for some 
sectors [36, 38, 40].
Although there is much criticism in the literature 
for the use of STRATIFY, the instrument is widely 
used and recommended by the Brazilian Ministry of 
Health to be implemented in fall prevention programs 
for older adults [20].
Therefore, the objective of our study was to 
perform the transcultural translation and adaptation 
of the STRATIFY instrument to the Portuguese 
language (Brazil), as well as to test the reliability and 
validity of the instrument.
Methods
Before the translation and cross-cultural 
adaptation process of STRATIFY, we sent an e-mail 
to the STRATIFY’s author asking for his permission 
for all process. After permission was granted, the 
cross-cultural adaptation process occurs according 
to the guidelines by Beaton et al. [41]. Six steps were 
conducted, which can be observed in Figure 1. Follow 
the six detailed steps:

Figure 1 – Flowchart of the stages of the translation and 
cross-cultural adaptation process.
a)	 Translations (T1 and T2)
Two translations of STRATIFY were performed 
for the Brazilian Portuguese by two independent 
translators, who possessed semantic, conceptual and 
cultural knowledge of the English language. One of 
the translators knew about the basic objectives of the 
tool and was from the area of study on falls, but the 
other was not connected to the area. The translators 
were instructed to use simple language, which could 
be understood by the general population.
b)	 Synthesis of the translations (T12)
A third person met with the two translators 
(T1 and T2) and was responsible for resolving any 
discrepancies and organizing the consensus version 
of translations (T12).
c)	 Back Translations of T12 (RT1 and RT2)
Two native individuals from the country of the 
original STRATIFY were responsible to perform the 
back translation of T12. None of the back translators 
had knowledge about the topic covered by the 
evaluation tool (important to know whether the T12 
matched the original content).
d)	 Expert Committee
All the material generated in the previous 
stages (T1, T2, T12, RT1 and RT2) were 
submitted to an expert committee composed of 
all the participants already described, including a 
language professional, an experienced validation 
methodologist and a health professional. All 
the notes made in each step were taken to the 
committee, along with all the material produced, 
so that the pre-test version was produced. The pre-
test version should be understood by a 12-year-old 
child and be equivalent to the original instrument 
in four aspects: semantic, experimental, idiomatic 
and conceptual. The committee could modify or 
reject the format and items and add new items. 
Since the original STRATIFY has no instructions 
to the evaluators and depends entirely on their 
perception, instructions for the adapted version 
have been created in this step.
e)	 Pretesting of the version approved by the 
committee
As mentioned in the previous step, STRATIFY 
is an evaluation tool that depends on the 
evaluator’s observation. Thus, with the pre-test 
version established by the expert committee, the 
STRATIFY pre-test was performed with 33 health 
professionals (nurses and physiotherapists) who 
had at least 1 year of experience in Gerontology in 
Fisioter Mov. 2019;32:e003227

order to verify the understanding of the items of 
the tool. The health professionals were recruited 
from the researchers’ contacts and colleagues, and 
those who agreed to participate signed the Free and 
Informed Consent Form, approved by the Research 
Ethics Committee of the Medical School of the 
University of Sao Paulo (CEP-FMUSP) (number – 
1.818.309; CAAE – 53540716.3.0000.0065). The 
health professionals, who participated in the 
study, completed an assessment sheet about 
the pre-test version of the STRATIFY for clarity, 
comprehension and application (for each item on 
the STRATIFY, they should indicate “clear,” “partially 
clear” or “unclear” and justify their answers if they 
chose “partially clear” or “unclear”). If there was 
any doubt or difficulty about the application, the 
professional could propose sentences or terms more 
understandable and compatible with reality.
f)	 Adapted version of STRATIFY in Brazilian 
Portuguese
The suggestions made in the pretesting were taken 
to the expert committee again, who rediscovered 
the adapted version, reformulated the necessary 
items and defined the final version of the Brazilian 
Portuguese STRATIFY.
After the translation and adaptation process, the 
reliability and validity of STRATIFY were tested. Two 
physiotherapists attended a nonprofit NH, located 
in the south of the city of Sao Paulo, and applied the 
evaluation instrument to 50 older residents of the 
institution, who agreed to participate in the study 
and signed the consent form.
For the inter-rater reliability, on the same day, 
each physiotherapist performed an evaluation of 
STRATIFY with all the older adults, but independently 
and at different times, so that one was not aware of 
the other’s score. For test-retest reliability, all the 
older adults were evaluated again by one of the 
physiotherapists after two days. The order and 
conditions for the evaluation were the same as the 
first evaluation.
The Morse Fall Scale (MFS) was also applied to all 
study participants in order to verify the validity of 
STRATIFY. The MFS is a scale for assessing the risk 
of falls in inpatients, used by the nursing team at the 
admission of the patient. This scale was developed 
by Morse [42], originally published in English and 
adapted and validated for the Portuguese language 
by Urbanetto et al. [24]. It is easy to apply and 
simple in its six items of evaluation: Medical record 
of Falls, Secondary Diagnosis, Aid in Ambulation, 
Intravenous Therapy / Salinized or heparinized 
endovenous device, Gait and Mental State. Each item 
is scored from 0 to 30 points. The sum of all items 
constitutes a risk score for fall, with the following 
classification: low risk, from 0 to 24 points; medium 
risk, from 25 to 44 and high risk, equal to or greater 
than 45 points.
The characteristics of the sample, sex and age 
were presented by means of descriptive statistics, 
relative percentage for sex and measures of 
position and variability for age. The inter-rater 
and test-retest reliability were analyzed by the 
intraclass correlation coefficient [CCI(2,1)] [43, 44] 
and confidence interval (CI) of 95%. The inter-rater 
reliability was analyzed using the scores obtained 
by the two physiotherapists in the first evaluation, 
and the test-retest reliability was analyzed using 
the scores of a physiotherapist in the first and 
second evaluations. The ICC was interpreted as 
poor (< 0.5), moderate (0.5-0.75), good (0.75-0.9), 
or excellent (> 0.90) [45].
We used descriptive statistics analysis for data 
of the translation and cross-cultural adaptation of 
STRATIFY with the Microsoft Office Excel 2016 for 
Windows, Brazil. For data analysis of reliability and 
validity, we used the statistical software IBM SPSS 
Statistics for Windows, version 20.0 [46], adopting 
a level of significance of p < 0.05.

Table 1 shows the steps of the translation and 
cross-cultural adaptation process of the STRATFIY, 
until the development of the pre-test version.

admitted to the hospital due 
to a fall, or did he/she fall 
after admission?
RT2: Did the patient enter the 
hospital after suffering a fall, 
or did he/she fall during his/
her stay?
Expert 1: The translation is adequate, but 
when it comes to interpretation of what you 
are asking, I believe it would be worthwhile 
to put instructions of punctuation, for 
example: consider score 1 if the patient was 
referred to the hospital due to a fall (reason 
for hospitalization) or if due to the period of 
hospitalization (due to another reason without 
being fall) the patient fell.
Instruções para o avaliador: Analise o histórico 
do paciente ao ser admitido na unidade 
hospitalar. Ele deu entrada no Hospital devido 
à uma queda? Se sim, assinale a opção “sim”. 
Se não, considere se o paciente apresentou 
alguma queda durante todo o período de 
internação até o momento. Em caso afirmativo, 
assinale a opção “sim”.

RT1: Do you think the patient 
was visually impaired, to an 
extent that daily activities 
were affected?
RT2: Do you think the patient 
is visually compromised, 
to the extent day to day 
activities are affected? 
Expert 2: Here is the margin to interpret in 
two ways: The way the item is or: “Apresenta 
alteração visual que afeta as atividades diárias”; 
probably this item tries to evaluate if the patient 
has or not important visual impairment, since 
the visual system is directly related to the 
postural control.
Expert 3: “Está visualmente comprometido”: 
could be presented as “apresenta 
comprometimento visual”. I suggest this 
change because it is the closest expression of 
Portuguese within the health area – we want 
to know if the older adult presents problems 
and difficulties, if it is possible to perceive. 
In addition, the “ be” as “apresenta” is not 
uncommon. “À medida em que as atividades 
diárias são afetadas”: change by “a ponto 
de afetar as tarefas diárias”. As the original 
text is “to an extent that daily activities were 
affected?”, what the question seeks to 
investigate is the degree of commitment of the 
daily activities and not the commitment during 
the activities. In this case, the current translation 
can greatly modify the original concept.

o paciente apresenta comprometimento

ele apresenta alguma dificuldade em suas 
atividades diárias?

high risk of fall.
Expert 1: It is necessary instructions of 
punctuation.
Expert 2: Transfer score, change “ajuda grande’ 
for “muita ajuda”; change “auxílio físico” 
for “dispositivo auxiliar”; and change “ajuda 
pequena” for “pouca ajuda”.
Expert 3: “Grande ajuda”: change for “muita 
ajuda”. Considering the concept employed in 
this context and the natural way in which we 
use the word “ajuda” in Portuguese, when we 
refer to the amount of help, we use “muita”, 
and not “grande”. “Pequena ajuda”: change for 
“pouca ajuda”.
As in the previous comment, when we use the 
word “ajuda”, we use “pouca ajuda”.
Instruções para o avaliador: Observe como 
o paciente realiza transferências. Peça para 
ele se levantar da cama ou de uma cadeira. 
Utilize os critérios de avaliação da transferência 
para pontuar. Neste mesmo item, verifique a 
mobilidade do paciente: Ele anda sozinho? 
Necessita do auxílio de uma pessoa ou 
dispositivo auxiliar? Utiliza cadeira de rodas 
sozinho? É acamado? Considere a pontuação 
de mobilidade. Para pontuar o item 5, some as 
pontuações de transferência e mobilidade, se a 
pontuação for 3 ou 4, pontue 1 para o item 5, 
caso contrário, a pontuação para o item 5 é 0.

A total of 33 health professionals participated 
in the pre-test, 63.6% (n = 21) physiotherapists 
and 36.4% (n = 12) nurses, with 97% women 
(n = 32) and mean of age 33 ± 7 years. Table 2 
shows the data regarding the academic education, 
time of graduate and place of performance of the 
professionals participating in the pre-test.
Table 3 shows data on the clarity of each item 
of the STRATIFY pre-test version. Regarding the 
comments and suggestions of the final version, health 
professionals highlighted the following points for each 
item: Item 1 – better understanding when changing 
com queda for devido a uma queda; Item 2 – the 
criterion for determining what is stirred is unclear. Is 
the criterion for determining what is agitated related 
to symptoms and signs presented by the patient, or 
medical diagnosis, for example?; Item 3 – how to 
determine if the patient has visual impairment? By 
consulting the medical record? By asking the patient? 
Change apresenta alguma dificuldade em suas 
atividades diárias” for “apresenta alguma dificuldade 
para realizar atividades diárias; Item 4 – how to 
determine if the patient needs frequent bathroom 
visits? By consulting the medical record? By asking 
the patient?; Item 5 – leave punctuation instruction 
clearer, put the punctuation instructions after the 
item to be evaluated along with the explanation, show 
more clearly that the score of item 5 is the sum of the 
mobility and transfer score; Total Score – confusion 
of how to perform total score, confusion in classifying 
the patient at high risk of falling.

STRATIFY - Instrumento de avaliação do risco de queda
Este instrumento de avaliação foi desenvolvido para a identificação
de fatores de risco de quedas em pacientes hospitalizados. A pontuação
total pode ser usada para ajudar a identificar o risco de quedas em idosos.
Este instrumento de avaliação depende da OBSERVAÇÃO DO AVALIADOR 
em relação ao paciente. Para cada item, considere as instruções e orientações
para a pontuação deste instrumento.
1) O paciente deu entrada no Hospital devido a uma queda 
ou caiu durante a internação?
Instruções para o avaliador: Analise o histórico do paciente 
ao ser admitido na unidade hospitalar. Ele deu entrada no 
Hospital devido à uma queda? Se sim, assinale a opção “sim”. 
Se mão, verifique se o paciente apresentou alguma queda 
durante todo o período de internação até o momento. Se sim,
assinale a opção “sim”. Caso contrário, assinale “não”.
Você acha que o paciente (questões 2-5):
2) Está agitado?
Instruções para o avaliador: Analise, por meio da sua 
experiência clínica, se o paciente se encontra agitado no 
momento da avaliação.
3) Apresenta comprometimento visual, a ponto de afetar
as atividades diárias?
Instruções para o avaliador: Observe, de acordo com a sua 
experiência clínica, se o paciente apresenta comprometimento
visual. Por conta desse comprometimento, ele apresenta 
alguma dificuldade para realizar suas atividades de vida diárias?
4) Necessita de idas frequentes ao banheiro?
Instruções para o avaliador: Analise, de acordo com a sua 
experiência clínica, se o paciente necessita de idas 
frequentes ao banheiro.
5) Tem pontuações 3 ou 4 para transferência e mobilidade?
Instruções para o avaliador: Neste item você deverá verificar se o 
paciente tem pontuações 3 ou 4 para a SOMA da pontuação de 
transferência com a pontuação de mobilidade.
Para isso, avalie primeiramente a pontuação de transferência e 
mobilidade separadamente, para depois somá-las e assinalar
“sim” ou “não” para o item 5.
Para avaliar a TRANSFERÊNCIA, peça para ele se levantar da
cama ou de uma cadeira, observe e pontue de acordo com as 
opções abaixo:
0 = incapaz
1 = precisa de muita ajuda (uma ou duas pessoas, uso de 
dispositivo auxiliar)
2 = pouca ajuda (verbal ou física)
3 = independente
Para avaliar a MOBILIDADE,  verifique como o paciente
deambula. Ele anda sozinho? Necessita do auxílio de uma 
pessoa ou dispositivo auxiliar? Utiliza cadeira de rodas 
sozinho? É acamado? Pontue de acordo com as opções
abaixo:
0 = imóvel
1 = independente com auxílio de cadeira de rodas
2 = anda com auxílio de uma pessoa ou dispositivo auxiliar
3 = independente
Agora SOME as pontuações de transferência e mobilidade.
Se a SOMA for 3 ou 4, pontue 1 para o item 5, caso contrário
a pontuação para o item 5 é 0.
PONTUAÇÃO TOTAL DA STRATIFY: ____________________
Instruções para o avaliador: Para realizar a pontuação total do STRATIFY, some 
todas as respostas “sim” e assinale no local indicado acima. A pontuação final do
paciente deve ser entre 0 e 5. O risco de queda do paciente será classificado da 
seguinte forma:
0 = sem risco/risco baixo
1 = risco moderado
2 ou mais = risco alto
1          0
1          0
1          0
1          0
Sim     Não
Figure 2 – Final version of the STRATIFY translated and adapted to Portuguese.
For the reliability and validity analyses, a 
convenience sample of 50 older adults who live 
in NH participated in the study, 35 women (70%) 
and 15 men (30%), with a mean age of 79.5 years 
(SD ± 8.3 years). The interrater reliability of STRATIFY 
was considered moderate, with ICC = 0.729 (95% 
CI = 0.525-0.845). Test-retest reliability was good, 
with ICC = 0.876 (95% CI = 0.781-0.929). STRATIFY 
and MFS presented moderate but significant 
correlation (ρ = 0.50, p < 0.001).
Discussion
Throughout the process of translation and cross-
cultural adaptation of STRATIFY to the Brazilian 
Portuguese language, we found some details for 
modification and inclusion in the final version 
presented in this study. Overall, items translated and 
adapted were clear to health professionals, except 
for item 5, which generated more doubts among 
professionals (39.4% considered the item “partially 
clear” and 6.1% “unclear”).
In item 1, nine professionals did not consider clear 
the question O paciente deu entrada no Hospital com 
queda ou caiu durante a internação?, suggesting a 
change to O paciente deu entrada no Hospital devido 
a uma queda ou caiu durante a internação?. The 
term com queda was considered confusing, since the 
patient is admitted to the hospital because of a fall 
and not with a fall.
Regarding items 2, 3 and 4, some professionals 
questioned the criteria for determining whether a 
patient is agitated, if they have visual impairment, 
and frequently need to go to the bathroom. The 
justification for these questions was that the 
evaluation is very subjective, made according to the 
judgment of the professional. However, STRATIFY 
was developed to be an easy and agile application, 
Fisioter Mov. 2019;32:e003227

precisely considering only the perception of the 
professional in relation to the patient. Therefore, 
we chose to include an explanatory text before the 
evaluation instrument, with the information that the 
evaluation depends on the evaluator’s observation. 
In addition, we have included in the instructions that 
the evaluators should analyze the issues according 
to their clinical experience.
In item 5, many professionals questioned the text 
layout of the instructions and scores. Since STRATIFY 
has no instructions to the evaluator, in its original 
English version, we consider the creation of guidelines 
for professionals who will use the instrument in 
clinical practice important. With this, we assume that 
in the pre-test version the text could provide doubts 
to the evaluator. Therefore, we reformulated this item, 
describing it step by step, according to the observation 
necessary to the patient and scores. In the same way, 
we clearly put the instructions for the final score, since 
three professionals found it difficult to understand.
In this study, we performed the entire cross-cultural 
translation and adaptation process of STRATIFY and 
tested some psychometric properties through inter-
rater and test-retest reliability and validity of the 
assessment tool. We verified moderate inter-rater 
reliability and good test-retest reliability, as well as 
moderate and significant correlation of STRATIFY with 
MFS, showing that the instrument analyzed in this 
study may be applied to older adults who live in NH. 
However, future studies may assess the instrument’s 
ability to predict falls. In the literature, the variety 
of instruments for evaluating the risk of falling is 
enormous and many instruments do not have well 
established values of sensitivity and specificity to 
actually predict the occurrence of falls [31].
Similarly, Oliver et al. [14] warn of the use of 
evaluation tools that predict falls, since they do not 
have good sensitivity and specificity combined. In 
addition, they emphasize that falls involve a deeper 
study and that predicting them involves a specific 
judgment of the team of professionals involved 
in patient care, especially nurses (in the case of 
hospitalized patients). Oliver et al. [14] also confirm 
that one of the most used instruments in the literature 
to predict fall is STRATIFY.
Since STRATIFY depends on the judgment of the 
professional applying it, the variety of responses may 
be very large, which we could verify in this study, 
since the reliability of the inter-rater instrument was 
moderate, different from when the same evaluator 
reappears with the same subject at another time. 
In this case, the reliability is good, considering that 
the same person has a small variation of judgment 
between one evaluation and another.
In the literature, there are many options to 
evaluate the risk of falling, in addition to instruments 
based on the clinical judgment of the professional 
who evaluates the patient. Some of these options 
are the performance of postural control, such as the 
Berg Balance Scale [47] and the Balance Evaluation 
Systems Test (BESTest) [48], which evaluate the 
relationship of the motor part through balance and 
functional activities, as well as the interference of 
the cognitive task (present in BESTest). Future 
studies could compare the psychometric properties 
of subjective instruments with those of performance.
Although there is no consensus in the literature 
regarding the prediction of falls, as well as the lack of 
evidence regarding the sensitivity and specificity of 
the instruments, it is known that, in clinical practice, 
the use of these instruments is very common and 
recommended by fall prevention programs. In 
addition to using an appropriate assessment of the 
risk of falls for this purpose, hospital institutions are 
evaluated for the quality of the service provided, and 
falls prevention is a quality criterion.
Conclusion
We conclude the final version of STRATIFY adapted 
to Portuguese and to the Brazilian population after 
following the stages of translation and cross-cultural 
adaptation process. In addition, STRATIFY presented 
moderate and good inter-rater reliability and test-
retest, respectively. Regarding the validity of the 
instrument, this tool was moderately correlated to 
the Morse Fall Scale.
