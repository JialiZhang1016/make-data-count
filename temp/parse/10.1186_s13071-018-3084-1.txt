Abstract
Background: In Brazil, visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a serious public health problem because of its magnitude,
geographical expansion and potential harms caused by illnesses, including death. However, VL is largely ignored in
discussions of tropical disease priorities. Thus, this study aimed to identify factors associated with the expansion of
VL and the dispersion of its vector, Lutzomyia longipalpis, in the municipalities of the State of São Paulo, Brazil.
Methods: Information about the date of vector detection and the confirmation of autochthonous VL occurrence in
humans and canines in São Paulo were obtained between 1997 and 2014. Survival curves were calculated by the
Kaplan-Meier and the Cox multiple regression models was used.
Results: The presence of the Marechal Rondon highway showed the highest positive association with vector
dispersion and canine and human VL expansion. The monthly maximum and minimum temperature averages
recorded in the municipalities during the study period were also positively associated with these events. The
presence of transverse highways was positively associated with the presence of the vector; the border with the
State of Mato Grosso do Sul, the presence of a prison, microregion headquarters, and the presence of the Tietê
River were positively associated with the occurrence of canine cases, while only the presence of prison was
positively associated with the occurrence of human cases. The construction of the Bolivia-Brazil gas pipeline was
not associated with any events.
Conclusions: Survival analysis enabled the identification of factors associated with vector dispersion and VL
expansion, thus the results of this study may be useful to the improvement of VL surveillance and control activities
in the State of São Paulo and throughout Brazil.

Background
Leishmaniasis is one of the most neglected tropical dis-
eases that affects people worldwide, and visceral leish-
maniasis (VL), one of its forms, can cause mortality
when not properly treated [1]. Yet, even with treatment
access, 10–20% of VL cases result in death [2]. Globally,
an estimated 200,000–400,000 new cases of VL occur
per year, with more than 90% of the cases concentrated
in India, Nepal, Sudan, Bangladesh and Brazil [3, 4]. In
Latin America, VL has been reported in 12 countries
and Brazil has been responsible for approximately 96%
of the reported cases [5]. In Brazil, VL is a serious public
health problem because of its magnitude, geographical
expansion and potential to cause serious health illnesses.
Initially, the occurrence of VL was restricted to rural
areas, but the adaptation of its main vector, Lutzomyia
longipalpis (Lutz & Neiva, 1912), to anthropogenic

environments allowed VL to reach urban areas of Brazil-
ian cities [6]. In addition, the main reservoir of VL is the
domestic dog, which facilitates its dispersion through
these urban areas. Despite these known issues, VL is
largely ignored in discussions of tropical disease prior-
ities [7, 8].
Authors have associated the dispersion of the vector
and the geographical expansion of VL with the destruc-
tion or modification of natural environments, irregular
occupation of areas, lack of basic sanitation, poverty, big
constructions and migratory flow, among other factors
[6, 9–15]. For example, studies in the states of Mato
Grosso do Sul [11] and São Paulo (SP) [16] indicated the
role of the BR-262 and Marechal Rondon highways (the
first one crosses the state of Mato Grosso do Sul from
the Bolivian border to the SP border and the second one
is its continuation in SP) and the construction of the
Bolivia-Brazil gas pipeline in the expansion of human
VL in Brazil. The association of human VL and the gas
pipeline is presumed to be related to the movement and
migration of a large number of construction workers
[11], while the association with large highways is pre-
sumed to be related to their construction and expansion,
facilitating the movement and migration of people and
animals, including those affected by canine or human
VL [9, 11, 13–17]. Oliveira et al. [18] showed that the
dispersion of Lu. longipalpis in the northwest region of
SP has been through neighborhoods of the municipal-
ities and highlighted the role of the roads between them.
In 1997, the first record of a vector presence in a SP
urban area was in Araçatuba [19], which was followed by
the first report of an autochthonous case of canine VL in
1998 and an autochthonous case of human VL in 1999 in
the same city. From Araçatuba, vector and VL distribution
expanded along a main axis in the northwest-southeast
direction and, from here, the distribution expanded in
north and south directions [10, 16, 20].
Other factors related to migratory flow that could be
related to the dispersion of the vector and the expansion
of the disease in SP are the presence of the Euclides da
Cunha highway [18], proximity to the Mato Grosso do
Sul and Minas Gerais currencies [10, 16, 21, 22], pres-
ence of the Tietê River [23] and presence of prisons;
however, there is no known association between the
presence of prisons and VL dispersion and occurrence
in the literature. In the current context of Brazilian
prisons, the institutions have been identified as triggers
of population movement and migration [24, 25]. The
connection of the Tietê River to the dispersion and oc-
currence of VL could be related to the fact that it is a
waterway and natural recreational area, which facilitates
the movement of people.
In addition, climatic conditions must be considered, as
these factors would have a major influence on Lu.
longipalpis and, consequently, on the occurrence of dis-
ease in dogs and humans. Several studies have reported
an association between temperature, humidity, and pre-
cipitation and vector distribution [14, 15, 26–28], as well
as with the distribution of canine and human VL [15].
To better understand the dynamics and underlying
mechanisms of Lu. longipalpis dispersion and VL expan-
sion in SP, this study aimed to describe these phenom-
ena and evaluate their relationship with associated
factors, especially those that have been cited in the lit-
erature. The clarification of these relationships has the
potential to improve the surveillance and control activ-
ities of VL, both in SP and in other regions of the
country.
Methods
Study design and area
We developed a longitudinal study using survival ana-
lysis. The study area compromised 645 municipalities in
the State of SP, with a population of 41,252,160 inhabi-
tants, as of 2010, that were grouped into 15 mesoregions
and 63 microregions (Fig. 1) [29]. Despite our informa-
tion being groupings (the municipalities), they were
treated as individuals, justifying the choice of a longitu-
dinal study.
Data source and variables
Secondary data from VL cases in humans and autoch-
thonous canines as and on the presence of the vector
between 1997 and 2014 were obtained from two organi-
zations belonging to the State Department of Health of
the State of São Paulo: the Superintendency of Control
of Endemics and the Center for Epidemiological Surveil-
lance Professor Alexandre Vranjac. Information regard-
ing the six municipalities that reported the presence of
the vector prior to this period was obtained from the lit-
erature [10, 20, 30, 31]. Based on these data sources, the
following dependent variables were obtained, with values
for each of the 645 municipalities: dates (month and
year) of registration of the presence of the vector, the
first registration of a canine autochthonous case and hu-
man case. For the six municipalities with vector detec-
tion prior to 1997, the beginning of the study period was
adopted as the detection date. If the month of vector de-
tection and confirmation of a canine or autochthonous
human case was not available, these events were consid-
ered to occur in the middle of the year (June). The
present study did not include maps of vector dispersion
or of the expansion of VL canine and human cases be-
cause Casanova et al. [10] previously reported and illus-
trated both of these maps, as well as a map of the
expansion of the arthropod vector in SP.
In the present study, the independent variables, for
which values were obtained from each of the 645

municipalities of SP, were considered to be the following:
the microregion headquarters; the presence of the Mare-
chal Rondon and Euclides da Cunha highways (radial
highways); the presence of transverse highways; the pres-
ence of the Tietê River, the border of the states of Mato
Grosso do Sul and Minas Gerais; the presence of a
prison;
the

Development
Index
(MHDI); and the simultaneous or non-simultaneous oc-
currence of the construction of the Bolivia-Brazil gas
pipeline in relation to the presence of the vector and the
disease in dogs and humans. This last covariable was
considered as a simultaneous occurrence if the detection
of the vector occurred during the construction period or
within one year of its completion in a given municipality.
The same criterion was used to define the simultaneous
occurrence of the construction and the detection of the
first canine case and the first autochthonous human
case. Regarding the classification of the highways, a

radial highway was considered to be a route that con-
nected the municipalities in the direction of the capital
(the Marechal Rondon and Euclides da Cunha high-
ways). Roads between municipalities that did not lead to
the capital were considered transversal, which, in gen-
eral, are secondary roads with less importance than the
radial highways.
The information about the Bolivia-Brazil gas pipeline
was provided by the Brazilian Gasbol Transporter (TBG)
[32], and the present study only considered the north
section of the pipeline that occurs within SP (from the
municipality of Cosmópolis to the municipality of Casti-
lho). Demographic, environmental, socioeconomic and
geographical data on the municipalities were obtained
from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics
and the Foundation State System of Data Analysis. Infor-
mation about the highways and duplication works was
provided by the São Paulo Roads Department.
Information about the presence of prisons was ob-
tained from the website of the Prison Administration
Service of São Paulo. Information regarding the Tiete
River was obtained from the Integrated System of Water
Resources Management of São Paulo.
Independent variables representative of the climatic
conditions of the municipalities were also considered.
This information was obtained from the Integrated Cen-
ter for Agrometeorological Information of the Secretar-
iat of Agriculture and Supply of the State of São Paulo,
which
provides
daily
information
on
maximum
temperature, minimum temperature and precipitation
levels recorded by a network of meteorological stations
located in municipalities representative of all microre-
gions of SP. The following information was considered
from 109 municipalities that had at least 10 years of
monthly
information
documented
within
the
study
period (1997 to 2014): monthly averages of maximum
and minimum daily temperatures; total monthly precipi-
tation; and number of rainy days per month.
Statistical analysis
Once climatic information was obtained, the following
factors were calculated for each of the 109 municipalities
across the entire study period: the average monthly max-
imum
temperature;
the
average
monthly
minimum
temperature; the average monthly precipitation level;
and the average number of rainy days per month. These
values were georeferenced to the centroids of the 109
municipalities. For each of these variables, semivario-
grams were constructed that modeled the spatial de-
pendence of this data and provided the weights used in
the statistical interpolations or kriging. This allowed the
construction of thematic maps with information on
these variables for the entire study area. These proce-
dures were performed in the geoR package [33] from R
software [34]. With these maps, interpolated values for
these four climatic variables were obtained for each of
the centroids of the 645 municipalities of SP using the
nearest neighbor tool of the QGIS program [35].
The survival analysis method was used to evaluate the
time between onset of surveillance and the outcome
(vector, canine and human autochthonous case appear-
ance). The probabilities of appearance of the vector, ca-
nine case, and human case were calculated at 2, 5, 10
and 15 years. Survival curves were constructed by the
Kaplan-Meier method for the independent variables and
compared by the log-rank test. The univariate and mul-
tiple Cox regression model was used to calculate the
hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
In the construction of the multiple Cox regression
model, the stepwise backward method was used, in
which variables with a descriptive level (P) less than 0.20
in the univariate analysis were considered as candidates
for the multiple model. In the final model, only variables
with a descriptive level (P) less than 0.05 were consid-
ered. All analyses were performed in the statistical soft-
ware
SPSS
for Windows
v. 18,
and
the
level
of
significance was 5%.
Results
Of the 173 SP municipalities with a documented pres-
ence of the vector, four (2.4%) did not have information
about the month of detection, only the year. Of the 84
municipalities that reported autochthonous cases of hu-
man VL and the 108 municipalities that reported au-
tochthonous cases of canine VL, three (3.6%) and 51
(47.2%), respectively, only had information about the
year of first notification. In these cases, June was
assigned as the month of detection or notification (mid-
point of the year).
The probability of survival in 2, 5, 10 and 15 years for
the presence of the vector, human cases and autoch-
thonous canine cases are presented in Table 1. In the
context of this analysis, the survival probabilities for the
three considered outcomes are understood, respectively,
as the probabilities of a given municipality to not present
the vector, the canine case, and the human case after a
certain period of time.
The database with all information for each of the 645
municipalities of SP is also presented (Additional file 1:
Table S1), and the database contains information about
the three dependent variables related to the vector and
the disease in dogs and humans, their respective mesore-
gions and microregions (Fig. 1), and the values of all
covariables considered in the analysis. Regarding the 173
with reported vector presented, 108 municipalities with
reported canine VL presence, and 84 municipalities with
human VL presence, 148 municipalities (85.5%), 101
municipalities (93.5%), and 84 municipalities (100%),

respectively, were located in the western region of SP
(Fig. 1, Additional file 1: Table S1).
In Additional file 2: Table S2 the information provided
by TBG [32] regarding the municipalities of SP where
the northern section of the gas pipeline crosses, the
construction starts dates and the respective classifica-
tion of the simultaneous or non-simultaneous con-
struction
in
relation
to
the
vector
presence
and
disease in dogs and humans is presented. The con-
struction began in Cosmopolis (November 1997) and
ended in Castilho on the border with Mato Grosso
do Sul (February 1999).
The results of kriging of the climatic variable for SP in
the period of study are presented in Additional file 3:
Figure S1 (average monthly maximum temperatures),
Additional file 4: Figure S2 (average monthly minimum
temperatures) and Additional file 5: Figure S3 (average
monthly precipitation levels). These maps show that the
western part of SP is hottest and driest of SP. Moreover,
many of municipalities that borders the states of Minas
Gerais and Mato Grosso do Sul or are close to them are
the hottest and driest in the western region of SP.

cases in the municipalities of SP. In relation to the ad-
justed results, the presence of the Marechal Rondon
highway showed the highest positive association with the
three factors, with minimum temperature being second
and maximum temperature being third.
The presence of transverse highways was positively as-
sociated with the presence of the vector; the Mato
Grosso do Sul border, the presence of a prison, the
microregion headquarters, and the presence of the Tietê
River were positively associated with the presence of ca-
nine cases; however, only the presence of a prison was
positively associated with the presence of a human cases.
Precipitation was positively associated with the presence
of canine and human cases in the municipalities, while
the number of rainy days was negatively associated with
the presence of canine and human cases. Figures 2, 3
and 4 show the survival curves for the detection of the
vector, canine cases, and human cases, respectively, and
each of the categorical independent variables associated
in the Cox regression model.
Discussion
Association with highways
The present study, using the survival analysis technique,
showed that the presence of the Marechal Rondon high-
way was the variable most strongly associated with the
vector presence and occurrence of canine and human
VL cases in the municipalities of SP. Similarly, other
studies have indicated that both vector dispersion and
VL expansion in SP occurred along the route of this
highway [10, 16, 20, 21]. Sevá et al. [15] statistically
tested this hypothesis, but found a significant association
only between the presence of canine VL cases in a given
municipality and its distance to the Marechal Rondon
highway. This association may be related to the fact that
this highway is a channel that facilitates the transporta-
tion and migration of people and animals, including in-
dividuals and animals who are seropositive or have VL
[9, 11, 13, 14, 17]. In Brazil, the migratory flow and cir-
culation of people and animals occurs predominantly
highway travel, thus highways play an important role in
the spread of diseases [12, 13].
In addition to the presence of the Marechal Rondon
highway, the dispersion of the vector was associated with
the entire network of transverse highways in SP; how-
ever, this association was not observed for the dispersion
of canine and human VL cases. A study conducted in
the SP region of São José do Rio Preto revealed that the
dispersion of Lu. longipalpis has been through neighbor-
hood between municipalities that are usually connected
by neighboring roads, which are the most frequent type
of transverse highways in SP [18]. This observation is
most likely explained by the mechanisms through which
the vector is spread. One potential method of dispersion
is through the transport of contaminated materials, such
as soil, grass and chicken feces, across small to medium
distances [6]. Another way would be the dispersion of
adult Lu. longipalpis through motor vehicles [12].
Association with the states that border SP
The present study identified the border of Mato Grosso
do Sul as one of the factors associated with the expan-
sion of canine VL in SP and this association may also be
related to the fact that the Marechal Rondon highway is
a continuation of BR-262 in SP. Even though the border
with this state was not associated with the dispersion of

Lu. longipalpis and the expansion of human VL in SP,
several studies have indicated this state as the origin of
VL in SP [10, 15, 16, 21, 22, 36].
Casanova et al. [36] found that Lu. longipalpis from
Araçatuba, located in the western part of SP, produces
the (S)-9- methylgermacrene-B pheromone and Lu. long-
ipalpis from Espirito Santo do Pinhal, in the eastearn
part of SP, produces the cembrene-1 pheromone. In a
more recent study, Casanova et al. [10] found that the
(S)-9-methylgermacrene-B population of this vector is
widely distributed in the western part of SP and the
cembrene-1 population is restricted to the eastern part
of SP. They also showed that the expansion of VL in SP
has followed only the dispersion of the (S)-9-methylger-
macrene-B population.
It is worth noting that Bray et al. [37, 38] showed that
the pheromone of Lu. longipalpis from Campo Grande,
the
capital
of
Mato
Grosso
do
Sul,
was
also
characterized as (S)-9-methylgermacrene-B. Motoie et
al. [22] studied the genetic characteristics of Leishmania
infantum from SP using multilocus microsatellite typing
and concluded that this analysis is in agreement with the
hypothesis of the introduction of CVL in the western re-
gion of SP be due to the movement of dogs and humans
from the State of Mato Grosso do Sul.
Association with gas pipeline construction
A primary motivation of the present study was to test
the hypothesis proposed by Cardim et al. [16], who
based their hypothesis on the study by Correa-Antonialli
et al. [11], that the construction of the gas pipeline con-
tributed to the dispersion of Lu. longipalpis and expan-
sion of canine and human VL cases in SP. Sevá et al.
[15] tested this hypothesis and identified a statistically
significant relationship between the vector presence in a
municipality and its distance to the gas pipeline, a

marginally significant relationship between this distance
and the human VL presence, and no significant relation-
ship between the gas pipeline and canine VL presence;
the authors of this study considered these results to be
inconsistent [15].
A possible explanation for this inconsistency could be
the high collinearity between the distance of the munici-
palities to the gas pipeline and to the Marechal Rondon
highway, which both have similar paths and are spatially
close [32]. In the present study, this situation was avoided
by considering the presence of the highway and not its
distance and by not only considering the presence of the
gas pipeline in the municipality, but also assuming that
the gas pipeline could influence the vector dispersion and
expansion of the VL only during the period of construc-
tion development or within one year of its completion.
The model of the present study, in contrast to the re-
sults of previous studies [11, 15, 16], did not detect any
relationship between the gas pipeline and the vector dis-
persion and VL expansion, which could be related to the
differences in the construction of the Bolivia-Brazil gas
pipeline in Mato Grosso do Sul and the SP states. For
the gas pipeline constructed in Mato Grosso do Sul, the
construction occurred between 1998 and 1999 and the
work moved west-to-east, which followed the same tra-
jectory of the expansion of the human VL cases [11].
For the gas pipeline constructed in SP, the construction
of the northern section started in 1997 in the Cosmop-
olis, Campinas region, and was completed in 1999 in
Castilho [32], which advanced east-to-west and was
therefore inversely related to the vector dispersion path
and VL expansion trajectory in SP (Additional file 2:
Table S2) [10, 15, 16, 20].
Comparisons between the gas pipeline construction
and the vector dispersion and VL expansion in SP sug-
gest that the results of the present study are plausible. In
the mesoregion of Araçatuba, the construction of the
gas pipeline began in July 1998 and the vector had
already been detected in Araçatuba for more than a year
(April 1997). A similar situation occurred in the Andra-
dina microregion. The first autochthonous canine case
in Araçatuba had already been detected six months prior
to the start of the gas pipeline construction (February
1998) (Additional file 2: Table S2). Regarding the associ-
ation between the gas pipeline construction and the ex-
pansion of the human VL cases, only two municipalities
(Araçatuba and Birigui) reported the presence of cases
during the gas pipeline construction period or within
one year of its completion (Additional file 2: Table S2).
In principle, these results weaken the association be-
tween the construction of the gas pipeline and the
spread of the vector and disease; however, the results do
not rule out the possibility. Additional studies are
needed to better evaluate this hypothesis.
Association with presence of prisons
The association between the presence of municipality
prisons and the appearance of autochthonous canine
and human VL cases emphasizes the role of the people
and animal migration in the dispersion of VL [9, 11–14].
In 2013, Brazil had more than 500,000 prisoners, with
approximately 40% of this total population residing in
SP and, in order to deal with this surplus demand, the
State decided at the end of the 1990’s to build large
prisons in the interior of the State. From then on, espe-
cially between 1998 and the middle of the following
Fig. 4 Survival curves and human cases of VL. Emergence of human cases of VL and the two associated categorical variables (the Marechal
Rondon highway and presence of a prison) from 1999 to 2014. Data for the municipalities of São Paulo, Brazil

decade, the number of prisons in SP increased consider-
ably, so that most of the prison units in Brazil are now
located in SP [25]. This growth occurred in small and
medium-sized cities, especially in the western region of
SP [24]. Since the prisoners serve their sentences in mu-
nicipalities different from their origins, the families of
the prisoners often move to visit them mainly on the
weekends, constituting themselves to floating popula-
tions. In addition, if these relatives choose to stay in the
municipality, some of these populations may be charac-
terized by temporary migrants [24, 25].
Given
the
presented
information,
specifically
the
period of greatest increase in the number of prisons (late
1990’s and mid-2000’s) and the region with the largest
number of new prisons (western region of SP), the asso-
ciation between the presence of prisons and canine and
human VL case dispersion observed in this study is sup-
ported. In our study this variable “presence of prisons”
should be understood as indicative of migration and flow
of people, which is a factor known to be responsible for
the increase in the number of VL cases [9, 11–14]. In
addition, one can infer that these population movements
also include animals involved in the transmission cycle,
and that these populations tend to settle in precarious
places that are propitious for vector development and
occurrence of VL [14, 39]. However, this hypothesis, first
raised by the present study, should be further investi-
gated through future studies to better evaluate its
pertinence.
Association with environmental variables
The positive association between mean maximum and
minimum annual temperatures and the presence of the
vector in the municipalities reflects the fact that most of
municipalities are located in the western region of SP,
which is characterized by the highest maximum and
minimum temperatures in the state [40]. This result is
consistent with other studies [14, 15, 26, 41]. Regarding
rainfall, some studies have indicated that there is an in-
crease in vector density during the rainy season [28, 41–
43], and other studies have shown an increase in density
after the rainy season or after peak rainfall [44–47]. This
association could be explained by the hypothesis raised
by Rutledge & Ellenwood [48] that moderate levels of
rain during the rainy season increases the density of
sandflies, but that excess rainfall (with flooding of soil
and destruction of breeding sites) would decrease the
density of sandflies. The lack of association between pre-
cipitation and vector presence in the present study could
be attributed to the fact that the study did not consider
the density of the vector, but rather its presence.
In
relation
to
the
positive
associations
between
temperature and occurrence of canine VL cases, which
was also detected by Sevá et al. [15], and human VL
cases, which was also detected by Almeida et al. [26],
these could be understood as a consequence of the asso-
ciation of the vector with this variable. The positive as-
sociation between canine and human VL cases with
rainfall and the negative association with rainy days
could also be a reflection of factors related to vector
density.
A question that could be raised is whether the associ-
ation of Marechal Rondon highway with the dispersion
of the vector and expansion of VL is SP would be a re-
sult dependent on environmental variables. First, this re-
sult was adjusted by climatic factors (maximum and
minimum temperature and precipitation level). Also, the
hottest and driest part of SP borders the states of Minas
Gerais and Mato Grosso do Sul. Secondly, other high-
ways crossing the western region of SP from these states,
and not only Marechal Rondon, could be a vehicle for
the entrance and dispersion of the vector and the disease
in SP.
Association with other variables
Among the covariates considered in the analysis, the
MHDI, composed by longevity, education and income,
represents the living conditions of the residents of the
municipalities, a factor known to be associated with the
occurrence of VL. However, the results of the present
study indicated no correlation between MHDI and vec-
tor presence or canine and human cases, and this is par-
tially supported by the results obtained by Sevá et al.
[15]. In contrast, Oliveira et al. [20] showed that, in the
period from 1998 to 2014, the headquarters of micro-
regions played an important role in the expansion of
canine and human VL cases because approximately
75% of the autochthonous cases were first detected in
these regions. The reasons for this association could
be attributed to the fact that these regions are consid-
ered to be economic, educational and health centers,
which attract a greater movement of people. The as-
sociation of the Tietê River with the occurrence of
canine VL cases would also fit into this category be-
cause the river is a travel route and leisure area for a
large number of people.
The methodological highlight of the present study was
the use of survival analysis, a statistical tool often used
in observational oncology and cohort studies, but having
not documented use in literature for a study of this kind.
Survival analysis can be used to evaluate the relationship
of a variable of interest or dependent variable and a
given event in relation to a certain time period or oc-
currence [49]. Among the various methodological op-
tions available, the Kaplan-Meier method was selected
for this study because it does not use fixed time in-
tervals, but rather is determined by the occurrence of
the event, and the Cox regression model was used
Oliveira et al. Parasites & Vectors  (2018) 11:503 
Page 9 of 12
because there was interest in studying the impact of
some risk factors during the time until the occurrence
of the event of interest [49].
Limitations
The present study has limitations. First the study used
secondary data regarding the date of vector detection in
the municipality or of canine and human autochthonous
VL cases. The date of vector detection was biased by op-
erational issues because collections were not conducted
throughout the year. For the detection of canine cases,
there was uncertainty regarding the month of confirm-
ation of the first autochthonous case in a large number
of municipalities. As for the detection of the human
cases, problems related to underreporting may have de-
layed the detection of the first autochthonous cases. As
these limitations are more related to the month of oc-
currence of these phenomena, the early detection sys-
tems of the vector and the diseases in dogs have good
sensitivities [20]. Secondly, human VL is a compulsory
notification disease; therefore, it can be affirmed that
there was precision in relation to the years of occurrence
of the studied phenomena. The fact we did not take into
account information about the presence of Lu. longipal-
pis and the occurrence of CVL and HVL in the munici-
palities of the states that border with SP is also a
limitation of our study.
Conclusions
The presence of the Marechal Rondon highway in the
municipalities was the factor most strongly associated
with the dispersion of Lu. longipalpis and the expansion
of canine and human VL cases in SP. The average mean
maximum and minimum monthly temperatures were
also positively associated with the three phenomena.
The presence of transverse highways was positively asso-
ciated with the presence of the vector; the Mato Grosso
do Sul border, the presence of a prison, the microregion
headquarters, and the presence of the Tietê River were
positively associated with the presence of canine cases;
and the presence of some prisons was positively associ-
ated with the presence of human cases. The construc-
tion
of
the
Bolivia-Brazil
gas
pipeline
in
the
municipalities was not associated with the three events
studied. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study to identify an association between the presence of
a prison and vector and VL dispersion, which is believed
to be attributed to the temporary migration of the fam-
ilies of the prisoners; however, future studies are needed
to further elucidate this relationship. In addition, the use
of survival analysis in this study was critical to the iden-
tification of factors associated with vector dispersion and
disease spread. These results can be useful in the im-
provement of surveillance and control activities of VL.
