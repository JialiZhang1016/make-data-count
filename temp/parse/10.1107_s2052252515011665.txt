The crystallization behavior of methylthio- or methylsulfonyl-containing spacer
extended Z,Z-bis-ene–yne molecules capped with trimethylsilyl groups obtained
by (tandem) thiophene ring fragmentation and of two non-spacer extended
analogs were investigated. The rigid and linear molecules generally crystallized
in layers whereby the ﬂexibility of the layer interfaces formed by the silyl groups
leads to a remarkably rich crystal chemistry. The molecules with benzene and
thiophene spacers both crystallized with C2/c symmetry and can be considered
as merotypes. Increasing the steric bulk of the core by introduction of
ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) gave a structure incommensurately modu-
lated in the [010] direction. Further increase of steric demand in the case of a
dimethoxythiophene restored periodicity along [010] but resulted in a doubling
of the c vector. Two different polytypes were observed, which feature
geometrically different layer interfaces (non-OD, order–disorder, polytypes),
one with a high stacking fault probability. Oxidation of the methylthio groups of
the benzene-based molecule to methylsulfonyl groups led to three polymorphs
(two temperature-dependent), which were analyzed by Hirshfeld surface de/di
ﬁngerprint plots. The analogously oxidized EDOT-based molecule crystallized
as systematic twins owing to its OD polytypism. Shortening of the backbone by
removal of the aryl core resulted in an enantiomorphic structure and a further
shortening by removal of a methylthio-ene fragment again in a systematically
twinned OD polytype.
1. Introduction
The controlled formation of layers plays an important role in
the design of materials. For example, hybrid organic–inorganic
layered perovskites (Mitzi, 2001) are natural quantum well
structures and can be tuned to speciﬁc electronic, magnetic
and optical properties. The combination of layers with
different properties enables the synthesis of multi-functional
composites (Coronado et al., 2000). In the ﬁeld of organic
electronics the formation of layers has been shown to be a
viable strategy to improve conductivity (Anthony et al., 2001).
Efﬁcient charge transport in organic materials is governed by
nearest-neighbor electronic coupling. The intermolecular
coupling is maximized when a face-to-face orientation of
aromatic molecules is realized, as a consequence of enhanced
interactions of the -electron clouds of adjacent molecules
(Mueller & Bunz, 2007).
Anthony et al. (2001) modiﬁed pentacene by connecting it
at the central C atoms to triisopropylsilyl (TIPS) groups via
rigid ethyne bridges. As opposed to plain pentacene, the
resulting TIPS-pentacene molecules crystallized in layers
(Fig. 1), whereby the pentacene cores are arranged in face-to-
face orientation. As a result, a signiﬁcantly lower resistivity
perpendicular to the pentacene was reported (Anthony et al.,
2001). Hence, TIPS-pentacene yielded promising solution-
processed OFET (organic ﬁeld effect transistor) devices (Park
et al., 2007). In addition to the modiﬁed stacking arrangement
the structures showed improved stability and solubility. On
this basis a general molecular design for improved -stacking
was proposed by Anthony et al. (2002), and intense research in
the ﬁeld of substituted acene derivatives arose from these
ﬁndings and is of ongoing interest (Anthony, 1994, 2008).
Besides technological importance, layered structures are
interesting from a crystallographic point of view. Polymorphs
(different crystal structures of the same composition) that
crystallize in different arrangements of equivalent layers are
called polytypes. Polytypes are ubiquitous in all classes of solid
materials and are often the cause of crystallographically
challenging problems, like twinning (the systematic associa-
tion of equivalent macroscopic domains with different orien-
tations; Hahn, 2006b) and stacking disorder. In order–disorder
(OD) polytyes (Dornberger-Schiff & Grell-Niemann, 1961;
Ferraris et al., 2008) pairs of layers are equivalent and there-
fore all polytypes are locally equivalent. The symmetry of a
polytype is described by groupoids, a generalization of the
group concept (Fichtner, 1986). For OD polytypes these
groupoids are classiﬁed into OD groupoid families (Fichtner,
1977b), in analogy to space group types. These were tabulated
for the special case of OD structures composed of layers of
one kind with identical lattices (Fichtner, 1977a).
Nevertheless, many issues remain unsolved. For example,
OD structures composed of layers with different lattices have
received only a little attention. Yet in some structures, like
K2HAsO42.5H2O (Sto¨ger, Weil & Zobetz, 2012), the different
lattices of the layers are the decisive factor giving rise to OD
polytypism. Moreover, we have discovered structures that
follow the basic principle of OD theory, namely locally
equivalent stacking possibilities, but do not follow the strict
deﬁnition of OD theory (Sto¨ger, Kautny et al., 2012; Sto¨ger &
Weil, 2013). Also, as we will show in this work, polytypes that
are not locally equivalent must not be overlooked. The
symmetry groupoids of these kinds of polytypes are virtually
unexplored. Thus, to shed new light on OD theory and related
kinds of polytypism, we are in search of suitable model
compounds. A fundamental advantage of organic over in-
organic compounds is the ease of introduction of systematic
geometric and electronic modiﬁcations.
An ideal basis for the crystal engineering of layered struc-
tures seemed to be spacer-extended ene–yne molecules
synthesized by tandem thiophene ring-fragmentation (TRF)
reactions (Bobrovsky et al., 2008) owing to the generality and
ﬂexibility of the TRF protocol. The makeup of these mol-
ecules resembles the TIPS-pentacene described above, though
with smaller aromatic rings and a side chain extended by an
ene fragment and a methylthio group (Fig. 2). An interesting
aspect of these ene–yne scaffolds is the possibility to selec-
tively oxidize the methylthio group to modify electronic
properties, but also introduce structure-directing hydrogen-
bond acceptors.
The ﬁrst reports on controlled TRF reactions go back to
Gronowitz & Torbjo¨rn (1970) and Jakobsen (1970). They were
explored in detail by Gronowitz & Frejd (1978), Iddon (1983)
and Gilchrist (1987). This approach enables the selective yield
of Z-isomers of ene–yne compounds as determined by the
cyclic structure of thiophene. The exploration of tandem
fragmentation reactions affording double-sided ring-opened
(ene–yne) products was ﬁrst reported by Fuller et al. (1999) on
substituted thieno[3,2-b]thiophenes.
The ﬁrst synthesized molecule of the class depicted in Fig. 2
was BSEM (1) [benzene spacer-extended with methylthio
group; spacer = benzene, SiR3 = trimethylsilyl (TMS)]. As
expected, in analogy to TIPS-pentacene and related molecules
(Anthony et al., 2001, 2002), BSEM (1) crystallizes in distinct
molecular layers delimited by the bulky and ﬂexible silyl
groups. Therefore, this molecule was chosen as the starting
point of the systematic crystallographic studies presented in
this work.
It has to be noted that, in traditional crystal engineering,
directed intermolecular interactions, notably via hydrogen
bonding or, less commonly, halogen bonds, are used to induce
controlled ‘self-assembly’ of molecules (Aakero¨y et al., 2010).
In the case at hand, no such bonding exists, since the layer-

delimiting moieties are trialkylsilyl groups. Nevertheless, the
special makeup of the molecules clearly induces crystallization
as layered structures, and therefore variations of the spacer-
extended ene–yne compounds can be considered as a form of
crystal engineering.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Molecular modifications
The scope of molecular modiﬁcations and expected impacts
on the layer structures are schematized in Fig. 3. The main
focus is modiﬁcation of the spacer to control the inter-
molecular spacing and width of the layer backbone, with
special attention paid to the effects on the layer interface. The
latter is also determined by the nature of the silyl groups.
Finally, the possibility of introducing potential structure-
directing hydrogen-bond acceptors by oxidation of the
methylthio groups is used to create new kinds of layer struc-
tures.
2.1.1. Spacer modifications. The variations of the spacer
unit are illustrated in Fig. 4. Firstly, the para-substituted
benzene (mmm) spacer was replaced by the electron-rich 2,5-
substituted thiophene (2mm) to TSEM (2). Thiophene is, from
a technological point of view, an interesting core, since poly-
thiophene has been successfully applied in the ﬁeld of organic
semiconductors.
To analyze the effects of a bulkier spacer extending into the
layer plane, we enlarged the spacer to a 3,4-ethylene-
dioxythiophene (EDOT) bicycle, which is, like thiophene,
commonly used in the ﬁeld of organic semiconductors, to give
ESEM (3). Surprisingly, the resulting crystal structure was
incommensurately modulated. Such a structure can be
described by a periodic basic structure and periodic modula-
tion functions, but since the periodicities are incommensurate,
the overall structure is only quasi-periodic (Janssen et al., 2007;
van Smaalen, 2007). A review of incommensurately modu-
lated organic molecular structures was given by Scho¨nleber
(2011).
To better understand the reasons for the modulation, we
synthesized
the
ring-opened
3,4-dimethoxythiophene
compound DSEM (4) featuring even more steric bulk. After
numerous failed crystallization attempts, we were able to
obtain two non-incommensurate polymorphs, which can be
considered as polytypes, from the same crystallization dish and
which will be designated as polytype I and II, respectively.
2.1.2. Oxidation to sulfonyl compounds. The electronic
makeup of the molecules was modiﬁed by oxidation of the
thioether functionality to the corresponding sulfonyl functions
(Lumpi et al., 2014). We obtained crystals of the disulfonyl
analog of BSEM (1): oxBSEM (1b) and the fully oxidized
trisulfonyl analog of ESEM (3): oxESEM (3b).
For oxBSEM (1b) we observed three polymorphs: poly-
morph I reversibly transforms into polymorph II upon cooling
below ca 150 K. Polymorph III is unrelated to the former two
and features no phase transition from 100 K up to the melting
point. So far we were unable to determine the crystallization
conditions needed to selectively obtain either polymorph.
2.1.3. Backbone modifications. An important argument of
OD theory concerns the layer thickness: only for thick layers
can interatomic interactions over a layer width be ignored.
Thus, in a further modiﬁcation we shortened the backbone

(Fig. 5). At ﬁrst the spacer was removed to NSEM (non-
spacer-extended with methylthio group; Bobrovsky et al.,
2008). We were unable to obtain single crystals suitable for
structure determination of the TMS-containing molecule.
Therefore, we synthesized and grew crystals of the corre-
sponding
tert-butyl-dimethylsilyl
(TBDMS)
compound
NSEM-TBDMS (5).
Finally, we shortened the backbone further by removing a
—CH
C(SMe)— fragment to the single-sided ring-opened
product ASYM (6). The name ASYM indicates a lack of
symmetry in the direction of the main axis of the molecule.
Despite the name, the molecule does not possess a stereogenic
center and it can be considered as symmetric by reﬂection.
Besides the short length, the compound seemed especially
interesting in the light of OD theory, since the latter differ-
entiates between polar and nonpolar layers. By growing
crystals of a molecule that is polar with respect to the main
axis, we were hoping to obtain polar layers, yet even ASYM
(6) crystallized in nonpolar layers.
2.2. Molecular structures
The molecules presented in this work are essentially rigid,
but possess three kinds of pivotal points, as depicted in Fig. 6.
The main pivotal point is the connection of the side chains to
the aromatic spacers (or the connection of the side chains in
the case of non-spacer-extended molecules). Moreover, the
methylthio (or methylsulfonyl) groups as well as the silyl
groups can freely rotate. Nevertheless, the overall forms of the
molecules feature little possibility for variation.
In Table 1 the rotation angles about the freely rotatable
bonds of the title compounds are compiled.
In general, the geometries of the molecules are similar. The
most notable trend is that in molecules with a benzene spacer
the C
C(—spacer—)C
C torsion angle is 180 (all mol-
ecules are symmetric by inversion), i.e. the methylthio or
methylsulfonyl groups are located at opposite sides of the
molecules (Fig. 7a). In molecules with a thiophene or a thio-
phene dioxide spacer, on the other hand, the torsion angle is
small, i.e. the methylthio or methylsulfonyl groups face the
same
direction.
Whereas
in
the
methylthio/thiophene
containing molecules [TSEM (2), ESEM (3) and DSEM (4)]
the S atoms of the methylthio groups are in close vicinity to
the S atom of the thiophene ring (Fig. 7b), in the oxidized
trisulfone compound oxESEM (3b) the methylsulfonyl groups
are located at the opposite side of the aromatic ring owing to
steric repulsion (Fig. 7c).
With the exception of the non-spacer-extended molecules
[NSEM-TBDMS
(5),
ASYM
(6)],
the
methylthio
and
methylsulfonyl groups feature a distinct inclination to the
plane of the ene fragment. In contrast, in NSEM-TBDMS (5)
and ASYM (6) one methylthio unit is nearly perfectly aligned
with the ene fragment. Whereas the CH3 unit of the methyl-
thio groups is generally turned towards the spacer (C
C—
S—CH3 torsion angle > 90), the methylsulfonyl groups face
the side chain (C
C—SO2—CH3 torsion angle < 90). An
exception is polymorph II of oxBSEM (1b), whereby the two
unique molecules show the two behaviors, respectively.
The silyl group is in most cases in a gauche conformation to
the side chain with inclination angles of  10–30. Only the
TMS groups in one out of two molecules in polymorph II of
oxBSEM (1b) and one out of two TMS groups in ASYM (6)
are in a nearly perfect anti position (176.7 and 178.4,
respectively).
2.3. Layer stacking
With the exception of polymorph III of oxBSEM (1b), all
structures crystallize in distinct crystallochemical layers,
whereby the silyl groups are located at the layer interfaces. In
Table 2 the symmetry of the layers and the operations relating
adjacent layers are compiled. Here and in the following text,

polytype II of DSEM (4) and in

The molecules in adjacent layers
are inclined in opposite directions
(Fig. 8c). Indeed, these two are the
only structures presented in this
work that lack inversion symmetry
relating adjacent layers (Table 2).

in Fig. 9. The 11 structures can be partitioned into two families
and three unrelated structures.
The ﬁrst family is made up of the structures of BSEM (1)
and of the analogs obtained by substitution of the aromatic
spacer [TSEM (2), ESEM (3) and DSEM (4)]. BSEM (1) and
TSEM (2) are merotypes, i.e. belong to a family of structures
that possess layers common to all members, but also layers
found only in certain members (Makovicky, 1997). Although
the term originates from the crystallography of minerals, an
interpretation of molecular organic structures in terms of
merotypism has for example been given by our group (Sto¨ger,
Kautny et al., 2012).
Increase of the steric bulk of the thiophene spacer in TSEM
(2) to EDOT in ESEM (3) leads to an incommensurately
modulated structure with a basic structure isostructural
(Ka´lma´n et al., 1993) with TSEM (2). The modulation is a
compromise between the need for additional space by the
EDOT spacer and the retention of the structure of the inter-
layer contacts formed by the TMS groups.
On further increase of the steric bulk to dimethox-
ythiophene in DSEM (4), periodicity is restored. Although
structurally related, the symmetries of TSEM (2) and DSEM
(4) are not related by a group/subgroup relationship. Crystals
of two DSEM (4) polytypes were grown in which layers
connect in geometrically different ways (non-OD polytypes).
Owing to these alternative stacking possibilities, the second
polymorph crystallizes as antiphase domains (domains related
by translation symmetry; Wondratschek, 1976), leading to
weak diffraction intensities. Different possible kinds of
connecting layers are also the likely reason for the non-OD
twinning (the interface is geometrically different from the
individuals) of TSEM (2).
Oxidation of the methylthio groups and removal of the
spacer leads to unrelated structures. oxBSEM (1b) exists as
three polymorphs making up the second family. Two poly-
morphs (I and II) are structurally related. Whereas the
arrangement of the molecules is retained, one out of two
molecules inverts orientation. Thus, although the term is
usually reserved for inorganic structures, both polymorphs can
be considered isopointal (same space group and Wyckoff
positions of molecules; de Faria et al., 1990), but not
isostructural. Polymorph III is structurally unrelated and the
only analyzed structure that is not composed of layers.
Of the remaining three structures, oxESEM (3b) and
ASYM (6) crystallize as OD twins, since their layers possess
higher symmetry than adjacent layers. In these twins, the layer
interface can be considered as a fragment of a different
polytype that is locally equivalent to the twin individuals.
Finally, NSEM-TBDMS (5) is the only structure crystal-
lizing in a Sohncke space group (the crystal is enantio-
morphic).

standardized in International Tables for Crystallography (Hahn, 2006a). Boundaries between the A and B layers are indicated by dashed lines.
2.5. Crystal structure details
2.5.1. BSEM (1) and TSEM (2). In the structures of BSEM
(1) and TSEM (2) the molecules are arranged in layers parallel
to (100) with p(1)2/c1 symmetry (Figs. 10a and 10b). Yet,
owing to the intrinsically different symmetries of the para-
substituted benzene (mmm) and 2,5-substituted thiophene
(mm2) rings, the molecules are located on different Wyckoff
positions: Whereas the BSEM (1) molecules are symmetric by
inversion, the TSEM (2) molecules are located on the twofold
rotation axes. Adjacent BSEM (1) and TSEM (2) molecules
are related by the mutual operation: twofold rotations for
BSEM (1) and inversions for TSEM (2).
Despite this difference, the outer parts of the layers are
virtually identical in both structures. Moreover, adjacent
layers connect in equivalent ways via 21 screws, n glides,
inversions and the centering translations (Figs. 10a and 10b).
Thus, to relate their symmetry, the crystal structures of
BSEM (1) and TSEM (2), are ‘sliced’ into two kinds of layers,
which do not correspond to layers in the chemical sense. The
A layers [pð1Þ21=c1], which are composed of the —C
C—
TMS fragments of adjacent molecules, are equivalent in both
structures. The B layers [pð1Þ21=c1] containing the center unit
(aromatic rings, ene fragment and methylthio groups) on the
other hand are fundamentally different (Figs. 10a and 10b).
Since the A and B layers of both structures crystallize in the
same layer group type, BSEM (1) and TSEM (2) possess the
same space-group symmetry. Yet, in a comparable cell setting,
the B layers are translated along c=4 in TSEM (2) compared
with BSEM (1), thus the former is described in the non-
standard I2=c setting of C2=c.
The BSEM (1) molecule is slightly longer than the TSEM
(2) molecule (Si–Si distance of 16.36 versus 16.07 A˚ ).
However, since the inclination of the BSEM (1) molecules
with respect to the layer plane is slightly more pronounced,
the molecular layer width is smaller (asin/2 = 16.89 versus
17.10 A˚ ) and the packing in the [001] direction less dense [c =
10.3442 (18) versus 10.1978(8) A˚ ]. The benzene rings require
more space in the [010] direction compared with the thiophene
rings, as observed by an increased lattice parameter b of
6.8690 (12) versus 6.7415 (4) A˚ . These small structural modi-
ﬁcations have nearly no impact on the layer interface (Figs.
11a and 11b).
The crystal of TSEM (2) was twinned by reﬂection at (001).
Often, OD theory is a convenient tool to understand twinning
in layered structures (Sto¨ger et al., 2013): the twin domain is
interpreted as an alternative but locally equivalent stacking
sequence. Application of OD theory to TSEM (2) did not lead
to such a convincing interpretation, since no local pseudo-
symmetry is present. From a crystallochemical point of view,
the only plausible twin interface is the boundary of the
molecular layers. The molecule contact would then resemble
more closely Fig. 8(c) than Fig. 8(a). Thus, the twin interface is

geometrically different from the twin individuals. The possi-
bility of such a twinning is demonstrated by the DSEM (4)
polytypes (x2.5.3).
2.5.2. ESEM (3). The basic structure of ESEM (3) is
isostructual with TSEM (2) (Fig. 10c). Compared with TSEM
(2), the ESEM (3) molecules are more strongly inclined with
respect to the layer plane, resulting in a larger monoclinic
angle of  = 102.301 (2) versus  = 96.889 (5) and smaller
layer widths (asin = 31.72 versus 34.19 A˚ ). As expected, the
lattice parameter b increases signiﬁcantly from 6.7415 (4) to
8.4003 (5) A˚ owing to the additional space needed by the
ethylenedioxy group.
The actual structure is incommensurately modulated with a
modulation wavevector of q = 2b* with 2 = 0.6223 (1) ’ 5/8.
Although incommensurately modulated structures are non-
periodic, they can be conveniently described by embedding
into 3+n superspace (Janssen et al., 2007; van Smaalen, 2007).
The superspace of ESEM (3) has 3+1-dimensional superspace
group symmetry (van Smaalen et al., 2013; Stokes et al., 2011)
I2=cð020Þs0, a non-standard setting of B2=bð003Þs0, No. 15.3
(Janssen et al., 2006).
Since q is parallel to the layer planes, the layers are
equivalent. Adjacent layers are related by a 21 screw with
intrinsic translation along as2/2 + as4/2, corresponding to an
increase of the internal coordinate t by (2 + 1)/2.
The twofold rotation of the molecules in the basic structure
features an intrinsic translation along as4/2 in internal space.
Thus, half of each molecule is completed by a second half
located at t + 1/2. The individual molecules are therefore
generally not symmetric by twofold rotation and the actual S1
atoms are not located on the twofold rotation axis.
In Figs. 12(b) and 12(c) the progression from the unmo-
dulated chains of molecules along [010] in TSEM (2) to the
modulated chains in ESEM (3) is depicted. On the one hand,
the steric repulsion of the ethylenedioxy groups and the S
atoms requires more space in the [010] direction, on the other
hand the layer contacts via the TMS groups remain similar to
those of TSEM (2) (Figs. 11b and 11c). To accommodate for
both, the structure reacts by different rotations of adjacent
molecules in an incommensurate way.
The distance of the equatorial H112 atoms of the ethyl-
enedioxy group to the S atoms is plotted against the internal
coordinate t in Fig. 13. Roughly two regions can be distin-
guished. For approximately half of the t values, marked by a
gray backdrop in Fig. 13, an H112 atom is close to the thio-
phene S. Adjacent molecules are inclined to each other and
the H112 atom protrudes into the cavity deﬁned by the three S
atoms. For the remaining t values, the molecules feature little
inclination and the two H112 atoms connect only to the S
atoms of the methylthio atom. In Fig. 12(b) H—S distances up

to an arbitrary value of 2.91 A˚ are indicated to highlight the
two kinds of contacts.
Owing to the rigidity of the ESEM (3) molecules small
rotations of the EDOT core translate into larger displace-
ments of the TMS groups (Figs. 14a and 14b). Therefore, the
connection of adjacent layers via the TMS groups features a
wide variation of interatomic distances (Fig. 11). This
surprising
ﬂexibility
of
the
interlayer
contacts
enables
incommensurate modulation.
The variation of the geometry of the ESEM (3) molecules is
pictured in Figs. 14(c) and 14(d). The interatomic distances are
close to constant (Fig. 15) and in good agreement with the
expected values (Allen et al., 2006). Whereas the core of the
molecule is virtually identical in all molecules, the side arms
(yne fragment, TMS group) feature signiﬁcant bending (Fig.
14c), needed to contact adjacent layers.
2.5.3. DSEM (4). Like in TSEM (2) and ESEM (3), the
DSEM (4) molecules in both polytypes are arranged in rods
running along the [010] direction (Fig. 12c). In contrast to
ESEM (3), periodicity in the [010] direction is restored by
rotating all molecules in a rod in the same direction (Fig. 12c).
The symmetry of the rods is thus reduced from pb121 to p1. The
rods form pairs which are related by inversion and adjacent
pairs are related by 21 screws. As a consequence the c lattice
vector is doubled compared with TSEM (2). Owing to the
different arrangements of the rods the DSEM (4) layers
cannot be considered as superstructures of the TSEM (2)
layers and indeed, their symmetry groups (pð1Þ21=c1 with
doubled c and pð1Þ2=c1) are not related by a group/subgroup
relationship.
Although the DSEM (4) polytypes are non-OD polytypes,
in the following discussion the naming conventions of OD
theory will be used (Ferraris et al., 2008): the layers are
designated as An, whereby the n is a serial index. a0 is the
vector normal to the layer planes with the length of one layer
thickness.
Given an An layer, the adjacent An+1 layer can appear in two
different orientations. An and An+1 are either related by the
operations listed in Table 2, line 4, or those in line 5. The
symmetry elements are indicated in Fig. 16.

Thus, the layers can be connected to an inﬁnity of polytypes,
which are not OD polytypes because (An, An+1) layer pairs are
not necessarily equivalent [pð1Þ2=c1 and pðcÞc2 symmetry,
respectively]. The polytypes differ from other non-OD poly-
types we discussed before (Sto¨ger et al., 2012a; Sto¨ger & Weil,
2013). In the latter, which we designated as ‘non-classic OD’
polytypes, every polytype is at every point locally equivalent
to all other polytypes, i.e. every point belongs to at least two
equivalence regions (Grell, 1984). In DSEM (4), on the other
hand, the contact plane of the layers differs geometrically
among polytypes as depicted in Fig. 17. As in the case of
ESEM (3) this demonstrates a remarkable ﬂexibility of the
layer contacts and conﬁrms the assumption that the twinning
of TSEM (2) is likewise caused by non-equivalent layer
contacts.
Although the symmetry groupoids of these kind of non-OD
polytypes were not elaborated up to now, the OD concept of
polytypes with a maximum degree of order (MDO) (Dorn-
berger-Schiff, 1982) can nevertheless be applied. There are
two polytypes that cannot be decomposed into simpler poly-
types. They are generated by continuous application of either
set of operations relating the adjacent layers. The MDO1
polytype has C2/c symmetry and lattice vector 2a0 þ ðr  1Þc;
MDO2 Pccn symmetry and lattice vector 2a0.
The observed polytypes I and II are MDO1 and MDO2,
respectively. Indeed, it is well documented for OD structures
that ordered polytypes are in the vast majority of cases MDO.
Fragments of the MDO2 polytype in MDO1 result in twinning
by reﬂection at a plane normal to [001]. No such twinning was
observed in the investigated crystal. Stacking faults in MDO2,
on the other hand, results in antiphase domains (Wondrat-
schek, 1976), since the MDO2 domains are related by trans-
lation. Although in principle not directly observable in
diffraction patterns, we suspect that such stacking faults exist
and cause the systematic low scattering power of the polytype
II crystals.
As opposed to OD structures, where ordered polytypes
usually feature desymmetrization of the layers compared to
the idealized description (Dˇ urovicˇ, 1979), the A layers in both
MDO polytypes of DSEM (4) possess the pð1Þ21=c symmetry
of the idealized description. A deviation from the idealized
model is nevertheless observed by a slight variation of the
lattice parameters and layer widths across structures [asin =
33.765 versus 33.630 (10) A˚ , b = 8.1665 (5) versus 8.271 (2) A˚
and c = 20.0791 (12) versus 19.717 (6) A˚ ] and a small deviation
of the molecular conformations (Fig. 18). As expected, the
largest deviation is observed for the TMS groups, which are
located in geometrically different environments in both
polytypes.

2.5.4. oxBSEM (1b), polymorphs I and II. Both polymorphs
consist of two crystallographically different oxBSEM (1b)
molecules (Fig. 19), called A and B, both located on centers of
inversion (Z0 = 2/2). In both polymorphs, the crystal-
lographically
independent
molecules
feature
different
conformations: The molecules in polymorph I differ by the
conformation of the TMS groups with respect to the remaining
molecule, whereas in polymorph II the major difference
pertains to the orientation of the methylsulfonyl groups (Fig.
19). Nevertheless, the torsion angle differences between all
four conformations (Table 1) are too small for the molecules
to be considered as conformers according to the criteria of
Cruz-Cabeza & Bernstein (2014). Thus, the changes in these
polymorphs are only conformational adjustments, though to a
rather large degree in the molecule of polymorph II that has a
different orientation of the methylsulfonyl groups.
The molecules are arranged in layers parallel to (001) with
pð1Þ11 symmetry, whereby the B molecules form rods along
[100], connected by the A molecules (Fig. 20).
The most striking difference between the two polymorphs is
the orientation of the A molecules, which are rotated by nearly
180. In projection along [100], the S atoms of the methyl-
sulfonyl groups are nearly superimposed in polymorph II,
while in polymorph I the methylsulfonyl groups of subsequent
molecules point in opposite directions (Fig. 21).
Thus, the I $ II phase transition has to be considered
reconstructive, which is consistent with the destruction of
large single crystals on cooling. The transformation is
accompanied by an inclination of the molecules with respect to
the stacking direction (Figs. 21b and 21d). In consequence, the
layer interfaces are fundamentally different in the two poly-
types (Fig. 22), demonstrating again the ﬂexibility in layer
arrangements allowed by the TMS groups.
Although methylsulfonyl groups are potential hydrogen
bond acceptors, the oxBSEM (1b) molecules do not possess
classical hydrogen-bond donors. Indeed, attempts to analyze
the phase transition by listing the weak hydrogen bonds of the
two polymorphs were inconclusive, since these lists depend on
rather arbitrary distance and angle limits. A more holistic and
unbiased approach for the description of molecular inter-
actions in polymorphs, which was established in the last
decade, is the analysis of molecular Hirshfeld surfaces

(Spackman & Jayatilaka, 2009). The de/di ﬁngerprint plots
(Spackman & McKinnon, 2002) of the two molecules in both
polymorphs are depicted in Fig. 23. As expected, contacts not
involving H atoms, as well as those involving S and Si atoms,
are negligible. First conclusions can be drawn from the shape
of the plots: In both polymorphs, the individual plots are not
symmetric by reﬂection at the de = di line, but the plots of the
crystallographically independent molecules are approximately
related by such an operation. Thus, the closest contacts are
mostly between non-equivalent molecules along the [010]
direction. An exception are the regions 1 and 2 in Fig. 23,
which correspond to C
C—H  O and SC—H  C
C
contacts of equivalent molecules along [100] (Fig. 20).
Surprisingly, the ﬁngerprint plot of the A molecule of
polymorph I resembles the plot of the B molecule of poly-
morph II and vice versa. Thus, one could say that the roles of
the donor and acceptor are reversed on phase transition,
although overall the type of interatomic interaction remains
similar. The most prominent interactions are indicated in Fig.
23 and correlated to the actual atoms in Fig. 20 and Table 3. A
striking feature that is only observed in polymorph I is region
6, a very short C—H  H—C contact (2.30 A˚ ) between two
aromatic protons. Thus, although there is no deﬁnite proof,
one might speculate that, on cooling, the structure contracts
until these H atoms are too close and the structure becomes
unstable. This conjecture would not have been insinuated
without the analysis of ﬁngerprint plots.

The molecules in polymorph III of
oxBSEM (1b) are not arranged in

(Fig.

One
crystallographically
unique
oxBSEM
(1b)
molecule
is
located on a center of inversion. It can
again not be considered a different
conformer. As expected, the Hirshfeld
ﬁngerprint plot (Fig. 21e) is nearly
symmetric by reﬂection at de = di. It
most closely resembles the plot of the A
molecule in polymorph II, but the H  C contacts are
distinctly less prominent, indicating an energetically more
favorable
packing.
Indeed,
polymorph
III
has
higher
symmetry (same space group type, but Z0 = 1/2 versus 2/2) and
distinctly higher density (1.267 versus 1.229 g cm3 at 100 K).
Thus, the I $ II transition is an example of Ostwald’s rule
stating that a system does not change into the thermo-
dynamically stable, but the nearest metastable state.
2.5.6. oxESEM (3b). The oxESEM (3b) molecules are
arranged in layers parallel to (001) with (idealized) p21=b1ð1Þ
symmetry (Fig. 25), which are, despite possessing the
same layer group type, structurally unrelated to the layers in
BSEM (1), TSEM (2), the basic structure of ESEM (3) and
DSEM (4).
One crystallographically unique molecule is located on a
general position. The layers are stacked in such a way that the
b-glide planes do not overlap. In consequence oxESEM (3b)
belongs to a category I OD family composed of layers of one
kind. The OD groupoid family symbol reads according to the
notation introduced by Dornberger-Schiff & Grell-Niemann
(1961) as

It has to be noted that in this case c0 is conveniently chosen not

tation of the layers with respect to the stacking direction
[called - partial operations (POs) in the OD literature].
These stacking possibilities give rise to two MDO polytypes:
MDO1 {P1, c = c0 + [(r  1)/2]a} and MDO2 (P21=n11, c = 2c0),
obtained by continuous application of the 2r screws and n1,2
glides, respectively. The symmetry of the two polytypes is
schematized in Fig. 26.
The major polytype of the crystals under investigation is the
MDO1 polytype. Fragments of the MDO2 polytype were
observed indirectly by systematic twinning. The twin element
corresponds to the plane of the b glides of the A layers. This
kind of twinning is fundamentally different from that in TSEM
(2) or the polytypism of DSEM (4). The latter is only possible
owing to the ﬂexibility of the layer contacts, whereas in
oxESEM (3b) the layer contacts are
equivalent in all polytypes.
In the major MDO1 polytype, the
symmetry of the A layers is reduced by
an index of 2 from p21=b1ð1Þ to p11ð1Þ.
This translates to a small deviation of
 = 89.771 (2) from the ideal value of
90 imposed by the rectangular layer
lattice and a small deviation of the
atoms from the positions compared
with the idealized p21=b1ð1Þ layers.
Signiﬁcant
deviations
from
ideal
symmetry are limited to the TMS
groups, which are located at the layer
interfaces [deviations of 0.272 A˚ (Si2)
up to 0.508 A˚ (C10)]. This is expected,
since the layer interfaces are located in
an environment which deviates from
the ideal layer symmetry. The closer
the atoms are located to the center of
the layers, the smaller the deviation.
The C atoms of the yne fragment
connecting to the TMS group deviate
by 0.130 A˚ (C8) and 0.138 A˚ (C16), all
other atoms by less than 0.100 A˚ .

the number of achiral molecules crys-

Whereas the central part of the

arranged in nonpolar layers parallel to (010) with p1ð1Þ1
symmetry (Fig. 28).
In contrast to the other layered structures, the TMS groups
are not as clearly located at the layer interface: every second
group is moved away from the surface into the layers. This can
be attributed to ASYM (6) being the shortest of the molecules
under investigation.
The systematic twinning of ASYM (6) can be explained by
local pseudosymmetry: With the exception of one TMS group,
the molecules are practically symmetric by reﬂection at (100)
(Fig. 28b). Thus the structure can be ‘sliced’ into OD layers
(Grell, 1984) of two kinds, which do not correspond to layers
in the crystallochemical sense (Fig. 28). The A1 layers contain
the parts of the molecule that possess mirror symmetry,
whereas the A2 layers are made up of the remaining TMS
groups.
As a consequence, the structure belongs to a category IV
OD family composed of nonpolar layers of two kinds. The
corresponding OD groupoid family symbol reads according to
the notation introduced by Grell & Dornberger-Schiff (1982)
as
A1
A2
p21=mð1Þ1
p1ð1Þ1
½0; s
:
Accordingly, the structure is made up of an alternating
stacking of A1 and A2 layers, with p21=mð1Þ1 and p1ð1Þ1
symmetry, respectively. b0 is chosen not normal to the layer
planes so that one metric parameter vanishes. In one possible
arrangement of the ðA1
n; A2
nþ1Þ layer pair, the origin of A2 is
reached from the origin of A1 by translation along (b0/2) + sa.
According to the NFZ relationship, given an A1
n layer, the
adjacent A2
n1 layers can appear in Z = N/F = [pm(1)1:p1(1)1]
= 2 orientations, related by the m operation of the A1
n layer.
For the A2 layers on the other hand, there is only one way
to connect to the A1 layers, since all
- POs of A2 (p1ð1Þ1) apply likewise
to A1.
These stacking possibilities give
rise to two MDO polytypes: MDO1
(P1, b = b0 + 2sa) is obtained by
continuous application of the inver-
sion operations of the A1 layers;
MDO2 (P21=b11, b = 2b0) by appli-
cation of the 21 screws. The symmetry
of the two polytypes is schematized
in Fig. 29.
The bulk of the ASYM (6) crystals
under investigation are made up of
the MDO1 polytype, whereas frag-
ments of the MDO2 polytype are
located at the twin interface. A twin
element corresponds to the mirror
plane of the A1 layers. Again, all
polytypes are locally equivalent and
no ﬂexibility of the layer contact is
needed for twinning.
In MDO1, the symmetry of the A1
layers is reduced by an index of 2
from p21=mð1Þ1 to p1ð1Þ1. This is
reﬂected by a deviation of  =
92.510 (2) from the ideal value of
90 according to the rectangular layer
lattice, and by a slight deviation of

the molecules from their idealized positions. Under the
assumption of  = 90, the only non-negligible deviations
(> 0.1 A˚ ) of non-H atoms from the idealized positions of the
A1 layers are observed for the atoms of the TMS group that
are not located on the mirror plane (C10, C11, deviation of
0.11 A˚ ) and for the C3 atom, which connects to the TMS
group in the A2 layer (deviation of 0.12 A˚ ).
The deviation of  from the ideal value of 90 by 2.51 is
remarkably large and distinctly larger than in the case of
oxESEM (3b). As a consequence, the lattices of the twin
domains do not match (deviation of 5) and the crystals are
distinctly distorted at the twin interface. The orthorhombic
MDO2 fragment at the twin interface possesses an ideal angle
of 90 and it therefore enables the passage of the two extremes
of the MDO1 domains.
In contrast to oxESEM (3b), the desymmetrization does not
result in two crystallographically unique molecules, but rather
in a desymmetrization of the A1 parts of the molecule from m
to 1 symmetry.
3. Experimental
Detailed syntheses and spectroscopic characterizations of all
compounds are given by Lumpi (2013). Single crystals of
BSEM (1) (i-PrOH, EtOH), oxBSEM (1b) (EtOH), ESEM (3)
(EtOH, in a glove-box with N2 atmosphere), oxESEM (3b)
(MeOH) and DSEM (4) (EtOH) were obtained by slow
evaporation at room temperature. Crystallization of TSEM (2)
from solvents failed to give single crystals suitable for single-
crystal diffraction. Tiny single crystals were instead afforded
by crystallization of the oily sample at 293 K over a time
period of several months.
Single-crystal data were collected and processed on a
Bruker Kappa APEXII diffractometer system (Bruker, 2008).
Data were reduced using the SAINT-Plus (Bruker, 2008) and
EVAL (Duisenberg et al., 2003) suites and corrected for
absorption effects with SADABS or TWINABS (Bruker,
2008). Structures were solved with SUPERFLIP (Palatinus &
Chapuis, 2007) and reﬁned with JANA2006 (Petrˇı´cˇek et al.,
2014). More details on single-crystal diffraction and structure
reﬁnement are available as supplementary materials.
4. Conclusion and outlook
We set out to create layered structures, expecting to obtain
OD polytypes due to different local layer symmetry. We were
indeed successful with the systematic twins oxESEM (3a) and
ASYM (6). Surprisingly though, we observed numerous other

crystallographic phenomena, which are not caused by local
layer symmetry but by the remarkable ﬂexibility of the layer
contacts. On the one hand, a given layer contact can accom-
modate signiﬁcant distortion leading to the incommensurate
modulation of ESEM (3). On the other hand, identical layers
can connect in fundamentally different ways as observed in
the non-OD polytypism of TSEM (2) and DSEM (4) and the
layer contacts can accomodate the different molecular
arrangements observed in the temperature-dependent poly-
morphism of oxBSEM (1b).
These phenomena demonstrate the necessity of a general-
ization of space-group symmetry to local symmetry. These so-
far unexplored groupoids are necessary not only for the
description of polytypism, but also of structural relationships
like the merotypism of BSEM (1) and TSEM (2).
Future synthetic work will focus on the core of the layers
(alterations of the aromatic spacer and an elongation of the
methylthio groups), as well as the application of other silyl
groups like TBDMS or TIPS to induce different layer contacts
as in NSEM-TBDMS (5). Besides studying crystallographic
phenomena, the application of acene or polythiophene deri-
vatives may also enable the application of the layer motifs in
the ﬁeld of functional organic materials. To achieve this goal
an adjustment of the steric bulk of the cores and the size of the
silyl groups will be needed to obtain an optimum face-to-face
stacking of the extended aromatic cores. Moreover, the
merotypism of BSEM (1) and TSEM (2) presents an oppor-
tunity for the controlled epitaxial growth of different kinds of
molecules, a crucial point in the design of devices.
