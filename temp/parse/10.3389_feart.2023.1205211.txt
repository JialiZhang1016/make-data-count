Previous margin-wide studies of methane seep distribution along the Cascadia
Subduction Zone indicate peaks in seep density within the landward limit of the of
gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ; ≤500 m depth), suggesting a link between
current ocean warming, acceleration of hydrate dissociated, and methane
emissions. This inferred connection, however, may not account for regional
geologic and/or structural complexities driving methane seepage. Expanding
upon an existing seep database by adding new seep data, we conducted
statistical and spatial analyses to determine margin-wide distribution trends
and offer a tectonic framework for understanding the tendency toward non-
normality and spatial clustering. We then highlight the role of local-scale drivers of
seep formation in addition to the ﬁrst-order tectonic framework, using systematic
geologic/geomorphic characterization of seep emission sites in southern
Cascadia and case studies using meta-attribute analysis of seismic reﬂection
data. Seep distribution along the margin is non-random, but instead of
clustering along the 500-m isobath, regions of high seep density occur in
canyons and topographic highs. New ﬁndings from this study conclude that
co-location of the outer arc high (OAH) and the landward limit of the GHSZ
may explain high concentrations of seeps where deformation is the greatest and
hydrates are unstable. Detailed analysis of the spatial relationships between seep
sites and geologic-geomorphic features in southern Cascadia reveal a link
between seeps and anticlines, with 52% of the seeps found in association with
anticlines, 36% found at faults, 16% associated with canyons, and 11% at seaﬂoor
failure scarps. Given that a majority of anticlines are located along or seaward of
the OAH in the actively deforming outer wedge, we suggest that the location of
the OAH is a primary structural control on seep distribution. This scenario is
supported by neural network analysis of multichannel seismic data revealing
zones of probable ﬂuid migration along vertical pipes, faults, and chimneys in
the vicinity of active seep sites on anticlines. Determining linkages between seeps
and submarine tectonic geomorphology is a crucial ﬁrst step for understanding
and forecasting the distribution of methane seepage, but also a necessity for
evaluating causal relationships between ocean warming and gas hydrate stability.

1 Introduction
Warming of ocean-bottom waters has been linked to hydrate
dissociation at the landward limit of the gas hydrate stability zone
(GHSZ) in the Southern Ocean (Ketzer et al., 2020) and Arctic
Ocean (Westbrook et al., 2009; Berndt et al., 2014), and has been
suggested as a mechanism to explain the high frequency of seep
emissions along the 500-m isobath off the Oregon and Washington
coasts (Hautala et al., 2014; Johnson et al., 2015). For example, Merle
et al. (2021) reported a nearly bell-shaped normal distribution curve
in the depth-frequency of over 1,300 emission sites along the
Washington and northern/central Oregon margin that correlates
with the landward limit of the GHSZ, suggesting a link between
methane release and ocean warming. Emissions of hydrogen sulﬁde,
methane, and other hydrocarbon-rich ﬂuids into the sediment and
water column are well documented and widespread along the
Cascadia margin (e.g., Johnson et al., 2015; Riedel et al., 2018;
Merle et al., 2021), with precipitates of slow growing methane-
derived authigenic carbonates suggesting ﬂuid seepage over
thousands of years (Bohrmann et al., 1998; Suess et al., 1999;
Teichert et al., 2003; Torres et al., 2009; Johnson et al., 2015;
Paull et al., 2015). In addition, the occurrence of bottom
simulating reﬂectors (BSRs), the boundary between hydrate-
containing sediment overlying sediment that contains free gas
(Trehu et al., 1995), over large areas suggests a high abundance
of hydrates and trapped free gas below along the Cascadia margin
accretionary complex (Tréhu et al., 2004; Torres et al., 2009). Gas
hydrates are stable over moderate-pressure (P) conditions and a
range of low temperatures (T) found close to the seaﬂoor at
deepwater
continental
slopes
sites
with
sufﬁcient
methane
saturation (Canﬁeld et al., 2005; Collett, 2009). Changes to the
P-T stability conditions, such as ocean warming, can drive the
breakdown (e.g., dissociation) of hydrates (see review by Ruppel
and
Waite,
2020).
However,
these
temporal
processes
are
superimposed on long-lived geologic controls of ﬂuid migration
that deﬁne seep characteristics and help explain the driving
mechanisms of ﬂuid expulsion (Judd and Hovland, 2007; Suess,
2014). Therefore, a detailed geospatial analysis of seep distribution,
including newly acquired data from southern Cascadia, is needed in
order to determine if there is a link between current ocean warming
and seep distribution along the Cascadia margin.
To address this knowledge gap and further explore geologic
controls on focused seep distribution along the Cascadia margin, we
examine new water-column data from U.S. Geological Survey
(USGS) seaﬂoor mapping activities on the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric
Administration
(NOAA)
Hydrographic
Survey
Vessels Rainier and Fairweather from 2018 to 2021, as well as
from both active and relict (or dormant) seep indicators such as
authigenic carbonates and microbial mats to supplement the
existing seep composite database (Merle et al., 2021). To develop
a tectonic framework of seep emissions based on geologic controls,
along-margin variation in seep distribution is investigated in the
context of morphotectonic regions and seismogenic behavior. In
particular, we integrate new multibeam bathymetry, backscatter
data, and seismic reﬂection proﬁles in southern Cascadia to

determine potential controls on focused ﬂuid ﬂow in an area with
previously sparse coverage. With this updated composite dataset, we
examine regional variation in the depth distribution of methane
seeps along the Cascadia margin and test our hypothesis that seep
distribution is fundamentally tied to ﬁrst- and second-order
geological phenomena that operate independently of gas hydrate
dissociation in response to contemporary ocean warming.
1.1 Geologic setting
The Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) is an active plate
boundary where the Juan de Fuca, Gorda, and Explorer plates
subduct beneath the North American plate. This convergent
boundary extends over 1,300 km from the Nootka fracture zone
offshore British Columbia (Canada) in the north (Audet et al., 2008)
to the Mendocino triple junction offshore northern California
(United States) in the south (Figure 1). A large accretionary
wedge composed of both terrigenous and marine sediments has
been accreted to the North America plate along the CSZ. This wedge
contains a series of folded and thrusted ridges striking subparallel to
the continental slope that form large anticlines (Cochrane and
Lewis, 1984; Goldﬁnger et al., 1991). There is also signiﬁcant
along-strike geophysical and geologic heterogeneity that has been
linked to different modes and rates of stress accumulation and
release along the margin (see summary in Walton et al., 2021). Such
variability could reﬂect differences in sediment and pore-ﬂuid
properties that ultimately inﬂuence ﬂuid migration due to rapid
compaction and dewatering rates (Tréhu et al., 2004; Han et al.,
2017). For example, high glacial sediment ﬂux during the Pleistocene
signiﬁcantly expanded the size of the outer wedge in northern
Cascadia, between Juan de Fuca and Astoria Canyons (Silver,
1972; Barnard, 1973).
Broadly, the offshore accretionary wedge can be divided into two
margin-parallel zones separated by the outer arc high (OAH), which
is deﬁned as a broad structural high that bounds the seaward edge of
the shelf forearc basins (e.g., von Huene and Scholl, 1991; Clift and
Vannucchi, 2004; McNeill and Henstock, 2014). While the OAH
typically follows the shelf break along the 200-m isobath in Cascadia,
deviations from the shelf break, both landward and seaward are
observed, and may be linked to regional variations in the width of
the outer wedge. Watt and Brothers (2020) identiﬁed four distinct
morphotectonic
regions
based
on
careful
examination
of
geophysical examination of seismic proﬁles to describe variable
accretionary wedge width, shape, and structural vergence. These
four regions include: (1) Vancouver Island, British Columbia,
Canada
(average
width,
linear
wedge,
seaward
and
mixed
vergence); (2) Washington, United States (higher width, concave
wedge, landward and mixed vergence); (3) northern and central
Oregon, United States (average width, linear and convex wedge,
mixed and seaward vergence); and (4) southern Oregon and
northern California, United States (lower width, convex wedge,
seaward and mixed vergence). Regional patterns and differences
in the tectonic evolution of the outer accretionary wedge are also
linked to Cascadia margin-wide heterogeneity in the distribution
and character of the BSR (Tréhu and Phrampus, 2022). For example,
BSRs were observed beneath anticlines where internal deformation
of the wedge replenishes the supply of methane to the GHSZ at the
crest of the anticlines by compacting sediments and providing
pathways to the shallow subsurface (Tréhu and Phrampus, 2022).
Therefore,
tectonic
factors
inﬂuencing
the
occurrence
and
disruption of the BSR and associated ﬂuid expulsion are also
important in constraining the spatial distribution of cold seeps
along the Cascadia margin.
2 Data and methods
2.1 Seaﬂoor mapping and seep database
The
seep
database
includes
previously
published
data
documenting over 2,850 active seep ﬂares on the seaﬂoor using
ship-based multibeam echo-sounding (MBES) sonar (Johnson et al.,
2015; Riedel et al., 2018; Merle et al., 2021), and 902 new seep ﬂares
identiﬁed during surveys by the NOAA Ships Rainier in 2018
(surveys H13117, H13118, H13119, H13137, and H13206) and
Fairweather in 2019 and 2021 (surveys W00474, W00475, and
H13549) (Conrad and Rudebusch, 2023; Supplementary Table
S1). Bubble plumes associated with seeps were mapped in the
MBES water column backscatter data using QPS FMMidwater
software, using techniques and identiﬁcation criteria similar to
those described by Merle et al. (2021). The geologic setting of the
bubble plume locations was determined from interpretation of the
morphologic and bottom characteristics of the seaﬂoor from
multibeam bathymetry and backscatter data (https://www.ncei.
noaa.gov/maps/bathymetry/) and from subbottom data derived
from seismic reﬂection proﬁles (Balster-Gee et al., 2023a). In
addition, evidence for both active and relict (or dormant) seep
indicators including authigenic carbonates, vesicomyid clams,
tubeworms, and microbial mats, were included from seaﬂoor
observations
and
collections
made
using
remotely
operated
vehicles (ROVs) (Supplementary Table S1). The inclusion of seep
evidence from ROVs proved useful for revealing additional seep
locations that were not detected by traditional ship hull-mounted
multibeam echosounders. Therefore, seep-distribution reported
here is a presence-pseudoabsence dataset, not presence-absence.
Diffuse seepage, where gas concentrations are not sufﬁcient for gas
phase emissions, was not included given the difﬁculty in identifying
diffuse
seepage
acoustically.
Following
previously
published
methods of Johnson et al. (2015) for removing possible double-
counted seeps due to overlapping surveys, we aggregated seeps
found within 300 m of each other into single seep “emission
site,” yielding a dataset of 880 seep emission sites for a new
composite database (Supplementary Table S1). To account for
variance in surface area of the depth contour polygons and the
effect of unequal survey effort across depth bins, we included only
seeps detected via MBES so that we could normalize the number of
seeps with the corresponding area mapped and determine seep
density.

depth surface from a global multiresolution bathymetric elevation
model
(Ryan
et
al.,
2009),

the
area

corresponding
with the seep
location data.
Depth contour
polygons were created from this layer at 100-m intervals and
seep emission sites were spatially joined to their respective depth
contour polygon. Seep density (per sq. kilometer) was calculated for
each 100-m depth contour. A smoothed kernel density estimation
curve was ﬁtted to the data for the margin-wide (Figure 2), as well as
at the regional scale (Figure 3), in order to investigate seep
distribution per morphotectonic region. To test for normality in
the seep depth distribution we used normal Q-Q plots and a
Shapiro-Wilk
test
(Shapiro
and
Wilk,
1965;
Wilk
and
Gnanadesikan, 1968). Patterns in seep distribution were further
explored in order to identify signiﬁcant seep clusters along the
margin (Optimized Hot Spot Analysis tool in ArcGIS Pro 3.0, Esri).
Optimized Hot Spot Analysis was used to spatially interrogate the
dataset to optimally aggregate coincident features into hexbins based
on the Global Moran’s I statistic of spatial autocorrelation, and then
calculate a Getis-Ord Gi* statistic for each hexbin to compare the
aggregated counts of seeps within each hexbin against those of its
nearest neighbors. Cluster predictions are determined by the
aggregation of seeps within neighboring hexbins as compared to
the null hypothesis of a random distribution. We used an analysis
cell size of 10 km and a ﬁxed distance band of 20 km, as determined
by the initial steps run by the Optimized Hot Spot Analysis tool to
identify the optimal scale of analysis. All aggregation hexbins had a
minimum of 8 neighbors, and on average 16 nearest neighbors were
used with a moving window analysis to determine statistical clusters.
The resultant z-scores for each aggregation hexbin identiﬁed the
intensity
of
the
clustering,
with
larger
positive
z-scores
(p-value<0.05) indicating more signiﬁcant seep clusters. We
included only the clustering for features signiﬁcant at the 95%–
99% conﬁdence levels.
2.3 Geologic-geomorphic attribute
In order to determine potential controls on focused ﬂuid ﬂow in
southern Cascadia, an area with previously sparse coverage, we
systematically assigned a primary (and in some cases, secondary)
geologic/geomorphic attribute to each seep emission site in region 4 of
Watt and Brothers (2020) Seaﬂoor expressions of ﬂuid expulsion or
other indicators of ﬂuid ﬂow, such as pockmarks or authigenic
carbonates but otherwise lacking evidence of active seepage, were
not included. Instead, we integrated new multibeam bathymetry,
backscatter
data,
and
seismic
reﬂection
proﬁles
to
identify
attributes previously inferred to be associated with substrate ﬂuid
ﬂow: anticline, fault, failure scarp, shelfbreak, channel, bedding
outcrop, and canyon (e.g., Skarke et al., 2014; Crutchley et al.,
2018; Riedel et al., 2018; Prouty et al., 2020). Locations of these
attributes were determined from their geomorphic expression on the
seaﬂoor (Supplementary Figure S1) and supplemented with seismic
reﬂection proﬁles where available. For example, bubble plume
locations were combined with the multibeam bathymetry and
backscatter
data
(https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/maps/bathymetry/)
and seismic reﬂection proﬁles (Triezenberg et al., 2016) for
visualization and interpretation of the local geologic/geomorphic
setting within a 50-m buffer of the seep occurrences and logged
using a geographic information system (GIS) (ArcMap 10, Esri).
Information on anticline locations was derived from previously
published neotectonic maps in southern Cascadia (Clarke and
Carver, 1992; Goldﬁnger et al., 1992; Goldﬁnger et al., 1997) but is
currently unavailable for northern Cascadia.

interval depth bins overlaid on the percentage of the seaﬂoor mapped (gray bars) with MBES and co-located water-column data for each depth bin, as
compared with the total area of the depth contour (area mapped/total area). Depths with values close to 100 signify near-complete survey coverage,
whereas values close to 0 represent data deﬁciencies with regards to sparse MBES and water-column survey coverage.

In addition to examining seep distribution in the context of
regional
controls
in
southern
Cascadia,
margin-wide
seep
distribution was evaluated with respect to the landward limit of
the GHSZ and the OAH. The OAH was designated as the location of
broad structural high with a ±10-km buffer that runs along the
seaward edge of the shelf forearc basins (Watt and Brothers, 2020).
Joung et al. (2022) showed the landward limit of gas hydrate
determined for the northern Cascadia margin based on bottom
water temperatures recorded by CTD data. This type of analysis is
hard to adapt for the whole margin due to lack of complete data
coverage (C.D. Ruppel, USGS, written commun., 07/04/23) and we
instead adopted the 500-m isobath as the nominal the landward
limit of the GHSZ (Tréhu and Phrampus, 2022).
2.4 Seismic reﬂection data
Multichannel seismic reﬂection datasets were utilized to reveal
subsurface structure and stratigraphy under mapped seeps where
available (e.g., Triezenberg et al., 2016). Additional seismic surveys
were collected in 2018 aboard the R/V Coral Sea using an 88-channel
Geometrics GeoEel digital hydrophone streamer and Applied
Acoustic Delta Sparker sound source (Balster-Gee et al., 2023a)
and in 2019 onboard the R/V Rachel Carson and utilized a 72-
channel Geometrics GeoEel streamer and the Delta Sparker sound
source (Balster-Gee et al., 2023b). Both sparker datasets were
processed following processing procedures laid out in Kluesner
et al. (2019) and included SEGD to SEGY conversion, geometry

(vertical line) and mean (diamond) depth values displayed inside the boxes. The landward limit of the gas hydrate stability zone for the Cascadia margin is
indicated with the red dashed lines (500-m isobath).

FK ﬁlter, spike removal, bandpass ﬁltering, velocity analysis, normal
move-out correction, trim static corrections, cmp stacking, post-
stack migration, gap deconvolution, water column mute, and
automatic gain control. In addition to the workﬂow above, the
2019 sparker dataset included prestack deterministic deconvolution
using shot-to-shot source signature information recorded during
acquisition.
2.5 Chimney analysis
To optimize the detection of gas and ﬂuid migration pathways in
the vicinity of active seep sites with focused ﬂuid ﬂow (Heggland,
2005; Ligtenberg, 2005; Kluesner et al., 2013; Brothers et al., 2014;
Connolly, 2015), a fully connected multi-layer perceptron neural-
network approach was applied to 2-D high-resolution multichannel
seismic (MCS) proﬁles at seep sites in region 4. Within the
OpendTect software package, twenty-one attributes were used as
input
nodes
into
the
supervised
neural-network
chimney
calculation, and each node was weighted during the neural-
network training (for details see Kluesner and Brothers (2016).
The chimney meta-attribute results were projected onto seismic
cross-sections using a gradational color scale with transparency that
reveals only the highest (~80% and above) chimney probabilities,
yielding a measurement of the probability between 0 (lowest) to 1
(highest) for presence of a chimney structure. Two types of features
were identiﬁed, zones of probable ﬂuid migration (e.g., vertical
pipes, faults, and chimneys) and gassy sediments. The frequency-
dependent reﬂectivity of gassy sediments due to scattering and
absorption has been previously documented (e.g., Wood et al.,
2008). The chimney meta-attribute analysis described above
therefore represents a powerful method to discern subtle patterns
of gas-related attenuation and their spatial relationships with the
surrounding structure and stratigraphy in areas of focused ﬂuid ﬂow
(Kluesner and Brothers, 2016; Prouty et al., 2020).
2.6 Methane-derived authigenic carbonates
Powdered carbonate samples for stable carbon (δ13C) and
oxygen (δ18O) isotopic analysis were collected using a hand-held
pneumatic drill to sample various components of authigenic
carbonates collected along the Cascadia margin as a proxy for
potential ﬂuid sources. Isotopic composition was determined via

spectrometer (IRMS) at the University of California, Santa Cruz,
Stable Isotope Laboratory. Stable isotope values are reported in per
mil (‰) relative to the international reference Pee Dee Belemnite
(PDB). Analytical uncertainties (1σ) are 0.05‰ for δ13C and 0.10‰
for δ18O. Mineralogy was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD)
using a Philips XRD with graphite monochromator at 40 kV and
45 mA as described in Prouty et al. (2016). Step scans were run from
5° to 65° 2θ with 0.02° steps, using CuKα radiation and a count time
of 2 s per step following Hein et al. (2013). XRD digital scan data
were analyzed using the Philips X’Pert High Score search-and-
match function to identify minerals. The XRD 100 intensity
peaks at 20 for calcite: 29.4, dolomite: 30.8, quartz: 26.6, and
aragonite: 26.2 in order to determine major (>25%) carbonate
phase. Results from new analysis were combined with previously
published results from Cascadia (Torres et al., 2009).
3 Results
3.1 Margin-wide and regional seep
distribution
Margin-wide seep depth distribution is shown in Figure 2, based
on results from the smoothed density estimation curve of seep sites
per 100 m depth intervals overlaid on the relative percent-area
surveyed of each depth contour (Table 1). The MBES survey
coverages varies with depth and is lowest in the very shallow
water on the continental shelf from 0 to 200 m, where the
narrowing of the swath width makes collecting large surface
areas exceedingly difﬁcult for the typical MBES systems. In most
other depth bins, however, coverage is between 60%–95%. The
margin-wide seep depth distribution is left-skewed with bimodal
peaks at 200–300 m and 500–600 m and long-tailed showing
numerous observations of deep seeps up to 3,100 m. Non-
normality of the distribution was conﬁrmed using normal Q-Q
plots, which show signiﬁcant deviation of the sample points from the
linear model especially in the lower and upper quantiles, and a
Shapiro-Wilk
test
(W=0.5457,
p-value<0.05;
Supplementary
Figure S2).
Given that margin-wide plots of seep depth distribution can
mask along-margin variation in seep depth trends, we evaluated the
depth
distribution
of
the
seep
emission
sites
within
four
morphotectonic regions of the Cascadia margin (Watt and
Brothers, 2020). The depth-distribution of each of the four
morphotectonic regions shows considerable variation (Figure 3),
especially
compared
to
the
margin-wide
depth
distribution
(Figure 2). In addition to displaying the median and quartiles
(i.e., inset box-and-whisker plots), the violin plots use a kernel
density estimation to show the distribution shape of the data
(i.e., position and relative amplitude) and probability of seep
distribution along the depth range (Table 1). In regions 1 and 2,

39%–42% of seeps are found on shallow continental shelf (0–200 m),
with 23%–26% on the upper slope and landward limit of the GHSZ
(200–500 m), and 35% found in deeper waters and within the GHSZ
(>500 m) (Figure 3). In region 3, 42% are located on the upper slope
up to the landward limit of GHSZ, characterized by an interquartile
range of 300–600 m, but equally 42% are found within the GHSZ,
and a smaller portion on the shelf (15%). In contrast, seeps in region
4 were found in deeper water, such that 68% of the seeps are within
the GHSZ (interquartile range = 600–1,000 m), 15% on the upper
slope and landward limit GHSZ, and the remaining 17% on the shelf.
In summary, only the median seep depth in region 3 coincides with
the depth range of the landward limit GHSZ. The probability of
seeps occurring within the depth range of the landward limit GHSZ
is only valid in region 3. In contrast, the median seep depth in
regions 1 and 2 are shallower with respect to the landward limit of
the GHSZ and deeper in region 4, suggesting a margin-wide seep
distribution trend toward deeper water southward along the margin
(Figure 3). Similar to the margin-wide analysis, seep depth-
distribution displayed non-normality in each of the respective
regions,
as
highlighted
by
the

plots
(i.e., multimodal data distribution), illustrating scatter rather than
concentrated around the median (Figure 3). This nonuniform
distribution is consistent with previous observations (Johnson
et al., 2015; Riedel et al., 2018).
3.2 Cluster analysis
Testing for patterns in spatial distribution margin-wide revealed
that seeps exhibit spatial clustering, as opposed to random or
dispersed distributions. Along the margin seven distinct clusters
(i.e., hot spots) of high-density seeps were identiﬁed (Figure 3). All of
the major clusters, except the cluster at Heceta Bank, are in areas
where the OAH and landward limit of the GHZS coincide (Figure 3),
as discussed in more detail below. In region 1, a single cluster was
identiﬁed from 200 to 900 m depth at the head of Nitinat Canyon. At
this site the OAH and the landward limit of the GHSZ converge
(Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure S4), in contrast to the majority
of region 1 where the landward limit of the GHSZ has a seaward
offset relative to the OAH (Supplementary Figure S3). Region
2 exhibited the highest incidence of clusters, where each of the
three clusters occurred at the heads of major submarine canyons,
Quinault and Quillayute, Grays, and Astoria Canyons, that incise the
shelf at 200 m. However, seeps in Astoria Canyon extend into the
canyon and occur at a range of depths along the canyon thalweg. In
contrast to regions 1 and 2, region 3 is devoid of canyons and clusters
in this region occur on local structural highs, at Cascade Bench and
Heceta Bank. In addition, the highest probability (i.e., peak in kernel
density estimation curve) of seeps occurring within the depth range
of the landward limit GHSZ is only valid in region 3, as discussed in
detail below. A cluster at Coquille Bank was identiﬁed in region
4 where the OAH and landward limit of the GHSZ converge.
Notably, this cluster is located where an inferred backstop
boundary fault (Watt and Brothers, 2020) intersects a unique
seaﬂoor seep characterized by gas bubbles containing mantle-
derived helium suspected to be sourced from the subducting
Gorda plate (Baumberger et al., 2018). In comparison, no cluster
was detected directly offshore Coos Bay, despite convergence of the
OAH and the landward limit of the GHSZ. However, pockmarks
were observed in the bathymetry in this area, suggesting potential
ﬂuid seepage in the past. South of Rogue Canyon, the OAH deviates

seaward to a depth range of 800 to 2,000 m, where seeps appear to be
strongly associated with the OAH rather than the landward limit of
the GHSZ (Figure 3). A second cluster was identiﬁed around the
head of Eel Canyon at the southern terminus of the Cascadia margin
and is also where the OAH rejoins with the landward limit of GHSZ.
3.3 Seep site geomorphology in southern
Cascadia
The seep depth distribution in southern Cascadia is unique, as
captured in the violin plot of region 4 (Figure 3), where most seeps
(62%) occur within the GHSZ (>500 m deep), and in an area where
there is a distinct seaward divergence of the OAH into deeper water
(Supplementary Figure S3). Given the lack of overlap between the
OAH and landward limit of the GHSZ in southern Cascadia, the
deeper distribution of seeps was investigated in the context of site
speciﬁc geologic-geomorphic controls. Seeps could have associations
with multiple geologic-geomorphic attributes and were therefore
assigned up to two primary attributes (Supplementary Table S2). Of
the seven types of geologic-geomorphic attributes evaluated for
facilitating ﬂuid ﬂow, more than half (52%) of the 278 seep
emission sites in southern Cascadia occur on anticlines, with the
majority of anticlines located within or seaward of the OAH
(Figure 3). In comparison, 16% of seeps were associated with
canyons, 14% with the shelfbreak, 11% with seaﬂoor failure
scarps, 7% in channels or gullies, and 7% at sites of bedding
outcrop. While assigning site speciﬁc geologic attributes to all
seeps on the Cascadia margin is outside the current scope of the
study, we did ﬁnd that 44% of the seep emission sites in region
3 were located on anticlines, suggesting the strong association of
seeps on anticlines carries to morpho-tectonic regions other than
region 4.
3.4 Fluid-ﬂow pathways
To further investigate the link between the occurrence of
seaﬂoor seepage and underlying geologic structure in southern
Cascadia,
we
combined
high-resolution
bathymetry,
water-
column, and two-dimensional MCS data at two seep ﬂare sites in
region 4 as representative examples of detection of gas reservoirs and
ﬂuid migration pathways. The ﬁrst example is based on water-
column data from 2018 NOAA Ship Rainier MBES survey, where
three seep ﬂares were detected at ~638 m depth, with ﬂuid emissions
reaching a height of 260 m above the seaﬂoor (Figure 4A).

carbonate precipitation. The seaﬂoor morphology is mostly likely
controlled by a broad anticlinal structure, as depicted in the MCS
data (line 39 from the R/V Coral Sea). Within the anticline and
beneath the active seep there is a zone of chaotic reﬂections and
acoustic wipe-out located below the hinge line (Figure 4B). Chimney
analysis reveals a broad high-probability zone below the seep ﬁeld,
indicating probable ﬂuid-pathways (Figure 4B). Additional pipe-like
zones of disturbance on both sides of the seep ﬁeld are also
highlighted as high-probability chimney zones. Fluids appear to
be focused toward the hinge line where vertical pipes or faults
provide a pathway to the seaﬂoor, resulting in seaﬂoor emissions.
The second example is from a seep site identiﬁed from water-
column data derived from a 2017 E/V Nautilus MBES survey at a

Bathymetric shaded relief reveals uplifted and rough seaﬂoor
character underneath seep cluster. As depicted in the MCS data
(line 38 from the R/V Rachel Carson), this seep site is above a normal
fault on the ﬂank of a broad anticlinal structure (Figure 5B). As
described above, chimney analysis indicates the presence of probable
ﬂuid-pathways beneath a hydrate cap (BSR) and likely updip ﬂuid
migration through a chimney zone to the seaﬂoor (Figure 5B). The
seismic proﬁle shows that at depth, disruption of the BSR coincides
with the location of a deeper fault, as well as the presence of a relic
(“double”) BSR.
3.5 Authigenic carbonates
Authigenic carbonate δ13C values range from −56.73‰ to
10.03‰ with an average value of −25.21‰ ± 15.39‰ (n=324),
whereas δ18O values range from −1.85‰–9.15‰ with an average
value of −3.70‰ ± 1.67‰ (n=324) (Supplementary Table S3).
Aragonite is the dominant carbonate phase of the authigenic
carbonates and is the major component in 57% of the samples,
with low and high-Mg calcite accounting for 29% and dolomite
present at 13%. There is a δ13C range of over 60‰ from samples
collected along the margin, and δ13C values correlate with both
depth and latitude, with statistically signiﬁcant (p<0.01) Pearson-
Product Correlation Coefﬁcient (p<0.01) of −0.49 and −0.48,
respectively. In contrast, no correlation was found between
authigenic carbonate δ18O values with either depth or latitude.
Based on the aragonite-temperature equation of Grossman and
Ku (1986) and seawater δ18O value of 0.08‰ SMOW (Bohrmann
et al., 1998), the average δ18O-derived temperature is 5.0°C ± 3.7°C,
overlapping with CTD bottom water temperatures at a depth range
between 150 and 1,600 m (Baker and Prouty, 2022; Prouty and
Baker, 2022).
4 Discussion
4.1 Margin-wide seep depth distribution and
cluster analysis
The identiﬁcation of new seep sites in central and southern
Cascadia in this study extends our understanding of seep depth
distribution along a subducting margin. The margin-wide depth
distribution presented here is consistent with other ﬁndings that
seep density peaks around 500-m depth (Merle et al., 2021), but the
non-normality
contradicts
the
assumption
of
symmetrical
probability distribution around ~500 m. Instead of exhibiting
symmetrical probability distribution around ~500 m, the margin-
wide depth distribution is left-skewed with a long-tail highlighting
numerous observations of deep seeps up to 3,100 m. On a regional
basis, the probability of seeps occurring within the depth range of the
landward limit GHSZ is only valid in region 3 (Figure 3). While the
seep distribution is non-random, the clustering described above is
not restricted to the 500-m isobath but rather at distinct clusters with
unique geologic and geomorphic characteristics. Whereas Merle
et al. (2021) normalized seeps to percent area mapped for only a
subset of eight multibeam surveys, we normalized seep occurrence to
area mapped using all the co-located footprints from 30 multibeam
surveys. Between 200–1,500 m depth, MBES mapping coverage was
consistently
high
(80%–95%),
such
that
our
results
and
interpretation were not signiﬁcantly hindered by data gaps in
survey coverage at different depth bins. Increasing multibeam
data acquisition in the 0–200 m water depth range would further
reﬁne our estimation of seep density in shallow waters along the
margin. The opportunistic discovery of seeps and seep-indicators
(i.e., chemosynthetic biota) using ROVs at sites where MBES did not
detect seeps is a reminder that, in addition to the temporal
ephemerality of seeps releasing detectable gas bubbles, an absence
of seeps recorded in MBES surveyed area does not indicate a true
absence of seeps.
In regions 1 and 2, the majority of seeps are on the shallow
continental shelf (<200 m), with the seep clusters at the heads of
canyons in northern Cascadia (Figure 3). Given that the canyons
incise the shelf at (or less than) 200 m, it is not surprising that seeps
in regions 1 and 2 have the highest probability of occurring at depths
less than 200, consistent with previous observations (Johnson et al.,
2019). Seep clusters are located at the heads of major submarine
canyons except in Astoria Canyon, where seeps span a depth range
from 109 to 300 m at the canyon head to 480–1,026 m in the canyon.
As suggested by Merle et al. (2021), the large seep distribution in
Astoria is likely linked to a combination of factors, with Astoria
Canyon deeply incising into the shelf, resulting in steep canyon
walls, facilitating massive sidewall and channel levee failures and
exposing bedding planes on the mid to lower slope (Hill et al., 2022),
thus promoting seepage pathways within the permeable sediment
layers. In addition to a high occurrence of seep clusters in canyons in
region 2, this region is also characterized by landward migration of
the OAH, most likely in response to active extensional faulting. As a
result, the OAH overlaps with the landward limit of the GHSZ
(Figure 3), which most likely further facilitates focused ﬂuid in these
clusters.
Seep depth distribution in the south is progressively deeper but
also signiﬁes the only region (region 3) devoid of canyons and where
the probability of seeps occurring within the depth range of the
landward limit GHSZ is valid (Figure 3). The predominant cluster in
region 3 is at Cascade Bench, a topographic high situated between
Cascade Head and Tillamook Bay at depth of 400–600 m and
inferred to be a paleo–shelf edge formed during the Pleistocene
lowstand (McNeill et al., 2000). A second cluster was identiﬁed at
Heceta Bank, a structural high along the outer shelf caused by
subducting seamounts (Tréhu et al., 2012). Within this region, the
OAH is co-located with the landward limit of the GHSZ except at
Heceta Bank, suggesting some discrepancy of cluster behavior on
structural highs with regards to convergence of the OAH and
landward limit of the GHSZ.
The overlap between the OAH and the landward limit of the
GHSZ may help explain the occurrence of the two clusters in region
4, one at Rogue Canyon and Coquille Bank, a north-south trending
double plunging, asymmetrical anticline (Kulm and Bales, 1969),
and the other around the head of Eel Canyon. Both sites are places
where the OAH and landward limit of the GHSZ converge, along
with the presence of submarine canyon heads (the importance of

which was discussed above). Seaﬂoor ﬂuid emission at Coquille
Bank may also be further facilitated by a backstop fault formed from
the subducting Gorda Plate (Watt and Brothers, 2020) with access to
mantle-derived ﬂuids (Baumberger et al., 2018), and associated with
a maﬁc ridge buried beneath the sediments of the accretionary
complex from about 43° to 45°N (Fleming and Tréhu, 1999). In the
rest of region 4, the OAH and the landward limit of the GHSZ are
separated from each other by an average of 23 ± 6.1 km as the OAH
deviates seaward around the Eel River Basin. As noted in this study,
many seeps occurred in the deep water in association with the OAH,
and proliﬁc seep activity was also observed proximal to the channel
heads of Trinidad Canyon where a north-south trending fault cuts
across the channel heads and the shelfbreak (Balster-Gee et al.,
2023a), but there was a dearth of seeps in the basin between. We
posit that the lack of seeps here may be due to high sedimentation
rates in the Eel River Basin that cause deposition of mud and silt to
drape over the Basin and Trinidad Canyon (Nittrouer, 1999;
Sommerﬁeld and Nittrouer, 1999), which may limit sufﬁcient
poreﬂuid methane saturation. Whereas gas hydrates tend to
concentrate in coarser-grained sandy/silty turbidite sediments
(Torres et al., 2008), high sedimentation rate of ﬁne-grained
sediment may preclude sufﬁcient poreﬂuid methane saturation.
This scenario is consistent with observations by Tréhu and
Phrampus (2022) to explain the absence of BSR and extension of
the seaward edge of the Eel River Basin well to the west of the
theoretical landward edge of the GHSZ. Therefore, we suggest that

(OAH) in (A) uninterpreted, (B) interpreted migrated industry seismic proﬁle, Line W675NC-524 (Triezenberg et al., 2016). The OAH in this region forms a
broad structural high (10s of km wide) comprised of numerous imbricated thrust faults and associated folds. The OAH bounds the seaward edge of the
forearc basin. The seaﬂoor multiple is indicated by “m”. (C) shows a conceptual model depicting the OAH as a ﬁrst-order anticlinal trap that focuses
ﬂuid ﬂow along individual faults and bedding planes. Note that within this region the outer arc high and upper limit of hydrate stability are spatially distinct
features that each play an important role in focusing ﬂuid seepage at the seaﬂoor. Depth of Franciscan basement is estimated based on nearby
interpretations from Gulick et al. (2002).

the lack of overlap between the OAH and the landward limit of the
GHSZ and sedimentation history precludes development of seep
cluster anywhere else in region 4.
The discussion above provides an interpretive framework for
understanding and potentially predicting seep clusters along a
subducting margin and helps address the unresolved origin of
seeps at 500 m by identifying processes and characteristics that
facilitate focused ﬂuid independently of gas hydrate dissociation in
response to contemporary ocean warming. While canyons and
structural highs are critical geomorphic features facilitating seep
occurrence, overlap between the OAH and the landward limit of the
GHSZ may be required for statistically signiﬁcant clustering of seep
emissions. In Cascadia, there is co-occurrence of the OAH (and shelf
break) with the downdip end of seismic ruptures and interseismic
coupling (McNeill et al., 2000; Booth-Rea et al., 2008; Malatesta
et al., 2021). Therefore, there may be links between seep distribution
and seismogenic patterns given the release and drainage of ﬂuids
from clay dehydration in the transition between locked and
seismogenic zone (Saffer and Tobin, 2011). Low permeability and
porosity of marine sediment could lead to signiﬁcant overpressure in
these environments and trapping of ﬂuids (Sahling et al., 2008; Saffer
and Tobin, 2011). In other words, there is upward/updip ﬂuid
migration from zones of peak dehydration and/or elevated pore
pressure toward that OAH along permeable stratigraphic layers and
fault conduits. The OAH acts as a ﬁrst-order anticlinal trap that
focuses ﬂuid ﬂow along individual faults and bedding plane
(Figure 6), as supported by sub-surface data showing where
widespread folds channel ﬂuids and gases toward the anticlinal
crests, as seen in the structurally controlled seeps offshore Costa Rica
(Kluesner et al., 2013). This may not apply to seeps away from the
deformation front since dehydration may occur at a shallow depth
and near the deformation front (Hyndman and Wang, 1993;
Hyndman, 2007), given the high temperatures of the very young
hot subducting plate (e.g., Hyndman, 2007). In contrast, near
Hydrate Ridge, Torres et al. (2004) and Teichert et al. (2005)
found an increase in deep freshening eastward (i.e., relative to
the toe), whereas accretion at the westernmost sites is too recent
for the sediments to have undergone signiﬁcant illitization. While
differentiating
ﬂuids
from
dehydration
relative
to
hydrate
dissociation requires analysis of poreﬂuids, the co-location of the
seep clusters with the OAH and inferred downdip end of
interseismic coupling in Cascadia is intriguing and warrants
further investigation.
4.2 Fluid source
As a proxy for the composition of ﬂuids, the authigenic
carbonate isotope values suggest a range of sources, including
thermogenic decomposition of organic matter and biogenic
mediation from microbial activity (Claypool et al., 1985). The
average authigenic carbonate δ13C values (−53.53‰ ± 1.95‰) at
the Astoria deep sites (>800 m) are depleted relative to carbonate
δ13C values at the shallow site (500 m; −28.51‰ ± 2.26‰), yielding a
difference of 25‰, similar in magnitude between gas samples at the
shallow versus deeper Astoria sites (Baumberger et al., 2018). As
described in Baumberger et al. (2018), anerobic oxidation of
methane (AOM), as well as incorporation of dissolved inorganic
carbon (DIC) and co-existing CO2 and its associated shift in isotope
composition, can produce heavy δ13C values that mimic a
thermogenic origin (Pohlman et al., 2009). Given gas isotopic
and hydrocarbon composition indicative microbial methane at
Astoria (Baumberger et al., 2018), the heavier carbonate δ13C
values at the shallow site are in line with 13C-enrichment by AOM.
In contrast, at Coquille the presence of only thermogenic
methane (Collier and Lilley, 2005; Baumberger et al., 2018)
provides an opportunity to calibrate the range in carbonate δ13C
values (−26.50 to −17.76‰) in the absence of mixing with microbial
sources. Taken together, data from Coquille and Astoria can be used
as endmember values for estimating contribution from microbial
and thermogenic methane sources to carbonate δ13C values at other
sites where both sources are identiﬁed, such as at Heceta Bank
(Baumberger et al. (2018). For example, carbonate δ13C values
greater than the range reported at Coquille can be explained by
oxidation of methane and DIC incorporation, whereas carbonate
δ13C values less than this range reﬂect mixing with microbial
methane. Assuming endmember microbial and thermogenic δ13C
values from Baumberger et al. (2018), mixing with a microbial
methane at Heceta Bank could contribute to a depletion of 15‰,
equivalent to a contribution of less than 10% from microbial
methane.
The inverse correlation between δ13C values and depth supports
earlier views that seeps from within the gas hydrate stability zone are
of microbial origin and seeps from the upper slope and the shelf have
a thermogenic source (e.g., Collier and Lilley, 2005; Heeschen et al.,
2005; Baumberger et al., 2018). However, the discussion above also
demonstrates how processes impacting ﬂuid chemistry, such as
mixing and AOM, can impact the ﬂuid isotopic composition
(Pohlman et al., 2009) and ultimately alter the archived ﬂuid-
source signature in the authigenic carbonates. In addition, gas
hydrate
dissociation
can
provide
a
potential
source
of
18O-enriched ﬂuids, which releases hydrate water and contributes
to enrichment by up to 3.5‰ (Maekawa, 2004). Samples with
18O-enriched
carbonate
values
yield
unrealistically
cold
temperatures (<2°C) relative to CTD bottom water data (Baker
and Prouty, 2022; Prouty and Baker, 2022), indicating inﬂuence
from 18O-enriched ﬂuid source. Margin-wide carbonate δ18O values
and mineralogy, however, support shallow precipitation of aragonite
driven by AOM and in isotopic equilibrium with seawater.
4.3 Anticlines as trappings for focused
ﬂuid ﬂow
While the occurrence of seep clusters and the justiﬁcation for
their distribution may help explain the spatial distribution of seeps
along the Cascadia margin, it does not explain the range or
probability of seep depth distribution across the four regions.
Instead,
the
site-speciﬁc
investigation
of
region
4
reveals
quantitative links between seaﬂoor geomorphology/geology and
seep occurrence. As reported above, over half of the seeps in
region 4 occur on anticlines. This characteristic of region 4 helps
to explain the probability depth distribution of seeps within the
GHSZ. As shown in Figure 3 the OAH diverges seaward,
representing a unique feature of southern Cascadia not observed
elsewhere along the margin. According to Tréhu and Phrampus
Frontiers in Earth Science
frontiersin.org
11
Rudebusch et al.
10.3389/feart.2023.1205211
(2022), this region is also marked by the greatest distance between
the landward-most BSR pick and 500 m contour (Supplementary
Figure S4). Given that the OAH is an actively deforming portion of
the margin, younger anticlines are formed from west to east
(i.e., seaward or within the OAH) by uplift and horizonal
compression as the deformation front steps seaward (Carson
et al., 1974; McNeill et al., 1999; McCrory et al., 2002). In this
region, the BSR is also tens of km seaward of the landward limit of
the GHSZ where accretion of trench sediments forms a thick
accretionary wedge (Tréhu and Phrampus, 2022). This spatial
pattern highlights the potential role of the OAH on not only
seep distribution but hydrate formation, where accretionary
wedge tectonics and seaﬂoor morphology serve as structural
controls on ﬂuid reservoirs, trapping, and transport. The 2-D
conceptual model shown in Figure 6 demonstrates ﬂuid ﬂow
paths and seaﬂoor seepage features that are dependent on folds
and fault patterns. Whereas convergence rates are similar along the
Cascadia margin, the structural style and width of the actively
deforming outer wedge varies along-strike, with a narrower
wedge in the south relative to wider wedge in the north (Watt
and Brothers, 2020). As a result, the narrower wedge forms a steeper
accretionary prism with closely spaced faults/anticlines that stack on
top of one another (i.e., imbricate faulting). In contrast, the wide
wedge in northern Cascadia forms widely spaced anticlines. Region
3 is also characterized by a relatively high occurrence of seeps on
anticlines characterized by mixed or dual vergence (Watt and
Brothers, 2020), resulting in more-symmetrical fold structures
and steeper seaﬂoor gradients along the fold limbs evident in
seismic data (Booth-Rea et al., 2008; Phrampus et al., 2017).
The occurrence of seeps on anticlines follows the conceptual
models of focused ﬂuid ﬂow and gas migration along the crest of an
anticline described by Paull et al. (2008), such as observed offshore
north Panama (Reed et al., 1990), Costa Rica (Kluesner et al., 2013),
and along the Queen Charlotte Fault (Prouty et al., 2020), where
folding, thrust faulting, and sedimentation along a deformation
front
may
facilitate
ﬂuid
ﬂow
and
seaﬂoor
venting.
This
relationship has been previously noted on the Cascadia margin,
where the development of anticlinal ridges controls the location of
seepage and are strongly correlated with vertical ﬂuid migration
paths (Carson et al., 1991; Carson et al., 1994; Johnson et al., 2003).
Similarly, Tréhu et al. (1999) speculated positive feedback between
gas hydrate formation and anticlines. Merle et al. (2021) also noted
that
deeper
seeps
(>525 m)
were
coincident
with
major
compressional
anticlinal
(and
diapiric
ridges)
within
the
accretionary prism. The efﬁciency of anticlines to trap and focus
ﬂuid ﬂow is clearly seen in the MSC data and chimney analysis
(Figures 4, 5), where broad high-probability zones of ﬂuid migration
and areas of chaotic reﬂections and acoustic wipe-out are located
below the anticline hinge line. At depth, disruption of the BSR
coincides with the location of a deeper fault, which is likely
channeling
ﬂuids
and
causing
breakdown
of
the
hydrate
cap. Upon intersecting the ﬁrst fault up-dip, the gas/ﬂuid
presumably migrates upward along a path of least resistance to
the seaﬂoor. The seismic proﬁle also shows the presence of a relic
(“double”) BSR (Figure 5), possibly caused by episodes of uplift
leading to shoaling/reestablishment of the BSR due to changing
thermal conditions. This analysis also illustrates how faults disrupt
the BSR (and presumably hydrate stability) and provide a pathway
for ﬂuids and gas to reach the seaﬂoor, resulting in seaﬂoor
emissions. Hydraulic fracturing can also serve as a gas conduit.
For example, along the southern Hikurangi margin in Aotearoa/
New Zealand, anticlines act as a focusing mechanism for the ﬂuids,
where there is sufﬁcient upward pressure to overcome the lithostatic
load of the overburden and blow-out, or fracture, leading to a
vertical pathway to the seaﬂoor (Crutchley et al., 2021).
4.4 Tectonic framework for seep distribution
Taken together, this quantitative approach has identiﬁed
characteristics/features as well as processes along the margin that
facilitate seep emissions that operate independently of gas hydrate
dissociation in response to contemporary ocean warming. In doing
so, this study provides an expanded interpretive framework for
understanding the controls and inﬂuencing factors on the depth and
spatial distribution of seeps along the Cascadia margin and is
consistent with stable gas hydrate occurrences even under future
scenarios of warming bottom waters (Ruppel, 2011; Ruppel and
Kessler, 2017). This interpretive framework may also be applied to
other subduction margins that are dominated by accretion, such as
the southern Hikurangi margin offshore Aotearoa/New Zealand
(Barnes et al., 2010), where high ﬂuid pressures play an important
role in maintaining thrust wedges (Saffer and Bekins, 2002). For
example, the majority of seeps on the southern Hikurangi margin
were detected on crests of thrust-faulted anticlinal ridges at
700–1,200 m and where a network of near-surface faults and
chimneys facilitates ﬂuid expulsion and a breakdown in BSR
(Mountjoy et al., 2009a; Barnes et al., 2010; Law et al., 2010;
Crutchley et al., 2018; Watson et al., 2020). While seeps along
the
Hikurangi
margin
are
consistently
located
above
the
deforming backstop, seep distribution based on MBES water
column backscatter data is not uniform, and similar to the
Cascadia margin, no evidence was found to suggest clustering of
seeps near the landward limit of the GHSZ (650 m; Supplementary
Figure S5). Instead, seeps in the north are concentrated near the shelf
break within the Tuaheni Landslide Complex, where a combination
of factors have contributed to slope instability, including earthquake
ground shaking and gas release (Mountjoy et al., 2009b; Mountjoy
et al., 2014; Gross et al., 2018; Carey et al., 2022; Crutchley et al.,
2022). In comparison, seeps in the south occupy deeper water depths
and are found to cluster along the crests of parallel ridges
(Supplementary Figure S6), where gas is trapped beneath large
sedimentary folds/anticlines formed by deep-seated thrust faults,
and focused ﬂuid ﬂow is facilitated by both faults and hydraulic
fractures (Crutchley et al., 2021).
This comparison highlights the role of regional geologic
structures inﬂuencing clusters of focused ﬂuid ﬂow, as well as
detailing margin-wide variability in seep distribution along both
margins. For example, the largest depth range of seeps is located in
the relatively narrow southern end of both margins where there is a
transition from subduction to strike-slip deformation (Barnes et al.,
2010; Watt and Brothers, 2020). At this transition, strike-slip faults
that trend across the slope (Gulick et al., 2002) may provide
additional near-vertical pathways for ﬂuid ﬂow across a range of
water depths. The importance of the geometry of geologic structures
to inﬂuence spatial location and character of seeps has been

previously documented (Kulm et al., 1986; Le Pichon et al., 1992).
However, results from our study, which demonstrate the importance
of both geometry of geologic structures and the role of the margin-
wide morphotectonics, may expand previous models of the
distribution of ﬂuid expulsion along subduction zones.
5 Conclusion
By applying a spatial and statistical analysis to an expanded
seep database, coupled with multibeam bathymetry and chimney
meta-attribute analysis of seismic reﬂection proﬁles, we show that
gas hydrate stability is one of many other controls, primarily
morphologic and tectonic, on seep distribution in Cascadia.
Seep distribution along the margin is non-random, but instead
of clustering along the 500-m isobath, seep clusters are dominated
by the presence of canyons and topographical highs. New ﬁndings
from this study suggest that co-location of the outer arc high
(OAH) and landward limit of the gas hydrate stability zone
(GHSZ) may be a prerequisite for seep cluster development in
Cascadia, where a broad area of deformation overlaps a zone where
hydrates are particularly vulnerable to dissociation, such as in
areas with focused uplift and in headward-eroding canyons. The
wide range in seep depth distribution, and in particular the trend
toward deeper depths in southern Cascadia can also be linked to
the location of the OAH where the development of thrust-faulted
anticlines along the seaward edge of the Eel River forearc basin
plays a crucial role in facilitating focused ﬂuid ﬂow and seep
emissions despite being within the GHSZ. Reﬁning models of ﬂuid
expulsion is critical, given the importance of ﬂuid ﬂow on plate
boundary seismogenesis, global carbon budgets, and supporting
sensitive seaﬂoor ecosystems.
