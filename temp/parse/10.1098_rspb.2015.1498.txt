Ecologically important traits do not evolve without limits. Instead, evolution
is constrained by the set of available and viable phenotypes. In particular,
natural selection may only favour a narrow range of adaptive optima con-
strained within selective regimes. Here, I integrate data with theory to test
whether selection explains phenotypic constraint. A global database of 599
plant species from 94 families shows that stomatal ratio, a trait affecting
photosynthesis and defence against pathogens, is highly constrained. Most
plants have their stomata on the lower leaf surface (hypostomy), but species
with half their stomata on each surface (amphistomy) form a distinct mode
in the trait distribution. A model based on a trade-off between maximizing
photosynthesis and a fitness cost of upper stomata predicts a limited number
of adaptive solutions, leading to a multimodal trait distribution. Phylo-
genetic comparisons show that amphistomy is the most common among
fast-growing species, supporting the view that CO2 diffusion is under
strong selection. These results indicate that selective optima stay within a
relatively stable set of selective regimes over macroevolutionary time.
1. Introduction
What determines the major features of phenotypic evolution [1,2]? When selection
predominates, the topography of the macroevolutionary adaptive landscape—a
‘map’ of phenotype to fitness—determines the broad patterns of life’s diversity
[3]. In particular, a limited number of adaptive solutions corresponding to distinct
selective regimes should result in convergent evolution of similar phenotypes
across independent evolutionary lineages. In such cases, surveys across species
should reveal a multimodal trait distribution in which the modes point to the
underlying selective regimes. Multimodality has been observed frequently
among plants and animals, including traits such as self-incompatibility [4], the
precocial–altricial spectrum [5], pollination syndromes [6], ecomorphology in
Anolis [7] and plant height [8]. That such disparate classes of traits show broadly
similar patterns suggests that partially discrete selective regimes may be a general
feature of macroevolution. However, we rarely know whether multimoda-
lity reflects constraints imposed by selection and not some other constraint on
phenotypic evolution.
In particular, certain phenotypes may be common not because they are more
fit, but rather because they are genetically, developmentally or functionally acces-
sible. Conversely, rare phenotypes might be inaccessible. Since the term
‘constraint’ is not used consistently in biology, I specifically follow the definitions
given by Arnold [9]: genetic constraints are limitations set by the ‘pattern of genetic
variation and covariation for a set of traits’ [p. S86]; developmental constraints are
limitations on ‘possible developmental states’ [p. S95] and functional constraints
are imposed by ‘time, energy or the laws of physics’ [p. S97]. Arnold contrasts
these with selective constraints determined by the adaptive landscape. There are
examples of genetic [10], developmental [11] and functional [12] constraints on
phenotypic evolution acting in nature, meaning that we cannot assume selection
alone shapes trait evolution. Compelling evidence from cross-species comparisons
that selection constrains phenotypic evolution requires showing that phenotypic

evolution is constrained, that selection is sufficient to explain
the inferred constraint and that non-selective constraints are
inconsistent with these observations.
Here, I evaluate evidence for selective constraints on a
functionally important plant trait, stomatal ratio (SR), using
comparative methods and theory. SR, defined as the ratio of
upper to lower stomatal density, impacts how plants assimilate
CO2 from the atmosphere via photosynthesis. Physiological
experiments and biophysical theory demonstrate that amphis-
tomatous leaves, those that have equal stomatal densities on
both upper and lower surfaces, maximize photosynthetic rate
by minimizing the distance between substomatal cavities and
chloroplasts, facilitating rapid CO2 diffusion [13–16]. Hence,
nearly all plants should be amphistomatous to maximize
photosynthesis, yet paradoxically up to 90% of plant species
in some communities are hypostomatous [17–20], meaning
that most stomata are on the lower surface. In rare cases,
most stomata are on the upper surface (hyperstomy). I use
upper and lower rather than abaxial and adaxial, because pos-
ition relative to the ground, rather than to the stem, best
explains patterns across both normal and ‘upside-down’
(i.e. resupinate) leaves. SR is a quantitative metric that describes
continuous variation between hypo- and hyperstomy.
Multiple lines of evidence indicate selection on SR, but there
is little consensus on the adaptive significance. SRvaries widely,
but non-randomly [13,17,19,21–23] and evolves rapidlyin some
taxa, possibly owing to selection [24,25]. Several environmental
and anatomical factors have been hypothesized to favour
amphistomy (table 1). The mechanistic details and literature
underlying these hypotheses and predictions are described in
the electronic supplementary material, appendix S1. The pre-
ponderance of hypostomy almost certainly reflects a cost of
upper stomata. For example, hypostomy has evolved anew in
resupinate leaves [31]. Upper stomata might be costly because
they increase susceptibility to foliar pathogens (e.g. rust fungi)
that infect through stomata [15], suggesting that SR mediates a
trade-off between photosynthetic rate and defence [24], but
other costs have been proposed (electronic supplementary
material, appendix S1). Identifying the selective forces (i.e. fit-
ness benefits and costs) shaping SR have been hampered by
four methodological limitations. Namely, previous studies
were typically qualitative rather than quantitative, confined to
specific geographical regions or clades, did not account for phy-
logenetic non-independence or did not take into account
multiple confounding factors. To overcome these limitations, I
assembled a quantitative, global and phylogeneticallyextensive
database that disentangles correlated predictor variables (e.g.
light level and leaf thickness).
This new dataset revealed that SR is a multimodal trait
(figure 1), strongly suggesting some form of constraint. In
other words, phenotypic values between modes are rare
either because they are selected against (selective constraint)
or rarely arise (other constraints). To test whether the observed
pattern is consistent with constraint, I modified existing evol-
utionary process models to accommodate proportion traits
like SR. Fitting this model to the data demonstrates that SR
is highly constrained by multiple selective regimes, where
selective regimes are defined as ‘the aggregate of all such
environmental and organismic factors that combine to deter-
mine how natural selection will act upon character variation’
([32, p. 4], see also [7,33]). Next, I leveraged knowledge on
the relationship between SR, photosynthesis and a cost of
upper stomata (most probably decreased resistance to foliar
pathogens) to construct a simple cost–benefit model consistent
with the underlying physics and a minimum of additional
assumptions. This model indicates that distinct selective
regimes can result from a simple trade-off between photosyn-
thesis and defence, even when the underlying ecological
gradients are smooth. By contrast, a review of the literature
does not support a primary role for genetic, developmental
and functional constraints. Finally, phylogenetic multiple
regression identifies life-history evolution as the primary selec-
tive agent underlying shifts in selective regime, but anatomical
and climatic factors are also important. By merging theory
and data, this study adduces new evidence that selection is
the primary constraint on phenotypic evolution and offers a
simple mechanistic explanation for a seemingly complex
macroevolutionary pattern.
2. Material and methods
(a) Assembling a comparative dataset
To test the hypotheses in table 1, I surveyed the literature for trait
data on SR and leaf thickness. I compiled a new, global dataset
from 25 previously published studies (electronic supplementary
material, appendix S2) containing trait data (SR and leaf thick-
ness) on 599 species across 94 plant families. I obtained
environmental data (elevation, habitat openness and precipi-
tation) from GIS layers and growth form from online databases
or primary literature. The dataset with trait and climate data
comprised a 552 species subset covering 90 families. Complete
details on how the dataset was assembled are available in the
electronic supplementary material, appendix S2.
(b) Evolutionary process model: connecting
multimodality to phenotypic constraint
I inferred constraint by comparing the fit of evolutionary process
models with and without constraint. The phenotypic optimum
under an unconstrained model evolves stochastically without
limits other than the fact that proportions are bounded between
0 and 1. By contrast, the optimum under the constrained model
varies within a limited range of values around a long-run aver-
age or ‘optimum’. I developed a new evolutionary process
model that extends the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) model for pro-
portion traits like SR that are bounded by 0 and 1. In general, OU
models infer phenotypic constraint around a long-run average
[7,33–35], but the standard OU model assumes traits are nor-
mally distributed. The new method, based on an underlying

process model derived in the electronic supplementary material,
appendix S3, assumes that proportion traits are beta-distributed
at stationarity (see Results). While the beta distribution fits pro-
portion data better than a normal distribution, it is not yet
possible to account for phylogenetic non-independence with
this method, unlike standard OU methods. Therefore, I tested
whether species rapidly approach stationarity, as assumed in
non-phylogenetic approaches, using standard OU methods to
estimate phylogenetic signal relative to the transition rate
between regimes (the next paragraph describes how regimes
were inferred). I used SIMMAP [36] in the R package phytools ver-
sion 0.4-56 [37] to estimate transition rates between regimes and
fit standard OU models to the data using the R package OUwie
version 1.45 [38] (see the electronic supplementary material,
appendix S4 for complete detail). Hereafter I refer to methods
using the new OU model for proportional traits as ‘OUbeta’ and
methods using the standard OU model as ‘OUnorm’. The limit-
ations of each approach complement each other: OUbeta uses a
good distribution for proportion traits, but is non-phylogenetic;
OUnorm uses a normal distribution, but accounts for phylogeny.
Multimodality suggests the presence of multiple regimes,
selective or non-selective, associated with different modes. I used
finite mixture models to infer the number of regimes constraining
SR evolution under the OUbeta model (see [8] for a similar
approach). That is, I assume the distribution of trait values across
species can be represented as a mixture of multiple regimes at sta-
tionarity, each of which is modelled as a beta-distributed variable.
To fit models, I used an expectation–maximization algorithm to
find the maximum-likelihood mixture model (electronic sup-
plementary material, appendix S5). I selected the best model
using the conservative Bayesian information criterion (BIC).
I accepted models with an additional regime if they decreased
BIC by two or more. I also tested for multiple regimes within
families where there were sufficient data (n  15). Ten families
met this criterion. For each family, I compared the fit of mixtures
with k ¼ 1,2 or 3 regimes using BIC. Further, I rejected additio-
nal regimes supported by BIC if one of those regimes contained
fewer than three species (this affected Poaceae and Salicaceae).
If multiple similar regimes are found repeatedly in disparate
families, this provides compelling evidence for convergent evol-
ution because of phenotypic constraints imposed by a shared set
of regimes.
(c) Cost–benefit model: can a photosynthesis–defence
trade-off account for constraint?
I used theory to ask whether multiple selective regimes could be
an emergent property of more fundamental fitness costs and
benefits associated with SR. Full details of the model are given
in the electronic supplementary material, appendix S6. The
model assumes a fitness benefit (denoted Bmax) and cost
(denoted Cmax) of upper stomata. Based on biophysical theory,
having stomata on both surfaces (holding total stomatal density
constant) increases photosynthetic rate. The model does not
specify a particular fitness cost of upper stomata—in fact, there
could be multiple costs—but recent evidence suggests that infec-
tion by foliar pathogens may be the main cost (electronic
supplementary material, appendix S1 discusses the fitness
benefits and costs associated with SR). For a given benefit : cost
ratio and shape of the benefit function (denoted s2), I solved
for the SR that optimizes fitness, which I denote as Sfit. The
model therefore generates fitness landscapes that relate some
environmental gradient, through variation in fitness benefits
and costs, to the fitness of different SR phenotypes. Next, I exam-
ined whether such landscapes generate a trait distribution that
qualitatively resembles the data, even when the underlying
environmental gradients are smooth. I specifically focused on
the pattern observed within families, where there was generally
one mode of amphistomatous species and another mode of
hypostomatous species (hyperstomatous in the case of Poaceae).
I generated hypothetical trait distributions by assuming that the
benefit : cost ratio varies smoothly and using different shapes of

lower surfaces). Finally, there are a small number of hyperstomatous species (all stomata on the upper surface). A mixture of selective regimes (shaded grey

model. Panel (d) breaks down the mixture density into three regimes depicted as red, blue and yellow polygons. The three-regime model fitted better (lower

appendix S6).
(d) Testing adaptive hypotheses for stomatal ratio using
phylogenetic regression
I tested whether SR varies as a function of leaf thickness, mean
annual precipitation, elevation, leaf area index (a proxy for habi-
tat openness) and growth form using type 2 phylogenetic
ANOVA with both categorical (growth form) and continuous
(e.g. leaf thickness) predictor variables. I accounted for phylo-
geny using a Phylomatic [39] megatree for this relatively large
and phylogenetically extensive dataset. Complete details on phy-
logenetic regression are in the electronic supplementary material,
appendix S2.
3. Results
(a) Stomatal ratio evolution is constrained by multiple
selective regimes
The most striking feature of the data is that SR is highly multi-
modal (figure 1), with apparent modes at 0 (hypostomatous),
0.5 (amphistomatous) and 1 (hyperstomatous). The distri-
bution of SR values across species is consistent with an
evolutionary
process
model
that
includes
constraints
imposed by multiple selective regimes. To infer regimes, I
augmented the standard OU model for proportion traits
(see the electronic supplementary material, appendix S3),
which shows that the stationary distribution of SR (or any
proportion trait) r follows a beta distribution:
f ðrÞ ¼ r2fu1ð1  rÞ2fð1uÞ1
Bð2fu, 2fð1  uÞÞ ,
ð3:1Þ
where B(.) refers to the beta function. Under the OUbeta
model, a selective regime at stationarity is characterized by
two parameters, a long-run average in the adaptive land-
scape, u, and a precision, f, around the average.
If there are a limited number of partially distinct adaptive
solutions in the world, then a model with multiple selective
regimes should fit the data better than a model with a single
regime [7,33]. Using finite mixture model analysis (electronic
supplementary material, appendix S5), I inferred three
selective regimes (electronic supplementary material, table
S1), but note that the mapping between modes and regimes
is not always one-to-one. In particular, one regime produces
modes at both 0 and 1 (figure 1d). Nevertheless, the data
clearly supports the large number of hypostomatous (SR ¼ 0)
species as a distinct mode. There was also strong support for
an amphistomatous regime (compare figure 1b to 1c). Finally,
the best-supported model also included a small mode for hyper-
stomatous species and a separate, smaller regime for species
intermediate between hypo- and amphistomy (figure 1d).
The OUbeta method assumes that the trait distribution
rapidlyapproaches its stationary distribution. OUnorm methods,
which assume normally distributed traits but account for phylo-
geny, suggest that hypo- and amphistomatous regimes are close
to stationarity (electronic supplementary material, appendix
S4). Most species have spent much longer in their present-day
regime (median of 45–225 Myr depending on regime) than
the
phylogenetic
half-life
(22 Myr),
suggesting
that
the
trait distribution should be close to stationarity. However,
I caution that transition rates are rough estimates because of
sparse taxonomic sampling and failure to account for different
diversification rates associated with each regime [40].
The same general pattern seen at the global scale—
multiple selective regimes leading to distinct modes—is
recapitulated within nine of 10 families best-represented in
the global dataset (figure 2). Additional detail is given in the
electronic supplementary material, appendix S8. Species from
the one exception to this pattern (Rubiaceae) were mostly
woody (i.e. more likely to be hypostomatous, see below).
Among herbaceous Rubiaceae, there are some amphistoma-
tous species [41], suggesting a broader sample may evince
multiple modes. In summary, the apparent pattern of con-
straint on SR is strikingly similar across multiple disparate
families and at a global scale, suggesting convergent evolution
because of shared phenotypic constraint.
(b) Selection is sufficient to accommodate constraint
I analysed a cost–benefit model of SR to ask whether selec-
tion
is
sufficient
to
account
for
apparent
phenotypic
constraint. Not surprisingly, selection favours greater SR
(Sfit) as the fitness benefit of greater photosynthesis increases
relative to the cost of upper stomata (figure 3a–c), but the
shape of the function is highly sensitive to one parameter
in the model, the shape of the benefit function s2. In particu-
lar, there are a broad array of adaptive optima when s2 is
high,
but
a
much
narrower
range
when
s2
is
low
(figure 3d–f). When the range of optima is broad, intermedi-
ate
phenotypes
between
complete
hypostomy
and
amphistomy are best when the benefit : cost ratio itself is
intermediate. By contrast, when the range of adaptive
optima is narrow, intermediates are universally less fit than
either of the boundary phenotypes. As the benefit : cost
ratio decreases, there is a sudden shift from amphistomy
being favoured to hypostomy being favoured. The dearth of
species with intermediate SR in nature, especially within
families, therefore suggests either a narrow range of adaptive
optima or that there are a broad range of adaptive optima,
but that intermediate environments are rare. Numerical simu-
lations based on smooth variation in the benefit : cost ratio
indicate that the simple, yet realistic assumptions of this
model are sufficient to account for qualitatively different
selective regimes and generate patterns of multimodality
similar to those seen in nature (figure 3g–h).
(c) Growth form, leaf thickness and precipitation shape
stomatal ratio evolution
If SR is strongly associated with other traits or climatic factors,
especially if there are compelling a priori hypotheses (table 1)
supporting such associations, then it suggests that trait vari-
ation is shaped by selection. Phylogenetic multiple regression
identified growth form and, to a lesser extent, leaf thickness
and precipitation as the best predictors of SR (electronic sup-
plementary material, table S2). Amphistomy is strongly
associated
with
fast
growth
forms
(herbaceous
plants),
whereas hypostomy is most common in slower growing
shrubs and trees (figure 4). As predicted by biophysical
theory [13,15], thicker leaves also tend to be amphistomatous,
although the correlation is weak (electronic supplementary
material, figure S1a). Finally, amphistomy is more common
in dry environments, whereas hypo/hyperstomy is associated
with higher precipitation (electronic supplementary material,
rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org

figure S1b). Elevation and leaf area index, a proxy for open
habitat of leaves below the canopy, were not significantly
associated with SR in this dataset (electronic supplementary
material, table S2). In single regressions, amphistomy is more
common in open environments, as in previous studies
[14,20,21,23], but this correlation is not significant after

atop a histogram of SR from a given plant family (grey bars). Note that some distributions are very narrow spikes near the origin. n is the sample size for each

from information theoretic (BIC) comparisons of finite mixture models with beta-distributed components (k is the number of components). Lower BIC indicates
better fit. In Poaceae and Salicaeae, I rejected models with k ¼ 3 because some components had very low membership.

and leaf area index are positively correlated).
4. Discussion
This study posits that multimodal traits reveal the presence of
distinct selective regimes. Hence, the prevalence of certain
phenotypes and the dearth of others directly reflects selective
constraints on phenotypic evolution. Evidence from a new,
global dataset clearly shows that SR is a multimodal trait
(figure 1) and that multimodality has evolved repeatedly in
plants (figure 2). These patterns are difficult to reconcile with
models omitting constraint, but are consistent with multiple
selective regimes (electronic supplementary material, table S1).
This means that although the selective optimum experienced

factor s2 changes the benefit function from bell-shaped in a to an inverted-U shape in (c). Panels (d–f) show that the shape of the benefit function affects the
range of optima permitted by the adaptive landscapes. Solid lines are the SR that optimizes fitness (Sfit) as a function of the benefit : cost ratio (Bmax : Cmax). The
transition between amphistomy being favoured over hypostomy can be abrupt (d) or gradual ( f ), leading to a narrow or broad range of adaptive optima. The light
grey line indicates the range of universally unfit phenotypes. Panels (g–i) show hypothetical trait distributions assuming that the benefit : cost ratio varies uniformly
from 1022 to 102. Histograms were generated by solving for Sfit with 104 evenly spaced values of Bmax : Cmax. Note that the trait values range from hypostomatous
to amphistomatous, but a mirror image distribution with hyperstomatous species would be seen if fitness costs accrued to lower stomata.

byagiven species varies overmacroevolutionarytime,therange
of optima is highly constrained by ecological factors. In particu-
lar, the cost–benefit model shows that a trade-off between
photosynthesis and defence against pathogens is sufficient to
generate multiple selective regimes. Shifts from one regime to
another(i.e.hypo-toamphistomyorviceversa)appearstobepri-
marilydrivenbygrowthform,suggestingthat thefitnessbenefit
of amphistomy—faster diffusion of CO2 to chloroplasts—is
greatest in species with ‘fast’ life histories.
(a) Multimodality implies constraint on the
macroevolutionary adaptive landscape
Multimodality (figure 1) cannot be explained by an evolutionary
process
model
neglecting
constraint.
However,
apparent
clustering could occur by systematic underrepresentation of
intermediate trait values [42] or non-random taxon sampling. It
ishighlyimprobablethatthedataarebiasedagainstintermediate
phenotypes because the studies used in the dataset generally
have no a priori hypothesis about SR in their focal species.
Any bias is likely in the opposite direction because I omitted
many studies that report only qualitative data, which is most
probablewhenspeciesarecompletelyhypo-oramphistomatous.
Non-random taxon sampling could also give the appearance of
multimodality. To give an extreme example, if there had been a
single transition from hypo- to amphistomy followed by stasis,
then sampling the tips of the phylogeny would produce a multi-
modal pattern with apparently strong statistical support, even
though it only represents a single evolutionary event. The fact
that multimodality reappears in multiple distantly related
families (figure 2) makes non-random taxon sampling alone an
unlikely explanation, though it might accentuate the pattern.
Future work is needed to extend regime-inference methods
[33,43,44] to non-Gaussian traits, as this study begins to do
with a new evolutionary process model for proportion traits.
(b) Selection is the most probable explanation for
phenotypic constraint
In principle, constraint could reflect a mix of selective, gen-
etic, developmental and functional factors [9]. However,
there is little evidence for non-selective constraints on SR,
whereas selection explains the precise position of modes in
the trait distribution and the association with growth form.
Although the molecular mechanisms have not been ident-
ified, plants exhibit the ability to fine-tune SR through
independent control of upper and lower stomatal densities:
loci capable of generating intermediate SR phenotypes
occur spontaneously during mutagenesis [45], segregate
among natural populations [24,46,47] and are fixed between
closely related species [25,48]. That such intermediate pheno-
types are rare in nature implicates selective constraint.
However, I cannot rule out that a tight link between epidermal
cell fate and ab-adaxial polarity established early in leaf devel-
opment could reinforce the preponderance of hypostomy.
Even if hypostomy was initially favoured by selection, epi-
dermes with (without) stomata could become tightly linked
to abaxial (adaxial) identity over time. If this developmental
constraint were important, then transitions from hypo- to
amphistomy should be rare. Future studies with dense taxo-
nomic sampling and well-resolved phylogenies should be
able to test this prediction.
In contrast to non-selective forces, the cost–benefit model
shows that with a small number of realistic, evidence-based
assumptions, selection is sufficient to accommodate the data.
First, selection predicts not only multimodality, but the
location of the dominant modes near 0 and 0.5, a pattern that
is hard to reconcile with non-selective constraints. Stomata
are often distributed equally on both surfaces (amphistomy),
because this arrangement maximizes photosynthetic rate
even in leaves with a highly differentiated palisade and
spongy mesophyll [13,15,49]. More often, all stomata are on
the lower surface because the costs of upper stomata outweigh
the benefits. A dearth of intermediates between hypo- and
amphistomy occurs when these phenotypes often fall in a fit-
ness valley or intermediate environments are rare. However,
the best mixture model includes a small peak of intermediates
(electronic supplementary material, table S1; figure 1d),
suggesting that some environments support a broader array
of adaptive optima. However, the fact that most species,
especially within families (figure 2), cluster around particular
modes suggests constraint around a narrow range of optima.

Figure 4. Association between amphistomy and fast growth forms points to selection on life-history shaping SR evolution. The violin plot shows SR as a function of
growth form. The width of the grey polygons indicates the density of data. Length of grey polygon indicates the range of the data; the point indicates the median;

(c) Life history, more than anatomy and climate,
determines stomatal ratio
Selection also best explains non-random association between
SR, growth form and climate. In particular, growth form is
strongly associated with SR (figure 4), as suggested by earlier
ecological surveys [17,30]. Two hypotheses that might explain
this relationship are: (i) herbaceous plants have shorter leaf
lifespans [50], requiring higher photosynthetic rates to pay
their construction costs in a shorter time [51]; and (ii) herbac-
eous plants have faster life histories, leading to stronger
selection on high growth rates, mediated in part by higher
leaf-level photosynthetic rate [52]. That the relationship
between SR and whole-plant lifespan holds within herbaceous
(annuals versus perennials) species, supports the second
hypothesis (selection on faster life history favours amphist-
omy). If correct, this hypothesis implies remarkably strong
selection on leaf-level photosynthesis, especially the rate of
leaf CO2 diffusion, in herbs. Stomatal conductance, which is
determined by stomatal aperture and density, is one major
component of total leaf CO2 conductance, which also includes
internal factors affected by leaf anatomy [53]. For hypostoma-
tous leaves, increasing SR can increase total leaf diffusive
conductance more than adding stomata to the lower surface,
as long as there is some internal resistance to CO2 [16].
Hence,
selection
for
increased
photosynthesis
in
herbs
should select for some combination of increased stomatal
size/density and ratio.
Surprisingly, there was little evidence supporting the
most common adaptive explanation for amphistomy that
thicker leaves select for stomata on both sides to facilitate
CO2 diffusion [13]. In actuality, support for this hypothesis
is mixed (electronic supplementary material, appendix S1),
because the trend is weak (electronic supplementary material,
figure S1a). Less powerful studies could easily have failed to
detect a significant relationship. I also found that amphist-
omy, perhaps counterintuitively, was more common in
plants from low precipitation environments (electronic sup-
plementary material, figure S1b), as predicted (electronic
supplementary material, appendix S1). Although low precipi-
tation was correlated with leaf area index (a proxy for habitat
openness), multiple phylogenetic regression indicated that
precipitation was causal, in contrast to previous studies
[20,23].
This
is
especially
surprising
given
association
between SR and fast growth form. CO2 limits photosynthesis
most under the high light of an open canopy, implying
that fast growth, high light and amphistomy should co-
occur, but there was no evidence for this association. The
discrepancy
between
studies
could
reflect
different
methods—plant-level descriptions of light environment (pre-
vious studies) versus coarser, remotely sensed measurements
of canopy cover (this study)—or that previous patterns were
restricted to particular families. I was unable to test the effects
of leaf orientation and stomatal packing on SR, although
these are likely to be important factors [22,54]. The evidence
from this and previous studies shows that SR is an ecologi-
cally relevant functional trait that could be valuable in
physiological ecological and evolution [55].
That many ecologically important traits, like SR, cluster
around particular values but not others suggests pervasive
constraint on phenotypic evolution. The emerging evidence
from this and other recent studies on SR (see especially [24])
is that peaks of high fitness are constrained by a trade-off
between photosynthetic rate and defence against foliar patho-
gens that preferentially infect through upper stomata. In
particular, the cost–benefit model analysed here predicts that
even a small change in the fitness costs or benefits are sufficient
to shift trait evolution into qualitatively different selective
regimes. If it is generally true that multimodal traits are associ-
ated with rapid regime shifts, then one way forward is to look
for signatures of such shifts in closely related species that sit
astride different regimes. For example, Muir et al. [25] recently
identified two large effect loci that together account for the
phenotypic difference between hypostomatous and amphisto-
matous species, perhaps suggesting that these loci enabled a
regime shift. Integrating comparative biology, mechanistic
studies of organismal function and the genetics of adaptation
points to a general approach for evaluating the common fea-
tures of macroevolutionary adaptive landscapes and, hence,
the role of selection in constraining phenotypic evolution.
