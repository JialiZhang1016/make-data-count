Climate change is increasing the frequency and magnitude of tem-
perature anomalies that cause coral bleaching, leading to wide-
spread mortality of stony corals that can fundamentally alter reef
structure and function. However, bleaching often is spatially var-
iable for a given heat stress event, and drivers of this hetero-
geneity are not well resolved. While small-scale experiments
have shown that excess nitrogen can increase the susceptibility of
a coral colony to bleaching, we lack evidence that heterogeneity
in nitrogen pollution can shape spatial patterns of coral bleaching
across a seascape. Using island-wide surveys of coral bleaching
and nitrogen availability within a Bayesian hierarchical modeling
framework, we tested the hypothesis that excess nitrogen inter-
acts with temperature anomalies to alter coral bleaching for the
two dominant genera of branching corals in Moorea, French
Polynesia. For both coral genera, Pocillopora and Acropora, heat
stress primarily drove bleaching prevalence (i.e., the proportion
of colonies on a reef that bleached). In contrast, the severity of
bleaching (i.e., the proportion of an individual colony that bleached)
was positively associated with both heat stress and nitrogen avail-
ability for both genera. Importantly, nitrogen interacted with heat
stress to increase bleaching severity up to twofold when nitrogen
was high and heat stress was relatively low. Our finding that excess
nitrogen can trigger severe bleaching even under relatively low heat
stress implies that mitigating nutrient pollution may enhance the
resilience of coral communities in the face of mounting stresses from
global climate change.

C
limate change is driving an increase in marine heat waves
that are killing foundation species worldwide (1). On coral
reefs, thermal anomalies associated with rising water tempera-
tures cause coral bleaching, the breakdown of the mutualism
between corals and their endosymbiotic algae, Symbiodiniaceae
(2–4). Large heat stress events and the resulting coral bleaching
can cause widespread coral mortality and alter coral community
composition (5–7), as well as affect the diversity and abundance
of associated fishes (8, 9). Repeated bleaching events threaten
the persistence of coral reefs and the ecosystem goods and ser-
vices they provide (10). As the frequency and intensity of coral
bleaching events increase (6, 11), it is crucial to better un-
derstand what factors, in addition to temperature, influence the
propensity of a coral colony to bleach (12, 13). One such putative
stressor to the mutualism between corals and their endosymbiotic
algae is excess nitrogen.
Nutrient pollution has increased to such an extent over the last
century that anthropogenically derived nutrients now dwarf
natural nutrient sources (14, 15). These nutrients are dramati-
cally altering coastal marine systems, particularly oligotrophic
systems such as coral reefs. Excess anthropogenic nutrients, in
the form of both nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P), can nega-
tively impact coral reproduction, growth, and survivorship (16,
17); intensify coral diseases (18, 19); and exacerbate the adverse
effects of ocean acidification on reef calcification rates (20).
With respect to coral bleaching, small-scale in situ enrichment
experiments have revealed that anthropogenic forms of N can
increase the probability that a coral colony will bleach and sub-
sequently die (21). Current hypotheses suggest that increased N
availability makes corals more susceptible to bleaching via a
variety of physiological mechanisms (16, 22), which is supported
by both laboratory and field experiments (19, 21, 23–25).
It is unclear how findings from small-scale experiments ex-
amining the effect of excess N on the mutualism between coral
and Symbiodiniaceae translate into real-world conditions over
broad spatial scales. Results to date have been mixed. Previous
studies from the Caribbean and Great Barrier Reef revealed
positive correlations between water-column nutrient concentra-
tions and coral bleaching across large reef tracts (26, 27), while
others showed negative correlations between water quality and
coral bleaching (28). However, data on N and bleaching in these
studies are often collected at different spatial and/or temporal
resolutions, across gradients of other abiotic factors, and across
coral communities that vary in assemblage structure and species
diversity, making it difficult to interpret unambiguously the re-
lationships between N availability and coral bleaching.
To better understand the influence of excess N on coral
bleaching in situ at a broad spatial scale, we quantified spatial
patterns of N for the entire ∼50-km2 lagoon reef system that
Significance
Corals are disappearing worldwide due to both local and
global stressors. Yet, our understanding of the interaction
among these two types of stressors is limited, hindering efforts
to conserve coral reefs. With a large dataset at a seascape scale
across Moorea, French Polynesia, we showed that coral
bleaching was more severe as both heat stress and nitrogen
pollution increased. We also found that corals bleached more
severely at comparatively low heat stress if they lived where
nitrogen pollution was high. Thus, given that nitrogen pollu-
tion worsens the severity of coral bleaching, even during mild
heat stress events, there is a critical need to address both local
and global threats to coral reefs.

encircles the island of Moorea, French Polynesia. This was done
during a moderate heat stress event in 2016, when we also
quantified bleaching metrics for >10,000 coral colonies of the
two common genera of branching corals (Pocillopora, Acropora)
at 167 sites distributed across the lagoon (<3 m water depth)
around the island. Contemporaneous estimates of heat stress for
these sites were generated from continuous records of in situ
water temperature. Analyses of these data revealed marked ef-
fects of N availability on coral bleaching across the seascape, as
well as evidence that N alters the relationship between heat
stress and bleaching. Our results suggest that local pollution can
have an important impact on climate-driven disruption of coral
reef ecosystems.
Results
Trends in Temperature and N Availability. During 2016, maximum
water temperature in the lagoons of Moorea peaked in early
April at 30.0 °C and exceeded the maximum monthly mean
(MMM) of 29 °C, a noted threshold for heat stress for corals in
Moorea (29), for 70 straight days from early February through
mid-April (Fig. 1A). Patterns of heat stress, defined as a 12-wk
running sum of all mean weekly temperatures exceeding the
MMM, were variable around the island, with heat stress occur-
ring from as early as January to as late as mid-March, depending
on the site (Fig. 1B). Heat stress was highest on the west side of
Moorea (Long Term Ecological Research [LTER] sites 5 and 6,
Fig. 2) with peaks of ∼5 °C weeks of cumulative heat stress. N
availability, measured using the nitrogen concentration (%N) in
the tissue of a ubiquitous alga Turbinaria ornata, was generally
higher closer to shore, but this pattern varied spatially, with
hotspots occurring near large bays and steep watersheds (Fig.
2). In general, the north shore had the highest N availability on
average, except for the northwest portion of the island that had
consistently low nitrogen levels. Nitrogen availability (%N) was
positively correlated with δN15 (ρ = 0.62, P < 0.01), which is often
used as an indicator of anthropogenic nutrient sources (SI Ap-
pendix, Fig. S1). We also explored potential covariation between
heat stress and N availability and found no apparent pattern (SI
Appendix, Figs. S2 and S3).
Spatial Patterns of Coral Bleaching. Across 167 sites around
Moorea (Fig. 2), we observed Pocillopora and Acropora at 149
sites. We surveyed a total of 1,500 Acropora colonies and 8,730
Pocillopora colonies, ranging from 1 to 247 colonies per site.
Overall, 37% of Acropora and 28% of Pocillopora colonies
exhibited bleaching. Spatial patterns of bleaching prevalence
(the probability of bleaching across colonies) and severity (the
amount of bleaching per colony) were variable across genera
(Fig. 3). For Acropora, bleaching prevalence was high along both
the north and west shores, where up to 100% of colonies at each
site were bleached (Fig. 3A). Bleaching in Pocillopora was most
prevalent across the north shore (Fig. 3B), with bleaching
roughly twice as prevalent on the north shore as elsewhere (47%
of colonies exhibiting bleaching on the north shore vs. ∼22% of
colonies elsewhere). When bleaching was observed for Acropora,
severity was generally high, with the median percent of colony
bleached being 55% regardless of location (Fig. 3C). Severity of
bleaching in Pocillopora tended to mirror patterns in prevalence,
with a median of 55% of a colony bleached along the north
shore, compared to 37 to 41% elsewhere (Fig. 3D).
Predictors of Coral Bleaching. We found generally consistent re-
sults across genera and bleaching metrics for colony- and site-
level predictors (Fig. 4). Coral colony size was positively related
to bleaching prevalence in Pocillopora, but not Acropora, and
negatively related to severity in both Pocillopora and Acropora,
with larger colonies tending to bleach less severely. There was
little evidence for an effect of depth, except for a small positive
relationship between depth and bleaching prevalence in Pocillopora
(Fig. 4B). Thus, colonies in deeper water bleached slightly more,
although the depth range of our observations was small (≤3 m). In
general, bleaching prevalence and severity were higher for corals
at back reef sites compared to fringing reef sites (SI Appendix,
Table S1).
Nitrogen and cumulative heat stress were each positively re-
lated with bleaching severity for both Pocillopora and Acropora,
as well as with bleaching prevalence in Pocillopora (Fig. 4).
Bleaching prevalence in Acropora also increased with increasing
heat stress, and there was some model support that N decreased

the propensity of Acropora to bleach (Fig. 4A). Thus, for both
genera, N and heat stress independently affected the proportion of
corals on a reef that showed any degree of bleaching (prevalence,
Fig. 4B). In contrast, N and heat stress interacted to influence how
much an affected coral colony bleached (severity, Figs. 4A and 5
and SI Appendix, Fig. S4). While Acropora showed higher levels of
bleaching severity than did Pocillopora (Fig. 5), both genera dis-
played the same pattern of change in the relationship between N
and bleaching severity as a function of heat stress (Fig. 5).
The interaction between N and cumulative heat stress in
shaping the severity of bleaching was negative (Figs. 4 and 5).
Increasing N generally led to increasing bleaching severity, but
the level of heat stress mediated the sensitivity of corals to var-
iation in nitrogen (i.e., slope of the relationship) (Fig. 5). Sen-
sitivity to N was greatest when heat stress was low, and it
declined as heat stress increased (Fig. 5). Both coral genera were
relatively unaffected by variation in N at the highest observed
heat stress, a situation where the majority of an affected colony
bleached regardless of N enrichment (Fig. 5). Notably, for each
coral genus, the severity of bleaching that occurred under low
heat stress at high N was similar to the most severe bleaching
that occurred at the highest level of heat stress (Fig. 5).
Discussion
We show that nitrogen enrichment can interact with heat stress
to influence coral bleaching across the seascape. Based on a
dataset of >10,000 corals that were sampled around the island of
Moorea during a moderate heat stress event, we found that both
heat stress and N enrichment impacted spatial heterogeneity in
bleaching prevalence and severity. We found a significant in-
teraction between heat stress and N enrichment on the severity
of coral bleaching. In areas with relatively low heat stress, high
levels of N increased the severity of bleaching up to twofold. In
contrast, at the highest levels of heat stress, coral bleaching was
severe regardless of the level of N. Importantly, high N pollution
at low heat stress resulted in corals bleaching as severely as corals
at high heat stress. Heat-induced coral bleaching is a major
driver of coral mortality on reefs worldwide. Yet, how local
factors impact coral responses to heat stress is poorly understood
at seascape scales. The results of this study provide critical evi-
dence that locally generated nitrogen pollution can exacerbate
the extent of climate-driven coral bleaching events.
Interaction between Nitrogen and Heat Stress. Excess nitrogen may
facilitate coral bleaching by compromising the relationship be-
tween the coral host and the Symbiodiniaceae symbionts via
several nonexclusive mechanisms. For example, increased N
availability may lead to an imbalance between N and P that
damages coral photosystems (22); may decrease the amount of
carbon that symbionts return to corals, leading to starvation (30);
and may increase the production of N-based free radicals (31).
Nitrogen pollution can lead to greater susceptibility of corals to
heat stress by increasing algal growth rates, leading to increased
competition between algae and corals (32). Our results reinforce
patterns from previous small-scale experiments to show that in-
creased N availability can promote coral bleaching at the reef-wide
scale. Further, our work is consistent with laboratory (24) and field
experiments (19, 21, 25), as well as large-scale surveys (26, 27) and
time series (33) showing that increased N availability facilitates
coral bleaching.
Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the level of
heat stress may mediate the impacts of excess N on coral
bleaching, with high heat stress overwhelming any effect of ex-
cess N. We found significant heterogeneity in heat stress across
the seascape that interacted negatively with N availability to in-
fluence the severity of coral bleaching. In areas with low heat
stress, N increased the severity of bleaching in the two dominant
genera of branching corals in Moorea (Pocillopora, Acropora),
approximately doubling the mean proportion of a colony that
bleached (Fig. 5). The influence of N on bleaching severity di-
minished with increasing heat stress such that at the greatest
observed level of heat stress, the mean proportion of a coral
colony that bleached was high across all levels of N.
We also found that nitrogen influenced the proportion of
corals on a reef that showed any level of bleaching (prevalence),
but the patterns were less certain and more nuanced. In our
surveys, the proportion of a coral that bleached ranged from very
minor (e.g., a few branch tips) to the entire colony. For both
coral genera, we found no compelling evidence that N and heat
stress interacted to influence bleaching prevalence. Thus, the
effects of these factors were additive, at least over the range of
heat stress that occurred in the moderate thermal event of 2016.
Interestingly, the effect of N on bleaching prevalence appeared to
differ qualitatively between the two coral genera. For Pocillopora,
N increased both the probability a colony would suffer at least
some bleaching and the severity of that bleaching. For Acropora,
our evidence suggests that N tended to reduce the likelihood a
coral would bleach, but increased the severity for any colony that
did bleach. Because mortality of a bleached coral is directly related
to the proportion of its endosymbiont (Symbiodiniaceae) pop-
ulation that is lost (34), the ecologically most important effect of N
enrichment in our study was the increase in bleaching severity
under low heat stress. Our finding that elevated N can cause severe
bleaching under low heat stress implies that N pollution may in-
duce mass mortality of corals even when typical thermal tolerances
have not been crossed.
The negative interaction between N and heat stress on
bleaching severity that we observed also helps explain and rec-
oncile previously reported findings. Our result—that excess N
lowered the threshold for severe coral bleaching at low but not
high levels of heat stress—is consistent with other observational
studies and mechanistic experiments. On the Great Barrier Reef,
concentrations of inorganic N in the water column were posi-
tively correlated with coral bleaching prevalence in years with
moderate heat stress (27), but were uncorrelated with bleaching
during the strong thermal event associated with 2015/2016 El
Niño when bleaching and mortality were extreme (35). Similarly,

in a field experiment in Moorea, excess N increased bleaching
prevalence in both Pocillopora and Acropora, but the effect of N
on bleaching was stronger at lower levels of heat stress (21).
Seascape-Scale Effects across Habitats and Taxa. Coral bleaching
stems from multiple mechanisms operating at a variety of spatial
and temporal scales (36, 37), where finer-scale processes are
constrained by processes at higher levels [i.e., hierarchy theory
(38)]. For example, within a coral colony, bleaching can be var-
iable, and likewise two colonies side by side can exhibit vastly
different bleaching responses (39). Given the role of different
drivers at multiple scales, uncovering emergent effects across the
seascape can be difficult. Despite this challenge, our study
revealed strong relationships between N and bleaching (Fig. 4),
helping to explain spatial patchiness in bleaching across the
seascape at an island scale. To uncover these effects, we 1) ex-
plicitly accounted for scale using a hierarchical model that con-
sidered variation across colonies within sites and variation across
sites within habitats and coastlines; 2) observed bleaching for two
genera, allowing us to infer patterns across taxa that are some-
what different in their susceptibility to excess N and heat stress;
and 3) collected data on drivers of bleaching at scales meaningful
to the hypothesized effect on bleaching. Future studies can benefit
by considering explicitly how multiple drivers are operating at
multiple scales to explain patchiness in coral bleaching at a
seascape scale.
Fringing reefs in Moorea, which often experience increased
runoff and sedimentation that increase turbidity, had lower levels
of bleaching prevalence and severity than did back reefs (SI
Appendix, Table S1). Several mechanisms may account for this
finding. Turbidity, which is often higher on fringing reefs, can
potentially moderate effects of heat stress on coral bleaching by re-
ducing light and lowering photooxidative stress (34). The long-term
decline in coral cover on many of the fringing reefs in Moorea (40)
may have also contributed to lower bleaching on fringing reefs be-
cause corals that persist in inherently stressful habitats may be more
robust to heat stress due to selection and acclimatization. For ex-
ample, corals surviving on the fringing reefs may be dominated by
thermotolerant endosymbiont communities (41, 42), microbiomes
that are resistant to the effects of nutrient pollution (25, 32), and/or
exhibit adaptive traits such as greater energy reserves (43) or shifting
endosymbiont communities (44).
The effects of N and heat stress on bleaching differed some-
what between the taxa we studied, with Acropora being more
sensitive to severe bleaching than Pocillopora. Taxonomic vari-
ability of coral bleaching is well known (5), and our results are
consistent with patterns previously observed on Moorea and
elsewhere, with Acropora often being the most susceptible genus,
followed by Pocillopora (29, 45). More recent experimental work

revealed that excess N consistently increased bleaching preva-
lence in Pocillopora while bleaching in Acropora was more tightly
linked to heat stress (21). Our results are consistent with these
observations but also indicate that both taxa responded similarly
to spatial heterogeneity in N availability by experiencing more
severe bleaching under N-enriched conditions (Fig. 5). Thus, N
pollution increases the severity of coral bleaching of multiple
taxa with different underlying sensitivities to thermal stress.
Anthropogenic Influences on Coral Bleaching. Different sources of
nitrogen (e.g., nitrate, ammonium, or urea) often impact coral
physiology differently. For example, anthropogenically derived N
(nitrate) is more likely to impair coral physiology and growth
than is naturally derived N (urea or ammonium) (17, 30). Fur-
ther, in a recent field experiment, nitrate increased bleaching
prevalence and duration in Pocillopora corals while urea did not
affect bleaching (21). Our data suggest that the impact of N
availability across the seascape was likely due to an increase in
anthropogenically derived N. We found that the total N in algal
tissue was positively correlated with δN15 (SI Appendix, Fig. S1).
Higher levels of δN15 in algae are often indicative of N derived
from human sources, suggesting that sites with higher N and
δN15 had higher input from anthropogenic N sources (46, 47).
We could not distinguish between the independent effects of
total N and δN15 on bleaching because they were highly correlated
among our sites. Yet, our data suggest that increases in anthro-
pogenic N drove increases in the prevalence and severity of coral
bleaching.
The observation that excess N can exacerbate coral bleaching
is of great importance for the immediate future of coral reefs.
Continued changes in land use and altered precipitation regimes
from climate change will likely result in more runoff and an-
thropogenic nutrients from terrestrial systems reaching coastal
marine systems (48). Further, climate change is expected to in-
crease the frequency and severity of temperature anomalies,
leading to more severe and widespread coral bleaching (6, 11).
The combination of excess anthropogenic N with an increase in
the duration of both low and high levels of heat stress suggests
that corals will bleach more frequently and for longer periods in
the near future. By lowering the temperature threshold for se-
vere coral bleaching, excess N has the potential to decrease the
return time between bleaching events, leaving corals with less
time to recover following even relatively mild heat stress events.
Together, our results suggest that although the ultimate survival
of coral reefs is dependent on the immediate reduction of carbon
emissions that cause global warming, management of land use
and near-shore water quality are critically important for the
resistance and resilience of corals to near-term increases in
heat stress.

Methods
Study Site. Moorea, French Polynesia is a volcanic high island with an ∼60-km
perimeter in the central South Pacific ∼20 km west of Tahiti (17°30′S,
149°50′W). A barrier reef surrounds the island and forms lagoons ranging
from 0.8 to 1.3 km in width. Shoreward of the reef crest is a distinct back
reef habitat that is less than ∼3 m deep and is composed of a mosaic of coral
patch reefs, coral rubble, and sand. Fringing reefs ring the lagoon at the
edge of the island. Our study was conducted on the back reef and fringing
reefs from January to May 2016 during a sea surface temperature anomaly
when water temperatures were elevated to levels predicted to cause coral
bleaching (Fig. 1).
Coral Bleaching Surveys. We surveyed 167 sites around Moorea and recorded
bleaching on colonies of Pocillopora and Acropora, which were present at
149 of the sites. Sites were a minimum of 0.5 km apart, and at each site two
snorkelers conducted 10-min swims in opposite directions recording all ob-
served colonies of Pocillopora and Acropora. Sites were distributed around
the entire island and were categorized by habitat (fringing reef and back
reef) and by the dominant cardinal direction of the coastline (north, east,
west) (Fig. 2).
We surveyed the two most common and widespread genera of branching
corals in the system, Acropora and Pocillopora. The most common Acropora
species included Acropora hyacinthus, Acropora retusa, and Acropora lutkeni,
while the most common Pocillopora species were Pocillopora verrucosa,
Pocillopora meandrina, and Pocillopora eydouxi. Pocillopora damicornis and
Acropora pulchra were present at some sites but were not included in the
surveys since they were largely restricted to the fringing reef sites.
For each colony, we estimated the water depth (from 0 to 3 m deep) and
its size class (size classes were 1 to 10 cm, 11 to 20 cm, 21 to 30 cm, 31 to
40 cm, and >40 cm diameter). We then recorded whether bleaching was
present (prevalence) and, if so, estimated the percentage of the colony
surface area that was bleached (severity). Because corals undergo natural,
seasonal variation in Symbiodiniaceae density that can affect their color-
ation (49), we defined bleached tissue only as tissue that had lost all
pigmentation.
Seawater Temperature and Nitrogen Availability. In situ seawater temperature
was recorded with loggers (64M SeaBird Water Temperature Recorder;
Sea-Bird Electronics, Inc.) at 1 to 2 m depth at four back reef and six
fringing reef sites distributed around the island (Fig. 1) (50). Tempera-
ture was attributed to each sampling site location based on its proximity
to one of the temperature loggers within each habitat (Fig. 2). From
these temperature records we calculated cumulative heat stress (in °C
weeks) as a 12-wk running sum for all temperatures exceeding the
MMM temperatures from February to April of 29 °C, based on an earlier
study (29) that showed this metric was a good predictor of bleaching
in Moorea.
To assess nitrogen availability at each site, we measured the N content
(%N) in the long-lived brown macroalga Turbinaria ornata at each site.
The nutrient content of macroalgae is often used as a proxy for ambient
nutrient conditions as these macroalgae integrate nutrients over a
relatively long time frame (i.e., weeks to months) (51). Both field sur-
veys and experiments show that algae in consistently enriched envi-
ronments typically have higher tissue nutrients (19, 52). During January
and May 2016, we sampled 10 individual thalli of T. ornata at each site
around the island for analysis of N content while we also surveyed coral
bleaching (there was minimal bleaching in January 2016). Samples were im-
mediately placed on ice and transported to the laboratory. One blade from
each thallus was sampled at 5 cm below the apical tip of the thallus. These
blades were scrubbed of epiphytes and briefly rinsed with fresh water before
being dried at 60 °C to a constant weight and ground to powder. Total N
content was determined via elemental analysis using a CHN Carlo-Erba ele-
mental analyzer (NA1500) CN Analyzer at the University of Georgia, Center for
Applied Isotope Studies. We also measured δN15 in the tissues of T. ornata at
the Marine Science Institute Analytical Laboratory at the University of Cal-
ifornia, Santa Barbara, using standard elemental analyzer isotope ratio mass
spectrometer (EA-IRMS) procedures. We averaged values from January and
May for analyses to represent nutrient conditions throughout the Austral
summer.
Bayesian Hierarchical Model. We modeled bleaching prevalence and severity
with Bayesian hierarchical models where prevalence was modeled as
yp
i ∼Bernoulliðμp
jkhcÞ, and severity was modeled as ys
i ∼Betaðr × μs
jkhc, r × ð1 −μs
jkhcÞÞ.
Hierarchical effects of site, habitat, and coastline were included for the mean
of both components; predictors were included at the scale at which they were
measured; and coefficients for each predictor were estimated separately for
prevalence (p) and severity (s) at each level,

where j represents colonies, k represents sites, h represents habitat, and
c represents coastlines. Predictors were transformed to a zero mean and
unit variance to improve convergence and allow for comparisons across
effects, and interactions were calculated with transformed predictors to
alleviate potential collinearity between the interaction and the main
effects. Priors for all regression coefficients and for α were ∼Nð0,100Þ,
priors for variances were ∼Uð0,50Þ, and the prior for r was ∼Gammað0.1, 0.1Þ.
Models were fitted with JAGS using the rjags package in R (53). Each model
was run with 10,000 iterations and three chains. Model convergence was
assessed with Gelman–Rubin statistics (54), and model fits were assessed
with posterior predictive checks and Bayesian R2 (SI Appendix, Tables S2
and S3).
We considered evidence for a predictor to be influential in explaining the
response variable when the 80% credible interval did not cross zero.
Data and Code Availability. All analyses were performed in the R language for
statistical computing version 3.4 (55). Temperature data can be accessed at
ref. 50, nutrient and bleaching data are available at ref. 56, and all R
scripts used to perform analyses and prepare figures can be accessed at
