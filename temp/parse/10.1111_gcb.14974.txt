1 | INTRODUCTION
The world population is projected to reach an estimated 9–10 billion 
by 2050, increasing global food demand by 70%–100% (Alexandratos 
& Bruinsma, 2012; Baulcombe et al., 2009; De Silva & Soto, 2009; 
Kapetsky, Aguilar-Manjarrez, & Jenness, 2013). Meeting the global 
food demand—and doing so in a way that limits environ­mental 
­damage—is a fundamental challenge to sustainable development 
(UN, 2019). Between 2011 and 2015, marine capture fisheries and 
mariculture (both marine and brackish water aquaculture) produced 
an average 105.5 million tonnes of seafood annually (FAO, 2018). For 
approximately 3.2 billion people in the world, seafood contribute,

Abstract
Previous studies have focused on changes in the geographical distribution of terrestrial 
biomes and species targeted by marine capture fisheries due to climate change impacts. 
Given mariculture's substantial contribution to global seafood production and its grow-
ing significance in recent decades, it is essential to evaluate the effects of climate change 
on mariculture and their socio-economic consequences. Here, we projected climate 
change impacts on the marine aquaculture diversity for 85 of the currently most com-
monly farmed fish and invertebrate species in the world's coastal and/or open ocean 
areas. Results of ensemble projections from three Earth system models and three spe-
cies distribution models show that climate change may lead to a substantial redistribu-
tion of mariculture species richness potential, with an average of 10%–40% decline in 
the number of species being potentially suitable to be farmed in tropical to subtropical 
regions. In contrast, mariculture species richness potential is projected to increase by 
about 40% at higher latitudes under the ‘no mitigation policy’ scenario (RCP 8.5) by the 
mid-21st century. In Exclusive Economic Zones where mariculture is currently under-
taken, we projected an average future decline of 1.3% and 5% in mariculture species 
richness potential under RCP 2.6 (‘strong mitigation’) and RCP 8.5 scenarios, respec-
tively, by the 2050s relative to the 2000s. Our findings highlight the opportunities and 
challenges for climate adaptation in the mariculture sector through the redistribution 
of farmed species and expansion of mariculture locations. Our results can help inform  
adaptation planning and governance mechanisms to minimize local environmental  
impacts and potential conflicts with other marine and coastal sectors in the future.

about 20% of their protein intake (FAO, 2018). Compared to ani-
mal production on land, seafood is generally considered to have a 
lower environmental impact (Hilborn, Banobi, Hall, Pucylowski, & 
Walsworth, 2018)—yet the role of seafood in achieving the sustain-
able development goals remains under-recognized and undervalued 
(HLPE, 2014). As a food high in protein and low in trans-unsaturated 
fatty acids, seafood provides a range of positive health benefits. 
Seafood consumption is recommended in most dietary guidelines 
(Meyer et  al., 2003) mainly because finfish and shellfish are an 
essential source of highly bioavailable vitamins, minerals and omega-3 
(n-3) and omega-6 (n-6) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs; Larsen, 
Eilertsen, & Elvevoll, 2011; Tocher, 2015). The latter is important 
notably for cardiovascular health, cognitive function and prenatal 
and postnatal brain development (Giles, Mahoney, & Kanarek, 2019; 
Harris, Miller, Tighe, Davidson, & Schaefer, 2008; Innis, 2008).
Aquaculture has played an essential role in filling the gap between 
food fish (finfish, crustaceans, molluscs and other aquatic animals, but 
excluding seaweeds and products not for human consumption) de-
mand and supply from capture fisheries. Global production of food 
fish from aquaculture (freshwater, marine and brackish) has increased 
from 2.6 million in 1970 to nearly half of the 171 million tonnes of 
food fish (excluding aquatic plants) consumed worldwide in 2016 
(FAO, 2018); with Asia continuing to dominate the sector and ac-
counting for more than 92% of global aquaculture production (Phillips 
& Pérez-Ramírez, 2017). The contribution of mariculture (including 
brackish production) share in total aquaculture has increased mark-
edly from 14% in 2000 to 37% in 2016 (FAO, 2018). Mariculture is a 
form of aquaculture where ‘cultivation of the end product takes place 
in seawater, such as fjords, inshore and open waters, and inland seas 
or inland facilities (Recirculating Aquaculture System, RAS) in which 
the salinity exceeds 20 PSU’ (FAO, 2004). The Sea Around Us maricul-
ture database (www.searo​undus.org) estimated an increase in mari-
culture production from 5 million tonnes in 1990 to 21 million tonnes 
in 2010. This increased production is primarily driven by the growing 
demand for seafood in developed countries (Campbell & Pauly, 2013; 
FAO, 2014), which focuses on high value omnivorous and carnivorous 
species (FAO, 2014). Although projections of the future contribu-
tion of aquaculture—including mariculture—to food supply is uncer-
tain, it has been estimated that if all inputs were available, the sector 
could provide 16–47 million additional tonnes of fish by 2030 (Hall, 
Delaporte, Phillips, Beveridge, & O′Keefe., M., 2011). While aquacul-
ture may increase food provision, it is important to note that recent 
work shows that from a nutritional perspective, species from capture 
fisheries, may provide a greater contribution to micronutrient intakes 
than common aquaculture species (Bogard et al., 2015).
Yet, climate change could reduce the anticipated potential sea-
food supply from mariculture. Sea level rise, increases in water 
temperature, ocean acidity, storm frequencies and wave action, as 
well as changes in salinity, among others, are expected to impact 
the suitability of marine habitats (coastal waters and open ocean) 
to farm seafood (Barange & Perry, 2009; Cheung et  al., 2009; 
Gattuso et al., 2015; Harley et al., 2006). Increases in temperature 
and acidity, in particular, are also expected to directly affect the 
physiology and ecology of farmed species (Cochrane, Young, Soto, 
& Bahri, 2009) by altering growth rates, disease susceptibility, sur-
vival rates, reproduction and shell quality in the case of bivalves 
(Handisyde, Ross, Badjeck, & Allison, 2006). Such environmental 
changes might lead to a reduction in areas suitable for mariculture 
and redistribution of farmed species from their historical farming 
range—particularly for species that are farmed using open or semi-
open production systems, including salmon. Thus, climate change 
is expected to affect the quantity and quality of seafood pro-
duction from mariculture. Two studies have estimated the areas 
currently not utilized, but potentially suitable for mariculture, 
which could increase seafood production to contribute to and im-
prove food security in the future (Gentry et  al., 2017; Oyinlola, 
Reygondeau, Wabnitz, Troell, & Cheung, 2018). However, these 
areas are likely to be impacted by climate change, thereby reduc-
ing the chances of mariculture expansion and associated projected 
production of seafood in the future.
Recent studies that investigated climate change effects on 
the growth potential and availability of suitable marine areas for 
mariculture (Froehlich, Gentry, & Halpern, 2018; Klinger, Levin, & 
Watson, 2017) suggest that climate change impact will be hetero-
geneous across species and regions. Noticeable adverse effects are 
projected for mariculture-suitable marine areas around the equa-
tor with substantial gains towards the poles. Selective breeding 
(Klinger et al., 2017), risk-based zoning and siting (Barange et al., 
2018; Froehlich et al., 2018) and changes to alternative farm spe-
cies with favourable growth rates and market acceptability (Harvey, 
Soto, Carolsfeld, Beveridge, & Bartley, 2016) have been suggested 
as potential adaptation strategies that could be important to in-
crease seafood production from mariculture under climate change.
To date, climate change impacts on mariculture species richness 
or diversity remains poorly understood (Oyinlola et al., 2018). Here, 
mariculture species richness potential (MSRP) represents the total 
number of species that can be farmed given a set of specific envi-
ronmental conditions. The suitability of the environments is depen-
dent on biological factors (e.g. species environmental preferences 
and tolerances), socio-economic (e.g. management restrictions) and 
technological factor (e.g. availability of technology to farm offshore; 
Oyinlola et al., 2018). Species richness relates to the potential for 
diversification of mariculture operation, which contributes to its sus-
tainability (Harvey et al., 2016).
Species distribution models (SDMs) are numerical tools that 
link spe­cies occurrences in time and space with environmental 
conditions—and can, therefore, be used to predict species occur-
rences based on environmental data sets (Elith & Leathwick, 2009; 
Guisan & Zimmermann, 2000). Generally, SDMs generate a statis-
tical or non-parametric relationship between environmental con-
ditions such as temperature, oxygen, salinity, pH and other ocean 
variables with species’ occurrences, which are then used to define 
their potential fundamental niche (Hutchinson, 1959). The mod-
els ultimately predict an index of habitat suitability for the spe-
cies around the niche (Elith & Leathwick, 2009). These tools have 
been widely used to assess past, current and future distributions of

terrestrial (Newbold, 2018; Polce et al., 2013) and marine species 
(Cheung, Brodeur, Okey, & Pauly, 2015; Cheung et al., 2010; Jones 
& Cheung, 2014) as well as to quantify the potential suitable marine 
areas for mariculture (Oyinlola et al., 2018).
In this study, we quantify global patterns of MSRP for 85 spe-
cies identified as some of the currently most commonly farmed ma-
rine species in coastal and/or open ocean areas and project future 
trends and patterns under climate change. Specifically, we estimate a 
‘mariculture diversity index’ for a given location and determine how 
it would change by the middle and end of the 21st century under 
strong mitigation and ‘no mitigation policy’ scenarios using an en-
semble model approach with three Earth system models (ESMs) and 
three SDMs. We discuss the implications of our findings for future 
seafood production and the environmental and socio-economic op-
portunities and challenges of climate adaptation for the mariculture 
sector.
2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS
The method applied in this study includes five main steps. First, 
we quantified the historical mean ocean conditions (average of 
1970–2000) suitable for farming aquatic organisms and estimated 
the environmental niche of 85 of the most commonly farmed spe-
cies (Table S1). We then projected their habitat suitability index (HSI) 
over the global ocean based on average historical environmental 
conditions. We further estimated the future habitat suitability index 
for mariculture for each of the 85 currently most commonly farmed 
species under future scenarios of ocean conditions as determined 
by three ESMs. We calculated the changes in mariculture diversity 
based on the model projections and used the averaged outputs (av-
erage across ESMs by spatial cell) to assess the impacts of climate 
change on mariculture. Lastly, we quantified associated model un-
certainties. Details of each step are provided below.
2.1 | Occurrence data
We obtained occurrence records of mariculture farm locations 
within countries' Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) for 85 of the 
most commonly farmed marine species from the georeferenced 
mariculture database developed by and described in Oyinlola 
et  al. (2018). The database was developed by obtaining the list 
of farmed species from the Sea Around Us global mariculture 
database (GMD; www.seaar​oundus.org). We extracted the spe-
cies’ names of all fish and invertebrates reported in the database 
(307 in total)—excluding all records not at the species level. Using 
all subnational units where farms are recorded in the GMD, we 
visually identified mariculture installations (i.e. tanks, pens, cages 
and lines) based on satellite imagery available from Google Earth 
(http://www.google.com/earth/​). The coordinates of each instal-
lation were then extracted using the Google Earth placemark 
tool (Trujillo, Piroddi, & Jacquet, 2012). All species’ farm location 
records were converted to a binary of presence or absence and 
rasterized on a regular spatial grid of 0.5° latitude × 0.5° longitude 
over the global ocean.
We focused on these species because of their high economic and 
nutritional importance. Together, these species accounted for about 
70% of all mariculture production out of 307 taxa farmed globally 
in 2015. These 85 species also met the minimum occurrence data 
requirements of more than seven subnational units for SDMs (Elith 
et al., 2006), that in turn allow greater model accuracy when pro-
jecting future changes. These species included 55 chordates and 30 
molluscs.
2.2 | Environmental data
We assembled data sets for eight environmental parameters: 
sea surface temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, chlo-
rophyll-a concentration, salinity, pH, silicate concentration, cur-
rent velocity and euphotic depth. We obtained 10-year averaged 
ocean current velocity data (1992–2002) from Estimating the 
Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) Project (http://www.
ecco-group.org). We gathered values for temperature, pH, dis-
solved oxygen concentration, salinity, silicate concentration and 
chlorophyll-a concentration (the latter two parameters are used 
as proxy for food source for molluscs; Newell, 2004; Oyinlola 
et al., 2018; Pilditch, Grant, & Bryan, 2001) from three ESMs that 
were part of the Coupled Models Inter-comparison Project Phase 
5 (CMIP5): (a) the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Earth 
System Model 2M (GFDLESM2M), (b) the Institute Pierre Simon 
Laplace coupled model version 5 (IPSL; IPSL-CM5-MR), and (c) the 
Max Planck Institute for Meteorology Earth System Model (MPI-
ESM-MR) and averaged over the period 1970–2000 for each ESM. 
All environmental data were interpolated using bilinear methods 
(Legendre & Legendre, 2012) over the global ocean (189.75°W 
to 179.75°E and 89.75°N to 89.75°S) on a regular spatial grid of 
0.5° latitude × 0.5° longitude (the same as occurrence rasterized 
data) and for two vertical layers: surface (0–10 m) and sea bottom 
depth, where available.
2.3 | Habitat suitability index
We used a multispecies distribution model approach to determine 
areas that would be considered as suitable for farming the 85 selected 
species. First, we harmonized the coordinates of the rasterized farm 
location data and environmental data on a regular spatial grid of 
0.5°  ×  0.5° and determined the environmental quality parameters 
that best explain the occurrences of farming locations using the ei-
genvalue diagram (Oyinlola et al., 2018) implemented in the Ecological 
Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA; Basille, Calenge, Marboutin, Andersen, 
& Gaillard, 2008). The diagram was constructed based on the depar-
ture of the ecological niche from the mean habitat for each species, 
thus identifying the species’ preference for particular environmental

parameters among the whole set of parameters. We selected the es-
sential collection of environmental parameters by determining the di-
rection where ‘specialization’ is highest. The specialization is a measure 
of the narrowness of the niche; in other words, the higher the speciali-
zation, the more restricted the niche. These selected environmental 
parameters represent the essential water physio-chemical parameters 
needed for farming each species and are used in predicting the habitat 
suitability index of the SDMs.
We then computed current MSRP using three SDMs: Gradient 
Boosting Machine (GBM; Ayyadevara, 2018; Friedman, 2002), 
Surface Range Envelope (SRE; Busby, 1991) and Maximum Entropy 
(MAXENT; Phillips, Anderson, & Schapire, 2006). Next, we applied 
each model to estimate the habitat suitability index (HSI) of each 
species for each gridded cell of the ocean (i.e. 0.5° × 0.5°). The HSI 
scales from 0 to 1 (low to high) to indicate the environmental suit-
ability of the selected environmental conditions for each species in 
each spatial cell.
2.4 | Present suitable areas for mariculture
We identified an area as potentially suitable for mariculture based on 
the SDMs' results, and a set of additional environmental and socio-
economic constraints. First, by comparing the predicted HSI with 
current gridded farm location data, we determined the minimum 
HSI above which mariculture can potentially occur. The thresholds 
were identified at the species level by quantifying a species’ 'preva-
lence' (i.e. the fraction of cells in which the species is present; Phillips 
et  al., 2009). We set the known farm locations' HSI as 'presence' 
and the locations with suitable HSI but no farms as 'absence' and 
evaluated 'prevalence' using the evaluate function in the R dismo 
package (Hijmans, Phillips, Leathwick, Elith, & Hijmans, 2017). The 
predictive values of habitat suitability for mariculture below the 
prevalence value were assigned 0 and predicted HSI values higher 
than the prevalence value were assigned 1. Second, we assumed that 
farm operations would not extend beyond a country's EEZ. Third, 
we assumed that mariculture activities would be restricted by cur-
rents and only included spatial cells with a current velocity between 
10 cm/s and 100 cm/s (Kapetsky et al., 2013). Lastly, as most marine 
protected areas (MPAs) do not allow aquaculture, existing MPAs, as 
documented in the Atlas of Marine Protection (http://www.mpatl​
as.org/), were not considered as suitable areas for future marine aq-
uaculture activities (Table 1).
2.5 | Model testing
We tested the robustness of the SDM outputs by comparing the pre-
dicted HSI with reference records of species occurrences. We ran 
the model with 75% of all records as a training data set to develop 
each SDM and calculate each species’ HSI. The remaining 25% of the 
data were used for model evaluation. The Area Under the Receiver 
Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) for each set of model pre-
dictions was calculated using the ROCR package in R (Sing, Sander, 
Beerenwinkel, & Lengauer, 2005). AUC values range from 0 to 1, 
with 0.5 indicating that the model is no better than a random sample 
of values, and 1 indicating that the model has high predictive power. 
The individual species model was then used as weighting values for 
the multimodel ensemble (Jones & Cheung, 2014).
2.6 | Projection of future suitability index
Model projections for the future suitability of the ocean for farm-
ing of the 85 species included in this study under climate change 
were run using outputs from three ESMs in CMIP5: GFDL-ESM-2M; 
IPSL-CM5-MR and MPI-ESM-MR. Two climate change scenarios 
were considered: Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6 
and RCP 8.5, commonly referred to as the ‘strong mitigation’ and ‘no 
mitigation policy’ greenhouse gas emission scenarios respectively. 
We present the individual ESM output and the multimodel output 
(average across ESM models by spatial cell).
2.7 | Analysis
We analysed the global pattern of change in MSRP from 1995 to 2100 
under the two climate change scenarios. We estimated the MSRP in 
each 0.5°  ×  0.5° cell and then calculated the total number of spe-
cies that could be potentially farmed in each EEZ for the 85 selected

species for each year from 1995 to 2100. We then estimated the 
global and regional percentage change in MSRP in the 2000s (i.e. an 
average of 1995–2015), the 2050s (i.e. an average of 2040–2060) and 
the 2090s (i.e. an average of 2080–2100). Percentage change in MSRP 
was estimated for all potential mariculture countries, countries with 
currently existing mariculture activities and at the species level. Using 
model outputs, we discuss the potential opportunities and challenges 
for the future sustainable development of global mariculture. All mod-
els and analyses were run using the statistical programming software 
R (R Core Team, 2018) and maps were made in Matlab (MATLAB and 
Statistics Toolbox Release 2018b, 2018).
3 | RESULTS
3.1 | Model evaluation
All three models estimate distributions of MSRP that are strongly sup-
ported by observations, as indicated by the high AUC model values 
(Figure S1). The AUC values varied among ESMs and SDMs, with the 
25th and 75th percentiles of Surface Range Envelope (SRE; Average 
AUC across all ESM models) predictions having AUC values of 0.76 
and 0.91 across models respectively (an AUC value of 0.5 indicates 
that a model's prediction is no better than random choice). Maximum 
Entropy (MAXENT) and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) had the 
highest AUC values; with both scoring AUC values of 0.91 and 0.95 
for the 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively. The 25th and 75th per-
centiles of the estimated prevalence value for each species (i.e. the HSI 
threshold below which the marine area was considered unsuitable for 
culturing the specific modelled species) ranged from 0.32 to 0.65.
3.2 | Current mariculture richness and potentially 
suitable marine area for mariculture
Our model predicted the current pattern of MSRP across all mod-
els for the reference time (2000s, average between 1995 and 
2015) under the strong mitigation RCP 2.6 and ‘no mitigation 
policy’ scenarios RCP 8.5 (Figure 1a). Results show similar trends 
under both scenarios. MSRP was highest in the north subtropics 
(66.5°N and 35.5°N; Figure 1b), particularly the East China Sea 
(species richness = 25–53 across RCP scenarios) and north of the 
Gulf of Mexico (species richness = 15–45 across RCP scenarios). 
Lowest MSRP was estimated for the North Frigid Zone (i.e. Arctic; 
90°N and 66.5°N). Other noticeable areas of richness include the 
southwestern Atlantic coast (species richness  =  30–45 across 
RCP scenarios) and West Africa (species richness  =  35–40 
across RCP scenarios), the Yellow Sea (species richness = 30–50 
across RCP scenarios) and the Caribbean Sea (species rich-
ness = 20–40 across RCP scenarios).
Also, under both scenarios (RCP 2.6 and 8.5), we estimated a 
total of 113 million km2 of suitable marine area for the mariculture 
of all 85 selected species in the 2000s (Figure 2), ranging at the re-
gional level from 66 million km2 in the tropics to 7.8 million km2 in 
the Arctic. Total suitable area for finfish and molluscs was estimated 
at 83 million km2 and 49 million km2, respectively.

3.3 | Climate change mediated impacts on 
mariculture species richness and potentially suitable 
marine mariculture areas
Relative to current (1995–2015) MSRP, projected future MSRP 
only changed slightly globally. Under RCP 2.6, the model ensemble 
projected an increase in MSRP of 1.02% ± 0.59 (standard error) by 
the 2050s (average between 2040 and 2060) and 3.35% ± 0.62 by 
the 2090s (average between 2080 and 2100; Table 2, Figure 3a). 
A decrease of 0.49% ± 0.11 was projected by the 2050s and an 
increase of 2.39% ± 0.53 by the 2090s under RCP 8.5 (Table 2, 
Figure 3b).
However, projected changes in MSRP under climate change 
showed important differences across latitudes (Figure 4a,b). The lat-
itudinal average was projected to shift towards the poles (i.e. South 
and North) under the two RCP scenarios. Under RCP 2.6, MSRP in 
the tropics was found to decline by 2.23% ± 21.10 (standard devia-
tion) by the 2050s relative to the 2000s, compared to a decline of 
10.08% ± 25.72 under RCP 8.5 over the same time frame. An increase 
of about 19.69% ± 47.1 was observed between 90°N and 66.5°N 
under RCP 2.6 compared to a projected increase of 41.11% ± 42.19 
under RCP 8.5, for the same time period.
Under RCP 2.6, the model ensemble projected a decline of 
1.42% ± 0.31 (standard deviation) in the marine area suitable for mari-
culture by the 2050s and 1.20% ± 0.26 by the 2090s (Figure 2a). A 
decline of 2.01% ± 0.52 and 3.69% ± 0.59 was projected by the 2050s 
and 2090s, respectively, under the RCP 8.5 scenario (Figure 2b). 
Similarly, global potentially suitable mariculture area was projected 
to decline by 1.95%  ±  0.89 under RCP 2.6, and by 1.48%  ±  0.72 
under RCP 8.5 by the 2050s for finfish (Figure 2c). For molluscs, the 
total marine area potentially suitable for mariculture declined by 
5.26% ± 3.29 and 6.36% ± 3.34 under RCP 2.6 and 8.5 respectively 
(Figure 2d).

the Pacific coast of Canada, southern Chile and the Philippines were 
projected to lose in finfish MSRP (Figure 6a). However, we projected 
a slight increase in molluscs’ MSRP (Figure 6b). Under RCP 8.5, mod-
erate levels of decline (approximately 20%) were projected for the 
Caribbean Sea, and waters around Europe, Morocco, Japan and 
Australia. Increases in currently utilized EEZs for selected farmed 
species were projected for Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada 
(60%–70%), parts of Argentina's EEZ (10%–20%), around India (20%–
80%), Turkey and Greece (5%–20%), Natal—Brazil (10%–60%) and

Although the impact on climate change on potentially suitable mari-
culture areas for the 85 species studied in this paper was projected 
to be small, some farmed species and associated farming areas were 
projected to be particularly affected by climate change (Figure 7; 
Figure S4 for map). By the mid - 21st century, Australia and Canada's 
Pacific coast, for example, were projected to lose about 32% and 
60%, respectively, of potentially suitable marine area for farming 
Atlantic salmon (Figure 7a) under RCP 2.6. However, the loss was 
projected to be 60% and 84% for both areas respectively under RCP 
8.5. In contrast, for the same timeframe, the area potentially suitable

for farming Atlantic salmon in Norway was projected to increase by 
about 29% and 48% under RCP 2.6 and 8.5, respectively, and by 
100% under both scenarios for Sweden (Figure 7a). Our models con-
sistently projected that Cobia farming in Panama would be strongly 
impacted under RCP 8.5, with a near total loss in potentially suitable 
area (Figure 7b). In contrast, under RCP 2.6, the country was pro-
jected to gain close to 21% more potentially suitable marine area for 
culturing Cobia. Potentially suitable area for European sea bass farm-
ing was projected to increase in Greece (3%), Atlantic France (7%) 
and Malta (10%) under RCP 2.6; however, declines were projected 
under RCP 8.5 for both Greece (2%) and Atlantic France (21%), while 
findings showed Malta would gain (23%) potentially suitable marine 
areas by mid-century relative to the 2000s (Figure 7c). In total, 19 
EEZs were projected to gain more suitable area for the farming of 
Pacific cupped oyster under RCP 2.6, with highest gains in New 
Caledonia (42%), the west coast of the USA (34%) and the subarctic 
region around Alaska (32%). Under RCP 8.5, we projected 15 EEZs 
to gain potentially suitable area for the same species (Figure 7d), 
with subarctic Alaska, Morocco and the west coast of Canada reg-
istering the highest gains at 83%, 55% and 46%, respectively. New 
Caledonia, France and Italy were projected to face losses of 100%, 
67% and 58%, respectively, under RCP 8.5.
4 | DISCUSSION
In recent years, the growth of global mariculture production has 
helped maintain a relatively stable seafood supply in the world 
(Campbell & Pauly, 2013; FAO, 2018), with aquaculture being consid-
ered the fastest growing food system globally (FAO, 2018). However, 
our findings highlight the uncertainties associated with the future 
development of global mariculture (both marine and brackish aq-
uaculture). We projected a large-scale redistribution of mariculture 
species diversity and changes in potential areas suitable for mari-
culture in the world's oceans. Specifically, under climate change, we 
projected gains in MSRP at higher latitudes, and losses throughout 
much of the tropics, in line with previous findings (Froehlich et al., 
2018; Handisyde et al., 2006; Porter et al., 2014).
Species diversification has been identified as an essential strat-
egy toward increasing food supply from aquaculture: a necessary 
action to improve the aquaculture food sector's profitability and 
flexibility (Harvey et al., 2016). Some studies (Harvey et al., 2016; 
Le François, Jobling, & Carter, 2010) have argued that species diver-
sification could lend the sector resilience, particularly under climate 
change. Our results clearly highlight that such species diversification 
would need to consider the projected impacts of a changing climate 
on the diversity of species that can be potentially farmed, partic-
ularly in the tropics that currently boast high species richness, but 
stand to register the greatest losses in the future. Such care is all the 
more needed, given the sector's contribution to nutrition and food 
security (Thilsted et al., 2016), and considering projected declines in 
capture fisheries under climate change (Cheung et al., 2010). Also, 
suitable marine areas for valuable economic species such as Atlantic 
salmon, Cobia and European bass will be lost, particularly in top pro-
ducing countries. However, careful selection of species could avoid 
some of the socio-economic losses linked to climate change. For in-
stance, while Atlantic salmon farming marine areas along Canada's 
Pacific coast EEZ are projected to be impacted under both green-
house gases scenarios (i.e. RCP 2.6 and 8.5), the potentially suitable 
marine area for Pacific cupped oyster stands to increase substan-
tially in this EEZ.
Although our study projected that future Arctic ocean condi-
tions would be suitable for mariculture operations, and could see an 
increase in MSRP, this region is unlikely to support mariculture de-
velopment from a conservation and governance perspective. While 
mariculture operations in the Arctic region contributed about 2% of 
total world aquaculture production in 2015 (Troell, Eide, Isaksen, 
Hermansen, & Crepin, 2017), Arctic ocean ecosystems are generally 
considered sensitive to human activities (Meier et al., 2014; Riedel, 
2014). Thus, the expansion of mariculture activities in the Arctic 
could conceivably have a considerable impact on marine biodiver-
sity and ecosystem functions. Such impacts would be exacerbated 
if the development of operations was to take place in the absence 
of effective environmental management and regulations, result-
ing in ecological impacts through, for example, excessive nutrient 
and chemical outflows from the farms (Ivanov, Smagina, Chivilev, 
& Kruglikov, 2013), escapes of farmed fish (Jensen et al., 2013), as 
well as the risk of disease and parasite transfer from farmed to wild 
stocks (Palm, 2011). Opening the Arctic region to aquaculture activi-
ties may also further exacerbate the region's vulnerability to climate 
change.
The important losses in marine diversity and potentially suitable 
area for mariculture projected under RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 for trop-
ical regions underscore the considerable threat that climate change 
presents to areas that currently contribute a substantial amount to 
food fish production and that also depend on a large proportion of 
that production for local food security, income and employment 
(FAO, 2018). Aquaculture is viewed as critical to supporting food se-
curity throughout developing tropical countries due to the static or 
declining contributions by capture fisheries to the food fish basket 
(Brummett, Lazard, & Moehl, 2008). However, mariculture may not 
be the panacea to nutritional security, particularly for developing 
countries, has it is perceived (Bogard, Marks, Mamun, & Thilsted, 
2017; Golden et al., 2016).
Our findings underline the importance of this uncertainty. Our re-
sults show climate change impacts on mollusc mariculture to be more 
apparent than finfish. This might be because of the northward shift in 
potentially suitable marine areas for finfish and the resilience of fin-
fish (Froehlich et al., 2018) under global increasing greenhouse gases. 
While our study focused on species richness in mariculture, our results 
are in line with those of other studies that have examined the role of 
climate change on aquaculture (Froehlich et al., 2018; Klinger et al., 
2017). Notably, the three studies point to a loss in suitable marine area 
and biomass in mariculture production in the tropics and subtropical 
region, and conversely an increase in both suitable area and biomass 
in temperate regions under increasing greenhouse gas emissions. In

OYINLOLA et al.
addition, for countries where mariculture has been an essential part of 
the coastal economy (Froehlich et al., 2018; e.g. China), if the loss in 
potentially suitable mariculture area were to translate into a reduction 
in growth performance and subsequent reduction in aquaculture pro-
duction output, this could be detrimental to the sustainable develop-
ment of these coastal communities (Singh et al., 2018).
Our results further lend credence to previous findings pointing 
out that changes in ocean conditions because of climate change 
would affect the suitable environmental area that supports 
the farming of aquatic species in open water farming systems 
(Froehlich et al., 2018; Klinger et al., 2017; Oyinlola et al., 2018). 
Mariculture species perform best within a stress-free environ-
ment. Hence, to optimize production and be most cost-effective, 
farmers strive to locate ocean-based facilities within the optimal 
oceanic environment for the farmed species (Benetti, Benetti, 
Rivera, Sardenberg, & O’Hanlon, 2010). In this study, we ascer-
tained the best combination of oceanic parameters to achieve 
optimal growth conditions for each of the 85 currently most com-
monly farmed species (Basille et al., 2008; Oyinlola et al., 2018) 
using three different models. Such quantitative methods and mod-
els represent useful tools to inform the aquaculture sector of the 
possible risks and likely vulnerabilities of their current and planned 
operations under climate change. However, other socio-economic 
and governance factors play essential roles in determining over-
all mariculture productivity (Davies et al., 2019), and future work 
would benefit from building on work presented in this study to 
focus on an evaluation of these dimensions for the future of mari-
culture under climate change.
While this study focused specifically on the effects of climate 
change on the environmental suitability for mariculture species, 
there are a number of other direct and indirect impacts of climate 
change on mariculture that may render the future viability and sus-
tainability of mariculture production uncertain. Body size of finfish 
is expected to decline for open water systems due to increases in 
temperature limiting oxygen for optimal growth (Pauly & Cheung, 
2017). Higher temperatures could also exacerbate the prevalence 
of aquaculture-related diseases and parasitic infections (Karvonen, 
Rintamaki, Jokela, & Valtonen, 2010; Lafferty et al., 2015; Walker 
& Mohan, 2009) resulting in sizeable economic losses to producing 
countries, in addition to estimated losses in potentially suitable 
mariculture areas. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have caused major 
mortality losses in the aquaculture sector in different regions of 
the world (e.g. pacific Canada and Chile; Apablaza et  al., 2017; 
Haigh & Esenkulova, 2014; Lembeye, 2008; Rensel & Whyte, 
2003; Rosa et al., 2013), leading to substantial losses in revenue 
and employment (Rensel & Whyte, 2003). Studies have shown that 
under increasing greenhouse gas emissions, the frequency, inten-
sity and geographic extent of HABs may also increase (Berdalet 
et al., 2015; Glibert et al., 2014). Simulations indicate that climate 
change will negatively impact the abundance and maximum catch 
potential of forage fish from capture fisheries (Cheung et al., 2016, 
2010) leading to a possible reduction in fishmeal and fish oil sup-
ply, which may affect aquafeed production. Substantial declines 
in agricultural yields have been projected to occur in most regions 
of the world (Nelson et al., 2009; Piao et al., 2010; Schlenker & 
Lobell, 2010), further impacting the supply of (plant source in) 
aquafeeds. Future growth and production estimates also will be 
shaped by a number of indirect socio-economic factors such as 
population, technology and consumption patterns. Future studies 
should focus on how these may impact mariculture production in 
the future.
Our approach of integrating three models to simulate changes 
in the potentially suitable marine area available for farming and 
MSRP enables us to explore the structural uncertainty of pro-
jected species distributions based on their environment (Cheung 
et al., 2016). GBM and MAXENT had the highest AUC values. In 
the case of GBM, this may be due to the model's ability to build 
some regression trees sequentially from pseudo-residuals by 
least squares at each iteration (Friedman, 2002). This attribute 
helps GBM correct errors made by previously trained regression 
trees. In GBM, a ‘tree’ is made up of random subsamples of the 
data set incrementally improving the model (Moisen et al., 2006). 
With MAXENT, the model provides the user with the ability to 
weight input variables (Jones & Cheung, 2014), thereby preventing 
over-fitting of the model by determining how much the likelihood 
should be penalized. Likelihood penalization is necessary to con-
trol model complexity and the variance of the estimated suitability 
index (Hutchinson et al., 2015; Murphy, 2012).
Nevertheless, there are limitations to our modelling approach. 
SDMs may not always adequately quantify species' environmental 
preference ranges. This is because SDMs assume that environmen-
tal preference ranges are determined only by climate variables and 
that an equilibrium exists between the realized species range and its 
potential range as defined by climate variables (Pearson & Dawson, 
2003). Also, model inaccuracies may occur particularly in coastal wa-
ters because of the resolution of the farm location data set and how 
we allocated mariculture farm locations so they match the resolution 
of the climate data (e.g. based on 0.5° latitude × 0.5° longitude). The 
ESMs projections are available at 50 km resolution, while farm loca-
tions were mapped at a resolution of 1 km. Hence, ESM data miss 
local-level variability typically experienced at the farm level. Other 
studies (Barbosa, Real, & Vargas, 2010; Ehrlen & Morris, 2015; Freer, 
Partridge, Tarling, Collins, & Genner, 2018; Guisan & Thuiller, 2005) 
have arrived at similar conclusions regarding the limitations and un-
certainty in the use of ESM projections in combination with species 
occurrence data. The aim of this study was to focus on the future of 
aquaculture at the global level and examine regional changes in po-
tential mariculture species richness (see Supplementary Information 
for averaged results across EEZs). Future studies should focus on 
projections at the regional and national scale and use downscaled 
climate data and other relevant data sets at resolutions relevant to 
such analyses.
Our results underscore that future climate change impacts will 
impact some regions more strongly than others, and can help in-
form actions required to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate

organisms for food production. While our findings clearly highlight 
that future changes in the marine environment will significantly 
impact mariculture activities, extreme events and their likelihood 
to increase in severity and frequency will also need to be given 
due consideration. Similarly, proximity to markets, conflicts with 
other oceans users and availability of local aquafeed ingredients 
will continue to be important determinants of aquaculture species 
diversification and production. Integration of these considerations 
together with a review of marine aquaculture zoning and site selec-
tion factoring in climate change will be needed to improve the adap-
tive capacity of the sector, contribute to reducing uncertainties and 
minimize impacts on production and dependent socio-economics of 
mariculture countries. In addition, hybridization and development 
of new species strains that have better survival rates at higher tem-
peratures and lower oxygen levels should be encouraged through 
research and development. Future increases and improvements in 
cost-effective technology should also improve land-based opera-
tions. Lastly, it is important to consider that the sustainability of the 
future expansion of mariculture may in part, be linked to the effec-
tiveness of conservation and governance measures. Policymakers 
must set clear objectives for future mariculture sustainability ef-
forts and ensure the rule of law and due process are followed and 
enforced.

DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT
Mariculture locations and production data are available from the Sea 
Around Us global mariculture database (http://www.seaar​oundus.
org/). Species ecological information from FishBase (http://www.fishb​
ase.org/) and the Encyclopaedia of life (http://eol.org/). Species oc-
currence data from Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS, 
http://www.iobis.org/), Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF, 
http://www.gbif.org/), FishBase (http://www.fishb​ase.org/) and the 
International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN, http://www.
iucnr​edlist.org/techn​ical-docum​ents/spati​al-data). Annual climatology 
for the period 1955–2012 for temperature, salinity, dissolved oxy-
gen concentration and silicate concentration were obtained from the 
World Ocean Atlas 2013 (http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/woa13/​). 
Euphotic depth and chlorophyll-a concentration annual climatology 
for the period from 1998 to 2012 were downloaded from the Ocean 
Colour website (http://ocean​color.gsfc.nasa.gov). Ocean current veloc-
ity data (1992–2002) from the ECCO Project (http://www.ecco-group.
org). Environmental parameters: sea surface temperature, dissolved 
oxygen concentration, chlorophyll-a concentration, salinity, pH, sili-
cate concentration and euphotic depth are from the three ESMs that 
were part of the Coupled Models Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 
(CMIP5): (a) the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Earth System 
Model 2M (GFDLESM2M), (b) the Institute Pierre Simon Laplace 
coupled model version 5 (IPSL; IPSL-CM5-MR), and (c) the Max 
Planck Institute for Meteorology Earth System Model (MPI-ESM-MR).
