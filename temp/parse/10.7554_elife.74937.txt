Abstract 
22 
 
23 
The accurate processing of contrast is the basis for all visually guided behaviors. Visual scenes 
24 
with rapidly changing illumination challenge contrast computation, because adaptation is not fast 
25 
enough to compensate for such changes. Yet, human perception of contrast is stable even when 
26 
the visual environment is quickly changing. The fruit fly Drosophila also shows nearly luminance 
27 
invariant behavior for both ON and OFF stimuli. To achieve this, first-order interneurons L1, L2 
28 
and L3 all encode contrast and luminance differently, and distribute information across both ON 
29 
and OFF contrast-selective pathways. Behavioral responses to both ON and OFF stimuli rely on 
30 
a luminance-based correction provided by L1 and L3, wherein L1 supports contrast computation 
31 
linearly, and L3 non-linearly amplifies dim stimuli. Therefore, L1, L2 and L3 are not distinct inputs 
32 
to ON and OFF pathways but the lamina serves as a separate processing layer that distributes 
33 
distinct luminance and contrast information across ON and OFF pathways to support behavioral 
34 
performance in varying conditions.

Introduction 
36 
  
37 
Across species, contrast information forms the basis of visual computations. For our perception 
38 
to be stable, our eyes must compute contrast relative to the mean illumination of a scene. In 
39 
natural environments, illumination changes by several orders of magnitude not only from dawn to 
40 
dusk, but also at much faster timescales as our eyes saccade across a scene or we quickly move 
41 
from sun to shade (Frazor and Geisler, 2006; Mante et al., 2005; Rieke and Rudd, 2009).Thus, 
42 
the computation of contrast needs to be invariant to rapid changes in luminance, such that visual 
43 
perception of a given contrast remains constant. This is accomplished by human perception, and 
44 
neuronal responses in the cat lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) display contrast constancy at rapid 
45 
time scales (Burkhardt et al., 1984; Mante et al., 2005). However, contrast encoding in 
46 
photoreceptors is not luminance invariant when the stimulus changes more rapidly than 
47 
photoreceptor adaptation (Laughlin and Hardie, 1978; Normann and Werblin, 1974).  
48 
  
49 
The visual OFF pathway in fruit flies, sensitive to contrast decrements, also displays contrast-
50 
constant behavior (Ketkar et al., 2020) , allowing to investigate the underlying mechanisms. In the 
51 
OFF pathway, luminance information itself is maintained postsynaptic to photoreceptors, and is 
52 
crucial for the accurate estimation of contrast, resulting in contrast-constant behavior. Luminance 
53 
serves as a corrective signal that scales contrast computation when background luminance 
54 
quickly changes (Ketkar et al., 2020). The requirement of such a corrective signal can be 
55 
theoretically expected regardless of ON and OFF contrast polarities, since the adaptational 
56 
constraints in dynamic environments challenge both contrast polarities. However, the ON and 
57 
OFF pathways are not mere sign-inverted versions of each other since they face different 
58 
environmental challenges (Clark et al., 2014; Ruderman, 1994) and have evolved several 
59 
structural and physiological asymmetries (Chichilnisky and Kalmar, 2002; Jin et al., 2011; 
60 
Leonhardt et al., 2016; Ratliff et al., 2010). It is thus not clear if this luminance invariance is a 
61 
general feature of all visual pathways, and how luminance and contrast information are distributed 
62 
across visual pathways to establish contrast constancy is not known. 
63 
  
64 
Drosophila melanogaster offers a promising model system to study the pathway-specific function 
65 
of luminance since the ON and OFF motion pathways have been well characterized on the 
66 
cellular, circuit and behavioral levels (Behnia et al., 2014; Yang and Clandinin, 2018). In the fly 
67 
visual system, neurons were assigned to distinct ON or OFF pathways based on physiological 
68 
properties (Molina-Obando et al., 2019; Serbe et al., 2016; Shinomiya et al., 2019; Silies et al., 
69 
2013; Strother et al., 2017), anatomical connectivity (Shinomiya et al., 2014; Takemura et al., 
70 
2015, 2013, 2017), and behavioral function (Clark et al., 2011; Silies et al., 2013). ON and OFF 
71 
contrast selectivity first arises two synapses downstream of photoreceptors, in medulla neurons 
72 
(Fischbach and Dittrich, 1989; Serbe et al., 2016; Silies et al., 2013; Strother et al., 2017; Yang 
73 
et al., 2016). They receive photoreceptor information through the lamina neurons L1-L3, which 
74 
project to specific medulla layers (Meinertzhagen and O’Neil, 1991; Strother et al., 2014). 
75 
Although L1-L3 all show the same response polarity, and hyperpolarize to light onset and 
76 
depolarize to light offset, L1 projects to layers where it mostly connects to ON-selective medulla 
77 
neurons. Similarly, L2 and L3 project to layers where OFF-selective medulla neurons get most of 
78 
their inputs (Shinomiya et al., 2014; Takemura et al., 2015, 2013). L1 is thus thought to be the 
79

sole major input of the ON pathway, whereas L2 and L3 are considered the two major inputs of 
80 
the OFF pathway (Figure 1A) (Clark et al., 2011; Joesch et al., 2008; Shinomiya et al., 2019). 
81 
Among these, L2 is contrast-sensitive, but cannot support contrast constancy alone if 
82 
photoreceptor adaptation is insufficient. Instead, contrast constancy in OFF-motion guided 
83 
behavior is ensured by a corrective signal from luminance-sensitive L3 neurons (Ketkar et al., 
84 
2020). It is not known whether ON-motion driven behavior also requires luminance information 
85 
and whether L1 can provide it along with its contrast signal (Figure 1B). 
86 
Contrast and luminance are both encoded by the transient and sustained response components 
87 
in both vertebrates and invertebrate photoreceptors (Laughlin and Hardie, 1978; Normann and 
88 
Perlman, 1979; Normann and Werblin, 1974; Shapley and Enroth-Cugell, 1984), which are 
89 
captured differentially by their downstream neurons. In the vertebrate retina, many different types 
90 
of first order interneurons, bipolar cells, exist. Although they are generally thought to capture the 
91 
contrast component of the photoreceptors response, luminance information has been shown be 
92 
preserved in post-photoreceptor visual circuitry post of the retina (Awatramani and Slaughter, 
93 
2000; Ichinose and Hellmer, 2016; Ichinose and Lukasiewicz, 2007; Odermatt et al., 2012; Oesch 
94 
and Diamond, 2011). As suggested by their sustained response component, different degrees of 
95 
luminance-sensitivity exists across bipolar cell types (Baden et al., 2016; Euler et al., 2014). 
96 
Furthermore, ON and OFF contrast selectivity emerges at the bipolar cell layer, where ON 
97 
selectivity emerges through glutamatergic inhibition (Masu et al., 1995). These ON and OFF 
98 
bipolar cells also split anatomically, as they innervate different layers (Euler et al., 2014).   
99 
Together, many parallels exist between the Drosophila visual system and the vertebrate retina, 
100 
including the response properties of photoreceptors, the layered organization and the existence 
101 
of ON and OFF pathways (Clark and Demb, 2016; Mauss et al., 2017). However, in contrast to 
102 
the vertebrate retina, fewer first order interneuron types distribute contrast and luminance 
103 
information, and contrast selectivity itself clearly only occurs one synapse further downstream, 
104 
where neurons postsynaptic to lamina neurons are either ON or OFF selective. Comparing the 
105 
vertebrate retina with the insect visual system, it is unclear how just three first order interneurons 
106 
distribute their different physiological properties across visual pathways.  
107 
  
108 
Here, we show that luminance and contrast information is distributed to, and is of behavioral 
109 
relevance for both ON and OFF pathways. In vivo calcium imaging experiments reveal that each 
110 
first order interneuron is unique in its contrast and luminance encoding properties. Whereas L2 is 
111 
purely contrast sensitive, L1 encodes both contrast and luminance in distinct response 
112 
components. L1 linearly scales with luminance, whereas the luminance-sensitive L3 non-linearly 
113 
amplifies dim light. Behavioral experiments further show that these differential luminance- and 
114 
contrast- encoding properties translate into distinct behavioral roles. In the ON pathway, L1 and 
115 
L3 both provide luminance information for higher luminance invariance than possible by the 
116 
contrast input alone. Furthermore, L2, known as the OFF-pathway contrast input, provides 
117 
contrast information to the ON-pathway, in addition to L1. Surprisingly, both L1 and L3 neurons 
118 
are necessary and sufficient for OFF behavior. These findings indicate that L1 L2, and L3 do not 
119 
constitute ON- or OFF-specific inputs. Instead, the three first-order interneurons encode 
120 
luminance and contrast differentially and contribute to computations in both ON and OFF 
121 
pathways. Together, our data reveal how luminance and contrast information are distributed to

L1 responses to contrast do not explain ON behavior 
128 
Luminance-invariant behavioral responses have been observed in multiple species (Burkhardt et 
129 
al., 1984; Silies et al., 2014), highlighting their ethological relevance. In Drosophila, luminance-
130 
invariant behavior has been shown in response to OFF stimuli, where a dedicated luminance-
131 
sensitive pathway scales contrast-sensitive inputs to achieve luminance invariance in behavior 
132 
(Ketkar et al., 2020). The ON pathway is thought to have just one prominent input, L1. We thus 
133 
asked if luminance invariance is achieved in the ON pathway and if the contrast-sensitive input 
134 
L1 can explain such invariance. For this purpose, we compared turning behavior of walking flies 
135 
with the responses of L1. Behavioral responses were measured in a fly-on-a-ball assay. Flies 
136 
were shown moving ON edges of different luminance but the same 100% Michelson contrast. Fly 
137 
turning responses were highly similar across luminances, with low-luminance edges eliciting 
138 
slightly larger turning responses than brighter edges (Figure 1C).  
139 
 
140 
We wondered if the sole ON pathway input L1 can directly drive this behavior. To test this, we 
141 
examined the contrast responses of L1 to moving ON edges with comparable parameters and 
142 
overlapping luminance values as those used in the behavioral assay (Figure 1D). We recorded 
143 
L1 in vivo calcium responses to visual stimuli from its axon terminals expressing GCaMP6f using 
144 
two-photon microscopy. As described previously, L1 responded negatively to contrast 
145 
increments, in line with the inverted response polarity of lamina neurons (Figure 1D) (Clark et al., 
146 
2011; Laughlin and Hardie, 1978; Yang et al., 2016). The absolute response amplitude of the L1 
147 
calcium signals scaled with luminance and did not co-vary with the behavioral response (Figure 
148 
1E). We performed linear regression across calcium signals at different luminances and quantified 
149 
the slope to extract the luminance dependency of the responses. L1 signals and behavioral 
150 
responses had opposite luminance dependencies (Figure 1E). Thus, the observed behavior, 
151 
approaching luminance invariance, cannot be explained solely by contrast inputs from L1, 
152 
suggesting that the ON-pathway additionally gets luminance-sensitive input.

172 
To explore the sources of luminance information in first-order interneurons, we measured calcium 
173 
signals in L1, L2 and L3. Flies were shown a staircase stimulus with luminance going sequentially 
174 
up and down. L1 and L2 showed positive and negative transient responses when luminance 
175 
stepped down and up, respectively (Figure 2A), consistent with their contrast sensitivity (Clark et 
176 
al., 2011; Silies et al., 2013). L2 did not show any sustained component. L3 showed sustained 
177 
responses to OFF steps and was non-linearly tuned to stimulus luminance, responding strongly 
178 
to the darkest stimulus. Intriguingly, L1 showed a transient component followed by a sustained 
179 
component, suggesting that it encodes luminance in addition to contrast (Figure 2A). The 
180 
sustained components of L1 response were negatively correlated with luminance, such that the 
181 
baseline calcium signal at each step sequentially increased with decreasing stimulus luminance.

To explicitly compare luminance information across the three input neurons, we measured 
195 
responses to randomized luminance and calculated the mutual information between stimulus and 
196 
the sustained response component (Figure 2B-D). As for the staircase stimulus, L2 transient 
197 
responses returned to baseline within the 10s of the stimulus presentation, whereas both L1 and 
198 
L3 displayed sustained components that varied with luminance (Figure 2B,C). Sustained 
199 
response components in L1 and L3 carried similar mutual information with luminance, and both 
200 
were higher than L2 (Figure 2D). Interestingly, the luminance-sensitive response components of 
201 
L1 and L3 scaled differently with luminance. We quantified non-linearity using the difference of 
202 
Pearson’s linear and Spearman’s correlation between response and luminance. This value will 
203 
approach zero if the relationship is linear and increase or decrease if non-linear, depending on 
204 
the sign of correlation between luminance and response. L1 responses were more linear with 
205 
respect to luminance than L3 responses, which selectively amplified low luminance (Figure 2E). 
206 
Thus, the two luminance-sensitive neurons carry different types of luminance information. 
207 
 
208 
L1 is not required but sufficient for ON behavior across luminances 
209 
Since the canonical ON pathway input L1 is also found to carry luminance information, we 
210 
hypothesized that it plays a role in mediating the observed behavior. To test this, we silenced L1 
211 
outputs while measuring ON behavior using Shibirets (Kitamoto, 2001). Silencing L1 severely 
212 
reduced turning responses when different ON contrasts were interleaved, consistent with previous 
213 
behavioral studies that identified L1 as the major input to the ON pathway (Clark et al., 2011; 
214 
Silies et al., 2013) (Supp. Figure 1A-D). However, L1 silencing had little effect on responses to 
215 
100% contrast at varying luminance, suggesting the existence of other ON pathway inputs (Figure 
216 
3A,B). To explicitly test if and how L1 silencing changed the luminance dependence of behavioral 
217 
responses, we quantified the slope of peak turning velocities across different background 
218 
luminances (Figure 3C). The slopes were slightly negative for both the control and L1-silenced 
219 
conditions, and did not differ significantly between conditions, suggesting another luminance input 
220 
masking the L1 contribution. To test this possibility, we asked if L1 is sufficient for ON behavior in 
221 
dynamically changing luminance conditions. We measured behavioral responses after 
222 
functionally isolating L1 from other circuitry downstream of photoreceptors. To achieve this, we 
223 
selectively rescued expression of the histamine-gated chloride channel Ort in ort-mutant flies, 
224 
which otherwise lack communication between photoreceptors and their postsynaptic neurons. 
225 
Behavioral responses of ort mutant control flies were absent, indicating that ON-motion behavior 
226 
fully depends on Ort (Figure 3D). Heterozygous ort controls turned with the moving 100% contrast 
227 
ON edges at all luminances (Figure 3E). Flies in which ort expression was rescued in L1 
228 
responded to ON motion at all luminances, and indistinguishable from controls (Figure 3F), 
229 
showing that L1 can mediate normal turning behavior to ON edges at all luminances. This data 
230 
confirms L1’s general importance in the ON pathway and additionally highlights its behaviorally 
231 
relevant role of its luminance-sensitive component.

L1 and L3 together provide luminance signals required for ON behavior 
244 
 
245 
Our data suggest the existence of a second luminance input to the ON-pathway. In the OFF 
246 
pathway, the luminance-sensitive L3 neuron provides the necessary luminance-based correction 
247 
to achieve contrast constancy (Ketkar et al., 2020). Connectomics data suggest that L3 could 
248 
provide input to the ON pathway as well (Takemura et al., 2013). To test the hypothesis that L3 
249 
also provides a luminance signal to approach luminance-invariant ON responses, we measured 
250 
behavioral responses to a set of 100% contrast ON edges at five different luminances while 
251 
silencing L3 synaptic outputs (Figure 4A,B). Interestingly, unlike controls, L3-silenced flies 
252 
responded stronger to all ON edges, revealing an unexplored, inhibitory role of L3. However, the 
253 
responses of L3-silenced flies were still highly similar across luminances. This demonstrates that, 
254 
like L1, L3 is not alone required for the near-invariant ON pathway behavior. Unlike controls, L3 
255 
silenced flies did not show a slight increase in turning amplitude at lower edge luminance, also 
256 
reflected in the differences in their slopes (Figure 4C), suggesting that L3 inputs to the ON 
257 
pathway also contribute to behavior in a luminance-dependent manner. To further explore this, 
258 
we next asked if L3 is sufficient for ON behavior and functionally isolated L3 from other circuitry. 
259 
L3 rescue flies turned to ON edges at all luminances tested (Figure 4D) and significantly rescued 
260 
turning behavior at low luminances compared to ort mutant flies (Figure 4E), showing that L3 is 
261 
sufficient for ON behavior at low luminances. This further reflects L3’s nonlinear preference for 
262 
dim light seen at the physiological level (Ketkar et al., 2020), (Figure 2C). 
263 
 
264 
We found that L3 is a second luminance input to the ON-pathway that, together with L1, supports 
265 
luminance-invariant responses in ON behavior. To test this, we silenced the outputs of both L1 
266 
and L3 simultaneously while measuring ON behavior across luminance. Flies still turned to the 
267 
moving ON edges. However, turning responses of flies lacking both L1 and L3 functional outputs 
268 
were no longer luminance invariant and turned less than controls in a luminance-dependent 
269 
manner (Figure 4F,G). Intriguingly, behavioral responses now scaled positively with the edge 
270 
luminance (Figure 4H), qualitatively recapitulating the LMC contrast-sensitive responses. Thus, 
271 
L1 and L3 can together account for the luminance information available to the ON pathway. To 
272 
analyze the extent of the individual contributions of L1 and L3, we compared L1 and L3 ort rescues 
273 
by computing rescue efficiency, defined as the fraction of the difference between positive and 
274 
negative control behaviors. Whereas L1 fully rescued turning behavior to ON edges at all 
275 
luminances, L3 significantly rescued turning behavior selectively at low luminances (Figure 4I). 
276 
Taken together, L1 and L3 both provide distinct types of luminance information to the ON pathway 
277 
(Figure 4J). Because flies lacking both of these neurons still respond to ON contrast, our data 
278 
suggest the existence of an unidentified contrast input.

The contrast-sensitive L2 provides input to the ON-pathway  
301 
Besides L1 and L3, the remaining input downstream of photoreceptors is the contrast-sensitive 
302 
L2 neuron, which provides strong inputs to OFF-pathway neurons (Takemura et al., 2013). To 
303 
explore the possibility of L2 also being an ON pathway input, we silenced L2 outputs either 
304 
individually or together with L1. L2-silenced flies showed only slightly reduced turning to all ON 
305 
edges as compared to controls (Figure 5A,B) similarly to silencing L1 alone (Figure 3A,B). 
306 
However, when L1 and L2 were silenced together, fly turning responses were fully disrupted 
307 
across conditions (Figure 5C,D). Moreover, these flies did not turn to other ON contrasts steps 
308 
either (Supp. Figure 2). This shows that L2, together with L1, is required for ON behavioral 
309 
responses across different contrasts and luminances. Altogether, L1, L2 and L3 are all ON-
310 
pathway inputs.

L1 is also an OFF pathway input  
322 
  
323 
Given that three lamina neuron inputs encode visual stimuli differently and that all of them convey 
324 
information to the ON-pathway, we next asked if L1 could also contribute to OFF-pathway 
325 
function. To test this, we silenced L1 neurons while showing moving OFF edges, all of -100% 
326 
contrast, and moving across five different background luminances. Control flies turned similarly 
327 
under all conditions, showing lumiance-invariant responses (Figure 6A). Previous work showed 
328 
that L3 is required to achieve luminance invariance by scaling behavioral responses when 
329 
background luminance turned dark (Ketkar et al., 2020). Similarly, when L1 was silenced, 
330 
behavioral responses were no longer invariant across luminance, but flies turned less to -100% 
331 
contrast at low luminance as compared to high luminance (Figure 6A,B). Underestimation of the 
332 
dim OFF stimuli by L1-silenced flies was not as strong as by L3-silenced flies (Ketkar et al., 2020), 
333 
again highlighting the specialized role of L3 in dim light (Figure 6B). These data demonstrate that 
334 
L1 luminance inputs are required for luminance-invariant OFF behavior. Since L1 carries both 
335 
contrast and luminance information, it could be also sufficient to drive OFF behavior. To test this, 
336 
we measured behavioral responses to OFF edges in L1 ort rescue flies. Heterozygous ort controls

showed turning responses to -100% OFF edges at five different luminances (Figure 6C). As 
338 
described previously (Ketkar et al., 2020), ort null mutants were not completely blind to this OFF-
339 
edge motion stimulus and responded especially at high luminance but very little at low 
340 
luminances. L1 ort rescue flies responded similarly to positive controls, rescuing OFF edges at 
341 
low luminances (Figure 6D). Therefore, L1 is even sufficient to guide OFF behavior under the 
342 
same conditions that were previously described for L3 (Ketkar et al., 2020). Taken together, these 
343 
findings reveal that the lamina neurons L1 and L3 provide behaviorally relevant but differentially 
344 
encoded luminance information to both ON and OFF pathways. In sum, our data uncover L1, L2 
345 
and L3 as important inputs for both ON and the OFF pathways, relevant for visually guided 
346 
behaviors across luminances (Figure 6E).

Discussion 
361 
The present study establishes that contrast and luminance are basic visual features that interact 
362 
with both ON and OFF pathways. In both pathways, the interaction between these features 
363 
enables stable visual behaviors across changing conditions. The lamina neurons L1, L2 and L3 
364 
act as the circuit elements segregating both contrast and luminance information. Behavioral 
365 
experiments show that luminance information is required for contrast constancy in both ON and 
366 
OFF behaviors. While L1 and L3 provide contrast inputs to both ON and OFF pathways, L1 also 
367 
encodes luminance, together with L3. Whereas L3 activity non-linearly increases with decreasing 
368 
luminance, L1 shows a linear relationship with luminance. Luminance information from both 
369 
neurons is differently used in ON and OFF pathways. Thus, L1, L2 and L3 are not ON or OFF 
370 
pathways specific inputs, but they instead distribute the two most basic visual features, contrast 
371 
and luminance, across pathways to enable behaviorally relevant computations. 
372 
 
373 
Contrast constancy is a common feature of ON and OFF visual pathways, but with 
374 
distinct implementations 
375 
Our work shows that visual behaviors guided by both ON and OFF pathways are luminance 
376 
invariant. Similarly, luminance invariance has been shown in human perception of both ON and 
377 
OFF contrasts, and in neural responses in cat LGN (Burkhardt et al., 1984; Mante et al., 2005). 
378 
This argues that luminance invariance is a common feature of all visual systems, which is 
379 
ethologically relevant for any species that relies on visual information for its survival in changing 
380 
visual environments. Changing visual environments impose a common challenge onto the 
381 
encoding of both ON and OFF contrasts, namely the contrasts are underestimated in sudden dim 
382 
light. The L1 contrast-sensitive responses reflect such underestimation. Thus, both ON and OFF 
383 
visual pathways would require a luminance-based correction to achieve luminance invariance, 
384 
and such correction would in turn rely on luminance-sensitive neuronal signals themselves. We 
385 
now confirm this hypothesis for both ON and OFF pathways. Specifically, luminance information 
386 
from both L1 and L3 are required for luminance-invariant visual behaviors. However, the impact 
387 
of the two neurons on behavior is pathway dependent. In the OFF pathway, losing either L1 or L3 
388 
function leads to a strong deviation from luminance invariance, such that the dim light stimuli are 
389 
underestimated. On the contrary, ON motion-driven behavior only strongly deviates from 
390 
invariance if both L1 and L3 neuron types are not functional. Furthermore, L2 neurons, which 
391 
were formerly thought to be OFF pathway inputs, contribute contrast-sensitive information to ON 
392 
behavior (Clark et al., 2011; Joesch et al., 2010; Silies et al., 2013). Notably, ON and OFF contrast 
393 
constancy is not achieved symmetrically at every processing stage. For example, in the vertebrate 
394 
retina, ON RGCs encode a mixture of luminance-invariant and absolute (i.e. luminance-
395 
dependent) contrast, whereas OFF RGCs encode predominantly absolute contrast (Idrees and 
396 
Münch, 2020). Thus, asymmetrical implementation of contrast-corrective mechanisms can be 
397 
common across visual systems, too.

All lamina neurons are inputs to both ON and OFF pathways

L1, L2 and L3 all show different contrast and luminance sensitivities. These distinct neuronal 
401 
properties are then differentially utilized across ON and OFF pathways. How does this fit with the 
402 
established notion that L1 is an input to the ON and L2 and L3 are inputs to OFF pathways? The 
403 
luminance-varying stimuli sets used here were able to pull out lamina neuron contributions that 
404 
were not obvious with simpler stimuli. For example, our data show that L1 and L2 provide 
405 
redundant contrast input to the ON pathway at 100% contrast and varying luminance. However, 
406 
L1 is still strictly required for ON responses if different contrasts are mixed. This is consistent with 
407 
a more complex ON pathway input architecture and hints at a role for the L1 pathway in contrast 
408 
adaptation. Interestingly, Mi1, an important post-synaptic partner of L1, shows an almost 
409 
instantaneous and strong contrast adaptation (Matulis et al., 2020).  
410 
All three lamina neuron types hyperpolarize to light onset and depolarize to light offset and are 
411 
not contrast selective themselves. Contrast selectivity emerges downstream of these neurons: 
412 
known post-synaptic partners of L1 acquire ON contrast selectivity due to inhibitory glutamatergic 
413 
synapses, whereas cholinergic L2 and L3 synapses retain OFF contrast selectivity (Molina-
414 
Obando et al., 2019). While L3 was actually already suggested to be an ON pathway input based 
415 
on connectomics (Borst et al., 2020), other synaptic connections that link L1 to downstream OFF-
416 
selective neurons, and link L2 and to downstream ON-selective neurons still have to be 
417 
investigated in detail. However, it now becomes evident that a split in ON and OFF circuitry only 
418 
truly exists in downstream medulla neurons and direction-selective cells. The luminance and 
419 
contrast features encoded differently in L1, L2 and L3 lamina neurons are shared by both 
420 
pathways. Importantly, the distinct features that are passed on by the specific inputs downstream 
421 
of photoreceptors guide distinct behavioral roles. 
422 
 
423 
L1 and L3 convey luminance information to multiple pathways 
424 
 Behavioral experiments in combination with genetic manipulations show that both L1 and L3 
425 
neurons provide luminance information to to achieve luminance-invariant behaviors. This 
426 
functional data is consistent with anatomical predictions suggesting a role for L3 in the ON 
427 
pathway based on synaptic contacts with ON-selective neurons (Takemura et al., 2013). L3 had 
428 
mostly been considered an OFF pathway neuron because the OFF pathway neuron Tm9 receives 
429 
its strongest input from L3 (Fisher et al., 2015; Shinomiya et al., 2014; Takemura et al., 2013). 
430 
Remarkably, L3 itself actually makes most synaptic connections with the ON-pathway neuron 
431 
Mi9. Further synapses of L3 with the ON-selective Mi1 neuron are similar in number to those with 
432 
Tm9 (Takemura et al., 2013). Finally, L3 can potentially also convey information to the chromatic 
433 
pathway, as Tm20 is its second strongest postsynaptic connection (Lin et al., 2016). There, L3 
434 
luminance sensitivity might play a relevant role in achieving color constancy, i.e., color recognition 
435 
irrespective of illumination conditions. Altogether, anatomical and functional data indicate that it 
436 
is time to redefine L3 as part of a luminance-encoding system rather than a mere OFF-pathway 
437 
input.  
438 
A role of L1 beyond the ON pathway was less obvious based on anatomical data but is supported 
439 
by functional connectivity studies showing that Tm9 properties rely in part on L1 input (Fisher et 
440 
al., 2015), and that Tm9 together with other OFF pathway interneurons displays contrast-
441 
opponent receptive fields, adding evidence to the presence of ON information in the OFF pathway 
442 
(Ramos-Traslosheros and Silies, 2021). Connectomics data did not identify any known OFF-

pathway neurons postsynaptic to L1 and presynaptic to the OFF-motion selective neuron T5 
444 
(Takemura et al., 2013). L1 must therefore connect to the OFF pathway via interneurons. Among 
445 
the strongest postsynaptic partners of L1 are the GABAergic interneurons C2 and C3 that connect 
446 
to the OFF pathway (Takemura et al., 2013). Intercolumnar neurons downstream of L1, such as 
447 
Dm neurons (Nern et al., 2015), could further carry information to OFF-selective neurons, likely 
448 
through disinhibition from ON-selective inputs. In the vertebrate retina, intercolumnar amacrine 
449 
cells mediate interaction between ON and OFF bipolar cells, which has been shown to extend the 
450 
operating range of the OFF pathway (Manookin et al., 2008; Odermatt et al., 2012). Altogether, 
451 
strategies appear to be shared across animals in which type of interneurons help to convey 
452 
relevant features from one pathway to the other.  
453 
 
454 
Neurons postsynaptic to photoreceptors encode contrast and luminance differently   
455 
Despite being postsynaptic to the same photoreceptor input, all lamina neurons respond 
456 
differently to light stimuli. L1 was previously considered the ON pathway sibling of the contrast-
457 
sensitive L2, both with regard to its temporal filtering properties and at the transcriptome level 
458 
(Clark et al., 2011; Tan et al., 2015). However, L1 calcium signals show a transient and a 
459 
sustained response component, which are contrast- and luminance-sensitive, respectively. 
460 
Compared to photoreceptors, which also carry both contrast and luminance components, L1 still 
461 
amplifies the contrast signals received from the photoreceptors, since its transient component is 
462 
more pronounced than the one seen in the photoreceptor calcium traces (Gür et al., 2020). In 
463 
other insect species, different types of lamina neurons have also been distinguished based on 
464 
their physiological properties (Rusanen et al., 2018, 2017), although their specific luminance and 
465 
contrast sensitivities are yet unknown.  
466 
The two luminance-sensitive neurons L1 and L3 differ in their luminance-encoding properties. 
467 
L1’s initial transient contrast response might reduce the operating range of the subsequent 
468 
luminance-sensitive baseline. L3’s calcium responses show little adaptation and can utilize most 
469 
of its operating range to encode luminance. L3 seems to invest this wider operating range into 
470 
amplifying the darkest luminance values selectively and non-linearly. Thus, a predominantly 
471 
luminance-sensitive channel among LMCs may have evolved to selectively process stimuli in the 
472 
low luminance range. The different linear and non-linear properties of L1 and L3 might further 
473 
increase the dynamic range of luminance signaling (Odermatt et al., 2012). Together with the 
474 
pure contrast sensitivity of L2, the first-order interneurons in flies exhibit a wide range of 
475 
sensitivities with respect to contrast and luminance, and our data confirm the functional relevance 
476 
of the differential sensitivities. Diversifying feature encoding through distinct temporal properties 
477 
of first-order interneurons is a strategy employed to reliably handle wide luminance ranges. 
478 
 
479 
Similarities and differences of peripheral processing strategies across species 
480 
In flies, three first-order interneurons feed contrast and luminance information into downstream 
481 
circuitry. In the mouse retina, more than 30 functionally distinct bipolar types show a spectrum of 
482 
temporal filter properties rather than a strict transient-sustained dichotomy, thus capturing a larger 
483 
diversity of temporal information in parallel channels (e.g., (Baden et al., 2016; Ichinose et al.,

luminance and contrast signals in distinct response components (e.g., (Oesch and Diamond, 
486 
2011)). However, the degree of transiency varies from cell type to cell type, and some 
487 
predominantly sustained bipolar cell types are also found, closely resembling the luminance-
488 
sensitive L3 (e.g., (Awatramani and Slaughter, 2000; Ichinose et al., 2014)). Such diversification 
489 
of feature extraction at the periphery has been shown to be computationally advantageous, 
490 
especially when processing complex natural scenes (e.g. (Odermatt et al., 2012; Rieke and Rudd, 
491 
2009)). For example, during daylight, visual scenes can differ in intensity by 4 to 5 log units, 
492 
whereas electrical signals in cone photoreceptors reach a dynamic range of only two orders of 
493 
magnitude (Naka and Rushton, 1966; Normann and Perlman, 1979; Pouli et al., 2010; Schnapf 
494 
et al., 1990).  
495 
Although the vertebrate retina apparently has a much larger diversity of cell types to handle the 
496 
wide and complex statistics of the visual environments, there is only a single layer of processing 
497 
between photoreceptors and the first direction-selective cells, whereas in insects, there are two: 
498 
the lamina and the medulla. It seems as if the combined properties of bipolar cells are spread 
499 
across these two processing stages in the fly visual system: whereas some properties, such as 
500 
diversity of temporal filtering starts in LMCs, contrast selectivity only emerges in medulla neurons 
501 
and not directly in the first-order interneurons as it happens in bipolar cells. In both vertebrates 
502 
and invertebrates, the emergence of ON selectivity occurs through inhibitory glutamatergic 
503 
synapses, but whereas this happens at the photoreceptor-to-bipolar cell synapse in vertebrates, 
504 
it happens one synapse further down between lamina and medulla neurons in flies (Masu et al., 
505 
1995; Molina-Obando et al., 2019). Taken together, LMCs and downstream medulla neurons 
506 
combined appear to be the functional equivalents of vertebrate bipolar cell layers. Given the size 
507 
limitations of the fly visual system to encode the same complex environment effectively, one 
508 
benefit of this configuration with an extra layer could be that it allows more combinations. 
509 
Furthermore, the photoreceptor-to-lamina synapse in the fly superposition eye already serves to 
510 
spatially pool information from different photoreceptors (Braitenberg, 1967; Clandinin and 
511 
Zipursky, 2002; Kirschfeld, 1967). In both visual systems, diversifying distinct information across 
512 
several neurons could serve as a strategy to reliably respond to contrast when luminance 
513 
conditions vary.

Methods 
516 
  
517 
Experimental model 
518 
All flies were raised at 25 ºC and 65 % humidity on standard molasses-based fly food while being 
519 
subjected to a 12:12h light-dark cycle. Two-photon experiments were conducted at room 
520 
temperature (20 ºC) and behavioral experiments at 34 ºC. Female flies 2-4 days after eclosion 
521 
were used for all experimental purposes. Lamina neuron driver lines used for genetic silencing 
522 
and ort rescue experiments were L30595-Gal4 (Silies et al., 2013), L221Dhh-Gal4 and L1C202a-Gal4 
523 
(Rister et al., 2007), and UAS-shi[ts], ort1,ninaE1 and Df(3R)BSC809 were from BDSC (# 44222, 
524 
1946 and 27380). Since the ort1 mutant chromosomes also carries a mutation in ninaE1 
525 
(Drosophila rhodopsin1), we used the ort1 mutation in trans to a deficiency that uncovers the ort 
526 
but not the ninaE locus. UAS-ort was first described in (Hong et al., 2006). For imaging 
527 
experiments, GCaMP6f (BDSC #42747) was expressed using L1c202a-Gal4, L221Dhh-Gal4 (Rister 
528 
et al., 2007), and L3MH56-Gal4 (Timofeev et al., 2012). Detailed genotypes are given in Table 1.

Behavioral experiments 
532 
Behavioral experiments were performed as described in (Ketkar et al., 2020). In brief, all 
533 
experiments were conducted at 34 ºC, a restrictive temperature for shibirets (Kitamoto, 2001). 
534 
Female flies were cold anesthetized and glued to the tip of a needle at their thorax using UV-
535 
hardened Norland optical adhesive. A 3D micromanipulator positioned the fly above an air-
536 
cushioned polyurethane ball (Kugel-Winnie, Bamberg, Germany), 6 mm in diameter, and located 
537 
at the center of a cylindrical LED arena that spanned 192º in azimuth and 80º in elevation (Reiser 
538 
and Dickinson, 2008). The LED panels arena (IO Rodeo, CA, USA) consisted of 570 nm LEDs 
539 
and was enclosed in a dark chamber. The pixel resolution was ~2º at the fly’s elevation. Rotation 
540 
of the ball was sampled at 120 Hz with two wireless optical sensors (Logitech Anywhere MX 1, 
541 
Lausanne, Switzerland), positioned toward the center of the ball and at 90º to each other (setup 
542 
described in (Seelig et al., 2010). Custom written C#-code was used to acquire ball movement 
543 
data. MATLAB (Mathworks, MA, USA) was used to coordinate stimulus presentation and data 
544 
acquisition. Data for each stimulus sequence were acquired for 15-20 minutes, depending on the 
545 
number of distinct epochs in the sequence (see ‘visual stimulation’ for details). 
546 
  
547 
Visual stimulation for behavior 
548 
The stimulation panels consist of green LEDs that can show 16 different, linearly spaced intensity 
549 
levels. To measure the presented luminance, candela/m2 values were first measured from the 
550 
position of the fly using a LS-100 luminance meter (Konika Minolta, NJ, USA). Then, these values 
551 
were transformed to photons incidence per photoreceptor per second, following the procedure 
552 
described by (Dubs et al., 1981). The highest native LED luminance was approximately 11.77 * 
553 
105 photons * s-1 * photoreceptor-1 (corresponding to a measured luminance of 51.34 cd/m2), and 
554 
the luminance meter read 0 candela/ m2 when all LEDs were off. For all experiments, a 0.9 neutral

density filter foil (Lee filters) was placed in front of the panels, such that the highest LED level 
556 
corresponded to 14.71 *104 photons*s-1*receptor-1. 
557 
Fly behavior was measured in an open-loop paradigm where either ON or OFF edges were 
558 
presented. For every set of ON or OFF edges, each epoch was presented for around 60 to 80 
559 
trials. Each trial consisted of an initial static pattern (i.e., the first frame of the upcoming pattern) 
560 
shown for 500 ms followed by 750 ms of edge motion. Inter-trial intervals were 1s. All edges from 
561 
a set were randomly interleaved and presented in a mirror-symmetric fashion (moving to the right, 
562 
or to the left) to account for potential biases in individual flies or introduced when positioning on 
563 
the ball. 
564 
The ON edge stimuli comprised four edges, each covering 48º arena space. All ON edges moved 
565 
with the angular speed of 160º/s. Thus, within a 750 ms stimulus epoch, the edge motion repeated 
566 
thrice: After each repetition, the now bright arena was reset to the pre-motion lower LED level, 
567 
and the next repetition followed immediately, picking up from the positions where the edges 
568 
terminated in the first repetition. This way, each edge virtually moved continuously. The following 
569 
sets of ON edges were presented: 
570 
1. 100% contrast edges: Here, the edges were made of 5 different luminance values (i.e. five 
571 
unique epochs), moving on a complete dark background. Thus, the pre-motion LED level was 
572 
zero, and the edges assumed the intensities 7%, 14%, 27%, 53% or 100% of the highest LED 
573 
intensity (corresponding to the luminances: 0.98, 1.96, 3.92, 7.84 or 14.71 *104 photons*s-
574 
1*receptor-1 luminance). Thus, every epoch comprised 100% Michelson contrast. The inter-
575 
trial interval consisted of a dark screen. 
576 
2. Mixed-contrast edges – full range: The set comprised of seven distinct epochs, each with a 
577 
different Michelson contrast value (11%, 25%, 33%, 43%, 67%, 82% and 100%). Here, the 
578 
edge luminance was maintained constant at 67% of the highest LED intensity, across epochs, 
579 
and the background luminance varied. The inter-trial interval showed a uniformly lit screen 
580 
with luminance equivalent to the edge luminance. 
581 
3. Mixed-contrast edges – low contrast range: The set comprised of four distinct epochs, with 
582 
contrasts from the range 9%, 18%, 27% and 36%. Here, edge luminances and background 
583 
luminances both varied: The edge luminances assumed the intensities 80%, 87%, 93% and 
584 
100% of the highest LED intensity, whereas the background intensities were 67%, 60%, 53% 
585 
and 47% of the highest LED intensity, respectively. The inter-trial interval consisted of a dark 
586 
screen. 
587 
 
588 
For the experiments concerning OFF edges, a set of five OFF edges comprising 100% Weber 
589 
contrast was used as described in (Ketkar et al., 2020). Epoch consisted of a single OFF edge 
590 
presented at one of five different uniformly lit backgrounds. The edge luminance was always 
591 
~zero, whereas the five different background luminances were 7%, 14%, 27%, 54% and 100% of 
592 
the highest LED intensity (corresponding to five different background luminances: 0.98, 1.96, 
593 
3.92, 7.84 or 14.71 *104 photons*s-1*receptor-1). The inter-trial interval consisted of a dark screen.

Behavioral data analysis 
597 
Fly turning behavior was defined as yaw velocities that were derived as described in (Seelig et 
598 
al., 2010), leading to a positive turn when flies turned in the direction of the stimulation and to a 
599 
negative turn in the opposite case. Turning elicited by the same epoch moving either to the right 
600 
or to the left were aggregated to compute the mean response of the fly to that epoch. Turning 
601 
responses are presented as angular velocities (rad/s) averaged across flies ± SEM. Peak 
602 
velocities were calculated over the stimulus motion period (750ms), shifted by 100 ms to account 
603 
for a response delay, and relative to a baseline defined as the last 200 ms of the preceding inter-
604 
stimulus intervals. For the moving edges of 100% contrast and varying luminance, relation 
605 
between peak velocities and luminance was assessed by fitting a straight line (V = 
606 
a*log(luminance) + b) to the peak velocities of individual flies and quantifying the mean slope (a) 
607 
± SEM across flies. When comparing the slopes computed for behavior and L1 physiology, the 
608 
two data types were first normalized for individual flies for behavior and individual regions of 
609 
interest (ROIs) for L1 physiology (Figure 1E). For the ort rescue experiments, rescue efficiency 
610 
was calculated at each stimulus luminance as 
611 
𝐸!"#$%" = 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑐𝑢𝑒−𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙&
𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙' −𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙& 
612 
where Erescue is the fractional rescue efficiency, rescue is the mean peak velocity of the rescue 
613 
genotype such as L1 rescue, control- is the mean peak velocity of the ort null mutant negative 
614 
control and control+ stands for the mean peak velocity of the positive heterozygous ort1 control 
615 
(e.g., L1-Gal4; ort1/+). Statistical significance of Erescue differences was tested using a permutation 
616 
test. Specifically, flies of the genotypes L1 ort rescue and L3 ort rescue were shuffled 1000 times 
617 
and the difference between their rescue efficiencies was obtained each time. The difference 
618 
values so obtained gave a probability distribution that approximated a normal distribution. The 
619 
efficiency difference was considered significant when it corresponded to less than 5% probability 
620 
on both tails of the distribution. 
621 
Mean turning of flies as well as the slopes from control and experimental genotypes were normal 
622 
distributed as tested using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (p > 0.05). Two-tailed Student’s t tests and 
623 
Bonferroni-Holm correction were performed between genotypes. Data points were considered 
624 
significantly different only when the experimental group significantly differed from both genetic 
625 
controls. Flies with a baseline forward walking speed of less than 2 mm/s were discarded from 
626 
the analysis. This resulted in rejection of approximately 25% of all flies. 
627 
  
628 
Two-photon imaging 
629 
Female flies were anesthetized on ice before placing them onto a sheet of stainless-steel foil 
630 
bearing a hole that fit the thorax and head of the flies. Flies they were head fixated using UV-
631 
sensitive glue (Bondic). The head of the fly was tilted downward, looking toward the stimulation 
632 
screen and their back of the head was exposed to the microscope objective. To optically access 
633 
the optic lobe, a small window was cut in the cuticle on the back of the head using sharp forceps. 
634 
During imaging, the brain was perfused with a carboxygenated saline-sugar imaging solution 
635 
composed of 103 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 5 mM TES, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 4 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM

CaCl2,10 mM trehalose, 10 mM glucose, 7 mM sucrose, and 26 mM NaHCO3. Dissections were 
637 
done in the same solution, but lacking calcium and sugars. The pH of the saline equilibrated near 
638 
7.3 when bubbled with 95% O2 / 5% CO2. The two-photon experiments for Figure 2 were 
639 
performed using a Bruker Investigator microscope (Bruker, Madison,WI, USA), equipped with a 
640 
25x/NA1.1 objective (Nikon, Minato, Japan). An excitation laser (Spectraphysics Insight DS+) 
641 
tuned to 920 nm was used to excite GCaMP6f, applying 5-15 mW of power at the sample. For 
642 
experiments in Figure 1, a Bruker Ultima microscope, equipped with a 20x/NA1.0 objective (Leica, 
643 
Jerusalem, Israel) was used. Here the excitation laser (YLMO-930 Menlo Systems, Martinsried, 
644 
Germany) had a fixed 930 nm wavelength, and a power of 5-15 mW was applied at the sample. 
645 
In both setups, emitted light was sent through a SP680 shortpass filter, a 560 lpxr dichroic filter 
646 
and a 525/70 emission filter. Data was acquired at a frame rate of ~10 to 15Hz and around 6–8x 
647 
optical zoom, using PrairieView software. 
648 
 
649 
Visual stimulation for imaging 
650 
For the staircase stimuli and light flashes of different luminances, the visual stimuli were 
651 
generated by custom-written software using C++ and OpenGL and projected onto an 8cm x 8cm 
652 
rear projection screen placed anterior to the fly and covering 60º of the fly’s visual system in 
653 
azimuth and 60º in elevation. These experiments were performed with the Bruker Investigator 
654 
microscope. 
655 
For ON-moving edges, the stimulus was generated by custom-written software using the Python 
656 
package PsychoPy (Peirce, 2008), and then projected onto a 9cm x 9cm rear projection screen 
657 
placed anterior to the fly at a 45º angle and covering 80º of the fly’s visual system in azimuth and 
658 
80º in elevation. These experiments were performed with the Bruker Ultima microscope. 
659 
Both stimuli were projected using a LightCrafter (Texas Instruments, Dallas, TX, USA), updating 
660 
stimuli at a frame rate of 100 Hz. Before reaching the fly eye, stimuli were filtered by a 482/18 
661 
band pass filter and a ND1.0 neutral density filter (Thorlabs). The luminance values are measured 
662 
using the same procedure described above for the behavioral experiments. The maximum 
663 
luminance value measured at the fly position was 2.17*105 photons s-1 photoreceptor-1 for the 
664 
staircase and random luminance stimulation, and 2.4*105 photons s-1 photoreceptor-1 for the ON-
665 
moving edge stimulation. The imaging and the visual stimulus presentation were synchronized as 
666 
described previously (Freifeld et al., 2013). 
667 
  
668 
Staircase stimulation 
669 
The stimulus consisted of 10s full-field flashes of 5 different luminances (0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 
670 
1∗ of the maximal luminance Imax). The different luminance epochs were presented first in an 
671 
increasing order (from darkness to full brightness) then in a decreasing order (full brightness to 
672 
darkness). This sequence was repeated ~3-5 times.

The stimulus consisted of 10s full-field flashes of 5 different luminances (0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 
676 
1∗ of the maximal luminance Imax). The order between the flashes was pseudo-randomized and 
677 
the stimulus sequence was presented for ~300s. 
678 
 
679 
ON moving edges at different luminances 
680 
Here, the edges were made of 6 different luminance values (corresponding to 0.16, 0.31, 0.62, 
681 
1.2, 1.8, 2.4 *105 photons*s-1*receptor-1 luminance), moving on a dark background. The inter-
682 
stimulus interval was 4 seconds of darkness. 
683 
  
684 
Two photon data analysis 
685 
Staircase stimulation and randomized flashes of different luminances 
686 
Data processing was performed offline using MATLAB R2019a (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA). 
687 
To correct for motion artifacts, individual images were aligned to a reference image composed of 
688 
a maximum intensity projection of the first 30 frames. The average intensity for manually selected 
689 
ROIs was computed for each imaging frame and background subtracted to generate a time trace 
690 
of the response. All responses and visual stimuli were interpolated at 10 Hz and trial averaged. 
691 
Neural responses are shown as relative fluorescence intensity changes over time (ΔF/F0). To 
692 
calculate ΔF/F0, the mean of the whole trace was used as F0. In some recordings, a minority of 
693 
ROIs responded in opposite polarity (positively correlated with stimulus), as described previously 
694 
(Fisher et al., 2015). These ROIs have their receptive fields outside the stimulation screen (Fisher 
695 
et al., 2015; Freifeld et al., 2013). To discard these and other noisy ROIs, we only used ROIs that 
696 
were negatively correlated (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient) with the stimulus. Plateau 
697 
responses were calculated as the mean of the last 2 seconds within each luminance presentation. 
698 
In the randomized flashes of different luminances, plateau response values of the highest 
699 
luminance epoch were subtracted for each plateau response to get a comparable relationship 
700 
between each neuron for visualization (this leads to 0 plateau response for each neuron in the 
701 
highest luminance condition). Mutual information between luminance and response was 
702 
calculated according to (Ross, 2014). To characterize the distinct luminance-response 
703 
relationships of L1 and L3, the difference of Pearson correlation and Spearman’s rank correlation 
704 
was used as a Non-linearity index. This value will reach zero if there is a strict linear relationship 
705 
between luminance and response.

707 
ON moving edges at different luminances 
708 
Data processing was performed offline using Python 2.7 (Van Rossum 1995). Motion correction 
709 
was performed using the SIMA Python package’s Hidden Markov Model based motion correction 
710 
algorithm (Kaifosh et al., 2014). The average intensity for manually selected ROIs was computed 
711 
for each imaging frame and background subtracted to generate a time trace of the response. To 
712 
calculate ΔF/F0, the mean of the whole trace was used as F0. The traces were then trial averaged. 
713 
Responses of ROIs for each epoch was calculated as the absolute difference between the mean

of the full darkness background epoch and the minimum of the ON edge presentation (minimum 
715 
values are chosen because L1 neurons respond to ON stimuli with hyperpolarization).

717 
Statistics  
718 
Throughout the analysis procedure, mean of quantified variables were calculated first for all ROIs 
719 
within a fly, and then between flies. All statistical analysis was performed between flies. For 
720 
normally distributed data sets, a two-tailed Student t test for unpaired (independent) samples was 
721 
used. For other data sets, Wilcoxon rank-sum was used for statistical analysis. Normality was 
722 
tested using Lilliefors test (p>0.05). One way ANOVA was used followed by multiple comparisons 
723 
using the Bonferroni method for determining statistical significance between pairs of groups.

Figure S1: L1 is required for ON behavior across a range of contrasts. (A) Turning responses of the controls 
(gray) and L1-silenced flies (orange) in response to the moving ON edges of different contrasts, ranging from 11% 
to 100%. (B) Peak turning velocities quantified during the motion period, *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, two-
tailed Student’s t tests against both controls. Sample sizes are n = 9 (UAS-shits/+, L1c202a >>shits) and n = 5 (L1c202a-
Gal4/+). (C) Turning velocity time traces of the controls and L3-silenced flies in response to the moving ON edges 
of different contrasts, ranging from 9% to 36%. (D) Peak turning velocities quantified during the motion period, *p < 
0.05, two-tailed Student’s t tests against both controls. Sample sizes are n = 8 (UAS-shits/+), n = 8 (L1c202a >>shits) 
and n = 5 (L1c202a -Gal4/+). Traces and plots show mean ± SEM. The gray box region in (A) and (C) indicates motion 
duration.

Figure S2: L1 and L2 together are required for ON behavior across a range of contrasts. (A) Turning velocity 
time traces of the Gal4 control (gray) and L2-silenced flies (purple) in response to the moving ON edges of different 
contrasts, ranging from 11% to 100%. (B) Peak turning velocities quantified during the motion period. Sample sizes 
are n = 9 (UAS-shits/+), n = 8 (L221Dhh >>shits) and n = 8 (L221Dhh-Gal4/+). (C) Turning velocity time traces of the Gal4 
control and L1,L2-silenced flies (brown) in response to the moving ON edges of different contrasts, ranging from 
11% to 100%. (D) Peak turning velocities quantified during the motion period, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, 
two-tailed Student’s t tests against both controls. Sample sizes are n = 9 (UAS-shits/+),n = 8 (L1,L2 >>shits) and n =
