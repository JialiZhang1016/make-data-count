Abstract
This study evaluated the potential of
producing
supplementary
cementitious
materials
(SCMs) using London Clay excavated from construc-
tion activities of the High Speed 2 rail project. A trade-
off between enhancing reactivity versus decomposi-
tion of impurities (e.g., pyrite, carbonates) present in
different London Clay samples was considered in
selecting the calcination temperature. The additional
reactivity obtained by calcining at 800 C is deemed to
be worth the cost of the small additional process
emissions from decomposition of carbonate minerals.
Blended cement formulations were developed with the
produced SCMs, with replacement levels of 50 and 70
wt%. The optimal gypsum dosage was found to be 1
wt%, which resulted in improved reaction kinetics at
early ages. Mortars produced with these binders
developed *50 MPa compressive strength after 90
days of curing even with 70 wt% replacement, which
is sufﬁcient for potential production of low to medium
strength concretes. These ﬁndings demonstrate the
excellent potential of London Clays for SCM produc-
tion and present a systematic approach for character-
isation, processing and utilization of excavated mixed
clays obtained from infrastructure projects.

1 Introduction
The construction industry faces many challenges to
reduce its environmental impacts, including reducing
the volume of construction waste, and particularly the
volume of waste sent to landﬁll. In Europe, excavated
soils are the largest stream of construction waste,
estimated to be \ 500 MT/year [1]. In the UK, there is
a target to reduce excavation soil sent to landﬁll by
75% by 2040, and zero soil to landﬁll by 2050 [2].
Whilst some of this material can be reused for
geotechnical activities elsewhere on site, transporta-
tion of excavated soil to landﬁll is still a common
practice [3]. Volumes of excavated material are
particularly large for major infrastructure projects

involving tunnelling—hundreds of megatonnes of
excavated material are forecast to be generated over
the next 50 years [4]. Where excavation is carried out
in urban areas, transport of excavated soil out of the
site can add disruption to local residents. The overall
management of excavated soil can be improved by
increasing their use in construction materials [5].
Another challenge is to reduce the embodied carbon
of construction, with particular scrutiny on concrete.
In the UK, the Low Carbon Concrete Group roadmap
targets net zero emissions from concrete production by
2050, with at least a 50% reduction to be achieved by
2030 [6]. One of the fastest ways to decrease the
carbon footprint of cement is to decrease the clinker
content with higher substitutions of supplementary
cementitious materials (SCMs) [7]. Blast furnace slag
and ﬂy ash remain the most commonly used SCMs in
the UK. However, falling domestic supply and an
increased reliance on imports are expected to reduce
supply chain resilience and increase prices in the
coming years [8]. The use of calcined clay in binary
and ternary forms (with limestone) has the potential to
reduce the CO2 footprint of cementitious materials
between 30 and 50% compared to Portland clinker
[9–11]. Therefore, calcined clays produced from clays
with low purity and/or mixed clay mineralogy are
increasingly being explored as an alternative to
conventional SCMs. However, their variation in purity
and mineralogy raises questions around selection of
calcination conditions to promote optimum reactivity,
how the properties of such calcined clays might
inﬂuence fresh, mechanical or long-term performance
of concretes produced with them, compared with
materials produced with other SCMs.
The use of excavated clayed soils as a SCM offers
an opportunity for the construction industry to address
the mentioned challenges simultaneously. Design of
mobile calcining plants for clays or soils has been
proposed [12, 13]. However, an integrated calcining,
grinding and blending plant on-site has not yet been
implemented on any major construction operations.
An innovative mobile clay processing facility is
currently under development as part of a major
infrastructure project in the UK [14]. This set-up
would have numerous beneﬁts in principle, including
reducing the volume of excavated material sent to
landﬁll; improving the functional value of soils,
relative to use in groundworks or landﬁll; reducing
the ﬂow of materials entering and leaving the
construction site, and reducing the impact of truck
trafﬁc on the neighbourhood. There is increasing
research interest in adopting resource recovery prin-
ciples in the construction lifecycle in order to reduce
environmental impacts [15]; however, excavated clays
have received little attention so far.
Several routes for valorisation for excavation waste
have been investigated, which include the developed
of supplementary cementitious materials [16–18], as
ﬁne aggregates [5, 19], for development of earth-based
materials [20, 21], as precursors of alkali-activated
cements production [22] and as raw feeds for calcium
sulfoaluminate (CSA) cements production or as CSA
replacements [23, 24]. Wherever possible, excavation
wastes should be used as raw material in earth
construction due to the low embodied carbon of the
process, however, experience has shown that excava-
tion management is a common problem in major
infrastructure projects, particularly in densely popu-
lated areas, e.g., an artiﬁcial island was created from
waste from a past major infrastructure [25].
This study investigated the feasibility of producing
SCMs using excavated material from ongoing tun-
nelling works in the Greater London region, whilst the
excavated material predominately consists of London
Clay formation. These works are linked to the ﬁrst part
of High Speed 2 (HS2, https://www.hs2.org.uk), a
major rail infrastructure project in the UK [26] and it is
estimated that over 5 million m3 of material will be
excavated—the majority of this is expected to be
London Clay [16].
London Clay is the name given to the type of clays
found in the London Basin geological formation. They
are mixed, or common, clays—their clay mineral
assemblage typically consists of smectite, illite,
kaolinite and chlorite [27]. This diversity within the
clay mineral fraction makes London Clays mineralog-
ically distinct from kaolinitic clays, which have
received most attention within the ﬁeld of calcined
clays as SCMs. Crucially, their kaolinite content is
relatively low—broadly within the range of 10–30
wt% [27]. This is believed to be disadvantageous from
an SCM production perspective, as 40 wt% of
kaolinite content has previously been established as
the optimal amount required [28, 29] to produce
blended cements with equivalent strength develop-
ment by 7 days to that of Portland cement systems.
However, the extent to which the other, less reactive
clay minerals typically present in London Clays (i.e.
174
Page 2 of 21
Materials and Structures (2023) 56:174
smectite, illite, chlorite) may contribute to reactivity is
still an open research question.
Non-kaolinitic clay minerals are also known to
exhibit pozzolanic reactivity once calcined, however,
they are typically less reactive than metakaolin
[30–33]. Recent work on common clays from Ger-
many determined that smectite and interstratiﬁed
illite–smectite make a tangible contribution to overall
reactivity [34]. The only peer-reviewed study so far
speciﬁcally on the use of London Clays as SCMs
found that calcination at 900 C for 2 h gave the best
reactivity performance at 14 days and beyond, as
measured by the Frattini test, portlandite consumption
measurements and strength activity index; however,
these ﬁndings are related to clays calcined in 5 cm
diameter pellets in laboratory scale. Concretes with 30
wt% replacement using London Clay calcined at
900 C developed sufﬁcient workability (i.e., Slump
class 2, 50–90 mm slump) and a satisfactory perfor-
mance in terms of 90-day compressive strength [18].
Another study on clays with \ 20 wt% kaolinite
content from a variety of UK geological formations
(but not including the London Clay formation)
deemed them to be promising as potential SCMs
[35]. Whilst the small amount of literature on the use
of London Clays as SCMs shows promise, more
research is needed in order to gain a comprehensive
understanding of the links between mineralogy, cal-
cination conditions, and performance in cementitious
systems.
Beyond the role of the clay minerals, the associated
minerals typically found in London clays also present
challenges including ensuring that sulphur-bearing
phases (e.g. pyrite) in the as-received material do not
pose a durability threat after calcination, and ensuring
that carbonate minerals (e.g. calcite, dolomite) do not
decompose to form problematic amounts of expansive
phases (e.g. free lime, periclase). Free lime and MgO
are also known to cause expansion due to crystalliza-
tion of calcium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide
[36, 37]. Provided that calcination conditions are
sufﬁcient to cause complete thermal decomposition of
iron sulphide phases, then their presence in an as-
received clay is not problematic [38]. Aside from
associated minerals, it is feasible that remnants of
polymer foams used for facilitating excavation may be
present in excavated material. It is important to assess
the calcined excavated materials to ensure that no such
materials remain which might have a detrimental
effect on use in concrete.
In this study three different sample locations of
excavated London Clay were investigated. These
materials were selected to indicate the extent of
variability of the spoils being generated from HS2
excavation works in the Greater London area. Detailed
characterisation of the clayed soils was conducted
using a multi-technique approach including X-ray
ﬂuorescence spectroscopy (XRF), quantitative X-ray
diffractometry (XRD) and thermogravimetry analysis
coupled with mass spectrometry (TG-MS). Different
calcination conditions were applied to these materials
in order to enhance their chemical reactivity, which
was determined by the R3 testing method. Changes in
the mineralogy and structure of the excavated mate-
rials upon thermal treatment were evaluated applying
similar techniques to those used for characterising the
raw clays.
Blended Portland paste mixes were optimised
(gypsum adjustment) and produced with high replace-
ment levels (50 and 70 wt%) using selected calcined
clays. The kinetics of reaction of these mixes were
determined using isothermal calorimetry. Compres-
sive strength testing in mortars specimens was also
conducted.
2 Materials and methods
2.1 Materials
Samples of excavated materials were sourced from
three different HS2 construction sites, within the
Greater London area (Fig. 1). All sites fell within an
area with a radius of 6 km. The extraction depths were
11 m for the Westgate site, 23 m for the Euston site,
and between 3 and 30 m depth for the Victoria site.
Chemical analysis of the raw clays was conducted
using X-ray ﬂuoresce (XRF) spectroscopy, carried out
with a Rigaku ZSX Primus II, using a fused bead
preparation method and a loss on ignition (LOI) step at
900 C. The chemical oxide compositions (deter-
mined by XRF) of the raw clays were broadly similar
(Table 1). Differences in Al2O3 and CaO indicated
potential small differences in quantities of clay
minerals and carbonates.

(from Cementos Alfa) and laboratory-grade gypsum
(Calcium sulfate dihydrate, 99%, Alfa Aesar) were
used. Visocrete 600 MK (from SIKA Ltd.) was used as
a superplasticiser to increase ﬂuidity of the mortars
prepared with blends.
2.2 Methods
2.2.1 Processing and calcination
Before describing the detailed steps of processing and
calcination, a brief clariﬁcation of terminology will be
given. Hereon, ‘‘as-received clay’’ is used to refer to
the extracted material, before initial drying; ‘‘raw
clay’’ is used to refer to the clay after being air-dryed,
crushed and homogenised; ‘‘calcined clay’’ is used to
refer to the clay after being calcined in a laboratory
furnace and ground in a laboratory ball mil, and
‘‘industrially calcined clay’’ is used to refer to the clay
after being calcined in a pilot scale rotary kiln and and
an industrial ball mill.
The as-received clay was manually broken into
small pieces, and then dried out in shallow trays in
40 C oven for 24 h to reach an ‘air dry state’ in line
with BS 1377-1:2016 [39]. This was necessary to
allow the as-received material to be crushed and
homogenised. Moisture content was measured accord-
ing to BS 1377-2:1990 [40], with three samples
of [ 30 g of material taken from different locations in
the as-received clay, and dried at 105 C for 24 h.
Moisture content calculated from mass loss was then
expressed as a percentage of the dry clay mass.
Whilst most focus of the embodied carbon of
calcined clays is on the heating required for the
calcination step, the moisture content of clays has a
substantial inﬂuence on the energy required for drying
before calcination [41]. Moisture content is expressed
as a percentage of the dry clay mass in the soil and the
results varied between 20 and 45%, as summarised in
Supplementary Information (Table S1). These values
showed substantial variation in moisture content
between the different clay sources. While it is not

viable to conduct a cradle-to-gate analysis of embod-
ied carbon, given the hypothetical nature of the
processing set-up, these ﬁndings demonstrate that
whilst the overall mineralogy between the clays did
not vary greatly, differences in ground conditions
could result in different energy demands for drying
excavated material from different sources. It is also
worth noting that apart from the ground conditions, the
moisture content of soils/clays could be inﬂuenced by
their storage conditions after excavation (i.e. exposure
to rainfall), or even by drilling agents (e.g. polymer
foams used to facilitate excavations).
The ‘air dry’ material was then passed through a
jaw crusher (Retsch BB200) until all material passed
through a 10 mm sieve. This 10 mm upper size limit
was based on recommended feed size for a rotary kiln,
to align the laboratory process with the industrial
process as far as feasible. A rifﬂe box was then used to
homogenise and obtain representative samples of
material from the whole. For generating ﬁnely pow-
dered material for characterisation, a small sample
of * 1 wt% of the whole was taken, and wet-ground
in isopropanol until \ 125 lm.
Clays were calcined in a laboratory static furnace
(Carbolite AAF 1100), using a dwell time at peak
temperature for about 1 h, and a temperature of either
700 or 800 C. These temperatures were selected
based on the range of dehydroxylation temperatures
identiﬁed
via
thermogravimetric
analysis
[42]
(Sect. 3.1). Clays were loaded in shallow porcelain
crucibles. After calcination, the clay was then ground
for 1 h in a laboratory roller ball mill, using ceramic
grinding balls. This was undertaken to achieve a
desirable particle size distribution for supplementary
cementitious materials (d50 \ 20 lm and d90 \ 100
lm) that is typical for use in cementitious materials
[30].
For the development of blend formulations, about
300 kg of London Clay from the Westgate site was
industrially calcined (IC) in a rotary kiln (hereafter
referred to as Westgate-IC). The Westgate clay was
selected on the basis of logistical convenience of
sourcing larger quantities of material within the
planned works schedule. The as-received Westgate
clay was granulated into smaller pieces, calcined in a
rotary kiln at 800 C with a residence time of 1 h, and
subsequently ground in a ball mill. Figure 2 shows the
size and colour of the clay at different stages of pre-
and post-calcination. Characterisation data for West-
gate-IC is included in the Supplementary Information.
2.2.2 Characterisation
After processing of the clays, the following analyses
were performed:
XRD patterns were collected using a Panalytical
Empyrean diffractometer (45 kV, 40 mA), using a
range of 4–702h, and a step size of 0.01312h. X’pert
Highscore plus V5.1 was used for phase identiﬁcation
using PDF-4 ? 2022 ICDD database. Identiﬁcation of
mineral phases was aided by reference to Kemp and
Wagner [27], and mineral abbreviations were used in
line
with
Clay
Minerals
Society
nomenclature
described in Warr [43]. The diffractograms obtained
from XRD were used to investigate the mineral phase
assemblages via Rietveld reﬁnement, using the exter-
nal standard method where pure corundum ([ 99%
purity Al2O3) was tested separately at the same condi-
tions, and used as an external standard for analysis
using the K-factor obtained from the standard for
estimation of amorphous content. Structure ﬁles from
the 2022 ICDD PDF-4 ? database were used for
ﬁtting. Due to lack of Powder Diffraction File (PDF)
structure ﬁles for the clay mineral montmorillonite, its
low angle (\ 102h) 001 reﬂection was excluded from
the analysis—it was hence treated as part of the
background intensity. Due to limitations on the
availability of structure ﬁles for 2:1 clays, the struc-
tural ﬁle for a muscovite (a micaceous mineral) was
used to ﬁt the illite peaks. Hence, the results for the
proportions of minerals present in the bulk are semi-
quantitative.
TG-MS measurements were conducted using a
Netzsch STA 449 F5 coupled with a Netzsch QMS
403D mass spectrometry unit. 20 ± 1 mg of sample
was used for each measurement, using an alumina
crucible. Samples were evaluated between 30 and
1000 C using a heating rate of 10C/minute, under
nitrogen atmosphere using a ﬂow gas rate of 60 mL/
min. Kaolinite and carbonate contents of the source
clays were estimated using the method described by
Snellings et al. [42]. For kaolinite, a threshold range of
400–600 C was used for calculating dehydroxylation
mass loss; for carbonates, a threshold range of
600–800 C was used for calculating the mass loss
due to thermal decomposition. Mineral content esti-
mates were calculated as wt% values, with respect to
Materials and Structures (2023) 56:174

the dry mass of each clay (deﬁned here as the mass at
250 C). Estimates of uncertainty were made by
varying the threshold temperatures ranges to plausible
minimum (400–550 C for kaolinite, and 625–775 C
for
carbonates,
respectively)
and
maximum
(300–625C for kaolinite, and 600–825 C for car-
bonates, respectively) ranges.
Particle size distribution (PSD) measurements were
conducted using a Malvern Mastersizer 3000, using a
dispersing unit at a rotation speed of 1400 rpm. An in-situ
ultrasonication treatment of 5 min was carried out before
each measurement. Average values were calculated for
each sample from 10 measurements of 4 s duration. For
clays, a dispersal medium of dionised water was used,
using a pinch of sodium hexametaphosphate as a
dispersal agent. The optical parameters used were
refractive
index = 1.56,
and
absorption
coefﬁ-
cient = 0.01 [44]. For the cement powder, isopropanol
was used as the dispersing medium, and measurement
were collected using a refractive index = 1.7, and
absorption coefﬁcient = 0.1 [44].
To determine the chemical reactivity of the cal-
cined clays, the evolved heat method referred to as R3
test was adopted according to the ASTM C1897-20
[45] standard, using a TAM Air calorimeter. The
reactivity thresholds established speciﬁcally for cal-
cined clays based on 7-day cumulative heat val-
ues [46] were used to classify the calcined clays
assessed in this study according to their chemical re-
activity category.
To develop anunderstandingofhow clay mineralogy
affects calcined clays’ chemical reactivity determined
according to the R3 testing method, a series of reference
clays were also tested. C–K is a kaolinitic clay, calcined
at 800 C. Suplementary information reporting chem-
ical composition and thermogravimetric analysis of the
C–K is made available in Table S6 and Figure S1,
respectively. This was selected to be a point of
comparison, as it is a kaolinitic clay with similar
kaolinite content (* 27wt%) tothe threeLondonClays
used in this study, but only quartz as remaining fraction,
enabling to identify the contribution of kaolinite reac-
tivity alone. In addition, a series of manufactured
metakaolins were made, by blending an industrially
sourced, high-purity metakaolin (Imerys Metastar 501)
with quartz. These were selected to provide a hypothet-
ical trend line, for how kaolinite content might be
expected to inﬂuence the chemical reactivity of cal-
cined clays. Characterisation data for these clays is
provided in the Supplementary Information.
2.2.3 Blended cement formulations and compressive
strength assessment
Two replacement levels of industrially calcined
Westgate clay (Westgate-IC) were chosen to work
with for mix design development: 50 wt% and 70 wt%.
These will subsequently be abbreviated as ‘‘CC50’’
and ‘‘CC70’’. The main reasons why this research is
limited to study binary mixes with calcined clay are:
(i) Enable the higher waste clay re-utilisation possible
and consequently minise the volumes of spoil ending
in landﬁll, (ii) Compliance with UK standards which
permits calcined pozzolana to replace up to 55% of
CEM I while ternary mixes with limestone are not
included, and (iii) Less complication on-site as using a
ternary binder adds greater complexity for on-site
production with sourcing, grinding and blending of
limestone.
For each replacement level, the inﬂuence of gyp-
sum addition (0, 1, 3, 5 wt%) on reaction kinetics was
investigated
using
isothermal
calorimetry.

determining the optimal gypsum addition for each
calcined clay replacement level, isothermal calorime-
try at 20 C was carried out in a TAM Air calorimeter
to study the hydration kinetics. Approximately 9 g of
cement paste (6 g of binder ? 3 g of water) was used
for the calorimetry measurements, mixed in-situ using
a vortex mixer for 2 min before placement inside the
instrument. Gypsum addition was attempted as high
volume replacement is known to create additional
sulphate demand. The level of gypsum addition will be
abbreviated as using a ‘‘-GN’’ sufﬁx, where N refers to
the % of gypsum addition. Details of the blend
composition is summaried in Table 2
To assess the effect of different replacement levels
of calcined clay on setting time, a Vicamatic 2
(CONTROLS S.p.A.) automated Vicat tester was
used to measure setting time. Optimal blended
formulations were then used to produce mortar
specimens to determine the mechanical strength
development of these materials after 2, 7, 28 and 90
days’ curing. Compressive strength measurements
were carried out on mortar cubes (50 9 50 mm), in
line with BS EN 12390-3:2019 [47]. Mortar were
prepared with CEN standardised sand with a cement:
sand ratio of 1:3 and a water to binder ratio (w/b) of
0.5. Superplasticizer was added to ensure sufﬁcient
workability in the mortar based on the results reported
elsewhere [48]. A MATEST compression instrument
was used with a loading rate at 3000 N/sec, and
average compressive strength values were calculated
from three mortar cube specimens.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Mineralogy of excavated clays
XRD patterns (Fig. 3) revealed broad similarities in the
mineralogy of the three raw clays. All clays contained
kaolinite, as well as the 2:1 clay minerals montmoril-
lonite and illite. Dolomite and smaller amounts of
calcite were present in all three raw clays. Minor/trace
amounts of pyrite were present in all three of the raw
clays, and minor/trace amounts of gypsum were
present in the Westgate and Euston clays. Powder

These clay minerals were also identiﬁed by Zhou
et al. [18] studying a London Clay and in other studies
on common clays [34, 35]. A wide range of associated
minerals can be found in clays, depending on their
formation conditions [49]—the majority of associated
minerals
identiﬁed
here
have
previously
been
observed in a range of different occurrencies of
London Clay [27]. Whilst kaolinite containing quartz
occurs very frequently in clays used in the SCM
literature, the other clays minerals present are not so
well-understood.

kaolinite in all three raw clays [50]. Evolution of CO2
(Fig. 5b) over the range of 600–800 C conﬁrmed the
presence of carbonate minerals (dolomite and/or
calcite) in all three raw clays [50]. The more intense
weight loss in this region for the Westgate clay
indicated a higher content of carbonates. Evolution of
S2/SO2 (Fig. 5c) over the range of 450–650 C
conﬁrmed the presence of minor amounts of pyrite
in all three raw clays [50], as previously identiﬁed by
XRD (Fig. 3). Total mass loss at 1000 C was in the
range of 10.5–12.3%—this range indicates small
differences in the quantities of each mineral present
between the different clays.
Mineral phases of particular interest were kaolinite
and carbonates (including both dolomite and calcite).
From TG results (Fig. 4), an estimate was made using
mass loss from TG for the quantities present in each of
the three raw clays (Table S2 in the Supplementary
Information). Whilst the Euston and Victoria clays
present similar contents of kaolinite (about 28%), the
Westgate clay had a slightly lower kaolinite content
(i.e., 22%) and slightly higher carbonates content.

The optimal calcination temperature was antici-
pated to be a trade-off between an increased dehy-
droxylation of the kaolinite as well as amorphization
of the 2:1 clay minerals (beneﬁcial to reactivity), and
decomposition of carbonate phases (deleterious to
hydration) [18, 51]. Calcination temperatures of
700C and 800C were therefore selected, for a
duration of one hour in a static laboratory furnace.
Clays with a mixed clay mineralogy and a range of
associated minerals offer distinct characterisation
challenges compared to kaolinitic clays. Firstly, there
is likely to be some degree of overestimation in
kaolinite content when using TG analysis. This is
because non-negligible mass loss arises from other
clay minerals and associated minerals, which occurs in
the same temperature range as kaolinite dehydroxyla-
tion. This can be seen in the CO2 and SO2 evolved gas
data which conﬁrms the decomposition of carbonate
and sulphate minerals in the 400–600 C temperature
range. TG-MS data presented (Fig. 5) shows the need
to critically cross-link characterisation data when
adopting the mass loss method [52] to estimate
kaolinite content in complex clays. The same applies
vice versa: it is likely that TG estimates for the content
of carbonate minerals is an overestimate, given that its
decomposition range overlaps with that of kaolinite.
3.2 Physical characteristics of calcined clays
On the basis of previous experience in the optimal
particle size distribution of calcined clays [30], upper
bounds of d50 \ 20 lm, d90 \ 100 lm were used as
acceptable limits. All the calcined clays met these
particle size requirements. d50 \ 20 lm widely
accepted range for cementitious materials that are
used to substitute to Portland cement. The d50 and d90
values of the calcined clays after grinding are
presented in Table S3, and particle size distribution
curves are provided in Figure S2 in the Supplementary
Information ﬁle, respectively.
3.3 Mineralogy of calcined clays
The crystalline minerals identiﬁed in all three clays
after calcination at 700 and 800 C were broadly
similar, albeit with some differences (Fig. 6). Dehy-
droxylation of kaolinite was complete for all calcined
clays, as seen from the absence of the kaolinite 001
peak at 12.42h. A small amount of calcite was still
detected after calcination at 700C in all three clays,
from the doublet peaks at 29.3 and 48.42h. Negligible
calcite was detected in the Euston and Victoria clays
after calcination 800 C, suggesting thermal decom-
position was near-complete. However, a low intensity
calcite peak was still detected in Westgate 800 C,
indicating that a small amount of calcite still remained
after calcination at 800 C, probably calcite formed
from decomposition of dolomite to MgO and CaCO3.
Differing extents of carbonate decomposition with
different calcination temperatures was also observed
in a previous study [51].
No pyrite was detected in the calcined clays for all
three clay sources, from the absence of characteristic
peaks at 28.7 and 37.32h. Instead, peaks associated
with hematite (PDF# 04-015-9576) were observed at
33.1 and 35.62h. This demonstrates the decomposi-
tion of pyrite to form hematite was completed at both
calcination temperatures studied. This observation
agrees with previous work which also showed that
calcination above 650C was sufﬁcient to decompose
pyrite [38]. This is an important ﬁnding which is
particularly encouraging towards the adoption of
calcined London Clay as an SCM in concrete, since
pyritic clays are often deleterious for concrete ele-
ments [53]. Oxidation of pyrite (Fe2S) has been known
to release sulfate which could cause potential sulfate
attack and also create acidic environment in the long-
term exposure [54, 55]. Such sulfate attack due to
pyrites present in sub-soil has been problematic in
several regions of UK, US, and Canada [55, 56]. In the
only previous study on calcination of London Clays
[18], no calcite, dolomite or pyrite were identiﬁed in
the raw clay, so there is no direct comparison to be
made in this regard. This difference between the clays
in these two studies is not surprising, as the presence of
minor associated minerals is known to vary within the
London Clay formation [27]. It is worth also noting
that there might be occasions where clays are
contaminated with other deleterious substances with
regards to the durability of reinforced concrete, such
as chlorides. Chlorides are expected to be found in
clays in the vicinity of marine environments or in clays
associated with saline groundwater conditions. In the
particular case of London Clay considered herein, the
samples investigated did not exhibit any signiﬁcant
chloride content, owing to the locations considered. In
locations where London Clay is closer to the river

Thames or Thames estuary, higher probability of
chloride presence might be encountered.
The thermogravimetric, differential thermogravi-
metric curves (Fig. 7) and evolved gas curves (Fig. 8)
support the ﬁndings from the XRD analysis (Fig. 6).
Just as the presence of thermal mass loss event at a
characteristic temperatures can indicate the presence
of a given mineral [50], the absence of characteristic
mass loss events can indicate the absence of a given
mineral. Dehydroxylation of kaolinite was completed
for all calcined clays, as seen from the absence of the
peak with its centre at approximately 500 C in the
dTG (Fig. 8a, e, i) and H2O (Fig. 8b, f, j) evolution
curves. This is consistent with the XRD results
discussed above. The majority of carbonate phases
(mostly dolomite) decomposed after calcination at
700 C [57], as seen from the reduction in magnitude
of the peak centred at approximately 700 C in the
CO2 evolution curves. Decomposition of carbonates
seemed to be complete after calcination at 800C in
the Euston (Fig. 8c) and Victoria (Fig. 8k) clays, but a
small amount of carbonates seemed to remain for
Westgate 800C (Fig. 8g). These observations are
consistent with reduction in the intensity of the
reﬂection associated with carbonate minerals identi-
ﬁed by XRD (Fig. 6). Lastly, the conversion of pyrite
to hematite in all the calcined clays was conﬁrmed the

absence of the peak centred around 500 C in the S2/
SO2 evolution curves—this is consistent with the XRD
results (Fig. 6) and previous ﬁndings [38].
Table 3 summarises the mineralogical composition
of the raw and calcined clays, as determined by semi-
quantitative Rietveld XRD analysis. Estimated kaolin-
ite content of the raw clays varied from 15 to 18 wt%.
This is slightly lower than the range of 21–28 wt%
kaolinite content estimated from TG results (Supple-
mentary Information–Table S2). Part of this discrep-
ancy may potentially be explained by an overlap
between dehydroxylation of kaolinite, and dehydrox-
ylation of other clay minerals present (which cannot be
fully captured in the method used here to estimate
uncertainty) [42]. Thus, whilst estimates from both
XRD and TG give a broadly similar range, the TG
results can be considered as a more optimistic upper
limit. A further challenge around characterisation is
difﬁculties in quantifying 2:1 clay minerals using
conventional characterisation methods. Values for
mineral contents estimated applying quantitative XRD
data need to be interpreted carefully, due to inherent
limitations
of
this
techniques
and
unavoidable
uncertainties in the analysis process [58]. For exam-
ple, the lack of suitable structural ﬁles hinders the
quantiﬁcation of smectite and illite clay minerals.
Therefore, the estimated values for mineral contents in
Table 3 should be considered as semi-quantitative.
Overall, the mineralogical changes in the clays after
calcination were broadly similar, with some small
differences. Complete dehydroxylation of kaolinite
was achieved for both calcination temperatures, across
all London Clays. Pyrite and dolomite were not
detected in the calcined clays, due to thermal decom-
position of these phases during calcination. Whilst the
majority of carbonates were decomposed after calci-
nation at both temperatures, small amounts did remain
in some cases. Pyrite is a mineral known for its
detrimental expansive behaviour in concrete [59, 60].
If calcination temperatures are not high enough to
cause its decomposition to hematite, then it could be a
cause of concern. In this study, decomposition of
pyrite was achieved for both 700 and 800 C, across
all source clays. Industrial calcined (IC) Westgate soil
has a marginally higher amorphous content from the

3.4 Chemical reactivity of calcined clays
The R3 testing results of the calcined clays evaluated
are reported in Fig. 9. In each case, clays calcined at
800 C exhibited slightly higher heat ﬂow values
between 1 and 4 days after mixing (Fig. 9a). This
resulted in a modest increase in 7-day cumulative heat
for clays calcined at 800 C, compared to 700 C
(Fig. 9b). For equivalent calcination temperatures, the
Euston clays had slightly higher reactivity values than
the Westgate clays. This could be due to the Euston
clay having a combination of a slightly higher
kaolinite
content
(Suppementary
Information–
Table S2) and slightly ﬁner particle size distribution
(Suppementary Information–Table S3) compared to
the Westgate clay.
The 7-day cumulative heat values for all the
calcined clays are listed in Table S4 in the Supple-
mentary Information ﬁle. Robustness testing of the R3
test methods established the single operator coefﬁcient
of variance for 7-day cumulative heat to be 2.3% [61].
For the range of 7-day cumulative heat values, this
corresponds to a standard deviation in the range of
5.4–7.1 J/(g of SCM). The magnitude of the difference
between the clays calcined at 800 and 700 C is 67.2
and 75.9 J/(g of SCM), for the Euston and Westgate
clays respectively. Because these differences did not
fall within the expected range of single operator
variation, they were considered to represent meaning-
ful differences in the measured reactivity. From the
7-day cumulative heat values (Supplementary Infor-
mation–Table S4), all the calcined clays meet the 90%
conﬁdence threshold to classify as ‘‘moderately reac-
tive calcined clays’’ (i.e. [ 190 J/(g of SCM)) con-
sidering the thresholds recommended by Londono-
Zuluaga et al.[46]. Out of the three clays investigated,
the Westgate clay was selected to industrially produce
a pilot-scale batch on the basis of logistical conve-
nience of sourcing larger quantities of material within
the planned works schedule. Given the similar min-
eralogy and reactivity performance of the three clays,
one clay was deemed to be sufﬁciently representative
to
take
forward
for
development
of
blend
formulations.
The estimates of amorphous content from quanti-
tative XRD (Table 3) are consistent with the obser-
vations
from
R3
reactivity
data.
R3
reactivity
measurements on an industrially sourced, high purity
metakaolin found the 7-day cumulative heat value to
be 1150 J/g of SCM (Fig. 9b). The six calcined
London Clays considered in this study yielded 7-day
cumulative heat values in the range of 234.5–329.0 J/g
of SCM (Supplementary Information–Table S4).
These values lie in the range of 20–30% of the value
for the high-purity metakaolin (as highlighted in the
Fig. 9). The amorphous content estimates of approx-
imately 12–20% made via Rietveld reﬁnement are

clays as a function of the calcination temperature, where
(A) corresponds to clays calcined at 700 C and (B) corresponds
to clays calcined at 800 C. C-K, a kaolinitic clay with similar
kaolinite content to the London clays, was calcined at 800 C—
it is plotted here as a reference curve

174
thus broadly consistent with the observations from
cumulative heat data.
The overall R3 results for C–K are consistent with
the calcined London clays reactive content identiﬁed
in this material. The reference kaolinitic clay (C–K
calcined at 800 C) was chosen as the clay contained
only quartz along with 27 wt% kaolinite content.
However, it is interesting to observe differences in the
gradients of the cumulative heat curves over different
time periods between kaolinite only clay and mixed
London Clay. This highlights the difference in the
contribution to chemical reactivity from reactive
phases formed from different minerals i.e., only
kaolinite (as in C–K) and kaolinite along with other
clays minerals (as in three London clays considered in
this study). The reaction kinetics during the R3 test are
slower for the calcined London Clays compared to the
K–C reference kaolinite clay within the ﬁrst 48 h
(Fig. 9b). However, beyond the ﬁrst 48 h, the calcined
London Clays seem to react more quickly than the K-C
reference kaolinite clay. This is likely associated with
the content of 2:1 minerals in the London Clays—
calcined 2:1 clay minerals are expected to exhibit
slower dissolution characteristics compared to meta-
kaolin [62, 63].
In order to elucidate the contribution of calcined 2:1
minerals to chemical reactivity of the calcined clays
studied, a reference system was used. Testing reactiv-
ity of metakaolins of controlled purity, by blending an
industrially sourced high purity metakaolin with
quartz, gives a hypothetical trend line for reactivity
expected from metakaolinite content alone (Fig. 10).
This makes possible to infer whether the presence of
the calcined 2:1 clay minerals makes a contribution to
reactivity above and beyond that expected from
kaolinite alone.
The horizontal arrows in Fig. 10 extrapolate the
hypothetical kaolinite content from the experimentally
observed 7-day cumulative heat for the calcined
London Clays. While the kaolinite content of the
raw clays (determined via quantitative XRD, Table 3)
were in the range of only 15–20%, calcined London
Clays have a reactivity potential equivalent to kaolin-
ite content of maximum 30% (using the trendline
generated from the reference metakaolins) due to the
contribution from other clay minerals. Whilst the R3
reactivity test offer insights into the overall chemical
reactivity associated with the kaolinite content in the
raw clay, a degree of caution is needed in interpreting
this analysis. As described in Sect. 3.4, the cumulative
heat curves in Fig. 9 show that the calcined London
Clays continue to react beyond 7 days, in a way that
the C–K reference clay did not. Given the slower
reaction kinetics of mixed clays, due to their 2:1
mineral content, the R3 test may slightly underestimate
the reactivity of mixed clays in practice, if run only for
7 days as recommended by the standard.
The notion of what constitutes an ‘optimal’ calci-
nation temperature when processing a given source
clay is open to debate. R3 tests make it straightforward

to make a quantitative comparison of chemical
reactivity at different temperatures. And yet, chemical
reactivity is only one of the factors that needs to be
considered when deciding on a calcination tempera-
ture in these systems. Two other factors are the
formation of expansive phases resulting from the
thermal decomposition of carbonate minerals (i.e.
calcite and dolomite), and the impact of the resultant
process emissions on the overall embodied carbon of
the calcined clay.
Previous studies have identiﬁed a trade-off between
an increased dehydroxylation of 2:1 clay minerals
(beneﬁcial to reactivity), and decomposition of car-
bonate phases (deleterious to reactivity) [18, 51]. In
this study, the majority of carbonates were decom-
posed after calcination for all clays at both 700 and
800 C, although small amounts did remain in some
cases. The decomposition pathway of dolomite is
distinct from calcite, and merits special attention.
Dolomite thermal decomposition leads to an increase
in calcite content along with potential formation of
MgO and release of CO2; if calcite is present in a
calcined clay after calcination, this could produce an
aluminate-carbonate reaction leading to formation of
carboaluminates in hydrated cement matrix. However,
negligible amounts of free lime and periclase were
identiﬁed in the XRD patterns after calcination at both
700 and 800 C.
For the type of carbonate minerals in the three
sources of London Clay studied herein, the additional
carbon footprint (relative to a clay without any
carbonate minerals) associated with the decomposi-
tion of carbonate minerals was estimated to be in the
range of 24–42 kg/tonne of calcined clay. In compar-
ison, a typical embodied carbon of thermal treatment
is estimated to be at least 240 kg/tonne [41]. Therefore,
decomposition of carbonate minerals is likely to make
a minor, rather non-negligible, contribution to the
overall embodied carbon of the processing of London
Clay speciﬁcally and calcined clays in general.
In the case of the sources of London Clay evaluated
in this study, the minor quantity of carbonate minerals
(estimated \ 10 wt%) suggest that there is more to
gain than to lose by calcining at a higher temperature
of 800 C. More reactive material might lead to higher
CEM I replacement levels for comparable strength
developments, offsetting the embodied carbon asso-
ciated with the decarbonation of carbonate minerals
during calcination. However, this should not be
extrapolated as a universal ﬁnding across mixed clays.
For clays with a high content of carbonates and a lower
content of clay minerals, it may be the case that a
slightly lower calcination temperature is more favour-
able on balance.
3.5 Blend cement formulations optimisation
A high volume replacement of CEM I with SCMs is
known to create a sulphate demand due to additional
aluminates and surface area introduced by the SCM
that affect early age hydration kinetics of clinker
phases [64–66]. Hence it is important to check for
sulphate demand to ensure blends prepared with
calcined London Clay is formulated to ensure maxi-
mum reaction potential at early age. The heat ﬂow
curves for the CC50 (Fig. 11a) and CC70 (Fig. 12a)
series both exhibited a similar trend—the aluminate
peak shifted to later times with increasing gypsum
content. At 24 h, the pastes with 1 wt% gypsum
exhibited the highest heat ﬂow values for both CC50
and CC70 series. The heat release values were lower
for the CC70 series due to higher replacement level of
CEM I. Values of cumulative heat at 24 h were also
marginally highest for the 1wt% gypsum addition
(Fig. 13). It would therefore be expected that the 1
wt% gypsum addition blends would exhibit higher
1-day strength. The gypsum demand did not change
with the increase in replacement level from 50 to 70
wt%. This is mainly due to the relatively low
metakaolin content of the industrially calcined West-
gate clay.
The optimised gypsum addition for both CC50 and
CC70 was therefore identiﬁed to be 1 wt%. Setting
time measurements were carried out for both these
optimised blends (i.e. CC50-G1 and CC70-G1), and
compared to CEM I (Fig. 14). The setting window for
CC50-G1 and CC70-G1 is 6–8 h. CC70-G1 is
marginally faster setting than CC50-G1, and both
blends exhibit noticeably accelerated setting relative
to CEM I despite a delay in heat release observed from
calorimetry. In this case, normliased heat ﬂow per
gram of Portland cement was able to conﬁrm the
acceleration in reaction kinetics; although heat ﬂow
per gram of paste does not showcase any acceleration
of reaction. Similar reduction in setting time has been
observed with other calcined clays in previous studies,
attributed to the addition of calcined clay increasing

nucleation of calcium aluminosilicate hydrate (C–A–
S–H) on ﬁne calcined clay particles at early ages [67].
3.6 Compressive strength development
The compressive strength values (Fig. 15). were
consistently lower for the CC70 series, compared to
the CC50 series. As expected, increased w/b ratio
resulted in a decrease in compressive strength, across
both replacement levels. The addition of calcined clay
often contributes to strength increase within 7 days of
curing [29, 68, 69], and the results reported here are
consistent with what has been observed in other
calcined clays blended systems [67]. However, it is
worth mentioning that all these studies have reported
minimal strength development after 28 days while
with calcined London Clay there is considerable
strength development after 28 days, probably due to
the slower reactivity.

4 Conclusions and recommendations
The rich variety inherent in naturally occurring clay
resources offers numereous potential for SCM pro-
duction; but it also presents challenges. On the one
hand, this study shows that 800 C is an effective
calcination temperature for London Clays, in terms of
reactivity performance and avoiding potentially prob-
lematic mineral phases. However, it is also highlighted
that care is needed in characterisation work and
decision-making. Whilst XRD and TG are techniques
familiar to those in the cement industry, quantifying
the presence of 2:1 clay minerals and a range of
associated minerals is not straightforward. R3 reactiv-
ity cumulative heat results showcase the chemical
reactivity of calcined excavated London Clay. Its
potential as a material suitable for SCM usage was
validated by the compressive strength development of
blended cements produced with them.
London Clay samples from three different locations
displayed very similarly behaviour, despite being
sourced several kilometres away from each other.
Whilst geological surveys can offer valuable insights
into the expected mineralogy of excavated material in
a given area, detailed characterisation is still necessary
for quality control. Whilst many of the principles
around characterisation and selection of calcination
temperature are more-or-less universal, these forma-
tion-speciﬁc ﬁndings of the present stuidy on London
Clay cannot be transferred wholesale to other geolog-
ical resources (e.g., Oxford Clays, Etruvia Marls)
without further validation. The R3 results showed that
the 2:1 clay minerals present in London Clays react

more slowly than conventional kaolinitic clays, and
that they may be making a non-negligible contribution
to reactivity at 7 days and possibly beyond. Therefore,
it is recommended to extend the R3 testing duration to
14 days for these type clays, to avoid underestimating
the
true
potential
chemical
reactivity
of
these
materials.
Compressive
strength
results
from
optimised
blended formulations indicate that high levels of
CEM I substitution (up to 70 wt%) by calcined London
Clays are achievable for the potential production of
concretes of different strength grades. Work is
currently underway to develop further understanding
on designing blended cements, and conducting con-
crete mixes trials using calcined London Clay SCM.
Whilst low-risk applications will be the starting point
for concretes made with calcined London Clay,
durability monitoring in natural exposure conditions
will still be essential for validating performance of
these concretes in service.
The notion of ‘technological robustness’ will be
critical to the use of excavated materials for calcined
clay production. The ﬂexibility and versatility of on-
site production is highly attractive as an agile approach
to waste minimisation and valorisation. However, this
alternative production model, in contrast to cen-
tralised, static production at a large clay deposit, has
the ﬂipside of more attention needed to characterising
the excavated materials and their variability to control
the quality of the materials produced from different
construction sites.
