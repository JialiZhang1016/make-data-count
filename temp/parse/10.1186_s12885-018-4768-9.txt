Abstract
Background: The preoperative growth of human glioblastomas (GBMs) has been shown to vary among patients.
In animal studies, angiogenesis has been linked to hypoxia and faster growth of GBM, however, its relation to the
growth of human GBMs is sparsely studied. We have therefore aimed to look for associations between radiological
speed of growth and microvessel density (MVD) counts of the endothelial markers vWF (Factor VIII related antigen)
and CD105 (endoglin).
Methods: Preoperative growth was estimated from segmented tumor volumes of two preoperative T1-weighted
postcontrast magnetic resonance imaging scans taken ≥14 days apart in patients with newly diagnosed GBMs. A
Gompertzian growth curve was computed from the volume data and separated the patients into two groups of
either faster or slower tumor growth than expected. MVD counts of the immunohistochemical markers von
Willebrand factor (vWF) (a pan-endothelial marker) and CD105 (a marker of proliferating endothelial cells) were
assessed for associations with fast-growing tumors using Mann-Whitney U tests
and a multivariable binary logistic regression analysis.
Results: We found that only CD105-MVD was significantly associated with faster growth in a univariable analysis
(p = 0.049). However, CD105-MVD was no longer significant when corrected for the presence of thromboses and
high cellular density in a multivariable model, where the latter features were significant independent predictors of
faster growth with respective odds ratios 4.2 (95% confidence interval, 1.2, 14.3), p = 0.021 and 2.6 (95% confidence
interval, 1.0, 6.5), p = 0.048.
Conclusions: MVDs of neither endothelial marker were independently associated with faster growth, suggesting
angiogenesis-independent processes contribute to faster glioblastoma growth.

Background
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malig-
nant brain tumor in adults [1], with a median overall sur-
vival of only 10 months in unselected patients [2]. GBMs
are characterized by a highly heterogenous histopathology
[3–5], a high secretion of pro-angiogenic factors [6, 7], ex-
tensive vascularity [8, 9], and rapid pretreatment growth
[10, 11]. The pretreatment growth has been shown to vary
considerably among patients [10] and slower growth to be
an independent predictor of long term survival in patients
with GBM [12].
It is of major interest to understand biological processes
behind the variations in speed of growth observed in
human GBMs, which in turn could reveal future targets of
therapies hampering growth. We have recently studied re-
lations between histopathological features and radiological
speed of pretreatment tumor growth [13]. We found that
thromboses and high cellular density were significant in-
dependent predictors of faster preoperative tumor growth
[13]. These findings are in line with hypotheses suggesting
thrombosis as an initiator of hypoxia facilitating outward
tumor
expansion,

angiogenesis [9, 14]. Neovascularization is fundamental
for the survival and expansion of tumors [15], and angio-
genesis has been extensively linked to hypoxia and growth
of GBM in animal studies [16–19]. However, in random-
ized trials, antiangiogenic therapy has not shown any sig-
nificant survival benefit in GBMs [20, 21]. Still, the degree
of angiogenesis has not been assessed for relations with
radiological speed of pretreatment growth in human
GBMs.
In a cohort of 102 GBMs previously assessed for radio-
logical speed of growth [10], we sought to investigate pos-
sible associations between pretreatment speed of tumor
growth and the degree of angiogenesis quantified by
microvessel density (MVD) measurements. The MVDs
were immunohistochemically assessed by means of two
endothelial markers: von Willebrand factor (vWF or
FVIII related antigen), a pan-endothelial marker [22],
which illustrates the metabolic demand of the tumor [23];
and endoglin (CD105), a marker of proliferating endothe-
lial cells [24], which reflects the degree of angiogenesis
[23]. In addition, we investigated the correlation between
the MVDs and their associations with the histopatho-
logical features thromboses, high cellular density, high vas-
cular density, and mitotic count.
Methods
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
As previously described, patients were retrospectively se-
lected from all newly diagnosed GBM patients ≥18 years
of age operated at St Olavs Hospital – Trondheim Uni-
versity Hospital, Norway between January 2004 and May
2014 (262 patients) [10]. Selection criteria were ≥2 pre-
treatment T1-weighted postcontrast magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) scans separated by ≥14 days and histo-
pathologically verified GBMs according to the 2007 World
Health Organization (WHO) Classification [25]. Exclusion
criteria were non-contrast-enhancing tumors and glioma-
tosis cerebri (defined by radiological criteria [26]). In
addition, four cases were excluded because of insufficient
tissue amount or morphology for the MVD assessments,
which left 102 patients eligible for further analyses.
Volume segmentation and growth rates
The segmentation of tumor volumes and establish-
ment of growth rates have previously been described
in detail [10]. The volume segmentation was per-
formed by ALS and controlled by EMB (a neuroradiol-
ogist)
using
the
software
BrainVoyager
QX
(Brain
Innovation, Maastricht, The Netherlands). Both preopera-
tive MRI scans were segmented for total tumor volumes,
defined
as
the
combined
volume
of
the
non-contrast-enhancing central part (i. e. necrosis)
and
the
contrast-enhancing
rim.
In
addition,
the
reproducibility of the tumor volume assessments has
been assessed and concluded as satisfactory [10].
The fitness of different growth patterns based on the
segmented tumor volumes and the time intervals be-
tween the scans, have previously been assessed [10]. The
Gompertzian growth pattern (Fig. 1) was concluded as
the most biologically reasonable growth pattern [10],
and all tumors were assumed to follow this growth pat-
tern. Since growth rates were highly dependent upon
tumor volume [10], a point estimate (such as doubling
time) would be a wrong representation of tumor growth.
To account for this issue, we calculated an expected
Gompertzian growth curve based on the volume data
from 106 patients [10]. The curve dichotomized the pa-
tients into having tumors with a larger or smaller volume
increase than expected from the curve (i.e. fast-growing or
slow-growing tumors) (Fig. 1) [10]. These two groups have
previously been shown to associate with survival of GBM
patients [12]. In the current study, these groups were
assessed for associations with the MVDs.
Histopathology
All routine hematoxylin-eosin (HE) sections for each
case have previously been microscopically assessed by
VEM (a medical research student) and controlled by
SHT (an experienced neuropathologist) for the presence
of 30 different histopathological features, which have
previously been described in detail [13]. These features
were assessed for associations with the same groups of
growth, and thromboses, high cellular density, vascular
density, and mitotic count were of interest to this study.
Thromboses were defined as vascular structures partly
or completely occluded with fibrin. The general cellular
and vascular densities of viable tumor areas were sub-
jectively graded as low, moderate, or high. For statistical
analyses, the 2 lowest categories were merged, because
very few cases were graded as low in both variables. Mi-
toses were counted in 10 high-power fields (HPFs) in
areas of highest mitotic counts (hotspots).
Immunohistochemistry
From each patient, one representative tumor sample
from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
were cut at 4 μm, dried, deparaffinized, and rehydrated.
Of the 102 cases, 11 cases had sections from FFPE fro-
zen tissue. We applied vWF (vWF, 1:2000, polyclonal

termined by titrations. For CD105, antigen retrieval was
achieved with proteolytic enzymes, endogenous perox-
idase activity was quenched with peroxidase block, and
sections were incubated with the primary antibody for

24 h at 4 °C with cover glass after pretreatment with
serumfree proteinblock. Both endothelial markers had
negative controls and positive internal controls.
Quantification of microvessel densities
MVDs of vWF and CD105 were assessed by VEM, who
was blinded to the growth data. A Nikon Eclipse 80i
microscope and a Nikon CFI 10×/22 grid at × 400 mag-
nification (area within the grid equal to 0.059 mm2) were
used for the MVD assessments. MVDs were assessed
after the methods of Weider et al. [27] with some modi-
fications. MVDs were computed as the mean count of
vessels within the grid for three HPFs of highest vascular
densities (i. e. hotspots). Hotspots were identified by
scanning using × 4 and × 10 objectives on vWF sections;
corresponding hotspots were identified on CD105 sec-
tions. Only areas with ≥50% of viable central tumor tis-
sue were counted. Tissue edges and areas with excessive
hemorrhage and/or desmoplasia were avoided. Any indi-
vidually stained endothelial cell or vessel within or in
contact with the grid were counted. Moreover, because
of the heterogeneous morphology of GBM vessels [28],
each lumen was counted for long branched vessels and
glomeruloid tufts as described by Kraby et al. [29]. In
addition, separate units of ≥2 staining endothelial cells
within the same vascular structure were counted as one
vascular unit. Altogether, one case was not assessed for
vWF-MVD due to high background staining, and an-
other case was not evaluated for CD105-MVD due to
non-existent antigenicity.
Statistical analyses
The estimation of growth rates and curves were computed
using R version 2.13.1 [10] and analyses involving histo-
pathology and MVDs were performed using IBM SPSS
Statistics 24. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05
without corrections for multiple testing. The correlation
between vWF-MVD and CD105-MVD was assessed using
the Spearman rank correlation test. Associations between
both MVDs and histopathological features were assessed
using Mann-Whitney U tests (categorical vs continuous)
and Spearman rank correlation tests (continuous vs con-
tinuous). vWF-MVD and CD105-MVD were further in-
vestigated for associations with fast-growing tumors using
Mann-Whitney U tests. Finally, CD105-MVD was in-
cluded in a multivariable binary logistic regression model
with the histopathological features previously found to be
significantly associated with faster growth in the same pa-
tients (thromboses, high cellular density, and mitotic

due to significant associations with all other features in-
cluded [13].
Results
Patient characteristics
Of the 102 included patients, 69% (70 patients) were
male. The mean age was 63 years, range 26–83 years
old. All cases were immunopositive for glial fibrillary
acidic protein (GFAP) and two for isocitrate dehydrogen-
ase mutation (IDH1-R132H) [12]. Eighty-two patients
(80%) were preoperatively treated with corticosteroids.
The median tumor volume was 17.7 mL (range 0.05–
146.45 mL) from the first MRI scans and 27.5 mL (range
0.98–243.52 mL) from the second MRI scans. The median
interval between the scans was 22.5 days, range 14–98 days.
Overall, 52 patients (51%) had fast-growing tumors, and pa-
tient characteristics within the growth groups have previ-
ously been reported [12].
Descriptive data
We observed that both markers stained endothelial
cells quite specifically. vWF had a strong and granular
cytoplasmic staining pattern, whereas CD105 had a
more even and occasionally weaker cytoplasmic stain
(Fig. 2). Generally, little background staining was ob-
served, except in a few vWF sections. The distributions
of both vWF-MVD and CD105-MVD were skewed, and
the median vWF-MVD was 15.5 per field (range 0.7–
62.0) and the median CD105-MVD was 12.7 (range
0.7–50.0).
Relationships between MVDs of the endothelial markers
vWF-MVDs and CD105-MVDs were significantly corre-
lated (p < 0.001, ρ = 0.92). A scatterplot showing the rela-
tionship is found in Fig. 3. The median CD105-MVD/
vWF-MVD ratio was 0.91 with 95% confidence interval
(0.87, 0.95).
MVD and histopathology
Of the features previously found to significantly associate
with faster growth in univariable analyses (thromboses,
high cellular density, and mitotic count) [13], only mitotic
count was significantly associated with any MVD in this
study (Table 1). However, CD105-MVD tended to be
higher in cases with present thromboses or high cellular
density despite the non-significant associations. The same
tendency was observed for vWF-MVD and thromboses
(Table 1). Interestingly, both MVDs were significantly as-
sociated with subjectively evaluated high vascular densities
on HE sections.
MVD and growth
In this study, only CD105-MVD was significantly asso-
ciated with faster tumor growth in the univariable ana-
lyses (Table 2). However, the ranges of both MVDs
were quite wide within both fast and slow-growing tu-
mors (Table 2, Fig. 4). Nevertheless, CD105-MVD was
no longer significant in a multivariable model including
thromboses and high cellular density, where the two
latter features were significant independent predictors
of faster growth (Table 3).
Discussion
In this study, CD105-MVD, and not vWF-MVD, was
significantly associated with faster growth in the univari-
able analyses. However, the relation was lost when
adjusted for the presence of thromboses and high cellu-
lar density in a multivariable model, where these two
latter features were significant independent predictors of
faster growth. Both MVDs associated significantly with
mitotic count, but neither with the presence of throm-
boses nor high cellular density.
Biological reasons for why some GBMs grow faster
than others are sparsely studied in human patients,
which is mainly due to difficulties in acquiring in vivo
pretreatment growth estimates [10, 11]. In addition,
most research on growth processes have been conducted

on in vitro or animal models which fail to accurately
imitate the unique micro-milieu of the human GBM
[30]. Moreover, by having preoperative growth as an
outcome variable instead of overall survival, we avoid
the effects of clinical factors found to be influential on
survival, such as age at diagnosis, tumor size at diagno-
sis, Karnofsky performance status, comorbidity, and
effects of treatment. Corticosteroid treatment was the
only preoperative treatment received by our patients (82
patients); however, it was not significantly associated with
tumor growth when corrected for tumor volume [10], and
associations between histopathology and growth were in-
dependent of such treatment [13]. Altogether, these as-
pects of the study made it possible to study the biology of
GBM growth as unaffected as clinically justifiable.
Endothelial markers and angiogenesis
The prognostic role of MVD measurements in glioblast-
omas is unclarified [31–35]. However, a few studies have
reported that vWF-MVD and CD105-MVD may predict
the malignancy grade and prognosis of gliomas [36, 37].
The finding that only CD105-MVD was significantly asso-
ciated with growth in the univariable analyses, is in line
with other univariable studies which have found more
promising results for CD105-MVD than for CD31-MVD
(a pan-endothelial marker) as prognostic markers of GBM
[33, 34]. These studies speculated the potential prognostic
inferiority of pan-endothelial markers (i.e vWF, CD31,
CD34)
was
caused
by
the
additional
staining
of
pre-existing angiogenically inactive vessels [23]. In con-
trast, many studies have shown that CD105 predomin-
antly stain proliferating endothelial cells [22, 33, 38–46].
However, a few studies have observed CD105-positive ves-
sels in normal [47] and GBM-adjacent brain tissue [48],
and the marker needs further validation. Moreover, it has
been shown that vWF sometimes fail to stain microvessels
in both normal and neoplastic tissue [46].
vWF-MVD and CD105-MVD were highly correlated
(Fig. 3), with a higher median and upper range for
vWF-MVD. In addition, the high CD105-MVD/vWF-MVD

linear pattern in line with the high correlation coefficient (ρ = 0.92). However, the spread increases for higher MVD counts

ratio suggests most vasculature of GBM are angiogenically
active. Because the markers were counted in corresponding
HPFs, a high correlation coefficient was expected. However,
some of the differences in the MVDs could be caused by
random variations in vascular densities of different sections
and the granular staining of vWF (Fig. 2), which sometimes
made it more difficult to distinguish separate vascular units
than in CD105 sections.
Neovasculature and tumor growth
CD105-MVD was no longer significantly associated with
preoperative tumor growth in a multivariable model
with thromboses and high cellular density, where both
latter features were significant independent predictors of
faster growth (Table 3). However, reverse causation may
also be possible: faster growth could lead to thromboses
and high cellular density. Furthermore, we observed that
fast-growing tumors could have quite low CD105-MVD
scores and slow-growing quite high (Table 2, Fig. 4),
which was in line with the finding that CD105-MVD ex-
plained very little of the variance in speed of growth
(3%) in the univariable analysis (data not shown). Similar
ranges of CD105-MVD were observed within the growth
groups when patients with sparse tissue amounts (46
cases) were excluded (Additional file 1), and the weak
association was thus unlikely a result of sampling errors.
Altogether, our results suggest that vWF-MVD and
CD105-MVD are not predictive of faster GBM growth.
There are several biological mechanisms which could
potentially explain the inferiority of CD105-MVD as an
independent predictor of tumor growth. One reason could
be that tumors can create a surplus of or ineffective vascu-
lature due to excessive angiogenic stimuli [23], potentially
leading to an overrepresentation of MVD counts. Exces-
sive angiogenic stimuli may be caused by oncogenic muta-
tions (known as hypoxia-independent angiogenesis [49]).
Other explanations could be that other mechanisms of
glioma-associated neovascularization account for add-
itionally needed vasculature in fast-growing tumors [49],
such as vascular co-option [50], vasculogenesis [51, 52],
vascular mimicry (non-endothelial vasculature) [53], and
glioblastoma-endothelial
cell
transdifferentiation
[42].
Vascular mimicry is the process most likely to be over-
looked by our methodology due to the lack of endothelial
cells. In addition, the presence of vascular mimicry has
been found to significantly predict higher glioma grades
and worse prognosis [53]. However, it is uncertain to
which degree and how the different processes of neovas-
cularization interact, and further studies are needed [49].
In our previous study, we speculated that hypoxia initi-
ated by thromboses facilitated growth through an induc-
tion of angiogenesis [13]. However, the finding that the
presence of thromboses was still a significant independent

predictor of faster tumor growth when the degree of
angiogenesis was not, suggests angiogenesis-independent
mechanisms driven by hypoxia contribute to faster
GBM growth. Such hypoxia induced mechanisms may
act through other mechanisms of glioma-associated
vascularization [49], augmentation of proliferation [54,
55], and initiation of invasiveness [19, 55]. Increased in-
vasiveness is one of the proposed mechanisms of resist-
ance to anti-VEGF (bevacizumab) treatment [55–59],
and thus the lack of survival benefit in randomized tri-
als [20, 21]. Some studies even suggest GBM growth is
possible without an induction of angiogenesis [19, 60].
Such angiogenesis-independent growth may be described
by the “go-or-grow” hypothesis, where tumor cells switch
between two mutually exclusive phenotypes of either pro-
liferative or invasive characteristics [61, 62]. Hypoxia has
been proposed to induce the switch to the invasive pheno-
type [62]. In this way, hypoxic tumor cells migrate away
from hypoxic areas and switch back to a proliferative
phenotype when nutrients are adequate without an induc-
tion of angiogenesis [60]. In addition, Sakariassen et al.
[19], discovered that xenotransplanted GBMs in nude rats
could present as fatal diseases without signs of angio-
genesis. Nevertheless, invading cells are unlikely to be
captured as contrast enhancement without an induc-
tion of angiogenesis [19, 59, 63], and are therefore un-
likely to have been measured in our study. Additionally,
the
non-significant
multivariable
association
for
CD105-MVD could perhaps be caused by the nearly sig-
nificant associations between CD105-MVD and throm-
boses and high cellularity (Table 1). Collectively, our
findings support that angiogenesis-independent mecha-
nisms driven by hypoxia contribute to faster GBM growth,
which might explain the lack of survival benefit of
anti-VEGF treatment.
As thromboses, high cellular density maintained its
role as a significant independent predictor of faster
growth in our study (Table 3). This finding substanti-
ates our previous speculation that it is a better marker
of high proliferation rates than high mitotic counts, because
mitotic count has many potential sources of errors [64],
and higher counts were significantly associated with the
presence of thromboses [13] and increasing CD105-MVD
counts (Table 1).
Microvessel methodology
So far, there is no standard method for quantification of
MVD, however, initiatives on international standardiza-
tions have been made [65]. Like in our study, most stud-
ies are based on the methods described by Weidner et
al. [27] with modifications: they count single positive
cells
and
avoid
areas
of
sclerosis,
necrosis,
and
non-neoplastic tissue. However, few have specified their
handling of glumeruloid tufts and longer vessels. We be-
lieve as Leon et al. [36], that counting a glomeruloid tuft
as one vascular unit might underestimate the angiogenic
stimuli of the tumor. Furthermore, the subjective assess-
ment of hotspots and interpretation of positive immuno-
staining
give
rise
to
problematic
inter-observer
variability, which has been reported as quite high for
MVD assessments in GBMs [66].
Even though we found significant associations with
both MVDs and subjectively assessed high vascular
densities on HE slides, the spreads of the MVDs were
wide within and overlapping between the categories of
vascular density (Table 1). These findings were in line
with the fact that capillaries is known to be inconspicu-
ous on HE slides [28].
Strengths and limitations
Limitations of the assessments of tumor volumes on MRI
scans, growth rates, and histopathological features have
previously been described in detail [10, 13]. The main
strengths are the relatively large number of patients with a
population based referral and the reproducibility assess-
ment of tumor volumes [10]. Potential biases are selection
biases, preoperative steroid treatment, differences in diag-
nostic MRI scanners, different timing and administration
of the contrast agent, tumor cells existing beyond the con-
trast enhancing rim [67, 68], and sampling errors and
inter-observer variability of the histopathological assess-
ments. Additionally, our analyses were exploratory and
should be validated in future studies.
Conclusions
Our results showed that MVD assessments of vWF and
CD105 were not independent predictors of radio-
logical speed of growth, although CD105-MVD was sig-
nificantly
associated
with
faster
growth
in
the
univariable analysis. In contrast, thromboses and high cel-
lular density were significant independent predictors of fas-
ter
growth.
In
summary,
our
findings
suggest
angiogenesis-independent mechanisms contribute to faster
GBM growth.

Additional file 2: Dataset supporting conclusions. The minimal dataset
necessary to replicate the findings reported in the article. Microvessel
densities (MVDs) of both markers are presented as mean counts for 3
high-power fields (HPFs). Regarding the categorical histopathological
features (thromboses, high cellular density, and high vascular density), “1”
indicates that features are present, while “0” indicates that they are not.
Mitotic counts are counted in 10 HPFs. Tumors growing faster than
expected are indicated by “1”, whereas slow-growing tumors are
indicated by “0”. Patients preoperatively treated with corticosteroids or
having sparse amount of tissue available for the histopathological
evaluation are indicated by “1” in the respective variables. (XLSX 15 kb)

Authors’ contributions
VEM and SHT conceived and designed the study. VEM and SHT confirmed
the histopathological diagnoses and performed the assessment of
histopathological features. VEM did the microvessel density assessments.
USG performed the immunohistochemical staining of vWF and CD105. ALS
and EMB performed the segmentations of tumor volumes on MRI scans.
ALS and ØS computed the growth data. VEM, ALS, ØS, OS, and SHT were
involved in the analysis and interpretation of data. VEM wrote the
manuscript, and all authors have critically revised the manuscript. The
study was supervised by OS and SHT. All authors read and approved the
final manuscript.
Ethics approval and consent to participate
The study was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee (Central) as part
of a larger project (references 2011/974 and 2013/1348) and adhered with
the Declaration of Helsinki. Most patients had provided written informed
consent to be included in a related glioma outcome study (reference 2011/974).
The regional ethics committee waived informed consent for retrospective
evaluation of patient data for the remaining patients, and did not require
obtained written informed consent from a relative/guardian.
Consent for publication
