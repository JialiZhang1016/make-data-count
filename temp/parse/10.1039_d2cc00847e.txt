Here we present the anion binding and anion transport properties
of a series of calix[6]arenes decorated on their small rim with either
halogen bond or hydrogen bond donating groups. We show that
the halogen bond donating iodotriazole groups enable highly
selective transport of chloride and nitrate anions, without transport
of protons or hydroxide, at rates similar to those observed with
thiourea or squaramide groups.
Synthetic ion transporters have potential for the treatment of
channelopathies, such as cystic fibrosis, linked to deficient ion
transport.1,2 Most anion transporters described in the literature
rely on hydrogen bonding (HB) between relatively acidic hydro-
gen atoms and the anion.3 However, deprotonation of these
acidic HB donors can lead to a net transport of protons along
with the anions.4,5 Proton transport is linked to an increasing
risk of toxicity,6 which is interesting in the context of anti-
cancer activity, but undesirable for treatment of channelopa-
thies. Selectivity for (i) anion transport without dissipation of
pH gradients and (ii) certain anions over others represent
major challenges in anion transport.7
A strategy to achieve selective transport of anions is the use
of less acidic H-bond donors,4,8,9 or interactions based on
Sigma holes.10 A Sigma hole is an electron deficient region on
a bound halogen, chalcogen, pnictogen, or tetrel atom, which
can interact with electron rich entities, such as anions.11–13
This interaction is referred to as halogen bond (XB) if it involves
a halogen atom, which are typically less toxic than the other
atoms which can bear a Sigma hole. The use of XBs in transport
has been pioneered by Matile and co-workers.14 Various
XB-based transporters have been studied15–18 and a 5-fold
selectivity for transport of chloride over HCl transport by an
XB donor was recently reported by Langton, Beer, and
co-workers.19 However, published studies compare transporters
with XB donors to those with an H atom in the place of the
halogen atom, rather than comparing XB donors to powerful
HB donating motifs, such as (thio)ureas and squaramides.20–22
Here we present a comparison between XB and HB donating
compounds in terms of anion binding, transport activity, and
selectivity, using receptors with (Fig. 1): iodotriazoles as XB
donors (1a), regular triazoles as control (2), and squaramides or
(thio)ureas as strong HB donors (3–5). Three of these groups
were attached to the small rim of a calix[6]arene to effectively
bind the anion and shield its charge from the apolar interior of
the membrane. The value of this calix[6]arene-based design was
demonstrated previously by the activity of tris-urea 4 and tris-
thiourea 5 as anion receptors23 and carriers.24 The larger
iodotriazole binding groups are also readily accommodated
by the calix[6]arene platform.25 Electron-poor bis(CF3)phenyl
rings were used to increase the binding strength of the various
motifs.20–24 These groups and the calix[6]arene skeleton also
ensure that the overall lipophilicity and lipophilic balance26 of
the studied receptors is similar (see Table 1 for c log P values).

Two additional calix[6]arenes bearing iodotriazole units with
pNO2phenyl (1b) and phenyl groups (1c) were prepared to
evaluate the effect of the electron withdrawing substituents
on binding and transport by XB donors.
Iodotriazole-based receptors 1a-c were prepared in 70–80%
isolated yield from the reported calix[6]arene tris-azide 6,27 via a
cycloaddition reaction with the corresponding iodoalkynes 8a-
c,
in
the
presence
of
copper(I)
and
tris(benzyltriazolyl-
methyl)amine (TBTA) as catalyst in THF18 (Scheme 1, see ESI†
for details28). Triazole-based receptor 2 was prepared from
calix[6]arene tris-azide 6 in 97% yield via a cycloaddition with
alkyne 9 in the presence of 2,6-lutidine and a catalytic amount
of copper(I) in DCM.27 The squaramide containing receptor 3
was isolated in 45% yield from the reaction of calix[6]arene tris-
amine 727 and compound 10 in methanol : DCM (9 : 1), using
DIPEA as base.29 Receptors 4 and 5 were prepared following
previously reported procedures.23,24
The anion binding properties of receptors 1–5 were studied
via
1H-NMR titrations with tetrabutylammonium chloride
(TBACl) in acetone-d6 or CDCl3. Binding constants were deter-
mined by fitting the shift of the signals of the protons closest to
the binding site to a 1 : 1 model30 (see Table 1 and ESI†).28 For
receptor 1a in acetone, the signals show a linear shift during
the addition of a first eq. of TBACl, while no further changes are
observed when adding up to 5 eq. TBACl, supporting a 1 : 1
binding mode in solution and indicating that the affinity is too
high to be quantified. A Ka of 770 M1 was found for 1a in
chloroform and lower affinities were found for receptors 1b and
1c, which have fewer or no electron withdrawing groups on the
aryl rings. Compound 2, which only has triazole groups,
showed the weakest binding of Cl. When comparing XB-
based receptor 1a to HB-based receptors 3–5, which have the
same aryl groups, we observe that, in acetone, 1a has an affinity
which is at least two orders of magnitude higher than those of
3–5 (Table 1).31 This trend is inverted in CDCl3, in line with
previous observations that XB donors show lower anion affi-
nities in chloroform than in acetone.32 Titrations of 1a with
various other anions revealed the following trend in affinities:
Cl 4 Br c H2PO4
 4 NO3
, AcO (Table S1, ESI†), indicat-
ing selectivity for halides over oxoanions.
The molecular structure of receptor 1a determined by single-
crystal X-ray diﬀraction (SCXRD, Fig. 2) shows that the methoxy
groups of the calix[6]arene are oriented into the cavity and the
arms oriented outward. The three XB donor iodotriazole groups
coordinate one molecule of water by O  I interactions with a
distance of 3.179(2) Å. The coordination sphere of the water
molecule is completed by a second molecule of 1a to aﬀord an
octahedral geometry around the oxygen atom (Fig. 2c and Fig.
S63, ESI†). This structural analysis shows that the three XB
donor groups of 1a can indeed cooperate to act as an eﬃcient
receptor towards electronegative atoms, in agreement with the
high aﬃnity observed for chloride.
Receptors 1–5 were studied as transmembrane transporters
for Cl and NO3
 using the lucigenin assay.20 They were
preincorporated in the lipid bilayer of large unilamellar vesicles
(LUVs) that contained the chloride sensitive dye lucigenin in a
NaNO3 solution. A NaCl pulse was added to create a chloride
concentration gradient and the quenching of the fluorescence
of lucigenin was monitored to assess Cl influx. The transport
of Cl into the vesicles is compensated by the transport of NO3

out of the vesicles, ensuring the charge balance (Cl/NO3

antiport). XB-based receptor 1a shows clear transport activity
at concentrations down to 1 transporter per 25 000 lipid

molecules (0.004 mol%, 16 nM), 1b showed poor activity (too
low to quantify), and 1c and 2 were inactive at 1 : 1000 trans-
porter to lipid ratio (Fig. 3a). The decrease in activity with a
decreasing number of electron withdrawing substituents on the
aryl group and the absence of transport by 2 confirm the role of
the Sigma hole in anion transport.
When comparing XB-based receptor 1a to HB-based recep-
tors 3–5, all with bisCF3phenyl groups, the highest transport
rates were observed with tris-squaramide 3, followed by 1a and
previously reported tris-thiourea 5, and the lowest rate was
given by tris-urea 4 (Fig. 3b and Table 1). This demonstrates
that receptors with XB donor groups can achieve similar trans-
port activities as related receptors with powerful HB donor
groups.
Having established the good activity of 1a, the transport
selectivity of this compound in comparison to transporters 3-5
was studied. For this, the pH sensitive dye 8-hydroxypyrene-
1,3,6-trisulfonic acid trisodium (HPTS) was encapsulated and a
buﬀer solution with N-methyl-D-glucosamine hydrochloride
(NMDGH+Cl) and HEPES at pH 6.8 was used inside and
outside the vesicles. Transport was initiated by addition of a
base pulse (NMDG) giving an exterior pH of 7.7. In this assay,
the dissipation of the pH gradient (by transport of H+ or OH)
can only be balanced by the transport of Cl, as NMDGH+ is a
membrane impermeable cation.4
Receptors 3–5 gave efficient transport, while no significant
activity was observed with 1a even at a transporter:lipid ratio of
1 : 1000 (Fig. 3c and d). This shows that 1a is incapable of
dissipating a pH gradient via either H+Cl symport or OH/Cl
antiport. Transport of HCl by 3–5 follows the same order as for
Cl/NO3
 antiport, with tris-squaramide 3 giving the highest
rates, followed by tris-thiourea 5 and tris-urea 4. The experi-
ments were also run in the presence of the H+ transporter
carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). No impact
was observed on the rates of transport by 3–5, indicating that
transport of H+ is not rate limiting for these transporters with
acidic H-bond donors. In contrast, the addition of CCCP clearly
switched on the transport of 1a, even when present at concen-
trations as low as 1 : 100 000. This can be attributed to Cl
uniport by 1a coupled to H+ transport by CCCP and shows that
1a has 4100-fold selectivity for electrogenic Cl transport over
H+Cl symport or OH/Cl antiport. As 1a has no acidic
protons, net transport of HCl by a mechanism involving depro-
tonation of a binding group upon anion release4 is indeed
impossible. Furthermore, 1a has B20-fold higher selectivity
compared to the recently reported transporter with two XB
donor groups,19 which is likely to originate from the efficient
encapsulation of Cl anions by the three XB donor groups on
the calix[6]arene. These experiments demonstrate that trans-
porter 1a has an unprecedented selectivity in combination with
a good activity (EC50 of B0.007 mol%).
Similar experiments were performed, replacing Cl by NO3

(NMDGH+NO3
 buﬀer), and selectivity of 1a for electrogenic
NO3
 transport over H+NO3
 symport (or OH/NO3
 antiport)
was observed (Fig. S60, ESI†). The rate of NO3
 uniport by 1a
was lower than that of Cl uniport. HB-based transporters 3–5

showed again hardly any selectivity. In contrast to 3–5, 1a was
also found incapable of transporting OH or H+ in absence of
transportable anions such as Cl and NO3
 (Fig. S61, ESI†).
This remarkable selectivity of 1a was further highlighted using
the lucigenin assay in NaHCO3 or NaOAc solutions to test for
Cl/HCO3
 and Cl/AcO antiport (Fig. S57 and S58, ESI†). In
both experiments clear activity was observed for transporter 3,
but not for 1a. This shows that 1a is not only highly selective for
Cl compared to HCl transport, but also for Cl compared to
other anions. The anion transport selectivity of 1a follows the
order: Cl 4 NO3
 444 HCO3
, AcO, OH and is correlated
to its selectivity in anion binding.
In contrast, HB donors commonly show anion binding selec-
tivities that correlate with the hydration energy or hydrogen bond
accepting ability of the anions.33,34 As a result, HB-based receptors
are very general transporters and only a slight selectivity of 5 for
transport of NO3
 4 Cl was observed.35 We note that, despite
the poor selectivity, tris-squaramide 3 showed the highest trans-
port activity of the series of compounds tested in all the transport
assays used. This is in agreement with previous reports on
squaramides with a single binding unit which outperformed
ureas and thioureas,21 while attempts to achieve similar results
in structures with two or three binding units often failed due to
too strong binding or poor solubility of the squaramides.29,36
In conclusion, this study of transport activity and selectivity
of lipophilic calix[6]arenes with diﬀerent anion binding groups
has revealed the remarkable selectivity of halogen bond donor
1a to transport Cl and NO3
, compared to the transport of
other anions and to the dissipation of pH gradients. This high
selectivity is accompanied by a transport activity on par with the
analogous tris-thiourea 5 and close to tris-squaramide 3. This
demonstrates that XB donor groups connected to a platform
can achieve transport rates similar to those of powerful HB
donors, while providing a superior selectivity for Cl, which
opens the way to therapeutic applications of XB donors for
treatment of channelopathies such as cystic fibrosis, where Cl
transport is required but dissipation of pH gradients could lead
to undesired side eﬀects.
