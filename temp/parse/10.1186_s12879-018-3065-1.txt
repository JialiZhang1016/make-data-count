Abstract
Background: A method for rapid detection of dengue virus using the reverse-transcription recombinase polymerase
amplification (RT-RPA) was recently developed, evaluated and made ready for deployment. However, reliance solely on
the evaluation performed by experienced researchers in a well-structured and well-equipped reference laboratory may
overlook the potential intrinsic problems that may arise during deployment of the assay into new application sites,
especially for users unfamiliar with the test. Appropriate assessment of this newly developed assay by users who are
unfamiliar with the assay is, therefore, vital.
Methods: An operational utility test to elucidate the efficiency and effectiveness of the dengue RT-RPA assay was
conducted among a group of researchers new to the assay. Nineteen volunteer researchers with different research
experience were recruited. The participants performed the RT-RPA assay and interpreted the test results according to
the protocol provided. Deviation from the protocol was identified and tabulated by trained facilitators. Post-test
questionnaires were conducted to determine the user satisfaction and acceptability of the dengue RT-RPA assay.
Results: All the participants completed the test and successfully interpreted the results according to the provided
instructions, regardless of their research experience. Of the 19 participants, three (15.8%) performed the assay with no
deviations and 16 (84.2%) performed the assay with only 1 to 5 deviations. The number of deviations from protocol,
however, was not correlated with the user laboratory experience. The accuracy of the results was also not affected by
user laboratory experience. The concordance of the assay results against that of the expected was at 89.3%. The user
satisfaction towards the RT-RPA protocol and interpretation of results was 90% and 100%, respectively.
Conclusions: The dengue RT-RPA assay can be successfully performed by simply following the provided written
instructions. Deviations from the written protocols did not adversely affect the outcome of the assay. These suggest
that the RT-RPA assay is indeed a simple, robust and efficient laboratory method for detection of dengue virus.
Furthermore, high new user acceptance of the RT-RPA assay suggests that this assay could be successfully deployed
into new laboratories where RT-RPA was not previously performed.

Background
Early diagnosis of dengue depends on the detection of the
virus by either nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) [1–4]
or detection of dengue virus (DENV) nonstructural protein
1 (NS1) antigen especially that configured into the rapid de-
tection test (RDT) format [5–9]. The NS1 detection
method is among the most widely used as it is rapid and
simple to perform [9]. The method, however, has its limita-
tion, especially when utilized in dengue endemic regions
where secondary dengue is common [5, 9–11]. NS1 assay
sensitivity in detection of secondary dengue infection is
much lower, hence, may contribute to false negative results
[12, 13]. A complementary detection method is therefore
needed [14]. The NAAT has been suggested as the most
suitable complementary test since the test allows for direct
detection of DENV genome from samples of patients ob-
tained during the viremic phase (< 5 days after fever onset).
While there are a number of NAATs available, the most
common NAAT method for detection of DENV has been
the quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain re-
action (RT-PCR) [15–17]. The test is highly sensitive, spe-
cific, and can be easy to perform especially by trained
personnel. Unfortunately, due to its requirement for highly
specific equipment and reagents, usage of the test has been
confined to the well-funded and well-equipped referral la-
boratories [18, 19]. The use of NAAT in a resource-limited
setting such as peripheral laboratories in many dengue en-
demic regions of the Southeast Asia is, therefore still lim-
ited [20–22]. In recent years, extensive efforts have been
undertaken to develop NAAT for the use in these resource-
limited settings for various infectious diseases [23–26]. Im-
plementation of the NAAT as a preferred diagnostic test in
this setting, however, remained challenging. The ideal diag-
nostic test should be a simple, rapid, sensitive, specific, and
requires minimal laboratory infrastructure [27]. A more
cost-effective NAAT format that met all the aforemen-
tioned criteria hence, is needed.
The invention of the isothermal NAAT that requires
no or minimum laboratory infrastructure has the poten-
tial to overcome the barrier to the use of NAAT in
resource-limited setting [28–31]. The isothermal NAAT
usually has a simple protocol, easy to perform, does not
require a sophisticated instrument, and straightforward
result interpretation procedure [32–34]. We recently re-
ported a simple, rapid, sensitive, and specific single tube
pan-dengue reverse-transcription recombinase polymer-
ase amplification (RT-RPA) method for early detection
of DENV [1]. This method showed comparable sensitiv-
ity to the reference real-time RT-PCR test. The dengue
RT-RPA assay was performed on an inexpensive portable
fluorometer and took only approximately 20 min to per-
form with minimal reagent and equipment cost. This
NAAT assay hence, has a potential for use in a resource-
limited setting [1]. However, a diagnostic assay with
excellent performance in itself is insufficient. The feasi-
bility of a diagnostic test for use in resource-limited set-
ting relies heavily on the robustness of the assay and
acceptability by the end users. With this in mind, in the
present study, we assessed the operational utilities of the
previously described dengue RT-RPA assay, which in-
cludes ease to use, the time required to perform the
assay, and user acceptability.
Methods
Study design
The usability of performing the RT-RPA assay was
assessed among a group of volunteers who were new to
the assay. The operational usability of the RT-RPA was
evaluated for three focus areas: 1) effectiveness, 2) effi-
ciency and 3) satisfaction. The definitions of the terms
of the three areas were as defined below:
1. Effectiveness: the accuracy and completeness with
which users can achieve specified goals in a
particular environment.
2. Efficiency: the time needed to complete the tasks
strictly according to the provided written protocols.
3. Satisfaction: the comfort and acceptability of the
work system to the users.
Participants
Seven researchers were recruited from the Arbovirus Sur-
veillance Laboratory at the Tropical Infectious Disease
Research and Education Centre (TIDREC). In addition,
we recruited two groups of researchers from i) molecular
research laboratories (7 researchers) and ii) antiviral re-
search laboratory (5 researchers) from the Department of
Medical Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of
Malaya (UM), to participate in the usability testing. A total
of 19 researchers with different research experience partic-
ipated in the study (Additional file 1: Table S1).
Reagent and DENV RNA
The DENV-specific TwistAmp RT exo lyophilized kit
was supplied by TwistDx Ltd., Cambridge, United King-
dom under the European Union FP7 DengueTools
agreement 282589 [1]. The lyophilized kit consisting of
1)
lyophilized
RT-RPA
pellet
with
dengue-specific
primers, probes, and fluorescently-tag probes, and 2)
customized rehydration buffers consisted of magnesium
acetate, potassium acetate, Tris-acetate, and polyethylene
glycol 35,000. A random subset of 152 RNA samples ex-
tracted from the sera of dengue-suspected patients re-
ceived between March and May 2015 were used. DENV
RNA samples were provided by the WHO Collaborating
Centre for Arbovirus Reference & Research (Dengue/Se-
vere Dengue) (WHO CC) at the UM. The reference RT-
RPA assay was initially performed by trained laboratory

personnel of the WHO CC. The WHO CC at UM had
previously successfully participated in the WHO WPRO-
conducted EQA program for dengue diagnostics [19].
Results from the reference RT-RPA assay were used as the
reference for the current study. Out of the 152 RNA sam-
ples, 97 were dengue RT-RPA positive, and 55 were den-
gue
RT-RPA
negative
samples.
In
the
WHO
CC
laboratory, all the dengue RT-RPA positive samples
showed positive amplification results between 5 and 8 min
after initiating the assay. From these samples, each partici-
pant was randomly provided with eight samples to test.
Setting
The participants were requested to perform the RT-RPA
assay following a given standard written protocol (Fig. 1).
The participants conducted the assay individually by read-
ing the protocol, and there was no discussion among the
participants. During the test, each participant was accom-
panied by one test facilitator who observed and took notes
of the user’s conduct of the test. After the run, participants
were asked to record the test results. Following completion
of the test, participants were requested to complete a post-
testing questionnaire adapted from the After-Scenario
Questionnaire developed by Lewis [35] to gauge the user’s
acceptance and satisfaction towards the test.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using Prism GraphPad
V5.01 [36]. One-way ANOVA was performed to deter-
mine the mean difference between the participants with
different research experience against the number of de-
viations from the standard protocol. The same statistical
test was also employed to assess the mean difference of
groups with 1) different number of deviations from the
standard protocol, and 2) different years of research ex-
perience against the result accuracy obtained.
Results
Ease of performing the improved RT-RPA assay
Nineteen participants who had never performed RPA
assay were enrolled into this usability testing. The partic-
ipants were grouped according to their respective la-
boratories
and
research
experience.
Based
on
the
participant’s research experience, 31.6% (6/19) of the
participants were with less than 1-year of research ex-
perience, 36.8% (7/19) with 1 to 5 years of research ex-
perience, while the remaining 31.6% (6/19) of the

Page 3 of 9
participants had more than 5 years of research experi-
ence. All 19 participants completed the test.
Effectiveness
The effectiveness of the given instruction as the standard
protocol to perform the test was evaluated for complete-
ness and accuracy with which the user performed the
test (Table 1). During the usability test, of the 19 partici-
pants, 15.8% of the participants performed the test with-
out deviations. The majority of the participants (84.2%)
performed the test with 1 to 5 deviations from the
protocol. None of the participants had more than 5 devi-
ations from the protocol during the test.
In order to investigate the possible correlation between
the participants’ research experience and the deviations
that occurred during the test, we analyzed the deviations
from the protocol and their respective years of research
experience (Table 2). For participants with research ex-
perience of less than 1 year, 2 out of 6 participants (33.
3%) performed the test without deviations, while 66.7%
of the participants with less than 1-year research experi-
ence performed the test with 1 to 5 deviations. None of
the participants from the group with less than 1-year
research experience performed the test with more than
5 deviations. For the group of participants with 1 to
5 years research experience, all of them (100%) per-
formed the test with 1 to 5 deviations from the protocol.
For participants with more than 5-year research experi-
ence, only 1 participant (16.7%) performed the test with-
out deviations. The remaining of the participants (83.
3%) performed the assay with 1 to 5 deviations. There
were no statistically significant (p-value = 0.5545; one-
way ANOVA; Table 3) differences of the mean of devia-
tions occurred during the RT-RPA procedure between
the groups of participants with a different year of re-
search experience (< 1 year, 1 to 5 years, and > 5 years).
We analyzed the number of deviations that occurred
for each step during the test (Table 4). Results obtained
suggested that step 10 and 14 that involved “inverting
the strip several times vigorously” showed the highest
percentage of deviations from the protocol. 14 out of 19
participants (73.7%) performed step 10 with deviations.
For step 14, 9 out 19 participants (47.4%) performed this
step with deviations. 3 out of 19 participants (15.8%)
performed step 13 which involved removing the test
strip from the machine after the machine alarm gave
“beep” sound, with deviations.
Out of 152 samples, we were unable to detect the signal
(positive or negative) for two samples (Additional file 2:
Table S2). These samples were considered to have failed
the RT-RPA assay. These samples were tested by the same
participant, suggesting that the failure could be operator-
dependent. The overall accuracy of the RT-RPA assay was
calculated based on the remaining 150 samples. By
comparing the test results of the test performed by the
participants against the reference test results, the accur-
acy of test performed by the participants was at 89.3%

(134 /150; Table 5). Of the 16 samples that contributed
inconsistent results, seven were false positive, and nine
were the false negative. Two out of the false positive sam-
ples displayed negative amplification pattern on the read-
out graphs. These two negative samples somehow were
called as ‘positive’ with the built-in software in Twista®
fluorometer (TwistDx, UK). While for the false negative
samples, eight out of nine showed late amplification pat-
tern, suggesting low target copy number RNA samples.
The One-way ANOVA analysis was also used to investi-
gate the relationship between the number of the devia-
tions
from
the
protocol,
and
participant’s
research
experience versus the result accuracy. Our results showed
that there were no statistically significant mean differences
in the result accuracy between groups of participants with
different research experience (Table 3). Similarly, the
number of deviations from the standard protocol did not
significantly affect the result accuracy (Table 3).
Efficiency
The efficiency of performing the test was evaluated by
the time needed for the participants to complete the test
for all eight samples. This included active working time,
15 min amplification time, and time required for inter-
pretation of the results. In the present study, all partici-
pants completed the test within 30–45 min.
Satisfaction
The overall satisfaction of test participants toward the
RT-RPA test was assessed by using the post-test ques-
tionnaire. The assessment was divided into two parts;
the participants were asked to evaluate the satisfaction
for i) performing the one-step RT-RPA protocol and ii)
interpreting of results. By using 7-point Likert scales, the
average score for performing the one-step RT-RPA
protocol was 6.21 (Fig. 2; Additional file 3: Table S3).
Overall, as high as 90% of the participants gave positive
feedback. Satisfaction for ease of performing the test and
time needed to perform were 100%. One participant was
not satisfied (rating = 3) with the support documentation
supplied with the test.
For interpretation of results, the average score was 6.
53, which suggested high positive feedback from the par-
ticipants (Fig. 3; Additional file 4: Table S4). Satisfaction
for the ease to interpret the results and support docu-
mentation provided for the test were 100%. One partici-
pant gave a score of 4 (moderate) for satisfaction in the
time required to interpret the results.
Discussion
This study represents an analysis of the operational util-
ity of the DENV nucleic acid detection method, RT-RPA
in preparation for its possible deployment as a labora-
tory diagnostic tool. Implementation of a diagnostic test
in a new testing environment is highly challenging, par-
ticularly in a resource-limited environment. The RT-
RPA assay was previously described as the most rapid
molecular diagnostic tools for detection of DENV [1],
but these studies were conducted under laboratory con-
ditions. A well-designed assay, however, does not neces-
sarily define the successfulness of the test adoption in a

new environment [37]. In the real world context, la-
boratory setting or field-testing site environment can
be highly variable in its infrastructure, availability of
instrumentation, and level of experience of the la-
boratory personnel. The best-developed test may not
have a significant impact unless it is well-adapted into
the existing diagnostic system and can be properly
performed. The challenges are further compounded if
it is to be performed in a resource-limited environ-
ment where the laboratory infrastructure could be
limited. Dengue, in particular, is endemic in many
economically developing regions where resources for
proper laboratory testing can be scarce outside the
major referral healthcare facilities often in the much
urbanized capital cities. The operational utility evalu-
ation of the RT-RPA assay prior to its deployment
and
implementation,
hence
greatly
increase
the
chances of its successful adoption. The operational
utility evaluation would also allow for the necessary
adjustments before the assay deployment.
The dengue RT-RPA assay is easy to perform and does
not require specialized equipment and high level of skill
[38]. In addition to its potential benefit for use in a
resource-limited setting, the test could be implemented
and adopted into the diagnostic algorithm of a well-
established laboratory including those at the referral
level [1, 39]. With this in mind, in the study, laboratory
personnel with different research experience were re-
cruited from different laboratories. This is important to
strengthen the representativeness of the operational util-
ity test. We found no significant differences, however, in
the number of deviations from the RT-RPA protocol to
the research experience of the participants and their la-
boratory background in performing the RT-RPA assay.
The deviations from the protocol may be random and
operator-dependent. In addition to that, we also found
that the number of deviations from the protocol showed
no significant influences on the result accuracy. The dif-
ferences in result accuracy were probably linked to the
specific technical procedure requiring a mixing step for

1) ease to perform the RT-RPA assay, 2) time that needed to complete the RT-RPA assay, and 3) satisfaction of the given written instruction on RT-RPA.
The user satisfaction for each category was rated by a scale of 1 to 7 (strongly disagree to strongly agree)

the redistribution of the amplicon aggregates formed
during the amplification. In the present study, we used
the Twista® fluorometer (TwistDX, UK) to read the amp-
lification. At about 3 min and 45 s after initiation of the
test, a beeping alarm would remind the user to remove
the tube strip from the fluorometer. Sample mixing was
done manually by the operator according to the written
instruction [40]. It was at this specific step in the testing
process that tendency for deviation was high, especially
among new RT-RPA users or in the field setting [41].
This was confirmed in our study, as there were high de-
viations among users who performed the mixing step,
including the way they mixed the sample, the duration
of the mixing and the extent of vigor exerted during the
mixing, regardless of their research experience. The
main reason for these deviations is probably that this
specific step is usually not employed in other NAATs.
The manual mixing procedure, however, is needed to
overcome potential localized depletion of reagents in the
area of high RT-RPA activity on the nucleic acid tem-
plate within the reaction tube [40]. This is a critical step
in the amplification cascade to ensure the continuation
of the RT-RPA assay and efficient consumption of the
reaction mix. In all RT-RPA assays, the mixing step is
highly recommended, especially for samples with a low
copy number of the target [41]. Obviously, this is the in-
herent limiting step of the RT-RPA assay needing further
attention by the assay developer.
Simplification or elimination of the manual mixing step
may help reduce the inter-user variability. One possibility
to rid of the manual mixing step is to perform RT-RPA re-
action in low volume (5 μl) [41]. However, this may not be
feasible as at the onset of fever in dengue; there could be
as high as 1 X 108 of DENV particles per milliliter of
blood [42]. The high concentration of the RNA targets
has been shown to affect the RPA assay performance
adversely [43]. A recent development of the latest RT-RPA
fluorometer, the T-8 isothermal device (TwistDX, UK) that
included a built-in magnetic mixing function may obviate
the need for the manual mixing [41], and this could help
to overcome the current limitation of the assay. With this
improvement, the effectiveness of the assay should in-
crease, and the inconsistency due to operator-related fac-
tors would be reduced.
User satisfaction is the user’s feeling whether the test
is easy to perform, the result is easy to interpret, and
their readiness to perform the test. The perspective from
new users could provide an important comment on the
robustness and feasibility of the assay in the actual user
application. Generally, user satisfaction is interrelated
with the ease of use and efficiency of the assay. An easy
to use assay is usually well-accepted by the user. Results
from our study suggested very high acceptability of the
dengue RT-RPA assay among the new users. This was
probably because i) the required reagents were already
in lyophilized format, ii) only minimum pipetting steps
were needed comparing to the standard RT-PCR or real-
time RT-PCR method, and iii) the assay involved only
short incubation time of less than 20 min compared to
the standard RT-PCR (more than 3 h) and real-time RT-
PCR (45 min to 2 h).
Conclusion
In conclusion, the current study demonstrates the oper-
ational utility of the newly developed dengue RT-RPA
assay. We showed that the dengue RT-RPA assay was ro-
bust, easy to use, efficient, and can easily be performed.
Based on our finding, it is likely that the RT-RPA assay
will receive high acceptance by most possible new users.
Implementation of the dengue RT-RPA could be impact-
ful especially in a resource-limited environment where
dengue is endemic, and it could also be a useful comple-
mentary test in referral laboratories. Simplification of
the RT-RPA protocol by integrating the built-in mag-
netic mixing function in place of the current manual
step should be considered prior to the actual assay
deployment.
