Evolution of Mutator transposable elements
across eukaryotic diversity

Abstract
Background: Mutator-like elements (MULEs) are a significant superfamily of DNA transposons on account of their:
(i) great transpositional activity and propensity for insertion in or near gene sequences, (ii) their consequent high
mutagenic capacity, and, (iii) their tendency to acquire host gene fragments. Consequently, MULEs are important
genetic tools and represent a key study system for research into host-transposon interactions. Yet, while several
studies have focused on the impacts of MULEs on crop and fungus genomes, their evolution remains poorly
explored.
Results: We perform comprehensive bioinformatic and phylogenetic analyses to address currently available
MULE diversity and reconstruct evolution for the group. For this, we mine MULEs from online databases, and
combine search results with available transposase sequences retrieved from previously published studies. Our
analyses uncover two entirely new MULE clades that contain elements almost entirely restricted to arthropod
hosts, considerably expanding the set of MULEs known from this group, suggesting that many additional
MULEs may await discovery from further arthropod genomes. In several cases, close relationships occur
between MULEs recovered from distantly related host organisms, suggesting that horizontal transfer events
may have played an important role in the evolution of the group. However, it is apparent that MULEs from
plants remain separate from MULEs identified from other host groups. MULE structure varies considerably
across phylogeny, and TIR length is shown to vary greatly both within and between MULE groups. Our
phylogeny suggests that MULE diversity is clustered in well-supported groups, typically according to host
taxonomy. With reference to this, we make suggestions on how MULE diversity can be partitioned to provide
a robust taxonomic framework.
Conclusions: Our study represents a considerable advance in the understanding of MULE diversity, host range and
evolution, and provides a taxonomic framework for the classification of further MULE elements that await discovery.
Our findings also raise a number of questions relating to MULE biology, suggesting that this group will provide a rich
avenue for future study.

Introduction
Mutator transposable elements (TEs) are among the most
mutagenic transposons known, due to their very high
rates of transposition and their bias for inserting near or
close to genes [1, 2]. The original Robertson’s Mutator
element (MuDR, ‘Mutator Don Robertson’) was described
in maize, where Mutator lines can display mutation fre-
quencies ~ 50 times the background rate of spontaneous
mutation [3, 4]. Given these qualities, the Mutator system
has a long history of usage in the field of genetic engineer-
ing in both forward and reverse genetic screening, and has
played an important role in shaping our understanding of
host-transposon co-evolutionary interactions [2].
Members of the Mutator DNA transposon superfamily
are termed ‘MULEs’ (Mutator-like elements) [5]. The
structure of MULEs resembles classic “cut-and-paste”
DNA TEs, with Terminal Inverted Repeats (TIRs) at
each end enclosing a transposase domain containing a
catalytic DDE motif, and often an additional zinc finger
DNA-binding motif. However, MULE TIRs are typically
considerably longer than those present in other DNA TE

superfamilies, commonly being hundreds of base pairs
in length. Meanwhile, some families of MULE appear to
lack TIRs completely (non-TIR MULEs) [6]. A further
characteristic of MULEs is the length of their target site
duplications (TSDs), which are short direct repeats cre-
ated following transposition, that occur immediately out-
side of the TIRs and are 8-11 bp in MULE elements [5].
An interesting feature of several MULEs is their acqui-
sition of one or more additional open reading frames
(ORFs). The first complete MULE element described in
maize contained two ORFs: mudrA, encoding the trans-
posase, and mudrB, encoding a protein of unknown
function that is apparently required for integration into
the maize genome [7, 8]. Other classes of MULE may
also contain additional ORFs, such as the mutB ORF
with a DNA binding role in the yeast Mutyl element that
occurs in the same orientation as the transposase ORF
[9], or the vanB and vanC ORFs in the arabidopsis Hiun
element, which are divergent proteins with unknown
and anti-silencing functions, respectively [10]. It is often
assumed that additional ORFs originate from the host
genome, as has been demonstrated in rice and several
other plant genomes [6, 11]. In plant genomes there are
large numbers of non-autonomous Mutator elements
known collectively as ‘Pack-MULEs’, that have lost their
transposase genes and instead carry fragments of host
genes [12]. Additionally, there is evidence that several
MULEs have undergone molecular domestication and
become
exapted
by
host
genomes.
For
example,
MULE-derived genes act as transcription factors that
modulate the light response in Arabidopsis [13, 14],
while the MULE-derived MUSTANG genes, which are
present in all flowering plants, are involved in diverse
processes including flowering, growth and reproduction,
and may have played an important role in early angio-
sperm evolution [15].
MULEs are best known from plant genomes, and
especially maize [7], but they also occur in a wide
range of eukaryotic genomes [2]. For example, over
the last 15 years, studies have described MULEs from
diverse hosts, including several ascomycete species
[16], the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica [9], the Oomycete
genus Phytophthora [17], amoeba from the genus Ent-
amoeba [18], the excavate Trichomonas vaginalis [19],
diatoms [20], the mosquito Aedes aegypti [21], and
the
trematode
Schistosoma
[22].
However,
MULEs
were detected in the animal kingdom only recently
[23, 24], and in general very little remains known
about MULEs from metazoan genomes [21, 22].
In common with other DNA transposons, MULEs
contain a DDE catalytic domain with structural features
in common with other Class II TEs and the integrase
domain of Class I LTR-retrotransposons [25]. The DDE
domain is typically more highly conserved than other
regions, and DDE sequences are often employed in
phylogenetic analyses [26]. Analyses across DNA TE di-
versity utilising the DDE domain have indicated that
MULEs share the closest relationship to P and hAT ele-
ments [26, 27]. Several phylogenetic analyses have also
attempted to reconstruct evolution within the MULE
superfamily [16, 18, 22, 24]. However, the most recent
consideration of MULE evolution was in 2011, where
the transposase amino acid sequences of just 39 MULE
elements from 26 host genomes resulted in the division
of the included sequences into 6 families (MuDR, TvCa-
MULE, Curupira, EMULE, Hop/Jittery, and Phantom)
[22]. Given the recent accumulation of genome sequen-
cing data, we revisit the question of MULE evolution.
We perform bioinformatic analyses to mine new mem-
bers of the MULE superfamily, and phylogenetic ana-
lyses to update and further investigate the evolutionary
history of this important group of DNA TEs.
Results and discussion
Using a series of genomic database searches, we recov-
ered 1631 autonomous Mutator-like elements (MULEs)
present in the genomes of hosts from 178 species, across
6 major groupings of eukaryotic life (animals, fungi,
amoeba, stramenopiles, parabasalids and plants). Based
on the results of our phylogenetic analyses (Additional
file 1), and the use of the ClusterPicker pipeline [28], we
divided MULE diversity into 50 major lineages, accord-
ing to the fixed criteria of strict monophyly, clade statis-
tical
support,
and
the
genetic
distance
between
sequences. During our database searches, we detected
several new groups of MULE elements, and a consider-
able number of new elements from invertebrate host ge-
nomes. We find that TE structure varies considerably
across MULE diversity, with elements differing in the
possession of additional zinc finger domains and DNA
inserts, and varying greatly in TIR length (14-500 bp)
and overall element length. Below we discuss our results,
and the insights they provide into MULE evolution, host
interactions, and MULE taxonomy.
Two novel MULE clades from invertebrate host genomes
We identify two new MULE clades that we name
Ghost and Spectre which contain 16 and 53 novel
MULE sequences respectively, from the genomes of
host species in 15 insect and arachnid genera (see
Groups 7 and 8, Additional file 1). One of these new
clades, Ghost, also includes four sequences from cni-
darian genomes.
All sequences in the
Ghost and
Spectre clades were recovered by BLAST searches,
using the transposase sequence of a newly identified
Spectre element as a query, except the 3 cnidarian se-
quences that were recovered by PSI-BLAST searches
Dupeyron et al. Mobile DNA           (2019) 10:12

using the transposase sequence of MuDR-1_NV (see
Methods).
The Ghost clade contains sequences mined from the
genomes of the following aphid and spider species: pea
aphid Acyrtosiphon pisum, green peach aphid Myzus per-
sicae, black cherry aphid Myzus cerasi, common house
spider Parasteatoda tepidariorum, and African velvet so-
cial spider Stegodyphus mimosarum. Since the date of
the most recent common ancestor of insects and arach-
nids is very deep (~ 500-600MYA) [29], and the most re-
cent common ancestor of arthropods and cnidarians (i.e.
Protostomia and Deuterostomia) is considerably more
ancient, this host distribution pattern implies that at
least one horizontal transfer event of Ghost elements has
occurred within the clade, and across major branches of
host diversity. Further, given that Ghost spider MULEs
(from S. mimosarum and P. tepidariorum) are nested
within a Ghost clade containing 11 aphid MULEs, it is
likely that there have been further horizontral transmis-
sion events between arachnids and insects. Aphids and
spiders occupy a shared environment and have a close
ecological relationship, and potential horizontal trans-
mission events may have occurred via a mechanism
through predation for example [30–32]). A transmission
route linking echinoderms and arthropods is less obvi-
ous, however, the relatively short branch length between
MULEs from these taxa is otherwise hard to explain
(Additional file 1). MULEs from additional host taxa that
provide a more obvious transmission route may be iden-
tified in the future. No complete Ghost elements were
recovered, and most elements in the clade were repre-
sented by a DDE domain only. No TIRs were detected,
and only three elements contain a zinc finger motif. The
most complete Ghost element originates from the gen-
ome of the black cherry aphid (M. cerasi), and is anno-
tated in Fig. 1a. This element contains two open reading
frames: a 420 bp ORF containing a RING zinc finger do-
main, and a truncated 1120 bp ORF containing the
transposase. Despite its truncated transposase ORF, the
DDE domain does not contain stop codons and aligns
well with other sequences employed in phylogenetic ana-
lyses. However, neither TIRs nor TSDs for this element
could be identified. It is possible that this apparent lack
of TIRs and TSDs may result from sequencing errors,
since the M. cerasi genome sequence is still provisional,
and the scaffold containing the most complete Ghost
element is very short, at just 4918 bp in length. The
remaining Ghost elements from aphid genomes were
also found in short scaffolds (Additional file 2: Table S2),
which appear to represent repeat rich regions where suc-
cessive elements have inserted into each other. Dis-
counting sequencing issues, Ghost MULEs may either
represent an additional group of non-TIR MULEs (see
below), or an old and no longer active MULE family

where TIRs and TSDs have degraded. If the latter is the
case, the intact DDE domains of these sequences may
argue for their domestication for host purposes, other-
wise it is unclear why other structural features should
have been degraded but the DDE domain retained.
Elements in the Spectre clade were identified in the
same host genomes as Ghost elements, with the excep-
tion of the black cherry aphid (M. cerasi) and the cnidar-
ian hosts, and the addition of a number of arthropod
hosts: three aphid species (greenbug Schizaphis grami-
num, Russian wheat aphid Diuraphis noxia, yellow sug-
arcane aphid Sipha flava), three true bugs (marmorated
stink bug Halyomorpha halys, brown planthopper Nila-
parvata lugens, silverleaf whitefly Bemisia tabaci), three
beetles (mountain pine beetle Dendroctonus ponderosae,
Colorado potato beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata, red
flour beetle Tribolium castaneum), and the Arizona bark
scorpion
(Centruroides
sculpturatus).
One
complete
Spectre element was identified, which originated from
the genome of the green peach aphid (M. persicae). The
complete element contains two ORFs, consisting of a
C2H2 zinc finger domain and a transposase, and two
perfect 74 bp TIRs, each flanked by an 8 bp TSD (please
see annotation in Fig. 1b). The discovery of an intact
transposase sequence and perfect TIRs and TSDs in
Spectre suggests that this family is still active. Identifica-
tion of a clade of closely related Spectre elements with
short terminal branch lengths in the genome of the
Colorado beetle (L. decemlineata), suggests this genome
may contain a currently active group of elements,
although we were unable to detect a fully complete
Spectre sequence in this host.
Our analyses greatly expand the number of known in-
vertebrate genomes that host MULE elements. Further,
given the distribution of hosts observed in the Ghost
and Spectre clades, we suggest that many more MULEs
may await discovery in diverse arthropod genomes. Con-
sequently, we anticipate that understanding of the host
range and evolution of these families will increase con-
siderably over coming years, as increasing numbers of
invertebrate genomes are screened for transposons.
Evolution and host range of MULEs
In line with previous studies, we identified MULE ele-
ments in the genomes of 6 diverse groups of eukaryotic
life: animals, fungi, amoeba, stramenopiles, parabasilids,
and plants. Such a wide diversity of distantly related
hosts, alongside the observed branching pattern between
host groups (Additional file 1), suggests a history of re-
peated horizontal transfer for MULEs. While once con-
sidered rare, horizontal transfer has recently become
established as a strong force in shaping the distribution
and evolution of TEs [33]. Our phylogeny, where high
clade support unites hosts from diverse origins, suggests
a tendency for certain MULEs to jump between hosts
from distantly related branches of the tree of life, such
as stramenopiles and platyhelminthes (group 16), stra-
menopiles, arthropoda and tunicata (group 20), and stra-
menopiles, plants and fungi (group 35) (Additional file
1). Remarkably, this last group includes MULEs from
host species belonging to three different taxonomic
kingdoms. A shared environment and close ecological
associations may promote such groupings, for example,
in groups 44 and 50, Phytophthora are widespread fila-
mentous generalist plant pathogens that share an intim-
ate
relationship with
their
plant
hosts
[34], while
Chaetomium globossum (group 35) is a widespread fun-
gus that can colonise various habitats and cause oppor-
tunistic infections [35]. Similarly, a MULE previously
reported from the genome of a polydnavirus (viruses
injected into insect hosts by parasitic wasps to suppress
host immunity) [24], clusters closely with other MULEs
isolated from diverse invertebrate genomes (group 20,
Additional file 1), including the jewel wasp (Nasonia
vitripennis) and the red flour beetle (Tribolium casta-
neum), highlighting the potential role of viruses as vec-
tors for the horizontal transmission of transposons.
Several cases of the horizontal transfer of MULEs be-
tween plant hosts have also been suggested, including
rice and other grasses in the genus Setaria, and rice and
Old World bamboos [36]. Nevertheless, despite the close
relationships shared between elements in the above
mentioned host groups, and the apparent incongruence
in observed host phylogenetic relationships, it is prudent
to remain cautious when hypothesizing horizontal trans-
fer events until a larger number of eukaryotic genomes
have been screened for MULEs.
There are few instances of MULEs from non-plant ge-
nomes in the more derived clades of MULE phylogeny
(i.e. groups 36–49, Additional file 1). In the very few
cases where non-plant MULE lineages do occur among
more derived clades, they exist as isolated lineages, and
are restricted to the plant parasite Phytophthora and one
instance of the platyhelminth Schmidtea (groups 39 and
50, and the isolated taxon 40 MuDR-4_SM, Additional
file 1). Thus, more derived MULE clades contain ele-
ments that are generally restricted to plant host ge-
nomes, perhaps reflecting a fundamental difference in
the biochemistry of transposition for this group of ele-
ments in plants, or differing defence mechanisms against
MULE transposons. In more basal clades, MULEs are
typically distributed according to host group, either at a
general level, or as radiations of elements restricted to
individual host species or genera (e.g. group 1 and 12
Trichomonas, group 13 Entamoeba, group 19 Mollusca,
group 21 to 34 Trichinella, Additional file 1). A cartoo-
nised depiction of MULE phylogeny (Fig. 2), highlights
the alternating associations of MULE elements among
Dupeyron et al. Mobile DNA           (2019) 10:12 
Page 4 of 14
host groups across phylogeny, with the exception of
more derived clades, which as mentioned above, contain
elements almost exclusively originating from plant host
genomes.
We find limited evidence for the existence of MULEs
in chordates, with the exception of one sequence from
the Pacific transparent sea squirt (Ciona savigny). The
presence of MULES in the genomes of the Florida lance-
let Branchiostoma floridae and horse Equus caballus
were previously reported [24], yet while an amino acid
alignment was provided for a FLYWCH zinc finger, none
were provided for the transposases of these elements,
and we were unable to detect evidence of MULE trans-
posases in the nucleic acid sequences provided for these
taxa,
or
during
independent
database
searches.
In
Repbase, 9 reports of MuDR elements exist from verte-
brate host genomes, 6 of which originate from the gen-
ome of the zebrafish Danio rerio and 3 from the
genomes of placental mammals. However, of these 9 re-
ports,
only
3
are
listed
as
autonomous
elements
(MuDR-1_DR, MuDR-2_DR, MuDR-3_DR) [37], their
ORFs are extremely fragmented, and we were not able
to detect a match between these sequences and MULE
transposases. Moreover, we were not able to align the
above mentioned protein sequences to our mutator
alignment (Additional file 3), strongly suggesting that
these supposedly vertebrate MULE sequences are in fact
mis-identified. Consequently, the identity of the 4750
MuDR elements listed from the zebrafish and those
from Eutherian genomes [38–41] require re-evaluation.
A striking observation from our analyses is that, with
the exception of plant MULEs (which are mainly found
in crops and other cultivated species), many of the ge-
nomes that contain MULE elements belong to parasitic/
pathogenic species that either attack plants (e.g. insects,
fungi and the Oomycete Phytophthora) or animals (e.g.
diverse eukaryote groups including: Schistosoma, Tricho-
monas, Nasonia, Lepeophtheirus, Trichinella, Candida).
A potential explanation for this pattern is a bias in se-
quencing effort directed towards parasitic species, due
to their important impacts on health or agriculture.
However, several alternative hypotheses may explain the
potential increased load or activity of MULEs in parasite
genomes [42–44]. For example, the genomes of parasitic
Phytophthora and fungal pathogens are often consider-
ably larger than those of non-parasitic stramenopiles
and fungi, and their genome expansions are typically a
consequence of increases in TE copy number [45]. Add-
itionally, the hypothesis of “two-speed genomes” in fila-
mentous
plant
pathogens
suggests
that
repeat-rich
regions of the genome evolve quickly, facilitating new
regulatory
functions
and
rearrangements
that
can

enhance parasite adaptation to host defences, whereas
gene-rich regions evolve more slowly [43]. Under this
hypothesis, the success of MULEs in Phytophthora spe-
cies (especially P. infestans), and the fungi Puccinia gra-
minis and Fusarium oxysporum could be facilitated by a
decreased stringency towards suppressing TE mobility.
Similar processes may be applicable to parasitic insects,
such as the peach potato aphid and Colorado potato
beetle, which are globally important pests of crops [46,
47]. Selection for novel resistance mutations has been
intense in many insect species over recent decades, fol-
lowing the extremely high exposures to insecticides ex-
perienced
by
many
insect
populations
globally.
Indeed, the role of successive TE insertions in pro-
moting increased host insecticide resistance via the
evolution of genomic novelty has been documented in
Drosophila [48].
An interesting and diagnostic feature of MULEs is
their unusually long TIRs [2]. As mentioned above, TIRs
in MULEs vary greatly in length, and elements included
in our analysis possess TIRs between 14 and 500 bp. Fur-
thermore, this variation appears to be independent of
phylogeny (Table 1, Additional file 1). It is not currently
clear why such great variation exists in TIR length
within and between MULE groups over phylogeny. TIRs
contain promoters that trigger transcription of the trans-
posase [49], and so are important for basic transposon
functioning. However, it has been suggested that TIRs
may be used by host genomes to distinguish between
host genes and those of genomic parasites (given read-
through transcription of TEs resulting in fold-back at
TIRs to form hairpin double stranded RNA structures)
[50]. Indeed, long MULE TIRs are known to be associ-
ated with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and TIR loss
is suggested to present a potential mechanism for escape
from siRNA-based silencing [51]. Consequently, differing
intensities of host-transposon co-evolutionary dynamics
may provide a potential explanation for widespread vari-
ation observed in MULE TIR length, if this offers an al-
ternative
and
less
dramatic
means
of
temporarily
evading host detection than total loss of TIRs.
MULE taxonomy
Progress in genome sequencing and the resultant emer-
gence of new elements has outpaced evolutionary ana-
lyses of MULEs over recent years, resulting in several
inconsistencies in MULE taxonomy. With reference to
our phylogenetic analysis, which partition MULE diver-
sity into a series of highly supported major MULE clades
(Additional file 1), below we provide suggestions aimed
at improving the clarity of MULE taxonomy.
Phantom is a structurally variable MULE family de-
scribed from a diverse set of eukaryotic host taxa [24].
We included 13 canonical Phantom sequences [24] in
our analysis. Our results strongly suggest that a sup-
posed element from the genome of the pathogenic yeast
Candida albicans (Additional file 1, group 2), should be
excluded from the Phantom family. The C. albicans
element is the sister taxa to elements from the Platyhel-
minth Schistozomas and is separated from all other
Phantom elements by several clades containing se-
quences from diverse host species. Remaining Phantom
elements occur in 3 highly supported clades, broadly de-
fined by host species, as follows: group 17, 23 Phy-
tophthora elements; group 18, 32 Trichomonas vaginalis
elements; group 20, 10 elements from various inverte-
brate hosts; and group 21, an isolated sequence from
Trichinella spiralis (MULE-Ts_1). MULEs in group 17
from Phytophthora occur alongside many MuDRx ele-
ments from P. infestans. The original MuDRx element
was detailed in a RepBase report in 2009 [52], ahead of
the description of Phantom elements [24], so we suggest
that it is preferable to maintain the name MuDRx for
the family of elements represented by group 17. Ele-
ments in group 18 exist only from T. vaginalis, and
since Phantom was described as a group of MULEs
widely distributed in animals, it seems more appropriate
to reserve the name for group 20 and reassign group 18
an alternative name, and so we refer to it here as
MULE-Tv. Phantom elements in group 20 occur along-
side “Muta” elements described from the tiger mosquito
Aedes aegypti [21]. Muta elements were described re-
cently [21], and so Phantom has priority as a name for
this family of elements, and we suggest maintaining the
status of group 20 as the Phantom family. Given that
group 21 represents a single MULE sequence from T.
spiralis we name it MULE-Ts_1.
Issues relating to the nomenclature of several plant
MULE clades are apparent. Jittery, described in maize,
occurs together with a MUJITOS2 element from rice
(Oryza sativa), a MUMET1 element from barrelclover
(Medicago truncatula), a MUTRIM1 element from ein-
korn wheat (Triticum monococcum) and multiple MuDR
elements from both monocotyledonous and dicotyledon-
ous host plant genomes (group 36, Additional file 1).
With reference to MULE phylogeny (Additional file 1),
it is apparent that these lineages occur as part of a larger,
highly-supported clade of plant MULEs (group 36) in-
cluding Jittery, which has the unusual transposition be-
haviour of apparent excision without reinsertion [53].
MUDRAVI elements constitute a polyphyletic group
represented
by
clades
including
the
elements
MUDRAVI1 and MUDRAVI2 (groups 49 and 50 respect-
ively, Additional file 1). The MUDRAVI2 group (group
49) contains elements extracted from the grape vine
(Vitis vinifera) genome, and many sequences from di-
cotyledonous plant genomes, whereas the MUDR group
(group 50), contains elements extracted from a wide

sequence
from
white
jute
(Chorcorus capsularis), ATMU from Arabidopsis, SHA-
MUDRA from the barrelclover, and several sequences
from cereals, among them OSMU and RMU1A23 from
rice. We named this clade MUDR (from maize) as it is
the oldest element with a specific name in this group.
We find support for the existence of a clade contain-
ing multiple VANDAL elements (group 45, Additional
file 1). VANDAL elements are notable TEs since they are
apparently autonomous but appear to either totally lack
or have short degenerate terminal inverted repeats
(TIRs), and were the first non-TIR autonomous DNA
TEs described in eukaryotes [51]. A transposition mech-
anism that does not require TIRs may provide an effi-
cient means to avoid host genomic defences against TE
mobility [10]. The anti-silencing protein VANC may be
involved in such a mechanism, as it induces hypomethy-
lation of these elements, facilitating their transcription
[54]. The original VANDAL element was described from
Arabidopsis [51], but it occurs together with elements
from other Brassicaceae plant genomes (group 45, Add-
itional file 1 and Table 1), some of which do contain
TIRs, suggesting a potential later evolutionary switch to
a non-TIR based mechanism of transposition.
Origin of MULES and relationship to Rehavkus elements
If the MULE superfamily is considered to exclude
Rehavkus elements, the host of the earliest branching
MULE clade is the parabasalid excavate Trichomonas
vaginalis, while the next earliest branching clade in-
cludes elements from the platyhelminth Schmidtea med-
iterranea and the oomycote stramenopile Phytophthora
infestans. However, if Rehavkus is considered to be a
MULE family, a metazoan origin for the entire group is
more plausible, given that Rehavkus is restricted to in-
sect and annelid worm hosts (Additional file 1, Table 1).
To date, very few Rehavkus elements have been identi-
fied and known elements are described in Repbase only
[55]. The structure of Rehavkus elements is similar to
that
of
MULEs,
except
for
the
presence
of
a
mini-satellite sequence prior to the 3′ TIR and the pos-
session of a PHD finger in the transposase domain (Add-
itional file 4: Table S1). In a broad-scale phylogenetic
analysis examining the phylogenetic relationships of
the catalytic domain of all eukaryotic cut-and-paste
transposase
superfamilies,
Rehavkus
elements
were
lumped together with MULEs, on the basis of several
conserved residues in the DDE domain, similar length
TIRs, and especially their shared long TIRs which are
a particular feature of some MULEs [26].
Conclusions
MULEs are important TEs due to their high activity rates,
bias toward inserting close to genes, and applications in
genetic research [2, 7, 56]. MULEs are also notable for
their structural variability, including their frequent take up
of foreign DNA and highly variable TIRs, and because of
the unusual transposition behaviour displayed by mem-
bers including VANDAL [2, 53, 57]. Recent years have
seen a great increase in the diversity of MULE elements
and their known hosts, particularly outside of plants, and
evidence now exists that is suggestive of a history of fre-
quent host switching across phylogeny [21, 22]. Conse-
quently, MULEs offer considerable promise as a model
DNA TE
system
for
varied
research
questions
in
host-transposon co-evolutionary interactions.
Our phylogenetic analyses divide MULE diversity into
a number of major families, and we identify several new
MULE clades, greatly expanding knowledge of elements
from arthropod hosts in particular. Our results suggest
that MULEs are more prevalent outside of plant hosts,
which are traditionally considered as their focal host
group. Due to the lack of recent evolutionary analyses,
our findings significantly increase understanding of
MULE diversity and evolution. Given our findings, it is
likely that many more MULE elements await discovery,
both in plants and in their other hosts. Hence, to facili-
tate future research on MULEs, we propose an updated
taxonomic context for partitioning MULE diversity.
Many fundamental questions concerning MULE biol-
ogy remain to be addressed. These include: (i) Are
MULEs over represented in the genomes of parasitic
species, or is this an artifact based on sequencing bias?
(ii) What is the biochemical and evolutionary signifi-
cance of the apparent hard division between MULEs in
plants and MULEs in other host groups? (iii) To what
extent is the apparent pattern of horizontal transmission
across highly divergent host groups a real feature of
MULE biology, which is upheld given increased taxo-
nomic sampling? (iv) Which vectors represent the main
vehicles for the horizontal transfer of MULEs, and par-
ticularly, do viruses represent a common route of trans-
fer between host taxa? (v) What is the evolutionary
significance of the often extremely long and highly vari-
able TIRs of MULEs? (vi) Are MULEs really absent from
vertebrate genomes, or have they been excluded from
hosts beyond the shallower clades of chordate phyl-
ogeny? (vii) How can the extraction of phylogenetic in-
formation from MULEs be improved, in order to
maximise phylogenetic signal and minimise noise, and
thus enable elucidation of the deeper nodes of MULE
phylogeny? Tackling these questions will lead to signifi-
cant improvements in our understanding of MULE
biology and the forces that shape host-transposon inter-
actions more widely.

Methods
Retrieval of MULE elements
We discovered an unknown TE sequence in the genome
of the green peach aphid Myzus persicae which we name
Spectre. Spectre shared features in common with Muta-
tor-like elements (MULEs), with 8 bp TSDs and 74 bp
TIRs, and it clustered firmly in the middle of known
MULE phylogeny. Consequently, Spectre was used to
search genomes present in the online aphid genome
database AphidBase, using BLASTn and BLASTx to
identify related sequences. The following aphid genome
releases were searched (representing the most recent re-
leases in each case at the time of searching): Acyrtosi-
phon
pisum,
genome
v2,
Aphis
glycines
genome,
Diuraphis noxia genome 1.0, Myzus cerasi genome v1.1,
Myzus persicae Clone G006 assembly v2 and Ropalosi-
phum padi genome v1.0. These searches revealed that
additional elements closely related to Spectre were
present in the M. persicae genome, the Acyrtosiphon
pisum genome, and in the M. cerasi genome. After
searching available aphid databases, we performed an ex-
tensive search for elements similar to Spectre using
BLASTn and BLASTx queries on NCBI GenBank,
retaining all hits with ≥50% identity that were ≥50% of
the length of the query sequence.
To collect known MULEs for a comprehensive bioinfor-
matic review of the Mutator superfamily, we performed
text searches of NCBI GenBank using common abbrevia-
tions for MULEs (e.g. MuDR, Mutator, Mule, Mu), retain-
ing any elements containing complete or near complete
transposase domains. Additionally, we downloaded amino
acid sequences for all autonomous eukaryote MULEs
available in Repbase [58]. We also downloaded sequences
for MULE transposons described in the supplementary in-
formation of relevant publications and elements corre-
sponding to these articles from Genbank [9, 18, 21, 22,
24]. Lastly, elements were included from another article
on request [26]. After assembling a wide range of MULE
sequences, we performed a phylogenetic analysis and
identified a large number of highly supported monophy-
letic MULE clades. Using one sequence per clade as a
query in turn, we then performed successive BLASTn,
BLASTx, tBLASTn, and PSI-BLAST searches on NCBI
GenBank to identify further MULE sequences, as well as
BLASTx and tBLASTx searches on two other databases:
Ensembl Genomes [59] and FlyBase [60].
In this study we focus analyses on MULE elements
from eukaryote genomes. Insertion sequence elements
(IS elements) in prokaryotic genomes with similarity to
MULE transposases are known (i.e. the IS256 group),
however,
these
are
considered
distantly
related
to
eukaryotic MULEs, which form a well-supported mono-
phyletic group to the exclusion of MULE-like insertion
sequences in phylogenetic analyses [18, 22].
Annotation of retrieved elements
Retrieved elements were annotated with Artemis soft-
ware [61], using the ORFfinder and BLASTx tools on
NCBI for conserved domains, and the Palindrome ana-
lyser tool of DNA Analyser to find TIRs [62]. Motifs
such as zinc finger domains were identified using
MOTIF
(https://www.genome.jp/tools/motif/)
or
the
BLASTp option of ORFfinder.
Phylogenetic analyses
In total, amino acid sequences for 1631 MULEs were
collected (for details see Table 1 and Additional file 4:
Table S1). For phylogenetic analyses we focussed on the
transposase domain, since this is the only highly con-
served region of DNA TEs. Transposase domains were
aligned using Muscle [63], using the profile alignment
option and the DDE domain alignment of Yuan & Wess-
ler 2011 [26], as a basis for alignment. The alignment
was manually curated using MEGA v7 [64] and Gen-
eious v11.1.4 [65]. We used members of the Rehavkus
TE group as an outgroup to root our phylogeny, since
these are closely related to canonical MULEs [26]. Some
MULE elements from Repbase did not align to other se-
quences, and were consequently not considered as
MULE elements and were not included in phylogenetic
analyses (see Additional file 3).
To infer the evolutionary history of MULEs, we used
PartitionFinder2 [66] to identify the best fitting amino acid
evolution
model
for
our
alignment,
followed
by
a
maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis with IQ-tree
[67]. The selected model of amino acid evolution was VT
+ G and we performed 1000 bootstrap repetitions [68].
Following phylogenetic analysis, ClusterPicker [29]
was used to infer phylogenetic clusters based on boot-
strap support values and genetic distance. Both the ini-
tial
and
main
bootstrap
support
thresholds
were
specified as 80%. We examined a range of genetic dis-
tance thresholds from 1.5 to 4.5% (covering the range of
suggested settings in ClusterPicker [29]), at an interval
of 0.1%. Following this, a graph of the relationship be-
tween the number of clusters inferred and the applied
genetic distance threshold was examined (Additional file 5).
With reference to group delineation, there is a first major
decrease in the number of identified clades when applying
a 3.6% sequence distance threshold. There is a subsequent
major decrease at a threshold of 3.8%, and a final major
decrease at a threshold of 4.2%, before the pattern plateaus
out at 10 very large inferred groups. We chose to adopt
the 3.6% threshold since this delineates clades at a rela-
tively inclusive level (avoiding excessive splitting), and is
most consistent with previously identified clades and pat-
terns in TE host range. However, we include trees for each
threshold at 0.1% increments between 2.6–4.2% for refer-
ence (Additional file 6).

MULE taxa in Additional file 1 were colour labelled
according to host taxonomy (at the level of phyla or
similar) in FigTree v1.4 (tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/fig-
tree/). Clade names correspond to the host taxonomic
group that they belong to, or to the first described
MULE in the literature for taxa including more than one
element (e.g. Jittery, group 36).
Sequences of the newly identified elements in the
Ghost and Spectre clades have been deposited in Gen-
Bank, with the following accession numbers: Ghost:
MH937730 and Spectre: MH937731. Records for these
elements will also be deposited into the online repeat
database RepBase.

Additional file 1: Phylogenetic tree of the amino-acid DDE transposase
domain of 1631 autonomous Mutator-like elements. The tree results from
a phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood inference, with 1000
bootstrap repetitions. Clade support values above 0.75 are indicated
adjacent to each clade. Clades are divided into groups, as indicated by
alternate shading, with a corresponding clade name and number to the
right. For each clade (except eight groups for which we only recovered
the amino acid transposase domain), a schematic summarising the
structure of the TEs contained within each group is illustrated, with
structural features represented by different coloured rectangles (please
see the accompanying key). Elements are named according to their
Repbase or Genbank ID, or according to the name provided in the article
describing them. The host genome for each element is indicated to the
right hand side of its ID, and labels are coloured broadly according to the
taxonomic kingdom that the species belongs to: blue for Metazoa, purple
for Excavates (Parabasalids), taupe for Oomycetes and Diatoms
(Stramenopiles), black for Amoebozoa, orange/yellow for Fungi, and
green for Plantae. Family-level groupings for MULE clades consisting of
≥2 elements are indicated with right curly braces. When more than one
schematics represent the structure of the elements within a clade, dotted
lines indicate which elements the schematic depicts. The alignment used
