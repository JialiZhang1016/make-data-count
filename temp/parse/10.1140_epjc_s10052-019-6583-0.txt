Abstract
Measurements of the π±, K ±, and proton double
differential yields emitted from the surface of the 90-cm-long
carbon target (T2K replica) were performed for the incoming
31 GeV/c protons with the NA61/SHINE spectrometer at the
CERN SPS using data collected during 2010 run. The dou-
ble differential π± yields were measured with increased pre-
cision compared to the previously published NA61/SHINE
results, while the K ± and proton yields were obtained for
the ﬁrst time. A strategy for dealing with the dependence
of the results on the incoming proton beam proﬁle is pro-
posed. The purpose of these measurements is to reduce sig-
niﬁcantly the (anti)neutrino ﬂux uncertainty in the T2K long-
baseline neutrino experiment by constraining the production
of (anti)neutrino ancestors coming from the T2K target.

Proton Synchrotron (SPS). The NA61/SHINE collabora-
tion is pursuing several physics goals including hadron pro-
duction measurements for T2K (Tokai to Kamioka) [2] –
an accelerator-based long-baseline neutrino experiment in
Japan. The NA61/SHINE measurements are used to reduce
the systematic uncertainties associated to the prediction of
the (anti)neutrino ﬂuxes in T2K. New measurements of π±,
K ± and p yields coming from the surface of the T2K replica
target are presented here. These results aim at reducing the
T2K (anti)neutrino ﬂux uncertainties down to a 3–4% level.
They can further be used to tune hadron interaction and trans-
port models.
The paper is structured as follows: a motivation for these
hadron measurements is ﬁrst presented. In Sect. 2, a brief
overview of the NA61/SHINE setup is shown followed by
the description of the analysis in Sect. 3. Section 4 gives a
concise description of all systematic uncertainties. Results
and comparison with Monte Carlo (MC) models and with
the previous NA61/SHINE measurements are presented in
Sect. 5. Finally, in Sect. 6, proper usage of these results in
the T2K neutrino beam simulation is discussed, followed by
a short conclusion.
1.1 The T2K neutrino beam
The T2K neutrino beam is produced at the Japan Proton
Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) [3] by directing a
30 GeV (kinetic energy) proton beam towards a 90-cm-long
graphite target. Produced mesons, mostly pions and kaons
[4], are focused by a set of three magnetic horns [2] and decay
to neutrinos in the decay volume. Focusing horns are alu-
minum conductors that create a toroidal magnetic ﬁeld with
respect to the beam direction. The polarity of the current in
the horns can be changed, so positively or negatively charged
pions (kaons) can be focused. In this way, T2K can produce
either a neutrino-enhanced (νμ) or an antineutrino-enhanced

(¯νμ) beam. Since direct hadron production measurements in
situ are not possible, Monte Carlo models are used to pre-
dict the (anti)neutrino ﬂuxes at the T2K near and far detec-
tors. However, signiﬁcant differences between hadron pro-
duction models induce considerable systematic uncertainties
on the (anti)neutrino ﬂuxes. Without any experimental data
to constrain the hadron production models, these system-
atic uncertainties would be larger than 25%. For this reason,
T2K uses available hadron production measurements, but
mostly relies on dedicated NA61/SHINE hadron production
data [4].
1.2 The NA61/SHINE measurements for T2K
The NA61/SHINE experiment took data for T2K in 2007,
2009 and 2010. In 2007 and 2009, measurements were per-
formed with a 30.92 GeV/c proton beam and a 2-cm-thick
carbon target (4% of a nuclear interaction length, λi) to
measure hadron multiplicities (π±, K ±, p, K 0
s , Λ) and the
production cross section [5–8]. Production events represent
the fraction of inelastic events in which at least one new
hadron in the ﬁnal state is produced. By using these mea-
surements, the uncertainty on the neutrino ﬂux in T2K was
reduced to about 10% [4]. However, the hadron production
component of the uncertainty still dominated the total uncer-
tainty due to the insufﬁcient precision of the production cross
section measurements and re-interactions inside the target
and aluminum horns, which cannot be directly constrained
by the measurements of the primary proton-carbon interac-
tions. To further reduce the hadron production uncertainty
of the neutrino ﬂux, hadron production measurements with
a replica of the T2K target were needed. Measurements with
the T2K replica target can directly constrain up to 90% of
the neutrino ﬂux because hadron yields at the surface of
the target are measured not just for primary interactions,
but also for re-interactions inside the target [9]. These mea-
surements were also done in 2007, 2009 and 2010. Mea-
surements from the 2007 run [9] were used as a proof-of-
principle, while measurements from the 2009 run [10,11]
are being incorporated in the T2K neutrino ﬂux simulation.
The expected (anti)neutrino ﬂux uncertainty is around 5%
[12], representing a signiﬁcant improvement with respect to
the previously published uncertainty of 10%. Measurements
from the 2010 run are the main topic of this paper. With
respect to the previous results, these measurements of π±
yields have smaller statistical and systematic uncertainties.
Furthermore, K ± and p yields are measured for the ﬁrst time.
This is expected to further reduce the uncertainties on the
(anti)neutrino ﬂuxes in T2K from about 10% down to the
level of 3–4%. Moreover, since (anti)neutrino ﬂuxes in T2K
in the energy region above ∼2 GeV are produced mainly by
kaon decays, the corresponding uncertainties will be greatly
reduced.
1.3 The T2K requirements
T2K imposes strict requirements on hadron production mea-
surements with the T2K replica target [10]. Hadron yields
mustbemeasuredasafunctionofthemomentum,polarangle
and longitudinal position of the hadron exit point on the tar-
get surface. In other words, vertices inside the target are not
reconstructed. Tracks measured in a detector are only extrap-
olated to the target surface. Essentially, the target is treated
as a black box and measured hadron yields are the sum of
yields coming from primary interactions and re-interactions.
In addition, T2K requires that the longitudinal position along
the target surface is binned in at least six bins: ﬁve longitu-
dinal bins 18 cm in size and the downstream target face as
a sixth bin [13]. Since the T2K target is inserted in the ﬁrst
focusing horn, hadrons coming from different parts of the tar-
get will have different paths through the magnetic ﬁeld and
they will be focused differently by the horns. The previous
NA61/SHINE measurements with 2007 and 2009 data have
already proven that the NA61/SHINE setup is suitable for
measuring hadron yields on the T2K replica target surface,
although the target is placed outside of the tracking system.
2 NA61/SHINE experimental setup
The NA61/SHINE setup during the T2K replica target data-
taking in 2010 consisted of ﬁve Time Projection Cham-
bers (TPCs), three Time-of-Flight walls (ToF-F, ToF-L and
ToF-R), three Beam Position Detectors (BPD-1, BPD-2,
BPD-3), a 90-cm-long graphite target, ﬁve scintillator coun-
ters and two Cherenkov detectors. Two of the vertex TPCs
(VTPC-1 and VTPC-2) are inside the magnetic ﬁeld created
by two superconducting magnets. For the study presented
here the magnetic ﬁeld of the dipole magnets was set to a
bending power of 1.14 Tm (standard magnetic ﬁeld), while
a small subset of data was also taken with the full magnetic
ﬁeld of 9 Tm. A schematic overview of the setup is presented
in Fig. 1. More details can be found in Ref. [1]. The coordi-
nate system is deﬁned as follows: the z-axis is in the nominal
direction of the beam, the x-axis in the horizontal plane is
such that positively charged particles are bent in the positive
x-direction, and the y-axis is perpendicular to the horizontal
plane and points upward. The origin is located in the centre
of the VTPC-2.
2.1 Beamline
The NA61/SHINE spectrometer [1] is served by the so-called
H2 beamline at the north area of the SPS. The beamline is
designed to transport both primary and secondary hadrons
and ions from the maximum SPS energy (400 GeV/c) down
to 13 A GeV/c. Secondary hadron beams of various momenta

are produced by impinging a primary 400 GeV/c proton beam
on a beryllium target. Produced hadrons are selected by two
spectrometers and a set of collimators according to their
rigidity (momentum to charge ratio). The secondary beam is
then transported towards NA61/SHINE. The beam is deﬁned
by three scintillator counters used in coincidence (S1, S2 and
S3) and two scintillator counters with holes used in antico-
incidence (V0 and V p
1 ). The S3 counter has a radius equal
to the target radius, and it was placed 0.5 cm upstream of
the target. The V0 counter has a 1 cm diameter hole cen-
tered on the beam axis, which allows the selection of a nar-
rower beam, if necessary. A Cherenkov Differential Counter
with Achromatic Ring Focus [14] (CEDAR) and Thresh-
old Cherenkov Counter (THC) were used in coincidence and
anti-coincidence respectively to identify beam particles. By
changing the gas pressure in these detectors, it is possible to
estimate the beam composition. The 30.92 GeV/c beam con-
tains around 76.3% π+, 1.6% K +, and 12% protons [13].
The estimated purity of the selected proton sample is better
than 99.9%. Finally, the beam position is measured by a set
of six multi-wire proportional chambers. Two chambers, one
measuring position along the x-axis and another measuring
the position along the y-axis, are part of one BPD. The pre-
cision of the position measurement in one BPD is around
200 µm [1].
The third BPD was mounted on the same support as the
target, just upstream of the S3 counter.
2.2 Target
The T2K target [2] has a modular structure which includes a
graphite core, a thin titanium case, cooling pipes ﬁlled with
helium. The replica target design matches dimensions and
material of the T2K graphite core. It was made of Toyo Tanso
IG-43 graphite [15]. The target density was estimated by
measuring its volume and mass, and it is equal to 1.83±0.03
g cm−3. This value is 1.5% higher than the density of the
T2K target, but well within the measurement uncertainty.
The target shape was machined to form a 2 cm thick disk
with an 88 cm long rod coming from its centre. The radii of
the disk and rod are 3.5 cm and 1.3 cm, respectively. The disk
was used to mount an aluminium ﬂange which was, in turn,
tightened to a target holder. The upstream side of the ﬂange
has a hole to minimize beam interactions with aluminium
and provide space for the S3 counter used in the trigger. A
schematic overview of the target can be seen in Fig. 2. The
position and tilt of the target were adjusted by the screws
on the target holder. The downstream face of the target was
placed around 67 cm from the upstream side of VTPC-1.

replica target with the upstream
ﬂange zoomed in is shown on

2.3 Tracking system
The tracking system consists of two Vertex TPCs located
in the magnetic ﬁeld with an additional small TPC called
the Gap TPC (GTPC) located between them, and two Main
TPCs (MTPC-L and MTPC-R), located downstream sym-
metrically with respect to the beamline. All TPCs were inher-
itedfromtheprevious NA49experiment [16]. TheGTPCwas
introduced in order to measure forward-going particles with
small polar angles, θ < 10 mrad, in the laboratory frame.
The magnetic ﬁeld was set so that the total bending power of
the magnets was 1.14 T m. This allowed a momentum resolu-
tion of σp/p2 = 5×10−3(GeV/c)−1, except for very forward
tracks that only passed through the GTPC and MTPCs and
had a momentum resolution of 22 × 10−3 (GeV/c)−1 [13].
The angular resolution is around 3–4 mrad and it does not
change much as a function of angle. The longitudinal posi-
tion resolution changes with angle. For angles around 20
mrad it is around 15 cm. For larger angles, it goes down to
around 2.5cm. Particles emitted from the downstream face
of the target behave differently. Forward going particles are
usually emitted from the center of the downstream target
face. Therefore, extrapolation usually works quite well in
this case. However, higher-angle particles coming from the
downstream face of the target are usually emitted closer to
the edge. In that case, migration effects increase.
The measured energy loss (dE/dx) in the TPCs provided
excellent particle identiﬁcation capabilities; the achieved res-
olution is around 4%. In the region where the energy loss
distributions for different particles cross, time-of-ﬂight mea-
surements (tof ) were used for particle identiﬁcation.
2.4 Time-of-ﬂight walls
Although the NA61/SHINE spectrometer has three different
Time-of-Flight (ToF) detectors, for the T2K replica target
measurements only the forward wall (ToF-F) was used for
particle identiﬁcation. The left and right walls (ToF-L and
ToF-R) have superior granularity, but their coverage is insuf-
ﬁcient.TheToF-Fwallwasconstructedin2007andupgraded
in 2009 for the T2K hadron production measurements. It
consists of 80 scintillator bars with dimensions W×H×L =
10 × 120 × 2.5 cm arranged in ten separate modules. The
signal is read out by two PMTs placed at both ends of the
bars. The estimated tof resolution was 115 ps [13].
2.5 Triggers
The proton beam proﬁle on target at NA61/SHINE is wider
than that at J-PARC. Previous studies [10] have shown that
longitudinal (z) distribution of the hadrons emitted from the
replica target surface depends on the width and position of
the incoming proton beam at the target upstream face. In the
simplest case where the beam has some radial distribution
and where beam divergence and possible re-interactions in
the target are neglected, a hadron, produced at position zi
along the target with polar angle θ and radial position Δr
with respect to the target longitudinal axis, would escape the
target at a minimal longitudinal position, z, given by:
z = zi + Δr
tan θ .
(1)
Evidently, for narrower beams, the longitudinal (z) distri-
bution of the hadrons exiting the target surface is pushed
more downstream. With a sufﬁciently narrow beam, one
can suppress the number of hadrons coming from the ﬁrst
18 cm of the target by an order of magnitude or more.
Although this effect seems to be purely geometrical, a Monte
Carlo simulation suggest that different beam widths and posi-
tions can lead to slightly different numbers of low momen-
tum pions produced in re-interactions. The difference in
the number of pions is around 1%. The NA61/SHINE pro-
ton beam achieved in 2009 [10] is much wider than the

and T2K beam proﬁles for two different runs (green). Beam proﬁles in
T2K change on a run-by-run basis and perfect agreement is not possible.
All distributions are normalised to the corresponding total number of
protons on target
J-PARC beam. To avoid large differences between the
NA61/SHINE beam and the J-PARC beam, four special trig-
gers were used during the 2010 data-taking (see Fig. 1):

The T1 trigger is the only trigger that selects beam protons
that did not necessarily hit the target or when a hit in the S3
scintillator was not detected. The T2 and T3 triggers select
only beam protons that hit the target. The only difference is
that T3 selects a narrower beam because the V0 counter has
a smaller hole. The fourth trigger selects all beam particles
that hit the target. It is important to note that T1, T2 and T4
were prescaled – only a fraction of them was recorded. The
prescaling was applied to T2 to achieve the desired radial
distribution of the beam. If an event is a T2 but not a T3, this
means that the triggered beam particle is in the tail of the
radial distribution on the upstream target face. To reduce the
beam tail, only one out of two such events was registered.
The achieved radial distribution is shown in Fig. 3. Perfect
agreement with the T2K beam proﬁle is not possible since
in T2K the beam proﬁle changes on a run-by-run basis. Any
differences must be studied before using these measurements
in the T2K neutrino beam simulation. Such study is presented
in Sect. 6.
In total, 10.2×106 triggers were recorded. Around 11.7%
of the triggers were recorded with the maximum magnetic
ﬁeld of 9 Tm. This allowed the recording of beam protons
that pass through the target without interacting and the mea-
surements of their parameters in the TPCs. However, all sec-
ondary hadrons below 6GeV/c were bent out of the TPCs and
did not reach the ToF-F wall. The analysis of data recorded
with the maximum magnetic ﬁeld is a subject of an indepen-
dent publication. In this paper, the data taken with the stan-
dard magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration (89.3% of triggers) were
analysed, while the high magnetic ﬁeld subset was used for
alignment between the BPDs and TPCs (see Sect. 3.1).
3 Analysis
The reconstruction and simulation procedures used for the
replica target analysis are described in earlier publications
[9,10].
The analysis of the data taken with the standard magnetic
ﬁeld conﬁguration was performed with the so-called tof -
dE/dx method, which makes use of the TPC measurements
ofthespeciﬁcenergyloss(dE/dx)andthetime-of-ﬂightmea-
surements [9,10]. The speciﬁc energy loss of a track is calcu-
lated as a truncated mean [16] of the charges of the clusters
(points) on the track traversing the TPCs. After event and
track selection, selected tracks were binned in momentum
(p), polar angle (θ), both measured in the laboratory frame,
and longitudinal position of the exit point on the target sur-
face (z), as required by T2K. The different hadron yields were
estimated by ﬁtting a two-dimensional dE/dx–m2
tof distribu-
tion for every bin. These raw yields were then corrected for all
inefﬁciencies by applying Monte Carlo and data-based cor-
rection factors. Before any event or track selection is applied,
it was necessary to determine the target position with respect
to the BPDs and TPCs in order to reﬁne the original surveyor
measurements.
3.1 Target position and alignment
The target upstream face x and y positions with respect to the
BPDs can be determined just by plotting the T2 beam proﬁle
at the target upstream z position. The position of the target
centre was obtained by maximising the number of entries in
the circle with radius equal to 1.3 cm. This was only possible
because S3 counter, which was part of the trigger, had the
same radius as the target and it was placed just upstream of
the target. The target upstream z position was measured by
surveyors before the data-taking. Once the relative alignment
of the target and BPDs was known, the alignment of the TPCs
with respect to the BPDs could also be determined. To do
so, the data taken with the high magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration
were used to select events with only one high momentum
track corresponding to the beam track. Those tracks were
extrapolated to the surveyed z position of the target using an
analytical method (see Ref. [17]) with error propagation that
accounts for multiple scattering (see Ref. [18]). The positions
of the beam tracks extrapolated forward from the BPDs and

Fig. 5 The distribution of z positions of closest approach for TPC
tracks extrapolated to the beam track. Only tracks whose distance to the
beam track is within extrapolation uncertainty were selected. The red
line shows ﬁtted rising edge and the position of the half maximum was
taken to be the target upstream z position
backward from the TPCs were compared and the mean value
of the differences was taken to be the misalignment of the
TPCs with respect to the BPDs (see Fig. 4).
Because of the non-negligible probability of re-interacti-
ons and long extrapolation distance, it is difﬁcult to recon-
struct interaction vertices in the target. However, by extrapo-
lating TPC tracks and selecting only those for which the point
of closest approach to the beam track is within the extrap-
olation uncertainty, it was possible to check the surveyors’
measurement of the target z position. The z distribution of
the points of closest approach was plotted and a rising edge
could be seen as shown in Fig. 5. The z position at the half-
max of this rising edge was taken to be the upstream target
face. Full agreement with the surveyor position measurement
was obtained.

The ﬁnal step was to determine the tilt of the target in x −z
and y −z planes. First, the target was assumed to be parallel
to the z-axis. Then, only events with beam tracks passing
through the whole length of the target were selected. The TPC
tracks were again extrapolated backwards until the minimum
distance from the beam track was reached. By plotting the
x and y distributions for 18 slices in z and checking the
width and position of the distributions, it is straightforward to
extract any possible tilt of the target. For example, if the target
is tilted in positive x direction, edges of the x distributions
would be shifted towards the centre because the target is
moved from the beam. The shift would increase with z. No
appreciabletiltwasfound.InTable1themeasuredpositionof

3.2 Event selection
Three different criteria were imposed on the recorded events.
Beam particles were required to hit the target, in other words,
an event must correspond to T2 or T3 trigger. Also, the posi-
tion of each beam particle must have been measured by all
three BPDs. And ﬁnally, the reconstructed path of the beam
particle must have passed through the whole length of the
target.
Only 75% of the events passed this selection. Events were
mostly discarded at the second requirement due to inefﬁcien-
cies in the BPD measurements. The event selection should

also ensure that events containing off-time TPC tracks were
not selected as these tracks can potentially bias the measured
hadron yields. The beam intensity during the data-taking was
around 8.3 kHz which means that the mean time difference
between beam particles was around 120 μs. However, the
ToF-F wall has a time acquisition window of 100 ns, and
because of the requirement that all tracks must have a tof hit
for particle identiﬁcation, most of the off-time TPC tracks
were automatically discarded. The fraction of accepted off-
time tracks was negligible.
3.3 Track selection
Track selection was rather simple and can be divided into two
parts. First, a track was required to have ﬁtted momentum,
energy loss, and time-of-ﬂight measurements. Afterwards,
cuts were applied to increase the quality of the selected
track sample. Tracks can have segments in different TPCs
and therefore, can be divided into different topologies. For
each topology, a different requirement on the number of clus-
ters was applied. For example, if a track passes through the
VTPCs, at least 25 points in the VTPCs were required. A cut
on the number of clusters in MTPCs was not applied to such
tracks.However,trackswithmomentummeasuredonlyinthe
GTPC have between four and seven GTPC points. At least
six points in the GTPC were required as well as additional 30
points in the MTPCs. This ensured that the track parameters
were measured with sufﬁcient precision and that the track did
not pass very close to the MTPC walls where possible ﬁeld
distortions are the largest. Afterwards, the azimuthal angle
distributions were plotted for polar angle intervals of 20 mrad
or 40 mrad. Two different types of azimuthal regions were
removed: the regions with rapidly changing acceptance and
the regions in which the Monte Carlo acceptance does not
correspond to the data. This may be caused by slightly dif-
ferent sizes of the TPCs or distortions of the magnetic ﬁeld
which are not present in the magnetic ﬁeld maps used in the
Monte Carlo simulation. The selected regions in (φ, θ) space
are presented in Fig. 6. This reduces the possibility of bias
once the Monte Carlo corrections were applied to the data.

Finally, the selected TPC tracks were extrapolated towards
thetargetsurface.Thetrackparametersandcovariancematri-
ces were saved for the positions where tracks hit the target
surface or the minimum distance from the target surface was
less than 3σR, where σR is the extrapolated radial uncer-
tainty. This cut reduced the number of selected tracks that
were not coming from the target, but were created in decays
or interactions outside of the target.
3.4 Phase space
Selected tracks were binned in (p, θ, z) space. As required
by T2K [10], six longitudinal bins in total were used: the
90-cm-long graphite rod was divided into ﬁve bins of 18 cm
each and the target downstream face was considered as an
additional sixth bin. Different (p, θ) binning was applied for
extracting π±, K ± and p yields. The reason for this is due to
statistics: several times fewer kaons than pions are expected,
so coarser binning must be used for kaons. Unequal bin sizes

Fig. 15 Beam slope dx/dz vs. x position (a) and dy/dz vs. y (b) for beam particles selected by the T2 trigger. The distributions are used to
randomly generate beam particles in the NA61/SHINE Monte Carlo simulation
[19–21]. Also, the starting value for the momentum binning
was carefully adjusted. The necessity for this comes from the
fact that the ToF-F response was not simulated in the Monte
Carlo. Instead, in the reconstruction chain applied to simu-
lated events the tof measurements were just assigned to the
tracks that hit the ToF-F wall, and later on the inefﬁciency of
the ToF-F wall was corrected with a data-based correction.
Actually, very low momentum particles, depending on their
mass, cannot reach the ToF-F wall within the ToF-F acqui-
sition window. Therefore, Monte Carlo corrections in this

of the x-coordinate. It is clear that the efﬁciency drops if the bar is closer
to the beamline (x = 0 cm). This is due to an increasing track density
with decreasing distance to the beam
region would be heavily biased. For example, momentum
bins for protons must start at 0.5 GeV/c.
The overall phase space binning covers more than 96%
of (anti)neutrinos crossing the T2K far detector (Super-
Kamiokande) which are produced by the charged hadrons
emitted from the target. More than 97% of (anti)neutrinos
produced by pions are covered, while the coverage drops
for kaons and protons. This is summarised in Table 2. The
phase space of the charged hadrons coming from the T2K
target surface that contribute to the (anti)neutrino ﬂuxes in
Super-Kamiokande are plotted in Figs. 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11.
The top row in each ﬁgure represents the coverage for the
forward horn current (FHC) corresponding to the neutrino
mode, while the bottom row represents the coverage for
the reverse horn current (RHC) corresponding to the anti-
neutrino mode. Each column represents a different longitu-
dinal bin. The phase space coverage of the measurements
presented in this paper is overlaid on top of the ﬁgures as
a black line. Since NA61/SHINE added new forward TPCs
in 2017 [22], possible future measurements could improve
coverage for the forward-going high momentum K ± and p
[23].
3.5 Particle identiﬁcation
Since large fractions of the phase space are covered, a robust
particle identiﬁcation method is needed. For the momen-
tum range between 1 GeV/c and 3 GeV/c (see Fig. 12), the
energy loss distributions cross, hence particle identiﬁcation
based on the energy loss alone is not possible. However,
in these regions, tof measurements can be used to distin-
guish between particles. Kaons can be separated easily up to
3 GeV/c, while protons can be separated up to 8 GeV/c, as
can be seen in Fig. 13. For higher momentum, the tof res-
olution becomes too poor, while energy loss measurements
allow for better identiﬁcation. It is clear that both approaches
are complementary and therefore they can be combined to
cover all the bins. The tof measurement was used to calcu-

tributed, as its distribution is similar to the Landau distribu-
tion. The measured dE/dx in NA61/SHINE is calculated as
a truncated mean (see Ref. [16]) of all energy depositions
for all clusters. Therefore, we assume that truncated mean is
normally distributed. This is only valid if all tracks have the

Fig. 21 Uncertainties on p yields shown as a function of p and θ: statistical uncertainties (top row), total systematic uncertainties (middle row)
and total uncertainties (bottom row). Each column corresponds to a different longitudinal bin
same number of TPC clusters. The selected tracks can have
a different number of clusters which can signiﬁcantly affect
the dE/dx resolution if the number of TPC clusters is small.
However, the dE/dx resolution in NA61/SHINE saturates at
around 3.5% for tracks with more than 70 clusters. Around
98.5% of the selected tracks have more than 70 clusters.
This is a good justiﬁcation for using only a single Gaussian
for describing energy loss in a single phase space bin for
one particle species. Our previous measurements prove this
assumption (see Refs. [8,10]). The total ﬁtting function was
constructed from four two-dimensional Gaussians, one for
each particle species (e±, π±, K ±, p (p)). The ﬁtting was
done in the RooFit framework [24] by using extended log-
likelihood minimization which treats the number of observed

Fig. 22 Systematic uncertainties for the measured yields as a function
of momentum. Each column corresponds to a different particle type,
from left to right: π+, π−, K +, K −, and p. Each row corresponds to
a different longitudinal bin. Speciﬁc theta ranges are given on top of
each plot. Presented (p, θ, z) bins are selected to show typical sizes of
the systematic uncertainties
particles as a Poisson random variable. An example of a ﬁt
is shown in Fig. 14. In total, there were 20 parameters in
the ﬁt: eight mean values, eight standard deviations, and four
particle multiplicities. The obtained raw multiplicities must
be corrected for various inefﬁciencies with Monte Carlo and
data-based corrections.
3.6 Monte Carlo correction factors
Interactions in the target were simulated by Fluka2011.2c.5
[19–21]. The kinematics of the particles at their exit posi-
tion on the surface of the target was then fed to Geant3
/GCALOR [25] for propagation through the NA61/SHINE
detector. The incoming proton beam information from the
data was used to generate the Monte Carlo beam proﬁle.
The beam track parameters for each simulated proton were
thrown randomly according to the beam divergence and posi-
tion distributions shown in Fig. 15. The x- and y- positions
and divergences were considered to be independent. In total,
nearly 40 × 106 protons on target (POT) were simulated.
A simple Monte Carlo correction was applied to the raw
yields:
Ci jk =
Ni jk
sim
Ni jk
rec,sim
,
(3)
where Ni jk
sim is the number of simulated hadrons in the bin
(p, θ, z) = (i, j, k) and Ni jk
rec,sim is the number of simulated
hadrons reconstructed in the same bin. This correction can
be separated into several factors, which allow for a better
determination of the associated systematic errors:
1
Ci jk
= εfeed-down
i jk
· εmig
i jk · εsel
i jk · εrec
i jk · εloss
i jk · εφ
i jk,
(4)
where εφ
i jk is the geometrical efﬁciency (because of the φ
cut), εloss
i jk is the hadron loss efﬁciency due to decays and
interactions in the detector (hadrons which are produced in
re-interactions and by chance extrapolated to the target sur-
face are included in this correction), εrec
i jk is the reconstruc-
tion efﬁciency, εsel
i jk is the selection efﬁciency, εmig
i jk is the
bin migration efﬁciency and εfeed-down
i jk
is the feed-down efﬁ-
ciency. The geometrical efﬁciency gives the percentage of 4π
solid angle covered by the NA61/SHINE detector after the
selection. Some of the produced hadrons inside the detec-
tor coverage can decay or re-interact in the detector and
therefore, they do not hit the TOF-F wall. The percentage
of surviving hadrons is given by the hadron loss efﬁciency.
The reconstruction efﬁciency is a convolution of the efﬁ-
ciency of software algorithms used for the reconstruction
and the efﬁciency of the detector. The selection efﬁciency
corrects for the hadrons lost in the quality selection. The
values of momentum (p), polar angle (θ) and longitudinal
position along the target surface (z) for each hadron are
reconstructed with ﬁnite precision. Consequently, some of
the hadrons will be placed in a wrong (p, θ, z) bin. The
ratio of the number of hadrons which are reconstructed in
a given bin to the number of hadrons which are simulated in
123

the same bin represents the migration efﬁciency. The feed-
down efﬁciency corrects for weak decays outside of the tar-
get whose decay products are extrapolated to the target sur-
face.
Although only the total Monte Carlo correction was
applied to raw yields, it was useful to study each contri-
bution separately in order to estimate possible biases. The
systematic uncertainties for each correction are presented in
the next section. As previously described, the efﬁciency of
the ToF-F detector was not included in the Monte Carlo cor-
rection.
3.7 ToF-F efﬁciency correction factors
A different track selection was used to estimate the ToF-F
efﬁciency from the data. Only tracks that reached the end of
the MTPCs were selected. Since the ToF-F wall was placed
just downstream of the MTPCs, it was necessary to make
sure that tracks did not re-interact or decay before hitting the
ToF-F wall. The efﬁciency of each scintillator bar was sim-
ply calculated as the number of tracks with hits in the ToF-F
wall divided by the total number of selected tracks. Inefﬁ-
ciency was caused mainly by two effects. First, if two tracks
hit a scintillator bar in the same event, the hit was discarded
during reconstruction since it was not possible to distinguish
between these tracks (close to the beamline there is a 4%
probability another track will be matched to the same ToF-F
hit, while this probability is below 1% further away from the
beamline). Second, a hit is also discarded if the difference
in time of ﬂight measured by the top and bottom PMTs in a
bar was larger than 2000 ps. During the data-taking period,
four scintillator bars had only one PMT working or there
was a DAQ problem for these channels. These scintillators
did not suffer from the inefﬁciency caused by the quality
cut during reconstruction. However, these bars had a worse
time resolution by a factor of
√
2. The efﬁciency of each
bar is shown in Fig. 16. Efﬁciency uncertainties were cal-
culated as binomial errors. This information was then used
to estimate the ToF-F efﬁciency for each phase space bin.
Tracks in a single bin usually contain hits in several scintil-
lators (usually around three or four). The error on the efﬁ-
ciency for each bin was taken as a ToF-F systematic uncer-
tainty.
3.8 Ad hoc correction factors
A 50% drop in the number of ToF-F hits in the data was
observed for a couple of upstream longitudinal bins and
high polar angle (θ ≈300 mrad). However, such a drop
was not seen in the MC simulation and could not be related
to the ToF-F inefﬁciency. Under further inspection, it was
discovered that the corresponding tracks actually did not
reach the MTPCs but were bent out or absorbed while pass-
ing very close to the edge of the magnetic ﬁeld map used
in the simulation. It is thus possible that the ﬁeld map in
this region is biased. It appears to be biased asymmetri-
cally as negatively-charged tracks were more affected than
positively-charged ones, pointing out to asymmetric E × B
corrections in the TPCs. Nevertheless, the affected bins rep-
resent only around 1% of the total π± bins and other hadrons
were not affected, since they were not measured in the
affected area because of the low statistics. To account for
this inefﬁciency, an additional ad hoc correction factor was
applied:

and Ctof
i jk is the ToF-F efﬁciency for the given phase space
bin. It is clear that this correction can be model-dependent
and therefore this point must be addressed for a possible sys-
tematic bias.
4 Systematic uncertainties
The systematic uncertainties of this analysis were carefully
studied. A brief summary is given below, while more detailed
information can be found in Ref. [13].
The following systematic uncertainties were considered:
(i) Hadron loss uncertainty. Apart from the ToF-F inefﬁ-
ciency, tracks can miss the ToF-F wall, re-interact in
the detector, or decay before reaching the end of the
MTPCs. Possible imperfections in the Monte Carlo
description of the detector can create biases while cor-
recting for the previously described effects. To check
for potential biases, an attempt to impose more strict
cuts and to select only tracks with a long segment in
the MTPCs was made. After re-calculating and com-
paring the yields to the standard results, the difference
was taken as a systematic uncertainty. In the majority
ofbins,thisuncertaintyiswellbelow1%.However,for
tracks with a momentum of several GeV/c in the 20–40
mrad region in the most upstream longitudinal bin, the
hadron loss uncertainty goes up to 20% (for a single
bin it reached 50%). These tracks cross the beamline
and pass very close to the walls of the MTPCs.
(ii) Backward track extrapolation (bin migration) uncer-
tainty.Theuncertaintyonthetargetpositioncaninduce
systematic bin migration while extrapolating tracks
backwards to the surface of the target. The position of
the target was changed in the Monte Carlo and hadron
123
Eur. Phys. J. C (2019) 79 :100
Page 17 of 45
100
yields were recalculated. Differences were taken as
systematic uncertainties. For tracks with a very small
angle originating from the ﬁrst two longitudinal bins,
this uncertainty goes up to 8%. Also, high angle tracks
extrapolated toward the downstream face of the target
are sensitive to the x and y shifts of the target, and for
them the bin migration uncertainty is up to 5%. For
all other regions of the phase space, the bin migration
uncertainty drops below 1%.
(iii) Reconstruction efﬁciency uncertainty. This uncer-
tainty was estimated in the previous NA61/SHINE
publications [8,10]. Since the experimental setup and
the reconstruction software did not change, the same
value was used for the measurements presented in this
paper. A conservative value of 2% is assigned for all
bins.
(iv) Particle identiﬁcation (PID) uncertainty. The width of
the energy loss distribution for a single bin depends
on the number of clusters in tracks. The energy loss
distribution should be a sum of Gaussians, where each
Gaussian represents tracks with a distinct number of
clusters. Selected tracks, in this case, are very long
and the width of the energy loss distribution becomes
nearly constant. For this reason, a single Gaussian was
used to describe the energy loss distributions. How-
ever, at higher momenta and, thus, for larger momen-
tum bins, the mean values will also shift and possibly
create an asymmetry in the distribution. To check for
potential biases, a sum of two Gaussians was used and
the obtained yields were compared. The mean values
of Gaussians were kept independent, while the width
of the second Gaussian was forced to be larger than
the width of the ﬁrst Gaussian. For low momentum, no
difference was found, however, for higher momentum
and larger bins, a difference of up to 1% was observed
for π± and p. A constant value of 1% was assigned to
all of these bins. Positively charged kaons are located
under the proton peak in the energy loss distribution
and the pion peak in the m2
tof distribution for momen-
tum larger than 3GeV/c. For this reason, the uncertainty
for K + can reach 15% for the higher momentum bins.
In case of K −, the obtained uncertainties are similar
to the ones for K +.
(v) Feed-down uncertainty. Produced K 0
s and Λ in the
target can decay before reaching the VTPC-1 and
some of the daughter particles reconstructed in the
TPCs can be extrapolated to the target surface. Since
the correction for this effect is calculated with the
Monte Carlo simulation, the number of produced
K 0
s and Λ is model dependent. A systematic uncer-
tainty of 30% on the feed-down correction fac-
tor was assigned, following the standard approach
in Refs. [8,10]. The systematic uncertainty is up
to 2% for π± and protons. Mostly low momen-
tum bins in the ﬁrst and last longitudinal bins are
affected.
(vi) The ToF-F efﬁciency uncertainty. The uncertainty of
the ToF-F efﬁciency was taken as a systematic uncer-
tainty. It goes up to 2%, but for most of the bins it is
well below 1%.
(vii) Ad-hoc uncertainty. A constant conservative uncer-
tainty of 25% was assigned to the bins that are cor-
rected by the ad-hoc correction factor. The value was
based on half the size of the typical ad hoc correction
(50%).
Totalsystematicuncertaintiesforindividualanalysisbinsand
for each particle type are shown in Figs. 17, 18, 19, 20 and
21 (middle row).
Respective contributions to the total systematic uncer-
tainties for different particle types are shown in Fig. 22.
Different regions of the phase space have different dom-
inant contributions. For example, the dominant contribu-
tion in the third longitudinal bin (z3) for π± yields comes
from the reconstruction efﬁciency uncertainty, while the
dominant contribution for K ± comes from the PID uncer-
tainty.

Uncertainties on the hadron yields are shown in Figs. 17, 18,

the middle rows show systematic uncertainty and the bottom
rows show total uncertainties. For π+, π−and p statistical
uncertainties dominate in the low (< 40 mrad) and high (>
200 mrad) polar angle region. While for 40 < θ < 200 mrad,
the systematic uncertainties are comparable to or larger than
the statistical uncertainties. For kaons, the total uncertainty is
mostly dominated by the statistical uncertainty. Tables with
numerical results are presented in Ref. [26].

5.1 Comparisons with models
The results were compared with NuBeam and QGSP_BERT
physics lists from Geant4.10.03 [27,28]. Detailed compar-
isons are presented in Figs. 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28 for π+
yields, in Figs. 29, 30, 31, 32, 33 and 34 for π−yields, in
Figs. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39 and 40 for K + yields, in Figs. 41, 42,
43, 44, 45 and 46 for K −yields, and in Figs. 47, 48, 49, 50,
51 and 52 for p yields. The NuBeam physics list provides
better predictions of π+, π−, K +, and K −yields. However,
both physics lists fail to accurately predict p yields. Similar
behaviour was noticed in the previous NA61/SHINE mea-
surements of primary proton-carbon interactions at 31GeV/c
[8], where it was shown that most of the models poorly repro-
duce proton yields. The earlier observation [10] that a better
agreement with Fluka2011 predictions can be obtained by
lowering the production cross section in Fluka2011 is con-
ﬁrmed.

5.2 Comparison with previous NA61/SHINE
measurements
As previously mentioned, NA61/SHINE provided measure-
ments of the π± yields emitted from the T2K replica target
using data collected in 2009 [10]. Since the beam proﬁles
for the data taken in 2009 and 2010 are different, a direct
comparison between the 2009 measurements and the mea-
surements presented in this paper is not possible. The beam
proﬁle for the 2009 measurements is wider, and the 2009 pion
yields are expected to be larger for the low angle upstream
longitudinal bins. The differences decrease for more down-
stream longitudinal bins and higher angles. But even for the
downstream face of the target and high angles (> 100 mrad)
perfect agreement is not expected since Monte Carlo simu-
lations show small differences in re-interactions for different
beam proﬁles. Detailed Monte Carlo studies can be found
in Ref. [13]. However, under the assumption that major dif-

[27,28] are overlaid on top of the data
applied in the phase space binning as deﬁned in Ref. [10].
Also, Monte Carlo and tof correction factors were calcu-
lated, but the ad hoc correction was not applied. It is impor-
tant to note that systematic uncertainties were not reevalu-
ated for the new phase space bins. Qualitative comparisons
of π+ and π−yields can be seen in Figs. 53, 54, respec-
tively. Only two polar angle bins are selected and presented
for all longitudinal bins. A quantitative agreement between
the two sets of measurements is not expected due to the sim-
pliﬁed assumptions described above, as well as differences in
the beam divergence which were not accounted for. Indeed,
some differences in the π+ yields can be observed for small
angles. However, in general, these two sets of measurements
are consistent within about 20%. Note that the systematic
uncertainties were not reevaluated for these special 2010
measurements and they are not shown on the plots. Addi-
tionally, only differences in the radial beam distribution were
taken into account, while differences in the beam divergence
were ignored.
In order to demonstrate the reliability of the computed
π−yields, an independent full chain of data analysis was
performed. By means of the software tools and procedures

dinal target bin, for small momentum (below 6 GeV/c) and
polar angles (θ below 40 mrad), and in the θ interval [300;
400] mrad for the ﬁrst three longitudinal target bins.
6 Dependence of the T2K re-weighting factors on the
proton beam proﬁle
The results presented in Sect. 5 will be used in the T2K
neutrino beam simulation for re-weighting of the hadron
yields on the target surface. Details of the currently used
re-weighting procedure based on NA61/SHINE thin-target
measurements are presented in Ref. [4].
The weights are simply calculated as the ratio of the data
yields and the Fluka2011 yields for each (p, θ, z) bin as
follows:
Wi jk =

NPOT
ni jk
Δpi jkΔθi j
	
data



NPOT
ni jk
Δpi jkΔθi j
	
MC
.

These weights are applied to all neutrinos that have a
hadron ancestor exiting the target surface in the phase space
covered by NA61/SHINE. As previously mentioned, hadron

yields coming from the surface of the long target depend on
the width and position of the incoming proton beam hitting
the upstream face of the target. Since it was shown that this
effectismostlygeometrical,thereisthepossibilitythatthere-
weightingfactorsareinvariantunderthebeamproﬁlechange.
To test this hypothesis, Fluka2011.2c.5 was used as input
for data and the NuBeam physics list from Geant4.10.03 as
input for the Monte Carlo. Around 40 × 106 protons on tar-
get were simulated for NA61/SHINE T2 and T3 beam proﬁles
using both models. Re-weighting factors were calculated for
both beam proﬁles and compared. Examples of the ratios
for π+ and p are shown in Fig. 55. Some differences can
be noticed for the upstream z bins, while for other bins any
differences are mostly below 2%. It is important to note that
the differences between the T2 and T3 beam proﬁles are very
large in comparison to differences between the T2 and T2K
beam proﬁles.

Thus, one can use the measured NA61/SHINE double dif-
ferential hadron yields in the T2K ﬂux simulation in the fol-
lowing way:
(i) Run the simulation of interactions inside the target for
the NA61/SHINE T2 beam proﬁle.
(ii) Calculate the re-weighting factors.
(iii) Run the simulation with the T2K beam proﬁle.
(iv) Re-weight the new simulation using the previously cal-
culated re-weighting factors.

7 Summary and conclusions
Measurements of the double differential yields of π+, π−,
K +, K −and p emitted from the surface of a 90-cm-long
carbon target (T2K replica) with incoming 31 GeV/c pro-
tons were performed by the NA61/SHINE experiment at
the CERN SPS. Yields of π+ and π−were measured with
improved precision compared to the previously published
NA61/SHINE results, while K +, K −and p yields were
obtained for the ﬁrst time. These measurements are crucial
for reducing the hadron production component of the T2K
(anti)neutrino ﬂux error, which is the dominant component in
the ﬂux uncertainty. Any reduction of the ﬂux uncertainties
will directly improve measurements of the (anti)neutrino-
nucleus cross sections as well as of the (anti)neutrino oscil-
lation parameters in T2K. A simple method of using these
results in T2K which avoids problems with the dependence
on the incident proton beam proﬁle is proposed.

that none of the models predicts accurately the measured
