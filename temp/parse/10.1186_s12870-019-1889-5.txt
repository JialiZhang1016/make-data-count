Abstract
Background: Wheat grains contain gluten proteins, which harbour immunogenic epitopes that trigger Coeliac disease
in 1–2% of the human population. Wheat varieties or accessions containing only safe gluten have not been identified
and conventional breeding alone struggles to achieve such a goal, as the epitopes occur in gluten proteins encoded
by five multigene families, these genes are partly located in tandem arrays, and bread wheat is allohexaploid. Gluten
immunogenicity can be reduced by modification or deletion of epitopes. Mutagenesis technologies, including CRISPR/
Cas9, provide a route to obtain bread wheat containing gluten proteins with fewer immunogenic epitopes.
Results: In this study, we analysed the genetic diversity of over 600 α- and γ-gliadin gene sequences to design six sgRNA
sequences on relatively conserved domains that we identified near coeliac disease epitopes. They were combined in four
CRISPR/Cas9 constructs to target the α- or γ-gliadins, or both simultaneously, in the hexaploid bread wheat cultivar
Fielder. We compared the results with those obtained with random mutagenesis in cultivar Paragon by γ-irradiation. For
this, Acid-PAGE was used to identify T1 grains with altered gliadin protein profiles compared to the wild-type endosperm.
We first optimised the interpretation of Acid-PAGE gels using Chinese Spring deletion lines. We then analysed the
changes generated in 360 Paragon γ-irradiated lines and in 117 Fielder CRISPR/Cas9 lines. Similar gliadin profile alterations,
with missing protein bands, could be observed in grains produced by both methods.
Conclusions: The results demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of using CRISPR/Cas9 to simultaneously edit multiple
genes in the large α- and γ-gliadin gene families in polyploid bread wheat. Additional methods, generating genomics
and proteomics data, will be necessary to determine the exact nature of the mutations generated with both methods.

Background
Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a staple crop
worldwide and an important source of calories, nutri-
ents, fibre and protein. The largest protein fraction in
wheat grains is gluten, a polymer of glutenins and glia-
dins. Glutenins provide elastic properties, which are
essential for bread dough quality, while gliadins provide
viscosity with less impact on dough quality [1].
Wheat can cause allergies and/or intolerances after
consumption in susceptible individuals [2, 3]. The most
common disorder is an autoimmune reaction triggered
by gluten immunogenic epitopes, known as coeliac dis-
ease (CD), which occurs in 1–2% of the human popula-
tion [4–8]. Currently, the only treatment is a gluten-free
(GF) diet, excluding all wheat, barley and rye. On a daily
basis, the GF diet is difficult to follow as wheat gluten is
added to a large range of food products. In addition, GF

products are less healthy, with low levels of proteins and
nutrients plus high levels of salt while many additives
are needed to simulate the unique rheological properties
of wheat gluten [9–12]. Breeding for wheat varieties that
are free of, or have reduced levels of immunogenic epi-
topes, is therefore a potential solution for healthier prod-
ucts which are safe to consume by CD patients [13–16].
Bread wheat is hexaploid, so each locus is present on
the homoeologous chromosome pairs of the three differ-
ent sub-genomes, A, B and D. Immunogenic epitopes
occur in α- γ- and ω- gliadins and to a lesser extent in
low molecular weight (LMW) glutenins while high mo-
lecular weight (HMW) glutenins are mostly safe for CD
patients [17] and constitute the main gluten family re-
sponsible for bread dough quality [1]. Gliadin proteins
are encoded by large gene families. They are clustered
together as repetitive sequences in characterised loci, do
not contain introns but do include high numbers of
pseudogenes (90% in case of α-gliadins) [18]. In hexa-
ploid wheat, the α-gliadin genes are grouped in the Gli-2
locus on the short arm of each of the group 6 chromo-
somes and number between 60 and 150 copies [19, 20].
The short arm of each of the group 1 chromosomes con-
tains both the Gli-1 locus with around 40 γ-gliadins, and
the Gli-3 locus, with approximately 16 ω-gliadins [21],
in the hexaploid genome. Variants of the immunogenic
epitopes that are not recognised by T cell receptors, do
exist in hexaploid bread wheat [22], but in all genotypes
they are found in combination with other, highly im-
munogenic epitope variants [18, 23–25]. There is a cor-
relation between the level of immunogenicity of gliadin
epitopes and the sub-genome on which they are located
[18, 26]; gliadins from genome B tend to be less im-
munogenic while gliadins from genome D are more im-
munogenic. Given this level of complexity, it is not
surprising that conventional breeding alone has not yet
succeeded in generating “gluten-safe” wheat, containing
only gliadins with non-immunogenic epitopes or even
with no gliadin at all [13, 16, 27].
Alternatively, RNAi targeting all three gliadin families
has successfully decreased 97% of gliadin expression in
bread wheat grain and the gluten extract did not stimu-
late CD patient T cells while dough quality was barely
affected [28, 29] Similarly, Becker et al. [30] decreased
the expression of 20 α-gliadins yet increased expression
of other storage proteins. Wen et al. [31] reduced the ex-
pression of DEMETER, preventing DNA-methylation
changes and thus repressing glutenin and gliadin gene
expression in the endosperm. As the transgenic RNAi
construct remains in the wheat genome to silence the
genes, such plants are subject to GM regulation. An-
other approach towards wheat with hypoimmunogenic
gluten is mutation breeding. This method which is
exempted
from
GM
regulation,
has
recently
been
applied to develop “ultra-low gluten” barley [32], which
is being used to produce gluten-free beer in Germany.
Developing wheat with hypoimmunogenic gluten using a
similar approach is theoretically possible although it
constitutes a greater challenge [15]. Wheat γ-irradiated
lines have to be identified that lack large regions on the
short arm of chromosomes 1 or 6, yet have lost gliadin
or LMW-glutenin genes in one of the three homoeolo-
gous genomes. Plants with the 12 different events have
to be self-fertilised to become homozygous for the dele-
tion and then inter-crossed to obtain hypoimmunogenic
gluten while maintaining bread wheat unique baking
quality conferred by HMW-glutenin loci. Gene editing
using CRISPR/Cas9 represents an alternative approach
that enables modification or deletion of the immuno-
genic
gliadin
genes
in
order
to
generate
non-
immunogenic gluten while retaining the viscosity pro-
vided by gliadins required for good bread dough quality.
CRISPR/Cas9 has successfully been used in polyploid
wheat to induce mutations in all six alleles of single copy
genes. Zhang et al. [33] targeted up to four genes in
bread wheat, using various gene editing approaches. Gil-
Humanes et al. [34] targeted two single-copy genes sim-
ultaneously for gene targeting (i.e. with a DNA repair
template) without integrating a Cas9 construct in the
genome. CRISPR/Cas9 has been used once before to
modify gluten, when Sánchez-León et al. [16] targeted
multiple α-gliadin genes.
In this study, we have transformed the hexaploid bread
wheat cultivar Fielder with constructs containing Cas9
and combinations of single guide RNAs (sgRNA) target-
ing specific sites upstream of, or within, the CD epitopes
in the α-gliadin as well as the γ-gliadin gene family.
These constructs would potentially create nucleotide
changes and small indels in the epitope regions, or dele-
tion of the epitope regions, either in, or out of frame. In
the ideal scenario, small in-frame mutations would be
generated, producing non-immunogenic gliadins which
retained the desired rheological properties. Small out of
frame mutations upstream the epitope region, would
generate a knock out of the gliadin that should prevent
the immunogenicity but may affect bread dough quality.
However, the transcription of the truncated protein
could prevent the often-reported compensation by other
gliadin genes [35, 36]. Since gliadin genes are clustered
as
repeat
sequences,
simultaneously
targeting
non-
consecutive genes could generate the deletion of inter-
vening gliadin gene copies. This possibility, similar to
but more precise than γ-irradiation events, presents the
advantage of fully supressing the epitopes, but often trig-
gers compensation of expression by the remaining glia-
din genes. This attempt to use CRISPR/Cas9 to mutate
gliadin families in polyploid wheat was a pilot experi-
ment. The aim was to mutate as many gliadin genes as

possible, in any manner, to test whether CRISPR/Cas9
could be an appropriate method to simultaneously mod-
ify sufficient gene copies in order to change qualitatively
and/or quantitatively the gliadin content in wheat grains.
An additional aim was to study the frequency of the dif-
ferent mutation types and to identify the most relevant
methods to use in order to screen for wheat grain with
mutated gliadins.
Due to the high sequence complexity, variability
and number of targeted gliadin genes, a simple PCR
on wild type plants would give numerous bands. A
CAPS assay to reveal mutations by identifying re-
striction site loss, would not be possible since not
all sequences would carry the site. In addition, regu-
lar gene cloning and sequencing would not be an ef-
ficient pre-screening method, given the complexity
of the genes, gene families and genomic loci under
study. Indeed, the cloning of the 50 to 100 single
different gene copies present in a plant cannot be
guaranteed and would require deep sequencing for
every
single
Fielder-CRISPR
plant
generated.
In
addition, as many gliadin genes are pseudogenes
[18, 26], the actual influence of potential mutations on
the phenotype could not quickly be assessed. Moreover,
using this approach on cDNA would have been inappro-
priate at this stage since mRNA extraction would have to
be done on endosperm from immature grain, without
damaging the embryo required to grow the potential mu-
tant progeny. Advanced proteomics techniques for gliadin
identification are currently under development, however,
being both time consuming and expensive, they would be
more appropriately used as a final epitope characterisation
method, rather than for pre-screening. Consequently,
Acid-PAGE was employed as a first screening method
to
identify
gliadin
protein
profile
changes
simul-
taneously in targeted and untargeted gliadin gene
families. This method has the advantage of being
cheap and revealing mutations in expressed genes
with an impact on the proteome, necessary to develop
wheat lines with hypoimmunogenic gluten. However,
this method reveals mainly full gene copy deletions,
non-sense or off-frame mutations implying absence or
truncation of gene translation but not mis-sense or
small in frame mutations.

sequence alignments of α-gliadins (a) and γ-gliadins (b) based on a total of 438 and 187 DNA sequences, respectively. The variation in the
sequences form patterns which are grouped here and associated to the genome in which they are mostly found (A, B, D on the left side of each
group), based on comparison of hexaploid wheat sequences with sequences from diploid relatives. The different gliadin protein domains are
indicated and the position of the CD immunogenic epitopes are boxed. The DQ2.5 epitopes box includes the DQ2.5-α1, −α2 and - α3 epitopes
(Additional file 1: Figure S1 and Additional file 2: Figure S2). The sgRNAs targeted motifs are highlighted in yellow and the potential gene editing
sites are marked with scissors. sgRNA_γ272 may cut multiple times, depending on the number of repetitions of the most abundant γ-gliadin CD
epitope, DQ2.5-glia-γ4c, which it targets. Details on the alignment, sequence patterns and CD epitopes can be found in Additional file 1: Figure
S1 and Additional file 2: Figure S2. The MEGA and fasta files are also provided as Additional Files.

We compared the changes that occurred in our Fielder-
CRISPR gene-edited lines with those we found in selected
lines from a γ-irradiated mutant collection in variety Para-
gon [37], and in selected chromosome arm deletion lines
in the reference wheat cultivar Chinse Spring [38, 39].
Results
Sequence alignment and sgRNA design
Genomic sequences of 1273 α-gliadin and 442 γ-gliadin
genes from several wheat species and varieties were
translated into protein sequences and manually aligned
to infer position of epitope and most conserved regions,
and to superimpose this information on the DNA se-
quence. The alignment was optimised by hand, especially
around the repetitive parts of α- and γ-gliadin protein se-
quences as presented in Additional file 1: Figure S1 and
Additional file 2: Figure S2, respectively. These Supple-
mentary Figures are useful to quickly visualise the species
and homoeologous genome to which they are associated
and the sub-grouping based on the α- and γ-gliadin se-
quence pattern and the position or absence of the differ-
ent overlapping CD canonical epitopes.
For α-gliadins, five protein subgroups exist based on se-
quence patterns, two associated to genome A, two to gen-
ome B, and one that presents a unique amino-acid variant
specific for genome A or D. Some CD epitopes were
present or absent in specific protein subgroups. As a con-
sequence, some CD epitopes are specific for one homoeo-
logous genome (Additional file 1: Figure S1). Pseudogenes
were identified having similar sequences to intact genes
but harbouring early stop codons at various places [40].
In γ-gliadins, six protein subgroups exist based on se-
quence patterns, two associated with genome A, one
with genome B and the three others associated to ge-
nomes B and/or D (Additional file 2: Figure S2). Some
CD epitopes were only present in some specific protein
subgroups. However, this does not lead to a good correl-
ation between epitopes and a sub-genome, as most epi-
topes
occur
in
γ-gliadins
from
all
three
genomes
(Additional file 2: Figure S2). Six groups of pseudogenes
were observed that did not simply contain an early stop
codon but also had divergent sequences compared to
the 6 groups of full length γ-gliadins. This is consistent
with the hypothesis of Goryunova et al. [41] that the
various γ-gliadin groups largely predate the evolution of
the genomes within the genus Triticum/Aegilops. Con-
sequently, sgRNA were designed focusing on full length
genes
while
considering
pseudogenes
as
much
as
possible.
Six sgRNAs were designed, three of which target α-
gliadins (Fig. 1a) and the other three targeting γ-gliadins
(Fig. 1b). In each gene family one target site was placed
upstream in the gene, soon after the signal peptide, with
the aim of disrupting the open reading frame and the
two others were near or in the innate or DQ2.5 coeliac
disease epitope regions in order to modify or remove the
epitope region.
Our alignments show that as a result of the existing se-
quence differences, largely within the DQ2.5 epitope region
(Additional file 1: Figure S1 and Additional file 2: Figure
S2), one sgRNA cannot theoretically target all the intended
sites present in the hexaploid bread wheat genome. For in-
stance, sgRNA_α324 was not predicted to target the two
groups of genes associated with genome B while sgRNA_
α87 was only predicted to target some genes related to one
of the two α-gliadin groups of the B genome. sgRNA_α213,
however, should recognise its target motif in all 5 different
α-gliadins DQ2.5 groups, regardless of the genome they are
associated with (Fig. 1a). For the γ-gliadins, sgRNA_γ86
may not target one of the DQ2.5 groups typical for hexa-
ploid wheat (possibly genome D) while sgRNA_γ603 was
not predicted to target a group of genes associated to gen-
ome A. sgRNA_γ272 should target most of the γ-gliadin
DQ2.5 sequences and expected to cut between 1 and 6
times depending on the number of repetitions of the tar-
geted motif, corresponding to the most abundant γ-gliadin
CD epitope DQ2.5-glia-γ4c, throughout the epitope region
(Fig. 1b; Additional file 2: Figure S2).
Multiplexing sgRNAs in clustered gene families can gen-
erate many different types of mutation (Fig. 2). Indeed, a
simultaneous Cas9 cut within two non-consecutive gliadin
genes can delete the intervening genes. In addition, a simul-
taneous Cas9 cut upstream of and downstream of the epi-
tope region, may enable a minimal deletion of only the
potentially immunogenic region. Finally, simple single cuts
may create small indels or base substitutions at that site.
Generation of CRISPR/Cas9_sgRNA constructs and
transgenic fielder wheat plants
Four different CRISPR/Cas9_sgRNA binary constructs
were created containing Cas9 plus different combinations
of the sgRNAs (Table 1), transferred to A. tumefaciens and
used in stable transformation experiments with immature
embryos isolated from wheat cultivar Fielder. The number
of transformed T0 plants regenerated and expressing the
Cas9 gene (as determined by RT-PCR on leaf samples) are
presented in Table 1, together with the number of plants
harbouring one or two copies of the nptII gene, part of the
T-DNA containing the CRISPR/Cas9 construct.
A total of 150 T0 Fielder-CRISPR plantlets were regener-
ated, using the four constructs, among which 31 plants did
not express the Cas9, had prematurely aborting grains, or
died. Among the plants carrying the T-DNA, only two
plants transformed with the α2γ3_sgRNA construct did not
carry all the sgRNAs. Generally, T0 wheat plants generated
4 to 6 ears and 80–250 T1 grains. A subset of T1 grain
samples was analysed using Acid-PAGE.

Acid-PAGE analysis of gliadin proteins
Acid-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis has been used
for decades to differentiate and identify wheat varieties
based on their characteristic gliadin protein profile [42].
Here, we used Acid-PAGE to identify grains with modified
gliadin protein profiles from Fielder-CRISPR plants com-
pared with wild-type Fielder, and to determine the type of
changes that had occurred. We first optimised the inter-
pretation of the gels using Chinese Spring deletion lines,
and also analysed a Paragon γ-irradiated population to be
able to compare the type of changes induced by irradi-
ation mutagenesis with those induced by gene editing.
Note that some C-glutenins, which have a very high se-
quence similarity to gliadins, may also be edited. As we
used non-reducing extraction conditions, they will not be
extracted and hence are not visible on the Acid-PAGE
gels. This means that there may be additional edits in the
plants that were screened, that are not visible on the gels.
Optimizing acid-PAGE analysis using Chinese spring
deletion lines
Chinese Spring (CS), a model variety for hexaploid bread
wheat, plus the CS nullisomic/tetrasomic and CS Kansas
deletion lines, identified as either missing and/or having
substitutions of gliadin genes on known homoeologous
chromosomes arms, were used to set up and optimise the
gliadin protein profile screening method using Acid-PAGE.
These deletion and substitution lines revealed differ-
ences in gliadin protein patterns compared with to CS.
Various bands were missing or shifted on the Acid-
PAGE, depending on which chromosomes (Chr1 γ- and
ω-gliadins or Chr6 α-gliadins) and which homoeologous
genome (A, B or D) were changed (Fig. 3). As expected,
deletion lines and nullisomic/tetrasomic lines confirmed
each other. For instance, in panel e) and f) of Fig. 3, the
same two α-gliadin proteins are missing at the bottom of
the gel. Band shifts or changes in band intensity were
sometimes also seen in a gene family for which the loci
had not been changed, such as ω-gliadins in case of a
deletion in chromosome 6 (Fig. 3d, e). Deletion or sub-
stitution of genome 6B did not show any perceptible
change, neither in the α-gliadin proteins, nor in the
other gliadin families (data not shown).
In addition to optimising the method, the use of the CS
deletion lines gave indications on the position of bands
from α-, γ- and ω-gliadins which are specifically associated
with gliadin proteins originating from A, B or D homoeolo-
gous genomes [43]. This will constitute benchmarks to
infer, on non-characterised mutant lines, which homoeolo-
gous chromosome is the most likely to have been impaired.
Fig. 2 Representation of one α-gliadin Gli-2 locus and different mutation types potentially induced by CRISPR/Cas9. This schematic α-gliadin Gli-2
loci representation shows genes clustered and different types of mutations that can be induced by sgRNA. Simultaneous cuts in non-consecutive
genes can delete the intervening genes. Similarly, two simultaneous cuts flanking the epitope can delete only this region, whilst simple small
indels or base substitutions can also occur.

irradiation and to cause the protein profiling changes are indicated in the table. In total, four lines showed changes in the α-gliadins, seven lines had differences
in the γ-gliadins and nine lines displayed variations in the ω-gliadins. P6–57 had large changes in α-gliadins from, most likely, 6AS.

Analysis of the paragon γ-irradiated population
Wheat grains from various Paragon γ-irradiated lines were
screened using Acid-PAGE. Differences in gliadin proteins
profiles were observed between Paragon and M4 grains in
14 out of 360 γ-irradiated lines tested (3.88%).
Three lines showed differences in only the α-gliadins
(Fig. 4a, b, c), one line displayed variations in only the γ-
gliadins while four lines presented variations in only the
ω-gliadins. One line showed differences in both α- and
γ-gliadins (Fig. 4d) while two lines presented changes in
both γ-and ω-gliadins (Fig. 4e, f). No line screened
showed variations in all three gliadin families (Table 2).
By comparing the Paragon mutant gliadin protein pro-
files with those obtained from CS deletion lines and CS
nullisomic/tetrasomic lines, it was possible to infer the
homoeologous chromosome location of the gliadin genes
altered by γ-irradiation mutagenesis in the identified
Paragon lines (Table 2).
Analysis of the fielder CRISPR-Cas9 plants
For all of the 117 T0 plants expressing the Cas9 mRNA
and carrying the full complement of expected sgRNAs, 8 or
more randomly selected T1 grains per plant were screened
using Acid-PAGE. Differences in the gliadin protein profile
were observed between Fielder wild type and T1 grains har-
vested from some T0 CRISPR/Cas9 plants (Fig. 5; Table 3).
Modified profiles were found for each of the 4
CRISPR/Cas9_sgRNA constructs used (Fig. 5). When a
modified grain was found, most of the other T1 grains
of that transformed plant showed a wild type profile.
When several mutated T1 grains were found from one
T0 plant, in some cases they contained similar profile
modifications (Fig. 5e), in other cases the changes were
different. Similarly altered gliadin protein profiles were
sometimes seen in grains coming from different T0
individuals carrying the same CRISPR/Cas9_sgRNA con-
structs or even from different constructs (Fig. 5a, d, at
α-gliadin level). Two classes of modifications were
noted: “clear changes” and “potential changes”. “Clear
changes” represented instances were protein bands dis-
appeared or appeared on the gel (Fig. 5a, b, e). Bands
could also be present at a different intensity (Fig. 5c, d)
or have a shifted position (Fig. 5c, e) that was not always
very clear and therefore recorded as “potential changes”
type. The term “any changes” refer to both clear and po-
tential changes. The changes in protein expression were
mostly present in the targeted gliadin families. However,
differences in intensity or shifts in size were sometimes
seen in bands associated with non-targeted gliadin fam-
ilies (Fig. 5c, d, e). Based on the deletion of three α-
gliadin bands obtained with construct α1 in grain α1–
14_G1, 21 more grains from the T0 α1–14 plant were
screened. However, none of them had an altered gliadin
protein profile compared with Fielder.
The constructs differed significantly in mutation effi-
ciency for any changes (Chi square, P = 0.015) but not for
clear changes (P = 0.097) (Table 3). Construct α1_sgRNA
had the lowest apparent mutation efficiency, with very low
number of grains showing any mutations on Acid-PAGE
while having the highest number of T0 plants expressing
Cas9. Construct α2_sgRNA had the lowest number of T0
plants expressing Cas9 but the highest percentage of
grains showing clear changes. Construct
γ3_sgRNA
generated the highest number of grains with any
class of mutations. Construct α2γ3_sgRNA gave only
3 plants with clearly mutated grains but these plants
gave three or four mutant grains each, which is the
highest ratio of mutated grain per plant (Table 3).
It
was
observed
that
construct
γ3_sgRNA
and
construct α2γ3_sgRNA produced grains which rela-
tively often had differences in ω-gliadin expression

although these constructs do not target this gliadin
family. This phenomenon was rarely observed with
construct α2_sgRNA and seen only once with con-
struct α1_sgRNA.
No correlation was found between transgene copy num-
ber present in a plant and the number of grains presenting
an altered gliadin protein profile, nor in the number of mu-
tations seen per grain. Since the Cas9 expression was ob-
served by RT-PCR, but was not quantified, no correlation
can be made between its expression level and the number
of gliadin protein changes observed using Acid-PAGE.
Discussion
In this study, CRISPR/Cas9 was deployed in hexaploid
bread wheat to simultaneously target multiple gliadin
genes. The Cas9-induced mutations were designed to re-
move gliadin gene copies or disrupt their immunogenic
epitopes in gliadins, so preventing them from triggering
the human immune system and causing coeliac disease
upon wheat gluten consumption. At the start of this
study, CRISPR/Cas9 had not been used to target large
clusters of repeated gene families, such as the gliadins,
in polyploid crops such as hexaploid wheat. Therefore,
the challenge was not only to generate such mutant
plants but also to develop screening methods to identify
them and characterise their mutations further.
Gliadin alignments, sgRNA design and generation of
fielder-CRISPR lines generation
In the absence of α- and γ-gliadin genomic or proteomic
sequences from the hexaploid wheat cultivar Fielder
used for gliadin gene editing experiments, and consider-
ing the time and resources necessary to fully clone and
sequence these gene families, an alternative approach
was used mainly based on publicly available data. Only
seven α-gliadins from Fielder were cloned, sequenced
and merged with all α-gliadin genomic sequences from
GenBank/ENA. The Fielder sequences were different to
one another but similar to some sequences already
present in GenBank/ENA. Deduced protein sequences
were manually aligned to enable inferring gliadin epitope
positions and conserved regions in gliadin gene se-
quences across cultivars. Using this approach, it was
possible to design sgRNA targeting as many gliadin
genes as possible near their epitope region, not only in
Fielder but also in many other different cultivars. Align-
ment of gliadin sequences also revealed the presence of
groups based on sequences patterns, some associated to
specific homoeologous genomes, similarly to what was
observed by Ozuna et al. [20]. The same approach was
used for γ-gliadins, although no Fielder γ-gliadins were
sequenced. The association of CD epitopes and genomes
of origin was possible for α-gliadins whereas it was not
straightforward for γ-gliadins.
The sequences downloaded from GenBank/ENA origi-
nated from different hexaploid varieties. When se-
quences
from
one
cultivar
are
uploaded
into
the
database, there is no guarantee that the set of sequence
variants per cultivar is complete. Furthermore, gliadin
genes are present in each homoeologous genome and
clustered at specific loci as multiple copy repeats, with
identical or variable sequences. A gene sequence found
multiple times in one cultivar, is uploaded only once as
new sequence to avoid redundancy. However, if an iden-
tical sequence was found in different cultivars or in the
same cultivar in different studies by different groups, it
will be present several times in the database. Therefore,
the frequency with which a sequence is present in the
alignments generated for this study does not reflect
the frequency at which a gene sequence is present in
the genome of a cultivar such as Fielder. As a result,
the proportion of sequences targeted by the different
sgRNA designed does not reflect the real percentages
of matching sequences present in Fielder, especially
since the evaluation was made on 100% match while
in reality, sgRNA are known to also target sequences
with slightly lower similarity [44].
Four CRISPR/Cas9_sgRNA constructs, containing 1 to 5
different sgRNAs, were designed and used to target α- and/
or γ-gliadin gene families, in hexaploid wheat. The con-
structs were stably transformed into bread wheat cultivar
Fielder. A total of 117 regenerated lines expressed Cas9, re-
gardless of which construct they carried. The T1 grains
generated by these plants potentially contain mutations at a
number of target sites which are segregating independently.
However, it is possible that the Cas9-induced mutation is
heterozygous in a cell. It is also possible that Cas9 did not
cut the same genes in different cells of the T0 plant, thus
generating chimerical plants or even that Cas9 remained
active in the gametes after meiosis. This means that, follow-
ing segregations events, each grain generated by a T0 plant
could have a unique assortment of gliadin mutations. For
this reason, each grain was cut into three parts, the embryo
and two identical pieces of endosperm, to run further com-
plementary types of analysis (sequencing and advanced pro-
teomics) on the identical fractions of endosperm isolated
from the same T1 or T2 grain.
Pre-screening for wheat grains with mutated gliadins
Due to the high complexity of the large gliadin gene
families that are only expressed in wheat grains, the
traditional screening methods such as restriction site
loss or sequencing are not appropriate for pre-screening
and identification of potential mutants. Instead, these
methods would be relevant for in depth study and charac-
terisation of the mutations occurring in interesting mutants

identified using different pre-screening methods. Acid-
PAGE was successful for identifying gliadin protein profile
differences [42] and we therefore employed it for high-
throughput pre-screening of the grains from mutant wheat
plants. This method was first optimised using CS and asso-
ciated set of deletion lines and nullisomic-tetrasomic lines.
These lines were previously characterised as missing chro-
mosomes or chromosome arms that carry gliadin genes
from specific homoeologous genome. These lines enabled
identifying the homoeologous chromosome arms and the
sub-genome that most likely was altered in a mutant, based
on the absence or shift in position of the band.
The optimised Acid-PAGE protocol was then used to
identify 14 lines out of 360 (3.9%) Paragon γ-irradiated
lines that showed gliadin proteins expression changes
compared to wild type Paragon. Lines showed changes
in one or two gliadin families but never in all three fam-
ilies simultaneously. Irradiation mutation is known to
trigger large deletions, up to several mega-bases, which
can explain the deletion of a complete gliadin gene
locus. The nature of the homoeologous chromosomes
altered by γ-radiation were inferred based on the results
obtained using the CS deletion line resources, since
similarly large deletions are expected in both line sets.
The percentage of mutations observed in Paragon γ-
irradiated germplasm using on Acid-PAGE was around
4%, for all visible changes in the three large gliadin gene
families, each counting more than dozens of members.
Similarly, Acid-PAGE allowed pre-screening of T1
germplasm generated via CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing.
Changed gliadin profiles were observed with each con-
struct, implying that each construct contained at least one
sgRNA that successfully generated mutations in some
copies of the targeted α- or γ-gliadin gene family. More
importantly, it indicated that CRISPR/Cas9 can edit a suf-
ficient number of genes within large family in polyploid
plants to actually generate a different phenotype in the
progeny. The Acid-PAGE analysis of the Fielder-CRISPR
lines revealed differences in gliadin profiles in 70 T1 grains
(6.1% of the total number of grains tested) harvested from
36 T0 plants (30.8% of the total number of T0 plants ex-
pressing
CRISPR/Cas9
constructs)
across
all
four
CRISPR/Cas9_sgRNA constructs used. Therefore, a single
T0 plant that produced T1 mutant grains, gave on average
2 mutant grains out of 8 grains tested.
Constructs targeting γ-gliadins sometimes triggered
a shift of protein bands in the untargeted ω-gliadins.
This phenomenon could be explained by the deletion
of ω-gliadins located between targeted γ-gliadins since
both gene families are suspected to have some over-
lap on the short arm of chromosome 1 [45]. More-
over, it is also known that knocking out some gene in
a gluten family triggers the compensation by other
gene families [35, 36].
Variation in gene editing efficiency could be observed be-
tween the constructs, with construct α1_sgRNA being sig-
nificantly less efficient. This could be explained by the
presence of only one sgRNA in this construct while several
are present in the other constructs used. It could also be
due to a presence of secondary structure in the sgRNA –
identified after use, using RNAfold software - that could de-
crease the target binding efficiency. The number of sgRNA
in a construct appears to slightly increase the ratio of mu-
tant grains obtained, but no direct correlation was observed.
Indeed, construct α2_sgRNA and construct γ3_sgRNA gen-
erated 19 and 23 mutant grains respectively while construct
α2γ3_sgRNA – combining both previous sgRNA guides in
a single construct - gave only 20 mutant grains, which does
not show a cumulative efficiency. However, estimation of
the Cas9 expression level in different plants as well as the
actual number of mutations generated at the DNA level
would be necessary to give a robust answer regarding the
variation of efficiency of the different constructs.
Comparison with other groups also using CRISPR/Cas9 to
target gluten genes in hexaploid wheat
Sánchez-León et al. [16], who used a sgRNA, namely
sgRNA_α2, having 13 overlapping bases with our sgRNA_
α213 and targeting α-gliadins 6 nucleotides upstream, re-
ported a higher success rate with T1 grains from one T0
CRISPR/Cas9 line being mutated in a similar way, and
inheriting those mutations in T2 grains. The difference in
results may be related to a low Cas9 efficiency in this case.
Cas9 sequences have quickly been improved to increase
the mutation efficiency and the Cas9 version we used (dif-
ferent from the one used by Sánchez-León et al. [16]) has
been reported as having a low efficiency [46, 47]. In
addition, we used the rice actin promotor, which has pre-
viously been shown to create stable heritable edits in
wheat [47], whereas most researchers have used the maize
ubiquitin promoter to express Cas9 in monocot plants
[16, 46]. These factors could contribute to the low number
of T1 mutant grains per T0 plants obtained but also the
low level of gene copies mutated within each mutant
wheat grain. It could also explain the absence of mutated
phenotype inheritance, assuming that with a higher effi-
ciency and most of the targeted genes mutated, compen-
sation of the mutated gene copies becomes much more
difficult for the crop.
Comparison of CRISPR/Cas9 targeted mutations with
random mutagenesis using γ-irradiation
Using either CRISPR/Cas9 or γ-irradiation, the mutation
efficiency revealed by the Acid-PAGE is comparable.
However, the actual mutation rate obtained by using
CRISPR is probably much higher. Fielder-CRISPR lines
tested correspond to T1 generation grain potentially het-
erozygous for mutations while Paragon γ-irradiated lines
Jouanin et al. BMC Plant Biology          (2019) 19:333 
Page 10 of 16
represented M4 generation grain where most mutations
are homozygous and easier to visualise. In addition,
Acid-PAGE will probably not reveal amino-acid substitu-
tions or small in-frame indels potentially generated by
CRISPR/Cas9 since proteins with different sequences
but having similar molecular weight/charge ratio can be
represented by a single band on the gel [48]. Moreover,
knocking out a gliadin gene may not supress any protein
band if another similar gene has not been knocked out.
Alternatively, 2D-gels could give a higher resolution but
other methods such as deep DNA sequencing are
needed to reveal and characterise more subtle types of
mutations and to get a better idea of the differences in
efficiency between both methods.
Interestingly, some T1 CRISPR-Fielder grains showed
an altered gliadin protein profile similar to some M4
Paragon γ-irradiated grains (Fig. 5a, e and Fig. 4a, f).
The difference, however, is that in the Fielder-CRISPR
grains, only the α- or γ-gliadin gene family were targeted
and are probably modified whereas in the Paragon γ-
irradiated grains it is likely that gliadin genes as well as
unrelated flanking genes were deleted. Furthermore,
wheat lines with small deletions in the epitope region
possibly generated by CRISPR/Cas9 would be more
favourable than multiple gene copy deletions generally
generated by γ-irradiation for two reasons. First of all,
the gliadin copies would remain, but in a ‘safer’ form for
CD, while retaining the baking properties that would
likely otherwise be lost if the genes were totally removed
using irradiation. In addition, having small CRISPR-
mediated deletions might avoid gene expression com-
pensation by other
potentially immunogenic genes,
whose expression is triggered when expression of a glia-
din gene family is partly knocked down. Moreover, the
γ-irradiated lines may have multiple unwanted deletions
at other genomic loci. However, following current regu-
lation regarding gene-editing and mutation breeding,
the Fielder-CRISPR wheat could not be grown in
many countries yet due to region-specific strict GM
regulation while the Paragon γ-irradiated wheat could
directly be grown and used in breeding programs
without any restrictions [14].
Conclusion
This pilot study aimed to mutate the large α- and γ-
gliadin gene families in hexaploid wheat to decrease glu-
ten immunogenicity for coeliac patients. We succeeded
in generating wheat grains that contained gliadin protein
profiles altered for the targeted gene family in the bread
wheat cultivar Fielder by targeted mutagenesis using
CRISPR/Cas9 and in identifying them in Paragon germ-
plasm
induced
by
random
mutagenesis
using
γ-
irradiation. As many gliadin genes appear likely not to
have been altered, optimisation via use of different
promoter and different Cas9 genes or new Base Editor
systems is required to obtain wheat plants which are safe
for CD patients.
The pre-screening and identification of the mutations
was
performed
using
Acid-PAGE,
which
identifies
mostly the non-sense mutations and large deletions.
However, the final purpose is to modify the epitopes into
safe versions without knocking out the complete gliadin
genes, in order to avoid compensation by other gliadins
and to maintain baking quality. Therefore, reliable high
throughput methods will be important for small in-
frame mutation detection in the known CD epitopes
[49]. Methods such as droplet digital PCR, enrichment
and sequencing as well as advanced proteomics studies
will be needed to identify also these subtle modifications
and characterise them further. This should further in-
crease the percentage of plants in which mutations have
been induced, even further and enable the identification
of mutations in T2 plants. Enrichment and sequencing
of our gene-edited grains is described in [50].
Segregating out the CRISPR/Cas9 construct from
promising lines and subsequently self-pollinating these
wheat lines to make all mutations homozygous would be
the next steps. Potentially interesting lines would then
need extensive investigation including immunological
tests using monoclonal antibodies to determine their im-
munogenicity level and rheological studies to evaluate
the bread dough quality obtained using these generated
“hypoimmunogenic-gluten” wheat lines.
Methods
Gliadin sequence alignment
Over 438 α-gliadin gene sequences from 30 wheat acces-
sions and 187 γ-gliadin gene sequences from hexaploid
wheat were downloaded from GenBank/ENA in September
2014 and July 2015 respectively, translated into amino acid
sequences, manually aligned using Mega_6 and clustered
based on their combination of known CD epitopes [49]. To
deduce the sub-genome of origin of different epitopes,
which is linked with the level of immunogenicity, sequences
from diploid bread wheat ancestors Triticum monococcum
and Triticum urartu (A genome), Aegilops speltoides (for
the B genome), Aegilops tauschii (D genome) and tetraploid
durum wheat Triticum turgidum (genome AB) were added
that were present in GenBank/ENA. To complete the align-
ments and facilitate sgRNA design, primers F: 5′-ATGA
ARACMTTTCYCATC-3′ [25] and R: 5′-YAGTTRGTAC-
CRAAGATGM-3′ were used to clone and sequence seven
intact α–gliadin genes from Fielder, the spring wheat variety
used for transformation. These α-gliadin gene sequences
were similar to the one already present in the databases.
This increased the total number of sequences used to 1273
α-gliadins and 442 γ-gliadins.

sgRNA protospacer design
Six sgRNA protospacers were designed on conserved re-
gions that were identified based on the sequence align-
ments and were present in the sequences of the hexaploid
wheat cultivar Fielder. Of these six sgRNAs, three tar-
geted α-gliadins and the other three targeted γ-
gliadins (Fig. 2). In each case, one targeted a region
downstream of the signal peptide, the other two tar-
geted regions in or near epitopes. These sgRNA tar-
get
the
complementary
DNA
strand
and
should
therefore be reverse-complemented to be found in
the GenBank/ENA sequences.

gets α-gliadins downstream the signal peptide, P87.

Streptococcus pyogenes
2NLS-Cas9 gene,
codon-optimized for rice and wheat expression, was
cloned from the pJIT163-2NLS-Cas9 plasmid [51]. Its
ribosome binding site (RBS) “CACC” was mutated into
“CCACC”, using site directed mutation PCR approach,
for increased expression in wheat. The optimised 2NLS-
Cas9 gene plus CaMV terminator sequence was trans-
ferred into binary vector pSC4Act-R1R2-SCV [52], con-
taining a rice actin promoter to drive the expression of
the Cas9 gene. Each sgRNA, was combined using mul-
tiple unique restriction sites and then integrated into the
final binary plasmids (Fig. 1) (named pAJ2_ followed by
sgRNA names).
Four T-DNA constructs were produced by combining
different sgRNAs, using multiple unique restriction sites:
Construct 1α_sgRNA = sgRNA_α87.
Construct 2α_sgRNA = sgRNA_α213 + sgRNA_α324.

sgRNA_γ86 + sgRNA_γ272 + sgRNA_γ603 (i.e., it combines
Construct 2α_sgRNA and Construct 3γ_sgRNA). Construct
2α_sgRNA is shown as an example in Fig. 6.
Stable transformation and generation of fielder-CRISPR
plants and derived grains
The CRISPR/Cas9-sgRNA binary vectors were transferred
to A. tumefaciens and used to transform immature em-
bryos of Fielder [53, 54]. Selection of transformed tissues
was based on the presence of the nptII gene conferring re-
sistance to the G418 antibiotic. Regenerated T0 plantlets
were transferred to soil and tested for T-DNA copy num-
ber using an nptII-based qPCR assay [54], for presence of
Cas9 gene and all sgRNA using PCR, and whether Cas9
was expressed using RT-PCR. Plantlets positive in all these
tests were grown in climate-controlled growth chambers,
bagged during anthesis, and T1 grains harvested.
The individual T1 grains were first cut transver-
sally, alongside the embryo, so that this could be
germinated later. The resulting endosperm section
was then cut in half longitudinally. One half was
used
for
Acid-PAGE.
Selected
T1
embryos
were
germinated in Petri dishes containing filter paper
soaked with water. Seedlings were potted in compost
after sufficient root development and transferred to
growth chambers until grain set. Ears containing T2
grains were harvested individually.
Other plant materials
Chinese Spring (CS) wild type (WT) and selected CS
Kansas deletion lines [39, 55] that lacked parts of
chromosome 1 or 6, were obtained from Kansas State
University (Table 1). In addition, CS nullisomic/tetraso-
mic lines [38] were obtained from the SeedStor, John
Innes Centre, UK (Table 1). The CS lines were used to
set up and optimise the Acid-PAGE separation.
The Paragon γ-irradiated population [37], obtained
from JIC (Norwich, UK) based on hexaploid spring
wheat cultivar Paragon, was also screened. Mature grains
from a subset of 360 lines self-pollinated for 4 genera-
tions (M4) were analysed on Acid-PAGE. The lines
screened were numbered from P3–47 to P6–79 and
from P10–19 to P10–96 (Table 4).
Acid-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (acid-PAGE)
For each Fielder-CRISPR plant, a minimum of 8 T1
grains were screened individually, alongside Fielder
WT. The grain samples were loaded in duplicate. As
Fielder exhibit some heterogeneity in its storage protein
profile on Acid-PAGE, grains from multiple Fielder plants
were loaded alongside on the gel. For T2, four grain sam-
ples from four different ears were loaded in duplicates. A
similar procedure was applied for screening of CS and
Paragon, with the exception that only two grains were
tested as they are homogeneous for the mutations due to
several generations of self-pollination.
Each half endosperm sample was crushed into fine pow-
der, and the gliadin fraction extracted overnight at 4 °C, in
150 μl of 25% dichloroethanol solution containing 0.05%
Pyronin Y. Duplicate 30 μl samples were loaded in wide
slots on 13% polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide-bis 19:1)
and run at 180 V, for 4 h at room temperature (adapted
from [41]). Gels were stained overnight in 10:1 solution of
15% trichloroacetic acid (TCA): industrial methylated
spirits (IMS) containing 10 g/L Coomassie Brilliant Blue
G250, then destained overnight in water.

tetraploid or hexaploid are separated by an empty line and the genomes
present in the species are indicated by smaller A, B and D letters in the
second column. The canonical sequences of CD epitopes, which often
overlap with one another, are framed in different colours with their cat-
egory number indicated as well. On top of the figure, scissors indicate
the position at which the sgRNA designed are cutting, relatively to the
position of the CD epitopes. Note that some patterns have specific CD
epitope combinations and are clearly associated to a genome, while
others are not. The 5th pattern has actually an amino-acid substitution in
genome A compared to genome D, making it safer for CD patients. Se-
quences from genome B have naturally occurring amino-acid deletions
within the epitope regions that prevent their recognition by the immune
system in comparison to proteins from other genomes. The MEGA and
fasta files for this alignment are provided as Additional file 3 and Add-
itional file 5. (PNG 1050 kb)
Additional file 2: Figure S2. γ-gliadin protein sequence alignment (as
image). A selected subset of the 1273 aligned γ-gliadin protein sequences
from cultivated wheat and wild relatives is indicated here. Six main pat-
terns based on variation at the DQ25 epitope region were identified and
are separated by horizontal dash-lines. Each pattern has been associated
to a dominant genome, indicated by large A, B or D letters on the first
column, with which its sequences appear to be associated to. Within a
pattern, sequence originating from different wheat species diploid, tetra-
ploid or hexaploid are separated by an empty line and the genomes
present in the species are indicated by smaller A, B and D letters in the
second column. The canonical sequences of CD epitopes, which often
overlap with one another, are framed in different colours with their cat-
egory number indicated as well. On top of the figure, scissors indicate
the position at which the sgRNA designed are cutting, relatively to the
position of the CD epitopes. A clear distinction was made by a thick dash
line between the full-length protein and truncated ones, usually arising
from pseudogenes. Note that some patterns have specific CD epitope
combinations and are clearly associated to a genome, while others are
not. The MEGA and fasta files for this alignment are provided as
