Abstract
1.	 Plant-soil legacies consisting of species-specific microbial communities are  
hypothesized to play a critical, structuring role in plant species coexistence pro-
cesses. Plant species are thought to perform worse on soil conditioned by the 
same species compared to soil of other species, which serves as a self-limitation 
mechanism and averts monodominance of strong competitors. Here, we test in a 
multispecies community setting, whether root colonization and resource utiliza-
tion of soil patches with distinct soil legacies are consistent with this hypothesis.
2.	 We grew eight grassland species together in an outdoor mesocosm set-up in un-
conditioned soil and created soil patches in these communities conditioned by one 
of four plant species, or a soil mixture of all four. During two subsequent growing 
seasons, we tested the effect of these conditioned soil patches on below-ground 
root colonization into the patches of each surrounding plant species using a novel 
sequencing-based approach. In addition, we tested the effect of soil conditioning 
on local root functioning by injecting tracers into the soil patches and measuring 
the recovery in above-ground biomass.
3.	 Against expectations, plant species did not place less roots in own soil patches 
compared to foreign soil patches, nor did species take up less tracer from own 
compared to foreign soil patches. Using structural equation modelling, we found 
that tracer uptake of the plant species was to a varying degree explained by root 
densities in the various soil patches and by differing soil nutrient availability of the 
soil patches. We conclude that soil legacy effects are inextricably connected to 
soil nutrient availability, which needs to be taken into account in plant-soil feed-
back research to understand the processes that shape plant communities.
4.	 Synthesis. We found that soil legacy effects in complex, multispecies semi-field 
conditions did not match expectations based on theory and experiments in con-
trolled conditions. Among the many complicating factors that may modify or even 
overrule soil legacy effects in semi-field settings, we identified soil nutrient avail-
ability as a critical force that may, together with soil biota, shape plant species 
coexistence processes.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Plant species coexistence is, for an important part, thought to re-
sult from interactions between plants and their species-specific soil 
biota. These interactions are thought to act as a structuring force 
in plant community dynamics, and to prevent superior competitors 
from dominating and subordinate competitors from being outcom-
peted from plant communities (Bever, Platt, & Morton,  2012; de 
Kroon et al., 2012). Currently, the most widely accepted framework 
for the underlying processes of plant species coexistence comes 
from Bever and colleagues (Bever, 1999, 2003; Bever et al., 2012; 
Bever, Westover, & Antonovics, 1997). In this framework, plant spe-
cies that build up a species-specific, antagonistic soil community in 
and around their roots experience reduced performance and com-
petitive ability over time. As a result, individuals of these species are 
expected to be outcompeted by other plant species on soil patches 
where their own, species-specific microbial antagonists have accu-
mulated. Consequently, continuous, non-random plant species re-
placements are expected on a given spot and no single plant species 
can monodominate the community (Bever et al., 2012).
The interaction between plants and their specific soil biota is 
often studied within the experimental concept of plant-soil feed-
back: soil property changes resulting from plant growth, which 
affects future plant growth on that same soil (van der Putten 
et al., 2013). Using this approach, the deleterious effects of own soil 
legacies have been shown to occur for the majority of plant species 
in a community (Cortois, Schröder-Georgi, Weigelt, van der Putten, 
& De Deyn, 2016; Crawford et al., 2019; Klironomos, 2002), whereas 
growth on soil legacies of other plant species (foreign soil) has gen-
erally been shown to improve the species’ performance compared to 
own soil growth (Bever et al., 1997; Hendriks et al., 2013; Petermann, 
Fergus, Turnbull, & Schmid, 2008; Semchenko et al., 2018). However, 
these results come largely from controlled, single species experi-
ments where competition was not taken into account, whereas com-
petition is one of the many factors that affects a species’ response 
to soil legacies (Chung & Rudgers, 2016; Kulmatiski, Beard, Stevens, 
& Cobbold, 2008; Lekberg et al., 2018; Petermann et al., 2008). With 
several studies failing to find a consistent link between controlled 
greenhouse and (semi-)field legacy experiments (Kivlin, Bedoya, 
& Hawkes,  2018; Schittko, Runge, Strupp, Wolff, & Wurst,  2016; 
Stanescu & Maherali, 2017), it is imperative to test the predictions of 
Bever and colleagues in a complex, multispecies community setting.
To properly understand soil legacy effects in multispecies com-
munities, we need to understand how plant species explore and 
utilize soils with different legacies and how this affects plant per-
formance. However, these mechanistic effects remain relatively 
unexplored. In pot experiments, Hendriks and colleagues (Hendriks, 
Ravenek, et al., 2015; Hendriks, Visser, et al., 2015) showed that 
some plant species develop less root biomass in their own soil than in 
foreign soil legacies. This suggests that plants, when given a choice, 
avoid placement of roots in unfavourable and/or increase root 
placement in favourable biotic soil spots similar to the well-known 
phenomenon of root proliferation into soil patches with abundant 
nutrients (Drew, 1975; Hodge, 2004; Hutchings & de Kroon, 1994; 
in ‘t Zandt, Le Marié, Kirchgessner, Visser, & Hund, 2015). At the 
same time, roots of some species took up more nutrients per metre 
root in foreign soil than in own soil (Hendriks, Visser, et al., 2015). 
Moreover, if a superior plant competitor showed a decreased root 
biomass in own soil, this created opportunities for the subordinate 
competitor to place its roots in the soil spot of the superior compet-
itor (Hendriks, Ravenek, et al., 2015). This confirms the general del-
eterious effect of own soil legacies and suggests a potential active 
escape mechanism of plants via root placement into more favourable 
soil conditions and a potential competitive advantage for otherwise 
subordinate species. This is in agreement with patterns observed in 
plant species invading resident communities of close relatives where 
the reproductive biomass of the invader was higher with spatially 
separated soil legacies compared to a mixture of these same soil leg-
acies (Burns, Brandt, Murphy, Kaczowka, & Burke,  2017). Yet, we 
lack knowledge on whether soil legacy effects as described above 
occur in multispecies plant communities and in longer term experi-
ments where factors such as seasonality and differing soil conditions 
are prominent. To understand the explicit effects of soil legacies on 
plant community processes, we tested how patches of conditioned 
soil affect plant species rooting patterns, nutrient uptake and how 
these parameters are influenced by soil nutrient availability in exper-
imental, multispecies plant communities.
In a multispecies plant community setting, we tested whether 
root colonization and resource utilization of soil patches play a struc-
turing role in plant-soil feedback effects and are in line with expec-
tations based on theory and controlled experiments. Moreover, we 
determined via which pathways these plant responses occurred. 
For this, we grew four forb and four grass species that naturally 
co-occur in a species-rich mountain meadow in experimental meso-
cosm communities. In the eight-species mesocosm communities, we 
left open patches containing soil conditioned by one of the species 
using inoculum soil from the field site, comparable to the soil con-
ditioning approach used in plant-soil feedback experiments. During 
two subsequent growing seasons, we determined root colonization 
at two soil depths inside the conditioned soil patches using a novel 
sequencing-based approach to identify plant roots to species level 
(Wagemaker et al., in review). Moreover, we injected a mixture of 
nutrient tracers in the soil patches and measured tracer uptake by 
the species surrounding the patch. We ask (a) whether local soil leg-
acies affect plant root placement and whether species avoid their 
own and favour foreign conditioned soil, and establish (b) whether

plant tracer uptake is affected by local soil legacies and lower in 
patches with own soil compared to foreign conditioned soil. Finally, 
using a structural equation modelling (SEM) approach, we combine 
root placement and tracer uptake results to test (c) via which path-
ways local soil legacy effects occur and whether these pathways are 
plant species-specific. In these models, we include plant available 
soil nutrients of the patches as a potential underlying driver as it is 
well known for affecting a plants’ root placement.
2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 | Plant species selection
Eight plant species were selected of which four focal species: 
Anthoxanthum odoratum, Festuca rubra, Leontodon hispidus and 
Plantago lanceolata, and four non-focal species: Agrostis capillaris, 
Achillea millefolium, Nardus stricta and Veronica chamaedrys. Plant 
species were selected based on previous plant-soil feedback experi-
ments in which these species showed negative feedback on own con-
ditioned soil (with the focal species showing the strongest negative 
responses; D. in ‘t Zandt, T. Herben, A. van den Brink, E.J.W. Visser, 
& H. de Kroon, unpubl. results) and based on intraspecific density 
dependence calculated in a species-rich mountain meadow in the 
Krkonoše Mountains, North Bohemia, Czech Republic (vicinity of Pec 
pod Sněžkou, 50°41′28″N, 15°47′35″E, 880 m a.s.l.) in which these 
species showed negative intraspecific density effects (self-limitation; 
Herben, Hadincová, Krahulec, Pecháčková, & Skálová, 2019).
2.2 | Mesocosm experimental design
We created plant communities consisting of the four focal and four 
non-focal plant species and grew these in an outdoor mesocosm fa-
cility, the Nijmegen Phytotron, from July 2016 until September 2018. 
Plants were grown in compartments of 50 × 50 × 70 cm each (175 L), 
resulting in 48 plant communities in total. Compartments were filled 
with a loamy unconditioned soil sieved at a 1-cm grid comparable in 
texture and plant available nutrients to the study site (excavated at 
1–6 m depth from a former natural forest area near Spaubeek, the 
Netherlands). Four conditioned soil patches of 10 cm in diameter and 
18 cm deep per compartment were created (Figure 1A,B). Soil was 
conditioned in the greenhouse by growing each focal plant species 
on a mixture of sterile soil inoculated with 5% live soil from the field 
site (see Supplementary Methods). All four soil patches per compart-
ment received the same conditioned soil, which originated from one 
of the four focal species or a mixture of all four species-specific con-
ditioned soils as a control (Figure 1A,B). Species-specific conditioned

and Plantago lanceolata (red) were grown on a mixture of sterile soil with 5% inoculum soil from the field site (n = 60). Above-ground 
plant material was harvested, conditioned soils cut into 2–3 cm chunks and filled into four cylinders (20 cm diameter and 20 cm deep) in 
50 × 50 cm mesocosm container compartments surrounded by unconditioned soil. This was done for each species and for a mixture of all 
four conditioned soils as a control (dark grey; n = 10 for each species-specific soil, n = 8 for the mix soil), resulting in five different treatments 
with five different soil patches. (B) Soil around the patches was divided into cells of 5 × 5 cm2 each. In each cell, a single plant was placed; 
the conditioned soil patches were left empty. In the cells directly surrounding the patches (orange background colour), a single seedling of 
one of the four focal (A. odoratum—Ao; F. rubra—Fr; L. hispidus—Lh; P. lanceolata—Pl) and the four non-focal species (Achillea millefolium—Am; 
Agrostis capilaris—Ac; Nardus stricta—Ns; Veronica chamaedrys—Vc) was planted in a random order. In the cells further away from the soil 
patches (grey background colour), a single seedling of each of these species was planted randomly (represented by asterisks). The outermost 
cells, the buffer zone (white background), were randomly filled with several seedlings of each species (represented by asterisks). Above-
ground biomass was harvested per zone (inside soil patches, neighbouring cells, cells further away, buffer zone), and for the inside and 
neighbouring zones also per cell. Tracer solution was injected at four spots in each patch (red dots); soil cores for root quantification were 
taken inside each soil patch (black circle) [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]

soils were replicated 10 times and the mix soil eight times, result-
ing in 48 compartments. In the mesocosm facility, three sealed-off 
compartments were grouped together in a single container. The 16 
containers of this experiment were randomly placed in one line from 
North to South at the Radboud University Experimental Garden, 
Nijmegen, the Netherlands.
Each mesocosm compartment was divided into 10 × 10 cells of 
5 × 5 cm (Figure 1B). In July 2016, each cell was planted with a single 
seedling of one of the eight plant species with exception of the con-
ditioned soil patch; these were left empty. In the eight cells neigh-
bouring the soil patch, one seedling of each species was planted in 
a random order. Cells further away from the patch and in the buffer 
zone were planted with randomly chosen seedlings of the eight plant 
species (Figure 1B). Random planting took into account that no more 
than two seedlings of the same plant species were allowed to neigh-
bour each other to avoid formation of clusters consisting of the same 
plant species.
2.3 | Tracer recovery analysis
Nutrient tracers were injected in the conditioned soil patches in June 
2017 in one half of the replicates and in June 2018 in the other half 
(n = 4–5). A cocktail solution of the tracers 15N (99 atom% K15NO3; 
0.39 mM), lithium (LiCl; 0.08 M), rubidium (RbCl; 0.08 M) and stron-
tium (SrCl2·6H2O; 0.08 M) was added at four places in the middle 
of each soil patch following Hoekstra and colleagues (Hoekstra 
et al., 2014; Hoekstra, Suter, Finn, Husse, & Lüscher, 2015; Figure 1B). 
Four holes of 4 mm in diameter and 10 cm depth were made per soil 
patch, after which 2 × 6 ml tracer solution was slowly dripped in, dis-
tributing the tracer solution in the top 10 cm of the soil. Holes were 
subsequently closed by gently pushing the surrounding soil together. 
Tracer concentrations and volume were determined based on a pilot 
experiment in which the four tracers in the above concentrations 
were traced back in above-ground material of all eight plant species 
(data not shown). 15N tracer represents active nitrogen uptake, Li 
and Rb are analogues for uptake of positive, univalent ions (K+, Na+) 
and Sr for positive, divalent ions (Ca2+, Mg2+).
Above-ground plant biomass was cut at 3 cm above the soil to 
mimic mowing each September and each May/June comparable to 
practices at the field site. Before the first winter, in November 2016, 
an additional cut was done to avoid the large amount of biomass that 
had accumulated to decompose during autumn and winter. Biomass 
was collected per zone (inside, neighbouring, far away, buffer) and 
per plant species with exception of the buffer zone, which was col-
lected as a whole. For the inside and neighbouring zones, biomass 
was also collected for each soil patch separately (Figure 1B), resulting 
in 73 biomass fractions per compartment. Plant above-ground ma-
terial was dried at 70°C for at least 72 hr and weighed to determine 
dry mass. Tracer uptake (15N, Li, Rb and Sr) was measured in bio-
masses from September 2017 and 2018 from the inside, neighbour-
ing and far away zones (Figure  1B; see Supplementary Methods). 
15N tracer uptake per plant species was calculated by multiplying 
the 15N percentage of the plant material, the N percentage, the sam-
ple weight and the total above-ground biomass of the species in the 
respective zone. Li, Rb and Sr tracer uptake were calculated by multi-
plying the tracer concentration in the biomass material with the total 
above-ground biomass of the species in the respective zone. Tracer 
uptake for plant species in the further away zone was corrected for 
the number of planted individuals in July 2016 to achieve values for 
a single plant comparable to the other two zones. This was needed 
since the number of individuals per plant species in this zone dif-
fered between compartments due to the random planting scheme.
2.4 | Root sampling and sequencing
A soil core of 2.8 cm in diameter and 15 cm depth was taken from 
the middle of each conditioned soil patch in July 2017 for half of the 
replicates and in September 2018 in the other half of the replicates 
(n = 4–5; Figure 1B). The soil core was separated into two layers: 
0–5 cm and 5–15 cm. Cores from the four soil patches were pooled 
per compartment. Soil samples for nutrient analysis were taken from 
the 5–15 cm depth cores by thoroughly mixing the four samples per 
compartment and sieving out 25 g fresh soil. Plant available NO−
3, 
NH+
4, K+ and PO3−
4  were determined of these two points in time, as 
well as from the conditioned soils at the start of the experiment in 
September 2016 (see Supplementary Methods). Roots were washed 
from the soil cores using tap water and a sieve. A subsample of at 
least 100 mg dabbed dry roots was taken and frozen in liquid nitro-
gen. The remainder was dabbed dry, weighed and dried at 70°C for 
at least 72 hr. Total root biomass was calculated as the dry weight 
of the remainder plus the dry weight of the subsample based on the 
fresh/dry weight ratio of the remainder. Total root density was cal-
culated by dividing total root biomass by the volume of the soil core 
(30.8 cm3 for the 0–5 cm layer, 61.2 cm3 for the 5–15 cm layer).
The frozen root samples were freeze-dried for 18 hr, after which 
the dried material was ground to a fine powder (3 mm Tungsten car-
bide bead; Qiagen, with Retsch MM 200 mixer mill; Retsch GmbH). 
gDNA was subsequently extracted using the NucleoSpin 96 Plant 
II kit (Machery-Nagel) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 
gDNA libraries were then prepared largely in accordance with the 
genotype by sequencing (GBS) approach by Elshire et  al.  (2011; 
Wagemaker et al., in review). In short, genome complexity was re-
duced by digesting 300 ng gDNA by two restriction enzymes (PacI 
and NsiI) after which two indexed adapters were ligated to each 
gDNA fragment (Table S1). In contrast to Elshire et al. (2011), each 
adapter contained three unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) to iden-
tify PCR duplicates. Samples were pooled, mixed and divided into 
eight portions. These were concentrated (QIAquick; Qiagen) and 
fragment lengths were selected using a Blue pippin (Sage Science) 
2% agarose, 100–600 bp Size Selection Cassette to select in a range 
from 320 to 460 bp. After this, fragments were PCR amplified (KAPA 
HiFi HotStart readyMix; Roche Diagnostics), combined and concen-
trated (QIAquick; Qiagen). Products were qPCR quantified (KAPA 
Library Quantification Kit for HTS; KAPA Biosystems) and spiked

with 10% PhiX DNA to increase library complexity and improve se-
quence output quality. Samples were then sequenced on an Illumina 
HiseqX 2 × 150 bp sequencing (Novogene).
2.5 | Root density calculation
Root proportions were calculated according to Wagemaker et al. 
(in review) using a multispecies genotype by sequencing (msGBS) 
approach. This involved mapping of the multispecies root samples 
taken from the mesocosm compartments to a metareference ge-
nome sequence database which contained DNA clusters of each of 
the mesocosm plant species to determine the proportion of each 
species root material in the mesocosm root samples. This metaref-
erence was based on root material of each plant species sampled 
from a multispecies plant community consisting of all eight plant 
species that was grown in free-draining 12.7  L pots (top diam-
eter 29  cm, bottom diameter 24  cm, height 23  cm) in the same 
unconditioned soil and facility as the mesocosm experiment from 
September 2017 to September 2018 (n = 3). Roots of each species 
were obtained by digging out the plant, carefully washing the soil 
and loose roots away and collecting the root material attached to 
the shoot. gDNA was extracted, fragment lengths selected, librar-
ies prepared and sequenced in the same way as for the roots of the 
mesocosm experiment. We preferred material from multispecies 
communities instead of monocultures, because the monoculture 
approach resulted in skewed root distributions between the eight 
species in the main experiment (data not shown). The mapping 
procedure creates clusters of aligned sequences per plant spe-
cies that were calibrated using calibration samples consisting of all 
eight plant species roots in equal proportions (1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1 ratios 
based on root fresh weight; root material had same origin as for the 
species-specific reference libraries). This calibration corrects for 
variation in the number of sequence reads per plant species due 
to variation in gDNA extraction yield that resulted from variation 
in the species’ root cell size, genome size and ploidy level. Root 
density of each species was then calculated by multiplying the spe-
cies-specific proportion by the total root dry weight divided by the 
soil core volume. More details on the bioinformatic procedure can 
be found in the Supplementary Methods and msGBS scripts are 
available via Github (https://github.com/Niels​Wagem​aker/scrip​
ts_msGBS/​tree/msGBS​-1.0).
2.6 | Statistics
All statistics were performed in R version 3.6.0 (R Core Team, 2019) 
with model validations following recommendations of Zuur, Ieno, 
and Elphick (2010). All analyses of variance were performed using 
linear mixed effects models using lme from the nlme package 
(Pinheiro, Bates, DebRoy, Sarkar, & R Core Team, 2019). All models 
included compartment position in metres away from the most left 
compartment as a random effect to address spatial effects in the 
mesocosm set-up. Models testing the correlation between above-
ground biomass and tracer uptake included soil conditioning nested 
in compartment distance as a random effect to take replicates of 
the same treatment into account. Models testing correlations be-
tween SEM R2 and coefficients of variation (CV) were run with tracer 
type (15N, Li, Rb and Sr) as a random effect. In case of heterogeneity 
of variances, data weighting per plant species using varIdent from 
the nlme package was incorporated (Zuur, Ieno, Walker, Saveliev, 
& Smith,  2009). Data were ln-transformed when model residuals 
did not follow a normal distribution. Subsequent post hoc tests on 
lme models were performed using emmeans with the Tukey HSD 
method (Lenth, 2018). A priori tests were performed for each focal 
plant species and per soil layer using lme (Pinheiro et al., 2019) and 
glht of the multcomp package (Hothorn, Bretz, & Westfall, 2008) with 
predefined contrasts of ‘own’ versus ‘foreign’ soil.
2.7 | Structural equation modelling
We used SEM to test via which pathways conditioned soil affected 
root densities and tracer uptake in the soil patches. We chose a 
bottom-up approach in which we hypothesized that conditioned 
soil patches affected root densities inside the patches, poten-
tially cascading to effects on tracer uptake (15N, Li, Rb and Sr) 
of all individuals inside and surrounding the soil legacies (inside, 
neighbouring and far zone together). As a potential mechanism, we 
considered soil nutrient availability inside the soil patches at the 
moment of sampling and of the previous year as increased nutri-
ent availability commonly triggers local root proliferation in soil 
patches (Drew, 1975; Hodge, 2004; Hutchings & de Kroon, 1994; 
in ‘t Zandt et al.,  2015) and may affect high-affinity nutrient 
transporters (Gansel, Muños, Tillard, & Gojon,  2001; Thibaud 
et  al.,  2010). Soil nutrient availability in each model was repre-
sented by plant available NO−
3 and PO3−
4 , as these elements showed 
correlations with root density and tracer uptake (Table  S5) and 
are well known for triggering local root proliferation (Drew, 1975; 
Hodge, 2004; Hutchings & de Kroon, 1994; in ‘t Zandt et al., 2015). 
We tested this for each plant species in each year and for each 
tracer element, which resulted in 64 SEM models (each including 
all five soil conditioning treatments; n = 24).
Structural equation modelling were fitted using piecewis-
eSEM (Lefcheck,  2016) and lme of the nlme package (Pinheiro 
et al., 2019) with conditioned soil as random effect. Overall model 
fit was assessed using direct separation tests (d-sep) based on 
Fisher's C statistics with models being accepted if p > 0.07. We 
first evaluated the fit of our basic model including all pathways, 
then simplified each model using a backward stepwise elimina-
tion procedure (Ando, Utsumi, & Ohgushi, 2017; Matthews, Rigal, 
Triantis, & Whittaker, 2019). For this, the pathways with the high-
est p-values were consecutively dropped from the model, after 
which the model was evaluated using Fisher's C statistics and the

variables were, however, not allowed to drop completely from 
the model as this would unequivocally decrease AIC estimates. 
The model with the lowest AIC value was selected as the best 
fit model. Marginal R2 values describing variation explained by 
the fixed factors alone and residuals of the endogenous variables 
root density in both soil layers and tracer uptake were extracted 
from these best fit models, as well as effect sizes of each (margin-
ally) significant pathway (p < 0.07).
3 | RESULTS
3.1 | Conditioned soil patches affect species-
specific root densities
We grew eight grassland species in communities and created soil 
patches containing plant species-specific conditioned soil. Total 
root densities in these patches (expressed as root biomass per 
unit soil volume) were overall high and increased even further be-
tween 2017 and 2018 in the 0–5 cm of the soil patch, but not in the 
5–15 cm of the patch. Soil patches did not significantly affect total 
root density in either soil layer or in any year (Figure S1). Species-
specific root densities, however, differed significantly per species 
and per year in both soil layers (Table 1; Figure 2A,B). These pat-
terns correlated to above-ground biomass indicating that larger 
plant species generally had a higher root density inside the soil 
patches (data not shown).
Soil patch conditioning affected species’ root densities sig-
nificantly and depended on the plant species (Table 1). However, 
these differences were small compared to species and year effects 
and mainly occurred in the first growing season, that is, the year 
2017 (Figure  2A,B). Contrary to our expectations, a priori tests 
indicated that in both soil layers, root densities in own and for-
eign soil patches did not differ significantly for the focal plant spe-
cies, except for Anthoxanthum in the 0–5 cm of the soil in 2017 
(Figure 2A,B). In this single case, however, root density on own, 
Anthoxanthum soil was as low as on foreign, Festuca soil, showing 
a separation between grass and forb soil rather than between own 
and foreign soil (Figure 2A).
3.2 | Subtle effects of conditioned soil patches on 
tracer uptake
We injected a tracer cocktail solution (15N, Li, Rb, Sr) in the middle 
of each soil patch in June 2017 and 2018 and analysed tracer up-
take in above-ground biomass collected in September of both years 
in the inside, neighbouring and further away zones from the patch 
(Figure 1B). Plants neighbouring the soil patches took up, on aver-
age, 37% of the total recovered tracers, plants further away from the 
patch, on average, 54% and plants inside the soil legacy spots less 
than 0.1%. This was mostly due to differences in plant size, as tracer 
concentrations were generally highest in plant material from inside 
the soil patches and lowest in plants growing further away from the 
patch (data not shown). In all three zones, uptake of the four dif-
ferent tracers was significantly, positively correlated to each other 
(data not shown), as well as to plant species above-ground biomass 
(Figure S2A,D), which indicates that larger species took up a larger 
proportion of each applied tracer.
Plants did not take up more tracer from soil patches with a foreign 
soil than from patches with own soil. Instead, uptake of all four trac-
ers in all three zones and in both years was most strongly affected by 
plant species identity (Table 2; Table S2–S4). Inside the soil patches, 
a priori tests on the focal species indicated that only Festuca plants 
in 2018 differed significantly in uptake of Rb, Li and Sr between own 
and foreign conditioned soil. In the neighbouring patch zone, tracer 
uptake from own and foreign soil patches only differed significantly 
for Li uptake of Festuca plants in both years (Figure 3; Figures S3–S5). 
In all these cases, however, uptake from the own soil was higher than 
from foreign conditioned soil patches (Figure 3; Figures S3–S5).
3.3 | Root densities and tracer uptake correlate to 
soil patch nutrient availability
Soil patches may not only differ in soil biota but also in plant avail-
able nutrients. At the start of the experiment in summer 2016, soil 
K+ availability differed significantly between the conditioned soils, 
but not NO−
3 and PO3−
4 . Over time, the differences in K+ availabil-
ity between conditioned soil patches weakened and soil patches

2018 (Figure 4). In most cases, the observed differences between 
nutrient availability in the soil patches in 2017 and 2018 were not 
significantly correlated to the initial differences in 2016 or showed a 
significant correlation with a low R2 (Figure S6).
Nutrient availability in the soil patches was significantly cor-
related to root density and tracer uptake depending on the nutrient 
(NO−

In 2017, these correlations generally only occurred in interaction 
with plant species. This was especially the case for NO−

in 2017, as well as for NO−

4  availability at the start of the 
experiment in 2016 (Table S5).

year for each applied tracer (Figure 5A). Our best fit SEM models 
explained 5%–85% of the variation in tracer uptake, and 1%–54% 
of the variation in root densities (Figure 5B,C; Figures S7 and S8). In 
most cases, this was not related to how much variation was present 
in the underlying tracer and root density data, indicating that the 
large variation in explanative power of the SEM models between 
different plant species was down to the variables taken into ac-
count and not due to the strength of soil patch effects (Figure S9). 
Explained variation and significant pathways were roughly similar 
between the four tracers, but not between the eight plant spe-
cies and 2 years (Figure 5B,C; Figures S7 and S8). In many cases, 
the variation explained in tracer uptake was dependent on how 
strong root density increased tracer uptake (pathways 1 and 2). 
These differences in root densities were only in a few cases un-
derlain by differences in soil nutrient availability (Figures S7 and 
S8). In several cases, soil nutrient availability added directly to 
the explained variation in tracer uptake. This was mainly the case 
for the grasses in 2017, in which tracer uptake of Anthoxanthum, 
Festuca and Agrostis was higher with a higher soil NO−
3 availability. 
For Nardus, tracer uptake was lower with a higher soil NO−
3 avail-
ability (Figure 5B,C; Figure S8). The residuals of tracer uptake and 
root densities from the SEMs did not show any significant patterns 
between conditioned soils, indicating that there were no underly-
ing patterns in tracer and root densities between own and foreign 
soil patches when correcting for soil nutrient availability effects 
(data not shown).

4 | DISCUSSION
In eight-species mesocosm plant communities, we introduced 
soil patches with different plant-soil legacies to test whether 
root colonization and patch utilization were consistent with the 
theoretical framework predicting that plants are more hampered 
by their own than by other conditioned soils (Bever, 1999, 2003; 
Bever et al., 1997, 2012). In contrast to our hypothesis, there was

soil patches at the start of the experiment

2017 and 2018. Soil patches contained 
conditioned soil of Anthoxanthum

no clear distinction between own and foreign soil patches for any 
of the plant species. Root exploration of patches containing own 
soil, that is, soil conditioned by the same plant species, was not 
lower than root exploration of soil patches conditioned by another 
species. Similarly, uptake of any of the injected tracer elements 
into the soil patches by plants growing inside and surrounding the 
patches was not lower when the patch contained own soil com-
pared to foreign soil. Our approach to soil conditioning was simi-
lar to that of common controlled plant-soil feedback experiments 
(Brinkman, van der Putten, Bakker, & Verhoeven, 2010). Moreover, 
based on a literature search, similar negative own soil effects of 
the four plant species chosen here were to be expected. All four 
plant species namely showed, on average, negative effects on 
own soil compared to foreign conditioned soil across various inde-
pendent greenhouse experiments (Figure 6A). Similarly, negative 
effects of own conditioned soil were to be expected on plant spe-
cies root exploration and utilization of conditioned soil patches, 
that is, the parameters determined in the current study. Controlled 
experiments indicated for three of our focal species that nega-
tive own soil effects also occur on root exploration and utilization 
of conditioned soil patches (Figure 6B,C; Hendriks, Visser, et al., 
2015). Placing similarly conditioned soils in a semi-field setting 
yielded discrepancies with these controlled experiments, indicat-
ing that soil legacy effects from controlled conditions cannot eas-
ily be translated to longer term semi-field situations.
Several studies have previously shown discrepancies be-
tween controlled soil legacy pot experiments and soil legacy 
(semi-)field experiments (Kivlin et al., 2018; Schittko et al., 2016; 
Stanescu & Maherali,  2017). Greenhouse experiments where 
usually single plants or multiple individuals of the same species 
are confined to pots of a single soil type, generally yield stronger, 
negative effect sizes of soil legacies compared to soil legacies in 
(semi-)field conditions (Kulmatiski et al., 2008). This may be be-
cause soil nutrient availability differences between conditioned 
soils are typically larger in controlled pot experiments than in 
(semi-)field settings. Moreover, soil legacy effects in (semi-)field 
experiments may be downsized by a multitude of complicating 
factors such as multispecies interactions (Kulmatiski et al., 2008; 
Lekberg et al., 2018), seasonal changes differentially affecting (a)
biotic soil properties, plant growth and life stages (Dudenhöffer, 
Ebeling, Klein, & Wagg, 2018), decomposition and mineralization 
processes (Zhang, Li, Wu, & Hu,  2019; Zhang, van der Putten, 
& Veen, 2016) and below- and above-ground effects of higher 
trophic levels (Bezemer et al., 2010; Kos, Tuijl, de Roo, Mulder, & 
Bezemer, 2015a, 2015b; Schittko et al., 2016). As a result, the ex-
pected biotic soil legacy effect may be more condensed in con-
trolled greenhouse experiments than in (semi-)field conditions 
where soil biotic communities may be more diverse and variable 
over time (Kulmatiski et al., 2008). In line with this, Kulmatiski 
and Beard (2011) suggested that soil legacy effects in (semi-)
field settings may take more time to accumulate than gener-
ally assumed: years rather than months. This implies that small 
effect sizes in (semi-)field experiments may accumulate over 
time. However, we found that also initial effects did not match

expectations based on controlled experiments (Figure  6A,C), 
indicating that also the direction of these effects would need 
to change through time. Moreover, Heinen et al. (2020) showed 
that fungal pathogens may also decrease over time. Long-term 
experiments have to determine how soil legacy effects change 
through time and how short-term greenhouse estimates repre-
sent (semi-)field soil legacy effects.
Conditioned soil patch effects were plant species depen-
dent and partially underlain by soil nutrient availability, even 
though nutrient availability differences between conditioned 
soils were small. Importantly, the differences in nutrient avail-
ability in the soil patches in 2017 and 2018 were not compa-
rable to initial (after the conditioning phase; 2016) differences 
in soil nutrient availability and, therefore, likely resulted from 
differences in decomposition and mineralization processes over 
time (Kaisermann, de Vries, Griffiths, & Bardgett, 2017; Zhang 
et al., 2016, 2019). Indeed, Bezemer et al. (2010) showed that soil 
N mineralization played an important role in the species-specific 
soil food webs that plants developed in the field. However, we 
found that soil nutrient availability effects on root density did 
often not cascade into an effect on tracer uptake. Additionally, 
explained variation of root densities and tracer uptake by soil 
nutrient availability was often low, suggesting that other factors 
played a role as well. Soil biota was likely such an additional fac-
tor, indicating that plant species may actively favour or disfavour 
certain soil legacy patches via root proliferation responses, but 
not necessarily following the trends of controlled experiments. 
Conversely, differing root densities may be an effect of antag-
onistic soil biota activity, damaging roots and averting root de-
velopment in soil legacy patches. Soil legacy effects are thus 
inextricably connected to soil nutrient cycling, indicating that 
soil nutrient availability likely together with soil biota underlay 
soil legacy effects on patch exploration and utilization in our 
multispecies plant community.
5 | CONCLUSIONS
Our findings highlight the inconsistency of plant-soil legacy effects be-
tween controlled plant-soil feedback experiments and (semi-)field set-
tings. Among the many complicating factors that may modify or even 
overrule soil legacy effects in (semi-)field conditions, we identified 
soil nutrient availability as a critical, yet often overlooked component. 
Plant-soil legacy effects are often assumed to be underlain by soil 
biota effects; however, in our semi-field experiment, we found that 
soil nutrient availability was inextricably connected with effects of soil 
legacy patches. To move forward in soil legacy research, the gap be-
tween controlled and (semi-)field experiments needs to be closed. For 
this, it is imperative to understand the effects of soil legacies on soil 
nutrient cycling processes such as decomposition and mineralization 
and the subsequent effects on plant performance. Moreover, studies 
need to address soil nutrient availability effects and, where possible, 
correct for these to avoid overestimating soil biota effects. It will be 
challenging to understand the effects of soil legacies in multispecies 
plant communities, but this is a necessary step in our understanding to 
disentangle mechanisms of plant species coexistence.
