Abstract
Background: The transition from land to sea by the ancestor of cetaceans approximately 50 million years ago was an
incredible evolutionary event that led to a series of morphological, physiological, and behavioral adaptations. During
this transition, bone microstructure evolved from the typical terrestrial form to the specialized structure found in
modern cetaceans. While the bone microstructure of mammals has been documented before, investigations of its
genetic basis lag behind. The increasing number of cetaceans with whole-genome sequences available may shed light
on the mechanism underlying bone microstructure evolution as a result of land to water transitions.
Results: Cetacean bone microstructure is consistent with their diverse ecological behaviors. Molecular evolution was
assessed by correlating bone microstructure and gene substitution rates in terrestrial and aquatic species, and by
detecting genes under positive selection along ancestral branches of cetaceans. We found that: 1) Genes involved in
osteoclast function are under accelerated evolution in cetaceans, suggestive of important roles in bone remodeling
during the adaptation to an aquatic environment; 2) Genes in the Wnt pathway critical for bone development and
homeostasis show evidence of divergent evolution in cetaceans; 3) Several genes encoding bone collagens are under
selective pressure in cetaceans.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that evolutionary pressures have shaped the bone microstructure of cetaceans, to
facilitate life in diverse aquatic environments.

Background
A bony skeleton is vital to many adaptive phenotypes in
vertebrates and represented a major leap in evolution
[1]. The microstructure and organization in bone reflects
the biomechanical constraints that organisms undergo
and generally show a strong ecological signal [2–5].
Bone microstructure has been used to infer the habitat
and locomotor mode of extinct taxa, as well as to assess
the ecological, biomechanical, and phylogenetic signifi-
cance of bone microstructure of aquatic amniote groups
[2, 4, 6–8]. Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises)
are the most speciose order of marine mammals (~ 89
extant species in 14 families) and inhabit diverse habitats,
including ocean basins and large riverine ecosystems [9].
Extant cetaceans exhibit osteological adaptations to an
aquatic lifestyle, accompanied with complex buoyancy
control systems [10–13]. Taken together, cetaceans repre-
sent a model group for the study of bone microstructure
adaptations by ecological transition.
Extensive anatomical records on bone microstructure
exist. The link between bone microanatomy (e.g. limbs,
vertebrae, and ribs) and habitat has been studied by vari-
ous investigators [8, 10, 11, 13–19]. In general, flying
taxa (e.g. bats) exhibit a ‘simple’ bone microanatomy,
with thin cortices and few trabeculae in the medullary
region [20]. Terrestrial mammals usually display an
intermediate cortical thickness compared to aquatic
mammals [19]. The specialized bone microstructure in
most extant whale exhibits a thin layer of compact cor-
tex,
lacks
a
medulla,

‘osteoporotic-like’ but without bone mass decrease or
any pathological connotation [2]. Other types of bone
microstructure, such as non-pathological densification
(osteosclerosis) and swelling (pachyostosis) with in-
creased bone density, are observed in relatively inactive
shallow water dwellers such as Sirenia and Archaeocetes
[8, 10, 21]. These specializations have been attributed to
hydrodynamic or hydrostatic control of buoyancy, as
well as diving and swimming [10, 22, 23].
The bony skeleton of vertebrates is a dynamic and meta-
bolically living organ constituted primarily of calcium-
phosphate minerals and type I collagen. The growth of
bones is sculpted by modeling and continuously renewed
by remodeling [1]. The bone remodeling process, which
occurs throughout a lifetime to maintain mineral homeo-
stasis, involves timed expression of osteoclasts and osteo-
blasts to balance the bone matrix [24]. Multiple genes
and/or pathways must have been involved in the genetic
adaption of bone microstructure in aquatic mammals.
However, unlike the relatively well documented morpho-
logical changes of bone microstructure in cetaceans, the
underlying genetic basis has not been well addressed in
the literature. Multiple cetacean genomes are now avail-
able, allowing this question to be answered. To examine
the evolution of bone microstructure in cetaceans, we
contrasted the bone microstructure of cetaceans to other
mammals and identified associated gene-phenotype corre-
lations, and assessed the selective pressure of bone-
remodeling genes on the ancestral lineage of cetaceans.
Methods
Sample collection and bone microstructure
measurements
Anatomical data on bone microstructures (ribs 82 spe-
cies, humeri of 14 species, and vertebrae of 50 species)
(Additional file 1: Table S1–3) were obtained from two
ways: (1) We collected and generated rib and humerus
data from eight cetaceans and four adult terrestrial
mammals in our lab – the false killer whale (Pseudorca
crassidens), long-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus
capensis),
minke
whale
(Balaenoptera
acutorostrata
scammony),
pantropical
spotted
dolphin

(Lipotes

finless
porpoise
(Neophocaena
asiaeorientalis), common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops
truncatus), cow (Bos taurus), pig (Sus scrofa), sheep
(Ovis aries), and dog (Canis lupus familiaris). Only dead
stranding cetaceans for unknown reason in the wild was
used in this study, and other mammal bone tissues were
purchased in the market. No ethical approval was re-
quired. Bone sections were prepared as outlined by
Canoville et al. and by Hayashi and colleagues [12, 19]
(Fig. 1a). (2) To improve the sample size, sample images
and information of more species was retrieved from pre-
vious various studies [2, 6, 12, 13, 19, 25].
We employed binary images of thin sections and
assessed bone density using Bone Profiler [25], to obtain
the variables S (relative width of the transition zone be-
tween the medullary and the cortical regions) and P
(proportional to the size of the medullary cavity) for
each section. The compactness of the center/periphery/
whole of bone sections was calculated using Image-Pro
Plus, to obtain the variables Cg (globe compactness, ran-
ging from 0 ~ 1), Cc (compactness in the center of the sec-
tion. Cc values > 0 usually indicates the presence of
trabeculae in the center of a section), and Cp (compact-
ness in the periphery of a section. Cp values < 1 indicates
that the cortical region displays porosity). All of these vari-
ables represent the proportion of mineralized bone tissue
occupying the total sectional area (Fig. 1b). The parameter
MD is the maximal diameter of bone section that can be
used as a proxy for body size in statistical analysis of rib
and humerus microanatomical data [6, 19].
Measurements of vertebrae from 50 species were re-
trieved from Houssaye and colleagues [17]. Measure-
ments where more than half of the values were missing
were excluded from our analysis. We included nine vari-
ables in the subsequent analyses: Cls (global compact-
ness of the centrum in longitudinal section), CtsC
(centrum compactness in transverse section), TNCL
(total number of cavities in longitudinal section), NTCL
(number of trabeculae in the centrum longitudinal sec-
tion), AMCT (absolute mean cortical thickness in trans-
verse section), RMCT (relative mean cortical thickness
in transverse section), AMTT (absolute mean trabecular
thickness), RMTT (relative mean trabecular thickness)
and CL (centrum length used as proxy of body size in
statistical analysis of vertebrae microanatomical data).
Statistical analysis of bone microanatomical data
Principal component analysis (PCA) was employed in
order to reduce the dimensions of vertebrae indices. Vpc1
and Vpc2 (the first two principal components) explained
79% of the total variance (53 and 26%, respectively) of ver-
tebrae compactness. Thus, Vpc1 and Vpc2 for vertebrae,
and S, P, Cc, Cp, and Cg for rib variables were next used
in phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) multiple
regression against body size variables (CL and MD for ver-
tebrae
and
rib
variables,
respectively).
Phylogenetic
ANOVA analysis were employed to assess differences be-
tween habitat of bone variables for humerus, rib, and ver-
tebrae using the ‘phytools’ package in R [26].
For the rib data set (n = 82), we further divided aquatic
habitat species into shallow water/coastal water swim-
mers, and deep divers based on ecological behavior char-
acteristics and diving depth data [27]. To assess bone
histological parameters of 24 marine mammals we com-
pared the S/P/Cc/Cp/Cg of ribs in six habitat categories
in box plot and performed PGLS regression analysis of
these variables against diving depth (in meters).
Orthologous preparation and phylogenetic comparative
analyses
Of the species used in the quantitative analysis of bone mi-
croanatomy, 27 (or a related species in the same family or
similar habitat or locomotion) had corresponding whole-
genome sequences (Fig. 2). We generated three bone
microstructure data sets: ribs for 27 species, humeri for 14
species, and vertebrae for 13 species (Additional file 1:
Table S4). We next obtained genome sequences from NCBI
and obtained 1:1 orthologous genes among them using
OrthoMCL v2.0.9 [28]. Of 3621 single-copy orthologs, 348
were classified as bone function-associated genes based on
GO terms (‘skeletal system development’, ‘ossification’,
‘bone remodeling’, ‘osteoblast proliferation’, ‘osteoclast dif-
ferentiation’, and ‘osteoclast proliferation’), KEGG pathway
names (‘osteoclast differentiation’), and a literature survey
(key words ‘bone development’ and/or ‘osteoclast’) [29, 30].
Multiple alignments of orthologous sequences were gener-
ated using PRANK v150803 [31], followed by Gblocks
v0.91b [32] and manual curation of alignments.
The ‘root-to-tip’ dN/dS, defined as the average value of ac-
cumulated dN/dS extending from the last common ancestor
of all mammals examined to the respective terminal branch,
was estimated with PAML v4.4 [33] using a free-ratio model
and parsed using custom Perl scripts. This measurement
has been recognized as an index of selection which takes the
entire evolutionary history of a lineage from a common an-
cestor into account and negates the issue of temporal effects
on dN/dS [34]. Regression between ‘root-to-tip’ dN/dS and
bone histological parameters was assessed using PGLS re-
gression models under a phylogenetic framework across
mammals (using the R package ‘caper’ v0.5.2) [35]. Topology
and divergence date of a 27-species phylogenetic tree was
obtained from the online resource TimeTree [36]. Briefly,
PGLS employs a phylogenetic tree as input to assess the im-
pact of phylogenetic non-independence between species.
For every regression analysis, a quantitative measure of
phylogenetic signal (Pagel’s lambda; λ) is calculated through
maximum likelihood estimations. A λ value of 1, of or near

etic signal [37, 38]. To obtain more stringent correl-

P
values,
we
further
employed
a
two-step
verification procedure [39]. On the basis of ‘P value.all’
from the regression analyses for all samples, the follow-
ing two P values were calculated: 1) ‘P value.robust’
from PGLS repeated after excluding the sample with
largest residual error; 2) ‘P value.max’ from the re-
gression on the remaining species, to calculate the
maximal P value after dropping one species.
Estimating selective pressure
To identify genes that had been under selection, we set
the ancestral branch of cetaceans as the foreground
branch. Two models, the branch-site model [40] and
clade model C [41], were implemented using codeml in
PAML v4.4 [33]. The P value of each gene was com-
puted using likelihood ratio tests (LRTs). The clade
model C can detect evidence of divergent selective pres-
sures acting across the cetacean clade as the foreground
compared with the remaining species in the tree as the
background. We set each model with three initial ω
values (0.5, 1, and 1.5), to obtain the robust average ω,
and compared this result with model M2a_ref (nearly
neutral) via LRTs. Only genes with a unchangeable like-
lihood value for three initial ω values were considered
interesting. To identify associations between genes, we
implemented STRING (v10.5) functional analysis [42].
STRING integrates predicted and experimentally con-
firmed relationships between proteins that are likely to
contribute to a common biological purpose.

Results
Ecological signals of bone microstructure across
mammals
For three anatomical datasets (Additional file 1: Table S1–
3), significant positive correlations were found between
body size and the rib variables Cc (P = 3.9 × 10−9, r2 =
0.35), Cp (P = 1.03 × 10−3, r2 = 0.16), S (P = 2.15 × 10−10,
r2 = 0.39), and between body size and the vertebrae vari-
able Vpc1 (P = 2.2 × 10−16, r2 = 0.76) (Additional file 2:
Figure S1). We classified habitats into five categories
(aquatic, amphibious, arboreal, terrestrial, and flying. For
the humerus, only aquatic and terrestrial were consid-
ered). Phylogenetic ANOVA analysis showed that the
aquatic group was significantly different from other
groups in terms of S, Cc, and Cp (P < 0.01 in rib; P < 0.05
in humerus) (Additional file 2: Table S5).
Of the 24 marine mammals examined in rib data
set (Additional file 1: Table S1), deep divers (false
killer whale, Pseudorca crassidens; narwhal, Monodon
monoceros;
Blainville’s
beaked
whale,
Mesoplodon
densirostris;
long-finned
pilot
whale,
Globicephala
melas; and hooded seal, Cystophora cristata) had
lower Cp, Cc, S and Cg, and higher P (Additional file
2:
Figure
S2
and
S3).
Additionally,
diving
depth
(max/average) significantly correlated with Cp (max
depth; P < 0.05, r2 = 0.13; average depth; P < 0.05,
r2 = 0.13) and Cg (max depth; P < 0.05, r2 = 0.13;
average depth; P < 0.05, r2 = 0.19) (Additional file 2:
Figure S4), suggesting that deep-diving species have a
lower bone density. For example, the hooded seal (C.
cristata) and Blainville’s beaked whale (M. densiros-
tris) exhibited low global compactness and numerous
thin bone trabeculae.
Detection of selective pressure and gene–phenotype
association analysis
The branch-site model was used to identify positively se-
lected genes in a 27-species data set with genome and
corresponding bone microstructure measurements (see
Additional file 1: Table S4 and Fig. 2). Nine genes
(COL1A2,
COL3A1,
FSHR,
IFNAR1,
MEPE,
MITF,
NFATC3, TEC, and TNFRSF1A) showed evidence of
strong positive selection (likelihood ratio tests, LRTs P <
0.05) in the common ancestor of cetaceans. A total of 14
genes (SPARC, COL2A1, COL9A1, COL5A2, COL3A1,
HES1, CTNNB1, FZD4, RUNX2, DVL3, TEC, FOSL1,
STAT1, and LCP2) showed significant positive selection
in cetaceans but not in the outgroup taxa (foreground
ω2 > 1.00 and background ω1 < 1.00, LRT P < 0.05).
Interestingly,
assessment
for
divergent
evolution
(clade model C) identified genes related to ‘Wnt sig-
naling’ and ‘regulation of osteoblasts’ (Table 1 and
see Additional file 3: Table S6–7).
A comparison of ‘root-to-tip’ dN/dS values (see Additional
file 1: Table S4) and bone measurements from the ribs (27
species), humeri (14 species), and vertebrae (13 species) re-
vealed 83 genes with substitution rates correlating with bone
variables (see Additional file 4: Table S8–10). Since body size
correlated positively with several variables (S, Cc, and Cp for
rib; Vpc1 for vertebrae) (Additional file 2: Figure S1), variable
residuals were computed to account for body size influence
on regression and employed in a new round of regression
analysis. For the variables Cc and Cp, 83% of genes were sig-
nificant or near significant (P value.all for residual < 0.1),
while one gene was detected near significant each for the var-
iables S (S ~ NCF2: P value.all for residual = 0.08) and Vpc1
(vpc1~SYK: P value.all for residual = 0.083) (Additional file 4:
Table S8). Of the 83 genes, 27 genes are associated with the
KEGG pathway ‘Osteoclast differentiation’ (P < 0.1) (Fig. 3)
and six were with ‘Phagosome’ (P < 0.01) (see Additional file 5:
Table
S11–12).
Moreover,
six
genes
(PIK3CB,
NGF,
MAPK13, TNFRSF11B, NCF2, and IFNGR2) associated with
the osteoclast differentiation pathway showed a significant
correlation with two out of three bone types (Fig. 4a). Four
genes (MITF, TNFRSF1A, TEC, and IFNAR1) in the osteo-
clast differentiation pathway were identified by the branch
site model, suggesting that they have undergone positive se-
lection in cetaceans. Additionally, clade model C revealed
that four genes (STAT1, TEC, LCP2, and FOSL1) have been
subject to divergent selection pressures in cetaceans com-
pared to other taxa (Fig. 3 and 4a; Table 1). With the
exception of TNFRSF1A (TNF receptor superfamily
member 1A), 26 genes enriched for the osteoclast
differentiation pathway showed a negative correlation
between ‘root-to-tip’ dN/dS and Cp and a positive
correlation
between
‘root-to-tip’
dN/dS
and
bone
indices Cc and S, (Fig. 4b). Thus, genes associated
with
osteoclast
function
have
evolved
rapidly
in
aquatic mammals.
The association of ‘root-to-tip’ dN/dS with bone mass
parameters and the selective pressure analysis both iden-
tified several genes which encode collagen proteins
(Table 1 and Fig. 4a), essential components of bone and
cartilage and required for endochondral ossification. For
example,
genes
encoding
type
I
and
III
collagens
(COL1A2 and COL3A1) were under positive selection in the
ancestral lineage of cetaceans. Although our two-step verifi-
cation procedure (see [39]) revealed a relationship between
S and Cc vs dN/dS of COL1A2 (Cc: P value.all = 0.002, P
value.robust = 0.001, P value.max = 0.002; S: P value.all =
0.004, P value.robust = 0.007, P value.max = 0.049), this was
not significant in regression analyses where variable resid-
uals were employed to account for body size (Cc: P = 0.305;
S: P = 0.238). Furthermore, the divergent selection scan
showed that type II, V, and IX collagens (COL2A1, COL5A2
and COL9A1) and osteonectin (SPARC) were also under
positive selection in extant cetaceans.

Discussion
Bone microstructure in cetaceans with diverse ecological
behaviors
Anatomical records from marine mammals (16 ceta-
ceans, seven pinnipeds, and the sea otter) allowed us to
address the great diversity of bone microstructure in
marine mammals, especially for the fully aquatic ceta-
ceans. Combining qualitative data and statistical ana-
lyses, we reveal that whole bone volume (Cg) does not
scale substantially with habitat or body size. Mammals
with a larger body size tend to have a more complex
organization, with an increased transition zone (S) be-
tween the cortical bone and the medullary cavity, as well
as numerous bone trabeculae occupying the medullary
region (also called cancellous bone; Cc). For animals
from different categories of habitats, the compactness of
cortical bone (Cp) is relatively low in aquatic mammals,
especially in deep-diving whales. Cortical bone is dense
and strong enough to provide both support and protec-
tion for most mammals. However, for cetaceans, who
harbor a more porous bone structure, it seems that the
trabecular bone tends to invade into the cortical bone –
as evidenced by higher S and Cc values. It is generally
accepted that the trabecular bone is more responsive to,
and malleable for, variations in magnitude and direction
of load throughout life compared to cortical bone [59].
Therefore, this pattern of bone microstructure may be
an adaptation for the aquatic lifestyle of cetaceans.

The inner bone structure within cetaceans is variable,
especially in the case of the ribs. It has been assumed
that ribs contribute significantly to the mass and inertia
of the body in these “limbless” mammals [19]. Compared
to most terrestrial mammals, which have a fully compact
cortical bone, cetaceans display porosity (lower Cp).
Some cetaceans in the Delphinidae and Monodontidae
families exhibit unexpectedly thick cortices, with a cer-
tain extent of porosity and thicker bone trabeculae in
the medullary region. This could be because an in-
creased bone density supports feats such as the acrobat-
ics and fast swimming speed of dolphins and feeding in
deep divers [60, 61]. Another interesting observation is
that species which reside in shallow freshwater, such as
baiji (Lipotes vexillifer) and boto (Inia geoffrensis), have a
spongy section with numerous thin bone trabeculae and a
low global compactness (Cg). Although the function of
this modification is unknown, it may support relatively
lower buoyancy in a freshwater habitat.
Accelerated evolution of osteoclast differentiation-related
genes in cetaceans
Previous studies suggested that down- and up-regulation
of osteoclast activity was central to bone microstructure
of tetrapods returning to an aquatic environment [10].
Our results reveal a positive correlation to S or Cc and
negative correlation to Cp by genes in the osteoclast dif-
ferentiation pathway. Since aquatic mammals had a rela-
tively higher S and Cc, and a lower Cp, genes with
higher ‘root-to-tip’ dN/dS values in cetaceans could re-
flect accelerated evolution of osteoclastogenesis.
Most of the positively selected genes (e.g., TEC, LCP2,
TRAF2, MITF, CTSK, LCK, and GRB2) in the ancestral
branch of cetaceans are genes with ‘root-to-tip’ dN/dS
that negatively correlate with Cp. These genes encode
intracellular signaling cascade proteins involved in osteo-
clast differentiation (see Fig. 4b and Table 1). Mutations in,
or the lack of any of these, genes would cause severe osteo-
petrosis [54, 57, 62–64]. The genes (IFNAR1, TNFRSF1A,
TNFRSF11B, TNFSF11, and TGFB2) in the osteoclast differ-
entiation pathway are ligands or receptors that trigger the
differentiation process of osteoclasts (Fig. 3 and Table 1).
Two genes have a negative impact on osteoclast differenti-
ation. The ‘root-to-tip’ dN/dS of TNFRSF11B (osteoproteg-
erin; also known as OPG) positively correlated with Cc in
both rib (P value.robust < 3.89 × 10−06, r2 = 0.91) and hu-
merus (P value.robust < 2.10 × 10−06, r2 = 0.6), while
TNFSF11 (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B lig-
and; also known as RANKL) negatively correlated to Vpc2 in
vertebrae (P value.robust < 1.61 × 10−04, r2 = 0.75). In

GWAS meta-analyses these genes were associated with
volumetric bone mineral density, suggesting that the RANK-
RANKL-OPG axis affects the skeleton – at least in part by
influencing the density of cortical bone [65]. Another posi-
tively selected gene in the cetacean lineage of interest is
TNFRSF1A (also known as TNFR1), the only gene with a
‘root-to-tip’ dN/dS negatively correlated with Cc (P value.ro-
bust = 3.93 × 10−05, r2 = 0.49). TNFRSF1A is the receptor of
TNF-α and modulates immune and inflammatory processes,
as well as bone homeostasis [58]. Cross-talk between inter-
ferons and other cytokines in bone remodeling have recently
received greater attention. For example, one of the IFN-β re-
ceptor components in the type I interferon system is
IFNAR1 (Table 1). Ifnar1−/−mice have markedly reduced
trabecular bone mass, a key feature of osteoporosis, suggest-
ing that the gene plays a critical role in osteoclastogenesis
[56]. We hypothesize that bone homeostasis in aquatic
mammals is maintained by the RANK-RANKL-OPG axis
acting in concert with cytokines.
In summary, we have identified a correlation between
accelerated changes of osteoclast-associated genes and
increased trabeculae in cetaceans. This correlation could
reflect increased bone resorption. Further analyses of se-
lective pressure suggest that several genes related to
osteoclast differentiation underwent accelerated change
due to positive selection, likely to allow bone micro-
structure specialization in cetaceans.
Divergent selection of bone formation genes between
cetaceans and other mammals
Genes associated with ‘canonical Wnt signaling’ and
‘regulation of osteoblasts’ were shown to evolve through
divergent selection in cetaceans compared to other taxa
(Table 1). It is well known that Wnt signaling plays a
pivotal role in skeletal homeostasis by regulating bone
formation and bone resorption by osteoblasts and osteo-
clasts [43]. Genes associated with the Wnt intracellular
signaling (CTNNB1, FZD4, and DVL3) were under di-
vergent selection in cetaceans. Other genes under diver-
gent
selection
encode
transcription
factors.
This
includes RUNX2 which is essential for the maturation of
osteoblasts [50]. Knockout of RUNX2 in mice results in
a complete lack of bone formation and arrested osteo-
blast differentiation [66]. Moreover, studies of mouse
models with knockout or transgenic Wnt pathway
components have demonstrated that this signaling path-
way regulates most aspects of osteoblast physiology,
including
bone
matrix
formation/mineralization,

osteoclastogenesis, and bone resorption [43, 44]. Thus,
significant divergent selection of these genes between ce-
taceans and other mammals suggests that they played
crucial roles in driving the bone development and for-
mation in response to aquatic adaptations.
Positive selection of collagen genes in cetaceans
The matrix of bone mainly contains collagen fibers and
mineral deposits. Type I collagen in bone and type II
collagen in cartilage provide structural integrity and ac-
count for mechanical strength [67]. Osteogenesis imper-
fecta, a severe genetic disorder manifested by increased
bone fragility and low bone mass, is included in the dis-
eases associated with COL1A2 [46]. Alteration of colla-
gen structural properties by missense mutations in
COL1A1 and COL1A2 reduce the mechanical properties
of bone [68]. Moreover, cetacean COL1A2 harbors
unique substitutions that may modify the collagen triple
helix [69]. Nevertheless, the fact that COL1A2 and sev-
eral other genes mentioned before were not statistical
significant after correcting for body size residuals. Pos-
sible reasons may include sample size or ecological/stat-
istical implications for bone sample feature, e.g. only one
specific region of the rib series were sampled or intra-
specific microanatomical variability, which were men-
tioned in Canoville et al. (2016) [19]. Type III collagen
(COL3A1) showed a negative correlation between evolu-
tionary rate and Cc in cetaceans, as well as positive se-
lection and divergent selection in the ancestral lineage of
cetaceans. COL3A1 is highly expressed during embry-
onic skeletal development and expressed by osteoblasts
in mature bone. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments
have shown that COL3A1 plays an important role in the
development of trabecular bone through its effects on
osteoblast differentiation [70]. Loss of COL3A1 function
is associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), where
skeletal manifestations include a distinctive facial ap-
pearance, scoliosis, and osteoporosis [71]. Cartilaginous
collagen fibrils are represented by collagens type II, IX,
and XI and endochondral ossification is gradually re-
placed by a bone matrix composed of type I and type II
collagens [72]. Together with divergently selected osteo-
nectin (SPARC), a gene which encodes a protein that
bind to ECM proteins such as type I, III, IV, and V colla-
gens to promote bone mineralization [47, 73], we specu-
late that bone collagen are likely to have contributed
significantly to the specialization of cetaceans bone
microstructure.
Conclusions
Along with the transition of cetaceans from land to sea,
changes in habitats and ecological behaviors in cetaceans
resulted in diverse patterns of bone microstructures. In
the present study, we found that genes involved in
osteoclast differentiation experienced accelerated evolu-
tion in cetaceans. In addition, Wnt signaling and osteo-
blastogenesis associated with bone development were
found to be under divergent evolution in cetaceans. We
also detected positive selection of collagen proteins in
cetaceans. These findings provide new insights into the
nexus between genes and the secondary adaptation of
terrestrial mammals to aquatic life.
