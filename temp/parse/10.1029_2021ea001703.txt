1.  Introduction
During the Late Paleozoic, the supercontinent Gondwana was positioned over the South Pole and was af-
fected by one of the most significant glaciations in Earth’s history. Sedimentary records of this Late Paleozo-
ic Ice Age (LPIA) are widespread across the mid-latitude to high-latitude sedimentary basins of Gondwana 
(e.g., da Rosa et al., 2016; Fedorchuk et al., 2019; Isbell et al., 2003; Rosa et al., 2019; Santos et al., 1996; 
Scotese et al., 1999).
The Paraná Basin is the largest of the Late Paleozoic intraplate basins in South America: roughly NNE-SSW 
elongated, it comprises a widespread sedimentary-magmatic sequence that is up to ca. 7,000 m in thickness, 
containing one of the most extensive LPIA records. Glacial deposits are found within the Permo-Carbonif-
erous Itararé Group, which constitutes one of the largest units within the basin (França & Potter, 1988; Ro-
cha-Campos et al., 2008; Santos et al., 1996). The Itararé Group was deposited under mostly marine glacial 
and periglacial conditions, comprising several sedimentary facies. The Group is subdivided into the Lagoa 
Azul, Campo Mourão, and Taciba Formations (e.g., França & Potter, 1988) and represents glacial–subgla-
cial successions with transgressive shales at the top of each sequence, interpreted as sea-level rise during 
glacial melting. Lithologies of each formation comprise diamictites, sandstones, siltstones, shales, and con-
glomerates (França & Potter, 1988, 1991; Limarino & Spalletti, 2006; Rocha-Campos et al., 2008; Santos 
et al., 1996). In the northern part of the basin, true subglacial tillite deposition is rare (Arab et al., 2009), 
with the majority of the sandy deposits pertaining to proximal glacial-marine environments, and interpret-
ed as subaqueous outwash-fan apron deposits, grading laterally into diamictites and mudstones (Carvalho 
& Vesely, 2017; França & Vesely, 2007; Mottin et al., 2018). Mass transport of resedimented sediment results 
in massive diamictites, often developing into gravitational flows and occasional turbidites (França & Vese-
ly, 2007; Vesely et al., 2018). More distally, the sedimentation evolves to tractional flows plus suspension fall-
out of the abundant rhythmite sequences and to the shale deposits resulting from pure suspension (França 
& Vesely, 2007; Vesely et al., 2018).
Abstract  Sedimentary rocks of the Itararé Group, deposited during the Late Paleozoic Ice Age in the 
Paraná Basin of South America, were collected throughout the state of São Paulo, Brazil, for an anisotropy 
of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) and rock-magnetic study. A recent paleomagnetic study conducted on 
the same samples had determined that these rocks were largely remagnetized during the Cretaceous; 
however, rock-magnetic experiments demonstrate that the AMS is dominantly carried by paramagnetic 
minerals and therefore is unaffected by the secondary magnetic overprints. AMS data are analyzed in 
terms of their shape and orientation, and according to the relationship between the q-value (magnetic 
lineation/foliation) and the imbrication angle (β) of the minimum susceptibility axes with respect to 
bedding (q–β diagram). Using multiple lines of evidence, we demonstrate that AMS records primary 
sedimentary fabrics that reflect the depositional environments and paleocurrent conditions in which these 
rocks were deposited. The magnetic fabrics consistently record a SE-NW paleocurrent orientation, with 
dominant direction of transport to the NW throughout the entire state of São Paulo, in agreement with 
ice flow and sediment transport directions reported from limited numbers of sites possessing sedimentary 
structures and ice-kinematic indicators.

complex magnetic mineralogy and 
allows determining a dominantly 
paramagnetic origin for the AMS
•	 AMS analyses determine a dominant 
sedimentary transport direction to 
the NW and allow determining the

The correlation between outcrops and subsurface sections is not fully established (Rocha-Campos et al., 2008) 
and unlike the southern portion of the basin, there is no lateral continuity of the Itararé Group sedimentary 
facies to the north, particularly in the thick sequence within the state of São Paulo, hindering the establish-
ment of formal stratigraphic subunits and correlations (Arab et al., 2009). Furthermore, in the northern part 
of the Paraná Basin, the Itararé Group assumes a red coloration and is referred to as the Aquidauana For-
mation, however, the two are equivalent (Gesicki et al., 1998, 2002; Milani et al., 1994, 1998). Igneous rocks 
(lava flows, dykes, and sills) within the Itararé Group are not uncommon and are related to Triassic–Jurassic 
and the Early Cretaceous magmatic events associated with the opening of the South Atlantic (e.g., Abbott 
& Isley, 2002; C. C. Araújo et al., 2005; L. M. Araújo et al., 2000; Ernesto et al., 1999; Menezes & Travas-
sos, 2000; Milani & Zalán, 1999; Thomaz Filho et al., 2008) and are responsible for the remagnetization of 
the Itararé Group rocks (Bilardello et al., 2018).
Absolute U–Pb ages for the Itararé Group sedimentary rocks of 298.5 (±2.6) and ∼323 Ma from the lower 
Itararé Group were reported by Franco et al. (2012). The latter age is derived from a detrital zircon and 
represents an Upper Mississippian age limit. An U–Pb age of 267.1 (±3.4) from the overlying Rio Bonito 
Formation instead represents an age limit for the upper portion of the Itararé Group (Matos et al., 2001). Ac-
cording to Souza (2006), the oldest palynozone in the basal portion of the Itararé Group is Late Bashkirian 
(∼315–312 Ma), and Holz et al. (2010) also reported the Itararé as Bashkirian/Moscovian (∼312 Ma) to Ear-
ly Sakmarian (∼294 Ma). The palynological ages thus place the base of the Itararé as Early Pennsylvanian, 
whereas the absolute U–Pb ages could push the base into the Late Mississippian. The Late Carboniferous 
age of the Itararé is further supported by palynological correlation with Late Carboniferous strata in Argen-
tina, Africa, and Australia (Holz et al., 2010), as well as the U–Pb ages of 302.0–299.2 Ma from the African 
Karoo Supergroup (Bangert et al., 1999).
Structures associated with the LPIA glaciation occur throughout the Paraná Basin, with ice dynamics pri-
marily determined through striations and grooves on basement rocks (e.g., da Rosa et al., 2016; Gesicki 
et al., 2002; Rosa et al., 2019). Within the Itararé Group deposits, glacier kinematics have been inferred 
indirectly from paleocurrent trends in ice-distal facies (e.g., Arab et al., 2009; Carvalho & Vesely, 2017; da 
Rosa et al., 2016; Mottin et al., 2018) and directly from subglacial deformational structures (e.g., da Rosa 
et al., 2016; Gesicki et al., 2002; Rocha-Campos et al., 2000). Specific to the state of São Paulo, scarce direct 
evidence derived from landforms and striations arising from glacier movement at eight different sites con-
sistently indicates ice-flow direction to the NW (da Rosa et al., 2016, and references therein). The evidence 
collected, while consistent, is not ubiquitous throughout the state and confined to the sites where structures 
have been identified.
Here, we present paleocurrent direction results obtained from an extensive anisotropy of magnetic suscep-
tibility (AMS) study conducted on a variety of lithologies of the Itararé Group sedimentary rocks collected 
throughout the state of São Paulo that do not possess visible ice-flow indicators. Such detailed study, cou-
pled with extensive rock-magnetic evidence, compliments the more regional study of Raposo et al. (2020), 
which includes a partial set of the AMS data from São Paulo state presented here. The paleocurrent direc-
tions obtained from AMS are consistent with the direct observations of ice-flow kinematics and sediment 
transport. Additionally, we investigate the depositional environments of the Itararé Group rocks by means 
of the q–β empirical method of Taira (1989) that is based on AMS fabrics. Such analysis further proves that 
the magnetic fabrics are primary and were acquired under a range of sedimentary depositional regimes that 
are consistent with the sedimentary and stratigraphic interpretations.
2.  Materials and Methods
The Itararé Group sedimentary rocks were sampled at 33 different localities that span the eastern portion of 
the state of São Paulo from north to south and into the southernmost portion of the state of Minas Gerais. 
The collected sites comprise gray to tan-colored diamictites, fine yellow sands and siltstones, coarse sand, 
thinly laminated gray rhythmites, competent claystones, red mudstones, and red sandy mudstones. Geo-
graphic coordinates for the sampling sites are reported in table 1 and Figure 1, whereas selected field pho-
tographs of the sampled lithologies are shown in Figure 2. The collected sites consist of flat-laying deposits,

of 11 standard cylinders for an incompetent sandy red bed outcrop, to a maximum of 65 for the slumped 
shale outcrop sampled at site IT5, for which more detail was sought. Overall, an average of 36 specimens 
was investigated per site.
Rock-magnetic measurements on specimens from all sites were conducted at the Institute for Rock Mag-
netism, University of Minnesota. Hysteresis loops were measured on Princeton Measurements Corporation 
(Princeton, NJ, USA) 3900 MicroMag Vibrating Sample Magnetometers in fields up to 1 or 1.5 T. DC and 
AC magnetic experiments were conducted on Quantum Design (San Diego, CA, USA) Magnetic Properties 
Measurement Systems (MPMSs). DC experiments included measuring magnetic remanence upon heating 
from 20 K to room temperature after cooling in a 2.5 T field (field cooled remanence, FC), and after cooling 
in zero field but applying a saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (SIRM) of 2.5 T at 20 K (ze-
ro-field cooled remanence, ZFC). A room temperature (RT) 2.5 T SIRM was also applied and the remanence 
measured upon cooling to 20 K and warming back to room temperature (RTSIRM). The “goethite test” 
(e.g., Guyodo et al., 2006) was applied to selected specimens, whereby specimens were cooled from 400 to 
300 K in the presence of a 2.5 T field. The partial thermal remanent magnetization was then measured (in 
zero field) upon cooling and warming between 300–20–300 K (pTRM cooling and warming curves). The 
specimens were then taken out of the MPMS and AF demagnetized using 200 mT AC fields to eliminate 
the contribution of soft phases like magnetite and reinserted in the MPMS. The magnetic remanence was 
then thermally cycled between 300–20–400 K (post-AF cooling and warming curves) to thermally demag-
netize the contribution of goethite, and then again between 400–20–300 K (post-400 K cooling and warming 
curves). The last measurement cycle likely reflects the contribution of hematite only, and/or hard magnet-
ic phases with Curie temperatures higher than 400 K (e.g., nanomaghemite [Carter-Stiglitz et al., 2001;

and χ″, respectively, units of m3/kg) were measured as a function of frequency and temperature between 10 
and 300 K using seven frequencies logarithmically spaced between 1 and 1,000 Hz.
AMS measurements for specimens from sites IT1 through IT16 were performed at the Instituto de Ge-

3.  Results
3.1.  Low-Temperature Magnetometry
Low-temperature DC magnetic experiments conducted on representative specimens from all lithologies in-
dicate that for most specimens the FC and ZFC curves are separated at low temperature and upon warming 
join at ∼250 K or higher (Figures 3a and 3, left side panels). A few specimens exhibit little to no separation 
of the FC and ZFC curves, and these either decrease rapidly upon warming between low temperature and 
∼40 K, or more gradually to room temperature (Figures 3e and 3h, left side panels, respectively). The major-
ity of specimens possess FC-ZFC curves with an inflection around 120 K (Figures 3e–3h, left side panels). 
RTSIRM curves on cooling and warming always possess an inflection at ∼120 K (Figures 3a and 3, left side 
panels) and sometimes a higher temperature inflection ∼250–260 K (Figures 3f–3h, left side panels). The 
goethite tests reveal variable separation between the pTRM cooling and warming curves between 300 and 
∼120 K (Figures 3b–3d, left side panels). For all specimens, a considerable amount of remanence is removed 
by the AF demagnetization, while some remanence is removed by the 400 K thermal demagnetization (Fig-
ures 3b–3d, left side panels). After thermal demagnetization, an inflection around 230–250 K, sometimes 
accompanied by thermal hysteresis in the cooling–warming curves, is sometimes apparent in the final tem-
perature cycling (Figures 3b and 3d, left side panels).
In-phase AC susceptibility χ′ of all specimens is dominated by paramagnetic Curie–Weiss ∼1/T behavior. 
For many specimens, peaks occur between ∼200 and 240 K that also display frequency dependence (Fig-
ures 3b, 3c, 3f, and 3g, right side panels). Some specimens have peaks around 120 K (Figures 3g and 3f, 
right side panels), whereas one specimen has a prominent peak centered at 20 K (Figure 3g, right hand 
panel). Out-of-phase susceptibility χ″ has frequency-dependent peaks at similar 200–230 K temperatures 
as χʹ (Figures 3b, 3c, 3f, and 3g, right side panels), with one of the specimens displaying a ∼240 K χ″ peak 
that is absent in χʹ (Figure 3a, right side panel). Other specimens do not possess distinct peaks in χ″, but 
instead have a broad curvature that displays frequency dependence, albeit with some measurement noise, 
particularly at the highest frequencies (Figures 3d and 3h, right hand panel).
3.2.  Room Temperature Magnetic Hysteresis
Hysteresis loops measured at room temperature on representative specimens from each lithology are plot-
ted in Figure 4. Before paramagnetic slope correction the loops are narrow and pass through the origin, 
indicating little hysteresis and curvature. After correcting for the paramagnetic slope these loops indicate 
the weakest magnetizations overall. A small number of loops display increased curvature, but are also nar-
row, and reveal weak magnetizations after paramagnetic slope correction, for example the gray diamictite 
at site II6. Other loops, instead, are more open and often constricted at the origin (e.g., the brown diamictite 
at site II10, the red beds at site II13, the brown-tan rhythmite at site II20, and the white-pink sandstone

at site II12). Despite these loops indicating a distribution of ferrimagnetic coercivity, the intensities of the 
magnetizations at saturation remain low.
3.3.  Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility
The majority of sites possess bedding parallel magnetic fabrics, with subvertical minimum principal axes, 
K3, and subhorizontal intermediate and maximum principal axes, K2 and K1 (Figure 5a). Exceptions to the 
general trend are sites II5 and II14 that possess a strongly imbricated fabric with K3 axes plunging to the NW 
and NNW, respectively, and will be described in more detail below (Figures 5a, 5c, and 5d; Table 1). Sites 
II5 and II14 have been excluded from calculating a mean fabric. Likewise, site IT5 has also been exclud-
ed from the Group mean because it is affected by folding, as discussed below. At the Group level, K3 axes 
are somewhat girdled, with an elongation oriented NW-SE, whereas the K1 axes are somewhat dispersed 
within the horizontal plane with a preferred orientation of NW-SE (Figure 5b). On either a Flinn diagram 
(Flinn, 1978) or Jelinek plot (Jelinek, 1981), the shape of the fabrics for the individual site-mean fabrics/
lithologies is predominantly triaxial–oblate to oblate, with anisotropy varying between a few percent to 
under 25% (Figures 5c and 5d).

blocking temperature that do not coincide with either TM or TV (see text for details). Some dotted χ″ curves for the highest frequency measured indicate higher 
measurement noise that distracts from the general pattern.

A few sites possess triaxial fabrics, and, with the exception of sites II5 and II14 mentioned above, their 
site-mean fabrics possess subvertical K3 axes and subhorizontal K1 axes. Some examples of these are the 
slumped shale at site IT5, the tan and gray diamictites at sites IT3 and II7, and the pelodite at site IT6. In 
geographic coordinates, site IT5 possesses distinct principal axes orientation, with the K2 and K3 axes some-
what elongated toward each other, as reflected by their confidence ellipses and the triaxial shape of the 
site-mean fabric, when evaluating the cumulative distribution of the bootstrapped eigenvalues (Figure 6a). 
In stratigraphic coordinates, however, the K2 and K3 axes are truly girdled, and the shape of the site-mean 
fabric tends to prolate, though the cumulative distributions of the K2 and K3 eigenvalues remain distinct at 
the 95% confidence interval (Figure 6b). Site II5 represents 55 specimens collected from a flat-laying silt-
stone that is void of sedimentary structures. The fabric for II5 is triaxial-prolate, with distinct principal axes, 
and subhorizontal K1 axes and elongated K2 and K3 axes within the plane that contains them. The K3 axes 
plunge ∼40° to the NW (Figure 6c). The yellow-brown diamictite collected at site II14 has an AMS fabric 
characterized by K3 axes plunging ∼40° to the NNW and K1 axes plunging ∼50° to the SSE. The K2 and K3

principal axes are somewhat elongated toward each other, but their eigenvalues are distinct, defining a tri-
axial fabric that tends to prolate (Figure 6d). Examples of sites with triaxial, triaxial–oblate fabrics are from 
sites IT3 and II7. These have bedding parallel to slightly imbricated fabric orientations, with well-grouped 
principal axes and K1 and K2 axes distributed within the plane that contains them (Figure 6e), similarly 
to the predominant sites with oblate, triaxial–oblate fabrics (Figure 5). The pelodite at site IT6, a lithified 
resedimented glacial flour, is flat-laying, undeformed, and void of sedimentary structures, yet its magnetic 
fabric is triaxial-prolate and the K2 and K3 principal axes are somewhat elongated within the same plane, 
with subvertical K3 axes and subhorizontal K1 axes (Figure 6f). This site will be discussed further below.
4.  Discussion
Magnetic remanence as a function of temperature experiments indicate mixtures of magnetic minerals for 
the Itararé Group rocks. In the DC experiments, the separation of the FC-ZFC curves at low temperature, 
which join upon heating at ∼250 K or higher (Figures 3a and 3), is indicative of nanogoethite that possesses 
unblocking temperatures somewhat below the Néel temperature (TN) of fully crystalline goethite (∼393 K). 
The decreases in remanence ∼120 and 250 K in the FC-ZFC and/or RTISIRM cooling and warming curves 
correspond to the magnetite Verwey (TV) and hematite Morin (TM) transitions, respectively. The nonrecov-
ery of magnetization from the temperature cycling of the RTSIRM suggests that multidomain magnetite is 
responsible for the magnetization lost (Figures 3a and 3). Likewise, the curvature, or humpiness, of these 
curves is indicative of oxidized magnetite (Özdemir & Dunlop, 2010).

The remanence removed during the AF demagnetization in the goethite test-experiments reflects remov-
al of soft magnetic contributions, likely from magnetite or nanohematite (e.g., Roberts et al., 2020) (Fig-
ures 3b–3d). The remanence removed through heating of the specimens to 400 K in the same experiments 
is attributed to goethite but could in part be attributed to nanomaghemite, as suggested by the increase in 
remanence toward low temperature of the final temperature cycling after the 400 K demagnetization (Cart-
er-Stiglitz et al., 2001; Smirnov & Tarduno, 2000). Finally, the inflection of these curves ∼250 K (Figure 3b) 
and the prominent thermal hysteresis observed in Figure 3d are attributed to hematite cycling across the 
Morin transition.
Magnetic susceptibility experiments as a function of frequency and temperature indicate that the in-phase 
susceptibility χ′ largely reflects the paramagnetic contribution to the samples, with superimposed hematite 
and magnetite contributions below room temperature (Figures 3b, 3c, and 3). For the gray diamictite speci-
men at site II6, a narrow superparamagnetic (SP) blocking temperature peak is present at 20 K (Figure 3e). 
The out-of-phase susceptibility χ″ instead appears to be particularly sensitive to the hematite Morin tran-
sition at temperatures ranging between ∼200 and 250 K, with the position of the peak reflecting different

grain sizes (Figures 3a–3c, 3f, and 3). In fewer cases, χ″ reveals the magnetite Verwey transition (Figures 3e 
and 3f). As for the χ′ peak, the 20 K χ″ peak for the specimen at site II6 is interpreted as a SP blocking 
temperature (Figure 3e). In two other specimens, a white-pink sandstone and a red bed, χ″ does not reveal 
a distinctive peak associated with either the TM or the TV observed in the DC experiments but instead pos-
sesses a broader arch with maximum susceptibilities around 175 and 125 K (Figures 3d and 3h). For both 
these lithologies, the DC experiments indicate a hematite TM at ∼250 K. Additionally, temperature cycling 
of the RTSIRM curves for the sandstone reveals some nonrecovery of remanence when warming above 
100 K, while for the red bed specimen a magnetite TV at 120 K is also present. The arch is thus interpreted 
as a broad blocking temperature spectrum for grains in a SP state, likely magnetite.
Hysteresis data show that the majority of the Itararé Group rocks at room temperature are dominantly 
paramagnetic, with narrow hysteresis loops that for most sites resemble straight lines that pass through the 
origin with steep positive slope (Figure 4). After subtraction of the paramagnetic slope, the loops indicate 
low saturation magnetization (MS) and remanent magnetization (MR), consistently with low concentrations 
of ferromagnetic grains (s.l.). The hysteresis loops for a minority of sites have more curvature, indicating 
increased ferromagnetic (s.l.) content (e.g., the gray diamictite at II6), yet, the loops are narrow and have 
low MS and even lower MR after paramagnetic correction, indicating a mixture of SP and multidomain 
magnetite grains. A few loops are wider and constricted at the origin (e.g., the red bed at II13, the II20 rhyth-
mite, and the II10 diamictite), reflecting coercivity contrasts (e.g., Tauxe et al., 1996), consistently with the 
low-temperature evidence for presence of magnetite and hematite.
4.1.  Origin of the AMS
Provided the dominant paramagnetic behavior of the Itararé Group rocks at room temperature, most AMS 
fabrics are interpreted to reflect the attitude of the paramagnetic phases in the samples. For the lithologies 
with increased ferromagnetic (s.l.) mineral content, the AMS is instead likely carried by these grains, wheth-
er magnetite, hematite, or SP grains.
The orientation of the AMS fabrics, bedding parallel to somewhat imbricated (Figures 5 and 6), allows in-
terpreting the majority of the fabrics as primary sedimentary compactional fabrics and sedimentary fabrics 
deposited in a current, respectively (e.g., Bilardello, 2016; Jackson & Tauxe, 1991; Kodama, 2012; Tarling & 
Hrouda, 1993). In a paleomagnetic study conducted on the same Itararé Group rock specimens, Bilardello 
et al. (2018) had determined that these rocks had been affected by Cretaceous remagnetizations. The re-
sponsible heating or hydrothermal events, however, do not appear to have affected the attitude of the AMS 
fabrics recorded. Magmatic events responsible for remagnetizations have generally found not to affect AMS 
fabrics in natural and synthetic rocks, and in certain cases were even found to enhance remanent fabrics 
by secondary growth of magnetic minerals along the preexisting fabric (e.g., Borradaile & Lagroix, 2000; 
Henry et al., 2003; Li & Kodama, 2005). Where heating was found to negatively affect the AMS, it resulted 
in a weakening of the fabric and increased dispersion of the principal anisotropy axes (Li & Kodama, 2005), 
which is not observed in the Itararé Group rocks.
Exceptions for the interpretation of primary sedimentary fabrics are the slumped shale at site IT5, and the 
two strongly imbricated triaxial fabrics observed for the siltstone at site II5 and the diamictite at site II14. 
The attitudes of the magnetic fabrics before and after tilt correction for site IT5 (cf., Figures 6a and 6b) 
indicate better clustering of the AMS principal axes in geographic coordinates, similarly to the better group-
ing of paleomagnetic directions for the same site reported in Bilardello et al. (2018). The AMS fabric in 
geographic coordinates is thus interpreted to have been acquired after the slumping event and represents 
gravitational/compactional reorientation of the grains in a wet sediment. The fabric, therefore, represents 
a superposition of a compactional and deformation fabric, where the magnetic lineation, subparallel to the 
fold axes, constitutes an intersection lineation acquired during slumping (e.g., Bilardello, 2016; Bilardello 
& Kodama, 2009; Housen et al., 1993; Weil & Yonkee, 2009). Following this interpretation, the fabric of site 
IT5 is not used for any paleocurrent analysis. The AMS fabrics for sites II5 and II14 (Figures 6c and 6d) are 
more difficult to interpret: the ∼50° offset of the K3 axes from the pole to bedding is too large to be attributed 
to any sedimentary process as grains become unstable at these angles (Novak et al., 2014) and no deforma-
tion structures were observed. We exclude the fabrics from these sites from the paleocurrent analysis.

Representative site-mean fabrics on the map of the Itararé Group, plotted with their confidence ellipses 
around the mean principal axes, are reported in Figure 7. As discussed above, the fabrics for the different 
lithologies vary widely from oblate to triaxial and in degree of anisotropy, invalidating the calculation of 
average fabrics for sites that are proximal to each other. In general, the more oblate fabrics tend to be sub-
parallel to the bedding plane, with steep K3 axes and K1 and K2 axes dispersed in the horizontal plane, deter-
mining poorly defined magnetic lineations (e.g., sites II17 and II16). These fabrics represent sedimentary/
compactional fabrics resulting from deposition under low current conditions (e.g., Bilardello, 2016; Koda-
ma, 2012; Martín-Hernández et al., 2004; Taira, 1989; Tarling & Hrouda, 1993). However, oblate fabrics also 
possess increasing imbrication with respect to bedding, yet not necessarily parallel to the magnetic lineation 
(e.g., sites II9, II10, II11, II12, and IT13). The degree of imbrication tends to increase for increasingly triaxial 
fabrics, however, as for the more oblate fabrics, the imbrication can parallel the K2 principal axes (e.g., sites 
II8, II12, and II16), or neither the K1 or K2 axes, defining magnetic foliations that are somewhat oblique with 
respect to bedding (e.g., II4, II7, II18, and IT4). The orientation of the magnetic lineation within a grain is 
controlled by grain shape in minerals with shape anisotropy, like magnetite, or is parallel to the crystallo-
graphic a-axes for the paramagnetic susceptibility of most phyllosilicate grains (e.g., Biedermann, 2018; 
Borradaile & Werner, 1994). For minerals that possess magnetocrystalline anisotropy, like hematite, the 
lineation may lie anywhere within the platelets' basal plane (e.g., Biedermann, 2018; Guerrero-Suarez & 
Martín-Hernández, 2012; Hrouda, 2002; Martin-Hernandez and Guerrero-Suárez, 2012), or parallel the 
distribution of iron-bearing inclusions in phyllosilicate minerals (e.g., Biedermann, 2018; Borradaile & Wer-
ner, 1994; Lagroix & Borradaile, 2000; Martı́n-Hernández & Hirt, 2003; Parés & van der Pluijm, 2002). The 
orientation of the low-field magnetic susceptibility lineation is therefore not always a reliable indicator of 
particle alignment in a current and may in fact reflect the alignment of iron inclusions in phyllosilicate 
grains, and/or the intersection lineation of ferromagnetic (s.l.) or paramagnetic minerals. However, for site-
mean fabrics where the distribution of the K3 principal axes is elongated, the orientation of their elongation 
is often parallel to the direction of imbrication, reflecting variable angles of repose of the mineral platelets 
and reflecting paleocurrent orientation. The mean plunge of the minimum axis of the site-mean fabric is 
thus the most reliable indicator of paleocurrent direction, particularly when elongated, and not the linea-
tion, as is generally reported for ferrimagnetic grains with shape anisotropy (e.g., Jackson & Tauxe, 1991; 
Kodama, 2012; Martín-Hernández et al., 2004; Tarling & Hrouda, 1993).
To evaluate the geographic distribution of fabrics, averaging a small number of site-mean fabrics from dif-
ferent lithologies would not result in a representative fabric; however, it is legitimate to average many site-
mean fabrics to determine an overall mean for the region. Removing the fabrics of the discordant sites (IT5, 
II5, and II14), the mean AMS fabric for the Itararé Group rocks can be interpreted as primary depositional, 
with subvertical K3 axes and K1 and K2 axes distributed in the horizontal plane, with large and overlapping 
confidence ellipses around their means (Figures 5a, 5b, and 6). Focusing on the distribution of the K3 axes, 
these collectively define a prominent NW-SE elongation in the direction of the mean orientation of the K1 
axis (Figures 6 and 7), defining the dominant paleocurrent orientation.
Many site-mean fabrics are subparallel to bedding, and others have more pronounced imbrication but con-
fidence ellipses around the K3 axes that include the vertical (sites IT1, IT2, IT8, II1, II2, II16, and II20). To 
evaluate the overall imbrication orientation in greater detail, the K3 axis-orientation of these seven (7/33) 
sites was eliminated, and the remainder of site-mean minimum axes plotted on a rose diagram (Figure 7). A 
dominant distribution to the NW is apparent, with a narrower distribution to the WSW and a smaller distri-
bution to the SE and SSE also present. The distribution to the WSW, however, is made up by relatively small 
imbrication angles, which may be considered less significant for such analysis, and the more pronounced 
∼NW-SE trend defines the dominant paleocurrent orientation, with prevalent sediment transport direction 
to the NW.
4.2.  Depositional Environments
Taira (1989) conducted an AMS study of natural sedimentary rocks from modern fluvial, eolian dune, 
and beach environments as well as flume experiments using sediment deposited under different regimes, 
and supported by photometric quartz c-axis and microscopic grain counting measurements of thin sec-
tions. Four mechanisms of fabric orientation in sedimentary regimes were identified: “gravity” (including

deposition on a slope), “current”, “grain collision”, and “viscous suspension”. Based on two parameters, 
the q-value (L/F of the AMS fabrics and defined as (K1 − K2)/[0.5(K1 + K2) − K3] following Granar [1957]) 
and β, the imbrication angle of the fabrics relative to the bedding plane, Taira (1989) empirically drew 
regions on such diagram comprising the values of q and β that define the four mechanisms. For settling 
under prevalent gravity and absence of current or turbulence, the K3 axes align subvertically, while the K1 
and K2 axes are distributed within the bedding plane, generating oblate susceptibility ellipsoids (Tarling 
& Hrouda, 1993). The fabrics are strongly foliated (low q-value) and low imbricated (low β-value). As the 
slope of the substrate increases, the imbrication angle relative to bedding will increase, whereas q increases 
somewhat, but generally maintains low values (Taira, 1989). Current flow causes elongated grains with 
shape anisotropy to reorient with K1 axes rotating to parallel to the flow direction. Lift and drag forces flip 
downcurrent dipping grains so that they become imbricated in the upcurrent direction by tangential shear 
stresses (Taira, 1989). As the bottom shear stresses increase, the imbrication angle increases up to 10°–15°, 
and stronger lineations develop, whether parallel to the current or orthogonal intersection lineations, re-
sulting in increased q-values (Taira, 1989). Grain collision, most commonly results from the layer by layer 
collision of grains, typically on an inclined surface, and was theoretically investigated by Rees (1968). Sedi-
ment grains oriented by such collision typically align with the K1 axes parallel to the shear stress and imbri-
cation was shown both theoretically and experimentally to increase from ∼20° to 35° (Hamilton et al., 1968; 
Rees, 1968) and the q-value to be high (0.6–0.7) when compared with gravity fabrics (on horizontal or sloped 
surfaces) (Taira, 1989). Additionally, particles in non-Newtonian fluids may orient in a viscous fluid, such as 
magma flows and lava. Despite the limited experimental data available, Rees and Woodall (1975) observed 
q and β to be intermediate and between current deposition and grain collision on the q–β diagram, sug-
gesting that a combination of the two mechanisms acts on viscously suspended particles (Taira, 1989). The 
q–β diagram was successfully applied in a number of recent studies conducted in different environments 
ranging from gravelly fan delta systems to turbidite sequences (e.g., Park et al., 2013; Tamaki et al., 2015); 
however, Novak et al. (2014), who applied the method to accretionary prism sediments, further recognized 
that data often plotted outside the q–β fields defined by Taira (1989). They interpreted data that plot at q-val-
ues intermediate between deposition on slope and grain suspension (∼0.2 < q < ∼0.4) as a combination of 
these two processes. Most importantly, they introduced the field of “deformation/disturbance” for highest 
q-values (0.7 < q < 1.3) spanning the range of possible β values, and they introduced a “tilting” regime, for 
high imbrication angles (β > 40°) that exceed those resulting from natural sedimentary processes, and q-val-
ues < 0.7. They attribute data plotting in this field to undeformed tilted blocks, which preserve the primary 
magnetic fabrics, albeit with steeper imbrications (Novak et al., 2014).
The majority of data from this study plot within the “gravity” to “grain collision” areas (Figure 8). Despite 
the scatter of the individual specimen data, the distribution of the site-mean data is remarkably aligned 
within the fields outlined for the different depositional regimes, with just two site means (sandstone site 
IT11 and diamictite site II6) plotting just outside the “current” and “viscous suspension” areas, and between 
deposition on a slope and grain suspension, possibly representing somewhat higher sediment concentra-
tions in a flow or deposition on a slope. As would be expected, the scatter of the individual specimen data 
for each site increases as the site-mean data plot farther from the main distribution, as can be appreciated 
from visually inspecting the q–β diagram (Figure 8). Notably, the slumped sediments at site IT5 plot in the 
deformation/disturbance field of Novak et al. (2014), with data in geographic and stratigraphic specimen 
coordinates spanning a range of imbrication angles, as already shown in Figure 6. This evidence supports 
the interpretation of a composite fabric that was generated by the slumping of a wet sediment, with a 
prominent intersection lineation, and subsequent gravitational/compactional reorientation of grains that 
realigned the K3 axes to subvertical.
At a glance, the finer grained lithologies with ∼bedding parallel fabrics, the claystones and rhythmites, plot 
at the intersection of the “gravity” and “current” areas of the diagram, consistently with expectations. At 
the opposite end, the coarsest sandstones at sites II8 and IT8, and the turbidite at site IT4 plot in the “grain

collision” area, as expected for the highest-energy deposits. The pelodite at site IT6 also plots in this field: pe-
lodites are formed by redeposition of the finer grain size fraction of diamictites after being removed by water 
action (Harland et al., 1966; Woodworth, 1912). While massive, and void of sedimentary structures, the 
strong lineation at IT6 (q-value = 0.53), perpendicular to the elongation direction of the K3 axes (Figure 6f), 
is interpreted here as an intersection lineation of phyllosilicate mineral planes resting at varying angles 
around the mean imbrication and is consistent with a massive deposit resulting from reworking by strong 
currents. Most sandstones, siltstones, and the red bed sites plot at the intersection of the “current” and “vis-
cous suspension” areas of the plot, whereas the diamictites extend from the “current” area to the “viscous 
suspension/grain collision” areas. Additionally, the siltstone at site II5 and the diamictite at site II14, that 
were already interpreted as carrying secondary magnetic fabrics, plot in the “tilting” region of (2014). The 
beds collected were flat-lying and otherwise undisturbed, therefore, despite the dominant paramagnetic 
behavior for these sites at room temperature (cf., Figures 3 and 4), the fabrics and their imbrication are 
attributed to authigenic grains precipitated from hydrothermal fluids migrating during the remagnetization 
events described by Bilardello et al. (2018) and do not reflect primary sedimentary fabrics.
The Itararé Group rocks have been widely interpreted as fining upwards glacial–subglacial successions rep-
resenting sea-level rise during glacial melting (e.g., França & Potter, 1988, 1991; Limarino & Spalletti, 2006; 
Rocha-Campos et al., 2008; Santos et al., 1996). Distal facies, such as rhythmites and shales, result from sus-
pension or suspension plus traction. Mass transport may develop into gravitational flows, segregating sand 
out of the main flow, and depositing sandy debris and occasional turbidites (França & Vesely, 2007; Vesely

et al., 2018). More specifically, in a more proximal to distal setting relative to the source glaciers, the poorly 
to well-sorted sandstones, often aggradational and with rapid vertical facies changes, have been interpreted 
as subaqueous outwash-fan apron deposits, grading laterally into diamictites and mudstones (Carvalho & 
Vesely, 2017; França & Vesely, 2007; Mottin et al., 2018). The abundant massive and unsorted diamictites 
represent subaqueous mass transport deposits resulting from resedimentation of glacially derived debris 
and previously accumulated sediments and more distally can involve slumping (Arab et al., 2009; Mottin 
et al., 2018). Rhythmite and sandstone sequences represent deposition under hydrodynamic underflows 
associated with suspension fallout and sediment traction. Coarsening upward trends are attributed to pro-
gradation, ascribing some rhythmite units to tide-influenced delta front regions (Mottin et al., 2018). Delta 
front facies evolve into tide-influenced delta-plain deposits consisting of medium to coarse sandstones, of-
ten channelized and lenticular, with subordinate thin and massive mudstones and sandstones. Shale depos-
its represent the most distal environments characterized by sediment suspension (Carvalho & Vesely, 2017; 
França & Vesely, 2007; Mottin et al., 2018).
The depositional environments interpreted for the different facies of the Itararé Group rocks are generally 
consistent with the depositional regimes extrapolated from the q–β diagram, with claystones and rhyth-
mites deposited under the least influence of currents, and flow conditions increasing for most sandstone 
and siltstone deposits, and evolving into mass transport viscous suspension and grain collision regimes for 
most of the diamictites and the turbidite deposit. The sandstone deposits at II8 and IT8, a buff sand deposit-
ed as a thin (∼40 cm) layer and a medium sand deposit, respectively, fit the description of outwash deposits 
associated with the turbidites and diamictites. The agreement between the stratigraphic interpretations and 
the q–β diagram thus confirms the interpretation of primary AMS fabrics, with the exception of sites IT5, 
II5, and II14. This interpretation in turn validates the use of AMS to determine paleocurrent directions, 
indicating a dominant NW transport direction across the state of São Paulo.
4.3.  Independent Evidence for Transport Direction
Many studies have investigated the ice-transport direction of the Itararé Group rocks and were nicely sum-
marized by Gesicki et al. (2002) and da Rosa et al. (2016). These consist of direct evidence derived from 
landforms and striations arising from glacier movement, and specific to the state of São Paulo, eight such oc-
currences have been reported. Three studies (Almeida, 1948; Amaral, 1965; Viviani & Rocha-Campos, 2002) 
investigated streamlined landforms, roches moutonnées and whalebacks, with superimposed striations in-
dicating paleo-ice flow to the northwest. A streamlined elongated granitic body studied by Rocha-Campos 
et al. (1968) possessed SE-NW-oriented striated surfaces. A study by Caetano-Chang et al. (1990) describe 
soft-sediment grooved surfaces of subglacial origin on a diamictite deposit, where striations terminating in 
lodged pebbles indicate a paleo-ice-flow direction to the NW. Pérez-Aguilar et al. (2009) describe striated 
pavements on Precambrian granites oriented to the NW and displaying crescentic fractures and gouges that 
indicate a northwestward ice flow. The two surfaces described are covered by diamictites interpreted to be 
deposited by an active glacier moving over the bed. Other evidence comes from studies of striated clast 
pavements at two different localities by Rocha-Campos et al. (1968, 1969, 1976) and consisting of linear 
concentrations of clasts of different sizes within the same stratigraphic horizon, where the clasts are often 
flat and contain parallel striations with uniform orientations. At the first locality, the pavement is within 
diamictites, interpreted as subglacial tillites, displaying faceted clasts with striated upper surfaces. From 
these, a paleo-ice flow to the northwest was interpreted based on clast imbrication and on the presence of 
crescentic fractures in a granitic boulder contained within the pavement. At the second locality, two pave-
ments possessing faceted clasts with striated top surfaces were identified. Based on clast imbrication, the 
direction of paleo-ice flow was interpreted to be N-NW.
Paleocurrent directions have also been determined from sparse sedimentary structures within sandstone 
deposits from the same region (Arab et al., 2009), indicating WNW to NNW sediment transport directions. 
The paleocurrent and paleo-ice-flow directions obtained from these independent methods, thus appear to 
be related, and agree nicely with the AMS lineation data reported here for the entire state of São Paulo. Such 
correlations thus fully support the inferred regional paleocurrent direction to the NW, which is intrinsically 
tied to ice-kinematics. Following multiple lines of evidence, this study confirms the validity of the AMS

method to aid recognition of the depositional environments and the current directions for sediments of 
glacial affinity that are mostly void of sedimentary structures.
5.  Conclusions
We conducted an AMS study on specimens collected from 33 sedimentary rocks sites within the Itararé 
Group throughout the entire state of São Paulo, Brazil. The rocks were deposited during the LPIA and do 
not display macroscopic sedimentary structures or ice-kinematic indicators.
Low-temperature magnetic experiments (DC magnetic remanence and AC magnetic susceptibility) reveal a 
complex magnetic mineralogy for the different sites, consisting of assemblages of magnetite plus goethite, 
or magnetite and hematite plus goethite, with magnetite and hematite sometimes occurring as nanophases. 
However, room temperature magnetic hysteresis data and AC in-phase susceptibility between 10 K and 
room temperature indicate that at room temperature the dominant susceptibility response is paramagnetic.
The paramagnetic susceptibility response at room temperature implies that AMS is largely carried by the 
paramagnetic component and records primary depositional fabrics. The majority of site-mean AMS data 
are triaxial–oblate with bedding parallel to slightly imbricated ellipsoids. The site-mean magnetic lineations 
are subhorizontal, girdled NE-SW. The site-mean minimum axes are subvertical and distributed along a SE-
NW elongation direction, with prominent imbrication to the NW. Together, the orientation of the magnetic 
lineation and orientation of the site-mean AMS fabrics suggest deposition in a current with a dominant 
direction of transport to the NW.
Evaluation of the AMS data on a q–β diagram confirms that the Itararé Group sedimentary rocks were 
deposited under varying conditions ranging from gravitational settling to increasing current conditions, 
evolving into mass transport processes involving grain collision. These results agree with the depositional 
environments interpreted for the Itararé Group rocks around the Paraná Basin, lending support to our mag-
netic fabric interpretation. We emphasize the validity of the q–β diagram, which is rather underutilized in 
sedimentary fabric studies.
Ice-flow kinematics within the state of São Paulo, as determined from rare direct field evidence obtained at 
a limited number of localities, supports the SE-NW paleocurrent directions obtained here across the entire 
state, confirming our interpreted direction of sediment transport to the NW.
Our results confirm the validity of AMS as a rapid, nondestructive technique to investigate magnetic fabrics 
and assess depositional regimes in sedimentary rocks, allowing determination of paleocurrent directions 
where direct evidence is otherwise scarce.
