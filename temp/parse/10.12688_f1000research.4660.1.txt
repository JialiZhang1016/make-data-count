Abstract 
Learning and memory as well as long-term potentiation (LTP) depend 
on Ca2+ influx through the NMDA-type glutamate receptor (NMDAR) 
and the resulting activation of the Ca2+ and calmodulin-dependent 
protein kinase (CaMKII). Ca2+ influx via the NMDAR triggers CaMKII 
binding to the NMDAR for enhanced CaMKII accumulation at post-
synaptic sites that experience heightened activity as occurring during 
LTP. Previously, we generated knock-in (KI) mice in which we replaced 
two residues in the NMDAR GluN2B subunit to impair CaMKII binding 
to GluN2B. Various forms of LTP at the Schaffer collateral synapses in 
CA1 are reduced by 50%. Nevertheless, working memory in the win-
shift 8 arm maze and learning of the Morris water maze (MWM) task 
was normal in the KI mice although recall of the task was impaired in 
these mice during the period of early memory consolidation. We now 
show that massed training in the MWM task within a single day 
resulted in impaired learning. However, learning and recall of the 
Barnes maze task and contextual fear conditioning over one or 
multiple days were surprisingly unaffected. The differences observed 
in the MWM compared to the Barnes maze and contextual fear 
conditioning suggest a differential involvement of CaMKII and the 
specific interaction with GluN2B, probably depending on varying 
degrees of stress, cognitive demand or even potentially different 
plasticity mechanisms associated with the diverse tasks.

Introduction
The acquisition and storage of new tasks as well as the modification 
of already existing memories depend on the selective strengthen-
ing and weakening of synaptic interactions embedded in extensive 
networks of neurons (Kessels & Malinow, 2009; Martin et al., 
2000; Morris, 2013; Neves et al., 2008). Synaptic plasticity and 
especially long-term potentiation (LTP), a stable increase in syn-
aptic strength, are emerging as the cellular equivalent of learning 
and memory (Gruart et al., 2006; Whitlock et al., 2006). Two key 
players involved in LTP are the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent pro-
tein kinase II (CaMKII) and the NMDA-type glutamate receptor 
(NMDAR). Ca2+ influx through the NMDAR leads to CaMKII acti-
vation and recruitment to the postsynaptic density (PSD), which 
can be persistent and synapse specific (Otmakhov et al., 2004; 
Zhang et al., 2008) (but see also (Rose et al., 2009)). CaMKII bind-
ing to aa 1290–1309 on the NMDAR GluN2B subunit is required 
for this activity-dependent translocation (Halt et al., 2012; Leonard 
et al., 1999; Strack & Colbran, 1998; Strack et al., 2000) and is 
crucial for LTP (Barria & Malinow, 2005; Halt et al., 2012; Zhou 
et al., 2007). Stimulation of CaMKII results in its auto-phosphoryl-
ation on T286 causing a persistent Ca2+-independent activation of 
CaMKII (Lisman et al., 2002). This auto-phosphorylation is increased 
after LTP and spatial learning in the Morris water maze (MWM) 
(Lengyel et al., 2004; Ouyang et al., 1997; Ouyang et al., 1999; Tan 
& Liang, 1996) and is required for effective binding of CaMKII 
to GluN2B (Bayer et al., 2001; Strack & Colbran, 1998). T286A 
CaMKII mutant mice exhibit no hippocampal NMDAR dependent 
LTP and have impaired MWM learning (Giese et al., 1998).
We recently reported the specific disruption of CaMKII binding 
to GluN2B by point mutations in the GluN2B gene (Halt et al., 
2012). The GluN2BKI mice contain two point mutations in the 
GluN2B C terminus (L1298A and R1300Q). Each of these muta-
tions abolishes CaMKII binding to this site nearly completely 
in vitro (Strack et al., 2000). In vivo the two point mutations entirely 
abrogate the activity-dependent increase in the interaction with the 
NMDAR, show reduced hippocampal LTP by 50% and result in a 
MWM memory deficit, while acquisition of the MWM task and 
working memory as evaluated in the 8 arm win shift test remain 
normal (Halt et al., 2012).
Now we report a specific moderate spatial learning deficit in the 
GluN2B knock in (KI) mice during massed 1-day training in the 
MWM. At the same time learning and memory recall in the Barnes 
maze and contextual fear conditioning are unaffected.
Material and methods
Mice
All animal procedures were approved (Protocol #: 15512; PHS/NIH 
Assurance A3433-01) by the UC Davis Institutional Animal Care 
and Use Committee (IACUC) and followed NIH guidelines. All 
experiments were conducted with litter matched wild type (WT) 
and GluN2B KI mice of mixed sex (evenly distributed gender ratios) 
and between 2 and 4 months of age; mice within a cohort were not 
more than 3 weeks apart. For a more detailed characterization and 
description of the GluN2B KI mice (C57BL/6J background) includ-
ing genotyping procedures refer to (Halt et al., 2012). The mice 
were on a 12 h light/dark cycle, housed individually for the behav-
ioral experiments and acclimated for at least one week before all 
procedures. After the acclimation period and before the training and 
testing the mice were extensively handled (7–10 times for 1–2 min 
on different days). All trainings and testing were performed during 
the 12 h light cycle.
Morris water maze
The MWM was a circular, enamel coated steel tank, 94 cm in 
diameter filled with water at 22–24°C. For the visible trial, a black 
labeled square platform (6 × 6 cm) emerging 2 cm out of the opaque 
(through addition of non-toxic paint) water surface was used, while 
the clear Plexiglas square platform (6 × 6 cm) for the training tri-
als was submerged 2 cm below the opaque water surface. On the 
first day, the mice were trained in one visible trial followed by 12 
consecutive training trials, while the platform was kept in a fixed 
position. The mice were always placed facing the wall of the pool 
and started randomly from three different starting positions that are 
equally distributed around the perimeter and are not located within 
the target quadrant. The mice were allowed to swim freely for 90 s 
to find the platform. If they failed to locate the platform within time, 
they were gently guided to it. After the mice climbed on the plat-
form they were allowed to remain 30 s on the platform before they 
were removed from the pool and placed in their home cage for an 
inter-trial interval of 6–10 min. The mice were returned to the pool 
for a 90 s probe test without the platform 1 day and 7 days after the 
training day. The training session and probe trials were monitored 
and analyzed using the SMART (Version 2.5.19) real-time video-
tracking system.
Barnes maze
The Barnes maze was executed according to (Berta et al., 2007). 
In short, the maze consisted of a circular platform (92 cm diameter; 
opaque white) with 20 equally spaced holes (5 cm diameter; 7.5 cm 
between holes) and was elevated 105 cm above the floor. All holes 
were 2 cm away from the perimeter of the platform and a dark 
escape box (10 cm × 12.5 cm × 12.5 cm) was located beneath one 
of the holes.
The mouse was placed in a cylindrical black start chamber (10 cm × 
12.5 cm × 12.5 cm) in the middle of the maze. After 10 s the chamber 
was lifted and the mouse was exposed to bright light (500 W). For 
the habituation trial on day 1 the animal was gently guided to the 
escape box and once it entered, the entry hole was covered and the 
mouse kept for 2 min in the dark escape box. Between each mouse, 
before the next trial, the platform was cleaned with a 10% Nolvasan 
solution to avoid remaining olfactory cues. During the acquisition 
phase, after the start chamber was lifted, the mouse was allowed to 
explore the maze for 3 min. The trial ended when the mouse entered 
the escape box or after 3 min had elapsed. Immediately after the 
mouse entered the escape box, the entry hole was covered and the 
animal stayed for 1 min in the dark escape box. If the mouse did not 
reach the target hole/escape box within 3 min, it was gently guided 
to it. After 1 min in the escape box, the mouse was placed back in its 
home cage until the next trial. Each mouse received 4 training trials 
per day with an inter-trial interval of 10–15 min on 4 consecutive 
days.
The probe trial was conducted on day 5, i.e., 24 h after the last train-
ing day, and on day 12. During the probe test the escape box was 
removed and the mouse was allowed to explore the maze for a fixed

time of 90 s. The number of pokes (errors) in each hole and the 
latency and path length to reach the virtual target hole was meas-
ured using the SMART (Version 2.5.19) real-time video-tracking 
system.
Elevated plus maze
The elevated plus maze (EPM) was a four arm maze with each arm 
measuring 30 × 5 cm and the central platform measured 5 × 5 cm 
(opaque white). One set of arms, opposing one another, were 
enclosed completely by grey side walls, 15 cm high, while the other 
set was open with a ledge of 0.5 cm on either side of the arms. The 
maze was elevated 100 cm from the floor and illuminated evenly 
with a 500W light. Mice were placed on the central platform, fac-
ing towards a closed arm, and allowed to freely explore the maze 
for 5 min. The SMART (Version 2.5.19) real-time tracking software 
was used to record the locomotor activity and the time spent on both 
the closed and the open arms during the test.
Fear conditioning
Contextual fear conditioning was conducted using the ‘Video 
Tracking of Fear Conditioning System’ and the ‘Video Freeze Soft-
ware’ from MED Associates Inc. The experimentally naïve mice 
were placed in the conditioning chamber and received the first foot 
shock at the end of a 3 min habituation period. The mice remained 
for an additional minute in the chamber after the last foot shock was 
delivered. For the 5 shock conditioning protocol, the mice received 
an electric foot shock (0.75 mA, 1 s) at the end of the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 
and 7th minute. During the milder 3 shock (0.5 mA, 1 s) paradigm, 
the shock was received at the end of the 3rd, 4th and 5th minute. For 
the 4 day training protocol only one shock (0.75 mA, 1 s) per day 
was delivered after 2.5 min. In case of the milder 3 shock paradigm 
and the 4 day training protocol the mice were pre-exposed to the 
conditioning chamber for 3 min and 10 min respectively. For recall 
the mice were placed back for 5 min in the same chamber after the 
indicated periods of time. If the mice were exposed to a different 
context, the chamber geometry was changed (from square to curved 
wall), the lights were dimmed, the rod-flooring was covered with 
white linoleum, and the scent was changed from 0.01% bleach to 
bubble gum. Using the Video Freeze Program, the freezing time 
was determined (in %) and was defined as the absence of any 
movement, except for respiratory motion. The observed freezing 
response to the foot shock is correlated to the degree of learning, the 
strength of the aversive stimulus, and the number of presentations 
(Curzon et al., 2009).
Statistical analysis
All data are represented as mean ± the standard error of the mean 
(SEM). The data were analyzed by unpaired two-tailed t-test, one-
way ANOVA or two-way ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni cor-
rection as indicated in the results, using GraphPad Prism 5 software. 
Statistical significance was considered if p ≤ 0.05.
Results
Single day spatial learning in the MWM is impaired in 
GluN2B KI
In order to further dissect the memory deficit observed during the ini-
tial MWM experiments (Halt et al., 2012), two independent cohorts 
of GluN2B KI mice and their WT littermate controls (10 mice of 
each genotype per cohort) underwent a massed training protocol 
on a single day in the MWM. Such a compressed training protocol 
challenges the learning capacity within a short time period. It also 
has the potential to reveal deficits in early- versus late-phase con-
solidation as training is not protracted over 6 days as is the case for 
the classic MWM. The 1 day protocol thus might expose deficits in 
early consolidation when testing different cohorts 1 and 7 days after 
the training day without the complication that in the 6 days training 
paradigm training and consolidation processes overlap. After habitu-
ation on the first day (training day), mice underwent one visible plat-
form trial followed by 12 consecutive training trials, in which the 
platform was no longer visible but kept in a fixed position. The ini-
tial trial with a marked visible platform is hippocampus-independent 
and was conducted to rule out changes in motivation, coordination, 
or sensory processing in GluN2B KI mice. The latency in reach-
ing the visible platform was not different between the two geno-
types (Figure 1A; WT: 51.48 ± 7.43 s, KI: 46.46 ± 6.70 s). In the 
following 12 consecutive trials with a submerged platform the KI 
mice slowly started to show deficits in spatial learning around trial 
6, roughly the onset of learning in the WT mice (Figure 1B). The 
latencies of the 12 training trials are paired into blocks of two for 
analysis and the GluN2B KI mice display significantly increased 
average escape latencies during the last two trials (genotype: 
F1,228=2.63, p=0.1061; trial: F5,228=13.30, p<0.0001; genotype 
× trial F5,228=3.08, p=0.0103; Bonferroni post hoc test shows that 
the latency is significantly increased in the KI mice during the last 
two trials, Mdiff=20.30 s, 95% Cl [2.58, 38.01], p<0.05; Figure 1B; 
WT11–12: 30.31 ± 3.77 s, KI11–12: 50.61 ± 4.49 s).
The covered distance shows like the escape latency a significant 
genotype x trial interaction (Figure 1C; genotype: F1,228=0.16, 
p=0.687; trial: F5,228=43.34, p<0.0001; genotype × trial F5,228=3.13, 
p=0.0095), strengthening the mild learning deficit observed dur-
ing the last training trials. No difference was observed between the 
mean velocity of the WT and GluN2B KI mice (Figure 1D).
During the probe test one day after training, WT mice required sig-
nificantly less time to reach the original location of the platform as 
reflected by faster primary escape latency (Figure 1E; WT: 38.09 
± 6.15 s, KI: 55.32 ± 6.91 s; t(38)=2.15, p<0.05). Analysis of the 
entries into the quadrants and the area of the former platform loca-
tion also showed a significant difference between the two geno-
types in their preference for the target quadrant (Figure 1F). The 
KI mice showed compared to WT no real preference for the target 
quadrant D and entered it significantly less often (Figure 1F; WTD: 
9.45 ± 0.98, KID: 6.70 ± 1.22; genotype: F1,190=3.89, p≤0.05; 
quadrant/platform: F4,190=18.99, p<0.0001; genotype × quadrant/
platform F4,190=1.46, p=0.2147; Bonferroni post hoc test shows 
that the WT mice search preferentially in the target quadrant com-
pared to the KI mice, Mdiff=-2.750 entries, 95% Cl [-5.347, -0.153], 
p<0.05). The covered distance and mean velocity was not different 
between the two genotypes (Figure 1G), indicating similar activity 
levels.
During the probe test 7 days after training some of the mice (inde-
pendent of their genotype) were continuously floating and did not 
search actively for the escape platform. For the analysis of the 7 day 
probe trial, these floaters were neglected. The performance in the

Figure 1. Spatial learning in the Morris water maze (MWM) is impaired in GluN2B KI mice. (A) WT and KI mice display no difference in the 
average escape latency during the visible platform trial. (B) The GluN2B KI mice show a deficit during acquisition of the hidden platform task. 
The latencies of the 12 training trials are split up into blocks of two and the average escape latency is significantly increased for KI versus WT 
mice during the last two training trials. (C, D) The covered distance over the blocks of two training trials is also different between KI and WT 
mice (C), while the mean velocity is not changed (D). (E, F) During the probe test 1 day after training the KI mice exhibit increased primary 
average escape latency (E) and show significantly fewer crossings into the target quadrant D (F), the former location of the submerged platform, 
compared to WT mice. (G) Both genotypes cover the same distance during the probe trial and display the same mean velocity. (H, I) The KI mice 
show a similar tendency during the probe test 7 days after training, with extended primary average escape latency (H) and diminished crossings 
into target quadrant D (I). (J) The covered distance and mean velocity is again unchanged. (A: adjacent right quadrant to D; B: quadrant 
opposite to quadrant D; C: adjacent left quadrant to D; platform: area of the former location of the platform). The same two independent cohorts, 
each consisting of 10 WT and 10 GluN2B KI mice, were tested in the Barnes maze before the MWM. Data represent Mean ± SEM.

probe test 7 days after training showed a similar tendency com-
pared to the one day test. The GluN2B KI leaned towards a longer 
primary escape latency (Figure 1H, left; WT: 29.50 ± 8.59 s, KI: 
48.50 ± 5.98 s; t(18)=1.87, p=0.078) and tended to cross less often 
over into the target quadrant in search for the platform than WT 
mice (Figure 1I; WTD: 9.67 ± 1.49, KID: 6.46 ± 0.73; genotype: 
F1,90=3.12, p=0.0805; quadrant/platform: F4,90=16.69, p<0.0001; 
genotype × quadrant/platform F4,90=1.85, p=0.1259). Both geno-
types again showed no observable difference in the covered dis-
tance and mean velocity (Figure 1J).
Individual analysis (one-way-ANOVA) of the search pattern (quad-
rant crossings) reveals that the WT mice preferentially search in the 
target quadrant during the 1 day (F3,76=11.61, p<0.0001) as well 
as the 7 day probe trial (F3,32=3.91, p=0.0175). The GluN2B KI 
mice conversely only show a slight non-significant preference for 
the target quadrant during the 1 day probe trial and no preference at 
all during the 7 day probe trial.
Spatial learning and memory is not affected in the Barnes 
maze
The Barnes maze is a less aversive spatial learning paradigm, 
which unlike the MWM allows the mice to move freely and 
explore the environment under conditions that are less stressful. 
It is solely based on the motivation of the mice to avoid prolonged 
exposure to an open area under light and to search for a dark 
and safe hideout, the escape box. Interestingly, the GluN2B KI 
showed no detectable deficits not only in learning but also in early 
memory (Figure 2). These findings contrast what had been seen 
before after spaced MWM learning experiments conducted over 
a period of 6 days (Halt et al., 2012). Over the 16 training tri-
als, which were executed on 4 consecutive days (4 trials per day) 
the latency to locate and enter the escape box decreased equally 
fast for both genotypes and saturated on the fourth day (Figure 2A; 
WT: 22.99 ± 4.08 s, KI: 20.95 ± 3.95 s). During the probe test 
1 day after the last training session there was no difference in 
the primary escape latency (Figure 2B, left; WT: 20.11 ± 6.02 s, 
GluN2BKI: 18.68 ± 4.72 s), covered distance (Figure 2B, middle; 
WT: 355.70 ± 37.25 cm, GluN2BKI: 426.60 ± 43.64 cm) or mean 
velocity (Figure 2B, right; WT: 3.95 ± 0.41 cm/s, GluN2BKI: 4.74 
± 0.48 cm/s). Both WT and KI mice searched preferentially in the 
target area and the surrounding holes (areas +1 and -1), indicat-
ing that they clearly remembered the former location of the escape 
box (Figure 2B, lower part). The overall number of zone entries 
and time in zones for GluN2B KI mice showed a slight increase 
compared to WT mice, which is probably a reflection of the sta-
tistically non-significant increased activity of KI as seen in the 
covered distance and mean velocity (Figure 2B). The performance 
in the probe test 7 days after the last training session mirrored the 
results of the 1 day probe test. There was no significant difference 
in the primary escape latency (Figure 2C, left; WT: 33.37 ± 7.98 s, 
KI: 26.80 ± 6.61 s), covered distance (Figure 2C, middle; WT: 
265.40 ± 26.47 cm, GluN2BKI: 353.00 ± 49.42 cm) and mean 
velocity (Figure 2C, right; WT: 2.95 ± 0.29 cm/s, GluN2BKI: 3.92 
± 0.55 cm/s). The slightly increased activity of the GluN2B KI mice 
is again reflected by an increased number of zone entries and by 
the time spent in the zones (Figure 2C, bottom).
Basal anxiety levels in the GluN2B KI mice are normal
Basal anxiety levels in the GluN2B KI mice were assessed using 
the EPM. The EPM relies on the rodents’ innate fear of heights 
and open spaces and their preference for dark and enclosed rooms. 
Basal anxiety levels in the GluN2B KI mice were not different 
compared to their WT litter-matched controls. During exposure to 
the EPM the GluN2B KI mice spent most of the time in the closed 
arms, like the WT controls, and rarely stayed in the open arms 
or center (Figure 3A; in % of total time, WT: 92.30 ± 1.16%, KI: 
88.68 ± 3.27%). Both genotypes covered comparable minimal dis-
tances in the open arms (Figure 3B; WT: 20.63 ± 3.96 cm, GluN2B 
KI: 31.62 ± 10.73 cm), while the WT mice had the tendency to be 
more active in the closed arms. This tendency is displayed in an 
increase in covered distance (Figure 3B; WT: 881.59 ± 86.40 cm, 
KI: 626.92 ± 59.24 cm; genotype: F1,68=10.17, p=0.0022; loca-
tion: F3,68=120.21, p<0.0001; genotype × location F3,68=3.40, 
p=0.0225; Bonferroni post hoc test shows that the distance is sig-
nificantly reduced in the KI in the closed arms, Mdiff=-254.7 cm, 
95% Cl [-459.5, -49.49], p<0.01) and a trend towards a higher 
mean velocity in the closed arms (Figure 3C; WT: 3.19 ± 0.31 cm/s, 
GluN2B KI: 2.37 ± 0.21 cm/s), also apparent in the overall mean 
velocity (Figure 3C; WT: 3.34 ± 0.29 cm/s, GluN2B KI: 2.66 ± 0.18 
cm/s). The observed normal basal anxiety levels concur with earlier 
findings in the open field analysis and the same innate fear reaction 
to trimethyl-thiazoline (TMT) (Halt et al., 2012).
Learning and memory in contextual fear conditioning is not 
affected in GluN2B KI mice
With basal anxiety levels not being affected in the GluN2B KI 
mice (Halt et al., 2012) (Figure 3), we investigated the role of the 
CaMKII/GluN2B interaction in contextual fear conditioning. The 
experimentally naïve mice were placed in the conditioning cham-
ber and after a 3 min habituation period trained with five consecu-
tive foot shocks (0.75 mA, 1 s duration; aversive unconditioned 
stimulus). The GluN2B KI mice learned to the same extent and at 
the same speed as their WT litter-matched controls (Figure 4A, C). 
A total of four independent cohorts were trained. To be able to 
distinguish possible differences between memory recall and con-
solidation, two cohorts were tested after 4 days (Figure 4B) and 
the other two cohorts after 14 days (Figure 4D). For the probe tests 
(after 4 or 14 days) the mice were placed back for 5 min into the 
conditioning chamber and the freezing response to the context was 
measured. There was no difference in the average time WT and 
KI mice spent freezing during either the 4 (WT: 51.11 ± 3.37%, 
KI: 52.23 ± 3.77%) or 14 days (WT: 70.48 ± 4.75%, KI: 67.51 ± 
3.33%) probe test.
Contextual fear conditioning performance is independent of 
the stimulus strength
CaMKII T286A mutant mice have impaired contextual short-term 
memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM) formation after a 
single or three tone-shock pairings, while contextual STM and LTM 
formation after five pairings are unaffected (Irvine et al., 2011; 
Irvine et al., 2005). To exclude the possibility that the GluN2B KI 
mice were over trained with five consecutive foot shocks (0.75 mA, 
1 s duration) and potential cognitive deficits masked, we also tested 
two milder contextual fear conditioning paradigms.

Figure 2. Spatial learning and memory is unaffected in the Barnes maze. (A) The escape latency for both genotypes decreases equally 
over the 16 training trials and saturates on the fourth day (left panel depicts average latencies over each of the 4 training days whereas right 
panel shows averages for each individual trial). (B) The primary escape latency during the probe test 1 day after the last training session is 
not different. KI mice search like the WT mice preferentially in and around the target area for the escape box (bottom panels). The covered 
distance (middle) and mean velocity (right) is slightly, but not significantly increased in KI mice. (C) The probe test 7 days after the last training 
session shows, like the 1 day test, no difference in the avg. primary escape latency (left) and the KI mice again exhibited the tendency to 
increased covered distance (middle) and mean velocity (right). Both genotypes searched in the right location in and around the target area 
(bottom panels). The same two independent cohorts, each consisting of 10 WT and 10 GluN2B KI mice, were tested in the Barnes maze 
followed by the MWM. Data are presented as Mean ± SEM.

Figure 3. Basal anxiety levels in the GluN2B KI mice are normal. (A) The % of time the mice spent in the open and closed arms as well 
as the center is not different between WT and KI. (B) Both genotypes cover the same minimal distances in the open arms but WT mice cover 
greater distances than KI mice in the closed arms. (C) The overall mean velocity is not different between both genotypes, while the WT mice 
show a slightly increased mean velocity in the closed arm coinciding with the longer covered distance. One cohort of 10 WT and 9 GluN2B 
KI mice was tested. The same cohort was subsequently used for the milder three shock fear conditioning paradigm (Figure 5A–E). Data 
represent Mean ± SEM.
Figure 4. Contextual fear conditioning and memory is unaffected in GluN2B KI mice. Fear conditioning was evaluated 4 days after 
training of two different cohorts of naïve litter-matched WT, heterozygous, and GluN2B KI mice (12–14 WT and KI mice, and 3–4 heterozygous 
mice per cohort) and 14 days after training with yet another two different cohorts of naïve litter-matched WT, heterozygous, and GluN2B KI 
mice (10 WT mice, 10–12 KI mice, and 5–7 heterozygous mice per cohort). (A, C) After the 3 min habituation phase, 5 shocks (0.75 mA, 1 s) 
were delivered at the end of 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th minute (asterisks). The increase in the fraction of time spent freezing during conditioning 
is not different between the GluN2B KI, heterozygous, and WT mice. (B, D) All genotypes also display a comparable fraction of time freezing 
during the 4 day and the 14 day probe test. Data represent percentage freezing (Mean ± SEM).

During the first paradigm, after two days of 3 min pre exposure to 
the conditioning chamber, 3 shocks (0.5 mA, 1 s) were delivered 
on day 3 at the end of the 3rd, 4th and 5th minute. Conditioning and 
memory tested after 4 days (WT: 53.82 ± 3.55%, KI: 53.55 ± 6.10%) 
were unaffected (Figure 5A, B). When the mice were exposed to a 
different context in the same chamber and room 1 day later, the time 
spent freezing was reduced, similar to pre-conditioning levels, and 
did not differ between the two genotypes (Figure 5C; WT: 13.33 ± 
3.20%, KI: 18.90 ± 2.55%). Long term memory was tested with the 
same cohort 11 days after training (Figure 5D) and like the 4 day 
test showed no difference (WT: 47.63 ± 4.60%, KI: 53.08 ± 6.60%). 
Figure 5E depicts an overview of the experiment.
In addition, another cohort of GluN2B KI and WT mice were trained 
over multiple days. The mice were pre exposed to the context on 
day 1 for 10 min and trained on the following 4 days with one foot 
shock (each 0.75 mA, 1 s) per day (Figure 5F). Again no learning or 
memory deficit, which was tested 6 (WT: 75.52 ± 4.64%, GluN2B 
KI: 62.69 ± 6.21) and 8 days (WT: 64.75 ± 5.68%, KI: 59.06 ± 
7.56%) after training, was observed. When the mice were exposed 
to a different context in the same chamber and room on day 12, 
7 days after the last training, both genotypes exhibited reduced 
freezing levels (WT: 25.56 ± 5.85%, KI: 22.09 ± 6.93%) similar 
to those observed before conditioning.

Discussion
CaMKII and the NMDAR are crucial not only for hippocampal LTP 
but also for hippocampus dependent spatial learning and memory 
formation. In a number of studies CaMKIIα KO and mutant mice 
Figure 5. Contextual fear conditioning with milder conditioning is unaffected in GluN2B KI mice. One cohort of litter-matched GluN2B KI 
and WT mice (9–10 mice per genotype, previously tested in the EPM) was fear conditioned with three shocks on a single day and a different 
cohort of naïve litter-matched GluN2B KI and WT mice (10 mice per genotype) was fear conditioned with four shocks over a period of 4 days. 
(A) KI and WT mice acquired to the same extent fear conditioning as indicated by the time spent freezing after three consecutive mild foot 
shocks (0.5 mA, 1 s) at the end of the 3rd, 4th and 5th minute (asterisks). (B, D) The time spent freezing during recall of context after 4 d and 
11 d is not different between genotypes. (C) Exposure to a different context 5 days after training shows pre-conditioning freezing levels for 
both genotypes. (E) Summary plot of the experimental data from A-D. (F) Summary plot of the experimental data of the 4 day training (1 shock, 
0.75 mA, 1 s per day) experiment. WT and KI mice show comparable learning curves during the 4 d conditioning and similar contextual memory 
when tested 6 and 8 days later. Exposure to a different context in the same room and chamber, 7 d after the last training day, revealed again 
pre-conditioning freezing levels. Data represent percentage freezing (Mean ± SEM).

displayed learning deficits, notably mainly in aversively moti-
vated tasks (Elgersma et al., 2002; Giese et al., 1998; Irvine et al., 
2005; Silva et al., 1992), while appetitive learning was unaffected 
(Carvalho et al., 2001). Moreover, the regulation of expression or 
activity level of CaMKIIα seems to have an emotional compo-
nent and especially impact emotional and anxiety-like behavior 
and learning. CaMKIIα heterozygous KO mice show a decreased 
freezing in fear conditioning induced by an electric foot shock and 
are more active in the open field suggesting decreased anxiety-
related behaviors (Chen et al., 1994). Consistently, transgenic 
mice overexpressing CaMKIIα exhibit an increase in anxiety-like 
behaviors in open field, light-dark transition, and elevated zero 
maze (Hasegawa et al., 2009). CaMKIIα T286A mutant mice, 
which are deficient in autonomous and thereby overall CaMKII 
activity, spend more time in and entered more often the open 
arm in the EPM and generally react with hyperactivity to novel 
stimuli that could be perceived as potentially threatening (Easton 
et al., 2011). However, the behavior in the non-threatening neutral 
environment of the home cage is normal (Easton et al., 2011), in 
accordance with an impaired learning in MWM and fear condi-
tioning (Giese et al., 1998; Irvine et al., 2005) but a normal appe-
titive instrumental conditioning (Carvalho et al., 2001). Results 
in our study concur with these findings and argue for the specific 
importance of CaMKII binding to GluN2B in aversive and more 
demanding spatial learning task of the MWM, with the less threat-
ening and stressful Barnes maze task being unaffected in the KI 
mice. Contextual fear conditioning and memory was surprisingly 
not affected in the GluN2B KI mice. We assume that this discrep-
ancy is due to the higher demands of the MWM task and the differ-
ential regulation of spatial and contextual LTM formation (Mizuno 
& Giese, 2005).
Learning during massed training sessions, i.e., when training trials 
are given in short order on a single day, generally results in lower 
levels of learning than spaced training over a period of several days. 
For instance, in the MWM rats showed faster and better acquisition 
during spaced (16 trials over 4 days) than massed training (16 trials 
in 1 day) as well as better memory formation (Commins et al., 2003). 
During contextual fear conditioning 1 h spaced training also results 
in better memory formation than massed training, while cued fear 
conditioning is unaffected (Scharf et al., 2002). Likely because of 
the more demanding task of massed training, which requires infor-
mation being stored during a shorter time period than in spaced 
training, the GluN2B KI mice revealed a mild learning deficit com-
pared to WT mice in the 1 day paradigm (Figure 1) when they did 
not in the 6 day MWM training protocol (Halt et al., 2012). Figure 1D 
shows that there is no difference in the swim speed between WT 
and KI mice, which together with the increased covered distance of 
the KI mice during the last two trials (Figure 1C) argues against the 
differences in agility and fatigue in the GluN2B KI. The increased 
covered distance shows that the KI mice have to swim longer and 
cover a greater distance in order to find the platform during the 
later trials, further supporting the extended primary escape latency 
(Figure 1B) and therefore the KI learning deficit. The learning deficit in 
the 1 day paradigm suggests that the learning capacity over a more 
limited time period is reduced in GluN2B KI mice. In addition, the 
elevated stress level during the massed training in the 1 day proto-
col could affect learning in the GluN2B KI mice more than in WT 
contributing to the differential outcome.
The GluN2B KI phenotype is similar to alpha and delta CREB 
KO mice, which are impaired in massed but not in spaced MWM 
learning and contextual fear conditioning (Kogan et al., 1997). 
The improvement in memory after spaced learning is also mim-
icked in acute hippocampal slices where successive spaced theta 
burst stimulation resulted in enhanced previously saturated LTP 
(Kramar et al., 2012). In the study by Kramar et al. the induc-
tion of LTP in a subset of synapses during the first theta burst 
train primed the initially unresponsive neighbors (probably in a 
translation-dependent manner, since the two stimulations have to 
be spaced 1 h apart; see also (Scharf et al., 2002)), resulting in 
potentiation after stimulation with the second theta burst train. 
This mechanism will probably be especially important in cases 
of impaired LTP induction or expression like in our GluN2B 
KI mice where various forms of LTP were reduced by ~50% 
(Halt et al., 2012).
The Barnes maze is a demanding spatial task using visual cues 
in the room for navigation, which is in that regard similar to the 
MWM. One major difference between these two spatial learning 
paradigms is probably the amount of stress to which animals are 
exposed. The unaffected performance of the GluN2B KI mice in 
the less stressful Barnes Maze is in line with the known importance 
of CaMKII selectively in aversive rather than appetitive motivated 
spatial and contextual learning paradigms (Elgersma et al., 2002; 
Giese et al., 1998; Irvine et al., 2005; Silva et al., 1992). How-
ever, further potential differences include sensory processes and 
response requirements, which cannot be excluded as a reason for 
the deficit in massed MWM learning compared to no deficit in the 
Barnes maze (Figure 2).
Fear conditioning, on the other hand, creates a high level of anxi-
ety. Compared to spatial learning paradigms like the MWM, the 
contextual conditioning only requires memorization of a far less 
complex environment, which only has to be recognized and does 
not require navigation and localization of a certain target. Addi-
tionally, at the beginning of the conditioning the mice have time 
to explore and form a spatial map without being stressed or more 
anxious than during the normal exposure to a novel environment, 
before the first shock is delivered at the end of the 3rd minute. Dur-
ing the milder conditioning paradigm (Figure 5) the mice were 
pre-exposed to the shocking chamber on the previous day, which 
allowed the formation of an even better spatial representation 
(Fanselow, 2000; Frankland et al., 2004; Hu et al., 2007). This 
lack of a demanding spatial learning requirement and possible for-
mation of contextual memory during still low stress levels could 
explain the normal conditioning and contextual memory (Figure 4 
and Figure 5) compared to the moderate learning deficit observed 
during massed MWM training (Figure 1). In addition, fear con-
ditioning in general constitutes a very strong learning paradigm, 
which might override and mask any mild learning deficits because 
of its vigor even in the mildest form tested here. In support of this 
idea the five tone-shock pairings allow full fear conditioning in 
CaMKII T286A mutant mice when one and three pairings do not 
(Irvine et al., 2011; Irvine et al., 2005). Accordingly, the strength of 
conditioning can mask learning deficits, and for GluN2B KI mice 
that might even be the case for single shock experiments. Spatial 
and contextual LTM formation is differently regulated. There are 
not only divergent regional requirements within the hippocampus,

but also the control of gene transcription varies between spatial and 
contextual LTM formation (Mizuno & Giese, 2005). Accordingly, 
MWM and fear conditioning could depend on molecular mecha-
nisms that vary in detail even though both learning paradigms 
require CaMKII.
Contrasting CaMKIIα heterozygous KO, T286A KI mice, or trans-
genic mice overexpressing CaMKIIα, the GluN2B KI mice display 
no change in basal anxiety levels or anxiety-like behaviors. They 
show avoidance of the open arms in the EPM (Figure 3), behav-
ior in the open field (Halt et al., 2012), and reaction to TMT (the 
anxiogenic compound in fox urine) (Halt et al., 2012), a measure 
of innate fear, that are comparable to WT mice. Thus it appears 
that CaMKIIα affects fear behavior independent of its binding to 
GluN2B.
Our study suggests a specific requirement for the activity-dependent 
interaction of CaMKII with the NMDAR during the acquisition 
of more elaborate spatial learning tasks under modestly aversive, 
stressful conditions. The results argue not only for a role of CaMKII 
binding to GluN2B during consolidation (Halt et al., 2012), but 
also for learning, which becomes obvious under the here applied 
more demanding MWM conditions. The less stressful Barnes maze 
neither results in a consolidation deficit nor is the learning itself 
affected. In addition, the less demanding but more potent contextual 
fear conditioning and memory was surprisingly normal. Whether 
reduced recall of the MWM task 1 and 7 days after single day train-
ing reflects reduced learning, reduced memory consolidation, or 
both cannot be answered at this point.

The manuscript by Stein et al. expands previous work from the same group characterizing the 
learning abilities of CamKII knock-in mice (Halt et al., 2012). The mice carry two point mutations 
that impair the binding of CamKII to the NMDA receptor subunit GluN2B, and were shown to 
exhibit deficits in memory recall in the Morris Water maze (MWM).  Here, the authors present an 
extended and carefully performed behavioral analysis. Their new results show that spatial 
learning in the MWM is impaired when 12 training trials are compressed in a single day. In 
contrast, the previous study showed that spatial learning was normal when training was 
conducted over 6 consecutive days (2 trials per day). The different outcome is attributed to the 
increased cognitive demands and higher stress levels posed by massed training. The paper is well-
written and clearly presented, and the Methods are described with enough detail.  
  
Comments: 
 
The deficits in massed spatial learning are only detectable in the last two trials.  Do the 
authors have an explanation? Could the delay be related to a defect in an early phase of 
consolidation, in line with the hypothesis previously proposed by the authors (Halt et al., 
2012)?  
 
1. 
It might be nice to see whether memory consolidation is impaired in other hippocampal-
dependent tests not involving stress. For instance, the novel object recognition test that can 
be performed in a brief period of time and would additionally permits the assessment of 
memory recall at shorter time intervals after initial learning.

Summary: This study substantially extends the previous behavioral analysis of a mouse line with 
mutant GluN2B that is incapable of CaMKII binding. Individually, both GluN2B and CaMKII are 
critically involved in regulating synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. Previous studies from 
the same lab showed that the mutant GluN2B KI mice have impaired hippocampal CA1 LTP 
(reduced to ~50%) and impaired recall during the consolidation phase of a Morris water maze 
(MWM) task 1. Here, learning impairments were found in a modified MWM task that involves 
massed learning during day 1. All other learning paradigms tested here or previously were 
normal. Basal behavior was also extensively evaluated, and was found to be normal in all tasks 
tested here or previously. 
  
Evaluation: The manuscript is very well written. The experiments and the analyses are solid. The 
interpretation and discussion of the results are both careful and insightful. Overall, it can be very 
reasonably concluded that learning requires the CaMKII/GluN2B interaction only when the 
learning task is rather difficult and/or involves some stress (such as in a water maze), consistent 
also with impaired but not abolished LTP in these mice. 
  
Comments: The conclusions from this study may also inform potential future behavioral studies 
on these mice. For instance, while the GluN2B KI mice were normal in multiple variations of 
contextual fear conditioning, the contextual part of the task was made rather easy in all 
paradigms tested. However, even with shorter exposure to the context, fear conditioning may still 
be too easy of a learning task to reveal any differences in the GluN2B mice. Thus, while such 
future studies may be interesting, either outcome would still be consistent with the conclusions 
reached here. 
 
The behavioral analyses of the GluN2B KI mice were done specifically in order to evaluate the 
impact of the LTP impairments in these mice. When comparing the GluN2B KI mice with CaMKII 
T286A or CaMKII knock-out mice in other behavioral tasks in future studies, it may have to be 
taken into account that the GluN2B KI mice are impaired only in LTP, while the CaMKII mutant 
mice are additionally impaired in LTD. 
  
One point in which my opinion differs is within the introduction, specifically regarding the 
statement that “auto-phosphorylation on T286 is required for effective binding of CaMKII to GluN2B”. 
The cited references could indeed be interpreted support this statement2 3. However, newer data 
indicate that the increased binding observed after ATP addition was largely caused by direct 
nucleotide binding to the kinase, rather than by auto-phosphorylation4 5 6.

Notably, this point does not affect the validity of any conclusions reached in the manuscript. 
However, it may significantly mislead the reader about the larger context of CaMKII in synaptic 
plasticity. Recently, we have shown that CaMKII T286 phosphorylation is required not only for LTP, 
but also for LTD7. Prior to this, other recent evidence had already suggested a more prolonged 
T286 phosphorylation after LTD than after LTP8 9 10 (for review see Coultrap & Bayer, 201211). If 
T286 phosphorylation would induce the most effective CaMKII binding to GluN2B (as stated), 
binding would be expected to be more extensive after LTD compared to LTP. However, this does 
not appear to be the case 9, and the CaMKII/GluN2B interaction contributes exclusively to the 
CaMKII functions in LTP but not in LTD1.

This is an interesting article that provides additional, detailed behavioral analysis of hippocampal-
dependent spatial and contextual learning and memory performance of knock-in mice that are 
deficient in CaMKII binding to the GluN2B subunit of the NMDA-subtype ionotropic glutamate 
receptor. The current findings extend those of the authors in Halt et al. (2012) where spaced 
training over 6 days in the Morris Water Maze (MWM) revealed no deficits in spatial learning but 
did find significant deficits in consolidation of long-term memory probed several days after 
training in theses CaMKII binding-deficient GluN2B knock-in mice. 
 
Interestingly, here, using a more intense and demanding one day, massed training version of the 
MWM, the authors now detect modest deficits in these GluN2B knock-in mice, not only in memory 
probed one day after training, but also in spatial learning measured on the day of training. 
However, other single day training spatial/contextual learning and memory tests, that are both 
more aversive but less spatially challenging (contextual fear conditioning) and less aversive but 
more spatially challenging (Barnes maze), did not reveal any difference in performance between 
WT and GluN2B knock-in mice. Thus, an important conclusion of this study is that increased 
postsynaptic targeting of CaMKII and the increased level of LTP (~50%; see Halt et al.) that are 
achieved through CaMKII binding to GluN2B are only required for spatial learning when the task is 
both fairly demanding and at least moderately aversive. These findings should give the field a 
heightened appreciation that highly-compartmentalized regulation of signaling pathways by 
postsynaptic protein-protein scaffolding interactions, such as achieved through CaMKII binding to 
GluN2B during LTP-induction, may not be absolutely essential for spatial learning and memory in 
general but may have evolved to allow animals to specifically sustain optimal spatial learning and 
memory capabilities even under demanding and stressful circumstances. 
 
Overall, the manuscript is very well written and the data are rigorously analyzed and presented 
clearly.
