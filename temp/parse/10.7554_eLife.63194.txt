Abstract 
31 
 
32 
Transposable elements (TEs) are selfish genomic parasites whose ability to spread autonomously 
33 
is facilitated by sexual reproduction in their hosts. If hosts become obligately asexual, TE 
34 
frequencies and dynamics are predicted to change dramatically, but the long-term outcome is 
35 
unclear. Here, we test current theory using whole-genome sequence data from eight species of 
36 
bdelloid rotifers, a class of invertebrates where males are thus far unknown. Contrary to 
37 
expectations, we find a diverse range of active TEs in bdelloid genomes, at an overall frequency 
38 
within the range seen in sexual species. We find no evidence that TEs are spread by cryptic 
39 
recombination or restrained by unusual DNA repair mechanisms, but we report that bdelloids 
40 
share a large and unusual expansion of genes involved in RNAi-mediated TE suppression. This 
41 
suggests that enhanced cellular defence mechanisms might mitigate the deleterious effects of 
42 
active TEs and compensate for the consequences of long-term asexuality. 
43

Introduction 
46 
 
47 
Transposable elements (TEs) are repeated sequences of DNA that can mobilize and replicate 
48 
themselves within genomes [1–3]. TEs are divided into two major categories: class I 
49 
retrotransposons, which use a ‘copy-and-paste’ replication mechanism via a reverse-transcribed 
50 
RNA intermediate, and class II DNA transposons, which use ‘cut-and-paste’ replication with a 
51 
DNA intermediate. Both classes are ancient and diverse—retrotransposons are found in some 
52 
.

bacteria and nearly all eukaryotes, while DNA transposons are found across the tree of life [4–6]. 
53 
Although TE replications are occasionally beneficial [7], the vast majority are deleterious for the 
54 
host [8,9]. Costs include insertional mutations that disrupt genes [10], cellular costs of replicating 
55 
and expressing excess DNA [11], and increased risk of chromosomal abnormalities due to 
56 
ectopic recombination between homologous TE sequences interspersed through the genome 
57 
[12,13]. Despite this, by replicating autonomously as selfish elements, TEs can accumulate to 
58 
large numbers within genomes—for example, TEs comprise 46% of the human genome, 
59 
including over 1 million (~11%) nonautonomous Alu retroelements [14,15]. TE numbers vary 
60 
greatly, however, even between closely related species. In vertebrates, for example, TEs span an 
61 
order of magnitude, from below 6% to over 50% of the genome [16], with similarly large 
62 
variation observed within and between other groups such as arthropods [17], nematodes [18], 
63 
and fungi [19]. Explaining this variation is vital to understanding the mechanisms affecting TE 
64 
spread and control. 
65 
 
66 
Sexual reproduction has long been thought to play a major role in TE dynamics within 
67 
eukaryotes. On the one hand, sexual reproduction and outcrossing decouples the fate of TEs from 
68 
other host genes, allowing them to jump into new genomic backgrounds and to behave as selfish 
69 
genomic parasites [1,2,20]. On the other hand, sex enables the efficient removal of deleterious 
70 
insertions from populations through recombination and segregation [21–23]. The risk of 
71 
chromosome abnormalities due to ectopic recombination, arguably the main cost of high TE 
72 
loads in eukaryotes [9,24], also occurs during chromosome pairing at meiosis. Sex therefore 
73 
plays opposing roles—it permits spread and selfish behaviour of TEs, and yet it facilitates and 
74 
strengthens selection against high loads. Variation in TE content among taxa might thus result 
75 
from shifts in the balance of these different opposing forces. 
76 
 
77 
By this logic, the loss of sexual reproduction should affect TE dynamics dramatically. Since 
78 
asexual lineages generally arise from sexual species [25], it is likely that they initially harbor 
79 
many active TEs [26,27]. All else being equal, the loss of recombination will limit the ability of 
80 
selection to remove deleterious insertions from a fully linked host genome, and so the load of 
81 
TEs should accumulate. At the same time, the fate of TEs is immediately coupled to that of the 
82 
host genome, resulting in intensified selection for inactivation, excision or domestication of the 
83 
elements [2,22,27–29]. The genomes of asexual lineages whose TEs continued to replicate 
84 
unchecked would become overrun, potentially leading to extinction of the lineage and the TEs 
85 
themselves. While some TEs could be maintained by horizontal transfer between species  
86 
(especially class II DNA elements [6,30]) or by having beneficial effects (as in bacteria, [31,32]), 
87 
other TEs—particularly the class I LINE-like (i.e. non–long terminal repeat [LTR]) 
88 
retrotransposons—are thought to be transmitted almost exclusively vertically [5,33,34], and 
89 
therefore depend strongly on sex for their persistence. 
90 
 
91 
Models of the population genetics of vertically transmitted TEs in asexuals predict one of two 
92 
outcomes: either TEs accumulate within lineages faster than they can be removed, overrunning 
93 
each lineage in turn and driving the population extinct, or, conversely, TE removal outweighs 
94 
proliferation and the population eventually purges itself entirely of deleterious TEs [27,35,36]. 
95 
These predictions are difficult to test empirically, however, because the time required for a 
96 
population to arrive at either extinction or redemption is expected to be on the order of millions 
97 
of generations [27], too long to observe directly and beyond the lifespan of most asexual lineages 
98 
[37,38]. 
99 
 
100 
Here, we test these ideas in a well-known group of asexual animals, the bdelloid rotifers. These 
101 
microscopic invertebrates appear to have reproduced without males or meiosis for tens of 
102 
.

3 
millions of years, diversifying into hundreds of species within limno-terrestrial and freshwater 
103 
habitats globally [39,40]. Bdelloids sampled from nature (and those reared in the laboratory) 
104 
consist entirely of parthenogenetic females, and neither males nor hermaphrodites are described 
105 
for any species despite centuries of close observation by naturalists [39,41,42]. Genetic and 
106 
genomic evidence for their proposed ancient and obligate asexuality remains uncertain, however. 
107 
Initial evidence of long-term asexuality [43,44] has been refuted by later studies or confounded 
108 
by alternative explanations [45–47]. Some recent studies have proposed alternative modes of 
109 
inter-individual genetic exchange, but these suggestions would require exotic mechanisms 
110 
unknown in other animals [44,48], or rates of sex that are difficult to reconcile with the lack of 
111 
observed males [49]. While the precise nature of reproduction in bdelloids remains an open 
112 
question, nonetheless they provide a unique test-case for models of TE evolution when 
113 
conventional sex is absent or strikingly rare. 
114 
 
115 
Initial PCR-based surveys of five bdelloid genomes found no evidence of class I 
116 
retrotransposons from either the LTR or LINE-like superfamilies, but did reveal a diverse array 
117 
of class II DNA transposons, mostly at low copy number [50]. The presence of class II TEs in 
118 
bdelloids might be explained by horizontal transfer, which is thought to occur more frequently 
119 
for class II TEs with DNA intermediates [6,30,33,34] (but see [51]). The apparent lack of 
120 
retrotransposons contrasted sharply, however, with their near ubiquity in other taxa. At the time, 
121 
the absence of class I TEs appeared consistent with the view that long-term asexual evolution in 
122 
bdelloids had caused the loss of parasitic elements that depended on sexual transmission 
123 
[22,27,50,52]. 
124 
 
125 
Another unusual aspect of bdelloid physiology was suggested to contribute to their seemingly 
126 
low TE complement. In most bdelloid species (but not all), individuals can survive complete 
127 
desiccation at any life stage via a process called anhydrobiosis (‘life without water’). Desiccation 
128 
causes double-strand breakages (DSBs) in DNA, but bdelloids are able to repair these and 
129 
recover to an unusual degree [53–55]. It was proposed that anhydrobiosis might influence TE 
130 
evolution in two ways [27,52,56]. First, DSB repair could aid TE removal, either via gene 
131 
conversion from a homologous chromosome lacking the TE insertion, or excision of mis-paired 
132 
regions. Second, the pairing of homologous chromosomes, if required during DSB-repair, could 
133 
provide a context for ongoing selection against chromosomal abnormalities caused by ectopic 
134 
recombination. In either case, anhydrobiosis would decrease the number of TEs, potentially 
135 
helping to explain the low overall TE content encoded in bdelloid genomes. 
136 
 
137 
These early ideas were transformed by more detailed studies of the model bdelloid species 
138 
Adineta vaga, which used refined methods and genome-scale data to discover a variety of 
139 
retrotransposon families. These include an endonuclease-deficient Penelope-like element (PLE) 
140 
designated Athena [57,58], which is itself incorporated within much larger and highly unusual 
141 
retroelements called Terminons [59]; another PLE that has retained its endonuclease [60], LTR 
142 
retrotransposons (Juno, Vesta, TelKA and Mag [61,62]), and LINE-like retrotransposons (R4, R9, 
143 
Hebe, RTE, Tx1 and Soliton [44,63,64]). In total, TEs accounted for 2.2% of the 217 Mb genome 
144 
(~4.8 Mb) [44], rising to ~4% on inclusion of the recently discovered giant Terminon elements 
145 
[59]. The conclusion that bdelloids lack class I TEs therefore no longer holds, and the predicted 
146 
effects of asexuality and anhydrobiosis on TE evolution remain open questions that are amenable 
147 
to testing with comparative genomics. Specifically, the comparison of desiccating species with 
148 
those few bdelloid rotifer lineages that are unable to survive desiccation would indicate whether 
149 
anhydrobiosis does limit TE numbers as hypothesized. Also, comparisons within populations 
150 
could shed light on the activity of TEs and whether bdelloids possess cryptic forms of 
151 
recombination that could aid in TE removal or facilitate TE spread.

153 
Here, we test the predicted effects of asexuality and anhydrobiosis on TE evolution by 
154 
comparing 42 rotifer genomes belonging to 15 taxonomic species. Our sample includes both 
155 
desiccating and nondesiccating bdelloids, and eight monogonont rotifers [65–67], a separate 
156 
class that alternates sexual and asexual reproduction and cannot survive desiccation as adults. 
157 
Results are set in context by comparison to published genomes from an acanthocephalan [68] 
158 
(now classified with rotifers in the Phylum Syndermata) and a range of other animal phyla. We 
159 
ask six questions raised by theory. (1) How does the abundance and diversity of TEs in bdelloids 
160 
differ from that in other animals, including sexual rotifers? (2) Are TEs recently and currently 
161 
active in all bdelloids? (3) Can we detect signatures of recombination affecting bdelloid TEs, as 
162 
might be expected if bdelloids do have cryptic forms of sexual reproduction? (4) Do desiccating 
163 
species contain fewer TEs than nondesiccating species, as previously theorized? (5) Are TEs in 
164 
bdelloids under the same selective constraints as in other taxa? (6) Finally, do bdelloids possess 
165 
alternative molecular mechanisms that might help to keep their TEs under control, as might be 
166 
expected if the ability to control TEs by sexual reproduction is absent or reduced?

Results and Discussion 
170 
 
171 
High-quality population genomics data for bdelloid rotifers. To quantify variation in repeat 
172 
content within and between bdelloid species, we generated de novo whole-genome assemblies 
173 
for 31 rotifer samples encompassing nine species (Fig 1a; Table 1; S1 Data). Three of these 
174 
assemblies were generated using 10x Genomics linked-read data (for Adineta steineri, Rotaria 
175 
sordida, and Rotaria sp. ‘Silwood-1’), while 26 are from single-individual samples. In order to 
176 
capture as many potential repeats as possible, we generated two assemblies for each sample: a 
177 
‘reference’ assembly, with a focus on quality and contiguity, and a ‘maximum haplotype’ 
178 
(maxhap) assembly that included small or highly similar contigs that might be derived from 
179 
recent TE duplications or other sources of copy number variation, at the expense of contiguity. 
180 
 
181 
Reference genomes showed an expected scaffold size (AU, see Materials and methods) ranging 
182 
from 21.1 kb (Didymodactylos carnosus) to 702.3 kb (R. sp. ‘Silwood-1’) and BUSCO scores 
183 
that indicated 89–98% of 303 core eukaryote genes were completely recovered, increasing to 96–
184 
99% if fragmented copies are included (Table 1). General genome characteristics such as 
185 
genome size (assembly span), the proportion of G + C nucleotides (GC%), the number of coding 
186 
genes (CDS), and the level of homologous divergence (number of SNPs identified within CDS) 
187 
were within the range expected from previous analyses of bdelloid genomes [44,46] (Fig 1b–c; 
188 
Table 1; S1 Fig). Intragenomic collinearity and synonymous divergence of coding regions in the 
189 
A. steineri, R. sordida and R. sp. ‘Silwood-1’ maximum haplotype assemblies reveal the 
190 
characteristic signature of degenerate tetraploidy that has been found in all bdelloid species 
191 
examined to date (Fig 1d). 
192 
 
193 
Compared to the reference set, maxhap assemblies generally showed increased span (mean 
194 
increase = 17.9 Mb ± 21.5 standard deviation [SD]) and were substantially more fragmented, as 
195 
expected (S1 Table). Nonetheless, BUSCO completeness scores remained high, with 76% to 
196 
98% of genes completely recovered (increasing to 95–98% if fragmented copies are included), 
197 
indicating that the majority of core genes are successfully captured (S1 Table). The BUSCO 
198 
duplication metric (‘D’) does not increase greatly between reference and maxhap assemblies, 
199 
which shows that the additional sequences retained in the maxhap assemblies do not contain 
200 
complete extra copies of core genes. Thus, the maxhap assemblies are not fully haplotype-
201 
resolved representations of the genome, except in the case of the three 10x assemblies.

To these new data, we added published genomes for seven monogonont taxa (one from the 
210 
Brachionus calyciflorus species complex [65] and six from four species of the Brachionus 
211 
plicatilis species complex, namely B. asplanchnoidis, B. plicatilis sensu stricto (HYR1), B. 
212 
rotundiformis, and B. sp. ‘Tiscar’ [66,67]) and four bdelloids (A. vaga, Adineta ricciae, Rotaria 
213 
magnacalcarata and Rotaria macrura [44,46]), yielding a total of 42 rotifer genomes. Of these, 
214 
11 samples belong to nondesiccating bdelloid species (five individuals each from R. 
215 
magnacalcarata and Rotaria socialis, and the previously published genome of R. macrura).

241 
Abundant and diverse TEs in bdelloid genomes. To ascertain the repeat content of bdelloid 
242 
genomes relative to other taxa in a consistent manner, we used the RepeatModeler and 
243 
RepeatMasker pipelines to identify and classify repeats across genomes. The total proportion of 
244 
the genome classified as repetitive ranged from ~19% to 45% across bdelloid genera, with 
245 
variation within and between species (Fig 2a; S2 Fig; S3 Fig; S2 Data; S3 Data). Most of these 
246 
are simple or unclassified repeats that do not belong to major TE superfamilies. While the 
247 
precise nature of these unclassified repeats is not elucidated, an appreciable fraction (~7–27%, 
248 
mean = 17%) are also annotated as protein-coding and thus may be derived from gene 
249 
expansions or other duplications, while a further small fraction (< 1%) are accounted for by an 
250 
additional survey of small, nonautonomous class II TEs called miniature inverted-repeats 
251 
(MITEs) (S2 Data). The proportion of the genome accounted for by known TEs was much 
252 
smaller, ranging from 2.4% to 7.3% (mean = 4.9% ± 1.2 standard deviations [SD], median = 
253 
5.1%) in bdelloids. Broken down by class and superfamily, the mean values are: class I total = 
254 
2.09% ± 0.75 (PLEs = 0.59% ± 0.14; LTRs = 0.68% ± 0.26; and LINEs = 0.82% ± 0.47); class II 
255 
total = 2.79 ± 0.8 (DNA transposons = 2.49% ± 0.77; rolling circles = 0.30 ± 0.11). These results 
256 
are in broad agreement with previous estimates of TE content in bdelloids [44,46,47,59]. 
257 
 
258 
We first compare these values to closely related sexual lineages in the phylum Syndermata, the 
259 
monogonont rotifers and acanthocephalans. The most striking difference relates to the recently 
260 
published genome of the obligately sexual acanthocephalan Pomphorhynchus laevis [68], which 
261 
encodes a substantially greater proportion of repeats than either bdelloids or monogononts. In 
262 
agreement with Mauer et al., we find ~66% of the P. laevis genome to be composed of repeats. 
263 
The large majority are class I retrotransposons (~71% of the total TE content) from the LINE 
264 
(~52%) and PLE (~15%) superfamilies, and there are relatively few DNA transposons (~1.3%) 
265 
(Fig 2b). There is increasing evidence that acanthocephalans may be the closest relatives to the 
266 
Class Bdelloidea [69–71]. However, all members of the Acanthocephala (also known as the 
267 
thorny-headed worms) are obligate endoparasites and are highly differentiated in both 
268 
morphological and molecular terms from other syndermatans. It is unclear whether these features 
269 
may contribute to the high repeat content and other unusual genome characteristics of P. laevis 
270 
[68]. 
271 
 
272 
In monogononts, the mean values for class I TEs is 5.2% ± 1.5 SD and for class II TEs it is 2.5% 
273 
± 1.0 SD. Thus, monogononts are slightly more TE-rich than bdelloids, but also substantially 
274 
more variable between species (Fig 2a; S3 Fig). Repeat content differs between bdelloids and 
275 
monogononts in two main ways, both in regard to the composition of class I retrotransposons. 
276 
First, monogononts encode substantially more LINE-like retroelements than bdelloids, making 
277 
up (on average) approximately 50% and 16% of the total TE content in each clade respectively. 
278 
The frequency of LINEs is of particular interest, because this class of TEs is thought to be least 
279 
likely to undergo horizontal transfer and thus the most dependent on sex for transmission 
280 
[5,33,34]. Second, Penelope-like elements (PLEs) have increased in proportion in all bdelloids 
281 
relative to monogononts, from ~1% in monogononts to ~12% in bdelloids on average.

Interestingly, a high proportion of PLEs is also seen in the acanthocephalan P. laevis, while a 
283 
high proportion of LINEs is found in both D. carnosus isolates (~35% of total TE content), a 
284 
deeply branching lineage sister to all other bdelloid taxa included in the analyses. Thus, 
285 
assuming that acanthocephalans are the closest relatives to bdelloids, the most parsimonious 
286 
explanation for these broad-scale patterns is that the expansion of PLEs occurred in the ancestor 
287 
to bdelloids and acanthocephalans, whereas the contraction of LINEs has occurred more 
288 
recently, confined to a subset of bdelloid genera.  
289 
 
290 
To put these differences in TE content among rotifers in a broader context, we applied the same 
291 
repeat-finding pipeline to animals from a range of more distantly related protostome phyla: three 
292 
insects, a nematode, two tardigrades, five molluscs, two annelids, a brachiopod, platyhelminth 
293 
and orthonectid [72–83] (S2 Table). As expected, both the abundance and diversity of TEs varied 
294 
widely across taxa (Fig 2b). Total TE content ranged from 0.8% (the insect Polypedilum 
295 
vanderplanki) to ~24% (octopus and platyhelminth). Although the acanthocephalan genome 
296 
appears to be particularly rich in TEs, bdelloids (except for D. carnosus) have modest amounts 
297 
of TEs, including class I TEs specifically, while in monogononts these amounts vary greatly 
298 
among species. All bdelloids encode relatively more TEs than both Polypedilum species but 
299 
fewer than Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, annelid worms and some 
300 
molluscs, and are intermediate with respect to other taxa. Note that TE proportion in molluscs, 
301 
nematodes and flatworms is known to be highly variable (e.g. [18]), while bdelloids display 
302 
much less variability barring the early-branching D. carnosus.

(b) Equivalent repeat content analysis in 17 protostome animal genomes, including the model species D. 
318 
melanogaster and C. elegans, the recently published acanthocephalan rotifer P. laevis, and selected 
319 
other species from across the protostome group. Two further examples of desiccating (orange ‘D’) and 
320 
nondesiccating (blue ‘ND’) species pairs are shown: the insects P. nubifer and P. vanderplanki and the 
321 
tardigrades H. exemplaris and R. varieornatus. 
322 
 
323 
 
324 
These results show that bdelloid species encode an abundant diversity of both class I and II TEs, 
325 
and, set against the repeat content of other rotifers and animals, do not appear particularly 
326 
deficient or unusual with regard to the proportion of nucleotides encoding transposable elements. 
327 
Although the bdelloids do have lower frequencies of class I TEs (~16% of total TE content) than 
328 
the monogononts (~50%) or the acanthocephalan (~52%), as predicted by theory for elements 
329 
dependent on vertical transmission, they still possess them in numbers that are comparable to  
330 
sexual organisms (e.g. C. elegans). Furthermore, the basally divergent bdelloid D. carnosus did 
331 
not show the same magnitude of decrease in LINEs (~35%), indicating that different dynamics 
332 
may be at play in different lineages. Thus, it is clear that the most simplistic expectations of TE 
333 
evolution under the hypothesis of long-term asexuality (i.e., either runaway proliferation or 
334 
complete elimination) are not met, necessitating an evaluation of possible explanations that may 
335 
align theory with observation. 
336 
 
337 
TE transposition is recent and ongoing. One possible explanation is that TEs in bdelloid 
338 
genomes do not replicate autonomously or are otherwise inactivated or ‘fossilised’ within their 
339 
host genome. To investigate this, we first generated divergence ‘landscapes’ for identified TE 
340 
copies within each genome, using the de novo RepeatMasker results. TE landscapes measure the 
341 
amount of sequence divergence between each TE copy and a consensus derived from all copies 
342 
in its family [84]. Histograms of the resulting Kimura distances (K-values [85]) provide insights 
343 
into the evolutionary history of TE activity [16,86,87]. 
344 
 
345 
TE landscapes for the three diploid (10x Genomics) assemblies of A. steineri, R. sp. ‘Silwood-1’ 
346 
and R. sordida show that TE divergence is bimodal but strongly zero-inflated (Fig 3). A large 
347 
number of TE copies have very low or no divergence from the consensus (K-value ≤ 1%). 
348 
Assuming a molecular clock for nucleotide substitutions within duplicated TEs, such elements 
349 
represent recent duplications that are highly similar to their progenitor copy, consistent with 
350 
recent transposition of an active element. In proportion, most of these belong to class II DNA 
351 
transposon superfamilies (in red), but the spike of zero divergence is also present for class I 
352 
retrotransposons (in blue and green). An older, broader mode is seen around a K-value of 20–
353 
30% that probably reflects historical TE transpositions and/or a signal from the tetraploid 
354 
genome structure present in all bdelloids sequenced to date. The same pattern was observed in 
355 
the haplotype-resolved assemblies of A. vaga [44] and A. ricciae [46] (Fig 3b; S4 Fig), and was 
356 
generally present but less pronounced in the other ‘maxhap’ assemblies depending on the repeat 
357 
pipeline applied (S4 Fig; S5 Fig).

Fig 3. TE divergence landscapes for selected genomes. The X-axes show the level of divergence 
363 
(Kimura substitution level, CpG adjusted) between each identified TE copy and the consensus sequence 
364 
for that TE family (the inferred ancestral copy). Thus, if newly arising TE copies evolve neutrally, the 
365 
amount of divergence is a proxy for the time since its duplication, with older copies accumulating more 
366 
substitutions and appearing further to the right. The Y-axis shows the proportion of the genome occupied 
367 
by each bin. Colours represent TE superfamilies (see legend) and shades of colour represent different TE 
368 
families within each superfamily. Data are shown for the 10x Genomics diploid (‘megabubbles’) 
369 
assemblies of A. steineri, R. sp. ‘Silwood-1’ and R. sordida compared to the published genome of A. 
370

373 
To evaluate recent TE activity further, we developed a simple method to identify insertion sites 
374 
for LTR retrotransposons (LTR-Rs) and assess their presence or absence in related individuals. 
375 
Because most LTR-Rs insert into random genome locations [5,8], the neighbouring genome 
376 
sequence provides a unique marker for a given insertion event [88]. We constructed a library of 
377 
such insertion markers (‘LTR-tags’) for all ‘full-length’ LTR-Rs (i.e. those with long-terminal 
378 
repeats present at both the 5’ and 3’ ends of the element) detected in our genomes, and then 
379 
searched for their presence or absence in the other samples. For a given LTR-tag identified in 
380 
genome A, the presence of a contiguous alignment in genome B indicates that the same insertion 
381 
is shared between A and B.  
382 
 
383 
For a set of 161 high-confidence and non-redundant LTR-Rs identified in the single-individual 
384 
samples, alignment contiguity for each LTR-tag versus each of the other genomes was scored 
385 
using a read-mapping approach (see Materials and methods), resulting in a pairwise matrix of 
386 
presence/absence scores (Fig 4a; S4 Data). High scores for LTR insertion-site presence

correlated strongly with the phylogeny, resulting in an average score of ~0.9 within species 
388 
compared to < 0.1 between species and a clear visual signal along the diagonal of Fig 4a. Very 
389 
few LTR insertion sites were shared between bdelloid species. While some absences could 
390 
reflect loss rather than gain, the restriction of nearly all LTR insertion sites to single species 
391 
indicates that they have been gained during the separate evolutionary history of that species.  
392 
 
393 
LTR-R insertions also vary between individuals within the same species, indicating recent 
394 
transposition events and the potential for ongoing fitness consequences for the host. One case-
395 
study is illustrated for R. magnacalcarata (Fig 4b; S6 Fig). The individuals RM9 and RM15 
396 
share an LTR-R insertion that is not present in conspecifics. Aligning the regions of the genome 
397 
assemblies containing these LTR-tags indicates that an 8.1 kb LTR-R has inserted into a protein-
398 
coding sequence in the lineage leading to RM9 and RM15. It has introduced a premature stop 
399 
codon to a gene that encodes a protein (7,479 residues) of unknown function but with partial 
400 
similarity to midasin, an ATPase essential to ribosome biosynthesis in several model eukaryotes 
401 
[89,90]. In RM9 and RM15, the predicted product is substantially truncated (to 6,025 residues) 
402 
by the element insertion. Despite the potential fitness consequences, RM9 and RM15 have 
403 
evidently persisted for some time since, because they differ at approximately 0.5% of single-
404 
nucleotide sites across the 8.1 kb LTR element itself. A possible explanation is that both the 
405 
RM9 and RM15 assemblies also contain a scaffold with an empty insertion site, indicating an 
406 
intact version of the coding sequence spanned by the LTR insertion (represented in Fig. 4b by 
407 
the partial matches on scaffolds 16719 and 07127, respectively). If the insertion is hemizygous, 
408 
an uninterrupted homologous copy of the affected gene might mask or reduce the effect of the 
409 
mutation. Given the degenerate tetraploid structure of bdelloid genomes, further homoeologous 
410 
copies (i.e. derived from whole-genome duplication) might provide additional functional 
411 
redundancy and help perform critical functions of interrupted genes.

Support for the presence of a given LTR-R at a specific insertion site in each genome is scored from 0

428 
Thus, these data contradict the idea that bdelloid TEs are inactive. All TE superfamilies in other 
429 
bdelloids show a substantial fraction of copies at low-divergence, indicative of recent 
430 
proliferation. Moreover, there are multiple cases of insertion-site polymorphism within species, 
431 
and at least one case where a recent retroelement insertion into a protein-coding sequence seems 
432 
likely to have potential fitness consequences.  
433 
 
434 
No evidence that cryptic recombination helps to limit the spread of LTR-Rs. Another 
435 
possible explanation for the apparent discrepancy between bdelloid TE profiles and theory is that 
436 
bdelloids in fact possess cryptic inter-individual recombination, either through undetected sex or 
437 
some alternative form of gene transfer. We therefore tested for a signature of recombination 
438 
among polymorphic LTR-R insertion sites within species. Under strict clonality, the pattern of 
439 
presence and absence across LTR-R loci should be nested and compatible with only mutational 
440 
gain and loss at each site. In contrast, in a sexual, outcrossing population, variation should be 
441 
shuffled among loci. LTR-Rs provide a powerful test of these predictions because random 
442 
insertion makes independent origins of the same LTR-R insertion site highly unlikely.  
443 
 
444 
In every species with multiple samples, we found that variation in polymorphic TEs is perfectly 
445 
nested, with a consistency index in parsimony reconstruction of 1. Furthermore, in the two 
446 
species with multiple parsimony-informative characters, R. socialis and R. magnacalcarata, we 
447 
found a significantly positive index of association of presence and absences among LTR-R 
448 
insertion sites, as expected with clonal inheritance (S3 Table; S6 Fig). Approximate Bayesian 
449 
Computation with simulations of expected patterns under varying frequencies of sexual 
450 
reproduction showed that strictly clonal evolution could not be rejected (S7 Fig). While this test 
451 
uses a restricted set of markers, and so should not be viewed as a test of recombination for the 
452 
whole genome or species, it does support clonal inheritance of LTR-R loci and finds no evidence 
453 
that inter-individual recombination helps to limit their spread. Nevertheless, local LTR-LTR 
454 
recombination within genomes, leading to solo LTR formation, may act to bring the copy 
455 
number down [44]. 
456 
 
457 
No evidence for lower TE loads in desiccating bdelloids. The desiccation hypothesis posits 
458 
that TE numbers may be kept in check via the action of DSB-repair processes during recovery 
459 
from desiccation. Our study includes 11 nondesiccating bdelloid samples encompassing three 
460 
obligately aquatic species (R. macrura, R. magnacalcarata and R. socialis), while the remaining 
461 
samples were isolated from ephemeral ponds or moss and must undergo frequent cycles of 
462 
desiccation and rehydration to survive. Contrary to the prediction that TE load should be reduced 
463 
in desiccating species, there is little overall difference in TE proportions between desiccating and 
464 
nondesiccating lineages (mean = 4.8% ± 1.3% vs. 5.0% ± 0.9% respectively). Broken down by 
465 
TE superfamily, desiccating taxa have relatively more DNA transposons, simple, low complexity 
466 
and unclassified repeats, and relatively fewer PLE, LTR and LINE-like retroelements (S3 Fig; 
467 
S8a Fig), with the biggest differences seen between Rotaria lineages (S8b Fig). However, 
468 
perhaps unsurprisingly given only two independent shifts in desiccation ability within our sample 
469 
(see phylogeny in Fig 2a), results from a Bayesian mixed-effects modelling approach that 
470 
controlled for phylogenetic relationships showed no significant correlations between desiccation 
471 
ability and TE load, for either overall proportion or for any individual TE superfamily (S4 
472 
Table). For most TE superfamilies the strength of the phylogenetic signal (λ) was close to 1 (S9 
473 
Fig), consistent with a high fit of the data to the phylogeny under a Brownian motion model as 
474 
would be expected if TE load evolves neutrally along branches of the phylogeny.

Two further comparisons of desiccating versus nondesiccating species among our wider sample 
477 
of animals also present contrasting results. In chironomid midges, the desiccation-tolerant P. 
478 
vanderplanki encodes substantially fewer TEs than its nondesiccating sister species P. nubifer, as 
479 
predicted (0.8% and 2.2% respectively, although this rises to ~11% in both species when all 
480 
repeats are included). In tardigrades, however, the desiccation tolerant Ramazzottius 
481 
varieornatus encodes a greater proportion of TEs than Hypsibius exemplaris (4.3% and 2.8%, 
482 
respectively), which does not survive desiccation without extensive conditioning [81], although 
483 
the trend is reversed when all repeats are included due to a large fraction of simple repeats in H. 
484 
exemplaris. We therefore find no consistent evidence for the hypothesised link between 
485 
anhydrobiosis and TE load in bdelloids or beyond. The overall effect of desiccation on TEs 
486 
might be dual: while repair of a DSB within a TE via non-homologous end-joining would likely 
487 
result in its inactivation (thus acting to reduce TE load), an efficient DSB repair system would 
488 
enhance repair of DSBs that arise during transposition of cut-and-paste DNA TEs that leave a 
489 
DSB behind upon excision (thus allowing an increased TE load). 
490 
 
491 
Bdelloids experience similar selective constraints on TEs as do other species. A fourth 
492 
hypothesis is that the selective environment for TEs is different in bdelloids than in other 
493 
animals, thereby shifting their TE profiles compared to simple theory. For instance, bdelloids 
494 
might tolerate insertions within genes unusually well, owing to redundancy arising from 
495 
tetraploidy or multiple gene copies [45,91,92]. First, we explored the genomic ‘environment’ of 
496 
TE insertions and their potential effects on genome function. Differences in the location of TE 
497 
insertions might reveal differential costs and benefits compared to other taxa. To do this, we first 
498 
compiled a high-confidence list of class I retrotransposons by searching for proteins with 
499 
significant similarity to the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain found in all retrotransposons. 
500 
Phylogenies of the resulting alignments showed a diverse array of RTs in all species, most of 
501 
them full-length (in terms of conserved subdomain presence) and clustered within the three 
502 
primary retrotransposon superfamilies of PLEs, LTRs and LINEs (Fig 5a; S10 Fig; S5 Data). 
503 
Many (but not all) clustered within families previously identified in A. vaga. The elevated LINE 
504 
content in D. carnosus in comparison to other bdelloids is mostly due to the expanded Soliton 
505 
clade and to the presence of CR1-Zenon and Tad/I/Outcast clades, the latter being characterized 
506 
by the presence of the RNase H domain. 
507 
 
508 
We then characterised surrounding genome features for these TEs. In 50 kb windows 
509 
surrounding each class I TE identified above, we counted the occurrence and span of three 
510 
features of interest: other (non-TE) genes, other (non-focal) TEs, and the telomeric repeat 
511 
“TGTGGG” (identified from A. vaga [58] and supported in other rotifers, see S2 Note). Relative 
512 
to a set of core metazoan (BUSCO) genes, the regions surrounding PLE, LINE and LTR TEs all 
513 
showed significant decreases in gene density, but significant increases in both TE and sub-
514 
telomeric repeat density (Fig 5b–d; S5 Table). In contrast, using a linear mixed-effects 
515 
modelling approach (see Materials and methods), there were no significant differences between 
516 
the monogonont B. calyciflorus and bdelloids, or between desiccating and nondesiccating 
517 
bdelloid species (S5 Table). These results are consistent with previous findings that TEs are 
518 
mainly confined to sub-telomeric regions of bdelloid genomes [56], a bias that is presumably due 
519 
to either selection against insertions at or near functioning genes and/or strong specificity in TE 
520 
insertion site. Thus, it appears that most TE insertions are costly in bdelloid rotifers, as in other 
521 
taxa, and that selection leads to their concentration outside of gene-rich regions.

As a second source of selective constraints, we tested for evidence of selection against ectopic 
548 
recombination (ER). ER is argued to be a major cost of TEs in sexual taxa, but its effects derive 
549 
from chromosomal abnormalities during meiosis, which should be lacking in bdelloids. Because 
550 
the rate of ER increases with both the number of elements and their length [12], the strength of 
551 
selection is expected to be strongest against longer TEs at higher copy number [9,24,93]. Two 
552 
testable predictions arise: first, that bdelloids should have longer TEs than sexual taxa (under the 
553 
hypothesis that ER is absent in bdelloids because of a lack of meiosis), and second, that 
554 
nondesiccating bdelloids should have longer TEs than desiccating bdelloids (under the 
555 
hypothesis that ER may still occur when chromosomes pair during the repair of DSBs). 
556 
However, comparisons of TE length distributions provide no evidence for these predictions—
557 
there was no significant difference between monogononts and bdelloids, or between desiccating 
558 
and nondesiccating bdelloids (Fig 6a; S6 Table; S6 Data). Thus, while the precise estimation of 
559 
TE lengths will no doubt improve with increasing assembly contiguity, our current data do not 
560 
show any indication of changes in TE length linked to asexuality (when compared to 
561 
monogononts) or desiccation ability within bdelloids. It is interesting to note that this finding 
562 
also applies to the PLEs, which include the Athena elements that comprise the unusually large 
563 
and complex Terminon elements found at bdelloid telomeres [59,94]. In this case, it is possible 
564 
that selection may still act on individual Athena elements but does not affect Terminons per se 
565 
because their structural diversity and genomic location does not make them targets of ER. 
566 
 
567 
A final prediction of selection against ER is that there should be a negative correlation between 
568 
TE frequency and length, as is observed in Drosophila [24] and humans [93]. For both 
569 
monogononts and bdelloids, the majority of identified TEs are short (< 1 kb), which are 
570 
presumably partial matches or degraded copies. Nonetheless, we observe a sharp decline in copy 
571 
number as mean TE length increases above ~0.5 kb, and a distinct lack of longer elements at 
572 
higher copy numbers (Fig 6b). In vertebrates, previous work has suggested a lower threshold of 
573 
~0.6–1 kb under which ectopic recombination does not operate [93,95]. Thus, the observed 
574 
patterns in rotifers are consistent with the hypothesis that longer elements above a certain length 
575 
threshold are selected against more strongly due to the deleterious effects of ectopic 
576 
recombination. This finding is contrary to a similar analysis performed on TEs in nematodes, 
577 
which did not recover the expected relationship [18]. However, the pattern is the same in both 
578 
desiccating and nondesiccating bdelloid representatives as well as the monogonont B. 
579 
calyciflorus, and to some extent the acanthocephalan P. laevis (S11 Fig), suggesting that 
580 
selection against longer TEs at higher copy number is a general feature in Syndermata, 
581 
regardless of desiccation ability.

Large expansion of TE silencing pathways in bdelloids. Having rejected a range of hypotheses 
600 
to reconcile theory and observation of TE levels in bdelloid rotifers, we finally looked for 
601 
expansions and/or diversifications in the molecular pathways that defend against TEs. We 
602 
characterised copy number variation for three well-known gene families with direct roles in TE 
603 
suppression via RNA interference (RNAi). (1) Argonaute proteins of both the Ago and Piwi 
604 
subfamilies, the core effectors of RNAi gene-silencing that form complexes with various classes 
605 
of small RNA [96,97]; (2) Dicer, an RNase III–family protein that cleaves double-stranded RNA 
606 
(dsRNA) molecules from ‘target’ genes into shorter fragments that are subsequently incorporated 
607 
into Argonaute complexes [98,99]; and (3) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), an RNA 
608 
replicase that synthesises secondary small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that amplify the silencing 
609 
response [98,100]. 
610 
 
611 
Based on hidden Markov model (HMM) matches of key domains to the predicted proteomes of 
612 
the Illumina maxhap assemblies (in which homologous copies are largely collapsed), we detect 
613 
an average of 21.5 putative Argonaute copies, 3.9 Dicer copies and 37.3 RdRP copies in bdelloid 
614 
genomes (Fig 7a; S4 Data). These expansions are substantially larger than previously uncovered 
615 
from the diploid assembly of A. vaga (eight Dicers, 23 Ago/Piwi, 20 RdRP per diploid genome) 
616 
[44], particularly after correcting for the assembly resolution (i.e. diploid vs haploid assembly; 
617 
see Materials and methods), perhaps due to the increased sensitivity of the HMM-based 
618 
approach, or to different degrees of pseudogenization and/or homolog collapse. Phylogenies of 
619 
identified copies revealed a number of divergent clades, particularly in the Argonaute and RdRP 
620 
families (Fig 7b–d; S12 Fig; S7 Data; S8 Data), that might indicate both expansion and

diversification of these proteins. Even accounting for degenerate tetraploidy in bdelloids, the 
622 
RdRP domain in particular is significantly expanded relative to monogononts and other 
623 
eukaryotes (Fig 7e–g; S9 Data). This expansion is not found in the monogononts B. calyciflorus 
624 
or B. plicatilis HYR1, nor is there evidence for it in the (unannotated) acanthocephalan genome 
625 
(S4 Data), suggesting that the expansions seen in Ago and (particularly) RdRP are unique to 
626 
bdelloids, including the basally divergent D. carnosus. 
627 
 
628 
The expansion of bdelloid-specific Ago genes (denoted ‘BDAGOs’ in Fig 7) is comparable to 
629 
the ‘worm-specific’ Ago clade (WAGOs) found in nematodes [101–103]. Intriguingly, the 
630 
majority of nematode species (although not C. elegans) have apparently lost their Piwi-like 
631 
orthologue, the branch of the Argonaute family that is usually involved in TE suppression in 
632 
most other animals [104], but instead mediate TE silencing using a Dicer/RdRP pathway [105]. 
633 
The primary function of RdRP is to amplify RNAi responses via the production of small 
634 
interfering RNAs (siRNAs) [98], but this family is found only rarely in animal genomes [100]. In 
635 
C. elegans, RdRP-generated siRNAs (known as ‘22G-RNAs’) also play important roles in the 
636 
recognition of ‘self’ versus ‘non-self’ RNA and multigenerational (i.e., inherited) epigenetic 
637 
memory [103,106]. However, an analysis of TE variation across the nematode phylum found no 
638 
effect of RNAi pathway differences (in terms of presence/absence of RNAi genes) among 
639 
species, concluding that TE content is mediated primarily by the stochastic action of genetic drift 
640 
[18]. 
641 
 
642 
Why do bdelloids possess such a marked expansion of gene silencing machinery? One 
643 
explanation may be that it was required as part of the successful long-term transition to 
644 
asexuality, if other mechanisms usually acting in sexual populations were no longer operating. 
645 
Intriguingly, it has been shown in A. vaga that piwi-interacting small RNAs (piRNAs) target 
646 
both TEs and putatively ‘foreign’ genes (i.e. non-metazoan genes gained via horizontal gene 
647 
transfer [HGT]) [107], the latter of which are unusually frequent in bdelloid genomes 
648 
[44,46,108–110]. Thus, it may be the case that bdelloids have an enhanced RNAi system to 
649 
defend against invasion from horizontally transferred TEs, particularly if the level of exposure or 
650 
rate of import is higher relative to other animals. Furthermore, the ability of some RNAi 
651 
pathways to distinguish self from non-self may be needed to maintain genome integrity over 
652 
longer timescales, if such mechanisms are operating. Further work on the precise functions of the 
653 
divergent Ago and RdRP clades is required to explore these possibilities.

678 
line due to the ancient genome duplication in all bdelloids, such that many genes are found in double

686 
Conclusions 
687 
 
688 
We show that all bdelloids encode a rich diversity of TEs from both class I (retroelements) and 
689 
class II (DNA transposons), and thus reject the idea that bdelloids are deficient or unusual in 
690 
their TE content or diversity. Moreover, a substantial fraction of these elements has been active 
691 
relatively recently within populations. This finding is at odds with the original predictions of 
692 
population genetic theory for TEs in asexuals. One possible resolution is that theory is missing 
693 
some component or assumption. It is possible that parameter space exists that permits 
694 
intermediate levels of TEs in an asexual population, perhaps sustained by high rates of horizontal 
695 
transfer, which there is evidence for in bdelloids. The HGT idea has some support from the 
696 
increased prevalence of class II DNA transposons in bdelloids, given their greater propensity for 
697 
horizontal transfer, but we found that the basally divergent lineage leading to D. carnosus had a 
698 
profile more like the monogonont rotifers with regard to non-LTR retrotransposon abundance, 
699 
despite sharing other features with the rest of bdelloids. Alternatively, some TEs might have 
700 
been co-opted to provide beneficial functions, which is hypothesised to explain the unusually 
701 
large and complex Terminon repeats. Other TEs may have evolved strong site-specificity to 
702 
neutral genome regions to mitigate negative effects of transposition. This idea is supported by 
703 
the preference shown for insertions into gene-poor regions that are probably at or near the 
704 
telomeres, although it seems unlikely that the full complement of bdelloid TEs have accumulated 
705 
in this way. 
706 
 
707 
We also ask what forces may be acting to suppress TE activity in bdelloid populations. A major 
708 
finding is that an abundance and diversity of RNAi gene silencing pathways, characterised by a 
709 
large expansion of Argonaute and RdRP genes, appears to be a unique feature of bdelloid 
710 
genomes. The precise origins and functions of these divergent Ago and RdRP clades are yet to 
711 
be elucidated, but it seems likely that such an extended arsenal of TE defence genes offers 
712 
enhanced protection against the deleterious effects of TE activity, particularly if bdelloid 
713 
populations cannot keep TEs in check through sexual processes but are still exposed to new 
714 
invasions via HGT. This enhanced RNAi system may then provide a more deterministic action 
715 
against TEs, as opposed to stochastic forces (such as genetic drift) that may predominate in other 
716 
animal groups and may potentially explain the greater uniformity of TE proportions in bdelloids 
717 
relative to monogononts. 
718 
 
719 
An alternative resolution is that the assumption of no recombination and strict clonality is not 
720 
met in bdelloids. Previous work, for example, proposed that intra-individual recombination 
721 
during the repair of DSBs caused by desiccation could provide a mechanism to keep TE numbers 
722 
in check. We found no evidence here that overall TE loads were lower in desiccating species 
723 
than nondesiccating species, a finding not limited to bdelloids, or for differences in activity or 
724 
rate of turnover between them. It remains possible that an equivalent mechanism, such as mitotic 
725 
recombination, or unusual DNA repair mechanisms operating in nondesiccating species as well, 
726 
could still act to limit TE proliferation and facilitate elimination of inserted copies, maintaining 
727

an equilibrium between TE spread and removal by excision and selection. Finally, there could be 
728 
some hidden mechanism of inter-individual recombination that facilitates TE removal. We found 
729 
no evidence for its action here, but further work is needed for a final answer on the conundrum 
730 
of bdelloid asexuality.

Rotifer sampling and culture. For most samples, individual rotifers were collected from 
736 
permanent and temporary freshwater habitats around Imperial College London’s Silwood Park 
737 
campus, Ascot, UK between May 2015 and February 2019. Three samples (R. magnacalcarata 
738 
RM9 and RM15, and R. socialis RS1) were collected from a freshwater spring in Fontaneto 
739 
d’Agogna, Italy in 2016 (see S1 Data for details). Although we focused on the genera Adineta 
740 
and Rotaria, we also included two individuals from the desiccation-tolerant species 
741 
Didymodactylos carnosus. Preliminary phylogenetic data had identified this as a distant outgroup 
742 
to the focal genera, useful in rooting phylogenetic trees and as a further independent datapoint to 
743 
test the generality of conclusions about bdelloids. A total of 26 samples were submitted for 
744 
single-individual, whole genome sequencing; for these, DNA was extracted using either a Chelex 
745 
preparation (Bio-Rad InstaGene Matrix) or a QIAamp DNA Micro Kit (Qiagen), and whole-
746 
genome amplified using a REPLI-g Single Cell kit (Qiagen) before sequencing on either 
747 
Illumina NextSeq500 at the Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge (Cambridge, 
748 
UK), or Illumina HiSeq X at Edinburgh Genomics, University of Edinburgh (Edinburgh, UK). 
749 
For A. ricciae ARIC003, DNA was extracted from ~200 animals descended from a single 
750 
individual before whole-genome amplification. For B. calyciflorus PSC1, individuals for DNA 
751 
extractions were derived from an individual isolate from a laboratory stock population previously 
752 
isolated from field-collected resting eggs [111]. DNA was extracted from ~5000 starved 
753 
individuals using a phenol-chloroform protocol and sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq500 at 
754 
the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology. Three 10x Genomics Chromium ‘linked 
755 
reads’ libraries were generated for A. steineri, Rotaria sp. ‘Silwood-1’ and R. sordida; for these, 
756 
high molecular weight DNA was extracted from thousands of animals reared clonally from a 
757 
single wild-caught animal, without whole-genome amplification, using the Chromium 
758 
Demonstrated Protocol “HMW gDNA Extraction from Single Insects” 
759 
(https://support.10xgenomics.com/permalink/7HBJeZucc80CwkMAmA4oQ2). Linked-read 
760 
libraries were constructed at the Centre for Genomics Research, Liverpool, UK, before 
761 
sequencing on the HiSeq X at Edinburgh Genomics. Further details on rotifer sampling, DNA 
762 
extraction and sequencing are provided in S1 Data. 
763 
 
764 
Biological replicates. To check the repeatability of the whole-genome amplification (WGA), 
765 
sequencing, assembly and analysis pipelines, we included several samples that were either 
766 
biological replicates of the same rotifer clone, or where high-quality genomes were available for 
767 
the same clone from unamplified source material. Specifically, for Rotaria sp. ‘Silwood-2’ we 
768 
isolated two consecutive offspring from the same wild-caught mother and conducted WGA, 
769 
sequencing, assembly and analysis for these sisters independently (as Rp_RPSE411 and 
770 
Rp_RPSE503). From the same clonal laboratory line of Rotaria sp. ‘Silwood-1’ that was used 
771 
for 10x Genomics DNA preparation, we isolated two more individuals and processed each 
772 
independently using the WGA workflow (as Rw_RSIL801 and Rw_RSIL802). Finally, we 
773 
applied the WGA method to DNA from A. ricciae, for which a previous assembly was available 
774 
from unamplified DNA [46] on the same clonal culture and included this replicate in 
775 
downstream analyses alongside the earlier reference assembly.

Data filtering and genome assembly. We generated two assembly versions for each of the 
778 
single-individual rotifer samples. The ‘reference’ assemblies were scaffolded and polished to 
779 
result in haploid assemblies with improved contiguity. The ‘maximum haplotig’ (‘maxhap’) 
780 
assemblies instead retained highly similar contigs that might otherwise be removed during 
781 
assembly polishing. Our pipeline is outlined as follows. 
782 
 
783 
For the Illumina libraries, raw sequence data were filtered for low quality bases and adapter 
784 
sequence using BBTools v38.73 ‘bbduk’ (https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/), and error 
785 
corrected using BBTools ‘tadpole’. Data quality was inspected manually using FastQC v0.11.5 
786 
[112] aided by MultiQC [113] visualisation. For the A. steineri, R. sp. ‘Silwood-1’ and R. 
787 
sordida linked-read libraries, data were assembled into haploid (‘pseudohap’) and diploid 
788 
(‘megabubbles’) genome representations using the 10x Genomics proprietary software 
789 
Supernova v2.1.1 [114] and further scaffolded with ARKS v1.0.4 [115]. All raw sequencing data 
790 
are deposited in the relevant International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) 
791 
databases under the Study ID PRJEB39843 (see S1 Data for run accessions and counts for raw 
792 
and filtered data). 
793 
 
794 
For the single-individual samples, an initial assembly was generated using SPAdes v3.13.0 [116] 
795 
with default settings. Contaminating reads from non–target organisms, identified based on 
796 
aberrant GC content, read coverage and/or taxonomic annotation, were then identified and 
797 
removed using BlobTools v1.1.1 [117,118]. For R. magnacalcarata and R. socialis samples, 
798 
resultant haplotigs were then collapsed using Redundans [119] with default settings before 
799 
scaffolding and gap filling with SSPACE v3.0 and GapCloser v1.12 respectively [120,121]. For 
800 
A. steineri, R. sp. ‘Silwood-1’ and R. sordida single-individual samples, the scaffolding step was 
801 
performed with RaGOO v1.1 [122,123], using the matching 10x Genomics ‘pseudohap’ 
802 
assembly as a reference (contigs from R. sp. ‘Silwood-2’ were scaffolded using the R. sp. 
803 
‘Silwood-1’ 10x reference), specifying the ‘-C’ parameter to prevent concatenation of unaligned 
804 
contigs. Scaffolded assemblies were subjected to further rounds of BlobTools to remove any 
805 
additional sequences derived from non-target organisms. These assemblies were designated the

For the maxhap assemblies, filtered fastq files were first generated by mapping the original 
809 
(trimmed and error-corrected) sequencing reads to each reference genome, using the 
810 
‘outm=filtered_R#.fq’ functionality of BBTools ‘bbmap’, and then reassembled with SPAdes, 
811 
increasing the final kmer value to 121. Assembly metrics were summarised using ‘calN50.js’ 
812 
(https://github.com/lh3/calN50), which reports the ‘expected scaffold size’ (AU) as an alternative 
813 
metric of assembly contiguity that is less biased than N50 (defined as the area under the 
814 
cumulative genome span versus contig length graph, equivalent to the expected scaffold size for 
815 
a randomly chosen assembly location [124]). Gene-completeness scores for core eukaryotic (n = 
816 
303) and metazoan (n = 978) genes were calculated for all assemblies using BUSCO v3.0.2 
817 
[125] with default settings. Reference and maxhap assemblies for B. calyciflorus PSC1 and D. 
818 
carnosus are the same, due to a lack of appropriate data for scaffolding.  
819 
 
820 
Gene prediction. Gene prediction was performed on reference assemblies using one of three 
821 
approaches, depending on the availability of RNA-seq data. For B. calyciflorus, A. ricciae, and 
822 
all R. magnacalcarata, R. socialis, and R. sordida assemblies, published RNA-seq data 
823 
[109,110,126] were downloaded from NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA), quality-trimmed 
824 
using BBTools ‘bbduk’ with default settings and aligned to the genomic scaffolds using STAR 
825 
v2.7.3a [127] with the option ‘--twoPassMode Basic’. Aligned BAM files were then provided to 
826 
BRAKER v2.1.2 [128–132] with default settings for gene prediction. For A. steineri, R. sp.

‘Silwood-1’ and R. sp. ‘Silwood-2’ assemblies, RNA-seq data from a related species (A. ricciae 
828 
and R. magnacalcarata respectively) were used instead, aligned using BBTools ‘bbmap’ with the 
829 
options ‘maxindel=200k minid=0.5’, before gene prediction with BRAKER as above. Finally, 
830 
for the distantly related D. carnosus, BRAKER was run using gene-model parameters estimated 
831 
from BUSCO analysis of the genomic scaffolds. The quality of predicted proteins was assessed 
832 
using BUSCO in protein mode. Intragenomic divergence between homologous gene copies and 
833 
collinearity was calculated as for Nowell et al. (2018) and described in S1 Note. Genome 
834 
assemblies and gene predictions were converted to EMBL format using EMBLmyGFF3 v2 
835 
[133], and are deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the Study ID PRJEB39843 (see Table 1 
836 
and S1 Table for individual GenBank accessions).

Rotifer phylogeny. Evolutionary relationships among new genomes and published genomes of 
839 
rotifers were determined using a core-genome phylogenomics approach based on the BUSCO 
840 
eukaryotic gene set. For genomes from species with very high intragenomic homologous 
841 
divergence (A. ricciae and A. vaga), redundancy was removed by selecting the copy with the 
842 
highest BUSCO score for all BUSCO genes with multiple copies, using the script 
843 
BUSCO_collapse_multicopy.pl’ (https://github.com/reubwn/scripts). One-to-one co-orthologs 
844 
found in at least 95% of the samples were then identified using the script 
845 
‘BUSCO_phylogenomics.py’ (https://github.com/jamiemcg/BUSCO_phylogenomics). Protein 
846 
sequences were aligned using Clustalo [134] and concatenated in Geneious R9 [135]. The full 
847 
alignment was checked by eye and sections with ambiguous alignment within the bdelloid clade 
848 
were removed across all sequences to avoid aligning potential paralogs or homoeologs. 
849 
Translation errors arising from annotation issues in specific bdelloid genomes were identified by 
850 
obvious mismatches to the consensus of closely related genomes, and the affected residues were 
851 
deleted in the affected genome only. Potential alignment issues within the monogonont clade 
852 
were less obvious owing to the substantial genetic divergence from bdelloids and the smaller 
853 
number of genomes and replicates, so corrections were less stringent. A maximum-likelihood 
854 
phylogeny was then estimated using IQ-TREE v1.6.12, with automatic model selection 
855 
(VT+F+I+G4) [136,137]. Branching support was assessed using SH-aLRT and ultrafast 
856 
bootstrap sampling (‘-alrt 1000 -bb 5000’) [138,139]. 
857 
 
858 
Repeat annotation and TE dynamics. TEs and other repeats were identified using the 
859 
RepeatModeler and RepeatMasker pipelines. For each sample, a de novo repeat library was 
860 
generated directly from the assembled nucleotides using RepeatModeler2 [140] and combined 
861 
with a database of 12,662 protostome repeats from Repbase v23.08 [141] and 278 additional TEs 
862 
manually curated from the A. vaga genome [44]. Repeats and TEs were then detected and 
863 
classified using RepeatMasker v4.1.0 [84], and resultant outputs were post-processed using the 
864 
‘One code to find them all’ Perl script [142]. The breakdown of TE superfamilies in the final 
865 
database was 4,145 DNA transposons (including 300 rolling circles), 5,523 LTRs, 2,583 LINEs 
866 
(including SINEs), 227 PLEs, and 165 simple or low-complexity repeats. TE content (expressed 
867 
as a proportion of genome size) was mapped onto the phylogeny using ‘contMap’ in the Phytools 
868 
v0.6-99 package in R v3.6.0 [143,144]. There is no module for the detection of class II MITEs in 
869 
RepeatMasker; for these, the separate program Generic Repeat Finder (GRF) was run using 
870 
default parameters. TE dynamics were investigated by constructing Kimura 2-parameter 
871 
divergence [85] landscapes using the utility scripts in the RepeatMasker package and plotted 
872 
using custom scripts (see below). Selected assemblies were also submitted to the REPET v2.5 
873 
‘TEdenovo’ [145,146] TE detection and annotation pipeline with default parameters, for 
874 
comparison. In addition, for D. carnosus and R. sordida (using 10x Genomics) reference 
875 
assemblies, we increased the parameter ‘minNbSeqPerGroup’ from 3 to 5 to evaluate 
876 
contribution from tetraploid genes, which was judged to be negligible. Although

881 
The presence or absence of specific LTR retrotransposon (LTR-R) insertions in our population 
882 
data was inferred using a read-mapping approach. Specifically, the presence of a given insertion 
883 
was scored based on the alignment score of the ‘best’ read that mapped continuously and 
884 
contiguously across the LTR-genome boundary. First, full-length LTR-Rs (i.e. those with 
885 
annotated 5’ and 3’ LTR regions) were identified from each reference assembly using 
886 
LTR_retriever v2.8 [148]. Three filters were then applied to remove false positives. Candidates 
887 
that showed an overlap with a predicted gene in the 5’ or 3’ LTR itself or an ‘N’ base within 150 
888 
bases upstream or downstream of its genomic location that might indicate local mis-assembly 
889 
were removed. Candidates also required supporting evidence of LTR homology from a separate 
890 
RepeatMasker annotation of the reference assembly. For each remaining LTR-R, a library of 
891 
‘LTR-tags’ was then generated by extracting a 100 bp sequence that spanned 50 bases into the 
892 
genomic (i.e., non-TE) region of the insertion site from both the 5’ and 3’ terminal repeated 
893 
regions. Thus, each pair of ‘LTR-tags’ represents an insertion of a particular LTR into a specific 
894 
location in the focal genome, and a score is calculated based on the alignment information 
895 
contained in the CIGAR string of the ‘best’ read (i.e. with the highest number of alignment 
896 
matches) from the SAM mapping file: Si = ((MLi − XLi ) + (MRi − XRi ))/200, where MLi is the 
897 
number of alignment matches for the left-hand tag for LTR i, penalised by the number of 
898 
mismatches XLi, with equivalent scoring for the right-hand tag. Since tag length is 100 bases, the 
899 
maximum score for a perfect alignment is 200, or 1 after normalisation. The number of mapped 
900 
reads is also recorded to provide an estimate of coverage (but note that Si is taken from the best 
901 
read only). Sequencing reads from all single-individual rotifer samples were aligned to the 
902 
filtered LTR-tag set using BBTools ‘bbmap’ with the parameters ‘minid=0.5 local=t’ and scored 
903 
using the above system. Because orthologous LTR-Rs may be identified from searches started in 
904 
different genomes, we identified these cases by reconstructing the phylogeny of the LTR-tags 
905 
and any with pairwise sequence divergence less than 0.1 were collapsed to yield a condensed 
906 
final matrix. 
907 
 
908 
The LTR-tag case-study in Fig. 4b was selected for closer investigation in the draft assemblies 
909 
after consideration of several examples, because it illustrates variability for an element insertion 
910 
site within a species and indicates that Class I TEs can insert in coding regions, with potential 
911 
fitness consequences. The LTR-tags were mapped to the RM15 draft assembly using Geneious 
912 
Prime v2020.1.2 [135], and were found to match an element annotated by LTR_retriever, 
913 
containing four predicted genes. In the RM9 draft assembly, only the left-hand tag was mapped, 
914 
as the scaffold ended before the inserted element was fully assembled. For the same reason, the 
915 
element in RM9 had not been annotated as such by LTR_retriever, but the sequence is nearly 
916 
identical (99.7%) to the insertion in RM15 along its aligned length (except that the annotations 
917 
predicted three element-associated genes rather than four). The scaffolds were trimmed to the 
918 
focal gene and aligned, and the region was used as a BLASTn query against local databases for 
919 
two other R. magnacalcarata reference genomes where the LTR-tag was absent: MAG1 and 
920 
Rg2018. In each case, this provided the location of a closely similar but uninterrupted copy of 
921 
the focal gene, although the annotations of the gene’s structure differed slightly among genomes. 
922 
These scaffolds were trimmed and aligned against the copies from RM9 and RM15, using the 
923 
Geneious alignment tool with default settings, except that the gap extension penalty was reduced 
924 
from 3 to 0.2 to enable the algorithm to handle the element insertion. Local features were 
925 
manually reannotated to illustrate the interpretation provided in the text. To investigate the 
926 
potential function of the interrupted gene, the copy from MAG1 (g37061) was translated and 
927

used as a BLASTp query against the NCBI RefSeq Protein Database [149]. A region of 
928 
approximately 1000 residues was found to have weak similarity (~25% pairwise identity) to 
929 
proteins annotated as midasins, from a range of eukaryotes. As a final step, the intact gene from 
930 
MAG1 was used as a BLASTn query against the full draft genomes of RM9 and RM15, which 
931 
revealed a separate scaffold in each case, containing a partial copy of the gene in which the 
932 
coding sequence was intact across the junction spanned by the LTR-tag, and the element 
933 
insertion was absent.

Recombination analyses. We tested sexual versus clonal patterns of variation in LTR presence 
936 
and absences. First, we calculated consistency indices (CI) with parsimony reconstruction of the 
937 
binary matrix. LTR-tags with scores > 0.875 were coded as present (i.e. no more than half of the 
938 
genome context or LTR region from both left and right LTR-tags was missing) and < 0.875 
939 
coded as absent (alternative thresholds led to the same qualitative results). A CI = 1 indicates 
940 
perfect nesting with no homoplasy, whereas a score less than 1 is expected if variation is shuffled 
941 
among loci and not tree-like. Next, we calculated the index of association and ran permutations 
942 
to test for significant linkage disequilibrium of the LTR-tag data relative to a null model of 
943 
random shuffling (expected in a fully outcrossing sexual population). We used the modified 
944 
index of association by Agapow and Burt (2001) [150] that corrects for an effect of the number 
945 
of loci on the index, and ran permutations using the ‘ia’ function in the Poppr v2.8.5 library 
946 
[151] in R. Data were coded as diploid and codominant presence/absence data (because of the 
947 
lack of diploid assemblies in the population-level data). Finally, for R. magnacalcarata and R. 
948 
socialis we ran simulations with the FacSexCoalescent simulator of Hartfield et al. (2018) [152] 
949 
to generate 50000 datasets with the same number of individuals and sampled binary loci as 
950 
observed, but with frequencies of sexual versus asexual reproduction within the populations 
951 
varying from 10-7 (i.e. negligible) to 1 (i.e. obligate sexual). We estimate the posterior 
952 
distribution of the frequency of sex for our observed samples using Approximate Bayesian 
953 
Computation on the simulated datasets implemented in the abc package in R.

Reverse transcriptase survey. A hidden Markov model (HMM) approach was used to survey 
956 
the predicted rotifer proteomes for proteins encoding the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain 
957 
(Pfam ID PF00078). First, a HMM was constructed from an alignment of 51 RT domains from 
958 
across the tree of life [57], supplemented with 67 bdelloid-specific retroelements 
959 
[44,57,58,61,63,64] (S9 Fig). Alternative transcripts were first removed from predicted 
960 
proteomes and proteins with a significant match (E-value ≤ 1e−5) were identified and inserted 
961 
into the core RT alignment using HMMER v3.2.1 ‘hmmsearch’ and ‘hmmalign’, respectively 
962 
(http://hmmer.org/). Maximum likelihood phylogenies were then constructed using IQ-TREE as 
963 
above, specifying the root of the phylogeny to be on the branch leading to the bacterial retrons 
964 
[57]. Trees were manipulated using FigTree v1.4.4 (https://github.com/rambaut/figtree), 
965 
colouring the identified RT-encoding rotifer proteins based on their phylogenetic position. The 
966 
span accounted for by genome ‘features’ (other genes, other TEs and telomeric repeats) in a 25 
967 
kb window around each identified RT-containing protein was summarised using BEDTools 
968 
v2.29.2 ‘intersect’ and ‘groupby’ [153]. Other genes were counted as predicted coding regions 
969 
that did not overlap with any TE annotation. Genomic locations of the telomeric hexamer 
970 
‘TGTGGG’ [58] were identified using EMBOSS ‘fuzznuc’ [154], excluding any hexamer that 
971 
overlapped with a predicted CDS. Note that the telomeric repeat for Brachionus is not known, 
972 
but the sequence above was among the most frequent G-rich hexamers identified in the PSC1 
973 
genome (see S2 Note).

980 
based on the presence of the RdRP domain (PF05183). Stockholm files were downloaded from

(UP000276133), Branchiostoma floridae (UP000001554) and Homo sapiens UP000005640.

Proteins were aligned using either ‘hmmalign’ from the HMMER package or Clustalo, and ML 
991 
phylogenies were constructed using IQ-TREE as above.  
992 
 
993 
Comparative protein–domain abundance plots were constructed using counts of Pfam entries 
994 
parsed directly from InterProScan5 [156] annotation of predicted proteomes. The ‘abundance 
995 
score’ was computed as the (log) ratio of domain counts in bdelloids divided by the domain 
996 
counts in eukaryotes, corrected for inflation in bdelloids due to the ancient whole-genome 
997 
duplication by dividing the former by two. This correction is likely to be conservative, since 
998 
many loci have lost one branch of the ancient duplication (i.e. tetraploidy is degenerate). To 
999 
check that the putative RdRP expansion was indeed eukaryotic in origin, rather than viral, the 
1000 
HMMs for four viral RdRP families (PF00680, PF00978, PF00998 and PF02123) were 
1001 
downloaded from Pfam and submitted to the same search protocol, with zero hits to bdelloid 
1002 
proteomes recorded.

Statistical analyses. To assess differences in TE content between desiccating and non-
1005 
desiccating rotifer species, we ran Bayesian linear mixed-effects models of TE content (as a 
1006 
percentage of genome span) including desiccation as a two-level fixed factor and sample ID as a 
1007 
random intercept term. The BUSCO gene phylogeny was used to account for non-independence 
1008 
among species. A separate model was run for each TE superfamily (including ‘unclassified’ TEs) 
1009 
as well as for all TEs combined. Inverse-Wishart priors were used for the random and residual 
1010 
variances, and models were run for 42,0000 iterations with a burn-in of 20,000 and a thinning 
1011 
interval of 200. This resulted in 2,000 stored samples of the posterior with minimal 
1012 
autocorrelation in all cases (< 0.2) [157]. Models were run using the MCMCglmm v2.29 [158] 
1013 
package in R. The phylogenetic signal, defined as the proportion of the total variance in TE 
1014 
content attributable to the phylogeny [159], was estimated from the MCMCglmm model output 
1015 
using the formula: λ = σP2/(σP2 + σR2). 
1016 
 
1017 
The density of genomic features surrounding BUSCO genes versus RT-containing genes were 
1018 
compared using linear mixed effects models with species as a random effect and gene class 
1019 
(BUSCO, PLE, LINE or LTR) as a fixed effect, run using lme4 [160] v1.1-21 in R. TE length 
1020 
distributions were compared using the same approach, with species as a random effect and 
1021 
binary factors specifying monogononts versus bdelloid, and desiccating versus nondesiccating 
1022 
species.
