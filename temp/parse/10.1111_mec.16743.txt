Abstract
Of the estimated 55 Hawaiian honeycreepers (subfamily Carduelinae) only 17 spe-
cies remain, nine of which the International Union for Conservation of Nature consid-
ers endangered. Among the most pressing threats to honeycreeper survival is avian 
malaria, caused by the introduced blood parasite Plasmodium relictum, which is in-
creasing in distribution in Hawaiʻi as a result of climate change. Preventing further 
honeycreeper decline will require innovative conservation strategies that confront 
malaria from multiple angles. Research on mammals has revealed strong connections 
between gut microbiome composition and malaria susceptibility, illuminating a po-
tential novel approach to malaria control through the manipulation of gut microbiota. 
One honeycreeper species, Hawaiʻi ʻamakihi (Chlorodrepanis virens), persists in areas 
of high malaria prevalence, indicating they have acquired some level of immunity. To 
investigate if avian host-­specific microbes may be associated with malaria survival, 
we characterized cloacal microbiomes and malaria infection for 174 ʻamakihi and 
172 malaria-­resistant warbling white-­eyes (Zosterops japonicus) from Hawaiʻi Island 
using 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. 
Neither microbial alpha nor beta diversity covaried with infection, but 149 microbes 
showed positive associations with malaria survivors. Among these were Escherichia 
and Lactobacillus spp., which appear to mitigate malaria severity in mammalian hosts, 
revealing promising candidates for future probiotic research for augmenting malaria 
immunity in sensitive endangered species.

1  |  INTRODUCTION
Anthropogenically introduced diseases to naïve ecosystems have 
been responsible for myriad local extinction events in wildlife 
populations and pose major concerns for the conservation of bio-
diversity worldwide (Rogalski et al., 2017). Increasing evidence in-
dicates that microbiomes, the microbial communities residing on 
or within organisms, have strong influence over host health and 
fitness (Suzuki,  2017), and can shape various ecological and evo-
lutionary processes such as host–­parasite interactions (Waide & 
Schmidt,  2020), and disease susceptibility or severity (Broom & 
Kogut,  2018). Microbiome research is rapidly advancing with the 
improvement of sequencing capabilities such as 16S ribosomal RNA 
gene (16S rRNA) sequencing for bacterial identification, allowing for 
the analysis of microbial community composition from a wide range 
of sources, including faecal, anal or cloacal swab samples that can be 
collected from wild animal populations. With the recent surge in an-
imal microbiome data and as the importance of microbiomes to host 
health comes to light, there has been a call to incorporate results 
from studies of microbiota into conservation planning (Trevelline 
et al., 2019).
Island species can be particularly susceptible to introduced dis-
eases, as they often lack the immunological adaptations that their 
mainland counterparts have evolved through historical exposure 
to pathogens (van Riper et al., 1986; Warner, 1968). Such species 
may benefit greatly from conservation strategies that manipulate 
microbiota to manage disease risks. Hawaiian honeycreepers (sub-
family Carduelinae) have suffered devastating losses due to the 
introduction of Plasmodium relictum, a blood parasite that causes 
avian malaria (van Riper et al., 1986; Warner, 1968) which is effec-
tively vectored by the non-­native mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus 
(Fonseca et al., 2000). The substantial mortality of Hawaiian hon-
eycreepers to avian malaria makes this group of native forest birds 
a prime example of an island taxon that may benefit from host-­
microbiome disease research. Of the 55 honeycreeper species that 
have been documented across the Hawaiian archipelago (Lerner 
et al., 2011; Pratt et al., 2009), only 17 remain, nine of which are 
considered endangered by the International Union for Conservation 
of Nature (IUCN, 2022). Most of the extant honeycreeper species 
can only persist in high-­elevation forest refugia, where mosquito 
population dispersal and malarial sporozoite (the infectious life 
stage of P. relictum) development are limited by lower temperatures 
(LaPointe et al., 2010). As global temperatures rise due to climate 
change, avian malaria is expected to continue expanding into higher 
elevations, probably leading to multiple extinctions in the coming 
decades without intervention (Paxton et al., 2016, 2018). Protecting 
Hawaiian avifauna from extinction will require conservation strat-
egies that combat avian malaria at multiple stages, including con-
trolling the distribution of its mosquito vector, and facilitating 
honeycreeper persistence in environments with increased malaria 
prevalence (Paxton et al., 2018).
Recent experiments with mice have revealed strong connec-
tions between gut microbiome composition and malaria parasite 
resistance and disease severity. Mice that are genetically similar 
but differ in their gut bacterial communities have been shown to 
differ significantly in their parasite susceptibility, parasite burden 
and mortality rates after exposure to Plasmodium spp. (Martinez-­
Gómez et al., 2006; Morffy Smith et al., 2019; Stough et al., 2016; 
Villarino et al.,  2016; Yilmaz et al.,  2014). Additionally, caecal 
content transplants from the guts of mice that displayed malaria 
resistance to mice with sterilized guts resulted in less severe infec-
tion in the recipient mice than in those that received transplants 
from malaria-­susceptible mice (Morffy Smith et al., 2019; Villarino 
et al.,  2016). These encouraging relationships between malaria 
and the microbiome illuminate a novel approach to conservation 
of species sensitive to malaria infection, namely the development 
of antimalarial probiotics. However, although the link between the 
gut microbiome and malaria immunity has been established for 
mice in a laboratory setting, little is known about the potential con-
nection in other species or in natural environments (but see Lutz 
et al., 2021; Palinauskas et al., 2022; Videvall, Marzal, et al., 2021). 
Further, extrapolating insights gained from mammalian studies to 
avian systems may be challenging or inappropriate as current re-
search indicates bird–­microbe symbiosis dynamics are distinct from 
those of other vertebrates (Bodawatta et al., 2022). Nonetheless, 
the possibility of such relationships warrants further investigation.
In the present study, we used quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction (qPCR) to determine malaria infection status and 16S 
rRNA gene sequencing to characterize cloacal microbiomes of 
wild Hawaiʻi ʻamakihi (Chlorodrepanis virens) and warbling white-­
eyes (Zosterops japonicus), sampled across Hawaiʻi Island. The 
nonendangered Hawaiʻi ʻamakihi is one of only two honeycreeper 
species that persists at high and low elevations throughout its 
historical range, including some areas of high malaria prevalence 
(Camp,  2019; Woodworth et al.,  2005). ʻAmakihi display differ-
ential mortality rates from avian malaria infection across an el-
evational gradient, with low-­elevation populations experiencing 
17% mortality compared to 60% in high-­elevation populations, 
indicating increased disease pressure at lower elevations is select-
ing for the evolution of immune strategies in these populations 
(Atkinson et al., 2013). Regardless, ʻamakihi, like all honeycreep-
ers, are highly susceptible to infection with avian malaria, and 
individuals that survive infection maintain chronic low levels of 
the parasite in their blood following exposure, even after all dis-
ease symptoms have resolved (Atkinson et al., 2001). In contrast, 
warbling white-­eyes, like other bird species with evolutionary 
histories of exposure to avian malaria, probably are able to clear 
circulating parasites from their blood in most instances (Cellier-­
Holzem et al., 2010). Warbling white-­eyes, which were introduced 
to Hawaiʻi in the 1920s (Guest, 1973), suffer little to no mortal-
ity from malaria infection (van Riper et al.,  1986), but serve as 
important reservoirs for malaria in Hawaiian forests (McClure 
et al., 2020), and probably retain a suite of immunological strate-
gies against malaria, to which they are exposed in their historical 
range. One such strategy may be harbouring a microbiome that 
can confer resistance or tolerance to malarial parasites.

NAVINE et al.
In this study, we included both ʻamakihi and warbling white-­
eyes as these two species are ecologically similar and sympatric 
but differ in their resistance to malaria. White-­eyes are abundant 
in all ʻamakihi habitats (McClure et al., 2020), and both species have 
a similar generalist diet, foraging mainly on nectar, arthropods and 
fruit (Mountainspring & Scott,  1985). Microbiomes of individu-
als are shaped by multiple factors, such as host taxonomy (Hird 
et al., 2015), geographical location (Klomp et al., 2008) and diet 
(Bodawatta et al., 2021; Bragg et al., 2020; Hammons et al., 2010), 
and therefore contrasting the microbiomes of these two species 
with similar habitat and diet allows us to differentiate environmen-
tal effects from variation in microbiome diversity associated with 
malaria infection. Our goal was to identify microbes that might 
be associated with avian malaria infection levels and host sur-
vival by contrasting within and between species and across sites. 
Specifically, we (i) examined if cloacal microbiome alpha diversity 
(within sample variation) or beta diversity (between sample varia-
tion) covaries with P. relictum infection, and (ii) evaluated whether 
specific bacterial taxa within the cloacal microbiome were associ-
ated with malaria survival by comparing uninfected and infected 
ʻamakihi and white-­eyes. These questions have potentially signif-
icant conservation implications as elucidating a relationship be-
tween the microbiome and malaria induced mortality in Hawaiian 
honeycreepers is an essential first step in assessing the feasibility 
of mitigating the honeycreeper extinction crisis through the ma-
nipulation of gut microbiota.
2  |  MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1  |  Study sites and sample collection
Hawaiʻi ʻamakihi (N  =  174) and warbling white-­eye (N  =  172) 
samples were collected from 16 locations and grouped into six 
regions across Hawaiʻi Island (Figure  1) based on geographi-
cal proximity. To assess parasitaemia levels and cloacal mi-
crobiomes of focal species, blood from the brachial wing vein 
and cloacal swab samples were collected from birds passively 
captured in mist-­nets between February and July in 2019 and 
2020. This time period encompasses the peak breeding sea-
son of most Hawaiian forest birds and in the aseasonal climate 
of Hawaiʻi coincides with peak flowering and fruit availability 
(Wolfe et al., 2017). Moreover, this sampling window does not 
overlap with peak malaria transmission, which occurs in autumn 
(Atkinson & Samuel,  2010), when we would be more likely to 
sample individuals undergoing active infections. Blood sam-
ples were stored in Queen's lysis buffer and cloacal swabs were 
stored dry in 2-­ml tubes at −20°C. In a few instances a bird was 
recaptured and resampled in subsequent banding efforts, but 
after all sequence filtering steps were complete only one sample 
remained for each of these birds, and therefore only one sample 
per bird was used in analysis.
2.2  |  Determining malaria infection status
DNA was extracted from blood samples using the Qiagen DNeasy 
Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's proto-
col at the Pathogen and Microbiome Institute at Northern Arizona 
University. Samples were then evaluated for Plasmodium relictum 
(genetic lineage GRW4) parasitaemia via a qPCR assay with a hydrol-
ysis probe (Videvall, Paxton, et al., 2021) and adapted from primers 
targeting the cytochrome B region (Zehtindjiev et al., 2008). Each 
sample was tested in duplicate and threshold cycle (Ct) values were 
averaged between the two runs (Paxton,  2022). Samples with an 
average Ct value greater than 38 were classified as uninfected be-
cause repeatability of P. relictum detection decreased substantially 
after cycle 38 (Navine et al., 2022a). Relative P. relictum parasitae-
mia intensity was calculated using the formula 1/(2[avgCt-­25]). Bird 
species with evolutionary histories of exposure to Plasmodium spp. 
may be able to clear circulating parasites to levels undetectable by 
qPCR (Cellier-­Holzem et al., 2010). Thus, uninfected white-­eyes in 
our study could comprise individuals either naïve to P. relictum expo-
sure or survivors of an infection prior to capture, whereas infected 
white-­eyes were probably recently exposed individuals. In contrast, 
ʻamakihi are unable to clear P. relictum and, if they survive the acute 
phase of malaria, maintain chronic low levels of parasitaemia fol-
lowing exposure (Atkinson et al., 2001). Consequently, uninfected 
ʻamakihi in our study were probably naïve to P. relictum exposure. 
Although a small number of birds with low-­level infections (average 
Ct values >30) may have been in the early phase of acute infection, 
parasitaemia levels climb rapidly in the first few days following inoc-
ulation (Atkinson et al., 2001) and it is unlikely we caught many birds 
in this narrow window. Therefore, birds with low-­level infections 
were assumed to be those that had recovered from infection prior 
to capture. We selected a Ct value of 30 as the cutoff for differen-
tiating between low-­ and high-­level infections based on changes in 
Ct values of experimentally infected ʻamakihi monitored throughout 
infection (Videvall, Paxton, et al., 2021).
2.3  |  Cloacal microbiome amplicon sequencing
We used molecular methods similar to those used in contempo-
rary microbiome studies at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology 
Institute's Center for Conservation Genomics (Bragg et al.,  2020; 
Rao et al., 2020). Briefly, we isolated DNA from the cloacal swabs 
and from negative control swabs using the QIAamp PowerFecal 
Pro DNA Kit, then quantified extracted DNA concentrations 
using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit and Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer 
(Invitrogen). We prepared DNA libraries for 16S rRNA sequenc-
ing at the University of Hawaiʻi at Hilo Core Genetics Facility by 
amplifying the V3–­V5 regions of the 16S rRNA gene, ~570  bp, 
using the 16S Illumina Amplicon Protocol (Illumina) and uni-
versal primers 515F (GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) and 939R 
(CTTGTGCGGGCCCCCGTCAATTC). We then performed index

PCR on the amplicons to attach custom i5 and i7 adaptors that 
provided each cloacal sample a unique sequence barcode identity. 
To remove off-­target sequences, we used the BluePippin protocol 
(Sage Science) trained on a 500–­640-­bp fragment collection for size 
selection. We used Qubit to quantify the final pooled samples and 
prepared 4 nm DNA libraries that were sequenced at the Center for 
Conservation Genomics on a single Illumina MiSeq run using MiSeq 
Reagent Kit version 3 with a 25% PhiX spike (Navine et al., 2022b).
2.4  |  Bioinformatics and statistical analysis
We used fastqc (Andrews, 2010) to quality screen the sequenced 
reads, trimmomatic (version 0.39; Bolger et al.,  2014) to remove 
primer sequences, and dada2 (version 2020.11; Callahan et al., 2016) 
to denoise and quality trim the reads in qiime2 (version 2020.11; 
Bolyen et al.,  2019). Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were 
taxonomically assigned using a naïve Bayes classifier trained on our 
data set using silva (version 138) full-­length reference sequences 
(Quast et al., 2013). Using mafft (Katoh & Standley, 2013) and fast-
tree2 (Price et al.,  2010) we generated a phylogenetic tree of the 
identified ASVs within qiime2. Further processing and all statistical 
analyses were conducted in r (version 4.2.1; R Core Team, 2022). We 
used the r package decontam (version 1.16.0; Davis et al., 2018) to fil-
ter out ASVs identified in the negative control samples. Reads iden-
tified as mitochondrial, chloroplastic or eukaryotic DNA, and reads 
that could not be assigned to the kingdom level, as well as ASVs with 
mean relative abundance <10−5 were filtered from the data set using 
the package phyloseq (version 1.40.0; McMurdie & Holmes, 2013). 
We removed samples that had fewer than 500 reads remaining after 
filtering. Data visualizations were generated using the r package gg-
plot2 (version 3.3.6; Wickham, 2016).
To assess whether cloacal microbiome diversity covaries with 
malaria infection, we assessed both microbial alpha diversity, which

measures within-­sample variation, and beta diversity, which as-
sesses between-­sample variation. We measured alpha diversity 
with integer-­rounded Shannon diversity indices, which account for 
species richness and evenness (Shannon, 1948), using both rarefied 
and nonrarefied reads and found no differences in results. To avoid 
discarding reads unnecessarily, we proceeded with analyses using 
nonrarefied reads (McMurdie & Holmes, 2014). We assessed differ-
ences in Shannon diversity indices between host species (ʻamakihi, 
white-­eye) and age (adult, juvenile, unknown), sampling years (2019, 
2020), months (February–­June) and regions (six regions identified in 
Figure 1), malaria infection status (infected, uninfected), and rela-
tive parasitaemia intensity (relative values between 0 and 1) using a 
negative binomial generalized linear model (nbGLM) to account for 
overdispersion in index values with the r package mass (version 7.3-­
557; Venables & Ripley,  2002). Cloacal microbiome beta diversity 
was measured using Bray–­Curtis dissimilarity, which measured the 
differences in ASV abundance and richness between each pair of 
samples (Bray & Curtis, 1957). We analysed Bray–­Curtis dissimilar-
ities with a permutational multivariate analysis of variance model 
(PERMANOVA) using the adonis function from the r package vegan 
(version 2.6-­2; Oksanen et al., 2022), again comparing host species 
and age, sampling year, month and region, malaria infection status, 
and relative parasitaemia intensity.
To identify specific microbes that may be associated with ma-
laria survival, we used phyloseq functions to visualize variation in the 
relative abundances of microbes at the phylum level between years, 
regions, host species and infection statuses. To identify any bacteria 
in ʻamakihi microbiomes positively associated with disease pressure, 
we ran a linear model (LM) for each ASV, using abundance counts 
normalized to each sample's library size against malaria prevalence 
at the site where the sample was collected (Paxton, 2022) while con-
trolling for sampling year and month. The Benjamini–­Hochberg (BH) 
correction was used to adjust p values (p-­adj) for multiple compari-
sons with a significance cutoff of less than a 5% false discovery rate.
We used deseq2 (version 1.36.0; Love et al., 2014) to test for dif-
ferentially abundant ASVs between different groups while controlling 
for sampling year, month and region, again using the BH correction 
to generate p-­adj. We made three specific comparisons. First, we 
compared ʻamakihi with low-­level malaria infection, that is individu-
als that survived acute malaria and are persistently infected, to un-
infected ʻamakihi, which were probably naïve to exposure (Atkinson 
et al., 2001). If certain gut microbes are conferring malaria protection, 
we would expect to find them in greater abundance in the survivors 
than in the naïve birds. Second, we compared uninfected white-­eyes, 
all assumed to be capable of surviving malaria infection (van Riper 
et al., 1986), to uninfected ʻamakihi. Because warbling white-­eyes are 
resistant and able to clear the infection (Cellier-­Holzem et al., 2010), 
we would expect to find a greater number of potentially beneficial 
microbes in warbling white-­eyes than in uninfected ʻamakihi. Among 
the ASVs uncovered in these two comparisons are microbes that pos-
sibly modulate malaria severity, and thus they are all candidates for 
further investigation, particularly ASVs that have been shown to pro-
vide malaria protection in other hosts. Last, we compared uninfected 
white-­eyes to chronically infected ʻamakihi. If gut microbes are part of 
the reason why chronically infected ʻamakihi were able to survive, we 
may expect that the abundance of some of the candidate microbes 
identified in infected ʻamakihi will be similar to the cloacal microbi-
omes of the malaria-­resistant white-­eyes.
To separate microbial communities associated with malaria infec-
tion survival from those experiencing acute disruptions associated 
with the active phase of infection (Ippolito et al., 2018), we excluded 
ʻamakihi with high-­level parasitaemia (average Ct values <30) and all 
infected white-­eyes from the linear models and differential abun-
dance analyses. We assumed that ʻamakihi with low-­level infections 
were likely to have recovered their normal microbial communities at 
the time of capture for two reasons. First, malaria-­induced microbial 
imbalances appear to revert back to baseline within 30 days of infec-
tion in mice (Mooney et al., 2015). Second, in ʻamakihi that survive 
malaria, parasitaemia drops to chronic low levels within 30 days of 
infection (Atkinson et al., 2001, 2013).
3  |  RESULTS
3.1  |  Cloacal microbiome diversity does not covary 
with malaria infection
Of the 346 birds in this study, malaria infection was detected in 49 
ʻamakihi (28%) and 39 white-­eyes (23%; Table S1). Within the infected 
groups, nine ʻamakihi and three white-­eyes had high parasitaemia lev-
els indicative of the acute phase of malaria. The other 40 infected 
ʻamakihi were classified as malaria survivors with persistent low-­level 
parasitaemia. Cloacal microbiome alpha diversity was strongly influ-
enced by sampling year (nbGLM: χ2[1] = 23.22, p < .001; Figure 2b), 
but did not differ between months (χ2[5] = 1.01, p = .962), regions 
(χ2[5] = 4.95, p = .422; Figure 2a), bird species (χ2[1] = 1.37, p = .242; 
Figure 2a–­c), ages of birds (χ2[2] = 1.25, p = .536) or infection sta-
tus (χ2[1] = 0.10, p = .757; Figure 2c), nor did it covary with relative 
parasitaemia intensity (χ2[1] = 0.09, p = .765; Figure S1). The larg-
est amount of variation in cloacal microbiome beta diversity was 
explained by the year the sample was collected (PERMANOVA: 
R2 = .12, F1,330 = 52.24, p = .001; Figure S2b), followed by sampling 
region (R2 = .07, F5,330 = 6.50, p = .001; Figure S2a), sampling month 
(R2 = .04, F5,330 = 3.53, p = .001), bird species (R2 = .02, F1,330 = 7.66, 
p = .001; Figure S2a–­d) and age (R2 = .01, F2,330 = 1.50, p = .038; 
Figure S2d). Beta diversity did not vary between infected and unin-
fected birds (R2 = .00, F1,330 = 1.36, p = .125; Figure S2c), nor did it co-
vary with relative infection intensity (R2 = .00, F1,330 = 0.91, p = .581).
3.2  |  Certain cloacal ASVs differ in abundance 
between host species and between malaria-­
infected and uninfected birds

both ʻamakihi and white-­eyes, the most abundant phyla were

Proteobacteria (69% and 58%, respectively), Firmicutes (7% and 
19%, respectively) and Actinobacteria (9% and 12%, respectively; 
Figure  3; Table  S2). The most abundant genera differed between 
the two host species. The top genera in ʻamakihi microbiomes 
were Pseudomonas (17%), Cutibacterium (4%), Thermomonas (2%) 
and Blastomonas (2%), while the top genera of white-­eye samples 
were Lactobacillus (12%), Pseudomonas (11%), Escherichia/Shigella 
(7%; these genera are closely related and difficult to distinguish—­
Devanga Ragupathi et al., 2017—­and thus were grouped together) 
and Cutibacterium (6%; Table S2).
Of the 3751 ASVs in our study, three of them, an alphaproteo-
bacterium that could not be identified beyond the class level (LM: 
R2  =  .07, F1,163  =  13.74, p-­adj  =  .026) and two Pseudomonas spp. 
(R2 = .08, F1,163 = 14.67, p-­adj = .018; R2 = .12, F1,163 = 23.63, p-­
adj = .001; Table S3), increased in abundance with increasing malaria 
prevalence at sampling sites in ʻamakihi microbiomes. Additionally, 
354 ASVs were identified in our differential abundance analyses, 
with 149 being positively associated with birds likely to survive 
malaria infection (p-­adj < .05; Figure  4; Tables  S4–­S6), and there-
fore candidate microbes for further exploration. Our comparison 
between chronically infected ʻamakihi (malaria survivors) and unin-
fected ʻamakihi (malaria naïve) revealed 107 differentially abundant 
ASVs, 66 of which were more abundant in the survivors (Figure 4a). 
In our first interspecific comparison, 128 ASVs were differentially 
abundant between uninfected white-­eyes and uninfected ʻamakihi, 
with 61 showing positive associations with white-­eyes (Figure 4b). 
In the second comparison, 119 ASV abundances differed between 
uninfected white-­eyes and infected ʻamakihi, but only 22 of those 
ASVs were more abundant in the white-­eyes (Figure 4c).
4  |  DISCUSSION
Our study is among the first to assess correlates between malaria 
infection and microbiome composition in avian hosts sampled in a 
natural system. The volume of research supporting critical connec-
tions between microbiomes and malaria susceptibility and severity 
in mammals is steadily growing (Bamgbose et al., 2021); however, lit-
tle comparable research has been conducted in other host taxa or in 
wild environments (Trevelline et al., 2019; but see Lutz et al., 2021;

NAVINE et al.
Palinauskas et al.,  2022; Videvall, Marzal, et al.,  2021). We found 
no difference in cloacal microbiome alpha diversity between Hawaiʻi 
ʻamakihi and warbling white-­eyes and only a small, yet significant, 
difference in beta diversity, which aligns with several studies that 
have reported few consistent differences across host species that 
are relatively close phylogenetically (Hird et al., 2014). Although mi-
crobiome diversity did not covary with malaria infection, we iden-
tified 149 bacterial ASVs that were more abundant in birds that 
probably possess some immunity to malaria. Some of these can-
didate microbes may contribute to malaria severity modulation in 
wild birds and are valuable targets for functional profiling aimed at 
uncovering a mechanism by which malaria immunity may be aug-
mented in Hawaiian honeycreepers.
Environmental factors have been shown to strongly influ-
ence avian microbial communities (Bodawatta et al.,  2022; Hird 
et al., 2014), and therefore finding significant levels of variation 
in the cloacal microbiomes of birds sampled at different sites that 
ranged from 50 to 1750 m in elevation and from heavily anthropo-
genically disturbed to nearly pristine native forest was expected. 
However, finding that microbiome diversity was highly variable 
between the 2 years, despite no methodological differences in 
sample collection and processing techniques, was unexpected. 
It is possible that microbiome differences between the 2 years 
may have been partially attributable to variable weather patterns 
altering food item availability in the months leading up to sam-
pling (Bodawatta et al., 2021). For instance, mean and minimum 
monthly temperatures, as well as departure from normal mean and 
minimum monthly temperatures, in January to July (our sampling 
windows) varied between 2019 and 2020, with 2020 being gener-
ally warmer (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,

total monthly rainfall and deviation from normal rainfall did not 
vary between years in the months that were sampled. Climatic 
factors also influence mosquito distribution and malarial parasite 
development, and therefore selective disease pressure (LaPointe

showed higher abundance of Proteobacteria, which is congruent 
with gut microbiota imbalances seen in mammals with malaria 
(Bamgbose et al., 2021; Ippolito et al., 2018). Proteobacteria are 
frequently among the most abundant bacteria in bird gut micro-
biomes (Bodawatta et al.,  2022), and their higher abundance in 
infected birds may be due to opportunistic expansion in compro-
mised hosts (Shin et al., 2015). More informative are the patterns 
that we detected in the differential abundance of certain ASVs 
between birds of variable susceptibility to malaria mortality.
Three bacterial genera of interest were prominent among can-
didate ASVs, Escherichia, Lactobacillus and Pseudomonas. Escherichia 
and Lactobacillus spp. are well supported in their potential to mod-
ulate malaria susceptibility and disease severity in mammalian 
species (Bamgbose et al.,  2021). In laboratory mice, experimental 
colonization of the gut with Escherichia coli O86:B7 stimulated the 
production of galactose-­alpha-­1,3-­galactose (alpha-­gal) antibodies 
by the host's immune system, enabling the rapid identification and 
suppression of alpha-­gal-­expressing Plasmodium during infection 
(Yilmaz et al.,  2014). A recent study demonstrated that infection 
with P. relictum induces alpha-­gal antibodies in bird sera (Palinauskas 
et al., 2022), indicating a similar mechanism of protection may ex-
tend to avian hosts. Lactobacillus spp. are common vertebrate sym-
bionts with diverse functions and documented abilities to modulate 
host immune responses, and have been the focus of many probi-
otic studies, including those exploring malaria control strategies 
(Bamgbose et al., 2021). In a model mouse system, supplementation 
of yogurt spiked with Lactobacillus spp. significantly attenuated the 
severity of malaria in susceptible mice (Villarino et al., 2016), poten-
tially by increasing nitric oxide concentrations in the host's blood, 
thereby inhibiting Plasmodium growth during the erythrocytic stage 
of infection (Martinez-­Gómez et al., 2006). No connection between 
Pseudomonas spp. in host microbiomes and Plasmodium infection has 
yet been uncovered. However, the presence of Pseudomonas putida 
in vector mosquito midguts, where the bacteria can interact with 
parasites directly, has been implicated in blocking Plasmodium devel-
opment (Bahia et al., 2014).
Lactobacillus and Escherichia/Shigella were among the top genera 
in white-­eye microbiomes, accounting for ~12% and 7% ASV relative 
abundance, respectively, but both were relatively uncommon, <1% 
relative abundance, in ʻamakihi. Further, four Lactobacillus spp. and 
an Escherichia/Shigella sp. (as well as two ASVs in the same family, 
Enterobacteriaceae, that could not be identified to the genus level) 
were significantly more abundant in white-­eyes than in ʻamakihi. 
Cross-­reactive alpha-­gal antibody production stimulated by these 
microbes may be working synergistically with white-­eye genetics 
and behaviours to protect them from malaria mortality. Interestingly, 
one Lactobacillus sp. in particular was significantly more abundant 
in white-­eyes and in ʻamakihi that survived malaria infection than 
in ʻamakihi naïve to P.  relictum exposure. However, white-­eyes 
and survivor ʻamakihi had similar abundances of this Lactobacillus 
sp. Taken together, these comparisons indicate that harbouring a 
greater abundance of these microbes in the gut microbiome may 
potentially be contributing to increased survival rates in ʻamakihi. 
Pseudomonas was the top genus in ʻamakihi microbiomes, accounting 
for ~17% ASV relative abundance, and two Pseudomonas spp. found 
in ʻamakihi microbiomes were positively associated with malaria 
prevalence at sampling sites. However, because malarial parasites 
circulate in the blood of avian hosts, it is unclear if Pseudomonas spp. 
can block Plasmodium development in birds as has been found in 
mosquito midguts (Bahia et al., 2014).
Although the number of avian microbiome studies is rapidly 
growing (Bodawatta et al.,  2022), the current lack of character-
ized avian microbes in taxonomic databases poses barriers to the 
interpretation of the data generated by studies such as ours. Even 
at the phylum level, we were unable to taxonomically assign a no-
table number of ASVs, which has been highlighted as a prevailing 
limitation to microbiome studies (Levin et al., 2021). Microbes that 
have been found to be influential in malaria immunity have mainly 
been members of mammalian intestinal communities (Morffy 
Smith et al., 2019; Stough et al., 2016; Villarino et al., 2016; Yilmaz 
et al., 2014); however, we used cloacal microbiome samples because 
they are substantially less invasive to collect and were logistically 
practical. Cloacal and faecal microbiomes are not perfect repre-
sentatives of the microbial community in other regions of the gut 
(Videvall et al.,  2018), and despite the added challenge, sampling 
the ileum, caecum or colon in laboratory experiments may reveal 
stronger associations between commensal microbes and infection 
response. Field studies that concentrate efforts on resampling in-
dividuals over time or controlled laboratory experiments (such as 
proposed in Palinauskas et al., 2022) would facilitate tracking micro-
biome changes over the course of infection, and potentially also the 
sampling of microbiomes of birds that succumb to malaria, which was 
not possible for our study. We used cross-­sectional comparisons be-
tween chronically infected survivors and uninfected, malaria-­naïve 
ʻamakihi, as well as comparisons with a malaria-­resistant species, 
to identify microbes that may be associated with malaria immunity. 
Thus, we are unable to distinguish if greater ASV abundances re-
sult from a selective pressure to harbour bacteria with protective 
effects, a proliferation as a result of the potential disruptive effects 
of chronic infection, or species-­specific differences. Moreover, our 
pool of naïve ʻamakihi probably consisted of a mixture of birds that 
would either survive or die upon exposure; this heterogeneity may 
have weakened our ability to detect if beneficial microbes are in 
greater abundance in survivors. Although additional studies to sup-
port our findings are needed, we were able to detect promising as-
sociations between gut microbiomes and malaria parasites in both 
susceptible and resistant birds in a natural setting.
To conclude, we have shown that the malaria-­resistant white-­
eye harbours microbes with established connections to malaria im-
munity in greater abundance than ʻamakihi. The candidate microbes 
we have outlined here warrant further investigation to elucidate the 
potential value of supplementing malaria-­susceptible Hawaiian hon-
eycreepers with immune-­modulating bacteria. Lactobacillus spp. in 
particular show promise as they are frequently used as probiotics 
in other systems and are less likely than Escherichia spp. to become 
opportunistic pathogens (Bamgbose et al.,  2021). Pseudomonas

spp. may also be valuable candidates for investigation as they ap-
pear to be naturally abundant in ʻamakihi microbiomes, may inhibit 
P. relictum development (Bahia et al., 2014), and could represent a 
unique and unexplored immune strategy evolving in ʻamakihi. Orally 
delivered prophylactic probiotics have been effective in mitigating 
disease experimentally with mice and poultry models (Broom & 
Kogut, 2018; Hodžić et al., 2020; Mateos-­Hernández et al., 2020; 
Villarino et al.,  2016) and have garnered scientific attention for 
their potential to lessen the burden of malaria on human health 
(Bamgbose et al., 2021; Hodžić et al., 2020; Ngwa & Pradel, 2015). 
They may also provide a useful strategy for the conservation of wild-
life species on the brink of extinction. Targeted probiotics that could 
be administered in food supplementations to endangered Hawaiian 
honeycreepers in the wild and captive breeding programmes may be 
an effective and practical approach for bolstering malaria immunity 
in the face of increasing disease pressure in Hawaiʻi.
