Abstract
Background: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) harbors somatic hypermutation (SHM) in the immunoglobulin
heavy chain and light chain variable region genes, IGHV and IGK/LV. Recent studies have revealed that IGV SHM
creates neoantigens that activate T-cell responses against B-cell lymphoma.
Methods: To determine the clinical relevance of IGV SHM in DLBCL treated with standard immunochemotherapy,
we performed next-generation sequencing of the immunoglobulin variable regions and complementarity
determining region 3 (CDR3) for 378 patients with de novo DLBCL. The prognostic effects of IGV SHM and ongoing
SHM or intra-clonal heterogeneity were analyzed in the training (192 patients), validation (186 patients), and overall
DLBCL cohorts. To gain mechanistic insight, we analyzed the predicted IG-derived neoantigens’ immunogenicity
potential, determined by the major histocompatibility complex-binding affinity and the frequency-of-occurrence of
T cell-exposed motifs (TCEMs) in a TCEM repertoire derived from human proteome, microbiome, and pathogen
databases. Furthermore, IGV SHM was correlated with molecular characteristics of DLBCL and PD-1/L1 expression in
the tumor microenvironment assessed by fluorescent multiplex immunohistochemistry.

Results: SHM was commonly found in IGHV and less frequently in IGK/LV. High levels of clonal IGHV SHM (SHMhigh)
were associated with prolonged overall survival in DLBCL patients, particularly those without BCL2 or MYC
translocation. In contrast, long heavy chain CDR3 length, the presence of IGHV ongoing SHM in DLBCL, and high
clonal IGK/LV SHM in germinal center B-cell–like (GCB)-DLBCL were associated with poor prognosis. These
prognostic effects were significant in both the training and validation sets. By prediction, the SHMhigh groups
harbored more potentially immune-stimulatory neoantigens with high binding affinity and rare TCEMs. PD-1/L1
expression in CD8+ T cells was significantly lower in IGHV SHMhigh than in SHMlow patients with activated B-cell–like
DLBCL, whereas PD-1 expression in CD4+ T cells and PD-L1 expression in natural killer cells were higher in IGK/LV
SHMhigh than in SHMlow patients with GCB-DLBCL. PD-L1/L2 (9p24.1) amplification was associated with high IGHV
SHM and ongoing SHM.
Conclusions: These results show for the first time that IGV SHMhigh and ongoing SHM have prognostic effects in
DLBCL and potential implications for PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and neoantigen-based immunotherapies.

Background
A characteristic of mature B-cell neoplasms compared with
other cancer cells is the somatic hypermutation (SHM) in
genes encoding immunoglobulin (IG) heavy chain (IGH)
and light chain (kappa or lambda, IGK/L) variable (V) re-
gions. IGV SHM is acquired during antigen-based affinity
maturation of activated B cells in the germinal center and
mediated by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)
[1–4]. AID can also mediate abnormal SHM, abnormal re-
arrangement of D (diversity), J (joining), and V gene seg-
ments (e.g., BCL2 translocation to the IGHJ region [5, 6]),
aberrant class-switch recombination (e.g., MYC transloca-
tion to the IG switch region) [5–7], and ongoing SHM in
malignant B cells, implicated in the pathogenesis and evolu-
tion of B-cell neoplasms [2, 8–10].
The prognostic significance of IGV SHM has not been
studied in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the
most common aggressive B-cell lymphoma. In addition
to the association with B-cell division and proliferation
in the germinal center reaction [3] and abnormal SHM,
IGV SHM may enhance the B-cell receptor (BCR) affin-
ity and B-cell survival, suggesting unfavorable prognostic
effects. Different from the tonic BCR signaling in
germinal-center
B-cell–like
(GCB)-DLBCL
[11,
12],
chronic active BCR signaling [13] in activated B-cell–like
(ABC)-DLBCL is driven by the self-antigen engagement
of BCR and essential for B-cell survival [14]. Self-
antigens can be derived from the idiotypic epitope in the
BCR’s own V region and engaged with BCR [14].
On the other hand, B-cell IG-derived peptides can be
processed and presented to major histocompatibility com-
plex (MHC)-restricted CD4+/CD8+ T cells [15–18]. In
mantle cell lymphoma, somatic neoantigens among all
MHC-bound peptides (pMHCs) are exclusively derived
from IGV and strongly biased towards MHC-II [18].
These neoantigens are mostly derived from framework re-
gion 3 (FW3) and complementarity determining region 3
(CDR3), and are created by either SHM or V-D-J recom-
bination. In contrast, no neoantigenic pMHC were de-
tected for somatically mutated non-IG genes, including
TP53 and CCND1, despite the whole-proteomic recovery
of non-neoantigenic pMHCs [18]. Similar results were
found in follicular lymphoma, DLBCL, and chronic
lymphoid leukemia (CLL) [19]. These results suggest that
IGV SHM, but not non-IG mutations derived from aging
or AID activities, has an important role in shaping the
immune response against B-cell lymphomas. However,
whether the positive role of IGV-derived neoantigens
is significant in patients treated with immunochem-
otherapy and how the abundance of neoantigens af-
fects the clinical outcome is unknown. A recent study
by single-molecule imaging in live primary T cells re-
vealed that with progressively higher pMHC densities,
the set point for T-cell receptor (TCR) activation in-
creases, and the cooperativity of pMHC:TCR binding
switches from positive to negative [20]. Ii is also
known that prolonged antigen exposure under subopti-
mal costimulatory conditions induces PD-1 expression
on T cells which dampens the T-cell response [21].
Our previous in silico analysis found that IG-derived
pMHCs’ T-cell exposed motifs (TCEMs), which are im-
portant determinants of the cognate interaction with the
TCR, are recurrent at a wide range of frequencies in a
large IGHV dataset [22]. Some TCEMs were rarely
present in the TCEM repertoire built from human
proteome, microbiome, and pathogenic bacteria data-
bases [22, 23]. It is logical that T cells encountering
abundant high-affinity pMHCs with germline or very
common TCEMs remain in a homeostatic balance but
mount an active immune response when encountering
exogenous or rare TCEMs on high-affinity pMHCs.
In this study, we performed next-generation sequen-
cing (NGS) of the IGV FW3 region and the entire CDR3
and investigated the prognostic significance of IGV

SHM and ongoing SHM in 378 DLBCL patients treated
with the standard immunochemotherapy regimen. In
silico prediction of IG-derived pMHCs, PD-1 and PD-1-
ligand 1/2 (PD-L1/2)'s cell-specific expression, BCL2/
MYC/BCL6 rearrangements and mutations, and BCR
signaling biomarkers were analyzed and correlated with
SHM to understand the prognostic effects.
Methods
Patients
The study cohort is composed of two independent co-
horts—a training set and a validation set, sequentially
constructed from 21 medical centers in North America
and Europe (CONSORT flow diagram in Additional file 1:
Figure S1a). Included patients were diagnosed between
1999 and 2009 with de novo DLBCL according to the
World Health Organization classification criteria; under-
went rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincris-
tine,
and
prednisone
(R-CHOP)
therapy;
and
had
diagnostic biopsy specimens sufficient for NGS. Patients
with transformed DLBCL, primary cutaneous DLBCL, or
primary central nervous
system
DLBCL and HIV-
positive patients were excluded. In total, 378 patients
(192 training and 186 validation) were sequenced for
IGH, and 269 patients also sequenced for IGK/L. The
clinical features of the overall, training, and validation
cohorts are in Additional file 2: Table S1. By either gene
expression profiling (GEP) deposited in GSE#31312 (n =
294) or by immunohistochemistry algorithm (n = 79)
[24, 25], 202 and 171 patients were classified as having
GCB-DLBCL and ABC-DLBCL, respectively. Compared
with GCB-DLBCL patients, ABC-DLBCL patients had
significantly poorer survival (Additional file 1: Figure
S1b). This study was part of the International DLBCL
Rituximab-CHOP Consortium Program and conducted
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki [24]. Ma-
terial transfer agreements were established and approved
by the institutional review board of each participating in-
stitution, and data collection protocols were approved as
being of minimal to no risk or as exempt by the institu-
tional review board of each participating institution.
Of the study cohort, 290 patients having a dominant
clonal IG sequence identified were analyzed for prognostic
impact. The median age was 63 years, the male-to-female
ratio was 1.34, and the median follow-up time was 44.5
months.
Molecular
characteristics,
including
B-cell-
associated gene signature [26], BCL2 and MYC transloca-
tion [27, 28], MYC and BCL6 mutation [29], and various
protein expression are available for some patients, with
numbers shown in Additional file 1: Figure S2.

specimens
using
an
Invitrogen
PureLink genomic DNA kit. DNA samples that passed
quantity and quality assessment were subjected to high-
throughput immunosequencing of the IGH and IGK/L
loci using the immunoSEQ™platform (Adaptive Biotech-
nologies, Seattle, WA) [30–32]. An average of 260 ng of
genomic DNA was used for each assay; the average se-
quencing depth of coverage was 162.08x, and the median
depth of coverage was 45.57x.
For the IGH locus, a set of multiplexed forward primers
matching V (CDR2/FW2) and D gene segment sequences
were combined with a set of reverse primers matching J
gene segment sequences to amplify both mature V-D-J
and immature D-J IGH rearrangements. The reported se-
quence region by the immunoSEQ hsIGH assay was 130
base pairs starting from the J gene segment. The IGH
CDR3 (HCDR3) sequences identified included a fraction
of the V region, the complete D and J regions, and ran-
dom nucleotide insertions. The average sequenced IGHV
region was ~ 100 base pairs (including mostly FW3, the
CDR3 V fraction, and some CDR2) covering about one-
third of the IGHV gene; the median and mean HCDR3
lengths were both 48 base pairs/16 amino acids. For
amplifying all possible V-D-J combinations, the assay
employed a single-tube, multiplex PCR assay with 84 V
and 15 D forward and 9 J reverse primers.
For the removal of potential PCR bias, every possible
V-J and D-J pair was chemically synthesized as a tem-
plate with specific barcodes. These templates were engi-
neered to be recognizable as non-biologic and have
universal 3′ and 5′ ends to permit amplification with uni-
versal primers and subsequent quantification by high-
throughput sequencing. This synthetic immune system
could then be used to calibrate the multiplex PCR assay.
The multiplex pool of templates was amplified and se-
quenced iteratively with our IGH V/D- and J-specific
primers, and the primer concentrations were adjusted to
re-balance PCR amplification. Once the multiplex primer
mixture amplified each V and J template nearly equiva-
lently, residual bias was removed computationally.
A similar methodology was used for analyzing the IGK
and IGL loci with the immunoSEQ hsIGKL assay, which
employed 29 IGK V and 46 IGL V forward primers, plus
6 IGK J and 6 IGL J reverse primers. In addition, kappa
deleting element rearrangements with the V region and
the intragenic Jκ-Cκ region were also amplified. The re-
ported sequence was ~ 130 base pairs. The median and
mean lengths of light chain CDR3 were both 30 base
pairs/10 amino acids.
Following high-throughput sequencing, the raw se-
quencing data were processed with a complexity filter
and nearest neighbor algorithm to remove technical fail-
ures and correct sequencing errors. A bioinformatics
pipeline clustered the sequences into distinct clonotypes
based on their CDR3 sequences to determine the overall

frequencies of clones. Sequences were delineated accord-
ing to criteria established by the International ImMuno-
GeneTics (IMGT) collaboration [33] with a standard
algorithm to identify V, D, and J gene segments. Se-
quences containing premature stop codons or out-of-
frame insertions or deletions that resulted in frame shifts
were classified as non-productive.
Clones that were relatively expanded with > 5% overall
frequency in a sequence repertoire were identified as
index trackable sequences. The dominant clones were
defined as diagnostic clones representative of the malig-
nant transformation. IGV point mutations were identi-
fied by comparing the clonal sequences with the known
IMGT germline sequences and assigned as SHM events,
allowing a determination of the overall SHM rate. The
cutoff for SHM-positive status was > 2% deviation or <
98% identity, as used in CLL routine clinical practice
and earlier studies of DLBCL [14, 34, 35].
Intra-clonal IGV variations were further analyzed in
SHM-positive cases. Any sequence within the repertoire
that included the same point mutations of the same
germline sequence as the diagnostic sequence plus at
least one additional point mutation was identified as an
intra-clonal variant of the diagnostic clone. The cutoff
for the presence of ongoing IGHV SHM was ≥2% accu-
mulative frequency of intra-clonal variant sequences in
the IGHV repertoire. The cutoff for high IGK/LV on-
going SHM was ≥17 intra-clonal sequence variants.
MHC-binding prediction
MHC-II binding predictions were made using neural net-
work ensembles (NNEs) trained on MHC II binding data
obtained from the IEDB repository (www.iedb.org). We
used NNE methods as described previously [36] with the
modification that ensembles of neural networks were used.
NNE predictions of the Loge of ic50 were made for DP (13
genotypes), DQ (28 genotypes), and DR (24 genotypes). All
Loge ic50 binding predictions were standardized to a com-
mon scale for all alleles using a Johnson distribution [37] to
transform the raw data into zero mean, unit variance
values. The threshold of high-affinity binding was set at −1
standard deviation from the mean of the zero mean, unit
variance values. This approximates the highest 16 percen-
tiles of binding affinity. By way of reference, for the very
common DRB01*0101 allele, −1 standard deviation below
the mean converts to an ic50 of approximately 50 nM.
Examining the endosomal peptidase cleavage sites in-
dicated that a significant portion of the peptides would
be expected to be excised by endosomal cathepsin B, L
and S activity [22].
Frequency-of-occurrence of TCEM
MHC-II TCEMs are derived from one of two discon-
tinuous pentamers of amino acids in the pMHC-II
facing outwards and engaging the TCR [22, 38, 39]. A
frequency classification (FC) metric was devised to dir-
ectly index the frequency of cognate T-cell encounters
of the particular TCEM, with a log base 2 transform-
ation of the frequency-of-occurrence of 205 TCEM in
approximately 50 million immunoglobulin sequences of
healthy subjects [23, 40]. The scale of FC ranges from
FC1 (high frequency = 1/21) to FC24 (low frequency = 1/
224).
T-cell stimulation metric
For relatively rare TCEMs (FC > 16) in a high-affinity
peptide, an empirical stimulation metric was computed
using the principle of the additivity of variance across
the entire population of allele genes [23]:
Stimulation ¼
XN
a¼1σa2FC−16
Where
a ¼ HLA allele;
standardized binding ¼ σa <¼ −1;
and
−log2 frequency ¼ FC > 16
PD-1/PD-L1/PD-L2 expression and PDL1/L2 genetic
analysis
Cell type-specific expression of PD-1 and PD-L1/L2
were quantitated using the fluorescent multiplex immu-
nohistochemistry platform MultiOmyx™; PDL1/L2 copy
number alterations were evaluated by fluorescence in
situ hybridization as described previously [41]. NGS
RNA
fusion
assay
was
used
to
detect
PD-L1/2
rearrangement.
Statistical analysis
Clinical and molecular features were compared using
the Fisher exact test and unpaired (2-tailed) t-test. Over-
all survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were
calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of last
follow-up or death and to the date of disease progression
or death, respectively. The survival rates of two groups
of patients were compared using Kaplan-Meier curves
and the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test using GraphPad
Prism 7. Multivariate analyses with Cox proportional
hazards regression models were performed using SPSS
statistics 24. P values ≤0.05 were considered statistically
significant. All comparisons were performed in the over-
all study cohort and the training and validation sets. The
Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was performed for the
multiple survival comparisons in the study cohort.

Results
High degree of clonal IGHV SHM correlates with favorable
prognosis in DLBCL
IGHV index trackable sequences were identified in 224
patients, whereas no clonal sequences showed significant
expansion in 65 patients, and the sequencing reads were
insufficient for clonal analysis in the other 89 patients.
Of the 224 patients with index trackable sequences, 145
had IMGT germline V-D-J sequences identified for diag-
nostic sequences (Additional file 3), whereas 79 (35%)
had only reference D-J sequences resolved in IMGT
(CONSORT diagram in Additional file 1: Figure S3).
The distribution of IGHD and IGHV gene usage is shown
in Additional file 1: Figure S4a-b. The IGHD3 and IGHV3
families were used most frequently. Consistent with earlier
studies [14, 34], IGHV4–34 was significantly overrepresented
in ABC-DLBCL compared with GCB-DLBCL (Additional
file 1: Figure S4c) but did not have a significant prognostic
effect. The distribution of IGHV mutation degree (range, 0–
20%) is shown in Additional file 1: Figure S5a; compared
with ABC-DLBCL, GCB-DLBCL had a significantly higher
mean mutation degree (9.6% vs 7.4%, P = 0.012). Most pa-
tients (127 of 145, 88%) were SHM-positive. The prognosis
of SHM-positive and SHM-negative patients was similar.
However, with the median SHM degree as the cutoff,
SHMhigh was associated with significantly better OS (P =
0.011, Fig. 1a) but not PFS (P = 0.10, Additional file 1: Fig-
ure S5b). SHMhigh was associated with a significantly higher
frequency of BCL2 (but not MYC) translocation (BCL2-R)
in DLBCL overall (28.1%, Table 1) and in GCB-DLBCL
(55%) (Additional file 2: Table S2), which may have con-
founded the prognostic analysis. After the exclusion of pa-
tients with BCL2-R+ DLBCL, SHMhigh was associated with
significantly better OS (P = 0.006, Fig. 1a) and PFS (P =
0.012) in BCL2-R−patients. Similar favorable effects of
SHMhigh were found in MYC-R−patients (for OS, P =

significantly better OS and progression-free survival (PFS) in the training set, and significantly better OS in the BCL2-R−cases of the validation set.

0.0012, Fig. 1a; for PFS, P = 0.0047). When partitioning
DLBCL into GCB and ABC subtypes, the favorable prog-
nostic effect of IGHV SHMhigh was significant in ABC-
DLBCL and marginally significant in BCL2-R−and MYC-
R−GCB-DLBCL (for OS, P = 0.059 and 0.066, respectively;
Additional file 1: Figure S5c-d). Multivariate analysis with
adjustment for clinical factors (Additional file 2: Table S2–
S3) and MYC-R revealed that IGHV-SHMhigh was an inde-
pendent prognostic factor for significantly longer PFS in pa-
tients with ABC-DLBCL (Additional file 2: Table S4).
When examining in the training and validation sets sep-
arately, in the training set, IGHV SHMhigh was associated
with better OS and PFS with and without the exclusion of
patients with BCL2-R+ DLBCL; in the validation set,
IGHV SHMhigh was associated with significantly better OS
only after the exclusion of patients with BCL2-R+ DLBCL
(Fig. 1b). Together, these results confirmed the favorable
effects of IGHV SHMhigh in DLBCL, although the signifi-
cance may differ in DLBCL subsets.
Shorter HCDR3 length correlates with favorable prognosis
in DLBCL
V-D-J resolved diagnostic sequences were rarely unpro-
ductive; only 7 patients had nonsense or out-of-frame
mutations. GCB-DLBCL patients with a shorter (<
median/mean) amino acid length of HCDR3 (hyper-
variable sequences) had significantly better OS (P =
0.0062) and PFS (P = 0.0091; Fig. 1c) despite having a
significantly higher proportion of stage III/IV disease
(Additional file 2: Table S5). With a cutoff of 2 amino
acids higher than the median/mean, short length was
associated with significantly better OS (P = 0.0077;
Fig. 1c) and PFS (P = 0.002) in overall DLBCL and
showed a trend towards better PFS in ABC-DLBCL
(P = 0.054; Additional file 1: Figure S6a). In multivari-
ate analysis, short HCDR3 length was a favorable
prognostic factor independent of clinical parameters in
only GCB-DLBCL (Additional file 2: Table S4). In line
with earlier findings that CDR3 shortening is associ-
ated with SHM [42], shorter HCDR3 length was asso-
ciated with higher mean IGHV SHM in GCB-DLBCL,
and higher IGK/LV SHM in ABC-DLBCL (Additional
file 1: Figure S6b).
In both the training and validation sets, the favorable
prognostic effects of short HCDR3 length were signifi-
cant. The effects in ABC- and GCB-DLBCL were signifi-
cant in the training and validation set, respectively
(Additional file 1: Figure S6c-d).

IGHV SHMhigh is associated with increased predicted
neoantigens with rare neoepitopes and lower PD-1
expression in CD8 T cells in ABC-DLBCL
Consistent with earlier studies [18, 19], large numbers of
IG-derived peptides were predicted to bind MHC-II (but
not MHC-I) with high affinity in patients with a productive
IGH diagnostic sequence. The IGHV-SHMhigh group Com-
pared with the IGHV-SHMlow group had significantly more
peptides with high HLA-DR-binding affinity predicted
(3027 vs. 2688, ~ 16% of total peptides), with either germ-
line (FC < 10, frequency > 1/210) or mutated TCEMs. The
stimulation metric for TCEMs with an FC > 16 (relatively
rare neoepitopes), which are potentially immune reactive,
are plotted in Fig. 2a. These neoepitopes were a minority
among patients’ TCEM repertoire identified from all index
trackable sequences, as shown by the FC histogram (Fig.
2b). Compared with the IGHV-SHMlow group, the IGHV-
SHMhigh group had more pMHCs with TCEM FC > 16
derived from the CDR3 (303 vs. 258) and FW3 (140 vs. 65)
regions, an increased percentage of FW3 origin (4.6% vs
2.4%), and an increased percentage of rare TCEMs with an
FC of 19–24 (more rare neoepitopes; Fig. 2c). A similar pat-
tern of differences in pMHCs and neoepitopes between the
SHMhigh and SHMlow groups was found in the BCL2-R−,
MYC-R−, and ABC-DLBCL subcohorts as well as the train-
ing and validation sets (Additional file 1: Figure S7a-b).
Fig. 2 Predicted MHC-binding peptides for immunoglobulin diagnostic sequences and frequency of T-cell exposed motifs (TCEMs). a Regional
distribution of relatively rare neoantigens (TCEM frequency classification [FC]> > 16) derived from light chain (left) and heavy chain (right)
immunoglobulin genes in DLBCL patients. Protein sequences are aligned with cysteine at the start of complementarity determining region 3
(CDR3) at the 0 of the X axis; peptides upstream of CDR3 were defined as framework region 3 (FW3). The stimulation metric was computed using
the principle of the additivity of variance and is a product of the standardized MHC-II-binding affinity multiplied by the FC summed over all HLA-
DR alleles. Each dot represents one peptide predicted as having high MHC-II-binding affinity (exceeding the −1 standard deviation threshold for
MHC derived from 24 HLA-DR alleles) and relatively rare TCEMs (FC > 16). The color intensities of the dots are scaled on the FC scale, which
ranges from FC16 to the very rare FC24. b Histograms showing the distribution of the FC of the TCEMs in all MHC-II-binding peptides predicted

high degree of heavy chain or light chain IGV SHM, cases with high degree of heavy chain or light chain IGV SHM had higher frequencies of
relatively rare TCEMs (FC > 16)

To gain insight into the immune surveillance in the
tumor microenvironment, fluorescent mIHC was per-
formed to evaluate immune cell-infiltration and cell-
specific PD-1/L1/L2 expression (representative image in
Fig. 3a) [41], correlating with IGHV SHM and CDR3
length. Long HCDR3 length was associated with higher
PD-L1 expression in B cells in GCB-DLBCL (Fig. 3b; sig-
nificant in the training set; marginally significant in the
validation set) and higher PD-1 expression in CD4+/
CD8+ T cells in ABC-DLBCL (Fig. 3b; significant in the
validation set; strong trends in the training set). In ABC-
DLBCL, IGHV-SHMhigh was associated with significantly
lower PD-1 expression in T cells and B cells in the over-
all cohort and the training set, and significantly lower
PD-L1 expression in CD8+ T cells in the overall cohort
and the validation set (Fig. 3c). In the overall ABC-
DLBCL cohort, IGHV SHMhigh cases compared with
SHMlow cases had significantly lower mean cellularity of
CD4+ T cells but similar cellularity of CD8+ T cells (Add-
itional file 1: Figure S7c). B-cell PD-L2 expression and
PD-L1/PD-L2 gene amplification (very low frequency in
the study cohort, predominantly found in ABC-DLBCL)
were associated with high IGHV SHM (Fig. 3d).
Together, these findings suggest that the IGHV-
SHMhigh
group
produced
more
T-cell
stimulatory
neoantigens, which may be relevant for PD-1 expression
regulation and function of cognate T cells.
Ongoing IGHV SHM correlates with significantly poorer
survival in DLBCL
Intra-clonal sequence variations (Fig. 4a) were identified
in 102 (83%) of the productive IGHV SHM-positive
cases (most frequently in the IGHV3 and IGHV4 fam-
ilies; Additional file 1: Figure S8a). With a cutoff of sub-
clonal frequency at the 70th percentile, ongoing IGHV
SHM was associated with significantly poorer OS in pa-
tients with DLBCL in the univariate analysis (P = 0.003;
Fig. 4b) and poorer OS and PFS in the multivariate ana-
lysis (Additional file 2: Table S4). The adverse prognostic
effect was significant regardless of GCB/ABC and MYC-
Fig. 3 Comparison of PD-1 expression between groups. a A representative image of a DLBCL sample is from an ABC-DLBCL case with a low
degree of IGHV SHM (2.94%) and a long (21 amino acids) heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 (HCDR3). Fluorescence multiplex
immunohistochemistry detected that PD-1 was expressed in T cells and proximal to PD-L1-expressing B cells. b Long HCDR3 length was
associated with high PD-L1 expression in B cells in GCB-DLBCL and high PD-1 expression in CD4+/CD8+ T cells in ABC-DLBCL. c In the training
set, a high degree of IGHV SHM (SHMhi) was associated with low PD-1 expression in CD8+/CD4+ T cells and B cells in ABC-DLBCL. In the
validation set, IGHV SHMhi was associated with lower PD-L1 expression in CD8+ T cells. d PD-L2 protein expression in B cells was associated with
a high degree of IGHV SHM. PD-L1 gene amplification was associated with a significantly higher mean degree of SHM in the IGHV diagnostic
sequence. PD-L1/L2 gene amplification was associated with a higher mean percentage of subclones with IGHV ongoing SHM in the
sequence repertoire

R status and was significant in BCL2-R−(for OS, P =
0.007, for PFS, P = 0.01) but not BCL2-R+ patients. Simi-
lar prognostic results were found in both the training
and validation cohorts (Fig. 4c).
Ongoing IGHV SHM was associated with AICDA up-
regulation in overall DLBCL and the validation set. PD-
L1/PD-L2 gene amplification and macrophage PD-L2
expression were associated with higher ongoing SHM
(Fig. 3d, Additional file 1: Figure S8b).
IGK/LV SHMhigh correlates with significantly poorer
survival in patients with GCB-DLBCL
Light chain diagnostic sequences were identified in 205
(76%) DLBCL patients (CONSORT diagram in Add-
itional file 1: Figure S3). Consistent with the order of re-
arrangement, IGL clones were seen only in patients with
unproductive IGK. No prognostic difference was ob-
served between the kappa and lambda types. Compared
with IGHV, IGK/LV had significantly fewer mutations.
The frequency of IGK/LV SHM-positive cases was
53.6% (105 of 205). There were many more IGK clones
with no SHM than IGH or IGL clones with no SHM
(Additional file 1: Figure S8c). IGLV-SHM had higher
correlation with IGHV-SHM than IGKV-SHM (Add-
itional file 1: Figure S8d).
IGK/LV SHM-positive status was not associated with
prognostic effect. However, with a high cutoff close to the
80th percentile, IGK/LV SHMhigh was associated with sig-
nificantly poorer OS and PFS in patients with GCB-DLBCL
(P < 0.0001 for OS, Fig. 5a; P = 0.0016 for PFS); the effects
were confirmed in both the training and validation cohorts
(Fig. 5b, Additional file 1: Figure S9a) and by multivariate
analysis (Additional file 2: Table S4). Like IGHV SHMhigh,
IGK/LV SHMhigh was associated with a higher frequency of
BCL2-R in DLBCL (35%, Table 1). However, the adverse
prognostic effect of IGK/LV SHMhigh was independent of
BCL2-R and MYC-R status and was strongest in BCL2-R+
GCB-DLBCL (Additional file 1: Figure S9b-c).
A short K/LCDR3 length (≤12 aa) was associated with
significantly better OS in DLBCL overall and in ABC-
DLBCL (P = 0.026 and 0.012, respectively; Additional file
1: Figure S9d). However, the prognostic effect was only
significant in the validation set (P = 0.015; it showed a
nonsignificant trend in the training set of ABC-DLBCL,
P = 0.15), and the number of cases with long K/LCDR3
length was small (4 and 3 in the training and validation
sets, respectively).

sufficient to drive lymphomagenesis, DLBCL cells exit the germinal center reaction. Predominant DLBCL clones may exhibit intra-clonal IGV
variations conferred by the ongoing SHM process. b IGHV ongoing SHM was associated with significantly poorer overall survival (OS) in the
overall study cohort. c IGHV ongoing SHM was associated with poorer OS in the overall validation cohort and in cases without BCL2
rearrangement (BCL2-R−) in both the training and validation sets

IGK/LV SHMhigh is associated with increased rare
neoepitopes and PD-1 expression on CD4+ T cells in GCB-
DLBCL
The T-cell stimulation metric for predicted MHC-II
neoantigens derived from productive IGK/L diagnostic
sequences is shown in Fig. 2a. Because the IGK/L
SHMhigh and SHMlow groups had unbalanced numbers
of patients, the groups’ mean numbers of predicted
pMHC-II were compared. IGK/LV SHMhigh patients had
a larger mean number (8.4 vs 4.5 per patient) and per-
centage (FW3-origin, 10% vs 2.7%; CDR3-origin, 9.1% vs
7.2%) of predicted pMHC-II with FC > 16 TCEMs, but
not total predicted pMHC-II (44 vs 46 per patient). The
association of IGK/L SHMhigh with more pMHC-II with
FC > 16 TCEMs per patient was observed in both the
training and validation sets.
Compared with IGK/LV SHMlow patients, IGK/LV
SHMhigh patients had significantly higher PD-L1 expres-
sion in natural killer cells (P = 0.037; Fig. 5c) and higher
CTSL1 (lysosomal protease genes cathepsin L [43])
mRNA expression in GCB-LDBCL (P = 0.038; Add-
itional file 1: Figure S9e), but significantly lower B-cell
PD-1 expression (P = 0.03) in ABC-DLBCL (Additional
file 1: Figure S9f). In contrast, IGHV SHMhigh was asso-
ciated with lower CTSF expression in GCB-DLBCL (P =
0.048; Additional file 1: Figure S9e). In the training but
not the validation set, IGK/LV SHMhigh patients had
higher PD-1 expression in CD4+ T cells in GCB-DLBCL
(P = 0.008, Fig. 5c) and higher AICDA mRNA in ABC-
DLBCL (P = 0.047).
Because the correlation findings were differential in
the training/validation sets and in the GCB/ABC sub-
types, these subsets/subtypes were compared. Compared
with the validation set, the training set had significantly
higher mean mRNA levels of several MHC-II genes
(HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB1/4) and
lysosomal protease genes (CTSH, ASNS, and GILT)
(expression data were extracted from the GEP #31312
deposit; Additional file 1: Figure S10a). These differences
were largely attributable to the validation set’s MYC-R+
cases (Additional file 1: Figure S10b), and there were no
significant expression differences (except for CTSH) be-
tween validation set’s MYC-R−cases and the training
set. In both the training and validation sets, MYC-R was
associated with downregulation of HLA-F, CTSH, and
CTSK in DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL.
In both the training and validation sets, ABC-DLBCL
compared with GCB-DLBCL had higher macrophage
and CD8+ T-cell infiltration, higher PD-L1+ expression
in B cells (Additional file 1: Figure S10c for the overall
cohort), higher HLA-C/E, CTSZ, and CTSC mRNA, and
lower HLA-DQB2, HLA-DRB4, and CTSK mRNA ex-
pression. In the training set only, ABC compared with GCB
subtype had significantly higher CTSB, CTSL1, and CTSS
expression, and in the validation set only, significantly
higher CTSL3 expression and lower CTSF Expression.

High intra-clonal IGK/LV diversity is associated with
unfavorable prognosis
Of the 103 productive IGK/LV SHM-positive cases, 91
(88%) had intra-clonal IGK/L variants (ongoing SHM).
The numbers of sequences with ongoing IGK/LV SHM
showed negative association with IGV SHM (Fig. 5d,
Additional file 1: Figure S11a) and CTSS (a cathepsin
with an essential role in proteolytic processing of MHC
class II-associated invariant-chain peoptide fragments
[43]) mRNA levels (Fig. 5d). PD-L1 polyploidy, exclu-
sively found in GCB-DLBCL, was associated with on-
going IGK/LV SHM (Additional file 2: Table S6).
High
intra-clonal
IGK/L
diversity
(≥17
subclones),
present in only 9 patients (8 were GCB-DLBCL), was asso-
ciated with unfavorable clinical parameters, significantly
poorer OS/PFS, and distinct gene signatures in DLBCL and
GCB-DLBCL (Fig. 5e, Additional file 1: Figure S11b-c, Add-
itional file 2: Table S6–S7). However, the prognostic effects
were significant only in the training set (Additional file 1:
Figure S11d) and not significant in the multivariate analysis.
Multiple comparison correction was performed (Add-
itional file 2: Table S8) and the validated prognostic effects
with potential underlying mechanisms are illustrated in
Fig. 6.
Discussion
IGV
SHM,
which
is
distinguished
from
scattered
genome-wide aging-associated non-IG somatic muta-
tions by high mutation density and protein expression
[44], has an essential role in neoantigen presentation
[18, 44]. However, the clinical relevance of IGV SHM is
less studied than that of non-IG mutations, likely owing
to technical and interpretive difficulties. In this study,
IGV SHMhigh and ongoing SHM identified through NGS
showed prognostic significance in a large cohort of pa-
tients with de novo DLBCL treated with R-CHOP, which
was validated in the training and validation sets.
First, IGHV SHMhigh was associated with significantly
longer OS in DLBCL patients and longer OS and PFS in
DLBCL patients without MYC/BCL2 translocations, which
is reminiscent of the favorable PFS and OS incrementally
associated with IGHV% deviation in CLL patients [45].
Consistent with the favorable prognostic effect, IGHV-
SHMhigh patients had more enriched MHC-II neoantigens
with rare neoepitopes by in silico prediction [22] but lower
T-cell PD-1 expression in ABC-DLBCL. The implications
of IGHV SHM for T-cell response activation and regulation
warrants future study for functional validation and thera-
peutic exploration. A study showed that treatment with
CpG, a TLR9 agonist, promoted MHC-II presentation of
IG-derived neoantigens of mantle cell lymphoma cells [19].
Second, compared with IGHV, IGK/LV had less SHM,
but IGK/LV SHMhigh was associated with significantly
poorer OS and PFS and high PD-1 expression in CD4+
T cells and PD-L1 in natural killer cells in GCB-DLBCL,
even though FW3-derived MHC-II neoantigens with
rare neoepitopes were significantly higher in IGK/LV
SHMhigh DLBCL compared with IGHV SHMhigh DLBCL

J Immunother Cancer: first published as 
(4.4 vs 2 per patient) and IGH/K/LV SHMlow DLBCL (1
per patient). These results appeared to suggest that the
excessive neoantigens in IGK/LV SHMhigh patients with
GCB-DLBCL had a negative role in T-cell response by
inducing PD-1. In addition, IGK/LV SHMhigh in GCB-
DLBCL could be a biomarker for stronger BCR affinity
and higher B-cell proliferation propensity [3, 14], there-
fore synergizing with unfavorable BCL2-R which en-
hanced cell survival. This is supported by the mutually
exclusive pattern of IGK/LV SHMhigh and IGK/LV on-
going SHMhigh, suggesting a survival advantage of the
expanded
IGK/LV-SHMhigh clone, leading
to intra-
clonal homogeneity.
Third, the presence of IGHV ongoing SHM or intra-
clonal heterogeneity had an adverse prognostic effect in
SHM-positive patients. Whether the adverse prognosis
resulted from subclonal evolution, such as the selection
of clones with less immunogenicity [46], loss of MHC
expression, or enhanced cell survival, could be revealed
by collecting serial tumor biopsy specimens during and
after therapy in future prospective studies and subjecting
them to longitudinal NGS and flow cytometry experi-
ments to monitor the clonal evolution. The higher on-
going SHM in DLBCL patients than in CLL patients and
its adverse prognostic effect in IGHV SHM-positive case,
may explain why SHM-positivity status lacks a favorable
prognostic effect in DLBCL but not CLL [45, 47].
In addition, as chromosome 9p24.1 amplification has
been correlated with the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in
Hodgkin lymphoma [48], it would be interesting to in-
vestigate the biomarker value of IGHV SHMhigh and
IGV ongoing SHM for clinical response to PD-1 block-
ade immunotherapy in DLBCL, which showed associa-
tions with 9p24.1 amplification and PD-1 expression in
the current study. In melanoma patients treated with
anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, high tumor clonal mutation
load was associated with improved overall survival and
higher TCR-clonality (less diverse repertoire) predicted
response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy [49, 50].
Conclusions
In summary, clonal IGHV SHMhigh had favorable prog-
nostic effect in patients with DLBCL without BCL2/
MYC translocation, whereas IGHV ongoing SHM and
clonal IGK/LV SHMhigh had adverse prognostic effects
in
DLBCL
and
GCB-DLBCL
patients,
respectively.
Neoantigen loads, PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint, and
BCR affinity and signaling may contribute to these prog-
nostic effects. IGV SHM evaluation has implications for
the selection of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, BCR-targeted
agents, and effective vaccines in DLBCL patients. Be-
cause NGS is available in clinical practice, the applica-
tion of IG NGS with immunoSEQ is feasible and can
improve risk stratification at diagnosis and identification
of dominant tumor clones in lymphoma. Future studies
are warranted to determine the value of IG NGS in
tracking resistant clones expanded at relapse and in indi-
cating response to immunotherapy and to investigate
the therapeutic potential of IG-based vaccines and how
IG-derived neoantigens shape the immune response.
