Abstract
Background: Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic inflammatory oral mucosal disease in which comprehensive
inflammation-related cytokines are involved. These cytokines are commonly produced by immune cells and specific
nonimmune cells including keratinocytes, endothelial cells and fibroblasts. This raises the question of whether
fibroblasts in OLP lesions contribute to the inflammatory process upon inflammatory simulation.
Methods: Primary cultured Oral lichen-planus-associated fibroblasts (OLP AFs, n = 5) and normal buccal mucosal
fibroblasts (NFs, n = 5) were examined by immunohistochemistry, Western blotting and reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reactions (RT-PCR). Various inflammatory mediators were evaluated with a multiplex assay. Differences among
groups were assessed using a Student’s test or repeated measures one-way ANOVA, as appropriate.
Results: OLP AFs express significantly higher levels of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) than NFs, indicating the presence
of myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts secrete Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in response to
Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (pg. LPS).
Conclusion: OLP AFs demonstrated α-SMA expression and secreted pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to
pg. LPS stimulation.

Background
Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic inflammatory oral
mucosal disease with the potential for malignant transform-
ation [1]. The prevalence of OLP varies from 0.5 to 4% in
the general population [2], and the malignant transform-
ation rate is 0–2%. The clinical presentation of OLP in-
volves a ranges from asymptomatic white keratotic lesions
to painful erosions and ulcerations, with three distinctive
clinical forms: reticular, erosive, and atrophic. Up to now,
diagnosis of malignant transformation have been performed
with biopsies. The histology of OLP is characterized by a
dense subepithelial lympho-histiocytic infiltrate, increased
numbers of intra-epithelial lymphocytes, and degeneration
of basal keratinocytes.Degenerating basal keratinocytes
form colloid bodies that appear as homogenous eosino-
philic globules [1] In retrospective studies of Chinese cases,
the erosive form was the most likely type to develop into
oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) [3–5]. Additionally,
increased levels of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-4, tumor
necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and other
cytokines are more closely associated with the erosive form
than the reticular and atrophic forms [6–8]. Although the

pathogenesis is not completely clear, immune and inflam-
matory factors are thought to play crucial roles in the devel-
opment
of
OLP
[9].
Aberrant
production
of
many
inflammatory mediators occurs in OLP lesions. Cytokines
and chemokines, including ILs [10], transforming growth
factor-β (TGF-β), IFN-γ and TNF-α [11–13], have been
strongly implicated.
In the environment of a dysregulated network of cyto-
kines, fibroblasts are likely to be transformed into myofi-
broblasts, and the central feature of these cells in the
activated state is the acquisition of α-smooth muscle
fibrin [14, 15]. In healthy mucosa, MFs are absent from
the epithelial and stromal cell populations. In OSCC, the
stroma contains MFs among the malignant epithelial
cells, which regulate the proliferation and apoptosis of
the epithelia. In advanced oral submucous fibrosis
(OSF), MFs are subjacent to the epithelium and secrete
collagen I [16, 17]. In cyclosporine A-induced gingival
overgrowth and hereditary gingival fibromatosis of con-
nective tissue, intense α-SMA staining is observed, and
MFs contribute to fibrosis by secreting several inflam-
matory cytokines [18, 19]. MFs are a rich source of che-
mokines, cytokines, and extracellular matrix (ECM)
proteins, which are involved in neoplasms and some in-
flammatory processes. The dynamic role of MFs in
OSCC, OLK and OSF has been reported in previous
studies [10]. However, no evidence exists of a relation-
ship between MFs and OLP.
The original morphologic characterization of myofi-
broblasts by electron microscopy showed them to have
numerous
well-formed
cytoskeletal
microfilaments.
These microfilaments were subsequently found to be
composed of actin filaments and smooth muscle “spe-
cific” actin. The presence of actin stress fibers was simi-
lar to that seen in smooth muscle cells, but these cells
also retained typical fibroblast features [20].
A large body of evidence suggests that gingival fibro-
blasts can react to various stimuli by releasing cytokines
and chemokines, which ultimately play important roles
in the inflammatory response [21].
We hypothesized that OLP fibroblasts are transformed
into myofibroblasts and contribute to the inflammatory
process in OLP lesions.
Materials and methods
Specimens
The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the
Stomatology Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University,
(No. KY2017019, Guangzhou 510,140, China). Informed
consent was obtained from each patient. Sections of human
mucosa (n = 5) were obtained from mucosa discarded dur-
ing biopsies. Normal healthy mucosa was obtained from
samples discarded during plastic surgery at the Stomatology
Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University.
Patients were eligible for inclusion if they (1) were be-
tween 18 and 50 years old and (2) had a diagnosis con-
sistent with erosive OLP without epithelial dysplasia.
Patients were excluded if they (1) had severe systemic
diseases, (2) received antibiotics or other medicines in
the previous 4 weeks, or (3) had other oral mucosal dis-
eases. Patient information for the OLP and normal spec-
imens is shown in Table 1.
Primary culture
Freshly resected specimens were washed with sterile
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (BOSTER, AR0030, CA)
containing 10% penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine (100X)
(Gibco, 10,378,016, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) before
being minced into 1-mm3 fragments. These fragments
were cultured in DMEM medium (Gibco, Thermo Fisher
Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (10,099,141, Gibco) at 37 °C with
5% CO2. This medium was used for carcinoma-associated
fibroblasts (CAFs) and NFs [22–24]. Cultured cells at pas-
sages 3–6 were used.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
The samples were rinsed with PBS and fixed overnight in
3% glutaraldehyde at 4 °C. Next, the samples were dehy-
drated using the following ethanol gradient: 30, 50, 70, 95,
and 100%. Then, the samples were dehydrated with xylene
and air-dried at room temperature. Subsequently, the
specimens were coated with gold and examined by SEM
(HITACHI-S-3400 N, Hitachi High-Technologies Corpor-
ation, Tokyo, Japan). The obtained images were processed
using Adobe Photoshop CS6 software (Adobe Systems
Inc., San Jose, CA, USA).
Immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry
Immunohistochemistry: Mucosal sections were processed
for histology. The Diva Decloaker reagent was used for
antigen retrieval in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
tissues. α-SMA and vimentin were detected with mono-
clonal rabbit anti-α-SMA (ab32575, Abcam, Cambridge,
MA) (1:300) and anti-vimentin (ab92547, Abcam) (1:300),
followed by treatment with goat anti-rabbit IgG H&L
(HRP, ab6721, Abcam) and diaminobenzidine.
Immunocytochemistry: Primary cells were seeded on
glass coverslips in six-well plates. At least five randomly

selected visual fields of the immunostained cells were
examined under a light microscope (Leica, DM4000,
Tokyo, Japan). The obtained images were compiled
using Adobe Photoshop CS6 software.
Immunofluorescence
staining
was
performed
on
paraffin-embedded sections of normal and diseased
human oral mucosal specimens. Rabbit polyclonal anti-
bodies to CD31 (ab28364, Abcam) (1:25) or mouse
monoclonal antibodies to
α-SMA (ab7817, Abcam)
(1:200) were applied overnight, followed by incubation
with goat anti-rabbit Cy2 (111–225-144, Jackson Immu-
noResearch, West Grove, PA) or a mouse monoclonal
antibody to α-SMA (ab205719, Abcam) (1:250), respect-
ively. Cells were examined with a fluorescence (Leica,
DM4000, Instruments, Melville, NY) or confocal (Leica,
tcssp8, NY) microscope.
Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
RNA was harvested from primary cultures established
from five different buccal mucosa samples using the
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol and reverse transcribed
into first-strand cDNA with the gDNA eraser (RR047A,
TAKARA) transcription system. RT-PCR was performed
with SYBR® Premix Ex Taq™II (TAKARA, RR820A)
using a Bio-Rad system, and GAPDH and β-actin were
used as internal controls. Gene expression was quanti-
fied relative to the internal controls. All primers are
listed in Table 2. The experiments were repeated a total
of three times.
Western blotting
Primary cells were lysed with RIPA buffer and a proteinase
inhibitor
mixture
(PMSF).
Nuclear
and
cytoplasmic
proteins were separated using a nuclear and cytoplasm
protein extraction kit (78,833, Thermo Pierce, Rockford,
IL, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The protein concentration was assessed using a Multiskan
instrument (Thermo, Multiskan Mk3). Total proteins
were electrophoresed on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and trans-
ferred onto polyscreen PVDF transfer membranes (Immo-
bilon-P PVDF Membrane, Merck Millipore). Membranes
were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat milk in Tris-buffered
saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room
temperature
and
incubated
overnight
with
primary
anti-α-SMA (ab32575, Abcam) (1:5000), anti-vimentin
(ab92547, Abcam) (1:5000), anti-TLR2 (ab16894, Abcam)
(1:1000) and anti-TLR4 (ab22048, Abcam) (1:1000) at 4 °C.
After washing, an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody
was added for 1 h at 37 °C. Detection was performed with
enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL), and blots were
quantified by densitometry using the accompanying
computerized image analysis program (Image Tool).
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation
Cells grown in 12-well plates (5.0 × 104 cells/well) were
treated with the Toll-like receptor ligand pg. LPS (Invivo-
gen) at a concentration of 10 ng/ml for 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 or
48 h, and the corresponding supernatants were collected.
PBS was used as a control.
Human 9-plex assay
Conditioned media samples of LPS-treated cells were sub-
mitted in triplicate for Human 9-Plex assay testing to the
USC Beckman Center Immune Monitoring Core Lab.
Secreted cytokines and chemokines were analyzed with
the Bio-Plex suspension array system (Bio-Rad Laborator-
ies, Hercules, CA) using a Q-Plex Human 9-Plex Kit
(110449HU, Quansys Biosciences, USA) to evaluate IL-1α,
IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IFN-γ, and TNF-α con-
centrations. Experiments were repeated a total of three
times.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and
cytokine assay
Conditioned media samples from treated cells were col-
lected, passed through a 0.45-μm filter to remove cell
debris, aliquoted, and frozen at −20 °C. An ELISA Kit
(Abcam, ab46042, UK) was used to evaluate IL-6 concen-
trations at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h, according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Cytokine levels in each sam-
ple were determined based on a standard curve generated
by the recombinant proteins provided with the kits.
Statistical analysis
The data were analyzed using Prism statistical software
(GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Differences among
groups were assessed using a two-sided Student’s test or
repeated measures one-way ANOVA, as appropriate.
The results are expressed as means±SEM. *** P < 0.01;

Results
OLP buccal mucosa contains stromal cells expressing
α-SMA
Immunostaining demonstrated expression of α-SMA in
spindle-shaped cells adjacent to the OLP mucosal epi-
thelium (Fig. 1a), which was not found in normal buccal
mucosa (Fig. 1b). α-SMA expression was also observed
in endothelial cells forming blood vessels.
To determine whether the α-SMA expression was in
MFs or endothelial cells, we performed immunostaining for
α-SMA and CD31. Each DAPI-stained nucleus was evalu-
ated for expression of α-SMA and CD31. Confocal micros-
copy demonstrated that in OLP mucosa, spindle-shaped
cells
around
the
basement
membrane
occasionally
expressed the MF marker α-SMA (Fig. 1c). Endothelial cells
forming blood vessels were also α-SMA+ and were distin-
guished from spindle-shaped cells by their circular config-
uration
and
the
specific
endothelial
marker
CD31.
Immunofluorescence of normal mucosa did not show
α-SMA staining near the squamous epithelium (Fig. 1d).
Primary cultured OLP AFs express α-SMA in vitro
After plating, the heterogeneous cells adhered to the
bottom of the plate (Fig. 2a). Adherent mucosal stromal
cells retained a spindle-shaped morphology (Fig. 2b).
Proliferating cells from the OLP region were large and
polygonal in shape (Fig. 2c) and the cells from NF group
present long and thin spindle shape (Fig. 2d). Bundles of
packed fibrils resembling smooth muscle developed
within the cytoplasm and were usually arranged parallel
to the axis of the cell (Fig. 2e).
Immunohistochemical staining for intracellular cytoskel-
etal proteins demonstrated that OLP mucosal stromal cells
in primary culture coexpressed α-SMA and vimentin
(Fig. 3a and b); primary cultured cells from normal mucosa
lacked α-SMA but expressed vimentin (Fig. 3c and d).
Fig. 3 OLP mucosal stromal cells in primary culture coexpress α-SMA and vimentin (a and b). Primary cultured cells from normal mucosa lacked
α-SMA expression but expressed vimentin (c and d). Expression of α-SMA and vimentin mRNA harvested from AF and NF was evaluated by quantitative
RT-PCR. mRNA expression of α-SMA from AF was significantly higher than that of NF. Vimentin expression showed no significant difference between the
groups (p = 0.471) (e). Western blot analysis performed with total cellular proteins from NF and AF clones. AF expressed high levels of α-SMA, whereas
fibroblast clones lacked expression. NF and AF showed no significant difference in vimentin expression. GAPDH was used as an internal control (f)

The relative mRNA expression of α-SMA in OLP AFs
was significantly higher than in NFs (*** P < 0.01), whereas
no significant difference in vimentin was observed be-
tween the OLP AFs and NFs (P = 0.221) (Fig. 3e) Immu-
noblot suggested that AFs express higher α-SMA levels
than NFs (Fig. 3f).
Increased secretion of inflammation-related cytokines by
OLP AFs in response to LPS stimulation
Human 9-Plex cytokine/chemokine screening demon-
strated a continuous increase in the secretion of IL-6,
IL-8, and TNF-α from 0 to 8 h after pg. LPS stimulation
(Fig. 4a). The expression began to significantly decline at
12 h, and no difference was found at the 48-h time point
compared to 0 h. Statistically significant decreases in
IL-1β and IL-10 were detectable after 2 and 4 h (Fig. 4b).
No significant differences were detected in IL-1-α, IL-2,
IL-4, and IFN-γ at any timepoint in response to pg. LPS
stimulation (Fig. 4c).
IL-6 was detected in OLP AF- and control-conditioned
media using ELISA. IL-6 was continuously increased,
and significant differences in IL-6 were observed between
OLP AF- and control-conditioned media at 4, 8, and 12 h
(Fig. 4d).
Four hours after LPS stimulation, we observed a sig-
nificant increase in IL-6 in OLP AF-conditioned media
(Table 3). Maximal IL-6 expression occurred after 8 h,
with a nearly 250-fold increase compared to the level at
0 h, which began to significantly decline at 12 h com-
pared to the concentration at 4 h.
Discussion
OLP is a chronic inflammatory condition that involves the
oral mucosal stratified squamous epithelium and the
underlying lamina propria. The prevailing theories of OLP
pathogenesis revolve around dysregulated T cell responses
to exogenous triggers vs. a dysregulated autoimmune
response to autologous keratinocyte antigens [25].
Nonspecific inflammation is a type of chronic inflam-
mation that exhibits three main characteristics: (1) in-
flammatory cell infiltration; (2) tissue destruction; and
(3) a repair response [26]. We consider OLP to be a
model of nonspecific inflammation due to the following
pathological and micrographic features: (1) liquefaction
and degeneration of basal epithelial cells and band
infiltration of superficial lymphocytes in the lamina pro-
pria [27]; (2) inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α,
and MMPs that potentially cause a disordered arrange-
ment of epithelial basal cells and the fracture of
junctions between the stratum basale and basement
membrane
[28];
and
(3)
an
increased
number
of
Langerhans cells and mast cells in OLP lesions [29]. Al-
though a large number of literatures have shown that
pro-inflammatory cytokines are increased in OLP le-
sions, saliva and serum, its mechanism is still unclear.
Myofibroblasts are a highly specialized set of differ-
entiated cells that play a prominent role during the
body’s response to injury but can also contribute
pathologically
to
inflammatory
conditions
such
as
fibrosis and cancer [30]. A key feature of myofibro-
blasts is expression of α-SMA.With improved diag-
nostics, lineage tracing studies, and genetic tools, a
number of myofibroblast precursors have been identi-
fied, including fibroblasts, epithelial and endothelial
cells via epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT),
resident mesenchymal progenitor cells,adipose tissue
cells, and bone-marrow-derived circulating fibrocytes .
[31] In previous studies, immunohistochemical obser-
vations demonstrated no expression of α-SMA in the
epithelium and subepithelial tissue of and OLP mu-
cosa, whether there are MFs located in OLP lesion is
controversial.We immunostained the protein maker
α-SMA and find that OLP buccal mucosa contains
stromal cells expressing α-SMA.To identify these stro-
mal cells, Immunohistochemical staining was used
combined with observation of the morphology of the
isolated cells.
Recently, several studies have suggested that micro-
organisms may trigger or be responsible for sustaining
or exacerbating the chronic course of OLP [32–34].
Epithelial barrier dysfunction may precede intracellu-
lar infection of basal epithelial cells with bacteria,
virus, or possibly fungus. In contrast to patients with
oral mucosa and periodontal health, the expression of
periodontitis related bacteria including porphyromo-
nas gingivalis increased in the saliva of OLP patients
and was positively correlated with the severity scor-
e.So We treated cells by LPS from P. gingivalis and
Elisa to detect the Soluble cytokines in the collected

supernatant. We found that LPS from P. gingivalis con-
tributes to the over-production of pro-inflammatory
cytokines in vitro, which may represent new evidence
for the potential roles of microbial factors in the patho-
genesis of OLP.
ILs are a group of cytokines with multiple roles in
nearly all aspects of inflammation and immunity, includ-
ing immune cell proliferation, differentiation, maturation
and activation [35]. IL-6, IL8 and TNF-α are mainly
secreted by antigen-presenting cells, including dendritic
cells, macrophages and B cells, but are also expressed by
a variety of nonimmune cells. Increases in IL-6, IL8 and
TNF-α expression have been reported previously in OLP
lesions and serum, especially the erosive forms [8].
There is no credible evidence can prove that the fibro-
blasts from OLP secret pro-inflammatory cytokines.-
According to our results,fibroblast from the normal
buccal secret feebler pro-inflammatory cytokines than
myofibroblast. In the model of microbial infection estab-
lished in vitro, what cellular mechanism of pg.lps
induces MFB to produce and release pro-inflammatory
cytokines is be worth searching.
Conclusion
1. A subset of fibroblasts in OLP lesions are
transformed into myofibroblasts.
2. OLP AFs secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines in
response to microorganismal infection.
