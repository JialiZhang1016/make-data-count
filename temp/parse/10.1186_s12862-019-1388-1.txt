slow-developing but not long-lived

Abstract
Background: Variation in body size is thought to be a major driver of a wide variety of ecological and evolutionary
patterns, including changes in development, reproduction, and longevity. Additionally, drastic changes in natural
context often have profound effects on multiple fitness-related traits. Caenorhabditis inopinata is a recently-discovered
fig-associated nematode that is unusually large relative to other members of the genus, including the closely related
model system C. elegans. Here we test whether the dramatic increase in body size and shift in ecological context has
led to correlated changes in key life history and developmental parameters within this species.
Results: Using four developmental milestones, C. inopinata was found to have a slower rate of development than C.
elegans across a range of temperatures. Despite this, C. inopinata did not reveal any differences in adult lifespan from
C. elegans after accounting for differences in developmental timing and reproductive mode. C. inopinata fecundity
was generally lower than that of C. elegans, but fitness improved under continuous-mating, consistent with sperm-
limitation under gonochoristic (male/female) reproduction. C. inopinata also revealed greater fecundity and viability
at higher temperatures.
Conclusion: Consistent with observations in other ectotherms, slower growth in C. inopinata indicates a potential
trade-off between body size and developmental timing, whereas its unchanged lifespan suggests that longevity
is largely uncoupled from its increase in body size. Additionally, temperature-dependent patterns of fitness in C.
inopinata are consistent with its geographic origins in subtropical Okinawa. Overall, these results underscore the
extent to which changes in ecological context and body size can shape life history traits.

Background
Trade-offs dominate life history evolution. Organisms have
access to limited energy resources, and these must be
allocated in a balance between self-maintenance and repro-
ductive output. In keeping with the expectation that differ-
ent distributions of life history traits (such as age of
maturity, reproductive duration, and age-specific fecundity,
among others) should be sensitive to different distributions
of selective pressures on those traits, a huge diversity of
patterns among life history traits has emerged across the
broad scope of animal diversity [1–5]. As a consequence,
many organisms exhibit well-documented correlations
among traits such as fecundity and survival [6–8], fecund-
ity and developmental rate [1, 9–11], and reproductive
quantity and quality [12, 13].
Body size is a particularly potent component of life
history syndromes. Body size is usually correlated with a
multitude of fitness-related traits including developmen-
tal rate, offspring number, offspring size, gamete size,
and lifespan [14–17]. Body size is also known to covary
with physiological traits, such as metabolic rate, thought
to underlie trade-offs among life history traits [15, 17].
These factors in turn generate allometric relationships
that appear to explain scale-based trends for a wide var-
iety of traits across many orders of magnitude [15].
Indeed, body size appears to be a central component of
broad macroevolutionary trends among lineages over
geological timescales [18]. But which is cause and which
is effect? To what extent does change in body size due
to selection on body size per se lead to collected changes
in such a wide array of life history traits and to what ex-
tent does body size change because of selection acting
directly on these traits?

Life history theory suggests that selection for increased
body size can be balanced against the benefits of faster
reproduction and the costs of lower offspring viability
and lower initial fecundity [1], weighed against a back-
drop of differential allocation of physiological and meta-
bolic resources to each of these processes and to growth
itself [17, 19]. At the same time, selection on body size
itself must be mediated via environmental factors such
as resource availability and/or predation [20]. Although
these various causes are not mutually exclusive and
likely overlap, the proximate and ultimate causes of body
size change—particularly the relationship between these
two—remain largely unresolved.
However, body size is not the only factor known to in-
fluence life history traits—environmental and ecological
change is also expected to promote life history evolution.
Indeed, whenever a change in environment impacts the
optimal survival and fecundity of different age classes,
then life histories will evolve in response [21]. Changes
in both abiotic (temperature, salinity, humidity, etc.) and
biotic (predation pressure, resource abundance, pollin-
ator density, etc.) environments can impact life history
strategies: for instance, differential predation on larval
stages in guppies due to spatial differences in predator
abundance promoted changes in reproductive effort
across populations [21, 22]. Furthermore, the extent of
regularity in temporal environments (such as season
length) is thought to underlie bet-hedging strategies
(such as the germination time decision), and life histor-
ies are expected to evolve in response to changes in the
timing of environmental cycles as well [21]. Thus, envir-
onmental and ecological context plays a critical role in
the evolution of life histories. How do changes in eco-
logical context interact with the constraints imposed by
body size to promote the evolution of life history traits?
The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has for decades
been an important model for genetics, development, and
biology in general [23]. However, the degree and extent
of trade-offs between body size and other life history
traits in systems like C. elegans remain largely unknown
and/or
have
generated
somewhat
ambiguous
or
contradictory results [24–32]. Further, because nearly all
known members of this genus share a common natural
ecological niche of rotting plant material [33], it has not
been possible to use a comparative approach to investi-
gate how change in ecological circumstances might drive
changes in the relationship between body size and life
history [19]. Here, we address this question by taking
advantage of a highly phenotypically and ecologically
divergent close relative of C. elegans: the recently discov-
ered fig-associated nematode C. inopinata.
C. inopinata (formerly known as C. sp. 34) is remark-
able in that it displays tremendous ecological and pheno-
typic differences compared to its close relatives [34, 35].
Compared to other Caenorhabditis, C. inopinata is huge:
it can grow to be nearly twice as long as other members in
the genus [34, 35]. C. inopinata also develops nearly half
as quickly, has sperm three times the size, and embryos
20% longer than C. elegans [35]. Furthermore, in contrast
to the rotting-plant material ecological niche of C. elegans
and other Caenorhabditis species [36], it thrives in the
fresh, intact Okinawan figs of Ficus septica [34, 35, 37]. C.
inopinata thus appears to have experienced a radically
different selective environment that has led to its highly
divergent suite of life history traits. And, as C. inopinata is
much larger in size and develops much more slowly than
its close relatives, it can therefore be used as a natural sys-
tem to test the predictions of life history theory using a
comparative approach. Here, we do just this by describing
the developmental timing, lifespan, fecundity, and viability
of C. inopinata and C. elegans at multiple temperatures.
Results
C. inopinata develops more slowly yet does not differ
from C. elegans in lifespan and reproductive duration
Initial measures of developmental rate revealed that C.
inopinata develops at about half the rate as C. elegans
[35]. To provide a more complete picture of the timing
of development in this species, the occurrence of four
different developmental milestones (time of hatching,
onset of the L4 stage, onset of adulthood, and the onset
of
reproduction)
was
ascertained
at
four
different
temperatures (15°C, 20°C,
25°C, and
30°C) among
synchronized populations of C. elegans and C. inopinata.
Unsurprisingly, all species grew faster as the temperature
increased (Fig. 1; Additional file 1: Table S1). Yet in con-
ditions where both species grew reliably, C. inopinata
was slower to reach all developmental milestones than
C. elegans (Fig. 1; Additional file 1: Table S1). Indeed, at
the typical rearing temperature of C. elegans (20°C),
the median time of reproductive onset was 2.7 days in
C. elegans, whereas it was 6.7 days in C. inopinata
(Generalized linear model likelihood ratio test (GLM
LRT) chi-square=4861.4, df=2, p<0.0001). To reach a
developmental rate that approaches that of C. elegans
at 20°C, C. inopinata must be reared at a temperature
that is ten degrees higher (Fig. 1b; Additional file 1:
Table S1) where it exhibits reduced fecundity (Fig. 4a)
and where C. elegans N2 is inviable (Fig. 5). Overall,
then, C. inopinata has slower relative growth regard-
less of temperature.
As slow developing, large animals tend to be longer-
lived [1], we were curious if C. inopinata also exhibits
prolonged longevity. To address this, we applied previ-
ously established methods of lifespan measurement in
nematodes [38] to C. inopinata. As a point of comparison,
we also measured C. elegans N2 and C. elegans (fog-2; for
Feminization Of Germline) lifespans. As lifespan often

trades-off with reproductive output [39, 40], we used
virgin C. elegans (fog-2) pseudo-females (which do not
generate self-sperm and are self-sterile as a conse-
quence [41]) to control for differences in reproductive
mode. C. inopinata females were longer-lived than
wild-type C. elegans hermaphrodites at 25°C, with a
median total lifespan that was four days higher (20 and
16, respectively; Cox proportional hazards linear model
comparison, Z-value=4.99, p<0.0001 Fig. 2a; Additional
file 1: Figure S1). However, C. inopinata females were
only marginally longer lived than C. elegans (fog-2)
pseudo-females (19 days, Cox proportional hazards
linear model comparison, Z-value=2.29, p=0.053). Fur-
thermore, no differences in adult lifespan (which takes
into account the differences in developmental timing
between C. elegans and C. inopinata) were detected
between C. inopinata females (median adult lifespan of
16 days) and C. elegans (fog-2) pseudo-females (median
adult lifespan of 17 days; Cox proportional hazards lin-
ear model comparison, Z-value=0.74, p=0.73; Fig. 2b;
Additional file 1: Figure S2). Thus, despite its large size
and slow development, C. inopinata adults are not
longer-lived than C. elegans after accounting for differ-
ences in reproductive mode and developmental timing.
The duration of reproduction is also expected to
trade-off with growth rate and body size [1, 2], with large,
slow-developing
animals
tending
to
have
longer
reproductive periods [9–11]. To see if this also holds for
C. inopinata, daily measures of fecundity were made
with individual C. elegans (fog-2) pseudo-females and
C. inopinata females under conditions of continuous
mating throughout their lifetimes (Fig. 3). Although one
individual C. inopinata female had a reproductive duration
of twelve days, for the most part, both species lay almost
all of their embryos in the first four days of adulthood
(Fig. 3b). Indeed, under continuous mating conditions at

25°C, no differences in brood fraction per day could be de-
tected between C. inopinata and C. elegans with the ex-
ception of day eight of adulthood (Wilcoxon rank sum
test, W=528, p=0.041). Thus, like lifespan, duration of
reproduction is not extended in C. inopinata.
C. inopinata is sperm-limited and reveals higher fitness at
higher temperatures
Brood size also tends to covary with both body size and
developmental rate [1, 2], and so fecundity was measured
at four different temperatures in C. inopinata and C.

elegans (fog-2) to address if similar patterns hold in this
group (Fig. 4). In conditions in which females were mated
with males for just one night, C. inopinata generally dis-
played far smaller brood sizes than C. elegans (fog-2), with
the exception that C. elegans (fog-2) is infertile at 30°C
(Fig. 4a). However, as the male/female species C. remanei
is known to generate more progeny when constantly ex-
posed to males [42, 43], we suspected that C. inopinata
might also be sperm-limited. Indeed, under continuous
mating conditions, there is no detectable difference in
brood size between C. inopinata and C. elegans (fog-2)
(median brood size of 58 and 76, respectively; Wilcoxon
rank sum test, W=484 p=0.62; Fig. 4b). However, male
mating performance tends to degrade in selfing species
[44], so we also compared the fraction of successful crosses
between C. elegans and C. inopinata (Additional file 1:
Figure S3). In continuous mating conditions, the fraction
of failed crosses was higher in C. elegans (0.33, N=30
crosses) than in C. inopinata (0.17, N=30 crosses),
although this difference was not statistically significant
(Fisher’s Exact Test odds ratio=2.46, p=0.23). After removing
animals that failed to produce progeny, C. elegans (fog-2)
yielded a median brood size that is over twice as large
as that of C. inopinata in continuous mating conditions
(145 and 65, respectively; Wilcoxon rank sum test, W=359,
p=0.013; Additional file 1: Figure S4). Thus C. inopinata
requires constant access to mates in order to maximize its
reproductive output, consistent with its gonochoristic mode
of reproduction.
When examining the relationship between develop-
mental rate and fecundity, the intrinsic rate of increase
(r) is likely a better measure of fitness than total fecund-
ity (R0) [1, 45]. Under this approach, fitness is a function
of age-specific fecundity and viability, and the age of first
reproduction can highly influence the population growth
rate [1]. So although C. inopinata and C. elegans have
comparable brood sizes under continuous mating condi-
tions, they likely differ in fitness because of their different
developmental rates. Indeed, despite their comparable
brood sizes, C. elegans has a rate of increase (r=1.54, 95%
confidence interval (CI)=1.26-1.72) that is over twice as
high as C. inopinata (r=0.66, 95% CI=0.54-0.74). This
difference in fitness is even greater in mating conditions
with just overnight access to males (C. elegans r=2.09, 95%
CI=1.88-2.24; C. inopinata r=0.63, 95% CI=0.55-0.69).
Thus continuous access to males is not sufficient to over-
come the detriment to fitness due to slow development in
C. inopinata.
In keeping with the other life-history measures, C.
elegans was more viable at lower temperatures and C.
inopinata more viable at higher temperatures during early
development (Fig. 5). Overall, however, C. inopinata
displayed consistently lower embryo-to-adult viability than
C. elegans at 15°C, 20°C, and 25°C (Wilcoxon rank sum
test p<0.001 in all comparisons; Fig. 5). No detectable
differences in C. inopinata viability were found between
20°C, 25°C, and 30°C (median viability of 0.84, 0.79, and
0.88, respectively; Wilcoxon rank sum test W=50 p=0.060,
W=70 p=0.62; Fig.5), but C. inopinata is less viable at 15°C
(median viability of 0.63; Wilcoxon rank sum test
p≤0.030 for all comparisons). As C. inopinata fecundity
is also higher at warmer temperatures (Fig. 4a), these
temperature-specific fitness patterns are consistent with
its subtropical natural context of fresh Okinawan
Ficus septica figs.
Most C. elegans genes with life history phenotypes
conventionally associated with large body size intersect
with only one phenotype
Life history syndromes are often thought to be driven by
trade-offs resulting from antagonistic pleiotropy [46].
How often are pleiotropic effects observed in life history
traits in C. elegans? The C. elegans genomic database
WormBase [47] has collected gene-specific information
regarding the biological consequences of mutation and
RNAi exposure as “phenotype” terms, which constitute a
formal ontology used to describe phenotypes associated

with genes [48]. To explore the extent of pleiotropy
underlying life history syndromes in C. elegans, we
measured the amount of overlap among four WormBase
database phenotypes that resemble life history traits as-
sociated with large body size (“long,” “extended life
span,” “reduced brood size,” and “slow growth”) in C.
elegans protein-coding genes (Fig. 6). As previously
shown [49], most C. elegans protein-coding genes do not
have any reported phenotypes (42% or 8,585/20,209).
14% of C. elegans protein-coding genes (2,908/20,209)
had at least one of the four life history phenotypes. Of
these, the vast majority (74% or 2,159/2,908) intersected
with only one of the four phenotypes (Fig. 6). This sug-
gests that these traits are potentially largely genetically
decoupled in this system and that pleiotropy need not
underlie the evolution of life history strategies.
Discussion
Possibly because it is both obvious and easy to measure,
body size variation has been studied extensively for cen-
turies. The range in body size across the tree of life is so
immense as to demand explanation (21 orders of
magnitude [16, 50]), and this incredible diversity has
spawned a vast and rich literature attempting to compre-
hend its origins and maintenance. One major conclusion
from this research program is that body size is correlated
with nearly every trait, such that long-established rela-
tionships between body size and growth, reproduction,
and lifespan underscore a prominent role for body size in

the evolution of life histories [14, 15, 50]. Here, we found
that an exceptionally large and ecologically divergent close
relative of C. elegans exhibits slow growth and low fecund-
ity across a range of temperatures yet is not long lived.
Together with the extensive C. elegans literature and the
foundations of life history theory, these observations can
contribute to our understanding of the causes and conse-
quences of large-scale changes in body size and ecological
divergence.
The impact of ecological divergence on life history
syndromes
Changes in ecological context are expected to impact life
history traits. Here, we described the life history traits of
C. inopinata, an organism that occupies an exceptional
ecological niche when compared with its close relatives.
Most Caenorhabditis species, including C. elegans, thrive
in rotting plant material [36]. C. inopinata proliferates in
fresh F. septica figs, living in close association with its
pollinating fig wasps [34, 37]. How might this dramatic
shift in ecological context explain the patterns of life his-
tory traits observed here?
C. inopinata grows at nearly half the rate as C. elegans
(Fig. 1). One possible explanation for the divergence in
developmental rate could be its novel natural context.
Most Caenorhabditis proliferate in the ephemeral envi-
ronments of rotting vegetation [36]; it is thought that
the rapid turnover and spatial patchiness of its bacterial
food resources has driven its rapid development, high
fecundity, and its resource-dependent decision to enter
the dispersal dauer larval stage [51]. C. inopinata, con-
versely, grows in the presumably more stable environ-
ment of the fig lumen and obligately disperses on
pollinating fig wasps [34, 37]. Figs generally take weeks
to develop [52], although it is unclear how many genera-
tions of worms occur within a single fig. It is then
possible that the extreme divergence in developmental
rate might be connected to differences in the transience
of resource availability between these environments. Fur-
thermore, as C. inopinata animals disperse to new figs
via pollinating wasps [37], their life cycle is necessarily
closely tied to patterns of wasp development and emer-
gence, consistent with correlations among Ceratosolen
fig wasp and C. inopinata developmental stages that
have been found in previous field studies [37]. This con-
trasts with C. elegans and its other close relatives, who
disperse on a plethora of invertebrate carriers (including
isopods, myriapods, and gastropods) [53]. Future longi-
tudinal field studies of single fig trees at finer temporal
resolution will be required to determine the relative
paces of fig, fig wasp, and nematode development in
nature and to test hypotheses regarding the ecological
drivers of heterochrony.
Overall, C. inopinata reveals a lower viability (Fig. 5)
and fecundity (Fig. 4) than C. elegans in laboratory condi-
tions, although lifetime access to males greatly improves
C. inopinata fecundity (Fig. 4b). How might its unique
ecology underlie these patterns? A particularly interesting
avenue to pursue is based on the observation that wild
bacteria associated with Caenorhabditis can have both
positive or negative influences on fecundity and growth
[54, 55] and that different species of Caenorhabditis are
associated with different microbes in nature [54]. Thus
the nutritional environment can have a profound effect on
fitness and life history traits. The natural microbial food of
C. inopinata is currently unknown. As C. inopinata
exhibits reduced gonads in laboratory culture [35], it may
be experiencing nutritional deficiencies. The reduced fe-
cundity of C. inopinata may then reflect a plastic response
to an adverse environment as opposed to a trade-off with
increased body size. The potential influence of natural
microbial associates of Ficus septica figs on C. inopinata
fitness affords an exciting opportunity for future research.
Fig. 6 Intersection of relevant life history trait phenotypes in C. elegans
protein-coding genes. In C. elegans, many genes that can increase body
length, slow development, extend lifespan, or reduce fecundity when
defective do not also promote correlated changes in life history traits
often associated with increased body size. Matrix layout plot shows
intersections of C. elegans genes among four WormBase phenotype
terms [48] (“long,” “extended life span,” “reduced brood size,” “slow
growth”; plot generated in R with the UpSetR package [86]). Most genes
intersect with only one phenotype (the first, second, fourth, and sixth
columns from the left), whereas only four genes display all four
phenotypes. Most protein-coding genes in C. elegans do not have any
reported phenotypes (also see analysis in [49]). See methods for
more details.

The large body size of C. inopinata could also be more
directly connected to its novel environmental context.
Body size is broadly correlated with fecundity across
nematode phylogeny [56–58], and the fig microcosm may
represent an environment with less selective pressure on
body size than rotting vegetation. Hence C. inopinata may
be large because its ecological context reveals relaxed
selection on body size compared to its close relatives.
Such pressures may entail predation or pathogens—vari-
ous mites, fungi, bacteria, and viruses are known to prey
on or infect Caenorhabditis [53]. Figs maintain many
defenses against antagonistic invertebrates and microor-
ganisms [59–61], and it is likely that this environment
harbors a less diverse community than rotting vegetation.
In this case any trade-offs among predation or infection
avoidance and body size would be lifted, facilitating body
size change resulting from selection on increased fecund-
ity. However, within C. elegans, no evidence for correla-
tions between body size and fecundity was found after
artificial selection for large body size [25]. Thus it is
entirely possible that such trade-offs are not driving body
size change in this case and that other factors (adaptive or
not) are responsible upon shifting to the fig environment.
Further studies explicitly addressing the possible eco-
logical determinants of body size change will be needed to
delineate these possibilities.
Developmental timing and body size
It makes intuitive sense that larger organisms should de-
velop more slowly. Being more massive, presumably more
cell divisions and/or biosynthetic reactions must take place
for their construction and it therefore follows that their de-
velopment should take longer than smaller organisms. And
this intuition bears out across vast phylogenetic distances:
from bacteria to sequoias, body size covaries with gener-
ation time [50]. Here, we found that in all temperatures, C.
inopinata grows nearly half as quickly as C. elegans,
consistent with previous observations (Fig. 1; [34, 35]).
Indeed, C. inopinata needs to be grown at 30°C to
approach a rate of development comparable to that of C.
elegans when grown at 20°C. Thus, the observation that
this very large species also develops much more slowly
than its close relatives is in line with decades of allometric
studies. Further, as cell size is coordinated with cell division
decisions in multiple organisms [62, 63], body size change
could occur even in the absence of cell number change
through the modification of cell cycle timing. This may
explain the case of C. inopinata, as previous observations
observed no change in cell number despite its large size
and slow development [35].
However, there are reasons to suspect slow development
may not underlie large body size in this case. It has been
argued that the allometric trends observed in birds and
mammals cannot be easily extended to poikilotherms
because of difficulties in comparing physiological time due
to rapid change in metabolic rates [16]. More notable is
the common observation that developmental timing can
be decoupled from body size in C. elegans. Most muta-
tions in C. elegans that extend body length do not also
slow the rate of growth: only 29% of the genes in the C.
elegans genome known to control body length also
promote slower development (Fig. 6). Furthermore, ex-
perimental evolution and mutation accumulation studies
in C. elegans and C. briggsae have not generally reported
correlated changes in body size and developmental timing
[25, 27, 28, 64]. Thus, it appears that body size and rate of
growth need not be strongly coupled in Caenorhabditis
and that the relationship between these traits observed
in
C.
inopinata
may
not
necessarily
be
causative.
Furthermore, as mentioned above, the slow growth of
C. inopinata may also be better understood with respect
to its natural ecological context (or could also be due to
nutritional deficiencies in a laboratory context); framing
the causes of heterochronic change with respect to this
context is an exciting avenue for future studies.
Reproduction and body size
The relationship between body size and reproduction
varies both within and between taxa. In birds and mam-
mals, larger species tend to have lower fecundities than
smaller species [15]. Conversely, body size appears to be
positively correlated with fecundity in insects [65] and
nematodes [56–58]. C. inopinata was generally found to
have lower brood sizes than C. elegans across a range of
temperatures (Fig. 4a), although continuous mating
greatly improves fecundity in C. inopinata (Fig. 4b). The
relatively low fecundity of C. inopinata is then incongruent
with patterns of fecundity and body size that have
been previously reported among nematodes [56–58].
C. inopinata’s gonochoristic mode of development cannot
explain its low brood size, as multiple male/female species
of Caenorhabditis have been reported to have higher
brood sizes [42, 43, 66–69]. However, the sperm-limited
fecundity of C. inopinata (Fig. 4b) is consistent with
previous observations with the gonochoristic C. remanei
[42, 43]. It is possible that the evolution of extreme body
size in the case of C. inopinata reveals a trade-off with re-
productive output, wherein resources usually allocated to
progeny have instead been shifted to increase self-main-
tenance and growth. Yet most genes known to regulate
body length in the C. elegans genome do not appear to
have a pleiotropic role in brood size (only 28% do; Fig. 6).
This is also consistent with experimental evolution studies
in Caenorhabditis [25], wherein fecundity and body size
do not necessarily trade-off. So again, the precise causal re-
lationship here bears further study. Additionally, as men-
tioned above, patterns of fecundity in C. inopinata may
Woodruff et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology           (2019) 19:74 
Page 8 of 14
also be better understood with respect to its natural envir-
onment. It is possible that C. inopinata may be experien-
cing nutritional deficiencies in the laboratory context, and
future studies with natural associated microbes will help to
inform this possibility.
Lifespan and body size
Lifespan is often positively correlated with body size, and
from an allometric perspective is usually thought to be
regulated by variation in developmental and metabolic rates
[15, 17]. And although the age of maturity is sensitive to
selection under a range of trait distributions in life history
theory [1], from an evolutionary perspective it is thought
that late-life traits are generally not subject to selection as
its strength falls to zero once reproduction ends [3].
Despite its large size and slow development, C. inopinata
was found to have only a marginally longer lifespan than
C. elegans (Fig. 2). And, when differences in developmental
timing and reproductive mode are taken into account,
C. inopinata adult lifespan is not significantly different
from that of C. elegans (Fig. 2b). The lack of lifespan change
in this system is consistent with the view that lifespan is
under weak selection, as C. inopinata has experienced dra-
matic change in many other traits under its novel eco-
logical context [34, 35, 37]. Indeed, most lifespan-extending
mutations identified in C. elegans have not been associated
with pleiotropic effects on body size (Fig. 6). Similarly, ex-
perimental evolution studies in C. elegans show no corre-
lated responses in lifespan upon artificial selection on early
fecundity [32] and body size [25]. Additionally, no relation-
ships between lifespan and fecundity have been found in
mutation-accumulation lines [24] or among wild isolates
[26]. These observations are inconsistent with the antagon-
istic pleiotropy explanation of aging, which posits that the
greater fitness contribution of early life survival and
reproduction leads to late life deterioration because of
negative genetic correlations of these traits [70]. Rather,
lifespan appears to be possibly largely uncoupled from
fitness-related traits in this group, consistent with the
unchanged longevity observed in C. inopinata. However,
the nutritional caveats in this system noted in the above
interpretation of observed patterns of fecundity also apply
here. It is possible that C. inopinata will be longer-lived
under different rearing conditions, and measurements of
lifespan of C. inopinata raised on bacterial food originating
from its natural context need to be performed.
Variation, inbreeding, and fitness-related traits
The observations reported here constitute comparisons
of two species with each represented by one genetic
strain. How does this fact impact the implications of this
work discussed here? From a comparative phylogenetics
perspective, this sample size is simply insufficient to
make broad generalizations about patterns of life history
trait covariation in the Caenorhabditis genus. It remains
possible that C. inopinata represents an outlier that
defies meaningful biological trends that we would other-
wise not capture because of our limited phylogenetic
sample. Furthermore, as we have only interrogated one
strain of C. inopinata, this strain may also not be repre-
sentative of this species as such. Ultimately, broad
sampling and measures across Caenorhabditis phylogeny
will be needed to make solid claims along these lines.
However, can previous observations of variation in
fitness-related traits in Caenorhabditis help to overcome
this limitation or better inform these results?
C. inopinata is an exceptional Caenorhabditis species
with respect to its large body size [34, 35], and most
members of the Elegans group are difficult to distin-
guish morphologically [71, 72]. But, as mentioned
above, there is variation both within and between
Caenorhabditis species in fecundity (Additional file 1:
Figures S5-S6; Additional file 2) and developmental
rate (Additional file 1: Figures S7-S8; Additional file 3).
Among four recent studies that measured fecundity in
Caenorhabditis (including this study) [38, 42, 73] ,
which includes 24 strains among four species, our esti-
mate of C. inopinata fecundity at 20°C is the lowest
(Additional file 1: Figures S5-S6). But as C. inopinata
and other gonochoristic Caenorhabditis are sperm-lim-
ited (Fig. 4) [42, 43], this is likely an underestimate of
its reproductive capacity. However, even limited access
to males can maintain brood sizes in C. remanei wild iso-
lates that exceed those observed in many strains of selfing
species (Additional file 1: Figures S5-S6) [42], including C.
elegans N2, which is considered a domesticated laboratory
strain [74]. With respect to previous studies of develop-
mental timing, C. inopinata is even more extreme in its
divergence from its close relatives, developing at about
half the rate as the next slowest strain (C. tropicalis
JU1630) among those considered in two previous publica-
tions (Additional file 1: Figures S7-S8) [38, 75]. Thus a
broader phylogenetic context with more Caenorhabditis
species and strains also suggests that this C. inopinata
strain harbors an exceptionally slow developmental rate
and a low (but sperm-limited) fecundity in addition to its
large body size.
Gonochoristic Caenorhabditis species are susceptible
to inbreeding depression [76, 77]. Could C. inopinata
strain NKZ2 have experienced inbreeding depression
during laboratory culture that impacts estimates of
fitness-related traits? This possibility cannot be defini-
tively ruled out, and an important caveat of these re-
sults is that inbreeding depression may influence the
patterns of life history traits observed here. However,
there are reasons to suspect inbreeding depression may
not be a major influencing factor in this case. Primarily,
Woodruff et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology           (2019) 19:74 
Page 9 of 14
C. inopinata NKZ2 is a wild isolate that has not been
deliberately inbred, and it is a strain derived from mul-
tiple founding individuals [35]. If inbreeding depression
were the only cause of declines in fitness-related traits,
then C. inopinata NKZ2 should be expected to have
higher fecundity than isofemale wild isolates and inbred
lines of other gonochoristic species as it is derived from
more than one founding individual. As this is not the
case (Additional file 1: Figures S5-S6), this suggests that
inbreeding depression alone may not be driving these
patterns. Furthermore, the ecology of C. inopinata may
render it less susceptible to inbreeding depression
through its obligate dispersal on fig wasps [37]. Despite
this, the embryo-to-adult viability of C. inopinata is
low across multiple temperatures (Fig. 5), which is itself
suggestive of inbreeding depression. As we did not
measure larval survival directly, it is unclear at what
stage animals are undergoing developmental arrest.
Additionally, it is possible that behavior could also be
driving these results—larvae that crawl off plates and
do not mature will artificially deflate viability measure-
ments. However, as dead embryos have been anec-
dotally observed in these cultures, embryonic lethality
is likely driving at least some of these patterns. It also
remains possible that the culture conditions designed for
C. elegans are insufficient for the reliable development of
this species, and native fig, wasp, or microbial factors may
be needed for robust C. inopinata viability. Regardless,
future
studies
that
rear
this
species
in
more
ecologically-relevant culture conditions, use C. inopinata
inbred lines and wild isolates, and implement population
genomic approaches in natural populations will be needed
to disentangle these possibilities.
Pleiotropy and life history syndromes
Here we note relationships among life history traits across
two species of Caenorhabditis. What role does pleiotropy
play in the patterns observed here, and are life history syn-
dromes the result of indirect selection, direct selection on
multiple characters, or both? Because this study does not
directly interrogate the genetic basis of these traits, the
underlying genetic causes of these relationships are undeter-
mined. However, the vast background information associ-
ated with the C. elegans model system can provide context
to generate hypotheses regarding the evolution of life his-
tory strategies. How many genes have pleiotropic effects on
multiple life history traits in C. elegans? As discussed above,
most genes associated with one of four life history Worm-
Base phenotypes [48] that might be associated with large
body size (“slow growth”, “reduced brood size,” “extended
life span,” and “long”) do not intersect with one another
(Fig. 6). That is, most genes with any of these phenotypes
are associated with only one of the four (74%; Fig. 6), and
only a fraction of them reveal evidence of pleiotropic effects
(26%; Fig. 6). Thus these life history traits appear to be
largely genetically decoupled in this group, and pleiotropy
need not underlie the correlated evolution of these traits.
However, as some genes do influence multiple phenotypes
(Fig. 6), pleiotropy may still contribute to the evolution of
life history syndromes in this case. Furthermore, as many C.
elegans studies are largely concerned with only a few
phenotypic traits of interest, these results are likely to
underestimate the extent of pleiotropy among C. elegans
genes. Regardless, future work investigating the genetic
bases of these traits in C. inopinata will be needed to
understand the role of pleiotropy in shaping life his-
tory syndromes.
Temperature-dependent patterns of fitness-related traits
in C. Inopinata
Notably, C. inopinata was more fit at higher than lower
temperatures
(Fig.4a,
Fig.
5).
Temperature-dependent
plasticity of fitness-related traits varies both within and
between species in Caenorhabditis, and these patterns often
coincide with ecological context. Within C. briggsae, there
are definable clades that are genetically structured by lati-
tude [78, 79], and these wild isolates reveal temperature-
dependent patterns of fecundity that are consistent with
their geographical origin [80]. Additionally, the tropical
species C. nigoni [66, 81] and C. tropicalis [82] have higher
fitness at warmer temperatures. As C. inopinata has only
been found in the subtropical islands of Okinawa [34, 35],
its temperature-dependent patterns of fitness are consistent
with these previous observations. And further, the tempera-
tures where C. inopinata has shown the highest fitness here
are comparable to natural Ficus septica fig temperatures
measured in nature [37]. Additionally, C. inopinata needs
to be grown at 30°C to approach a rate of development
comparable to that of C. elegans when grown at 20°C.
Could the slow growth of C. inopinata more appropriately
be interpreted as an adjustment of optimal developmental
timing imposed by its subtropical environment? This
explanation is appealing as thermal plasticity in growth is
widespread in ectotherms, and wild F. septica fig interiors
were found to harbor temperatures of 29°C on average
[37]. However, if temperature were a major driver of a
universal, optimal developmental rate in Caenorhabditis,
then we would expect to see much slower development in
tropical strains and species than has been reported
(Additional file 1: Figure S8). Indeed, there are no de-
tectable developmental timing differences between tropical
and temperate strains of C. briggsae (Additional file 1:
Figure S8) [38], which nonetheless do reveal clade-specific,
temperature-dependent differences in fecundity [80]. And
although C. tropicalis, which is typically found in warmer
climates than C. inopinata [51, 83], harbors a slower devel-
opmental rate than C. elegans (Additional file 1: Figure
S7-S8) [38], it remains far faster than that of C. inopinata
Woodruff et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology           (2019) 19:74 
Page 10 of 14
(Additional file 1: Figure S7-S8). Thus, it seems more likely
that the slow growth of C. inopinata is connected to its
novel ecological context in F. septica figs, its exceptionally
large body size, or both, rather than its subtropical locality
alone. Regardless, as a close relative of C. elegans, this
species is well positioned for uncovering the genomic bases
of temperature adaptation.
Conclusions
Body size and ecological divergence are major drivers of
evolutionary change in multiple taxa, and such changes often
co-occur with widespread change in life history traits. Here,
we examined the life history traits of a large, ecologically-
divergent close relative of C. elegans. We found that
C. inopinata develops at nearly half the rate as C. elegans, re-
vealing a likely trade-off between growth and body size. Con-
versely, longevity does not evolve as part of correlated
response to selection on body size in this system, consistent
with previous studies and indicative of genetic decoupling of
longevity from other life-history traits. Future studies that
situate these systems within their natural ecological contexts
will be needed to fully disentangle matters of cause and effect
among the traits that constitute life history strategies. Taken
together, these observations reveal that drastic change in eco-
logical context and body size do not necessarily have an all-
encompassing impact on life history syndromes.
Methods
Strains and maintenance
Animals were maintained on Nematode Growth Media
(with 3.2% agar to discourage burrowing) supplemented
with Escherichia coli strain OP50-1 for food. The
C. inopinata wild isolate strain NKZ2 [35] was utilized
for all observations in this report. C. elegans N2 and the
obligate outcrossing C. elegans fog-2(q71) JK574 [41]
mutant strain were also used for most comparisons.
Notably, C. elegans is hermaphroditic, while C. inopinata
is male/female or gonochoristic. This makes interspecific
comparisons problematic. Thus the fog-2(q71) mutation,
which prevents spermatogenesis only in hermaphrodites
but promotes no obvious somatic defects in either sex
[41], was used to control for differences in reproductive
mode in various comparisons of life history traits.
Developmental timing
The timing of four developmental milestones (hatching,
fourth larval stage (L4), adult stage/young adulthood,
and the onset of reproduction/reproductive adulthood)
was measured at four temperatures: 15°C, 20°C, 25°C,
and 30°C. For synchronization, mid-stage embryos (blas-
tula to 1.5 fold stage) were picked from plates cultured
at 25°C to new plates and then shifted to the given rear-
ing temperature. Plates were then monitored hourly (for
hatching) and then daily (for L4, young adulthood, and
reproductive adulthood) for the onset of developmental
milestones. Male tail and female/hermaphrodite vulva
morphologies were used to define L4 and young adult
stages. The onset of reproduction was scored only
among females and hermaphrodites by the presence of
embryos in the uterus. Plates were assayed until the
number of individuals at or older than a given milestone
did not increase for two hours or days. Animals who
failed to reach a given milestone were not used for sub-
sequent analysis. For analysis, animals were plotted by
their developmental status (“0” = yet to reach milestone;
“1” = reached milestone) over time and logistic regres-
sion was used to estimate the median time to a given
event via the “glm” function (using a binomial distribu-
tion) in the R statistical language. This models approach
was used for hypothesis testing and for calculating 95%
confidence intervals (see Additional file 4; data are avail-
able in Additional files 5 and 6).
Lifespan
Synchronized animals were generated by allowing gravid
females/hermaphrodites (20 C. elegans hermaphrodites or
C. elegans fog-2(q71) pseudo-females per plate; about 100
C. inopinata females per plate) to lay for 2-3 hours. After
a few days, synchronized L4 virgin females/hermaphro-
dites were moved to new plates, with about 30 nematodes
per plate. All animals were transferred every day for the
first 4-5 days of adulthood as hermaphrodites reproduced.
Subsequently, animals were scored every 1-3 days as either
living or dead up until the point that all animals had died.
All measurements were performed at 25°C. The number
of days alive after egg-laying was taken as the measure of
total lifespan. Lifespan and longevity studies in C. elegans
are often concerned with the basis of aging, which is gen-
erally thought to largely occur in adulthood after develop-
mental growth [84]. Thus we report here both total
lifespan (starting at embryogenesis) and adult lifespan
(starting at the onset of maturation). As C. inopinata
and C. elegans display different rates of developmental
growth, this also allows a comparison of the rate of
aging in adults that accounts for this difference. Adult
lifespan was taken as the total lifespan minus two (C.
elegans) or four (C. inopinata) days, as C. inopinata
develops at about half the rate as C. elegans. Statis-
tical analyses were performed as in [38], with the sur-
vival package for the R statistical language being used
to generate survivorship curves and the coxme package be-
ing used to generate Cox proportional hazard models and
perform hypothesis tests (see Additional file 4; data are
available in Additional file 7).

males. For all observations, L4 C. inopinata NKZ2 and
C. elegans fog-2(q71) animals raised at 25°C were isolated
and raised for one (C. elegans) or two (C. inopinata)
days to adulthood (see above). For overnight mating, sin-
gle adult females/pseudo-females were shifted to the
given experimental rearing temperature and mated with
six males overnight. Brood sizes were measured at 15°C,
20°C, 25°C, and 30°C. The next day males were re-
moved. Every day, embryos and larvae were counted,
and egg-laying females were moved to new plates.
New progeny were scored until females stopped lay-
ing for at least one (C. elegans) or two (C. inopi-
nata)
consecutive
days.
Continuous

conditions were similar, except that single females
were always in the presence of six males. Males that
crawled up the side of the plate or otherwise died
before

laying
embryos
were
replaced with young adult males. The continuous
mating observations were performed at 25°C. The
instantaneous rate of natural increase [1] was calcu-
lated in Python as in [85] using life tables for C.
elegans and C. inopinata constructed from the via-
bility, fecundity, and lifespan data developed here
(see Additional file 8; data are available in Additional
files 9, 10, 11 and 12).
Embryo-to-adult viability
Nematode
embryos
were
synchronized
by
allowing
gravid females/hermaphrodites (20 C. elegans hermaph-
rodites or C. elegans fog-2(q71) pseudo-females per plate;
about 100 C. inopinata females per plate) to lay for 2-3
hours. After the parents were removed, the number of
embryos per plate were counted, and the plates were
shifted to their respective rearing temperatures (15°C,
20°C, 25°C, or 30°C). L4 and adult worms were counted
4-5 days later. This fraction of mature worms/initial
worm embryos was reported as the viability. Data are
available in Additional file 13.
Intersection of WormBase phenotypes related to life
history traits among C. elegans protein-coding genes
Functional annotations for all C. elegans protein-cod-
ing genes were retrieved using the simplemine tool in
WormBase (http://www.wormbase.org/tools/mine/sim-
plemine.cgi, link labeled “query all C. elegans”; Add-
itional

Genes
with

phenotypes “long,” “slow growth,” “extended life span,”
and “reduced brood size” were extracted, and a spread-
sheet denoting the intersection of these four pheno-
types for every gene that included at least one of these
phenotypes was created with Linux (see Additional file
15 for software) and Perl (https://github.com/religa/
stats/blob/master/merge) tools (see Additional files 14
and 15 for data). The UpSetR package [86] was used to
make Fig. 6 with this data (Additional file 4).
