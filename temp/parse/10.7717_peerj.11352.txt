ABSTRACT
Flexible resource investment is a risk sensitive reproductive strategy where
individuals trade resources spent on reproduction for basic metabolic maintenance
and survival. This study examined morphological variation in herbivorous sea urchin
grazers across a mosaic landscape of macroalgae dominated habitats interspersed
with patches of sea urchin barrens to determine whether sea urchins shift energy
allocation in response to food limitation. Extensive underwater surveys of habitat
attributes (e.g., sea urchin density, algae cover) were paired with detailed laboratory
assays (e.g., sea urchin dissections) to determine how resource abundance affects
energy allocation between reproductive capacity and body structure in the purple sea
urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. We found that: (1) sea urchins had a
more elongate jaw structure relative to body size in habitats void of macroalgae
(i.e., barrens), (2) sea urchin reproductive capacity (i.e., gonad index) was lower in
barrens and the barrens habitat was primarily comprised of encrusting algae, and
(3) sea urchin jaw morphology (i.e., lantern index) and reproductive capacity
(i.e., gonad index) were inversely related. These results suggest that sea urchins
respond to macroalgae limited environments by shifting energy allocation between
reproductive capacity and modiﬁcations of the foraging apparatus, which may
explain the ability of sea urchins to acquire food in resource-limited environments.

INTRODUCTION
A central issue in life history theory is whether (and how) organisms can be ﬂexible in how
they invest resources (Bradshaw, 1965; Bårdsen et al., 2011). When faced with food
limitations, many organisms will reallocate internal resources, shifting from reproduction
and energy storage to basic metabolic maintenance (Braby & Jones, 1995; Fiore & Rodman,
2001; Bauerfeind & Fischer, 2005). This is especially true in dynamic environments
where organisms are susceptible to rapid (or even seasonal) changes in resources, or
experience periods of extreme climatic events (Boggs & Ross, 1993; Lau et al., 2009).
Therefore, understanding the spatial and temporal scales over which shifting responses
occur can provide insight into when, where, and under what conditions organisms exhibit

the plasticity to allocate resources to favor survival, or maintain their reproductive
capacity.
Sea urchins (Echinoidea) are important benthic herbivores in many marine systems
because of their ability to fundamentally transform macroalgal-dominated communities to
‘barrens’ void of macroalgae (Filbee-Dexter & Scheibling, 2014). The ability for sea
urchins to reallocate resources may be one explanation for the persistence of dense
aggregations of sea urchins in barren habitats with little food availability (Simenstad, Estes
& Kenyon, 1978; McShane & Anderson, 1997). Several studies have documented variation
in sea urchin jaw structure and body shape as a result of changes in food availability
(Ebert, 1980; Black, Johnson & Trendall, 1982; Black et al., 1984; Levitan, 1989, 1991). Food
stress can also negatively impact reproductive success. Sea urchin gonads are both
reproductive organs and important energy reserves that serve as a proxy for measuring
overall health (Walker, 1981; Lawrence & Lane, 1982; Rogers-Bennett et al., 1995). Gonadal
condition has been found to decrease over extended periods of food limitation as sea
urchins are forced to expend energy reserves as food supplements (Vadas, 1977; Andrew,
1989; James, 2007; Schroeter et al., 2009). While these studies suggest that sea urchins
possess a high degree of phenotypic plasticity (i.e., overall test size and jaw structure), the
spatio-temporal scale over which population-level morphological responses occur is less
understood and may only be revealed by tracking population responses through signiﬁcant
environmental changes, such as modiﬁcations in the abundance of macroalgae.
Along the central coast of California, active grazing by purple sea urchins
(Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) shifted expansive kelp forests into a patchy mosaic of
remnant kelp forests interspersed with sea urchin barrens (Smith et al., 2021). Beginning in
the year 2014, an outbreak of purple sea urchins initiated kelp deforestation, which
provided a unique and timely opportunity to explore sea urchin phenotypic plasticity in
a recently transitioned system. Kelp forests and sea urchin barrens represent two
important grazing environments. In patches of kelp forests, sea urchins are often at low
densities and primarily employ a risk-averse passive-grazing strategy on detrital (hereafter,
‘drift’) kelp (Filbee-Dexter & Scheibling, 2014). However, in sea urchin barrens where
drift is limited, sea urchins alter their behavior, emerge from the refuge space of crevices,
and actively graze at high densities on nutrient-poor encrusting algae species (Harrold &
Pearse, 1987; Steneck et al., 2002; DeVries, Webb & Taylor, 2019). Therefore, the success
and survival of sea urchins in these two distinct habitats may be strongly dependent on
the ability of sea urchins to modify resource allocation from reproduction (i.e., gonad
development) to survival (i.e., metabolic maintenance).
Using the mosaic landscape of kelp forests and sea urchin barrens that initiated just
3 years prior to this study, we examined morphological variation in three fundamental sea
urchin traits: jaw shape, body shape, and gonad condition. Speciﬁcally, we tested the
following hypotheses: (1) sea urchin jaw (hereafter, Aristotle’s ‘lantern’) morphology varies
as a function of habitat type (i.e., kelp forest, sea urchin barren), (2) differences in observed
lantern morphology between habitat types is a function of the algal assemblage in each
of those habitats, and (3) sea urchin reproductive capacity (i.e., gonadal condition) is

inversely related to lantern morphology, indicating resource trade-offs between
reproduction and metabolic maintenance.
METHODS
We combine spatially explicit observations of habitat attributes (algae cover, sea urchin
density) between kelp forests and sea urchin barrens with detailed measurements of
morphological traits (jaw shape, body shape, gonad condition) of sea urchins collected
from the ﬁeld to determine the consequences of resource variation on sea urchin
morphology.
Survey design
This study was conducted along the southern end of Monterey Bay, California, USA.
In 2014, overgrazing by purple sea urchins shifted a once expansive kelp forest landscape
to a patchy mosaic of remnant forests interspersed with sea urchin barrens (Smith et al.,
2021). While this study was conducted just 3 years after the initiation of the urchin
outbreak, the spatial extent of barren patches continued to expand both during and for
several years following this study.
Underwater surveys were conducted from June to September in 2017. A total of 83
randomly assigned subtidal survey sites within the study region were sampled to evaluate
sea urchin size structure and density, habitat type (i.e., barrens, kelp forests), and algae
cover (Fig. 1). Survey sites were located between the Breakwater (36.61237578 N,
121.8947703 W) and Point Pinos (36.63878914 N, 121.9246315 W) in Monterey, CA,
in 5 to 20 m of water on rocky reef substratum. Each site was categorically assigned in situ
as one of two habitat types: kelp forest (characterized by high macroalgae presence and low
sea urchin density), or sea urchin barren (characterized by low macroalgae presence,
dominated by coralline algae, and with high sea urchin density). These two categories
formed the basis for all categorical comparisons and analyses.
Each site was surveyed using a radial sampling design following the methods described
in Smith et al. (2021). Brieﬂy, a total of eight 5-m long transects were surveyed at each
site, radiating from a ﬁxed central position. A single transect was assigned to each cardinal
(N, S, E, W) and inter-cardinal (NE, NW, SE, SW) direction around the survey site.
Two randomly placed 1m x 1m photographic quadrats were sampled per transect (16 total
quadrats per site). The location of the quadrats along the transects were assigned using a
randomly stratiﬁed design so that the quadrats were not intentionally biased towards
either the center or outer edge of the site. Within each quadrat, the total number of sea
urchins were quantiﬁed by searching in crevices and carefully examining dense algae.
By utilizing the same sampling design at each site, each of our 83 survey sites represent a
replicate sample.
Variation in sea urchin morphology between habitats
To test the hypothesis that lantern morphology and body shape varies as a function of
habitat type, we conducted a series of laboratory dissections with sea urchins collected
from spatially referenced ﬁeld survey sites (study animal collection approved by the
Smith and Garcia (2021), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.11352

California Department of Fish and Wildlife, permit no. SC-389). Two sea urchins were
randomly collected from ﬁxed opposite corners of each quadrat for a maximum of
32 sea urchins per site. Only urchins greater than 3 cm were collected for dissections. These
size classes of urchins are too large to have settled from the plankton later than 2014.
Therefore, most of the dissected urchins were likely present during the 2014 habitat
transformation event.
A total of 1,058 purple sea urchins were collected for this study. Upon collection, sea
urchins were immediately ‘ﬁxed’ following the methods of Harrold & Reed (1985) to
preserve gonads for dissection. Sea urchins were injected with 3–15 mL of 10% neutral-
buffered formalin (depending on animal size) through the peristomal membrane. After
a 24-h ﬁxation period, sea urchin tests were measured to the nearest 0.5 mm using
Vernier calipers. Test diameter was recorded as the maximum distance across the test,
excluding spines, and test height was measured as the length between the oral and aboral
surfaces (to the nearest 0.05 mm). After these measurements were obtained, sea urchins
were dissected for gonads and to measure lantern morphology. Our measure of lantern

length was recorded as the distance from the oral tip to the aboral surface of the epiphysis.
Lantern width was measured as the maximum diameter of the aboral epiphysis surface.
We evaluated both sea urchin lantern length and gonad weight as independent
functions of test diameter between habitat types (barrens, forest) using separate analysis
of covariance (ANCOVA) tests. In both models, we tested the homogeneity of slopes
assumption by evaluating the effect of test diameter, habitat type (barren, forest), and their
interaction. We found that the interaction was not signiﬁcant, therefore we ran reduced
two-term ANCOVAs with test diameter and habitat type as independent model terms.
Sea urchin gonad weight serves as a useful metric for assessing animal health and
reproductive capacity (Walker, 1981; Lawrence & Lane, 1982). To account for the
relationship between urchin size and gonad weight, we used a gonad index to
comparatively evaluate sea urchin gonad condition and lantern morphology. Sea urchin
gonads were removed from each individual, blotted dry, and wet-weighed to the nearest
0.001 g. Gonad index was calculated as the percent body mass comprised of gonads:
Gonad Index GI
ð
Þ ¼ Gonad Wet Weight g
ð Þ
Total Wet Weight g
ð Þ
ð
Þ  100
(1)
Therefore, higher GI values indicate greater gonad mass relative to the animal’s total
body mass.
Relationship between sea urchin morphology and algae cover
Photographic quadrats were used to estimate algae cover in order to test for a relationship
between algae cover, sea urchin morphology, and condition. Within each quadrat, still
imagery was collected using a downward facing GoPro Hero4 camera and two LED
Sola video lights. Still photos of each quadrat were analyzed in ImageJ using 16 uniform-
points per quadrat. Photos were analyzed in the lab where an observer recorded the
organism below each point to the lowest taxonomic level possible. However, because many
species of algae are difﬁcult to taxonomically identify from photo imagery, algae were
organized into the following morphological groups: brown algae (predominately
Macrocystis pyrifera), foliose red algae (predominately Chondracanthus spp.), and
encrusting algae (includes encrusting red and encrusting coralline algae). These
morphological groups were selected based on their known status as indicators for kelp
forests (brown algae, foliose red) or sea urchin barren (encrusting algae) habitats (Filbee-
Dexter & Scheibling, 2014). First, we used a series of linear regressions to test for
associations between the cover of algae and two metrics of sea urchin morphology
(lantern index, gonad index). Because lantern length was directly proportional to test
diameter in both habitats, we used a lantern index to account for length-size relationships
(e.g., larger animals have larger lanterns), deﬁned as:
Lantern Index LI
ð
Þ ¼ Lantern Length mm
ð
Þ
Test Diameter mm
ð
Þ
(2)
Therefore, higher LI values indicate a longer jaw length relative to body size. We then
used a beta regression on the pooled quadrat data for each site to account for the

5/13
proportional (0–1) response variable (Ferrari & Cribari-Neto, 2004), with mean sea urchin
density as a continuous predictor. We examined sea urchin body size as the ratio of test
diameter to test height between habitat types and found no signiﬁcant difference.
Additionally, lantern width was relatively proportional to body size.
RESULTS
Variation in sea urchin morphometrics as a function of habitat
Sea urchin density was greater in barrens (M = 13.79 ± 1.42 S.E. individuals/m2) than in
the kelp forest habitat (M = 5.33 ± 0.69 S.E. individuals/m2, P < 0.0001). Although
there were differences in sea urchin density between habitat types, the mean test
diameter for sea urchins from barrens (M = 36.58 ± 0.51S.E. mm) and kelp forests
(M = 37.07 ± 0.62 S.E. mm) was not signiﬁcantly different. Similarly, the relationships
between lantern length and lantern width, and between test diameter and test height, did
not vary with habitat type (Fig. 2).
An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) revealed that relative lantern length was
signiﬁcantly greater in sea urchin barrens than in kelp forest habitats (F = 72.63, DF = 2
and 80, P < 0.0001). This difference in lantern length was most pronounced in individuals
less than 49 mm (Fig. 3A). Although lantern length appeared to broadly converge
between habitat types in individuals greater than 50 mm, the interaction between habitat
type and test diameter was not signiﬁcant. Conversely, gonad weight was signiﬁcantly
higher in the kelp forest habitat than in sea urchin barrens (F = 76.54, DF = 2 and 80,
P < 0.0001; Fig. 3B).

The percent cover of algae was correlated with both lantern index and gonad index
(Fig. 4). There was a positive and linear relationship between encrusting algae and lantern
index (R2 = 0.33, P < 0.001; Fig. 4A), while brown (R2 = 0.14, P < 0.001; Fig. 4C) and foliose
red (R2 = 0.14, P < 0.001; Fig. 4E) algae were negatively correlated with lantern index.
In general, these lantern index relationships were inversely correlated with gonad
index. Cover of encrusting algae was negatively correlated with gonad index (R2 = 0.4,
P < 0.001; Fig. 4B), while brown (R2 = 0.075, P < 0.02; Fig. 4D) and foliose red (R2 = 0.35,
P < 0.001; Fig. 4F) algae were positively correlated.
Habitat attributes of kelp forest and sea urchin barrens
We explored differences in the cover of key habitat-indicating algae groups (brown algae,
foliose red, and encrusting algae) and sea urchin density between habitat types to
determine factors that may inﬂuence variation in sea urchin morphological traits.
A reduced two-term model with brown algae and red foliose algae explained the most

variation in habitat type (AIC = 61.48, DF = 3, P < 0.0001). Based on the model
coefﬁcients, high cover of brown and foliose algae explained a greater likelihood of a forest
habitat, while the cover of encrusting algae was negatively correlated with the forest
habitat. Because of the linear relationship between lantern index and sea urchin density,
identical relationships were found between percent cover of algae and sea urchin
density. Finally, there was a positive relationship between encrusting algae and sea urchin
density (F = 36.54, P < 0.0001), while both the cover of brown (F = 12.47, P = 0.0007) and
foliose red (F = 14.02, P < 0.0003) were negatively correlated with sea urchin density
(Fig. 5).

shape, gonad condition) across a patchy mosaic landscape of kelp forests interspersed with

resource-limited sea urchin barrens. The inverse relationship between reproductive
capacity (i.e., gonad index) and jaw morphology (i.e., lantern length) suggests that when
food is scarce, lanterns are lengthened and gonad production declines. The cover of brown
and foliose red algae was correlated with habitat type, which reinforces that key algal
groups facilitate morphometric variation in sea urchins. Our ﬁndings reveal that sea
urchins can alter the Aristotle’s lantern to persist in dense aggregations and in low resource
environments.
The sea urchin barrens that initiated 3-years prior to our study created a unique
opportunity to explore variation in sea urchin morphology between barrens and
macroalgae dominated habitats. This recently transitioned system comprised of a mosaic
of kelp forests and sea urchin barrens helped to reveal that sea urchins may develop an
enlarged feeding apparatus relative to body shape and size over a relatively short duration.
This suggests that lantern morphology is likely inﬂuenced by the composition and
abundance of macroalgae. Foliose red and brown algae are common within patches of
kelp forest, while barrens are primarily dominated by encrusting coralline and encrusting
red algae (Simenstad, Estes & Kenyon, 1978; Filbee-Dexter & Scheibling, 2014).
One possible explanation for lengthened sea urchin lanterns in barrens is increased
foraging ability, where a longer and more supported feeding apparatus enhances scraping
efﬁciency for encrusting algae species that dominate sea urchin barrens. In our laboratory
dissections, sea urchins with longer lanterns appeared to consume larger amounts of
encrusting algae scraped from rocks than those with smaller lanterns. An increased ability
to scrape food off rocks supports the positive relationship found in our study between
encrusting algae and lantern index.
In addition to food limitation driving sea urchin lantern structure, sea urchins have
also been shown to elicit similar morphological changes in response to differences in sea

urchin density (Levitan, 1989). Our study found a linear relationship between lantern
index and sea urchin density, which is similar to that reported by Black, Johnson &
Trendall (1982) in Rottnest Island, Western Australia with Echinometra mathaei having
longer lanterns in areas of higher densities. Other ﬁeld experiments have produced
evidence for density dependent test growth and shrinkage (Ebert, 1967; Pearse & Pearse,
1975). Collectively, these studies highlight the dynamic nature of external factors that
impact sea urchin morphology.
Gonad index is a metric often used to assess reproductive capacity, general health, and
energy storage in sea urchins (Walker, 1981; Lawrence & Lane, 1982; Ebert, Hernández &
Russell, 2012; James & Siikavuopio, 2012). In this study, gonad index was found to be
greatest in forests and lowest in barrens, consistent with existing evidence that gonadal
condition can be affected by the quantity and quality of available food (Lau et al., 2009).
Sea urchins may also allocate energy based on their reproductive stage. For example,
Guillou, Lumingas & Michel (2000) found that adult Sphaerechinus granularis fed in the
pre-spawning stage only carried out gonadal growth and did not expend any resources to
body growth, suggesting a seasonal energy trade off. This conversion has been found
to happen within as short of a span as 3 weeks, suggesting that this rapid shift from gonadal
development and nutrient storage to body maintenance is beneﬁcial in a habitat rapidly
transformed from food abundant to food limited (Russell, 1998).
This study explored variation in sea urchin morphometrics in response to the onset of
widespread sea urchin barrens in Monterey Bay, California, USA. Our study reveals
that sea urchins alter the structure of their foraging apparatus, Aristotle’s lantern, and
energy storage organs (gonads) without fundamental changes in body shape, and these
changes may occur over a relatively short duration. This plastic morphological response to
variation in food availability provides support that lengthened sea urchin lanterns may
enhance grazing efﬁciency and success in food limited environments. Ultimately, these
results highlight the ability for important kelp forest grazers such as sea urchins to persist
in habitats that are void of macroalgae for extended periods of resource limitation.
