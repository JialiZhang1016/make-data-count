Abstract 
Background:  Previous phylogenetic studies that include the four recognized species of Gallus have resulted in a 
number of distinct topologies, with little agreement. Several factors could lead to the failure to converge on a consist-
ent topology, including introgression, incomplete lineage sorting, different data types, or insufficient data.
Methods:  We generated three novel whole genome assemblies for Gallus species, which we combined with data 
from the published genomes of Gallus gallus and Bambusicola thoracicus (a member of the sister genus to Gallus). To 
determine why previous studies have failed to converge on a single topology, we extracted large numbers of ortholo-
gous exons, introns, ultra-conserved elements, and conserved non-exonic elements from the genome assemblies. 
This provided more than 32 million base pairs of data that we used for concatenated maximum likelihood and multi-
species coalescent analyses of Gallus.
Results:  All of our analyses, regardless of data type, yielded a single, well-supported topology. We found some 
evidence for ancient introgression involving specific Gallus lineages as well as modest data type effects that had an 
impact on support and branch length estimates in specific analyses. However, the estimated gene tree spectra for all 
data types had a relatively good fit to their expectation given the multispecies coalescent.
Conclusions:  Overall, our data suggest that conflicts among previous studies probably reflect the use of smaller 
datasets (both in terms of number of sites and of loci) in those analyses. Our results demonstrate the importance of 
sampling large numbers of loci, each of which has a sufficient number of sites to provide robust estimates of gene 
trees. Low-coverage whole genome sequencing, as we did here, represents a cost-effective means to generate the 
very large data sets that include multiple data types that enabled us to obtain a robust estimate of Gallus phylogeny.

Background
The Domestic Chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is 
among the best-studied bird species, with many studies 
examining the genetics, physiology, and development of 
various chicken breeds. Due to its economic and agri-
cultural importance, the wild progenitor of the Domes-
tic Chicken, Gallus gallus (Red Junglefowl), was the first 
avian species whose genome was completely sequenced 
(ICGSC 2004). Since then, genomes of many of the 
hundreds of different breeds of Gallus gallus have been 
sequenced (e.g., Imsland et al. 2012; Yi et al. 2014; Wang 
et al. 2015; Lawal et al. 2018; Li et al. 2019; Yang et al. 
2019), resulting in a large number of available chicken 
genomes.
In addition to G. gallus, the genus Gallus has three 
additional species (Gill and Donsker 2019): Gallus lafay-
ettii (Sri Lanka Junglefowl), G. sonneratii (Grey Jungle-
fowl), and G. varius (Green Junglefowl). These species 
are relatively closely related, with the earliest divergence 
approximately 4‒5 million years ago (Mya; Hosner et al.

2017; Wang et al. 2017). Males of these species all have 
combs and wattles, traits that are involved in sexual 
selection (Ligon et  al. 1998), although there are some 
differences among species in the plumage as well as the 
color and structure of the combs and wattles (Fig. 1). All 
molecular studies (e.g., Kimball et  al. 1999; Armstrong 
et al. 2001; all studies in Fig. 2) have consistently shown 
that Bambusicola, the Bamboo Partridges, is the sister 
genus to Gallus, but in contrast to the high sexual dimor-
phism in the four Gallus species, Bambusicola is mono-
morphic, being relatively drab in color in both sexes 
(Fig. 1). The estimated divergence time between the two 
genera is approximately 15‒16 Mya (Hosner et al. 2017; 
Wang et al. 2017). 
Despite the intensive focus on the genomes of Domes-
tic Chickens, genomes for close relatives on G. gallus 
have not yet been sequenced. Recently, Tiley et al. (2018) 
published a genome description from Bambusicola 
thoracicus, the Chinese Bamboo Partridge, along with 
genomic comparisons to G. gallus. However, genomes 
of the additional species of Gallus have the potential to 
provide a more in-depth understanding of the evolution 
of the genus as a whole. Indeed, the phylogenetic rela-
tionships among the four Gallus species remain unre-
solved. Earlier studies, using mitochondrial and/or small 
numbers of nuclear markers, resulted in six alternative 
topologies (Fig. 2). More recently, studies using over 4800 
ultra-conserved element (UCE) markers found strong 
support for a seventh topology (Hosner et al. 2016, 2017). 
However, analyses of different types of genomic data can 
yield alternative topologies (e.g., Jarvis et al. 2014; Chen 
et al. 2017; Reddy et al. 2017). Therefore, it is not clear 
whether a broader sampling of different data types from 
throughout the genome will result in the same species 
tree estimate as Hosner et al. (2016).
Data type is not the only explanation for the observed 
differences among studies; the different topologies may 
result from introgression. Crosses among all Gallus spe-
cies are known to produce viable offspring (reviewed by 
Johnsgard 1999; McCarthy 2006). There is molecular 
evidence for recent introgression among multiple Gallus 
species (Nishibori et al. 2005), as well as a nuclear gene 
from G. sonneratii (yellow skin) having introgressed into 
Domestic Chickens (Eriksson et al. 2008). Another alter-
native may be the random sampling of gene trees. Gene 
trees may exhibit multiple evolutionary histories, even 
without introgression, due to incomplete lineage sorting 
(Maddison 1997). Thus, any relatively small sample of 
gene trees will represent a somewhat unpredictable set 
of topologies. Finally, insufficient data from individual 
loci can also be problematic, since it would not include 
enough informative sites to accurately resolve relation-
ships (e.g., Saitou and Nei 1986; Chojnowski et al. 2008; 
Kimball and Braun 2014).
Here we present whole genome sequences for the 
three remaining species of Gallus and use those 
sequences to obtain a better understanding of Gal-
lus phylogeny and molecular evolution. We accom-
plished this by combining the new genomic data with 
the published genome assemblies available for G. gal-
lus and B. thoracicus (as an outgroup), allowing us 
to generate a more rigorous estimate of the relation-
ships among Gallus species. The use of whole genomes 
allowed us to evaluate alternative explanations for con-
flicts among previous studies. To examine data type 
effects we estimated independent phylogenies using 
protein coding exons, introns, UCEs, and conserved

non-exonic elements (CNEEs). Finally, we also tested 
whether our gene tree results were consistent with 
expectations given the multispecies coalescent or 
whether some degree of historical introgression was 
necessary to explain our data.
Methods
Genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation
The genomes of Gallus lafayettii, Gallus sonneratii, and 
Gallus varius were sequenced using methods described 
in Tiley et  al. (2018) for Bambusicola thoracicus. The 
individuals were all captives, sampled from breeders in 
the United States. Two of the samples were from males 
(G. lafayettii and G. varius), while the other was from a 
female (G. sonneratii). Briefly, DNA was isolated using 
the Gentra PureGene DNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen) fol-
lowing manufacturer’s instructions. DNA was then sent 
to the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for 
Biotechnology Research for library preparation, frag-
ment selection, and sequencing. For each of the three 
genomes, a single insert library was prepared using Illu-
mina’s NEBNext Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit following 
Fig. 2  Published molecular studies that included all four species of Gallus. Analyses based just on nuclear data are in bold, and those just on 
mitochondrial data are in italics. Specific figures for each study are noted (as some studies included multiple analyses with different topologies)

the manufacturer’s instructions. A single insert of 
approximately 500 base pairs (bp) was selected for the 
NextSeq  500 sample preparation protocol. All three 
libraries, as well as libraries for Bambusicola thoracicus, 
were combined and sequenced across four lanes on a sin-
gle flow cell using paired-end 150 bp reads on an Illumina 
NextSeq 500.
The three Gallus genomes were assembled using MaS-
uRCA v2.3.2 (Zimin et  al. 2013), which automatically 
trims Illumina reads with QuorUM (Marcais et al. 2015) 
and determines the optimal kmer size with Jellyfish 
(Marcais and Kingsford 2011). Genomes were masked 
and repeat content estimated with RepeatMasker v4.0.5 
based on the “Aves” repeat library (Smit et al. 2015). We 
annotated protein-coding gene models from our de novo 
assemblies using MAKER v2.31.8 (Cantarel et  al. 2008). 
We used AUGUSTUS v3.2.1 (Stanke et  al. 2006) for ab 
intio gene prediction based on a library of Gallus gallus 
RefSeq sequences. For gene prediction, we also used pro-
tein homology evidence. To do this we downloaded pro-
tein sequences for Gallus gallus (ftp.ensem​bl.org/pub/
relea​se-84/fasta​/gallu​s_gallu​s/pep/; accessed 21 Decem-
ber 2015), Melagris gallopavo (ftp.ensem​bl.org/pub/
relea​se-83/fasta​/melea​gris_gallo​pavo/pep/; accessed 21 
December 2015), and Taeniopygia guttata (ftp.ensem​
bl.org/pub/relea​se-83/fasta​/taeni​opygi​a_gutta​ta/pep/; 
accessed 21 December 2015) from Ensembl (Cunningham 
et al. 2015).
For our evolutionary analyses, in addition to the three 
genomes, we used data from the Bambuscola thoraci-
cus assembly and annotations (Tiley et  al. 2018) and 
the Gallus gallus version 4 reference genome assem-
bly. For the G. gallus genome, we downloaded annota-
tions (ftp.ensem​bl.org/pub/relea​se-82/fasta​/gallu​s_gallu​
s/; accessed October 2015) and gene features (ftp.ensem​
bl.org/pub/relea​se-82/gff3/gallu​s_gallu​s/; accessed Octo-
ber 2015) from Ensembl (Cunningham et al. 2015).
Datasets for phylogenetic estimation
To get a genomic perspective on the phylogenetic rela-
tionships of Gallus species, we assembled various data-
sets from sets of orthologous genes (including exons 
and introns), UCEs (Faircloth et  al. 2012), and CNEEs 
(Edwards et al. 2017). First, we used the translated amino 
acid sequences from annotated gene models to circum-
scribe orthologous groups using orthoMCL (Li et  al. 
2003). For phylogenetic analyses we used only the orthol-
ogous groups that had exactly one sequence represented 
for each of the five species in our analysis. We then 
extracted individual exon and intron sequences from the 
genome assemblies using the gene feature format files 
generated by MAKER, or publicly available in the case 
of G. gallus. To ensure we aligned orthologous regions 
in all cases, we created BLAST databases for exon and 
intron sequences and performed an all-by-all BLASTN 
(Altschul et al. 1990; Camacho et al. 2008) search, saving 
only one alignment per hit with an E-value ≤ ­10‒5. Then 
we used single linkage clustering to recover one-to-one 
groups of homologous exons or introns. This strategy 
avoided potential complications due to absences that 
reflect partial gene models or even exon or intron gains 
and losses. We aligned each set of orthologous exons or 
introns with MUSCLE (Edgar 2004). Because individual 
exons are not guaranteed to begin on a first position of 
a codon, sequences were not aligned by codon. Only 
alignments with all five species present that were at least 
100 bp in length were retained for phylogenetic analyses. 
We did not exclude reads from mitochondrial genome. 
Although this may introduce some mitochondrial data 
into the orthogroups we analyzed in this study, they will 
be a very small number compared to the total set.
We used methods described in Reddy et  al. (2017) to 
extract UCE and CNEE sequences. Briefly, we built pro-
file hidden Markov models (HMM) queries from the UCE 
and CNEE alignments generated by Jarvis et al. (2014) and 
Edwards et al. (2017), respectively, and then we used nhm-
mer (Wheeler and Eddy 2013) to search each genome. 
We downloaded the Jarvis et al. (2014) UCE alignments 
from http://gigad​b.org/datas​et/10104​1 and the Edwards 
et  al. (2017) CNEE alignments from https​://datad​ryad.
org/resou​rce/doi:10.5061/dryad​.25f7g​. The homologous 
regions in each genome were extracted and aligned using 
MAFFT v7.130b (Katoh and Standley 2013). The pipeline 
used for this analysis is available from GitHub (see “Ext-
tract_seq” in the data availability section below). Some 
CNEEs overlap with UCEs, so we eliminated any CNEE 
alignments where the Gallus gallus CNEE had a BLASTN 
(Camacho et al. 2008) hit with an E-value ≤ 10‒4 to a UCE 
sequence. The procedure resulted in a total of 3660 UCE 
alignments and 2160 CNEE alignments.
Phylogenetic inference
For each of the data types (exons, introns, UCEs, and 
CNEEs), we first concatenated all loci and estimated 
maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees for each 
of the four supermatrices with RAxML v8.2.10 (Stama-
takis 2014) using the GTR​CAT​ model. For each dataset, 
we ran 100 non-parametric bootstrap replicates using the 
same methods (Felsenstein 1985). We also concatenated 
the supermatrices from all of the datatypes into a single 
comprehensive supermatrix and performed ML and ML 
bootstrapping analyses on it as described above.
To conduct species tree inference based on a coalescent 
model, we used ASTRAL-III v.5.6.3 (Zhang et al. 2018). 
This requires gene trees from individual partitions (e.g., 
a single exon, intron, UCE, or CNEE). Since including 
Page 5 of 15
Tiley et al. Avian Res            (2020) 11:7 
	
poorly supported trees can mislead summary tree coa-
lescence methods (Patel et al. 2013; Mirarab et al. 2014; 
Xi et  al. 2015; Meiklejohn et  al. 2016), we only consid-
ered individual intron, exon, UCE or CNEE alignments 
with at least 10 parsimony informative sites. Addition-
ally, some genes had multiple introns and exons which 
may produce non-independent gene trees; in these cases, 
we selected the intron or exon with the most parsimony 
informative sites as a single representative. There were 
no CNEE cluster alignments with 10 or more parsimony 
informative sites, so we did not use CNEEs for coalescent 
species tree analysis with gene tree topologies. We esti-
mated gene trees for these individual loci using RAxML 
v8.2.10 (Stamatakis 2014) with the GTR​CAT​ model. We 
ran an ASTRAL analysis for sets of the intron trees, exon 
trees, and UCE trees. Quartet support for ASTRAL spe-
cies trees was evaluated using local posterior probabili-
ties (Sayyari and Mirarab 2016). We also ran a combined 
ASTRAL analysis on a set of trees that included all UCE 
trees, and for each gene, either the intron or exon that had 
the most parsimony informative sites.
The length of genomic regions that share the same 
evolutionary history (c-genes, as defined by Doyle 1997) 
is unclear. Intralocus recombination may be sufficiently 
common to render c-genes extremely short (Springer 
and Gatesy 2016), but other studies have implicitly 
assumed that entire transcription units are equivalent 
to c-genes (Song et  al. 2012; Jarvis et  al. 2014). C-gene 
lengths are likely to be sensitive to a number of factors, 
including the recombination rate and the species tree 
topology and branch lengths. Therefore, we took a con-
servative approach and sampled the most informative 
exon or intron from each gene to estimate gene trees 
for the ASTRAL analysis. Although there may be some 
intralocus recombination within the genus Gallus, using 
only a single exon or intron per gene should limit the 
number of cases where this is a problem. This conserva-
tive approach comes with a cost because it either excludes 
additional gene trees that could have been included (if 
c-genes are short) or it excludes sites that could increase 
the accuracy of gene tree estimation (if c-genes are long). 
However, it represents a straightforward way to avoid 
strong assumptions regarding the length of c-genes.
To complement the ASTRAL analysis of gene trees, 
we also used ASTRAL to analyze perfect transver-
sions. We defined perfect transversions as parsimony 
informative sites with exactly two states and no gaps in 
the alignment column that differ by a transversion. We 
treated these sites as defining a single bipartition in a 
gene tree, so we generated partially resolved gene trees 
based on each perfect transversion site (rather than on a 
gene region, as above) and used those trees as input for 
ASTRAL. The ASTRAL analysis of perfect transversions 
has two desirable properties: (1) it permits the inclusion 
of all sequences in the analysis (since it focuses on sites, 
not on regions with more than 10 parsimony informa-
tive sites); and (2) it should be a consistent estimator for 
the species tree even if c-genes are very short (i.e., even 
if they are shorter than 100 bp). As described above, we 
used local posterior probabilities to examine support in 
this analysis.
Deviation from base composition stationarity (i.e., 
cases where taxa differ in base composition) has been 
suggested to mislead estimates of phylogeny (e.g. Conant 
and Lewis 2001; Betancur et  al. 2013), and specifically 
estimates from avian exons (Jarvis et  al. 2014). There-
fore, we examined variation in base composition for all 
concatenated datasets using PAUP* 4.0a166 (Swofford 
2019). Briefly, we deleted the Bambusicola outgroup, 
excluded parsimony uninformative sites, and used the 
“statefreq” command to obtain base composition data. 
Then we calculated the composition along three axes: 
(1) the strong–weak axis (the proportion of G and C); (2) 
the purine–pyrimidine axis (the proportion of A and G); 
and (3) the amino–keto axis (the proportion of A and C) 
for each species. We calculated the range (max‒min) for 
each pair of nucleotides (GC, AG, or AC) among the four 
species to determine whether species exhibited much dif-
ference in base composition.
Gene tree comparisons
We examined the fit of gene trees to the expectation given 
the multispecies coalescent in two ways. First, we calcu-
lated the expected spectrum of gene trees as described by 
Rosenberg (2002) using coalescent branch length estimates 
from ASTRAL. Code for this calculation is available from 
GitHub (see “asymtree” in the data availability section 
below). Second, we performed all possible single taxon 
deletions and examined the degree of asymmetry in the 
minority topologies (which are expected to be equiproba-
ble if discordance among gene trees only reflects the multi-
species coalescent; Pamilo and Nei 1988). Differences from 
the expectation given the multispecies coalescent were 
examined using the χ2 test. We also tested whether there 
was a difference among the spectra of gene tree topologies 
for trees generated using introns, exons, and UCEs. We did 
this because some previous analyses have shown that dif-
ferent data types can yield distinct topologies (Jarvis et al. 
2014; Chen et al. 2017; Reddy et al. 2017). For the latter 
test we examined whether exons, introns, and UCEs were 
significantly different from expectation given homogene-
ity rather than testing for deviation from the multispecies 
coalescent (i.e., instead of a simple test using 15 counts of 
all rooted four taxon gene trees we used a 15 × 3 count 
matrix of all rooted four taxon trees generated using the 
introns, exons, and UCEs).

The simplest interpretation of asymmetries in the gene 
tree spectrum for quartets (which we observed for two 
pairs of taxa: G. gallus‒G. varius and G. gallus‒G. sonner-
atii; see below in “Results”) is introgression. This intro-
gression could be relatively ancient, or it could reflect very 
recent introgression due to humans moving domesticated 
chickens into sympatry with other Gallus species or to 
hybridization among captive populations of various spe-
cies. The individuals sequenced for this study were cho-
sen because they showed substantial differences among all 
species at 15 nuclear loci and their mitogenomes (Kimball 
and Braun 2014), so they cannot be simple (F1) hybrids 
or backcrosses. However, it remains possible that they are 
relatively recent (e.g., fourth generation) backcrosses or 
that recent anthropogenic gene flow has been relatively 
high. We examined asymmetries in quartets for evidence 
of recent introgression; this would predict that gene trees 
with clades showing up in excess of the expectation from 
incomplete lineage sorting alone would also have an excess 
of very short (essentially zero length) branches for the rel-
evant taxa. That is because alleles from one species that 
have very recently introgressed into the other will lead to 
identical alleles in the two species. Although population 
variation and/or mutation may result in one or two differ-
ences between species for these alleles, they will exhibit 
extremely short branches. To test the very recent intro-
gression hypothesis, we conducted two analyses in which 
intronic gene trees were divided into two groups (based 
on observed asymmetries; see Results): (1) trees with a 
G. gallus‒G. varius clade and those without; and (2) trees 
with a G. gallus‒G. sonneratii clade and those without. We 
focused on intronic gene trees because introns generally 
accumulate substitutions at a higher rate than the other 
marker types. The distribution of terminal branch lengths 
for G. varius and G. sonneratii was then compared for the 
two groups of trees to determine whether there was an 
excess of very short terminal branches in the gene trees 
with the relevant clade.
We also evaluated the presence of historical introgres-
sion by analyzing our ML gene tress with PhyloNetworks 
(Solís-Lemus et al. 2017). PhyloNetworks uses distribu-
tions of quartets to evaluate the pseudolikelihood of a 
phylogenetic network under a coalescent model. Similar 
to our analyses of gene tree spectra, an excess of quartets 
that conflict with the species tree is interpreted as intro-
gression. We ran PhyloNetworks for 20 iterations while 
allowing for zero, one, or two reticulations, and plotted 
profiles of pseudolikelihoods for each number of reticu-
lations to determine the appropriate network topology 
with slope heuristics (Solís-Lemus and Ané 2016).
Results
Assembly and annotation of three novel Gallus genomes
Assembly quality and depth of coverage of the three 
new Gallus genomes (Additional file  2: Table  S1) were 
similar to those we obtained for Bambusicola thoraci-
cus (Tiley et al. 2018). The de novo assemblies recovered 
most of the genome based on comparisons to G. gallus. 
Although our genome assemblies are highly fragmented 
due to a lack of long-range information for scaffolding 
(Additional file 2: Table S1), such genomes can provide 
valuable information for phylogenetic studies (e.g., Jarvis 
et al. 2014) and for analyses of molecular evolution (e.g., 
Tiley et al. 2018). Indeed, our recovery of 7513 one-to-
one orthologous clusters, which yielded 40,621 one-
to-one intron and 40,859 one-to-one exon alignments, 
emphasizes the value of relatively low coverage genomes 
for phylogenomic analyses.
Analysis of repeat content further emphasized the 
completeness of our Gallus genome assemblies. All new 
Gallus genomes contained about 9% transposable ele-
ment content with the majority of repeats annotated as 
chicken repeat 1 elements (CR1s), consistent with other 
bird genomes (Table  1). This estimated repeat content 
is only slightly lower than the repeat content of the ref-
erence G. gallus genome, suggesting little information

Phylogenomic analysis of the genus Gallus
The ML tree generated using the complete alignment of 
over 32 megabase pairs (Mbp) of orthologous sequences 
from the four Gallus species and the Bambusicola out-
group had 100% bootstrap support for both internal 
nodes (Fig.  3). The topology of the Gallus species tree 
obtained using ASTRAL to summarize 3406 gene trees 
was identical to the estimate of Gallus phylogeny gener-
ated by analysis of concatenated data (Fig.  3); the local 
posterior probabilities for both branches in the ASTRAL 
tree were maximal (1.0). Finally, the topology of the 
ASTRAL tree generated using 35,920 “perfect transver-
sions” extracted from the complete alignment was iden-
tical to trees generated by ML concatenation and the 
ASTRAL analysis of 3406 gene trees, and they also had 
local posterior probabilities of 1.0, although the coales-
cent branch lengths estimated using perfect transver-
sions were slightly shorter than those estimated using 
gene trees (Fig. 3).
Of the 15 possible rooted topologies for the four spe-
cies within Gallus, the distribution of gene trees with 
each topology appears to generally fit the expectation 
given the multispecies coalescent (Fig. 4). Although it is 
possible for a rooted four-taxon species tree to be in the 
“anomaly zone” (where the most common gene tree does 
not match the species tree), our estimates of coalescent 
branch lengths indicated that the most common gene 
tree for Gallus should match the species tree (Fig. 4 and 
Additional file 3). Almost 36% of gene trees were topo-
logically identical to the estimated species tree (i.e., spe-
ciodendric; Rosenberg 2002). This is slightly fewer than 
expected given the ASTRAL branch lengths estimated 
using gene trees as input (Fig. 4) and slightly more than 
expected given the ASTRAL branch lengths gener-
ated using perfect transversion data (Additional file  3). 
Although the observed spectrum of gene tree topologies 
appeared to have a fairly good fit to the multispecies coa-
lescent based on a simple visual assessment, a perfect fit 
to expectation was strongly rejected (χ2 = 341.74; df = 14; 
p = 2.2 × 10‒64). Specifically, many topologies expected 
to be relatively common, including the speciodendric 
topology, were slightly less common than expected given 
the multispecies coalescent. Instead, there was a modest 
excess of non-speciodendric gene trees that included a G. 
gallus‒G. varius clade (topologies 1, 14, and 15) as well as 
a slight excess of gene trees with topology 10 (Fig. 4).
The impact of data type on phylogenomic analyses 
of Gallus
Independent concatenated ML analyses of four data 
types (CNEEs, exons, introns, and UCEs) all resulted in 
a topology identical to the combined topology (Fig.  3), 
although support differed among the data types (Table 2). 
Bootstrap support was not a simple function of the num-
ber of sites in each subset of the data; support was actu-
ally lowest for the exon dataset and maximal for the UCE 
dataset. In addition to expected differences in overall 
evolutionary rate (the treelength for CNEEs was only 
1/5 that of the combined dataset), data type also had an 
impact on relative branch lengths. Specifically, the inter-
nal branches make up a much smaller proportion of the 
total treelength for the CNEE tree than they do for the 
other trees (Table 2).
Differences were also evident among gene tree distribu-
tions for exons, introns, and UCEs (Fig. 5). We were able 
to reject the null hypothesis of homogeneity for the three 
data types (χ2 = 60.239; df = 28; p = 0.00038); the primary 
difference among the spectra appeared to be the large 
excess of trees with the G. sonneratii–G. gallus clade 
for the exons (topology 10; Additional file 3). However, 
one limitation of the use of gene trees for this analysis is 
that many regions did not have enough informative sites 
to provide a reliable estimate of the gene tree topology 
(we only considered regions with at least ten parsimony 
Fig. 3  Whole genome phylogeny for Gallus. ML and the ASTRAL 
species trees were topologically identical. ML bootstrap support for 
both nodes was 100%, while both ASTRAL (estimated from gene 
trees or from perfect transversions) had local posterior probabilities of 
1.0. Estimated branch lengths for the internal branches (A and B) are 
presented; the units for branch lengths are substitutions per site for 
ML and coalescent units for ASTRAL

informative sites). Our analyses of perfect transver-
sions allowed us to include CNEEs (in addition to exons, 
introns, and UCEs); doing so revealed additional dif-
ferences among data types. ASTRAL branch lengths 
were generally longer for the analyses of gene trees than 
they were for perfect transversions (Table 3), which we 
expected based on the analyses of all data types (Fig. 3). 
However, analysis of the CNEE data resulted in longer 
coalescent branch length estimates than the other data 
types, and the estimate of the length of the branch unit-
ing G. gallus, G. sonneratii, and G. lafayettii was actually 
longer than all of the branch length estimates based on 
gene trees. Despite the observed differences among data 
types, all ASTRAL analyses resulted in the same species 
tree topology, and both branches had maximal (local pos-
terior probability of 1.0) support (Fig. 3 and Additional 
file 4: Treefile 1).
The observation that analyses of all data partitions 
resulted in the same topology suggests that factors like 
deviation from base composition stationarity have not 
affected our estimates of Gallus phylogeny. However, 
shifts in base composition over time, which have been 
observed in avian phylogenomic studies focused on 
longer time scales (Jarvis et al. 2014; Braun et al. 2019), 
could explain some of the inconsistent results obtained 
in previous studies of Gallus phylogeny (Fig. 2). We did 
observe some variation across the four Gallus species 
in the base composition of parsimony informative sites

for the different data types (Table 4). The greatest varia-
tion was typically along the GC-AT axis, though CNEEs 
had slightly more variation along the AC-GT axis. Exons 
exhibited substantially more variation than the non-
coding data partitions (exhibiting nearly 2‒3 × more 
variation in base composition than the other data types), 
consistent with the observation that exons exhibit more 
variation in GC-content than introns when all birds are 
examined (Reddy et  al. 2017). The mean GC-content 
for informative sites was close to 50% for all data types 
(Table 4). However, the GC-content was higher than this 
average for G. gallus and G. varius and lower for G. son-
neratii and G. lafayettii for most data types. The largest 
degree of variation was in GC-content for three of the 
four data types and the largest effect was for exons. The 
exceptional data type was CNEEs, where variation in the 
proportion of AC (i.e., variation on the amino-keto axis)

was slightly higher than variation in the proportion of 
GC. However, the small number of informative sites in 
CNEEs (Table 2) is expected to result in a high sampling 
variance, so this is unlikely to reflect genuinely higher 
variance on the amino-keto axis. The dominant pattern 
is the relatively high GC-content variant along with the 
more than 2.5-fold greater variation in exons.
Asymmetries in Gallus gene tree spectra suggest ancient 
introgression
Examining the patterns evident in the full spectrum 
of the 15 possible gene trees is challenging, but single 
taxon deletions can simplify the expectations. When 
only four taxa are considered, the multispecies coalescent 
makes two predictions: (1) the majority gene tree topol-
ogy will be congruent with the species tree; and (2) the 
two minority gene tree topologies will be equiprobable 
(Pamilo and Nei 1988). Deviations from this expecta-
tion can be driven by asymmetric patterns of gene flow 
(e.g., introgression) or by systematic biases in gene tree 
estimation that favor one of the two minority topologies. 
We found strong asymmetries in four of the five possible 
taxon deletions (Table 5). More specifically, there was a 
large excess of gene trees that had a G. gallus‒G. varius 
clade (evident when either G. lafayettii or G. sonneratii 
was deleted) and a somewhat more modest excess of 
gene trees with a G. gallus‒G. sonneratii clade (evident 
when G. varius or Bambusicola was deleted). In contrast 
to these asymmetries, deletion of G. gallus resulted in 
nearly equal minority topologies (Table 5).
The same asymmetries were evident in the perfect 
transversion data (Additional file 5: Table S2). The counts 
of transversions that support each topology were of 
course much higher than the number of gene trees, but 
the magnitude of the differences for the minority topol-
ogies was very similar. The perfect transversion data 
further emphasized the near equality of two minority 
topologies when after deletion of G. gallus; the modest 
excess of gene tree topologies with a G. varius‒G. son-
neratii clade relative to a G. varius‒G. lafayettii clade 
(Table  4) is reversed in the perfect transversion data 
(2781 transversions support G. varius + G. sonneratii 
and 2813 support G. varius + G. lafayettii). The sim-
plest interpretation of these data is the existence of gene 
flow after the radiation of the four species that involves 
two specific pairs of species: (1) G. gallus and G. varius, 
and (2) G. gallus and G. sonneratii. If introgression had 
occurred very recently (i.e., since the domestication of 
chickens), we would expect zero (or very few) substitu-
tions since the time of introgression. This would lead to 
virtually identical sequences for G. gallus and the other 
taxon involved in the introgression, which would result 
in an excess of very short terminal branches for these 
pairs of taxa. We looked for the excess of very short ter-
minal branch lengths in the intronic gene trees that could 
reflect introgression, but we did not observe a difference 
in the distribution of terminal branch lengths (Additional 
file 6: Fig. S1), suggesting much of the introgression was 
ancient.
Our analyses with phylogenetic networks also sup-
ported introgression between G. gallus and G. varius. 
We observed an improvement in the pseudolikelihood 
score when allowing for one reticulation (Additional 
file  7: Fig. S2). The best network allowing for one 
reticulation showed that about 15% of gene trees are 
introgressed between G. gallus and G. varius, which is 
consistent with our analyses of gene tree spectra (Addi-
tional file 8: Fig. S3).
Discussion
A strongly supported Gallus species tree combined 
with introgression
Phylogenomic analyses of the genus Gallus using thou-
sands of loci of four different data types produced a 
strongly supported topology (Fig. 3) that was congruent 
with published UCE studies (Hosner et al. 2016, 2017). 
For the individuals included in our study, there was evi-
dence of ancient, but not recent, introgression, suggest-
ing that these genomes are good representatives of their 
respective species. The well-resolved phylogeny and

Sampling variance and errors in phylogenetic estimation
The strong support in this study raises the question of 
why previous studies (prior to the UCE studies; Fig.  2) 
have failed to find consensus, or even to recover the 
topology we found in all of our analyses. There are two 
main reasons why phylogenetic analyses might fail to 
recover the true topology: sampling error and system-
atic error. Our results suggest the failure of most previ-
ous analyses to recover the topology found in this study is 
likely to reflect sampling error.
There are two types of sampling error that may have been 
important; the first reflects why phylogenetic studies can 
benefit from sampling large numbers of loci and the impor-
tance of the multispecies coalescent. Given the branch 
lengths estimated by ASTRAL, we expect 29.1% to 36.5% 
of gene trees (based on the perfect transversion and gene 
tree analysis, respectively) to be speciodendric (i.e., match 
the species tree). The largest number of gene trees sam-
pled prior to the Hosner et al. studies was 15 (Kimball and 
Braun 2014). The expectation is that ~ 4‒5 of those trees 
would match the species tree, with the probability of not 
sampling any speciodendric gene trees being relatively low 
(p = 0.0011 for the higher probability and p = 0.0058 for the 
lower probability, binomial test). However, these probabili-
ties assume the gene trees are fully resolved. Examination 
of unpublished gene trees from Kimball and Braun (2014) 
revealed that six (of 15) trees were unresolved (i.e., they 
exhibited a polytomy within Gallus for the ML tree), and 
three of the unresolved gene trees were compatible with the 
species tree (Additional file 9: Treefile 2). Observing three 
speciodendric gene trees given the Kimball and Braun 
(2014) sample size is not unexpected (0.144 < p < 0.324, 
binomial test), assuming all three of those the unresolved 
trees were actually speciodendric trees.
The lack of resolution observed in the Kimball and 
Braun (2014) gene trees, where 40% (6 of 15) gene trees 
were unresolved, emphasizes the second type of sampling 
variance: sampling insufficient information in each gene 
tree to resolve the gene tree. Sampling more sites within 
loci can provide better resolution (more likely to match 
the true underlying tree), emphasizing that the short seg-
ments that are often used to estimate gene trees can be 
problematic (Patel et al. 2013; Gatesy and Springer 2014; 
Mirarab et al. 2014). For this study, we limited the impact 
of uninformative gene regions by limiting our gene tree 
analyses to loci with at least 10 informative sites, in con-
trast to prior analyses where the number of informative 
sites given the four Gallus species and the Bambusicola 
outgroup was not considered. These results emphasize 
the fact that phylogenomics, particularly when it reflects 
the use of data extracted from whole genomes (where 
longer loci can be obtained), can provide a way to over-
come both types of sampling variance (Gee 2003).
In contrast to sampling error, which one can be over-
come by adding loci and by sampling more informative 
loci, systematic error reflects cases where adding data 
(either loci, sites, or both) actually increases support for 
an incorrect tree. One type of systematic error is “local-
ized biases”, where specific loci within phylogenomic 
datasets exhibit strong (and potentially misleading) 
signals (e.g., Kimball et  al. 2013; Brown and Thomson 
2016; Shen et al. 2017). This is the only type of system-
atic error that could explain the failure of previous Gal-
lus phylogenies to recover the topology found in this 
dataset, assuming previous studies sampled one or more 
misleading loci. However, previous studies varied in the 
loci included, making this explanation unlikely. Taken as 
a whole, our results suggest that the simplest explanation 
for the failure of previous studies to recover the topology 
found in this study is simply the limited number of loci 
and sites sampled in those studies.
Introgression
Given that hybridization can occur among all of the Gal-
lus species, it is certainly possible that introgression has 
affected genomes in this genus. As a first step to under-
stand the possible role of introgression, we looked for 
asymmetries in gene trees. Analyses of gene trees and 
perfect transversions suggested the existence of some 
gene flow after speciation, with the gene flow involving 
two specific pairs of taxa: G. gallus + G. varius and G. gal-
lus + G. sonneratii. The distribution of terminal branch 
lengths in G. varius and G. sonneratii (Additional file 6: 
Fig. S1) indicates that, if the asymmetries reflect intro-
gression, the vast majority of the introgression occurred 
prior to domestication. We cannot exclude the possibil-
ity of very limited amounts of post-domestication gene 
flow driven by hybridization of Domestic Chickens with 
other species (or hybridization among captive popula-
tions of these species) followed by extensive backcross-
ing. Likewise, we cannot exclude contamination of the 
reference G. gallus genome assembly (ICGSC 2004) with 
some alleles from other species. This could reflect genes 
introgressed during domestication that subsequently 
moved into wild-type G. gallus (given that wild-type G. 
gallus populations are known to have some in recent 
contamination from domesticated chicken; Peterson and 
Brisbin 1998), but it is extremely unlikely that this recent 
introgression explains the observed asymmetric patterns 
we observed in our gene trees. Instead, it is likely that 
Page 12 of 15
Tiley et al. Avian Res            (2020) 11:7 
changes in ranges during the history of Gallus may have 
led to periods of sympatry where hybridization may have 
occurred. The introgression between G. gallus and G. 
varius was also supported by the phylogenetic network 
analyses (Additional file 8: Fig. S3). Considering that the 
excess of quartet frequencies from our gene tree spectra 
analyses supported introgression between G. gallus and 
G. sonneratii to a lesser extent, and that we may not be 
able to identify multiple reticulations involving the same 
edge, it is not surprising that both events were not sup-
ported by the network analyses.
Data type effects are evident in the Gallus radiation
One interesting aspect of genome evolution revealed 
early in phylogenomic era is the extensive incongruence 
observed for individual gene trees. Far from “ending 
incongruence”, as the discussions of early phylogenomic 
papers asserted (Gee 2003), phylogenomics has instead 
heralded a new “beginning of incongruence” (Jeffroy 
et  al. 2006). While processes such as deep coalescence 
were recognized prior to the phylogenomic era (e.g., 
Pamilo and Nei 1988; Maddison 1997), phylogenomics 
has also revealed sources of bias that affect subsets of the 
genome. While we did not identify any data type effects 
on the topology within Gallus, as has been noted previ-
ously (Braun et al. 2019), we observed differences among 
the data type partitions that may explain why exploring 
distinct data partitions can be important.
One explanation for data type effects in birds appears 
to be the greater GC-content variation across species in 
coding exons relative to non-coding regions (Jarvis et al. 
2014; Reddy et al. 2017). Perhaps surprisingly given the 
recent radiation of Gallus species (and thus limited time 
to accumulate differences), we observed greater GC-con-
tent variation for exons than for non-coding regions in 
this study. This observation is consistent with existence 
of a bias toward AT→GC substitutions documented in 
G. gallus (Webster et al. 2006). These biases are gener-
ally thought to reflect GC-biased gene conversion (Mugal 
et  al. 2015; Bolívar et  al. 2019). However, our results 
modify earlier observations of increased GC-content in 
parts of the chicken genome by providing evidence for 
when these shifts might have occurred. Specifically, there 
appear to be biases toward GC substitutions in G. gal-
lus and G. varius (suggesting the bias toward GC is the 
ancestral state for the genus Gallus given our estimate of 
the species tree) along with a bias toward AT in G. lafay-
ettii and G. sonneratii. It seems likely that the lower boot-
strap support for the species tree in the concatenated tree 
for exons (Table 2) reflects, at least in part, these biases 
in the substitution process. However, the shift in base 
composition for introns is very modest and therefore 
unlikely to be an explanation for the topologies differ-
ences observed in previous studies.
A second data type effect is the shorter internal 
branches observed for CNEEs. There is a strong overlap 
between CNEEs and UCEs as classes of genetic elements 
(although we excluded overlapping CNEEs and UCEs in 
this study). Our CNEEs were identified by homology to 
the Edwards et al. (2017) CNEE set, which were trimmed 
to a conserved region (and so averaged ~ 500  bp), 
whereas we identified UCEs by homology to Jarvis et al. 
(2014) who included a short, conserved core (~ 100 bp), 
and then up to 1000  bp of flanking sequence (so most 
were > 2000 bp). Population genomic studies in humans 
indicate that UCE/CNEE core regions are “ultraselected” 
for conservation rather than representing mutational 
cold spots (Katzman et al. 2007); it seems likely that these 
regions are also subject to strong purifying selection in 
birds. This strong purifying selection is expected to result 
in local depression of the effective population size due 
to the Hill and Robertson (1966) effect. If Hill-Robert-
son effects due to strong purifying selection on CNEEs 
explain their conservation, they would be expected to 
have longer coalescent branch lengths in an ASTRAL 
analysis. This is exactly what we observed (Table 3). The 
fact that estimates of coalescent branch lengths obtained 
for the CNEE data were longer than those obtained using 
other data types is especially surprising since we were 
only able to obtain CNEE coalescent branch lengths using 
perfect transversion data. For the other three data types 
estimates of coalescent branch length obtained using pre-
fect transversions were shorter than those obtained using 
gene tree topologies. This suggests that coalescent branch 
lengths are genuinely longer for CNEEs. Mendes and 
Hahn (2017) suggested that internal branches are overes-
timated in concatenated analyses due to the site patterns 
that appear to be homoplastic given the assumption that 
all genomic regions have the same underlying tree topol-
ogy. Hill–Robertson effects would lead to greater agree-
ment among gene trees that are also congruent with the 
species tree, reducing this overestimation.
A corollary of the hypothesis that CNEEs have a locally 
reduced effective population size is that the amount 
of intralocus recombination is sufficient to reduce the 
impact of Hill–Robertson effects in our UCE data. This 
brings up the possibility that intralocus recombination 
could distort our estimates of the species tree (Springer 
and Gatesy 2016; but see Xu and Yang 2016). However, 
the congruence between estimates of the species tree 
generated using ASTRAL on gene trees and those gen-
erated using perfect transversions indicates that intralo-
cus recombination cannot be distorting our topology 
because the transversion data treats each perfect trans-
version site as a partially resolved gene tree. Scoring

biallelic markers as partially resolved is expected to yield 
accurate estimates of coalescent branch lengths as long 
as the markers are truly homoplasy-free (Springer and 
Gatesy 2019). However, our observation that perfect 
transversion branch lengths are shorter than those esti-
mated using gene trees (Table 2) suggests that the trans-
version data are unlikely to be homoplasy-free. Linkage 
among the perfect transversions is also likely to inflate 
the local posterior probabilities calculated by ASTRAL, 
but this is not especially problematic given the high sup-
port observed in the analysis of gene trees. We view the 
use of gene trees and transversions as complementary. 
The ASTRAL tree generated using gene trees is expected 
to be accurate if there is little intralocus recombination, 
but the ASTRAL transversion tree is expected to be more 
accurate if intralocus recombination is very common. 
Since both ASTRAL species trees have identical topolo-
gies, similar branch lengths, and maximal support values, 
we are confident in our inference.
One data type that we did not examine was mitochon-
drial data. Multiple mitochondrial trees for the genus 
Gallus have been published, and they also show conflict-
ing resolutions for the relationship within Gallus (Fig. 2). 
Since the mitochondrial genome is maternally inherited, 
it will have a lower effective population size, and there-
fore a higher probability of congruence with the species 
tree (Moore 1995). Yet none of the mitochondrial topol-
ogies for relationships among Gallus (Fig. 2) match the 
species tree we estimated, even though several of those 
trees were estimated from mitochondrial data collected 
from the same individuals used for the genomes in this 
study. There are many situations that can lead to differ-
ences between mitochondrial and nuclear trees, includ-
ing introgression and incomplete lineage sorting, as well 
as analytical artefacts such as insufficient taxon sampling 
and inadequate model fit (e.g., Meiklejohn et  al. 2014; 
Tamashiro et  al. 2019). Our results suggest introgres-
sion is unlikely, given the limited evidence for gene flow. 
However, simple gene tree–species tree discordance is 
possible. The mitochondrial genome does not recombine 
in birds (Berlin and Ellegren 2001), so it ultimately rep-
resents a single gene tree. However, the simplest hypoth-
esis is topological error. That hypothesis can explain why 
the many published analyses of the mitochondrial data 
have presented different topologies (Fig. 2). The observa-
tion that even studies using complete mitogenomes have 
resulted in alternative topologies within Gallus (Fig.  2) 
further corroborates the hypothesis that estimates of 
mitochondrial gene trees may simply be incorrect. Anal-
yses of mitochondrial data can be challenging (Braun and 
Kimball 2002), and models of sequence evolution used 
in phylogenetic analyses often have a relatively poor fit 
to the data (e.g., Meiklejohn et al. 2014; Tamashiro et al. 
2019). Overall, we believe that the observation that anal-
yses of mitochondrial data fail to converge on a single 
topology provides evidence that estimates of the Gallus 
mitochondrial trees are not correct, and error provides a 
good explanation for the observed discordance with the 
species tree.
Conclusions
Taken as a whole, our results emphasize the need to 
reevaluate prior estimates of avian phylogeny using phy-
logenomic data. The availability of whole genome data 
allowed us to recover a very strongly supported topol-
ogy that was consistent across all analyses (Fig.  3) and 
matched previous studies based on sequence capture of 
UCEs. However, we were also able to significantly extend 
the previous UCE studies by providing evidence both 
for historical introgression and for modest (but detect-
able) data type effects. The observation that coding exons 
exhibit greater GC-content variation than non-coding 
data adds to the body of evidence showing that non-
coding sequences are likely to represent the most useful 
source of information for avian phylogenomics. Overall, 
these phylogenomic analyses provide a rigorous frame-
work for evolution of the genus Gallus and information 
that should be useful for phylogenomic studies in the 
future.
