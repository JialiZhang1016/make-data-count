The crystal structures of eight mono-methyl alkanes have been determined from
single-crystal or high-resolution powder X-ray diffraction using synchrotron
radiation. Mono-methyl alkanes can be found on the cuticles of insects and are
believed to act as recognition pheromones in some social species, e.g. ants, wasps
etc. The molecules were synthesized as pure S enantiomers and are (S)-9-
methylpentacosane, C26H54; (S)-9-methylheptacosane and (S)-11-methylhepta-
cosane,
C28H58;
(S)-7-methylnonacosane,
(S)-9-methylnonacosane,
(S)-11-
methylnonacosane and (S)-13-methylnonacosane, C30H62; and (S)-9-methylhen-
triacontane, C32H66. All crystallize in space group P21. Depending on the
position of the methyl group on the carbon chain, two packing schemes are
observed, in which the molecules pack together hexagonally as linear rods with
terminal and side methyl groups clustering to form distinct motifs. Carbon-chain
torsion angles deviate by less than 10 from the fully extended conformation, but
with one packing form showing greater curvature than the other near the
position of the methyl side group. The crystal structures are optimized by
dispersion-corrected DFT calculations, because of the difﬁculties in reﬁning
accurate structural parameters from powder diffraction data from relatively
poorly crystalline materials.
1. Introduction
The outer cuticle of an insect is covered with a layer of waxy
organic molecules with carbon chain lengths up to around 45
atoms which can include n-alkanes, mono-, di-, tri- and
tetramethyl alkanes, alkenes, dienes, also oxygen-containing
compounds such as alcohols, esters, fatty acids, ketones,
aldehydes etc. For example, Bonavita-Cougourdan et al. (1996)
identiﬁed cholesterol and well over 50 hydrocarbons on the
cuticle of slave ants Formica cunicularia, while Bagne`res &
Morgan (1991) conﬁrmed some 26 hydrocarbon compounds
on the cuticle of the ants Manica rubida. This layer acts as a
barrier to dehydration (Lockey, 1988; Gibbs, 2002) but some
of the molecules can also play a role as recognition pher-
omones, which allow social insects to distinguish their nest
mates from insects of the same species from another nest, or
from related species (e.g. Bagne`res et al., 1996; Cuvillier-Hot et
al., 2001; Dani et al., 2001; Dapporto et al., 2006; Lahav et al.,
1999; Ruther et al., 2002; Singer, 1998; Zanetti et al., 2001). It is
the overall mixture of active compounds – a chemical signa-
ture – that allows speciﬁc insects to be identiﬁed. In some
insects the cuticular hydrocarbon molecules can also be used
to distinguish sex, age and social status.
Dani et al. (2001) noted that dousing paper wasps with n-
alkanes had no apparent effect on kin recognition, whereas
methyl-branched alkanes induced an aggressive response.
Martin & Drijfhout (2009) comment that the wide range and
large quantities of mono-methyl alkanes present on insects
would suggest that they act as general indicators and it is the
smaller quantities of alkenes and dimethylalkanes that are
used to communicate the more complex information of nest-
mate recognition. The differences in chemical properties
between n-alkanes and methyl-branched alkanes are small,
implying that stereochemical factors play a role, e.g. chirality,
position of the methyl group(s) on the carbon chain or
favourable conformations of the molecule allowing interaction
with the insect’s receptors.
Energy-minimization calculations (Goodman, 1997) suggest
that isolated n-alkane molecules adopt a folded conformation
once the length of the chain is greater than 17 C atoms long
because the stabilizing van der Waals interactions between the
—CH2— groups in the folded chain outweigh the energy
required to twist the chain from the preferred extended
conformation. In crystalline n-alkanes, folding occurs with
longer chains of the order of 150 C atoms and above with the
tendency to fold into an integral number of pleats, thus
excluding chain-end imperfections from the interior of the
molecular packing (Ungar et al., 1985).
The crystal structures of methyl-branched alkanes have
received less attention and knowledge of their crystal struc-
tures, molecular packing and preferred conformations is
unclear. The symmetric molecules 20-methylnonatriacontane
(C19H39)2CH(CH3) and 18-methylpentatriacontane (C17H35)2-
CH(CH3), which have the methyl group attached to the
central C atom of the main chain, were described with an
extended
chain
conformation
(Yamamoto
et
al.,
2004;
Ikedou et al., 2005), whereas melt- or solution-crystallization
of the much longer C96H193CH(CH3)C94H189 produced a
once-folded conformation (Ungar & Zeng, 2001). The inﬂu-
ence of the side-chain position on the packing and crystal
structures of methyl alkanes has not been extensively
studied.
As part of a more general investigation into the compounds
found in the cuticular layers of social insects and their action
as recognition pheromones, we synthesized a series of enan-
tiopure mono-methyl alkanes, main chain C25–C31 with the
methyl group at a variety of positions. Here we report their
crystal structures, determined via high-resolution powder
diffraction using synchrotron radiation, with one example
investigated by single-crystal diffraction of limited range,
obtained fortuitously by the appearance of crystals in the
powder specimen. Though solved from the diffraction data by
standard direct methods (for the single crystal) and direct-
space minimization techniques (for the powders), the struc-
tures have been optimized by dispersion-corrected DFT
calculations, because of the difﬁculties of reﬁning accurate
structures from powder diffraction data of limited quality and
d-spacing extent. Two distinct packing arrangements are seen
depending on the position of the methyl group on the carbon
chain.
2. Experimental
2.1. Samples
The S enantiomorphs of eight mono-methyl alkanes were
synthesized using pseudoephedrine as chiral auxiliary (Myers
et al., 1997), i.e. (S)-9-methylpentacosane, C26H54; (S)-9-
methylheptacosane and (S)-11-methylheptacosane, C28H58;
(S)-7-methylnonacosane,
(S)-9-methylnonacosane,
(S)-11-
methylnonacosane and (S)-13-methylnonacosane, C30H62; and
(S)-9-methylhentriacontane, C32H66. The samples were puri-
ﬁed by column chromatography through silica using petro-
leum, hexane or petroleum ether as solvent, to yield soft, waxy,
low-melting-point white solids.
2.2. Powder diffraction
High-resolution powder X-ray diffraction patterns were
measured at wavelengths near 0.8 A˚ using beamline ID31
(Fitch, 2004, 2007) at the ESRF, Grenoble. Samples were
introduced into 1 mm diameter thin-walled borosilicate-glass
capillaries, cooled to 100 K (or 80 K in one instance) with a
nitrogen-gas blower and spun axially to improve powder
averaging. There was no apparent radiation damage during
the measurements. The samples were not all measured during
the same experimental session, and measurements were
repeated following the experience gained using a 2 d X-ray
detector (see below). Hence the data used for the ﬁnal
analyses were not all recorded under exactly the same
conditions, resulting in a range in the statistical quality of the
data (judged by the Rexp values). Generally powder diffraction
patterns were obtained up to 40 2, and were recorded over a
period of up to 3 h.
Because of concerns about the possibility of granularity
effects with the waxy samples which could not be easily
ground before being loaded into the capillaries, measurements
were also made at 120 K with a wavelength of 0.82 A˚ using the
Swiss–Norwegian beamline BM01A, equipped with a two-
dimensional MAR-345 image-plate detector system, to assess
the spottiness (or otherwise) of the Debye–Scherrer rings.
Granularity and texture effects can lead to inaccurate peak
intensities with high-resolution powder data and impede
structural analysis, e.g. as seen in the study of oxanorbornane
(Palin et al., 2007). In addition, the samples were melted and
recrystallized by shock freezing in the cold nitrogen stream to
investigate possible effects on crystal randomization or the
formation of new structural phases. In general, the powder
rings showed that it was possible to obtain diffraction patterns
not unduly affected by powder-averaging problems, but that
this was still a risk. In particular, 7-methylnonacosane (7-
MeC29H59) showed individual diffraction spots from within
the powder, indicating that there were larger crystals present
possibly suitable for a single-crystal measurement.
The high-resolution powder diffraction patterns could be
indexed from the positions of 20 to 30 low-angle peaks using

the singular value decomposition approach (Coelho, 2003)
implemented in the TOPAS analysis suite (Bruker, 2008). All
patterns were indexed with monoclinic cells, space group P21,
Z = 2. It was clear that the samples exhibited two types of unit
cell, distinguished by different b axis lengths of around 7.15
and 4.93 A˚ , respectively.
Structure solutions were attempted from the powder data
by direct-space methods, using simulated annealing and the
program DASH (David et al., 2006). An extended molecule
was introduced into the unit cell and its position (2 degrees of
freedom), orientation (3 degrees of freedom) and carbon-
chain torsion angles (limited to 5 from the staggered 180
conformation) were allowed to vary. Solutions were found for
the three compounds with unit-cell b axis lengths of ’7.15 A˚ .
Following the solution of the structure of 7-methylnonacosane
from the single-crystal pattern (see below), which indicates
greater deviations from a straight molecule than imposed in
the initial analysis, molecules with b cell axis lengths of around
4.93 A˚ were allowed greater freedom in their torsion angles. In
this
way
structures
were
obtained
for
the
remaining
compounds.
Although the basic structures could be solved from the
powder data, Rietveld (1969) reﬁnements were hard to
stabilize. Without extensive restraints on bond distances,
angles and torsions, the molecules distorted from what was
chemically acceptable. This is not surprising given the many
degrees of freedom and the true information content of a
diffraction pattern from a powder of relatively modest crys-
tallinity and effective d-spacing range.
2.3. Single-crystal diffraction
Two
plate-shaped
crystals
of
(S)-7-methylnonacosane,
about 200 mm in diameter and 20 mm thick, were extracted
from the specimen and mounted in oil using a standard 0.3 mm
diameter cryoloop. Both were investigated using beamline
BM01A, giving diffraction patterns of limited range. It was
apparent that one of the crystals was twinned.
The single-crystal diffraction pattern was indexed in a
monoclinic cell similar to that derived from the powder
pattern (see Table 1). The data were integrated and scaled
with the CrysAlis package. Given the wavelength and the
composition, differences between Friedel pairs were negli-
gible. The structure solution and reﬁnement were made via
SIR92 (Altomare et al., 1994) and CRYSTALS (Betteridge et
al., 2003), using only isotropic atomic displacement para-
meters for the C atoms because of the limited extent of the
data. The molecule shows a distinct deviation from linear near
the methyl side group.
3. DFT calculations
It is not unusual that a powder diffraction pattern does not
allow an accurate reﬁnement of the crystal and molecular
structures, even though it may be good enough to solve the
basic molecular packing scheme from a direct-space global-
minimization approach exploiting the known molecular
connectivity. In these circumstances verifying and completing
the structural analysis by quantum-mechanical density func-
tional theory calculations is an attractive option. The use of
dispersion-corrected DFT has been described by van de
Streek & Neumann (2010, 2014), where it served as an
effective check on the accuracy of structures derived from
single-crystal and powder-diffraction studies, respectively.
The DFT program CASTEP (Clark et al., 2005) was used, as
integrated into the Accelrys Materials Studio 6.1 package,
using the PBE functional (Perdew et al., 1996), plane-wave
energy cut-off of 520 eV (as in van de Streek & Neumann,
2010), and including dispersion interactions via the TS scheme
(Tkatchenko & Schefﬂer, 2009). The Materials Studio ‘ultra-
ﬁne’

criteria
were
adopted, with a ﬁnal Cartesian displacement of less than
5  104 A˚ , a maximum force of 0.01 eVA˚ 1 and maximum
energy difference of 5  106 eV per atom. The unit-cell
parameters were ﬁxed at the experimental values. Optimizing
the crystal structure of 7-MeC29H59 starting from the reﬁned
single-crystal model led to a DFT-minimized arrangement in
which the molecules differed by a root-mean-square distance
of 0.019 A˚ (with a maximum deviation of 0.042 A˚ ) for the C
atoms when overlaid using Mercury (Macrae et al., 2008). The
close agreement between the experimental and DFT-mini-
mized structures suggests the experimental crystal structure is
accurate despite the limitations of the data.

The structures obtained from powder data are less accurate,
so as a test the calculation for 7-MeC29H59 was repeated after
straightening the molecule so that all C—C—C—C main-
chain torsion angles were 180. Starting from this conﬁgura-
tion and optimizing following the same procedure produced a
structure with slightly poorer agreement with the single-
crystal structure with a r.m.s. distance of 0.054 A˚
and a
maximum distance of 0.132 A˚ . This level of agreement is still
better than the average r.m.s. deviation of 0.084 A˚ reported by
van de Streek & Neumann (2010) for the 241 ordered mole-
cular crystal structures they tested. The two DFT-minimized
structures differed by an r.m.s. distance of 0.044 A˚ and a
maximum distance of 0.097 A˚ , indicating close agreement
between DFT-minimized structures even when starting from
modestly different conformations.
If the unit-cell dimensions were also allowed to vary there
was an anisotropic contraction, with cell axes reducing by
between 1% and 3.5%, accompanied by an increase in the
monoclinic angle from 90.30 (1) to 91.8. DFT calculations
are carried out on a structure at 0 K. It is not evident whether
the extent of this unit cell contraction reﬂects what the lattice
parameters actually are at 0 K (not having measured the
diffraction pattern at very low temperature), or whether it
reveals shortcomings in the DFT calculation. Whatever the
balance between these, the effect on the conformation of the
molecule is slight, but nevertheless results in a net improve-
ment in the agreement between the single-crystal and DFT-
minimized
molecules
to
an
r.m.s.
distance
of
0.026 A˚
(maximum 0.062 A˚ ), Table S2. This represents the best
agreement between the single-crystal and DFT-D-minimized
molecules starting from the fully straightened conformation.
For the powder-derived structures therefore, the C—C—
C—C torsion angles were reset to 180 and the same DFT-D
calculations performed, including optimization of the unit-cell
parameters. The DFT-optimized molecule was taken as a rigid
body and a ﬁnal ﬁne tune of the structure performed via the
Rietveld method with TOPAS by a rigid-body optimization (3
rotations and 2 translations), as returning the lattice para-
meters from the DFT-minimized values (at 0 K) to the
powder-diffraction values (at 80 or 100 K) moves the
symmetry-related molecules slightly in space with respect to
each other. The rigid-body reﬁnement allows compensation
for this. The powder diffraction peaks were described with the
Voigt function. Also included in the ﬁt were the scale factor,
three lattice parameters, 2 zero point correction, background
parameters, a full-axial model for peak asymmetry due to axial
divergence, a Stephens (1999) microstrain model for aniso-
tropic peak broadening for all patterns except 9Me-C29H59
(which exhibited signiﬁcant isotropic microstrain broadening),
an overall isotropic atomic displacement parameter (Biso), and
a March–Dollase correction (Dollase, 1986) for preferred
orientation along 100 or 001 for the type-2 structures (b ’
4.93 A˚ ) except 9-MeC25H51 for which, like type-1 structures,
no correction was needed.
4. Results
4.1. Single crystal
The crystal structure of (S)-7-methylnonacosane is shown in
Fig. 1. The molecule is close to straight, but has a distinct curve
around the position of the methyl side chain resulting from
changes in the carbon-chain torsion angles by up to 9.2 (3)
away from 180, illustrated in Fig. 2. Also shown are the
torsion angles for the DFT-optimized molecule starting from
the straightened conﬁguration, showing the correspondence
between the values. The DFT calculations appear to under-
estimate somewhat the deviations from 180 near the side
group on the longer-chain side of the molecule. It is not clear
what causes this, but nevertheless the overall agreement is
acceptable, with an r.m.s. deviation between C atoms of

(as noted above). Note that this curving of the
molecule, matching closely the crystallographic result, arises
spontaneously in the DFT calculation. A full list of carbon–
carbon bond distances, angles and torsions is given in
supplementary Table S1.
4.2. Powder refinements
The results of the Rietveld ﬁts with the DFT-optimized
molecules are summarized in Table 2. The R-factors and plots
of observed and calculated proﬁles indicate that the structures
are consistent with the experimental powder diffraction
patterns, shown for 7-MeC29H59 as an example in Fig. 3; the
others are shown in the supporting information.
5. Discussion
There are two distinct packing arrangements. In the ﬁrst type,
corresponding to the structures with b ’ 7.15 A˚ , the molecules
are quite straight. The maximum deviation of the C—C—C—
C torsion angles near the methyl group from the fully
extended staggered conformation is less than 3.2, e.g. see Fig.
4 illustrating the structure of 11-MeC29H59. For the second
type of packing, b ’ 4.93 A˚ , the molecules are still very much
extended; however, torsion angles near the methyl group
deviate more, with a maximum twist of between 8.2 and 9.1
[9.2 (3) by single-crystal] for the molecules studied, e.g. 9-
MeC29H59, Fig. 5, or 7-MeC29H59, Fig. 1. It appears that if the
ratio of the number of C atoms in the longer and shorter sub-
chains on either side of the chiral centre (Cl/Cs) is less than 2,

packing of type 1 is observed, otherwise it is of type 2 (see
Table 2). Thus, for the molecules studied here, molecules with
the methyl group attached to the main chain within three C
atoms of its central carbon adopt packing type 1, while those
with the methyl group attached beyond four C atoms from the
centre adopt packing type 2, with four C atoms representing
the transition between structure types, illustrated by consid-
ering 11-MeC29H59, type 1, and 9-MeC25H51, type 2.
In both structural types, the molecules pack hexagonally
like rods to maximize the stabilization afforded by the van der
Waals interactions, Fig. 6. Side-chain and terminal methyl
groups correlate to form distinct clusters integrated into the
overall side-by-side packing. Average rod-like centre-to-
centre distances of neighbouring molecules are given in Table
2. For type 1, molecules are aligned parallel to [201], posi-
tioned close to midway between (204) lattice planes. A
molecule has two neighbouring molecules on either side, at the
same y value, at an average centre-to-centre distance of d102
(4.89  4.91 A˚ for the three compounds studied) and four 21-
screw-related rods in layers above and below (y  1
2) at an
average distance of 1
2(d2
102 + b2)1/2 (4.33–4.34 A˚ ). Thus the
hexagonal packing of the rods is mildly elongated in one
direction (parallel to the ac plane) with two longer and four
shorter distances between centres. Similar considerations hold
for the type-2 packing, in which the molecules align parallel to
[102] (for the four 9-MeCnH2n + 1 structures), with molecules
positioned close to midway between (402) planes. However,
there are now two neighbouring molecules at b (4.93–
4.94 A˚ ) with the four others at an average distance of 1
2(d2
201 +
b2)1/2 (4.25–4.28 A˚ ). Thus, with respect to the monoclinic b
axis, the elongation of the hexagonal packing arrangement is
rotated by 90 compared with type 1. When considering the
hexagon of neighbouring molecules surrounding a central rod,
in type 1 packing the methyl group is pointing towards the
vertex of a hexagon and is parallel to the direction of elon-
gation. In type 2 packing, the methyl group is pointing towards
an edge and is perpendicular to the direction of elongation of
the hexagon. In both packing types, the C–methyl bond lies
close to parallel to the ac plane. Figs. 7 and 8 show space-ﬁlling
views of the packing of the molecules for both structural types.

packing of rods. The main chain C atoms all lie close to a plane (as C—
C—C—C torsion angles deviate from 180 by less than 10) leading to
distortion of the packing from perfect hexagonal, being elongated in (a)
parallel to the ac plane, and in (b) perpendicular to the ac plane.
For the single-crystal structure of 7-MeC29H59 the molecules in
the chosen setting of the unit cell, with the least-obtuse 
angle, are aligned parallel to [103] [so molecules are midway
between (602) planes], but the unit cell can be transformed to
be more easily comparable with the other type-2 structures via
a0 ¼ a  c followed by a translation of the molecules by 1
2 c.
Each structure type has a distinct cluster of side and
terminal methyl groups integrated into the overall side-by-side
molecular packing scheme that is closely reproduced by the
members of each series of molecules. Fig. 9 shows the super-
position of the four 9-MeCnH2n + 1 type-2 structures. The
length of the c axis increases by less than 0.4% between 9-
MeC25H51 and 9-MeC31H63; the increasing length of the
molecules is accommodated by increasing a and . Fig. 10
shows the superposition of 9-MeC29H59 and 7-MeC29H59
which gives an idea about the effect of the methyl group
position while maintaining the overall chain length. Fig. 11
shows the overlay of the type-1 structures. Again the close
resemblance of the packing of the methyl groups for each
substance can be seen.
6. Conclusion
Two molecular packing schemes are seen for the eight mole-
cules studied here, depending on the position of the methyl
side group on the main carbon chain. If the methyl group is
towards the centre of the molecule, so that the ratio of the
lengths of the two carbon chains on either side of the chiral
centre is less than 2, type 1 packing is observed, otherwise type
2 packing is found. The molecules pack together hexagonally
as extended rods with deviations of the carbon-chain torsion
angles of less than 10 from the fully extended conformation.
Type-2 structures show a deﬁnite curve of the chain near the
position of the methyl side group. The side-branch and
terminal methyl groups of adjacent molecules are arranged
together to form distinct clusters that are accommodated
within the overall packing of the molecules.
The use of DFT-D optimization of the structures, following
the overall approach of van de Streek & Neumann (2010,
2014), provides a consistent and well deﬁned method to
optimize the crystal structures, and avoids the large number of
stereochemical restraints that would be necessary to obtain a
chemically acceptable structure from the powder-diffraction
data alone. Comparing the molecule obtained from the single-
crystal study with that obtained from the DFT-D minimization

shows good r.m.s. distance agreement between the two, and
comparison with the powder diffraction pattern gives very
similar ﬁts. Fitting the DFT-D minimized molecule to the
powder pattern yields an Rwp of 0.0474 (Table 2), while taking
the ﬁxed single-crystal atomic coordinates and displacement
parameters yields a similar ﬁt, with an Rwp of 0.0502, which
reduces to 0.0488 if an overall isotropic temperature factor is
reﬁned in place of ﬁxed single-crystal values, as for the DFT-
optimized model.
Although stereochemical restraints should be reliable for
bond distances and angles in the powder diffraction reﬁne-
ments, there is no obvious information on what the carbon-
chain torsion angles should be for these compounds, and
indeed the single-crystal derived structure showed signiﬁcant
deviations from perfectly staggered conformations, Fig. 2.
Applying a generalized torsion restraint soft enough to allow
the largest deviations from the perfectly staggered confor-
mation is not rigid enough to hold in check the rest of the
chain so that restraints would need to be speciﬁcally tailored
along the chain, requiring essentially that the arrangement be
known in advance. In contrast, the DFT-D approach repro-
duces the curved molecule for type-2 structures, and a
straighter form for type-1 structures, in a chemically credible
way, and yields calculated powder diffraction patterns that
match those measured experimentally.
