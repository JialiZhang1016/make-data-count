Abstract
Soil nutrient availability, invasive plants, and insect presence can directly alter
ecosystem structure and function, but less is known about how these factors
may interact. In this 6-year study in an old-ﬁeld ecosystem, we manipulated
insect abundance (reduced and control), the propagule pressure of an invasive
nitrogen-ﬁxing plant (propagules added and control), and soil nutrient avail-
ability (nitrogen added, nitrogen reduced and control) in a fully crossed, com-
pletely randomized plot design. We found that nutrient amendment and,
occasionally, insect abundance interacted with the propagule pressure of an
invasive plant to alter above- and belowground structure and function at our
site. Not surprisingly, nutrient amendment had a direct effect on aboveground
biomass and soil nutrient mineralization. The introduction of invasive nitro-
gen-ﬁxing plant propagules interacted with nutrient amendment and insect
presence to alter soil bacterial abundance and the activity of the microbial com-
munity. While the larger-scale, longer-term bulk measurements such as biomass
production and nutrient mineralization responded to the direct effects of our
treatments, the shorter-term and dynamic microbial communities tended to
respond to interactions among our treatments. Our results indicate that soil
nutrients, invasive plants, and insect herbivores determine both above- and
belowground responses, but whether such effects are independent versus inter-
dependent varies with scale.
Introduction
Decades of research demonstrate that soil nutrient avail-
ability, invasive plants, and insect abundance can alter the
structure of aboveground communities (Mack et al. 2000;
Suding et al. 2005; Ehrenfeld 2010; Fisher et al. 2013). In
general, nitrogen (N) limitation increases net primary
productivity, decreases plant diversity, and thus alters
community
and
ecosystem
structure
(Cleland
and
Harpole 2010). Similarly, the invasion of non-native
plants in a community can reduce plant diversity and
increase plant biomass by more than 50% relative to
uninvaded
communities
(Vila
et al.
2011).
Insect
presence, on average, leads to around a 13% reduction in
NPP and causes changes in plant community structure
sometimes promoting while other times hindering plant
diversity (Hunter 2001; Coupe and Cahill 2003). While it
is clear that main and interactive effects of invasive plant
species, insect abundance, and soil nutrient availability
can shape aboveground plant community structure and
function, fewer studies have examined how these factors,
solely or in concert, affect the belowground components
of ecosystems (Bardgett and Wardle 2010).
Although the above- and belowground compartments
of ecosystems are often linked (Wardle et al. 2004),
belowground responses to these key factors may not

simply mirror aboveground responses (Van Der Putten
et al. 2001; Wardle et al. 2004). Independently, invasive
plants can change the abundance and type of resources
made available to the soil microbial pool and thus alter
both the composition of microbial communities and asso-
ciated functions such as microbial enzymatic activity and
respiration (Hollinger 1986; Kourtev et al. 2002). Addi-
tionally, via their effects on plant quality and production,
insects can alter soil communities and their function by
selectively consuming plant material, altering plant chem-
istry, or by altering frass and waste inputs (Hunter 2001;
Frost and Hunter 2004; Classen et al. 2006). Finally,
changes in soil nutrient availability can alter soil micro-
bial community composition and function, either by
directly altering resources made available for mineraliza-
tion by belowground communities, or by indirectly alter-
ing plant community composition, which may shift the
quality and quantity of plant inputs to the soil (Waldrop
et al. 2004). Numerous studies show that the addition of
nutrients to the soil can shift the composition of the
microbial community (Ramirez et al. 2010; Zechmeister-
Boltenstern et al. 2011) potentially altering microbial func-
tion as well. Overall, invasive species, nutrients, and insect
presence can alter belowground community structure and
function affecting associated ecosystem processes.
Few studies, to our knowledge, have examined how
these three key drivers of plant community structure
and ecosystem function – invasive plant species, above-
ground insects, and soil nutrient availability – interact
to shape both above- and belowground
community
structure, function, and associated ecosystem processes.
In this study, we examined the main and interactive
effects of these drivers on above- and belowground com-
munity structure and ecosystem function after 6 years of
experimentally manipulating the abundance of invasive
plant propagules entering the system (at two levels),
insect presence (at two levels), and soil nitrogen avail-
ability (at three levels) in an old-ﬁeld ecosystem in the
eastern United States. Previous work at this site found
that soil nutrient availability interacted with propagule
supply to alter the production of an invasive nitrogen-
ﬁxing plant (Sanders et al. 2007). When herbivores and
nutrients were reduced, the biomass of a nitrogen-ﬁxing
shrub increased (Sanders et al. 2007). Given plant bio-
mass production, which is inﬂuenced by propagule addi-
tion, insect abundance, and nutrient amendments can
directly and interactively alter soil microbial communi-
ties, it is difﬁcult to predict how belowground commu-
nities
will
respond
to
our
treatments.
Broadly,
we
predict that nutrient amendment will have a large and
direct effect on plant production and nutrient minerali-
zation increasing carbon inputs into the soil system
thus inﬂuencing belowground community structure and
function. Consequently, the interactive effects of invasive
propagules and insects will inﬂuence ﬁne-scale below-
ground community structure and function in the con-
text of large carbon inputs.
Methods
In 2004, we established a multifactor experiment in an
intact old ﬁeld located on the Oak Ridge National Envi-
ronmental Research Park, Tennessee (35°58′N 84°17′W).
The site was abandoned from agricultural use in 1943
and has been managed since 2003 with an annual mowing
regime. Soil at the site is Typic Hapludult, which has a
silty clay-loam texture, is slightly acidic, and drains mod-
erately well (Phillips et al. 2001). The three most com-
mon
plant
species,
Verbesina
occidentalis,
Verbesina
virginica, and Solidago altissima, make up ~40% of the
plant biomass, and there are approximately 60 other sub-
dominant herbaceous, graminoid, and woody native and
exotic species, including Lespedeza cuneata (Sanders et al.
2007; Blue et al. 2011; Souza et al. 2011a,b) at the site. In
2004, we erected 3-m-tall deer fence around the site and
established 72 3 9 3 m plots, including a 0.5-m buffer
around each plot, at a spacing of 2 m among plots,
within existing vegetation at the site. Each spring, we
manipulated the density of invasive plant propagules,
insect abundance, and soil nutrient availability in a fully
crossed, completely randomized design (Fig. 1; n = 6 for
each treatment combination).
From 2004 to 2006, we manipulated the propagules of
an invasive nitrogen-ﬁxing plant, Lespedeza cuneata, by
adding 1700 seedsm2 with a seed spreader to 36 ran-
domly selected plots (Ernst Conservation Seeds, Mead-
ville, PA). The density of L. cuneata, a Rank 1 invasive

species, was ~6 9 higher in the seed addition plots than
in nonaddition plots (Sanders et al. 2007).
From 2004 to 2009, we manipulated insect presence and
absence by applying permethrin insecticide (Hi-Yield
Kill-A-Bug, Voluntary Purchasing Group, Bonham, TX) to
36 randomly selected plots. Using a backpack sprayer,
0.23 Lm2 of insecticide was added every 2–3 weeks to
insect-removal
plots
during
the
growing
season.
Permethrin, a synthetic pyrethroid-based insecticide, is
widely used in ecological studies (e.g., Root 1996; Schmitz
et al. 2006). Using a combination of sweep netting, vacuum
sampling, and visual scanning, we found that insect
abundance was on average 4 9 lower in the insect-reduced
plots (6.6 individuals m2) relative to the control plots
(28.4 individuals m2; Sanders et al. 2007). Based on
observations at the ﬁeld site since 2004 (Lane 2006; Sanders
et al. 2007; Crutsinger et al. 2013) and detailed studies on
plant–insect interactions conducted at the site (Crawford
et al. 2007; Crutsinger et al. 2013), we are conﬁdent that
herbivores were by far the most abundant trophic group.
For example, Lane (2006) surveyed the insect community
at the site for 2 years using a series of standard techniques
and found that herbivores made up >56% of the total
abundance of arthropods at the site. Additionally, of the
insect taxa that were most frequently detected in the insect-
reduced plots, only one was herbivorous – an aphid that
proved difﬁcult for us to remove or reduce using the insec-
ticide treatment and vacuum sampler. Finally, several pilot
experiments demonstrated that neither plant growth nor
NO3-N and NH4-N in the soil solution differed between
insect-reduced and control plots (Sanders et al. 2007).
Thus, we are convinced that our use of permethrin insecti-
cide reduced aboveground herbivore loads in the plots and
that it had limited, if any, effects on soil nutrient dynamics
in the plots.
From 2004 to 2009, we manipulated soil nutrient avail-
ability by doing nothing (control), adding nitrogen to
increase
nitrogen
availability,
and
adding
carbon
to
reduce nitrogen availability. Nitrogen was added as urea
fertilizer (20 gm2year1), and carbon was applied as
sucrose (167 gm2year1) (Sanders et al. 2007; Blue
et al. 2011; Souza et al. 2011a,b). Sucrose, which is ~46%
carbon, is quickly mineralized by microbial communities;
thus, its addition reduced soil nitrogen availability in our
plots (Wang et al. 2004; Craine et al. 2007; Sanders et al.
2007). Relative to control plots, soil nitrogen availability
(NO3-N + NH4-N) was 2 9 higher in nitrogen-added
plots and 5 9 lower in carbon-added plots (P < 0.0001;
Sanders et al. 2007). Urea fertilization increased NO3-N
and NH4-N availability (P < 0.0001), whereas carbon fer-
tilization
decreased
NO3-N
availability
(P < 0.0001)
but had no effect on NH4-N availability (P = 0.50;
Blue et al. 2011). Nutrient application rates were similar
to fertilization rates used in other experiments (Mclendon
and Redente 1992; Siemann 1998).
To assess how the plant community responded to the
treatments, we harvested aboveground plant biomass at
the end of the growing season in 2009. We randomly
placed a 0.5 m 9 1 m quadrat near the center of each of
the 72 plots and clipped all of the aboveground plant
biomass to ground level. We separated Lespedeza from
the biomass of other species; biomass was oven-dried for
approximately 48 h at 60°C and weighed.
To assess the structure and function of the soil com-
munity and the soil properties that might inﬂuence it, we
collected two sets of soil samples (0–10 cm depth, 5 cm
diameter) randomly from each plot in July, 2009. Soils
collected for molecular analysis (~15 g) were immediately
frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at 80°C until
analysis. Soil samples for other analyses were returned to
the laboratory, homogenized by plot, and sieved to
2 mm.
We
measured
the
gravimetric
water
content
(GWC) on each plots sample by oven drying ~20 g of soil
at 105°C for ~48 h. We measured pH on ~10 g of dry
soil with 0.01 mol L1 CaCl2 (Robertson et al. 1999).
Bacterial and fungal relative abundance (gene copy
number) were measured using qPCR (see Castro et al.
2010). DNA from each sample was extracted using the
UltraClean soil DNA isolation kit (MoBio Laboratories,
Carlsbad, CA). DNA concentration and purity were evalu-
ated using a microplate reader (Biotek Instruments,
Winooski, VT). PCR for bacteria, 16S rRNA, was per-
formed using bacterial primers Eub 338 (ACT CCT ACG
GGA GGC AGC AGZ) (Lane 1991) and Eub 518 (ATT
ACC GCG GCT GCT GG) (Muyzer et al. 1993). PCR for
fungi, 18S rRNA, was performed using fungal primers
nuSSU1196F (GGA AAC TCA CCA GGT CCA GA) and
nuSSU1536R (ATT GCA ATG CYC TAT CCC CA)
(Borneman and Hartin 2000). In each PCR, abundance
for bacteria and fungi was quantiﬁed by comparing
unknown samples to serial dilutions of 16S and 18S
rRNA from Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
respectively. PCR mixtures for both 16S and 18S rRNA
ampliﬁcations contained 15 lL of SYBR green master mix
(Invitrogen by Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California),
5 lmol of the corresponding primer (Euroﬁns mwg
operon Huntsville, Alabama), and 1 lL of DNA diluted
1:10 with sterile water. All reactions were brought to a
ﬁnal volume of 30 lL with sterile water. Ampliﬁcation
protocol for the 16S rRNA gene consisted of an initial
denaturing cycle of 95°C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles
of 95°C for 15 sec, 53°C for 15 sec, and 72°C for 1 min.
Ampliﬁcation for the18S rRNA gene consisted of an ini-
tial denaturing cycle of 95°C for 3 min, followed by 40

products upon completion of the PCR cycle to ensure the
purity of the ampliﬁcation product. We measured ﬂuores-
cence of the products after each cycle using a 96-well
Chromo

thermocycler
(Bio-Rad
Laboratories).
We
present all data as gene copy number per gram of dry soil
(Strickland and Rousk 2010).
We assayed microbial activity and function within 48 h
of
sample
collection
using
methylumbelliferone
(MUB)-linked substrates for three soil enzymes important
in
carbon,
nitrogen,
and
phosphorus
degradation:
b-glucosidase,
N-acetylglucosaminidase
(nagase),
and
phosphatase, respectively. Sample suspensions were pre-
pared by adding ~1 g of soil to 125 mL of 50 mmol L1,
pH 5.0, sodium acetate buffer. Soil suspensions were mixed
on a stir plate for 2 min, while 96-well plates were prepared
with blank wells, substrate controls, soil negative controls,
reference standards, and quench controls. All plates were
incubated at room temperature in the dark. Nagase and
phosphatase reactions were incubated for 0.5 h, while the
ß-glucosidase reaction was incubated for 2 h (Saiya-Cork
et al. 2002; Sinsabaugh et al. 2005). Reactions were stopped
by
adding
25 lL
of
0.5 mol L1
sodium
hydroxide
(NaOH). Fluorescence was measured using a Modulus
ﬂuorometer (Turner Biosystems, Sunnyvale, CA) at an
excitation of 365 nm and an emission of 450 nm. Potential
enzymatic activity was reported as nmolh1g1.
Potential soil nitrogen mineralization, nitriﬁcation, and
ammoniﬁcation were measured using laboratory incuba-
tions (Robertson et al. 1999). Collected soils were brought
up to ﬁeld capacity, and an initial sample was immedi-
ately extracted with 2 mol L1 KCL. Another sample was
incubated at laboratory temperatures in dark 1-quart
Mason jars. Each chamber contained a soil sample and a
small vial of water to maintain humidity, and each cham-
ber was ﬂushed with air every 3–7 days. After 28 days, we
removed the soils from the incubation and extracted
them with 2 mol L1 KCL. Extracts were analyzed for
NO3-N and NH4-N on a Westco Smart Chem Auto
Analyzer
(Westco
Scientiﬁc,
Brookﬁeld,
CT).
Initial
inorganic nitrogen pools were subtracted from the incu-
bated pools to estimate potential nitrogen mineralization.
For each response variable, we analyzed the main and
interactive effects of invasive plants, insect presence, and
soil nutrient availability using an analysis of variance
(ANOVA). Data were log-transformed when they violated
the assumptions of ANOVA, but data shown in the text
and ﬁgures are untransformed means. We used Tukey’s
HSD
means
separation
test
(a = 0.05)
to
identify
whether treatment means differed from one another when
necessary.
Results
Total aboveground plant biomass varied threefold among
treatments (Fig. 2, Table 1). Total aboveground biomass
was 44% higher in nitrogen-added and 35% higher in con-
trol plots relative to nitrogen-reduced plots. Aboveground
biomass was 15% higher in Lespedeza propagule-added
plots than in plots where propagules were not added
(Table 1). When we excluded Lespedeza biomass from the
total aboveground biomass estimate, the effect of adding
invasive propagules on aboveground biomass of the rest of
the plant community disappeared (Table 1, P = 0.39).
Reducing insect abundance did not alter aboveground bio-
mass, and none of the interaction terms were signiﬁcant.
Interactions among the treatments altered bacterial
abundance, but there were no direct or interactive effects
of our treatments on fungal abundance or on the fungal/
bacterial ratio (Fig. 3; Table 2). When insect abundances
were reduced, the addition of invasive plant propagules
lowered bacterial abundance by 28%; however, when
insect abundance was not reduced, there was no effect.
There was also an interaction between nutrient amend-
ment and invasive plant propagules such that when nitro-
gen was reduced, the addition of invasive propagules
reduced bacterial abundance by 52% relative to the nitro-
gen-reduced plots where invasive propagules were not
added.

Soil microbial b-glucosidase activity, which is responsi-
ble for releasing glucose molecules for microbial use,
varied almost ﬁvefold among treatments (Table 2, Fig. 4).
Nutrient
amendment
and
invasive
plant
propagule
addition interacted such that b-glucosidase activity was
3 9 higher in nitrogen-reduced plots when seeds of
Lespedeza were added than in the control or nitrogen-
added plots (Table 2, Fig. 4). Phosphatase activity, which
removes phosphate groups from a variety of substrates to
meet microbial needs for phosphorus, varied ﬁvefold
among treatments (Table 2). Phosphatase activity was
2 9 higher in the nitrogen-reduced plots than in the
control or nitrogen-added plots, and phosphatase activity
was 16% lower in invasive plant addition plots than in
the plots to which invasive species were not added
(Table 2, Fig. 4). Nutrient amendment and the addition
of invasive plant propagules interacted to alter soil nagase
activity. Propagule addition decreased nagase activity
~5%, but in nitrogen-reduced plots, propagule addition
increased nagase activity.
As predicted, the addition of soil nutrients altered
potential soil net nitrogen mineralization and nitriﬁcation
rates. Net mineralization and nitriﬁcation rates were
4 9 higher in soils from nitrogen-added plots than in
soils from nitrogen-reduced plots (Table 2, Fig. 5). There
were no effects of either insect reduction or the addition
of invasive plant species on net nitriﬁcation or net
mineralization rates, nor were there any interactive effects.
Net ammoniﬁcation rates did not vary among treatments
(Table 2, Fig. 5). Soil gravimetric water content was up
to 13% higher in the nitrogen-reduced plots than in the
nitrogen-added and control plots (F11,71 = 1.8, P = 0.07).
Soil pH did not vary among treatments (F11,71 = 0.74,
P = 0.70).

invasive plants to alter ecosystem structure and function.
Our study found that nutrient status and, occasionally,
insect abundance interacted with the propagule pressure of
an invasive plant to alter the above- and belowground
structure and function of an old-ﬁeld ecosystem. Not sur-
prisingly and as predicted, nutrient amendment had a
direct effect on aboveground biomass and soil nutrient
mineralization; however, the introduction of Lespedeza
propagules interacted with nutrient amendment and to
a lesser extent insect abundance to alter soil bacterial
abundance and the function of the microbial community.

nitrogen-reduced plots than in the control or nitrogen-added plots,
and phosphatase activity was 16% lower in invasive plant propagule-
added plots than in the plots where propagules were not added.
When nitrogen was reduced, propagule addition increased nagase

biomass production and nutrient mineralization appear to
be coupled and respond to direct effects of our treatments,
while the microbial community, with more rapid turnover
times, responds to interactions among our treatments.
As is often the case in other experiments, nutrient
availability controlled both aboveground biomass and
soil nutrient mineralization in our experiment but in
different directions (Vitousek et al. 1997; Perez et al.
1998; Sirulnik et al. 2007; Cleland and Harpole 2010).
Interestingly, adding nitrogen to plots did not control
soil nitrogen production or mineralization; both of these
processes were different only relative to the nutrient-
reduced plots. We suspect that potential nitriﬁcation
increased as nitrogen was added to plots because the
microbial communities in soils exceeded their demand
for nitrogen (Zeglin et al. 2007). Eventually, nitrogen
saturation (Agren and Bosatta 1988) was reached result-
ing in a stagnation of productivity, carbon storage, and
increased leaching of nitrogen (Vitousek et al. 1997).
Total biomass in our control plots did not differ signiﬁ-
cantly from that in the nitrogen-added plots indicating
that nitrogen saturation may have already occurred in
this ecosystem (i.e., these communities were not N-lim-
ited).
Contrary
to
other
studies
that
ﬁnd
nitrogen
enrichment results in an early increase in ammoniﬁca-
tion followed by a plateau (Aber et al. 1995) as soil
microbial communities become carbon limited (Micks
et al. 2004), we found no effects of nitrogen amend-
ments on potential ammoniﬁcation (Lovett and Rueth
1999; Baron et al. 2000).
Nitrogen reduction decreased aboveground biomass
(e.g., carbon input) relative to unamended and nitrogen-
added plots, which did not differ from each other. This
pattern, where nitrogen addition did not alter above-
ground biomass production, was consistent even when we
removed Lespedeza biomass from our analysis, indicating
that nitrogen reduction lowers production relative to
nitrogen addition in control plots irrespective of invasion
by Lespedeza. Nutrient reduction at our site also reduced
belowground root biomass, indicating that when nutrients
were low, plant carbon allocation to the soil and the
microbial community which lived there was also low
(Blue et al. 2011).
Bacterial abundance was higher when Lespedeza propa-
gules were added to control plots, but lower when propa-
gules were added to plots where nitrogen was reduced.
When nitrogen was added, there was no effect of propa-
gule
addition
on
bacterial
abundance.
These
results
suggest that in control plots, which were more productive
with greater plant inputs than nitrogen-reduced plots, the
introduction
of
nitrogen-ﬁxing
Lespedeza
propagules
reduced nutrient constraints on the bacterial community,
thereby increasing bacterial abundance. Since an increase
in nitrogen-ﬁxer abundance can alleviate nitrogen con-
straints on ecosystems, bacterial abundance might also
increase (Selmants et al. 2005). However, the stimulating
effect of Lespedeza goes away in the less productive nitro-
gen-reduced plots where plant inputs were lower but car-
bon addition as sucrose was higher. While we were
unable to tease apart exactly how nutrient amendment
and the presence of Lespedeza in plots interact to shape
soil communities, we have a working hypothesis: changes
in plant composition lead to shifts in the structure of soil
communities.

Shifts in plant species composition can change carbon
allocation to the rhizosphere community leading to shifts
in microbial community abundance and composition
(Wardle et al. 2003; Innes et al. 2004; Hossain et al. 2010;
Ladygina and Hedlund 2010), especially when an ecosys-
tem is invaded by a nitrogen-ﬁxing species (Vitousek and
Walker 1989). Because Lespedeza is a nitrogen-ﬁxer, it
has a unique community of organisms that occur in its
rhizosphere (Kalburtji et al. 2001; Min et al. 2008), thus,
as belowground root and exudate abundance from Lespe-
deza
increases
relative
to
other
non-nitrogen-ﬁxing
species in the community, bacterial abundance might shift
(Batten et al. 2008; Yannarell et al. 2011). Previous work
in a similar ecosystem found that the presence of Lespe-
deza altered soil nematode composition relative to other
plant species (Kardol et al. 2010), suggesting that the
presence of Lespedeza not only changed the bacterial
community, but can change the entire soil food web
mediating not only bottom-up (e.g., litter phenolics and
root exudates) but also top-down (e.g., bacterivorous
nematodes) factors inﬂuencing soil community structure.
Insects, speciﬁcally herbivores, can alter plant inputs
into soil communities via their direct impact on plant
function (e.g., secondary chemistry and reduced biomass)
or by causing a shift in plant community composition
(Hillebrand et al. 2007; Gruner et al. 2008). We found that
when insects were reduced, bacterial abundance declined
28%, but only when Lespedeza propagules were added. We
predicted that decreasing insect abundance would increase
carbon allocation belowground, stimulating the microbial
community. However, we did not ﬁnd this pattern. In
2004, Lespedeza biomass was sevenfold higher in plots
where insects were removed, propagules were added, and
nutrients were reduced (Sanders et al. 2007). Lespedeza lit-
ter has high concentrations of phenolic compounds that
can retard the growth of microbial communities, and thus,
as Lespedeza increases in abundance in insect-reduced
plots relative to other plant species bacterial abundance
may decrease (Kalburtji et al. 1999, 2001; Min et al. 2008;
Yannarell et al. 2011). While we cannot tease apart the
presence of Lespedeza and the removal of insects on soil
bacterial abundance, they interact in counter-intuitive ways
to inﬂuence belowground bacterial communities.
While bacterial responses differed among treatments in
our experiment, fungal responses did not. In spite of a
number of studies showing strong responses of fungi to
plant invasion (Van Der Putten et al. 2007; Yannarell
et al. 2011), previous work on Lespedeza and invasion by
other nitrogen-ﬁxers showed that, relative to bacterial
communities, fungal communities were less responsive to
Lespedeza presence (Yannarell et al. 2011; St John et al.
2012). In addition, fungal-dominated food webs can take
many years to fully develop and are more common in
later-successional ecosystems (Wardle 2002). Given the
old ﬁeld we worked in was managed by mowing and was
not limited by soil moisture, we suspect that a bacterial-
driven energy channel dominated over a fungal energy
channel (Witt and Set€al€a 2010) – a pattern found in other
studies examining the presence of nitrogen-ﬁxers in early
successional ecosystems (St John et al. 2012).
Changes in bacterial and fungal abundance can indicate
that biomass of the community was changing in response
to experimental manipulations, but activity and function
of that community might not change in tandem (Sinsab-
augh
et al.
2008).
We
examined
three
extracellular
enzyme activities that were responsible for the breakdown
of organic matter in soils (b-glucosidase) or play a key
role in soil nitrogen and phosphorus cycling (nagase and
phosphatase) (Sinsabaugh et al. 2005). b-Glucosidase and
nagase activity were higher when propagules of Lespedeza
were added to plots where nutrients were reduced, but
activities of both enzymes were lower in plots where
propagules of Lespedeza were added to plots where nutri-
ents were not manipulated. While there was no statistical
interaction
between
propagule
pressure
and
nutrient
amendment on phosphatase activity, the patterns were
similar to the other enzymes. The addition of an invasive
nitrogen-ﬁxing plant appears to ameliorate the impact of
nutrient reduction on soil microbial function. Nitrogen
ﬁxation by an invasive plant may have altered the way
microbial communities access nutrients in low-nutrient
environments, even though this effect did not scale up to
alter potential nitrogen mineralization. Similar to our
results, Kardol et al. (2010) found that phosphatase activ-
ity was lower in soils where Lespedeza was present. We
predicted that as nitrogen became less limiting, phospho-
rus would become more limiting to microbial growth
(Demoling et al. 2007). However, when nitrogen was lim-
iting, the addition of Lespedeza increased enzymatic activ-
ity across all three enzymes tested. This leads us to infer
that nitrogen limitation in the nitrogen-reduced plots was
alleviated by the addition of Lespedeza resulting in
increased microbial enzyme activity. Similar to our plant
and bacterial abundance data, nitrogen addition had no
signiﬁcant effect on any of the enzymes we measured.
Our results indicate that propagule pressure from an
invasive nitrogen-ﬁxing plant can interact with soil nutri-
ent status and insect abundance to shape plant and soil
communities and potentially the feedbacks between the
two. After 6 years of experimental treatments, our larger-
scale measurements – plant biomass and soil nitrogen
cycling – responded directly to the main effects of our
manipulations, while the more ﬁne-scale community
measurements tended to be shaped by interactive effects
of our treatments, in particular invasive species and nutri-
ent manipulations. Plant–microbe interactions run the

gamut from positive interactions that enhance plant
growth to negative interactions that slow plant growth
(Jackson and Taylor 1996; Oldroyd and Robatzek 2011).
Factors such as changes in soil nutrient availability, inva-
sion by non-native plants, and insect abundance can
mediate the interactions between plant and soil commu-
nities – thus shifting the response of plants and their
associated soil communities through time (Ladygina and
Hedlund 2010; Fisher et al. 2013). Understanding how
above- and belowground components of ecosystems are
linked and how those linkages are mediated by invasive
plant species, insect abundance, and soil nutrient avail-
ability will be increasingly important in a changing world.
