Abstract 
Background:  The proteasome system plays an important role in synaptic plasticity. Induction and maintenance 
of long term potentiation is directly dependent on selective targeting of proteins for proteasomal degradation. The 
20S proteasome activator PA28αβ activates hydrolysis of small nonubiquitinated peptides and possesses protective 
functions upon oxidative stress and proteinopathy. The effect of PA28αβ activity on behavior and memory function 
is, however, not known. We generated a mouse model that overexpresses PA28α (PA28αOE) to understand PA28αβ 
function during healthy adult homeostasis via assessment of physiological and behavioral profiles, focusing on female 
mice.
Results:  PA28α and PA28β protein levels were markedly increased in all PA28αOE tissues analyzed. PA28αOE dis-
played reduced depressive-like behavior in the forced swim test and improved memory/learning function assessed 
by intersession habituation in activity box and shuttle box passive avoidance test, with no significant differences in 
anxiety or general locomotor activity. Nor were there any differences found when compared to WT for body composi-
tion or immuno-profile. The cognitive effects of PA28αOE were female specific, but could not be explained by altera-
tions in estrogen serum levels or hippocampal regulation of estrogen receptor β. Further, there were no differences 
in hippocampal protein expression of neuronal or synaptic markers between PA28αOE and WT. Biochemical analysis 
of hippocampal extracts demonstrated that PA28α overexpression did not increase PA28–20S peptidase activity or 
decrease K48-polyubiquitin levels. Instead, PA28αOE exhibited elevated efficiency in preventing aggregation in the 
hippocampus.
Conclusions:  This study reveals, for the first time, a connection between PA28αβ and neuronal function. We found 
that PA28α overexpressing female mice displayed reduced depressive-like behavior and enhanced learning and 
memory. Since the positive effects of PA28α overexpression arose without an activation of 20S proteasome capac-
ity, they are likely independent of PA28αβ’s role as a 20S proteasome activator and instead depend on a recognized 
chaperone-like function. These findings suggest that proteostasis in synaptic plasticity is more diverse than previously 
reported, and demonstrates a novel function of PA28αβ in the brain.

Background
The proteasome is a sophisticated multi-subunit pro-
tease comprising the 20S catalytic core and up to two 
proteasome activators that interact physically with 
20S and control substrate entry to its inner proteolytic 
compartment. PA28αβ is a proteasome activator, which 
is produced upon interferon-γ stimulation [1] and oxi-
dative stress [2]. Whilst involved in antigen process-
ing and presentation by the major histocompatibility 
complex I (MHC-I) [3, 4], PA28αβ provides protective 
functions upon oxidative stress and proteinopathy as 
demonstrated in both animal and cell model studies 
[5–9].
Protective effects of PA28αβ have been found in mice, 
where an overexpression of PA28α specifically in car-
diomyocytes lowered the myocardial infarct size upon 
ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) and preserved ventricular 
contractility after reperfusion [5]. Cardiomyocyte-spe-
cific overexpression of PA28α also prolonged lifespan of 
a desmin-related cardiomyopathy mouse model while 
reducing its associated proteinopathy [5]. Cultured rat 
cardiomyocytes overexpressing PA28α exhibit reduced 
apoptosis and protein oxidation upon hydrogen perox-
ide ­(H2O2) exposure [6]. Immortalized mouse embry-
onic fibroblasts (MEFs) exposed to a mild pre-treatment 
of ­H2O2 become less sensitive to a harsh ­H2O2 expo-
sure compared to untreated cells. This ­H2O2 adaptation 
requires induction of PA28α [7, 8]. Furthermore, PA28α 
is essential for protein damage control during mouse ES 
cell differentiation [9].
The mechanism behind PA28αβ’s protective effects is 
not known. In vitro studies using purified proteins have 
shown that PA28αβ can induce degradation of an oxi-
dized protein substrate [7] and exhibit chaperone-like 
functions in collaboration with Hsp40, Hsp70 and Hsp90 
[10].
It is well established that the proteasome system is 
important for the nervous system to function properly. 
Proteasome-dependent protein degradation is known 
to be critical for long-term potentiation (LTP) [11–16], 
a molecular mechanism central for learning and mem-
ory. Proteasome inhibition impairs murine memory and 
learning analyzed by one-trail inhibitory avoidance [15], 
taste aversion [16], auditory fear conditioning and con-
text fear conditioning [17]. In addition, the proteasome 
system regulates synaptic transmission at both presyn-
aptic and postsynaptic terminals in mammalian neurons 
[18–20]. However, the role of PA28αβ in neuronal func-
tion is an almost completely unexplored field. Protein 
expression patterns in the brain of healthy and disease 
subjects [21–24] suggest a role in neurodegenerative dis-
ease and traumatic brain injury, but no mechanistic stud-
ies have been performed.
We have generated a mouse model in which the gene 
encoding murine PA28α is overexpressed in all analyzed 
tissues (PA28αOE). The aim of this study is to character-
ize the behavior and physiology of female healthy adult 
mice to gain insight into the role of PA28αβ in normal 
physiological and cognitive functions.
Results
Generation and evaluation of the PA28αOE model
A targeting vector for PA28α overexpression (PA28αOE), 
which included the CAG​ promoter driving the expression 
of the coding region of murine PA28α, was targeted to 
the murine Rosa26 locus (see Fig. 1a). Correct integration 
in murine embryonic stem (ES) cells and murine spleno-
cytes was confirmed by Targeted Locus Amplification 
(Cergentis).
Western blot analysis of male PA28αOE C57BL/6 mice 
(n = 3) confirmed that PA28α was overexpressed in het-
erozygous PA28αOE eye lens (P = 0.0049), left ventricle 
of the heart (P < 1E−6), mouse embryonic fibroblasts 
(MEFs; P < 1E−5) as well as in a mixed sample of fron-
tal cortex and striatum of the brain (P < 0.001; Fig.  1b 
and Additional file 1). PA28α overexpression resulted in 
an upregulation of PA28β (the other PA28αβ subunit) 
in MEFs, frontal cortex and striatum from PA28αOE 
(detected in OE MEFs but below detection level in WT; 
Fig. 1b and Additional file 1), while PA28β mRNA levels 
were not affected (Fig. 1c and Additional file 1). This is 
in line with the previous finding in cardiomyocytes that 
PA28α overexpression stabilizes PA28β at the protein 
level [6]. Hence, all components of the PA28αβ complex 
are present in the tissues analyzed from the PA28αOE 
mouse model.
Female C57BL/6N × BALB/c F2 hybrid mice
Crosses between two inbred strains, hybrids, tend 
to be more genetically vigorous and less sensitive to 
adverse environmental conditions than inbred strains. 
To take advantage of these characteristics we generated 
C57BL/6N × BALB/c F2 hybrids for phenotypic profil-
ing of the PA28αOE mouse model. We chose to analyze 
the mice at the age of 7–8 months, approximately corre-
sponding to a human age of 32–34 years [25], to ensure 
focus on adult homeostasis. 10 wildtype (WT) and 6 
PA28αOE heterozygous female F2 hybrid littermates 
were subjected to physiological and behavioral pheno-
typic profiling as outlined in Fig. 2a.
PA28αOE mice displayed no differences in body 
composition or immunological profile
PA28αOE mice appeared healthy and energetic, and 
were visually indistinguishable from WT with respect 
to appearance and behavior. There were no statistically

PA28αOE mice show decreased depressive‑like behavior 
and increased learning
In the behavioral examinations, PA28αOE mice displayed 
a 400% increase in mean active time in the forced swim 
test (FST, Fig. 2b and Additional file 5; P = 0.047), indicat-
ing a reduction in depressive-like behavior compared to 
WT. This was not explained by a change between groups 
in terms of general anxiety or physical activity, as there 
were neither differences in anxiety levels, measured in 
the elevated zeromaze (Fig.  2c and Additional file  5), 
nor general physical activity as determined by activity 
box measurements (Locomotion, Fig. 3a and Additional 
file 6).
To determine if the decreased depressive like behavior 
displayed by the PA28αOE mice resulted in improved 
cognitive functions, we compared the time the animals 
spent in corners and the number of rearings (standing 
on hind legs, an indication of vigilance) during the first 
day of the activity box experiment (new environment) to 
the second day of trail (acquainted environment). On day 
2, PA28αOE spent significantly more time in the corner 
(Fig. 3a and Additional file 6; P = 0.034) and exhibited a 
strong inclination to reduced rearing (P = 0.065), indi-
cating enhanced intersessional habituation of PA28αOE 
compared to WT [26, 27]. A difference in learning capac-
ity was apparent when the animals were exposed to the 
shuttle box passive avoidance test, all PA28αOE mice 
(6/6) stayed out of the dark compartment on day 2, 
where they experienced a mild electric shock the previ-
ous day, while only 2 out of 10 WT did the same (Fig. 3b 
and Additional file 6; P = 0.0056). This behavior did not 
result from a change in pain tolerance between WT and 
PA28αOE, determined by direct response in the shut-
tle box assay (see Methods section) and by the tail-flick 
method (Additional file  7). Taken together, PA28αOE 
mice display decreased depressive-like behavior and an 
increased capacity for learning compared to their WT 
littermates.
The cognitive effects of PA28αOE are female specific
As the previous experiments were performed with female 
mice, we wanted to determine whether these behavioral 
effects of PA28αOE were gender specific. To this end, 
we subjected male C57BL/6N × BALB/c F2 hybrids (lit-
ter mates to the females analyzed) to the same cognitive 
behavioral tests. Male PA28αOE mice did not, however, 
display an increase in activity compared to WT when 
subjected to the forced swim test (n ≥ 5; Additional 
file  8). Neither did they show any significant changes 
in learning compared to WT in the shuttle box passive 
avoidance, nor were there any indications of enhanced 
habituation in the male PA28αOE mice compared to WT 
in activity box measurements (n ≥ 5; Additional file  8). 
Thus, we could not find any effect of PA28α overexpres-
sion in male mice on cognitive behavior in our behavioral 
tests suggesting that the effects of PA28αOE overexpres-
sion are female specific.
PA28αOE mice display no change in serum estrogen 
or hippocampal estrogen receptor regulation
As the declarative component of passive avoidance 
memory formation is formed in the hippocampus and 
fluctuating levels of estrogen directly affect hippocam-
pal memory function [28], differences in estrogen levels 
between animal groups could explain the results obtained 
in our behavioral assays. To determine if this was the 
case, blood serum levels of estrogen was determined by 
ELISA, showing no differences in estrogen levels between 
PA28αOE and WT (Additional file 9), nor in the levels 
of S105-phosphorylated estrogen receptor β from hip-
pocampal extracts (Additional file 9). This suggests that 
the resulting differences in behavior are neither a result 
of differences in serum levels of estrogen nor hippocam-
pal regulation of estrogen receptor β.
PA28αOE mice exhibit no differences in hippocampal 
protein expression of neuronal or synaptic markers
As proteasome-dependent protein degradation is crucial 
for long-term potentiation (LTP) [11–16] we investigated 
if there were global changes in the amount of AMPA 
receptors and/or synaptic markers in the PA28αOE mice 
that could explain their increased learning capacity. Iso-
lation of hippocampus (9 WT and 6 PA28αOE female F2 
hybrids) and subsequent WB analysis revealed no dif-
ferences in neuronal density of neurons, measured by

repeated measurements, followed by Sidak test, F(1, 14) = 5498), and exhibited a strong tendency of reduced rearing [P = 0.065; F(1, 14) = 3992], 
both of which are indicators of more proficient habituation. Locomotion on day 2 between PA28αOE and WT is not statistically different (P = 0.19).

As shown, on day 2 there is a significant difference between PA28αOE and WT in re-entering the compartment (Pday2= 0.0056). Maximum assay 
time was 300 s (i.e. no entry = 300 s). Dashed lines correspond to 95% confidence interval

expression of the neuronal nuclear marker NeuN (Addi-
tional file  9) or synaptic density, measured as expres-
sion of adhesion molecule N-Cadherin, together with 
the presynaptic vesicle glycoprotein Synaptophysin 
and the excitatory postsynaptic density protein PSD-95 
(Additional file 9). The AMPA receptor subunits GluA1 
and GluA2 did not differ in expression between animal 
groups, nor the expression of Spinophilin, a postsynaptic 
density protein involved in spine formation (Additional 
file 9). However, expression of GluA2, Synaptophysin and 
GluA1 varied greatly but correlated to each other and 
to the level of S105-phosphorylated estrogen receptor β 
(Additional file 9; correlation coefficients: ­CCGluA2-Synphys: 
0.93; 
­CCGluA2-GluA1 = 0.92; 
­CCGluA2-S105-ERβ = 0.72; 
­CCSynphys-GluA1 = 0.83; 
­CCSynphys-S105-ERβ = 0.61; 
­CCGluA1-S105-ERβ = 0.84).
LTP in the hippocampus is dependent on activation 
of calcium calmodulin kinase II [29] and is positively 
modulated by cAMP response element-binding protein 
[30] suggesting that increased activation of these could 
correlate to enhanced learning. We could, however, find 
no differences in phosphorylated CaMKII or phospho-
rylated CREB between PA28αOE and WT hippocampi 
(Additional file 9).
Hence, global expression levels of neuronal, synaptic 
or LTP markers cannot explain the cognitive differences 
observed between WT and PA28αOE female mice.
PA28αOE mice do not demonstrate induced proteasome 
activity
The prevailing view of PA28αβ´s molecular function 
in the cell is activation of the 20S proteasome. We per-
formed proteasome activity assays on hippocampal 
extracts from WT and PA28αOE female mice to investi-
gate whether the cognitive effects observed upon PA28α 
overexpression are associated with such activation. The 
interactions between the 20S proteasome and its different 
regulators are perturbed or compromised by mutually 
exclusive extraction conditions [31–33]. Thus, to detect 
PA28-dependent activation of 20S proteasome capacity 
(digestion of fluorogenic peptides in  vitro), conditions 
specifically optimizing the interaction between 20S and 
PA28αβ need to be used [e.g. no salt; 31, 32].
We detected a threefold increase in PA28-dependent 
proteasome capacity upon IFN-γ treatment after using 
conditions optimizing PA28–20S interaction (MEFs, 
positive control, Fig.  4a and Additional file  10). How-
ever, in PA28αOE hippocampi there was no induction in 
PA28-dependent proteasome capacity compared to WT 
hippocampi (Fig. 4a and Additional file 10; n ≥ 3, animals 
used in the phenotypic profiling). This was unexpected 
since PA28α is capable of self-assembly in  vitro into a 
heptamer ring [34, 35], which can activate 20S proteas-
ome capacity [36]. To further analyze this, PA28-depend-
ent proteasome capacities of PA28αOE and WT MEFs 
were determined, also demonstrating a lack of induction 
in PA28αOE (Additional file 11, 12).
Western analysis of hippocampal K48-linked polyubiq-
uitinated proteins, generally targeted for proteasomal 
degradation, showed a clear trend of increased levels in 
PA28αOE (Fig. 4b and Additional file 13; P = 0.051), indi-
cating reduced 26S proteasome activity and in line with 
PA28α overexpression being unable to activate protea-
some activity. 20S proteasome capacity was not induced 
in PA28αOE hippocampi (Fig. 4c and Additional file 10) 
and hippocampal levels of proteasome related markers 
Rpt2 (19S subunit), β5 (20S) and β5i (20Si) did not dif-
fer between WT and PA28αOE (Fig. 4d and Additional 
file  13), while PA28α overexpression in PA28αOE hip-
pocampi was verified (Fig. 4d).
For these reasons, we conclude that the improved cog-
nitive functions observed upon PA28α overexpression 
arise without an increase in 20S proteasome activity, 
(See figure on next page.)

and are therefore likely not dependent on this molecular 
function of PA28αβ.
PA28αOE hippocampus extracts prevent aggregation more 
efficiently than WT
PA28αβ has a recognized chaperone-like activity not nec-
essarily coupled to its role as a 20S proteasome activator 
[10, 37]. Therefore, WT and PA28αOE female hippocam-
pal extracts were analyzed to determine their capacity 
to prevent aggregation of heat sensitive luciferase. Hip-
pocampal extracts from PA28αOE were more efficient in 
preventing aggregation than WT hippocampal extracts 
(Fig.  4e and Additional file  13; P = 0.036). Thus, as 
depicted in Fig. 4f, chaperone-like functions of PA28αβ, 
rather than its role as a proteasome activator, are likely 
part of the mechanism behind the observed cognitive 
effects in PA28αOE.
Discussion
This study couples, for the first time, PA28αβ to neuronal 
function and demonstrates that PA28α overexpression 
reduces depressive-like behavior and enhances learning/
memory in female mice without inducing 20S protea-
some activity. Instead, our data suggest that the observed 
effects on cognitive capacity is exerted by PA28αβ chap-
erone-like functions.
The forced swim test is an established behavioral model 
to assess emotional state of rodents [38]. The increased 
activity time of PA28αOE mice compared to WT could 
point to an antidepressant action of overexpressing 
PA28α, though a direct effect of PA28α on enhancing 
locomotion activity could not be ruled out. We found no 
difference, however, between WT and PA28αOE mice in 
general locomotor activity, assessed in the activity box, 
supporting that the effect observed in the forced swim 
test is a stress coping mechanism of PA28αOE mice.
Open-field tests are traditionally known to assess emo-
tionality and anxiety-like behavior and are also acknowl-
edged to assay locomotion and exploratory behavior 
[39–41]. In a new environment, the innate behavior of 
mice is to explore, specifically the periphery, and avoid 
the open areas of the box. Habituation is considered the 
simplest form of learning and memory [26] and can be 
measured intrasessionally (within-session) which is pro-
posed to primarily reflect adaptation [42] or intersession-
ally (between sessions) by repeated exposures, reflecting 
learning and memory [27].
We found no differences in the behavior between 
PA28αOE and WT during day 1 in the activity box. This 
indicates that there is no difference between WT and 
PA28αOE mice in general locomotor activity, adapta-
tion (intrasessional habituation) or anxiety-like behav-
ior; the latter confirmed by zeromaze anxiety analysis. 
However, on day 2, PA28αOE mice changed their behav-
ior and spent more time in the corner and tended to 
reduce their number of rearings. Increased corner time 
and reduced rearing are both indicators of anti-explora-
tory behavior signifying that PA28αOE mice habituate 
faster. The increased capacity for learning was further 
confirmed in the shuttle box passive avoidance test. On 
day 2, no PA28αOE female mice entered the avoidance-
trained area in the shuttle box, in stark contrast to WT 
littermates. Thus, results from both activity box analysis 
and shuttle box passive avoidance test demonstrate an 
increased learning capacity of PA28αOE female mice.
Remarkably, none of the cognitive behavioral effects 
from PA28α overexpression were observed in male lit-
termates, indicating that these effects are female spe-
cific. Results in the forced-swim test have been shown to 
be dependent on several factors, such as age of animals, 
strain and gender [38, 43]. A possible explanation for our 
results could be an innate difference between male and 
female mice in depressive-like behavior that is reversed 
by PA28α overexpression, which in females unleashes 
positive effects on cognitive functions. Comparing male 
and female performance in the forced swim test shows a 
trend for a higher baseline activity in males, though not 
statistically significant. As depressive-like behavior and 
function of the hippocampus are closely linked [44], the 
increased capacity for learning could point to a direct 
effect of PA28αβ in the hippocampus. Upon examina-
tion, we found no alterations in serum estrogen levels or 
hippocampal regulation of estrogen receptor β that could 
shed light on the mechanism behind the sex difference. 
Further, no key neuronal or synaptic markers differed in 
expression between PA28αOE and WT hippocampi.
Proteasome-dependent protein degradation is well 
known to play central roles in long term potentiation, 
regulation of synaptic transmission, and synaptic plas-
ticity. However, this study presents data strongly indi-
cating that the effects of PA28α overexpression on 
memory/learning are not dependent on PA28αβ as a 
proteasome activator. Analysis of hippocampi from WT 
and PA28αOE littermates revealed that PA28α overex-
pression did not increase PA28-dependent 20S peptidase 
activity or decrease K48-linked polyubiquitin levels. It is 
important to note that, even though data presented here 
demonstrates that proteolysis is not generally enhanced 
in PA28αOE, a change in individual peptides/proteins, 
although unlikely, cannot be excluded. In addition, 
an increase in neuronal proteasome activity has been 
observed in response to learning [15, 45] and it is possi-
ble that enhanced PA28αβ expression specifically modu-
lates this complex neuronal activation state in a manner 
leading to improved memory, while baseline proteasome 
activity is unaltered.

Previous studies overexpressing PA28α have dem-
onstrated a minor increase in proteasome activity [6, 
46]. However, none of those experiments included a 
positive control (interferon-γ treated cells or purified 
20S ± PA28αβ) and were either not conducted under 
PA28–20S optimizing conditions [6] or not negatively 
controlled [specific 20S proteasome inhibitor; 46]. In the 
in vivo study of cardiomyocyte PA28α overexpression [5], 
enhanced proteasome function was verified by expres-
sion of the reporter gene GFPdgn (GFP fused to degron 
CL1) [5, 47]. Degradation of GFPdgn is however not only 
dependent on the proteasome itself, but is also a reflec-
tion of the efficiency in recognition and unfolding of this 
particular substrate. The reduction in GFPdgn observed 
upon PA28α overexpression may thus instead be a result 
of PA28αβ chaperone functions.
As opposed to proteasome activation, our data sug-
gest that the observed effects on cognition is exerted by 
PA28αβ chaperone-like functions, since hippocampal 
extracts from PA28αOE prevented protein aggregation 
more efficiently than hippocampal extracts from WT. 
PA28αβ has previously been shown to be able to collabo-
rate with Hsp40, Hsp70 and Hsp90 to refold a denatured 
protein substrate [10]. In addition, PA28αβ can com-
pensate for Hsp90 functions in major histocompatibility 
complex class I antigen processing [37].
As a chaperone, PA28αβ may play a direct role in neu-
ron protein homeostasis and metabolism, affecting firing, 
signaling, action potential generation as well as vesicular 
transport and release. Improved learning in PA28αOE 
mice could be due to an elevated  capacity for  cellu-
lar memory formation, i.e. an enhanced  probability for 
inducing LTP or an increase in the actual magnitude 
of LTP. Induction and expression of LTP is ultimately 
expressed as number of AMPA-receptors in the synapse 
[48] but whole-hippocampi analysis of GluA1 and A2 did 
not reveal any differences between WT and PA28αOE. A 
chaperone-like activity could be an explanation for this, 
as PA28αβ could exert its effect by increasing AMPA-
receptor stability, rather than number, thus increasing 
availability of AMPA-receptors in the membrane and 
subsequently the likelihood of AMPA-recruitment to the 
synapse.
In addition, or alternatively, to a direct role in neuron 
function, PA28αβ chaperone-like activity could be part 
of the mechanism behind its protective effects against 
oxidative stress and proteinopathy, and thus the positive 
effects on cognitive capacity by PA28α overexpression 
could be a result of neuroprotection. Oxidative stress 
and proteinopathy are central for the progression and/
or detrimental effects of many diseases that cause decline 
in cognitive functions, including neurodegenerative dis-
eases and neuronal injury after stroke and head trauma 
[49, 50]. Hence, PA28α overexpression may increase the 
fitness and exert effects protecting against these diseases, 
perhaps acting at the core of early aging events.
Conclusions
In this study, we demonstrate that overexpression of 
PA28α and concomitant upregulation of PA28β protein 
reduces depressive-like behavior and enhances learn-
ing and memory in female mice. The overexpression of 
PA28α does not increase PA28αβ-dependent proteasome 
activity but could still be linked to its protective functions 
upon oxidative stress and proteinopathy. The underly-
ing mechanism to these protective effects may instead 
involve chaperone-like functions of PA28αβ.
Methods
Animal care, diets and termination
C57BL/6N (Charles River, Lyon, France), BALB/c 
(Harlan Laboratories, Horst, the Netherlands) and 
C57BL/6N × BALB/c F2  hybrid mice were housed in 
a temperature controlled room (21  °C) with a 12:12 h 
light–dark cycle (dawn: 5.30–6.00 am, dusk: 5.30–6 pm) 
and controlled humidity (45–55%). They were checked 
daily had free access to water and regular chow diet (R3; 
Lactamin, Kimstad Sweden) containing 12% fat, 62% car-
bohydrates, and 26% protein (energy percentage), with 
a total energy content of 3 kcal/g. At termination, mice 
were euthanized under 5% isoflurane anesthesia and 
decapitated. Blood samples for hematology were col-
lected by intra-cardiac puncture, tissues were isolated, 
directly transferred to dry ice, and kept at − 80 °C until 
biochemical analyses.
Generation of PA28αOE mice
A knock-in strategy was used to target the murine 
Rosa26 locus in order to generate mice carrying a murine 
PA28α overexpression cassette at this site. The target-
ing vector was built using homologous recombination in 
bacteria [51] and a C57 mouse BAC served as template 
for the extraction of Rosa26 homology arms. The target-
ing vector contained the CAG​ promoter [52] driving the 
expression of the coding region of murine PA28α and a 
rabbit β-globin poly (A) signal (CAG-PA28α-pA) and a 
neomycin phosphotransferase (Neo) selectable marker 
cassette. The PGK-gb2-neo cassette with CAG-PA28α-pA 
was inserted into a Rosa26 targeting vector comprised of 
a 1.5 kb 5′ and 5 kb 3′ homology arms of Rosa26, and a 
PGK-diphtheria toxin A (DTA) gene for negative selec-
tion (Fig. 1a). The Neo selectable marker cassette, which 
was flanked by loxp sites, was deleted in the germline of 
the chimeric mice generating the KI allele using a self-
excising Neo strategy. After linearization, the targeting 
Page 11 of 15
Adelöf et al. BMC Neurosci           (2018) 19:70 
construct was electroporated into C57BL/6N mouse 
embryonic stem (ES) cells which were then grown in 
media containing G418 (200 μg/ml). Thus, the PA28αOE 
mouse line was established on a pure C57BL/6 genetic 
background. PCR screens and Targeted Locus Ampli-
fication (Cergentis, Utrecht, the Netherlands) analyses 
revealed clones that had undergone the desired homolo-
gous recombination event. Several of these clones were 
expanded and injected into Balb/cOlaHsd blastocysts 
to generate chimeric males which were then bred to 
C57BL/6JOlaHsd females and black-coated offspring 
were genotyped on both sides of the homology arms for 
correct integration into the Rosa26 locus.
SDS–PAGE and Western blot analysis
MEFs, brain sample containing frontal cortex and stria-
tum, left ventricle of the heart, and hippocampi were 
lysed with a modified RIPA buffer (50 mM ­Na2HPO4 pH 
7.8; 150 mM NaCl; 1% Nonidet P-40; 0.5% deoxycholate; 
0.1% SDS; 1  mM DTPA; 1  mM pefablock). Cell debris 
was removed by centrifugation at 5000 g for 10 min and 
protein concentration was determined using the Pierce™ 
BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Eye 
lenses were lysed by sonication (Branson Ultrasonic 
Corp., Danbury, CT, USA) in PBS [53]. Samples were 
prepared for SDS–PAGE as described [54], separated 
by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis (PAGE), transferred onto a nitrocellu-
lose membrane (Invitrogen, Bleiswjik, the Netherlands) 
and probed with rabbit mAb PA28α (#9643; Cell Signal-
ing Technology, Inc., Leiden, the Netherlands), rabbit 
pAb PA28β (#2409), rabbit mAb GluA2 (#13607), rabbit 
pAb N-Cadherin (#4061), rabbit pAb GluA1 (#13185), 
rabbit pAb β5/PSMB5 (#11903), rabbit mAb Phospho-
CaMKII Thr286 (#12716), rabbit mAb Phospho-CREB 
Ser133 (#9198), rabbit pAb polyubiquitin K48-linkage 
specific (ab190061; Abcam, Cambridge UK), goat pAb 
PSD-95 (ab12093), rabbit pAb GluA1 (ab31232), rabbit 
mAb Synaptophysin (ab32127), rabbit pAb Spinophilin 
(ab203275), rabbit mAb NeuN (ab177487), rabbit pAb 
Estrogen Receptor beta phospho S105 (ab62257), rabbit 
pAb Rpt2/S4 (ab3317), or rabbit pAb β5i/LMP7 (ab3329). 
IRDye 800CW-labelled goat anti-rabbit, 680CW-labelled 
goat anti-mouse, 800CW-labelled donkey anti-goat 
IgG antibodies (LI-COR Biosciences, Cambridge, UK) 
were used for detection and blots were analyzed with 
the Odyssey infrared imaging system and software (LI-
COR Biosciences), except for lens samples for which 
HRP-conjugated secondary Ab was used and lumines-
cence after ECL reaction was imaged using ImageQuant 
LAS 500 (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Blots 
were quantified using the ImageJ software. Equal total 
protein present of each sample on the membrane was 
confirmed using the Novex reversible membrane protein 
stain (IB7710, Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s 
instructions.
RNA extraction and quantitative (qPCR) analysis
Total RNA was extracted using Stat60 (CS-502, Tel-Test 
Inc) as per manufacturer’s recommendations. cDNA was 
synthesized on 1 µg total RNA using the High-Capacity 
cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (#4368814 Applied Bio-
systems, Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufac-
turer’s instructions. Synthesized cDNA was analyzed in 
triplicates by qPCR using iQTM SYBRH Green Supermix 
and the QuantStudio 7 Flex system (Applied Biosystems, 
Thermo Fisher Scientific). For primer sequences, see 
Additional file 14.
Study design of physiological and behavioral phenotypic 
profiling
10 Wildtype (WT) and 6 PA28αOE heterozygous female 
F2 hybrid littermates at the age of 6 months were sub-
jected to a 2-month protocol of physiological and behav-
ioral phenotypic profiling as outlined in Fig.  2a. The 
mice were housed 4 in each cage with 2 WT-cages, 1 
PA28αOE-cage, and 1 mixed cage. The genotype was not 
indicated on the cage, and the animal number to geno-
type was not decoded until after data analysis. The ani-
mals were analyzed cage by cage in the following order: 
WT-cage 1, PA28αOE-cage, WT-cage 2, mixed cage. 
Shuttle box and zeromaze were performed in 3 rounds 
with 6 mice each round as follows: (1) 4 WT from 
WT-cage 1 and 2 PA28αOE from PA28αOE-cage, (2) 
2 PA28αOE from PA28αOE-cage and 2 WT from WT-
cage 2, (3) 2 WT from WT-cage 2 and 2 PA28αOE and 
2 WT from mixed cage. Activity box was performed in 2 
rounds with 8 mice each round as follows: (1) 4 WT from 
WT-cage 1 and 4 PA28αOE from PA28αOE-cage, (2) 4 
WT from WT-cage 2 and 2 WT from WT-cage 2 and 2 
PA28αOE and 2 WT from mixed cage. All animal experi-
ments were carried out at 10–11 am, except activity box 
that was carried out at 10–12 am.
Activity box
Activity box is an open field activity-like test to study 
general activity, exploratory behavior, signs of anxi-
ety, stress and depression [55]. The mice are three 
dimensionally recorded by infrared sensors built into 
the walls (8Lx8Bx8H) of a sound-proof opaque box 
(50 × 50 × 50 cm) with a low intensity lamp into the lid 
of the box (Kungsbacka mät och regler, Fjärrås, Swe-
den). The mice were placed in the middle of the box 
and recorded for 1 h in this novel environment. On the 
Page 12 of 15
Adelöf et al. BMC Neurosci           (2018) 19:70 
following day, they were recorded again in the—now 
considered—acquainted 
environment. 
The 
param-
eters recorded as events/5 min were horizontal activity, 
peripheral activity, rearing activity, peripheral rearing, 
rearing time, locomotion, and corner time.
Forced swim test
This test is performed to analyze mice for signs of depres-
sion [55, 56]. The assembly consists of a transparent plex-
iglas cylinder with 25 cm inner diameter and 60 cm in 
length with a grey, circular plastic platform hanging from 
wires on the outside of the cylinder, approximately 20 cm 
from the top (bespoke construction, AstraZeneca Goth-
enburg), and filled with room tempered (22 °C) water in 
level with the platform. A single mouse is placed on the 
water surface inside the cylinder and its behavior is mon-
itored by a video camera placed directly above the cylin-
der for 6 min and 20 s, of which the last 4 min are used in 
calculation (MouseTracker analysis software).
Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)
Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) baseline measure-
ments were obtained after 5 h of fasting, followed by oral 
glucose dosing (6.7 ml/kg). Insulin levels was measured 
with Ultra-sensitive mouse insulin ELISA kit (Crystal 
Chem, Zaandam, Netherlands) according to manufactur-
er’s instructions and glucose levels by AccuChek mobile 
blood glucose meter (Roche Diagnostics Scandinavia, 
Solna, Sweden) at baseline and after 15, 30, 60, 120 min 
from dosing.
Shuttle box passive avoidance test
Passive avoidance testing was performed using the shut-
tle box system (Accuscan Instruments Inc., Columbus, 
OH, USA). This test is used to study memory perfor-
mance in mice and is carried out over 2 days [55, 57, 58]. 
The system consists of a cage centrally divided by a wall 
into two compartments, one of which has transparent 
walls (the bright compartment) while the other is cov-
ered from all sides with opaque walls (the dark compart-
ment). Both chambers are equipped with sensors that 
determine the location of the mouse and the central wall 
has a mechanical sliding door that can be programmed 
to open or close. The cage floor is made of stainless steel 
grid, which can deliver a mild electric shock to the mouse 
upon certain stimuli. On the first day, a mouse is released 
into the well-lit compartment and tends to migrate to 
the dark compartment when the central door opens (30 s 
after mouse entry). Upon entry to the dark compartment, 
the central door closes and the mouse is exposed to a 
mild electric shock (0.3 mA). Intensity of pain response 
was monitored. All mice responded to the electric shock 
by a vocal response (“beep”) and a jump, indicating simi-
lar strength of discomfort. On the second day, the mouse 
is released as before into the well-lit compartment and 
when the central door opens, may or may not enter the 
dark compartment. The time taken to enter the dark 
compartment is recorded on both days and a longer 
interval or no entry on the second day indicates memory 
response. Maximum assay time is 300 s each day.
Elevated zeromaze monitoring system
The   elevated zeromaze system (Accuscan Instruments 
Inc.) was used to study anxiety-related behavior [55, 59, 
60]. The maze is made up of a circular Perspex platform, 
elevated 75  cm above the floor, 5  cm wide and 40  cm 
inner diameter, equally divided into four quadrants, of 
which two quadrants on opposite sides of the platform 
are closed by 30 cm high Perspex transparent walls with 
photocell transceivers, while the other two quadrants 
are open and bordered by a Perspex lip (0.5 cm high), a 
security and tactile guide on the open quadrants. Dur-
ing testing, a mouse is placed at the entrance of a closed 
quadrant and monitored for 5  min. Activity in closed 
arm, latency to enter open arm, and time spent in open 
and closed arm are the parameters analyzed.
Body composition and core temperature
Core body temperature of the mice was obtained with 
a rectal probe thermometer (ELFA AB, Sweden). Under 
2% isoflurane sedation the mice were analyzed by dual 
energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) using Lunar PIXI-
mus Densitometer (GE Medical Systems, Madison, WI, 
USA) to determine body fat (g), body fat (%), lean body 
mass (g), and total BMD (g/cm2) [55].
Immunoprofiling of peripheral blood
Blood samples for hematology (in EDTA tubes, Micro-
vette CB300, Sarstedt, Nürnbrecht, Germany) were col-
lected from the left atrium of the heart under isoflurane 
anesthesia, prior to necropsy. Leucocytes and erythro-
cytes were isolated by centrifugation and stained with 
1:50 dilutions of MS CD45 HRZN V500 mAb (#561487; 
BD Diagnostics, Stockholm, Sweden), MS F4/80 PE 
T45-2342 (#565410), MS CD4 PERCP mAb (#561090), 
MS CD19 APC mAb (#561738), CD8 APC-Cy7 mAb 
(#561967), NK1.1 FITC mAb (#553164), and CD3e con-
jugated to BD Horizon V450 (#560804). Erythrocytes 
were lysed with BD FACS lysis buffer and analyzed using 
flow cytometry (FACS Fortessa, BD Bioscience, Stock-
holm, Sweden) with appropriate filter settings, gating on 
live cells.

Blood serum preparation and β‑estradiol detection
Blood samples for blood serum preparation were col-
lected from the left atrium of the heart under isoflurane 
anesthesia, prior to necropsy, incubated at room tem-
perature for 30–45  min, and coagulates were removed 
by centrifugation. Relative β-estradiol serum levels were 
detected by the Mouse/Rat Estradiol ELISA-Kit (SKU: 
ES180S-100, Calbiotech, Spring Valley, CA USA) accord-
ing to manufacturer’s instructions.
Cell culture and IFN‑γ treatment of embryonic fibroblasts
MEFs from C57BL/6N females that had been mated with 
C57BL/6N PA28αOE heterozygote males, were isolated 
at E13.5 as described [61], with the following exceptions: 
embryos were isolated individually, heads were used for 
genotyping and the trypsin treatment was for 45 min in 
0.05% trypsin–EDTA solution with 1% chicken serum 
(Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Gothenburg, Sweden) 
under gentle agitation. Cells were cultivated in DMEM 
(Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum 
(FBS), 1% Penicillin/streptomycin and 1% non-essential 
amino acids at 37 °C under 5% CO2 and ambient oxygen. 
For positive control in the analysis of PA28αβ-dependent 
proteasome capacity, 150 U/mL recombinant mouse 
IFN-γ (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to the cul-
ture media 24 h prior harvest.
Proteasome capacity assays
PA28–20S or 20S proteasome capacity was analyzed 
as previously described [32] with some modifications. 
Cells were lysed in 25 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.3) by 4 cycles 
of high-speed centrifugation (20,000  g) and resuspen-
sion at 4 °C, cell debris was removed by centrifugation 
at 5000  g for 10  min and protein concentration was 
determined using the BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce, 
Thermo Fisher Scientific). The chemotryptic activity 
was assayed by hydrolysis of the fluorogenic peptide 
succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin 
(suc-LLVY-AMC; Calbiochem Merck-Millipore, Darm-
stadt, Germany). 10  µg total protein was incubated 
with 200 µM suc-LLVY-AMC in 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 
8.3) and 0.5 mM DTT for PA28–20S activity or 50 mM 
Tris/HCl (pH 8.3), 0.5 mM DTT and 0.02% SDS for 20S 
activity in a total volume of 100 µL; fluorescence was 
monitored using 390 nm excitation and 460 nm emis-
sion filters with free AMC as standard (Molekula Ltd., 
Gillingham, UK) and activity was determined as the 
slope of fluorescence over time divided by total protein. 
Protein levels in the assay were determined by SDS–
PAGE, InstantBlueTM (Expedeon Ltd., Cambridge 
UK) staining, and analysis using the Odyssey infrared 
imaging system and software (LI-COR Biosciences). 
Activity upon proteasome inhibition with 5 µM epox-
omicin (Sigma-Aldrich, Stockholm, Sweden) is con-
sidered non-specific/background activity. Epoxomicin 
inhibited the PA28–20S proteasome capacity to 70 ± 9% 
(mean ± SD) of WT, 77 ± 10% of PA28αOE, 98.3% of 
untreated MEFs and 99.8% of interferon-γ treated 
MEFs; and epoxomicin inhibited the 20S proteasome 
capacity to 94 ± 3% of WT, 95 ± 3% of PA28αOE, 85% of 
untreated MEFs and 81% of interferon-γ treated MEFs.
Luciferase aggregation prevention
Luciferase aggregation prevention capacity was ana-
lyzed as previously described [62] with some modifi-
cations. To increase the number of n in the analysis, 
hippocampi from females of similar age (5–6  months) 
of the C57BL/6N background, 6 WT and 6 PA28αOE, 
were included to the 4 WT and 3 PA28αOE hippocampi 
from the C57BL/6N × BALB/c F2 hybrids. Right hip-
pocampi were lysed in extraction buffer (25  mM Tris/
HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM ­MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, and 5% 
glycerol, pH 7.4) by 4 cycles of high-speed centrifuga-
tion (20,000  g) and resuspension at 4  °C. Cell debris 
was removed by centrifugation at 5000 g for 10 min and 
1 mM DTT was added after an aliquot was set aside for 
protein concentration determination with the BCA Pro-
tein Assay kit (Pierce, Thermo Fisher). Heat-sensitive 
luciferase (200  nM; L9506; Sigma-Aldrich) was heat-
denatured at 42 °C in 50 mM Tris pH 7.6, 2 mM EDTA, 
in the presence of 4.5 µg protein extracts or correspond-
ing volume of extraction buffer. Aggregation of luciferase 
was determined as light scattering at 340  nm at 42  °C. 
At around 80% of maximum, the increase in turbidity of 
the positive control (without protein extract) started to 
plateau, and the closest time point was chosen for anal-
ysis (40 min in the experiments on hybrid hippocampal 
extracts and 20  min at 42  °C in the experiments with 
C57). The turbidity of the positive control was considered 
maximum aggregation (100%). Turbidity of the negative 
control with no addition of heat-sensitive luciferase did 
not change over time and was considered background. 
Luciferase aggregation prevention capacity was calcu-
lated as percentage of non-aggregated luciferase. Extracts 
that had been incubated at 99  °C for 45  min served as 
negative control to the cell extract and did not prevent 
aggregation.
Statistical analysis
Comparisons between two groups were performed 
with unpaired t test assuming two-tailed distribution 
and equal variances and differences were considered

significant at P < 0.05. Statistical analysis of the activ-
ity box corner time day 2 (Fig. 3a) by two-way ANOVA 
repeated measurements followed by Sidak multiple com-
parisons test and of the shuttle box PAT (Fig.  3b) was 
done by Mantel–Cox survival test; both in GraphPad 
Prism and the null hypothesis was rejected at the 0.05 
level.
