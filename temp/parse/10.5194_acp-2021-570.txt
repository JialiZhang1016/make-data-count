Abstract. The Earth system models (ESMs) that participated in the sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison
Project (CMIP6) tend to simulate excessive cooling in surface air temperature (TAS) between 1960 and 1990.
The anomalous cooling is pronounced over the Northern Hemisphere (NH) midlatitudes, coinciding with the
rapid growth of anthropogenic sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions, the primary precursor of atmospheric sulfate
aerosols. Structural uncertainties between ESMs have a larger impact on the anomalous cooling than internal
variability. Historical simulations with and without anthropogenic aerosol emissions indicate that the anomalous
cooling in the ESMs is attributed to the higher aerosol burden in these models. The aerosol forcing sensitivity,
estimated as the outgoing shortwave radiation (OSR) response to aerosol concentration changes, cannot well
explain the diversity of pothole cooling (PHC) biases in the ESMs. The relative contributions to aerosol forcing
sensitivity from aerosol–radiation interactions (ARIs) and aerosol–cloud interactions (ACIs) can be estimated
from CMIP6 simulations. We show that even when the aerosol forcing sensitivity is similar between ESMs, the
relative contributions of ARI and ACI may be substantially different. The ACI accounts for between 64 % and
87 % of the aerosol forcing sensitivity in the models and is the main source of the aerosol forcing sensitivity
differences between the ESMs. The ACI can be further decomposed into a cloud-amount term (which depends
linearly on cloud fraction) and a cloud-albedo term (which is independent of cloud fraction, to the ﬁrst order),
with the cloud-amount term accounting for most of the inter-model differences.

Introduction
Surface air temperature (TAS) variation is an essential indi-
cator of climate change, and reproducing the evolution of his-
torical TAS is a crucial criterion for model evaluation. How-
ever, the historical TAS anomaly simulated by the models in
the sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6)
is on average colder than that observed in the mid-20th
century, whereas the CMIP5 models tracked the instrumen-
tal TAS variation quite well (Flynn and Mauritsen, 2020).
This is surprising because the transient climate response in
CMIP6 models is generally higher than in CMIP5 models
(e.g., Flynn and Mauritsen, 2020; Meehl et al., 2020).
As a result of anthropogenic emissions, atmospheric
aerosol concentrations increased along with rising green-
house gases, but with greater decadal variability. Aerosols are
generally not evenly distributed around the planet as green-
house gases, and they have relatively short lifetimes of the
order of a week. Aerosols increased rapidly in the mid-20th
century, predominantly due to US and European emissions.
The rate of change of global aerosol emissions slowed down
in the late 20th century (Hoesly et al., 2018), and the trend

J. Zhang et al.: The role of anthropogenic aerosols in the anomalous cooling from 1960 to 1990
of global emission has been negative since the mid-2000s
(Klimont et al., 2013). There has also been a shift in emission
source regions. European and US emissions have declined
following the introduction of clean air legislation since the
1980s, while Asian emissions have risen due to economic
development. East Asian emissions clearly increased from
2000 to 2005, followed by a decrease with large uncertain-
ties (Aas et al., 2019). The decade-long emission reduction
since 2006 over East China is not well represented by the
CMIP6 emission (Wang et al., 2021).
Although greenhouse warming was concluded to be the
dominant forcing for long-term changes (e.g., Weart, 2008;
Bindoff et al., 2013), multidecadal variability in TAS and the
reduced rate of warming in the mid-20th century in particu-
lar have been attributed to aerosol forcing (e.g., Wilcox et al.,
2013). Ramanathan and Feng (2009) noted that the aerosol
cooling effect might have masked as much as 47 % of the
global warming by greenhouse gases in the year 2005, with
an uncertainty range of 20 %–80 %. The aerosol cooling ef-
fect is mainly attributed to the ability of sulfate particles to
reﬂect incoming solar radiation and modify the microphysi-
cal properties of clouds (e.g., Charlson et al., 1990; Mitchell
et al., 1995; Lohmann and Feichter, 2005). The increase in
anthropogenic aerosols was also responsible for weakening
the hydrological cycle between the 1950s and the 1980s (Wu
et al., 2013).
Previous work has suggested that the anomalous mid-20th
century cooling in the CMIP6 models is the result of ex-
cessive aerosol forcing. Flynn and Mauritsen (2020) sug-
gested that aerosol cooling is too strong in many CMIP6
models because there is no apparent relationship between the
warming trends simulated by models and their transient cli-
mate responses (TCRs) before the 1970s. Dittus et al. (2020)
found that historical simulations can better capture the ob-
served historical record by reducing the aerosol emissions in
HadGEM3-GC3.1, demonstrating an overly strong aerosol
cooling effect. In this study we characterize the mid-20th
century excessive cooling in CMIP6 Earth system models
(ESMs). In order to quantify the role of aerosol processes
in this anomalous cooling, historical experiments with and
without anthropogenic aerosol emissions are employed. The
remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 in-
troduces the models, data, and a quantitative method to sep-
arate the aerosol forcing components. The major features of
anomalous cooling in CMIP6 ESMs are examined in Sect. 3.
Section 4 investigates the possible reasons for the anomalous
cooling. The relative importance of aerosol–radiation inter-
actions and aerosol–cloud interactions in each ESM is quan-
tiﬁed and discussed in Sect. 5. Conclusion is given in Sect. 6.

Model, data, and method
2.1
CMIP6 ESMs
CMIP6 includes an unprecedented number of models with
representations of aerosol–cloud interactions. Many also
have interactive tropospheric chemistry and aerosol schemes.
Six such ESMs are employed in this study: BCC-ESM1 (Wu
et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021), EC-Earth-AerChem (van
Noije et al., 2021), GFDL-ESM4 (Dunne et al., 2020), MPI-
ESM-1-2-HAM (Neubauer et al., 2019), NorESM2-LM (Se-
land et al., 2020), and UKESM1-0-LL (Sellar et al., 2019).
The surface air temperature simulated in corresponding mod-
els with lower-complexity is also examined: BCC-CSM2-
MR (Wu et al., 2019b), EC-Earth3 (Döscher et al., 2021), and
MPI-ESM1-2-LR (Mauritsen et al., 2019) with prescribed
tropospheric chemistry and aerosol; GFDL-CM4 (Held et al.,
2019), NorCPM1 (Bethke et al., 2019), and HadGEM3-
GC31-LL (Williams et al., 2017) with a prescribed tro-
pospheric chemistry and interactive aerosol scheme. BCC-
CSM2-MR, EC-Earth3, and MPI-ESM1-2-LR prescribe the
anthropogenic aerosol forcings using the MACv2-SP param-
eterization (Stevens et al., 2017). MACv2-SP approximates
the observationally constrained spatial distributions of the
monthly mean anthropogenic aerosol optical properties and
an associated Twomey effect. A brief summary of the ESMs
and the lower-complexity models is introduced in Table 1.
2.2
Data
The CMIP6 historical experiment and hist-piAer experi-
ment are employed. The historical experiment is forced
by time-evolving, externally imposed natural and anthro-
pogenic forcings, such as solar variability, volcanic aerosols,
greenhouse gases, and aerosol emissions (Eyring et al.,
2016). The hist-piAer experiment is designed by the CMIP6-
endorsed Aerosol Chemistry Model Intercomparison Project
(AerChemMIP; Collins et al., 2017). It is run in parallel with
the historical experiment but ﬁxes aerosol and aerosol pre-
cursor emissions to pre-industrial conditions. Therefore, the
differences between these two experiments are attributable
to anthropogenic aerosol emissions. The design of the hist-
piAer simulation means that it can also capture any non-
linearities resulting from greenhouse-gas-driven changes in
clouds. This is in contrast to the hist-aer simulations available
from the Detection and Attribution Model Intercomparison
Project (DAMIP; Gillett et al., 2016), which resembles the
historical simulations but is only forced by transient changes
in aerosol.
The monthly outputs from historical and hist-piAer sim-
ulations for ESMs are used, including TAS, all-sky outgo-
ing shortwave radiation at the top of atmosphere (OSR),
OSR assuming clear sky (OSRclr), mass mixing ratio of sul-
fate aerosol in the atmosphere (mmrso4), total cloud amount
(CLT), and cloud-top effective droplet radius (reff). These

cesses contributing to the anomalous cooling.

ature (Morice et al., 2021), a blend of the Met Ofﬁce Hadley

Method
By comparing the TAS anomalies in ESMs and the lower-
complexity models with HadCRUT5, our study found that
TAS anomalies from 1960 to 1990 relative to 1850–1900 in
ESMs and most of the lower-complexity models are on aver-
age much lower than observed, resembling a pothole shape.
The magnitude of this anomalous cooling, i.e., the pothole
cooling (PHC), is quantiﬁed as the near-global mean (60◦S
to 65◦N) difference in the TAS anomaly between models and
HadCRUT5 from 1960 to 1990. The variations over the polar
regions (north of 65◦N and south of 60◦S) are not consid-
ered due to the lack of long-term reliable observations (Wu
et al., 2019a).
The aerosol cooling is dominated by the contribution of
sulfate aerosol as estimated by models and observations
(Myhre et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2020). We use the evolu-
tion of sulfate loading (loadSO4) through the historic simu-
lation as a proxy for total aerosol concentration changes to
link estimates of the impact of aerosol forcing. Whilst the
overall impact of aerosol forcing will also depend on other
aerosol species, we adopt this approach because the sulfates
dominate estimates of aerosol forcing during this period and
other aerosols species can be assumed (as a ﬁrst-order ap-
proximation) to have covaried with the SO2 emissions dur-
ing this period as presented by the Community Emissions
Data System (CEDS) inventory adopted by CMIP6 models
(Hoesly et al., 2018). As such when we present estimates
of the aerosol impact/loadSO4 we are presenting the impact
of all aerosol species (including absorbing aerosols such as
black carbon) as they covary with the sulfate concentrations
during the historic period. The motivation for presenting it
in this way is we can separate differences in ESM responses
to changes in aerosol amount from the differences in aerosol
amount (represented by loadSO4) simulated by the ESMs.
We can estimate the impact of anthropogenic aerosol by
using the difference in OSR between the historical and hist-
piAer simulations, 1OSR. 1OSR of course involves any dif-
ferences in natural variability and planetary albedo between
the two simulations, including clear-sky albedo changes and
any adjustments in the microphysical or macroscopic proper-
ties of clouds. The sensitivity of the OSR response to aerosol
changes, i.e., the aerosol forcing sensitivity, can be measured
by the linear ﬁt slope between the annual mean globally aver-
aged OSR differences and loadSO4 differences between the
historical and hist-piAer simulations:
aerosol forcing sensitivity = 1OSR/1loadSO4.
(1)
In this study, we diagnose the OSR differences from histor-
ical simulations that also capture the temperature response.
As such the OSR differences do not represent a measure of
only the aerosol forcing impact but combine OSR differences
arising from both the aerosol forcing and the temperature re-
sponse to this forcing, which we refer to in this paper as the
aerosol forcing sensitivity. It presents a measure of the impor-
tance of aerosol changes in simulated temperature changes
that can be easily calculated for existing transient simula-
tions. The aerosol forcing sensitivity is different from the
commonly used aerosol effective radiative forcing (ERFaer),
which is the change in net TOA downward radiative ﬂux after
allowing adjustments in the atmosphere, but with sea surface
temperatures and sea ice cover ﬁxed at climatological val-
ues. The ERFaer for each ESM except MPI-ESM-1-2-HAM
is listed in Table 3. The ERFaer is not correlated with the
aerosol forcing sensitivity.
The aerosol forcing sensitivity can be further parti-
tioned into a contribution from aerosol–radiation interactions
(ARIs) and aerosol–cloud interactions (ACIs). ARI and ACI
can be readily estimated from the CMIP6 output because an-
nual mean cloud amount (CLT), OSR, and the OSR assum-
ing only clear sky (OSRclr) are available for all the CMIP6
ESMs. For each model, the clear-sky part OSR, OSRclr_p,
can be estimated as (1 −CLT/100.) · OSRclr. The aerosol
forcing sensitivity in the clear-sky part can therefore be esti-
mated as
1OSRclr_p/1loadSO4
= (1 −CLT_hist/100.) · 1OSRclr/1loadSO4
−OSRclr_hist/100 · 1CLT/1loadSO4 + residual_clr,
(2)
where CLT_hist and OSRclr_hist are the mean CLT and OS-
Rclr in the historical experiment. The aerosol forcing sensi-
tivity in the cloudy part are relative to the cloud-amount re-
sponse to aerosol loading and cloud radiative effect changes
and can be estimated as
1OSRcld_p/1loadSO4 = A · 1CLT/1loadSO4
+ cloud-albedo term
+ residual_cld.
(3)
Therefore, the aerosol forcing sensitivity can be decom-
posed as

to 1loadSO4 and therefore measures the strength of the
aerosol–radiation interactions in each model. The ﬁrst term
on the right-hand side of Eq. (4), (1 −CLT_hist/100.) · M,
can therefore be identiﬁed with ARI. The parameter A is the
slope of a linear ﬁt of 1OSRcld to 1CLT and therefore mea-
sures the correlation of the shortwave radiation reﬂected by
clouds with changes in cloud amount. That is, the parame-
ter A represents the baseline cloud albedo which is sensi-
tive to the cloud parameterizations via cloud droplet number
concentration (CDNC), cloud-droplet effective radius, and
other factors. The parameter N is the slope of a linear ﬁt
of 1CLT to 1loadSO4 and therefore measures the sensitiv-
ity of cloud amount to aerosols. Note that changes in cloud
amount by deﬁnition also affect the fraction of clear sky;
hence, increases in OSRcld due to increases in CLT (i.e.,
A · N) can be partly offset by changes in area of clear sky
containing aerosols (OSRclr_hist/100.·N). The second term
on the right-hand side of Eq. (4), (A−OSRclr_hist/100.)·N,
can therefore contribute to the ACI. Speciﬁcally, it is the part
of ACI that is linearly proportional to changes to cloud frac-
tion, which we will refer to in this paper as the cloud-amount
term. It is therefore sensitive to any aerosol-induced cloud
fraction changes (Lohmann and Feichter, 2005), including
any slow adjustments in clouds due to feedbacks within the
Earth system.
In addition to depending on 1CLT, ACI is also inﬂuenced
by any changes in cloud albedo that might occur indepen-
dently of cloud-amount changes. Such adjustments would in-
clude increases in cloud droplet number concentration and
increases in simulated cloud-droplet effective radius without
accompanying changes in cloud cover. Changes purely in the
brightness of clouds, without changes in macroscopic prop-
erties of clouds, are difﬁcult to identify from the CMIP6 out-
put because all the bulk properties of clouds co-vary over the
course of the projections. However, subtracting ARI and the
cloud-amount term from the aerosol forcing sensitivity gives
a residual that is, by deﬁnition, linearly independent of cloud
fraction differences (since by construction these have been
regressed out). This residual can then be interpreted as due to
differences in the albedo of clouds between the historical and
hist-piAer and will be called the “cloud-albedo term”. Note
that this method of calculation implies that purely albedo ef-
fects cannot be distinguished from general residual terms that
result from the linear approximation made.
Decomposition of the ARI, the cloud-amount term, and
cloud-albedo term of ACI is detailed further in the Appendix.
The aerosol–cloud feedbacks are mainly in the ACI term
which includes cloud spatial extent (amount), cloud albedo
on radiative ﬂuxes, and cloud particle swelling by humid-
iﬁcation (Christensen et al., 2017; Neubauer et al., 2017).
There is also a (smaller) effect of feedback on the ARI term
that is also affected by cloud-amount changes insofar as in-
creased/decreased cloud cover can obscure/reveal clear-sky
radiative ﬂuxes. We acknowledge that the linear approxima-
tion in our method does not explicitly account for the absorp-
tion above clouds or the adjustments to aerosol–radiation in-
teractions (e.g., Carslaw et al., 2013) that are known to be
locally important. Our formulation explicitly assumes that

there is a broadly linear relationship between (i) loadSO4 and
emissions and (ii) aerosol radiation with loadSO4 (and non-
linearity due to cloud albedo or amount or any interaction
is small at global scale as suggested in Booth et al., 2018).
Should these interaction terms be non-negligible in this anal-
ysis, we still expect the broader attribution of the reasons for
the model diversity in temperature response over the PHC pe-
riod, either how they simulate aerosol concentrations or how
they simulate the response to this, to generally hold.
This decomposition method is an approximate approach
designed to be used with existing simulations, rather than
a strict decomposition by dedicated simulations/output vari-
ables not included in CMIP6. It cannot tell us precise infor-
mation about each interaction and adjustment, but it can give
us an indication of why models behave differently.

The pothole bias in CMIP6 ESMs
Figure 1a shows the near-global averaged time series of the
annual mean TAS anomaly relative to 1850 to 1900 in Had-
CRUT5 during the historical period from 1850 to 2014, as
well as the ensemble means for each model except for EC-
Earth3-AerChem and GFDL-ESM4 (where only a single re-
alization is available for the hist-piAer experiment). The un-
forced, long-term drifts in TAS may occur in some of the
ESMs, as estimated by their control simulation under pre-
industrial conditions (Yool et al., 2020). We have not ac-
counted for long-term control simulation drifts in our study
as we are assuming that our focus on inter-decadal-scale vari-
ability of TAS anomalies is likely to be fairly insensitive to
any century-scale drifts.
The TAS anomaly in HadCRUT5 is generally above the
baseline climate from the 1940s onwards and warms fastest
from the 1980s to 1990s. Compared with the observations, all
the ESM simulations have negative TAS anomaly biases after
the 1940s, which are also evident in the ensemble-mean his-
torical TAS of 25 CMIP6 models with and without interac-
tive chemistry schemes (Flynn and Mauritsen, 2020). In the
ESMs and their ensemble mean (MMM), the cold anomaly
biases resemble a pothole shape (Fig. 1a), which is relatively
small before the 1950s and after the 2000s but prominent
from the 1960s to 1990s. To reduce the impact of the change
in the spatial pattern of the emissions in the late 20th cen-
tury and the Pinatubo eruption in the early 1990s, we mainly
focus on the excessively cold anomaly from 1960 to 1990
in this study. The impacts from the Agung (1963) and El

Chichón (1982) eruptions have been left in the PHC period
as their effect on the simulated temperature is not as pro-
nounced as the response to Pinatubo and are short-lived in
time compared to the period we study. The period of anoma-
lous cold in the global mean from 1960 to 1990 in model
simulations is deﬁned as the pothole cooling (PHC). Table 3
shows the TAS anomaly biases in two periods: the pre-PHC
period (1929–1959) and the PHC period (1960–1990). The
cold bias in the MMM is −0.14 in the pre-PHC period and
intensiﬁed to −0.40 in the PHC period. The PHC bias ranges
from −0.20 to −0.58 ◦C among the ESMs with a standard
deviation of 0.11 ◦C. Intra-model spread of PHC is relatively
smaller. That is, model structural uncertainty is more respon-
sible for PHC than internal climate variability.
The PHC bias is generally smaller in the corresponding
lower-complexity models (Fig. 1b and Table 3). For mod-
els with prescribed chemistry and aerosol (BCC-CSM2-MR
and MPI-ESM1-2-LR), the TAS anomaly is reasonably re-
produced during the pre-PHC period and the PHC period.
The PHC bias is large (−0.37 ◦C) in EC-Earth3, which has
prescribed chemistry and aerosol. The large bias may be a re-
ﬂection of the large internal variability on TAS in EC-Earth3
(Döscher et al., 2021), for which we have only one mem-
ber. For models with a prescribed chemistry and interactive
aerosol scheme (GFDL-CM4 and HadGEM3-GC31-LL), the
cold biases during the PHC period are comparable with that
in the corresponding ESMs.
The spatial and temporal evolution of annually averaged
TAS anomalies are further examined (Fig. 2). In HadCRUT5,
TAS anomalies are generally positive after the 1940s. The
most signiﬁcant TAS anomalies are evident in the late 20th
century and at the beginning of the 21st century, especially
over the NH midlatitudes. The results from BCC-CSM2-
MR and MPI-ESM1-2-LR agree well with the observations.
However, the ESMs and the other lower-complexity models
simulate pronounced cold anomalies over NH subtropical-
to-high latitudes during the PHC period. The overestimated
tropical and southern hemispheric warming in NorCPM1 off-
sets most of the cooling biases over NH subtropical-to-high
latitudes.
Surface anthropogenic SO2 emissions rapidly increase
during the PHC period (the line contours in Fig. 2). The
latitudes of the cooling centers in the ESMs and lower-
complexity models with an interactive aerosol scheme are
spatially co-located with the SO2 emission sources – North
America and East Asia (at around 30◦N) and western Europe
(at around 50◦N). Generally, the different behaviors seen in
Figs. 1 and 2 suggest that aerosol forcings may be overes-
timated in the ESMs and lower-complexity models with an
interactive aerosol scheme, and the anomalous cooling is a
result of the extra complexity associated with aerosol pro-
cesses.
During the PHC period, the TAS anomalies in HadCRUT5
are generally positive and are the largest over Eurasia and
North America (Fig. 3a). The warm anomalies are on av-
erage more than 0.4 ◦C along the 30–60◦N latitudinal belt.
However, the ESMs show anomalies with the opposite sign
(Fig. 3b–g) as do the lower-complexity models with an in-
teractive aerosol scheme (ﬁgures not shown). The PHC is
pronounced over major SO2 emission centers (western Eu-
rope, East Asia, and the eastern US) and their downstream
regions. The cold anomalies over Eurasia and North Amer-
ica are lower than −0.6◦C in the ESMs. The PHC biases are
strongest at lower levels (ﬁgures not shown), which is distinct
from the ampliﬁed upper-tropospheric warming response to
greenhouse gases.

Possible reasons for the excessive cooling
The differences between the historical and hist-piAer simula-
tions help to investigate the impact of anthropogenic aerosol
emissions and their possible contribution to the PHC biases.
In this section, we examine the TAS, OSR, and sulfate load-
ing differences and look in detail at their relationship. As
shown by the evolution of TAS anomalies in the two exper-
iments (Fig. 4a1–6), during the PHC period, TAS anomalies
in HadCRUT5 (black line) are higher than those in the his-
torical members but lower than those in the hist-piAer mem-
bers in all ESMs. That is, the model responses to anthro-
pogenic aerosol emissions are larger than the amplitude of
the PHC. The temporal evolution of the OSR corresponds
with that of the TAS but occurs in the opposite direction
(Fig. 4b1–6). The sulfate loading differences are relatively
small in the 19th century, mildly increase in the ﬁrst half
of the 20th century, grow most rapidly during the PHC pe-
riod, and remain high afterward (Fig. 4c1–6). The growing
sulfate loading during the PHC period corresponds with the
increase in Northern Hemisphere anthropogenic surface SO2
emissions (line contours in Fig. 2). In comparison with the
TAS and OSR differences, the intra-model spread of sulfate
loading for each ESM is relatively small. However, the inter-
model diversity of sulfate loading is large. For example, the
sulfate loading difference between the historical and hist-
piAer experiments around the year 2000 is about 4 mgm−2 in
EC-Earth3-AerChem, almost twice of that in GFDL-ESM4.
With similar anthropogenic SO2 emission rates, the lower
sulfate loading difference in GFDL-ESM4 indicates it has a
shorter sulfate aerosol residence time than that in EC-Earth3-
AerChem, which may be due to their different sulfate pro-
duction and deposition schemes. The sulfate loading diver-
sity is also evident in CMIP5 models and is partly respon-
sible for the diversity in modeled radiative forcing (Wilcox
et al., 2015).
The latitudinal movement of the SO2 emission center from
the 1990s affects the relative strength of aerosol forcing. Due
to the more rapid oxidation and higher incoming solar ﬂux
at lower latitudes, an equatorward shift in SO2 emissions
around the 1990s results in a more efﬁcient production of
sulfate and stronger aerosol forcing (Manktelow et al., 2007).

The anomalies are relative to the 1850–1900 mean. Units: ◦C.
The northern midlatitude temperature is also more sensitive
to the distribution of aerosols, which is approximately twice
as large as the global average (Collins et al., 2013; Shin-
dell and Faluvegi, 2009). Therefore, we focus on the rela-
tionships between TAS, OSR, and sulfate loading after 1900
when SO2 emission changes are dominated by its anthro-
pogenic component, as well as before 1990. As shown in
Fig. 5a, the TAS differences between the historical and hist-
piAer simulations vary approximately linearly with the dif-
ferences in the sulfate loading. The OSR differences are ap-
proximately linearly correlated with sulfate loading differ-
ences (Fig. 5b). In both cases, the approximation of linear-
ity holds less well for UKESM1-0-LL, especially at small
sulfate loadings. This reﬂects the behavior of HadGEM2, a
predecessor of UKESM1-0-LL (Wilcox et al., 2015), and is
likely to be due to the strong aerosol–cloud-albedo effect in
these models. The global mean annual mean reff decreases
by about 0.7 µm since pre-industrial era – more than twice
the magnitude of change seen in the other models (Fig. 1b in
Wilcox et al., 2015; Fig. 9b in this study).
The slope of the linear ﬁtting equation between TAS
(OSR) and sulfate loading as shown in the captions in Fig. 5a
(Fig. 5b) is a measure of the sensitivity of TAS (aerosol forc-
ing) to perturbations in atmospheric aerosol. Moreover, TAS
response and aerosol forcing sensitivity are linearly corre-
lated across the ESMs (Fig. 5c). That is, the strength of the
TAS response can be understood as the magnitude of aerosol
forcing sensitivity within each ESM. The TAS response and
aerosol forcing sensitivity is the lowest in GFDL-ESM4. The
TAS response and aerosol forcing sensitivity in UKESM1-0-
LL (the purple marker in Fig. 5c) are the strongest, as well
as their intra-model spread (the length of arrows), indicat-
ing that TAS and aerosol forcing in this model are relatively
more susceptible to changes in aerosol.

lies and aerosol loading (Fig. 5a), as well as the impact of

However, the relationship between the PHC biases and
the aerosol forcing sensitivity among the ESMs is not
clear: ESMs have similar PHC biases (MPI-ESM-1-2-HAM,
NorESM2-LM, and UKESM1-0-LL) that show large differ-
ences in the aerosol forcing sensitivity, ranging from 0.78
to 1.5 Wmg−1; the aerosol forcing sensitivity in EC-Earth3-
AerChem is close to that in BCC-ESM1, but the PHC is

in UKESM1-0-LL is the strongest (∼1.5 Wmg−1) but not

able to explain the different PHC biases among ESMs.

tween the historical and hist-piAer experiments during the
PHC period are large among ESMs (the x axis), which

are about 1.5 mgm−2 in GFDL-ESM4 but approximately
2.9 mgm−2 in EC-Earth3-AerChem. The sulfate loading dif-
ferences during the PHC period and PHC biases show a neg-
ative correlation: the PHC bias is generally larger in models
with higher sulfate loading over this period; the ESMs with
similar PHC biases (MPI-ESM1-2-LR, NorESM2-LM, and
UKESM1-0-LL) show similar aerosol loading differences.
Therefore, the excessive cooling during the PHC period and
the inter-model diversity in ESMs are attributed to the higher
aerosol burden in these models.

Discussion
5.1
The proportions of ARI and ACI
Although the aerosol forcing sensitivity is not responsible for
the anomalous cooling biases in ESMs, it is a good way to
identify model differences in the response to aerosol changes.
As shown in Fig. 5c, there are signiﬁcant differences in the
aerosol forcing sensitivity among ESMs. The aerosol forc-
ing sensitivity in UKESM1-0-LL is almost 3 times of that in

GFDL-ESM4. Due to the uncertainties in physical processes
and cloud parameterizations, the dominant component (ARI
or ACI) of aerosol forcing sensitivity may also vary among
ESMs. Here, we separate the different components of the
aerosol forcing sensitivity in each ESM by the method in-
troduced in the Sect. 2.3 and the Appendix. Sulfate loading
is used as a proxy of aerosol amount for all aerosol compo-
nents in the quantiﬁcation of the total effect because of its
dominant contribution to anthropogenic aerosol load during
this period and its covariation with the other aerosol species.
The ARI can be approximated to (1−CLT_hist/100.)·M,
where CLT_hist is cloud amount in the historical simulation
and parameter M is a measure of the strength of aerosol–
radiation interactions (1OSRclr/1loadSO4). Parameter M
varies widely from about 0.35 Wmg−1 in NorESM2-LM to
about 0.79 Wmg−1 in BCC-ESM1 (captions in Fig. 7a–c).
Since parameter M does not change much among ensemble
members in each ESM, their ARI is similar across members.
That is, the impact of internal climate variability on the ARI
is relatively small, which is consistent with the quantitative
analysis in Fig. 8 (red bars).
The ACI can be estimated from the difference between
the aerosol forcing sensitivity and the ARI. The proportion
of the aerosol forcing sensitivity arising from the ACI is
higher than 64 % in all ESMs (Fig. 8). The inter-model vari-
ation of the ACI (0.37 Wmg−1) is much larger than that for

the ARI (0.09 Wmg−1). For example, the ACI in UKESM1-
0-LL (∼1.2 Wmg−1) is higher than all the others and is
about 3 times of that in GFDL-ESM4 (0.41 Wmg−1). This
demonstrates that differences in the aerosol forcing sensitiv-
ity across the ESMs are dominated by the differences in their
individual representation of ACI. Chen et al. (2014) also sug-
gested that ACI is the main contribution to the aerosol radia-
tive forcing uncertainty, and the response of marine clouds
to aerosol changes is paramount. The intra-model variations
in the ACI are also larger than that for the ARI. That is be-
cause the intra-model variations of the ACI are inﬂuenced by
the effects of climate system internal variability on aerosol-
induced cloud microphysics, with cloud radiative properties
and cloud lifetimes varying regionally. The intra-model vari-
ations are also attributable to the differences in atmospheric
circulation among different ensemble members, which may
affect the geographical distributions of aerosols and clouds
and lead to a different magnitude of interactions.
The quantitative analysis in Fig. 8 also indicates that ESMs
with similar aerosol forcing sensitivity may have different
contributions from ARI and ACI. The aerosol forcing sensi-
tivity is similar in BCC-ESM1, EC-Earth3-AerChem, MPI-
ESM-1-2-HAM, and NorESM2-LM, but the fractional con-
tribution from the ACI is the largest in NorESM2-LM, and its
ARI is less than half of that in BCC-ESM1. Generally, BCC-
ESM1 has the largest fractional ARI contribution (34 %),
whereas NorESM2-LM has the largest fraction of ACI con-
tribution (86 %).

5.2
The proportions of cloud-amount and cloud-albedo
terms
Our ACI metric includes several mechanisms by which
aerosols can alter cloud properties. This includes the cloud-
albedo effects (or Twomey effect), referred to as the radiative
forcing part of ACI, and effects of aerosols on the macro-
scopic properties of clouds (for example, cloud extent and
lifetime), referred to as the adjustment part of ACI. How-
ever, it is complicated to separate these two parts of ACI di-
rectly using available CMIP6 diagnostics, because the for-
mer is most accurately deﬁned as a change in cloud albedo
with all other cloud properties held constant (i.e., a change in
cloud-droplet number concentration only), whilst the latter
allows cloud properties to respond.
Figure 9 shows the evolution of global mean differences in
total cloud amount (1CLT) and cloud-top effective droplet
radius (1reff) between the historical and hist-piAer exper-
iments. The 1CLT and 1reff in UKESM1-0-LL are the
largest and highly correlated with each other (with a corre-
lation coefﬁcient of −0.92 during the 1900 to 1990 period).
For the other two ESMs for which 1reff was archived, the
correlation coefﬁcient is −0.40 for MPI-ESM-1-2-HAM and
insigniﬁcant for GFDL-ESM4 (−0.09). The 1CLT and 1reff
differences are smaller in MPI-ESM-1-2-HAM and GFDL-
ESM4 than in UKESM1-0-LL, especially for the 1reff dif-
ferences. 1reff is generally related to the cloud optical depth
https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-18609-2021

18622
J. Zhang et al.: The role of anthropogenic aerosols in the anomalous cooling from 1960 to 1990
and cloud water path, and 1CLT is related to adjustments
in cloud cover due to ACI. Therefore, the radiative forcing
part and adjustment part of ACI may be closely coupled in
UKESM1-0-LL and are hard to separate statistically. The
strong correlation between cloud amount and reff response
in UKESM1-0-LL indicates that this model is sensitive to
aerosol–cloud interactions, which likely contributes to it hav-
ing the strongest aerosol forcing sensitivity and intra-model
spread of all the CMIP6 models (Fig. 5c). MPI-ESM-1-2-
HAM and UKESM1-0-LL have similar ensemble mean PHC
biases and close sulfate burden, but the aerosol forcing sen-
sitivity difference in UKESM1-0-LL is almost twice of that
in MPI-ESM-1-2-HAM (Fig. 5). That is, the overestimated
sulfate burden dominates the PHC biases, but the ACI sensi-
tivity may partly affect the amplitude and uncertainty ranges
of PHC biases.
Despite of the closely coupled radiative forcing part and
adjustment part of ACI in UKESM1-0-LL, it is still possi-
ble to split the ACI into a part that is correlated with cloud-
amount differences and a residual term. This can be done
statistically by regressing out the approximate linear depen-
dence of the differences between historical and hist-piAer
simulations of the cloudy part of OSR (OSRcld_p) on cloud
fraction in each ESM (parameter A in Fig. 7g–i). We call
the degree of linear correlation of 1OSRcld_p with 1CLT
the “cloud-amount term”, and the residual will be referred
to as the “cloud-albedo term”. However, we reiterate that the
so-called “cloud-amount term” may also include changes in
the reﬂectivity of clouds if these are correlated with changes
in cloud amount. Similarly, the cloud-albedo term will con-
tain any sources of cloud-amount changes which have not
been removed by linearly regressing OSRcld_p against cloud
amount. As such, we do not intend for this nomenclature to
indicate a precise separation of the radiative forcing part and
adjustment part of ACI. Our decomposition allows ﬁrst-order
assessment of these terms from historical simulations with-
out the need for extra simulations or calls and also allows
estimates from observations and intermodel comparisons.
As described in the Sect. 2.3 and the Appendix, the
cloud-amount term is sensitive to two parameters: the cloud-
amount response (parameter N in Fig. 7d–f) and the sensitiv-
ity of OSR reﬂected from clouds to cloud-amount changes
(parameter A, Fig. 7g–i). As shown in Fig. 8, UKESM1-
0-LL has the largest contribution of the cloud-amount
term to aerosol forcing sensitivity (62 %, 0.91 Wmg−1);
the cloud-amount term is the smallest in GFDL-ESM4
(∼0.18 Wmg−1). The cloud-albedo term is deﬁned to be lin-
early independent of cloud-amount changes (adjustments).
For the CMIP6 ESMs, it can only be estimated as the residual
after subtracting the cloud-amount term from the ACI. The
cloud-albedo term is similar in BCC-ESM1, MPI-ESM-1-2-
HAM, and NorESM2-LM. The inter-model variation for the
cloud-amount term is about twice of that for the cloud-albedo
term (0.29 Wmg−1 vs. 0.16 Wmg−1). That is, the varia-
tions of cloud-amount term are the major source of inter-
model ACI (and the aerosol forcing sensitivity) differences
between ESMs. Therefore, difference in the cloud-amount
terms, across the ESMs, dominates the uncertainties in the
aerosol forcing sensitivity.
Note that our deﬁnitions do not correspond to the effects
measured by using multiple calls to the radiation scheme of
a model, with and without aerosols, which measure instanta-
neous radiative effects; multiple calls give a measure of the
fast response of clouds to aerosol perturbations in a ﬁxed
thermodynamic and dynamical background, allowing for a
clear separation between ACI and rapid adjustments (e.g.,
Bellouin et al., 2013). This differs from aerosol forcing di-
agnosed by differencing climate projections with different
aerosol forcings, which include the slow effects of other feed-
backs. For example, differences in climate forcings can lead
to different SST patterns, which in turn alter the location and
characteristics of clouds. Despite these differences, an advan-
tage of our classiﬁcation is that it provides a possible method
for model evaluation since the variables used are also, in prin-
ciple, available from the observations.

Conclusions
This study focuses on the reproduction of historical surface
air temperature anomalies in six CMIP6 ESMs. The ESMs
systematically underestimate TAS anomalies relative to 1850
to 1900 in the NH midlatitudes, especially from 1960 to
1990, the pothole cooling (PHC) period. Previous studies
suggested that aerosol cooling is too strong in many CMIP6
models. Our study more speciﬁcally found that the PHC is
concurrent in time and space with anthropogenic SO2 emis-
sions, which rapidly increase in the PHC period in NH. Mod-
els with larger aerosol burdens have larger PHC biases. The
primary role of aerosol emissions in these biases is further
supported by the differences between ESMs and the lower-
complexity models with prescribed aerosol.
Differences between historical simulations and simula-
tions with aerosol emissions ﬁxed at their pre-industrial lev-
els (hist-piAer) are used to isolate the impacts of industrial
aerosol emission. We propose that the overestimated aerosol
concentrations in the ESMs are responsible for the spurious
drop in TAS in the mid-20th century, rather than a high sensi-
tivity of the models to aerosol forcing. Although the aerosol
forcing sensitivity differences in ESMs cannot explain the
PHC biases, they are a good measurement of aerosol effects
that can be used to explore structural differences between
models. A simple metric is derived for determining the domi-
nant contribution to the aerosol forcing sensitivity in any spe-
ciﬁc model: ARI or ACI. The ACI accounts for more than
64 % of the aerosol forcing sensitivity in all analyzed ESMs.
The considerable inter-model variation in the aerosol forc-
ing sensitivity is mainly attributable to the uncertainty in the
ACI within models. The ACI can be further decomposed into
a cloud-amount term and a cloud-albedo term. The cloud-

amount term is found to be the major source of inter-model
diversity of ACI. Considering the crucial role of cloud prop-
erties on the inter-model spread in aerosol forcing sensitivity,
the aerosol–cloud interactions should be a focus in the devel-
opment of aerosol schemes within ESMs.

interaction and aerosol–cloud interaction
Considering the dominant role of sulfate aerosol on an-
thropogenic aerosol forcing, we use the sulfate loading
(loadSO4) as a proxy for all aerosol in our analysis. The
aerosol forcing sensitivity (as determined by the difference
between the historical and hist-piAer experiments) is esti-
mated by the all-sky OSR differences per sulfate burden unit
(1OSR/1loadSO4), and it is the combination of OSR dif-
ferences in the clear-sky parts (1OSRclr_p/1loadSO4) and
the cloudy parts (1OSRcld_p/1loadSO4):
1OSR/1loadSO4 = 1OSRclr_p/1loadSO4
+ 1OSRcld_p/1loadSO4.
(A1)
The OSRclr_p for a particular experiment can be calcu-
lated as
OSRclr_p = (1 −CLT/100.) · OSRclr,
(A2)
where CLT is the total cloud amount (unit: %), and OS-
Rclr is the OSR assuming all clear sky (unit: Wm−2).
The cloud-amount changes (1CLT) will modify the pro-
portion of clear sky and then affect the OSR changes
attributed to the clear-sky part by covering or uncover-
ing aerosols in clear sky. Therefore, based on Eq. (A2),
1OSRclr_p/1loadSO4 can be decomposed into the OS-
Rclr response (1OSRclr/1loadSO4) and CLT response
(1CLT/1loadSO4):
1OSRclr_p/1loadSO4
= (1 −CLT_hist/100.) · 1OSRclr/1loadSO4
−OSRclr_hist/100 · 1CLT/1loadSO4 + residual_clrp
= (1 −CLT_hist/100.) · M −OSRclr_hist/100 · N
+ residual_clr,
(A3)
where CLT_hist and OSRclr_hist are the mean CLT and OS-
Rclr in the historical experiment. Residual_clr is the resid-
ual term that is non-linear in 1OSRclr and 1CLT. The pa-
rameter M = 1OSRclr/1loadSO4 is related to the strength
of the aerosol–radiation interaction and can be estimated
by linear ﬁtting of 1OSRclr on 1loadSO4. The parame-
ter N = 1CLT/1loadSO4 is related to CLT response and
estimated by linear ﬁtting of 1CLT on 1loadSO4. There-
fore, the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of Eq. (A3), (1 −
CLT_hist/100.) · M, corresponds to the aerosol radiative ef-
fect; the second term, −OSRclr_hist/100·N, corresponds to
the impact of changes in the clear-sky area.
The OSRcld_p is the cloudy part of OSR, accounting for
the difference between OSR and OSRclr_p. The cloudy part
of the OSR differences (1OSRcld_p) can be generally esti-
mated as
1OSRcld_p = A · 1CLT + cloud-albedo relative changes
+ residual_cld,
where the parameter A = 1(OSR−OSRclr_p)/1CLT is the
sensitivity of the shortwave ﬂux reﬂected by clouds to
changes in cloud amount. The parameter A depends on the
baseline cloud albedo (radiative ﬂux per cloud-amount unit)
and can be estimated by linear ﬁtting of 1OSRcld_p on
1CLT. Hence,
1OSRcld_p/1loadSO4
= A · 1CLT/1loadSO4
+ cloud-albedo term + residual_cld,
= A · N + cloud-albedo term + residual_cld,
(A4)
where N is the parameter deﬁned above. Therefore, the ﬁrst
term on the right-hand side of Eq. (A4), A·N, corresponds to
the impact of cloud-amount changes on the cloud radiation;
and the cloud-albedo term can be obtained as a residual af-
ter subtracting A · N from 1OSRcld_p/1loadSO4, thereby
eliminating any linear dependence of the cloudy-sky short-
wave ﬂux response on cloud-amount changes.
As with the clear-sky decomposition, residual_cld is a
possible non-linear term and is assumed to be small. This
term cannot in fact be distinguished from the cloud-albedo
term in this analysis: we must therefore accept that cloud-
albedo changes could be accompanied by non-linear changes
in macroscopic cloud properties (in this framework).
The total aerosol forcing sensitivity can be measured by
substituting the derived values of 1OSR/1loadSO4 from
both the clear sky (Eq. A3) and cloudy (Eq. A4) parts back
into Eq. (A1):
1OSR/1loadSO4
= (1 −CLT_hist/100.) · M −OSRclr_hist/100 · N
+ A · N + cloud_albedo_term + residual
= (1 −CLT_hist/100) · M + (A −OSRclr_hist/100.) · N
+ cloud_albedo_term + residual_osr.
(A5)
Based on Eq. (A5), the total aerosol forcing sensitivity can
therefore be decomposed to the aerosol–radiation interaction
term (ARI), (1 −CLT_hist/100.) · M, cloud-amount term as
(A −OSRclr_hist/100.) · N including the impacts of cloud-
amount changes on aerosol radiation (−OSRclr_hist/100. ·
N) and cloud radiation (A · N), and cloud-albedo term (de-
ﬁned as a residual).
