Abstract 
56 
Sleep is fundamental to the health and fitness of all animals. The physiological importance of 
57 
sleep is underscored by the central role of homeostasis in determining sleep investment – following 
58 
periods of sleep deprivation, individuals experience longer and more intense sleep bouts. Yet, most 
59 
studies of sleep have been conducted in highly controlled settings, disconnected from the ecological 
60 
and social context that may exert pressures on sleep patterns in conflict with homeostatic regulation. 
61 
Using tri-axial accelerometry and GPS to track the sleep patterns of a group of wild baboons (Papio 
62 
anubis) at multiple temporal and spatial scales, we found that ecological and social pressures indeed 
63 
interfere with homeostatic sleep regulation. Baboons sacrificed time spent sleeping when in less 
64 
familiar locations and when sleeping in proximity to more group-mates, regardless of how much they 
65 
had slept the prior night or how much they had physically exerted themselves the preceding day. 
66 
Moreover, we found that the collective dynamics characteristic of social animal groups persist into the 
67 
sleep period, as baboons exhibited synchronized patterns of waking throughout the night, particularly 
68 
with nearby group-mates. Thus, for animals whose fitness depends critically on avoiding predation 
69 
and developing social relationships, maintaining sleep homeostasis may be only secondary to 
70 
remaining vigilant when sleeping in risky habitats and interacting with group-mates during the night. 
71 
Our results highlight the importance of studying sleep in ecologically relevant contexts, where the 
72 
adaptive function of sleep patterns directly reflect the complex trade-offs that have guided its 
73 
evolution.  
74 
Introduction 
75 
Sleep is an important and understudied facet of animal lives, with every species, from honey 
76 
bees to humans, allocating a portion of every day to this period of rest (Cirelli & Tononi, 2008). The 
77 
universality of sleep reflects its central role in important physiological processes, including memory 
78 
consolidation, support of the central nervous system, energy conservation and physical restoration 
79 
(Chowdhury & Shafer, 2020; Gangwisch, 2014; Stickgold, 2005; Vyazovskiy, 2015). Accordingly, 
80 
failure to meet daily sleep demand has health consequences (Basner et al., 2013), with potentially 
81 
fatal repercussions of extreme sleep deprivation (Rechtschaffen & Bergmann, 2002). The 
82 
physiological need for sleep is emphasized by its homeostatic control – after periods of insufficient 
83 
sleep or extreme physical exertion, individuals experience particularly long and intense bouts of sleep 
84 
(Kitamura et al., 2016). Decades of sleep research have consistently implicated homeostasis as a 
85 
primary determinant of sleep patterns, such that homeostatic regulation has become an important 
86 
criterion in the very definition of sleep (Siegel, 2008). 
87 
A strong focus on studying sleep in the laboratory or at the bedside, although revealing much 
88 
about the physiology of sleep, has inherently overlooked the ecological pressures that drive the 
89 
regulation and evolution of sleep (Rattenborg et al., 2017; Reinhardt, 2020). In the natural world, the 
90 
significance of sleep extends beyond its direct physiological impacts. Sleeping animals typically 
91 
cannot engage in other behaviors that are important to their survival (but see Rattenborg et al., 2016), 
92

and investing in sleep when environmental forces render vigilance and activity particularly important 
93 
may impose substantial costs to wild animals. In addition to preventing animals from foraging, 
94 
searching for mating opportunities, defending territories, and caring for young, sleep leaves animals in 
95 
a state of extreme inattention, and thus highly vulnerable to their predators (Lima et al., 2005). The 
96 
evolution of sleep and its manifestation in the wild may therefore be driven by a complex balance 
97 
between the physiological need for sleep and ecological costs imposed on sleeping animals.  
98 
 
For gregarious animals, the balance between the costs and benefits of sleep may be further 
99 
modulated by the social environment. However, even the most basic aspects of sleeping with 
100 
conspecifics, such as whether the social context facilitates or constrains sleep, remain unknown 
101 
(Karamihalev et al., 2019). Sleeping in a social context could alter the costs of sleep – the sentinel 
102 
hypothesis suggests that staggering the timing of sleep bouts in a group can collectively maintain both 
103 
high quality sleep and high levels of anti-predator vigilance (Samson et al., 2017; Snyder, 1966). 
104 
Sleeping in a group may therefore facilitate an individual’s ability to fulfill its physiological 
105 
requirements for sleep by reducing the risk of doing so. Alternatively, social dynamics may actually 
106 
inhibit investment in sleep. Sleep may present social opportunity costs, causing individuals to 
107 
sacrifice sleep in order to spend more time actively engaging with group-mates. Additionally, 
108 
proximity to group-mates may cause cascading disruptions initiated by short periods of wakeful 
109 
activity of neighboring individuals. Thus, sleeping in close proximity to conspecifics may potentially 
110 
be accompanied by both costs and benefits for an individual’s ability to obtain sufficient sleep, and 
111 
discovering how these potential costs and benefits are actually realized will shed light on the forces 
112 
that have guided sleep adaptations in social animals. 
113 
To understand how group-living animals navigate tradeoffs between their physiological need 
114 
for sleep and the ecological and social pressures that shape the costs and benefits associated with this 
115 
biological imperative, we investigated the factors shaping sleep patterns of wild olive baboons (Papio 
116 
anubis). Baboons live in stable multi-male, multi-female groups of up to 100 individuals (Cheney & 
117 
Seyfarth, 2008), and during the night, they seek safety in trees and rock outcroppings (Altmann & 
118 
Altmann, 1970; Busse, 1980). Despite seeking refuge in these sleep sites, baboons remain particularly 
119 
vulnerable to nighttime predation from leopards, which represents the single largest source of 
120 
mortality for adult baboons (Cheney et al., 2004; Cowlishaw, 1994; Isbell et al., 2018). Baboons must 
121 
therefore navigate the tradeoff between investing in sleep and maintaining anti-predator vigilance. As 
122 
a highly gregarious animal whose fitness depends heavily on their social relationships (Silk et al., 
123 
2009), baboons must also balance their time spent sleeping with their investment in social 
124 
interactions, as time constraints during the day limit their ability to build and maintain their 
125 
relationships (Dunbar, 1992). 
126 
We simultaneously tracked the activity of 26 wild olive baboons from the same group using 
127 
collars fitted with GPS sensors and tri-axial accelerometers to understand how baboons manage their 
128 
competing nighttime priorities. Accelerometer-based sleep classification has shown an impressive

ability to detect and monitor sleep behavior across taxa (Ancoli-Israel et al., 2003; de Souza et al., 
130 
2003; Hoffmann et al., 2012; Ladha & Hoffman, 2018; Malungo et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2020), and is 
131 
now commonly used to assess sleep in both humans (e.g. Jones et al., 2019; Patel et al., 2017) and 
132 
non-human animals (e.g. Gravett et al., 2017; Reinhardt, 2020; Samson et al., 2018). Validation 
133 
studies comparing performance of this non-invasive method to polysomnogaphy—the gold standard 
134 
in sleep research—generally show high accuracy (78-90%; Ancoli-Israel et al., 2003; Kanady et al., 
135 
2011; Malungo et al., 2021; Shambroom et al., 2012), although concerns remain about the ability of 
136 
movement-based methods to distinguish sleep from resting wakefulness (Ancoli-Israel et al., 2003; de 
137 
Souza et al., 2003), and results must be evaluated with these caveats in mind. For this study, we 
138 
adapted a well-validated sleep classification algorithm used in human research (van Hees et al., 2015; 
139 
van Hees et al., 2018) and validated its ability to detect sleep in wild baboons. We then used this 
140 
algorithm to describe the sleep patterns of members of our study group over a period of a month 
141 
(Table S1). We used these data to assess the influence of homeostatic regulation on the pattern of 
142 
sleep and wake bouts within nights, as well as the duration of sleep across nights. We compared this 
143 
influence to that of the location in which individuals slept (both within the sleep site as well as 
144 
between distinct sleep sites) and their local social environment, both of which may exert pressures on 
145 
sleep behavior in the wild that conflict with the maintenance of homeostasis. 
146 
Results 
147 
The diel pattern of activity in wild baboons, as reflected by accelerometry data, reveals a clear 
148 
monophasic sleep pattern, with individuals active during the day and inactive at night (Fig. 1B). To 
149 
derive metrics of sleep (sleep onset time, awakening time, total sleep time, sleep period duration, 
150 
sleep efficiency), we calculated the log of the vectorial dynamic body acceleration (VeDBA), a 
151 
widely-used measure of overall movement activity (Qasem et al., 2012), from 36 calendar days or 354 
152 
baboon-nights. Sleep onset occurred 53.0 ± 1.7 (mean ± SE) minutes prior to the end of evening 
153 
astronomical twilight, and baboons awoke 35.9 ± 1.7 minutes after the beginning of morning 
154 
astronomical twilight (Fig. 1A,C). The duration of the sleep period – the period between sleep onset 
155 
and awakening – was 11.0 ± 0.04 hours on average. Within the sleep period, baboons slept for an 
156 
average of 9.2 ± 0.04 hours (total sleep time), displaying an average sleep efficiency of 85.0% ± 
157 
0.2%. 
158 
[Figure 1] 
159 
Due to high correlation of total sleep time with onset time, awakening time, sleep period 
160 
duration, and sleep efficiency (Table S2), we focused the majority of our analyses on total sleep time. 
161 
Individuals differed in their total sleep time, and much of this variation reflected differences between 
162 
the sexes and variation across age categories. Males slept an average of 20 minutes longer than 
163 
females (Linear Mixed Model (LMM): standardized estimate [95% credible interval lower bound, 
164 
95% credible interval upper bound]: 0.44 [-0.04, 0.92]), while juveniles and subadults slept, on

average, 15 minutes less than adults (LMM: juveniles: -0.32 [-1.12, 0.50]; subadults: -0.32 [-0.80, 
166 
0.14]). 
167 
The maintenance of homeostasis was not a strong driver of sleep patterns (Fig. 2). After 
168 
sleeping poorly (low total sleep time), baboons did not ‘catch up’ by napping more on the following 
169 
day (Table S6; LMM: 0.05 [-0.08, 0.18]) or sleeping longer the following night (Fig. 2A; LMM: 0.00 
170 
[-0.14, 0.13]). However, baboons did sleep less following days on which they spent more time 
171 
napping (Fig. 2B; LMM: -0.18 [-0.36, -0.01]). For every minute spent napping, baboons spent 0.6 
172 
fewer minutes sleeping the following night. Baboons’ sleep duration was uninfluenced by their 
173 
physical exertion during the day, as measured by either the distance they traveled (Fig. 2C; LMM: -
174 
0.02 [-0.18, 0.15],) or their cumulative daytime VeDBA (Table S5; LMM: -0.12 [-0.33, 0.12]). In 
175 
humans, homeostatic regulation of sleep manifests within, as well as between nights: sleep wanes and 
176 
wakeful activity increases over the course of the sleep period as individuals gradually fulfill their 
177 
sleep requirements (Winnebeck et al, 2018). Baboons, in contrast, did not experience this increase in 
178 
wakefulness as the night progressed, despite exhibiting cyclic sleep patterns that are otherwise similar 
179 
to patterns of human sleep (Fig. 2D; GAMM: r2adj = 0.008, F(8.741) = 89.16, p < 1x10-15).  
180 
[Figure 2] 
181 
The location where baboons slept had a strong influence on sleep duration, with individuals 
182 
sleeping less when spending the night in less familiar locations. For the first 21 nights of the study, 
183 
group members slept at the same site, distributed across ten adjacent yellow fever (Acacia 
184 
xanthophloea) trees (Fig. 3A). Individuals showed high fidelity to particular sleep trees (Fig. S3; one-
185 
tailed two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test: p < 1.0 x 10-9), returning each night to one or a small set 
186 
of the available trees populated by the group. Not only did the choice of tree itself influence sleep 
187 
duration (Table S3 – S4, Fig. S4), but the individual’s familiarity with their selected tree impacted 
188 
how much they slept. Baboons slept longer in trees to which they showed higher fidelity (Fig. 3C; 
189 
LMM: 0.20 [0.05, 0.36]), with individuals sleeping up to 33.3 minutes longer in the tree to which they 
190 
showed highest fidelity than in the tree to which they showed lowest fidelity. Following a failed 
191 
leopard attack on the 21st night of the study, the group moved to a less commonly used sleep site 1.5 
192 
km away (Fig. 3B). They remained at this sleep site for three nights before returning to sleep at their 
193 
main sleep site. While the baboons showed no substantial decrease in their sleep duration on the night 
194 
of the leopard attack (Fig. 3D, Fig. S7; LMM: -0.25 [-0.87, 0.39]), they slept 72 minutes less, on 
195 
average, upon moving to the less familiar sleep site (Fig. 3D, Fig. S7; LMM: -1.55 [-2.18, -0.91]). 
196 
This decrease in total sleep time following the change in sites was limited to the first night in the new 
197 
sleep site, after which sleep durations returned to normal (Fig. 3D; Fig. S7). 
198 
[Figure 3] 
199 
Sleeping in a social context also impacted sleep duration, as group-mates disrupted each 
200 
other’s rest during the night. Contrary to predictions of the sentinel hypothesis, the proportion of the 
201 
night in which at least one individual was awake was significantly less than expected by chance (Fig. 
202

4A; Fisher’s exact test: p < 0.0001), suggesting that, rather than staggering periods of nocturnal 
203 
wakefulness, group-mates were actually synchronized in their sleep-wake patterns throughout the 
204 
night. Confirming this synchronization, we found that a significantly greater proportion of the group 
205 
exhibited the same simultaneous behavior, either being asleep or awake, than expected (Fig. 4B; 
206 
Fisher’s exact test: p < 0.0001). Group members showed a unique pattern of synchronized sleep and 
207 
wake bouts each night, and thus, synchronization was not a spurious result of a stereotyped schedule 
208 
of activity that happened to be consistent across baboons and across nights (Fig. S10; Fisher’s exact 
209 
test: p < 0.0001). Moreover, pairs of baboons showed more synchronization when sleeping in the 
210 
same tree than when sleeping in different trees (Fig. 4C; LMM: 0.56 [0.47 – 0.64]), which suggested 
211 
that sleeping individuals may awaken in response to the activity of group-mates in their local 
212 
environment, or that external disruptions in the local environment may simultaneously waken all 
213 
group members in the vicinity. To distinguish between these potential explanations, we tested the 
214 
influence of the number of group-mates in an individual’s local environment on their total sleep time, 
215 
and found that individuals slept less when sharing their sleeping tree with more group-mates (Fig. 4D; 
216 
LMM: -0.51 [-0.85, -0.16]). Each additional tracked group-mate in a tree resulted in a 4.0-minute 
217 
decrease in total sleep time. Taken together, these results indicate that synchronization resulted from 
218 
social disruptions of sleep.  
219 
[Figure 4] 
220 
We found no influence of moon phase or the minimum ambient temperature during the night 
221 
on baboon sleep duration (LMM: Moon phase: 0.05 [-0.12, 0.22]; Temperature: -0.03 [-0.21, 0.13]). 
222 
Discussion 
223 
In this study, we demonstrate that the ecological and social demands that animals experience 
224 
in the natural world disrupt the widely-reported homeostatic regulation of sleep. We show that while 
225 
baboons sleep less in unfamiliar environments and their sleep is disrupted by the activity of group-
226 
mates, their recent history of sleep and physical exertion has only a limited role in influencing sleep 
227 
behavior. Because baboons are highly vulnerable to nocturnal predation (Busse, 1980; Cheney et al., 
228 
2004; Isbell et al., 2018) and because they experience fitness benefits from maintaining strong social 
229 
bonds (Silk et al., 2009), sacrificing sleep to maintain alertness in novel environments and to remain 
230 
close to group-mates may represent critical adaptations. Our results highlight the tradeoffs that group-
231 
living animals navigate when investing in sleep in the wild, and in doing so, challenge the centrality 
232 
of the role that homeostasis has played in shaping sleep patterns in the environment in which sleep 
233 
evolved. Decades of research in the laboratory and at the bedside have implicated homeostatic 
234 
regulation as a key driver of sleep patterns, with the sleep rebound that follows periods of deficit 
235 
facilitating the maintenance of a physiologically required amount of sleep (Amlaner et al., 2009). 
236 
However, sleep studies have traditionally investigated sleep in highly controlled environments, where 
237 
the costs of investing in sleep are largely absent. Our findings suggest that, in the natural world,

“sleep need” may be a relatively flexible concept, with variation in sleep investment driven as much 
239 
by the opportunity costs of sleep as by its physiological benefits. 
240 
There are substantial opportunity costs of devoting a significant portion of every day to 
241 
sleeping. Sleeping animals are highly vulnerable to predation (Lima et al., 2005), and our results 
242 
suggest that individuals sleep less when the risk of predation is particularly high. Baboon group 
243 
members showed high fidelity to particular locations within their main sleep site, and individuals 
244 
sacrificed sleep both when sleeping in trees to which they did not show high fidelity as well as upon 
245 
moving to a new, less familiar sleep site following a leopard attack. Given that predation risk tends to 
246 
be greater in unfamiliar locations (Forrester et al., 2015; Gehr et al., 2020; Yoder et al., 2004), 
247 
baboons appear to trade sleep for vigilance according to the current risk of predation. Notably, 
248 
however, we did not find that baboons decreased their investment in sleep on the night of leopard 
249 
attack. This surprising result may reflect leopards’ disinclination, as stealth hunters, to launch 
250 
repeated attacks (Hayward et al., 2006; Lin et al., 2020), or indicate that baboons perceive uncertainty 
251 
in the level of risk as potentially more dangerous than a confirmed threat.  
252 
Engaging in sleep precludes investment in a variety of behaviors, in addition to anti-predator 
253 
vigilance, that are important to fitness (Aulsebrook et al., 2016; Lesku et al., 2012; Lima et al., 2005; 
254 
Roth et al., 2010). Consistent with our results, recent studies in ecologically-relevant contexts have 
255 
revealed that animals forego sleep when ecological demands increase the associated opportunity costs. 
256 
For example, while engaging in long, non-stop flights, great frigatebirds reduced the amount they 
257 
slept by 92.7%, without apparent physiological consequences (Rattenborg et al., 2016). Similarly, 
258 
northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) experience extended suppression of rapid eye movement 
259 
(REM) sleep – also shown in the laboratory to be homeostatically regulated (Dement, 1960; 
260 
Shiromani et al., 2000) – when they migrate in the open ocean for several months (Lyamin et al., 
261 
2018). Moreover, the seals do not experience a rebound in their REM sleep following this period of 
262 
deficit (Lyamin et al., 2018). Male pectoral sandpipers greatly reduce their time spent sleeping during 
263 
their short and intense mating season, and males that slept less actually experienced higher 
264 
reproductive success (Lesku et al., 2012). Thus, across contexts and taxa, ecological pressures appear 
265 
to supersede the maintenance of sleep homeostasis in the wild. 
266 
Recent technological advances allowing for the use of polysomnography – the gold standard 
267 
for recording sleep – have played an important role in revealing the ecological tradeoffs that wild 
268 
animals face when navigating decisions about when, where, and how to sleep (Davimes et al., 2018; 
269 
Lesku et al., 2011, 2012; Rattenborg et al., 2008, 2016; Scriba et al., 2013; Voirin et al., 2014). 
270 
Although these advances hold great promise for wider application in the future, the invasive nature of 
271 
polysomnography unfortunately limits its current use to taxa whose daily activities do not interfere 
272 
with electrodes implanted either subdermally or inter-cranially. Because baboons are highly dexterous 
273 
and engage in frequent allogrooming, we were unable to apply this gold standard, and instead, 
274 
resorted to an alternate method in order to ask and answer important questions about the ecology of

sleep in a wild social primate. Accelerometer-based sleep classification – a tool already used to 
276 
investigate sleep across terrestrial (human: Jones et al., 2019; Patel et al., 2017; non-human: Bäckman 
277 
et al., 2017; Davimes et al., 2018; Gravett et al., 2017; Lesku et al., 2011; Malungo et al., 2021; Qin et 
278 
al., 2020; Reinhardt et al., 2019; Reyes et al., 2021; Samson et al., 2018; Sellers & Crompton, 2004; 
279 
Sri Kantha & Suzuki, 2006; Suzuki et al., 2018) and marine taxa (Miller et al., 2008; Mitani et al., 
280 
2010; Wright et al., 2017) – offered a valid alternative to polysomnography. We note that the use of 
281 
accelerometry can introduce biases in sleep monitoring, typically by overestimating total sleep time as 
282 
a result of an inability to distinguish resting wakefulness from sleep (Ancoli-Israel et al., 2003; de 
283 
Souza et al., 2003). However, if these biases are considered during the interpretation of results, the use 
284 
of accelerometry to investigate sleep provides an immediate opportunity to shed light on how diverse 
285 
species balance their physiological sleep requirements with ecological opportunity costs that vary 
286 
according to natural history, trophic level, community composition, climate, and local environment. 
287 
Further, the relative ease of accelerometer deployment, and its prevalence in ecological research, 
288 
changes the scale at which sleep behavior can be studied, enabling the simultaneous and long-term 
289 
monitoring of sleep at the population level. This rescaling of sleep research creates many new 
290 
opportunities, one of which is the ability to record sleep in the majority of social group members and 
291 
thus explore an exciting new scientific frontier: the collective dynamics of sleep. 
292 
Using accelerometry to track the sleep patterns of nearly an entire group of wild baboons, we 
293 
demonstrated the importance of the social environment in shaping the sleep patterns of group-living 
294 
animals. Contrary to the predictions of the sentinel hypothesis (Samson et al., 2017; Snyder, 1966), 
295 
periods of nocturnal wakefulness of group members were not staggered, but rather synchronized, 
296 
particularly with nearby group-mates. Baboons also slept less when in close proximity to a greater 
297 
number of group-mates. Taken together, these results suggest that group-mates disrupt each other’s 
298 
sleep. Social disruptions may result from group-mates actively interacting with each other during the 
299 
night. Gregarious animals often invest substantially in building and maintaining social relationships 
300 
with their group-mates (Ward & Webster, 2016), and these bonds can prove essential to their fitness 
301 
(Cameron et al., 2009; Campos et al., 2020; Frère et al., 2010; Riehl & Strong, 2018; Silk et al., 
302 
2009). Because animals have limited time to devote to maintaining their social bonds during the day 
303 
(Dunbar, 1992), they may actively sacrifice sleep in order to invest in these relationships at night. 
304 
Alternatively, social animals may wake in response to the periodic waking and repositioning of their 
305 
group-mates during the night, and thus, socially-disrupted sleep may be an inherent by-product of 
306 
sleeping in a group. Simply remaining in a cohesive group may therefore present a challenge to 
307 
obtaining sufficient sleep.  
308 
Social animals may jeopardize sleep homeostasis to maintain cohesion with their conspecifics 
309 
because remaining in close proximity to their group-mates during the sleep period could prove 
310 
essential to their fitness. Individuals likely benefit from the dilution of predation risk that is achieved 
311 
through group cohesion, particularly when they are sleeping and thus highly vulnerable to predators

(Lehtonen & Jaatinen, 2016). Collective vigilance may also reduce the risk of predation for group 
313 
members. Even in the absence of collective vigilance optimization via non-randomly staggered 
314 
wakefulness, the proportion of the night with at least one group member awake is still likely to be 
315 
substantially greater than any particular individual’s investment in vigilance. In our study, at least one 
316 
individual in the group was awake for 394 ± 11 minutes (82% ± 2%) from 21:00 to 05:00, although 
317 
each individual was only awake for 79 ± 1 minutes (16% ± 0.2%) of the same period. Samson and 
318 
colleagues (2017) found high levels of collective vigilance during the night in a group of Hadza 
319 
hunter-gatherers, and they suggest that this collective vigilance may facilitate higher intensity sleep 
320 
(Samson & Nunn, 2015). Because accelerometry cannot measure sleep intensity, we were unable to 
321 
test whether collective vigilance allowed individuals sleeping close to group-mates to experience 
322 
more intense, albeit shorter, sleep. Future studies leveraging advances in polysomnography (i.e. EEG) 
323 
that may eventually allow its application in wild social animals could enable a test of this possibility. 
324 
Unexpectedly, we found that adult baboons slept longer than subadults and juveniles, and 
325 
males slept longer than females. This contrasts with previous research that found age differences in 
326 
sleep patterns linked to physiological demands during the development of the central nervous system 
327 
(Amlaner et al., 2009) and sex differences in sleep tied to the influence of sex steroids (Mong & 
328 
Cusmano, 2016), with younger individuals sleeping more than older individuals (Knutson, 2014; 
329 
Ohayon et al., 2004; Olds et al., 2010; Steinmeyer et al., 2010; Stuber et al., 2015) and females 
330 
sleeping more than males in birds and humans (Lendrem, 1983; Mong & Cusmano, 2016; Roehrs et 
331 
al., 2006; Steinmeyer et al., 2010; Stuber et al., 2015). Our surprising results here may be an artefact 
332 
of the tendency of accelerometer-based sleep monitoring to classify resting wakefulness as sleep 
333 
(Table S12; Ancoli-Israel et al., 2003; de Souza et al., 2003). Older individuals may rest quietly when 
334 
waking during the night, thus falsely determined to be asleep according to their accelerometry, 
335 
whereas younger individuals may be more likely to resume activity upon waking. However, if these 
336 
findings are not the result of a bias in our sleep recording technique,  they may reflect variation in the 
337 
vulnerability to predation among the age-sex classes in this highly sexually dimorphic species 
338 
(Cheney et al., 2004), with young and female baboons likely realizing a higher cost of sleep than adult 
339 
males. Individuals may also differ in their sleep patterns due to their ability to gain access to a high-
340 
quality sleep location within the group’s sleep site. Our results have demonstrated the importance of 
341 
location to sleep duration. However, group-mates may differ in their access to preferred sleep 
342 
locations, particularly if preferred locations are limited. Baboon groups are structured by linear 
343 
dominance hierarchies that shape the priority of access to resources (Cheney & Seyfarth, 2008; King 
344 
et al., 2009; Marshall et al., 2015), and individuals can leverage their affiliative and kinship 
345 
relationships to obtain resources that they would not be able to access based on social rank alone (Sick 
346 
et al., 2014). Further research is needed to investigate the extent to which these complex social 
347 
dynamics influence an individual’s ability to obtain a preferred sleep location and, thus, a good 
348 
night’s sleep.

In addition to highlighting social dynamics as a key driver of sleep patterns in group-living 
350 
species, our study provides important insights into selective pressures that may have shaped the 
351 
evolution of human sleep. The physiological requirements for sleep and the homeostatic mechanisms 
352 
that ensure this requirement is fulfilled have long been assumed to be the key drivers influencing the 
353 
way that our sleep has evolved and the characteristics of our sleep today. However, we suggest that 
354 
the criticality of homeostatic control in shaping our sleep patterns could be an artefact of sleeping in 
355 
an environment devoid of the ecological and social costs that sleep would have presented our 
356 
ancestors. Evidence suggests that, like baboons, early hominins were extremely vulnerable to 
357 
nighttime predation in their dry savannah habitats (Brain, 1983; Treves & Palmqvist, 2007; 
358 
Wrangham & Carmody, 2010). Hominins likely remained vulnerable to nocturnal predation until they 
359 
began to manipulate fire, around which they could sleep to reduce the risk of predation (Samson & 
360 
Nunn, 2015), and some characteristics of our sleep today may be best explained in light of the 
361 
vulnerability that sleep imparted on our ancestors. For example, modern humans exhibit decreased 
362 
sleep quality when sleeping in an unfamiliar environment (Tamaki et al., 2016), similar to the 
363 
baboons in our study. The lower quality sleep resulting from this aptly named “first night effect” is 
364 
limited to the first night in a new location (Tamaki et al., 2016), and our findings suggest that the first 
365 
night effect may be conserved from an environment where this first night would have been 
366 
accompanied by poor information about risk and thus, a higher likelihood of predation. Early 
367 
hominins would have also experienced a social opportunity cost of sleep, as they likely slept in groups 
368 
(Samson & Nunn, 2015; Willems & van Schaik, 2017) and would have experienced constraints on the 
369 
time available to maintain their social network during the day, until developing the advanced 
370 
cognition that enabled a more efficient use of time (Nunn & Samson, 2018; Samson & Nunn, 2015). 
371 
While our sleep has likely evolved substantially from that of our earliest ancestors, with modern 
372 
human sleep being extremely short and intense compared to that of other primates (Nunn et al., 2016; 
373 
Nunn & Samson, 2018), a full understanding of the way we sleep involves considering not only the 
374 
physiological benefits of sleep, but also its ecological and social costs in the environment in which it 
375 
evolved.  
376 
Materials and Methods 
377 
Data collection 
378 
We monitored sleep and activity patterns in a group of olive baboons at Mpala Research 
379 
Centre (MRC), a 200 km2 conservancy located on the Laikipia Plateau in central Kenya. We trapped 
380 
and anesthetized 26 individuals, which comprised more than 80% of the adults and subadults in the 
381 
study group (see Strandburg-Peshkin et al., 2015 for details on capture methodology). Upon capture, 
382 
we noted the age class and sex of each baboon, as well as whether the baboon was lactating. We fit 
383 
each individual with a GPS and accelerometry collar that recorded the baboon’s GPS location at 1 Hz 
384 
sampling interval and continuous tri-axial accelerations at 12 Hz/axis from 06:00 to18:00. From 18:00 
385 
to 06:00, the collars recorded a 2.5-second burst of accelerations at 10 Hz/axis at the beginning of

every minute. The collars were programmed to collect data from August 1, 2012 to September 6, 
387 
2012, but due to a programming glitch, several collars stopped collecting data prematurely (Table S1). 
388 
In total, we collected 483 days of GPS data, and 506 nights of accelerometry data. We also collected 
389 
high-resolution drone imagery of the group’s most commonly used sleep site (see Strandburg-Peshkin 
390 
et al., 2017 for details). 
391 
Sleep Analysis 
392 
We used the accelerometry data to classify sleep behavior by adapting a method presented in 
393 
van Hees et al. 2018 that was developed for extracting metrics of sleep in humans from wearable 
394 
accelerometry devices. The process of determining the sleep period, defined as the period from sleep 
395 
onset to waking, is summarized in Fig. 5. 
396 
To uniformize the accelerometry sampling schedule, we down-sampled and interpolated the 
397 
daytime accelerometry data such that it matched the 10 Hz bursts of accelerometry collected during 
398 
the night. We calculated the vectorial dynamic body acceleration (VeDBA) using a 0.7-second time-
399 
window and generated the log of the average VeDBA for the 2.5-second burst each minute. We then 
400 
calculated a rolling median of the log VeDBA with a 9-minute window. Following van Hees et al. 
401 
2018, continuous periods of at least 30 minutes during which the rolling median of the log VeDBA 
402 
was less than the 10th percentile of the log VeDBA multiplied by 1.125 were considered sleep blocks. 
403 
Any blocks within 45 minutes of each other were merged into sleep periods. If this resulted in more 
404 
than one sleep period, the longest sleep period in the day, defined as a noon-to-noon period, was 
405 
considered the sleep period. The beginning and end of the sleep period represents the time of sleep 
406 
onset and waking, respectively. Of the 506 baboon-nights of accelerometry data, we successfully 
407 
calculated the sleep period for 491 baboon-nights. 
408 
 
409 
[Figure 5] 
410 
Adapting the method developed by van Hees and colleagues (2015), we classified each 
411 
minute epoch both within and outside of the sleep period as representing either sleep or waking 
412 
behavior. As above, the 10th percentile of the log VeDBA multiplied by 1.125 served as the 
413 
classification threshold, and we classified epochs as indicating sleep when the log VeDBA for at least 
414 
three consecutive epochs was below the log VeDBA threshold value. We classified all other epochs as 
415 
representing waking behavior. Consistent with previous sleep analyses, we measured total sleep time 
416 
as the total number of minutes of sleep epochs during the sleep period. We measured sleep efficiency 
417 
as the total sleep time divided by the duration of the sleep period. We measured sleep time during the 
418 
day – time spent napping – as the number of minutes of sleep epochs from 07:30 to 17:30, as these 
419 
times were reliably within the waking period (Fig. 1C), and using standardized times prevented a 
420 
spurious negative correlation between time spent sleeping during the waking period and total sleep 
421 
time during the sleep period that would result from the waking period prior to or following short sleep 
422 
periods having a greater number of potential epochs that could be considered sleep.

The accelerometer units occasionally failed to collect data according to their programmed 
424 
sampling schedule. Because insufficient data in a given day would prevent a reliable calculation of the 
425 
threshold value for the sleep classification and produce variability in the number of potential sleep 
426 
epochs, we did not include data for total sleep time, sleep onset time, waking time, or napping time 
427 
(both on the prior day and following day) from noon-to-noon periods missing at least 120 (8.3%) 
428 
accelerometry bursts, which decreased the number of baboon-nights from 491 to 368. We further 
429 
removed data for total sleep time, onset time, and waking time from noon-to-noon periods missing at 
430 
least 20 consecutive accelerometry bursts, as the determination of the sleep period is sensitive to gaps 
431 
between consecutive accelerometry bursts, resulting in a final number of 354 sleep periods analyzed. 
432 
We did not remove data for napping time on these days because measuring napping time did not 
433 
depend on the determination of the sleep period. 
434 
Validation of sleep classification algorithm 
435 
The algorithm from which the sleep classification technique is adapted is well-validated using 
436 
polysomnography (C-statistic = 0.83 – 0.86) to both classify sleep behavior and determine the sleep 
437 
period in humans (van Hees et al., 2015, 2018). Although the classification of sleep in non-human 
438 
primates using devices and algorithms that were validated with polysomnography only in humans has 
439 
become a common practice in sleep research (Barrett et al., 2009; Brutcher & Nader, 2013; Reinhardt 
440 
et al., 2019; Reyes et al., 2021; Samson et al., 2018; Sri Kantha & Suzuki, 2006; Zhdanova et al., 
441 
2002), we returned to the study site in July 2019 to validate the accelerometer-based sleep 
442 
classification. Because logistical and ethical limitations prevent the use of polysomnography in free-
443 
ranging, highly dexterous animals, we compared the accelerometer-based sleep classification to direct 
444 
observations of wakeful and sleeping baboons fit with accelerometer collars for validation, as 
445 
suggested by Rattenborg and colleagues (2017). Behavioral observations were facilitated by high-
446 
resolution thermal imagery (FLIR T1020, FLIR Systems Inc., Wilsonville, OR, USA). The validation 
447 
study determined that our accelerometry-based classification of sleep exhibits a 79.9% accuracy 
448 
(Table S12; see Supplemental Information for further details of validation study). 
449 
Physical activity 
450 
Using the GPS data, we calculated each individual’s daily travel distance. To avoid 
451 
accumulation of GPS positional error overestimating the actual daily travel distance, we calculated 
452 
daily travel distance only after discretizing the GPS data to 5-meter resolution (Strandburg-Peshkin et 
453 
al., 2017). We removed travel distance data on days on which a baboon’s GPS collar first began 
454 
taking fixes later than 07:30 or took its last fix before 17:00. Between these times, the group was often 
455 
on the move, and thus delayed onset and premature offset of GPS devices that infringed upon this 
456 
period would likely underestimate travel distances. We further removed one individual’s data from 
457 
the first half of the study due to a temporary collar malorientation that resulted in exaggerated GPS 
458 
error.

We also calculated cumulative activity during the day from the accelerometry data. Using the 
460 
continuous 12 Hz accelerometry data, we calculated VeDBA from 06:00 to 18:00 using a 0.5 second 
461 
time window, averaged VeDBA over each minute, and then summed these values to generate a 
462 
cumulative measure of activity during the day. 
463 
Sleep location characterization and fidelity 
464 
Visualization of the GPS data indicated that individuals remained reliably stationary until at 
465 
least 06:15 every day, and thus we determined the location in which each baboon slept from the 
466 
median of the first 10 GPS locations that occurred before 06:15. If an individual’s GPS collar did not 
467 
successfully collect 10 locations before 06:15, its data on this day were excluded from analyses 
468 
involving sleep location. This resulted in the removal of 9/483 baboon-days of data. In ArcGIS, drone 
469 
imagery was used to trace the crowns of distinct sleep trees within the group’s main sleep site. We 
470 
determined that an individual slept in a particular tree if its sleep location was within the traced 
471 
polygon of that tree crown. Sleep locations that fell outside the crown of a tree, likely reflecting minor 
472 
error in the GPS location estimates, were assigned to the closest sleeping tree. Only 32/469 sleep 
473 
locations (6.8%) had to be assigned to a sleep tree in this manner. In rare cases where an individual’s 
474 
sleep location was greater than 10 m from the crown of the closest sleep tree (5/474 cases – 1.1% of 
475 
baboon-days), its data on this day were excluded from analysis. 
476 
Analysis of the sleep location data revealed that, over the course of the study, the baboons 
477 
slept in two distinct sleep sites that were separated by approximately 1.5 km. The group slept at their 
478 
main sleep site for the first 21 nights of the study, and then spent three nights in a different sleep site 
479 
after a failed leopard attack on the 21st study night. The group then returned to the main site for the 
480 
duration of the study. In total, they spent 32/35 (91.4%) nights at their main site and 3/35 (8.6%) 
481 
nights at the alternate sleep site. While the entire group slept in a single tree at the less frequently used 
482 
sleep site, the group’s main sleep site contained 10 trees across which the group slept. We performed 
483 
a permutation test to investigate whether individuals exhibited consistency in the tree in which they 
484 
chose to sleep. We calculated the Shannon entropy of each individual’s sleep tree usage, and we 
485 
compared these Shannon entropies to those produced from each of 1000 random exchanges of the 
486 
locations of individuals on each night. Permuted values provide a null distribution controlling for 
487 
potential sleep tree usage, as the distribution of individuals across the sleep trees each night from the 
488 
empirical data was maintained in the permuted data. Shannon entropy is a measure of the uncertainty 
489 
of a random variable, and is given by the equation: 
490 
𝐻(𝑋) = −∑𝑝(𝑥)𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑝(𝑥))
𝑋=𝑥
 
491 
Thus, a lower Shannon entropy in the empirical data compared to the permuted data in this context 
492 
would signal sleep tree fidelity, with an individual sleeping more often in certain trees and less often 
493 
in other trees than expected by chance. To determine whether the baboons exhibited significant sleep 
494 
tree fidelity, we compared the distribution of the group’s empirical entropies to the distribution of 
495

entropies produced from the permutations with a one-tailed two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. 
496 
As determining fidelity requires several nights of data, we did not include entropy values, either 
497 
empirical or permuted, from individuals with less than four nights of data. We also limited this 
498 
analysis of tree fidelity to the first 15 days of data, as the number of individuals on which we have 
499 
data decreases sharply after this day (Table S1), which decreases the possible permutations. 
500 
 
After determining that individuals showed non-random sleep tree selection (see Results), we 
501 
then calculated an individual-specific fidelity index for each tree. This fidelity index was measured as 
502 
the average number of nights an individual slept in a particular tree in the 1000 permutations 
503 
subtracted from the number of nights the individual actually slept in that particular tree. Again, we did 
504 
not calculate fidelity indices for individuals with less than four nights of data. 
505 
Pattern of sleep-wake behavior across the group 
506 
 
We tested whether individuals staggered their periods of nocturnal wakefulness or, 
507 
conversely, synchronized them beyond the level expected by chance. For this analysis, we subset the 
508 
data to times between 21:00 and 05:00, as these times consistently fell within the bounds of the sleep 
509 
period of all individuals. We calculated the proportion of minute epochs across all nights in which at 
510 
least one group member was awake and the proportion of the group that was synchronized in their 
511 
behavior (either sleep or wakefulness) during each minute epoch, averaging across all epochs. We 
512 
then calculated these same proportions, but after applying a random time shift to each individual’s 
513 
time series of sleep-wake epochs on each night (Fig. S9). We repeated this procedure 1000 times to 
514 
develop a null distribution of the proportion of epochs during the night in which at least one 
515 
individual is awake and a null distribution of the average proportion of the group that was 
516 
synchronized, and we compared the empirical proportions to their respective null distributions 
517 
statistically with a Fisher’s exact test. The p-value thus represents the proportion of time-shifted 
518 
values that were as extreme or more extreme than the empirical value. Shifting the data in time rather 
519 
than permuting it allowed us to develop null distributions while maintaining the autocorrelation 
520 
structure of the data.  
521 
To confirm the robustness of our findings, we again tested for collective vigilance and 
522 
synchronization, comparing the empirical values defined above to null distributions produced using an 
523 
alternative method. In this method, rather than applying a random time shift to each night of each 
524 
individual’s data, we maintained the real time associated with the time series data, but we permuted 
525 
the night associated with each time series (Fig. S10). We compared empirical values to the null 
526 
distributions created by these night permutations with a Fisher’s exact test. 
527 
Statistical analysis of sleep 
528 
 
Data were processed using the statistical analysis software R version 4.0.5 (R Core Team, 
529 
2021). We only included the first 20 study nights in the analyses of sleep, except where specified, due 
530 
to concerns that the leopard attack that occurred on the 21st night could potentially disrupt typical 
531 
sleep patterns. To compare the effects of various physiological, ecological, and social predictors of

sleep, we modeled total sleep time with a Bayesian linear mixed model (LMM), with random effects 
533 
of individual identity and night, and fixed effects of age, sex, distance traveled in the preceding day, 
534 
napping time during the preceding day, relative time spent sleeping the previous night, the identity of 
535 
the sleep tree, fidelity index for the current sleep tree, the relative number of individuals in the sleep 
536 
tree, the phase of the moon, and minimum ambient temperature during the night. We created a 
537 
separate model that included cumulative VeDBA instead of distance travelled because cumulative 
538 
daytime VeDBA was highly correlated with distance travelled during the day. An individual’s relative 
539 
time spent sleeping the previous night was measured as the difference between its total sleep time on 
540 
the previous night and its average total sleep time. This relative measure controlled for positive 
541 
correlations between total sleep time on previous night and current night total sleep time that would 
542 
result purely from among-individual variation in total sleep time – a scenario that would not be 
543 
sufficiently controlled for by the individual identity random effect in this model. We calculated the 
544 
relative number of individuals in the sleep tree by dividing the number of individuals in the sleep tree 
545 
by the total number of individuals who were successfully assigned to a sleep tree on that given night, 
546 
to control for the decrease in the number of individuals in each sleep tree over the course of the study 
547 
that resulted from premature termination of data collection in several collars. Moon phase was a 
548 
continuous variable realizing values from 0 to 1 (with 0 representing a new moon, and 1 representing 
549 
a full moon), and we collected this data for the days of the study using the sunCalc package in R 
550 
(Benoit & Elmarhraoui, 2019). The minimum ambient temperature represented the minimum 
551 
temperature at the sleep site during the night, determined using interpolated ECMWF air temperature 
552 
(2 m above ground) data obtained with the Env-DATA functionality (Dodge et al., 2013) provided on 
553 
Movebank data repository (www.movebank.org). We standardized all response and predictor 
554 
variables to allow for comparison of effect sizes among variables. To increase the interpretability of 
555 
the total sleep time model, we reran the model without standardized variables. Effect sizes reported in 
556 
the main text are derived from the standardized model, whereas figures produced in the main text, as 
557 
well as the interpretation of the effect of each variable on the unstandardized sleep time are derived 
558 
from the model with unstandardized variables. 
559 
 
To examine the effect of the leopard attack and subsequent sleep site change on sleep 
560 
parameters, we modeled the effect of particular nights on sleep parameters with a Bayesian LMM. 
561 
Specifically, we divided data into the following categories: all nights before the leopard attack, the 
562 
night of the leopard attack, the first night in the new sleep site (i.e. the night following the leopard 
563 
attack), the second night in the new sleep site, the third night in the new sleep site, and the remainder 
564 
of study nights, during which the group slept in its main sleep site. Aside from this categorical night 
565 
variable, we also included age, sex, distance traveled in the preceding day, napping time during the 
566 
preceding day, relative time spent sleeping the previous night, the phase of the moon, and minimum 
567 
ambient temperature as fixed effects in the models with random intercepts for individual identity. In

these models, we did not include sleep tree identity, number of individuals in the sleep tree, and sleep 
569 
tree fidelity score, as the entire group slept in a single tree in the less commonly used sleep site. 
570 
 
We further tested for the effect of prior sleep debt on sleep behavior by modeling the effect of 
571 
total sleep time on time spent napping the following day. We modeled this relationship with a 
572 
Bayesian LMM, using individual identity and day as random intercepts. We also assessed how the 
573 
likelihood of sleep progressed through the night. We used a generalized additive mixed model 
574 
(GAMM) to model the log-odds of a baboon being asleep in a given epoch as a function of the 
575 
duration of that epoch from the beginning of the sleep period, scaled such that 0 represents the 
576 
beginning of the sleep period and 1 represents the end of the sleep period. We included individual 
577 
identity and night as random intercepts, and to account for autocorrelation in the response variable, we 
578 
also included an AR1 term in the model. 
579 
 
Lastly, we tested whether individuals showed higher synchronization of their sleep-wake 
580 
patterns when sharing the same sleep tree than when inhabiting different trees. With a Bayesian 
581 
LMM, we modeled the synchronization score between dyads on each night, calculated as the number 
582 
of minutes from 21:00 to 05:00 in which members of the dyad exhibited the same behavior divided by 
583 
the total number minutes in which both individuals had data. We included a binary predictor variable 
584 
indicating whether dyad members were in the same tree as the only fixed effect variable, and night, 
585 
the identity of both individuals in the dyad, as well as the identity of the dyad as random intercept 
586 
variables. 
587 
 
We carried out all Bayesian analyses with the “brms” package in R (Bürkner, 2017). We used 
588 
diffuse, mean-zero Gaussian priors for all predictor variables. Model estimates are based off of four 
589 
independent Hamiltonian Monte Carlo chains with 5000 iterations, 2500 of which were burn-in 
590 
iterations. Trace plots indicated that mixing was sufficient and that the four chains converged on the 
591 
same posterior region. Model estimates reported in the text represent the mean of the posterior 
592 
distribution, along with the lower and upper 95% credible interval bounds from the standardized 
593 
models. We used package “mgcv” in R (Wood, 2011) to fit the GAMM to the sleep epoch data, using 
594 
a thin plate spline smoothing term with 10 knots.

Figure 1. Extracting activity and sleep from accelerometry in a group of wild olive baboons. Adapting 
945 
algorithms developed by van Hees and colleagues (2015, 2018), we used the vectorial dynamic body 
946 
acceleration (VeDBA), a measure of overall activity, to determine the sleep onset and awakening times (A; 
947 
orange dotted lines), as well as periods of wake after sleep onset (A; blue shading) for each individual baboon 
948 
on each day. These metrics allowed us to calculate the total sleep time, sleep period duration, and sleep 
949 
efficiency as well. The plot (A) shows the data of one individual within a single noon-to-noon period as an 
950 
example. Averaged across all individuals on all nights (N = 354 baboons-nights), the log VeDBA shows that 
951 
baboons exhibit activity patterns typical of a diurnal animal with monophasic sleep (B), with a consolidated 
952 
period of very low levels of activity during the night. Although the timing of waking (C; dotted line) was more 
953 
consistent across the group and across the study period than the timing of sleep onset (C; dashed line), both 
954 
sleep onset and waking typically occurred within astronomical twilight. The red shading in (B) indicates ± 1 SE. 
955 
In all subplots, the grey shaded region depicts the period between sunset and sunrise, with double shading from 
956 
the end of astronomical twilight to the beginning of morning astronomical twilight.

Figure 2. Homeostatic regulation has a weak influence on baboon sleep patterns. Neither the relative sleep 
961 
time on the previous night (the difference between an individual’s total sleep time and its average total sleep 
962 
time; A) nor the distance travelled on the preceding day (C) influenced sleep duration, although baboons did 
963 
sleep less following days with more napping (B). Additionally, the likelihood of a baboon being asleep did not 
964 
substantially decrease as the night progressed and the baboon payed off its sleep debt (D). In (D), time since the 
965 
beginning of the sleep period is scaled from 0 (beginning) to 1 (end of the sleep period). Subplots depict 
966 
conditional effects of each variable from models of the data, with raw data points overlaid.

Figure 3. The location where baboons sleep has consequences on sleep duration. Group members spent the 
970 
majority of the study (32/35 nights) sleeping in 10 yellow fever (A. xanthophloea) trees in a grove along the 
971 
Ewaso Ng’iro river (A). Within this sleep site, baboons slept longer when sleeping in trees to which they 
972 
showed high fidelity (C). At 20:30 on the 21st night of the study, a leopard mounted an unsuccessful attack on 
973 
the group in their sleep site. The following day, the baboons moved to a new sleep site 1.5 km away from their 
974 
main sleep site (B). Baboons slept substantially less following this change in sleep site, but this effect did not 
975 
persist beyond the first night in the new location (D). (C) depicts the conditional effects from models of the data,

Figure 4. Collective dynamics within the sleep site influence sleep patterns. Group-mates’ periods of 
982 
nocturnal wakefulness were not staggered, but rather synchronized, as indicated by a significantly lower 
983 
proportion of time with at least one individual awake (A, dotted red line; Fisher’s exact test: p < 0.0001) and a 
984 
significantly greater proportion of the group exhibiting synchronized behaviors (B, dotted red line; Fisher’s 
985 
exact test: p < 0.0001) than expected based on 1000 time-shifted data sets (gray distribution). Synchronized 
986 
sleep patterns likely result from individuals waking in response to the nighttime activity of nearby group-mates, 
987 
as dyads show greater synchronization when dyad members sleep in the same tree compared to when they sleep 
988 
in different trees (C). As a consequence of these local social perturbations, baboons sleep less when sleeping in 
989 
trees with more group-mates (D). Subplots (C) and (D) depict the conditional effects from models of the data, 
990 
with raw data points overlaid.

Each row represents a baboon’s time-series of sleep and wake activity during the night, with black 
1090 
vertical lines indicating periods of nocturnal waking behavior. Colors correspond to different nights, 
1091 
with reference to the empirical, unpermuted data, and the transparency of the color indicates the 
1092 
timing of night. The night permutation procedure was repeated 1000 times to generate a null 
1093 
distribution for the proportion of minutes in which at least one individual is awake during the night 
1094 
and the mean proportion of the group exhibiting synchronized behavior. B) Comparison of the 
1095 
empirical proportion of minutes in which at least one individual is awake (red dotted line) to its null 
1096 
distribution (grey density plot; p < 0.0001). C) Comparison of the empirical mean of the proportion of 
1097 
the group exhibiting synchronized behavior (red dotted line) to its null distribution (grey density plot; 
1098 
p < 0.0001). This method of permutation controls for the possibility that baboons are synchronized in 
1099 
their behavior simply as a result of species-typical nocturnal waking patterns that are consistent across 
1100 
baboons and across nights.

Sleep validation study 
1103 
 
1104 
To evaluate whether the accelerometer-based sleep classification technique was accurately 
1105 
monitoring sleep in baboons, we returned to Mpala Research Centre in July 2019 to perform a 
1106 
validation study in which we compared the results of the accelerometer-based sleep classification to 
1107 
direct observations of awake and sleeping baboons. Using the procedures described in Strandburg-
1108 
Peshkin et al., 2015, we trapped and anesthetized 27 members of a group of habituated olive baboons, 
1109 
fitting each with a GPS and accelerometry collar. Eleven of the 27 collars deployed recorded 
1110 
continuous tri-axial accelerations at 12 Hz/axis from 06:30 to 18:00 and 0.71-second bursts of 
1111 
.

accelerations at 56.2 Hz/axis at the beginning of every minute from 18:00 to 06:30. Accelerometry 
1112 
data was collected by each of these 11 collars for up to 31 days. The remaining 16 collars did not 
1113 
collect accelerometry data from 06:30 to 18:00, and thus we excluded data from these collars from the 
1114 
validation study. 
1115 
We down-sampled and interpolated the accelerometry data such that it matched the sampling 
1116 
frequency and schedule of the data collected in 2012 (i.e. the data analyzed for this manuscript). We 
1117 
then applied the sleep classification algorithm described in the Materials and Methods to this 
1118 
validation dataset. 
1119 
To validate the sleep classification algorithm, we performed direct behavioral observations of 
1120 
the baboons at their primary sleep site. We recorded the behavior of the study baboons starting when 
1121 
they approached their sleep site using a FLIR T1020 high-resolution infrared camera (FLIR Systems 
1122 
Inc., Wilsonville, OR, USA). Recordings continued into the night for as long as the camera battery 
1123 
allowed (average recording duration (range of recording durations): 7.4 hours (1.7 – 14.9 hours)), and 
1124 
we collected thermal imaging data on 21 nights. We identified individuals in the thermal imagery both 
1125 
in real-time, via observer narration of the recorded imagery, and post-recording, by matching 
1126 
movements of individuals in the thermal imagery to the GPS tracks of collared individuals. 
1127 
Following initial data collection, we used the commercial software Loopy (Loopbio GmbH, 
1128 
Austria) to score the behavior of identified individuals in the thermal imagery. Individuals’ behavior 
1129 
was scored as “wakefulness”, “resting wakefulness”, or “sleep”. Wakefulness refers to any behavior 
1130 
involving active movement (i.e. walking, running) or engaged activity (i.e. allogrooming), whereas 
1131 
resting wakefulness refers to behaviors that are dormant (i.e. sitting), but not in the typical sleeping 
1132 
posture of a baboon (sitting or lying with neck relaxed and head hung). Sustained dormant behavior in 
1133 
the typical sleep posture was considered sleep. Video scoring resulted in a total of 8.0 hours of 
1134 
behavioral observation across a total of 16 individual baboons.  
1135 
Synchronizing the thermal imagery data with the accelerometry data produced a validation 
1136 
dataset of 294 minute-epochs across six baboons that were both classified as either sleep or wakeful 
1137 
behavior from accelerometry, and scored as wakefulness, resting wakefulness, or sleep from direct 
1138 
observation. With both wakefulness and resting wakefulness representing wakeful behavior, the 
1139 
accelerometer-based sleep classification exhibited an accuracy of 79.9% (Table S12). Consistent with 
1140 
previous validation studies of the use of accelerometry in measuring sleep (Ancoli-Israel et al., 2003; 
1141 
de Souza et al., 2003), we found that accelerometer-based sleep classification has difficulty 
1142 
distinguishing resting wakefulness from sleep, and we consider this limitation in our interpretation of 
1143 
the results.

timing of night. The night permutation procedure was repeated 1000 times to generate a null 
98 
distribution for the proportion of minutes in which at least one individual is awake during the night 
99 
and the mean proportion of the group exhibiting synchronized behavior. B) Comparison of the 
100 
empirical proportion of minutes in which at least one individual is awake (red dotted line) to its null 
101 
distribution (grey density plot; p < 0.0001). C) Comparison of the empirical mean of the proportion of 
102 
the group exhibiting synchronized behavior (red dotted line) to its null distribution (grey density plot; 
103 
p < 0.0001). This method of permutation controls for the possibility that baboons are synchronized in 
104 
their behavior simply as a result of species-typical nocturnal waking patterns that are consistent across 
105 
baboons and across nights.

Sleep validation study 
108 
 
109 
To evaluate whether the accelerometer-based sleep classification technique was accurately 
110 
monitoring sleep in baboons, we returned to Mpala Research Centre in July 2019 to perform a 
111 
validation study in which we compared the results of the accelerometer-based sleep classification to 
112 
direct observations of awake and sleeping baboons. Using the procedures described in Strandburg-
113 
Peshkin et al., 2015, we trapped and anesthetized 27 members of a group of habituated olive baboons, 
114 
fitting each with a GPS and accelerometry collar. Eleven of the 27 collars deployed recorded 
115 
continuous tri-axial accelerations at 12 Hz/axis from 06:30 to 18:00 and 0.71-second bursts of 
116

accelerations at 56.2 Hz/axis at the beginning of every minute from 18:00 to 06:30. Accelerometry 
117 
data was collected by each of these 11 collars for up to 31 days. The remaining 16 collars did not 
118 
collect accelerometry data from 06:30 to 18:00, and thus we excluded data from these collars from the 
119 
validation study. 
120 
We down-sampled and interpolated the accelerometry data such that it matched the sampling 
121 
frequency and schedule of the data collected in 2012 (i.e. the data analyzed for this manuscript). We 
122 
then applied the sleep classification algorithm described in the Materials and Methods to this 
123 
validation dataset. 
124 
To validate the sleep classification algorithm, we performed direct behavioral observations of 
125 
the baboons at their primary sleep site. We recorded the behavior of the study baboons starting when 
126 
they approached their sleep site using a FLIR T1020 high-resolution infrared camera (FLIR Systems 
127 
Inc., Wilsonville, OR, USA). Recordings continued into the night for as long as the camera battery 
128 
allowed (average recording duration (range of recording durations): 7.4 hours (1.7 – 14.9 hours)), and 
129 
we collected thermal imaging data on 21 nights. We identified individuals in the thermal imagery both 
130 
in real-time, via observer narration of the recorded imagery, and post-recording, by matching 
131 
movements of individuals in the thermal imagery to the GPS tracks of collared individuals. 
132 
Following initial data collection, we used the commercial software Loopy (Loopbio GmbH, 
133 
Austria) to score the behavior of identified individuals in the thermal imagery. Individuals’ behavior 
134 
was scored as “wakefulness”, “resting wakefulness”, or “sleep”. Wakefulness refers to any behavior 
135 
involving active movement (i.e. walking, running) or engaged activity (i.e. allogrooming), whereas 
136 
resting wakefulness refers to behaviors that are dormant (i.e. sitting), but not in the typical sleeping 
137 
posture of a baboon (sitting or lying with neck relaxed and head hung). Sustained dormant behavior in 
138 
the typical sleep posture was considered sleep. Video scoring resulted in a total of 8.0 hours of 
139 
behavioral observation across a total of 16 individual baboons.  
140 
Synchronizing the thermal imagery data with the accelerometry data produced a validation 
141 
dataset of 294 minute-epochs across six baboons that were both classified as either sleep or wakeful 
142 
behavior from accelerometry, and scored as wakefulness, resting wakefulness, or sleep from direct 
143 
observation. With both wakefulness and resting wakefulness representing wakeful behavior, the 
144 
accelerometer-based sleep classification exhibited an accuracy of 79.9% (Table S12). Consistent with 
145 
previous validation studies of the use of accelerometry in measuring sleep (Ancoli-Israel et al., 2003; 
146 
de Souza et al., 2003), we found that accelerometer-based sleep classification has difficulty 
147 
distinguishing resting wakefulness from sleep, and we consider this limitation in our interpretation of 
148 
the results.
