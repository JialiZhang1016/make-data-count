Ammonia solution etching was carried out on thermally-oxidised cuprous oxide (TO-Cu2O) in
photocathode devices for water splitting. The etched devices showed increased photoelectrochemical
(PEC) performance compared to the unetched ones as well as improved reproducibility. 8.6 mA cm2
and 7 mA cm2 photocurrent density were achieved at 0 V and 0.5 V versus the reversible hydrogen
electrode (VRHE), respectively, in the champion sample with an onset potential of 0.92 VRHE and a fill
factor of 44%. An applied bias photon-to-current eﬃciency of 3.6% at 0.56 VRHE was obtained, which
represents a new record for Cu2O-based photocathode systems. Capacitance-based profiling studies
showed a strong pinning eﬀect from interfacial traps in the as-grown device, and these traps were
removed by ammonia solution etching. Moreover, the etching procedure gave rise to a diverse
morphology of Cu2O crystals based on the diﬀerent crystallographic orientations. The distribution of
crystallographic orientations and the relationship between the crystal orientation and the morphology
after etching were examined by electron backscatter diﬀraction (EBSD) and scanning electron
microscopy (SEM). The high-index crystal group showed a statistically higher PEC performance than the
low-index group. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
revealed metallic copper at the Cu2O/Ga2O3 interface, which we attribute as the dominant trap that
limits the PEC performance. It is concluded that the metallic copper originates from the reduction of the
CuO impurity layer on the as-grown Cu2O sample during the ALD process, while the reduction from
Cu2O to Cu is not favourable.
Broader context
The global goal of carbon neutrality has increased the demands for sustainable and environmentally-friendly energy sources and energy carriers. Producing
hydrogen through water splitting driven by solar illumination with the photoelectrochemical (PEC) method is an attractive strategy. To achieve cost-eﬀective
hydrogen production from this method, the eﬃciency and the stability of the light absorber materials must be high, and to reach a large scale, the PEC devices
should be prepared from abundant elements and fabricated in a simple and low-cost manner. Cuprous oxide (Cu2O) is a promising p-type semiconductor
material that could meet the above requirements if the eﬃciency could be improved. In this work, ammonia solution etching was adopted to eliminate the
surface traps on thermally-oxidised Cu2O, thereby improving the hydrogen production eﬃciency. The etching procedure revealed a crystal orientation
dependence on the performance of the photocathode, related to interface states at the Cu2O/Ga2O3 heterojunction, which comprises the photovoltage-
generating junction. This discovery points the way to further improvements with Cu2O towards practical water splitting cells.
1 Introduction
In the past few years, many countries worldwide have declared
their road map for reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to
achieve net-zero emission by 2050.1 Most CO2 emissions are
from energy consumption by traditional energy sources such as
oil and coal.2 Finding alternatives to fossil fuels is crucial to
achieving these goals. Hydrogen (H2), a potential carrier of

clean energy, has attracted much attention from researchers.
Unfortunately, the large majority of hydrogen used now is still
produced from fossil fuels.3 Producing H2 by photoelectro-
chemical (PEC) water splitting is a very promising strategy with
the help of sunlight.4–6
To achieve eﬃcient PEC water splitting, a suitable band gap
and good electronic properties are essential for light absorption
and photo-generated electron transport.7,8 Cu2O, as an intrinsic
p-type semiconductor with a band gap of 2.1 eV, has been
widely studied in the past decades for photovoltaic devices.9–11
In addition, the conduction band edge of 0.7 eV versus RHE
makes it a promising candidate material as a photocathode for
water splitting.12 Paracchino et al. reported a Cu2O-based
photocathode with a photocurrent density of 7.6 mA cm2
at 0 VRHE and an onset potential of 0.35 VRHE.13 In the following
years, the PEC performance has been improved to 10 mA cm2
photocurrent density at 0 VRHE and over 0.8 VRHE onset potential,
benefitting from a nanostructuring approach combined with a
wide band gap semiconductor material as a buffer layer, albeit
with a poor fill factor.14–16 Correspondingly, the applied bias
photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) is modest and normally
has a relatively low peak position versus RHE, which hinders
its application in unbiased water splitting systems.
The most studied methods to fabricate Cu2O include
electrodeposition,17,18
thermal
oxidation,19,20
and
reactive
sputtering.21,22 Among them, thermal oxidation is an eﬀective
approach to grow a high-quality Cu2O sheet with large grain
sizes up to millimetres. In our previous research, we prepared a
thermally-oxidised cuprous oxide (TO-Cu2O) photocathode and
studied its unique carrier transport behaviour.23 However, the
photocurrent and fill factor left room for improvement. Traps
on the surface of the TO-Cu2O (which become the interfacial
traps in the multilayer photocathode device) could be one of
the factors that hurt its photocurrent and fill factor.24 Chemical
etching is a facile and eﬀective way to remove surface traps.25,26
Minami et al. applied a three-step etching procedure to remove
the CuO layer when preparing a TO-Cu2O based solar cell.27
Ammonia solution was used in etching electrodeposited Cu2O
film in solar cell devices, which improved both the photo-
voltage and photocurrent.26 However, the mechanism of the
improvement has been rarely discussed.
In this paper, the TO-Cu2O sheets were etched by ammonia
solution to remove any contamination on the as-grown Cu2O
before the atomic layer deposition (ALD) process (Fig. S1, ESI†).
The etching procedure significantly boosted the photocurrent
density and fill factor. With capacitance-based techniques
including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), the
eﬀect of the surface-related traps on the carrier transport was
analysed. Etching of the sheets revealed a diverse morphology that
depends on the crystal orientation of the grains. By classifying the
crystal orientation using electron backscatter diﬀraction (EBSD)
mapping and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), we further
compared the PEC performance of TO-Cu2O photocathodes based
on high-index and low-index crystals. Depth-profiling X-ray

photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) revealed the evolution of surface traps during
the etching and ALD processes. With a higher ABPE at more
positive applied voltage, this work further promotes the applica-
tion of Cu2O-based photocathodes in an unbiased water splitting
system and elucidates the possible ways to further improve its
performance.
2 Results and discussion
2.1
PEC performance of the etched TO-Cu2O photocathode
The as-grown TO-Cu2O sheets were immersed in concentrated
ammonia solution for diﬀerent times at room temperature
(details can be found in the experimental section and Fig. S1
of the ESI†). The improvement of the PEC performance by the
ammonia solution etching is noticeable, as shown in Fig. 1a.
The champion photocathode device with 60 minutes of etching
time has a photocurrent density of 8.6 mA cm2 and 7 mA cm2
at 0 VRHE and 0.5 VRHE, respectively, while without etching the
values are 6.6 mA cm2 and 4.8 mA cm2. Statistical data for
devices fabricated with 0 (unetched), 15, 30, and 60 minutes of
etching are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The photocurrent density at
both 0 VRHE and 0.5 VRHE increases at longer etching times,
plateauing at 60 minutes. The onset potential does not show a
clear trend. Since the onset potential is quite sensitive to the
thickness of the Ga2O3 layer and the thickness of the Ga2O3 shows
small variations, it is presumed that the etching has no apparent
eﬀect on the onset potential. Compared with the unetched samples,
the etched samples have a higher fill factor.
With 60 minutes of etching, the ABPE increased from 2.5%
to 3.6% (Fig. 1b). The ABPE peak at 0.56 VRHE is significant
when making tandem devices for unbiased water splitting and
represents a new record (Table S1, ESI†). The stability was
measured under one sun at 0.5 VRHE (Fig. 1c). The photocurrent
density under continuous light decreased slightly on day 1 and
day 2, but it recovered after changing the electrolyte or removing
the bubbles from the surface of the photocathode. The decrease
in the first two days could be due to the attached bubbles on the
surface of the device (see Fig. S3, ESI†). The rapid decrease of
photocurrent after nine hours of test is due to the real failure of
the device. The corrosion of the photocathode mostly happens at
the grain boundary of the TO-Cu2O, which is visible to the naked
eye due to the large grain sizes in the device. Thus, the stability
does not show obvious improvement compared with the
unetched device in our previous publication.23 In Fig. 1d and e,
we compared the incident photon-to-current eﬃciency (IPCE)
of the unetched and etched photocathodes. After etching, the
IPCE is increased at all wavelength regions from 625 nm to
350 nm. The absolute gain is almost the same. However, the
relative increase in the blue region is higher than that of the
green region. At 0.5 VRHE, the IPCE at 525 nm can exceed 60%,
which is crucial to preparing a tandem device for unbiased
overall water splitting.
2.2
Interfacial traps study by capacitance techniques
According to the cross-sectional SEM image of the etched
TO-Cu2O (Fig. S4, ESI†), the thickness change during etching
is negligible compared to the thickness of the Cu2O sheet.

Thus, the PEC gain does not benefit from the decreased
thickness of the Cu2O sheet, which is discussed in our previous
publication.23 Yet the etching change on the surface of the
TO-Cu2O sheet plays a vital role in the improvement. To
evaluate the change in surface trap density (interfacial traps
in multilayer fabricated photocathode device), capacitance–
voltage profiling (C–V profiling) and drive-level-capacitance
profiling (DLCP) measurements were performed in the dark
on two diode devices (unetched and etched) with the structure
Au/TO-Cu2O/Ga2O3/TiO2/Ag (Fig. S5, ESI†).
The standard capacitance profiling data can provide the
charge carrier density at the Cu2O/Ga2O3 interface. However,
it cannot distinguish between bulk and interface defects, since
both types of defects respond to this type of measurement.
In contrast, DLCP is normally assumed to be insensitive to
interfacial traps. By comparing these two measurements, we
could estimate the traps from the interface that the ammonia
solution etching could remove. This technique has been used
to analyse the defects in Si,28 CuIn1xGaxSe2,29 Cu2ZnSnSe4,30
and perovskite31 solar cells.
Fig. 2a and b shows the C–V charge density-profile depth
(NCV  hxi) plots and Fig. 2c and d gives the DLCP charge
density-profile depth (NDL  hxi) plots, extracted from the raw
data of C–V measurement (Fig. S6, ESI†) and DLCP measurement
(Fig. S7, ESI†). The details for extracting the data in Fig. 2 can be
found in the ESI.† The charge density at VDC = 0 V was chosen to
estimate the free carrier and trap density.
In the capacitance–voltage plots in Fig. S6 (ESI†), the capa-
citance of the unetched sample is obviously pinned from 0.1 V
to 0.2 V while that of the etched sample changes smoothly as
the applied voltage increases (from reverse to forward bias) over
the same region due to the narrowing width of the space charge
region on the Cu2O side. Correspondingly, the sharp peak at
around 0 VDC bias for each frequency is a clear difference
between the unetched and etched devices. Since the etching
very likely only changes the surface properties of the TO-Cu2O,
the pinning effect is related to the traps at the Cu2O/Ga2O3
interface. The peak of the charge density is stable at around
3.5  1016 cm3 for the AC frequency 10 kHz and below. When
the diodes were interrogated with an AC bias at 1 MHz, both the
etched and unetched diodes showed a charge density of around
3  1014 cm3, which is slightly higher than the free carrier
density of the TO-Cu2O measured by Hall measurement due to
the presence of the interfacial traps.23
In theory, DLCP is not sensitive to the interfacial traps.
However, in our case, the interfacial traps still significantly
aﬀect the measured charge density, as depicted in Fig. 2c. What is
noticeable here is that the pinning eﬀect of the capacitance at around
0 VDC bias can also be observed in the DLCP (Fig. S7, ESI†),
while in the etched sample there is almost no peak shown in the
near-zero bias region (Fig. 2d). Without the interference of inter-
facial traps, the charge density is 1.5  1014 cm3, derived from
NDL at 1 MHz (NDL,1MHz), which is regarded as the free carrier
density in bulk TO-Cu2O and matches well with the value in the
literature. Table 1 summaries the NDL and NCV at diﬀerent
frequencies at VDC = 0 V. By subtracting NDL,1MHz from NDL,1kHz
of the etched sample, the trap density in the bulk TO-Cu2O is
estimated to be 4.5  1014 cm3. The interfacial trap density can
be calculated by subtracting NDL,1kHz of the etched sample from
NCV,1kHz of the unetched or etched samples. The values for the
unetched and etched samples are 3.4  1016 cm3 and 9.0 
1014 cm3, respectively. After etching, the interfacial trap density
is markedly reduced.
Additionally, EIS was applied to study the charge carrier
behaviour in pH 7 solution under 10% sunlight intensity. The
equivalent circuit model used to fit the data after the photo-
current onset consists of 3 RC elements in series (plus a series
resistance) for the etched sample. In the unetched sample, the
equivalent circuit contained 4 RC elements plus the series
resistance (Fig. S8a, ESI†). CPE elements were used to model
the capacitances with the ideality factor not going below 0.8.
The Nyquist and the Bode plots (Fig. S8b, c and S9a, ESI†)
obtained from the EIS of samples at 0 VRHE and 200 mVRHE
show 3 and 4 elements, respectively. Fig. S9b (ESI†) shows
the extracted resistances and capacitances from the fitting
procedures. The observed elements in the equivalent circuit
are not assigned to a specific (photo)physical process.
However, we observe that even though the devices are fabri-
cated similarly with only one additional etching step of
the Cu2O surface, the main diﬀerence in the fitting results
is the additional RC element in the unetched sample
(Fig. S9b, c (ESI†), R_MF2 and Tau_MF2). As the JV curves
under 10% sunlight for the etched and unetched samples
diﬀer mainly in the FF, the reduction of the FF in the
unetched sample is probably based on this additional resis-
tive element, representing a series resistance for the photo-
generated charges.
2.3
Single-crystal TO-Cu2O photocathodes
The morphology of the etched sample drew our attention.
Generally, the surface of the as-grown TO-Cu2O is smooth with
a uniform colour, whilst that of the etched sample shows a
diﬀerent morphology at diﬀerent crystal facets (Fig. S10, ESI†).
To investigate the relationship between the morphology after
etching and the crystallographic orientation, we performed EBSD
measurements on an etched TO-Cu2O sheet. Fig. 3a and b shows
the orientation map and the grain orientation distribution. The
polycrystalline sheet is strongly textured, dominated by grains

with (111) or (101) planes parallel to the surface of the Cu2O sheet,
while almost no crystal with [001] orientation was found. Single-
crystal XRD analysis of a portion of one of these domains (sample
size 0.52  0.39  0.075 mm3) confirms that the uni-coloured
domains of up to several millimetres in Fig. 3 are indeed single-
crystalline, as shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†).
By measuring the SEM image of each site, we can determine
the relationship between morphology and orientation. Typically,
the deep blue grains with [111] orientation have a flat surface
with some regular pyramidal pits (Fig. S12, ESI†). The shape of
the pit matches well with a negative imprint of the corner of
the cubic crystal structure of Cu2O. At the green site, regular
ridge-shaped humps are related to the edge of the cubic crystal
(Fig. S13, ESI†). Another typical morphology is found at the
purple site with [hh1] orientation (typically [112] or [223]), which
is also flat but with some shallow isosceles triangular pyramid-
shaped hollows (Fig. S14, ESI†). The grains with other colours,
far from the corner or edge of the unit triangle in Fig. 3b, have a
more diverse morphology. We selected some sites to show the
morphology in Fig. S15 (ESI†). With the crystal orientation and
SEM morphology, these crystals could be roughly divided into
two groups: the low index group (LIG), including the blue, green
and purple sites, with (111), (101), and (hh1) planes parallel to
the surface of the Cu2O sheet, respectively; and the high index
group (HIG), including all crystals with other colours, which has
a high index plane parallel to the surface.
The crystal size of Cu2O grown by thermal oxidation is up to
millimetres. Thus, it is possible to compare the photocathode
device PEC performance in relation to the two groups (HIG and LIG).
Samples with a single crystal TO-Cu2O sheet after 60 minutes of
etching were prepared, as shown in Fig. S16 (ESI†). The
reflected and the transmitted light through the edge of the
surrounding epoxy cannot be ignored for such a small area
photocathode, so we only compare the relative PEC performance
between these two groups. To avoid any possibility of preferential
photodeposition of catalyst on the diﬀerent grains, 1 nm Pt was
sputtered as the catalyst instead of the RuOx in the single-crystal
devices. The statistical data of the PEC performance is shown
in Fig. 4. The photocurrent density is higher in the high index
crystal group than the low index crystal group at 0 VRHE and
0.5 VRHE. The IPCE data also shows that the high index device has
a much higher quantum eﬃciency from 400 nm to 550 nm as
compared to the low index device at 0 VRHE and 0.5 VRHE (Fig. S17,
ESI†). The HIG samples have a higher onset potential than the
LIG, with a slightly higher fill factor, due to the diverse micro-
structures in the high index group.
EIS was performed with two representative single-crystal
photocathode devices (HIG and LIG). Three elements could
be extracted from the Nyquist plots of both samples (Fig. S18,
ESI†), meaning that both samples behave similarly to the large
etched sample with both high-index and low-index crystals.
The increasing high-frequency resistances (R_HF, red lines)
further support that both samples are etched (note that the
R_HF of the unetched sample is almost constant over the range
of potentials used, Fig. S9, ESI†). Despite their similarities, the
R_HF of the low index sample is relatively low, while the high

index device is almost identical to the etched sample presented
in Fig. S9 (ESI†). The discrepancy between the high and low
index samples indicates that the etching process is more
eﬀective for the high index sample, implying selective etching
depending on the crystal orientation. The selective etching is
further supported by the lifetime of the high-frequency arc
(Tau_HF, Fig. S18b, ESI†) as well as the performance diﬀerences
in Fig. 4. The C–V profiling experiments were also conducted
on high-index and low-index single-crystal devices, as shown in
Fig. S19 (ESI†). The derived charge density showed that the
interfacial traps in both low-index and high-index devices were
reduced to some extent. The high-index device had a lower
interfacial trap density compared to the low-index device, which
is consistent with the observed PEC performance and the EIS
analysis.
2.4
The origin of the interfacial traps
To further reveal the eﬀect of the ammonia solution etching,
depth profile XPS was performed on the bare TO-Cu2O samples
with and without etching (Fig. S20, ESI†). From the Cu 2p peak
at 932.6 eV and the Cu LMM Auger peak at 916.9 eV, we can
confirm that Cu+ is the only existing state in the bulk of
TO-Cu2O. However, two apparent features of CuO – the Cu 2p
shoulder peak at around 934.9 eV and the broad satellite peak
from 940 eV to 945 eV (Fig. 5a) – are found at the surface of
the as-grown TO-Cu2O. After etching, only the peak at around
932.6 eV was detected, which is from the Cu2O. In addition, the
weak satellite peak from 943 eV to 947 eV is another typical
feature of Cu2O. In the depth profile XPS study of the bare
TO-Cu2O, the peak that belongs to CuO disappeared after
only brief sputtering (1 minute), which means the CuO layer
is relatively thin.

Depth profile XPS on two TO-Cu2O samples (with and
without etching) with a 5 nm ALD Ga2O3 layer were conducted
to reveal the copper oxidation states at the interface of Cu2O and
Ga2O3 in the photocathode device (Fig. S21, ESI†). Compared
with the etched sample, the Cu 2p showed a small shoulder peak
at 934 eV, possibly from CuO. However, from Cu LMM Auger
peaks, no clear diﬀerence was observed. At the interface of Cu2O/
Ga2O3, a clear metallic copper peak at 918.7 eV was observed in
both samples. The small shoulder peak at 921.4 eV is another
typical feather of the Cu0 (Fig. 5b). Two Cu2O samples with a
5 nm Au layer on the surface were prepared to investigate the
origin of the metallic copper. The Cu LMM Auger data in the
depth profile XPS showed only a small peak for Cu2+ (918.0 eV),
but no metallic copper (Cu0) at the interface of the Cu2O and Au
(Fig. S22, ESI†). Thereby, it can be concluded that metallic copper
is formed during the ALD process of the Ga2O3 deposition.
Cross-sectional TEM images were obtained to investigate the
microstructure at the Cu2O/Ga2O3 interface. The cross-sectional
TEM lamellae were prepared by focused ion beam (FIB). To get
two diﬀerent crystal sites in one lamella, the lamellae were cut
and lifted out by FIB along the red line crossing the grain
boundary of two crystals (Fig. S23, ESI†). In the etched sample,
one side is the high index area, while the other side belongs to
the low index area, which could be distinguished by the surface
morphology. In the unetched sample, it was not possible to
determine the crystal orientation by morphology.
As shown in Fig. 6a, the thickness of the TiO2 and the Ga2O3
layers match well with that observed on the reference silicon
wafer of the ALD process. In the STEM bright-field image, the
RuOx dots are the darkest, while the TiO2 layer is brightest due
to mass contrast. Notably, a clear dark line (or dots) at the
Cu2O/Ga2O3 interface was observed, indicating the existence of
a thin layer. This observation, along with the depth profile XPS
data, suggests that the dark line is most likely thin metallic
copper. The EDS maps confirmed this as shown in Fig. 6b–f.
An obvious dark line, corresponding to an oxygen-poor area,
could be observed in the O map (Fig. 6d) at the interface of the
Cu2O and Ga2O3. This metallic Cu layer could also be confirmed
in the high-angle annular dark-field STEM image, which showed
a bright contrast in the HAADF STEM image (Fig. 6b). In the
STEM bright-field image from the high index area of the etched
sample, even though there is still a clear similar dark area, no
obvious bright contrast is observed in the HAADF STEM image
(Fig. 6h) and the O mapping image does not show an oxygen-
poor area (Fig. 6j), indicating no metallic Cu layer here. However,
in the low index area, this oxygen-poor area has again appeared.
In Fig. S24 (ESI†), we show the HAADF and EDS mapping in
these four sites. The metallic copper layer in the etched device is
reduced to some extent.
In Table S2 (ESI†), we summarize the XPS and TEM data in
the etched and unetched samples. In the unetched sample, a
thin CuO layer is formed during the oxidation process of copper
foil. However, the CuO is not the origin of the interfacial traps
in the device, but metallic copper, which arises from the
reduction of the CuO layer by the ALD precursor. In the etched
sample, in general, less metallic copper was detected compared
with the unetched sample. The high index area is more
eﬀectively etched than the low index area, consistent with the
PEC performance. Many literature reports have indicated that
reducing CuO is more favourable than reducing Cu2O. Moreover,
the CuO is preferentially reduced directly to metallic Cu without
forming intermediates or suboxides.32–34 This offers an explanation

for why the as-grown sample with the CuO layer has more metallic
copper at the Cu2O/Ga2O3 interface. After etching by ammonia
solution, the formation of metallic copper from the Cu2O is less
feasible, and also less CuO is present for the copper formation
process.
3 Conclusions
Surface etching of Cu2O by ammonia solution has proven to be
an eﬀective method to boost the PEC performance of TO-Cu2O
based photocathodes. The champion device achieved a photo-
current density of 8.6 mA cm2 and 7 mA cm2 at 0 VRHE and
0.5 VRHE, respectively, and an onset potential of 0.92 VRHE, while
yielding an ABPE of 3.6%, a new record for Cu2O-based photo-
cathode systems. Capacitance–voltage measurements as well as
EIS confirm that the interfacial traps at the Cu2O/Ga2O3 interface
could be removed by etching, thereby dramatically increasing
the carrier lifetime in the etched sample. The revealed morphol-
ogy by etching is highly correlated to the Cu2O grain orientation.
The high index group has a much better PEC performance than
the low index group, as less metallic copper is formed at the
Cu2O/Ga2O3 interface. Metallic copper is the main interfacial
trap that reduces the PEC performance in the unetched sample,
produced as a result of the reduction of the surface CuO layer
during the ALD process. In contrast, the etched sample without a
CuO layer is more resistant to this process. This investigation
shows how with further engineering of the Cu2O surface PEC
performance can be improved.
