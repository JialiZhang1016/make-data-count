Abstract
Background: Different mosquito-borne pathogens are circulating in Iran including Sindbis virus, West Nile virus,
filarioid worms and malaria parasites. However, the local transmission cycles of these pathogenic agents are poorly
understood, especially because ecological data on vector species are scarce and there is limited knowledge about
the host range; this understanding could help to direct species-specific vector control measurements or to prioritize
research.
Methods: In the summers of 2015 and 2016, blood-fed mosquitoes were collected at 13 trapping sites on the
coast of the Caspian Sea in northern Iran and at an additional trapping site in western Iran. Mosquitoes were
generally collected with either a Biogents Sentinel trap or a Heavy Duty Encephalitis Vector Survey trap installed
outside. A handheld aspirator was used at the trapping site in western Iran, in addition to a few samplings
around the other trapping sites. On average, eight trapping periods were conducted per trapping site. The
sources of blood meals were identified using a DNA barcoding approach targeting the cytochrome b or 16S
rRNA gene fragment.
Results: The source of blood meals for 580 blood-fed mosquito specimens of 20 different taxa were determined,
resulting in the identification of 13 different host species (9 mammals including humans, 3 birds and 1 reptile),
whereby no mixed blood meals were detected. Five mosquito species represented more than 85.8% of all
collected blood-fed specimens: Culex pipiens pipiens form pipiens (305 specimens, 55.7% of all mosquito specimens), Cx.
theileri (60, 10.9%), Cx. sitiens (51, 9.3%), Cx. perexiguus (29, 5.3%) and Anopheles superpictus (25, 4.6%). The most
commonly detected hosts of the four most abundant mosquito species were humans (Homo sapiens; 224
mosquito specimens, 40.9% of all mosquito specimens), cattle (Bos taurus; 171, 31.2%) and ducks (Anas spp.; 75,
13.7%). These four mosquito species had similar host-feeding patterns. The only exceptions were a relatively
high proportion of birds for Cx. pipiens pipiens f. pipiens (23.2% of detected blood meal sources) and a high
proportion of non-human mammals for Cx. theileri (73.4%). Trapping month, surrounding area, or trapping
method had no statistically significant impact on the observed host-feeding patterns of Cx. pipiens pipiens f. pipiens.
Conclusions: Due to the diverse and overlapping host-feeding patterns, several mosquito species must be considered
as potential enzootic and bridge vectors for diverse mosquito-borne pathogens in Iran. Most species can potentially
transmit pathogens between mammals as well as between mammals and birds, which might be the result of a similar
host selection or a high dependence on the host availability.

Background
Different mosquito-borne pathogens are circulating in
Iran, including Sindbis virus (SINV) [1], West Nile virus
(WNV) [2] and filarioid worms [3]. The country is under
significant risk for the introduction of highly vector-
competent, exotic mosquito species and associated path-
ogens from neighboring countries or through inter-
national travel as demonstrated by the recent detection
of the invasive Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus)
[4] and associated emergence of dengue virus [5].
Information on the hosts of mosquitoes is necessary to
identify potential vector species under field conditions
[6, 7], so that species-specific control measurements can
be directed [8]. There are essentially three types of study
method to identify the blood meal source of wild mos-
quitoes: direct observation of the blood foraging on the
host, host-baited traps, and the analysis of the blood
content in the mosquito gut [9]. Several studies have an-
alyzed the blood meals of various mosquito species [10].
Before 1996 [11], these studies were mostly limited to a
distinction of broad host groups, e.g. “bird” instead of
“European blackbird (Turdus merula)” [9]. Since the ad-
vent of molecular methods, this field of vector research
advanced from basic immunological analysis to deoxy-
ribonucleic acid (DNA) barcoding and DNA fingerprint-
ing [9, 12]. In addition, as highlighted by Gunathilaka et
al. [13], these polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based as-
says are less costly and time-consuming while having a
higher sensitivity. Furthermore, cloning of the PCR
amplicons might even allow the detection of mixed
blood meals.
The mosquito fauna of Iran is diverse, including 64
species and three subspecies in seven genera [14]. How-
ever, only a few studies have determined the hosts of
mosquitoes in Iran, which have predominantly focused
on selected species of the 28 known Anopheles species
in the country. Basseri et al. [15] and Yeryan et al. [16]
examined the feeding patterns of different Anopheles
species by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
tests to identify blood meals of human origin. Less than
40% of all specimens had fed on humans. However, stud-
ies on other mosquito genera are missing, e.g. Culex
species, which are the most important vectors of SINV
and WNV [1, 2]. In addition, due to the limitations of
the previously applied screening techniques, other host-
species remain undetermined. DNA barcoding assays
give a specific understanding of the selected hosts com-
pared to ELISA assays [9, 12], allowing the closing of the
research gap regarding the host-associations of Iranian
mosquito species, and thus providing a deeper under-
standing of the transmission cycles and dynamics of
mosquito-borne pathogens [17]. In addition, studies that
have estimated the prevalence of mosquito-borne patho-
gens in Iran were mostly based on the screening of
humans [2] or animals [9, 18], whereas only a few stud-
ies conducted vector surveillance [19]. Insights into the
host range of mosquito species can lead to a prioritized
research agenda focused on these species, which may be
potential vectors for pathogens [20]. Therefore, with the
aim to identify potential mosquito vector species, this
study utilized a DNA barcoding approach to identify the
hosts of Iranian mosquitoes and analyze the variability
of host-feeding patterns in space and time.
Methods
Blood-fed mosquito females were collected in 2015 and
2016 within a study on the distribution of mosquito-
borne pathogens at 13 trapping sites in northern Iran
along the coast of the Caspian Sea and at an additional
trapping site in western Iran [21] (Fig. 1). The surround-
ing areas around the trapping sites were predominantly
characterised as “urban” (1 site), “rural” (8 sites) or “nat-
ural” (5 sites). The trapping sites were selected to be rep-
resentative for the coastal area of the Caspian Sea and
protected against vandalism. The sites were charac-
terised by a mixture of natural vegetation (e.g. shrubs,
herbs, a few trees), small water bodies (e.g. ditches) and
pastures. As the collections were predominantly made
on public lands, no specific permissions were required
to access the study sites. Permission of each house
owner was obtained for indoor samplings. Mosquito
collections were conducted with Biogents Sentinel traps
(BG trap; Biogents, Regensburg, Germany), Heavy Duty
Encephalitis Vector Survey traps (EVS trap; BioQuip
Products, Rancho Dominguez, CA, USA), handheld as-
pirators, and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention) gravid trap model 1712 (John W. Hook
Company, Gainesville, FL, USA) [22]. Due to availabil-
ity problems, CO2 from a gas cylinders for the BG traps
was only available in the year 2015 (193 specimens col-
lected with this method). Thus, sugar-fermenting yeast
was used in 2016 (Turbo Yeast Pure 48, Alcotec, Dron-
field, UK; 5 g yeast, 5 g sugar, 500 ml water) as an organic
source of carbon dioxide (85 mosquito specimens). EVS
traps with CO2 from dry ice collected 27 mosquito
specimens and 265 mosquito specimens were collected
with handheld aspirators. No blood-fed specimens were
collected with gravid traps with a hay infusion as ovi-
position attractant. BG traps, EVS traps and gravid
traps were installed between 7:00 h and 11:00 h, with
mosquitoes collected after approximately 24 or 48 h.
Due to large distances between the trapping sites, sam-
pling was conducted on different dates. Exact trapping
methods per date and sites are provided in Additional
file 1: Table S1. In general, one mosquito trap (BG trap
or EVS trap) was installed per trapping site. Depending
on the availability of dry ice, either EVS or BG traps
were used; in a few exceptional cases, both traps were

used in parallel. In addition, the handheld aspirator was
used in parallel at some trapping dates for the collec-
tion of mosquitoes from vegetation around the trapping
sites. Between 1 and 36 trapping periods were con-
ducted per trapping site over the two years (on average
7.9 trapping periods).
Sampling with handheld aspirators was conducted in
the morning (8:00–11:00 h) or evening (16:00–18:00 h)
for 1 h indoors (human dwellings and animal shelters
with host nearby) at the trapping site in western Iran
(which was not sampled with the other trap types), and
2 h at the other trapping sites to account for the diver-
sity of the outdoor environments. Vegetation or walls of
dwellings and shelters were visually checked for mosqui-
toes and detected specimens sampled with the aspirator.
After collection, mosquito specimens were directly
stored on dry ice and kept frozen during morphological
identification on chill tables [23, 24]. Furthermore, mor-
phologically identified Culex pipiens (s.l.) specimens
were typed to species level (Cx. pipiens pipiens f. pipiens,
Cx. pipiens pipiens f. molestus or Cx. pipiens cf. quinque-
fasciatus) using a molecular assay [25].
For DNA isolation, the whole body of each mosquito
specimen was transferred to a 2 ml tube with 20 pieces
of 2.0 mm zirconia beads (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville,
USA) and 1 ml of cell culture medium (high-glucose
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium; Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA). Specimens were homogenised with a
Tissuelyser LT (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for 2 min at
50 oscillations/s. DNA was extracted from 200 μl of the
homogenate using the KingFisher™Flex Magnetic Par-
ticle Processor with the MagMAX™Pathogen ribonucleic
acid/DNA Kit (both Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA USA). A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting
the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene was conducted
with a primer pair first published by Kitano et al. [26]:
L2513 (5'-GCC TGT TTA CCA AAA ACA TCA C-3')
and H2714 (5'-CTC CAT AGG GTC TTC TCG TCT
T-3') (~244 bp). However, it is well known that the dif-
ferent primer sets for host-species identification have a
high variability regarding their taxa-specific sensitivity
[27]. Therefore, if the PCR based on the first primer pair
did not work, an additional primer pair targeting the 16S
rDNA fragment was applied in an additional PCR:
L14841 (5'-CCA TCC AAC ATC TCA GCA TGA TGA
AA-3') and H15149 (5'-CCC TCA GAA TGA TAT TTG
TCC TCA-3') (~358 bp) [28]. For each PCR reaction,
HotStarTaq Plus Master Mix Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA,
USA) was used with the following temperature profile
for each PCR reaction: incubation at 95 °C for 5 min;
40 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for
30 s; and finally completed by incubation at 72 °C for 5
min. Visualization of amplicons was conducted by elec-
trophoresis in a 2% agarose gel with added Midori
Green Advance (Biozym Biotech, Hessisch Oldendorf,
Germany). In addition, a positive control (blood from
humans, Homo sapiens; moose, Alces alces; or Euro-
pean blackbird, Turdus merula) and negative control
(distilled water; Ampuwa, Fresenius Kabi Deutschland
GmbH, Bad Homburg, Germany) were used in each

PCR. All amplicons were further processed with Sanger
sequencing (LGC Genomics, Berlin, Germany), pre-
processed with Geneious® 7.1.9 [29] and finally com-
pared to GenBank sequences (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.-
gov/Blast.cgi).
The statistical computer program R [30] was used for
all data analysis. Data manipulation and visualization
was conducted with functions from the packages plyr
[31] and ggplot2 [32]. Spearman’s rank correlation was
used to analyse the statistical relationship between the
number of analysed specimens per mosquito species and
number of detected host species. Furthermore, only for
most abundant mosquito species (Cx. pipiens pipiens f.
pipiens), the statistical influence of the trapping methods
(BG trap and aspirator), trapping period (early: June,
July; and late: August, September, October), surrounding
area (rural, natural) and year (2015, 2016) on the propor-
tion of bird-, human- or non-human mammal-fed mos-
quito specimens was conducted, using a generalized
linear model for each of the three host groups. A
Gaussian data distribution and identity link was ap-
plied. The full model with the variables trapping
method, trapping period, surrounding area, and year
was tested using backward elimination of variables
based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) with
the R function step. The data for the EVS trap were
excluded because only four specimens of Cx. pipiens
pipiens f. pipiens were collected with this method.
Additionally, the data from the single site with urban
surrounding area were removed for this analysis.
Results
A total of 32,317 mosquito specimens of 28 taxa were
collected in 16 trapping sites. All blood-fed specimens
were selected and analysed. The source of blood meals
for 570 blood-fed mosquito specimens of 20 different
taxa was determined, resulting in the identification of 13
different sources of blood meals (9 mammals including
humans, 3 birds and 1 reptile) (Fig. 2, Tables 1 and 2,
Additional file 1: Table S1). On average, 25.1% of the
specimens per sample collected with the aspirator were
blood-fed. This proportion was lower for the BG trap
(14.7%) and EVS trap (0.5%) (Additional file 2: Table S2).

(s.l.), while the EVS trap was more efficient in catching
Cx. sitiens and the aspirator more efficient in catching
Cx. theileri (Additional file 3: Table S3). No blood-fed
specimens were trapped with the gravid trap. Mosquito
specimens were predominantly caught in July (189 speci-
mens), August (205 specimens) and September (106
specimens), while a few samples were also collected in
June (48 specimens) and October (22 specimens). Of all
blood-fed mosquitoes caught, five mosquito species
accounted for more than 85.8% of all collected speci-
mens: Cx. pipiens pipiens f. pipiens (305 specimens,
55.7% of all mosquito specimens), Cx. theileri (60,
10.9%), Cx. sitiens (51, 9.3%), Cx. perexiguus (29, 5.3%)
and Anopheles superpictus (25, 4.6%) (Table 1). The
other mosquito taxa were much rarer and represented
by one to 15 specimens. As expected, the total number
of detected sources of blood meals had a statistically
positive correlation with the number of analyzed speci-
mens (rS = 0.93, P < 0.001): Cx. pipiens pipiens f.
pipiens (305 specimens, 10 host species), followed by
Cx. sitiens and Cx. theileri (60 and 51 specimens,
respectively, each with 7 host species) and Cx. perexi-
guus and An. superpictus (29 and 25 specimens, re-
spectively, each with 6 host species).
Hosts from three or four host groups were determined
for eight mosquito species (40.0% of all species, Table 1).
For the four most abundant species, non-human mam-
mals (229 specimens, 41.8% of all mosquito specimens)
and humans (224, 40.9%) were the most commonly de-
tected blood meal source, followed by birds (93, 17.0%)
and reptiles (2, 0.4%) (Table 2, Fig. 2, Additional file 4:
Table S4). The most common non-human mammals
were cattle (Bos taurus, 171 specimens), dogs (Canis
lupus, 29 specimens), and sheep (Ovis aries, 16 speci-
mens), followed by five species with less than ten de-
tections each (Equus asinus, Chiroptera, Capreolus
capreolus, Rattus norvegicus, Sus scrofa). With more
than 70 records each, humans (Homo sapiens; 224 mos-
quito specimens, 40.9% of all mosquito specimens; de-
tected in 85% of all mosquito species), cattle (171,
31.2%, 60%) and ducks (Anas spp.; 75, 13.7%, 45%) were
the most common blood meal sources. The four most

abundant mosquito species had similar host-feeding
patterns, except a relatively high proportion of birds
for Cx. pipiens pipiens f. pipiens (23.2% of detected
blood meal sources) and a high proportion of non-hu-
man mammals for Cx. theileri (73.4%). In addition, 11
mosquito species (55%) fed on both, humans and cattle.
No mixed blood meals were detected. The relative pro-
portion of the host-groups did not considerably change
in the course of the year for the four most abundant
species (Fig. 3, Additional file 5: Figure S1). There were
apparent differences between the host-feeding patterns
between the three trapping methods (Table 3, Add-
itional file 6: Table S5). For example, the proportion of
human-fed mosquitoes were higher for the BG trap
compared with the aspirator for Cx. pipiens pipiens f.
pipiens and Cx. perexiguus. In contrast, a high propor-
tion of non-human mammal blood sources were found
for the aspirator for the four most abundant mosquito
species, but it has to be kept in mind that the aspirator
was also used more frequently in the rural areas (Add-
itional file 1: Table S1). However, for Cx. pipiens pipiens
f. pipiens, trapping period, trapping method, surround-
ing area, or year had no statistically significant impact

out any variables had the lowest AIC value.
Discussion
Field data on the host-feeding patterns provide import-
ant information to determine the potential vector cap-
acity of hematophagous arthropods [7]. In the present
study, 20 mosquito taxa were collected in Iran, which
fed on nine mammal species, three bird species and
one reptile taxon. The mosquito species had a signifi-
cant overlap in their host-feeding patterns, i.e. most of
the species shared one or more host species. As previ-
ously highlighted in similar studies from Switzerland,
Germany and the USA [17, 27, 33], most of the ana-
lysed mosquito taxa fed on humans. In addition, only
humans and cattle comprised nearly three-quarter of all
analysed blood meals and 55% of all mosquito taxa fed
on both host species. There are two potential explana-
tions for the observed host similarities between the
mosquito species: a strong overlap in the host prefer-
ence or a relative high abundance of the selected hosts
present in the available host communities. It can

therefore
be
deduced
that
in
comparison
to
the
species-specific vector competence or host availability,
species-specific host choices are probably not the most
important factor driving pathogen transmission.
However, from an epidemiological point of view,
feeding on multiple host species is more important to
determine the vectors capacity for zoonotic pathogens.
Exclusively based on the host-feeding patterns, most of
the mosquito species must be considered as potential
vectors of zoonotic pathogens [34]. The four most
common mosquito species in this study (Cx. pipiens
pipiens f. pipiens, Cx. theileri, Cx. sitiens and Cx. perex-
iguus) all fed on humans, non-human mammals and, to
a certain extent, birds. Therefore, these species must be
classified as potential vectors for pathogens transmitted
between mammals (e.g. filarial nematodes [3]) and be-
tween birds and mammals (e.g. WNV [35] or SINV
[36, 37]). Domestic mammals and particularly cattle
were the second most commonly detected sources of
blood meals after humans. This demonstrates the po-
tential transmission risk of zoonotic pathogens by these
four Culex species, e.g. cattle are potential reservoirs of
the Rift Valley fever virus [38] or Batai virus [39, 40].
However, the host feeding patterns are only one part of
vector capacity. The actual potential of a species as a
vector has to be further tested using vector compe-
tence studies, i.e. to verify the ability of a mosquito to
acquire a pathogen and subsequently transmit it to a
new host.
The host-feeding preference of the most abundant
species, Cx. pipiens pipiens f. pipiens, is commonly
described
as
predominantly
ornithophilic
[41–44].
Although the species had the highest proportion of
birds as source of blood meal in this study, there is
increasing evidence from laboratory experiments [45]
and field studies [17, 46] that the species regularly
feeds on mammals. Indeed, in the present study, this
species was found to blood-feed on humans and
non-human mammals, as well as birds. One possible
explanation for the reports of different host-feeding
patterns of the species could be the composition of
the host communities in the different study areas,
e.g. Cx. pipiens (s.l.) feeding preference was found to
be directly influenced by the change of host abun-
dance during the course of the year, which also af-
fected the epidemiology of pathogens [47, 48]. Due
to
the
wide
distribution
and
abundance
of
Cx.
pipiens pipiens f. pipiens in Iran [3, 19], the species
must be considered as both a potential enzootic and
bridge vector for pathogens predominantly transmit-
ted between birds [49, 50], e.g. SINV [1] or WNV
[2] already circulating in the country. However, the
same species is also a potential vector of pathogens,
which can spill-over from non-human mammals to
humans, e.g. filarial nematodes (Dirofilaria immitis
or Setaria labiatopapillosa) also present in Iran [3].
This study gives a preliminary understanding of the
vertebrate hosts of several mosquito species in Iran. Fur-
ther studies should focus on an extended spatial-tem-
poral sampling in other areas of the country, covering
different biotopes to give a thorough understanding of
the host-feeding patterns of the native mosquito fauna.
In addition, as discussed in a previous publication [17],
mosquitoes can have a high plasticity and host-feeding
patterns therefore probably only reflect a high similarity
in the host preference or availability of hosts [10].
Therefore, information on the local host communities is
required to understand the spatial-temporal variability of
host-feeding patterns, which was found to directly re-
spond to the seasonality of the host abundance and thus
also affecting pathogen epidemiology [48, 51]. Finally,
the analyzed specimens originated from a study on the
distribution of mosquito-borne pathogens not directly
focused on systematically evaluating the host-feeding--
patterns of mosquitoes [21]. The carbon dioxide baited
traps used in this study target host-seeking females, but
not blood-fed or engorged specimens. In addition, previ-
ous studies have already discussed the impact of differ-
ent
trapping
methods
on
the
collection
of
adult
mosquitoes [52] and the analysis of blood-feeding pat-
terns in general [17, 44]. Although statistically not sig-
nificant, this study indicated an impact of the trapping
method on the identified host-feeding patterns, e.g. hu-
man blood sources were more frequently caught with
BG trap compared with the aspirator for Cx. pipiens
pipiens f. pipiens and Cx. perexiguus. Our study did not
apply the same trapping effort per trapping site. This
probably prevents a comprehensive understanding of the
observed host-feeding patterns. For example, the here
presented study is significantly biased by an association
between the detected host species and the trapping site
(Additional file 7: Table S6). Therefore, standardizing
data collection methods and sampling effort, with a var-
iety of methods in each trapping site, would mean a
more representative characterization of the hosts facili-
tated by different mosquito species could be acquired.
Conclusions
In the Middle East including Iran, the analyses of host-
feeding patterns of mosquitoes is a highly neglected field
of research. The analyses of blood-fed Iranian mosquito
species indicated a clear overlap and aggregation of host
taxa, i.e. most mosquito species fed on different host
groups (humans, mammals and birds) with the highest
frequencies for humans and cattle. This information sug-
gests that most species can potentially transmit patho-
gens between mammals as well as between mammals
and birds, which might be the result of a similar host

selection or a high dependence on the host availability.
In conclusion, pathogen transmission cycles are probably
significantly influenced by the local composition of the
host communities. Furthermore, contrary to the fre-
quently published opinion, Cx. pipiens pipiens f. pipiens
was not predominantly ornithophilic, but fed on a di-
verse range of vertebrate hosts including humans, non-
human mammals, birds and even reptiles, highlighting
the species’ role as a potential enzootic and bridge vec-
tor. Therefore, the breeding sites of this species (e.g.
artificial water bodies) should be included in control
measurements for currently circulating pathogens in
Iran. In addition, the present study also demonstrates
the relevance of studies on the host-feeding patterns
of mosquitoes to understand one of the most import-
ant parts of species vector capacity and pathogen
transmission cycles.
