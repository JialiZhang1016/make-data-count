DNA sequence data from the low-copy nuclear genes waxy (GBSSI) and leafy were 
compared with plastid and ITS sequence data from prior studies to reconstruct 
phylogenetic relationships in the Wintergreen Group of tribe Gaultherieae (Ericaceae). 
We conducted phylogenetic analysis with 102 species that includes representatives 
of all 15 major clades previously identified within the Wintergreen Group and that 
together span its circum-Pacific distribution. Results yielded two distinct homeologous 
copies of waxy for two of the clades, each in widely separated parts of the tree. It also 
yielded two copies of leafy for one of the clades; only one copy of leafy was found for 
the other clade, but it was placed in the same major clade as its waxy counterpart 
and well away from its placement in a prior plastid analysis. A combined four-locus 
(waxy, leafy, ITS and plastid data) phylogenetic analysis of all available relevant data 
placed the copies of each of the clades in two distinct positions in the phylogeny with 
strong overall statistical support. In combination with evidence from morphology, 
reproductive biology and cytology, the results suggest that these clades arose through 
allopolyploid hybridization between lineages deep in the phylogeny but relatively close 
geographically. This finding confirms previous assumptions that hybridization has 
played an important role in the evolution of the Gaultherieae.

Introduction
The ‘Wintergreen Group’ of tribe Gaultherieae (Ericaceae) comprises three genera 
(Diplycosia Blume, Gaultheria Kalm ex L. and Tepuia Camp) and ca 280 species with 
a combined circum-Pacific distribution encompassing a wide range of ecoregions and 
elevations. Two of its species (G. leucocarpa Blume and G. procumbens L.) have served 
as a primary natural source of wintergreen oil (methyl salicylate), used widely in the 
confection and pharmaceutical industries (Foster and Johnson 2008). Phylogenetic 
Allopolyploidy in the Wintergreen Group of tribe Gaultherieae

Research

studies of the Gaultherieae based on DNA sequence data 
have been conducted under various taxon and gene region 
sampling schemes (Powell and Kron 2001, Kron et al. 2002, 
Bush et al. 2009a, b, Lu et al. 2010, Fritsch et al. 2011). 
The results of these studies are consistent in supporting the 
monophyly of the Wintergreen Group, with the putative 
synapomorphies of fleshy fruits and the presence of methyl 
salicylate (Powell and Kron 2001, Bush et al. 2009a). They 
are also consistent in the nested placement of Diplycosia and 
Tepuia within Gaultheria, rendering the latter paraphyletic. 
The most recent phylogenetic study of the group analyzed six 
genic regions (nuclear ribosomal (nr) ITS, and plastid matK, 
ndhF, rpl16, trnL-trnF and trnS-trnG) with parsimony (MP), 
maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI), 
yielding 15 major clades with strong support (Fritsch et al. 
2011, Table 1). The analysis challenged many aspects of the 
most recent global classification of Gaultheria (Middleton 
1991a): out of 10 sections and 21 series total, monophyly 
was supported for only one of the five sections and four of the 
11 series that either have more than one species or for which 
more than one sample was included.
Hybridization has been thought to have played a criti­
cal role in the evolution of the Wintergreen Group, par­
ticularly in Gaultheria (Sleumer 1952, Baas 1985, Franklin 
1964, Middleton and Wilcock 1990, Middleton 1991b, 
Luteyn 1995a, b). The chromosome numbers for species in 
the Gaultherieae are 2n = 22, 24, 26, 36, 44, 48, 66, 88 and 
~96, and the numbers are usually species-specific, indicat­
ing that polyploid speciation commonly occurs in the group 
(Goldblatt and Johnson 1979, Middleton and Wilcock 
1990). The strongly conflicting placements recovered for 
some species in nuclear versus plastid trees have been inferred 
to have resulted from geographically localized reticulation 
(hybridization or introgression) at shallow phylogenetic levels 
(Lu et al. 2010, Fritsch et al. 2011). However, ITS sequence 
data yielded a poorly resolved tree in Fritsch et al. (2011), 
and thus it was thus not clear whether low support for some 
clades in the combined nuclear and plastid analysis resulted 
from reticulation events, weak phylogenetic signal, or both. 
Furthermore, whether polyploidy in the Wintergreen Group 
is through autopolyploidy, allopolyploidy, or both, has not 
previously been explored.
Further sampling of loci from the nuclear genome could 
help to increase the resolving power of the data for phyloge­
netic reconstruction and assess the frequency, pattern and sig­
nificance of reticulate evolution in the Wintergreen Group. 
Single- and low-copy nuclear genes often evolve more rapidly 
than plastid and nuclear ribosomal gene regions and there­
fore offer a rich source of potentially informative data for 
phylogenetic reconstruction (Sang 2002, Zhang et al. 2012, 
Zimmer and Wen 2015). Because they are biparentally inher­
ited and less susceptible to concerted evolution than nuclear 
ribosomal genes, low-copy nuclear genes also have the poten­
tial to reconstruct allopolyploidization (Sang 2002). Two 
low-copy nuclear loci, waxy (the granule-bound starch syn­
thase gene, i.e. GBSSI, functioning in the synthesis of amy­
lose; Mason-Gamer et al. 1998, Peralta and Spooner 2001) 
and leafy (one of the key regulatory genes involved in the 
formation of the floral meristem; Frohlich and Meyerowitz 
1997), have been widely used in phylogenetic analysis. 
Waxy has provided phylogenetic resolution in both diploid 
(Clark et al. 1991, Wang et al. 1990, 1999) and polyploid 
(Smedmark  et  al. 2003, Mason-Gamer 2004, Winkworth 
and Donoghue 2004, Fortune  et  al. 2008, Rousseau-
Gueutin et al. 2009) plant groups. Leafy has also proven use­
ful for phylogenetic reconstruction at the interspecific level 
(Nishimoto  et  al. 2003, Oh and Potter 2003, Grob  et  al. 
2004, Kim et al. 2008). Bush et al. (2009b) used waxy and 
leafy in combination with ITS data and several plastid gene 
regions to reconstruct the phylogeny of the Australian/New 
Zealand species of Gaultheria, finding that including the data 
from waxy and leafy increased phylogenetic resolution for 
this clade, thus demonstrating that these regions can likely 
provide phylogenetically informative sequence variation at 
deeper levels in the Wintergreen Group.
Here we investigate the interspecific relationships of the 
Wintergreen Group with DNA sequence data from waxy 
and leafy and compare and combine results with those from 
prior data from the ITS region and five plastid regions (rpl16, 
matK, ndhF, trnL-trnF and trnS-trnG; Fritsch et al. 2011).

combined four-locus analysis in the present study. Clades represented by a single sample are indicated as N/A. –, not sampled.

We assess the potential of waxy and leafy for yielding a more 
resolved phylogeny and, on the discovery of duplicated cop­
ies of these genes in one species and one entire clade, use the 
results to examine the allopolyploid origin of these entities.
Material and methods
We used 117 accessions of 113 species in the analyses (newly 
obtained data from waxy and leafy referring to 114 accessions 
of 110 species, Supplementary material Appendix 1). The 
sampling covers all 15 major clades recognized in the most 
recent phylogenetic framework of the Wintergreen Group in 
Fritsch et al. (2011). For clarity in discussing clade relation­
ships within Gaultheria, we use newly created informal clade 
designations (Table 1) as substitute for those in Fritsch et al. 
(2011), who employed names based on the most recent global 
classification of Gaultheria (Middleton 1991a) as modified 
to accomodate monophyly. All clades corresponding to other 
genera were left as is. We sampled 3/3 species of Amblyandra, 
5/9 species of Buxifolia, 1/1 species of Chamaephyta, 2/3 
species of Chiogenopsis, 18/~121 species of Diplycosia, 1/1 
species of Gaultheria (sensu stricto; s.s. hereafter), 1/6 species 
of Gymnobotrys, 1/1 species of Gymnocaulos, 23/~62 spe­
cies of Leucothoides, 14/15 species of Monoanthemona, 5/6 
species of Myrtilloideae, 8/15 species of Pernettya, 14/~24 
species of Shallonium, 4/4 species of Sympodiobotrys and 
2/7 species of Tepuia.  The sample composition is similar to 
that in Fritsch et al. (2011) and covers the circum-Pacific dis­
tribution of the genus, including East Asia, Southeast Asia, 
the Americas and Oceania; an elevation range of 0–4500 m 
a.s.l.; and most of the key morphological characters in 
the classification of Middleton (1991a). Nine samples from 
the other four genera of the Gaultherieae were included 
in the outgroup: 1/1 species of Chamaedaphne Moench, 1/1 
species of Eubotryoides (T. Nakai) H. Hara, 2/2 species of 
Eubotrys Nutt. and 5/5 species of Leucothoe D. Don. One 
accession each of two species from tribe Andromedeae, i.e. 
Andromeda polifolia L. and Zenobia pulverulenta (W. Bartram 
ex Willd.) Pollard, were used to root the trees (Kron et al. 
2002) except in the leafy analyses, for which sequence data 
from these species were not available.
We extracted total DNA from silica gel-dried leaves with 
the CTAB method (Doyle and Doyle 1987) and ampli­
fied, cloned in vivo, and sequenced DNA with the primers 
in Bush et al. (2009b). We performed PCR amplification, 
clean-up and DNA sequencing as in Fritsch et al. (2011). 
We used the waxy region between exons 9 and 11 out of 
13 translated exons (Mason-Gamer et al. 1998, Peralta and 
Spooner 2001) and the leafy intron region between exons 2 
and 3 (2i3), as in Bush et al. (2009b). The PCR primers are 
from Mason-Gamer et al. (1998) and Peralta and Spooner 
(2001) for waxy, and Frohlich and Meyerowitz (1997) for 
leafy. PCR amplification consisted of a hot start at 95°C for 
10 min; 35–40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for between 
30 s and 1 min, primer annealing at 48–52°C for 1 min, 
primer extension at 72°C for 5 min, and a final extension at 
72°C for 7 min. Sequencing was performed at the Bowman 
Grey Technical Center, Wake Forest Univ., NC, USA, on an 
ABI 377 automated sequencer.
Although waxy and leafy have been recognized as 
single-copy genes in many dicots (Mérida  et  al. 1990, 
Wang  et  al. 1999, Oh and Potter 2003), multiple cop­
ies have been detected in some species of the Ericaceae 
(K. Kron, unpubl.) and perhaps for waxy in Gaultheria 
tasmanica (Hook. f.) D.J. Middleton of the Wintergreen 
Group from Australia and New Zealand (Bush  et  al. 
2009b). We therefore conducted in vivo cloning proce­
dures for both waxy and leafy. We followed the procedure 
of Bush  et  al. (2009b), using the Topo Cloning Kit for 
Sequencing (Invitrogen), with up to six clones sequenced 
for each taxon. We edited waxy and leafy sequences with 
Sequencher 4.8 (Gene Codes Corp., Inc.).
Clone sequences were selected for further phylogenetic 
analyses with the method of Triplett et al. (2014), in which 
distinct clone types that may be putative homeologs dupli­
cated through allopolyploidy could be visually identified in 
both waxy and leafy. PCR recombinants can occur by homol­
ogous recombination or PCR strand swapping due to the 
unavailability of a nonproofreading DNA polymerase, and 
could potentially increase homoplasy and distort the resulting 
phylogeny. We therefore first identified and eliminated PCR 
recombinants by inspecting the waxy/leafy gene alignments 
as a splits network in SplitsTree4 ver. 4.14.6 (Huson 1998, 
Huson and Bryant 2006) with the NJ distance-based method. 
To minimize the inclusion of sequencing errors, a consensus 
sequence (a single sequence for each sequence type) per sam­
ple was generated in Geneious ver. 8.0.2 (<www.geneious.
com>). Original sequences were ultimately submitted to 
GenBank. We aligned the final consensus sequences with 
MAFFT ver. 6.602b (Katoh et al. 2002), manually adjusted 
the alignment in Se-Alv.2.0a11 (Rambaut 2002), and calcu­
lated the number of variable sites in Mega 6.0 (Tamura et al. 
2013). The sequences were considered to represent different 
homeologs if they clustered in two different major clades.
We conducted separate phylogenetic analyses on the waxy 
and leafy datasets. The waxy dataset comprised 114 clones 
from 104 species, and the leafy dataset comprised 79 clones 
from 76 species. Samples of the Andromedeae were not avail­
able for leafy and so we rooted the leafy tree on the two spe­
cies of Leucothoe sampled, based on prior results that placed 
this genus outside of the Wintergreen Group (Powell and 
Kron 2001, Bush et al. 2009a, Fritsch et al. 2011). We per­
formed ML analyses with RAxML 7.0.4 (Stamatakis 2006) 
using a bootstrap analysis (2000 replicates) simultaneously 
with the ML analysis (option ‘-f a’) under the GTRGAMMA 
model. We performed BI analyses with MrBayes ver. 3.2.1 
(Ronquist  et  al. 2012) on the Cipres Science Gateway 
(Miller et al. 2011; <www.phylo.org>) with 10 million gen­
erations, four Monte Carlo Markov chains (MCMCs), and a 
sampling frequency of 1000. We selected substitution models 
for each genic region by applying the Akaike information cri­
terion as implemented in jModelTest 2 (Darriba et al. 2012). 
The best-fitting model for phylogenetic reconstruction was 
found to be GTR + I + G for leafy, and GTR + G for waxy.

We examined the results with Tracer ver. 1.7 (Rambaut et al. 
2018) to ensure that the analyses reached convergence and 
that the effective sample size of each parameter was > 200. 
We generated a posterior probability (PP) consensus tree with 
the ‘sumt’ option in MrBayes and a burn-in of 10%.
We constructed a four-locus dataset by combining our data 
from waxy and leafy with the six-gene (two-locus, i.e. ITS and 
plastid) data from Fritsch et al. (2011; ITS and plastid rpl16, 
matK, ndhF, trnL-trnF and trnS-trnG; TreeBASE repository 
No. S11331). Combining these data into a concatenated 
dataset allowed the duplicated genes to be placed within a 
more robust phylogenetic framework than by separate waxy 
and leafy analyses, with higher resolution and clade support. 
The dataset consisted of 92 accessions from 90 species from 
all genera of the Gaultherieae and the same two species of 
the Andromedeae as above. The dataset included 85 waxy 
sequences from 81 samples of 79 species in the Gaultherieae 
plus two from the Andromedeae, and 61 leafy sequences from 
59 samples and species within the Gaultherieae.
To maximize bootstrap support within major clades 
and to prevent conflicting data from potentially interfering 
with the deeper-level placements of clades and the dupli­
cated loci (Wagner 1980, Judd et al. 2015), we excluded 22 
accessions from the combined analysis that exhibited topo­
logical conflicts within or among major clades between any 
two combinations of waxy, leafy, ITS or plastid analyses, 
including those found in Fritsch et al. (2011) between ITS 
and plastid trees (no strong conflicts were exhibited between 
waxy and leafy). The conflicts involving these accessions may 
result from hybridization among closely related taxa within 
major clades, e.g. in New Zealand Gaultheria where hybrid­
ization is known to be rampant (Franklin 1964), or among the 
major clades Shallonium and Buxifolia (G. amoena A.C. Sm., 
G. insipida Benth., G. megalodonta A.C. Sm. and G. sclerophylla 
Cuatrec.), although coalescent stochasticity (lineage sort­
ing) could also be involved in some cases. Accessions were 
excluded if either ML BP was <0.80 or PP < 0.95.
We retained Gaultheria procumbens in the combined analy­
sis despite evident data partition conflicts (Fritsch et al. 2011) 
because it is the only species in its section. With this dataset, 
we conducted ML and BI analyses as above. The best-fitting 
models were found to be GTR + I + G for the plastid rpl16 
and trnL-trnF regions, and GTR + G for the other regions.
We used ASTRAL (Mirarab  et  al. 2014) to compare 
the concatenated results with a coalescent-based method 
of combining data partitions. ASTRAL improves on other 
coalescent-based methods in statistical consistency and is 
often more accurate than concatenation with maximum 
likelihood (Mirarab et al. 2014). We used the tree with the 
highest likelihood from each of the four separate ML analyses 
of individual loci as input.
Chromosome number evolution was inferred by trac­
ing chromosome number with parsimony onto a modi­
fied version of the four-locus ML tree in which many of 
the major clades were reduced to single terminals because 
of extensive missing data in species chromosome counts, 
and in which the two allotetraploid clades/species were 
excluded. Chromosome numbers are from Middleton 
and Wilcock (1990). Parsimony analysis was conducted 
with the program Mesquite ver. 3.51 (Maddison and 
Maddison 2018).
Data deposition
DNA sequences newly obtained are deposited in the 
GenBank Nucleotide Sequence Databases, and aligned 
molecular data matrices are available from the Dryad Digital 
Repository: 
< http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.2gh0ht2 > 
(Lu et al. 2019).
Results
The aligned waxy dataset was 560 bp long with 205 variable 
sites (37%), and the leafy dataset was 3950 bp long with 
1162 variable sites (29%). In the analyses of both waxy 
and leafy (Supplementary material Appendix 1 Fig. A1, A2, 
respectively), some species have clones that exhibit two phy­
logenetically distinct sequences, each of which falls into two 
separate parts of the tree corresponding to Gaultheria myrs­
inoides Kunth and Leucothoides. The sequences of these two 
clades represent distinct copies of each of these genes, and 
the clades in which they occur are here arbitrarily designated 
‘copy A’ and ‘copy B,’ with copy A concordant with the place­
ment of these clades in prior plastid analyses, and copy B 
placed in another region of the trees (Fritsch et al. 2011).
For Gaultheria myrsinoides, we recovered two copies 
of waxy from the two accessions sampled of this species 
(Supplementary material Appendix 1 Fig. A1). The two 
accessions with copy A group with each other (BP = 76, 
PP = 0.99) within Pernettya (BP = 89, PP = 1.00), whereas 
the two accessions of copy B group as unresolved within 
Shallonium (BP = 70, PP = 0.84; Supplementary material 
Appendix 1 Fig. A1). Despite several sequencing attempts, 
we were only able to recover one clone type of leafy for 
G. myrsinoides, the placement of which is sister to G. schultesii 
Camp (BP < 60, PP < 0.80) within Shallonium (BP = 99, 
PP = 1.00; Supplementary material Appendix 1 Fig. A2) 
and we thus considered it to be comparable to copy B of the 
waxy gene.
The species of Leucothoides are represented by two distinct 
copies in both waxy and leafy. In the waxy tree, the sequences 
of copy A form a clade (BP < 60, PP = 0.93; Amblyandra 
and three species of Shallonium also group here but with 
low support) within a large clade comprising Buxifolia, 
Gymnocaulos, Pernettya, Chamaephyta, Monoanthemona, 
Myrtilloideae, Shallonium, Sympodiobotrys and Tepuia 
(BP < 60, PP = 0.91; Supplementary material Appendix 1 
Fig. A1). The copy B waxy sequences form a clade (BP = 63, 
PP = 0.80; including Chiogenopsis) that groups with a clade 
comprising Gaultheria s.s., Gymnobotrys and Diplycosia 
(BP = 96, PP = 1.00). Four species (Gaultheria heteromera 
R.C. Fang, G. pseudonotabilis H. Li ex R.C. Fang, G. semi-
infera (C.B. Clarke) Airy Shaw and G. straminea R.C. Fang) 
have sequences placed in both the copy A and copy B clades.

One species of Leucothoides, G. hookeri C.B. Clarke, has a 
sequence that groups outside of the copy A clade but with 
only weak support (BP < 60, PP = 0.91). Because another 
clone of this species nests within the copy B clade, this 
sequence is likely copy A (BP < 76, PP = 0.80).
Similarly, leafy sequences of copy A from Leucothoides 
form a clade (BP = 100; PP = 1.00) that is sister to Amblyandra 
(BP = 84; PP = 1.00), and the sequences from copy B form a 
clade (BP = 97, PP = 1.00) that is sister to a clade compris­
ing Gaultheria s.s. and Chiogenopsis (BP = 80, PP = 0.99; 
Supplementary material Appendix 1 Fig. A2). No leafy 
sequences of Leucothoides are placed outside of these two 
clades. Two species (Gaultheria fragrantissima Wall. and 
G. hypochlora Airy Shaw) have sequences placed within both 
the copy A and B clades.
The results of the concatenated four-locus analysis largely 
reflect those of the plastid results in Fritsch  et  al. (2011), 
likely because the tree from the plastid locus exhibits the 
highest resolution and clade support of the four loci used 
(Fig. 1). Bootstrap values of many major clades are at or 
near 100 (ML) or 1.00 (PP; Table 1). Some other strongly 
supported clades are also consistent with those recovered 
in prior plastid/ITS analyses, i.e. the two clades compris­
ing the first divergence within the Wintergreen Group clade 
(BP = 95, PP = 1.00; BP = 98, PP = 1.00); the ‘large-leaved’ 
clade in Leucothoides copy A (Gaultheria pseudonotabilis 
through G. hookeri in Fig. 1; BP = 100, PP = 1.00) and the 
‘small-leaved’ clade of Leucothoides copy A (i.e. G. ser. 
Trichophyllae Airy Shaw, G. dolichopoda Airy Shaw through 
G. ciliisepala Airy Shaw ex P.W. Fritsch & Lu Lu in Fig. 1; 
BP = 100, PP = 1.00); Gymnobotrys + Diplycosia (BP = 100, 
PP = 1.00). The species of Australia (G. appressa A.W. Hill, 
G. hispida R. Br., G. lanceolata Hook. f. and G. viridicarpa 
J.B. Williams) within Monoanthemona also form a strongly 
supported clade (BP = 92, PP = 1.00), as in Bush  et  al. 
(2009b).
The four-locus concatenated results place the two acces­
sions of Gaultheria myrsinoides as sister to each other in both 
copy A and copy B (BP = 100, PP = 1.00), with copy A group­
ing within Pernettya (BP = 100, PP = 1.00) and copy B group­
ing within Shallonium (BP = 99, PP = 1.00; Fig. 1). The copy 
A clade of Leucothoides (BP = 100, PP = 1.00) groups as sister 
(BP = 98, PP = 1.00) to a large clade (BP < 60, PP = 0.96) com­
prising Amblyandra, Buxifolia, Chamaephyta, Gymnocaulos, 
Monoanthemona, Myrtilloideae, Pernettya, Shallonium 
and Sympodiobotrys. The copy B clade of Leucothoides 
(BP = 84, PP = 1.00) groups as sister (BP < 60, PP < 0.80) to 
Chiogenopsis (BP = 97, PP = 1.00) within a larger clade that 
also includes Gaultheria s.s., Diplycosia, Gymnobotrys and 
Tepuia (BP = 95, PP = 1.00).
The results of the coalescent-based analysis from ASTRAL 
largely reflect those from the concatenated dataset, but with 
less overall resolution and slight differences in topology in 
poorly supported regions (Fig. 2). The results of the parsi­
mony analysis of chromosome number yielded an ancestral 
number of n = 11 in the Wintergreen Group, with all other 
numbers derived (Fig. 3). When polyploidy occurs, it does so 
independently among the five major clades in which it has 
been found (Gaultheria s.s., Gymnobotrys, Leucothoides, 
Pernettya and Shallonium).
Discussion
The results from ML and BI applied to either separate or 
combined datasets in the concatenated or coalescent-based 
analyses generally produced similar results; the few topologi­
cal differences lacked strong support (i.e. BP were <0.6, and 
PP < 0.8). The leafy tree is generally more resolved and exhib­
its higher clade support than the waxy tree, likely due to the 
relatively low number of variable sites in the waxy dataset. 
Although there are some topological differences between the 
trees from waxy and leafy, none are strongly supported. The 
results from both of these genes are also generally consistent 
with those of Fritsch et al. (2011) based on ITS and plas­
tid sequence data. The main differences involve the relative 
placements of Amblyandra, Leucothoides, Sympodiobotrys 
and Shallonium. For example, in the concatenated analy­
sis Amblyandra is sister to Leucothoides copy A (BP = 84, 
PP = 1.00) in the leafy tree, whereas it is sister to Shallonium 
in the combined plastid + ITS results (BP = 86, PP = 1.00). 
Also, Sympodiobotrys + Shallonium is sister to the clade 
of 
Gymnocaulos + Pernettya + Chamaephyta + Myrtilloide
ae + Monoanthemona in the leafy tree (BP = 96, PP = 1.00), 
whereas only Sympodiobotrys is sister to this clade in the 
combined plastid + ITS results (BP = 79, PP = 1.00). The basis 
for these conflicts are unclear and may involve rapid clado­
genesis and/or ancient reticulate evolution. The rest of the 
phylogeny is consistent with that from Fritsch et al. (2011), 
particularly regarding the placement of the major clades 
highlighted in that study. On this basis, the classification 
of the Wintergreen Group will be revised to reflect strictly 
monophyletic groups (K. A. Kron, W. S. Judd, P. W. Fritsch, 
L. Lu unpubl.).
Our results yielded two distinct homeologous copies 
of waxy for two of the clades in the Wintergreen Group 
(Gaultheria myrsinoides in Pernettya, and the Leucothoides 
clade), each in widely separated parts of the tree. The place­
ment of one of these copies in each case (copy A) was con­
sistent with the placement of these clades in a prior plastid 
analysis and plastid + ITS analysis (Fritsch et al. 2011). The 
results also yielded two copies of leafy for one of the clades 
(Leucothoides), and again, the placement of one of these 
(copy A) was consistent with that from the prior plastid and 
plastid + ITS analyses. Only one copy of leafy was found for 
the other clade (G. myrsinoides), but it was placed in the 
same major clade as its waxy counterpart and well away 
from its placement in a prior plastid analysis. We thus infer 
that we did not detect copy A of this species for leafy. Our 
combined four-locus analysis with waxy, leafy, plastid and 
ITS data placed the copy A and B clades in robust posi­
tions in the phylogeny, distinct from each other. All other 
clones from the other 13 major clades exhibit no duplicated 
distinct copies.

When combined with evidence from chromosome num­
bers, the formation of distinct clades of gene copies from 
the same species samples has been considered evidence for 
allopolyploidy. In a phylogenetic analysis of Viburnum L., 
Winkworth and Donoghue (2004) found two polyploid 
clades with an additional copy in each of two paralogous waxy 
loci. They proposed that these duplicated clade patterns arose 
through allopolyploidy, and enumerated several angiosperms 
with similar allopolyploid patterns based on waxy data, 
e.g. Elymus L. and Eragrostis Wolf in the Poaceae (Mason-
Gamer 2001, Ingram and Doyle 2003), the Maloideae of 
Rosaceae (Evans  et  al. 2000, Evans and Campbell 2002), 
Geinae of Rosaceae (Smedmark  et  al. 2003), Fragraria L. 
in the Rosaceae (Rousseau Gueutin  et  al. 2009) and the 
Rhamnaceae (Evans et al. 2000) Likewise, as based on dis­
tinct clone types of a non-single copy leafy gene, allopoly­
ploid speciation or a hybrid origin was inferred in Persicaria 
(L.) Mill. in the Polygonaceae (Kim et al. 2008), Neillieae in 
the Rosaceae (Oh and Potter 2005), and Pseudotsuga Carr. in 
the Pinaceae (Wei et al. 2010). Two distinct copies of another 
nuclear low-copy gene (i.e. AAT) was explained by allopoly­
ploidy in the Sideroxyleae of Sapotaceae (Smedmark and 
Anderberg 2007).
Similarly, chromosome numbers combined with phy­
logenetic results have provided evidence for allopolyploidy 
in the Wintergreen Group. Chromosome numbers in the 
Gaultherieae are reported to be 2n = 22 for Chamaedaphne, 
Eubotrys and Leucothoe (base number x = 11), 2n = 36 for 
Diplycosia (x = 9 or 18), and 2n = 22, 24, 26, 44, 48, 66, 88 
and ~96 for Gaultheria (x = 11, 12 or 13), with Eubotryoides 
and Tepuia still unknown (Middleton and Wilcock 1990, 
Goldblatt and Johnson 1979 onwards). The character map­
ping analysis recovered a chromosome number of n = 11 
as the ancestral number in the Wintergreen Group, sug­
gesting x = 11 as the base number for the clade. Among 
the 35 species with chromosome numbers reported in the 
Gaultherieae, those from only five of the 15 major clades of 
the Wintergreen Group are reported as polyploids (Fig. 3). 
Species in Pernettya, including G. myrsinoides and all spe­
cies sampled from Leucothoides, are reported as tetraploids 
(2n = 44). Tetraploids and hexaploids have been reported in 
other species of Pernettya; diploids, tetraploids and hexa­
ploids in Gaultheria s.s. (G. procumbens); tetraploids in 
Gymnobotrys (only G. leucocarpa sampled); and diploids 
and tetraploids in Shallonium (with also one octoploid, 
G. shallon Pursh).

Our study provides strong evidence that tetraploidy in 
Leucothoides arose through a single allopolyploidization 
in the most recent common ancestor of the clade. Waxy 
and/or leafy are both duplicated among the many species of 
Leucothoides, suggesting whole-genome duplication for the 
entire clade, and the phylogenetic placement of the duplica­
tions agrees across genes. The phylogenetic placements of the 
duplications suggest that the clade arose between members 
of the diploid Chiogenopsis clade and a diploid ancestor of 
Leucothoides. Our separate and combined results grouped the 
two species of Chiogenopsis (each with only one copy of waxy 
and/or leafy) with copy B of waxy and leafy of Leucothoides. 
The placements of copy A clones from both waxy and leafy 
are congruent with those in the plastid + ITS tree, whereas 
those of copy B clones are incongruent. Our inference of 
this event is also supported by morphological evidence. 
Gaultheria ser. Trichophyllae was traditionally placed in the 
same morphologically based section as Chiogenopsis in the 
classification of Middleton (1991a), i.e. G. sect. Chiogenopsis 
D.J. Middleton. The species of the two series share several 
characters considered important in the classification of the 
genus, i.e. leaves usually < 1 cm wide, the presence of two 
bracteoles borne apically on the pedicel immediately beneath 
the calyx, solitary flowers and a glabrous corolla, although 
these characters are not widely shared among the rest of 
the species of Leucothoides. Furthermore, the geographic 
distribution of one of the species of Chiogenopsis, i.e. 
G. suborbicularis W.W. Sm., overlaps that of many species 
of Leucothoides in the Himalaya-Hengduan Mountains, 
indicating a potential sympatric area where hybridization 
could have occurred between ancestral elements of these two 
clades. The four-locus phylogeny combined with evidence 
from morphology and geographic distribution suggests that 
an ancestor within the G. suborbicularis lineage is the pater­
nal diploid parent of Leucothoides. The putative maternal 
ancestor remains uncertain or else is extinct, and could be a 
deep-level ancestor in the Wintergreen Group because copy 
A of Leucothoides groups as sister to a large clade compris­
ing most of the other major clades of Gaultheria (Fig. 1). 
Two other clades in this large clade, Sympodiobotrys and 
Amblyandra, have Asian species, and thus an ancestor com­
mon to all the Asian clades could have been involved in the 
hybridization event.
The data also suggest that tetraploidy in Gaultheria myrs­
inoides arose through allopolyploidization. Two copies of 
leafy were detected in different parts of the phylogeny, sug­
gesting whole-genome duplication, although in this case only 
copy B of waxy was detected. The allopolyploid origin of 
G. myrsinoides appears to have involved a diploid ancestor 
in Shallonium, possibly in the lineage of G. erecta Vent. or 
G. schultesii (species that are near or sister to G. myrsinoides 
copy B in the leafy and combined analysis) with the other 
parent an ancestral lineage in Pernettya (Fig. 1). The lat­
ter parent might be the ancestor within the G. mucronata 
(L. f.) Hook. & Arn./G. poeppigii DC. lineage, which forms 
the sister clade of G. myrsinoides copy A. However, both of 
these species are documented hexaploids, and so the immedi­
ate ancestor of these species is unlikely to have formed the 
allotetraploid G. myrsinoides with a diploid parent. Diploidy 
is unknown in Pernettya but might occur in one or more of 
the unsampled species of this clade. Alternatively, the clade 
may have originally been diploid, the polyploidy in these 
species having arisen at least in part though autopolyploidy. 
This is supported by the detection of only a single copy of 
waxy and/or leafy in G. insana (Molina) D.J. Middleton, 
G. mucronata, G. poeppigii and G. pumila (L. f.) D.J. 
Middleton, all from Pernettya. The allopolyploid event 
giving rise to this species would likely have occurred in the 
region of overlap of Pernettya and Shallonium, from central 
Mexico to the central Andes of South America.
Gaultheria myrsinoides exhibits high morphological varia­
tion and a wide geographic range from Mexico to Argentina, 
with many species segregates named but synonymized by 
Luteyn (1995a). It has been found to hybridize with both 
G. erecta in Mexico (with which it was placed as sister in 
the combined analysis) and G. reticulata Kunth in South 
America (Camp 1939, Middleton 1991b). It is unclear from 
our data as to whether one of these species is one of the 
ancestors of G. myrsinoides in its tetraploid evolution. Data 
with higher resolving power could shed more light on the 
ancestry of the species.
The lack of some of the copies of genes otherwise expected 
in Leucothoides and Gaultheria myrsinoides could be due 
either to clone sampling artifact or the loss of the copy, the 
latter of which commonly occurs for one of the homeologs 
of allopolyploids (Doyle et al. 2008). Although it is possible 
that an early whole-genome duplication or polyploid event 
occurred early in the evolution of the Wintergreen Group 
clade followed by the loss of one of the homeologs, this would 
require independent losses throughout the clade to explain 
the recovery of single-copy genes in most of its species, ver­
sus only the two allopolyploid gains in the most recent com­
mon ancestor of the two Gaultheria lineages. Moreover, it 
is unlikely that our sampling would not have recovered one 
of the copies for one of the two genes in other large clades. 
In Leucothoides, for example, we recovered either copy A 
or copy B or both in 15 species of the clade sampled, and 
for other large clades the same should have been expected if 
they were of allopolyploid origin. A fossil-calibrated dating 
analysis of the major clades of the Gaultherieae based on a 
combined plastid and ITS phylogeny yield a time of diver­
gence for Leucothoides crown and stem nodes of ca 8 and 
13 Ma (Lu et al. 2019). This represents a substantial amount 
of time in which gene loss among various species of the clade 
could have occurred. The divergence time of G. myrsinoides 
from its sister species is much more recent at ca 1.3 Ma, but 
still would allow ample time for possible gene loss.
Some of the known polyploid species in the Wintergreen 
Group have only single copies of waxy and leafy, i.e. Gaultheria 
leucocarpa of Gymnobotrys (tetraploid), G. reticulata and 
G. shallon of Shallonium (tetraploid and octoploid, respec­
tively), the species of Pernettya (tetraploid and hexaploid),

and G. procumbens of Gaultheria s.s. (diploid, tetraploid and 
hexaploid). As suggested for Viburnum (Winkworth and 
Donoghue 2004), these polyploids may have arisen indepen­
dently, either through autopolyploidy or after hybridization 
between closely related clades, and therefore the homeologs 
in these species/clades may not have distinct sequences. 
Alternatively, our sample size precluded the detection of the 
other copy in at least some of these species, or one of the two 
homeologs was lost.
The allopolyploid origins for the species within 
Leucothoides and Pernettya are consistent with their geo­
graphic locations in montane regions. The species of 
Leucothoides have their center of diversity in the Himalaya 
and Hengduan Mountains in East Asia, and the latter in the 
Andes of South America. These regions are recognized as 
‘species pump’ areas (Terborgh 1992, Jetz et al. 2004), with 
highly variable environmental parameters involving area, 
elevation, topography and climate (Körner 2004, Tang et al. 
2006, Schwery  et  al. 2015, Yu  et  al. 2018) promoting 
hybridization and subsequent (allo)polyploid speciation 
(Rauscher 2002, Nie  et  al. 2005, Schmidt-Lebuhn  et  al. 
2010).
The ITS sequences in the allopolyploids (ITS sequences 
are all based on direct Sanger sequencing methodology) do 
not exhibit extensive polymorphic sites, suggesting that they 
have been homogenized through the process of concerted 
evolution (Zimmer et al. 1980). The placements of the allo­
polyploids in the ITS tree in Fritsch et al. (2011) generally 
match those based on the plastid results, suggesting that 
homogenization has favored the maternal parent (the ITS 
placement of Gaultheria myrsinoides in that work is with 
Leucothoides but merely with weak support and is effec­
tively unresolved with respect to Pernettya). This nuclear 
region therefore has limited capacity to provide insight 
into polyploid evolution within the Wintergreen Group, 
although it has facilitated the discovery of some species-level 
reticulate evolution in the clade, e.g. the putative hybrid 
origin of G. procumbens (Lu et al. 2010, Fritsch et al. 2011).
Our study has generated the most highly resolved phylo­
genetic estimate of tribe Gaultherieae and the Wintergreen 
Group with the strongest overall clade support, and also 
has provided the first evidence of allopolyploid evolution 
in the tribe. A follow up study could involve restriction-site 
Associated DNA (RAD) tags or target capture with high-
throughput sequencing technology, which effectively over­
come problems associated with the extensive labor involved 
in cloning and Sanger sequencing of multiple-copy nuclear 
genes in polyploid organisms (Qi et al. 2015), and thus can 
address phylogenetic relationships and polyploid origins 
within the Wintergreen Group in more detail.
