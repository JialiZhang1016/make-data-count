Abstract
Introduction: Breast cancer in premenopausal women (preM) is frequently associated with worse prognosis
compared to that in postmenopausal women (postM), and there is evidence that preM estrogen receptor-positive
(ER+) tumors may respond poorly to endocrine therapy. There is, however, a paucity of studies characterizing
molecular alterations in premenopausal tumors, a potential avenue for personalizing therapy for this group of women.
Methods: Using TCGA and METABRIC databases, we analyzed gene expression, copy number, methylation, somatic
mutation, and reverse-phase protein array data in breast cancers from >2,500 preM and postM women.
Results: PreM tumors showed unique gene expression compared to postM tumors, however, this difference was
limited to ER+ tumors. ER+ preM tumors showed unique DNA methylation, copy number and somatic mutations.
Integrative pathway analysis revealed that preM tumors had elevated integrin/laminin and EGFR signaling, with
enrichment for upstream TGFβ-regulation. Finally, preM tumors showed three different gene expression clusters with
significantly different outcomes.
Conclusion: Together these data suggest that ER+ preM tumors have distinct molecular characteristics compared to
ER+ postM tumors, particularly with respect to integrin/laminin and EGFR signaling, which may represent therapeutic
targets in this subgroup of breast cancers.
Introduction
Though only 7 % of all invasive breast cancers are diag-
nosed in women <40 years old [1], breast cancer represents
the most frequent non-skin cancer (30−40 %) among
younger women [2]. Breast cancers in younger women
tend to be associated with poorer survival [2–4], and are
more often diagnosed at a later stage of the disease [5, 6].
Several retrospective cohort studies have examined differ-
ences in clinical biomarkers in premenopausal (preM) and
in postmenopausal (postM) tumors. Age has been shown
to be an independent risk factor even after correction for
stage, treatment, and tumor characteristics [2], and youn-
ger women are more likely to develop tumors with less
favorable prognostic characteristics [6]. Also, young women
with breast cancer are reported to have less favorable
histopathological and survival outcomes as compared to
elderly women [7].
Genomic and molecular alterations play a significant
role in breast cancer biology. The well-known 50-gene
subtype predictor, PAM-50, was developed using micro-
array data to provide prognostic and predictive informa-
tion [8]. However, studies that address the unique
molecular changes in preM and postM by multiple omic
approaches are limited. The most notable study com-
pared DNA copy number and messenger RNA (mRNA)
gene expression data in preM and postM breast cancer
and concluded that transcriptomic changes, more than
genotypic variation, account for age-associated differ-
ences in sporadic breast cancer incidence and prognosis
[9]. Anders et al. analyzed microarray data from 784
early-stage breast cancers to discover gene sets able to
distinguish breast tumors arising in younger women
from tumors of older women [10]. A number of genes

were identified with different expression between breast
cancers in younger and older women. A subsequent up-
date reported that after adjusting for clinical variables,
there were no gene expression differences between the
previously defined age groups [11].
To our knowledge, the effect of aging on molecular
changes in breast cancer has never been comprehensively
examined in multiple omic datasets (gene expression,
methylation, somatic mutation, copy number variation
(CNV) data, etc.). Recently, the establishment of large da-
tabases, which comprehensively characterize large num-
bers of breast cancers, including The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) and Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer
International Consortium (METABRIC), has provided the
opportunity to analyze preM breast cancer and shed light
on the possibility of personalized treatment. We show
here that estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) preM breast
cancer is molecularly distinct from ER+ postM breast can-
cer, including changes in gene expression, methylation,
copy number, and somatic mutation patterns. We ob-
served activation of druggable pathways in preM tumors,
which might represent unique targets in the treatment of
preM breast cancer.
Methods
Data description
Two publicly available datasets, TCGA and METABRIC,
were used in this study. A detailed description of the
data used for this study is presented in Additional file
12: Supplementary data. The number of samples repre-
senting ER+ and ER−preM and postM tumors is pro-
vided in Table 1 and a schematic overview of the
available genomic data utilized is in Additional file 13:
Figure S1. The clinical variables of primary interest were
ER status, menopausal status, stage, age, and survival
(Additional file 1). We used age as a surrogate for meno-
pausal status: the preM and postM groups were defined
as patients with age ≤45 and age ≥55 years, respectively.
To minimize potential misclassifications and to exclude
perimenopausal cases, we did not include patients be-
tween 45 and 55 years of age in the analysis. Institutional
Review Board approval was obtained from the University
of Pittsburgh prior to accessing METABRIC data. No in-
formed consent was required as the data are publically
available.
ER status
In TCGA, ER status was primarily defined by the associ-
ated clinical immunohistochemical analysis (IHC) re-
sults. On examination of the expression data there was
strong correlation between ER IHC and ESR1 expression
(data not shown). In order to include samples with miss-
ing ER IHC information a logistic regression model was
built to impute missing ER status (see Additional file 12:
Supplementary methods). In METABRIC, both ER status
measured by IHC and ER status defined by ESR1 expres-
sion were provided, having high positive correlation
(phi-coefficient = 0.82). For our studies, we used ER sta-
tus as defined by mRNA expression. In both datasets,
there was a higher proportion of ER+ tumor samples in
the postM group compared to the preM group (TCGA: 62
% postM and 14 % preM; METABRIC: 72 % postM and
12 % preM) (Additional file 13: Figure S1).
Stratified analysis of molecular profiling TCGA data
A detailed description of the stratified analysis of the
molecular data is provided in the Additional file 12:
Supplementary methods. Briefly, for gene expression we
fitted a linear model for each gene using the function
lmFit from R package limma [12]. We then computed
moderated t statistics by empirical Bayes moderation of
the standard errors with p values adjusted using the
Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method. For methylation we
performed a two-sample t test for each probe and con-
trolled for false positive results using a false discovery
rate (FDR) of 5 %.

We applied two methods for analysis of CNV data: (1)
gene-level CNV data and (2) segment-level CNV data.
In the first setting, Fisher’s exact test was used to detect
whether CNV was different between ER+ preM and
postM groups for each gene, setting the FDR at 5 %. To
compare regions of amplification and deletion between
ER+ preM and postM groups, CNV data were processed
with GISTIC version 2.0.16gp, to detect regions of sig-
nificant amplification and deletion (q value 0.25). We
used the same GISTIC parameters used by FIREHOSE.
Somatic mutation data in TCGA was analyzed based on
whole-exome sequencing results. We analyzed mutation
data by applying MutSigCV v.1.4. In the TCGA breast
cancer data as of 30 March 2013, RPPA data were avail-
able for 142 proteins (or protein posttranslational modi-
fications) in 233 ER+ tumors. We performed a t test for
each protein, with the FDR set at 5 %.
Pathway analysis
To identify enriched signaling pathways among differen-
tially expressed genes, we applied Ingenuity pathway
analysis (IPA) (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA,
USA, [13]) and DAVID functional analysis [14]. To iden-
tify pathways when simultaneously integrating gene ex-
pression, CNV, somatic mutation data, and methylation
data, we implemented PARADIGM [15], an algorithm
that predicts individual tumor pathway activity by factor
graph. We estimated inferred pathway levels (IPL) for
each entity in superPathway at the individual patient
level. We further performed gene set enrichment ana-
lysis (GSEA) [16] on IPL predictions to identify the
enriched superPathway for preM tumors.
Unsupervised and semi-supervised clustering on
preM ER+ tumors
Methods for unsupervised and semi-supervised clustering
are described in detail in Additional file 12: Supplementary
methods. For unsupervised clustering, we performed hier-
archical clustering, ranking variable genes by interquartile
range (IQR) and using the average linkage algorithm and 1
minus Pearson correlation as the distance measure. The
clustering was performed using the R function hclust and
the heatmap was generated using the function heatmap.3.
To identify robust clusters and assess the stability of the
identified clusters, consensus k-means and hierarchical
clustering was performed, again using the 2,500 most vari-
able genes ranked by IQR. The clustering was performed
using R package ConsensusClusterPlus. We further applied
sparse k-means [17] clustering using R package sparcl.
The 5,000 genes with the largest IQR were selected for in-
put into the sparse k-means algorithm, and we selected
the number of clusters (k) to be 3 and weight summation
(Σiwi) to be 25. The advantage of sparse k-means over
hierarchical clustering is that it performs automatic feature
selection in the algorithm based on sparsity regularization.
In Fig. 4a-c, we applied sparse k-means to TCGA, used
the selected features to validate in METABRIC and then
compared the survival differences across clusters.
The above described unsupervised clustering approach
does not consider survival information in the cluster
formation for risk prediction. Thus, we applied a semi-
supervised approach in the METABRIC study to con-
struct survival-associated clusters for risk prediction of
future patients [18]. We fitted a Cox proportional hazard
model for each gene and tested for the influence of gene
expression on survival outcome. We selected genes
whose expression significantly associated with survival
(q value <0.01 after BH adjustment and absolute coeffi-
cient >1). We then used this set of genes to perform the
k-means algorithm. A 10-fold cross-validation approach
was used to avoid overfitting of the data. Additional details
of the clustering approach are provided in Additional
file 12: Supplementary methods.
Results
Differences in gene expression comparing preM and
postM breast cancer
Here we set out to understand differences in molecular
make-up between preM and postM breast cancer, start-
ing with the analysis of differential gene expression (DE).
As a first step, we performed principal component ana-
lysis (PCA) of RNA-seq data (Fig. 1a) and Agilent micro-
array data (Additional file 13: Figure S2A) from normal
and breast cancer samples in TCGA. Normal and tumor
samples were separated by the first principal component
(PC), while ER+ and ER−tumor samples were separated
by the second PC (Fig. 1b, Additional file 13: Figure S2A).
PreM and postM patients were not separated by the first
two PCs. Further, the third PC did not separate preM and
postM patients (data not shown). Similar results were ob-
tained when using methylation data (Additional file 13:
Figure S2B).
We used DE analysis to compare gene expression data
in preM and postM tumors, stratified by ER status. Ana-
lysis was performed using RNA-seq and Agilent micro-
array data with a focus on RNA-seq data due to the
larger number of samples. RNA-seq data were available
on 612 preM and postM ER+ tumors and ER– tumors
(ER+, number of preM:number of postM = 109:372, and
ER–, number of preM:number of postM = 37:94). For ER+
tumors, we found a total of 1,609 and 564 DE genes in
RNA-seq data (Fig. 1b) and Agilent array data (Additional
file 13: Figure S3A), respectively (gene lists are provided
in Additional file 2). The overlap (Additional file 13:
Figure S3B) of 301 genes between RNA-seq and Agilent
microarray data was statistically significant (p <0.0001).
Adding a restriction to fold change (>1.5 or <0.5) decreased
the number of DE genes to 178 (89.3 % overexpressed in

preM) in RNA-Seq data. The top overexpressed genes in
preM tumors were AREG, TFPI2, AMPH, DBX2, RP5-
1054A22.3, and KLK5, and the genes with significantly
lower expression in preM were ESR1, CYP4Z1, and
RANBP3L, FOXD2, and PEX3. In contrast to ER+ tumors,
no DE genes were detected when comparing preM and
postM ER– tumors.
Because of the influence of sample size on DE analysis,
and the difference in the size of the preM and postM
groups, we conducted an analysis using a subsample of
ER+ preM and postM tumors of the same size as in the
ER– tumors. We again detected a statistically significant
number of genes DE between preM and postM in ER+
but not in ER– tumors (data not shown). During the
subsampling (n = 100), we identified 28 genes that were
consistently detected in more than 10 subsample tests,
and 2 genes (AREG and ESR1) were detected as DE in
more than 50 subsample tests. Due to the lack of signifi-
cant differences between ER– preM and postM tumors,
our subsequent analyses focused on ER+ disease.
Differences in methylation, CNV, somatic mutation and
proteomics comparing preM and postM ER+ breast cancer
To determine significant differences in methylation be-
tween preM and postM ER+ breast tumors, we analyzed
methylation data from TCGA. A total of 1,738 probes
(mapping to 818 unique genes) were differentially meth-
ylated after setting the FDR at 5 % and constraining the
absolute difference of the average beta value within the
preM and postM groups to be >0.1 (Fig. 2a). Among them,
48 % of the probes (373 genes) were hypo-methylated in
preM tumors, while 52 % probes (457 genes) were hyper-
methylated in preM tumors. ESR1, MAT2B, CTSS, DDR2
and GALNTL2 were the top genes hyper-methylated in
preM tumors relative to postM tumors. RPL3, FBXL16,
RASGEF1A, KLF6 and MCM7 were the top genes hyper-
methylated in postM ER+ breast cancer (genes lists are
provided in Additional file 2).
We performed a gene-level comparison of CNV be-
tween preM and postM ER+ tumors: 772 genes had dif-
ferent CNV, with SAFB2, TNFSF9, C19ORF70, and HSD

having the most significant changes (Fig. 2b) (gene lists
are provided in Additional file 2). We also performed
GISTIC to identify regions of frequent and significant
aberrations in ER+ preM and postM tumors (Fig. 2c).
GISTIC identified 26 significant amplifications and 33
deletions in ER+ postM tumors, and 18 significant amplifi-
cations and 39 deletions in ER+ preM tumors (Additional
file 3). Inspection of the GISTIC score file in Integrated
Genomics Viewer (IGV) identified nine regions of deletion
(10q26.3, 10q23.31, 11q13.1, 12q24.21, 4q34.3, 6q15,
7p22.3, 7q36.1, 8p21.3) and six regions of amplification
(13q12.3, 16q12.1, 4q13.3, 6q25.1, 6q12, 8q13.1) that were
unique to ER+ postM tumors. Three regions of deletion
(19q13.32, 22q12.3, 22q13.31) and two regions of amplifi-
cation (6p23, 7p21.1) were uniquely identified in ER+
preM tumors.
To identify genes differentially mutated in preM and
postM tumors, we applied the MutSig analysis algorithm.
Genes significantly mutated in preM or postM (q
<0.05) are shown in Additional file 2. Five genes had
statistically significantly different mutation rates be-
tween preM and postM tumors: CDH1 (14.5 % vs 2.9 %),
GATA3 (9.4 % vs 18.6 %), MLL3 (13.3 % vs 4.9 %), GPS2
(0.8 % vs 3.9 %), and PI3KCA (48.7 % vs 37.3 %). The mu-
tation distributions are shown on a diagram of the do-
main structures of the respective proteins (Fig. 2d). After
correction for multiple comparisons only one gene, E-
cadherin (CDH1) remained differentially mutated between
the preM and postM groups. This finding is in agreement
with E-cadherin being frequently mutated in invasive
lobular carcinoma (ILC), which are more common in
older patients. It is possible that additional genes have sig-
nificantly different mutation rates in preM and postM tu-
mors, but that we failed to detect those due to limited
power. Given our sample number of 102 ER+ preM and
384 ER+ postM tumors used for the MutSig analysis, and
assuming mutation rates of 0 % and 2.5 %, or 2.5 % and 10
%, we had 81 % and 83 % power to detect those (detailed
information on power analysis for our study is shown in
Additional file 2).
We determined overall base pair mutation rates, and
found significantly increased rates of mutations in postM
compared to preM breast cancer (0.99 vs 0.67 mutation/
Mb; p <0.0001). We asked whether there was a difference
in the mutations spectra of ER+ preM and postM tumors
and observed an increase in C>T mutations in postM tu-
mors (Additional file 13: Figure S4A) translating to an in-
crease in transitions (Additional file 13: Figure S4B) (preM
43 %, postM 54 %; p <0.0001 chi-square test). Further
examination of the trinucleotide mutation spectra showed
that the increased C>T mutations in postM cancer was
limited primarily to the context of a 5′ T and 3′G
(TCG>TTG) (Additional file 13: Figure S4C). Additionally,
postM cancers were enriched for mutations within TCW
motifs that are associated with APOBEC-induced changes
(preM 27 %, postM 32 %; p <0.001 chi-square test), and
this increase was limited to the context of TCT>TAT
(Additional file 13: Figure S4D).
To compare protein expression and posttranslational
modifications between preM and postM ER+ tumors we
studied RPPA data which were available for 142 proteins
in 233 ER+ tumors at the time of our data lock. The only
significant difference detected was increased expression of
ERα in postM ER+ tumors (Additional file 13: Figure S5
and Additional file 2). Phosphorylation of ERα at Ser118
ranked third and was significant at a nominal level
(p value 0.0016, adjusted p value 0.17).
Identification of signaling pathways enriched in preM ER+
tumors
IPA was used to identify active pathways in preM tu-
mors. We limited the analysis to genes which (1) were
differentially expressed between preM and postM ER+
tumors, and (2) were significantly different between
preM ER+ tumors and normal tissue using the union of
genes identified from both RNA-seq and Agilent micro-
array data (Additional file 4). IPA analysis revealed integ-
rin signaling as the most significant canonical pathway
altered when comparing ER+ preM and ER+ postM tu-
mors (Additional file 5). Pathway enrichment is shown
for both RNA-seq and Agilent microarray data analyzed
individually (Additional file 13: Figure S6) which showed
strong concordance. A potential role for integrin signal-
ing is supported by DAVID functional analysis, which
identified focal adhesion as the most significantly altered
pathway in preM and postM ER+ tumors (Additional
(See figure on previous page.)

file 13: Figure S7). IPA analysis identified the transforming
growth factor (TGF)β pathway as the most significant up-
stream regulator of the transcriptional network in preM
ER+ breast cancer (Additional file 6).
In order to integrate the information-rich data from
multiple omics platforms we implemented PARADIGM
analysis incorporating gene expression, copy number,
and methylation changes to infer pathway-level changes.
Out of 8,674 entities in the database, 1,026 were sig-
nificantly different in preM compared to postM tumors
(p <0.05), with a number of integrin and laminin path-
ways represented among the top 50 entities (Additional
file 13: Figure S8). GSEA [16] on PARADIGM predic-
tions identified enriched superPathways in preM tumors;
65 superPathways were identified as being statistically
significant (Fig. 3, Additional file 7), with integrin signal-
ing being the only pathway identified multiple times
among them (α6β1 and α6β4 integrin signaling; β1 in-
tegrin cell surface interactions; integrin signaling path-
way; agrin in postsynaptic differentiation; β5 β6 β7 and
β8 integrin cell; surface interactions; α6β4 integrin-
ligand interactions; integrins in angiogenesis; integrin
cell surface interactions). A two-sample t test for 19 in-
tegrin/laminin genes showed most significant enrichment
of laminins A1, B1, B2, C1, C2, and C3, and integin β4
and α1 (Additional file 13: Figure S9). In addition to the
integrin pathway, we took note of the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) pathway, which was significantly
activated in preM disease, along with its ligand amphire-
gulin (AREG) (blue stars in Fig. 3).

Validation using METABRIC
To validate our findings from TCGA data, we conducted
an independent analysis using the METABRIC dataset,
containing 130 preM and 1,113 postM ER+ tumors,
and 121 preM and 227 postM ER−tumors. An un-
biased stratified analysis of gene expression data de-
tected 2,542 differentially expressed genes in ER+
tumors, among which 1,322 genes (52.0 %) were over-
expressed in preM ER+ samples (Additional file 8). The
same analysis detected only 146 differentially expressed
genes in ER−samples, confirming our finding from
TCGA data of fewer differences between preM and
postM gene expression in ER−tumors. There was a sig-
nificant overlap between the differentially expressed
genes in TCGA and METABRIC; 31 % and 36 % of
genes over-expressed in ER+ preM and postM in
TCGA, respectively, were also found to be differentially
expressed in METABRIC (p <0.0001).
We next asked whether integrin signaling was among
the
top
differentially
activated
pathways comparing
preM and postM tumors in METABRIC. We applied
IPA and confirmed TGFB1 as the most significantly ac-
tivated upstream regulator (Additional file 9), and integ-
rin signaling among the top 20 canonical pathways.
PARADIGM analysis also identified a number of integrin
and agrin signaling among the top 50 differentially acti-
vated pathways using GSEA (Additional file 10) (β1 in-
tegrin cell surface interactions; α6β4 integrin ligand
interactions; integrin cell surface interactions). Also, as in
TCGA, EGFR signaling was found to be significantly more
active in preM ER+ disease.
Sub-clusters within ER+ preM tumors with poor outcome
Given the striking molecular differences between ER+
preM and postM tumors (Figs. 1 and 2), we applied sev-
eral unsupervised and semi-supervised clustering methods

to analyze ER+ PreM tumors. Unsupervised hierarchical
clustering of ER+ preM tumors from both Agilent and
RNA-Seq platforms (Additional file 13: Figure S10) using
the top 2,500 differentially expressed genes showed two or
more distinct patterns of expression amongst luminal
(Lum)A, LumB and human epidermal growth factor re-
ceptor 2 (Her2)-like tumors. A small fraction of tumors
were classified as basal-like by PAM50, and they clustered
together. Sparse k-means clustering of ER+ preM TCGA
tumor samples with 1,117 selected genes (Additional
file 11) identified three clusters. Clusters 1 (n1 = 36) and
2 (n2 = 29) were mixtures of LumA, LumB and Her2 sub-
type samples, while cluster 3 (n3 = 4) was limited to four
basal-like tumors (Fig. 4a). Data were available in
METABRIC for 976 genes out of the 1,117 genes de-
tected in TCGA expression (Additional file 11) and we
thus used these genes (n = 976), and the same number of
clusters (n = 3) for routine k-means clustering on ER+
preM tumors in METABRIC (Fig. 4b). As observed in
TCGA data (Fig. 4a), such clustering does not simply
group the tumors based on the different molecular
subtypes as defined by PAM50. Importantly, the three
clusters showed very distinct survival in METABRIC
(log-rank test p value 2.6E-5, Fig. 4c), with patients whose
tumors were in cluster 1 showing extremely good out-
come, and patients whose tumors were in cluster 2 having
poor outcomes. The LumA tumors in clusters 1 (n = 33)
and 3 (n = 18) had obvious differences in gene expression
patterns, and to specifically compare these two subgroups,
we examined the difference between them for 6,030
probes that had the largest variation (Additional file 13:
Figure S1). After BH adjustment of p values, 28 of them
remained significant (adjusted p value <0.05 and effect size
>1 or <−1, Additional file 11). The log-rank test compar-
ing survival between the two LumA groups was significant
with a p value of 0.003 (Additional file 13: Figure S10).
We next performed semi-supervised machine learning
of ER+ preM tumors using the METABRIC dataset: 225
genes were selected following a constraint of absolute ef-
fect size >1 and the FDR at 5 %, and k-means clustering
with k = 3 was performed (Additional file 11, Fig. 4d).
The three clusters showed distinct survival rates, with
patients whose tumors fell into cluster 3 having ex-
tremely poor survival (log-rank test p = 3e-11, Fig. 4e).
Finally, we asked how our clustering approach com-
pared to two widely used multigene assays, OncotypeDx
and breast cancer index (BCI) [19, 20] in stratifying risk
of recurrence. To avoid overfitting of the data, a 10-fold
cross-validation approach was applied. As both Onco-
type Dx and BCI classify tumors into three groups (high,
intermediate, and low risk) we selected k = 3 in all algo-
rithms. Similarly, as OncotypeDx uses 21 genes, we set
the number of genes selected in sparse k-means and
semi-supervised clustering to 21. In sparse k-means
clustering, the 21 genes were selected according to the
weight (largest weight), and in semi-supervised cluster-
ing, the 21 genes were selected based on the largest Cox
regression analysis score (Additional file 11). Unsupervised
sparse k-means was the least successful in identifying
different outcomes (log rank p value 0.0481) (Fig. 4f).
Our semi-supervised approach (p = 0.000223) and BCI
(0.000243) identified three different risk groups, with
equally good ability to predict survival. Similar results
were obtained for Oncotype Dx that identified three dif-
ferent risk groups (p = 0.0183). Additional studies need
to be performed using large external datasets in order to
validate our clustering approach, and its use to predict
outcomes in different preM subgroups.
Discussion
In this study we used TCGA and METABRIC to identify
unique genetic and transcriptomic changes in preM breast
cancer compared to postM breast cancer. Differences in
gene expression between preM and postM breast cancer
were found exclusively in ER+ breast cancer. Integration
of multi-omic data analysis identified enrichment of integ-
rin and laminin signaling pathways in preM breast cancer,
and TGFβ was identified as the top upstream regulator in
both TCGA and METABRIC. In addition, EGFR signaling
was activated in preM breast tumors. Semi-supervised
clustering using gene expression data from preM ER+ tu-
mors identified three distinct groups of patients with sig-
nificantly different outcomes.
Using TCGA we only identified significant gene ex-
pression differences in ER+ preM and postM breast can-
cer. None were found in ER−disease. METABRIC also
showed only a very minor difference in ER−preM and
postM despite containing a much greater number of
samples. These findings suggest that the majority of dif-
ferences between preM and postM breast tumors are
driven by altered hormone levels, and thus areonly ob-
served in ER+ disease. Intriguingly, comparing ER+
preM and postM breast cancer, the most altered gene
was ESR1 itself, an observation that has previously
been reported [10]. PreM breast cancer involved hyper-
methylated ESR1, lower levels of ESR1 gene expression,
and lower levels of ER protein expression. Conversely,
postM ER+ breast cancer involved hypo-methylated ESR1,
increased gene expression and increased protein levels.
Prior studies have shown an association between ER ex-
pression and age or menopausal status [21–25], however,
we were unable to find a report on differential ESR1
methylation comparing preM and postM breast cancer.
Intriguingly, one report has shown increased ESR1 pro-
moter methylation in colon cancer, as a function of age
[26]. A preliminary analysis did not reveal significant dif-
ferences in gene expression of classical ER-target genes
between ER+ tumors with hypo-methylated vs hyper-

methylated ESR1 (data not shown), but we plan on per-
forming additional studies, including detailed analyses of
different expression, methylation and roles of ER in breast
cancer. Our future studies will not only address alteration
of ER expression as a function of menopausal status, but
also age. This is critical because age is more strongly asso-
ciated with ER expression than menopausal status in both
TCGA and METABRIC (data not shown). Future studies
should also address whether there is efficacy of combining
epigenetic therapies with endocrine treatment in preM
breast cancer patients, possibly using ESR1 methylation as
a predictive biomarker.
An intriguing finding is the increased activity of integ-
rin and laminin signaling in preM breast cancer. There
are compounds in development targeting this pathway,
including volociximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody
that targets integrin α5β1. To date, studies in renal cell
carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, malignant melanoma and
lung cancer have had promising results [27]. Intetumu-
mab, a monoclonal antibody that targets all members of
the αv integrin family, demonstrated increased overall
survival when combined with cytotoxic therapy in phase
II studies in melanoma [28], but did not improve out-
comes in prostate cancer [29].
In addition, the activation of EGFR signaling in preM
breast cancer is clearly of potential clinical interest.
Other studies have previously identified overexpression
of EGFR [10], and its ligand, amphiregulin (AREG), [9]
in young breast cancer patients. While therapies target-
ing EGFR have been studied in breast cancer, these have
focused predominately on triple-negative breast cancer,
and there have not been previous studies specifically in
ER+ patients [30]. The efficacy results have been mixed,
and neither overexpression of EGFR by IHC, nor assess-
ment of EGFR pathway analysis microarrays has been an
adequate surrogate to predict responsiveness [31–35].
EGFR signaling has been implicated in tamoxifenresis-
tance in preclinical models [36, 37], which could have
significant implications for treatment, and lends further
credence for EGFR pathway overexpression contributing
to worse clinical outcomes in ER+ preM breast cancers.
Furthermore, there is evidence for crosstalk between in-
tegrin and EGFR signaling in both breast [38] and lung
cancer [39], suggesting that successful targeting of these
pathways in preM ER+ breast cancer may require a
multi-pronged approach.
Our somatic mutation analysis using MutSig identified
five genes (CDH1, GATA3, MLL3, GPS2, and PI3KCA)
for which mutation rates were significantly different be-
tween preM and postM tumors. After correction for
multiple comparisons only one gene (CDH1) remained
differentially mutated in the preM and postM groups.
This is consistent with the fact that mutations in CDH1
are found almost exclusively in lobular cancers that are
enriched in older patients. Interestingly, GATA3, an ER-
interacting transcription and chromatin remodeling factor
with a role in luminal cell fate and breast tumorigenesis
[40–42], was recently shown to be overexpressed in preM
breast cancer, and high expression of GATA3 was signifi-
cantly associated with improved survival in preM women,
but not in postM women [43]. Collectively, these data sug-
gest a menopausal status-dependent role for GATA3 in
breast cancer.
As expected, we did find lower overall mutation rates
in preM compared to postM cancer. Increase of muta-
tion rates with age is likely a general effect of oxidative
damage during aging rather than an endocrine response
as a result of menopause. Interestingly, further analysis
of the mutation spectra showed that postM cancers were
enriched for C>T mutations in the context of a 5′ T and
3′G (TCG>TTG), and mutations within TCW motifs
that are associated with APOBEC-induced changes. The
latter changes were limited within the context of TCT>
TAT, an APOBEC motif not typically seen in breast cancer
[44]. Together, the increase in these two mutation types
matches signature 10 from a recent characterization of
trinucleotide mutation context [45]. This signature is
thought to be related to defects in POLE and DNA mis-
match repair genes [44, 46] and thus suggests that defects
in POLE and DNA mismatch repair genes may play a lar-
ger role is postM breast cancers than preM.
In the analysis of gene expression data from TCGA,
we combined the differentially expressed genes detected
in Agilent array and RNA-Seq data. While platform dif-
ferences between microarray and sequencing data has
been a controversial topic [47, 48], we found relatively
good concordance r ¼ 0:70
ð
Þ when examining both plat-
forms performed on the same tumor. Indeed, when we
conducted differential analysis for the two datasets using
the same set of samples, we identified similar pathways
to be activated, with small differences in order/signifi-
cance level.
Semi-supervised machine learning of preM ER+ pa-
tients revealed three groups with strikingly different out-
comes. In part, this is expected because we have used
the survival information when training the classifier. Un-
fortunately we are unaware of another large dataset of
preM breast cancer with gene expression and outcome
data to validate this finding. To avoid overfitting of the
data, and provide a more fair comparison, we performed
a cross-validation approach, and the results suggest that
the semi-supervised machine learning and BCI are
equally good predictors, that seem to outperform Onco-
type Dx. However, additional studies are necessary, and
further research specifically on preM breast cancer will
hopefully identify prognostic tests specific for this type
of breast cancer and will ultimately lead to personalized
therapies.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated unique genomic sig-
natures that can differentiate preM ER+ breast cancer
from postM ER+ breast cancer. They suggest potential
therapeutic strategies such as co-targeting of the lam-
inin/integrin and the EGFR pathways, in addition to
anti-estrogen therapies, that should be studied.
