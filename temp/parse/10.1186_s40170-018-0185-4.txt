Protein interaction and functional data
indicate MTHFD2 involvement in RNA
processing and translation
Costas Koufaris1,2,3 and Roland Nilsson1,2,3*
Abstract
Background: The folate-coupled metabolic enzyme MTHFD2 is overexpressed in many tumor types and required
for cancer cell proliferation, and is therefore of interest as a potential cancer therapeutic target. However, recent
evidence suggests that MTHFD2 has a non-enzymatic function which may underlie the dependence of cancer cells
on this protein. Understanding this non-enzymatic function is important for optimal targeting of MTHFD2 in cancer.
Methods: To identify potential non-enzymatic functions of MTHFD2, we defined its interacting proteins using
co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry and integrated this information with large-scale co-expression
analysis, protein dynamics, and gene expression response to MTHFD2 knockdown.
Results: We found that MTHFD2 physically interacts with a set of nuclear proteins involved in RNA metabolism and
translation, including components of the small ribosomal subunit and multiple members of the RNA-processing
hnRNP family. Interacting proteins were also in general co-expressed with MTHFD2 in experiments that stimulate or
repress proliferation, suggesting a close functional relationship. Also, unlike other folate one-carbon enzymes, the
MTHFD2 protein has a short half-life and responds rapidly to serum. Finally, shRNA against MTHFD2 depletes several
of its interactors and yields an overall transcriptional response similar to targeted inhibition of certain ribosomal subunits.
Conclusions: Taken together, our findings suggest a novel function of MTHFD2 in RNA metabolism and translation.

Background
Altered metabolism is a hallmark of cancer cells that
facilitates their growth and survival [1]. In particular, me-
tabolism of folate-coupled one-carbon groups is repro-
grammed in a wide variety of cancers [2–4]. One-carbon
metabolism is localized into cytosolic, mitochondrial, and
nuclear compartments (Fig. 1) and is required for the syn-
thesis of purines, dTMP, and remethylation of homocyst-
eine to methionine. Extensive evidence now supports that
proliferating cancer cells primarily rely on the mitochon-
drial catabolism of serine via SHMT2 as their main source
of one-carbon groups [5–7], rather than the correspond-
ing cytosolic enzymes. The reason for this preference is
unclear, but may be due to the mitochondrial NADH/
NAD ratio favoring flux in the oxidative direction [8], or
related to the associated reduction of NAD and NADP
[7]. In the nucleus, the formate produced by the mito-
chondrial pathway supports synthesis of dTMP during
DNA replication.
Within mitochondrial folate one-carbon metabolism,
the enzyme MTHFD2 has attracted considerable attention
as a potential target for cancer therapeutics [4, 9, 10], mo-
tivated by a favorable expression profile with high expres-
sion in various human tumor types [4] but low or
undetectable levels in most adult tissues. The normal
function of MTHFD2 may be in embryogenesis, since the
enzyme has long been known to be highly expressed and
essential during embryonic development [11], and a par-
alogous mitochondrial enzyme, MTHFD2L, is expressed
in normal adult tissues [12]. Expression of MTHFD2 in
tumors also correlates with poor disease outcome in

breast cancer [13], liver cancer [14], and acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) [10]. Knockdown of MTHFD2 can in-
hibit cancer cell proliferation in vitro [4, 10, 15] and re-
duces (but does not abolish) tumor growth in vivo [7, 10].
This combination of specific expression in transformed
cells and severe cell phenotypes upon knockdown render
MTHFD2 a compelling potential drug target.
Nevertheless, several observations suggest that the
known metabolic function of MTHFD2 may not be the
sole explanation for its prominent role in cancer. First,
supplementing cultures with formate, the primary product
of the mitochondrial pathway (Fig. 1), fails to rescue
MTHFD2 knockdown cancer cells [4, 10], indicating that
another function of the MTHFD2 protein might be neces-
sary for growth. Second, cells can rapidly adapt to loss of
MTHFD2 by shifting to the cytosolic one-carbon pathway
[7], suggesting a degree of redundancy where flux through
the mitochondrial pathway is not strictly essential. Third,
knockdown of the SHMT2 enzyme, which should also
block the mitochondrial pathway, does not cause cell
death unless glycine is removed [2, 16]. Moreover, the
MTHFD2 protein was recently found to be present in the
nucleus
at
sites
of
newly
synthesized
DNA,
and
over-expression of catalytically inactive MTHFD2 drives
cell proliferation [17], suggestive of a role in signaling/
regulation
rather
than
metabolism.
Knockdown
of
MTHFD2 also affects invasion and migration in vitro [14,
18], although no obvious mechanistic link exists between
one-carbon metabolism and these phenotypes.
Given these observations, it is becoming clear that the
effective targeting of the MTHFD2 protein requires a
better understanding of its role in cancer cells beyond
metabolism.
Although
chemical
inhibitors
of
the
MTHFD enzymatic activity have been reported [19, 20],
different strategies may be required if a non-enzymatic
function of the MTHFD2 enzyme is critical for cancer
cells. For these reasons, we performed an initial investi-
gation
of
the
possible
non-metabolic
functions
of
MTHFD2 by mapping the protein’s interacting partners,
co-expression pattern and the transcriptional responses
to knockdown. Taken together, our results suggest a pre-
viously unrecognized role for MTHFD2 in RNA metab-
olism and translation.
Methods
Cell culture
HCT-116 cell lines were obtained from the National
Cancer Institute. The MTHFD2 CRISPR−/−knockout
(D2-KO) and parental wildtype (WT) HCT-116 cells
were obtained from the lab of Dr. Rabinowitz [7]. Cells
were grown in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with
5% FBS (Life technologies) and Penicillin/Streptomycin
(Gibco) and maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2.
For serum starvation experiments, 200,000 cells were
plated in six-well plates. The next day, the medium was
removed, the cells were washed with PBS and then
serum-free RPMI-1640 medium was added. Cyclohexa-
mide was obtained from Sigma Aldrich (C4859). For the
serum re-stimulation experiments, after 48 h of serum
starvation, wells were washed with PBS and then fresh
RPMI-1640 containing 20% FBS was added to the cells.
Real-time PCR
RNA was isolated from cells using the Qiagen RNeasy mini
kit and quantified using a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectropho-
tometer. The RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using
the VILO cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). The qPCR
reactions were performed in triplicate on a StepOne
Real-Time PCR machine (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using
the
Fast
SYBR
Green
master
mix
(Thermo
Fisher
Scientific). Oligos were ordered from Sigma Aldrich. Primer
sequences are listed in Additional file 1. Relative amounts
of mRNA were calculated using the ΔΔCT method normal-
ized to RPLPO mRNA as a reference.

now known to be present and active in three distinct compartments, the nucleus, mitochondria, and cytosol, linked by the flow of formate between
them. The function of MTHFD2 in the mitochondria is well understood, although its function in the nucleus is not known

Halt protease inhibitors (Thermo Fisher Scientific) just
prior to the extraction. Protein from nuclear and cyto-
solic cellular compartments were fragmented as de-
scribed previously [17]. Protein levels were quantified by
the BCA assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein (10–
20 μg) were loaded per lane of 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The
following primary antibodies were incubated overnight:
anti-MTHFD2 (Proteintech 12270-1-AP); anti-MTHFD1
(Proteintech 6113-1-AP); anti-MTHFD1L (Proteintech
10794-1-AP);

tific MA3-1000); HSP60 (Abcam ab46798); Tubulin
(Abcam ab6046); and COX IV (Abcam 33985). Quantifi-
cation of protein bands was performed using the ImageJ
software and values were normalized to tubulin for each
sample.
Co-immunoprecipitation
WT and D2-KO HCT-116 cells were lysed using the mod-
erate Pierce IP lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with
addition of × 100 Halt protease inhibitors (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). All steps were performed at 4 °C to reduce pro-
tein disassociation. The protein lysate was quantified using
the BCA assay, and 1 or 2 mg of lysate was used for im-
munoprecipitation with no cross-linkage. Immunoprecipi-
tation was performed using two separate anti-MTHFD2
antibodies (Proteintech 12270-1-AP (AP) and Genetex
N1C3 (NC)) or an anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (IgG)
(Santa Cruz). The immunoprecipitation was performed at
4 °C for 2 h using Dynabeads Protein A (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
In-gel digestion and mass spectrometry
Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from Dyna-
beads through a combination of elution buffer and heat-
ing and separated on a 10% SDS gel. In-gel staining of
proteins was performed using the SilverQuest silver
staining kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Protein lanes
were excised manually and in-gel digested using a
MassPREP robotic protein-handling system (Waters,
Millford, MA, USA). Gel pieces were distained twice
with 100 μL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (AmBic)
containing 50% acetonitrile at 40 °C for 10 min. Proteins
were reduced with 10 mM DTT in 100 mM Ambic for
30 min at 40 °C and alkylated with 55 mM iodoaceta-
mide in 100 mM AmBic at 40 °C for 20 min followed
with in-gel digestion with 0.3 μg trypsin (sequence
grade, Promega, Madison, WI, USA) in 50 mM at 40 °C
AmBic for 5 h. The tryptic peptides were extracted with
1% formic acid in 2% acetonitrile, followed by 50%
acetonitrile twice. The liquid was evaporated to dryness,
and the peptides were reconstituted in 10 μL of 2%
acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid. Five microliters of the
samples
was
injected
onto
the
LC-MS/MS
system
(Ultimate™3000 RSLCnano chromatography system and
Q Exactive HF Orbitrap mass spectrometer, Thermo
Scientific). The peptides were separated on an Easy-C18
column, 50 cm (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 55 °C in a
120-min gradient at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. The lin-
ear gradient was from 5 to 26% of buffer B (98% aceto-
nitrile/0.1% formic acid) in 115 min and to 95% of
buffer B in 5 min.
We used data-dependent acquisition with a survey scan
range of 300 to 1650 m/z, at a resolution of 120,000 m/z
and selected up to 16 most abundant features with a
charge state ≥2 for HCD fragmentation at a normalized
collision energy of 26 and a resolution of 30,000 at m/z
200. To limit repeated sequencing, dynamic exclusion of
sequenced peptides was set to 90 s. Thresholds for ion in-
jection time and ion target values were set to 250 ms and
5 × 106 for the survey scans, and 120 ms and 2 × 105 for
the MS/MS scans. Data were acquired using the Xcalibur
software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The spectra were ana-
lyzed using the Mascot search engine v. 2.4 (Matrix Sci-
ence Ltd., UK) using carbamidomethylation (C) as fixed
and deamidation (NQ), oxidation (M) as variable modifi-
cation. The precursor mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm
while MS/MS tolerance was 0.02 Da allowing 2 missed
cleavages. The SwissProt database was used with tax-
onomy limited to Homo sapiens.
In total, we performed 12 Co-IP experiments (for
HCT-116 WT, 4 using AP antibody, 2 using NC anti-
body, and 2 using IgG antibody; for HCT-116 D2-KO, 2
using AP antibody and 2 using NC antibody) followed
by MS analysis. A protein was considered as high confi-
dence if at least two unique peptides were detected in
50% of IP-MS samples for each of the MTHFD2 anti-
bodies used and was not detected in any of the IP-MS
samples from D2-KO cells, nor the IgG isotype control
IP-MS samples.
Protein-protein interaction network
A protein-protein interaction network was extracted
from the STRING database v10.5 [21] using the set of
MTHFD2 interacting proteins identified here. Only ex-
perimental data (e.g., from co-purifications and yeast
two hybrids) imported in STRING from primary sources
were used for constructing the network. Threshold for
connections between proteins was set at medium score
(more than 0.400) as calculated in STRING, and gene
ontology (GO) enrichment was calculated.
Half-life analysis
For half-life analysis, we used publicly available data on
global protein half-life in NIH3T3 cells [22], HeLa, and
C2C12 cells [23]. The list of 1652 proteins involved in
metabolism were obtained from Recon2 [24] model of
human metabolism, of which 596 were measured in
HeLa, 575 in C2C12, and 605 in NIH3T3.

Co-expression analysis
Calculation of gene co-expression was performed using
a clustering-based method, as described previously [17].
Briefly, we analyzed 25,485 genes represented on a var-
iety of microarray platforms for co-expression with
MTHFD2 across 8097 human, mouse and rat data sets
obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).
From the resulting matrix of coexpression scores xgd, we
computed the overall coexpression score wg for each
gene g by simply summing over all data sets d. We se-
lected the 50 data sets showing highest coexpression for
the D2PPI genes by scoring each data set by the
weighted sum
X
g
wgxgd , where g ranges over the 29
genes in the D2PPI gene set; and similarly for the ATF4
gene set (Fig. 3b). Example data sets from GEO (Fig. 3c–f)
were analyzed as deposited on GEO, with no further
normalization. In cases where multiple probes against a
single gene were present on the arrays, the probe with
highest mean signal across all samples was used. Enrich-
ment analysis was done using the GSEA-P statistic [25],
and an enrichment p value was calculated by gene permu-
tation (10,000 permutations). An independent analysis
was made using the SEEK tool (http://seek.princeton.edu)
with default settings [26].
Connectivity Map (CMap) analysis
Expression data from the Connectivity Map (CMap) pro-
ject in Level 5 (signature) GCTX format was obtained
from GEO (accession GSE92742), and data for 99 experi-
ments with five distinct shRNA hairpins against MTHFD2
across 12,328 measured genes was extracted using R
v.3.3.3 and the cmapR package (https://github.com/cmap/
cmapR). Since the three hairpins TRCN0000036550,
TRCN0000036551,
and
TRCN0000036553
exhibited
strongest knockdown on MTHFD2 itself, these were used
for subsequent analysis. Data from the ASC and NPC cell
lines were discarded due to few replicates. The z-scores
for the remaining 9 cell lines were averaged into a final
z-score vector, which was used for enrichment analysis
using the GSEA-P statistic [25]. The genesets examined
were
downloaded
from
ConsensusPathDB
collection
(http://cpdb.molgen.mpg.de/). An enrichment p value was
calculated by gene permutation (10,000 permutations).
Connectivity scores between hairpins targeting three
one-carbon enzymes included in CMap (MTHFD2,
MTHFD1, and SHMT1) and hairpins targeting 3799 ex-
amined genes were analyzed using the CMap online
tools (https://clue.io/cmap). Connectivity scores of more
than 90 or less than −90 were considered as significantly
enriched. Clustering analysis of connectivity scores was
performed using ClustVis [27] with average linkage and
correlation metric. Ribosomal genes were selected for
analysis based on the KEGG ribosome gene set (entry
hsa03010).
RNAi and CRISPR screening data analysis
Global RNAi and CRISPR screening data were per-
formed as part of the Achilles project in 501 and 342 cell
lines respectively [28, 29]. We also examined a second
CRISPR study conducted in 14 AML cell lines [30]. To
identify genes with similar dependencies across exam-
ined cell lines in the RNAi and CRISPR screens, we cal-
culated Pearson’s correlation for MTHFD2 against all
examined genes in both datasets.
Results
Protein interaction partners of MTHFD2
Since a non-metabolic function of MTHFD2 would
likely involve direct physical contact with other proteins,
we decided to first perform co-immunoprecipitation
(Co-IP) of MTHFD2-interacting proteins followed by
mass spectrometry (MS) to identify its binding partners.
To avoid potential artifacts due to unspecific antibody
binding, we chose to perform Co-IP experiments in
wildtype
(WT)
and
CRISPR
MTHFD2
knockout
(D2-KO) HCT-116 cells [7], using two distinct MTHFD2
antibodies, 12270-1AP (AP; Proteintech) and N3C3
(NC; Genetex) as well as an isotype control (IgG) anti-
body (Fig. 2a). We first confirmed by immunoblotting
and IP that the MTHFD2 protein was absent from
D2-KO cells (Additional file 2). Next, we performed
Co-IP followed by SDS-PAGE and silver-staining to ver-
ify the efficient immunoprecipitation of MTHFD2. This
analysis revealed a strong band at the expected size of
MTHFD2,
as
well
as
a
large
number
of
other
immunoprecipitated protein bands (Fig. 2b). In D2-KO
cells, the MTHFD2 band was not detected, but other
protein bands were still observable, presumably due
to
non-specific
binding
of
the
antibodies
used
(Additional file 2). Detected peptide fragments in all ex-
amined Co-IP lysates are listed in Additional file 3.
Reassuringly, MTHFD2 itself was reliably identified from
WT cells using both antibodies and strongly decreased in
the D2-KO lysates (Fig. 2c).
We defined high-confidence MTHFD2-interacting pro-
teins as those that were reliably detected by Co-IP in WT
but not D2-KO cells, using both the AP and NC
antibodies, and were also absent from IgG lysates (Fig. 2a;
Methods).
With
these
criteria,
we
identified
29
MTHFD2-interacting proteins, from here on referred to
as the D2PPI gene set (Table 1). The majority of these pro-
teins have been reported to localize to the nucleus,
consistent with previous evidence that MTHFD2 is also
a
nuclear
protein
[17].
While
two
mitochondrial
RNA-binding proteins were present (LRPPRC; HSPA9),
we found no other one-carbon enzymes among the
Koufaris and Nilsson Cancer & Metabolism  (2018) 6:12 
Page 4 of 14
D2PPI proteins. We did detect MTHFD1 using the AP anti-
body, but this protein was found in D2-KO cells as well, in-
dicating that this interaction is due to unspecific binding.
Hence, MTHFD2 does not appear to participate in the previ-
ously reported nuclear thymidylate synthesis complex [31].
Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of these proteins confirmed
a highly significant enrichment of RNA binding proteins
(24/29 proteins; q < 10−20) (Fig. 2d; Additional file 4) and
that a large fraction of these proteins were also nu-
clear (Fig. 2e). To determine if the D2PPI proteins

belonged to any known complexes, we extracted a
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network over these
29 proteins from the STRING database [21]. We ob-
tained 47 physical interactions, which is two times
more than expected by chance (p < 10−7); hence, the
D2PPI proteins are likely part of previously known
protein complexes, including the small ribosomal sub-
unit proteins (four RPS proteins), RNA processing
proteins
(several
hnRNP
family
members;
SF3B3;
ILF2), protein chaperones (several heat shock pro-
teins; NPM1), and histone/DNA repair proteins (three
histone proteins; XRCC6; RPN1) (Fig. 2f). Hence, the
proteins
shown
here
to
directly
interact
with
MTHFD2 indicate a role for the protein in metabol-
ism and translation of RNA.
Co-expression analysis of MTHFD2 and interacting proteins
To systematically assess if the D2PPI proteins indeed
share a common function with MTHFD2, we next asked
whether their mRNAs are also frequently co-expressed
with MTHFD2. We have previously shown that frequent
co-expression across diverse experimental conditions is
highly predictive of closely related biological function
[32, 33]. Using a previously described method [17], we
scored 25,845 genes for co-expression with MTHFD2 in
8067
human,
rat,
and
mouse
microarray
datasets
(Additional file 5). Remarkably, D2PPI gene set was clearly
enriched for coexpression with MTHFD2 (p = 0.003,
permutation test), with 13 of 29 of genes within the 95th
percentile of coexpression scores (Fig. 3a). An exception
was the histone proteins H3F3A, HIST1H3A, HIST3H3,

and HIST2H3A that did not exhibit co-expression with
MTHFD2; however, these proteins were not well-repre-
sented on the microarrays used, so this result may reflect
low power to detect coexpression. An independent ana-
lysis of 3356 human gene expression datasets using the
SEEK gene co-expression analysis tool [26] gave similar
results (Additional file 5). To investigate factors that might
drive the observed coexpression of the D2PPI gene set, we
identified specific gene expression data sets where this set
was coexpressed (Fig. 3b, Additional file 6). Among the
top scoring data sets were several tumor gene expression
studies, where expression varied between subtypes; for
example, in one leukemia study, highest expression was
found in T-ALL and lowest in AML subtypes, suggesting
specific disease contexts where the D2PPI proteins may
be relevant (Fig. 3c). We also noted a concerted induction
of the D2PPI proteins in stimulated T cells (Fig. 3d), in
line with previous observations of MTHFD2 induction in
this setting [4], and also suppression of D2PPI genes in
HCT-116 cancer cells in response to treatment with a
CDK
inhibitor
(Fig.
3e).
These
data
indicate
that
MTHFD2
and
the

genes
are
frequently
coexpressed and responsive to mitogenic stimuli and

As previously shown [17], a set of ATF4-responsive
mRNAs
involved
in
amino
acid
metabolism
and
aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis, including the mitochondrial
folate-coupled enzymes SHMT2 and MTHFD1L, was
also strongly co-expressed with MTHFD2. However, we
found that these genes co-express with MTHFD2 in dif-
ferent conditions than the MTHFD2-interacting proteins
(Fig. 3b, Additional file 6), suggesting that the underlying
mechanism is different. For example, the mitochondrial
enzymes were induced in contexts of amino acid starva-
tion, possibly reflecting the involvement of this pathway
in amino acid synthesis, while the D2PPI genes were not
(Fig. 3f). In summary, the D2PPI genes are co-regulated
with MTHFD2 in specific biological conditions, provid-
ing independent evidence that they share a biological
function with MTHFD2, which appears to be distinct
from ATF4-driven induction of MTHFD2.
MTHFD2 is a rapidly regulated protein with a short half-life
Given the above finding that MTHFD2 and the D2PPI
gene set is acutely regulated by pro- and anti-proliferative
stimuli, we examined in more detail the dynamics of
MTHFD2 regulation. Generally, metabolic enzymes are
long-lived proteins, while proteins involved in RNA me-
tabolism, cell cycle, and signaling have shorter half-lives
[22]. In a reanalysis of global protein half-life data [22, 23],
we noted that the half-life of the MTHFD2 protein was
consistently within 17–22 h in HeLa, C2C12, and NIH3T3
cells, which was markedly lower than the other folate
one-carbon enzymes (Fig. 4a) and within the 5–10th per-
centile of all detected enzymes (as defined by Recon2 [24];
596–605 enzymes were detected across three cell lines)
(Fig. 4b). We confirmed this short half-life of MTHFD2 by
treatment with the cyclohexamide inhibitor of protein
synthesis, which resulted in an approximate halving of
protein levels after 24 h (Fig. 4c). Therefore, MTHFD2 is
unusually short-lived for a metabolic enzyme in general,
and one-carbon enzymes in particular.
Considering the short half-life of MTHFD2, we next
examined the regulation of the MTHFD2 protein com-
pared to other enzymes in the mitochondrial folate path-
way. In HCT-116 cells, after 48 h serum starvation,
MTHFD2 and SHMT2 mRNA was significantly de-
creased, while SHMT1, MTHFD1, and MTHFD1L was
unaffected (Fig. 4d). At the protein level, MTHFD2 and
MTHFD1L decreased noticeably at the 24 h time point,
while MTHFD1 did not (Fig. 4e), consistent with the
shorter half-life of MTHFD2. In serum restimulated
HCT-116 cells, MTHFD2 protein was induced within
3 h (Fig. 4f), consistent with our previous report [17].
Moreover, induction of the protein was observed in both
the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments (Fig. 4h),
and also on the mRNA level (Fig. 4g). Our data show
therefore that enzymes of the one-carbon pathway differ
in their response to serum depletion and stimulation,
with MTHFD2 being particularly responsive.
Transcriptional response to MTHFD2 knockdown in
cancer cells
To study the effects of loss of MTHFD2, and how these
relate to its identified interacting proteins, we analyzed
transcriptomics data from MTHFD2 shRNA knockdown
cells generated by the Connectivity Map (CMap) project
[34]. Interestingly, the D2PPI gene set was clearly de-
creased (ES -0.64, p < 10−4) in MTHFD2 knockdown
cells (Fig. 5a) and was among the most negatively
enriched among examined collection of 3581 gene sets
(Fig. 5b). Hence, loss of MTHFD2 affects expression of
the D2PPI genes, consistent with a shared function.
The CMap data also allows assessing functional rela-
tionship between genes by scoring the similarity of tran-
scriptional response of cancer cells to individual gene
knockdown. In this regard, knockdown of MTHFD2 was
highly similar (score > 90/100) to four out of the 14 D2PPI
genes represented in CMap: HSPA8, HSPA9, HSPD1, and
RPS3A.
In
contrast,
with
this
criterion,
other
folate-metabolizing enzymes present in the CMap data set
(MTHFD1, SHMT2, GLDC, AMT, TYMS, MTR, MTRR,
FTCD, and DHFR) were not similar to MTHFD2, with the
exception of MTHFD1 (score = 91.0, rank 414/3798), pos-
sibly reflecting the fact that loss of MTHFD1 also gives se-
vere growth phenotypes [7]. In particular, SHMT2 was
not closely related (score = 18.74 of 100, rank 2790/3798),
consistent with the observations that loss of MTHFD2 is
often detrimental to cells [4], while SHMT2 is not [2], and
suggesting that at least some effects of MTHFD2 suppres-
sion are unrelated to mitochondrial folate metabolism.
Finally, we investigated the sets of genes that in CMap
were highly similar to MTHFD2. We noted that, across all
3798 genes for which shRNA data was available in the
CMap data set, MTHFD2 was highly similar (absolute
score > 90) to 510 genes, compared to only 266 for
SHMT2 and 169 for MTHFD1, indicating that loss
MTHFD2 induces a response that more commonly occurs
with gene knockdown. In addition, the set of 510 genes
similar to MTHFD2 in this respect were clearly different
from those of SHMT2 and MTHFD1 (Fig. 5c), again con-
sistent with MTHFD2 having a distinct function. In par-
ticular, knockdown of MTHFD2, but not SHMT2 or
MTHFD1, was highly similar to knockdown of a group of
ribosomal proteins (Fig. 5d). Therefore, MTHFD2 is
unique in that suppression of this protein causes cellular
transcriptomic responses that are highly similar to those
observed following the targeting of ribosomal proteins.

upstream enzyme SHMT2, seemed counter-intuitive. A
possible explanation is that shRNA knockdown cells still
contain some residual protein, which may be sufficient
to retain activity of a metabolic enzyme, but disrupts a
more sensitive non-metabolic function such as control
of translation. Indeed, there is evidence that a small
amount of residual enzymatic activity can be sufficient
to maintain necessary metabolic output, as seen for ex-
ample with SHMT2 and formylmethionyl-tRNA pools
[35]. To investigate this hypothesis, we compared the ef-
fects of shRNA knockdown to effects of CRISPR knock-
out, using genome-wide shRNA and CRISPR screening
data from the Achilles project, measuring growth pheno-
types across 501 and 341 cell lines, respectively. Here,
genes with shared functions are expected to have similar
dependency profiles across cell lines [30]. Overall, 977
genes were similar to MTHFD2 in the shRNA screening
data, and 161 with CRISPR screening (Pearson’s correl-
ation, Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.05). Interestingly, genes
involved in folate metabolism (SHMT2, GART, GCSH,
FPGS) were similar to MTHFD2 in the CRISPR, but not
in the shRNA screens (Fig. 6a, b, Additional file 7).
Moreover, in a similar analysis of an independent CRISPR
dataset
comprising
14
AML
cell
lines,
SHMT2,
SLC25A32, and MTHFD1L were strongly correlated with
MTHFD2, while cytosolic one-carbon enzymes showed
weak correlations (Fig. 6c). However, in these data sets,
the D2PPI proteins frequently showed strong growth
phenotypes across all cell lines and were not significantly
correlated with MTHFD2 (data not shown). This is con-
sistent with the notion that in CRISPR MTHFD2 knock-
outs, the metabolic disruption dominates the effects on
cell proliferation, while for shRNA knockdown, other
functions of MTHFD2 may play a role.
Discussion
A
common
theme
in
cancer
metabolism
is
that
cancer-associated enzymes of interest as potential thera-
peutic targets [36–38] are frequently found to have
non-metabolic “moonlighting” functions [39, 40]. In this
study, we have demonstrated that MTHFD2 interacts
with ribosomal and RNA processing proteins (Fig. 2,
Table 1), which are also coexpressed with MTHFD2, and
give similar transcriptional phenotypes upon shRNA
knockdown. These distinct methods provide independ-
ent evidence suggesting that MTHFD2 has a previously
unrecognized function in RNA metabolism and/or trans-
lation, although further experiments are required to con-
firm
these
findings,
for
example
using
ribosomal
profiling, in-depth analysis of alternative splicing, and
additional interaction data including reverse Co-IP ex-
periments. The MTHFD2-interacting proteins clearly

consist of previously known complexes of proteins with
related, but also diverse, functions. We found multiple
members
of
the
heterogeneous
ribonuclear
protein
(hnRNP) family of RNA binding proteins, which are of
particular interest for several reasons. hnRNPs are
known to interact with nascent RNA and control their
stability, localization, splicing, and translation, and sev-
eral family members have been implicated in regulation
of cell proliferation and in the endothelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) process [41, 42], which are also af-
fected by RNAi against MTHFD2 [42–44]. While the
consequences of interaction between MTHFD2 and
hnRNPs are not yet clear, one possibility is that this
interaction may allow nuclear MTHFD2 to exert some
control over gene expression; indeed, there are many ex-
amples of hnRNP-interacting proteins influencing gene
regulation via hnRNPs [45–47]. Moreover, hnRNPs may
mediate
signals
on
metabolic
status:
in
particular,
hnRNP-E1 has been reported to regulate gene transcrip-
tion in response to folate starvation [48]. We also ob-
served
interactions
with
components
of
the
small
ribosomal subunit, and with several heat-shock proteins
(HSPs) that assist with the folding and transportation of
target
proteins.
While
HSPs
could
interact
with
MTHFD2 simply to assist its own folding, it is also pos-
sible that MTHFD2 or other components of the ob-
served complexes bind and that regulate the functions of
the HSPs [49]. Interestingly, some of the observed
hnRNPs are involved in heat shock responses as well
[50], hinting at a common role. We also found interac-
tions with proteins involved in DNA repair and replica-
tion (XRCC6 and RPN1), as well as histones (Fig. 2;
Table 1, consistent with observations that the protein
localize to regions of newly formed DNA [17]. Whether
these findings represent more than one distinct function
of the MTHFD2 protein, or rather are multiple aspects
of a single mechanism, is not yet clear.
Although Co-IP coupled with MS is a powerful meth-
odology for the unbiased detection of protein interac-
tions, it is still a technique with false positives (due to
off-target binding of antibodies) and false negatives (due
to failure to capture protein-proteins interactions that
are of transient nature, or due to other technical rea-
sons). To reduce the impact of false positives, we utilized
two antibodies and a CRISPR knockout control. Due to
this stringent approach, it is more probable that we have
missed some real protein interactors rather than identi-
fied false positives. Interestingly, we did not detect inter-
actions
between
MTHFD2
and
other
one-carbon
metabolism enzymes involved in nuclear dTMP synthe-
sis (SHMT1, SHMT2, MTHFD1, TYMS or DHFR) [51],
nor with nuclear lamin to which they are tethered [31].
Such interactions could of course have been missed in
our experiments, since we used quite stringent criteria

to obtain high-quality interactions and did not perform
cross-linking during CoIP. Alternatively, MTHFD2 may
reside in a different compartment. From a biochemical
perspective, nuclear MTHFD2 would not be expected to
contribute to dTMP synthesis, since this process re-
quires CH2-THF which MTHFD2 cannot generate on its
own, as it lacks the formyl-THF synthase domain
present in MTHFD1.
An open question is what drives the recruitment and
association of MTHFD2 with cellular RNA-processing
protein complexes. Because several of the D2PPI pro-
teins are RNA-binding, one possibility is that MTHFD2
itself is an RNA-binding protein and encounters its part-
ners while bound to specific RNAs. Indeed, a recent
large-case study reported that RNA binding proteins
tend to CoIP with a large number of other RNA binding
proteins [52]. Additionally, MTHFD2 contains Rossman
folds, NAD-binding domains that can also bind RNA, as
in the example of GAPDH [53]. A number of enzymes
have been shown to “moonlight” by binding RNA, in-
cluding SHMT2 and MTHFD1 [54], and it has been sug-
gested that this may allow metabolic status to influence
gene regulation [55]. However, it is also possible that
MTHFD2 is not a direct RNA-binding protein, but in-
stead contacts one or more proteins around which the
RNA-binding complex is organized. Further work is re-
quired to demonstrate whether MTHFD2 binds RNA
species directly or indirectly, and understand how the
observed protein-protein interactions are formed and
function. Further experiments will also be important for
validating and extending the findings of this study, such
as Co-IP and transcriptomic studies of enzymatically in-
active MTHFD2 in diverse nutritional and cell condi-
tions. For example it will be of interest to determine
whether the interaction partners of MTHFD2 are modi-
fied in response to availability of one-carbon units,
growth factors or DNA damage.
Conclusions
Our study suggests a role for nuclear MTHFD2 in RNA
metabolism and translation, besides its established func-
tion in mitochondrial folate metabolism. An intriguing
possibility is that the MTHFD2-interacting proteins could
provide a mechanism whereby MTHFD2 can affect gene
expression and cell behaviour, perhaps serving to integrate
information on folate metabolism. While the precise
mechanism remains to be investigated, such a function
would explain the observation that catalytically inactive
MTHFD2 protein is sufficient to promote cell prolifera-
tion [17]. Future investigation of this non-enzymatic func-
tion will be important for pharmaceutically targeting
MTHFD2; for example, inhibitors of MTHFD2 dehydro-
genase activity may not be effective, and instead drugs that
disrupt protein-protein interactions might be required.
