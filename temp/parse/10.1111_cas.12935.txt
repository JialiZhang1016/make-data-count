Cancer cell secretomes are considered a potential source for the discovery of can-
cer markers. In this study, the secretomes of four breast cancer (BC) cell lines
(Hs578T, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and SK-BR-3) were proﬁled with liquid chromatog-
raphy–tandem mass spectrometry analysis. A total of 1410 proteins were identi-
ﬁed with less than 1% false discovery rate, of which approximately 55% (796
proteins) were predicted to be secreted from cells. To ﬁnd BC-speciﬁc proteins
among the secreted proteins, data of immunohistochemical staining compiled in
the Human Protein Atlas were investigated by comparing the data of BC tissues
with those of normal tissues. By applying various criteria, including higher
expression level in BC tissues, higher predicted potential of secretion, and sufﬁ-
cient number of tandem mass spectra, 12 biomarker candidate proteins including
ganglioside GM2 activator (GM2A) were selected for conﬁrmation. Western blot
analysis and ELISA for plasma samples of healthy controls and BC patients
revealed elevation of GM2A in BC patients, especially those who were estrogen
receptor-negative. Additionally, siRNA-mediated knockdown of GM2A in BC cells
decreased migration in vitro, whereas the overexpression of GM2A led to an
increase in cell migration. Although GM2A as a diagnostic and prognostic marker
in BC should be carefully veriﬁed further, this study has established the potential
role of GM2A in BC progression.
B
reast cancer is a major common cancer in women world-
wide. In 2013, approximately 232 340 new cases and
39 620 deaths from BC were estimated in the USA.(1) The
high mortality related to BC is thought to be because of the
advanced stage of disease at presentation. Tumor progression
toward increasing metastatic potential is a complex, multistep
cascade of events that occurs when cancer cells reduce their
adhesion, increase their motility, and therefore develop an abil-
ity to invade local tissues.(2) Therefore, discovery of metasta-
sis-promoting or migration-related proteins for prognosis and
monitoring is beneﬁcial in the ﬁght against BC and enormous
efforts have been made to characterize useful biomarkers for
BC.(3,4)
Recently, the development of proteomic techniques has
led an expansion of the search for new biomarkers.(5) The
most useful biomarkers can be assayed in non-invasively
obtained body ﬂuids such as plasma or serum, and be
linked to BC by a deﬁned mechanism involving cancer
proliferation, migration, and metastasis.(6) However, the dis-
covery of biomarkers using plasma samples is challenging
due to high complexity and wide dynamic range of pro-
teomes. The cancer secretome, which is the whole collec-
tion of proteins released by cancer cells or tissues, has
been proposed as an alternative source of tumor markers.
The rationale supporting this strategy is that secretomes,
being much closer to tumor cells than plasma, may be
enriched with secreted proteins relevant to the disease and
also be more likely to be present in the blood. Therefore,
they may play an important role in many vital biological
and physiological processes related to cancers and become
appropriate targets for non-invasive early diagnosis or mon-
itoring of tumor progression.(7–9)
In this study, secretomes derived from four BC cell lines
were ﬁrst analyzed by LC-MS ⁄MS in order to search for tumor
markers that could also be found in blood plasma. Differen-
tially expressed proteins between normal and cancer breast tis-
sues were then selected by using a public database of
immunohistochemical images. By applying various criteria,
including higher expression level in BC, higher predicted
potential of secretion, and sufﬁcient number of tandem mass
spectra, 12 biomarker candidate proteins, including GM2A,
were selected for conﬁrmation. The expression of these candi-
date proteins were conﬁrmed through Western blot analysis
and ELISA on plasma of healthy control and BC patients. It
was found that GM2A existed at a higher level in BC patient
plasmas. Knockdown of GM2A in BC cells impaired cell

BC progression.
Materials and Methods
Preparation of secretomes and cell lysates. Hs578T, MCF-7,
MDA-MB-231, and SK-BR3 cells were cultured in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin ⁄streptomycin
(Gibco, Rockville, MD, USA) at 37°C with 5% CO2 incubator.
In the case of Hs578T, 0.01 mg⁄mL insulin (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA) was further supplemented. We prepared,
trypsin-digested, and fractionated cell secretomes and lysates
as described in our previous study.(10)
Liquid
chromatography–tandem
mass
spectrometry. Tryptic
digests were separated using a reversed phase Magic C18 col-
umn (75 lm) on an Agilent 1200 HPLC system, (Agilent Tech-
nologies, Santa Clara, CA) with a linear gradient of 10–40% in
acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid for 90 min (400 nL
⁄min). The HPLC system was coupled to an LTQ-XL mass spec-
trometer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, San Jose, CA, USA). The
electrospray ionization source was operated in the positive ion
mode (300–2000 m⁄ z) with spray voltage set at 1.9 kV, capil-
lary voltage at 30 V, and the heated capillary temperature at
250°C. Each scan cycle consisted of one full MS scan in proﬁle
mode followed by six data-dependent MS⁄MS scans with the
following options: isolation width, 1.5 m⁄z; normalized colli-
sion energy, 25%; and dynamic exclusion duration, 180 s.
Analysis of mass spectrometric data. All tandem mass spectral
data were searched by the SEQUEST algorithm (TurboSequest
version 27, revision 12) against the human UniProtKB database
(released in March 2012) supplemented with 199 experimentally
validated FBS contaminant sequences.(11) Two trypsin missed
cleavages, ﬁxed modiﬁcation of carbamidomethylation at cys-
teine (+57.02 Da), and variable modiﬁcation of oxidation at
methionine (+15.99 Da) were allowed. Mass tolerances for MS
⁄MS and MS were set to 0.5 and 2 Da, respectively. Peptide

used
in

tools
(http://
www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/) to predict various secretion path-
ways such as SignalP (version 4.0),(12) SecretomeP (version
2.0),(13) and TMHMM (version 2.0).(14) Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis (http://www.ingenuity.com) was used to determine
the subcellular localization and biological function of proteins.
The HPA version 9.0 (http://www.proteinatlas.org) is a public
database with millions of immunohistochemical images and
was used to compare protein expressions between normal and
BC tissues. All of the secreted proteins were further analyzed
to ascertain whether they had been reported in the PPD (http://
www.plasmaproteomedatabase.org). Oncomine version 4.4.4.4
(https://www.oncomine.org), a cancer microarray database and
Web-based data-mining platform, was used to evaluate gene
expression levels in BC tissues. Microarray data related to BC
were analyzed and integrated through the data-mining plat-
form.(15,16)

siRNA
duplex
and

siRNA as a control (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville,
IA, USA) were transfected to cells using TransIT-TKO trans-
fection reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI, USA). To overexpress
GM2A in cell lines, 4 lg GM2A human cDNA (Origene,
Rockville, MD, USA) and porcine cytomegalovirus as a con-
trol were transfected into the cells using X-tremeGENE HP
DNA transfection reagent (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). After
incubation for 48 h, the expression of GM2A was measured
by quantitative RT-PCR (gene expression, 2DDCT methods)
using
the
StepOnePlus
Real-Time
PCR
system
(Applied
Biosystems, Framingham, MA, USA) and Western blot analy-
sis (protein expression).
Migration assay. Cell migration was analyzed using the Oris
Cell Migration Assay Kit (Platypus Technologies, Madison,
WI, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Brieﬂy,
cells were allowed to migrate for 30 h and were stained with
5 lM calcein AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA). The
ﬂuorescence was then recorded using a ﬂuorescence ﬁlter set
(excitation, 485 nm; emission, 528 nm).
Human plasma. Plasma samples were collected from 104 BC
patients (stage 0, 6 patients; stage I, 24; stage II, 61; stage III,
12; and stage IV, 1) and 40 healthy controls who did not show
any observable diseases at the time of collection. Detailed sam-
ple information is provided in Table S1. The plasma was pre-
pared as suggested by the HUPO Plasma Proteome Project.(17)
Biospecimens for this study were provided by the Asan Medical
Center (Seoul, Korea) and Ajou Human Bio-Resource Bank
(Suwon, Korea), members of the National Biobank of Korea
supported by the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare. All
samples were obtained with informed consent under Institutional
Review Board-approved protocols (IRB No. 2013-0761).
Western blot analysis. After separation by SDS-PAGE, pro-
teins were transferred to PVDF membranes (20 9 15 cm). All
membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in TBS-T buffer
for 1 h at 25°C, and incubated with primary antibodies over-
night at 4°C. Membranes were then incubated with secondary
antibodies for 1 h at 25°C, washed, and visualized with the
ECL primer (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA). The pri-
mary antibodies used in this study were directed against the
following
proteins:
GM2A,
ATP6AP2
(Atlas
Antibodies,
Stockholm, Sweden), FBLN1, and IGFBP5 (Abnova, Taiwan,
China).
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The concentration of
GM2A in human plasma was measured by using commercial-
ized ELISA kits (MyBioSource, San Diego, CA, USA) and
calculated from a six-point standard curve (0–800 ng ⁄mL
GM2A). A quality control sample prepared by plasma samples
pooled from 54 BC patients was included to monitor within-
batch and batch-to-batch variations.
Statistical analysis. Differences between controls and cancer
patients in the plasma levels of GM2A were analyzed using a
non-parametric Mann–Whitney U-test(18) and a receiver–oper-
ating characteristic curve.(19) Statistical analyses were carried
out using MedCalc version 11.5.1.0 (MedCalc Software, Mari-
akerke, Belgium).
Results
Secretomes of four breast cancer cell lines. The overall pro-
cess of searching potential BC markers is shown in Fig-
ure 1(a). From the MS data for secretomes of four BC cell
lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, SK-BR-3, and Hs578T), 936,
603, 585, and 475 human proteins were identiﬁed, respectively
(Fig. 1b, Table S2). To check for contamination by intracellu-
lar proteins, a-tubulin was measured by Western blot to assess
the release of intracellular proteins due to cell death. a-Tubulin
was scarcely detected in the secretomes, but it was clearly
detected in cell lysates (Fig. 1c).
The 1410 non-redundant human proteins were further ana-
lyzed using bioinformatic programs for prediction of protein

these analyses predicted that 55% (796⁄1410) of the identiﬁed
proteins were released into the conditioned media of cultured
cancer cells through various secretory pathways (Table S3). In
addition, 85% (1192 ⁄1410) of the identiﬁed proteins were pre-
viously reported as plasma proteins in PPD. This indicates that
many proteins identiﬁed in the cell secretomes actually get into
blood by various secretion pathways. The major biological
functions of secretomes, as shown in Figure 1(d), were related
to cellular movement (30%), cell death (23%), cellular growth
and proliferation (17%), genetic disorder (14%), cell–cell sig-
naling and interaction (7%), protein synthesis (6%), and gene
expression (3%).
Selection of marker candidates for breast cancer. In the HPA
database, 53 of 1410 proteins were found to be more strongly
stained in BC tissues than in normal tissues. Of these 53 pro-
teins, 38 were predicted to be secreted proteins based on the
above-mentioned in silico programs. We then excluded pro-
teins that had less than four tandem mass spectra for protein
identiﬁcation and that had already been previously reported in
relation to BC. In the ﬁnal outcome (see Fig. 1a for the strat-
egy for selecting candidate proteins), 12 proteins met all the
criteria (listed in Table 1).

12 proteins were ﬁrst pursued using the secretomes and we
were able to ﬁnd that all of the candidate proteins were clearly
present in the conditioned media of BC cell lines (data not
shown). Then we used Western blot analysis in order to exam-
ine whether the 12 proteins could be detected in plasma sam-
ples that were pooled separately from 20 healthy controls and
54 BC patients. Eleven of the 12 candidate proteins were
already reported in PPD, but only four proteins, FBLN1,
ATP6AP2, GM2A, and IGFBP5, were clearly detected in the
plasma (Fig. S1).
mRNA expression of four candidate proteins. The Oncomine
database was used to examine how the mRNA expressions of
four proteins detected in plasma were expressed in various
datasets of BC. The expression levels of three proteins,
GM2A, FBLN1, and IGFBP5, in BC tissues (n = 53) were
higher than those of normal breast tissues (n = 6) (P < 0.001;
Fig. 2a, S2).(20–22) Additionally, GM2A gene expression was
2.42-fold higher in ER-negative BC specimens compared to
ER-positive BC specimens (Fig. 2b). In contrast, ATP6AP2
showed a negative correlation between gene expression and
immunohistochemical data (Fig. S2), and was excluded from
further validation. In a previous study of RAF1 ⁄MAP2K-
transfected MCF-7 BC cell line,(22) GM2A expression was
activated by RAF1 and MAP2K, both known to play a key
role in cell migration, invasion, and metastasis (Fig. 2c). How-
ever, IGFBP5 expression was inhibited by either RAF1 or
MAP2K and no change was reported for FBLN4 under the
same conditions (Fig. S2). Therefore, we selected GM2A as a
BC marker candidate and extracted a list of genes that were
coexpressed with GM2A with a correlation coefﬁcient >0.9.
We subjected the genes to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to
decipher a common role. As seen in Figure 2(d), all of the
genes were relevant to epithelial cancer in their biological
functions. Finally, we attempted to test the role of GM2A in
cell motility.

cer
cells. In
order
to
study
the
role
of
GM2A
in
BC
progression, we controlled GM2A expression levels in the four
BC cell lines and examined its effect on cell migration. The
results applied to GM2A siRNA showed that the expression of
GM2A was signiﬁcantly reduced at both mRNA (Fig. 3a) and
protein levels (Fig. 3b) when compared to the levels in the
control siRNA. As seen in Figure 3(c), GM2A inhibition
decreased the migration of BC cells compared to the control
cells, particularly in MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3 cell lines.
Cell migration assays were also carried out after overexpres-
sion of GM2A. Transfection of the GM2A gene into BC cells
resulted in an increase of GM2 at the protein level (Fig. 3d),
which led to a signiﬁcant increase in the migration rate
(Fig. 3e). Knockdown or overexpression of GM2A showed lit-
tle effect on cell proliferation (Fig. S3). Thus, these ﬁndings
from the cell migration assays indicated that GM2A could play
a role in progression of BC.
Validation of GM2A in BC patients’ plasma samples. To evalu-
ate the diagnostic usefulness as a marker, as an initial test,
Western blot analyses were carried out using the plasma sam-
ples of 54 BC patients and 20 healthy controls. Although the
expression levels of GM2A for all of the BC plasma samples
were not higher than those in healthy control samples, ER-
negative (Fig. 4a, black circles) compared to ER-positive sam-
ples showed a much higher level of GM2A. The levels of the
other three candidate proteins did not change signiﬁcantly in
the plasma of cancer patients (data not shown). We then used
a commercialized ELISA kit to further evaluate GM2A using
samples from 38 healthy controls and 104 BC patients, which
included
the
samples
used
in
Western
blot
analyses
(Table S1). Intra-assay coefﬁcient of variation was less than
10%. Compared to the plasma of healthy controls, the plasma
level of GM2A was 1.25-fold higher in patients with BC (me-
dian values, 5.91 lg⁄mL versus 4.74 lg⁄mL, P = 0.0576;
Fig. 4b). The difference was more signiﬁcant in ER-negative
BCs
(P = 0.0276
for
ER-negative
vs
healthy
control;
P = 0.2277 for ER-positive vs healthy control). The area under

Discussion
As numerous proteins have been found to be differentially
expressed in BC tissues, recently many researchers have made
efforts to discover biomarker candidates, focusing on those
with a higher chance of detection in bodily ﬂuids such as
serum, plasma, milk, and urine.(23–25) Due to the high com-
plexity and dynamic range in serum and plasma proteomes,
proteomic analysis of the secretomes derived from cultured
cancer cells could be an alternative source to ﬁnd serological
markers. In this study, 85% (1192 ⁄1410) of the identiﬁed
proteins from four BC cell lines were reported in PPD. Thus,
proteomic proﬁling of secretomes by shotgun proteomics is an
effective method to further the discovery of serological diag-
nostic markers. Additionally, to increase the identiﬁcation of
true-positive human secreted proteins using LC-MS ⁄MS, tan-
dem mass spectral data were searched against a composite
database that included experimentally validated FBS contami-
nant sequences as well as human sequences.(11)
As shown in Figure 1(a), our own strategy for the selection
of marker candidates was designed. Using this strategy, 1410
human secreted proteins from four BC cell lines were identi-
ﬁed (Fig. 1b), and combined with the quantitative information
of immunohistochemistry images from the HPA public data-
base. We hypothesized that if any protein found in the BC cell

secretomes showed quantitative changes between the normal
and BC tissues, they could stand a better chance of becoming
serological markers. Using the HPA database, we were able to
compare protein expressions between breast tumor and normal
breast tissues without undertaking complex experiments.(26)
Such valuable reference datasets have facilitated the discovery
of markers like GM2A in this study. The analysis of secre-
tomes using in silico programs revealed that approximately
55% of the proteins were predicted as secretory proteins
(Table S3). This is reasonable as most studies on cell secre-
tomes have reported that approximately 45–60% of the identi-
ﬁed proteins were secretory proteins.(27) In our previous
research, the proteins not predicted as secretory proteins by in
silico programs, unlike the ones predicted as such, were not
frequently detected in plasma,(10) therefore, they were not
subjected to further analysis. The public gene expression data-
base Oncomine further provided us with valuable information
regarding cancer speciﬁcity of the target proteins. The gene
expression level of GM2A was much higher in breast tumor
tissues than in normal tissues (Fig. 2a); in particular, the level
was higher in patients with ER-negative disease compared to
those with ER-positive disease (Fig. 2b). The underlying
mechanism of GM2A regulation by ER signaling is not well
known and remains to be established. The protein level of
GM2A was also higher in plasma samples of BC patients,
mostly in ER-negative cases (Fig. 4b). Although protein abun-
dance is not a simple function of DNA copies and mRNA
levels, recently published research has revealed that genes that
are dysregulated at the level of DNA or RNA are also mostly
dysregulated at the level of protein.(28)

Ganglioside GM2 activator encodes a small glycolipid trans-
port protein. This protein binds gangliosides and catalyzes the
degradation of the ganglioside GM2.(29) Gangliosides are
expressed as lipid-bound sialic acids. Gangliosides have been
shown to inhibit cell motility by downregulating epidermal
growth factor receptor activity and the phosphatidylinositol 3-
kinase–protein kinase B signaling pathway.(30) Another study
reported that the GM2⁄GM3 complex strongly inhibited cell
motility through the CD82⁄ cMet-mediated pathway.(31) There-
fore, our results showing higher expression of GM2A, which
activates degradation of ganglioside GM2, in BC also support
those previous ﬁndings and provide a connecting link for
GM2A activity, cell motility, and cancer progression. That is,
overexpression of GM2A increased the motility of BC cells,
while knockdown decreased the cell motility. Although we do
not have conclusive evidence because we tested only four BC
cell lines, such an effect was more prominent in ER-negative
cells from the BC cell migration assay (for example, MDA-
MB-231 vs MCF-7). These results may provide a clue for the
ELISA results in which GM2A was found more frequently in
ER-negative patients than ER-positive patients (Figs. 2b,4).
The ELISA data do not provide strong evidence that GM2A is
useful as a screening marker for BC. However, both speciﬁcity
and sensitivity increased for ER-negative patients. In order to
exploit
GM2A
as
a diagnostic
marker,
further
study is
required. It may include stratiﬁcation of BC patients through
measurement of GM2A in a larger sample set followed by sta-
tistical analysis in relation to various clinical information.
