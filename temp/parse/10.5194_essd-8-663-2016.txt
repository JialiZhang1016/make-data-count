Abstract. The geometries of a catchment constitute the basis for distributed physically based numerical mod-
eling of different geoscientiﬁc disciplines. In this paper results from ground-penetrating radar (GPR) measure-
ments, in terms of a 3-D model of total sediment thickness and active layer thickness in a periglacial catchment
in western Greenland, are presented. Using the topography, the thickness and distribution of sediments are cal-
culated. Vegetation classiﬁcation and GPR measurements are used to scale active layer thickness from local
measurements to catchment-scale models. Annual maximum active layer thickness varies from 0.3 m in wet-
lands to 2.0 m in barren areas and areas of exposed bedrock. Maximum sediment thickness is estimated to be
12.3 m in the major valleys of the catchment. A method to correlate surface vegetation with active layer thick-
ness is also presented. By using relatively simple methods, such as probing and vegetation classiﬁcation, it is
possible to upscale local point measurements to catchment-scale models, in areas where the upper subsurface is
relatively homogeneous. The resulting spatial model of active layer thickness can be used in combination with
the sediment model as a geometrical input to further studies of subsurface mass transport and hydrological ﬂow
paths in the periglacial catchment through numerical modeling. The data set is available for all users via the
PANGAEA database, doi:10.1594/PANGAEA.845258.

Introduction
Recent climate warming, and its effect on near-surface hy-
drothermal regimes, is predicted to have a pronounced effect
in northern latitudes (e.g., Maxwell and Barrie, 1989; Roots,
1989; MacCraken et al., 1990; Burrows et al., 2011; Larsen
et al., 2014). In permafrost regions, where parts of the subsur-
face stay permanently frozen, one noticeable effect of global
warming is a thickening of the active layer (Larsen et al.,
2014). The active layer constitutes an upper sediment and/or
bedrock layer that undergoes annual freezing and thawing.
Thickening of the active layer has biogeochemical, hydro-
logical and geomorphological consequences due to the ex-
change of energy in the form of moisture and gases between
the terrestrial and atmospheric system, which occurs in the
thawed subsurface (Nelson and Anisimov, 1993; Weller et
al., 1995). Additionally, a long-term thawing active layer
may inﬂuence the carbon cycling in the landscape; old car-

J. Petrone et al.: Sediment and active layer thickness in a periglacial lake catchment
bon stored in the permafrost may be released, implying a
positive feedback to climate warming (Walter et al., 2006;
Schuur et al., 2015).
Dramatic changes in the Arctic during the last decades
have, among other things, led to an increase in the length
of the melting season and changes in precipitation patterns
(Macdonald et al., 2005). To understand future local and re-
gional effects of a warming climate in permafrost regions,
it is ﬁrst necessary to understand the present-day conditions
and processes. Modeling the active layer and its variation,
as well as any underlying sediments, is needed to account
for different scenarios in which the active layer will vary in
depth when surface conditions are changing. In addition, in-
formation regarding the properties and spatial distribution of
the sediments and the active layer is valuable when studying
the hydrology and mass transport in permafrost regions.
Conventional methods to identify permafrost features or
bedrock under Quaternary deposits in permafrost regions,
e.g., through boreholes or excavations, can be problematic
and time-consuming due to the frozen conditions. In addi-
tion, such methods provide limited information on the spatial
distribution of such features. Methods for investigating the
spatial variability of the active layer include airborne elec-
tromagnetic measurements (e.g. Pastick et al., 2013), space-
borne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) (e.g.
Liu et al., 2012) and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) (e.g.,
Wu et al., 2009; Stevens et al., 2009). In this study we use
GPR to investigate shallow sub-surface features, such as sed-
iment thickness and the depth of the active layer. GPR sur-
veying has been commonly used since the mid-1990s in geo-
physical studies that require high vertical resolution with lit-
tle or no disturbance in the investigated area (Neal, 2004).
The method is also very ﬂexible, as real-time acquisition
and interpretation of the data immediately give preliminary
results. The suitability of the GPR method to map subsur-
face features in periglacial environments is due to the sig-
niﬁcantly different electrical properties between ice, water,
sediment, bedrock and air. Relative dielectric permittivity is
commonly used to determine the wave velocity of electro-
magnetic waves transmitted and received from the GPR. The
dielectric permittivity is highly inﬂuenced by water content
(Neal, 2004). It is therefore an effective method to map the
permafrost boundary during summer as well as the subsur-
face bedrock (i.e., sediment thickness) when the sediments
are frozen. Many studies using GPR in permafrost environ-
ments have been carried out (e.g., Wu et al., 2009; Stevens
et al., 2009), as have studies using GPR to investigate the
properties of the active layer (e.g., Ermakov and Starovoitov,
2010; Jørgensen and Andreasen, 2007; Doolitle et al., 1990;
Gacitúa et al., 2012). Gacitúa et al. (2012) also showed that
the difference in vegetation cover is closely tied to varying
moisture content of sediments in periglacial environments.
The studies listed above, however, only focus on single
and local proﬁle investigations. The purpose of this study is
to draw conclusions about subsurface conditions over larger
areas, such as individual lake catchments. Here we use GPR
to gather information about the relative dielectric permittivity
(i.e., water content) of the sediments above the permafrost.
The water content of the soil inﬂuences the composition of
vegetation and the thickness of the active layer. A correla-
tion between active layer thickness (ALT) and vegetation can
therefore be expected. This correlation is used to construct a
model of the spatial distribution and variation in the active
layer and upscale results from concentrated measurements to
a catchment-wide model.
In the present study we use GPR during different seasons
to measure the depth to bedrock and ALT within a small lake
catchment, in this paper referred to as Two Boat Lake (TBL),
situated close to the Greenland Ice Sheet (Fig. 1). The sed-
iment thickness within the catchment has been correlated to
topography – i.e., the thickest sediment layers are found in
ﬂat areas of the valley ﬂoors (Petrone, 2013). This estab-
lished relationship, in combination with ﬁeld surveys and
sampling, forms the basis for the construction of a model
of sediment thickness and general stratigraphy. For the ac-
tive layer we analyze the results in combination with probe
measurements to estimate permittivity of the underlying sed-
iments and with remote sensing to classify the vegetation.
The relationship between vegetation and permittivity (Gac-
itúa et al., 2012) is used to calculate active layer depth for all
GPR measurements. The result is a 3-D model of sediment
thicknesses, sediment types and maximum thicknesses of the
active layer, at catchment scale ( ∼1–2 km2). Data on mete-
orological and hydrological conditions and properties of the
TBL catchment were published by Johansson et al. (2015),
and Lindborg et al. (2016) published data on biogeochem-
istry from TBL. These new data on ALT and sediment thick-
ness constitute valuable complementary input data when set-
ting up distributed physically based hydrological and biogeo-
chemical numerical models of the catchment. Since the ac-
tive layer model is superimposed on the sediment model, it is
also possible to study effects of a changing climate by vary-
ing the active layer depth. An increased depth of the active
layer activates new hydrological ﬂow paths above the present
permafrost. The developed 3-D model presented in this study
may constitute a geometrical input to other models studying
the effect of those processes. By correlating different types of
vegetation classes found in periglacial environments to sub-
surface wetness conditions, we construct models extending
outside of the initial point measurements.

Methods
Field investigations were carried out between the years
2010 and 2013. The methodology was conducted stepwise,
and each step is summarized in Fig. 2. The methods can
be divided into two categories/models: one producing a
catchment-wide coverage of the maximum active layer thick-
ness and one focused on the stratigraphy and thickness of

Site description
2.1.1
General site description
The TBL catchment (described in Johansson et al., 2015),
is situated in close proximity to the Greenland Ice Sheet
and approximately 30 km from the settlement of Kangerlus-
suaq, western Greenland (Fig. 1). The Kangerlussuaq region,
reaching from the coast towards the ice sheet, contains an ex-
tensive (> 150 km wide) ice-free area dominated by an undu-
lating periglacial tundra environment with numerous lakes.
The annual corrected precipitation (P) recorded by the local
automatic weather station in the TBL catchment, installed in
April 2011, was 365 mm in 2012 and 269 mm in 2013 (Jo-
hansson et al., 2015). This is approximately twice as much
as the precipitation measured in Kangerlussuaq for the cor-
responding periods (Cappelen, 2014). The mean annual air
temperature (MAAT) at TBL is −4.3 ◦C for the same period
(Johansson et al., 2015) and −4.8 ◦C in Kangerlussuaq (Cap-
pelen, 2014).
The cold climate has resulted in a region of continu-
ous permafrost. The permafrost is, in turn, interrupted by

through taliks, i.e., local areas with no permafrost, often sit-
uated below larger lakes (Christiansen and Humlum, 2000).
A bedrock borehole below TBL and the results from the in-
vestigations made in the instrumented drill hole have shown
that the lake is underlain by a through-talik and that the per-
mafrost in surrounding land areas reaches a depth of around
300 to 400 m (Harper et al., 2011). The active layer freezes
and thaws in cycles directly related to the seasonal variations
in air temperature, with a maximum thawed depth at the end
of summer.
The area of TBL is 0.37 km2 and its catchment covers an
area of 1.56 km2 (Johansson et al., 2015). There is a height
difference of around 200 m from the deepest part of the lake
(∼30 m water depth) to the highest point in the southwestern
part of the catchment (Fig. 3).
Most of the catchment has sparse but continuous vege-
tation cover, with some exceptions of areas with exposed
bedrock or till. Vegetation is in general dominated by dwarf-
shrub heath. There are no trees, and the shrubs rarely exceed
0.5 m in height. There is a fairly limited number of vascular
plant species, but the spatial distribution and density of in-
dividual species are highly variable in different parts of the
catchment. The vegetation has been classiﬁed into several
categories (Fig. 3a), based on ﬁeld surveys and classiﬁcation
in aerial photographs (Clarhäll, 2011). Heath covers a large
portion of the catchment; major plants in this class are Be-
tula nana, Salix glauca and Vaccinium uliginosum. The veg-
etation is classiﬁed as either Betula or Salix if any one plant
dominates the coverage. In general, the class heath consists
of a mixture of plant species where dwarf shrubs are a signif-
icant constituent. Barren surfaces (Fig. 3a), completely lack-
ing vegetation, are present in exposed areas where wind has
eroded the silt layer and exposed underlying till or bedrock.
Grasslands on ridges and exposed dry areas (Fig. 3a) are also
scattered around the catchment. The catchment in general
constitutes a very dry environment, but a few topographically
low areas can be saturated with water during and after events
of high precipitation, as well as when the snowpack melts
during springtime. Areas with relatively high soil water con-
tent have thus developed and are here termed wetlands.
2.1.2
Quaternary geology of the study area
The geographical distribution of sediment types was deter-
mined during ﬁeld surveys in the summers of 2010 and 2011.
Sediment samples were taken from seven locations (Fig. 3b)
and analyzed for grain-size distribution. Results from the
ﬁeld observations were used to construct a conceptual model
illustrating the stratigraphical distribution of the most com-
monly occurring sediment types. The results are partly re-
ported by Clarhäll (2011).
The Quaternary geology within the catchment was ﬁrst
described by Clarhäll (2011). An updated sediment map,
based on new results from later excavations and ﬁeld ob-
servations, is presented in the present paper (Fig. 3b). The
uppermost sediments are dominated by eolian silt, under-
lain by till, which is also representative of the regional area
(Clarhäll, 2011). Deposition of the eolian silt has occurred
since at least ca. 4750 years BP (Willemse et al., 2003), when
the ice margin was situated further inland (van Tatenhove et
al., 1996). Surﬁcial glacial till and bedrock outcrops can be
found in places where erosion has removed the eolian silt.
The boundary is often sharp with a scarred surface reveal-
ing the underlying till. The till is loosely compacted and is
dominated by sand and gravel with a low content of silt and
clay, which indicates a marginal deposition in front of the ice
sheet (Clarhäll, 2011). Glacioﬂuvial deposits are also found
in several areas, mainly in the northern regions of the catch-
ment. Stratigraphical studies have shown that the till contains
layers of water laid deposits and the hydrological properties
of the till and the glacioﬂuvial deposits can therefore be re-
garded as comparable. In the central and low-lying parts of
the major valleys, silt deposition and accumulation of organic
material have resulted in areas of peaty silt. The ﬂoor of the
lake is covered to a large extent by currently accumulating
silt. Permafrost-related processes have also led to the devel-
opment of ice-wedge polygons in local areas where the sedi-
ments are characterized by a relatively high water content.
2.2
Digital elevation model
A ﬁrst digital elevation model (DEM) for TBL and its catch-
ment was constructed in 2011 (Clarhäll, 2011). In 2012, a
lidar survey and a bathymetric survey of the TBL catchment
area were carried out. A new improved DEM, with the same
extent as the previous one, was constructed within the present
study from the newly acquired data.

The lidar data were collected for a large part of the TBL
catchment using a Riegl Z-450 (2000 m range) laser scan-
ner. Survey stations and ground control points were surveyed
and georeferenced to geodetic control quality (∼centimeter
precision) using a Leica 1200 GPS receiver processed by Le-
ica Geo Ofﬁce and corrected to a local GNSS (global navi-
gation satellite system) base station located with a baseline
distance of less than 5 km. The lidar data were projected to
UTM 22N, adjusted to a local GR96 (Greenland Reference
System 1996) datum point in Kangerlussuaq and converted

from WGS84 ellipsoid heights to the local elevation datum.
The vertical offset between the ellipsoid height and the local
datum is −31.1 m.
Approximately 21 million elevation values were collected
during the lidar data measurement. These values were recal-
culated to mean values within 1 m cells. In the terrestrial ar-
eas not covered by lidar data, elevation data from the previ-
ous DEM (Clarhäll, 2011) were used. Lidar data within 2 m
from the lake shoreline were removed to obtain a smoother
transition between the lake and the terrestrial area in the
DEM.
The bathymetric survey of TBL was made with a com-
bined echo sounder and GPS (Humminbird 798ci HD SI) at-
tached to a boat. Positions, water depth and bottom hardness
were stored every second during the measurements. Incor-
rect measurements were subsequently removed and in some
areas depth data were thinned out to obtain a similar data
density over the surveyed area. After these corrections, ap-
proximately 18 500 measurements remained. Monitoring of
lake level variations was initiated in September 2010 (Jo-
hansson et al., 2015). All water depth values from TBL were
adjusted to the lake level at the beginning of the monitoring
and were converted to the coordinate system used for the li-
dar data. Points were added along the lake shoreline every
5 m using the extension of the lake shown in Clarhäll (2011).
The lake shoreline was adjusted to the lidar data and a lake
level of 336.4 m a.s.l. was determined. The depth data from
TBL were recalculated from the lake level, i.e., from depth
in meters below 336.4 m a.s.l.
Finally, terrestrial data and depth values were merged
to a data set of approximately 1.3 million points. From
this data set, a 5 m by 5 m resolution DEM was con-
structed. The interpolation of point values was done us-
ing the Geostatistical Analysis extension in ArcGIS 10.1.
Ordinary Kriging was chosen as the interpolation method
(Davis, 1986; Isaaks and Srivastava, 1989). The different
data sources and their estimated accuracy are shown in Ap-
pendix A. The resulting DEM is available at PANGAEA
(doi:10.1594/PANGAEA.845258).
2.3
Thickness surveys of sediments and active layer
The total sediment thickness in the catchment was investi-
gated by GPR in April 2011 (Petrone, 2013). A MALÅ X3M
shielded antenna GPR system, with a central frequency of
250 MHz, was used. A Trimble R7 GPS was connected to
the GPR to log the position of each measurement. Each pro-
ﬁle was measured by dragging the GPR equipment at con-
stant walking speed. The measurements were carried out in
straight proﬁles perpendicular to each other to analyze the
spatial variation in sediment thickness. The methodology is
thoroughly described in Petrone (2013).
To establish absolute sediment depth values, the start
and end points of each transect were situated at or nearby
bedrock outcrops. This allowed the bedrock reﬂector to be
easily identiﬁed and continuously traced along the transects.
The relationship between sediment thickness and topogra-
phy (DEM) constitute the basis for the sediment model. The
updated DEM, described in Sect. 2.3, was used to extract
the steepness of the topography. The surface sediment map
(Fig. 3b) was also used as input to provide the spatial distri-
bution of sediment types.
The thickness of the active layer was investigated by prob-
ing in 83 points in several transects in August 2011 us-
ing a steel rod (Fig. 3b). All points were located in tran-
sects at semi-regular intervals covering different soil types,
vegetation and topographic properties (such as elevation,
slope and aspect). The relevant transects are marked with
“1” and “2” in Fig. 3b. An additional GPR survey was car-
ried out simultaneously to the probe measurements, using
GPR equipment identical to that used during the earlier mea-
surements. This survey was concentrated to three sub-areas
(Fig. 3a). All GPR proﬁles related to the active layer sur-
veys were processed and analyzed in the same way as in
Petrone (2013). Low- and high-frequency noise was reduced
by applying dewow and bandpass ﬁlters and each proﬁle was
geo-referenced. A clear reﬂector, identiﬁed as the reﬂection
of the boundary between thawed and frozen sediments, can
be identiﬁed in most proﬁles. In proﬁles with a less clear
and/or discontinuous reﬂector, or in cases of extremely noisy
radargrams, the data were discarded. All remaining selected
points, representing the interpreted travel time from the sur-
face to the permafrost boundary and back, are seen in Fig. 3a.
2.4
Modeling of active layer depth and sediment
thickness
2.4.1
Vegetation class and radar wave velocity
correlation
As previously mentioned, recent studies involving GPR and
the active layer have shown that there is a strong inﬂuence
on water content, and thus electromagnetic wave velocity,
from different vegetation types (Gacitúa et al., 2012). A sim-
ilar approach is used in the present study. In order to cal-
culate the depth of the active layer it is necessary to know
the wave velocity in the medium. Eolian silt covers a ma-
jor part of the catchment, and it is considered homogeneous
down to the underlying till. Thus, mainly water content and
organic matter varies in the sediment layer, hosting the ac-
tive layer. The variation in vegetation within the study area
can therefore be correlated to soil water content (and hence
wave velocity in the eolian silt). Probe transect 1, marked in
Fig. 3b, is situated in the northern valley of the catchment.
The results and interpretation from the transect are shown
in Fig. 4a–c and the proﬁle is presented in E–W direction.
Processed GPR data are displayed in Fig. 4a, showing travel
time and reﬂectors. The identiﬁed permafrost table reﬂector
and active layer depths from probing are presented in Fig. 4b.
Electromagnetic wave velocity was calculated for the probed

class variation is shown in Fig. 4c, along with any permafrost
features. For clarity, the vegetation classes along the transect
shown in Fig. 4c are also included in panel b. Mean values
of radar wave velocity were assigned to corresponding vege-
tation classes (heath: 0.059 m ns−1; wetland: 0.045 m ns−1;
Betula: 0.058 m ns−1). Grassland, absent along transect 1,
was assigned a velocity value based on heath and Betula
(0.0585 m ns−1), assumed to be similar in soil water content.
The wave velocity near the shore line (water class) was as-
signed a velocity of 0.05 m ns−1 based on saturated silt (Neal,
2004). Assigned velocities and the source for the estimation
are presented in Table 2.
2.4.2
Upscaling of active layer depth to catchment scale
based on vegetation classes
The vegetation map presented in Clarhäll (2011), shown in
Fig. 3a, was based on areal photographs of the catchment.
However, the classiﬁcation was not of satisfactory detail for
the analysis in the present study since it had to better match
the high resolution of the GPR measurements. In order to in-

etation maps. The resulting maps provided high-resolution
information on vegetation cover over the areas investigated
by the GPR and probe measurements.
All reﬂectors (Fig. 3a), i.e., points within the area with
a known travel time for the electromagnetic wave to the
permafrost table, were assigned a wave velocity based on
Table 2 and the vegetation in that point. The velocity es-
timations for each vegetation group, presented in Table 2,
were controlled by applying the velocities for each vege-
tation group to another transect, transect 2 in Fig. 3b. The
processed GPR data, plotted topography and vegetation, as
well as the permafrost boundary and probe measurements of
transect 2, are shown in Fig. 4d–f. The comparison between
measured and modeled values of the active layer thickness
(Fig. 4e) shows good accuracy (R2 = 0.84) when using the
estimated velocities in Table 2. In summary, Fig. 4b presents
active layer depths along transect 1 based on probe measure-
ments, whereas Fig. 4e presents active layer depths along
transect 2 based on calculated velocities for each vegetation
group along this transect.
To calculate the active layer thickness for all reﬂector
points in Fig. 3, the re-classiﬁed vegetation maps described
above were used. Each GPR measurement was assigned the
estimated velocity from Table 2, corresponding to the veg-
etation class. The results are summarized in Table 3, listing
the different vegetation classes and the calculated active layer
depths. The mean active layer thickness for each vegetation
class was used to construct the catchment model of the active
layer. Since no measurements of active layer thickness were
made over bedrock, the value of 2.0 m for the depth corre-
sponding to the barren class has been taken from Harper et
al. (2011), which is based on bedrock borehole temperatures
in the area. The mean active layer thickness values of each
vegetation class were fed into the lower-resolution map of the
vegetation coverage, resulting in the catchment-wide model
of the variation in active layer thickness. Sharp boundaries
between vegetation classes (and thus active layer depth) were
smoothed using a mean ﬁlter.
Data from a soil temperature station (Fig. 3b), continu-
ously monitoring temperatures every 3 h in the sediments at
0.25, 0.5, 0.75. 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 m depth below surface, were
used as an additional source of information regarding the ac-
tive layer depth (Johansson et al., 2015). The station is lo-
cated in heath vegetation along transect 2 (Fig. 3b). The data
have been used partly to verify the result of the active layer
model, as supportive information regarding the seasonal evo-
lution of the active layer within the catchment, and to analyze
annual differences in the thaw depth of the layer.

Results
3.1
Sediment thickness
The ﬁnal result is a 3-D model illustrating the thickness of the
most commonly occurring sediment types. Based on hydro-
logical properties, the sediments have been divided into three
major classes: glacial deposits, eolian silt and lacustrine silt.
The classes are further described below.
Glacial deposits. This class includes both till and
glacioﬂuvial deposits, since these deposits have similar hy-
drological properties (see above). The GPR measurements
show that the thickness of the glacial deposits ranges from
0 m where bedrock is exposed to 10 m in the central and low-
lying parts of the valleys and the lake ﬂoor (Petrone, 2013).
The slope of the ground surface has been assumed to mainly
dictate the thickness of this layer. Based on results from the
GPR measurements (Petrone, 2013) and the sediment map,
larger ﬂat zones (slope < 5◦) has been assigned a thickness
of 10 m, while steeper (slope > 60◦) sections lack any glacial
deposits. A linear interpolation was used to assign the thick-
ness value between the minimum and maximum values. In
addition, the modeled sediment thickness was manually in-
creased where the glacial deposits comprise positive morpho-
logical landforms, such as along ridges.
Eolian silt. This sediment class covers a major part of the
catchment and is superimposed on the glacial deposits. In
steep topography, no silt has accumulated or has been eroded
and re-deposited elsewhere. In several ﬂat and exposed ar-
eas, wind has eroded and removed any vegetation and silt,
revealing the surrounding silt and underlying till. The thick-
ness of the silt in these regions is approximately 0.2 m. The
maximum depth of the silt is found in the central and low-
lying parts of the valleys, reaching a thickness of 1 m. Thus,
the thickness of the eolian silt is also largely dependent on
the topography, as well as the distance from any eroded sec-
tions. From the ﬁeld observations and coverage maps, eolian
silt has been assigned a thickness of 0.2 m in proximity to
eroded sections and steeper parts (slope > 50◦) to 1.0 m in
the ﬂat (slope < 5◦) and low-lying sections of the catchment
(Clarhäll, 2011).
Lacustrine silt. These sediments are superimposed on the
glacial deposits at the lake ﬂoor. Due to wave action, no de-
posits of lacustrine silt are found in the shallow (< 2 m) parts
of the lake. In the deeper parts, the deposits have a thickness
of around 1.5 m (Petrone, 2013). The thickness of the lacus-
trine silt deposit between the shallow and the deeper part is
based on linear interpolation.

Figure 5 shows the ﬁnal model of the thickness of each
sediment layer. Glacial deposits (Fig. 5a), mainly till, have
been deposited on top of the bedrock during periods with
a more extensive Greenland Ice Sheet. At higher elevations,
and where the slope is steep, no glacial deposits are generated
in the model. Thinner layers of sediment are found in close
proximity to exposed bedrock. In ﬂatter terrain and in central
parts of valleys, the sediment thickness increases to around
10 m. A thin layer of eolian silt covers much of the glacial
deposits (Fig. 5b). These eolian deposits have a maximum
depth of 1 m in ﬂat terrain and generally decrease where the
topography steepens. Figure 5b also shows the lacustrine silt
at the lake ﬂoor. Lake deposits are only found at depths below
2 m in the model, and they gradually increase with depth,
reaching a maximum of 1.5 m at the deepest part of the lake.
The results have been used to construct a schematic sedi-
ment distribution model within the catchment (Fig. 6). Till
makes up the majority of the volume of sediment and is
present in all areas of the catchment. At the valley ﬂoors,
the eolian silt is partly rich in organic material due to higher
soil water content and is denoted peaty silt. The maximum
thickness of the sediments can be found where the glacial de-
posits constitute positive landforms, such as along glacioﬂu-
vial ridges.
3.2
Active layer
Based on the methodology described in Sect. 3.2 and 3.3,
a catchment-wide model of the active layer was produced
(Fig. 7a). The shallowest active layer is found within the val-
ley wetlands, often in close proximity to the lake and has an
average maximum thickness of 0.48 m. Areas dominated by
heath, Betula and grassland, generally constituting drier ar-
eas, have a thicker maximum active layer (between 0.68 and
0.80 m). The thickest active layer is, however, found in the
barren areas with exposed bedrock (2.0 m), where the pre-
deﬁned value of 2.0 m is used (see above). The active layer
depth gradually increases along the shore, where it evolves
into the talik feature. The schematic ﬁgure represents a gen-
eral valley area of the catchment, ranging from the catchment
boundary towards the lake. There are four main valleys in the
catchment area, which are marked with black dashed lines in

mately 0.3 m) and have thus been included in the schematic
model (Fig. 7b).
Based on the soil temperatures, monitored in the vegeta-
tion class heath, the development of the thaw depth in the
active layer can be visualized in a contour plot which cov-
ers the entire period of September 2010 to December 2015
(Fig. 8). The maximum observed thaw depth in 2011 (Fig. 8),
when the GPR measurements were carried out, is 0.75 m,
which is within the range of the active layer depth for the
vegetation class heat calculated to 0.68 ± 0.09 m (Table 3).
When looking at the maximum thaw depth each year, 2011
stands out as a colder period. In subsequent years the thaw
depth reaches 0.8 m or more. A consistent thaw depth, deeper
than 25 cm, is reached in June in all years. The plot does not
show shallow (< 25 cm) temperature ﬂuctuations but tem-
peratures in the uppermost sediments rise above 0 ◦C in late
April to early May (Johansson et al., 2015). In June, the air
temperature is always above freezing and the thawed depth
gradually migrates downward in the soil. Maximum temper-
atures in the upper part of the soil occur in early August,
whereas the thawed layer continues to increase in thickness
until early September, although the rate slows down during
August. The upper part of the active layer freezes once air
temperatures drop below 0 ◦C for longer periods. Large ﬂuc-
tuations in temperatures during the October months led to
periods with freezing and thawing of the upper part of the
active layer at the same time as the lower boundary of the
active layer migrates upwards. Data from the soil tempera-
ture station show that parts of the sediments stay thawed un-
til mid-October, and in warmer years, such as 2012, as far
as into early November. In this way, different surface condi-
tions leads to variation in not only the length of the active
period, i.e., the time period when a thawed active layer ex-
ists, but also the active layer thickness. The general pattern of
the evolution of the active layer is similar each year: a rapid
thaw in early June which stagnates in late August followed
by a more complex refreeze in late September to October.

Discussion
GPR is a powerful tool that can be used to investigate sev-
eral properties of the subsurface. During frozen ground con-
ditions it can be used to determine the depth to the bedrock
and any intermediate stratigraphical horizons. In areas with
relatively homogeneous sediments and a known Quaternary
history, such as the present study area, the measurements can
be combined with a digital elevation model and ﬁeld obser-
vations to construct a model of the different sediments types
and their spatial variation in thickness. In this study we rely
on radar proﬁles which transect bedrock outcrops and make
it possible to trace the bedrock and thus sediment thickness.
Since we use the pronounced topography in the catchment
to such a large extent when modeling the sediment thick-
ness, it might not be feasible to use the same methods in
areas with less pronounced topography. GPR is also a suit-
able method to investigate the permafrost table in periglacial
environments, due to the large difference in electrical proper-
ties between thawed and frozen sediments. Since soil water
content inﬂuences the permittivity of the medium to a large
degree, one must ﬁrst estimate the permittivity of the mate-
rial. Here we used aerial photographs to tie vegetation classes
to a speciﬁc soil water content (and hence its dielectric prop-
erties), using probe measurements to determine the absolute
depth to the permafrost table. This allowed us to process the
GPR measurements and resulted in over a thousand points for
the active layer thickness over several vegetation classes. As
can be seen in Fig. 4b and Table 3, the active layer thickness
can vary signiﬁcantly within small areas and within vegeta-
tion classes. It would be very time-consuming to perform the
probe measurements with a resolution as high as that which

was used with the GPR, especially when working in a large
area such as the studied catchment. However, radar measure-
ments can continuously map variations in active layer thick-
ness in a relatively short amount of time. The result from
the GPR showed distinct variations in thickness of the ac-
tive layer between vegetation classes. The variation between
classes was used to upscale the results to a catchment-wide
model. An uncertain factor is the active layer thickness in

J. Petrone et al.: Sediment and active layer thickness in a periglacial lake catchment
barren areas, often with little to no soil water content. Here
we used temperature measurements from a nearby borehole,
which showed the active layer extending down to 2.0 m in
the bedrock (Harper et al., 2011). The signiﬁcant increase
in active layer thickness in the bedrock compared to sedi-
ments can be explained by the difference in thermal proper-
ties, namely thermal diffusivity. Bedrock has a higher diffu-
sivity compared to the sediments and transfer heat at a higher
rate (Janza, 1975), affecting the energy transfer from the sur-
face and leading to deeper penetration of energy (heat) in a
given active period. The same argument can be applied to
the difference in the active layer thickness between differ-
ent vegetation classes. Since the surface vegetation is directly
connected to soil moisture content, differences in water con-
tent of the sediments will affect the diffusivity of the mate-
rial. The diffusivity of water (1.5 × 10−3 cm2 s−1) compared
to that of soil (3–5 × 10−3 cm2 s−1) will lead to a quicker
thickening of the active layer and hence deeper permafrost
table during the active period. The energy from the surface
has several sources, including air temperature, precipitation
and solar radiation, that will also inﬂuence the active layer
thickness. This relationship has not been investigated in the
present study and variations in these parameters within the
catchment are not accounted for in detail. However, inves-
tigations of the active layer depth have been carried out in
different areas within the catchment, and local variations are
therefore assumed to be included in the ﬁnal model results.
In this study we focus on the spatial and temporal variation in
the active layer within the catchment. The permafrost bound-
ary is at, or very near, its deepest point in August. However, it
should be noted that the GPR measurements were carried out
in 2011. This year is shown to have the shallowest observed
thaw depth at the soil temperature station in the end of the
active period. During the period of soil temperature measure-
ments (Fig. 8), the temperature sensor at 1 m depth never ex-
perienced temperatures below 0 ◦C. The average thaw depth
in the active layer for the period 2011–2015 is 0.9 m. The
measurements and active layer model produced here reﬂect
the year of 2011 and should therefore perhaps be seen as a
low value for the thickness of the active layer.
Long-term variations in the thawing depth or in the du-
ration of the active period may affect the local hydrology
and transport of matter in the catchment. An increased thaw
depth of the active layer might open up new pathways for wa-
ter to ﬂow, drastically altering the subsurface hydrology of
the catchment. Additionally, it is unclear whether increased
thawing of the active layer will lead to drier or wetter condi-
tions in Arctic landscapes, which affects the cycling of car-
bon. The presented models of ALT and sediment thickness
can be used as input in hydrological models aiming at inves-
tigating the storage and partitioning of water in Arctic land-
scapes under increased thawing conditions.

Data availability
All data needed to construct the soil and active layer mod-
els, as well as the models themselves, are freely available
from PANGAEA: doi:10.1594/PANGAEA.845258. The spa-
tial information on sediment distribution with depth is valu-
able when assigning hydraulic properties to conceptual and
numerical hydrological models of the catchment, which in
turn may be used to model biogeochemical transport and pro-
cesses in both the limnic and terrestrial system.

Conclusion
We have used a combination of remote sensing, ground-
penetrating radar, ﬁeld surveys, digital elevation model anal-
ysis and probe measurements to construct two models over
the catchment: one of the sediment thickness and another
of the maximum active layer thickness. The sediment thick-
ness ranges from 0 m in bedrock outcrops areas to more than
12 m in the central valleys. The active layer is mostly con-
ﬁned within the upper 0.7 m of the sediment (excluding the
bedrock), which mostly consists of eolian silt. The active
layer thickness varies from 0.3 m in the wetland areas to 2 m
in areas with bedrock outcrops.
We show that, by using relatively simple methods, it is
possible to upscale local point measurements to catchment-
scale models in areas where the upper subsurface is relatively
homogeneous. By identifying generalized active layer thick-
ness values for different vegetation classes, we were able to
construct a 3-D model of the active layer thickness at catch-
ment scale based on vegetation coverage.

Appendix A: Data sources to the digital elevation
model (DEM)
The digital elevation model was developed using data from
three data sources:
i. an aerial photo from the company providing aerial pho-
tos, Scancort;
ii. combined GPS and echo-sounding measurements in the
lake to create the bathymetry;
iii. lidar data from measurements presented in the present
paper.
The coverage for each data source is presented in Fig. A1.
Details about the data processing based on information
from Scancort are presented in Clarhäll (2011). Two mea-
surement campaigns with the combined GPS–echo-sounding
technique were performed: one campaign in 2010 and one
in 2011. Details about the measurements performed in 2010
are presented in Clarhäll (2011), and the measurements per-
formed in 2011 are described in the present paper. The GPS
acquisition for the bathymetry was done without real-time
kinematic correction, as there is no such option for this
particular GPS receiver. The combined GPS–echo-sounding
equipment (Humminbird 798ci HD SI) has estimated accu-
racy in the range of ±1 m in the horizontal plane and ±0.1 m
in depth.
