Abstract
Background: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a highly aggressive neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin caused by
either the integration of Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) and expression of viral T antigens or by ultraviolet-
induced damage to the tumor genome from excessive sunlight exposure. An increasing number of deep
sequencing studies of MCC have identified significant differences between the number and types of point
mutations, copy number alterations, and structural variants between virus-positive and virus-negative tumors.
However, it has been challenging to reliably distinguish between virus positive and UV damaged MCC.
Methods: In this study, we assembled a cohort of 71 MCC patients and performed deep sequencing with OncoPanel,
a clinically implemented, next-generation sequencing assay targeting over 400 cancer-associated genes. To improve
the accuracy and sensitivity for virus detection compared to traditional PCR and IHC methods, we developed a hybrid
capture baitset against the entire MCPyV genome and software to detect integration sites and structure.
Results: Sequencing from this approach revealed distinct integration junctions in the tumor genome and generated
assemblies that strongly support a model of microhomology-initiated hybrid, virus-host, circular DNA intermediate that
promotes focal amplification of host and viral DNA. Using the clear delineation between virus-positive and virus-
negative tumors from this method, we identified recurrent somatic alterations common across MCC and alterations
specific to each class of tumor, associated with differences in overall survival. Finally, comparing the molecular and
clinical data from these patients revealed a surprising association of immunosuppression with virus-negative MCC and
significantly shortened overall survival.
Conclusions: These results demonstrate the value of high-confidence virus detection for identifying molecular
mechanisms of UV and viral oncogenesis in MCC. Furthermore, integrating these data with clinical data revealed
features that could impact patient outcome and improve our understanding of MCC risk factors.

Background
Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a highly aggressive neu-
roendocrine carcinoma of the skin. Risk factors for devel-
oping MCC include advanced age, light skin color with
excessive sunlight exposure, and a variety of immunocom-
promised conditions [1]. In 2008, Merkel cell polyomavi-
rus (MCPyV) was first detected by Southern blot in some
but not all MCC tumors with integration of viral DNA oc-
curring at several different chromosomal sites. Import-
antly, an identical clonal integration pattern was detected
in one primary tumor and corresponding metastatic
lymph node [2]. This important insight implied that inte-
gration of the viral DNA was an early if not initiating
event in virus-positive MCC oncogenesis. MCPyV infects
most people, typically at an early age, and results in an
asymptomatic and lifelong infection indicated by the per-
sistent presence of antibodies to the viral coat protein VP1
[3, 4]. Although MCPyV DNA can be readily detected on
the skin, the cell types where the virus replicates in vivo
have not been determined [5].
Since the original discovery of MCPyV, it has become in-
creasingly clear that virus-positive MCC has a different eti-
ology than virus-negative, UV-associated, MCC [1]. Virus-
positive MCC expresses the viral oncogenes large T anti-
gen (LT) and small T antigen (ST) and the tumor genome
usually contains very few mutations in cellular oncogenes
and tumor suppressor genes. In contrast, studies using
whole exome or targeted hybrid capture sequencing have
revealed that virus-negative MCC has an exceptionally high
somatic mutation load predominated by UV-mediated mu-
tations with frequent mutations in RB1, TP53, NOTCH1,
and FAT1 [6, 7]. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of
MCC confirmed virus-positive MCC exhibits a globally
lower, non-UV-mediated, mutation burden as well as few
somatic copy number amplifications, deletions, and rear-
rangements compared to virus-negative MCC, while pro-
viding new insights into the structure and mechanism of
virus integration [8].
Accurate detection of the presence of MCPyV and dis-
tinguishing between virus-positive and virus-negative
MCC is important for insight into the oncogenesis, cell-
of-origin, and therapeutic options. Currently, there is no
routine clinical effort to distinguish between virus-
positive MCC and virus-negative MCC. Several recent
studies have suggested differences between virus-positive
MCC and virus-negative MCC in presentation, age, and
response to immunotherapy [9–15]. However, current
techniques for determining viral status have yielded ei-
ther inaccurate or ambiguous results. Although WGS
provides much more genetic information on the tumor
and viral genome compared to targeted approaches, it
remains impractical for clinical evaluation of MCC.
The most common methods for detection of MCPyV
in MCC include PCR amplification of MCPyV DNA
from DNA isolated from MCC tumors or immunohisto-
chemistry (IHC) staining for MCPyV LT using monoclo-
nal antibodies CM2B4 and Ab3 [16, 17]. However, both
PCR and IHC have been shown to be unreliable in dis-
tinguishing between virus-positive from virus-negative
MCC. For example, a recent study of 282 cases of MCC
evaluated virus positivity by IHC with monoclonal anti-
bodies CM2B4 and Ab3 or by PCR with a previously val-
idated primer set [18]. Notably, there was concordance
for all three assays in only 167 of 282 (59.2%) cases with
an additional 62 cases positive for two of the three tests.
The remaining 53 (18.8%) were positive for one test or
none. This study assigned the MCC to be virus-positive
if two or three tests were positive, implying that detec-
tion of viral DNA by PCR alone was not sufficient for a
tumor to be called virus-positive MCC. Furthermore, be-
cause of the sensitivity of PCR in detecting DNA, a
lower limit of 0.01 copy of MCPyV DNA per tumor cell
was called virus-positive MCC. Tumors containing <
0.01 viral copies/cell were called virus-negative. A differ-
ent study using RNA-ISH to detect mRNA specific for
MCPyV LT and ST found this method to be as sensitive
as qPCR when using two primer sets and the viral copy
number was set to > 0.004/cell [19]. The AMERCK test
detects circulating antibodies against the MCPyV ST
[20]. The sensitivity of this test is low for detection of
virus-positive MCC but, when positive, can be used as a
biomarker for disease status [20].
The high somatic mutation burden in virus-negative
MCC is predicted to yield more tumor neoantigens than
melanomas or non-small cell lung cancers (median of 173,
65, and 111 neoantigens/sample, respectively) [21] [22].
As observed for other tumor types, the high neoantigen
burden in virus-negative MCC corresponds to a higher
degree of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in some tumors,
but these tumors also express PD-L1 rendering these lym-
phocytes ineffective [7]. Despite the numerous observed
differences in mutation rate and number of predicted
neoantigens, both virus-positive MCC and virus-negative
MCC tumors have shown high response rates to PD-L1
and PD1 checkpoint blockade therapy [14, 15].
For further advancements to be made in understanding
MCC, especially for patients not responsive to current
therapies, clear and accurate determination of the MCPyV
virus status and actionable variants in these tumors are re-
quired. In this study, we developed a viral hybrid capture
next-generation sequencing (NGS) method to detect the
presence of integrated MCPyV DNA in FFPE clinical
specimens for routine use in a clinical setting. This ap-
proach was combined with targeted sequencing of several
hundred cancer-related genes to assess oncogenic changes
in the tumor genome. Lastly, we compared the sensitivity
and accuracy of this viral hybrid capture approach to more
traditional approaches, PCR detection of viral DNA, IHC

for detection of MCPyV LT, and synoptic assessment of
MCC pathology.
Methods
Study design and participants
This study included all patients (n = 71) with a reported
diagnosis of MCC at Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women’s
Cancer Center who underwent comprehensive genomic
profiling by OncoPanel between May 2013 and April
2018. OncoPanel version 3 (POPv3) is a custom hybrid
capture assay targeting the exons of 447 genes and 191 re-
gions across 60 genes commonly rearranged in cancer [23,
24]. A retrospective chart review collected demographic,
clinical, disease, treatment, and outcome variables on all
71 patients. For 40 patients, sufficient DNA remained
from the initial OncoPanel profiling or from additional
FFPE tumor specimens to perform POPv3/ViroPanel.
When available, FFPE sections were sectioned for immu-
nohistochemistry with antibodies CM2B4 and Ab3 [17].
Sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin were evalu-
ated by synoptic review [25].
Nucleic acid isolation, library preparation and sequencing
To perform ViroPanel with and without supplementation
with the OncoPanel (v3) bait set, purified DNA was quan-
tified using a Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA assay (Thermo
Fisher). Library construction was performed using 200 ng
of DNA, which was first fragmented to ~ 250 bp using a
Covaris LE220 Focused ultrasonicator (Covaris, Woburn,
MA) followed by size-selected cleanup using Agencourt
AMPureXP beads (Beckman Coulter, Inc. Indianapolis,
IN) at a 1:1 bead to sample ratio. Fragmented DNA was
converted to Illumina libraries using a KAPA HTP library
kit using the manufacturer’s recommendations (Thermo
Fisher). Adapter ligation was done using xGen dual index
UMI adapters (IDT, Coralville, IA).
Samples were pooled in equal volume and run on an
Illumina MiSeq nano flow cell to quantitate the amount of
library based on the number of reads per barcode. All
samples yielded sufficient library (> 250 ng) and were
taken forward into hybrid capture. Libraries were pooled
at equal mass (3 × 17-plex and 1 × 18-plex) to a total of
750 ng. Captures were done using the SureSelectXT Fast
target enrichment assay (Agilent, Technologies, Santa
Clara, CA) with ViroPanel with and without supplementa-
tion with the OncoPanel (v3) bait set. Captures were se-
quenced on an Illumina 2500 in rapid run mode (Illumina
Inc., San Diego, CA).
Sequence alignment and somatic variant calling
Pooled samples were de-multiplexed and sorted using
Illumina’s bcl2fastq software (v2.17). Reads were aligned
to the reference sequence b37 edition from the Human
Genome Reference Consortium as well as viral genomes
targeted by the Virus Capture Baitset v2 using bwa mem
(http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml)
[26].
The
viral genomes and human genome were combined into
one alignment reference so reads could map to the clos-
est matching reference sequence.
Duplicate reads were identified using unique molecular
indices (UMIs) and marked using the Picard tools. The
alignments were further refined using the Genome Ana-
lysis Toolkit (GATK) for localized realignment around
indel sites and base quality score recalibration [27, 28].
Mutation analysis for single nucleotide variants (SNV)
was performed using MuTect v1.1.4 (CEPH control was
used as the “project normal”) and annotated by Variant
Effect Predictor v 79 (VEP) [29, 30]. We used the Somati-
cIndelDetector tool that is part of the GATK for indel
calling. After initial identification of SNVs and indels by
MuTect and GATK respectively, the variants were anno-
tated using OncoAnnotate to determine what genes were
impacted and their effect on the amino acid sequence.
OncoAnnotate also applied additional filters using the Ex-
ome Sequencing Project (ESP) and gnomAD datasets to
flag common SNPs.
Variants that affect protein coding regions underwent
further filtering/classification based on frequency in the
gnomAD, ESP, and COSMIC (version 80) databases. If the
frequency of the variant was less than or equal to 1% in all
gnomAD and ESP populations, the variant was flagged as
“REVIEW_REQUIRED”. If the frequency of the variant
was greater than 1% and less than or equal to 10% in all
gnomAD and ESP populations and present in “COSMIC”
database at least two times, the variant was flagged as “RE-
VIEW_REQUIRED”. If the frequency of the variant was
between 1% and less than or equal to 10% in all gnomAD
and ESP populations and not present in “COSMIC” data-
base at least two times, the variant is flagged as “NO_RE-
VIEW_GERMLINE_FILTER”. If the frequency of the
variant was greater than 10% in any gnomAD and ESP
populations, the variant was flagged as “NO_REVIEW_
GERMLINE_FILTER”. Variants with a frequency greater
than 10% in any gnomAD or ESP population were consid-
ered to be a common SNP irrespective of presence in the
COSMIC database.
Variants in the viral genomes were called using sam-
tools mpileup and bcftools from the aligned bam files.
Called variants were filtered to have a minimum cover-
age of 5 reads and minimum allele frequency of 1% of
total reads covering that base in a single sample. Vari-
ants were annotated based on the NC_010277.2 refer-
ence sequence in GenBank using SnpEff [31].
Recurrent copy number analysis
Copy number variant calling was performed using a com-
bination of VisCap Cancer and CNVkit as previously de-
scribed [32, 33]. All resulting gene copy number variants

Page 3 of 22
from all patients were compared against each other with
UV status and significant mutual exclusivity/co-occurrence
was calculated using Fisher’s exact test corrected by FDR for
multiple comparisons in the R statistical environment. Using
the network and iGraphs packages the significantly co-
occurrent variants were clustered into networks. The genes
belonging to each distinct network cluster with more than
five member genes were then labeled and extracted. Using
these gene lists as cluster definitions, each patient was evalu-
ated for presence or absence of each CNV cluster. Presence
of a CNV cluster was determined if more than 50% of the
member genes of that cluster were modified in the same pa-
tient. Copy number variants from TCGA were retrieved
from cBioPortal (https://www.cbioportal.org/) and plotted
using ggplot2 in the R statistical environment [34, 35].
Viral integration analysis
A custom perl script was written to extract, assemble, an-
notate, and visualize viral reads and determine viral inte-
gration sites. Viral reads and their mates were first
identified and extracted by those that have at least one
mate map to the viral genome. Additional reads contain-
ing viral sequence were identified by a bloom filter con-
structed of unique, overlapping 31 bp k-mers of the
MCPyV genome [36]. The human genome positions for
any read with a mate mapping to the viral genome were
output into a bed file and the orientation of viral and hu-
man pairs was stored to accurately deconvolute overlap-
ping integration sites. This bed file was then merged down
into overlapping ranges based on orientation counting the
number of reads overlapping that range. Skewdness in
coverage of integration junctions was calculated by the
difference in the fraction of virus-host read pairs overlap-
ping the first and second halves of the aforementioned
ranges. This skewdness value was used to determine the
orientation of the viral-host junction (i.e., positive values,
junction is on the 3′ end of the range; negative values,
junction is on the 5′ end of the range), which was vali-
dated from the results of de novo assembly. Integrated
viral genomes were assembled from extracted reads using
SPAdes with default parameters [37]. The assembly graphs
from SPAdes were annotated using blastn against hg19
and the MCPyV reference genome with an e-value cutoff
of 1 × 10−10. Annotated assembly graphs were visualized
using the ggraph R package.
Integrations sites confirmed by reference guided align-
ment and assembly data were analyzed for stretches of
microhomology between the human and viral genomes by
selecting 10 bp upstream and downstream of the integra-
tion junction on the viral and human genomes. Within
these sequences stretches of identical sequence at the
same position longer than two base pairs were counted.
Overall homology between the sequences was calculated
by Levenshtein distance. Three integration junctions with
indeterminate DNA sequence ranging from 1 to 25 bp
inserted between viral and human DNA were excluded
from analysis. Expected microhomology was calculated by
randomly selecting 1000 20 bp pairs of non-N containing
sequence from the human and MCPyV genomes.
Integration site proximity to repeat elements were de-
termined using bedtools closest and repeatmasker anno-
tations acquired from the UCSC genome browser [38].
Expected frequency of integration near repeat elements
was determined by randomly selecting 1000 sites in the
human genome. Sites within 2 kb of a repeat element
were counted as close proximity.
Functional annotation of somatic mutations and viral
integration events was performed using PANTHER
(www.pantherdb.org) [39].
Statistics
The association between relapse and genomic character-
istics are tested with Fisher’s exact test using all patient
sequencing data regardless of primary or recurrence bi-
opsy. Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from
initial diagnosis to death, and patients who did not die
are censored at the last follow-up date. The 95% confi-
dence intervals of the median OS times are estimated
using log(−log(OS)) methodology. Statistical significance
is defined as p ≤0.05.
Associations between recurrent CNV, TMB, or viral
copies and overall survival were calculated and graphed
using GraphPad Prism 7. Fisher’s exact test and Kaplan-
Meier curves were computed with the R statistical envir-
onment. Significant enrichment of microhomology and re-
peat elements at integrations sites was determined using
Fisher’s exact test between observed and expected events.
Human subjects
This study was conducted according to the Declaration
of Helsinki principles and approved by the Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute institutional review board. Written in-
formed consent was received from participants prior to
inclusion in the study.
Results
Summary of patient cohort
A total of 71 patients diagnosed with MCC were in-
cluded in this study (Table 1). The median (95% CI)
follow-up duration from initial diagnosis of MCC was 47
(95% CI: 38–60) months based on inverse Kaplan-Meier
estimation. Overall, 69 enrolled patients were white and
two were black. Forty (56%) patients were male. The me-
dian age was 70 years (range < 50 to 93). The initial site
of MCC presentation was in the head and neck (27%),
upper extremity (20%), lower extremity (21%), and trunk
(32%). The seventh edition TNM staging system of the
American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) was used

to classify the initial presentation of MCC with 27% pre-
senting at stage I, 14% stage II, 42% stage III, and 17%
stage IV.
Somatic variant analysis of targeted sequencing
All 71 patients underwent OncoPanel analysis [32]. Gen-
omic studies were performed using DNA isolated from tu-
mors obtained at the time of initial diagnosis (n=50) or
upon relapse (n=21). The total number of mutations ranged
from 0 to 73 corresponding to a tumor mutational burden
(TMB; mutations/megabase) from 0 to 38.89 with four
cases
containing
no
detectable
mutations
(Fig.
1a,
Additional file 1: Table S1). From this mutation data, pa-
tients
were
binned
into
TMB-high
(≥20),
TMB-
intermediate (> 6 < 20), and TMB-low (≤6). A limited set of
mutation signatures could be identified (see “Methods”).
The UV mutational signature (Signature 7) was detected in
24 cases, corresponding to the TMB-high patients [40].
Additional mutational signatures identified included Aging
(Signature 1; 3 cases), APOBEC (Signatures 2 and 13; 4
cases with 3 that also had an UV signature), and Signature 5
(one case) (Fig. 1a, Additional file 1: Table S1). TMB had
some correlation with the number of copy number altered
genes (Fig. 1b). Several genes including RB1, TP53, KMT2D,
NOTCH1, NOTCH2, and FAT1 were highly enriched for
missense and truncating mutations (Fig. 1c, Additional file 2:
Fig. S1). Single and dinucleotide substitutions in RB1 and
TP53 revealed that most were likely mediated by UV dam-
age (CC > TT, C > T; Fig. 1d).
Copy number variants (CNVs) were examined indi-
vidually as well as against each other and other likely
functional somatic changes for significant co-occurrence
or mutual exclusivity (Additional file 1: Table S2). Clus-
ters of significantly co-occurrent CNVs were determined
via network analysis (Fig. 2a, Additional file 2: Fig. S2 &
Fig. S3). From these analyses, two distinct CNV clusters
were each found to be altered in more than 36% of cases
(Fig. 2b, c). Chromosome 10 (cluster 14) had frequent
copy number loss with 26 tumors showing heterozygous
or homozygous loss of the chromosome (Fig. 2b) [41].
Some cancer-relevant genes on chromosome 10 include
PTEN and SUFU, negative regulators of PI3K and
Hedgehog signaling respectively, with deletions reported
in prior studies of MCC [41, 42]. A region of Chr1q
(cluster 13) was amplified in 28 cases. This region in-
cludes MDM4 (also known as MDMX), whose protein
product cooperates with MDM2 to promote the ubiqui-
tination and subsequent degradation of p53 (Fig. 2b) [43,
44]. In addition, we observed a focal amplification of
MYCL within a greater amplification of Chr1p (cluster
4), which was reported in an earlier study of MCC [45].
CNV clusters 13 and 14 were observed at nearly equal
frequencies in both TMB-high and TMB-low cases
(Fig. 2b, c). Six other CNV clusters were strongly associ-
ated with UV signature and high TMB (Fig. 2c). Func-
tional annotation of the clusters revealed that the two
largest UV-associated CNV clusters (1 and 3) had signifi-
cant enrichment for genes related broadly to DNA dam-
age response and S-phase DNA damage checkpoint likely
enhancing tolerance for UV mutagenesis.
Cluster 5, corresponding to 6p22.3 to 6q26 and likely
representing a gain of the entire chromosome 6, was the
only cluster more than twice as frequent in TMB-low tu-
mors than TMB-high tumors (Fig. 2c). Interestingly, 33.3%
(6/18) of metastatic tumors carried cluster 5 and all but
one of these metastatic tumors were TMB-low MCC. Fur-
thermore, CNV cluster 5 was 2.5 times more frequent in
TMB-low (25%, 11/44) than TMB-high (11%, 2/18) tumors
in primary tumors. Both TMB-low and TMB-high patients
with amplification of CNV cluster 5 had significantly im-
proved overall survival compared to wild type carrying pa-
tients (p = 0.005). Restricting this analysis to only primary
tumors, revealed that there were no deaths at the time of
this study in patients carrying this amplification (p = 0.007)

(Fig. 2d, e). Unsurprisingly, considering the prevalence of
this CNV event in metastatic patients, there was no
difference in recurrence-free survival (RFS, Additional file 2:
Fig. S4).
The recurrent copy number events on chromosomes
1, 6, and 10 were compared within The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) for similarities to other tumor types
(Fig. 2f–h). This analysis revealed that the chromosome
1 (cluster 13) amplification was also frequently observed
in ovarian, breast, and bladder cancers, whereas the
chromosome 10 (cluster 14) loss was most frequently
seen in prostate cancer. Gain of chromosome 6 (cluster
5) was most frequently seen in ovarian, bladder, and
esophago-gastric cancers.
Analysis of viral sequences in tumors
Of the 71 tumors analyzed by OncoPanel, 48 with suffi-
cient remaining material were re-analyzed by OncoPanel
(Profile/OncoPanel version 3, POPv3) combined with a
hybrid-capture probe bait set targeting the entire gen-
ome of MCPyV and other known oncogenic viruses
(ViroPanel). For the 48 cases, the number of MCPyV
reads ranged from 0 to 21,095,751 with only a single
case having zero MCPyV reads (Fig. 3a). In total, 28
cases had substantial reads (> 6800) mapping to the
MCPyV genome that also supported integration of the
virus into the host genome through reads and read pairs
that span integration junctions. For the remaining 20
cases without evidence of integration, the number of
viral reads ranged from 0 to 971. Generally, these cases
had reads that covered less than 10% of the viral genome
with the normalized coverage less than two logs com-
pared to samples with evidence for virus integration
(Fig. 3b, c). Concordantly, the viral reads from most of
these cases were unable to be assembled into larger viral
contigs. Two cases, MCC011 and MCC015, had 212 and
177 MCPyV reads that could be assembled into nine
and five contigs each smaller than 761 base pairs,

respectively. Case MCC007 had the most reads of any
likely virus-negative sample and could be assembled into
a single 5343 bp contig. However, analysis of the point
and deletion variants in these aforementioned viral con-
tigs revealed that they were identical to the virus se-
quence from patient MCC037 indicating that the viral
reads resulted from low-level contamination (< 0.005%
of MCC037 MCPyV reads were detected in other
samples).
For the 28 cases with evidence for integration of the
viral DNA into the tumor, the number of reads mapping
to the viral genome ranged from 6824 to 21,095,751 (me-
dian 28,726). Consistent with previous reports, the inte-
grated viral genome had undergone extensive mutagenesis

with large deletions (> 100 bp) particularly in the 3′ half of
LT as well as in the viral coat protein genes VP1 and VP2
(Fig. 4). In 10 cases, approximately half of the total viral
genome was deleted, 6 cases had approximately 25% of
the viral genome deleted, while 12 cases had sequences
corresponding to the entire or nearly complete genome
(Figs. 3c and 4). In all but one of the cases with a nearly
complete coverage of the viral genome, there was a clonal
point mutation which inserted a premature stop codon in
LT resulting in truncated proteins between 208 and 771
amino acids (Fig. 5a) similar to what has previously been
seen in MCC cell lines and clinical cohorts. In a single
case (MCC054), LT was truncated by a 5-bp deletion
resulting in a frame shift that introduced a premature stop
codon in frame. In all cases, the non-coding control re-
gion, the N-terminal 208 residues of LT, and an intact ST
region of the viral genome were conserved.
Beyond indels and nonsense mutations, LT also car-
ried numerous novel clonal missense mutations (Fig. 5a)
unique to the patients in this cohort. In stark contrast,
ST only had missense mutations at three residues, and
the amino acid change A20S is consistent with a previ-
ously
observed
MCPyV
strain
difference
(GenBank
identical protein accession number: ACI25295.1). The
other missense mutations occurred clonally at H41Y and
N100S once in the entire cohort (Fig. 5b). Neither of
these mutations are present in any of the ST sequences
in GenBank and have not been previously reported.
The integration sites were mapped using the oncovirus
tools suite (https://github.com/gstarrett/oncovirus_tools)
(Fig. 6a, Table 2) [46]. As previously reported, integrations
primarily fell into two categories: either those that appear
as a single integration event or as two events separated by
> 10 kilobases (kb) [8]. Interestingly, two cases had inte-
gration events in non-identical but overlapping sites in
chromosome 1 (Fig. 6b). These represent the first reported
cases of recurrent viral integration sites in MCC.
Based on previous MCC WGS, MCPyV integration
sites frequently coincide with focal amplifications in the
human genome. We can therefore infer that the regions
between distant (> 10 kb) viral integration sites were
amplified; however, no targeted exon were within these
regions [8]. Because of the limited number of capture
targets sequence by the OncoPanel platform, determin-
ing the exact boundaries of the expected virus-mediated
amplifications in cases with junctions < 10 kb apart was

not possible. However, using the normalized viral cover-
age, the estimated number of viral genome copies ranged
between 1 and 1881 copies (median: 7, interquartile
range (IQR) 4–13) (Table 2). When annotating these re-
gions, we observed that they frequently contain enhancer
regions that may contribute to oncogenesis as seen in
HPV-associated tumors [47]. Uniquely, patient MCC026
had integrations in chromosomes 9, 16, and 18, all of
which had integration sites separated by between 107.5
and 129.9 kbp appearing to be distinct events.
Using automated computational methods, we could not
confidently determine an integration site for case MCC037
with the highest viral genome copy number in this study.
Manually interrogating the human sequence hits from the
assembly revealed that it matched a tandem repeat se-
quence flanked by MLT1H2 ERVL-MaLR elements. Based
on the estimated copy number and the assembly graph, the
viral component of this fusion DNA structure is likely
larger than 10 Mbp (Additional file 3: Fig. S6).
With the high depth of coverage facilitated by the
targeted NGS method, high-resolution assemblies for the
integrated virus were generated. Many integrations that
appeared as a single linear contig contained a single copy
of the viral genome flanked by the host genome (Fig. 6c,
Additional file 3: Fig. S6). However, other integrations
generated more complex assembly graphs with a multiple
contigs linked together in a “pigtails” conformation
(Fig. 6d, Additional file 3: Fig. S6). Based on coverage and
conformation, this graph likely represents an integration
event containing partially duplicated viral genome conca-
temers fused to different segments of the human genome.
For samples with distant integration sites, the directional-
ity of the virus-host junctions strongly supports a circular
virus-host DNA fusion intermediate prior to reintegration
into the host chromosome. This model is further sup-
ported by assemblies in which one arm of the fusion con-
tains sequences from both distant sites of the human
genome (Fig. 6e, Additional file 3: Fig. S6).
To address a possible mechanism for integration, we
looked for microhomology between the human and
MCPyV genomes at fusion junctions. We found signifi-
cant enrichment for 4, 5, and 7 bp sequence microho-
mology at the site of integration compared to randomly
selected sites in the human and MCPyV genomes

(Fig. 6f). There was no significant increase in overall
homology between MCPyV and human DNA at integra-
tion
sites

sites.
Patient
MCC027 had the integration site with the longest
stretch of homology, and MCC041 had both the integra-
tion site with the greatest overall homology on its 3′ end
and lowest homology with no microhomology greater
than 1 bp on its 5′ end (Fig. 6g). Additionally, we anno-
tated integration sites for proximity to repeat elements,
including LINEs, SINEs, LTR retrotransposons, and sim-
ple repeats in the human genome. No type of repeat
element was significantly enriched, but all integration
sites were within 1.5 kb of a repeat element and there
was a trend towards integrations near LTR retrotranspo-
sons and low-complexity regions (Fig. 6h).
Distinguishing virus-positive MCC from virus-negative
MCC using somatic variants in comparison to
immunohistochemistry and PCR
Given the striking differences in the number of muta-
tions and mutational signature we observed in the Viro-
Panel
dataset
that
strongly
correlated
with
virus
integration, we compared the data from the OncoPanel
and POPv3/ViroPanel datasets to determine the viral
status of all 71 tumors studied (Table 3). From the
OncoPanel sequencing, we identified off-target reads for
MCPyV in a total of 18/71 cases, ranging from 1 to 194
reads total. When compared to the ViroPanel data, there
was a rough correlation between the number of off-
target reads and the number of MCPyV reads in the Vir-
oPanel dataset. There were 8 samples with MCPyV reads
in the OncoPanel dataset that were not also analyzed by
ViroPanel. None of these 8 cases have any evidence for a
UV mutational signature.
We assessed the total number of mutations, TMB, UV
signature, and detection of MCPyV reads to characterize
each tumor as either virus-positive MCC or virus-negative
MCC. Using these criteria, we called 25 tumors as virus-
negative. All but one of the virus-negative MCC tumors
had a UV mutational signature and had higher number of
total mutations (18–73), higher TMB, and absence of inte-
grated MCPyV compared to virus-positive MCC. The
virus-negative MCC without a UV signature (MCC007)
originally presented as a subcutaneous breast mass [48]. A
total of 46 MCC tumors of the 71 analyzed were character-
ized as virus-positive. These virus-positive MCC had an ab-
sence of UV mutational signature, a lower number of total
mutations (0–16), and lower TMB than did any of the
virus-negative MCC. The TMB-low and -high categories
had perfect concordance with virus-positive and virus-
negative MCC determined by sequencing, respectively.
The
TMB-intermediate
samples
were
mostly
virus-
negative (7/9), but the lowest two TMB patients in this cat-
egory are likely virus-positive based on ViroPanel sequen-
cing and absence of UV mutation signature.
FFPE sections were available for 28 of the 71 cases to
assess for MCPyV LT by IHC with antibodies CM2B4
and Ab3. For 8 of the virus-negative MCC, all were
negative by IHC with both antibodies. For 20 virus-
positive MCC cases, we observed 16 stained positive
with both antibodies and 4 were negative (Table 3). In
addition, DNA was tested by PCR with 5 primer sets for
15 cases. In 9 virus-positive MCC cases, all returned
positive results with 2 to 5 primer sets (Table 3). For 6
virus-negative cases, PCR was negative for 5 primer sets
and one was positive with one primer set. Interestingly,
the virus-negative MCC (MCC007) with one PCR pri-
mer set positive also ranked at the TMB borderline

(9.58) between virus-negative and virus-positive and did
not score as having a UV mutational signature; rather,
the majority of mutations were classified as APOBEC-
associated.
A synoptic review of dermatopathology was available
for 19 cases (Additional file 1: Table S4) [25]. Criteria
evaluated included procedure, site, size (mm), thickness
(mm), lymphovascular invasion, tumor extension, mi-
totic rate, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), growth
pattern, neurotropism, and necrosis (%). TILS were
largely absent in both virus-positive and virus-negative
samples. An infiltrative growth pattern was observed in
virus-positive MCC and nodular or nodular infiltrative
observed in both forms of MCC. Neurotropism was
present in three cases of virus-positive MCC and necro-
sis which ranged from 0 to 40%.
Statistical comparison of clinical and molecular
characteristics
Overall, 28 patients remained disease free after initial
therapy and 43 developed one or more relapses or per-
sisted as stage IV (Additional file 2: Fig. S5). According
to the biopsy type and first relapse status, patients could
be grouped into primary biopsy with no further recur-
rence (N = 30), primary biopsy with further recurrence
(N = 22), and recurrence biopsy (N = 19). For all biopsies
annotated as a recurrence, the first recurrence occurred
before the biopsy was obtained. Among the 19 recur-
rence biopsies, 15 were distant metastatic biopsies, one
local recurrence (MCC027), one unspecified recurrence
(MCC063), one second recurrence (MCC057), and one
local recurrence with no prior chemo/XRT (MCC026).
Regardless of the biopsy type, all patients and sequen-
cing data were grouped into either no relapse (N = 30)
or relapse (N = 41). Table 4 shows the association be-
tween relapse and genomic characteristics. Among 71
patients, 30 (42.3%) patients had no relapse and 41
(57.7%) had relapse after initial diagnosis. From Fisher’s
exact test results, UV, RB1 status, TP53 status, and virus
status were all not significantly associated with relapse
(Table 4). If the OncoPanel data obtained after relapse
(and prior treatment) was excluded and restricted to the
52 patients with primary biopsy, UV, RB1 status, TP53
status, and virus status were all not significantly associ-
ated with relapse (Additional file 1: Table S5).
Consistent with known risk factors of MCC, 10 of the 71
cases had immunosuppression diagnosed prior to develop-
ing MCC. Remarkably, 8 of the 10 (80%) of the immuno-
suppressed cases were identified as virus-negative MCC
with relatively high TMB compared to the 28% virus-
negative MCC in immunocompetent patients (Fig. 7a,
Table 5). Virus-negative MCC was present in three pa-
tients with solid organ transplantation; three with auto-
immune diseases including myasthenia gravis, rheumatoid
arthritis, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis; one with
monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance
(MGUS); and another with Waldenstrom’s macroglobuli-
nemia. In contrast, virus-positive MCC was identified in a
patient with mantle zone lymphoma having been treated
with Rituximab for 3 years and another with germline mu-
tations in NF1 and GATA2 [49]. The median OS for pa-
tients with immunosuppression was 17.5 months (95% CI
5.6–24.4 months), significantly shorter than patients with-
out immunosuppression (48.5 months, 95% CI 35.4–113.3
months, p < 0.01) (Fig. 7b, Table 5). Immunosuppressed
patients also exhibited significantly shorter recurrence-free
survival, 7.5 months (95% CI 3.5–20.1 months) and 20.2
months (95% CI 12.9–50.2 months, p = 0.01), respectively.
We acknowledge that some cases have relatively short
follow-up times that may impact survival analysis; how-
ever, the association of OS and immunosuppression only
shifts slightly after keeping patients with follow-up times
greater than 6 months (n = 63) remaining statistically sig-
nificant. Under this criterion, the median OS for immuno-
competent
and
immunosuppressed
cases
were
48.5
months (95% CI 35.4 to 113.3 months) and 21.6 months
(95% CI 6.9 to 30.7 months, p value < 0.01), respectively.
Discussion
We undertook this study to develop an assay to more
accurately distinguish between virus-positive and virus-
negative MCC by genetic features. We built upon an

NGS platform that has been instituted as a routine part
of clinical care at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,
Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and Boston Children’s
Hospital. The viral hybrid capture assay, ViroPanel, ac-
quired a high number of MCPyV reads for many sam-
ples. Importantly, evidence for specific integration was
associated with all cases with a high number of reads (>
6000). Spurious MCPyV reads were also detected in 19
of 20 MCC cases that were deemed to be virus-negative
by TMB and UV mutations. There was no evidence for
integration in these cases; rather, these reads could be
traced to be extremely low-level contamination from
MCC037 during library preparation or sequencing. In
contrast, true virus-positive MCCs have low TMB with
clear assemblies of virus-host junctions with MCC-
hallmark deletions in the MCPyV genome.
Integration sites were observed in 12 different chro-
mosomes with the most occurring on chromosome 5. In
addition, two fully overlapping integration sites from
two different tumors were observed on chromosome 1
separated by only 10–20 kb. Based on the clonality of de-
letions and point mutations in the MCPyV genome,
these events most likely occurred before or during inte-
gration as was similarly determined from another study
on MCC cell lines [50]. For both MCPyV and HPV, it
has previously been proposed that integration initiates
after DNA double strand breaks in the host genome and
viral genomes, likely during viral genome replication as
integrated viral concatemers are common [8, 51]. In this
study, we identified that integration is then likely medi-
ated through erroneous DNA repair at sites of microho-
mology between the host and viral genomes. This is

similar to mechanisms identified for microhomology-
mediated end joining (MMEJ) for HPV genome integra-
tion in tumors, but it has yet to be determined if the
same host factors are involved [52]. For both MCPyV
and HPV mediated tumors, the MMEJ event frequently
leads to the formation of a transiently circular DNA
intermediate, which can be amplified through aberrant
firing of the viral origin of replication [53]. The resulting
large linear DNA then reintegrates into the chromosome
and appears as amplified regions of the host genome in
a tandem head-to-tail conformation interspersed with
the viral genome [8].
Case MCC026 has three apparently separate integration
events occurring on different chromosomes. The integra-
tion event on chromosome 16 only contains a small sec-
tion of the viral genome from positions 2853–3521, which
would only encode the helicase domain of LT and there-
fore is unlikely to contribute to tumor survival. Conversely,
the event on chromosome 18 has a full copy of the viral
genome while the event on chromosome 9 contains the
NCCR, ST, and a truncated LT, likely sufficient to contrib-
ute to oncogenesis. Based on the assembly graphs and
coverage, one or both of these integration events have
more than one copy of ST and LT (Fig. 4 and Add-
itional file 3: Fig. S6). Distinct sequences derived during as-
sembly and the distances between the intrachromosomal
junctions (107–129kbp) indicate that these likely are separ-
ate events, but only long-read sequencing of this tumor
can definitively determine that these are not part of a larger
interchromosomal translocation.
The most common chromosomal copy number changes
involved chromosomes 1 and 10. Amplification of 1p (clus-
ter 4) involving MYCL was observed more commonly in
virus-negative cases, but was identified in a few virus-
positive cases. Interestingly, in virus-positive MCC, MCPyV
ST binds MYCL and the EP400 chromatin modifying

complex to activate transcription of several hundred target
genes [54]. Amplification of MYCL is likely to be an onco-
genic event that contributes to MCC aggressiveness. Amp-
lification of Chr1q (cluster 13) was also observed in both
virus-positive and virus-negative MCC. This region in-
cludes MDM4, whose protein product cooperates with
MDM2 to promote the ubiquitination and subsequent deg-
radation of p53 [43, 44]. There may be additional pro-
oncogenic genes in this cluster that contribute to MCC
oncogenesis when p53 is mutated. Heterozygous loss of
chromosome 10 (cluster 14) was observed in 26/71 MCC
including both virus-positive and virus-negative tumors.
Loss of chromosome 10 likely reduces PTEN levels con-
tributing to activation of the PI3K signaling pathway.
A recurrent amplification of chromosome 6 has previ-
ously been observed for MCC; however, this observation
predated the discovery of MCPyV and was not associated
with morphology or outcome [55]. In other cancers, such
as basal cell carcinoma and ovarian cancer, this amplifica-
tion is typically associated with worse outcome [55]. Al-
though the chromosome 6 amplification in this study was
significantly associated with better overall survival, it was
also more frequent in metastasis. This amplification con-
tains genes such as VEGFA, which promotes angiogenesis
and has been observed to be expressed at higher levels in
distant ovarian cancer metastases [56]. Interestingly, further
analysis of genes that are more abundantly mutated in the
sequenced metastatic lesions, revealed statistically signifi-
cant (q = 2.47 × 10−7) pathway enrichment for angiogenesis
as well as EGFR signaling and p53 dysregulation. FANCE is
also carried on this chromosome and as a DNA damage re-
sponse gene act to limit number of point mutations and
copy number changes observed in virus-positive MCC, hin-
dering tumor evolution. Together, this amplification co-
occurring with MCPyV may represent a less fatal, but more
metastatic subtype of MCC. Additionally, this result could
be impacted by diagnosis, treatment, or study recruitment
of metastatic MCC.
Unexpectedly, we observed that 8 of 10 cases with im-
munosuppression were virus-negative MCC. While it
was recognized in the early 1990s that individuals with
hematologic malignancies that developed MCC had a
poor prognosis [57], it was not until 1997 when a direct
link between immunosuppression and MCC was postu-
lated [58]. At that time, a correlation was noted between
medically induced immunosuppression with azathio-
prine and cyclosporine and the development and rapid
spread of MCC. Early reports highlighted a prolonged
period of immunosuppression prior to MCC develop-
ment. Notably, the search for a viral pathogen in MCC
was initiated because of reports linking MCC with im-
munosuppression and with HIV-1/AIDS [2]. A subse-
quent report has shown similar rates of MCPyV-
positivity in immunocompetent and suppressed patients,
but relied on PCR and IHC for virus detection [18].
In the present report, three solid organ transplant recip-
ients, three with chronic autoimmune diseases, and two
with hematologic malignancies developed virus-negative

MCC. It is well established that the risk for developing
MCC is increased in patients with chronic inflammatory
disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis or medically in-
duced immunosuppression for solid organ transplantation
[58–61]. Within the latter population, skin cancers ac-
count for 40–50% of all posttransplant malignancies with
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma
(BCC) comprising 90–95% of these skin cancers [62].
Importantly, some therapeutics used in organ transplant-
ation are known to further increase risk for developing
skin cancers. Azathioprine can sensitize cells to UV-
induced damage through the incorporation of a metabol-
ite into DNA that generates reactive oxygen species upon
exposure to UV light [63]. In patients with rheumatoid
arthritis, methotrexate and anti-TNF drugs were associ-
ated with an increased risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer

[64]. The increased risk for skin cancers in organ trans-
plant recipients and rheumatoid arthritis is associated with
UV-light-induced mutagenesis for SCC and BCC. There-
fore, the increased risk for UV-induced skin cancers may
also extend to virus-negative MCC. Although this study is
one of the largest molecular studies on MCC genetics to
date, the small sample size and inherent confounding fac-
tors of studying outcome in a cancer that manifests in
older populations are important limitations. This also
highlights the need for accurate determination of virus sta-
tus and importance to continue to study this rare cancer to
fully address the involvement of immune suppression on
the etiology and outcome of this aggressive cancer.
Despite the significant differences in the TMB between
virus-positive and virus-negative MCC, there were few
phenotypic differences in the two types of MCC. Based
on histopathological features alone, two subtypes of
MCC can be recognized: pure neuroendocrine tumors

and combined tumors with neuroendocrine and diver-
gent (mainly squamous) differentiation. Most pure tu-
mors are MCPyV-positive and CK20-positive
while
combined tumors are uniformly MCPyV-negative and
occasionally CK-20 negative [9, 65]. Virus-negative MCC
can also present as pure neuroendocrine-type MCC.
While genomic sequencing has revealed that virus-
negative MCC has evidence for a high degree of UV
damage, this does not exclude a role for UV exposure in
the development of virus-positive MCC. The relative
lack of UV damaged DNA in virus-positive MCC indi-
cates that the etiologies are clearly different, suggesting
that the precursor to virus-negative MCC was a recipient
of lifelong intense UV exposure while the virus-positive
MCC were not exposed to sunlight for the same degree
or for as long. It was reported that the early promoter of
MCPyV responds to UV exposure and that levels of ST
mRNA increased in UV exposed skin from a healthy hu-
man volunteer [66]. Transient UV exposure could affect
the
immune
response
to
virus-negative
and
virus-
positive MCC etiology. The effect of UV radiation in the
pathogenesis of MCC has been suggested to be more
likely a result of immune modulation rather than direct
effects on DNA itself [67].
Conclusions
Here we present a comprehensive characterization of
the Merkel cell carcinoma genetics using a clinically im-
plemented sequencing platform. This platform was aug-
mented using a hybrid capture baitset against Merkel
cell polyomavirus. From our analyses, we identified CNV
clusters unique to and common to virus-negative and
virus-positive, which reflect the evolutionary mecha-
nisms of the tumors. We also accurately reconstructed
the viral integration events providing clear evidence for
a circular host-fusion DNA intermediate initiated by re-
combination at 4+ bp microhomology enriched at low-
complexity regions in the human genome. Lastly, we ob-
served a surprising number of virus-negative tumors in
immunosuppressed patients in our cohort potentially
reflecting a previously misunderstood risk population.
