Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian inﬂuenza (HPAI) H5N1 and H5N8 have become endemic among
domestic poultry in Egypt since 2006 and 2016, respectively. In parallel, the low pathogenic avian
inﬂuenza H9N2 virus has been endemic since 2010. Despite the continuous circulation of these
subtypes for several years, no natural reassortant has been detected so far among the domestic poultry
population in Egypt. In this study, the HPAI (H5N2) virus was isolated from a commercial duck farm,
giving evidence of the emergence of the ﬁrst natural reassortment event in domestic poultry in Egypt.
The virus was derived as a result of genetic reassortment between avian inﬂuenza viruses of H5N8
and H9N2 subtypes circulating in Egypt. The exchange of the neuraminidase segment and high
number of acquired mutations might be associated with an alteration in the biological propensities of
this virus.

1. Introduction
Highly pathogenic avian inﬂuenza (HPAI) H5N1 and low pathogenic avian inﬂuenza (LPAI) H9N2
viruses have become endemic among domestic poultry in Egypt since 2006 and 2010, respectively [1].
In late 2016, HPAI H5N8 virus of clade 2.3.4.4 (group B) was ﬁrst reported among wild birds in Egypt [2].
Since 2016, HPAI H5N8 viruses have been reported in diﬀerent geographical regions across the country
in both commercial and backyard bird sectors [3,4], where six genotypes have been detected in both
wild and domestic birds [3–5]. Moreover, Egypt reported the highest number of human cases with
HPAI H5N1 virus worldwide, and one of the only three countries (Egypt, China, and Bangladesh) that
reported LPAI H9N2 in humans [1,6]. Recently, simultaneous detection of the three subtypes (H5N1,
H5N8, and H9N2) has been described in a poultry farm in Egypt [7]. The co-circulation of those three

subtypes increases risks for the generation of reassortants with unpredictable phenotypic properties,
including an increased potential threat to human populations. Despite the co-circulation of HPAI
H5N1 and LPAI H9N2 viruses for more than eight years, no natural reassortant has been detected
so far among domestic poultry population in Egypt between those two subtypes. However, the risk
of natural reassortant has been increased after the introduction of the HPAI H5N8 virus in 2016 [1].
This study reports and analyses the genetic and phylogenetic features of the ﬁrst natural reassortant
evidence in domestic poultry in Egypt.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Samples
On 31 December 2018, twenty oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs were collected from a commercial
90-days-old Muscovy duck farm (of 5000 birds) at Mansoura city, Dakahlia governorate, in Egypt.
Samples were taken prior to slaughtering as a part of an active surveillance program conducted by
the National Laboratory for veterinary quality control on poultry production (NLQP) and General
Organization for Veterinary Services. Ducks were vaccinated via an H5N1 vaccine at 7 days old.
Ducks were apparently healthy showing no signs of disease. Collected samples were submitted
to NLQP for virus identiﬁcation and isolation. All experiments in this study were conducted in
accordance with the ethically approved protocol (AHRI-18032019) of the Animal Health Research
Institute, Giza, Egypt.
2.2. RNA Extraction and Molecular Diagnosis
Viral RNA was extracted from the pooled samples using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit
(Qiagen, Gmbh, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Pooled samples
were tested using one step Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)
(Qiagen, Gmbh, Hilden, Germany) for the M gene of inﬂuenza type A viruses [8] using the real-time PCR
Mx3005P QPCR System (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Positive avian inﬂuenza virus (AIV) RNA was
subtyped for hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) using speciﬁc subtyping RT-qPCR [9,10].
2.3. Virus Isolation
Virus isolation was performed via inoculation into the allantoic cavity of 10-day-old speciﬁc
pathogen free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs (ECE) according to the World Organization for Animal
Health (OIE) diagnostic manual [11]. Collected allantoic ﬂuid was tested using an hemaglutination
assay and speciﬁc RT-qPCRs [9,10]. HA-positive allantoic ﬂuids were stored at −80 ◦C.
2.4. Gene Sequencing
The complete genome sequences of the Egyptian virus A/duck/Egypt/VG1099/2018 (EG-VG1099)
was ampliﬁed using RT-PCR with SuperScript-III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum® Taq
DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) with primers described previously [12,13].
The gene-speciﬁc RT-PCR amplicons were size-separated using agarose gel electrophoresis, excised,
and puriﬁed from gels using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Gmbh, Hilden, Germany).
Further, puriﬁed PCR products were used directly for cycle sequencing reactions using the BigDye
Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Reaction products
were puriﬁed using Centrisep spin columns (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA) and sequenced on
an ABI 3500XL Genetic Analyzer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Sequences generated in this
study were submitted to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Inﬂuenza Data (GISAID) platform under
accession number: EPI1387245-52.

2.5. Genetic and Phylogenetic Characterization
The obtained sequences were assembled and edited using the Geneious® software, version
11.0.5 [14]. A Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) search was performed using Global
Initiative on Sharing All Inﬂuenza Data (GISAID) platform, and sequences used in this study
have been retrieved from the GISAID database for representative H5N8, H9N2, and other similar
viruses. Alignment and identity matrix analyses were done using Multiple Alignment using Fast
Fourier Transform (MAFFT) [15]. Phylogenetic analyses were based on a maximum likelihood
methodology based on Bayesian (BIC) criterion after selection of the best ﬁt models using IQ-tree
software version 1.1.3 [16]. Trees were ﬁnally viewed and edited using FigTree v1.4.2 software
(http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/ﬁgtree/).
3. Results
3.1. Virus Isolation
Pooled samples were found positive for the inﬂuenza A H5N2 subtype and negative for H7 and
H9, as well as N1 and N8. Ducks were apparently healthy with neither disease symptoms nor abnormal
mortalities. The virus was isolated, conﬁrmed, and named A/duck/Egypt/VG1099/2018 (EG-VG1099).
3.2. Genetic and Phylogenetic Characterization
The complete genome sequences of the Egyptian virus EG-VG1099 were obtained and sequences
generated in this study were submitted to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Inﬂuenza Data
(GISAID) platform under the accession number: EPI1387245-52. Nucleotide identity analysis
showed that the EG-VG1099 virus was closely related, according to its hemagglutinin (HA)
gene segment, to HPAI H5N8 viruses isolated in Europe 2016–2017, with a nucleotide sequence
identity of 98% to the A/Eur_Wig/NL-Greonterp/16015653-001/2016; the same identity of 98%
with A/duck/Egypt/F446/2017(H5N8) virus was also recorded. The neuraminidase (NA) gene
of the EG-VG1099 virus shared 97% nucleotide identity with the Egyptian LPAI H9N2 virus
A/chicken/Egypt/D10700/2015(H9N2) (Table 1), and no identity with any virus outside Egypt in
the ﬁrst 200 hits was observed. Six segments—polymerase basic (PB2), PB1, polymerase acidic
(PA), nucleoprotein (NP), matrix protein (M), nonstructural protein (NS)—revealed a nucleotide
identity of 98%–99% with the Dutch (A/Eur_Wig/NL-Greonterp/16015653-001/2016) and Italian
(A/swan/Italy/17VIR537-2/2017) HPAI H5N8 viruses (Table 1). Possible reassortment option of the
novel Egyptian HPAI H5N2 virus is illustrated in Figure 1C.

and possible reassortment option of the novel HPAI H5N2 virus found in Egypt in 2018.
Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene segment showed that the EG-VG1099 virus was closely
related to HPAI H5N8 viruses reported in Europe during 2016–2017 (2.3.4.4 clade, group B),
and phylogenetically distinguished from the previously reported HPAI H5N8 viruses in Egypt
(Figure 1A). The NA gene segment of EG-VG1099 was phylogenetically grouped with the LPAI H9N2
viruses isolated from Egypt (Figure 1B). The remaining six genes (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M, and NS) of the
EG-VG1099 virus were clustered with Egyptian HPAI H5N8 viruses: A/chicken/Egypt/Gharbiya-15/2017
and A/duck/Egypt/F446/2017, and revealed a close phylogenetic relatedness with H5N8 viruses
frequently found in Europe in 2016–2017 (Figure 2).
The HA gene of the EG-VG1099 virus possessed multiple basic amino acids, “PLREKRRKR/GLF”,
in the cleavage site of the HA indicating high pathogenicity of this virus. The EG-VG1099 virus
exhibited R76S, S98R, A138S, A160V, and R173Q amino acid substitutions (H3 numbering) at its HA
protein, distinguishing it from previously reported HPAI H5N8 viruses of clade 2.3.4.4 (group B).
Amino acid substitutions at positions S98R, A138S, and A160V have been reported previously to be
related to virulence and host speciﬁcity [17,18]. The NA coded protein of the emerged HPAI H5N2
virus was distinguished by 43 nucleotide mutations from the Egyptian LPAI H9N2 viruses (during
2010–2016, no available published sequence hereafter). Twelve out of the 43 were non-synonymous
and encoded amino acid substitutions: F37L, T43A, V50E, K143E, R199K, M210I, L211I, R283Q, R288I,
R344V, N384K, and K415R. Positions 143 and 344 were located in the antibodies recognition sites of
the NA coded protein [19,20]. However, none of the remaining amino acid substitutions have been
described in association with resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors or located in the hemadsorption
site. Further, the Egyptian EG-VG1099 possessed no mutations at known molecular features associated
with virulence or host adaptation, like E627K and D701N in PB2, N375S and L598P in PB1, or V100A in
PA [17]. However, N30D and T215A amino acid substitutions in the M1 protein and P42S in the NS1
protein (previously reported in the Egyptian H5N8 viruses) were observed, suggesting that the virus
could exhibit increased virulence in mammals [17].

4. Discussion
Currently, Egypt faces endemic co-circulation of HPAI (H5N1, H5N8) and LPAI (H9N2) viruses,
where a simultaneous detection of the three subtypes has been detected [7]. The co-circulation of those
three subtypes raises fears for the generation of a new subtype/genotype with unpredictable properties,
including an increased potential threat to human [1]. However, the nucleotide identity and phylogenetic
distance of the Egyptian HPAI H5N2 virus (EG-VG1099) virus with other Egyptian HA genes seems
low, and it is reasonable to suggest that the new reassortant EG-VG1099 resulted from a reassortant
between HPAI H5N8 virus of clade 2.3.4.4 (group B) and the Egyptian LPAI (H9N2) virus of the G1-like
lineage (Figure 1C). This was supported by the phylogenetic relatedness of the NA gene segment with
only viruses isolated from Egypt; however, the circulation of an additional variant of H5N8 in Egypt
cannot be excluded. So far, no natural reassortant has been detected between the Egyptian H5N1/H9N2
subtypes [21], and the emerged H5N2 virus in this study indicated a higher reassortment compatibility
Viruses 2019, 11, 565
7 of 8
between the Egyptian H5N8 and H9N2 viruses compared to the Egyptian H5N1/H9N2. However,
we cannot exclude the detection of new genotypes with diﬀerent gene constellations in the upcoming
period. This highlights the signiﬁcance of obtaining the whole genome sequence of the circulating
HPAI H5N1/H5N2/H5N8 viruses in Egypt.
Further, diﬀerent amino acid substitutions associated with either virulence or host adaptation
have been observed in the newly detected Egyptian HPAI H5N2 virus (EG-VG1099). Amino acid
substitutions (S98R, A138S, and A160V) in the antibody recognition sites of the HA have been observed.
These mutations were described to enhance the binding of AIV H5 with the α2.6 sialic acid receptor
and increase virulence in the mammalian animal model [17,18]. Further, N30D and T215A amino acid
substitutions in the M1 protein of the EG-VG1099 virus were reported to enhance the virulence of the
HPAI H5N1 virus in mice [17]. In addition, P42S in the NS1 protein also has been found to increase
the virulence of the HPAI H5N1 virus in mice [17]. Interestingly, a high number of non-synonymous
nucleotide mutations (n = 12) in the NA have been noticed. Only positions 143 and 344 are located in
the antibody recognition sites of the NA coded protein and have been reported in the literature to be
related to the antigenic drift/escape mutant [19,20]. However, none of the rest have been described in
association with resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors or located in the hemadsorption site. At this
point, it cannot be excluded that the new HPAI H5N2 subtype, reported in this study, may be associated
with an alternation in the biological propensities. Hence, future studies in birds (e.g., chickens, ducks)
and mammalian models (e.g., ferrets, mice) is recommended to provide experimental data on the
ﬁtness and virulence of this virus subtype. In addition, in vivo and in vitro studies comparing the
newly detected H5N2 virus to a closely related H5N8 virus are required to determine any alteration in
the phenotypic properties between the two viruses.
Moreover, our study underlines the importance of active surveillance in the timely detection of
new AIV subtypes. It can be expected that continuing surveillance activities might lead to the detection
of additional new cases; hence, surveillance should be strengthened with special emphasis in the
surrounding regions of the outbreak. Interventions, like improved biosecurity practices in poultry
production enterprises, and live bird trading and marketing practices in Egypt, should be considered
to reduce the dissemination of AIV and reduce the chance of reassortment raised through co-infection.
