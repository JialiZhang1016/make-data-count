Abstract
Background: Microglia are innate immune cells of the brain that perform phagocytic and inflammatory functions
in disease conditions. Transcriptomic studies of acutely-isolated microglia have provided novel insights into their
molecular and functional diversity in homeostatic and neurodegenerative disease states. State-of-the-art mass
spectrometry methods can comprehensively characterize proteomic alterations in microglia in neurodegenerative
disorders, potentially providing novel functionally relevant molecular insights that are not provided by
transcriptomics. However, comprehensive proteomic profiling of adult primary microglia in neurodegenerative
disease conditions has not been performed.
Methods: We performed quantitative mass spectrometry based proteomic analyses of purified CD11b+ acutely-
isolated microglia from adult (6 mo) mice in normal, acute neuroinflammatory (LPS-treatment) and chronic
neurodegenerative states (5xFAD model of Alzheimer’s disease [AD]). Differential expression analyses were
performed to characterize specific microglial proteomic changes in 5xFAD mice and identify overlap with LPS-
induced pro-inflammatory changes. Our results were also contrasted with existing proteomic data from wild-type
mouse microglia and from existing microglial transcriptomic data from wild-type and 5xFAD mice.
Neuropathological validation studies of select proteins were performed in human AD and 5xFAD brains.
Results: Of 4133 proteins identified, 187 microglial proteins were differentially expressed in the 5xFAD mouse
model of AD pathology, including proteins with previously known (Apoe, Clu and Htra1) as well as previously
unreported relevance to AD biology (Cotl1 and Hexb). Proteins upregulated in 5xFAD microglia shared significant
overlap with pro-inflammatory changes observed in LPS-treated mice. Several proteins increased in human AD
brain were also upregulated by 5xFAD microglia (Aβ peptide, Apoe, Htra1, Cotl1 and Clu). Cotl1 was identified as a
novel microglia-specific marker with increased expression and strong association with AD neuropathology. Apoe
protein was also detected within plaque-associated microglia in which Apoe and Aβ were highly co-localized,
suggesting a role for Apoe in phagocytic clearance of Aβ.
Conclusions: We report a comprehensive proteomic study of adult mouse microglia derived from acute
neuroinflammation and AD models, representing a valuable resource to the neuroscience research community. We
highlight shared and unique microglial proteomic changes in acute neuroinflammation aging and AD mouse
models and identify novel roles for microglial proteins in human neurodegeneration.

Background
Microglia are the primary innate immune cells of the cen-
tral nervous system (CNS). These yolk sac-derived mye-
loid
cells
take
up
residence
in
the
CNS
during
embryogenesis [1]. Microglia perform both homeostatic
functions such as synaptic pruning and environmental
sensing and under disease states, can adopt transcription-
ally distinct profiles that can mediate both neurotoxic as
well as neuroprotective and phagocytic roles [2–4]. In
aging and in chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as
Alzheimer’s
disease
(AD),
microglia
adopt
unique
disease-associated-microglial (DAM) transcriptional pro-
files and it is suspected that DAM can mediate phagocytic
clearance of amyloid beta (Aβ), a process that becomes
progressively dysregulated and ineffective with disease
progression [5, 6]. Although transcriptional profiling pro-
vides
an
in-depth
understanding
of
gene-expression
changes in disease, modest agreement between transcrip-
tional level changes and protein level changes have been
observed across various studies and cell types [7, 8]. Since
functional phenotypes are largely mediated by protein
effectors, proteomic studies should provide an important
perspective for understanding pathophysiological changes
that result in neurodegeneration. Recent advances in mass
spectrometry methods have made deep proteomic profil-
ing of relatively smaller numbers of cells feasible [9].
The proteome of microglia from young and aging
wild-type (WT) mice has been described [8, 10], and more
recently, a limited proteomic analysis of acutely-isolated
microglia
from
the
5xFAD
mouse
model
of
AD
pathology identified early pro-inflammatory microglial
activation prior to Aβ deposition [11]. However, com-
prehensive and comparative proteomic studies of adult
microglia under homeostatic conditions, acute neuroin-
flammatory
and
chronic
neurodegenerative
disease
states have not been reported. We report the deepest
quantitative and most comprehensive proteome of
acutely isolated microglia derived from adult mice and
from mouse models of acute neuroinflammation and
AD pathology. We report unexpected similarities be-
tween murine models of acute neuroinflammation and
chronic neurodegeneration, in addition to highlighting
unique
neurodegeneration-specific
immune
changes
seen in 5xFAD mice. We also highlight the complemen-
tary nature of transcriptomic and proteomic data in un-
derstanding the dynamic nature of microglial gene and
protein expression changes under different in-vivo con-
ditions.
Furthermore,
we
identify
unappreciated
microglia-specific markers relevant to human AD as
and suggest novel AD-relevant biology for proteins that
were not thought to be expressed by microglia. There-
fore, this microglial proteome represents a valuable re-
source to the neuroimmunology and neurodegenerative
disease research communities, serving as a reference
for future comprehensive immune profiling and target
validation studies.
Methods
Animals
Female C57BL/6 J and female 5xFAD mice (on a
C57BL/6 J background) used for the studies were housed
in the Department of Animal Resources at Emory
University
under
standard
conditions.
Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee approval was obtained
prior to in-vivo work and all work was performed in
strict accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.
Adult mice were given intraperitoneal LPS injections
(10 μg/dose × 4 daily doses) to induce acute neuroin-
flammation [12, 13]. If ≥25% of weight loss was ob-
served, animals were euthanized. Three groups of adult
6–7 mo old C57BL/6 J mice (n = 3 pools each, 2 mouse
brains per pool) were used for our studies. Wild-type
(WT) mice (untreated), WT mice treated with LPS for 4
consecutive days (IP, 20 μg/dose) and 5xFAD mice were
euthanized followed by cardiac perfusion as previously
described [13].
Acute isolation and enrichment of CD11b+ microglia and
brain mononuclear phagocytes
The brain was dissected and brain mononuclear cells
were isolated as previously described by Percoll gradient
centrifugation [13]. Mechanical homogenization of the
brain was performed rather than enzymatic digestion
due to two reasons: i) in our experience, live microglial
cell yield using enzymatic or mechanical dissociation
methods are very similar (≈200,000 mononuclear cells
per brain), and ii) enzymatic digestion may cleave cell
surface
proteins,
thereby
potentially
decreasing
the
likelihood of identifying cell surface proteins by mass
spectrometry. Isolated cells were then further purified by
CD11b positive selection using a MACS column (Miltenyi
Biotec Cat#130–093-636) to selectively enrich microglia
and brain mononuclear phagocytes. Positive selection
enriched the CD11b+ population from 60 to 95% as
confirmed by flow cytometry. On average, 200,000 live
CD11b+ cells were isolated from each brain. Whole cell
microglial
lysates
were
prepared
and
processed
for
analysis.
Sample preparation for mass spectrometry analysis
Cell pellets were flash frozen and stored at −80 °C until
ready for protein extraction. Cells were lysed in 8 M
urea lysis buffer (8 M urea, 100 mM NaHPO4, pH 8.5)
with HALT protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail
(ThermoFisher). Each sample was then sonicated for
3 cycles consisting of 5 s of active sonication at 30%
amplitude followed by 15 s on ice. Samples were then

centrifuged for 5 min at 15,000 g and the supernatant
was transferred to a new tube. Protein concentration
was determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay
(Pierce) and 20 μg of each sample was aliquoted.
Protein digestion and sample cleanup was performed
as previously published [14]. Briefly, protein samples
were reduced with 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) for 30
mins, alkylated with 5 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) in the
dark for another 30 mins and then 8-fold diluted with
50
mM
triethylammonium
bicarbonate
(TEAB).
Overnight digestion was performed with 1:100 (w/w)
Lysyl endopeptidase (Wako) followed by an additional
12-h digestion with Trypsin at 1:50 (w/w). The peptide
solutions were acidified, and desalted with a C18 Sep-Pak
column (Waters). A 2 μg equivalent of each sample
elution was pooled and used to create a global internal
standard (GIS) and all samples were dried under vacuum.
Tandem mass tag (TMT) peptide labeling was per-
formed according to manufacturer’s instructions and as
previously described [14]. One batch of 10-plex TMT
kits (Thermo Fisher) was used to label the 9 samples
and one GIS mixtures. In this batch, TMT channel 131
was used to label the GIS standard, while the 9
remaining TMT channels were used to label each indi-
vidual sample. Electrostatic repulsion-hydrophilic inter-
action chromatography (ERLIC) offline fractionation was
performed as previously described [14, 15]. Briefly, dried
samples were re-suspended in 100 μL of ERLIC buffer A
(90% acetonitrile with 0.1% acetic acid) and separated on
a PolyWAX LP column (20 cm by 3.2 mm packed with
300 Å 5 μm beads (PolyLC Inc.) and elution fractions
were recovered over a 45-min gradient from 0 to 50%
ERLIC buffer B (30% ACN with 0.1% FA). The original
44 fractions were combined as previously described into
21 and dried under vacuum [14, 15].
Mass spectrometry analysis and TMT data acquisition
Assuming equal distribution of peptide concentration
across all ERLIC fractions, 10 μL of loading buffer (0.1%
TFA) was added to each of the fractions and 2 μL was
separated on a 25 cm long by 75 μm internal diameter
fused silica column (New Objective, Woburn, MA)
packed in-house with 1.9 μm Reprosil-Pur C18-AQ resin.
The
LC-MS/MS
platform
consisted
of
a
Dionex
RSLCnano UPLC coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion mass
spectrometer with a Flex nano-electrospray ion source
(Thermo Fisher). Sample elution was performed over a
gradient of 3 to 30% Buffer B (0.1% formic acid in ACN)
over 105 mins (flow rate started at 300 nl/min and
ended at 350 nl/min), from 30 to 60% B over 20 mins at
350 nl/min, and from 60 to 99% B over 5 mins at
350 nl/min. The column was equilibrated with 1% B for
10 min at a flow rate that increased from 350 nl/min to
400 nl/min. The MS was operated in positive ion mode
and
utilized
the
synchronous
precursor
selection
(SPS)-MS3 method for reporter ion quantitation as
described [14]. The full scan range was 380–1500 m/z
at a nominal resolution of 120,000 at 200 m/z and
automatic
gain
control
(AGC)
set
to
2 × 105.
Collision-induced dissociation (CID)-Tandem MS/MS
at 35% normalized collision energy (CE) and higher
energy collision dissociation (HCD) SPS-MS3 at 65%
normalized collision energy (CE) were collected at top
speed with 3 s cycles. For SPS, the top 10 product ions
were notched and fragmented.
Protein identification and quantification
Raw data files from Orbitrap Fusion were processed
using Proteome Discover (version 2.1). Collected MS/
MS spectra were searched against the UniProt mouse
proteome database (54,489 total sequences). SEQUEST
parameters were specified as: trypsin enzyme, two
missed cleavages allowed, minimum peptide length of
6, TMT tags on lysine residues and peptide N-termini
(+ 229.162932 Da) and carbamidomethylation of cyst-
eine residues (+ 57.02146 Da) as fixed modifications,
oxidation of methionine residues (+ 15.99492 Da) and
deamidation of asparagine and glutamine (+ 0.984 Da)
as a variable modification, precursor mass tolerance of
20 ppm, and a fragment mass tolerance of 0.6 Da. Pep-
tide spectral match (PSM) error rates were determined
using the target-decoy strategy coupled to Percolator
[16] modeling of true and false matches. Reporter ions
were quantified from MS3 scans using an integration
tolerance of 20 ppm with the most confident centroid
setting. An MS2 spectral assignment false discovery
rate (FDR) of less than 1% was achieved by applying the
target-decoy strategy. Following spectral assignment,
peptides were assembled into proteins and were further
filtered based on the combined probabilities of their
constituent peptides to a final FDR of 1%. In cases of
redundancy, shared peptides were assigned to the pro-
tein sequence with the most matching peptides, thus
adhering to principles of parsimony. The search results
and TMT quantification as well as raw LC-MS/MS files
are included in the ProteomeXchange online repository
with identifier PXD009137. Even though TMT labeling
limits missing values, normalized abundances were zero
for some channels in the dataset, up to 3 out of the 9
channels
representing
individual
samples.
Missing
values were imputed according to the informative
missing-ness assumption, such that these values fit into
the left tail of the population-wide Gaussian distribu-
tion, with a mean 1.8 population-wide standard devia-
tions less than the mean for non-missing data, and
randomness of the imputed population was allowed to
vary within ±0.3-fold of the same standard deviation.

Gene ontology enrichment analysis and visualization,
pathway analysis and identification of upstream
transcriptional regulators
Functional enrichment of the differentially expressed
proteins was determined using the GO-Elite (v1.2.5)
python package [17]. The set of total proteins identified
and quantified (n = 4133) was used as the background.
Input lists included proteins significantly differentially
expressed (p < 0.05 by Student’s t test) comparing either
5xFAD vs WT or LPS-treated WT vs untreated WT
mouse microglial proteomic data. Z-score determines
over-representation of ontologies and Fisher’s exact test
p-value was used to assess the significance of the
Z-score. GO Elite v1.2.5 command line application with
Z score cutoff of 1.96 and minimum 5 genes per ontol-
ogy identified ontology enrichments for LPS or AD
model-affected proteins, similar to our previously pub-
lished method [18]. Enrichment Map v2.1.0 Cytoscape
plugin
[19]
was
called
from
Cytoscape
v3.5.1
on
DAVID-formatted GO-Elite pruned Z-Score output ta-
bles. Edge connectivity (Jaccard similarity metric) ranges
from 0 (white) to 1 (dark red or blue). Ontology network
node colors represent the degree of average log2 fold
change for all differentially expressed members of the
ontology in the AD-WT and LPS-WT/CT networks.
Since no overlap of gene symbols occurs between differ-
ential expression list-derived up and down subnetworks,
respectively red and blue subnetworks were overlaid to
produce
the
visualizations
shown.
Differentially
expressed protein lists were also used for bioinformatics
analysis (MetaCore software, Thomson Reuters) includ-
ing
pathway
analyses
to
identify
over-represented
molecular and metabolic pathways as well to identify
potential upstream transcriptional regulators as previ-
ously described [20].
Immunofluorescence microscopy
For mouse tissue, brains were harvested after cardiac
perfusion with ice cold saline, followed by 4% parafor-
maldehyde. After overnight fixation, brains were trans-
ferred to 30% sucrose for 24 h after which 30 μm
sections were obtained using a cryostat. For all immuno-
histochemistry studies, three sagittal fixed brain sections
from wild-type and 5xFAD mice from equivalent regions
were placed on each slide to control for any heterogen-
eity in staining. For Aβ retrieval, sections were treated
with 70% formic acid for 10 min, washed in buffer,
blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide and 10 μg/ml of
Avidin for 30 min and then blocked in 10% normal
horse serum prepared in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for
30 min followed by overnight incubation with primary
antibody (anti-Aβ42 4G8 antibody [Signet, Cat # 9220–
02] 1:1000, anti-Apoe antibody [Meridian Life Science,
Cat # K74180B] 1:100 [21], anti-Iba1 antibody [Abcam
ab178846], anti-GFAP [Millipore Sigma, Cat # MAB360]
1:100, anti-CD68 [Abcam ab955] 1:100). Sections were
rinsed in TBS and then incubated in the appropriate
fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody (1:500) for
30 min after which tissues were mounted on slides, dried
and mounted with mounting medium containing DAPI
for nuclear staining (Fluoreshield, Sigma-Aldrich F6057).
Confocal microscopy was performed on Leica SP8 multi
photon microscope and all image processing was per-
formed using Imaris software. For co-localization analyses,
appropriate thresholds for each channel were determined
using appropriate negative controls. Immunofluores-
cence microscopy was performed on an immunofluor-
escence microscope (Microscope: Olympus BX51 and
camera: Olympus DP70) and image processing was per-
formed using ImageJ.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
Cryopreserved pathology-confirmed AD (n = 3) and age-
and sex-matched non-disease control (n = 3) frontal cor-
tex tissues were obtained from the Emory Neuropatho-
logical core and sectioned using a cryotostat (30 μm
slice thickness). Endogenous peroxidase was quenched
with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min and then the
sample was blocked with 10% normal goat serum/0.4%
Triton
X-100/Tris-buffered
saline
(TBS)
for
1
h,
followed by avidin/biotin binding (Vector labs SP2001)
per manufacturer’s instructions, followed by overnight
incubation with primary antibodies (anti-Cotl1 [Sig-
ma-Aldrich HPA008918, also validated in the Human
Protein Atlas] rabbit polyclonal Ab 1:100) [22]. Sections
were rinsed with TBS and incubated with appropriate
biotin-conjugated
secondary
antibody
followed
by
Vectastain Elite ABC and diaminobenzidine (DAB) as
per manufacturer’s recommendations. To exclude non-
specific staining unrelated to polyclonal and monoclonal
antibodies, immunostaining was performed with omis-
sion of the antibodies but with all other procedures
unchanged.
Slides
were
lastly
counterstained
with
hematoxylin. Light microscopy was performed with an
Olympus light microscope (Olympus, Center Valley,
PA). Images acquired from 4 AD cases and 4 non-AD/
non-disease post-mortem cases (frontal cortex) were
used for quantitative analysis to compare Cotl1 immu-
noreactivity (ImageJ software) as described [23].
Existing proteomic and transcriptomic datasets used for
comparative analyses
Primary microglial proteomics data
An existing proteome of acutely isolated and purified
microglia as well as other brain cell types (neurons,
astrocytes and oligodendroglia) [8] was used as a refer-
ence proteome. Although mice used for our study were
significantly older (6–7 mo) compared to this previously
Rangaraju et al. Molecular Neurodegeneration  (2018) 13:34 
Page 4 of 19
published work (8 weeks), we used this existing prote-
ome as a reference to identify microglial-specific pro-
teins as well as the most abundant proteins identified in
microglia. We also referenced this dataset to serve as a
background of all identifiable proteins in mouse brain.
Purified microglial transcriptomics
CD11b+ microglia microarray datasets from wild-type
and 5xFAD mice were obtained from GEO dataset
GSE65067 [24]. Existing RNAseq datasets comparing
wild-type to LPS-treated mice were also obtained [25].
Differentially expressed genes were contrasted with ob-
served
differentially
expressed
proteins
comparing
wild-type to LPS-treated wild-type microglia as well as
comparing wild-type vs. 5xFAD microglia.
Human post-mortem brain proteomics data
Protein expression data were obtained from ProteomeX-
change
(http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/
cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD007160)
[14].
In
this
study,
TMT mass spectrometry was used to identify 10,230
proteins across AD, Parkinson’s disease and non-disease
control post-mortem brain (frontal cortex) tissues. Pro-
tein expression data from AD (n = 10) and non-disease
controls (n = 10) were used for differential expression
analyses, which were then used for comparison with the
current mouse microglial proteome.
Other statistical considerations
Graphpad Prism (Ver. 5), Microsoft Excel and SPSS
(Ver. 22) were used to create graphs and perform
statistical analyses. All data are shown as mean ± SEM.
Pairwise two-tailed t-tests were performed in unadjusted
analyses comparing groups. Statistical significance was
set at p value ≤0.05 for all experiments unless specified
separately.
Results
Quantitative proteomics of acutely isolated adult mouse
microglia reveals a highly metabolically active phenotype
To describe the proteome of adult mouse microglia, we
analyzed whole cell lysates of acutely isolated CD11b+
MACS-purified microglia isolated from brains of 6–7
mo old wild-type (WT) mice treated with saline or
intra-peritoneal LPS for 4 days to induce neuroinflam-
mation [13], as well as from 5xFAD mice (Fig. 1a, 2
brains pooled per sample, n = 3 samples per group) [26].
MACS purification resulted in > 95% enrichment of
CD11b+
CNS
immune
cells
(Fig.
1b).
Among
CD11b-enriched cells, CD45high mononuclear phagocytes
accounted for only 1.3, 2.1 and 4.1% cells in untreated WT,
LPS-treated WT and 5xFAD mice respectively (Fig. 1c)
confirming minimal contamination by CNS-infiltrating
macrophages. Microglial whole-cell lysates in 8 M urea
buffer were digested by LysC and trypsin, followed by la-
beling of peptides with TMT reagents, admixture of the
TMT 10-plex peptides, followed identification and syn-
chronous precursor selection based MS3 (SPS-MS3) mass
spectrometry reporter quantitation (Fig. 1d), and then dif-
ferential expression and comparative analyses (Fig. 1e).
We obtained a total of 31,865 unique peptides that
mapped to 4259 unique mouse gene symbols. Of these,
4133 proteins were identified across the three groups
(see Additional File 1: Table S1).. Not allowing any miss-
ing values, 3598 proteins were quantified. The distribu-
tion of protein abundance was highly skewed such that
5% of proteins (n = 211) accounted for 50% of the cumu-
lative protein weight in the samples (Fig. 2a). Most of
these highly abundant proteins were housekeeping and
cytoskeletal proteins such as Atp1a3 (α3 subunit of Na+/
K+ ATPase), Sptan1 (α spectrin), Actb (β actin), Sptbn1
(β spectrin) and Tubb4b (beta4 tubulin). Using a previ-
ously
published
purified
mouse
brain
and
cell
type-specific proteome as a reference (7,198 identified
and quantified proteins) [8], 3379 proteins identified in
our dataset were also identified in the reference micro-
glial proteome. Of these, 156 proteins were highly abun-
dant (≥90th percentile of abundance) in both datasets.
Overall, there was modest correlation of expression
levels between the reference microglial proteome and
our microglial proteome (Fig. 2b, Spearman’s rank cor-
relation R = 0.28 for all proteins in common, Spearman’s
R = 0.23 for the top 25th percentile in common). This
modest correlation suggests possibility of methodo-
logical and age-related differences in microglial protein
expression and myelination, since our proteome was de-
rived from significantly older mice (26–30 weeks of age)
as compared to the reference proteome (8–9 weeks of
age). In the reference proteome, 633 microglia-specific
proteins were also identified as having highest expres-
sion in microglia as compared to neurons or other glial
cells. Of these, 189 proteins were identified in our
microglial dataset. Among the most highly abundant
proteins in both microglial proteomes (≥80th percentile
of
abundance),
17
proteins
also
met
criteria
for
microglia-specific expression (Fig. 2c). These proteins
consistent across two independent datasets (including
Myh9, Msn, Coro1a, Cotl1 and Bin1), represent the
most highly abundant and microglial-specific proteins in
mice.
We also performed gene ontology (GO) enrichment
analyses on the entire list of 4133 proteins and identi-
fied 180 significant GO terms (adjusted p-value < 0.05).
The top 10 GO terms for each category are shown in
Fig. 2d (also see Additional file 2: Table S2). This GO
analysis
shows
that
our
microglial
proteome
was
enriched for cytosolic/cytoplasmic proteins involved in
transport and several catabolic, nucleotide/nucleoside

metabolic and mitochondrial processes. Interestingly,
“neuron projection” and “synapse” were also identified
as significantly enriched GO terms in this dataset,
which may be explained by the known role of microglia
in neuronal synaptic pruning [27, 28]. WikiPathways
enriched in our microglial proteome included electron
transport chain, oxidative phosphorylation/TCA cycle,
proteasome
degradation,
glycolysis/gluconeogenesis,
fatty acid beta oxidation and G protein signaling path-
ways (Fig. 2e, Additional file 2: Table S2). Results from
GO analyses were not affected by the choice of back-
ground proteins used (all known mouse gene symbols
or 11,937 proteins identified in a reference mouse brain
proteome) [8]. In summary, the global microglial prote-
ome from adult mice shows that the large majority of
microglial proteins are ubiquitously expressed house-
keeping
proteins
although
highly
abundant
and
microglia-specific proteins also exist. The observed en-
richment of glycolytic, proteasome degradation, mito-
chondrial oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid beta
oxidation pathways suggest that adult microglia repre-
sent a highly metabolically active and dynamic group of
glial cells, rather than bystander resting cells as they
were once perceived to be.

Fig. 2 A high-level summary, gene ontology and pathway analysis of 4133 microglial proteins identified by TMT. a Histogram representing the
distribution of microglial proteins sorted by protein wet weight (bins with proteins contributing the most wet weight are on the left). Individual
protein wet weight contributions were estimated using the Perseus Proteomic Ruler analysis plugin [66], which uses measurements of histone
abundance to normalize reporter abundances assuming a total wet weight density of 200 mg/ml. The cumulative distribution of protein
abundance was highly dependent on a minority of proteins (of 4133 total) such that a majority of cumulative protein mass was accounted for by
a small number of proteins, i.e., 5.1% of all proteins accounted for 50% of cumulative protein mass. b Comparison of relative abundance
(abundance percentile rank) of proteins identified in our dataset with a reference mouse microglial proteome [8]. Abundance values of proteins
identified in WT mouse microglia were binned into quartiles and compared with the reference proteome. The proportions (%) of microglial
proteins are shown in each box. c Scatter plot representation of the most abundant proteins identified in our microglial proteome and the
reference microglial proteome. Proteins that were among the top 10th percentile of abundance in both datasets are highlighted in red. d Results

demonstrated significant differential expression (FDR <
0.05) across the three groups. Of these, 23 proteins
were differentially expressed comparing 5xFAD to WT
microglia (6 up-regulated and 17 down-regulated) and
the 6 proteins with increased expression in 5xFAD
microglia included App, Apoe, Clu, Htra1, Rab2b and
Necab1. GO analysis of differentially expressed proteins
showed that extracellular proteins, carbohydrate bind-
ing, post-transcriptional regulation, GTP binding and
regulation of phosphorylation were specifically enriched
in proteins increased in 5xFAD microglia while extra-
cellular proteins, anatomic structure development, ion
channel activity, transmembrane transport inhibition of
cell proliferation, locomotion and learning and memory
were enriched GO terms in proteins decreased in
5xFAD microglia (Fig. 3b, Additional file 4: Table S3).
Pathway analyses of differentially expressed proteins
identified aberrant lipid trafficking, altered lipid metab-
olism and ATP metabolism as being enriched among
proteins with increased expression in 5xFAD microglia
while anti-inflammatory IL4 signaling was enriched in
proteins with decreased expression in 5xFAD microglia
(Additional file 5: Table S4). Transcriptional factors
predicted to be upstream regulators of proteins overex-
pressed in 5xFAD microglia included PUR2α, AP-2 and
p53 while Dec1 (Stra13) and c-Myc were predicted as
upstream regulators of proteins decreased in 5xFAD
microglia (Additional file 4: Table S3).
In addition to identifying neurodegeneration-associated
microglial proteomic changes, we used the systemic
LPS-induced neuroinflammation model to compare acute
neuroinflammatory changes with chronic neuroinflamma-
tion seen in more indolent neurodegeneration models [12,
13]. In microglia from LPS-treated WT mice, 363 proteins
were ≥1.25-fold upregulated and 823 were ≥1.25-fold
down-regulated (Fig. 3c). Proteins increased following LPS
treatment were enriched for GO terms including cellular
responses
to
stress/cytokines,
mitochondrial
localization, increased cell proliferation and ribosomal
processes (Fig. 3c, Additional file 4: Table S3). Con-
versely, proteins decreased by LPS treatment were
enriched for GO terms including oxidoreductase activ-
ity, cell adhesion and cell contact, carboxylic acid me-
tabolism and ATP metabolism, suggesting a general
suppression of oxidative phosphorylation and motility
(Fig. 3d, Additional file 2: Table S2). We identified sev-
eral pro-inflammatory LPS-upregulated microglial pro-
teins that were increased in 5xFAD microglia (top 5:
Clu,
Nudt2,
Glipr2,
Diablo
and
Cstf2),
and

LPS-downregulated proteins that were decreased in
5xFAD microglia (top 5: Bcorl1, Plekhg1, Rasgef1a,

rections
of

in
microglia
derived
from
LPS-treated WT mice (Fig. 4a, R = 0.47 p < 0.001) sug-
gesting that
AD pathology, in general,
induces a
pro-inflammatory state in microglia. However, differ-
ences between LPS-activated microglia and 5xFAD
microglia were also observed. Several proteins were dif-
ferentially expressed in only in 5xFAD mouse microglia
without any LPS-induced changes, including increased
levels of App (Aβ peptide), Nop56, Ptn, Tmem151b and
Mgrn1 and decreased levels of Hist2h2be, Sar1a, Ttc9a
and Aimp3 (Fig. 4c), suggesting that these proteins may
be uniquely relevant to AD pathology. A comparison of
GO enrichment terms from each analysis (5xFAD vs
WT and LPS-WT vs WT, Fig. 3) reveals that while both
LPS and AD pathology resulted in a general inhibition
of microglial motility/locomotion, LPS-treatment in-

bolic processes while AD pathology inhibited cell

apoptosis, highlighting key metabolic and functional
differences between these two states of microglial acti-
vation despite anatomical/structural similarities.
To compare the proteomic profile of microglia from
acute
neuroinflammation
and
neurodegeneration
models with that of advanced aging, we contrasted
our findings with an existing microglia proteomic
study that compared young (3–5 mo) and very old
mice (20–24 mo) [10]. Of 267 aging-associated micro-
glial proteins identified in this reference dataset, 198
were identified in our microglial proteome of which
62 were differentially expressed either in 5xFAD or
LPS-treated WT mouse microglia. These 62 proteins
could be broadly classified into 4 clusters based on
direction of change in protein expression in aged and
LPS-treated mice (Fig. 4d). Only 8 proteins with al-
tered expression in 5xFAD microglia also showed
aging-related changes. Of the proteins increased in
5xFAD microglia, Hexb, Apoe and Cotl1 increased
with aging while Cstf2 and Set decreased with aging.
Interestingly, all three proteins that increased in aged WT
and 5xFAD mouse microglia are highly expressed by
microglia in the CNS [29], highlighting the microglial spe-
cificity of these AD- and aging-related protein alterations.
In summary, this comparative microglial proteomic ana-
lysis from models of acute neuroinflammation, aging and
AD pathology demonstrate model-specific as well as over-
lapping inflammatory changes in microglia.

Assessment of concordance between transcriptomic and
proteomic changes in microglia in acute
neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disease states
To assess the degree of concordance between transcrip-
tomic and proteomic changes in microglia, we contrasted
our proteomic findings in WT, LPS-induced neuroinflam-
mation and 5xFAD models with existing RNAseq or
microarray data from CD11b+ microglia acutely isolated
from similar model systems [5, 25]. Of the common gene
symbols in existing RNAseq and our proteomic dataset
from LPS-treated WT mouse microglia, we identified 72
genes/proteins were differentially expressed in both data-
sets of which only 35 (48.6%) showed concordant changes
(11 up-regulated, 24 down-regulated, Fig. 5a). Similarly,
we contrasted our proteomics findings to existing tran-
scriptomic data obtained from CD11b+ microglia from
WT and 5xFAD mice [24], in which 3200 genes were
found to be differentially expressed. Our proteomic data-
set comparing 5xFAD to WT microglia included 902 of
the 3200 genes which were altered at the transcript level.
Among the 187 differentially expressed proteins (Fig. 5b),
43 were also altered at the transcriptomic level. Of these
43, only 22 (51.2%) showed concordant changes (8
up-regulated, 14 down-regulated). Among gene symbols
identified in both proteomics and transcriptomics data-
sets, we also identified expression changes in 5xFAD mice
that occurred exclusively at the protein or transcript levels
(Fig. 5c). Proteins upregulated in 5xFAD microglia that
did not demonstrate changes at the transcript level in-
cluded Nop56, Pnoc, Ikbkg, Nudt2, Glipr2, Diablo and
Htra1. Conversely, genes upregulated in 5xFAD microglia
without proteome-level changes included Fabp3, Fabp5,
Myo1e, Myo5a, Atp1a3, Lmnb1 and Clic4. Overall, these
results
highlight
the
modest
levels
of
concordance
between expression changes at the transcriptome and
proteome levels and emphasize the need to perform mo-
lecular profiling at both transcript and protein levels since
each can provide unique and novel biological insights into
neurodegenerative disease processes.
Identification of microglial proteomic changes in AD
mouse models that are relevant to human AD
Since amyloid β accumulation seen in 5xFAD mice only
represents one of the pathological hallmarks of human
AD, we do not expect all protein changes in mouse
5xFAD microglia to be relevant to human disease [26].
To identify proteomic changes observed in mouse
5xFAD microglia that are consistent with human AD,
we compared our mouse microglial proteome with an
existing human post-mortem brain proteome in which
frontal
cortex
from
non-disease
controls
and
pathology-confirmed AD cases were compared [14].
Three thousand six hundred forty-four proteins identi-
fied in our microglial proteome were also identified in
this reference human brain proteome. While the overall
correlation between relative protein expression data be-
tween mouse microglia and human brain samples for all
identified proteins was low (R2 = 0.002), moderate cor-
relation (R2 = 0.34) was observed for 55 proteins that
were differentially expressed in both datasets. Of these
55 proteins, 11 (including App, Apoe, Htra1, Cotl1 and
Clu) were concordantly increased while 23 (including
Vgf, Rtn4, Alpl, Scn3a and Camk4) were concordantly
decreased in both 5xFAD microglia and human AD
brain (Fig. 6a).
Since App was identified as the most highly differen-
tially expressed and human AD-relevant protein in
5xFAD microglia, we further investigated individual App
peptide-level expression to determine whether this find-
ing was driven by de-novo App synthesis or Aβ phago-
cytosis by microglia. Five unique App peptides were
identified in the dataset (Fig. 6b) of which 2 mapped to
the Aβ sequence, 2 mapped to the C-terminal YNPTY
endocytosis motif and 1 mapped to N-term residues
439–450. Since all five App peptides were identical in
mice and humans, we were unable to directly confirm
the source (mouse or human) of the App peptides
identified in microglia. Selective increased expression of
both Aβ42 peptides was noted in 5xFAD microglia while
the C-term peptide and the N-term sequences showed
no group-wise differences. This pattern of App pep-
tide
differential
expression
strongly
suggests
that
intra-microglial Aβ is phagocytosed and not produced
within microglia.
Validation of microglial Apoe and Cotl1 protein
expression in AD
Among the top 5 proteins (Fig. 6a) with increased
expression in 5xFAD microglia and post-mortem human
AD brain, Apoe and Cotl1 were also highly expressed at
the transcriptional level by microglia [8, 29]. Therefore,
we performed additional neuropathological studies to
characterize Cotl1 and Apoe protein expression in AD.
Cotl1 or coactosin like F-actin binding protein 1 is an
actin-binding protein that promotes the activity of
5-lipoxygenase, as enzyme that converts arachidonic acid
into leukotriene A4 [30]. Cotl1 is also expressed by im-
mune cells including macrophages and has been recently
reported to regulate actin dynamics at the immune
synapse in addition to promoting the function of lipoxy-
genase 5 (5LOX), an enzyme that converts arachidonic
acid to leukotriene A4 (LTA4) [31]. Cotl1 is highly and
specifically expressed by microglia at the transcript and
protein levels (Fig. 7a) [8, 29], consistent with our find-
ing that Cotl1 is a highly abundant microglial protein. In
an analysis of an existing proteomic dataset comparing
frontal cortical regions from AD, Parkinson’s disease and
non-disease post-mortem brain tissues [18], we found
Rangaraju et al. Molecular Neurodegeneration  (2018) 13:34 
Page 11 of 19
that Cotl1 protein expression was increased in AD cases
(Fig. 7b). Cotl1 protein expression was also strongly cor-
related with neurofibrillary tangle pathology (Braak
stage) (Fig. 7c) and belonged to a glial co-expression
protein module that was positively associated with AD
pathology (Fig. 7d) [32, 33]. In addition to Cotl1, this
glial module also contained other proteins that are per-
tinent to eicosanoid biosynthesis such as LTA4 hydrolase
(Lta4H) which catalyzes the conversion of LTA4 to LTB4
[34] and, prostaglandin D2 synthase (Ptgds) which

catalyzes the conversion of prostaglandin H2 (PG-H2) to
PG-D2 [35]. In immuno-histochemical studies of human
post-mortem brains, we found that Cotl1 was specifically
expressed by CD68+ microglia (Fig. 7e) but not by
GFAP+ astrocytes (Fig. 7f). In a comparative immuno-
histochemistry analysis of AD and non-AD post-mortem
frontal
cortex
tissues,
we
found
that
cortical
and
sub-cortical white matter microglia showed significantly
higher Cotl1 protein expression as compared to non-AD
controls (Fig. 7g). We also observed that microglia
highly expressing Cotl1 in the AD brain had an activated
morphology with larger cell bodies and numerous pro-
cesses (Fig. 7g).
The second protein we validated was Apoe (apolipo-
protein E) which regulates cholesterol and Aβ transport
into the brain and is strongly implicated in AD patho-
genesis [36]. Carriers of the Apoε4 allele have signifi-
cantly higher risk of developing late-onset AD and in
mouse models of AD pathology, Apoε4 promotes neu-
roinflammatory responses leading to neurodegeneration,
independent of its effects of Aβ processing [6, 36, 37].
Apoe is highly expressed in astrocytes and microglia at
both transcriptomic and proteomic levels (Fig. 8a) and is
a specific marker of disease-associated-microglia that are
highly prevalent in neurodegenerative diseases [5, 8, 29].
We observed that Apoe protein expression in mouse
5xFAD brains closely resembled immunostaining of Aβ
plaques (Fig. 8b) which was not affected by preincuba-
tion with Aβ fibrils (Additional file 3: Figure S2). Apoe
also
partly
co-localized
with
Iba1
immuno-reactive
microglia
(Fig.
8b)
confirming
the
presence
of
intra-microglial Apoe protein. Although Apoe and Aβ
(4G8) showed overlapping plaque-like immunostaining
patterns with high degree of co-localization, Apoe within
microglia also co-localized with Aβ, suggesting shared
intracellular compartmentalization, presumably within
phagosomes (Fig. 8c and d). These data suggest that
Apoe within microglia could represent either phagocytic
co-uptake of Apoe along with Aβ, or may represent
functional interaction between microglial Apoe in the
phagocytic uptake of extra-cellular Aβ and shared subse-
quent subcellular compartmentalization in microglia.
These results show that Cotl1 is specific microglial pro-
tein that is selectively increased in AD while Apoe, at
least at the protein level, may be involved in phagocytic
uptake of Aβ in plaque-associated microglia.
Discussion
Advances in deep RNA sequencing and proteomic
methods have provided unprecedented opportunities to
characterize the molecular and cellular complexity of the
CNS [5, 8, 9, 25, 32, 38, 39]. Microglia are the principal
immune effectors in the CNS [1] that perform homeo-
static functions under normal conditions but adopt

post-transcriptional events that further regulate protein
expression and degradation, leading to modest levels of
agreement between transcript and protein expression
data [7, 8, 32]. Primary microglial proteomes from

been published [11]. However, proteomic profiling of
microglia from neuroinflammation models and later
time points in neurodegenerative disease models has not
been reported, representing a significant gap in the field.
We present a comprehensive proteome of acutely iso-
lated CD11b+ microglia from older adult mice (6–7 mo
og age) under normal, acute neuroinflammatory and
chronic neurodegenerative disease conditions and high-
light differentially expressed proteins specific to each
state with relevance to human AD.
By contrasting microglia-specific changes in 5xFAD
mice to existing human brain proteomes, we have found
that App, Apoe, Clu, Htra1 and Cotl1 were among the
most highly upregulated proteins in microglia isolated
from a mouse model of AD pathology. Of these, App,
Apoe, Clu and Htra1 have known AD-relevant biology
although their expression and role within microglia in
AD is not clear [36, 40, 41]. Increased expression of
Apoe, Htra1 and Clu proteins, but not of Cotl1, has
been reported in 5xFAD microglia as early as 10 weeks
of age when Aβ deposition is first seen [11]. Addition-
ally, we identified Cotl1 as a microglia-specific marker
with increased expression in human AD. Cotl1 was also
found in a recent network analysis study of post-mortem
human AD brains to be a key member of a glial module
that is positively correlated with AD pathology [32]. In
this module, Cotl1 was co-expressed with leukotriene
A4 hydrolase (Lt4ah). Since Cotl1 stabilizes and pro-
motes the activity of lipoxygenase 5 (5-LOX) to convert
arachidonic acid to LT-A4 [30, 31], a co-upregulation of
Lt4ah in AD microglia is predicted to facilitate LT-A4
conversion to LT-B4, a pro-inflammatory leukotriene
implicated in neurotoxicity and Aβ formation [42–44].
Another protein co-expressed with Cotl1 was PG-D2
synthase (Ptgds), an enzyme that catalyzes the conver-
sion of PG-H2 to PG-D2 in the cyclooxygenase pathway
of
arachidonic
acid
metabolism
[45].

as specific inhibition of PG-D2 signaling results in neu-
roprotection in animal models [46, 47]. These conver-
ging lines of evidence suggest that at least some
pro-inflammatory effects of microglia in AD may be me-
diated by LTB4 and PG-D2 [45]. Since Cotl1 is involved
in actin dynamics, immune synapse function and regula-
tion of eicosanoid biosynthesis, we suspect that Cotl1
may regulate motility and neuroinflammatory functions
mediated by microglia in AD [30, 31, 45].
Apoe expression, like Cotl1, was also highly increased
in 5xFAD microglia. This is consistent with observations
from transcriptomic studies of microglia where Apoe was
upregulated in neurodegenerative disease models and was
identified as a marker of disease-associated-microglia [5,
6, 20]. Our immuno-histochemical studies show that
Apoe protein, unlike Cotl1, is not expressed by ramified/
homeostatic microglia, but is seen within microglial pro-
cesses that surround and infiltrate Aβ plaques in 5xFAD
mice, and specifically co-localizes with intra-microglial
Aβ. Since activated microglia engulf Aβ and Apoe strongly
co-localizes with Aβ within microglia, our findings suggest
that microglia may either phagocytose Aβ and Apoe that
co-aggregate
in
the
AD
brain
or
that
Apoe’s
co-localization with Aβ indicates functional interaction
between Aβ and Apoe during Aβ phagocytosis and clear-
ance [48, 49]. In support of the latter possibility are recent
findings demonstrating the role of Apoe, along with
Trem2, in the transition of microglia from homeostatic to
DAM states in AD [27, 29], as well as the consistent iden-
tification of Apoe within microglia in our as well as other
microglia proteomes [8, 10, 11].
In addition to validating specific proteins with in-
creased expression in 5xFAD microglia, our bioinformat-
ics
analyses
provide
clues
regarding
the
general
metabolic and inflammatory states of microglia in AD.
We observed that dysfunctional lipid metabolism and
trafficking seem to be features of microglia in AD brain.
Since dysfunction in lipid metabolism and clearance are
implicated in AD pathogenesis [50, 51], comprehensive
lipidomic characterization of microglia from AD models
may provide novel insights into mechanisms of impaired
lipid clearance in AD. Our observation of general sup-
pression of IL4-related pathways in 5xFAD microglia
along
with
similarities
between
protein
expression
profiles of microglia in 5xFAD mice and LPS-induced
neuroinflammatory states suggest that microglia in AD
adopt
a
profile
more
consistent
with
that
of
pro-inflammatory microglia. However, the identification
of p53 and AP2 as upstream transcriptional regulators of
AD-associated microglial activation are distinct from
regulators of canonical LPS-induced pro-inflammatory
activation such [52–54] suggesting that unique inflam-
matory activation pathways are also upregulated by
microglia in AD models. Beyond changes in AD models,
our results from LPS-treated WT mice also demonstrate
robust effects of systemic inflammation on energy me-
tabolism and oxidative stress in microglia. GO analyses
showed that LPS-induced systemic inflammation sup-
pressed
mitochondrial
oxidative
phosphorylation
in
microglia. In LPS-treated mouse microglia, 21 mito-
chondrial proteins were reduced while cellular stress re-
sponse
proteins
were
upregulated,
suggesting
that
stress-induced mitochondrial damage may occur in
microglia in response to systemic inflammation. Further-
more, LPS upregulated proteins involved in focal adhe-
sion formation, proliferation, exocytosis and apoptosis
confirming a state of microglial activation [13]. Since
systemic LPS does not cross the blood brain barrier [55],
our observations are more likely to represent indirect ef-
fects of LPS (involving Tnf or other soluble factors) ra-
ther than direct toll-like-receptor-mediated effects of
LPS on microglia [56].
Our study also identified several highly abundant and
microglia-specific proteins including Bin1, Msn, Cotl1
and Hexb [3]. The identification of Bin1 as a highly
abundant protein in our microglial proteome agrees with
a reference mouse microglial proteome [8] and is of par-
ticular relevance in AD [57]. At the transcript level, Bin1
is highly and specifically expressed by homeostatic
microglia and Bin1 down-regulation occurs as microglia
adopt DAM profiles in neurodegenerative disease [5,
25]. Although Bin1 polymorphisms have been identified
as independent risk factors for late-onset AD [57], the
pathophysiological roles of Bin1 in AD are unclear.
Based on our findings that are consistent with existing
expression data for Bin1 in the brain [8, 25], it may be
particularly important to further investigate the role of
Bin1 in microglia-mediated neuroinflammatory mecha-
nisms in neurodegenerative disorders. We also identified
Hexosaminidase
B
(HexB)
as
abundant
microglial
protein
that
was
also
previously
shown
to
be
microglia-specific at transcriptomic and proteomic levels
[3, 5, 8, 25]. We observed that HexB was upregulated by
5xFAD microglia. Hexb is an endosomal-lsysomal en-
zyme that regulates ganglioside metabolism and is
involved in autophagy [58]. Hexb mutation results in a
rare lysosomal storage disorder called Type II GM2
gangliosidosis or Sandhoff disease that is characterized
by progressive hearing loss, seizures, intellectual disabilities
and motor deficits [59]. In the Hexb knock-out mouse,
accumulation intra-neuronal Aβ-like and synuclein-like
protein aggregates [58]. Our findings of Hexb upregulation
in microglia from AD mouse models further support the
possibility that dysregulation of lipid metabolism, lyso-
somal functions and autophagy in microglia may contrib-
ute to AD neuropathology [60–62].
Despite the identification of microglia-specific proteins
discussed above, some of the more well-known microglial
Rangaraju et al. Molecular Neurodegeneration  (2018) 13:34 
Page 16 of 19
proteins such as Tmem119 and P2ry12 were not identified
in our study [63, 64]. It is also interesting to note that the
reference
microglial
proteome
[8]
did
not
identify
Tmem119 in microglia even though Tmem119 protein ex-
pression
by
microglial
has
been
confirmed
by
immuno-histochemical methods [25, 64]. This may be ex-
plained by our use of whole cell lysates, rather than
membrane-enriched fractions for our study, leading to a
lower likelihood of identifying cell membrane anchored
proteins. This bias in our dataset is further supported by
the lack of enrichment of GO terms such as “cell mem-
brane” in our analyses. Another possibility for the relative
absence of membrane proteins in our study is potential loss
of cell membrane fragments during the cell isolation
process, a likely result of heavy myelination and architec-
tural complexity of the aging mouse brain as contrasted
with post-natal or younger adult mice. Since membrane re-
ceptors, ion channels and transporters may represent drug
targets for neurodegeneration, future studies using more
advanced proteomics technologies with deeper coverage
coupled with enrichment of membrane-associated micro-
glial proteins will likely help overcome this limitation.
Additional limitations of this study also deserve discus-
sion. In addition to ubiquitous and microglia-specific pro-
teins, several proteins highly expressed by astrocytes,
oligodendrocytes and neurons were also identified in our
microglial proteome despite > 95% enrichment of CD11b+
cells in our samples. While this could indicate cell or pro-
tein contamination by adherent non-microglial cell frag-
ments during CD11b+ enrichment, this could also be
indicative of constant pruning of neuronal synapses or
dendrites as well as phagocytic uptake of cellular debris,
myelin and astrocytic processes by microglia. Indeed, an
age dependent increase in myelin basic protein (Mbp)
peptides in mouse microglia has been previously reported
[65], which is more likely to explain why Mbp was highly
abundant in our dataset (top 10 percentile). As compared
to the reference proteome in which over 7000 proteins
were identified across 4 cell types by label-free quantitative
methods [8], we identified 4133 proteins by TMT. This
lower number of proteins identified could be attributed to
lower microglial yield from the older mouse brain as com-
pared to younger mice. Thus, pooling additional brain
samples as well as enzymatic digestion prior to microglial
isolation may be considered in future studies to improve
protein yield. A more likely explanation for lower number
of proteins identified is that our single batch of fraction-
ated TMT, 10-plex-quantified by SPS-MS3 mass spec-
trometry did not contain non-microglial enriched samples
from which to borrow or trigger identification and quanti-
fication of shared proteins which may be higher expressed
in other cell types (i.e., neurons, oligodendrocytes and as-
trocytes). Lastly, our analyses using 3 pools per group
were statistically underpowered to detect statistically
significant changes using FDR corrections for pair-wise
comparisons because of which we considered unadjusted
p-values < 0.05 as statistically significant. To overcome this
inherent limitation, we applied an additional fold-change
threshold of 25% which exceeded the overall coefficient of
variation for all protein measurements (6–7%) in each of
the three groups.
Conclusions
In conclusion, this deep and comprehensive proteomic
study of purified adult mouse microglia has allowed us
to identify shared and unique microglial proteomic
changes in acute neuroinflammatory, aging and AD
mouse models in addition to identifying novel roles for
microglial proteins in human neurodegeneration. In
addition to serving as a valuable resource to the neuro-
science research community, our study emphasizes the
value of applying state-of-the-art proteomics methods as
a complimentary approach to transcriptomics, to pro-
vide novel molecular insights in neurodegeneration.
