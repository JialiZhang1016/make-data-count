Seasonally dependent relationship between insect herbivores and
host plant density in Jatropha nana, a tropical perennial herb
Ashish N. Nerlekar
ABSTRACT
The fact that plant spatial aggregation patterns shape insect-
herbivore communities in a variety of ways has resulted in a large
body
of
literature
on
the
subject.
The
landmark
resource
concentration hypothesis predicts that density of insect herbivores
per plant will increase as host plant density increases. I examined this
prediction across temporal samplings using Jatropha nana and the
associated specialist insect herbivores as a system. Through 12 field
samplings, I modelled the effect of host plant density on insect-
herbivore loads. The initial samplings (2–3) provided evidence for the
resource concentration hypothesis, with insect loads increasing with
increasing host plant density, whereas the later samplings (4–5,
7–11) showed the opposite; a resource dilution pattern with a decline
of insect loads with increasing host plant density. These patterns also
depend on the biology of the herbivores and have important
implications on J. nana population dynamics.

INTRODUCTION
Insect herbivory is one of the most important biotic drivers that
maintains the structure and function of tropical plant communities
(Weissflog et al., 2018). Herbivory shapes plant community diversity,
species distributions, and phenology in a variety of ways, for example
through conspecific negative density dependence and altered
leaf flushing patterns (Janzen, 1970; Connell, 1971; Aide, 1992).
Conversely, host plant characteristics also play an important role in
driving patterns of insect-herbivore abundance and diversity,
through a variety of mechanisms including chemical and physical
defences, nutritional content of leaves, as well as spatial and
temporal variation in resources (Neves et al., 2014). Host plants
and insect herbivores have been widely studied given the
ecological importance of their relationships in understanding
trophic interactions (Koricheva et al., 2000) and the economic
importance of their relationships in crop production (Bukovinszky
et al., 2005).
Out of the several hypotheses that seek to explain the relation
between host plant heterogeneity, spatial complexity and insect-
herbivore characteristics, three key hypotheses are the ‘enemies
hypothesis’, the ‘resource concentration hypothesis’, and the
‘resource dilution hypothesis’ (Elton, 1958; Root, 1973; Otway
et al., 2005; Björkman et al., 2010). The ‘enemies hypothesis’
predicts that because of higher predator and parasite efficiency
in diverse environments, insect herbivores are less abundant in
species-diverse plant communities than in simple (e.g. monoculture)
communities (Elton, 1958). The ‘resource concentration hypothesis’
(RCH) goes further to consider host patch size and plant density as
predictors of herbivore abundance, along with plant diversity (Root,
1973). Specifically, the RCH predicts that as the density of host plants
or patch size increases, the density of specialist insect herbivores per
plant will also increase because of the lower emigration rates from
larger host patches, as these insects are more likely to find and stay in
larger host patches than smaller ones. This landmark hypothesis
initiated empirical testing on several systems across the world,
with equivocal results (Rhainds and English-Loeb, 2003). A major
development was made in this domain when Hambäck and
Englund (2005), through their ‘movement based hypothesis’, provided
theoretical models that could explain a much wider spectrum of
patterns based on the local growth rates and migration of the insects.
Through their models, they stressed that RCH is just one special case of
the several possible relationships between host density and herbivore
load on plants. Related to, but contrasting with the RCH, the ‘resource
dilution hypothesis’ (RDH) predicts that insect-herbivore loads on
host plants will instead decrease as host abundance increases
(Otway et al., 2005). Resource dilution may thus reduce herbivore
loads mathematically, through increased plant density and patch
size relative to insect population size (Otway et al., 2005).
Along with theories investigating plant spatial structure and
heterogeneity, the tremendous variation in plant investment in
defences against herbivores led to the formulation of two key
hypotheses: the ‘apparency theory’ and the ‘resource availability
hypothesis’ (Endara and Coley, 2011). The ‘apparency theory’ of
Feeny (1976) predicts that apparent perennial species, which
are common and easily found by both generalist and specialist
herbivores, will invest in high concentrations of chemical defences
that reduce plant palatability (Feeny, 1976). On the other hand, annual
unapparent species, which are difficult for herbivores to locate, invest
in small quantities of highly toxic chemicals that offer protection
against generalist herbivores (Feeny, 1976). The ‘resource availability
hypothesis’ by Coley (1987) further predicts that slow growing
species (often found in environments that constrain plant growth) are
better defended compared to fast growing plants in highly productive
environments. Essentially, for slow growing plants the cost of
herbivory is very high, which incentivizes investment in herbivore
defence. In contrast, fast growing plants with short-lived leaves can
quickly replace lost tissue at less cost than energetically expensive
defences (Coley, 1987).

Jatropha nana (Euphorbiaceae) is an endemic threatened perennial
herb (referred to in literature as a dwarf under-shrub) found in
fragmented populations in the states of Maharashtra, West-Bengal,
Jharkhand and Bihar in India (Nerlekar et al., 2016). This species
grows in distinct spatial aggregations in its natural habitat, which
provide a good range of host-plant density. J. nana is a perennial
geophyte and its shoots sprout from the tuberous rhizome in May, just
before the Indian monsoon season. The aboveground tissue then wilts
away by September and it remains dormant for the rest of the year
through the underground rhizome, making it functionally equivalent
to a herbaceous woody perennial (Nerlekar, 2015). Thus, it can be
classified as an ‘unapparent’ and ‘fast growing’ species (Feeny, 1976;
Coley, 1987) and we can predict that it is difficult for insects to develop
a specialism for the plant, and that it also has poor defences against
herbivores. However, contradictory to this prediction, Euphorbiaceae
members in the genus Jatropha attract only a selective set of insect
herbivores, owing to the secondary metabolites produced by the plants
that are toxic to most insects (Shanker and Dhyani, 2006). Since the
RCH is based primarily on specialist insect herbivores, I ascertained
the feeding preferences of major herbivores on J. nana through the
literature (Shanker and Dhyani, 2006; Kulkarni et al., 2009; Robinson
et al., 2010) as well as pilot observations in 2014 that confirmed that
this plant supported specialist insect herbivores in the study area,
further making it a suitable system to test this hypothesis.
In spite of the vast body of literature available on insect herbivores
and host-plant density, there are some gaps in our understanding. Most
studies testing the predictions of RCH have experimented with
cultivated plants and their pests as the focal species (Rhainds and
English-Loeb, 2003; Tooker and Frank, 2012). Hence, our knowledge
of plant–insect-herbivore relationships in wild systems is very limited
in general regarding the tropics (but see Hambäck et al., 2000; Otway
et al., 2005) and specifically for India (but see Thorat et al., 2016).
Furthermore, the plant–insect-herbivore relationship may vary across
seasons and time (Reznik, 1993), implying the need to test RCH across
seasons or for the complete life span of the focal plant. In light of these
gaps in our knowledge, in the present work I aimed to empirically
examine the effect of the density of a tropical shrub J. nana on the
insect-herbivore’s load in its natural habitat. For this, I used a wild host
plant (J. nana) and the associated insect herbivores as a study system
and employed a temporal field sampling approach to test the
predictions of the RCH at different stages of the host plant’s life cycle.
RESULTS
Insect-herbivore community
Through the current sampling, I recorded a total of 17 insect-
herbivore taxa (Table 1), of which five were Lepidopterans, six were
Hemipterans and two were Coleopterans. I omitted four out of these
17 insects from the analysis since they were singletons. The insect
community recorded showed an exceptionally high dominance of
the moth Pempelia cf. morosalis (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) (95.24%
relative abundance).
Temporal patterns of host plant density and herbivore
abundance
During S1, the lowest median density of ramets (6.5±9.87 SD)
across n=36 clumps was recorded, and during S4–S8, the highest
median density (11.5±14.71–14.91 SD) was recorded. The median
density of ramets for all clumps increased from S1–S4 and remained
constant till S9, after which it declined from S9 through S12 (Fig. 1).
The median density of all the clumps was not significantly different
across the 12 samplings (Kruskal-Wallis test, H=13.55, P>0.05).
The median total abundance of insect herbivores for all clumps
ranged from 0 (±11.66–75.31 SD) for S1–S4 and S12, to 9.5
(±73.29 SD) for S9 and was significantly different across samplings
(Kruskal-Wallis test, H=81.26, P<0.001). Similarly, median total
insect load for all clumps varied from 0 (±1.21–8.50 SD) for S1–S4,
rising up to the highest of 0.630 (±7.98 SD) for S9 and then
declining back to 0 (±0.44 SD) till S12 (Fig. 2). The median insect
load for all the clumps together was significantly different across
samplings (Kruskal-Wallis test, H=85.2, P<0.001). The pooled
insect load for a seasonal analysis (seasons delimited under ‘field
sampling’ section of the Materials and Methods section) revealed
that there was a significant difference in median insect loads across
seasons (Kruskal-Wallis test, H=63.02, P<0.001).
Relationship between host-plant density and insect loads
The generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) analysis for all the
samplings together revealed that plant density was a significant

predictor in a positive direction (t=8.0156; P<0.001) of insect loads
irrespective of the temporal samplings. However, for the individual
samplings overall, the results of the Poisson regression between
plant density and insect loads varied across samplings. For the
regressions of individual samplings, the estimates of the coefficient
ranged from −0.0504 (SE=0.0094) for S5 to 0.0734 (SE=0.0418)
for S12. A significant positive relationship was observed between
host plant density and insect load from S2 through S3, whereas a
significant negative relationship was observed from S4 through S5
and S7 through S11 (Table 2). The G statistic, which is the
difference between the deviance of the model and another GLMM
with only intercept fitted (Hammer et al., 2001), shows the highest
values for S5, S7, S9, indicating the highest difference from the null
(intercept) model for these samplings. Because there was a predicted
significant increase in insect load per unit of plant density, it can be
concluded that there was a resource concentration pattern observed
for S2 and S3. Similarly for each sampling, since the insect load
decreases significantly with per unit rise of host-plant density, a
resource dilution effect was observed for S4 through S11 (Fig. 3).
DISCUSSION
The present work thus provides only partial support for the RCH
and the results support the predictions of the RCH for the initial
stages of the host plant. They also provide evidence for the opposite
pattern of a resource dilution effect in the later stages. Samplings
S2–S3 showed a positive relationship between host-plant density
and insect-herbivore load. During this stage, the clumps have not
reached the full density of ramets and are at a relatively initial
phenology stage. A resource concentration pattern at these stages
might most probably be a result of the higher emigration rates from
smaller clumps and higher immigration rates into larger clumps
(Root, 1973). These migration rates are directly dependent on the
search mode of the insects (Bukovinszky et al., 2005) which is
largely olfaction (for moths) in the present work. Through their
simulated study for insects using olfaction as a search mode,
Bukovinszky et al. (2005) predicted that insect loads will increase in
patches of intermediate densities. The present results however show
a mixed pattern, where the samplings with the highest host-plant
density (S4–S5, S7–S8) show a resource dilution pattern, the ones

with the lowest density (S1, S12) do not show any significant
pattern, and the rest samplings (S2–S3 and S9–S11) with
intermediate densities show both patterns. Considering the fact
that insects can use a combination of search modes and that we
know much less about this, our inferences are limited in some cases
(Rhainds and English-Loeb, 2003). From S4 onwards, the insect
load showed an inverse relationship such that it decreases as the
host-plant density increases. Samplings S4–S10 represent the peak
monsoon season and the density of ramets has reached a peak during
this time. The mechanistic explanation provided by Otway et al.
(2005) for such a dilution effect focusses on the inability of
colonization and post colonization population growth to give rise to
resource concentration.
Just as host plant densities predict insect-herbivore abundance,
insect herbivory also affects the population dynamics of the host
plant in different ways. Depending upon the different insect
aggregation patterns, Stephens and Myers (2012) predict different
outcomes for host plant population dynamics. For a resource
concentration pattern, as seen for S2–S3 in this study, they predict a
decline of larger patches due to higher herbivore pressure and
growth of smaller patches. Similarly, for a resource dilution pattern,
as seen for S4–S5 and S7–S11 in this study, larger patches are
predicted to show growth and smaller ones to decline. Thus, both
these insect aggregation patterns have contrasting effects on the
plant population. The model by Stephens and Myers (2012) only
deals with insect loads and there exists a paucity of knowledge
regarding how parasites and parasitoides (on the insect herbivores)
in turn affect the host plant population dynamics for various insect
aggregation patterns. For the present system, given the higher
abundance of these parasitoides (Trissolcus jatrophae, Cheilomenes
sp., and Telenomus sp.) in the intermediate samplings (A.N.N,
unpublished, also see Nerlekar and Rajmohana, 2016), it would be
useful to model their impact on J. nana population dynamics.
Thus, further studies that investigate patch extinction dynamics and
parasitoid loads and link it with anthropogenic pressures will be a
useful extension of the present work. Understanding population
dynamics of J. nana is crucial since this species is threatened
globally, and has an IUCN Red list status of ‘vulnerable’ (Nerlekar
et al., 2016).
Both abiotic and biotic factors are known to shape plant
phenology patterns and within biotic factors, insect herbivory has
been reported to be an important selective force for phenology
shifts, especially in the tropics (Aide, 1988). Leaf flushing of trees
in the dry season has been proven to be a strategy to avoid peak
insect herbivory in tropical seasonal forests (Aide, 1988, 1992;
Murali and Sukumar, 1993). The phenology patterns of J. nana also
show such dry season leaf and flower production, which starts in
May (A.N.N, unpublished). The present data suggests that insect
load is relatively lower in the pre-monsoon samplings (S1–S3) than
the monsoon samplings (S4–S10). Given these phenology and
insect load patterns, it would be reasonable to extend this hypothesis
to this functionally woody perennial herb that also employs a dry
season leaf flushing strategy to avoid higher insect herbivory in the
wet season. However, higher insect load may or may not always
translate into higher herbivory pressure (Rhainds and English-Loeb,
2003) (as is the case with P. morosalis) and directly measuring
damage due to herbivory as a response across different phenology
stages might be helpful in fully testing this hypothesis.
One of the limitations of this study was that the observations were
only conducted for a specific time period during the day, which
might have resulted in the omission of nocturnal herbivores. The
RCH also hypothesises a relationship between host-patch diversity
and insect loads and this was not considered in the present study.
Distance between patches plays an important role in migration rates
(Coley, 1987) which could not be accounted for in this work, owing
to the restricted distribution of the species. Lastly, for insects I used
an observation based method instead of commonly used insect traps
which might have introduced bias.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study area
The hills in Pune city harbour the largest known population of J. nana in
India (Nerlekar et al., 2016). The present study was carried out in the Vetal
hills (18°31′31.04″N; 73°49′11.17″E), the Pashan-Baner hills (18°32′
56.22″N; 73°47′9.16″E) and the NDA hills (18°30′1.27″N; 73°46′50.25″E)
in Pune. These hills are an important natural landscape within an urban area
and the habitat is a mosaic of plantations of exotic species and patches of
remnant native savannah vegetation (Nerlekar and Kulkarni, 2015; https://
thewire.in/environment/open-savannahs-versus-wooded-thickets-whats-
the-future-for-punes-hills). On the Vetal and Pashan-Baner hills, the native
Anogeissus-Lannea-Boswellia tree community is commonly found along
with plantations of Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Kunth (Leguminosae) and
Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. (Leguminosae) (Nerlekar and
Kulkarni, 2015), whereas the NDA hills have fairly intact vegetation with
low anthropogenic disturbance (Vattakaven et al., 2016). The elevation of
the hills is about 700 m above sea level and the region receives annual
seasonal rainfall (about 700 mm), of which about 90% is received between
June and October. The average daily minimum temperature for January is
about 11.4°C, whereas the average daily maximum temperature for April is
38.1°C. During the sampling duration (May to September, 2015), the
maximum average daily temperature was recorded as 40.8°C on the 4th of
May, whereas the minimum average daily temperature was 18.0°C on the

3rd of September and the total average daily rainfall was 584 mm (data from
Indian Meteorological Department, Pune).
Standardization of focal sampling unit
The study species J. nana grows in spatial aggregations and the radii of such
aggregations vary. In order to delimit the clump radius, the degree of
clumping of ramets (a single above ground shoot) was taken into account by
the following formula: degree of clumping=density of all ramets in clump/
average distance of all ramets from assumed centre. I noted readings of the
degree of clumping for 16 such clumps for increasing radii at 1 m interval
from the centre. Then I plotted the degree of clumping versus area of circle.
The radius at which the value for degree of clumping flattens was found to
be 80 m2 area (=5 m radius) which was used as the radius for all clumps and
kept constant during all samplings (Fig. S1). Thus, the focal observation
area was kept constant, within which the individual ramets’ densities were
recorded.
Field sampling
Through pilot ground surveys in 2014, I traced and mapped clumps of
J. nana in the study area. I carried out field sampling 12 times [intervals
between sampling range from 5–8 days (average 6.6 days) for sampling 1
and sampling 11, and 16 days between sampling 11 and sampling 12 (see
Table S1 for sampling dates)] from May to September 2015 (referred to as
S1–S12 hereon). In each sampling effort I measured 36 stratified random
clumps, proportional to the total estimated population on each of the hills
(23 on Vetal hills, eight on NDA hills and five on Pashan hills) based on
varying initial densities. I divided a typical sampling into three to four days
(an average of four hours/day) and sampled within a fixed time range of
1300 h to 1700 h. In each sampling I noted the density of ramets and
presence of insect herbivores in each clump. The sampling period covers a
seasonal transition from late summer (S1–S2, May, hot and dry with
intermittent thunderstorms, most monsoon herbs in dormant stage, J. nana
ramets sprouting from tubers) to early monsoon (S3–S5, June, intermediate
rainfall, monsoon herbaceous vegetation in initial growth stages, J. nana
ramets flowering), mid monsoon (S6–S10, June–August, maximum rainfall,
peak flowering, fruiting for most monsoon herbaceous vegetation including
J. nana) and late monsoon (S11–S12, August–September, intermediate
rainfall with minimum mean minimum daily temperature, monsoon
herbaceous vegetation about to dry, most J. nana ramets wilted and fruits
fully mature) for the study area.
On all the ramets within the clump, I scanned insect herbivores visually
by turning at least 50 % of randomly selected leaves by hand to check the
underside, and recorded the insect species along with their abundance. For
Pempelia cf. morosalis caterpillars, I recorded the abundance as follows:
due to the webbing behaviour of the caterpillars, it was difficult to estimate
absolute abundance without employing invasive methods. Hence, I scored
the damage due to consumption as low, moderate or high. The low damage
stage had about 70 individuals, 40 individuals for moderate and ten
individuals for high, as found out by pilot observations (The low damage
stage has more individuals than the high damage stage). I ascertained an
insect as herbivore only if it was seen damaging any plant part in the field or
the lab, or if it was indicated in the literature. Thus, I omitted insects that
were currently at life stages that do not feed on plants (for example eggs,
pupae) from the analysis. I also excluded herbivores that occurred only once
in all the samplings combined (singletons) from the analyses. I collected
insect specimens, preserved in 70 % ethanol, which were identified using
standard keys (Hampson, 1892–1896; Distant, 1977) and validated by
experts. It was not possible to identify some insects at the species level due
to multiple factors including lack of adequate number of specimens, lack of
specimens at the adult stage (some moths were only recorded as larva and
could not be successfully reared in the lab for recording adult morphology)
and finally lack of revised and updated literature. In all such cases, I
identified the insects to the lowest taxonomic level possible.
Data analysis
All statistical analysis was performed in PAST (Hammer et al., 2001) and
STATISTICA (StatSoft, 2001). I checked data for normality by using the
Shapiro-Wilk’s test and found it to be non-normal, therefore I chose the
non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test to check if there was a significant
difference between sampling for density of ramets and insect loads. Insect
load has been defined as total abundance of all insects divided by the total
number of ramets in the clump (Otway et al., 2005). For all the tests, results
were considered significant at the α =0.05 threshold level. To check if the
insect-herbivore load was significantly predicted by plant density for all
samplings combined, I used GLMM with Poisson distribution and log link
function, keeping sampling numbers as a random factor. Similarly, to model
the impact of plant density on insect-herbivore loads for each sampling
separately, I compared model coefficients using a Poisson regression (with
clump numbers as a random factor) within the GLMM framework, with log
link owing to the Poisson distribution of data (Agresti, 2007).
Acknowledgements
I express my deepest gratitude towards H. V. Ghate for identification of the insects
and guidance. I thank Akshay Onkar and Shubham Mudrale who regularly
volunteered during the sampling. Inputs on project design provided by Vedant Dixit,
Prerna Agarwal, and on the manuscript by Joseph Veldman, Ovee Thorat, Vikram
Aditya, Srikanta Dani, Nikhil Modak, Harshad Mayekar greatly improved the quality
of this work. Peter Smetacek, Sachin Gurule, Mansi Mungee, Neha Mujumdar
