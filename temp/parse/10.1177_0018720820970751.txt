Objective: To investigate pedestrians‚Äô misuse of an automated 
vehicle (AV) equipped with an external human‚Äìmachine interface 
(eHMI). Misuse occurs when a pedestrian enters the road because 
of uncritically following the eHMI‚Äôs message.
Background: Human factors research indicates that automa-
tion misuse is a concern. However, there is no consensus regarding 
misuse of eHMIs.
Methods: Sixty participants each experienced 50 crossing trials 
in a Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) simulator. The 
three independent variables were as follows: (1) behavior of the ap-
proaching AV (within- subject: yielding at 33 or 43 m distance, no 
yielding), (2) eHMI presence (within- subject: eHMI on upon yielding, 
off), and (3) eHMI onset timing (between- subjects: eHMI turned on 
1 s before or 1 s after the vehicle started to decelerate). Two failure 
trials were included where the eHMI turned on, yet the AV did not 
yield. Dependent measures were the moment of entering the road 
and perceived risk, comprehension, and trust.
Results: Trust was higher with eHMI than without, and the 
‚àí1 Group crossed earlier than the +1 Group. In the failure trials, 
perceived risk increased to high levels, whereas trust and compre-
hension decreased. Thirty- Ô¨Åve percent of the participants in the ‚àí1 
and +1 Groups walked onto the road when the eHMI failed for the 
Ô¨Årst time, but there were no signiÔ¨Åcant differences between the two 
groups.
Conclusion: eHMIs that provide anticipatory information 
stimulate early crossing. eHMIs may cause people to over- rely on 
the eHMI and under- rely on the vehicle- intrinsic cues.
Application: eHMI have adverse consequences, and education 
of eHMI capability is required.

are due to human error (National Highway

Automated vehicles (AVs) have the poten-

pedestrians decide to cross the road in front of an 
approaching vehicle, they rely on both implicit 
and explicit cues. Implicit cues are regular vehi-
cle behaviors, such as speed and deceleration. 
Explicit cues, on the other hand, are not part of 
vehicle behavior, and include amongst others, 
eye contact, posture, and hand gestures of the 
driver (6XFKD HW DO ). One of the chal-
lenges in future AVs will be that the driver may 
be inattentive or even absent, which implies that 
explicit communication will become cumber-
some or impossible.

an eHMI could indicate the yielding intention

pedestrians, which could be employed in ambig-
uous situations, for example (Clamann et al., 
2017; Dey & Terken, 2017; Moore et al., 2019; 
Rodr√≠guez Palmeiro et al., 2018; Rothenbucher

form of eHMIs versus implicit communication 
in the form of the vehicle movement itself (e.g., 
Moore et al., 2019) is not yet well understood 
and the subject of some debate.
An evaluation of various eHMIs by L√∂cken 
et al. (2019) has shown that eHMIs that were 
deemed clear, supportive, and easy to use (i.e., 
high pragmatic quality) yielded the highest lev-
els of self- reported trust. A possible concern 
after prolonged exposure to reliable AVs and 
clear eHMIs is that pedestrians may start to trust 
and rely strongly on the eHMI, while ignoring 
implicit cues from the AV, that is, its actual 
yielding behavior. This, in turn, may cause mis-

performance increased as they became familiar 
with the system. However, after experiencing a 
fault, trust declined considerably. More recently,

an eHMI conveying incorrect information; that 
is, the AV stopped, but a ‚Äúhalt‚Äù symbol was pre-
sented, or the AV maintained speed while a green 
walking symbol was presented. Results showed 
that the incorrect information caused a sharp 
decline in perceived trust and safety. Perceived 
trust and safety recovered directly afterwards, 
indicating that the incorrect information had no

properly functioning eHMI.
Based on the above, it appears essential to 
assess the development of trust and possible mis-
use during repeated exposure to eHMIs. One fac-
tor that has not been studied so far concerns the 
interplay between explicit cues (i.e., the eHMI 
signal) and implicit cues (i.e., AV speed and dis-
tance). If pedestrians are relying predominantly 
on implicit cues, then eHMI misuse should be 
unlikely. Conversely, if participants rely strongly 
on the information provided by the eHMI while 
ignoring implicit cues, then there is a risk of mis-

trian crosses if the eHMI signals so, even when 
the AV does not yield for the pedestrian.
One critical variable in the examination 
of reliance on explicit communication versus 
implicit communication is the eHMI onset tim-
ing. de Clercq et al. (2019) showed that partici-
pants felt more inclined to cross when the eHMI 
(e.g., a text ‚ÄúWALK‚Äù or a front brake light) 
switched on before the AV started braking, 
compared with a condition without the eHMI. 
Although early onset timing stimulates pedes-
trians to cross early, it could also cause misuse 
if pedestrians do not line up the information 
provided by the eHMI with the AVs implicit 
cues (i.e., is the AV indeed slowing down?).

failed (i.e., eHMI turned on, but the AV did not

of ‚Äúfailure‚Äù if an AV stops for another pedes-
trian or object further down the road. We further 
expected that pedestrians would cross earlier 
when the eHMI provided information ‚Äúearly,‚Äù 
that is, when the eHMI onset occurred before 
the AV started braking. We compared this to 
an eHMI that provided ‚Äúlate‚Äù information, 
which means that the eHMI turned on after the 
AV started braking. Finally, we expected that 
pedestrians who have been repeatedly exposed 
to an early- onset eHMI would be more likely 
to initiate crossing when the eHMI failed, as 
compared with pedestrians who have repeatedly 
encountered a late- onset eHMI.
Previous research found that for an AV that 
aims to communicate ‚ÄúI am giving way,‚Äù a puls-

et al., 2019). It has further been recommended 
that, for better visibility, eHMIs need to be 
positioned on the front and the sides of the car 
instead of only on the front (Eisma et al., 2020). 
Our study featured an AV with a 360¬∞ pulsing 
light band located on the front and sides of the 
vehicle as well as on the grill. This positioning 
should enable the pedestrian to be aware of the 
light band from any direction. The experiment

This research complied with the American 
Psychological Association Code of Ethics 
and was approved by the University of 
Leeds Research Ethics Committee (Ref:

ten informed consent.
Pedestrian Simulator
The study was conducted in the Highly 
Immersive Kinematic Experimental Research 
(HIKER) pedestrian simulator (Figure 1) at the 
University of Leeds, which is a 9- m long by 4- m

wide CAVE- type simulator. Participants wore 
stereoscopic motion- tracking glasses and could 
move around freely. The virtual environment 
featured a single- lane, 4.19- m- wide road in a 
city environment during daytime (Figure 1). A 
fence was placed on the other side of the road, 
to prevent the participant from crossing beyond 
that point. The simulator was programmed to 
alert the participant with a warning sound when 
they were too close to the wall beyond the fence.
The experiment ran on a computer rack of 
eight machines, each one of them containing 
an Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i9- 7900X CPU @ 3.30 GHz 
processor, 128 GB RAM, and 8 GB Nvidia 
Quadro P4000. The scenario was generated 
in Unity 2017.4.17 with a Middle VR 1.7.1.2 
licensed plugin and ran in stereo mode at a res-
olution of 2560 √ó 1600 pixels per projector. Ten 
IR motion trackers connected to the software 
Vicon Tracker 3.7 tracked the position and head 
angle of the participant.
Experimental Design
The experiment had three independent vari-
ables: eHMI onset, yielding behavior of the AV, 
and eHMI presence.

Yielding behavior. Yielding behavior was 
a within- subject variable with three levels: (1) 
yielding while starting to decelerate at a 33 m 
distance, (2) yielding while starting to deceler-
ate at a 43 m, and (3) no yielding, as illustrated 
in Figure 2. The interactions with the eHMI 
occurred during yielding trials only. The non-
yielding trials were included to make partici-
pants aware that they could not cross the road 
in all trials but would be required to look at the 
AV before crossing. During nonyielding trials, 
the AV maintained a speed of 30 mph (~48 kph) 
without stopping. For the yielding trials, the AV 
decelerated at 2.24 m/s2 and 2.99 m/s2 for stop-
ping distances of 43 m and 33 m, respectively.

We used two stopping distances instead of one, 
to introduce variability and prevent participants 
from recognizing that the AV always behaved in 
the same way. During yielding trials, the vehicle 
came to a stop at a distance of 3 m from the 
participant and waited until the pedestrian had

vehicles having an eHMI to indicate when the 
vehicle is yielding.
In pilot tests, we noticed that our initial light 
band design, as proposed by Lee et al. (2019), 
was sometimes not noticed by participants. 
Because our aim was to evaluate possible mis-
use of the eHMI, we increased the brightness 
of the eHMI so that participants would not be 
likely to overlook it. Accordingly, we designed 
an eHMI consisting of a thick white light band 
around the top edges of the car and the front 
grill (Figure 4). The light band was pulsating

the light band was on, its intensity varied in a 
zigzag- like manner between 30% and 100%, 
with an intensity peak- to- peak interval of 0.80 
s. That is, the intensity was 100% at the onset of 
the eHMI, intensity decreased linearly to 30% 
in 0.28 s, stayed at a constant level of 30% for 
0.24 s, and increased linearly to 100% in 0.28 
s again. The light band remained on until the

Each participant completed 50 trials. In each 
trial, the participant encountered a blue AV 
approaching from the right. Once the partici-
pant had triggered the start of the trial, the vehi-
cle appeared around the corner, initially out of 
sight, at a longitudinal and lateral distance from 
the pedestrian of 73 m and 22 m, respectively, 
and driving at a speed of 30 mph (48 kph).
Participants completed four blocks of tri-
als, consisting of 12 trials each. There was one 
failure trial after Block 3, to examine initial 
misuse, and another one after Block 4, to eval-
uate whether misuse persisted (Table 1). In the 
failure trial, the eHMI turned on, but the AV 
continued to drive at a constant speed. Table 2 
shows the number of trials per yielding condi-
tion within each block. The order of trials was

time since the start of the trial. Positions of 0 m, 
2.05 m, and 6.24 m correspond to the starting 
point, the nearest edge of the road, and the far-
thest edge of the road, respectively.
The following dependent measures were 
computed:
 
∆î Moment of entering the road in seconds since the 
start of the trial (s). This measure was computed 
only for trials in which the AV was yielding for 
the participant, because in nonyielding trials, the 
participants almost never entered the road.
 
∆î Pedestrian position when the car passed (m). 
For each trial in which the AV maintained

the moment the car passed the pedestrian. From 
this measure, we computed the percentage 
of participants who were on the road at the 
moment the car passed.
Procedure
After the participants entered the HIKER 
room, the researcher explained that the exper-
iment was aimed at studying the crossing 
behavior of pedestrians when interacting with 
AVs. Next, the participants read and signed the 
informed consent form. The form mentioned 
that if the eHMI is on, it means that the car is

times yields and sometimes continues driving 
without yielding. The task instructions were 
described as follows: ‚ÄúWith the glasses on, you 
will look to the corner on the right and take one 
or two steps forward. The car will then appear 
from the right corner. You will then move for-
ward along the pavement and decide to cross, or 
not, depending on the yielding behavior of the 
vehicle.‚Äù
Next, participants were asked to complete 
a demographic questionnaire and a practice 
session. They were verbally briefed by the 
researcher in the simulator on how to trigger 
the onset of the car, to cross the road, and

Participants initially stood on the edge of 
the pavement in the simulator. The approach 
of the AV was automatically triggered based on 
WKHSDUWLFLSDQW¬∂VKHDGDQJOHDQGSRVLWLRQLQWKH
simulator. The participant then moved forward 
and decided whether or not to cross in front of 
the approaching AV. After crossing, the partici-
pants returned to the starting position and ver-
bally answered the three post- trial questions 
that appeared on their left, as shown in Figure 5. 
Once they provided a response to the questions, 
they were ready to start with the next trial.
After the experiment, the participants com-
pleted a post- experiment questionnaire. The 
post- experiment questionnaire consisted of 
questions regarding the experiment in general 
and a set of virtual presence questions (Witmer 
	 6LQJHU ). They were then reimbursed 
with ¬£10. The experiment lasted approximately 
1 hr per participant.

RESULTS
In each trial, the AV approached from a blind 
curve. This road layout ensured that participants 
could not see the AV arrive from a distance and 
was intended to prevent them from crossing the 
road in front of a nonyielding AV or before a 
yielding AV started to decelerate. An inspec-
tion of the results showed that some partici-
pants were on the road or had already crossed 
the road at the moment the nonyielding AV

pants walked quickly, sometimes without slow-

of the nonyielding AV, and in some cases were 
run over by it. These behaviors were regarded

DISCUSSION
Millard- Ball (2018) argued that AVs will 
always be risk- averse, which may cause pedes-
trians to misuse the AVs by crossing the road 
in a careless manner. In the present study, we 
focused on misuse caused by AVs that are 
equipped with a salient eHMI in the form of a 
light band. We hypothesized that participants 
would trust the AV with an eHMI more than the 
AV without an eHMI, but would lose trust if the 
eHMI failed, yet trust would recover quickly. 
We further expected that pedestrians would 
cross earlier when the eHMI onset was early, as 
compared with late eHMI onset.

trust, higher comprehension, and lower risk,

ZDVR‡µµ7KHVHUHVXOWVUHSOLFDWHHDUOLHUUHVHDUFK
(de Clercq et al., 2019; Faas et al., 2020) that 
showed that after a short instruction/training, 
eHMIs induce trust and stimulate pedestrians to 
cross, especially if the eHMI turns on before the 
vehicle starts to decelerate. Earlier studies sug-
gest that a light- based eHMI is initially incom-
prehensible to users, but that people can learn 
its meaning with only a few trials of practice 
(de Clercq et al., 2019; Habibovic et al., 2018; 
Hensch et al., 2020). The high comprehension 
ratings from the very start of the experiment 
(Figure 8, right top) indicate that the light band 
eHMI was indeed easily understood.
7KH¬øUVWIDLOXUHWULDOVKDGVWURQJH‡µµHFWVLQWKH
sense that in as much as 35% of the trials, par-
ticipants inadvertently entered the road, and the 
majority of participants expressed feeling a high 
level of risk. The results for perceived trust are 
consistent with Holl√§nder et al. (2019) and Lee 
and Moray (1992), who found that when par-
ticipants experienced a failure of the automated 
system, their trust declined strongly. As shown 
in Figure 9, some participants walked more than 
1 m onto the road when the AV drove by, which 
meant the AV crashed into them. Figure 10 
illustrates that these participants started walking 
immediately after the eHMI turned on and real-
ized too late that the AV would not slow down. 
In other words, roughly one- third of the partic-
ipants relied on the explicit communication of 
the eHMI while initially ignoring the vehicle- 
intrinsic information, whereas the remaining 
participants appeared to rely more strongly on 
WKH$9¬∂VLPSOLFLWFRPPXQLFDWLRQIRUGHFLGLQJ
whether to step onto the road. The perceived 
risk, comprehension, trust, and time of entering 
the road recovered immediately after the fail-
ure trial. However, compared with the crossing

STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS
This study was conducted in a CAVE simula-
tor, where participants were able to move freely 
and could also see their own body in the envi-
ronment, something that is not possible in most 
simulators that use head- mounted displays. 
This is a likely explanation for the high pres-
HQFHUDWLQJVUHJDUGLQJ¬≥SUR¬øFLHQF\LQPRYLQJ
and interacting with the virtual environment‚Äù 
VHH WKH 6XSSOHPHQWDO 0DWHULDOV $ OLPLWD-
tion of our study is that the simulator did not 
include sound. Furthermore, some participants 
verbally commented that the display resolution 
and quality were not great. This limitation can 
be explained by the stereo glasses themselves, 
and the fact that the stereo simulation could be 
only run at a slightly reduced resolution than the 
achievable 4K resolution by all eight projectors. 
Another limitation is that our study involved 
only one AV in a single lane, and therefore 
did not examine eHMI misuse in cases where 
pedestrians have to distribute their visual atten-
tion among multiple actors.
CONCLUSIONS AND 
RECOMMENDATIONS
The results from this study clearly show that 
pedestrians are prone to misusing an eHMI after 
repeated exposure to that eHMI. In other words,

that when an eHMI signals the intent of the AV

causes the pedestrians to cross earlier, as com-

understanding is required about whether pedes-

made aware of the capabilities of the automated 
driving system, especially if the automation is 
prone to malfunction. For example, pedestri-
ans could be made aware that an eHMI might 
turn on when the AV detects a pedestrian but 
will not yield for that pedestrian (but for another 
pedestrian instead). The present study showed 
that this type of failure caused some pedestri-
ans to crash with the AV. It may be expected 
that the autonomous emergency braking (AEB) 
systems of future AVs will be able to alleviate 
the impact, although the extent to which this 
is possible would depend on how early the AV

intentions (Kooij et al., 2019). Education could 
help pedestrians maintain a calibrated amount 
of trust and could prevent misuse and disuse 
of the automated driving system. For example, 
pedestrians may be taught that eHMIs do not 
necessarily address the pedestrian himself, but 
could also address other pedestrians or road ele-
ments, such as a zebra crossing further down the 
road (and see Boelhouwer et al., 2020, for rel-
evant recommendations regarding information- 
provision for in- vehicle automation systems).
