Abstract
A direct one-pot base-induced alkenylation of indolin-2-ones has been developed by using 6-aryl-4-methylthio-2H-pyran-2-one-3-
carbonitriles. Different bases such as MeONa, NaH and t-BuONa have been used to optimize the reaction conditions to obtain the
desired product. NaH in THF was found to be the most suitable for the alkenylation of indolin-2-ones. Reaction in the presence of
other bases led to the formation of 1-aryl-3-methoxy/methylthio-5H-dibenzo[d,f][1,3]diazepin-6(7H)-ones. Quantum chemical
calculations have been performed to explain the nature of the weak noncovalent interactions operating in the supramolecular archi-
tectures of alkenylated indoline-2-ones and to explain the relative stability of one of the tautomers with respect to the others.

Introduction
6-Aryl-4-methylthio-2H-pyran-2-one-3-carbonitriles have
emerged as versatile synthons for the construction of an array of
arenes and heteroarenes through base-induced ring transforma-
tion by nitrogen, sulfur and carbon nucleophiles [1]. However,
suitably functionalized 2H-pyran-2-ones have not been investi-
gated for the alkenylation of indolin-2-ones. An extensive
literature survey on the pharmacological properties of
3-alkenylindolin-2-ones revealed that they possess potent anti-
tumor [2-5], antipyretic [6], antifungal [7,8], anti-inflammatory
[9], and analgesic [9] activities. In addition, they also act as
inhibitors of lipoxygenase and butyrylcholinesterase enzymes
[10].
While alkylations and arylations of indole are well documented
in the literature [11-19], acid-catalyzed alkenylation by α-oxo
ketene dithioacetals [20] have only recently been reported.
There are plenty of literature reports available on the construc-
tion of 3-alkenylindolin-2-ones [21]. The widely used highly

facile protocol for the alkenylation of indolin-2-ones is through
aldol condensation [22] of isatin with compounds containing an
active methylene group as well as by Wittig reaction [23,24].
The growing importance of 3-alkenylindolin-2-ones has
resulted in the design of numerous new synthetic routes.
Recently, metal-catalyzed carbonylative annulation of alkynyl-
arylamines has been employed for the synthesis of this class of
compounds [25-31]. More recently, Kamijo, Yamamoto and
co-workers [32] have developed a palladium-catalyzed cycliza-
tion of acetylenic aryl isocyanates in the presence of terminal
alkynes. Halogenated arylpropionamides are commonly
employed for the preparation of 3-alkenylindolin-2-ones
involving tin hydride-AIBN initiated radical cyclization [33,34].
In 2005, Player and co-workers reported a tandem Heck/
Suzuki–Miyaura coupling process for the synthesis of (E)-3,3-
(diaryl)oxindoles [35-37]. Recently, alkenylation of indolin-2-
ones has been developed by palladium-catalyzed aromatic C–H
activation/Heck reaction starting from N-acryloylanilides [38].
The use of metal catalysis, especially of palladium, has played a
major role in the construction of 3-alkenylindolin-2-ones [38].
Despite significant progress in approaches for the construction
of 3-alkenylindolin-2-ones, use of complicated precursors,
expensive and sensitive metal catalysts, harsh reaction condi-
tions and incompatibility of reagents towards the functional
groups, restricted their frequent application. Thus, development
of new efficient routes by direct alkenylation, free from the
shortcomings of past procedures, is highly demanding and
remains a challenge to the state-of-art synthesis. The promising
pharmacological activities of 3-alkenylindolin-2-ones,
prompted us to develop an efficient and concise route for their
construction. Based on the topography and electronic features
of 6-aryl-4-methylthio-2H-pyran-2-one-3-carbonitriles 3, we
envisioned their use to alkenylate indolin-2-ones to deliver
3-alkenylindolin-2-ones. An extensive literature survey revealed
that 6-aryl-4-methylthio-2H-pyran-2-one-3-carbonitriles 3 have
never been employed to alkenylate indolin-2-ones.
Results and Discussion
Synthesis
Herein, we report a short and efficient approach for the alkeny-
lation of indolin-2-ones by suitably functionalized 6-aryl-4-
methylthio-2H-pyran-2-one-3-carbonitriles 3. The precursor 3
was prepared from the reaction of methyl 2-cyano-3,3-
dimethylthioacrylate [39,40] (1) and aryl methyl ketone (2) in
the presence of powdered KOH in DMF at room temperature as
reported earlier [41,42] (Scheme 1).
The reaction between indolin-2-one (4) and 6-aryl-4-
methylthio-2H-pyran-2-one-3-carbonitriles 3 in the presence of
t-BuOK/MeONa in tert-butanol/methanol under reflux resulted
in 1-aryl-3-methylthio-5H-dibenzo[d,f][1,3]diazepin-6(7H)-

ones (5, Figure 1) instead of the mechanistically possible prod-
ucts 2-phenyl-3,6-dioxa-4,5-dioxonaphtho[2,1-b]-7H-indole 6
or a carbazole derivative 7 or 3-alkenylindolin-2-ones 8
(Scheme 2 and Scheme 3).
Further, reactions of 3 and 4 in the presence of NaH as a base in
THF under reflux gave a product entirely different from 5, 6
and 7. The isolated product was finally characterized by single-
crystal X-ray diffraction as (2Z,5E)-5-aryl-3-methylthio-5-(2-
oxoindolin-3-ylidene)pent-2-enenitrile 8. The reaction is initi-
ated with Michael addition at C6 followed by ring opening with
elimination of carbon dioxide to deliver product 8 without

undergoing further cyclization to yield either 6 or 7, possibly
due to the lower dielectric constant of THF (7.42) compared to
methanol (32.7) (Scheme 3).
Figure 2: ORTEP view with atom numbering scheme of compound
8yc with displacement ellipsoids at the 30% probability level.
As is evident from Scheme 3, there are three possible
tautomeric forms for 8, viz. 8x, 8y, 8z for the isolated com-
pound. Single-crystal X-ray studies revealed that out of the
three tautomeric forms, the 8y is the most suitable structure
based on the bond lengths. Quantum chemical calculations have
been performed in order to gain information regarding the rela-
tive energy difference, which in turn reflects the relative
stability between the tautomeric forms 8x, 8y and 8z. The
energy calculations at the DFT level of theory for all of the
three tautomers indicate that 8y is 17.07 kJ·mol−1 more stable
than 8x, and it is more stable than 8z by 14.84 kJ·mol−1. A deep
structural study of 8y indicates the formation of intramolecular
C–H…O interaction which may be responsible for its extra
stability compared to 8x and 8z. However, for 8z the formation
of intramolecular C–H…O interactions is also possible, but the
existence of the relatively more stable trans-8z nullifies the
likelihood of this type of interaction. Hence, density functional
theory (DFT) calculations also indicate that the tautomer 8y is
relatively more stable than 8x and 8z (Figure 2).
Further, in order to generalize the reaction, attempts were made
for the alkenylation of indolin-2-one with 6-aryl-4-sec-amino-
2H-pyran-2-one-3-carbonitriles 9 [41,42], obtained by the
amination of 3 with sec-amine in boiling ethanol to yield a sec-
amino substituted alkenylated chain on position 3 of the
indolin-2-one (4). But to our utmost surprise the expected
alkenylated product 11 could not be isolated. However, in lieu
of this, the product isolated was characterized as 1-aryl-3-sec-
amino-5H-dibenzo[d,f][1,3]diazepin-6(7H)-one 10. The forma-
tion of 10 is possible only if the reaction is initiated with
Michael addition of indolin-2-one at C6 not at C4, due to the
presence of the secondary amino group, which reduces its elec-
trophilicity. Thus, preferential attack by carbanion generated
from 4 at C6 was inevitable for the formation of 10 (Scheme 4).

X-ray crystallography
The molecular view (ORTEP) for the compounds 8yc with its
atom numbering scheme is presented in Figure 2. The com-
pound 8yc crystallizes in a monoclinic crystal system having
P21/c space group with four molecules in the unit cell. The
rings A and B are coplanar with respect to each other. However,
the dihedral angle between the rings A and C is 73.52°. The
bond lengths C2–C9, C9–C10, C9–C15, C10–C11 and
C11–C12 have dimensions 1.348(5), 1.513(5), 1.501(7),
1.510(5) and 1.331(5) Å, respectively. The angles
<C2–C9–C15, <C2–C11–C12 have magnitudes of 119.7(4)°,
123.2(3)° and 123.2(4)°, respectively.
The supramolecular aggregations in 8yc are stabilized by a pair
of weak C−H…π interactions (Figure 3) that led to the forma-
tion of a centrosymmetric dimer. The C–H…π interaction dis-
tance is 2.883 Å and the angle <C–H…π is 148.97°. Add-
itionally, the C5–H5…O1 intermolecular interactions lead to the
formation of a molecular chain having a H5…O1 interaction
length of 2.716 Å and a C5–H5…O1 interaction angle of
127.60° (Figure 4). Along with the C–H…O interactions the
molecule displays Ar–H…π interactions (Figure 5) having
H22…C18 and H22…C19 interaction distances of 2.783 and
2.794 Å, respectively.
In order to analyze the various interactions that lead to the
crystal structure, interaction energies and electrostatic poten-
tials were calculated for dimer fragments (Figure 5). The
analysis of the interaction energy in the crystal structures of 8yc
by means of the dimer unit bound by C–H…π, C–H…O and
Ar–H…π interactions at the DFT level of theory yields inter-
action energies of 22.33, 14.92 and 15.45 kJ·mol−1, respective-
ly. To confirm further the presence of these weak interactions,
bond critical points (bcp) were calculated for the different
dimers by using the atoms in molecules theory [43]. The bond
critical points observed between the interacting atoms confirm

the presence of weak noncovalent interactions between the two
molecules of 8yc. The value of electron density (ρ), Laplacian
of the electron density (
ρbcp), bond ellipticity (ε), electron
density (ρ), and total energy density (H) at the bond critical
point for all the three interactions are presented in Table 1. As
indicated in Table 1, the electron densities for all the three types
of interactions at the bond critical point (ρbcp) are less than
+0.10 au, which indicates closed-shell hydrogen bonding inter-
actions. Additionally, the Laplacians of the electron density
ρbcp in all the three cases are greater than zero, which indi-
cates the depletion of electron density in the region of contact
between the H…O and H…C atoms. The bond ellipticity (ε)
measures the extent to which the density is preferentially accu-
mulated in a given plane containing the bond path. The ε values
for all the three interactions indicate that these are not cylindri-
cally symmetrical in nature.

Conclusion
Owing to the numerous procedures known for the synthesis of
3-alkenyl-2-oxindoles being based on expensive catalysts, non-
commercially available precursors, and multistep time-
consuming synthetic protocols, the development of an efficient,
economical and short synthesis was inevitable and desirable. In
this regard, we have now developed an efficient new protocol
for the direct alkenylation of 2-oxindole by 6-aryl-4-methylthio-
2H-pyran-2-one-3-carbonitriles 3 to deliver 3-alkenyl-2-oxin-
doles 8 in moderate yield. This procedure is quite efficient,
noncatalytic, economical and easy in workup. Moreover, it
opens a new avenue for the synthesis of 3-alkenyl-2-oxindoles.
Furthermore, the synthesis of 8y and its relative stability with
respect to the other tautomers has been confirmed by single-
crystal X-ray analysis and quantum chemical calculations.
X-ray diffraction displayed various C−H…π, C−H…O and
Ar-H…π intermolecular interactions. These interactions have
been evaluated by quantum chemical calculations.

Synthesis of 1-phenyl-3-(methylthio)-5H-
dibenzo[d,f][1,3]diazepin-6(7H)-one (5)
A mixture of indoline-2-one (4, 1.1 mmol) and 2-pyranone (3,
1.0 mmol) and t-BuOK (2.1 mmol) in methanol/t-BuOH
(10 mL) was heated under reflux for 6 h and was monitored by
TLC. After completion of the reaction, the excess of solvent
was removed under reduced pressure and the reaction mixture
was poured onto crushed ice with vigorous stirring. The
aqueous reaction mixture was neutralized with dilute HCl and
the resulting precipitate was filtered, washed with water and
dried. The crude product was purified by silica gel column
chromatography using chloroform/hexane as eluent to afford
product 5 (analytical data and spectra are given in Supporting

and indolin-2-one (4, 1.1 mmol) in dry THF (10 mL) was
heated under reflux for 4–5 h. The excess of solvent was

Structure determination
Intensity data for the yellow colored crystals of 8y and 5 were
collected at 298(2) K on an OXFORD CrysAlis diffractometer
system equipped with a graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radia-
tion source, λ = 0.71073 Å. The final unit cell determination,
scaling of the data, and corrections for Lorentz and polarization
effects were performed with CrysAlis RED [44]. The structures
were solved by direct methods (SHELXS-97) [45] and refined
by a full-matrix least-squares procedure based on F2 [46]. All
the calculations were carried out using WinGX system Ver-1.64
[47]. All nonhydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically;
hydrogen atoms were located at calculated positions and refined
using a riding model with isotropic thermal parameters fixed at
1.2 times the Ueq value of the appropriate carrier atom.

Computational details
Geometric characterization of all of the three tautomers of 8yc
was performed at the level of density functional theory (DFT)
using the B3LYP functional [48,49]. For all the atoms 6-31G**
basis sets were used. All calculations were performed using the
Gaussian 03 program [50]. The intermolecular interaction ener-
gies were estimated at the MP2 level of theory. For the inter-

action energy calculations, the C–H…π, Ar–H…π and Ar–H…O
distances were fixed for the dimer while all other degrees of
freedom were relaxed in the geometry optimization. The magni-
tude of the energy corresponding to this dimer was subtracted
from twice the energy of the monomer. The intermolecular
interaction strengths are significantly weaker than either ionic
or covalent bonding, therefore it was essential to perform basis
set superposition error (BSSE) corrections. The BSSE correc-
tions in the interaction energies were carried out using
Boys–Bernardi scheme [51]. In this paper all interaction ener-
gies are reported after BSSE correction.
