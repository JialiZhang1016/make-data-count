Abstract
Background: Ethylene promotes fruit ripening whereas 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), a non-toxic antagonist of
ethylene, delays fruit ripening via the inhibition of ethylene receptor. However, unsuitable 1-MCP treatment can cause
fruit ripening disorders.
Results: In this study, we show that short-term 1-MCP treatment (400 nL•L−1, 2 h) significantly delays papaya fruit ripening
with normal ripening characteristics. However, long-term 1-MCP treatment (400 nL•L−1, 16 h) causes a “rubbery” texture of
fruit. The comparative transcriptome analysis showed that a total of 5529 genes were differently expressed during fruit
ripening compared to freshly harvested fruits. Comprehensive functional enrichment analysis showed that the metabolic
pathways of carbon metabolism, plant hormone signal transduction, biosynthesis of amino acids, and starch and sucrose
metabolism are involved in fruit ripening. 1-MCP treatment significantly affected fruit transcript levels. A total of 3595 and
5998 differently expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between short-term 1-MCP, long-term 1-MCP treatment and the
control, respectively. DEGs are mostly enriched in the similar pathway involved in fruit ripening. A large number of DEGs
were also identified between long-term and short-term 1-MCP treatment, with most of the DEGs being enriched
in carbon metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, plant hormone signal transduction, and biosynthesis of
amino acids. The 1-MCP treatments accelerated the lignin accumulation and delayed cellulose degradation during fruit
ripening. Considering the rubbery phenotype, we inferred that the cell wall metabolism and hormone signal pathways
are closely related to papaya fruit ripening disorder. The RNA-Seq output was confirmed using RT-qPCR by 28 selected
genes that were involved in cell wall metabolism and hormone signal pathways.
Conclusions: These results showed that long-term 1-MCP treatment severely inhibited ethylene signaling and the cell
wall metabolism pathways, which may result in the failure of cell wall degradation and fruit softening. Our results
reveal multiple ripening-associated events during papaya fruit ripening and provide a foundation for understanding
the molecular mechanisms underlying 1-MCP treatment on fruit ripening and the regulatory networks.

Background
Papaya fruit is a popular fruit known for its sweet and
exotic flavor and nutritional value [1]. However, papaya is
highly perishable, ripens, and rapidly deteriorates after har-
vest, thus restricting its market promotion [2]. As a typical
climacteric fruit, the ripening of papaya is determined by
ethylene [3, 4]. 1-MCP has also been applied to maintain
papaya fruit quality and extend its shelf life [5, 6]. However,
inappropriate 1-MCP treatment tends to cause an elastic
state or “rubbery” texture in papaya [5, 7, 8]. A few studies
have focused on these issues, and the related mechanism
of this phenomenon has not been thoroughly investigated.
Ethylene is an important plant hormone that regulates
plant growth and developmental processes, including
ripening and senescence, and it also profoundly affects
the quality of harvested products [9]. Ethylene is known
to trigger ripening in climacteric fruits and senescence
in non-climacteric fruits, vegetables, and ornamental
plants [3]. Manipulating ethylene production is an effect-
ive way to either promote rapid and predictable ripening
of climacteric fruits or to delay ripening.
The postharvest technologies of controlling ethylene
and the ethylene pathway have been extensively studied
[5, 10, 11] .1-Methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) is an ethylene
receptor inhibitor and a non-toxic antagonist of ethylene
that has been employed to increase the shelf life of various
climacteric and non-climacteric fruits by effectively
delaying fruit ripening and softening [5, 12–17]. By
binding to ethylene receptors, 1-MCP acts as an effi-
cient antagonist and exerts a persistent effect. Fruit
producers have applied 1-MCP as a ripening delayer to
prevent non-homogeneous ripening or sudden softening
of fruits caused by exposure to exogenous ethylene or
poor postharvest handling [6]. The broad application
of 1-MCP advances commercial agriculture, as well as
improves our understanding and provides insights into
the mechanisms underlying plant ethylene responses.
However, several problems and questions relating to the
practical application of 1-MCP remain [14, 18]. For
example, 1-MCP treatment inhibits the production of
many volatile alcohols and esters [19] and causes core
browning [20] in apple and softening disorder in papaya
fruit [5]. Unsuitable 1-MCP treatment (long duration, high
treated concentration or low fruit maturity) may cause
banana to stay green or ripen with uneven color [14].
RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis is a powerful
tool commonly used to study transcriptomes [21,
22]. The present study aimed to explore the global
view of transcript level of papaya fruit treated with
or without 1-MCP treatment using RNA-Seq tech-
nique. Suitable and unsuitable 1-MCP treatments
were
conducted
to
study
the
transcriptomic
dif-
ferences between normal-ripening fruits and fruits
with ripening disorder to identify key factors involved in
papaya fruit ripening and ripening disorder caused by
1-MCP treatment.
Results
Physiological characterization during fruit ripening under
different 1-MCP treatments
Figure 1 shows that 1-MCP treatment delayed fruit ripe-
ning, including fruit coloring and softening (Fig. 1a–c), es-
pecially for the long-term 1-MCP treatment (400 nL•L−1,
16 h). Fruit ripening rapidly occurred in the control group.
Fruit coloring index rapidly increased from second day
after treatment in the control group. Both 1-MCP treat-
ments delayed fruit coloring, which turned completely
yellow during storage (Fig. 1a and b). In terms of fruit firm-
ness, the fruits in the control group rapidly softened on the
second day and declined to low level of 10 N on the sixth
day. Short-term 1-MCP treatment effectively delayed the
decrease in firmness, whereas fruits treated with long-term
1-MCP treatment remained firm during the entire storage
period (Fig. 1a and c). Both 1-MCP treatments significantly
reduced peak fruit respiration rates, and long-term 1-MCP
treatment severely inhibited fruit respiration (Fig. 1 d). For
ethylene production, both 1-MCP treatments decreased
the ethylene peak and reduced ethylene production during
the later storage period (Fig. 1e). Long-term 1-MCP treat-
ment more extensively repressed fruit respiration and
ethylene production. In general, while both 1-MCP treat-
ments delayed fruit ripening, long-term 1-MCP treatment
led to the “rubbery” fruit ripening disorder texture.
1-MCP treatments affect fruit cell structure during fruit
ripening
Fruit cell structure was intact, and cell outline was clear
in the freshly harvested papaya fruit (Fig. 2a1). The in-
dividual cells with a clear cellular framework were
arranged in an orderly and tight manner in the fruits that
were just harvested (Fig. 2a1), where this result also pre-
sented in the long-term 1-MCP-treated fruits (Fig. 2a3).
The cell wall shrank and degraded and was thinner and
obscure on the eighth day of storage (Fig. 2a2). The cell
wall ultrastructure observed by TEM showed similar
results with SEM. Fruits showed a complete cell wall
(CW) structure just after harvest on 0 day (Fig. 2b1 and
c1), which showed intact and clear cell organelle [micro-
fibrous filaments (MF), CH (chloroplast), SG (starch gra-
nules)]. Cell wall composition degraded completely and a
large amount of flocculent substance was observed in the
cytoplasm. The completed organelle structure could not
be found at this stage (Fig. 2b2 and c2). The cell wall
structure was still intact in 1-MCP-treated fruit at the
16th day (Fig. 2b3 and c3), partial degradation of the outer
cell walls were observed, and organelles not clear as the
fresh harvested, but they were much better than the

control; the cell structure was still complete and clear.
Some organelles still could be observed (Fig. 2c13).
RNA-Seq analyses for the transcriptome of fruit under
different 1-MCP treatments
A total of 144.35 gigabytes (Gb) of clean reads from the
samples were obtained following quality assessment and
data filtering. The average clear data for each sample
was about 5.28 Gb. The GC% of sequenced data from 21
libraries ranged from 44.55 to 46.05%, and the percent-
age of reads with an average quality score > 30 was about
91% (Additional file 6: Table S2), indicating that the
accuracy and quality of the sequencing data are sufficient
for further analysis. The general sequencing statistics are
shown in Additional file 6: Table S2. The mapping effi-
ciency of 21 samples to the papaya (C. papaya) genome
range from 69.23–78.77%, as shown in Additional file 6:
Table S2. Only uniquely mapped reads were used in the
subsequent analysis of gene expression profiles in different
treatment groups. The correlation coefficient analysis
between each pair of three biological replicates showed
that the estimated gene expression levels of any repli-
cate pair of each treatment were highly consistent with
each other (Additional file 1: Figure S1a), and the repli-
cates showed consistent expression level with each
other (Additional file 1: Figure S1b). However, different

samples using various treatments were differentially
expressed.
A total of 23,712 transcripts were identified from all
of the samples based on the blast, which accounted for
84.9% of the annotated genes in papaya (Additional file
10: Data S1). In addition, 1098 new genes were identified,
of which, 778 were annotated using BLAST. Approxi-
mately 27.17% of the genes showed very strong homology
(80–100%) to the gene sequences in the database and the
other 45.3% showed 60–80% identity (Additional file 2:
Figure S2a).
A total of 15,032 genes annotated in the GO database
were categorized into 50 functional groups, belonging to
three main GO ontologies: biological processes, cellular
components, and molecular functions (Additional file 1:
Figure S1c). The ‘metabolic process’ (9895 genes, 65.82%),
cellular process (8513 genes, 56.63%), and catalytic activity
(7630 genes, 50.75%) were the three predominant classi-
fications among the functional groups.
For COG analysis, 7112 putative proteins were clustered
into 25 functional categories. Among these, ‘general func-
tion prediction only’ (2094, 19.84%) accounted for the
largest fraction, followed by ‘transcription’ (10.23%) and
‘replication, recombination and repair’ (9.8%). In addition,
8.61% of assembled genes were assigned to signal trans-
duction mechanisms. The ‘cell wall/membrane/envelope
biogenesis’ category accounted for 2.39% (Additional
file 2: Figure S2b).
Transcriptomic analysis during fruit ripening
A total of 5529 genes were differently expressed (FC ≥
two-fold) during fruit ripening process compared to fruit
just harvested (1 DAT(days after treatment) vs. 0 DAT
and 6 DAT vs. 0 DAT) (Fig. 3a), of these differently
expressed genes (DEGs), 3081 were at 1 DAT, 3784 were
at 6 DAT, and 1336 DEGs were identified at both stages
(Fig. 3a). The number of DEGs increased following fruit
ripening (Fig. 3a).
KEGG analysis assigned the DEGs to 125 metabolic
pathways (each of which contained one or more DEGs)
(Additional file 11: Data S2). Figure 3b shows the 52
most enriched metabolic/biological pathways. Notably,
carbon metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids, starch
and sucrose metabolism, and plant hormone signal
transduction were the most enriched pathways, in which
84, 72, 65, and 59 DEGs were identified, respectively.
These results showed that the metabolic pathways of
carbon metabolism, plant hormone signal transduction,
biosynthesis of amino acids, and starch and sucrose
metabolism are important to fruit ripening (Fig. 3b).
The 20 most enriched GO terms are presented in Fig. 3c.
The cellular component of integral component of mem-
brane, chloroplast envelope, and plasma membrane were
the most enriched categories, including 325, 109, and 36
DEGs, respectively (Fig. 3c). In terms of biological process,
embryo development ending in seed dormancy, response
to hydrogen peroxide, DNA methylation, sterol bio-
synthetic process, and small GTPase-mediated signal
transduction are the most enriched categories. The
UDP-forming activity was the only molecular function
categories in the top 20 enriched GO terms. More
biological process categories were enriched than cellular
component and molecular function.
Around 73 genes were found to be involved in hormone
signal pathway, of which, 18, 36, 9, and 10 genes involved
in the ethylene signal pathway, auxin signal pathway,
abscisic acid (ABA) pathway, and gibberellin (GA) path-
way, respectively (Additional file 7: Table S3). Some genes
were selected (log 2 | FC| ≥2) and presented in Table 1.
Several important regulators involved in ethylene synthe-
sis and signal transduction were identified, including ERFs
(Ethylene-responsive transcription factor) (7), CTR1(1),
ACO (ACC oxidase) (1), and ERS (ethylene response
sensor) (1) (Table 1). The expression levels of three ERFs
were significantly repressed during fruit ripening, and
those of the other four ERFs were dramatically increased
during fruit ripening, especially for ERF-WRI1, which
reached more than [500-fold] on the sixth day compared
to 0 DAT (Table 1). The transcript levels of ACO and
CTR1 genes were enhanced with the fruit ripening
process. More DEGs involved in auxin transport, syn-
thesis, and signal transduction were identified during fruit
ripening (Table 1). Most auxin transport genes were
downregulated during fruit ripening, whereas auxin re-
sponsive genes, such as ARFs (Auxin response factors)
and IAAs (indoleacetic acid), were upregulated during
fruit ripening (Table 1). The three ABA receptor genes
were significantly upregulated with fruit ripening. Genes
involved in the GA pathway were also significantly
differentially expressed during fruit ripening (Table 1
and Additional file 7: Table S3).
More than 136 DEGs are involved in cell-wall metab-
olism (Additional file 8: Table S4), including cellulose
synthesis, sucrose synthase, pectin metabolism (PME,
PG, PE, GAUT), hemicellulose metabolism (EXP, EXY1,
β-GAL, BGL, EGase), and lignin metabolism (PAL, 4CL,
CCR, POD). Some selected important DEGs (log
2 |
FC| ≥2) involved in cell-wall metabolism are listed in
Table 2. Several of these genes were repressed with fruit
ripening, whereas most of them dramatically increased
during fruit ripening. The EXY1 gene was upregulated
by more than [2000-fold] on the first day of ethephon
treatment compared to 0 DAT, and PG gene was up-
regulated by more than [250-fold], too (Table 2). The
expression levels of other genes, such as Pectinesterase,
XTH1, and CS, were also significantly upregulated during
fruit ripening (Table 2 Additional file 8: Table S4). These
results coincided with the fruit softening phenotype.

Transcriptomic analysis after 1-MCP treatment
Figure 1 shows that 1-MCP treatments significantly de-
layed or inhibited fruit softening and ripening. To obtain a
global overview of the genes involved in 1-MCP response,
we analyzed the transcriptomes between control group
and 1-MCP treatments. Figure 4a shows that a total of
6459 genes were differently expressed (≥2-fold) between
1-MCP treatments (both long-term and short-term
1-MCP treatments) and the control. The number of
DEGs increased with storage time and duration of 1-MCP
treatment (Fig. 4a). 2932 DEGs were identified specifically
in each group, and 321 DEGs were identified in all of the
groups. A total of 3595 genes were differently expressed
between short-term 1-MCP treatment and the control

(Fig. 4a), of which 1446 were at 1 DAT, 2584 were at 6
DAT, and 435 were shared at both time points. A higher
number of DEGs were identified at 6 DAT than 1 DAT.
More DEGs were upregulated than downregulated at
1DAT. However, more DEGs were downregulated by 1-
MCP at 6 DAT (Additional file 3: Figure S3a). A higher
number of DEGs were identified under long-term 1-MCP
treatment, with a total of 5998 genes being differently
expressed between long-term 1-MCP treatment and the
control (Fig. 4a and. Additional file 3: Figure S3b). These
results indicated that 1-MCP significantly affects fruit
transcript levels, and long-term 1-MCP treatment induces
more severe effects.
For GO analysis, cellulose metabolic process, carotenoid
biosynthetic process, and chloroplast envelope were the
most significantly enriched terms in the short-term 1-
MCP vs. the control group (Additional file 3: Figure S3c).
For the comparison of long-term 1MCP vs. control group,
plasma membrane, cellulose metabolic process, root hair
elongation, and fatty acid biosynthetic process were the
most significantly enriched terms (Additional file 3: Figure
S3d). Figure 4b-c identify the 50 most enriched metabolic/
biological pathways for the comparison of the short-term
1-MCP vs. control and long-term 1MCP vs. control
group, respectively. Carbon metabolism, biosynthesis of
amino acids, starch and sucrose metabolism, and plant
hormone signal transduction were the most enriched
pathways in both comparison (Fig. 4b,c). However, much
more DEGs were enriched in each pathway for the
comparison of the long-term 1MCP vs. control group,. A
higher number of DEGs were also enriched in other
pathways for the long-term 1-MCP treatment than the
short-term 1-MCP treatment.
When long-term 1-MCP treatment was compared to
short-term 1-MCP treatment, a total of 1934 DEGs were
identified, which may play a role in the fruit ripening
disorder (Fig. 4d). Among which, 877 DEGs were at 1
DAT and 1057 were at 6 DAT, and 346 DEGs were
shared at both time points. GO categories analysis
showed that the most significantly enriched terms were
cell wall, membrane, negative regulation of catalytic ac-
tivity,
fatty
acid
biosynthetic
process,
oxidation-
reduction process, pectinesterase activity, and xyloglucan
(P < 0.0001) (Fig. 4e). The GO terms related to cell wall
metabolism were most significantly enriched.
KEGG analysis showed that the most enriched path-
ways were carbon metabolism, starch and sucrose me-
tabolism,
plant
hormone
signal
transduction,
and
biosynthesis of amino acids and glycolysis (Fig. 4f and
Additional file 4: Figure S4). These results showed that
the cell wall metabolism pathway and the plant hormone
signal transduction pathways were most enriched, indi-
cating that the cell wall metabolism pathway and hor-
mone signal pathways are closely related to papaya fruit
ripening disorder.
Candidate DEGs involved in fruit ripening
Figure 5 shows several selected DEGs involved in the
hormone signal pathway, cell wall metabolism, and cal-
cium signaling, which were significantly increased during
the fruit ripening process. However, the expression levels
of most of these genes were repressed by 1-MCP treat-
ments (Fig. 5). For example, genes involved in ethylene
synthesis ACO and signal transduction CTR1 and EIN3f
were significantly upregulated during fruit ripening, but

ponents involved in the jasmonic acid (JA), cytokinin
(CK), and GA pathways were also reduced by 1-MCP

treatments (Additional file 9: Table S5). Notably, genes
involved in cell wall metabolism dramatically increased
with fruit ripening, such as endoxylanase (EXY1), CS,
and Xyloglucan endotransglucosylase 30, but were se-
verely repressed by 1-MCP treatments. Calcium signal
also involved in fruit ripening, such as CML25 and
CBL-interacting protein, increased with fruit ripening.
The

DEGs related to cell wall metabolism
During fruit ripening, more than 300 DEGs were related
to cell wall structure (Table 2, Additional file 10: Data S1),
and GO and KEGG analyses showed that most cell wall
metabolism pathways are most enriched. 1-MCP treat-
ments delayed fruit softening and affected the expression
of cell wall metabolism-related genes (Additional file 12:
Data S3). Transcriptome analysis between short-term and
long-term 1-MCP treatments showed that a large number
of DEGs were enriched in cell wall metabolism term and
pathways (Fig. 4, Additional file 12: Data S3). Figure 6
shows the expression profiles of genes in lignin bio-
synthesis pathway, including most of the key players in lig-
nin biosynthesis (Fig. 6a). The expression of some gene
increased with fruit ripening, such as 4CL (evm.TU.super-
contig_233.15 (abbr. 233.15), 2471.2, 65.40), CHS (2.113),
CCR (40,679, 10.86, 246.14), COMT (3.161), F5H (6.209),
UFGT (8.266), and POD (8.232, 9.35, 23.12, 468.4).
However, all of these genes were significantly down-
regulated under 1-MCP treatments, especially by long-
term 1-MCP treatment (Fig. 6b). To the contrary, the
expression levels of other genes were decreased with fruit
ripening but induced by 1-MCP treatments, including
other 4CL (95.61, 13.155), CHS (30379), COMT (3.161),
UFGT (8.227), and 10 POD (Fig. 6b).
Similar to the genes involved in lignin metabolism,
some genes involved in cellulose, hemicellulose, and
pectin metabolism were dramatically increased during
fruit ripening but repressed by 1-MCP treatments. For
examples, the transcript level of EXY1, 5 EXP, 1 MUR4,
2 EGase, 5 β-GAL, 4 XIP, 2 xyl A, and 11 β-BGL genes
in hemicelluloses metabolism increased with fruit ripe-
ning, but were severely repressed by 1-MCP treatments,
especially for EXY1(106.45), EXP (1.419, 19.63, 26.280),
MUR4 (285.6), EGase (180.8, 2.231), β-GAL (37.20,
93.34), XIP (3.439, 37.58, 5.122), and β-GAL (1.407,
189.36) (Figs. 6 and 7). Other genes showed the opposite
expression patterns, which were downregulated with
fruit ripening, and induced by 1-MCP treatment, espe-
cially for EGase (27,379.2, 3.307), β-GAL (150.58, 32,583,
99.11), XIP (684.2, 231.7, 31,827.1), and β-GAL (29.126,
3.108, 116.58, 2.222) (Fig. 7). For the cellulose pathway,
the expression levels of most PYR, 4 CS, and 2 SS genes
increased with fruit ripening and were reduced by 1-
MCP treatments. The expression levels of GP, 2 PYR,
and 6 CS decreased with fruit ripening, but were up-
regulated by 1-MCP treatments (Fig. 7). For pectin meta-
bolic pathway, the expression levels of 4 GalAT, 4 GAE, 4
GAUT, 7 PE, 4 PG, and 4 PME were repressed by 1-MCP
treatments. The expression levels of other genes, including
1 GP, 6 CS, 5 GalAT, 1 GAE, 4 GAUT, 10 PE, and 9
PME, were induced by 1-MPC treatments (Fig. 7).
Verification of DEGs by RT-qPCR
Figure 8 shows that although the fold-changes in tran-
script levels determined by qRT-PCR and RNA-Seq did
not match exactly, the expression patterns from the two
platforms were largely consistent in that the expression
trends were quite similar for all of the 28 genes between
the qRT-PCR analyses RNA-Seq results (Fig. 8). These
results indicated that the expression profiles of these
representative genes tested in the RNA-seq assay coin-
cided with the results of RT-qPCR analysis (Fig. 8). For
the six genes involved in ethylene signal pathway, ACS10,
EBF1, EIN4, ERF and ERF110 are positively related with
fruit ripening, whose expression increased with fruit
ripening. Among them, ERF and ERF110 shows sharp in-
creasing with fruit ripening, which more than1000-fold
and 15-fold increasing for ERF and ERF110, respectively.
ERF110 showed more rapidly response which increased
dramatically at 1 DAT. However, ERF sharply increased at
6 DAT, which may related to fruit senescence regulation.
1-MCP treatments severely repressed their expression,
especially for the long-term 1-MCP treatment. The
expression of EIN3 kept at stable level during fruit ripe-
ning, but 1-MCP treatments induced its expression. For
the 22 genes involved in cell wall metabolism, among
them, the expression of BGL17, BGL32, EXPA4, EXPA11,

increased sharply with fruit ripening, but severely re-
pressed by 1-MCP treatments, and long-term 1-MCP
showed more severe repression than short-term 1-MCP
treatment, indicating these genes are important for fruit
ripening and closely related to fruit ripening disorder
caused by long-term 1-MCP. The expression of β-GAL,
POD20 and POD42 showed negative relationship with
fruit ripening, which decreased with fruit ripening and
induced by 1-MCP treatments (Fig. 8).
Cellulose and lignin changes during fruit ripening

cellulose during fruit ripening (Fig. 9a). Cellulose was

evenly distributed on the cell wall and trace amounts of
lignin were observed (Fig. 9a). After four days of storage
of the control fruit, cellulose, and lignin content slightly
increased but cellulose content dramatically decreased at
eighth day. No significant changes of cellulose and lignin
observed for 1-MCP treated fruit at fourth day, but
dramatically increased at the eighth day (Fig. 9a). The
results were also confirmed by the determination of
lignin and cellulose (Fig. 9b and c). The content of cellu-
lose was significantly higher in the 1-MCP-treated fruit
than the control (Fig. 9b). Lignin content in the con-
trol fruits slightly decreased with fruit ripening, but it
increased under 1-MCP treatments (Fig. 9c). These
results suggest that 1-MCP promotes the accumulation of
cellulose and lignin and inhibits their degradation during
fruit ripening.
Discussion
Plant hormones are essential to fruit ripening. Fruit ripe-
ning involves complicated changes in texture, sugar, color,
aroma, and flavor, and most of these events are controlled
by plant hormones. Present work revealed that a large
number of genes were differently expressed (FC ≥two-
fold) during fruit ripening compared to freshly harvested

fruits, and carbon metabolism was the most enriched
pathway by KEGG analysis. Plant hormone signal trans-
duction, amino acids biosynthesis, and starch and sucrose
metabolism were also the most enriched pathways during
fruit ripening, indicating that these processes are involved
in fruit ripening. It is well known that ethylene plays a
major role in the ripening process of climacteric fruits
[3, 9]. Three ERFs were significantly repressed during
fruit ripening, and another four ERFs dramatically
increased during fruit ripening in present work. More
genes involved in auxin transport, synthesis, and signal
transduction were identified during fruit ripening (Table 2).
Several ABA receptor genes were significantly upregulated
with fruit ripening. In banana and tomato fruits, ABA,
IAA, and ethylene play important roles in fruit ripening
[23–25]. In tomato, exogenous ABA treatment promoted
ethylene synthesis and fruit ripening, whereas repressing
ABA levels by the ABA biosynthesis inhibitor resulted in
delayed fruit ripening and softening [24]. The contents of
auxin and ABA increased during papaya fruit ripening.
Thus, we propose that auxin and ABA may participate in
papaya fruit ripening.
For climacteric fruits, such as tomato, banana, peach,
kiwifruit, papaya, and apple, ethylene plays an important
role in coordinating the physiological modifications during
the ripening [3]. Acting as the inhibitor of ethylene per-
ception, 1-MCP has drawn increasing attention. 1-MCP
works on a broad range of fruits, vegetables, and flori-
culture crops for preventing the ethylene effect and serves
as a useful tool to extend the shelf life and improve the
quality of fruits, such as plum [26], tomato [17], kiwifruit
[12], apple [15, 20], banana [14, 18], and papaya [5, 6]].
However, several studies showed that 1-MCP treatment
may have adversely effects on fruit quality. For example,
1-MCP treatment caused flesh browning in unstored
apricot fruits [27], in stored peaches [28], and nectarines
[29]. It appears that 1-MCP increases storage flesh dis-
orders. Unsuitable 1-MCP treatment also causes rubber
pulp in papaya fruit [6, 7, 30] . In the present study, short-
term 1-MCP delayed the ethylene peak and repressed
ethylene production, delayed the fruit softening, and
maintained fruit quality, which was consistent with pre-
vious studies on papaya [5]. Comparative transcriptome
analysis showed that a large number of DEGs were iden-
tified between the control group and 1-MCP treatments.
A lot of genes involved in fruit ripening were repressed by
1-MCP treatments, especially those genes involved in
the hormone pathway and cell wall metabolism. How-
ever, the respiration peak was nearly abolished due to
long-term 1-MCP treatment, resulting in rubbery pulp.
The absence of climacteric may result in undesirable
hardness in the pulp. Transcriptomic analyses showed that
the cell wall metabolism and hormone signaling pathways
were most enriched and might be important papaya fruit
ripening disorder.
Ethylene was strongly reduced by 1-MCP treatment in
apple, accompanied by the delayed ripening phenotype
[15]. However, the effects of 1-MCP treatments on
peaches and nectarines are only limited to the incubation
period [29]. Fruit ripening recovered rapidly after removed
from the treatment in both peaches and nectarines [28].
Ethylene biosynthesis is strongly inhibited by 1-MCP
treatment in apples, but its production in peaches was not
reduced by 1-MCP [15, 29]. These results indicate that the
effects of 1-MCP treatment may be dependent on the fruit
ripening stage, fruit cultivar, and the turnover of the ethy-
lene receptors [15, 29]. It has been proposed that the
recovery of ethylene sensitivity is mainly due to the
appearance of new receptors after 1-MCP treatment
[15]. For example, the transcription levels of two recep-
tor genes, ETR1 and ERS1, were almost not affected by
1-MCP and ETR2 expression recovered when treated fruit
were transferred to air [31]. 1-MCP application on fruits
can mimic the ethylene binding deficiency of never ripen-
ing mutant of tomato (Nr). In our case, long-term 1-MCP
treatment caused the failure in papaya fruit softening,
which was similar to the ripening mutant. In apple, the
interference of ethylene action at the receptor level
by 1-MCP treatment significantly repressed a group
of genes involved in the ethylene signal pathway
(ACS, ACO, ETR, and ERF) [32]. Genes involved in ethy-
lene biosynthesis and perception also showed different
expression patterns in peach fruit. ACO1 and ETR2 were
repressed by 1-MCP treatment, but ACS1, ETR1, and
ERS1 were not or slightly affected by 1-MCP in peach
[28]. In apple, ACS1 but not ACO1, was suppressed
by 1-MCP treatment [32]. About 61.8% of the DEGs
between control and 1-MCP treated samples were down-
regulated in apple, and another 38.2% of the DEG set were
positively regulated by 1-MCP, most of which are trans-
cription factors (ERF, NAC, MADS, and AUX/IAA) and
protein factors involved in the chlorophyll machinery [32].

Cell wall degradation is important trait for fruit quality,
which is differentially regulated during the fruit develop-
ment and the ripening process. Previous work reported
that more than 50 cell wall structure-related genes are
expressed during fruit development in tomato [33]. Most
of the genes in the cell wall metabolsim were described by
Paull et.al [34]. For example, expansins protein are
important for fruit softening, and at least 15 CpEXPA,
three CpEXPB and one CpEXPLA were isolated from
papaya genome, and four of them increased with fruit
ripening [34, 35]. Five SS were isolated, different gene
numbers of lignin synthesis also isolated from papaya
genome [34]. Notably, in the present study, more than
136 DEGs that are involved in cell-wall metabolism were
identified, including cellulose synthesis, sucrose meta-
bolism, pectin metabolism, hemicellulose metabolism,
and lignin metabolism, and most of them dramatically
increased during fruit ripening. Cell wall thickness

and strength are key components in the maintenance
of fruit firmness [36], and the textural changes during
fruit ripening process are due to the changes in cell
components and structure, especially those directly
impacting cell wall thickness and strength. In the
present work, the integrity of the cell wall was well
maintained in the long-term 1-MCP treatment, which
helps to maintain the abnormal fruit firmness and lead to
the softening failure. Therefore, cell wall metabolism may
be the key point for the fruit ripening disorder caused by
1-MCP.
Cell wall metabolism is one of the major events during
fruit ripening, and diverse cell wall-modifying proteins,
including enzymes for cellulose and pectin catabolism,
are
involved
in
the
dismantling
of
these
multiple
polysaccharide networks. Carbohydrates play an impor-
tant role in the fruit ripening process, leading to the re-
duced molecular size and the increasing ripening levels
[37]. Starch, cellulose, pectin, and hemicelluloses are the
major classes of cell wall polysaccharides that dramatically
change during ripening [37, 38]. A number of genes in-
volved in the cell wall polysaccharides were significantly
repressed by long-term 1-MCP treatment.
Lignin is one of the most abundant polyphenolic poly-
mers in higher plants just after cellulose, functioning as
the structural support of the cell walls, water tightness,
and response to environmental stimuli [39, 40]. The acti-
vities of POD, PAL, C4H, and 4CL are positively corre-
lated with lignin accumulation in loquat fruit [41, 42]. To
date, no plant enzymes have been reported to degrade

lignin due to its complicated structure in higher plants
[43]. Therefore, it is important to find the effective means
to inhibit lignin formation, rather than degrade or disperse
it. It has been reported that several postharvest ap-
proaches, such as 1-MCP, could inhibit lignification in
fruit, such as loquat [12, 44]. However, 1-MCP enhanced
lignification of loquat fruit during the later storage period
and induced enzymatic activities of PAL, CAD, and POD,
with a higher lignification incidence and lignin content
[12]. In stark contrast, the activities of PAL, CAD, and
POD and lignin accumulation were reduced by 1-MCP
treatment in postharvest bamboo shoots [45]. In the
present study, the lignin metabolism-related gene family
showed different expression patterns. Genes, including
4CL, CHS, CCR, COMT, F5H, UFGT, and POD, were
upregulated with fruit ripening but were significantly down-
regulated by 1-MCP treatments, especially by the long-
term 1-MCP treatment (Fig. 6b). Other gene families, such
as other members of 4CL, CHS, COMT (3.161), UFGT, and
POD, were downregulated with fruit ripening but were
upregulated by 1-MCP treatments (Fig. 6b), which may be
important to the rubbery pulp phenomenon.
Pectins are another group of important players that
regulating the texture and quality of fruit, and they are the
major components of primary cell wall and middle
lamella. Pectins are degraded with fruit ripening and
mainly contributed to fruit softening. Pectin-degrading
enzymes, including polygalacturonase (PG), pectin methy-
lesterase (PME), pectate lyase (PL), and rhamnogalacturo-
nase, are closely related to fruit-tissue softening [4, 38].
Genes involved in hemicellulose, cellulose, and pectin
metabolism showed the similar expression profiles to
those of genes involved in lignin metabolism (Fig. 7). For
example, some genes were dramatically increased during
fruit ripening but repressed by 1-MCP treatment, in-
cluding endoxylanase (EXP1), 5 EXP, 1 MUR4, 2 EGase, 5
β-GAL, 4 XIP, 2 xyl A, and 11 β-BGL genes in hemicellu-
loses (Fig. 7). Especially for EXP1, which dramatically
increased at 1 DAT (more than 2000-fold of 0 DAT) and
6DAT, but severely repressed by 1-MCP treatments, and
no expression detected in long-term 1-MCP treated fruit
(Fig. 5, Additional file 9: Table S5). It was well docu-
mented that endoxylanase play an important roles in fruit
softening, which expressed with fruit ripening and soften-
ing [7, 46]. Previous work also showed that 1-MCP-
treated fruit with ‘rubbery’ texture showed suppressed
endoxylanase gene expression, protein and enzymatic
activity [7]. All these results indicated that endoxylanase
may play important roles in 1-MCP induced ripening
disorder. Other genes showed the opposite expression
patterns, which decreased with fruit ripening, and they
were induced by 1-MCP treatments. Similar results also
observed in apple fruit treated with 1-MCP. 1-MCP treat-
ment repressed a majority of genes encoding cell wall
enzymes (50 of 77), such as pectinesterase, polygalacturo-
nase, and PL, and they also induced a specific group of cell
wall-related genes [32]. Additionally, the degradation
pectin and cellulose usually depends on ethylene produc-
tion during the ripening of climacteric fruits [37, 38]. A
close relationship exists between endo-PG and ethylene
production during peach fruit ripening, which marked
reduction of endo-PG expression in 1-MCP treated fruit
and severe inhibition of ethylene production [27]. PpEXP2
and PpEXP2 showed opposite expression patterns during
fruit ripening and 1-MCP treatment [27]. In papaya fruit,
The activities of hydrolases including endoglucanase,
β-galactosidase, PME, β-xylosidase and endoxylanase
were dramatically increased with fruit ripening, but 1-MCP
severely repressed their activities, which may correlated
“rubbery” texture caused by 1-MCP [8]. Our previous work
also showed that the activities of corresponding key en-
zymes for cell wall degradation in papaya, including
PME, PG, PL, and cellulase (CX), were also drama-
tically repressed by 1-MCP in papaya fruit [30]. These
enzymes play important roles in cell wall degradation,
in an coordinated and interdependent manner [38, 47].
The content of two key components of the cell wall,
cellulose and lignin, were relatively higher in 1-MCP-
treated fruits than the controls during storage, which
may account for the rubbery texture caused by long-
term 1-MCP treatment.
Conclusions
1-MCP treatment provides enormous information on
fruit ripening and ripening disorder caused by long-term
1-MCP application, especially fruit softening. A sum-
mary of the cell wall responses to 1-MCP treatment is
shown in Fig. 10. Suitable 1-MCP treatment reduced
ethylene production and cell wall polysaccharides and
enzymes activities, and it affected the lignin biosynthesis
pathway, which in turn delayed fruit softening. However,
long-term 1-MCP treatment severely inhibited the ethy-
lene biosynthesis and signal transduction pathway, and
then it resulted in the inhibition of cell wall enzymes
and polysaccharides activities, enhancing the lignin bio-
synthesis pathway. These actions effectively inhibited cell
wall thinning and cell wall loosening, and enhanced the
cell wall stiffening, which prevented fruit softening.
Methods
Plant materials and treatments
Papaya fruits (Carica papaya L., cv. Suiyou-2′) of color
break stage (5% < peer color < 15% yellow) were harvested
from a local commercial farm in Panyu District of
Guangzhou, Guangdong, South China. The fruit with simi-
lar size and free of blemishes were selected, first washed
with water, dipped in to 0.2% (w/v) hypochloride solution
for 10 min and then soaked in 500 mg•mL−1 mixture

solutions of iprodione (Kuaida, Jiangsu, China) and pro-
chloraz (Huifeng, Jiangsu, China) for 1 min to eliminate
potential microbes. After being air-dried at 22 °C, three
different treatments were performed, namely, 400 nL•L−1
of 1-MCP for 16 h (long-term 1-MCP), 400 nL•L−1 of
1-MCP for 2 h (short-term 1-MCP), and the control
group with 0 nL•L−1 of 1-MCP treatment. Then all of
the fruits were soaked in 1000 μL•L−1 ethephon solu-
tion for 1 min and placed into unsealed plastic bags
(0.02 mm thick) for ripening at 25 °C. For the control
treatment, samples were taken at 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 days. For
both 1-MCP treatments, samples were taken at 0, 1,
2, 4, 6, 8, 11, and 14 days after treatment (DAT).
Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at
−80 °C. All of the treatments were conducted with three
biological replicates.
Fruit firmness, respiration, ethylene production, and
coloring index assessment
Fruit firmness, respiration, ethylene production, and
coloring index assessment were determined as described
by Li et al. [48].
The content determination of cellulose and lignin
The cellulose content were determined as described
by Niu S [49], and lignin content was determined as
described by Ermakov et al. [50].

Ultrastructure and microstructure observations of the
fruit cell walls
Fruit tissues from different storage periods were taken and
fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 1% osmium tetroxide,
then treated as follows: they were washed with PBS (phos-
phate buffer saline) buffer, eluted with an ethanol gradient,
embedded in SPI812 resin, ultrasonically sectioned on an
Ultracut Uct (Leica, Germany), and stained with uranyl
acetate and lead citrate. Images were captured using a
transmission electron microscopy TECNAI-12 (PHILIPS,
Holland) using a 2KV accelerating voltage.
For observing the microstructure of the fruit cells,
pieces of fruits pulp (0.5 cm × 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm) were
taken, fixed, and then sectioned with a freezing micro-
tome set to 20-μm thickness. The thin layer samples
were visualized and analyzed under a fluorescence
microscope (Axioskop Plus, Germany).
cDNA library preparation and Illumina sequencing
Total RNAs were extracted from fruit pulp samples using
PureLinkR Plant RNA Reagent (Ambion, #12322–012),
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA concen-
tration was measured using NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo).
RNA integrity was examined using an RNA Nano 6000
Assay Kit and the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system
(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). RNA-
Seq libraries were generated using NEB Next UltraTM
RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, #E7530,
USA) following manufacturer’s recommendations, and
index codes were added to attribute sequences to each
sample. Fruit samples in the control, short-term and long-
term 1-MCP treatment groups after 0, 1, and 6 days of
storage were selected for transcriptomic analysis. Each
sample time point contained three biological replicates,
and a total of 21 libraries were constructed. All of the
libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq Xten
platform
by
the
Biomarker
Technology
Company
(Beijing, China).
Sequence assembly and functional annotation
Clean reads were mapped to the reference genome of pa-
paya (http://www.plantgdb.org/CpGDB/) using TopHat2
Software. The reads of each biological replicate were
mapped independently, and only reads with a perfect
match or one mismatch were further analyzed and anno-
tated based on the reference genome. Only uniquely
mapped reads were used in the subsequent analysis of
gene expression profiles in different treatment groups.
Sequences were aligned using BLASTx to non-redundant
protein databases (Nr) of the National Center for Bio-
technology Information (NCBI). Gene annotation was
performed using various methods, which were as follows:
Swiss-Prot protein databases, COG, KOG, and KEGG.
Coding sequences (CDS) of genes were predicted by Trans
Decoder Software (http://transdecoder.github.io).
Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEG)
Gene expression levels were estimated using the fragments
per kilobase of the transcript per million mapped reads
(FPKM) method [51]. DEGs were identified using the
DESeq Software [52] in pair-wise comparisons. The results
of all of the statistical tests were revised to account for
multiple testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg approach
for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR < 0.05). Genes
were determined to be significantly and differentially
expressed at a P value (< 0.05), and Fold change (FC) > 2.
Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of DEGs was
conducted using the GOseq R packages based Wallenius
non-central hyper-geometric distribution [53]. KOBAS
[54] software was used to test the statistical enrichment of
DEGs in the KEGG pathways.
Validation of DEGs by qRT-PCR
Twenty-eight genes involved in plant hormone signal and
cell wall metabolism pathway were selected for further
validation by RT-qPCR. Transcript levels of 6 genes are
involved plant hormone synthesis and signal transduction,
and 22 are involved in cell wall metabolism, including the
lignin metabolism, cellulose biosynthesis pathway, hemi-
cellulose metabolic pathway, and pectin metabolic path-
ways. Gene expression analyses were performed using the
quantitative real-time PCR analysis (RT-qPCR). Total
RNA was extracted using hot borate method [55].
RT-qPCR was performed according to our previously
optimized methods [56]. The primers of all of the
genes tested were listed in Additional file 5: Table S1.
CpTBP1 and CpACTIN were selected as reference
genes in papaya as validated previously [56]. Three tech-
nical replicates were included each biological replicate.
The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was based on Duncan’s
multiple range test (DMRT) in SPSS 19.0 (IBM, USA).
