Abstract
Background: Wolbachia are the most widely spread endosymbiotic bacteria, present in a wide variety of insects
and two families of nematodes. As of now, however, relatively little genomic data has been available. The
Wolbachia symbiont can be parasitic, as described for many arthropod systems, an obligate mutualist, as in filarial
nematodes or a combination of both in some organisms. They are currently classified into 16 monophyletic lineage
groups (“supergroups”). Although the nature of these symbioses remains largely unknown, expanded Wolbachia
genomic data will contribute to understanding their diverse symbiotic mechanisms and evolution.
Results: This report focuses on Wolbachia infections in three pseudoscorpion species infected by two distinct
groups of Wolbachia strains, based upon multi-locus phylogenies. Geogarypus minor harbours wGmin and Chthonius
ischnocheles harbours wCisc, both closely related to supergroup H, while Atemnus politus harbours wApol, a
member of a novel supergroup S along with Wolbachia from the pseudoscorpion Cordylochernes scorpioides
(wCsco). Wolbachia supergroup S is most closely related to Wolbachia supergroups C and F. Using target
enrichment by hybridization with Wolbachia-specific biotinylated probes to capture large fragments of Wolbachia
DNA, we produced two draft genomes of wApol. Annotation of wApol highlights presence of a biotin operon,
which is incomplete in many sequenced Wolbachia genomes.
Conclusions: The present study highlights at least two symbiont acquisition events among pseudoscorpion
species. Phylogenomic analysis indicates that the Wolbachia from Atemnus politus (wApol), forms a separate
supergroup (“S”) with the Wolbachia from Cordylochernes scorpioides (wCsco). Interestingly, the biotin operon,
present in wApol, appears to have been horizontally transferred multiple times along Wolbachia evolutionary
history.

Background
Wolbachia are endosymbiotic alpha-proteobacteria in-
fecting a broad range of arthropods and nematodes [1,
2]. The bacteria of this genus are considered to be the
most widely spread symbionts in the animal world, per-
haps infecting half of insect species [3–5]. Wolbachia
are
maternally
inherited
and
can
induce
variable
phenotypes in their hosts through mutualism or parasit-
ism [6–9]. Wolbachia are genetically diverse, as are the
interactions with their hosts [10, 11]. Currently, there is
a general consensus to classify them in monophyletic
lineage groups (“supergroups” A to R). Wolbachia be-
longing to supergroups C, D and J exclusively infect fil-
arial nematodes (Onchocercidae) [12–14]. Supergroup L
exclusively contains plant parasitic nematodes (Praty-
lenchidae) [15, 16]. Supergroup F Wolbachia is, so far,
the only clade composed by some strains infecting ar-
thropods and some infecting filarial nematodes [17, 18].
All other described supergroups exclusively infect ar-
thropods [19–23]. The proposed supergroup G members
[24] and R [25] are now considered to be part of super-
group B [26] and A [27], respectively, and are no longer
considered as separate supergroups.
In the last few years, the number of published Wolba-
chia genomes has increased and currently 48 draft and 21
complete genomes of Wolbachia are available at the NCBI
database. However, these data are not a good representa-
tion of the entirety of Wolbachia diversity. Indeed, among
the 21 complete genomes, 15 are symbionts of insects be-
longing to either supergroup A or B (including 7 strains
from species of Drosophila), 2 are symbionts of insects be-
longing to other supergroups (F and E) and 4 are symbi-
onts of nematodes (supergroups L, C or D). Wolbachia
has been identified in other arthropods, such as isopods
[28, 29] and arachnids [24]. Limited genomic data for iso-
pods are available, for example a draft genome of wCon,
infecting Cylisticus convexus and a draft genome of wVulC
infecting Armadillidium vulgare [30]. No genomic data is
available for arachnid symbionts while several studies
identified Wolbachia in spiders [24, 25, 31], mites [20] or
scorpions [32].
In the current study, we focused on the Wolbachia
symbionts of pseudoscorpions. Pseudoscorpions inhabit
wooded areas associated with rotting vegetation. Unlike
most arthropods, they are viviparous with embryos
obtaining nutrients from the maternal reproductive tract
[33]. The presence of Wolbachia was described for the
first time in pseudoscorpions in 2005 in Cordylochernes
scorpioides [34]. It has been reported that the endosym-
biont is responsible for the “male killing” phenotype in
C. scorpioides, associated with a high rate of spontaneous
abortion.
We examined the prevalence of Wolbachia infections
in pseudoscorpion population samples from an area in
Montpellier (France) where three different species of
pseudoscorpions were collected and determined to be
positive for Wolbachia infection. The molecular analyses
phylogenetically
identified
two
different
Wolbachia
groups, of which one strain is divergent from currently
accepted Wolbachia supergroups. We used Wolbachia
DNA enrichment capture [35, 36] to ensnare Wolbachia
DNA for genomic sequencing from this Wolbachia
strain, wApo, infecting Atemnus politus.
Results
Identification and evolution of Pseudoscorpions
In all, 94 pseudoscorpion specimens were collected from
an area of Montpellier (France). Sixty specimens were
morphologically identified as Atemnus politus (Simon,
1878), 24 specimens belong to the species Geogarypus
minor (Koch, 1873) and 10 specimens belong to the
species Chthonius ischnocheles (Hermann, 1804). The
specimen identification is consistent with the analysis of
the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene marker
(COI). The COI sequences of the specimens belonging
to Geogarypus minor are identical to each other and to
the sequence of Geogarypus nigrimanus (JN018180 spe-
cimen voucher MNHN-JAB62). The species Geogarypus
nigrimanus has been recently synonymized with Geogar-
ypus minor [37]. Regarding the produced COI sequences
of the specimens belonging to Chthonius ischnocheles
species, the specimens IV3–1, Q3–1, IV1–1 and Q4 are
between 99.8–100% identical and match the sequence of
Chthonius ischnocheles available at the NCBI database
(JN018172 specimen voucher MNHN-JAB62). The exist-
ence of cryptic species of Chthonius ischnocheles has
been documented [38] and the specimens IV-J5 and IV-
S1 form a paraphyletic group with the other Chthonius
ischnocheles (Fig. 1).
The COI sequences of the specimens identified as
Atemnus politus present more intraspecific variability:
calculated pairwise similarities range between 97.7–
99.8%. The blastn analysis [40] does not provide identifi-
cation of strongly similar sequences in databases; indeed
no COI sequences from species related to the Atemnus
genus have been deposited in the NCBI database. The
most similar COI sequence in the database belongs to
Atemnidae sp. JA-2011 voucher (JN018203), showing
only 79.74% similarity. The COI-based phylogeny indi-
cates that all the specimens of Atemnus politus form a
clade which is a sister group of the clade composed of
Paratemnoides sumatranus and Oratemnus curtus spe-
cies, both representatives
of the Atemnidae family
(Fig. 1). The COI analysis shows all specimens of Chtho-
nius ischnocheles form a sister group of other species be-
longing
to
Chthonius
species
(C.
tetrachelatus,
C.
dacnodes) (Fig. 1). To date, the only species of pseudo-
scorpion described as a Wolbachia host, Cordylochernes

scorpioides, belongs to the Chernetinae and is a sister
group to the Atemnidae family (including Atemnus poli-
tus) (Fig. 1).
Prevalence of Wolbachia infection
Wolbachia was detected by PCR amplification of wsp
and
gatB
markers
(see
Methods)
in
the
three
studied pseudoscorpion species and in accordance
with the generally used nomenclature of Wolbachia
strains, we have named these new strains according
to their hosts: wApol for bacteria infecting Atemnus
politus, wGmin for bacteria infecting Geogarypus
minor and wCisc for bacteria infecting Chthonius
ischnocheles.

The A. politus specimens have the highest prevalence
of Wolbachia infection with 43.3% positive samples (26
positive of 60 specimens examined). 16.7% of G. minor
individuals appear to be infected (4 positive of 24 speci-
mens examined), while only 10% of the C. ischnocheles
(1 positive of 10 specimens examined) show PCR ampli-
fication of the Wolbachia markers (Table S1).
The wApol draft genome and annotation
Two draft genomes were produced for wApol Wolbachia
from Atemnus politus (specimens K5 and K3) using tar-
get capture enrichment [35, 36]. For Illumina sequen-
cing, an enrichment of 45-fold was observed (0.4% of the
reads mapped to the draft genome without enrichment
against 18% with) and 50-fold enrichment was observed
with PacBio sequencing (0.8% of the reads mapped to
the draft genome without enrichment as opposed to
40.9% with). Unfortunately, the amounts of DNA avail-
able for the two specimens were low, and thus the
samples were processed simultaneously using individual
barcoded adaptors (see Methods) and for PacBio se-
quencing, relatively few total reads were produced
(Table 1). The hydrid de novo assembly allowed produc-
tion of two draft genomes. For specimen K5, a 373 con-
tig draft genome of 1,445,964 bp was obtained, with an
average G + C content of 35.6% (largest contig, 25,286
bp, N50 = 5741 bp, average sequencing depth of 420X).
For specimen K3, a 200 contig draft genome of 1,404,
177 bp was obtained, with an average G + C content of
35.49% (largest contig, 40,755 bp, N50 = 10,346 bp, aver-
age sequencing depth = 205X) (Table 1).
Among 221 single-copy orthologue genes conserved
among
proteobacteria
(BUSCOs
database),
155
are
present in the wApol K5 draft genome and 151 in wApol
K3, suggesting 70.2 and 69% complete BUSCOs, respect-
ively. This percentage can be used to assess the level of
completeness of genomes (see Methods). By comparison,
the Wolbachia from Drosophila melanogaster, wMel, has
a higher level of BUSCOs in the current analysis with
180 genes (81.4%) and Wolbachia from Pratylenchus
penetrans, wPpe, has a low level with 161 genes (72.9%)
(Table S2). The low level of BUSCOs observed for
wApol suggest that either the wApol draft is incomplete
or this genome is highly degraded as has been described
for
Wolbachia
from
Onchocerca
ochengi
(74.7%
complete BUSCOs) [44].
The Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) calculation
(see Methods) indicates that the two wApol drafts have
99% identity and they are most similar to wCle with 87%
identity (Fig. 2). According to the analysis of available
complete genomes, strains which are representative of
the same supergroup share more than 94% identity; for

example, 99% for wOo and wOv (from supergroup C),
94% for wPip and wTpre (from supergroup B) or 96%
for wMel and wCau (from supergroup A).
One thousand seven hundred forty-six coding se-
quences (CDS) were annotated using RAST from wApol
K5 and 2215 CDS from wApol K3. The high number of
CDSs might be explained by presence of multiple copies
of same genes due to incompleteness of the draft ge-
nomes. The two draft genomes contain a low number of
transposable elements (55 mobile elements, 16 group II
intron-associated genes, 52 ISs for K5; 35 mobile ele-
ments, 9 group II intron-associated genes, 36 ISs for K3)
compared to other Wolbachia strains infecting insects
(with the exception of wTpre), but a high number com-
pared to Wolbachia infecting filarial nematodes (Table
S3). Numerous phage-like genes were observed in the
wApol K5 draft genome, with 54 CDS (coding se-
quences)
detected
on
37
different
contigs
with
9
annotated as prophage sequences (Table S4). Fewer
phage-like genes were detected in the wApol K3 draft
genome, with 20 CDS detected on 12 different contigs
and only one annoted as a prophage sequence (Table
S4). The number of phage-like genes is highly variable
among the studied Wolbachia genomes and the number
observed in wApol is close to wMel (with 44 CDS) or
wCle (with 20 CDS). However, the variability in trans-
posable element and phage numbers observed between
the two wApol draft genomes suggests that the genome
sequences are incomplete.
Although the wApol drafts are likely not complete,
functional annotation of genes by KAAS highlights that
the biotin pathway is present, while it is absent in most
other studied Wolbachia (Table S5). Only wCle (super-
group F), wNfla, wNleu (supergroup A), wLug, wStri and
wVulC (supergroup B) have a complete biotin pathway.
Only bioC is not detected in the wApol K5 draft, but the
operon is detected on two contigs: the genes bioA and
bioD on contig #258 and the genes bioH, bioF and bioB
on contig #172 (Fig. 3a). In all studied Wolbachia which
contain the operon, the bioC gene is present between
the bioD and bioH genes and the absence might be due
to the fragmentation of the wApol K5 draft sequence

(Fig. 3a). For the wApol K3 draft genome, only one con-
tig (#148) containing bioH, bioF and bioB was detected.
The organization of the biotin operon appears to be con-
served between all Wolbachia genomes which contain
the complete pathway (Fig. 3a). The phylogenies of the
biotin genes (containing bioA, bioB, bioH, bioD and
bioF) shows that the biotin operon of wApol K5 is most
closely related to the operon of wCle (Fig. 3b).
Multi-locus phylogenies and phylogenomics
The analysis of Wolbachia in Geogarypus minor, wGmin,
was more complex. Two genes were sequenced for
wGmin, coxA and ftsZ, and only nested PCR provided
clean sequences to enable phylogenetic comparisons.
The Wolbachia phylogeny, based on the two genes,
identified two different sub-groups of Wolbachia in our
samples (Fig. 4a). The Wolbachia infecting Chthonius

rDNA, ftsZ, dnaA, gatB, fbpA and coxA) confirms the
topology of wApol and wCisc (wGmin and wCsco not
included) (Fig. 4b). Our analysis shows the same top-
ology for wApol sequences from the two draft genomes
(K5 and K3) as well as sequences of wApol K5 amplified
by PCR, confirming that this topology is not an artifact
of draft missassembly. In addition, to verify the accuracy
of the Wolbachia presence in Geogarypus minor, the
coxA gene was sequenced from another specimen (III-
J5) derived from an independent DNA extraction, and
PCR amplification and the sequences were identical to
another specimen III-T3 (accession number MT273088).
The Wolbachia from Cordylochernes scorpioides had
been previously studied using a set of genes not rou-
tinely sequenced for Wolbachia evolutionary studies
(groEL, fabK, nuoG, NADH dehydrogenase I subunit F,
aspS, gltA, coxA, ftsZ, wsp, orpB, nuoD, isocitrate de-
hydrogenase gene, TPR domain-containing protein gene)
[47]. We performed a multi-locus phylogeny based on
these 13 genes, including wCsco and sequences isolated
from available complete or draft genomes of Wolbachia,
as well as those from the wApol produced draft ge-
nomes. The observed phylogeny shows that wCsco and
wApol cluster together to form a separate clade, a
closely related sister group to supergroup C, as observed
with the phylogeny based on only two markers (Fig. 4a).
The two pseudoscorpions contain closely related Wolba-
chia strains, with 89.3% identity among these 13 genetic
markers (Figure S1).
Two complete phylogenomic analyses were performed:
one including 17 Wolbachia genomes representing 6 dif-
ferent supergroups and one including 38 Wolbachia ge-
nomes
representing
7
different
supergroups
and
including additional draft genome sequences. Three
hundred twenty single-copy orthologues were identified
among the 17 Wolbachia genomes, while 166 were iden-
tified among the 38 Wolbachia genomes. The Maximum
Likelihood phylogeny based on the reduced matrix (17
genomes, 320 orthologues, 89,847 amino-acid sites)
(Fig. 5a) and the one based on the larger matrix (38 Wol-
bachia,
167
orthologues,
40,488
amino-acid
sites)
(Fig. 5b) indicates the wApol group does not cluster with
any other Wolbachia group, suggesting it evolved from
an independent separate speciation event. We created
supplementary phylogenies based on 16S rRNA and ftsZ
and have included numerous Wolbachia species to be
sure that wApol and wCsco are not grouped with
previously described Wolbachia supergroups (Figure
S2 and S3).
Based
upon
the
phylogenomics
analyses,
wApol
(supergroup S) is closely related to supergroup C (sym-
bionts within the filarial nematodes Onchocerca spp. and
Dirofilaria immitis) and supergroup F (including both
filarial and arthropods symbionts).
Discussion
Diversity of Wolbachia in pseudoscorpions
This study highlights diversity of Wolbachia harboured
by pseudoscorpions. The studied specimens harbouring
distinct
Wolbachia
represent
different
families,
not
closely related, within pseudoscorpions. The small num-
ber of pseudoscorpion species studied (3 among 3300
described species) represent only small snapshot of the
diversity within this group (3 families among 27 de-
scribed), suggesting that the heterogeneity of Wolbachia
among pseudoscorpion species may likely be an under-
estimate. The species Geogarypus minor, a representative
of the Geogarypidae family and the species Chthonius
ischnocheles, a representative of the Chthoniidae family,
contain Wolbachia closely related to each other and re-
lated to supergroup H, as represented by termite Wolba-
chia. The species Atemnus politus, as a representative of
the Atemnidae family, contains Wolbachia closely re-
lated to the Wolbachia from the previously described
pseudoscorpion Cordylochernes scorpioides and forms a
clade as a sister group to supergroup C (infecting exclu-
sively filarial nematodes) and supergroup F (infecting
filarial nematodes and arthropods). Within the evolu-
tionary history of pseudoscorpions, at least two events of
horizontal transfers of Wolbachia infection have appa-
rantly occurred. More detailed, biodiversity analysis of
this group will be required to fully detail the evolution-
ary dynamics of their Wolbachia.
New supergroup S
The Wolbachia harboured by Atemnus politus (wApol)
and Cordylochernes scorpioides (wCsco) form a clade di-
vergent from those Wolbachia supergroups previously
described (Figure S2 and S3). The analysis of the wApol
draft genome using phylogenomic analysis (Fig. 5), or
ANI value (Fig. 2) point out a divergent Wolbachia
supergroup. It is important to distinguish the notion of
“supergroup” from the notion of “species” (which re-
mains problematic for bacteria [48]). The “supergroup”
naming only describes the different evolutionary lineages
(or clades) of Wolbachia, and their limits remain arbi-
trary (as far as it being a monophyletic group).
In the past, two Wolbachia supergroups had been des-
ignated and then revised based on further phylogenetic
analysis. Supergoup G had been described as a clade of
Wolbachia from spider Diaea species based on wsp
marker analysis [49]. However, it was later demonstrated
that the analysis based upon this marker sequence led to
an incorrect conclusion due to recombination events be-
tween Wolbachia from supergroups A and B [26]. In the
case of supergroup R, four genes (ftsZ, coxA, groEL, and
16S) were analyzed to study Wolbachia from cave spi-
ders (Telema spp.) [25]. From among these four genes,
only
the
groEL
marker
gave
a
different
topology,
Lefoulon et al. BMC Microbiology          (2020) 20:188

excluding these Wolbachia from supergroup A. Upon
reanalysis, the differing topology conclusion appears to
be due to a G + C composition bias of the groEL gene,
causing an incorrect phylogenetic analysis when based
on nucleotide sequences [27]. Being aware of these, we
created supplementary phylogenies based on 16S rRNA
and ftsZ and have included numerous Wolbachia species
to be sure that wApol and wCsco are not grouped with
previously described Wolbachia supergroups (Figure S2
and S3).
To ensure that the draft genomes of wApol did not
create an artificial clade, we further sequenced PCR
amplificons from six previously studied marker genes
from an independent specimen from the same set of

samples as K5 and verified that the data provided the
same
topology.
Based
upon
this
confirmation,
we
propose that Wolbachia from Atemnus politus and Cor-
dylochernes scorpioides constitute representatives of a
new supergroup. To avoid any confusion, we propose
not to reuse the previous supergroup R [27] designation
and have assigned Wolbachia from the pseudoscorpion
Atemnus politus and Cordylochernes scorpioides to a
novel supergroup S.
wApol draft genomes and limitation of de novo assembly
based on the enrichment method
Two draft genomes, wApol K3 (1,404,177 bp long) and
wApol K5 (1,445,964 bp long) were produced, as repre-
sentatives of supergroup S. These represent an average
size for a Wolbachia genome from arthropods with the
smallest complete Wolbachia genome being the sym-
biont from Trichogramma pretiosum (wTpre) which is 1,
133,809 bp long [50] and the largest being the symbiont
from Folsomia candida (wFol) which is 1,801,626 bp
long [11]. The genomes of Wolbachia from filarial nem-
atodes are smaller, between 957,990 bp and 1,080,084 bp
[44, 51]. However, the two wApol draft genomes are
fragmented, being in 200 contigs and 373 contigs, re-
spectively. Relatively few PacBio reads were obtained
due to limited material. Despite an efficient probe
hybridization enrichment, the low DNA input required
pooling of barcoded samples. Based upon BUSCO, as-
sessment of genome assembly indicates that the draft ge-
nomes wApol are probably incomplete. Despite its
average size, the percentage of missing single-copy
orthologs conserved among proteobacteria and wApol
(or missing BUSCOs) (around 22% for K3 and 22.6% for
K5) is close to the percentage observed for smaller ge-
nomes as wOo (22.6%; 957,990 bp), wOv (23.1; 960,618
bp) or wPpe (21.7%; 975,127 bp). Further, the frequency
of transposable elements (Group II intron-associated
genes, mobile elements and IS) varies between the two
drafts and lower than usually observed for Wolbachia
from arthropods (Table S3). In addition, the long repeti-
tive elements in a genome can limit the efficiency of de
novo assembly following hybridization capture protocols,
as shown with the de novo assembly of wAlbB (Wolba-
chia from Aedes albopictus), which contains a large
numbers of long repetitive Group II intron-associated
genes [36].
Since the first observation in Wolbachia from Culex
pipiens, the presence of WO bacteriophage in Wolbachia
has been well documented [52–55]. Not all Wolbachia
genomes have intact prophage regions; only vestiges of
prophage DNA were detected in Wolbachia genomes in-
fecting nematodes belonging to D or L supergoups [15,
44, 51]. In the two wApol draft genomes, we identified
several coding sequences annoted as phage-like proteins,
such as structural phage proteins (tail, portal phage, cap-
sid genes) (Table S4). Although, the fragmented nature
of the draft genomes limits interpretation, wApol has
clearly been associated with WO bacteriophage, unlike
supergroup C Wolbachia in which no structural phage
proteins are found (Table S4) [44]. In addition, the pres-
ence of a prophage region appears to be a limitation for
de novo genome assembly using the Wolbachia genome
enrichment method, perhaps due to missing probes
based upon the original design or the repetitive pattern
of this region, a similar observation to that of the wAlbB
genome assembly, which also failed to assemble the WO
region [36].
Rare presence of biotin pathway in Wolbachia
Although it is difficult to conclude about the absence of
a particular gene because the wApol draft genomes are
likely incomplete, our study highlights the biotin path-
way as being more complete in wApol than in numerous
studied Wolbachia. Until recently, only wCle (Wolbachia
from bedbug Cimex lectularius) contains a complete
pathway for biotin (vitamin B7) [56]. More recently, a
complete pathway for biotin was identified in wNfla and
wNleu (supergroup A) [57], as well as in wLug and wStri
(supergroup B) [58]. Interestingly, wCle provisions biotin
(but not thiamin), which significantly contributes to the
fitness of host bedbug [56]. In planthoppers, wLug and
wStri Wolbachia appear to increase the fecundity of
their hosts, which may be related to a beneficial effect of
Wolbachia-synthesized biotin and riboflavin [58]. It is
tempting to speculate that this pathway in wApol may
also be important in the association between Wolbachia
and its pseudoscorpion hosts. From this analysis, we also
identified the complete biotin pathway for Wolbachia
from the isopod Armadillidium vulgare wVulC genome.
The presence of the biotin operon among the Wolbachia
appears rare, but when present, its physical organization
appears conserved among them (Fig. 3). Phylogenetic
analysis of the biotin gene cluster supports the sugges-
tion that the biotin operons were acquired by lateral
transfer from endosymbiotic bacteria, such as Cardi-
nium species, as previously suggested [57, 58]. The lack
of congruence between the phylogeny of the biotin
operons and Wolbachia phylogeny suggests multiple in-
dependent transfers of the operon within Wolbachia
evolutionary history.
Conclusion
Our results emphasize the diversity of Wolbachia among
the pseudoscorpion family. We identified infection with
two different groups of Wolbachia, suggesting their in-
dependent evolutionary inheritance, likely via host-
switching. Horizontal transmission of Wolbachia among
insects has been previously documented [31, 59, 60] but
Lefoulon et al. BMC Microbiology          (2020) 20:188 
Page 10 of 15
this is the first time that a group of pseudoscorpions has
been similarly analyzed. The Wolbachia symbiont from
Atemnus politus, wApol is divergent from previous de-
scribed supergroups and we propose a novel clade com-
posed of wApol and wCsco, named supergroup S. The
multi-locus phylogenies and phylogenomics indicate that
the supergroup S is closely related to the supergroup F
(which contains Wolbachia symbionts of arthropods and
filarial nematodes) and supergroup C (comprised exclu-
sively Wolbachia of filarial nematodes).
We produced two draft genomes of wApol, one of 200
contigs (1,404,177 bp; K3) and the second of 373 contigs
(1,445,964 bp; K5) using target enrichment capture. The
genome sequences remain incomplete due to the low in-
put of DNA, limiting the PacBio long read sequencing
and due to the presence of large repetitive motifs and
prophage region(s), previously demonstrated to interfere
with complete genome assembly based on the Wolba-
chia genome capture enrichment.
Interestingly, the annotation of the wApol draft gen-
ome contains the biotin pathway, as opposed to its lack
in most of other Wolbachia, while speculative, it might
be suggested that wApol may provision biotin to their
pseudoscorpion hosts, similar to wCle in its bedbug host
or wStri and wLug in planthoppers. The nature of the
pseudoscorpion-Wolbachia
biology
emphasizes
the
amazing complexity and evolutionary trajectories of
these ubiquitous symbionts and provides the background
for future comparative studies.
Methods
Source of material, DNA extraction and characterization
Specimens were caught in the field using classical soil
microfauna recovery methods using a Berlese–Tullgren
funnel
[49,
61].
The
specimens
were
collected
at
Montpellier in 2017 (43°37′52.0″N 3°52′04.6″E).
DNA
from
specimens
was
extracted
using
the
Monarch® Genomic DNA Purification Kit following the
recommended protocol for extraction from tissues (New
England Biolabs (NEB), USA) with overnight incubation
at 56 °C with proteinase K. The quality of the extraction
was verified by a PCR amplification of the host COI
gene (Table S6). A total of 20 sequences were deposited
in the GenBank Data Library: MN923050-MN923069
(Table S7).
Detection and molecular characterization of Wolbachia
symbionts
The determination of Wolbachia infection in popula-
tions was determined by a series of individual specific
PCRs (Table S1). The presence of Wolbachia was ini-
tially screened using PCR amplification of the Wolbachia
surface protein (wsp) gene. The presence of Wolbachia
was further confirmed using PCR amplification of the
gatB gene for all specimens which tested positive for wsp
amplification or for those giving dubious results, as well
as a randomly selected set of specimens which were
negative for wsp amplification.
The molecular characterization of Wolbachia was de-
termined by PCR amplification of six genes (16S rDNA
gene, dnaA, coxA, fbpA, gatB and ftsZ) as described in
Lefoulon et al. [14] (Table S6). For some specimens,
nested PCR amplification was necessary to obtain suffi-
cient PCR product. A total of 14 sequences were depos-
ited
in
the
GenBank
Data
Library:
MN931247
to
MN931248, MN931689 to MN931700 and MT273088
(Table S8).
Next-generation sequencing of Atemnus politus
Atemnus politus specimens (K5 and K3) were collected
from the same location, but at different times within the
same year (respectively 5 April and 22 February 2017).
The extracted DNAs were low (around 350 ng total
based on Nanodrop™quantification Thermo Scientific,
USA)) and fragmented (average size around 6000 bp). In
order to attain an amount of DNA necessary for the en-
richment method, the DNA of the different specimens
was individually barcoded and processed simultaneously,
using SeqCap® barcoded adaptors (Roche NimbleGen,
USA) (Table 1). Samples were not pooled to avoid
concerns of potential Wolbachia strain differences. Four
different libraries preparations were processed: one Illu-
mina and one PacBio library using DNA enrichment and
Illumina and PacBio libraries without enrichment, to
determine enrichment efficiency (Table 1). The enrich-
ment method has been described by Lefoulon et al. [36]
and it is based on the use of biotinylated probes to cap-
ture
Wolbachia
DNA
(probes
designed
by
Roche
NimbleGen).
For PacBio sequencing (Pacific Biosciences, USA), the
Large Enriched Fragment Targeted Sequencing (LEFT-
SEQ) method, as previously described, was utilized [36]
without the DNA fragmentation step. The PacBio library
without enrichment was produced using the SMRTbell®
Express Template Prep Kit 2.0 for Low DNA input,
using the barcoded Overhang Adapter Kit- 8B (PacBio).
The enriched PacBio library was sequenced using 2
SMRT cells with the PacBio RS II system and the library
without enrichment used 1 SMRT cell, all on the PacBio
Sequel I system.
For Illumina sequencing, a modified protocol was per-
formed, which eliminated the last steps designed for the
PacBio library protocol (end repair, ligation of PacBio
adaptor and purification) and in which DNA was frag-
mented using NEBNext® Ultra™II FS DNA Library Prep
Kit (NEB) at 20 °C for 30 min, resulting in DNA frag-
ments with an average size of 350 bp. We used 100 ng of
DNA per sample for each capture and used SeqCap
Lefoulon et al. BMC Microbiology          (2020) 20:188

barcoded adaptors (Roche Nimblegen) to process simul-
taneous multiple samples. The Illumina library without
enrichment was produced using the NEBNext® Ultra™II
FS DNA Library Prep Kit following the manufacturer’s
recommendations (NEB). The enriched Illumina library
was sequenced on three independent Ilumina MiSeq
runs: one mate-pair 150 bp read and two mate-pair 300
bp reads. The unenriched Illumina library was se-
quenced with one, single-end, 150 bp NextSeq run. All
sequencing was performed at NEB.
De novo assembly pipeline
Illumina reads were filtered by quality and “cleaned”
using the wrapper Trim Galore! (https://www.bioinfor
matics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/), and then
merged with PEAR [62]. PacBio circular consensus se-
quences (CCS) were generated using SMRT® pipe RS_
ReadsOfInsert Protocol (PacBio) with a minimum 3 full
passes and minimum predicted accuracy superior at 90.
The adaptors were removed by trimming off the first
and last 65 bp of the reads, any reads smaller than 20 bp,
or reads containing residual adaptor sequences (potential
chimeric reads) using seqkt (github.com/lh3/seqtk) (ana-
lyses were performed with an in-house shell script).
A first hybrid de novo assembly was done using Unicy-
cler [63]. The potential contigs belonging to Wolbachia
were detected by nucleotide similarity using blastn [40]
and selected (similarity superior at 80%, bitscore super-
ior at 50). The Illumina reads were mapped against this
contig selection using Bowtie2 (with the very sensitive
settings) [64] and the PacBio reads using ngmlr (with
the PacBio preset settings) [65].
A second hybrid de novo assembly was performed
using Unicycler with this new selection of reads. Selec-
tion of Wolbachia contigs was performed using blastn a
second time (similarity superior at 80%, bitscore superior
at 50) and then verified manually. Assembly statistics
were calculated using QUAST [41].
Comparative genomic analyses and annotation of wApol
The comparative genomic analyses described below
included analyses of 10 available complete genomes of
Wolbachia and 4 draft genomes (Table S8): wMel,
Wolbachia from Drosophila melanogaster (NC_002978),
wCau, Wolbachia from Carposina sasakii (CP041215)
and
wNfla,

lidium vulgare (ALWU00000000) for supergroup B;
wPpe,
Wolbachia

for
supergroup L (NZ_MJMG01000000); wCle, Wolbachia
from
Cimex

for
supergroup
F
(NZ_
AP013028); wFol, Wolbachia from Folsomia candida for
supergroup E (NZ_CP015510); wBm, Wolbachia from
Brugia malayi (NC_006833) for supergroup D; wOv
Wolbachia from Onchocerca volvulus (NZ_HG810405)
and wOo, Wolbachia from Onchocerca ochengi (NC_
018267) from supergroup C.
The Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) between the
wApol draft genomes and available complete genomes of
Wolbachia was performed using the ANI Calculator
[45]. The completeness of the draft genome was studied
using BUSCO v3 [43]. BUSCO estimates the complete-
ness of genomes analyzing gene content and comparing
to selection of near-universal single-copy orthologue
genes (here, 221 genes in common among proteobac-
teria (proteobacteria_odb9)).
The processed drafts were analyzed using RAST pipe-
line [42]. Transposable elements were identified: inser-
tion sequences (ISs) using ISSAGA [66] and mobile
element and group II introns using RAST pipeline. The
phage-like proteins were identified using the RAST
pipeline. KEGG Orthology (KO) assignment were gener-
ated using KAAS (KEGG Automatic Annotation Server
[67].
KAAS
assigned
orthologue
genes
by
blast
comparison against KEGG genes database using BBH
(bi-directional best hit) method. The same assignment
analysis was performed for the wApol draft genome, the
set of 14 complete or draft genomes and 1 supplemen-
tary draft genome: wNleu, Wolbachia from Nomada
eucophthalma (LYUV00000000). The assigned KOs were
ordered in 165 different KEGG pathways (Table S5). For
the biotin operon, the amino-acid sequences were identi-
fied with the KAAS assignments of wApol and other
studied Wolbachia genomes and the complete operons
were identified using tblastn and then aligned. The nu-
cleotide sequences were aligned using MAFFT [46],
concatenated using Seaview [68] and a phylogenetic ana-
lysis was performed with Maximum Likelihood inference
inference using IQ-TREE [39].
Multi-locus phylogeny and Phylogenomics
Two multi-locus phylogenies were performed. The first
phylogeny was based on six markers (16S rDNA, dnaA,
ftsZ, coxA, fbpA and gatB), classically used for Wolba-
chia phylogeny [14, 69]. The produced sequences were
analyzed with available sequences extracted from 49
Wolbachia complete or draft genomes and the addition
of sequences from Wolbachia from Zootermopsis angu-
sticollis and Zootermopsis nevadensis (Table S8). A
supplementary analysis was based on 13 markers (groEL,
fabK, nuoG, NADH dehydrogenase I subunit F, aspS,
gltA, coxA, ftsZ, wsp, orpB, nuoD, isocitrate dehydrogen-
ase gene, TPR domain-containing protein gene) which
Lefoulon et al. BMC Microbiology          (2020) 20:188

includes less Wolbachia strains (because these markers
were rarely used for phylogenetic analyses) but included
the only Wolbachia known to infect pseudoscorpions,
Wolbachia from the
pseudoscorpion Cordylochernes
scorpioides [34, 47]. This analysis included 14 complete
genomes in addition to the wApol draft genome and
wCsco
Wolbachia
from
Cordylochernes
scorpioides
(Table S8).
For phylogenomic analyses, single-copy orthologue
genes among a selection of Wolbachia genomes were
identified using Orthofinder [70]. Two types of phyloge-
nomics studies were performed: one included only 15
complete genomes and one included 36 complete or
draft genomes (Table S8). Differences in completeness
of draft genomes can be variable and have a negative ef-
fect on the robustness of the analyses, and thus the two
separate analyses were performed.
The orthologue sequence alignments were generated
by MAFFT [46]. For the multi-locus phylogenies, a
supermatrix of these six alignments was generated using
Seaview [68], and for phylogenomics, the supermatrix
was produced by Orthofinder (implemented as function-
ality). For the later, the poorly aligned positions of the
produced orthologue genes alignments were eliminated
using Gblocks [71]. The phylogenetic analyses were
performed with Maximum Likelihood inference using
IQ-TREE [39]. The most appropriate model of evolution
was evaluated by Modelfinder [72] (implemented as
functionality of IQ-TREE). The robustness of each node
was evaluated by a bootstrap test (1000 replicates). The
phylogenetic trees were edited by FigTree (https://
github.com/rambaut/figtree/)
and
Inkscape
(https://
inkscape.org/).
