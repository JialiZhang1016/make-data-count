Abstract
Floods caused by atmospheric rivers and wildfires fanned by Santa Ana winds are common occurrences in California with 
devastating societal impacts. In this work, we show that winter weather variability in California, including the occurrence 
of extreme and impactful events, is linked to four atmospheric circulation regimes over the North Pacific Ocean previously 
named and identified as the “NP4 modes”. These modes come in and out of phase with each other during the season, result-
ing in distinct weather patterns that recur throughout the historical record. Some phase combinations favor atmospheric 
river landfalls and extreme daily or multi-day precipitation, while other phase combinations favor anomalously hot weather 
and drying Santa Ana wind conditions over Southern California. This historical perspective of atmospheric circulation and 
impacts over 70 years reveals that weather patterns are changing in a way that enhances wildfire hazard in California, while 
the frequency of weather patterns linked to historical floods is not diminishing. These changes highlight the rising hazards 
of cascading weather extremes in California’s present and future.
1  Introduction
Extreme winter weather variability in California is largely 
driven by the interplay between onshore landfalling atmos-
pheric rivers and offshore downslope winds that bring des-
iccating desert conditions often associated with coastal 
heat and sometimes spreading wildfire. Atmospheric rivers 
(ARs) are narrow filaments of concentrated atmospheric 
water vapor that can bring extreme orographically-enhanced 
precipitation during fall and winter. While critical for Cali-
fornia’s water resources, ARs are also the major cause of 
historical riverine floods (Ralph et al. 2006, 2011; Cor-
ringham et al. 2019). Downslope Santa Ana winds (SAWs) 
are characteristically hot, dry, offshore winds that bring fire 
weather to coastal and inland Southern California (Abat-
zoglou et al. 2021). SAWs are linked with Southern Cali-
fornia’s most destructive wildfires (Westerling et al. 2004; 
Moritz et al. 2010; Kolden and Abatzoglou 2018; Gershunov 
et al. 2021). Typically, the SAW season begins in fall and 
peaks in December (Guzman Morales et al. 2016). The tim-
ing of offshore winds relative to ARs is an important factor 
for hazardous wildfires in California, where the risk of a 
destructive wildfire is enhanced if a strong offshore wind 
event such as a SAW—or their northern California coun-
terpart the Diablo wind (Abatzoglou et al. 2021)—occurs 
before the first fall or winter rains when fuel moisture is 
at its climatological minimum. ARs and downslope winds 
are driven by certain recurring weather patterns over and 
offshore of western North America that favor onshore or 
offshore flow over California, respectively (e.g. Ralph et al. 
2004; Neiman et al 2008; Guirguis et al. 2018; Hughes and 
Hall 2010; Abatzoglou et al. 2013; Guzman Morales et al. 
2016). Both flow regimes have important implications for 
California’s land and water resources and pose hazards to 
life and property.

Previous studies have demonstrated the importance 
of certain atmospheric circulation patterns in driving AR 
landfalls over California and western North America. AR 
landfalls are often associated with a ridge situated over/near 
Alaska (~ 160°W) with a trough to the southeast and a strong 
pressure gradient that channels marine moisture toward the 
coast (e.g. Weaver 1962; Strobin and Reynolds 1995; Ralph 
et al. 2004; Neiman et al 2008; Guirguis et al. 2018, 2019, 
2020a). The position, strength, and orientation of these cir-
culation features relative to coastal topography modulate the 
landfall location as well as the amount and spatial distribu-
tion of moisture transport and precipitation (Neiman et al. 
2008; Mundhenk et al. 2016; Swales et al. 2016; Hecht and 
Cordeira 2017; Hu et al.. 2017; Guirguis et al. 2019). ARs 
have also been linked to extratropical cyclones and closed 
low pressure systems (Oakley et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2019).
SAWs are associated with anomalous surface high pres-
sure centered over the interior Great Basin driving anticy-
clonic flow through complex terrain bringing strong, dry 
easterly/northeasterly downslope winds to Southern Califor-
nia (Hughes and Hall 2010; Abatzoglou et al. 2013; Guzman 
Morales et al. 2016). These winds warm by adiabatic com-
pression as air flows from above the elevated Great Basin, 
ascends over the 3000 m high Transverse and Peninsular 
Ranges or is funneled through mountain passes and ulti-
mately descends down to sea level. This warming leads to 
coastal heat waves in the fall, winter and spring (Gershunov 
et al. 2021). The associated hot, dry, and windy conditions 
during periods of low fuel moisture in fire-prone ecosys-
tems creates substantial fire hazard in wildland and adjacent 
communities. Harmful health impacts associated with SAW-
driven heat waves (Schwarz et al. 2020) and wildfire smoke 
(Aguilera et al. 2020, 2021) have also been reported. While 
all SAWs warm adiabatically, they do not always produce 
heat waves at the coast. Hot and cold SAWs result from dis-
tinctly different synoptic dynamics and Great Basin land sur-
face conditions (Gershunov et al. 2021). All SAWs involve 
a surface high pressure over the northeastern Great Basin, 
which develops in association with a blocking high aloft in 
the case of hot SAWs and with Rossby wave breaking in the 
wake of transient cold frontal cyclones in the case of cold 
SAWs; the latter are also associated with anomalous posi-
tive snow cover in the Great Basin (Gershunov et al. 2021). 
Southern California wildfires are preferentially spread by hot 
SAWs (Gershunov et al. 2021).
Typically, the interplay between ARs, SAWs, extreme 
precipitation, and wildfires is thought of as a situation 
where one extreme (ARs) is the remedy or prevention of 
the other extreme (wildfires). However, when ARs occur 
following wildfires, they can cause deadly and damaging 
post-fire debris flows or flash flooding over burn scars 
if short-duration, high intensity rainfall occurs (Oakley 
et al. 2017, 2018), compounding the original impacts of 
wildfire. Here, we show that ARs and SAWs are more 
closely linked than previously discovered through interact-
ing synoptic-scale atmospheric circulation regimes. Spe-
cifically, we demonstrate how four key circulation regimes 
over the North Pacific Ocean (“North Pacific Modes” or 
“NP4 modes”), identified and described in previous work 
(Guirguis et al. 2020a, hereinafter GGR’20), interact on 
daily timescales to produce recurring, regionally-impor-
tant weather patterns responsible for impactful weather in 
California and along the West Coast. These four circula-
tion regimes (shown in Fig. 1a) are known as the Baja-
Pacific (BP), Alaskan-Pacific (AP) Canadian-Pacific (CP), 
and Offshore-California (OC) modes. The NP4 modes 
share characteristics with established, well-known tele-
connections identified in previous work. For example, the 
Alaskan-Pacific and Canadian-Pacific modes are related to 
the well-known East Pacific Oscillation (EPO) and Pacific 
North American (PNA) Pattern, respectively (GGR’20), 
which were first identified in Barnston and Livezey (1987). 
Other studies aiming to identify circulation regimes over 
this region have found similar patterns (e.g. Straus et al. 
2007; Amini and Strauss 2019; Gibson et al. 2020).
The NP4 modes represent four winter teleconnections 
identified by the preferred position of atmospheric ridges 
and troughs over the North Pacific Ocean and along the 
West Coast. As these modes fluctuate, they can shift in- or 
out-of-phase with each other on a given day, and season-
ally they exhibit a strong tendency to persist in one phase 
over the other (GGR’20). The joint phase combination 
of the NP4 modes has been shown to strongly modulate 
coastal water vapor transport, AR landfalls, and Califor-
nia precipitation, and has been linked to historical floods 
(GGR’20). In this study, we extend the relevance of the 
NP4 mode interactions to other types of extreme weather 
events and their consequences, including SAWs and his-
torical wildfires, and show how these interactions produce 
distinct weather patterns that recur throughout the his-
torical record. We focus mostly on the interplay between 
ARs and SAWs (and associated floods and wildfires), but 
also discuss heat waves, cold extremes, and snowpack 
accumulation.
We first classify and describe the dominant, recurring 
weather patterns impacting California and the western US 
during the extended winter season (Nov–Feb; Sect. 3). 
We then identify those weather patterns associated with 
ARs, extreme precipitation, and historical floods (Sect. 4) 
and those associated with Santa Ana winds and wildfires 
(Sect. 5). In Sect. 6, we diagnose and explain observed 
trends in weather pattern frequency and discuss the impli-
cations for wildfire hazard and water resources. Finally, we 
provide a summary and discuss the implications for resource 
and emergency management, subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) 
forecasting, and climate change (Sect. 7).

2  Data and methods
2.1  Time period of study
Our time period of study spans 1949–2021. However, 
some variables have shorter records due to data availabil-
ity. The season of focus is extended winter (November-
February; hereafter winter) to coincide with the NP4 data-
set (described in Sect. 2.8), and which is also the part of 
the season most active with respect to both AR activity 
and SAW activity in California (Gershunov et al. 2017, 
and Guzman-Morales and Gershunov 2019, respectively). 
We note the focus on extended winter omits many of the 
most destructive SAW events occurring in the early fall. 
However, winter SAWs do pose substantial fire hazard 
when they occur before the first seasonal rain or during 
drought years. For example, the Thomas Fire, fanned by 
successive SAWs, burned through most of December of 
2017 and into January 2018 to become (for a time) the 
biggest wildfire in California history.

the positive phase as in GGR’20). The color scale gives the temporal 
correlation (r) between each teleconnection pattern and the standard-
ized Z500 anomalies at each grid cell (b) locations where more than 
50% of Z500 variance is explained by one of the NP4 modes using

joint NP4 modes using multiple linear regression. Figures (a, c) are 
adapted from GGR’20

2.2  Atmospheric variables
Daily 500 mb geopotential height (Z500) and wind 
fields for the period spanning Nov–Feb 1949–2021 are 
from NCEP/NCAR 2.5° global reanalysis (Kalnay et al. 
1996). Daily anomalies were calculated relative to the 
annual/semiannual seasonal cycle fit using least squares 
regression.
2.3  Atmospheric river detection and AR intensity 
scale
The SIO-R1 catalog of Gershunov et al. (2017) is used 
to identify landfalling ARs along the coast of western 
North America. The detection method uses threshold cri-
teria for 6-hourly integrated water vapor (IWV > 15 mm) 
and integrated vapor transport (IVT > 250 kg ­m−1 ­s−1) to 
identify elongated objects of high moisture content that 
intersect the coast. The AR scale of Ralph et al. (2019) is 
used to categorize the magnitude of storms. This 5-scale 
classification is based on IVT magnitude and duration 
where the scale 1–5 describes ARs as weak, moderate, 
strong, extreme, and exceptional, respectively. AR scales 
1–2 are mostly beneficial providing needed precipitation 
without damage, whereas AR scales 4–5 are mostly haz-
ardous with peak IVT in the range of 750 to more than 
1250 kg ­m−1 ­s−1. Flood damages in the western U.S. 
increase exponentially with the AR scale (Corringham 
et al. 2019). The SIO-RI AR catalog is available at https://​
wecli​ma.​ucsd.​edu/​data-​produ​cts/.
2.4  Santa Ana winds
Historical SAW events are identified using the daily Santa 
Ana Winds Regional Index (SAWRI) of Guzman Morales 
et al. 2016. This data product is based on 65 years of hourly 
data from the dynamically downscaled CaRD10 dataset 
(Kanamitsu and Kanamaru 2007) and validated against sta-
tion observations. This study uses the updated daily version 
of Guzman-Morales and Gershunov (2019). The SAWRI 
methodology identifies SAWs at each grid cell if certain 
surface wind conditions are met (wind speeds exceeding the 
local 75th percentile with a northerly to easterly direction). 
Then, a regional SAW index is provided by averaging local 
SAW conditions over a region of concurrent northeasterly 
strong winds that expands from the leeside of the transversal 
and peninsular mountain ranges to the low-elevation coastal 
region of Southern California. The SAWRI dataset is avail-
able at https://​wecli​ma.​ucsd.​edu/​data-​produ​cts/. In this study 
we define moderate (extreme) SAWs as those exceeding the 
50th ­(90th) percentile in the SAWRI record.
2.5  Historical temperature and precipitation
Daily precipitation and maximum temperature (Tmax) data 
are from Livneh et al. (2013, 2015), which is a gridded 
data product available at a 1/16° spatial resolution over the 
period 1950–2015 (available at https://​clima​tedat​aguide.​
ucar.​edu/​clima​te-​data). The source data are from approxi-
mately 20,000 stations in the Global Historical Climatology 
Network (GHCN). Extreme precipitation is defined as daily 
accumulation above the 95th percentile. Heat waves (cold 
extremes) are defined following Gershunov and Guirguis 
(2012) as daily temperatures persisting for at least one day 
above the 95th (below the 5th) percentile after removing the 
seasonal cycle.
2.6  Sierra Nevada snowpack
We use monthly snow water equivalent data from a single 
snow course in the Northern Sierra Nevada. Specifically, we 
selected Donner Summit (39.3° N, − 120.3° W, elevation 
2100 m, station ID 20K10) from the Natural Resources Con-
servation Service (https://​wcc.​sc.​egov.​usda.​gov/​nwcc/​rgrpt?​
report=​snowc​ourse​&​state=​CA). This location sits at the 
intersection of three key headwater regions (Yuba, Truckee, 
and American Rivers) involved in managing California and 
Nevada water resources. The Donner Summit snow course 
has a long (1913–2021) and complete record.
2.7  Wildfire
Wildfire information is from the California Fire Protection's 
Fire and Resource Assessment Program (FRAP) fire perim-
eters database (https://​frap.​fire.​ca.​gov/​frap-​proje​cts/​fire-​
perim​eters/). We focus on fire start dates for historical wild-
fires with burn sizes exceeding 1000 acres in the Southern 
California (SoCal) counties of Santa Barbara, Ventura, Los 
Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and San Diego. 
Our sample includes 76 wildfires spanning 1949–2018, with 
most occurring in November (n = 40) or December (n = 21). 
As mentioned above, most wildfires in California occur in 
October, which is outside of our extended winter focus sea-
son. However, the wildfire season can and does extend into 
winter during drought years or when delayed rains extend 
dry vegetation into the peak of SAW season.
2.8  North Pacific atmospheric circulation regimes
We use daily amplitudes of four North Pacific atmospheric 
circulation regimes (NP4 modes), which were identified 
and shown to be essential drivers of vapor transport and 
AR activity along the coast of western North America by 
Guirguis et al. (2018, hereinafter GGR’18) and GGR’20. 
These four modes are named according to their geographic 
1733

centers of action: Baja-Pacific (BP), Alaskan-Pacific (AP), 
Canadian-Pacific (CP), and Offshore-California (OC) 
modes. The NP4 modes were identified using rotated Empir-
ical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis applied to Z500 
anomaly fields over a large domain spanning the northern 
Pacific Ocean and western North America. While the NP4 
modes are not the most important in terms of field variance 
(i.e., they correspond to higher-order rotated principal com-
ponents), they were found to be the most important modes 
for coastal IVT, AR landfalls, and extreme precipitation in 
California (GGR’18, GGR’20). The EOF loading patterns 
(maps) associated with the positive phase of each mode are 
shown in Fig. 1a. The portion of the domain where these 
modes are most influential is shown in Fig. 1b, c. Specifi-
cally, Fig. 1b shows the locations where one of the four 
modes is by itself responsible for more than 50% of the Z500 
variance. Figure 1c shows the collective influence of the 
four modes, where we see that together these modes explain 
25–90% variance in the portion of the domain most relevant 
for west coast weather. The NP4 dataset used in this study 
is described in Guirguis et al. (2020b) and is available at 
https://​doi.​org/​10.​6075/​J0154​FJJ.
2.9  Weather regime classification
Daily weather regimes are classified based on the joint phase 
combination of the NP4 modes. As the NP4 modes oscillate 
over the North Pacific, their daily interactions determine the 
position and strength of ridges and troughs along the coast 
of western North America. Unique NP4 phase combinations 
result in distinct weather patterns that drive extreme weather 
in California (GGR’18 GGR’20). On a given day, each of the 
four NP4 modes can be positive or negative, which yields 16 
possible phase combinations, and 16 corresponding weather 
regimes (introduced and described in Sect. 3).
We use the terminology “weather pattern” and “weather 
regime” somewhat interchangeably. “Weather pattern” is taken 
to mean the Z500 anomaly field itself while “weather regime” 
refers to the classification of that pattern. A catalog of historical 
weather regimes observed over 1949–2017 is developed as an 
accompaniment to this publication (Guirguis et al. 2022) and is 
available from the UC San Diego Library Digital Collections at 
https://​doi.​org/​10.​6075/​J0891​61B
3  Winter weather patterns impacting 
the West Coast
Figure 2 shows Z500 anomaly patterns associated with the 
sixteen different phase combinations of the NP4 modes, 
which are used to define winter weather regimes (WR) 
impacting the West Coast. We first provide examples of how 
the NP4 modes interact to create distinct weather patterns 
(Sect. 3.1) and then provide an overview of circulation char-
acteristics and impacts associated with each weather regime 
(Sect. 3.2).
3.1  How the NP4 modes interact to produce distinct 
weather patterns
Examples of how the NP4 modes interact to produce distinct 
weather patterns are provided in Figs. 3 and 4 for 2016–2017 
(a wet year) and 2020–2021 (a dry year), respectively (e.g. 
Abatzoglou et al. 2017, https://​wrcc.​dri.​edu/​wwdt/).
Figure  3 shows the daily NP4 amplitudes (Fig.  3a) 
and daily interactions (Fig. 3b) for water year 2016–2017 
(WY2017). We highlight three events (December 7–16, 
January 3–11, and February 1–8) when the NP4 modes 
exhibited the same joint phase configuration (labeled E1, 
E2, and E3; Fig. 3). Specifically, during these three events 
the BP mode was positive (which favors a ridge over Baja 
California, c.f. Fig. 1a), the AP mode was negative (favor-
ing high pressure over Alaska), and the OC and CP modes 
were positive (favoring low pressure over western Canada 
and offshore from California, respectively). This mode con-
figuration results in the atmospheric circulation and IVT pat-
terns shown in Fig. 3c, d, respectively. This type of pattern 
(classified as WR10, see Fig. 2) is associated with strong 
onshore flow, AR landfalls, and wet conditions over Cen-
tral and Southern California with heavy precipitation over 
the Sierra Nevada. In this example, the February 1–8 event 
highlights the Oroville Dam crisis (Vahedifard et al. 2017) 
that resulted in the evacuation of over 180,000 people due 
to spillway damage from extreme runoff during intense and 
prolonged AR precipitation with high snow levels causing 
rain-on-snow. These three events also produced flooding on 
the leeside of the Sierra Nevada (Henn et al. 2020; Sterle 
et al. 2019).
The second example is for WY 2021 (Fig. 4). Here we 
highlight three different events (November 1–4, Novem-
ber 27-December 8, and January 9–17) sharing a common 
NP4 phase combination. For these events (labeled E4–E6), 
the BP and AP modes were positive (favoring a ridge over 
Baja California and a trough over Alaska, respectively, c.f. 
Fig. 1a) and the CP and OC modes were negative (favoring 
high pressure over western Canada and offshore California, 
respectively). This combination results in the atmospheric 
circulation (Fig. 4c) and IVT patterns (Fig. 4d), featuring 
anomalous onshore flow over British Columbia/Pacific 
Northwest and offshore flow over Southern California. This 
pattern of circulation (classified as WR5, see Fig. 2) is asso-
ciated with ARs in the northern latitudes (Pacific Northwest/
British Columbia) and SAW conditions over Southern Cali-
fornia. The two longer events (E5 and E6) prompted Red 
Flag Warnings in Southern California along with large-scale 
public safety power shutoffs initiated by electric companies

to prevent accidental ignitions by utility equipment (Murphy 
2021; Chediak and Sullivan 2021).
Within a weather regime class, defined by the joint NP4 
phase, the mode amplitudes can vary from nearly zero to 
very extreme. These amplitude differences cause variabil-
ity in the orientation and strength of influential circulation 
anomaly features, which directly affects the location and 
magnitude of associated impacts. It follows that the impacts 
associated with each weather regime are considered in a 
probabilistic sense to account for this variability.
3.2  Impacts and circulation characteristics 
associated with each weather regime
Impacts associated with each weather regime are shown in 
Fig. 5 for AR landfall probabilities (a), precipitation anoma-
lies (b), probability of extreme precipitation (c), and per-
cent of total historical precipitation (d). Additional impacts 
are shown in Fig. 6 for SAW probabilities (a), temperature 
anomalies (b), heat wave probabilities (c), and cold extreme 
probabilities (d). The specific NP4 phase combination asso-
ciated with each weather regime is shown in Figure S1 and 
is also displayed as highlighted text in the lower left of each 
map in Fig. 2. For all weather regimes shown in Fig. 2, the 
salient ridge/trough features are well represented by the 
vast majority of days within each weather regime class. For 
example, Figure S2 shows the percent agreement among 
days within each sample in the sign of the Z500 anomaly, 
which reaches 94–100% for ridge/trough positions at the 
point of maximum overlap.
Weather regimes 1–6 feature a strong ridge positioned 
over/offshore western North America (Fig.  2), creat-
ing atmospheric blocking conditions that produce dry 
weather over much of the western US, especially California 
(Fig. 5b–d). Offshore flow occurs over Southern California 
along the eastern boundary of the ridge, bringing elevated 
chances of SAW conditions (Fig. 6a). Four of these pat-
terns (WR1, WR4, WR5 and WR6) favor warm tempera-
tures, with an elevated chance of heat wave occurrence, 
whereas two patterns (WR2&WR3) bring cold conditions 
(Fig. 6b–d). These warm and cold flavors of SAWs are con-
sistent with Gershunov et al. (2021). In the northern lati-
tudes, WR 2–6 result in enhanced onshore flow along the 
northern/northwestern boundary of the ridge, bringing ele-
vated AR probabilities for British Columbia and the Pacific 
Northwest (Fig. 5a).

1735
Winter wet–dry weather patterns driving atmospheric rivers and Santa Ana winds provide evidence…

Weather regimes 7–12 bring wetter conditions to the 
western US coast (Fig. 5) due to the position of an offshore 
trough that enhances transport of oceanic moisture over 
land (Fig. 2). Weather regimes 7–8 feature a trough posi-
tioned near the Pacific Northwest coastline. The location 
of this trough is favorable to precipitation and AR landfalls 
over Oregon and Washington and into Northern California. 
Weather regimes 9–10 feature a trough offshore California, 
which brings precipitation and AR landfalls over Central and 
Northern California. For weather regimes 11–12, the trough 
is further equatorward, favoring a more southerly AR track 
with wet conditions centered over Southern California and 
penetrating into the interior Southwest.
Weather regimes 15–16 bring anomalous onshore flow 
over Baja California (Fig. 2), with wet conditions into the 
Sonoran Desert region (Fig. 5). Concurrently, these weather 
patterns bring strong easterly/northeasterly flow to Northern 
California/Pacific Northwest along the eastern boundary of 
a ridge posited over Alaska or British Columbia. Previous 
work has noted the link between ARs over Baja and inland 
penetration of moisture into the Desert Southwest (Rutz and 
Steenburgh 2012; Neiman et al. 2013; Hughes et al. 2014; 
Rutz et al. 2014, Rutz et al. 2021; Swales et al. 2016; Gers-
hunov et al. 2017).
4  Atmospheric rivers, extreme precipitation, 
and California water resources
The weather regimes responsible for most of California’s 
total and extreme precipitation are WR9-12 (Fig. 5c, d). 
WR9 is characterized by a deep and expansive trough cen-
tered over the Gulf of Alaska, with a ridge positioned over 
Southern California that helps to channel moisture towards 
Central and Northern California (Fig. 2). This weather 
pattern elevates AR probability threefold along the coast

Daily amplitudes of each mode are shown in (a). These modes can be 
in- or out-of-phase with each other on a given day, resulting in differ-
ent phase combinations (b). Three events are identified (E1–E3) when 
the joint phase combination was the same: The Alaskan-Pacific mode 
was negative and the other three modes were positive. Composites of 
Z500 and IVT for these three events are shown in (c, d), respectively. 
The box in (c) shows the region where the NP4 modes are most influ-
ential and where the circulation is expected to be largely modulated

from Central California to the Pacific Northwest (Fig. 5a) 
and brings a high probability of extreme precipitation 
(Fig. 5c). In Central and Northern California, by contrib-
uting upwards of 30% of annual precipitation, WR9 is the 
most important source of precipitation (Fig. 5d). WR10 is 
also vital for California water resources (Fig. 5d) and is 
an important driver of AR landfalls (Fig. 5a) and extreme 
precipitation (Fig. 5c). It is similar to WR9 in the position 
of the high and low pressure centers along the West Coast 
(Fig. 2). However, WR10 is characterized by a ridge over 
Alaska (negative phase of the Alaska-Pacific Mode) and 
a positively tilted trough that extends towards the tropics.
WR12 is similar to WR10, except it lacks the ridge 
over Southern California, which is an important distinc-
tion as its absence allows the trough to expand equator-
ward (Fig. 2) bringing more AR activity and precipitation 
to Southern California (Fig. 5). WR11 is also impact-
ful for Southern California, bringing a high probability 
of extreme precipitation when it occurs (Fig. 5c), but it 
accounts for a smaller proportion of total SoCal precipi-
tation (Fig. 5d) due to the lower frequency of occurrence 
(i.e., WR11 is more transitory and is observed on 2% of 
days compared to 9% for WR12).
Figure 7 summarizes just how critical these weather 
patterns are to California precipitation extremes and water 
resources. Collectively, while they account for only 25% of 
November-February days, they account for up to 72% of 
total precipitation and up to 80% of extreme precipitation 
for some locations in California (Fig. 7a, b). Using the AR 
intensity scale of Ralph et al. (2019), we find that WR9 and 
WR10 are the primary synoptic weather patterns for the 
most intense and destructive ARs (AR scale 4 & 5, Fig. 7c). 
WR9 and WR10 collectively account for approximately 50% 
of AR category 4 storms and more than 80% of AR category 
5 storms impacting California. Median flood damages asso-
ciated with AR category 4 and 5 events are on the order 
of $20 million and $260 million, respectively (Corringham 
et al. 2019).
Previous work has shown how the presence or absence 
of one-to-three intense storms can make-or-break a water 
year (Dettinger et al. 2011) or terminate a drought (Dettinger 
2013), or prevent the onset of a megadrought (Hatchett

et al. 2016). Our findings suggest that these make-or-break 
storms most likely carry synoptic signatures similar to WR9-
12. These few but large storms are important in building 
the Sierra Nevada snowpack that later melts and provides 
beneficial warm season water resources to meet human 
and ecological demands. Figure 8 shows the relationship 
between the seasonal frequency of WR9–12 and interannual 
snowpack variability in the Northern Sierra Nevada, which 
demonstrates a very strong relationship between the number 
of days in a season that WR 9–12 were present and snow 
water equivalent (SWE) at Donner Summit on March 1. 
The relationship is strong (p < 0.001, r = 0.61) even though 
important details including precipitation itself or snowmelt 
events are not considered. This analysis used only one in-situ

Sample size is important for comparing (c, d) where some weather 
regimes bring high probabilities of extreme precipitation but are less

location and a stronger relationship could emerge using a 
more robust SWE dataset.
4.1  Historic California floods
We selected eight flood events to investigate from a weather 
regime perspective. These historic events were selected 
because they have achieved notoriety for the amount of 
destruction they caused. These are the floods of Decem-
ber 1955, December 1964, January 1969, February 1986, 
January 1995, December/January 1996–97, February 2017, 
and February 2019.
Figure 9 shows the IVT magnitude during AR landfalls 
at different latitudes along the coast during Nov-Feb for 
the eight seasons when these floods occurred, classified by 
weather regime. For California latitudes (32.3–42º N) we 
see that the most intense ARs, including the historic floods 
(labeled F1–F8), are associated with WR9 and WR10 (See 
also Fig. 5). Often, the historic floods follow on the tails of 
one or more ARs, which prime the soil moisture, ground-
water, and streamflow conditions for subsequent flooding

Winter wet–dry weather patterns driving atmospheric rivers and Santa Ana winds provide evidence…

(Albano et al. 2020). Evidence of “AR Families”, as defined 
by Fish et al. (2019), whereby successive AR landfalls occur 
at the same location, are also seen (e.g. repeated ARs hit-
ting California during 1996–97 and 2016–17 classified as 
WR9/10). Such “AR Families” impacting California have 
been linked to certain semi-stationary atmospheric circula-
tion patterns over the North Pacific (Fish et al. 2019), which 
are similar in their ridge/trough positions to WR9-12.
Figure 10 shows Z500 anomalies on the peak day of 
each event along with the weather regime classification, 
where we see that all peak days are classified as either 
WR9 or WR10. These patterns favor very strong vapor 
transport over California (Fig. 11). While the patterns are 
similar, there are distinctions in the position of the ridge 
located over/near Alaska and the position/orientation of 
the trough relative to the coast. The positioning of these 
synoptic features modulates the location of the AR track 
as it intersects the coast, which is critical from a local 
impacts perspective (e.g. note the latitudinal differences 
in the AR landfall location in Fig. 11). While there are 
slight variations in the synoptic signatures, the weather 
patterns represent a recurring type of atmospheric circula-
tion linked to extreme precipitation in California, which is 
consistent with many studies in the literature investigating 
these or other extreme AR events (e.g. Weaver 1962; Estes 
1994; Baker and Estes 1994; Strobin and Reynolds 1995; 
Ralph et al. 2004; Neiman et al. 2008; Guirguis et al. 2018, 
2019, 2020a; Hatchett et al. 2020), including hypothetical 
cases (Porter 2011).

5  Santa Ana winds and fire weather
We next investigate the role of the sixteen weather pat-
terns in driving the opposite regional weather phenomena: 
Santa Ana winds and wildfire. Wildfires in California are of 
increasing concern as recent years have brought extremely 
destructive and widespread wildfires with devastating loss of 
life and property and long periods of unhealthy air quality. 
The largest Southern California wildfires are typically asso-
ciated with anomalously hot temperatures, dry vegetation, 
and persistent Santa Ana winds. Here we discuss the types 
of weather patterns most conducive to wildfire in California 
during winter.
Weather regimes 1–6 all support offshore flow over 
Southern California (Fig. 2) and SAW probabilities in the 
range of 39–65%, or 20–100% above average (Fig. 6a). 
These six patterns are also anomalously dry for California 
generally (Fig. 5), although WR6 can produce AR impacts 
in Northern California (Fig. 5a) in cases when the offshore 
trough (Fig. 2) moves closer to shore.
Two of these patterns are associated with cold SAWs 
(WR2&3), and the rest are hot SAW patterns with elevated 
chances of a heat wave (Fig. 6). Hot SAWs are associated 
with a ridge centered over the Great Basin, while cold SAWs 
feature a trough over the interior Southwest and a positively 
tilted offshore ridge that brings northeasterly flow to coastal 
California (Figure S3). The synoptic signatures associated 
with hot and cold flavors of SAWs are consistent with recent 
findings (Gershunov et al. 2021).
Figure 12 shows the weather regime distribution for 
start dates of the largest Southern California wildfires. 
As expected, the weather regimes associated with SAWs 
(WR1-6) are those responsible for most (78%) large 
wildfire starts, and the hot SAW patterns are responsible 
for more than twice as many starts (58%) as cold SAWs 
(24%). Gershunov et al. (2021) found hot SAWs to be 
responsible for the largest wildfire acreages burned in 
Southern California, partly because hot SAWs tend to last 
longer and their high temperatures support enhanced dry-
ing of vegetation and lower relative humidity, but also 
because cold SAWs tend to be preceded by precipitation. 
Weather regime 5 is associated with the largest number 
of wildfire ignitions (30%), which results from strong off-
shore flow (Fig. 2) favoring fire weather: hot, dry, SAW 
conditions (Figs. 5, 6). The WR5 pattern also occurs more 
frequently than other hot, dry, SAW patterns (i.e. WR5 
occurs on 10% of days compared to 3% for each WR1 and 
WR4). Composites of atmospheric circulation associated 
with Southern California wildfire start days classified as 
WR1-6 (Figure S4) highlight the similarity between syn-
optic circulation on specific wildfire start days and the 
defined weather regimes (Fig. 2).
5.1  The California Thomas Fire of 2017
In addition to hot, dry, and windy conditions needed for a 
wildfire to grow, the largest wildfires are associated with the 
persistence of these conditions over a period of time with-
out rain. The Thomas Fire of 2017–2018 burned for over a 
month, igniting December 4 before being fully contained 
on January 12. Figure 13a shows atmospheric river activity 
during 2017–2018, highlighting ARs hitting land between 
22.5 and 57.7° N. We see that AR landfalls occurred along 
the West Coast in November of 2017 (seen as green circles 
mostly north of 35°), but these storms primarily impacted 
the Pacific Northwest and Northern California, while South-
ern and Central California remained dry. December is typi-
cally the most active month for ARs in Northern Califor-
nia and the second most active month for ARs in Southern 
California (Gershunov et al. 2017). However, in December

2017 no ARs made landfall in the State. Following igni-
tions by downed power lines on and around December 4, 
the dominant weather patterns were those associated with 
hot, dry, SAW conditions. From Fig. 13b, the most common 
weather regimes during December 4–January 12 were WR1 
(11 days), WR4 (6 days), WR5 (6 days), and WR6 (5 days). 
Containment of the fire was aided by a weak atmospheric 
river on January 9–10 (classified as WR8, Fig. 13a). While 
this storm finally brought rainfall, it also brought tragedy 
as it included short-duration, high intensity precipitation

associated with cold frontal passage that triggered fatal 
post-fire debris flows in the coastal community of Montecito 
(Oakley et al. 2018).
6  Observed trends in weather regime 
frequency and implications for California 
water resources and fire hazard
In the past decade, California has endured two extreme and 
persistent droughts, ongoing extreme heat, and eight of the 
ten largest wildfires in over a century of records (Krishna-
kumar and Kannan 2020). Here, we investigate if and how 
winter weather patterns are changing across the western US, 
and how these changes might affect winter weather variabil-
ity and extremes in California. Figure 14 gives the seasonal 
frequency of each weather regime over the historical record, 
along with statistically significant (p < 0.05) increasing (red) 
and decreasing (blue) trends. The weather patterns found to 
be increasing in frequency are WR1, WR4, WR5, and WR7. 
While WR7 is not linked to extreme California weather in 
our analysis, the other three weather regimes (1, 4 &5) are 
major contributors to historical wildfires (Figs. 12 and 13b) 
and are associated with heat waves in California and the 
western US (Fig. 6c). The combined seasonal frequency of 
these three weather regimes is provided in Fig. 15b, which 
shows a strong increase in the frequency of these impactful 
weather patterns (slope = 0.21% per year, p < 0.001). During 
the 2021 water year, which was the second driest statewide 
in 125 years (California Department of Water Resources 
2021), these weather patterns accounted for 41% of days in 
the season. This anomaly was exceeded only once previously 
in 2015, also a critically dry year in California and Nevada 
(Sterle et al. 2019; Western Regional Climate Center 2021).

Along with increasing fire hazard due to the rising fre-
quency of hot, dry, SAW patterns, we also find evidence of 
decreasing frequency of weather patterns associated with 
cold SAWs (WR3; see also Gershunov et al. 2021) and pre-
cipitation in the Southwest (WR11, WR12, and WR14). 
Figure 15a shows the combined frequency of the patterns 
associated with southwest precipitation (WR11, WR12, and 
WR14, slope = − 0.18% per year, p < 0.001). These are all 
associated with a deep trough over and offshore from west-
ern North America (Fig. 2) with moisture transport along a 
southern track bringing precipitation to Southern California 
and the Desert Southwest (Fig. 5). These weather regimes 
also tend to be colder (Fig. 6b, d), therefore this decreasing 
trend could mean less precipitation in general, but also less

cold precipitation which has implications for snow accu-
mulation and storage. We find no long-term trends for the 
weather patterns associated with the strongest ARs and the 
most destructive California floods (WR9 and WR10). This 
suggests that atmospheric circulation is changing to favor 
fire weather at the expense of precipitation in Southern Cali-
fornia, but the hazard of extreme precipitation and flooding 
caused by the strongest ARs is not diminishing.
The observed trends in the frequency of certain weather 
patterns is related to the rising frequency of ridging over 
land along the west coast. Specifically, we observe a posi-
tive trend in the Baja-Pacific mode, which makes ridging 
over Baja California more likely, and a negative trend in the 
Canadian-Pacific mode, which corresponds to an increase 
in ridging over the Pacific Northwest and western Canada 
(Figs. S5 and 1a). These geospatial differences in trends of 
height anomalies over land relative to those over the Pacific 
Ocean favor atmospheric blocking conditions associated 
with dry weather in California. Persistent ridging has been 
implicated in recent California droughts (e.g., Swain et al. 
2014; Bond et al. 2015; Gibson et al. 2020a).
7  Discussion
In this study, we demonstrate how four modes of atmos-
pheric circulation over the North Pacific Ocean interact to 
produce distinct weather patterns that recur throughout the 
historical record. These recurring weather patterns drive AR 
landfalls, extreme precipitation, historic floods, Santa Ana 
winds, wildfires, and temperature extremes during Califor-
nia winters. Relationships between the driving NP4 modes 
and climate-scale teleconnections like ENSO have already 
been discovered (GGR’20) and the results presented here 
provide a method for exploring important linkages between 
seasonal- and weather-scale processes that could help to 
improve predictability of extreme events. This methodol-
ogy can easily be applied to dynamical weather forecast 
models to investigate the predictability of extreme weather 
impacts at S2S lead times. Predicting the phase of one or 
more NP4 modes, using dynamical, statistical, or hybrid 
methods, would be highly useful for situational awareness 
regarding the likelihood of extreme weather events. Dynami-
cal models have been shown capable of producing skillful 
forecasts of large-scale circulation features at lead times of 
2.5 weeks (e.g. Ferranti et al. 2018, 2019) to several weeks 
(Gibson et al. 2020b). Additional lead time and higher confi-
dence in long-lead forecasts can be translated by forecasters 
into improved impact-based decision support (Uccellini and 
Hoeve 2019) to partner agencies and used to provide earlier 
warning to the public before extreme events (e.g., Lambrecht 
et al. 2019, 2021).
An important outcome of this work is the generation 
of a catalog of daily weather patterns spanning 73-years 
(Guirguis et al. 2022), which can be used for monitoring 
and predictability studies. Our weather regime classification 
has been shown to be skillful at representing important cir-
culation features associated with impactful events, including 
destructive floods and Southern California wildfires. Using 
this approach, we find that the seasonal frequency of weather 
patterns associated with wildfire is increasing while other 
patterns that bring precipitation to southern California and 
the Desert Southwest are decreasing in frequency. This is an 
unsettling set of trends, as during 2020 California suffered its 
worst wildfire season on record, causing extensive impacts 
to ecosystems, property, and public health (e.g. Aguilera 
et al. 2020, 2021). The continued dry conditions experienced 
during winter 2020–2021 exacerbated already extreme fire 
hazards throughout California. Significant wildfire activity 
occurred in the Sierra Nevada and northern Coastal Ranges 
during the summer and fall of 2021, however two early-win-
ter precipitation events largely reduced Southern California 
fire hazard and luckily no major fires occurred during the 
SAWs that did occur.
Importantly, while circulation changes appear to be 
reducing the likelihood of some types of precipitation 
events (WR11, WR12, WR14), there is no observed change 
in the weather patterns responsible for the most intense ARs 
and destructive floods (WR9 and WR10). With warming 
due to anthropogenic climate change, these patterns could 
potentially be even more destructive as the atmosphere can 
more effectively transport larger quantities of water vapor 
(Rhoades et al. 2021). This is consistent with recent work 
focused on precipitation regime changes in California using 
climate model projections (Pierce et al. 2013; Polade et al. 
2017; Espinoza et al. 2018; Swain et al. 2018; Gershunov 
et al. 2019), which suggest that future California precipita-
tion will come by way of fewer, more intense storms with 
longer dry spells in between. While the trends detected in 
this study are sensitive to the record length of the observa-
tions, the methodology could be applied to climate model 
projections to evaluate the roles of natural variability ver-
sus climate change in driving the recent changes in weather 
regime frequency.
There are many research questions that could be 
explored using this methodology and data catalog. While 
we provided only a cursory look at the relationships with 
snowpack, the role of different weather patterns in driving 
snow accumulation and depletion throughout the western 
United States, would be valuable knowledge from a water 
resource perspective, particularly as snowpack continues 
to decline (Siirila-Woodburn et al. 2021). In this work, 
we explicitly focused on Southern California’s SAWs 
while recognizing the importance of Diablo winds in 
Northern California. Recent work suggests that Northern 
1746
	
K. Guirguis et al.
1 3
California’s Diablo winds are dynamically related and 
tend to co-occur with SAWs (Gershunov et al. 2021). This 
weather regime approach and catalog would be useful for 
exploring the coordination of California’s downslope wind 
systems in detail.
Further investigation on the timing and transition of dif-
ferent weather patterns could provide insight for S2S predict-
ability. While this analysis focused on the California winter 
season, the methodology could be applied to other seasons 
to study warm season heat waves and/or fire weather, as 
well as to other regions. Improving our understanding of 
the linkages between climate change, seasonal-scale telecon-
nections, and extreme weather will be critical for effective 
emergency planning, resource management, and climate 
change adaptation efforts at local, regional, and state levels.
