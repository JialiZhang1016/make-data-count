ABSTRACT 
Correct determinations of distribution (Ed) and application (EA) efficiencies allow 
adequate estimations of the gross irrigation depth. This study aimed: i) to determine the 
distribution efficiency using the Christiansen uniformity coefficient (CUC) in a sprinkler 
irrigation system under different weather conditions and working pressures; ii) to compare 
the mean, median, and cumulative CUC values; and iii) to evaluate the predictive capacity 
of four EA estimation models.CUC values were determined from 80 assessments, as well 
as the mean, median, and cumulative. The precipitated water depth accumulated in each 
collector was considered for the accumulated CUC. More uniform evaluations were used 
for EA (working pressure of 196 kPa), resulting in 20 samples. Besides being measured, 
EA was estimated by Keller & Bliesner, Playán, Tarjuelo, and Beskow methods. Statistical 
indicators were the root mean square error, mean bias error, Willmott agreement index, 
mean absolute error, and Pearson correlation coefficient.CUC values ranged from 66.51 to 
92.04%, and the accumulated CUC provided an improvement over the isolated 
evaluations. The Beskow model had the best EA estimations in conventional spraying.
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Irrigated agriculture is essential in some regions of 
Brazil for maintaining high crop yields due to the irregular 
precipitation distribution. The conventional sprinkler 
irrigation system is widely used in Brazil (Alves et al., 
2017). However, this system does not operate at its 
maximum efficiency under adverse weather conditions, 
such as high temperature, low air humidity, and high wind 
speed, wasting water, bad fertilizers solubilization, and 
instability in electrical network (Molle et al., 2012; 
Sheikhesmaeili et al., 2016). 
For irrigation management, irrigation efficiency 
(Ei) is determined by application (EA) and distribution 
(Ed) efficiencies and is calculated as the product of these 
two variables. Knowledge of Ei is of paramount 
importance for proper irrigation management because the 
gross water depth to be applied is adjusted from this 
variable (Kifle et al., 2017). 
In sprinkler irrigation systems, part of the water 
depth applied by emitters does not reach the soil surface 
and/or the shoot occupied by crops. This portion of water 
represents evaporation and wind drift (WDEL), which, in 
turn, are expressed as the percentage of the gross applied 
volume lost in a given irrigation event (Andrés & Cuchí, 
2014). The ratio between the water depth that reached the 
irrigation target (collected water depth) and applied water 
depth is defined as application efficiency (EA). WDEL is 
obtained by subtracting EA by the unit value. 
Evaporation losses depend on the relative humidity, 
wind speed, ambient temperature, emitter working 
pressure, emitter installation height fromthe soil surface, 
and droplet diameter. Wind drift, on the other hand, 
depend mainly on wind speed, droplet diameter, and the 
distance traveled by droplets until they reach the shoot of 
crops or soil surface (Maroufpoor et al., 2017). 
The quantification of WDEL is considered of high 
relevancein both environmental and economic aspects. 
However, estimating these losses separately is a rather 
complicated 
task 
due 
to 
the 
difficulties 
of 
the 
methodologies required for their measurements (Beskow et 
al., 2011). Several studies have been conducted in different

regions of the world with the purpose of modeling or 
evaluating some existing models for WDEL estimation in 
sprinkler irrigation systems (Colombo et al., 2015; Faria et 
al., 2012; Stambouli et al., 2013). 
Another factor necessary to be considered in 
sprinkler irrigation systems assessments is the Ed. To 
calculate this, uniformity coefficients need to be used. 
Several methods can be found in the literature, but the 
Christiansen uniformity coefficient is the most widely used 
for conventional sprinkling (Cavero et al., 2016). Ed is 
also influenced by weather conditions and characteristics 
of the irrigation equipment. 
According to Colombo et al. (2015), knowledge of 
the performance of an irrigation system, especially 
regarding the uniformity of distribution of the applied 
water depth, is essential for making decisions that allow 
the rational use of water, energy, and fertilizers. Thus, 
knowing the influence of weather variables is essential to 
predict or estimate irrigation uniformity, and even to 
identify the best time for the operation of a sprinkler 
irrigation system. 
Therefore, this study aimed: i) to determine the 
distribution efficiency using the Christiansen uniformity 
coefficient (CUC) in a sprinkler irrigation system under 
different weather conditions and working pressures; ii) to 
compare the mean, median, and cumulative CUC values; 
and iii) to evaluate the predictive capacity of four 
application efficiencyestimationmodels. 
 
MATERIAL AND METHODS 
Location and characterization of the area 
The study was conducted in an experimental 
irrigation area of the Department of Agricultural 
Engineering of the Federal University of Viçosa, Viçosa, 
MG, Brazil, with geographical coordinates of 20°45′ S and 
42°51′ W, and an altitude of 651 m. The local climate is 
Cwa, according to the Köppen-Geiger classification, i.e., a 
humid subtropical climate with dry winter and hot summer 
(Alvares et al., 2013). 
This study consisted of the evaluation of an 
irrigation system with six midi-sectorial or 360° sprinklers 
with a 4 mm nozzle. Sprinklers were spaced at 11 × 8 m to 
suit the experimental area configuration, supported by a 
1.7 m rod above the soil surface and recommended 
working pressure for system operation of 196.13 kPa. 
Distribution uniformity evaluation 
Collectors were arranged between six sprinklers 
operating 
simultaneously. 
Collectors 
were 
of 
the 
Fabrimar® brand and were installed equidistant at 2 m, 
resulting in 44 collectors (Figure 1). A rod was used to 
suspend the collector at the height of 70 cm from the soil 
surface, following the methodology proposed by Merriam 
& Keller (1978). 
 
 
FIGURE 1. Sketch of the experimental area. 
 
The data on mean air temperature, relative 
humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed were collected 
throughout the testing period using an Irriplus E5000® 
automatic weather station, located 30 m from the 
experimental area. 
Eighty field tests with 60 minute durations were 
performed under different weather conditions (Figure 4) 
from April to July 2017. The reading of weather elements 
was performed every 20 minutes, and their mean was used 
to represent the weather conditions during irrigation. 
Water depth was measured at the end of each test 
on each collector using a 15 mm Fabrimar® graduated 
beaker. The Christiansen uniformity coefficient (CUC) 
(Christiansen, 1942) was used to calculate the uniformity 
of distribution, according to [eq. (1)]. 
CUC = 100 ൬1 −

Where: 
CUC is the Christiansen uniformity coefficient (%); 
N is the number of observations; 
Di is the water depth applied at the i-th point on the 
soil surface (mm), and 
Dm is the mean applied water depth (mm). 
 
The mean and median CUC values were calculated 
after CUC has been determined for each evaluation. 
Cumulative CUC was also determined by summing the 80 
values of water depth measured in each collector. The 
calculation was performed with these cumulative values, 
according to Equation (1). 
The mean, median, and cumulative CUC were 
determined for every ten successive evaluations to verify 
the sensitivity of differences in a few numbers of 
evaluations, resulting ineight replications in a randomized 
block design. These data were analyzed by the Tukey test 
at a 0.05 significance level. 
Evaporation and wind driftevaluation 
Before starting the evaluations, the flow versus 
working pressure curve was determined for the sprinkler 
used in this study (Figure 2A). For this, pressures ranging 
from 78 to 333 kPa were used. Thus, a linear regression 
model was adjusted to predict the flow as a function of 
working pressure.

with 4 mm nozzle) during the study period. Viçosa, MG, Brazil, DEA–UFV, 2017. 
 
Working pressure readings of the six sprinklers 
were taken in all evaluations at the beginning, middle, and 
end of the irrigations. Schrader valves (coarse nozzle) were 
installed in the riser pipe at 5 cm below the sprinkler to 
facilitate working pressure readings. The flow rate and, 
thus, the water depth applied in each evaluation were 
obtained with the mean pressure using the regression 
equation shown in Figure 2A. 
The evaluation of evaporation and wind drift 
(WDEL) or application efficiency (EA) was carried out 
usingtwenty evaluations with working pressures closer to 
196.13 kPa (pressure recommended by the manufacturer). 
This procedure was used to standardize the droplet size, as 
operating pressures of the irrigation system showed high 
variations during the evaluation period (Figure 2B). Thus, 
it was also possible to correlate them better with input 
variables based on weather conditions of prediction models. 
Pressure variation is related to the instability of the 
electrical network and water quality used in irrigation, as it 
had suspended solids. These impurities caused disc filter 
clogging and, consequently, reduced the working pressure 
during the test. Backwash was performed manually at the 
interval of each evaluation. 
The arithmetic means water depth applied by 
sprinklers and the water depths measured in the collectors 
were used to calculate the evaporation andwind drift. Thus, 
WDEL was calculated using [eq.(2)].

Where: 
WDELis the evaporation and wind drift (%),  
Dapplied is the applied water depth (mm), and

However, data processing was based on EA.For this, 
WDEL values were subtracted from 100. 
In addition to measurements, EA was estimated by 
different models as a function of weather conditions in the 
tests. The mathematical models used in the present study 
were proposed by Keller & Bliesner (1990), Playán et al. 
(2005), Tarjuelo et al. (2000), and Beskow et al. (2008), 
represented, respectively, by equations shown in Table 1.

The following statistical indicators were used to 
verify the performance of the models usingthe observed 
values: root mean square error (RMSE), mean bias error 
(MBE), in addition to the parameters recommended by 
Legates & McCabe (1999), Willmott agreement index (d) 
and mean absolute error (MAE). The magnitude of the 
coefficient of determination (R2) and Pearson correlation 
coefficient (r) was used to correlate the measured with 
the estimated data. 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The Christiansen uniformity coefficient (CUC) 
values were increasingly ordered and associated with the 
sprinkler working pressure, ranging from 66.51 to 92.04% 
and 44.1 to 196 kPa, respectively (Figure 3).

The 72 evaluations of the irrigation system through CUC showed results higher than 80%, and one of the main factors 
influencing the distribution uniformity was sprinkler working pressure (Figure 3). In contrast, due to the characteristics of the 
study area and range of weather variation duringthe study, weather elements affected the distribution uniformity with less 
intensity (Figure 4).

instantaneous relative humidity (RHinst) in%, and solar radiation (Rs) in KJ m−2 for 80 evaluations of a conventional sprinkler

The variable CUC had a low Pearson coefficient 
(r), i.e., a weak correlation with all the weather elements. 
The water distribution of an irrigation system mainly 
depends on the spacing, type, size, internal design, and 
working pressure of emitters (Zhu et al., 2015). 
The variation in the uniformity of water distribution 
evaluated at different times, working pressures, and 
weather conditions have been reported in other studies. Li 
et al. (2015) evaluated a sprinkler irrigation system in 
which the working pressure ranged from 200 to 350 kPa 
and found CUC values from 73.27 to 81.11%. Robles et al. 
(2017), on the other hand, studied the effect of wind speed 
on distribution uniformity and found CUC values of 89 
and 67% for low and high wind speed conditions, 
respectively. Justi et al. (2010) evaluated 25 irrigation 
events and found mean and maximum CUC values of 
79.72 and 89.45%, respectively. 
Sheikhesmaeili et al. (2016) suggested being 
acceptable CUC values of at least 80% in sprinkler 
irrigation systems. Most evaluations presented CUC values

above 80% (Figures 3 and 4), but values below 80% can 
be found due to working pressure and wind speed 
variations, as observed in this and other studies. This 
behavior discourages the use of only one evaluation to 
represent the uniformity of water distribution in 
conventional sprinkler irrigation systems. 
A reference value needs to be adopted when an 
irrigation system has several CUC values. This value can 
be used to determine theirrigation efficiency and, 
therefore, provide adequate irrigation management, turning 
the net water depth into gross. The CUCmean of 84.66% 
shown in Figure 5 represents the mean of all evaluations. 
CUCmedian had a value of 86.04%, which is higher than the 
CUCmean. In contrast, the CUCcumulative, which represents 
CUC considering the sum of water depths distributed in 
the area over time, presented a value of 90.64%, which is 
higher than the others are.

Water distribution in the irrigation area varies over 
time, 
significantly 
changing 
its 
uniformity 
when 
considering multiple irrigations. Usually, a point of the 
area to be irrigated may receive water depths equal to, 
lower than or higher than that of the mean at different 
irrigation events because of the random pattern of the 
collected precipitation, which is influenced by some 
weather parameters and/or working pressure.Therefore, the 
same point that received a low irrigation depth and was in 
deficit compared to other areas can receive a water depth 
higher than the mean in the next irrigation event, partially  
or totally supplying the deficit that occurred in the first 
irrigation. Thus, when CUCmean or CUCmedian are adopted, 
it is disregarded that a region that receives different water 
depths may have in time a higher and more representative 
CUC of the area, especially in areas of the semi-arid, 
which receive high and more frequent water depths.

FIGURE 6. Distribution uniformity of an irrigation system at three different times. Evaluation 1 had a CUC value of 84.96%; 
Evaluation 2 presented a CUC of 86.06%; and CUCcumulative presented a value of 90.64% for 80 evaluations. Viçosa, MG, 
Brazil, DEA–UFV, 2017. 
 
Among the various causes that affect the 
distribution uniformity of a sprinkler irrigation system, 
special attention should be given to working pressure and 
wind speed and direction (Li et al., 2015). Variation of 
these factors is undesirable, as they tend to reduce the 
distribution uniformity coefficient. Weather factors are 
dynamic, even choosing less windy times is not a 
guarantee of even distribution. Assuming that wind speed 
and direction vary, it is possible to understand that a 
conventional sprinkler irrigation system operating at 
different times and low irrigation frequency can 
redistribute water in the area to be irrigated, thus 
promotinga better irrigation uniformity over time, as 
shown by the CUCcumulative (Figure 6). 
Water redistribution by irrigation systems occurs in 
different applications or within the same application 
depending on the duration of the irrigation. It would be a 
new way of understanding the dynamics of irrigation and 
CUC use, often underestimated. In this sense, it has 
already been proposed to monitor the uniformity of water 
distribution in the soil profile, as it can redistribute water 
and, thus, present a CUC closer to reality (Rocha et al., 
1999). 
The CUCcumulative values for every ten evaluations 
ranged from 88.50 to 89.39%. On the other hand, the 
CUCmean comprised values from 83.25 to 86.07%, and 
CUCmedian values ranged from 83.91 to 87.51%. Based on 
the mean of the eight groups of evaluations (replications), 
the CUCcumulative was higher than CUCmedian and CUCmean 
(Table 2). CUCmean was the variable that most 
underestimated distribution uniformity.

Means followed by the same lowercase letter for different CUC determinations do not differ from each other by the Tukey test at 0.05 
significance level. 
 
Under practical conditions, conducting eighty 
evaluations to propose a more representative CUC of the 
area becomes unfeasible. Therefore, it was suggested in 
Table 2 to perform at least ten evaluations using the 
CUCcumulative, as CUCmean and CUCmedian underestimate 
distribution 
uniformity, 
besides 
presenting 
higher 
variations between evaluations. 
Application efficiency (EA) was determined, 
ordered in increasing order, and correlated by Pearson’s 
coefficient (r) with weather elements (Figure 7).

(RHinst) in%, and solar radiation (Rs) in KJ m−2 for 20 evaluations of a conventional sprinkler irrigation system. Viçosa, MG, 
Brazil, DEA–UFV, 2017. 
 
The higher the wind speed, the lower the 
application efficiency, thus promoting higher wind drift (r 
= −0.70). The vapor pressure deficit, solar radiation, and 
relative humidity directly correlated with EA, with values 
of −0.63, −0.85, and 0.62, respectively. Thus, these 
weather elements increased evaporation and wind drift 
(Figure 7). Evaporation and wind drift were also reported 
by Cavero et al. (2016) for the day and night periods. The  
positive correlation between weather data with EA is 
paramount to search for models that best fit a particular 
location (Saraiva et al., 2013).

The results show that the Beskow method was the 
most efficient in the estimation of EA, which is evidenced 
by lower values of RMSE, MAE, and MBE, besides higher 
d and r. On the other hand, the other evaluated methods 
presented low performance, with high RMSE and MAE 
values. Beskow et al. (2008), analyzing the Playán and 
Tarjuelo models to estimate EA, worked with a single 
sprinkler operating and several sprinklers operating 
simultaneously, and found unsatisfactory adjustments. 
In addition to statistical indices, the analysis in 
Figure 8 shows the distribution of the measured and 
estimated EA values by each method. Except for the 
Beskow method, all others had unsatisfactory performance 
in relation to the measured values, showing a tendency to 
overestimate them, which is also indicated by the high 
MBE values. The Beskow method presented good 
precision (R2 = 0.803) and accuracy (a = 18.939 and b = 
0.781), but there was a small dispersion of data due to 
systematic and random errors.

Bliesner, Playán, Tarjuelo, and Beskow equations. Viçosa, MG, Brazil, DEA–UFV, 2017. 
 
The Beskow method showed better agreement, 
possibly due to the regional approximation and similarity 
of weather conditions of the present study. This method 
was developed under the conditions of Lavras, MG, Brazil 
(Beskow et al., 2008), and the other models in the United 
States (Keller & Bliesner, 1990) and Spain (Playán et al., 
2005; Tarjuelo et al., 2000). Saraiva et al. (2013) found 
similar results. 
Figure 8 also shows that it is important to draw 
attention to the fact that the valuesestimated by the Keller 
& Bliesner method presented a very small variation. This 
method presented low sensitivity to weather variations, 
which possibly corroborated for this model to present the 
worst performance. 
The 
Keller 
& 
Bliesner 
(1990) 
model 
underestimated evaporation and wind drift and/or 
overestimated application efficiency (Figures 8 and 9). 
Faci et al. (2001) observed similar resultsin working with 
spray-type sprinklers.

equations. Viçosa, MG, Brazil, DEA–UFV, 2017. 
 
As shown in Table 3 and Figures 8 and 9, the used 
models tended to overestimate the observed field data, and 
one of the factors that may be related to this application 
efficiency overestimation is the nozzle size used for 
modelgeneration. The sprinkler nozzle used in the present 
study had 4 mm. According to Beskow et al. (2008), 
smaller nozzles promote higher spraying of dropletsand, 
thus, have a larger area per unit of mass, which may result 
in higher evaporation loss and susceptibility to drift by 
the wind. 
Even finding a model that fits well with field 
conditions, it requires caution when using a model to 
estimate EA of a conventional sprinkler irrigation system. 
It is always important to analyze model limitations, such as 
nozzle diameter, working pressure, and jet slope used to 
generate the predictive model (Beskow et al., 2008). 
Sprinkler height may also favor EA, as the longer the riser 
pipe, the longer the droplet will be exposed to the 
environment (Faci et al., 2001; Playán et al., 2005). 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
The 
distribution 
uniformity 
given 
by 
the 
Christiansen uniformity coefficient had high variation 
during the experimental period (66.51 to 92.04%). The 
highest and lowest CUC for the experimental area was the 
CUCcumulative and CUCmean, respectively. The Beskow 
model was the best alternative for predicting application 
efficiencies. The Keller & Bliesner model is not 
recommended for the study conditions to predict 
application efficiency, as it presented low sensitivity to 
input parameters.
