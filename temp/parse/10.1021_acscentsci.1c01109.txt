ABSTRACT: Carbon−nitrogen bonds are ubiquitous in biologically active compounds, prompting synthetic chemists to design
various methodologies for their preparation. Arguably, the ideal synthetic approach is to be able to directly convert omnipresent C−
H bonds in organic molecules, enabling even late-stage functionalization of complex organic scaﬀolds. While this approach has been
thoroughly investigated for C(sp2)−H bonds, only few examples have been reported for the direct amination of aliphatic C(sp3)−H
bonds. Herein, we report the use of a newly developed ﬂow photoreactor equipped with high intensity chip-on-board LED
technology (144 W optical power) to trigger the regioselective and scalable C(sp3)−H amination via decatungstate photocatalysis.
This high-intensity reactor platform enables simultaneously fast results gathering and scalability in a single device, thus bridging the
gap between academic discovery (mmol scale) and industrial production (>2 kg/day productivity). The photocatalytic
transformation is amenable to the conversion of both activated and nonactivated hydrocarbons, leading to protected hydrazine
products by reaction with azodicarboxylates. We further validated the robustness of our manifold by designing telescoped ﬂow
approaches for the synthesis of pyrazoles, phthalazinones and free amines.
■INTRODUCTION
Carbon−nitrogen bonds are ubiquitous in natural products,
pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials, stimulating the
interest of the synthetic community to develop new amination
protocols.1 Especially C(sp2)−N bonds can be readily formed
by stitching carbon electrophiles (e.g., aryl halides) and various
N-based nucleophiles together using transition metal cata-
lysts,2−5 with one notable example being the Buchwald−
Hartwig amination.6,7
Currently, small molecules with increased sp3 hybridization
are required to reduce the attrition rate in drug discovery and
to explore new chemical space (so-called “escape-from-ﬂatland
strategy”).8,9 C(sp3)−N bonds can be easily forged by
rudimentary nucleophilic substitution on alkyl halides.
However, the direct C(sp2)−H to C−N bond conversion
has attracted signiﬁcant amounts of attention as it improves the
atom eﬃciency of the overall process.10 While thermocatalytic
approaches have proved to be the method of choice for the
functionalization of C(sp2)−H bonds, photocatalysis has
rapidly emerged as a powerful strategy for the selective
activation of C(sp3)−H bonds.11 Two seminal approaches to
establish these coveted C(sp3)−N bonds were independently
reported by Zuo and co-workers12−14 and Kokotos et al.15 The
methods exploited, respectively, a cerium salt16 and phenyl-
glyoxylic acid17 to generate H atom abstractors. These species
are subsequently capable of homolytically cleaving C(sp3)−H
bonds and aﬀord a carbon-centered radical, which is ﬁnally

trapped by an azodicarboxylate to aﬀord the targeted C(sp3)−
N bond.
Given the importance of this transformation and in line with
our mission to bridge the gap between academic discovery and
industrial production through technology,18 we decided to
design a high-productivity platform for photocatalytic C(sp3)−
H amination. To this end, the intended methodology should
be (i) robust and reproducible, (ii) easily scalable, and (iii)
compatible with other chemistries to design telescoped
approaches to access various useful compounds. To realize a
widely applicable C(sp3)−H amination protocol, we selected
direct hydrogen atom transfer (d-HAT) as the activation
strategy and decatungstate as a suitable photocatalyst (Scheme
1A).19,20 Decatungstate enables eﬃcient d-HAT under mild
reaction conditions (i.e., room temperature and low-energy
UV-A light) in both activated and nonactivated organic
compounds.21−26 Moreover, d-HAT typically requires no
additives that might interfere with the transformation.27 As
for scalability and compatibility, we purposely designed a ﬂow
photoreactor equipped with high intensity and dimmable chip-
on-board (COB) LED technology (Figure 1). Since photo-
chemical reaction rates are strongly dependent on the local
light intensity,28 we surmised that the high intensity in
combination with microscale ﬂow reactors should enable the
high productivities (kg/day/unit) required for scale-up in
pharmaceutical settings (Scheme 1B). Hence, this potent
photochemical reactor enabled both fast results gathering and
scalability in a single device, thus bridging the gap between
academic discovery and industrial production (Scheme 1B).
■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Aiming to develop a fast and scalable C(sp3)−H amination
protocol, we commenced with the development of a new
photochemical reactor which provides large amounts of
photonic ﬂux (Signify Eagle Reactor). The reactor consists of
a translucent perﬂuoroalkoxy capillary microreactor (PFA, 750
μm ID, 5 mL volume) and is cooled by a fan and irradiated
with six UV-A 365 nm COBs protected by a quartz exit
window, providing a maximum of 144 W optical power (Figure
1) (see the Supporting Information (SI)). The light sources
are attached to a heat dissipation element containing cooling
ﬁns and a fan, to cool the COBs for an optimized irradiation
eﬃciency.
Using this powerful photochemical reactor, the C(sp3)−H
amination of cyclohexane (1a) with diisopropyl azodicarbox-
ylate (2a) in the presence of 2 mol % TBADT (TBADT:
tetrabutylammonium decatungstate, (Bu4N)4W10O32) could be
realized in only 5 min residence time in an excellent GC yield
of 85% (Table 1, entry 1).19 Notably, lowering the catalyst
loading to 0.2 mol % resulted in a similar yield (Table 1, entry
2), which is beneﬁcial to minimize trace metal impurities and
thus reduce the overall cost of the process. Lowering the
amount of H-donor (1a) from 10 to 5 equiv resulted in a
reduction of the yield (Table 1, entry 3). The amination

Challenges associated with the scale-up of photochemical trans-
formations can be alleviated with suitable reactor technology in
combination with high intensity light sources.

protocol works optimally in a CH3CN/0.1 M HCl (7:1)
solvent mixture (Table 1, entry 2 vs entries 5 and 6). Finally,
control experiments revealed that the C(sp3)−N bond
formation is photocatalytic in nature as no product was
observed in the absence of either photocatalyst or light (Table
1, entries 7 and 8).
With these optimized reaction conditions established, we
sought to evaluate the scope of the photocatalytic C(sp3)−H
amination methodology (Scheme 2). Thus, cyclic alkanes with
ring sizes from 5 to 7 underwent the C−N bond-forming
reaction promptly (3−5, 65−73%), transforming unactivated
alkyl substrates into synthetically valuable hydrazines. It is
worth noting that polyfunctionalization of the hydrocarbon
backbone was never observed. Activated allylic positions were
rapidly converted into the corresponding C−N bond (6, 72%).
Also, eﬃcient α-to-O C−H amination was observed for a
variety of cyclic and noncyclic ethers (7−11, 46−91%) and an
acetal moiety (12, 92%). Similarly, α-to-S and α-to-N C−H
bond functionalization was achieved (13−15, 70−77%), with
excellent selectivity over competitive activation at the α-to-O
position (14). Tertiary C(sp3)−H bonds were selectively
activated over weak, yet polarity-mismatched, α-cyano C-
(sp3)−H bonds (16, 66%).29 Notably, aldehydes could be
readily activated with decatungstate yielding the corresponding
hydrazides in good yields (17−19, 47−81%).30,31 A cyclic
ketone showed exclusive selectivity for functionalization of the
β-position (20, 70%).29 Other dialkyl azodicarboxylates (2b
and 2c) were equally eﬀective as acceptors in this C(sp3)−H
amination protocol, delivering the corresponding Boc (tert-
butoxycarbonyl, 21 and 22, 68−83%) or Cbz (benzylox-
ycarbonyl, 23−25, 69−96%) protected hydrazine derivatives.
To demonstrate the utility of the developed methodology
for the synthesis of N-based heterocycles, we converted the
obtained protected hydrazines to pyrazoles via a telescoped
Knorr pyrazole synthesis (Scheme 3A).32
A diverse set of alkyl-bearing pyrazoles could be obtained in
good overall yields (26−33, 39−75%) simply by merging the
reaction stream exiting the photochemical reactor with a ﬂow
containing diﬀerent 1,3-dicarbonyl derivatives (A−C) in 4 M
HCl in dioxane. It should be further noted that this two-step
ﬂow protocol enables access to pyrazoles bearing unactivated
alkanes, which could not be prepared using our direct
decatungstate-mediated C(sp3)−H azolation.33 In addition,
by adding 2-formylbenzoic acid derivatives (D, E) instead, the
corresponding phthalazinones (34−37, 55−69%) could be
obtained by means of this streamlined ﬂow process (Scheme
3A). Finally, we also demonstrated that the protected
hydrazines can be readily converted to the corresponding
primary amines via hydrogenation (38, 87%) (Scheme 3B).
The scaling of photochemical transformations has long been
perceived as an insurmountable challenge, preventing such
activation modes from being routinely used in the preparation

of complex molecules, such as pharmaceuticals and agro-
chemicals.34−38 Since the kinetics of photochemical trans-
formations are critically dependent on the amount of photons,
the choice of the light source is paramount to scale any
photon-dependent reaction.36,39 Indeed, when varying the light
intensity, an initial linear increase of the yield was observed
with increasing photon ﬂux (Scheme 3C). At high light
intensities (>120 W optical power), the photocatalytic
C(sp3)−H amination reaction becomes ultimately independ-
ent of the photon ﬂux and thus the reaction mixture is
“saturated” with photons. However, the linear regime of the
curve can be extended either by increasing the catalyst loading
or by increasing the ﬂow rate (and thus reducing the
residence/reaction time), which allows to boost the
throughput in the ﬂow reactor. Both aspects are crucial in
our scale-up strategy where we increased the catalyst loading to

2 mol % and reduced the residence/reaction time to only 1
min (see the Supporting Information for more details). This
enabled us to reach 314 mmol/h productivity, amounting to a
2.15 kg/day in a single microreactor of only 11 mL volume
(750 μm ID) (Scheme 3D). It should be noted that these are
quantities that are suﬃcient to even meet the material demand
required for clinical trials.40
■CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, we have developed a fast and scalable
decatungstate-catalyzed C(sp3)−H amination protocol, able
to convert both activated and nonactivated hydrogen donors.
The modularity of our protocol is exempliﬁed by the possibility
to carry out telescoped processes for the synthesis of
(protected) hydrazines, pyrazoles, phthalazinones, and amines.
Key in the successful scale-up of the transformation is the
development of a new photochemical ﬂow reactor with high
intensity LED light source modules. Our results show that
essentially the same reactor, requiring only a minimal
reoptimization of the reaction conditions, is capable of
providing the quantities needed on both the laboratory (i.e.,
∼2 mmol) and process scale (>2 kg/day). We are optimistic
that the results presented herein can inspire others to combine
simultaneously synthetic methodology development and
chemical engineering principles to rapidly transition from
initial discoveries to applications on a process scale.
