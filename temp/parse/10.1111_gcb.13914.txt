Abstract
Tropical rainforests are subject to extensive degradation by commercial selective log-
ging. Despite pervasive changes to forest structure, selectively logged forests repre-
sent vital refugia for global biodiversity. The ability of these forests to buffer
temperature-sensitive species from climate warming will be an important determinant
of their future conservation value, although this topic remains largely unexplored.
Thermal buffering potential is broadly determined by: (i) the difference between the
“macroclimate” (climate at a local scale, m to ha) and the “microclimate” (climate at a
fine-scale, mm to m, that is distinct from the macroclimate); (ii) thermal stability of
microclimates (e.g. variation in daily temperatures); and (iii) the availability of microcli-
mates to organisms. We compared these metrics in undisturbed primary forest and
intensively logged forest on Borneo, using thermal images to capture cool microcli-
mates on the surface of the forest floor, and information from dataloggers placed inside
deadwood, tree holes and leaf litter. Although major differences in forest structure
remained 9–12 years after repeated selective logging, we found that logging activity
had very little effect on thermal buffering, in terms of macroclimate and microclimate
temperatures, and the overall availability of microclimates. For 1°C warming in the
macroclimate, temperature inside deadwood, tree holes and leaf litter warmed slightly
more in primary forest than in logged forest, but the effect amounted to <0.1°C differ-
ence between forest types. We therefore conclude that selectively logged forests are
similar to primary forests in their potential for thermal buffering, and subsequent ability
to retain temperature-sensitive species under climate change. Selectively logged for-
ests can play a crucial role in the long-term maintenance of global biodiversity.

INTRODUCTION
Land-use change is a profound threat to Earth’s terrestrial biodiversity
(Maxwell, Fuller, Brooks, & Watson, 2016; Sala et al., 2000). Most of
this biodiversity is found in tropical regions (Jenkins, Pimm, & Joppa,
2013), where rates of deforestation and forest degradation are among
the highest globally (Hansen et al., 2013). The detrimental impacts of
deforestation on tropical biodiversity are well known (Barlow et al.,
2016; Gibson et al., 2011); however, tropical forest degradation via
commercial selective logging is 20 times more widespread than

ongoing conversion (Asner, Rudel, Aide, Defries, & Emerson, 2009;
Hansen et al., 2008), making it important to understand the value of
these disturbed forests for biodiversity. Selectively logged forests con-
stitute a large and effective refuge for species of conservation concern
that cannot survive in deforested land (Edwards & Laurance, 2013;
Edwards et al., 2011; Gibson et al., 2011). Protecting selectively
logged forests may be a cost effective way to retain tropical biodiver-
sity (Edwards, Tobias, Sheil, Meijaard, & Laurance, 2014), but this is
heavily contingent on the assumption that these forests will maintain
their current conservation value into the future.
Several factors may influence the value of selectively logged for-
ests for biodiversity in the long-term, and a key consideration is the
interaction of multiple drivers of biodiversity loss (Brook, Sodhi, &
Bradshaw, 2008; Mantyka-pringle, Martin, & Rhodes, 2012; Sirami
et al., 2017). The impacts of climate change are particularly impor-
tant, and increasingly so as this century progresses (Chou et al.,
2013; IPCC, 2013; Sala et al., 2000). Novel (non-analogous) climatic
conditions are predicted to appear first in the tropics (Mora et al.,
2013), where many species have narrow thermal limits (Deutsch
et al., 2008; Khaliq, Hof, Prinzinger, B€ohning-Gaese, & Pfenninger,
2014; Tewksbury, Huey, & Deutsch, 2008) and where there is lim-
ited dispersal potential owing to poor dispersal ability of many spe-
cies (Van Houtan, Pimm, Halley, Bierregaard, & Lovejoy, 2007). This
vulnerability of tropical species is compounded by an absence of tar-
get habitats containing analogous climates (Colwell, Brehm, Cardelus,
Gilman, & Longino, 2008), and widespread deforestation creating a
hostile matrix through which dispersal must occur (Brook et al.,
2008; Scriven, Hodgson, McClean, & Hill, 2015). The ability of tropi-
cal species to withstand climate change, and so avoid extinction, is
likely to be highly dependent on their ability to adapt in situ within
existing forest areas. The extent to which species persistence can be
facilitated within selectively logged forests will, therefore, greatly
influence the conservation value of these habitats.
In primary forests and secondary forests re-growing on aban-
doned farmland, previous studies found that organisms—particularly
ectotherms—avoid suboptimal temperatures in the wider “macrocli-
mate” (climate at a spatial scale of m to ha) by moving locally into
“microclimates”: climate at a fine-scale, mm to m, that is distinct
from the macroclimate (Gonzalez del Pliego et al., 2016; Scheffers,
Brett, Diesmos, Williams, & Evans, 2014; Scheffers, Evans, Williams,
& Edwards, 2014). Climate at this fine-scale is more relevant for the
majority of terrestrial biodiversity, which primarily consists of small-
bodied ectotherms (Nadeau, Urban, & Bridle, 2017; Potter, Arthur
Woods, & Pincebourde, 2013; Suggitt et al., 2011). Indeed, the vast
proportion of terrestrial species are small in size, flat in shape, or
thermoregulate via contact with a substrate, and so it is important
to consider microclimates close to, and including, the surfaces on
which these species live (Kaspari, Clay, Lucas, Yanoviak, & Kay,
2015; Scheffers et al., 2017).
The most informative fine-scale temperature data are derived
from point measurements that are highly replicated in both space
and time, and demonstrate that loss of vegetation cover causes local
daytime warming (Ewers & Banks-Leite, 2013; Gonzalez del Pliego
et al., 2016; Hardwick et al., 2015; Senior, Hill, Gonzalez del Pliego,
Goode, & Edwards, 2017). Selective logging affects vegetation by
lowering and thinning the canopy, reducing leaf area index (Ewers
et al., 2015; Hardwick et al., 2015) and the number of vegetation
strata, and creating large forest gaps (Kumar & Shahabuddin, 2005;
Okuda et al., 2003). As such, the understorey of logged forests likely
receives a greater amount of solar radiation, partitioned increasingly
as direct rather than diffuse radiation (Oke, 1987), although these
impacts diminish rapidly as selectively logged forests recover (Asner,
Keller, Rodrigo Pereira, Zweede, & Silva, 2004). The most tangible
impact on the local climate could be an overall increase in the day-
time temperature of logged forests, increasing the necessity for ther-
mal buffering. Simultaneously, the potential for thermal buffering
may be compromised if forest structural changes also influence the
temperature and distribution of cool microclimates, particularly if
their temperature becomes more similar to that of the wider macro-
climate (e.g. Caillon, Suppo, Casas, Arthur Woods, & Pincebourde,
2014), or there are simply fewer cool microclimates available overall.
Conversely, enhanced air-mixing in more open logged forests might
create cooler and less variable microclimates. Previous evidence sug-
gests that the availability of cool “microhabitats” (localized environ-
ments within which cool microclimates are contained; Gonzalez del
Pliego et al., 2016; Scheffers, Brett et al., 2014; Shi, Wen, Paull, &
Guo, 2016) can be reduced (e.g. leaf litter; Saner et al., 2009) or
increased (e.g. deadwood; Carlson, Koerner, Medjibe, White, & Poul-
sen, 2017) by selective logging, implying that forest quality alters
thermal environments.
A key novel question that we address in this paper is whether
vegetation changes following commercial selective logging reduce
the potential for thermal buffering. We focused on cool microcli-
mates in the understorey only (climate at mm to m scale that is
cooler than the macroclimate and located within ~2 m of the forest
floor). Microclimates on the surface of the forest floor were cap-
tured by a thermal camera, while dataloggers were used to capture
microclimates within cool understorey microhabitats: leaf litter, tree
holes and deadwood (Gonzalez del Pliego et al., 2016; Scheffers,
Brett et al., 2014; Scheffers, Evans et al., 2014). We determined
thermal buffering potential according to: (i) the microclimate tem-
perature relative to that of the macroclimate; (ii) the daily variation
in microclimate temperature; and (iii) the availability of microcli-
mates in space. The first two are roughly measures of microclimate
“quality”—they examine how effectively an organism will be buf-
fered from macroclimate warming, assuming it moves into the
microclimate. The third measure captures the likelihood that organ-
isms can locate and move into suitable microclimates, according to
the occurrence, distribution and thermal diversity of microclimates
within the habitat (Caillon et al., 2014; Sears, Raskin, & Angilletta,
2011). We predicted that logged forests would be structurally dis-
tinct from primary forest, and we tested the hypothesis that this
would lead to reduced thermal buffering potential and, subse-
quently,
impaired
ability
of
temperature-sensitive
species
to
respond in situ to excessively high temperatures in the wider
macroclimate.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1
|
Study area
Sampling took place in an extensive area of contiguous forest in
Sabah (Malaysian Borneo; Figure 1a). This area represents over
10,000 km2 of lowland dipterocarp forest, comprising production
forest and areas of undisturbed protected forest (Reynolds, Payne,
Sinun, Mosigil, & Walsh, 2011). In this study, we sampled sites in
forest that had been commercially selectively logged twice (Ulu
Segama-Malua Forest Reserve, 4°57042.8″N, 117°56051.7″E). The
area was first logged from 1987–1991, using tractors and high-lead
extraction techniques to harvest commercial trees (those in the fam-
ily Dipterocarpaceae) with stems >0.6 m diameter at breast height
(D.B.H.), and yielding ~113 m3 of timber per hectare (Edwards,
Magrach, Woodcock et al., 2014; Fisher et al., 2011). Between 2001
and 2007, the area was re-logged and the minimum harvested tree
diameter reduced to >0.4 m D.B.H., yielding an additional 31 m3/ha
of timber (Fisher et al., 2011). Thus, we sampled sites that had been
heavily disturbed about 10 years prior to the study, at which point
67% of the forest had an average density of <10 trees per hectare
with a D.B.H. >40 cm (Reynolds et al., 2011). The area has been
recovering naturally since logging operations ceased. Control sites
were located in undisturbed, protected primary forest (Danum Valley
Conservation Area; 4°57045.2″N, 117°48010.4″E).

Sampling design
We sampled twelve sites, six in twice-logged forest and six in pri-
mary forest, along existing transects (Figure 1b; Edwards et al.,
2011; Edwards, Magrach, Woodcock et al., 2014). Sites were more
than 2 km apart, and at least 100 m from forest edges. Within each
site, we established five plots 50 m in diameter, with plot centres
spaced at 125 m intervals along the transect (Figure 1c; 60 plots in
total). Fieldwork was conducted from April to July 2015, during the
severe El Ni~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event of 2015–2016
(NOAA, 2015) when mean daily temperature was 2.26°C higher and
mean daily rainfall was 2.09 mm lower than the 5-year average
(across April to July for the years 2007 to 2011; data from weather
station at Danum Valley Field Centre).

Forest structure
To quantify the level of disturbance to the forest from selective log-
ging, we used an established methodology for assessing forest struc-
ture in each plot (Hamer et al., 2003; Lucey & Hill, 2012). The
variables we measured were: the stand basal area (m2/ha) of mature
trees (circumference >0.6 m) and saplings (circumference 0.1–0.6 m),
based on the distance to and circumference at breast height of the
two nearest trees and saplings in each of four quadrants centred on
the plot centre (Figure 1d); the coefficient of variation for the basal
area of trees and of saplings; the proportion of mature trees that
were dipterocarps (indicative of mature, complex forest); percentage
canopy cover and visual estimates of percentage vegetation cover at
ground (1.5 m above ground), understorey (15 m above ground) and
canopy (the main stratum of leaf cover >15 m above ground) height.

insect and reptile species. We measured surface temperature within
each plot using an infrared camera (FLIR Systems, model E40).
Macroclimate temperature was defined as the air temperature at
1.5 m above-ground, measured using a whirling hygrometer. Each
site was visited on 2 days, and each plot within the site was sampled
five times each day between 05:00 hr to 14:30 hr. During each sam-
ple of any given plot, the observer stood at the centre of the plot,
took a single hygrometer reading and then, holding the camera at
breast height and pointing 45° downwards (relative to the ground),
took a photo in four orthogonal directions (Scheffers et al., 2017).
Each thermal image comprised 19,200 distinct observations of sur-
face temperature (one per pixel), and covered a surface area of
approximately 1 m2. In total, we recorded 2,400 thermal images (4
images per plot 9 5 repeats 9 2 site visits 9 60 plots).
For all subsequent analyses, a unique data point comprised ther-
mal information from the four photographs taken each time a plot
was sampled: 76,800 observations of surface temperature measure-
ments for each plot (i.e. combining 19,200 observations from the
four photos taken in each orthogonal direction). For details of ther-
mal image data extraction and processing see Supplementary Text
S2. The temperature of cool surface microclimates was defined as
the 5th percentile (i.e. coolest) across all 76,800 pixels. For some
organisms, the efficacy of thermal buffering also depends on the
thermal stability of microclimates (Shi et al., 2016). We calculated
daily variation in surface microclimate temperature as the difference
between the minimum and maximum microclimate temperature, for
each day and for each plot.
To identify spatially explicit patches of warm and cool pixels
(Figure 2) we calculated the Getis–Ord local statistic for each pixel
within the neighbourhood of the nearest eight pixels, using the
function “localG” in the spdep package in R (Bivand & Piras, 2015;
R Core Team, 2017). Pixels with a Z-value of ≥3.886 were defined
as being within warm patches, and those with a Z-value of
≤3.886 within cool patches (Getis & Ord, 1996). Thermal diversity
was defined as the difference between the median temperature of
the warmest warm patch minus the median temperature of the
coolest cool patch (hereafter: “patch temperature range”). The aver-
age surface area of cool patches was calculated as the total num-
ber of pixels within cool patches, multiplied by the surface area of
one pixel (0.516 cm2), and divided by the total number of cool
patches across the four photos. Finally, spatial configuration of cool
patches was quantified using the Aggregation Index: the number of
edges that cool patches share, divided by the maximum number of
edges that they could possibly share (Caillon et al., 2014; He,
DeZonia, & Mladenoff, 2000). Higher values of the Aggregation
Index indicate increased clustering of microclimates in space, which
makes them more difficult for organisms to track (Sears et al.,
2016).

Quantifying microclimates in leaf litter, tree
holes and deadwood
Many ectotherms, such as amphibians, spend some or all of their
time exploiting cool microclimates inside microhabitats, which ther-
mal images are unable to capture. We selected three types of micro-
habitat known to provide cool microclimates (Gonzalez del Pliego
et al., 2016; Scheffers, Brett et al., 2014; Scheffers, Evans et al.,
2014), and placed one temperature datalogger (HOBO pendant data-
logger, Onset, model UA-001-64K or model UA-002-64K) per plot in
each microhabitat type: deadwood (>10 cm stem diameter), tree
holes (>2 cm at widest point of entrance hole, <2 m above the
ground) and leaf litter (1.5 m left of the plot centre). The hygrometer
measurements of macroclimate temperature were not always syn-
chronized with the dataloggers inside microhabitats, hence we addi-
tionally measured macroclimate temperature using a datalogger
suspended 1.5 m above the ground at the centre of each plot,
shielded against direct radiation and precipitation by an inverted
plastic funnel (Scheffers, Brett et al., 2014; Shoo, Storlie, Williams, &
Williams, 2010).
All dataloggers recorded temperature every 20 min for six con-
secutive days, occurring within 1 week of thermal image collection.
For qualitative comparison with thermal images and to lessen the
degree of temporal autocorrelation, microclimate temperatures for
each of the three microhabitats in each plot were calculated as the
median of six daily measures, computed for each two-hour interval
during the same time period as when thermal images were collected
(i.e. 04:40 to 14:40 hr). Our analyses focused on day-time thermal
buffering, but we also ran analogous models for the full 24 hr to

explore night-time thermal buffering (see Supplementary Text S5). In
the main text, we only present data for day-time measurements
because this is most relevant to organisms seeking to avoid extremes
of heat, and because findings were qualitatively similar. Variation in
temperature for microclimates inside microhabitats was defined as
the daily range (95th percentile minus 5th percentile) of raw temper-
atures for each day, in each plot.
To estimate the occurrence of microclimates inside microhabitats,
we measured the volume of leaf litter, tree holes and deadwood
within a 50 9 5 m subplot centred on each plot centre (60 subplots
in total), with the long edge running parallel to the transect. For full
methodological details see Supplementary Text S3. We divided
microhabitat volume by the total area surveyed to generate micro-
habitat volume per m2 forest, for each plot.

Variables analysed
2.6.1
|
Forest structure
We examined the impact of selective logging on forest structure
using
linear
mixed
effects
models
to
compare
nine
structural
response variables between logged and primary forests: stand basal
area of trees and of saplings; the coefficient of variation across indi-
vidual basal areas of trees and of saplings; proportion of trees that
were dipterocarps (binomial data: dipterocarp versus nondiptero-
carp); percentage canopy cover (proportion data) and percentage
vegetation cover at ground, understorey and canopy strata (propor-
tion data). We found that tree stand basal area (m2/ha) was a good
measure
of
changes
in
forest
structure
from
logging
activity
(LR = 8.102, p < .01; Fig. S1a; see Results for full details), hence we
use this variable as a continuous measure of disturbance (henceforth:
forest quality) in all our analyses exploring the thermal buffering
potential of logged and unlogged forests.
2.6.2
|
Macroclimate and microclimate temperature
Macroclimate temperature is the temperature at a relatively coarse
spatial scale, and was captured in this study using both a hygrometer
and suspended datalogger (measuring the same variable but at differ-
ent times). The macroclimate does not affect thermal buffering
potential per se, but it does dictate the overall necessity for thermal
buffering. We modelled hygrometer and datalogger temperature sep-
arately, including forest type (logged or primary forest) and forest
quality as explanatory variables (see Supplementary Text S4).
To assess the impact of selective logging on the ability of micro-
climates to buffer organisms from macroclimate warming, we mod-
elled microclimate temperature against forest quality, forest type and
macroclimate temperature, including an interaction term between
the latter two variables. The slope of the relationship between
microclimate and macroclimate temperature is a measure of the rate
of change. Surface microclimate temperature refers to the 5th per-
centile of surface temperature observations (i.e. coolest) for each
plot, and this was compared against macroclimate temperature as
measured by the hygrometer. Microclimate temperature inside leaf
litter, tree holes and deadwood refers to the two-hourly median
temperature recorded by dataloggers inside microhabitats, and this
was compared against macroclimate temperature as measured by
the suspended datalogger.
To capture the impact of logging on the thermal stability of
microclimates, we modelled microclimate temperature range against
forest type and forest quality. For surface microclimates, the range
was the daily range of microclimate temperatures (the 5th per-
centiles, i.e. coolest surface temperatures). For microclimates inside
microhabitats, the range was the daily range (95th percentile minus
5th percentile) of the raw temperature observations. All models were
run separately for surface, leaf litter, tree hole and deadwood micro-
climates.
2.6.3
|
Microclimate availability
Microclimate occurrence was modelled separately for surface micro-
climates (i.e. the average surface area of cool patches), and those
inside leaf litter, tree holes and deadwood (each quantified by their
average volume per m2 forest). The thermal diversity of surface
microclimates was captured by the temperature range between the
warmest warm patch and the coolest cool patch. The spatial configu-
ration of surface microclimates refers to the Aggregation Index of
cool patches (binomial data: edges shared by cool patches versus
edges not shared by cool patches). For all models, the fixed effects
were forest type (logged or primary forest) and forest quality (i.e.
tree stand basal area).
2.6.4
|
Statistical analyses
All data were analysed using mixed effects models in R (version 3.3.0;
R Core Team, 2017). To account for spatial pseudoreplication, forest
structure models included “site” as a random intercept term, and all
other models included “plot” nested within “site”. Temperature data
were recorded at multiple time points, hence the full models were
visually assessed for evidence of temporal autocorrelation of residuals
(function “acf” in the nlme package; Pinheiro, Bates, DebRoy, & Sarkar,
2017), and a correlation structure for both date and time was incorpo-
rated where necessary (the specific structure was chosen using AIC;
Zuur, 2009). For binomial data (proportion of dipterocarps and surface
microclimate Aggregation Index), we used generalized linear mixed
effects models (GLMMs) with a binomial error distribution, fitted using
the package lme4 (Bates, M€achler, Bolker, & Walker, 2015) and tested
for overdispersion. Diagnostic plots were assessed for all models to
confirm model fit and, where necessary, we modified the variance
structure of the residuals (Zuur, 2009) and transformed variables to
normality. For true proportion data (percentage canopy cover and per-
centage vegetation cover), the transformation used was a modification
of the empirical logit (Warton & Hui, 2011).
For all models, statistical significance was inspected using likeli-
hood ratio tests, dropping each fixed effect in turn and comparing it
to the full model (Zuur, 2009). The significance of main effects

Changes in forest structure after logging

basal area—our measure of forest quality—was 23.4 m2/ha in
logged
forest,
compared
to
39.5 m2/ha
in
primary
forest
(LR = 8.102, p < .01; Fig. S1a). Logged forests thus contained far
fewer large trees than did primary forests. There were also more
large saplings in logged forest (9.55 m2/ha) than in primary forests
(6.77 m2/ha; LR = 4.239, p < .05; Fig. S1b), and trees were less vari-
able in size (LR = 13.038, p < .001; Fig. S1c). There was no differ-
ence between forest types in terms of the variability in size among
saplings (LR = 0.114, p = .736; Fig. S1d).
Changes to forest structure from selective logging were also evi-
dent in the overall amount of vegetation cover. Although there was
no observed difference between logged forest and primary forest in
percentage
vegetation
at
ground
level
(LR = 2.758,
p = .097;
Fig. S1g), the proportion of trees that were dipterocarps (Χ² = 2.42,
p = .12; Fig. S1e) or the percentage canopy cover (LR = 0.874,
p = .35; Fig. S1f), we did find that percentage vegetation cover was
higher in primary forest than in logged forest in both the under-
storey
(primary = 68.2%;
logged = 54.4%;
LR = 5.288,
p < .05;
Fig. S1h), and in the canopy (primary = 23.1%; logged = 8.6%;
LR = 9.174, p < .01; Fig. S1i). Thus, 9–12 years after logging there
were significant differences in forest structure between logged and
primary forests. This was especially true for the components of for-
est structure that typically indicate the presence of large, mature
trees and high structural complexity, and which might be expected
to influence microclimates and the availability of microhabitats.

Macroclimate and microclimate temperature
in logged and primary forest
Despite differences in forest structure, we found no difference in macro-
climate temperature of logged and primary forests, whether measured by
the hygrometer (LR = 0.081, p = .776; Fig. S2a) or suspended datalogger
(LR = 0, p = .983; Fig. S2b). Macroclimate temperature was also consis-
tent across varying levels of forest quality, for temperature measured via
the hygrometer (LR = 0.022, p = .883; Fig. S2a) and suspended datalog-
ger (LR = 0.527, p = .468; Fig. S2b). Thus, the necessity for thermal
buffering was comparable between the two forest types.
Absolute microclimate temperature was comparable between for-
est types for all of the microclimates considered: surface (LR = 0.447,
p = .504; Figure 3e), deadwood (LR = 0.206, p = .65; Figure 3f), tree
holes (LR = 2.759, p = .097; Figure 3g) and leaf litter (LR = 1.616,
p = .204; Figure 3h). We found that the relationship between micro-
climate temperature and macroclimate temperature was slightly stee-
per in primary forest compared to logged forest for deadwood
(LR = 7.268, p < .01; Figure 3b), tree holes (LR = 13.657, p < .001;
Figure 3c) and leaf litter (LR = 28.914, p < .001; Figure 3d). However,
for 1°C macroclimate warming (from the median value) the maximum
difference in microclimate warming between forest types was <0.1°C,
and no such interaction was apparent for surface microclimates
(LR = 1.197, p = .274; Figure 3a). Similarly, for a 1 m2/ha increase in
forest quality (i.e. tree stand basal area), tree hole temperature was
slightly warmer (LR = 4.661, p < .05; Figure 3g), but the size of this
effect was negligible (+0.00194°C), and not evident for other microcli-
mates (p > .05; Figure 3e–h). Thus we conclude that effects of logging
on microclimate temperature were generally not evident, or minimal.
The final facet of microclimate temperature that we considered
was daily temperature variation. This too was comparable between
logged
and
primary
forests
for
microclimates
at
the
surface
(LR = 0.437, p = .508; Figure 4a), as well as those inside deadwood
(LR = 0.02, p = .889; Figure 4b), tree holes (LR = 3.242, p = .072;
Figure 4c) and leaf litter (LR = 2.449, p = .118; Figure 4d). Microcli-
mate temperature variation was also consistent across different
levels of forest quality (p > .05; Figure 4).
In summary, selective logging had little observed impact on absolute
microclimate temperature or its daily variation. There was some evi-
dence that thermal buffering potential was slightly enhanced for dead-
wood, tree holes and leaf litter inside logged forest, but the effects
were extremely small and not evident for microclimates at the surface.

Microclimate availability in logged and primary
forest
The thermal buffering potential within a habitat depends not only on
the temperature of microclimates relative to the macroclimate, but
also on the overall availability and thermal diversity of those microcli-
mates. The occurrence of surface microclimates was not impacted by
forest type (LR = 0.872, p = .35; Figure 5b), and the average volume
of microhabitats (per m2 forest) was similar in logged and primary for-
est for deadwood (LR = 0.263, p = .608; Figure 5d), tree holes
(LR = 3.053, p = .081; Figure 5e) and leaf litter (LR = 0.162, p = .687;
Figure 5f). There was no observed impact of forest quality on the
occurrence of surface microclimates (LR = 1.324, p = .25; Figure 5b)
or the volume of deadwood (LR = 3.78, p = .052; Figure 5d) and tree
holes (LR = 2.172, p = .141; Figure 5e). In contrast, we found that leaf
litter volume increased by 12.3 cm3/m2 for a 1 m2/ha increase in for-
est quality (i.e. tree stand basal area; LR = 7.056, p < .01; Figure 5f).
Using thermal images we were able to quantify the thermal
diversity and spatial configuration of surface microclimates. Thermal
diversity has a bearing on the diversity of organisms that are able to
find microclimates meeting their thermal requirements (which vary
according to species, age, time of day, seasonality, etc.). Spatial con-
figuration influences the ease with which organisms can utilize
microclimates. We found that the temperature range spanned by
surface microclimates (both warm and cool patches) was comparable

between logged and primary forests (LR = 0.276, p = .599; Fig-

(Χ² = 0.312, p = .576; Figure 5c) and with different levels of forest

Overall, the availability of microclimates was minimally affected
by selective logging, regardless of whether microclimates were
located at the surface or inside microhabitats. This was true for vari-
ous different components of microclimate availability, including their
occurrence, thermal diversity and spatial configuration.

DISCUSSION
Forest degradation by commercial selective logging affects huge
expanses of the tropics (Asner et al., 2009; Lewis, Edwards, &
Galbraith, 2015). Southeast Asia has experienced the most intensive
selective logging of all tropical rainforests (Lewis et al., 2015), and in
our study area ~145 m3 of timber was removed per hectare. Despite
these forests having only a maximum of 12-yr postlogging recovery
(Fisher et al., 2011), and the coincidental occurrence during data col-
lection of abnormally hot and dry conditions associated with the
strongest El Ni~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event since 1998
(NOAA, 2015), we found very few thermal differences associated
with selective logging. This is an important finding for tropical con-
servation because it suggests that the potential for thermal buffering
will not limit the ability of selectively logged forests to maintain high
biodiversity under climate change.

target larger and older trees, leading to many associated changes in
vegetation structure (Edwards, Tobias et al., 2014; Kumar & Sha-
habuddin, 2005; Okuda et al., 2003). A clear signal of historical logging
in our study area was a reduction in stand basal area of mature trees
by 40.8% (Fig. S1a; Berry, Phillips, Ong, & Hamer, 2008), accompanied
by reduced variation in tree basal area (Fig. S1c), and reduced vegeta-
tion cover at ≥15 m height (Fig. S1h,i). The increase in stand basal area
of saplings by 41.1% (Fig. S1b) is evidence that there has been sub-
stantial natural regeneration in the intervening years.
4.2

Macroclimate and microclimate temperature
Although primary forest contained more large trees (Fig. S1a), the
absence of any long-term effect of selective logging on percentage
canopy cover (Fig. S1f) suggests that forest vegetation as a whole—
regardless of how it was distributed vertically—intercepted compara-
ble amounts of incoming solar radiation in both logged and primary
forests. This finding is in keeping with previous studies observing
rapid horizontal canopy growth following selective logging (e.g.
Asner et al., 2004). Alternatively, vegetation in logged forest may
have intercepted less incoming radiation than in primary forest (i.e. if
there was less vegetation overall), but reflected a greater proportion
of what was intercepted, owing to the higher albedo of habitats with
an abundance of non-tree species (Davin & de Noblet-Ducoudre,
2010; Edwards, Tobias et al., 2014; Oke, 1987). In either case (or in
combination), given comparable levels of solar radiation reaching the
forest floor of logged and primary forests, it follows that the temper-
ature at coarse and fine scales (macroclimate and microclimate tem-
peratures) should also be comparable (Figure 3 and Fig. S2).
The

relative to average
conditions
is
what
largely
determines
their
ability
to
buffer
macroclimate warming (Gonzalez del Pliego et al., 2016; Scheffers,
Brett et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2016). Given that selective logging did
not affect absolute temperature of the macroclimate (Fig. S2) or
microclimates (Figure 3), we can infer that there was no overall
effect of selective logging on the difference between micro- and
macroclimate temperature. There was also no evidence that selective
logging impacted overall daily variation in microclimate temperature
(Figure 4). There were some impacts of logging on the relationship
between microclimate and macroclimate temperature for microcli-
mates inside deadwood, tree holes and leaf litter (Figure 3), but the
effect sizes for these interactions were extremely small. The maxi-
mum difference in microclimate warming between logged and pri-
mary forests was <0.1°C for 1°C of macroclimate warming. As such,
we conclude that even when selective logging had a statistically sig-
nificant influence on thermal buffering potential, the effect was small
and of limited biological relevance.

Microclimate availability
Even if microclimates are present and effective at buffering tempera-
ture change, overall rarity or isolation could render them functionally
redundant to some species (Sears et al., 2011, 2016). We demon-
strate that lower forest quality was associated with less leaf litter
(Figure 5; cf. Saner et al., 2009), but forest quality and forest type
had little effect on the occurrence of microclimates at the surface or
inside deadwood and tree holes. This is contrary to expectations
from previous studies (Ball, Lindenmayer, & Possingham, 1999; Bla-
kely & Didham, 2008). However, high volumes of deadwood could
be maintained in logged forest by lower decomposition rates (Ewers
et al., 2015; Yeong, Reynolds, & Hill, 2016; but see Herault et al.,
2010),

undisturbed forests, tree holes tend to be associated with larger,
older trees (Blakely & Didham, 2008; Lindenmayer, Cunningham,
Pope, Gibbons, & Donnelly, 2000). A comparable quantity of tree
holes might be found in logged forests because of damage from log-
ging operations (Edwards, Tobias et al., 2014), increased wind in
gaps (Chen, Franklin, & Spies, 1995) and remnant large trees that
were specifically avoided by logging companies because of hollow
boles. In addition, we assessed tree holes in the understorey only,
and differences may well manifest at higher forest strata.
The availability of microclimates to organisms is also influenced
by their thermal diversity and distribution in space. We found that
patches of warm and cool microclimates on the surface of the forest
floor spanned a temperature range of about 3°C, regardless of log-
ging activity (Figure 5a). Cool patches were generally highly clustered
in space (Aggregation index of 83.3%), but this was not affected by
logging (Figure 5c). Thermal diversity and spatial configuration of
microclimates are relatively novel facets of thermal buffering poten-
tial (but see: Caillon et al., 2014; Faye, Rebaudo, Yanez-Cajo, Cauvy-
Fraunie, & Dangles, 2016; Sears et al., 2016); they are likely deter-
mined by the composition of the forest floor and the relative radia-
tive properties of these different components (e.g. bare soil versus
leaves versus water; Oke, 1987; Snyder, Foley, Hitchman, & Delire,
2004). We therefore suggest that these characteristics of the forest
floor were comparable between forests despite the large differences
in forest structure that were evident after logging.

2017). Many ectotherms, including amphibians (Duellman & Trueb,
1986) and isopods (Hassall, Edwards, Carmenta, Derhe, & Moss,
2010), can survive in hot temperatures for longer if relative humidity
is sufficiently high to prevent desiccation. Although we did not mea-
sure fine-scale vapour pressure deficit (a variable combining both
temperature and relative humidity), we did find that coarse-scale
vapour pressure deficit measurements from the hygrometer and
from hygrochron iButtons (Supplementary Text S4) showed little
variation within or between forests (Fig. S2).
Relative climates in primary and logged forests could be very dif-
ferent above the understorey, which we were unable to capture in
our study. Some ectotherms move from the upper strata to exploit
more favourable temperatures lower down (Scheffers et al., 2013).
Hence, if temperatures in higher strata are in fact hotter in logged
forest compared to primary forest, it is possible that species could
move to utilize the favourable temperatures of the understorey of
logged forest that we demonstrate here, potentially resulting in a
“flattening” of species’ vertical distributions.
While thermal cameras are an important addition to the toolbox
of microclimate research (Faye et al., 2016), it is also important to
remember that they are just one element. Thermal cameras are well-
suited to capturing temperature at a very fine-scale and with inher-
ent spatial information, but differences in 3D topography of a sur-
face could affect results (e.g. the real distance between neighbouring
pixels can be more than is apparent in the 2D image). In addition,
although thermal cameras are ideal for measuring surface tempera-
tures, they have a limited capacity to capture subsurface tempera-
tures, and hence we have used thermal imagery in combination with
dataloggers.
The ability of selectively logged tropical forests to retain current
levels of biodiversity will critically depend on their ability to protect
species from the impacts of increasingly severe climate change. As
average temperatures increase over this century, so too will the
intensity and frequency of extreme climatic events. Thermal buffer-
ing will likely be crucial in allowing species to move locally to avoid
suboptimal climates. We sampled in some of the most intensively
logged forest in the tropics, during abnormally hot and dry condi-
tions of a severe ENSO event; it is highly unlikely that our study
would have failed to detect any appreciable thermal differences
between primary and logged forests had they existed. Regardless of
whether commercially selectively logged forests remain biologically
or structurally distinctive from undisturbed forests, this study shows
for the first time that they are functionally equivalent in the provi-
sioning of cool microclimates, and underscores their vital role in con-
servation both now and under future climate warming.
