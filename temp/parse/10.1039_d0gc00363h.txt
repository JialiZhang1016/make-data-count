Small molecule synthesis is equally important for materials and pharmaceuticals. However, the traditional
approach performed in pharmaceutical R&D including maintenance of million-sized libraries and optimiz-
ation synthesis of hundreds or even thousands of chemicals on a mmol or larger scale lacks sustainability.
Here, we exemplify the synthetic execution of a newly designed quinoxaline reaction towards a transfor-
mative sustainability in chemistry. This includes nanoscale synthesis, deep chemical space exploration,
scalability over 6 orders of magnitude from milligram up to 10-gram resynthesis of quinazolines enabled
by the simultaneous variation of four classes of building blocks. Beneﬁts of our approach include a simple
to perform, one-step procedure, mild reaction conditions and access to a very large chemical space
through accessing many available building blocks. More than thousand derivatives were produced in an
automated fashion on a nanoscale using positive pressure facilitated dispensing. Along with these advan-
tages, there is a considerable reduction in synthetic eﬀort, reagents, solvent, glass and plastic consum-
ables and power consumption to decrease the footprint of synthetic chemistry.
Introduction
Chemistry is the central science that ameliorates human exist-
ence by producing compounds of great use in energy, agriculture,
electronics, pharmaceuticals, personal care, cosmetics, and
flavors and fragrances. However, with an ever-growing number of
planetary inhabitants, sustainability is the only guaranty of a
livable future. Achieving a sustainable future in chemistry is the
major goal of green chemistry.1 Often chemists use the 12
Principles of Green Chemistry as a blueprint for chemical design
for sustainability throughout the life cycle of chemicals.2 Eﬀorts
to increase the green footprint of organic synthetic chemistry
(e.g. non chlorinated solvents, catalysis, non-toxic reagents) are
therefore major transformative drivers of a sustainable future in
industry and society.3 Despite these honorable ideas, the reality
of contemporary chemistry in wide areas looks quite diﬀerent:
energy intensive processes, toxic reagents and solvents, expen-
sive, wasteful and time-consuming sequential target syntheses
resulting in overall low yields, clearly far from sustainability.
Particularly, medicinal chemistry can be highlighted as a chem-
istry area where inclusion of sustainable methods and processes
would have a tremendous impact.4 Pharmaceutical R&D is a
highly compound intensive chemistry area. Large and medium
sized pharma companies keep millions of compounds in screen-
ing libraries, traditionally on a gram scale, more recently on a
multi milligram scale. These have to be regularly renewed to stay
competitive and cope with ‘novelty erosion’.5 These screening
compounds are mostly produced via multistep synthetic routes
that are neither optimal nor green. Next, the hits from high
throughput screening of the million compounds have to be opti-
mized for ‘drug-like’ properties in tedious, lengthy and expensive
processes involving the synthesis of thousands of intermediates
and target compounds. Despite the exploratory scale, waste gene-
ration in early drug discovery is considerable. Conservatively, it
has been estimated that up to 2 million kilograms of waste are
produced per year in drug discovery with up to 1.5 million kilo-
grams of additional waste produced per year in preclinical
studies.6 Inevitably, drug compound optimization involves mul-
tiple low-yielding steps, often requires several solvent-intensive
chromatographic purifications, and generates a large amount of
plastic, glass and paper consumable waste. Key to sustainability
in synthetic chemistry is waste reduction. The principle of pre-
vention has been recently highlighted to overshadow all other
principles of green chemistry.7 The emerging field of reaction
miniaturization is therefore oﬀering an outstanding opportunity
in the ultra-conservation of advanced pharmaceutical intermedi-

ates and additionally in the overall reduction of waste achieved
by performing reactions on a smaller scale.4 Moreover, multicom-
ponent reaction chemistry is based on the principles of atom
economy, step prevention, convergence and has been recognized
since a long time to come close to ‘perfect’ green chemistry and
has also been recently reviewed in this context.8 It has been
repeatedly shown that by introducing a multicomponent reaction
(MCR) into a target synthesis, the overall number of steps can be
considerably reduced while yields are increased.9–11 A perfect
example is the Teleprevir HCV inhibitor synthesis by Orru et al.10
Introducing two MCR steps in the synthesis of this complex pep-
tidomimetic compound reduced the lengthy >20 step industrial
synthesis by ∼50%. Here we exemplary showcase the discovery
and scope and limitation study of a new reaction leading to the
small molecule quinazoline scaﬀold based on several major sus-
tainability principles.
Design – synthesis
Initially,
we
designed
a
one-step
general
synthesis
of
medium cycles from readily accessible starting materials
employing the archetypical Ugi-4CR.12–14 We hypothesized
that suitable α-formyl-ω-carboxylic acids (C) will react with a
medium cycle ring upon addition of a primary amine (D)
and an isocyanide (E) (Fig. 1A). To gain access to a diversity
of
α-formyl-ω-carboxylic
acids
(C)
we
planned
to
react
o-formyl anilines and heteroaromates (A) with cyclic car-
boxylic acid anhydrides (B). Both building blocks are com-
mercially available in larger numbers with diﬀerent substitu-
ents and ring sizes. Surprisingly and proven by a small mole-
cule crystal structure, we found that a 2,3,4-trisubstituted
quinazoline (P) is formed instead of the expected medium
cycle (Fig. 1A and B and 2). Opportunistically we figured that
the quinazoline scaﬀold shares key pharmacophoric and
structural features of a large number of biologically relevant
compounds (Fig. 1C).15
We commenced our study by the synthesis of α-formyl-
ω-carboxylic acids as building blocks via a simple ring opening
reaction of cyclic anhydride with various derivatives of 2-ami-
nobenzaldehyde,
both
commercially
available
in
great
numbers. To optimize the reaction conditions of the model
system using 2-aminobenzaldehyde/glutaric anhydride, we
tried diﬀerent solvents and mixtures, temperatures and ratios

of reactants (ESI Table S1†). The best conditions were the
1 : 1.1 ratio of 2-aminobenzaldehyde/glutaric anhydride and
refluxing in dioxane to aﬀord the desired product in 95%
yield. Fifteen α-formyl-ω-carboxylic acids of diﬀerent lengths
were synthesized in good purity and yields, each on a gram
scale (Fig. 3). This included benzene as well as pyridine deriva-
tives (C-3, C-10). The diversity of the included anhydrides
range from 5 to 7-membered simple aliphatic chains (C-1, C-2,
C-15) to 3,3-dimethyl substituents (C-4), to cis-alkene (C-11,
C-12), phenyl (C-13), and spiro cycle (C-5) and to a confor-
mationally constrained cyclopropyl annulated ring (C-14). It
also includes basic nitrogen (C-7), oxygen (C-9) or sulfur (C-8).
The
aminobenzaldehyde
component showed
variation
in
halogen (C-6, C-7, C-12, C-14) as well as two positional pyridine
isomers (C-3, C-10).
In the next step, we optimized the conditions of the quina-
zoline ring closure via a Ugi reaction (Fig. 4). The optimization
was performed by using 5-((2-formylphenyl)amino)-5-oxopen-
tanoic acid (C-2), 2-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethan-1-amine (D-22),
and
benzyl
isocyanide
(E-25)
as
a
model
reaction
(ESI
Table S2†). We probed various parameters including solvents,
acid additives, ratios of reactants, microwaves, and sonication.
Polar aprotic solvents such as THF and CH3CN gave the
product in moderate yields of 30% and 22%, respectively, at
room temperature, but methanol and trifluoroethanol showed
better results. As trifluoroethanol (TFE, 76% yield) was slightly
superior to MeOH (71% yield), we chose TFE for further scope
and limitation studies. Next, diﬀerent acids such as ZnCl2, Sc
(OTf)3, Al(OTf)3, and p-TSA were screened. It was found that
the addition of Lewis or Brønsted acids does not make a great
diﬀerence in the percentage yield of products. Additionally, we
investigated diﬀerent stoichiometries of α-formyl-ω-carboxylic
acids, amines and isocyanides. Using less than 2 equivalents
of amine and isocyanide does not have any eﬀect on the per-
centage yield, but it reduces the amount of unreacted starting
materials. Moreover, we investigated sonication and microwave
conditions,
however
the
reaction
works
best
at
room
temperature.
With the optimized reaction conditions in hand, the scope
and limitations of the Ugi-quinazoline reaction were further
investigated by synthesizing large libraries of compounds
using nanoscale automated chemistry (Fig. 5).
Nanoscale synthesis
Recently we reported nanoscale synthesis of libraries of
diﬀerent scaﬀolds using acoustic dispensing ejection techno-
logy (ADE).16–18 A disadvantage of ADE is the limited solvent
compatibility which somehow restricts organic chemical reac-
tions. Currently, only solvents are compatible with a rather
high boiling point and a low volatility such as DMSO, water,
ethylene glycol and similar solvents. However, Ugi reactions
prefer to be performed in low boiling alcohols and in the
current reaction we found trifluoroethanol to be favored over
other solvents. Therefore, we were evaluating a range of other
nano-dispensing technologies which are compatible with a
broader range of volatile solvents. The “Immediate Drop on
Demand Technology” (I-DOT) is such a nano-dispensing
technology and has been mostly applied to analytical and bio-
logical questions (Fig. 5A–D).19–22 A well-defined pressure
pulse on top of a 96-well microliter plate housing the building
block stock solutions with holes in the bottom of each well
forms a highly precise nanoliter droplet that is released into
any target plate (96-, 384-well or higher formats). The I-DOT
source plate is located above the target plate that moves under-
neath. Each individual source well can dispense into each well
in the target plate with a diﬀerent and precise volume. Up to
96 diﬀerent liquids can be used within one dispensing run.
This approach enables highly eﬃcient combinatorial dispen-
sing useful in chemistry. Larger volumes are achieved by apply-
ing up to 400 pulses per second. As the ADE system, the plat-
form works contact-less and is sustainable as it avoids the use
of plastic tips. Using in-house written software, we synthesized
non-combinatorial libraries in 384-well plates by combining
three building blocks in each target plate well.
The reactions were performed at 0.16 M concentration with
a total volume of 500 nL per well by dispensing TFE stock solu-
tions of the building blocks into the target plate wells. 42
Primary amines and 41 isocyanides were used to build the

libraries (Fig. 7). The time to fill a 384-well plate with the three
starting material classes of building blocks was less than
20 min. The reactions were run at room temperature for 24 h
by sealing the plates and leaving them on a shaker. Then the
plates were desealed and analysis of the wells was performed
by injecting the crude mixtures into a mass spectrometer.
Using in-house written software, the raw MS data were ana-
lyzed for the presence of reaction products. A qualitative three-
color classifier was used: blue for no reaction product, yellow
for minor product formation and green for major product for-
mation. A typical analysis outcome shown in Fig. 6 resulted in
39% major product and 34% minor product formation and
27% failed reactions (Fig. 5F). A total of three 384-well plates
were filled resulting in 1.152 reactions. The used building
blocks go much beyond what is usually employed during the
report of a new reaction and scaﬀold. However, it is important
to challenge new reactions with many diﬀerent steric and elec-
tronic building block variants to gain a ‘real-world’ insight
into the scope and limitations.
Of note is the great functional group tolerance of the new
quinazoline synthesis: dimethoxyacetale (D-23, E-14), hetero-
cycles such as tetrahydrofuran (E-29), indole (D-35, E-22), thio-
phene (D-24, E-38), morpholine (D-39, E-6), piperidine (D-40),
azetidine (D-25), pyridine (D-3, D-21, D-33, E-3), furan (D-28),
alkyne (D-14), alkene (D-41), primary alcohol (D-7, D-15), ether
(D-10, D-17, E-31), Boc-protected amine (D-11, D-25, D-27,
E-19), ester (E-15, E-22, E-41), nitrile (D-12), sulfonamide
(D-31),
and
tertiary amine
(D-40);
aliphatic
cycles
from
3–6 membered (D-6, D-34, D-29, D-4), highly substituted
benzene (E-23) and a very bulky adamantly group (D-37).
Mmol and gram scale synthesis
Scalability of a given reaction is important. For example,
during the optimization process of a lead compound, a gram
amount of high-quality material is needed for performing
many diﬀerent biological assays including pharmacokinetic

studies in animals. Scalability is more complex than just
making larger quantities of a particular compound. It is well
known that many reactions are diﬃcult to reproduce (yield,
impurity profile, reaction setup, course, and workup), pose
safety concerns (exotherms, decomposition profiles), and
exhibit issues in waste handling (limited number of acceptable
solvents), cost
(yields, expensive stoichiometric reagents),
sourcing (suppliers), and ease of operation (avoiding chrom-
atography, fractional vacuum distillation, etc.). Thus, we inves-
tigated the scalability of our novel quinazoline synthesis from
the nano scale to gram scale. Resynthesis of several com-
pounds on a mmol scale confirmed the excellent performance
of the new MCR quinazoline synthesis. 15 compounds could
be isolated in 40 to 88% yields with an average of 66% and
fully characterized by NMR, HRMS, IR and single-crystal X-ray
crystallography (ESI page 76†), (Fig. 6).
Next, we investigated the scalability of the reaction beyond
1 mmol (Fig. 8). The first acylation step was performed in
refluxing dioxane to isolate 90% of α-formyl-ω-carboxylic acid
(C-2) on a 7 g scale as a pale-yellow powder. The Ugi reaction
in trifluoroethanol as a solvent at room temperature gave C11
in >80% yield and >10 g of a yellow solid. Thus, we could show
that our newly discovered quinazoline synthesis is easily scal-
able over 6 orders of magnitude from nmol (81 nmol) to mmol
(30 mmol).
A mechanism of this unusual Ugi reaction is proposed in
Fig. 9. Accordingly, a Schiﬀbase (I1) is formed from the
primary amine (D) and the α-formyl-ω-carboxylic acid (C)
which is protonated (I2) and thereby activated towards the
nucleophilic attack of the isocyanide forming the nitrilium ion
(I3). Nucleophilic attack of the carboxylate to the nitrilium
carbon (I4), followed by a transannular attack of the secondary
amine to the benzamide carbonyl (I5) followed by dehydration
yields the tricyclic intermediate (I6). Unusual in this mechanis-
tic proposal is the avoidance of the common Mumm rearrange-
ment (I4) which would give a strained medium cycle inter-
mediate (ring size between 9 and 11, dependent on the ring
size of the anhydride). We hypothesize that the medium cycle
is very unstable based on the considerable antiperiplanar and
transannular ring strains. The ring strain in medium sized car-
bocycles has been intensively investigated and described.23,24
Water instead hydrolyzes the N-heteroanhydride structure (I6)
and the tricyclic bridgehead structure forms a favorable
6-membered bicyclic product (P).
Chemoinformatics
A simplified pharmacophore model and some calculated pro-
perties for the novel quinazoline scaﬀold are shown in Fig. 10.
The compounds are zwitterions with a positive and negative
charge area. The isocyanide-derived amide group lies orthog-
onal to the quinazoline ring plane, thus featuring a strong 3D
character of the scaﬀold. The density and orientation of the
scaﬀold-intrinsic pharmacophores provide ample opportu-
nities to interact with biological receptors. The ‘escape from
flatness’ 3D property (Fsp3) has recently been proposed to con-
tribute to the drug-likeliness of small molecules (Fig. 10B).25

cular weight are two other important determinants. The mole-
cular weight and the lipophilicity of a considerable part of the
synthesized library are in a ‘preferred’ region (Fig. 10C). Due to
the scaﬀold intrinsic charge it can be expected that the mole-
cules will not easily pass the cell membrane. However, many
known charged bioactive compounds can pass the membrane
if a transporter mechanism applies.
The accessibility and availability of small organic molecules
with a high functional group density as seen in the structural
complexity of pharmaceuticals presents a significant challenge
to modern synthetic reactions. Many published methods that
work well on simple substrates often fail when attempts are
made to apply them to complex drug intermediates. Although
the number of compounds synthesized in the industry is stea-
dily increasing over the years, a heavy population bias towards
only a few chemical reactions can be observed. It was noted

that a limited arsenal of medicinal chemistry reactions may
narrow the available chemistry space to structurally similar
compounds which spill over to perhaps (unwanted) biased
screening collections. Therefore, novel synthetic methods, e.g.
multicomponent reactions, may not only unlock access to pre-
viously unattainable chemical matter, but also inspire new
concepts as to how to design and build chemical matter.26 Our
herein
introduced
quinazoline
synthesis
comprises
an
example of high throughput experimentation on a nano scale
allowing for a rapid screening of the scope and limitations of a
unique reaction towards a novel scaﬀold.27 The two-step syn-
thesis involves in the first step a macroscopic gram-scale acyla-
tion of o-amino benzaldehydes or corresponding heterocycles
with cyclic carboxylic acid anhydride to aﬀord α-formyl-
ω-carboxylic acid building blocks, followed by a microscopic
nano-scale Ugi reaction to form highly substituted quinazo-
lines according to an unprecedented mechanism. The minute
reagent and solvent consumption of ∼50 mg of building
blocks and ∼0.6 ml of solvent is a feature of this work contri-
buting to the sustainability of the nano synthesis approach
described herein. The nanoscale synthesis was facilitated by a
positive pressure dispenser (I-DOT) and >1000 reactions could
be processed in several 384-well plates in a short time and in
an automated fashion. The nanoscale synthesis and the tip-
less feature of I-DOT additionally contribute to lowering the
synthetic chemistry footprint. MS analysis of the plates
revealed that 1/3 of the expected products were formed well,
while 1/3 where not formed at all. The automation aspect
increases safety as chemists are less in contact with hazardous
chemicals. The scalability of the nano reactions was shown by
the resynthesis of 15 quinazolines on a mmol scale in gener-
ally good to very good yields. One quinazoline was even pre-
pared on a 10 g scale in 73% overall yield (over two steps).
Moreover, the scope of the building blocks was shown to be
great and many functional groups were tolerated. The com-
pounds of the library were found to have all over benign pro-
perties (MW, clog P and Fsp3) and the compounds were found
to be stable at room temperature and in aqueous buﬀer at
37 °C. We are currently testing the compound libraries against
therapeutic targets and screening results will be reported in
due course.
