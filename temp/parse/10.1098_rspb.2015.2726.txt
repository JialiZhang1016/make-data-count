Dietary restriction (DR), a reduction in nutrient intakewithout malnutrition, isthe
most reproducible way to extend lifespan in a wide range of organisms across the
tree of life, yet the evolutionary underpinnings of the DReffect on lifespan are still
widely debated. The leading theory suggests that this effect is adaptive and
results from reallocation of resources from reproduction to somatic maintenance,
in order to survive periods of famine in nature. However, such response would
cease to be adaptive when DR is chronic and animals are selected to allocate
more resources to reproduction. Nevertheless, chronic DR can also increase the
strength of selection resulting in the evolution of more robust genotypes. We
evolved Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies on ‘DR’, ‘standard’ and ‘high’ adult
diets in replicate populations with overlapping generations. After approximately
25 generations of experimental evolution, male ‘DR’ flies had higher fitness than
males from ‘standard’ and ‘high’ populations. Strikingly, this increase in repro-
ductive success did not come at a cost to survival. Our results suggest that
sustained DR selects for more robust male genotypes that are overall better in
converting resources into energy, which they allocate mostly to reproduction.
1. Introduction
Dietary restriction (DR) is to date one of the most robust interventions that pro-
long lifespan in a wide range of organisms [1], whereas excess-nutrient diets
are associated with negative effects [2]. While the understanding of nutritional
[3] and molecular [4] mechanisms of lifespan extension under DR has progressed
immensely in recent years, the evolutionary basis of the DR effect remains ambig-
uous [5], and there have been few empirical studies that explicitly test existing
theories. Most often, a holding out for better times argument is implicated as the
adaptive cause for DR-mediated lifespan extension. More formally, this can be
framed by applying the disposable soma theory of ageing [6]. According to this
theory, the DR effect is an adaptive plastic response of organisms, which optimize
their fitness by reallocating their resources from reproduction into somatic
maintenance, and hence into survival, when resources are scarce [6].
Because the resource reallocation theory is based on the assumption that the
DR effect is an adaptation, which allows surviving a temporary shortage of
food until the resources become plentiful again, the corollary is that the DR
effect will become maladaptive if food shortage is permanent. Under sustained
DR, individuals that produce more offspring in such suboptimal conditions will
be selected for rather than individuals that can survive for longer. Therefore,
evolution under sustained DR is predicted to increase reproduction and
reduce the DR effect, provided there is standing genetic variation for this plastic

response [7]. On the other hand, evolution under high
resource availability should not select against plasticity
under short-term DR (observed as the classic DR effect),
unless simply carrying the gene(s) responsible for the DR
effect is costly (i.e. if there is a cost of plasticity [8]).
The above scenario, however, ignores other potential
sources of selection that a population may experience under
DR. It is often suggested that environmental stress increases
selection (e.g. [9], but see [10]). Two recent studies in different
invertebrate taxa showed that evolution under temperature
stress can result in the correlated evolution of increased
fecundity accompanied by either increased or unaltered life-
span [11,12]. DR is a form of an environmental stressor,
and might therefore result in stronger selection on genetic
quality, compared with when nutrition is more plentiful.
Furthermore, Adler & Bonduriansky [5] recently proposed a
controversial new theory, which maintains that the DR effect
may be an unselected by-product of maximizing reproduction
during famine. Specifically, this theory suggests that the DR
effect is driven bya highly conserved nutrient recycling mechan-
ism, autophagy, which maximizes the use of internal resources
for reproduction under food shortage and as a by-product
extends lifespan of organisms under protected laboratory con-
ditions. Under this hypothesis, evolution under sustained DR
will select for individuals that are better at converting low
amounts of available energy into reproduction, hence leading
to the evolution of increased reproduction under long-term DR
accompanied by the evolution of increased lifespan.
Because the prolongevity effect of DR is a key target
for applied research on lifespan extension in humans, it is
important to understand its evolutionary foundation. To test
how lifespan, reproduction and their relationship change
during evolution under sustained DR, we set up experimen-
tal populations of fruit flies (Dahomey strain of Drosophila
melanogaster), kept either on DR, standard (ancestral) or high
diets (‘evolution diets’) as adults, with DR, standard and
high referring to the manipulated dietary yeast content of 40
(classic DR diet for Drosophila), 100 and 270 g yeast per litre
diet, respectively). Fly larvae from all populations were
raised on the standard diet. Flies were kept in mixed-sex popu-
lation cages (approximately 150 individuals per sex per
population, four replicate populations per treatment) with
overlapping
generations
(see
electronic
supplementary
material for detailed experimental protocols). After 500 days
of
experimental
evolution
(approx.
25
generations),
we
measured male lifespan and reproductive performance of all
12 experimental populations from the three ‘evolution diets’ in
all three corresponding ‘assay diets’. We focused on male flies
here, which are usually understudied in ageing research in
invertebrate models, and estimate their reproductive perform-
ance in a well-established reproduction assay where both
natural selection and sexual selection jointly determine focal
male fitness in competition with standardized competitor males.
2. Methods
(a) Experimental design
(i) Set-up and maintenance of experimental evolution
population cages
Flies used to set up the experimental evolution population cages
were all derived from the wild-type, outbred and long-term
laboratory-adapted D. melanogaster population Dahomey. Foun-
ders of this population were originally collected in Dahomey
(now Benin) in 1970. Since then, the fly population has been kept
in population cages containing more than 3000 individuals with
overlapping generations, on standard 1.0 sugar–yeast (SY) diet
(with baker’s yeast as protein source). Prior to populating cages,
flies were raised on standard 1.0 SY diet (with brewer’s yeast)
with approximately 100 eggs per vial (plastic, 28.5  95 mm) for
two generations. This was done to assure that there was no
random phenotypic bias in founder flies. Emerging adult flies of
the third generation were lightly anaesthetized with CO2 and dis-
tributed into experimental population cages, made out of clear
plastic (26.5  16.5  15.5 cm) with one opening, closed by fine
nylon mesh. We populated each cage with 150 males and 150
females, and set up four replicate cages per diet. We used three
diets that differed in their yeast concentration (40, 100 or 270 g
per 1 litre of diet: from here on DR, standard and high protein
diet, respectively; electronic supplementary material, table S1)
and therefore in their protein-to-carbohydrate ratio. Diets were
prepared by mixing required quantities of agar, sugar, yeast and
water together. We then boiled the mixture in an autoclave at
1218C for 30 min. When the solution had cooled down to 658C,
we added propionic acid and nipagin solution to prevent
fungal and bacterial growth, and dispensed it into plastic contai-
ners (10  10  4.5 cm; 120 ml in each container). Flies were
maintained in a climate chamber at 258C and 60% humidity, on
a 12 : 12 h light : dark cycle. Food was exchanged twice every
week (Monday and Thursday). On these occasions, dead flies
were counted and removed from cages, without determining the
sex of the dead flies. Cages were carefully cleaned on Mondays.
On Thursdays, we transferred eggs laid on the surface of the
food into two vials per cage, with approximately 100 eggs per
vial. These vials contained ancestral diet on which the larvae devel-
oped. Offspring (1–2-day-old adults) from these vials were used
each Monday to re-establish the original density of 300 individuals
per cage, putting back the same number of flies that were counted
dead over the last week, with a sex ratio of 1 : 1. This allowed the
developmentofpopulationswithoverlappinggenerations(age-struc-
tured) over time. Owing to the higher mortalityon the high evolution
diet (electronic supplementary material, table S2), the numberof gen-
erations for a given amount of days that the experimental evolution
cages have been maintained might be slightly higher in high-diet
cages, compared with ancestral and low-diet cages.
Experimental evolution has proven to be one of the most
valuable experimental methods to study evolution in the labora-
tory [13]. Yet there are also potential problems associated with
this experimental approach. Exposure to a novel environment,
inbreeding and long-term selection can all contribute to obscure
underlying trade-offs [14]. Although experimental evolution by
definition always entails exposure to a novel environment, our
experimental populations were exposed to a culturing protocol
close to the one experienced by our base population, minimiz-
ing this problem. The size of our experimental populations
should effectively prevent problems associated with inbreeding.
Trade-offs between lifespan and fecundity should have been
apparent in this relatively short experimental evolution study,
even if such trade-offs may disappear over the long term. We
will be able to assess the reported effects in long-term selected
populations, as our lines are still maintained.
(ii) Assay design
After 500 days of experimental evolution in the cages described
above (equivalent to approx. 25 generations, assuming a gener-
ation time of 20 days), we raised flies from each cage for two
generations under standardized conditions (see set-up for popu-
lation cages above), and used the third generation to set up 108
experimental vials (28.5  95 mm). Each vial was populated
with 40 male flies. Flies were provided with one of the three

diets used in the experimental evolution cages, with three repli-
cate vials per cage and diet combination (12 cages, three diets per
cage, four replicates).
(iii) Mortality and reproductive performance assays
Mortality was checked each week on Monday, Wednesday and
Friday, when flies were flipped into new food vials. We measured
male reproductive performance at ages 7, 28 and 56 days post eclo-
sion into adulthood. For this, we gave the males of each vial the
opportunity to mate with 40 females. These females were homozy-
gous for the recessive marker ebony (e), a mutation that darkens
the body colour, which earlier had been introgressed into the
Dahomey genetic background. Ebony females were allowed to
mate with ebony males for the first 2 days after eclosion into adult-
hood, and were placed with the experimental males at age 4 days,
for 4 h. Eggs laid by the ebony females over the next 24 h were
trimmed back to 180 eggs per vial. Wild-type and ebony offspring
were counted. Any wild-type offspring was sired by experimental
wild-type males. We calculated the ratio of number of wild-type
offspring to total offspring number as reproductive performance
(reproductive fitness) measure.
(b) Statistical analysis
(i) Survival
We used mixed Cox proportional hazard models (function coxme,
R package coxme [15]) to test for effects of evolution diet and assay
diet on survival patterns, with a random effect that models the
variation between vials of the same treatment, nested within popu-
lation cage of origin. For model selection, we performed backward
elimination of non-significant fixed effects (at a 0.05 significance
level), using log-likelihood-ratio tests, with twice the difference
in log-likelihoods of the models taken as chi-square distributed.
To further analyse the significant interaction term between evol-
ution diet and assay diet for male survival, we proceeded with
separate analyses on subgroups of the data (with a significance
level of 0.017, after a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing).
For all reported results, diet was treated as a categorical variable.
Lifespan summary statistics and sample sizes are given in
electronic supplementary material, table S2.
(ii) Reproductive performance
We calculated total male reproductive performance per vial as
the sum of the ratios of number of wild-type offspring to total
number of offspring (the sum of the number of ebony and
wild-type offspring), with the value 1 indicating the highest repro-
ductive performance of experimental males and 0 the lowest, and,
accordingly, the value 3 representing the highest value of total
reproductive performance (summed across the three samples,
measured at ages 7, 28 and 56 days of adult life). This represents
the most inclusive reproductive performance measure for a given
vial population. Effects of evolution diet, assay diet and the inter-
action between evolution diet and assay diet on reproductive
fitness were tested in linear-mixed models, with the variable
‘cage’ fitted as a random intercept (using function lmer in R pack-
age lme4 [16]). We used the R package lmertest to calculate
p-values for lmer models, with degrees of freedom based on the
Satterthwaite approximation [17]. Model selection was performed
with the same rationale as for survival analyses. To further
( post hoc) analyse the significant effect of evolution diet, we used
the function difflsmeans in package lmerTest (see electronic
supplementary material, table S3).
3. Results
Here, we report effects of experimental evolution under DR,
standard and enriched adult diets, on male survival and
reproduction. In the full model for male survival, the inter-
action between evolution diet and assay diet was significant
(evolution diet  assay diet, x2 ¼ 14.72, d.f. ¼ 4, p ¼ 0.005).
Because the main point of interest was the effect of evolution
diet on survival, we proceeded to test the evolution diet
effects in separate analyses for assay diet. All initial models
contained evolution diet as a main effect, and were tested
against null models of no treatment effect. Evolution diet
had no effect on male survival in any of the assay diet
groups (figure 1; likelihood-ratio tests between mixed Cox
proportional hazards models: DR assay diet: x2 ¼ 4.39,
d.f. ¼ 1, p ¼ 0.111; standard assay diet: x2 ¼ 4.03, d.f. ¼ 1,
p ¼ 0.133; high assay diet: x2 ¼ 2.72, d.f. ¼ 1, p ¼ 0.257).
Assay diet, on the other hand, had the classic DR effect
in all evolution diet groups, with a negative relation-
ship between dietary yeast content and survival (tested
separately in each evolution diet group: DR evolution diet:
x2 ¼ 81.64, d.f. ¼ 1, p , 0.001; standard evolution diet: x2 ¼
63.08, d.f. ¼ 1, p , 0.001; high evolution diet: x2 ¼ 57.40,
d.f. ¼ 1,
p , 0.001;

assay diet for survival could be driven by flies from the
high evolution diet living shorter than flies from DR and
standard diet populations on DR assay diet (electronic
supplementary material, figure S1). For male reproductive per-
formance, evolution diet and assay diet had significant effects

assay diet were independent of each other (evolution diet 
assay diet, tested in full model: x2 ¼ 0.76, d.f. ¼ 4, p ¼ 0.951).
Males from DR populations had the highest reproductive per-
formance on all tested assay diets, compared with males from
standard and high-diet populations (figure 2; electronic sup-
plementary material, table S3). Males evolved on ancestral
diet showed the expected clear positive relationship between
dietary yeast content and reproductive performance.
4. Discussion
How diet (and especially how DR) affects lifespan, reproduc-
tion and other fitness traits has been the focus of some
theoretical [18,19] and of a large number of empirical studies
(reviewed in [4,20]). A reallocation of resources from reproduc-
tion towards somatic maintenance and repair is the underlying
mechanism commonly used to explain extended lifespan and
reduced reproduction under DR [21]. If a DR-induced negative
correlation between reproduction and survival is based on the
reallocation of resources, and if it is adaptive as a way to over-
come short periods of reduced resource availability, chronic
DR should select for increased reproduction with a concomi-
tant reduction in survival, compared with the levels observed
under short-term DR. Our results do not support this scenario.
While male reproductive performance was higher in the DR
evolution populations, as predicted, survival rates were not
affected significantly by evolution diet.
While this study is the first to indirectly test the reallocation
hypothesis for DR effects using experimental evolution,
empirical evidence against an obligatory tight negative cor-
relation
between
reproduction
and
survival,
based
on
reallocation of resources, has come from a number of studies
in recent years. In female D. melanogaster, Mair et al. [22]
showed that ovaries and hence the ability to produce eggs
were not necessary to elicit lifespan extension under DR.
Grandison et al. [23] showed that fecundity in female flies
under DR could be increased to levels observed under stan-
dard full feeding diet conditions by adding one specific
amino acid (methionine) to DR diet. While fecundity was
increased on methionine supplemented DR diet, the typical
DR effect of lifespan extension was still observed. In the
neriid fly Telostylinus angusticollis [24], adult DR diet in males
did not reduce the fecundity or egg-to-adult viability of eggs
laid by females mated to DR males. If the DR effects were
based on an obligatory trade-off between male reproduction
and survival through a reallocation of resources from repro-
duction to survival, males would be predicted to show
decreased reproductive potential, which was not the case.
Two other good examples that do not directly support the
reallocation hypothesis of DR effects come from a study on
olfaction [25] and from a study on nutrient tracking [26], both
in D. melanogaster. Libert et al. [25] showed that the smell of
nutrient-rich food alone is sufficient to reverse the lifespan-
extending effect of DR to a substantial degree, without
having more dietary resources available for reproduction.
This clearly shows that lifespan can be regulated indepen-
dently of direct allocation of resources into reproduction
under some circumstances. O’Brien et al. [26] marked nitrogen
and carbon in dietary yeast with different stable isotopes and
traced their allocation to either eggs or somatic tissue after
ingestion. Absolute investment of marked nutrients into
somatic tissue was smaller in DR females, compared with stan-
dard diet females. Therefore, longer lifespan of DR females
seems not to be caused by greater absolute investment into
somatic tissue. However, DR females invested relatively
more resources into somatic tissue than into eggs, compared
with standard diet females. The authors suggest that rather
than absolute resource investment into somatic tissue and
longer survival, it is this higher ratio between investment into
the soma and into eggs that is causing extended lifespan under
DR. In this interpretation, greater investment in soma and
repair offsets damage through reproduction, leading to
longer lifespan, and resource reallocation is still the underlying
mechanism. Our selection regime could have resulted in the
evolution of fitter males under DR by reducing mutation
load in the population [27]. For example, DR males could
have evolved to become more efficient at extracting and/or
converting nutrients into energy. Because DR males have
higher fitness, they could be investing relatively more in
reproduction, as predicted by resource reallocation theory.
Do our results support the model for the evolutionary basis
of DR brought forward by Adler & Bonduriansky [5]? These

authors assign autophagy and apoptosis a pivotal role in
explaining the DReffect on longevity, with autophagy probably
being the more important and prominent process [28] in largely
post-mitotic tissues (but see [29]) of adult D. melanogaster.
In fully fed animals, levels of this cellular degradation and
recycling machinery are comparatively low, whereas nutrient-
sensing
pathways,
for
example
IIS
(insulin/Insulin-like
growth factor 1 signalling) and target of rapamycin (TOR),
are upregulated to promote cellular growth. In contrast, when
resources are scarce, autophagy and apoptosis, which are con-
trolled to a large degree by IIS/TOR signalling [30], are
upregulated to more efficiently re-use internally available
resources (organelles and long-lived proteins [31]), whereas
nutrient-sensing pathways are less active. Our results of a gen-
erally higher reproductive fitness of DR evolution diet males
could be explained by selection for more efficient autophagy,
leading to optimal use of available resources. These resources,
however, are allocated to reproduction while survival does
not increase much, thus contradicting the hypothesis that life-
span extension under DR is a by-product of scavenging for
internal resources to increase reproduction [5].
If heightened levels of autophagy have positive fitness con-
sequences, such as the observed beneficial effect on male
reproductive performance, why would we not observe the
evolution of higher or more efficient autophagy levels in nutri-
ent-rich environments? This may be explained by trade-offs
which are masked in a benign laboratory environment. When
autophagy is induced directly by upregulation of Autophagy-
specific gene 1 (Atg1), cell death is also induced [32]. Even
thoughcelldeath and organismal death are not necessarily posi-
tively correlated, additional stressors such as high pathogen
load, temperature fluctuations or higher activity levels, experi-
enced under more natural conditions, might trigger a decrease
in survival. Another explanation involves a cost for the other
sex. While most prominent in the fat body of D. melanogaster,
autophagy has recently been shown to also be upregulated in
ovaries under starvation [33]. Even with normal nutrient
intake, autophagy is a necessary process in follicle cells during
oogenesis, but it is not required for germline development
[33]. Therefore, altered levels of autophagy could have sex-
specific effects, with negative effects that only manifest in
females potentially affecting egg production. The main apopto-
sis regulatory pathway p53 is also able to regulate autophagy
[34] and has been shown to act in a sex-specific way on lifespan
in D. melanogaster, with negative effects in females and positive
effects in males [35], which gives tentative support to a possible
sexually antagonistic effect of elevated autophagy levels and
may explain increased male fitness that we observe in lines evol-
ving under DR. Data on the evolution of female lifespan and
reproductive fitness in our experimental evolution populations
are forthcoming and will shed more light on this aspect.
Overall, evolution under sustained DR did not result in
strong effects on male survival patterns, but if anything,
males evolved on DR diet had higher, and not lower, survival
compared with males evolving on higher diets. Importantly,
this lack of response was observed despite ample additive
genetic variation for lifespan segregating in the base popu-
lation [36].
Competitive reproduction,
in contrast,
was
highest in males from DR lines. The absence of an evolution-
ary decrease in lifespan in males from populations evolving
under DR in the face of increased reproductive performance
gives no direct support for the reallocation theory of DR.
However, our results do suggest that sustained DR increases
the strength of selection leading to the evolution of increased
male fitness across a wide range of dietary conditions. Thus,
it is possible that evolution under sustained DR selected
for fitter males that allocate relatively more resources to
reproduction, as predicted by resource reallocation theory.
Whether this male fitness advantage in populations evolved
under sustained DR is offset by disadvantages in females is
under investigation in our laboratory.
