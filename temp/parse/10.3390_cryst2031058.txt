Abstract: The crystal and molecular structures of two 2-aminothiophene derivatives, 
potential allosteric enhancers at the human A1 adenosine receptor, are reported.  
(2-Amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-benzothiophen-3-yl)(phenyl)methanone (1) crystallizes in 
the orthorhombic space group Pna21 (a = 9.2080(4) Å, b = 14.0485(7) Å, c = 10.3826(6) Å), 
and (2-amino-5-ethylthiophen-3-yl)(2-chlorophenyl)methanone (2) crystalizes in the 
monoclinic P21/c space group with unit cell parameters a = 10.6092(8) Å, b = 10.8355(8) Å,  
c = 11.1346(9) Å, β = 98.643(6)Å. In both molecules the intramolecular N–H···O=C 
hydrogen bonds close six-membered planar rings and significantly influence the molecular 
conformation. Intermolecular N–H···O bonds connect the molecules in infinite chains along 
a in case of 1, and along b in 2; in each case the appropriate unit cell axis is approximately 
10 Å long.

1. Introduction 
2-Aminothiophene derivatives have been used in a number of applications in pesticides, dyes and 
pharmaceuticals. The synthesis and properties of these compounds were reviewed in 1999 by  
Sabinis et al. [1] and more recently by Puterová et al. [2]. In particular, substituted 2-aminothiophenes 
with alkyl or cycloalkyl substituents in positions 4 and 5 (see Scheme 1), and aroyl group in position 3 
are active as allosteric enhancers at the human A1 adenosine receptor [3–5]. According to these results, 
the 2-amino and 3-keto groups are necessary for the biological action, and the substituents at position 4 
can further increase the activity.

Interestingly, in the Cambridge Structural Database [6] there is only one example of a 2-amino-3-
aroyl thiophene, (2-amino-7-(trifluoromethyl)-8H-indeno[2,1-b]thiophen-3-yl)(phenyl)methanone [7]. 
As expected from the first reports of the activity of 2-amino-3-benzoyl thiophenes [8], the 
intramolecular N–H···O hydrogen bond creates an additional ring, roughly coplanar with the thiophene 
ring. Here, we present the results of the X-ray crystal structure analysis of two more compounds of this 
family (Scheme 2), namely (2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-benzothiophen-3-yl)(phenyl)methanone (1) 
and (2-amino-5-ethylthiophen-3-yl)(2-chlorophenyl)methanone (2).

Table 1 lists some relevant geometrical features. The overall conformation of the molecules can be 
described by dihedral angles between the approximately planar fragments: thiophene ring (A),  
C–C(=O)–C bridge (B) and phenyl ring (C). The presence of the fused ring (tetrahydro) in 1 influences 
the shape of the molecule; in this case the C3–C10–C11 bridge makes significant dihedral angles with 
both thiophene and phenyl ring plane (20.02(12)° and 46.47(11)°, respectively). The twist between the 
ring planes is 57.77(8)°. On the other hand, in 2 the central bridge is almost coplanar with the 
thiophene ring plane (dihedral angle is only 2.31(12)° and the largest deviation from the plane through 
all 9 atoms, including N2, C10, O10 and C11, is 0.0163(9) Å), but this plane is practically 
perpendicular to the phenyl ring (81.67(5)°). The non-aromatic six membered ring in 1 assumes almost 
ideal half-chair conformation, the asymmetry parameter [10], which describes the deviation from the 
ideal symmetry (in this case C2) is as small as 1.63°.

The intramolecular N–H···O hydrogen bond (cf. Table 2) in both molecules closes an almost planar 
six-membered ring. Such hydrogen bonds exist in virtually all examples from the CSD; in 29 
structures with thiophene ring and amino (NHR or NH2) group ortho to the R–C=O group the only 
example without such bond is one end of tetraethyl 2,2'-(2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxine-5,7-
diylbis(methylylidenenitrilo))bis(5-aminothiophene-3,4-dicarboxylate) tetrahydrofuran solvate [11].

Although solid-state findings do not always translate into non-crystalline environments, the 
supposition that the presence of such a bond is important for the biological activity [8]  
seems to be obvious.

Interestingly, this hydrogen-bonded ring is almost ideally planar in 2 (largest deviation 0.016(10) Å, 
dihedral angle with thiophene ring plane 0.7(5)°), while the deviations are significant in 1 (appropriate 
values are 0.112(8) Å and 4.1(9)°).  
In both molecules the second hydrogen atom from the NH2 group is involved in a relatively short 
and linear intermolecular hydrogen bond with the O10 atom. These bonds connect molecules in 
infinite chains along x in 1 (Figure 3) and along y in 2 (Figure 4).

In 2, the chains are connected by a number of weak but directional C–H···Cl interactions (Figure 5);  
in contrast 1 is a rare example of a structure without any short intermolecular contacts other than  
well-defined, “classical” hydrogen bonds.

and C–H···Cl contacts are shown as dashed lines.  
 
In the case of 2, the structures from the room temperature and 100 K data can be compared, and it 
turns out that the unit cell b parameter (i.e., along the hydrogen-bonded chain) does almost not change

with temperature and the shrinking of the unit cell volume is almost exclusively caused by the 
shortening of the c unit cell parameter, the direction without any significant intermolecular interactions.

Melting points: 373 K for 1, 368 K for 2. 
The crystals appropriate for X-ray data collection were grown from 2-butanone solutions by slow 
evaporation. X-ray diffraction data for 1 and 2 were collected at room temperature using the ω-scan 
technique on an Agilent Technologies four-circle diffractometer equipped with Eos CCD-detector [13] 
using graphite-monochromatized MoKα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å), and additionally for 2—due to the 
relatively low quality of room-temperature data—at 130(1) K on an Agilent SuperNova four-circle 
diffractometer equipped with Atlas CCD-detector [13] using mirror-monochromatized CuKα radiation 
from high-flux micro-focus source (λ = 1.54178 Å). The data were corrected for Lorentz-polarization 
effects as well as for absorption [13]. Accurate unit-cell parameters were determined by a least-squares 
fit of 1187 (1), 1335 (2, rt) and 3736 (2, 130 K) reflections of highest intensity, chosen from the whole 
experiment. The calculations were mainly performed with the WinGX program system [14]. The 
structures were solved with SIR92 [15] and refined with the full-matrix least-squares procedure on  
F2 by SHELXL97 [9]. Scattering factors incorporated in SHELXL97 were used. The function  
w(Fo2 − Fc2)2 was minimized, with w−1 = [2(Fo)2 + (A·P)2 + B·P], where P = [Max (Fo
2, 0) + 
2Fc
2]/3. The final values of A and B are listed in Table 1. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined 
anisotropically, all hydrogen atoms in 2 (130 K) and amino hydrogens in 1 were found in difference 
Fourier maps and isotropically refined; other hydrogen atoms in 1 were placed in calculated positions 
and were refined as ‘riding’ on their parent atoms; the Uiso’s of hydrogen atoms were set as 1.2 times 
the Ueq value of the appropriate carrier atom. Relevant crystal data are listed in Table 3, together with 
refinement details.

4. Conclusions  
The crystal structures of two 2-amino-3-aroyl thiophenes, potential allosteric enhancers at the 
human A1 adenosine receptor, were determined by means of X-ray diffraction. In both molecules, 
intramolecular N–H···O hydrogen bonds close approximately planar six-membered rings, roughly (in 
case of 1) or almost perfectly (2) coplanar with the thiophene ring plane. The intermolecular N–H···O 
hydrogen bonds connect molecules in infinite chains along the approximately 10 Å long unit  
cell axis.
