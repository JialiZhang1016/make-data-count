Abstract
14
Over the 180 million years since their origin, the sex chromosomes of mammals have evolved a gene reper-
15
toire highly specialized for function in the male germline. The mouse Y chromosome is unique among mam-
16
malian Y chromosomes characterized to date in that it is large, gene-rich and euchromatic. Yet little is known
17
about its diversity in natural populations. Here we take advantage of published whole-genome sequencing
18
data to survey the diversity of sequence and copy number of sex-linked genes in three subspecies of house
19
mice. Copy number of genes on the repetitive long arm of both sex chromosomes is highly variable, but se-
20
quence diversity in non-repetitive regions is decreased relative to expectations based on autosomes. We use
21
simulations and theory to show that this reduction in sex-linked diversity is incompatible with neutral demo-
22
graphic processes alone, but is consistent with recent positive selection on genes active during spermatogenesis.
23
Our results support the hypothesis that the mouse sex chromosomes are engaged in ongoing intragenomic con-
24
ﬂict.

Introduction
28
Sex chromosomes have emerged many times in independent plant and animal lineages. The placental mam-
29
mals share a sex chromosome pair that originated approximately 180 million years ago (Mya) (Hughes and
30
Page 2015). In the vast majority of mammal species, the Y chromosome is sex-determining: presence of the
31
Y-encoded protein SRY is sufﬁcient to initiate the male developmental program (Berta et al. 1990). Since their
32
divergence from the ancestral X chromosome, mammalian Y chromosomes have lost nearly all of their ancestral
33
gene content (Figure 1A). Although these losses have occurred independently along different lineages within
34
the mammals, the small subset of genes that are retained in each linage tend to be dosage-sensitive and have
35
housekeeping functions in core cellular processes such as transcription and protein degradation (Bellott et al.
36
2014; Cortez et al. 2014). Contrary to bold predictions that the mammalian Y chromosome is bound for extinc-
37
tion (Graves 2006), empirical studies of Y chromosomes have demonstrated that most gene loss occurs in early
38
proto-sex chromosomes, and that the relatively old sex chromosomes of mammals are more stable (Bellott et al.
39
2014). The evolutionary diversity of Y chromosomes in mammals arises from the set of Y-acquired genes, which
40
make up a small fraction of some Y chromosomes and a much larger fraction in others — from 5% in rhesus
41
to 45% in human (Hughes and Page 2015) (Figure 1B). These genes are often present in many copies and are
42
highly specialized for function in the male germline (Lahn and Page 1997; Soh et al. 2014).
43
The Y chromosome of the house mouse (Mus musculus) stands out among mammalian Y chromosomes
44
both for its sheer size and its unusual gene repertoire. Early molecular studies of the mouse Y chromosome

Figure 1: Evolution of mammalian Y chromosomes. (A) Evolution of heteromorphic sex chromosomes. (B)
Y chromosomes of mammals. The Y chromosome of therian mammals, characterized by the sex-determining
factor SRY, diverged from the X chromosome approximately 180 Mya. (The monotremata have a different sex-
determining factor, AMH, and an idiosyncratic ﬁve-pair sex chromosome system.) Y chromosome sizes and the
fraction of sequence occupied by multicopy, Y-acquired genes are shown at the tips of the tree. (C) Structure of the
Y chromosome in the C57BL/6J reference strain. The short arm of the Y chromosome (Yq) consists primarily of
genes shared with the X chromosome and retained since the sex chromosomes diverged from the ancestral auto-
some pair. These genes are interspersed with blocks of segmental duplications (light grey). The sex-determining
factor Sry is encoded on the short arm. The long arm (Yq) consists of approximately 200 copies of a 500 kb repeat-
ing unit containing the acquired genes Sly, Ssty1, Ssty2 and Srsy. The sequence in the repeat unit can be roughly
divided into three families “red,” “yellow” and “blue” following (Soh et al. 2014). (D) The X choromosome, un-
like the Y chromosome, is acrocentric. Homologs of the acquired genes on the Y chromosome (Slx, Slxl1, Sstx and
Srsx; shown above using colored blocks as on the Y) are present in high copy number but are arranged in tandem
chunks, rather than intermingled as on the Y.
hinted that it consisted of mostly of repetitive sequences, with copy number in the hundreds, and that it was
46
evolving rapidly (Nishioka and Lamothe 1986; Eicher et al. 1989). Unlike other mammalian Y chromosomes,
47
which are dominated by large blocks of heterochromatin (Hughes and Page 2015), the mouse Y chromosome
48
was also known to be large and almost entirely euchromatic. Spontaneous mutations in laboratory stocks
49
allowed the mapping of male-speciﬁc tissue antigens and the sex-determining factor Sry to the short arm of the
50
chromosome (Yp) (McLaren et al. 1988), while lesions on the long arm (Yq) were associated with infertility and
51
defects in spermatogenesis (Styrna et al. 1991; Burgoyne et al. 1992; Touré et al. 2004).
52
Sequencing, assembly and annotation of the mouse Y chromosome in the inbred strain C57BL/6J was ﬁnally
53
completed in 2014 after more than a decade of painstaking effort (Soh et al. 2014). Ancestral genes are restricted
54
to Yp and are fewer in number on the mouse Y chromosome than in other studied mammals. Yq was shown

to consist of approximately 200 copies of a 500 kb unit — the “huge repeat array” — containing the acquired
56
genes Sly, Ssty1, Ssty2 and Srsy (Figure 1C). Sly and its X-linked homologs Slx and Slxl1 are found only in
57
the genus Mus and have sequence similarity to the synaptonemal complex protein SYCP3 (Ellis et al. 2011).
58
Ssty1/2 and Sstx are most similar to members of the spindlin family (Oh et al. 1997) and are present in taxa
59
at least as phylogenetically distant as rats. The coding potential of Srsy and Srsx is unclear, but they have
60
sequence similarity to melanoma-related cancer/testis antigens typiﬁed by the human MAGEA family. Their
61
phylogenetic origins remain unresolved. The genes of the huge repeat array are expressed almost exclusively
62
in post-meiotic round spermatids and function in chromatin condensation and sperm maturation (Burgoyne
63
et al. 1992; Touré et al. 2004, 2005; Yamauchi et al. 2009, 2010).
64
Independent ampliﬁcation of homologous genes on the X and Y chromosomes is thought to be a byproduct
65
of competition between the X and Y chromosomes for transmission to the next generation. The current con-
66
sensus favors an unidentiﬁed X-linked sex-ratio distorter whose action is suppressed by one or more Y-linked
67
factors (Ellis et al. 2011). Consistent with this hypothesis, SLY acts directly to maintain transcriptional repres-
68
sion of post-meiotic sex chromatin (PSCR, Hendriksen et al. (1995)) by recruiting a suite of repressive histone
69
marks (Ellis et al. 2005; Cocquet et al. 2009; Moretti et al. 2016); its action is opposed by SLX and SLXL1. Imbal-
70
ance between SLY and SLX/SLXL1 tilts the progeny sex ratio in favor of the overexpressing chromosome and
71
causes defects in sperm morphology and sperm count (Touré et al. 2004; Cocquet et al. 2009, 2010). Disruption
72
of PSCR and the related process of meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) is also associated with male
73
sterility in inter-subspeciﬁc hybrids between M. m. domesticus and M. m. musculus (Good et al. 2010; Campbell
74
et al. 2013; Bhattacharyya et al. 2013; Larson et al. 2016a). Together these observations suggest that the intrage-
75
nomic conﬂict between the sex chromosomes in mouse is played out in post-meiotic spermatids and may have
76
mechanistic overlap with hybrid male sterility.
77
Intragenomic conﬂict can have a profound impact on the genetic diversity of sex chromosomes in natural
78
populations. Sex-ratio-distorter systems in Drosophila provide some of the best-known examples (Jaenike 2001;
79
Derome et al. 2004; Kingan et al. 2010). The extent to which diversity on mouse sex chromosomes is inﬂuenced
80
by intragenomic conﬂict remains an open question. The differential impact of selection on mouse X chromo-
81
some versus autosomes (the “faster-X” effect) is well-studied, mostly through the lens of speciation (Torgerson
82
and Singh 2003; Kousathanas et al. 2014; Larson et al. 2016a,b). Larson et al. (2016b) used pairwise comparisons
83
between wild-derived strains of M. m. musculus and M. m. domesticus to show that the “faster-X” effect is most
84
prominent in two groups of genes: those expressed primarily in the testis and early in spermatogenesis (before
85
MSCI), and those up-regulated in spermatids (after PSCR). The former set of genes is also prone to aberrant
86
expression in sterile hybrids Larson et al. (2016a). By contrast, selective pressures imposed by intragenomic
87
conﬂict between the sex chromosomes should be exerted in spermatids after the onset of PSCR. Genes with

spermatid-speciﬁc expression are expected to respond most rapidly, while those with broad expression are
89
expected to be constrained by putative functional requirements in other tissues or cell types.
90
In this manuscript we take advantage of the relatively recent high-quality assembly of the mouse Y chro-
91
mosome (Soh et al. 2014) and public sequencing data from a diverse sample of wild mice to perform a survey
92
of sequence and copy-number diversity on the sex chromosomes. We use complementary gene-expression
93
data and annotations to partition the analysis into functionally-coherent groups of loci. We ﬁnd that sequence
94
diversity is markedly reduced on both the X and Y chromosomes relative to expectations for a stationary pop-
95
ulation. This reduction cannot be fully explained by any of several demographic models ﬁt to autosomal data,
96
but Y-linked diversity in M. m. domesticus is consistent with a recent selective sweep on Y chromosomes. Copy
97
number of genes expressed in spermatids supports the hypothesis that intragenomic conﬂict between the sex
98
chromosomes during spermiogenesis is an important selective pressure. These analyses broaden our under-
99
standing of the evolution of sex chromosomes in murid rodents and support an important role for positive
100
selection in the male germline.

Results
102
A survey of Y-linked coding variation in mouse
103
Whole-genome or whole-exome sequence data for 91 male mice was collected from published sources (Keane
104
et al. 2011; Doran et al. 2016; Harr et al. 2016; Morgan et al. 2016a; Neme and Tautz 2016; Sarver et al. 2017).
105
The ﬁnal set consists of 62 wild-caught mice; 21 classical inbred strains; and 8 wild-derived inbred strains
106
(Table 1 and Table S1). The three cardinal subspecies of M. musculus (domesticus, musculus and castaneus) are all
107
represented, with Mus spretus and Mus spicilegus as close outgroups and Mus caroli, Mus cookii, and Nannomys
108
minutoides as more distant outgroups. Our sample spans the native geographic range of the house mouse and
109
its sister taxa (Figure 2A).
110
Single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small indels were ascertained in 41.6 kb of sequence on Yp targeted
111
by the Roche NimbleGen exome-capture array. To mitigate the effect of alignment errors and cryptic copy-
112
number variation on our analyses, we discarded sites with evidence heterozygosity; fewer than 60 samples
113
with a called genotype; or evidence of strand bias (see Materials and methods). In total we identiﬁed 1, 136
114
SNVs and 128 indels, with transition:tranversion ratio 2.1.
115
One group of inbred strains in our dataset — C57BL/6J (reference genome), C57BL/10J, C57L/J and C57BR/cdJ
116
— have a known common ancestor in the year 1929, and a common ancestor with the strain C58/J in 1915
117
(Beck et al. 2000). Assuming an average of three generations per year, the total branch length of the pedi-
118
gree connecting the C57 and C58 strains is 5, 280 generations, during which time 3 mutations occurred. We

used these values to obtain a direct estimate of the male-speciﬁc point mutation rate: 1.8 × 10−8 (95% Pois-
120
son CI 4.5 × 10−9 −4.7 × 10−8) bp-1 generation-1. This interval contains the sex-averaged autosomal rate of
121
5.4×10−9 bp-1 generation-1 recently estimated from whole-genome sequencing of mutation-accumulation lines
122
(Uchimura et al. 2015). Using the ratio between paternal to maternal mutations in mouse estimated in clas-
123
sic studies from Russell and colleagues (2.78; reviewed in Drost and Lee (1995)), that estimate corresponds to
124
male-speciﬁc autosomal rate of 7.9 × 10−9 bp-1 generation-1, again within our conﬁdence interval. We note that
125
these estimates assume that selection has been negligible in laboratory colonies.
126
Phylogeny of Y chromosomes recovers geographic relationships
127
Phylogenetic trees for exonic regions of the Y chromosome and mitochondrial genome were constructed with
128
BEAST (Figure 2B). The estimated time to most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of M. musculus Y chromo-
129
somes is 900, 000 years ago (95% highest posterior density interval [HPDI] 100, 000 −1, 800, 000) years ago.
130
Within M. musculus, the domesticus subspecies diverges ﬁrst, although the internal branch separating it from the
131
MRCA of musculus and castaneus is very short. Consistent with several previous studies, we ﬁnd that the “old”
132
classical inbred strains share a single Y haplogroup within M. m. musculus. This haplogroup is distinct from
133
that of European and central Asian wild mice and is probably of east Asian origin (Bishop et al. 1985; Tucker
134
et al. 1992; Nagamine et al. 1992). Strains related to “Swiss” outbred stocks (FVB/NJ, NOD/ShiLtJ, HR8) and
135
those of less certain American origin (AKR/J, BUB/BnJ) (Beck et al. 2000) have Y chromosomes with afﬁnity

to western European populations. M. m. castaneus harbors two distinct and paraphyletic lineages: one corre-
137
sponding to the Indian subcontinent and another represented only by the wild-derived inbred strain CAST/EiJ
138
(from Thailand). The latter haplogroup corresponds to a southeast Asian lineage identiﬁed in previous reports
139
that sampled more extensively from that geographic region (Geraldes et al. 2008; Yang et al. 2011). It remains
140
unclear whether this haplogroup originated in M. m. musculus and displaced the M. m. castaneus Y chromo-
141
some in southeast Asia; or instead represents a deep branching within the (large and unsampled) population
142
ancestral to musculus and castaneus in central Asia.
143
The Y-chromosome tree otherwise shows perfect concordance between clades and geographic locations.
144
Within the M. m. domesticus lineage we can recognize two distinct haplogroups corresponding roughly to west-
145
ern Europe and Iran and the Mediterranean basin, respectively. Similarly, within M. m. musculus, the eastern
146
European mice (from Bavaria, Czech Republic) are well-separated from the central Asian mice (Kazakhstan and
147
Afghanistan). Relationships between geographic origins and phylogenetic afﬁnity are considerably looser for
148
the mitochondrial genome. We even found evidence for inter-speciﬁc hybridization: one nominally M. spretus
149
individual from central Spain (SP36) carries a M. spretus Y chromosome and a M. m. domesticus mitochondrial
150
genome (arrowhead in Figure 2B). Several previous studies have found evidence for introgression between M.
151
musculus and M. spretus where their geographic ranges overlap (Orth et al. 2002; Song et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2015).
152
Copy-number variation is pervasive on the Y chromosome
153
We examined copy number along Yp using depth of coverage. Approximately 779 kb (24%) of Yp consists
154
of segmental duplications or gaps in the reference assembly (Figure 1); for duplicated regions we scaled the
155
normalized read depth by the genomic copy number in the reference sequence to arrive at a ﬁnal copy-number
156
estimate for each individual. All of the known duplications on Yp are polymorphic in laboratory and natural
157
populations (Figure 3A). The distribution of CNV alleles follows the SNV-based phylogenetic tree. Only one
158
CNV region on Yp, adjacent to the centromere, contains a known protein-coding gene (Rbmy). Consistent with
159
a previous report (Ellis et al. 2011), we ﬁnd that musculus Y chromosomes have more copies of Rbmy than
160
domesticus or castaneus chromosomes.
161
The highly repetitive content of Yq precludes a similarly detailed characterization of copy-number variation
162
along this chromosome arm. However, we can estimate the copy number of each of the three gene families
163
present (Sly, Ssty1/2 and Srsy) by counting the total number of reads mapped to each and normalizing for
164
sequencing depth. The hypothesis of X-Y intragenomic conﬂict predicts that, if expression levels are at least
165
roughly proportional to copy number, ampliﬁcation of gene families on Yq should be countered by ampliﬁca-
166
tion of their antagonistic homologs on the X chromosome (or vice versa.) We tested this hypothesis by compar-
167
ing the copy number of X- and Y-linked homologs of the Slx/y, Sstx/y and Srsx/y families in wild mice. Figure 4

shows that copy number on X and Y chromosomes are indeed correlated for Slx/y. The relationship between
169
Slx-family and Sly-family copy number is almost exactly linear (slope = 0.98 [95% CI 0.87 −1.09]; R2 = 0.87).
170
We note that samples are not phylogenetically independent, so the statistical signiﬁcance of the regression is
171
exaggerated, but the qualitative result clearly supports previous evidence that conﬂict between X and Y chro-
172
mosomes is mediated primarily through Slx and Sly (Cocquet et al. 2012). Size differences estimated from Sly
173
copy number are also concordant with cytological observations that the Y chromosomes of wild-caught M. m.
174
musculus appear much larger than those of M. spicilegus or M. spretus (Bulatova and Kotenkova 1990; Yakimenko
175
et al. 1990).
176
It has recently been shown that two regions of the autosomes — on chromosomes 5 and 14 — have a suite
177
of epigenetic marks similar to the sex chromosomes in post-meiotic spermatids (Moretti et al. 2016). These
178
autosomal regions harbor many copies of a family of genes (known alternatively as Speer (Spiess et al. 2003)
179
or α-takusan (Tu et al. 2007)) expressed in spermatids. The copy number of Speer family members is, like Sly,
180
correlated with that of Slx/Slxl1 (Figure S1). This ﬁnding supports the hypothesis that the Speer family may be
181
involved in sex-chromosome conﬂict in spermatids.
182
The scale of copy number change within the M. musculus lineage suggests a high underlying mutation rate.
183
We used whole-genome sequence data from a panel of 69 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from the Collabo-
184
rative Cross (CC; Srivastava et al. (2017)) to estimate the rate of copy-number change on Yq. Each CC line is
185
independently derived from eight inbred founder strains via two generations of outcrossing followed by sib-
186
ling matings until inbreeding is achieved (Consortium 2012). Distinct CC lines inheriting a Y chromosome from
187
the same founder strain thus share an obligate male ancestor in the recent past, but no more recently than the

189
against the median for CC lines inheriting a Y chromosome from the same founder strain. This normalization
190
effectively removes noise from mapping of short reads to repetitive sequence and uncovers CNVs from 6 to 30
191
Mb in size in 5 CC lines carrying 3 different Y chromosomes (Table 2, Table S2 and Figure 5B). Because the
192
pedigree of each CC line is known, mutation rates — for each Y haplogroup, and overall — can be estimated
193
directly, assuming each new allele corresponds to a single mutational event. Our estimate of 0.30 (95% Poisson
194
CI 0.098 −0.70) mutations per 100 father-son transmissions is about tenfold higher than ampliconic regions of
195
the human Y chromosome (Repping et al. 2006), and places the mouse Yq among the most labile sequences
196
known in mouse or human (Egan et al. 2007; Itsara et al. 2010; Morgan et al. 2016b). New Yq alleles also provide
197
opportunities to investigate the effects of Yq copy number on fertility, sperm phenotypes and sex ratio (as in,

Sequence diversity is markedly reduced on both sex chromosomes
201
We next used whole-genome sequence data to examine patterns of nucleotide diversity within Mus musculus
202
in non-repetitive sequence on Yp compared to the autosomes and X chromosome. To do so we ﬁrst identiﬁed a
203
subset of wild mice without evidence of cryptic relatedness (see Materials and methods); this left 20 male and 1
204
female M. m. domesticus (hereafter dom), 9 male and 10 female M. m. musculus (mus) and 3 male and 7 female M.
205
m. castaneus (cas). Analyses of autosomes used both males and females from each population; sex chromosome
206
analyses used males only to avoid introducing technical artifacts associated with differences in sample ploidy.
207
Diversity statistics were calculated from the joint site frequency spectrum (SFS), which in turn was estimated
208
directly from genotype likelihoods rather than hard genotype calls (Korneliussen et al. 2014).
209
We estimated nucleotide diversity in four classes of sites: intergenic sites (putatively neutral); introns; 4-fold
210
degenerate sites; and 0-fold degenerate sites. Putatively neutral sites are useful for estimating demographic
211
parameters, while the latter three classes are useful for assessing the impact of selection. Sites on the sex chro-
212
mosomes are subject to different selective pressures than autosomal sites, both because they are “exposed” in
213
the hemizygous state in males and because, in mammals, the sex chromosomes are enriched for genes with
214
sex-speciﬁc expression patterns. To evaluate these effects we further subdivided genic sites according to gene-
215
expression patterns inferred from two expression datasets, one in eighteen adult tissues and one a time course
216
across spermatogenesis (see Materials and methods). Genes on the autosomes and X chromosome were clas-
217
siﬁed along two independent axes: testis-speciﬁc versus ubiquitously-expressed; or expressed early in meiosis,
218
prior to MSCI, versus expressed in post-meiotic spermatids. (Y chromosome genes are not subdivided, since
219
they are few in number and inherited as a single linkage block.) All diversity estimates are shown in Ta-
220
ble S3. For putatively neutral sites on the autosomes, our estimates of pairwise diversity (πdom = 0.339%,
221
πmus = 0.325%, πcas = 0.875%) are consistent with previous reports based on overlapping samples (Geraldes
222
et al. 2008; Halligan et al. 2013; Kousathanas et al. 2014; Harr et al. 2016). Within each chromosome type, levels
223
of diversity follow the expected rank order: intergenic sites > introns ≈4-fold degenerate (synonymous) sites
224
> 0-fold degenerate (non-synonymous) sites.
225
For the X chromosome, we further examined the relationship between sequence diversity and local se-
226
quence features including recombination rate, X-Y gametologous amplicons, gene sets described above and
227
blocks of conserved synteny with rat (Figure S2). Diversity is reduced across the entire X chromosome in all
228
three populations, in marked contrast to local “troughs” observed in great apes (Nam et al. 2015). Regres-
229
sion of pairwise diversity (θπ) on distance away from ubiquitously-expressed genes, meiosis genes, spermatid
230
genes, and X-Y ampliconic genes was signiﬁcant only in musculus for ubiquitously expressed genes (t = 6.6,
231
Bonferoni-corrected p = 6.8 × 10−11). Similarly — and surprisingly — there was no relationship (t = −1.2,
232
p = 0.23) between sequence diversity and recombination rate at 100 kb resolution, as estimated from the Diver-

234
from linkage disequilibrium (Auton and McVean 2007) would provide a more powerful test.)
235
In a panmictic population with equal effective number of breeding males and breeding females (ie. with
236
equal variance in reproductive success between sexes), there are 3 X chromosomes and a single Y chromosome
237
for every 4 autosomes. The expected ratios of X:A and Y:A diversity are therefore 3/4 and 1/4, respectively, if mu-
238
tation rates in males and females are equal (Charlesworth et al. 1987). We estimated X:A and Y:A for putatively
239
neutral sites and ﬁnd that diversity on both sex chromosomes is markedly reduced relative to expectations in all
240
three populations (Table 3). The effect is strongest in M. m. domesticus (X:A = 0.244, Y:A = 0.0858) and weakest
241
in M. m. musculus (X:A = 0.563, Y:A = 0.216). The mutation rate is higher in the male than the female germline
242
in most mammals (recently reviewed in Scally (2016)), including mice, which might contribute to differences in
243
observed diversity between chromosomes. We used divergence between mouse and rat at synonymous, one-to-
244
one orthologous sites (drat) on autosomes, X and Y chromosome as a proxy for the long-term average mutation
245
rate, and corrected X:A and Y:A estimates for differences in mutation rate (“corrected” rows in Table 3). Even
246
with this correction, X- and Y-linked diversity remains below expectations. Scaled diversity estimates for each
247
class of sites are shown in Figure 6. Reduction in X:A diversity has been described previously on the basis of
248
targeted sequencing of a few loci in all thee subspecies (Baines and Harr 2007), and for M. m. castaneus on the
249
basis of whole-genome sequencing (Halligan et al. 2013; Kousathanas et al. 2014). A reduction in Y:A has not,
250
to our knowledge, been reported.

Reduction in sex-linked diversity is inconsistent with simple demographic models
252
Sex chromosomes are affected differently than autosomes by both neutral forces, such as changes in population
253
size (Pool and Nielsen 2007), and by natural selection (reviewed in eg. Ellegren (2011)). The X chromosomes of
254
humans (Arbiza et al. 2014) and several other primate species (Nam et al. 2015) are substantially less diverse
255
than the demographic histories of these species would predict, as a result of both purifying selection and re-
256
current selective sweeps. For humans, the pattern extends to the Y chromosome (Sayres et al. 2014). Having
257
observed a deﬁcit of polymorphism on both sex chromosomes in mouse, the central question arising in this
258
paper is: to what extent is sex-chromosome diversity reduced by natural selection? A rich body of literature
259
already exists for the inﬂuence of selection on the mouse X chromosome, especially in the context of speciation
260
(Good et al. 2008; Teeter et al. 2008; Baines and Harr 2007; Kousathanas et al. 2014; Larson et al. 2016a,b), so we
261
directed our focus to the lesser-studied Y chromosome.
262
To establish an appropriate null against which to test hypotheses about natural selection on the sex chro-
263
mosomes, we followed an approach similar to Sayres et al. (2014). We ﬁt four simple demographic models
264
to SFS from putatively-neutral intergenic sites on the autosomes using the maximum-likelihood framework
265
implemented in ∂a∂i (Gutenkunst et al. 2009) (Figure 7A). Each model is parameterized by an initial effective
266
population size (N0), a size change (expressed as fraction f of starting size for models involving instantaneous
267
size changes, or the ending population size Ne for the exponential growth models), and a time of onset of size
268
change (τ). The relative ﬁt of each model was quantiﬁed using the method of Aikake weights (Akaike 1978).
269
All four models can be viewed as nested in the family of three-epoch, piecewise-exponential histories. In prin-
270
ciple, such models are identiﬁable with sample size of 4 × 3 = 12 or more chromosomes (6 diploid individuals)
271
(Bhaskar and Song 2014). In practice, more than one model ﬁts each population about equally well (or equally
272
poorly), with the exception of M. m. castaneus , which is best described by the “step-change” model (Figure 7B-
273
C). Of course the true history of each population is almost certainly more complex than any of our models. Our
274
goal is not to obtain a comprehensive description of mouse population history as such, but rather to pick an
275
appropriate null model against which we can test hypotheses about selection. For domesticus, the stationary
276
model is the most parsimonious; for musculus, the exponential-growth model.

We also compared our estimates of sex chromosome diversity to predictions from coalescent theory (Pool
278
and Nielsen 2007; Polanski et al. 2017) for the four models considered above. For this analysis we focused on
279
the ratios X:A and Y:A, which are independent of autosomal effective population size. Results are shown in
280
Figure S3, with observed X:A and Y:A ratios superposed. We summarize some relevant trends here and refer
281
to previous reviews (Pool and Nielsen 2007; Webster and Wilson Sayres 2016) for further details. Qualitatively,
282
both X:A and Y:A are reduced after an instantaneous contraction in population size, eventually recovering to
283
their stationary values after about 4Ne generations. For a bottleneck — a contraction followed by instantaneous
284
recovery to the initial size — X:A and Y:A are at ﬁrst sharply reduced and then increased relative to a stationary
285
population, again returning to stationary values after about 4Ne generations. With exponential growth, X:A
286
and Y:A are actually increased relative to their stationary values. These patterns are modulated by the breeding
287
sex ratio; X:A increases and Y:A decreases when females outnumber males, and vice versa. In brief, some
288
combination of a male-biased breeding ratio and a very strong (f ≪0.1) population contraction would be
289
required to explain the observed reductions in X:A and Y:A in domesticus, with somewhat milder effects required
290
to explain the reduction in musculus or castaneus. These histories are not consistent with population histories
291
inferred from autosomal SFS. We hypothesize that this discrepancy is explained, at least in part, by selection.
292
Both sex chromosomes have been shaped by positive selection in the male germline
293
We used two approaches to investigate the role of selection on the sex chromosomes. First, we used a variant
294
of the McDonald-Kreitman test (McDonald and Kreitman 1991) to obtain a non-parametric estimate of the pro-
295
portion α of sites ﬁxed by positive selection (loosely, the “evolutionary rate”) in genes with different expression
296
and inheritance patterns (Smith and Eyre-Walker 2002). The rate of adaptive evolution should be faster on the
297
X chromosome when new mutations tend to have greater ﬁtness effect in males than in females, to be on aver-
298
age recessive, or both (Charlesworth et al. 1987). We might expect genes with testis-biased expression or genes
299
expressed during spermatogenesis to be targets of male-speciﬁc selection. Consistent with previous work on
300
the “faster-X” effect in mouse (Kousathanas et al. 2014; Larson et al. 2016a,b), we ﬁnd that a greater proportion
301
of X-linked than autosomal substitutions are adaptive. The pattern holds in all three populations (Figure 8). In
302
domesticus and musculus, X-linked genes whose expression is biased towards early meiosis or round spermatids
303
evolve faster than X-linked genes with ubiquitous expression or expression across spermatogenesis. By con-
304
trast, non-ampliconic Y-linked genes — all expressed during male meiosis — have evolutionary rates closer to
305
autosomal genes, with heterogeneity across populations. Unfortunately we cannot assess the rate of sequence
306
evolution in ampliconic gene families on the Y chromosome using short-read data.
307
Second, we used forward simulations from the models ﬁt to autosomal SFS to explore the possible contri-
308
bution of natural selection to the SFS of Y chromosomes. We simulated two modes of selection independently:

purifying selection on linked deleterious alleles (background selection, BGS; (Hudson and Kaplan 1995)), and
310
hard selective sweeps on newly-arising beneﬁcial alleles. For the BGS model, we varied the proportion of sites
311
under selection α and the mean population-scaled selection coefﬁcient γ = N¯s; for the sweep model, we var-
312
ied only the γ for the sweeping allele. (Simulation details are provided in Materials and methods.) Posterior
313
distributions for these parameters were inferred using an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach
314
(Pritchard et al. 1999; Beaumont et al. 2002); Bayes factors were used for model comparison. The castaneus
315
population was excluded from these analyses because sample size (only 3 chromosomes) was not sufﬁcient for
316
calculating some of the summary statistics chosen for ABC.
317
Results of the ABC procedure are shown in Figure S4. The Y chromosomes of domesticus are best approx-
318
imated by the selective-sweep model. For musculus the result is less clear: the neutral null model actually
319
provides the best ﬁt, and among models with selection, the BGS model is superior. However, over the param-
320
eter ranges used in our simulations, we have limited power to discriminate between different models at the
321
current sample size (n ≤20 chromosomes) (Figure S4B). In the best case — the selective-sweep model — we
322
achieve only 49% recall. This reﬂects both the constraints of a small sample and the more fundamental limits
323
on model identiﬁability for a single non-recombining locus like the Y chromosome.
324
If a selective sweep did occur on domesticus Y chromosomes, it was moderately strong: we estimate N¯s =
325
9.29 (50% HPDI 0 −9.88) (Table 5). For comparison, N¯s ≈500 for adaptive alleles in the human lactase gene
326
(LCT), a well-characterized example of recent positive selection (Tishkoff et al. 2007). Posterior distributions of
327
several estimators of nucleotide diversity recapitulate the values observed in real data (Figure S4D). We note
328
that, because the Y chromosome is inherited without recombination, our estimate of N¯s reﬂects the cumulative
329
selection intensity on the entire chromosome and not necessarily on a single site.

Sex-linked gene expression diverges rapidly in the testis
331
Given the dramatic differences in Y-linked gene content between even closely-related Mus taxa, we ﬁnally asked
332
whether patterns of gene expression showed similar divergence. In particular, we sought to test the prediction
333
that expression patterns of Y-linked genes diverge more rapidly than autosomal genes in the testis. To that
334
end we re-analyzed published gene expression data from the brain, liver and testis of wild-derived outbred
335
individuals representing seven (sub)species spanning an 8 million year evolutionary transect across the murid
336
rodents (Neme and Tautz 2016) (Figure 9A). For genes on the autosomes and X chromosome, the great majority
337
of expression variance lies between tissues rather than between (sub)species (PC1 and PC2, cumulative 77.1%
338
of variance explained; Figure 9B). For Y-linked genes, highly enriched for function in the male germline, most
339
variance (PC1, 59.6% of variance explained) naturally lies between the testis and the non-germline tissues.
340
To quantify divergence in gene expression patterns we computed the rank-correlation (Spearman’s ρ) be-
341
tween species for each tissue type separately for autosomal, X-linked and Y-linked genes, and constructed trees
342
by neighbor-joining (Figure 9C). We use total tree length as an estimator of expression divergence. The topology
343
of these trees for the autosomes and X chromosome in brain and testis is consistent with known phylogenetic
344
relationships within the Muridae. Consistent with previous comparative analyses of gene expression in mam-
345
mals (Brawand et al. 2011), we ﬁnd that expression patterns are most constrained in brain and least constrained
346
in testis (Figure 9D). Expression divergence is equal between autosomes and X chromosome in brain and liver,
347
but greater for X-linked genes in testis. Y-linked expression diverges much more rapidly in all three tissues, but
348
the effect is most extreme in the testis. We caution that the precision of these estimates is limited by the small
349
number of Y-linked relative to autosomal or X-linked genes.
350
This “faster-X” effect should be limited to functional elements subject to male-speciﬁc selection. Genes
351
expressed in the male germline (testis-biased and/or expressed during spermatogenesis) might be enriched
352
for such elements, relative to genes with ubiquitous expression. We therefore estimated expression divergence
353
in autosomal, X- and Y-linked genes with four sets of genes with different expression patterns (Figure 9E).
354
X-linked expression diverges more rapidly than autosomal expression only among genes with testis-biased

expression. In contrast to Larson et al. (2016b) but in keeping with other predictions (Good and Nachman
356
2005), we ﬁnd that the “faster-X” effect on expression is larger for genes expressed late than early in meiosis
357
(Figure 9F). The number of Y-linked genes in each group is too small to permit any strong conclusions.
358
Discussion
359
We have shown that nucleotide diversity in M. musculus is reduced on both sex chromosomes relative to expec-
360
tations for a stationary population, and that the effect appears strongest in M. m. domesticus and weakest in M.
361
m. musculus (Table 3). Sex differences in the long-term average mutation rate, estimated from synonymous-sites
362
divergence to rat, are not sufﬁcient to explain the deﬁcit. Because sex chromosomes respond differently than
363
autosomes to changes in population size, we ﬁt several (simple) models of demographic history to autosomal
364
site-frequency spectra (Figure 7) and compared their predictions to observed values. At least for the models we
365
considered (see Supplement), neither gradual nor instantaneous changes in population size — of magnitude
366
feasible given autosomal SFS — can account for the reduction in diversity on both the X and Y chromosomes,
367
even if we allow for a sex ratio different than 1:1 (Figure S3). Estimates of effective size of each population
368
(from autosomal sites) are in agreement with previous work on house mice (Din et al. 1996; Baines and Harr
369
2007; Salcedo et al. 2007; Geraldes et al. 2008).
370
Using demographic histories from autosomes as a baseline, we simulated two modes of selection — back-
371
ground selection and hard selective sweeps — on Y chromosomes of domesticus and musculus. Although dis-
372
crimination between models was limited by both technical factors and theoretical constraints, we have shown
373
that the Y-linked SFS in domesticus is consistent with a moderately strong selective sweep (Figure S4). The
374
background selection model is the best-ﬁtting in musculus, but is only 1.4-fold more likely (log10 BF = 0.16)
375
than the next-best model. We conclude that recent positive selection accounts, at least in part, for the reduc-
376
tion in Y-linked relative to autosomal diversity in domesticus. Furthermore, coding sequences of X-linked genes
377
with germline expression are disproportionately shaped by positive selection (Figure 8). Both X- and Y-linked
378
genes have rapidly-diverging expression patterns in the testis, especially in spermatids (Figure 9). Together
379
these ﬁndings provide strong support for the idea that positive selection in the male germline is a potent and
380
ongoing force shaping both mammalian sex chromosomes (Mueller et al. 2013; Larson et al. 2016b).
381
To what extent are these pressures a consequence of intragenomic conﬂict? The reciprocal actions of SLX/SLX1
382
and SLY on sex-linked gene expression in spermatids establish the conditions for conﬂict between the X and Y
383
chromosomes that implicates any gene whose expression after meiosis is beneﬁcial for sperm maturation and
384
fertilizing ability. X-linked alleles that meet the functional requirement for post-meiotic expression in the face
385
of repression by SLY — via a stronger promoter, a more stable transcript, a more active protein product, or
386
increased copy number — should be favored by selection (Ellis et al. 2011). The same should be true, in reverse,

for successful Y chromosomes.
388
Although we cannot directly identify the putative target(s) or meccanism(s) of selective sweeps on the Y
389
chromosome, several independent lines of evidence point to the ampliconic genes on Yq active in the X-Y
390
conﬂict. First, the copy number of Slx/Slxl1 and Sly have increased three-fold within M. musculus and are
391
correlated across populations (Figure 4), consistent with an “arms race” between the sex chromosomes in which
392
the Y chromosome is the lagging player. The absolute expression of ampliconic X genes and their Yq homologs
393
(in whole testis) increases with copy number across Mus (Figure S5). Larson et al. (2016a) have shown that,
394
in spermatids from reciprocal F1 hybrids between domesticus and musculus that are “mismatched” for Slx/Slxl1
395
and Sly, global X-chromosome expression is indeed perturbed in the direction predicted by the copy number
396
and actions of SLX/SLX1 and SLY. Second, several independent deletions of Yq in laboratory stocks converge
397
on a similar phenotype, namely low fertility, abnormal sperm morphology due to problems with chromatin
398
compaction, and sex-ratio distortion in favor of females (Styrna et al. 1991; Conway et al. 1994; Touré et al. 2004;
399
Fischer et al. 2016; MacBride et al. 2017). Third, Y chromosomes from musculus — the subspecies with highest
400
Sly copy number — are more successful at introgressing across domesticus-musculus hybrid zone in Europe, and
401
in localities where they do, the census sex ratio is shifted towards males (Macholán et al. 2008). Consomic
402
strains with differing only by their Y chromosomes show similar deviation in the sex ratio from parity (Case
403
et al. 2015). Finally, although modeling predicts moderately strong positive selection on Y, there is little evidence
404
that it occurs within coding sequences of single-copy genes on Yp (Figure 8). This observation permits several
405
explanations but is consistent with the idea that Yp alleles are hitchhiking with favorable alleles on Yq.
406
It is more difﬁcult to ascertain the contribution of intragenomic conﬂict to the paucity of diversity on the
407
X chromosome. Although the mammalian X chromosome is enriched for genes with expression in the male
408
germline (eg. Rice (1984); Mueller et al. (2013)), its functional portfolio is considerably more broad than that
409
of the Y chromosome (Bellott et al. 2014, 2017). The X chromosome also has a major role in hybrid sterility in
410
mouse (Forejt and Iványi 1974; Forejt 1996; Storchová et al. 2004; Payseur et al. 2004; Teeter et al. 2008; Good et al.
411
2008; Campbell et al. 2013; Turner et al. 2014); the Y chromosome does not (Turner et al. 2012; Campbell and
412
Nachman 2014). We corroborate the “faster-X” effect on protein evolution that has been previously described
413
by others (Kousathanas et al. 2014; Larson et al. 2016b) and show that it is strongest for genes expressed in
414
the male germline (Figure 8), which are widely scattered across the X chromosome (Figure S2D). We conclude
415
that selection is pervasive on the mouse X chromosome and reduces diversity chromosome-wide. This stands
416
in contrast to the pattern observed in great apes, which has apparently been driven by a few strong selective
417
sweeps (Hvilsom et al. 2012; Veeramah et al. 2014; Nam et al. 2015).
418
Many open questions remain with respect to the evolution of mouse Y chromosomes. How many of the
419
hundreds of copies in each gene family retain coding potential? Which copies are functionally equivalent? Does

Does the conﬂict lead to oscillations between a male-biased and female-biased population over time, and if so,

what is the effect on patterns of diversity on the sex chromosomes? All of these are important avenues of future

study as we seek to understand the forces shaping sex chromosomes.

432
analyses. Regions of the Y chromosome accessible for variant calling were identiﬁed using the CallableLoci
433
tool in the GATK v3.3-0-g37228af (McKenna et al. 2010). To be declared “callable” within a single sample, sites
434
were required to have depth consistent with a single haploid copy (3 < depth < 50) and < 25% of overlapping
435
reads having mapping quality (MQ) zero. The analysis was restricted to Yp. The ﬁnal set of callable sites was
436
deﬁned as any site counted as callable within > 10 samples. In total, 2 289 336 bp (77% of the non-gap length of
437
Yp) were deemed callable.

SNVs and short indels on the Y chromosome were ascertained using GATK HaplotypeCaller v3.3-0-

443
with a “homozygous” (ie. single-copy hemizygous) call in all male samples were used. Sites called in fewer

Estimation of site frequency spectra and summary statistics
450
Site frequency spectra (SFS) were calculated from genotype likelihoods at callable sites using ANGSD v0.917 (Ko-
451
rneliussen et al. 2014). Genotype likelihoods for the autosomes were caculated under the GATK diploid model
452
after applying base alignment quality (BAQ) recalibration with the recommended settings for bwa alignments
453
(-baq 1 -c 50, effectively discarding evidence from reads aligning at < 95% identity). Sites were ﬁltered
454
to have per-individual coverage consistent with the presence of a single diploid copy (3 < depth < 80), to be
455
non-missing in at least 3 individuals per population. Genotype likelihoods for the X and Y chromosomes were
456
calculated under the GATK haploid model with depth ﬁlters appropriate for haploid sites (3 < depth < 40).
457
Only reads with MQ > 20 and bases with call quality > 13 were considered, and ampliconic regions (plus a 100
458
kb buffer on each side) were masked. Site-wise allele frequencies were computed within each population sepa-
459
rately, and the joint SFS across non-missing sites in the three populations was estimated from these frequencies.
460
The consensus genotype from a single Mus spicilegus male was used as the ancestral sequence to polarize alleles
461
as ancestral or derived. Ensembl v87 reference annotations were used to deﬁne internecine sites, intronic sites,
462
0-fold and 4-fold degenerate sites.
463
Diversity statistics and neutrality tests were calculated from joint SFS using standard formulae implemented
464
in a custom Python package, sfspy (http://github.com/andrewparkermorgan/sfspy). Uncertainties
465
for autosomal and X-linked sites were obtained by bootstrapping over loci, since the X and autosomes recom-
466
bine; and for Y-linked sites using the built-in bootstrapping method of ANGSD.
467
Models of sex-chromosome diversity under neutral coalescent
468
The expected ratio of X-to-autosome (X:A) and Y-to-autosome (Y:A) pairwise diversity was obtained from the
469
formulae derived in Pool and Nielsen (2007). Deﬁne the inheritance factors hA = 1, hX = 3/4 and hY = 1/4; and
470
mutation rates µA, µA, µY . For an instantaneous change in population size of depth f from starting size N, the
471
expected value of X:A is:

The expression for Y:A can be written similarly. Note that X:A and Y:A depend only on the ratio between

mutation rates on different chromosomes, not the absolute mutation rate. For a bottleneck of depth f, starting

Unequal sex ratios were modeled by calculating the number of X and Y chromosomes per autosome, given
478
ﬁxed autosomal effective population size, using standard formulae as in Sayres et al. (2014), and passing these
479
into the equations above via the parameter hX or hY .
480
In Figure S3, we plot X:A against Y:A. For the bottleneck and step-change models, X:A and Y:A vary with
481
time since the onset of size change; these trajectories can be traced clockwise along each curve from t = 0 to
482
t = 4N (backwards in time.)
483
Demographic inference
484
The four demographic models illustrated in Figure 7A were ﬁt to autosomal SFS using ∂a∂i v1.7 (Gutenkunst
485
et al. 2009). We ﬁt each model separately to each population, using the sum of marginal spectra from 1000
486
approximately unlinked, putatively neutral intergenic regions each 100 kb in size, spanning a total of 85.4
487
Mb of callable sites after removing those missing in one or more populations. Because the depth, duration
488
and onset of a bottleneck have are confounded in the SFS, we ﬁxed the duration of the bottleneck to be short
489
(0.1Ne generations) and attempted to estimate the remaining two parameters. We additionally constrained the
490
bottleneck model to include recovery to exactly the starting population size.
491
Convergence of model ﬁts was assessed qualitatively by re-ﬁtting each model from 10 sets of randomly-
492
drawn initial values. We conﬁrmed that the best-ﬁtting models shown in Figure 7 represent the “modal” result,
493
in that a majority of independent runs reach a solution within 5 log-likelihood units of the one shown. Param-
494
eter estimates should nonetheless be interpreted with caution, as their uncertainties are wide.
495
Models of natural selection
496
To model the effect of natural selection on Y-linked diversity while accounting for possible non-stationary de-
497
mographic processes, we used forward simulations implemented in SLiM v2.2.1 (Haller and Messer 2017). For
498
M. m. domesticus we simulated from a stationary model; for M. m. musculus, from an exponential growth model.
499
We considered two modes of selection: background selection (BGS) due to purifying selection against dele-
500
terious mutations at linked sites; and hard selective sweeps on newly-arising beneﬁcial mutations. Relative
501
ﬁtness in SLiM is modeled as 1 + s for sex-limited chromosomes. BGS was modeled by introducing muta-
502
tions whose selection coefﬁcients s were drawn from a mixture of a gamma distribution with mean −γ = −N¯s
503
(100×α% of mutations), and a point mass at zero ((100×(1−α)% of mutations.) BGS simulations were run for

10N generations, sufﬁcient to reach mutation-selection-drift equilibrium. For selective sweeps, the simulation
505
was ﬁrst run for 10N generations of burn-in, and then a beneﬁcial variant was introduced with s drawn from a
506
gamma distribution with mean γ = N¯s. The simulation was then tracked until the beneﬁcial variant was ﬁxed
507
or lost; in the case of loss, the run was re-started from the end of the burn-in period with a new mutation. We
508
conﬁrmed the integrity of simulations by checking that the pairwise diversity achieved by runs with selection
509
coefﬁcients ﬁxed at zero matched the observed neutral values for each population (not shown.) Values of α
510
were drawn from a uniform distribution on (0, 1], and values of γ were drawn from a log-uniform distribution
511
on (10−6, 103]. Runs were scaled for computational performance.
512
Simulations were connected to an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) inference procedure imple-
513
mented with the R package abc (Csilléry et al. 2012). Brieﬂy, 500, 000 simulations were performed for each
514
model. Five summary statistics were calculated from the SFS generated by each simulation: Watterson’s esti-
515
mator θw; Tajima’s estimators θπ and θζ; Tajima’s D; and Fu and Li’s D. The same set of statistics was computed
516
for the observed joint SFS. The 0.1% of simulations with smallest Euclidean distance to the observed sum-
517
mary statistics were retained, accounting for collinearity between summary statistics using the “neuralnet”
518
method of the function abc::abc(). Posterior distributions were computed via kernel smoothing over the
519
parameter values of the retained simulations using an Epanechnikov kernel and plug-in bandwidth estimate.
520
Models were compared via their Bayes factors, calculated using the abc::postpr() function. To conﬁrm
521
the ﬁdelity of the best-ﬁtting model, summary statistics for pseudo-observed datasets (i.e. simulations from the
522
posterior distributions) were checked against the observed summary statistics.
523
Size estimation of co-ampliﬁed regions of Yq and X
524
Copy number of ampilconic genes on Yq and X was estimated as follows. First, all paralogs in each family were
525
identiﬁed by BLAT and BLAST searches using the sequences of canonical family members from Ensembl. These
526
searches were necessary because many member of each family are annotated only as “predicted genes” (gene
527
symbols “GmXXXX”). Based on BLAST results we assigned the Spin2/4 family – with members in several clus-
528
ters on the proximal X chromosome – as Sstx. Normalized coverage was estimated for each non-overlapping
529
paralog by counting the total number of reads mapped and dividing by the genome-wide average read depth.
530
Identiﬁcation of de novo CNVs in Collaborative Cross lines
531
Whole-genome sequencing reads (2 × 150 bp paired-end) from a single male individual from each 69 distinct
532
Collaborative Cross (CC) lines were obtained from Srivastava et al. (2017). Alignment and quality control was
533
performed as for wild mice. Read depth was estimated in 100 kb bins across the Y chromosome for each indi-
534
vidual, and normalized for the effective depth of sequencing in that sample. Unambiguous alignment of 150 bp

reads to the highly repetitive sequence on Yq is clearly not possible. However, each of the 8 founder Y chromo-
536
some haplogroups in the CC produces a characteristic read depth proﬁle when reads are aligned with bwa-mem.
537
We exploited this fact to remove noise from ambiguous read mapping by re-normalizing the estimated depth
538
in each bin for each sample agains the median depth in that bin for CC lines sharing the same Y chromosome
539
haplogroup (listed in Table S2). Any remaining deviations in read depth represent variation among lines shar-
540
ing the same Y chromosome haplogroup, that is, candidate de novo CNVs. CNVs were ascertained by manual
541
inspection of the re-normalized read depth proﬁle of each CC line.
542
Analyses of gene expression
543
Multi-tissue, multi-species dataset. Neme and Tautz (Neme and Tautz 2016) measured gene expression in whole
544
testis from wild-derived outbred mice from several species (Figure 9A) using RNA-seq. Reads were retrieved
545
from the European Nucleotide Archive (PRJEB11513). Transcript-level expression was estimated using kallisto
546
(Bray et al. 2016) using the Ensembl 85 transcript catalog augmented with all Slx/y, Sstx/y and Srsx/y transcripts
547
identiﬁed in (Soh et al. 2014). In the presence of redundant transcripts (i.e. from multiple copies of a co-
548
ampliﬁed gene family), kallisto uses an expectation-maximization algorithm to distribute the “weight” of
549
each read across transcripts without double-counting. Transcript-level expression estimates were aggregated
550
to the gene level for differential expression testing using the R package tximport. As for the microarray data,
551
“predicted” genes (with symbols “GmXXXX”) on the Y chromosome were assigned to a co-ampliﬁed family
552
where possible using Ensembl Biomart.
553
Gene-level expression estimates were transformed to log scale and gene-wise dispersion parameters esti-
554
mated using the voom() function in the R package limma. Genes with total normalized abundance (length-
555
scaled transcripts per million, TPM) < 10 in aggregate across all samples were excluded, as were genes with
556
TPM > 1 in fewer than three samples.
557
Spermatogenesis time course. Larson et al. (2016a) measured gene expression in isolated spermatids of three
558
males from each of four F1 crosses — CZECHII/EiJ×PWK/PhJ; LEWES/EiJ×PWK/PhJ; PWK/PhJ×LEWES/EiJ;
559
and WSB/EiJ×LEWES/EiJ — using RNA-seq. Reads were retrieved from NCBI Short Read Archive (SRP065082).
560
Transcript-level expression was estimated using kallisto (Bray et al. 2016) using the Ensembl 85 transcript
561
catatlog augmented with all Slx/y, Sstx/y and Srsx/y transcripts identiﬁed in (Soh et al. 2014). In the presence of
562
redundant transcripts (i.e. from multiple copies of a co-ampliﬁed gene family), kallisto uses an expectation-
563
maximization algorithm to distribute the “weight” of each read across transcripts without double-counting.

Deﬁnition of tissue-speciﬁc gene sets. The “tissue speciﬁcity index” (τ) of Yanai et al. (2005) was used to deﬁne
572
tissue- or cell-type-speciﬁc gene sets. The index was ﬁrst proposed for microarray data, and was adapted for
573
RNA-seq as follows. Deﬁne Ti to be the mean log-scaled expression of a gene in tissue or cell type i (of N
574
total), as estimated by limma. We require expression values to be strictly positive, so let q = mini Ti and deﬁne
575
˜Ti = Ti + q. Finally, calculate τ as
576
τ =
1
N −1
N
X
i
1 −˜Ti
˜Tmax
The set of testis-biased genes was deﬁned as all those with τ > 0.5 and higher expression in testis than
577
in any of the other seventeen tissues in the multi-tissue dataset (PRJEB11897, Harr et al. (2016)). The set of
578
ubiquitously-expressed genes was deﬁned as those with τ < 0.25 and whose expression was above the median
579
expression in the highest-expressing tissue. The set of early-meiosis genes was deﬁned as those with τ > 0.5
580
and highest expression in leptotene/zygotene spermatocytes; spermatid genes were deﬁned as those with τ >
581
0.5 and highest expression in round spermatids. We analyzed expression speciﬁcity during spermatogenesis
582
separately in the two intra-subspeciﬁc F1 crosses, and took the union of the resulting gene sets.

Supplement
828
Caveats to demographic models
829
Like all models, the scenarios of neutral demography and natural selection presented here are greatly simpliﬁed
830
and almost certainly wrong. We chose to consider the history of each of the three subspecies independently,
831
rather than in a joint isolation-with-migration or isolation-by-distance model, because the one-population mod-
832
els could be ﬁt more robustly and more easily checked against analytical formulae. The simple models are
833
nonetheless useful as guideposts along the way to a better approximation of the true history of the mouse sex
834
chromosomes. On the basis of autosomal SFS, we can conﬁdently reject scenarios with a single very sharp
835
(f ≪0.1) reduction in population size with or without unequal sex ratio as the sole explanation for lack of
836
Y-linked diversity. Likewise we can rule out exponential growth alone, because it actually increases X:A and
837
Y:A relative to a stationary model (Figure S3C). One important possibility that we have not considered is a
838
ﬂuctuating sex ratio. An “arms race” between the X and Y chromosomes for transmission in the male germline
839
could lead to oscillations between a male-biased and female-biased population. Even if deviations in the sex
840
ratio are transient, the net effect could be to reduce diversity on both sex chromosomes relative to autosomes
841
out of proportion to the strength of selection.
842
Disentangling the effects of demography and selection on the Y chromosome is especially challenging be-
843
cause the Y has the smallest effective population size and is inherited without recombination, so it is most
844
susceptible to changes in population size, to background selection and to selective sweeps. We have used ABC
845
to show that Y-linked SFS are consistent with recent positive selection. Of course the fact that selective sweeps
846
offer plausible ﬁt, conditional on neutral demographic history, does not rule out background selection. Both
847
mammalian Y and avian W chromosomes, which have independent evolutionary origins, retain a convergent
848
set of dosage-sensitive genes with roles in core cellular processes (Bellott et al. 2017). The proportion of sub-
849
stitutions in these genes ﬁxed by positive selection (αSEW, Figure 8) is indeed much smaller than for X-linked
850
genes. Together these results imply relatively strong purifying selection on ancestral Y genes, which in the ab-
851
sence of recombination should constrain diversity on the entire chromosome. This is an important alternative
852
hypothesis to a hitchhiking effect associated with positive selection on Yq.
