Abstract: Chemical properties and biological activity of Au(III)
compounds obtained from dichlorido[2-(dimethylaminometh-
yl)phenyl-C1,N]gold(III), [Au(damp-C1,N)Cl2], and halogenated,
potentially tridentate thiosemicarbazones have been studied.
The results of this work show that the complexation of the halo-
genated thiosemicarbazones with Au(III) enhances their stability
against hydrolysis and retains or enhances their anti-parasitic
activity. Fluorination in the periphery of the ligands has expect-
Introduction
American trypanosomiasis or Chaga's disease, caused by the
parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a major public health problem in
Latin America, where it constitutes one of the leading causes
of mortality from cardiovascular diseases. Besides this, the prob-
lem is expanding to global proportions as a consequence of
migration. Currently available chemotherapy of trypanosomiasis
basing on a nitrofuran (nifurtimox) and a nitroimidazole (benz-
nidazole) is unsatisfactory because of their poor efficacy in the
chronic stage of the disease and severe side effects. Therefore,
new approaches to specific chemotherapy are being devel-
oped.[1–3]
Gold(III) complexes acquire an important role in the research
against parasitic diseases. The affinity of gold-based com-
pounds for thiol- and selenol-containing proteins, which have
been identified as drug targets in trypanosomes, makes them
promising candidates in this field.[4] Recently, some gold(III)

Au(III) complexes, but modulates their biological behaviour.
Best results with a remarkably high selectivity index for the
trypomastigote form of Trypanosoma cruzi were obtained
with the complex containing the ligand, which presents a 3,5-
fluorine substitution in meta-position of an aromatic ring,

composition
[Au(dampH)(tsc)]Cl derived from the organometallic precursor
dichlorido[2-(dimethylaminomethyl)phenyl-C1,N]gold(III),
[Au(damp-C1,N)Cl2] were studied for their trypanocidal activity.
In vitro biological assays showed reasonable cytotoxic and po-
tent trypanocidal effects. The structure-activity relationship of
a series of such compounds indicates that substituents at the
thiosemicarbazone moiety have a significant effect on the bio-
logical activities of the complexes. The non-coordinated thio-
semicarbazones show lower activity than their Au(III) complexes
and the complexation also increases the stability of the mole-
cules.[5] The high potential observed for these compounds, par-
ticularly those with R1 = R2 = CH3, is the motivation for further
investigations and optimization of their properties.
Fluorine-containing compounds play a central role in medici-
nal chemistry. It is known that the selective introduction of

fluorine into an organic molecule can productively influence
conformation, pKa, intrinsic potency, membrane permeability,
metabolic pathways, and pharmacokinetic properties. In the
last fifty years, nearly 150 fluorinated molecules have been ap-
proved for therapeutic use. In 2010, it was calculated that about
20 % of administered drugs contain fluorine atoms or fluoro-
alkyl groups. This trend is increasing from 20 % to about 30 %
for all new approved drugs, excluding biopharmaceutical prod-
ucts.[6] There is, in theory, no reason to expect that the positive
effects induced by fluorine on the medical properties of organic
pharmaceuticals might not be observed for metal complexes as
well. Nevertheless, not many studies have been conducted in
this field.[7,8]
Recently, we demonstrated that the fluorination of thiosemi-
carbazones can enhance their antiparasitic activity.[9] But at the
same time an increased hydrolytic instability was observed,
which complicates the comprehension of their mechanism of
action. Thus, the question arises, whether the complexation of
the fluorinated ligands can stabilize the molecule and improve
the anti-Trypanosoma cruzi activity. Consequently, we synthe-
tized halogenated analogues of the anti-trypanosomal com-
pound obtained by Maia et al. (R1 = R2 = CH3),[5] and studied
how the halogen-substitution influences the hydrolytic and
redox stability, the solubility and the anti-parasitic activity of
the novel Au(III)-thiosemicarbazone complexes.

The IR spectra of the compounds show broad bands around
3350 cm–1, which can be assigned to the NH groups. This is in
accordance with the protonation of the uncoordinated amino
group of the dampH ligand. Sharp, very intense absorptions in
the range between 1490 and 1495 cm–1 belong to the C=N
stretches of the ligand.

The 1H NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3. The NH signals
of the thiosemicarbazones around 9.4 ppm disappear upon co-
ordination confirming the double deprotonation of the ligands.
New signals appear at low-field in the region between 12.2 and
12.3 ppm, corresponding to the protonated amino group of the
dampH ligand. The aromatic range of the spectrum shows the
resonances of the two substituted phenyl rings of the ligands
between 8.12 and 6.80 ppm. The set of signals of the dampH
ring is only weakly affected by the fluorine substitution and is
similar in all compounds. The resonances of the thiosemicarbaz-
one rings, however, are shifted and change in multiplicity, num-
ber and integral with respect to the fluorine substitution. For
the para-substituted ligands, they can easily be identified by
their integrals. For the meta-substituted ligands, the pattern be-
comes more complex and the signals can be assigned based on
their multiplicity and by a comparative analysis of the spectra.
Two doublets of doublets are found at 4.4 and 4.5 ppm. They
belong to the two non-equivalent geminal protons of the
methylene groups of damp, which additionally couple to the
NH protons with a coupling constant of ca. 13 Hz. The most
plausible reason for the inequivalence of the CH2 protons is
given by steric constraints due to the relatively short Au–C
bonds and the bulky dimethylammonium substituent (see also
the space-filling model in Figure 1, which has been drawn using
the van der Waals radii of the atoms).[10,11] The formation of
agostic CH···Au interactions (Au···H distances between 2.742
and 2.771 Å) might not completely be ruled out, but are im-
probable in the light of a recent re-consideration of a large
number of Au(I) and Au(II) complexes with relatively short
Au···H distances.[12]

consequence of a hindered rotation around the C-NEt2 bonds,
as is frequently observed for ligands and complexes of this
type.[8,9] The methyl resonance appears as well-resolved triplet,
while the methylene signals are broadened, probably due to
the fact that the coalescence temperature of the system is near
to room temperature.
The unambiguous assignment of the 13C signals is possible
by means of the 19F-13C couplings and comparison with the
signals of related oxidorhenium(V) complexes, in which key
positions of the ligands were 13C-enriched. The signals of the
imine carbon atoms are shifted up-field upon complex forma-
tion, while the C=S resonances are down-field shifted from the
range between 178 and 182 ppm by about 20 ppm. Thus, the
C=N signals are found right beside the more shielded C=S ones.
This is clearly confirmed by the 13C spectrum of compound 3,5-
diF, for which the signal at 154.1 ppm is a triplet, doubtlessly
indicating the proximity of the related carbon atom to the two
fluorine atoms in the meta positions of the phenyl ring.
All the 19F NMR spectra present one signal, indicating the
purity of the compounds. The signal of the mono-fluorinated
complexes are slightly up-field shifted (ca. 2 ppm) in compari-
son to the uncoordinated ligands. The trifluoromethyl groups
are not sensible to the complex formation.
All ESI+ mass spectra show exclusively the molecular ions of
the cationic complexes with high intensities. An additional
peak, which is also observed in all spectra appears at m/z =
74.097 and can most probably be assigned to the elimination
of H2NEt2+ cations (calculated mass: 74.0969). There was no evi-
dence for the formation of Au(I) species or hydrolysis products
of the fluorinated ligands. Obviously, the fluorination does not
affect the stability of the gold(III) damp complexes, which is
unlike the behavior of related complexes of the composition
[Au(L-X)Cl], where considerable cyclization of the thiosemicarb-
azones and the formation of Au(I) complexes was observed and
unambiguously detected in the mass spectra of the com-
plexes.[13]
The low solubility of the compounds in water prevents the
use of 19F NMR spectroscopy for the estimation of their stability
in the aqueous medium used in the biological tests.
Single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction could be grown
for three gold complexes with fluorinated ligands (4-F, 4-CF3
and 3-CF3). An ellipsoid representation of the structure of the
complex cation of compound 4-CF3 is depicted in Figure 1a.
The structures of the other complexes are virtually identical
(with the exception of the respective positions of fluorine at-
oms) and, thus, not shown here in extra Figures (but details
are contained in the Supporting Information). Selected bond
lengths and angles for the three compounds are given in
Table 1. For comparison, the values for the non-fluorinated
complex [Au(dampH)(L-H)]NO3 (4-H) have been included.
The bond lengths and angles of Table 1 clearly show that
the fluorination of the ligands has only minor influence on the
molecular structures of the formed gold complexes. No signifi-
cant differences in the bond lengths and angles are observed
between the fluorinated complexes and the previously reported
non-fluorinated compound [Au(dampH)(L-H)]NO3.[5] The dou-
ble-deprotonated thiosemicarbazones coordinate the gold

atoms as S,N,S-chelates. The fourth coordination position of the
distorted square coordination sphere is occupied by the orga-
nometallic ligand. As in the non-fluorinated complexes,[5] the
damp ligand coordinates monodentate and the nitrogen atom
of the dimethylamino group is protonated. It forms a hydrogen
bond to the Cl– counterion.
Although the fluorination of the thiosemicarbazones has al-
most no influence on the molecular structures of the formed
complexes and their stability, the packing patterns of the solid-
state structures are strongly influenced by the introduction of
the fluorine atoms or CF3 groups. Figure 2 illustrates the crystal
packing of 4-F. Similarly to the situation in [Au(dampH)(L-
H)]Cl,[5] the cations of 4-F are arranged in double-layers with
alternate polarity, which allows the co-crystallization of water
and benzene in the same crystal. Two molecules are stacked to
each other and face themselves across their non-polar sides
forming hydrophobic pockets. They are filled with a benzene
molecule. Between the two pairs of molecules is a hydrophilic
space, to which the dimethylammonium groups point. This void
is filled with the chloride ions and water molecules. There are
hydrogen bonds between the dimethylammonium groups and
the counterions and between Cl– and the water molecules.

cules.
The solid-state structure of the more lipophilic molecule 4-
CF3 has a more compact packing, which is dominated by lipo-

philic interactions. The molecules form parallel layers and the
hydrophilic units point outward and interact with the counter-
ions. As a result, orthogonal lipophilic and hydrophilic layers
alternate each other. The trifluoromethyl group in the meta-
position has a similar effect. It is noteworthy that the crystal
packing of 3-CF3 affords the proximity of the CF3 groups, which
probably enhances the stabilization of hydrophobic interactions
(for a Figure see Supporting Information).
Recently, we reported the remarkable activity of seven halo-
gen-substituted thiosemicarbazones against the flagellated pro-
tozoa T. cruzi.[9] The results encouraged us to continue the in
vitro experiments with the gold(III) complexes of the present
study, which contain the halogenated ligands of the previous
work. The influence of the metal centers and halogen substitu-
ents were exploited on epimastigote, trypomastigote and
amastigote forms of T. cruzi. The results are summarized in
Table 2.

transformations in vertebrate (mammals) and invertebrate hosts
(Reduviidae insect family).[14] Epimastigote forms live in the in-
vertebrate host and are unable to establish mammalian infec-
tion.[15] Although non-infective to mammalian, the biological
activity in these forms can provide knowledge about the struc-
ture-activity relationship, especially when a class of compounds
may act in essential molecular targets for three evolutive forms
of parasites, as discussed below.[16]
The percentages of growth inhibition in epimastigotes are
given in terms of IC50 values and compared to the reference
drug benznidazole (BZ). Almost all Au(III) complexes of this
study show a high activity at low micromolar concentrations
and they are statistically as active as BZ. An exception is com-
plex 4-Cl, which contains a chlorine substituent. Interestingly,
the presence of chlorine seems to diminish drastically the
biological activity of the thiosemicarbazone complex, what is
evidenced by the lack of epimastigotes inhibition even at the
maximum concentration tested (IC50>100 μM).
Although Au(III) and Pt(II) ions are isoelectronic and their
complexes are frequently isostructural, it is not very probable
that the mechanism of the biological activity of the complexes
under study is DNA-related as is known for the anti-cancer ac-
tivity of compounds of the cis-platin family.[17] Gold(III) com-
pounds frequently trigger other biochemical mechanisms by
modification or selective inhibition of thiol- or selenol-contain-

ing proteins.[4,17,18] Recent studies have shown that thiosemi-
carbazones may inhibit cruzain, the major thiol-containing en-
zyme from T. cruzi, by attaching irreversibly to the catalytic
Cys25 thiol group of this compound.[19,20] Expressed in all sta-
ges of the T. cruzi life cycle, cruzain is essential to many biologi-
cal processes including metacyclogenesis (invertebrate stage)
and host invasion and evasion of the host immune response
(vertebrate stage) by the parasite.[17]
The presence of a large number of trypomastigote forms in
the bloodstream marks the acute phase of Chagas disease in
mammalian hosts and all types of nucleated cells in the hosts
are potential targets for infection.[21] A serial dilution of the
Au(III) complexes was performed to determine the concentra-
tions, which kill 50 % of trypomastigotes (IC50 tryp). All halogen-
ated compounds show a high activity at very low concentra-
tions. The IC50 tryp values of the complexes with the fluorinated
ligands are approximately five times lower than that of benznid-
azole. Only the activity of 4-H, 4-Br and 3-F and 4-Cl is some-
what lower, but still in the range of BZ or better. It is remarkable
that trypomastigotes appear to be much more susceptible to
4-Cl than the epimastigote forms of the parasite.
Lopes and co-workers showed the effective activity of the
non-halogenated [Au(dampH)(L-H)]Cl.[22] It eliminates both the
extracellular trypomastigote and the intracellular amastigote
forms of the parasite. In very-low-dose in vivo assays, the gold
complex also reduced blood parasitaemia and tissue parasitism
in the acute phase of Chagas disease. It is well-known that
trypomastigotes play an important role during the progression
to the chronic phase of Chagas disease.[23] In immunocompe-
tent patients, the acute phase is controlled by the effector ac-
tion of the immune response, but it cannot completely elimi-
nate the blood parasites that migrate easily to target tissues
where they invade cells and transform into proliferative amasti-
gote forms.[24] In this sense, the efficacy of the metal com-
pounds was also investigated on the intracellular stage of
T. cruzi after infection of LLC-MK2 cells.
An increase in LLC-MK2 cells survival and amastigotes prolif-
eration inhibition presents a measure of the effectiveness of
potential drugs. In contrast, the death of the host cells during
the analyses is indicative of cytotoxicity. In this sense, the ratio
between the cytotoxic activity (CC50) and trypanocidal activity
(IC50) is also provided in Table 2, in order to determine the

selectivity index for the individual gold complexes (SI = CC50/
IC50).[25]
The gold complexes do not inhibit the proliferation of amas-
tigotes in concentration equal or smaller than that of BZ. Except
for 4-Br, the coordination of the thiosemicarbazones to gold
appears to increase the toxicity of the compounds when com-
pared to the non-coordinated compounds. This effect is inde-
pendent of the halogen-substitution. Interestingly, the Cl- and
Br-substituted complexes show a lower trypanocidal activity
than the respective non-coordinated thiosemicarbazones.
The differences in trypanocidal activity and cytotoxicity be-
tween the non-coordinated thiosemicarbazones and their gold
chelates is not unexpected with regard to the changes in polar-
ity, charge and solubility of the respective compounds. The in-
creased lipophilicity after complexation enhances their cellular
uptake, but also decreases their solubility in aqueous media,
which is a serious drawback in terms of bioavailability,[26] and
can in worst case distort the obtained in vitro results. We came
across such an effect when we re-evaluated some of the previ-
ously determined in vitro parameters of the non-halogenated
complex 4-H.[22] Actually, we found that the previously deter-
mined CC50 value for this compound was too high, most proba-
bly due to an insufficient solubility at higher concentrations.
Thus, the values of Table 2 shall be used for comparison with
the data of the halogenated complexes.
In fact, the improved anti-T. cruzi activity, which has been
found for the halogenated thiosemicarbazones when compared
to their non-halogenated representative,[9] can also be con-
firmed for their gold(III) chelates. Here, it was demonstrated that
Au complexes may also act effectively in the control of trypo-
mastigotes in low concentrations. Expanding the relation be-
tween cytotoxicity and anti-trypomastigote activity, the selecti-
vity index was provided. Except 4-Cl and 3-F, all the complexes
possess SI's higher than 10, which recommends them to anti-T.

on epimastigote (IC50 8.9 ± 1.2 μM), trypomastigote (IC50=
3.2 ± 0.4 μM, SI = 18.8) and amastigote (19.3 ± 2.5 μM, SI = 3.1)
forms of T. cruzi.
Conclusions
A series of organometallic Au(III) complexes with halogenated
thiosemicarbazone ligands were prepared and completely char-
acterized. Three of them were also studied by single-crystal X-
ray diffraction, showing that the fluorination has only minor
influence on the molecular structures of the complexes, but
strongly influence their solid-state structures. Unlike the unco-
ordinated thiosemicarbazones,[9] the gold complexes are stable
at room temperature as solids and in solution, Thus, the coordi-
nation with the {Au(dampH)} moiety is a convenient tool, for
stabilizing the halogenated ligands, maintaining and, in some
cases, even enhancing their biological activity.
The possibility to modulate lipophilicity, pharmacokinetic
properties and bioavailability of potential drugs by halogen-
substitution has previously been demonstrated for a series of
halogenated thiosemicarbazones.[9,27] The main problem with
these compounds, their low stability as solids, could be solved

by the preparation of stable gold(III) chelates. The halogen-sub-
stituted Au(III) complexes are highly active in trypomastigote
forms of T. cruzi. The results of the present study encourage to
perform ongoing studies, mainly dealing with in vivo low dose
protocols, which may provide deeper knowledge about biodis-
tribution, biotransformation and pharmacokinetic parameters
and give us more clinically-relevant information on the design
of new anti-trypanosomiasis drugs on the basis of such com-
plexes for clinical studies.
Another interesting result of the present study is the higher
cytotoxicity of the gold complexes to LLC-MK2 cells compared
to the uncoordinated ligands, and the lower activity against
amastigote forms (intracellular form) than against trypomasti-
gote forms (extracellular). From this, it may be concluded that
these compounds shall also be cytotoxic against cancer cells.
The effectiveness of gold compounds in biological systems de-
pends on a series of complex interactions between metals, cel-
lular components and genes. However, not different from other
compound classes, they can also induce deleterious effects on
healthy cells. Considering the different mechanisms of action
that gold compounds may have (vide supra), future studies
should be encouraged to investigate the antiparasitic mecha-
nism of action of these complexes as well as to investigate
them for anti-cancer activity.

Materials and methods. [Au(damp)Cl2] and the thiosemicarbazone
ligands were prepared according to literature methods.[9,28] All
other chemicals were purchased and used without further purifica-
tion. NMR spectra were recorded with a JEOL 400 MHz multinuclear
spectrometer. Positive and negative ESI mass spectra were meas-
ured with an Agilent 6210 ESI-TOF (Agilent Technology) mass spec-
trometer. Elemental analysis of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and
sulfur were performed using a Heraeus elemental analyzer. Infrared
spectra were recorded at an ATR-spectrometer (Nicolet iS10,
Thermo Scientific).
X-ray crystallography. The intensities for the X-ray diffraction stud-
ies were collected on a Bruker D8 Venture or a STOE IPDS 2T instru-
ment with Mo Kα radiation. Absorption corrections were carried
out by SADABS or X-RED 32.[29,30] Structure solution and refinement
were performed with the SHELX program package.[31,32] Hydrogen
atoms were placed at calculated positions and treated with the
“riding model” option of SHELXL. The representation of molecular
structures was done using the program DIAMOND (vers. 4.5.1).[33]
CCDC 1947212 (for 4-CF3), 197213 (for 4-F), and 1947214 (for 3-
CF3) contain the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper.

Synthesis
General procedure for the synthesis of the [Au(dampH)(L-X)]Cl
complexes. [Au(damp)Cl2] (40 mg, 0.1 mmol) was dissolved in 2 mL
of acetonitrile and H2L (0.1 mmol) was added. The resulting orange-
red solution was stirred overnight at room temperature. The addi-
tion of diethyl ether (5 mL) gave an orange-red solid, which was
filtered off and dried in vacuo.

Biological Tests
Parasites, mammalian cells and compounds. The experiments
were performed using the Tulahuen strain of T. cruzi transfected
with the Escherichia coli -galactosidase gene lacZ.[34] Epimastigote
forms were cultivated at 28 °C in liver infusion tryptose (LIT) me-
dium,[35] continuously maintained in logarithmic growth by weekly
passages. Trypomastigote forms were maintained by weekly
inoculations in monkey kidney cells LLC-MK2 (ATCC® CCL-7™) culti-
vated in RPMI-1640 medium (Roswell Park Memorial Institute –
Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C in humidified air and 5 % CO2. Both media
were supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 U/mL
penicillin, 0.05 mg/mL streptomycin. The compounds were dis-
solved in dimethyl sulfoxide and used at a concentration of less
than 1 % during experiments. Benznidazole (BZ) (Sigma-Aldrich)
was used as positive control.
Epimastigotes growth inhibition assay. The activity of the gold
complexes against epimastigotes was assessed by the fluorescence
resazurin assay as described previously.[36] In a 96-well microplate,
epimastigotes in log-phase were seeded at 1 × 106 epimastigotes/
well with different concentrations (100–0.78 μM) of the Au com-
plexes and BZ in duplicate. After 72 h at 28 °C, parasites viability
was assessed by adding 10 μL/well of resazurin solution (0.1 %),
followed by incubation for 5 h at 37 °C. Fluorescence intensity was
measured using a microplate reader (Synergy H1 Biotek) at λexcitation
of 530 nm and at λemission of 600 nm. The inhibitory concentration
that reduces 50 % of parasites viability (IC50) was calculated by a
dose-response curve regarding the untreated control.
Trypomastigotes inhibition assay. Trypomastigotes were har-
vested from the supernatant of LLC-MK2 cells six days post infection
in vitro. Parasites were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min to re-
move dead cells. Remaining supernatant was centrifuged at
3000 rpm for 10 min and concentration was adjusted at 5 × 105
parasites/well in fresh RPMI medium. Trypomastigotes were incu-
bated in 96-well plates with different concentrations (100–0.78 μM)
of the Au complexes and BZ in duplicate. After incubation for 24 h

at 37 °C, the 50 % effective concentrations (EC50) of the compounds
were obtained regarding untreated control afterward counting mo-
bile parasites in an optic microscope.[37]
Intracellular amastigotes inhibition assay. LLC-MK2 cells were
cultivated in 96-well plates (5 × 103 cells/well) with Tulahuen trypo-
mastigotes (5 × 104 cells/well) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of
10. After 48 h, infected cells were washed twice with phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS) to remove non-internalized parasites and
200 μL of fresh medium was added in duplicate with serial dilution
(100 - 1.56 μM) of the Au complexes and BZ. After 72 h, viability of
amastigotes was assessed from 50 μL of PBS containing 2 % of Tri-
ton X-100 and 200 μM CPRG. -Galactosidase enzyme catalyzes the
hydrolysis of the yellow reagent of CPRG into a red chromophore
that is easily detected by an absorbance at 570 nm after 4 h at
37 °C of incubation (microplate reader - Synergy™H1).[27] Percent-
age inhibition of 50 % (IC50) on amastigote forms was calculated
by a dose-response curve regarding the untreated control.
Cytotoxicity on mammalian cells. The cytotoxicity effects of the
Au complexes on LLC-MK2 was asserted by the Thiazolyl Blue Tet-
razolium Bromide salt (MTT) as described previously.[38] Mammalian
cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a concentration of 5 × 103
cells/well during 48 h at 37 °C and 5 % CO2. Thereafter, the plates
were washed twice with PBS and 200 μL of fresh medium was
added in duplicate with serial dilution of the Au complexes and BZ
as described above (starting from 100 μM). After 72 h of incubation,
the supernatant was carefully removed and 50 μL of MTT solution
(2.0 mg/mL) was added on each well. The plates were further incu-
bated for 4 h at 37 °C and the formazan crystals formed were dis-
solved with DMSO (50 μL/well) after 30 min of incubation at 37 °C.
The absorbance data were obtained from a Synergy H1 microplate
reader and the cytotoxic concentration of 50 % (CC50) on mamma-
lian cells was calculated by a dose-response curve with regard to
the untreated control.
Statistical analysis. In vitro data were expressed as mean and stan-
dard deviation (S.D.) of three independent experiments performed
on three different days. Statistical analysis was performed using
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett′s multi-
ple comparison tests. All analyses were made by GraphPad Prism,
V5.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) and
p-Values < 0.05 were considered as statistically significant.
