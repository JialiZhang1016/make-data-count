Abstract
Background: D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), which encodes the first enzyme in serine
biosynthesis, is overexpressed in human cancers and has been proposed as a drug target. However, whether
PHGDH is critical for the proliferation or homeostasis of tissues following the postnatal period is unknown.
Methods: To study PHGDH inhibition in adult animals, we developed a knock-in mouse model harboring a PHGDH
shRNA under the control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter. With this model, PHGDH depletion can be globally
induced in adult animals, while sparing the brain due to poor doxycycline delivery.
Results: We found that PHGDH depletion is well tolerated, and no overt phenotypes were observed in multiple
highly proliferative cell compartments. Further, despite detectable knockdown and impaired serine synthesis, liver
and pancreatic functions were normal. Interestingly, diminished PHGDH expression reduced liver serine and
ceramide levels without increasing the levels of deoxysphingolipids. Further, liver triacylglycerol profiles were
altered, with an accumulation of longer chain, polyunsaturated tails upon PHGDH knockdown.
Conclusions: These results suggest that dietary serine is adequate to support the function of healthy, adult murine
tissues, but PHGDH-derived serine supports liver ceramide synthesis and sustains general lipid homeostasis.

Background
The amino acid L-serine is derived from the diet, protein
degradation, hydroxymethylation of L-glycine, and/or de
novo biosynthesis. In the first step of de novo L-serine bio-
synthesis, D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH)
catalyzes the formation of 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate
from
the
glycolytic
intermediate
3-phosphoglycerate.
PHGDH activity is increased in many cancer cells as a
consequence of genomic amplification, transcriptional up-
regulation, posttranslational modification, and allosteric
regulation [7, 9, 15, 22, 24, 32, 34, 40]. Cancer cells with
increased PHGDH
activity are
more dependent
on
PHGDH for proliferation, suggesting PHGDH is an at-
tractive
target
for
cancer
therapy.
Indeed,
multiple
PHGDH inhibitors have been developed, although none
have reached the clinic to date.
While the contribution of PHGDH and serine to can-
cer cell metabolism has been well studied [8, 20, 25–27,
33, 39, 46, 47], less is known about the importance of
PHGDH in normal tissues. Whole animal PHGDH dele-
tion is embryonic lethal in mice as a consequence of
overall developmental retardation and brain defects [48].
Brain-specific deletion dramatically reduces L-serine and
D-serine levels in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus
[45], leads to the development of postnatal microcephaly
[45], and results in the accumulation of toxic deoxy-
sphingolipids in the hippocampus [11]. Targeted dele-
tion of PHGDH in endothelial cells is similarly lethal

shortly after birth as a consequence of vascular defects
due to compromised heme synthesis and mitochondrial
function [42]. By contrast, PHGDH deletion in adipo-
cytes presents with no overt phenotype, but improves
glucose tolerance upon diet-induced obesity [31]. How-
ever, whether PHGDH is critical for the proliferation or
homeostasis of other tissues following the postnatal
period is unknown.
To study how PHGDH inhibition affects the functions
of normal tissues in adult animals, we developed a
knock-in mouse model harboring a PHGDH shRNA
under the control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter.
With this model, PHGDH depletion can be globally in-
duced in adult animals, while sparing the brain due to
poor doxycycline penetration. We find that PHGDH de-
pletion is well tolerated in multiple highly proliferative
cell compartments, with no overt phenotypes observed
following knockdown.
Further,
PHGDH
knockdown
leads to a reduction in ceramide levels and an increase
in triglyceride long chain (LC) polyunsaturated fatty acid
(PUFA) content. These results suggest that dietary serine
is adequate to support the function of healthy, adult
murine tissues.
Methods

HPLC grade chloroform (Sigma-Aldrich, 650498-1 L)
and methanol (Sigma-Aldrich, 34860-1 L-R) were ob-
tained from Sigma-Aldrich. HPLC grade water (W5-1)
was from Fisher Scientific. The following internal stan-
dards were used in targeted lipidomics analyses: Cer/Sph
mixture II (contains Cer(d18:1/12:0), cat #LM6005,
Avanti Polar Lipids),
D7-sphinganine (860658, Avanti

1 mg, Avanti Polar Lipids), and C12-dihydro-doxCer
[Cer(m18:0/12:0)] (860481P-1 mg, Avanti Polar Lipids).
The following internal standards were used in metabolo-
mics
analyses:
D3-serine
(DLM-582-0.1,
Cambridge
Isotope Laboratories) and the Metabolomics Amino
Acid

shRNA validation
NIH3T3s (ATCC) and Lenti-X 293 T cells (Clontech)
were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS.
shRNAs were cloned into the LT3GEPIR vector [12] for
shRNA testing. Lentivirus was produced in 293 T cells
using
helper
plasmids
pCMV-dR8.2
dvpr
(addgene
#8455) and pCMV-VSV-G (addgene #8454). NIH3T3
cells were infected with lentivirus encoding doxycycline-
inducible shRNA constructs at an MOI of 0.2 for single-
copy
integration.
Cells
were
treated
with
1 μg/mL
doxycycline for 6 days, and PHGDH expression was
determined by western blot. shRNA #3 (targeting 5′-
ACCTGAACTAATACCTAGTAA-3′) was selected and
cloned into the col1A1 targeting vector cTGME for ESC
targeting.
Mice
To generate shPHGDH mice, C10 murine ES cells [3]
were targeted by recombination-mediated cassette ex-
change as previously described [35] and selected with
hygromycin. Positive clones were screened by PCR and
injected into blastocysts. Mice expressing a Renilla lucif-
erase control shRNA (shREN) [35], and ROSA26-CAGs-
rtTA3 mice [10] were obtained from Dr. Lukas Dow
(Weill Cornell Medicine). Mice were housed and bred in
accordance with the ethical regulations and approval of
the IACUC (protocol #IS00003893R). Mice were main-
tained on a mixed C57B6/129 background. shPHGDH,
R26-CAGs-rtTA3, and shREN, R26-CAGs-rtTA3 mice
were given a doxycycline-containing diet (200 ppm,
Envigo), which was replaced weekly.
Blood counts
Blood was collected from submandibular vein into
Eppendorf tubes containing EDTA. Samples were com-
pletely mixed and stored at room temperature until ana-
lysis. All blood samples were analyzed within 4 h of
collection. Complete blood counts were analyzed with
the Procyte Dx Hematology Analyzer (IDEXX).
Oral glucose tolerance test
Mice were placed on doxycycline diet for approximately
100 days
before
use.
Mice
were
fasted
overnight,
followed by oral administration of 2 g/kg D-glucose solu-
tion. Blood was serially sampled at the indicated time
points, and glucose levels were determined with the
OneTouch
Ultra
Mini
Blood
Glucose
Monitoring
System.
Immunohistochemistry
Tissues were fixed in 10% formalin overnight before em-
bedding in paraffin and sectioning by IDEXX BioAnaly-
tics. Sections were de-paraffinized in xylene, followed by
rehydration in a graded alcohol series. Heat-mediated
antigen retrieval (microwave, 12.5 min on high) was per-
formed in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0). Endogenous
peroxidase activity was quenched with 3% hydrogen per-
oxide in tap water for 5 min. Immunohistochemical
staining was performed with the ImmPRESS HRP anti-
rabbit kit according to manufacturer’s instructions (Vec-
tor Labs), followed by incubation with DAB substrate
(Vector Labs). The following antibodies were used: Ki-67
(1:400; Cell Signaling, 12202).

LC-MS based Lipidomics
The liver or brain tissue samples were homogenized
with a pre-chilled BioPulverizer (59012MS, BioSpec) and
then placed on dry ice. The chloroform:methanol extrac-
tion solvent (v:v = 1:2) containing 5 nM Cer (m18:1/12:
0), 5 nM Cer (m18:0/12:0), 12.5 nM D3-deoxysphinga-
nine, and 50 nM Cer (d18:0/12:0) internal standards was
added to homogenates to meet 50 mg/mL. The samples
were then sonicated in ice cold water using BioruptorTM
UCD-200 sonicator for 5 min (30 s sonication and 30 s
rest cycle; high voltage mode). For serum samples, 75 μL
of chloroform:methanol extraction solvent (v:v = 1:2)
containing 5 nM Cer (m18:1/12:0), 50 nM of Cer (d18:0/
12:0), and 12.5 nM D3-deoxysphinganine internal stan-
dards was added to 20 μL of mouse serum. After shaking
(1400 rpm, 20 °C, 5 min), the extracts were cleared by
centrifugation (17,000 g, 20 °C, 10 min), and the lipids in
the supernatant were analyzed by LC-MS.
The HPLC condition was adapted from a previous
study [17]. Chromatographic separation was conducted
on a Brownlee SPP C18 column (2.1 mm × 75 mm,
2.7 μm particle size, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) using
mobile phase A (100% H2O containing 0.1% formic acid
and 1% of 1 M NH4OAc) and B (1:1 acetonitrile:isopro-
panol containing 0.1% formic acid and 1% of 1 M
NH4OAc). The gradient was programmed as follows: 0–
2 min 35% B, 2–8 min from 35 to 80% B, 8–22 min from
80 to 99% B, 22–36 min 99% B, and 36.1–40 min from
99 to 35% B. The flow rate was 0.400 mL/min. The par-
allel reaction monitoring (PRM) approach was applied
for quantification of deoxysphingolipids in positive ESI
mode. The MS and MS/MS m/z values of deoxysphingo-
lipids for PRM analysis were adapted from a previous
study [11] (Supplementary Table 1). The collision ener-
gies of deoxysphingolipid species for PRM approach
were set as following: 40 for doxCer and dihydro-doxCer
and 15 for deoxysphinganine. For non-targeted lipido-
mics, the data-dependent MS2 scan conditions were ap-
plied: the scan range was from m/z 70–1000, resolution
was 120,000 for MS, and 30,000 for DDMS2 (top 10),
and AGC target was 3E6 for full MS and 1E5 for
DDMS2, allowing ions to accumulate for up to 200 ms
for MS and 50 ms for MS/MS. For MS/MS, the follow-
ing settings are used: isolation window width 1.2 m/z
with an offset of 0.5 m/z, stepped NCE at 10, 15, and 25
a.u., minimum AGC 5E2, and dynamic exclusion of pre-
viously sampled peaks for 8 s.
For targeted lipidomics, deoxysphingolipid and cer-
amide peaks identified by MS2 were manually integrated
using the Thermo Xcaliber Qual Browser. The quantifi-
cation was based on previous methods [11, 36]. For non-
targeted lipidomics, lipid peaks including triacylglycerols
and ceramides were identified, aligned, and exported
using MS-DIAL [41]. The data were further normalized
to the median value of total lipid signals. Only lipids
fully identified by MS2 spectra were included in the
analysis.
Serum serine quantification by GC-MS
50 μL of serum was extracted at −80 °C for 15 min with
450 μL of 88.8% MeOH containing 205 μM D3-serine.
Following centrifugation (17,000 g, 4 °C, 20 min), 100 μL
of supernatant was transferred to a new Eppendorf tube
and then dried by centrifugation under vacuum (Speed-
Vac, Thermo Scientific). The dried pellets were further
derivatized as previously described [6]. Briefly, the pellets
were derivatized by 50 μL of methoxylamine hydrochlor-
ide (40 mg/mL in pyridine) at 30 °C for 90 min. The
derivatized solution was then mixed with 70 μL of ethyl-
acetate in a glass vial, and the mixture was further
derivatized with 80 μL of MSTFA + 1%TMCS solution
at 37 °C for 30 min. The final derivatized solution was
then analyzed by GC-MS as previously described [18]
using an MS scan range from 50 to 600 m/z. The deriva-
tized serine (3TMS, 306 m/z) and D3-serine (3TMS, 309
m/z) peaks were extracted and integrated manually
using the Agilent MassHunter Qualitative Analysis Soft-
ware (Version B.07.00). The quantification was based on
previous methods [4].
Liver and brain serine quantification by LC-MS
After pulverization of liver and brain tissue with a pre-
chilled BioPulverizer (59012MS, BioSpec), the extraction
solvent (80% MeOH containing 2.49 μM 13C3, 15N-serine,
−80 °C) was added for a final concentration of 50 mg
tissue/mL and incubated for 24 hr at −80 °C. The me-
tabolite extracts were centrifuged (17,000 g, 4 °C, 20
min), and the supernatant was analyzed by LC-MS as
previously described [18]. Data was acquired in ESI-
positive mode. For targeted quantification of serine, 12C-
serine and 13C3, 15N-serine peak areas were manually
integrated by EL-Maven (Version 0.6.1). Quantification
was based on previous methods [4].
In vivo glucose tracing
In vivo U-13C-glucose infusions were performed on
shPHGDH and shREN mice implanted with a catheter
in the jugular vein. Catheterized mice were fasted over-
night by transferring to new cages without food and
infused the following morning starting around 8 AM. In-
fusions were performed on awake mice on a tether/
swivel system (Instech Laboratories) to allow free move-
ment during the procedure and prevent anesthesia-
induced changes in metabolism. A solution of 6 mg/g
body weight/mL U-13C-glucose was prepared in sterile
saline. Mice were infused at a rate of 100ul/min for the
first minute and then 3ul/min for the next 2.5 h. At the
end
of
the
infusion,
blood

collected

submandibular vein into serum separator tubes (BD,
cat# 365967) and placed on ice until centrifugation for
serum collection. Next, mice were euthanized by the
cervical dislocation, liver, pancreas, and brain quickly
dissected, and tissues were snap frozen in liquid nitro-
gen. Serum and tissue samples were kept at −80 °C until
analysis.
Tissues were pulverized with a pre-chilled BioPulveri-
zer (59012MS, BioSpec), and the extraction solvent (80%
MeOH, −80 °C) was added for a final concentration of
50 mg tissue/mL, followed by incubation for 24 hr at −
80 °C. For serum metabolite extraction, 90 μL of extrac-
tion solvent (88.8% MeOH, −80 °C) was added to 10 μL
of serum, vortexed for 10 sec, and incubated for 15 min
at −80 °C. The metabolite extracts were centrifuged (17,
000 g, 4 °C, 20 min), and the supernatants were analyzed
by LC-MS as previously described [18]. Data was ac-
quired in ESI-negative mode. For liver tissue, which had
a small amount of M + 3 serine, targeted analysis of 13C-
labeled serine was performed. The ions for selective ion
monitoring (SIM) approach were selected at positive
mode as following: 106 [M + 0 + H]+, 107 [M + 1 + H]+,
108 [M + 2 + H]+, and 109 [M + 3 + H]+
. The labeled or
unlabeled peak areas were integrated using EL-Maven
(Version 0.6.1) or Thermo Xcaliber Qual Browser. Data
were corrected for natural occurring isotope abundance
using the IsoCor Software [28].
Immunoblotting
Tissue lysates were prepared by dounce homogenization
in RIPA buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 150 mM
NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium
deoxycholate)
containing
protease
inhibitors
(Roche
complete). Protein concentrations were determined by
the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Lysates were mixed with
6× sample buffer containing β-ME and separated by
SDS-PAGE using NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitro-
gen), followed by transfer to 0.45 μm nitrocellulose
membranes (GE Healthcare). The membranes were
blocked in 5% non-fat milk in TBST, followed by im-
munoblotting with the following antibodies: PHGDH
(Sigma-Aldrich, HPA021241-100), PHGDH (Cell Signal-
ing, 13428)–liver only, GFP (Cell Signaling, 2956),
HSP90 (Cell Signaling, 4874), and β-actin (Thermo
Fisher, AM4302, clone AC-15).
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using a two-sided unpaired Student’s
t test or Kaplan-Meier analysis as noted. GraphPad
Prism 7 and 8 software were used for all statistical ana-
lyses, and values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically
significant (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001).
Results
Generation of an inducible model for systemic PHGDH
knockdown
In order to evaluate the requirement for serine biosyn-
thesis in normal, proliferating adult tissues, we generated
a mouse model in which an shRNA targeting PHGDH is
linked to GFP and expressed in a doxycycline-inducible
manner (Fig. 1a). To generate this model, we first tested
the efficacy of single-copy shRNAs targeting mouse
PHGDH in NIH3T3 cells (Supplementary Figure 1).
shRNA #3 was selected, cloned into a col1A1 targeting
vector for recombination-mediated cassette exchange in
embryonic stem cells, and used to generate shPHGDH
mice.
Mice
expressing
Renilla
luciferase
targeting
shRNA (shREN) were used as controls [35].
shREN and shPHGDH mice were crossed with a ubi-
quitous reverse tetracycline transactivator allele (rtTA3)
to allow for whole body expression of the shRNA upon
doxycycline administration. We selected the CAGs-
rtTA3 allele, which demonstrated robust rtTA3 expres-
sion and activity in the pancreas, liver, kidney, small
intestine, large intestine, skin, thymus, and bone mar-
row, although limited activity was observed in the spleen
[10]. Further, because doxycycline levels achieved in the
mouse brain are an order of magnitude lower than in
plasma [23], this model is expected to spare the brain
and avoid the previously reported brain toxicity associ-
ated with PHGDH knockout. shRNA, rtTA3 dual allele
mice were placed on a 200 ppm doxycycline-containing
diet containing serine and glycine. As expected, western
blot analysis of PHGDH expression in tissues revealed
that PHGDH knockdown was achieved in the pancreas,
liver, and large intestine (Fig. 1b–d), but was absent in
the brain and spleen (Fig. 1e, Supplemental Figure 2).
Serum serine levels were decreased by approximately
20% following PHGDH knockdown (Fig. 1f), with the
remaining 80% likely accounted for by dietary serine and
glycine. These results demonstrate that our inducible
PHGDH knockdown model spares brain and spleen
PHGDH but diminishes PHGDH in other tissues where
rtTA3 is robustly expressed, resulting in a reduction in
circulating serine.
PHGDH knockdown impairs serine synthesis in vivo
We next validated that PHGDH knockdown impaired
serine synthesis in vivo. To this end, we performed
in vivo glucose tracing using uniformly labeled 13C-glu-
cose (U-13C-glucose), which is metabolized to
13C-3-
phosphoglycerate via glycolysis and subsequently to 13C-
serine via PHGDH and the serine synthesis pathway.
shPHGDH and shREN mice were implanted with jugular
catheters to facilitate glucose infusions on active mice,
allowed to recover, and fasted overnight prior to infu-
sions. Infusion with
13C-glucose for 2.5 h resulted in

robust labeling of serum glucose with no apparent differ-
ence in labeling between shPHGDH and shREN animals
(Fig. 2a). This translated to robust tissue labeling of glu-
cose in the pancreas, brain, and liver (Fig. 2b–d), with no
difference
in
glucose
labeling
observed
between
shPHGDH and shREN animals. Liver glucose labeling
was lower than other tissues, possibly due to gluconeo-
genesis in this organ. Importantly, shPHGDH animals
demonstrated a reduction in serine labeling from glucose
in the pancreas and liver, but not the brain (Fig. 2e–g).
The reduction in serine labeling in the pancreas was
greater than the liver, consistent with the robust knock-
down achieved in the pancreas compared to liver (Fig. 1b,
d). These results demonstrate that tissues with PHGDH
knockdown have impaired serine synthesis proportional
to the degree of protein knockdown achieved.
PHGDH is not required for tissue proliferation and mouse
viability
We next assessed the consequence of PHGDH depletion
on
animal
health
and
viability.
Mice
expressing
shPHGDH were found to have a normal lifespan, with
only a modest, non-significant reduction in survival
compared to shREN mice (Fig. 3a). Because PHGDH has
been associated with proliferation in neoplastic cells, we
determined the effects of PHGDH silencing on the most
proliferative tissues in adult mice. First, we examined the
health of the intestine, which contains highly prolifera-
tive stem cells in the crypt, which must replace the en-
tire epithelium every few days. We found that mice
gained weight at normal rates, and intestines exhibited a
normal morphology and proliferation rate (Fig. 3b, c).
Next, we examined the hematopoietic cells in the bone

marrow. We found no overtly abnormal phenotypes in
the bone marrow of shPHGDH mice in the absence of
stress (Fig. 3d). Further, shPHGDH mice had normal red
blood cell and white blood cell counts (Fig. 3e, f). How-
ever, this may be explained by low basal PHGDH ex-
pression in the bulk bone marrow population, which
was undetectable by western blot (not shown). Finally,
because PHGDH knockdown was very robust in the
pancreas, we examined the consequence of PHGDH de-
pletion on glucose tolerance. shREN and shPHGDH
mice were administered a bolus of glucose in an oral
glucose tolerance test, and blood glucose was assayed

over time. We found that glucose tolerance was not af-
fected by PHGDH knockdown (Fig. 3g), suggesting that
PHGDH is not required for normal pancreatic function.
Further, PHGDH knockdown in the liver did not affect
liver function as determined by blood markers for liver
enzymes and other liver markers (Supplementary Figure
3). Collectively, these results demonstrate that PHGDH
is not required for the cellular proliferation or normal
function of multiple tissues in adult mice, which present
with no overtly abnormal phenotypes upon PHGDH
knockdown.
shPHGDH mice do not exhibit deoxysphingolipid
formation
In addition to the importance of serine for the prolifera-
tion of neoplastic and non-neoplastic cells, low serine
levels have been linked with toxic deoxysphingolipid for-
mation in both serine deprivation experiments [13] and
PHGDH knockout brains [11]. When serine levels are
low, deoxysphingolipids are made via serine palmitoyl-
transferase (SPT) using alanine as a substrate instead of
serine, thereby leading to deoxysphingolipid accumula-
tion and cellular toxicity, particularly in the central ner-
vous system. To examine the effect of PHGDH depletion
on deoxysphingolipid metabolism, we first examined
deoxysphingolipid levels in the circulation. However, we
found no accumulation of individual (Fig. 4a) or total
(Fig. 4b) dihydro-deoxy (dihydro-dox) or the deoxy (dox)
sphingolipid species in the serum of shPHGDH mice.
Similarly, liver deoxysphingolipid levels were not altered
(Fig. 4c), with the levels of dihydro-deoxysphingolipids
actually significantly lower upon PHGDH knockdown
(Fig. 4d). Finally, the levels of the deoxysphingolipid pre-
cursor deoxysphinganine was not elevated in liver (Fig.
4e). These results demonstrate that the decrease in circu-
lating serine
following
PHGDH
knockdown
is
not
sufficient to induce deoxysphingolipid formation.
PHGDH knockdown decreases serum and liver ceramides
Importantly, the canonical product of the SPT pathway,
ceramide, can also be influenced by serine availability
[14]. Interestingly, and in agreement with a previous re-
port demonstrating that serine limitation depletes cer-
amide [14], we observe a decrease in many ceramide
species in the serum of shPHGDH mice (Fig. 5a). Con-
sistent with what was observed in the serum, liver cera-
mides
were
also
significantly
decreased
(Fig.
5b).
Analysis of liver serine levels revealed a decrease by ap-
proximately 20% (Fig. 5c), similar to what was observed
in the serum (Fig. 1e). Collectively, these results demon-
strate that PHGDH knockdown influences ceramide
levels in vivo, consistent with prior studies describing
effects of serine availability on ceramide metabolism.
PHGDH knockdown alters triacylglycerol composition
We next examined whether impaired sphingolipid syn-
thesis influenced other lipid classes. Multiple lipid clas-
ses, such as sphingolipids, glycerophospholipids, and
triacylglycerols, share similar fatty acid tails, with distinct
lipid head groups. Lipidomics analysis of shREN and
shPHGDH serum and liver revealed global lipid alter-
ations (Fig. 6a, b, Supplementary Tables 2 and 3),
suggesting a perturbation in lipid metabolism following
PHGDH knockdown. In particular, we observed a sig-
nificant accumulation of certain triacylglycerol (TAG)
species, particularly in the liver (Fig. 6). However, total
TAG levels in the serum and liver were unchanged (Fig.
6c, d). Rather, it was the composition of the TAG spe-
cies that was altered. Specifically, accumulated TAG
species were enriched in long chain (LC) polyunsatur-
ated fatty acid (PUFA) tails, while short chain saturated
TAGs were decreased (Fig. 6e). Further, lipidomics ana-
lysis of fatty acyl carnitine species revealed a significant
decrease in C12:0-, C12:1-, C16:0-, C18:0-, and C20:1-
carnitine species, suggesting a decrease in fatty acids
availability for β-oxidation (Fig. 6f). In contrast, serine,
ceramide, and TAG lipids were unaltered in the brain
upon PHGDH knockdown (Supplemental Figure 4, Sup-
plementary Table 4). These results demonstrate that
PHGDH knockdown alters fatty acyl-carnitine levels and
TAG composition in liver but does not affect total TAG
levels.
Discussion
Genetic deficiency in the de novo serine biosynthesis
genes PHGDH, PSAT1, and PSPH, in humans causes
Neu-Laxova syndrome (NLS), a very rare autosomal re-
cessive congenital disorder [1, 37]. Severity is dictated by

the degree of pathway activity loss, and most patients
are affected from infancy. NLS patients present with
central
nervous
system
(CNS)
symptoms
including
microcephaly, impaired motor function, epilepsy, and
perinatal lethality. By contrast, we find that PHGDH de-
pletion in non-cerebral tissues following the postnatal
period results in no overt phenotype, which is consistent
with the symptoms of PHGDH deficiency being predom-
inantly localized to the CNS.
Our model is useful for the study of PHGDH in adult
tissues, but it has some limitations. First, off-target effects
are a concern with shRNAs. Second, knockdown is not
complete in all tissues studied. While we could achieve
better knockdown in some tissues with a diet containing
625 ppm doxycycline (not shown), concerns about the ef-
fects of doxycycline on metabolism led us to choose a
lower concentration. Doxycyline suppresses the expres-
sion of oxidative phosphorylation genes and shifts metab-
olism to a more glycolytic phenotype [2], which could
potentially mask mitochondrial metabolism-dependent
phenotypes. Improved PHGDH depletion in some tissues
may also be improved through the use of other rtTA3

alleles that have higher promoter activity in those tissues.
Consequently, caution must be used when interpreting
our results on the effect of PHGDH knockdown in all
tissues because it is possible some cell types still have
abundant PHGDH expression due to poor shRNA expres-
sion. Despite this limitation, our model is likely to more
accurately model the effects of PHGDH inhibition in se-
lect tissues compared to whole body knockout due to the
incomplete and transient nature of inhibition of enzymes
by small molecules. While there have been many PHGDH
inhibitors reported to date [29, 30, 33, 43, 44], only NTC-
503, PKUMDL-WQ-2101, and PKUMDL-WQ-2201 have
been used in vivo, and to our knowledge, their efficacy
and long-term toxicity in various tissues have not been
characterized. The future comparison between shRNA
and pharmacological inhibition will provide important
insight into the contribution of PHGDH to normal tissue
homeostasis and metabolism.
Our findings suggest that PHGDH inhibitors that can-
not cross the blood-brain barrier may be well tolerated,
provided adequate
serine
and
glycine
are
supplied
through the diet. While liver lipid metabolism was al-
tered, this did not appear to induce any pathology in
the absence of stress. While we observed alterations in
lipid levels in the serum and liver, we cannot exclude
the possibility that decreased PHGDH-derived serine
from another organ accounts for the decrease in
serum and liver serine. It has been suggested that the
kidney is the primary site of serine synthesis in
humans and rats, with the liver contributing only
under protein-deficient conditions [16]. Specialized di-
ets lacking serine and glycine could be used to both
compare with PHGDH knockdown, and reveal the
importance of PHGDH to tissue homeostasis and me-
tabolism under serine-limiting conditions. In addition,
methionine/choline-deficient
diets
could
be
used,
given the importance of serine to the folate and me-
thionine cycles and high-fat diets could help dissect
the lipid phenotype in the liver.
Our findings demonstrating that PHGDH knockdown
results in a depletion of ceramides are very similar to
findings seen with serine starvation in colon cancer cells,

where ceramide depletion also led to loss of mitochon-
drial function, suggesting that mitochondrial function
may also be impaired in our model as well. Interestingly,
inhibition of mitochondrial function was recently found
to induce the synthesis of highly unsaturated fatty acids
(HUFA) to recycle glycolytic NAD+ [19]. Alternatively,
altered TAG metabolism in our model may be a conse-
quence
of
decreased
Palmitoyl-CoA
utilization
for
sphingolipid synthesis. Recently, transgenic PHGDH
overexpression was found to significantly reduce hepatic
TAG accumulation on a high fat diet [38], further sup-
porting a role for PHGDH in liver TAG metabolism.
Fatty acid incorporation into TAGs has been shown to
protect against lipotoxicity in many settings [5, 21].
Further work is needed to determine whether shPHGDH
livers have mitochondrial impairment, and whether al-
terations in TAG metabolism protect shPHGDH livers.
Conclusions
Our study found that PHGDH knockdown has a modest
effect on circulating serine in the presence of dietary
serine/glycine and does not affect the function or prolif-
eration of adult pancreas, liver, and intestine. However,
loss of PHGDH expression reduced liver and serum
ceramide levels without increasing the levels of deoxy-
sphingolipids. Further, liver triacylglycerol profiles were
altered, with an accumulation of longer-chained, polyun-
saturated tails upon PHGDH knockdown. Collectively,

these results suggest that PHGDH-derived serine sup-
ports liver ceramide synthesis and sustains general lipid
homeostasis.
