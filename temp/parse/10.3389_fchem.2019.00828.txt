Here we report a new class of synthetic receptors, acyclic pillar[ n ]naphthalene (  n = 2–4,  Dimer ,  Trimer , and  Tetramer ) oligomers, which are made up of 2,3-diethoxynaphthalene units linked by methylene bridges at the 1- and 4-positions. They can be synthesized through a one-step condensation of 2,3-diethoxynaphthalene monomer and paraformaldehyde in the presence of BF  3 •(Et)  2 O catalyst. The crystal structure of  Tetramer has an interesting pseudo-cycle shaped structure in the solid state. Their complexation behaviors toward several organic ammonium cations (  1  + -  15  + ) and electron–deficient neutral guests (  16 –  17 ), were examined by means of  1 H NMR spectroscopy.  Tetramer shows good host-guest properties toward the ammonium guests, giving association constants (  K  a ) in the magnitude of 10  2 -10  4 M  −1 , which are comparable with those for some macrocyclic hosts. 

  pillararenes  calixarenes  acyclic hosts  molecular recognition  host-guest chemistry                  Introduction  Since the discover of crown ethers, the development of hosts for recognizing various guest species has mainly focused on macrocyclic structures (Cram, 1988 ; Lehn,  1988 ; Pedersen,  1988 ; Gong et al.,  2010 ; Chun et al.,  2013 ; Jurícek et al.,  2014 ; Liu et al.,  2019 ). Methylene–bridged macrocyclic arenes, for example calixarenes (Baldini et al.,  2007 ; Guo and Liu,  2012 ), pillararenes (Ogoshi et al.,  2008 ; Xue et al.,  2012 ; Wang et al.,  2016 ; Yang et al.,  2016 ), coronarenes (Wang,  2018 ), helic[6]arene (Zhang et al.,  2016 ), biphenarenes (Chen et al.,  2015 ; Dai et al.,  2017 ; Li et al.,  2019 ; Wang et al.,  2019b ), and etc. (Guo et al.,  2018 ; Luo et al.,  2018 ; Ma et al.,  2018 ) have been widely used in host-guest chemistry, self-assembly materials, and biomedical field (Song and Yang,  2015 ; Alsbaiee et al.,  2016 ; Li et al.,  2017 ; Jie et al.,  2018 ; Chen et al.,  2019 ; Yang et al.,  2019 ). Naphthalene-based macrocyclic arenes, termed as calixnaphthalenes, have also been produced (Poh et al.,  1989 ; Andreetti et al.,  1993 ; Shorthill et al.,  2004 ; AlHujran et al.,  2012 ; Avetta et al.,  2012 ). However, calixnaphthalenes have not become highly popular receptors because they do not have unique molecular recognition properties. Considering that pillararenes with pillar-shape topologic structures have shown nice host-guest properties, we wondered whether we can create acyclic pillarnaphthalenes (  Scheme 1 ), which would have deep, pillar-shape, and π-rich cavities, and maybe better binding abilities than calixnaphthalenes. As detailed below, we did not get such macrocycles, but succeed in making acyclic pillarnaphthalene oligomers. 

 Scheme 1  Structures of pillar[ n ]arenes and our designed pillar[  n ]naphthalenes. 

     Acyclic hosts that contain partially enclosed cavities capable of binding guests provided alternatives with unique synthetic and functional advantages (Goodman et al., 2007 ; Seebach and Gardiner,  2008 ; Pan et al.,  2017 ; Wang et al.,  2019a ). For example, foldamers may provide cavities that are adaptive in recognizing different guest molecules (Zhang et al.,  2012 ; Yashima et al.,  2016 ). Molecular tweezers have made the way from a supramolecular host to a drug candidate, due to their ability to inhibit peptide and protein aggregation through the complexation toward amino acids (Sinha et al.,  2011 ; Schrader et al.,  2016 ). 

 Isaacs and his co-workers created acyclic cucurbit[ n ]uril-type receptors, which can function as solubilizing agents for insoluble drugs. Interestingly, the solubility of paclitaxel was increased 2,750 times through the formation of soluble container–drug complex (Ma et al.,  2012 ). These highly soluble acyclic cucurbiturils could also solubilize individual single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) in water even at a concentration 100–1,000 times lower than typically required for surfactants (Shen et al.,  2012 ). The groups of Schrader and Yoshizawa synthesized beautiful water-soluble clip and tweezer-shaped hosts based on norbornene and anthracene building blocks (Bier et al.,  2013 ; Jono et al.,  2017 ). 

 Herein, we wish to report the synthesis of a new type of receptors, acyclic pillar[ n ]naphthalene (  n = 2–4,  Dimer ,  Trimer , and  Tetramer ) oligomers, which are made up of 2,3-diethoxynaphthalene units linked by methylene bridges at the 1- and 4-positions.  Tetramer , bearing a pseudo-cavity, has good host-guest properties toward a series of model organic cationic guests. 

  Materials and Methods  All the reagents involved in this research were commercially available and used without further purification unless otherwise noted. 1 H NMR,  13 C NMR, 2D NOESY, and COSY spectra (see  Supplementary Material ) were recorded with a Bruker AVANCE III 500 MHz instrument. Chemical shifts were referred to TMS. Highresolution mass spectra (HRMS) were determined on a Bruker Daltonics, Inc. APEXIII 7.0 TESLA FTMS instrument. The single crystal X-ray data were measured by direct methods using SHELXS-971 and refined by fullmatrix least-squares procedures on F2 with SHELXL-97.2. All non-hydrogen atoms were obtained from the difference Fourier map and subjected to anisotropic refinement by full-matrix least squares on F2. Hydrogen atoms were obtained geometrically and treated as riding on the parent atoms or were constrained in the locations during refinements. Test parameters and detailed experimental data are shown in the  Supplementary Material . 

 Synthesis and Characterization  To the solution of 2,3-diethoxy naphthalene (2.6 g, 12 mmol) in CHCl 3 (150 mL) was added paraformaldehyde (0.36 g, 12 mmol). Boron trifluoride diethyl etherate (2.5 ml, 20 mmol) was then added to the reaction mixture. The mixture was stirred at 25°C for 1 h. Then the reaction was quenched by addition of 50 mL water. The organic phase was separated and washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO  3 , and water. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na  2 SO  4 and concentrated. The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (eluent: 1/1,  v/v , dichloromethane: petrol ether) to afford  Dimer (21%),  Trimer (9%), and  Tetramer (15%), as white solids.

   Results and Discussion  2,3-Diethoxy naphthalene was selected as the building block to condense with paraformaldehyde. Due to the electron-donating ethoxy groups, great regioselectivity can be rationalized, and the reactive sites should be 1- and 4-positions in Friedel–Crafts reaction. It was expected to produce pillar-shape macrocycles, pillar[ n ]naphthalenes. However, no cyclic oligomers have been obtained after many attempts; a possible reason is that big naphthalene units make the final cyclization quite difficult due to the steric hindrance. Fortunately, we got acyclic pillar[  n ]naphthalenes (  n = 2–4). 

 Using BF 3 ·(Et)  2 O as the catalyst, the condensation reaction of 2,3-diethoxy naphthalene and paraformaldehyde in CHCl  3 at room temperature (  Scheme 2 ) produced oligomers  Dimer ,  Trimer , and  Tetramer with yields of 21, 9, and 15%, respectively. Other Lewis acid catalysts, for example TfOH, FeCl  3 , and AlCl  3 , could also work, but the reaction yields were lower than that for BF  3 ·(Et)  2 O. The synthesis was considerably easy since it just involved a one–step reaction of commercial starting materials and the isolation was also convenient by column chromatography on silica gel. 

 Scheme 2  Synthesis of acyclic pillar[ n ]naphthalenes  Dimer ,  Trimer , and  Tetramer . 

     Dimer ,  Trimer , and  Tetramer were well characterized by  1 H NMR,  13 C NMR, NOESY, and COSY spectra (  Figure 1 and  Supplementary Figures 1 –  11 ), and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). They have rather complex patterns of aromatic and ethoxy peaks in  1 H NMR spectra (  Figure 1 ) because they are not highly symmetrical macrocycles, but acyclic oligomers with low symmetry. 

 Figure 1  1 H NMR spectra (500 MHz, 2.0 mM, CDCl  3 ) of  Dimer ,  Trimer , and  Tetramer . 

     Single crystals of Dimer, Trimer , and  Tetramer suitable for X-ray analysis were obtained by diffusion of hexane into a solution of the compounds in dichloromethane at room temperature (  Figure 2 ). As expected, these three acyclic oligomers had the same connecting style, i.e., 2,3-diethoxy naphthalene units were connected by methylene at 1,4-positions. As shown in  Figures 2A,B , the acyclic  Dimer and  Trimer , possessing two and three naphthalene moieties, have ill–defined cavities. Particularly, the  Tetramer exhibits a pseudocycle–shaped structure, with all the methylene bridges being orientated outwardly. There exist intramolecular sextuple C–H···π interactions, with H···ring center distances of 2.75–3.23 Å (  Supplementary Figure 12 ), between the middle two ethoxy groups and naphthalenes, resulting in the formation of a pseudo cycle rather than a zigzag structure. More interestingly, the single crystal structures of  Tetramer molecules exist in a pair of enantiomers in the solid state (  Figure 2D ).

     The host-guest properties of the acyclic receptors were then tested. Since they possess π-rich cavities, several cationic guests ( 1  + -  15  + ) and electron–deficient neutral guests (  16 –  17 ) (  Scheme 3 ) were chosen as model guest molecules to investigate their host-guest chemistry. In most cases, CDCl  3 was used as solvent during the  1 H NMR experiments of host-guest mixture and following NMR titrations; for guests  7  2+   , 9  2+  , and  10  2+  , CD  2 Cl  2 was used because of their poor solubility in CDCl  3 . 

 Scheme 3  Structures of guest molecules. The counter anions of 1  + -  15  + are tetrakis[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl] borate (BArF  − ). 

     Figure 3 shows the  1 H NMR spectra recorded for quarternary ammonium guest  1  +  in the absence and presence of  Tetramer . As can be readily seen, upon addition of  Tetramer , protons H  a , H  b and H  c of  1  +  display substantial upfield shifts (Δδ = −0.39, −0.29, and −0.21 ppm) due to complexation–induced shielding effects, indicating that  1  +  was located inside the acyclic host's pseudo-cavity to form a host-guest inclusion complex, and the main binding site is the N  + (Me)  3 moiety. In contrast, protons H  h−i undergo indistinct NMR changes, suggesting they are located outside the cavity of  Tetramer . [24] In the NOESY spectrum of  1  +  and  Tetramer , NOE correlations were observed between methyl protons H  a of the guest and the aromatic protons H  5 , H  7 and H  8 of  Tetramer , also suggesting the host-guest encapsulation (  Supplementary Figure 13 ). The formation of  1  +  •  Tetramer complex was further supported by ESI mass spectrometry analysis of an equimolar mixture of  1 •BArF and  Tetramer , where an intense peak for the 1:1 complex (  m /  z 1072.66, calcd. for  1  +  •  Tetramer = 1072.67) was observed (  Supplementary Figure 14 ). The encapsulation could also be rationalized by energy-minimized molecular modeling (  Figure 3D ): the oligomers wrapped around the guest to enhance the host-guest contacts driven by cation···π/ C–H···π interactions.

     The addition of Dimer and  Trimer could also induce the upfield shifts of guest  1  +  , but the Δδ values are smaller than those for  Tetramer (  Supplementary Figure 15 ). These results indicated relatively weak binding interactions occurred for  Dimer and  Trimer in comparison with  Tetramer . These observations were consistent with the association constants (  K  a ) obtained from  1 H NMR titration experiments. As shown in  Table 1 , the  K  a value of  1  + with  Tetramer [(4.4±0.6) × 10  2 M  −1 ] is 18 times larger than that for  Trimer , and the affinity for  Dimer was too small to be accurately calculated (< 5 M  −1 ).

 a  The K a values were determined by NMR titrations (  Supplementary Figure 30 )  . 

  b  The K a value was too small (<5 M  −1 ) to be accurately calculated  . 

  c  No interactions were found ( Supplementary Figures 28, 29 )  . 

    Since Tetramer showed interesting structure and good recognition behavior, we then examined its binding capacity toward other cationic guests (  Table 1 and  Supplementary Figures 16–29 ), revealing that  Tetramer can form host–guest complexes with them but the binding affinities are totally different. For the trimethyl ammonium guests  1  + -  6  + ,  3  +  [  K  a = (1.2 ± 0.2) × 10  3 M  −1 ] and  4  +  [  K  a = (2.1±0.4) × 10  3 M  −1 ] bearing naphthyl moieties give stronger affinities, which should be due to host-guest fitted π ··· π interactions and large contacts. The substitution of naphthyl for smaller phenyl or bigger pyrenyl in  3  +  and  4  +  , affording  1  +  or  5  +  , considerably decreases the association constants by one order of magnitude. 

 Binding affinities of Tetramer toward primary ammonium guests  11  +  –  13  +  were stronger than those of the corresponding quaternary ammonium guests  1  +  –  3  +  . For example, the  K  a value of  Tetramer and octylammonium  11  +  [(2.5±0.4) × 10  4 M  −1 ] is about 56-fold higher than that for trimethyloctylammonium  1  +  [(4.4±0.6) × 10  2 M  −1 ]. Similarly, the selectivity factors of  12  +  /  2  +  and  13  +  /  2  +  are 15 and 12, respectively. The reason for such high selectivity would be that big and spherical N  + (Me)  3 group is too larger compared with  Tetramer 's size, and small  NH   3   +     is a suitable one. It should be noted that the binding affinities of  Tetramer and organic ammonium salts, with  K  a values in the magnitude of 10  2 -10  4 M  −1 , are comparable to those for macrocyclic arenes such as pillararenes and biphenarenes. 

 Due to its π-electron rich cavity, the complexation of Tetramer and two π-deficient neutral guests,  16 and  17 , were also investigated. From  Supplementary Figures 28, 29 , no obvious NMR changes were detected, indicating no stable complexes can be formed. 

  Conclusions  In summary, acyclic pillarnaphthalenes with 2,3-diethoxynaphthalene units bridged by methylenes at 1,4-positions were synthesized through a one-pot reaction of 2,3-diethoxy naphthalene monomer and paraformaldehyde by using Lewis acid as the catalyst. Acyclic pillar[4]naphthalene Tetramer is able to interact organic ammonium guests cations by wrapping around them, giving association constants in the magnitude of 10  2 -10  4 M  −1 . We expect that  Tetramer bearing pseudo-cycle cavity, could have significant potential for the applications in host-guest chemistry and self-assembly.
