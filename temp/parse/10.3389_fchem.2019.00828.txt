Here we report a new class of synthetic receptors, acyclic pillar[n]naphthalene
(n = 2–4, Dimer, Trimer, and Tetramer) oligomers, which are made up of
2,3-diethoxynaphthalene units linked by methylene bridges at the 1- and 4-positions.
They can be synthesized through a one-step condensation of 2,3-diethoxynaphthalene
monomer and paraformaldehyde in the presence of BF3•(Et)2O catalyst. The crystal
structure of Tetramer has an interesting pseudo-cycle shaped structure in the solid
state. Their complexation behaviors toward several organic ammonium cations (1+-15+)
and electron–deﬁcient neutral guests (16–17), were examined by means of 1H NMR
spectroscopy. Tetramer shows good host-guest properties toward the ammonium
guests, giving association constants (Ka) in the magnitude of 102-104 M−1, which are
comparable with those for some macrocyclic hosts.

INTRODUCTION
Since the discover of crown ethers, the development of hosts for recognizing various guest species
has mainly focused on macrocyclic structures (Cram, 1988; Lehn, 1988; Pedersen, 1988; Gong
et al., 2010; Chun et al., 2013; Jurícek et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2019). Methylene–bridged macrocyclic
arenes, for example calixarenes (Baldini et al., 2007; Guo and Liu, 2012), pillararenes (Ogoshi
et al., 2008; Xue et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2016), coronarenes (Wang, 2018),
helic[6]arene (Zhang et al., 2016), biphenarenes (Chen et al., 2015; Dai et al., 2017; Li et al.,
2019; Wang et al., 2019b), and etc. (Guo et al., 2018; Luo et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2018) have been
widely used in host-guest chemistry, self-assembly materials, and biomedical ﬁeld (Song and Yang,
2015; Alsbaiee et al., 2016; Li et al., 2017; Jie et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019).
Naphthalene-based macrocyclic arenes, termed as calixnaphthalenes, have also been produced
(Poh et al., 1989; Andreetti et al., 1993; Shorthill et al., 2004; AlHujran et al., 2012; Avetta et al.,
2012). However, calixnaphthalenes have not become highly popular receptors because they do
not have unique molecular recognition properties. Considering that pillararenes with pillar-shape
topologic structures have shown nice host-guest properties, we wondered whether we can create
acyclic pillarnaphthalenes (Scheme 1), which would have deep, pillar-shape, and π-rich cavities,
and maybe better binding abilities than calixnaphthalenes. As detailed below, we did not get such
macrocycles, but succeed in making acyclic pillarnaphthalene oligomers.
Acyclic hosts that contain partially enclosed cavities capable of binding guests provided
alternatives with unique synthetic and functional advantages (Goodman et al., 2007; Seebach and
Gardiner, 2008; Pan et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019a). For example, foldamers may provide cavities
that are adaptive in recognizing diﬀerent guest molecules (Zhang et al., 2012; Yashima et al., 2016).

Molecular tweezers have made the way from a supramolecular
host to a drug candidate, due to their ability to inhibit peptide
and protein aggregation through the complexation toward amino
acids (Sinha et al., 2011; Schrader et al., 2016).
Isaacs and his co-workers created acyclic cucurbit[n]uril-
type receptors, which can function as solubilizing agents
for insoluble drugs. Interestingly, the solubility of paclitaxel
was increased 2,750 times through the formation of soluble
container–drug complex (Ma et al., 2012). These highly soluble
acyclic cucurbiturils could also solubilize individual single-walled
carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) in water even at a concentration
100–1,000 times lower than typically required for surfactants
(Shen et al., 2012). The groups of Schrader and Yoshizawa
synthesized beautiful water-soluble clip and tweezer-shaped hosts
based on norbornene and anthracene building blocks (Bier et al.,
2013; Jono et al., 2017).
Herein, we wish to report the synthesis of a new type
of receptors, acyclic pillar[n]naphthalene (n = 2–4, Dimer,
Trimer, and Tetramer) oligomers, which are made up of 2,3-
diethoxynaphthalene units linked by methylene bridges at the
1- and 4-positions. Tetramer, bearing a pseudo-cavity, has
good host-guest properties toward a series of model organic
cationic guests.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
All the reagents involved in this research were commercially
available and used without further puriﬁcation unless otherwise
noted. 1H NMR, 13C NMR, 2D NOESY, and COSY spectra (see
Supplementary Material) were recorded with a Bruker AVANCE
III 500 MHz instrument. Chemical shifts were referred to TMS.
Highresolution mass spectra (HRMS) were determined on a
Bruker Daltonics, Inc. APEXIII 7.0 TESLA FTMS instrument.
The single crystal X-ray data were measured by direct methods
using SHELXS-971 and reﬁned by fullmatrix least-squares
procedures on F2 with SHELXL-97.2. All non-hydrogen atoms
were obtained from the diﬀerence Fourier map and subjected
to anisotropic reﬁnement by full-matrix least squares on F2.
Hydrogen atoms were obtained geometrically and treated as
riding on the parent atoms or were constrained in the locations
during reﬁnements. Test parameters and detailed experimental
data are shown in the Supplementary Material.
Synthesis and Characterization
To the solution of 2,3-diethoxy naphthalene (2.6 g, 12 mmol)
in CHCl3 (150 mL) was added paraformaldehyde (0.36 g, 12
mmol). Boron triﬂuoride diethyl etherate (2.5 ml, 20 mmol) was
then added to the reaction mixture. The mixture was stirred at
25◦C for 1 h. Then the reaction was quenched by addition of
50 mL water. The organic phase was separated and washed with
saturated aqueous NaHCO3, and water. The organic layer was
dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated. The residue was
puriﬁed by column chromatography on silica gel (eluent: 1/1, v/v,
dichloromethane: petrol ether) to aﬀord Dimer (21%), Trimer
(9%), and Tetramer (15%), as white solids.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
2,3-Diethoxy naphthalene was selected as the building block to
condense with paraformaldehyde. Due to the electron-donating
ethoxy groups, great regioselectivity can be rationalized, and
the reactive sites should be 1- and 4-positions in Friedel–Crafts
reaction. It was expected to produce pillar-shape macrocycles,
pillar[n]naphthalenes. However, no cyclic oligomers have been
obtained after many attempts; a possible reason is that big

naphthalene units make the ﬁnal cyclization quite diﬃcult
due to the steric hindrance. Fortunately, we got acyclic
pillar[n]naphthalenes (n = 2–4).
Using BF3·(Et)2O as the catalyst, the condensation reaction
of 2,3-diethoxy naphthalene and paraformaldehyde in CHCl3
at room temperature (Scheme 2) produced oligomers Dimer,
Trimer, and Tetramer with yields of 21, 9, and 15%, respectively.
Other Lewis acid catalysts, for example TfOH, FeCl3, and AlCl3,
could also work, but the reaction yields were lower than that
for BF3·(Et)2O. The synthesis was considerably easy since it just
involved a one–step reaction of commercial starting materials
and the isolation was also convenient by column chromatography
on silica gel.
Dimer, Trimer, and Tetramer were well characterized by
1H NMR, 13C NMR, NOESY, and COSY spectra (Figure 1
and Supplementary Figures 1–11), and high-resolution mass
spectrometry (HRMS). They have rather complex patterns of
aromatic and ethoxy peaks in 1H NMR spectra (Figure 1)
because they are not highly symmetrical macrocycles, but acyclic
oligomers with low symmetry.
Single crystals of Dimer, Trimer, and Tetramer suitable for X-
ray analysis were obtained by diﬀusion of hexane into a solution

of the compounds in dichloromethane at room temperature
(Figure 2). As expected, these three acyclic oligomers had
the same connecting style, i.e., 2,3-diethoxy naphthalene units
were connected by methylene at 1,4-positions. As shown in
Figures 2A,B, the acyclic Dimer and Trimer, possessing two and
three naphthalene moieties, have ill–deﬁned cavities. Particularly,
the Tetramer exhibits a pseudocycle–shaped structure, with
all the methylene bridges being orientated outwardly. There
exist intramolecular sextuple C–H···π interactions, with H···ring
center distances of 2.75–3.23 Å (Supplementary Figure 12),
between the middle two ethoxy groups and naphthalenes,
resulting in the formation of a pseudo cycle rather than a zigzag
structure. More interestingly, the single crystal structures of
Tetramer molecules exist in a pair of enantiomers in the solid
state (Figure 2D).
The host-guest properties of the acyclic receptors were
then tested. Since they possess π-rich cavities, several cationic
guests (1+-15+) and electron–deﬁcient neutral guests (16–17)
(Scheme 3) were chosen as model guest molecules to investigate
their host-guest chemistry. In most cases, CDCl3 was used as
solvent during the 1H NMR experiments of host-guest mixture
and following NMR titrations; for guests 72+, 92+, and 102+,
CD2Cl2 was used because of their poor solubility in CDCl3.
Figure 3 shows the 1H NMR spectra recorded for quarternary
ammonium guest 1+ in the absence and presence of Tetramer.
As can be readily seen, upon addition of Tetramer, protons
Ha, Hb and Hc of 1+ display substantial upﬁeld shifts (1δ =
−0.39, −0.29, and −0.21 ppm) due to complexation–induced
shielding eﬀects, indicating that 1+ was located inside the acyclic
host’s pseudo-cavity to form a host-guest inclusion complex,
and the main binding site is the N+(Me)3 moiety. In contrast,
protons Hh−i undergo indistinct NMR changes, suggesting
they are located outside the cavity of Tetramer. [24] In the
NOESY spectrum of 1+ and Tetramer, NOE correlations were
observed between methyl protons Ha of the guest and the
aromatic protons H5, H7 and H8 of Tetramer, also suggesting
the host-guest encapsulation (Supplementary Figure 13). The
formation of 1+•Tetramer complex was further supported by
ESI mass spectrometry analysis of an equimolar mixture of
1•BArF and Tetramer, where an intense peak for the 1:1
complex (m/z 1072.66, calcd. for 1+•Tetramer = 1072.67)
was observed (Supplementary Figure 14). The encapsulation
could also be rationalized by energy-minimized molecular
modeling (Figure 3D): the oligomers wrapped around the guest
to enhance the host-guest contacts driven by cation···π/ C–
H···π interactions.
The addition of Dimer and Trimer could also induce the
upﬁeld shifts of guest 1+, but the 1δ values are smaller
than those for Tetramer (Supplementary Figure 15). These
results indicated relatively weak binding interactions occurred
for Dimer and Trimer in comparison with Tetramer. These
observations were consistent with the association constants
(Ka) obtained from 1H NMR titration experiments. As shown
in Table 1, the Ka value of 1+ with Tetramer [(4.4±0.6)
× 102
M−1] is 18 times larger than that for Trimer,
and the aﬃnity for Dimer was too small to be accurately
calculated (< 5 M−1).

(2.1±0.4) × 103 M−1] bearing naphthyl moieties give stronger
aﬃnities, which should be due to host-guest ﬁtted π · · · π
interactions and large contacts. The substitution of naphthyl for
smaller phenyl or bigger pyrenyl in 3+ and 4+, aﬀording 1+
or 5+, considerably decreases the association constants by one
order of magnitude.
Binding aﬃnities of Tetramer toward primary ammonium
guests 11+–13+ were stronger than those of the corresponding
quaternary ammonium guests 1+–3+. For example, the Ka value
of Tetramer and octylammonium 11+ [(2.5±0.4) × 104 M−1]
is about 56-fold higher than that for trimethyloctylammonium
1+ [(4.4±0.6) × 102 M−1]. Similarly, the selectivity factors of
12+/2+ and 13+/2+ are 15 and 12, respectively. The reason
for such high selectivity would be that big and spherical
N+(Me)3 group is too larger compared with Tetramer’s size,
and small NH+
3
is a suitable one. It should be noted that
the binding aﬃnities of Tetramer and organic ammonium
salts, with Ka values in the magnitude of 102-104 M−1, are
comparable to those for macrocyclic arenes such as pillararenes
and biphenarenes.
Due to its π-electron rich cavity, the complexation of
Tetramer and two π-deﬁcient neutral guests, 16 and 17,
were also investigated. From Supplementary Figures 28, 29, no
obvious NMR changes were detected, indicating no stable
complexes can be formed.
