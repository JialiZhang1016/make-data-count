Abstract
Introduction
In critically ill patients undergoing prolonged mechanical ventilation (MV), the difference in
long-term outcomes between patients with or without tracheostomy remains unexplored.
Methods
Ancillary study of a prospective international multicentre observational cohort in 21 centres
in France and Belgium, including 2087 patients, with a one-year follow-up after admission.
We included patients with a MV duration 10 days, with or without tracheostomy. We
explored the one-year mortality with a classical Cox regression model (adjustment on age,
SAPS II, baseline diagnosis and withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies) and a Cox regres-
sion model using tracheostomy as a time-dependant variable.
Results
29.5% patients underwent prolonged MV, out of which 25.6% received tracheostomy and
74.4% did not. At one-year, 45.2% patients had died in the tracheostomy group and 51.5%
patients had died in the group without tracheostomy (p = 0.001). In the Cox-adjusted regres-
sion model, tracheostomy was not associated with improved one-year outcome (HR CI95
0.7 [0.5–1.001], p = 0.051), as well as in the model using tracheostomy as a time-dependent
variable (OR CI 95 1 [0.7–1.4], p = 0.9).

Introduction
Prolonged weaning from mechanical ventilation (MV) in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is
associated with high mortality [1,2], and few strategies have been recently identified to
improve outcome in these patients. Tracheostomy has been proposed more than 20 years ago
to improve weaning and seems to be more frequently utilised in recent years [3]. However,
randomized-controlled trials, as well as observational studies [4], did not demonstrate better
long-term outcomes in patients receiving early (<day 7) as compared to late tracheostomy
(>day 14) [5,6]. The realization of tracheostomy is thus not currently recommended for the
weaning of mechanical ventilation [7].
The comparison between a tracheostomy versus a no-tracheostomy policy in patients
undergoing prolonged MV or weaning has been poorly explored [8]. Moreover, long-term
outcomes are less described and are probably of major interest, knowing the long-term mor-
bidity and mortality in these severe ICU patients [9]. We hypothesized that tracheostomy can
improve the outcomes of patients with prolonged MV. We elaborated an ancillary analysis of
the FROG-ICU study [10] in patients receiving prolonged MV duration with or without tra-
cheostomy and studied the one-year mortality in these two groups. We also studied the evolu-
tion of the quality of life during the follow-up.
Material and methods
This is an ancillary study of the FROG-ICU study (NCT01367093).[10] This study was
approved by ethics committee (Comite´ de la Protection des Personnes—Ile de France IV, IRB
n˚00003835 and Comission d’Ethique Biome´dicale Hospitalo-Facultaire de l’hoˆpital de Lou-
vain, IRB n˚B403201213353). Patients or next-of-kin provided written consent for participa-
tion in the study. The FROG-ICU is a multi-centre international observational study
performed in 21 ICUs (medical, surgical and mixed) in 14 university hospital in France and
Belgium, which included 2087 patients with a one-year follow-up after ICU admission. Briefly,
patients were included in case of invasive mechanical ventilation (MV)  24 hours and/or
treatment with vasoactive treatment (except for Dopamine). Non-inclusion criteria were a
Glasgow coma score  8, brain death or persistent vegetative state, pregnancy, transplantation
in the previous 12 months, moribund state and the lack of social security coverage.
Study population
In this ancillary study, we analysed patients with prolonged MV (10 days) [6,11]. Patients
with early tracheostomy were included as long as the overall duration of mechanical duration
was 10 days. Exclusion criteria were unknown duration of MV, tracheostomy upon ICU
admission, unknown timing of tracheostomy and patients without MV during ICU stay. The
threshold of 10 days was upheld because in an international multi-centric observational study

in patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) [11], patients with the most
severe pattern of ARDS underwent at least 9 days of MV and displayed higher mortality [6].
Primary outcome
The primary outcome was the one-year all-cause mortality in patients undergoing prolonged
MV (10 days) with or without tracheostomy.
Secondary outcome
The secondary outcome was the evolution of quality of life (Short-Form 36 (SF-36) survey),
symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (Impact of Event Scale–Revisited (IES-R) [12])
and symptoms of anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) [12]),
between patients with or without tracheostomy in the first year after ICU admission.
Data-collection
Clinical and biological data were recorded at admission and during the ICU stay: age, gender,
age-adjusted Charlson score, SAPS II, history of cardio-vascular and respiratory diseases,
cause of ICU admission, in-ICU complications (transfusion, renal replacement therapy, with-
drawal of life-sustaining therapies (WLST)), timing of tracheostomy, duration of MV, ICU
length of stay, oxygen at ICU discharge, facility after hospital discharge, outcomes. A follow-
up was performed during the first year after ICU admission, at 3, 6 and 12 months. Quality of
life evaluation was performed at 3,6 and 12 months with the SF-36, IES-R and HADS.
Statistical analysis
Continuous data are expressed as mean (±standard deviation) or median [quantile] and com-
pared with the Student t-test or Mann-Whitney test whenever appropriate. Nominal data are
expressed as N(%) and compared with the Chi2 or Fisher exact test whenever appropriate. The
primary outcome was the evolution of the one-year mortality in patients undergoing pro-
longed MV (10 days) with or without tracheostomy. Kaplan Meier curves for cumulative
mortality were elaborated during the one-year period. Comparison of survival were performed
with a Log-Rank test. Several models were elaborated. First, we performed a classical Cox
regression model adjusted on age, Simplified Acute Physiological Score II (SAPS II), diagnosis
on admission and withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies (WLST). Diagnosis on admission
were categorized: neurologic cause, respiratory failure, sepsis/septic shock and others. The
time zero of the Kaplan Meier curve was set at day-10 after admission (prolonged MV dura-
tion). Second, owing to the survival bias patients with mortality in the first weeks, might not
receive tracheostomy. We thus performed another Cox regression model, adjusted on age,
SAPS II, cause of ICU admission, WLST and transformed tracheostomy as a time-dependent
variable. Third, given the observational nature of the data, the treatment allocation (tracheos-
tomy) was not randomly assigned in the studied population. We used propensity-score match-
ing to reduce the risk of bias due to confounders and study more accurately the link between
tracheostomy and outcome [13]. Each patient treated with tracheostomy was matched to one
untreated control (prolonged MV) with a similar propensity score. Variables included in the
propensity score model were selected from the available baseline variables based on known
associations between factors and exposure (prolonged MV duration) (age, gender, neurologic
cause of admission, acute respiratory failure at admission, SAPS II, co-morbidities (age-
adjusted Charlson score), red blood pack transfusion, in-ICU renal replacement therapy and
in-ICU vasoactive treatment. Treated and not treated patients were matched according to the

nearest neighbour approach within a calliper width of 0.1. To assess the balance of covariates
between the two groups before and after propensity-score matching, mean standardized differ-
ences (MSD) were used. A mean standardized difference <10% was considered to support the
assumption of balance between groups [14]. In this matched sample, we performed a Cox
regression model adjusted on tracheostomy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders and
centre.
Because of the major impact of WLST on outcome, we performed a sensitivity analysis in
the sub-group of patients without WLST. In this subgroup of patients, Kaplan Meier curves for
cumulative mortality were elaborated during the one-year period. Outcome was compared
with a Log-Rank test, and a Cox regression model adjusted on age, SAPS II and diagnosis on
admission.
A 2-way ANOVA analysis was performed when analysing the evolution of SF-36, IES-R
and HADS over time and the differences between the two groups, with an interaction test. In
case the patient died during the follow-up, he/she was excluded from the quality of life analysis.
We did not impute a zero value to the quality of life data in this setting [15]. The Hazard Ratio
(HR) are presented with their 95% Confidence of Interval (CI).
Patients without a known duration of MV were not included in this study, and no multiple
imputation analysis were performed. All statistical tests were two-sided. A p value <0.05 was
considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed with R Studio version
1.0.136, with the Matching and Matchit packages (The “R” Foundation for Statistical Comput-
ing, Vienna, Austria).
Results
Out of the 2087 included in the FROG-study, 1024 (49%) patients had a duration of MV shorter
than 10 days, 93 (4.4%) patients had early tracheostomy and 346 (16.6%) presented exclusion
criteria. We thus analysed 157 (25.6%) patients with tracheostomy (10 days) and 458 (74.4%)
without (Fig 1). Tracheostomy was performed with a median timing of 20 [16–27] days.
Study population
Full demographic data are displayed in Table 1. Patients with tracheostomy were younger than
patients with prolonged MV (59 (±15) years vs. 63 (±16) years, p = 0.005), had lower SAPS II
score (52 (±20) vs 47 (±21), p = 0.005) and less co-morbidities assessed with the Charlson
score (3 [1–4] vs. 3 [1–5], p = 0.04). There were no significant differences in baseline causes of
admission with patients without tracheostomy (p = 0.06). During their ICU stay, patients
receiving tracheostomy had less WLST (13 (8.2%) vs. 84 (18.3%), p = 0.001). The median tim-
ing of WLST was 18 [12–27] days. In patients with tracheostomy, the median timing of WLST
was 44 [29–48] days. In the no-tracheostomy group, the median timing of WLST was 16 [11–
23] days.
Primary outcome
One-year after ICU admission, 71 (45.2%) patients had died in the tracheostomy group and
236 (51.5%) in the no-tracheostomy group (p = 0.001, log-rank test) (Fig 2, Panel A). In the
Cox-adjusted regression model, adjusted on age, baseline cause of admission, SAPS II score
and WLST, there was no significant difference between tracheostomy and no- tracheostomy
on the one-year mortality (HR CI95 0.7 [0.5–1.001], p = 0.051) (Table 2).
We matched 150 patients in each group with a propensity score (S1 Table). In this matched
sample, there was an association between improved outcome in the group with tracheostomy
compared to patients with no- tracheostomy (HR CI95 0.6 [0.5–0.9], p = 0.02) (Fig 2, Panel B).

The Cox regression model, using tracheostomy as a time-dependent variable, showed no
significant association between the one-year outcome and the use of tracheostomy (OR CI 95
1 [0.7–1.4], p = 0.9). In a sensitivity analysis, we excluded patients who underwent WLST in
the ICU. There was no significant difference between patients with or without tracheostomy
on the one-year mortality regarding the Log-Rank test (p = 0.08) and the Cox regression
model (HR CI95 0.74 [0.5–1.09], p = 0.1)(S1 Fig).
Secondary outcome
We compared the evolution of the quality of life during the one-year follow-up in survivors
with tracheostomy or without tracheostomy. At 3 months, we gathered quality of life question-
naires in 44 (12.8%) patients who underwent tracheostomy and in 53 (28%) patients without
tracheostomy. At one-year, we gathered data in 38 (24.2%) patients who underwent tracheos-
tomy and in 48 (11.5%) patients without. Regarding quality of life assessment, there were no
differences between the mental and physical components of the SF-26 between the two groups,
during the first year of follow-up (Fig 3, S2 Table). Regarding anxiety/depression symptoms
and post-traumatic stress disorders, there were no differences between the groups regarding
the HADS and IES-R scales respectfully (S2 Table).
Discussion
Our study shows that in ICU patients undergoing prolonged MV, tracheostomy is not associ-
ated with an improved one-year outcome. In patients with prolonged MV and weaning [1],
few recent therapeutic progresses have been made. In a recent international observational
study of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) patients [16], a duration of MV > 9
days was observed in patients with the most severe ARDS pattern and these patients displayed
a higher mortality rate than patients with mild-to-moderate ARDS. As previously described
[3,6], we have thus selected 10 days as the cut-off for the definition of prolonged MV.
In a recent meta-analysis pooling 11 studies [17]studying the association between early and
late tracheostomy on patients’ outcomes, the authors found a decrease in the ICU length of
stay and in the duration of sedation, in the early tracheostomy group. However, there was no

difference in the in-hospital mortality. In another meta-analysis [18], there was no statistically
significant difference regarding the one-year mortality in patients receiving early tracheos-
tomy, but only 3 studies assessed this outcome.
Several differences must be underlined with the current work. First, early tracheostomies
with low duration of MV were not included in our analysis and we focused in patients under-
going protracted MV with or without tracheostomy. This strategy has been poorly explored in
the current literature and moreover, we herein display long-term outcomes, which has been
rarely document in this topic. In spite of negative results, we bring new light on the effects of
tracheostomy in patients with prolonged MV.
There was no difference in the quality of life assessed by the SF-36 between the 2 groups
during the one-year follow-up. However, these results should be cautiously interpreted, since
there is a selection bias since only 34.6% of the patients included in this sub-study provided
quality of life questionnaires during the follow-up. During post-critical care illness follow-up,
a high number of patients are unfortunately lost in the process. In a monocentric study [19]
evaluating the self-reported quality of life, 60% of patients could performed a complete follow-
up. In another 2-year follow-up performed in a critical care pediatric population [20], around
55% of children underwent complete neuropsychological assessment. This underlines the
complexity of performing exhaustive follow-up after critical care illness. In spite of an excellent
follow-up regarding the primary outcome in our study, there quality of life assessment in the
first year after ICU admission remains disappointing, and implies a selection bias. Therefore,
it is very difficult to assess the impact of tracheostomy on the quality of life in survivors with
prolonged MV duration.
There is a statistically significant imbalance in WLST between both groups, which is of
major importance regarding outcome. When excluding these patients, our sensitivity analysis
showed the same trend of the relative effect of tracheostomy on outcome. This sensitivity anal-
ysis displays a loss of power, which could explain, at least in part, why these results are not sta-
tistically significant. Moreover, WLST were performed after the realisation of tracheostomy
and are probably not a confounding factor of the effects of tracheostomy.
Our study has limitations. First, this is an observational study and therefore our result can-
not reflect causation between tracheostomy and outcomes. Also, the reason of tracheostomy
was not recorded, which implies a selection bias. There was a significant imbalance between
the 2 groups regarding WLST. This point hampers solid conclusions regarding the long-term
effects of tracheostomy in severe critically ill patients. Second, we have missing data regarding

the duration of MV and we did not perform multiple imputation analysis. The quality of life
questionnaires were retrieved by postmail during follow-up. This explains the missing values
and also implies selection bias. Our proportion of patients receiving prolonged MV could
seem high compared to others [1], but the differences in inclusion criteria as well as the defini-
tion of prolonged weaning could explain these discrepancies. Finally, the divergent results

ranges from 0 (poor quality of life) to 100 (upper quality of life). There is no significant difference in the MCS (Left

between the Cox regression model and the propensity-score analysis could be explained by the
difference in the number of variables considered for adjustment and propensity matching.
However, taking into account the survival bias, the Cox regression model using tracheostomy
as a time-dependent variable, did not display significance.
Conclusion
In this international multi-centre observational study, tracheostomy was not associated with
improved one-year mortality in ICU patients receiving prolonged MV (10 days). Methodo-
logical issues such as selection bias, renders the results difficult to generalize. Randomized-
Controlled Trials are needed before drawing definitive conclusions, but interventional studies
in ICU patients with prolonged MV remain challenging [8].

no significant difference between patients with or without tracheostomy. Log-Rank test,
p = 0.08. Cox regression model adjusted on age, SAPS II and diagnosis upon admission: HR
CI95 0.74 [0.5–1.09], p = 0.1.

S2 Table. Long-term quality of life in patients with or without tracheostomy. During the
first year of follow-up, there was no statistically significant difference regarding the Mental
and Physical components of the SF-36 between both groups (p = 0.9 and 0.9 respectively).
There is no statistically significant difference in IES-R, Anxiety symptoms (HADS scale) or
Depression symptoms (HADS scale) between the 2 groups (respectively p = 0.9, 0.2, 0.5), or
evolution over time (respectively p = 0.1, p = 0.4, p = 0.3). Two-way ANOVA.
