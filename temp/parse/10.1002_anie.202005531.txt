Abstract: Trifluoromethyl sulfoxides are a new class of
trifluoromethylthiolating reagent. The sulfoxides engage in
metal-free CH trifluoromethylthiolation with a range of
(hetero)arenes. The method is also applicable to the function-
alization of important compound classes, such as ligand
derivatives and polyaromatics, and in the late-stage trifluor-
omethylthiolation of medicines and agrochemicals. The iso-
lation and characterization of a sulfonium salt intermediate
supports an interrupted Pummerer reaction mechanism.
Incorporating fluorine into organic compounds is a useful
tool in drug design and development. The fluoro group is well
known to improve the pharmacokinetic properties of a mol-
ecule and fluorine-18 is an important radioisotope in molec-
ular imaging.[1,2] Trifluoromethylthio (SCF3) groups are
commonly found in drug molecules and veterinary medi-
cines.[3,4] By combining a fluorinated moiety with a hetero-
atom, many have turned to the SCF3 group to impart useful
properties, such as high lipophilicity, to a compound of
interest.[5]
An attractive route for incorporating SCF3 groups into
organic molecules is through the direct, metal-free function-
alization of CH bonds.[6] Early methods using trifluorome-
thylsulfenyl chloride have fallen from favor because of
concerns over handling and toxicity of the reagent.[7] This
triggered a push to develop shelf-stable, easy-to-handle
trifluoromethylthiolating agents (Scheme 1A).[8] Despite the
advantages of these reagents, they are generally limited to the
CH
trifluoromethylthiolation
of
highly
electron-rich
(hetero)arenes, such as indoles and phenols, whereas reac-
tions involving less nucleophilic arenes, such as anisole and
toluene, are scarce.[8d,o,p,a,b] Furthermore, few reports describe
the use of these reagents for the late-stage trifluoromethylth-
iolation of complex molecules.[8j,m,n,a,b]
In recent years, our group[9] and others[10] have explored
the so-called interrupted Pummerer reaction of sulfoxides
and its use for the functionalization of CH bonds.[11] For
example, we have described the thioarylation of simple arenes
using sulfoxides as sulfide precursors.[9c] Key to these reac-
tions is the in situ formation of a highly electrophilic
sulfonium salt, by activation of the sulfoxide with an acid
anhydride, which is susceptible to reaction with a range of
nucleophiles.
We were keen to assess whether underutilized trifluor-
omethyl sulfoxides would engage in CH trifluoromethylth-
iolation. We reasoned that trifluoromethylsulfonium salts,
generated from trifluoromethyl sulfoxides by an interrupted
Pummerer reaction, would prove versatile intermediates en
route to the incorporation of SCF3 into nucleophilic arenes.
Herein, we present trifluoromethyl sulfoxides as novel,
tuneable trifluoromethylthiolating agents (Scheme 1B). The
easy to prepare, bench-stable and novel trifluoromethyl
sulfoxides[12] allow SCF3 incorporation into a variety of
heteroarenes and arenes, including drug molecules, at the
expense of CH bonds. In contrast to current methods for
trifluoromethylthiolation, which involve direct attack of an
arene on an electrophilic SCF3 reagent, our unique strategy
builds the desired connectivity to give sulfonium salts that are

selectively deconstructed in situ to deliver trifluoromethylth-
iolated products.
Our first aim was to design and synthesize a sulfoxide
suitable for general and selective trifluoromethylthiolation.[13]
Key to our mechanistic hypothesis for trifluoromethylthiola-
tion is the selective loss of the R group, rather than the CF3
group, from the sulfoxide 1 (Scheme 1B). As this step likely
occurs by nucleophilic substitution in a sulfonium salt
intermediate (see below), we identified the benzyl-substituted
trifluoromethyl sulfoxide 1a as a candidate for enabling
trifluoromethylthiolation: the activating effect of the adjacent
p-system, combined with the inhibitory effect of fluoro groups
towards incoming nucleophiles,[14] would make the benzyl
group more susceptible to removal. We developed a new
route for the synthesis of 1a, which was obtained as a free-
flowing, bench-stable, crystalline solid and has been charac-
terized by X-ray crystallographic analysis (Scheme 1B).[15]
With a novel sulfoxide in hand, we attempted the
trifluoromethylthiolation of indole (2a; Scheme 2). The
sulfoxide was activated using triflic anhydride[9] to give the
desired trifluoromethylthiolated indole 3a in 70% yield. The
reaction tolerated substitution at all positions around the
indole motif [C4 (3b, 3 f, 3h), C5 (3d, 3e, 3i), C6 (3c, 3g), C7
(3j) and C3 (3k)], including various electron-withdrawing
(3b–g) and electron-donating (3i–k) groups. We were pleased
to find that functional groups that can undergo subsequent
transformations, such as halides (3b, 3c), nitriles (3d), esters
(3e–3g), and boronate esters (3h), were well tolerated. N-
methyl indoles also worked well in the procedure (3l–n). A
range of other heteroaromatic compounds also underwent
efficient CH trifluoromethylthiolation, such as benzothio-
phene (3o), thiophenes (3p, 3q), benzofuran (3r) and
pyrroles (3s, 3t). The reaction was also executed on a gram
scale without severe detriment to the yield (3a).
In comparison to heteroarenes, the trifluoromethylthio-
lation of arenes has received less attention.[8d,o,p,a,b] Initial
results using 1a gave poor yields of the desired trifluorome-
thylthiolated arenes, however, a novel ester-derived trifluor-
omethyl sulfoxide, 1b, showed good reactivity (Scheme 3).
This outcome suggests that the structure of the sulfoxide can
be tuned for optimization with a specific class of substrate.[16]
With 1b, anisole, phenol and other alkylated arenes were
responsive to trifluoromethylthiolation (5a–e).[17] Unfortu-
nately, free amines were not tolerated in this reaction (5 f).[18]
A range of 1,2- (5g–j) 1,3- (5k) and 1,4-disubstituted (5l, 5m)
arenes, bearing various functionalities, such as halogens and
esters, also performed well under our reaction conditions. The
reaction was also applicable to trisubstituted arenes (5n, 5o)
and naphthalenes (5p, 5q). Finally, we showcased our method
using substrates relevant in catalysis, materials, medicine, and
agriculture. We were able to trifluoromethylthiolate a BINOL
derivative (5r), pyrene (5s), drugs (5t), pesticides (5u), and
a natural product derivative (5v).
A mechanistic proposal for the trifluoromethylthiolation
is summarized in Scheme 4. The trifluoromethyl sulfoxides
1 are initially activated through reaction with Tf2O to produce
the electrophilic intermediates 6. The intermediates 6 then
undergo the so-called interrupted Pummerer reaction with
a (hetero)arene (e.g. 4) to give the sulfonium salts 7. Selective
removal of the R group by Et2NH reveals the trifluorome-
thylthiolated products (e.g. 5). Experimental and computa-
tional studies provided support for our proposed mechanism.
Firstly, the sulfonium salt 7m was isolated from the reaction
between p-xylene (4m) and 1b.[15,19] We then modelled the
dealkylation step using DFT calculations. These results
showed that the transition state for attack of the amine
(Et2NH) at the -CH2CO2Et group lies 40.8 kJmol1 lower in
energy than the transition state for attack at the -CF3 group.
In addition, the expected side-product, Et2NCH2CO2Et (8),
was detected by GCMS. It is likely that attack at the -CF3
group is disfavored because of unfavorable electrostatic
interactions,[14] though further studies are required to fully
delineate the intricacies of this mechanism. These studies
highlight our unique strategy for trifluoromethylthiolation;
whereas current methods proceed through direct attack of an
arene on an electrophilic SCF3 reagent,[8] we have introduced
alternative reactivity in which the desired connectivity is built,
to give 7, before inducing controlled deconstruction and
release of the desired trifluoromethylthiolated products.

In summary, we have developed a new strategy for the
metal-free CH trifluoromethylthiolation of (hetero)arenes.
In this process, we utilize the interrupted Pummerer reaction
to establish trifluoromethyl sulfoxides as novel trifluorome-
thylthiolating agents. Our method for incorporating SCF3
components exploits a build-up/deconstruct strategy and is
mechanistically distinct from current processes. A variety of
(hetero)aromatic compounds underwent efficient trifluoro-
methylthiolation, including drug molecules and natural prod-
ucts. We expect trifluoromethyl sulfoxides to find application
in other trifluoromethylthiolation reactions in the future.

When reacting the indole 2l with 1b, product 3l was formed in
17% yield. When reacting the arene 4m with 1a, product 5m
was formed in 7% yield. This suggests that less nucleophilic
arenes (4) require the presumably more electrophilic sulfoxide
