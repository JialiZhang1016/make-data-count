Eggs were laid singly on the under surface of the fronds of its host plant,  Selaginella   sp. (  Bryophyta  :  Selaginellaceae  ). Larvae are solitary in all instars, presenting a color pattern and shape that make them cryptic on its host plant. The pupa is short, smooth and varies from rusty brown to green. Despite the lack of a close phylogenetic relationship, larvae of  Euptychia   are very similar to those of the paleotropical satyrines  Ragadia   and  Acrophtalmia   , suggesting that camouflage is likely to be one of the factors explaining the similarities among them.

As a result, the systematics of the subtribe has been revised from the species to the subtribal level, with significant reorganization in most of the large genera (see references above). Nevertheless, some important points remain under discussion, including the monophyly of the subtribe in relation to its nominal genus  Euptychia   Hübner, 1818 (  Peña et al. 2010 ,  Marín et al. 2017 ,  Espeland et al. 2019 ). 

 As for other large genera of Euptychiina  ,  Euptychia   has also been the target of several studies in recent years, and since the checklist of Lamas (2014), the number of recognized species in the genus has increased from 13 to 34 (  Freitas et al. 2012 ,  Neild et al. 2014 ,  2015 ,  Nakahara et al. 2014 ,  2015a ,  c ,  d ,  2016 ,  Fratello et al. 2015 ,  Warren et al. 2018 , see also  Freitas et al. 2013 and  Nakahara et al. 2015b ), with at least 15 additional species awaiting to be described (S. Nakahara, unpublished data). Species of  Euptychia   are present in most Neotropical forests, although they are more common in lowland and submontane forests, where they can be locally common (AVLF personal observation). Despite their prevalence in some habitats, very little is known about their ecology, behavior and natural history. For example,  Euptychia   is well-known for being one of the few butterflies to use  Lycopsida  as larval host plants (  Singer et al. 1971 ,  Singer and Mallet 1986 ,  DeVries 1987 ). However, although there are some images of immature stages available for  Euptychia  westwoodi   A. Butler, 1867 (  Hamm and Fordyce 2016 ,  Janzen and Hallwachs 2018 ) and partial descriptions for four additional Costa Rican species (  Singer et al. 1983 ,  DeVries 1987 ), a detailed, complete description of the immature stages for any species of  Euptychia   is still lacking. 

 In the present paper, descriptions of the immature stages for Euptychia  mollina   (Hübner, [1813]) are presented. This is the first paper illustrating in detail all life stages for a species of  Euptychia   and also the first report on immature stages from a species outside of Costa Rica. 

  Material and methods  A single egg was obtained through the observation of an oviposition event in the rural region of Belterra municipality, Pará State, Northern Brazil, on August 19, 2018 ( 2°35'47"S; 54°57'00"W  ). The oviposited plant was an unidentified  Selaginella   (  Lycopsida  :  Selaginellaceae  ) that was brought to the laboratory and potted to be used to feed the larva. The egg was brought to laboratory and, after hatching, the larva was reared in a plastic container cleaned daily and provided with fresh plant material (see above) every two or three days (following  Freitas 2007 ). Data were recorded on morphology and development time for all stages. Dry head capsules and the pupal case were retained in glass vials. Voucher specimens of the immature stages and adults (the ovipositing female and the emerged adult) were deposited in the Museu de Zoologia “Adão José Cardoso” (ZUEC-AVLF), Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil. Additional material was obtained from the Teles Pires River, Alta Floresta municipality, northern Mato Grosso State, Central Brazil, on June 20, 2000 (  9°38'12"S; 55°56'24"W  ). Several eggs and larvae were also collected in the field on fronds of  Selaginella   sp. along a forest edge following a dirt road running parallel to the river. 

 Measurements were taken and general aspects of morphology were observed using a Leica ® MZ7.5 stereomicroscope equipped with a micrometric scale. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was conducted using a JEOL  ® JSM-5800 microscope, and samples were prepared in accordance with the following protocol: Sample critical point dried using Bal-tec  ® – CPD030 equipment and attached with double stick tape to aluminum stubs; gold/palladium coated with a Bal-tec  ® – SCD050 sputter coater. Egg size is presented as height and diameter, and head capsule size is the distance between the most external stemmata (as in  Freitas 2007 ). Terminology for early stages descriptions follows  García-Barros and Martín (1995) for eggs and  Stehr (1987) for larvae and pupae. 

  Results  The morphological description and measurements of the immature stages below are based on material from Belterra, Pará. Additional data from Teles Pires river, Alta Floresta, Mato Grosso, are included at the end of this section.

 Behavior and natural history. Euptychia  mollina   (Fig.  16 ) is very common all year round in several habitats where its host plant  Selaginella   sp. occurs (Fig.  23 ), including forest gaps, sand forests with open canopy, secondary vegetation and forest edges (Figs  21–23 ). In some of these places,  E.  mollina   can be locally abundant, such as in Alta Floresta, where dozens of individuals were observed flying in a 200 m transect. The eggs were placed singly on the under surface of the fronds of its host plant (  Selaginella   sp., see above). The larvae are solitary in all instars, and its color pattern and shape make it cryptic on fronds of  Selaginella   sp. Two  Braconidae  parasitoids (  Hymenoptera  ) were obtained from two field-collected larvae from Mato Grosso in 2000. Adults have a low flight near the ground, rarely flying above 2 m. Males were not observed exhibiting territorial behavior.

  https://binary.pensoft.net/fig/307144     Discussion  As previously mentioned, Euptychia   species are well-known for using non-monocots as larval host plants, mainly  Selaginella   , but also  Neckeropsis   mosses (  Bryophyta  :  Neckeraceae  ) (  Singer et al. 1971 ,  Singer and Mallet 1986 ,  DeVries 1987 ). The use of  Lycopsida  as host plants is known in only two other butterfly genera, coincidently also in the tribe  Satyrini  , namely  Ragadia   Westwood, [1851] and  Acrophtalmia   C. and R. Felder, 1861 (  Fukuda 1983 ,  Igarashi and Fukuda 1996 ). Curiously, both  Ragadia   and  Acrophtalmia   are Paleotropical genera not related to each other (as previously suggested by  Miller 1968 and  Fukuda 1983 ) or to the Neotropical  Euptychia   (  Wahlberg et al. 2009 ,  Espeland et al. 2019 ), suggesting that the use of  Selaginella   as hostplants is a result of independent host shifts, as proposed for insects in general (  Mound et al. 1994 ). 

 Nevertheless, despite the lack of a close phylogenetic relationship among Euptychia   ,  Ragadia   and  Acrophtalmia   , larvae in these three genera are surprisingly similar in shape and color pattern (  Igarashi and Fukuda 1996 and this paper), although diverging in several other morphological characters. For example, while larvae of all known species of  Euptychia   present a pair of head scoli, larvae of both  Ragadia   and  Acrophtalmia   lack conspicuous head scoli (  Igarashi and Fukuda 1996 ). The pupal shape is also quite distinct, with  Ragadia   and  Acrophtalmia   presenting pupae that are much more rounded and globose than those of  Euptychia   (  Igarashi and Fukuda 1996 ). Given this scenario, independent evolution of camouflage explains the similar appearance of the caterpillars in all these cases, as previously suggested (  Singer and Mallet 1986 ,  DeVries 1987 ,  Igarashi and Fukuda 1996 ), which results in a color pattern convergence among larvae that feed on  Selaginella   . Moreover, larvae of  Orsotriaena   Wallengren, 1858 and  Zipaetis   Hewitson, 1863, two genera phylogenetically close to  Ragadia   (  Wahlberg et al. 2009 , M. Espeland et al. unpublished data), feed on monocots and are quite distinct from  Ragadia   larvae (  Sourakov and Emmel 2001 ,  Kalesh and Valappil 2018 ,  Saji and Kunte 2018 ). 

 As additional detailed descriptions of immature stages of Satyrini  come to light, coupled with natural history observations, it becomes clear that camouflage is possibly one of the major strategies of larvae in this group to escape from predators (e.g.  DeVries 1987 ,  Freitas 2002 ,  2017 ,  Freitas et al. 2016 ).
