Abstract
1. Temporal fluctuations in growth rates can arise from both variation in age‐specific 
vital rates and temporal fluctuations in age structure (i.e. the relative abundance 
of individuals in each age‐class). However, empirical assessments of temporal 
fluctuations in age structure and their effects on population growth rate are rela-
tively rare. Most research has focused on understanding the contribution of chang-
ing vital rates to population growth rates and these analyses routinely assume that: 
(a) populations have stable age distributions, (b) environmental influences on vital 
rates and age structure are stationary (i.e. the mean and/or variance of these pro-
cesses does not change over time), and (c) dynamics are independent of density.
2. Here we quantified fluctuations in age structure and assessed whether they were 
stationary for four populations of free‐ranging vertebrates: moose (observed for 
48 years), elk (15 years), tawny owls (15 years) and grey wolves (17 years). We also 
assessed the extent that fluctuations in age structure were useful for predicting an-
nual population growth rates using models which account for density dependence.
3. Fluctuations in age structure were of a similar magnitude to fluctuations in abun-
dance. For three populations (moose, elk, owls), the mean and the skew of the age 
distribution fluctuated without stabilizing over the observed time periods. More 
precisely, the sample variance (interannual variance) of age structure indices in-
creased with the length of the study period, which suggests that fluctuations in 
age structure were non‐stationary for these populations – at least over the 15‐ to 
48‐year periods analysed.
4. Fluctuations in age structure were associated with population growth rate for two 
populations. In particular, population growth varied from positive to negative for 
moose and from near zero to negative for elk as the average age of adults in-
creased over its observed range.
5. Non‐stationarity in age structure may represent an important mechanism by 
which abundance becomes non‐stationary – and therefore difficult to forecast 
– over time‐scales of concern to wildlife managers. Overall, our results empha-
size the need for vertebrate populations to be modelled using approaches that 
consider transient dynamics and density dependence and that do not rely on the 
assumption that environmental processes are stationary.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Much empirical research on age‐ or stage‐structured populations 
has focused on understanding which age‐ or stage‐specific vital 
rates have the greatest influence on fluctuations in population 
growth (Ezard, Becker, & Coulson, 2006; Gaillard & Yoccoz, 2003). 
A common technique to assess fluctuations in population growth is 
perturbation analyses, which account for both temporal fluctuations 
of age‐specific vital rates and elasticities – a relative measure of how 
changes in a vital rate affect population growth (Caswell, 2000). In 
these analyses, growth rate (defined as the asymptotic λ) for year 
t is expressed as a function of a transition matrix (At) representing 
the age‐specific vital rates, and a column vector (Nt) representing 
abundances for each age‐class. More specifically, Nt+1 = At(Nt) and 
λt = nt+1/nt, where nt is total abundance. However, because the rel-
ative abundances of individuals in each age‐class may also vary 
across time, Nt+1 may be expressed as At(Stnt), where St represents 
the population’s standing age structure or the relative abundance 
of individuals in each age‐class. These simple expressions lead to a 
long known result: For a given At and nt, λt also depends on St. In 
other words, temporal fluctuations in growth rate may arise from 
both fluctuations in At (due perhaps to density dependence or en-
vironmental stochasticity) as well as the resulting fluctuations in St. 
A population’s age structure, St, may fluctuate considerably in re-
sponse to environmental stressors, such as severe weather, preda-
tion and intraspecific competition, because those processes tend to 
have less adverse impacts on prime‐aged individuals, compared to 
juveniles and senescent adults (Coulson et al., 2001; Hoy et al., 2015; 
Wright, Peterson, Smith, & Lemke, 2006). However, until recently, 
most analyses assessing population growth for vertebrate species 
assumed that populations are fixed at a stable age distribution (but 
see Gamelon et al., 2016; Haridas, Tuljapurkar, & Coulson, 2009).
When the age structure of a population deviates from the hypo-
thetical stable age distribution, perturbation analyses – which are 
routinely used to inform management decisions – may not reliably 
indicate which vital rates contribute the most to temporal varia-
tion in population growth (Koons, Grand, Zinner, & Rockwell, 2005; 
Yearsley, 2004). However, relatively little is known about the extent 
to which the age structure of populations fluctuates under natural 
conditions, particularly for terrestrial vertebrates, because it is often 
logistically infeasible to collect the data needed to estimate age 
structure for free‐ranging populations (but see Coulson, Gaillard, & 
Festa‐Bianchet, 2005; Coulson, Guinness, Pemberton, & Clutton‐
Brock, 2004; Gerber & Kendall, 2016; Margalida, Oro, Cortés‐
Avizanda, Heredia, & Donázar, 2011; Payo‐Payo et al., 2018; Regehr, 
Amstrup, & Stirling, 2006). Furthermore, direct empirical assess-
ments of the influence of fluctuations in age structure on population 
growth rate are rare (but see Coulson et al., 2005; Koons et al., 2005; 
Koons, Iles, Schaub, Caswell, & Hodgson, 2016). Consequently, there 
is value in empirically assessing temporal fluctuations in St and the 
extent to which such fluctuations explain temporal fluctuations in 
population growth rates.
In recent years, there has been increasing interest in developing 
stochastic models of growth rate that account for both fluctuations 
in vital rates and age structure (Caswell, 2010; Davison et al., 2010; 
Ezard et al., 2010; Koons et al., 2016). Nevertheless, these models 
have typically made two important assumptions. The first assump-
tion is that growth is independent of density (Stott, Townley, & 
Hodgson, 2011); however, density dependence is a ubiquitous phe-
nomenon in the dynamics of free‐ranging populations (Bonenfant 
et al., 2009). The second assumption is that environments are sta-
tionary (Haridas et al., 2009), meaning that the mean and variance 
of environmental processes remains constant over time. Although 
non‐stationarity and autocorrelation are not entirely independent 
ideas, they are distinct, insomuch as autocorrelation measures the 
similarity between two observations as a function of the time‐lag, 
whereas non‐stationarity indicates that properties of the time se-
ries, such as the mean and/or variance, change over time. Many spe-
cies are exposed to non‐stationary environments over ecologically 
relevant time frames (Vasseur & Yodzis, 2004). Some examples of 
processes that can result in environments being non‐stationary are 
anthropogenic changes in climate and landscape use (Wolkovich, 
Cook, McLauchlan, & Davies, 2014).
Non‐stationary environments may result in non‐stationary age 
structure dynamics (Hastings, 2004; Koons et al., 2016; Wolkovich 
et al., 2014). For example, several consecutive years of stressful 
environmental conditions may result in low recruitment for sev-
eral years running, which in turn would lead to an increase in the 
proportion of older individuals in the population. Such shifts in age 
structure are likely to affect future dynamics, especially for mam-
mal and bird populations, because older individuals tend to have 
lower reproductive rates (Nussey, Froy, Lemaitre, Gaillard, & Austad, 
2013) and their survival rates are more sensitive to environmental 
stress compared to prime‐aged individuals. Therefore, the influ-
ence of non‐stationary environments on age structure and its sub-
sequent influence on growth rates may occur with some time‐lag. 
Nevertheless, the extent to which populations exhibit non‐station-
ary age structure dynamics remains largely unknown, particularly 
for terrestrial vertebrates. Yet, non‐stationarity has important impli-
cations for understanding population dynamics (Kaitala, Ylikarjula, 
Ranta, & Lundberg, 1997; Ranta, Lundberg, Kaitala, & Laakso, 2000; 
Royle, Lindström, & Metcalfe, 2005). In particular, non‐stationary 
processes are difficult to predict because past dynamics are a poor 
indicator of future dynamics (Poole, 1978).

Here, we quantify temporal fluctuations in age structure and 
assess whether age structure dynamics showed signs of being 
non‐stationary for four terrestrial vertebrate populations, which 
have all been the focus of long‐term research: grey wolves (Canis 
lupus) in Yellowstone National Park (USA), tawny owls (Strix aluco) 
in Kielder Forest (England), moose (Alces alces) in Isle Royale 
National Park (USA) and elk (Cervus elaphus) wintering along the 
northern border of Yellowstone National Park. We also assess the 
relationship between age structure and population growth using 
models which account for the potentially confounding influence of 
density dependence.
2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 | Study populations
All four study species are iteroparous, with vital rates that change 
substantially with age (see Appendix S1; Figures S1 and S2). The 
grey wolf population within Yellowstone National Park, USA (44°N, 
110°W), has been monitored since the population was reintroduced 
in 1995 (Smith, Drummer, Murphy, Guernsey, & Evans, 2004). Tawny 
owls have been monitored in a 70‐km2 subsection of Kielder Forest, 
England (55°13′N, 2°33′W) since 1979 (Petty, 1992b). The moose 
population in Isle Royale National Park (47°N, 88°W) has been stud-
ied continuously since 1958 (Vucetich & Peterson, 2004). The elk 
population, which winters along Yellowstone National Park’s north-
ern border and adjacent areas of Montana, has been monitored 
since the 1930s (Houston, 1982) and studied intensively since 1995 
(White, Proffitt, & Lemke, 2012).
Wolves and elk are not hunted within Yellowstone National Park, 
but both species are subject to human‐caused mortality when indi-
viduals leave the park, which occurs often enough to be a significant 
source of mortality. By contrast, the tawny owl and moose popula-
tions are not harvested. Wolves live in kin‐structured social groups 
called packs, which aggressively defend their territories. Packs are 
typically comprised of one breeding pair and other subordinate non‐
breeding members (Mech & Boitani, 2003). Tawny owls are also ter-
ritorial; however, territories are occupied by a single breeding pair, 
which defend their territory throughout the year (Petty, 1992b). 
Population dynamics are thought to be strongly density‐dependent 
in the territorial wolf and owl populations. By contrast, moose and 
elk are not territorial. The moose population is limited by predation 
and climate (Vucetich & Peterson, 2004), whereas the elk population 
was strongly limited by human harvest in the past, but is increas-
ingly impacted by predation (MacNulty, Stahler, Wyman, Ruprecht, 
& Smith, 2016).
2.2 | Estimating age structure
Due to differences in the type of data available for each population, 
we used two different methods for generating annual estimates of 
age structure (i.e. the number of juveniles, 1‐, 2‐ and 3‐year‐olds that 
were present in each population, for every year of the study period). 
For the wolf and tawny owl populations, we used re‐sighting data 
of marked individuals to obtain annual estimates of age structure. 
For the moose and elk populations, we used reconstruction analysis 
based on dead‐recovery data (similar to Fryxell et al., 1999; Gove, 
Skalski, Zager, & Townsend, 2002; Solberg, Sæther, Strand, & Loison, 
1999).
2.2.1 | Grey wolves
The identity and age of a large proportion of wolves in the 
Yellowstone population were known because 30% to 50% of pups 
(surviving to 9 months of age) have been radiocollared every year 
since wolves were reintroduced in Yellowstone in 1995 (MacNulty 
et al., 2009). These radiocollared individuals were tracked and ob-
served on a daily‐to‐weekly basis throughout the year (Cassidy, 
MacNulty, Stahler, Smith, & Mech, 2015). We used this re‐sighting 
data to estimate age structure each year over a 17‐year period that 
began after reintroduction activities were completed, 1998–2014.
2.2.2 | Tawny owls
We used re‐sighting data of owls, uniquely marked with metal rings, 
to estimate age structure for a 15‐year period, 1990–1998 and 
2008–2013. The gap in that time series is due to not having re‐cap-
ture data for breeding males for the period, 1999–2007. Otherwise, 
more than 90% of the population was marked during the study pe-
riod (Millon, Petty, Little, & Lambin, 2011; Petty, 1992b). The exact 
age of many individuals is known because they were first captured 
as chicks within our study site or in other sites nearby. The age of 
an additional 82 unmarked adults entering the population as immi-
grants of unknown origin could be reliably estimated from moulting 
patterns of primary feathers (Petty, 1992a).
2.2.3 | Moose and elk
The reconstruction analysis approach for estimating age structure 
uses dead‐recovery data and involves the following steps: (a) creat-
ing a database of year‐of‐death and age‐at‐death for individuals in 
each population, (b) using this database to create a cohort matrix 
and (c) using the cohort matrix to calculate the minimum number 
of individuals alive in each age‐class, every year. Each year we lo-
cated the carcasses of moose and elk, which died within the past 
year during aerial and ground surveys in Isle Royale National Park 
(from 1959 onwards) and Yellowstone National Park (from 1995 
onwards). We determined age‐at‐death for each individual moose 
and elk by counting cementum lines of teeth (Haagenrud, 1978; 
Peterson, 1977; Rolandsen et al., 2008). In total, we were able to de-
termine age‐at‐death and year‐of‐birth for 2,779 moose dying during 
a known year, between 1959 and 2015. We were also able to deter-
mine age‐at‐death and year‐of‐birth for 3,078 elk dying of natural 
causes between 1995 and 2015 and for 10,133 elk killed by hunters 
between 1996 and 2009. Although young elk (<2 years old) were 
under‐represented in the hunter‐killed elk dataset, such age‐specific

vulnerability to hunting is not a concern for our analyses because it 
is only likely to bias estimates of age structure in very recent years 
and we did not analyse elk age structure after 2009 (see below for 
details). There is no harvest data available for the Isle Royale moose 
population because it is not hunted.
We organized the dead‐recovery data into a cohort matrix, C. 
Sample size was large enough to allow for calculating sex‐specific co-
hort matrices for the elk population, but not the moose population. 
The rows in C represent cohorts (i.e. individuals born in the same 
year), whereas the columns indicate the age‐at‐death, such that ele-
ment Ct,j represents the number of individuals born in year t that died 
at j years of age. For example, C1999,4 = 5 indicates that we recovered 
the carcasses of five individuals that were born in 1999, and died at 
four years of age in 2003 (=1999 + 4). Because the C matrix is derived 
from dead‐recovery data, it will contain some incomplete cohorts, 
insomuch as a portion of those cohorts have yet to be collected be-
cause they are still alive at the end of the data collection period. 
Consequently, some elements (those in the lower right corner) of 
the matrix C are necessarily zero because they represent individuals 
that have not yet died. For example, the element C2006,15 represents 
individuals born in 2006 that will die (and be collected) at the age 
of 15 in the year 2021. The elements representing individuals that 
have not yet died are described as Ct,j X−t+1, where X is most recent 
year of carcass collection. To account for these incomplete cohorts, 
we adjusted the elements of C that were zero by following these 
two steps.
First, we predicted the total size of each incomplete cohort 
( ̂Ct
)
 
as:
where ̇Ct is the number of carcasses already collected from that co-
hort and lj is the proportion of individuals expected to survive to age 
j. We estimated lj from a survivorship curve (based on l(x) values in a 
life table) that is equal to (Caughley, 1977):
where pk are estimates of annual, age‐specific survival rates. We ob-
tained age‐specific survival estimates by fitting a known fate survival 
model (the Kaplan–Meier method) for Isle Royale moose (both sexes 
combined) and for male and female elk in northern Yellowstone in 
Program MARK (White & Burnham, 1999). See Appendix S1 for fur-
ther details about age‐specific survival estimates for moose and elk. 
From ̂Ct, we were able to estimate the number of individuals yet to 
be collected.
Second, we used these estimates of age‐specific survival to pre-
dict the ages and years in which uncollected animals would die. One 
potential limitation of this method is that adjustments for incomplete 
cohorts will be greater for years close to the end of the data collec-
tion period (i.e. 2016) because a larger proportion of these recent co-
horts will still be alive and not included in the dead‐recovery database. 
However, the influence of these adjustments is likely to be negligible 
in this study because we only assessed age structure for years when 
more than 75% of the cohort had already died, that is before 2007 
for moose and 2009 for elk. Another limitation is that this method as-
sumes no interannual variation in age‐specific survival. However, adult 
survival for large mammals, such as moose and elk, is generally high 
and stable (Gaillard & Yoccoz, 2003). Although juvenile survival var-
ies among years, it would only affect estimates of age‐structure in the 
most recent years of data collection, and we did not analyse fluctua-
tions in age structure after 2009.
The final stage of reconstruction analysis is to use C to calculate the 
minimum number of individuals alive each year in each age‐class. The 
calculation makes use of the fact that every adult (>1 year old) alive in 
year t was also alive during year/t. For example, the value of C1997,8 = 6 
indicates that six individuals born in 1997 all died aged eight in 2005 
(=1997 + 8), as well as indicating that all of these individuals were seven 
years old in 2004, six years old in 2003, etc. More precisely, we used 
C to generate a new matrix M, where the element Mt,j represents the 
minimum number of individuals alive in year t that were of age j years. 
The elements of M were calculated from the elements of C as:
The minimum number of individuals alive in year t summed 
across all age classes is denoted Mt and is depicted in Figure S3.
2.3 | Estimating population size
2.3.1 | Wolves and owls
We estimated total abundance (nt) of wolves as the number of pups 
emerging from dens in spring plus the number of adults counted in 
April (Smith et al., 2015). For tawny owls, we estimated nt as the num-
ber of owlets fledging plus twice the number of occupied territories 
(because territories were occupied by both male and female). These 
observations were made by visiting nest boxes at least three times 
each breeding season (i.e. between March and June, Petty, 1992a).
2.3.2 | Moose and elk
Estimates of the minimum number of individuals alive each year (Mt) 
may be converted into an estimate of nt using independent estimates 
of moose and elk abundance obtained from aerial surveys (Appendix 
S2). More precisely, we estimated nt through a regression that relates 
estimates of Mt to estimates of abundance based on aerial survey 
counts for a subset of years (i.e. years for which aerial‐based esti-
mates were available). The relationship between Mt and aerial abun-
dance counts is depicted in Figure S4 and described by Equation 4 
for moose and Equation 5 for elk:

The resulting time series of nt are depicted in Figure S3. 
Importantly, Mt is highly correlated with abundance estimates based 
on aerial surveys (R2 = .84 for moose and R2 = .86 for elk; Figures 
S3 and S4), which suggests that the overall trends in population size 
that we observed are likely to be robust.
2.4 | Analysing fluctuations in age structure
We quantified temporal variation in adult age structure (i.e. individu-
als > 1 year old) using three different summary statistics previously 
used to describe age structure. These statistics are the mean and 
median age of adults (Coulson et al., 2004) and the proportion of 
senescent individuals in the population (Festa‐Bianchet, Gaillard, & 
Côté, 2003). The threshold for classifying individuals as senescent 
was based on species‐specific relationships between age and sur-
vival (see Appendix S1). While senescence is a continuous process, 
its treatment by this statistic as discrete categories is a useful way 
to quantify temporal fluctuations in age structure because it con-
tains information about an important aspect of skew. For example, 
whether the population is skewed more towards a young or old de-
mographic. We excluded individuals <1  year of age (i.e. juveniles) 
from these three summary estimates of age structure to make our 
results less sensitive to fluctuations in recruitment.
Although no scalar index can convey all of the information con-
tained in a vector (such as the abundance of individuals in every 
age‐class) – these scalar indices still contain important information 
about age structure, such as the mean and an important aspect of 
skew. Furthermore, we used three different scalar indices of age 
structure to ascertain whether the results might be influenced by 
the way we summarized fluctuations in age structure. All three 
indices of age structure exhibited considerable temporal varia-
tion (see Results, Table 1; Figure 1) and were all highly correlated 
with each other (Appendix S3; Table S1). Additionally, our results 
and inferences remained consistent irrespective of which index 
was used in subsequent analysis. Together, those circumstances 
suggest that scalar indices are useful and reflect changes in age 
structure.
To quantify variability in the mean and the skew of the population’s 
age structure over the study period, we calculated the coefficient of 
variation (CV) for each of the three age structure indices. The CV is the 
ratio of the standard deviation to the mean and therefore represents 
a standardized measure of the variability or dispersion of a variable 
in relation to its mean value. To provide additional context for under-
standing our results, we also calculated the CV for population size over 
the study period because variability in abundance has been assessed 
for many species (Pimm, 1991).
We also assessed whether age structure dynamics showed signs 
of being non‐stationary. To reiterate, non‐stationarity is a property of 
a time series whereby the mean and/or variance changes over time. 
Non‐stationary dynamics are typically presumed to be externally 
forced – that is, the result of population dynamics being driven by ex-
ogenous processes that are themselves non‐stationary (Ariño & Pimm, 
1995). We follow Ariño and Pimm (1995) by assessing non‐stationarity 
with plots showing how the sample variance (i.e. interannual variance) 
of the three age structure indices increases with length of time series. 
If the interannual variance increases to an asymptote, then dynamics 
are considered to be stationary; however, if the variance continues to 
increase (with no evidence of an asymptote), then the time series is 
considered non‐stationary. However, any such claims about non‐sta-
tionarity are always limited to the period of observation.
2.5 | Analysing population growth rate
To assess the relationship between fluctuations in age structure 
and population growth rate, we used Gompertz population growth 
models and we implemented these discrete‐time, state‐space 
models using a Bayesian approach (Buckland, Newman, Thomas, 
& Koesters, 2004). These models quantify density‐dependent 
growth (Dennis, Ponciano, Lele, Taper, & Staples, 2006). Thus, 
they allowed us to assess the influence of age structure on popu-
lation growth while also taking into account the influence of den-
sity. Additionally, these models also explicitly account for process 
error (variation arising from ecological processes) and observation 
error (noise due to imperfect observation or sampling methods)

Note: Estimates of population age structure were based on re‐sighting data from marked individuals for the wolf and tawny owl populations, whereas 
estimates of moose and elk age structure were based on reconstruction analyses using dead‐recovery data. Once age structure had been estimated 
for each of the four populations, we characterized temporal fluctuations in age structure using three different indices: the mean age of adults (e.g. 
individuals over 1 year old), the median age of adults and the proportion of adults which were senescent.

We began with a linearized version of the Gompertz population 
growth model:
where xt is the logarithm of the initial estimate of population size 
at time t, βr is equivalent to the maximum potential growth rate 
when resources are not limiting (i.e. rmax; Dennis et al., 2006), and 
βden is the influence of density on population growth. To estimate 
the influence of changes in age structure on population growth, we 
modified Equation 6 to predict the median of the posterior distribu-
tion for the number of animals in year t as a function of:
where βz is the estimated influence of some scalar indicator of age 
structure on growth rate. The parameter, z, was replaced with ei-
ther the average age of adults (ave), median age of adults (med) 
or the proportion of senescent adults in the population (sen). We 
standardized each index of age structure to have a mean = 0 and

SD  =  1 to facilitate model convergence and direct comparisons 
among the different age structure indices. The term, εt−1, is a nor-
mally distributed error with variance equal to 휎2
p, which represents 
environmental stochasticity (i.e. process error, the error not ex-
plained by the deterministic portion of the Gompertz model). 
Observation error was expressed as:
where yt is the initial estimate of population size (i.e. uncorrected for 
process and observation error at time t).
We used vague priors for all random variables in the state‐space 
models for which we had no prior information. For example, age 
structure variables (mean and median age of adults and the pro-
portion of senescent adults) were given a normal prior distribution 
for βz (̄x=0, SD = 10). Process error (휎2
p) and observation error (휎2
o) 
were also both given vague priors, but with an gamma distribution 
(shape = 0.001, rate = 0.001) on precision (i.e. the inverse of vari-
ance). However, using external information to inform prior distribu-
tions can result in better identifiability of other model parameters 
(Koons, Colchero, Hersey, & Gimenez, 2015; Lebreton & Gimenez, 
2013). Consequently, for the βdensity parameter, which estimates the 
strength of density dependence, we used a somewhat informative 
prior with a truncated normal distribution (M = 0, σ = 2, truncated 
at −2 and 2 to exclude the impossibilities). The method we used to 
formulate this truncated normal distribution was identical to that 
used in Koons et al. (2015) and Tallian et al. (2017) and is consis-
tent with the instructions outlined in Plummer (2012). We also used 
informative priors for the βr parameter, which represents the max-
imum intrinsic rate of population growth for each species. For the 
wolf population, we used a somewhat informative normal prior dis-
tribution for βr (̄x=0.303, SD = 0.025) based on the mean of three 
rmax values reported in Miller, Jensen, and Hammill (2002). For the 
owl population, we used a somewhat informative normal prior for βr 
(̄x=0.62, SD = 0.316) based on the maximum population growth rate 
observed for this population and the SD of growth rates across years. 
Because we did not have owl age structure data between 1999 and 
2007, we set the missing values to the mean of the standardized age 
structure variables (i.e. 0) to limit the influence of these missing data 
values on the estimation of the βz. For the moose population, we 
used the same informative normal prior distribution for βr (̄x=0.304
, SD = 0.08) used in Ruprecht (2016), which was based on the mean 
of rmax values estimated in five previous studies of moose (Bergerud, 
1981; Cederlund & Sand, 1991; Keith, 1983; Sinclair, 2003; Van 
Ballenberghe, 1983). For the elk population, we used the same in-
formative normal prior distribution for βr (̄x=0.263, SD = 0.09) used 
in Tallian et al. (2017), which was based on the mean of rmax values 
estimated in five previous studies of elk (Caughley, 1977; Eberhardt, 
1987; Hennemann, 1983; Houston, 1982; McCorquodale, Eberhardt, 
& Eberhardt, 1988).
A full description of state‐space model, including the process 
and observation models and prior distributions, is provided in 
Appendix S4. We estimated posterior distributions for parameters 
(i.e. 훽r, 훽density, 훽ave, 훽med, 훽sen, 휎2
o, 휎2
p) using Markov Chain Monte Carlo 
(MCMC) simulations in JAGS (Plummer, 2012) in Program‐r version 
3.3.1 (R Core Team, 2016) using the jagsUI package (version 1.4.4; 
Kellner, 2016). We ran three MCMC chains, each consisting of 
100,000 iterations, for every model. We discarded the first 50,000 
iterations as burn‐in, then thinned the sample by retaining every 
50th simulation. We considered a variable (i.e. 훽ave, 훽med, 훽sen) to be 
an important predictor of growth rates if the 95% Bayesian credible 
interval (BCI) for that β parameter did not overlap zero.
We assessed goodness of fit using posterior predictive checks 
(Gelman, Carlin, Stern, & Rubin, 2004; Hobbs & Hooten, 2015; Kéry 
& Schaub, 2012). To do this, we generated hypothetical count data 
(i.e. Y.newt) from the state‐space model and used a squared discrep-
ancy statistic to compare observed and expected values from the 
original and new hypothetical datasets at every MCMC iteration, 
that is Tobs =(Yt−Nt
)2 and Thyp (Y.newt−Nt
)2. Calculating the pro-
portion of iterations in which the discrepancy statistics arising from 
the comparison of the original and hypothetical datasets are more 
extreme than one another (i.e. Thyp (Y.new,휃)≥Tobs (Y,휃)) provides 
a measure of goodness of fit (Hobbs & Hooten, 2015). An average 
posterior predictive check score close to 0.5 indicates a good model 
fit, whereas scores very close to 0 or 1 suggest a lack of fit. Lastly, 
we assessed model convergence using trace plots and determining 
whether the 
∧
R statistic for each parameter was < 1.1 (Gelman, 1996). 
Importantly, we found no evidence to suggest that there were issues 
with model convergence or that the models were a poor fit to the 
data (see Appendix S4; Figures S5 and S6).
3 | RESULTS
3.1 | Variation in age structure
All three scalar indices of age structure (the mean and median 
age of adults, and the proportion of senescent adults) varied con-
siderably over time in all four populations (Table 1; Figure 1). For 
example, the CV for age structure indices ranged from 16% to 
58%. This level of variation was comparable to levels of temporal 
variation in population size (with CV ranging from 27% to 42%, 
Table 1). Fluctuations in age structure for the tawny owl, moose 
and elk populations showed signs of being non‐stationary as the 
sample variance of all three age structure indices increased across 
the length of the time series, without reaching an asymptote over 
the 15‐ to 48‐year time periods analysed (Figure 2). By contrast, 
fluctuations in age structure for the wolf population appeared sta-
tionary as the variance in the mean and median age of adult wolves 
remained constant after the first few years of the study period 
(Figure 2).
3.2 | Age structure and growth rates

all overlapped zero (Table 2). By contrast, all three indices of age struc-
ture (i.e. the mean and median age of adults and the proportion of 
senescent adults) were negatively associated with population growth 
in both the moose and elk populations (Table 2). For elk, the estimated 
coefficients representing the influence of age structure on growth 
rates were, coincidentally, the same for all three metrics of age struc-
ture, that is −0.03 with a SD of 0.01. For moose, the coefficients were 
as follows: βave = −0.07 (SD = 0.02), βmed = −0.06 (0.02) and βsen = −0.05 
(0.02). For elk and moose, none of the 95% BCIs for 훽ave, 훽med, and βsen 
overlapped with zero (Table 2), which suggest the association between 
age structure and population growth was statistically significant.
The results depicted in Figure 3 suggest that population growth 
varied from positive to negative for moose, and from near zero to 
negative for elk as each metric of age structure increased over its 
observed range. For example, when average age in the moose pop-
ulation was relatively low (4–6 years old), the expected value of λ 
was approximately 1.1, which indicates a rapidly growing population. 
By contrast, when the moose population was comprised of more 
senescent individuals (i.e. when the average age of individuals was 
9‐ to 10‐year‐olds), the expected λ decreased to around 0.9, which 
indicates a declining population. The strength of the association be-
tween age structure and population growth appeared to be similar 
to the strength of the relationship between density dependence and 
population growth given that the coefficients for βden were −0.05 
(0.01) for moose and −0.04 (0.01) for elk (Table 2). The posterior 
predictive checks that we used to assess goodness of fit indicated 
that the models adequately fit the data (Appendix S4; Figure S5).
4 | DISCUSSION
The main objectives of this study were to quantify temporal fluctua-
tions in age structure, to determine whether age structure dynamics 
were non‐stationary and to assess the extent that fluctuations in age 
structure are useful predictors of population growth rates for four 
free‐ranging vertebrate populations. We found that the magnitude 
of temporal variation in age structure was comparable to temporal 
variation in population size   for the four free‐ranging vertebrate 
populations (Table 1). More generally, the CVs for age structure in-
dices for these populations were comparable to CVs of abundance 
for many vertebrate populations (Pimm, 1991). Additionally, age 
structure fluctuated in a non‐stationary manner over the observed 
time periods for three of the four populations (moose, elk and owls). 
Finally, for two of the populations (moose and elk), fluctuations in 
age structure were associated with population growth and the 
strength of the association between age structure and population 
growth appeared to be comparable to the effect of density depend-
ence for these populations (Table 2; Figure 3).
While these analyses were not intended to be a comprehensive 
assessment of when age structure fluctuations need to be taken into 
account, it may be relevant that age structure was not associated 
with growth rates for the two populations which are strongly reg-
ulated by territoriality, wolves and tawny owls. By contrast, moose 
and elk are not territorial. Territoriality generally has a stabilizing 
influence on population dynamics (Brown, 1969; López‐Sepulcre & 
Kokko, 2005). In particular, territorial behaviour can result in den-
sity‐dependent rates of immigration and emigration, which could 
potentially weaken the relationships between age structure, recruit-
ment, survival and population growth. Indeed, territorial occupancy 
of the owl population remained stable over the study period be-
cause increased immigration of young owls from other populations 
compensated for a decline in local productivity and juvenile survival 
(Millon et al., 2014). Alternatively, it might also be significant that the 
life‐history strategies of tawny owls and wolves differ from moose 
and elk, insomuch as owls and wolves typically have shorter life 
spans (e.g. average life span of 4 years) and higher fecundity (e.g. 
FI G U R E 2 Changes in sample variance (interannual variance) as the length of the study period increased for three different indices of age 
structure: (a) mean age of adults, (b) median age of adults and (c) proportion of adults which were senescent, for populations of grey wolves, 
tawny owls, moose and elk. The relationship between the sample variance and the length of the time series indicates whether a process 
tends towards a stationary, or a non‐stationary, process for ecological time series. Specifically, if the interannual variance quickly reaches an 
asymptote, then it suggests the dynamics are stationary. By contrast, if the variance does not asymptote, then the dynamics are likely non‐
stationary, at least for the time‐scale over which observations were made

regularly producing four or more offspring each year) compared to 
moose and elk (which have an average life span of 10–20 years and 
are only capable of producing 1 or 2 offspring per year). Thus, owls 
and wolves are considered to have faster life histories than moose 
and elk. Life‐history speed has previously been identified as one fac-
tor that can have an important mediating effect on the impact of 
age structure fluctuations on population growth. That is, the impact 
of fluctuations in age structure on population growth was greater 
for longer‐lived species with slower life histories (Koons, Grand, & 
Arnold, 2006; Koons et al., 2005), but this depends on the way in 
which vital rates covary (Gamelon et al., 2016). Nevertheless, the 
finding that age structure fluctuations were more strongly associ-
ated with  population growth for the two species with slower life 
histories (moose and elk) is consistent with earlier work (Koons et 
al., 2006, 2005). However, with a sample of only four populations, 
these considerations are only intended to be suggestive of future 
avenues of research. It is also worth highlighting that although this 
study, Koons et al. (2006) and Gamelon et al. (2016) were all focused 
on vertebrates (mostly mammals), demographic senescence is a 
ubiquitous phenomenon that also occurs in plant and invertebrate 
species (Chmilar & Laird, 2019; Cooper, 1994). Therefore, we sug-
gest that future studies focused on assessing the relationship be-
tween age structure fluctuations and population dynamics across a 
broader range of taxa that senesce in different ways (i.e. reproduc-
tive senescence and/or actuarial senescence) might yield important 
insights about the precise circumstances under which it is important 
to account for fluctuations in population structure.
That fluctuations in age structure showed signs of being non‐sta-
tionary (i.e. the sample variance increased with the length of the time 
series) over the time periods analysed for three populations is sig-
nificant because the future dynamics of non‐stationary populations 
are difficult to predict (Poole, 1978). Fluctuations in abundance are 
known to be non‐stationary over long periods of time for a wide range 
of taxa (Ariño & Pimm, 1995; Steele, 1985). However, the mechanisms 
leading to non‐stationarity are not well understood. Non‐stationary 
dynamics are typically presumed to be externally forced – that is, the

Functional Ecology
HOY et al.
result of population dynamics being driven by exogenous processes 
that are themselves non‐stationary (Ariño & Pimm, 1995). However, 
our work suggests that non‐stationarity in age structure – an endog-
enous factor – may also play a proximate role in the non‐stationarity 
of abundance. As such, non‐stationary age structure and abundance 
may help explain limits in predicting future changes in abundance over 
timescales relevant to wildlife managers.
The extent of fluctuations (and non‐stationarity) in age structure 
observed here (Figures 1 and 2) may also have important implica-
tions for understanding predator–prey dynamics given that many 
predators exhibit strong age‐ or stage‐specific preferences for prey 
(e.g. for juveniles and senescent individuals Hoy et al., 2015; Wright 
et al., 2006). Consequently, fluctuations in the age structure of prey 
populations may alter the availability of preferred age classes, and 
thereby influence prey selection or kill rates (Sand et al., 2012), and 
thereby  impact predator growth rates. The importance of fluctua-
tions in the age structure of prey species may even extend to com-
munity‐wide effects if predators switch to alternative prey species 
in response to declines in the abundance of preferred age‐classes of 
their primary prey species. However, the relationship between prey 
age structure and predator demographic rates is seldom examined 
(but see Cubaynes et al., 2014).
In summary, we provide rare empirical evidence of how age 
structure dynamics can be non‐stationary, which may represent an 
important mechanism by which fluctuations in abundance become 
non‐stationary (Ariño & Pimm, 1995; Steele, 1985) and therefore 
difficult to forecast over time‐scales of concern to wildlife man-
agers (Poole, 1978). These analyses also suggest that fluctuations 
in age structure were sometimes significantly linked to population 
growth and that the strength of the relationship between age 
structure and population growth was of a similar magnitude to 
that of density dependence for the two populations of non‐terri-
torial species with slower life histories (moose and elk). The results 
highlighted above are significant because many analyses used to 
inform management decisions have traditionally assumed that 
populations are fixed at a stable age distribution (but see Caswell, 
2007), or they have assumed that population dynamics are inde-
pendent of density and that vital rates and age structure are in-
fluenced by environmental processes that are stationary (Haridas 
et al., 2009; Stott et al., 2011). Ignoring non‐stable fluctuations in 
population structure may result in the failure or misevaluation of 
management efforts because the short‐term ‘transient’ dynamics 
that occur when the population deviates from the hypothetical 
stable age structure can differ substantially from the expected 
long‐term stable growth rate (Koons et al., 2005). Indeed, a recent 
study on a wide range of plant species revealed that >50% of the 
variation in observed population dynamics was attributed to ‘tran-
sient’ growth caused by deviation from the hypothetical stable 
stage structure, as opposed to the ‘stable’ or asymptotic growth 
contributed by vital rates (McDonald, Stott, Townley, & Hodgson, 
2016). Lastly, our work highlights how future research might focus 
on using Bayesian models to more finely partition process variance 
into the relative contributions of stable and nonstable exogenous 
drivers and endogenous drivers, including environmental stochas-
ticity, demographic stochasticity and the nonstable components 
determined by the difference between the actual age structure 
and the hypothetical stable age structure of the population. Thus, 
overall our work supports the view that fluctuations in age struc-
ture are important for understanding variable population dynam-
ics (Ellis & Crone, 2013; Gamelon et al., 2016; Koons et al., 2005; 
McDonald et al., 2016; Pelletier, Moyes, Clutton‐Brock, & Coulson, 
2012) and emphasizes the need for populations to be modelled 
using approaches that allow for transient dynamics, density de-
pendence and non‐stationary environments.
