Abstract
Objective
To identify neuronal surface antibodies in opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia syndrome (OMAS)
using contemporary antigen discovery methodology.
Methods
OMAS patient serum immunoglobulin G immunohistochemistry using age-equivalent rat
cerebellar tissue was followed by immunoprecipitation, gel electrophoresis, and mass spec-
trometry. Data are available via ProteomeXchange (identiﬁer PXD009578). This generated
a list of potential neuronal surface cerebellar autoantigens. Live cell-based assays were used to
conﬁrm membrane-surface antigens and adsorb antigen-speciﬁc immunoglobulin Gs. The
serologic results were compared to the clinical data.
Results
Four of the 6 OMAS sera tested bound rat cerebellar sections. Two of these sera with similar
immunoreactivities were used in immunoprecipitation experiments using cerebellum from
postnatal rat pups (P18). Mass spectrometry identiﬁed 12 cell-surface proteins, of which
glutamate receptor δ2 (GluD2), a predominately cerebellar-expressed protein, was found at
a 3-fold-higher concentration than the other 11 proteins. Antibodies to GluD2 were identiﬁed
in 14/16 (87%) OMAS samples, compared with 5/139 (5%) pediatric and 1/38 (2.6%) adult
serum controls (p < 0.0001), and in 2/4 sera from patients with neuroblastoma without
neurologic features. Adsorption of positive OMAS sera against GluD2-transfected cells sub-
stantially reduced but did not eliminate reactivity toward cerebellar sections.
Conclusion
Autoantibodies to GluD2 are common in patients with OMAS, bind to surface determinants,
and are potentially pathogenic.

Opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia syndrome (OMAS), also known
as “dancing eye syndrome,” is a rare disorder that mainly aﬀects
children. OMAS is characterized by conjugate, asynchronous,
multidirectional eye movements (opsoclonus), myoclonus,
ataxia, behavioral and sleep disturbance, and sometimes cog-
nitive decline.1–3 The clinical and imaging assessment of the
disease suggest involvement of the cerebellum and/or pontine
omnipause neurons. MRI in the acute phase is usually normal,
but recently, patients with long-standing OMAS have been
shown to have a reduction in the cerebellar gray matter volume,
especially in the vermis and ﬂocculonodular lobes, alongside
a more generalized reduction in cortical thickness.4
In pediatric OMAS, the age at onset is typically within the
relatively narrow 12- to 36-month age range.2,5 Furthermore,
OMAS associates with an underlying neuroblastoma in ap-
proximately 50% of pediatric patients.1,6 Neuroblastoma is the
most common solid tumor of childhood, derived from the
sympathetic nervous system, and occurs almost exclusively in
infancy and early childhood, with a median peak age between
18 and 24 months.7
While the precise pathogenesis of OMAS is undeﬁned, the
close association with neuroblastoma strongly suggests a par-
aneoplastic autoimmune process. B cell expansions with ele-
vated levels of B cell activating factor have been shown in the
CSF of patients with OMAS,8,9 and an HLA association has
been established in some patients.10 Moreover, the neuro-
blastomas have marked lymphocytic inﬁltrates, akin to the
thymic histology observed in early-onset myasthenia gravis.11
Finally, some studies describe binding of OMAS patient se-
rum immunoglobulins to Purkinje cells, the surface of cere-
bellar dendritic arborizations, and to a few candidate neuronal
proteins, although no reproducible antigenic targets have yet
been established.11–15 Indeed, in one recent study, serum
immunoglobulin G (IgG) precipitated 7 neuronal proteins
found in neuroblastoma cell lines but none were shown to be
direct targets of the autoantibodies.16
The striking overlap of symptom onset in OMAS and the peak
age of neuroblastoma detection led us to hypothesize that this
temporal juxtaposition was important in the pathogenesis of
OMAS. Furthermore, the above observations strongly impli-
cate cerebellar structures in disease etiology. Therefore, in our
search for putative pathogenic autoantibodies in OMAS, we
hypothesized an advantage to using cerebellar tissue repre-
sentative of humans at approximately 2 years of age. Here, we
combine immunohistology, immunoprecipitation, mass spec-
trometry, and bioinformatic techniques on age-equivalent rat
cerebellar tissue and identiﬁed autoantibodies to the extracel-
lular domain of glutamate receptor δ2 (GluD2) in the sera of
pediatric patients with OMAS.
Methods
Patient material
OMAS serum samples (data available from Dryad, table 1,
doi.org/10.5061/dryad.tq61224) were collected at diagnosis
from 16 children (median age 2 years, range 1–8.5 years);
further samples were available at 48 weeks in 5 of these
patients. Eight (53%) were male and 11 (73%) had an asso-
ciated neuroblastoma. As outlined in the table, disease control
sera were available from children with new-onset epilepsy
(median age 2.2 years, range 0.5–3 years, n = 78), Rasmussen
encephalitis (age 8.2 years, range 1–18 years, n = 23) and
autoimmune and other forms of encephalitis (age 8.25 years,
range 0.4–15 years, n = 38), and from healthy adult controls
(n = 37). Resected neuroblastoma tissue from one patient
(18-month-old female) was available for study. Sera from 4
patients with neuroblastoma but without neurologic dys-
function (absence or presence of neurologic syndrome is
a recorded ﬁeld) were obtained from the Children’s Cancer
and Leukaemia and Tissue Bank, Leicester Royal Inﬁrmary.
Cerebellar tissue staining
Sprague-Dawley rats (P18, and adult) were perfused with saline
(0.9%) under deep anesthesia. The brains were ﬂash-frozen in
isopentane at −40°C. Frozen rat brain sections (12 μm thick)
were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde (15 minutes at room
temperature [RT]). Sections were incubated with sera or
commercial antibodies (1:100–1:200) before incubation with
biotinylated goat anti-human antibody (1:200; Vector Labo-
ratories, Burlingame, CA). ABC complex (Elite kit; Vector
Laboratories) and diaminobenzidine (0.5 mg/mL plus 0.03%
of H2O2) were used to develop the reaction. For immunoﬂu-
orescence, sections were incubated with commercial antibodies
or serum (1:100–1:200) before ﬁxation (15 minutes, RT). IgG
binding was detected with a species-appropriate ﬂuorescently
labeled Alexa Fluor secondary antibody (ThermoFisher Sci-
entiﬁc, Waltham, MA) and counterstained with DAPI (4’,6-
diamidino-2-phenylindole). Further details are presented in
ﬁgure legends and data available from Dryad (Methods, doi.
org/10.5061/dryad.tq61224).
Neuroblastoma immunofluorescence
The neuroblastoma tissue from one patient (OMAS 15) was
frozen in OCT (Fisher Healthcare). For immunoﬂuorescence,
neuroblastoma sections were incubated with commercial

Isolation of autoantigens
The 2 OMAS sera with the strongest binding to the cerebellum
and the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) and pooled healthy
control serum were used for the discovery of autoantigens via
immunoprecipitation and analysis by mass spectrometry. Post-
natal day 18 rat cerebellum was gently triturated and washed
with phosphate-buﬀered saline, then incubated with 85 to 100
μL undiluted patient or control serum for 60 minutes with
occasional inversion before the addition of solubilization buﬀer
(150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100,
protease inhibitor cocktail [P8340; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO]) for 60 minutes on ice. The suspension was harvested after
2 rounds of centrifugation (2,000g for 5 minutes). Protein
G Sepharose beads (Sigma) were added to the supernatant
(3 hours at 4°C) to bind the bound antibody-antigen complexes,
then extensively washed stepwise (150 mM through 1 M NaCl
in solubilization buﬀer). The IgG-bound proteins were eluted by
heating the Protein G Sepharose beads to 90°C in Laemmli
sample buﬀer and the eluted proteins were electrophoresed
(4%–12% sodium dodecyl sulfate gradient gel [WG1402;
Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA]). The protein bands were visualized
with Imperial blue stain (ThermoFisher).
Analysis by mass spectrometry
Eluates from the immunoprecipitation were prepared for
liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry by pool-
ing the Laemmli sample buﬀer eluted immunoprecipitate
fractions followed by chloroform-methanol precipitation.
Mass spectrometry was performed using data-dependent
acquisition on a Thermo Q Exactive mass spectrometer (data
available from Dryad, Methods, doi.org/10.5061/dryad.
tq61224). Methods for ﬁltering of protein hits are illustrated
in ﬁgure 1 and data available from Dryad (table 2, doi.org/10.
5061/dryad.tq61224).
Cell-based assays
Complementary DNA encoding the full-length human GluD2
mature polypeptide (GenBank ID NM_001510; Asp24-
Ile1007) was cloned into the pHLsec vector (PMID:
17001101), immediately downstream of the secretion signal
sequence and an external hemagglutinin (HA) peptide
(YPYDVPDYA), and was used in a live cell-based assay (CBA)
to detect antibody binding. Culture and staining procedures for
the live CBAs were performed and scored as previously
described.17,18 Sera (from 1:50) or commercial antibodies
(1:750) were applied to live transfected cells for 1 hour at RT
followed by 4% paraformaldehyde ﬁxation, washing, and in-
cubation with unlabeled goat anti-human Fc-speciﬁc antibody
(1:750, Fisher A31125), and ﬁnally a third antibody layer with
Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-goat IgG (1:750, Fisher A11057).
Binding of commercial antibodies was detected using the ap-
propriate species-speciﬁc secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 568
rabbit anti-mouse A-11061 and Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit
A-11011).

Results
OMAS serum IgG binding and downstream
proteomic analyses
Initially, adult rat brain sections were used to look for anti-
bodies in OMAS sera. This revealed a distinct pattern of
immunoreactivity in 4 of the 6 samples tested. This pattern
was characterized by widespread IgG immunoreactivity of the
cerebellar cortex, especially within the granular layer, and
strong IgG binding to the paravermal zone, where the DCN
are located; the plane of the section includes the interposed
nucleus. There was no evident staining in the white matter of
the cerebellum (ﬁgure 1A). The 2 OMAS sera with the largest
volume of serum available, which showed this pattern (5-year-
old female and 2-year-old male; both with neuroblastoma),
were used in the antigen discovery experiments.
Our previous attempts to identify putative antigens using
tissue derived from embryonic or postnatal rat tissue (<P6)
had proven unsuccessful (data not shown). Therefore, cere-
bellar tissue of postnatal rat pups (P17-20), considered to be
age-equivalent to 18- to 24-month-old humans,21 were used
instead. Precipitated OMAS IgG-antigen complexes were
subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel

electrophoresis analysis and compared to a control sera (n =
5). A band of approximately 100 to 110 kDa was identiﬁed
from OMAS patient gels (ﬁgure 1B). This region was excised
from the OMAS and control gels and subjected to analysis by
tandem mass spectrometry. The excised bands identiﬁed
GluD2 in the patient but not control samples. The eluates
typically contained approximately 18,000 peptides matching
to several hundred proteins were isolated from gel bands. To
identify targets of potentially pathogenic autoantibodies,
stringent ﬁlters were applied to ﬁlter out proteins present in
the controls, and from the unique ones, to identify cerebellar-
speciﬁc membrane proteins with an extracellular domain. This
reduced the putative target pool to 12 proteins (ﬁgure 1, C
and D; and data available from Dryad, table 2, doi.org/10.
5061/dryad.tq61224). Of these 12 proteins, GluD2, which
shows high cerebellar/Purkinje cell speciﬁcity,22 was detected
at approximately 3-fold-higher levels than any of the others
proteins and was enriched by 20-fold as compared to healthy
control samples.
GluD2-specific autoantibodies
This identiﬁcation of GluD2 as an autoantigen was conﬁrmed
using a CBA.17 HEK293T cells were transfected with com-
plementary DNA encoding GluD2 fused to an extracellular
HA tag. Expression of GluD2 was veriﬁed with a commercial
antibody against the intracellular C-terminus of GluD2 (ﬁgure
2A; permeabilized CBA) and with a commercial antibody to
the extracellular HA tag on the surface of live (non-
permeabilized) GluD2-transfected cells (ﬁgure 2B). Having
established surface expression of GluD2, we observed that the
OMAS sera (1:50 dilution) used in the antigen-discovery
program, but not healthy control sera, contained IgG that
bound GluD2-transfected live HEK cells (ﬁgure 2, C and D).
Overall, 14 of 16 (87.5%) OMAS samples bound the extracel-
lular domain of GluD2-transfected cells with endpoint titrations
between 1:50 and 1:400 (ﬁgure 2E). The 2 seronegative patients
were male (11 and 18 months old), both with an associated
neuroblastoma. In addition, 2 of the 4 (50%) sera from patients

HEK 293T cells were transfected with complementary DNA encoding full-length GluD2, which had an extracellular HA tag. (A) Commercial antibody to GluD2
(1:200, D13266; Frontier Institute Japan, directed against an intracellular epitope) binds to permeabilized GluD2-transfected cells and surface expression of
GluD2 tagged with HA was confirmed using an anti-HA antibody (B). Sera (1:50 dilution) from patients with OMAS (C) but not HCs (D) bound the surface of the
GluD2-transfected cells. GluD2-reactive immunoglobulin Gs were removed after adsorption against GluD2-transfected (E) but not when adsorbed against
mock-transfected (F) HEK cells. Scale bar = 10 μm. Graph (G) showing endpoint titration of all samples. Samples considered positive (solid line) if signal is

with neuroblastoma without neurologic features showed GluD2
antibodies (table). By contrast, in the control groups, only 5 of
139 (3.6%) of the pediatric neurologic controls had GluD2
antibodies (Rasmussen encephalitis 2/23, new-onset epilepsy
0/78, autoimmune encephalitis 3/38; p < 0.0001, Fisher exact
test) (data available from Dryad, table 3, doi.org/10.5061/
dryad.tq61224). One of the healthy controls showed binding
(table).
To conﬁrm antigenic speciﬁcity, GluD2-reactive OMAS sera
were adsorbed either against GluD2-transfected or untrans-
fected HEK cells. Only GluD2 adsorption eliminated the
binding (ﬁgure 2, E and F). Furthermore, all OMAS sera were
negative for IgG binding to EAAT2 (excitatory amino acid
transporter 2), and cerebellin, identiﬁed at lower levels by the
mass spectrometry (table; data available from Dryad, table 2,
doi.org/10.5061/dryad.tq61224). However, γ-aminobutyric
acid type B (GABAB)-receptor antibodies were detected in 1 of
15 OMAS and 2 of 139 disease controls. Samples at 48-week
follow-up were available post immunotherapy from 8 patients
with OMAS, 7 of which had been GluD2 antibody–positive at
presentation. Only one sample remained GluD2 antibody–
positive at 48 weeks in an asymptomatic patient (data available
from Dryad, table 1, doi.org/10.5061/dryad.tq61224).
GluD2 expression in cerebellum and
neuroblastoma tissue
In light of these ﬁndings, we revisited the cerebellar staining
(ﬁgure 3). Application of GluD2-adsorbed sera to rat cere-
bellar sections revealed a marked reduction of staining in the
granular area and at the site of the interposed nucleus of the
DCN. However, residual staining was still observed in the 2
Figure 3 Binding of OMAS sera to GluD2 and other targets in cerebellar tissue
Binding patterns of HC and patient with OMAS. OMAS sera (green) bound the DCN area (B) and granular cells (C) this binding was partially reduced after serum
absorption against GluD2-transfected HEK cells (E and F) and unchanged after adsorption against untransfected HEK cells (H and I). The plane of the section
that has been consistently cut usually included the interposed nucleus of the DCN area outlined by the dashed line; as no staining was seen in sections A, D, or
G, no line was drawn. Similar results are shown for the bind serum dilution 1:100. Antibody binding was visualized by Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-human (1:750,
Fisher A-11013) and counterstained with DAPI. Scale bar = 100 μm. DAPI = 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; DCN = deep cerebellar nuclei; GluD2 = glutamate
receptor δ2; HC = healthy control; OMAS = opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia syndrome.

sera in which suﬃcient quantities remained for further testing
(OMAS 5, OMAS 14). Also, a neuroblastoma from one of the
GluD2-positive OMAS patients (OMAS 15) bound the
commercial anti-GluD2 antibody indicating the presence of
GluD2 within that tumor (ﬁgure 4).
Taken together, these results indicate that autoantibodies to
GluD2 are frequently present in OMAS sera and target in-
terposed nuclei of the DCN and other cerebellar structures.
However, residual staining after GluD2-speciﬁc adsorption
implies the presence of additional, as yet unidentiﬁed, anti-
bodies that target similar brain regions.
Discussion
Several convergent datasets strongly suggest OMAS has an au-
toimmune basis.1,8,9,12–16 However, despite several eﬀorts to
date, target antigens have remained elusive. In this study, mass
spectrometry and bioinformatic techniques using age-equivalent
cerebellar tissue were used to identify GluD2 as an autoantigen
in OMAS. The expression of GluD2 in neuroblastoma tissue
taken from a GluD2 sera–positive patient with OMAS was
conﬁrmed by immunoﬂuorescence. Given data implicating cer-
ebellar structures in disease pathogenesis, antigen-speciﬁc
modulation of GluD2 may underlie some features of OMAS.
The results support that antibodies that bind the extracellular
domain of GluD2 may be a potentially pathogenic antibody in
pediatric OMAS. However, the IgG cerebellar reactivities ob-
served after GluD2-IgG absorption suggest it is not the sole
potentially pathogenic agent in OMAS, and future studies should
aim to deﬁne these other autoantigens. Nevertheless, links be-
tween GluD2 and several aspects of OMAS oﬀer intriguing
insights and are discussed in more detail below.
The ionotropic GluD2 is a cerebellar-speciﬁc receptor involved
in synaptic organization and thus is an appropriate target for
antibodies in OMAS. Children with mutations in the GluD2
gene (GRID2) show developmental delay, a loss of acquired
motor skills, ocular apraxia, cerebellar ataxia, and cerebellar
atrophy.23,24 GluD2 is highly expressed on the dendritic spines
of Purkinje cells. These cells project GABAergic neurons into
the vermis and DCN, the output cells of the cerebellum.
Modulation of these projections may alter circuitry of the
cerebellum (vermis and fastigial nuclei), the inferior olives, and
the brainstem saccade premotor neurons (excitatory and in-
hibitory burst neurons, and omnipause neurons).25 Indeed,
GluD2-deﬁcient mice, with fewer functional synapses between
the parallel ﬁbers and Purkinje cells, have involuntary sponta-
neous eye and limb movements.26
GluD2 is especially highly expressed at the parallel ﬁber-
Purkinje cell synapse. At this synapse, GluD2 interacts with
cerebellin,27 a molecule that we also found in the immuno-
precipitates from patient IgG-GluD2 complexes. Indeed, by

Sections of neuroblastoma from a child with OMAS who had serum GluD2 antibodies were incubated in commercial antibodies (A) (rabbit anti-GluD2,
D13266; Frontier Institute Japan) or mouse anti-HA (B) (H3663, Sigma-Aldrich) at a dilution of 1:200. The sections were fixed (15 minutes in 3% PFA) and stained
with a species-appropriate secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 568 rabbit anti-mouse A-11061; or Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit A-11011) and counterstained
with DAPI. The sections demonstrate the presence of GluD2 in the tumor. Scale bar: 25 μm. DAPI = 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; GluD2 = glutamate receptor
δ2; HA = hemagglutinin; OMAS = opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia syndrome; PFA = paraformaldehyde.

linking GluD2, neuroblastomas, and the cerebellar nuclei, our
data generate several hypotheses oﬀering potential insights
into OMAS etiology and pathogenicity. First, OMAS is a very
rare condition and pediatric onset is most often within a very
narrow temporal window of 12 to 48 months. It is known that
in this early period, GluD2 expression rises in the cerebel-
lum,22 and concurrently, neuroblastomas, which we show can
express GluD2, are also maturing. It may be this ectopic ex-
pression in the neuroblastoma that breaks immunologic tol-
erance and leads to GluD2 autoantibodies, which can auto
react with brain structures. Second, given the IgG staining
pattern observed with the OMAS sera, the brain structures
that would be targeted by the antibodies include focal cere-
bellar nuclei. These nuclei have roles in saccadic eye move-
ments, omnipause neuron function, and ataxia.25 The origin
of the myoclonus in OMAS is not well explained on the basis
of a purely cerebellar dysfunction and this aspect requires
further investigation.
GluD2 autoantibodies have been reported previously, al-
though largely using methodology that favors detection of
autoantibodies against intracellular epitopes. Several single or
small case reports have described antibodies to GluD2, and
other glutamate-receptor subtypes, mainly in adult patients
with cerebellitis and encephalitis. 28–30 However, the peptide-
based ELISAs used are unlikely to detect antibodies that react
with the surface of native neuronal proteins. By contrast, in
one patient with transverse myelitis following allogenic stem
cell transplantation, patient serum IgG stained both the cer-
ebellar molecular layer and GluD2-transfected HEK cells. In
this study, GluD2 antibodies were not detected in approxi-
mately 300 disease and healthy controls.31
The selection of patient sera and the starting material were
both critical in this study. The chosen sera bound to speciﬁc
areas of the cerebellum, particularly the DCN, while the
cerebellar tissue used for the mass spectrometry experiment
was obtained from rats at an age equivalent to 18 to 24 human
months. Previous experiments using fetal material had been
unsuccessful, which is consistent with the very low expression
of GluD2 before birth, in both rodents and humans, and its
rapid increase post partum.
Despite being the ﬁrst autoantigen with pathogenic potential
described at high frequency in a substantial cohort of patients
with OMAS, our study has several limitations. First, albeit only
studied in a subset of patients, the antibody frequently dis-
appeared rapidly following immunotherapy. However, we are
aware of one patient in whom it persisted for >18 years of active
disease.32 The small sample size (n = 8) and later serial sam-
pling (48 weeks from disease onset) did not permit evaluation
of correlation of antibodies to disease activity. Second, the
serum GluD2 antibody levels were not very high (maximum 1:
400), although, in general, this can depend on the relative and
native cell-surface expression of antigenic proteins. In addition,
this study only examined serum. CSF may have oﬀered addi-
tional information. Third, GluD2 antibodies were not unique
to children with OMAS but were also found in 2 of 4 children
with neuroblastoma but without neurologic disease. We spec-
ulate that these antibodies, which may have increased in re-
sponse to the underlying tumor are nonpathogenic, not at
a critical threshold for that individual, or unable to gain anti-
genic access through the blood-brain barrier. Nevertheless, this
may be biologically plausible as the antibody may have been
induced by the presence of an underlying tumor. The antibody
was also found in a small number (3.6%) of neurologic con-
trols; the tumor status in all but one of these patients was
unknown. However, the signiﬁcantly increased occurrence of
these antibodies vs controls (87.5% vs 3.6%) oﬀers a potentially
useful diagnostic test in OMAS. Finally, despite a marked re-
duction in cerebellar staining after GluD2-reactive IgG re-
moval, some staining remained when reapplied to cerebellar
sections, indicating the presence of further autoantibodies to
additional antigenic targets.
Taken together, our ﬁndings provide possible mechanistic
explanations for the site of the lesion in OMAS, the charac-
teristic age at OMAS onset, and the relationship between the
tumor and the immune system. Antibodies to surface-expressed
GluD2 could identify a therapy-responsive disorder that would
beneﬁt from early treatment and tumor surveillance.
