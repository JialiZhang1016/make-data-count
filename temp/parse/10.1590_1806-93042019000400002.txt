Cross-cultural adaptation of the Zero Mothers Die (ZMD-App) in Brazil:
contributing to digital health with the approach on care centred for e-pregnant
woman 
Abstract
Objectives: to describe the adaptation process of the Zero Mothers Die app, developed in
Europe, is to combat maternal mortality, was brought into the Brazilian context with an indi-
vidualized auscultation methodology for pregnant women and mothers who attended a high
complexity referred teaching hospital. 
Methods: the research consisted of two parts: the participant observation technique was
used by health professionals to translate the platform; with an approach in the service with
online forms for pregnant women, and the content analysis was performed by grounded
theory of the data. During five months, 109 pregnant women and mothers installed the app,
but only 17 completed the questionnaire. 
Results: the women and health professionals pointed out questions such as interactivity,
application interface, content,  pregnancy and childcare clinical management, which
contributed for the Brazilian version. 
Conclusions: the participatory medicine and e-pregnant woman are new premises of a
humanization policy for women and childcare. The insertion of an app with information based
on the best evidence in the prenatal routine in the health establishments with teaching activi-
ties that can provide new dialogue connections with the pregnant women and chances to
update the professional in training.

Introduction
Maternal mortality is a worldwide public health
problem. 
According 
to 
the 
World 
Health
Organization (WHO) in 2010 there were approxi-
mately 287 thousand deaths, the majority were
avoidable and in developing countries. This problem
has so many causal factors that the United Nations
(UN) Millennium Development Goals concluded in
2015 did not succeed in reducing this rate by 75% in
the world, including Brazil.1
The differences between impoverished and
wealthy regions are abyssal. Whereas in developing
countries in 100 thousand live births 239 women die,
in developed countries this number reduced to 12
women. Therefore, one of the goals of the Third
Sustainable Development Goals called “Health with
quality” (from 2016 to 2030), is to reduce the
maternal mortality rate to less than 70 per 100 thou-
sand births worldwide and no other country should
have a maternal mortality rate more than the double
of the global average.2
In Brazil, there are many underreporting pro-
blems that hinder consensus on an exact number. In
a 2002 survey, the maternal mortality rate was esti-
mated at 54.3 on a set of Brazilian State Capitals.
After adjustment and refining, the maternal mortality
in the country in 2011 was 64.8 and was still above
64 in 2017.3
Women who survive severe complications of
pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum have much in
common with those who have died of these same
complications.4 This similarity led to the develop-
ment of the concept of maternal near miss, defined
by WHO as “a woman who nearly died but survived
a complication that occurred during pregnancy,
childbirth or within 42 days of pregnancy termina-
tion” that became a way to verify the quality of
prenatal care.5
Although we are living in an information society,
connected by networks, the lack of information to
prevent pregnancy complications contributes to
deaths resulting from childbirth, postpartum and
abortions.6 The excess of information with no
quality verification, which has multiplied since the
emergence of the internet, also aggravates the situa-
tion.7
Interventions on digital health8 have been arising
throughout the world to address the widespread
misinformation related to reproductive health.
Quality certified entities on health information from
websites, international guidelines in how to design
and evaluate cell phone apps are available for
managers, the academic community and the popula-
tion.9
The Zero Mothers Die (ZMD)10 project consists
of a global collaboration to save pregnant women
and their babies’ lives by spreading technologies to
improve its access to healthy pregnancy and first aid
information. It is a multilateral public-private part-
nership with adherence in African countries, with
UNAIDS, telecommunication companies and others
key actors.
Among these partnership products there is the
ZMD app for smartphones, available for free in
English and French for Android platforms. It is a
digital health initiative on the m-health modality
aimed for pregnant women, mothers with zero to one
year old children and health professionals, in which
the main goal is to reduce maternal mortality
throughout the world, providing key-information to
these interlocutors about health care. The app
consists of a section divided into weeks to accom-
pany the pregnancy and another part divided into
months to monitor child development in the first
year of life. There is also a section aimed for primary
care health professionals with audiovisual resources
for continuing education.
The care centered for patient , a practice adopted
in various health systems, assumes its discourse will
also reach caregivers and family members,11 which
requires participative methodology to qualify the
care. On the other hand, the connected patient reacts
in a different way, interacting with the digital
ecosystem, as what has been termed the e-patient.12
In Brazil, this care centered practice related to preg-
nant woman and child in the early years of life has
achieved in many policies and strategies, in parti-
cular, humanization and integral care on prevalent
childhood diseases. 
Considering the present scenario, this study
describes the adaptation process of the ZMD app
into the Brazilian context, with the methodology of
individualized auscultation for pregnant women
users at a high complexity referred teaching hospital
Methods
This is a descriptive study of an exploratory nature
that has adapted a digital intervention for a public
health problem for the Brazilian interlocutor. Since
ethnographic research has been used to observe a
specific social scenario and processes that are
composed of multiple and changing elements,13 the
current investigation was made on a qualitative
nature using an ethnographic research technique
called the participatory observation to translate the
platform by health professionals.

Cross cultural adaptation of Zero Mothers Die app in Brazil
The research scenario was at the Instituto
Nacional de Saúde da Mulher, da Criança e do
Adolescente 
Fernandes 
Figueira
(Fernandes
Figueira National Institute of Woman, Child and
Adolescent Health), a public reference hospital of
medium and high complexity for high fetal risk preg-
nancies and for children with chronic complex
conditions. It is a technical scientific unit of the
Fundação 
Oswaldo 
Cruz
(Oswaldo 
Cruz
Foundation) teaching hospital located in Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil, whose 2018 structure comprised 12
beds for pregnant women, 14 beds for accommoda-
tion and three rooms of pre-childbirth, childbirth and
immediate postpartum .
At the first stage of the research, a bibliographic
review was made, combined with live and virtual
meetings with a specialist multitask group. Students
of the medical residency programs, nursing and
multidisciplinary as well as other areas involved in
the programs were sensitized and recruited at the
same hospital. They composed an on demand multi-
disciplinary group for translation and technical revi-
sion monitored by the research team and their
preceptors.
The research group was composed of thirteen
researchers, namely: a pharmacist, a food engineer, a
physiotherapist, a pediatrician, an obstetrician, a
pediatric surgeon, a psychologist, a journalist, and
nursing and health worker residents. Among them
there were five PhD professionals, one doctoral
candidate, and six were acting as preceptors in the
residency courses at the hospital. There was a French
native speaker which allowed the group to compare
the English and French app versions.
The translation was done based on consensus
assessment methodology among the specialists and
concluded with a re-translation activity,14 registered
in field diaries. Throughout the cross-cultural adap-
tation alterations were made with multiple tools in
the healthcare field,15 involving translation, re-trans-
lation, technical revision and semantic evaluation,
content validation by professionals in the area, tool
assessment by a sample of the target population, by
means of evaluating comprehension levels.
In the second part of the research, we intend to
present the initial profile of this e-pregnant woman,
the informational needs for the quality of life for the
woman and her baby. Pregnant women, usersof the
prenatal services and of the human milk bank were
approached by professionals at these services to
volunteer to install the app on the pregnant women’s
smartphones and later contacted them to fill out the
online evaluation form. As exclusion criteria, the
option was not to approach women with severe fetal
malformation, whose outpatient service is done in a
different way and on specific days. 
The investigation was performed between
November 2017 and December 2018 and had seven
stages as demonstrated below:
1. Translation of the material performed by a
professional.
2. Revision and adaptation performed by a
multidisciplinary team.
3. Submission of the originals to the ZMD team
in Europe to review and to integrate the content with
the app.
4. Publication and release of the Brazilian
Portuguese version at the Google store.
5. Recruitment of pregnant women at prenatal
and pediatric clinics and the human milk bank.
6. WhatsApp contact and individual fill out
survey.
7. Analysis of the responses of the survey
The approach with the pregnant women had a
theoretical reference based on the Grounded Theory
Data (GTD). According to GTD, the data were
collected and analyzed concomitantly in a circular
movement, aimed at theoretical saturation and veri-
fying the investigated hypothesis.16 The sample of
prenatal service volunteers was non-probabilistic,
which reinforces this reference, that works with the
concept of theoretical sampling,17 and refers to the
possibility of the researcher to seek their data in the
testimony of people who were indicated of having
the knowledge about the reality to be investigated. 
Data collection took five months and was led by
a data capturing team. In terms of the approach, the
team started with a simple explanation of the ZMD
app. The team explained how to download the app
on the Android smartphones. Afterwards, they
invited the pregnant women and mothers’ group
during the lecture activities on prenatal care, post-
partum or feeding at the human milk bank by partici-
pating in the assessment research.
The same procedure was used by the data
capture team in approaching individuals in outpa-
tient care. The women who were willing to join
signed a consent form, received a leaflet with addi-
tional explanations in how to fill out the online form
(see Appendix I), gave their personal email and
WhatsApp contact.
After a week, the research team sent the form
link again by WhatsApp. The content of the ques-
tionnaire was based on the e-health literacy scale
(eHEALS)18 and its configuration was done in
online research software where the attendees
recorded their app experience (See Appendix II).
eHEALS is designed to assess users' perceived

competencies in the use of health information tech-
nology and to help determine the suitability of appli-
cations for public health programs. Afterwards, a
content analysis was made from the WhatsApp chats
and filled out forms and grouping codes. The online
contacts and forms registered impressions, opinions
and reports on pregnant women and mothers about
the usage of the app.
This research was submitted to Plataforma Brasil
under CAAE number 85439418.8.8.0000.5269 and
approved by the Ethics Committee number
3.005.922.
Results
The health professionals held fifteen face-to-face
meetings and facilitated a virtual discussion group
between October 2017 and November 2018.
Activities and observations were registered in
meeting minutes and online chats were filed in the
app. 
Alterations recommended by health profes-
sionals
A first finding was that the app when simulating a
conversation with a pregnant woman and in early
maternity, had addressed the same content, but with
different narratives, in both languages. In this sense,
the research group made four changes that were
highlighted as the guidelines in care in the country
were compared to the international recommenda-
tions.
1.
Procedure of umbilical cord clamping in 
emergency childbirth and prematurity 
In the text related to the seventh month of preg-
nancy, the app raises the subject of early emergency
childbirth. Besides modifying the cold, direct and
synthetic language so as not to alarm the pregnant
woman for no reason, we added in the app that if it
occurred the baby would be considered premature
and would need special care. Giving clear instruc-
tions about umbilical cord clamping for the woman,
a midwife or a layperson was an overall group
concern.
In Aristotle19 studies had already pointed out that
waiting for a few minutes until the cessation of the
umbilical cord pulse, before clamping it, it would
improve the future health of the baby. The reason is
that the additional blood volume gained by this prac-
tice may benefit the development of the newborn,
especially among premature babies born before the
37th week of pregnancy.
Considering the benefits of most newborns, the
American 
College 
of 
Obstetricians 
and
Gynecologists20 now recommend the delay of umbi-
lical cord clamping on full-term and premature
babies, for at least 30-60 seconds after birth, except
if there is any contraindication related to the umbi-
lical cord or the need for neonatal resuscitation.
After many discussions, the final text was
written as below:
"Put the baby stomach up between the mother’s legs. Wait
until the cord pulse ceases. Afterwards, tie two clean
strings or laces around the cord. The first knot should be
made a thumb-length from the baby’s belly. The second
knot should be three finger widths distant from the first.
Tighten the knots. Cut the cord between the two knots."
2.
HIV positive breastfeeding
The WHO and United Nations Children’s Fund
(UNICEF), recommend that in poor countries the
benefits of exclusive breastfeeding must be consid-
ered in regard to virus transmission risk,21 taking
into account that breastfeeding considerably
contributes to reduce child morbimortality rates from
diseases like diarrhea, respiratory diseases and
malnutrition. Included in this context, breastfeeding
is exclusive until six months old and supplemented
until two years of age or more to babies of HIV posi-
tive mothers, as long as the mother has been under
antiretroviral therapy (ART). 
The viral load on the mother’s milk is one of the
major causes of vertical transmission of HIV,
because the viral particles are freely excreted by the
milk monocytes of the infected woman, regardless
of whether or not she presents with symptoms, and
are transmitted to the baby by the nasopharyngeal
mucosa and gastrointestinal tract, which as it is still
maturing, is a virus entry point.22
Antiretroviral treatment (ART) during pregnancy
and postpartum by HIV positive women reduce
vertical virus transmission. However, it is important
to highlight that this therapy does not control the
elimination of HIV-1 in mother’s milk. Therefore,
there is a consensus in Brazil – Ministry of Health23
– that breastfeeding should be contraindicated.24
Other reasons associated with this consensus are
related to late diagnosis and insufficient adherence
to treatment.25
For this reason, the team chose to write in the
app a translated text about breastfeeding planning
referring to the second semester, its contraindication
for HIV positive pregnant women:

“If you are HIV positive, you may talk to your physician
about how to breastfeed your baby without transmitting
the virus. He/she will guide you.”
3.
Tuberculosis transmission by mother, 
family members and lactating women 
In the twelfth week of pregnancy, the team added
besides caring for a pregnant woman with tubercu-
losis, it is also important to observe respiratory
symptoms in the family members and seek tubercu-
losis testing at a health unit as well as mentioning
that this treatment is available for free in the Sistema
Único de Saúde (SUS). (Public Health) units in
Brazil. 
We corrected the withdrawal time for tubercu-
losis transmission prevention measures from two to
15 days, according to the recommendations of the
Ministry of Health in Brazil. It was observed in the
literature26 that a patient is considered non-infec-
tious if they have no previous tuberculosis treatment
history, nor another known risk of drug resistance, in
which after 15 days of treatment it will present a
clinical improvement. However, based on the
evidences of drug resistant tuberculosis transmis-
sion, the Brazilian Ministry of Health recommends
that consideration should be given to obtain a nega-
tive bacilloscopy so that precautions with contagion
should be suspended.
4.
Mother and baby always included in the
discourse 
At the first meetings with the multidisciplinary
team of professionals involved in the research, the
fact that the app focused on the health of the preg-
nant woman, mother and baby was highlighted, and
despite have included in the content very important
aspects about the health of the pregnant woman,
mother and baby, it did not include a slightly more
'inclusive' welcome on healthcare for the main inter-
locutor and user of the app, which is, the mother.
Although the original texts in the app bring
aspects related to the mother’s healthcare, they
always had a final appeal, albeit with an “implicit”
intention to be addressed to the mother, the main
emphasis was on the concern the mother should have
about her baby’s health, when at the end of each
pregnancy week the text emphasized:
“If this week you want to do something good for your
baby…".
Although a priori this detail sound trivial,
considering the psychic and emotional aspects of a
pregnant woman, it is important to stress throughout
the texts that the concern is mainly about her health,
calling on her for co-participation and responsibility
for her self-care, as a form of early intervention not
only on her physical but also her mental health. 
Therefore, as the mother is mentioned in the
speech that is directed to her, and at all times
‘perceives’ and sees herself as truly important and
essential at that moment, she will feel welcomed as a
participant in the pregnancy, realizing how impor-
tant it is that not only the baby is well, but especially
that she is well, thus gradually urging her to
approach and concern herself with her wellbeing and
that of the other who lives in her, and thus enabling,
through reading the dialogues and instructions given
by the app, which although 'implicitly' and mini-
mally, will generate the first bonds between her and
her baby.
Thus, after reflections about this aspect’s impor-
tance, this is how the final text was constructed:
“If this week you want to do something good for you and
your baby…””
Pregnant woman and mother’s profile
At the hospital 109 pregnant women were
approached between September and November
2018. All of them received the information leaflet
with the form link as well as the instructions about
the app, which was downloaded and installed on
their smartphones with the assistance from the data
gathering team. After seven days they were
contacted by WhatsApp in order to respond the
online form about their app usage. 
The list of questions was filled out by 17 users,
14 pregnant women and three new mothers. Three
women decided not to identify themselves.
The pregnant women answered seven closed and
one open question. They also provided age and
schooling information. The woman’s mean age was
34 years old, varying between 21 and 44 years old.
All the twelve women who informed their schooling
had nine years of basic schooling and nine of them
declared being undergraduates.
In terms of the relationship between the pregnant
woman and the app interface while searching for her
health information, the electronic literacy results for
pregnant women and mothers were overall and
above average satisfactory according to six questions
presented on the electronic form (Table 1).
756

of the idea,29 is much more than someone who
researches about her own health on the internet. It is
someone who is equipped, able, qualified and
engaged with her wellbeing and her care decisions.
The question with the major implication on health
services has been the third element among this
health team and patient relationship – the myriad of
information on the digital ecosystem.30 It is possible
to perceive from the form responses that there is a
gap in instructive audiovisual information for preg-
nant women. Another pertinent consideration is that
while pregnant women consider finding content in
the app easy, in their opinion, it has a complemen-
tary character for clarifying doubts about pregnancy.
In this sense, it is necessary to prepare the
prenatal team to make qualified information avai-
lable for pregnant women, whether on their smart-
phone or another device. The participatory medicine
movement foresees a transformation in acquisition
of knowledge, clinical team skills and attitudes
related to the patient. Debronkart11 suggest a new
participatory medicine model, where these “e-
patients” change from mere passengers to drivers in
charge of their family health, sharing part of the
responsibility to maintain their wellbeing and find
cures. In the case of maternity, this approach has a
double function, the maintenance of the mother’s
health and of her future baby.
The interdisciplinary team of health profes-
sionals involved in prenatal care must develop the
skills to build a data bank of pregnancy sites,
including discussion groups and patient communi-
ties, in order to reduce the dissemination and influ-
ence of low quality or commercially motivated sites.
The communication channel between prenatal
services and the pregnant woman must be extended
to explanations of research method, evidence levels
and complex health concepts as well as how to
advise patients on searching for information in certi-
fied places, translating the clinical jargon to the
language of the future mothers and inspire them to
get involved in decision taking about their health and
their baby’s.31
Two limitations of this investigation must be
pointed out, considering that the ZMD app assumes
a normal pregnancy: 1) the fact that the interviewed
mothers had been at a high complexity service,
specialized in twin childbirth, infecto-contagious
diseases, hypertension pregnancies, hemolytic
diseases and congenital malformation in general; 2)
the service, although a National Institute, is located
in an upmarket neighborhood in a State capital , and
for this reason has more patients from the host city.
This may influence the high schooling level of the
The seventh question was presented in a free and
open format, gathering a range of observations and
suggestions for ZMD improvement, whose circular
content analysis was planned by using GTD27
combined with the registered WhatsApp chats of the
pregnant women that participated. After re-reading
and combining, supported by Atlas.ti software, three
categories emerged from open, axial and selective
codification:
• Questions and opinions about the use of the
app;
• Interactions among women, services and app;
• Organic modifications and pregnancy compli-
cations.
The synthesis-images demonstrate the code clus-
ters that were laid out on a tree with their respective
citations and co-occurring codes from bottom to top.
The pregnant women who browsed the app on
their smartphones pointed out programming errors
and the absence of some tools that other apps offered
(Figure 1). One noteworthy question was put by a
pregnant woman who made a content observation
related to the Brazilian cesarean epidemic.28
“Some information that I found on the app […] does not
properly encourage normal childbirth and its demystifica-
tion.” (M1:3)
The code clusters addressing among services,
women and app interaction covered topics on
services for pregnant women about prenatal consul-
tation, suggestions for sharing information about
ZMD and activities inside the app for the pregnant
woman, as well as encouraging meetings among the
pregnant women (Figure 2).
The 
highest 
number 
of 
considerations
concerning the app hypermedia was the “conversa-
tion” with the user, where they give opinions about
possible improvements for the app from the expan-
sion of the operational system up to service aggrega-
tion. Many of them felt the absence of audiovisual
resources in relation to their doubts about pregnancy
and baby care.
It was possible to deduce through a WhatsApp
chat one fetal death occurrence (Figure 3) and that
an asynchronous chat from a cell phone app can
comfort and clarify doubts in some determine situa-
tions.

emergencies in health services may be seen in the

researched women. In this study a question remains
if different results would be obtained from women
with different schooling levels.
The ZMD app bets on the mother-baby binomial
and continues an interaction with the woman through
monthly baby follow-up from birth to one year,
discussing issues beyond the clinic such as family
planning.

frequently followed up, totalling seven consultations
at this stage. However, from the second month
onwards the consultation intervals progressively
increases. The official recommendation in Brazil is a
consultation in the first fifteen days of life, followed
by the first, second, fourth, sixth, ninth and twelfth
months of life. The constant evaluations of weight
gain or height is vital to a child growth’s analysis,
and allows early identification of malnutrition risks.
Another important monitoring parameter is the
cephalic perimeter,32 but one or another are
measured on programmed consultations and regis-
tered in the Child’s Health Handbook. 
The family’s participation especially of the
mother, on the growth evolution and development of
the child is a differential in each stage of the process.
In this research data it was observed that 76% of the
participants considering that the ZMD app informa-
tion is effective on decision making about the baby’s

health.
As for women's health, it would be interesting to
change the format for relating the gestational week
on information in the ZMD, because the way it is
presented can confuse the layperson.  One example
is regarding information presented about childbirth
in the 36th week. It is a fact that childbirth may
happen at any moment after 22 weeks. However, the
app format could separate women's organic changes
and complaints to the detriment of the childbirth
event.
In fact, in the 36th week the belly is heavy and
there is vaginal secretion. On the 37th week it is hard
to move, on the 38th week it gets hard to breathe. The
app demonstrates how to clamp a cord in an emer-
gency childbirth but does not fully explore the daily
questions that would relieve some pregnancy doubts.
Thus, the group observation was that two sepa-
rate modules or even different apps, one for the e-
patient and another for the primary care professional
should be taken in consideration.
Inserting an app with information based on the
best prenatal routine evidence from health units with
teaching activities generates two immediate opportu-
nities: 1) the possibility of updating preceptors, resi-
dents and researchers; 2) another channel of dialogue
with the pregnant woman that can be expanded in the
digital health ecosystem. Controlled and longitudinal
studies are needed to verify whether the introduction
of these apps actually contributes in reducing
maternal mortality, including near miss incidence,
when applied to the health service.
