ABSTRACT: The concept of oxidation state plays a fundamentally important role in defining the chemistry of the elements. In the f
block of the periodic table, well-known oxidation states in compounds of the lanthanides include 0, +2, +3 and +4, and oxidation
states for the actinides range from +7 to +2. Oxidation state +1 is conspicuous by its absence from the f-block elements. Here we
show that the uranium(II) metallocene [U(η5-C5
iPr5)2] and the uranium(III) metallocene [IU(η5-C5
iPr5)2] can be reduced by
potassium graphite in the presence of 2.2.2-cryptand to the uranium(I) metallocene [U(η5-C5
iPr5)2]−(1) (C5
iPr5 =
pentaisopropylcyclopentadienyl) as the salt of [K(2.2.2-cryptand)]+. An X-ray crystallographic study revealed that 1 has a bent
metallocene structure, and theoretical studies and magnetic measurements confirmed that the electronic ground state of uranium(I)
adopts a 5f3(7s/6dz
2)1(6dx
2−y
2/6dxy)1 configuration. The metal−ligand bonding in 1 consists of contributions from uranium 5f, 6d,
and 7s orbitals, with the 6d orbitals engaging in weak but non-negligible covalent interactions. Identification of the oxidation state +1
for uranium expands the range of isolable oxidation states for the f-block elements and potentially signposts a synthetic route to this
elusive species for other actinides and the lanthanides.
T
he oxidation state of an element strongly influences the
stability, reactivity, and physical properties of the
compounds it forms. There is considerable motivation for
isolating elements in new oxidation states since this can lead to
new chemistry while also providing a deeper fundamental
understanding of bonding and electronic structure. In the
lanthanide series, the oxidation state +3 is thermodynamically
the most stable species by far. Recent reports of molecular
compounds containing praseodymium1 and terbium2−4 in the
oxidation state +4 are therefore notable advances. Similarly, the
synthesis and isolation of compounds containing the full series
of lanthanides (except promethium) in the oxidation state +2
is a significant achievement5−7 and builds on the earlier
discovery of formally lanthanide(0) sandwich compounds.8,9
In the actinide series, oxidation states range from as high as +7
in the neptunyl cation10 to, most recently, +2 in molecular
compounds of thorium,11 uranium,12−14 neptunium,15 and
plutonium.16
We recently reported the linear uranium(II) metallocene
[U(η5-C5
iPr5)2], in which uranium has an electron config-
uration consisting of a 5f3 component and an electron residing
in a 6dz
2/7s hybrid orbital.17 A cyclic voltammetry study of this
uranocene revealed two electrochemical events, assigned to the
uranium(II)/uranium(III) and uranium(III)/uranium(IV)
couples. Unexpectedly, further reduction to an unstable species
was tentatively attributed to a complex of uranium(I). Notably,
no molecular compound of an f-block element in the oxidation
state +1 has been isolated. Lanthanum monoiodide (LaI) is
best described as a nominally lanthanum(I)-containing
extended solid, with metallic properties arising from two
electrons per La+ donated to the conduction band.18,19 A
uranium(II) complex that by virtue of ligand noninnocence
reacts as a uranium(I) “synthon” was also recently described,20
and the formally uranium(I)-containing complex [UFe-
(CO)3]−was detected in the gas phase.21 Beyond these
examples, a theoretical study has predicted that well-defined
uranium(I) compounds should be stable and therefore
synthetically accessible from a suitable precursor.22
We attempted the reduction of [U(η5-C5
iPr5)2] in hexane
using an excess of potassium graphite (KC8) and 1 equiv of
2.2.2-cryptand. Over 3 days, the initial green color faded, and a
brown solid precipitated. Extraction of the solid into benzene
followed by recrystallization produced brown crystals, which X-
ray crystallography revealed to be the uranium(I) complex
[U(η5-C5
iPr5)2]−(1) as the salt of [K(2.2.2-crypt)]+ (Scheme
1). Compound [K(2.2.2-crypt)][1] was also synthesized by
reducing the iodo-ligated uranium(III) metallocene [IU(η5-
C5
iPr5)2] under the same conditions. Isolated yields of
crystalline material were 55−60%. Reduction of [U(η5-
C5
iPr5)2] and [IU(η5-C5
iPr5)2] does not occur in the absence
of cryptand.
The molecular structure of [K(2.2.2-crypt)][1] features two
disordered units of 1. The major component of 1 adopts a bent
metallocene geometry with a Cpcent−U−Cpcent angle of
163.4(3)° and U−Cpcent distances of 2.564(8) and 2.585(7)
Å (Cpcent denotes the center of the pentaisopropylcyclopenta-
dienyl ligands) (Figures 1 and S1 and Table S1). Compared to
the linear uranium(II) metallocene [U(η5-C5
iPr5)2], appreci-

able distortion of the structure occurs upon one-electron
reduction to 1. The U−Cpcent distances in 1 are also
significantly longer than the analogous distances of 2.504(1)
Å in [U(η5-C5
iPr5)2] and 2.496(3) Å in the uranium(III)
complex [U(η5-C5
iPr5)2]+,23 consistent with the lower uranium
oxidation state in 1.
Compound [K(2.2.2-crypt)][1] can be stored as a solid at
−40 °C seemingly indefinitely without decomposition. In
contrast, gradual decomposition to a light-brown solid occurs
within a few hours at room temperature. Brown solutions of
[K(2.2.2-crypt)][1] in benzene-d6 decompose over 5 days to
give a green solution that 1H NMR spectroscopy revealed to
consist of [U(η5-C5
iPr5)2], [K(2.2.2-crypt)][C5
iPr5], and a
gray precipitate, presumed to be metallic uranium. These
observations suggest that the uranium(I) metallocene dis-
proportionates in solution (Figures S3−S5). In THF, [K(2.2.2-
crypt)][1] decomposes immediately to give an intractable
mixture (Figures S6 and S7). To discount the possibility of
hydride ligands bound to uranium, carbon tetrachloride was
added to [K(2.2.2-crypt)][1]. The formation of chloroform or
dichloromethane was not observed by
1H and
13C NMR
spectroscopy (Figures S8 and S9). Chemical reversibility of the
reactions that form [K(2.2.2-crypt)][1] was confirmed by the
addition of 1 or 2 equiv of the mild oxidant copper(I) iodide,
which led to the formation of [U(η5-C5
iPr5)2] and [IU(η5-
C5
iPr5)2], respectively (Scheme 1 and Figures S10 and S11).
To obtain further insight into the electron configuration and
bonding in 1, density functional theory (DFT) calculations
were carried out. The electron configuration was determined
to be 5f3(7s/6dz
2)1(6dx
2−y
2/6dxy)1. Three electrons occupy
orbitals with strong atomic-like 5f character. One electron
occupies a quasi-σ-symmetric orbital that is an admixture of
the 7s and 6dz
2 atomic orbitals. Based on decomposition of the
orbital into a basis of uranium(I) orbitals, the orbital has 63%
7s character and 28% 6d character. The orbital has a toroidal
shape that is typical for lanthanide(II) and uranium(II)
metallocenes.17,24,25 The one remaining electron occupies a
quasi-δ-symmetric 6dx
2−y
2 and 6dxy set of orbitals with
significant delocalization into the ligands. Several calculations
were carried out to see whether a low-lying lower-spin
electronic configuration existed, but all lower-spin states
discovered lie at higher energy than the highest-spin state.
The bonding in 1 is shown in Figure 2, with quantitative
contributions of the uranium and cyclopentadienyl orbitals to
the molecular orbitals (MOs) provided in Tables S2 and S3.
The occupied 5f, 6d, and 7s orbitals form an energetically
closely packed manifold. The three 5f orbitals occupied by
three unpaired electrons all have more than 91% 5f character
and show very little covalency. The 6d orbitals are weakly
mixed with the nearly doubly degenerate highest-occupied
MOs of the ligands. The 6d contribution in the main metal−
ligand bonding orbitals varies from 0 to 14% depending on the
orbital and is evidence of weak but non-negligible uranium−
cyclopentadienyl covalency in 1.
The molar magnetic susceptibility (χM) of an unrestrained
polycrystalline sample of [K(2.2.2-crypt)][1] was measured
from 2.5 to 200 K in a direct current (dc) field of 1 kOe
(Figure 3, left). Above 90 K, χMT is strongly temperature-
dependent, reaching a value 3.43 cm3 K mol−1 at 200 K,
equivalent to an effective magnetic moment (μeff) of 5.35μB.
This magnetic moment is much larger than any reported value
for a molecular uranium complex even at 300 K,26 including
those for [U(η5-C5
iPr5)2]17 and [IU(η5-C5
iPr5)2].23 Between
90 and 10 K, χMT varies only slightly in the range of 0.98−1.17
cm3 K mol−1 or 2.80−2.90μB before decreasing sharply to 0.43
cm3 K mol−1 or 1.85μB at 2.5 K. The temperature-dependence
of χMT is unusual and suggests gradual population of a
thermally accessible excited electronic state at higher temper-
atures. At lower temperatures, the sharp drop in χMT is
consistent with the onset of single-molecule magnet (SMM)
behavior. Interpretation of the susceptibility is difficult because
of the large number of low-lying states in the uranium(I) ion
involving strong interactions of the 7s and 6d orbitals with the
ligands.27 This leads to a densely packed manifold of thermally
accessible states with largely varying magnetic properties. The
low-temperature susceptibility can be interpreted in terms of a
coupling model where the intershell exchange coupling is
stronger than the intrashell LS coupling (where L and S are the
orbital and spin angular momenta, respectively; Table S4). The
increase in the susceptibility at higher temperatures most likely
results from population of thermally accessible states where the
spin and orbital momenta are not coupled fully antiparallel,
leading to a larger total momentum.
Alternating current (ac) magnetic susceptibility measure-
ments on unrestrained [K(2.2.2-crypt)][1] in zero dc field
revealed slow relaxation of the magnetization and SMM
properties. The imaginary component of the ac susceptibility
(χ″) shows frequency (ν)-dependent maxima at T = 2.3−8 K
(Figure 3 center and Figures S12 and S13). The relaxation
times (τ) were extracted from these data, and the temperature
dependence of τ was fitted using τ−1 = τ0
−1 exp(−Ueff/kBT)
(i.e., only an Orbach term), which yielded an effective energy

The field dependence of the magnetization was measured for
[K(2.2.2-crypt)][1] at 2 K on both the unrestrained material
and the material restrained in glass wool. In fields below
approximately 20 kOe, the two data sets are similar, with
magnetic torque effects becoming evident only at higher fields.

very narrow hysteresis loops were observed (Figure 3, right).
This behavior is reminiscent of the neptunium(IV) compound
neptunocene or [Np(η8-COT)2] (COT = cyclooctatetraen-
yl).28
The 5f3(7s/6dz
2)1(6dx
2−y
2 /6dxy)1 configuration of uranium-
(I) in [K(2.2.2-crypt)][1] produced a rhombic powder X-band
EPR spectrum at 10 K with g factors of 4.7, 1.6, and 1.2
(Figure S15). In contrast, the non-Kramers uranium(II) center
in [U(η5-C5
iPr5)2] is EPR-silent (Figure S16). The UV/vis/
NIR spectrum of [K(2.2.2-crypt)][1] in benzene is essentially
featureless except for intense charge transfer absorptions in the
UV region and weak absorptions from 800 to 1450 nm
(Figures S17 and S18).
Since complexes of uranium in low oxidation states can be
multielectron donors toward small molecules,29 we were
interested to see how [K(2.2.2-crypt)][1] would behave
toward azobenzene, N2Ph2. Adding 1 equiv of azobenzene to
[K(2.2.2-crypt)][1] in benzene caused a color change from
brown to green and precipitation of a dark-brown solid
(Scheme 1). 1H NMR spectroscopy revealed the formation of
[U(η5-C5
iPr5)2] (Figures S19 and S20), suggesting that a one-
electron transfer process had occurred. The precipitate was
identified by X-ray crystallography and IR and EPR spectros-
copies to be the azobenzene radical anion [N2Ph2]−as the salt
of [K(2.2.2-crypt)]+ (Table S1 and Figures S21−S24). This
one-electron reduction process contrasts to that shown by the
uranium(II) complex [U{N(SiMe3)2}3]−toward azobenzene,
which initiates a four-electron reduction and cleavage of the
nitrogen−nitrogen double bond in the substrate.30 This
reactivity, combined with the disproportionation of [K(2.2.2-
crypt)][1] into its uranium(II) precursor and uranium metal,
points to unexpected stability of [U(η5-C5
iPr5)2], most likely
due to the stabilizing effect of the bulky ligands.
In conclusion, we have shown that a metallocene of uranium
in the oxidation state +1 can be synthesized by reduction of
uranium(II) and uranium(III) precursors. Reactivity studies,
magnetic and spectroscopic measurements, and a DFT study
are consistent with the presence of uranium(I) with a 5f3(7s/
6dz
2)1(6dx
2−y
2 /6dxy)1 ground-state electron configuration. The
broader significance of [K(2.2.2-crypt)][1] is that soluble
molecular compounds of other actinides and some lanthanides
in the oxidation state +1 should also be viable targets. The
synthesis of a much larger family of compounds containing
lanthanide(I) and actinide(I) centers introduces new possibil-
ities for designing molecular magnets and luminescent
materials and for developing new f-element reactivity.
