Abstract 
 
The human Ether-à-go-go Related Gene (hERG) channel plays a crucial role in membrane 
repolarization. Any disruptions in its function can lead to severe cardiovascular disorders like 
long QT syndrome (LQTS), which increases the risk of serious cardiovascular problems such 
as tachyarrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. Drug-induced LQTS is a significant concern and 
has resulted in drug withdrawals in the past. The main objective of this research study is to 
pinpoint crucial heteroatoms present in ligands that initiate interactions leading to effective 
blocking of the hERG channel. To achieve this aim, ligand-based quantitative structure-activity 
relationships (QSAR) models were constructed using extensive ligand libraries, considering the 
heteroatom types and numbers, and their associated hERG channel blockage pIC50 values. 
Machine learning-assisted QSAR models were developed to analyze the key structural 
components influencing compound activity. Among various methods, the KPLS method proved 
to be the most efficient, allowing the construction of models based on eight distinct fingerprints. 
The study delved into investigating the influence of heteroatoms on the activity of hERG 
blockers, revealing their significant role. Furthermore, by quantifying the effect of heteroatom 
types and numbers on ligand activity at the hERG channel, six compound pairs were selected 
for molecular docking. Subsequent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and MM/GBSA 
calculations per residue were performed to comprehensively analyze the interactions of the 
selected pair compounds.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Despite advancements in diagnosis and treatment, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) continue to 
be the leading cause of death worldwide, as highlighted by the World Health Organization 
(WHO). The mortality rate related to CVD is a significant concern, as seen in countries like 
Russia, where the annual rate is 614 deaths per 100,000 individuals, placing it among the 
highest worldwide [1]. The human Ether-à-go-go Related Gene (hERG), which encodes 
voltage-gated potassium ion channels, plays a critical role in the repolarization of cardiac 
action potential in human cardiomyocytes [2]. These potassium channels (KV) are integral 
membrane proteins that serve vital functions in various physiological processes. They are 
involved in generating nerve impulses, regulating neuronal excitability, controlling cardiac 
pacemaking, and modulating muscular contractility. The channels are composed of 
homotetramers, each with six trans-membrane segments (S1-S6). The Voltage Sensing 
Domain (VSD) comprises segments S1 to S4, while the Pore Domain (PD) consists of S5, S6, 
the P-Loop, and the Selectivity Filter (SF) that facilitates the permeation of K+ ions (Figure 1). 
Prolonged ventricular repolarization caused by hERG channel blockade can increase the risk 
of cardiac damage, evident by an extended QT interval on electrocardiography (ECG). 
Paradoxically, the use of antiarrhythmic medications to prolong QT intervals poses the one of 
the highest risk of potentials. This risk has been also observed across various drug classes, 
including antihistamines, antipsychotics, antibiotics, and gastrointestinal stimulants [3]. 
Notably, medications such as cisapride (a serotonin receptor agonist), quinidine (an 
antiarrhythmic), astemizole, and terfenadine (both antihistamines) have either been withdrawn 
from the market or highly restricted due to their potential cardiotoxicity associated with hERG 
channel blockage [4]. These regulatory actions emphasize the significance of hERG-related 
risks and underscore the need to monitor and control the use of medications that may interfere 
with cardiac repolarization. Consequently, the hERG potassium channel has become a crucial 
therapeutic target, leading to the prioritization of screening drugs for their interaction with the 
hERG channel during early stages of drug design. International Conference on Harmonization 
(ICH) regulations now require the evaluation of drug candidates for their ability to block the 
hERG channel during preclinical testing [5]. This evaluation has become a pivotal aspect in 
the initial phases of drug research to ensure the safety and efficacy of new drugs, particularly 
concerning their potential to cause adverse effects on cardiac repolarization [6]. By conducting 
rigorous screening of hERG channel function, researchers can identify and eliminate drug 
candidates with unfavorable interactions, ultimately reducing the risk of cardiotoxicity and

enhancing patient safety. In recent years, multiple mechanisms associated with QT 
prolongation have been discovered, highlighting the complexity beyond hERG channel 
blockade. Despite the long-standing recommendation by international regulatory agencies 
since 2005 to assess the inhibitory effect of new drugs on the hERG channel in preclinical 
settings [7], research continues to uncover additional factors influencing QT prolongation.  
The comprehensive evaluation of QT prolongation risk, utilizing the multiple ion channel 
effect model that considers sodium and calcium channel blocking alongside hERG channel 
assay, proves to be more robust than relying solely on hERG assay for assessing drug safety. 
However, a significant number of currently available drugs undergo evaluation using only the 
hERG assay during the preclinical stage. As a result, efforts have been made to assess the risk 
of drug-induced QT prolongation at the preclinical and clinical level. Despite initiatives like 
crediblemeds.org, which aims to provide an updated list of QT-prolonging drugs, there are still 
instances where drugs with unknown risks of QT prolongation continue to be prescribed [8]. 
Presently, the assessment of hERG-associated cardiac toxicity involves employing in vitro and 
in vivo techniques to study the impact of potential hERG channel blockers and understand their 
effects on channel permeability. While in vivo experiments offer comprehensive drug 
evaluations, their high cost, inefficiency, and conflict with the 3R principle (which advocates 
for replacement, reduction, and refinement in animal studies) highlight the need to minimize 
their use. In recent years, in vitro assays have made progress in terms of duration and cost-
effectiveness. However, these methods have also limitations in investigating the underlying 
structural mechanisms responsible for observed outcomes. To address this challenge, 
computational techniques have emerged as a promising approach in drug development for 
evaluating the hERG-blocking potential of small compounds before conducting experiments 
[9]. Computational methods provide insights into the structural basis of hERG channel 
blockade and can complement experimental approaches, contributing to a more efficient and 
informed drug discovery process. By utilizing computational modeling and simulations, 
researchers can prioritize and optimize potential drug candidates, reducing reliance on 
resource-intensive in vivo experiments and ultimately accelerating the development of safer 
and more effective medications. 
In silico strategies, such as machine learning-based classifiers and structure-based modeling, 
offer valuable and reliable complements to experimental approaches in addressing the issue of 
hERG-associated cardiac toxicity. These computational methods leverage large datasets and

advanced algorithms to analyze the structural and functional properties of hERG channels and 
their interactions with potential blockers. By training machine learning models on experimental 
data, researchers can accurately predict the hERG-blocking potential of novel compounds. 
Additionally, structure-based modeling techniques enable detailed exploration of the binding 
interactions between compounds and hERG channels, providing insights into the mechanisms 
of channel blockade. Integrating in silico approaches with experimental studies not only 
enhances the understanding of hERG-associated cardiac toxicity but also facilitates the 
identification of safer and more effective drug candidates in a more efficient and cost-effective 
manner [1].  
In this study, ligand-based QSAR models were constructed using data on heteroatom types and 
numbers derived from extensive ligand libraries, incorporating information on chemical 
constitution and hERG channel blockage (pIC50 values). The QSAR models, developed using 
various methods, proved effective in identifying essential structural components influencing 
compound activity. The investigation of heteroatoms highlighted their role in the hERG 
activity of blockers. By quantifying the impact of heteroatom types and number in a compound 
on pIC50 value, six compound pairs were selected for docking, followed by molecular 
dynamics (MD) simulations and MM/GBSA calculations for a comprehensive analysis. 
2. METHODS 
The overall methodology of this study is summarized in Figure 2, which gives an overview 
of the techniques employed during the study. 
 
2.1 
Construction of ligand databases from ChEMBL 
The ChEMBL database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) was employed to gather structural 
and biological activity data of known hERG blockers. As of November 2022, the database 
contained 14,364 available compounds with their corresponding IC50 values at the hERG 
channel. To standardize the activity values, the IC50 values were transformed into pIC50 by 
taking the negative logarithm (base 10) of each IC50 value. pIC50 is a widely used 
pharmacological indicator that quantifies the potency of a substance by measuring the 
concentration of ligand required to inhibit a specific biological activity. To manage the 
extensive database, a subset of 508 compounds was selected among 14,364 compounds. In 
order construct subset database, a normal distribution curve was generated, encompassing a 
range of pIC50 value spanning from 2.07 to 9.85 (Figure S1). This subset included compounds

with varying levels of activity, providing a balanced representation of low, moderate, and high 
activity within the small database. 
2.2 Building QSAR models  
Schrodinger’s AutoQSAR module was employed to develop QSAR models, initially using 
DeepChem [10]. Machine-learning methods were used to create predictive models for the 
target data. To compare its efficiency with DeepChem, a similar process was repeated using 
the traditional QSAR method. Additionally, CANVAS cheminformatics package was utilized 
to build QSAR models. Physiochemical descriptors were calculated from the molecular 
properties of the 508 structures to enhance model generation. For model generation, Multiple 
Linear Regression (MLR), Partial Least-Squares (PLS) Regression, and Kernel-Based PLS 
Regression (KPLS) were employed. The statistical results of the constructed models, such as 
R² and Q², were assessed to determine the most effective method. KPLS models were 
developed using various types of fingerprints. The models that exhibited high scores for each 
fingerprint were selected, and scatter plots were used for visualization and atomic 
contributions analysis to identify influential substructures affecting compound activity. 
2.3 Investigating the heteroatom types and numbers 
To identify heteroatom types and numbers that significantly influence hERG blockage, we 
utilized the CANVAS cheminformatics package on each ligand structure. To ensure statistical 
reliability, only sets containing more than 5 compounds were considered for subsequent 
analyses. Median values were calculated for each dataset, and a Python script in the Spyder 
environment [11] was executed to perform correlation analysis. The script examines how 
changes in specific heteroatom types and numbers, in the presence of other heteroatoms, 
correlate with changes in pIC50 value. The resulting graphs illustrate the correlation between 
pIC50 value and the number and types of heteroatoms. Comparisons and calculations were 
conducted between sets with the same number of other heteroatoms, while observing the 
variations in the specific heteroatom's count within the structure. To determine significant 
effects, the number of other heteroatoms was kept constant, and the impact of a particular 
heteroatom count was examined. If a substantial effect of at least around one log unit was 
detected between the median pIC50 values of the compared sets, the compound with the 
highest pIC50 was selected from the set with the higher median value, while the compound 
with the lowest pIC50 was chosen from the set with the lowest median value.

2.4 Ligand Preparation 
The LigPrep module of Maestro molecular modeling package was employed to prepare the 
508 ligands. During the ligand preparation process, the protonation states of the compounds 
were calculated within a pH range of 7.0 ± 2.0 using the Epik module. Compounds with chiral 
centers generated up to four distinct stereoisomers, and ionization states were considered for 
each molecule. To ensure accurate representation of molecular characteristics, the OPLS3e 
force field was applied. 
2.5 
Protein preparation 
The cryo-EM structure of the hERG K+ channel (PDB ID: 5VA1) was obtained from the 
RCSB Protein Data Bank [12]. In this structure, the channel is in an open-like state, and the 
voltage sensors exhibit a depolarized shape. Despite its relatively small size, the central cavity 
contains four deep hydrophobic pockets, which may explain the heightened sensitivity of the 
hERG channel to diverse ligand structures. To enable molecular docking and MD simulations, 
the channel was prepared using the Protein Preparation tool in the Maestro molecular 
modeling suite [13]. Before the MD simulations, three potassium ions and two water 
molecules were added to the selectivity filter (SF) of the channel. Additionally, missing side 
chains and loops were filled. The Maestro's Prime module [14], [15] was employed to 
incorporate the missing loops and side chains into the residues. PROPKA [16], [17] was used 
to add hydrogen atoms to the protein at physiological pH, ensuring accurate ionization states 
of amino acid residues. The structural optimization was then performed using the OPLS3 force 
field with a convergence criterion of 0.3 Å RMSD for heavy atoms. 
2.6 
Receptor grid generation 
The generation of a receptor grid is a crucial step in docking studies. It involves creating a 
three-dimensional grid that represents the binding site of the receptor, which is necessary to 
evaluate the binding energy of ligands during docking simulations. The Receptor Grid 
Generation tool was utilized to identify the binding pocket (active site) in the structure. [18] 
The grid was generated by specifying key residues (i.e., Thr623, Ser624, Tyr652, Ala 653, 
and Phe656) located at the centroid of selected residues. (Figure 3) The coordinates for the 
center of the grid were determined as (2.86. -5.97. -1.27) in the (x, y, z) coordinate system, 
respectively.

2.7 Molecular docking 
The docking simulations were conducted using the grid-base Glide docking algorithm [19]–
[21], which systematically explores the binding site of the receptor. The ligands underwent 
hierarchical filtration to assess the complementarity of the ligand-receptor system. Ligands that 
passed this phase underwent energy minimization and were assigned scores. Two docking 
protocols, Glide/SP and Glide/XP, were employed in this study. Standard parameters, including 
ligand sampling with nitrogen inversions and ring conformations, bias sampling of torsion for 
amides, and post-docking minimization of 5 poses for each ligand were considered. On the 
other hand, Glide/XP performed deeper sampling, beginning with SP sampling before utilizing 
its own anchor-and-grow technique. It utilized a more complex scoring algorithm, demanding 
higher ligand-receptor shape complementarity. The Glide/XP docking protocol employed 
standard settings with flexible ligand sampling, Epik state penalties incorporated into the 
docking score, and post-docking minimization of 10 poses. The docked poses were ranked 
based on docking scores, and only the top-scoring poses were selected for further analysis using 
MD simulations. 
2.8 Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations 
The molecules with the highest docking scores were subjected to MD simulations using the 
Desmond. [22] The membrane-embedded structure (PDB ID: 5VA1) was obtained from the 
OPM database. [23] The system builder placed the 5VA1 protein in an orthorhombic solvation 
box using the TIP3P solvent model [24] and a POPC membrane model at 310 K, Figure 4. The 
simulations were conducted in the NPT ensemble at 310 K with a pressure of 1.01325 bar, 
maintained using a Nose-Hoover thermostat [25] and Martyina-Tobias-Klein barostat. [26] The 
system was balanced by adding Cl- ions and 0.15 M of NaCl solution to achieve a pH of 7.4. 
Prior to the simulations, the Desmond software performed energy minimization and relaxation 
of the structure. Each MD simulation conducted for 200 ns generating 1000 frames. The 
relevant MD simulation data were collected individually and saved in trajectory files. 
2.9 Molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) calculations 
To calculate binding free energies and understand the main differences between weak and 
strong inhibitors, MM/GBSA analysis was performed using Maestro's Prime module. [14], [15] 
A systematic approach was employed, wherein MM/GBSA calculations were performed using 
one frame out of every ten frames. The dielectric constant was defined using the VSGB 2.0 
implicit solvation model, with the exterior network considered as a water system with a constant

dielectric constant and the interior dielectric constant allowed to vary. After the calculations for 
each complex, the average MM/GBSA value and standard deviations for each compound were 
computed. Furthermore, to gain insight into the contribution of individual residues in the four 
chains of the hERG channel to the inhibitory activity and frequency of ligand-protein contacts, 
per-residue MM/GBSA analysis was conducted to calculate binding free energies on a residue 
level. This analysis provides more detailed information about the role of specific residues in the 
interaction between the ligands and the protein. 
3. Results and discussion 
The main objective of this study is to create ligand-based QSAR models by utilizing heteroatom 
types and numbers from extensive ligand libraries, which encompass information on the 
chemical structure of ligands and their respective hERG channel blockage IC50 values. 
Furthermore, the study seeks to explore atomic-level features that enhance the affinity with the 
hERG channel and influence the inhibitory activity of compounds.  
A dataset consisting of 14364 hERG blocker compounds was collected from the ChEMBL 
database for this study. In order to manage easily the constructed models, a smaller subset 
database is considered among 14364 hERG blockers. For this aim, evenly distributed biological 
activity of compounds is selected which involve 508 compounds. (Figure S1) To ensure the 
reliability of the collected IC50/pIC50 values, they were also cross-checked from scientific 
literature. These 508 compounds were selected to generate a normal distribution curve, which 
provides insights into the distribution of hERG blocking potential within the dataset. The pIC50 
values for these compounds ranged from 2.07 to 9.85. QSAR models were constructed to 
investigate the relationship between the structure and activity of hERG blocker compounds, 
providing valuable insights into the crucial structural elements that influence their activity. 
Various QSAR modeling techniques were employed to assess their effectiveness on the given 
dataset. The results revealed that the models developed using traditional methods exhibited 
elevated R² and Q² values, indicating superior precision and predictability, albeit with lower or 
moderate Ranking score values (Table S1). Similarly, models developed using the DeepChem 
method also performed well in terms of R² and Q² values, but with lower Ranking score values 
(Table S2). When constructing the QSAR models, having a reliable objective function, or 
"score," becomes essential to distinguish between effective (i.e., stable) and ineffective QSAR 
models. In AutoQSAR, the quality of the models is evaluated based on their performance on 
specific training and test sets. The accuracy of a model is represented by a value between 0 and

1, where 1 indicates perfect predictions and 0 signifies entirely incorrect predictions. The model 
M is then scored accordingly: 
𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒& = 𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦,-., . 𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦,0123 −𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦,-.,|  
 
This formula is designed to provide favorable scores to models that demonstrate high accuracy 
on both the training and test sets. Conversely, it penalizes models that exhibit low accuracy on 
either or both sets, as well as models that show substantial discrepancies in accuracy between 
the two sets. [10] 
Consistency in the effectiveness of the models was observed across various descriptor sets and 
molecular fingerprints. Among different methods compared, the KPLS approach outperformed 
PLS and MLR (Table S3). Consequently, QSAR models utilizing machine learning-based 
classifiers were developed using the KPLS method along with eight different fingerprints (atom 
pairs, atom triplets, dendritic, linear, MACCS, mol_print, Radial, and topological). To assess 
the impact of each fingerprint type on the statistical scores of the constructed QSAR models, 
the CANVAS tool was employed. The same dataset containing 508 hERG blocker compounds 
with their corresponding pIC50 values was used in CANVAS. The results showed that the KPLS 
approach, when using atom triplets, MACCS, and Radial fingerprints, yielded low Q2 values 
(Table 1). However, other fingerprints like dendritic, topological, mol_print, linear, and atom 
pairs produced both high R2 and Q2 values. The models with superior statistical results for each 
fingerprint type are presented in Table 1. Overall, these findings underscore the significance of 
successful QSAR modeling techniques, particularly the KPLS approach, in elucidating the 
structure-activity relationships of hERG blocker compounds. These models offer valuable 
insights for designing potent and precise molecules. The use of different fingerprints and 
modeling methods allows for a comprehensive analysis, leading to a better understanding of 
the dataset's characteristics. The QSAR models displayed a strong correlation between 
predicted and observed pIC50 values. (Figure 5) These models effectively predicted the activity 
of both the training and test sets, demonstrating their efficacy in predicting the potency of hERG 
blocker compounds.  
Additionally, an investigation into the influence of heteroatoms on the functionality of hERG 
inhibitors was undertaken, focusing on the quantity and variety of heteroatoms present in the 
compounds. The LigFilter descriptors were computed using the CANVAS [27], [28], excluding 
carbon and hydrogen atoms. This allowed for the determination of the number of heteroatoms 
in a dataset comprising 508 compounds (Tables S4-S7), providing valuable insights into the 
heteroatom composition within the compounds under study.

The analysis revealed that oxygen, nitrogen, chlorine, and sulfur atoms were particularly 
important heteroatoms in the 508 selected compounds, modulating the inhibition activity of 
hERG blockers. Oxygen atoms exhibited an inverse relationship with activity, as an increase in 
their number within the compounds led to decreased inhibition (Figure 6). Similarly, an increase 
in chlorine atoms resulted in a slight decrease in activity (Figure S2). On the other hand, the 
presence of sulfur atoms displayed a positive correlation with activity, indicating that as the 
sulfur atom content increased within a compound, the pIC50 value also tended to increase 
(Figure S3). However, the presence of nitrogen atoms did not show a discernible impact on the 
biological activity, with no clear correlation between the pIC50 value and the number of nitrogen 
atoms in the compound. Nevertheless, a closer examination revealed that an increase in the 
number of nitrogen atoms from 1 to 3 within a compound resulted in a decrease in pIC50 values, 
but when the number of nitrogen atoms exceeded 3, the trend in pIC50 values showed an 
increase. Furthermore, when there were more than 5 nitrogen atoms in a compound, the pIC50 
trend was not stable (Figure S4). These findings provide valuable insights into the structure-
activity relationships of hERG blockers, particularly concerning the influence of heteroatom 
types and numbers.  
To further investigate the correlation between heteroatoms and pIC50 value, additional analyses 
were conducted by grouping compounds with the same number of a specific heteroatom type. 
This approach allowed for a more targeted analysis of how biological activity (pIC50) evolves 
with changes in the quantity of a particular heteroatom type, while keeping the total count of 
heteroatoms in the molecular structure constant. Figures 6B, S2B, S3B, and S4B depict these 
grouped analyses, offering a clearer understanding of the relationship between heteroatoms and 
activity. Further statistical analysis was performed to examine the quantitative impact of 
heteroatoms on pIC50 activity, focusing on changes of approximately 1 log unit or more for the 
effect of a specific atom on the activity. To ensure reliable sampling, a threshold of five 
compounds in a cluster was set, and clusters containing fewer than five compounds were 
excluded from the analysis. By evaluating the increase or decrease in the number of a specific 
heteroatom while keeping the number of other heteroatoms constant, significant effects on 
activity were observed. To gain a deeper understanding of these effects, compounds with the 
highest and lowest pIC50 values were selected from each set, encompassing both strong and 
weak inhibitors, providing a comprehensive view of the differences influencing the activity. As 
a result, six pairs of molecules were identified, each pair consisting of a strong and weak 
inhibitor (Table 2).

This approach enabled a comprehensive investigation of the discrepancies among these 
molecules and facilitated subsequent analyses. To gain deeper insights into the impact of the 
type and number of heteroatoms in these selected representative compound pairs, molecular 
docking analyses were carried out using the Glide/SP and Glide/XP algorithms. These chosen 
molecules were docked to the pore domain region of the hERG channel. The outcomes of these 
simulations, comprising the ligand-protein interactions (Figure 7) and docking scores obtained 
from Glide/SP and Glide/XP, are presented in Table 3. Following the selection of the top 
docking scores, the compounds were subjected to further analysis using MD simulations. A 
total of 6 pairs, representing both strong and weak inhibitors, were utilized in 200 ns all-atom 
MD simulations. The resulting trajectories from each simulation were collected and subjected 
to analysis. To assess the structural stabilities of each ligand pair at the binding pocket, the root-
mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the ligands was measured in comparison to their initial 
positions (i.e., Glide/XP). A higher ligand RMSD value generally indicates a deviation from 
the initial binding pose, while a lower RMSD value suggests that the molecule maintains its 
initial conformation throughout the simulations. As expected, the results from Figure 8 validate 
these assumptions, as the RMSD values consistently remain lower for the strong inhibitors and 
higher for the weak inhibitors. However, it is worth noting that the pair of molecules 
CHEMBL70 (pIC50, 3) and CHEMBL1257821 (pIC50, 9.85) deviates from this trend. These 
findings provide valuable insights into the structural dynamics and binding characteristics of 
the inhibitors, emphasizing the significance of heteroatom types and numbers in achieving a 
strong or weak inhibitory profile. The ligand-protein interactions were analyzed through the 
generation of a simulation interaction diagram. Throughout the 200 ns all-atom MD 
simulations, various contacts between the ligand and the protein were observed and recorded. 
Figures S5-S10 present detailed interactions between the ligand atoms and the protein, focusing 
on interactions that occurred for more than 15% of the simulation time. These analyses shed 
light on the complex interactions between the ligands and the protein, further contributing to 
our understanding of the structure-activity relationships and binding mechanisms of the 
inhibitors. 
The MM/GBSA results were thoroughly examined alongside the experimental pIC50 data for 
each pair of molecules. Table 4 presents valuable insights into the average MM/GBSA binding 
free energy between the ligand and the receptor. As anticipated, the MM/GBSA outcomes 
revealed a clear correlation between binding energy and activity. Molecules with higher pIC50 
values exhibited more negative binding energy values, indicating stronger interactions and a 
better fit with the pore domain of the ion channel. Conversely, molecules with lower pIC50

values showed less negative binding energy values, suggesting weaker binding and less 
favorable interactions, categorizing them as weak inhibitors. The overall agreement between 
the MM/GBSA results and the experimental data substantiated the predictive capability of the 
MM/GBSA method. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that the MM/GBSA results for the 
pair of molecules CHEMBL70 and CHEMBL1257821 did not align well with the experimental 
data. This discrepancy signals the necessity for further investigation to comprehend the 
underlying factors contributing to the observed deviation in this specific pair of molecules. 
These findings underscore the importance of incorporating both experimental data and 
computational approaches like MM/GBSA in evaluating ligand-ion channel interactions and 
predicting binding affinities. By combining these approaches, a more comprehensive 
understanding of molecular interactions and potential inhibitory activity can be achieved, aiding 
in the design and optimization of effective inhibitors.  
In general, the results are in line with our expectations, except for two particular compounds: 
CHEMBL70 and CHEMBL1257821. While CHEMBL70, a kappa opioid receptor antagonist, 
was anticipated to have a smaller RMSD and a more negative average MM/GBSA score 
compared to CHEMBL1257821, the latter displayed a strong inhibitory effect at the hERG 
channel with a pIC50 value of 9.85. However, the mismatched results observed for this pair may 
be attributed to the state of the hERG channel. The hERG channel can exist in either an open 
state or an open-inactivated state for hosting the blockers, and different drugs may have varying 
affinities depending on the specific state. It is plausible that CHEMBL1257821 and 
CHEMBL70 interact differently with the hERG channel due to variations in the channel's 
conformational state. Further investigations and studies are warranted to explore the specific 
binding mechanisms and interactions of these compounds with the hERG channel in different 
states. Understanding these nuances can provide crucial insights into the design and 
development of more effective hERG inhibitors. 
 
In this study, we also conducted a comprehensive MM/GBSA analysis to identify the crucial 
residues within the hERG channel that significantly impact the inhibition activity. The goal of 
this analysis was to pinpoint the residues that establish strong interactions with the ligands 
compared to others. The results of the MM/GBSA per-residue study, depicted in Figures 9, 
S11-S19, offer valuable insights into the specific residues involved in the binding processes of 
the ligands at the pore domain. The findings of the per-residue analysis shed light on the 
essential residues responsible for governing the inhibitory function of the hERG channel. As

expected, residues like Phe656 and Tyr652 were identified as key contributors, forming strong 
contacts with the ligands (Figure 9). Interestingly, each ligand at the pore domain also exhibited 
additional specific residues that played a role in binding to the hERG channel. For example, 
compound CHEMBL1257578 showed that Val625 from Chain-A, Leu650 from Chain-B, 
Thr623, Val625, Met645, and Val659 from Chain-C, and Met645 from Chain-D were 
significant contributors to the binding energy, in addition to Tyr652 and Phe656 (Figure 9).  
4. Conclusions 
In conclusion, this study has provided valuable insights into the structure-activity relationships 
of hERG blockers and the substructures that influence their inhibition activity. The 
development of ligand-based QSAR models based on heteroatom numbers from extensive 
ligand libraries proved to be effective, with CANVAS-created QSAR models showing high R² 
and Q² values. Among the various QSAR modeling techniques employed, the KPLS method 
demonstrated superior performance, enabling the development of QSAR models using multiple 
fingerprints. The investigation of heteroatoms revealed significant correlations between the 
number of oxygen, nitrogen, chlorine, and sulfur atoms in the chemical structure of the 
inhibitors and their pIC50 values. The increase in the quantity of oxygen and chlorine atoms 
demonstrated an inverse correlation with inhibition activity, whereas the increased number of 
sulfur atoms displayed a parallel relationship. However, the impact of nitrogen atoms on hERG 
channel blocking activity proved to be more complex. It was observed that when the number of 
nitrogen atoms increased from 1 to 3 within a compound, pIC50 values showed a decreasing 
trend. However, when the number of nitrogen atoms exceeded 3, a reverse trend emerged, with 
pIC50 values increasing. Furthermore, having more than 5 nitrogen atoms in a compound did 
not show a stable pIC50 trend. These findings underscore the importance of heteroatoms in 
influencing the activity of hERG blockers. The study highlights the significant role that specific 
heteroatom types and their respective quantities play in modulating the inhibitory effects on the 
hERG channel. Understanding these relationships can contribute to the design and optimization 
of potent and selective hERG inhibitors. 
The utilization of MD simulations and MM/GBSA calculations enabled a comprehensive 
analysis of compound pairs, facilitating a comparison between strong and weak inhibitors. The 
results aligned perfectly with expectations, as strong inhibitors displayed lower RMSD values 
and more negative average MM/GBSA binding energy values, indicating stronger binding to 
the hERG channel. On the other hand, weak inhibitors exhibited higher RMSD values and less 
negative average MM/GBSA values, indicating a weaker binding affinity. Moreover, the

MM/GBSA per-residue analysis identified critical residues in the four chains of the hERG 
channel that play a significant role in blockage activity. Notably, Tyr652 emerged as a key 
residue, demonstrating consistent and diverse interactions with all of the studied inhibitor 
ligands. Tyr652 engaged in the highest number of interactions, accounting for over 50% of the 
simulation time, primarily driven by hydrophobic forces. Additionally, other crucial residues 
such as Phe656, Ser660, Thr623, and Ser624 were found to actively participate in ligand 
interactions throughout the simulation period. These findings highlight the pivotal role of 
Tyr652 and other residues in establishing and modulating inhibitor-ligand interactions, 
providing valuable insights for the design and optimization of targeted therapeutics.   
In summary, this study enhances our comprehension of hERG channel blockage and offers 
valuable insights that can aid in the design of more effective hERG blockers. The presented 
findings play a crucial role in advancing drug discovery and provide significant considerations 
for the development of targeted therapeutics.
