Herein, we describe the design and synthesis of a suite of molecules based on a benzodithiophene
“universal crystal engineering core”. After computationally screening derivatives, a trialkylsilylethyne-
based crystal engineering strategy was employed to tailor the crystal packing for use as the active
material in an organic ﬁeld-eﬀect transistor. Electronic structure calculations were undertaken to reveal
derivatives that exhibit exceptional potential for high-eﬃciency hole transport. The promising theoretical
properties are reﬂected in the preliminary device results, with the computationally optimized material
showing simple solution processing, enhanced stability, and a maximum hole mobility of 1.6 cm2 V1 s1.
Introduction
The solid-state arrangement of molecules in crystalline lms is
the determining parameter for the performance of organic
semiconductors. While numerous crystal engineering para-
digms exist for tuning molecules functionalized with a variety of
supramolecular synthons1 for exploration of improved phar-
maceuticals,2 tuning of solid-state reactivity,3 photochemistry,4,5
and crystal mechanical properties,6 the crystalline order of the
simple nonpolar aromatic molecules used as semiconductors is
typically more diﬃcult to control. Apart from alignment
induced by the van der Waals interactions of long hydrocarbon
chains (the so-called “zipper” or “fastener” eﬀect),7 few reliable
approaches exist that can improve solubility and control solid-
state order in simple aromatic structures. Nearly twenty years
ago, we introduced silylethyne substitution as a simple method
to increase stability, improve solubility, and induce p-stacking
in aromatic molecules.8,9 This functionalization strategy has
been
applied
to
acenes,10–16
heteroacenes,17–25
indeno-
uorenes,26 benzo-thiadiazoles,27 zethrene,28 and others,29–32
typically via a simple alkynylation sequence,33 to yield new
materials for transistor,34–38 photovoltaic,39–44 imaging,45 light-
emitting,46,47 and other applications.48–50 While this approach is
relatively general in scope, it cannot be applied to a number of
promising chromophores due to diﬃculties in preparing the
necessary precursors, or to the delicacy of certain chromo-
phores that preclude ethynylation.
In order to both apply silylethyne functionality to a more
general class of materials and, at the same time, integrate
computation-based guidance to assess a derivative's likeli-
hood for high performance in an application, we envisioned
developing a “universal crystal engineering core” that could be
orthogonally derivatized to allow manipulation of the prop-
erties of the aromatic backbone while still exploiting the
versatility of silylethyne-based crystal engineering strategies to
modify the solid-state ordering. Through simple functionali-
zation strategies our universal crystal engineering core could
be used, along with feedback from computation, to develop
high-performance
materials.

straightforward – simple and scalable preparation, amenable
to addition of functionalized alkynes to tune crystal packing,
and halogen “handles” to allow attachment of the chromo-
phores of interest. Further, silylethyne-based crystal engi-
neering typically works best with roughly linear molecules,
which suggests that the core should terminate in ve-
membered rings; as such, a benzodithiophene (BDT) core
appeared to be an ideal scaﬀold. We report here our rst
example of our modular crystal engineering approach to new
organic materials; the development of stable, new molecules
for organic eld-eﬀect transistors (OFETs).
Results and discussion
Design and synthesis of universal crystal engineering core
Our approach begins with the development of a multi-gram
synthetic approach to diiodo-benzodithiophene quinone, 2,
through a novel, scalable method that obviates the need for
cryogenic temperatures (Fig. 1a).51 The crystal engineering
silylethyne
handle
is
added
by

ethynylation/
deoxygenation sequence to provide the desired core.
The
size
of
the
trialkylsilyl
group
can
be
modied
depending on the combined size of core and pendant; our
previous work produced a model for controlling solid-state
order that relates the nature of p-stacking to the diameter of
the solubilizing group relative to the length of the chromo-
phore.10 Since even small chromophores appended to this core
will yield molecules with substantial aspect ratio, commer-
cially available trialkylsilyl groups are unlikely to yield appro-
priate p-stacking motifs. For our initial studies, we employed
the n-octyldiisopropylsilyl derivative as the trialkylsilyl group,
which has shown promise in large aromatic systems such as
the bistetracenes.30
Screening of aromatic pendants
We employed modied (Farina) Stille coupling conditions52,53 to
attach the pendant to the crystal engineering core, rst
appending benzothiophene and BDT to 2-no, giving products 3a
and 3b. Yields were generally good aer minimal optimization,
producing stable, soluble materials that were puried by stan-
dard chromatographic techniques. Crystals suitable for X-ray
analysis were easily grown from slow cooling of saturated
solutions, and the diﬀraction measurements conrmed the
planarity of the chromophores and p-stacked order of the
materials, consistent with previous reports on bithiophene
linkages.54 To determine whether linking 6-membered aromatic
rings to core 2-no would also yield the planar systems required
for eﬃcient p-stacking, we appended phenanthrene to 2-no to
give 3c. Crystallographic analysis showed a planar molecule,
with strong p-stacking interactions and signicant intermo-
lecular overlap. Finally, applying this approach to some of the
more delicate chromophores of interest to the organic elec-
tronics community, we coupled both tetrathiafulvalene (TTF)55
and azulene to 2-no. Here again, the products were stable,
soluble, crystalline materials with planar backbones and
strongly p-stacked arrangements in the solid state. All struc-
tures have been submitted to the Cambridge Crystallographic
Data Centre – registry numbers can be found in the ESI.†
The photophysical properties of the chromophore-core-
chromophore
systems
are
determined
by
the
appended
groups (Fig. S1†). When there is little donor–acceptor character
between the core and pendant groups (benzothiophene, ben-
zodithiophene, phenanthrene) minimal absorption shis are
observed. The azulene-pendant compound 3e, which has
a highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) that is predomi-
nately localized on the BDT core (Fig. 1b, bottom row), caused
a substantial red shiin absorption (the LUMOs were similarly

localized, see Fig. S11†). Similarly, the strongly red-shied and
relatively featureless absorption for the TTF derivative 3d
suggests charge-transfer between the TTF unit and the core,
with the HOMO localized to the pendants and the LUMO
localized to the core.
To gain a measure of the diﬀerence in stability between the
materials prepared from our benzodithiophene core compared to
a prototypical organic semiconductor, tri-isopropylsilylethynyl
pentacene (TIPS-pentacene), the decay observed in the solution
absorption spectra of 3b and TIPS-pentacene were followed
under intense external lighting as a function of time (Fig. S2†).
While the TIPS-pentacene absorption declined rapidly, with
a half-life of less than 15 minutes, 3b exhibited no appreciable
decomposition aer 7 hours under the same conditions. A high
degree of solution stability is important for development of viable
semiconductor inks.
With the exception of the TTF derivative 3d, all synthesized
derivatives adopt extended p-stacked arrangements (Fig. S3†) in
the 1-D slipped-stack motif, with reasonably close contacts
between the stacks. In our prior studies on acenes, such packing
arrangements typically arose in systems where the solubilizing
trialkylsilyl groups were not suﬃciently large to induce the 2-D
“brickwork” packing motif that is more desirable for charge
tranpsort.10 In contrast, 3d adopted an end-to-end arrangement
that yielded a chevron pattern similar to that seen in the
orthorhombic polymorph of rubrene (Fig. S3†).56
Computational selection of candidates for device evaluation
The frontier molecular orbitals (MO) of 3a–e were evaluated by
density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the uB97X-D/
Def2SVP level of theory aer geometry optimization (Fig. 1b,
bottom row).57,58 The intermolecular overlaps of the HOMOs in
the solid state are critical for hole transport, thus for this
application materials where this orbital spans the length of the
molecule are preferred. We observe that the HOMOs are delo-
calized along the long axes of the chromophores to diﬀerent
degrees depending on the pendant groups (Fig. 1b, bottom
row). The HOMOs of 3a and 3b are delocalized along the entire
chromophore, whereas the HOMOs are localized on the central
BDT core in 3c and 3d, and is localized on the pendant azulene
moieties in 3e. Thus, the BDT pendant 3b, showing HOMO
delocalization along the entire conjugated backbone, was
selected for further crystal engineering eﬀorts.57,58
Crystal engineering to improve crystal packing
While 3b demonstrated good delocalization of the HOMO, its
crystal packing was still not optimized for use in devices where
charge transport is the key metric; the trialkylsilyl group
required further tuning to optimize crystal packing for the
desired application. Due to the large aspect ratio of the mole-
cule, we focused on the synthesis of silyl derivatives containing
relatively long alkyl groups, such as tri(iso-butyl)silyl (3b–i),
tri(n-butyl)silyl (3b–b), tri(n-pentyl)silyl (3b–p), and tri(n-hexyl)
silyl (3b–h). The syntheses simply required addition of the
relevant alkynes to 2, followed by coupling of the BDT pendant
to the new cores, allowing rapid screening of solid-state order as
a function of the size of the trialkylsilyl group. Single crystals
were grown and analyzed for all ve derivatives. Molecules 3b–
b and 3b–i yielded a crystal packing that was in-between the 1D
slip-stack and the 2D-brickwork p-stacking motifs,10 with both
showing a clear co-facial overlap of p-surfaces in one direction
(Fig. 2b and c, le), but with slight geometric overlap in the
second direction (Fig. 2b and c, right). The crystal packing of
3b–p showed insulated 1D p-stacks (Fig. 2d). However, 3b–h
exhibited exceptional overlap of the p-surfaces in both direc-
tions,
clearly
demonstrating
the
archetypal
2D-brickwork
packing (Fig. 2e). Unfortunately, full structural renement of
crystals of 3b–h was not possible due to extensive disorder of
both the backbone and side chains, and as such the solved but
unrened structure is presented here strictly to demonstrate the
overall packing motif.
Looking more closely at these crystal structures, careful
assessment of the occupancies of the sulfur atoms of adjacent
BDT units in 3b derivatives revealed that many consist of
a mixture of anti and syn conformers in adjacent BDT units.
This disorder is unpredictable and varied between derivatives.
3b showed an 80 : 20 anti : syn relationship whereas 3b–
b showed a 96 : 4 anti : syn relationship (Fig. 3a). 3b–i was
peculiar as its crystal structure revealed the adjacent BDT units
exhibited a majority syn relationship (Fig. 3b). The presence of
this conformational disorder may present challenges, as the
mixture conformations has been related to decreased device
performance due to increased disorder59 but could also lead to
stronger electronic couplings.60 Unfortunately, with the present
system it is not possible to deconvolute the eﬀect that the
rotational disorder may have on the material properties, nor to
quantify the precise amount of rotational disorder in thin lms
of the materials. We will report our approach to mitigate this
disorder issue in future work.
Computational assessment of electronic couplings
Intermolecular electronic couplings among the frontier MOs
were calculated at the uB97X-D/Def2SVP level of theory based
on dimers extracted from the molecular crystals. The largest
electronic couplings are shown in Fig. 2f, along with the carrier
eﬀective masses calculated based on parabolic approximation
from the electronic band structure determined by periodic DFT
calculations, as shown in Fig. S10 and S11 (see ESI for compu-
tational details†). While the transport properties largely depend
on the crystal packing arrangements, it is worth noting that
intermolecular slip could have a non-trivial eﬀect on electronic
couplings – i.e., electron–phonon couplings could play an
important role in charge-carrier transport. To give a qualitative
description of this eﬀect, we calculated the HOMO–HOMO
electronic coupling as a function of relative in-plane slip within
a dimer model. Aer optimizing the geometry of the 3b core
where the side chains are trimmed down to alkynyl groups, we
built the dimer model with a set of slips dened by the long and
short molecular axes and the intermolecular axis of the dimer.
The HOMO–HOMO electronic coupling is plotted against
varying long/short axis slips while the intermolecular distance
is xed at 3.4 ˚A, as shown in Fig. 2f. From this analysis, it is clear

that there are regions with very small or large electronic
couplings, as expected.60,61 In our crystals, the displacements of
3b–h put this derivative near the region featuring the largest
electronic couplings. We note the eﬀect of side chain trimming
seems to be negligible as the diﬀerence in HOMO–HOMO
electronic coupling between trimmed/untrimmed dimers of 3b–
i is calculated as less than 3 meV. On the other hand, the
electronic couplings of 3b derivatives extracted from Fig. 2f and
g are generally larger than those from dimer models built from
experimentally determined crystal structures, which implies the
importance of nuances in atomic positions. In 3b–h, the
HOMO–HOMO coupling reaches more than 200 meV, and the
hole eﬀective mass is only 0.21m0, making it a prime candidate
for device evaluation. While a small electronic coupling in the
dimer model is typically related to heavy carriers, in 3b–b the
hole eﬀective mass is rather small, suggesting some limitation
in approximating the crystal electronic structure with isolated
dimer models, and it too may be a strong candidate for device
evaluation. Notably, the electronic couplings are sensitive to
even sub-˚A slips of these large backbones; for instance, the
HOMO–HOMO couplings in 3b–b and 3b–h are quite diﬀerent
even though the slips are similar. This result points to the
potential further limitation of evaluating these systems with
such a static (e.g. single-point calculation) representation, and
that non-local electron–phonon couplings could play an
important role in these systems.62,63
Device performance of computationally selected derivatives
Using the information gleaned from the electronic structure
calculations, compounds 3b–b and 3b–h were selected and
evaluated for their performance in organic eld-eﬀect transis-
tors. Details on device fabrication can be found in the ESI.†
Devices of 3b–b and 3b–h were fabricated using an aligned
drop-cast method,64 and exhibited average hole mobilities of
0.15  0.04 cm2 V1 s1 and 0.7  0.3 cm2 V1 s1, with
maximum mobilities of 0.21 cm2 V1 s1 and 1.52 cm2 V1 s1,
respectively (Fig. S6†). Devices fabricated from 3b–h also

dimer with the largest H–H coupling is also the one with the largest L–L coupling. As the crystal structure of 3b–h did not fully reﬁne,
computational models were built based only on the atomic positions of the backbone atoms.

Since compound 3b–h showed the most encouraging perfor-
mance in OFETs, along with the highest calculated electronic
couplings, we further explored performance in devices with
diﬀerent architectures. Bottom-gate, bottom contact (BGBC)
OFETs were fabricated by spin coating the organic semi-
conductor over a Si/SiO2 substrate with pentauoro benzenethiol
(PFBT)-treated gold source and drain electrodes. Standard
procedures were adopted to characterize and analyze these
transistors.65 Measurements performed under N2 on 45 devices
yielded a maximum mobility of 0.45 cm2 V1 s1 and an average
of 0.23  0.07 cm2 V1 s1 in this conguration. The mobility
histogram and the current–voltage characteristics of the best
performing device are included in Fig. S7†, 4c and d, respectively.
These devices typically exhibit large on/oﬀcurrent ratios (106–
107) and sharp turn on (subthreshold swings around 1 V dec1),
however the threshold voltage is relatively large and negative
(20 to 30 V) suggesting that this material interacts strongly
with traps at the interface with the SiO2 dielectric.66 Since co-
planar contacts typically produce large contact resistance and
SiO2 creates signicant scattering at the semiconductor/dielectric
interface,65,67,68 we incorporated the same compound in OFETs
with a top-gate bottom contact (TGBC) architecture,69 employing
parylene as the top-gate dielectric. These OFETs provided
mobilities as high as 1.6 cm2 V1 s1 (Fig. 4a and b) with an
average of 0.7  0.3 cm2 V1 s1 obtained on 34 devices.
The curvature of the current–voltage curves at low VDS
(Fig. 4b and d) present in both architectures is a typical
signature of high contact resistance, suggesting that the
mobility in these devices is limited by charge injection. Such
injection barriers may be attributed to a number of diﬀerent
variables, including an energetic barrier to hole injection,
local microstructural diﬀerences near the electrode that
impede charge transport from the contact to the accumulation
layer, dipoles formed at the semiconductor/electrode inter-
face, or tunnelling resistance of the PFBT layer.70 To further
assess this issue, we measured the ionization energies of both
3b–b and 3b–h using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy,
yielding values between 5.2 and 5.3 eV (Fig. S12 and S13†).
Device performance could thus likely be further enhanced by
improving the contacts.
GIXD evaluation of thin-lm structure
To fully characterize the structures accessed in thin-lms of 3b–
h, and explore the possibility of thin-lm polymorphism in
these materials, grazing incidence X-ray diﬀraction (GIXD) was
employed on both the aligned drop-cast lms64 and spin-cast
lms. The as-cast lms were also subjected to post-deposition
thermal annealing (TA) and solvent vapor annealing (SVA)71 to
assess polymorphic stability, as these techniques have demon-
strated the ability to induce polymorphic transformations in
organic small molecules.72–74
3b–h is crystalline as-deposited by both spin-casting (Fig. 5a)
and aligned drop-casting (Fig. 5d). This is notably diﬀerent
from other trialkylsilyl functionalized organic semiconductors,
such as TIPS-pentacene, which are amorphous upon spin-
coating. The spin-cast lm accesses the known crystal struc-
ture with the (001) plane parallel to the substrate; however, the
dropcast lm adopts a slightly shied structure from the solved
bulk crystal structure (Fig. 5g), possibly explaining why the
drop-cast
devices
show
inferior
transfer
characteristics
compared to spin-cast devices. Both spin- and drop-cast lms
are unaﬀected by post-deposition processing through either
SVA or TA (Fig. 5b, c, e and f, respectively). The lack of poly-

contacts observed in the crystal structure, which have been
shown to screen for kinetically stable polymorphs in organic
molecular solids.75
Conclusions
We presented a robust and simple strategy for inducing p-
stacking in aromatic chromophores by using a universal
aromatic core molecule containing a trialkylsilylethynyl group
to tune crystal packing, to which one can attach a wide variety of
p-conjugated pendants. Each pendant screened here yielded
soluble, easily crystallized derivatives that adopted planar, p-
stacked arrays in the solid state. Selecting the BDT pendant to
demonstrate optimization of crystal packing for OFET applica-
tions, simple manipulation of the trialkylsilyl group aﬀorded
a champion material, 3b–h, which exhibited hole mobility as
high as 1.6 cm2 V1 s1. As p-stacking was observed in all
derivatives, careful choice of pendant group may allow this
strategy to be applied beyond OFET materials, as molecules
with more localized orbitals, like those observed in 3d and 3e,
could ostensibly be used for photonic applications76 by under-
taking crystal engineering eﬀorts to specically optimize the
crystal packing or aggregation for the desired application.
