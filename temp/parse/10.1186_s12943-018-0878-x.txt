Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive type of primary brain tumours. Anti-angiogenic therapies (AAT),
such as bevacizumab, have been developed to target the tumour blood supply. However, GBM presents
mechanisms of escape from AAT activity, including a speculated direct effect of AAT on GBM cells.
Furthermore, bevacizumab can alter the intercellular communication of GBM cells with their direct
microenvironment. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been recently described as main acts in the GBM
microenvironment, allowing tumour and stromal cells to exchange genetic and proteomic material. Herein,
we examined and described the alterations in the EVs produced by GBM cells following bevacizumab
treatment. Interestingly, bevacizumab that is able to neutralise GBM cells-derived VEGF-A, was found to be
directly captured by GBM cells and eventually sorted at the surface of the respective EVs. We also identified
early endosomes as potential pathways involved in the bevacizumab internalisation by GBM cells. Via MS
analysis, we observed that treatment with bevacizumab induces changes in the EVs proteomic content,
which are associated with tumour progression and therapeutic resistance. Accordingly, inhibition of EVs
production by GBM cells improved the anti-tumour effect of bevacizumab. Together, this data suggests of
a potential new mechanism of GBM escape from bevacizumab activity.

GBM is amongst the most aggressive types of brain tu-
mours for which current treatments are of limited
benefit [1]. During the past decades, AAT have pro-
vided
a
rationale
for
targeting
and blocking
the
tumour blood supply. Unfortunately, the effects of
AAT/bevacizumab, a monoclonal humanised antibody
neutralising Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A
(VEGF-A), on tumour growth are short-term and
GBM patients ultimately relapse. Interestingly, since
the expression of some pro-angiogenic factors and
their
receptors
(i.e.
VEGF-A/VEGF-R)
has
been
described in tumour cells, it appears that AAT/bevaci-
zumab also acts directly on GBM cells [2] that might
eventually lead to therapy resistance and relapse [1].
Recently, we identified a direct effect of bevacizumab
on GBM cells and demonstrated its ability to stimulate
tumour cells’ invasion in hyaluronic acid (HA) hydro-
gels and activate key survival signalling pathways. The
intrinsic reluctance of cancer cells to AAT could also
be linked to their ability of disposing the drugs [3]. In-
deed, it has been observed that cetuximab, an EGF-R
monoclonal IgG1 antibody, is associated with extracel-
lular vesicles (EVs) derived from treated cancer cells
suggesting that such processes could be implicated in
tumour limited response to therapy [4]. During the

last years, EVs involvement in tumour development
and metastasis has been thoroughly considered [5].
Therefore, herein we focused on the effects of bevaci-
zumab on the production of GBM cells-derived EVs.
Results/discussion
Bevacizumab affects the EVs proteomic content derived
from GBM cells
Since VEGF-A represents the main target of bevacizu-
mab and in order to determine the best model for
our study, we examined the expression of different
components of the VEGF-A signalling in three different
GBM cell lines (see Additional file 1: for Materials and
Methods). As LN18 and U87 secreted the highest
amounts of VEGF-A, we decided to focus on the effects
of bevacizumab on these cell lines (Additional file 2:
Figure S1a, S1b). Although bevacizumab neutralised
VEGF-A secreted by LN18 and U87 (Additional file 2:
Figure S1c), cell viability and proliferation appeared to
be marginally affected with clinically relevant doses
(~ 0.25 mg/mL), while the only statistically significant
decrease on GBM viability (~ 10%) and proliferation
(~ 30%) was observed with high doses (Additional file 2:
Figure S1d, S1e). Moreover, nanoparticles tracking analysis
(NTA) showed no significant change in the concentration
of LN18 or U87 cells-derived EVs (~ 1000 and ~ 3000
particles/mL/cell, respectively) in response to bevacizu-
mab (Fig. 1a, b), while MS analysis showed that treatment
with either bevacizumab or control IgG1 could modify
the proteomic cargo of EVs derived from GBM cells
(Additional file 3: Figure S2 and Additional file 4:
Tables S1 and S2). Interestingly, the fact that even
‘unspecific’
IgG1
altered
the
EVs
proteomic
cargo,
suggests that GBM cells respond to the immunotherapy.
Furthermore, immunoglobulins peptides could be noticed
in EVs derived from both IgG1- and bevacizumab-treated
LN18 and U87, suggesting that the antibody used asso-
ciates somehow with EVs in a non-VEGF-A specific way.
Moreover, Annexin A2 expression, a well-described angio-
genesis and tumour progression promoter in gliomas and
breast
cancer,
increased
in
both
LN18
and
U87
cells-derived EVs following bevacizumab treatment (Fig. 1c).
Annexin A2 has also been described as a new potential
marker for GBM aggressiveness and patients’ survival [6].
We also observed a decrease in CD44 expression in U87
cells-derived EVs following bevacizumab treatment. Yet, a
decrease in CD44 along with an increase in Annexin A2
might suggest a switch in the EVs sub-populations upon
bevacizumab treatment [7]. Finally, respective patients’ gene
expression in the different GBM subtypes has been obtained
from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). As illustrated
in
Fig.
1d,
Annexin
A2
and
CD44
are
mostly
over-expressed in the classical and mesenchymal sub-
types. Overall, further investigation is required to decipher
whether EVs derived from bevacizumab treated-GBM
cells promote tumour aggressiveness through their protein
content.
Bevacizumab is internalised by GBM cells
We then assessed the presence of bevacizumab in GBM
cells. As previously observed [8], we showed a partial
co-localisation of bevacizumab with EEA1 (and Rab5 in
U87) in GBM cells, suggesting that the antibody uptake
might involve receptor/ligand dependent endocytosis
(Fig. 2a, Additional file 5: Figure S3a). Western blotting
revealed a time-dependent increase of bevacizumab in
treated-GBM cells, suggesting a gradual incorporation of
bevacizumab over time (Fig. 2b). This mechanism ap-
pears to be quite rapid as suggested by the detection of
bevacizumab in EVs following 2 h treatment, which
could happen via fast recycling endosomes as recently
proposed [9].
Bevacizumab is detectable at the surface of GBM
cells-derived EVs
We hypothesised that IgG1 antibodies could end up at
the surface of EVs derived from treated cells. When
compared to control EVs, TEM revealed bevacizumab as
aggregates on some of the EVs from treated cells, sug-
gesting that the antibody is present at the surface of the
vesicles (Fig. 2c). Accordingly, bevacizumab could be
observed in the EVs produced by the respective cells fol-
lowing treatment (Fig. 2d). Moreover, trypsin digestion
could affect IgG antibodies in EVs, suggesting that beva-
cizumab is predominantly bound to the surface of EVs
and is not internalised in them. (Fig. 2e and Additional
file 5: Figure S3b).

Finally, co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed
that
EVs-associated
bevacizumab
could
not
bind
to
VEGF-A. As previously suggested [10], we believe that
GBM cells derived-EVs trapping of bevacizumab reduces
the available number of antibody molecules reaching their
specific targets, thus decreasing its efficacy. Interestingly, fi-
bronectin was detected in both IgG1 and bevacizumab-
bound solubilised EVs (Fig. 2f). Accordingly, Deissler et al.
suggest that endothelial cells could uptake IgG1 antibodies
through binding to fibronectin/integrin complexes [8].
Therefore, it is likely that IgG1 antibodies (bevacizumab)
get trapped at the cell surface through binding with cell/
ECM interaction components (i.e. fibronectin) [8]. Conse-
quently, bevacizumab shedding at the surface of GBM-de-
rived EVs appears as a possible way for cancer cells to
shield themselves against treatment.
Inhibition of EVs production increases the effects of
bevacizumab on GBM cells’ viability
The effects of EVs depletion on the viability of GBM
cells in combination with bevacizumab treatment have
been investigated, using GW4869, a sphyngomyelinase
inhibitor shown to decrease EVs biogenesis. GW4869
inhibited EVs production (Fig. 3a), while, combination of
bevacizumab with GW4869 significantly affected (~ 30%)
the U87 cells’ viability after 48 h (Fig. 3b), suggesting
that inhibition of EVs production could contribute to
the cytotoxicity of bevacizumab in vitro. Finally, U87
invasiveness was slightly increased (~ 28%) following
bevacizumab treatment [1], as assessed by their ability to
form colonies in a tri-dimensional HA hydrogel (Fig. 3c),
while combination with GW4869 reduced this effect.
Thus, the direct anti-tumour effect of bevacizumab might
be enhanced via alteration of EVs biogenesis in GBM
cells. As we did not observe similar effects on LN18
invasiveness, specific molecular pathways might be
implicated in the response to both bevacizumab and
GW4869, as observed before [1]. It is still unclear if
the additive effect on U87 cells is only due to the
specific inhibition of the antibody shedding mecha-
nisms. It might as well be a combinational effect of
VEGF-A neutralization by bevacizumab along with
blocking of pro-tumoral EVs (Additional file 6: Figure S4).
To what extent such mechanisms can affect bevacizu-
mab efficacy in vivo is yet to be deciphered. Still, similar
mechanisms have been described in different cancer cell
types treated with antibodies. Hence, such shedding of
IgG1 antibodies into GBM cells-derived EVs could be
involved in GBM cells’ escape from bevacizumab. As
EVs can be vividly uptaken by other cells, the destination
of such bevacizumab-coated EVs is another outstanding
question that require further in vivo studies.
Conclusions
Bevacizumab has a positive effect on GBM patients’
quality
of
life
and
survival,
mostly
through
its
anti-inflammatory effects. Consequently, there is an
urgent need for the right therapeutic strategy that will
increase its efficacy on tumour growth, thus avoiding
recurrence and relapse. Here, we report that the para-
doxical pro-invasive effect of bevacizumab on GBM cells
might be due to alterations in the tumour cells-derived
EVs, including shedding of the antibody and further
modifications of the cargo, both possibly contributing to
therapeutic resistance. Therefore, this study suggests the
combination of bevacizumab with a local blocking of
EVs-dependent intercellular communication as a poten-
tial
new
therapeutic
strategy
to
improve
GBM
treatment.
