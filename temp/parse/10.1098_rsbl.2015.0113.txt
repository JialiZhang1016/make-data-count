The mechanisms that set the thermal limitsto life remain uncertain. Classically,
researchersthought that heating kills by disrupting the structures of proteins or
membranes, but an alternative hypothesis focuses on the demand for oxygen
relative to its supply. We evaluated this alternative hypothesis by comparing
the lethal temperature for lizard embryos developing at oxygen concentrations
of 10–30%. Embryos exposed to normoxia and hyperoxia survived to higher
temperaturesthan those exposed to hypoxia, suggesting that oxygen limitation
sets the thermal maximum. As all animals pass through an embryonic stage
where respiratoryand cardiovascular systems must develop, oxygen limitation
may limit the thermal niches of terrestrial animals as well as aquatic ones.
1. Introduction
Why do animals die when they overheat? Until recently, biologists have suggested
that heat kills bydisruptingmolecular structures, such asenzymes and membranes
[1,2]. However, in bilaterian animals, heating might first disrupt the functions of
cardiovascular and respiratory systems that supply cells with oxygen [2,3]. This
oxygen-limitation hypothesis focuses on a fundamentally different scale from
the classic hypothesis: organisms die because organ systems fail before cellular
structures do. Thus, the oxygen-limitation hypothesis could explain why most ani-
mals die at temperatures below the functional limits of proteins or membranes and
well below temperatures that cause denaturation ([2] and [4, pp. 410–417]).
The oxygen-limitation hypothesis initially gained support from studies of
aquatic animals, but biologists have questioned whether the idea applies to ter-
restrial animals [5]. If warming causes oxygen demand to exceed supply, the
lethal temperature should depend on factors limiting oxygen supply. Accord-
ingly, a hypoxic environment should reduce the lethal temperature. Although
this phenomenon has been documented for marine and freshwater animals
[2,6,7], no effect of hypoxia on thermal limits has been observed in terrestrial
insects [5,8]. Because the concentrations of oxygen are lower in water than in
air, aquatic organisms may be more susceptible to oxygen reductions than terres-
trial organisms [2,5]. However, terrestrial species still face aerobic challenges,
especially when respiratory or cardiovascular systems are developing.
Here, we show that atmospheric oxygen concentration modifies the thermal
limit of survival in embryonic plateau fence lizards, Sceloporus tristichus. This
species occurs at elevations of 900–2750 m [9] and experiences oxygen supplies
equivalent to hypoxia at sea level (15–19% oxygen). At moderate temperatures,
Sceloporus embryos grow and develop successfully under severe hypoxia (8%)
or hyperoxia (30%) [10]. At normoxia, they survive daily heating to temperatures
below 42–448C (O. Levy, C. D. Smith, D. Kumar, K. Boateng, M. J. Angilletta
2012–2013, unpublished data). By manipulating oxygen concentration and ther-
mal stress, we show that S. tristichus embryos exposed to hypoxia succumb to
reduced temperatures. Thus, constraints on oxygen supply during early-life
stages can limit the thermal niches of terrestrial species.

2. Material and methods
(a) Lizard collection and general husbandry
Gravid females (N ¼ 8) were collected from Navajo County, AZ
(34.207786, 2110.101056, elevation  1000 m) and transported to
Arizona State University. Lizards were housed individually in
plastic terraria (35  20  20 cm) with a 12 L : 12 D cycle. Ambi-
ent temperature was 338C during photophase and 208C during
scotophase. Water was available at all times, and four to five
crickets were offered as food daily. Females oviposited between
16 and 23 June 2014.
Prior to measures of thermal tolerance, embryos developed
under normoxic conditions. Eggs were assigned to plastic con-
tainers (12.7  12.7  12.7 cm) in groups of four, with the
constraint that only one egg per mother was assigned per con-
tainer. Containers held 400 g of sand mixed with 4 g of water;
this mixture yields a water potential of 210 kPa [11], which
causes eggs to gain water linearly during incubation [12]. We
placed egg containers in an incubator (DR-36VL; Percival Scien-
tific, Perry, IA, USA) programmed to maintain 85% relative
humidity and a diel cycle of temperature that mimics a natural
nest (20.48C to 34.78C, mean ¼ 278C [13]). Containers were
weighed weekly to replace evaporated water.
(b) Experimental protocol
After approximately 30 days (range ¼ 27–34 days) or 45% of the
mean incubation period [11], we randomly selected four eggs
per clutch (N ¼ 32) to measure the effect of atmospheric oxygen
on thermal tolerance. To confirm that these eggs were alive, we
measured cardiac activity with an infrared monitor (Avitronics,
Cornwall, UK). Three eggs without cardiac activity were exclu-
ded. The remaining eggs were transferred to airtight chambers
(Lock&Lock, Anaheim, CA, USA) in a second programmable incu-
bator. Clutch mates were divided evenly among the chambers,
resulting in three or four embryos per chamber. A ROXY-8
oxygen controller (Sable Systems International, Las Vegas, NV,
USA) was used to set the concentration of oxygen in each chamber
(10, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27 and 30%+0.5%).
Eggs were positioned within chambers to maximize contact
with the atmosphere while minimizing evaporative water loss.
Each egg was placed on a moist piece of cotton in a plastic
dish. To maintain high humidity, we placed an open vial with
50 ml of water in each chamber and dispersed an additional
10 ml on the floor of the chambers. Eggs maintained stable
mass during the experiment (paired t-test of egg mass before
versus after: t28 ¼ 0.54, P ¼ 0.59).
On the first day of the experiment, incubation chambers cycled
between 208C and 388C, simulating diel fluctuations in natural nests
[13] and well within the range of tolerable temperatures [14]. On
subsequent days, the temperature cycled in a similar fashion,
except that the maximal temperature increased by 18C d21. We
placed iButton temperature loggers (Maxim Integrated, San Jose,
CA, USA) inside the chambers to confirm these temperatures
(figure 1). After each thermal cycle, cardiac activity was monitored
to establish whether individuals had survived. Prior to returning
embryos to their chambers, egg masses were measured and water
was added to the cotton to offset evaporation. After nine thermal
cycles, all embryos lacked signs of cardiac activity. To verify
death, eggs were placed in their original incubation containers
and observed for several weeks; embryos neither resumed cardiac
activity nor completed development.
(c) Statistical analyses
We compared linear, nonlinear and piecewise models of the
relationship between oxygen concentration and lethal tempera-
ture. These analyses were conducted with the glm (linear and
nonlinear models) or segmented (piecewise model) functions of
the R Statistical Software (v. 3.1.1) [15,16]. For linear and quadratic
models, we used a Gaussian distribution with the identity link
function. For an asymptotic model (lethal temperature / 1/
oxygen concentration), we used a Gaussian distribution with an
inverse link function, which produces the Michaelis–Menton
model [17]. The piecewise model began with a linear fit and
used an iterative approach to locate the most parsimonious
break point (22.2% oxygen). The most likely model was deter-
mined by the Akaike information criterion (AIC). Early in our
analyses, we included egg mass (fixed factor), maternal identity
(random effect) and their interactions with oxygen concentration;
however, these terms were ultimately excluded because they
failed to reduce the AIC.
3. Results and discussion
As predicted by the oxygen-limitation hypothesis, embryos
exposed to lower concentrations of oxygen died at lower
temperatures (figure 2). The asymptotic model was twice as

likely to best describe the relationship between oxygen con-
centration and lethal temperature as the quadratic model
was, and three times more likely than the piecewise or
linear models (table 1). Embryos exposed to normoxia
(21%) survived to temperatures between 428C and 448C.
Lethal temperature fell sharply with exposure to hypoxia,
such that embryos exposed to 10–12% oxygen died between
398C and 418C. By contrast, hyperoxia had a small positive
effect on lethal temperature; all but one embryo exposed to
hyperoxia (23–30%) survived to at least 428C and two
embryos survived to 458C. In previous studies of S. tristichus
at normoxia, every embryo succumbed to temperatures
below 458C (O. Levy, C. D. Smith, D. Kumar, K. Boateng,
M. J. Angilletta 2012–2013, unpublished data). The small
positive effect of hyperoxia was supported by the higher
likelihood

We interpret the strong effect of hypoxia on thermal toler-
ance compared with the weak effect of hyperoxia in two ways.
First, hyperoxia might enable embryos to survive to tempera-
tures that affect proteins or membranes, thus factors other
than oxygen supply limited survival. However, this explanation
seems implausible considering that most enzymes would not
denature at 458C and would regain performance upon cooling
[2,4]. By contrast, the weak effect of hyperoxia makes sense
when interpreted as a product of symmorphosis—the idea
that structural design matches functional demand [18]. If a
species never experiences oxygen concentrations above 21%, it
should lack the cellular machinery to use additional oxygen
(i.e. blood should be fully saturated at normoxia). Consistent
with this interpretation, a previous experiment revealed that
hyperoxia (30%) had no impact on growth and development
in Sceloporus embryos, although hypoxia (8%) slowed growth
and development relative to normoxia [10]. As these embryos
were not exposed to thermal stress, structural changes in
proteins or membranes could not have caused the nonlinear
effect of oxygen supply on growth and development.
By focusing on the embryonic stage, we showed that oxygen
supply can influence the thermal tolerance of terrestrial animals.
Prior work with insects suggested that oxygen supply does not
affect the thermal tolerance of terrestrial animals, potentially
because air contains more oxygen than water [5]. Our study
casts doubt on this simple dichotomy [8] and underscores the
fact that each species’ ability to acquire oxygen depends on its
evolutionary history and developmental stage. Adult insects
respire using efficient tracheal systems [19], but the embryos of
oviparous amniotes possess a relatively poor respiratory
system. These embryos rely on atmospheric oxygen diffusing
across the shell and into the bloodstream of the chorioallantoic
membrane. Adult insects should be less susceptible to hypoxia
than embryonic reptiles, but even insects pass through an
embryonic stage. Therefore, lethal temperatures of most animals
should dependon oxygen supplyat some stage of their life cycle.
This interaction has important implications forecologyand evol-
ution, especially given that climate warming pushes species to
higher elevations with lower oxygen supplies [20].
