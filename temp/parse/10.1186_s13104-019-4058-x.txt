Abstract 
Objective:  This study aimed to clarify the effects of periodic mild heat stimuli on extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis 
of adult human chondrocytes in 3-dimensional pellet culture.
Results:  Human articular chondrocytes were subjected to pellet culture at 37 °C for 3 days. Thereafter, the pellets 
were divided into three groups: 32 °C group which was cultured at 32 °C without heat stimuli, 32 °C + Heat group 
which was cultured at 32 °C and applied periodic heat stimuli, 37 °C group which was cultured at 37 °C. Heat stimuli 
were given by transferring the pellets into a ­CO2 incubator set at 41 °C for 20 min/day, 6 times/week. ECM synthe-
sis ability was evaluated by analyzing the mRNA expressions. Additionally, the collagen and proteoglycan content 
in the pellet was quantified. DNA content was also measured for estimating the cell amount. We found that there 
were no significant differences in the mRNA expression of COL2A1, COL1A1, and ACAN between the 32 °C group 
and 32 °C + Heat group. However, the collagen content per cell and DNA content were significantly lower in the 
32 °C + Heat group compared to other groups. Our results indicate that periodic mild heat stimuli may diminish ECM 
synthesis due to inhibition of collagen production and loss of cells.

Introduction
Articular cartilage (AC) defects caused by factors such 
as trauma lead to pain, malfunction, and eventual onset 
osteoarthritis. Unfortunately, AC cannot regenerate 
spontaneously; therefore, several treatments have been 
developed for AC regeneration, including cell-based ther-
apy [1, 2]. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) 
is one of the promising cell-based therapies for regen-
eration of AC defects [3]. However, ACI still has several 
challenges. Chondrocytes cultured in vitro undergo dedi-
fferentiation, causing fibro-cartilage like remodeling [4]. 
Furthermore, the extracellular matrix (ECM) around the 
implanted chondrocytes needs enough maturation time 
for constructing firm structures to resist load bearing 
and takes a long time (8–12 weeks) to obtain full weight 
bearing capacity [5]. In order to enhance ECM synthesis 
and maturation, microenvironmental factors such as the 
presence of growth factors, scaffolds, oxygen tension, and 
mechanical stimuli have been intensively investigated 
for several decades [6–9]. In addition to these factors, 
we recently proposed the importance of temperature for 
ECM synthesis by chondrocytes [10, 11]. Because the 
temperature within the human knee joint is influenced 
by environmental temperature, the mean temperature 
of the human knee joint is approximately 32 °C, which is 
4–5 °C lower than the inner body temperature [12, 13]. 
We reported that culture temperatures affected ECM 
synthesis of chondrocytes in a three-dimensional (3-D) 
pellet culture system using adult human chondrocytes 
[11], and found that a culture temperature of 37 °C was 
superior to that of 32 °C for ECM synthesis. This indi-
cates that temperature modulation could be used as a 
treatment to enhance ECM synthesis and maturation for 
ACI. However, to the best of our knowledge, there have

stimuli on the ECM synthesis of AC in human chon-
drocytes. Here we hypothesized that periodic mild heat 
stimuli enhance ECM synthesis in adult human chon-

chondrocytes in a 3-D pellet culture system.
Main text
Materials and methods
Chondrocyte isolation
Human chondrocytes were isolated from the articular 
cartilage of a femoral head extracted during a bipolar 
hip arthroplasty on an 89-year-old woman using a pre-
viously described method [14]. The Ethics Committee of 
the Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University approved the 
procedure (approval no. 944), and informed consent was 
obtained from the donor. The isolated cells were cultured 
until passage two.
Pellet culture
To provide a 3-D environment and to mimic in  vivo 
ECM synthesis, a pellet culture system was used in this 
study. The expanded chondrocytes were resuspended 
in chondrogenic medium (chondrogenic basal medium 
plus 
ITS + supplement, 
ascorbate, 
dexamethasone, 
l-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, proline, and GA-1000; 
Lonza; Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10 ng/mL 
of recombinant human transforming growth factor-beta 
3 (R&D Systems; Minneapolis, MN). Aliquots of 2.5 × 105 
cells in chondrogenic medium were centrifuged at 250×g 
for 5  min in 15-mL polypropylene conical tubes, and 
then pre-cultured at 37 °C in a ­CO2 incubator for 3 days. 
Throughout the study, “n” indicates the technical repli-
cates of the pellet cultures.
Periodic heat stimuli
The pre-cultured pellets were divided into three groups: 
the 32 °C group which was cultured at 32 °C without heat 
stimuli, 32 °C + Heat group which was cultured at 32 °C 
and applied periodic heat stimuli, and the 37  °C group 
which was cultured at 37  °C as a control. We utilized 
41 °C as a heat stimulus because it is frequently used as 
an effective and safe thermal therapy for patients and ani-
mal experiments. Heat stimuli were given by transferring 
the pellets into a separate ­CO2 incubator set at 41 °C for 
20  min/day, 6 times/week. The temperature transition 
of culture medium in the conical tubes was monitored 
using a digital thermometer (BAT-7001H Thermometer, 
Physitemp Instruments Inc.; Clifton, NJ) and is shown in 
Fig. 1.

back into a ­CO2 incubator set at 32 °C for another 10 min. The temperature within the medium was over 40 °C at 15 min, and immediately dropped 
in 10 min after the heat stimulus. This experiment was repeated 3 times, and values represent the means and standard deviations

mRNA expression related to extracellular matrix in articular 
cartilage
In order to assess the immediate effects of heat stimula-
tion on ECM synthesis, ECM-related mRNA expression 
of AC was evaluated. The pre-cultured pellets at 37 °C 
were transferred into a separate ­CO2 incubator set at 
32 °C for 24 h or kept in a ­CO2 incubator set at 37 °C as 
controls. Thereafter, heat stimulus was applied by trans-
ferring the pellets into a ­CO2 incubator set at 41 °C for 
20 min. After heat stimulation, the pellets were placed 
back into the ­CO2 incubator set at 32 °C. Total mRNA 
was extracted from the heat stimulated and control pel-
lets before and at 1, 6, and 24 h after heat stimulation 
(n = 3 pellets/group condition). The mRNA expres-
sion of heat shock 70 kD protein 1A (HSPA1A), type II 
collagen A1 (COL2A1), type I collagen A1 (COL1A1), 
and aggrecan (ACAN) was assessed by quantitative 
real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reac-
tion (qRT-PCR) as described previously [15]. Further-
more, the accumulated effects of heat stimuli on mRNA 
expression were assessed. The pellets from the three 
groups were harvested and total mRNA was extracted 
on day 7 (n = 3 pellets/group). The mRNA expressions 
were assessed by qRT-PCR. Ribosomal protein L13a 
(RPL13a) and tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 
5-monooxygenase activation protein (YWHAZ) were 
used as reference genes, which are proven to be stable 
under different thermal conditions [15]. The gene-spe-
cific primers are listed in Additional file 1.
Collagen and proteoglycan accumulation
Collagen and proteoglycan accumulation in pellets 
obtained on day 21 was evaluated histologically and 
biochemically. The pellets were subjected to macro-
photography and wet weight measurement (n = 12 pel-
lets/group).The pellets were then used for picrosirius 
red staining to visualize collagen, and for safranin-O 
staining to assess proteoglycan deposition (n = 6 pel-
lets/group). For quantitative comparison, collagen 
and proteoglycan content were measured using the 
hydroxyproline assay [16] for collagen content and the 
1,9-dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) colorimetric 
assay for proteoglycan content (n = 6 pellets/group) 
[17]. In order to estimate the cell amount in the pellet, 
DNA content (n = 6 pellets/group) was measured by 
the Quant-iT™ PicoGreen® assay (Invitrogen Ltd., Pais-
ley, UK) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The 
values of collagen and proteoglycan were normalized to 
DNA content in order to describe the amount of these 
molecules per cell.
Statistical analysis
JMP 11 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used 
for the statistical analyzes. Statistical significance was 
determined by one-way analysis of variance following a 
post-hoc multiple comparison Tukey–Kramer test. The 
observed differences were considered to be significant 
if P < 0.05.
Results
Effects of heat stimulus on mRNA expression related to ECM 
synthesis
The expression of HSP1A was upregulated in 1 h after 
heat stimulation, thus confirming the response to heat 
stimulus (Fig. 2a). However, the expression of COL2A1, 
COL1A1, and ACAN was not changed by the heat stim-
ulus and their expression levels were lower than those 
in pellets cultured at 37 °C (Fig. 2a). There were also no 
significant differences in these mRNA expression levels 
between the 32 °C group and the 32 °C + Heat group on 
day 7, although COL2A1 expression in the 37 °C group 
was significantly higher than that in the 32  °C group 
and the 32 °C + Heat group (Fig. 2b).
Collagen and proteoglycan accumulation
The wet weight of the 37  °C group was signifi-
cantly greater than that of the 32  °C group and the 
32  °C + Heat group; however, there was no signifi-
cant difference between the wet weight of the 32  °C 
group and the 32 °C + Heat group (Fig. 3a). The inten-
sity of picrosirius red staining in the 32  °C + Heat 
group appeared to be low compared with that in other 
groups (Fig. 3b-i). In addition, the 32 °C + Heat group 
showed significantly lower hydroxyproline content per 
cell compared to the 32 °C group and the 37 °C group 
(Fig. 3b-ii). The intensity of safranin-O staining in the 
37  °C group appeared to be higher than that in the 
other groups (Fig. 3c-i). The DMMB colorimetric assay 
showed that the proteoglycan content per cell in the 
37 °C group was highest among the groups and that in 
the 32  °C + Heat group was significantly higher than 
that in the 32 °C group (Fig. 3c-ii). The DNA content in 
the 32 °C + Heat group was significantly lower than that 
in the other groups (Fig. 3d).
Discussion
In this study, we investigated the effect of periodic mild 
heat stimuli on ECM synthesis of AC in pellet cultured 
human chondrocytes. We originally hypothesized that 
periodic mild heat stimulation enhances ECM synthe-
sis; however, our results showed that in our study con-
ditions, it diminished the accumulation of collagen, 
which is a major ECM of AC.

AC consists of three major components: type II 
collagen, aggrecan, and the AC specific cell type, 
chondrocytes [18]. We analyzed the immediate and 
accumulative effects of heat stimuli on the mRNA 
expression of COL2A1 and ACAN as well as COL1A1, 
which is a fibrocartilage marker. Heat stimulus of 41 °C 
for 20  min, which is considered a mild heat stimu-
lus [19], did not affect the expression of these mRNAs 
in pellets cultured at 32  °C, mimicking the in  vivo 
situation, though the mRNA expression of HSPA1A 
was upregulated. Compared with 37  °C, the 32  °C + 
Heat group as well as the 32  °C group showed lower 
mRNA expression of COL2A1, ACAN, and COL1A1, 
consistent with our previous reports [11]. These results 
indicate that there are few effects of periodic mild heat 
stimuli on the expression of these ECM related mRNAs 
in this experimental condition. We performed an addi-
tional experiment to confirm the effects of different

temperature stimulus, and found that there were no 
positive effects of heat stimulus at 41–45 °C for 20 min 
on the expression of ECM-related mRNAs in pellet-cul-
tured chondrocytes (see Additional file 2).
Biochemical assessment of the collagen and proteogly-
can content per cell showed that collagen accumulation 
per cell was diminished in the 32 °C + Heat group. This 
would indicate that collagen synthesis was inhibited at 
the translational or post-translational level, but not at the 
transcription level, because there was no significant dif-
ference in the mRNA expression of COL2A1 and ACAN 
between the 32 °C group and the 32 °C + Heat group. It 
is reported that the triple-helix conformation of collagen 
cannot be formed at around 40 °C [20]. In addition, the 
DNA content in the 32 °C + Heat group was significantly 
lower than that in the other groups, indicating cell loss in 
the 32 °C + Heat group. We previously reported cell loss 
in the pellet culture system with continuous heat stimula-
tion at 41 °C [10, 11], whereas little cell loss was observed 
in a monolayer culture system at the same temperature 
[21]. In our previous study, we mentioned that prolonged 
exposure to heat stimulation may have a negative effect, 
and that periodic heat stimulation may have a positive 
effect on ECM formation. However, the present study 
indicates that mild heat stimuli might diminish collagen 
synthesis and cause cell loss even if applied in a peri-
odic manner. Further studies are necessary to elucidate 
the effect of heat stimuli on ECM synthesis using sev-
eral microenvironmental conditions as well as implanted 
chondrocytes in  vivo before applying heat stimuli for a 
clinical trial of ACI.
Conclusion
Here we investigated the effects of periodic mild heat 
stimuli on ECM synthesis of adult human chondrocytes 
in a 3-D pellet culture system. Our results indicated that 
periodic mild heat stimuli could diminish ECM synthesis 
due to inhibition of the collagen production and loss of

cells. Although application of a heat stimulus to enhance 
chondrocyte ECM synthesis would have potential as a 
method for ACI treatment, there are also associated risks 
as we indicate here. Further research is warranted for its 
practical application.
Limitations
We identified four limitations in this study. First, our 
results were derived by assessing the chondrocytes 
obtained from one patient only. Therefore, our data could 
not be simply generalized, and needs confirmation using 
chondrocytes from a variety of backgrounds including 
age and disease. Second, we could not clarify the effects 
of the duration of heat stimulus. There is a possibility that 
shorter or longer heat stimulation might have a positive 
effect on ECM synthesis. Third, we utilized the pellet 
culture system for mimicking the in vivo condition. We 
considered that this system was suitable for this study 
because it is simple and provides reproducibility as well 
as simulation of regenerative or developmental processes 
of articular cartilage. However, this system could not 
completely simulate the in  vivo environment. We have 
reported that different culture systems such as monolayer 
and pellet culture systems show different responses to 
culture temperature [22]. Similarly, chondrocytes in the 
pellet culture system might respond differently from 
chondrocytes in vivo. We focused on the effects of peri-
odic heat stimuli during AC regeneration such as in ACI 
and utilized the pellet culture system to simplify but 
retain the 3-D culture condition in this study. Fourth, we 
did not measure the actual temperature within the pel-
lets although we measured it in the culture medium. We 
consider that this does not affect our results because the 
synthesized pellets were small (minimum diameter of 
1.4–1.7  mm on day 21) and because the thermal con-
ductivity of water is high. Therefore, we consider that 
the thermal conditions on and in the pellet would show 
a similar transition with the culture medium as described 
in Fig. 1.

pellets were subjected to heat stimulation at 41 °C, 43 °C, or 45 °C for 20 
min in a water bath. A shows the temperature transitions in a conical tube 
immersed in a water bath set at the specific temperature. After the heat 
stimulus, the mRNA expression of COL2A1, ACAN, and HSPA1A was ana-
lyzed at 3, 6, and 24 hours after the stimulus (B, C, and D). The pellets cul-
tured at 32°C were used as controls (n = 3 pellets/time point). The results 
showed that HSPA1A expression was apparently upregulated, indicating 
successful heat stimulus (B). However, the 41°C and 43°C groups showed 
no positive effects on COL2A1 and ACAN expression (C and D). Transient 
upregulation of COL2A1 and ACAN was observed at 6 hours after stimula-
tion in the 45°C group (C and D), but these were downregulated at 24 h 
after the stimulus.
