A full version of this article is available from Crystallography Journals Online.  The title compounds are carbazole derivatives. In all three compounds, the carbazole skeleton is essentially planar. In two of the compounds, a benzo­furan moiety is fused with a carbazole unit. Inter­molecular C—H⋯O hydrogen bonds give rise to   (12) inversion dimers in one compound, and to    (40) ring motifs and    (24) inversion dimers in a second compound. In the crystal of the third compound, C—H⋯O hydrogen bonds link the mol­ecules to form chains running parallel to the  a axis. 

  The three title compounds, C 26 H  19 NO  3 S, (1), C  27 H  20 N  2 O  8 S, (2), and C  30 H  19 NO  3 S, (3), are carbazole derivatives, where (1) and (3) are heterocycle-containing carbazoles with a benzo­furan moiety fused to a carbazole unit. In (2), a di­meth­oxy­nitro­phenyl ring is attached to the carbazole moiety. In the three derivatives, a phenyl­sulfonyl group is attached to the N atom of the carbazole unit. Compound (1) crystallizes with two independent mol­ecules in the asymmetric unit (  A and  B ). The carbazole skeleton in the three compounds is essentially planar. In compound (1), the benzene ring of the phenyl­sulfonyl moiety is almost orthogonal to the carbazole moiety, with dihedral angles of 85.42 (9) and 84.52 (9)° in mol­ecules  A and  B , respectively. The benzene ring of the phenyl­sulfonyl group in compounds (2) and (3) are inclined to the carbazole moiety, making dihedral angles of 70.73 (13) and 81.73 (12)°, respectively. The S atom has a distorted tetra­hedral configuration in all three compounds. In the crystals, C—H⋯O hydrogen bonds give rise to  R  2  2 (12) inversion dimers for compound (1), and to  R  2  2 (24) inversion dimers and  R  4  4 (40) ring motifs for compound (2). The crystal packing in (1) also features C—H⋯π and π–π inter­actions [shortest inter­centroid distance = 3.684 (1) Å], leading to supra­molecular three-dimensional aggregation. In the crystal of compound (2), the combination of the various C—H⋯O hydrogen bonds leads to the formation of a three-dimensional network. In the crystal of compound (3), mol­ecules are linked by C—H⋯O hydrogen bonds, forming chains running parallel to the  a axis, and the chains are linked by C—H⋯π inter­actions, forming corrugated sheets parallel to the  ab plane.

Carbazole derivatives have also been used as luminescent and hole-transporting materials (Dijken et al. , 2004  ▸ ). These compounds are also thermally and phytochemically stable which makes them useful materials for technological applications (Diaz  et al. , 2002  ▸ ). 

 Heterocycle-containing carbazole derivatives are embodied in many natural products (Itoigawa et al. , 2000  ▸ ) and display a broad spectrum of useful biological activities, such as anti­tumour, anti­mitotic and anti­oxidative activities (Prudhomme, 2003  ▸ ; Tachibana  et al. , 2003  ▸ ; Hu  et al. , 2006  ▸ ). A number of benzo-annulated carbazole ring systems containing an aromatic ring fused to the carbazole nucleus are potential candidates for cancer treatment as a result of their DNA inter­calative binding properties. They have been shown to bind to estrogen receptors and exhibit a pronounced anti­tumor activity against leukemia, renal tumor, colon cancer and malignant melanoma tumor cell lines (Pindur & Lemster, 1997  ▸ ).    

 Most heterocycle-containing carbazoles reported in the literature comprise a common heterocyclic ring moiety fused with a carbazole ring system, such as pyridocarbazoles and indolocarbazoles. In this context, we discuss here three carbazole derivatives, two of which have benzo­furan moieties fused with the carbazole unit.

  Structural commentary  The three title compounds C 26 H  19 NO  3 S, (1), C  27 H  20 N  2 O  8 S, (2), and C  30 H  19 NO  3 S, (3), are carbazole derivatives, where (1) and (3) are heterocycle-containing carbazoles with a benzo­furan fused to the carbazole skeleton (Figs. 1  ▸ and 3  ▸ , respectively). In (2), a di­meth­oxy­nitro­phenyl ring is attached to the carbazole moiety (Fig. 2  ▸ ). In the three derivatives, a phenyl­sulfonyl group is attached to the N atom of the carbazole unit. Compound (1) crystallizes with two independent mol­ecules (  A and  B ) in the asymmetric unit, as shown in Fig. 1  ▸ . The carbazole skeleton in the three compounds is essentially planar [maximum deviations of 0.052 (2) Å for atom C12 in mol­ecule  A and 0.080 (2) Å for atom C12′ in mol­ecule  B of (1), −0.034 (2) Å for atom C10 in (2), and −0.042 (4) Å for atom C3 in (3)]. The carbazole benzo­furan fused penta­cyclic unit is almost planar in (1) and (3), with dihedral angles between the benzo­furan and carbazole units being 2.48 (6) and 4.16 (6)° in mol­ecules  A and  B , respectively of (1), and 2.33 (8)° in compound (3). In compound (1), the benzene ring of the phenyl­sulfonyl group is almost orthogonal to the carbazole moiety, with the dihedral angles between their mean planes being 85.42 (9) and 84.52 (9)° in mol­ecules  A and  B , respectively. The benzene ring of the phenyl­sulfonyl group in compounds (2) and (3) are inclined to the carbazole moiety making dihedral angles of 70.73 (12) and 81.73 (12)°, respectively. 

 In all three compounds, there are two intra­molecular C—H⋯O hydrogen bonds, involving the sulfonyl ring O atoms forming two cyclic S (6) motifs (Tables 1  ▸ , 2  ▸ and 3  ▸ ). In compound (2), an O—H⋯O hydrogen bond generates an additional  S (6) ring motif (Table 2  ▸ ). Atom S1 has a distorted tetra­hedral geometry in all three compounds. The widening of angle O2=S1=O1 [119.55 (10) and 119.46 (10)° in mol­ecules  A and  B , respectively, of (1), 119.78 (10)° in (2) and 119.99 (13)° in (3)] and narrowing of angle N—S—C [104.85 (9) and 104.82 (9)° in mol­ecules  A and  B , respectively, of (1), 102.92 (9)° in (2) and 105.79 (12)° in (3)] from the ideal tetra­hedral value are attributed to the Thorpe–Ingold effect (Bassindale, 1984  ▸ ). As a result of the electron-withdrawing character of the phenyl­sulfonyl group, the bond lengths N1—C5 [1.430 (2) and 1.431 (2) Å in mol­ecules  A and  B of (1), 1.429 (3) Å in (2) and 1.432 (4) Å in (3)] and N1—C8 [1.428 (2) and 1.425 (2) Å in mol­ecules  A and  B of (1), 1.414 (2) Å in (2) and 1.432 (3) Å in (3)] in all three compounds are longer than the normal value of 1.355 (14) Å [Cambridge Structural Database (CSD), Version 5.37; last update May 2016,; Groom  et al. , 2016  ▸ ]. 

 In compound (2), the di­meth­oxy­nitro­phenyl ring makes a dihedral angle of 76.63 (8)° with the carbazole moiety. The nitro group in (2) is (+) syn-periplanar to the phenyl ring (atoms C20–C25), as indicated by the values of the torsion angles C24—C25—N2—O6 = 21.4 (3)° and C20—C25—N2—O5 = 19.9 (3)°. The torsion angles C22—C23—O8—C27 = −174.6 (2)° and C23—C22—O7—C26 = 175.9 (2)° indicate that the two meth­oxy substituents at C23 and C22 are almost coplanar with the phenyl ring.

 In compound (3), the phenyl ring attached at C12 is oriented at a dihedral angle of 78.39 (11)° to the carbazole unit.

  Supra­molecular features  In the crystal of compound (1), mol­ecules are linked via C4—H4⋯O2 and C4′—H4′⋯O1′ hydrogen bonds, generating two    (12) inversion dimers (Table 1  ▸ and Fig. 4  ▸ ). The crystal packing also features C—H⋯π (Table 1  ▸ ) and π–π inter­actions leading to supra­molecular three-dimensional aggregation. The π–π inter­actions involve inversion related  A mol­ecules with an inter­centroid distance  Cg 4⋯  Cg 4  i = 3.703 (2) Å [where  Cg 4 is the centroid of ring C7–C12; symmetry code: (i) −  x + 2, −  y + 1, −  z + 1], and inversion related  B mol­ecules, with an inter­centroid distance  Cg 20⋯  Cg 20  ii = 3.684 (2) Å [where  Cg 20 is the centroid of ring C7′–C12′; symmetry code: (ii) −  x + 1, −  y + 1, −  z ]. 

 In the crystal of compound (2), neighbouring mol­ecules are linked by C18—H18⋯O2 iii and C26—H26  C ⋯O4  iv hydrogen bonds forming    (40) ring motifs resulting in the formation of sheets parallel to the  bc plane (Table 2  ▸ and Fig. 5  ▸ ). Mol­ecules are also linked  via C2—H2⋯O5  i hydrogen bonds which form    (24) inversion dimers. These dimers are further crosslinked by C17—H17⋯O8  ii hydrogen bonds (Table 2  ▸ ), forming sheets parallel to plane (    02); as shown in Fig. 6  ▸ . The sum of these inter­actions is the formation of a three-dimensional hydrogen-bonded framework. 

 In the crystal of compound (3), mol­ecules are linked through C2—H2⋯O3 i hydrogen bonds (Table 3  ▸ ), that generate infinite one-dimensional  C (9) chains running parallel to the  a axis (Fig. 7  ▸ ). The chains are further crosslinked by C17—H17⋯  Cg 4  ii and C22—H22⋯  Cg 3  iii inter­actions (Table 3  ▸ ), which results in the formation corrugated sheets parallel to the  ab plane. 

  Database survey  A search of the CSD (Groom et al. , 2016  ▸ ) revealed two closely related structures including the parent compound 7  H -1-benzofuro[2,3-  b ]carbazole (Panchatcharam  et al. , 2011  a  ▸ ). This carbazole–benzo­furan fused penta­cyclic unit crystallizes in the space group  Pca 2  1 . However, compound 7-phenyl­sufonyl-7  H -benzo­furan­[2,3-  b ]carbazole (Panchatcharam  et al. , 2011  b  ▸ ) is the closest analogue to the title compounds (1) and (3), and crystallizes in the space group  P 2  1 /  c . The presence of an ethyl or phenyl substituent attached to the carbazole unit does not cause much variation in the structural parameters. The packing of the title compounds are consolidated by C–H⋯O inter­actions, but the related compounds exhibit only C—H⋯π and π–π inter­actions. 

 A similar search conducted for compound (2) gave 10 hits of compounds having a phenyl ring attached to a 7-phenyl­sulfonyl-7 H -benzo­furan­[2,3-  b ]carbazole skeleton. The closest analogues to compound (2) are 2-(4,5-dimeth­oxy-2-nitro­phen­yl)-4-meth­oxy-3-methyl-9-phenyl­sulfonyl-9  H -carbazole (Narayanan  et al. , 2014  a  ▸ ) and 2-(4,5-dimeth­oxy-2-nitro­phen­yl)-4-meth­oxy-9-phenyl­sufonyl-9  H carbazole-3-carbaldehyde (Narayanan  et al. , 2014  b  ▸ ). Both crystallize in the space group  Pca 2  1 , and differ from compound (2) only in the groups attached to the substituted phenyl ring of the carbazole moiety. 

  Synthesis and crystallization  For the preparation of compound (1), a solution of [1-(phenyl­sulfon­yl)-3-propionyl-1H-indol-2-yl]methyl pivalate (0.1 g, 2.34 mmol), anhydrous SnCl 4 (0.07 g, 2.81 mmol) and benzo­furan (0.033 g, 2.81 mmol) in dry DCE (10 ml) was stirred at room temperature under a nitro­gen atmosphere for 3 h. After the completion of the reaction (monitored by thin-layer chromatography, TLC), it was poured into ice water (100 ml), the organic layer was separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with DCM (2 × 20 ml). The combined extract was washed with water (3 × 50 ml) and dried (Na  2 SO  4 ). Removal of solvent followed by column chromatographic purification (silica gel; hexa­ne–ethyl acetate, 8:2  v /  v ) led to the isolation of compound (1) as a colourless solid (yield 0.064 g, 64%; m.p. 483–485 K). 

 For the preparation of compound (2), to a solution of 4-meth­oxy­carbazole-3-carbaldehydes (0.82 g, 1.5 mmol) in dry DCM (20 ml), 1 M solution of BBr  3 (1.65 ml, 1.65 mmol) in DCM was added at 273 K. After completion of the reaction (monitored by TLC), it was poured into ice water (50 ml) containing HCl (5 ml). The organic layer was separated and the aqueous layer was then extracted with DCM (2 × 10 ml). The combined organic layer was washed water (2 × 30 ml) and dried (Na  2 SO  4 ). Removal of the solvent followed by trituration of the crude product with MeOH (10 ml) gave compound (2) as a pale-yellow solid (yield 0.73 g, 92%; m.p. 467–469 K). 

 For the preparation of compound (3), a solution of [3-benzoyl-1-(phenyl­sulfon­yl)-1 H -indol-2-yl]methyl pivalate (0.1 g, 2.11 mmol), anhydrous SnCl  4 (0.066 g, 2.52 mmol) and benzo­furan (0.03 g, 2.52 mmol) in dry DCE (10 ml) was stirred at room temperature under a nitro­gen atmosphere for 3 h. After the completion of the reaction (monitored by TLC), it was poured into ice water (100 ml), the organic layer was separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with DCM (2 × 20 ml). The combined extract was washed with water (3 × 50 ml) and dried (Na  2 SO  4 ). Removal of solvent followed by column chromatographic purification (silica gel; hexa­ne–ethyl acetate, 8:2  v /  v ) gave compound (3) as a colourless solid (yield 0.07 g, 70%; m.p. 491–493 K). Colourless block-like crystals were obtained by slow evaporation of a solution of (1) and (3) in ethyl acetate. Yellow block-like crystals were obtained by slow evaporation of a solution of (2) in methanol. 

  Refinement  Crystal data, data collection and structure refinement details for compounds (1), (2) and (3) are summarized in Table 4 ▸ . The H atoms were included in calculated positions and treated as riding atoms: O—H = 0.82 Å, C—H = 0.93–0.97 Å, with  U  iso (H)= 1.5  U  eq (hy­droxy O and methyl C) and 1.2  U  eq (C) for other H atoms. The methyl groups were allowed to rotate, but not to tip, to best fit the electron density.

   Special details  Geometry. All esds (except the esd in the dihedral angle between two l.s. planes) are estimated using the full covariance matrix. The cell esds are taken into account individually in the estimation of esds in distances, angles and torsion angles; correlations between esds in cell parameters are only used when they are defined by crystal symmetry. An approximate (isotropic) treatment of cell esds is used for estimating esds involving l.s. planes.



 Refinement. Refinement of F 2 against ALL reflections. The weighted R-factor wR and goodness of fit S are based on F  2 , conventional R-factors R are based on F, with F set to zero for negative F  2 . The threshold expression of F  2 > 2sigma(F  2 ) is used only for calculating R-factors(gt) etc. and is not relevant to the choice of reflections for refinement. R-factors based on F  2 are statistically about twice as large as those based on F, and R- factors based on ALL data will be even larger.
