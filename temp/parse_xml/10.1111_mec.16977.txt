TITLE  front  32  2024  0  Genetic basis of ecologically relevant body shape variation among four genera of cichlid fishes   ABSTRACT  abstract  96  Divergence in body shape is one of the most widespread and repeated patterns of morphological variation in fishes and is associated with habitat specification and swimming mechanics. Such ecological diversification is the first stage of the explosive adaptive radiation of cichlid fishes in the East African Rift Lakes. We use two hybrid crosses of cichlids (Metriaclima sp. Ã Aulonocara sp. and Labidochromis sp. Ã Labeotropheus sp., >975 animals total) to determine the genetic basis of body shape diversification that is similar to benthic-pelagic divergence across fishes. Using a series of both linear and geometric shape measurements, we identify 34 quantitative trait loci (QTL) that underlie various aspects of body shape variation. These QTL are spread throughout the genome, each explain 3.2â8.6% of phenotypic variation, and are largely modular. Further, QTL are distinct both between these two crosses of Lake Malawi cichlids and compared to previously identified QTL for body shape in fishes such as sticklebacks. We find that body shape is controlled by many genes of small effect. In all, we find that convergent body shape phenotypes commonly observed across fish clades are most likely due to distinct genetic and molecular mechanisms.   INTRO  title_1  1353  INTRODUCTION   INTRO  paragraph  1366  Body shape variation is common across all vertebrates and has important consequences for an animalâs ecology, locomotion, thermodynamics, and even speciation. A major axis of this morphological variation is body elongation, which occurs within reptiles, carnivorous mammals, and fishes.   INTRO  paragraph  1655  One of the most widespread and repeated patterns of ecomorphological variation within both marine and freshwater fishes is variation in body shape and fin position, often associated with divergence along the benthic-pelagic axis. This morphological divergence occurs similarly in ancient fish radiations, at the macroevolutionary level, and repeatedly at the microevolutionary level.   INTRO  paragraph  2039  Body shape and fin placement dictates how fishes navigate their ecological niches. For instance, fishes that live in environments with variation in structure and water flow generally have a deeper, more stout body thought to be adaptive for increased maneuverability and body rotation. A deeper caudal peduncle and more posterior placement of the anal and dorsal fins enable fishes to have fast propulsion as they move, change direction, and adjust to varied water flow patterns in their complex habitats. This body variation can be coordinated with changes in head shape, namely a shorter head region. Alternatively, a narrow fusiform body shape is often associated with larger head proportions and is thought to enhance performance of sustained swimming (âcruisingâ) while minimizing drag in open water.   INTRO  paragraph  2849  We examine the genetic basis of body shape variation using a textbook example of adaptive radiation, cichlid fishes. Within cichlids, ecological divergence is critical to their adaptive radiation and occurs repeatedly, independently, and convergently in three expansive radiations in East African Rift Lakes as well as smaller radiations within New World crater lakes. Notably, hybrids among difference cichlid species or even genera can be produced in the lab, enabling quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping of phenotypic variation.   INTRO  paragraph  3383  We therefore capitalized on the genetics and extensive phenotypic variation of cichlids to investigate the genetic basis of body shape divergence, a major axis of fish diversification. First, we determined the genetics of body shape within each cross, using species at varying points along a body shape morphological continuum. This allows us to examine if different aspects of body shape variation have similar or distinct regulatory bases, which has important implications for the evolution of these traits. Then, we compare if the genetic intervals and mechanisms of divergence are similar between the two hybrid crosses. If so, this would indicate a shared molecular control as animals evolve towards distinct body shapes. Second, we assess the genetic architecture of body shape evolution in cichlids. We ask if there are many genetic loci that each contribute small effects, or few regions with large effects that regulate body shape. Body shape variation within stickleback fishes has been attributed to a combination of a few QTL with large effects and many QTL with small effects. Further, QTL for body shape and other morphological features in sticklebacks have been suggested to cluster on certain chromosomes, and these âsupergeneâ regions can influence coordinated changes in phenotype. Finally, we ask if this common and predictable morphological trajectory in fishes has a predictable genetic basis by comparing QTL for body shape across multiple fish species. In other words, we determine if there is parallelism in the genetics of body shape variation to accompany convergent morphologies among fishes. To accomplish these goals, we utilized two hybrid crosses of Lake Malawi cichlids, quantifying a suite of linear and geometric measures of body shape. We use QTL mapping to identify the genetic bases of these traits, which we then compare among traits, between crosses, and to studies in other non-cichlid fishes. Together, these data provide insights into the genetic control of a major ecological and morphological divergence in animals.   METHODS  title_1  5447  MATERIALS AND METHODS   METHODS  title_2  5469  Animals and pedigree   METHODS  paragraph  5490  All animal care was conducted under approved IACUC protocol 14â101-O at North Carolina State University. Four species of Lake Malawi cichlids were used: Aulonocara koningsi, Metriaclima mbenjii, Labidochromis caeruleus, and Labeotropheus trewavasae, hereafter referred to by the genus name. These fish have varied ecological specifications and swimming mechanics. Aulonocara lives within an open, sandy region, away from the complex rocky habitat of the other species used here, and forages by cruising over the open sand. The Labidochromis species studied here lives in and around rocky habitats, but is non-territorial and swims continuously, darting among rocks in search of invertebrate prey. Metriaclima is a generalist rock-dwelling fish that often enters the water column, and Labeotropheus represents a more specialized rock-dwelling morphology and behavior, with animals. Two hybrid crosses of these species were generated. The first cross came from a single Metriaclima female crossed to two Aulonocara males; the inclusion of the second grandsire was inadvertent and resulted from an unexpected fertilization event in these species with external fertilization (see ddRAD-sequencing section for how this was addressed during genotyping). The second cross came from a single Labidochromis female crossed to a single Labeotropheus male. Thus, both crosses feature a fish that dominantly âcruises,â a pelagic swimming tactic, versus a more benthic species. For each cross, a single F1 family was generated and subsequently in-crossed to produce F2 hybrid mapping populations. F2 families were raised in density-controlled aquaria with standardized measured feedings until five months of age for analysis. Fish were anesthetized with buffered 100 mg/L MS-222 for all photographs. Whole fish photographs were taken including a color standard and scale bar under uniform lighting conditions in a lightbox with a mirrorless digital camera (Olympus). The sex of each animal was determined based on gonad dissection and these data were omitted if there was ambiguity in gonad phenotype.   METHODS  title_2  7584  Linear quantification of body shape variation   METHODS  paragraph  7630  We quantified various measures of body shape in 10 individuals of each parental species, 491 Metriaclima Ã Aulonocara hybrids, and 447 Labidochromis Ã Labeotropheus hybrids. From photographs, we calculated a series of linear distances (Figure 1b) using ImageJ software (version 2.1.0), including standard length (snout to posterior end of caudal peduncle), head length (snout to opercle), body depth (anterior insertion of dorsal fin to insertion of pelvic fin), caudal peduncle depth, distance between caudal peduncle and anal fin insertion, length of the anal fin base, distance between anal fin and pelvic fin, and pectoral fin depth. ImageJ lengths in pixels were converted into centimeters using the scale bar included in each picture. Head proportion was calculated by dividing head length by standard length. To remove the effects of allometry on body measures, all measurements were converted into residual data by normalizing to the standard length, using a dataset including both parentals and their hybrids for a single cross. Analyses including linear normalization, ANOVAs, Tukeyâs Honest Significant Difference post-hoc tests, and Pearsonâs correlations were conducted in R (version 3.5.2).   METHODS  title_2  8841  Geometric quantification of body shape variation   METHODS  paragraph  8890  Body shape variation was also quantified using geometric morphometric shape analysis with a common data set for all four parental species, Metriaclima Ã Aulonocara hybrids, and Labidochromis Ã Labeotropheus hybrids. Homologous anatomic landmarks were defined along the body primarily using fin insertion sites as well as head landmarks such as the snout, eye, and opercle (Figure 1a). Coordinate positions of all landmarks were collected from photos using the tpsDig2 software package (version 2.31, http://www.sbmorphometrics.org/). Landmark coordinates were extracted and uploaded into the R package geomorph (version 3.1.3), which was used to conduct Procrustes superimposition of landmarks to remove variation due to size, rotation, and position of landmarks to leave variation only due to shape. The effects of allometry were removed with size correction and multiple regression of shape on standard length, using a data set including all parentals and all hybrids. Slopes of vectors of divergence were compared among pairs of groups using the procD.lm and pairwise functions in geomorph (version 3.1.3) using standard length as a covariate and 9999 permutations per function to calculate p-values among 95% confidence intervals.   METHODS  title_2  10127  ddRAD-sequencing   METHODS  paragraph  10144  Genomic DNA was extracted from caudal fin tissue using DNeasy Blood and Tissue kits (Qiagen). Indexed, double-digestion RADseq libraries were produced as previously described and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq with 100 bp paired end reads (North Carolina State University Genomic Sciences Laboratory core facility). Raw sequencing data were demultiplexed and low-quality reads were excluded using the program process_radtags (Stacks, version 2). The demultiplexed and filtered reads were aligned to the Maylandia zebra UMD2a reference genome using BWA with the mem algorithm. We used the programs pstacks and cstacks (Stacks, version 1) to identify RAD markers in each sample and create a catalogue of RAD markers present in both parents of the cross. The RAD markers of the progeny were subsequently matched against this catalog with the program sstacks (Stacks, version 1). Genotype calls for biallelic markers with alternative alleles between the parents of the cross (aa Ã bb markers) were generated with the program genotypes (Stacks, version 1), requiring a minimum stack depth of 3 in order to export a locus in a particular individual. As mentioned above, in the Metriaclima Ã Aulonocara cross an inadvertent fertilization event led to two grandsires. To mitigate potential genetic variation introduced by this and focus on species-level differences, markers were only used if both Aulonocara sires shared the same homozygous genotype and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was met. Any phenotypic effects of genetic variation from a single grandsire (that is intraspecies variation) is expected to be diluted in this cross and therefore not be identified in the subsequent QTL mapping described below.   METHODS  title_2  11849  Linkage map   METHODS  paragraph  11861  The genetic map was built on the R statistical platform (version 4.0.3) with the package R/qtl (version 1.44â9) and in-house scripts available at https://github.com/kpowder/Biology2022. RAD markers were sorted and binned in linkage groups according to their position in the M. zebra UMD2a reference genome. Markers located in linkage groups with more than 20% of missing data and markers located in unplaced scaffolds with more than 40% of missing data were filtered out from the dataset. A chi-square test was performed with the function geno.table() to detect markers with distorted segregation patterns; markers with a Bonferroni-corrected p-value < 0.01 were removed. The pairwise recombination frequencies among markers were calculated, and an initial map was estimated with the functions est.rf() and est.map(). Markers in linkage groups that did not show evidence of being misplaced were considered to be inflating the map and removed if they increased the size of the map by at least 6 centiMorgans (cM) and their flanking markers were less than 3Mb apart. Markers located in unplaced scaffolds were integrated into a given linkage group if they had recombination frequency values < 0.15 with at least five markers from that linkage group. The remaining markers located in unplaced scaffolds were removed from the map. Markers whose recombination frequency profile did not match their position in the genetic map, likely due to being located in structural variants or misassembled regions of the reference genome, were rearranged manually in order to minimize the number of crossovers. The function calc.errorlod() was used to detect genotyping errors; genotypes with a LOD score â¥ 3 were set as missing data. The map was pruned using a non-overlapping window algorithm that selected the marker in a given 2cM window with the least amount of missing data. The final map was estimated and the maximum likelihood estimate of the genotyping error rate (0.0001) was obtained with the function est.map(). The final genetic map for Metriaclima Ã Aulonocara hybrids included 22 linkage groups, 1267 total markers, 19â127 markers per linkage group, and was 1307.2 cM in total size. The final genetic map for Labidochromis Ã Labeotropheus hybrids included 22 linkage groups, 1180 total markers, 42â81 markers per linkage group, and was 1239.5 cM in total size.   METHODS  title_2  14231  Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis   METHODS  paragraph  14270  QTL mapping used multiple-QTL mapping (MQM) methods. Scripts are described in and available from, follow, and use the R/qtl package (version 1.44â9). The process begins with a liberal scan for unlinked QTL using the onescan function in R/qtl. Putative QTL with a LOD approaching or above 3.0 were used to build a more rigorous statistical model. The MQM method use these putative loci as cofactors during a QTL scan, verified by backward elimination. The inclusion of cofactors in the final model provides more accurate detection of QTL and assessment of their effects. Statistical significance of QTL was assessed using 1000 permutations. For QTL peaks meeting 5% (significance) or 10% (suggestive) level, 95% confidence intervals were determined using Bayes analysis. Scan details such as cofactors used and significance levels are reported in Table S1.   METHODS  paragraph  15128  Markers are named based on contig and nucleotide positions in the M. zebra (zebra mbuna) reference genome, M_zebra_UMD2a assembly. Names, ID numbers, and start/stop positions of candidate genes within QTL intervals were extracted from the NCBI genome data viewer (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/gdv) gene track for M. zebra annotation release 104. If upper and lower limits of the 95% interval were markers that mapped to unplaced scaffolds, the closest marker that mapped to a placed scaffold was used instead. Gene names were compiled from the Database for Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) using NCBI gene ID numbers as a query.   METHODS  title_2  15778  Comparisons with other species   METHODS  paragraph  15809  QTL intervals from other studies on body shape in different cichlid species, sticklebacks, and carp were compiled, selecting for traits that were comparable with those studied here (i.e. similar measures to Figure 1). Orthologous positions in the M. zebra (zebra mbuna) UMD2a genome assembly were identified through manual Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST, https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) to the M. zebra RefSeq genome (UMD2a assembly). For studies that only provided candidate genes within intervals, cDNA sequences were used a query for a BLAST. For studies that included marker information, these regions were used as a query for a BLAST. For comparisons within cichlids, the 100 bp surrounding the nucleotide position of the marker position was used. For previous studies in stickleback or carp, the ~400â600 bp sequence of these markers was obtained from the NCBI Nucleotide database and used as a query. The physical positions in the M. zebra UMD2a genome were converted to genetic distances using the linkage map assembled for the Metriaclima Ã Aulonocara cross. We cross-referenced these regions and verified synteny using pairwise comparisons on the online tool Genomicus (https://www.genomicus.bio.ens.psl.eu). Any regions with unclear orthologs or synteny were removed. Additional details such as traits and source of QTL information from previous studies are included in Table S7.   RESULTS  title_1  17223  RESULTS   RESULTS  title_2  17231  Body shape variation   RESULTS  paragraph  17252  Body shape in the four parental species differs in measures such as body depth and relative head proportions, which are common changes across benthic-pelagic divergence in fishes, though differences were not observed in all measures taken (Figures S1âS2 and Table S2). For both crosses, F2 hybrids are largely intermediate in phenotype to the two parental species, though phenotypic variation in hybrids is increased and can surpass the morphological range of parental species (Figures 2, S1, and S2). Lake Malawi cichlids are best characterized as a âhybrid swarm,â in which a set of standing ancestral polymorphisms are being shuffled in differing combinations among species. Thus, even for shapes with non-significant differences between parental species, QTL mapping can identify genetic loci that underlie shape variation within this clade and genetic combinations that are possible in other species (e.g. see pectoral fin depth for both crosses in Figures 3â4 and Figures S1âS2).   RESULTS  paragraph  18248  Geometric morphometric shape analysis identifies coordinated changes in body shape in the bodies of the four parental species and F2 hybrids from both crosses (Figure 2, Figure S3). Together, the first three principal components describe 64.2% of total shape variation (TSV) (Figure S3). Principal component 1 (PC1, 45.0% TSV) describes coordinated changes in body depth, eye size, placement of the pectoral and pelvic fins, and head proportions (Figure S3); these are all phenotypes associated with benthic-pelagic divergence across fishes. Notably, the four parental species are distinguished along this primary morphological axis (Figure 2), with Aulonocara representing a negative PC1 score, Metriaclima and Labidochromis occupying the middle of the PC1 axis, Labeotropheus species having positive PC1 scores (Figure 2). The parents used in each cross demonstrate significantly different shapes (p-values for pairwise comparisons of Aulonocara versus Metriaclima = 4eâ7, Metriaclima versus Labidochromis = 0.9999, and Labidochromis versus Labeotropheus < 1eâ7) (Figure 2). In other words, the two crosses used represent a divergence in opposite directions along a common continuum of body shape. In all, PC1 segregates parental species (Figure 2b) and encompasses a large amount of total body shape variation (45%). Combined with the fact that parental variation is dominantly parallel to this axis (Figure 2a), these indicate ecological relevance of this single principal component axis of shape.   RESULTS  paragraph  19754  Given that PC1 is biologically and ecologically informative, we focus just on this shape axis for the rest of the manuscript. This approach reduces a multivariate analysis of body shape to a single variate (i.e. just 45% of total shape variation). Therefore, we compared the angle of shape vectors among parental pairs to compare if the direction of multivariate shape (i.e. analysis including all principal components and 100% of total shape variation) was similar in the two crosses. No pair of parental species was significantly different in the vector angle of divergence (p= 0.2383â0.9130, Table S3), suggesting that the direction of their shape divergence is largely parallel and therefore predominantly represented by PC1 score. However, we do note that the Metriaclima Ã Aulonocara F2 hybrids and Labidochromis Ã Labeotropheus F2 hybrids did diverge in the direction of shape variation from each other (p=0.001), though largely not from any of the parental populations (Table S3). One possible reason why these hybrid populations may diverge in multivariate shape while the parental species do not is the degree of transgressive phenotypes in the Metriaclima Ã Aulonocara F2 hybrids. In contrast, the phenotypes of the Labidochromis Ã Labeotropheus F2 hybrids largely fell within the phenotypic range of their parental species (compare range of hybrid phenotypes in Figure 2a, or range of hybrid phenotypes compared to parentals in Figures S1bâd versus Figures S2bâd). We also observed that PC2 (11.6% TSV and describing relative body depth without changes in head proportion, Figure S3) significantly distinguishes the Metriaclima Ã Aulonocara cross parentals (Figure S1c), but not the Labidochromis Ã Labeotropheus parentals. Alternatively, PC3 (7.6% TSV representing head proportion and fin positioning, Figure S3) is distinct between the Labidochromis and Labeotropheus parentals but not between Aulonocara and Metriaclima parentals. The fact that these additional shape axes diverge between the crosses suggests that the primary divergence represented by PC1 is then fine-tuned towards specific ecological and functional optima.   RESULTS  paragraph  21908  Compared to Metriaclima, Aulonocara have significantly longer head proportions and a commensurate decrease in mid-body length as measured by the length between the anal and pelvic fins (Figure S1 and Table S2). In agreement with linear measurements, Aulonocara fishes are significantly associated with a negative PC1 score (Figure 2, Figure S1, and Table S2), which characterizes a body with a larger head, a larger eye, and posterior shifts of the dorsal, pelvic, and pectoral fins (Figure S1, Figure S3, and Table S2).   RESULTS  paragraph  22429  Despite both being rock-dwelling Lake Malawi cichlids that live in sympatry, Labidochromis and Labeotropheus parentals have more significant phenotypic differences than the Aulonocara and Metriaclima species pair (Figure 2 and Table S2). Labeotropheus species are specialized benthic fishes within Lake Malawi, and have significantly shorter head regions, decreased body depth, decreased caudal peduncle depth, decreased anal fin length, and increased length between the caudal peduncle and the anal fin compared to Labidochromis fish (Figure S2 and Table S2). In agreement with these linear measures, Labeotropheus is significantly associated with a positive PC1 score, associated with a narrower body shape, shorter head proportion, and shorter anal fin (Figure S2, Figure S3, Table S2).   RESULTS  title_2  23219  Sexual dimorphism in body shape   RESULTS  paragraph  23251  Differences between males and females, termed sexual dimorphism, are incredibly common across species and often include differences in body size or shape. We therefore assessed differences between sexes in our two hybrid populations. Sex in Lake Malawi cichlids is genetically determined, with a diversity of sex determination loci identified. Within the Labidochromis Ã Labeotropheus cross, sex is not associated with common sex determination loci, and of the 354 animals for which sex was called, 92.9% were male. In the Metriaclima Ã Aulonocara cross, sex is solely determined by a common XY system on LG7, which produces an even one-to-one sex ratio. Thus, we only discuss sexual dimorphism based on 412 Metriaclima Ã Aulonocara hybrids (48.1% male), though see Table S2 for full ANOVA analyses in both crosses.   RESULTS  paragraph  24070  Overall size was the most significant body shape difference between males and females (standard length, Table S2). Within the linear measures of body shape, males had significantly larger head proportions, body depth, and length of the anal fin, which features egg spot pigmentation patterns used during mating (Table S2). This is supported by dimorphism in geometric morphometric shape analyses, with males being associated with a negative PC1 score, including increased body depth and a larger head proportion (Figure S3, Table S2).   RESULTS  title_2  24605  Genetic basis of body shape variation   RESULTS  paragraph  24643  To determine the genetic mechanisms that underlie variation in body shape, we genetically mapped PC1 score representing complex shape changes (Figures 2 and S3) and eight linear measures (Figure 1) to not only identify the genetic origins of each trait, but also compare these across different aspects of body shape. By doing this in both the Metriaclima Ã Aulonocara cross and Labidochromis Ã Labeotropheus cross that represent distinct body shapes withing Lake Malawi cichlids, we could also evaluate if common mechanisms control the evolution of body shape in distinct directions along a continuum of morphological variation (Figure 2).   RESULTS  paragraph  25285  Twenty genetic intervals underlie the quantitative differences in body shape in Metriaclima Ã Aulonocara F2 hybrids. This includes 13 that reach 5% statistical significance at the genome-wide level and 7 that are suggestive, reaching 10% significance levels (Figure 3, Figure S1, Figure S4, Table S1). Each trait has 1â5 genetic intervals that influence phenotypic variation. QTL intervals are spread throughout the genome, with 12 of 22 linkage groups each containing 1â2 loci. QTL regions explain from 3.2â7.6% of the total variation in each trait (Table S1 and Figure S4), meaning that all body shapes analyzed are controlled by many genetic loci, each with a small effect.   RESULTS  paragraph  25969  A total of 13 significant and 1 suggestive QTL were identified in the Labidochromis Ã Labeotropheus F2 hybrids, with 0â4 QTL per trait (Figure 4, Figure S2, Figure S5, Table S1). Like the other cross, QTL are spread throughout the genome, with 10 of 22 linkage groups containing 1â2 QTL each. Phenotypic traits are similarly complex in terms of genetics, with each QTL only accounting for 3.4â8.6% of shape variation (Figure S5). Even for the trait with the most variation explained (body depth in Metriaclima Ã Aulonocara), only 19.3% of total shape variation is explained by the combined effects of 5 QTL (Figure S4, Table S1).   RESULTS  paragraph  26607  QTL between the two crosses are largely non-overlapping both generally and for specific traits (Figures 3â4, Figures S1âS5, Table S1). The linkage groups that contain âhotspotsâ with multiple QTL in one cross are largely absent from QTL in the other cross. For example, LGs 1, 11, 14, 18, and 19 each contain two overlapping QTL in the Metriaclima Ã Aulonocara cross, however none of these LGs have a single QTL in the Labidochromis Ã Labeotropheus cross. Alternately, LGs 4, 12, and 20 each contain two overlapping QTL in Labidochromis Ã Labeotropheus cross, but no QTL in the Metriaclima Ã Aulonocara cross. This lack of common genetic signals is also the case when looking at individual traits. There is only one instance where the same trait maps to the same LG. In both crosses, LG15 contains a QTL for anal fin length (Figures 3â4). However, the 95% confidence intervals do not overlap, residing 23 Mb away from each other (Figures 3â4, Table S1). Thus, two distinct genetic intervals control anal fin length in these crosses, but both happen to occur on the same linkage group.   RESULTS  paragraph  27708  However, there are some overlapping QTL within each cross, indicating that certain genomic intervals may have pleiotropic effects on body shape (Figures 3â4, Table S1). First, two QTL from the Metriaclima Ã Aulonocara cross overlap from 56.3â58.0 cM on LG7, contributing to variation in standard length and head proportion (Figure 3). Notably, both traits are sexually dimorphic (Table S2), and the Y sex determining locus is nearby at 61.4â62.9 cM. Second, QTL for head proportion and the distance between the anal and pelvic fins overlap on LG11 in the Metriaclima Ã Aulonocara cross, residing at 3.2â29.5 cM. This âhotspotâ may be explained by a large, previously-characterized chromosomal inversion on LG11 between Metriaclima sp. genomes and Aulonocara sp. genomes. Finally, two QTL co-localize in the Labidochromis Ã Labeotropheus cross from 29.2â58.8 on LG12. This region underlies phenotypic variation in pectoral fin depth and caudal peduncle depth. This region of LG12 is also notable for a series of structural differences and changes in recombination rates among cichlid species. Thus, interspecific variation in structural features of the genome may account for instances where QTL for disparate traits map to common intervals.   RESULTS  paragraph  28966  Allelic effects on phenotypes have a distinct trend for PC1 score in both crosses (Figures S4âS5, Table S1). Namely, the allele inherited from the parent associated with a more positive PC1 score (Figure 2) increases this trait value in hybrids (1 QTL for Metriaclima Ã Aulonocara and 3 QTL for Labidochromis Ã Labeotropheus (Figures S4âS5, Table S1). However, other than this trait, there are no clear trends when looking at allelic effects on phenotypes in either cross. For example, standard length in the Labidochromis Ã Labeotropheus cross is not significantly different between species, is controlled by 4 QTL, and at all 4 of these loci the derived Labeotropheus allele increases size, through a mixture of additive, overdominant, and underdominant inheritance (Figure S5a).   RESULTS  paragraph  29755  Additional work will be needed to further clarify the molecular mechanisms through which phenotypic variation is generated. While some intervals have relatively few candidate genes (e.g. QTL for body depth on LG14 with only 11 genes), most of our intervals contain hundreds of genes (Tables S4âS5). While it is too early to speculate on the effects of specific candidate genes in these intervals, we looked for overlap between our body QTL and one gene previously implicated in trophic adaptations that commonly co-occur with body shape variation in cichlids. Ptch1 variation produces alternate shapes in the lower jaw that represent a tradeoff between two feeding mechanisms: suction feeding associated with more pelagic species and biting that is common within specialized benthic species. Ptch1 co-localizes with the LG12 QTL hotspot in the Labidochromis Ã Labeotropheus associated with depth of both the pectoral and caudal fins. Though this region is also associated with altered patterns of recombination, this leaves open the possibility that a gene such as ptch1 may have pleiotropic effects on multiple phenotypes associated with cichlid divergence.   RESULTS  title_2  30917  Modularity of body shape variation   RESULTS  paragraph  30952  The presence of genetic intervals linked to multiple phenotypes suggests that a single locus may have pleiotropic effects on multiple aspects of body shape variation. We wished to further address whether body shape variation involves coordinated changes, or if different aspects of body shape may be able to evolve independently. To directly address the relationships among our measured phenotypes, we assessed correlations between all pairs of traits. For both crosses, standard length was positively and strongly associated with linear measures (e.g. r values from 0.846â0.963 in the Metriaclima Ã Aulonocara cross, Table S4). Note that geometric morphometric analysis includes a size correction prior to principal component analysis. After removing the effects of size, residuals for each measure were not strongly correlated with each other (r values from â0.563 to 0.369 with a mean of â0.015 in the Metriaclima Ã Aulonocara cross, and r values from â0.412 to 0.340 with a mean of 0.011 in the Labidochromis Ã Labeotropheus cross) (Table S4). While additional analysis such as examination of morphological integration will be important to further define these patterns of shape co-variation, this lack of correlation among phenotypes suggests that despite some traits having overlapping genetic influences (i.e. QTL), the phenotypic patterns generated are distinct.   DISCUSS  title_1  32334  DISCUSSION   DISCUSS  title_2  32345  Evolution of an ecologically important trait   DISCUSS  paragraph  32390  We sought to understand the genetics of an ecologically important trait, body shape, using multiple hybrid crosses of Lake Malawi cichlids and a series of both linear and geometric shape measurements. We find numerous differences in body shape including body depth, head proportions, caudal peduncle depth, and shifting of fin insertions that are likely to have functional consequences for swimming manuevers. This series of changes in the body plan seen in the cichlids used here mirrors variation commonly seen along the benthic-pelagic axis in fishes. Further, divergence of body shape between sympatric Labidochromis and Labeotropheus emphasize that while these fish encounter similar functional challenges of living in a complex rocky habitat, their distinct trophic niches are key factors driving variation in body shape. Specifically, the insectivore Labidochromis has larger head proportions, increased body depth, a deeper caudal peduncle, a shorter caudal region, and a longer anal fin than the algae-scraping Labeotropheus (Figure S2, Table S2). These adaptations in Labidochromis are similar to fishes that use quick bursts of speed with abrupt shifts in direction, and may reflect an ability of Labidochromis to quickly maneuver and pursue insect prey while Labeotropheus feed by hovering and holding steady within water flows of the lake to graze on algae.   DISCUSS  paragraph  33761  We then used QTL mapping to identify the genetic basis of these differences in body shape. We predicted that the same genetic intervals would influence body shape traits in both crosses, given that these crosses represent different aspects of the same continuum of shape variation (Figure 2). In other words, producing an elongated body shape would be the same regardless of relative starting body shape. Contrary to our prediction, we found that QTL that control body shape variation between the open water Aulonocara and benthic Metriaclima fishes are distinct from those that influence variation between a benthic insectivore like Labidochromis and the benthic specialist Labeotropheus (Figures 3â4, Table S1). This trend occurred for both a series of linear measures of body shape as well as for a measure of coordinated changes in body shape (Figure 1). However, it is possible that the identification of QTL was limited by our analytical approach. Specifically, PC1 score represented a large degree of total variation in body shape among the nearly 1000 animals measured (Figure 2) and parental species did not vary in their direction of shape variation in a multivariate analysis of body shape (Table S3). Nonetheless, we may not have identified overlapping QTL for body shape (Figures 3â4) as we limited our genetic mapping to univariate measures of shape (i.e. PC1 score or linear measures) and the two hybrid populations did significantly vary in the direction of shape variation when accounting for multivariate measures of shape (Table S3). Despite these limitations, the lack of overlapping QTL coupled with the modest effects of each QTL (3.2â8.6% variation explained per loci, Table S1 and Figures S4âS5) emphasize that body shape is a complex, polygenic trait and similar morphologies can be produced by multiple mechanisms (a many-to-one relationship).   DISCUSS  title_2  35639  Distinct genetic signals regulate body shape across fishes   DISCUSS  paragraph  35698  Body elongation in fishes along the benthic-pelagic axis occurs repeatedly and widely across fish phylogeny, independent of time (modern versus historic) and environment (marine versus freshwater). In âreplaying lifeâs tapeâ, it is clear that fishes have converged on similar body shapes based on ecological selection. However, it is unknown if fish species use similar genetic mechanisms to achieve these predictable morphologies. Towards this goal, we compared the QTL in this study with QTL identified in additional Lake Malawi species, crater cichlids from Central America, parallel radiations of sticklebacks, and carp (Figure 5, Table S7). This comes with caveats such as missing data due to unclear orthologous regions in the M. zebra genome used here, the inclusion of only some fish species, and similar, yet not identical measures in other studies. Despite this, our comparative approach can still identify if these parallel divergences in body shape could share common genetic mechanisms across multiple fish clades.   DISCUSS  paragraph  36732  Overall, we find relatively minimal overlaps in QTL from our study and previous analysis of body shape in other fishes (Figures 3â5). For instance, regions that have multiple QTL in this work (e.g. LGs 1 and 19 for the Metriaclima Ã Aulonocara cross or LGs 4 and 20 for the Labidochromis Ã Labeotropheus cross) have not been identified in previous analyses. However, there are two instances where there is an overlap in QTL from this study and previous studies, which also describe similar traits. The first is on LG7, where a QTL for head proportion in Metriaclima Ã Aulonocara overlaps with a QTL for head length in carp from 52.27â58.01 cM (Figure 3 and 5). A second overlap occurs on LG10, which has been associated with QTL in three of the previous seven studies (Figure 5). One of these overlap with a QTL from this study, for PC1 shape in the Labidochromis Ã Labeotropheus cross. Interestingly, 9.16â13.41 cM on LG10 is associated with body depth in other Lake Malawi cichlids, and PC1 shape in our work also describes differences in relative body depth (Figures 2 and S3). While this small number of overlapping intervals may identify common genetic intervals that regulate body shape in multiple species, we largely find that evolution of similar body shapes is due to divergent genetic mechanisms, both within cichlids and across fishes.   DISCUSS  title_2  38090  Impacts of evolutionary history on genetic architecture and modularity   DISCUSS  paragraph  38161  Most body shape variation in stickleback fish is caused by few genes with large effects (10â20% variation explained each) and clustered âsupergeneâ regions that influence multiple phenotypes associated with benthic ecologies. In contrast to this, we find that body shape variation in Lake Malawi cichlids is due to many genes, each with a small effect (Figures S4âS5, Table S1 and Tables S5â6). Additionally, we find that QTL are largely spread throughout the genome (Figures 3â4), and there are minimal correlations between measurements (Table S4). The largely modular basis of body shape variation in cichlids has implications for evolutionary potential (i.e. evolvability) and phenotypic variation. Namely, as distinct phenotypes are largely controlled by discrete genetic intervals in cichlids, this allows independent evolution of distinct morphologies, each of which could be subject to different patterns of selection.   DISCUSS  paragraph  39099  While most of the genetic correlations identified show independent segregation and phenotypic impacts, there are exceptions. One is found at the sex determination locus on LG7 in the Metriaclima Ã Aulonocara cross, where the multiple traits mapped to this region are also sexually dimorphic. Our study is unable to disentangle whether the LG7 associated trait variation is sex limited (i.e. modulated by sex-specific physiology during development, where sex is correlated to LG7 genotype), or results from allelic variation that is in linkage with the sex determination locus. If future studies indicate the latter, this would support the hypothesis that sexual dimorphism in body morphology evolves from accumulation of sexually antagonistic alleles at sex determination loci, as has been suggested for sexual dimorphism in pigmentation. Two other hotspots containing multiple trait QTL include LG11 in the Metriaclima Ã Aulonocara cross and LG12 in the Labidochromis Ã Labeotropheus cross. There is clear evidence for an interspecific inversion at LG11 between Metriaclima and Aulonocara, and recombination patterns among different hybrid crosses suggest that LG12 has significant variation in structure among Lake Malawi cichlids. Inversions and other structural variants can strongly suppress recombination, and this could support the evolutionary accumulation of complimentary adaptive alleles at multiple loci within broad haplotypes. Similar roles for inversions have been suggested in the parallel adaptation of sticklebacks, including the predictable fixation of certain inversion haplotypes within freshwater populations. Within the Lake Malawi radiation, where occasional interspecific hybridization occurs and likely supports evolution, inversions may preserve combinations of alleles that drive multiple, distinct traits in the same direction along body shape ecomorphological axis, while avoiding discordant phenotypes. Our observations indicate a need for additional work dissecting genetic variation at structural variants. This could determine whether multiple genes are involved, or whether the hotspots represent the pleiotropic effects of a single gene that happens to lie within a structural variant.   DISCUSS  paragraph  41324  This different genetic architecture and pattern of genetic modularity within stickleback and cichlid fishes is likely due to their different evolutionary histories and ancestral states. Specifically, ancestral sticklebacks are marine, pelagic morphs that have a strong selective pressure towards a freshwater, benthic form when migrating into small lakes created by glacial retreat. On the other hand, cichlids evolved from a small group of generalist, riverine species in sympatry towards multiple adaptive peaks. While ecological divergence is an important stage of the cichlid radiation and influences patterns of speciation, this is only one of many selective pressures. Further, the cichlid âhybrid swarmâ has extensive shared genetic variation and ongoing gene flow among fish with varying body shapes, which further influences the genetic architecture, modularity, and evolutionary potential of morphological variation in cichlids.   CONCL  title_1  42267  CONCLUSIONS   CONCL  paragraph  42279  Body elongation is common across animals. In fishes, the benthic-pelagic ecomorphological axis is a major source of phenotypic variation, encompassing a suite of body shape phenotypes. Using cichlid species with body shape variation that parallels the benthic-pelagic axis in other fishes, we show that body shape variation is most likely due to distinct molecular signals in different fish clades or even at different points along a morphological continuum in a single radiation. Through comparison of genetic mapping results in two hybrid crosses, we show here that even the closely related cichlid species examined have distinct genetic architectures for this convergent trait. The genetic loci we identify here additionally serve as candidates to understand the molecular origins of an ecologically relevant trait, body shape variation.

(a) Overall body shape variation including both crosses, represented by principal component scores calculated from geometric morphometric measures. Shapes indicated by PC scores are illustrated in Figure S3. (b) As visualized by Principal component 1 (PC1) scores, the Metriaclima Ã Aulonocara cross and Labidochromis Ã Labeotropheus cross largely represent distinct phenotypes along the primary axis of body shape variation. Inset compares shape at the extremes of the PC1 axis, with negative and positive shape represented by black and gray dots, respectively. This axis describes variation in body depth, head proportion, eye size, and relative fin placement, paralleling benthic-pelagic divergence in fishes. All pairwise comparisons of parental groups are statistically significant different (p < 1.4eâ6) except Metriaclima sp. and Labidochromis sp., which are not significantly different in PC1 scores.
