Background  Despite significant progresses in antimicrobial therapy, infectious diseases caused by bacteria and fungi remain a major worldwide health problem because of the rapid development of resistance to existing antimicrobial drugs. Therefore, there is a constant need for new antimicrobial agents. There are a large number of heterocyclic derivatives containing nitrogen atoms that possess a broad spectrum of biological activities including pyridine and pyridazine, which are two of the most important heterocycles in medicinal chemistry.

  Results  The reaction of 3-oxo-2-arylhydrazonopropanals 2 with ethyl cyanoacetate and malononitrile  3a,b has led to the formation of 2-amino-5-arylazo-6-aryl substituted nicotinates  8a-k as sole isolable products when the aryl group in the arylazo moiety was substituted with an electron-withdrawing group like Cl, Br, NO  2 . The pyridazinones  10 were formed from the same reaction when the arylazo moiety was phenyl or phenyl substituted with an electron-donating group. The 2-aminoazonicotinates  8 were condensed with DMF-DMA to afford the amidines  13a,b , which then were cyclized to afford the targeted pyrido[2,3-  d ]pyrimidine derivatives  15a,b, respectively. The structures of all new substances prepared in this investigation were determined by using X-ray crystallographic analysis and spectroscopic methods. Most of the synthesized compounds were tested and evaluated as antimicrobial agents and the results indicated that many of the obtained compounds exhibited high antimicrobial activity comparable to ampicillin, which was used as the reference compound. 

  Conclusion  A general rule for the synthesis of 2-amino-5-arylazo-6-aryl substituted nicotinic acid and pyridazinone was established using 3-oxo-2-arylhydrazonopropanal as a precursor. Moreover, a novel route to pyrido[2,3- d ]pyrimidine was achieved. Most of the synthesized compounds were found to exhibit strong inhibitory effects on the growth of Gram-positive bacteria especially  Bacillus subtilis . Compounds  1a, 8a-h ,  10a-c ,  15b and  16 showed a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against  B. subtilis . 

   Azonicotinates  Pyridazinones  Pyrido[2,3- d ]pyrimidine   X-ray  Antimicrobial activity     Background  The emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance has become one of the most serious public health concerns across the world. Antimicrobial resistance refers to microorganisms that have developed the ability to inactivate, exclude, or block the inhibitory or lethal effects of antimicrobial agents [ 1 ]. Despite significant progress in antimicrobial therapy, infectious diseases caused by bacteria and fungi remain a major worldwide health problem because of the rapid development of resistance to the existing antimicrobial drugs (antibacterial and antifungal). In other words, the increasing use and misuse of existing antimicrobial drugs have resulted in the development of resistant pathogens. In particular, the emergence of multidrug-resistant Gram-positive and -negative bacteria has caused life-threatening infectious diseases in many countries. The chemical and biological study of heterocyclic compounds has been of interest for many years for medicinal and agricultural reasons. There are a large number of heterocyclic derivatives containing nitrogen atoms such as pyridine and pyridazine that possess a broad spectrum of biological activities including antimicrobial [  2 -  6 ], anti-inflammatory and analgesic [  7 -  9 ], anti-HIV [  10 ], antiplasmodial [  11 ], anti-tubercular [  3 ,  12 ], antibacterial [  3 ,  13 ], anticonvulsant [  14 ,  15 ], inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase [  16 ], antidiabetic [  17 ], antihypertensive [  18 ], anticancer [  19 -  22 ], inhibition of blood platelet aggregation [  23 ], antidepressant and anxiolytic [  24 ,  25 ], antioxidant [  26 ] and antifungal [  27 ]. Thus, the extensive biological activities of pyridine and pyridazine make them important in the design of drug-like molecules. Encouraged by the afore-mentioned findings and in a continuation of an ongoing program aimed at finding new structural leads with potential potent antibacterial and antifungal agents [  28 ,  29 ], this study describes the synthesis of a new class of 2-amino-5-arylazo-6-aryl substituted nicotinic acid, pyridazinone, and pyrido[2,3-  d ]pyrimidine derivatives. 

  Results and discussion  Synthetic chemistry  The reaction of the 3-oxo-2-arylhydrazonopropanals 2 with the active methylene reagents has been investigated in the past [  30 ]. Recently, it was shown that this reaction affords either arylazo-2-oxonicotinates  6 or pyridazinones  10 [  31 ]. However, the factors that control the nature of the end product could not be defined. In the present article, we report the synthesis of several derivatives of  2 with electron-donating and -withdrawing substituents on the arylazo moiety and identified the exact structure of the products of their reaction with the active methylene reagents  3a,b . It could be concluded that the reaction of  3 with  2 having an electron-donating substituent on the arylazo moiety afforded only the pyridazinones  10 while reacting  3 with  2 having an electron-withdrawing substituent on the arylazo moiety either in the  p ,  m, or  o position or a mix of them affords only the 2-amino-5-arylazo-6-aryl substituted nicotinic acid derivatives  8 . Thus compounds  2a-k were prepared  via coupling of  1 with aromatic diazonium salts [  30 ] (cf. Scheme  1 and Figure  1 ). Reacting  2a-g with ethyl cyanoacetate  3a or with malononitrile  3b affords the 2-amino-5-arylazo-6-aryl substituted nicotinates  8a-k as confirmed from accurate mass determination and elemental analyses. Moreover, the structures were also confirmed from the X-ray single crystal structure determination for  8a ,  8b ,  8c , and  8h (cf. Figures  2 ,  3 ,  4 , and  5 , Tables  1 ,  2 , and Scheme  1 ). It is believed that initially the acyclic condensation products  4 were formed and then these cyclize to the pyranimine  5 that reacts with ammonia from the reaction medium to yield the acyclic intermediate  7 that further cyclizes into the final isolable 2-aminonicotinic acid derivatives  8 . Under these conditions, no traces of the arylazo-2-oxonicotinates  6 or 2-hydroxy-5-arylazonicotinates were isolated as reported by Al-Mousawi  et al. [  31 ,  32 ]. On the other hand, the reaction of  2h-k having a phenyl or a phenyl substituted with an electron-donating group on the arylhydrazone moiety with  3a afforded the pyridazinones  10a-d . It is believed that also in this case, the acyclic intermediate  4 was formed and then cyclized  via attack of the arylhydrazone moiety at CN to afford the pyridazine imine intermediate  9 that was hydrolyzed under the reaction conditions to yield the final isolable pyridazinone  10 . The structure of  10 was also supported by both the classical analytical analyses and through the X-ray crystal structure determination for  10a (cf. Figure  6 , Table  3 , and Scheme  1 ). It is believed that the basicity of the hydrazone moiety of  2 controls the nature of the final product as it facilitates the reversible cyclization of the intermediate  4 and at the same time helps to stabilize the cyclized  9, thus allowing the hydrolysis step to proceed to form the pyridazinone  10 . In contrast, cyclization of  4 is highly reversible and a competing cyclization reaction takes place resulting in formation of the pyranimine  5 , which in the presence of ammonium ion led to the formation of the stable aromatic 2-aminonicotinic acid derivatives  8 .

  The obtained arylazoaminonicotinates are interesting precursors for the synthesis of a variety of a novel arylazoheterocycles that may possess interesting biological activities. Reaction of the 2-amino-5-arylazonicotinates 8 with acetic anhydride afforded the mono- and the di-acetylated products  11 and  12, respectively, depending upon the reaction time. The structures of the products  11a and  12 were confirmed by X-ray single crystal determination (cf. Scheme  2 , Figures  7 ,  8 ).

     Moreover, the 2-amino-5-arylazonicotinates 8 reacted with dimethylformamide dimethylacetal (DMF-DMA) to yield the corresponding amidines  13 . The amidines  13a,b reacted with ammonia in refluxing acetic acid to yield the corresponding pyrido[2,3-  d ]pyrimidine derivatives  15a,b . The structures of these products were also confirmed by different spectroscopic analyses as illustrated in the experimental section. Furthermore, fusion of the azonicotinates  8f with thiourea afforded the corresponding pyrido[2,3-  d ]pyrimidine derivatives  16 (cf. Scheme  3 ).

       Antimicrobial activity  The novel chemical compounds synthesized in this study showed promising antimicrobial activities. In general, most of the tested compounds revealed better activity against Gram-positive rather than the Gram-negative bacteria and yeast. The results as depicted in Table 4 show strong activities against Gram-positive bacteria because all of the tested chemicals showed highly positive antimicrobial activities against  B. subtilis with inhibition zones >10 mm. Only the tested chemical  1a displayed strong inhibitory effects on the growth of  Escherichia coli (Gram-negative bacteria),  Bacillus subtilis , and  Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive bacteria), which showed inhibition zones exceeding 10 mm. It also strongly inhibited the growth of  Candida albicans (yeast) while the cycloheximide did not inhibit growth of this yeast. None of the chemicals except  1a inhibited the growth of Gram-negative bacteria or yeast. Moreover compounds  2a ,  2c ,  2d , and  2g had high inhibitory activities against the Gram-positive bacteria  S. aureus. The tested chemicals  8a-h and  10a-c displayed very strong inhibitory effects toward the growth of the Gram-positive bacteria  B. subtilis with inhibition zones exceeding the reference chemotherapeutic ampicillin (cf. Table  4 ). Compounds  8a and  10c were also nearly as active as ampicillin against  B. subtilis (MIC = 12.5 μg/mL). It was found that transformation of the enaminones  1 into the corresponding arylhydrazonals  2 generally decreased the inhibitory effects while transformation of the latter into the corresponding 2-amino-5-arylazo-6-aryl substituted nicotinates  8 or the pyridazinone  10 resulted in inhibition of the growth of only  B. subtilis (Gram-positive bacteria) as revealed by the diameters of their inhibition zones. Conversely, conversion of the 2-aminoazonicotinates derivatives into the corresponding acetyl, diacetyl, or amidine derivatives exemplified by compounds  11 ,  12 , and  13 unfortunately resulted in a decrease in the inhibitory effects but still had inhibition zones >10 mm. Fusing the pyridine ring into the bicyclic pyrido[2,3-  d ]pyrimidine derivatives  15a,b and  16 enhanced the antimicrobial activity because the majority of these compounds were active against only the Gram-positive bacteria  B. subtilis and  S. aureus .

   • Structure activity relationship  • By comparing the experimental biological activity of the compounds reported in this study with their structures, the following structural activity relationship assumptions are postulated.

 ➢ The pyridine or pyridazine moieties are necessary to observe the higher antibacterial activities towards the Gram-positive bacteria B. subtilis . 

 ➢ It is interesting to point out that for the azonicotinates 8 having an electron-withdrawing group in the arylazo moiety in the  para- ,  meta - and  ortho- positions like compounds  8a-e or having two electron-withdrawing groups in the arylazo moiety as in  8f and  8h results in higher antibacterial activity as evidenced by the inhibition zones that were similar (Table  4 ), and from the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values presented in Table  5 . This indicates that high antimicrobial activity may be correlated with the low electron density of the ring systems and the role of an electron-withdrawing group in increasing the antimicrobial potency is similar to the results of Sharma  et al. [  33 ].

   ➢ It is worth mentioning that changing the COOEt group to a CN group as in 8f and  8h has no significant effect on the biological activity. 

 ➢ The presence of a Me or OMe (electron-donating group) in the aryl moiety in position 2 as in the pyridazine 10b,c enhances the biological activity. 

 ➢ Transformation of the azonicotinates 8 to the pyrido[2,3-  d ]pyrimidine derivatives  15a,b and  16 does not significantly affect the biological activity against the Gram-positive bacteria  B. subtilis . 

  Experimental  General  Melting points were recorded on a Griffin melting point apparatus and are reported uncorrected. IR spectra were recorded using KBr disks using a Perkin-Elmer System 2000 FT-IR spectrophotometer. 1 H-NMR (400 MHz) or (600 MHz) and  13 C-NMR (100 MHz) or (150 MHz) spectra were recorded at 25°C in CDCl  3 or DMSO-  d  6  as solvent with TMS as internal standard on a Bruker DPX 400 or 600 super-conducting NMR spectrometer. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm. Mass spectra were measured using a high resolution GC-MS (DFS) thermo spectrometers with EI (70 EV). Microanalyses were performed on a LECO CHNS-932 Elemental Analyzer. Follow up of the reactions and checking homogeneity of the prepared compounds was made by thin layer chromatography (TLC). All single crystal data collections were made either on Rigaku R-AXIS RAPID diffractometer using Mo-Kα radiation (for samples  8a ,  8c ,  8h ,  11a and  12 ) or on Bruker X8 Prospector using Cu- Kα radiation (for compounds  2a ,  2h ,  8b , and  10a ). The data were collected at room temperature. The structure was solved by direct methods and was expanded using Fourier techniques. The non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. In the case of compounds  8a ,  8c ,  8h ,  11a and  12 , all calculations were performed using the Crystal Structure [  34 ] crystallographic software package except for refinement, which was performed using SHELXL-97 [  35 ]. In the case of  2a ,  2h ,  8b , and  10a the structure was solved and refined using the Bruker SHELXTL Software Package (Structure solution program- SHELXS-97 and Refinement program- SHELXL-97) [  35 ] (cf. Additional files  1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6 ,  7 ,  8 ,  9 and Table  6 ). Data were corrected for the absorption effects using the multi-scan method (SADABS). The enaminones  1a,b and the arylhydrazonals  2a-k were prepared according to the literature procedure [  30 ,  31 ].

The yeasts were propagated in Sabouraud dextrose broth (Difco) after incubation for 24 h at 25°C, [  38 ,  39 ] an aliquot of 0.1 ml of each bacterial strain was inoculated and spread on nutrient agar (NA), while 0.1 ml of the yeast was spread on potato dextrose agar (PDA). The inoculated plates were supplied with 100 μl of each of the tested chemicals with a total final concentration of 1 mg ml  -1 . The chemicals were included in 4-mm wells produced by a sterile cork borer. The NA plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h while PDA plates were incubated at 25°C for 48 h. The zones of inhibition around the wells were determined and the average based on three replicas was recorded. Ampicillin and cycloheximide (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) both used as references in the experiment where ampicillin was used as an antibacterial drug, which is known to inhibit prokaryotes organisms while cycloheximide was used as an antifungal drug, which is known to inhibit eukaryotic organisms. The MIC measurement was determined for compounds with inhibition zones >12 mm using a two-fold serial dilution technique [  40 ]. The inhibition zone diameters values cited in Table  4 are attributed to the tested original concentration (1 mg/mL) as a preliminary test and the MIC (μg/mL) values are recorded in Table  5 . 

  MIC measurement  The microdilution susceptibility test in Müllere-Hinton Broth (Difco) and Sabouraud dextrose broth (Difco) at pH 7.4 was used for the determination of the antibacterial and antifungal activities, respectively [ 38 ,  39 ,  41 ]. Stock solutions of the tested compounds, ampicillin and cycloheximide, were prepared in DMSO at a concentration of 1000 μg/mL. Each stock solution was diluted to prepare serial two-fold dilutions at concentrations in the range of 500–3.125 μg/mL. The microorganism suspensions at approximately 10  5 CFU/mL concentrations were inoculated to the corresponding 96-well plates. The sealed microplates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h for antibacterial activity and at 25°C for 48 h for antifungal activity in a humid chamber. At the end of the incubation period, the MIC values were recorded as the lowest concentrations of the substance that will inhibit the visible growth of the microorganisms (had no visible turbidity). Control experiments with DMSO and uninoculated media were run parallel to the tested compounds under the same conditions. 

   Conclusions  In this study, a general rule for the synthesis of 2-amino-5-arylazo-6-aryl substituted nicotinic acids and pyridazinones was established using 3-oxo-2-arylhydrazonopropanals as precursors. Moreover, a novel route to pyrido[2,3- d ]pyrimidine was achieved. The antimicrobial activities of the resulting novel 2-amino-5-arylazonicotinates, pyridazinone, and pyrido[2,3-  d ]pyrimidine derivatives were investigated with the hope of discovering new structure leads that could serve as antibacterial and antifungal agents. The results of the antimicrobial activities revealed that most of these compounds were found to exhibit strong inhibitory effects on the growth of the Gram-positive bacteria especially  B. subtilis . Compounds  1a, 8a-g ,  10a-c ,  15b , and  16 showed considerable antimicrobial activity against  B. subtilis (Gram-positive bacteria). The results of biological evaluations demonstrated that most of these compounds had promising antimicrobial activities against Gram-positive bacteria.
