Background  Wolbachia are the most widely spread endosymbiotic bacteria, present in a wide variety of insects and two families of nematodes. As of now, however, relatively little genomic data has been available. The  Wolbachia symbiont can be parasitic, as described for many arthropod systems, an obligate mutualist, as in filarial nematodes or a combination of both in some organisms. They are currently classified into 16 monophyletic lineage groups (“supergroups”). Although the nature of these symbioses remains largely unknown, expanded  Wolbachia genomic data will contribute to understanding their diverse symbiotic mechanisms and evolution. 

  Results  This report focuses on Wolbachia infections in three pseudoscorpion species infected by two distinct groups of  Wolbachia strains  , based upon multi-locus phylogenies.  Geogarypus minor harbours  w Gmin and  Chthonius ischnocheles harbours  w Cisc, both closely related to supergroup H, while  Atemnus politus harbours  w Apol, a member of a novel supergroup S along with  Wolbachia from the pseudoscorpion  Cordylochernes scorpioides (  w Csco).  Wolbachia supergroup S is most closely related to  Wolbachia supergroups C and F. Using target enrichment by hybridization with  Wolbachia -specific biotinylated probes to capture large fragments of  Wolbachia DNA, we produced two draft genomes of  w Apol. Annotation of  w Apol highlights presence of a biotin operon, which is incomplete in many sequenced  Wolbachia genomes. 

  Conclusions  The present study highlights at least two symbiont acquisition events among pseudoscorpion species. Phylogenomic analysis indicates that the Wolbachia from  Atemnus politus (  w Apol), forms a separate supergroup (“S”) with the  Wolbachia from  Cordylochernes scorpioides (w Csco). Interestingly, the biotin operon, present in  w Apol, appears to have been horizontally transferred multiple times along  Wolbachia evolutionary history. 

   Keywords  Wolbachia   Pseudoscorpion  Symbiosis  Target enrichment  Genomics  Biotin   http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004774  New England Biolabs    -    issue-copyright-statement  © The Author(s) 2020      Background  Wolbachia are endosymbiotic alpha-proteobacteria infecting a broad range of arthropods and nematodes [  1 ,  2 ]. The bacteria of this genus are considered to be the most widely spread symbionts in the animal world, perhaps infecting half of insect species [  3 –  5 ].  Wolbachia are maternally inherited and can induce variable phenotypes in their hosts through mutualism or parasitism [  6 –  9 ].  Wolbachia are genetically diverse, as are the interactions with their hosts [  10 ,  11 ]. Currently, there is a general consensus to classify them in monophyletic lineage groups (“supergroups” A to R).  Wolbachia belonging to supergroups C, D and J exclusively infect filarial nematodes (Onchocercidae) [  12 –  14 ]. Supergroup L exclusively contains plant parasitic nematodes (Pratylenchidae) [  15 ,  16 ]. Supergroup F  Wolbachia is, so far, the only clade composed by some strains infecting arthropods and some infecting filarial nematodes [  17 ,  18 ]. All other described supergroups exclusively infect arthropods [  19 –  23 ]. The proposed supergroup G members [  24 ] and R [  25 ] are now considered to be part of supergroup B [  26 ] and A [  27 ], respectively, and are no longer considered as separate supergroups. 

 In the last few years, the number of published Wolbachia genomes has increased and currently 48 draft and 21 complete genomes of  Wolbachia are available at the NCBI database. However, these data are not a good representation of the entirety of  Wolbachia diversity. Indeed, among the 21 complete genomes, 15 are symbionts of insects belonging to either supergroup A or B (including 7 strains from species of  Drosophila ), 2 are symbionts of insects belonging to other supergroups (F and E) and 4 are symbionts of nematodes (supergroups L, C or D).  Wolbachia has been identified in other arthropods, such as isopods [  28 ,  29 ] and arachnids [  24 ]. Limited genomic data for isopods are available, for example a draft genome of  w Con, infecting  Cylisticus convexus and a draft genome of  w VulC infecting  Armadillidium vulgare [  30 ]. No genomic data is available for arachnid symbionts while several studies identified  Wolbachia in spiders [  24 ,  25 ,  31 ], mites [  20 ] or scorpions [  32 ]. 

 In the current study, we focused on the Wolbachia symbionts of pseudoscorpions. Pseudoscorpions inhabit wooded areas associated with rotting vegetation. Unlike most arthropods, they are viviparous with embryos obtaining nutrients from the maternal reproductive tract [  33 ]. The presence of  Wolbachia was described for the first time in pseudoscorpions in 2005 in  Cordylochernes scorpioides [  34 ]. It has been reported that the endosymbiont is responsible for the “male killing” phenotype in  C. scorpioides , associated with a high rate of spontaneous abortion. 

 We examined the prevalence of Wolbachia infections in pseudoscorpion population samples from an area in Montpellier (France) where three different species of pseudoscorpions were collected and determined to be positive for  Wolbachia infection. The molecular analyses phylogenetically identified two different  Wolbachia groups, of which one strain is divergent from currently accepted  Wolbachia supergroups. We used  Wolbachia DNA enrichment capture [  35 ,  36 ] to ensnare  Wolbachia DNA for genomic sequencing from this  Wolbachia strain,  wApo, infecting  Atemnus politus . 

  Results  Identification and evolution of Pseudoscorpions  In all, 94 pseudoscorpion specimens were collected from an area of Montpellier (France). Sixty specimens were morphologically identified as Atemnus politus (Simon, 1878), 24 specimens belong to the species  Geogarypus minor (Koch, 1873) and 10 specimens belong to the species  Chthonius ischnocheles (Hermann, 1804). The specimen identification is consistent with the analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene marker (  COI ). The COI sequences of the specimens belonging to  Geogarypus minor are identical to each other and to the sequence of  Geogarypus nigrimanus (JN018180 specimen voucher MNHN-JAB62). The species  Geogarypus nigrimanus has been recently synonymized with  Geogarypus minor [  37 ]. Regarding the produced COI sequences of the specimens belonging to  Chthonius ischnocheles species, the specimens IV3–1, Q3–1, IV1–1 and Q4 are between 99.8–100% identical and match the sequence of  Chthonius ischnocheles available at the NCBI database (JN018172 specimen voucher MNHN-JAB62). The existence of cryptic species of  Chthonius ischnocheles has been documented [  38 ] and the specimens IV-J5 and IV-S1 form a paraphyletic group with the other  Chthonius ischnocheles (Fig.  1 ).  Fig. 1  Phylogenetic tree of pseudoscorpions based on the COI (mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I) gene. The total length of datasets is 659 bp. The topology was inferred using Maximum Likelihood (ML) inference using IQTREE [ 39 ]. The Best-fit model calculated using ModelFinder according to BIC index was TVM + R7. Nodes are associated with Bootstrap values based on 1000 replicates, only bootstrap values superior to 70 are indicated 

    

 The COI sequences of the specimens identified as Atemnus politus present more intraspecific variability: calculated pairwise similarities range between 97.7–99.8%. The blastn analysis [  40 ] does not provide identification of strongly similar sequences in databases; indeed no COI sequences from species related to the  Atemnus genus have been deposited in the NCBI database. The most similar COI sequence in the database belongs to  Atemnidae sp. JA-2011 voucher (JN018203), showing only 79.74% similarity. The COI-based phylogeny indicates that all the specimens of  Atemnus politus form a clade which is a sister group of the clade composed of  Paratemnoides sumatranus and  Oratemnus curtus species, both representatives of the  Atemnidae family (Fig.  1 ). The COI analysis shows all specimens of  Chthonius ischnocheles form a sister group of other species belonging to  Chthonius species (  C. tetrachelatus ,  C. dacnodes ) (Fig.  1 ). To date, the only species of pseudoscorpion described as a  Wolbachia host,  Cordylochernes scorpioides , belongs to the Chernetinae and is a sister group to the Atemnidae family (including  Atemnus politus ) (Fig.  1 ). 

  Prevalence of Wolbachia infection   Wolbachia was detected by PCR amplification of  wsp and  gatB markers (see Methods) in the three studied pseudoscorpion species and in accordance with the generally used nomenclature of  Wolbachia strains, we have named these new strains according to their hosts:  w Apol for bacteria infecting  Atemnus politus ,  w Gmin for bacteria infecting  Geogarypus minor and  w Cisc for bacteria infecting  Chthonius ischnocheles . 

 The A. politus specimens have the highest prevalence of  Wolbachia infection with 43.3% positive samples (26 positive of 60 specimens examined). 16.7% of  G. minor individuals appear to be infected (4 positive of 24 specimens examined), while only 10% of the  C. ischnocheles (1 positive of 10 specimens examined) show PCR amplification of the  Wolbachia markers (Table S  1 ). 

  The w Apol draft genome and annotation   Two draft genomes were produced for w Apol  Wolbachia from  Atemnus politus (specimens K5 and K3) using target capture enrichment [  35 ,  36 ]. For Illumina sequencing, an enrichment of 45-fold was observed (0.4% of the reads mapped to the draft genome without enrichment against 18% with) and 50-fold enrichment was observed with PacBio sequencing (0.8% of the reads mapped to the draft genome without enrichment as opposed to 40.9% with). Unfortunately, the amounts of DNA available for the two specimens were low, and thus the samples were processed simultaneously using individual barcoded adaptors (see Methods) and for PacBio sequencing, relatively few total reads were produced (Table  1 ). The hydrid de novo assembly allowed production of two draft genomes. For specimen K5, a 373 contig draft genome of 1,445,964 bp was obtained, with an average G + C content of 35.6% (largest contig, 25,286 bp, N50 = 5741 bp, average sequencing depth of 420X). For specimen K3, a 200 contig draft genome of 1,404,177 bp was obtained, with an average G + C content of 35.49% (largest contig, 40,755 bp, N50 = 10,346 bp, average sequencing depth = 205X) (Table  1 ).

 Among 221 single-copy orthologue genes conserved among proteobacteria (BUSCOs database), 155 are present in the w Apol K5 draft genome and 151 in  w Apol K3, suggesting 70.2 and 69% complete BUSCOs, respectively. This percentage can be used to assess the level of completeness of genomes (see Methods). By comparison, the  Wolbachia from  Drosophila melanogaster, w Mel  , has a higher level of BUSCOs in the current analysis with 180 genes (81.4%) and  Wolbachia from  Pratylenchus penetrans, w Ppe, has a low level with 161 genes (72.9%) (Table S  2 ). The low level of BUSCOs observed for  w Apol suggest that either the  w Apol draft is incomplete or this genome is highly degraded as has been described for  Wolbachia from  Onchocerca ochengi (74.7% complete BUSCOs) [  44 ]. 

 The Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) calculation (see Methods) indicates that the two w Apol drafts have 99% identity and they are most similar to  w Cle with 87% identity (Fig.  2 ). According to the analysis of available complete genomes, strains which are representative of the same supergroup share more than 94% identity; for example, 99% for  w Oo and  w Ov (from supergroup C), 94% for  w Pip and  w Tpre (from supergroup B) or 96% for  w Mel and  w Cau (from supergroup A).

 One thousand seven hundred forty-six coding sequences (CDS) were annotated using RAST from w Apol K5 and 2215 CDS from  w Apol K3. The high number of CDSs might be explained by presence of multiple copies of same genes due to incompleteness of the draft genomes. The two draft genomes contain a low number of transposable elements (55 mobile elements, 16 group II intron-associated genes, 52 ISs for K5; 35 mobile elements, 9 group II intron-associated genes, 36 ISs for K3) compared to other  Wolbachia strains infecting insects (with the exception of  w Tpre), but a high number compared to  Wolbachia infecting filarial nematodes (Table S  3 ). Numerous phage-like genes were observed in the  w Apol K5 draft genome, with 54 CDS (coding sequences) detected on 37 different contigs with 9 annotated as prophage sequences (Table S  4 ). Fewer phage-like genes were detected in the  w Apol K3 draft genome, with 20 CDS detected on 12 different contigs and only one annoted as a prophage sequence (Table S  4 ). The number of phage-like genes is highly variable among the studied  Wolbachia genomes and the number observed in  w Apol is close to  w Mel (with 44 CDS) or  w Cle (with 20 CDS). However, the variability in transposable element and phage numbers observed between the two  w Apol draft genomes suggests that the genome sequences are incomplete. 

 Although the w Apol drafts are likely not complete, functional annotation of genes by KAAS highlights that the biotin pathway is present, while it is absent in most other studied  Wolbachia (Table S  5 ). Only  w Cle (supergroup F),  w Nfla, wNleu (supergroup A),  w Lug,  w Stri and  w VulC (supergroup B) have a complete biotin pathway. Only  bioC is not detected in the  w Apol K5 draft, but the operon is detected on two contigs: the genes bioA and bioD on contig #258 and the genes bioH, bioF and bioB on contig #172 (Fig.  3 a). In all studied  Wolbachia which contain the operon, the bioC gene is present between the  bioD and  bioH genes and the absence might be due to the fragmentation of the  w Apol K5 draft sequence (Fig.  3 a). For the  w Apol K3 draft genome, only one contig (#148) containing  bioH ,  bioF and  bioB was detected. The organization of the biotin operon appears to be conserved between all  Wolbachia genomes which contain the complete pathway (Fig.  3 a). The phylogenies of the biotin genes (containing bioA, bioB, bioH, bioD and bioF) shows that the biotin operon of wApol K5 is most closely related to the operon of wCle (Fig.  3 b).  Fig. 3  Organization and molecular analysis of the biotin operons of Wolbachia .  a Organization of the biotin operon. The operons among the  Wolbachia and four outgroups were identified and then aligned using MAFFT [  46 ].  b Phylogeny of the biotin operon (concatenation of contig containing bioA and bioD with the contig containing bioH, bioF and bioB). The length of datasets is 4603 bp. The topology was inferred using Maximum Likelihood (ML) inference using IQ-TREE [  39 ]. The Best-fit model calculated using ModelFinder according to AIC index was TVM + I + G4. Nodes are associated with Bootstrap values based on 1000 replicates. The  Wolbachia supergroups are indicated by the color: purple for supergroup F; dark blue for supergroup A; orange for supergroup A and green for supergroup S 

    

  Multi-locus phylogenies and phylogenomics  The analysis of Wolbachia in  Geogarypus minor, w Gmin, was more complex. Two genes were sequenced for  w Gmin,  coxA and  ftsZ , and only nested PCR provided clean sequences to enable phylogenetic comparisons. The  Wolbachia phylogeny, based on the two genes, identified two different sub-groups of  Wolbachia in our samples (Fig.  4 a). The  Wolbachia infecting  Chthonius ischnocheles, w Cisc, and  Geogarypus minor ,  w Gmin, group together and appear closely related to supergoup H  Wolbachia infecting  Zootermopsis termite species (  w Zneg and  w Zang). The  Wolbachia from  Atemnus politus, w Apol, and the  Wolbachia from  Cordylochernes scorpioides ,  w Csco, form a clade which is divergent from known supergroups. This clade is a sister group to supergroup C  Wolbachia, which contains the symbiont present in filarial nematodes (  Onchocerca spp. and  Dirofilaria immitis ). The phylogeny based on six genes (16S rDNA,  ftsZ ,  dnaA ,  gatB ,  fbpA and  coxA ) confirms the topology of  w Apol and  w Cisc (  w Gmin and  w Csco not included) (Fig.  4 b). Our analysis shows the same topology for  w Apol sequences from the two draft genomes (K5 and K3) as well as sequences of  w Apol K5 amplified by PCR, confirming that this topology is not an artifact of draft missassembly. In addition, to verify the accuracy of the  Wolbachia presence in  Geogarypus minor , the  coxA gene was sequenced from another specimen (III-J5) derived from an independent DNA extraction, and PCR amplification and the sequences were identical to another specimen III-T3 (accession number MT273088).

 The Wolbachia from  Cordylochernes scorpioides had been previously studied using a set of genes not routinely sequenced for  Wolbachia evolutionary studies (  groEL ,  fabK ,  nuoG ,  NADH dehydrogenase I subunit F ,  aspS ,  gltA ,  coxA ,  ftsZ ,  wsp ,  orpB ,  nuoD , isocitrate dehydrogenase gene, TPR domain-containing protein gene) [  47 ]. We performed a multi-locus phylogeny based on these 13 genes, including  w Csco and sequences isolated from available complete or draft genomes of  Wolbachia , as well as those from the  w Apol produced draft genomes. The observed phylogeny shows that  w Csco and  w Apol cluster together to form a separate clade, a closely related sister group to supergroup C, as observed with the phylogeny based on only two markers (Fig.  4 a). The two pseudoscorpions contain closely related  Wolbachia strains, with 89.3% identity among these 13 genetic markers (Figure S  1 ). 

 Two complete phylogenomic analyses were performed: one including 17 Wolbachia genomes representing 6 different supergroups and one including 38  Wolbachia genomes representing 7 different supergroups and including additional draft genome sequences. Three hundred twenty single-copy orthologues were identified among the 17  Wolbachia genomes, while 166 were identified among the 38  Wolbachia genomes. The Maximum Likelihood phylogeny based on the reduced matrix (17 genomes, 320 orthologues, 89,847 amino-acid sites) (Fig.  5 a) and the one based on the larger matrix (38  Wolbachia , 167 orthologues, 40,488 amino-acid sites) (Fig.  5 b) indicates the  w Apol group does not cluster with any other  Wolbachia group, suggesting it evolved from an independent separate speciation event. We created supplementary phylogenies based on 16S rRNA and  ftsZ and have included numerous  Wolbachia species to be sure that  w Apol and  w Csco are not grouped with previously described  Wolbachia supergroups (Figure S  2 and S  3 ).

 Based upon the phylogenomics analyses, w Apol (supergroup S) is closely related to supergroup C (symbionts within the filarial nematodes  Onchocerca spp. and  Dirofilaria immitis ) and supergroup F (including both filarial and arthropods symbionts). 

   Discussion  Diversity of Wolbachia in pseudoscorpions   This study highlights diversity of Wolbachia harboured by pseudoscorpions. The studied specimens harbouring distinct  Wolbachia represent different families, not closely related, within pseudoscorpions. The small number of pseudoscorpion species studied (3 among 3300 described species) represent only small snapshot of the diversity within this group (3 families among 27 described), suggesting that the heterogeneity of  Wolbachia among pseudoscorpion species may likely be an underestimate. The species  Geogarypus minor , a representative of the Geogarypidae family and the species  Chthonius ischnocheles , a representative of the Chthoniidae family, contain  Wolbachia closely related to each other and related to supergroup H, as represented by termite  Wolbachia . The species  Atemnus politus , as a representative of the Atemnidae family, contains  Wolbachia closely related to the  Wolbachia from the previously described pseudoscorpion  Cordylochernes scorpioides and forms a clade as a sister group to supergroup C (infecting exclusively filarial nematodes) and supergroup F (infecting filarial nematodes and arthropods). Within the evolutionary history of pseudoscorpions, at least two events of horizontal transfers of  Wolbachia infection have apparantly occurred. More detailed, biodiversity analysis of this group will be required to fully detail the evolutionary dynamics of their  Wolbachia . 

  New supergroup S  The Wolbachia harboured by  Atemnus politus (  w Apol) and  Cordylochernes scorpioides (  w Csco) form a clade divergent from those  Wolbachia supergroups previously described (Figure S  2 and S  3 ). The analysis of the  w Apol draft genome using phylogenomic analysis (Fig.  5 ), or ANI value (Fig.  2 ) point out a divergent  Wolbachia supergroup. It is important to distinguish the notion of “supergroup” from the notion of “species” (which remains problematic for bacteria [  48 ]). The “supergroup” naming only describes the different evolutionary lineages (or clades) of  Wolbachia, and their limits remain arbitrary (as far as it being a monophyletic group). 

 In the past, two W olbachia supergroups had been designated and then revised based on further phylogenetic analysis. Supergoup G had been described as a clade of  Wolbachia from spider  Diaea species based on  wsp marker analysis [  49 ]. However, it was later demonstrated that the analysis based upon this marker sequence led to an incorrect conclusion due to recombination events between  Wolbachia from supergroups A and B [  26 ]. In the case of supergroup R, four genes (  ftsZ ,  coxA ,  groEL , and 16S) were analyzed to study  Wolbachia from cave spiders (  Telema spp.) [  25 ]. From among these four genes, only the  groEL marker gave a different topology, excluding these  Wolbachia from supergroup A. Upon reanalysis, the differing topology conclusion appears to be due to a G + C composition bias of the  groEL gene, causing an incorrect phylogenetic analysis when based on nucleotide sequences [  27 ]. Being aware of these, we created supplementary phylogenies based on 16S rRNA and  ftsZ and have included numerous  Wolbachia species to be sure that  w Apol and  w Csco are not grouped with previously described  Wolbachia supergroups (Figure S  2 and S  3 ). 

 To ensure that the draft genomes of w Apol did not create an artificial clade, we further sequenced PCR amplificons from six previously studied marker genes from an independent specimen from the same set of samples as K5 and verified that the data provided the same topology. Based upon this confirmation, we propose that  Wolbachia from  Atemnus politus and  Cordylochernes scorpioides constitute representatives of a new supergroup. To avoid any confusion, we propose not to reuse the previous supergroup R [  27 ] designation and have assigned  Wolbachia from the pseudoscorpion  Atemnus politus and  Cordylochernes scorpioides to a novel supergroup S. 

  w Apol draft genomes and limitation of de novo assembly based on the enrichment method   Two draft genomes, w Apol K3 (1,404,177 bp long) and  w Apol K5 (1,445,964 bp long) were produced, as representatives of supergroup S. These represent an average size for a  Wolbachia genome from arthropods with the smallest complete  Wolbachia genome being the symbiont from  Trichogramma pretiosum (  w Tpre) which is 1,133,809 bp long [  50 ] and the largest being the symbiont from  Folsomia candida (  w Fol) which is 1,801,626 bp long [  11 ]. The genomes of  Wolbachia from filarial nematodes are smaller, between 957,990 bp and 1,080,084 bp [  44 ,  51 ]. However, the two  w Apol draft genomes are fragmented, being in 200 contigs and 373 contigs, respectively. Relatively few PacBio reads were obtained due to limited material. Despite an efficient probe hybridization enrichment, the low DNA input required pooling of barcoded samples. Based upon BUSCO, assessment of genome assembly indicates that the draft genomes  w Apol are probably incomplete. Despite its average size, the percentage of missing single-copy orthologs conserved among proteobacteria and  w Apol (or missing BUSCOs) (around 22% for K3 and 22.6% for K5) is close to the percentage observed for smaller genomes as  w Oo (22.6%; 957,990 bp),  w Ov (23.1; 960,618 bp) or  w Ppe (21.7%; 975,127 bp). Further, the frequency of transposable elements (Group II intron-associated genes, mobile elements and IS) varies between the two drafts and lower than usually observed for  Wolbachia from arthropods (Table S  3 ). In addition, the long repetitive elements in a genome can limit the efficiency of de novo assembly following hybridization capture protocols, as shown with the de novo assembly of  w AlbB (  Wolbachia from  Aedes albopictus ), which contains a large numbers of long repetitive Group II intron-associated genes [  36 ]. 

 Since the first observation in Wolbachia from  Culex pipiens , the presence of WO bacteriophage in  Wolbachia has been well documented [  52 –  55 ]. Not all  Wolbachia genomes have intact prophage regions; only vestiges of prophage DNA were detected in  Wolbachia genomes infecting nematodes belonging to D or L supergoups [  15 ,  44 ,  51 ]. In the two  w Apol draft genomes, we identified several coding sequences annoted as phage-like proteins, such as structural phage proteins (tail, portal phage, capsid genes) (Table S  4 ). Although, the fragmented nature of the draft genomes limits interpretation,  w Apol has clearly been associated with WO bacteriophage, unlike supergroup C  Wolbachia in which no structural phage proteins are found (Table S  4 ) [  44 ]. In addition, the presence of a prophage region appears to be a limitation for de novo genome assembly using the  Wolbachia genome enrichment method, perhaps due to missing probes based upon the original design or the repetitive pattern of this region, a similar observation to that of the  w AlbB genome assembly, which also failed to assemble the WO region [  36 ]. 

  Rare presence of biotin pathway in Wolbachia   Although it is difficult to conclude about the absence of a particular gene because the w Apol draft genomes are likely incomplete, our study highlights the biotin pathway as being more complete in  w Apol than in numerous studied  Wolbachia . Until recently, only  w Cle (  Wolbachia from bedbug  Cimex lectularius ) contains a complete pathway for biotin (vitamin B7) [  56 ]. More recently, a complete pathway for biotin was identified in  w Nfla and  w Nleu (supergroup A) [  57 ], as well as in  w Lug and  w Stri (supergroup B) [  58 ]. Interestingly,  w Cle provisions biotin (but not thiamin), which significantly contributes to the fitness of host bedbug [  56 ]. In planthoppers,  w Lug and  w Stri  Wolbachia appear to increase the fecundity of their hosts, which may be related to a beneficial effect of  Wolbachia -synthesized biotin and riboflavin [  58 ]. It is tempting to speculate that this pathway in  w Apol may also be important in the association between  Wolbachia and its pseudoscorpion hosts. From this analysis, we also identified the complete biotin pathway for  Wolbachia from the isopod  Armadillidium vulgare w VulC genome. The presence of the biotin operon among the  Wolbachia appears rare, but when present, its physical organization appears conserved among them (Fig.  3 ). Phylogenetic analysis of the biotin gene cluster supports the suggestion that the biotin operons were acquired by lateral transfer from endosymbiotic bacteria, such as  Cardinium species, as previously suggested [  57 ,  58 ]. The lack of congruence between the phylogeny of the biotin operons and  Wolbachia phylogeny suggests multiple independent transfers of the operon within  Wolbachia evolutionary history. 

   Conclusion  Our results emphasize the diversity of Wolbachia among the pseudoscorpion family. We identified infection with two different groups of  Wolbachia, suggesting their independent evolutionary inheritance  , likely via host-switching. Horizontal transmission of  Wolbachia among insects has been previously documented [  31 ,  59 ,  60 ] but this is the first time that a group of pseudoscorpions has been similarly analyzed. The  Wolbachia symbiont from  Atemnus politus, w Apol is divergent from previous described supergroups and we propose a novel clade composed of  w Apol and  w Csco, named supergroup S. The multi-locus phylogenies and phylogenomics indicate that the supergroup S is closely related to the supergroup F (which contains  Wolbachia symbionts of arthropods and filarial nematodes) and supergroup C (comprised exclusively  Wolbachia of filarial nematodes). 

 We produced two draft genomes of w Apol, one of 200 contigs (1,404,177 bp; K3) and the second of 373 contigs (1,445,964 bp; K5) using target enrichment capture. The genome sequences remain incomplete due to the low input of DNA, limiting the PacBio long read sequencing and due to the presence of large repetitive motifs and prophage region(s), previously demonstrated to interfere with complete genome assembly based on the  Wolbachia genome capture enrichment. 

 Interestingly, the annotation of the w Apol draft genome contains the biotin pathway, as opposed to its lack in most of other  Wolbachia , while speculative, it might be suggested that  w Apol may provision biotin to their pseudoscorpion hosts, similar to  w Cle in its bedbug host or  w Stri and  w Lug in planthoppers. The nature of the pseudoscorpion-  Wolbachia biology emphasizes the amazing complexity and evolutionary trajectories of these ubiquitous symbionts and provides the background for future comparative studies. 

  Methods  Source of material, DNA extraction and characterization  Specimens were caught in the field using classical soil microfauna recovery methods using a Berlese–Tullgren funnel [ 49 ,  61 ]. The specimens were collected at Montpellier in 2017 (43°37′52.0″N 3°52′04.6″E). 

 DNA from specimens was extracted using the Monarch® Genomic DNA Purification Kit following the recommended protocol for extraction from tissues (New England Biolabs (NEB), USA) with overnight incubation at 56 °C with proteinase K. The quality of the extraction was verified by a PCR amplification of the host COI gene (Table S 6 ). A total of 20 sequences were deposited in the GenBank Data Library: MN923050-MN923069 (Table S  7 ). 

  Detection and molecular characterization of Wolbachia symbionts   The determination of Wolbachia infection in populations was determined by a series of individual specific PCRs (Table S  1 ). The presence of  Wolbachia was initially screened using PCR amplification of the  Wolbachia surface protein (  wsp ) gene. The presence of  Wolbachia was further confirmed using PCR amplification of the  gatB gene for all specimens which tested positive for  wsp amplification or for those giving dubious results, as well as a randomly selected set of specimens which were negative for  wsp amplification. 

 The molecular characterization of Wolbachia was determined by PCR amplification of six genes (16S rDNA gene,  dnaA ,  coxA ,  fbpA ,  gatB and  ftsZ ) as described in Lefoulon et al. [  14 ] (Table S  6 ). For some specimens, nested PCR amplification was necessary to obtain sufficient PCR product. A total of 14 sequences were deposited in the GenBank Data Library: MN931247 to MN931248, MN931689 to MN931700 and MT273088 (Table S  8 ). 

  Next-generation sequencing of Atemnus politus   Atemnus politus specimens (K5 and K3) were collected from the same location, but at different times within the same year (respectively 5 April and 22 February 2017). The extracted DNAs were low (around 350 ng total based on Nanodrop™ quantification Thermo Scientific, USA)) and fragmented (average size around 6000 bp). In order to attain an amount of DNA necessary for the enrichment method, the DNA of the different specimens was individually barcoded and processed simultaneously, using SeqCap® barcoded adaptors (Roche NimbleGen, USA) (Table  1 ). Samples were not pooled to avoid concerns of potential  Wolbachia strain differences. Four different libraries preparations were processed: one Illumina and one PacBio library using DNA enrichment and Illumina and PacBio libraries without enrichment, to determine enrichment efficiency (Table  1 ). The enrichment method has been described by Lefoulon et al. [  36 ] and it is based on the use of biotinylated probes to capture  Wolbachia DNA (probes designed by Roche NimbleGen). 

 For PacBio sequencing (Pacific Biosciences, USA), the Large Enriched Fragment Targeted Sequencing (LEFT-SEQ) method, as previously described, was utilized [ 36 ] without the DNA fragmentation step. The PacBio library without enrichment was produced using the SMRTbell® Express Template Prep Kit 2.0 for Low DNA input, using the barcoded Overhang Adapter Kit- 8B (PacBio). The enriched PacBio library was sequenced using 2 SMRT cells with the PacBio RS II system and the library without enrichment used 1 SMRT cell, all on the PacBio Sequel I system. 

 For Illumina sequencing, a modified protocol was performed, which eliminated the last steps designed for the PacBio library protocol (end repair, ligation of PacBio adaptor and purification) and in which DNA was fragmented using NEBNext® Ultra™ II FS DNA Library Prep Kit (NEB) at 20 °C for 30 min, resulting in DNA fragments with an average size of 350 bp. We used 100 ng of DNA per sample for each capture and used SeqCap barcoded adaptors (Roche Nimblegen) to process simultaneous multiple samples. The Illumina library without enrichment was produced using the NEBNext® Ultra™ II FS DNA Library Prep Kit following the manufacturer’s recommendations (NEB). The enriched Illumina library was sequenced on three independent Ilumina MiSeq runs: one mate-pair 150 bp read and two mate-pair 300 bp reads. The unenriched Illumina library was sequenced with one, single-end, 150 bp NextSeq run. All sequencing was performed at NEB.

  De novo assembly pipeline  Illumina reads were filtered by quality and “cleaned” using the wrapper Trim Galore! ( https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/ ), and then merged with PEAR [  62 ]. PacBio circular consensus sequences (CCS) were generated using SMRT® pipe RS_ReadsOfInsert Protocol (PacBio) with a minimum 3 full passes and minimum predicted accuracy superior at 90. The adaptors were removed by trimming off the first and last 65 bp of the reads, any reads smaller than 20 bp, or reads containing residual adaptor sequences (potential chimeric reads) using seqkt (  github.com/lh3/seqtk ) (analyses were performed with an in-house shell script). 

 A first hybrid de novo assembly was done using Unicycler [ 63 ]. The potential contigs belonging to  Wolbachia were detected by nucleotide similarity using blastn [  40 ] and selected (similarity superior at 80%, bitscore superior at 50). The Illumina reads were mapped against this contig selection using Bowtie2 (with the very sensitive settings) [  64 ] and the PacBio reads using ngmlr (with the PacBio preset settings) [  65 ]. 

 A second hybrid de novo assembly was performed using Unicycler with this new selection of reads. Selection of Wolbachia contigs was performed using blastn a second time (similarity superior at 80%, bitscore superior at 50) and then verified manually. Assembly statistics were calculated using QUAST [  41 ]. 

  Comparative genomic analyses and annotation of w Apol   The comparative genomic analyses described below included analyses of 10 available complete genomes of Wolbachia and 4 draft genomes (Table S  8 ):  w Mel,  Wolbachia from  Drosophila melanogaster (NC_002978),  w Cau,  Wolbachia from  Carposina sasakii (CP041215) and  w Nfla,  Wolbachia from  Nomada flava (LYUW00000000) for supergroup A;  w Pip,  Wolbachia from  Culex quinquefasciatus (NC_010981),  w Tpre,  Wolbachia from  Trichogramma pretiosum (NZ_CM003641),  w Lug,  Wolbachia from  Nilaparvata lugens ,  w Stri (MUIY01000000),  Wolbachia from  Laodelphax striatella (LRUH01000000) and  w VulC,  Wolbachia from  Armadillidium vulgare (ALWU00000000) for supergroup B;  w Ppe,  Wolbachia from  Pratylenchus penetrans for supergroup L (NZ_MJMG01000000);  w Cle,  Wolbachia from  Cimex lectularius for supergroup F (NZ_AP013028);  w Fol  , Wolbachia from  Folsomia candida for supergroup E (NZ_CP015510);  w Bm,  Wolbachia from  Brugia malayi (NC_006833) for supergroup D;  w Ov  Wolbachia from  Onchocerca volvulus (NZ_HG810405) and  w Oo,  Wolbachia from  Onchocerca ochengi (NC_018267) from supergroup C. 

 The Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) between the w Apol draft genomes and available complete genomes of  Wolbachia was performed using the ANI Calculator [  45 ]. The completeness of the draft genome was studied using BUSCO v3 [  43 ]. BUSCO estimates the completeness of genomes analyzing gene content and comparing to selection of near-universal single-copy orthologue genes (here, 221 genes in common among proteobacteria (proteobacteria_odb9)). 

 The processed drafts were analyzed using RAST pipeline [ 42 ]. Transposable elements were identified: insertion sequences (ISs) using ISSAGA [  66 ] and mobile element and group II introns using RAST pipeline. The phage-like proteins were identified using the RAST pipeline. KEGG Orthology (KO) assignment were generated using KAAS (KEGG Automatic Annotation Server [  67 ]. KAAS assigned orthologue genes by blast comparison against KEGG genes database using BBH (bi-directional best hit) method. The same assignment analysis was performed for the  w Apol draft genome, the set of 14 complete or draft genomes and 1 supplementary draft genome:  w Nleu,  Wolbachia from  Nomada eucophthalma (LYUV00000000). The assigned KOs were ordered in 165 different KEGG pathways (Table S  5 ). For the biotin operon, the amino-acid sequences were identified with the KAAS assignments of  w Apol and other studied  Wolbachia genomes and the complete operons were identified using tblastn and then aligned. The nucleotide sequences were aligned using MAFFT [  46 ], concatenated using Seaview [  68 ] and a phylogenetic analysis was performed with Maximum Likelihood inference inference using IQ-TREE [  39 ]. 

  Multi-locus phylogeny and Phylogenomics  Two multi-locus phylogenies were performed. The first phylogeny was based on six markers (16S rDNA, dnaA ,  ftsZ ,  coxA ,  fbpA and  gatB ), classically used for  Wolbachia phylogeny [  14 ,  69 ]. The produced sequences were analyzed with available sequences extracted from 49  Wolbachia complete or draft genomes and the addition of sequences from  Wolbachia from  Zootermopsis angusticollis and  Zootermopsis nevadensis (Table S  8 ). A supplementary analysis was based on 13 markers (  groEL ,  fabK ,  nuoG ,  NADH dehydrogenase I subunit F ,  aspS ,  gltA ,  coxA ,  ftsZ ,  wsp ,  orpB ,  nuoD , isocitrate dehydrogenase gene, TPR domain-containing protein gene) which includes less  Wolbachia strains (because these markers were rarely used for phylogenetic analyses) but included the only  Wolbachia known to infect pseudoscorpions,  Wolbachia from the pseudoscorpion  Cordylochernes scorpioides [  34 ,  47 ]  . This analysis included 14 complete genomes in addition to the  w Apol draft genome and  w Csco  Wolbachia from  Cordylochernes scorpioides (Table S  8 ). 

 For phylogenomic analyses, single-copy orthologue genes among a selection of Wolbachia genomes were identified using Orthofinder [  70 ]. Two types of phylogenomics studies were performed: one included only 15 complete genomes and one included 36 complete or draft genomes (Table S  8 ). Differences in completeness of draft genomes can be variable and have a negative effect on the robustness of the analyses, and thus the two separate analyses were performed. 

 The orthologue sequence alignments were generated by MAFFT [ 46 ]. For the multi-locus phylogenies, a supermatrix of these six alignments was generated using Seaview [  68 ], and for phylogenomics, the supermatrix was produced by Orthofinder (implemented as functionality). For the later, the poorly aligned positions of the produced orthologue genes alignments were eliminated using Gblocks [  71 ]. The phylogenetic analyses were performed with Maximum Likelihood inference using IQ-TREE [  39 ]. The most appropriate model of evolution was evaluated by Modelfinder [  72 ] (implemented as functionality of IQ-TREE). The robustness of each node was evaluated by a bootstrap test (1000 replicates). The phylogenetic trees were edited by FigTree (  https://github.com/rambaut/figtree/ ) and Inkscape (  https://inkscape.org/ ).
