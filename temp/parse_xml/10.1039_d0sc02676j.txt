A hydroxamate-bound cobalt( ii ) complex bearing a tetradentate macrocyclic ligand, [Co  II (TBDAP)(CH  3 C(–NHO)O)]  + (  1 ), is prepared by the reduction of a hydroximatocobalt(  iii ) complex with a biological reductant. Alternatively,  1 is accessible  via a synthetic route for the reaction between the cobalt(  ii ) complex and acetohydroxamic acid in the presence of a base.  1 was isolated and characterized by various physicochemical methods, including UV-vis, IR, ESI-MS, and X-ray crystallography. The hydroxamate transfer reactivity of  1 was examined with a zinc complex, which was followed by UV-vis and ESI-MS. Kinetic and activation parameter data suggest that the hydroxamate transfer reaction occurs  via a bimolecular mechanism, which is also supported by DFT calculations. Moreover,  1 is able to inhibit the activity against a zinc enzyme,  i.e. , matrix metalloproteinase-9. Our overall investigations of the hydroxamate transfer using the synthetic model system provide considerable insight into the final step involved in the inhibition of zinc-containing enzymes.

 Recently, numerous hydroxamate-bound metal complexes have been explored as prodrugs targeting cancer cells. For example, cobalt( iii ) complexes of hydroxamic acids are reported to be potential prodrugs for hypoxia-selective anticancer agents.  22–25  As shown in  Scheme 1 , Hambley and co-workers have provided experimental support for two possible pathways of releasing the hydroxamate group (  i.e. , bio-reduction and endogenous ligand exchange pathways).  22,26  Recent studies on the characterization and reactivity of cobalt(  iii )-hydroximato and -hydroxamato complexes bearing TPA ligands revealed their redox behaviors and ligand exchange reactions.  27,28  Little is known about the molecular-level mechanism of the hydroxamate transfer, which is the final step of inhibiting the activity of zinc-containing enzymes by hydroxamate, however. 

 Scheme 1  Proposed pathways for the release of hydroxamate (HA).      Herein, we report a novel approach to investigate the hydroxamate transfer activity of a hydroxamatocobalt( ii ) complex, [Co  II (TBDAP)(CH  3 C(–NHO)O)]  + (  1 ; TBDAP =  N ,  N -di-  tert -butyl-2,11-diaza[3.3](2,6)-pyridinophane), which is derived from the reduction of [Co  III (TBDAP)(CH  3 C(  <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.0" width="13.200000pt" height="16.000000pt" viewBox="0 0 13.200000 16.000000" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet"><metadata> Created by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019 </metadata><g transform="translate(1.000000,15.000000) scale(0.017500,-0.017500)" fill="currentColor" stroke="none"><path d="M0 440 l0 -40 320 0 320 0 0 40 0 40 -320 0 -320 0 0 -40z M0 280 l0 -40 320 0 320 0 0 40 0 40 -320 0 -320 0 0 -40z"/></g></svg>  NO)O)]  + (  2 ).  29   1 was characterized by X-ray crystallography and multiple spectroscopic methods. To the best of our knowledge,  1 represents a rare example of a structurally characterized cobalt(  ii ) complex bearing an acetohydroxamate ligand that has been prepared by the reaction of a hydroximatocobalt(  iii ) complex with a biological reductant. In this work, we have examined the mechanism of the hydroxamate transfer from  1 towards a zinc complex which is a model of zinc-containing active sites in enzymes.  30  Kinetic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the notion that the hydroxamate transfer occurs through a bimolecular mechanism. Moreover,  1 performs the better inhibitory activity against matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), compared to  2 . 

  Results and discussion  The hydroxamatocobalt( ii ) complex,  1 , was synthesized by reacting 1 equiv. of acetohydroxamic acid in CH  3 CN with a starting Co  II complex, [Co  II (TBDAP)(NO  3 )(H  2 O)]  + , in the presence of 2 equiv. of triethylamine (TEA) under ambient conditions, where the solution color changed from pink to orange. The UV-vis spectrum of  1 in CH  3 CN at 25 °C revealed two characteristic absorption bands at  λ  max = 361 (  ε = 1900 M  −1 cm  −1 ) and 468 nm (  ε = 100 M  −1 cm  −1 ). The electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) spectrum of  1 showed a single signal at mass-to-charge (  m /  z ) ratio of 485.3 (calcd  m /  z 485.2); the mass and isotope distribution pattern correspond to [Co(TBDAP)(CH  3 C(–NHO)O)]  + (Fig. S1  † ). The FT-IR spectrum of  1 revealed the existence of N–H vibrational frequency at 3206 cm  −1 , which also corroborates the hypothesis that acetohydroxamic acid is bound in the form of singly deprotonated monoanionic hydroxamate rather than doubly deprotonated dianionic hydroximate (Fig. S2  † ).  31  The effective magnetic moment of  1 (  μ  eff = 4.41 B.M.) was determined using the  1 H NMR spectroscopy method of Evans in CD  3 CN at 25 °C,  32  suggesting the high spin state (  S = 3/2) of the Co  II ion (see ESI  † ).  1 has a slightly higher effective magnetic moment due to spin–orbit coupling.  33  Thus,  1 is characterized as the cobalt(  ii ) complex with the singly deprotonated hydroxamate ligand. 

 The X-ray crystal structure of 1 reveals a mononuclear acetohydroxamate cobalt complex in a distorted octahedral geometry, in which the hydroxamate group coordinated in a bidentate mode (  Fig. 1 ). The average Co–O bond length (2.034 Å) in  1 is similar to that of the hydroxamatocobalt(  ii ) complex with 6-(Me  2 Ph)  2 TPA ligand (2.038 Å)  34  but is longer than that in  2 (1.856 Å) and other hydroximatocobalt(  iii ) complexes.  24,25,27–29,35   1 is the rare example of a structurally characterized hydroxamatocobalt(  ii ) complex, which would be a reactive species towards inhibition of metalloenzymes. 

 Fig. 1  ORTEP diagram of the hydroxamatocobalt( ii ) complex, [Co  II (TBDAP)(CH  3 C(–NHO)O)]  + (  1 ), with thermal ellipsoids drawn at the 30% probability level. All hydrogen atoms except H1 are omitted for clarity. H1 was found in the Fourier difference map.       It has been proposed that the hydroxamatocobalt( ii ) species is a key intermediate in the inhibition against MMP.  22,23  We investigated the intermolecular transfer of the hydroxamate group from  1 to a zinc complex, [Zn  II (Me  3 -TACN)(NO  3 )]  + (  3 ), which is a model of the active site of MMP (Scheme S1  † ).  30  Upon addition of  3 to  1 , the characteristic absorption band of  1 disappeared (  Fig. 2a ). The hydroxamate transfer from  1 to  3 was confirmed by ESI-MS analysis in the course of the reaction, where the mass peak at  m /  z 485.3 corresponding to  1 vanished with a concomitant appearance of the mass peak at  m /  z 309.2 corresponding to [Zn  II (Me  3 -TACN)(CH  3 C(–NHO)O)]  + (  4 ) (  Fig. 2b ). Many attempts to isolate the product as single crystals have been unsuccessful. The structural information was obtained from an alternative synthetic route: the complex  4 was crystallized from the solution of the reaction mixture of  3 and excess acetohydroxamic acid in the presence of TEA (see ESI and Fig. S3  † ). Although the equilibrium constant (  K  eq = 5.9 × 10  −2 ) of the transfer reaction determined by optical titrations is small (Fig. S4  † ), the reaction readily occurs upon the addition of an excess amount of  3 .

Inset shows the decrease of concentration of  1 with increasing concentration of  3 . (b) ESI-MS spectra obtained for the reaction of  1 (0.25 mM) with  3 (25 mM) before (lower) and after (upper) the reaction. The peaks at  m /  z 309.2 and 485.3 are assigned to [Zn  II (Me  3 -TACN)(CH  3 C(–NHO)O)]  + (calcd  m /  z 309.1) and [Co  II (TBDAP)(CH  3 C(–NHO)O)]  + (calcd  m /  z 485.2), respectively.       Kinetic studies of the hydroxamate group transfer reaction from 1 to  3 were carried out in a mixture of CH  3 CN and H  2 O (99 : 1). Upon addition of  3 (2.5 mM) to the solution of  1 (0.25 mM) at −10 °C, the characteristic absorption bands of  1 decayed (  Fig. 2 ). The rate constant increased with the concentration of  3 , providing a second-order rate constant (  k  2 ) of 4.0(2) M  −1 s  −1 (  Fig. 3a ). The temperature dependence of the  k  2 value was investigated in the range of 253–283 K, from which a linear Eyring plot was obtained with activation parameters of Δ  H  ‡ = 59(3) kJ mol  −1 and Δ  S  ‡ = −5(1) J mol  −1 K  −1 (  Fig. 3b ). The observed data suggest that the hydroxamate transfer reaction occurs through a bimolecular mechanism, in which the formation of an undetected [(TBDAP)Co–(CH  3 C(–NHO)O)–Zn(Me  3 -TACN)]  3+ species is the rate-determining step.

(b) Eyring plot of ln(  k  2 /  T ) against 1/  T to obtain the activation parameters.       DFT calculations were performed for the hydroxamate transfer reaction (see ESI † ). According to the DFT results (  Fig. 4 ), the oxygen atom in the NHO  − moiety of hydroxamate in the Co(  ii ) complex is first coordinated by the Zn(  ii ) complex at  Int1 . Subsequently, the carbonyl oxygen of hydroxamate is transferred from the Co(  ii ) center to the Zn(  ii ) center  via a transition state (  TS1 ) to form a product complex (  Int3 ). The free energy profile also suggests that the reaction is not a very favorable process thermodynamically, which is reasonably consistent with the small equilibrium constant (  vide supra ).

(b) Optimized geometry of  TS1 , with key distances shown in Å.       On the other hand, upon addition of 3 to a solution of  2 (0.5 mM),  2 remained intact without showing any absorption spectral change (Fig. S5a  † ), indicating that  2 is not able to conduct the hydroxamate group transfer reaction. The ESI-MS spectrum of the reaction solutions confirmed that no transferred product was formed (Fig. S5b  † ). Notably, the transfer reaction occurs by adding a biological reductant such as ascorbic acid, which is a 2H  + /2e  − donor. Addition of 0.5 equiv. of ascorbic acid to a reaction mixture of  2 and  3 resulted in the conversion of  2 to  1 , and then the hydroxamate in  1 was transferred to  3 (Fig. S6a  † ). After the reaction had been completed,  4 was produced, which was confirmed by ESI-MS (Fig. S6b  † ). 

 The cyclic voltammograms of 1 and  2 in CH  3 CN exhibit a reversible couple between the Co(  ii ) and Co(  iii ) complexes (Fig. S7  † ). From the  E  1/2 values, the one-electron redox potentials of  1 and  2 were determined to be 0.28 and −0.47 V (  versus SCE), respectively. The redox potential of  2 is more negative than that of ascorbic acid.  36  In earlier studies, however, the protonation of hydroximatocobalt(  iii ) complexes resulted in more positive potential affording facile reduction.  27  The proton-assisted reduction process was confirmed by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments, where the redox signal of  2 disappeared with the concomitant generation of the redox signal of  1 upon addition of proton (Fig. S8  † ). Alternatively, the hydroxamatocobalt(  iii ) complex, [Co  III (TBDAP)(CH  3 C(–NHO)O)]  2+ (  5 ), which is not only a protonated form of  2 but also an one electron oxidized species of  1 , was prepared by the reaction of  2 with 1 equiv. of HClO  4 (Fig. S11  † ). The formation of  5 was confirmed by UV-vis and ESI-MS (Fig. S12  † ).  2 and  5 are interconvertible through the acid–base chemistry. 

 In order to verify the influence of 1 , relative to acetohydroxamic acid or  2 , on a zinc-containing enzyme, their inhibitory activity against MMP-9 was evaluated. After incubation of activated MMP-9 with a peptide as a substrate in the presence of  1 ,  2 , or acetohydroxamic acid, the amount of the substrate that was not cleaved by the enzyme was analyzed. Inhibition against MMP-9 by  1 and  2 , relative to that by acetohydroxamic acid, was 77(2)% and 24(3)%, respectively. The more noticeable inhibitory activity of  1 than  2 against MMP-9 was expected from our reactivity and mechanistic studies (  vide supra ). 

 To visualize possible interactions between 1 and MMP-9 at the molecular level, docking studies were carried out employing the catalytic domain of MMP-9 (PDB  4H3X ).  37  As illustrated in  Fig. 5 ,  1 could access to the catalytic cleft of MMP-9 where three histidine residues (  i.e. , H226, H230, and H236) are coordinated to the active Zn(  ii ) center. According to the docked structures,  1 may have multiple contacts with the catalytic domain of MMP-9: (i) hydrogen bonding {[C–H from  1 and oxygen (O) donor atoms from A189, A191, E227, and D235; a nitrogen (N) donor atom from H236] and [C–H from H236 and an O donor atom from  1 ]} and (ii) C–H⋯π interaction (C–H from the side chain of L187 and H236 and pyridine groups from  1 ). In addition, the representative conformations exhibited the possibility of the hydroxamate moiety onto  1 to be located close to the Zn(  ii ) center in the catalytic domain of MMP-9. Collectively,  1 may interact with the catalytic site of MMP-9. 

 Fig. 5  Two possible representative conformations of 1 docked with the catalytic domain of MMP-9 (PDB  4H3X ) by AutoDock Vina [surface (left) and cartoon (right) versions]. These conformations exhibited the calculated binding energies in a range from −5.5 to −3.5 kcal mol  −1 . Hydrogen bonding and C–H⋯π interactions within 3.0 Å are indicated with dashed lines. The Zn(  ii ) center in the catalytic domain of MMP-9 is highlighted as an orange sphere.       To explore how the substituent onto the ligand affects the hydroxamate transfer reactivity towards 3 and the inhibitory activity of Co(  ii ) complexes against MMP-9, a benzohydroxamatocobalt(  ii ) complex, [Co  II (TBDAP)(C  6 H  5 C(–NHO)O)]  + (  6 ), was prepared (see ESI  † ). Kinetic studies for the reaction of  6 with  3 were carried out, affording  k  2 of 4.9(5) × 10  −1 M  −1 s  −1 at −10 °C (Fig. S16 and S17  † ). The equilibrium constant for the transfer reaction from  6 was also determined as 4.4 × 10  −2 (Fig. S18  † ). These results are similar to those of the hydroxamate transfer reaction of  1 . Under our experimental conditions, the inhibitory activity of  6 towards MMP-9 was same as that of  1 (data not shown). Thus, replacing a structural moiety of the ligand from acetohydroxamate to benzohydroxamate may not significantly change the hydroxamate transfer reactivity towards  3 and the inhibitory activity of its corresponding Co(  ii ) complex against MMP-9. 

 Based on the experimental and computational studies, it is suggested that the hydroxamate transfer can be accelerated in the presence of a weak acid, which reduces the coordination ability of the hydroxamate group in the hydroxamatocobalt( ii ) complex. Thus, we further investigated the equilibrium between  1 and  4 under acidic conditions. By adding acetic acid to the solution of  1 and  3 , the absorption band of  1 exponentially decreased with increasing concentration of the acetic acid (Fig. S19  † ). This result indicates that, in the presence of acetic acid, the equilibrium is shifted in favor of  4 , which was also confirmed by ESI-MS (Fig. S20  † ). Taken together, the hydroxamate transfer reaction effectively occurs in relatively acidic conditions. 

  Conclusions  We have succeeded in the isolation and structural characterization of a hydroxamatocobalt( ii ) complex bearing macrocyclic tetradentate N4 ligand, [Co  II (TBDAP)(CH  3 C(–NHO)O)]  + (  1 ), in which the acetohydroxamate ligand is bound in a bidentate mode. The intermediate is further characterized by various physicochemical methods such as FT-IR, UV-vis, and ESI-MS.  1 exhibited hydroxamate group transfer reactivity towards a zinc(  ii ) complex. The observation of the hydroxamate transfer between metal complexes is unprecedented. In addition, the proton-assisted reduction mechanism was examined by the CV measurements. Kinetic studies suggest that the transfer reaction proceeds by a bimolecular mechanism, which is supported by DFT calculations. Moreover, the inhibitory activity of  1 towards a zinc-containing enzyme, MMP-9, was confirmed. The interaction and accessibility of  1 to MMP-9 as well as the substitution effect onto the hydroxamate ligand were also examined.
