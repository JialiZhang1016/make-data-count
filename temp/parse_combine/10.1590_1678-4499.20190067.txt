ABSTRACT: A detailed knowledge of the soil water storage variability 
in the root zone can promote recommendations regarding the ideal 
positioning of sensors, as well as make the calculation of soil water 
balance more precise and accurate. This study aimed to assess soil 
water storage variability in the melon root zone and indicate – based 
on spatial variation of soil water storage – the regions of highest root 
activity of the melon crop in different development stages. Soil water 
storage was measured using time domain reflectometry (TDR) in 
40 monitoring points.  The data were daily collected in two periods:

(i) immediately before irrigation and (ii) 30 min after irrigation. The 
soil water storage variation in the melon root zone occurs with greater 
intensity throughout the time of vegetative growth and the highest 
values are always observed in the same distances and depths of 
the soil in all phases of growth. The region indicated as of greatest 
root activity of the melon crop under drip irrigation is delimited, in 
relation to the stem, by the radial distance of 0.36 m and depth of 
0.3 m, for all development stages.
Key words: soil water balance, drip irrigation, irrigation management.

INTRODUCTION
Detailed understanding on the spatial-temporal variation 
of soil water storage in the root zone of crops can promote 
recommendations, as well as the effective root depth for 
water uptake, promoting accuracy in the irrigation depth 
calculation (Silva et al. 2015; Silva et al. 2018).
Applications of sustainable agricultural methodologies 
must take into consideration the biophysical process of 
water uptake by the crops (Green et al. 2006; Dabach 
et al. 2016). Knowledge about root system distribution can 
serve as a basis to recommend the positioning of sensors 
and application of nutrients (Sant’ana et al. 2012; Lucas 
et al. 2012). Nevertheless, studies reveal that there is not 
always a well-defined relationship between soil water storage 
distribution and root distribution (Silva et al. 2009; Raza 
et al. 2013; Silva et al. 2015).
Some recommendations for sensor positioning and application 
of nutrients based on the knowledge about the effective zones of 
soil water storage variation by plants have been made (Soulis et 
al. 2015; Soulis and Elmaloglou 2016), although these studies 
report that the knowledge about the soil water storage variations 
in the root zones of various crops is still of prime necessity.
Silva et al. (2015) considered the variation of soil water 
storage by the root system of banana trees without disregarding 
the evaporation in their measurements. However, aiming at 
the best accuracy and precision in the measurements, these 
authors monitored moisture variation in four monitoring 
profiles and four depths: 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7 m.
Most studies on water movement towards plant roots 
focus on fruit crops (Coelho et al. 2010; Silva et al. 2015; Silva 
et al. 2018) and annual crops (Zarebanadkouki et al. 2012), 
and only a few studies deal with curcubitaceous vegetable, 
such as melon (Mota et al. 2010).
In this study we investigated the hypothesis that soil 
water storage variability affects soil water balance reliability 
and irrigation management, with the objective of evaluate 
soil water storage variability in the melon root zone; and 
indicate – based on spatial variation of soil water storage – the 
region of highest root activity of the melon crop in different 
development stages.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study was carried out at field at the Federal Institute 
of Education, Science and Technology of Bahia – IF Baiano, 
Campus of Senhor do Bonfim-BA (10º 26’ 44’’ S ; 40° 08’ 55’’ W 
and 532 m alt). A melon orchard was planted on May 3, 2016, 
using “Redondo Gaúcho” melon. In the cultivation area, 21 
drainage lysimeters were installed, with volume of 1.12 m³, length 
of 1.4 m, width of 1 m and depth of 0.8 m. The soil used to fill the 
lysimeter came from the planting area, and some of its physical-
hydraulic characteristics are presented in Table 1.
To induce free drainage, the lysimeters had a 0.1-m-thick layer 
of crushed stone and a 0.1-m-thick layer of washed sand at the 
bottom, as well as perforated PVC pipes to convey the drained 
water to taps at the lowest part of the terrain.
Microirrigation was used in the experiment by installing 
a drip system with KATIF emitters with flow rate of 2.3 L·h-1, 
spaced by 0.65 m between the emitters and 2.7 m between the 
lines, using one dripper per plant. After configuration of the 
irrigation system, the test of water distribution and uniformity was 
performed following the methodology proposed by Cristiansen 
(1942), which showed a mean distribution uniformity of 95%.
Soil water content was monitored inside a lysimeter located in 
the center of the melon orchard. The lysimeter area was selected 
to avoid the advection effects suffered by border plants. Soil water 
content data were collected using Time Domain Reflectometry 
(TDR100), connected to a CR 800 data logger (Campbell Scientific 
Inc.). A program was written in BASIC language for reading and 
storage of dielectric constant (ka) values obtained in the 40 TDR 
probes installed inside the lysimeter. The data were daily collected, 
in the morning, at two periods: (i) immediately before irrigation; 
and (ii) 30 min after irrigation. The TDR probes were built at the 
laboratory with the following characteristics: three stainless-steel 
rods with diameter of 0.003 m, effective length of 0.1 m outside the 
resin and spaced by 0.017 m; 50-ohm coaxial cables; 0.05-m-long 
layer of polyester resin at the beginning of the rods.
The calibration equation of the probes was obtained 
based on the adjustment of the apparent (ka measured by 
TDR in relation to the soil water content (θ). For this, soil 
sample was collected in the experimental area. The soil was 
air-dried, sieved (2-mm screen) and stored in a PVC pipe

Three-dimensional soil water storage variation
(0.15 m – height × 0.1 m – diameter), homogeneously, approaching 
the soil density to 1.7 kg.dm3. At the bottom of the PVC pipe, 
a thin screen with the function of only allowing water to pass 
through it was installed. The soil was saturated inside the tubes, 
then the TDR probe was inserted. With the soil in a saturated 
state, the measurements of PVC pipe + probe + soil + screen 
weight were initiated, in agreement with the measurements of 
dielectric constant (ka). Soil water content (θ) for each weighing 
was determined by Eq. 1:
The replicates were represented by the irrigation events, 
considering five irrigation events in each development stage 
of the plant. 
The different crop phenological stages were determined 
based on the methodology proposed by Allen et al. (1998):
I.	
Initial stage – from planting until 10% of soil cover 
(May 10 to May 23, 2016);
II.	
Vegetative growth – 10% of soil cover until total 
cover (May 23 to June 1, 2016); 
III.	 Flowering and fruit growth stage – appearance of 
first inflorescence until appearance of first fruit (June 
1 to June 14, 2016); 
IV.	 Maturation of fruit – appearance of first fruit until 
fruit maturation (June 14 to July 4, 2016).
The soil water storage variation (Δh) in the melon root 
zone was quantified by Eq. 3, applied to a region of interest 
in the profile (RiZi):

subsequent irrigation in “RiZi” and Ri and Zi are the limits 
of distance and depth, respectively; and n is the number of 
soil water content monitoring points considered (ranging 
from 1 to 40).
For each monitoring point, soil water availability was 
determined based on the values of soil water content at field 
capacity (pressure head – 1 m) and permanent wilting point 
(– 150 m), through Eq. 4:
where AW (Ri,Zi) is the soil water availability (%) in one point 
“RiZi” of the soil profile; θ(Ri,Zi) is the actual soil water content 
in “RiZi”; (m3∙m- 3); θpwp is the soil water content referring to 
the permanent wilting point and θfc is the soil water content 
referring to the field capacity.
The variability of soil water storage in the melon root zone 
was obtained according to the different soil water content 
Irrigation was daily performed and managed based on 
the soil water content obtained with TDR, considering the 
water volume necessary to bring the soil to field capacity.
Forty TDR probes were distributed inside the lysimeter in 
four monitoring profiles: P1, P2, P3, and P4, as illustrated in Fig.1. 
The profiles P1, P2, P3, and P4 represented the experimental 
distribution. The different monitoring positions were: 0.18, 0.36, 
0.54 m for the profiles 3 and 4, while for the profiles 1 and 2, the 
positions of the probes were 0.18 and 0.36 m.

monitoring positions and time, measured based on the 
values of coefficient of variation, following the criteria 
proposed by Warrick and Nielsen (1980), which consider 
the variability as low when CV < 12%, medium when
12% < CV < 60% and high when CV ≥ 60%.
In each melon development stage, a descriptive analysis 
of the soil water storage data was performed based on 
the values of mean, coeﬃ  cient of variation, asymmetry 
and kurtosis, calculated for the four profi les and the six 
irrigation events.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
 Soil water storage (Δh) variation in the melon 
root zone
Figure 2 shows the diff erences of Δh variation in the 
profi les with changes in the melon crop stages. Δh was > 0 
in the layers (Z-0.1 to Z-0.3 m) for all development stages 
of the melon crop. The highest intensity of Δh occurs 
in the flowering and fruit growth stage. For the initial 
development stage, the mean daily values of Δh ranged from

Three-dimensional soil water storage variation
5 × 10-3 cm3·cm-3 to 0.02 cm3·cm-3 in the most superfi cial soil 
layer: Z-0.1 m (means obtained with all radial distances). In 
the layer Z-0.1 m, in the stages of vegetative growth, fl owering 
and fruit growth and maturation of fruit, the mean values 
of soil water storage were 0.004 cm3·cm-3 to 0.023 cm3·cm-3, 
0.005 cm3·cm-3 to 0.042 cm3·cm-3 and 0.004 cm3·cm-3 to
0.032 cm3·cm-3, respectively.
Despite the increase in soil water storage over time, 
there was no percentage increase of soil water storage in the 
superfi cial layer for the other stages, indicating the increase 
of root activity in subsurface even in the fl owering stage. 
Th e percentage values of water outfl ow observed in the layer 
Z-0.1 m in relation to the total of the profi le were 42.25%, 
20.85%, 27.43% and 31.91% in the initial, vegetative growth, 
fl owering and fruit growth stages, respectively.
Th ere was an increase of 4.48% in uptake in the superfi cial 
layer for the fruit growth stage, indicating that the soil water 
storage activity occurs mostly in the layer Z-0.1 m for the melon 
crop under the studied conditions. In the vegetative growth stage, 
there was also an uptake activity in the layer Z-0.4 m, which 
can be attributed to the outfl ows through percolation inside the 
lysimeter, with a percentage value of 33.64% in relation to the total.
Th e values shown in Fig. 3 are mean contents of available 
water in the soil obtained in the same irrigation events, used to

calculate the values of soil water storage presented in Fig. 2. 
The contents of available water in the most superficial 
soil layer are always close to 100%, indicating the 
adequacy of the irrigation management based on water 
storage variation in the melon root zone, because the 
replacement of water to the soil is calculated as a function 
of the integration of the water volume necessary to 
bring soil moisture back to field capacity in each TDR-
monitored point.
It is possible to observe that the water distribution in the 
superficial layers occurs at an approximate distance of 0.25 m 
from the plant, forming a wet bulb with diameter of 0.5 m. 
Such water distribution is attributed to the emitter 
used, which irrigates only 14.02% of the area occupied 
by the plant.
Based on the coefficients of variation obtained with the 
values of the available water variability that generated Fig. 3, 
the variability of the available water contents after irrigation 
can be considered as high, in all evaluated soil layers 
(Table 2). The coefficients of variation obtained with the 
results of soil water storage variability that generated 
Fig. 2 are high, especially in the layer Z-0.1 m, where 
the highest uptake occurred in all crop stages.
The water uptake in the melon root zone was not 
proportional to the soil water availability, which is different 
from the results obtained by Coelho et al. (2010), Soulis 
et al. (2015) and Soulis and Elmaloglou (2016), indicating 
that application of water by irrigation system does 
not direct influence on soil water storage variation by 
melon crop. Silva et al. (2015) already observed that the 
variability of soil water storage in the banana root zone 
does not have a well-defined relationship with water 
availability.
Percent distribution of the total soil water 
storage in layers of the soil profile
Table 3 shows the results of the descriptive statistics 
for the percentage values of soil water storage in the zone 
of root activity of the melon crop, quantified at different 
monitoring positions in six irrigation events, in each of the 
crop development stages. The values in percent variation 
of soil water storage were considered as medium to high, 
following the classification criteria proposed by Warrick 
and Nielsen (1980).
Based on the criteria proposed by Jones (1969) to accept 
the hypothesis that a sample with 24 values follows normal 
distribution (4 profiles × 6 irrigations), the threshold values 
of asymmetry (G1) and kurtosis (G2) of the data set of soil 
water storage percentage obtained inside the lysimeter in 
each monitoring position (Rn, Zn) are -0.96 ≤ G1 ≤ 0.96 
and -1.20 ≤ G2 ≤ 2.32 (n=24). Since the probes installed 
at a distance of 0.54 m from the plant only appear in two 
profiles, the values of asymmetry (G1) and kurtosis (G2) were 
conditioned to 12 results (2 profiles × 6 irrigations), and G1 
varied from -1.278 to 1.278, while G2 varied from -1.56 to 
3.12. Based on the percentage values of soil water storage by 
the melon crop at distance R from the plant and depth Z, it 
is observed that not all values follow normal distribution.
Recommendation of the effective region of 
soil water storage in the melon root zone.
Although there was difference in the intensity of soil water 
storage variation by the melon root system in the layers over 
time, due to increase in water demand by the crop during its 
growth, the percent distribution of soil water storage in the

profiles does not vary as much as the intensity of soil water 
storage over time. This fact demonstrates that the temporal 
variability of water storage by the melon crop is greater than 
the spatial variability. A similar result was found by Silva 
et al. (2015), evaluating the variability of soil water storage by 
the root system of banana under micro-sprinkler irrigation.
Table 4 shows the mean percentage values and their 
standard deviations for the region delimited by the 
effective soil water storage in distance from the plant 
and depth, in all development stages. In the initial 
development stage, 86.56% of the water extracted in the 
profiles occurred until the layer of Z-0.3 m. The same 
occurs for the vegetative growth and the flowering and 
fruit growth stages, and the uptakes were respectively 
equal to 75.76, 77.06 and 70.34%. Considering as the 
region of highest water outflow intensity the one whose 
minimum limit of the total water extracted in distance 
and depth is 70%, the ideal region to install sensors and 
apply nutrients in the melon root zone is comprehended 
between R-0.36 m from the plant and Z-0.3 m of depth.

Considering that the soil volume for the determination 
of water balance in melon and other cucurbits is arbitrarily 
chosen (Mota et al. 2010; Monteiro et al. 2013), the results 
found in the present study also serve to indicate the 
monitoring volume of water balance, allowing to control 
the moisture where the root system has higher activity.
CONCLUSIONS
The soil water storage variation in the melon root 
zone occurs with greater intensity throughout the time 
of vegetative growth and the highest values are always 
observed in the same distances and depths of the soil in 
all phases of growth.
Th e region indicated as of greatest root activity of the 
melon crop under drip irrigation is delimited, in relation 
to the stem, by the radial distance of 0.36 m and depth of
0.3 m, for all of its development stages.
