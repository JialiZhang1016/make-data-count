ABSTRACT | Population aging has been occurring rapidly 
around the world, leading to the need for training for health 
professionals involved in caring for older adults, including 
the physical therapist. The aim of this study was to describe 
the profile of physical therapy courses in higher education 
institutions (HEIs) in Brazil regarding teaching directed to the 
health of older adults. This is an observational, cross-sectional 
study. A survey of information on physical therapy courses 
in Brazil was carried out through analysis of the curriculum, 
pedagogical projects and specific form. We analyzed 525 HEIs, 
of which 91.3% offer a discipline that addresses the health 
of older people, 98.4% of which is mandatory and 91.3% is 
the theoretical-practical type. In practice, 25.6% are in the 
internship field, with 81.9% carried out with older volunteers 
and 54.9% directed to all levels of care. When analyzing the 
distribution of the discipline by region, it was observed that it 
is more present in the Southeast (40.2%) (p=0.03). Most HEIs 
in Brazil address the health of older adults in the curriculum 
of the physical therapy course. However, the distribution of 
this discipline in the country is uneven, which can lead to 
divergences in therapeutic practice and represent losses in 
the quality of care for older people.

INTRODUCTION
Population aging is an accelerated phenomenon 
worldwide1. In Brazil, projections indicate that, between 2000 
and 2020, the absolute number of older people will double, 
and by 2030, it will surpass that of children and adolescents2. 
Associated with this, there is a change in the epidemiological 
profile, with a progressive increase in chronic-degenerative 
diseases, a predominance of functional disabilities and an 
overload of public spending on health3.
Considering all dimensions of older adults’ health and 
the multiplicity of the individual, the multiprofessional 
approach to health is the most appropriate1,4. It is necessary 
to evaluate not only aspects related to the body structure 
and function, but also the possible limitations in activities 
and restrictions on social participation, observing the 
contextual, personal and environmental factors involved5. 
However, it appears that although there are policies that 
support comprehensive care for the older people, embargoes 
regarding its practical application persist, as well as a lack of 
training for professionals.
The Brazilian Society of Geriatrics and Gerontology 
(SBGG) highlights the existence of several barriers to 
comprehensive care for older adults within the scope of 
the Unified Health System (SUS)6. Examples are the 
poor physical structure available, the difficulty in accessing 
diagnostic tests, the lack of human resources and training for 
professionals, which would lead to less effective assistance 
and worse health conditions for older people assisted6.
The World Health Organization (WHO) emphasizes 
the need for training professionals involved in caring for 
older adults as a strategy to ensure adequate assistance1. 
Among these professionals, we highlight the physical 
therapist, who acts on different organs and body systems, 
with the aim of preventing and treating functional kinetic 
disorders, promoting better functionality7. In this sense, the 
American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) recognizes 
the physical therapist as essential in caring for older people, 
working at different levels of healthcare and promoting 
improvements in their health conditions, which allows for 
a better quality of life8.
However, there are no studies that address the current 
situation of physical therapists trained in higher education 
institutions (HEIs) in Brazil, regarding the health of older 
adults. Considering the specificities of healthcare for older 
people, as well as the growing demand in this area, the 
role of the physical therapist in this scenario requires solid 
training. Thus, this study aims to describe the profile of 
physical therapy courses at higher education institutions 
in Brazil regarding teaching directed to the health of the 
older population.
METHODOLOGY
This is an observational, cross-sectional study carried out 
from February 2017 to February 2018, whose participants 
were Brazilian HEIs registered with the Ministry of 
Education (MEC) that offer the undergraduate course in 
physical therapy.
Procedures
Initially, a search was made on MEC’s website to survey 
the physical therapy courses operating in the country. All 
courses from public and private higher education institutions 
were included, without differentiating between universities, 
colleges, university centers and others, that were registered 
with the MEC and that had publicly available information 
about their curriculum or responded to an electronic form 
﻿Monteiro et al. Monteiro et al. Health of older people in physical therapy courses
95
The information obtained was classified according to 
the characteristics of the discipline, for a better presentation 
of the data, as described below: general, for all disciplines 
that address the health of older adults, which may include 
other stages of the life cycle; specific 1, for all disciplines that 
present content exclusively focused on the health of older 
adults; specific 2, for all the specific disciplines of physical 
therapy approach in older adults.
Statistical analysis 
Data analysis was performed using the Statistical Package 
for Social Sciences (SPSS) software, version 20.0. In the 
descriptive analysis, mean and standard deviation were 
used for quantitative variables, and absolute and relative 
frequencies for categorical variables. The chi-square test was 
used in the bivariate analysis to verify the relation between 
the presence of older adults health discipline and the regions 
of Brazil. The significance level assumed for all tests was 5%.
RESULTS
The search on the e-MEC portal obtained a total of 
684 HEIs with active registration for the physical therapy 
course, of which 42 (6.1%) were not found or did not 
have, on their websites, e-mail or telephone contacts. After 
successive attempts at contact, information was obtained on 
525 (76.7%) courses, either by electronic form or PP. The 
summary of the contact procedures with their respective 
results is shown in Figure 1.
about it. Then, a search was made on the e-mail addresses 
of these courses in order to obtain the pedagogical project 
(PP), or the curriculum, and the e-mail address. In cases 
when we could not obtain the e-mail via website, three 
attempts were made by telephone to request it.
After obtaining the e-mail addresses, a link was sent 
to remotely access a digital form that should be answered 
by the coordinators. This stage of the study aimed to 
confirm the data obtained from the collection of the PP 
and curriculum, avoiding possible information errors. 
For cases of divergence of information, a second contact was 
made via e-mail. When this contact was not successful, the 
response obtained by the electronic form was considered. We 
excluded from the analysis the courses in which we could 
not have any virtual contact, that did not have any physical 
therapy class in progress or who did not respond to attempts 
at contact and did not have PP and/or curriculum available 
at electronic addresses.
As for data collection, information was obtained about 
the existence of a specific discipline of the physical therapy 
approach in older adults, or that presents content directed 
to their health, as well as the existence of an extension 
project and/or graduate program in this area. In case of 
having this kind of discipline, the coordinators were asked 
about the requirement, workload, annual vacancies offered, 
existence of practical activities and their nature (laboratory 
and/or internship field, internship location, health care 
level), in addition to the specificity of the discipline. It was 
also inquired as to the maximum degree of the discipline’s 
professors. The information collected is in the public domain. 
Ethical criteria were observed throughout the research.

In the distribution of courses by region, 4 (0.8%) courses 
were excluded from the analysis due to the impossibility 
of identifying their location. Of the 521 physical therapy 
courses included, there was a predominance of courses 
in the state of São Paulo (25.9%). The only state with no 
functioning physical therapy course was Roraima. As for 
the region, there was a higher prevalence in the Southeast 
(39.9%) and lower in the North (5%).
Of the 525 courses analyzed, 475 (90.5%) belong 
to private educational institutions, 523 (99.6%) are 
offered in person and 494 (94.1%) offer disciplines that 
address the health of older adults (general). Regarding 
the specificity of the discipline in terms of gerontology, 
we obtained information on 458 courses, of which 
418 (91.3%) offer disciplines focused exclusively 
on the health of older people (specific 1). Of these, 
309 had data regarding the direction of the discipline, 
whether specific to physical therapy care (specific 2) or 
not, with 282 (91.3%) being considered specific to physical 
therapy (specific 2).
When analyzing the characteristics of the disciplines 
that address this topic, it is noted that the majority is 
mandatory (98.4%), of the theoretical-practical type 
(91.3%). There was a predominance of the title of master 
(51.6%) as the highest degree among professors who 
teach the course. The average course load was 84.5 (±85.3) 
hours, offering 72.7 (±40.1) annual vacancies (Table 1).
When the characteristics of the reported practical 
activities were verified, less than 30% of the disciplines 
have practices in internship fields, where the student has 
contact with older adults (81.9%) and experiences the 
three levels of healthcare (54.9%) (Table 2).

As for the existence of an extension project, information 
was obtained from 291 courses, of which 75 (25.8%) offer 
projects aimed at the care of older adults; 401 courses 
offered data on graduate programs, of which 68 (17%) 
have programs aimed at the health of older adults.
When analyzing the association between the presence 
of the discipline that addresses the health of older adults 
(general), specific 1 and specific 2 with the regions where 
the course is offered, a significant association was observed 
between the presence of the discipline that addresses the 
health of older adults (general) and the Southeast region

DISCUSSION
The aim of our study was to describe the profile of 
physical therapy courses in Brazil regarding teaching 
directed to the health of the older population. We found 
that most physical therapy courses address the health of 
older people in at least one discipline, but only part of 
the students have specific content for physical therapy 
care for older adults. Student access to content is ensured, 
as in most cases this discipline is mandatory. Despite 
having a theoretical-practical character, at the three levels 
of care, and being taught mainly by professors with a 
master’s degree, most students do not have access to the 
real practical environment of care for older adults, which 
will possibly hinder the future practice of this professional 
with that population.
The large number of physical therapy courses in 
Brazil increases the challenge of analyzing how these 
professionals are being prepared to deal with the aging 
process. The National Policy for Older Adults provides 
for the need to adapt the curriculum to the demographic 
transition in Brazil9. In this context, most Brazilian 
physical therapy courses have a discipline that includes 
the health of older people in their curriculum, which 
is mainly mandatory. There is a concern of the courses 
to follow the guidelines, also reinforced by the WHO, 
which emphasize the need to include themes in the 
curricula of all health courses directed to the health of 
the older population1. This panorama contributes to the 
training of physical therapists as general practitioners, 
as recommended by the National Curricular Guidelines 
for the Physical Therapy Course10.
However, this generalist formation is not uniform 
in the national territory, with a predominance in the 
Southeast region. Thus, the physical therapy student 
is submitted to different types of training, which may 
represent divergences in professional performance and 
deficiencies in the care received by older people in certain 
regions of the country. Therefore, the importance of 
standardizing the training of physical therapists is clear, 
in addition to the need for continuing education, aiming 
at complete training to deal with this population.
From didactic strategies to enhance learning, the 
insertion of new scenarios, which fit new content and 
practical activities, can redirect the perspective on health 
interventions11. Most physical therapy courses carry out 
practical activities added to the health of older people 
disciplines. Oh, Lee and Kim12 point out that the practice 
stimulates students with skills related to communication, 
problem-solving and interpersonal relationships, which 
would stimulate the development of essential skills for 
the future profession. Despite these positive data, we 
observed that most students do not have the opportunity 
to experience the practice with older people, limiting 
the practical experience itself. Such opportunities are 
spaces for the expression of conflicts and choices, where 
content is faced with individuality and ethics, favoring 
the articulation between theory and practice11.
In this context, the participation of students in the 
daily life of services allows responsible living in reality. 
Clinical practice based on the three levels of care favors 
the expansion of this scenario, guiding learning in 
problem-solving11. However, an important part of the 
Fisioter Pesqui. 2020;27(1):93-99
98
health practices of older adults does not include all levels 
of care. Evidence shows the need to ensure training that 
addresses the most different levels of health care, ensuring 
compliance with the National Curricular Guidelines for 
Undergraduate Physical Therapy Courses3,10,13,14. In the 
context of aging, such aspects become more relevant as 
the importance of prevention and health promotion for 
older adults is emphasized.
Miranda, Mendes and Silva3 highlight that the 
investment in the training of health professionals to work 
in gerontology is important to ensure good professional 
practices. However, our results point to a small number 
of graduate courses in the area of aging at universities, 
which would make it difficult for professionals to access 
the process of continuing education and research. 
According to WHO, continuing education is essential 
for guaranteeing good practices, improving available 
treatments and updating existing guidelines.
Our research limitation is the search for data from 
pedagogical projects and curricular programs available 
online, which may not be up to date. However, as an 
adjustment strategy, the data were confirmed through a 
specific questionnaire. In addition, there are no studies on 
the current training situation of physical therapists who 
have been trained in higher education institutions in Brazil 
with regard to the health of older people. The relevance 
of this study gains greater proportion considering Brazil’s 
huge geographic area, with very divergent regions that 
present a large number of physical therapy courses.
Given the above, we note the inclusion of health of 
older adults in the curricula of physical therapy courses in 
the country. However, this inclusion is not yet universal, 
which indicates that part of the graduated physical 
therapists may not have sufficient skills to deal with the 
older population in constant growth. In addition, there 
is a gap in continuing education, represented here by 
graduate students, limiting the production of knowledge. 
Finally, we suggest studies that investigate the quality of 
the content related to the health of older people taught 
in these courses, which may provide more details on the 
training of the physical therapist, allowing for a more 
in-depth analysis.
CONCLUSION
Most undergraduate courses of physical therapy at 
institutions of higher education in Brazil address the health 
of older people in the curriculum. The insertion of mandatory 
disciplines, of a theoretical-practical nature, addressing the 
three levels of care, with practical activities that include 
the care of older people, are signs of the intention of these 
institutions to adapt the training of the physical therapist 
to the demographic transition. However, the distribution of 
courses and disciplines in the country is uneven, which can 
lead to divergences in therapeutic performance. Knowing the 
profile of the professional that being trained is an essential 
factor for the quality of patient care.
