Abstract  -  In the present work, the potential of native isolates of fungi strains to biodegrade vegetable tannins 
used in the tanning industry was evaluated. Penicillium citrinum showed to be more efficient for consumption of 
acacia tannin, reaching 94.85%. Aspergillus chevalieri needs a greater adaptation phase (48 h) in both acacia and 
chestnut medium, evidenced by the slow growth (0.022 h-1) and low biomass productivity (0.31 g.L-1. h-1). The 
acacia tannin presented a higher COD/BOD ratio (2.97) and lower total phenol content (68%) when compared to 
chestnut tannin. In addition, there was greater consumption of this tannin in the cultivations, which contradicts 
previous reports and corroborates the results obtained with FTIR analysis that suggests the biodegradation of acacia 
by Penicillium citrinum and aethiopicum. The expressive results obtained demonstrated that the biodegradation 
of condensed tannins may be a promising alternative, with the potential to minimize tannery waste.

INTRODUCTION
Vegetable tannins can be easily extracted with 
water from almost all plants (Tondi and Petutschnigg, 
2015; Sundar and Muralidharan, 2017). They occur in 
bark, wood, fruits, fruit pods, leaves, roots, and plant 
galls and can accumulate in large quantities in certain 
organs or tissues of plants, being found mainly in the 
vacuoles of plants (Ricci et al., 2015). Vegetable tannins 
have the molecular weight between 500 and 3,000 Da 
and differ from most other phenolic compounds by 
their ability to form water-insoluble complexes with 
proteins, polysaccharides and alkaloids (Grasel and 
Ferrão, 2016). Considering their property to precipitate 
proteins, vegetable tannins have been traditionally 
explored to transform animal hides into leather (Haroun 
et al., 2013). This specific reactivity with proteins is 
called astringency, being the basis for their its use in the 
tanning industry (Khanbabaee and Ree, 2001). 
Raw 
hides 
are 
susceptible 
to 
attack 
by 
microorganisms. The collagen must be stabilized by 
the tanning process in which tanning agents react 
with the collagen matrix, stabilizing it and avoiding 
its degradation (Fuck et al., 2011). Due to the 
stringent requirements imposed on tanning industry, 
the development and implementation of cleaner 
technologies for environmental protection becomes 
increasingly imperative (Plavan et al., 2009; Pillai and 
Archana, 2012). For tanning this involves effort for the 
substitution of chromium by other tanning substances, 
making use of a combination of materials of inorganic 
origin (aluminum, silica, zinc, etc.) and organic 
(vegetable tannins, synthetic tannins, resins, aldehydes, 
etc.) to provide the required leather characteristics like 
stiffness, UV resistance. (Covington and Lampard, 
2004; Saravanabhavan et al., 2007; Maier et al., 2017). 
After the tanning process, liquid effluent is 
generated containing high organic loads, phenolic 
compounds, proteins, fat and neutral salts. It is 
estimated that 15% of the tannin used in tanning is 
discarded in the effluent. Vegetable tanning effluents 
show high chemical oxygen demand (COD) and bio-

chemical oxygen demand (BOD) (Guanamani et al., 
2001; Song and Burns, 2005). Due to the presence of 
tannins, the wastewaters are usually highly colored, 
which is very difficult to eliminate by common 
methods (He et al., 2007). They also exhibit long-term 
negative environmental effects, due to their toxicity 
for microorganisms (He et al., 2007; Teng et al., 
2016). The toxicity of tannins can be associated with 
several mechanisms such as substrate deprivation, loss 
of metal ions, and inactivation of microbial adhesins, 
enzymes, and cell envelope transport proteins (Bhoite 
and Murthy, 2015).
Tannins are a heterogeneous group of polyphenols 
widely present in the plant kingdom (pteridophytes, 
gymnosperms 
and 
angiosperms), 
secondary 
metabolites for protective purposes (Falcão and Araújo, 
2014). The chemical classification of tannins divides 
them into the groups of hydrolysable and condensed 
(Adamczyk et al., 2011). The hydrolyzable tannins 
are readily hydrolyzed by acids, alkalis or enzymes 
into a sugar or a related polyhydric alcohol (polyol) 
and a phenolic carboxylic acid (Haroun et al., 2013). 
The condensed tannins, also called proanthocyanidins, 
are oligomers and polymers composed of flavonoid 
units (Ricci et al., 2015). These compounds are used 
for many different applications, such as flocculants, 
anti-corrosion, tanning, adhesives, cement super 
plasticizers, pharmaceutical agents and foams (Grasel 
et al., 2016; Maier et al., 2017). A variety of vegetable 
tannins from different plants with different chemical 
constitutions and properties are used for tanning.
Tannin antimicrobial activity can be explained 
by their ability to complex irreversibly with proteins 
and therefore inhibit any activity (Maier et al., 
2017). When vegetable tannins are present in sludge, 
anaerobic digestion does not establish due to the their 
high toxicity and concentration (Agustini et al., 2018). 
Tannins are very recalcitrant; the presence of aromatic 
rings constitutes the main obstacle for the treatment 
of effluents that present phenolic compounds in their 
composition. However, some microorganisms are 
resistant to tannins and have the ability to degrade 
them by the action of enzymes (Silva et al., 2010). The 
main sources of enzymes are microorganisms such 
as bacteria, yeast and filamentous fungi. However, 
the interesting aspect to use fungi in the treatment 
of effluents containing compounds of this nature is 
the great ability of these microorganisms to produce 
enzymes (tannases, cellulases, ligninases, peroxidases) 
which make them more accessible to biodegradation 
(Luke and Burton 2001). Among the filamentous 
fungi, Aspergillus and Penicillium are important 
tannase producers (Valera et al., 2015).
The elimination of wide ranges of pollutants and 
wastes from the environment is a prerequisite for 
promoting sustainable development of our society 
with low environmental impact. Environmental 
sustainability in leather processing is possible with 
the use of biotechnology and clean technologies 
in tanneries through organic tannins and adequate 
environmental management of the solid wastes 
and liquid effluents generated. In this context, the 
biodegradation of condensed and hydrolysable 
tannins by native Penicillium citrinum, Penicillium 
aethiopicum, Aspergillus chevalieri and Aspergillus 
oryzae was investigated in this paper.
METHODOLOGY
Microorganisms
Fungal strains were collected from stored corn 
(Penicillium 
citrinum, 
Penicillium 
aethiopicum, 
Aspergillus chevalieri) and rice flour (Aspergillus 
oryzae) sampled in Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil. The 
fungi were isolated from inoculation of a tissue plug 
obtained from mycelia identified as described by 
Ortiz-Monsalve et al. (2017) and gently provided by 
the Laboratory of Mycology of the Federal University 
of Rio Grande do Sul. The strains were maintained on 
potato dextrose agar slants at 4 °C until use. Subcultures 
were made every three months on potato dextrose agar 
slants with a inoculation loop and incubated at 25 ºC 
for 4 a 5 days. After this time, the tubes were kept under 
refrigeration. The fungi are registered in GenBank with 
the following access numbers: Penicillium citrinum 
(MH532414), Penicillium aethiopicum (MH675468), 
Aspergillus chevalieri (MH532415) and Aspergillus 
oryzae (MH569333).
Shaken Flasks Cultivation
Five agar plugs (7 mm of diameter), taken from the 
edge of an actively growing colony (Anastasi et al., 
2011), were used to aseptically inoculate each 250 ml 
shake flask containing 50 ml of culture medium (g/l): 
tannin (40.0), KH2PO4 (4.38), (NH4)2SO4 (8.76), CaCl2 
· 2H2O (0.088), MgSO4 · 7H2O (0.88), Na2MnO4 · 
2H2O (0.0088), MnCl2 · 4H2O (0.018), FeSO4 · 7H2O 
(0.012) (Chávez-González et al., 2014). The flasks 
were incubated in an orbital shaker (200 rpm) at 25 °C 
for 120 h. Vegetable tannins powder from black acacia 
and chestnut provided by Tanac S.A and Silvateam S.A 
respectively, were used as the main source of carbon. 
The assays were performed in triplicate.
Analytical methods
The determination of the tannin concentration in the 
medium was carried out on a spectrophotometer (T80 
+ UV / Vis Spectrometer (PG Instruments Ltd.) using 
a wavelength of 278 nm obtained by scanning. The 
absorbance values were converted to concentration 
(g/L) through a calibration curve previously plotted 
for each tannin.

The biomass dry weight was determined after 
vacuum filtration through reweighed glass microfiber 
filters (Whatman, 45 μm pore and 50 mm diameter) 
and drying at 105 °C to a constant weight (Baccar et 
al., 2011). 
The determinations of total organic carbon (TOC) 
and total nitrogen (TN) of the culture medium were 
performed in a total organic carbon analyzer (TOC-L 
Shimadzu) equipped with a total nitrogen measuring 
unit (TNM-L Shimadzu) and 8-port sampler (OCT-L 
Shimadzu). Total phenols were estimated as tannic acid 
equivalents, according to the Folin-Ciocalteau assay 
(Sartori et al., 2014). The physicochemical analyses 
of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and bio-chemical 
oxygen demand (BOD) were performed according to 
the procedure described by Eaton et al. (2005). These 
determinations were performed at the beginning of 
cultivations.
Biodegradation was assessed using Fourier 
transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). FTIR analysis 
was carried out (MIR-FTIR, Perkin Elmer, FrontierTM 
spectrometer) in the mid-IR region of 500-4000 cm−1 
with 16 scan speed.
The experiments were performed in triplicate. The 
data were analyzed by analysis of variance and the 
Tukey test to verify the significant differences between 
the microorganisms under study, at a 95% confidence 
level (p ≤ 0.05), using Statistica 5.0 software (Stat Soft 
Inc., USA).
Calculation of growth parameters 
Maximum specific growth rate (µmax) was calculated 
at the exponential phase of growth using the following 
equation: 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Shake flask cultivation 
Tannin concentration, biomass and pH in fungi 
cultivations containing acacia and chestnut tannin 
are shown in Figure 1. A previous evaluation of the 
influence of pH on tannin consumption and biomass 
production was carried out using pH of 3.5, 4.5 and 5.5 
(data not shown). As no significant differences were 
found, it was decided to use the pH of the medium, 
without adjustment, around 4.5. 
It was observed that the pH of the culture medium 
decreased during the first 72 h (Figure 1a and 1d) 
and from this point onwards, remained practically 
constant except for the cultivation of Aspergillus 
chevalieri where a constant decline of the pH was 
coupled with the increase in biomass production until 
the end of the cultivation. This can be explained by 
the fact that Aspergillus chevalieri requires a greater 
adaptation phase to the culture medium while the other 
microorganisms since the beginning of the cultivation 
presented intense microbial activity, resulting in a 
faster decrease of pH. The pH changes of the medium 
throughout the culture are due to the metabolic activity 
of these microorganisms that have the capacity to 
produce organic acids. In this way the medium assumes 
acid values ​which represents a competitive advantage 
over other microorganisms (Kyriacou et al., 2005). 
The growth curves (Figure 1b e 1e) demonstrated 
that the maximum biomass values were reached at 72 
h for both acacia and chestnut cultivations, except for 
Aspergillus chevalieri, as also occurred for pH. By 
observing the biomass concentration obtained for the 
different fungi, it appears that, in the cultures with acacia 
tannin, there was greater growth of fungi of the genus 
Penicillium. There were no significant differences 
between the species (citrinum and aethiopicum). The 
best results were obtained with these fungi using 
acacia tannin as substrate. In chestnut cultivations, 
however, the highest concentrations of biomass were 
reached by fungi of the genus Aspergillus. There was 
also no significant difference between Aspergillus 
species. It was observed, however, that Aspergillus 
chevalieri needs a greater adaptation phase (48 h) for 
both acacia and chestnut medium. In acacia medium 
this is evidenced by the slow growth (0.022 h-1) and 
low biomass productivity (0.31 g.L-1. h-1), as shown 
in Table 1. According to Kyriacou et al. (2005) the 
microbial activity is directly influenced by the amount 
of biomass, observing better removal of COD.
Lipid accumulation in oleaginous fungi has been 
demonstrated to occur when a nutrient in the medium 
becomes limited and the carbon source is present in 
excess (high C/N ratio) (Khot et al., 2012). Nitrogen 
limitation is the most efficient condition for inducing 
lipogenesis. The results (Table 1) indicate that the C/N

ratio ranged from 8:1 to 6:1 for acacia and chestnut 
tannin, respectively. For lipid production, it would 
be necessary to optimize the culture medium in 
order to increase the C/N ratio of the medium. Lipid 
accumulation per liter of culture is usually optimal at 
molar C:N ratios exceeding 50 and near 100 (Ageitos 
et al., 2011). For instance, when optimum nutritional 
conditions for lipid production were studied for 
microbial lipid production by fungi, C/N= 31:1 and C/
N= 52:1 were found to be optimum, reaching 12.75% 
and 21.71% lipids for Penicillium citrinum and 
Aspergillus niger respectively (El-haj et al., 2015).
Biodegradation potential of acacia and chestnut 
tannin
The total phenols of tannins (Table 1) show that 
chestnut tannin presents a higher phenols content 
(73%) when compared to acacia tannin (68%), which 
corroborates the higher consumption of acacia tannin 
in cultivations. Mohanty and Jena (2017) reported that 
with the increase in the initial phenol concentration, 
a decrease in the percentage of phenol degradation 
was observed in cultures of Pseudomonas sp. NBM11. 
The presence of vegetable tannin in the effluent cause 
pollution problems that are usually toxic and xenobiotic. 
The residual amount of phenolic compounds is one 
of the major criteria of biodegradability. It has been 
found that the decomposition of phenolic compounds 
may significantly improve the biodegradability of 
preozonized phenolic compounds (Kanagaraj and 
Mandal, 2012). Aspergillus species have demonstrated 
efficiency in the degradation of phenolic compounds 
and has been used in the treatment of wastewater. 
Fungi of this genus use aromatic compounds through 
the production of catabolic enzymes (Rodrigues et 
al., 2007). It may be due to this efficiency that in the 
chestnut cultivations, where there was a higher content 
of total phenols, fungi of the genus Aspergillus and 
Penicillium had similar performance.	
Vegetable tannins are usually regarded as 
biodegradable chemicals because they are natural 
products. Nevertheless, biodegradation behaviors 
of vegetable tannin extracts might vary greatly with 
their sources, molecular structures and molecular 
weights. A common property of tannins is that they 
can be employed as carbon and energy sources by 
many microorganisms (Shi and Di, 2000). Some 
microorganisms resistant to tannins have developed 
mechanisms and pathways for tannin degradation. 
Earlier reports suggest that Aspergillus niger and 
Penicillium ssp are capable of growing in tannic 
acid as sole carbon source (Silva et al., 2010). It 
was verified (Table 1) that all fungi assimilated 
acacia and chestnut tannin as a carbon source. The 
range of tannin consumption varied from 94.85% 
for Penicillium citrinum cultivated in acacia tannin 
to 30.77% for Aspergillus oryzae cultivated in 
chestnut tannin. These species have been reported 
as microbial sources of tannase. Filamentous fungi 
of the Aspergillus genus have been widely used 
for tannase production because it can occur in the 
absence of tannic acid. Phenolic compounds such as 
gallic acid, pyrogallol, methyl gallate, and tannic acid 
induces tannase synthesis. For instance, gallic acid 
such as tannic acid, has been reported as an inducer 
of tannase synthesis under submerged fermentation 
(Aguilar et al., 2007). 
A particular property of vegetable tanning extracts 
is their hygroscopicity, miscible with water to form 
polydisperse solutions, partly of a colloidal type 
(Cassano et al., 2003). They are usually extensively 
used in processes of tanning and retanning so as to 
ensure full penetration of tannins and complete reaction 
between tannins and hides. Consequently, a part of 
tannins and of most non-tannins will inevitably remain 
in solution, which will lead to high loads of total solids 
and chemical oxygen demand (COD) in wastewater 
(Arana et al., 2001). During the tannage, tannins 
react with the hide fraction faster than non-tannin 
compounds. However, at the end of the process the 
concentration of tannin components is still significant. 
So the discharge of the bath represents an economical 
and environmental damage due to low biodegradability 
of tannins (Cassano et al., 2003). Compared with the 
aromatic syntans, aldehydic tanning agents and acrylic 
tanning agents, vegetable tannins are much easier to be 
biodegraded by tannery-activated sludge as reported 
by He et al. (2008). Meanwhile, hydrolysable tannin 
extracts exhibit better biodegradability than condensed 
tannin extracts. In this study, higher consumption of 
condensed tannin (acacia) was observed in relation to 
the hydrolysable tannin (chestnut) for all evaluated 
fungi. These results contradict the literature, which 
states that the condensed tannins are more resistant 
to degradation than hydrolysable tannins. Condensed 
tannins are not hydrolysed by classical tannases, 
with initial degradation steps carried out by mono- 
or-di-oxygenases (Contreras- Dominguez et al., 
2006). However, further studies are needed to further 
characterize the degradation of condensed tannin.
Earlier reports show that a concentration of tannins 
higher than 0.2 g/L in wastewater strongly inhibits 
microbial activity, while 2 g/L of tannins will completely 
inhibit it (Kalyanaraman et al., 2015). Besides that, the 
organic load removal is more sensitive to condensed 
tannin concentrations than to hydrolysable tannins 
(Dhayalan et al., 2007). According to Agustini et al. 
(2017), vegetable tannin in leather shavings showed an 
inhibitory effect for anaerobic biodegradation, where 
much of the residue underwent hydrolysis, but only a 
small part was mineralized to methane, resulting in an 
increase of organic matter.

It is possible to estimate the biodegradability of an 
effluent and its environmental impact on a hydrous 
body. Traditionally, the concentration of organic 
matter in wastewater is measured by total organic 
carbon (TOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), 
biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and chemical 
oxygen demand (COD) (Yang et al., 2014). The COD/
BOD ratio expresses a lot about what kind of oxidation 
will be effective in the degradation of the organic 
load. If COD/BOD < 2.5, the compound is easily 
biodegradable. If 5.0 >COD/ BOD> 2.5 this effluent 
will require care in choosing the biological process so 
that there is a desirable removal of the organic load 
(Braga et al., 2012). As can be seen in Table 1, the 
acacia tannin presented a slightly higher COD/BOD 
ratio than that presented by chestnut tannin, 2.97 and 
2.76, respectively. With values greater than 2.5 for the 
COD/BOD ratio, both are considered more difficult to 
be biodegraded.
Traditionally, the concentration of organic matter 
in wastewater is measured by total organic carbon 
(TOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), biochemical 
oxygen demand (BOD), and chemical oxygen demand 
(COD) (Yang et al., 2014). 
The characterization of tannin extracts by FTIR 
has been published by several authors with the main 
aim of characterizing the extracts of different plants 
(Falcão and Araujo, 2013; Tondi and Petutschnigg, 
2015; Grasel et al., 2016). In this context, FTIR was 
employed to evaluate the biodegradation of vegetable 
tannin by filamentous fungi (Figure 2). Phenols are 
organic compounds characterized by a hydroxyl 
groups bonded directly to an aromatic ring (benzene 
ring) (Blainski et al., 2013). Analysis of the spectra 
obtained shows peaks at 3000 to 3500 cm-1 due to 
the sum of the OH stretching that is characteristic of 
polyphenolic extracts. In addition, it could correspond 
to O-H stretch of the organic acids formed during the 
cultivation (Grasel et al., 2016). 
The region of the spectra between 950 and 600 
cm−1 features aromatic torsions, but mainly C-H 
bending out-of-plane (Tondi and Petutschnigg, 2015). 
The condensed tannins show a more structured profile 
with a more intense absorption in the region between 
1116 to 1110 cm−1 (Figure 2A), while the hydrolysable 
tannins present a major absorption at around 1731-
1704 cm−1 and 1325-1317 cm−1 (Figure 2B) (Falcão 
and Araújo, 2014; Ricci et al., 2015). The peak at 
1609 cm−1 for chestnut and 1612 cm−1 for acacia 
tannin correspond to C=C of aromatic rings (Falcão 
and Araújo, 2014). The disappearance or reduction 
of peaks in this region suggests the breakage of C=C 
bonds indicating the biodegradation of the condensed 
tannin, being more pronounced in the cultivations of 
Penicillium citrinum and Penicillium aethiopicum. 
The FTIR spectrum of the cultivations in chestnut 
tannin showed no significant change in the positions

or intensity of peaks (Figure 2B). This is probably due 
to the fact that there was low production of biomass 
and consumption of tannin in these cultivations. 
Studies on enhancing the biodegradation of 
tannins by ozonation and Fenton’s oxidation process 
(Kalyanaraman et al., 2015) have shown that the 
pre-ozonation improved the biodegradability and 
subsequent aerobic treatment carried out in batch 
aerobic reactors resulted in BOD5 and COD of 60 
and 350 mg/L in the treated effluent. FT-IR results 
showed the presence of biodegradable organics like 
carboxylic acids, aldehydes and quinones in pre-
ozonated wastewater. Fenton pre-treatment resulted 
in a considerable increase in biodegradability with 
mineralization.
CONCLUSIONS
The present investigation was carried out in order 
to determine the potential of the fungi of the genera

Penicillium and Aspergillus to biodegrade condensed 
and hydrolysable tannins. Penicillium citrinum 
and Penicillium aethiopicum were it to be more 
efficient, reaching 94.85% and 91.45% respectively 
for consumption of acacia tannin. In the chestnut 
cultivations the tannin consumption was low, not 
exceeding 36.28%, there being no differences between 
the genera of the fungi. The acacia tannin presented 
a slightly higher COD/BOD ratio than that presented 
by chestnut tannin, 2.97 and 2.76, respectively . On 
the other hand, chestnut tannin present a higher total 
phenols (73%) compared to acacia (68%). In this 
study, a higher consumption of condensed tannin 
(acacia) was observed in relation to the hydrolysable 
tannin (chestnut) for the evaluated fungi. The 
disappearance of peaks around 1600 cm-1 suggests the 
biodegradation of the condensed tannin by Penicillium 
citrinum and Penicillium aethiopicum. The expressive 
results obtained forom the consumption of acacia 
evidently suggest that the native isolates identified as 
Penicillium citrinum and Penicillium aethiopicum are 
efficient strains for the biodegradation of the tannin 
most used in tannery industry. Though some reports 
about tannin degradation by filamentous fungi are 
available, literature showing expressive consumption 
of a condensed tannin was not found. Therefore, the 
biodegradation of vegetable tannins by Penicillium 
citrinum and aethiopicum, Aspergillus chevalieri and 
oryzae may be a promising alternative.
