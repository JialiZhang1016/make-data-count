Theobromine, an organic compound from the purine alkaloid group, is much less soluble in polar solvents
than its analogues, i.e. caffeine and theophylline, that is why it has been used as an active pharmaceutical
ingredient (API) model in cocrystal preparation. A series of theobromine (TBR) cocrystallization processes
from solutions with such coformers as 2-hydroxybenzoic acid (2HBA), 3-hydroxybenzoic acid (3HBA) and
4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4HBA) were carried out. In addition, neat grinding and liquid-assisted grinding were
performed. The obtained cocrystals TBR·2HBA and TBR·3HBA as well as TBR·2Ĳ4HBA)·H2O cocrystal
monohydrate have been characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction (SXRD), PXRD, UV-vis and STA
(TGA/DSC) analyses. In all cases no proton transfer from the acid molecule to the imidazole nitrogen atom
in theobromine was observed. TBR–acid heterosynthons are sustained by N⋯H–O interactions, where pro-
ton donors in TBR·2HBA and TBR·3HBA are carboxylic groups, and in TBR·2Ĳ4HBA)·H2O the proton donor
is the hydroxyl group of the acid molecule. In each cocrystal, TBR–TBR homosynthon R2
2(8) formation by
N–H⋯O hydrogen bonds was observed. Acid–acid dimers are created only in the crystal lattice of TBR
·2Ĳ4HBA)·H2O. In the obtained cocrystals, similar supramolecular synthons were observed, such as in the-
ophylline and caffeine cocrystals with the same coformers. C–H⋯O and π⋯π forces present in the de-
scribed structures are responsible for 2D and 3D structure stabilization.
1. Introduction
The term “cocrystal” was used for the first time by Friedrich
Wöhler in 1844 for quinhydrone, which consists of quinone
and hydroquinone.1 Cocrystals can be defined as homoge-
neous solids, composed of two or more substances (molecular
and/or ionic) with a well-defined stoichiometric ratio, except
simple salts and solvates. Their components have to be solids
under ambient conditions.2 In 2004, a subgroup of cocrystals
was defined, where one of the components is an active phar-
maceutical ingredient (API).3 A new drug has to undergo a se-
ries of clinical trials, before it is placed on the market. Unfor-
tunately, a lot of medicines (60–70%), which have good
pharmacological properties, are characterized by poor aque-
ous solubility, which results in poor bioavailability.4–6 In this
case, improvement of the physicochemical properties such as
solubility, stability, permeability or tabletability is crucial
from the perspective of drug companies. The long times
needed for introducing drugs on the market are usually
connected with higher costs for pharmaceutical companies. A
lot of methods like particle size reduction,7 nanoparticle for-
mation,8 encapsulation9 self-emulsifying drug delivery system
(SEDDS),10 salt formation,11 complexation,12 etc. can be used
to
improve
the
solubility
of
APIs
in
water.
Moreover,
cocrystallization of APIs with selected coformers is also used to
improve
the
medicine's
properties.13
Cafcit
(caffeine
cit-
rate),14,15 Steglatro (ertugliflozin L-pyroglutamic acid)16,17 and
Lexapro (escitalopram oxalate)18,19 are examples of medicine
cocrystals. When it comes to the advantages of this method,
APIs can exist in a stable crystalline form and their pharma-
cological activity is maintained while improving the physico-
chemical properties.
Theobromine is an organic compound, which belongs to
the purine alkaloid group. It is present in cacao, yerba mate,
kola nut, the guarana berry and the tea plant.20 It is one of
the metabolites formed in the human liver as a result of caf-
feine demethylation.21 It affects the nervous system (cAMP

deactivation). It is a vasodilator and heart stimulant and it
has diuretic properties.22 For these reasons, it can be classi-
fied as an API but currently it is rarely used in the pharma-
ceutical industry. Although the theobromine molecule is
structurally similar to paraxanthine, theophylline and caf-
feine, it is less soluble in water than them (0.33 g L−1 for
theobromine, 1 g L−1 for paraxanthine, 7.4 g L−1 for theophyl-
line, and 21.6 g L−1 for caffeine).23 That is why theobromine
was chosen as an API model for cocrystallization and as a re-
sult,
its
solubility
in
water
can
be
improved.
Mono-
hydroxybenzoic acids were used as coformers, because they
have proton-donor groups. Our choice is also related to an
earlier use of these coformers for theophylline and caffeine
cocrystallization (Fig. 1).24,25
In this paper, two cocrystals of theobromine (TBR) with
2-hydroxybenzoic acid (2HBA) and 3-hydroxybenzoic acid
(3HBA), and a cocrystal hydrate with 4-hydroxybenzoic acid
(4HBA) were reported.
All of these solids were obtained by slow evaporation from
different solutions and they were analyzed by a single-crystal
X-ray diffraction method. Steady-state UV-vis spectroscopy was
used to determine the cocrystal solubility. Additionally, simul-
taneous thermal analysis (STA) measurement was carried out.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
TBR (99%) was purchased from Swiss Herbal Institute. 2HBA
(≥99%), 3HBA (99%) and 4HBA (≥99%) were obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich. Hydroxybenzoic acids were used for cocrystalli-
zation without purification. Methanol was purchased from
Chempur and ethanol from Stanlab. In all absorption experi-
ments, Millipore distilled water (18 MΩ cm) was used.
2.2. Crystallographic database CSD search
To date, 31 different structures containing theobromine have
been reported and they are available in the Cambridge Struc-
tural Database.26 10 of them contain carboxylic acid, such as
5-chlorosalicylic
acid
(CSATBR),
oxalic
acid
(GORGUR),
trifluoroacetic acid (HIJYAB), malonic acid (HIJYEF), gallic
acid
(MUPPET),
acetic
acid
(NURYUV),
salicylic
acid
(RUTHEV), anthranilic acid (ZIZRUX and ZIZRUX01), and
4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoic acid (ZOYBOG). Only five of them
are composed of theobromine and a benzoic acid derivative:
CSATBR, MUPPET, RUTHEV, ZIZRUX, and ZOYBOG. The
ConQuest program was used for searching deposited struc-
tures containing theobromine.26,27
2.3. Cocrystal preparation
2.3.1. Cocrystallization by slow evaporation from solution.
Single crystals of TBR·2HBA and TBR·3HBA were obtained by
slow
evaporation
from
ethanol–water
solution,
and
TBR
·2Ĳ4HBA)·H2O crystals from methanol–water solution. We used
stoichiometric ratios of theobromine and the particular mono-
hydroxybenzoic acid. TBR (16.1 mg, 0.09 mmol) with 2HBA
(12.5 mg, 0.09 mmol), TBR (17.5 mg, 0.097 mmol) with 3HBA
(13.4 mg, 0.097 mmol) and TBR (13.5 mg, 0.075 mmol) with
4HBA (20.7 mg, 0.15 mmol) were dissolved by heating and stir-
ring, respectively. Monocrystals were obtained by slow evapora-
tion of filtrates under ambient conditions within 3–5 days.
2.3.2. Cocrystallization by grinding. Substance cogrinding
was carried out in stainless steel milling jars, where the stoi-
chiometric amounts of theobromine with the given acid and
two 6 mm stainless steel balls were placed inside. TBR (16.0
mg, 0.089 mmol) with 2HBA (12.5 mg, 0.091 mmol) and TBR
(17.8 mg, 0.099 mmol) with 3HBA (13.7 mg, 0.099 mmol)
were subjected to neat grinding, respectively. TBR (12.0 mg,
0.067 mmol) and 4HBA (18.5 mg, 0.134 mmol) were co-
ground with the addition of 20 μl of water. Milling was
performed using an oscillatory ball mill Retsch MM300 for 45
minutes at a frequency of 25 Hz.
2.4. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SXRD)
X-ray diffraction data were collected on an Oxford Diffraction
SuperNova diffractometer equipped with a CuKα radiation
source (λ = 1.54178 Å) and with a Cryojet cooling system.
CrysAlisPro28 and CrysAlisRed29 were used for data collection
and data reduction, respectively. Multi-scan absorption correc-
tion was applied to the diffraction data.30 Olex2 software was
used as an interface to facilitate the solution, refinement and
structural analysis.31 The structures were solved using intrinsic
phasing with SHELXT-2015 and were refined with SHELXL-2015
software.32 For non-hydrogen atoms, refinements were carried
out with anisotropic atomic displacement parameters. All hy-
drogen atoms were derived from a difference Fourier map and
they were refined isotropically. In TBR·2Ĳ4HBA)·H2O, hydrogen
atoms of two carboxyl groups are disordered over two positions
and they were refined with restraints (occupancies 0.5 for H1C
and H2C atoms, 0.25 for H1D and 0.75 for H2D atoms). The
extinction coefficient was applied in the refinement of
TBR·2HBA and TBR·3HBA structures. The crystallographic
data and refinement details are presented in Tables 1 and 2.
2.5. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD)
Powder samples of components and cocrystals synthesized by
grinding and by slow evaporation from solution were mea-
sured on an Oxford Diffraction Xcalibur diffractometer with a
MoKα radiation source (λ = 0.71073 Å) at room temperature.
The main goal of using the grinding method was to test this
technique as an alternative way for this cocrystal synthesis.
Experimental conditions: scanning intervals, 5–50° (2θ); step
size, 0.01°; and time per step, 0.5 s. CrysAlisPro28 was used
for data collection. The experimental and calculated powder

patterns from the crystal structures were analyzed using Kdif
software.33
2.6. Solubility studies of cocrystals by steady-state absorption
spectroscopy
Steady-state UV-vis spectroscopy was used to determine the
cocrystal solubility in distilled water. The powdered samples
of cocrystals obtained by cocrystallization from solution were
used for measurements. UV-vis absorption spectra were
recorded using a two-beam spectrometer Cary 100 UV-vis
scanning from 200 to 800 nm with 1 nm increments. Quartz
cells with an optical length of 10 mm were used. Calibration
curves of every cocrystal were prepared (Fig. S1†). Substance
concentrations versus absorbance of the substance at detec-
tion wavelength (Table 1) were plotted. A linear relationship
was obtained and the slope was calculated from the graph.
To determine the solubility of the cocrystals, saturated
aqueous solutions of each were prepared. The absorbance at
detection wavelength (λdet) was measured and the concentra-
tion of the substance was calculated by applying the follow-
ing relationship:

2.7. Simultaneous thermal analysis (STA)
The thermal properties of the samples were characterized
using a STA analyser (Perkin-Elmer STA6000). The sample
measurements were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere
from room temperature to 400 °C at 10 °C min−1.
3. Results and discussion

monohydroxybenzoic acids are presented. This dimethyl-

crystals. A hydrate was formed by combination of TBR and
4HBA (1 : 2). The bond lengths of C–O and CO indicate the
carboxylic
group
geometry.
The
difference
Fourier
map
clearly shows the position of the acidic hydrogen atom near
the oxygen atom of the carboxyl group in 2HBA and 3HBA.
There is no proton transfer from hydroxyl groups of the
4HBA molecules to the imidazole nitrogen atom of TBR
(Table 3).
The ΔpKa parameter, described by the following equation:
ΔpKa = pKa(base) −pKa(acid)
(2)
allows prediction of salt or cocrystal formation.34 The de-
termined values of ΔpKa are less than zero. So, there is a high
probability that the combination of theobromine with mono-
hydroxybenzoic acids would result in cocrystals.
3.1. Crystal structure of the investigated cocrystals
3.1.1. TBR·2HBA cocrystal. For the first time, a theobro-
mine (TBR) 2-hydroxybenzoic acid (2HBA) cocrystal was
obtained by F. Fischer et al. in 2015 by cocrystallization from
solution and by neat grinding.35 The structure was refined to
an R value of 10.16%. In the above paper, there is no descrip-
tion of hydrogen bonds present in TBR·2HBA. Therefore, we
decided to repeat the cocrystallization and X-ray analysis to
obtain satisfactory refinement parameters.
TBR·2HBA crystallizes in the triclinic space group P1¯ with
one TBR and one 2HBA molecule in the asymmetric unit
(Fig. 2a). Typical C–O and CO bond lengths of the carbox-
ylic group were observed (1.310(1) Å for C7–O2 and 1.233(2) Å
for C7O1), which confirmed the crystallochemical nature of
this cocrystal. Each TBR molecule is hydrogen bonded to
2HBA via O2–H2⋯N4 interaction (synthon III, Fig. 3 and
Table 4). The ortho-hydroxyl group in 2HBA participates in
intramolecular
hydrogen
bonding
O3–H3⋯O1
and
six-
membered ring S1
1(6) is formed. In the crystal lattice, a finite
centrosymmetric
four-component
system
was
identified
(Fig. 2b). In this system two molecules of TBR interact via
N1–H1⋯O4ii hydrogen bonds (synthon II).
TBR-2HBA tetramers are connected by C–H⋯O forces cre-
ating a 2D layer parallel to the crystallographic plane (21¯0).
The oxygen atom of the endo-carbonyl group of TBR partici-
pates in C6–H6⋯O5i hydrogen bonding (Table 4), which to-
gether with the COOH⋯Nimidazole heterosynthon forms the
R4
4(22) motif. Carbon atom C14 of the methyl group at the im-
idazole ring acts as a donor in C14–H14C⋯O3iv interaction,
which takes part in cyclic array R6
6(22) formation (Fig. 2b).
Two TBR molecules in neighboring sheets are connected
through C14–H14B⋯O4iv hydrogen bonding. Layers are ar-
ranged in an offset manner and form stacks (Fig. 2c), which
are held together by π(TBR)⋯π(2HBA) forces (Fig. 2d and
Table 5).

3.1.2. TBR·3HBA cocrystal. The TBR·3HBA cocrystal, which
crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/c, contains one
TBR
and
one
3HBA
molecule
in
the
asymmetric
unit
(Fig. 4a). The bond lengths of C–O (1.327(1) Å) and CO
(1.217(2) Å) confirmed that a cocrystal was obtained. In the
crystal lattice, four-component centrosymmetric motif R4
4(26)
composed of two TBR and two 3HBA molecules is observed
(Fig. 4b). This alkaloid is hydrogen bonded to two 3HBA mol-
ecules
by
O2–H2⋯N4
(synthon
III)
and
O3–H3⋯O5iii
(synthon V) hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3 and Table 4). TBR–TBR
dimers R2
2(8) are held by N1–H1⋯O4ii (synthon II) interac-
tion, where the exo-carbonyl of TBR is involved in this
formation.
The components of this cocrystal are arranged in ribbons
parallel to the (1¯52) and (152¯) crystallographic planes, which
are inclined by γ = 100.6Ĳ1)° and form the “zigzag” sheet
(Fig. 5a) by C5–H5⋯O3i interactions between 3HBA mole-
cules (Fig. 4c). The 1D ribbons form stacks, which are
sustained by π(TBR)⋯π(TBR) and π(TBR)⋯π(3HBA) forces
(Fig. 5b and Table 5). The average distance between neigh-
boring layers is equal to 3.159(1) Å. The distance between

half (1/2 W) of the O1⋯O1x,−1 + y, z distance (Fig. 5a).
3.1.3. TBR·2Ĳ4HBA)·H2O cocrystal hydrate. Theobromine
(TBR) and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4HBA) cocrystallize as a
monohydrate in the triclinic space group P1¯. The asymmetric
unit contains two hydrate systems (I and II, Fig. 6a). Each of
the hydrates forms a 1D ribbon with the same hydrogen
bond architecture (Fig. 6b). In this system, we can distin-
guish TBR–TBR and 4HBA–4HBA dimers R2
2(8) held by
N–H⋯O (synthon I, Fig. 3) and O–H⋯O hydrogen bonds, re-
spectively (Table 4). The hydroxyl group of one 4HBA mole-
cule is connected with the imidazole nitrogen atom of TBR
through O–H⋯N interaction (synthon IV), and the hydroxyl
group of the second 4HBA molecule is a proton donor for the
oxygen atom from the water molecule (O–H⋯O interaction).
Hydrogen atoms of the solvent are hydrogen bonded to the
oxygen atom from the exo-carbonyl group of one TBR mole-
cule (synthon VIII) and from the endo-carbonyl group of the
second TBR molecule (synthon VII) via O–H⋯O hydrogen
bonds, respectively. In this way, together with N–H⋯O forces,
motifs R2
3(8) are formed. In the 1D ribbon, C–H⋯O interac-
tions are present, where aromatic carbon atoms of 4HBA
molecules are proton donors for two oxygen atoms of the
neighboring acid–acid dimer.
By means of C–H⋯O hydrogen bonds, neighboring 1D
polymers
in
TBR·2Ĳ4HBA)·H2O
are
arranged
in
layers
(Fig. 6b). The methyl groups at the imidazole ring are proton
donors for oxygen atoms of the exo-carbonyl groups in TBR.
In the second interaction, the imidazole carbon atom is a

water molecule. π(TBR)⋯π(K4HB) interactions (Fig. 7b and
Table 5) are responsible for creating stacks (Fig. 7a).
3.2. Comparison of supramolecular synthons found in
theobromine, caffeine and theophylline cocrystals with
monohydroxybenzoic acids
Molecules of theobromine (3,7-dimethylxanthine), theophyl-
line
(1,3-dimethylxanthine)
and
caffeine
(1,3,7-trimethyl-
xanthine) differ by the number and the position of the methyl
group(s).
Three
nitrogen
atoms
of
the
caffeine
molecule
are
substituted by methyl groups, therefore this purine molecule
cannot form any CAF–CAF homodimer by strong classical hy-
drogen bonds. In turn, in theophylline one kind of TPH–TPH
homodimer R2
2(10) with the participation of COĲendo-
carbonyl)
and
N–HĲimidazole)
groups
can
be
observed
(Fig. 8E). However, in the theobromine molecule, there are
two possibilities of TBR–TBR homosynthon R2
2(8) amide–am-
ide formation via COĲexo-carbonyl) or COĲendo-carbonyl)
together
with
the
N–HĲpyrimidine)
group,
respectively
(Fig. 8B). The carboxylic acid–carboxylic acid homosynthon is
popular37 (Fig. 8A), but in the presence of the alkaline imid-
azole nitrogen atom this hydrogen-bonded moiety is uncom-
mon.38 Below, the supramolecular synthons in theobromine
cocrystals with monohydroxybenzoic acids are discussed and
compared with theophylline and caffeine cocrystals with the
same coformers (Table 6).
3.2.1. Purine alkaloid cocrystals with 2-hydroxybenzoic
acid as a coformer. In the above alkaloid cocrystals with
2-hydroxybenzoic acid, according to Etter's rules,39 first an
intramolecular O–H⋯O hydrogen bond with an S1
1(6) motif is
expected, which mainly stabilizes the carboxylic acid mole-
cule (Fig. 8C). Consequently, cocrystal formation is only pos-
sible
by
intermolecular
COOH⋯Nimidazole
interactions

(Fig. 8G). In TBR·2HBA and TPH·2HBA cocrystals, one can
also expect TBR–TBR and TPH–TPH homosynthons, respec-
tively (Fig. 8B and E).
In the CAF·2HBA cocrystal, the alkaloid and acid molecule
form a two-molecular complex by a COOH⋯N hydrogen
bond (Fig. 8G). The remaining interactions are weak stacking
interactions (1D and 2D structures) and C–H⋯O hydrogen
bonds
(3D
structure).25
In
the
case
of
the
TPH·2HBA
cocrystal, the COOH⋯Nimidazole heterosynthon, the TPH–TPH
homosynthon R2
2(10) (Fig. 8E) and the acid–acid hetero-
synthon held through O–HĲo-hydroxyl)⋯OC(carboxyl) hy-
drogen bonds (Fig. 8F) are responsible for the 1D molecular
ribbon formation. In turn, 2D and 3D architectures of
TPH·2HBA are stabilized by C–H⋯O and π-stacking interac-
tions, respectively.24 In both structures, the intramolecular
O–H⋯O interaction in salicylic acid was observed. (Fig. 8C).
In the TBR·2HBA crystal lattice, TBR–TBR R2
2(8) dimers hy-
drogen bonded via N–HĲpyrimidine)⋯OC(exo-carbonyl) in-
teractions
(Fig.
8B),
TBR–2HBA
dimers
sustained
by
COOH⋯Nimidazole hydrogen bonds (Fig. 8G) and the S1
1(6) cy-
clic array in the 2HBA acid (Fig. 8C) are in line with expecta-
tions. These synthons are some of the most common
hydrogen-bonded motifs present in organic cocrystals.37
3.2.2. Purine alkaloid cocrystals with 3-hydroxybenzoic
acid
as
a
coformer.
The
hydroxyl
group
in
the
3-hydroxybenzoic acid is in the meta-position, so it cannot
take part in intramolecular hydrogen bond formation. This
group can probably be a proton acceptor from the endo- or
exo-carbonyl
oxygen
atoms
in
alkaloid
molecules.
In
CAF·3HBA25 and TPH·3HBA24 cocrystals, the hydroxyl groups in
acid molecules are proton donors for the endo-carbonyl groups
in caffeine and theophylline molecules, respectively (Fig. 8F).
The COOH⋯Nimidazole heterosynthon (Fig. 8G) is present in
both complexes. In the TPH·3HBA cocrystal, theophylline
molecules
form
TPH–TPH
homodimers
by
COĲexo-
carbonyl)⋯H–NĲimidazole) hydrogen bonds (Fig. 8E).
The structural motifs in TBR·3HBA are similar to those
aforementioned in CAF and TPH analogues. The theobro-
mine
molecules
form
homosynthons
held
by
N–
HĲpyrimidine)⋯OC(exo-carbonyl) hydrogen bonds (Fig. 8B),
TBR–3HBA systems are held by COOH⋯Nimidazole interac-
tions (Fig. 8G) and the meta-hydroxyl group in the acid is a
proton donor for the oxygen atom in the endo-carbonyl group
of this xanthine molecule (Fig. 8F). So, based on the caffeine
and theophylline complexes with 3-hydroxybenzoic acid, it
was possible to predict which synthons would be responsible
for the crystal lattice arrangement in the theobromine
cocrystal with the investigated coformer. The 2D and 3D net-
works of these cocrystals are sustained by C–H⋯O and stack-
ing interactions.
3.2.3. Purine alkaloid cocrystals with 4-hydroxybenzoic
acid as a coformer. In the case of the 4-hydroxybenzoic acid,
there
are
3
combinations
of
this
coformer
with
caf-
feine.24,25,36
In
each
of
these
combinations,
the
Nimidazole⋯HOOC heterosynthon can be observed (Fig. 8G).
In CAF·2Ĳ4HBA), oxygen atoms in the para-hydroxyl group of
the acid molecules are proton donors for the endo- and
exo-carbonyl oxygen atoms in caffeine, however in 2ĲCAF)
·4HBA
this
group
is
a
proton
donor
only
for
the
endo-carbonyl oxygen atom (Fig. 8F). In the CAF·4HBA·H2O
complex, the water molecule is a proton acceptor from the
para-hydroxyl group in 4HBA and it is also a proton donor
for the endo- and exo-carbonyl groups in the alkaloid mole-
cule (Fig. 8F for the water molecule). What is more, in the
CAF·2Ĳ4HBA) cocrystal, acid molecule pairs are connected
via
O–HĲcarboxyl)⋯OC(carboxyl)
hydrogen
bonds.

TPH·4HBA, theophylline molecules are connected with one
acid molecule by Nimidazole⋯HO interaction (Fig. 8H) and
with the second one by O–HĲcarboxyl)⋯OC(exo-carbonyl)
and COĲcarboxyl)⋯H–NĲimidazole) hydrogen bonds (R2
2(9)
motif, Fig. 8D). Homosynthons are not observed in these
cocrystals. Thus, it was difficult to predict whether the com-
bination of theobromine and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid would re-
sult in a cocrystal or cocrystal hydrate, and what stoichiome-
try of substrates and which synthons would be responsible
for the arrangement of these components in complex.
Theobromine and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid cocrystallize in a
1 : 2 : 1 stoichiometric ratio together with a water molecule
and form a cocrystal hydrate. In this structure, we recognized
two types of homosynthons, i.e. the TBR–TBR homodimer,
which are held by COĲendo-carbonyl)⋯H–NĲpyrimidine) hy-
drogen bonding (Fig. 8B) and the acid–acid homosynthon be-
tween two carboxylic groups (Fig. 8A). The imidazole nitrogen
atom accepts a proton from the hydroxyl group of one acid
molecule (Fig. 8H). In purine cocrystals with 2HBA and
3HBA, this synthon is not observed. The hydroxyl group of
the second acid molecule is a proton donor to water mole-
cule, which is in turn the donor of two protons to endo- and
exo-carbonyl oxygen atoms of two different theobromine mol-
ecules
(Fig.
8F).

3.3. Powder X-ray diffraction
The powder diffractograms of theobromine (API), coformers
(2-, 3- and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid) and the studied cocrystals
were obtained (Fig. 9–11). The differences between the
diffractograms of the substrates and the cocrystals are clearly
visible. What is more, the similarity of the powder patterns
for the cocrystal samples obtained by crystallization from the
solution and the milling samples indicates that grinding is
an alternative method for the preparation of the studied
theobromine derivatives.

times enhancement of the theobromine solubility in relation
to pure alkaloid was observed. Surprisingly, there is no rela-
tionship between the aqueous solubility of coformers and the
enhancement of coformers.40
3.4.2.
Solubility
enhancement
of
theobromine
in
cocrystals and their crystal structure. The better solubility of
the theobromine cocrystal with the ortho-hydroxybenzoic acid
in comparison to that with the meta isomer can be explained
by intermolecular interactions. Although both compounds
crystallize in different space groups (P1¯ and P21/c), their ar-
chitecture
is
comparable.
In
TBR·2HBA
and
TBR·3HBA
cocrystals, an identical R2
2(8) synthon is observed. Addition-
ally, similar structural motifs R4
4(22) and R6
6(22) in TBR·2HBA
and R4
4(26) in TBR·3HBA are recognized. The main difference
between the crystal structures of these cocrystals is the
strength of intermolecular interactions. In the first, more sol-
uble cocrystal, the presented motifs are formed by O–H⋯N
and
weak
C–H⋯O
forces,
whereas
R4
4(26)
systems
in
TBR·3HBA are stabilized by strong classical O–H⋯O/N hydro-
gen bonds. The theobromine solubility in the TBR·2Ĳ4HBA)
·H2O cocrystal hydrate is lower than that in TBR·2HBA and
greater than that in TBR·3HBA. This may be due to the pres-
ence of a water molecule in the crystal lattice and more im-
pact of strong hydrogen bonds on the molecular arrangement
compared to TBR·2HBA.
3.5. Simultaneous thermal analysis (STA)
Fig. 12 shows the TGA and DSC curves of TBR·2HBA,
TBR·3HBA and TBR·2Ĳ4HBA)·H2O.
The presence of water in the TBR·2Ĳ4HBA)·H2O crystal
structure is evident from the DSC measurements. The first
signal of the cocrystal appears at a temperature of about
113 °C. It can be assumed that the water molecules from
the crystal structure are released. The second signal, at 215
°C, refers to the complete decomposition of the 4HBA mole-
cules, and is in agreement with the melting point of pure
4HBA.42 The signal at 315 °C is attributed to the decompo-
sition of the TBR molecules. Because of the low mass con-
tent of water in the crystal structure, the weight loss in the
TGA curve at about 113 °C is nearly unnoticeable. In the
104–250 °C temperature range, the loss of material reaches
32%. The second mass loss takes place in the temperature
range of 250–325 °C.

In the TBR·2HBA cocrystal, the first signal is observed at
around 194 °C and in the TBR·3HBA cocrystal, it is at 223 °C.
At these temperatures, the appropriate monohydroxybenzoic
acids decompose. Since their decomposition temperature is
higher than that of the pure acids (melting temperature of
pure 2HBA – 158 °C and pure 3HBA – 202 °C).42 It can be
concluded that the 2HBA and 3HBA molecules are stabilized
in the cocrystals. At these temperatures, a TBR·2HBA mass
loss of approximately 30% can be observed in the TGA curve
and the TBR·3HBA mass loss is higher and reaches about
45%, respectively. The second DSC signal is related to the
theobromine decomposition.
4. Conclusions
Three
solids
consisting
of
theobromine
and
mono-
hydroxybenzoic acids (ortho, meta and para) were synthe-
sized. Good quality single crystals of TBR·2HBA, TBR·3HBA
and TBR·2Ĳ4HBA)·H2O were obtained by slow evaporation
from solution and were characterized by the single-crystal
X-ray
diffraction
method.
It
allowed
us
to
prove
the
crystallochemical
nature
of
the
new
cocrystals
and
redetermine the TBR·2HBA crystal structure.35 Powder X-ray
diffraction studies confirmed the successful green chemistry
synthesis by grinding in a ball mill. Cocrystallization of theo-
bromine improves its solubility in water approximately 6
times for the TBR·2HBA cocrystal, 5 times for the TBR
·2Ĳ4HBA)·H2O cocrystal hydrate and 3 times for the TBR·3HBA
cocrystal. Additionally thermal analysis confirms the pres-
ence of water molecules in the crystal lattice of TBR·2Ĳ4HBA)
·H2O. In all of the compounds, the acids decompose first,
followed by theobromine.
Structural analysis showed that strong hydrogen bonds
play a key role in the molecular arrangement in the crystal
lattice of the described theobromine derivatives. In this work,
the supramolecular synthons observed in the theobromine
cocrystals with monohydroxybenzoic acids were discussed
and they were also compared to the structural motifs in the-
ophylline and caffeine cocrystals with the same coformers.
Generally, supramolecular heterosynthons are more preferred
than homosynthons.34 Our studies showed that in all of the
investigated
theobromine
cocrystals
with
mono-
hydroxybenzoic acids, the amide–amide homosynthon is
present. Additionally, in the TBR·4HBA·H2O cocrystal hydrate,
the acid–acid homosynthon is formed. In comparison to the
theophylline cocrystals with 2HBA and 3HBA as coformers,
the alkaloid–alkaloid homosynthon (TPH–TPH) is observed.
Caffeine molecules do not form homosynthons and only
heterosynthons are present in their cocrystals with mono-
hydroxybenzoic acids.
The oxygen atoms of the exo- and endo-carbonyl groups
are good proton acceptors. In all of the described alkaloid
complexes with monohydroxybenzoic acids, at least one of
these groups is a proton acceptor from the hydroxyl group or
water molecule in the case of the cocrystal hydrate. The imid-
azole nitrogen atom accepts a proton from the carboxyl group
and only in two cases (TPH·4HBA and TBR·4HBA·H2O) from
the hydroxyl group. In all of the investigated structures, weak
C–H⋯O hydrogen bonds and π-stacking interactions stabilize
the 2D and 3D networks. The knowledge (based on the CSD
data) about theophylline and caffeine cocrystals with mono-
hydroxybenzoic acids allowed us to predict partially which su-
pramolecular synthons would be responsible for the arrange-
ment of theobromine and these acid molecules, when they
form cocrystals.
