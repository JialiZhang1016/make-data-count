In this study ignition of premixed ammonia was tested using a compression-ignited (CI) pilot fuel. n-heptane
(C7H16) was used as pilot fuel, injected with a GDI injector, enabling very small pilot fuel injections. With this
setup, the engine was run using up to 98.5 % energy from ammonia – higher than seen in other CI-engine
studies with ammonia at the time of writing. The ammonia energy contribution was varied 80–98.5 %, while
keeping the total 𝜆-value constant. An important result observed was an increase in combustion efficiency from
81%–90% with higher ammonia energy due to a lower local 𝜆-value of the ammonia–air mixture, indicating
that for ammonia-ignition an easily ignitable ammonia–air mixture is preferable compared to a strong pilot
injection. Lean ammonia–air mixtures showed a gap in heat release between the pilot and ammonia combustion
phases, which lowered the combustion efficiency. Increased ammonia energy led to reduced ammonia-slip and
N2O-emissions and increased NO-emissions, and a lower CO-formation showed better pilot fuel oxidation.
1. Introduction
With the efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions due
to climate change, a focal point has been to replace fossil fuels with
sustainable alternatives in the transport sector. The shipping industry
is responsible for 2%–3% of the world’s total GHG emissions [1],
and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has presented a
goal to reduce the GHG by 50%, compared to 2008-levels, before
2050 [2]. Due to infeasibility of batteries and electric motors for
long-range cargo-ships, sustainable fuels for internal combustion (IC)
engines are investigated heavily at the moment, and ammonia (NH3) is
expected to see significant usage, because there are no CO2-emissions
from combustion of ammonia since it contains no carbon and can be
made using hydrogen from electricity from renewable energy sources.
Ammonia-usage in IC engines for marine purposes have been compared
with fuel-cell usage, and IC engine use was concluded to perform better
in terms of weight, volume, and cost [3]. However, before ammonia can
be used as a main fuel on a large scale, research is needed to reduce
both ammonia-slip, N2O- and NO𝑥-emissions [4].
Spark-ignition (SI) engines have been shown to operate on ammonia
for many years, with important work performed in the 1960’s [5], and
renewed interest has increased the research in recent years. Many SI-
engine studies have used ammonia mixed with hydrogen for improved

combustion stability due to the high flame speed of hydrogen [6–10].
Compared to conventional hydrocarbon combustion, using ammonia
generally yields higher NO- and N2O-emissions. N2O has a global
warming potential of 298 with climate–carbon feedback (265 with-
out) [11], which makes it highly relevant for emission studies. It has
been showed that fuel in crevice volumes was essential for nitrogen-
based emissions [6]. Using ammonia as a fuel for compression-ignition
(CI) engines remains a great challenge due to the high auto-ignition
temperature of ammonia – more than 400 K higher than that of
diesel at atmospheric conditions [12] – meaning that compression
ratios higher than 35:1 are required for ammonia-only CI operation
[13,14]. Other challenges for ammonia-operation is the high heat
of vaporization, which significantly decreases in-cylinder temperature
after injection [15]. Ammonia/air-mixtures also has a low flame speed,
generally around 1/5 of methane/air mixtures [16], and hence large
fuel slips can be observed using ammonia. As mentioned, hydrogen can
be used to increase combustion speed. Due to these challenges, most
studies regarding ammonia in CI engines are dual-fuel operation [12],
often using diesel as a pilot fuel.
Reiter et al. [17] used a dual-fuel configuration with premixed
ammonia and direct-injected diesel and varied the fuel contributions,
first with 10%–45% energy contribution, then later [18] from 0%

(diesel only) to around 80%. Among their key findings were that
small amounts of ammonia energy yielded high brake-specific fuel con-
sumption (BSFC) of ammonia due to very lean ammonia–air mixtures,
while high ammonia energy showed high BSFC of diesel due to low
temperatures. They also found that using small amounts of ammonia
(e.g. 5%–20%) decreases the in-cylinder temperature resulting in de-
creased NO-emissions and increased and CO-emissions, compared to
diesel-only. Larger amounts of ammonia energy (>50%) significantly
increased NO emissions due to fuel-bound nitrogen. However, an-
other study with port-injected aqueous ammonium and direct-injected
diesel [19] showed the opposite trend of Reiter’s results regarding NO-
emissions: as ammonia-contribution was increased from 0% to 10%
energy-contribution, the NO-emissions initially increased due to fuel-
bound nitrogen, while larger amounts of ammonia (to 25%) showed a
decrease in NO due to lower temperatures.
The vapor pressure of ammonia is similar to that of dimethyl ether
(DME), which has a cetane-number higher than that of diesel, and this
makes it attractive to improve the CI combustion properties of ammonia
by mixing it with DME for a single-fuel CI-operation. Gross [20] found
that, compared to 100% DME, the ammonia–DME mixture showed
higher CO- and NO-emissions due to low temperatures and fuel-bound
nitrogen, as well as higher ignition delay and cyclic variations. Another
study [21], also employing a DME–ammonia mixture, with up to 60%
ammonia, showed similar results. With 60% ammonia very early in-
jection (−340 to −90 CAD ATDC) was necessary, which showed HCCI
combustion with very abrupt heat release and high cyclic variations

at low loads due to incomplete combustion. This also dramatically
increased hydrocarbon- and CO-emissions.
A spark-assisted compression ignition (SACI) operation has recently
been shown to run on neat ammonia [22]. SACI uses a spark for early
partial combustion to increase the temperature, enabling compression-
ignition for the main combustion. However, the two phases were not
distinguished, and SI-like operation was obtained.
The presented CI-engine studies with ammonia generally uses up to
80% energy from ammonia, the rest from diesel – only a few results
with higher levels are shown but are discarded due to high brake-
specific fuel consumption [18]. In the longer perspective, a 100%
sustainable fuel supply is desired. In this study, a dual-fuel concept with
premixed ammonia and direct-injected n-heptane (C7H16) was imple-
mented using a Bosch piezo-electric GDI injector for the direct-injected
pilot fuel. This setup was chosen to investigate the possibility of running
a CI-engine with higher ammonia-energy share than previously seen.
The GDI injector allows small, quick injections with rapid atomization
of the pilot fuel. The purpose of the study was to investigate the CI
ignition and combustion processes with very high ammonia energy
contributions.
n-heptane was chosen as pilot fuel due to its low viscosity and
high cetane number. Some representative values of viscosity and cetane
number for both diesel and n-heptane are shown in Table 1. Using a
more viscous pilot fuel make very small injections difficult and yield
larger spray droplets.
2. Methods
Engine tests were performed using ammonia as primary fuel. The
engine setup and the data processing will be briefly presented for both
reproducibility and for discussion purposes.
2.1. Test engine set-up
The engine tests were performed with a BUKH DV 24 ME, a 2-
cylinder compression-ignited diesel engine with a displacement volume
of 964 cm3, a compression ratio of 18 and a maximum power of
17.6 kW from the factory (see Table 2).
One cylinder was unchanged and thus operated normally with
diesel, while the test-cylinder operated on ammonia as described in this

paper. Having a normally operating diesel-cylinder was useful for both
motoring purposes, engine start-up and for altering fuel injection in the
test cylinder without unstable operation.
Pressure in the test-cylinder was measured using a Kistler piezo-
electric pressure pick-up with 10 pressure samples per CAD, controlled
by a shaft encoder. The cylinder pressure was assumed to be equal to
the intake pressure at IVC. The intake pressure was 1.22 ± 0.02 bar
(measured for each test).
All tests were performed with an engine speed of 1200 RPM.
For the test cylinder, gaseous ammonia was aspirated into the
intake manifold, and n-heptane was injected directly into the cylinder
as a pilot fuel to ignite the ammonia–air mixture. n-heptane start of
injection (SOI) was 20 CAD BTDC (except when stated otherwise).
Earlier SOI – e.g. earlier than 50 CAD BTDC – would result in HCCI-like
operation, which was not the purpose of these experiments. As the test
engine was not equipped with a common rail system, the n-heptane
was pressurized in a fuel tank by liquid nitrogen and driven to the
injector, using the fuel pressure, through a mass flow controller. Due
to limitations on the fuel tank, a max. pressure of 120 bars was used.
An illustration of the test engine setup is shown in Fig. 1.
2.1.1. Gas measurements
Emissions of gas species (CO, CO2, NH3, NO and N2O) were mea-
sured using Fourier Transform Infra-Red spectroscopy (FTIR). The FTIR
used for testing was a DX4000 from Gasmet Technologies Oy. Temper-
ature of the sample gas was maintained at 180 ◦C through the FTIR
sample system. A Dekati eDiluter Pro dilution system was applied in
front of the FTIR to ensure sample gas concentrations to be within the
measurement range of the analyzer. The diluter system was equipped
with two dilution stages. The first dilution stage was heated to 180 ◦C
and the second stage was kept at room temperatures. Dry pressurized
air free of particle was used to dilute the sample gas below the dew
point of water vapor. The dilution system includes a build-in compen-
sation of possible fluctuations on the dilution factor due to variations
of the sample gas pressure. The dilution factor was verified by applying
a certified test gas from the inlet of the sample line to the analyzer and
measure the concentration after dilution. A dilution factor of 30 was
used in the test. A multi-component certified test gas covering the IR
spectrum of the FTIR was used to calibrate the analyzer and verify that
no leakage appeared in the sampling system. The test gas was applied
before and after the test to verify and compensate for any detector drift.

2.2. Data processing
For each measurement shown 50 full cycles were measured, and the
average cycle was computed and used for data processing of each mea-
surement. For curve smoothing, the cycle was filtered with a Savitzky–
Golay filter [28]. The location of the top dead center (TDC) was
assumed to be 0.5 CAD after the maximum pressure in the average
motoring cycle due to heat loss and potential blow-by.
Pressure data, along with cylinder volume as a function of crank
angle 𝜃, was used to obtain the fuel-combustion heat release rate ̇𝑄𝐻𝑅,
through Eqs. (2.1) and (2.2):

to the walls, the apparent heat release rate (Eq. (2.1)) takes this into
account. The wall heat transfer –
̇𝑄𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙in Eq. (2.1) – was approxi-
mated using the Woschni correlation for the convective heat transfer
coefficient [29]. For the bulk gas temperature used in the Woschni
correlation, an ideal gas assumption was made, assuming a gas constant

In order to take into account the residual gas in the cylinder, the
temperature at IVC, 𝑇𝐼𝑉𝐶was approximated with Eqs. (2.3) and (2.4):

The residual gas fraction 𝑓was assumed to be 0.05 as it was expected
to realistically be within the range 2%–8%. The sensitivity of this as-
sumption is briefly analyzed in Section 3.1.1. Since 𝑇𝐸𝑉𝑂was needed to
determine 𝑇𝐼𝑉𝐶, an iterative solving method was used for Eqs. (2.3) and
(2.4). The indicated work was evaluated using the measured pressure
data and volume function:

3. Results and discussion
Results from the engine tests will be presented in this section. An
investigation on the ammonia energy share – i.e. the share of fuel
energy supplied by ammonia – is presented in Section 3.1, followed
by an analysis pertaining the intake temperature 𝑇𝑖𝑛in Section 3.2.
During initial tests the SOI was varied with a constant global 𝜆=
1.15 and 78% ammonia energy contribution. The resulting indicated
efficiencies are shown in Fig. 2. It was found that SOI at 20–15 CAD
BTDC yielded best – and very similar – results, as later injection resulted
in poor combustion efficiency due to the long combustion time for
ammonia.

Fig. 4. Ignition delay, defined as SOC - SOI, for the results shown in Fig. 3. Both SOC
for positive heat release rate and CA10 (10% fuel energy released) are shown.
3.1. Variation in ammonia energy share
This section will present results from a variation of ammonia energy
contribution from 80–98.5%.
Fig. 3 shows the heat release rate observed when increasing the
ammonia energy-share from 80% to 98.5% with a constant 𝜆= 1.1, by
decreasing the pilot fuel flow and increasing the ammonia flow. It was
chosen to keep the global 𝜆and SOI constant, and consequently allow
some variation in IMEP with changing energy contributions, because
the purpose of this study was investigating the ignition and combustion
processes. For engine concept feasibility the IMEP should be constant
while using maximum brake torque SOI. The value of 𝜆= 1.1 was
chosen from initial studies showing high indicated efficiencies at this
value.
SOI at 20 CAD BTDC was chosen from the results in Fig. 2. The
ignition delays are shown in Fig. 4. Both the delays for positive heat
release rate and CA10 (CAD for 10% of fuel energy released) are shown,
both in CAD after SOI.
With 80% ammonia energy, a brief initial peak in heat release rate
can be identified before a longer and slightly lower heat release rate
takes place. The initial peak is most likely combustion of pilot fuel,
while the longer and lower heat release rate is ammonia combustion. As
the ammonia energy is increased – and the pilot fuel is correspondingly
decreased – the initial peak decreases, as should be expected, and the
ammonia combustion is seen to reach higher heat release rates. While
the 80% NH3 shows a relatively sustained heat release rate, the higher
NH3 amounts lead to higher peak HRR sustained for a shorter time.

Fig. 5. Integrated heat release curves with increasing ammonia energy and constant
𝜆= 1.1, normalized by the total fuel energy and shifted to begin combustion from 0
heat released.
This likely due to less ammonia fuel leading to a leaner ammonia–air
mixture which inhibits the burning rate of the mixture. The pilot fuel
combustion products may also act as inert gases during the ammonia
combustion.
The initial investigation of SOI with 78% ammonia energy (Fig. 2)
showed a trade-off between high compression work with early injection
or low combustion efficiency with late injection, limiting the obtainable
indicated efficiency. This can be identified in the gap between the
pilot and ammonia combustion phases with 80% ammonia in Fig. 3.
However, the 98% ammonia case shows a reduction of this trade-off
since there is no gap between the fuel combustion phases and the
maximum burning rate is higher. The potential for a large heat release
close to TDC thus increases the obtainable indicated efficiency.
Fig. 4 shows that increased ammonia energy generally increases
the ignition delay. This might be explained by the ammonia inhibiting
the oxidation of the pilot fuel. As the ammonia-energy increases, the
concentration of ammonia in the ammonia–air mixture increases. It is
unclear to what extent the pilot fuel combustion products act as inert
gases during the ammonia combustion.
The corresponding integrated heat releases are shown in Fig. 5,
normalized by the total fuel energy and plotted to EVO. Note that
these have been shifted to accommodate the heat for fuel vaporization.
Important results from Fig. 5 are that more ammonia energy seem
to yield more complete combustion, but all cases lead to incomplete
combustion. A significant fuel amount is combusted very late in the
expansion stroke, decreasing the generated work and hence indicated
efficiency. Thus, to increase the indicated efficiency the combustion
speed should be increased. The ammonia slip is shown in Fig. 6,
where it is observed that the ammonia slip decreases when the amount
of ammonia is increased, even in spite of the expected increase in
ammonia in crevice volumes, clearly indicating an improved ammonia
combustion efficiency. The combustion efficiency, 𝜂𝑐, also increases
with higher ammonia energy share.
The increasing combustion efficiency with higher ammonia energy
is believed by the authors to be a result of differences in local 𝜆-
values. A higher amount of energy from ammonia means that the local
air-excess ratio of the ammonia–air mixture, 𝜆𝑁𝐻3, decreases towards
stoichiometric, making the mixture easier to ignite. Conversely, less
energy from ammonia will leave more of the oxygen in the ammonia–
air mixture for the pilot fuel, and the ammonia–air mixture will have
a high local 𝜆-value, making it less easily ignited and decreasing the
flame speed. Table 4 shows the ammonia–air mixture 𝜆-values, 𝜆𝑁𝐻3,
for the results in Figs. 3–6. The higher 𝜆𝑁𝐻3 from increased ammonia-
energy leads to higher flame speeds, as the laminar flame speed is
generally highest around 𝜙= 1.1, or 𝜆= 0.91 [16,30].

Fig. 7. CO-share of total carbon-based emissions (CO and CO2):

fuel combustion is more rich with higher pilot fuel energy even though the total 𝜆is
unchanged.
Increasing the pilot fuel energy contribution will naturally increase
the oxygen required for pilot fuel combustion while increasing the
oxygen-concentration in the ammonia–air mixture. Fig. 7 shows that
the CO-emissions, relative to the total carbon-based emissions (CO and
CO2), decrease with increasing ammonia-energy. The pilot fuel exhibits
a similar but opposite issue of the ammonia–air mixture; more pilot fuel
decreases the local 𝜆-value at the spray to richer combustion, resulting
in higher CO-formation. The substantial amounts of CO at 80%–89%
ammonia-energy clearly shows a great disadvantage of the GDI injector:
as a large amount of direct-injected pilot fuel is sprayed very quickly,
a dense fuel ‘cloud’ is formed which is not easily oxidized while
the temperature conditions allow fuel cracking, resulting in high CO-
formation. Fig. 8 shows a graphical illustration of this expected cause
of the poor combustion observed with 80%–89% ammonia-energy.
As mentioned earlier, it was chosen to keep the global 𝜆constant
in this analysis, and not the IMEP, to keep the combustion conditions
comparable instead of the engine conditions. The resulting variation in
IMEP, as well as Coefficient of Variation (CoV), are presented in Fig. 9.
The IMEP increases slightly with the ammonia energy contribution,
albeit this could be due to the increased combustion efficiency.

5, 6 and 7 with a significant pilot fuel amount. A higher energy share from pilot fuel
occupy more of the oxygen in the cylinder for pilot fuel combustion, and as a result,
the ammonia–air mixture becomes lean while the pilot fuel combustion becomes rich.
Fig. 9. IMEP [bar] and CoV(IMEP) [%] for different NH3 energy contributions, with
a constant global 𝜆= 1.1.
The CoV(IMEP) shows that the engine operation was very stable for
all the investigated cases, with the higher levels of ammonia-energy
reaching less than 1% CoV.
Emissions of NO and nitrous oxide (N2O) are shown in Fig. 10. The
NO-emissions are seen to increase quite linearly with the ammonia en-
ergy, which might simply be understood as a larger NO-formation from
fuel-bound nitrogen due to the higher amount of ammonia. Thermal
NO-formation might also increase due to the longer ignition delays with
higher ammonia energy increasing the peak temperature.
N2O-formation from Thermal DeNOx has been shown to occur
mainly from 2 reactions, one dominating at low levels of O2 (0%–
1%) while occurring during high temperatures (Reaction (3.1)) and one
dominating at higher levels of O2 (from 4%) occurring during lower
temperatures (Reaction (3.2)) [31,32] .
NH + NO ⇌N2O + H
(3.1)
NH2 + NO2 ⇌N2O + H2O
(3.2)
It has been proposed that in ammonia-burning combustion engines
the N2O-formation mainly occurs from the low-temperature reaction
during the expansion stroke as NH3 from crevices is converted to NH2
which reacts with NO2 [6]. This could imply that NH3 emissions from
crevice volumes and N2O-emissions can be correlated, which is found
to be the case in Figs. 6 and 10.

(98.5%) was below the readable range and hence is not shown.
Fig. 11. Sensitivity of the wall heat loss – normalized with fuel-energy – to the residual
gas amount 𝑓(see Eq. (2.3)). The lower limit is 𝑓= 0.02, the higher limit is 𝑓= 0.08,
and the stippled line shows the value used for all other results (𝑓= 0.05).
3.1.1. Results discussion
For the presented results the residual gas fraction was assumed to
be 𝑓= 0.05. Higher residual gas fraction increases the temperature at
IVC and thus the heat loss through the walls. The sensitivity of the
wall heat transfer to 𝑓is presented in Fig. 11. The wall heat loss is
shown normalized with the fuel energy to present the impact of 𝑓on
the fraction of fuel energy lost through heat transfer. The range shows 𝑓
in the range 0.02–0.08. This was chosen since the residual gas fraction
is generally very low in CI engines due to the high compression ratios
[33,34].
Compared to the case with 𝑓= 0.05, the heat loss energy fraction
– for the investigated range of 𝑓– is generally around −5%, or −1.1
percentage points (pp), for 𝑓= 0.02, and + 5.6%, or + 1.3 pp, for
𝑓= 0.08.
The integrated heat release (Fig. 5) and the combustion efficiency
(Fig. 6) presented earlier matched very well for the cases with 80%–
89% ammonia energy. However, 95%–98% NH3-cases showed higher
integrated heat release than the combustion efficiencies. This tendency
is also showed in Fig. 12, which shows fuel energy and resulting energy
distributions for varying ammonia energy contribution. For 80%–89%
ammonia energy, the energy distribution matches the fuel energy very
well, while the cases with 95%–98% ammonia energy shows higher
total energy distribution than the fuel energy, which clearly breaks
the first law of thermodynamics. This is likely partly because the heat
loss is over-estimated in these cases, leading to higher heat release,
since the heat transfer approximation is probably the greatest source
of uncertainty.

3.2. Intake preheating
Due to the general issues with igniting ammonia and achieving
complete combustion, it was expected by the authors that higher intake
temperature might result in more complete combustion. For this reason
the impact of the intake temperature on the combustion efficiency was
studied. Intake ammonia/air-mixture temperatures (𝑇𝑖𝑛) of 40 ◦C and
80 ◦C were used while varying start of injection (SOI), 𝜆and ammonia
energy contribution.
Fig. 13 shows the heat release rates for the studied cases, while
Fig. 14 shows the resulting combustion efficiencies.
Fig. 14. Combustion efficiency (𝜂𝑐) vs intake temperature (𝑇𝑖𝑛) with parameter
variations, related to the heat release rates in Fig. 13.
Generally the heat release rate traces show that intake temperature
of 40 ◦C yield a slightly longer ignition delay than 80 ◦C, resulting in
a higher peak heat release rate due to more pilot fuel mixing time.
Advancing the SOI from 20 to 30 CAD BTDC (the two top graphs in
Fig. 13) shows a significantly higher peak heat release rate, most likely
also caused by more mixing of the pilot fuel. The later SOI (at 20 CAD
BTDC) shows a drop in the heat release rate, effectively dividing the
pilot fuel and ammonia combustion phases, while the increased mixing
from earlier injection allows the pilot fuel to more effectively start the
ammonia combustion, yielding no gap between the two. The related
combustion efficiencies in Fig. 14 – denoted as ‘SOI = -20 CAD’ and
‘SOI = -30 CAD’ – show that increased intake temperature increases
improves the combustion with early injection but has only very little
impact with the later injection.
Increasing the global air excess ratio 𝜆from 1.1 to 1.3 – i.e.
comparing the two bottom graphs in Fig. 13 – shows a gap appear
between the pilot fuel and ammonia combustion phases, similarly to the
case with 80% ammonia in Fig. 3. This clearly shows that the ammonia
is less easily ignited by the pilot fuel due to the leaner ammonia/air
mixture and the smaller pilot fuel injection. Furthermore, increasing
the intake temperature from 40 ◦C to 80 ◦C enhances this gap due to
the decreased ignition delay, and very poor ammonia combustion is
observed as a result. This is observed in Fig. 14 – denoted ‘𝜆= 1.3,
95% NH3’ – to be the only case where increased intake temperature
decreases the combustion efficiency. The combustion efficiency with
95% NH3 and 𝜆= 1.1 – denoted ‘95% NH3’ – shows no dependence on
the intake temperature.
The IMEP of the results are shown in Table 5 along with the
CoV(IMEP) in parentheses. The IMEP is lower with 𝑇𝑖𝑛= 80 ◦C than
with 40 ◦C – despite the generally higher combustion efficiency with
higher – mainly because equal pilot fuel injection timing was used
instead of maximum brake torque (MBT) timing. This results in greater
compression stroke work with higher intake temperature due to the ear-
lier ignition. Equal injection timing was chosen to ensure injection into
similar conditions of temperature and pressure. Additionally, the higher
intake temperature reduces the intake density and thus reduces the
fuel injection for a constant 𝜆, also reducing the IMEP. The CoV(IMEP)
generally decreases slightly with higher intake temperature, due to
slightly higher combustion efficiency.
4. Conclusion
This paper reports tests on a CI-engine using premixed ammonia and
direct-injected n-heptane as pilot fuel. By using a GDI nozzle very small
amounts of pilot fuel could be used successfully. Energy contribution

from ammonia was varied in the range 80–98.5% of the injected fuel
energy. An important result observed was higher combustion efficiency
with increased ammonia energy contribution due to a leaner ammonia–
air mixture. Increased values of 𝜆𝑁𝐻3 – the 𝜆-value of the ammonia–air
mixture for ammonia combustion – showed a gap in heat release rate
between the pilot and ammonia combustion phases due to difficulties in
igniting the lean mixture. Lower values of 𝜆𝑁𝐻3 – e.g. from lower total
𝜆or increased ammonia energy contribution – showed no gap between
the combustion phases and showed higher peak heat release rate of
ammonia. This should allow more heat release close to TDC and thus
increase the obtainable indicated efficiency.
The NH3-emissions were reduced with higher ammonia-content due
to higher combustion efficiency, despite the expected increased amount
of ammonia in crevice volumes. The N2O-emissions also decreased with
higher ammonia energy, while NO-emissions increased.
The effect of intake temperature on the combustion efficiency was
investigated with two values of start of injection (SOI), total 𝜆, and
ammonia energy. Increased intake temperature yielded shorter ignition
delay for all cases. The cases with SOI = 20 CAD BTDC and 𝜆= 1.1
showed little to no effect of intake temperature on the combustion
efficiency. SOI = 30 CAD BTDC showed increased combustion efficiency
with higher intake temperature, while 𝜆= 1.3 showed a significantly
lower combustion efficiency as the decreased ignition delay showed an
increased gap between the combustion phases.
