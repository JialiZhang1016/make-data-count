Abstract
We present a statistical study of 219 ICMEs measured by both ACE and WIND from 1998 to 2011. ICME plasmas
are deﬁned as possessing cold materials if the carbon average charge states are lower than those of the preceding
solar wind by three standard deviations and the carbon ionic temperature is lower than 106.05 K. A total of 69
ICMEs were identiﬁed as containing cold materials. These ICMEs tend to have speeds in the range of
300–600km s−1, with durations between 2 and 6hr. Cold materials tend to be present once or twice per ICME.
We further identify two special types of cold materials: the ionic-cold type (IC) shows simultaneous lower average
charge states of O, Mg, Si, and Fe ions than those of the preceding solar wind, while the carbon-only cold type
(COC) shows a totally opposite trend in that these ions show higher average charge than in the preceding solar
wind. We found that the IC has a higher proton temperature than the ICME mean value, whereas the COC has a
lower proton temperature than the ICME mean value, and the COC is most often measured in magnetic cloud. A
detailed examination of the IC and the COC material suggests that they are related to solar ﬁlaments. Their special
mean charge indicates that the ﬁlaments are a mixture of coronal and choromospheric materials. Heating and
collision processes beyond the carbon freeze-in height are crucial in generating the two distinct types.

1. Introduction
Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are some of the most severe
explosive phenomena in the heliosphere. They have been routinely
observed by coronagraphs since the 1970s (Hundhausen et al.
1984; Schwenn et al. 2006). It is well known that halo CMEs can
cause geomagnetic storms. Typically, CMEs have a three-part
structure: the bright core, the dark cavity, and the bright front. The
bright core is supposed to be the eruptive ﬁlament, the dark cavity
is the ﬂux rope, and the bright front is where the plasmas pile up
(Hudson et al. 2006; Wimmer-Schweingruber et al. 2006; Reeves
et al. 2015). When CMEs propagate into the interplanetary space,
their counterparts measured in situ are called interplanetary coronal
mass ejections (ICMEs; Zurbuchen & Richardson 2006). If ICMEs
have enhanced magnetic ﬁeld strength and smoothly rotating
magnetic ﬁeld, they are classiﬁed as magnetic clouds (MCs;
Burlaga et al. 1981).
In the past 40 years, researchers have attempted to learn more
about plasma features and the acceleration process of CMEs from
in situ measurements (Cane & Richardson 2003; Richardson &
Cane 2010; Howard 2015a, 2015b; Wood et al. 2016). Many
works reported the identiﬁcation of the plasma pileup and ﬂux
rope structures. However, cold and dense ﬁlaments have been
seldom reported from in situ measurements. Usually, it is
believed that the solar ﬁlament materials come from the
chromosphere (Forbes 2000; Yan et al. 2013, 2016). Such
materials should show a lower proton temperature, higher proton
density, a higher alpha to proton ratio, and lower charge state ions
(Priest 1988). According to these criteria, Schwenn et al. (1980),
Wurz et al. (1998), Burlaga et al. (1998), Gloeckler et al. (1999),
Gopalswamy et al. (1998), Lepri & Zurbuchen (2010), Yao et al.
(2010), and Song et al. (2016) identiﬁed over 10 ICME events
from 1976 to 2009 that likely contained ﬁlament materials.
Clearly, this number is far less than the number of observed
three-part CMEs (Gopalswamy 2006; McCauley et al. 2015).
Recently, Song et al. (2016) and Song et al. (2017) analyzed the
average ion charge state of Fe inside the ICMEs and conﬁrmed
that some cold materials in the ICMEs may not be related to the
prominence in the solar atmosphere. A natural problem that arises
from these studies concerns what happens to the prominence/
ﬁlament during the initiation of the CMEs and what is the nature
of the cold material in the ICMEs measured in situ. As an attempt
to solve these problems, we perform a statistical analysis of all
the ICMEs measured by both the WIND and ACE spacecraft
from 1998 to 2011 with a focus on cold materials. By combining
the ion average charge of C, O, Mg, Si, and Fe; proton and α
particle moments; and solar observations; we examine the
features of the cold materials in the ICMEs. The data and the
criteria used to identify the cold materials are described in
Section 2. The statistical results of the cold materials in the
ICMEs are shown in Section 3. Constraints on possible physical
processes as revealed by the presence of these cold materials are
discussed in Section 4.
2. Data and Criteria
We used the magnetic ﬁeld, proton temperature, proton
speed, and ion charge state distributions measured by the ACE

spacecraft from 1998 to 2011. The magnetic ﬁeld magnitude and
its components in the Geocentric Solar Ecliptic (GSE) coordinate
system are provided by the MFI every 16s(Smith et al. 1998).
The normalized ion charge distributions of C, O, Mg, Si, and Fe
are published with a cadence of one hour by SWICS(Gloeckler
et al. 1998), and the plasma moments are provided with a
cadence of 64s by SWEPAM(McComas et al. 1998). All the
ion charge state data is provided by the ACE Science Center. To
minimize the effect of instrument errors and to help better
identify the MC, this work also uses WIND data, including the
3s magnetic ﬁeld magnitude provided by MFI(Lepping et al.
1995), the 92s cadence proton density Np and α particle density
Nα provided by SWE(Ogilvie et al. 1995) and the 3s cadence
proton temperature Tp provided by 3DP(Lin et al. 1995). The
CME images observed by LASCO and UVCS on board
SOHO(Dere et al. 1997) available at http://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.
gov/CME_list/ are used to analyze the initial structures of the
ICMEs detected between 1998 February and 2005 August
(Giordano et al. 2013). Since UVCS on board SOHO ceased to
work in September 2005, STEREO is the only spacecraft
offering continuous Halo CME observations in which the core
part could be clearly identiﬁed from 2007 to 2011. After 2007
April, the CME movies observed by SECCHI and EUVI on
board STEREO available at https://secchi.nrl.navy.mil/cactus
are used(Aschwanden et al. 2009).
The ICME list used in this work is given by Cane &
Richardson (2003); Richardson & Cane (2010), and by the
ACE Science Centerhttp://www.srl.caltech.edu/ACE/ASC/
DATA/level3. Of all 319 ICME events from 1998 February to
2011 August, when the SWICS data is available, 219 events
were detected by both the WIND and ACE spacecraft, together
with the 24 hr of solar wind before them. For this analysis, we
required data gaps in the ionic charge states to be shorter than
12 hr in the preceding solar wind and 2 hr in ICME periods, as
well as shorter than 6 times the sampling cadence for other
plasma parameters. The detailed ICME event list is shown in
Table 6 in the Appendix. All the times of the shock and ICME
leading and trailing edges are shown with respect to ACE time.
The shock time is used to determine the 24 hr solar wind
preceding the ICME. The mean value of all the statistics is
calculated from the ICME leading edge to trailing edge. To
examine whether the ICMEs are MCs, we used the criterion
given by Burlaga et al. (1981). Speciﬁcally, an ICME is
identiﬁed as an MC if the magnetic ﬁeld magnitude is enhanced
stably and the magnetic ﬁeld vector rotates smoothly for a large
angle. To avoid subjective judgment, we quantiﬁed the
criterion as follows: the maximum magnetic ﬁeld magnitude
of the ICME is stronger than that of the ICME sheath, the
elevation angle of the magnetic ﬁeld changes by at least 50°
over more than 8 hr, and the ﬂuctuations of the magnetic ﬁeld
elevation angle θ are less than 50% of the θmax−θmin in
the ICME.
In all analyzed 219 ICME events, there are 99 MCs. Since
we focused on the nature of the cold materials in the ICMEs,
we analyzed not only the ion charge state but also the proton
temperature Tp, the proton density Np, the proton velocity Vp,
the alpha particle density Nα, and the alpha to proton density
ratio, R

The carbon ions have a freezing in height between 1 and
1.2Rs, which is lower than that of the O, Mg, Si, and Fe ions
(Geiss et al. 1995; Kocher et al. 2017). Consequently, the charge
of the carbon ions is the least affected by the heating and
collisions associated with the CME initiation. We used the
following two criteria to identify cold material in ICMEs.
(1) The mean carbon charge state in the carbon-cold (CC) period
is at least three standard deviations lower than that of the 24 hr
solar wind preceding the ICME. The standard deviation is
calculated in the preceding 24 hr of solar wind. (2) The carbon
ionic temperature satisﬁes T

K. This critical
temperature was derived by binning all preceding solar wind
periods into six velocity bins with 50km s−1 bin widths centered
around 325–575km s−1 and one bin for v>600 km s−1. We
then calculated the expected mean carbon ionic temperature
according to the statistical relation between solar wind speed and
carbon freeze-in temperature given in Kasper et al. (2012). For
the solar wind periods with speeds exceeding 600 km s−1, we
used TC=105.988 K as given by Landi et al. (2014) who
analyzed fast (v > 500 km s−1) solar wind measured by Ulysses
from 1994 to 1998 (Gloeckler & Geiss 2007). We computed the
weighted average of these temperatures using the number of
occurrences per velocity bin as weights and found Tcrit=106.05 K.
The ionic temperatures were derived from their mean charge state
(as provided by the ACE Science Center) using the CHIANTI
database version 8 (Dere et al. 1997; Del Zanna et al. 2015).
Because ICMEs can follow each other with less than 24 hr
separation, we used the 24 hr of solar wind preceding the ﬁrst
ICME if multiple ICMEs occur. The criterion can be expressed as

and TC<106.05 K. In addition, this
ionic temperature corresponds to a mean carbon charge of 5.1336.
The symbol σ is the charge state standard deviation of the 24 hr
solar wind preceding the ICME. To avoid errors and uncertainties
from charge state measurements, a single data point meeting the
criteria was not considered in this work. Consequently, we
considered a time period containing at least two SWICS data
points, which is at least one hour long in between.
3. Statistical Results
We identiﬁed 108 segments in 69 ICMEs that contain CC
material. Of the 69 ICMEs, 38 are MCs. We also examined the
mean charge states of the O, Mg, Si, and Fe ions in the time
periods containing cold material. The ionic temperature of C,
O, Mg, Si, and Fe ions of the 108 CC segments are shown in
Table 7 in the Appendix. It is very interesting that there are two
extreme cases. The ﬁrst one has mean charge states of all the O,
Mg, Si, and Fe ions that are lower than those in the preceding
24 hr of solar wind. The other one has mean charge states of all
the O, Mg, Si, and Fe ions that are 3σ higher than those in the
preceding 24 hr of solar wind. We named the ﬁrst case ionic-
cold (IC) material and the other case carbon-only cold (COC)
material. Among all the 108 CC segments, we classiﬁed 6
segments as IC and 15 segments as COC. An ICME containing
IC material is shown as an example in Figure 1. From the
ﬁgure, we can see that the carbon mean charge state falls below

similar to that shown in Figure 1.

wind mean charge state plus three standard deviations of the
preceding 24 hr solar wind. Meanwhile, the mean proton
temperature measured by ACE and WIND is lower than that of
the CC ICMEs. All of the 15 COC segments except one have a

from 13 ICMEs are listed in Table 2. It is remarkable that 13 of
the 15 COC time periods are identiﬁed inside 11 MCs.
Next, we examined various statistics of the 108 CC segments
in Figure 3. The histograms of the segments numbers per
ICME, of the duration of the segment, and of the proton speed
in each segment are plotted. From panel (a), we can see from
the ﬁgure that most of ICMEs contain one or two cold
segments. Only a few of them have more than two segments.
The largest number of segments in one ICME is ﬁve. Panel (b)
shows the distribution of the duration of segments. The most
probable value of the duration is 2hr and most periods are
shorter than 10 hr. Nevertheless, there are a few periods that are
as long as 37 hr. Panel (c) shows that the bulk solar wind speed
in the CC segments lies predominantly between 300 and
600km s−1, although there are a few faster segments.
Furthermore, we plotted the ratio of O, Mg, Si, and Fe mean
charge states in the CC segments and the preceding 24 hr of
solar wind versus their corresponding mean carbon charge
states in Figure 4. It is by construction that all the IC segments
have mean charge state ratios Q

for all investigated elements: O,
Mg, Si, and Fe. The two types are located on the top part and
bottom part of the distribution, respectively. The IC segments
tend to be carbon colder, but the difference between IC and
COC segments may be mainly due to the outlier at Q

.
Thus, we performed a signiﬁcance test on our classiﬁcation
of IC and COC type in the CC class. As we introduced
previously, IC type was deﬁned by its lower carbon mean
charge and lower mean charge of O, Mg, Si, and Fe than the
preceding solar wind, while COC type was deﬁned by its lower
carbon mean charge and higher mean charge of O, Mg, Si, and
Fe. The tests are on the carbon ionic temperature and are
performed to the three types of period: (1) CC, (2) IC, and
(3) COC. Note that the CC type is the mother type, and IC type
and COC type are two daughter types. Our null hypothesis is
that the two distributions are the same. The test results are
shown in Figure 5. The p values are 0.11, 0.43, and 0.06 for the
three pairs: CC and IC, CC and COC, and IC and COC,
respectively. Since we chose a signiﬁcance level of 10%, the p-
value less than 0.1 means the null hypothesis can be rejected at
the 10% signiﬁcance level. Clearly, the two daughter types are
similar to their mother type (as seen by the p value of 0.11 and
0.43). However, the two daughter types, having a p value of
0.06, are very different. Indeed, as shown in Figure 5, the
distributions of IC and COC cover different ionic temperature
range and have little in common. These may suggest that these
two types of cold material have different forming mechanisms.
Moreover, we investigated the relation between the ratios of
average O, Mg, Si, and Fe average charge states to C average
charge state and the bulk solar wind speed measured during CC

periods, and found no distinction between the IC and the COC
types. Since O, Mg, Si, and Fe ions have the same variation
trend in the IC and COC segments, we examined the
correlation between the mean charge state of O and those of
Mg, Si, and Fe ions. The results are shown in Figure 6. It is
obvious that the mean charge of C is uncorrelated to that of O,
shown in subgraph (a). From subgraph (b) and (c), we found
very good correlations between the mean charge states of Mg
(Si) ions to that of O ions for both types of segments. The
subgraph (d) shows the mean charge states of Fe ions to that of
O ions. The Fe–O correlation is less signiﬁcant than the
Mg (Si).
To further understand the nature of cold materials, we
calculated the CME launch time Tearly and Tlate from the in situ
measured ICME maximum and minimum velocities. The velocity
information is given in the ﬁrst appendix table. Considering the
velocity variation during the CME initiation, we deﬁned the CME
start time range as [Tearly−12 hr, Tlate+12 hr]. According to this
CME start time range, we checked the SOHO and STEREO
CME lists. We identiﬁed all the CMEs having an angular width of

larger than 120° as Halo CMEs because Shen et al. (2014)
reported that these CMEs have greater probability of hitting Earth
and thus ACE and WIND than others. If there is more than one
Halo CME in the start time range, we chose the Halo CME having
the largest angular width. We identiﬁed the core part of the CMEs
from 1998 February to 2005 August using UVCS on SOHO(-
Giordano et al. 2013). For the CMEs occurring after 2007 April,
we checked the observations from SECCHI and EUVI on
STEREO. The CME counterparts of the 18 ICME events
containing IC and COC materials are listed in Table 3. Because
UVCS stopped working in 2005 September and STEREO only
began observations in 2007 April, we could not determine
whether CMEs had bright cores if they were observed between
2005 September and 2007 March. Thus, we marked them as
unknown (U). The information of all the 69 CC ICMEs are shown
in Table 8 in the Appendix. There are 54 ICMEs containing CC
material related to Halo CMEs and 18 of these 54 CMEs have a
bright core inside. It is interesting to note that all COC events
occurred before 2006, and all but one of the IC events occurred
after 2006. In Table 3, no data (ND) means no solar observations
from SOHO/LASCO, and no report (NR) means SOHO LASCO
and UVCS do not report such phenomenon though the data are
available.
To reveal more features of the cold materials and to compare
them with the ﬁlaments, we studied various plasma parameters
of the cold materials. Thus, Table 3 also includes the Tp, Np,
Nα, and R p
a (Nα/Np) for both IC and COC segments compared
with their mean value of each ICME. The mean values of Tp,
Np, Nα, and R p
a in CC period and those in ICME are given in
Table 8 in the Appendix. The comparison results of the three
classes: CC, IC, and COC, are summarized in Table 4. It could
be seen that the proton temperature for the IC segments and the
COC segments have almost opposite trends. Furthermore, all
cold materials tend to have higher R

and except IC
segments, they tend to have lower proton temperatures as well.
Previously, Lepri & Zurbuchen (2010) reported the existence
of cold ﬁlament materials in ICMEs. To deﬁne the cold
ﬁlament materials, they used a combination of the charge states
of the C, O, and Fe ions. Speciﬁcally, they deﬁned the
following: if C2 ,3

corresponding plasmas are considered predominantly cold
materials. In our study, we employed a different criterion for
the identiﬁcation of cold materials. Since the ICME events that
we used in this study signiﬁcantly overlap with Lepri &
Zurbuchen (2010), we can compare our results with those
studied by Lepri & Zurbuchen (2010). This comparison is
presented in Table 5. A total of 11 cold ﬁlaments in 10 ICMEs
were identiﬁed in Lepri & Zurbuchen (2010). The serial
numbers of the 11 periods in Lepri & Zurbuchen (2010) and in
our study are given in Table 5 as SN(L) and SN. Out of the 11
(Lepri & Zurbuchen 2010) cold material periods, 8 meet our
deﬁnition of CC materials. Note that 3 of Lepri & Zurbuchen
(2010) periods contain only a single data point for the carbon
mean charge meeting the requirement on cold materials,
marked by S. We noticed that 1 out of the 8 CC periods
contains COC materials, and no periods contain IC materials.
Note that the ICMEs reported by Lepri & Zurbuchen (2010)
containing SN(L) 6, SN(L) 7, and SN(L) 9 cold material
periods are not in our 219 ICME list, and are marked by “–” in
Table 5. This is because our selection criteria require
simultaneous measurements of ICMEs by both ACE and
WIND as well as measurement of the solar wind within 24 hr
prior to the ICMEs. For the ICMEs in Table 5, although
the ICME events identiﬁed in both studies are the same, the
duration of the segments differs, as they are identiﬁed by the
two different criteria, as explained above. In addition, there are
CMEs and ﬁlaments related to the SN(L) 4 and SN(L) 5 cold
material periods in Lepri & Zurbuchen (2010). But in our study
we found a Halo CME related to SN(L) 4 and no Halo CME
related to SN(L) 5. Since we deﬁned the range of CME start
time using the in situ measured speed, we only checked the
CME record in the deﬁned time range. Beside, there is NR of
eruptive prominence in the CME related to SN(L) 4 in our
study.
Finally, we examined the solar cycle dependence of these
cold material appearances. The results are shown in Figure 7.
ICMEs are often classiﬁed into MCs and nonmagnetic-cloud
ICMEs (non-MC). In our study, depending on if there are cold
materials present, we further classiﬁed MC and non-MC into
cold material ICMEs (CC ICMEs) and non-cold material
ICMEs (non-CC ICMEs). Thus, a total of four types of ICMEs
are shown in Figure 7. The blue bar indicates MCs with cold

materials, the orange bar indicates MCs without cold materials,
the gray bar indicates non-MCs with cold materials, and the
yellow bar indicates non-MCs without cold materials. Clearly,
cold materials can appear in both MC and nonmagnetic-cloud
ICMEs. Furthermore, the number of ICMEs containing cold
materials represented by the blue and gray bars, is higher from
1998 to 2002 than from 2006 to 2011. The black and white
cross symbols indicate the occurrence of ICMEs containing IC
and COC materials, respectively. This suggests some solar
activity dependence for the presence of cold materials. The
fraction of MCs and CC ICMEs of each year are shown in

CME number observed by SOHO/LASCO and yearly averaged
sunspot number recorded by the Royal Observatory of Belgium. It
is obvious that the two plots have different variation trends.
According to Wang & Colaninno (2014), the high CME number
after mid-2010 is an artifact caused by identiﬁcation of “very poor”
eruptions and by LASCO image cadence. After calibration in
Wang & Colaninno (2014), the SOHO/LASCO CME number
shows a similar trend to sunspot number.
4. Discussion
In this study, we examined 219 ICME events detected by
both the ACE and WIND spacecraft from 1998 to 2011. Using a
criterion based solely on the average carbon charge state, we
identiﬁed CC material in 69 of these ICMEs. Our results are
summarized in the following text and in Figure 8. First, 69 of
the 219 studied ICMEs contain cold material as deﬁned by the
criteria discussed in Section 2. Of these ICMEs, 38 are MCs.
Only 18 out of 69 CC ICMEs can be conﬁrmed to have clear
three-part CME counterparts. Of these 18 events, 4 events have
been previously reported by Lepri & Zurbuchen (2010).
Second, the most probable duration of the segments during
which the cold material is present is 2hr, while approximately
80% of the segments last for less than 10hr. The 69 CC ICMEs
typically have one or two CC segments, rarely more than that.
Third, the bulk solar wind proton speed for these segments
typically lies between 300 and 600km s−1. In addition,
segments containing cold materials tend to have a lower proton
temperature, and higher Rαp comparing to their corresponding
ICMEs. Fourth, we have identiﬁed two extreme populations for
the periods that contain cold materials, one is the IC type and
the other is the COC type. Ionic-cold type (6/108) has
simultaneously lower average charge states of C, O, Mg, Si,
and Fe than that of the 24 hr of solar wind preceding to the
ICMEs (at 3σ-level). In comparison, COC type (15/108) has
carbon being cold, but O, Mg, Si, and Fe are 3σ hotter than the
preceding solar wind. We noticed that 11 of 13 ICMEs
containing COC material are MCs, and 4 of 5 ICMEs
containing IC material are non-MCs. To test if the appearance
of COC and IC material in MC or non-MC is statistically

magnetic cloud without cold material (MC and non-CC), nonmagnetic cloud with cold material (non-MC and CC), and nonmagnetic cloud without cold material (non-
MC and non-CC). The horizontal axis is the year, which ranges from 1998 to 2011. The panel (a) shows the number of ICME events. In each year, the histogram of
each of the four types of ICMEs is shown. In panel (b) the black line and the red line indicate the percentage of MCs and carbon-cold ICMEs, respectively. And panel
(c) shows the yearly total CME number observed by SOHO/LASCO (left Y-axis) and the yearly mean sunspot number recorded by Royal Observatory of Belgium
(right Y-axis).

signiﬁcant or not, we made the following hypothesis. We
assumed that the COC were randomly distributed in all 219
studied ICMEs. Considering 99 of 219 ICMEs are MCs, so the
probability that 11 of 13 ICMEs containing COC material are
MCs is C
C
C

219
99 = 0.003. The very small probability
means the null hypothesis should be rejected. Besides, we
made Z-test on COC appearance ratios of the MC (11/99) and
non-MC (2/120) groups, assuming the appearance probability
of the two groups is the same. The Z value is 2.94 larger than
the critical value for 95% conﬁdence Z0.05=1.645. It means
that the null hypothesis should be rejected. Thus, the COC
material is not randomly distributed in 219 ICMEs, and its
appearance in MCs has strong statistical signiﬁcance. Next, we
made the same hypothesis on IC material. The probability that
4 of 5 ICMEs containing IC material are non-MCs is 0.203,
and the Z value is 1.14. It means the appearance of IC material
may not be random, and its appearance in non-MCs is not very
signiﬁcant. We supposed that this weak result of IC is caused
by the small number of IC samples.
We also noted that the IC material shows a higher proton
temperature, and the COC material shows a lower proton
temperature. Finally, there are four ICMEs containing cold
material identiﬁed by both Lepri & Zurbuchen (2010) and our
study. Only one of four, SN(L)4 or SN24, is classiﬁed as a
COC type. This is due to the fact that the two temporal
segments are slightly different.
Considering the above statistical features of the cold
materials in the ICMEs, the relevant questions would be what
is the nature of the cold material and how is it formed? Note
that cold materials are not unique to ICMEs. A study by Zhao
et al. (2017) reported that the decrease in the ratio of C

appears in approximately 10% of slow solar wind. In addition,
the slow solar wind in that work was deﬁned as having a speed
of less than 500km s−1. They explained that the

decreases as a result of either high-altitude reconnection

phenomenon was also reported by Kocher et al. (2017) in the
study of ICMEs. Checking our COC materials, we found all of
them having lower C

materials is typically less than 500km s−1.
For the COC materials related to the ﬁlaments, the mean
charge difference between the carbon ions and other heavier
ions may be related to the initiation process of the CMEs. It is
known that the freeze-in heights of the C, O, Mg, Si, and Fe
ions are different. For example, in the slow wind, the carbon
ion charge state is the ﬁrst to freeze-in at approximately
1.2solar radii (Rs) (Geiss et al. 1995). Therefore, one possible
process for forming COC type ﬁlament materials may be
heating and collision beyond the carbon freeze-in height.
During the eruption of CME, if the reconnection occurs above
the carbon freeze-in height, but lower than those for other ions,
then one expects that the carbon is cold, but other ions can go
through ionizations and become hotter. Another possible
explanation for the COC ﬁlament materials’ formation is the
prominence condensation in hot coronal loops. This has long
been studied by Antiochos & Klimchuk (1991), Antiochos
et al. (2000), and Karpen et al. (2005); it has been found that
the ﬁlament material laying on the hot coronal loop is a
combination of the cool condensed coronal plasmas and the
evaporated chromospheric plasmas resulting from the pressure
imbalance. Thus, the COC type ﬁlament materials may be a
bulk of mixed ions from both the corona and the chromosphere.
It is not easy to understand the process leading to the
formation of IC type ﬁlament materials. On one hand, the lower
mean charges of all the C, O, Mg, Si, and Fe ions compared to
that of the solar wind means that plasmas may not be
sufﬁciently heated under 5Rs (Geiss et al. 1995). On the other
hand, the higher proton temperature means that the protons of
the IC type ﬁlament materials tend to be heated. Such a heating
may be possible by waves. It seems that in the events
containing IC type ﬁlament materials the CMEs erupt without
strong reconnection heating but are accompanied by prefer-
ential proton-wave resonance which efﬁciently heats protons.
The fact that the IC type ﬁlament materials are found in non-
MC ICMEs after the year 2006 and that the COC type ﬁlament
materials are found in MCs before the year 2006, may suggest
that these two types of ﬁlaments reﬂect fundamental differences
between
the
two
different
solar
cycles
(Gopalswamy
et al. 2015). Indeed, the solar activity was quite weak during
the early years of the 24th solar cycle.
According to our study there are some IC and COC segments
not related to the ﬁlaments. One possibility is that the core of
CMEs were not observed due to the SOHO position and its
instrument limitation. Another possibility is that these IC/COC
segments do not correspond to ﬁlaments. As far as we know,
there have been NRs of IC materials identiﬁed in the
solar wind.
Our study suggests that there may be two different ﬁlament
eruption processes, which have opposite effects on the
ionization and proton temperatures. Although the occurrence
rate of CC material in ICMEs is close to that of three-part
CMEs, we cannot conﬁrm that all CC segments are ﬁlament
materials due to the limitation of solar observations before the
STEREO era. Similar cold plasmas also appear in slow solar
wind although with a lower occurrence rate (Zhao et al. 2017).
Finally, we noted that further careful studies of IC materials
may help us better understand both the CME initiation process
and the heating mechanisms associated with the initiation. Such
a study will beneﬁt from the high-resolution imager on board
the Solar Dynamics Observatory spacecraft (Pesnell et al.
2012) and future missions such as the Solar Orbiter (Mueller
et al. 2013).
