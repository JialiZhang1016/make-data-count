ABSTRACT
Invasive species are ranked as one of the leading drivers of global biodiversity loss. To mitigate 
their impact, we must understand the future risks caused by invasive species, particularly to flora of 
conservation concern. Here we used species distribution modelling (SDM) to project the current 
and future (RCP45 and RCP85 2050) distributions of four deer species and 13 plant species of 
conservation concern for the island of Ireland, quantifying changes in distributions and overlap. 
Large areas of suitable habitat for the deer species were predicted with high accuracy across all 
counties, with future climate scenarios identifying an expansion in sika deer distributions and 
a decrease in muntjac and fallow deer distributions. Red deer declined under the moderate climate 
change scenario but increased under the worst-case projection. Future projections predicted the 
(local) extinction of six (out of 13) endangered and vulnerable plant species. An expansion in 
distributions was observed for four plant species; however, these areas had large overlap with the 
future predictions of deer, placing further pressures on these plant species. These findings suggest 
that targeted conservation and management measures are required to alleviate the pressures on 
‘at-risk’ plant species due to grazing from native and non-native deer.

Introduction
Climate change and concomitant human activities are 
placing ecosystems under unparalleled pressures (Chen 
et al. 2011; Linders et al. 2019; Pejchar and Mooney  
2009). The recent Intergovernmental Science Policy 
Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) 
report (Díaz et al. 2019) identified that over 1 million 
species are threatened with accelerated extinction. This 
deterioration is directly linked to human activity, with 
the spread of invasive species ranked as one of the 
primary drivers of this loss. Invasions by non-native spe­
cies directly and indirectly affect biodiversity and, as 
a result, ecosystem functions (Linders et al. 2019). In 
order to mitigate the potentially devastating scenarios 
for biodiversity and ecosystems, it is imperative to better 
understand the future extinction risk caused by invasive 
species (Bellard, Bernery, and Leclerc 2021).
Deer species, including sika (Cervus nippon), muntjac 
(Muntiacus reevesi) and fallow (Dama dama), are prepon­
derant examples of invasive species in Europe 
(Saggiomo, Esattore, and Picone 2020). Following their 
introduction throughout Europe, sika deer have under­
gone rapid population increase (Carden et al. 2010; 
Homolka and Heroldová 2003), becoming naturalized 
in some countries with extensive and invasive 
populations found in Germany, the Czech Republic, 
United Kingdom and Ireland (Carden et al. 2010; 
Homolka 
and 
Heroldová 
2003; 
Pérez-Espona, 
Pemberton, and Putman 2009). Muntjac deer are also 
expanding rapidly across Europe, with predictions that 
this species will expand its range to encompass every 
European country (Ward, Richardson, and Mergeay  
2021). Large-scale browsing and grazing by non-native 
deer species has cascading effects on biodiversity due to 
direct interactions with other species, including plants, 
invertebrates, smaller species and other herbivores 
(Akashi and Nakashizuka 1999; Homolka and Heroldová  
2003; Rooney and Waller 2003). For example, Pollard and 
Cooke (1994) identified that muntjac deer preferentially 
grazed on lower leaves of honeysuckle (Lonicera pericly­
menum) which are the preferred egg laying sites of the 
white admiral butterfly (Ladoga Camilla), leading to their 
population decline. This subsequently raises numerous 
management and control issues (Carden et al. 2010).
Overabundance of deer, and the additional effects 
that are associated therewith, such as effects on biodi­
versity or ecology, is extensively discussed in their native 
ranges (Iida, Soga, and Koike 2016; Kato and Okuyama  
2004; Ohashi et al. 2014; Uno et al. 2019). For example, 
Iida, Soga, and Koike (2016) studied the effects of sika

deer overpopulation on flora and invertebrates in 
Western Hokkaido in Northern Japan. Two sites were 
investigated, the shore of Lake Troya (a control site) 
and Nakanoshima Island (experimental site). During the 
1950’s and 60’s, three sika deer were introduced on the 
island for tourism (Kaji, Koizumi, and Ohtaishi 1988). 
Over this period there was a significant increase in sika 
deer density on the island (Ikeda et al. 2013), which 
resulted in a dramatic decrease in both understory vege­
tation and beetle diversity. This study quantifies how 
populations of sika deer can alter native species richness, 
abundance and likely the ecological functions of an area.
Saggiomo, Esattore, and Picone (2020) conducted 
a recent bibliometric analysis which presented all pub­
lished scientific work on sika deer that has been accom­
plished to date. It was found that most studies came 
from Asia, Europe, Africa and North America. The litera­
ture on native populations focused mainly on the effects 
of sika overpopulation and its effects on vegetation such 
as the dwarf bamboo, whereas the literature on sika deer 
in their introduced range mainly explored hybridization 
(Bailey 2013; Gélin et al. 2019; Huxel 1999). This is in 
contrast to the impact of muntjac and fallow deer on 
native and non-native vegetation that has been widely 
researched (Pollard and Cooke 1994; Cooke and Farrell  
2001, Morecroft et al. 2003; Husheer and Frampton 2005; 
Marozas et al. 2009; Fuller and Gill 2010; Cooke 2021; 
Cunningham et al. 2022). The consensus so far is that 
deer species, particularly non-native species, negatively 
impact vegetation diversity in regions, with cascading 
effects on insect and bird species. However, studies have 
not been conclusive, with differences across species and 
geographic regions. Studying one species in isolation 
can lead to species-specific results that are not general­
izable to the wider and connected ecosystem (Meyer 
et al. 2019), particularly for organizations and practi­
tioners managing these ecosystems. Subsequently, 
extensive studies exploring the impact of multiple deer 
species distributions and populations on the flora of 
non-native ecosystems are lacking (Saggiomo, Esattore, 
and Picone 2020).
In Ireland, between 1978 and 2008 there was a range 
expansion of 565%, 353% and 174%, for red, sika and 
fallow deer, respectively (Carden et al. 2010). The 
increase in both human and deer populations has heigh­
tened the potential for human-deer conflict in recent 
years, with research predominantly focusing on their 
impact to the agriculture and forestry sectors 
(Hawthorne, Colombaroli, and Mitchell 2021; Liu and 
Nieuwenhuis 2014; Wilson, Wirz, and Byrne 2021), deer- 
vehicle collisions (Liu, Nieuwenhuis, and McCullagh  
2018), their role as disease vectors and/or hosts 
(Crispell et al. 2020; Kelly, Mullen, and Good 2021; 
McDonough and Holloway 2020), hybridization with 
the native red deer (Carden et al. 2010; Gélin et al.  
2019; Huxel 1999; McDevitt et al. 2009; Smith et al.  
2014), and their impact on the native vegetation 
(Perrin, Mitchell, and Kelly 2011), although the latter is 
the most depauperate research area at a national scale.
The diet of deer species is varied, with that of the non- 
native sika and native red deer overlapping in south- 
west Ireland, causing competition (Burkitt 2009). 
Although the bark from saplings and grasses are the 
preferred diet of sika, they have been known to browse 
and graze unconditionally on forbs, berries, heather and 
other vegetation (Mann and Putman 1989; Yokoyama, 
Kaji, and Suzuki 2000). Muntjac deer have also been 
found to graze plant species that are avoided by other 
deer species, such as bluebells (Hyacinthoides non- 
scripta), which can shift the equilibrium of native ecosys­
tems (Dolman et al. 2010). In Ireland, the Red Data List of 
Irish Vascular Plants (National Botanical Gardens 2017) 
identifies that there are currently seven critically endan­
gered plant species, 52 endangered species and 69 vul­
nerable species. Subsequently, any expansion of non- 
native (or even native) deer distributions in the future 
may place further pressures on these plant species that 
are already at risk due to climate change and habitat 
degradation. Despite the potential impact of invasive 
species, many of their effects can be mediated through 
vegetation abundance, species richness and diversity 
(Linders et al. 2019). To that end, non-native deer must 
be focused on as they are a key species for conservation 
and management efforts, particularly in supporting the 
Irish Biodiversity Action Plan (2019). To achieve sustain­
ability in ecosystems and biodiversity, the prevention of 
any further spread, or establishment of an invasive spe­
cies has been recognized as a more efficient and a less 
costly method of control than large-scale culling or bar­
rier control (Barbet-Massin et al. 2018). Moreover, if it is 
known where future spreads may occur, then adaptation 
efforts can be implemented to ensure minimal impact 
on any native and/or flora of conservation concern. 
Therefore, the initial step for effective management is 
quantification of how deer and flora distributions will 
change in the future (Carden et al. 2010).
Species distribution models (SDMs) are one of the 
most important GIScience application areas (Burch 
et al. 2020; Laffan, Skidmore, and Franklin 2014; Miller 
et al. 2020), and a powerful spatial analytical tool for 
studying the geographic distribution of a range of taxa 
(Franklin 2010; Peterson et al. 2011), providing 
a methodological framework for researchers and practi­
tioners to quantitatively assess the relationship between 
species distributions and environmental factors. SDMs

geographic space using a variety of statistical methods 
and machine learning algorithms (Miller and Holloway  
2017) and have been widely used for various applica­
tions, including projecting suitable aquaculture sites 
(O’Mahony, de la Torre Cerro, and Holloway 2021), fore­
casting global change impacts on biodiversity (Ehrlén, 
Morris, and Buckley 2015), locating nature reserves 
(Araújo et al. 2004), and predicting future ranges of 
invasive species (Barbet-Massin et al. 2018; McMahon 
et al. 2021). For example, McMahon et al. (2021) mod­
elled the distribution of 15 non-native invasive grass and 
forb species of conservation concern in western North 
America. The aim of the study was to characterize the 
species environmental niches and identify potential 
invasion risks. The results showed that the species are 
likely to expand their ranges and coupled with contin­
ued increases in aridity, temperature and burned areas 
the risk of future invasions is high. Through the use of 
GIScience and SDMs, this study was able to aid in identi­
fying possible new invasion sites and prioritize the pre­
vention and control of the invasive species.
Despite the fact that non-native deer species are of 
ecological and economic concern in Ireland, coupled 
with the ability of SDMs to project current and future 
distributions, there is a paucity of research that focuses 
on predictions of deer distributions in Ireland, particu­
larly related to native vegetation. Such information is 
vital in determining which locations require regulation, 
management, or conservation. Here we explore four 
main research questions with the overall aim of identify­
ing the factors that drive deer distributions and to reveal 
areas at greatest risk to biodiversity loss for the island of 
Ireland: 1) What is the current suitable distribution of the 
four deer species currently established in Ireland? 2) 
What are the current suitable distributions of endan­
gered/vulnerable plant species? 3) How will the 
distributions of the deer species and plant species differ 
under future climate change scenarios? 4) Where will the 
deer species and plant species future distributions 
overlap?
Methods
Data collection
Presence data for the four deer species and 13 endan­
gered/vulnerable plant species were obtained from the 
Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIFa-q) using 
the rgbif package (Chamberlain et al. 2021) in R version 
4.1.2 (R Core Team 2021). Following data cleaning as of 
December 2021, 309 records for C. nippon, 299 records 
for C. elaphus, 835 records for D. dama and 281 for 
M. reevesi were returned, while plant species were 
retained if they had at least 10 occurrence records. All 
data observations were returned for the period after 
2000 only, meaning any observations prior to then 
were disregarded. Plant species were identified from 
The Red Data List of Irish Vascular Plants (National 
Botanical Gardens 2017) and are outlined in Table 1. In 
total, 13 plant species were used including 5 endan­
gered and 8 vulnerable plant species. Most plant species 
in The Red Data List of Irish Vascular Plants had little or 
no occurrence records, meaning they were omitted from 
the analysis.
All observations that were utilized within this study 
came from human observations, predominantly from 
citizen science programmes such as the National 
Biodiversity Data Centre and iNaturalist. For all but four 
of the species, coordinate uncertainty was reported for 
over 90% of the observations for each species, with the 
majority of the species reporting uncertainty at less than 
1000 m, which is the approximate spatial resolution of

the SDM. P. alpina, R. islandica and V. lathyroides had 
over 50% of their observations with a high uncertainty; 
however, these represented some of the smaller sample 
sizes. Recent research has identified that data quantity is 
more important than spatial and/or other bias in the 
predictive performance of SDMs (Gaul et al. 2020). Due 
to the low number of observations reported for these 
species, we opted for data quantity over spatial bias and 
uncertainty introduced by using these locations where 
uncertainty in spatial positioning was higher than the 
resolution of the SDM. Please see the Supplementary 
Material for a breakdown of this information of the 
GBIF observations.
Environmental data included climate and land cover 
data. Climate data were obtained from the WorldClim 
database (Fick and Hijmans 2017) using the sdmpredic­
tors package (Bosch et al. 2017) in R version 4.1.2 (R Core 
team 2021). Corine land cover (EEA, 2018) data was used 
to calculate the percentage of arable, forest, grass, pas­
ture, urban and water cover. All variables had a spatial 
resolution of 30 arc seconds, approximately 1 km. To 
represent 
the 
future 
climatic 
predictors, 
the 
Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM 
4.0) 
was 
selected 
under 
the 
Representative 
Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5. RCP was cho­
sen over the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP) due 
to the unavailability of SSP at the required scale in the 
WorldClim database, which would hinder reproducible 
research. This model is a coupled climate model for 
simulating the earth’s climate maintained by the 
Climate and Global Dynamics laboratory at the 
National Centre for Atmospheric Research, USA (Gent 
et al. 2011).
In this study, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 were selected to 
model the future distributions of four deer species and 
the 13 endangered/vulnerable plant species in the years 
2050 (average predicted conditions of 2041–2060). RCP 
4.5 is an ‘intermediate’ scenario with an emissions peak 
around 2040 and a steady decline thereafter. RCP 8.5 is 
the basis for the ‘worst-case’ scenario were emissions to 
continue to increase until 2100 (Meinshausen et al.  
2011). We opted to assume that land cover will remain 
consistent in the future, which is most likely 
a simplification of reality. While there have been recent 
global products of future land use, such as ESRI’s Living 
Atlas Land Use 2050 data, this currently is not projecting 
in our opinion realistic covers. For example, the product 
predicts the vast removal of cropland across Ireland, 
being replaced with grassland, the conversion of 
Killarney forests into swampland and the conversion of 
large parts of Dublin into cropland. A recent study by 
Kang et al. (2022) found that ESRI’s current land cover 
data had the lowest overall accuracy when land cover 
was assessed. Therefore, in the absence of a realistic 
future projection, we feel that the assumption that 
land cover remains unchanged is justified and is stan­
dard practice when future land cover projections are 
missing in SDM research (e.g. Stanton et al. 2012).
Data analysis
SDMs generate a prediction of habitat suitability in both 
environmental and geographic space. The most com­
mon response variables used are data representing spe­
cies 
presence-absence 
or 
presence-only 
(with 
corresponding pseudo-absences), which are coupled 
with a set of corresponding and georeferenced environ­
mental variables (Franklin 2010). Species-environment 
relationships are then estimated using a range of statis­
tical approaches that can then be extrapolated in space 
and time, generating a habitat suitability map that iden­
tifies the probability that the environmental conditions 
at that location are favourable for the study species. 
A categorical representation of habitat suitability is cre­
ated by using a threshold that delineates between sui­
table-unsuitable, with habitat suitability values above 
and below this predicted as suitable and unsuitable, 
respectively. Figure 1 provides a methodological work­
flow of the SDM steps used in this study. 
GBIF provides information on presence-only, mean­
ing we did not have a true consideration of absence. As 
such, 10000 pseudo-absences (or background points) 
were randomly drawn from the study area, following 
the established standards set out by Barbet-Massin 
et al. (2012) to ensure a binomial function could be 
applied to the statistical models. According to Barbet- 
Massin et al (2012, 2018), the results of SDM projections 
can be impacted by the location of pseudo-absences. 
Therefore, we decided to replicate data analysis three 
times with different pseudo-absence selections to 
account for such model uncertainty.
Three different statistical models were implemented 
within the biomod2 package (Thuiller et al. 2016) in 
R version 4.1.2 (R Core team 2021). The methods we 
selected for initial analysis included Generalized Linear 
Model (GLM), Maximum Entropy (Maxent) and Random 
Forest (RF). Studies have shown that different model­
ling techniques can produce different results for the 
same species and datasets, with ensembles across dif­
ferent statistical models suggested (Araujo and Guisan  
2006; Elith and Graham 2009; Thuiller 2004). However, 
the results for GLM and Maxent were poor in compar­
ison to RF (results not shown), and when coupled with 
recent research that has identified there is no particu­
lar benefit to using an ensemble approach across dif­
ferent statistical models over individually tuned 
556

statistical models (Hao et al. 2020), we opted to pro­
gress this research using only RF. RF constructs many 
decision trees using bootstrap samples (Liaw and 
Wiener, 2002) averaging these results into one projec­
tion. By default, RF can be modelled in the form of 
classification and/or regression trees (Zhang et al.  
2019) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) (Lek and 
Guégan 2000; Ripley 1996).
Models were evaluated after parameterization to 
justify the acceptance of projections for their 
intended purpose (Araujo and Guisan 2006). We per­
formed 3-fold cross-validation of the data by splitting 
the occurrence records and pseudo-absences using 
an 80:20 split into training and testing data following 
best practice in the SDM literature when independent 
test data are not available (Hijmans 2012; O’Mahony, 
de la Torre Cerro, and Holloway 2021; Peterson et al.  
2011). The model’s discriminatory power between 
suitable and unsuitable was assessed using three 
different metrics which can be used to provide an 
accurate assessment of the models. The area under 
the curve (AUC) statistic of a receiver operating char­
acteristic (ROC) (Hanley and McNeil 1982) is 
a threshold-independent metric and widely used in 
SDM research (Franklin 2010). It has a value range 
between 0 and 1 with a value below 0.5 deemed no 
better than a random selection and a value of 1 
representing a highly accurate model. True Skill 
Statistic (TSS) measures the performance of models 
generating presence-absence predictions with values 
of 0 indicating no agreement and 1 indicating perfect 
agreement (McHugh 2012). Cohen’s kappa corrects 
the overall accuracy of model predictions by the 
accuracy expected to occur by chance (Allouche, 
Tsoar, and Kadmon 2006). It ranges from values −1 
to + 1, where + 1 indicates perfect agreement and 
values of 0 or less indicate a performance no better 
than random (Cohen 1960).
For each pseudo-absence configuration, we there­
fore ran three different RF models to obtain 
a consensus distribution, calculating an ensemble 
forecast distribution. This meant that for each spe­
cies, we had nine possible distribution projections. 
The projections from these individual models were 
ensembled using the median habitat suitability 
value. The accuracy values were also reported based 
on the mean of the nine individual models. The 
ensemble model uses a continuous probability distri­
bution which was then discretized into a binary sui­
table-unsuitable map using the probability threshold 
that maximized the TSS value (Liu et al. 2005).
The same SDM procedure was undertaken for the 13 
plant species. To determine plant species richness under 
current conditions and future scenarios RCP45 and 
RCP85 2050, the binary maps produced for each plant 
species were stacked. For example, if all 13 species were 
projected in the same 1 km grid cell, then the value 
would be 13.
The Biomod.RangeSize function within the biomod2 
package was used to calculate the current and future 
distribution in square kilometres (km2) for each spe­
cies. It was also used to calculate the overlap of the

Results
We projected the four deer species distributions with 
high accuracy values across the island of Ireland for all 
accuracy metrics (Figure2, Table 2). The current habitat 
suitability of C. nippon is approximately 1257 km2 (Figure 
2(D), Table. 3) with suitable areas identified in all coun­
ties with the exception of Galway and Mayo. There are 
four large geographic areas of continuous suitable cli­
mate and habitat, these are the Wicklow mountains, the 
upland areas of County Kerry, the upland areas of West 
Cork, the upland area between Carlow and Wexford and 
some suitable areas in the Burren region of Clare. The 
current habitat suitability of M. reevesi is approximately 
231 km2 (Figure 2g, Table. 3) with a suitable area mainly 
confined to the eastern Peninsula of Strangford Lough, 
Co. Down. The current habitat suitability of C. elaphus is 
approximately 571 km2 (Figure 2j, Table. 3) with suitable 
areas identified in all counties, although there are two 
large areas of continuous suitable climate and habitat, 
these are Killarney, Co. Kerry and Co. Donegal. The cur­
rent habitat suitability of D. dama is approximately 382  
km2 with suitable areas in all counties (Figure 2m, Table. 
3). However, there are six large geographic areas of 
continuous suitable climate and habitat, these are 
Phoenix Park, Co. Dublin, the Mourne mountains, Co. 
Down, the Tyrone-Monaghan border region, Co. Sligo, 
the uplands of the Laois/Offaly border and Co. Waterford 
with bordering areas of southern Tipperary and 
Kilkenny.
We also projected the distributions of the 13 flora

distribution outputs were stacked to represent species 
richness of species of conservation concern (Figure 2a- 
c), the areas of high flora species richness did not 
overlap with the current distribution of three deer 
species, with D. dama being the only exception as it 
is the only deer species to have a current area of 
continuous suitable climate and habitat in Co. Dublin 
where current flora species richness (of conservation 
concern) is highest. For flora of conservation concern 
in general, high levels of species richness mainly occur 
in and/or around regions with a mixture of urban and 
agricultural environments such as Dublin, Waterford, 
Cork and Dundalk (Figure 2a). Other areas that have 
lower levels of flora species richness occurring outside 
these regions included the more rural regions of West 
Galway/Connemara, the Burren, the Shannon Estuary, 
Killarney, small areas of West Cork, the Three Sister 
Estuary (Waterford Harbour) and the East coast of Co. 
Wexford.
The area of high ‘at-risk’ floral species richness in the 
climate scenario RCP45 2050 is projected to increase 
(Figure 2b), with large areas of the east reporting 
a projected higher richness. These are areas where the 
models project a suitable climate and habitat for multi­
ple endangered/vulnerable plant species, which occur in 
the south, south-east and mid-west of Ireland 
(Figure 2e). The climate scenario RCP85 2050 predicts 
a substantial increase in plant species richness across the 
island compared to current plant species richness 
(Figure 2c). Areas with the highest levels of species rich­
ness include large parts of the east and south of the 
island. Also, areas of high flora species richness are not 
just confined to the urban areas.
The area projected as suitable for C. nippon substan­
tially increases from the current 1,257 km2 when 
projecting into future climate scenarios, with suitable 
areas of 6,392 km2 and 14,446 km2 for RCP45 and 
RCP85, respectively (Table 3). The climate scenario 
RCP45 2050 reveals that the habitat of C. nippon will 
increase, expanding its current primary locations, such 
as the Wicklow mountains, the upland areas of County 
Kerry, the upland areas of west Cork, the upland areas of 
Carlow/Wexford border and the Co. Clare region. Also 
indicating more large areas of continuous suitable cli­
mate and habitat in the mid-west, midlands, southern, 
eastern and north-eastern parts of the island (Figure 2e). 
The climate scenario RCP85 2050 reveals that the habitat 
of C. nippon will substantially increase, expanding its 
current primary locations and with an increase in areas 
of suitable climate and habitat in all regions of the island 
with the exception of the northwest (Figure 2f).
For M. reevesi, there are no suitable areas projected 
for both future climate scenarios (Figure 2h-i). The area 
projected as suitable for C. elaphus decreases from the 
current 571km2 to 392km2 for the future climate sce­
nario RCP45, but has a large increase for the future 
climate scenario RCP85 with an area of 2835km2 
(Table 3). The climate scenario RCP85 2050 reveals that 
the habitat of C. elaphus will be substantially increased, 
with a large increase in Kerry/West Cork region and 
a slight decrease in current primary locations 
(Figure 2k, i). The area projected as suitable for 
D. dama decreases from the current 1,459km2 when 
projecting into future climate scenarios, with suitable 
areas of 1,088km2 and 543km2 for RCP45 and RCP85, 
respectively (Table 3). The climate scenario RCP45 2050 
reveals that the habitat of D. dama will decrease, losing 
some of its current primary locations, such as Co. 
Waterford with bordering areas of southern Tipperary 
and Kilkenny, and Phoenix Park, Co. Dublin. However,

other primary locations have a smaller decrease in size 
(Figure 2n). The climate scenario RCP85 2050 reveals that 
the habitat of D. dama will be substantially decreased, 
losing some of its current primary locations and a new 
suitable area in the Kerry/West Cork region. With the 
other suitable areas being in small areas of the midlands 
and North-East of the island (Figure 2o).
Out of the 13 plant species, four plant species have 
a range increase from their current range for both future 
climate scenarios. These species are A. schoenoprasum, 
D. cantabrica, H. secalinum and L. subbiflorus, with all 
species having a large increase compared to their pre­
dicted current range size (Table 3). There are six plant 
species, C. trachelium, E. mackaiana, G. sylvaticum, 
P. alpina, T. subterraneum and V. lathyroides which have 
no suitable geographic locations for both future climate 
scenarios with a projection of extinction reported by our 
models. Three plant species have a decrease in both 
future climate scenarios. These species are C. cyanus, 
F. alnus and R. islandica (Table 3).
When the distributions of C. nippon and the 13 
plant species are considered together, all six of the 
flora species with a predicted future area of suitability 
are predicted to have some overlap with the future 
range of C. nippon (see Table 4, 5); however, the areas 
of overlap vary in size. For example, F. alnus is the only 
flora species whose future range size is predicted to 
have a 100% overlap with C. nippon for both future 
climate scenarios. For the future scenario RCP45 2050, 
R. islandica had a predicted overlap of 18.18%, 
D. cantabrica 11.59%, A. schoenoprasum 9.99%, 
H. secalinum 9.20% and L. subbiflorus 7.55% (Table 4). 
For future scenario RCP85 2050, D. cantabrica had an 
predicted overlap of 32.99%, H. secalinum 25.04%, 
A. schoenoprasum 21.39%, L. subbiflorus 17.07% and 
R.islandica 16.67% (Table 5).
When the distributions of C. elaphus and the 13 plant 
species are considered together, five of the flora species 
with a predicted future area of suitability are predicted 
to have some overlap with the future range of C. elaphus 
(see Table 4, 5); however, the areas of overlap are not 
extensive. F. alnus is the only flora species whose future 
range size is predicted to have an extensive overlap with 
C. elaphus for both future climate scenarios with a 100% 
predicted overlap in scenario RCP45 2050 and 
a predicted overlap of 92.86% in scenario RCP85 2050 
(Table 4). The future RCP45 2050 distribution for 
H. secalinum has no predicted overlap with C. elaphus 
and the lowest predicted overlap of 0.29% for the future 
RCP85 2050 distribution. All the other flora species are 
predicted to have an overlap of less than 3.5% with 
C. elaphus for both future scenarios, largely due to the 
restricted south-west distribution of C. elaphus under 
future climate scenarios.

J. O’MAHONY ET AL.
When the distributions of D. dama and the 13 plant 
species are considered together, four of the flora species 
with a predicted future area of suitability are predicted 
to have some overlap with the future range of D. dama 
(see Table 4, 5); however, the areas of overlap are not 
extensive, with all the flora species predicted to have an 
overlap of less 3% for both future climate scenarios 
(Tables 4, 5). However, there are two species, C. cyanus 
and R. islandica who are both predicted to have no 
future overlap with D. dama for both future climate 
scenarios. Although, the future RCP45 2050 distribution 
for F. alnus has the highest predicted overlap of 100% 
with D. dama; the RCP85 2050 distribution also has the 
highest predicted overlap for all flora species with 
a predicted overlap of 92.86%.
Discussion
The main aim of this research was to identify the geo­
graphic distribution of the four deer species currently 
found on the island of Ireland (three of which are non- 
native) and to reveal areas that may be at risk of biodi­
versity loss, focusing on endangered and vulnerable 
plant species. In doing so, we aimed to support recent 
calls in the literature to support the decision-making 
spectrum of related management and conservation 
dilemmas on the flora in the non-native ranges of deer 
species (Carden et al. 2010; Saggiomo, Esattore, and 
Picone 2020). This research is to our knowledge the 
first attempt to use a species distribution modelling 
framework to estimate the current and future distribu­
tions of deer and plant species of conservation concern 
at an all-Ireland level. We projected species distributions 
to high accuracy levels (Table 1), with large areas of 
currently suitable habitat for deer species across coun­
ties. Future climate scenarios identified an increase in 
sika deer, while muntjac and fallow deer are projected to 
reduce their distributions under climate change. Red 
deer appeared to decline under the moderate climate 
change scenario but increase under the worst-case pro­
jection. However, climate change projections appeared 
to project the local extinction of six (out of 13) endan­
gered and vulnerable plant species (Table 3). Moreover, 
while an increase in area was identified for four plant 
species, several of these areas overlap with the future 
projections of deer species (Tables 4, 5), which could 
cause further pressures on these ‘at-risk’ plant species.
Our results are incongruent with the current thinking 
that all deer species will continue to expand their habitat 
in Ireland (Carden et al. 2010). While we projected an 
expansion of sika under both RCP scenarios, which is 
congruent with predictions (Carden et al. 2010), we 
identified a decrease in range size for fallow and muntjac 
deer, and a decrease under RCP45 for red deer, albeit 
with an increase under RCP85. This does not imply that 
all deer species will not be present in currently occupied 
areas at the time of this prediction, it simply forecasts the 
most suitable habitat for the modelled species in rela­
tion to the environmental variables of that period. 
A central assumption of SDM assumes that a species is 
at equilibrium with its environment, which is where it 
occurs in all suitable sites, while being absent from all 
unsuitable sites (Araújo, Pearson, and Rahbek 2005). 
However, introduced species often violate this assump­
tion as occurrence records of the species do not always 
inform its potential distribution (Gallien et al. 2012). This 
could have been improved by using global distribution 
records from the native ranges (O’Mahony, de la Torre 
Cerro, and Holloway 2021); however, given the length of 
time the deer species have been present on the island of 
Ireland (e.g. sika were introduced in the 1860s – Purser 
et al. 2009), these species are most likely in equilibrium 
with the environment. As such they are no longer 
expanding their ranges, which may account for the 
reduction in range size projected by our models. 
Muntjac are the species that has been present on the 
island for the shortest period, meaning the low habitat 
suitability projected for this species may be an artefact of 
the assumed equilibrium, and as such should be treated 
with caution.
Moreover, we opted to threshold our habitat suitabil­
ity projections from a continuous probability to a binary 
output. This was to provide the framework to test the 
areas of overlap with ‘at-risk’ plant species. While there is 
a low probability of occurrence in these regions based 
on climate and land cover, it is feasible for the species to 
be found there. This is particularly relevant for invasive 
species, which are often released and dispersed through 
less-than-ideal environmental conditions (Barbet-Massin 
et al. 2018).
Despite this, expansion of invasive deer species in 
other countries has slowed, with muntjac range expan­
sion dropping to 2–3% in England from 2011 to 2016 
compared to an expansion of almost 12% in 2007 (Ward, 
Richardson, and Mergeay 2021). When this concept is 
coupled with the lower-than-average forest cover in 
Ireland compared to other European countries (<1% at 
the turn of the century – Mitchell 2000), it is likely that 
deer species in Ireland are inhabiting areas of lower 
suitability, or at the very least climatically different 
areas than it may favour given complete forest coverage. 
We opted to keep land cover consistent in the models, in 
part due to a lack of reliable alternatives, which is in line 
with the SDM literature (Stanton et al. 2012). However, 
with active afforestation policies in Ireland (i.e. Forest 
Action Plan 2022) that are aiming to increase the area

of forests as well as the native components of these 
woodlands, it is likely that our models are an under­
estimation of future geographic distributions of all deer 
species. Despite this, our models provide a baseline of 
the minimum potential impact to ‘at-risk’ plant species, 
and as such will support and inform future management 
strategies.
We projected a local extinction of six ‘at-risk’ plant 
species under future climate scenarios. The local extinc­
tion of any species could have cascading effects on the 
ecosystem, but our models have projected that almost 
50% of the plant species considered here may go extinct 
(Figure 2). Given that the 13 species included in this 
analysis were the only ones to reach a minimum number 
of observations in GBIF, the reality is that there may be 
a much higher rate of extinction for flora species of 
conservation concern, as these are in theory the most 
common of the endangered and vulnerable plant spe­
cies. As such, there is a pressing concern for research to 
be directed towards understanding how these species 
will respond to climate change. It should be noted here 
that the drivers of vascular plant extinctions are 
nuanced, with numerous pressures globally and within 
Ireland (Nic Lughadha et al. 2020; O’Rourke, Lughadha, 
and Bacon 2022). Therefore, the potential for extinction 
based on these climate models must be considered 
alongside many other complex and interlinked ecosys­
tem functions and pressures, such as habitat loss, exploi­
tation, intensification of agriculture and non-native 
herbivory.
Contrary to the extinction risk, we did identify that 
some ‘at-risk’ species are projected to increase their 
geographically suitable area. ‘At-risk’ plant species 
richness appeared to increase nationally, with some 
of the highest projected richness occurring in urban 
and agricultural areas (Figure 2e, f). We posit here the 
importance of the landscape matrix (i.e. multiple habi­
tats) and urban wildflower meadows that have 
become increasingly popular in city centres in recent 
years to allow citizens to observe and enjoy the plea­
sures of nature (Bretzel et al. 2016) and more recently 
support the biodiversity crisis (Mody et al. 2020). These 
green spaces help to mitigate the negative impacts of 
urbanization on biodiversity such as habitat loss, frag­
mentation, decreased population size and loss of 
genetic diversity across a multitude of species 
(Lambert, Cawkwell, and Holloway 2021; Vega and 
Küffer 2021). Moreover, Ireland has been reported as 
a location whereby species have expanded their geo­
graphic ranges in recent years in response to climate 
change (Bellard et al. 2018; Donnelly et al. 2014), and 
while such research warrants further investigation, our 
findings suggest that certain plant species that are 
currently restricted locally on the island may benefit 
from changes to the existing climate.
For example, the Biodiversity Audit of the Áras an 
Uachtaraín in Dublin in 2019–2020 identified 297 species 
of plant in the 130-acre site (Gaughran and Stout 2020). 
While significantly larger than the average urban green­
space in Ireland, the importance of these refuges to 
native species is clear, with the dispersal of plants from 
the plantation sites to support urban range expansion 
well documented (Gilbert and Anderson 1998). 
Moreover, given the avoidance of urban centres by 
deer species in Ireland, urban areas could provide 
a refuge for many plant species, including endangered 
and vulnerable species to not only persist, but thrive 
under future climates. Almost 50% of the plant species 
included in this analysis are available to purchase from 
horticulturalists, suggesting this urban refuge may sup­
port these species.
Conversely, it is also important to consider the areas 
predicted to have a low richness of ‘at-risk’ species. 
Linders et al. (2019) state that one of the most effective 
mediation strategies for invasive species is to support 
vegetation abundance, species richness and diversity, so 
that any grazing pressure is ‘shared’ among species. It 
can be seen from Figure 2b-c that areas of lower species 
richness under the two RCP scenarios are found in the 
south-west, including Co. Kerry and Cork, the north-west 
and large areas of Northern Ireland. When these outputs 
are compared with the future outputs of C. nippon and 
C. elaphus distributions (Figures 2e-f and k-l), the area in 
the south-west of Ireland can be identified as an area 
that may need to be explicitly monitored due to the 
presence of one or two ‘at-risk’ plant species and 
a large geographic distribution of deer. Therefore, any 
management strategy should look to ensure that there is 
a diverse range of vegetation available, such that certain 
species are not subject to increased and unsustainable 
grazing. This is particularly pertinent given the multi­
faceted and nuanced implications of forest manage­
ment, with Hawthorne, Colombaroli, and Mitchell 
(2021) suggesting that the complete exclusion of graz­
ing by deer in the region would be undesirable due to 
the potential encroachment of woody species leading to 
the decline of woodland specialists.
There was one plant species predicted to have a 100% 
overlap with three deer species under climate change. F. 
alnus is predicted to occur in the west of Ireland in and 
around current suitable areas in the Burren, Killarney and 
West Cork Region. This plant is mainly found in damp, 
peaty soil and the wooded areas on limestone soils 
(Goodwin 1943) some of which are land covers deer 
species do not frequent. Therefore, it may be possible 
that despite high overlap with deer species, F.alnus may 
562
J. O’MAHONY ET AL.
occur in land cover less suitable; however, they should 
be monitored regularly for expansion of their ranges.
Based on the discrepancy of the findings, it is difficult 
to ascertain the exact role of climate or non-native pres­
sure on the varying fortunes of the ‘at-risk’ plant species. 
While our models suggest extinction for 50% of the plant 
species studied here based on climate, which is congru­
ent with other global studies (Román-Palacios and Wiens  
2020), it is clear that the presence and overlap of non- 
native species could further propagate such considera­
tions. Moreover, the importance of restoring functional 
ecosystems or trophic rewilding has become increas­
ingly important within the conservation debate 
(Svenning et al. 2016), with studies suggesting that 
restoring native animal populations to their functional 
roles can enhance natural carbon capture and storage, 
and potentially negate climate warming (Schmitz et al.  
2023). Extinct fauna in Ireland includes the grey wolf, the 
great elk and the brown bear, to name just a few (Hickey  
2013), meaning that the native and non-native deer 
within the (largely restricted) forest ecoystems are not 
the top-herbivore and are currently uncontrolled by any 
natural predator, which further propogates their risk to 
endangered flora. Therefore, a diversification of plant 
flora in a region, coupled with a ‘rewilding’ of the eco­
systems is currently considered the most effective man­
agement practice to support the impact of non-native 
deer species on native plants.
We only considered abiotic variables in model para­
meterization, including climate and habitat. However, 
deer are herbaceous species whose distribution is 
dependent on food sources. We did not explicitly 
include biotic factors, such as the distribution of food 
sources or competition, in the model as has been sug­
gested (Peterson et al. 2020; Soberon and Peterson  
2005). In part this was due to the fact that we wanted 
to compare the distributions of endangered and vulner­
able plant species with those of the deer species, and 
any inclusion of vegetation in parameterization of these 
distributions would have introduced circularity into the 
model. However, given the importance of climatic vari­
ables in determining deer distributions (results not 
shown), it is possible that such considerations were 
incorporated in the model as latent variables 
(Schymanski et al. 2013). While this is important to 
note, so too is the fact that perfect statistical indepen­
dence between environmental variables is perhaps 
unrealistic of real-world variables, with propagation of 
environmental variables most likely present in all SDM 
research (Holloway and Miller 2017). It is infeasible to 
omit all variables based on the assumption that they 
may already be included elsewhere in the model, and 
when coupled with the high accuracy of the models 
(Table 1), our overarching aim to accurately predict 
future distributions of these species has been achieved.
Further, we also assumed unlimited dispersal capacity 
of all species, which is in line with species who have high 
dispersal capacities or the potential for translocation by 
humans (Holloway, Miller, and Gillings 2016). We also 
note the importance of the low number of occurrences. 
While this has been found to impact distribution projec­
tions, research has found that models can be reliably and 
accurately predicted using as little as three observations 
(van Proosdij et al. 2016). To ensure a minimum standard 
of reliability, we opted to use a minimum of ten observa­
tions for the plant species. However, of the 128 species 
listed on the Red Data Plant List, only 13 had a minimum 
of ten sightings on GBIF. Future research collecting ver­
ified plant species locations that are made available 
through open data repositories is needed to improve 
model calibration and support biodiversity conservation 
and supports recent calls for more comprehensive sur­
veys and biodiversity audits in Ireland (Gaughran and 
Stout 2020).
Due to these limitations in data availability, some of 
our species reported high uncertainty in the spatial 
positioning (see Supplementary Material). As stated, 
recent research has identified that data quantity is 
more important than spatial bias and uncertainty in the 
predictive performance of SDMs (Gaul et al. 2020), mean­
ing we opted to use these data points to ensure we 
could undertake this research. Despite these caveats, 
we do report high accuracy values (Table 1), allowing 
confidence in the discussion of the important environ­
mental drivers of the plant species distributions. 
Moreover, of the three species that reported high uncer­
tainty, only P. islandica has a lower than average accu­
racy metric, meaning the uncertainty has not appeared 
to overly impact model predictions. However, both 
P. aplina and V. lathyroides are two of the species pro­
jected to go extinct, but represent two of the smallest 
current distributions of plants. More research and data 
are therefore needed to investigate whether these spe­
cies are projected to become extinct, or whether this is 
an artefact of data availability and their cryptic nature. 
Given that the 13 species included in this analysis were 
the only ones to reach a minimum number of observa­
tions, the reality is that there may be a much higher rate 
of extinction risk for flora species of conservation 
concern.
Finally, there persists a need to explore habitat suit­
ability of deer and plant species in conjunction with 
other measures of biodiversity, such as density and 
abundance. New methods, such as Poisson point pro­
cess models, are emerging as suitable tools to predict 
the distribution and abundance of species from 
ANNALS OF GIS

presence-only data (Renner and Warton 2013; Schank 
et al. 2017; Warton and Shepherd 2010). Similary, new 
data fusion techniques are being used to combine pre­
sence-only data and presence-absence across multiple 
spatial scales that are resolving some of the issues 
related to data sparsity (Morera-Pujol et al. 2022). Given 
the uncertain relationships identified, future studies 
should focus on developing predictions of both the 
distribution and density of deer to inform forest man­
agement and biodiversity conservation.
Conclusion
It has been identified that over 1 million species are 
threatened with accelerated extinction (Díaz et al.  
2019), with the spread of invasive species ranked 
as one of the primary drivers of this loss. Here we 
utilized a species distribution modelling framework, 
which is a prominent GIScience technique, to assess 
the current and future habitat suitability of four deer 
species (three non-native and one native) and 13 
endangered/vulnerable plant species. To our knowl­
edge, this is the first time this applied research has 
been undertaken at an all-Ireland scale. We then 
used the predicted future distributions to identify 
how much the deer and plant species distribution 
will overlap. We predicted large areas of current 
suitable habitat for the deer species across all coun­
ties. Future climate scenarios identified an increase 
in sika deer, while fallow deer are projected to 
reduce their distribution under climate change and 
our results predict a local extinction for muntjac. 
Also, our results predict the local extinction of six 
(out of 13) endangered and vulnerable plant species. 
Moreover, while an increase in area was identified 
for four plant species, several of these areas overlap 
with the future projections of deer species, which 
could cause further pressures on these ‘at-risk’ plant 
species. However, ‘at-risk’ plant species richness 
appeared to increase nationally, with some of the 
highest projected richness occurring in urban and 
agricultural areas. Finally, our results should support 
the conservation of these endangered/vulnerable 
plant species from the negative impact of native/ 
non-native deer species and can be used to mediate 
the impact on the ‘at-risk’ plant species through 
different conservation and management measures. 
Not only has this research provided practitioners 
with a product with which to identify areas to prior­
itize conservation activities, saving their time, 
resources and research efforts, it has also resulted 
in a better understanding of the effects of climate 
change on projected distributions and extinction 
rates.
