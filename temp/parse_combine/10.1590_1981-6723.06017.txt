Abstract 
Camu-camu (Myrciaria dubia), a fruit native to the Brazilian Amazon, is considered a source of 
antioxidant compounds. Due to its high perishability, postharvest studies aimed at increasing its shelf 
life are required. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of harvesting time on the 
conservation of the physicochemical characteristics and antioxidant compounds of camu-camu during 
cold storage. The fruits, harvested at different ripening stages (red and reddish-green peel), were 
stored in polyethylene terephthalate trays at 15 °C and 90% relative humidity. The following analyses 
were carried out on days 1, 2, 5, 7, 9 and 13 after harvest: luminosity, hue angle and chromaticity, pH, 
soluble solids content, titratable acidity, SS/TA, ascorbic acid content, total phenolic content, total 
anthocyanin content and free-radical-scavenging activity by the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazil method. 
The data were submitted to a multivariate analysis. The fruits harvested at different ripening stages 
showed different postharvest characteristics, highlighting the parameters of colour, flavour and 
antioxidants. The reddish-green fruits, despite their low concentration of anthocyanins during storage, 
showed high levels of phenolic compounds, ascorbic acid and antioxidant activity, which were 
maintained for nine days of cold storage. Due to the flavour characteristics and antioxidant compounds, 
it is recommended that camu-camu be harvested in the reddish-green maturation stage to extend its 
shelf life.

Resumo 
Camu-camu (Myrciaria dubia), uma fruta nativa da Amazônia brasileira, é considerada uma fonte de compostos 
antioxidantes. Devido à sua elevada perecibilidade, são necessários estudos em pós-colheita para aumentar a sua vida 
útil. O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar o ponto de colheita do camu-camu na conservação de suas características 
físico-químicas e compostos antioxidantes durante o armazenamento a frio. Os frutos foram colhidos em diferentes 
estádios de maturação (casca vermelha e verde-avermelhada). Os frutos foram armazenados em bandejas de 
politereftalato de etileno a 15 °C e 90% de umidade relativa. As análises foram realizadas nos dias 1, 2, 5, 7, 9 e 13, 
após a colheita: luminosidade, °hue e cromaticidade, pH, conteúdo de sólidos solúveis, acidez titulável, conteúdo de 
ácido ascórbico, conteúdo fenólico total, conteúdo total de antocianina e atividade antioxidante. Os dados foram 
submetidos à análise multivariada. Os frutos colhidos em diferentes estádios de maturação apresentaram diferentes 
características pós-colheita, destacando-se os parâmetros de cor, sabor e antioxidantes. Os frutos de cor verde-
avermelhada, apesar de sua baixa concentração de antocianinas durante o armazenamento, apresentaram altos níveis 
de compostos fenólicos, ácido ascórbico e atividade antioxidante, que foram mantidos até nove dias de 
armazenamento a frio. Devido às características de sabor e compostos antioxidantes, recomenda-se que a colheita de 
camu-camu seja no estágio de maturação verde-avermelhada, para prolongar assim a vida útil do fruto.

1 Introduction 
Camu-camu (Myrciaria dubia), a fruit native to the Brazilian Amazon, is becoming relevant in food since 
it is considered to be a promising source of antioxidant compounds, including ascorbic acid, anthocyanins, 
β-carotene and phenolic compounds (Chirinos et al., 2010). The benefits of these bioactive compounds range 
from reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular problems to stimulation of the 
immune system, decreasing platelet aggregation and blood pressure, as well as showing antibacterial and 
antiviral activities (Kuskoski et al., 2005). 
Several studies have indicated large amounts of bioactive compounds in camu-camu such as ascorbic acid 
– with concentrations higher than those found in fruits such as cherry, blackberry and acerola (Malpighia 
emarginata) (Kuskoski et al., 2005; Yuyama 2002; Ferreira et al., 2010; Neves et al., 2017; Neves et al., 
2015b). This feature is evidence of its great economic potential, putting it on the same level of importance as 
other traditional fruits of the Amazon region, such as açaí (Euterpe oleracea) and cupuaçu (Theobroma 
grandiflorum) (Vieira et al., 2011). 
However, the commercialization of fresh camu-camu fruit is limited by its short shelf life, due mainly to 
physical damage to the skin and tissues during the steps of handling and transport, resulting in weight loss 
leading to dryness and increases in the respiratory and metabolic rates. Visual changes related to perishability 
such as discolouration, loss of aroma, softening of the pulp, fruit browning and fungal growth can be observed 
up to the 4th day after harvest, negatively influencing the consumers at purchase time (Arévalo & Kieckbusch, 
2006). 
Studies to determine the optimal harvest time, as well as to evaluate ways of conserving and storing the 
fruit during the post-harvest period are essential to increase the shelf life, contributing significantly to its 
domestic and international markets (Chitarra & Chitarra, 2005). Thus the aim of this study was to evaluate 
the influence of harvest time on the conservation of the physicochemical characteristics and antioxidant 
compounds of camu-camu during cold storage.

2 Material and methods 
2.1 Raw material 
The fruits were harvested in July 2014 in the early hours of the morning, in Sete Barras, São Paulo, Brazil 
(24°23’16’’S, 47°55’33’’W), considering the colour of the peel: red (RR) and reddish-green (RG). The fruits 
were stored in plastic boxes and transported in an air-conditioned vehicle. Selection was carried out according 
to the aspects of size, peel colour, damage to the external parts, insects and other contaminants. The fruits 
were stored in polyethylene terephthalate trays (PET) (12 cm width x 19 cm length x 6 cm height x 0.6 mm 
thickness) in cold storage (Pró-Frio Industrial Refrigeration, São Paulo, SP, Brazil) at 15°C and 90% Relative 
Humidity (RH) controlled by a digital thermo-hygrometer (Testo, 608-H1, São Paulo, SP, Testo do Brasil). 
Each tray contained 0.150 kg of fruits (approximately 18 units) and each treatment (RR and RG) included 18 
trays. 
2.2 Physicochemical analyses 
The physicochemical analyses were carried out on days 1, 2, 5, 7, 9 and 13 after harvest for each treatment 
(RG1, RG3, RG5, RG7, RG9, RG13, RR1, RR3, RR5, RR7, RR9 and RR13) with 3 repetitions for each day. 
The seeds were removed manually and the peel and pulp homogenized using a mixer (Black & Decker – 
SB40). The peel colour was determined using a colorimeter (Minolta Chroma Meter CR-400) considering 
the parameters of lightness (L*), hue angle (°Hue) and chromaticity (Chroma), with 16 measurements per 
fruit. The pH was determined using a potentiometer (Marconi - MA-522), the soluble solids content (SSC) 
using a digital refractometer (Krüss Optronic - DR 201-95) and the titratable acidity (TA) by titration. The 
ratio was considered as the ratio between SSC and TA (Association of Official Analytical Chemists, 2015). 
The ascorbic acid content was determined by titration using a sodium indolfenol-2,6-dichlorophenol 
solution (DCFI) and 1.0% oxalic acid to dilute the samples. The results were expressed in g AA kg-1 of camu-
camu (Association of Official Analytical Chemists, 2015). 
The total phenolic content was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteau reagent (Singleton et al., 1999). 3 g 
of camu-camu extracts (1 mg mL-1) were mixed with 0.5 mL of Folin-Ciocalteau reagent and 2 mL of 4% 
(w/v sodium carbonate solution). After incubation in the dark at room temperature for 2 hours, the absorbance 
was measured at 740 nm using a UV–visible spectrophotometer (Femto® Plus, São Paulo, Brazil). The TPC 
was expressed as gallic acid (% w/w) equivalents (GAE) according to the gallic acid standard curve. 
The monomeric anthocyanin content was determined by the pH differential method according to AOAC 
(Association of Official Analytical Chemists, 2015), and expressed as cyanidin-3-glucoside. A 3.0 g portion 
of of camu-camu was macerated with 27.0 mL of alcohol (80%). Two macerated pulp portions of 1.2 mL 
each were weighed. One portion was mixed with 3.8 mL potassium chloride buffer (pH 1.0) and the other 
with 3.8 mL sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5). After 20 minutes of extraction at 4°C, the samples were filtered 
through Whatman N° 1 filter paper, and the absorbance measured at 520 and 700 nm, for solutions at pH 1.0 
and pH 4.5, respectively, using a UV–visible spectrophotometer (Femto® Plus, São Paulo, Brazil). The TAC 
was expressed as cyanidin-3-glucoside (mg 100g-1) equivalents. 
The free-radical-scavenging activity of camu-camu was measured using the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-
hydrazil (DPPH) method according to Mensor et al. (2001). Briefly, a 0.5 mM solution of DPPH in ethanol 
was prepared and 0.03 mL of this solution and 3.0 mL of ethanol added to 0.5 mL of the fruit extract. The 
mixture was shaken vigorously and allowed to stand at room temperature for 20 min. The absorbance was 
then determined at 575 nm using a UV–visible spectrophotometer (Femto® Plus, São Paulo, Brazil), lower 
absorbance values of reaction mixture indicating higher free-radical-scavenging activity. The results were 
expressed in µmol TEAC mg-1 of camu-camu.

2.3 Statistical analysis 
The results were submitted to the multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), the correlation analysis 
(CORR), the principal component analysis with a biplot graph (PCA) and the cluster analysis (CA). 
MANOVA was applied to compare the averages and to define the significance between the observations 
(ripening stages and storage days). CORR was carried out to evaluate the interdependence between the 
variables, calculating the correlation matrix. The PCA was used to characterize and establish the relationship 
between the ripening stages and storage days. For the CA, the cutoff was obtained using the average method 
with a euclidean distance, according to a similarity coefficient with a cutoff of 0.40. The statistical software 
used for the tests was the SAS 9.3 (Statistical Analisis System Institute, 2010). 
3. Results and discussion 
MANOVA was carried out to test the null hypothesis in order to certify there was no significant difference 
between the pairs for the variables analysed (Table 1). The null hypothesis was rejected in almost all cases, 
only being accepted for the Reddish-green/day 3 x Reddish-green/day 5 and Ripe/day 5 x Ripe/day 5 pairs. 
This test showed that (1) fruits harvested at different points in time have different post-harvest characteristics; 
and (2) these characteristics modified during cold storage. The total data group and the differences between 
the samples and variables were explained by the CORR and ACP analyses. 
For the CORR of the set of physicochemical data and antioxidant variables, 15 correlations above 0.70 
were obtained, since Sounis (1985) considers accented indexes values above |0.70| (Table 2). The variable 
TAC presented a negative correlation with Luminosity and °Hue (Table 2). The anthocyanins are coloured 
pigments ranging from red to purple, and an increase in the °Hue indicates yellow fruits and reduced levels 
of TAC. The same applies to the L* parameter, which is higher the closer it is to white, indicating a smaller 
amount of anthocyanin in the fruit. In addition to these correlations, the TAC variable was positively 
correlated to the SSC variable, since they are directly proportional. This can be explained by the degradation 
of the anthocyanins which is related to the reduction of the soluble solids content, as represented by the 
organic acids, salts, vitamins and pectin compounds. The TA variable was positively correlated to the AA 
and DPPH variables, since it represents the organic acids of the camu-camu, including ascorbic acid. The 
same was observed for the DPPH variable, which was mostly represented by organic acids.

For the CA, the observations were separated into seven groups by the cutoff fixed at 0.40, as shown by the 
dotted line (Figure 2). The same cutoff was used to separate the groups (dotted circles), as shown in the 
projection of the observations (Figure 1b). 
 
Figure 2. Observations separated into seven groups by fixing the cutoff at 0.40, as shown by the dotted line. 
The Reddish-green/day 7 and Reddish-green/day 9 reddish-green camu-camu fruits were characterized by 
high L* values, i.e., brighter (41.14 and 42.52, respectively). However, the Ripe/day 5, Ripe/day 7 and 
Ripe/day 9 fruits presented low L* values (26.03, 25.53 and 25.46, respectively) and were considered darker 
due to their anthocyanin contents. Regarding the °Hue, the Reddish-green/day 5 and Reddish-green/day 
7 fruits indicated a yellowish tonality (38.15° and 38,99°, respectively), whereas Ripe/day 5, Ripe/day 7 and 
Ripe/day 9 were characterized by a tonality closer to red (20.23°, 19.32° and 18.56°, respectively), also due 
to the presence of anthocyanins. Reddish-green/day 5, Ripe/day 5 and Ripe/day 7 presented values for 
chromaticity near the average value and Ripe/day 9 exhibited a diffuse colour (16.36) (Figure 1, Table 3). 
The same was observed for the CORR results, where the fruits harvested ripe were characterized by a redder 
and darker peel colour than those harvested in the preceding stage. The difference in the anthocyanin contents 
observed between the ripening stages studied was related to the increase in the concentration of the red pigment 
during the ripening process, which happens concurrently with the change in colour of the peel from green to red 
(Genovese et al., 2008; Andrade et al., 2010). Higher anthocyanin contents were observed in ripe camu-camu by 
Carrillo et al., (2011) and Pinto et al., (2013); in ripe acerola by Araújo et al., (2009); and in ripe blackberry by 
Siriwoharn & Wrolstad (2004). In addition, the anthocyanin levels observed in the ripe camu-camu were high and 
it must be emphasized that these high anthocyanin contents in the ripe camu-camu were maintained during cold 
storage. 
Regarding flavour, Ripe/day 5, Ripe/day 7 and Ripe/day 9 fruits were characterized by high levels of SSC 
(7.53, 7.50 and 7.03 °Brix, respectively) due to the increase in sugar concentration during the ripening 
process. The opposite was observed in the Reddish-green/day 7 and Reddish-green/day 5 fruits (6.10 and 
6.70 °Brix, respectively), harvested in the preceding stage. Ripe/day 13 fruits presented the highest value for 
the Ratio (3.74), high SSC values (7.10 °Brix) and low TA (1.88%). On the other hand, Reddish-green/day 
13 fruits showed the lowest SSC/TA ratio (3.67). Fruits with red peel have large amounts of anthocyanins 
and SSC, due to the increase in reducing sugars concomitantly with the changes in peel colour, when it 
becomes completely red (Alves et al., 2002; Rossetto et al., 2004). This same relationship between the 
anthocyanin content and SSC in camu-camu was found by Neves et al. (2015c) and Prasanna et al., (2007).

During the ripening process, the TA decreased due to the use of organic acids in fruit respiration (Prasanna 
et al., 2007). However, despite this reduction, at the TA values remained high, resulting in a low ratio value 
(Neves at al., 2015c). 
The Ripe/day 1 fruits presented the highest AA level (3417 mg 100 g-1), but by the end of storage 
(Ripe/day 13) they showed the lowest value (1989 mg 100 g-1) due to the degradation of ascorbic acid, which 
is highly sensitive to parameters such as light, heat and storage for long periods, amongst others (Silva et al., 
2006). The Ripe/day 1 and ripe/day 3 fruits were characterized by high TAC values (45.53 and 35.96%, 
respectively), and all Reddish-green/day fruits presented much lower levels of this compound. The Ripe/day 
1 fruits showed higher levels of free-radical-scavenging activity (DPPH variable) as compared to Ripe/day 
13 fruits (0.17 and 0.04 µmol TEAC mg-1, respectively) indicating the sensitivity of these compounds, 
decreasing during storage. Moreover, these fruits presented the highest values for DPPH and AA in 
comparison with the Ripe/day 13 fruits, evidencing the sensitivity of these compounds during storage. 
The Reddish-green/day fruits showed high values for antioxidant compounds such as PC and AA, and 
high antioxidant activity, despite showing low concentrations of TAC during storage. These compounds were 
preserved during cold storage in the Reddish-green/day fruits, but not in the ripe fruits. High values of 
antioxidants are associated with the exposure to biotic and abiotic stress during the fruit ripening process. 
Furthermore, maintenance of the phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity made possible by the presence 
of ascorbic acid in the fruit (Neves et al., 2015a). 
The AA peak occurred when the camu-camu reached physiological maturity or at an intermediate ripening 
stage, which justifies the maintenance of the values of this compound in the Reddish-green/day fruits 
(Bardales et al., 2008). In the ripe camu-camu fruits, the antioxidant compounds were degraded by the action 
of enzymes such as ascorbate oxidase, phenolase and cytochrome oxidase (Correa et al., 2011). The same 
results reported in this study were found in camu-camu by Chirinos et al. (2010), Rufino et al. (2010) and 
Reynertson et al. (2008). 
The camu-camu proved to be a rich source of antioxidant compounds in comparison with other native 
Brazilian tropical fruits (Neves et al., 2015b). This feature favours its marketing both in Brazil and abroad. 
In the dendrogram presented in Figure 2 a group was formed by the Ripe/day 13 and Reddish-green/day 
13 fruits, which showed that at the end of cold storage, the ripe and reddish-green fruits presented similar 
characteristics, with degradation of the antioxidant compounds on the last day. Thus, Reddish-green/day 
fruits stored for up to nine days of refrigeration showed better post-harvest characteristics. 
4 Conclusions 
The optimal ripening stage for the harvesting of camu-camu was the “reddish-green” stage in order to 
preserve its physicochemical characteristics and antioxidant activity. Moreover, the bioactive properties of 
these fruits were preserved during the first nine days of storage under refrigeration at 15 °C.
