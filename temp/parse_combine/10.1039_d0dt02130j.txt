Interaction of p-tert-butylcalix[6]areneH6, L1H6, with [TiCl4] aﬀorded the complex [Ti2Cl3(MeCN)2(OH2)
(L1H)][Ti2Cl3(MeCN)3(L1H)]·4.5MeCN (1·4.5MeCN), in which two pseudo-octahedral titanium centres are
bound to one calix[6]arene. A similar reaction but employing THF resulted in the THF ring-opened
product [Ti4Cl2(μ3-O)2(NCMe)2(L)2(O(CH2)4Cl)2]·4MeCN (2·4MeCN), where LH4 = p-tert-butylcalix[4]
areneH4. Interaction of L1H6 with [TiF4] (3 equiv.) led, after work-up, to the complex [(TiF)2(μ-F)
L1H]2·6.5MeCN (3·6.5MeCN). Treatment of p-tert-butylcalix[8]areneH8, L2H8, with [TiCl4] led to the iso-
lation of the complex [(TiCl)2(TiClNCMe)2(μ3-O)2(L2)]·1.5MeCN (4·1.5MeCN). From a similar reaction, a co-
crystallized complex [Ti4O2Cl4(MeCN)2(L2)][Ti3Cl6(MeCN)5(OH2)(L2H2)]·H2O·11MeCN (5·H2O 11MeCN) was
isolated. Extension of the L2H8 chemistry to [TiBr4] aﬀorded, depending on the stoichiometry, the com-
plexes [(TiBr)2(TiBrNCMe)2(μ3-O)2(L2)]·6MeCN (6·6MeCN) or [[Ti(NCMe)2Br]2[Ti(O)Br2(NCMe)](L2)]·7.5MeCN
(7·7.5MeCN), whilst use of [TiF4] aﬀorded complexes containing Ca2+ and Na+, thought to originate from
drying agents, namely [Ti8CaF20(OH2)Na2(MeCN)4(L2)2]·14MeCN (8·14MeCN), [Na(MeCN)2][Ti8CaF20NaO16(L2)2]·
7MeCN (9·7MeCN) or [Na]6[Ti8F20Na(MeCN)2(L2)][Ti8F20Na(MeCN)0.5(L2)]·15.5(C2H3N) (10·15.5MeCN). In
the case of [TiI4], the ladder [(TiI)2(TiINCMe)2(μ3-O)2(L2)]·7.25CH2Cl2 (11·7.25CH2Cl2) was isolated. These
complexes have been screened for their potential to act as catalysts in the ring opening polymerization
(ROP) of ε-caprolactone (ε-CL), δ-valerolactone (δ-VL) and rac-lactide (r-LA), both in air and N2. For ε-CL
and δ-VL, moderate activity at 130 °C over 24 h was observed for 1, 9 and 11; for r-LA, only 1 exhibited
reasonable activity. In the case of the co-polymerization of ε-CL with δ-VL, the complexes 1 and 11
aﬀorded reasonable conversions and low molecular weight polymers, whilst 4, 6, and 9 were less
eﬀective. None of the complexes proved to be active in the co-polymerization of ε-CL and r-LA under
the conditions employed herein.
Introduction
Frameworks capable of binding multiple metal centres are of
interest in catalysis given the potential for beneficial coopera-
tive eﬀects.1 Our interest in this area has been, and remains,
focused mostly around the use of the family of polyphenolic
macrocycles called calix[n]arenes.2 For the n = 4 system,
namely p-tert-butylcalix[4]areneH4 (LH4), the tendency is to
coordinate to only one metal centre via the four phenolic
oxygens (the lower rim) and usually the macrocycle retains the
cone conformation.3 Of the larger calix[n]arenes, the n = 6
(L1H6) and 8 (L2H8) systems are attractive scaﬀolds given their
availability; odd numbered calix[n]arenes are isolated in far
lower yields.4 However, the coordination chemistry of the
larger calix[n]arenes remains relatively unexplored.2,5 In the
case of titanium, reports date back to the 1980s.6 In our
coordination studies employing diﬀerent metals (i.e. tungsten
and vanadium), we have had limited success for n = 6,7 whilst
previous work for n = 8 has shown that it is possible, via con-
trolling the reaction stoichiometry, to incorporate selectively
two, three, or four metal centres (W) at the lower rim.8
Furthermore, the systems incorporating vanadium have exhibi-
ted high catalytic activities in the area of α-olefin polymeriz-
ation.9 In the area of ring opening polymerization (ROP) of
cyclic esters, reports using metallocalix[n]arenes are scant. In

the case of tungstocalix[6 and 8]arenes, we observed how
diﬀerent sized calixarene rings and their associated confor-
mations can drastically aﬀect the catalytic activity for the ROP
of ε-caprolactone (ε-CL).10 More recently, McIntosh et al.
reported preliminary studies on the use of the complex [Ti4(L2)
(On-Pr)8(THF)2] as a catalyst for the ROP of rac-lactide (r-LA) at
130 °C.11 Other titanocalix[n]arene work in this area employs
the de-tert-butylated n = 4 system (1,3-di-n-propylcalix[4]arene),
with well-behaved ROP of rac-lactide observed when employing
either microwave radiation or heat; the former method was
beneficial to the rate of polymerization at the expense of
control.12 A related system, possessing para-NO2 and tert-butyl
groups at the upper-rim of the calix[4]arene was capable of the
well-controlled ROP of
L- and r-LA under solvent-free con-
ditions.13 Recently, we have tested the eﬃciency of known
complexes of the type [TiCl2L(O)2(OR)2] (R = Me, n-Pr and
n-pentyl), the Cl-bridged compound {[TiL(O)3(OR)]2(μ-Cl)2}
(R = n-decyl) and the monochloride complex [Ti(NCMe)ClL
(O)3(OMe)] in the ROP of several cyclic esters.14 Although all
complexes were found to be eﬃcient for ROP, the monochlor-
ide species proved to be the best performing of the series. It is
noteworthy that all catalysts were shown to be active even
under aerobic conditions, without any significant activity loss.
Moreover, titanocalix[4]arene species were shown to be better
performing than other Ti-based benchmark catalysts (includ-
ing a Ti-diphenolate compound), suggesting a positive eﬀect
of the calix[4]arene ligand on the catalyst eﬃciency. These
limited studies suggest there is the potential for accessing
both controllable and highly active ROP catalysts based on tita-
nocalix[n]arenes with n ≥6. Herein, we focus on titanocalix[6
and 8]arenes derived from interaction of the parent p-tert-
butylcalix[6 and 8]arenes, namely n = 6 (L1H6) and n = 8 (L2H8)

with the tetrahalides [TiX4] (X = Cl, Br, F, I). A number of intri-
guing molecular structures (see Chart 1 and Fig. S1 and 2,
ESI†) have been identified, and the complexes (not 2, 5, 7, and
8) have been screened for their ability to act as catalysts in the
ROP of ε-CL, δ-valerolactone (δ-VL), and r-LA as well as for the
copolymerization of ε-CL with δ-VL, and ε-CL with r-LA. We
have recently reviewed the use of titanium diphenolates and
titanocalix[4]arenes for both α-olefin polymerization and the
ROP of cyclic esters.15
Results and discussion
Use of p-tert-butylcalix[6]areneH6 L1H6
In the case of L1H6, where L1 = p-tert-butylcalix[6]arene, inter-
action with two equivalents of [TiCl4] aﬀorded, after work-up
(MeCN), the complex [Ti2Cl3(MeCN)2(OH2)(L1H)] [Ti2Cl3(MeCN)3
(L1H)]·4.5 MeCN (1·4.5 MeCN) as orange crystals on slow
cooling to ambient temperature. In the IR spectrum, v(CN) for
both
coordinated
and
free
acetonitrile
(2319/2308
and
2289 cm−1, respectively) are observed. The molecular structure
(CCDC 1973136†) of 1 is shown in Fig. 1, with selected bond
lengths and angles given in the caption. The asymmetric unit
contains two similar but unique molecules. In each case, the
two pseudo-octahedral Ti(IV) ions are bound to an L1H ligand
via three phenolate oxygens to each titanium ion; the co-
ordinated chlorides, acetonitrile molecules and water molecule
are facial. In each molecule; the phenolic hydrogens on O(2)
and O(2A) are retained, whilst Ti(1) is bonded to two Cl−ions
and one water molecule, Ti(1A) is bonded to two Cl−ions and
one MeCN molecule, and this is the chemical diﬀerence
between the two unique metal complexes; Ti(2) and Ti(2A) are
both bonded to one Cl−ion and two MeCN molecules. There
are hydrogen bonds between O(2)–H(2)⋯O(6A) and O(2A)–H
(2A)⋯O(6). The retention of a phenolic hydrogen on L1, allows
for hydrogen bonding with an oxygen on the other molecule in
the asymmetric unit, or the next pair along the chain. These
pairs of molecules form infinite, H-bonded, zig-zag chains, in
the b-direction (see Fig. S3, ESI†). The coordination of the
metal to the calix[6]arene and the conformation adopted by
the macrocycle are reminiscent of that observed for the group
V complexes {[M(NCMe)Cl2]2L1} (M = Nb, Ta).16 When THF
was employed as solvent, the orange/red complex [Ti4Cl2(μ3-
O)2(NCMe)2(L)2(O(CH2)4Cl)2]·4MeCN (2·4MeCN) was isolated
in low yield. Its molecular structure (CCDC 1973134†) is
shown in Fig. S4 of the ESI.† The molecule lies on a centre of
symmetry, and was refined as a 2-component twin (com-
ponents 0.5431 : 0.4569(10)); component 2 rotated by 8.1802°
around [−0.01 0.98 0.18] (reciprocal) or [0.20 0.92 0.33]
(direct). The core of the complex can be described as two,
singly vertex–vacant cubes, connected by a face, in which the
Ti octahedra share edges. Both Ti(2) and Ti(2A) possess
O(CH2)4Cl groups. The main core of 2 was found to be similar
to
that
of
[Ti(NCMe)(μ3-O)L(O)4TiCl(O(CH2)4Cl)]2–2[TiCl
(NCMe)(L(O)3(On-Pr))]·11MeCN, a compound we have recently
reported.14 The formation of 2 is thought to involve the ring
opening of the THF, which has been reported in the literature
for a number of systems, particularly in the presence of Lewis
acids and more recently in the reaction between boryl triflates
and aryloxides.17 The presence of a calix[4]arene rather than a
calix[6]arene is thought to be due to the presence of a small
amount of the n = 4 macrocycle in the batch of the precursor
used. In the case of [TiF4] (3 equiv.), reaction with L1H6
aﬀorded, following extraction into MeCN, the orange/red
complex [(TiF)2(μ-F)L1H]2·6.5MeCN (3·6.5MeCN). The mole-
cular structure (CCDC 2009076†) is shown in Fig. 2, with
selected bond lengths and angles given in the caption. The
molecule lies on a centre of symmetry and so half is unique.
Two distorted octahedral titanium centres are bound to each
of the two L1H macrocycles, the latter being linked by

H-bonds. The central core can be described as two Ti2F2 dia-
monds, which bridge the calixarenes, whilst two fluoride ions
bridge the two diamonds. The Ti–F bonds are somewhat
longer than those found in the [O, NPy, N]-bearing Ti com-
plexes recently reported by Solan et al.18 The MeCNs contain-
ing N(1) and N(2) reside in the calixarene cavity.
Use of p-tert-butylcalix[8]areneH8 L2H8
Use of [TiCl4]. Reaction of p-tert-butylcalix[8]areneH8 (L2H8)
with [TiCl4] (four equivalents) in refluxing toluene aﬀords, fol-
lowing work-up (extraction into MeCN), small red crystals in
moderate yield. A single crystal X-ray diﬀraction study revealed
the complex to be the laddered species [(TiCl)2(TiClNCMe)2(μ3-
O)2(L2)]·1.5MeCN (4·1.5MeCN) (CCDC 1973133†), and this
formula represents the asymmetric unit, see Fig. 3. The Ti(1)
and Ti(4) centres are pseudo-octahedral with trans Cl and
MeCN ligands, whilst Ti(2) & Ti(3) are square-based pyramidal
with apical Cl ligands. The result is a central Ti4O4 ladder,
which is supported by the fully deprotonated saddle-shaped L2
ligand. Such ladders have been observed previously in p-tert-
butylcalix[4 and 6]arene titanium chemistry.19 The Cl ligands
on the two central Ti centres both point the same way, while
those on the terminal Ti centres point the opposite way (see
ESI, Fig. S5†). We have recently reported the same complex,
however on that occasion it could only be isolated as a co-crys-
tallized mixture (35 : 65) with a silicone grease derived complex
[Ti(NCMe)Cl]2[Ti(μ-O)]2[OSi(CH3)2OSi(CH3)2O]L2] in which the
grease replaces two chloride ligands.20
Some weak C–H⋯Cl intermolecular interactions parallel to
a bind molecules into anti-parallel stacks (see ESI, Fig. S6†). In
one preparation of 4, following work-up and crystallization
from
MeCN,
the
isolated
crystals
were
identified
as
[Ti4O2Cl4(MeCN)2(L2)][Ti3Cl6(MeCN)5(OH2)
(L2H2)][OH2]·11MeCN (5·11MeCN; CCDC 1973135†). The asym-
metric unit of 5 contains 2 diﬀerent molecules (Fig. 4). In one
molecule there is a ladder structure, like 4, made up of four
Ti(IV) ions and phenolate oxygens (from the L2 ligand) and
bridging oxygens, O(3), O(7), O(9), and O(10). The latter two
are oxo dianions. Ti(1) and Ti(4) each carry 1 Cl−ion and one
MeCN ligand; Ti(2) and Ti(3) each carry one Cl−ion. In the
other molecule, three Ti(IV) ions are coordinated to a L2H2
ligand via 6 phenolate oxygens (two per Ti); and oxygens O(17)
and O(18) remain protonated. Ti(5) and Ti(6) are each co-
ordinated to two Cl−ions and two MeCN ligands, and Ti(7) is
coordinated to two Cl−ions, one MeCN ligand and one water
molecule. There are two intramolecular H-bonds: O(18)–H(18)
⋯O(17) and O(17)–H(17)⋯Cl(9), and a lone water molecule sits
between the two titanium-calixarene molecules. The H atoms
could not be located for this or the coordinated water mole-
cule, but both appear to form reasonable H-bonds: O(19)⋯N
(5) = 2.681, O(19)⋯O(20) = 2.759, and O(20)⋯Cl(1) = 3.525 Å.
In terms of intermolecular interactions between molecules,
the water molecule between the two diﬀerent calix[8]arene
complexes hydrogen bonds to the coordinated water molecule.
The coordinated water molecule H-bonds to an acetonitrile
molecule of crystallization.
Use of [TiBr4]. Similar use of [TiBr4] with L2H8 led to a very
similar ladder complex (see Fig. 5), with crystallization from
MeCN
aﬀording
[(TiBr)2(TiBrNCMe)2(μ3-O)2(L2)]·6MeCN
(6·6MeCN), which is the asymmetric unit (CCDC 1973132†).
Both coordinated MeCN groups point to the same side of
the molecule, whilst the six MeCN molecules of crystallization
are all exo to the complex. Molecules pack in layers. Adjacent

molecules within layers adopt up–down–up–down orientations
(see Fig. S7, ESI†). Between layers molecules stack in columns
all pointing in the same direction with weak Br(1)⋯Br(2′) =
3.770 Å halogen bonding interactions. Given the addition of
diﬀering amounts of metal chloride to a calix[n]arene can be
used to control the degree of metalation,8 we also investigated
the addition of three equivalents of [TiBr4]. This resulted, fol-
lowing work-up (MeCN), in the formation of brown prisms for
which a molecular structure determination revealed the asym-
metric
unit
{[TiBr2(H2O)(NCMe)][TiBr2(NCMe)2Ti]2L2H2}·7.5
(MeCN) 7·7.5(MeCN), see Fig. 6 (CCDC 1973131†). The calix[8]
arene ligand retains two phenolic hydrogens on oxygens O(7)
and O(8), which are not bound to titanium ions. Three TiBr2
moieties bind to the L2H2 via two phenolate oxygens each.
Each Ti ion has octahedral geometry. The bromides are trans
on Ti(1) and Ti(2), but cis on Ti(3).

The remaining coordination sites are occupied by MeCN
ligands in the case of Ti(2) and Ti(3), while Ti(1) bears one
MeCN and most likely a water molecule. No peaks corres-
ponding to carbon atoms were evident close to that water
molecule that would have indicated MeCN. There is one intra-
molecular hydrogen bond between one of the phenol groups
and one of the coordinated bromide ions. The other phenolic
hydrogen does not make a hydrogen bond. Molecules are
arranged in an undulating layer structure in the a/c plane (see
Fig. S8,† ESI).
Use of [TiF4]. Use of [TiF4] and L2H8 led, following work-up
in MeCN, to more complicated species in which both sodium
and calcium have been incorporated. The presence of these
alkali/alkaline earth metals is thought to arise from the pre-
drying of the solvents, namely toluene and acetonitrile respect-
ively. The small red prisms obtained were subjected to an X-ray
diﬀraction study (CCDC 1973130†), and two views of the mole-
cular structure of 8 are given in Fig. 7 (an alternative view is
given in the ESI, Fig. S9†); selected bond lengths and angles
are given in the caption. The complex has the formula
[Ti8CaF20(OH2)Na2(MeCN)4(L2)2]·14MeCN
(8·14MeCN),
and
lies on a mirror plane, which includes atoms Ca(1), Na(1),
Na(2), some of the fluoride ions and the water molecule. The
main core of the molecule comprises 8 titanium ions and 20
fluoride ions (a mixture of terminal and bridging), see Fig. 7.
Each titanium ion binds to a L2 ligand via two phenolate
oxygens, and each L2 binds to four octahedral titanium ions.
The oxygens bound to each individual titanium atom are cis. A
calcium ion and two sodium ions are present to balance out
the overall charge. The part of the core of the molecule con-
taining the Ca2+ ion is antifluorite-like with the Ca2+ co-
ordinated by 9 F ions. Na(1) interacts with fluorides F(6) and

F(6A), and three acetonitrile molecules: via N(1), N(1A), and
N(2). Na(2) interacts with fluorides F(8) and F(8A), water mole-
cule O(9), and three acetonitrile molecules: containing N(4),
N(5), and N(5A). The H atoms on the water molecule could not
be located from diﬀerence maps. The water molecule bridges
the calcium ion and one of the sodium ions. Four of the calix-
arene rings of each separate calixarene, bound to O atoms
O(3), O(3A), O(4), and O(4A) on one, and O(5), O(5A), O(6), and
O(6A) on the other, are close in space and adopt the same con-
formation, stacking almost exactly on top of each other, see
Fig. 8 and S9, ESI.† The titanocalix[8]arene molecules are gen-
erally well separated, with no significant intermolecular inter-
actions between them. Viewed perpendicular to b/c plane, it
can be seen that there are significant solvent filled voids in the
structure (Platon Squeeze recovers 291 electrons in 2 voids,
giving 14 MeCNs per unit cell or an extra 7 MeCNs per Ti8
complex), see Fig. S10, ESI.† 21
We note that Ti–F complexes in which alkaline or alkaline-
earth metal ions are featured in the structure in a host–guest
fashion have been previously reported.22 However, these
species were intentionally synthesized in a template-controlled
manner, while the Na+ and Ca2+ ions present in 8 are likely to
derive from the drying agents of the solvents used for the reac-
tion/workup and are serendipitously incorporated into the
structure.
To investigate the reproducibility of such species, we
repeated the reaction (using the same batch of L2H8) and
again isolated red prisms. However, on this occasion the asym-
metric
unit
(CCDC

Fig. 9, and unlike 8·14MeCN, it is not on a mirror plane,
i.e. the whole molecule is unique, although there are also
many similarities. The main core of the molecule again
comprises 8 titanium ions and 20 fluoride ions with the
fluorides a mixture of terminal and bridging Ti(3) and Ti(4)

to an L2 ligand via two phenolate oxygens; each L2 binds to 4
titanium atoms. The oxygens bound to each individual tita-
nium atom are cis. A calcium ion and two sodium ions are
present to balance out the overall charge. The part of the core
of the molecule containing the Ca2+ ion (see Fig. 10) is anti-
fluorite-like with the Ca2+ coordinated by 11 F−ions, rather
than the 9 in 8. Na(1) interacts with fluoride F(1), phenolate
oxygen O(1), two ipso phenolate carbons C(1) and C(78), and
the π-system of phenolate ring C(67) > C(72). Na(2) binds to
two acetonitrile molecules, via N(1) and N(2), as a separate
moiety in fairly close proximity to the Ca2+ ion and its co-
ordinated fluorides.
Again, as in 8, four of the calixarene rings of each separate
calixarene, bound to O atoms O(5) > O(8) on one, and O(9) >
O(12) on the other, are close in space and adopt the same con-
formation, stacking almost exactly on top of each other. MeCN
molecules and MeCN-solvated Na+ ions lie between titanocalix
[8]arene complexes.
The complex [Na]6[Ti8F20Na(MeCN)2(L2)]-[Ti8F20Na(MeCN)0.5
(L2)]·15.5(C2H3N) (10·15.5MeCN) has also been isolated and
structurally characterized (see Fig. 11) from a re-run of this
type of reaction, indicating that the products formed are vari-
able and their exact nature is determined by the presence of
drying agents in the solvents. For 10, there are negative
charges: 2 × calix[8] = 16−, 20 × F−= 20−, total 36−; positive
charges: 8 × Ti4+ = 32+, and 1 × Na+ gives a total of 33+. It is
assumed that there are also another 3 Na+ ions to balance the
charge and these are modelled by the Platon Squeeze pro-
cedure due to disorder and being randomly distributed
between the MeCN molecules of crystallization.21 The amount
of MeCN of crystallization should be regarded as approximate.
There are two almost identical molecules in the asymmetric
unit, diﬀering only in the coordination site of the sodium ion
and the number of acetonitrile molecules bonded to the
sodium. The main core of each molecule is made up of 8 tita-
nium ions and 20 fluorides as seen previously in 8 and 9 (see
Fig. 12, and Fig. S11, ESI†). Two titanium ions have 2 terminal
fluorides and 2 bridging fluorides, four titanium ions have 1
terminal fluoride and 3 bridging fluorides, and the remaining
two titanium ions have 4 bridging fluorides. Each titanium ion
binds to a L2 ligand via two phenolate oxygens; and each L2
binds to 4 titanium ions. Each Ti ion has octahedral geometry.
The oxygens bound to each individual titanium atom are cis. In
the first molecule, sodium ion Na(1) interacts with fluoride F(6)
and two acetonitrile molecules including N(5) and N(9). In the
second molecule, the major occupancy site of disordered sodium
ion Na(2) interacts with fluorides F(25) and F(28), and the aceto-
nitrile molecule including N(11), which was refined at half occu-
pancy to match that of the major Na(2) component. Each pair of
calixarene rings, on each titanium–fluoride core, are close in
space and adopt the same conformation, stacking almost exactly
on top of each other as seen previously (see Fig. 12 and S12,
ESI†). MeCN molecules lie between titanocalixarene complexes.
Also in this case, the Ti–F bonds for complexes 8–10 are slightly
longer than those observed in previously reported compounds.18
Use of [TiI4]. Treatment of L2H8 with four equivalents of
[TiI4] in toluene aﬀorded, following work-up in dichloro-
methane, a dark red complex which was isolated as large
blocks. Interestingly, the molecular structure revealed (see
Fig. 13) a ladder complex similar to that observed for the chlor-
ide and bromide systems. The asymmetric unit comprises
[Ti4I4O2(MeCN)2(L2)]·7.25(CH2Cl2)
(11·7.25CH2Cl2;
CCDC
1973364†). There are CH2Cl2 molecules both in calixarene
clefts and exo to the calix[8]arene. There are some C–H⋯π
interactions involving CH2Cl2 to calixarene rings. The mole-
cules form layers in the a/c plane (see Fig. S13, ESI†).

Table 1 summarises the Ti–X bond length data from the
four ladder structures described above. There are two main
observations. Firstly, the Ti–X bond length increases by
approx. 0.2 Å on going from Cl to Br and from Br to I, in line
with the ionic radius increases as Group 17 is descended.
Secondly, the Ti–X bond lengths for the halide attached to the
six-coordinate end Ti ions, and trans to an MeCN nitrogen, is
significantly longer (by 0.07–0.12 Å) than those for the apical
halide attached to the central, five-coordinate, Ti ions with
approx. square-based pyramidal geometry.
For catalysis comparison purposes, we have synthesised two
diphenolate complexes bearing Br and I labile ligands, namely
12 and 13 (Scheme 1).
For the bromo-derivative 12, crystals suitable for X-ray ana-
lysis were obtained at room temperature from a saturated solu-
tion of the compound in hexane. The molecular structure of
the complex (CCDC 2009076†) is shown in Fig. 14. The com-
pound features a tetrahedral Ti4+ ion. The complex molecule
and the hexane of crystallization both lie on a mirror plane, so
half of the formula is unique. The dihedral angle between aro-
matic rings was found to be 64°. The hexane molecule lies in
the cleft between the two aromatic rings. There is a weak inter-
molecular C–H⋯Br interaction between the methyl group at
C(16) and Br(1) with an H(16A)⋯Br(1) distance of 3.05 Å.

temperature to 130 °C, 69% conversion was achieved in the
presence of 1 in 24 h, while low activity was observed after 1 h
(runs 3 and 5). Interestingly, the complex proved to be active
also under aerobic conditions achieving ca. 20% conversion
during 24 h (run 4). The Mn of the isolated polymers were
found to be lower than the calculated values, while narrow
polydispersities (1.20) were observed. Complex 3 was found to
be inactive (run 6). Amongst the larger titanocalix[8]arene com-
plexes, moderate conversion of the monomer was achieved
only in the presence of 9 and with its iodo-congener 11 (63
and 74%, runs 13 and 15 respectively), while both chloro- and
bromo-derivatives were found to be inactive. The higher
activity of 1 compared with that of 4 and 6 can be explained
considering the lability of the ligands present. In fact, the Ti
ions in 1 are bound either to MeCN or H2O, which are more
readily lost than the halides in 4 and 6. Similarly, the lability
of the iodo-ligands would be responsible for the higher activity
of 11 compared to that of its Cl- and Br-containing analogues.
This is in line with our recent study on titanocalix[4]arenes, in
which the presence of a labile ligand (i.e. MeCN) proved ben-
eficial for the catalyst activity.14 In addition, the arrangement
of and distance between the two Ti centers in 1 could favour
cooperative eﬀects enhancing the catalytic performances. On
the other hand, this might not be possible for 4, 6, and 11
in which the metals are connected in a [Ti–O–Ti] fashion.
Similar trends were observed in the case of multimetallic Al
complexes bearing macrocyclic Schiﬀ-bases, where both the
distance
and
bond
types
present
dictated
the
observed
activity.23 The eﬃciency of 9 is thought to be due to coopera-
tive eﬀects of the Ti and of Ca/Na cations present in the
structure.
The bromo-(12) and iodo-(13) diphenolate titanium com-
plexes were next investigated. Full conversion was achieved in
the presence of the bromo derivative 12 at 80 °C within 24 h
(run 17) aﬀording a polymer with Mn of ca. 6.7 kDa and rather
narrow polydispersity (1.40). Interestingly, complex 12 proved
to be eﬃcient also under aerobic conditions at 130 °C, but
with less control (run 18). However, in both cases, the Mn were
found to be much lower than the calculated values, suggesting
the occurrence of transesterification processes. 1H NMR spec-
troscopic analysis on the sample isolated in run 16 highlighted
the presence of signals at 7.33, 5.09 and 3.64 ppm in an inte-
gration ratio of 5 : 2 : 2, compatible with the presence of
both BnO– and CH2OH end groups (Fig. S14, ESI†). This was
further
confimed
by
mass
spectrometry.
Indeed,
the
MALDI-ToF spectrum of the sample displayed a major series
of peaks separated by 114 m/z units accountable to α-BnO-
ω-OH terminated PCL n-mers as well as a minor population
attributed to the corresponding Na+ adducts (Fig. S15, ESI†).
The iodo-congener 13 was shown to be less eﬃcient, aﬀording
40% conversion at 80 °C (run 19) and low molecular weight oli-
gomers. Interestingly, full conversion was achieved on increas-

ing the temperature to 130 °C, aﬀording a polymer of Mn
5.6 kDa with good control (Mw/Mn 1.30) (run 20). The higher
activity of the diphenolate complexes can be ascribed to the
increased accessibility of their metal centres compared with
that of the calix[n]arene derivatives. However, 12 and 13 proved
less active than related diphenolate species previously reported
by Aida et al.24
δ-Valerolactone
(δ-VL).
Furthermore,
the
ROP
of
δ-valerolactone (δ-VL) was investigated (Table 3). Similar to the
ε-CL case, 1 was found to be poorly active at 80 °C (runs 1 and
2). By increasing the temperature to 130 °C and lowering the
monomer to catalyst ratio, moderate conversion was achieved
in 24 h (run 3). For the isolated polymer, narrow polydispersity
(1.13) and Mn higher than the calculated value were observed.
No conversion was achieved by preforming the reaction in air
(run 4). Also in this case, 3 and 4 were found to be inactive
(runs 5–9) while poor activity was exhibited by its Br-congener
(runs 10–13). Moderate activity was exhibited by 9 over 24 h,
aﬀording a polymer of Mn close to the calculated values and
with good selectivity (run 14). No reaction was observed after
1 h (run 15). Interestingly, ca. 70% conversion was obtained in
the presence of 11 over 24 h (run 16). The Mn value was higher
than the expected value and good control was observed. In the
case of the di-phenolate derivatives 12 and 13, at 80 °C within
24 h, only 52 and 41% conversion was achieved in the presence
of the Br- and I-complexes, respectively (runs 18 and 20). The
improvement of the conversion was obtained on increasing
the temperature to 130 °C (runs 19 and 21). In fact, 64 and
53% conversion was achieved with 12 and 13, respectively.
In both cases, polymers with Mn lower than the calculated
values were isolated; however, better control was exhibited by
13 compared with its bromo-congener (Mw/Mn 1.4 vs. 1.9).
rac-Lactide
(r-LA).
The
selected
complexes
were
also
employed as catalysts in the ROP of r-LA (Table 4). Good con-
version was achieved in the presence of 1 (87%, run 1). The Mn
of the polymer was lower than the calculated value albeit with
narrow molecular weight distribution (8000 and 1.29, respect-
ively). The syndiotactic bias (Pr) was determined by 2D
J-resolved NMR spectroscopy (see Fig. S16, ESI†).25 The
observed value (0.51) suggested the formation of atactic PL. No
reaction was observed when employing 3, 4, and the bromide
complex 6, regardless of the reaction conditions investigated
(runs 3–11). Unlike the previous cases, 9 was found to be com-
pletely inactive (runs 12 and 13). Eventually, 8% conversion
was obtained in the presence of 11 over 24 h (run 14). On con-
ducting the reaction in the presence of the bromotitanium
diphenolate complex 12, complete monomer conversion was
achieved, aﬀording a polymer with Mn of ca. 5.0 kDa with
narrow dispersity (run 16). On the other hand, the iodo-conge-
ner only allowed for 37% monomer conversion aﬀording low
molecular weight species.
ε-CL/δ-VL co-polymerization. The co-polymerization of ε-CL
and δ-VL was next investigated (Table 5). Moderate conversion
(68%) was achieved in the presence of 1 (run 1) aﬀording a

polymer with low molecular weight and narrow polydispersity.
The
1H NMR spectroscopic analyses of the crude reaction
mixture suggested a CL : VL ratio in the copolymer of 40 : 60.
No conversion was achieved when employing complex 3 (run
2). Low conversions, spanning from 20 to 40% were observed
by using the titanocalix[8]arene complexes 4, 6, and 9 (runs
3–5). In all cases, the CL : VL ratio was found to be ca. 1 : 1.
However, the molecular weights of such co-polymers were too
low to be detected by SEC, suggesting the occurrence of unde-
sirable transesterification side-reactions resulting in the for-
mation of light oligomers. Finally, good conversion was
achieved by using 11 (81%, run 6). Similar to 1, the catalyst
was shown to incorporate ε-CL and δ-VL in 1 : 1 ratio. The
average sequence length for CL was found to be 2.46 while the
value for VL was 1.69, as observed by 13C NMR spectroscopy
(ESI, Fig. S17† and eqn (S1)–(S3)†).26 The randomness degree
for the co-polymer was 1.0, compatible with a purely random
copolymer.26a
In the presence of the bi-phenolate complexes 12 and 13,
complete
conversion
was
observed
(runs
7
and
8),
aﬀording co-polymers with Mn spanning from 12 to 14 kDa
with rather poor control (Mw/Mn ca.1.75). Also in this case, the
co-polymer composition was analyzed by
13C NMR spec-
troscopy. For the polymer isolated with 12, the average
sequence length was 2.10 and 2.05 for CL and VL, respectively
(ESI, Fig. S18†), with a randomness degree of 0.97, compatible
with a purely random co-polymer.26a A similar outcome was
achieved with complex 13; in fact, the average sequence
lengths were 2.50 and 1.82 for CL and CL, respectively, with a
randomness degree of 0.95 (ESI, Fig. S19†).

130 °C. In most cases, both monomers were unreacted after
24 h. Nevertheless, 14% conversion of r-LA in PLA was
achieved in the presence of 1, as highlighted by 1H NMR spec-
troscopy on the crude reaction mixture (see Fig. S20, ESI†).
Conclusion
The treatment of L1H6 with [TiCl4] aﬀorded complex 1·4.5MeCN,
in which two pseudo-octahedral titanium centres are bound to
one calix[6]arene. A similar preparation conducted in THF
resulted in the THF ring-opened product 2·4MeCN, containing an
LH4- (where LH4 = p-tert-butylcalix[4]areneH4) derived ligand
resulted from impurities in L1H6. In the case of [TiF4] (3 equiv.),
reaction with L1H6 aﬀorded the orange/red complex 3·6.5MeCN,
in which two Ti2F2 diamonds bridge the calixarenes, whilst two
fluoride ions bridge the two diamonds. The reaction between
L2H8, with [TiCl4] led to [(TiCl)2(TiClNCMe)2(μ3-O)2(L2)]·1.5MeCN
(4·1.5MeCN) and, from a similar preparation, to the co-crystal-
lized
complex
[Ti4O2Cl4(MeCN)2(L2)][Ti3Cl6(MeCN)5(OH2)
(L2H2)]·H2O·11MeCN (5·H2O 11MeCN). Extension of the L2H8
chemistry to [TiBr4] aﬀorded, depending on the stoichiometry,
[(TiBr)2(TiBrNCMe)2(μ3-O)2(L2)]·6MeCN
(6·6MeCN)
or
[Ti(NCMe)2Br]2[Ti(O)Br2(NCMe)](L2)]·7.5MeCN
(7·7.5MeCN),
respectively. Interestingly, the use of [TiF4] aﬀorded com-
plexes containing Ca2+ and Na+, most likely deriving from
drying agents, namely [Ti8CaF20(OH2)Na2(MeCN)4(L2)2]·14MeCN
(8·14MeCN), [Na(MeCN)2][Ti8CaF20NaO16(L2)2]·7MeCN (9·7MeCN)
or [Na]6[Ti8F20Na(MeCN)2(L2)][Ti8F20Na(MeCN)0.5(L2)]·15.5(C2H3N)
(10·15.5MeCN). By using [TiI4], the ladder 11·7.25CH2Cl2 was iso-
lated. These complexes have been tested as catalysts in the ring
opening polymerization (ROP) of ε-CL, δ-VL and r-LA, both in air
and N2. In the case of ε-CL, high temperatures (130 °C) over 24 h
were required to achieve reasonable conversions for 1, 9 and 11
(3 and 6 were inactive). However, these metallocalix[n]arenes are
out-performed by the diphenolates 12 and 13, which doubtless
reflects the accessiblity of the metal centres in the latter. In the
case of δ-VL, the salts 9 and 10 as well as 12 and 13 perform
best, whilst for r-LA, 1, 12 and to a lesser extent 11, 13 were
active. For the copolymerization of ε-CL with δ-VL reasonable
activity was exhibited by 1 and 11, whilst conversions lower
than 40% were observed with the other complexes; all aﬀorded
low molecular weight polymers. The copolymerization of ε-CL
with r-LA was unsuccessful regardless of the catalyst employed.
In general for these systems, more accessible metals centres
(e.g. 1, 12 and 13) and the formation of salts (e.g. 9–11) favours
improved catalytic performance in the ROP of cyclic esters.
Experimental section
General
All manipulations were carried out under an atmosphere of
dry nitrogen using conventional Schlenk and cannula tech-
niques or in a conventional nitrogen-filled glove box. Hexane
and toluene were refluxed over sodium. Acetonitrile was
refluxed over calcium hydride. All solvents were distilled and
degassed prior to use. IR spectra (nujol mulls, KBr windows)
were recorded on a Nicolet Avatar 360 FT IR spectrometer; 1H
NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Varian
VXR 400 S spectrometer at 400 MHz or a Gemini 300 NMR
spectrometer or a Bruker Advance DPX-300 spectrometer at
300 MHz. The 1H NMR spectra were calibrated against the
residual protio impurity of the deuterated solvent. Elemental
analyses were performed by the elemental analysis service at
the London Metropolitan University and in the Department of
Chemistry, the University of Hull. All chemicals were pur-
chased from either Sigma Aldrich or TCI UK.

To L2H6 (2.00 g, 2.05 mmol) in toluene (30 mL) was added
[TiCl4] (0.71 mL, 6.50 mmol) and the system was refluxed for
12 h. On cooling, the volatiles were removed in-vacuo, and the
residue was extracted into MeCN (30 mL). On standing at
ambient temperature (ca. 10 °C) for 2 days, orange crystals of 1
formed. Yield 1.80 g, 64%. Sample dried under reduced

Synthesis of [Ti4Cl2(μ3-O)2(NCMe)2(L)2(O(CH2)4Cl)2]·4MeCN
(2·4MeCN)
Crystals of complex 2 suitable for X ray analysis were obtained
in low yield (<5%) from the preparation of 1. Due to the
limited amount of sample (∼5 mg), only 1H NMR spectroscopy
analysis could be performed. 1H NMR (C6D6) δ: 7.20–7.05 (m,

Synthesis of [(TiF)2(μ-F)L1H]2·6.5MeCN (3·6.5MeCN)
To L2H6 (2.00 g, 2.05 mmol) in toluene (30 mL) was added
[TiF4] (0.76 g, 6.14 mmol) and the system was refluxed for
12 h. On cooling, the volatiles were removed in-vacuo, and the
residue was extracted into MeCN (30 mL). On standing at
ambient temperature at 0 °C for 2 days, orange/red crystals of
3 formed. Yield 1.75 g, 68%. C132H158F6O12Ti4·3MeCN (sample
dried in vacuo for 2 h, −3.5MeCN) requires C 70.07, H 7.12, N

Ring open polymerization (ROP) procedures
Typical polymerization procedures are as follows. Under nitro-
gen atmosphere, a Schlenk tube was charged with a toluene
solution of the catalyst (10 mM) and the required amount of a
toluene solution of benzyl alcohol (18 mM). The mixture was
stirred for 2 min at room temperature, then the monomer
(4.5 mmol) along with 1.5 mL toluene was added. The mixture
was then placed into an oil bath pre-heated to the required
temperature, and the solution was stirred for the prescribed
time. The reaction was then quenched by addition of an excess
of glacial acetic acid (0.2 mL) into the solution, and the resul-
tant solution was then poured into methanol (200 mL). The
resultant polymer was then collected on filter paper and dried
in vacuo.
Crystal structure determinations
Crystallographic data for all structures is summarized in
Table 6 and the ESI,† and full details are provided in the de-
posited cifs. Diﬀraction data for all structures was collected
using Cu-Kα radiation except 8·14MeCN and 12·C6H14 for
which Mo-Kα radiation was used. A rotating anode X-ray
source and Hypix 6000 detector Rigaku AFC11 diﬀractometer
were employed in all cases.27 Data were corrected for Lp eﬀects
and for absorption.28 The structures were solved by a dual-
space, charge flipping algorithm and refined by full matrix
least-squares on F2 values.29,30 In common with most large
tBuCalix[n]arene metal structures, disorder was observed in
several tBu groups and the solvent of crystallisation. In each
case the disorder was modelled with restraints in geometrical
and anisotropic displacement parameters. When point atom
modelling was no longer possible due to severe disorder pro-
blems, the Platon Squeeze procedure was used to model the
aﬀected regions as diﬀuse areas of electron density.21a,b
Details of the specific disorder modelling employed for each
structure is given in the ESI.† CCDC 1973130–1973136,
1973364–1973366, and 2009076–2009077 contain the sup-
plementary crystallographic data for this paper.†
