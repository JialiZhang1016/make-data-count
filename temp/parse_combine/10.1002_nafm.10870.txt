Abstract
Objective: Silver Chub Macrhybopsis storeriana, a predominately riverine species 
throughout its native range, exists within Lake Erie as the only known lake popu-
lation. Its population declined in the 1950s and never fully recovered. Canada has 
listed Silver Chub in the Great Lakes–­St. Lawrence River as endangered and has 
initiated a recovery plan that recognized the identification of spawning areas as a 
critical component to inform Silver Chub's recovery potential.
Methods: We investigated potential spawning locations of Silver Chub using cap-
ture records, otolith microchemistry, and daily age analysis. Lapillus otolith Sr:Ca ra-
tios from 27 age-­0 Silver Chub were used to identify potential spawning areas. Daily 
ages estimated from lapilli were used to calculate hatch dates, which then were com-
pared with capture data of adults and river flows to further inform potential spawn-
ing areas.
Result: The Detroit River (and its nearshore area) was all but ruled out as a potential 
spawning location. The Maumee, Portage, and Sandusky rivers or their nearshore 
areas were all possible spawning locations. Projected hatch dates spanned the end 
of May through the end of June and occurred across a wide range of flows, although 
some peaks in hatch dates corresponded to flow peaks, indicating recruitment is po-
tentially enhanced by high flows.
Conclusion: Silver Chub spawning period and hypothesized spawning rivers or 
lacustuaries overlap those of invasive Grass Carp Ctenopharyngodon idella, creat-
ing a need to jointly consider Grass Carp control efforts with conservation of Silver 
Chub when assessing management alternatives. Further research on spawning 
guild and the use of rivers themselves or nearshore areas influenced by rivers as 
spawning areas are required to maximize potential for conservation and recovery 
of Silver Chub.

SILVER CHUB SPAWNING IN LAKE ERIE
INTRODUCTION
Silver Chub Macrhybopsis storeriana is a native leu-
ciscid of the large rivers of central North America. Its 
primary range is the Mississippi River and its large trib-
utaries (Gilbert  1978). Riverine populations outside of 
the Mississippi River basin include the Brazos, Mobile, 
Pascagoula, and Pearl rivers, which flow into the Gulf of 
Mexico; the Red River of the northern USA, which forms the 
border between the states of Minnesota and North Dakota; 
and the Assiniboine River of Manitoba (Gilbert  1978). 
Silver Chub populations have declined during the past 
several decades throughout most of their distributional 
range (e.g., Van Hassel et al. 1988; Hesse 1994; Berry and 
Young 2004; Haslouer et al. 2005; Perkin and Gido 2011; 
Steffenson et al. 2014). Increases in agricultural land use 
(Gammon and Gammon  1993), pollution (Krumholz 
and Minckley  1964), habitat fragmentation (Perkin and 
Gido 2011; Pierce et al. 2014; Perkin et al. 2015), and al-
tered flow regimens (Koel and Sparks 2002; Durham and 
Wilde 2006; Layzer and Scott 2006; Gido et al. 2010) have 
been identified as likely causal mechanisms in declines of 
Silver Chub and other riverine species. Although globally 
secure, Silver Chub populations are listed as vulnerable 
in the states of Arkansas, Kansas, Texas, West Virginia, 
and Wisconsin, imperiled in the states of Georgia, South 
Dakota, and Nebraska and the Canadian Province of 
Ontario, critically imperiled in Michigan, and presumed 
extirpated in New York (NatureServe 2013).
Although primarily riverine, a Silver Chub popula-
tion persists in Lake Erie. The dispersal pathway of Silver 
Chub into Lake Erie has not been rigorously investigated, 
but one possible pathway was when the outlet of glacial 
Lake Maumee flowed through what is now the Wabash 
River to the Mississippi River following the last glacial pe-
riod (Dryer 1919; Lewis et al. 1994; Mandrak and Cross-
man  1992; also see Elbassiouny et  al. 2023,  this special 
section). Silver Chub was abundant in Lake Erie from 
the late 1800s (McCormick 1892) through the mid-­1950s. 
Kinney (1954) reported capturing Silver Chub with bot-
tom trawls in several locations around the islands of west-
ern Lake Erie and near the mouth of the Portage River, 
including a few large samples in and near the mouth of 
Sandusky Bay in 1953 (Figure  1). He also reported an-
ecdotal evidence of a springtime fishery for Silver Chub 
along the shoreline east and northeast of the mouth of 
the Portage River. The population in Lake Erie declined in 
the mid-­1950s (Britt 1955) and remained low until the late 
1990s (USGS 2019a). There was a short-­lived population 
increase in the early 2000s (USGS 2019a), but there has 
never been a sustained recovery to the levels of the late 
1800s through 1950s.
The conservation status of Silver Chub in Lake Erie 
varies by jurisdiction. New York (NatureServe 2013; NYS-
DEC 2017) lists Silver Chub as endangered and probably 
extirpated. Michigan lists Silver Chub as critically imper-
iled (NatureServe  2013; Michigan Natural Features In-
ventory 2020). In Canada, Silver Chub in the Great Lakes 
and St. Lawrence River were identified by the Committee 
on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSE-
WIC 2012) as a separate designatable unit from those in 
the Nelson and Assiniboine rivers in Manitoba and Sas-
katchewan. The Great Lakes–­Upper St. Lawrence desig-
natable unit was changed in 2012 from of special concern 
to endangered. Canada has a recovery potential assess-
ment (McCulloch et  al.  2013) and a management plan 
(Boyko and Staton 2010). Ohio (ODNR 2017) and Penn-
sylvania (Pennsylvania Natural Heritage Program  2019) 
give Silver Chub no special status and do not recognize 
separate riverine and lake populations.
Canada's assessment of recovery potential (McCull-
och et al. 2013) identified several gaps in knowledge to 
be filled to inform recovery potential. Lack of knowledge 
of spawning areas was identified as a critical knowledge 
gap. Previous publications (e.g., Kinney 1954; Goodyear 
et al. 1982) indicate that Silver Chub spawned in the open 
lake or on beaches over clean gravel. However, these con-
clusions were based on timing of adult fish captures in 
the open lake (Kinney  1954) and assertions that Silver 
Chub spawned on beaches because “there are no suitable 
rivers remaining” (Goodyear et  al.  1982). Neither study 
provided data or analyses supporting where spawning 
occurred. Here, we use otolith microchemistry, daily age 
analysis, and capture records to identify potential spawn-
ing locations. Otolith microchemistry, especially in the 
core region, has been used to identify spawning locations 
for numerous species, especially when water chemistry

Impact statement
Conserving the Silver Chub is vital; it's an indi-
cator of water quality, a food source for aquatic 
organisms, and preserves biodiversity. Identifying 
both locations and mode of spawning enhances 
the conservation of biodiversity in fish communi-
ties, ensuring ecosystem stability.

differs among spawning locations because of the linear re-
lationship between water and otolith chemistry (e.g., Pan-
gle et al. 2010). In western Lake Erie, this is enhanced by 
the strong gradients of Sr:Ca that are very high in the San-
dusky and Portage rivers, moderate in the Maumee River, 
and very low in the Detroit River. Daily age analyses of 
larval and early juvenile fish can also be used to determine 
the timing of spawning and relate this to associated envi-
ronmental factors (Long and Grabowski 2017).
METHODS
Silver Chub were obtained for otolith microchemistry and 
daily age analyses in 2017 and 2018 from three sources: 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) comprehensive 
Aquatic Invasive Species Early Detection and Monitor-
ing Program conducted in Maumee Bay and Sandusky 
Bay, Ohio Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and 
Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry part-
nership Western Basin interagency August trawl survey, 
and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) June and September 
forage fish index surveys (USGS 2019a). The USFWS ef-
forts were conducted during spring to fall in Sandusky 
Bay and Maumee Bay, including the mouth of the Mau-
mee River. The USFWS samples were from daytime 
bottom trawl tows at depths >2 m, overnight sets from 
paired fyke nets at depths of 1–­2 m, and nighttime paired 
ichthyoplankton nets fished at depths >1 m. Ohio DNR 
samples were from bottom trawl samples collected May 
through September in Ohio waters of western Lake Erie. 
Samples from the USGS were from bottom trawl samples 
collected in June and September in Ohio and Ontario 
waters of western Lake Erie. Both Ohio DNR and USGS 
samples were from open waters of western Lake Erie at 
depths of 3–­11 m. All sampling and handling of fish dur-
ing research was done in accordance with guidelines pro-
vided by the American Fisheries Society's Use of Fishes in 
Research Committee (2014).
Silver Chub specimens were either stored in 95% non-
denatured ethanol or frozen in the field prior to otolith 
extraction. In the laboratory, lapilli were extracted and 
dried to remove any remaining tissue and placed dry 
into labeled vials. For young-­of-­year (age-­0) specimens, 
one lapillus was used for microchemistry analysis and 
the other to estimate daily age. For the microchemistry 
analysis, lapilli were embedded in a two-­part epoxy (West 
System 105 Epoxy Resin and 206 Slow Hardener). The 
otolith was then transversely sectioned using a low-­speed 
diamond-­tipped saw (South Bay Technology, Model 650). 
Both sides of the otoliths were wet polished with 3 M sil-
icon carbide sandpaper (400 and 600 grit) until the core 
was reached (typically to a thickness of ~200 μm) then 
buffed using Precision Surface International lapping film 
(12 μm, 3 μm). The polished otoliths were mounted on 
standard petroscopic microscope slides (~16 otoliths per 
FIGURE 1  Capture locations of Silver Chub in western Lake Erie in 2017 and 2018. The red line indicates the international border 
between Canada and the USA.

slide) using cyanoacrylate adhesive (Loctite Super Glue). 
The otolith slides were triple-­rinsed with Milli-­Q (Milli-
pore) ultrapure water and sonicated for 5 min in Milli-­Q 
water. The slides were covered and allowed to dry over-
night under a fume hood. The slides were stored in clean 
Petri dishes until the analysis was performed. All oto-
lith preparation was conducted at Bowling Green State 
University.
The otoliths were analyzed at the Great Lakes Insti-
tute for Environmental Research (University of Windsor, 
Ontario) using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma 
mass spectrometry (LA-­ICPMS) with an Agilent 7900 fast-­
switching quadrupole mass spectrometer coupled with a 
PhotonMachines 193-­nm laser. The laser was operated at a 
100-­Hz pulse rate, producing 0.059 mJ/pulse at the sample 
surface and a resulting laser ablation crater width of ~25 μm. 
The LA-­ICPMS was operated in low-­resolution peak-­
jumping mode (isotope dwell time: 10 ms, carrier gas: Ar), 
so that each element was measured every 250 ms. All laser 
traverses were run from the otolith edge through the core 
region to the opposite edge at a scan speed of 5 μm/s, mon-
itoring for 43Ca, 44Ca, 86Sr, and 88Sr. The 120Sn was mon-
itored to establish when ablation of the otolith had begun 
and ended as the epoxy contains a trace amount of tin. The 
concentrations of all elements were above background and 
always greater than the limits of detection. The theoretical 
concentration of calcium in stoichiometric calcium car-
bonate (400,432 μg Ca/g CaCO3) was used as an internal 
standard to correct for ablation yield differences between 
external calibration standard and the otoliths. A collection 
of background counts was taken for 60 s prior to analysis of 
each sample. Analysis of a certified standard reference glass 
(NIST 610) was conducted both before and after each set of 
16 otoliths was analyzed to calibrate concentrations and cor-
rect for ablation yield and instrument drift. Data processing 
was performed in R using elementR 1.3.7 (Sirot et al. 2017; 
R Core Team 2021), an R package for reducing elemental 
data from LA-­ICPMS. Images of postablation otoliths and 
graphs of Sr:Ca ratios versus unit time were used to identify 
location of the otolith core for assessing Sr:Ca ratio.
Although studies attempting to determine spawning 
areas of fishes frequently use ratios of other divalent cat-
ions to Ca (e.g., Whitledge et al. 2019), Sr:Ca ratios are 
particularly useful for assessing potential spawning loca-
tions in western Lake Erie because of highly distinguish-
able levels of Sr among the Detroit, Maumee, Portage, and 
Sandusky rivers. Aquifers supply water enriched in Sr to 
the Maumee, Portage, and Sandusky rivers, resulting in 
Sr levels inversely related to flow. During low flows, Sr:Ca 
levels are high, and they decrease as surface runoff de-
creases the proportion of groundwater in streamflow (i.e., 
during high-­flow events). Comparatively constant flow 
results in little fluctuation in Sr:Ca levels in the Detroit 
River. The Portage and Sandusky rivers have high Sr:Ca 
ratios, the Maumee has moderate Sr:Ca ratios, and the 
Detroit River has low Sr:Ca ratios (Alexander et al. 1998; 
Hayden 2009; Ohio EPA 2010; Pangle et al. 2010; Kočovský 
and Farver 2019). Because the Detroit River supplies over 
90% of the water to western Lake Erie, its influence dom-
inates most of western Lake Erie and Sr:Ca levels in west-
ern Lake Erie are only slightly higher than those in the 
Detroit River. Discharge from the Maumee, Portage, and 
Sandusky rivers influence Sr:Ca values within a few kilo-
meters of the southern shore, resulting in elevated Sr:Ca 
levels compared with offshore waters of western Lake Erie 
(Hayden 2009; Pangle et al. 2010).
Daily ages of age-­0 Silver Chub were estimated from 
counts of rings in lapilli. We used USGS September trawl-
ing data from 2005 to 2018 to create a histogram to assist 
in the identification of age-­0 Silver Chub (USGS 2019a; 
Figure 2). Lapilli were mounted to glass slides with ther-
moplastic cement and sanded to the core with 2000-­grit 
sandpaper to expose daily rings (Starks et al. 2016; Long 
and Grabowski 2017). To improve clarity, sanded otoliths 
were polished with 0.3-­μm alumina powder and a polish-
ing cloth prior to viewing. To estimate daily age, counts of 
rings in otoliths were made under 100–­200 magnification 
three times by one biologist with more than two decades 
of experience analyzing daily rings in otoliths (DiCenzo 
and Bettoli 1995; Starks et al. 2016; Long and Porta 2019). 
For each round of counts, lapilli were viewed in random 
order and without knowledge of fish length. For each oto-
lith, we calculated the mean ring count and all pairwise 
differences. We used the average (rounded up) of the two 
ring counts that were closest to each other and within 10% 
of the mean count as the estimated age (Neilson 1992). 
If all pairwise differences were greater than 10% of the 
mean ring count, we estimated ring count a fourth time 
and calculated the new pairwise differences. If there were 
no pairs within 10% of the mean ring count after a fourth 
count, we eliminated the otolith from further analyses.
Because all other known Silver Chub populations are 
riverine spawners and high flows have been linked to 
spawning success of some Macrhybopsis spp. (e.g., Starks 
et al. 2016), we compared hatch dates to flow conditions 
in potential candidate rivers for spawning based on mi-
crochemistry signatures in identified potential natal wa-
ters (see Results) to qualitatively assess flow conditions on 
fertilization dates to assist in potential hypothesis devel-
opment for when and under which hydraulic conditions 
spawning occurs. To estimate hatch dates, we subtracted 
the estimated age in days plus 1 day from the collection 
date (Starks et  al.  2016) following Bottrell et  al.  (1964) 
and Secor et al. (1992), who reported that two pairs of oto-
liths (probably lapilli and sagittae) were present 24 h after 
hatching in congeneric Peppered Chub M. tetranema. Not

McKENNA ET AL.
all young of year collected were used in both age and mi-
crochemistry analyses because we were not able to extract 
both lapilli from all young of year. When only one otolith 
was available, we randomly assigned the fish to have either 
microchemistry or daily age analysis. We overlaid histo-
grams of hatch dates with plots of discharge from USGS 
gauges 04193500 on the Maumee River, 04195500 on the 
Portage River, and 04198000 on the Sandusky River (water​
watch.usgs.gov) for age-­0 Silver Chub collected in 2018 to 
qualitatively examine potential relationships between dis-
charge and spawning. We did not make this comparison for 
2017 young of year because of small sample size (n = 5).
Statistical analysis
We used a threshold analysis for interpreting potential 
spawning locations based on outcomes of the otolith mi-
crochemisty analysis on 27 age-­0 Silver Chub. For the 
hatch date of each young of year, we retrieved mean daily 
flow data from the USGS streamflow gauges mentioned 
previously for the Maumee, Sandusky, and Portage rivers 
and estimated water Sr:Ca on hatch date using the follow-
ing equations:
Maumee: log(water Sr:Ca) = −0.2388·log(Qcms) + 1.1422  
(Alexander et al. 1998),
Portage: log(water Sr:Ca) = −0.1533·log(Qcms) + 1.1212 
(Kočovský and Farver 2019),
Sandusky: log(water Sr:Ca) = −0.3346·log(Qcms) + 1.4239  
(Alexander et al. 1998),
where Qcms is river discharge measured in cubic meters 
per second (cms). Because the flow of the Detroit River 
is much less variable, we did not use a regression equa-
tion and instead used the maximum value for the Detroit 
River from Kočovský and Farver (2019). We then divided 
otolith core microchemistry by a partition coefficient of 
0.43 (Table A.1 in the Appendix) to estimate water Sr:Ca 
on the hatch date. For example, for an otolith with a core 
Sr:Ca of 4.0, we estimated water Sr:Ca as 4.0/0.43 = 9.3. 
The final step in assessing potential for spawning in a 
tributary or the nearshore area influenced by it was to 
compare the otolith core Sr:Ca adjusted for flow to the ex-
pected river Sr:Ca on the hatch date. If the adjusted otolith 
Sr:Ca was higher than that of the water for a river, it was 
excluded as a possibility. This also applies to nearshore 
areas influenced by a river, which would necessarily be 
lower than that of the river itself (Hayden 2009).
RESULTS
Age-­0 Silver Chub were captured throughout western 
Lake Erie in 2017 and 2018 (Figure 1). Thirty-­six Silver 
Chub were collected in trawl samples by the USFWS in 
late May and early June 2017 in the lower reaches of 
the Maumee River and within approximately 3 km of its 
mouth. Young-­of-­year Silver Chub were captured at six 
locations near the mouth of the Maumee River, in off-
shore waters of western Lake Erie, and near Sandusky 
Bay. Two larval Silver Chub genetically confirmed by 
the USFWS Whitney Genetics Laboratory were col-
lected in ichthyoplankton nets, one on May 23, 2017, in 
Maumee Bay, approximately 5 km east of the mouth of 
the Maumee River and ~1 km north of shore, the other 
on July 7, 2017, approximately 7 km northeast of the 
mouth of the Maumee River in the open waters of west-
ern Lake Erie.
Core Sr:Ca values for all but one Silver Chub were too 
high for the otolith to have been influenced by Detroit 
River water (Table 1). Core Sr:Ca ratios were also too high 
for the open lake, which has lower values than the tribu-
taries and their nearshore areas. Ten fish had values too 
high to have been influenced by Maumee River water. The 
Sandusky River was eliminated as a possibility for only 
three fish, and the Portage River was not eliminated for 
any. Based on less difference between predicted Maumee 
River water Sr:Ca and core Sr:Ca values compared with 
differences between otoliths and either Portage or San-
dusky river water, we infer most spawning was likely asso-
ciated with the Maumee River.
We estimated daily ages for 48 age-­0 Silver Chub, 5 from 
2017 and 43 from 2018. Otoliths were not recovered from 
the two larvae captured in 2017. Daily ages ranged from 44 
to 84 days, with estimated hatch dates between June 18 and 
July 3 in 2017 and between May 27 and June 25 in 2018 
(Long and Kocovsky 2022). The average difference between 
mean estimated age and each of the two ring counts that 
contributed to the mean was 1.08 d (SD = 0.9) for the 2018 
young of year. We estimated the larvae captured on May 23

McKENNA ET AL.
(5.4 mm TL) and July 7 (6.1 mm TL), 2017, were no more 
than 1 day old at capture owing to lack of otoliths; hence, 
their hatch dates were May 22 or 23 and July 6 or 7.
Based on results of the microchemistry analysis, we 
overlaid a histogram of hatch dates for fish for which 
the Maumee, Portage, and Sandusky rivers were poten-
tial spawning associations (i.e., were not eliminated) on 
graphs of discharge for each river. Hatching occurred 
across a range of flows (Figure 3). Estimated hatch dates 
corresponded with the ascending limb or peak of one 
high-­flow event on each river, but estimated hatch dates 
also corresponded with lower flows.
DISCUSSION
Our analyses identified the Maumee River and the Por-
tage and Sandusky rivers or their associated nearshore 
areas as the most likely potential spawning areas for 
Silver Chub in western Lake Erie. Many of the otoliths 
we analyzed had core ratios of Sr:Ca, indicating the de-
veloping larvae or female parent during vitellogenesis 
(see below) were in the Maumee River, its mouth, or 
nearshore areas influenced by Maumee River water. Col-
lection of ripe females at the mouth of the Maumee River 
a few days prior to a larva being captured in Maumee Bay 
further corroborates the Maumee River, Maumee Bay, or 
nearshore areas influenced by Maumee River water as a 
possible spawning area. Evidence from other sampling 
efforts includes capture by the USFWS of a 49-­mm, age-­0 
Silver Chub in the Maumee River approximately 6 km 
from Maumee Bay in September 2019 and Ohio Environ-
mental Protection Agency records of a 44-­g Silver Chub 
captured during the spawning season 11 km upstream 
of the confluence with Maumee Bay (June 25, 2012; C. 
Boucher, Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, writ-
ten communication; The Ohio State University Museum 
of Biological Diversity specimen OSUMU 442227). Using 
length–­weight data from the USGS trawl data used to 
generate length histograms (USGS 2019a), this fish was

SILVER CHUB SPAWNING IN LAKE ERIE
159–­177 mm total length, which is likely a 2-­year-­old fish 
(i.e., spawning age).
Dual influences on chemical composition of otolith 
cores might complicate interpretation of our results. 
Otolith chemistry at the time of otolith formation is in-
fluenced by water mass chemistry during larval develop-
ment and potentially by the effect of water mass chemistry 
on yolks during vitellogenesis (Kalish 1990). This effect 
would likely be highest for species with large yolks and 
those that rely on those yolks for long periods of time, such 
as those in family Salmonidae (e.g., Kalish 1990). Species 
in the genus Macrhybopsis that have been studied absorb 
most of their yolks during their comparatively short de-
velopment, and the yolks are nearly completely absorbed 
at hatching (e.g., Bottrell et al. 1964). The effect of yolk 
chemistry on otolith chemistry for Macrhybopsis spp. is 
undoubtedly lower than that for Salmonidae but might 
not be negligible, allowing for Sr:Ca ratios to become 
more variable as larval fish drift and develop. For example, 
nearshore movement of Silver Chub into waters adjacent 
to Catawba Island in mid-­March, up to 3 months prior to 
spawning (Kinney 1954), includes the period prior to and 
during vitellogenesis. That area is near the outflow of the 
Portage River, which has very high Sr:Ca ratios compared 
with other tributaries. Our observation of Silver Chub 
congregating near the mouth of the Maumee River in 
May could be indirect evidence of spawning-­related near-
shore movement. Furthermore, residence in waters along 
the southern shore during vitellogenesis would result in 
yolks having higher Sr:Ca concentrations for fish in areas 
influenced by the Maumee, Portage, and Sandusky rivers, 
which cover the entire southern shoreline of western Lake 
Erie, compared with those that resided in open waters of 
western Lake Erie or near the mouth of the Detroit River. 
Therefore, it is possible that a fish resided in a water mass 
prior to spawning that was different from the water mass 
in which it spawned, meaning Sr:Ca from the resident 
water mass was incorporated into hard parts of developing 
fish, possibly complicating direct interpretation of the re-
sults. However, because yolks were not present in the two 
likely day-­old larval Silver Chub we captured in this study, 
contribution of Sr:Ca during the period of vitellogenesis 
(and thus in yolk) is probably not sufficient to hinder in-
terpretation of Sr:Ca representing natal areas.
For many fish, otolith core Sr:Ca ratios were so high 
that larvae or the female parent during vitellogenesis 
could only have been in the Sandusky or Portage rivers or 
nearshore areas with substantial amounts of water from 
the Sandusky or Portage rivers during periods of low flow. 
Kinney's  (1954) report of recreational anglers catching 
Silver Chub and Ohio DNR trawl records of Silver Chub 
being captured in nearshore areas along Catawba Island, 
which is in the Portage River plume east of the mouth 
of the Portage River (Figure 1), corroborate our findings 
that the Portage River, its mouth, or nearshore areas in-
fluenced by Portage River water could be spawning areas. 
Few Silver Chub age 1 and older have been captured in 
Sandusky Bay. Furthermore, no Silver Chub eggs or larvae 
have been reported from the Sandusky River or Sandusky 
Bay despite having been sampled intensively in 2015–­
2020 for early life history stages of Grass Carp as part of 
a long-­term assessment of spawning potential (Kočovský 
et al. 2018). These results cast doubt on the Sandusky River 
as a spawning area for Silver Chub, but they do not rule 
out Sandusky Bay or nearshore waters affected by its flow, 
especially if Silver Chub is not a pelagophil (see below).
Our analyses do not completely rule out the Detroit 
River or its mouth as a potential spawning area, but the 
evidence for it not being a spawning area is conflicting. 
Trawl samples near the mouth of the Detroit River in 
mid-­June sometimes include large numbers of adult Sil-
ver Chub, while samples at the same sites in September 
produce few or no Silver Chub (USGS 2019a), suggesting 
a spawning migration consistent with what we observed 
at the mouth of the Maumee River and Kinney's (1954) 
observation of nearshore movement in the months that 
precede spawning. Furthermore, the USFWS captured 
eight Silver Chub in the Detroit River with bottom trawls 
in August 2019 near the south end of Fighting Island (A. 
Bowen, USFWS, personal observation). The potential in-
fluence of resident water mass on core otolith microchem-
istry during vitellogenesis leaves open the possibility the 
female parent could have resided in water of higher Sr:Ca 
during vitellogenesis (southern shore, Portage or Mau-
mee rivers or plumes, Sandusky River or Sandusky Bay) 
and moved into Detroit River waters only to spawn as op-
posed to migrating there earlier in the spring as has been 
reported for Silver Chub along the southern shore. How-
ever, only one of the 27 fish we analyzed had low enough 
Sr:Ca in the otolith core to have possibly spent time in the 
Detroit River as a larvae. Moreover, no Silver Chub eggs or 
larvae have been reported in the literature in the Detroit 
River (Pritt et al. 2014; Tucker et al. 2018). The weight of 
evidence seems to nearly rule out the Detroit River or its 
mouth as a successful potential spawning area.
Our interpretations of potential spawning areas from 
otolith microchemistry relied on accurate partition coef-
ficients. Here, we used an average partition coefficient of 
0.43 calculated from freshwater species because we did 
not have a partition coefficient for Silver Chub. A higher 
partition coefficient for Silver Chub would mean that 
water Sr:Ca predicted from otolith chemistry would be 
lower than we estimated (Table 1). However, we would 
still predict that little successful reproduction occurs in 
the mouth of the Detroit River. A few of the Silver Chub 
we associated with the Maumee River or its nearshore

McKENNA ET AL.
areas may have had high enough otolith core Sr:Ca that 
they could have originated from the Portage and Sandusky 
rivers if the true partition coefficient from water to otolith 
was lower than 0.43. A laboratory study would be required 
to establish a species-­specific partition coefficient for Sil-
ver Chub.
As a riverine species in a lake environment, the ques-
tion of where Silver Chub spawn in the Lake Erie basin 
is not only of interest to recovery and persistence of the 
Lake Erie population, but is potentially of evolutionary 
significance. Evidence to date leaves open the question of 
Silver Chub spawning guild, which also complicates our 
interpretation of spawning areas. Balon (1975) classified 
Silver Chub as a phytolithophil, but Simon (1999) argued 
Silver Chub cannot be a phytolithophil because the lar-
vae lack cement glands and suggested the proper guild is 
lithopelagophil. Silver Chub spawning over clean gravel 
as reported, without supporting evidence, by Goodyear 
et al. (1982) would be consistent with Silver Chub being 
phytolithophils or lithopelagophils. However, several 
Macrhybopsis spp. that have been investigated have se-
mibuoyant, nonadhesive eggs (e.g., Speckled Chub M. aes-
tivalis [Bottrell et al. 1964; Platania and Altenbach 1998]; 
Sturgeon Chub M. gelida and Sicklefin Chub M. meeki 
[Albers and Wildhaber 2017]) and pelagic larvae (Speck-
led Chub, Sturgeon Chub, Sicklefin Chub, Silver Chub; 
Reeves and Galat 2010). Larson et al. (2016) and Cama-
cho et al. (2019) reported that genetically confirmed Silver 
Chub eggs were collected in surface ichthyoplankton nets 
in the upper Mississippi River basin, indicating eggs might 
be semibuoyant, which would mean Silver Chub are pela-
gophils. Furthermore, Perkin et al. (2023, this special sec-
tion) reported greater Silver Chub recruitment in longer 
pools of the Ohio River, which is consistent with the spe-
cies being a pelagophil (i.e., longer drift potential leading 
to greater hatching success). In Lake Erie, the only two 
confirmed Silver Chub larvae were collected in western 
Lake Erie in ichthyoplankton nets deployed near the sur-
face. These observations indicate that Silver Chub larvae 
are pelagic, which is typical for species in the pelagophil 
and lithopelagophil spawning guilds.
Another consideration for interpretation of spawning 
areas is the potential for Silver Chub in Lake Erie to have 
evolved a different spawning mode than riverine popula-
tions. The 14,000-­ to 11,000-­year separation of Silver Chub 
in Lake Erie from the riverine progenitor (Mandrak and 
Crossman  1992) has resulted in their becoming genet-
ically distinct from populations in the Assiniboine, Mis-
sissippi, Missouri, Ohio, and Wabash rivers (Elbassiouny 
et al. 2023 this issue). It is possible the novel evolutionary 
pressures of the lake environment that resulted in genetic 
differentiation also drove an evolution of spawning mode. 
A laboratory study analogous to those conducted by Al-
bers and Wildhaber (2017) would be required to settle the 
question of Silver Chub spawning guild.
Another gap in understanding is whether Silver 
Chub recruitment is higher when river flows are higher. 
Durham and Wilde (2006) found that some pelagophil 
species (i.e., Arkansas River Shiner Notropis girardi, 
Plains Minnow Hybognathus placitus, and Flathead 
Chub Platygobio gracilis) had the highest reproductive 
success during early spring when water discharge was 
consistently at its highest level. After accounting for a 
1-­day error in age estimates based on the standard devi-
ation from our 2018 young of year, peaks in hatch dates 
still align with high-­flow events. Although our results 
show that hatch dates were across a wide range of flows, 
indicating that spawning is not triggered by a high-­flow 
event, peaks in hatching were sometimes aligned with 
high-­flow events (Figure 3), suggesting a possible link 
between hatching success and high flows.
Viewed across years, densities of age-­1-­and-­older 
Silver Chub in USGS trawl samples in autumn 2019 
further support a possible influence of river flow on re-
cruitment. In 2017 and 2018, there were several high-­
flow events on the Maumee River (water​watch.usgs.gov, 
gauge 04193500). Spawning by Grass Carp, a pelagophil 
known to spawn during high-­flow events (Shireman 
and Smith 1983; Embke et al. 2016), was documented 
during several of those events (Kočovský et  al.  2018), 
including June 12–­13, 2018, when Silver Chub hatch 
dates peaked (Figure  3). Furthermore, Grass Carp re-
cruitment from the Maumee River on those dates was 
demonstrated by capture of larvae (USGS 2019b). Den-
sities of age-­1-­and-­older Silver Chub in USGS trawl 
samples (USGS 2019a) in autumn 2019 (i.e., 1-­year-­olds 
from 2018 and 2-­year-­olds from 2017) was 187 fish/ha, 
more than an order of magnitude higher than in 2017 
(15.6 fish/ha) and 2018 (16.6 fish/ha). In 2013 and 2014, 
there were fewer and lower-­magnitude flow events on 
the Maumee River, and density of age-­1-­and-­older Silver 
Chub in USGS trawl samples in autumn 2015 (i.e., age 
2 from 2013 and age 1 from 2014) was only 4 fish/ha 
(USGS  2019a). Successful recruitment related to high-­
flow events is characteristic of pelagophils and believed 
to be necessary to their persistence (e.g., Perkin and 
Gido 2011). These observational data indicate a poten-
tial link between high flows on the Maumee River and 
recruitment success of Silver Chub.
The Silver Chub population in Lake Erie represents 
a rare and unique element of biodiversity. It is the only 
known extant self-­sustaining population in a large 
lake. Canadian collection data include a few specimens 
from Lake Huron and Lake St. Clair during 1982–­1991

SILVER CHUB SPAWNING IN LAKE ERIE
(McCulloch et al. 2013) and a single specimen from Lake 
St. Clair in 2022 (M. Thorn, Ontario Ministry of Natural 
Resources and Forestry, written communication). One Sil-
ver Chub reported in the gut of a Lake Trout Salvelinus 
namaycush captured in Lake Huron during 2009–­2011 
(Roseman et al. 2014) was determined to have been a da-
tabase coding error upon our inquiry (E. Roseman, USGS, 
written communication). NatureServe lists Silver Chub as 
extirpated from Lake Michigan (NatureServe  2013), im-
plying they were once present, but neither Becker (1983) 
nor Greene (1935) included Silver Chub as present in 
Wisconsin waters of Lake Michigan. Stewart and Watkin-
son (2004) reported Silver Chub from Lake Winnipeg, but 
none have been reported since 2005 (D. Watkinson, Fish-
eries and Oceans Canada, written communication). Silver 
Chub has been reported in large reservoirs, such as Lake 
Texoma on the Red River (Gido et  al.  2002) and Lewis 
and Clark Reservoir on the Missouri River (Nelson and 
Walburg 1977; Kaemingk et al. 2007), but there are Sil-
ver Chub populations in both rivers; hence, the reservoir-­
dwelling Silver Chub might not be separate from the river 
populations.
Our research has helped identify potential spawning 
areas for Silver Chub, but our method did not allow us to 
definitively determine if spawning occurs in rivers. Con-
serving Silver Chub in Lake Erie is a priority in Canada, 
which lists Silver Chub in the Great Lakes as endangered 
(COSEWIC 2012) and has a recovery plan (Boyko and 
Staton  2010). Fish community objectives for Lake Erie 
include maintaining a native fish community, including 
rare, indigenous species (Francis et al. 2020).
A primary reason for the need to better understand 
Silver Chub spawning in rivers relates to efforts to man-
age invasive Grass Carp in Lake Erie. Grass Carp spawn 
in the Sandusky (Embke et al. 2016) and Maumee rivers 
(USGS  2019b) and potentially a third yet unidentified 
tributary (Whitledge et al. 2021), and their spawning sea-
son overlaps with that of Silver Chub. The current man-
agement plan for Grass Carp in the Sandusky River is to 
use a seasonal barrier (AECOM  2021) to prevent Grass 
Carp from reaching their spawning grounds (Kočovský 
et al. 2021). If Silver Chub spawn in the Sandusky River, 
any seasonal barrier that prevents Grass Carp spawning 
might also prevent Silver Chub spawning. We reiterate 
that presently there is only weak evidence of the possi-
bility of Silver Chub spawning in the Sandusky River. If 
Silver Chub use the Maumee River to spawn, which our 
analyses indicate is probable, any similar efforts there to 
interfere with Grass Carp spawning could adversely affect 
Silver Chub spawning. Definitive studies to determine 
spawning guild and use of rivers for spawning are the next 
steps to ensuring the long-­term persistence and recovery 
of Lake Erie Silver Chub.
