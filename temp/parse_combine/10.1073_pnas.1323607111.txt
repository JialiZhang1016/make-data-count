The development of organisms is changing drastically because of
anthropogenic changes in once-limited nutrients. Although the
importance of changing macronutrients, such as nitrogen and
phosphorus, is well-established, it is less clear how anthropogenic
changes in micronutrients will affect organismal development,
potentially changing dynamics of selection. We use butterflies as a
study system to test whether changes in sodium availability due to
road salt runoff have significant effects on the development of
sodium-limited traits, such as neural and muscle tissue. We first
document how road salt runoff can elevate sodium concentrations
in the tissue of some plant groups by 1.5–30 times. Using monarch
butterflies reared on roadside- and prairie-collected milkweed, we
then show that road salt runoff can result in increased muscle
mass (in males) and neural investment (in females). Finally, we
use an artificial diet manipulation in cabbage white butterflies to
show that variation in sodium chloride per se positively affects
male flight muscle and female brain size. Variation in sodium
not only has different effects depending on sex, but also can have
opposing effects on the same tissue: across both species, males
increase investment in flight muscle with increasing sodium, whereas
females show the opposite pattern. Taken together, our results show
that anthropogenic changes in sodium availability can affect the de-
velopment of traits in roadside-feeding herbivores. This research sug-
gests that changing micronutrient availability could alter selection
on foraging behavior for some roadside-developing invertebrates.

ecological stoichiometry
T
he development of fitness-related traits is closely tied to
nutrition—from fecundity being influenced by protein avail-
ability (1, 2) to ornament coloration being linked to carotenoid
abundance (3, 4). However, humans are having a major impact on
the availability of many nutrients important in the development of
these traits. For instance, nitrogen and phosphorus availability has
increased dramatically because of fertilizer application (5, 6), with
drastic consequences for biomass and nutrient content of producers
and consumers (7–9). Although the effects of changing macro-
nutrients have been well-studied, the importance of human-induced
changes in micronutrients is less established. Are anthropogenic
changes in once-limited micronutrients enough to drive differences
in trait development, potentially altering selection dynamics?
This research focuses on changing availability of an important
micronutrient: sodium. Sodium is a key component of animal
development, important for the function of neural and muscle
tissue (10–12) and affecting the development of traits, such as
brain size (13–16). However, sodium availability is limited in
most ecosystems (17–19), which is thought to have led to the
evolution of sodium cravings (20, 21) and specific foraging be-
havior to acquire sodium (22–25). Humans are increasing so-
dium availability, particularly through the application of road salt
(26–29) but also, through agricultural activity (30). In the met-
ropolitan area of Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota, ∼300,000
tons of sodium chloride are applied to roads each winter (31).
Research on the ecological impact of road salt has mostly focused
on the negative effects of chloride entering waterways (32–34).
However, road salt application can also increase the availability
of dietary sodium for animals. A handful of studies suggest that
road salt application may affect sodium foraging in animals from
ants to moose (35, 36). We know little about whether local increases
in sodium along roadsides have significant effects on development
of fitness-related traits for species feeding along roadsides, thus
altering evolutionary dynamics in the anthropocene.
Butterflies are an excellent study system to test the consequences
of changing sodium availability. Sodium availability has been shown
to affect the development and activity of flight muscle in male
Lepidoptera (37–39). Many adult male Lepidoptera actively forage
for sodium through puddling, transferring much of this sodium to
females during mating (23, 40–43). In addition, host plants of many
butterfly species commonly grow along roadsides and would be af-
fected by roadside runoff. Butterfly larvae also have limited move-
ment (44, 45), such that the spatially restricted effects of salt runoff
are biologically relevant. This work starts by documenting the effects
of roadside salt runoff on sodium availability in common butterfly
host plants. Two rearing experiments—one using roadside-collected
and control host plants and the other using a controlled artificial diet
manipulation—show the importance of changing sodium avail-
ability on trait development. In particular, we focus on two fitness-
related traits—muscle and neural tissue—where sodium availability
has a shown importance in trait development and function.

Significance
Sodium is an essential micronutrient that is often limited in
animal diets. It is important in the development of neural tissue
and thought to have driven the evolution of specific foraging
behavior. Human activity is drastically altering patterns of so-
dium availability, particularly through road salt application, but
we know little about the consequences of such anthropogenic
change on the development and evolution of wild animals.
Here, we show that road salt runoff affects sodium concen-
trations of roadside plants, which in turn, have significant,
(sometimes positive)
effects on neural and muscular de-
velopment of herbivores. These results suggest that anthropo-
genic changes in sodium can have major consequences for both
behavioral development and selection on foraging behavior.

sodium concentrations in leaves relative to specimens collected
at control sites 100 m away. There were significant differences
between sites for the milkweed and the oak species but not the
grass or the mustard (Table 1). There were no significant differ-
ences in leaf nitrogen concentration between the sites (Table 1).
Sodium in control butterfly tissue. Sodium was the most concentrated
micronutrient measured in butterfly tissue relative to plant tis-
sue, being more limited in availability than potassium, calcium,
and phosphorus (Table 2). Pieris rapae reared on bok choy had,
on average, 5,096 ppm sodium in their tissue relative to 112 ppm
in wild-collected mustards (Table 2). Similarly, sodium bio-
accumulated in monarch tissue was, on average, six times more
concentrated than in control host plant tissue (Table 2). Element
concentration varied somewhat with tissue type (e.g., head or
abdomen) and sex (Tables S1–S3).
Experiment 1: Host Plant Diet Manipulation with Monarchs. Survival.
Survival rates of monarch caterpillars were significantly lower on
the roadside-collected leaves (40.5%) than the prairie-collected
leaves (58.2%; χ2 = 5.2, P = 0.02); sex ratio did not differ on the
two diet types (χ2 = 0.03, P = 0.85).
Eye and muscle investment. Because there were significant inter-
actions between sex and diet, we analyzed male and female
monarchs separately. There was a significant effect of diet on
thoracic muscle investment in males but not females (Fig. 1A and
Table 3). Males reared on roadside-collected milkweed had
greater thoracic protein investment than those reared on prairie-
collected milkweed; this pattern was reversed in females but was
not significant. There was a significant effect of diet on relative eye
size in females but not males (Fig. 1B and Table 3): females reared
on roadside milkweed had significantly larger eyes (controlling for
body size) than those reared on prairie-collected milkweed.
Tissue sodium. Monarchs reared on roadside-collected milkweed
contained significantly more sodium in their abdomens than
prairie-reared monarchs, regardless of sex [mean (SE): prairie-
reared = 129.7 ppm (89.7); roadside-reared = 636.6 ppm (82.5);
diet: F1,22 = 18.3, P = 0.0003; sex: F1,22 = 0.44, P = 0.5]. Con-
centrations of other elements are reported in Table S3.
Experiment 2: Artificial Diet Manipulation with Cabbage Whites.
Survival. Cabbage white butterfly survival was significantly lower
on the high-sodium artificial diet than the medium- or low-
sodium diet, although there was no survival difference between
the latter two diet types (high: 10.9%; medium: 34.3%; low:
41.7%; χ2
2,525 = 48.8, P < 0.0001; difference between medium
and low: χ2
1,351 = 2.05, P = 0.15). Because of the low survival on
the high-sodium diet, all subsequent analyses contrast the low
and medium diet types only. Development time was longer by
1 d on the medium-sodium diet relative to the low-sodium diet,
but this difference was only marginally significant (low: 36 d;
medium: 37.1 d; F1,131 = 3.23, P = 0.07 in a model controlling
for sex).
Neural and muscle investment. Because there were significant sex by
diet interactions, males and females were analyzed separately.
There was a significant effect of diet on thoracic protein for both
males and females, but the direction of that effect differed: males
on the medium-sodium diet had greater thoracic protein than
males on the low-sodium diet, whereas females on the low-sodium
diet had greater thoracic protein than females on the medium-
sodium diet (Fig. 2A and Table 4).
Females raised on the low-sodium diet had significantly smaller
total brain volume than those raised on the medium-sodium diet
in a model that included body size (Fig. 2B and Table 4). There
was no difference in brain size of males reared on the two diets
(Fig. 2B and Table 4).
Discussion
Road Salt Runoff Affects Sodium Nutrition in Diverse Ways. We
found that some species of plants—but not all—had higher leaf
sodium levels along roadsides than in nearby control sites. In two
of four species assayed (milkweed and oak), sodium concentra-
tion of roadside plants was significantly higher relative to plants
at least 100 m from the road (Table 1) (1.5–30 times greater
concentration). This effect on sodium concentration of roadside
leaves is likely conservative given that we were focused on an
area with sandy, rapid-leaching soil and a county road with only
moderate levels of traffic and salt application. We might see
more pronounced differences along interstates or in areas with
clay-rich soil. Sodium from road salt runoff did not seem to stress
the plants in this study, because nitrogen content in leaves did
not differ between sites.
There were no significant effects of road salt runoff on sodium
levels in the mustard and grass species that we measured. The
lack of a response in the mustard was particularly surprising,
because several existing laboratory studies have shown that salt
treatments significantly elevate sodium concentration in Brassica
leaf tissue (from 1.3 to 20 times) (Table S4). It is possible that
the lack of an effect is specific to the mustard species that we
measured, which tends to have lower sodium levels than other
mustards (Table S4) and is not a preferred host of Pieris but-
terflies (46, 47). The variation that we observed between plant
species in sodium bioaccumulation could stem from phylogenetic
variation in sodium physiology (48, 49). Alternatively, because
we did not wash collected leaves (as we were interested in what
a caterpillar would consume), it is also possible that differences
stem from variation in leaf stickiness. For instance, common
milkweed has pubescent leaves covered with many soft short
hairs (50), which could potentially trap salt precipitate. Re-
gardless, these results suggest that salt application will affect the
nutrition of at least some roadside herbivores, but more research
is needed to determine exactly how changing sodium translates
into nutritional differences for specific herbivores.

Changes in Sodium Affect Butterfly Muscle and Neural Development.
Sodium was the most limited micronutrient in the diet of but-
terflies relative to its concentration in butterfly tissue (Table 2
and Tables S1–S3). Increases in sodium availability from road
salt runoff affected the development of neural and muscle tissue
in butterflies. Monarchs reared on roadside-collected milkweed,
which had 16 times more sodium than control milkweed, de-
veloped greater flight muscle in males and greater relative eye
size in females (Fig. 1 and Table 3). We were interested in
whether trait differences were being driven specifically by vari-
ation in sodium. We used an artificial diet manipulation with
cabbage white butterflies to specifically measure the effects of
sodium, contrasting two diets where sodium was limited (with
respect to butterfly tissue) but fell within the range of variation in
host plant sodium values (Tables 1 and 2 and Table S4) (51).
Results of this artificial diet experiment paralleled the results
from the plant-rearing experiment: males in the enriched sodium
treatment invested significantly more in thoracic protein, and
females invested significantly more in neural tissue (Fig. 2 and
Table 4). These data are consistent with observations from both
vertebrates and invertebrates that sodium is a key micronutrient
for brain (14) and muscular development (38). Although our ma-
nipulations were unable to eliminate the importance of chloride,
other diet manipulations have determined the importance of so-
dium over chloride in driving insect foraging behavior (18, 52). In
addition, as a cation, sodium in road salt runoff is more likely than
chloride to be retained in negatively charged soils (33).
Somewhat unexpectedly, female butterflies reared on rela-
tively higher-sodium diets invested less in thoracic protein than
those reared on lower-sodium diets. Although this difference was
significant only for cabbage whites reared on artificial diet, the
same pattern was seen in monarchs reared on field-collected
plants (Figs. 1 and 2 and Tables 3 and 4). It is possible that this
sex-specific effect reflects differences between males and females
in what levels of sodium are stressful (see below). Alternatively,
it is possible that females are plastically altering dispersal strat-
egies depending on the quality of their larval diet, which has
been seen in other species of butterflies (53, 54). If females
reared on higher-sodium diets perceive these resources as higher
quality, it may pay to invest less in flight and dispersal and instead,
invest more in searching locally (55, 56). However, experiments
are needed to determine whether the pattern in females is adap-
tive or simply a stress response.
Although increasing sodium availability can assuage the need
for a limited micronutrient, it is also clear that increasing nutrients
beyond some level can be stressful. Rearing cabbage whites on a
high-sodium diet (6,000 ppm) resulted in significantly lower
survival than the medium- and low-sodium levels. Monarch
survival was also lower on roadside-collected milkweed, but it is
unclear whether that was because of differences in sodium or
some other factor (e.g., car exhaust contamination). Thus, it is
possible that more extreme road salt runoff (e.g., along inter-
states) could result in more negative impacts on herbivores
feeding alongside the road. Although caterpillars may sometimes
be able to move away from host plants with toxic sodium levels
and choose more nutritious host plants (57), their ability to
disperse and make adaptive diet choices is likely quite limited
(44, 45, 58, 59). Studies on the movement and food preferences
of caterpillars will be necessary to determine the extent to which
corridors of roadside plants with very high sodium levels may
negatively affect caterpillar survival.
Implications: Changes in Limited Nutrients and Selection on Foraging
Behavior. Taken together, these data suggest that anthropogenic
changes in nutrient availability may affect trait development in
some species. Our data suggest that increases in sodium from
road salt runoff have the potential to affect diverse species (e.g.,
both monarchs and cabbage whites), but the effects will depend
on whether salt runoff affects the diet of a given species. Even
within plant families, we see variation in the effects of salt on
plant sodium levels (Table 1 vs. Table S4).
Our results leave open the extent to which road salt runoff
affects the net fitness of roadside-feeding herbivores. Monarchs
reared on roadside milkweed had significantly more sodium in
their abdomen than those reared on control milkweed. Given the
importance of sodium in Lepidopteran mating (41–43) and egg
production (60), it is possible that the increased abdominal sodium
may directly translate into differences in fitness, such as sper-
matophore size or egg number (61). Although the levels of so-
dium that we measured in butterfly tissue were similar to those

reported in other studies (60), the results of these studies em-
phasize that sodium concentrations vary significantly in butterfly
tissue, and we do not fully understand the fitness consequences of
such variation (if any). Future experiments will have to determine
the net effects of sodium on fitness given that we also observed
a decline in survival with high dietary sodium.
If increased sodium does, indeed, impact fitness, it is possible
that anthropogenic changes in nutrient availability will change
selection on foraging behavior in animals. We already see evi-
dence of altered foraging behavior in some species—ants that
live closer to roads forage less actively for sodium than those
farther from the road (36), and moose also show some prefer-
ence for roadside ponds because of salt runoff (35). Given that
butterflies and moths can detect sodium concentration through
contact chemoreceptors (62, 63), it is possible that they are also
showing changes in foraging behavior. This observation raises
the question of whether a thirst for a micronutrient, such as
sodium, could lead to increased preference for roadside habitats.
This preference might come with other changes, such as in-
creased mortality because of car collisions [as seen in moose
(64)] and subsequent selection on flight patterns to avoid cars [as
seen in birds (65)]. Animals, including insects and humans, can
choose to feed on sodium to the point of toxicity (66, 67), sug-
gesting that roadside sodium runoff may function as an evolu-
tionary trap (68) or select for resistance to high-sodium levels (69,
70). However, consistent preferences for roadside plants with higher
sodium levels could potentially lead to decreases in adult puddling
behavior or even evolutionary changes in brain size (71).
Overall, this work adds to a growing body of research sug-
gesting that humans are changing the nutritional ecology of
species, which results in changes in competition and community
ecology, life history traits and population cycles, and selection on
foraging behavior. This work highlights that changes in micro-
nutrients may be just as important as changes in macronutrients,
such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, where the majority of
the research has been focused. Humans are changing the avail-
ability of other micronutrients other than sodium, and it is likely
that similar effects hold true for those micronutrients. For in-
stance, given that calcium affects the abundance and development
of birds, snails, and worms (72–74), anthropogenic changes in
calcium (75, 76) may be particularly relevant for these taxa. Our
results highlight the need for more comprehensive descriptions of
how nutrition is changing in the face of humans and the diverse
responses across traits and species to such changes.
Materials and Methods
Sodium in Roadside Plants. To determine how road salt runoff affects sodium
availability in plant tissue, we collected plant samples from Cedar Creek
Ecosystem Science Reserve, a 2,200-ha field site just north of Minneapolis and
St. Paul, Minnesota. We focused on four common roadside species that
represent four common host plant families of butterflies: a perennial grass
(Poaceae: Panicum oligosanthes), a mustard (Brassicaceae: Berteroa incana),
an oak (Fagaceae: Quercus ellipsoidalis), and a milkweed (Apocynaceae:
Asclepias syriaca). At least three samples of each species were taken from
roadside ditches (within 5 m of a county road), and at least three samples
were taken from open field sites (at least 100 m from the paved road). Plant
material was harvested on the same day about 6 wk into the growing season
of these plants (June 14, 2013). Leaf material was dried in a drying oven (at
60 °C), and at least 1 g was submitted for analysis to the University of
Minnesota Research Analytical Laboratory. Inductively coupled plasma atomic
emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), dry ash method, was used to determine
sodium concentration in leaves (77). Leaves were not washed before drying,
because we were interested in the nutrients that a caterpillar would con-
sume. Given that sodium can result in plant stress and lower nitrogen con-
centrations (78), a key macronutrient for herbivores (79, 80), we also assayed
total nitrogen in these samples using the Dumas method (81).
Butterfly Rearing. Experiment 1: Rearing on roadside-collected plants. We com-
pared monarchs (Nymphalidae: Danaus plexippus) reared on roadside- and
prairie-collected host plants [in this case, common milkweed (Apocynaceae:
A. syriaca)]. Monarchs were chosen, because milkweed is a common roadside
plant, and investment in sodium-rich muscle should be important for a mi-
gratory species like monarchs. In 2011, milkweed was collected from the same
locations as the plant measurements (see above). ICP-AES analysis of these
leaves found that the roadside-collected milkweed was 16 times richer in
sodium than prairie-collected milkweed (764 relative to 47.5 ppm) but that
nitrogen levels were comparable (3.24% relative to 3.13%). Monarch eggs
were obtained from mating cages of wild-derived monarchs that had been
reared in the laboratory for one generation. Monarchs were reared in the
laboratory (one or two per 15-oz cup) on a 14-h photoperiod at 24 °C. Field-
collected milkweed was refreshed every 1–2 d. Adults were frozen at emer-
gence and stored in sealed containers at −20 °C for additional analysis.
Experiment 2: Rearing on artificial diets. We used an artificial diet to vary the
concentration of dietary sodium while holding other nutrients constant. We
focused on cabbage white butterflies (Pieridae: Pieris rapae), because this
species is easy to rear in large numbers on an artificial diet (82, 83). We used

an existing diet recipe but varied the concentration of sodium chloride. We
used ICP-AES to test the concentration of sodium in a set of pilot diet
manipulations. Based on these values, we constructed NaCl diets that were
∼400, 3,000, and 6,000 ppm sodium. These levels were chosen based on
values from field and laboratory studies of sodium in Brassicaceae leaves,
which show concentrations ranging from 69 to 14,900 ppm (median = 2,800
ppm) (Table S4). To make the artificial diet, we first constructed a base
Wesson salt mix without NaCl. We based our salt mix on established mixes
but used less calcium, because this mix has more calcium than is needed by
insects (84, 85). The base salt mix (wt/wt) included 43% potassium phosphate
monobasic, 17% potassium chloride, 14% calcium carbonate, 11% tricalcium
phosphate, 13% magnesium sulfate, 1.5% ferric phosphate, and trace
amounts (<0.05%) of copper sulfate, manganese sulfate, potassium alumi-
num sulfate, potassium iodide, and sodium fluoride. Per 800 mL water, the
artificial diet was made with 60 g wheat germ, 15 g cabbage flour, 27 g
casein, 24 g sucrose, 6.44 g base salt mix, 12 g torula yeast, 3.6 g cholesterol,
10.5 g vitamin mix, 0.75 g methyl paraben, 1.5 g sorbic acid, 3 g ascorbic acid,
and 0.2 g streptomycin mixed with 15 g agar and 6 mL linseed oil. The low-,
medium-, and high-sodium diets were constructing by adding 0.42, 6.1, and
12.65 g NaCl, respectively, to the base diet ingredients.
Gravid female P. rapae were obtained from wild populations in Minnesota
and Virginia. Eggs were collected from females on cabbage plants in green-
house cages. Within 7–10 d of eggs being laid, larvae were transferred from
cabbage to one of three artificial diets (randomly assigned). Larvae were
reared in groups of three per 4-oz cup in climate chambers at 23 °C with
a 14-h photoperiod. On emergence, the head of each individual was fixed
for brain histology (see below). The rest of the butterfly was stored in sealed
containers at −20 °C until additional analysis. No significant differences were
seen between populations, and therefore, they were pooled for analyses. An
additional set of P. rapae from Minnesota populations was reared (three to
six per rearing cup) in the laboratory on a host plant (bok choy; changed
daily) to test levels of sodium in butterfly tissue reared on plants. Adult
butterfly tissue was analyzed using ICP-AES (three to four individuals per
sample to increase measurement accuracy).
Trait Measurements. Development time, survival, and body size. Development
time was measured as the number of days between the date that an egg was
laid and the date that the adult butterfly emerged. Survival was measured
across all individuals transferred from the original egg-laying substrate to
their respective diet manipulation. Body size was measured as forewing
length (from removed wings) from the articulation of the wing with the
thorax to the wing apex.
Muscle tissue. A Bradford assay was used to determine the amount of protein
in the thorax, which is primarily composed of flight muscle. Thoraxes of
individual butterflies were separated and dried in a drying oven (at 60 °C) for
at least 24 h. Individual thoraxes were weighed to the nearest 0.1 mg and
then processed using established methods (86). Briefly, 2% sodium sulfate
was added to the sample (800 μL for monarchs and 400 μL for Pieris), which
was then finely ground before a 2- or 1-μL aliquot was taken from each Pieris
and monarch sample, respectively. Samples (two technical replicates each)
were compared against eight BSA standards (average R2 of standard curve
= 0.974). We controlled for variation across batches and measurement error
by taking the least square mean for each individual in a model across all
replicate measurements that included batch as a fixed effect. An individual’s
thoracic protein was quantified as the total protein from the Bradford assay
divided by the dry mass of their thorax.
Neural investment—eye size and brain size. We used two methods to measure
neural investment. First, we used standard histological techniques to measure
the brain size of P. rapae reared on artificial diets (87) (n = 8 females and
n = 7 males). Briefly, heads were fixed in formalin, stained with 1% osmium
tetroxide, embedded in plastic, and sectioned using a carbide tungsten knife
at 15-μm thickness. Brains were imaged on a Leica DM 2500 microscope
using differential interference contrast and measured in ImageJ (National
Institutes of Health). Total brain volume was measured as neuropil from the
appearance of the antennal lobes (anterior) to the end of the medulla
(posterior). Second, given that brain processing is labor-intensive (5 h/in-
dividual) with high probability of sample loss because of damage, we used
eye size as a measure of neural investment for monarchs. About 75% of the
butterfly brain is dedicated to visual processing (88, 89), and relative eye size
is correlated with visual processing areas and brain size in vertebrates and
invertebrates (90–92). To measure eye size, we took frontal images of each
individual’s head (93) after orienting heads (with labial palps removed) in
a Styrofoam holder. Any individuals with eye damage were eliminated. Eye
width was measured for each eye. Measurement error (the absolute value
of the difference in width between each eye) was included in each model
to correct for alignment errors.
Sodium in butterfly tissue. We used ICP-AES to measure sodium in monarch
abdomens. We focused on monarch abdomens, because they were large
enough to accurately measure sodium in individual samples and given that
they contain reproductive tissues, are presumably relevant for fitness.
Analyses. We used JMP 9.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) for all statistical analyses.
ANOVA and t tests were used to test for effects of diet on focal traits. For
traits that were correlated with body size (e.g., eye size), we included body
size (wing length) in the model. Thoracic protein, leaf sodium, and eye align-
ment measures were log-transformed for normality.
