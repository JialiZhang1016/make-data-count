Abstract Spring heat accumulation plays a major role in the timing of events such as leaf‐out, leaf
expansion, ﬂowering, and insect hatch in temperate systems. Accordingly, heat accumulation can
serve as a proxy for the timing of plant and insect phenological activity and can be used in a
predictive way when the timing of heat accumulation thresholds being reached can be anticipated.
This has strong value for a host of planning and management applications. If relationships exist
between earlier‐ and later‐season thresholds at a location, then the timing of later‐season phenological
events that are forced by the accumulation of warmth could be anticipated based on when
earlier‐season thresholds are met. Using high‐resolution daily temperature data, we calculated the
coherence in pairs of spring‐season heat accumulation (growing degree day) threshold anomalies over
1948–2016. Overall, relationships between thresholds spanning the entire spring season were relatively
low, while later season thresholds exhibited much higher correlations. This pattern is generally the
result of decreasing variability in heat accumulation with season progression. However, correlation
strengths did not follow latitudinal or gradients, revealing that within‐season heat accumulation and
interannual variability in threshold timing are unique to the speciﬁed base temperature and thresholds
being compared. We show that the relationships between earlier‐ and later‐season heat accumulation
thresholds were sufﬁcient to accurately predict the timing of phenological events in plants in two
case examples.
Plain Language Summary In several recent years, spring has arrived especially early across
much of the United States. Warm temperatures occurred earlier than average, and consequently, many
trees and crops put on leaves or ﬂowered days or weeks ahead of normal. Whether an early start to
spring season weather conditions—and subsequently, plant and insect activity—leads to similarly early
initiation of later‐season events in plant and insect life cycles is not well understood. In some locations
in the United States, the timing of the arrival of warm spring temperatures is a strong predictor of
when biological events that occur in the middle and later part of spring would occur: an early start to
spring will mean that later events will continue to occur ahead of schedule. In many other locations,
the relationship is not as strong. These ﬁndings are important for scheduling management activities later
in the season. For example, insect pest managers might use information regarding whether warm
temperatures in the beginning or middle of spring are occurring ahead of schedule to plan whether crews
should be dispatched earlier than usual.
1. Introduction
Anomalously early spring warmth and phenological activity typically draws a great deal of attention; for
example, the particularly early spring in much of the United States in 2017 dominated news media for weeks.
Often, declarations of “early spring” are based on anomalously warm winter and spring temperatures,
resulting in earlier‐than‐normal activity among species and phenological events representing in the leading
edge of the spring season (Ault et al., 2013; Ellwood et al., 2013; Hufkens et al., 2012). Whether an early start
to spring season weather conditions—and subsequently, plant and animal activity—persists through the
spring season, leading to early onsets of biological events occurring later into the season, has been less
thoroughly evaluated.

In much of the Northern Hemisphere, spring heat accumulation plays a major role in the timing of events
such as leaf‐out, leaf expansion, ﬂowering, and insect hatch (Cook et al., 2012; Crimmins et al., 2017;
Schwartz et al., 2006; Vitasse et al., 2011). While other variables such as accumulated chill and
daylength clearly play a role in inﬂuencing the timing of phenological events, accumulated warmth can
often perform quite well at estimating spring‐season phenological activity in temperate systems
(Basler, 2016; Cook et al., 2012; Hufkens et al., 2018; Hunter & Lechowicz, 1992; Linkosalo et al., 2006).
The strong performance of accumulated heat as an indicator of the timing of spring‐season plant and insect
activity has been long accepted and well‐documented for many species (e.g., Arnold, 1959; Croft et al., 1976;
Cross & Zuber, 1972; Herms, 2004; Hoover, 1955; Laskin et al., 2019; Melaas et al., 2016; Perry et al., 1986;
Reáumur, 1735). Essentially, springtime physiological development commences once the average daily
temperature surpasses a base threshold unique to the species, after which development increases as a
function of local air temperature (Snyder et al., 1999). For many species, the speciﬁc amount of accumulated
heat above a lower temperature threshold that is required to trigger a life cycle event, such as leaf out or adult
emergence, has been quantiﬁed (e.g., Campbell et al., 1974; Herms, 2004; Murray, 2008, Cornell Cooperative
Extension, 2010).
Spring‐season heat accumulation does not happen at a constant rate: warmth accumulates rapidly
during warm spells and stalls out during cold periods. Applying the logic that heat accumulation can
serve as a proxy for the timing of plant and insect phenological activity, phenological events may happen
earlier or later than average in a particular year, based on the weather in a season and when various heat
accumulation thresholds are met at a location.
Within a season, heat accumulation can be consistently ahead or behind schedule, resulting in anomalies
for two thresholds (in terms of difference in days from average date of occurrence) exhibiting the same
sign—or exhibiting reverse signs—reﬂecting jumps and lags in heat accumulation based on weather
variability occurring prior to the threshold dates (Figure 1a). For example, in 2018, consistent signs in
anomalies were apparent between the USA National Phenology Network (USA‐NPN)'s Spring Leaf
and Bloom Indices, two heat‐driven, early‐season metrics (Ault et al., 2015; Schwartz et al., 2006), in
much of the Upper Midwestern United States (both indices reached later than average) and Southwest
(both indices reached earlier than average; Figures 1b and 1c). In contrast, anomaly direction and mag-
nitude between these two indices varied dramatically in the Southeast as well as in parts of the Central
Plains and the Paciﬁc Northwest in 2018.
If relationships exist between earlier‐ and later‐season thresholds at a location, then the timing of later‐
season phenological events that are forced by the accumulation of warmth could be anticipated based
on when earlier‐season thresholds are met. The ability to anticipate whether later‐season events are likely
to occur ahead or behind schedule based on early‐season temperature conditions can guide a host of planning
and management applications. For example, planning and scheduling activities related to the start and
duration of the allergy season, harvest dates, pest and pathogen detection, invasive species management,
and seasonal activities focused on biological events like peak bloom could all be enhanced with this form
of insight (Enquist et al., 2014). Demand for information and ecological forecasts at multiple time scales is
growing considerably among natural resource managers to guide planning and anticipate change
(Bradford et al., 2018; Dietze et al., 2018). This information could serve as a valuable complement to seasonal
and shorter‐term weather and phenology forecasts (Carillo et al., 2018; Kirtman et al., 2014; Mo &
Lettenmaier, 2014; Saha et al., 2014).
In this study, we explored whether the anomaly of earlier‐season heat accumulation thresholds propagated
to later‐season thresholds, and whether the consistency in these anomalies varied across geography in the
conterminous United States. We ask, if early‐season spring warmth arrives ahead of (or behind) schedule,
resulting in earlier‐than‐average (or later‐than‐average) phenological activity at the start of the season, will
later‐season heat‐driven events similarly occur earlier (or later) than normal? Further, do the strength of
these relationships vary across the conterminous United States?
In the northern hemisphere, the arrival of spring warmth progresses following latitude as Sun angle
increases (Stine et al., 2009). Further, weather, and therefore, temperature accumulation, is more variable
in the earliest months of the year and decreases as the spring and summer seasons progress due to changes
in atmospheric circulation (James & Arguez, 2015; McKinnon et al., 2016; Stine & Huybers, 2012).

Accordingly, we anticipate that comparisons of later‐season thresholds will exhibit stronger relationships
than comparisons involving earlier‐season thresholds. Additionally, we predict that within a comparison
of two thresholds, correlation strength will increase with increasing latitude and elevation due to
thresholds being met later in the year.

2. Materials and Methods
To evaluate intraseasonal relationships of the spring development period in plants and animals, we
examined three thresholds in spring‐season heat accumulation: 50, 250, and 450 growing degree days
(GDDs) calculated in Celsius, based on a 1 January start date and two commonly used base temperatures
0 °C and 10 °C (Herms, 2004; Tait, 2008; Yang et al., 1995). Both 0 °C and 10 °C are common base tempera-
tures in agriculture, turf management, and integrated pest management applications (Alessi & Power, 1971;
Cardina et al., 2011; Cross & Zuber, 1972; Herms, 2004; Roby & Matthews, 2004; Wolfe et al., 1989) as well as
phenological models (e.g., Heide, 1993; Raulier & Bernier, 2000; Ruml et al., 2010). These heat accumulation
thresholds encompass the initiation of spring‐season plant activity including budburst, leaf out, and ﬂower-
ing in the majority of plant species in the United States (Cornell Cooperative Extension, 2010; Herms, 2004;
Murray, 2008; University of California Statewide Integrated Pest Management Program, 2019), as these
events are generally strongly driven by temperature (Basler, 2016; Cook et al., 2012; Linkosalo et al., 2006;
Melaas et al., 2016; Polgar et al., 2014). When calculated using 10 °C base temperature, 50 GDD represents
the earliest‐season activities in plants (Herms, 2004); 50 GDD calculated on 0 °C reﬂects an even earlier point
in the spring season in temperate forest ecosystems. The 250‐GDD (10 °C base temperature) threshold
represents a very active point in the season, around which many plants are initiating spring activity, and
450 GDD (10 °C base temperature) represents a point several weeks later in the season, around which many
plant species are exhibiting ﬂowering activity (Herms, 2004; Murray, 2008; University of California
Statewide Integrated Pest Management Program, 2019).
We calculated cumulative GDDs for each grid cell in each year (1948–2016) using the TopoWx gridded
climatic dataset resampled from 800 m to nominal resolution of 3 km (Oyler et al., 2014). Daily total growing
degree days above 0 °C and 10 °C thresholds were calculated using the simple average method (McMaster &
Wilhelm, 1997). The day of year (DOY) that the 50‐, 250‐, and 450‐GDD thresholds were met were then
determined from the cumulative growing degree grids. Locations greater than 2,750 m failed to consistently
reach 450 GDDs with the 10 °C base temperature; these areas were masked from subsequent analysis.
To determine yearly anomalies for each of the thresholds and each base temperature, we calculated the
mean DOY each threshold was met over the climate normal period of 1981–2010 and then differenced this
DOY layer from each yearly threshold DOY layer.
We detrended each pixel anomaly time series to remove linear trends over the historical record that might
impact the intraseasonal correlations. Pairwise Pearson's r correlations were then calculated on the
detrended anomaly time series for each combination of GDD threshold and base temperature, resulting
in six sets of correlations: 50–250 GDD (“early season”), 250–450 GDD (“late season”), and 50–450 GDD
(“full season”), each for 0 °C and 10 °C base temperatures.
To demonstrate how these correlations could be used in a management context, we made predictions of
the timing of phenological events that typically occur around 450 GDD in individual years based on when
50‐‐ and 250‐GDD thresholds were reached at a single location. We used the detrended time for an individual
pixel to construct linear models of when 450 GDD DOY would be met based on when 50 or 250 GDD DOY
was met.
We used observational phenology data maintained by the USA‐NPN verify predictions of phenological
activity in two case studies. The phenology data maintained by the USA‐NPN are contributed by thousands
of volunteers across the United States through the phenology observing program, Nature's Notebook
(Rosemartin et al., 2014) and exhibit high accuracy and reliability (Fuccillo et al., 2015). We accessed
“individual phenometrics” data using the USA‐NPN's Phenology Observation Portal for species with
phenophases known to occur at approximately 450 GDD (10 °C base temperature), including staghorn
sumac (Rhus typhina) and wild strawberry (Fragaria virginiana; USA National Phenology Network, 2019).
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Intraseason Correlations Vary by Geography and Point in Season
Correlations between heat accumulation thresholds range from a minimum of 0.02 (50–450 GDD, 0 °C
base temperature) to a maximum of 0.98 (250–450 GDD, 10 °C base temperature; Figure 2) across the
conterminous United States; nearly all correlations are signiﬁcant. No negative correlations emerged,

indicating that there are no patterns where a negative anomaly for the ﬁrst threshold consistently leads to a
positive anomaly for the second threshold, and vice versa.
Correlation strengths are higher when later‐season thresholds are compared, supporting our ﬁrst
hypothesis. The strongest relationships occur between the late‐season thresholds (250 and 450 GDD;
Figures 2a and 2b). Relationships between early‐season (50 and 250 GDD; Figures 2c and 2d) as well as
full‐season (50 and 450 GDD; Figures 2e and 2f) thresholds are, overall, much weaker.
Patterns across geography and base temperatures are not as clear. Correlations between pairs of thresholds
exhibit similar values when calculated using the two different base temperatures; however, in contrast to
what we expected, the geographic patterns in the strength of the relationships vary and do not consistently
follow latitudinal or topographic gradients (Figures 2a, 2c, and 2e versus Figures 2b, 2d, and 2f). Further,
although correlations increase in strength when later‐season thresholds are compared (Figure 2), the spatial
pattern of the strength of the relationships is not held constant across multiple pairs of thresholds.
3.2. Threshold Timing and Variability Are Not Sufﬁcient to Explain Correlations
Individual thresholds exhibit unique patterns in their timing and variability with which they occur from year
to year. When combined, these variables underpin correlations between pairs of thresholds.
Following the established pattern that the arrival of spring warmth progresses with increasing latitude,
the DOY 50‐, 250‐, and 450‐GDD thresholds are met follow clear patterns: single thresholds are reached
at later DOYs with increasing latitude and elevation (Figure S1). Thresholds calculated on 10 °C base
temperature are reached weeks later than the same threshold calculated on 0 °C base temperature: the
450‐GDD (0 °C base temperature) DOY map is roughly equivalent to the 50‐GDD (10 °C base
temperature) DOY map.
Patterns in the interannual variability of the DOY thresholds are met are also apparent, but not as
straightforward. First, variability in threshold timing generally decreases as the season progresses:
thresholds that occur later in the year vary less in their timing from year to year than those that are reached
earlier in the year. This is true for both base temperatures, even though they occur weeks apart. The values

for the GDD450 variability in DOY (hereafter, SD (DOY)) maps (mean ± SD: 7.7 ± 1.5 [base 0 °C], 7.1 ± 1.4
[base 10 °C]) are generally much lower than those for the GDD50 SD (DOY) maps (11.1 ± 5.3 [base 0 °C],
11.1 ± 2.9 [base 10 °C]; Figure S1). Second, with the exception of southern latitudes, locations that reach
a threshold later in the year exhibit lower variability than locations that reach the same threshold earlier
in the year. Low latitudes can exhibit very low variability in locations where daily average temperatures
do not fall below the speciﬁed base temperature and heat accumulation therefore begins on the speciﬁed
start date (e.g., 1 January). Finally, base temperature results in different geographic patterns in variability
in threshold timing. Maps calculated on 0 °C base temperature show the largest variability at midlatitudes;
the regions exhibiting the greatest variability on 10 °C base temperatures are notably lower latitudes.
These factors characterize the interannual variability in heat accumulation patterns, but alone they do not
explain the geographic and temporal patterns in threshold correlation strengths observed in Figure 2.
Rather, the degree of consistency in threshold anomalies is governed by whether the timing of the second
threshold is advanced or delayed in concert with the ﬁrst threshold. This relationship is reﬂected in two
related factors: how much heat accumulation prior to the ﬁrst threshold being met varies from year to year
relative to how much the heat accumulation occurring between the thresholds varies from year to year.
Thresholds “hang together”—that is, both occur earlier or later than average—when the variability in the
duration between the two thresholds (SD (duration)) is less than the variability in the timing of the ﬁrst
threshold (SD(T1)). Under these conditions, the timing of the ﬁrst threshold may move around a great deal,
shifting by many days from one year to the next, and the second threshold occurs at a relatively predictable
span of time thereafter. As the variability in the two variables approach equal values, correlations decrease.
Greater SD (duration) relative to SD(T1) indicates that the anomaly direction of the second threshold does
not regularly match that of the ﬁrst threshold.
We present the relationship between these two variables as the ratio of SD (duration)/SD(T1), where a value
less than 1.0 reﬂects greater variability in the timing of the ﬁrst threshold, a value equal to 1.0 represents
similar variability in both metrics, and a value greater than 1.0 reﬂects greater variability in the duration
of time between the thresholds. This pattern holds true across geography. Generally, when correlations
are highest—and thresholds both occur either early or late—the values of this ratio are lowest (Figure 3).
In this analysis, geographic patterns in threshold variability ratio values (Figure 4) closely match geographic
patterns in the strength of correlations between thresholds (Figure 2).
To more clearly visualize the interplay between these two forms of variability and the concomitant correla-
tions in threshold anomalies, we present time series of annual threshold dates and anomalies for several loca-
tions reﬂecting a diversity of onset dates, strength of full‐season (50–450 GDD) correlations, and differences
in correlations between base temperatures (Figure 5). In this ﬁgure, the DOY 50 and 450 GDD are met is pro-
vided in each of the 69 years by the ﬁlled circles. The variability in the timing of the ﬁrst threshold, or SD(T1),
is reﬂected in leading (DOY 50 GDD) circles, and the variability in the duration between the two thresholds,
or (SD (duration)), is reﬂected in the length of the bars connecting the DOY 50‐ and 450‐GDD circles.
Location 3 (10 °C base temperature; Figure 5f) exhibits a pattern of greater SD(T1) for 50 GDD than SD
(duration)—seen as a large range of DOYs the 50‐GDD threshold was met and comparatively low year‐to‐
year difference in the duration of time between the thresholds being met. Accordingly, this location exhibits
a threshold variation ratio of 0.72 and a comparatively high correlation. In contrast, an example of nearly
equal variability in the two ratio variables (threshold variability ratio = 0.97) occurs at location 2 (10 °C base
temperature; Figure 5d), indicating nearly equivalent measures of variability in the rate of heat accumula-
tion prior to the ﬁrst threshold being met and that occurring between the thresholds. This location exhibits
a very low correlation, or weak ability to predict the timing of the second threshold based on the timing of
the ﬁrst threshold being met.
High threshold variation ratio values (≫1.0) occur at very high latitudes on the base 10 °C maps, where SD
(duration) is much greater than SD(T1). The comparatively very large variability in duration between the
thresholds is the result of a short growing season and the onset of cool temperatures prior to the second
threshold being met in some years, as in location 4 (10 °C base temperature; Figure 5h). At this location,
the DOY 50 GDD that is met is comparatively consistent from year to year, and the duration of time
between the thresholds being met is quite large. This phenomenon could also emerge at high latitudes with
abbreviated growing seasons, with different choices of base temperatures or thresholds.

3.3. Geographic Limitations to Correlations
Aside from locations at high latitudes and elevations with short growing seasons, threshold variation ratio
values greater than 1.0 at low latitudes indicate locations where temperature is not limiting, and correlation
values can be artiﬁcially low or misleading. In locations where daily average temperatures do not fall below
the speciﬁed base temperature, heat accumulation begins on the speciﬁed start date (e.g., 1 January).
This results in lower variation for early thresholds being met compared to locations where heat

accumulation naturally begins on a date subsequent to the speciﬁed start date (Figure S1). The restricted
range for the date of the ﬁrst threshold impacts the true variability that could occur prior to 1 January
possibly artiﬁcially reducing correlation values (Bland & Altman, 2011; Nie & Chu, 2011). Location 1
(Figure 5a; 0 °C base temperature) exhibits this phenomena. Variability in the DOY 50 GDD that is met at
this location is very low (0.98 days; Figure 4), clearly lower than that of the duration between the two
thresholds, and the result of daily average temperatures remaining above 0 °C year‐round.
The geographic extent of locations with restricted range is a function of the base temperature selected.
The 50–450‐GDD comparison calculated on 10 °C base temperature yielded restricted ranges in southern
Florida and Texas (Figure 4). Using a 0 °C base temperature for the same thresholds, the region impacted
by this phenomenon stretches into all southern states as well as California and Oregon (Figure 4).
3.4. Correlation Strength Is a Product of Base Temperature, Thresholds Being Compared, and
Within‐Season Timing
The clearest pattern in the interseasonal threshold correlations is that correlations between later‐season
thresholds are notably higher than earlier‐season thresholds (Figure 2). The greater coherence in later‐
season anomaly direction driving this relationship is explained by an overall decrease in heat accumulation
variability as the season progresses (Figure S1), resulting in a shift toward greater SD(T1) relative to SD
(duration). This shift is reﬂected in decreasing threshold variation ratio values (Figure 4).
Our second hypothesis—that correlations would increase with increasing latitude and elevation, as
individual thresholds are met at progressively later DOYs with increasing latitude and elevation—was not
supported; correlations do not show clear patterns following latitude or elevation (Figure 2). Following this
logic, we might expect higher correlations for thresholds calculated using higher base temperatures, as
thresholds calculated using higher base temperatures are reached later in the season (Figure S1). Again, this
pattern is not apparent: the strength of correlations between the same two thresholds calculated on two base
temperatures are very similar (Figure 2).
These ﬁndings underscore that the strength of the relationship between two heat accumulation thresholds at
a particular location is not simply the result of the point in the year at which they are being reached. Rather,
the consistency in threshold anomaly direction and magnitude, and therefore the ability to anticipate the
timing of a later‐season event based on earlier‐season conditions, is speciﬁc to the base temperature and
choice of thresholds under examination. The patterns in seasonal heat accumulation are unique to the
speciﬁed base temperature. Further, the speciﬁcations for base temperature and thresholds evaluated govern
the two forms of variability that indicate whether threshold anomalies are likely to consistently exhibit
similar directions. The unique patterns in heat accumulation driven by local variability in daily tempera-
tures between the thresholds do not follow predictable latitude or elevation patterns, even though the timing
that thresholds are reached and the variability in this timing progress along these gradients.
Though not evaluated in this study, the choice of start date is likely to similarly affect the strength in thresh-
old correlations. The choice of start date also dictates the pattern of heat accumulation and therefore the two
forms of variability that comprise the threshold variation ratio and indicate whether threshold anomalies are
likely to consistently exhibit similar directions.
3.5. Case Studies
Here we demonstrate how the relationships between thresholds could be used in real‐world applications.
We use the DOY the 50‐ and 250‐GDD thresholds were met to predict the DOY 450 GDD would be met at
various locations, including locations with observational phenology submitted by volunteer Nature's
Notebook observers available that can be used to verify the relationships.
3.5.1. Predicting Sumac Flowering in Massachusetts to Support Honey Production
Staghorn sumac (Rhus typhina) ﬂowers are an important pollen and nectar source for honeybees
(Michigan State University Extension, 2018) and honey made from sumac ﬂowers is appreciated for its mel-
low, rich ﬂavor. Staghorn sumac anecdotally noted to ﬂower around 450 GDD (base 10 °C). Knowing the
timing of sumac ﬂowering can guide beekeepers' activities, if honey made from sumac ﬂowers is desired.
Nature's Notebook observers track ﬂowering phenology of staghorn sumac across the eastern United States.

On average, 450 GDD is reached on Grape Island in the Massachusetts Bay on DOY 183 (2 July, ±4 day
[standard deviation]). At this location, the correlation between 50 and 450 GDD is 0.66 and between 250
and 450 GDD is 0.87, offering information that could be leveraged in within‐season forecasting.
In 2011, 50 GDD was met on DOY 125 (5 May), four days earlier than when this threshold is met at this
location, based on the long‐term average. Using this information, 450 GDD was predicted to be met at this
location on DOY 182 (1 July)—one day earlier than normal—with a prediction interval of DOY 175–188.
Subsequently, 250 GDD was met on DOY 160—three days earlier than normal for this location. Using this
information, the prediction for 450 GDD was updated to DOY 181 (30 June), and the prediction interval
narrowed to DOY 177–185. On Grape Island, 450 GDD was actually met on DOY 181. Nature's Notebook
observers reported staghorn sumac in ﬂower on DOY 179 (prior report of not yet in ﬂower DOY 177). At this
particular location, the timing of ﬂowering was predicted accurately eight weeks in advance using the simple
threshold correlation method.
The prediction worked similarly well at this location in 2012, a year with an exceptionally early start to the
spring season. Using the DOY 50 GDD was met—DOY 110 (20 April), 18 days ahead of the long‐term
average—450 GDD was predicted to be met at this location seven days earlier than average—on DOY 176
(prediction interval DOY 169–183). Using the DOY 250 GDD was met (DOY 153), which was 10 days ahead
of schedule, the prediction for 450 GDD remained at DOY 176 and the prediction interval narrowed to DOY
171–180. In actuality, 450 GDD was met at this location on DOY 177. Similarly, Nature's Notebook observers
reported staghorn sumac in ﬂower on DOY 173 (22 June) at this location (prior report of not yet in ﬂower not
in ﬂower DOY 168).
3.5.2. Anticipating the Strawberry Harvest in Minnesota
Strawberries (Fragaria spp.) ripen around 450 GDD (base 10 °C; North Carolina State University Extension,
2016). Advance warning of whether this will occur early, on schedule, or late in a particular year can support
scheduling crews to pick the berries. On average, 450 GDD is reached in Afton, MN, a prime strawberry‐
growing location, on DOY 179 (28 June, ±6 days [standard deviation]). At this location, the correlation
between 50 and 450 GDD is 0.70 and between 250 and 450 GDD is 0.89.
In 2017, another year with a very early start to spring, 50 GDD was met on DOY 115 (25 April), 10 days
earlier than when this threshold is typically met at this location, based on the long‐term average. Using this
information, 450 GDD was predicted to be met at this location on DOY 174 (23 June)—ﬁve days earlier than
normal—with a prediction interval of DOY 165–184. Subsequently, 250 GDD was met on DOY 148—11 days
earlier than normal for this location. Using this information, the prediction for 450 GDD was updated to
DOY 170 (19 June), and the prediction interval narrowed to DOY 163–175. At this location in Minnesota,
450 GDD was actually met on DOY 161 (10 June), 18 days earlier than normal. At this same location,
Nature's Notebook observers reported that Virginia strawberries (Fragaria virginiana) ripe on DOY 159
(prior report of strawberries not yet ripe DOY 150).
In 2018, 50 GDD was met on DOY 124 (4 May), one day early. Using this information, 450 GDD was pre-
dicted to be met at this location one day early, on DOY 178 (prediction interval DOY 169–187). Following
dramatic early‐season warmth, 250 GDD was met on DOY 142, 17 days ahead of schedule, and the
prediction for 450 GDD was updated to DOY 164 (prediction interval DOY 158–171). In actuality, 450
GDD was met at this location on DOY 150 (30 May), nearly a month early. Nature's Notebook observers
reported that strawberries ripe on DOY 155 (prior report of strawberries not yet ripe DOY 151). In both
2017 and 2018, early‐season warmth that resulted in the earlier‐season thresholds to be reached ahead of
schedule predicted an early arrival of 450GDD, though the magnitude of the advancement was too small.
3.5.3. Planning for Insect Pest Management Activities
Several pest insects, including azalea leafminer (Caloptilia azaleela), azalea whiteﬂy (Pealius azaleae), oak
skeletonizer (Bucculatrix ainsliella), pine needle miner (Exoteleia pinifoliella), rose chafer (Macrodactylus
subspinosus), and spruce needle miner (Endothenia albolineane), reach a developmental stage at which
control actions are effective at or around 450 GDD (base 10 °C; Cornell Cooperative Extension, 2010). We
attempted to predict the timing of 450 GDD in 2018 at two locations: one where the correlations between
earlier‐season thresholds and the 450 GDD management threshold are high—near Des Moines, IA
(Figure 2b), and another where they are low—near Nashville, TN (Figure 2b), to demonstrate how the
intraseasonal threshold correlations could be used to inform management activities. In this example, we

do not have observational data to verify predictions. In Des Moines, on average, 54 days lapse between when
50 and 450 GDD are met, and in Nashville, this range is 64 days. Therefore, if the timing of 50 GDD being
met can be used to anticipate when 450 GDD will be met, tree care specialists and natural resource managers
have approximately eight‐week advance warning of whether the event occurring at 450 GDD will be earlier
or later than average in a particular year.
In Des Moines, the correlation between 50 and 450 GDD is 0.71 and between 250 and 450 GDD is 0.90, pro-
viding information that could be leveraged in within‐season forecasting. On average, 450 GDD is reached in
Des Moines on DOY 170 (19 June, ±6 days). In 2018, 50 GDD was met in Des Moines on DOY 125, 11 days
later than average for this location. Using this information, 450 GDD was predicted to be met at this location
on DOY 173 (22 June)—two days later than normal—with a prediction interval of DOY 164–182. Following
an unusually warm period, 250 GDD was met on DOY 146—four days earlier than normal for this location.
Using this additional information, the prediction for 450 GDD was updated to DOY 166 (15 June)—ﬁve days
earlier than average—and the prediction interval shifted to DOY 160–171. In Des Moines, 450 GDD was
actually met on DOY 160 (9 June) in 2018.
In Nashville, the correlation between 50 and 450 GDD is 0.29 and between 250 and 450 GDD is 0.45. Because
the correlation between 50 and 450 GDD is so low, we gain little by using it to make a prediction about when
450 GDD will occur. However, in this location, the DOY 250 GDD is met can still be used to give some
predictive information regarding when 450 GDD will occur. At this location, 250 GDD was met in 2018
on DOY 94 (4 April), 28 days earlier than average. Using this information, 450 GDD was predicted to be
met at this location on DOY 124 (4 May)—20 days earlier than normal—with a prediction interval of
DOY 117–131. At this location, 450 GDD was actually met on DOY 124 (4 May) in 2018, the date that was
predicted four weeks previous.
3.6. Implications and Limitations
Overall, relationships involving early‐season thresholds are relatively weak across base temperatures. Mean
correlations for these comparisons are around 0.5, indicating that only about one quarter of the variance in
the timing of the second threshold is explained by the timing of the ﬁrst threshold. However, higher full‐
season correlations, up to r~0.8, exist at some locations such as higher elevations in the western United
States when calculated using 0 °C base temperature. These locations offer greater promise for anticipating
the timing of later‐season events based on early‐season temperature conditions. Relationships between
later‐season thresholds (250–450 GDD) are much stronger across the country. Many plant and animal spe-
cies commence phenological activity, including ﬁrst bloom, full bloom, egg hatch, and adult emergence at or
near 250 GDD (10 °C base temperature); many other species undergo such events near or beyond 450 GDD
(e.g., Cardina et al., 2011; Cornell Cooperative Extension, 2010; Herms, 2004; Murray, 2008; Wu et al., 2013).
Accordingly, the timing of midseason heat accumulation thresholds can offer valuable information regard-
ing whether later‐season events may be expected to occur earlier or later than expected. This information
may be especially useful for planning management activities when used in conjunction with seasonal and
shorter‐term forecasts. Future research could investigate the weather patterns driving the geographic
patterns in the strength of relationships between earlier‐ and later‐season thresholds. A deeper understand-
ing of the drivers to these patterns on a regional scale would further enhance predictive capacity.
This analysis demonstrates that the choice of base temperature can have a strong impact on the strength of
correlations between two thresholds. The base temperature is the temperature below which accumulated
heat units are biologically irrelevant to species and phenological event of interest; this baseline varies by
species and possibly also by phenophase (Klosterman et al., 2018; Wang, 1960). Applying heat accumulation
threshold correlations in practical applications in a meaningful way necessitates using base temperatures
appropriate to the species and life cycle events of interest. Our case studies demonstrate that this
simple approach, when applied using suitable thresholds and base temperatures, can provide additional
information regarding when events may occur later in the season and can enhance scheduling and
planning decisions.
The utility in using correlations between heat accumulation thresholds to predict the timing of phenological
events applies best to events that are cued primarily by winter and spring‐season accumulated warmth.
Accumulated temperature performs well to predict phenological transitions such as leaf‐out and ﬂowering
10.1029/2019JG005297
Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences
CRIMMINS AND CRIMMINS
2638
as well as later‐spring and summer phenophases in many species (Basler, 2016; Melaas et al., 2016; Olsson &
Jönsson, 2014; Yu et al., 2016). However, many phenological events are also cued by additional variables
such as vernal chilling, daylength, and soil moisture (Flynn & Wolkovich, 2018; Polgar et al., 2014;
Seyednasrollah et al., 2018); temperature threshold correlations could help with prediction, but will
ultimately be insufﬁcient to anticipate the timing for these events.
In this analysis, we chose to evaluate relationships among 50, 250, and 450 GDD, as these thresholds
encompass the portion of the growing season during which accumulated temperature plays the greatest role
in forcing phenological events. The approach undertaken here could be applied using any two thresholds to
evaluate the predictive capacity between two points in the season. Future work could entail building a tool to
calculate relationships between any selected thresholds on any base temperature for a location. However, as
the growing season progresses into summer and autumn, variables such as photoperiod or accumulated chill
can play a larger role in driving phenology (Delpierre et al., 2009; Richardson et al., 2013; Xie et al., 2018) and
this approach may not represent phenological activity as well as in the spring season.
4. Conclusions
Whether the timing of phenological events such as ﬂowering or insect hatch occurring later in the spring
season can be anticipated based on early‐season temperature conditions has the potential to enhance a
planning and scheduling for a wide range of management activities, especially when combined with
seasonal and shorter‐term forecasts. We found that comparisons involving early‐season thresholds were
low. Correlation strength increased thresholds occurring farther into the spring season were compared,
indicating that the timing of midseason heat accumulation thresholds can offer valuable information
regarding whether later‐season events may be expected to occur earlier or later than expected. These
ﬁndings represent a form of ecological forecasting that might enhance intraseasonal planning decisions,
addressing a need that is becoming widely recognized (Bradford et al., 2018; Dietze et al., 2018).
