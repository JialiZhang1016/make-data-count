 Primary sources of atmospheric N 2 O are nitrification and denitrification in terrestrial soils and the ocean, and the main sink is photolysis in the stratosphere.  Studies have mostly focused on the climate-related response of N 2 O during glacial-interglacial periods.  However, its mechanism of variation during the Holocene remains unclear.  We present a high-resolution N 2 O record from the South Pole Ice (SPICE) core covering the Holocene epoch.  The millennial-scale N 2 O trend agrees with existing records.  We constructed a Holocene composite consisting of the new N 2 O measurements in SPICE and existing records from other ice core sites.  The N 2 O composite reveals four distinct periods of N 2 O variation during 11.5-10.0  ka, 10.0-6.2 ka, 6.2-2.2 ka, and 2.2-1.4 ka, including two maxima in 11.0-10.0  ka and 3.0-2.2  ka and minima in 8.8-6.2 ka and approximately 1.4 ka.  Apart from these, our new high-resolution record from SPICE shows a short-term N 2 O decrease around 2.8 ka which is not observed in other records possibly due to lower sample resolution and/or higher age smoothing.  Comparison of our new Holocene N 2 O composite with the paleo-proxy records suggests the plausible linkage of major monsoon (Asian, North African, South and North American, and Australian-Indonesian monsoon) and upwelling (Arabian Sea and Eastern Tropical South Pacific) regions in regulating the atmospheric N 2 O during the Holocene. 

 Plain Language Summary Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) is an important greenhouse and ozone-depleting gas.  The growing level of N 2 O in the atmosphere is of global concern, and records of past N 2 O variations can provide an essential context for understanding the links between N 2 O and climate change.  In this study, we report a new, high-quality N 2 O record covering the Holocene epoch using an ice core obtained from the South Pole.  Our record shows four important periods of N 2 O variation during 11.5-10.0  ka, 10.0-6.2 ka, 6.2-2.2 ka, and 2.2-1.4 ka.  These include two local N 2 O maxima in 11.0-10.0  ka and 3.0-2.2  ka and minima in 8.8-6.2 ka and approximately 1.4 ka.  Comparison with climate records suggests that the variation in monsoon precipitation and ocean productivity contributed to centennial-to millennial-scale N 2 O variations during the Holocene. 



    Introduction Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) is a significant atmospheric greenhouse gas that responds to climate variation and is responsible for stratospheric ozone destruction (Prather et al., 2015) .   Anthropogenic emissions during industrialization have majorly contributed to the remarkable increase in atmospheric N 2 O concentration from ∼270 ppb in 1750 to ∼332 ppb in early 2020 (Machida et al., 1995;  Fluckiger et al., 2002;  Rubino et al., 2019 ; N 2 O hemispheric and global monthly mean from the ESRL/NOAA 2020).   Recent estimates suggest an anthropogenic contribution of ∼40% in the current total N 2 O emission (IPCC AR6, 2021), whereas 60% of the emissions originate from natural sources.  Terrestrial and oceanic sources account for ∼60% and ∼40% of N 2 O emissions from the natural environment, respectively (Battaglia & Joos, 2018;  Tian et al., 2020) .  

 Variations in pre-industrial N 2 O emissions from diverse sources are closely correlated with ecological processes regulating the cycling of nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) on land and in the ocean (Gruber & Galloway, 2008) .   N 2 O production is contingent on metabolic processes (nitrification and denitrification) performed by specific groups of bacteria (Stehfest & Bouwman, 2006;  Xu et al., 2017) .   Some hotspots of the globe, where major N 2 O contributions from these processes occur include the terrestrial soils in the tropical forests and marine suboxic waters around the major upwelling regions overlying the oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) (Babbin et al., 2015;  Cohen & Gordon, 1979;  Joos et al., 2020) .   The net N 2 O produced during these processes depends on environmental conditions and production pathways (Joos et al., 2020) .   These conditions include temperature, water and oxygen levels, substrate availability etc. (Wang et al., 2018;  Zhuang et al., 2012) .   The major terrestrial N 2 O effluxes are associated with tropical areas, including Central and South America, Central Africa, and Southeast Asia (Xu et al., 2017) .   In such areas, denitrification is predominant in producing N 2 O, with limited contribution from nitrification under low oxygen conditions in soils (Joos et al., 2020) .  

 On the other hand, primary sites for marine N 2 O emissions occur in coastal upwelling systems around major OMZs (Agnihotri et al., 2006;  Naqvi & Noronha, 1991) .   In the productive regions, microbial respiration during the decomposition of organic matter leads to the formation of anoxic waters (less than 10 nmol L 1 of O 2 ), also known as oxygen-deficient zones (ODZs) (Tiano et al., 2014) .   These ODZs are surrounded by a large volume of hypoxic waters (below 20 μmol L 1 of O 2 ), which accelerates denitrification at the core of the anoxic zone and nitrification at the oxic-anoxic interface, making OMZs one of the significant sources of N 2 O (Babbin et al., 2015;  Ji et al., 2015) .  

 The primary sinks for N 2 O are the stratospheric photolysis of N 2 O by ultraviolet light and its chemical reaction with excited oxygen (Minschwaner et al., 1998) .   N 2 O has a relatively long atmospheric lifetime (approximately 123 ± 10 years) and therefore mixes effectively in the troposphere, reflecting similar values globally for a particular time (Prather et al., 2015) .   Hence, the N 2 O concentration retrieved from the ice cores can be a potential proxy for studying variations in the global nitrogen cycle. 

 During the last few decades, several detailed ice core N 2 O records covering different aspects have been established (Fischer et al., 2019;  Flückiger et al., 2002  Flückiger et al., , 2004;;  Schilt et al., 2010  Schilt et al., , 2013;;  Spahni et al., 2005) .   These include the glacial-interglacial N 2 O variability and millennial-scale N 2 O variations since the last glacial period, with a focus on N 2 O response to abrupt climate events (Fischer et al., 2019;  Flückiger et al., 1999  Flückiger et al., , 2002;;  Schilt et al., 2010  Schilt et al., , 2013;;  Spahni et al., 2005) .   On a glacial-interglacial timescale, concentrations of N 2 O fluctuate between 280 and 180 ppb during warm and cold periods, respectively (Schilt et al., 2013) .   These climate variations have also been associated with changes in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) (Henry et al., 2016;  Pedro et al., 2018) .   The weakening of the AMOC causes a shift in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) southward, leading to the weakening of tropical monsoon precipitation (Wang et al., 2007) as well as the variation in OMZ strength around the Arabian Sea and Pacific Ocean  (Pichevin et al., 2007;  Schmittner et al., 2007) .   Hence, rapid climate change (warming/cooling) is believed to affect both terrestrial and marine sources of N 2 O production (Pichevin et al., 2007;  Schmittner et al., 2007) .   Flückiger et al. (2002) focused on the N 2 O variation during the entire Holocene and reported a local N 2 O minimum at ∼8 ka (thousand years before present or ka where the present is 1950 CE).   The study also suggested that the N 2 O record is more similar to the CO 2 record than the CH 4 record during the Holocene.  Ryu et al. (2020) studied the high-resolution N 2 O records for the last two millennia and reported a pronounced N 2 O minimum at ∼600 CE (∼1.4 ka) coeval with the reorganization of tropical hydroclimate and changes in ocean productivity.   However, the detailed feedback mechanism responsible for the N 2 O-climate relationship and its interdependence with terrestrial and marine processes during the entire Holocene remains elusive owing to the lack of high-resolution N 2 O records covering the Holocene. 

 We present a new high-resolution N 2 O record from the South Pole Ice (SPICE) core during the last ∼11 thousand years.  Additionally, a composite N 2 O record is constructed by combining the new measurements from SPICE with the existing records from other ice cores.  The results provide insight into the key drivers of atmospheric N 2 O on millennial time scales during the Holocene. 



 Materials and Methods  Site Description The SP14 core site is located near the geographical South Pole (89.99°S, 98.16°W) at a surface elevation of 2,835 m.  The ice accumulation rate around the SPICE site is 8 cm water-equivalent per year or w.e./yr (Lilien et al., 2018;  Mosley-Thompson et al., 1999) , and the annual mean temperature measured in the firn is 51°C  (Severinghaus et al., 2001) .   Under modern climatological conditions, the estimated age spread of enclosed air for the SPICE site (calculated by the width of the age distribution curve at half height) is around 65 years (Battle et al., 1996;  Buizert, 2012) .   The age difference between trapped bubbles (gas age) and surrounding ice (ice age) is referred to as the Δage (Bender et al., 2006) .   The Holocene value of Δage for the SPICE site is ∼1000 ± 50 years, calculated by a firn densification model and empirical matching of CH 4 gas chronology (Epifanio et al., 2020) .  



 N 2 O Measurement We applied a high-precision wet extraction (double melt-refreeze) method for SPICE ice, as Ryu et al. (2018) described.   We used 17-18 g of ice for each measurement.  The ice cutting was performed in a walk-in freezer maintained at approximately 20°C.  The trimmed ice pieces were placed in specially designed glass flasks and bolted on a flat flange with a copper gasket for sealing under a high vacuum while attached to the vacuum extraction line.  Laboratory-made bubble-free high-purity ice was also used for blank correction.  The glass sample cups were initially submerged in a pre-chilled ethanol bath ( 75°C) and evacuated for approximately 50 min to remove the ambient air in the flask and any contaminants on the ice surface.  After evacuation, the ice pieces were melted to liberate the enclosed air and collected in the headspace of each sample flask.  Subsequently, the meltwater was refrozen before analysis.  The concentration of N 2 O in the liberated air in the headspace of each sample flask was measured using an Agilent 7890b gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a micro-electron capture detector.  We analyzed standard air with an N 2 O concentration of 265 ppb from the National Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration (NOAA) before and after the sample measurement.  Due to the high solubility of N 2 O in water, we repeated the N 2 O measurement during the second melt-refreeze cycle, which corrected ∼3% (6-8 ppb) of the total N 2 O concentration.  Therefore, high-precision wet extraction (double melt-refreeze) is an accurate method to obtain the precise N 2 O concentration in ice core samples, which would otherwise result in 6-8 ppb lower concentrations with a single melt-refreeze cycle (Ryu et al., 2018) .   A total of 177 sample depths with at least two horizontal replicates were measured.  The inter-day precision during the N 2 O measurement was determined by measuring more replicates (three or four) from 19 depths and calculating their pooled standard deviation.  Further, to calculate the overall N 2 O precision in the SPICE core, including ice quality and experimental uncertainty, we selected long ice pieces (∼20 cm each) from five different depths.  Eight continuous measurements were done (at ∼2 cm intervals) from each of the five long ice pieces (n = 40) (Table S1 in Supporting Information S1).   The obtained raw N 2 O values were corrected for gravitational correction using the average δ 15 N of N 2 of the SPICE core during the Holocene (0.539 ‰) and the following equation: 

 N 2 O corrected = N 2 O measured (1 ΔM δ 15 N 1000 )  where ΔM = 15.05 g/mol which refers to the difference between the masses of air (28.96 g/mol) and mass of N 2 O (44.013 g/mol).  The gravitational correction decreased the final N 2 O concentration by ∼2.5 ppb.  The average analytical uncertainty for repeated measurements in SPICE is 1.3 ppb which is better than the uncertainties reported in previous studies ranging between 2.5 and 3.6 ppb (Figure 1 ).  



 N 2 O Composite We prepared a composite N 2 O record of the Holocene using our results from SPICE samples measured at 177 different depths and existing records from EPICA Dome C (EDC), Dronning Maud Land (EDML) (Flückiger et al., 2002;  Schilt et al., 2010) , Talos Dome Ice (TALDICE), North Greenland Ice Core Project (NGRIP)  (Fischer et al., 2019) , Law Dome  (Rubino et al., 2019) and Styx and NEEM  (Ryu et al., 2020) ice cores.   The modern records of N 2 O concentrations from atmospheric monitoring show an interhemispheric gradient of ∼0.8 ppb and it is likely to be smaller during pre-industrial time due to higher anthropogenic emissions in the Northern Hemisphere (Ishijima et al., 2009) , which is well within the individual analytical uncertainties of each ice core record.   Therefore, N 2 O records from Antarctic and Greenland ice cores were used without further inter-hemispheric correction in preparing the Holocene N 2 O composite.  A correction for gravitational fractionation based on the average δ 15 N of N 2 at each ice core site was also applied to the other ice core records except Law Dome, which is already corrected (Rubino et al., 2019) .   The N 2 O record from each ice core was synchronized to the common WD2014 age scale (Sigl et al., 2016 ; See Supporting Information S1 for more details).   For each record, the N 2 O concentration is interpolated to get the yearly-resolved N 2 O curves before constructing a composite N 2 O curve.  We used the Monte Carlo average (MCA) method with a 250-year running average to understand the millennial- (Prather et al., 2015) and the stratosphere-troposphere mass exchange rate of 5.37 ± 0.26 × 10 17 kg yr 1  (Ishijima et al., 2007) with a 250 yr cut-off period (COP).   Each run was executed by random propagation within the uncertainty range of N 2 O concentration, N 2 O lifetime, and stratosphere-troposphere exchange rate using the Monte Carlo approach across all the possibilities (n = 10,000).  We also performed a sensitivity test of our 2-box model for different N 2 O lifetimes and stratosphere-troposphere exchange rates fixed at the maximum, minimum and average values.  Initially, we fixed the N 2 O lifetimes to 133, 123 and 113 (std dev = 0) and performed runs for each scenario.  We observed a significant increase of ±0.85 TgN/yr in the total N 2 O flux with a decrease of 10 yrs in the N 2 O lifetime which is similar to the 1 sigma uncertainty of our results of total N 2 O flux.  We also performed a similar test with the S-T exchange rate for three scenarios by fixing the values to the maximum (5.63 × 10 17 kg yr 1 ), minimum (5.11 × 10 17 kg yr 1 ) and average (5.37 × 10 17 kg yr 1 ).  The results indicate a significant change in (Grubbs, 1969) .   Refer text for more details. 



 Earth and Space Science N 2 O flux (±0.04 TgN/yr) between the maximum and minimum values of the S-T exchange rate used in the model (Figure S3 in Supporting Information S1).  



 Data Quality The SPICE site has a fairly low ice accumulation rate of ∼8 cm w.e./yr, resulting in relatively high smoothing in the gas record owing to gas diffusion and gradual bubble close-off processes in the firn column.  The CH 4 age-distribution curve for the firn densification model of the SPICE site suggests a width of approximately 65 years at half height (Battle et al., 1996;  Buizert, 2012) .   Hence, any abrupt change in N 2 O from its preceding or successive value within 65 years may be considered an outlier, as these would not be representative of the actual atmospheric signals.  Such outliers may arise owing to chemical interactions or microbial processes (Fischer et al., 2019;  Flückiger et al., 2002) , and experimental errors arising from contamination during ice trimming and/or drift due to background sensitivity of the GC experiments  (Ryu et al., 2018) .   To overcome the GC drift, we repeated the measurement using replicated ice samples from each depth after a few weeks and averaged for the final N 2 O concentration (Figure 1 ).   The average standard deviation for replicate measurements was 1.3 ppb.  The intra-day precision was calculated by averaging the pooled standard deviation of daily blank ice measurements, which is 1.8 ppb.  The outliers in the multiple N 2 O measurements at five depths were statistically rejected using the Grubbs test (Grubbs, 1969) .   The pooled standard deviation for samples measured three or more times on different days was 1.8 ppb (n = 41).  On the other hand, the pooled standard deviation of continuous measurement of long ice pieces (at 2 cm intervals) was 2.5 ppb.  Furthermore, the measured N 2 O in the SPICE core over the last 2,200 years was compared with the high-resolution N 2 O records of Styx and NEEM ice cores (Ryu et al., 2020) (Figure  S4 in Supporting Information S1); which demonstrates consistency A well-known concern for ice core N 2 O data is the possibility of in situ production of N 2 O  (Flückiger et al., 2002;  Schilt et al., 2010) .   The in situ N 2 O production could result from biotic and abiotic origins (Rohde et al., 2008;  Samarkin et al., 2010) .   The microbes in ice may oxidize NH + 4 (substrate) to nitrate (nitrification) or reduce nitrate to nitrogen gas (denitrification) and produce N 2 O as an in situ intermediate product (Phillippot et al., 2007;  Röthlisberger et al., 2000;  Sowers, 2001) .   Such N 2 O production may contribute to high N 2 O concentrations observed at specific depths depending on the concentration of impurities that facilitate the in-situ processes.  This raises an important question as to whether all the N 2 O data measured in the SPICE core covering the Holocene represent the atmospheric concentration or if some of them are elevated owing to in situ N 2 O production.  In general, ice from warmer periods, such as the Holocene, is expected to be least affected by impurities that are carried by the dust deposited with snow (Fischer et al., 2019;  Flückiger et al., 2002) .   This is due to the higher dust deposition during glacial than interglacial periods (Schilt et al., 2010) .   It is worth noting that the ice in Greenland typically contains higher levels of dust than the ice found in Antarctica.  (Flückiger et al., 2002;  Lee et al., 2020) .   To assess these possibilities, we compared our N 2 O data with high-resolution non-sea-salt calcium (nssCa 2+ ) concentrations (Winski et al., 2019) (Figure  3 and Figure  S5 in Supporting Information S1).   nssCa 2+ is an indicator of dust content in ice, which may indirectly correspond to the microbial content in the ice samples (Röthlisberger et al., 2000) .   The fluctuations in high-resolution N 2 O data did not significantly correlate with the cm-scale changes in the nssCa 2+ record (see Figure S6 in Supporting Information S1).   These observations suggest that the Holocene N 2 O record of the SPICE core may not be affected by Ca (dust)-related in-situ N 2 O production.  Overall, the new N 2 O measurements presented here have good reproducibility during replicate measurements.  On the other hand, the continuous measurement of long ice pieces (2 cm interval) also shows a similar reproducibility at four out of five depths (Table S1 in Supporting Information S1).   Considering the 65-yr width of the gas age distribution curve and accumulation rate (8 cm/yr) at the SPICE site, eight pieces used in continuous measurement should represent ∼2 yr age, which should ideally have a similar N 2 O concentration.  However, one of the depth intervals (305 m) shows higher variation within 20 cm unrelated to Ca (dust), possibly due to an additional factor that increases the observed variability on these short time intervals. 



 Results Here, using SPICE, we extend the high-resolution N 2 O record further to cover the last 11 ka (Figure 1 ).   The N 2 O data from the SPICE core are consistent with existing records on millennial timescales and reveal new details on the multi-centennial scale.  The SPICE N 2 O concentration shows a variation of 20 ppb between 11 and 8 ka, with a maximum of 273 ppb and a minimum of 253 ppb.  From 8.0 ka to 3.3 ka, there was a gradual increase of 21 ppb in SPICE N 2 O concentration, with a maximum of 274 ppb and a minimum of 253 ppb.  Following this, there was a sudden drop of 15 ppb in SPICE N 2 O concentration centering around 2.8 ka.  Between 2.8 and 2.2 ka, the N 2 O concentration at the SPICE site rose by 15 ppb, followed by an 18 ppb decrease between 2.2 ka and 1.4 ka.  The N 2 O minima (at 8.0 ka and 1.4 ka) and maximum at 2.2 ka observed in our high-resolution data from the SPICE site are also observed in other ice core records such as EDC, EDML, TALDICE, and NGRIP (Fischer et al., 2019;  Flückiger et al., 2002;  Schilt et al., 2010) (Figure  2 ).   However, the N 2 O minimum at 2.8 ka is not observed in the existing low-resolution records from other ice core sites.  The maximum available data points between 2.5 and 3.0 ka are from SPICE which shows a significant drop in N 2 O concentration around 2.8 ka.  The MCA curve of SPICE-only data between 3.5 and 1.0 ka shows a prominent 8 ppb (∼0.5 TgNyr 1 ) decrease around 2.8 ka (Figure S1 in Supporting Information S1).   On the other hand, the N 2 O record of Dome-C does not show any change in concentration around 2.8 ka, possibly due to higher smoothing and wider age distribution at Dome-C than at the SPICE site.  This means that there could be several multi-centennial atmospheric signals that may be observed only in ice core records of lower age smoothing (e.g., Styx, NEEM, Law Dome or even SPICE) but may not be archived in EDC, even in the higher sample resolution records.  Hence, the short-term N 2 O drop in SPICE at around 2.8 ka may likely represent a true atmospheric signal which is not captured in other N 2 O records possibly due to lower sample resolution and/or higher age smoothing. 

 We prepared an MCA N 2 O composite to cover the entire Holocene (considering the sample gaps in our new SPICE record) by compiling our new N 2 O results with the available records from EDC, EDML, TALDICE, Styx, NEEM, Law Dome, and NGRIP ice core (Law Dome, Styx, and NEEM cover only last ∼2 ka) averaged at 250 years (Figure 2 ).   The main distinctive features of the Holocene N 2 O variations observed in our N 2 O composite include two N 2 O maxima at approximately 11-10 ka and 3-2.2 ka, followed by minima at approximately 8-6 ka and ∼1.4 ka, respectively.  These millennial-scale features observed in our new N 2 O composite agree well with the N 2 O composite record of Fischer et al. (2019) .   With the addition of new high-resolution N 2 O measurements from SPICE, Styx and NEEM sites, our new MCA composite shows 2-3 ppb lower N 2 O values as compared to the MCA composite of Fischer et al. (2019) (Figure  S7 in Supporting Information S1).   Overall, we observe a range of ∼15 ppb in N 2 O during the Holocene, along with four distinct periods of N 2 O change during 11.5-10.0  ka, 10.0-6.2 ka, 6.2-2.2 ka, and 2.2-1.4 ka.  The most considerable N 2 O variation corresponds to the beginning of the Holocene (between 11.5 and 11.0 ka), where we observed an abrupt ∼15 ppb increase in atmospheric N 2 O based on mainly previous published records (Fischer et al., 2019;  Schilt et al., 2014) , which corresponds to a ∼0.8 TgNyr 1 increase in total N 2 O flux within 500 years assuming no change in N 2 O lifetime (Figure  S3 in Supporting Information S1).   The main cause was attributed to the resumption of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) during the Preboreal Oscillation (PB) (Henry et al., 2016;  Pedro et al., 2018) .  

 The composite record shows a noticeable decrease of ∼10 ppb during 10.0-8.8 ka corresponding to a decrease of ∼0.5 TgNyr 1 in total N 2 O flux (Figure S2 in Supporting Information S1), which was followed by a prolonged N 2 O minimum between 8.8 and 6.2 ka.   Thereafter, the record shows a progressive increase in atmospheric N 2 O concentration (∼12 ppb) corresponding to a ∼0.5 TgNyr 1 increase in total N 2 O flux between 6.2 and 3.0 ka.  Finally, the N 2 O record shows another maximum at 3.0-2.2  ka, followed by a decrease over the next ∼800 yrs to attain a minimum at around 1.4 ka.  The 1.4 ka local N 2 O minimum was also reported by a recent N 2 O study from Styx, NEEM, and Law Dome ice core sites (MacFarling Meure et al., 2006;  Rubino et al., 2019;  Ryu et al., 2020) .   Subsequently, the pre-industrial increase of N 2 O after 1.4 ka might be related to the increased agricultural activities (Syakila & Kroeze, 2011;  Xu et al., 2017) .   Overall, the new SPICE record, combined with the existing records shows new features of N 2 O variations on millennial time scales during the Holocene. 



 Discussion The Holocene variation of all the three major greenhouse gases CO 2 , CH 4 , and N 2 O provides interesting information about the regional climate variation influencing their production and emission from major source areas Earth and Space Science 10.1029/2023EA002840 (Flückiger et al., 2002) .   It is estimated that the ocean has been a dominant CO 2 source, whereas the terrestrial regions have been a net carbon sink during the Holocene (Brovkin et al., 2019;  Goodwin et al., 2011) .   On the other hand, early and middle Holocene changes in atmospheric methane are related to the changes in Northern tropical wetlands (Yang et al., 2017;  Zheng et al., 2014) , whereas the late Holocene increase in atmospheric CH 4 is linked with the increase in orbitally controlled tropical sources, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere  (Beck et al., 2018;  Singarayer et al., 2011) .   However, the atmospheric N 2 O variation during the Holocene is attributed to changes in both land and ocean N 2 O sources (Flückiger et al., 2002) .   Our new Holocene N 2 O composite shows two distinct N 2 O maxima around PB (11-10 ka) and 3-2.2 ka, followed by successive minima at 8.8-6.2 ka and around 1.4 ka, respectively.  N 2 O production and emission in terrestrial environments primarily depend on temperature and precipitation changes that alter soil texture and moisture content (Liu et al., 2015) , microbial ecology  (Zhang et al., 2013) , and substrate availability  (Bai et al., 2013) .   In general, increased temperature and precipitation enhance N 2 O emissions from soils (Bouwman et al., 2002;  Potter et al., 1996) .   The main terrestrial N 2 O source is the Tropical Forest and the precipitation changes during the monsoon season are suggested to be the important factor which influences the N 2 O variability in these regions (Stehfest & Bouwman, 2006;  Xu et al., 2017) .   On the other hand, marine N 2 O production in oxic waters is dominated by nitrification (Battaglia & Joos, 2018) , whereas the denitrification process dominates surrounding OMZ regions with a limited contribution from nitrification  (Frey et al., 2020;  Ji et al., 2015) .   The highest marine N 2 O production and efflux are concentrated around sub-oxic waters with high productivity (Cohen & Gordon, 1978;  Suntharalingam et al., 2000) .   The expansion of hypoxia in the water column during intensified OMZ causes an increase in marine production and outgassing of N 2 O (Babbin et al., 2015;  Ji et al., 2015;  Naqvi et al., 2000) .   It is estimated that the majority of marine N 2 O emissions come from regions where highly productive waters overlay shallow OMZs, such as the Eastern Tropical South Pacific (ETSP) and the Arabian Sea (AS) (Arevalo- Martinez et al., 2015;  Yang et al., 2020) .   Therefore, to investigate further, we compared our N 2 O composite with individual paleo-proxies of tropical precipitation and temperature as well as the marine oxygen minimum zone to understand the processes that occurred during the Holocene concerning the change in terrestrial and marine N 2 O sources, respectively (Figures 4 and  5 ).   Further, we conducted a correlation test by analyzing correlation coefficients between the N 2 O composite and the paleo-proxy records from the vital regions for each period with the possible lead/lag times (Table 1 ).   To establish correlations on land, we compared the speleothem records of oxygen isotope (δ 18 O), which serves as a proxy for past rainfall in major monsoon regions.  For marine correlations, we examined the records of nitrogen isotope ratios (δ 15 N) in marine sediments, which is a good indicator of the subsurface denitrification process around oxygen minimum zones.  Such correlations are not necessarily a causal connection throughout the Holocene but may give an idea about the plausible N 2 O source during the important periods of N 2 O variation discussed in this study. 



 11.5-10.0 ka The composite record shows a significant N 2 O increase of ∼15 ppb (∼0.8 TgNyr 1 ) during 11.5-11 ka followed by an N 2 O maximum between 11 and 10 ka (Figure 2 & Figure  S2 in Supporting Information S1).   Looking at the air temperature record from South China, which is known for its high N 2 O production, it is evident that there was a significant increase in temperature between 11.5 and 10.0 ka (Shi et al., 2021) (Figure  4 ).   Following this increase, there was a decreasing trend after 10 ka.  Further, we compared the oxygen isotope (δ 18 O) record of speleothem (a proxy for the past monsoon rainfall) from major monsoon regions with our N 2 O composite.  The δ 18 O signatures of calcite are controlled by the seepage water in the caves, which preserves the records of past precipitation such that the increase in precipitation is reflected by a negative excursion in δ 18 O.  The Asian Monsoon speleothem records from Dongge Cave suggest an intensification of the Asian Monsoon between 11.5 and 10.0 ka, which is followed by a declining Asian Monsoon trend during the Middle and Late Holocene (Dykoski et al., 2005) (Figure  4 ).   On the other hand, the monsoon records of other regions show variable patterns during each of the periods.  Furthermore, the correlation test indicates a good correlation of N 2 O trend with Asian (Dongge Cave), N. American (Pink Panther), N. African (Soreq Cave) and Indonesian-Australian Monsoon (Liang Luar Cave) regions (Asmerom et al., 2007;  Bar-Matthews & Ayalon, 2011;  Dykoski et al., 2005;  Griffiths et al., 2009) .   These observations are in agreement with the N 2 O isotope-based terrestrial flux (F land ) record of Fischer et al. (2019) showing ∼0.3 TgNyr 1 increase in terrestrial N 2 O emission between 11.5 and 10 ka (Figure  4 ).  

 Looking at marine records, we compared the N 2 O composite with the δ 15 N signatures in marine sediments from major oxygen minimum zones (ETSP and AS) (Figure 5 ).   The δ 15 N record from both AS (RC-27-23 and RC-27-14) and ETSP (GeoB7139-2 and M772-03-2) exhibits enriched values, indicating strong OMZ conditions, which reflect higher N 2 O emissions from these regions between 11.5 and 10.0 ka (Altabet et al., 2002;  De-Pol-Holz et al., 2007;  Mollier-Vogel et al., 2019) (Figure  5 ).   These observations are also reflected in the correlation analysis results showing a highly correlated N 2 O composite and δ 15 N of bulk sediment around the Chile Margin (Site GeoB7139-2), Peru Margin (Site M772-03-02), and AS (Site RC-27-23) indicating high N 2 O emission from these regions (Table 1 ).   At the same time, the N 2 O isotope-based ocean flux (F ocean ) shows a notable ∼0.6 TgNyr 1 increase in marine N 2 O emission (Fischer et al., 2019) (Figure  5 ).   These observations suggest that the rise in atmospheric N 2 O concentration between 11.5 and 10.0 ka was caused by the increased emissions from both terrestrial and marine N 2 O sources. 



 10.0-6.2 ka The N 2 O composite shows a prominent ∼10 ppb (∼0.5 TgNyr 1 ) decrease between 10.0 and 8.8 ka which was followed by a prolonged N 2 O minimum between 8.8 and 6.2 ka.  These trends are similar to the early-mid-Holocene decrease in atmospheric CH 4 , attributed to the decline in Northern and Southern Hemisphere emissions during the early and mid-Holocene respectively (Beck et al., 2018) .   During the same period (between 10.0 and 6.2 ka), the Asian and N. African monsoons show insignificant correlation (|r| < 0.3) with the N 2 O trend whereas the N. American Monsoon shows a weak correlation (Table 1 ).   On the other hand, the Southern Hemisphere monsoon shows intensification during the N 2 O decrease.  Looking at the marine records, δ 15 N-proxy records from both the Arabian Sea and ETSP show a contemporaneous decrease by 2-4‰, indicating a largescale weakening of OMZs related to the deepening of oxycline in those regions (Agnihotri et al., 2006;  Altabet et al., 2002;  De-Pol-Holz et al., 2007;  Mollier-Vogel et al., 2019) .   Such prominent weakening of OMZ between 10 and 6.2 ka might have reduced the large-scale production of N 2 O in the Arabian Sea and ETSP, significantly contributing to the formation of the N 2 O minimum between 8.8 and 6.2 ka. 

 We also compared the individual responses of terrestrial (temperature and precipitation changes) and marine (denitrification and OMZ changes) proxies from major N 2 O-producing regions during 8.8-6.2 ka minimum.  For this purpose, we calculated the average Z-score of each record for the period between 8.8 and 6.2 ka and the rest of the Holocene (see Supporting Information S1 for more details on the calculation of the Z-Scores) (Figures S8-S12 in Supporting Information S1).  The paleo-proxy record illustrates wet and warm conditions around the Asian Monsoon region between 8.8 and 6.2 ka (Berkelhammer et al., 2012;  Dykoski et al., 2005;  Fleitmann et al., 2007;  Hu et al., 2008) (Figure  S8 in Supporting Information S1).   In contrast, South America experienced dry conditions during the same period (Bird et al., 2011;  Van Breukelen et al., 2008;  Wang et al., 2007) (Figure  6 and Figure  S8 in Supporting Information S1).   The average Z-score of δ 15 N records from both ETSP and AS indicates the prolonged weakening of OMZ and reduced N 2 O production in both regions during 8.8-6.2 ka (Figure S11 in Supporting Information S1).   Hence, the N 2 O minimum between 8.8 and 6.2 ka mainly correlates with the prominent decrease in marine N 2 O production around the upwelling centers.  These results corroborate the findings of Fischer et al. (2019) , suggesting a gradual decrease of F ocean by ∼1 TgNyr 1 , whereas the F land shows a secular trend between 10 and 6 ka (Figures  4 and  5 ).   All these observations suggest that the notable decrease in atmosphere concentration between 10.0 and 6.2 ka is attributed to the significant drop in emission from the marine N 2 O sources. 



 6.2-2.2 ka Between 6.2 and 3.0 ka, the N 2 O composite shows a progressive increase (∼12 ppb or ∼0.5 TgNyr 1 ), which is followed by another N 2 O maximum at 3.0-2.2  ka.  The N 2 O increase correlates with the intensification of Southern Hemisphere monsoons (South American and Australian-Indonesian) whereas the Asian and N. African monsoons show a weakening trend between 6.2 and 2.2 ka (Tables 1 and  2 ).   The contemporary increase in the preindustrial atmospheric CH 4 is also attributed to the increase in the emissions from the Southern Hemisphere (Beck (Fischer et al., 2019) with the terrestrial temperature and precipitation records (δ 18 O of cave deposits) of major monsoon regions of the world: (Top to Bottom) Simulated temperature anomaly of South China  (Shi et al., 2021) ; Dongge Cave, China  (Dykoski et al., 2005) ; Pink Panther Cave, USA  (Asmerom et al., 2007) ; Laguna Pumacocha, Peru  (Bird et al., 2011) ; Cold Air Cave, South Africa  (Holmgren et al., 2003) ; Liang Luar Cave, Indonesia  (Griffiths et al., 2009) .   The black curves over Dongge Cave and Laguna Pumacocha represent the summer insolation (W/m 2 ) of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres at 15° (Berger & Loutre, 1991) .   It should be noted that the N 2 O composite and F Land are synchronized with WD2014 and AICC2012 gas-age scales respectively. 

 Earth and Space Science 10. 1029  /2023EA002840 et al., 2018;;  Singrayer et al., 2011) .   In the marine records, the AS and ETSP show a gradual increase in the denitrification process between 6.2 and 2.2 ka, indicating the intensification of OMZ, promotion of N 2 O production, and outgassing from those regions (Agnihotri et al., 2006;  Altabet et al., 2002;  Azharuddin et al., 2022;  De-Pol-Holz et al., 2007;  Mollier-Vogel et al., 2019) .   The correlation results also suggest that the N 2 O trend during that period corresponds to the intensification in Southern Hemisphere Monsoons and OMZs in AS and ETSP.  (Agnihotri et al., 2006  ), GeoB7139-2 (De-Pol-Holz et al., 2007) , and Arabian Sea sites RC2714, RC-2723  (Altabet et al., 2002) and SK-148/55  (Kessarkar et al., 2018) .   It should be noted that the N 2 O composite and F ocean are synchronized with WD2014 and AICC2012 gas-age scales respectively. 

 Earth and Space Science 10.1029/2023EA002840  

 2.2-1.4 ka The N 2 O record shows a prominent 8 ppb (∼0.3 TgNyr 1 ) decrease between 2.2 ka and 1.4 ka, leading to an N 2 O minimum at around 1.4 ka.  During the same period, the Asian and Australian-Indonesian monsoons show weakening (Tables 1 and  2 ).   On the other hand, the δ 15 N of bulk sediment at Peru Margin sites PC-2 and M772-03 shows a ∼2‰ decrease indicating the weakened OMZ in the region (Agnihotri et al., 2006;  Mollier-Vogel et al., 2019) .   At the same time, both F land & F ocean show a notable decrease in emissions centering around 1.4 ka (Fischer et al., 2019) (Figures  4 and  5 ).   The N 2 O minimum at 1.4 ka (∼600 CE) was previously reported from Styx and NEEM ice core sites and was attributed to the changes in tropical hydroclimate and ocean productivity (Ryu et al., 2020) .

 Conclusions We present the millennial-scale N 2 O variation during the Holocene epoch obtained from the SPICE core.  The results demonstrate agreement with other existing ice core records from Antarctica and Greenland on a millennial scale.  Furthermore, the new high-resolution record from SPICE shows a centennial-scale N 2 O minimum around 2.8 ka which is not observed in other ice core records possibly due to lower sample resolution and/or higher age smoothing.  We prepared a Holocene N 2 O composite by combining the new SPICE results with the existing N 2 O records.  Our N 2 O composite exhibits four distinct periods of N 2 O variation consisting of two N 2 O maxima during 11-10 ka and 3.0-2.2  ka, followed by two minima during 8.8-6.2 ka and at around 1.4 ka, respectively.  The most significant N 2 O increase (∼15 ppb or ∼0.8 TgNyr 1 ) is observed between 11.5 and 10.0 ka, which corresponds to the increased precipitation around major monsoon regions and intensified the Arabian Sea and Chile Margin OMZ.  Subsequently, the ∼0.5 TgNyr 1 decrease in N 2 O flux between 10.0 and 6.2 ka may plausibly be associated with the reduced N 2 O emission owing to aridification in the South American monsoon region and weakening of the Arabian Sea and ETSP OMZ.  Between 6.2 and 2.2 ka, the progressive increase (∼12 ppb or ∼0.5 TgNyr 1 ) in atmospheric N 2 O leading to another N 2 O maximum from 3.0 to 2.2 ka are associated with the high N 2 O emissions owing to increased precipitation of Southern Hemisphere monsoons and intensified OMZ conditions around the ETSP and the Arabian Sea.  Another significant N 2 O decrease at 1.4 ka is attributed to the decrease in Northern Hemisphere temperature, reduced precipitation in Asian and Indonesian-Australian monsoon regions, and weakened OMZ around ETSP. Scenario-based numerical modeling studies are required to better understand the relationship between climate and N 2 O variation during the Holocene.  In addition, the high-resolution study of N 2 O isotopologues (δ 15 N, δ 18 O, and site preference of N 2 O molecules) focusing on the Holocene epoch may further help resolve the individual contribution of marine and terrestrial sources and their variation during N 2 O maxima and minima. 



   atmospheric N 2 O during the Holocene.  The uncertainty associated with the MCA record was implemented by repeating the MCA algorithm 10,000 times (Figure2and FigureS1in Supporting Information S1).  See Supporting Information S1 for more details on the MCA and uncertainty calculations.2.4.  Total Flux CalculationsN 2 O emissions were estimated by calculating the total N 2 O flux from the N 2 O composite using a two-box model (Figure S2 in Supporting Information S1).  The box model of Schilt et al. (2014) was modified using the method by Ryu et al. (2020) to calculate the total N 2 O flux without using the N 2 O isotopologues (δ 15 N and δ 18 O of N 2 O).  Due to the lack of isotope data, we could not distinguish the N 2 O fluxes from terrestrial and marine sources.  The model assumed the stratosphere and troposphere as individual boxes where the stratospheric N 2 O destruction and troposphere-stratosphere N 2 O exchange were well constrained.  The model used the tropospheric N 2 O lifetime of 123 ± 10 years
