Abstract. In historic masonry buildings, wood can be embedded in the walls as storey partition beams, or as 
supportive wall plates. Half-timbered masonry constructions, or wooden frames, e.g. combined with internal 
insulation, are other examples of wooden elements. Wood decaying fungi can cause serious damage to wood, 
which may lose mass and strength, ultimately yielding the risk of collapse. In addition, some fungal species 
may even be hazardous for occupants. All wood decaying fungi depend on favorable moisture and temperature 
conditions, although the threshold conditions may vary with various fungal species and types, and state of the 
wood. To predict the risk of occurrence of wood rot, several models have been developed, however most of 
these are based on a limited number of experiments, or very specific cases. For these reasons, the applicability 
of the models to other scenarios (fungal species, wood species) may not be appropriate. Furthermore, another 
failure mode for wood and moisture, is mold growth, which is initiated at lower moisture levels. An indication 
of risk of mold growth would indicate problems or risks before the initiation of wood rot. Mold growth does 
not deteriorate the wood, but is usually equally undesired due to health concerns of occupants. For this reason, 
there might be places where some mold growth would be acceptable, e.g. embedded beam ends if there is no 
transfer of air from the moldy area to the indoor air. Therefore, risk of rot could be important. The paper 
investigates models for mass loss due to wood decay and mold growth based on exposure time to favorable 
hygrothermal conditions. The investigation is based on inspection of wood samples (wall plates) from a full-
scale experimental setup of masonry with embedded wood and monitored conditions, to which the prediction 
models will be applied. Monitored hygrothermal conditions were implemented in mold and wood decay 
models, and samples were removed from the test setup. The implemented models yielded high mold index 
and mass loss, whereas neither mold nor decay was observed in the physical samples. Results indicate that 
the implemented models, in these cases appear to overestimate the risks of mold and rot in the supportive lath 
behind the insulation. 
1 Introduction  
In older masonry buildings, wood is often embedded in 
the walls as storey partitioning beams, supportive wall 
plates, or wooden frames in half-timbered masonry. Thus, 
the wooden elements can be significant load-bearing 
elements. Wood decaying fungi usually causes wood to 
lose strength, and change shape and color. A reduced 
strength and mass due to fungal attack can therefore have 
substantial consequences. Furthermore, the fungi may 
release unpleasant odors, and inhalation of airborne 
microorganisms and metabolites of some species may 
cause symptoms of respiratory problems for building 
occupants, depending on exposure and immunological 
reactivity [1]. Biological degradation of wood is a 
naturally occurring process of fungal growth given 
favorable conditions of both e.g., moisture and 
temperature. Most wood decaying fungi have optimum 
conditions at 20-30°C, and a wood moisture content of 20-
30 % (wt.). Wood-decaying fungi colonize in wood with 
a moisture content above 20 % (wt.) [1], and below 
70 % (wt.) [2]. Some species are able to decay wood at 
lower moisture levels than 20 % (wt.) and still other 
species prefer much higher moisture contents for optimal 
growth. There are more than 30 known wood decaying 
fungi species as may be found in buildings [3], and they 
have different preferences and optimal growth conditions. 
Some species can hibernate in dry periods, and the decay 
will once again initiate when moisture conditions allow it 
[4]. Some decay processes are very slow, and actual mass 
and strength loss can take years to develop [3]. Other 
fungi can cause serious damage within short time frames 
given optimal conditions. The optimal moisture 
conditions for fungal growth also depends on other 
factors, such as the time of wetness, temperature and the 
type and condition of the wood. Previously attacked wood 
is also more prone to new attacks. 
There are three types of rot fungi that initiate wood 
decay; brown rot, soft rot and white rot [5]. Brown rot is 
initiated earlier and develops faster when compared to the 
other types. Furthermore, brown rot causes higher mass and 
strength loss when compared to white and soft rot on 
southern pine sapwood [6]. The more aggressive behavior 
of brown rot has also been demonstrated by Brischke et al. 
especially in sap and non-colored heartwood of European 
larch, Douglas fir, scots pine and Norway spruce [7]. They 
also found, that some species, e.g. larch and pine, were 
more sensitive to decay fungi when compared to fir.

Models for prediction of wood decay have been 
developed to evaluate the risk of decay under given 
conditions in structures. Similarly, models have been 
developed for prediction of the risk of mold growth under 
dynamic temperature and relative humidity conditions, 
and for different material sensitivity classes.
In this paper, indicative experimental investigations and 
dynamic models for mass loss due to wood decay and mold 
growth based on exposure time to favorable hygrothermal 
conditions for the formation of wood rot are compared. The 
investigation is based on inspection of wood samples (wall 
plates) from a full-scale experimental setup of masonry 
with embedded wood and monitored hygrothermal 
conditions, to which the prediction models will be applied.
The paper first describes the two applied wood decay 
models and one mold model. Thereafter, the experimental 
setup is described, as well as the method for removal of 
wooden samples and measurements performed. The 
monitored conditions in the wall plates that were 
investigated are presented and discussed, as well as results 
using prediction models, monitored moisture content and 
observed decay and mold growth.
2 Methods
Both prediction models and experimental methods have 
been implemented in this study for comparison of the 
predicted and observed conditions of the wood. In-situ 
measurements of hygrothermal conditions in wall plates 
were implemented in prediction models for mold and 
decay, and using a destructive method, wood samples 
were removed from the test setup and studied with regard
to the predicted risks.
2.1 Prediction models
For evaluation of the risks of wood decay or mold growth, 
models for the prediction of risks have been implemented. 
The models are briefly described in the next sections. 
2.1.1 VTT wood decay model
The VTT wood decay model accounts for the period of 
time in which the hygrothermal conditions (temperature, 
T, and relative humidity, RH) are favorable with regard to 
wood decay [5]. The model generates a percentage of 
irreversible mass loss, ML [%], in the wood. The original 
model, described in equation 1, was developed for brown 
rot decay in sapwood under constant conditions with 
T≥0°C and RH≥95%. Under dynamic hygrothermal 
conditions, the mass loss is separated in two processes; 
the activation process and a mass loss process. The 
activation process is defined by α (equation 2-4) which is 
initially 0. When α reaches 1, the decay process is initiated 
and the mass loss is described in Equation 5;

2.1.2 Japanese wood decay model
Similarly to the VTT model, the Japanese model defines 
mass loss due to wood decay, based on hygrothermal 
conditions (T, RH), and exposure time [8,9]. The 
development of the Japanese wood decay model was 
based on rate constants determined by mass loss in small 
wood samples (Japanese red pine) with brown rot fungus.
In this model, mass loss initiates when the relative 
humidity exceeds 98%, which is defined as the critical 
relative humidity, RHcrit, as no mass loss was observed at
lower relative humidities. The Japanese model neglects 
the initial response time for delay, when conditions reach 
RHcrit. The mass loss due to wood decay is generated 
through equations 6-8, and output of the model is mass 
loss in kg/kg. The mass loss at surface points is found by 
equation 6, whilst the mass loss at inner points in a 
construction is defined by equation 7. The rate constant 
for mass loss, km [1/s], is found by equation 8.

2.1.3 VTT Mold model
The VTT mold model generates a mold index, M [-],
based on given boundary conditions of temperature and 
relative humidity, as well as considering the sensitivity 
class of the substrate. The mold index, M, is a number 
between 0 and 6 indicating the amount of mold growth to 
be expected under given conditions on the given substrate. 
The definitions of the various values for mold index are 
given in Table 1.

The model index is found by means of equation 9
below [10,11]. In this case, SQ (surface quality) was 0 for 
sawn surfaces, and W (wood species) was 0 for pine. The 
factors k1 and k2 are correction coefficients for mold
growth intensity and moderation of mold growth intensity 
as M approaches Mmax. The value of Mmax is the maximum 
mold index value achieved under the given conditions, 
and constant factors A, B and C are determined by k2 and 
the sensitivity class [10].

To take into account the decline of mold growth 
during unfavorable conditions, the extent of degradation 
of mold must also be considered. The reduction in value 
of mold index is defined as presented in equations 13
(mold decline intensity for pine) and 14 (mold decline 
intensity for any material given the recurrence coefficient 
Cmat). For this work, the material is classified as 
“sensitive”, corresponding to planed wood, paper-based 
products, and wood-based panels (e.g. planed pine, 
glulam). The recurrence coefficient Cmat, was set to 1, 
corresponding to untreated wood or pine.

2.2 Experimental investigations
2.2.1 Large scale experimental setup
A large-scale experimental setup at the Technical 
University of Denmark consisted
of 24 internally 
insulated solid masonry wall sections with embedded 
wooden beams and supportive wall plates (pine). A
section view of the wall configurations is given in Fig. 1;
red dots and numbers represent monitoring points for 
temperature and relative humidity (digital HYT 221 
sensors; ±1.8%RH (23°C ,0-90%RH)). The experimental 
setup was first and foremost conducted for evaluating the 
performance of several different internal insulation 
systems, which have been further described, analyzed and 
reported in [12–14]. For the present study, samples from 
the wooden supportive wall plate were taken from six of 
these walls. By means of sorption isotherms for pine [15],
the moisture content was determined. In this study, only 
results from measuring point no. 5, in the wall plate, have 
been included.
Four years of measurement data (5/1/2015-5/1/2019) 
from sensor location 5 (supportive wall plate) were 
studied, and the cases with highest relative humidity were 
implemented in the VTT wood decay model. Six walls 
showed very high wood decay according to the VTT 
model, and were chosen for further investigation. All of 
these walls were oriented towards the SW, and the wall 
configurations are elaborated in Table 2 with regard to 
insulation system, and internal and external surface 
treatments. The digital RH measurements for the wooden 
wall plates were used for both the wood decay models as 
well as the mold model.

2.2.2 Destructive investigation
To study the conditions of the wall plates, and indications 
of rot and mold, Ø80mm samples were extracted by cup-
drilling the construction from the inside after removal of 
the covering insulation and finishing. The samples were 
visually inspected and smelt for any odors to permit 
detecting signs of either rot or mold; the material 
resistance towards awl compression was also assessed.

A rule of thumb says, that if the awl penetrates 1-3mm, 
the wood is healthy. A 3-6mm penetration indicates that
the wood is very moist, and possibly attacked by wood 
rot. If the penetration depth of the awl exceeds 6mm, there 
is likely a comprehensive fungi attack [16].
The moisture content of the wood was measured with 
a pin gauge on the internal surface immediately after 
removal of covering insulation, and on the external 
surface after the sample was removed from the 
construction. Furthermore, the mass of each sample was 
registered directly after removal from the wall that 
thereafter, allowed determining the total moisture content 
in the sample. This was performed by weigh-dry-weigh 
method, where the specimens were dried at 105°C until 
constant mass.

Fig. 2. Process of removing samples from the supportive wall 
plate. Measurements of moisture content (a) and Mycometer 
swabs (d) were performed on both ends of the samples.
Finally, two Mycometer swab tests [17–19] were 
made on each end of the drilled-out sample. Mycometer 
(surface) is a method for detection and quantification of 
mold growth on surfaces. The method is based on 
fluorometric detection and quantification of an enzyme 
found in mold spores and the mycelium. The Mycometer 
test generates a number that indicates the density of fungal 
biomass on the surface, corresponding to one of the 
following categories; A: ≤25 (mold level is not above 
regular background level); B: 25-450 (mold level is above 
regular background level. This mold level can be caused 
by high concentrations in dust, or indicate the presence of 
dried-out mold), and; C: >450 (mold level is much higher 
than regular background level due to mold growth). The 
process of removing insulation, measuring moisture 
content, drilling the samples and Mycometer swabs, is 
illustrated in Fig. 2.
3 Results and discussion
The moisture content in the supportive wall plates over a 
4-year time period of this study, are depicted in Fig. 3. An 
average between adsorption and desorption has been used 
under the assumption of equilibrium to surrounding air. It 
is seen, that the moisture content has an upper limit in this 
case, due to the limits of the sorption isotherm as was 
implemented [15], however the magnitude of the values 
are compatible with on-site measurements (see Fig. 7). It 
is seen, that after the first year of measurements, all the 
wall plates exhibit moisture contents between 20 and 33
% (wt.) for the entire period. Wall plates G4, X2 and X8 
have few, shorter periods with moisture contents less than 
20 % (wt.). The conditions are thus above the threshold 
value for decay, and for this reason, these wall plates 
appear to be in high risk of occurrence of wood decaying 
fungi.

The monitored hygrothermal conditions for the six 
wall configurations presented in Table 2
were 
implemented in the wood decay models and the mold
model respectively. The progression in values of wood 
decay and mold index over the 4 years of measurement 
data, are presented in Fig. 4, Fig. 5 and Fig. 6.
In the VTT model, three of the wall configurations (G4, 
G5 and X1) exhibit mass loss above 120% before 4 years.
The remaining three wall configurations (X8, G1, X2) 
generated mass loss above 60% within 4 years. In terms of 
the Japanese model, the generated mass loss is less in terms 
of magnitude compared to the VTT model. The Japanese 
model yields mass loss above 60% in G4, G5 and X1. Wall 
X8 generated 40% mass loss in 4 years, whereas G1 and 
X2 resulted in around 20% mass loss. With regard to the 
value of the mold index, all the wall configurations show 
maximum value of mold index of 5.29 within 3 years. This 
is the maximum mold index value to be achieved for
sensitivity class 2. The worst cases (G4, G5, X1) yielded
the maximum value of mold index within the first year. 
Furthermore, it can be seen from the graphs of predicted 
wood decay and mold index (Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6), that 
the initiation of mold growth occurs prior to the initiation 
of wood decay, which was also found to be the case in 
[11].

2019. The in-situ measurements reported in Fig. 3 are
presented for up to 1st of May 2019, and show a clear 
general tendency of nadirs in the autumn seasons.

Fig. 7. Measurements of moisture content performed on site 
with pin gauge on internal and external surface, as well as the 
whole specimen
From the in-situ pin gauge measurements on the 
external surface of the sample, and the weigh-dry-weigh 
experiments on the samples, in Fig. 7 it is seen that the 
moisture content in the supportive wall plates is in the 
range of 20-27 % (wt.). The moisture content on the 
internal surface is recorded as lower in all cases. This 
observation is in line with the expected results: Due to the 
temperature gradient, the relative humidity on the exterior 
side of the construction is higher and therefore also the 
moisture content. The effect from external moisture loads 
(e.g. wind-driven rain) may also influence the conditions 
on the external side of the wall plates, as the masonry 
covering the wall plate is only one brick unit in depth 
(228mm). Furthermore, the anisotropic properties of 
wood promote moisture transport in the longitudinal 
direction and thus not tangentially through the wall plate. 
It is seen in Fig. 7, that samples from walls X2 and X8 
yield the lowest moisture contents, consistent with Fig. 3.
The measurements depicted in Fig. 3 also show, that G4 
declined in moisture content by the spring of 2019, 
however the measurements from October 2019 indicate 
that the moisture content has again increased. The 
procedure of drilling out the samples generated high 
temperatures, and this is why it can be assumed that the 
pin gauge measurements on the external surface, as well 
the weigh-dry-weigh measurements could be affected by
this process. The moisture content registered on the 
external surface, as well as for the entire sample (weigh-
dry-weigh), might therefore have been even higher 
without the generation of heat from drilling.
The state of the wooden core samples from the wall 
plates is seen in Fig. 8, as well as an example of the awl 
test. None of the wood samples exhibited any indication 
of mass loss nor rot or mold. Neither did the awl test,
visual inspection or smelling indicate anything other than 
sound and healthy wood. The discolorations seen in the 
wood samples, were due to the drilling procedure, and 
from the wall construction and adjacent materials.
Results from Mycometer (surface) measurements are 
displayed in
Table 3.
None of the Mycometer 
measurements exhibit results in category C, above 450, 
which would be a clear indication of severe mold growth. 
The calculations with the mold model were performed 
with measurements from the external surface of the wall 
plate. The mold model yielded high mold index for all the 
cases, but G4, G5 and X1 generated mold growth the 
fastest. Two of these, G5 and X1 show the lowest density 
of mold with regard to the Mycometer tests on the external 
surface. The highest mold density was found on the 
external surface of X2, which in the model was shown to 
be almost the last case to reach the maximum value of 
mold index.

Thus, it is seen, that prediction models for wood decay 
and mold growth, in this case, appear too conservative with 
regard to the actual state of the rot and mold, as the degree 
of deterioration and mold as the results obtained from the 
model appear to be exaggerated. The VTT wood decay 
model predicted 60-160% mass loss in all the cases, where 
no rot or decay was actually detected. The Japanese decay
model appears to be less conservative, however the model 
generated mass loss above 20% for all cases, while no 
mass loss was observed. The difference between the two 
models is first and foremost the threshold value for rot; the 
VTT model initiates decay at 95% relative humidity,

whereas the Japanese threshold for wood decay is 98% 
relative humidity. In addition, the mold model generated 
alarmingly high mold index in all the cases, corresponding 
to “plenty of growth on surface, >50% coverage (visual)”, 
whilst no significant mold growth was detected by the 
Mycometer surface experiments nor visual inspection. 
With regard to the six investigated samples, the 
hygrothermal performance can be ranked in the following 
sequence according to monitored conditions, see Fig. 3;
X2, G1, X8, X1, G4, and G5. The wood decay models 
yield very similar results with regard to the performance 
and mass loss achieved, which is not surprising as these
prediction models are based on the hygrothermal 
conditions provided. The mold model gave a mold index 
value above 5 for all the wall plates investigated, which 
were differentiated only by the time it took to reach the 
maximum value of mold index. 
The summation of Mycometer results on each wall 
plate, however, yielded a different sequence of optimal 
performance; G5, X8, X1, G4, G1, X2. The highest 
Mycometer numbers, were thus found in X2 (external 
side) and G1 (internal side), despite the fact that these wall 
plates exhibited the lowest moisture contents during in-situ 
measurements (Fig. 3), and as such, from the prediction 
results were the last to reach the maximum value of mold 
index. Thus, the Mycometer results were not consistent 
with the moisture content determinations and the predicted 
risks of neither wood decay nor mold growth. G1 yielded 
the highest Mycometer number on the internal surface, 
which may be partly explained by the fact that this 
insulation system is the only one represented without 
alkaline cementitious glue mortar, that can inhibit mold 
growth [20]. Furthermore, the quality, sawing and 
finishing of the wood may differ from wall to wall, which 
may also affect the results.
It should be noted, that the physical methods applied 
for detection of mould and/or decay (visual, odor, awl, 
mycometer) are indicative methods. This fact naturally 
reduces the reliability of the results, and may be cause of 
some discrepancies. However, the combined indicators all 
yield similar results. The moisture conditions in the 
supportive lath yield very high moisture content, and the
uncertainty in the monitoring equipment is only given for 
up to 90% RH. Therefore, the in-situ measurements 
themselves also carry uncertainties, that are included in the 
prediction models.
Furthermore, some of the
discrepancies can be 
explained by the fact that the mold model was developed 
for surface conditions, not built-in surfaces, for worst case 
(untreated pine sapwood) and based on small specimens 
with mainly constant climate conditions [11]. The updated 
mold model implemented in this study does allow better 
prediction by including the sensitivity classification, and 
mold condition states to yield reliable predictions of first 
biological growth at interfaces [10], however the results 
still appear too conservative. Some of the reasons provided 
for these discrepancies also apply to the VTT wood decay 
models, given that these were based on experiments under 
constant hygrothermal conditions for small samples of 
untreated pine sapwood [5], and on small samples of 
Japanese red pine for the Japanese model [8]. Despite the 
discrepancies found in this study, the models provide 
indications of potential risks of fungal attacks under the 
given hygrothermal conditions and exposure time. In this 
way, the models can be used to evaluate systems a
comparative basis and in relation to one another, and thus, 
permit establishing better or poorer performance.
Such 
results, however, could also be achieved by observation of 
the measured moisture contents alone.
4 Conclusions
From the present investigation it was found that:
 The wood decay models were too conservative in this 
case. The VTT model yielded 60-160% mass loss, and 
the Japanese model gave 20-70% mass loss in the wall 
plates, and none was detected by visual inspection and 
awl compression test.
 The mold model was too conservative as all the samples 
from the wall plates yielded predicted mold index values 
above 5, but no significant mold growth was detected on 
the samples by visual inspection nor Mycometer 
measurements.
 The presented models all appear to overestimate the 
potential risks of wood decay and mold growth 
respectively. The models can be used for comparison 
purposes of different solutions under given conditions. 
This may however also be evaluated from a review of 
results of moisture content alone. The models should be 
further developed to be applicable for evaluation of 
moisture safe construction assemblies.
 Mold growth is initiated prior to wood decay based on 
the same parameters of temperature, relative humidity 
and time; as such, mold (in most cases) could be a 
limiting factor with regard to “moisture safe” solutions 
in critical positions where the presence of mold is not 
acceptable.
 In cases where mold growth is not a threat for indoor air 
quality, e.g., built-in wood in constructions that do not 
have air transfer to indoors, wood decay would be the 
relevant failure mode.
 The initiation of mold growth in building construction 
always indicates the presence of excess moisture, which 
is an undesirable condition and likely caused by a
building defect or certainly an issue that should be 
addressed.
