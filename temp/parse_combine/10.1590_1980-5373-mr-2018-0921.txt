The influence of the Nb5+-doped content and the doping CaCO3 on the electrical properties and the 
microdefects of BSTN ceramics by Positron Annihilation Techniques were studied, which were fired 
at 1350 °C for 2 hours in air. The PTCR characteristics in the BSTN samples were also investigated. 
Moreover, the information on microdefects in BSTN ceramics was demonstrated by coincidence 
Doppler broadening spectrum measurements and positron annihilation lifetime spectra. Meanwhile, 
the influence of the defects on the electrical properties of the ceramics was also revealed. Furthermore, 
the critical donor-dopant content was 0.4 mol%, which corresponding room-temperature resistivity 
and the resistivity jumping ratio was 714.3 Ω·cm and 2.77 × 102, respectively. In addition, the average 
positrons annihilate lifetime τ of the BSTN ceramics was investigated as well.

1. Introduction
Barium titanate is a ferroelectric material, which 
transforms from a tetragonal perovskite structure (ABO3) 
into a paraelectric structure 1. The ions at the A or B site of 
BaTiO3 are replaced by small quantities of a trivalent donor 
or pentavalent impurities, respectively; BaTiO3 becomes a 
semiconducting material and exhibits the positive temperature 
coefficient of resistivity (PTCR) effect 2, 3. Heywang 4 
explained this phenomenon, and an improved discussion was 
later provided by Jonker 5.The PTCR characteristic of doped 
BaTiO3 ceramics is considered to a grain-boundary effect. 
An effective method is considered to detect defects in bulk 
by positron annihilation technology (PAT) 6, 7, which include 
the coincidence Doppler broadening spectrum (CDBS) and 
positron annihilation lifetime spectra (PALS). The momentum 
distribution of the annihilating e+–e′ pairs can be detected 
using the CDBS; meanwhile, the annihilation information of 
positrons can be offered by the PALS. Recently, Deng et al. 8 
suggested that the Nb addition was effective in enhancing the 
d–d interactions by Positron Annihilation Techniques (PAT). 
The defects of the ZnNb2−xTixO6−x ceramics could be also 
investigated by PAT 9. The PALS of TiAl alloys had been 
analyzed 10. In addition, a high amount of titanium vacancies 
could lead to grain-growth inhibition 11. The precipitation 
of a Ti-rich phase was due to a vacancy-compensation 
mechanism 12. Thus, the charge compensation was achieved 
by titanium vacancies and electrons 13.
However, little attention has been paid to the donor-
doped content on both the electrical properties and the 
microdefects of the BSTN ceramics. Previous studies 
have focused only on the chemical reaction of the samples. 
Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the 
effects of the donor-doped content and the doping CaCO3 
on the microdefects and the electrical properties of BSTN 
ceramics using the PAT.
2. Experimental Procedures
The starting materials were high-purity BaCO3 (>99.8%), 
SrCO3 (>99.8%), Nb2O5 (>99.99%), TiO2 (>99.8%), Al2O3 
(>99.8%), and SiO2 (>99.99%), and they were weighed on 
the basis of the following formula: (Ba0.95Sr0.05)(TiNbx)O3 + 
Mn(NO3)2 + 0.25 mol% (4Al2O3 : 9SiO2 : 3TiO2) (BSTN), 
In our work, the samples doped with 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 
mol% Nb5+ were represented as SP1, SP2, SP3 and SP4; 
Moreover, the SP3 ceramics of doping CaCO3 with 4 mol% 
and 8 mol% were replaced by SP5 and SP6, respectively. The 
mixture was mixed by wet ball milling for 8 h in deionized 
water using an agate ball in a polyurethane jar, and they 
were dried at 115 °C in drying oven, then the powders were 
calcined at 1190 ºC for 3 h in air. The mixture was ground 
again through ball-milling for 8 h. The dried powders were 
mixed with PVA and compacted by pressing at 150MPa to 
prepare the green compacts (φ15mm × 3mm size). The blocks 
were sintered in an aluminum tube at 1350 ºC for 2 h in air.

Materials Research
Moreover, the surfaces of the fired BSTN ceramics were 
coated Ag-Zn alloy and then sintered at 540 °C for 10 min 
in order to form electrodes, thereafter the room-temperature 
(RT) resistance of the specimens was measured using a digital 
multimeter, and the temperature dependence of resistance 
was measured in a temperature-programmable furnace at 
a heating rate of 1.6 ºC/min in the range of 25–300 ºC. In 
addition, the surface microstructure of the sintered ceramics 
was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM; 
S-3400N Hitachi, Japan). The average grain size of the 
ceramics was estimated by the line-intersection method.
The PALS were carried out at room temperature using a fast–
fast coincidence ORTEC system with a time resolution of 240 
ps (full width at half maximum, FWHM). A 3.7×105 Bq source 
of 22Na was sandwiched between two sheets of the samples 10.
The CDBS were measured by sandwiching a 0.6 MBq 22Na 
radioactive source, supported by two kapton films, between 
two pieces of the same sample. The CDBS were carried out 
by a two-detector coincidence system. A high purity Ge 
(HPGe) detector with a resolution of 1.3 keV at 511 KeV was 
determined to be the main detector. A NaI(Tl) scintillator was 
decided to the auxiliary detector supplying the coincidence 
signal, which was located in collinear geometry with the Ge 
detector for detecting the two 511 keV γ rays from the e+−e- 
annihilation pair. A peak with about 107 counts to background 
ratio of approximate 1.5 × 104 on the high-energy side 
of the peak could be obtained in the peak of each spectrum. 
The CDBS of signal crystals of Si, and BSTN ceramics have 
been measured.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Microstructure of the ceramics
The microstructure of the BSTN ceramics with doping 
CaCO3 of different contents sintered at 1350 °C for 2 h in 
air is shown in Fig. 1. A slight difference in the grain size is 
observed. The average grain sizes of the samples doped Ca2+ of 
0–8 mol% are 6.88 µm, 4.47 µm, and 2.80 µm, respectively. It 
indicates that the grain size of the specimens decreases quickly 
with an increase of the concentration of CaCO3; Moreover, the 
grain size of the SP6 samples becomes very uniform in Fig.1 
(c), probably due to the inhibition of the grain growth with an 
increase in the CaCO3 content. Thus, the particle-size distribution 
may be due to differences in the rates of grain growth.
3.2. XRD analysis
The XRD patterns of the BSTN ceramics prepared by 
firing at 1350 °C for 2 h are shown in Fig. 2. The diffraction 
peaks of the samples exhibit a tetragonal structure in which 
the reflections (002) and (200) can be split into two peaks at 
room temperature. Moreover, the peak position where (111) is 
shifted to higher 2θ with the increase of Ca2+ may be due to the 
smaller interplanar distance, as calculated by the Bragg equation.

Annihilation Techniques
3.3. Electrical properties and the resistivity jumping 
ratio of the BSTN ceramics
The dependence of the RT resistivity and the resistivity 
jumping ratio (ρmax/ρmin) of the BSTN ceramics on the 
dopant content is shown in Table 1. From the table, the RT 
resistivity can be found to decrease firstly and then increase 
with an increase in the content of doping Nb5+ of 0.2−0.5 
mol%; however, the trend of the resistivity jumping ratio as 
a function of the dopant concentration is contrary to that of the 
RT resistivity. The results show that the critical donor-dopant 
content is 0.4 mol% Nb5+. The corresponding RT resistivity 
and the resistivity jumping ratio is 714.3 Ω·cm and 2.77×102. 
The phenomenon signifies that the decrease in resistivity is 
due to the electron compensation of the substitution of Ti4+ 
by Nb5+ 13, 14. However, the increase in resistivity is generally 
attributed to the ionic compensation resulting from the 
formation of cation vacancies 15-17. In addition, we can see 
that the higher the doping Ca2+ content, the higher is the RT 
resistivity as well. This is because the doping CaCO3 may 
be beneficial to the grain refinement in BSTN ceramics. But 
the resistivity jumping ratios of the SP5 and SP6 samples are 
far lower than that of the SP3. Furthermore, the temperature 
coefficient of resistance (αT) of the BSTN samples is nearly 
affected by the dopant content in Table 1.
3.4. Parameters of PALS of the BSTN ceramics
The defects in the BSTN samples can be characterized 
by the PALS. The spectra of the ceramics are analyzed by 
three decay lifetime (τ1,τ2 and τ3) and the corresponding 
intensities (I
’
1, I
’
2 and I
’
3) 18 after background subtractions 
and source corrections. The τ3 in each sample has long decay 
lifetime (> 1844 ps) and a small intensity I
’
3 (< 1%). This is 
because that the positrons are annihilated at the surface of 
samples, so it can be not considered in our experiment. Thus, 
the total intensities of I
’
1 and I
’
2 must be re-normalized and 
be labeled as I1 and I2, respectively. The τ2 is the annihilated 
lifetime of the positron at the defect, its corresponding 
annihilated rate λd = τ2
-1. On the base of the standard two-
state trapping model 19, the positron annihilated rate λb 
and lifetime τb in the bulk are calculated for the following 
formula, λb = I1τ1
-1 + I2τ2
-1 and τb = λb
-1, respectively. While 
the average lifetime τ is based on the following equation, 
τ = I1τ1 + I2τ2. Finally, the electron densities in defects 
and bulk, nd and nb, can be be expressed as the following 
formula 20: n = (τ-2) / 134, respectively. The characteristic 
parameters of the positron annihilate lifetime of the BSTN 
ceramics are shown in Table 2. Moreover, Fig. 3 shows 
that the dependent of the τ and nb of the ceramics in Table 
2 on the Nb5+-doped content.

The mean positron annihilate lifetime τ increases firstly 
and then decreases with the increasing of the donor-doped 
concentration; however, the change trend of the electron 
densities in bulk nb is just contrary to that of the τ in 
Fig. 3. Furthermore, it is found that the τ (206.46 ps) of 
the SP2 samples is minimum, this is because that the nb 
(2.26 × 10-2 a.u.) in the SP2 bulk is maximum at the same 
time. In addition, the electronic configuration of Nb and 
Ti are 4d4 5s1 and 3d2 4s2, respectively. The d electron 
of Nb is more than that of Ti. Moreover, the electronic 
energy level of Nb (4d) is also higher than that of the Ti 
(3d). The conductivity characteristics are considered by 
electron compensation when the Ti in the BSTN ceramics 
(0.2 mol% < x < 0.3 mol%) is substituted by Nb. The 
results have been proved by the experimental data of the 
τ. But an increase in the τ is attributed to the vacancies 
compensation mechanism.
3.5. CDBS analysis of the BSTN samples
The background of the Doppler broadening spectrum 
can be reduced by the coincidence technique. In view of 
the constituent of the longitudinal horizontal momentum PL 
of the annihilation e+−e- pair the 511 keV site is broadened 
into (511 + ∆Ε) keV site. Moreover, the PL is given by the 
expression: PL = 2 ∆Ε / c, where ∆Ε is the frequency shift, 
and c is the velocity of light. In order to convenient for 
identifying various spectral lines, the ratio curves can be 
obtained by the comparison of every spectral line and the 
standard spectrum of Si.
The ratio curves for the SP1−SP6 samples with doping 
different dopant which are sintered at 1350 °C in air is shown 
as in Fig. 4. The constituent of the longitudinal momentum 
PL of the annihilation e+−e- pair in 10-3 m0c is regarded as 
X-axis. The detailed shape of the high-momentum part of 
the Doppler spectrum is determined by the different effects 
from the positron annihilation with the electrons of each 
shell of the atom.

It is showed that the main peak of the ratio curves of 
the BSTN samples cooled at 1100 °C for 2 h after firing at 
1350 °C for 2 h in air increases at first and then decreases 
with the increasing of the donor-doped content in the Fig. 4.

Investigation on Electrical Properties and Microdefects of Nb5+-Doped BaTiO3 Based Ceramics by Positron 
Annihilation Techniques
The Nb and Ti ratio curves show a peak at about 10.85 × 
10−3 m0c in Fig. 3(a); the intensities of the pecks are 4.28 
and 2.79, respectively. These peaks are due to the positron 
annihilation with d electrons 8, 21. Furthermore, the peaks of 
each BSTN samples lie between 2.79−4.28. The increase 
in the peak is because that the Ti is substituted by Nb. It is 
indicated that the annihilation of the e+-e- pair is related to 
the donor-doped concentration. The intensities of the peck 
near 11.84 × 10-3 m0c for the SP3 specimens are more than 
that of the other samples; Moreover, the intensities of the 
maximum peak of the ceramics is 4.07. The formation of 
the peck at about 11.84 × 10-3 m0c is generally attributed 
to the annihilation of positrons and 2p electrons of oxygen 
atoms. It is inferred that the difference of the peak position 
of the samples with doping the same dopant is due to the 
annihilation of positron and 3d electrons of the cations, 
which can be obtained by the formation of the defect in the 
BSTN ceramics. Especially, lots of the titanium vacancies 
in the BSTN samples can be formed. Moreover, the bigger 
the content of the cation vacancies, the higher is the peak 
of the annihilation of positron with 3d electrons.
4. Conclusions
The influence of the Nb5+-doped content and the CaCO3 
on the electrical properties and the microdeffect of the BSTN 
ceramics were investigated by PALS and DSMB Techniques, 
which were fired at 1350 °C for 2 h in air. The results indicated 
that the donor-doped content affected the formation of the 
microdefects and the electrical properties of the BSTN specimens. 
Moreover, both the RT resistivity and the positron annihibition 
lifetime τ of the BSTN ceramics decreased firstly and then 
increased with the increasing of the Nb5+-doped content. The 
critical donor-doped content is 0.4 mol%, which corresponding 
average positrons annihilate lifetime τ is 208.68 ps. meanwhile, 
It is found that the major peak of the ratio curves of the SP3 
sample is lie in about 11.84 × 10-3 m0c.
