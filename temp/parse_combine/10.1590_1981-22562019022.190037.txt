Oxidative stress among informal caregivers
Keywords: Caregivers. 
Oxidative Stress. Quality of 
Life. Anxiety.
Abstract
Objective: to evaluate oxidative stress and non-enzymatic antioxidant defenses in informal 
caregivers, and correlations with anxiety, health satisfaction and quality of life. Method: a 
case-control analytical study was performed, where the case was represented by the main 
informal caregiver and the control was paired with individuals with identical characteristics 
to the case, but who were not informal caregivers. The following instruments were used: 
a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Beck anxiety scale and the WHOQoL-Bref. 
Oxidative stress was measured through blood by analysis of the Ferric Reducing Ability 
of Plasma (FRAP) and Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances (TBARS) markets. 
Results: most informal caregivers were females. There was no difference in the degree of 
anxiety between the Case and Control groups. Among informal caregivers, 9.4% said they 
were very dissatisfied and 53.1% dissatisfied with their health. Most caregivers (43.8%) 
rated their quality of life as poor and 12.5% ​as very poor, while most controls rated it as 
good (68.8%). The TBARS and FRAP values ​were lower in the Case group than in the 
Control group. Conclusion: The informal caregivers, who were mostly women, defined 
themselves as dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with their health. Nevertheless, they did

Oxidative stress among caregivers
Rev. Bras. Geriatr. Gerontol. 2019;22(4):e190037
INTRODUCTION
Free radicals are continuously formed in the 
human body as a result of aerobic metabolism or 
by the action of enzymatic systems such as NAD(P)
H oxidases, catalases and nitric oxide synthases. In 
small concentrations these substances, play important 
physiological roles in intracellular and intercellular 
signaling and hormone production.  
However, when the production of free radicals 
exceeds the capacity of antioxidant systems, a 
pathophysiological condition called oxidative 
stress occurs. So that free radical concentrations 
do not become elevated, the human body possesses 
enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant systems 
capable of eliminating them1-4. These mechanisms 
are important since excess free radicals react with 
proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and DNA, leading 
to many diseases prevalent in aging5. The products 
generated by the reaction of free radicals with these 
cellular constituents, including lipoperoxides, are 
considered important biomarkers of oxidative 
stress6. The redox balance can also be estimated by 
determining the ability of the plasma to reduce ferric 
ion, which reflects the action of the non-enzymatic 
antioxidant defenses present in this biological fluid7. 
Oxidative stress can be aggravated by exposure 
to environmental agents such as pollution and 
cigarette smoke which contain free radicals, or by 
the consumption of alcohol and drugs that increase 
the endogenous production of these substances8,9. 
Sedentary individuals are more likely to have higher 
levels of oxidative stress, as they do not properly 
develop their antioxidant defenses4. Oxidative stress 
is also higher in individuals subjected to mental 
stress and psychiatric illness, although the causal 
relationship between these pathophysiological 
conditions is still poorly known9. Thus, the mitigation 
of oxidative stress involves a balanced diet, physical 
activity, reduced alcohol and tobacco consumption, 
reduced mental stress, and improved environmental 
conditions.
Informal caregivers, as they dedicate themselves 
exclusively to others, can experience significant 
changes in their lifestyle and habits. Thus, they 
may neglect their diet or daily practice of physical 
activity and, therefore, may present a higher degree 
of oxidative stress. Informal caregivers may also 
have a higher degree of mental stress and anxiety. In 
fact, it is estimated that around 90% of the world’s 
population may be affected by mental stress, which 
may be considered the most worrying factor of the 
modern age10. 
Situations that threaten the physical and emotional 
security of the individual, in the short and long term, 
involving their reputation and self-esteem, are among 
the factors that most trigger stress situations11. In this 
sense, some scales are useful, such as the Beck anxiety 
scale12 and the WHO (World Health Organization) 
quality of life scale13 to investigate stress in day to 
day life14.
With population aging, there is a tendency for the 
number of older adults to depend partially or totally 
on care. It is increasingly common for someone 
to take on the role of informal caregiver of such 
older people, usually a family member. This leads 
to changes or redefinitions of the roles of one or 
more family members. These caregivers assume the 
responsibility of caring, most often without technical 
preparation, for up to 24 hours a day. Thus, the 
caregiver “gives up most of their daily life, mainly 
abdicating leisure and paid work, which significantly 
changes their life dynamics and the dynamics of 
family life”14.
The act of caring represents a challenge to 
the caregiver, as it causes physical and emotional 
exhaustion and overload, as well as financial costs, 
added to the risks of mental and physical illness. Caring 
is an act of bondage because the caregiver offers the 
best of his or her talents to others15.  Caregivers 
commonly manifest extreme tiredness; general 
fatigue; pains; physical and emotional exhaustion 
and overload; loss of resistance; nervousness; 
not manifest a higher degree of anxiety in comparison with the control population. 
In addition, they presented a lower degree of oxidative stress than the non-caregiving 
participants, perhaps due to a greater mobilization of the non-enzymatic antioxidant 
defenses present in the body.

irritability; anxiety; insomnia; depression, among 
other symptoms. This indicates that, in most cases, 
caring for others implies neglecting oneself, which 
directly impacts the caregiver’s quality of life16,17. 
The informal caregiver is one who cares 
voluntarily, usually represented by a family member, 
and may also be a friend or neighbor18. In Brazil, it 
is more common for the family to assume the role 
of caring19. Caring for an older family member is a 
subjective experience. Daily care becomes a challenge 
where, suddenly and often without knowledge and/
or support, this family member now takes on a new 
role, becoming a caregiver20. 
In this context, a new sphere to be encompassed 
by health services has emerged: home care. This is 
because families increasingly need to play the role 
of caregivers, both in order to maintain a sick family 
member or older adult in the family environment and 
to better manage resources that are often limited and 
prevent the hiring of a professional care provider21. 
In this sense, the aim of the present study was 
to evaluate oxidative stress and non-enzymatic 
antioxidant defenses in informal caregivers, 
comparing the data obtained with non-caregivers, 
and correlating the results with degree of anxiety, 
health satisfaction and quality of life.
METHOD
A case-control analytical study was performed, 
where the cases were represented by primary informal 
caregivers, matched with individuals with identical 
gender and age characteristics who were not informal 
caregivers as controls. 
The study was conducted in partnership with the 
Interdisciplinary Home Hospitalization Program 
(or PROIID) of the city of Marília, in the state 
of São Paulo, Brazil. This program accompanies 
patients and family members who, although they 
no longer need intensive in-hospital care, require 
care and guidance to improve their health-disease 
process, as well as restore their physical, emotional 
and mental integrity. The program is a partnership 
between the Clinical Hospital and the Municipal 
Health Department.
Informal caregivers who performed this role fully 
for six months or more, referred to as “cases”, were 
included in the study. These caregivers were selected 
through direct contact between the principal researcher 
and the relevant PROIID nurse. In this contact, the 
users of the program who were dependent on care were 
identified, with the subsequent need for an informal 
caregiver for a minimum of 12 hours per day, referred 
to in literature as a primary caregiver. These were 
selected after consulting the PROIID database. For 
the control, pairs with the same characteristics, such 
as age and gender, but who did not currently perform 
the role of caregiver, or who had not performed it 
for at least one year, were selected. The cases and 
the controls were matched one to one. All subjects 
involved in the study were over 18 years of age. 
Individuals who agreed to participate were 
initially asked if they had been diagnosed with 
systemic arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and 
dyslipidemia, as well as whether they were smokers 
or alcoholics. Active smokers and alcoholics were 
excluded from both groups due to the recognized 
influence of these factors on the oxidative stress 
assessment parameters used. Survey participants were 
advised not to consume processed foods and not to 
drink alcohol for three days prior to blood collection. 
The data was collected from July to November 
2018, exclusively by the principal researcher. The Beck 
anxiety scale12 and the World Health Organization 
Quality of Life Questionnaire (WHOQOL-bref) 
were applied13. 
The Beck’s anxiety scale consists of 21 multiple 
choice questions and measures the individual’s degree 
of anxiety, which may be mild, moderate or severe. 
It provides a score ranging from 0 to 63, with the 
degree of anxiety is proportional to the score12. The 
WHOQOL-bref, meanwhile, is a WHO-validated 
instrument to measure quality of life, divided into 
domains, namely: physical, psychological, social 
relations and environment22. Both instruments were 
applied individually.
Next, blood samples were collected from the 
participants to obtain plasma. These collections 
were made in the morning, between 8 am and 10 
am. Blood samples were collected in an EDTA tube 
and refrigerated at the Pharmacology Laboratory of 
4 of 9

the Marilia Medical School (Famema) within one 
hour. In the laboratory, the samples were centrifuged 
for 10 minutes at 4ºC, with rotation of 3000 rpm 
in a Hermle centrifuge. After centrifugation, the 
plasma was collected by pipette and transferred to 
another tube, where it was stored at -80ºC for further 
analysis of plasma lipoperoxide concentration by the 
Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances (TBARS)6 
technique. These samples were also used to determine 
the ability of plasma to reduce ferric ion by the Ferric-
Reducing Ability of Plasma (FRAP) technique7.
Sample size calculation was performed using the 
G*Power software program, version 3.1.9.2 (Franz 
Faul, Universität Kiel, Germany) to analyze oxidative 
stress in a case-control study using the Student t-test 
for independent samples. 
Data normality distribution was verified by 
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. For comparison 
between two independent groups, the Student’s 
t-test for unpaired samples or the nonparametric 
Mann-Whitney test were performed. To analyze 
the frequency distribution between the categories 
of qualitative variables, the Chi-square test for 
proportion was used. To analyze the relationship 
between two qualitative variables, the Chi-square 
test for proportion was applied. For all analyzes the 
SPSS software version 19.0 for windows was used, 
adopting a significance level of 5%.
The study was submitted to the Famema Research 
Ethics Committee, and was approved on December 
14, 2017, under Opinion No. 2,439,044. Participants 
signed a Free and Informed Consent Form (FICF) to 
participate in this study, in compliance with National 
Health Council Resolution No. 466/2012.
RESULTS
There was no initial significant difference 
between the case and control groups regarding the 
distribution of the variables gender, diabetes mellitus, 
dyslipidemia, systemic arterial hypertension, age

The group of caregivers was made up of family 
members, predominantly female, especially daughters 
and wives (Table 2). For each participant in the 
case group, there was a same-sex participant, not 
belonging to the same family, in the control group. 
The data obtained also show that there was no 
statistical difference in the degree of anxiety between 
individuals who performed the informal caregiver role 
and those who did not. Most individuals in the case 
group had minimal anxiety in comparison with control. 
Regarding satisfaction with health, no individual in 
the control group expressed dissatisfaction, while 9.4% 
of informal caregivers expressed such an opinion by 
answering the specific health-related question in the 
WHOQOL-bref. The alarming fact about this issue 
is that most caregivers, i.e. 17 (53.1%) participants, 
were dissatisfied with their health. Most caregivers 
(43.8%) rated their quality of life as poor, while most 
controls (68.8%) rated it as good (Table 3).

The data obtained also showed differences

Participants in the case group were found to have 
lower TBARS values compared to those in the 
control group. In contrast, FRAP values were lower 
in the case group than in the control group (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
In the present study, it was observed that due 
to performing the role of informal caregiver, 
the population included in the case group was 
predominantly composed of women, all of whom 
are family members of the care recipient23,24. These 
data are in line with literature that indicates that 
women predominantly assume the role of caregiver 
throughout the world, reflecting a culture rooted in 
the idea that caring is part of the female reality25. 
It should be considered that the caregiver is the 
main target of family tension caused by the stress 
and tiredness involved in care. Thus, due to the 
global increase in life expectancy, families must be 
socially and economically prepared to understand 
and support the role of the informal caregiver26. 
These caregivers, predominantly women, are also 
responsible for the link between the health team 
and the patient27, and are thus an essential figure 
for the success of home care. 
During data collection, it was common for the 
participant caregivers to report disturbed sleep 
patterns, as they often needed to wake up several 
times during the night to check the condition of 
the individual under their care (unquantified data). 
These caregivers complained that this compromised 
their daily activities. Another problem is a sedentary 
lifestyle, which was frequently found among the 
participants in both the case and control groups. 
In addition, there was a frequent complaint 
among informal caregivers about a lack of leisure 
opportunities, as they had no one to leave the care-
dependent family member with during the time 
spent on this purpose.
Another highly relevant factor, related to the 
link between women and the work of informal 
caregivers, is the misunderstanding, on the part of 
society in general, that caring is female in nature. 
In fact, care-related work represents an imposition 
on women. This understanding stems from the 
historic organization of the family in Brazil and in 
other countries, in which women were given all the 
domestic responsibilities, including looking after 
the recipient of care. According to Guedes24, during 
their productive lives, women are more likely to give 
up their careers, including because of maternity 
care. Thus, this removal from the labor market is 
prolonged through the continuation of the role of 
caregiver for a family member. In addition, the labor 
laws in force in Brazil, with inflexible hours that 
do not consider double shifts, make it difficult to 
reinsert these caregivers in the labor market after the 
period dedicated to care, leading them unemployed.
Several instruments aimed at assessing quality of 
life have been described and validated in literature, of 
which the WHOQOL-bref, used in the present study, 
is one of the most important. In the data collected 
by this instrument lower scores were identified in 
the psychological and interpersonal relationships domains, 
which are indicated in literature as being some of 
the main burdens of performing the role of informal 
caregiver. Caring results in physical, psychological 
and social burden. This is not only due to caregiving, 
which is important in itself, but is aggravated by the 
7 of 9
Oxidative stress among caregivers
Rev. Bras. Geriatr. Gerontol. 2019;22(4):e190037
fact that the caregivers, mostly women, accumulate 
extra duties related to household chores. This further 
increases the physical and social burden of the 
informal caregiver28.
It is noteworthy that about 10% of caregivers 
surveyed said they were very dissatisfied with their 
health and more than half said they were dissatisfied. 
These data are reinforced by a previous study in 
which a direct relationship was detected between 
negative self-rated health and increased burden 
imposed by the act of caring, as well as reduced 
happiness perceived by the caregiver29. Other authors 
have also observed an association between self-rated 
health and well-being26,30. According to these authors, 
health is a multidimensional factor and psychological 
well-being can influence it. This proposition is based 
on the WHO concept that health does not only 
involve the absence of disease, but is the result of the 
sum of physical, psychological and social well-being. 
In addition, in this study, health-related quality of life 
was a predictive factor for increased psychological 
well-being.
Regarding the self-assessment of overall quality 
of life, it is noteworthy that 43.8% of caregivers 
rated their quality of life as poor and 12.5% said 
it was very poor. Factors related to burden in care 
work and health conditions are those that most 
significantly affect the self-assessment of quality of 
life of caregivers. 
When assessing the TBARS of informal caregivers, 
a somewhat unexpected panorama was observed. This 
is because, despite declaring themselves dissatisfied 
with their health and classifying their quality of life 
as poor, informal caregivers had lower TBARS values 
than those observed in the control group. As already 
mentioned, TBARS is a parameter that indicates 
the degree of oxidative stress, as it quantifies the 
lipoperoxidation end products6. Thus, it can be said 
that despite the life and health conditions to which 
informal caregivers are subjected, they present a 
lower degree of oxidative stress. In this sense, it 
should be emphasized that chronic oxidative stress 
may be the genesis of several highly prevalent and 
often severe chronic degenerative diseases2,8. Indeed, 
these data are somewhat reassuring, as they suggest 
that the risk of illness in these caregivers surveyed 
is not elevated by oxidative stress. 
These data, however, reveal the complexity of 
oxidative balance in humans and the challenge of 
studying it in such a dynamic condition as the daily 
life of an informal caregiver. If on the one hand 
informal caregivers are dissatisfied with their health 
and realize that their quality of life is inadequate, on 
the other hand they may be less exposed to several 
factors that are highly pro-oxidative. To illustrate this 
reality, it is worth noting that informal caregivers 
also did not exhibit a higher degree of anxiety than 
the control group. This is not to say that the living 
conditions of an informal caregiver are unhealthy, 
but does warn of the possible existence of other 
factors that can mitigate oxidative stress in these 
individuals. Identifying these factors and how they 
relate to oxidative balance is a challenge that emerged 
from the present study.  
In this sense, it is worth noting that the difference 
in the degree of stress observed between the case 
and control groups is unlikely to be related to the 
prevalence of diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia and 
systemic arterial hypertension in the groups. This is 
because, although these diseases are closely related to 
oxidative stress31,32, there were no differences in the 
prevalence of the same between the case and control 
groups. There were also no differences between the 
groups regarding age and physical inactivity, factors 
that are also known to aggravate oxidative stress2,31. 
As mentioned, oxidative stress is a result of 
the imbalance between oxidant production and 
antioxidant defenses. This imbalance can result, 
on the one hand, from the excessive production of 
free radicals and/or the high uptake of free radicals 
from the environment, and, on the other, from a 
lower ability to eradicate the same by the antioxidant 
defenses present in the body2. Thus, when assessing 
oxidative stress, special attention should be paid 
to the body’s antioxidant defenses. In this sense, 
the present study also evaluated the capacity of the 
non-enzymatic antioxidant defenses present in the 
plasma of the individuals studied, using the FRAP 
technique. In fact, the antioxidant capacity measured 
by FRAP reflects the sum of the antioxidant actions 
of various components of biological fluids, including 
uric acid and ascorbic acid, which exert approximately 
60% and 20% of the evaluated antioxidant capacity, 
respectively. FRAP also influences the presence

Oxidative stress among caregivers

of vitamin E, bilirubin and albumin7. Given these 
considerations, the importance of a balanced diet for 
the proper functioning of these antioxidant defenses 
present in plasma is evident. It is interesting to note 
that the informal caregivers had reduced FRAP 
values, in comparison with the control group. This 
indicates that, in these individuals, the reduction 
of oxidative stress, characterized by the reduction 
in TBARS values, may have occurred due to the 
higher consumption of non-enzymatic antioxidant 
defenses, as measured by FRAP. However, why this 
mobilization of antioxidant defenses is greater in 
informal caregivers, to the point of perhaps reducing 
the degree of oxidative stress in these individuals, 
remains unknown.
CONCLUSION
Based on the data of the present study, it can 
be concluded that the informal caregivers were 
predominantly women from the family circle of 
the individual under care. This is explained by a 
culture that is rooted in the idea that caring is part 
of the female reality. These caregivers mostly define 
themselves as dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with 
their health, and more than half of them rate their 
quality of life as poor or very poor. Nevertheless, 
these caregivers did not show a higher degree of 
anxiety in relation to the population that did not 
perform care-related tasks. 
Finally, the informal caregivers exhibited a lower 
degree of oxidative stress than the non-caregivers, 
perhaps due to the greater mobilization of non-
enzymatic antioxidant defenses present in the body. 
These data suggest that the risk of illness among these 
caregivers due to oxidative stress does not appear to 
be high. This is not to say that the living conditions 
of informal caregivers are unhealthy, but does warn 
of the possible existence of other factors that may 
mitigate oxidative stress in these individuals.
