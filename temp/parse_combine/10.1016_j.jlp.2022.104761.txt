Abused and defective Li-ion cells can cause a catastrophic failure of a Li-ion battery (LIB), leading to severe fires 
and explosions. In recent years, several numerical and experimental studies have been conducted on the ex­
plosion hazard related to the vented combustible gases from failed Li-ion cells. Experimentally quantifying 
fundamental properties for failing LIBs is essential for understanding safety issues; however, it can be costly, 
time-consuming, and can be partly incomplete. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations have been an 
essential tool for studying the risk and consequences in the process industry. In this study, the prediction ac­
curacy of the open-source CFD combustion model/solver XiFoam was evaluated by comparing numerical sim­
ulations and experiments of premixed gas explosions in a 1-m explosion channel partly filled with 18650 cell-like 
cylinders. The prediction accuracy was determined by calculating the mean geometric bias and variance for the 
temporal pressure evolution, maximum pressure peak, positive impulse, spatial flame front velocity for two 
different channel geometries, in addition to two gas compositions at several fuel-air equivalence ratios. From this 
method, the XiFoam model/solver gave an overall acceptable model performance for both geometries and gas 
composition.   
1. Introduction 
Over the last decade, several fires and explosions have been caused 
by failing Li-ion batteries (LIBs). For example, in Texas, USA, in April 
2017, a train car carrying discarded LIBs for recycling caused an ex­
plosion, which shattered windows 350 feet from the incident (Sophia 
Beausoleil, 2017). In April 2019, a Li-ion battery energy storage system 
(BESS) caught fire in Arizona, USA. Three hours after the fire suppres­
sant had extinguished the fire, firefighters entered the BESS, shortly 
after that, an explosion occurred. The BESS was severely damaged, and 
several firefighters were injured (Hill, 2020). Similarly, in September 
2020, there was a fire in a 20 MWh BESS in Liverpool, UK. The BESS was 
already well alight when the firefighters arrived, and residents in the 
vicinity reported hearing an explosion (Andy Colthorpe, 2020; Ben 
Turner, 2020). In April 2021, a fire occurred in a solar panel installation 
with 25 MWh of lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) LIB on the rooftop of a 
shopping mall in Beijing, China. While the firefighters tried to extinguish 
the fire, an explosion occurred. The explosion led to the death of two 
firefighters. Due to limiting accidental information, the definite cause of 
the explosion is not known (CTIF - International Association of Fire and 
Rescue Services, 2021). 
If Li-ion cells are over-charged, over-discharged, short-circuited, 
deformed, punctured, or exposed to heat, there is a possibility for a 
catastrophic failure (Lian et al., 2019; Mikolajczak et al., 2011; Wang 
et al., 2019). A failing LIB can release gases such as hydrogen (H2), 
carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), electro­
lyte solvents, and toxic species (Fernandes et al., 2018; Golubkov et al., 
2014, 2015; Lammer et al., 2017; Nedjalkov et al., 2016; Roth et al., 
2004; Somandepalli et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2019). When combustible 
gases mix with air, they can cause explosions and fires (Bjerketvedt 
et al., 1997). 
In recent years, researchers have experimentally and numerically 
investigated the explosion hazard abused LIBs pose by determining the 
released gas composition, gas release rates, and combustion properties 
of the gas vented (Wang et al., 2019; Fernandes et al., 2018; Johnsplass 
et al., 2017; Henriksen et al., 2019, 2020; Baird et al., 2020; M. Hen­
riksen et al., 2021; Kennedy et al., 2021). Fernandes et al. (2018) 
determined the gas composition and total amount of released gas from 
commercial Li-ion cells abused by overcharge. The study showed that 
the abused cells mainly released electrolyte solvent, along with

hydrogen and other hydrocarbons. Henriksen et al. (Henriksen et al., 
2019, 2020) experimentally determined the explosion characteristics of 
several Li-ion electrolyte solvents and the laminar burning velocity 
(LBV) for the solvent dimethyl carbonate (DMC). The Li-ion electrolyte 
solvents had similar explosion characteristics as propane, whereas DMC 
had a slightly lower LBV than propane. 
Moreover, Baird et al. (2020) numerically estimated the lower 
explosive limit, explosion pressure, rate of explosion pressure rise, and 
the LBV for various vented Li-ion gas compositions found in the litera­
ture. The study showed that LBV ranged from 0.3 m/s to 1.1 m/s, 
depending on the state of charge (SOC) and cell chemistry. Kennedy 
et al. (2021) studied the release rates, total volume released, and gas 
composition from a single cell to an array of five and ten cells. The study 
showed that the venting speed, the total amount of gas released, and cell 
to cell propagation increased as the SOC increased. For a more 
compressive literature study, we suggest the articles by Fernandes et al. 
(2018), Wang et al. (2019), and Baird et al. (2020). 
Experimentally quantifying fundamental properties for failing LIBs is 
essential for understanding safety issues; however, it can be costly and 
time-consuming and can be partly incomplete. Computational fluid 
dynamics (CFD) simulations have become essential for evaluating ex­
plosion consequences and risks, especially in the process industry 
(Diakow et al., 2018; Hansen et al., 2010; Hansen and Middha, 2008; 
Shen et al., 2020). Using CFD tools such as FLACS, OpenFOAM, and 
ANSYS Fluent to predict explosion pressures, blast loads (impulse), and 
gas dispersion can significantly improve the safety of a design. Most CFD 
simulations related to LIBs are on single-cell failure, single-cell thermal 
runaway characterization, and cell-to-cell propagation (Kim et al., 2007, 
2021; Srinivasan et al., 2020). In a report by DNV GL (Helgesen, 2019), 
the LIB explosion hazard was investigated by CFD simulations of gas 
dispersion and gas explosions in maritime LIB installations. DNV GL 
reported explosion pressures between 90 kPa (gauge) and 270 kPa 
(gauge) in a partly confined geometry depending on the Li-ion gas 
release profile. 
The benefits from simulations are heavily dependent on the predic­
tion accuracy of the CFD models. Therefore, this study explores the 
prediction accuracy of the XiFoam combustion model/solver in the 
open-source CFD toolbox OpenFOAM (CFD Direct, 2021; H. G. Weller 
et al., 1998). More specifically, we analyze prediction accuracy of the 
temporal evolution of the pressure, maximum pressure peak, positive 
impulse, and the spatial evolution of the flame front for two gas com­
positions in a 1-m-long explosion channel, partly filled with 18650 
cell-like cylinders. In addition, two different channel geometries were 
studied by varying the location of an identical set of 40 18650 cell-like 
cylinders. The prediction accuracy with an early-onset for turbulent 
flame propagation was investigated with the cylinders close to the ig­
nitions source. Whereas with the cylinders in the center, i.e., further 
away from the ignition source, the prediction accuracy with an initial 
laminar flame propagation stage could be examined. 
Finally, in addition to two gas compositions and the two geometries, 
the CFD simulations were compared at three different fuel-air equiva­
lence ratios (φ) 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2, resulting in a total of 12 simulation 
cases. The numerical and experimental condition was typical atmo­
spheric conditions, 293 K and 101.3 kPa (absolute).

2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Experimental setup 
The explosion channel’s length, width, and height are 1000.0 mm, 
65.0 mm, and 116.5 mm, respectively. Two different channel setups 
were analyzed. The channel setup referred to as the inner channel ge­
ometry had 40 18650 cell-like cylinders near the closed end of the 
channel, whereas the channel setup referred to as the center channel 
geometry had 40 18650 cell-like cylinders approximately in the center 
of the channel. Each cylinder has a diameter of 18 mm and a length of 
650 mm, the same dimensions as a 18650 Li-ion cell. Furthermore, the 
distance between the cells in the vertical and horizontal direction is 4.6 
mm (±0.1 mm), creating a 0.5 void ratio and maximum blockage ratio of 
0.77 in the obstructed part of the channel. For the inner channel ge­
ometry, the center of the first column of cylinders was 40 mm from the 
closed end of the channel. The center of the first column of cells was 400 
mm from the closed end of the channel for the center channel geometry. 
Fig. 1 a) shows a photo of the explosion channel with the center channel 
geometry, and Fig. 1 b) shows a schematic illustration of the experi­
mental setup with dimensions. 
The premixed fuel-air inlet is located 50 mm from the closed end of 
the channel. With a porous lid attached to the open end of the channel, 
the channel’s volume was exchanged eight times to ensure a homoge­
nous mixture. After filling, there was a 1-min delay before ignition to 
reduce convective flow. Moreover, the ignition duration was 0.02 s, 
which gives two sparks generated from an AC transformer with an 
output voltage of 10 kV and a current of 20 mA. At the top of the 
channel, four Kistler pressure transducers spaced 250, 450, 650, and 
850 mm from the closed end of the channel recorded the explosion 
pressure. A Photron SA-1 high-speed camera records the flame propa­
gation with frame rates ranging from 10 000 and 22 500 frames per 
second, depending on the flame propagation speed. 
The gas compositions shown in Table 1 are taken from a previously 
published study by Henriksen et al. (M. Henriksen et al., 2021). The 
High LBV Li-ion gas composition has a relatively high LBV compared to 
other published Li-ion vent gas compositions (Baird et al., 2020; M. 
Henriksen et al., 2021), and the Simplified Li-ion gas composition is a 
pseudo/simplified Li-ion vent gas, which has an LBV in the same range 
as several different types of LIBs (M. Henriksen et al., 2021). The High 
LBV Li-ion gas was supplied from a premixed gas bottle prepared by a 
supplier, whereas two separate gas bottles supplied the hydrogen and 
methane for the Simplified Li-ion gas. Furthermore, the φ and the fuel 
ratio in the Simplified Li-ion gas were controlled by adjusting separate 
rotameters for the fuel and air. All the gas bottles had a purity above 
99.95%. 
The flame front position and velocity were determined using an in- 
house developed image processing code from the high-speed video. 
The pressure data, flame front position, and velocity were post- 
processed by a Savitzky-Golay filter (Savitzky and Golay, 1964) before 
further analysis.

2.2. CFD simulation 
The XiFoam model/solver, part of the OpenFOAM toolbox’s (CFD 
Direct, 2021; H. G. Weller et al., 1998) official release, was used for all 
simulations. In XiFoam, the flame is modeled as a laminar flamelet, 
which assumes that the turbulent premixed flame comprises a group of 
laminar flamelets (Peters, 1988). With the laminar flamelet approach, a

To determine the discretized schemes and model parameters to apply

1.0 with the center channel geometry and compared the results to an 
experiment with similar conditions (case 38). For the comparison, the 
focus was on the flame propagation and explosion pressure in pressure 
sensor 1 (PS1). This comparison led to the following discretized schemes 
and models presented. 
The time integration was discretized using the second-order Crank- 
Nicolson scheme with a ratio of 0.6 forward Euler and 0.4 Crank- 
Nicolson. For the gradient and Laplacian/diffusion terms, the second- 
order linear scheme was used. Furthermore, the three different 
second-order schemes, linear, linear-upwind, and limited-linear, were 
used for the divergence schemes. The discretized equations are solved 
using the PIMPLE algorithm, a combination of PISO (Pressure Implicit 
with Splitting Operators) and SIMPLE (Semi-Implicit Method for 
Pressure-Linked Equations). 
Large-eddy simulation (LES) was chosen as the turbulence approach, 
using the subgrid model proposed by Akira Yoshizawa (1986) for 
compressible turbulent shear flows. The Van-Driest dampening function 
was used for wall turbulence treatment, with the A+ coefficient and ΔC 
equal 26 and 0.158, respectively. 
The combustion, transport, and thermodynamic properties were 
generated using the mech2Foam code (Henriksen and Bjerketvedt, 
2021a, p. 2). mech2Foam generates the NASA polynomial (McBride 
et al., 1993), Sutherland (1893), and Gülder coefficients using a speci­
fied reaction mechanism. A study by Henriksen et al. (M. Henriksen 
et al., 2021) has demonstrated that the GRI-Mech 3.0 reaction mecha­
nism accurately predicts the LBV for the two gas compositions in 
Table 1, and therefore use in this study. 
Two computer-aided design (CAD) geometries were drawn, with the 
exact dimensions as the experimental channel geometries. The initial 
cell size is set by the background mesh generated in the utility bloch­
Mesh, with the initial cell size in the channel of 4 mm in all directions. At 
the open end of the channel, the cell size expands linearly in all di­
rections to 8 mm, creating a rectangular frustum with a length of 500 
mm outside the rectangular channel, as illustrated in Fig. 2 a). Using the 
snappyHexMesh utility in OpenFOAM, the background mesh is snapped 
to the CAD drawing and refined to three layers with half the initial cell 
size at the channel walls. At the cylinder/cell walls, the first three layers 
have a fourth of the initial cell size, followed by an additional three

layers with half the initial cell size, as shown in Fig. 2 c). The total 
amount of cells for the inner and center channel geometry was 944 849 
and 945 843, respectively. 
Fig. 2 a) shows that the boundaries are divided into two domains, 
wall boundaries and open boundaries. Typical wall boundary conditions 
(grey part of Fig. 2 a)) were set on the channel walls, and typical open 
boundary conditions (black part of Fig. 2 a)) were set on the boundaries 
outside the channel. A volume outside the channel was included in the 
computational domain to reduce errors caused by the outlet boundary 
conditions. Inside the channel, the species were premixed fuel and air, 
and outside of the channel, there was only air. The atmospheric condi­
tions for the simulations were 293 K and 101.3 kPa (absolute), similar to 
the overall experimental conditions. Table 2 lists all the wall and open 
boundary conditions used for each variable in the simulations. 
Finally, we referred to the OpenFOAM user guide to further explain 
the boundary conditions and discretization schemes (CFD Direct, 2021). 
The CFD base case is given in the supplementary materials. 
In Table 3, all the experimental cases are listed, with gas composi­
tion, φ, channel geometry, and the corresponding CFD simulation case

3. Results 
The model parameters and discretization schemes used for all sim­
ulations were determined by comparing the experimental Case 38 and 
the High CFD 1.0 center simulation case. Fig. 3 compares the recorded 
pressure from the four pressure sensors (PS) for these two cases. The 
simulated explosion pressure at PS1 was used as one of the target pa­
rameters in the optimization, and therefore has the lowest deviation of 
the four pressure sensors. PS4 had the highest difference in the 
maximum pressure peak of 117 kPa and a relative deviation of 61%. 
Fig. 4 shows the comparison of Case 38 and the simulation case High 
CFD 1.0 center for the temporal flame front position and flame front 
velocity and the spatial flame front velocity. The flame front position in 
Fig. 4 a) shows a good agreement between the simulated and experi­
mental results. Fig. 4b) and c) shows that the simulated flame acceler­
ation is under-predicted after the flame reaches the cylinders. 
Fig. 5 shows the numerical and experimental maximum pressure 
peaks for each pressure sensor recorded in the inner channel geometry 
for the High LBV Li-ion gas and the Simplified Li-ion gas. The highest 
maximum pressure for the High LBV Li-ion gas was 156 kPa (gauge), 
recorded at PS3 in case 10 (φ = 1.38). In the numerical simulations, the 
highest maximum pressure of 89 kPa (gauge) was in the High CFD 1.2

Inner case. Furthermore, the average absolute deviation between the 
experimental and simulated maximum pressures for the High LBV Li-ion 
gas is 38 kPa, with a maximum absolute deviation of 64 kPa for case 05 
(at PS4). 
For the Simplified Li-ion gas experiments, the highest maximum 
pressure peak was 56 kPa (gauge) (at PS1) in case 26 (φ = 1.10). The 
highest simulated maximum pressure was 77 kPa (gauge) (at PS2) in the 
Simple CFD 1.0 Inner case. Finally, the average absolute deviation be­
tween the experiments and simulations for the Simplified Li-ion gas was 
14 kPa, with a maximum deviation of 28 kPa for case 21 (at PS2). 
Fig. 6 shows the simulated and experimental maximum pressure 
peaks from the center channel geometry for each pressure sensor. For 
the High LBV Li-ion gas, the highest experimental maximum pressure of 
223 kPa (gauge) was measured at PS3 for case 41 (φ = 1.09), and the 
highest simulated maximum pressure of 94 kPa (gauge) was measured at 
PS1 for the High CFD 1.2 Center case. Moreover, the average absolute 
deviance between the experimental and numerical results was 64 kPa, 
with a maximum absolute deviation of 137 kPa for case 43 (at PS3). 
The highest maximum pressure peaks for the Simplified Li-ion gas 
were 55 kPa (gauge) measured at PS1 in case 58 (φ = 1.01) and 119 kPa 
(gauge) at PS1 in simulation case Simple CFD 1.0 Center. The average 
absolute deviation was 50 kPa, and the maximum absolute deviation 
was 97 kPa PS1 for case 62. 
Fig. 7 shows the positive impulses for each pressure sensor for the 
inner channel geometry experiments and simulations. The positive im­
pulse was calculated by numerically integrating the maximum pressure 
peak, with the upper and lower integral limits set to one-tenth of the 
maximum pressure. All maximum values for the experimental and 
simulated positive impulses were recorded on the first pressure sensor 
(PS1) for both gas compositions. 
The maximum experimental positive impulse was 188 kPa ms and 
160 kPa ms for the High LBV Li-ion gas (case 11, φ = 1.47) and the 
Simplified Li-ion gas (case 26, φ = 1.10) in the inner channel geometry, 
respectively. In the simulations, the maximum positive impulse was 313 
kPa ms (High CFD 1.2 Inner) and 280 kPa ms (Simple CFD 1.0 Inner) for 
the High LBV Li-ion gas and the Simplified Li-ion gas, respectively. The 
absolute average deviation between simulation and experimental posi­
tive impulse results for the High LBV Li-ion gas was 100 kPa ms, whereas 
82 kPa ms for the Simplified Li-ion gas. Furthermore, the maximum 
absolute deviation was 171 kPa ms (case 06, at PS2) and 144 kPa ms

(case 20, at PS1) for the High LBV Li-ion gas and Simplified Li-ion gas, 
respectively. 
Fig. 8 shows the experimental and numerically positive impulses for 
each pressure sensor for all center channel geometry cases. All 
maximum positive impulses were recorded on the first pressure sensor 
(PS1) for both gas compositions in the experiments and numerical 
simulations, like the inner channel geometry cases. For the High LBV Li- 
ion gas, the experimental maximum positive impulse was 591 kPa ms 
(case 42, φ = 1.18), whereas in the simulation, 666 kPa ms for case High 
CFD 1.2 Center. The absolute average deviation between the simulation 
and experiments for the High LBV Li-ion gas was 100 kPa ms, with a 
maximum absolute deviation of 243 kPa ms for case 36 (at PS2). 
For the Simplified Li-ion gas, the experimental maximum positive 
impulse was 324 kPa ms (case 58, φ = 1.01). In the simulation, the 
maximum positive impulse was 743 kPa ms measured in the Simple CFD 
1.0 Center case. Moreover, the absolute average deviation between the 
experimental and numerical positive impulse is 206 kPa ms, with a 
maximum absolute deviation of 532 kPa ms in case 62 (at PS1). 
Further quantification of the model performance was done by 
calculating the statistical quantities, mean geometric variance (VG), and 
mean geometric bias (MG) for the temporal pressure evolution, 
maximum pressure, positive impulse, and spatial evolution of the flame 
front velocity. Table 4 presents the criteria used to assess the model 
performance, taken from the model evaluation protocol for the HySEA 
project (Hisken et al., 2020), which is based upon the MEGGE protocol 
(Model Evaluation Group Gas Explosion, 1996). 
Fig. 9 shows the MG and VG values for the inner channel geometry 
High LBV Li-ion gas and Simplified Li-ion gas cases. The calculated VG 
and MG values for the temporal pressure evolution are within the limit 
for excellent model performance, as shown in Fig. 9 a). For the MG and 
VG values in Fig. 9 b) (maximum pressure peak), only case 42 had an MG 
value slightly above the limit for excellent model performance. The MG 
and VG values shown in Fig. 9a) and b) indicate that the XiFoam model 
predicted the maximum pressure peaks and temporal pressure evolution 
accurately for both gas compositions in the inner channel geometry. For 
several cases, the MG values for the positive impulse were outside the 
acceptable limit. The spatial flame front velocity MG and VG values were 
within the acceptable limits for all, except case 15. 
The overall XiFoam model performance was evaluated by equally 
weighting the arithmetic mean MG and VG values of the temporal 
pressure evolution, maximum pressure peaks, positive impulse, and 
spatial evolution of the flame front velocity. For the inner channel ge­
ometry, the overall average MG and VG were 0.96 and 1.26 for the High 
LBV Li-ion gas, respectively, whereas the overall average MG and VG for 
the Simplified Li-ion gas were 0.89 and 1.36, respectively. Both the 
overall averaged MG and VG for the two gas compositions are within the 
acceptable performance criteria.

cases. The MG and VG values for the temporal pressure evolution and 
the maximum pressure are all within the acceptable criteria for both gas 
compositions. The positive impulse MG and VG values for the High LBV 
Li-ion cases are all within the excellent performance criterion. However, 
for the Simplified Li-ion gas, only case 57 is within the MG acceptable 
criterion. This poor model performance is reflected in the predicted 
positive impulse of the Simplified Li-ion gas in Fig. 8. For all cases, the 
spatial evolution of the flame front velocity MG and VG values are 
within the acceptable criteria for both gas compositions, with seven out 
of ten within the excellent criteria. 
The overall averaged MG and VG values were 1.10 and 1.14 for the 
High LBV Li-ion gas, respectively. For the Simplified Li-ion gas, the 
overall average MG and VG values were 0.80 1.86, respectively. 
Furthermore, the overall average MG and VG values were within the 
excellent performance criteria for the High LBV Li-ion gas. For the 
Simplified Li-ion gas, the overall average MG and VG were within 
acceptable model performance criteria.

4. Discussion 
4.1. Variance in the experimental results 
Figs. 5 and 6 shows that parallel experiments can give significantly 
different maximum pressures peaks. These differences in the results are 
especially noticeable for the center channel geometry High LBV Li-ion 
gas experiments at pressure sensors 2, 3, and 4. The differences in the 
maximum pressure peaks can be as high as 60–70 kPa, which is in the 
same range as the more significant deviations between the simulation 
and experimental results. Although minor differences were noticed in 
the flame front velocity and surface in parallel experiments, no phe­
nomena or measured parameter could be attributed to the experiments 
with an increased or reduced maximum pressure peak. It is common to 
compare simulated and experimental maximum pressure peaks results

(Diakow et al., 2018; Shen et al., 2020); however, it may not be an ideal 
comparable parameter due to potential variance between parallel ex­
periments as observed in this study. 
4.2. Model performance 
Based on the overall average MG and VG values, the XiFoam model 
performed acceptable for the Simplified Li-ion gas and performed 
excellently for the High LBV Li-ion gas for both channel geometries. 
XiFoam had the highest model performance for the High LBV Li-ion gas 
in the center channel geometry, which is expected since the model pa­
rameters were adjusted to this configuration at a φ equal to 1.0. How­
ever, the model showed discrepancies in predict the maximum pressure 
peaks recorded at PS3 and PS4, as seen in Fig. 6. In the simulations, the 
flame thickness grows as it propagates through the geometry. This in­
crease in flame thickness probably dampens the maximum pressure 
peaks caused by the rapid increase in flame acceleration when the flame 
passes through the cylinders. Although the model does not predict the 
maximum pressure peaks at these sensors, the positive impulse is 
predicated with less deviation. 
The XiFoam model performance for the Simplified Li-ion gas was 
lower than for the High LBV Li-ion gas, based on the MG and VG values. 
Although the overall average model performance for the center channel 
geometry Simplified Li-ion gas cases were within the acceptable criteria, 
only one case was within acceptable performance criteria for positive 
impulse, as seen in Fig. 10 c). Additionally, there is a significant 
discrepancy between the simulated and experimental flame front posi­
tion before the flame reaches the cylinders for these cases. This

discrepancy reveals that the flame accelerates more rapidly in the initial 
stages in the simulation compared to the experiments. The higher flame 
acceleration leads to the higher maximum pressure peaks, as seen in 
Fig. 6a) and b) for the Simplified Li-ion gas. Conversely, the experi­
mental and simulated flame acceleration is in the same range for the 
inner channel geometry Simplified Li-ion gas cases, resulting in better 
model performance. 
4.3. Model parameters and discretization 
There are many different model parameters and discretization 
schemes to adjust and choose from in the OpenFOAM toolbox. Our focus 
was on the XiFoam combustion parameters and the discretization of 
time and divergence terms to limit the number of parameters and set­
tings. However, other model parameters or discretization schemes could 
also significantly impact the simulation performance than those chosen 
in this study. 
The Xi (Ξ) variable in Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) is the ratio between laminar 
and turbulent burning velocity. Xi, cannot be lower than one and will 
thus only increase or not affect the propagation velocity. For the center 
channel geometry, the initial flame acceleration was slightly higher in 
most simulation cases compared to the experiments. This discrepancy in 
flame acceleration was especially noticeable for the Simplified Li-ion gas 
cases. In the combustion property file, three variables can be adjusted to 
affect the value of Xi, XiCoef, XiShapeCoef, and uPrimeCoef. Using the Xi 
transport model, only changes to the uPrimeCoef significantly altered 
flame acceleration. uPrimeCoef is multiplied with the turbulent kinetic 
energy (k) used to evaluate the Xi value. Initially, the uPrimeCoef coef­
ficient was set to 0.6, which has given good results in previous simula­
tions and fitted reasonably well for the High CFD 1.0 Center validation

13
case. However, for the center channel geometry Simplified Li-ion gas 
simulation cases, a lower value of the uPrimeCoef coefficient would have 
reduced flame acceleration and thus lower maximum pressure peaks. 
For example, altering the uPrimeCoef coefficient to 0.1 in the Simple CFD 
1.0 Center simulation case will result in a maximum pressure peak of 25 
kPa (gauge). Changes to uPrimeCoef could lead to an odd-shaped flame 
surface compared to experiments and previous simulations, as depicted 
in Fig. 11 c). The odd-shaped flame surface can cause significant changes 
to the predicted flame front position and velocity. 
Different discretization schemes were tested to analyze if they had 
any significant effect on the solution. Discretizing time using first-order 
forward Euler resulted in numerically stable simulations, with little to 
no effect when changing the discretization schemes for the divergence 
terms. However, changing the time discretization scheme to second- 
order backward Euler or Crank-Nicolson significantly impacted the 
flame propagation. Using the second-order backward scheme would 
lead to convergence errors. Using the Crank-Nicolson scheme, the 
intended simulation time was achieved (for most cases) with a Crank- 
Nicolson coefficient between 0.1 and 0.6. The larger Crank-Nicolson 
coefficient usually increased the flame acceleration and thus the 
maximum pressure peak. For example, by increasing the coefficient to 
0.6 for the High CFD 1.0 Center simulation case, the maximum pressure 
peak was 450 kPa (gauge), 300 kPa higher than for the simulation case 
using a coefficient of 0.4. Although a higher coefficient increased the 
flame acceleration, it could also lead to similar odd-shaped flames, as 
shown in Fig. 11 c). Numerical instabilities probably cause the odd- 
shaped flame surfaces. Thus, a linearUpwind discretization scheme 
was used to minimize the numerical instability and retain second-order 
accuracy for most divergence terms. 
Adjusting the value of uPrimeCoef and the Crank-Nicolson coefficient 
in post-analysis for each simulation case, it is possible to predict the 
desired target parameter fairly accurately, whether it be flame acceler­
ation or maximum pressure peak, or positive impulse. However, accu­
rately predicting all three of these parameters in the same simulation 
with the XiFoam model is proven to be challenging. 
Finally, one of the reasons that the XiFoam was chosen as the com­
bustion model was its capability to simulate both small-scale (Mathias 
Henriksen et al., 2021) and large-scale (Li et al., 2021) case­
s/geometries. Although the XiFoam model gives an overall acceptable 
model performance for the two geometries and gas mixtures, it is un­
certain how well XiFoam will perform for large-scale Li-ion battery in­
cidents. Validating CFD combustion models with small/laboratory-scale 
experiments is not uncommon (Elshimy et al., 2021; Hansen et al., 2005; 
Middha et al., 2007; Oran and Gamezo, 2007); however, it does not 
remove the necessity of large-scale experiment comparison. As of now, 
there are few large-scale experiments relevant for Li-ion battery 
incidents CFD comparison. The comparison in this study is a step for­
ward, showing the capability of predicting small-scale Li-ion battery 
explosions and addressing some of the challenges encountered using the 
XiFoam combustion model. To improve the XiFoam model confidence 
further, the focus should be on large-scale experiments of battery in­
cidents in future research. 
4.4. Final observations 
In the simulations, the pressure peaks are broader than in most ex­
periments, making it impossible to predict both the maximum pressure 
peak and the positive impulse with extreme precision. In the simula­
tions, the flame thickness is initially thin with the thickness of a few 
cells, but as it propagates, it broadens and can grow to a thickness larger 
than 200 mm. However, the flame thickness of an actual flame is at least 
a hundred times thinner than this. Since the numerical flame thickness is 
large, the total heat of combustion is released over a larger volume than 
the actual experimental flame, and thus generating a broader pressure 
peak. A possible solution for this issue in the XiFoam model could be to 
reduce the cell size; unfortunately, this could not be investigated further 
due to limited computational resources. 
For the experimental center channel geometry Simplified Li-ion gas 
cases, only the cases with a φ below 1.19 (case 50 to 61) would prop­
agate through the cylinders without quenching. Most cases would 
completely quench within the cylinders in the experiments with φ 1.19 
and above (case 62 to 70). However, a few experiments (case 63, 67, 68, 
and 69) eventually propagated through, although the time from no 
visible flame to visible flame in the high-speed video was on average 
0.21 s. By contrast, the average time for the flame to reach the cylinders 
after ignition for these cases was 0.05 s. A common occurrence for cases 
63, 67, 68, and 69, the first visible flame after “quenching,” was always 
in the top part of the channel. 
Case 62, which had a φ of 1.19, propagated past the cylinders similar 
to those experimental cases with a φ below 1.19. For case 62, the flame 
was partly quenched while propagated in the center of the cylinders. 
However, the flame continued to propagate without quenching in the 
top and bottom of the channel. Since case 62 propagated through the 
cylinders, similarly to the experiments with φ below 1.19, it was the only 
experimental case compared to the Simple CFD 1.2 Center simulation 
case. 
Conversely, all the center channel geometry High LBV Li-ion gas 
cases propagated through without any indication of quenching. The LBV 
for the High LBV Li-ion gas is more than twice that of the Simplified Li- 
ion gas at similar φ (M. Henriksen et al., 2021), which is an essential 
parameter for this phenomenon. The quenching may be caused by a 
highly turbulent flow, which may be violating the XiFoam laminar

flamelet assumption. Further investigation is needed to explain this 
phenomenon more deeply, which is beyond the scope of this study. 
5. Conclusion 
This study examined the XiFoam model performance, a combustion 
solver part of the open-source CFD toolbox OpenFOAM. The XiFoam 
model performance was evaluated by comparing numerical simulations 
and experiments of premixed gas explosions in a 1-m explosion channel 
partly filled with 18650 cell-like cylinders. In addition to comparing two 
geometries with different locations of the 40 18650 cell-like cylinders, 
two gas compositions with significantly different LBV at several φ were 
compared. The model performance was based on the prediction accu­
racy of the temporal pressure evolution, maximum pressure peak, pos­
itive impulse, and spatial evolution of the flame front velocity. 
Based upon the overall average MG and VG values and the model 
performance criteria in Table 4, the XiFoam had an overall acceptable 
model performance. XiFoam had the highest prediction accuracy for the 
center channel geometry High LBV Li-ion gas cases; however, this was 
expected since one of these cases was used to determine the combustion 
model parameters and discretization schemes. XiFoam had the lowest 
prediction accuracy for the center channel geometry Simplified Li-ion 
gas cases. The lower prediction accuracy was mainly due to an over- 
predicted flame acceleration in the initial laminar flame propagation 
stage. 
Adjusting the combustion parameter uPrimeCoef and the Crank- 
Nicolson coefficient for the time discretization would significantly 
change the flame propagation and thus the simulation results. By 
adjusting these parameters in post-analysis for each simulation, one can 
increase the prediction accuracy significantly. However, predicting with 
high precision the maximum pressure peak and positive impulse in the 
same simulation is difficult with the XiFoam combustion model. 
Although the XiFoam overall prediction accuracy for the two gas 
mixtures with the channel geometries was within the acceptable model 
performance criteria, it is uncertain the XiFoam model would perform 
for large-scale and more realistic geometry, like a BESS. In future 
research, the XiFoam model should be compared with large-scale ex­
periments of battery incidents to improve on the XiFoam model 
assessment done in this study.
