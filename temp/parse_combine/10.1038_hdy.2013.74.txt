Genetic architecture of survival and ﬁtness-related traits
in two populations of Atlantic salmon
ALS Houde1, CC Wilson2 and BD Neff1
The additive genetic effects of traits can be used to predict evolutionary trajectories, such as responses to selection.
Non-additive genetic and maternal environmental effects can also change evolutionary trajectories and inﬂuence phenotypes,
but these effects have received less attention by researchers. We partitioned the phenotypic variance of survival and ﬁtness-
related traits into additive genetic, non-additive genetic and maternal environmental effects using a full-factorial breeding
design within two allopatric populations of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Maternal environmental effects were large at early
life stages, but decreased during development, with non-additive genetic effects being most signiﬁcant at later juvenile stages
(alevin and fry). Non-additive genetic effects were also, on average, larger than additive genetic effects. The populations,
generally, did not differ in the trait values or inferred genetic architecture of the traits. Any differences between the populations
for trait values could be explained by maternal environmental effects. We discuss whether the similarities in architectures of
these populations is the result of natural selection across a common juvenile environment.

INTRODUCTION
The genetic architecture underlying phenotypic traits can be used to
predict evolutionary trajectories. In particular, responses to selection
are directly related to the amount of additive genetic variance
(Falconer and Mackay, 1996). Non-additive genetic effects, on the
other hand, have not been considered as important in part because
they cannot be used to predict the response to selection (Lynch,
1994). However, there is an increasing evidence that non-additive
genetic effects are key components of phenotypes (Crnokrak and Roff,
1995; Roff and Emerson, 2006). Furthermore, non-additive genetic
effects are a cause of inbreeding depression (Crnokrak and Roff, 1999;
Keller and Waller, 2002) and can be converted to additive genetic
effects, for example, during a bottleneck, which can then provide
genetic variation for natural selection to act on (Carson, 1990; also see
Neff and Pitcher, 2008).
Phenotypic variance can also be explained by maternal environ-
mental effects (Falconer and Mackay, 1996) and these effects can
also affect evolutionary trajectories (Ra¨sa¨nen and Kruuk, 2007).
For example, maternal environmental effects can have an impact on
the rate and direction of change in response to natural selection and
can generate rapid phenotypic changes in offspring traits as a result of
the phenotypic plasticity of female traits (Mousseau and Fox, 1998;
Ra¨sa¨nen and Kruuk, 2007). Consequently, understanding the con-
tributions of all of maternal environmental effects, additive genetic
effects and non-additive genetic effects is needed to fully understand
evolutionary trajectories and the diversity of phenotypes.
Studies examining the architecture of traits have shown that the
relative contributions of genetic and maternal effects can change
during development and may be inﬂuenced by the correlation
between the trait and ﬁtness. Traits expressed during the early life
stage tend to be inﬂuenced mainly by maternal effects, whereas traits
expressed during later life stages are inﬂuenced increasingly by genetic
effects (Kruuk et al., 2008). Initial egg investments are often fully
utilized during early development, leaving later life stage traits that are
inﬂuenced by genetic effects (for example, Lindholm et al., 2006;
Evans et al., 2010). For example, in mammals, maternal effects
typically decline, whereas additive genetic effects remain constant
(for example, Wilson and Re´ale, 2006) or increase during develop-
ment (for example, Cheverud et al., 1983). In addition, life-history
traits, such as survival, that have strong correlations with ﬁtness
typically have larger non-additive than additive genetic effects,
whereas morphological traits, such as body size, that have weaker
correlations
with
ﬁtness
typically
have
larger
additive
than
non-additive genetic effects (Crnokrak and Roff, 1995; Roff and
Emerson, 2006). Independent of trait type, directional selection, or to
some extent stabilizing selection, on traits can erode additive genetic
effects, ﬁxing alleles across loci and leaving only non-additive genetic
effects (Willis and Orr, 1993). For example, morphological traits that
are under strong directional selection in domestic species often have
larger non-additive than additive genetic variances (Roff and
Emerson, 2006).
In this study, we examine the phenotypic variance of survival and
ﬁtness-related traits at three early life-history developmental stages
(egg, alevin and fry) in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Atlantic salmon
have declined sharply throughout their North American range over
the past 2 centuries (Dunﬁeld, 1985). Lake Ontario once supported
the largest freshwater population of Atlantic salmon in the world, but
was extirpated by 1900 (COSEWIC, 2010). Several candidate

populations are now being considered for reintroduction into Lake
Ontario based on ecological evaluations, including Atlantic salmon
from the LaHave River, Nova Scotia and Sebago Lake, Maine
(Dimond and Smitka, 2005). We used a full-factorial quantitative
genetic breeding design to partition phenotypic variance in survival
and ﬁtness-related traits to maternal environmental, additive and
non-additive genetic effects. The resultant data were used to examine
the relative contributions of additive and non-additive genetic effects
to morphological and life-history traits, as well as any shift in
contributions during early life stages.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Crosses
Adult broodstock ﬁsh from each source population were provided by the
Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (OMNR). For this study, LaHave
(n ¼ 25) and Sebago families (n ¼ 25) were produced on 4 November 2010 at
the OMNR Harwood Fish Culture Station, Harwood, Ontario, Canada
following the methods of Pitcher and Neff (2006). Five females and ﬁve males
from each population were mated in all possible combinations to produce full-
factorial breeding design (Lynch and Walsh, 1998, p. 598). Subsamples of eggs
(n ¼ 7) from each female were measured for diameter (nearest 0.01mm) using
digital callipers and mass (nearest 0.0001g) using a digital scale. Those eggs
were then frozen at 201C, transported to Western University and kept frozen
for subsequent energy content analysis. Remaining eggs were randomly placed
into sections of Heath-style incubators and then tanks after hatching at the
OMNR Codrington Research Facility, Codrington, Ontario, using two to three
sections for each full-sibling family based on offspring numbers (that is, to
keep densities in sections equal). Details of the broodstock and rearing of the
families are provided in Supplementary Appendix A.
Survival and ﬁtness-related traits
We collected six measures of survival as direct measures of early life ﬁtness: egg
survival (fertilized egg to hatch, days 0–83, also examined as a rate over time);
alevin survival (post-hatch until yolk sac absorption, days 84–138, also
examined as a rate over time); fry survival (yolk sac absorption until released
into the wild, days 139–192); and overall survival (fertilized egg until released
into the wild). We also measured 12 traits that are known to be related to
ﬁtness in salmonids (Metcalfe and Thorpe, 1992; Berg et al., 2001; Pakkasmaa
et al., 2001; Koskinen et al., 2002): egg diameter and mass; egg contents at
fertilization (relative fat, protein and energy); development time to hatch (also
examined as a rate over time); body length at hatch; yolk sac volume at hatch;
body length at yolk sac absorption; speciﬁc growth rate; and yolk sac
conversion efﬁciency. Details on the methodology to estimate these parameters
are provided in Supplementary Appendix A.
Statistical analysis of parental and population effects
All six survival and 12 ﬁtness-related traits were examined for a population
effect in addition to individual parental effects (dam and/or sire effects),
position effects (tray and tank effects) and density effects using Akaike
Information Criteria forward step-wise model selection in R 2.10.1 (available
at http://www.r-project.org/). Statistical signiﬁcance was set at a ¼ 0.05, and all
non-proportional data were checked visually for approximate normality using
histograms before the analysis with parametric statistics (Crawley, 2005).
Linear models were used for normally distributed data and binomial models
were used for binary data (that is, one for alive and zero for dead and one for
hatched and zero for non-hatched). Effects that did not cause a change in
Akaike Information Criteria of greater than 10 were considered to be poorly
supported and were removed from the model (Burnham and Anderson, 2002).
Remaining effects were tested for signiﬁcance using an analysis of variance of a
linear model or an analysis of deviance of a binomial model. Non-signiﬁcant
effects, starting with non-signiﬁcant interactions, were removed one at a time.
If individual parental effects were retained by the model selection process,
the data were analyzed using mixed-effects models that treated individual
parental effects as random intercepts and examined population as a ﬁxed effect
(in addition to the ﬁxed effects of density if retained by the selection process).
Any signiﬁcant position effect if retained by the selection process was treated as
a random intercept. Restricted Maximum Likelihood linear mixed-effects
models were used for normally distributed data, and Laplace approximation
binomial generalized linear mixed-effects models were used for binary data in
the lme4 package of R. The mixed-effects model output in the lme4 package
does not produce signiﬁcance values for ﬁxed effects; therefore, signiﬁcance for
the population effect was determined using a likelihood ratio test between the
full model and a reduced model without population.
Statistical analysis of architecture
In addition to parental and population effects, we examined nine out of the 18
survival and ﬁtness-related traits for architecture. The nine traits that were not
examined were the overall survival measure, because we could not control for
position effects (see Supplementary Appendix A), the ﬁve egg traits (that is,
diameter, mass, relative fat, protein and energy), because data were collected
from only one family for each female, and the three traits examined as a rate
over time (that is, egg survival, alevin survival and development time to
hatch), because standard analyses cannot incorporate the inclusion of a time
variable. First, the phenotypic variance was partitioned into random effects for
dam ID (VD, maternal environmental and maternal additive genetic variance),
sire ID (VS, paternal additive genetic variance) and dam ID sire ID (VD  S,
non-additive genetic variance) components using a mixed-effects model.
We used individual estimates of traits (for example, individual survival and
length) to account for within-family variation, because means of family
replicates overestimates genetic effects (see Puurtinen et al., 2009; Neff et al.
2011). Means of family replicates were used for speciﬁc growth rate and yolk
sac conversion efﬁciency because individual estimates were not available.
Regardless of the Akaike Information Criteria criterion noted above, position
effects were always included as a random effect to ensure that we did not
overestimate non-additive genetic effects. Signiﬁcances of the variance com-
ponents were determined by likelihood ratio tests as above. The genetic and
environmental variance components were calculated on the basis of (Lynch
and Walsh, 1998, p. 509): VD ¼ 1
4 VA þVM; VS ¼ 1
4 VA; and VD  S ¼ 1
4 VN.
Negative variance components were set to a value of zero.
Using a similar method outlined in Neff and Fraser (2010), bootstrap 95%
conﬁdence intervals (CIs) were produced by ﬁrst resampling with replacement
the individuals within each replicate for each family until the original size was
reproduced for the trait assessments. We resampled individuals to account for
within-family variation and ensure that the genetic effects were not over-
estimated (see Puurtinen et al., 2009). We resampled means per replicate for
speciﬁc growth rate and yolk sac conversion efﬁciency because individual
estimates were not available. Using the resampled data set, additive,
non-additive and maternal environmental variance components were calcu-
lated as a percentage of the phenotypic variance. The resampling and
calculations were repeated 1000 times and the 95% CI was determined for
each parameter. In addition, pair-wise population comparisons for each metric
were done by calculating for one population the proportion of comparisons
that were either larger or smaller than the other population. The proportions
served as one-tailed P-values testing for differences between populations.
RESULTS
Summary statistics of survival and ﬁtness-related traits are presented
in Table 1 and Supplementary Appendix B. Of the ‘dead’ eggs that
were removed from the Heath trays, 99.7% (43 397 out of 43536
eggs) were fertilized. There was nearly 100% offspring mortality for
one Sebago female (n ¼ 5 families). Thus, the offspring from those
families were not used in any of the analyses. Individual parental
effects and position effects (in the Heath trays and tanks) had
signiﬁcant inﬂuences on survival and ﬁtness-related traits for model
selection (Table 2). These effects were subsequently treated as random
effects in the mixed-effects models. The examination of architecture
revealed that maternal and non-additive genetic effects explained
most of the phenotypic variance in survival and ﬁtness-related traits
(Figure 1; Supplementary Appendix C).

Survival
In both populations, dam effects were signiﬁcant for egg survival,
alevin survival (LaHave only), but not for fry survival (Supplementary
Appendix C). Sire effects were not signiﬁcant for either population,
whereas dam  sire effects were signiﬁcant for egg survival, but not
for alevin survival and fry survival (Sebago only). For the LaHave
population, maternal environmental and non-additive genetic effects
were similar in their contribution to egg survival, but maternal
environmental effects decreased, whereas non-additive genetic effects
increased during the alevin and fry stages (Figure 1). On the other
hand, for the Sebago population, non-additive genetic effects were
larger than maternal environmental effects in their contribution to
egg survival and both non-additive genetic and maternal environ-
mental effects decreased during the alevin and fry stages. These
patterns resulted in differences between populations in the genetic
architecture (additive and non-additive genetic effects) of offspring
survival. Sebago had signiﬁcantly higher non-additive genetic effects
for egg survival but lower non-additive genetic effects for fry survival
than
LaHave
(randomization

P ¼ 0.001).
Differences were also observed between the populations for maternal
environmental effects. LaHave had signiﬁcantly higher maternal
environmental effects for egg and fry survival (randomization routine
one-tailed P ¼ 0.001). There was no signiﬁcant correlations between
any of the egg content measures (relative fat, protein and energy) and
offspring survival (Pearson correlations, P40.05 for all; data not
shown).
Fitness-related traits
Dam effects were signiﬁcant for the LaHave population for develop-
ment time to hatch, body length at hatch, yolk sac volume, body
length at yolk sac absorption, speciﬁc growth rate and yolk sac
conversion efﬁciency (Supplementary Appendix C). Dam effects were
signiﬁcant for fewer ﬁtness-related traits for the Sebago population:
development time to hatch, yolk sac volume and body length at yolk
sac absorption. Sire effects on the ﬁtness-related traits were not
signiﬁcant in either population, whereas dam  sire effects were
signiﬁcant for the traits; the exceptions being for LaHave development
time to hatch and body length at hatch (Supplementary Appendix C).
In both populations, non-additive genetic effects explained more of
the phenotypic variance than maternal environmental effects for
development time to hatch, body length at hatch (Sebago only),
yolk sac volume (Sebago only), speciﬁc growth rate and yolk sac

conversion efﬁciency (Figure 1). On the other hand, maternal
environmental effects explained more of the phenotypic variance
than non-additive genetic effects for body length at hatch (LaHave
only), yolk sac volume (LaHave only) and body length at yolk
absorption. There were no signiﬁcant differences between populations
in the majority of the genetic architecture values for the ﬁtness-related
traits (randomization routine one-tailed P40.05), with exception that
Sebago had signiﬁcantly higher non-additive genetic effects for body
length at hatch than LaHave (randomization routine one-tailed
P ¼ 0.012; Figure 1). In contrast, there were signiﬁcant differences
between the populations in maternal environmental effects. LaHave
had signiﬁcantly higher maternal environmental effects for body
length at hatch, yolk sac volume and yolk sac conversion efﬁciency,
but lower maternal environmental effects for body length at yolk sac
absorption when compared with Sebago (randomization routine one-
tailed Po0.05). There was no signiﬁcant correlations between any of
the egg content measures (relative fat, protein and energy) and the
ﬁtness-related traits (Pearson correlations, P40.05 for all; data not
shown).
Population differences in performance
The populations differed at only 8 of the 18 traits that we measured
(Table 2). These traits included egg survival (rate only), alevin
survival (rate only), egg diameter and mass, body length at hatch,
development time to hatch (rate and degree-days) and yolk sac
conversion efﬁciency. For example, egg survival for the Sebago
population declined at a faster rate than the LaHave population
(Table 1). The opposite pattern was detected for alevin survival.
However, the differences were generally small between the populations
for egg diameter (0.4mm, 7% of the mean) and mass (0.02 g, 21%),
body length at hatch (0.7mm, 4%) and development time to hatch
(7 degree-days, 2%). LaHave hatched at a faster rate than Sebago.
The populations were not signiﬁcantly different in body length at
yolk sac absorption despite Sebago possessing a higher yolk sac
conversion efﬁciency than LaHave (Table 1 and 2). Although survival
rates differed between the populations, there were no signiﬁcant
differences between the populations in the ﬁnal egg and alevin
survival values (that is, days 83 and 138) (Table 2).
DISCUSSION
Our results detected maternal environmental and genetic effects that
explained more than half (mean±1s.e.: 52±6%) of the phenotypic
variance in survival and various ﬁtness-related traits. Maternal
environmental effects were prominent at early life stages, decreased
during
development,
and non-additive
effects becoming
most
prominent at later life stages. Across the nine traits that we could
examine the genetic architecture of, we found that non-additive
genetic effects were more prominent than additive effects. Our results
also revealed that the LaHave and Sebago populations did not differ,
or had small differences, for the majority of traits and, similarly, did
not differ in the genetic architecture of those traits. The few
differences between the populations that did exist were mostly
attributed to differences in maternal environmental effects.
Maternal environmental and genetic effects may be important in
explaining the phenotypic variance of survival and ﬁtness-related
traits (Qvarnstro¨m and Price, 2001). We found signiﬁcant maternal
environmental effects in the nine traits examined for architecture, and
those effects explained a mean of 14±3% of the phenotypic variance
across the traits. We also found sire effects in the traits, with additive
genetic effects explaining a mean of 8±2% of the phenotypic
variance. Similarly, 16 other studies, examining some 60 different
survival and ﬁtness-related traits in natural populations, found that
maternal environmental effects explained a mean of 26±3% of the
phenotypic variance in the traits and that additive genetic effects
explained a bit less at a mean of 18±3% (see references in Table 1 in
Puurtinen et al., 2009; also see Evans et al., 2010). Collectively, these
data suggest that maternal environmental effects may be the primary
factor contributing to survival and ﬁtness-related traits during early

development, although additive genetic effects also contribute to
phenotypic variance during this life stage.
The amount of phenotypic variance explained by maternal
environmental and genetic effects may shift during development
(Fox et al., 2003; Evans et al., 2010). Early life stages that rely on
maternal investments such as egg nutrients often have phenotypic
variances explained more by maternal environmental effects (reviewed
by Wilson and Re´ale, 2006). Later life stages instead have phenotypic
variances largely explained by genetic effects, because maternal
investments have been fully utilized (Wilson and Re´ale, 2006).
We found that maternal environmental effects explained a mean of
21±3% of the phenotypic variance across the four traits related to
egg investments (egg survival, body length at hatch, yolk sac volume
and body length at yolk sac absorption), but that genetic effects also
explained a similar amount of the variance in these traits (27±6%).
We also found that genetic effects, largely inﬂuenced by non-additive
effects, explained a mean of 47±9% of the phenotypic variance across
the remaining ﬁve traits that were collected after hatch. Maternal
environmental effects, on the other hand, captured only 8±4% of the
variance in those traits. Similarly, other studies have found that
maternal environmental and genetic effects explained about equal
amounts of the phenotypic variance for early life stage traits (see
references in Table 1 in Puurtinen et al., 2009; also see Evans et al.,
2010). Furthermore, those studies also found that genetic effects
explained 50±9% and maternal environmental effects explained only
10±4%, on average, of the phenotypic variance for traits expressed
during later life stages. Thus, the data support a shift from maternal
environmental effects to genetic effects during development, but also
suggest that non-additive genetic effects have an important role in
survival and ﬁtness-related traits.
Life-history and morphological traits may differ in the amount of
genetic variance explained by additive and non-additive genetic
effects. Life-history traits, which have strong correlations with ﬁtness,
typically have large non-additive genetic effects, whereas morphol-
ogical traits, which have weak correlations with ﬁtness, tend to have
large additive genetic effects (Crnokrak and Roff, 1995; Roff and
Emerson, 2006). However, a review recently suggested that additive
and non-additive effects contribute about equally to both life-history
and morphological traits (Puurtinen et al., 2009). We found that non-
additive genetic effects were larger than additive genetic effects for all
nine traits that we examined for architecture, except for fry survival
and development time to hatch in the Sebago population and body
length at hatch in the LaHave population. Non-additive and additive
genetic effects explained means of 30±6% and only 8±2%,
respectively, of the phenotypic variance across the traits. In our case,
the morphological traits—body length at hatch, yolk sac volume and
body length at yolk sac absorption—may have possessed larger non-
additive genetic effects because these traits typically have strong

have weak correlations with ﬁtness (see Crnokrak and Roff, 1995; Roff
and Emerson, 2006). Our data support the idea that non-additive
genetic effects are larger than additive genetic effects for traits that
have strong correlations with ﬁtness and that this pattern may be
independent of whether the traits are life-history or morphological in
nature. Some caution is warranted when making these comparisons
in our data set because our analysis is based on 5  5 crosses (albeit
both populations revealed analogous patterns).
Components that explain the phenotypic variance of ﬁtness-related
traits may be preserved across populations either by shared ancestry
or by parallel evolution (Schluter et al., 2004). If populations possess
similar traits, perhaps not surprisingly, the genetic architecture of
those traits may also be similar because natural selection may have
acted on the same genes that underlie the traits (Campbell and
Bernatchez, 2004; Turner et al., 2010; Schumer et al., 2011). We found
that the Atlantic salmon had similar genetic architectures (amounts of
additive and non-additive effects) for seven out of the nine traits
despite having a relatively large FST value. In contrast, the populations
differed in the maternal environmental effects for six out of the nine
traits. Similarities in the genetic architectures of these populations
could be the result of parallel evolution mediated by natural selection
across a common juvenile environment (that is, stream environment)
(Schluter et al., 2004). For example, the LaHave River and Sebago
Lake stream environments have similar temperatures (J Gibson,
Department of Fisheries and Oceans and M Simpson, Maine
Department of Marine Resources, unpublished data), which is a key
component of natural selection on ﬁtness-related traits in the Atlantic
salmon (Garcia de Leaniz et al., 2007). Differences in maternal
environmental effects of populations may instead reﬂect the differ-
ences in the adult environments (ocean vs lake) (see Ra¨sa¨nen and
Kruuk, 2007), but more research is needed to better understand the
source of those differences. Interestingly, both sources of broodstock
(parents) used in our study came from a common captive hatchery
environment, suggesting that the maternal environmental effects are
not directly affected by the rearing environment of the dams.
Regardless, the similar genetic architectures underlying the traits
examined here may have resulted from parallel evolution.
In conclusion, our results detail the genetic and maternal environ-
mental effects on phenotypic variance of survival and ﬁtness-related
traits in early life stages of two populations of Atlantic salmon.
We found that the populations had similar trait values and underlying
genetic architecture for the majority of traits. Our results support a
shift from the maternal environmental to genetic effects during early
development. They also indicate that non-additive genetic variance is
as or more important for survival and ﬁtness-related traits than
additive genetic variance.
