New Generation Hyperspectral Sensors  
DESIS and PRISMA Provide Improved  
Agricultural Crop Classifications
Itiya Aneece and Prasad S. Thenkabail
Abstract
Using new remote sensing technology to study agricultural crops will 
support advances in food and water security. The recently launched, 
new generation spaceborne hyperspectral sensors, German DLR 
Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer (DESIS) and Italian PRecursore 
IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA), provide unprec-
edented data in hundreds of narrow spectral bands for the study of 
the Earth. Therefore, our overarching goal in this study was to use 
these data to explore advances that can be made in agricultural 
research. We selected PRISMA and DESIS images during the 2020 grow-
ing season in California’s Central Valley to study seven major crops. 
PRISMA and DESIS images were highly correlated (R2 of 0.9–0.95). 
Out of the 235 DESIS bands (400–1000 nm) and 238 PRISMA bands 
(400–2500 nm), 26 (11%) and 45 (19%) bands, respectively, were 
optimal to study agricultural crops. These optimal bands provided 
crop type classification accuracies of 83–90%. Hyperspectral 
vegetation indices to estimate plant pigment content, stress, bio-
mass, moisture, and cellulose/lignin content were also identified.
Introduction
Twenty-first century remote sensing calls for increased use of data 
from hyperspectral sensors to advance the study of agricultural crop 
characteristics. In the past, this advance has been hindered by the 
lack of availability of spaceborne hyperspectral data covering the 
planet. The Hyperion Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) sensor was the first 
spaceborne hyperspectral sensor with publicly available data that 
provided significant insights into the possibilities of great scientific 
advances in the study of agricultural crops and vegetation (Bannari 
et al. 2015; Bhojaraja et al. 2015; Breunig et al. 2011; Houborg et 
al. 2016; Lamparelli et al. 2012; Moharana and Dutta 2016; Pan 
et al. 2013; Sonmez and Slater 2016; Thenkabail et al. 2013). EO-1 
acquired over 70 000 images of the Earth from the year 2001 through 
2015 in 242 narrow spectral bands in the 400–2500 nm spectral range 
(Aneece and Thenkabail 2018). This acquisition was a quantum leap 
in spectral data relative to multispectral broadband data acquired 
in a few broad bands such as from Landsat, Moderate Resolution 
Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Satellite pour l’Observation de 
la Terre (SPOT), and the Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) series of satel-
lites (Mariotto et al. 2013; Marshall and Thenkabail 2015). However, 
the recent launch of advanced spaceborne hyperspectral sensors such 
as the Italian PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa 
(PRISMA) and the German Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt 
(DLR) Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer (DESIS) onboard the 
International Space Station (ISS) has opened up a new dimension in 
remote sensing by offering hundreds of hyperspectral narrowbands 
(HNB) along the electromagnetic spectrum (Heiden et al. 2019; Loizzo 
et al. 2016; Lu et al. 2020). PRISMA acquires data from 400 to 2500 
nm and DESIS from 400 to 1000 nm (Table 1) and both acquire data 
as near-continuous HNB, generating a “spectral signature” rather 
than a few “data points” as acquired by broadband sensors (Heiden 
et al. 2019; Loizzo et al. 2016). In addition, a number of spaceborne 
hyperspectral sensors were recently launched, such as Germany’s 
Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) (EnMAP 
2022), or planned for launch in the coming years, such as the United 
States’ National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Surface 
Biology and Geology (SBG) mission (SBG 2022).

DESIS Hyperspectral Data
The German Aerospace Center (formerly DLR) partnered with 
Teledyne Brown Engineering to design the DLR Earth Sensing Imaging 
Spectrometer (DESIS) (Heiden et al. 2019; Krutz et al. 2019; Peschel 
et al. 2018). It is mounted on the Multi-User System for Earth Sensing 
(MUSES) platform on the International Space Station (ISS) (Heiden et al. 
2019). Since the sensor is mounted on the ISS, its coverage depends on 
the overpasses of the ISS which has a non–sun-synchronous and varied 
orbit, with no repeat cycle (Heiden et al. 2019). Despite the challenges 
of the variable orbit and collection environments, the cost-savings of 
mounting DESIS on the ISS are substantial (Krutz et al. 2019). Since it 
is unable to point at the sun, moon, or deep space for calibration, DESIS 
has in-orbit spectral calibration and in-orbit radiometric calibration 
(Krutz et al. 2019). Because of the push broom mechanism, DESIS 
data are affected by a low smile effect of 1.7 pixels and an even lower 
keystone effect of 0.3 pixel across the entire field of view and spectral 
range (Krutz et al. 2019). For details on smile, keystone, striping, and 
rolling shutter corrections, refer to Alonso et al. (2019).
DESIS has 235 bands along a spectral range from 400 nm to 1000 
nm (Heiden et al. 2019; Krutz et al. 2019). It has a spectral resolution of

2.55 nm with Full Width Half Maximum of approximately 3.5 nm, and a 
radiometric resolution of 13 bits (Alonso et al. 2019; Heiden et al. 2019). Its 
spatial resolution is 30 m, with a 30 km swath at 400 km altitude (Heiden et 
al. 2019). The signal to noise ratio (SNR) varies by band, but at 550 nm the 
SNR is 205 without binning and 406 at 4 bin (Heiden et al. 2019).
DESIS data are now available through Teledyne, in several levels 
of processing (Heiden et al. 2019). The Level 0 product consists of 
raw data (Heiden et al. 2019). The Level 1A product consists of tiled 
images, a browse image, metadata, and quality flags (Heiden et al. 
2019). The Level 1B product consists of top of atmosphere (TOA) 
radiance, with systematic and radiometric corrections including those 
for the rolling shutter and the smile effect (Heiden et al. 2019). The 
Level 1C product has orthorectified, georeferenced TOA data (Heiden 
et al. 2019). Finally, the Level 2A (L2A) data are atmospherically cor-
rected to ground surface reflectance, available with and without terrain 
correction (Heiden et al. 2019). Atmospheric correction is conducted 
using the DLR’s Python Atmospheric Correction algorithm, based on 
the Atmospheric and Topographic Correction algorithm (Alonso et al. 
2019). The L2A data include masks for water, land, cloud, shadow, 
snow, haze, aerosol optical thickness, and water vapor (Alonso et al. 
2019). Products are available in four spectral binning configurations: 
x1, x2, x3, and x4, resulting in the spectral resolutions of 2.55 nm, 5.1 
nm, 7.65 nm, and 10.2 nm, respectively (Alonso et al. 2019).
PRISMA Hyperspectral Data
The Italian Space Agency’s (ASI) PRecursore IperSpettrale della 
Missione Applicativa (PRISMA) satellite was launched in 2019 and is 
in sun-synchronous low-Earth orbit at an altitude of 615 to 620 km 
(Loizzo et al. 2016). Details about the sensor design can be found in 
Labate et al. (2009); Loizzo et al. (2016); Pignatti et al. (2015, 2013). 
PRISMA’s on-board radiometric calibration system includes absolute 
calibration using the sun, relative calibration using two tungsten 
lamps, dark calibration using a shutter slit, and on-demand calibration 
using flat-field calibration and lunar observation (Pignatti et al. 2013). 
Stripes are removed using non-local means (Pignatti et al. 2015). 
Smile and keystone effects also exist, but errors are within 10% of a 
pixel (Labate et al. 2009). Clouds are detected using a discriminant 
analysis algorithm trained using Hyperion data (Pignatti et al. 2015). 
Atmospheric correction is done using a method similar to Moderate 
Resolution Atmospheric Transmission (Berk et al. 2008), a simplified 
radiative transfer equation, and a digital elevation model; for more de-
tail on these pre-processing steps, please refer to Pignatti et al. (2015).
PRISMA collects data at 66 visible to near infrared (VNIR) bands 
from 400 to 1010 nm and 171 short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands from 
920 to 2500 nm, at 10–12 nm spectral resolution (Loizzo et al. 2016; 
Pignatti et al. 2013). VNIR data are collected using a silicon-based 
detector, while SWIR data are collected using a mercury cadmium tel-
luride diode array (Pignatti et al. 2013). In addition, PRISMA collects 
one panchromatic (PAN) band from 400 to 750 nm (Pignatti et al. 
2013). The VNIR-SWIR imaging spectrometer and PAN camera are opti-
cally integrated to enable hyperspectral and panchromatic data fusion 
(Loizzo et al. 2016; Pignatti et al. 2015). Radiometric resolution is 
12 bit, the swath width is 30 km, and the ground sampling distance is 
30 m for VNIR-SWIR and 5 m for PAN (Loizzo et al. 2016). The SNR is 
greater than 200:1 in the 400 to 1750 nm range, and 100:1 at the 1950 
to 2350 nm range (Loizzo et al. 2016). The PAN SNR is greater than 
240:1 (Loizzo et al. 2016).
PRISMA data are available in several levels of processing (Loizzo 
et al. 2016). Level 0 consists of raw data with appended metadata 
(Loizzo et al. 2016). Level 1 consists of radiometrically corrected and 
calibrated top-of-atmosphere radiance, with masks for clouds, sun-
glint, and general classification (Loizzo et al. 2016). Level 2b consists 
of geolocated surface radiance (Loizzo et al. 2016). Level 2c consists 
of surface reflectance, with aerosol and water vapor products and cloud 
masks (Loizzo et al. 2016). Lastly, Level 2d consists of geocoded 
surface reflectance (Loizzo et al. 2016). ASI also plans to add subse-
quent product levels with geophysical, geochemical, biophysical, and 
biochemical characteristics (Loizzo et al. 2016).
Understanding the characteristics of these sensors is of great im-
portance to advance science applications within and between sensors, 
especially when integrating data from multiple hyperspectral sensors 
that will become available in the coming years. How do the spectral 
signatures of these multiple hyperspectral sensors compare with each 
other? What are their inter-relationships? How do they characterize 
different applications? What advances do they offer? These are relevant 
questions for which scientifically sound answers will allow full use of 
the new generation of hyperspectral data.
Hyperspectral Remote Sensing of Agriculture
Hyperspectral data provide several advantages over multispectral 
data in the study of agricultural crops because they provide informa-
tion in hundreds of near-continuous bands along the electromagnetic 
spectrum; in contrast, multispectral data provide information in only 
a few broad spectral bands (Aneece and Thenkabail 2018; Kennedy 
et al. 2020; Lu et al. 2020; Thenkabail et al. 2021). HNB significantly 
improve classification accuracies of crop types, modeling of crop 
biochemical and biophysical characteristics, and assessment of other 
factors such as plant health and stress (Lu et al. 2020; Mariotto et al. 
2013; Marshall et al. 2016; Thenkabail et al. 2018a, 2018b, 2018c, 
2018d; Vali et al. 2020).
An extensive study of agricultural crops using hyperspectral remote 
sensing of old generation sensors has been documented in a four-volume 
book on the hyperspectral remote sensing of vegetation (Thenkabail et 
al. 2018a, 2018b, 2018c, 2018d). Many hyperspectral studies have been 
conducted using hand-held, truck-mounted, or airborne hyperspectral 
sensors. For example, several researchers have used airborne hyperspec-
tral data to study agriculture (Feng et al. 2020; Nigam et al. 2019; Oki 
et al. 2006; Sahadevan 2021; Salas and Subburayalu 2019; Salas et al. 
2020; Yang et al. 2021) However, these data may be more cost-prohibi-
tive and/or more limited in spatial extent than satellite data. The first-of-
its-kind NASA-built EO-1 Hyperion hyperspectral spaceborne sensor col-
lected over 70 000 images across the world from 2001 to 2017 (Aneece 
and Thenkabail 2018). It was used for various agricultural applications 
like classification of crop residue, crop types and varieties, and crop 
conditions (Aneece and Thenkabail 2021; Bannari et al. 2015; Bhojaraja 
et al. 2015; Breunig et al. 2011; Lamparelli et al. 2012; Pan et al. 2013; 
Sonmez and Slater 2016) and for estimating tillage intensity and crop 
characteristics (Houborg et al. 2016; Mariotto et al. 2013; Marshall and 
Thenkabail 2015; Moharana and Dutta 2016; Sonmez and Slater 2016; 
Thenkabail et al. 2013), but has now been decommissioned.
We are now entering a new era of hyperspectral remote sensing with 
the launch of DESIS onboard ISS in 2018 and the polar-orbiting PRISMA 
in 2019. A few recent studies have used DESIS (Aneece and Thenkabail 
2021) or PRISMA (Cogliati et al. 2021; Pepe et al. 2020) data to study 
agriculture. A few have also compared the two for geological (Tripathi 
and Garg 2021) and aquatic ecosystem applications (Bresciani et al. 
2022). However, this is one of the first studies, alongside Hank et al. 
(2021), that compares the performance of DESIS and PRISMA in classify-
ing agricultural crops. The differences in the bandwidths and spectral 
ranges of these sensors influence their use in various agricultural 
applications. In addition, these sensors are precursors to the recently 
launched German hyperspectral sensor Environmental Mapping and 
Analysis Program (EnMAP) and upcoming hyperspectral sensors like 
NASA’s Surface Biology and Geology (SBG) mission. Thus, the study of 
these sensors will be invaluable once data from EnMAP, SBG, and others 
become available. One of the major advances of this study was building 
spectral libraries of major agricultural crops from these new generation 
sensors. Such libraries are important reference training and validation 
data for machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence 
model development (Thenkabail et al. 2019). These models will in 
turn enable classification of crop types, estimation of biophysical and 
biochemical characteristics, and assessment of crop health and stress.
Overarching Goal and Objectives
The goal of this research was to study the characteristics of two new 
generation spaceborne hyperspectral sensors: DESIS and PRISMA. Two 
DESIS and one PRISMA images acquired during the 2020 growing 
season were used to classify seven major crops (almonds, corn, cotton, 
grapes, pistachios, rice, and tomatoes) in a study area located in the 
Central Valley of California, USA. Specific objectives were to:

Materials and Methods
Study Area
The study area is in the Central Valley of California, in north-central 
California (Figure 1). This area was selected due to the presence of 
several crop types in a small area that could be captured by DESIS and 
PRISMA image footprints, its significance in national food security, 
and image availability. We focused on almonds, corn, cotton, grapes, 
pistachios, rice, and tomatoes because these were most prevalent in 
the study area and/or are globally major crops. Planting and harvesting 
dates for these crops vary by year and farm. For example, corn is plant-
ed around May 15th and harvested around October 15th, but those dates 
can vary by plus or minus 1.5 months (Sacks et al. 2010). Similarly, 
cotton is planted around April 20th and harvested around October 25th 
and rice is planted around May 15th and harvested around October 
10th, but these dates vary by plus or minus one month (Sacks et al. 
2010). Tomatoes are planted around April 1st and harvested before the 
first frost around December 1st (California Grown, 2022). Almonds, 
pistachios, and grapevines grow throughout the year. Almonds are 
harvested August through November, pistachios September through 
November, and grapes July through November (CUESA, 2022). Below, 
we describe the hyperspectral data acquired for this study area (Figure 
1), followed by reference and validation data.
Data
The goal of this research was to compare two new generation sensors 
(DESIS and PRISMA), both of which need to be tasked for acquiring 
data rather than providing wall-to-wall coverage as do satellites like 
Landsat. Getting images over the same area on the same or similar 
dates is extremely difficult. A study of this nature, however, requires 
acquisitions on the same or similar dates to build a valid comparison. 
We were able to achieve this for our study area by acquiring data 
from DESIS onboard the ISS and PRISMA, a polar-orbiting satellite, by 
tasking them. Both satellites acquired some images for the study area; 
we reviewed them and selected those of good quality, similar dates of 
acquisition within the growing season, and with overlapping footprints. 
Therefore, three hyperspectral images over the study area were select-
ed with which we were able to compare DESIS and PRISMA images for 
similar dates, and DESIS June with DESIS August images to assess crops 
in different growth stages. The two DESIS images were acquired in 
clear conditions on June 18, 2020, and August 8, 2020, downloaded as 
Level 2a, surface reflectance products from DLR and Teledyne Brown 
(German Aerospace Center (formerly DLR) and Teledyne Brown 2022). 
The PRISMA image with less than 11.5% cloud cover was acquired 
on June 17, 2020 and downloaded as a Level 2D surface reflectance 
product from the PRISMA data portal made available by the ASI (Italian 
Space Agency (ASI) 2022).
The United States Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural 
Statistics Service Cropland Data Layer (USDA NASS CDL) (USDA 
National Agricultural Statistics Service Cropland Data Layer 2022) was 
used as reference data because it consists of yearly wall-to-wall crop 
type data for the USA. The USDA NASS CDL has relatively high clas-
sification accuracies for the selected study crops in the study site (Table 
2; USDA NASS 2022) and has been used frequently in research for refer-
ence (Boryan and Yang 2021; Hao et al. 2016; Lark et al. 2021; Zhang 
et al. 2021a; Zhong et al. 2014). As seen in Table 2, all study crops 
except for corn and grapes have high producer’s (87.9%–97.7%), user’s 
(82.7%–99.1%) accuracies, and Kappa values (0.876–0.975) (USDA 
NASS 2022). While lower than the others, corn and grapes also have 
relatively high producer’s accuracies (74.8% and 77.7%, respectively), 
user’s accuracies (80.5% and 71.2%, respectively) accuracies, and 
Kappa values (0.744 and 0.774, respectively) (USDA NASS 2022) These 
two crop types also covered less area than the other study crop types. 
Thus, we used the high-quality USDA NASS CDL data for reference.
Because the three images had a slight spatial misalignment, we 
georeferenced them to the USDA NASS CDL in ArcGIS (Version 10.8.1; 
ESRI 2022) to ensure sampling at the same location across images. The 
image footprints had enough overlap to select samples across all three 
images. Sampling was done by generating random points within the 
overlapping area with a minimum distance of 100 m to avoid autocor-
relation and extracting data from all three images. This sampling was 
also done in ArcGIS (Version 10.8.1; ESRI 2022).
In addition to extracting crop type data (illustrated in Figure 2), con-
fidence information was also extracted from the USDA NASS CDL (USDA 
National Agricultural Statistics Service Cropland Data Layer 2022). The 
random samples were then filtered based on confidence, crop type (only 
retaining study crops), and spectral quality (Table 3). We retained only 
samples with confidence levels of at least 70%. A lower threshold allowed 
the introduction of noise and a higher threshold impeded adequate sample 
size. Fields with double-cropping were excluded to ensure spectral

signatures were as pure as possible. Data used in this study are available 
through the ScienceBase Catalog (Aneece and Thenkabail 2022).
Sensor Comparisons
Spectral libraries were used to generate correlation plots in R (Version 
4.0.4; R Core Team 2018) using the ggplot2 package (Version 3.3.5; 
Wickham 2016) comparing DESIS and PRISMA June spectral reflectanc-
es at various wavelength ranges: 400 to 1000 nm, 400 to 699 nm, 700 
to 759 nm, 760 to 899 nm, and 900 to 1000 nm. Correlation analysis 
was done within and across crop types. Since only June PRISMA data 
were available, only June DESIS data were included in this analysis. To 
establish a fair comparison, broader DESIS bands were simulated by 
averaging across five bands to approximate PRISMA bandwidths. Linear 
models were determined in R (Version 4.0.4; R Core Team 2018) using 
the ggpmisc package (Aphalo 2020). Band averaging was only done 
for these correlation analyses, not for the optimal band selection or 
classification analyses described below.
Optimal Bands
Many methods for band selection exist, including principal component 
analyses, lambda-by-lambda plots, and stepwise-regression (Aneece 
and Thenkabail 2021; Mariotto et al. 2013; Marshall et al. 2016). In this 
study, we selected optimal HNB for DESIS and PRISMA data using peak and 
trough detection, which has successfully been used for finding features 
in other remote sensing applications (Ali and Clausi 2001; Kutser et al. 
2016; Zarco-Tejada et al. 2003). First, peaks and troughs were determined 
by comparing the reflectance of a band with the reflectances of bands 
immediately before and immediately after it. This comparison was done 
separately for each hyperspectral image and each crop type. We counted 
the number of times each peak or trough wavelength was detected by 
month and crop type. The most frequently detected wavelengths across 
images and crop types, which represented consistent patterns at specific 
locations of the spectrum, were selected for future analysis. Frequencies 
varied by month and crop type; thus, a single threshold value could not 
be used. To determine the most important bands for DESIS analysis, we 
pooled June and August data. Since PRISMA data were only available for 
June, these were used to determine the most important bands.
Classification Algorithms
The support vector machine supervised classification algorithm was 
selected to classify crop types and compare classification accuracies 
across sensors. This algorithm has been used successfully for hyper-
spectral (including DESIS) analysis (Aneece and Thenkabail 2021; 
Gopinath et al. 2020; Lin and Yan 2016; Praveen et al. 2016; Puletti 
et al. 2016; Rodriguez-Galiano et al. 2015), and has outperformed 
random forest for hyperspectral crop classification (Aneece and 
Thenkabail 2018, 2021) The linear kernel produced higher accuracies 
than the more commonly used radial basis function kernel and was 
thus selected for this analysis.
To compare the abilities of DESIS and PRISMA data to classify agricul-
tural crop types, we conducted classification analyses using the following:
1.	 26 DESIS bands at 2.55 nm from 400 to 1000 nm
2.	 25 PRISMA bands at ≤12 nm from 400 to 1000 nm
3.	 45 PRISMA bands at ≤12 nm from 400 to 2500 nm
Classification comparisons using the first and second data sets 
would help detect any benefits the narrower DESIS bands may provide 
over the relatively broader PRISMA bands. A comparison between 
results using the second and third data sets would help detect the ad-
vantages of including SWIR data in classification of these crop types.
Vegetation Indices
PRISMA OHNB were used to adapt vegetation indices found in litera-
ture based on narrowbands available in PRISMA data, the optimal band 
analysis in this study, and extensive literature review (Carter 1994; 
Clevers 2014; Daughtry 2001; Giovos et al. 2021; Gitelson et al. 2006, 
2001, 2002; Hatfield et al. 2019; Hunt et al. 2013; Kandylakis and 
Karantzalos 2016; Kior et al. 2021; Lichtenthaler et al. 1996; Poley and 
McDermid 2020; Roberts et al. 2018; Segarra et al. 2020; Serrano et al. 
2002; Vogelmann et al. 1993; Wang and Qu 2007; Zarco-Tejada et al. 
2005; Zhang et al. 2021b). OHNB were also used to build hyperspectral 
two-band vegetation indices (HTBVI), which may be used to estimate 
crop characteristics such as plant pigment content, biomass, stress, 
and moisture. The HTBVI can be calculated using Equation 1, where 
Rλ1 and Rλ2 are percent surface reflectances at wavelengths λ1 and λ2, 
respectively.

Results
Sensor Comparisons
As shown in Figure 3, PRISMA and DESIS data in the early growing 
season (June) had similarly shaped spectral profiles of crops in early 
vegetative growth. However, PRISMA average reflectances were higher 
than DESIS for all crops in the visible range, and for most crops in the 
near-infrared (NIR) range. In contrast, the NIR reflectances for corn and 
rice were higher in DESIS data than PRISMA. Additionally, the shapes of 
the spectral profiles in the water absorption trough from 900 to 1000 
nm differed between sensors. Average PRISMA spectral profiles were 
also smoother than DESIS profiles due to wider bands.
When comparing the two DESIS images, one in June and one in 
August, the August reflectances were higher than June reflectances 
as would be expected later in the growing season (Figure 4). Also as 
expected, the green peaks, red troughs, and water absorption features 
(from plant moisture) were more prominent later in the growing sea-
son. Subtle spectral features in the red (600 to 670 nm) and NIR (800 to 
900 nm) ranges were also more prominent in August spectra.

In addition to the visual comparisons described below, linear cor-
relation analyses were run between PRISMA and DESIS June spectra 
(Figure 5 and Table 4). When considering the entire 400 to 1000 nm 
spectral range, R2 values ranged from 0.90 to 0.95 across crop types. 
Correlations were also strong in the 700 to 759 nm range, with R2 val-
ues of 0.77 to 0.94. In contrast, correlations were relatively weak in the 
400 to 699 nm range, with R2 values of 0.11 to 0.44 across crop types, 
as well as in the 900 to 1000 nm range, with R2 values of 0.12 to 0.49 
for all crops except rice (R2 0.81). Finally, R2 values varied from 0.40 
to 0.83 in the 760 to 899 nm range.
Optimal Bands
Out of the 235 DESIS bands in the 400 to 1000 nm range, 26 bands 
(11%) were selected for further analysis, as illustrated in Figure 6 
and Table 5. These band center wavelengths have been found useful 
for various agricultural applications (Aneece and Thenkabail 2021; 
Mariotto et al. 2013; Thenkabail 2015; Thenkabail et al. 2021, 2014) 
including crop type and growth stage classification, disease and stress 
detection, estimation of biochemical properties such as nitrogen,

pigment, protein, and moisture content, and biophysical properties 
such as biomass/yield (sometimes estimated using Leaf Area Index 
(LAI)), and vegetation vigor.
Out of the 238 PRISMA bands from 400 to 2500 nm, 45 bands 
(19%) were selected as optimal for agricultural studies, as illustrated 
in Figures 7 and 8 and listed in Table 6 (see page 723). As with the se-
lected DESIS bands, these bands have been used for differentiating crop 
and vegetation types, their growth stages, weeds, and diseased and 
stressed plants, for estimating crop biomass/yield (and LAI), nitrogen, 
protein, pigment, water, starch, sugar, cellulose, and lignin content, 
and for assessing Light Use Efficiency (LUE) (Aneece and Thenkabail 
2018, 2021; Delalieux et al. 2007; Mariotto et al. 2013; Thenkabail 
et al. 2021). Of the selected 45 bands, 25 are within the 400 to 1000 
nm range, almost the same number of bands selected from DESIS data 
along the same spectral range.
Classification Accuracies
The selected OHNB of DESIS and PRISMA in the 400 to 1000 nm range 
achieved the best results in classifying the seven agricultural crops, 
with the higher PRISMA overall accuracy of 90% compared to the DESIS

overall accuracy of 83% (Table 7). Producer’s accuracies for PRISMA 
ranged from 72–100%, while user’s accuracies ranged from 80–100%. 
Those for DESIS ranged from 63–100% and 67–100%, respectively. 
Especially of note are the much lower user’s accuracy for almonds 
and producer’s accuracy for grapes using DESIS data, caused by grape 
spectra being misclassified as almonds. This may be due to the spectral 
similarities of the two for DESIS data, and due to the small area of 
grapes and large area of almonds in the study area.
However, including PRISMA bands beyond 1000 nm did not result 
in increased classification accuracies, with an overall accuracy of 89% 
compared to 90% using only bands from 400 to 1000 nm (Table 7). 
Using all bands resulted in producer’s accuracies of 72–100% and 
user’s accuracies of 73–100%. However, the bands beyond 1000 nm 
are useful for estimating specific crop biophysical and biochemical 
properties (Giovos et al. 2021; Hatfield et al. 2019; Kior et al. 2021; 
Roberts et al. 2018).
Vegetation Indices
Since classification accuracies were higher using PRISMA OHNB than 
when using DESIS OHNB, we focused on using PRISMA bands to build 
vegetation indices. Out of numerous existing vegetation indices, we 
selected some of the commonly used indices to estimate plant biomass/
density/yield; nitrogen, pigment, moisture, and structural content; and 
stress (Table 8, see page 724). These were adapted to PRISMA data 
considering bands used in literature review and spectral features seen 
in PRISMA data. In addition to adapting existing vegetation indices, we 
have suggested HTBVI that may be useful for estimating such biophysi-
cal and biochemical characteristics as plant pigment, stress, biomass, 
moisture, and cellulose/lignin (Table 9).
Discussion
In this paper, we compared data from the new generation hyperspectral 
sensors PRISMA and DESIS using two DESIS images and one PRISMA im-
age in the growing season of 2020 in the Central Valley of California, 
USA. We developed spectral libraries for each sensor for seven major

agricultural crops (almonds, corn, cotton, grapes, pistachios, rice, and 
tomatoes). These spectral libraries were used to compare DESIS and 
PRISMA data characteristics. DESIS data, with narrower bands, had more 
spectral features (peaks and troughs) than did PRISMA data. However, 
given the lower classification accuracies using DESIS data, these 
spectral features may be more noise than information. This perfor-
mance can be attributed to the issues of sensor SNR related to the very 
narrow spectral bandwidth of 2.55 nm in DESIS. It has been observed 
that the signal in the visible portion of the spectrum (400–700 nm) in 
DESIS is low and the noise in the 760–1000 nm range is high. There 
is also an issue of overcorrection in DESIS or a sensor-related issue 
where we have noticed a number of bands with zero reflectivity in the 
400–700 nm range. Very narrow bands have high SNR when data are 
collected from the ground using a spectroradiometer. However, when 
collected from spaceborne sensors, SNR can be low for very narrow 
bands such as the 2.55 nm of DESIS relative to the slightly broader ≤12 
nm of PRISMA. Field data are needed to determine optimal bandwidths. 
Thus, when conducting inter-sensor comparisons, differences in sensor 
characteristics (e.g., bandwidth) and in data preprocessing (e.g., atmo-
spheric correction) need to be kept in mind.
DESIS and PRISMA spectral libraries were used to determine OHNB 
for each sensor, retaining 11–19% non-redundant hyperspectral data. 
This percentage of unique information retained is consistent with other 
hyperspectral literature (Aneece and Thenkabail 2021; Mariotto et al. 
2013; Marshall et al. 2016; Thenkabail et al. 2021). Some spectral fea-
tures seen in DESIS and PRISMA data may be sensor or detector artifacts, 
or products of the atmospheric correction methods used. For example, 
the peak at 771 nm in PRISMA data may be influenced by correction of 
the oxygen absorption feature. The peaks observed in the NIR region, 
especially in the water absorption feature from 910 to 1000 nm, may 
be influenced by the low SNR in that spectral range. Determining the 
level of signal versus noise and artifacts will allow us to evaluate the 
extrapolability of these results in other areas and using other sensors.
Further, the selected features and corresponding OHNB fall in 
regions of the spectral profile correlated with plant characteristics 
as determined in agricultural remote sensing literature (Aneece and 
Thenkabail 2018, 2021; Chen et al. 2020; Clevers 2014; Delalieux et 
al. 2007; Deng et al. 2020; Hatfield et al. 2019; Hennessy et al. 2020; 
Ma et al. 2019; Mariotto et al. 2013; Mobasheri and Rahimzadegan 
2012; Mudereri et al. 2020; Ren et al. 2020; Roberts et al. 2018; Salem 
et al. 2017; Serrano et al. 2002; Singh et al. 2022; Thenkabail 2015; 
Thenkabail et al. 2021, 2014; Zhang et al. 2018). These OHNB were 
able to differentiate the seven crop types. The overall accuracies were 
higher for PRISMA (90%) than for DESIS (83%) in the 400 to 1000 nm 
range. Using the PRISMA OHNB from 400 to 1000 nm, we obtained pro-
ducer’s accuracies of 72 to 100% and user’s accuracies of 80 to 100%. 
These accuracies were obtained using the support vector machine 
classification algorithm. Higher accuracies may be obtained using deep 
learning algorithms (Raczko and Zagajewski 2017). Bands beyond 
1000 nm in PRISMA did not result in increased accuracies. However, 
these bands will likely improve results in studies pertaining to crop 
biophysical/biochemical properties.
Lastly, PRISMA narrowbands were used to adapt vegetation indices 
for estimation of various plant characteristics including pigment 
content, stress, biomass, and cellulose/lignin content (Table 8). For 
example, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has 
been used in many studies to estimate vegetation growth and health. 
However, it has issues of saturation in areas with high amounts of 
vegetation and can be influenced by soil and atmosphere (Roberts 
et al. 2018). The Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index 
(GNDVI) is similar to NDVI, but more sensitive to chlorophyll content 
(Kior et al. 2021). The Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and the 
Atmospherically-Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI) minimize influence 
from soil properties and atmospheric conditions respectively (Roberts 
et al. 2018). The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) also includes cor-
rections for differences in soil properties and atmospheric conditions 
and is less susceptible to problems of saturation (Roberts et al. 2018).
Many indices also exist for estimating nitrogen and pigment 
content. Nitrogen is used by plants for building pigments and proteins, 
influencing the spectral profile throughout the spectral range. The 
Normalized Difference Nitrogen Index (NDNI) compares the nitrogen 
absorbance around 1510 nm with the non-absorbing region around 
1680 nm (Roberts et al. 2018). However, nitrogen estimation can be 
challenging because absorption features around 1500 and 2180 nm are 
masked by water absorption features in healthy plants (Clevers 2014).
Several chlorophyll indices use the chlorophyll absorption band 
around 670 nm and the green peak around 550 nm. For example, 
the Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index (CARI) compares 
the reflectance around 670 nm with reflectance in the red (R) region, 
around 700 nm. The modified CARI (MCARI) includes a ratio between 
the NIR and R regions to compensate for soil (Roberts et al. 2018). 
The Triangular Greenness Index (TGI) allows for estimation of chlo-
rophyll without the need for a red-edge band; it instead uses reflec-
tances around 670, 550, and 480 nm (Hunt et al. 2013). Similarly, the 
Triangular Vegetation Index (TVI) uses reflectances around 670, 550, 
and 750 nm to form a triangle to estimate chlorophyll and LAI (Hunt 
et al. 2013; Kior et al. 2021). The Normalized Pigment Chlorophyll 
Index (NPCI) estimates the ratio of total pigments to chlorophyll and 
can be used to assess plant stress (Penuelas et al. 1994). Carotenoids 
play a role in photosynthesis and the protection of chlorophyll from 
photooxidation (Gitelson et al. 2006; Roberts et al. 2018). Both chlo-
rophylls and carotenoids influence spectral reflectances in the green 
region. Thus, bands to estimate concentrations of individual pigment 
types need to use bands that are influenced only by one pigment type, 
as done by Gitelson et al. (2006) and Blackburn (1998) to estimate 
carotenoid content. Carotenoids are most easily detected during plant 
senescence, when chlorophyll breaks down while carotenoids are 
still intact (Roberts et al. 2018). Similarly, anthocyanins also play a 
role during periods of stress, and are thought to reduce photoinhibi-
tion (Roberts et al. 2018). Leaves have a reddish color when high in 
anthocyanin content. The Anthocyanin Reflectance Index (ARI) takes 
the difference between the reciprocals of the green and red-edge re-
flectances. ARI-2 refines the estimation by adding a weighting through 
NIR reflectance (Roberts et al. 2018). The Anthocyanin Content Index 
uses the ratio between green and NIR reflectances to measure the drop 
in green leaf reflectance with increasing anthocyanin content (Roberts 
et al. 2018).
For estimating plant moisture/water content, the Normalized 
Difference Water Index (NDWI) compares reflectance values around 
860 and 1240 nm to estimate plant moisture while minimizing atmo-
spheric influences (Kior et al. 2021). The Water Index, also called the 
Water Band Index, compares reflectances at 900 and 970 nm to detect 
the amount of water absorption and estimate plant moisture (Roberts 
et al. 2018). To estimate cellulose content, the Cellulose Absorption 
Index (CAI) uses the cellulose absorption band around 2101 nm and 
surrounding bands outside of the absorption feature (Roberts et al. 
2018). Similarly, the Normalized Difference Lignin Index (NDLI) com-
pares reflectance at the lignin absorption band around 1754 nm with 
the non-absorbing region around 1680 nm (Roberts et al. 2018).
As plants face several stressors, there are many indices used to 
estimate plant stress. The Moisture Stress Index (MSI) compares 
reflectance at the water absorption band around 1650 nm with NIR 
reflectance (either around 830 nm or 927 nm) (Roberts et al. 2018). 
The Carter Index 1 (Ctr1) uses reflectances around 695 and 420 nm to 
estimate stress regardless of the stressor (Carter 1994). Similarly, the 
Lichtenthaler Index 2 (Lic2) uses reflectances around 695 and 440 nm 
to detect inhibition of photosynthesis and stress (Lichtenthaler et al. 
1996). The Photochemical Reflectance Index measures the decrease 
in reflectance at 531 nm by comparing it with reflectance at 570 nm 
(Roberts et al. 2018). This decrease can be used to estimate plant stress 
or carotenoid content (Roberts et al. 2018). The Shortwave Infrared 
Water Stress Index (SIWSI) uses reflectances around 860 and 1650 nm 
to detect water stress (Hatfield et al. 2019). The Vogelmann Index 2 
uses red edge bands to detect low chlorophyll levels and estimate stress 
(Giovos et al. 2021; Vogelmann et al. 1993). Finally, the Normalized

Multi-Band Drought Index (NMDI) uses the water absorption bands 
around 860, 1640, and 2130 nm (MODIS bands 2, 6, and 7, respectively) 
to estimate plant and soil moisture to assess drought stress (Wang and 
Qu 2007).
These existing vegetation indices were adapted to PRISMA data con-
sidering available bands, spectral features seen in the spectral libraries, 
and PRISMA OHNB. The bands included in these indices sometimes 
differ from those in literature because of differences in bandwidths 
across sensors. For example, the NMDI was built using available MODIS 
bands, but may benefit from using narrower PRISMA bands like those 
recommended here. The recommended bands are also sometimes 
adjusted to take into account PRISMA spectral features. For example, 
550 nm is often used to represent the green band. Here, we found the 
green peak most often occurred at 555 nm, and thus recommended this 
to be used (Table 8). Index parameters also needed to be adjusted when 
adjusting bands in certain indices. For example, the values of 228 and 
115 in the TGI represent differences between band values (i.e., 670 – 
442 = 228 and 670 – 555 = 115). A similar adjustment was made to the 
TVI. In cases where very broad spectral regions were indicated in the 
equations (e.g., NIR/R), we used literature review and PRISMA features/
OHNB to recommend narrowbands. Further exploration, especially in 
conjunction with field measurements, will help further refine these 
recommendations.
In addition to adapting existing vegetation indices, we suggested 
HTBVI that may be used to estimate various plant biophysical and bio-
chemical characteristics using PRISMA narrowbands (Table 9). Using 
the existing knowledge-base (for example Thenkabail et al. (2018a, 
2018b, 2018c, 2018d)), we have attempted to define spectral bands 
of importance considering various peaks and troughs throughout the 
electromagnetic spectrum. These important peaks and troughs were 
determined based on their consistent occurrence and patterns observed 
across crop types and dates using large sample sizes and literature 
review. Regardless, further research, alongside field-observed data, 
will allow each of these HTBVI to be specifically linked to a particular 
biochemical or biophysical characteristic. These suggested indices are 
meant to serve as a pathway for further research.
The DESIS and PRISMA spectral libraries developed here along-
side others in the Global Hyperspectral Imaging Spectral-libraries of 
Agricultural crops (GHISA) project (Thenkabail et al. 2019), will fa-
cilitate development and automated deployment of crop type machine/
deep learning classification algorithms. In addition, such inter-sensor 
comparisons at overlapping study areas and time-periods are cru-
cial for future workflows taking advantage of these and upcoming 
hyperspectral sensors for crop type mapping and crop productivity 
estimations.
Of course, there is much work to be done. Our goal for this study 
was to assess any advantages that would be provided by the narrower 
DESIS bands; however, future work could include comparing clas-
sification accuracies using the various binned DESIS products. It also 
includes testing of the adapted VI and suggested HTBVI with ground 
measurements of plant characteristics. Additionally, small spectral 
features from DESIS data need to be examined alongside field data to 
determine whether they encompass noise or information. These sensor 
comparisons could be furthered by adding future sensors such as the 
recently launched German EnMAP and upcoming US NASA SBG sensors. 
The data from these future sensors will also increase image availability 
for time-series classification analyses.
Conclusions
DESIS and PRISMA new generation spaceborne hyperspectral sensors 
were used to develop spectral libraries of seven agricultural crops 
(almonds, corn, cotton, grapes, pistachios, rice, and tomatoes) in the 
Central Valley of California, USA for the growing season of 2020. 
Inter-sensor comparisons of these two hyperspectral sensors indicated 
high correlations with R2 values of 0.90–0.95. The study established 
26 DESIS optimal hyperspectral narrow bands (OHNB) (11% of the 235 
DESIS HNB from 400 to 1000 nm) and 45 PRISMA OHNB (19% of the 
238 PRISMA HNB from 400 to 2500 nm) for the study of agricultural 
crops. The rest (89% of DESIS and 81% of PRISMA) of the bands were 
found to be redundant. The seven agricultural crops were classified 
with overall accuracies of 83–90% using these OHNB. Producer’s ac-
curacies of individual crop types for PRISMA ranged from 72 to 100% 
whereas those for DESIS ranged from 63 to 100%. User’s accuracies of 
individual crop types for PRISMA ranged from 80 to 100% while those 
from DESIS ranged from 67 to 100%. Overall, PRISMA yielded sub-
stantially higher classification accuracies as a result of higher signal to 
noise ratio. HNB have shown great advances in the study of agricultural 
crops and vegetation. However, this study indicates there is an optimal 
bandwidth for spaceborne sensors below which SNR ratio decreases. 
Here, the ≤12 nm bandwidth of PRISMA provided more signal and less 
noise than the 2.55 nm bandwidth of DESIS. Finally, based on literature 
review and these OHNB, we developed hyperspectral two-band vegeta-
tion indices and adapted existing vegetation indices for PRISMA bands 
to estimate plant pigment content, plant stress, wet and dry biomass, 
plant water/moisture content, and cellulose/lignin content.
