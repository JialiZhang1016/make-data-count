ABSTRACT
Objective: to describe the chewing and swallowing pattern of obese individuals indica­
ted for bariatric surgery/gastroplasty before the procedure, using standardized clinical 
protocols. 
Methods: a cross-sectional descriptive case-control study that presents preliminary 
data for a larger investigation. Eight participants matched for age and sex were divided 
into two groups (four in the research group and four as controls) and submitted to 
clinical speech therapy assessment using the “Questionnaire on eating behavior and 
the anatomofunctional conditions of the stomatognathic system” from the Expanded 
Protocol of Orofacial Myofunctional Evaluation with Scores (OMES-E) and the maxi­
mum tongue pressure test. 
Results: when compared to controls, participants from the research group exhibited a 
predominantly unilateral chewing preference; reported that they just “swallowed food”; 
repeated swallowing of liquid and solid foods, with facial muscle tension; increased 
cheek volume and the presence of flaccidity; shorter meal and chewing times; increa­
sed tension of the lips, mentalis and facial muscles at rest and during swallowing; pre­
dominance of insufficient ability with associated movements and/or tremors during lip, 
tongue, jaw and cheek movements; and lack of knowledge regarding speech therapy. 
Conclusion: orofacial myofunctional dysfunctions were more frequent in patients from 
the research group when compared to controls. A need to increase the number of 
participants in this case series and conduct a post-surgery reassessment, in order to 
provide a longitudinal description of the chewing and swallowing pattern, was verified.

INTRODUCTION
Obesity is a chronic multifactorial disease with 
high prevalence levels that affects 23% of the adult 
population in Latin America and the Caribbean, that is, 
around 140 million people1.It is often accompanied by 
metabolic, vascular, respiratory, orthopedic, dermato­
logical and psychological comorbidities, which affect 
quality of life2.
Pharmacological measures, dietary reeducation and 
physical exercise have been adopted to tackle obesity, 
but in some cases may be insufficient to maintain 
or lose weight, exacerbating feelings of frustration 
and anxiety in these individuals. In these situations, 
surgical intervention to mechanically restrict eating is 
an alternative3.
As with all weight loss treatments, bariatric surgery 
and gastroplasty require monitoring by an inter- or 
multidisciplinary team, who provide the necessary 
support to change established habits and adjust to 
the new physical conditions, psychological impacts 
and adversities that emerge, in addition to favoring 
long-term results3.  
Postoperative negative effects such as choking, 
vomiting, 
gastroesophageal 
reflux, 
sensation 
of 
food sticking and swallowing and chewing-related 
complaints4 have prompted the inclusion of speech 
therapists in these teams3. Speech therapists monitor 
patients before and after surgery, providing guidance 
and assessment as well as preventive and rehabilitative 
measures relevant to their field, particularly in relation 
to chewing (mastication) and swallowing (deglutition), 
which are vital to the eating process3.
As such, the aim of this study is to describe preli­
minary results regarding the chewing and swallowing 
pattern of obese individuals indicated for bariatric 
surgery/gastroplasty, prior to the procedure, using 
standardized clinical protocols.
METHODS
The study was approved by the Research Ethics 
Committee of the Ceilândia Campus of the University 
of Brasília (UNB), Brazil, under report no. 2.665.236 
and CAAE protocol no. 82672118.1.0000.8093, and 
informed consent was given to conduct the study and 
use the resulting data.
A cross-sectional descriptive case-control design 
was used, presenting preliminary data from a larger 
investigation. This first stage contributed to assessing 
the proposed methodology and identifying any 
necessary adjustments. All participants were volun­
teers, divided into two groups – research and control. 
The research group (RG) consisted of obese individuals 
(class III) indicated for bariatric surgery and controls 
(CG) were healthy subjects with no speech-related 
complaints, matched for age and sex with the RG.
Inclusion criteria for the RG were individuals of both 
sexes, aged 18 years or older, clinically stable, who 
volunteered to take part after responding to an invitation 
on social media, indicated for bariatric surgery/gastro­
plasty and assessed, diagnosed and monitored by a 
medical team. Exclusion criteria (RG) were: 
a) neurological pathologies that prevent unders­
tanding the instructions and actions needed to perform 
the speech therapy intervention; b) previous head 
or neck pathologies or surgeries; c) those submitted 
to prior orofacial myofunctional speech therapy; d) 
contraindication for speech therapy; e) inability to orally 
ingest food; and f) history of head or neck tumors or 
trauma.
Inclusion criteria for the CG were healthy individuals 
with no complaints or abnormalities of stomatognathic 
structures and/or functions, confirmed by applying the 
OMES-E protocol5. As a cutoff point for inclusion in this 
group, participants had to score at least 210 points on 
the OMES-E instrument. The following exclusion criteria 
(CG) were adopted: lack of speech-related comorbi­
dities, cognitive or conscious impairments that prevent 
understanding the verbal information requested for the 
study assessment.
Participants underwent a battery of tests to 
characterize their chewing and swallowing pattern.
in a one-hour session, at an appropriately equipped 
location. Disposable gloves, wooden spatulas and a 
Glatzel mirror were also used to evaluate nasal airflow.
Due to the participants’ calorie restrictions, crackers 
(Club Social Original®) and water (200ml disposable 
cup) were used to assess chewing and swallowing of 
solids and liquids.
The 
following 
instruments 
were 
applied:1) 
Questionnaire on eating behavior and the anatomo­
functional conditions of the stomatognathic system6; 
2) Tongue pressure analysis using the Biofeedback 
Pró-Fono lip and tongue pressure system (PLL 
Pró-Fono); 3) OMES-E (Expanded protocol of orofacial 
myofunctional evaluation with scores)5.Below is a 
detailed description of the protocols.
The survey on eating behavior and the anatomo­
functional conditions of the stomatognathic system6 
contains questions developed by speech therapists

Chewing and swallowing in bariatric surgery/gastroplasty | 3/10
at the Ceará Obesity Center in Fortaleza, Ceará State, 
Brazil, aimed at identifying the eating behavior of obese 
individuals and anatomofunctional conditions of the 
stomatognathic system.
Maximum tongue pressure was analyzed using the 
Biofeedback Pró-Fono lip and tongue pressure system 
(PLL Pró-Fono), a portable device that measures the 
pressure exerted by the upper and lower lips on an 
air-filled bulb or by the dorsal surface or tip of the tongue 
against the bulb positioned on the palate.It consists of 
a pressure sensor connected to an electronic circuit 
board, housed in plastic casing. The pressure sensor 
is connected to the air-filled bulb via flexible plastic 
tubing. The device detects variations in air pressure and 
converts these signals into a kilopascal (kPa) versus 
time (s) graph. During the test, participants were seated 
on a comfortable chair with their feet flat on the floor 
and head parallel to the horizontal plane. They were 
given instructions on performing the test and the device 
was positioned in the oral cavity, in accordance with the 
cleaning and hygiene criteria stipulated by the team. 
Tongue pressure was evaluated in the following situa­
tions:Maximum lifting pressure of the tip of the tongue: 
participants raised the tip of the tongue and pressed it 
against the bulb, positioned in the retroincisal region; 
Maximum lifting pressure of the dorsal surface:par­
ticipants pressed the dorsal surface of the tongue 
against the bulb. Three consecutive measurements 
were performed for all of the tests, holding maximum 
pressure for 15 seconds with a 15-second rest between 
them,and considering the average of the three measu­
rements in each task.
The OMES-E protocol5 was compiled based on 
previous assessment models, with the inclusion of 
numerical scales that reflect the physical characte­
ristics and orofacial behavior of subjects. Thus, the 
components and functions of the stomatognathic 
system were analyzed in terms of their appearance/
posture, mobility and swallowing (liquid and solid), 
chewing and breathing functions.Participants were 
assessed in accordance with the protocol, by visual 
inspection during the session and subsequent analysis 
of the recorded images. A Canon Power Shot SX400IS 
camera was placed on a 1.20m high tripod about 
100cm from the subject, who remained seated in 
chair. The OMES-E was validated for young people 
and adults, showing 86% correlation with the reference 
protocol as well as sensitivity and specificity for the 
diagnosis of orofacial myofunctional disorders in the 
latter7. In this case series, maximum scores on OMES-E 
items were deemed as adequate appearance, posture/
position, mobility and functioning, where scores lower 
than those expected (mild, moderate or severe) were 
considered inadequate.
The results of the study are presented via simple 
descriptions, based on descriptive, absolute and 
relative values of the scores and answers obtained by 
each group of participants. 
RESULTS
All eight participants were volunteers, aged 28 to 45 
years (average age 35.12 years), matched for age and 
sex, with four in the RG and four controls (CG).

(n=3) to moderate (n=1) in the RG and mild (n=1) in 
the CG.
Altered tongue behavior in controls was caused by 
tongue thrust and positive overjet or negative overbite.
Other signs of swallowing dysfunction in the RG 
were tension in the facial muscles, andaltered posture 
during chewing.
Masticatorydysfunctions in the research group were 
caused by a lack of bite force.
The chewing pattern in the groups was charac­
terized as RG = mild (n=3) and chronic (n=1) unila­
teral preference; CG = bilateral and alternate (n=1), 
simultaneously bilateral (n=1), mild (n=1) and chronic 
preferred side (n=1).
In terms of swallowing efficiency, poor performance 
in both groups was related to repeated swallowing of 
the bolus.
Functional analysis of occlusion showed altera­
tions in interincisal distance below (n=2) and above 
expected values (n=1) in controls and higher than 
expected (n=1) in the RG; positive overjet in the 
CG and negative in the RG; lower-than-expected 
protrusion in both groups; positive (n=2) and negative 
(n=1) overbite in the RG, in addition to controls (2 
positive and 1 negative).
Figure 1 graphically illustrates maximum tongue 
pressure analysis and compares the values obtained 
by the two groups.
With respect to eating behavior, the RG showed 
worse performance in terms of the type of food eaten 
(more pasta and fewer vegetables), time spent on 
meals (shorter), sensitivity to flavor (low threshold), 
chewing performance (impaired) and hyperphagia (all 
RG subjects reported eating more when nervous or 
anxious).  
In regard to facial symmetry, the left side of the face 
was broader in three RG subjects andthree controls 
had a symmetrical appearance. The middle third of the 
face was larger in two RG participants and the lower 
third in another twoas well as one control.
With respect to the cheeks, the RG showed altered 
tension and configuration due to mild drooping (n=3), 
with three subjects exhibiting greater volume on both 
sides and a slightly larger right cheek in one control.
Abnormal tongue position was observed in the 
RG due to compression caused by dental occlusion, 
andin the CG as a result of tongue thrust associated 
with (negative) overbite and/or (positive) overjet. All 
those with tongue abnormalities(RG and CG) exhibited 
increased tongue volume.
In general, altered lip, tongue and jaw mobility in the 
RG was due to insufficient or nonexistent ability and/or 
tremors, andin the CG, insufficient ability with or without 
tremors.
Analysis of lip behavior during swallowing revealed 
increased contraction in both groups, which was mild

Chewing and swallowing in bariatric surgery/gastroplasty | 7/10
DISCUSSION
In general, the results corroborate those reported 
in the literature for the area8,9, that patients with class 
III obesity indicated for bariatric surgery tend to exhibit 
abnormalities in the structures and functioning of the 
stomatognathic system.
The literature4,8-10 indicates that bariatric surgery is 
more common among women,largely due to hormonal 
and esthetic issues and because they tend to be more 
careful about their health10.This was not the case in 
the present study, possibly because of the size of the 
sample.
The eating behavior observed in the RG was also in 
line with findings described in the literature.
Obese individuals typically favor a carbohydrate­
-based diet. When food is ingested, particularly that 
containing carbohydrates, the blood glucose level 
increases and the pancreas releases insulin to absorb 
and distribute glucose to the tissue in the form of energy, 
which also leads to a feeling of fullness (satiety).Food 
intake is regulated by the limbic system, located in the 
lateral (feeding center) andventromedial region (satiety 
center) of the hypothalamus. When adipocytes reach 
maximum fat storage, leptin is released and inhibits the 
feeding center, providing a feeling of satiety. Excessive 
carbohydrate consumption combined with genetic 
predisposition, low energy expenditure and eating 
energy-dense nutrient-poor foods increase BMI11.
A previous study found that overeating and 
incidents of hyperphagia may be positively related to 
the emotional state and BMI of individuals, with a more 
pronounced effect in women12.
Anxiety is a predictor of food intake, prompting the 
individual to eat in an attempt to regulate limbic system 
imbalance11-13.
The results obtained in orofacial myofunctional 
assessment to characterize chewing and swallowing 
patterns provided possible characterizations of the 
sample studied.Minor facial asymmetry was observed 
in the RG (n=4), with a correlation between the broader 
side of the face and preferred chewing side, corrobo­
rating data obtained in a previous study with obese 
children14.Both internal and external factors contribute 
to this characterization, including genetics, unilateral 
chewing pattern, malocclusion and temporomandibular 
joint (TMJ) dysfunction14.
All the RG subjects and two controls displayed 
preferred unilateral chewing, corroborating a previous 
study8 in which chewing and swallowing problems 
were more common in obese individuals.
Unilateral chewing tends to result in hypertrophy 
of the preferred side, particularly in the masseter, 
buccinator and temporal muscles. Predictors for this 
type of chewing pattern include occlusal abnorma­
lities (premature contact, occlusal interference, type 
of bite), missing teeth, parafunctional habits, and TMJ 
dysfunction15. Thus, bilateral chewing is considered 
ideal, with chewing cycles evenly distributed between 
both sides of the face5,7.
Decreased muscle tone and mobility in the speech 
organs directly affects chewing performance, bolus 
quality and swallowing. During swallowing, the RG

exhibited tension in the face muscles, with the tongue 
remaining in the oral cavity. Half the participants 
displayed repeated swallowing of the solid and liquid 
bolus. These data corroborate those obtained in a 
study with obese individuals16, except for lip tension 
during swallowing, which did not occur in this baseline 
study. Another investigation14 found that swallowing 
was less efficient in obese children than controls, which 
was not observed here.
When compared to the CG, patients indicated 
for bariatric surgery had shorter chewing times and 
reported they ‘just swallowed’ their food. Shorter 
chewing times are frequently reported in the literature 
among subjects with a high BMI9.  Research aimed 
at understanding the relationship between chewing 
time17, number of chews and satiety18 found that longer 
chewing times resulted in less food intake and hunger. 
The consistency of the food eaten is also important, 
with liquids providing less satiety than solids19. This is 
because of the shorter oral transit time (OTT) needed 
for liquids, meaning they have less time to activate the 
oropharyngeal sensory receptors and elicit the cephalic 
phase of digestion, which affects the inhibition of the 
feeding center and activation of the satiety center19.
Only the RG displayed an increased nasolabial 
sulcus for their age. The face is formed by soft (skin, 
adipose tissue, etc.) and hard tissue (bone and 
cartilage). Each compartment of subcutaneous fat 
tissue has distinct morphological characteristics20. Fat 
cells in the face tend to be more active than those in 
the abdomen. Adipocytes also vary according to BMI, 
sex (women tend to have larger fat cells than men), 
and their location in the face, whereby those in the 
nasolabial region are larger than fat cells in the deep 
medial cheek. According to the literature20, a high fat 
volume in these compartments inhibits synthesis in 
adjacent fibroblasts, altering the mechanical properties 
of the skin. High fat levels can also activate inflammatory 
factors that may contribute to this process. As such, the 
higher the degree of obesity, the greater the effects on 
skin aging, corroborating the data obtained here.
Our results demonstrated that tongue thrust 
occurred at rest and during swallowing in the CG, who 
were deemed to have a normal orofacial myofunc­
tional system, possibly due to the occlusal abnorma­
lities observed in these participants.In a study21 with 
100 participants, aimed at assessing occlusion in the 
Brazilian population, only 7% showed normal occlusion 
and 93% malocclusion. The authors concluded that 
although participants had good socioeconomic status, 
malocclusion did not affect their appearance and the 
need for orthodontic treatment went unnoticed until 
adulthood due to dentoskeletal and muscle compen­
sation, which concealed the problem.
Controls also exhibited altered tongue posture 
and mobility, the most common signs being greater 
tongue volume (n=2), poor mobility (n=4), and 
overbite (occlusion) (n=3). Researchers22 studying 
the oral motor system of 21 obese women found that 
72% exhibited altered tongue mobility and muscle 
tone, which was also very large and rested high in the 
mouth, limiting space inside the mouth, corroborating 
our findings in this case series. In another study8, the 
authors found statistical evidence of reduced tongue 
tonicity in obese patients, but no significant difference 
in mobility when compared to controls.
Two RG subjects had slightly narrow hard palates 
with mildly increased volume in relation to height. In 
these cases, the tongue was also compressed in the 
mouth, possibly due to the narrowness of the palate. 
The literature suggests that contributing factors to 
narrowing of the palate are insufficient force exerted by 
the tongue when incorrectlypositioned in the mouth, 
the use of bottles or pacifiers, thumb sucking, mouth 
breathing, and association with genetic syndromes23. 
The small number of participants precluded making 
inferences about the relation between obesity and 
altered palate formation; only the characteristics 
observed in the research group were described.
According to the literature, patient knowledge of 
speech therapy is an important factor in treatment 
adherence and perceiving any abnormalities, making it 
easier to develop suitable coherent approaches during 
intervention3. Five participants in the present study 
reported no knowledge of speech therapy and therefore 
had no related complaints, but their results confirmed 
the presence of some form of abnormality during 
assessment. This highlights the need to publicize this 
branch of science and its potential benefits.
We identified a need to increase the number of parti­
cipants in this case series and conduct a post-surgery 
reassessment in order to provide a longitudinal 
description of the chewing and swallowing pattern. The 
benefit of interventions targeting the orofacial myofunc­
tional system of patients indicated for bariatric surgery/
gastroplasty can also be confirmed.A limitation of this 
study and proposed improvement for future research is 
the need to use more than one inclusion criterion for

score of 120 points on the OMES-E and the presence 
of Angle class I malocclusion be considered in order to 
reduce possible biases.
Given the abnormalities observed in the research 
group, the inclusion of speech therapists in multidisci­
plinary teams (doctors, psychologists, nutritionists etc.) 
is highly recommended, since they are trained to treat 
the structures and functioning of the orofacial myofunc­
tional system.
CONCLUSION
This study described the characteristics observed 
in four individuals presented with class III obesity 
indicated for bariatric surgery, and the respective 
control cases used for comparison purposes. Orofacial 
myofunctional dysfunctions were more frequent in 
patients from the RG when compared to controls. The 
data provided by this study might contribute to future 
research in the area.
