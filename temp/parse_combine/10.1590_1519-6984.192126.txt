Abstract
The main objective of the present study was to promote some adaptations to the standard methodology used in the 
analysis of Cladocera subfossils. The samples used in this study were collected at Lagoa dos Coutos, a temporary 
lake located on an outcrop with iron-rich duricrust in the Serra do Gandarela (Minas Gerais, Brazil). The sediment 
from this pond, typical of temporary ecosystems in the region, is characterized by rigid concretions that are difficult to 
dissolve in aqueous media, making it difficult to visualize and analyze subfossils taxa. Sediment samples were prepared 
according to the standard methodology used in paleolimological studies and the methodological adaptations proposed 
in the present study, which included the addition of 1 mg of Kochia scoparia, a palynological marker used to estimate 
subfossil density, as well as the addition of hydrofluoric acid (HF) to oxidize silicate materials. The samples prepared 
according to the new methodological procedure improved Cladocera subfossil visualization, facilitating the taxonomic 
analysis of the species. The samples submitted to the standard methodological procedure had a significantly higher 
mean of sediment particles (mean of 84.2 sediment particles) and 70% more residues compared to the samples prepared 
with the newly proposed methodology (mean of 22.1 sediment particles). Absolute data on the temporal variation of 
the density of Cladocera subfossils was obtained by using the palinological marker K. scoparia, which showed higher 
densities of subfossils in more recent, humid periods (112,000 subfossils/cm3 at 5 cm, equivalent to 3,500 years BP). 
The results indicate that the new methodology can contribute to advances in paleolimnological studies of temporary 
aquatic ecosystems, whose lake histories are rarely investigated, despite their ecological relevance as ecosystems that 
indicate environmental and climatic changes.

Resumo
O principal objetivo do presente estudo foi promover algumas adaptações na metodologia padrão utilizadas para 
a análise de subfósseis de Cladocera. As amostras utilizadas nessa pesquisa foram coletadas na Lagoa dos Coutos, 
uma lagoa temporária encontrada em solo de afloramento ferruginoso na Serra do Gandarela (Minas Gerais, Brasil). 
O  sedimento desta lagoa, típico de ecossistemas temporários da região, caracteriza-se por apresentar concreções rígidas 
de difícil dissolução em meio aquoso, que dificultam a visualização e análise taxonômica dos subfósseis. Amostras 
de sedimento foram preparadas de acordo com a metodologia padrão utilizada em estudos paleolimnológicos e as 
adaptações metodológicas propostas no presente estudo, que incluíram a adição de 1 mg de Kochia scoparia, um marcador 
palinológico utilizado para estimar a densidade de subfósseis, além da adição de ácido fluorídrico (HF) para oxidação de 
materiais silicáticos. As amostras preparadas de acordo com o novo procedimento metodológico apresentaram melhor 
visualização dos subfósseis de Cladocera, facilitando a análise taxonômica das espécies. As amostras submetidas ao 
procedimento metodológico padrão apresentaram uma média significativamente maior de partículas de sedimentos 
(média de 84,2 partículas de sedimento) e 70% mais resíduos em comparação com as amostras preparadas com a nova 
metodologia proposta (média de 22,1 partículas de sedimento). Dados absolutos sobre a variação temporal da densidade 
dos subfósseis de Cladocera foram obtidos a partir do uso do marcador palinológico K. scoparia, revelando densidades

1. Introduction
Paleolimnological studies are essential to analyze 
temporal evolution of aquatic ecosystems, changes in 
biodiversity and the influence global events have on 
aquatic ecosystem processes. In general, lake sediments 
are excellent integrators of the aquatic communities’ 
dynamics, and therefore regarded as refined testimonies of 
whole-lake changes (Gregory‐Eaves and Beisner, 2011). 
The paleolimnological approach has recently become an 
important aid for aquatic ecosystem conservation decision 
making, utilizing past and present conditions to support new 
guidelines in terms of habitat quality and predisturbance 
conditions (Battarbee and Bennion, 2011).
The effectiveness of cladoceran subfossils as 
paleolimnological indicators is established in many studies. 
They have been used to elucidate species complexity, 
global climate changes as well as processes related to 
temporal dynamics of lakes such as predation effects, 
cultural eutrophication and acidification, among others 
(Amsinck et al., 2007; Jeppesen et al., 2001; Kamenik et al., 
2007; Nevalainen et al., 2012; Rautio et al., 2000).
In the ferruginous geosystems of Quadrilátero Ferrífero 
of Minas Gerais (Southeastern Brazil), the presence of 
temporary ponds and the formation of ephemeral shallow 
lakes are frequents. In this region, the lake substrate 
consists of banded iron formations, mainly originated in 
the Eon Archean (4.6 – 2.5 Ga) and in the Eon Proterozoico 
(2.5 Ga to 1.6 Ma). These ferruginous concretions, which 
contain at least 15% of iron, are highly resistant to weathering, 
becoming an impermeable shell upon desiccation (Carmo 
and Kamino, 2015). These sedimentological traits make 
the extraction and analysis of zooplanktonic subfossils 
difficult, and this is why we propose a methodological 
adaptation to improve analysis and visualization of the 
cladoceran subfossils. We believe that the improvements 
obtained after the adaptations may be useful in future 
paleolimnological studies, especially those performed in 
temporary aquatic ecosystem sediments subjected to long 
desiccation periods.
2. Methods
Coutos Lake (19°59’6.54” S; 43°33’4.75” W) is an 
intermittent shallow temporary lake located in an ironstone 
outcrop area of Serra do Gandarela Mountains (Minas Gerais 
State, Brazil, at 1072 m.a.s.l.). The lake has an average 
depth of 0.65 cm, reaching 1.5 m during the rainy season. 
During the dry period the lake may stay up to 7  months 
without any water. Coutos Lake is representative of the 
harshest conditions of dryness. This shallow lake is located 
on an outcrop with iron-ruch duricrust, under severe 
edapho-climatic conditions, including high ultraviolet (UV) 
intensities and daily temperature variations of the substrate 
that can easily exceed 50 °C (Jacobi and Carmo, 2008).
A sediment core was collected with a 15 cm diameter, 
25 cm long PVC pipe, in the center of the lake (called P1). 
This core was then retrieved, sealed with Parafilm and 
plastic wrap, kept in a cooler at 8 °C and brought back to the 
Laboratory of Aquatic Ecology at the Federal University of 
Ouro Preto and kept in the freezer at -4 °C until processing. 
After thawing, the core was opened on opposing sides 
using a Dremel 3000 rotary saw. Thereafter, the cores 
were separated into two halves and superficially scraped 
with a plastic knife to prevent cross layer contamination 
(Leibowitz, 2016). The core was then cut in 1-cm sections 
for the first 10 cm (P1C4-1 through P1C4-10). Each 1-cm 
sample was then placed in a petri dish and weighed on 
a Shimadzu AY220 analytical scale. Subsequently each 
sub-sample was put in an oven <40 °C until a constant 
weight was achieved (~48 hours). The sub-samples were 
then homogenized and quartered. Samples at 5 and 10-cm 
of each core, were sent to Beta Analytic (Florida, USA) 
for carbon dating. CALIB (Stuiver and Reimer 1993) was 
used along with the most recent southern hemispheric 
calibration set to calibrate and interpolate 14C dates, which 
revealed a time resolution of approximately 320 years in 
the superficial centimeter and 5450 years in 10 cm.
Sediment subsamples were analyzed according 
to two tested methodologies: the Korhola and Rautio 
(2001), Szeroczyska and Sarmaja-Korjonen (2007) usual 
methodologies and the adapted method in this study. In the 
standard methodology, 1cm3 sedimentary portions were 
submerged in a 10% potassium hydroxide solution (KOH), 
heated to 80ºC in a water bath and manually homogenized 
manually for 30 minutes. After this stage, the material was 
rinsed with distilled water and filtered in 50 μm opening 
mesh. The remaining sediment was centrifuged (3000 rpm 
for10 min) and used in the preparation of permanent slides 
with glycerin gelatin and analyzed via optical microscopy.
In the proposed methodology 1 cm3 portions of the 
sediment were used, spiked with 1 mg of the palynological 
marker Kochia scoparia. The addition of this marker allows 
us to determine more clearly the subfossils concentration 
in the sediment (number of subfossils/cm3), because 1 mg 
of the palynological marker contains about 60,500 grains 
(Salgado-Labouriau and Rull, 1986). The subsamples were 
then submerged in a 10% potassium hydroxide solution 
for 1 hour, heated to 80ºC in water bath and manually 
homogenized for 60 minutes. Next, the material was rinsed 
with distilled water and filtered in a 30μm opening mesh 
and placed in hydrofluoric acid solution (HF) for 24 hours 
for oxidation of silicate materials that make it difficult to 
mais elevadas de subfósseis nos períodos recentes (112.000 subfósseis/cm3 nos 5 cm iniciais, equivalentes a 3.500 anos 
BP). Os resultados obtidos indicam que a nova metodologia pode contribuir para avanços em estudos paleolimnológicos 
de ecossistemas aquáticos temporários, raramente contemplados na reconstrução da história de lagos, apesar de sua 
relevância ecológica como ecossistemas sinalizadores de mudanças ambientais e climáticas.

visualize the subfossils. After this step, the sediment was 
filtered in a 30μm opening mesh size to reduce the loss 
of subfossil structures. Subsequently they were mounted 
on permanent slides for optical microscopy (Figure 1).
Three permanent slides were analyzed for the subfossils 
counting, which were prepared according to the two 
tested methodologies. At least 10 optical fields were 
used for each slide and a minimum of 100 subfossil parts 
of Cladocera exoskeleton (carapaces, head shields, post 
abdomen, in addition to ephippials) were counted under an 
optical microscope. The taxonomical identification of the 
subfossils followed Elmoor-Loureiro (1997) identification 
description key. The counting of the material in the slides 
took into consideration, besides the Cladocera subfossils, 
the sediment residues in the sample.
The determination of the number of zooplanktonic 
subfossils in the sample (number of subfossils/cm3) was 
performed using the following formula:

3. Results and Discussion
Analyzing the two methodological preparations related 
to the presence of sediment fragments in the final samples, 
a statistically significant difference was obtained between 
the two sets of samples (usual and adapted methodology). 
In the usual method the sediment particle average in 
the final sub-samples was significantly higher (ca. 70% 
more particles and median of 84.2 of sediment particles) 
than the average found in the sub-samples submitted 
to the new methodological procedure (less than 40%, 
averaging 22.1 sediment particles) (Test-t, p < 0.0001; 
gl 12.63) (Figure 2). From the qualitative point of view, 
the difference between the sub-samples prepared with 
distinctive methodologies is clearly visible by observing 
Figure 3. The sub-samples submitted to the proposed 
procedure showed lower presence of sediment residues, 
facilitating the location, identification and morphometric 
measure taking of the subfossils.

The determination of the zooplanktonic subfossil 
density in the sediment (number of subfossils/cm3) is not a 
traditional approach in paleolimnology, however it enables 
the researcher to produce absolute data as opposed to merely 
relative data. The obtained results in the present study suggest 
that the use of the K. scoparia palynological marker may 
constitute a satisfactory approach to the determination of 
zooplanktonic subfossil density, because the development 
of a specific marker for studies with cladoceran subfossils 
has not been elaborated. The results indicate a prominent 
temporal variation of the zooplanktonic subfossils in 
Lake Coutos, with generally higher densities (maximum 
of 112.000 subfossils/cm3) in more recent period (5 cm, 
equivalent to 3,500 BP) (Figure 4).
Paleolimnological reconstructions of lakes are an 
essential tool for lake ecology, management and conservation 
(Brugam and Speziale, 1983). Considering the extreme 
shortage of paleolimnological studies in Latin America 
and the great diversity of temporary aquatic ecosystems 
(rivers, lakes, lagoons and reservoirs) that represent 
important environmental sites for the understanding of 
aquatic ecosystems temporal evolution, we believe that 
the proposed methodology may make it easier for the 
development of new studies and techniques that provide 
advances in the paleolimnological approaches of temporary 
aquatic ecosystems in Brazil.
