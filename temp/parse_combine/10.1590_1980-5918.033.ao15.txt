Abstract
Introduction: The lumbar pain is the main musculoskeletal complaint reported by the active population, and it 
prevents daily activities such as walking. Objective: To assess muscle recruitment and the co-contraction of the 
trunk muscles during different walking speed in individuals with and without chronic lumbar pain. Method: 
Thirty-four sedentary young women attended the study, in which 18 belonged to the lumbar pain team (LPT) and 
16 to the team without lumbar pain (WLP). We assessed the electromyography activity of the internal oblique 
(IO) local muscle and lumbar multifidus (MUL), and global external oblique (EO), abdominal rectus (AR) and 
lumbar iliocostalis (LIC), during walking. The electromyography analysis was performed from the average of the

linear envelope value, normalized by the peak of muscle activation. The muscle co-contraction (IO/MUL, EO/LIC, 
AR/LIC, IO/EO, and the abdominal/paravertebral muscle groups) was calculated with the Falconer and Winter 
formula. The Shapiro-Wilk test, Multivariate Analysis, mixed Variance Analyses with Bonferroni post-hoc, and 
Pearson (p < 0.05) correlation coefficient were made by the statistical analysis. Results: In the WLP we could 
notice that the higher the speed, the higher the MUL activation. The co-contraction data demonstrated that IO/
MUL muscles activate 20% more in the LPT, during the preferred speed; however, in the WLP, the results showed 
that the higher the walking speed, the higher the EO/LIC (21.8%) and IO/MUL (17.8%) muscles activation. 
Conclusion: The recruitment of local muscles doesn’t differ among the evaluated groups and conditions; 
however, in WLP, the higher the MUL muscle action, the higher the walking speed.

Muscle recruitment and co-contraction when walking in young women with chronic lumbar pain

Introduction
The lumbar pain [LP] is the main physical 
complaint reported by the active population [1] 
and mainly in voluntary activities, in which 80% of 
them evolve with symptom remission, while 20% 
become chronic [2]. The high incidence of LP in the 
population results in an increase in health expenses 
and longer work leave time [3]. To perform several 
different daily activities (DA), we need some systems 
that maintain spine stability and consequently keep 
it healthy [4].
The spine stabilization is performed through 
the active, passive, and neural systems that 
simultaneously act and control movements [4]. The 
muscles belong to the active system and stabilize the 
vertebral segments [5]. They can be split into local 
and global stabilizers, according to their functions 
[4, 5]. The local stabilizer muscles are unisegmental 
and promote intervertebral control; the internal 
oblique (IO) and the lumbar multifidus (MUL) 
muscles belong to this system [5, 6]. The global 
stabilizer muscles present moving characteristics, 
with torque production and are compound by 
external oblique (EO), abdominal rectus (AR), and 
lumbar iliocostal (LIC) muscles [4-6].
During dynamic movements, stability is 
challenged all the time, and the muscle co-
contraction is one of the mechanisms that the central 
nervous system (CNS) has to stabilize a certain 
segment [6-9]. Walking is a dynamic task with high 
frequency during the day, and as far as it is known, 
in the presence of chronic lumbar pain (CLP) the 
individuals present lower amplitude of the articular 
movement, rigidity, shorter step length, higher step 
width [10, 11] and shorter walking speed. These are 
predictors of the individual physical conditions, once 
the preferred speed refers to the characteristics of 
the daily life rhythm, while the fast walking refers 
to the adaptation capacity to the efforts [11], thus 
culminating in functional limitation, inability, and 
pain [12].
Therefore, this work’s objective was to assess 
the recruitment and co-contraction of the trunk 
muscles during different walking speeds, in 
individuals with and without CLP. We hypothesize 
that the participants with CLP will have lower 
walking speed, higher muscle recruitment, and 
higher trunk muscle co-contraction when compared 
to the control team.

The criteria for LPT eligibility were to be female, 
sedentary for at least six months, with at least two 
idiopathic episodes of lumbar region pain in the last 
three months [13]. The inclusion criteria were the 
same for WLP; however, the participants should 
not have presented episodes of lumbar pain in the 
last three months. The non-eligibility criteria were 
treatment with anti-inflammatory or analgesic in the 
last 72 hours; with nervous compression signal [12], 
ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, tumor 
presence in the spine, vertebral fracture, equine tail 
syndrome [14], BMI higher than 29.99 kg/m²[15] 
and not to be able to perform 120o of trunk flexion.
A pilot study with four volunteers in each team 
performed the sample calculation. The used variable 
was of co-contraction of IO/MUL muscles for the 
condition 1 of walking, with the power of 0.80, error 
probability α of 0.05, effect size of 0.875, estimating 
the need of thirty-four volunteers as a whole.

Procedures
Data collection consisted of the evaluation of 
the pain intensity at the lumbar region, and the 
electromyography during walking. The Visual 
Analogue Scale (VAS) measured the pain intensity; 
it was verified with a ruler from “without pain/
discomfort” until “worse pain/discomfort” [16]. 
We requested the participants to mark the pain 
intensity felt at the collection moment and the daily 
pain intensity to quantify the value obtained in the 
test [16]. The walking was evaluated during the 
ten first cycles in two conditions. The tests were 
randomly performed to avoid the execution order 
interfered with the results [7], break of two minutes 
between the conditions and familiarization with the 
preferred speed for five minutes [7]. We guided 
the volunteers not to use the support base of the 
treadmill handles and to remain barefoot during 
the collection [15].
To determine the preferred speed used at the 
treadmill, a speed evaluation on the floor was 
initially used , where the participants walked on a 
20-meter track, and the time used to walk the central 
10 meters was measured, deducing the initial and 
final 5 meters [7]. The test was performed three 
times, and the average value was defined as the 
floor walking preferred speed [7]. It was used 50% 
of the preferred speed on the floor to start the test 
on the treadmill; this speed was gradually increased 
until the participant refers that it was “faster than 
usual” [17]. After reaching this mark, the speed was 
gradually decreased until the participants referred 
that it was “slower than the usual one” [17]. The test 
was performed three times and used the average of 6 
values to determine the preferred speed on treadmill 
[14, 17]. The second condition evaluated was during 
the maximum speed on the treadmill. To determine 
this value, we guided the volunteers to walk at the 
fastest speed possible without running [18].
Electromyography
We collected the electromyographic data during 
the walking on an INBRAMED® ergometric treadmill. 
Data about the dominance of lower members were 
collected to define the side the electrodes should be 
positioned for the electromyographic evaluation. The 
dominance was evaluated by tests of going up and 
down a step, kicking a ball at the target, and by the 
former displacement test [19]. We used an acquisition 
module of biological signals Model MyosystemBr1_
P84 (Data Hominis®) of 8 channels, software 
MyosistemBr1® to capture the electromyographic 
signals. This module was used for the collection, 
real-time visualization, data storing and processing, 
calibrated with sample frequency of 2000 Hz, total 
gain of 2000 times (20 times in the sensor and 100 
times on the equipment), and rejection index of 
common way of 92 dB to 60 Hz.
The skin was previously prepared by performing 
a trichotomy with a razor blade on the region where 
the electrodes were placed; the cleanliness of the 
area was made with alcohol and the abrasion with 
gauze to decrease the impedance on the region [20]. 
We used electrodes of the active surface of Ag/AgCl 
(Data Hominis®) formed by two rectangular bars 
(10 × 1 mm) and distant 10 mm from each other, fixed 
with adhesive tape on the skin. A reference electrode 
was positioned over the ulnar styloid process [4], 
and the surface electrodes were positioned on the 
dominant side [19].
The participants were in dorsal decubitus for the 
location and positioning of the electrodes:
-- IO: 2  cm medial and inferior to the 
anteroposterior iliac spine (EIAS) [21].
-- AR: ½ the distance between the xiphoid 
process and the umbilical scar, 3 cm lateral 
[22].
-- EO: ½ the distance between the EIAS and the 
inferior region of the rib cage [23].
The participants were in ventral decubitus for the 
location and positioning of the electrodes:
-- MUL: Positioned on the line that links the 
posterior superior iliac spine and the space 
between L1 and L2 at the level of L5 [20].
-- LIC: 6 cm laterally to the space between the 
spiny processes of L2-L3 [24].
Electromyographic analysis
The electromyographic analysis occurred during 
the walking, along with the ten consecutive stepping 
cycles, determined from the visual assessment made 
by the same assessor, of 10 calcaneus touches of 
the lower limb on the ergometric treadmill. From 
specific routines on the software Matlab®, the

electromyographic signal was filtered through 
the 4th order high-pass filter Butterworth with cut 
frequency of 20 Hz and a 4th order low-pass filter 
Butterworth with cut frequency of 500 Hz. Afterward, 
the signal was rectified by full-wave and softened 
with a 4th order low-pass filter Butterworth with a 
cut frequency of 6 Hz to form the linear envelope. 
The electromyographic data of the muscular 
recruitment are in activation average of the linear 
envelope of 10 stepping cycles and normalized by 
the activation peak during the walking on treadmill 
with maximum speed to determine the muscular co-
contraction from the percentage calculation of the 
co-contraction according to the formula of Falconer 
and Winter [25]: 
%con - con = 2x

M agon and M antag represent the moments of the 
strength of the agonists and antagonists respectively. 
The co-contraction was performed for the muscles IO/
MUL, EO/LIC, AR/LIC, IO/EO and for the abdominal/
paravertebral muscle groups (ABD/PARA). To 
determine the ABD/PARA co-contraction, from the IO, 
EO, and AR linear envelope, we created a new linear 
envelope that represents the activation average of the 
linear envelope referring to the abdominal muscles. 
For the paravertebral muscles, we performed the 
same procedure, creating a new linear envelope 
that represented the activation average of the linear 
envelope of the MUL and LIC muscles.
Statistical analysis
The software SPSS® analyzed the obtained data. 
Shapiro-Wilk test verified the normality of the data and 
we adopted the multivariate analysis, mixed analysis 
of variance considering the factors team and condition 
with post-hoc Bonferroni and Person correlation 
coefficient, considering significant when p < 0.05.
Results
Table 2 shows the walking speed values of both 
teams. With the main effect for speed p < 0.001 and 
F = 175.092, for the team p = 0.270 and F = 1.258, 
and for interaction Team X Condition p = 0.237 and 
F = 1.509, i.e., there is no significant difference at the 
walking speed between individuals with or without 
lumbar pain.

demonstrated that by increasing the treadmill speed 
there was an increase in all the muscle recruitment 
when compared to condition 1 and condition 2 in 
each team; however, there was no difference between 
LPT and CT (WLP).

The recruitment results were correlated with the 
pain level obtained by EVA on the test day and daily on 
LPT and we observed moderate negative correlation 
among condition 2, maximum walking speed, EO 
muscle, and daily pain, which indicates that the higher 
the EO muscle activation during maximum walking 
speed, the lower the pain level (r = ₋0.570, p = 0.014). On 
performing the correlation between the walking speed 
and the muscular recruitment, there was a significant 
difference between maximum walking speed and the 
MUL muscle recruitment at condition 2 for CT, which 
suggests that the higher the maximum speed, the higher 
the MUL muscle activation (r = 0.540, p = 0.031).

contraction of the local and global muscles with

Condition, the LPT at condition 1 presented co-
contraction of IO/MUL 20% higher (p = 0.028). 
Also, CT presented an increase of 21.8% at the 
contraction of the muscles EO/LIC (p < 0.001) 
on comparing conditions 1 and 2. The same also 
occurs for the muscles IO/MUL (p < 0.001), with 
an increase of 17.8%.

Discussion
Individuals with lumbar pain present stability 
loss, decreasing in their spine functionality [26]. The 
active trunk stability is guaranteed by the integration 
of three factors: load-bearing, mobility permission 
and lesions, and pain prevention [27], which are 
undermined in individuals with lumbar pain. The 
results showed that the preferred walking speed 
did not present significant differences between the 
teams, but this was not seen at the literature review 
that reports lower preferred speed and maximum 
walking in the elderly population [10]. This can 
occur due to the functional adaptation [11] that has 
as characteristic, for example, shorter step length and 
higher step width [1]. The findings corroborate the 
literature because the participants of this study are 
young; with this, the pain may not have interfered 
with the walking speed.
In this study we observed that for the two walking 
conditions, there are different activation standards, 
and with the speed increase, the activation increase 
of all the muscles of the evaluated trunk (IO, MUL, LIC, 
EO, and AR). We believed that on performing walks 
at low speed, there is higher temporal variability in 
exchange of higher dynamic stability [13]. This way, on 
increasing the speed and instability, the muscles EO, 
IO, and AR increase the activation producing higher 
muscular strength and consequently increasing 
the rigidity of the trunk muscles and, therefore, 
increasing the stability [27].
MUL muscle showed higher activation with 
the increase of walking speed and higher co-
contraction of the muscles IO/MUL in women 
with CLP at condition 1 (preferred speed). These 
data showed that individuals with CLP present

segmental instability, which results in higher 
antagonist co-activation, improving the motor 
control and the trunk stability [28]; however, 
this strategy results in excessive trunk hardening 
[29]. These results corroborate the correlation 
data, which demonstrated that the higher the pain 
level, the lower the activation of the EO muscle 
in walking with maximum speed. Thus, the trunk 
instability increases the pain levels, revealing the 
LPT susceptibility and its dependence on the global 
muscles to keep stable [30]. These answers can be 
caused in individuals with CLP for maintaining the 
adaptation of the CNS to protect the structures of 
the spine [30]; however, in the long term, these 
adaptations overload the spine and cause pain [31].
Regarding the CT, the results showed higher co-
contraction for IO/MUL and EO/LIC only at overload 
moments (condition 2). These are proportional to 
the increase of co-contraction, demonstrated in the 
study of Granata and Marras [8], i.e., with the increase 
of the physical effort, there is also an increase in the 
co-contraction. These data can be confirmed by the 
correlation results between the recruitment of the 
MUL muscle at condition two and the amount of 
maximum walking speed that demonstrated that the 
MUL muscle increases its contraction, the higher the 
physical effort. Even at a situation of higher physical 
requirement, the CNS is reorganized so that the local 
muscles increase their activation, maintaining the 
stability, but even though, remaining with values 
inferior to the ones reached by LPT [8, 30]. A previous 
study analyzed the antagonist activation and co-
contraction of the stabilizer muscles after the 
isometric activation of the IO muscles. I individuals 
without CLP presented better control of the trunk 
muscles over individuals with LP [17], corroborating 
our results.
Conclusion
The recruitment of the stabilizer muscles does 
not differ between the teams at different walking 
speeds; however, there was higher activation of the 
muscle MUL at CT at condition 2. Regarding the co-
contraction, the muscles IO/MUL showed that LPT 
needed higher activation during condition 1, while 
CT increased the activation of the same muscles only 
at condition 2, as well as increased the recruitment 
of the muscles EO/LIC.
