The crystal structure of a 5-¯uorouracil±thymine [5-¯uoro-
pyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione±5-methylpyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-
dione, C4H3FN2O2C5H6N2O2] solid solution has been deter-
mined. Both of the crystallographically independent sites can
accommodate either 5-¯uorouracil or thymine molecules,

[C5ÿxH6±3xFxN2O2-
C5ÿyH6ÿ3xFyN2O2, with x = 0.52 and y = 0.7 for determination
(I), x = 0.55 and y = 0.69 for (II), and x = 0.67 and y = 0.76 for
(III)]. The 5-¯uorouracil±thymine ratio in the crystal structure
is in¯uenced by the 5-¯uorouracil±thymine ratio in the
crystallization solution, though it does not exactly mirror it.
The crystal structure comprises interpenetrating hydrogen-
bonded nets, containing four independent hydrogen bonds.
Comment
F atoms and methyl groups have been identi®ed as being
capable of replacing one another in a molecule to produce
isomorphic crystal structures because of their similar size,
shape and van der Waals interactions (Kuhnert-Brandstatter,
1982). Attempts were made to exploit this interchangeability
as part of an ongoing study into the crystalline solid state of
5-¯uorouracil (Hulme et al., 2005; Hamad et al., 2006), with the
aim of growing 5-¯uorouracil crystals isostructural with
thymine (Portalone et al., 1999) or thymine crystals isostruc-
tural with 5-¯uorouracil form 1 (Fallon, 1973). Instead of
producing such isostructural cocrystals, an entirely new
structure was discovered, grown from solution in 2,2,2-
tri¯uoroethanol, containing 5-¯uorouracil and thymine in a
solid solution.
A cocrystal can be de®ned as a crystal structure containing
two (or more) molecular species on separate crystallographic
sites with a ®xed stoichiometric ratio in the crystal structure, in
contrast with a solid solution, which exhibits `a homogeneous
crystalline phase in which some of the constituent molecules
are substituted by foreign molecules that possess suf®cient
similarity that the lattice dimensions are changed only slightly'
(Datta & Grant, 2004). In the structure reported here, both of
the crystallographically independent sites (Fig. 1) can be
occupied by either 5-¯uorouracil or thymine molecules, giving
non-integer occupancies for both molecules at each site and
leading to the description of this structure as a solid solution
rather than a cocrystal.
The structure adopts the monoclinic space group C2/c. The
crystal structure, denoted (I), of a crystal grown from a 1:1
solution of 5-¯uorouracil and thymine, with the structure
determined at 150 K, is reported; two further structure
determinations are reported to exemplify the features of this

system. (II) denotes the crystal structure determination of a
crystal grown from a 1:1 solution at 298 K and (III) denotes
the crystal structure determination of a crystal grown from a
2:1 solution of 5-¯uorouracil and thymine at 150 K. Structure
(I) will be used exclusively for the purposes of the discussion
of the crystal structure, with the other two determinations
used to highlight features of the solid solution structure.
The only difference between 5-¯uorouracil and thymine is
the substituent bonded to the 5-position in the molecular
structure, and hence the only sign of the occupational disorder
is the F:Me ratio at the 9- and 19-positions in the crystal
structure. Both (I) and (II) were grown from 1:1 5-¯uorouracil/
thymine crystallization solutions and have similar F:Me ratios
at the 9- and 19-postions [for (I), 0.52 (1):0.48 (1) for the
9-position and 0.70 (1):0.30 (1) for the 19-position; for (II),
0.55 (1):0.45 (1) for the 9-position and 0.69 (2):0.31 (2) for the
19-position]. This result indicates that the 5-¯uorouracil/
thymine ratio in the crystals is not simply a statistical distri-
bution throughout the crystal but depends on the ratio in the
crystallization solution. This fact is exempli®ed by the distinct
preference for incorporating F at the 19-position, even though
the original crystallization solution contained a 1:1 ratio.
Structure (III) was grown from a 2:1 solution and has a higher
proportion of F at both positions [0.66 (1):0.34 (1) for the
9-position and 0.76 (1):0.24 (1) for the 19-position]. It can be
concluded that altering the 5-¯uorouracil/thymine ratio in the
crystallization solution will alter the ratio at each of the
crystallographically independent sites. Re®nements of (I) as
either fully 5-¯uorouracil or fully thymine did not prove
satisfactory, yielding unacceptable displacement parameters at
the 9- and 19-positions, and higher than expected R factors,
thus con®rming the disordered model.
Structure (II), measured at room temperature, shows
thermal expansion in the a axis of approximately 0.5 AÊ (2.6%)
compared with structure (I), determined at 150 K. No signif-
icant change is evident in either of the other cell axes or the 
angle. The unit cell was determined at 298 K for the crystal
used for (III) at 150 K, and a similar expansion in the a axis
was observed [a = 19.704 (11) AÊ at 298 K and a = 19.235 (3) AÊ
at 150 K].
It should be noted that crystals with this structure could not
be grown from solutions with 5-¯uorouracil/thymine ratios of
3:1 or 1:2, and attempts to grow pure 5-¯uorouracil crystals
with this structure from seeded solutions also failed. This
implies that the two compounds have a limited solubility range
in this solid solution.
The crystal structure contains four independent NÐH  O
hydrogen bonds, and all hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors
are used (Table 1±3). Two R2
2(8) hydrogen-bonded dimers are
present (Bernstein et al., 1995), with one dimer composed of
two N3ÐH3  O8(ÿx + 1, ÿy + 2, ÿz + 1) hydrogen bonds
and the other dimer composed of two N13ÐH13  O18(ÿx + 3
2,
ÿy + 1
2, ÿz + 2) hydrogen bonds. Along with the dimers, two
single D1
1(2) hydrogen bonds participate in the overall
hydrogen-bond network (Fig. 2), viz. N1ÐH1  O17(ÿx + 3
2,
y ÿ 1
2, ÿz + 3
2) and N11ÐH11  O7.
The hydrogen bonds build a two-dimensional net, with the
constituent rings of the net made up of 14 molecules in an
approximately rectangular conformation. Of the 14 molecules,
12 are involved in six dimers joined by R2
2(8) hydrogen-
bonded rings, and these dimers are connected together by
single hydrogen bonds. The two remaining molecules are at
diagonally opposite corners of the rectangle; along with the
two single hydrogen bonds that incorporate each of these
molecules into the ring, each participates in a dimer with the
second molecule part of the adjacent ring. These interactions
hence produce the two-dimensional net motif (Fig. 3).
Two subsets of nets are observed; within each subset, the
planes of the nets are parallel to one another, but each of the
subsets is parallel to different Miller planes, viz. [511] and
[511]. The two subsets interpenetrate to give the overall three-
dimensional hydrogen-bonded motif (Fig. 4), with hydrogen
bonding at the points of interpenetration of the nets via single
hydrogen bonds only.

Experimental
The crystals used for determinations (I) and (II) were produced from
a saturated solution of 5-¯uorouracil and thymine (1:1 molar ratio) in
2,2,2-tri¯uoroethanol by solvent evaporation. The crystal used for
structure determination (III) was produced from a saturated solution
of 5-¯uorouracil and thymine (2:1 molar ratio) in 2,2,2-tri¯uoro-
ethanol by solvent evaporation.

than the methyl H atoms were located in a difference map and were
re®ned isotropically. In determinations (I) and (II), methyl H atoms
were modelled as idealized disordered methyl groups over two sites
offset by 60. For determination (III), the C19 methyl group was
modelled as an idealized disordered methyl group, and for the C9
methyl group the H atoms were located from a difference map and
re®ned using a rigid rotor model. For structure determination (I), the
re®ned CÐH bond lengths are 0.948 (18) and 0.968 (17) AÊ , with all
methyl CÐH bond lengths ®xed at 0.98 AÊ ; the range of NÐH bond
