ABSTRACT
Background: The IAEA recommends a quality assurance program in radiotherapy to ensure safe and
effective treatments. In this study, radiotherapy departments were surveyed on their current practice
including the extent and depth of quality assurance activities.
Methods: Radiotherapy departments were voluntarily surveyed in three stages, firstly, in basic facility
information, secondly, in quality assurance activities and treatment techniques, and thirdly, in a snap-
shot of quality assurance, departmental and treatment activities.
Results: The IAEA received completed surveys from 381 radiotherapy departments throughout the
world with 100 radiotherapy departments completing all three surveys. Dominant patterns were found
in linac-based radiotherapy with access to treatment planning systems for 3D-CRT and 3D imaging.
Staffing levels for major staff groups were on average in the range recommended by the IAEA. The
modal patient workload per EBRT unit was as expected in the range of 21–30 patients per day, how-
ever significant instances of high workload (more than 50 patients per day per treatment unit) were
reported. Staffing levels were found to correlate with amount of treatment equipment and patient
workload. In a self-assessment of quality assurance performance, most radiotherapy departments
reported that they would perform at least 60% of the quality assurance activities itemized in the
second survey, with particular strength in equipment quality control. In a snapshot survey of quality
assurance performance, again equipment quality control practice was well developed, particularly for
the treatment equipment.
Conclusions: The IAEA surveys provide a snapshot of current radiotherapy practice including quality
assurance activities.

Introduction
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has consist-
ently stressed the importance of quality assurance activities
in radiotherapy for safe and effective patient treatment
through numerous publications [1–3] and this emphasis is
supported by national and regional professional societies
such
as
the
American
Society
for
Radiation
Oncology
(ASTRO),
the
European
Society
for
Radiotherapy
and
Oncology (ESTRO) and the American Association of Physicists
in Medicine (AAPM). Most recently, an IAEA publication on
accuracy and uncertainty in radiotherapy recommended the
implementation of a comprehensive quality assurance (QA)
program [4] for managing accuracy and uncertainty in the
clinic and resources such as IPEM Report 81 [5] provide guid-
ance on implementation of quality assurance.
Operating a quality assurance program involves staff time
and resources and management commitment. Quality assur-
ance is defined as that part of quality management related
to providing confidence that quality requirements will be
met [6] while quality assurance in radiotherapy has been
defined as all procedures that ensure the dose prescription is
met in terms of target dose and minimum dose to organs at
risk [7]. Quality control (QC), as a part of overall quality assur-
ance, is the process of measuring performance, comparing
with standards and maintaining performance [7]. Quality
assurance in radiotherapy is not just limited to routine check-
ing of the performance of equipment but involves a range of
additional activities (often multi-disciplinary) related to the
department, patient and equipment, such as incident report-
ing,
patient-specific
dosimetry
measurements,
and

patient planning meetings. Recent surveys of linear acceler-
ator quality control in the UK [8] and medical physics prac-
tice [9] focus on the role of the medical physicist. The aim of
this work was to survey the extent and depth of quality
assurance activities in radiotherapy departments, including
multi-disciplinary activities, around the world.
This work also presents the results of surveys of various
factors which may influence quality assurance effort such as
staffing levels, patient workload, amount of equipment and
complexity of treatment techniques.
Material and methods
The surveys on practice and quality assurance in radiother-
apy were designed in a series of three voluntary surveys. The
1st survey was the simplest, with respondents asked to pro-
vide basic facility details including staffing levels, amount
and type of radiotherapy equipment, and types of services
offered. The respondents were asked at the end of the sur-
vey if they wished to participate in a more detailed survey
on quality assurance. If they answered yes only then were
they sent the subsequent survey. The 2nd survey concen-
trated on quality assurance activities at a general level with
the respondent expected to self-assess as to whether particu-
lar quality assurance activities were conducted at their
department. The 2nd survey also focused on clinical techni-
ques with respondents asked to provide details of external
beam treatment techniques for four clinical scenarios: two
different head and neck cases, a breast case and a palliative
case. In the 3rd survey, the respondents were expected to
provide a snapshot of activities in the department in a
period of a month and in a single working day within that
month with emphasis on external beam radiotherapy. The
activities covered quality assurance and patient treatment.
For the 3rd survey, the month and day of the survey was
chosen by the IAEA officer collating the survey, not by the
department themselves, in order to prevent potential data
bias. Also, the date was set in the recent past so as to not
allow the department to modify their work procedures based
on the survey questions. For distribution of the 1st survey,
the survey form was sent to by the IAEA to medical physics
counterparts in countries throughout the world with a
request to distribute the 1st survey within their country. The
surveys were designed as a set of three surveys rather than
one comprehensive survey to encourage responses. It was
considered that radiotherapy departments would be more
likely to complete three shorter sequential surveys rather
than one large survey and even if the department did not
proceed to the 2nd survey or 3rd survey the information
obtained would still be useful.
A number of parameters pertinent to the radiotherapy
process were able to be extracted from the surveys including
staffing levels (1st survey), patient workload (3rd survey),
amount of equipment (1st and 3rd surveys), quality assur-
ance activities (2nd and 3rd surveys) and complexity of treat-
ment techniques offered (all surveys). Correlations between
various parameters were tested with the Pearson correlation
coefficient and a t-test for significance of the correlation at
the 1% level.
Results
The three surveys were distributed over 2014–2017. Given
the sequential nature of the surveys, the respondents to the
2nd survey are a subset of the respondents to the 1st survey
and the respondents to the 3rd survey are in turn a subset
of the respondents to the 2nd survey. Table 1 shows the
number of surveys collected, the distribution among geo-
graphical regions and the country income group based on
World Bank classification in 2017. 456 completed surveys
were received by the IAEA in 2014, 180 completed surveys
were received in 2015, while 24 completed surveys were
received over 2016–2017. Given that there are more than
7,000 radiotherapy departments worldwide according to
the IAEA database of radiotherapy equipment DIRAC [10],
the 381 departments who responded to the first survey
represent
approximately
5%
of
worldwide
radiotherapy
departments.
Staffing levels
Departments were surveyed for number of radiation oncolo-
gists (RO), medical physicists (MP), radiation therapists (RTT)
and dosimetrists (DM). The 1st survey made no distinction
between training positions and qualified positions; however,
departments were asked about any academic affiliation and
any training programs for medical physicists. The 1st survey
found 10,501 full-time-equivalent (FTE) staffing positions over
381 departments with 53% RTTs, 26% ROs, 17% MPs and 4%
DMs. Not surprisingly, staffing levels correlated strongly with
amount of equipment (p values less than .001). There were
on average 1.2 MPs per treatment unit, 1.8 ROs per treat-
ment unit and 3.4 RTTs per treatment unit, where both EBRT
and brachytherapy units are included in the definition of
treatment unit. Of the 381 departments, only 35% employed
dosimetrists, and at those departments there were on aver-
age 0.7 DMs per treatment unit and 1.1 MPs per treatment
unit, while for those departments without DMs there were
on average 1.3 MPs per treatment unit.
Departments that indicated they had an academic affili-
ation had a higher average number of staff per treatment

Treatment equipment
External-beam
radiotherapy
(EBRT)
treatment
equipment
recorded in the 1st survey was dominated by medical linear
accelerators (linacs) with 73% of all EBRT treatment units
being linacs (see Table 2) and 93% of departments having at
least one linac. However, other technology such as Cobalt-60
teletherapy and orthovoltage x-ray therapy is also utilized.
Specialized linacs such as dedicated stereotactic units and
Tomotherapy units were less widespread. Two thirds of
departments offered high dose rate brachytherapy, while low
dose rate brachytherapy, which would encompass different
sealed radioactive sources such as Cs-137, I-125 and Sr-90,
was less prevalent. The ratio of linacs to Cobalt-60 telether-
apy units is 6.6 to 1 and this value is very similar to the 6.0
to 1 ratio found in the IAEA DIRAC database [10].
Imaging equipment
Imaging for treatment planning was dominated by CT, with
98% of departments either having a dedicated CT simulator
in the department or having access to a CT scanner for
simulation. Conventional simulators were available in 45% of
departments. Access to MRI and PET-CT imaging was not as
prevalent as CT as shown in Table 2. Treatment room image
guidance was surveyed through asking whether Image-
Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT) was offered as a service and
59% of departments responded positively (see Table 2).
Treatment planning and network
Treatment planning system capability for 3D conformal
radiotherapy (3D-CRT) was widespread as shown in Table 2
but so also was inverse planning capability for IMRT in 79%
of departments from the 1st survey. Only four departments
did not have computerized treatment planning, and these
were all departments that only operated Cobalt-60 telether-
apy units. Networking in the form a record and verify system
was also prevalent with 89% of departments reporting this
capability in the 1st survey.
Patient workload
In the 3rd survey, respondents were asked to provide the
number of patients treated with EBRT on the selected day
and the number of EBRT units used to treat those patients. A
typical value of number of patients treated on an EBRT unit
in a day is 32, given an average of 15 min per patient [11]

and an 8-hour shift. The most common number of patients
treated per EBRT unit was in fact in the range from 21 to 30
patients per day (26 out of 100 departments) with next high-
est being 31 to 40 patients per day (20 departments).
Underutilization was not common with only 8 departments
reporting 20 patients, or fewer, treated per EBRT unit. More
common was heavy utilization with 20 departments treating
51 to 70 patients per day per EBRT unit and 11 departments
treating more than 70 patients per day per EBRT unit. In all
cases the higher workload was achieved with more than one
shift or a single shift longer than 8 h.
For those departments that completed all three surveys,
total patient workload from the 3rd survey correlated signifi-
cantly with total staffing levels (r ¼ 0.760) and medical phys-
ics staffing (r ¼ 0.730) from the 1st survey.
Treatment techniques
The 1st survey recorded the clinical services offered by each
department with 93% of departments offering 3D-CRT, 72%
of departments offering intensity modulated radiotherapy
(IMRT) and 37% of departments offering an SRS/SRT service,
as shown in Table 2.
The 2nd survey recorded treatment techniques for four
clinical scenarios: two different head and neck cases, namely
oropharynx and nasopharynx, a breast case and a palliative
bone metastasis case. The details of treatment technique,
modality and setup verification selected by departments are
presented in Table 3. For the two head and neck cases, IMRT
was the most commonly selected treatment technique, while
for the breast case 3D-CRT was most common (65%). For the
bone metastasis case, 2D and 3D-CRT were commonly
selected. Megavoltage photon beams was the most common
modality for all four cases, and 40% of departments used a
photon/electron beam combination for the breast case. The
EPID was widely selected for setup verification. For the head
and neck cases, kV CBCT imaging was selected in up to 35%
of departments. Imaging frequency was most commonly
selected as ‘weekly’ for the head and neck and breast cases,
while ‘first setup only’ was most commonly selected for the
bone metastasis case. In vivo dosimetry was selected in less
than 10% of departments.
The 3rd survey recorded treatment techniques for all
patients treated with EBRT on a selected day. Almost half of
all patients (49%) were treated with 3D-CRT with the next
most frequent being the IMRT technique at 23% as shown in
Table 2. Respondents were asked to randomly select 10
patients that were treated on the selected day and provide
further information as to their treatment. Again, in this
cohort of patients, the types of treatment were similarly
spread, 47% were treated with 3D-CRT and 26% with IMRT. It
is interesting to note the prevalence of IMRT in that in the
1st survey 79% of departments have IMRT treatment plan-
ning capability and 72% have IMRT in clinical use. In the 2nd
survey, 63% of departments indicated they would use IMRT
for a head and neck case and 13% for a breast case, and in

the 3rd survey, 23% of all patients across all departments
were treated with IMRT.
Quality assurance extent and depth
The 2nd survey asked a series of yes/no questions on various
aspects of quality assurance covering department, patient
and equipment quality activities. This is essentially a self-
assessment on the extent of quality assurance activities in
each radiotherapy department. A QA score was created by
equally weighting the answers to the 34 questions including
14 questions on departmental QA, 3 questions on equipment
QC and 17 questions on patient treatment QC. 175 out of
179 departments indicated that they performed more than
60% of the QA activities included in the survey, as shown in
Figure 1(a). 163 out of 179 departments indicated that they
performed more than 80% of the equipment QC activities
Figure 1. Normalized QA scores based on (a) responses to 34 questions from the 2nd survey and (b) responses to 33 questions from the 3rd survey indicating per-
formance of the specific QA test in the designated month.

including acceptance testing, commissioning and quality
control baseline tests. There was a greater variation in scores
among departments for departmental QA and patient QC as
also shown in Figure 1(a).
The 3rd snapshot survey of quality assurance performance
in a selected month was an opportunity to confirm the self-
assessment of quality assurance activities reported in the
2nd survey. It was found that the departmental QA and
patient QC scores reported in the 2nd survey correlated sig-
nificantly with those from the 3rd survey with Pearson correl-
ation coefficients 0.513 and 0.467 respectively. However,
there were instances of low scores for departmental QA
activities in the 3rd survey as shown in Figure 1(b).
Equipment QC effort was also found from the 3rd survey.
The departments were asked if they performed a number of
QC tests in a selected month or a selected day within that
month for treatment equipment, imaging equipment and
ancillary equipment. The QC tests in the 3rd survey were
taken from those listed as recommended daily, weekly or
monthly by the IAEA [1], AAPM TG 142 [12] and AAPM TG 66
[13]. For example, 16 different QC tests were listed in the 3rd
survey for a Cobalt-60 teletherapy unit. Of the 17 depart-
ments that had at least one Cobalt-60 teletherapy unit, the
median number of tests performed on the selected day was
5 out 16 QC tests, and the median number of tests per-
formed during the selected month or selected day was 15
out of 16 QC tests. Parameters for the number of QC tests
performed, including minimum, maximum, median, average
and sample standard deviation for the radiotherapy depart-
ments surveyed, are shown in Table 4 for various types of
equipment. The data for the linear accelerator is complicated
by the fact that there are optional items such as MLC, imag-
ing panels and electron beams. In this case, a percentage of
the total number of QC tests expected based on the equip-
ment configuration is presented in Table 4. Median and aver-
age number of QC tests performed in the month were close
to the total number of QC tests in the 3rd survey for each
type of equipment. For example, for the orthovoltage unit,
the mean number of tests performed with the selected
month, or on the selected day within that month, was 9.0,
the average was 8.0 and total number of QC tests in the sur-
vey was 10. Of interest is the lower median score for the
conventional simulator QC tests, where the median score
was 12 out of 17 QC tests performed in the selected month
or selected day. In this case, the median score was affected
by low scores for image quality tests and radiography/fluor-
oscopy system tests.
A large number of departments (61 out of 100) reported
performing dosimetry equipment QC in the selected day or
month including any of cross-calibration, check source read-
ings
and
linearity/leakage/recombination
checks.
QC
of
patient aids was indicated in the selected month or selected
day in 45 out of 100 departments, while 67 out of 86 depart-
ments indicated performing QC on the record and verify sys-
tem in the selected month or selected day. Some gaps in QC
performance were found for the CT simulator, the record
and
verify
system
and
patient
aids
in
that
not
all
departments performed QC tests on these items within the
selected month (Table 2).
As part of departmental quality assurance, the 2nd survey
included questions about audits. 41% of departments indi-
cated that they perform internal audits, 39% indicated that
they participate in comprehensive external audits and 85%
had participated in dosimetry audits within the last two
years. In the snapshot 3rd survey, 35% of departments indi-
cated that they had performed an internal audit in the
selected month and 24% had participated in a dosimetry
audit in the selected month.
Discussion
The staffing levels found in the 1st survey can be compared
with IAEA recommendations [11] from an activity-based algo-
rithm. In the worked examples in that publication are calcu-
lated staffing levels from standard to advanced departments.
The number of ROs per treatment unit was from 1.3 to 1.8,
the number of MPs (including DMs) per treatment unit was
from 1.1 to 3.0, and the number of RTTs per treatment unit
was from 2.2 to 4.9. It is noted that the average number of
MPs from the 1st survey of 1.2 per treatment unit is at the
low end of the recommended range, while the numbers of
RTTs and ROs are commensurate with the IAEA calculations.

The prevalence or IMRT has been noted already, however
of note were 59 radiotherapy departments who offered IMRT
without IGRT. Given the need for reproducible and accurate
patient positioning for intensity modulated radiotherapy
delivery, it is expected that IMRT would only be delivered
with the support of IGRT [14]. Similarly, 10 radiotherapy
departments indicated that they offered stereotactic radio-
surgery/stereotactic
radiotherapy
(SRS/SRT)

offering IGRT, however in these cases invasive frame based
SRS is likely used without the need for IGRT.
The surveys aimed to elucidate levels of quality assurance
activity in radiotherapy practice. The surveys indicated mostly
high levels of quality assurance performance from the
respondents, particularly in the area of equipment QC, both
by self-assessment (Figure 1(a)) and through a snapshot of
performance (Figure 1(b) and Table 3). Whether these survey
results represent worldwide application of QA recommenda-
tions is unclear given the suspected bias in that those
departments performing higher levels of QA were probably
more likely to respond to the survey. However, it is inferred
that the consistent message from the IAEA and relevant pro-
fessional societies of the need for quality assurance in radio-
therapy for patient safety as well as quality of patient
treatment is being heeded.
Some of the findings of these surveys can be compared
with a recent medical physics practice survey by Kisling et al.
[9]. The survey investigated the practice of medical physicists
and dosimetrists. One interesting finding was the use of in-
vivo dosimetry by 47% of departments [9] and 50% of
departments (IAEA, 2nd survey, patient QC). Dosimetry sys-
tem constancy checks were found to be performed monthly
in 19% of departments [9] and 27% of departments (IAEA)
while Kisling et al. [9] found 72% of departments do these
tests annually or at 6-month intervals. Patient workload was
similar in that the modal workload was in the range of
21–30 patients per day per treatment unit but there was
greater level of high patient workload (31% of departments
with more than 50 patients/day) in the current survey com-
pared to 8% more than 40 patients/day in [9].
It is noted that the survey forms themselves have some
limitations which could be addressed in any future surveys.
The surveys did not distinguish between staff in training and
fully qualified staff, nor were vacant staffing positions sur-
veyed.
The
term
‘image
guided
radiotherapy’
was
not
defined in the surveys and its definition is open to interpret-
ation. The survey forms did not consider VMAT separately
from IMRT, it was assumed that VMAT practice was included
in responses to questions regarding IMRT. The 2nd and 3rd
surveys concentrated on treatment techniques and quality
assurance in external beam radiotherapy rather than brachy-
therapy. The surveys of quality control tests did not allow
the possibility for the respondent to choose quarterly or
annually for any of the QC tests. Given that some depart-
ments will likely have decided on for quarterly or annual fre-
quency of some tests, and annual equipment QC tests
recommended by the IAEA and AAPM were not included in
the 3rd survey, then these surveys will likely not capture all
of the QA activities being performed within a year. QC tests
for motion management equipment was not included in the
list for the linear accelerator or CT simulator. Finally, the sur-
veys did not include any questions on the possible use of
risk assessment [15] or failure modes and effects analysis [16]
for devising the local QA program.
The survey forms themselves provide an excellent audit
tool for radiotherapy departments in examining the strength
of their quality assurance program in the broad areas related
to the department, equipment and the patient, and this
audit tool is consistent with the IAEA QUATRO audit pro-
cess [2].
The survey results presented here stand alone as an inter-
esting snapshot of recent worldwide radiotherapy practice.
For selected radiotherapy departments, the IAEA’s coordi-
nated research project E24017 followed up the surveys with
end-to-end dosimetry tests. This was intended to link the
quality assurance assessment of the surveys with perform-
ance in simulated radiation therapy practice. The results of
the
end-to-end
tests
will
be
presented
in
a
future
publication.
