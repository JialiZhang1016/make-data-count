Abstract
1.	 Organic farming has potential for the conservation of global biodiversity and as-
sociated ecosystem services. Despite this, knowledge of the effects of organic 
farming systems on farmland biodiversity is limited in Asia, the worldwide leader 
in rice production.
2.	 We conducted the first national‐scale study to investigate the effects of three 
different rice farming systems (conventional, low‐input and organic) and specific 
management practices (e.g. herbicide and insecticide applications, crop rotation 
and levee‐vegetation management) on species richness and abundance of mul-
tiple taxonomic groups (plants, invertebrates, Pelophylax and Hyla japonica frogs, 
cobitid loaches and birds) in Japan during 2013–2015.
3.	 Organic fields supported the highest richness and abundance of several taxonomic 
groups (native/Red List plants, Tetragnatha spiders, Sympetrum dragonflies and 
Pelophylax frogs), followed by low‐input and conventional fields. We also found 
taxon‐specific responses to specific management practices. For instance, plant 
richness and Tetragnatha and Sympetrum abundance increased with reduced her-
bicide and/or insecticide applications. Sympetrum and cobitid loach abundance in-
creased in the absence of crop rotation, whereas H. japonica abundance increased 
with crop rotation. Pelophylax abundance increased with an increased height of 
levee vegetation.
4.	 At spatial scales larger than single fields, waterbird richness and abundance were 
positively correlated with the proportion of organic rice fields, presumably due 
to increased prey abundance. Meanwhile, landbird richness and abundance were 
positively associated with annual precipitation and annual mean temperature, 
suggesting that such climate increases food availability.
5.	 Synthesis and applications. We highlight the positive effects of organic and 
low‐input farming for biodiversity relative to conventional farming in rice pad-
dies. We also provide the scientific basis of the current agri‐environmental 
schemes in Japan, subsidising organic and low‐input farming for biodiversity. The

1 | INTRODUCTION
Agriculture is among the most serious threats to biodiversity across 
the globe (Newbold et al., 2015). The world's growing population is ex-
pected to exceed nine billion people by 2050, which poses a critical 
challenge to the conservation of global biodiversity while maintaining 
food security (Godfray et al., 2010). One promising approach to this 
goal is organic agriculture, which avoids the use of agrochemicals to re-
duce the negative impacts of agriculture on the environment. Studies 
have shown that organic farming supports higher richness and abun-
dance of organisms than conventional farming does (e.g. Bengtsson, 
Ahnstrom, & Weibull, 2005; Lichtenberg et al., 2017; Tuck et al., 2014). 
Such wildlife‐friendly farming practices are also expected to play a 
crucial role in food production because some organisms on the farm 
support essential ecosystem services, such as pollination and pest con-
trol (Tscharntke et al., 2012). Enhanced‐ecosystem services associated 
with farmland biodiversity may thus enable wildlife‐friendly farming to 
be more sustainable compared with conventional agriculture.
The paucity of data on wildlife benefits of organic farming in re-
gions other than Europe and North America poses a major knowledge 
gap (Seufert & Ramankutty, 2017). Organic farming now takes place on 
1.1% of global agricultural lands, comprising many parts of the world: 
Oceania (45% of global organic agricultural land), Europe (25%), Latin 
America (13%), North America (6%), Asia (6%) and Africa (3%; table 
2 in Willer & Lernoud, 2017). However, studies on the wildlife bene-
fits of organic farming have been heavily biased towards Europe and 
North America, comprising more than 90% of the earlier studies (Tuck 
et al., 2014). Thus, for many other regions and the agricultural systems 
therein, there is currently limited information regarding the reported 
positive effects of organic farming on biodiversity (e.g. Bengtsson et 
al., 2005; Tuck et al., 2014). Filling this knowledge gap would enable a 
more balanced and global assessment of the effects of organic farm-
ing on the biodiversity and associated ecosystem services.
Asia is an important region in terms of high‐biodiversity value, 
where one‐third of the 35 global hotspots of biodiversity are in-
cluded (Mittermeier, Turner, Larsen, Brooks, & Gascon, 2011). Asia is 
also the world's leading producer of rice, contributing 87.9% of total 
rice production (FAO, 2016). Rice has been the primary staple food 
of more than half of the world's population, providing over 20% of 
the daily calories for more than 3.5 billion people (Dawe, Pandey, 
& Nelson, 2010). Rice fields, which are usually flood‐irrigated or 
rain‐fed during at least the growing season of rice plants (Maclean et 
al., 2013), provide habitats for a variety of wildlife species, including 
aquatic plants, invertebrates, frogs, fish and birds, in many parts of 
the world (Elphick, Baicich, Parsons, Fasola, & Mugica, 2010; Lawler, 
2001). Since the late 20th century, however, agricultural intensifica-
tion has threatened these rice paddy organisms (Bambaradeniya & 
Amerasinghe, 2004). Considering future increases in population and 
the associated economic growth in Asia (Laurance, Sayer, & Cassman, 
2014), there is an urgent need to find alternatives to conventional 
farming to halt the loss of biodiversity in Asian rice paddies.
Growing evidence suggests positive effects of organic farming 
and less strict low‐input farming (i.e. reduced use of agrochemicals) 
for biodiversity relative to conventional farming in rice paddies (e.g. 
Baba, Kusumoto, & Tanaka, 2018; Ibáñez, Curcó, Riera, Ripoll, & 
Sánchez, 2010; Wilson, Watts, & Stevens, 2008). Low‐input systems 
are expected to provide lower wildlife benefits and higher yield on 
a per‐area basis than organic ones do, which can be important for 
improving biodiversity over large areas (Elphick et al., 2010). Other 
studies have focused on specific management practices such as ag-
rochemical use, water management and vegetation in the levee (e.g. 
Amano et al., 2011; Elphick, 2004; Settle et al., 1996). However, the 
relative importance of overall farming systems and specific practices, 
especially for multiple taxonomic groups, has rarely been quantified. 
Quantifying taxon‐specific responses to farming systems and prac-
tices would enable understanding the strengths and limitations of 
specific farming systems or practices for biodiversity. This is also rel-
evant to policy‐making because some organic and low‐input farming 
systems, often combined with specific practices (e.g. winter flood-
ing), are subsidized through agri‐environment schemes for biodiver-
sity conservation (Ibáñez et al., 2010; Katayama, Baba, Kusumoto, 
& Tanaka, 2015), and an efficient allocation of subsidies to farming 
systems or practices that might provide wildlife benefits is critical.
Here, we present the first multi‐taxon study exploring the effects of 
organic and low‐input rice farming systems and associated management 
practices at the national scale by surveying more than 1,000 rice fields 
during 2013–2015 across Japan. Low‐input farming was defined as rice 
cultivation using 50% or less of the chemical pesticide/fertilizer inputs 
of conventional farming in each prefecture (Usio, Saito, Akanuma, & 
Watanabe, 2014). This study focused on five taxonomic groups (plants, 
invertebrates, frogs, fish and birds), all of which have attracted much 
attention for their conservation values and for the ecosystem services 
taxon‐specific associations with management practices indicate that avoiding crop 
rotation, maintaining levee vegetation and organic farming at large spatial scales 
can also be wildlife friendly. These practices may thus be incorporated into agri‐
environment schemes for effective biodiversity conservation.

they provide, such as pest control and nutrient cycling (Katayama, Baba, 
et al., 2015). We specifically addressed two questions. First, how do 
farming practices (e.g. agrochemical inputs, crop rotation, first flood‐ir-
rigation date) differ among the three rice farming systems (conventional, 
low‐input and organic)? Second, what farming systems or practices bet-
ter explain the richness or abundance of each taxon?
2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS
We provide an overview of methods here; further details on study 
fields, variable selection and sampling schemes are described in 
Appendix S1 and Figure S1.
2.1 | Field surveys
This study was carried out in Japan on 28 paired sites of conventional 
and conservation blocks from 2013 to 2015 (Figure 1, left panel). 
Each pair of sites was more than 10 km apart, except for one pair 
(5 km). Conservation blocks contained variable amounts of organic/
low‐input rice farming, certified by local and national governments 
[on average, 24.5% (range: 3.2%–41.1%)]. Conventional blocks con-
tained <1.0% of organic/low‐input rice farming, except for one site 
(13.3% in the conventional block vs. 23.3% in the conservation 
block). Each site was surveyed for 1–3 years during 2013–2015; in 
every year, 1–10 fields were chosen as surveyed fields in each block 
(Figure 1, right). In total, 1,074 rice fields (541 conventional, 238 low‐
input, and 295 organic fields) were surveyed during the 3 years. The 
proportional forest cover surrounding each field and field size dif-
fered little among the three farming systems (Table S1).
Seven representative taxonomic groups in rice fields were sur-
veyed by field experts in each site during the rice‐growing season 
(May–August; Table 1). All taxa were surveyed at the field level 
(within the field for plants, invertebrates and fish, and in levees for 
frogs), except birds, which were recorded at the block level (as point 
counts covered multiple fields). For plants, we used observed rich-
ness due to the same number of samples (three quadrats) in each 
field. For arthropods, Tetragnatha spiders, Sympetrum dragonflies 
and Coleoptera were chosen as key indicator animals for evaluat-
ing wildlife benefits of organic/low‐input farming; their abundance, 
not species richness, was calculated because species identification 
was insufficient in several sites. For frogs and fish, because the 
number of species observed in each field was generally very low 
(fewer than three species), the abundance of the dominant species 
groups was calculated. Rarefied bird richness was calculated to 
control for survey effort differences among blocks. Each taxonomic 
group was mostly sampled within a week in the paired conventional 
and organic/low‐input fields. We explicitly considered the effects 
of the differences in survey effort and number of surveyed fields 
among farming systems, taxonomic groups, and sites on our results 
(Appendix S2).
2.2 | Environmental data
Information on farming practices and rice yields in each field was 
collected through farmer interviews. We selected ‘biologically 
reasonable’ variables at the field and block scales (Tables 2 and 3) 
for each taxon (Table 1) according to the findings of previous stud-
ies (Appendix S1). At the field scale, the farming system category 
was considered to represent the effects of overall management

practices associated with each system, including their additive 
and synergistic effects. Flood‐irrigation dates indicate the timing 
when temporal aquatic habitats (i.e. flooded rice fields) were cre-
ated. Young rice plants are transplanted in flooded fields, which 
are kept flooded until mid‐summer drainage. Winter flooding is 
usually combined with straw incorporation. At the block scale, five 
variables (ORG, ORLO, FORE, TEMP and PREC) were calculated 
as their average values at the corresponding scale of all surveyed 
points for bird counts in each block. Vegetation height was not 
included owing to missing data in several sites. All the continuous 
variables were standardized (zero mean, unit standard deviation) 
before analyses.

(LMMs) for continuous variables and generalized LMMs (GLMMs) 
with a binomial error structure and logit link for categorical vari-
ables. Continuous variables were log‐transformed to normalize their 
distributions; effects of normality assumptions on model estimates 
were also tested (Appendix S3). The explanatory variables were 
FARM and YEAR (see Table 2). The random variable was site ID (as-
signed to each of 28 sites); field ID (assigned to each of the 709 dif-
ferent fields because several fields were surveyed for multiple years) 
was not included owing to the problem of model convergence. For 
each response variable, the differences between each pair of the 
three farming systems were tested using post hoc Tukey HSD tests.
2.3.2 | Relationships among biodiversity and 
environmental factors
GLMMs and an information theoretic approach to model selection 
and multi‐model inference were used to examine the relationships 
among species richness or abundance of each taxon (Table 1) and 
environmental factors (Tables 2 and 3; see Tables S2 and S3 for the 
correlation coefficients). Log‐transformed survey effort was used as 
the offset term for abundance to model their densities. The random 
variables were site ID and field ID at the field scale, and site ID at the 
block scale. We used four families of distributions (Poisson, negative 
binomial, zero‐inflated Poisson and zero‐inflated negative binomial), 
and for each distribution, we fitted the full model and all submod-
els containing different combinations of predictors. We ranked all 
submodels across the four distributions according to their corrected 
Akaike's information criterion (AICc; Burnham & Anderson, 2002). 
To address multicollinearity, we excluded submodels with variance 
inflation factor >3 (Appendix S4). We then calculated Akaike weights 
(wi) in each model, the sum of Akaike weights (SW), model‐averaged 
coefficients and associated unconditional standard errors for each 
predictor (Appendix S4). An additional analysis was conducted to 
compare richness and abundance between each farming‐system pair 
(Appendix S5). Spatial correlograms of model residuals showed no 
strong spatial autocorrelation (Appendix S6). A list of R packages is 
shown in Appendix S7.
3 | RESULTS
3.1 | Taxonomic diversity in rice paddies
Field surveys in the flood‐irrigation periods (from spring to summer) 
identified 69 native species, including 27 Red List species of plants 
in 767 rice fields; 5,302 Tetragnatha spiders, including seven species 
in 437 fields; 6,352 Sympetrum dragonfly nymphs of five species in 
456 fields; 3,054 Coleoptera larvae of 35 species in 497 fields; 2,900 
Pelophylax frogs of three species in 433 fields; 5,613 Hyla japonica 
frogs in 433 fields; 1,135 Cobitidae loaches in 343 fields; 20 water-
bird species, including 968 individuals; and 21 landbird species, in-
cluding 1,790 individuals. The numbers of non‐native species were 
eight for plants, one for frogs, two for fish and one for birds. Species 
lists are shown in Tables S4–S6.

Tables S7 and S8). Compared to low‐input and organic farming, con-
ventional farming was characterized by higher frequency of herbicide/
insecticide applications and higher rice yield (+14%, +43%). Organic 
farming was denoted by no use of chemical pesticides, 29% lower crop 
rotation frequency, 26% higher winter flooding frequency, 11 days ear-
lier flood irrigation dates and 6 cm higher vegetation height on levees, 
although robust LMMs showed no significant difference in flood‐ir-
rigation dates (Table S7). Low‐input farming was intermediate but 
showed the latest flood‐irrigation date.
3.3 | Farming practices and wildlife diversity
Model selection showed that no single model of richness or abun-
dance was clearly superior to others for any taxonomic group 
(Table S9). For native and Red List plant richness, farming sys-
tem had large SW (>0.99, Figure 3a,b), with richness decreasing 
in the order of organic, low‐input and conventional fields (Tables 
S10 and S11). Herbicide applications also had large SW (>0.99, 
Figure 3a,b), with negative coefficients and small standard errors 
(Figure 4a,b).
For Tetragnatha abundance, farming system had large SW 
(>0.99, Figure 3c), with higher abundance in organic and low‐
input fields than in conventional ones (Tables S10 and S11). 
Herbicide and insecticide applications also had large SW (0.99 
and 0.71, Figure 3c) and were negatively associated with spider

For Pelophylax abundance, farming system had the largest SW 
(0.83, Figure 3f), with higher abundance in organic fields than in con-
ventional ones (Tables S10 and S11). Vegetation height also had large 
SW (0.77, Figure 3f) and was positively associated with frog abun-
dance (Figure 4f, see also Figure S2a). For H. japonica abundance, SW 
was large for vegetation height, its quadratic term, and crop rotation 
(>0.95, Figure 3g); model averaging showed a positive association 
with crop rotation and nonlinear association with vegetation height 
(Figure 4g), with its peak at 10–20 cm (Figure S2b). For Cobitidae 
abundance, crop rotation and flood‐irrigation date had large SW 
(>0.97, Figure 3h), with strong negative correlations (Figure 4h).
For waterbird richness and abundance, the proportion of organic 
farming had the largest SW (0.79 and 0.98, Figure 3i,j), with positive 
associations (Figure 4i,j) up to 40% (Figure 5). In addition, the abso-
lute values of standardized coefficients were greater for tempera-
ture (and forest cover for richness; Figure 4i,j). For landbird richness 
and abundance, precipitation had the largest SW (>0.93, Figure 3k, 
l) and the largest positive associations (Figure 4k,l), followed by tem-
perature and flood‐irrigation date for abundance.
4 | DISCUSSION
The three farming systems differed in both management practices 
(i.e. pesticide applications, crop rotation, winter flooding and veg-
etation height in levees) and biodiversity. Among the three farming 
systems, organic farming supported the highest richness and abun-
dance in many taxonomic groups at multiple spatial scales (native/
Red List plants, Tetragnatha, Sympetrum, Pelophylax and waterbirds), 
followed by low‐input and conventional ones. To our knowledge, this 
is the first study quantifying taxon‐specific associations with farm-
ing systems and practices, showing that no single system or practice 
could satisfactorily explain the richness and abundance of entire 
taxonomic groups.

4.1 | Relationships among biodiversity and 
environmental factors
The high native/Red List plant richness in organic fields, followed by 
low‐input and conventional fields, was best explained by herbicide 
application differences. In this regard, laboratory experiments have 
shown the adverse effects of herbicides on the growth of threat-
ened aquatic ferns (e.g. Aida, Ikeda, Itoh, & Usui, 2006), and, con-
sistently, the findings of the present study indicate that herbicide 
use is the most detrimental factor affecting plant diversity in agricul-
tural fields. Moreover, although not quantified in the present study, 
chemical fertilizer use in conventional fields may also be detrimen-
tal, especially for rare plant species preferring wet and oligotrophic 
habitats (Uematsu & Ushimaru, 2013).
The high Tetragnatha abundance in organic and low‐input fields 
seemed to be mainly due to both reduced herbicide and insecticide 
applications to nursery boxes. Herbicide applications may have af-
fected these spiders directly or indirectly through changes in prey 
abundance (Amano et al., 2011). However, because the spiders were 
not directly exposed to the insecticides applied in nursery boxes, 
the negative insecticide effect likely arose from reduced prey avail-
ability, such as flying insects emerging from paddy water (Baba et 
al., 2018; Tsutsui, Tanaka, Baba, & Miyashita, 2016), although bio-
accumulation was also possible for insecticides like fipronil (Chaton, 
Ravanel, Tissut, & Meyran, 2002). In contrast to the observations 
reported by Takada, Takagi, Iwabuchi, Mineta, and Washitani (2014), 
we identified no clear benefit of winter flooding, which may be de-
pendent on actual prey abundance and surrounding landscapes.
Sympetrum abundance was better explained by the negative 
associations with crop rotation and insecticide applications than 
by the positive association with organic farming. In Sympetrum 
dragonfly life cycles, eggs deposited on wet mud in rice fields be-
fore/after harvest in autumn overwinter on the soil surface and 
hatch immediately when water is poured into the paddies in spring 
(Jinguji, Tashiro, Sato, Tsuyuzaki, & Kondo, 2006). Aridification and 
intensive tillage, as for crop rotation with upland crops, therefore 
seem to be detrimental for their survival. Moreover, neonicotinoid 
or phenylpyrazole insecticides are known to be highly toxic to 
Odonata nymphs, reducing their abundance (Jinguji, Thuyet, 
Uéda, & Watanabe, 2013).
Neither farming system nor practice explained the coleopteran 
larval abundance, which may be explained by their high tolerance 
to water pollution relative to other aquatic invertebrates (Chang, 
Lawrence, Rios‐Touma, & Resh, 2014). Earlier studies found a higher 
diversity or abundance of invertebrates in organic fields than in con-
ventional fields (Hesler, Grigarick, Oraze, & Palrang, 1993; Wilson 
et al., 2008) and detrimental effects of pesticide use on arthropod 
diversity (Settle et al., 1996), suggesting higher benefits to other 
aquatic invertebrate species for reduced pesticide applications. 
In contrast to the findings of previous studies (e.g. Lawler & Dritz, 
2005), we found that winter flooding also has no clear benefit, which 
seems to be due to high variations in the water cover among fields in 
Japan (Usio et al., 2014).
Pelophylax abundance was best explained by organic farming, 
suggesting the importance of overall effects of management prac-
tices associated with the system, including less‐intensive vegetation 
management in levees. Since Pelophylax frogs inhabit waterbodies 
such as rice fields and adjacent ditches throughout the year (Naito, 
Sakai, Natuhara, Morimoto, & Shibata, 2013), the species is likely 
to benefits from habitat improvement within and adjacent fields 
through increased prey abundance by disuse of pesticides and pred-
ator avoidance by tall vegetation in levees connecting fields and 
ditches.
In contrast, H. japonica abundance was not influenced by or-
ganic farming and rather high in fields with crop rotation. Unlike 
Pelophylax, these frogs have adapted to temporally flooded habitats 
to avoid aquatic predators (Iwata & Fujioka, 2006), and use drier hab-
itats such as grasslands and trees during the non‐breeding seasons 
(Naito et al., 2013), implying that crop rotation sites provide suitable 
habitat heterogeneity for these frogs. Their high abundance with 
short vegetation (~20 cm: Figure S2) was also reported for juveniles 
(Naito et al., 2013). However, there is no clear evidence showing why 
the intermediate vegetation height supports their high abundance.
Cobitidae abundance was high in fields without crop rotation and 
with earlier flood‐irrigation. The negative association with crop ro-
tation indicates the importance of overwintering conditions. Loach 
individuals overwinter under the ground of rice fields or in adjacent 
ditches (Tawa, Nakanishi, Murakami, Nishida, & Sawada, 2013) and 
thus their survival were likely to compromised by aridification and 
intensive tillage. The negative flood‐irrigation date association sug-
gests that earlier flooding dates allow more loach individuals to enter 
and spawn in the fields over the flooding period (Katayama, Saitoh, 
Amano, & Miyashita, 2011).
Higher waterbird richness and abundance in blocks with a higher 
proportion of organic fields indicate the importance of food avail-
ability at spatial scales larger than single fields, as reported earlier 
(e.g. Ibáñez et al., 2010; Lane & Fujioka, 1998). Our direct observa-
tions also found that Great egrets achieved higher food intake rates 
in organic fields than in conventional ones (Katayama, Murayama, 
& Mashiko, 2015). Considering that egrets and herons during their

breeding seasons are known to fly long distances for foraging (often 
>10 km: Custer & Galli, 2002), the benefits of organic farming on 
waterbirds may be even greater at larger spatial scales than that at 
the block scale.
As many landbirds utilize levees and dry farmlands rather than 
flooded rice fields in agricultural landscapes (Amano et al., 2008), 
the positive associations of these birds with annual precipitation and 
temperature in the present study indicate that such climate provides 
higher terrestrial food abundance, such as invertebrates (e.g. Amano 
et al., 2011). Higher landbird abundance in blocks with later flood‐ir-
rigation dates can be explained by the increase in their suitable hab-
itats, that is, unflooded rice fields, in the landscape (Elphick, 2004).
4.2 | Conservation implications and 
future directions
Our findings indicate the positive effects of organic farming on 
biodiversity in Japanese rice paddies relative to conventional farm-
ing, similar to rice paddies in Oceania, North and Central America, 
Western and Southern Europe, and Eastern and South‐Eastern Asia 
(e.g. Cochard, Maneepitak, & Kumar, 2014; Hesler et al., 1993; Ibáñez 
et al., 2010; Kumar, Kumar, McCoy Colton, Springer, & Trama, 2013; 
Wilson et al., 2008), as well as in dry farmlands such as for wheat, 
vegetable and fruit cultivation (e.g. Katayama, Bouam, Koshida, & 
Baba, 2019; Tuck et al., 2014). Given the large areas of land currently 
under agricultural production, our findings suggest the potential role 
of organic farming in reducing the continued loss of biodiversity in 
both terrestrial and aquatic agricultural ecosystems. Nevertheless, 
the overall benefits of organic farming for biodiversity need to be 
carefully considered; rice fields may be unsuitable for some wetland 
species, and reduced yield from organic farming may trigger conver-
sion of natural wetlands into rice production (Elphick et al., 2010). To 
date, however, there have been no studies that have demonstrated 
a direct link between organic rice production and the expansion 
of conventional high‐input rice production. Therefore, effective 
conservation policies for aquatic diversity should be implemented 
through holistic measures, including organic and wildlife‐friendly 
farming, fallow flooding, resuming abandoned paddies and protect-
ing natural wetlands (Koshida & Katayama, 2018; Maltchik, Stenert, 
& Batzer, 2017). Further research is needed on trade‐offs between 
farm scale biodiversity and yield and yield stability. Such wildlife‐
friendly systems may vary considerably with region according to 
the differences in landscape, climate and trophic interactions, which 
are also known to shape biological communities in rice agroecosys-
tems (e.g. Amano et al., 2011; Dominik, Seppelt, Horgan, Settele, & 
Václavík, 2018).
Our results also provide three implications for current agri‐envi-
ronmental schemes in Japan. First, we provided scientific evidence 
of the effectiveness of subsidies to organic and low‐input rice farm-
ing for biodiversity by local and national governments in Japan, 
although it should be assumed that low‐input farming is beneficial 
only to taxonomic groups sensitive to agrochemical use (e.g. plants, 
spiders and dragonflies). Ongoing support to farmers practicing 
organic/low‐input farming, combined with the conservation of re-
maining natural wetlands, would be crucial for regional biodiversity. 
Second, we identified farming practices other than agrochemical re-
duction, which could improve biodiversity, such as avoiding crop ro-
tation and maintaining levee vegetation. These practices should thus 
be the subject of agri‐environment schemes in paddy fields. Finally, 
spatially aggregating organic farming can improve conservation 
benefits for waterbird populations. Therefore, collective actions of 
neighbouring farmers for practicing wildlife‐friendly farming should 
be encouraged by financial incentives to farmers' groups.
