Resumo
Introdução: A pré-eclâmpsia é uma complicação séria durante 
a gravidez que não apenas influencia a saúde física da mãe e 
do feto, mas também tem consequências para a saúde mental 
materna, por exemplo ansiedade. A ansiedade pré-natal tem 
efeitos negativos e de longo prazo sobre a saúde mental da mãe 
antes e após o parto, sobre o parto, assim como sobre a saúde 
mental em gestações subsequentes.
Objetivo: Investigar a eficácia do aconselhamento psicoeducacional 
individual com relação aos níveis de ansiedade em gestantes com 
pré-eclâmpsia.
Métodos: Este foi um estudo randomizado, controlado, que 
envolveu dois hospitais governamentais na cidade de Sirjan, 
Kerman, de 30 de janeiro de 2017 a 31 de março de 2017. Um total 
de 42 gestantes com pré-eclâmpsia foram avaliadas. As mulheres 
foram randomicamente divididas em dois grupos: controle (n=22) 
e intervenção (n=22). A intervenção consistiu de duas sessões de 
aconselhamento psicoeducacional individual. O nível de ansiedade 
foi medido usando-se o Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory 
(STAI) antes da primeira sessão (pré-teste) e após a segunda 
seção (pós-teste), durante o período de hospitalização. 
Resultados: Houve uma redução significativa no nível de 
ansiedade após as sessões de aconselhamento no grupo 
intervenção (p<0,005). Além disso, houve um discreto aumento 
no nível de ansiedade no grupo controle após o estudo. 
Conclusão: De acordo com os resultados deste estudo, o 
aconselhamento psicoeducacional pode reduzir de forma 
significativa o nível de ansiedade em gestantes com pré-
eclâmpsia. Assim, recomenda-se que os profissionais de saúde 
ofereçam esse tipo de intervenção terapêutica para gestantes 
após a hospitalização, a fim de reduzir o nível de ansiedade e 
seus desfechos negativos.

Abstract
Introduction: Preeclampsia is a serious complication during 
pregnancy that not only influences maternal and fetal physical 
health, but also has maternal mental health outcomes such as 
anxiety. Prenatal anxiety has negative short- and long-term 
effects on pre- and postpartum maternal mental health, delivery, 
and mental health in subsequent pregnancies.
Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of individual psycho-
educational counseling on anxiety in pregnant women with 
preeclampsia.
Methods: This was a randomized, intervention-controlled study 
involving two governmental hospitals in the municipality of 
Sirjan, Kerman, from January 30 2017 to March 31 2017. A total 
of 44 pregnant women with preeclampsia were assessed. The 
women were randomized into two groups: control (n=22) and 
intervention (n=22). The intervention consisted of two sessions 
of individual psycho-educational counseling. The level of anxiety 
was measured using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory 
(STAI) as pretest before the first session and as posttest after 
the second session during the hospitalization period. 
Results: There was a significant reduction in the anxiety 
level after the counselling sessions in the intervention group 
(p<0.005). In addition, there was a slight increase in the anxiety 
level in the control group after the study. 
Conclusion: According to the results, psycho-educational 
counseling can significantly reduce the anxiety level in pregnant 
women with preeclampsia. Therefore, it is recommended that 
healthcare providers provide this type of therapeutic intervention 
for pregnant women after hospitalization, in order to reduce their 
anxiety level and its subsequent negative outcomes.

Introduction
Pregnancy is usually considered a happy phase 
of the woman’s life.1 This physiological and natural 
phenomenon is a pleasant and satisfying experience 
for many mothers. Although usually blissful, pregnancy 
is also a stressful period for many women, and some 
psychologists consider it as a period of emotional crisis.2 
Exposure to different life crises and stressful conditions 
can lead to anxiety; pregnancy is one of these stressful 
conditions. In pregnancy, there are many stressors for 
fetal health that make a person susceptible to mental 
disorders such as anxiety.3 Preeclampsia is one of 
these stressors and is an independent risk factor for 
the development of anxiety.4 A pregnancy-related 
disorder, preeclampsia may affect all organs in the 
body and is diagnosed in the presence of high blood 
pressure and excess protein in the urine (proteinuria) 
after 20 weeks of pregnancy. After diagnosis of this 
condition, immediate treatment and examination of 
the mothers, as well as prevention of its complications, 
such as maternal seizure, are of great importance.5 
Preeclampsia is associated with high maternal mortality 
and serious complications, as well as risk of perinatal 
death, premature birth, and intrauterine growth 
restriction. Even though many studies have investigated 
preeclampsia, its causative agents are still unknown.6 
Because of the long-term hospitalization required for 
diagnosis, treatment or follow-up of the patients, as 
well as the possible occurrence of unpredictable and 
uncontrollable events, such as preterm labor and fetal 
complications, this condition represents a major burden 
on pregnant women. In addition, unexpected medical 
interventions, and sometimes fear of death, also lead 
to anxiety and severe fear in mothers.7
Pregnant women with preeclampsia often present more 
health complaints compared to those with uncomplicated 
pregnancies, and they may suffer from both psychological 
and physical problems.8 Additionally, mean anxiety 
scores have been shown to be significantly increased in 
women with preeclampsia.5 In the study by Rigó et al., 
anxiety levels in pregnant women with preeclampsia were 
significantly higher than those in healthy pregnant women.9 
Cetin et al. reported that the frequency of symptoms of 
mental disorders in pregnant women with preeclampsia 
was higher than those found in the healthy women. In 
addition, the highest anxiety score and insomnia severity 
index were observed in women with severe preeclampsia. 
Also, they found out that preeclampsia had a negative 
effect on mental and emotional health and believed that 
obstetricians should recommend an appropriate mental 
health care to their patients with preeclampsia at the 
bedside and in the postpartum period.10
Pregnancy-related anxiety is of great importance 
because it causes various complications. Some 
researchers believe that severe anxiety during 
pregnancy may affect the relationship between the 
mother and the infant and reduce the mother’s ability 
to play her maternal roles, thus influencing the quality 
of the mother’s life.11,12
Anxiety is a psychopathological condition that 
even in the absence of clinical symptoms may have 
short- and long-term effects on pregnancy (mother 
and fetus). Common outcomes include preterm labor, 
low birth weight, lack of prenatal care, reduction in 
breastfeeding initiation, and postpartum depression 
and anxiety.13-18 Maternal stress in pregnancy has 
negative postpartum side effects and influences 
children’s physical and mental development. At age 
2, children of more anxious mothers showed lower 
mental health scores.19 Even though there is no direct 
relationship between the maternal and the fetal 
nervous systems, maternal emotional and mental 
states have significant effects on fetal responses and 
growth. In addition, distortion of the mother’s nervous 
system may disable the fetus to adapt to the maternal-
fetal environment.20,21
Providing mental health interventions for the 
pregnant woman is one of the social determinants of 
mental health and is of great importance: the mother 
is the first to give affection and love to the child, two 
essential components of security for the emotional 
development of children; in other words, maternal 
affection is the basis for the development of family 
emotional relationships. The emotional development of 
children depends on the quality of this affection, and its 
profound and permanent effects on the child’s mental 
health will be quite evident in adulthood. Therefore, 
maternal mental health is of great importance, and 
mothers are expected to be able to deal with problems 
and to take care of the baby.2
Taking care of women with risk factors for anxiety 
as well as counseling and referring them to more 
advanced diagnosis and treatments can improve 
their quality of life and reduce maternal and fetal 
outcomes and mortality. In this regard, midwives play 
a very important role as maternal mental-physical 
supporters. Midwives are responsible for relaxing 
mothers and reducing their anxiety during pregnancy. 
By knowing the warning signs of mental disorders, 
midwives contribute to a timely diagnosis and to the 
mothers’ referral to anxiety treatment programs.22
Considering the effects of anxiety on mother and 
fetus, especially in pregnant women with preeclampsia, 
this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of 
psycho-educational counseling on anxiety in pregnant

women with preeclampsia at two public hospitals in the 
municipality of Sirjan, Kerman. It is expected that the 
intervention will decrease anxiety levels in the sample 
and consequently improve pregnancy outcomes and 
the mothers’ quality of life.
Materials and methods
In this clinical trial, the effectiveness of psycho-
educational counseling on anxiety in pregnant women 
with preeclampsia admitted to two public hospitals of 
the municipality of Sirjan in 2016 was investigated. 
The research population was selected among pregnant 
women with preeclampsia admitted to the obstetrics 
and gynecology wards of Imam Reza and Dr. Gharazi 
hospitals, in Sirjan. The inclusion and eligibility criteria 
were as follows: pregnant woman with preeclampsia, 
gestational age ≥20 weeks, low risk pregnancy, ability 
to understand and speak Persian, and no history of drug 
use or smoking. Exclusion criteria were: incidence of 
pregnancy complications (bleeding, diabetes, preterm 
labor, etc.), occurrence of psychological trauma and/
or major stress during the intervention period, non-
attendance at training sessions, and history of specific 
mental illness.
Sample size was calculated according to Jokar & 
Rahmati, using the sample size formula. Considering 
a confidence interval of 95%, test power of 90%, 
accuracy of 2, and 15% probability of withdrawal, the 
sample size was estimated at a minimum of 22 patients 
in each group (total of 44 cases).23
This research is a parallel study with 1:1 allocation 
ratio involving 44 pregnant women with preeclampsia 
divided into two groups: control (n=22) and intervention 
(n=22). Random sampling was performed using block 
randomization in two stages. In the first stage, sampling 
was performed on odd days at the first hospital and on 
even days at the second hospital. In the second stage, 
the subjects were divided into the intervention and 
control groups. Data were collected using a questionnaire 
consisting of two parts, one covering demographic 
characteristics and the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety 
Inventory (STAI). Demographic characteristics included 
maternal age, education level, occupation, number of 
pregnancies, number of deliveries, abortion, age of 
pregnant woman, intended pregnancy and emotional 
relationships with husband.
The Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Questionnaire 
(STAI) was designed by Spielberg in 1970 and revised in 
1983. It includes 20 questions answered using a 4-point 
Likert scale ranging from 0 to 3 (0 = minimal, 1 = mild, 
2 = moderate, 3 = severe). Total scores may range 
from 20 to 80 and are classified as normal (0-19), mild 
anxiety (20-40), moderate anxiety (41-60) and severe 
anxiety (61-80).24,25 In 1993, Mahram standardized 
the questionnaire in Iran, with 0.91 reliability through 
Cronbach’s alpha formula.26 The reliability and validity of 
this questionnaire have been repeatedly measured.27
This study endorsed and followed the Consolidated 
Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement and 
checklist. The protocols of this study were approved by 
the ethics committee of the Kerman University of Medical 
Sciences (IR.KMU.REC.1395.556). This study has been 
registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT) 
with registration code IRCT2017082029817N3. After 
receiving a referral form from the Faculty of Nursing 
and Midwifery, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, 
the head of Imam Reza and Dr. Gharazi hospitals of 
Sirjan allowed the conduction of the study. Data were 
collected from January 30 2017 to March 31 2017 (2 
months). 
The objectives of the study were explained by 
the researcher to the participants, and those who 
signed the consent form were included. Before any 
procedure, including injection of magnesium sulfate, 
the mothers’ anxiety level was measured using the STAI 
questionnaire. Pregnant women with scores ranging 
from 20 to 60 were selected and divided into the control 
and intervention groups as described above, i.e., using 
block randomization. All the women who entered the 
study filled and signed informed consent forms.
The control group received the service’s routine care. 
The intervention group, in addition to receiving routine 
care, participated in two sessions of individual psycho-
educational counseling (lasting 45 minutes each) with a 
24-hour interval.28 The intervention was conducted by 
a certified master student of Counselling in Midwifery, 
under the supervision of a medical doctor who was 
assistant professor of Guidance and Counselling at 
the Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Midwifery 
Department. In the first session, pregnant women were 
informed about preeclampsia, its signs and symptoms, 
diagnosis and treatments, evaluation of the fetuses of 
mothers with preeclampsia and safety of assessments 
and procedures. The second session focused on teaching 
and practicing five anxiety self-management techniques 
in the context of their disease at an emergency hospital 
ward setting.
After the last session, the questionnaire was once 
again completed by both groups29 and the level of 
anxiety was measured. There were no drop-outs in this 
intervention. Data were analyzed using the Statistical 
Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22 
and were described using central indices, distribution, 
frequency and percentage. Demographic variables were

compared between the groups using the chi-square and 
independent t tests. Anxiety scores were compared 
between the groups using analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA). Because the difference between mean 
pretest scores obtained in the control and intervention 
groups was significant, posttest scores were compared 
using ANCOVA. Significance was set at p=0.05. The 
psycho-educational contents of the two sessions were 
approved by a psychiatry and included reassurance, 
problem-solving skills training, patient justification, 
relaxation training and positive emotions.30,31
Results
Table 1 shows the frequency distribution and 
percentages of demographic characteristics in the 
intervention and control groups: the two groups were 
similar in terms of demographic characteristics that 
may influence maternal anxiety during pregnancy, with 
no significant differences between the groups. 
Comparison of mean anxiety scores between the 
intervention and control groups before and after the 
intervention, as shown in Table 2, illustrates that

after holding counseling sessions, this difference was 
significant. There was no data normality in the pretest 
step. Therefore, Mann-Whitney’s test was applied to 
check the relationship between mean anxiety scores 
obtained in the two groups before the intervention. 
For the same reason, ANCOVA was used after the 
intervention to control for inconsistency of data 
normality between pretest and posttest results.
Comparison of pre- and posttest mean anxiety 
scores in the intervention and control groups (Table 3) 
shows that the psycho-educational intervention led to 
a significant reduction of anxiety. Conversely, in the 
control group, not only did anxiety not reduce, it slightly 
increased after the intervention.
Discussion
Preeclampsia, as an emergency event that affects 
1.2 to 27% of pregnancies, is an important stressor 
in nulliparous as well as multiparous women.40-42 
Contrariwise, 
anxiety 
can 
increase 
the 
risk 
of 
preeclampsia in pregnancy.43 The main purpose of 
this research was to determine the effects of psycho-
educational counseling on anxiety levels in pregnant 
women with preeclampsia. The findings showed that 
the mean anxiety scores in pregnant women with 
preeclampsia in the intervention group before and after 
the intervention were 51.36±5.52 and 46.09±8.44, 
respectively, indicating a reduction in anxiety levels 
in pregnant women with preeclampsia. The studies of 
Asghari et al. on 60 women32 and of Chao-Min on 120 
women with preeclampsia33 showed that cognitive-
behavioral therapy, health education and mental nursing 
could significantly reduce the level of anxiety. In the 
study by Bastani et al., relaxation training decreased 
the anxiety of pregnant women significantly,34 which is 
consistent with the present study. 
Anxiety side-effects in pregnant women suffering from 
preeclampsia are often caused by concerns about fetal 
health, hospitalization, and lack of sufficient knowledge 
about the therapeutic interventions performed on 
them in the ward that can threaten fetal life, as well as 
somatic symptoms related to their state anxiety.5,44-46 
The contents of psycho-educational counselling in this 
research were designed in such a way as to enhance 
the level of knowledge of pregnant women about the 
pathophysiology of their acute problem, to familiarize 
them with the therapeutic services offered, to reassure 
them about their own health and fetal health (provided 
the problem does not progress to eclampsia or becomes 
rarely complicated), to train problem-solving skills as 
well as anxiety management techniques, and patient’s 
appropriate justification to the problem. The above 
mentioned acquired abilities and positive attitudes 
may reduce the level of anxiety and promote maternal 
mental health during pregnancy.47 The study by Delaram 
& Soltanpour on the effectiveness of counseling in the

third trimester of pregnancy showed that counseling 
can reduce maternal anxiety.35
Regardless of the topics covered by psycho-
educational counseling, this type of intervention has 
shown successful influences on different types of 
anxiety disorders. Rummel-Kluge et al. found that this 
intervention was effective in 77% of the 622 patients 
with anxiety disorders, and therapeutic costs were 
significantly reduced.36 Conversely, it is interesting that 
prenatal and intrapartum methods used to decrease 
anxiety could reduce postpartum anxiety and cause a 
positive attitude towards childbirth.37,38 Not all studies, 
however, have found a reduction in postpartum 
depression.39 
Conclusion
It seems that psycho-educational counseling can be 
generalized and is applicable to other similar settings. 
This method has shown positive effects in reducing the 
level of anxiety as well as improving the mental health 
of pregnant women with preeclampsia.
