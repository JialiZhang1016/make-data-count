Abstract
1. Broad-scale land conversions and fertilizer use have dramatically altered the avail-
able staging area for herbivorous long-distance migrants. Instead of natural land, 
these birds rely increasingly on pastures for migratory fuelling and stopover, often 
conflicting with farming practices. To predict and manage birds’ future habitat 
use, the relative advantages and disadvantages of natural (e.g. saltmarsh, inter-
tidal) versus anthropogenic staging sites for foraging need to be understood.
2. We compared the migratory staging of brent geese on saltmarsh and pasture sites 
in spring. Food quality (nitrogen and fibre content), antagonistic behaviour, and 
body weight were quantified at nearby sites in simultaneous seasons. Individuals 
were tracked with high-resolution GPS and accelerometers to compare timing of 
migration and time budgets during fuelling.
3. On pastures, birds rested more and experienced higher ingestion rates, similar or 
superior food quality and reduced antagonistic interactions than on saltmarsh.
4. Brent geese using fertilized grasslands advanced their fuelling and migration 
schedules compared to those using saltmarsh. Pasture birds reached heavy 
weights earlier, departed sooner, and arrived in the Arctic earlier.
5. Intertidal mudflats were frequently visited by saltmarsh birds during the day, and 
available food there (algae, some seagrass) was of higher quality than terrestrial 
resources. Availability of intertidal resources was an important factor balancing 
the otherwise more favourable conditions on pastures relative to saltmarsh.
6.	 Synthesis and applications. Disadvantages of longer foraging effort, more antagonistic 
interactions and delayed fuelling schedules on traditional saltmarshes may cause 
geese to exchange this traditional niche in favour of pastures, especially in a warming 
climate that requires advancement of migratory schedules. However, due to its high 
quality, intertidal forage can complement terrestrial foraging, potentially removing 
the incentive for habitat switches to pastures. The relatively high quality of green 
algae and seagrass, and birds’ remarkable preference for these resources when avail-
able, provides a key for managers to create landscapes that can sustain this special-
ist’s intertidal lifestyle. To keep natural habitats attractive to staging geese with the

1 | INTRODUCTION
Human activity is altering our planet’s surface in rapid and pervasive 
ways. Over 80% of the earth’s land mass is now under direct human in-
fluence (Sanderson et al., 2002), with croplands and pastures occupying 
over 40% of the total area (Asner, Elmore, Olander, Martin, & Harris, 
2004; Foley, 2005). Migratory birds need to navigate these human-­
altered landscapes during their seasonal migration and depend on them 
as alternatives to lost natural habitat. Especially, agricultural land plays 
an important role in supporting migratory bird communities year-­round: 
pastures provide wintering and breeding grounds to meadow passer-
ines, waterfowl and waders (Knopf, 1994); rice fields (Elphick, 2015; 
Lourenço, Mandema, Hooijmeijer, Granadeiro, & Piersma, 2010) and salt 
pans (Masero, Pérez-­Hurtado, Castro, & Arroyo, 2000) act as important 
alternative stopover for shorebirds, and crane and goose populations 
make extensive use of waste crop in winter (Ma, Cai, Li, & Chen, 2010; 
Stafford, Kaminski, Reinecke, & Manley, 2006; Tourenq et al., 2001).
While agricultural intensification has led to precipitous declines 
of several farmland birds (Chamberlain, Fuller, Bunce, Duckworth, 
& Shrubb, 2000; Donald, Green, & Heath, 2001), geese are one of 
the few species groups that are successful in exploiting agricultural 
monocultures. By feeding on specially bred high-­energy cereal, root 
and grass crops, in combination with instated hunting bans and im-
proved protection of crucial stopover and wintering sites, popula-
tions of most goose species have recovered over the last 50 years 
(Abraham, Jefferies, & Alisauskas, 2005; Fox & Abraham, 2017; Fox 
et al., 2005). Their reliance on human landscapes is more apparent 
than ever, and conflicts between goose foraging and human farming 
practices continue to increase (Fox & Madsen, 2017). In addition to 
the effect of population growth per se, migratory geese cause in-
creasing crop damage because fertilizer application combined with 
warming springs has advanced crop phenology towards the migra-
tory staging periods. As a result, Arctic migrants are nowadays still 
present when the first spring cutting or harvest is due at temperate 
latitudes (Fox, Elmberg, Tombre, & Hessel, 2016).
Besides agricultural sources, natural areas remain important for 
geese, especially for species with a traditional coastal niche, like brent 
geese Branta bernicla. Brent geese breed on wet Arctic tundra, but forage 
on seagrass Zostera spp. and macroalgae Ulva spp. beds during the au-
tumn migration and winter. Along the East-­Pacific flyway, where these 
resources are most abundant, brent geese rely on seagrass and algae 
also during spring fuelling. Along the Atlantic flyways (both West and 
East), where seagrass abundance has seriously declined (Folmer et al., 
2016), populations also make use of alternative terrestrial resources 
during the course of winter and spring, such as saltmarsh, pastures 
and winter wheat (Inger et al., 2006; McKay, Langton, Milsom, & Feare, 
1996; Summers, 1990; Tubbs & Tubbs, 1982; Vickery, Sutherland, 
Watkinson, Lane, & Rowcliffe, 1995; Ward et al., 2005).
In this study, we focus on the population along the East-­Atlantic 
flyway, the dark-­bellied brent goose Branta b. bernicla. Previous stud-
ies showed that dark-­bellied brent geese (brent geese, hereafter), 
switched to feeding on saltmarsh in May, after feeding on pasture in 
March and April. Plant growth started later on the saltmarsh, and as 
a result, plant quality became as high (Eichhorn, Meijer, Oosterbeek, 
& Klaassen, 2012; Prins & Ydenberg, 1985) or, according to some, 
even higher on the saltmarsh in May (Boudewijn, 1984). Preference 
for the saltmarsh later in spring was further explained by the lack of 
disturbance, increasing foraging time and reducing energy expendi-
ture on the saltmarsh (Prins & Ydenberg, 1985; Riddington, Hassall, 
Lane, Turner, & Walters, 1996). Disturbance in the pasture habitat 
likely had an indirect effect as well: it prevented brent geese from 
concentrating on specific pasture parts, where they otherwise could 
keep the grass short and thereby maintain a high food quality (Bos, 
van de Koppel, & Weissing, 2004; Spaans & Postma, 2001).
From 2000 onwards, a new policy was implemented in the 
Netherlands that stopped deliberate scaring of brent geese in the 
majority of pasture habitat frequented by brent geese in early spring. 
This immediately led to more and extended visits of brent geese to 
the pasture habitat, while other individuals still fuelled on the salt-
marsh (Bos & Stahl, 2003). In this study, we aim to uncover which as-
pects of natural stopover sites, specifically natural saltmarsh, sustain 
the use of this habitat by migratory geese. We did this by comparing 
fuelling of brent geese on nearby saltmarsh and pasture staging sites. 
We simultaneously quantified, for both habitats, individual grazing 
time budgets, defecation rate and dropping weight (as proxies for 
ingestion rate, the rate at which biomass is grazed and swallowed), 
food quality, antagonistic behaviour, and their combined effect on 
body condition and timing of migration of brent geese. Based on the 
comparison, we identify management actions for keeping natural 
habitats attractive to brent geese.
2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 | Study sites
The study sites were located on two barrier islands of the Dutch 
Wadden Sea, the agricultural pastures of island Terschelling (53.38N, 
5.29E) and the early successional saltmarsh of Schiermonnikoog 
purpose of preventing conflicts with farming practices, management actions should 
focus on conservation and restoration of saltmarsh and especially intertidal habitat.

(53.49N, 6.30E). Plant sampling and behavioural observation pro-
grams were run in parallel at both sites from March 26 to June 7 
2013. The pasture site consists of 14 km2 contiguous agricultural 
grasslands stretched over a distance of 10 km. Fields are used mainly 
for dairy farming and livestock grazing but are managed as a goose 
and meadow bird refuge in spring. It is actively fertilized but free 
from scaring, disturbances or hunting, and mowing is postponed 
until early June. The back-­barrier marsh of Schiermonnikoog extends 
over a distance of 6 km. It is managed as a nature reserve and is 
closed to the public in spring. Along the south-­eastern 2–3 km, new 
marsh continues to form. The pristine young successional stages are 
intensively grazed by brent geese (Kuijper & Bakker, 2005), mak-
ing it an important natural staging site for this species. No livestock 
grazing occurs on the young stages of the marsh.
2.2 | Individual GPS tracking: Behavioural 
classification and time budget analysis
In spring 2012, brent geese were captured using canon netting both 
at the pasture site (53.37270N, 5.26922E) and at the saltmarsh site 
(53.4955N, 6.29229E). Individuals were colour-­ringed with unique 
codes, weighed within a few hours after capture, and sexed by cloa-
cal examination. In total, 30 adult male brent geese were tagged 
with UvA-­BiTS GPS trackers (Bouten, Baaij, Shamoun-­Baranes, & 
Camphuysen, 2013), which were attached as a backpack using nylon 
strings inserted in 4-­mm wide silicon tubing (Lameris et al., 2018). 
Twenty-­one individuals were tagged at the pasture site and nine at 
the saltmarsh site. Trackers were set to collect GPS fixes every hour 
down to every 5 min depending on available solar power. Following 
each GPS fix, we collected triaxial accelerometer data to quantify 
the birds’ foraging activity. In next spring (2013), six and four birds 
returned with working tags to fuel at the pasture and saltmarsh site, 
respectively, and no switches between the two habitat types were 
observed between years, nor within seasons (Fokkema et al., 2017). 
Because it may take some weeks for waterfowl to get accustomed 
to a tag (Kölzsch et al., 2016; Nuijten et al., 2014), we used this fol-
lowing spring for quantifying time budgets. Our birds frequently 
preened in the days after capture, but such behaviour was no longer 
observed next year.
As a measure of activity, we used the accelerometer’s vectorial 
sum of dynamic body acceleration α (Qasem et al., 2012), defined as 
the root of the sum of the three acceleration variances for each axis: 
α = √(σ2
x + σ2
y + σ2
z), where σx, σy, and σz are the SD of acceleration in 
the surge, sway and heave directions in units of g0, the earth’s stan-
dard gravity, and using a 20-­Hz signal over 7/20 s. The probability 
density histogram for α for birds located on the grasslands is shown 
in Figure S1. The peak at α = 0.015 g0 corresponds to cases where 
the bird is standing still, whereas the peak at α = 0.15 g0 corresponds 
to cases where the bird is actively foraging. We categorise a bird as 
inactive when α < 0.04 g0 or active when α > 0.04 g0. The threshold 
was found by decomposing the distribution into two gamma distri-
bution components, equalling the point where these two compo-
nents intersect at the same probability. Flying was detected using a 
threshold of α > 0.6 g0. Using 1 hr of video data on four black brent 
geese (Branta b. nigricans) GPS-­tagged in captivity, we verified that 
the threshold in α and sampling duration accurately distinguished 
inactivity from active behaviour (visually confirmed inactive resting 
α = 0.015 ± 0.01).
To determine whether birds were roosting on water, we used a 
bathymetric map of the Dutch Wadden Sea (cycle 5 map at 20 m 
resolution) and tidal water heights (every 10 min) provided by 
Rijkswaterstaat, Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management, 
the Netherlands. Mudflats were assumed to be flooded when the 
bathymetric height at the bird’s position was below the water height 
measured by the nearest tidal station (pasture, west-­Terschelling 
53.36305N 5.22003E; saltmarsh, Schiermonnikoog, 53.46894N 
6.20291E).
Combining accelerometer activity and location, we classified 
GPS fixes into 12 categories: fly, land active, mudflat active, on 
water, land rest, mudflat rest, each split out by day and night. For 
each individual, daily time budgets were calculated as the time spent 
in each category.
2.3 | Field observations: Faecal excretion and 
conspecific interaction rate
Antagonistic behaviour was quantified by scoring interactions be-
tween randomly picked focal individuals and other brent geese. 
Other goose species were uncommon at our study sites, and only 
intraspecific interactions were observed. We defined an interac-
tion as a direct confrontation between two birds, ranging from 
threats with lowered head and neck to active chases with flapping 
wings (cf. Stahl, Tolsma, Loonen, & Drent, 2001). Interactions were 
classified as wins, losses or draws (if no dominant bird in the inter-
action could be identified). For continuous observation bouts on 
individuals of at least 5 min (median 13 min), we calculated the in-
teraction rate as the numbers of combined wins, losses and draws 
divided by the bout length (Figure 2 bottom). We recorded 1,415 
interactions during 360 observation bouts of in total 121 hr on 
pastures, and 441 interactions during 102 bouts of in total 30 hr 
on saltmarsh.
To determine the seasonal trend in dropping rate (Figure 2), we 
timed 568 (pasture) versus 133 (saltmarsh) intervals between def-
ecation events of the same focal birds during interaction observa-
tions. Interval data were fitted to a probability density function that 
accounted for the nonzero chance that an observer failed to see 
a dropping be excreted (Dokter et al., 2017). Dropping and inter-
action observations were grouped into 2-­week periods according 
to the mid-­points between the dates of vegetation sampling (see 
below).
2.4 | Vegetation sampling and analysis
Grass and excreta were sampled in multiple transects (4 on salt-
marsh, 6 on pasture, 4–5 stations each) of increasing distance to the 
intertidal, such that fields exposed to different grazing intensities

and elevational gradients were included in the programme (see 
Fokkema et al., 2015) and (Dokter, Fokkema, Bekker, et al., 2018) for 
details on the sampling scheme). At each station, a 1-­m2 exclosure 
was put in place on March 13 2013, which was moved by several 
metres into a new position during visits every 2 weeks. Plant mate-
rial was collected from inside the exclosure on March 26 (pasture 
site only, as saltmarsh was still bare), April 10, April 21, May 8, and 
May 21. The pastures consisted of monocultures of Lolium, and only 
this single species was collected per station. On saltmarsh brent diet 
is more diverse, as has been well established in earlier studies at this 
site. On Schiermonnikoog brent geese forage mostly on Plantago 
maritima, Triglochin maritima, Puccinellia maritima, and Festuca rubra 
(Fokkema et al., 2015; Prop & Deerenberg, 1991), which was the 
potential saltmarsh diet considered for this study. During each field 
visit, we quantified grazing pressure per field (in droppings per m2) by 
counting droppings in five circles of 4 m2, which were cleared each 
visit and of which the centres were marked by inconspicuous 5 cm 
protruding sticks. From each circle, two droppings were collected 
as fresh as possible. Intertidal forage was sampled on mudflats at 
Uithuizerwad (53.47N 6.75E) on June 18, one of the few areas in 
the Dutch Wadden Sea where seagrass Zostera noltii still occurs, and 
where brent geese frequently forage (van der Heide et al., 2012). Sea 
lettuce Ulva lactuca was also sampled here. Plant and dropping ma-
terial was oven-­dried at 60°C for 24 hr directly after collection, and 
ground through a 1 mm sieve, after weighing droppings individually.
A random selection stratified by period yielded 25 pasture and 
60 saltmarsh samples which were chemically analysed for acid de-
tergent fibre (ADF) (Van Soest, Robertson, & Lewis, 1991). The 
chemical ADF analyses were used as a calibration dataset for esti-
mating ADF concentrations of the full dataset (135 plant samples 
pasture, 116 samples saltmarsh) by near-­infrared reflectance spec-
troscopy on a Bruker MPA FT-­NIR analyser using the OPUS 7.0 soft-
ware package (Foley et al., 1998). All samples were analysed for total 
nitrogen using a Thermo Scientific FLASH 2000 elemental analyser. 
ADF and nitrogen content are expressed as mass percentages on 
ash-­free dry mass basis. Period averages of these quantities were 
calculated as an average over stations weighted by the grazing pres-
sure of each field in that period. This weighting guaranteed that ADF 
and nitrogen values represented the fields that were used for forag-
ing by the geese, and not the unused fields.
2.5 | Statistics
Temporal trends and differences between sites in time budgets 
were analysed using a linear mixed model for each time budget cat-
egory (Table 1), using the lme function of r-­package nlme (Pinheiro, 
Bates, DebRoy, & Sarkar, 2017). We considered date (unit: days since 
January 1 2013), site and their interaction as fixed effects, and in-
dividual as random effect (random date slope and intercept), as in 
activity ~ date + site + date:site + (date|ID). The most parsimonious 
model was selected using the Akaike information criterion for mod-
els fitted by log-­likelihood maximization (ML). Site effects (terms site 
and date:site) were retained only if including these terms significantly 
improved the model according to a likelihood ratio test against a null 
model without these terms. We applied a Bonferroni correction to 
these likelihood ratio tests to correct for multiple comparisons, by 
multiplying p-­values by the number of categories considered (12). 
Parameter estimates were obtained from a fit by restricted likeli-
hood maximization (REML).
Dropping weights, interaction rates, and plant quality measures 
were compared using Mann–Whitney U tests. Since plant quality 
was measured for different plant species, we adjusted p-­values by 
a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons between species 
within each month. To test for body weight differences between 
sites, we first accounted for the 5–6 day difference in catching date, 
by applying a correction of +60 g to the saltmarsh bird weights, as-
suming a 10 g/day weight gain (Ebbinge & Spaans, 1995). Each sex 
was tested separately. We calculated the principal components 
of the structural size measurements wing length and head length 
against body weight. We then tested for a significant effect of site in 
a linear model for body weight, including the first principal compo-
nent (PC1) as a predictor to correct for structural body size.
3 | RESULTS
Individual high-­resolution time budgets show that brent geese stag-
ing on saltmarsh spent more time actively foraging than birds on 
pasture (Figure 1, green active, red idle), on average 2.3 and 1.7 hr 
more in April and May, respectively, cf. Table 1. This table shows 
mean time budgets for April and May averaged over individuals, and 
a temporal trend analysis (with trends differing between habitats in-
dicated in bold). Pasture birds were frequently idle for short periods, 
indicating they were resting or taking digestion pauses; this idling in-
creased over the season (Table 1). Interestingly, saltmarsh birds com-
plemented foraging on land with additional daytime foraging trips to 
the intertidal during low tide (Figure 1) and spent overall more active 
time in the intertidal zone, especially during the day (Table 1). Such 
daytime intertidal foraging trips were not observed for pasture birds. 
Pasture birds spent more time flying than saltmarsh birds, but daily 
flight time decreased to below half an hour over the season in both 
habitats (Table 1).
Both the weight of individual faecal droppings, and the rate at 
which droppings were excreted, were lower on saltmarsh than on 
pasture (Figure 2 top). The rate of excretion of undigested plant 
material was therefore lower at the saltmarsh. Saltmarsh was also a 
more antagonistic environment than pasture, as shown by a higher 
frequency of aggressive interactions in April (Figure 2 bottom).
Food quality was assessed by the food’s nitrogen content and ADF 
content (afdm basis), which are proxies for protein content and fibre 
content respectively. Food quality was assumed to increase with pro-
tein content and decrease with fibre content (Prop & Vulink, 1992). 
Food quality values are shown in Figure 3, with mean and SD values 
given in Table S1. The quality measures of pasture grass were compared 
in a pair-­wise fashion to each of the available food resources sampled 
on the saltmarsh and intertidal (Figure 3, pairs significantly different

indicated by connecting brackets). The quality proxies for terrestrial 
plants in the diet of geese on saltmarsh never exceeded the values 
measured for fertilized grasses on pasture (Figure 3) in the 2 months 
considered (April and May). In later spring (May), only the rarer food 
items (Plantago, Triglochin) maintained comparable quality levels to 
pasture grasslands, while the more common food items (Festuca, 
Puccinellia) were of lower quality relative to fertilized grass (cf. Table 
S1. Festuca: N 0.7 ± 0.3% lower, ADF 4.2 ± 1.0% higher; Puccinellia: 
N 1.2 ± 0.2% lower, ADF 5.8 ± 1.4% higher). Interestingly, intertidal 
forage (Zostera, Ulva) were the only resources with a higher quality 
measures than terrestrial pasture grass (Zostera: ADF 7.1 ± 0.2% lower, 
N 0.1 ± 0.7% higher; Ulva: ADF 11 ± 1% lower). For Ulva, no N content 
was determined in this study, but high protein content has been re-
ported for Ulva in other studies (e.g. Ortiz et al., 2006).
Catches on saltmarsh and pasture showed that by mid-­May pasture 
birds were in higher body condition than saltmarsh birds (Figure 4). 
This advanced fuelling schedule also translated in earlier departures 
from pastures than saltmarshes in both years that we tracked individ-
uals (Figure 5). Pasture birds remained ahead of saltmarsh birds during 
migration up to 3,500 km from the spring staging sites.
4 | DISCUSSION
Nearly all foraging parameters in our comparative analysis pointed 
towards more favourable fuelling conditions on pastures than on 
saltmarsh. We found that birds foraging on saltmarsh spent a sub-
stantially longer active foraging time per day compared to birds for-
aging on pasture. A high food biomass availability, combined with a 
high quality, led to limited aggressive interactions on pastures, and 
these factors together likely translated into a superior ingestion 
rate. These ingestion rates were probably high enough for birds to 
approach their digestive bottleneck, explaining the frequent short 
resting periods most likely used for digestion. Such idling periods 
were much less common on saltmarsh, suggesting that saltmarsh 
birds were more ingestion-­limited than digestion-­limited. Birds

needed more time to collect their food, likely because high-­quality 
resources are more patchily distributed on a saltmarsh. This time 
pressure also explains why they were more involved in antagonistic 
interactions than the geese foraging on pasture (Van Gils & Piersma, 
2004). Saltmarsh vegetation is highly heterogeneous and brent 
geese can fight over patches rich in preferred plant species (Prop 
& Deerenberg, 1991), whereas pasture vegetation is very homoge-
neous. Easy access to high quality food on pastures likely allowed 
for earlier and faster fuelling rates, which explains the earlier weight 
gain and earlier migration of geese foraging on pastures.
Our results explain why nowadays many brent geese prepare 
for migration on pastures. While in the past frequent disturbance 
in pastures might have caused saltmarsh to be the preferred habitat 
(Prins & Ydenberg, 1985; Riddington et al., 1996), nowadays, with a 
lower disturbance regime in the pasture habitat and given our re-
sults, it may seem surprising that birds still return to saltmarsh. We 
cannot exclude the possibility that birds currently fuelling on salt-
marsh mostly follow tradition, which is common for geese (Fox et al., 
2005; Kanarek, Lamberson, & Black, 2008), and that birds return to 
the same historical stopover site even though conditions elsewhere 
may have become better. The alternative explanation that brent 
geese are pushed out of agricultural pastures to saltmarshes is con-
sidered unlikely, since pastures are abundantly available, such that 
density dependence is probably not playing a role in habitat choice 
(Fox et al., 2005). Also, no support was found for the hypothesis that 
saltmarsh vegetation provides nutrients or essential amino acids that 
cannot be obtained on pastureland (Eichhorn et al., 2012). Geese 
thus seem largely released from limitations by nutrients (Dokter, 
Fokkema, Bekker, et al., 2018; Fox & Abraham, 2017), at least in 
relatively mild temperate winter weather. An alternative reason 
that brent geese persist on saltmarsh may be that the pay-­offs are 
eventually the same. Although we had indications of better fuelling 
conditions on pasture, a previous comparison of brent geese pre-
paring for migration in pasture and saltmarsh habitat did not reveal 
any differences in reproductive success (Spaans & Postma, 2001). 
Such a difference might be expected since brent geese are capital 
breeders (Spaans’t Hoff, van Veer, & Ebbinge, 2007), in which body

stores upon departure from the spring staging site partly determine 
reproductive success (Ebbinge, 1989).
Saltmarsh birds showed a delayed fuelling and departure relative 
to pasture birds. The advanced fuelling schedule of pasture birds 
allowed them to depart several days earlier, though this difference 
should be interpreted with care given the small sample size and 
overlap between the groups. Nonetheless, the difference in depar-
ture date may be important, because early arrival on the breeding 
grounds has been shown to be a critical fitness proxy in geese, re-
lated to improved breeding success (Prop, Black, & Shimmings, 2003). 
Eventually, close to the breeding grounds, the saltmarsh birds caught 
up timewise with the pasture birds, perhaps limiting any negative 
effects on reproductive success. However, in years with early snow 
melt in the Arctic, a scenario that is predicted to become more com-
mon (AMAP, 2017), earlier migration of pasture birds may represent 
a relative fitness benefit. Under an advancing spring, pastures cur-
rently provide more leeway for further advancement of migratory 
schedules than saltmarshes, since plenty of high quality food is avail-
able on pastures even before the current start of migratory fuelling, 
when saltmarshes are still largely barren. It is therefore conceivable 
that the favourable pasture conditions during the entire spring sea-
son will draw in an increasing portion of the population in the future, 
leading to more conflicts between farming practices and geese.
Brent geese using the saltmarsh frequently foraged in the inter-
tidal during low tide during the day. Intertidal forage has the poten-
tial to offset the otherwise more preferential conditions of pastures, 
because of its superior quality as a food resource, and potentially 
because of lower foraging costs. Intertidal food (algae, seagrass) had 
the highest overall quality, both in terms of a high nitrogen content 
and low fibre content. This high quality of intertidal plants is poten-
tially induced by saline stressors to the plant (Fokkema et al., 2015), 
and because floating macroalgae and seagrass require less support-
ive tissue compared to terrestrial plants (Cyr & Pace, 1993). Intertidal 
food is more accessible to brent geese than to other herbivores be-
cause of their high salt tolerance (Stahl, Bos, & Loonen, 2002). Our 
tracking data also show a strong selection of intertidal habitats by 
brent in autumn and winter (both pasture and saltmarsh birds), with 
79% of individuals overwintering in the intertidal of France and the 
UK (Fokkema et al., 2017).
The eastern Dutch Wadden Sea, in contrast to the western part, 
has seen slow recoveries of intertidal communities, including sea-
grasses (Dolch, Buschbaum, & Reise, 2013; Folmer et al., 2016), mus-
sel beds, and general benthos hotspots (Compton et al., 2013). This 
spatial difference may explain why birds maintained a substantial 
intertidal lifestyle on the more eastern island of Schiermonnikoog, 
while at the pasture site of the more western island of Terschelling 
there was no clear evidence of foraging in the intertidal.
The saltmarsh on the island of Terschelling used to be a preferred 
area (Ebbinge, 1992), but is nowadays hardly being used anymore by 
brent geese. An additional explanation for the increased use of pas-
tures may be that this saltmarsh has become older with taller vegeta-
tion. A saltmarsh is constantly subject to erosion and succession (Olff, 
De Leeuw, Bakker, Platerink, & Van Wijnen, 1997). Brent geese prefer 
the youngest parts of the saltmarsh, and can be evicted by ongoing suc-
cession (van der Wal, Lieshout, Bos, & Drent, 2000). Grazing by larger 
herbivores like hares and live stock keeps the saltmarsh in a younger 
state, and helps to keep it favourable for brent geese (Bos et al., 2005; 
van der Wal, van Wijnen, van Wieren, Beucher, & Bos, 2000).
We note that our sample size of tracked individuals was fairly 
small, which risks time budgets being biased by specifics of individ-
uals. Time budgets and activity patterns are, however, very different 
for individuals on different habitats (Figure 1 top, middle), with little 
individual overlap between the two groups in the second half of the 
fuelling period (Figure 1 bottom). This suggests individual differences 
within sites are relatively small compared to between-­site differences.
We further note that observational studies on free-­living animals 
cannot explicitly address the causality in a chain of events. However, 
the alternative of experimentally manipulating each step is likely un-
feasible and disruptive of the natural fuelling trajectories (Legagneux, 
Fast, Gauthier, & Bety, 2012), which we wanted to be representative for

the two habitat types as much as possible. The pasture management 
on Terschelling is comparable to dairy farming practices elsewhere in 
the Netherlands and north-­western Europe (Thomassen, van Calker, 
Smits, Iepema, & de Boer, 2008), characterized by frequent applica-
tion of manure and fertilizer. The marsh on Schiermonnikoog still ac-
tively expands to the east, and the successional gradient to very young 
stages makes it one of the most pristine saltmarshes of the Wadden 
Sea (Bos et al., 2005). Our pasture site can thus be considered fairly 
representative of farming practices elsewhere, while the saltmarsh is 
likely one of the higher quality marshes available to brent geese.
4.1 | Conservation and management implications
Based on historical hunting bags, brent geese population sizes are 
currently a fraction of the past (Ebbinge, 2014). 1930s wasting dis-
ease and subsequent eutrophication decimated seagrass popula-
tions in the northern hemisphere (Folmer et al., 2016; Godet et al., 
2008). More locally, land reclamation works in the Netherlands de-
teriorated the growing conditions for intertidal food plants of brent 
geese (Eriksson et al., 2010). Brent geese remain a species of global 
concern subject to a multitude of risks: further intertidal habitat 
losses (Clausen & Clausen, 2014), degradation, succession, and eu-
trophication of remaining saltmarsh habitat (Ebbinge, 2014; van der 
Wal, Lieshout, et al., 2000; van der Wal, van Wijnen, et al., 2000), as 
well as climate-­induced changes at the breeding sites, such as falter-
ing lemming cycles (Nolet et al., 2013).
In this context, agricultural land has become an indispensable 
stopover habitat, and is likely to remain so in the foreseeable future. 
Birds depend here on policies and financial incentives for farmers, who 
allow birds to graze their land repeatedly. Such repeated grazing is es-
sential for birds to keep grass in a young (short-­sward) vegetative state 
(Bos et al., 2004). Financial incentives to farmers to let geese graze 
freely have brought disturbances at both our saltmarsh and pasture 
site to historically low levels, which is reflected in little time spent 
flying (down to 0.37 hr/day or less). This is considerably less than at 
an agricultural and saltmarsh sites in Denmark and the UK (Clausen, 
Clausen, Fox, Fælled, & Madsen, 2012; Riddington et al., 1996) (cf. 
factor 4 in Denmark), where disturbance-­induced flying was identified 
as an important factor explaining habitat use. Ongoing losses of eel-
grass and young saltmarsh habitat (Deegan et al., 2012; Ganter, 2000) 
make it unlikely that natural habitat alone can support current geese 
populations (Ebbinge, 1992). Without alternative natural habitat, brent 
currently remain dependent on low-­disturbance pasture land, which 
however could be easily lost if farmers would resume active scaring 
should financial compensation cease (Bos & Stahl, 2003).
These historical and conservation contexts add weight to our 
current insight that sufficient availability of young saltmarsh and in-
tertidal resources may be the most effective way for managers by 
which they can prevent brent geese from switching to agricultural 
pasture even further. Our comparative analysis suggests that geese 
on natural land may be living near a limit at which they reach a com-
petitive disadvantage to birds fuelling on pasture sites. It is therefore 
critical that remaining saltmarsh habitat is not degraded any further. 
Our study at a pristine saltmarsh suggests that saltmarsh manage-
ment alone may be insufficient to prevent further habitat switching 
to pastures. Expanding the availability of nearby intertidal resources 
at saltmarshes is likely one of the most effective ways for keeping 
natural habitat attractive, because its food quality remains superior 
to terrestrial resources. The challenge for land managers is to create 
saltmarsh and intertidal conditions that allow brent geese to stick to 
their traditional niche, and thereby reduce the species’ reliance on 
costly compensation schemes to farmers.
