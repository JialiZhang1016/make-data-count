Mountain areas provide disproportionally high runoff in many parts of the world, but their importance 
for lowland water resources and food production has not been clarified so far. Here we quantify for the 
first time the extent to which lowland inhabitants potentially depend on runoff contributions from 
mountain areas (39% of land mass). We show that ~1.4 billion people (23% of world’s lowland 
population) are projected to depend critically on runoff contributions from mountains by mid-21st century 
under a ‘middle of the road’ scenario, compared to ~0.2 B (8%) in the 1960s. This striking rise is mainly 
due to increased local water consumption in the lowlands, whereas changes in mountain and lowland 
runoff play a minor role only. We furthermore show that one third of global lowland area equipped for 
irrigation is currently located in regions that both depend heavily on runoff contributions from mountains 
and make unsustainable use of local blue water resources, a figure that is likely to rise to well over 50% in 
the coming decades. Our findings imply that mountain areas should receive particular attention in water 
resources management and underscore the protection they deserve in efforts towards sustainable 
development. 
Water is a key resource for the 21st century: Mainly due to population growth and associated food production, 
global water consumption has increased almost four-fold over the past 100 years1 and water demand is 
approaching the total renewable freshwater available today2. The importance of water for environmental, 
economic and social aspects places it at the heart of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)3. Mountain 
areas, in turn, play an important role in water resources in that they often deliver disproportionally high runoff to 
the subjacent lowlands that is crucial for irrigation, industry, drinking, domestic use, hydropower and 
ecosystems4–7. In this context of superior runoff contributions, “mountain area” and “mountains” are used here in 
a broad definition that also includes hills and elevated plateaux4,5 (Methods). 
Because of their importance in water resources, the contributions of mountain areas need to be understood much 
better yet. In particular, demographic, socio-economic and environmental changes affecting mountain water 
resources must be viewed in the larger picture of global development planning and policy making8. The large 
lead times required for implementing adaptation measures, such as reservoirs and water transfer systems, 
emphasise the urgency of a solid basis for long-term management of water resources originating in mountain 
areas9. Moreover, sharpening the picture of increasing pressure imposed on mountain areas through rapidly 
growing water demand both in mountains and lowlands is a key ingredient to sustainable mountain 
development10.

The importance of mountain areas in providing freshwater for a significant portion of the world population has 
been recognised in its principle for a long time4,11, and a global typology of mountain areas in water resources 
revealed that almost half of these areas world-wide provide supportive or even essential water resources for the 
areas downstream5. In studies focused on individual regions, Asia has received particular attention due to the 
vast population of well over a billion that live in the river basins originating in High Mountain Asia12,13. 
Still lacking to date is a global overview that addresses and differentiates the potential dependence of lowland 
populations on mountain runoff, is meaningful at the regional scale, and assesses changes over time, including 
anticipated future changes14,15. In an attempt to fill this gap, we here present the first comprehensive mapping 
and quantification of lowland inhabitants depending on mountain water resources, and a subsequent analysis of 
the importance of mountain runoff contributions for food production. We achieve a resolution of 5’ (arc minutes, 
~9 km at the Equator) and can thus also examine smaller highland-lowland systems that would be clustered in 
the currently still common resolution of 30’. This improved resolution is also important for water resources 
management at the level of individual regions, as well as setting priorities in future research, especially for 
regions that do not dispose of detailed models and studies15. In the temporal dimension, we cover the time from 
1961 to the present and consider three possible developments for runoff and consumptive water use until 2050. 
We explore a “middle of the road” scenario (SSP2-RCP6.0 pathway), a “green road” scenario (sustainability, 
accelerated demographic transition; SSP1-RCP4.5), and a “rocky road” scenario (regional rivalry, high 
population growth in developing countries; SSP3-RCP6.0). While the extension into the future is crucial for a 
more comprehensive planning of water resources under climate and global change, the look back allows for a 
quantification of changes in the Anthropocene era16. 
Dependence of lowland inhabitants on mountain water resources 
Our assessment is based on a high-resolution and state-of-the-art Global Hydrological Model (GHM) that 
simulates both runoff as well as consumptive water use and includes reservoir regulation17,18. The model has 
already been applied to numerous projects that quantified global water resources and climate change impacts17. 
Based on relief roughness and elevation, the global land surface area (not including Greenland and Antarctica) is 
then divided into a mountain (39% of total) and a lowland (61%) part (Methods; Supplementary Fig. S1). The 
mountain part encompasses mountainous areas in the strict sense as well as plateaux and rugged hills of at least 
medium elevation. This is important because all of these areas can have an important role in providing runoff to 
the lowlands5. The extent of this importance largely depends on the combination of climatic conditions found in 
the mountain and lowland portions of a catchment5,19. Lowlands encompass the remaining land surface area. 
We identify the potential dependence of lowland areas on mountain water resources by computing a water 
balance for each lowland raster cell, with local runoff on the credit side, and local consumptive water use and 
ecological flow requirements on the debit side. The resulting surplus or deficit of each lowland raster cell is then 
compared with a similar balance that represents average conditions in the related mountain area. ‘Related’ here 
means that this comparison always takes place in a river catchment, and thus follows the hydrological link 
between mountain and lowland areas (Fig. 1a). With the result of this balance, the dependence of each lowland 
raster cell on mountain runoff is determined, differentiating the potential contribution from mountains into 
essential, supportive, minor and negligible (Fig. 1b). Lowland areas depending on essential mountain surpluses 
are further analysed by assessing how large the mountain surplus is as compared to the lowland deficit. This 
allows for differentiating lowland regions where mountain surpluses are insufficient or even vastly insufficient 
for balancing out water deficits, and sensitivity towards variations and changes in the contribution from 
mountains is large. On this basis, we can then quantify the number of lowland people potentially depending on 
mountain runoff. A key benefit of this analysis is that we take into account local climatic conditions and water 
consumption patterns in the lowlands and thus can assess what portion of lowland population depends critically 
on mountain surpluses and where it is located. This issue was e.g. touched upon (but not elaborated in more 
detail) for the rivers that originate in High Mountain Asia20. A similarly differentiated picture will be painted for 
the dependence of lowland food production on mountain runoff. 
Changes in the global picture from past over present to future 
Results for the entire globe (excluding Greenland and Antarctica) in a decadal timeline from 1961 to 2050 reveal 
notable changes (Fig. 2a): The lowland population depending on essential mountain runoff contributions grows 
from ~0.6 B (23% of total lowland population) in the 1960s to ~1.8 B (38%) in the 2000s and ~2.5 B (39%) in 
the 2040s under the SSP2-RCP6.0 scenario (SSP1-RCP4.5: ~2.3 B / 38%; SSP3-RCP6.0: ~2.7 B / 40%). In 
relative terms, the major part of this growth took place in 1961–2010 already (Supplementary Fig. S2a), while 
dependence on contributions from mountains becomes increasingly critical, with ~0.2 B (8%) of population 
 
3 
benefiting from essential but insufficient contributions in the 1960s, ~0.8 B (17%) in the 2000s, and a projected 
~1.4 B (23%) in the 2040s under SSP2-RCP6.0 (SSP1-RCP4.5: ~1.2 B / 21%; SSP3-RCP6.0: ~1.5 B / 23%). A 
complete lack of runoff surplus from mountain areas is found in various regions, caused by low runoff (e.g., 
parts of the Rocky Mountains and South Africa), high water consumption (e.g., parts of China and India), or 
both (e.g., parts of the Yellow River catchment) (Supplementary Fig. S3a, c, e). In the lowlands, such a lack is 
especially grave if a deficit prevails there (Supplementary Fig. S3b, d, f). In this case, the lowlands must be 
expected to resort to other options21, including dams, desalination, water recycling, use of fossil groundwater and 
interbasin transfers (such as in California and China)22. Our analysis suggests that a number of catchments have 
already moved into this situation in the past decades or will do so until mid-21st century (e.g., on the Indian 
Peninsula23) (Supplementary Fig. S4, Supplementary Tables S1, S2). 
These figures, however, only paint part of the picture since the dependence of lowland inhabitants on mountain 
runoff strongly depends on the climate zone in focus, and global averages thus tend to underrate this dependence 
in individual regions. Especially in dryer climate zones, mountains provide important runoff that is distributed 
downstream via the river systems19. In these cases, mountains are elevated humid islands within an arid region 
and thus match the original concept of “water towers”5. Therefore, we further analyse our results by hydrobelts, 
i.e. hydrological basins aggregated to regions with similar hydroclimatic characteristics24 (Methods) (Figs. 2b–i, 
Supplementary Figs. S2b–i). The most notable changes are found in the North mid-latitude hydrobelt, where the 
lowland population depending on essential mountain contributions increases by almost a billion from ~0.4 B 
(26% of this hydrobelt’s lowland population; 16% of world total lowland population) to ~1.4 B (45%; 22%) in 
the same time (Fig. 2c). Further notable increases are found in the North dry, North subtropical, Boreal and 
Equator hydrobelts (Fig. 2d, e, b, f). 
Hot spot regions 
The global picture shows a number of ‘hot spot’ regions where the dependence of lowlands on mountain runoff 
was high already in the past, is today or is projected to become so in the future (Fig. 3a–c, Box 1). South and 
East Asia are of particular relevance, especially the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna catchment that hosts the 
largest number of lowland people depending on essential mountain contributions, namely 94 M in 1961–1970, 
391 M in 2001–2010 and 570 M in 2041–2050 under SSP2-RCP6.0 (Table 1). It is worth noting that this six-
fold increase (+476 M) also represents the major part of population growth in this catchment from 1961 to 2050 
(+639 M). Another vast growth of lowland population depending on mountain contributions is found in the 
Yangtze River catchment, with a 2.6 fold increase from 114 M (1961–1970) over 263 M (2001–2010) to 293 M 
(2041–2050, SSP2-RCP6.0). Significant growth in lowland population (increase of more than 25 M from 1961–
1970 to 2041–2050) in areas with essential mountain contributions is further found in the Nile and Niger River 
catchments, and it takes place even almost exclusively in these areas in the Amur, Kaveri, Euphrates-Tigris, 
Godavari, Indus, Pearl, and Volga River basins. At the level of countries, India shows the biggest increase in 
lowland population depending on essential mountain contributions (+646 M from 1961–1970 to 2041–2050, 
SSP2-RCP6.0), followed by China (+244 M), Pakistan (+152 M) and Egypt (+86 M) (Supplementary Table S3). 
In addition, many catchments have a notable lowland population that benefits from supportive runoff from 
mountain areas (Supplementary Table S4). 
Main drivers for change 
An important question for water resources management is whether the developments found here are driven by 
changes in runoff or by changes in water consumption25. Since we are interested in a comparison of lowland and 
mountain water balance, it is imperative to examine the relation of mountain runoff to lowland runoff over time. 
However, no fundamental changes in pattern are found in this relation (Supplementary Fig. S6), although it 
changes in favour mountain runoff in some regions (e.g., Himalayas, parts of the Andes) and in favour of 
lowland runoff in others (e.g., Central and Southern Rocky Mountains, South-West Africa, Atlas Mountains). 
Moderate changes are also visible in a breakdown to individual hydrobelts (Supplementary Fig. S7b–i), but do 
not prevail in the global summary (Supplementary Fig. S7a). 
We achieve a deeper insight into the drivers by looking at the number of people projected to reside in a specific 
dependence category 2041–2050, and comparing that to results from a baseline scenario with runoff and total 
water consumption unchanged at 1961–1970 values. There are then four potentially relevant drivers: mountain 
runoff, mountain water consumption, lowland runoff, and lowland water consumption. Varying one of these at a 
time shows that the 2.5-fold increase in lowland water consumption between 1961 and 2050 (SSP2-RCP6.0) is 
by far the most important factor shifting people towards higher dependency on mountain runoff (Table 2). At 
global scale, per capita lowland water consumption does not exhibit major changes from 1961 to 2050 under all 
 
4 
scenarios considered, although there are regions with clear increase (e.g. Boreal and North mid-latitude 
hydrobelts) and decrease (e.g., North dry and Equator hydrobelts). Overall, lowland population development is 
therefore the most important factor in determining the dependence of lowlands on mountain runoff 
(Supplementary Fig. S8), whereas changes in mountain population, mountain runoff and lowland runoff are of 
minor importance. 
Potential impacts on food production 
Roughly, three quarters of global food production (caloric value) originate in lowlands today, and lowlands host 
about the same share of global area equipped for irrigation (AEI) (Supplementary Tables S5, S6). Mountain 
areas, despite their small share in food production, can contribute important runoff to lowland irrigated 
agriculture26 (Fig. 4): Of the AEI present in lowlands 2001–2010, 68% (or 1.54·106 km2) were located in regions 
that depend on essential runoff contributions from the mountains. Half of that (0.77·106 km2) show low 
sustainability of local blue water use (liquid water in rivers, lakes, and aquifers27) in addition, thus amplifying 
the dependence on contributions from mountain areas. 
Under runoff and water consumption conditions projected for 2041–2050 (SSP2-RCP6.0), as much as 56% of 
lowland AEI (1.28·106 km2) would be located in regions both depending on mountain runoff and making 
unsustainable use of local blue water resources. This expansion is mainly occurring in regions that did already 
depend on mountain water resources 2001–2010, while the area making unsustainable use of blue water 
resources also increases. The North dry hydrobelt, already under critical conditions to a large extent in the 1960s 
and 2000s, shows a particularly alarming development in this direction, with 86% of lowland AEI projected to 
be under unsustainable conditions and depending on mountain areas. An important rise in this combination of 
critical conditions is also apparent in the North subtropical hydrobelt. Overall, these numbers imply that 
mountain areas could become even more important to support food production in the future, especially in regions 
like India, Egypt, and Southern Africa (Supplementary Fig. S9). 
Implications for global water resources 
Our new findings provide a guide to regions where more profound knowledge is necessary regarding the 
dependence of lowlands on mountain runoff, and the impacts of population dynamics and climatic changes 
should be studied in more detail. For facilitating water resources management, it will be imperative to also 
consider the seasonality of both lowland water consumption and mountain water provisions, especially with a 
view to changes in the important contribution of snowmelt and, in some regions, also ice melt28–32. Bearing in 
mind the sensitivity of mountain environments, the amplification of warming with elevation and the non-linear 
reaction of the cryosphere to climate forcing33–36, these changes in seasonality may also reveal a more distinct 
impact of climate change and qualify the dominant control of lowland water consumption found in this study, 
especially in wet-dry climates of the subtropics. 
We show that lowland water resources have become increasingly dependent on mountain areas in the past 
decades and are likely to become even more so in the future: Water scarcity is projected to be more severe, and 
ongoing groundwater depletion may pose a serious water security risk in intense agricultural regions2,12. This 
might cause higher vulnerability under an uncertain climate36, as highlighted by our finding that well over half of 
lowland areas equipped for irrigation might depend both on mountain water surpluses and unsustainable lowland 
water resources by mid-21st century under a ‘middle of the road‘ scenario. At the same time, population and land 
use pressure are expected to increase further36,37, leading to considerable challenges to environmental 
sustainability38. In addition, large-scale human interventions like land use and land cover changes, construction 
of dams and reservoirs as well as withdrawals from surface water and groundwater negatively affect the 
downstream parts of river catchments and may lead to additional imbalances between mountain and lowland 
areas39. All of this underscores the special protection and attention mountain areas deserve in efforts towards 
sustainable development, and suggests that highland-lowland interactions should not be a one-way process in 
favour of the lowlands, but that compensation mechanisms in the reverse direction should be considered to 
support sustainable development both in mountain and lowland areas26. In summary, our work emphasises that 
hydrosolidarity40 between mountain and lowland populations sharing a common river basin is essential, with the 
goal of an ethically sound orchestration of land, water and ecosystem related activities.

Box 1. Potential dependence of lowlands on mountain water resources in selected river basins. 
In the Indus River basin, lowland population is projected to increase close to fivefold from 44 M in the 1960s 
to 210 M in the 2040s (SSP2). Even though per-capita lowland water consumption decreases by almost two 
thirds, nearly all lowland inhabitants (93–95%) depend on mountain runoff throughout 1961–2050, a large 
majority (80–85%) even on vastly insufficient mountain runoff. In addition, the immense irrigation system 
makes unsustainable use of local blue water resources and depends critically on mountain surpluses. Conflict 
potential over use of mountain runoff and vulnerability to changes are high. 
The Niger River basin (without Benue River) shows a marked increase in dependent lowland population, from 
only 4% in the 1960s to a projected 40% in the 2040s (SSP2). Together with a sevenfold increase in lowland 
population 1961–2050 and low but stable lowland per-capita water consumption, this puts 73 M lowland 
inhabitants in dependency on mountain water resources by the 2040s. 
In the lowlands of the Nile River basin, dependency on contributions from the two mountainous source areas is 
constantly high at 80–85% of population and concentrates on the lower parts and the delta area in Egypt, as well 
as on the South of Sudan. 21% of lowland population were dependent on vastly insufficient mountain surpluses 
in the 1960s, with a projected rise to 53% in the 2040s (SSP2). Projected lowland population growth 1961–2050 
is more than fourfold and sets off a decrease in lowland per-capita water consumption of roughly 60%. Efforts to 
make more extensive use of water upstream in the Ethiopian Highlands (Blue Nile River) bear considerable 
conflict potential. 
The Yangtze River basin’s mountain runoff is under high pressure of use, not only in the basin’s lowlands 
where 263 M people (74% of lowland population) depend on it in the 2000s: Interbasin water transfers to the 
rivers further north compensate for absence of mountain surpluses in the Yellow River basin (projected to cease 
in the 2020s) and the Hai He River basin (missing from the 1960s onwards) that together had a lowland 
population of 141 M in the 2000s. The lowlands of all three river basins are characterised by high population 
density and extensive irrigated agriculture, and lowland per-capita water consumption is projected to rise 
strongly, especially in the Yellow and Hai He River basins where 1960s values are expected to roughly double 
by the 2040s. 
In the Colorado River basin (US and Mexico), almost the entire lowland population (96–100%) depends on 
vastly insufficient mountain water resources throughout 1961–2050, even though lowland per-capita water 
consumption halves over this time. This critical dependence extends to irrigated agriculture that made 
unsustainable use of local blue water already in the 1960s, and is exacerbated by interbasin transfers to south-
western California including Greater Los Angeles. These conditions foster disputes over water use between 
Mexico and the US, and even within the US, and render water users vulnerable to drought events.

Methods 
Catchments. We perform our analyses individually for each river catchment with an area of 10 000 km² or 
more. Smaller catchments are aggregated to groups contributing to the same coastal segment1, and each of these 
groups is analysed individually as well. All results are then composited for a global map. This scheme follows 
the framework developed in ref. 2 whereas the original catchment boundaries and the coastal segmentation were 
refined from 30’ (arc minutes, ~56 km at the Equator) to 5’ (~9 km) resolution using high-resolution 
hydrographic information3,4 and a detailed topographic atlas5. 
To establish a hydrological connection between large urban areas at the coast and major rivers nearby, the 
catchments of 48 rivers were extended to contain major delta areas6. Depending on the prevailing conditions, the 
main river catchment is thus extended by areas with high population and high runoff (e.g., Ganges-Brahmaputra-
Meghna, Mississippi and Niger River Deltas), high population and low runoff (e.g., Indus, Nile and Yellow 
River Deltas), low population and high runoff (e.g., Amazon River Delta), as well as low population and low 
runoff (e.g., Lena and Mackenzie River Deltas). River systems are analysed jointly if they all contribute to the 
same delta area and, in addition, delta morphology and population distribution make it difficult to attribute the 
flow of the individual rivers to individual population centres. This is the case for the Ganges, Brahmaputra and 
Meghna Rivers (Bengal Delta), the Rhine, Meuse and Scheulte Rivers (Rhine Delta) and the Pearl, West, North 
and East Rivers (Pearl River Delta). 
Due to a lack of reliable and comprehensive data, actual water transfers from one basin to another (interbasin 
transfers, e.g. from Yangtze River in northern direction) are not considered. For similar reasons, the hydrological 
link to irrigated areas situated outside of the supplying catchment is not established (relevant e.g. in the Nile 
River catchment). Both factors should be included in future studies with more regional focus, provided that 
suitable data become available. 
We keep river network and thus catchment boundaries constant over time and do not consider the potential 
segmentation and shortening of rivers in dry regions that could result from reduced runoff (e.g., upper Niger 
River, White Nile River, Chari and Logone Rivers, Tarim River). 
Mountain and lowland areas. We use “mountains” and “mountain areas” as extended geographic terms rather 
than in a strict geomorphologic sense. They encompass elevated terrain with potentially high relevance in water 
resources for the subjacent lowlands and refer to areas that are characterised with the symbolic term “water 
towers”2,7. Mountain areas have their counterpart in lowland areas, which are the areas that depend on mountain 
water resources, and are affected by environmental and societal change in mountain areas8,9. This follows earlier 
mountain-related studies on global change (e.g., refs. 10,11) and water resources (e.g., refs. 2,12), rooted in the 
physical and socioeconomic linkages between mountain and lowland areas. A related concept is that of 
“highland-lowland interactive systems” as examined in a United Nations University (UNU) programme initiated 
in 197813,14. 
More specifically, our definition of mountain areas is based on a comprehensive typology of relief roughness and 
elevation. This typology, originally conceived at a resolution of 30’ (see ref. 15 for details), was enhanced for our 
resolution of 5’ on the basis of a high-resolution (7.5”, arc seconds, ~0.23 km at the Equator) Digital Terrain 
Model (DTM)16 (Supplementary Fig. S1). Following an earlier typology of global mountain water resources2, we 
then chose a rather extensive definition that covers mountain areas of low, middle, high and very high elevation 
and also includes rugged hills as well as plateaux of medium, high and very high elevation. This is imperative 
because all of these relief classes can have an important role in providing runoff to lowland areas2. A further 
differentiation of results into relief types (as provided in ref. 2) could reveal additional patterns but is beyond the 
scope of the present study, and not necessary for the overview envisaged here. 
In detail, our definition of mountain areas includes (1) all areas above 200 m a.s.l. if their relief roughness (RR) 
is at least 45‰, (2) all areas above 500 m a.s.l. if RR is at least 21‰, (3) all areas above 1 000 m a.s.l. if RR is at 
least 10‰, and (4) all areas above 1 500 m a.s.l. regardless of RR. Criterion (3) is an addition to the original 
typology that was necessary to depict more realistically high-elevation lowland areas at our improved resolution, 
most of all in the Kalahari Desert and the Tarim Basin. It should be noted that this additional criterion might mix 
low-elevation regions (e.g., alluvial plains) with higher-elevation areas in some exorheic regions such as South 
Africa. The thresholds for RR were adapted from ref. 2 to reflect the relation between resolution of the detail 
DTM and that of the results in our study (7.5” to 5’), which slightly differs from the original relation (30” to 
 
16 
30’). To classify lakes in a way meaningful for our study, we assigned them the average RR of the raster cells 
along their outline and then classified them using above rules. This procedure was applied to all natural and 
dammed lakes with an area of at least 50 km2, except for the Caspian Sea that was not considered part of the land 
mass. To achieve a more consistent delineation of mountain areas, single isolated mountain cells within lowland 
areas were eliminated by retaining the more frequent of the two classes in a moving window of 5×5 raster cells. 
As a result, 39% of global land surface area (132.7·106 km2, omitting Greenland and Antarctica, but including 
endorheic areas) is classified as mountains, the remaining area as lowlands. This re-creates the extent chosen in 
an earlier typology of mountains as “water towers”2 and roughly compares to the figure of 36% of land area 
mentioned by ref. 17 as belonging to mountain and hilly terrain on the basis of relative relief and roughness. 
In reality, there is of course no sharp boundary between mountain and lowland areas as we assume it here, and 
the criteria for narrowing down such a boundary zone should be regarded “elastic” to some extent18. It has 
however been shown in an earlier study that the assumptions made here lead to a consistent analysis framework, 
and that the results are relevant in the context of water resources2. For the present study, we have also tested 
slightly altered definitions for mountain and lowland areas. These experiments did not lead to fundamentally 
changed patterns as compared to the ones presented here, so that our results can be considered robust. 
In contrast to the upstream-downstream dichotomy that applies to all river catchments (see e.g. refs. 19,20,21), there 
are basins without significant mountain areas (e.g., Dnepr River) as well as basins without significant lowland 
areas (e.g., the endorheic Salar de Uyuni). To obtain area-wide mapping nevertheless, a hypothetical lowland 
area was added to catchments that had not a single raster cell classified as lowland. This hypothetical lowland 
area was defined as a circular area with a radius of two raster cells, located at the lowest point of the catchment 
in question. In a similar fashion, a hypothetical mountain area was added at the highest point of catchments that 
had not a single pixel classified as mountainous. In summary analyses, however, lowland catchments with a 
share of mountain area of less than 5% were not assessed because the significance of runoff contributions from 
mountain areas might appear exaggerated. Instead, these catchments were mapped as a separate category, and 
their full results are found in Supplementary Fig. S10. The lowland population of catchments with a share in 
mountain area smaller than 5% is constantly about 11% of total lowland population (269 M in 1961–1970, 
689 M in 2041–2050 under SSP2). We also tested excluding catchments with a share of mountain area of less 
than 10%, or not applying such a threshold at all, finding that the overall results did not change more than a few 
percent in most catchments. Additional context to this point is provided through an assessment of the overall 
contribution of mountain areas to total catchment discharge (Supplementary Fig. S11a) and setting this 
contribution in relation to the share that mountains have in total catchment area (Supplementary Fig. S11b). In 
principle, these two analyses could also have provided a threshold for excluding catchments where mountains 
have only minor importance in lowland hydrology. However, such a threshold already contains hydrological 
information. To avoid circular argumentation, we retained the strictly physiographical threshold based on area 
and thus on relief roughness and elevation. 
Dependence of lowland areas on mountain water resources. Our assessment is based on a water balance for 
each raster cell of the lowland part of a catchment (𝒃𝑳) and an average water balance for the mountain part of the 
same catchment (𝒃̅𝑴) (Fig. 1a): 
 
𝒃𝑳[𝒊, 𝒋] = 𝒓𝑳[𝒊, 𝒋] − 𝒖𝑳[𝒊, 𝒋] − 𝒆𝑳[𝒊, 𝒋] 
(1a) 
 
𝒃̅𝑴[𝒋] = 𝒓̅𝑴[𝒋] − 𝒖̅𝑴[𝒋] − 𝒆̅𝑴[𝒋]  
(1b) 
For each lowland raster cell 𝒊 of catchment 𝒋, 𝒓𝑳[𝒊, 𝒋] is runoff, 𝒖𝑳[𝒊, 𝒋] is consumptive water use, and 𝒆𝑳[𝒊, 𝒋] is 
minimum ecological flow. For the mountain area of catchment 𝒋, 𝒓̅𝑴[𝒋] is average runoff, 𝒖̅𝑴[𝒋] is average 
consumptive water use, and 𝒆̅𝑴[𝒋] is average of minimum ecological flow. 
We then further develop and extend the methods of ref. 2 to compute a water resources index 𝑾 for each lowland 
raster cell 𝒊 belonging to catchment 𝒋 as 
 
𝑾[𝒊, 𝒋] = {𝒃𝑳[𝒊, 𝒋] 𝒃̅𝑴[𝒋]
⁄
if 𝒃̅𝑴[𝒋] > 𝟎
𝟎
otherwise   
(2) 
 
17 
In essence, 𝑾 quantifies to what extent a raster cell in the lowlands potentially depends on mountain water 
surpluses. Its values are classified using the following ranges (Fig. 1b): 
𝑾≤−𝟐: Essential, but vastly insufficient (red). The lowland raster cell has a deficit at least two times larger in 
absolute value than the average mountain surplus. 
−𝟐< 𝑾≤−𝟏: Essential, but insufficient (orange). The lowland raster cell has a deficit larger in absolute value 
than the average mountain surplus. 
𝟎< 𝑾< −𝟏: Essential, and sufficient (yellow). The lowland raster cell has a deficit smaller in absolute value 
than the average mountain surplus. 
𝑾= 𝟎: No surplus (grey). The entire lowland basin cannot benefit from mountain surpluses. 
𝟎< 𝑾≤𝟏: Supportive (green). The lowland raster cell has a surplus, but the average mountain surplus is even 
larger than that. 
𝟏≤𝑾< 𝟐: Minor (cyan). The lowland raster cell has a surplus larger than the average mountain surplus. 
𝑾≥𝟐: Negligible (navy). The lowland raster cell has a surplus more than two times larger than the average 
mountain surplus. 
Mentions of “essential” in the main text include categories “essential, and sufficient”, “essential, but 
insufficient” and “essential, but vastly insufficient” (𝑾< 𝟎), mentions of “essential but insufficient” encompass 
categories “essential, but insufficient” and “essential, but vastly insufficient” (𝑾≤−𝟏). 
The case where mountain areas provide no surplus on average (𝒃̅𝑴[𝒋] ≤𝟎) can be due to low runoff from 
mountains (less than 30 mm a-1, which is a threshold for permanent river flow22), high consumptive water use in 
mountain areas (more than 18.6 mm a-1, which is the average value 2001–2010 for all land surface area 
excluding Greenland and Antarctica), or both. A distinction of these cases was not made in the main maps (Fig. 
3) for reasons of clarity, but is provided separately in Supplementary Fig. S3. Note that following ref. 2, we 
chose a fixed threshold for high consumptive water use rather than one relative to local runoff, as such a fixed 
threshold is comparable across different regions world-wide. The extent of arheic mountain regions (mean 
decadal runoff below 3 mm a-1 following ref. 22) is given for additional interpretation in Supplementary Fig. S12. 
The major difference to earlier studies on “water towers”2 is that here we can explicitly analyse lowland areas, 
and thus map and quantify the dependence of its population on mountain runoff. This was not feasible with the 
earlier typology that addressed mountain areas and compared their runoff to bulk estimates for lowland water 
resources. Apart from that, two further important extensions were made: First, we have implemented realistic 
estimates for consumptive water use, based on a global model that is calibrated against observed water 
consumption (see Consumptive water use, below). As compared to figures estimated from an assumed minimum 
per capita need and population counts (as also used in ref. 2), this leads to lower estimates of consumptive water 
use in Africa, and higher estimates in Asia. In addition, it ensures that population growth does not automatically 
lead to increased total consumptive water use, and considers increases in water use efficiency23 (Supplementary 
Fig. S8). Second, we here consider environmental minimum ecological flow, which leads to improved validity of 
our results for sustainable management of water resources. 
In our assessment, we do not discern between lowland regions situated at different tributaries of the main river, 
and thus neglect possible hydrographic links to individual mountain areas within the same catchment. The only 
exception is the Benue River, which we separated from the Niger River and analysed as an individual catchment 
because its path follows a climatically very distinct route2,24. Here, a joint analysis would strongly confound the 
impact of the two rivers’ mountain areas on the lowlands. After separation, the two river catchments are still of 
major size (Benue River: 339·103 km2; remainder of Niger River: 1 759·103 km2). Further refinements in this 
direction should be made in future studies at the level of individual catchments. 
The values of 𝑾 evolve over time, reflecting changes in runoff and consumptive water use in both lowland and 
mountain areas (see also Drivers of changes, below). 
 
18 
Finally, it is important to stress that we assume mountain area surpluses, if available, to alleviate the pressure on 
water resources in the entire lowland part of a basin. In absence of comprehensive data, we thus refrain from 
implementing assumptions about water transfers that may not be correct in the individual case. Rather, we follow 
ref. 25 and assume that water from rivers is usually transferred effectively within a basin, and that water 
availability usually does not decrease much with distance from the main rivers. Where mountain surpluses are 
not distributed with help of engineering, they can still effect an indirect alleviation because competition for water 
resources from the river system is reduced in the entire lowland area of a catchment. 
Water availability. To estimate water availability we used the state-of-the-art global hydrological and water 
resources model PCR-GLOBWB (version 2.0) that integrates human activities including water use and reservoir 
regulation into hydrology at a daily temporal resolution. The detailed description of the basic hydrologic model 
structure and associated calculation, and water use calculation, is found in ref. 26. Below, we briefly present the 
main features of the model as concerns hydrologic calculations. The model’s representation of consumptive 
water use is introduced further below. 
PCR-GLOBWB simulates for each raster cell and for each time step (daily) the water storage in two vertically 
stacked soil layers and an underlying groundwater layer, as well as the water exchange between the layers 
(infiltration, percolation, and capillary rise) and between the top layer and the atmosphere (rainfall, 
evapotranspiration and snow melt). The model also calculates canopy interception and snow storage. Snow 
accumulation and melt are temperature driven and modelled according to the snow module of the Hydrologiska 
Byråns Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) model27, using fixed values for the temperature of rain-snow transition 
(0° C) and the degree day factor. We argue that this is sufficient for the decadal time scale we are considering, 
including the projections. Ice accumulation and melt are modelled via the HBV degree day method, and we do 
not capture the rise and subsequent decline of glacier melt runoff over the decades in a changing climate (as e.g. 
examined by ref. 28  while keeping constant other components of the water balance such as precipitation and 
evapotranspiration). Given that ice melt contributions to total runoff become small to negligible with increasing 
distance from the glaciers in most regions29, this limitation of all current global models does not call into 
question our findings30. Sub-grid variability is taken into account by considering separately tall and short 
vegetation, paddy rice, nonpaddy crops, rainfed crop, open water (lakes, reservoirs, floodplains and wetlands), 
different soil types, and the area fraction of saturated soil calculated with the improved Arno scheme31 as well as 
the frequency distribution of groundwater depth based on the surface elevations of the HYDRO1k Elevation 
Derivative Database32. For snow, subgrid variability is represented via elevation dependent gradients of 
temperature (0.65° C per 100 m) over 10 elevation zones for each raster cell, again based on HYDRO1k30. The 
groundwater store is explicitly parameterized based on lithology and topography. Natural groundwater recharge 
fed by net precipitation, and additional recharge fluxes from irrigation, i.e. return flow, fed by irrigation water 
supply and from industrial and domestic sectors occurs as the net flux from the lowest soil layer to the 
groundwater layer, i.e. deep percolation minus capillary rise. Groundwater recharge interacts with groundwater 
storage by capillary rise and baseflow. 
Model outputs were processed with a robust smoothing algorithm33 to remove artefacts. This was necessary 
because parts of the model input data are currently available at 30’ resolution only, occasionally leading to sharp 
boundaries in the outputs. It was ensured that the gross water availability sum remained unchanged. 
Consumptive water use. Water demands were calculated with the same model as water availability, namely 
PCR-GLOBWB 2. For irrigation, this model implements a daily scheme that separately parameterizes paddy 
and non-paddy crops and dynamically links with hydrological fluxes considering the feedback between the 
application of irrigation water and the corresponding changes in surface and soil water balance, and 
evapotranspiration. The losses (i.e., return flow) during water transport and irrigation application are included in 
the simulation based on daily evaporative and percolation losses per unit crop area based on the surface and soil 
water balance. For the industrial sector, the model calculates country-specific water use intensities based on 
economic development and technological improvement. Domestic water demand is estimated by multiplying the 
number of persons in a raster cell with the country-specific per capita domestic water extraction (FAO 
AQUASTAT; see Data availability, below). Daily water demand variations are determined using daily air 
temperature as a proxy34. The country per capita domestic water extraction in 2000 is multiplied with the 
estimated water use intensities to account for economic and technological development. Details are provided in 
ref. 34 for the past and ref. 26 for projections. For a validation of simulated sectoral water use (where data are 
available) see ref. 35. 
 
19 
As regards regionalisation of consumptive water use for the SSP scenarios, it has to be mentioned that the 
original IPCC SSP scenarios do not include information on specific water demands. Therefore, the present study 
uses state-of-the-art water demand projections based on the Water Futures and Solutions (WFaS) initiative and 
reported in ref. 23. For these projections, regional sectoral water demand scenarios were constructed that are 
consistent with the SSP scenario storylines. 
After water is withdrawn for the irrigation, industrial and domestic sectors, return flow occurs to the river system. 
For the irrigation sector, return flow (losses) during water transport and irrigation application are simulated based 
on daily evaporative and percolation losses based on the surface and soil water balance. For the industrial and 
domestic sectors, return flow occurs on the same day (no retention due to wastewater treatment). For the domestic 
sector, the return flow occurs only from the areas where urban and rural population have access to water, whereas 
for the industry sector, the return flow occurs from all areas where water is withdrawn. For both sectors, the amount 
of return flow is determined by recycling ratios developed per country. The country-specific water recycling is 
calculated according to the method developed in ref. 34. For completeness, we note that consumptive water use is 
equal to water withdrawal minus return flow. 
Model outputs were processed with the same robust smoothing algorithm that was used for water availability 
(see above). 
Historical climate and climate scenarios. The historical forcing data set for 1961–2010 is based on time series 
of monthly precipitation, temperature, and reference evaporation from the CRU TS 3.2 data set36, disaggregated 
to daily values with ERA4037 (1961–1978) and ERA-Interim38 (1979–2010) (for further details see ref. 30). 
Wind-induced undercatch (particularly relevant in mountain areas) and wetting losses in precipitation have been 
adjusted using gridded mean monthly catch ratios39. For projections in the time after 2010, we used the RCP4.5 
(with SSP1) and RCP6.0 (with SSP2 and SSP3) scenarios with an ensemble of 5 CMIP5 GCMs (GFDL-
ESM2M, HadGEM2-ES, IPSL-CM5A-LR, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, NorESM1-M; see ref. 40) based on the 
ISIMIP project (https://www.isimip.org). All analyses were done individually for each GCM first, and median 
and range were then computed from these results. 
Downscaling. While downscaling was not necessary for the historical period, future water availability under 
different scenarios had to be downscaled from 30’ to 5’ to achieve a consistent resolution of past, present and 
future data. We used a delta change method in which we first aggregated our high resolution runoff values (at 5’) 
for 2001–2010 to the lower resolution of 30’. These 30’ runoff data were then compared to 30’ values for 2001–
2010 derived from the five GCMs we use, and grid specific differences between these two datasets were 
computed. These differences were then used to bias-correct the future 30’ GCM data. Finally, the bias-corrected 
future data were compared with the aggregated 2001–2010 runoff, and differences (deltas) were derived. To 
achieve future runoff at 5’, these deltas were multiplied with present 5’ runoff. Essentially the same procedure 
was used for downscaling projected consumptive water use, whereas bias correction was done at country scale 
(rather than at grid scale as in the case of runoff) because the data required for calculating irrigation water 
demand are available mostly at that scale only. 
Minimum ecological flow requirements. Minimum ecological flow was first computed as a fraction of total 
annual runoff at a resolution of 30’, following the Variable Monthly Flow (VMF) method41. We used a uniform 
minimum ecological flow fraction for the whole study period to avoid introducing additional variables to our 
analysis. It was calculated by using average monthly runoff over 5 GCMs (GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-ES, 
IPSL-CM5A-LR, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, NorESM1-M) in the period of 1971–2050 (ref. 40). We could not 
include the 1961–1970 decade into these calculations, as data for some GCMs used start from 1971 only. This 
uniform fraction was then multiplied with the actual annual runoff sums to get an absolute value of minimum 
ecological flow for each time period analysed. 
Population scenarios. Population figures at 5’ resolution were extracted from the HYDE 3.2 database42, using 
the SSP1, SSP2 and SSP3 pathways for projected population from 2016 onwards. We focus on the “middle of 
the road” pathway SSP2 and add SSP1 and SSP3 in selected results to explore the spread caused by the different 
pathways (Supplementary Fig. S8). 
Drivers of changes. Changes in the potential dependence of lowlands on mountain water resources (water 
resources index 𝑾, Equation 2) were analysed with a view to dominant driving factors. As a basis, we identified 
four potentially relevant drivers: changes in mountain runoff (𝒓𝑴), changes in lowland runoff (𝒓𝑳), changes in 
 
20 
mountain consumptive water use (𝒖𝑴), and changes in lowland consumptive water use (𝒖𝑳). The impact of each 
driver was analysed separately, keeping all other inputs constant at the level of 1961–1970. Where runoff was 
changed for a driver analysis, the corresponding minimum ecological flow requirements (𝒆𝑴, 𝒆𝑳) were re-
computed accordingly. 
We then assessed the impacts of these drivers on the dependence of lowland areas on mountain water resources 
2041–2050 and computed how many lowland inhabitants are changing category. As a baseline for the 
comparison, we assumed that runoff and total consumptive water use remain constant at the level of 1961–1970. 
The baseline result is thus based on the spatial patterns 1961–1970 (Fig. 3a), and applies these patterns on 
projected population 2041–2050. 
For visualising the detailed class changes (Supplementary Fig. S13), we used the “circlize” (Circular 
Visualization) package for R by Zuguang Gu43. It follows from our methods that some changes can only be 
caused by certain drivers: First, a change from “supportive” (green), “minor” (cyan) or “negligible” (navy) to 
“essential, and sufficient” (yellow), “essential, but insufficient” (orange) or “essential, but vastly insufficient” 
(red) requires that the lowland water balance shifts from positive to negative. This can only be caused by 
changes in lowland runoff (𝒓𝑳), lowland consumptive water use (𝒖𝑳), or both. The same is true for a change in 
the reverse direction, where the lowland balance shifts from negative to positive. Second, any change to “no 
surplus” (grey) requires that the mountain water balance shifts from positive to negative, which is possible only 
through changes in mountain runoff (𝒓𝑴), mountain consumptive water use (𝒖𝑴), or both. This is again valid for 
changes in the reverse direction, where the mountain balance shifts from negative to positive. 
It should be noted that we assess how many people move from one category to another, and do not consider here 
how big the change in 𝑾 actually is. In principle, this means that small changes in 𝑾 may still cause a shift in 
category if its value is close to a category boundary. We argue that this simplification is justifiable to obtain a 
clear presentation of the results, and is not a major limitation since we are mainly interested in a comparison 
between various scenarios. 
It should further be noted that the category changes given for the individual drivers do not sum up to the overall 
category changes. This is because the population in a lowland raster cell may be affected by changes in more 
than one driver, and summing up the corresponding results is not always meaningful, e.g. when only the 
combined impact of more than one driver leads to a category change, or the combined impact leads to a more 
extensive change in category than only one driver, or when changes in opposite direction balance each other.  
Hydrobelts. Hydrobelts represent an aggregation of natural hydrological basins based on similarities of their 
characteristic hydroclimatic features44. These features include annual runoff and average annual air temperature. 
The aggregation results in eight hydroclimatically homogeneous and near-contiguous regions, and these are used 
in the present study to report the regional scale results. Hydrobelts were designed specifically for high resolution 
analyses, and as they follow the boundaries of hydrological basins, the contrast between individual regions is 
more marked as compared to hydroclimatic zones, both as concerns the present state as well as the evolution 
over time (see ref. 44 for details). The original delineation at 30’ resolution was refined to 5’ with help of 
similarly refined coastal segments, and considers important delta areas (see Catchments, above). 
Irrigated areas and food production. Spatially explicit data on areas equipped for irrigation at 5’ resolution are 
from ref. 45. For period 1961–1970, the average of years 1960 and 1970 was used, for period 2001–2010 the year 
2005 was used. For period 2041–2050, we assumed that irrigated area is similar to period 2001–2010. Spatially 
explicit estimates of food production for year 2000 (5’) are from ref. 46. It should be noted that the food 
production data refer to both rainfed and irrigated agriculture. Interpretation of these data (Supplementary Fig. 
S5c, d) should therefore be made in connection with the extent of irrigated areas (Supplementary Fig. S5a, b) and 
bearing in mind that 40–45% of the world’s food originates from irrigated agriculture47. 
Sustainability of blue water use. We used the BlWSI (blue water sustainability index) index from ref. 48 that 
expresses the fraction of consumptive blue water use met from non-sustainable water resources, i.e. from non-
renewable groundwater abstraction and surface water over-abstraction. The index is dimensionless and ranges 
between 0 and 1, whereas we assumed a threshold of 0.2 to define non-sustainable use of blue water. Projected 
data for BlWSI are available for SSP2-RCP6.0 only, and in consequence it was not possible to examine 
alternative pathways.

Results from projections with alternative scenarios 
To test the sensitivity of our projected results towards scenarios, we ran the analysis for the SSP1-RCP4.5, 
SSP2-RCP6.0 and SSP3-RCP6.0 pathways. In terms of global-scale patterns, results show no major differences, 
and the share of people residing in the individual classes in 2041–2050 does not differ by more than 1–2% 
between scenarios (Supplementary Fig. S14). The share of total lowland population depending on essential 
contributions from mountain areas ranges between 38.5% (SSP1-RCP4.5) and 40.1% (SSP3-RCP6.0). However, 
the absolute number of people assigned to the classes differs more strongly between scenarios because the 
growth in total population diverges in the underlying SSPs (Supplementary Fig. S8): The absolute lowland 
population projected to depend on essential contributions from mountain areas ranges between 2.3 B (SSP1-
RCP4.5) and 2.7 B (SSP3-RCP6.0). At the level of hydrobelts, the largest differences in dependency on 
mountain areas are found where population development also shows wider divergence between scenarios, such 
as in the North suptropical hydrobelt. Scenario differences between projected per-capita consumptive water use, 
on the other hand, seem less important, as can be seen in the Boreal hydrobelt. The individual GCM members of 
the scenarios examined show high agreement in wide parts of the lowland area (Supplementary Fig. S15). 
Examples for a widespread lower agreement are found in parts of the Amazon River basin and on the Arabian 
Peninsula, where lowland population density is generally low. 
Simulated water availability in mountain areas 
A known issue of current macroscale hydrological models is that they tend to underestimate mean annual 
discharge over mountainous areas1. For PCR-GLOBWB 2, however, it has been shown that model efficiency at 
daily time step has improved significantly for areas above 1 000 m a.s.l. with using 5’ instead of 30’ resolution 
(as in this study), and is only slightly inferior to efficiency below 1 000 m a.s.l. (Supplementary Fig. S16). The 
comparison was done at ~3 600 Global Runoff Data Center (GRDC) sites and highlights the advantages of using 
5’ resolution for assessing the dependency of lowlands on mountain runoff (see ref. 2 for details). 
We further compared PCR-GLOBWB 2 mean annual discharge 1961–2010 to long-term mean annual discharge 
reported in the Global Streamflow Characteristics Dataset (GSCD)1. GSCD has no explicit timeframe due to the 
use of records with a broad range of start dates and duration, and it should be mentioned that the dataset is 
similarly limited by the general lack of hydrometeorological observations at high elevations3 as any global 
hydrological model is. An analysis for 100 m elevation bands (Supplementary Fig. S17) shows that 
 
S2 
PCR-GLOBWB 2 and GSCD results agree to a high degree at global scale, with PCR-GLOBWB 2 generally 
having slightly lower discharge values. Similarly high agreement is found in the North mid-latitude, North 
subtropical, Equator, South subtropical and South dry hydrobelts. The first two of these are the most populous of 
all global hydrobelts, with 3.10 B and 1.42 B lowland inhabitants in the 2000s, respectively, and encompassing 
over 70% of total lowland population. Increasing disagreement towards low elevations is apparent in the Boreal 
and South mid-latitude hydrobelts, where PCR-GLOBWB 2 shows lower values than GSCD. Lowland 
population counts are only 0.10 and 0.09 B, respectively. Some disagreement at high elevations is noted in the 
North dry hydrobelt (0.63 B lowland inhabitants), where GSCD generally shows a smoother decline of discharge 
with elevation than PCR-GLOBWB 2. Between roughly 2 000–4 000 m a.s.l., GSCD discharge is higher, above 
that PCR-GLOBWB 2 discharge. 
Finally, we tested the robustness of our analysis framework by adjusting PCR-GLOBWB 2 runoff to GSCD 
runoff. In detail, we computed a cell-by-cell adjustment factor from PCR-GLOBWB 2 (1961–2010) to GSCD 
(no explicit timeframe), limited the adjustment factor to a range of 0.2–5.0 to avoid highly implausible results in 
areas with low runoff and then applied it to PCR-GLOBWB 2 mean annual runoff 2001–2010. Simulated 
consumptive water use was left unchanged. It has to be mentioned that GSCD should actually not be used for 
catchments larger than 10 000 km². This limitation in scale seems less important for our cell-by-cell assessment 
of lowland regions but could still be relevant in the average water balance we set up for the mountain parts of 
larger river basins. 
The comparison of results for 2001–2010 reveals that adjusted PCR-GLOBWB 2 data assigns more people to the 
“essential but sufficient” category (28% instead of 21%) and less to the “minor” category (6% instead of 11%) 
(Supplementary Fig. S18). Differences in the other categories are small. It should be stressed again that also the 
GSCD data are subject to considerable uncertainty at higher elevations (especially in South America, Africa and 
Asia) due to the scarcity of direct observations of runoff. Because of these limitations and because GSCD has an 
ambiguous timeframe, we kept using the unadjusted PCR-GLOBWB 2 that implies a slightly lower dependence 
of lowland inhabitants on mountain water resources. 
An assessment based on additional global hydrological and water resources models would be desirable in the 
future to further quantify uncertainties, but was not feasible for this study as such data are currently not available 
from other models at the resolution we are using. 
To conclude, it has to be stressed that our goal is a global overview. We identify lowland regions that show 
critical dependence on mountain water resources, and recognise past trends and possible future developments 
relevant for water resources management in the context of highland-lowland interactions. Such analyses depend 
on Global Hydrological Models (GHMs), and these are in turn limited in terms of accuracy, depiction of physical 
processes and parameterisation of human impacts, especially in upstream catchments4. Within the scope of our 
analysis, i.e. for studying decadal patterns and related changes at global scale, GHMs can be considered highly 
useful and adequate tools. When it comes to specific river basins and details of water resources management at 
seasonal scale, however, regional hydrological models should be employed5. 
Development of consumptive water use 
Figures for simulated per-capita consumptive water use 1961–2050 are shown in Supplementary Fig. S8, 
revealing a relatively stable global average around 400 m3 p-1 a-1 for the lowlands and slightly lower values for 
mountain areas, where a decrease from 385 (1961–1970) to 330 m3 p-1 a-1 (2041–2050, median of the three 
SSP-RCP scenarios) is noted. At the level of hydrobelts, increasing per-capita values in both mountain and 
lowland areas are found in the Boreal (mainly driven by Eastern Europe) and the North mid-latitude hydrobelts, 
as well as in the South mid-latitude belt (mainly driven by Australia, in the lowlands however with a decline 
after 2001–2010). Decreasing values are found in the North dry, North subtropical, Equator and South dry 
hydrobelts. 
Drivers of changes 
In the results for the “no surplus” (grey) category, the impacts of the individual drivers reported in Table 2 
(+3 M lowland people for changed mountain runoff; +171 M for changed mountain consumptive water use) fall 
strikingly short of the overall impact (+316 M). This is because the entire lowland of a catchment is either fully 
in the “no surplus” category or not at all (see Methods), and some catchments move into this category only 
through the combined impact of changes in mountain runoff and consumptive water use. The most important 
 
S3 
cases in this respect are found on the Indian Peninsula, namely the Krishna (lowland population of 83 M in 
2041–2050), Sabarmati (21 M) and Penneru (10 M) River catchments (Supplementary Table S1).

(see main text), both excluding Greenland and Antarctica. Large lakes (>50 km2) are drawn here using their
actual relief roughness (which is zero) rather than the assumed average roughness used for distinguishing
mountain and lowland areas (Methods). The boundaries of catchments with an area of 100 000 km² and more are
drawn for orientation.

Supplementary Figure S10. Potential dependence on mountain resources 1961–2050, spatial patterns for
catchments with a share in mountain area of less than 5%. Results are shown from the viewpoint of lowland
areas for the time periods 1961–1970 (a), 2001–2010 (b) and 2041–2050 (c). The boundaries of catchments with
an area of 100 000 km² and more are drawn for orientation, and projections refer to the SSP2-RCP6.0 scenario.
See also Fig. 3a–c in main article. Since the share of mountains is small, results should be interpreted carefully
and bearing in mind mountain contributions to total catchment runoﬀ(cf. Supplementary Fig. S11).

Supplementary Figure S11. Contribution of mountains to total catchment discharge (a) and ratio of
mountain share in total catchment discharge to mountain share in total catchment area (b) 2001–2010. In
(a), a ﬁgure of 100% means that all discharge in a basin originates in its mountain area, and 0% that all discharge
originates in its lowland area. In (b), a value of 1 means that mountains contribute as much to total catchment
discharge as they do to total catchment area. Values above 1 denote disproportionally high discharge
contributions from mountains, values below 1 disproportionally low discharge contributions from mountains.
For both computations, results are shown for the time period 2001–2010 only since changes over the timeframe
1961–2050 are small. The boundaries of catchments with an area of 100 000 km² and more are drawn for
orientation.

Supplementary Figure S13. Detailed breakdown of drivers causing changes in dependence on mountain
water resources 2041–2050. As a baseline, the bottom part of each circular plot represents the number of
lowland inhabitants per category 2041–2050, assuming that runoﬀand total water consumption remain
unchanged at 1961–1970 level. The corresponding population numbers are noted under the sectors in Panel a
(e.g., 962 M lowland inhabitants potentially depend on essential and suﬃcient contributions form mountain
areas). The top part of the circular plot in Panel a shows results for 2041–2050 under changed conditions as
projected with the SSP2-RCP6.0 scenario, and as shown in the main article. Panels b to e then each show results
for changes in only one driver, namely mountain runoﬀ(b), mountain water consumption (c), lowland runoﬀ(d),
and lowland water consumption (e), all referring to SSP2-RCP6.0. The changes in population per category are
noted above each sector for all panels, giving the numbers reported in Table 2 of the main text.
