Abstract
Three mixed-metal nitrilotriacetates [Ba(H2O)3
Co(nta)Cl]n (1), [Ba(H2O)3Ni(nta)Cl]n (2), and [Ba(H2O)3
Cu(nta)Cl]n (3) (H3nta = nitrilotriacetic acid) were pre-
pared by the reaction of M2? ions (M = Co, Ni, and Cu),
K3nta, and Ba2? ions in water. The reaction of complexes 1
and
2
with
CuSO45H2O
afforded
[Co(H2O)6]n[Cu2
(nta)2]n2nH2O (4) and [Ni(H2O)6]n[Cu2(nta)2]n2nH2O
(5), respectively. The reaction mechanism was elucidated.
The crystal structure analyses indicate that the Ba2? ions
formed one-dimensional (1D) zigzag chains in complex 3,
and the chains were connected by Cu(nta)- anions to form
a three-dimensional network. On the other hand, in com-
plexes 4 and 5, the Cu(nta)- anions formed 1D zigzag
chains, and the [Co(H2O)6]2? (or [Ni(H2O)6]2?) cations
existed as isolated units.

1 Introduction
In recent years, the use of suitable coordination complexes
as the building blocks for the synthesis of oligomers or
polymers has attracted much interest. Indeed, many mate-
rials obtained by self-assembly synthesis strategies exhibit
novel structural topologies and/or suitable optical and/or
magnetic properties [1–8]. Nitrilotriacetic acid (H3nta) is
used as a complexing agent to form coordination polymers
[9–13]. Many studies reported that protonated and depro-
tonated nitrilotriacetates afforded various Cu complexes,
and the nitrilotriacetato ligand behaved as a tridentate or
tetradentate chelate that binds through the amino N and
carboxyl O atoms [14–19]. Among these complexes, sev-
eral Cu atoms acted as tetradentate chelating agents instead
of tridentate chelating agents in the formation of coordi-
nation polymer. Herein, we report new types of polymeric
Cu nitrilotriacetate complexes [Co(H2O)6]n[Cu2(nta)2]n
2nH2O (4) and [Ni(H2O)6]n[Cu2(nta)2]n2nH2O (5) using
Co, Ni, and Cu nitrilotriacetate complexes ([Ba(H2O)3
Co(nta)Cl]n (1), [Ba(H2O)3Ni(nta)Cl]n (2), and [Ba(H2O)3
Cu(nta)Cl]n (3)) as the starting materials. The template
effect of the cations, Ba2?, Co2?, and Ni2?, on the struc-
ture of Cu(nta)- anions was investigated.

2.3 Physical Measurements
The infrared (IR) spectra were recorded using a Nicolet
360 FT-IR spectrometer. The elemental analyses were
performed using an EA 1110 elemental analyzer.

radiation
at
298 K. The data were collected for Lorentz and Polariza-
tion effects. An absorption correction was applied using the
SADABS program [20]. The structures were primarily
solved by the WinGX program [21] and reﬁned by full-
matrix least-squares procedures with anisotropic thermal
parameters for all the nonhydrogen atoms with SHELXL-
97 [22]. All the H atoms on carbons were placed in cal-
culated positions and reﬁned in the riding mode. All the H
atoms on H2O molecules were located from the difference
Fourier maps and reﬁned with the O–H bond lengths ﬁxed
at 0.85 A˚ . Summaries of crystallographic data for com-
plexes 1, 3, 4 and 5 are listed in Table 1. Selected bond
distances and bond angles are listed in Tables 2 and 3.
3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Synthesis
Complexes 1, 2, and 3 were directly synthesized by the
reactions of CoCl2, NiCl2, and CuCl2 with nitrilotriacetate,
respectively, and further used as the reactants for the
preparation of complexes 4 and 5. The pH value, molar
ratio of the reactants, and reaction temperature were not
crucial in the formation of complexes 4 and 5. Notably,
strongly bonded monomeric nitrilotriacetato cobalt(II) or
nickel anion was substituted by H2O molecules to form a
tetradentate cation, which was different from the nitrilo-
triacetato Cu(II) anion. This is attributed to the formation
of polymeric Cu nitrilotriacetato anion and the afﬁnity of
Cu2? ion to nta ligand [23, 24]. The coordination constants
(Ka) also show the same result (lgKCo-nta = 10.8, lgKNi-nta =
11.53, and lgKCu-nta = 12.96). The synthetic routes to
complexes 1–5 are shown in Fig. 1.
3.2 Infrared Spectra
In the IR spectra of complexes 4 and 5, the asymmetric
stretching vibrations as(COO-) appear at 1,627 cm-1, and
the symmetric stretching vibrations s(COO-) appear at
1,399 cm-1 for the two complexes (Figure S1). These
bands were shifted to lower wavenumber compared to
those of the free nitrilotriacetato ligand. The additional
bands in the range 750–540 cm-1 can be attributed to the
absorption of Cu–O or Cu–N (Tables 4, 5).
3.3 Description of Crystal Structures
The molecular structure of complex 3 is shown in Fig. 2.
The nta ligand coordinated to Cu in a tetradentate manner
through three carboxyl O atoms (O1, O3, and O5) and one
N atom. The ﬁfth coordination site of Cu was occupied by

a Cl- ion, forming a distorted trigonal bipyramidal coor-
dination polyhedron around Cu (Fig. 2a). The Cu–O bond
lengths [Cu–O(1), 1.970(3) A˚ ; Cu–O(3), 1.976(3) A˚ ; and
Cu–O(5), 2.090(2) A˚ ] and Cu–N bond length [1.999(3) A˚ ]

three H2O molecules, two chelating nta carboxylate O
atoms (O5 and O6), and ﬁve O atoms from symmetry-
related carboxylate of other nta ligands. The Ba2? ions are
bridged by two carboxyl O atoms (O4 and O6) of the nta
ligand with a Ba–Ba distance of 4.598(3) A˚ , forming one-

dimensional (1D) zigzag chains along the c axis (Fig. 2b).
The
barium
chains
were
further
connected
by
the
CuCl(nta)2- anions to form a three-dimensional (3D) net-
work (Fig. 3). Complex 3 is different from complex [La-
CuCl(NTA)(H2O)6]ClO4H2O [25], where the [Cu(nta)Cl]2?
units are linked to each other by La(H2O)6
3?bridges in three
different directions, forming a two-dimensional (2D) metal-
apex honeycomb, and for [Cu(Cl)(NTA)Sm(H2O)6](ClO4)
(H2O) [26], the two [Cu(nta)Cl]2? units are linked to each
other by Sm(H2O)6
3?to form a 1D polymer. Complex 1 is an
allomer of 3; the molecular and crystal structures of complex
1 are shown in the Supplementary Information (Figure S2).
In complex 4, each asymmetric unit contains two Cu2?
ions, both of which lie in the center of a coordination
octahedron (Fig. 4). Each coordination octahedron was
obtained from one N atom and three carboxyl O atoms
from one nta ligand and two carboxyl O atoms from two
adjacent nta ligands. Bridged by the carboxyl O atoms (O6
and O8), the coordination octahedrons are linked to 1D
zigzag chain in a share-apex mode (Fig. 5). In the octa-
hedral geometry, the axial bonds of the Cu2? ions were
weakened by the Jahn–Teller distortion. Therefore, the two
axial Cu–O bond lengths (2.329 and 2.406 A˚ ) are clearly
longer than the four equatorial Cu–O and Cu–N bond
lengths in the range from 1.937 to 2.027 A˚ (Table 6).
The coordinationgeometry aroundCo inthe [Co(H2O)6]2?
cation is also a distorted octahedron. The six Co–O bond
lengths were 2.053(3), 2.088(2), 2.065(3), 2.085(3), 2.090(3),
and 2.044(3) A˚ , respectively. An investigation of the crystal
structure database (CSD) revealed that in the [Cu(H2O)6]2?
cation, four of the Cu–O bond lengths are short (*1.97 A˚ )
and two Cu–O bond lengths are long (*2.34 A˚ ); the M–O
bond lengths of the hexahydrated cation in complex 4 indicate
that the [M(H2O)6]2? cation is [Co(H2O)6]2? rather than
[Cu(H2O)6]2?. The result indicates that the Co2? ions of
Co(nta)Cl- unit in complex 1 have been replaced by Cu2?
ions, forming the Cu(nta)- anion and [Co(H2O)6]2? cation in
complex 4.

The structural difference in complex 3 and 4 may be
caused by the difference in ion radius and maximum
coordination number between barium and cobalt cations.
With larger ion radius, the barium ions have a maximum
coordination number of ten, which makes it be coordinated
by the carboxyl O atoms from nta ligands besides the water
molecules. On the other hand, with a much smaller ion
radius, the cobalt ions have a maximum coordination
number of six which makes it be coordinated by six water
molecules and forming a stable coordination octahedron.
As a result, the cobalt ions were not coordinated by the
carboxyl O atoms from nta ligands, which make it to be
presented as isolated hydrated ions.
The coordinated H2O O atom (O91) is H-bonded to
two
adjacent
H2O
molecules
[O(91)–H(91A)O(97),
2.753(5) A˚ and O(91)–H(91B)O(98), 2.687(4)A˚ ], which
are further H-bonded to two nta ligands. Another H2O
molecule (O95), which is H-bonded to O98 [O(95)–
H(95B)O(98), 2.771(4) A˚ ], also formed a H-bond with
two other nta ligands. Four parallel [Cu2(nta)2]n
2n-1D chains
were linked together by [Co(H2O)6]2? through H bonds,
forming a quasi-3D structure. The H2O molecules played
important roles in the integrity of this structure because they
were present in the structures of K[Co(C6H6NO6)(H2O)]
2H2O [27] and K[Cu(C6H6NO6)(H2O)]2H2O [28]. The
molecular structure of complex 5 was similar to that of 4
and is shown in the Supplementary Information (Figure S3).
3.4 Description of Thermal Stability
To examine the thermal stability of the title complexes,
thermogravimetric analysis (TG) were carried out in the
range of 20–800 C (Fig. 6). For complex 1, the ﬁrst
weight loss of 11.2 % from 60 to 110 C (peak: 110 C)
corresponds to the loss of three coordinated water mole-
cules of Ba2? ion (calculated, 11.4 %). The remaining
substance does not lose weight below 400 C (peaks:

440 C), after that the nitrilotriacetic acid ligand began to
decompose. Finally, BaCO3CoCO3 was obtained (residual
mass: observed, 64.3 %; calcd 65.6 %). The TG result of
complex 3 was similar to that of complex 1.
For complex 4, the ﬁrst weight loss of 15.8 % from 80 to
165 C (peak: 160 C) corresponds to the loss of six
coordinated water molecules of Co2? ion (calculated:
15.3 %).
In
190–420 C
region
(peak:
380 C),
the
nitrilotriacetic acid ligands began to decompose when the
temperature raise up. Finally, CuCO3CoCO3 was obtained
(residual mass: observed, 34.9 %; calcd, 34.1 %). The TG
results complex 5 was similar to that of complex 4.
Through thermal decomposition of mixed-metal nitri-
lotriacetate
coordination
polymers,
BaCO3CoCO3,
CuCO3CoCO3 or CuCO3NiCO3 were obtained. The TG
results here proposed a method for the preparation of
binary mixed-metal carbonate.
4 Conclusions
Mixed-metal nitrilotriacetate coordination polymers, M–
Cu(nta), were synthesized. The cations exhibited template
effect on the structure of the anions, Cu(nta)-.
1.
When the cation was Ba2?, the Cu2? ions were ﬁve-
coordinated with trigonal bipyramid geometry. The
hydrated Ba2? ions formed 1D zigzag chains, and the
chains were connected by the Cu(nta)- ions to form a
3D network.
2.
When the cations were Co2? or Ni2?, the Cu2? ions
were six-coordinated with octahedron geometry, and
Cu(nta)- ions were linked to a 1D zigzag chain. The
[Co(H2O)6]2? (or [Ni(H2O)6]2?) cations were present
as isolated units.
The results here indicate that the radius and maximum
coordination number of cations are important factor for the
structure of coordination polymers. Our research work may
give some insight into the design of coordination polymers
and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs).
