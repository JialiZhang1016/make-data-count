ABSTRACT Heat-shock protein (Hsp) 90 assists in the folding of diverse sets of client proteins including kinases and growth hormone
receptors. Hsp70 plays a major role in many Hsp90 functions by interacting and modulating conformation of its substrates before being
transferred to Hsp90s for ﬁnal maturation. Each eukaryote contains multiple members of the Hsp70 family. However, the role of
different Hsp70 isoforms in Hsp90 chaperoning actions remains unknown. Using v-Src as an Hsp90 substrate, we examined the role of
each of the four yeast cytosolic Ssa Hsp70s in regulating Hsp90 functions. We show that the strain expressing stress-inducible Ssa3 or
Ssa4, and the not constitutively expressed Ssa1 or Ssa2, as the sole Ssa Hsp70 isoform reduces v-Src-mediated growth defects. The
study shows that although different Hsp70 isoforms interact similarly with Hsp90s, v-Src maturation is less efﬁcient in strains expressing
Ssa4 as the sole Hsp70. We further show that the functional distinction between Ssa2 and Ssa4 is regulated by its C-terminal domain.
Further studies reveal that Ydj1, which is known to assist substrate transfer to Hsp70s, interacts relatively weakly with Ssa4 compared
with Ssa2, which could be the basis for poor maturation of the Hsp90 client in cells expressing stress-inducible Ssa4 as the sole Ssa
Hsp70. The study thus reveals a novel role of Ydj1 in determining the functional distinction among Hsp70 isoforms with respect to the
Hsp90 chaperoning action.

H
EAT-SHOCK protein (Hsp) 90 is a highly conserved
chaperone across all eukaryotes (Chen et al. 2006).
Vertebrates and lower eukaryotes contain multiple highly
homologous cytosolic Hsp90 isoforms with only partial
functional redundancy (Voss et al. 2000; Li et al. 2012).
Hsp90 is involved in the folding of various key cellular pro-
teins and is thus essential for cellular survival in eukaryotes.
Its client proteins include transcription factors, kinases, telo-
merase, and many viral proteins (Rajapandi et al. 2000; Citri
et al. 2006; Kim et al. 2008; Srisutthisamphan et al. 2018).
Several Hsp90 clients also include those involved in carci-
nogenesis such as p53, and thus the chaperone has been
extensively studied for its role in cancer biology (Boysen
et al. 2019; Dahiya et al. 2019). Although Hsp90 inﬂuences
the maturation of large numbers of cellular proteins, the
requirements vary with the substrates. For some sub-
strates, such as steroid hormone receptors, it is essential
for both maturation and maintenance, and for others such
as kinases, the chaperone is required only during the syn-
thesis and folding into the native state (Picard et al. 1990;
Xu et al. 1999). The diversity of Hsp90 functions is believed
to be due to its interaction with various cochaperones. In
spite of extensive research, no sequence or structural motif
conserved across different client proteins has been identi-
ﬁed, and thus how Hsp90 binds and assists in the folding of
diverse sets of substrates continues to be under intense
investigation (Taipale et al. 2012).
Hsp90 is a homodimeric protein and each protomer con-
sists of three domains, namely, the N-terminal domain that
binds to ATP, the client-binding middle domain that also
interacts with other cochaperones, and the MEEVD motif,
which contains C-terminal domains required for dimerization

and interaction with tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains
containing cochaperones (Minami et al. 1994; Prodromou
et al. 1999; Li et al. 2012). The client proteins are known to
interact with both the middle and the N-terminal domains of
Hsp90 (Sato et al. 2000; Karagöz et al. 2014). ATP binding to
the N-terminal domain leads to conformational changes in
Hsp90 (Graf et al. 2009); through an intermediary stage, the
chaperone forms a closed state in which the N-terminal do-
main is dimerized. In this structurally compact state, the ATP is
hydrolyzed, which leads to dissociation of the N-terminal do-
mains and the release of ADP followed by a transition of Hsp90
back to the original open conformation. The Hsp90 reaction
cycles are regulated by dynamic associations with various
cochaperones, which are broadly divided into TPR and non-
TPR-containing proteins such as Sti1, Cpr7, and Aha1 (Chang
et al. 1997; Mayr et al. 2000; Panaretou et al. 2002).
Hsp70 is one of the other major cellular chaperones that
playsacentralrole inmaturationofHsp90clientproteins such
as transcription factors and protein kinases (Kirschke et al.
2014; Roy et al. 2015). Hsp70 has its own chaperoning ac-
tivity and its role in the Hsp90 reaction cycle is for the early
folding of Hsp90 client proteins. Any defect in the Hsp70-
Hsp90 folding cycle results in ubiquitination and degradation
of Hsp90 client proteins (Leu et al. 2011; Rodina et al. 2013;
Roy et al. 2015). Hsp70 interacts with Hsp90 through an
adaptor molecule (e.g., Sti1 and Hop in yeast and mammals,
respectively) that acts as a bridge between the two chaper-
ones. Sti1 bridges the two chaperones via its helical TPR
domains that bind to the C-terminal EEVD motif present in
Hsp70 and Hsp90 (Schmid et al. 2012; Röhl et al. 2015). In
addition to being bridged by the adaptor molecules, the two
proteins also exhibit direct interactions (Kravats et al. 2018).
The substrate ﬁrst interacts with Hsp70 and the partially folded
substrate is then transferred to Hsp90 for further maturation.
The Hsp90 cycle progresses by its interaction with other
cochaperones such as peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerases
(Duina et al. 1996; Warth et al. 1997) and Sba1 (e.g., homol-
ogous to mammalian p23) (Sullivan et al. 2002; McLaughlin
et al. 2006), followed by dissociation of Hsp90 from the
Hsp70-Hsp90 complex. The exact role of Hsp70 in regulating
Hsp90 functions is not clearly understood. It is believed that
the role of Hsp70 in the Hsp90 chaperone machinery is to
stabilize protein substrates in a conﬁguration that can be
recognized and bound by Hsp90 (Karagöz et al. 2014).
Eukaryotes contain multiple, highly homologous members
of cytosolic Hsp70, e.g., the genetically tractable Saccharomyces
cerevisiae harbors four cytosolic SSA (Stress-Seventy subfamily
A) Hsp70 isoforms (Ssa1–4) (Werner-Washburne et al. 1987).
Ssa1 and Ssa2 are constitutively expressed, whereas Ssa3 and
Ssa4 are expressed only under stress conditions such as high
temperature and oxidative stress (Werner-Washburne et al.
1989). Previous studies have shown that although they are
highly homologous, the Ssa isoforms possess both redundant
as well as distinct functions (Lotz et al. 2019). It has been shown
that cells expressing Ssa2 but not Ssa1 stably propagate one of
the yeast prions (URE3) (Tibor Roberts et al. 2004). It has been
similarly shown that the presence of Ssa3 under heat-shock
conditions is required to suppress a-synuclein-mediated toxicity
(Flower et al. 2005; Gupta et al. 2018). Although various studies
have examined the roles of different Hsp70 isoforms in substrate
folding, not much is known about their signiﬁcance for Hsp90
functions. It is also not clear whether different members of the
Hsp70 family function similarly or distinctly in the Hsp90
chaperoning pathway. As Hsp70 is required for the Hsp90
chaperoning function, the differences in the actions of these
different Hsp70 isoforms could affect the fates of Hsp90 client
proteins.
In the present study, using v-Src as a model Hsp90 client
protein, we have investigated the roles of different Ssa Hsp70s
in the Hsp90 chaperoning pathway. Our results show that
although Ssa1 and Ssa2 stabilize v-Src, its maturation is
inhibited in strains expressing Ssa3 or Ssa4 as the sole source
of Ssa Hsp70. We show that different Ssa Hsp70 isoforms
interact similarly with Hsp90 and that their distinct role in
the Hsp90 pathway is due to their different afﬁnities with
Hsp40 Ydj1. The present study thus reveals that Ydj1 is re-
quired not only to stimulate the activities of Hsp90s, but also
in deﬁning their functional speciﬁcity in Hsp90 chaperoning
activity.
Materials and Methods
Strains and plasmids
The strains and plasmids used in the study are described in
Table 1 and Table 2, respectively.
Plasmid pRS316PGAL1-GFP is a URA3-based single-copy
vector with GFP under a GAL1 promoter. For protein puriﬁ-
cation, HSP82 and STI1 were subcloned into the pET29bHTV
plasmid using PCR-based ampliﬁcation of the respective
genes, and further digestion using BamH1 and Xho1 to gen-
erate pET29bHTV-HSP82 and pET29bHTV-STI. The plasmid
encodes (in the 59 to 39 direction) a Hexa-His-tag, a TEV
protease recognition site, and HSP82 or STI1.
Media and growth conditions
Media composition is as described before (Kumar et al. 2014).
Synthetic-deﬁned (SD) media is composed of yeast nitrogen
base (233520; BD) with ammonium sulfate (0.67%) and 2%
dextrose (50-99-7; Fisher Scientiﬁc). SGal media is similar to
SD media, except it is supplemented with 2% rafﬁnose
(R0250; Sigma [Sigma Chemical], St. Louis, MO) and 2%
galactose (G0625; Sigma) instead of dextrose. YPAD media
is composed of 1% yeast extract (212750; BD), 2% peptone
(244620; BD), and 2% dextrose supplemented with 0.005%
adenine (A9126; Sigma). Cells were grown at 30 unless specif-
ically mentioned. Amino acids were supplemented as required.
Immunoblot analysis
Cells grown in liquid media were harvested by centrifugation,
and lysed using glass beads. The lysate was further fraction-
ated into supernatant and pellet. The proteins were separated

bySDS-PAGE,transferredontoPVDFmembranes,andprobed
using the desired antibodies. The primary antibodies used in
the study were as follows: anti-FLAG (F3165; Sigma), anti-
phosphotyrosine (05-321; Millipore, Bedford, MA), Anti-GFP
(MA5-15256; Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc), anti-Sse1 (a kind
gift from J. Brodsky), anti-Ydj1 (SAB5200007; Sigma), anti-
Hsc82 (ab30920; Abcam), anti-Hsp70 (ADI-SPA-822-F; Enzo
Lifesciences), and anti-Pgk1 (catalog number 459250; Invi-
trogen, Carlsbad, CA). Primary antibodies were used at di-
lution of 1:5000 and incubated with an immunoblot for 1 hr
at 25. Lysate for A4 was loaded at three times the amount of
A2 lysate to correct for the lower v-Src level in A4 strain, and
also for the lower anti-Hsp70 antibody afﬁnity for Ssa4 than
Ssa2. Densitometric analysis of immunoblots was performed
using UN-SCAN-IT software.
Chase experiments
Yeast strains were grown in selective liquid SD media at 30
until OD600nm reached 0.8–1. Cells were collected using cen-
trifugation and washed three times with sterile water. The
v-Src expression was induced by diluting cells into selective
liquid SGal media to 0.5 OD600nm. Cells were further grown
for 12 hr at 30. Galactose-mediated protein expression was
terminated by shifting cells to growth media containing dex-
trose instead of galactose. To monitor v-Src degradation, the
culture aliquots were collected at the mentioned time points.
Cells were harvested and lysed using mechanical disruption.
The cellular lysates were probed on an immunoblot using
anti-FLAG antibody (F3165; Sigma).
Protein puriﬁcation
Ydj1 was puriﬁed as described earlier (Sharma and Masison
2011).
For Hsp82 and Sti1 puriﬁcation, plasmids pET29bHTV-
HSP82 and pET29bHTV-STI1 were transformed in Escherichia
coli Rosetta DE3 (Invitrogen) strains. Cultures were grown
in LB broth until OD600nm reached 0.7 and protein expression
was induced with 0.3 mM IPTG at 37 for 3 hr. Cells were
lysed, and His6-tagged Hsp82 was puriﬁed from cellular ly-
sates through cobalt-based Talon metal afﬁnity resin. To
remove the His6-tag, puriﬁed His6-Hsp82 was incubated with
His6-TEV (Tobacco etch virus). The cleaved His6-tag, along
with the TEV protease recognition site and His6-TEV protease,
was further removed using a metal afﬁnity column.
Sti1 was puriﬁed using a process similar to that described
above for Hsp82.
Ssa2 and Ssa4 were puriﬁed using a process similar to
that described for Ssa2 (Gupta et al. 2018). Brieﬂy, strains
harboring plasmid pRS416PGPD-His6SSA2 or pRS416PGPD-
His6SSA4 as a sole source of Ssa Hsp70 were grown in liquid
YPAD media for 24 hr at 30. Cells were harvested and resus-
pended in 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM KCl, and
20 mM MgCl2 pH 7.4 buffer (buffer A) containing protease
inhibitor cocktail (Pierce Chemical, Rockford, IL). Cell lysis
was carried out using glass beads followed by sonication.
Protein puriﬁcation was carried out using cobalt-based metal
afﬁnity resin. The N-terminal His6 tag was removed using
TEV protease as described above for Hsp82. The His6 tag
cleaved puriﬁed protein was further incubated with ATP-agarose
resin for 4 hr and eluted with buffer A containing 7 mM
ATP and 1 mM DTT (Gupta et al. 2018). Protein purity was
conﬁrmed on 10% SDS-PAGE.
The hybrid proteins Ssa24 and Ssa42 were puriﬁed using a
process similar to that described above for Ssa2.
Immunoprecipitation and pull down
For immunoprecipitation studies, cells were resuspended in
20 mM Tris pH 7.5 buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM
EDTA, and 1 mM PMSF, and lysed by mechanical disruption
using glass beads. The lysate was incubated overnight with
anti-FLAG antibody-attached resin (A220; Sigma). The un-
bound fraction in the supernatant was removed by centrifu-
gation at 4000 3 g for 1 min. The beads were washed with
buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and
20 mM Tris pH 7.5, and immunoprecipitated proteins were
further analyzed on immunoblots using various antibodies.
The pull-down studies were performed as described earlier
(Kumar et al. 2015). Brieﬂy, puriﬁed His6-Ydj1 or His6-Hsp82
was bound to cobalt-based afﬁnity resin, followed by incuba-
tion with yeast lysate. The resin was further washed to
remove unbound proteins. The bound fraction was eluted
using 20 mM EDTA and probed with the desired antibodies.
Quantitative real-time PCR
The cells were harvested and total RNA was puriﬁed using a
HiPurA Yeast RNA Puriﬁcation Kit (MB611 from HiMedia)
following the manufacturer’s protocol. About 100 ng of iso-
lated RNA was used to prepare complementary DNA (cDNA)

using a cDNA synthesis kit (Verso from AB1453B; Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc). Then, 50 ng of cDNA was used as template
for quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) using a DyNAmo-
ColorFlash SYBR green PCR kit (FNZ416L; Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc) on the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Ap-
plied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
Luciferase refolding assay
The luciferase refolding assay was carried following a procedure
similar to that described previously (Kravats et al. 2018), with a
few modiﬁcations. Brieﬂy ﬁreﬂy luciferase (80 nM) from Prom-
ega (Madison, WI) was denatured in the presence of 1 mM ATP
at 45 for 10 min. The denatured luciferase (40 nM) was
refolded in the presence of 0.3 mM Ydj1 with or without
0.5 mM Hsp70 (Ssa2 or Ssa4). The reaction was incubated at
25 and refolding was initiated by the addition of 1 mM ATP.
Refolding was measured as an increase in luminescence with
time. To examine the effect of Hsp90 on luciferase refolding,
denatured luciferase (40 nM) was incubated in the presence of
0.3 mM Ydj1, 0.5 mM Hsp70 (Ssa2 or Ssa4), 2.4 mM Sti1, and
0.9 mM Hsp82, and the refolding was monitored as stated above.
Ste11 kinase assay
Yeast cells were transformed with plasmid pheromone re-
sponse element (PRE)-lacZ with the lacZ gene driven by PREs
(Morano and Thiele 1999). The cells were grown until
OD600nm reached 1 and further treated with a-factor
(5 mM) for 6 hr. The b-galactosidase activity was measured
as described before (Morano and Thiele 1999). Brieﬂy,
OD600nm 1 cells were permeabilized using the freeze–thaw
method. The cells were incubated with 200 ml of ONPG
(o-nitrophenyl-b-D-galactopyranoside) (4 mg/ml) for 15 min
followed by the addition of 1 M Na2CO3. The cells were
separated using centrifugation, and the supernatant was
used for measuring absorbance at 420 nm.
Biolayer interferometry
Biolayer interferometry studies were performed using an
Octet K2 instrument (ForteBio) to monitor the interaction
between Ydj1 with different Hsp70 isoforms at 30. Ydj1 was
immobilized on amine-reactive second-generation (AR2G)
biosensors, activated using a 1:1 ratio of 0.1 M N-hydroxy-
succinimide and 0.4 M 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-
carbodiimide, to a response signal of 1 nm. Postimmobiliza-
tion, the biosensor was blocked with 1 M ethanolamine. The
reference biosensor was activated similarly except that assay
buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM MgCl2,
and 20 mM KCl) lacking Ydj1 was used for immobilization on
AR2G biosensors. The immobilized Ydj1 and reference bio-
sensors were dipped into assay buffer containing increasing
concentrations (0.25–1 mM) of Ssa Hsp70 isoforms in a
96-well plate, and binding was monitored as an increase in
binding response for 200 sec. Dissociation was monitored in
buffer alone for 200 sec. The nonspeciﬁc signal obtained from
reference biosensor was subtracted from the corresponding
response signal of Ydj1 and Hsp70 interaction. The obtained
binding sensograms were analyzed using software “Data
Analysis 9.0” available from ForteBio.
Signiﬁcance test
Three biological replicates were performed for each experi-
ment. To compare signiﬁcance among the groups, the Stu-
dent’s t-test was used. P-values are shown as follows: *P ,
0.05, **P , 0.01, and ***P , 0.001, with P , 0.05 consid-
ered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
Hsp90 chaperoning action varies with its partner Ssa
Hsp70 isoforms
The oncogene v-Src of the Rous sarcoma virus is one of the
most well-studied Hsp90 clients in the yeast S. cerevisiae.
Although S. cerevisiae does not encode for v-Src kinase, its
heterologous expression and subsequent maturation leads to
tyrosine phosphorylation of many cellular proteins (Brugge
et al. 1987). The uncontrolled phosphorylation activity in-
duces cellular growth arrest in the yeast. The poor growth
of the yeast cells upon v-Src overexpression is thus indicative
of native folding and maturation of the kinase to its active
form. We ﬁrst conﬁrmed v-Src-mediated cellular growth ar-
rest in a wild-type strain encoding all four cytosolic Ssa
Hsp70 isoforms (Supplemental Material, Figure S1). To ex-
amine the role of different Ssa Hsp70 isoforms in Hsp90
chaperoning functions, we overexpressed v-Src from a galac-
tose-inducible promoter in yeast strains that express only one
of the desired isoforms in the absence of all four chromoso-
mally encoded Hsp70s. To achieve similar expression levels
of the expressed Ssa Hsp70s, all isoforms are expressed under

the same native constitutive Ssa2 promoter. Figure 1 shows
the growth phenotypes of cells harboring either empty plas-
mid or plasmid-encoding v-Src under a galactose-inducible
promoter. In the absence of v-Src expression, all strains
expressing individual Ssa Hsp70 isoforms grew similarly (Fig-
ure 1, A and C). The v-Src overexpression in strains express-
ing Ssa1 (A1) or Ssa2 (A2) as the sole source of Hsp70 led to
growth defects, as is evident from their poor growth onto
SGal solid media. Interestingly, cells overexpressing v-Src
with Ssa3 (A3) or Ssa4 (A4) as the sole Ssa Hsp70 grew
better than A1 or A2. The v-Src-mediated growth defects
were further examined using spot dilution assays onto solid
growth media (Figure 1C). As observed for the primary trans-
formants, the A1 and A2 strains showed higher v-Src-mediated
toxicity than strains expressing stress-inducible Ssa Hsp70s.
Similar results were obtained when A1–A4 strains expressing
v-Src were grown at 30 for 72 hr in liquid SD media or with
galactose (SGal) as the carbon source (Figure 1D). As the A1–
A4 strains are isogenic except for the presence of different Ssa
Hsp70 isoforms, the data suggest that stress-inducible Ssa
Hsp70s function differently than the constitutive isoforms in
promoting the maturation of Hsp90 substrate v-Src.
To examine whether the distinct effect of stress-inducible
Hsp70s is speciﬁc to v-Src or is more general for other Hsp90
clients, we further explored the maturation of an another
Hsp90 client, Ste11, in the A2 and A4 strains. The Ste11
kinase is required for the activation of Ste12, which regulates
PREs. Ste11 maturation can thus be widely monitored by the
activity of b-galactosidase expressed under the control of a
PRE. The plasmid encoding PRE-lacZ was transformed into
the A2 or A4 strains. The transformants were grown on liquid
SD media until OD600nm reached 1 and were treated
with a-factor for the induction of Ste11 expression. Next,
b-galactosidase activity was monitored as described in the
Materials and Methods section. Compared with A2, the
b-galactosidase activity was found to be lower in the A4 cells
(Figure S2). These results suggest that, similar to v-Src, Ste11
maturation is also reduced in A4 cells.
The reduction in v-Src toxicity is due to faster
degradation of v- Src
The above results show that strains with stress-inducible Ssa3
or Ssa4 as the sole Hsp70 reduce v-Src-mediated toxicity.
Furthermore, a comparison of the growth phenotypes of A3
vs. A4 cells shows that v-Src overexpression is less detrimen-
tal in cells expressing Ssa4 than in those expressing Ssa3. To
further explore the mechanism of reduced v-Src toxicity, we
used A2 and A4 as representative members of constitutive
and stress-inducible Hsp70 chaperones. v-Src kinase requires
Hsp90 chaperone machinery to fold it to the native state, and
if folding fails the kinase is targeted for degradation (An et al.
2000; Kundrat and Regan 2010). Thus, we examined v-Src
abundances in the A2 and A4 strains to explore whether v-Src
toxicity in the A4 strain is reduced due to a defect in its
maturation. The cells expressing FLAG-tagged v-Src from a
galactose-inducible promoter were grown in liquid growth
media containing galactose for 12 hr and the cellular lysate
was then fractionated onto 12% SDS-PAGE before probing
with the anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Figure 2A, the v-Src
expression was 2–2.5-fold lower in A4 than in the A2 strain.
Figure 1 Strains expressing Ssa3 or Ssa4 showed
reduction in v-Src toxicity. (A) S. cerevisiae strains
A1–A4 were transformed with pRS316 (EV) or

To examine whether the relatively reduced abundance of
v-Src in the A4 strain is due to an effect of the galactose-
inducible promoter, GFP was used as a reporter gene to
monitor the strength of the GAL1 promoter in the A1–A4
strains. The gene encoding GFP was subcloned under the
GAL1 promoter, and its expression was monitored using im-
munoblot analysis with anti-GFP antibodies and with ﬂuores-
cence microscopy. Both the immunoblot analysis with the
anti-GFP antibody (Figure S3A) and ﬂuorescence microscopy
(Figure S3B) showed that the GFP levels were similar in the
A1–A4 strains, thus suggesting that the galactose promoter’s
strength remains independent of variations in the Hsp70
isoforms.
We further examined the degradation rates of v-Src in cells
expressing Ssa2 orSsa4 as thesole Ssa Hsp70 source. The cells
were grown under inducible conditions for 12 hr and were
then shifted to repressible media to suppress v-Src expression.
The abundances of preformed v-Src were then monitored at
different time intervals (Figure 2B). As was observed, al-
though even after 30 min of chase, there was no signiﬁcant
change in the v-Src levels in the A2 cells and .60% of v-Src
was found to be degraded in the A4 cells. After 90 min of
growth in repressible media, most of the preformed v-Src was
degraded in the A4 cells whereas .50% of the v-Src was still
present in the A2 cells. The enhanced degradation in the A4
strain was speciﬁc to v-Src as both GFP and other cellular
proteins showed similar abundances in the A2 and A4 strains
(Figure S4). Collectively, the above data suggest that v-Src
degradation rates are higher in the A4 strain than in the A2
strain.
The constitutively active mature v-Src randomly phosphor-
ylates most of the tyrosine-containing proteins of the yeast
proteome (Brugge et al. 1987). To examine the tyrosine ki-
nase activity of v-Src, cells harboring a v-Src expression plas-
mid were grown in inducible growth media. The cells were
then lysed and the lysate was immunoblotted with an anti-
phosphotyrosine antibody. As expected, most of cellular pro-
teins were detected with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody
(Figure 2C,) but the phosphorylation levels varied between
the A2 and A4 strains. Overall, the band intensity, which is a
reﬂection of v-Src kinase activity, was found to be higher in
the lysate obtained from the A2 cells than that obtained from
the A4 cells, thus suggesting relatively higher v-Src matura-
tion levels in cells expressing Ssa2 than those expressing Ssa4
as the sole Ssa Hsp70 source. Thus, the v-Src kinase activities
in the A2 and A4 cells paralleled the growth defects observed
in these strains. Overall, these results show that v-Src matu-
ration is signiﬁcantly reduced in strains expressing Ssa4

dance of major chaperones. Yeast lysate was pre-

Hsp70 as the partner Hsp90 protein; these results indicate
that different Hsp70 isoforms function differently in the
Hsp90 chaperoning pathway.
The A2 and A4 strains expressing v-Src show similar
abundances of other major chaperones
To explore whether the observed differences in v-Src matu-
ration are related to altered abundances of the major heat-
shock proteins involved in client protein maturation, we
examined the expression levels of Hsp70, Ydj1, Sse1,
Hsp104, and Hsp90 in both the A2 and A4 strains. Both
Ydj1 and Sse1 are known to affect v-Src maturation, suggest-
ing that both cochaperones play important roles in Hsp90-
dependent functions (Dey et al. 1996; Goeckeler et al. 2002).
Similarly, Hsp104 is known to interact with Hsp90 cochaper-
ones as well as with Hsp70 (Abbas-Terki et al. 2001; Reidy
and Masison 2010).
WeﬁrstexaminedtheSsa2andSsa4levelsintheA2andA4
strains, respectively. Since the Hsp70 antibody recognizes
Ssa2 with three times higher afﬁnity than Ssa4 (Gupta
et al. 2018), the cellular abundances of the Ssa Hsp70 iso-
forms were measured by normalizing the amount of Hsp70
detected in the whole-cell lysate with respect to that ob-
served using in vitro puriﬁed Hsp70s (Figure 3A). In agree-
ment with our previous study, similar Ssa2 and Ssa4 levels
were observed from the A2 and A4 strains, respectively, sug-
gesting that the variations in kinase maturation are not due to
varying Hsp70s levels.
To monitor Ydj1 abundance, the cellular lysates from the
A2 and A4 cells were normalized for the total protein amount,
and were further probed on an immunoblot with antibodies
against Ydj1 (Figure 3B). As seen in Figure 3B, Ydj1 was
found to be similar in both the A2 and A4 strains. As v-Src
is an Hsp90 substrate, we further examined Hsp90 abun-
dances similar to those described above for Ydj1. We ﬁrst
examined the speciﬁcity of the anti-Hsp90 antibody for either
of the two Hsp90 isoforms, namely, Hsc82 and Hsp82. As
shown in Figure S5, the antibody detects both of the Hsp90
isoforms. The immunoblot results with the anti-Hsp90 anti-
bodies showed that Hsp90 is expressed similarly in both the
A2 and A4 strains (Figure 3B). Similarly, no signiﬁcant dif-
ferences were observed for Hsp104 and Sse1 in the A4 strain
vs. the A2 strain. These results generally suggest that de-
creased v-Src toxicity in the A4 strain is not related to altered
levels of the major heat-shock proteins.
v-Src interaction with Ssa4 is lower than with Ssa2
The reduced tyrosine phosphorylation activity and associated
toxicity of v-Src in the A4 strain indicates a defect in its
maturation to a native folded state. As v-Src is an Hsp90
substrate and this interaction facilitates v-Src maturation,
we conducted immunoprecipitation assays to examine the
v-Src interactions with Hsp90 in both the A2 and A4 strains.
Cells expressing FLAG-v-Src were grown for 12 hr and the
cellular lysates were incubated with immobilized beads of
anti-FLAG antibodies. As the v-Src steady-state level is lower
in A4 cells, for immunoprecipitation studies greater quantities
of cellular lysates from A4 cells (3x) were incubated with
beads coated with anti-FLAG antibodies to capture equal
amounts of v-Src from the A2 and A4 strains. The similar
levels of immobilized v-Src were conﬁrmed on animmunoblot
with an anti-FLAG antibody (Figure 4, upper panel). The
co-immunoprecipitated proteins were further probed with
the anti-Hsp90 antibody. As shown in Figure 4, although sim-
ilar levels of v-Src were detected, more Hsp90 was obtained
from A2 than from the A4 strain, thus suggesting that less of
the v-Src interacts with Hsp90 in the A4 strain.
It is well known that many Hsp90 substrates ﬁrst interact
with Hsp70 before being transferred to Hsp90 (Arlander et al.
2006; Cintron and Toft 2006). To explore whether reduced
levels of the v-Src-Hsp90 complex in the A4 strain were due
to altered upstream interactions of v-Src with Hsp70s, we
examined its interactions with Ssa2 and Ssa4. Similar to that
described above for Hsp90, the co-immunoprecipitated pro-
teins with FLAG-v-Src were further probed with anti-Hsp70
antibodies. As seen for Hsp90, although both Ssa2 and Ssa4

were detected at similar levels in the cellular lysates, less
Ssa4 was found in the co-immunoprecipitated protein sample
(Figure 4). These results suggest that although Ssa2 or Ssa4
are highly homologous, their binding properties with v-Src
differ signiﬁcantly in vivo.
Both the Ssa2 and Ssa4 isoforms interact similarly
with Hsp90
We further examined the ability of Ssa2 and Ssa4 to interact
with Hsp90. His6-Hsp82 was used as the immobilized bait for
the Hsp70s present in the cellular lysates from the A2 and A4
strains. Equal amounts of puriﬁed hexa-His-tagged Hsp82
(His6-Hsp82) were bound over a cobalt-based metal afﬁnity
resin. The cellular lysates obtained from the A2 and A4 cells
expressing FLAG-v-Src were passed through His6-Hsp82-
bound beads. The beads were subsequently washed and the
bound proteins were eluted using 20 mM EDTA. The eluted
proteins were then immunoblotted with anti-Hsp70, anti-
Hsp90, and anti-FLAG tag antibodies. The eluted fractions
from the A2 and A4 cellular lysates, when probed with the
anti-Hsp70 antibody, showed similar levels of Hsp70s, thus
suggesting that the two Hsp70 isoforms bind with similar
afﬁnities to Hsp90 (Figure 5). Furthermore, lower amounts
of v-Src were found in the eluted fraction from A4 than in the
eluted fraction with A2 cells; this result is in agreement with
the above data and shows that v-Src binds with lower afﬁnity
to Hsp90 in A4 (Figure 5). Overall, the above data show that
both A2 and A4 bind with similar afﬁnity to Hsp90 and A4
cells, but that less of the v-Src interacts with Hsp90, which
could be due its relatively poor interaction with Ssa4 com-
pared with that with Ssa2.
Ydj1 interacts poorly with Ssa4 compared with Ssa2
AsYdj1isknowntoplayanimportantroleinsubstratetransfer
to Hsp70s (Dey et al. 1996), we next explored the ability of
v-Src to interact with Ydj1 in A2 and A4 cells expressing
FLAG-tagged v-Src. The interactions were examined using a
pull-down assay with Ydj1 as the bait protein and the bound
fractions were probed with anti-FLAG antibodies. As shown
in Figure 6A, roughly similar amounts of v-Src were detected
in the A2 and A4 strains, suggesting that Ydj1 binds with
similar afﬁnity to v-Src from either the A2 or A4 strain.
We next determined the interactions between Ydj1 and
Ssa2 or Ssa4 using methods similar to those mentioned above
for its interaction with v-Src. The eluted fractions from Ydj1-
bound beads were probed with anti-Hsp70 or anti-Hsp90
antibodies. Figure 6A shows that compared with Ssa2, signif-
icantly lower amounts of Ssa4 were detected in the eluted
fraction, thus suggesting that Ydj1 binds with relatively weaker
afﬁnity to Ssa4 than to Ssa2. Interestingly, Hsp90 from the A2
and A4 cells was found to interact similarly with Ydj1.
To further examine the Ydj1 interactions with the Ssa
Hsp70 isoforms, we conducted biolayer interferometry stud-
ies with puriﬁed chaperones as described in the Materials and
Methods section. Biolayer interferometry is an optical label-
free method that is extensively used to monitor biomolecular
interactions in real time. The Ydj1-loaded biosensor tips were
immersed in solutions containing ATP (5 mM) and with in-
creasing concentrations of one of the Hsp70 isoforms (Ssa2 or
Ssa4). Figure 6B shows the sensograms for the binding of
Ydj1 with the Ssa Hsp70 isoforms. As seen, incubation of
the Ydj1-coated biosensor tips with solutions containing
Ssa2 or Ssa4 led to increases in the biolayer interferometry
signals. The binding response increased with increasing con-
centrations of the Ssa Hsp70 isoforms. Furthermore, at sim-
ilar concentrations, the binding response was much stronger
for Ssa2 than for Ssa4, suggests that the Ydj1 binding afﬁnity
is higher for Ssa2 than for Ssa4, which is in agreement with
the above pull-down assays that showed relatively stronger
binding of Ydj1 with Ssa2.
Ydj1-assisted substrate refolding is more efﬁcient with
Ssa2 than with Ssa4
As Ydj1 assists Hsp70 in stimulating ATPase activity as well as
in substrate transfer, any variation in its interaction with Ssa2
vs. Ssa4 might affect the downstream maturation of Hsp70 or
Hsp90 substrates. Therefore, we further explored the Ydj1-
assisted refolding of thermally denatured luciferase, which is
a well-known Hsp70 substrate. Luciferase unfolds upon in-
cubation at higher temperatures and its refolding back to a

and Ssa4 isoforms of Hsp70. The puriﬁed His6-
Hsp82 was adsorbed onto cobalt metal afﬁnity resin
and further incubated with yeast lysate from A2 or
A4 strains expressing FLAG-v-Src. The bound frac-
tions were probed for Ssa Hsp70s, v-Src, or Hsp82
with anti-Hsp70 antibody, anti-FLAG antibody, or
anti-Hsp90 antibody, respectively. Panel toward right

native state requires the presence of Hsp70. This refolding is
further enhanced when Hsp90 is co-incubated with Hsp70s
in a refolding buffer.
Luciferase was denatured by incubation at 45 for 10 min.
Refolding was initiated by incubating denatured luciferase
with Ydj1 in both the presence and absence of Ssa2 or Ssa4
at 25 for different time intervals. As seen in Figure 7A, the
presence of Ydj1 alone in the refolding buffer was not able to
refold luciferase. As expected, the fraction of refolded lucif-
erase, as measured by the increase in luminescence, in-
creased when Ssa2 or Ssa4 was added into the refolding
buffer containing Ydj1. The refolding level increased with
increasing incubation time and saturated at 30 min. Al-
though luciferase refolded in the presence of either Ssa2 or
Ssa4, the fraction of refolding was found to be signiﬁcantly
greater for Ssa2 than for Ssa4 (Figure 7A). After 30 min of
incubation with Ssa2:Ydj1, the luciferase refolding level was
25-fold, compared with only 2.5-fold with Ssa4:Ydj1. Over-
all, the data suggest that the Ssa2:Ydj1 complex is more ef-
ﬁcient than Ssa4:Ydj1 for the refolding of denatured
luciferase. These results are in agreement with the above
pull-down assay, which showed weaker Ydj1 interaction with
Ssa4 than with Ssa2.
We next examined the effect of Hsp90 on the refolding of
denaturedluciferase.ThebridgeproteinSti1wasaddedtothe
refolding reaction containing either Ssa2 or Ssa4 isoforms and
Ydj1, and the refolding was monitored in both the presence
and absence of an Hsp82 isoform of Hsp90. As expected, the
addition of Hsp90 further enhanced luciferase refolding and
relatively more so in reactions containing Ssa2 rather than
Ssa4 (Figure 7B). After 30 min of incubation, the luciferase
refolding was 66-fold in the reaction containing Ssa2:Ydj1:
Sti1:Hsp82, compared with a level of only 16-fold with
Ssa4:Ydj1:Sti1:Hsp82. Overall, these studies suggest that
Ydj1:Ssa2:Hsp90 has higher refolding activity than
Ydj1:Ssa4:Hsp90.
The above results suggest that Ydj1 association with Ssa
Hsp70 is crucial for substrate refolding. To conﬁrm whether
Ydj1 is also crucial for the maturation of v-Src in vivo, we
examined wild-type and ydj1D strains for v-Src-mediated
growth defects. The cells were transformed with the plas-
mid-encoding FLAG-v-Src under a galactose-inducible pro-
moter and the transformants were further monitored for
growth onto media containing dextrose or galactose as
the carbon source. As shown in Figure S6, in the presence
of v-Src, cells lacking Ydj1 grew signiﬁcantly more than

expressing FLAG-tagged v-Src. The bound proteins were
probed with anti-FLAG, anti-Hsp70, anti-Hsp90, or anti-
Ydj1 antibody. Relatively higher amount of Hsp70 from
the A2 strain was detected indicating a stronger interac-
tion of Ydj1 with Ssa2 than Ssa4. Panel toward right

served at similar concentrations of the two Hsp70
isoforms. Inset shows the zoomed-in view of Ydj1 inter-
action with Ssa4. The labels are represented as the same

wild-type cells, thus suggesting the critical role of Ydj1 in
v-Src maturation.
The functional distinction between Ssa2 and Ssa4 is
governed by their C-terminal domains
Ydj1 interacts with Hsp70 at its ATPase, as well as the
C-terminal, domain (Gong et al. 2018). Although Ydj1 inter-
action with the ATPase domain is crucial for stimulating
Hsp70 ATPase activity, its coordination with the C-terminal
domain facilitates substrate transfer (Demand et al. 1998).
To examine the role of nucleotide-binding domain (NBD)
and C-terminal domain in determining the functional distinc-
tion of the Ssa Hsp70 isoforms, we swapped these domains
and constructed two hybrid proteins based upon Ssa2 and
Ssa4 as the parent proteins (Figure 8A). The hybrid Ssa24
encodes the NBD and SBD (substrate binding domain) of
Ssa2, and the C-terminal domain of Ssa4. Similarly, Ssa42
encodes the NBD and SBD of Ssa4, and the C-terminal do-
main of Ssa2. Strains expressing Ssa24 or Ssa42 (e.g., A24 or
A42, respectively) as the sole Ssa Hsp70 source were con-
structed and examined for v-Src toxicity. In the absence of
v-Src, the strains expressing the hybrid proteins showed sim-
ilar growth on liquid YPAD as well as on solid SD media, thus
suggesting that designed hybrid proteins are well folded and
functionally active (Figure 8, A and B). Furthermore, the
hybrid proteins were expressed at similar levels as those of
wild-type Ssa2 or Ssa4 (Figure S7). As seen before, the tox-
icity is reduced in the Ssa4 strain compared with Ssa2. For
strains expressing hybrid proteins, we found that the v-Src
overexpression was less toxic in strains expressing Ssa24 than
in those expressing Ssa42 (Figure 8B); this result suggests
that the C-terminal domain governs the functional distinction
between Ssa2 and Ssa4 for the activities required for matu-
ration of the Hsp90 client protein v-Src. The reduced toxicity
of the Ssa24 strain is not due to altered expression of other
chaperones such as Ydj1 and Hsp90, and suggests a direct
role of the hybrid chaperone in the maturation of v-Src kinase
(Figure S7). v-Src maturation was further conﬁrmed by mea-
suring its steady-state level in the Ssa24- and Ssa42-expressing
strains. As shown in Figure 8C, the v-Src levels were found
to be much lower in Ssa24 than in Ssa42; this result suggests
its higher degradation in Ssa24. To further explore whether
lower levels of v-Src in A4 and A24 are related to lower
amounts of v-Src transcription, we conducted qRT-PCR with
primers speciﬁc for v-Src. As shown in Figure 8D, no signif-
icant differences in v-Src messenger RNA levels were
observed in A4 and A24 compared with A2 and A42,
respectively.
We further measured the Ydj1 interactions with hybrid
Ssa24 and Ssa42 using a pull-down assay with His6-tagged
Ydj1 as the bait protein. His6-Ydj1 was bound over cobalt
metal afﬁnity beads, and the cellular lysates from the A24
and A42 cells were passed through the Ydj1-bound beads
(Figure S8). Similar to the results shown above, Ydj1 binds
with relatively higher afﬁnity to Ssa2 than to Ssa4. For the
hybrids, the Ydj1 interaction with Ssa24 is stronger than
with Ssa42, thus suggesting that the NBD plays a domi-
nant role in regulating Ydj1 interactions with Ssa Hsp70;
this is expected based on previous ﬁndings (Jiang et al.
2007).
Overall, these results point toward a role of the C-terminal
domain of the Hsp70 isoforms in determining the functional
distinction between Ssa2 and Ssa4 in the Hsp90 pathway.
Discussion
Hsp70 and Hsp90, along with their cochaperones, form two
major classes of cellular chaperone machinery. Hsp70-mediated
substrate refolding is independent of Hsp90 actions; how-
ever, Hsp90 requires Hsp70 for the maturation of many
of its client proteins. Therefore, insight into how Hsp70
coordinates with Hsp90 is critical to further enhance our
understanding of Hsp90 function. As eukaryotes carry multi-
ple cytosolic members of the Hsp70 family, the role of each of
these highly homologous members in Hsp90 activity is not
clear. Although the members of the Hsp70 or Hsp90 families
are very homologous within each family, they function dis-
tinctly in many cellular processes. The current study thus
dissects the role of each of the Hsp70 isoforms in the Hsp90
pathway and shows that different isoforms behave differently
with Hsp90s, and that the distinction is primarily governed by
the C-terminal domain of Hsp70s.
Figure 7 Ssa2 has higher luciferase refolding activ-
ity compared to Ssa4. (A) Luciferase was denatured
at 45, and refolded in the presence of Ssa2 or Ssa4
and Ydj1. As shown, fraction of luciferase that
refolded was higher in the presence of A2 than
A4. (B) The denatured luciferase (40 nM) was in-
cubated in the presence of 0.3 mM Ydj1, 0.5 mM
Hsp70 (Ssa2 or Ssa4), 2.4 mM Sti1, and 0.9 mM
Hsp82, and the refolding was monitored by mea-
suring the increase in luminescence. The luciferase
refolding curves for Ydj1:Ssa2, Ydj1:Ssa4, and Ydj1
alone in (B) are adapted from (A) for comparison.

and Ste11 in strains with different Ssa Hsp70 isoforms reveal
clear distinctions between the roles of the constitutive and
stress-inducible Hsp70s in the Hsp90 chaperoning pathway.
The growth of A3 and A4 cells, even with v-Src overexpres-
sion, could either be due to a cytoprotective action of the
stress-inducible Ssa Hsp70 isoforms or lack of the function
required for folding of the Hsp90 substrate to its active
conformation that iscriticalforuncontrolled protein tyrosine
phosphorylation.Severallinesofevidencesuggestthatalack
of v-Src folding protects cells from growth arrest. First, the
level of protein phosphorylation is signiﬁcantly lower in the
A4 than in the A2 strain, and suggests reduced accumulation
of active v-Src kinase. Second, the higher degradation rate of
v-Src in A4 than in A2 cells is also an indication of its reduced
maturation. Third, the wild-type strain expressing all four
Ssa Hsp70 isoforms when grown under heat-stress condi-
tions is unable to reduce v-Src toxicity, and suggests a re-
cessive role for Ssa3 or Ssa4 with regard to v-Src-associated
toxicity (Figure S9). These results thus suggest that consti-
tutively expressed Ssa Hsp70s cooperate better than their
stress-inducible members with Hsp90s for folding of their
client proteins. It is likely that the evolutionary pressure on
Hsp70s to coordinate with Hsp90s might have been more
selective toward the constitutively present Ssa Hsp70s rather
than for those isoforms that are expressed only under stress.
Thus, these results suggest that in addition to their redun-
dant roles, the constitutive and stress-inducible Hsp70 mem-
bers also evolved with more specialized distinct functions,
such as their role in the Hsp90 pathway. This agrees with our
previous results showing that A3 cells more effectively re-
duce a-synuclein toxicity than A2 cells; this cytoprotective
effect is primarily mediated through autophagy (Gupta et al.
2018).
Hsp90 coordinates with Hsp70 for many of its cellular
functions. Interaction studies using immunoprecipitation of
FLAG-v-Src have revealed that the client interacts poorly with
Hsp90s in A4 compared with the A2 strain. Since the same
Hsp90 isoforms are present in the A2 and A4 strains, it is
intriguing to note that the v-Src interaction with Hsp90 is
strain-dependent. Both the A2 and A4 strains are isogenic
except for the presence of Ssa2 and Ssa4, respectively, and
thus the distinct v-Src-Hsp90 interactions must be regulated
by the Hsp70 isoforms or their interacting cochaperones. The

Hsp70 interactions with Hsp90 are known to be mediated
through the nucleotide-binding domain as well as the EEVD
motif present at the C-termini of these proteins (Kravats et al.
2017). Our results from the pull-down assay show that both
Ssa2 and Ssa4 interact similarly with Hsp82, and thus the
relatively weaker interaction of v-Src with Hsp82 in the A4
strain might be due to a cellular process upstream of the
Hsp70-Hsp90 collaboration.
Next, we ﬁnd that the v-Src interaction with Ssa4 is rela-
tively weaker than the interaction with Ssa2, which could be
the basis for the relatively poor interaction observed between
v-Src and Hsp90 in the A4 strain. Similar to other known
substrates, v-Src could interact with Hsp70s either directly or
through the Hsp70 cochaperone Ydj1 (Dey et al. 1996). The
pull-down study using His6-tagged Ydj1 shows that the
cochaperone interaction with v-Src is similar in both the A2
and A4 strains. Furthermore, the pull-down study revealed
that the Ydj1 interaction with Ssa2 is stronger than with Ssa4.
The weaker interaction of Ydj1 with Ssa4 was further con-
ﬁrmed using puriﬁed chaperones in vitro. The relatively
weaker interaction of Ydj1 with Ssa4 is in agreement with
the lower luciferase refolding activity seen in the reactions
containing Ydj1 and Ssa4 instead of Ssa2. Ssa2 was able to
promote luciferase refolding at levels 25–30 times greater
than for Ssa4. Similarly, higher activity was observed with
Ssa2 than with Ssa4 when luciferase refolding assays were
carried out in the presence of Hsp82, with either of the Hsp70
isoforms and Ydj1. This study generally reveals a novel dis-
tinction in the interactions of Ydj1 with Ssa2 vs. the interac-
tions with Ssa4. As the Ssa4 interaction with Ydj1 is relatively
weaker, it is possible that this leads to poor substrate transfer
from Ydj1 to Ssa4, resulting in lower abundance of the v-Src-
Ssa4 complex, as observed in the immunoprecipitated com-
plex against v-Src.
Hsp40 proteins are known to interact at the NBD (Jiang
et al. 2007) or the C-terminal domain of Hsp70 (Demand
Figure 9 Model of how Ydj1 regulates activity of
Ssa2 and Ssa4. Misfolded v-Src interacts with Ydj1.
Ydj1 further recruits v-Src to Hsp70. Solid black ar-
row represents transfer of v-Src to Ssa2 while
dashed arrow represents the fact that Ydj1 is not
able to transfer v-Src to Ssa4. Lack of Ydj1-Ssa4
interaction results in degradation of v-Src and cell
survival in Ssa4 background. Hsp90 interacts with
Ssa2, thus v-Src is transferred to Hsp90 and gets
matured. v-Src maturation through Hsp90 results
in cell death in Ssa2 background.
Ydj1 Speciﬁes Hsp70 Function

et al. 1998; Gong et al. 2018), and inﬂuence Hsp70 function
(Sluder et al. 2018). The C-terminal domains of Ssa2 and
Ssa4 are more divergent (i.e., a sequence identity of 42%)
than their NBDs (i.e., a sequence identity of 87%). The in-
teraction of Ydj1 with the NBD stimulates the ATPase activity
of Hsp70 (Laufen et al. 1999; Jiang et al. 2007), whereas
those at the C-terminal domain are known to facilitate sub-
strate transfer (Freeman et al. 1995; Demand et al. 1998).
The pull-down assay shows that the Ydj1 interaction with
Ssa24 is stronger than it is with Ssa42 and suggests that
the Ydj1-Ssa interaction is primarily mediated by the
N-terminal domain. Our study used the hybrid Ssa chaper-
ones Ssa24 and Ssa42, showing that cells expressing Ssa24
reduce v-Src toxicity better than those expressing Ssa42, and
reveals that the C-terminal domain mediates the functional
distinction of Ssa proteins in the Hsp90 chaperoning path-
way. It is possible that, although Ydj1 interacts strongly with
Ssa24 through its N-terminal domain, its interaction with the
less-conserved C-terminal domain of Ssa4 remains compro-
mised and results in poor v-Src transfer to the hybrid Ssa
Hsp70, and leads to relatively lower maturation of the kinase.
This is in agreement with the lower abundance of the v-Src-
Ssa4 complex in the A4 strain (Figure 4), although Ydj1 in-
teracts similarly with v-Src in both the A2 and A4 strains. Our
results suggest that although the N-terminal domain of
Hsp70 governs its interaction with Ydj1, the C-terminal do-
main determines the functional speciﬁcity between Ssa2 and
Ssa4 with respect to v-Src toxicity.
The pull-down experiments using Ydj1 further reveal its
interaction with Hsp90. The Ydj1 interaction with Hsp90
could either be direct or indirect through Hsp70. Since Ydj1
shows similar interactions with Hsp90 in spite of the different
afﬁnities toward the Ssa Hsp70 isoforms, the interaction of
Ydj1withHsp90(asseeninthepull-downassay)ismorelikely
to be a direct interaction. Furthermore, as Ydj1 interacts
similarly with Hsp90 in the A2 and A4 strains, the distinct
v-Src activity and related toxicity might not be due to any
activity associated with the formation of the Ydj1-Hsp90
complex in these strains.
In summary, our data suggest that v-Src interacts similarly
with Ydj1 in the A2 and A4 strains, but that the client transfer
from Ydj1 to Hsp70 is less efﬁcient for Ssa4 than for Ssa2. The
lack of v-Src-Ssa4 interaction leads to substrate inactivation
and degradation. In contrast, v-Src is transferred efﬁciently to
Ssa2. Hsp90 then interacts with v-Src and promotes its mat-
uration to an active kinase (Figure 9).
Hsp70s are involved in a variety of cellular functions.
Although different Hsp70 isoforms perform many redun-
dant functions, functional distinctions among these are also
known. What governs the functional speciﬁcity among
highly homologous Hsp70s is not clear and the role of
the cochaperones is generally believed to the underlying
basis of speciﬁcity. The current study shows that different
Ssa Hsp70 isoforms function distinctly in the Hsp90 chaper-
oning functions. Interestingly, the functional distinctions of
the Ssa Hsp70 isoforms lie upstream of their interactions
with the cochaperone Ydj1. Thus, the results provided here
show that Hsp40s are not only required to activate the
Hsp70 reaction cycle, but also inﬂuence its function and
thus provide functional diversity within members of the
Hsp70 family.
