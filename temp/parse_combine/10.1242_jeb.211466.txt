ABSTRACT
For many fish species, rhythmic movement of the pectoral fins, or
forelimbs, drives locomotion. In terrestrial vertebrates, normal limb-
based
rhythmic
gaits
require
ongoing
modulation
with
limb
mechanosensors. Given the complexity of the fluid environment and
dexterity
of
fish
swimming
through
it,
we
hypothesize
that
mechanosensory modulation is also critical to normal fin-based
swimming. Here, we examined the role of sensory feedback from the
pectoral fin rays and membrane on the neuromuscular control and
kinematics of pectoral fin-based locomotion. Pectoral fin kinematics
and electromyograms of the six major fin muscles of the parrotfish,
Scarus quoyi, a high-performance pectoral fin swimmer, were
recorded
during
steady
swimming
before
and
after
bilateral
transection of the sensory nerves extending into the rays and
surrounding membrane. Alternating activity of antagonistic muscles
was observed and drove the fin in a figure-of-eight fin stroke trajectory
before and after nerve transection. After bilateral transections, pectoral
fin rhythmicity remained the same or increased. Differences in fin
kinematics with the loss of sensory feedback also included fin
kinematics with a significantly more inclined stroke plane angle, an
increased angular velocity and fin beat frequency, and a transition to
the body-caudal fin gait at lower speeds. After transection, muscles
were active over a larger proportion of the fin stroke, with overlapping
activation of antagonistic muscles rarely observed in the trials of intact
fish. The increased overlap of antagonistic muscle activity might stiffen
the fin system in order to enhance control and stability in the absence
of sensory feedback from the fin rays. These results indicate that fin
ray sensation is not necessary to generate the underlying rhythm of fin
movement, but contributes to the specification of pectoral fin motor
pattern and movement during rhythmic swimming.

INTRODUCTION
The pectoral fins of fishes perform dual and interacting roles as
motors and sensors. As motors, the pectoral fins are used during
posture maintenance, maneuvering and braking (Higham et al.,
2005), and serve as primary locomotor propulsors for many species
(Walker and Westneat, 1997, 2002a,b). As mechanosensors, the
pectoral fins respond to fin ray bending, and the sensory nerves
innervating the fin rays encode fin ray movement, speed of
movement and position (Williams et al., 2013; Hardy et al., 2016;
Aiello et al., 2017, 2018). In bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus),
pectoral fin sensory feedback is necessary for generating normal
hovering behavior, and the loss of feedback results in atypical
kinematics, higher fin beat frequencies and reduced pectoral fin ray
curvature throughout the fin stroke (Williams and Hale, 2015).
Further, a behavioral analysis of bluegill sunfish navigating a
complex environment found that fish use their pectoral fins to touch
obstacles and, in the absence of other sensory modalities (e.g. lateral
line and vision), obstacle tapping increases (Flammang and Lauder,
2013). Together, these studies indicate that pectoral fin ray sensory
feedback integrates into the activity of motor control circuits to
modulate motor output and swimming behaviors.
The role of mechanosensation in locomotion has also been
studied in terrestrial animals. The loss of mechanosensation
significantly impairs the ability to complete complex and precise
movements (Cooper et al., 1993). For example, while typical limb
rhythms can still be observed after the loss of sensory feedback in
vertebrates (e.g. Brown and Sherrington, 1912; Sherrington, 1913),
central pattern generator (CPG)-driven movement occurs with
atypical kinematics (Polit and Bizzi, 1978, 1979; Bosco and
Poppele, 2001), reduced accuracy and adaptability (Grillner, 1975;
Sanes et al., 1985; Nathan et al., 1986), and other sensory
modalities, such as vision, are required to provide compensatory
feedback on limb movements (e.g. Sanes et al., 1985).
Despite the presence of atypical kinematics, only slight changes
to the timing and intensity of muscle activity occur after the loss of
sensory feedback (Székely et al., 1969; Hnik et al., 1982; Thoumie
and Do, 1996). For example, the duration of muscle activity patterns
is more variable and the consistent order of activation among a
synergistic suite of muscles is not always retained after the loss of
sensory feedback (Székely et al., 1969; Grillner and Zangger, 1984).
Studies in tetrapods also note that the activity in some muscles
increases in both intensity and duration after the loss of sensory
feedback (Székely et al., 1969; Grillner and Zangger, 1975; Perret
and Cabelguen, 1976, 1980). Similar results have been found in
other systems. For example, after the loss of sensory feedback from
the wings of insects, the activity in elevator muscles increased in
intensity and became more variable (Wilson and Gettrup, 1963;
Pearson and Wolf, 1987), and elevators fired later in the wing phase,
overlapping with the subsequent firing of depressors (Pearson and
Wolf, 1987).
In fishes, the movement and the shape of the pectoral fins are
controlled through a suite of proximal muscles. Muscles attaching to
the proximal portion of each fin ray allow for independent actuation
and control of its movement (Westneat, 1996) and, thus, of the fin as a
whole (Geerlink and Videler, 1987; Lauder et al., 2011). Fishes are
suggested to be capable of actively controlling the stiffness and
curvature of individual fin rays through the differential activityof their
antagonistic muscles (Geerlink and Videler, 1987; Alben et al., 2007;
Lauder et al., 2011). In comparison to rigid structures, an

advantageous deformation pattern of a flexible propulsor (e.g. insect
wings and the fins of fishes) can increase propulsive capability
(Daniel and Combes, 2002), locomotor efficiency (Yamamoto et al.,
1995; Zhu and Shoele, 2008; Young et al., 2009) and maneuverability
(Tangorra et al., 2010; Lauder et al., 2011; Flammang et al., 2013).
Here, we examined how the loss of fin ray mechanosensation
impacts pectoral fin muscle activity patterns and kinematics during
labriform (pectoral fin-based) swimming. This is the first study to
examine the effect of fin ray denervation on propulsive swimming
and the first to assess the impact of denervation on muscle activity
during any rhythmic fin movement. We hypothesized that pectoral
fin ray proprioceptive feedback helps regulate the activity patterns
of muscles actuating the fin, and the loss of fin ray proprioception
will lead to increased variance in fin kinematics and muscle activity.
To test these hypotheses, electromyograms of the six major fin
muscles and synchronized 3D kinematics were recorded from the
pectoral fin of the parrotfish, Scarus quoyi. Next, we performed
bilateral transection of all sensory nerves innervating the pectoral fin
rays, and examined the effects on 3D fin kinematics and the activity
patterns of the muscles that actuate the fin. In this study, we focused
on loss of sensory input from the fin rays and membrane and did not
disrupt more proximal innervation of the fin.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Fish specimens and experimental overview
Six terminal phase male parrotfish, Scarus quoyi Valenciennes
1840, were used in this study (standard length range 11.5–15.5 cm,
mean±s.d. 13.15±1.67 cm). Parrotfish were obtained commercially
and housed in aquaria equipped with recirculating water filters.
Water temperature was maintained at ∼23°C and the fish were
exposed to a 12 h:12 h light:dark cycle. Before each experiment,
each fish was anesthetized in a solution of MS-222 (0.25 g l−1).
Bilateral incisions were made through the skin and the connective
tissue overlaying the medial side of the most proximal portion of the
left and right pectoral fins to expose the sensory nerves innervating
the pectoral fin rays. In previous work, no difference in bluegill
sunfish pectoral fin hovering kinematics was found before and after
the conduction of sham experiments, where a skin incision was
made to expose the intact pectoral fin ray nerves (Williams and
Hale, 2015). Further, in this study, the performance of surgery prior
to control swimming ensured that differences in kinematics and
motor patterns between trials before and after the loss of sensory
feedback (nerve transection) were due to the loss of sensory feedback
and not to the effects of surgery. A single bipolar electrode was then
inserted into each of the six major muscles actuating the left pectoral
fin. Fish were allowed to recover, placed in a flow tank, and then
swam at a speed of 2 body lengths (equivalent to total length) per
second (BL s−1). After each fish completed its control swimming
trials, it was lightly anesthetized and the already exposed sensory
nerves were transected. The sensory nerves were initially identified
in prior work using immunohistochemistry (Thorsen and Hale,
2007; Williams et al., 2013), and confirmed through dissection in S.
quoyi prior to experimentation. The nerves are completelysuperficial
to the underlying musculature and only innervate the fin rays and
membrane of the fin. The fish was allowed to recover and was then
placed back in the flow tank to repeat the swimming procedure. 3D
kinematics and motor control patterns were recorded and analyzed at
2 BL s−1 before and after the loss of fin ray sensory feedback.
Finally, the speed at which each fish transitioned from the pectoral
fin to body-caudal fin (BCF) gait was measured before and after
afferent nerve transection. Flow speed was increased in a step-wise
manner where speed was increased by 0.5 BL s−1, stabilized for
1 min, then increased again by 0.5 BL s−1. Flow speed was increased
in this manner until the fish transitioned to the BCF gait. All
experimental procedures were carried out under University of
Chicago Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines
(protocol 72365 to M.W.W.; protocol 71589 to M.E.H.).
Surgical procedures and electrode implantation
Surgery and electromyography (EMG) electrode implantation
followed published methods (Westneat and Walker, 1997; Aiello
et al., 2014). Electrodes were made using 0.005 mm diameter
insulated stainless steel bipolar wire (California Fine Wire, Grover
Beach, CA, USA). After approximately 0.5 mm of insulation was
stripped from the tip of each monopole, the wire was fed through a
26 gauge needle and formed into a twist hook (Loeb and Gans,
1986). A single electrode was placed in six different muscles: three
lateral muscles [arrector ventralis (ARV), abductor profundus
(ABP), abductor superficialis (ABS)] and three medial muscles
[arrector dorsalis (ARD), adductor profundus (ADP), adductor
superficialis (ADS)] (Fig. 1). Hot glue was then used to bind the six
wires together into a single cable, which was subsequently run
dorsally and sutured to the base of the first ray of the dorsal fin.
These six electrodes were left in throughout the duration of the
experiment and were the same electrodes used for EMG recordings
after nerve transection. Upon completion of the experiment, animals
were killed in a high concentration of MS-222 and electrode
implantation was confirmed post mortem.
Data acquisition
EMG and kinematic recordings took place after the fish had recovered
for approximately 1–2 h after surgery. EMG signals were amplified
by a factor of 10,000, bandpass filtered from 30 Hz to 6 kHz, and
notch filtered at 60 Hz using a Grass amplifier (Model 15LT, Grass
Technologies, Astro-MED Inc., West Warwick, RI, USA). Signals
were then acquired and saved to a computer at 5000 Hz using
PolyVIEW16 software (Grass Technologies) after being passed
through a Grass PVA-16 A/D converter (Grass Technologies).
EMG recordings were collected while each fish was filmed
swimming in a flow tank (Vogel and Labarbera, 1978) with a total
volume
of
360 l
and
working
volume
dimensions
of
30 cm×30 cm×60 cm. Fish were filmed at 500 frames s−1 with
three synchronized Photron high-speed digital video cameras at
1024×1024
pixel
spatial
resolution
(FASTCAM
APX-RS,
FASTCAM SA7 and Mini UX 100, Photron, San Diego, CA,
USA). Two cameras with lateral views were placed with slightly
offset angles and the third camera was placed at an equal distance
from the tank and filmed the ventral view of the fish using a mirror
placed below the flow tank working area at an angle of 45 deg. EMG
and video data were synchronized with the application of a time
stamp on the EMG record.
EMG and kinematic analysis
For each trial, video and EMG data were analyzed for five
continuous fin stroke cycles. Basic kinematic data (abduction onset
and duration, adduction onset and duration, and the lag time
between consecutive fin strokes) were collected for each fin stroke.
In our four-phase fin stroke, the protraction period began after the
fin ceased adduction and began to protract forward, the abduction
period began as soon as the fin began to abduct more than 1 deg
from its position at the termination of adduction, fin reversal
occurred during the short duration after the fin ceased abducting and
before it began adducting, and adduction began as soon as the fin
adducted more than 1 deg from its fully abducted position. EMG

data were analyzed using a custom MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick,
MA, USA) routine (Jose Iriarte-Diaz, University of Illinois-
Chicago). For each EMG burst, the onset time (EMGon), offset
time (EMGoff), duration (EMGdur=EMGoff−EMGon), time of peak
amplitude (EMGpeak) and rectified integrated area (RIA) were
calculated. Variables were calculated in absolute time (seconds) and
converted to a percentage of the fin stroke cycle relative to the start
of pectoral fin abduction.
In a subset of the individuals (N=4; standard length range 12.2–
15.5 cm, mean±s.d. 13.80±1.69 cm), 3D pectoral fin kinematics
were also collected. Videos were digitized using the StereoMorph
package (Olsen and Westneat, 2015) in R (http://www.R-project.org/).
In at least two views for every other video frame, the tip and base of
the leading edge fin ray were digitized as landmarks and a curve
(described by 50 evenly spaced points or semi-landmarks) was fitted
along the length of the ray. The tip and base of the trailing edge fin
ray and most central fin ray were also digitized. Several body
landmarks were also digitized in at least two views for every 10 video
frames: the rostral tip of the dorsal beak, the left eye, the base of the
left and right pelvic fins, the most rostral attachment of the anal fin,
the most rostral intersection of the left and right opercula, and several
midline natural skin coloration markings that were unique to each
fish. Several variables were then calculated over the length of each
fin stroke: the fin angle relative to the fully adducted position (stroke
amplitude), leading edge fin ray curvature, the 3D path of the leading
edge fin ray tip, angular velocity and acceleration, and stroke plane
angle relative to the anterior–posterior (AP), dorsal–ventral (DV)
and medial–lateral (ML) axes. The 2D stroke plane angle (β) was
calculated following the methods of Walker and Westneat (1997). To
measure 3D stroke plane angle, we first fitted a plane, using the ‘svd’
function in R (http://www.R-project.org/), to body-aligned leading
edge base and tip landmarks superimposed over a complete stroke
(downstroke and upstroke). In this way, the plane describes the
orientation of the space traversed by the leading fin ray during a
complete stroke relative to the body. This plane is also oriented
approximately orthogonal to the surface of the pectoral fin. We then
projected the three body axes into the stroke plane to create projected
body axis vectors, parallel to the stroke plane but also parallel to a
corresponding body plane. The craniocaudal (AP) axis (X) was
projected so that it was parallel to the sagittal plane, the DV axis (Y)
was projected so that it was parallel to the coronal plane, and the ML
axis (Z) was projected so that it was parallel to the transverse plane.
Each stroke plane angle (AP, DV and ML) was then calculated as the
angle between each body axis and the corresponding projected body
axis vector (see Fig. S2A). Pectoral fin chord-wise camber was also
calculated by fitting a plane to the four corners of the fin (leading
edge base, leading edge tip, trailing edge base, trailing edge tip) and
then calculating the distance between this plane and the tip of the
central fin ray. Larger distances are indicative of larger degrees of
chordwise bending (camber). To test whether tip trajectories differed
significantly between test and transection strokes, we used shape
analysis, treating the trajectory of the leading edge fin ray tip (defined
by the 3D coordinate at 75 proportional time points) for each fin
stroke (N=41; 19 control and 22 transection) as a separate shape. We
used Procrustes
superimposition
to
optimally align
the
tip
trajectories
for
each
stroke
with
each
other
and
principal
components analysis (PCA) to identify the major axes of variation
in trajectory shape. We then used t-tests to test for significant
differences in mean trajectory shape along each of the first three PC
axes. Excluding rotation of the trajectory shapes in the Procrustes
alignment did not change the conclusions.
Statistical analyses were performed on the data in R 3.2.1 (http://
www.R-project.org/) and JMP 9.0.1 (SAS, Cary, NC, USA). The
rhythmicity of the fin stroke cycle (relative variance in the cycle
period) was calculated as the coefficient of variation (Ross et al.,

was also calculated for fin beat frequency, EMGon, EMGdur,
EMGpeak and RIA before and after the loss of sensory feedback
(transection) as a standardized measure of variation in the data.
Student’s t-tests were also used to test for significant differences
between the control and transection trials for several variables: fin
beat frequency, EMGon, EMGdur, EMGpeak, RIA and the CV of each
of these variables. A PCA of the 3D shape of the fin stroke trajectory
was conducted in R following published methods (Olsen, 2017),
and each fin stroke was treated as a unique species. Finally, the lm
(linear model) and aov (analysis of variance) functions were used
to conduct a multi-factor ANOVA in R to test for significant
differences in 3D kinematic variables before and after the loss of
sensory feedback. The factors in the ANOVA were individual and
experimental group (control or transection), and all P-values were
adjusted for multiple comparisons.
RESULTS
Pectoral fin kinematics before and after loss of sensory
function
The pectoral fin beat cycle can be divided into four main phases:
a protraction period where the fin is protracted before the start
of abduction, abduction (downstroke), a short reversal period
where the fin is rotated about its long axis to reorient the
leading edge between abduction and adduction, and adduction
(upstroke) (Fig. 2).

Fin beat frequency, fin beat rhythmicity, and the speed at which
each fish transitioned from the pectoral to BCF gait were measured
before and after the loss of fin ray sensory feedback. In fish with an
intact sensory pectoral fin ray sensory system, fin beat frequency
averaged 4.78±1.02 Hz and significantly increased to 5.71±0.87 Hz
(Table 1, Fig. 3A) after nerve transection. Fin beat rhythmicity was
measured by calculating the CV of fin beat duration (Table 1). In
intact fish, fin beat duration CV averaged 9.71±7.33. After the loss
of fin ray sensory feedback, the CV of fin beat duration was not
significantly different and averaged 8.57±4.55. The speed at which
the transition between the pectoral fin and BCF gait occurred
significantly decreased from 4.80±0.57 BL s−1 prior to transection
to 3.40±0.55 BL s−1 after transection (Fig. 3B, Table 2).
The loss of sensory feedback impacted the relative proportion
occupied by each component of the fin cycle (Table 1). The loss of
sensory feedback resulted in a shorter protraction phase (P=0.001)
and longer adduction phase (P=0.001). The portion of the fin cycle
dedicated to abduction and reversal did not change after the loss of
fin ray sensory feedback (P>0.05). However, after the loss of sensory
feedback, the absolute duration of each fin stroke phase was
significantly shorter (P<0.05). The protraction, abduction, reversal
and adduction phases decreased from 0.018±0.01 to 0.009±0.0057 s,
0.092±0.021 to 0.0764±0.014 s, 0.009±0.008 to 0.005±0.002 s, and
0.099±0.025 to 0.088±0.017 s, respectively, before and after the loss
of fin ray sensory feedback.
3D analysis of the fin stroke before and after loss of sensory
feedback
We conducted an analysis of 3D pectoral fin kinematics to analyze
the impact of the loss of fin ray sensory feedback on the subtler
parameters of a fin stroke that could impact hydrodynamic
performance. A 3D outline of the trajectory of the leading edge
fin ray tip throughout the fin stroke revealed a figure-of-eight pattern
when viewed laterally (Fig. 4A). In intact individuals, the fin beat
amplitude, measured as the angle between the body and the leading
edge fin ray, averaged 65.88±10.86 deg at peak downstroke (Fig. 5,
Table 3). The fin AP, DV and ML 3D stroke plane angles averaged
54.40±10.18, 62.02±19.97 and 20.41±12.57 deg, respectively
(Table 3; Fig. S2A). Maximum angular velocity calculated using 3D
kinematics was similar during the downstroke and upstroke and
occurred at 23.08±2.93% and 70.30±5.00% fin cycle, respectively
(Fig. 5C, Table 3). Maximum angular acceleration always occurred
near mid-stroke (Fig. 5D, Table 3). Finally, peak leading edge fin ray
curvatureoccurredjustbeforethefinreachedmaximumvelocityduring
the downstroke and just after the fin reached maximum velocity during
the upstroke. Peak curvature averaged 0.027±0.005 mm−1 during the
downstroke and 0.020±0.005 mm−1 during the upstroke (Fig. 5,
Table 3). The maximum chordwise camber of the fin averaged
5.66±1.02 mm during the downstroke and 5.40±1.63 mm during the
upstroke (Table 3).
3D pectoral fin kinematics at 2 BLs−1 were also measured after
the loss of sensory feedback. The average duration of the protraction
period was shorter after transection. The fin stroke was significantly
altered after the loss of sensory feedback. The AP stroke plane angle
was significantly greater after the loss of sensory feedback (adjusted
P<0.0001; Figs S1 and S2, Table S1; Table 3), increasing by
approximately 10 deg to an average of 65.36±6.68 deg (Table 3;
Fig. S2A) after transection. Finally, the angular velocity of the
downstroke was significantly greater after the loss of sensory
feedback (adjusted P=0.027; Fig. S1, Table S1).
Several 3D kinematic variables were not significantly different
after the loss of sensory feedback (Fig. S1, Table S1; Table 3). A
PCA showed that the trajectory of the fin stroke was not significantly
different after the loss of sensory feedback when differences in
stroke plane angle were taken into account (Fig. S2B). For the PC1
comparison, P=0.07 when corrected for differences in stroke plane
and P=0.04 when differences in stroke plane are not taken into
account; all comparisons for PC2 and PC3 resulted in P>0.05. The
amplitude of the fin stroke, peak leading edge fin ray curvature
during the downstroke and upstroke, the time at which each
curvature peak occurred within the fin cycle, and the average
maximum chordwise camber during the upstroke and downstroke
were not significantly different after the loss of sensory feedback
(adjusted P>0.05; Fig. S1, Table S1; Fig. 5, Table 3). Using the 3D
kinematics we also found that the maximum angular acceleration,

Fig. 4. Trajectory of the leading edge pectoral fin ray at 2 BL s−1. The tip of the leading edge fin ray was traced in trials before and after the loss of sensory
feedback. The trajectory of the fin stroke is shown projected in the sagittal (A,D), frontal (B,E) and transverse (C,F) planes (see insets) for a single fin stroke
(A–C) and summarized across all individuals (D–F) before and after the loss of sensory feedback. This representation of the fin stroke trajectory removes the
effects of fin stroke plane angle (the orientation of the fin stroke relative to the body in each plane). After the differences in fin stroke angle were removed,
there were no significant differences between trials before and after the loss of sensory feedback (see Fig. S3 for fin stroke shape principal components analysis).
Bold lines in D–F represent group averages.

maximum angular velocity during the upstroke, and the proportion
of the fin cycle at which maximum angular velocity was reached
during the upstroke were not significantly different after transection
(P>0.05; Fig. S1, Table S1; Fig. 5, Table 3). The 3D ML stroke
plane angle also did not significantly differ after the loss of sensory
feedback (mean±s.d. 16.50±11.28 deg; adjusted P=0.598).
Muscle activity patterns during pectoral fin swimming before
and after the loss of sensory feedback
Muscle activity onset, duration and time of peak amplitude were
calculated for six muscles that actuate the pectoral fin. In intact fish,
activity in the three muscles of the abductor complex – ARV, ABP
and ABS – began at similar times (no greater than 9.54% fin cycle
between the onset of any muscles in this group), but were always
activated in sequence, with a consistent order of ARV, ABP and
then ABS onset (Fig. 6A; Table S2). Abductor muscle activity
began before or during the fin protraction period when the fin was
undergoing protraction. Similar trends were found for the adductor
muscle complex of intact fish (Fig. 6A; Table S2). The three
adductors were consistently activated in the following order: ARD,
ADP and ADS (Fig. 6A).
The overlap in activity between antagonistic muscle pairs (ARV–
ARD, ABP–ADP and ABS–ADS) was calculated across two sections
of the fin stroke: (1) the span of the fin stroke that includes fin reversal,
the end of abduction and the start of adduction, and (2) between
consecutive fin strokes during the protraction period. Points of fin
reversal and the transition between consecutive fin strokes are
relevant markers within the stroke because these are the times during
the fin stroke that antagonistic muscle activity is most likely to
overlap. In intact fish, for each pair, there was no overlap in activity
between antagonistic muscles (Fig. 7; Table S2). The overlap in
activity between antagonistic muscles at the transition between
consecutive fin beats (protraction period) showed similar trends to
those seen at the midpoint (fin reversal between downstroke and
upstroke) of each fin beat, but was lower in magnitude.
Muscle activity patterns were also recorded after pectoral fin
afferents were transected (Fig. 6B; Table S2). Relative to the
beginning of the fin stroke, the loss of sensory feedback resulted in
significantly earlier average activity onset, later average offset, and
thus an overall significant increase in activity duration for both
groups of muscles (P<0.05; Fig. 6; Table S2). However, the
relative time of peak EMG amplitude within the fin stroke did not
change for any muscle after transection (Fig. S3A, Table S2).
Further, muscle onset variability (CV) was not significantly
different after transection (P>0.05; Table S2). After transection,
the RIA of the EMG for each muscle was approximately double the
RIA recorded in trials with an intact sensory system, and these
differences were significant for each muscle (P<0.01; Fig. S3B,
Table S2). The overlap in activity between antagonistic muscles
occurring midway between the downstroke and upstroke (fin
reversal period) also significantly increased for all three antagonistic
pairs after transection (P<0.0001; Fig. 7; Table S3). Prior to
transection, no overlap occurred, whereas post-transection the
overlap between antagonists averaged 8.24±15.18, 9.61±18.26 and
17.38±15.31% fin cycle for the arrector, profundus and superficialis
pairs, respectively. Overlap in activity between antagonistic
muscles also occurred between subsequent fin strokes during the
protraction period after transection and showed similar trends to the
overlap occurring between the downstroke and upstroke (Table S3).
After the loss of sensory feedback, overlap in activity between
antagonistic muscles significantly increased during the protraction
period (P<0.0001; Table S3).

DISCUSSION
In our experiments, sensory nerves that exclusively innervate the
pectoral fin rays (and no associated proximal musculature) were
transected between the control and experimental trials. It is likely
that sensation of more proximal regions of the fin also informs
movement, but it is unlikely that the muscles of teleost fishes are
innervated by muscle spindles. Other than a single study in jaw
muscle (Maeda et al., 1983) that has not been duplicated, spindles
have not been identified in the muscles of teleost fishes despite
investigation (Barker, 1974). Putative sensors have been indicated
to be present in the tendons attached to the base of teleost fin rays
(Pansini, 1888; Fessard and Sand, 1937; Ono, 1979), in the
connective tissue associated with myotomal muscles in fishes (Ono,
1982), and in the joints and muscles associated with fins in
chondrichthyans (Wunderer, 1908; Fessard and Sand, 1937;
Lowenstein, 1956). While sensors innervating the proximal
muscles, tendons and/or joints of the pectoral fin system have not
been identified in any wrasse species, it is likely they exist and
continued to provide sensory feedback during our transection
experiments. Any changes in kinematics or muscle activity patterns
after sensory nerve transection were entirely due to the loss of
sensory feedback exclusively from the pectoral fin rays.
The effect of losing pectoral fin ray sensory feedback on
pectoral fin kinematics
Pectoral fin rhythmicity is not dependent on fin ray sensory
feedback: with the loss of pectoral fin ray sensory feedback in S.
quoyi, rhythmicity was maintained or increased (Fig. 3B). It is
presumed that rhythmic and coordinated pectoral fin movement is
driven by a local CPG, as is the case for other vertebrate limb
systems (e.g. Grillner, 1975; Grillner and Zangger, 1979; Grillner
and Zangger, 1984; Grillner, 1985). For example, in tetrapods,
mechanosensation provides feedback to modulate rhythmicity (Katz
and Harris-Warrick, 1990) and can reinforce rhythmicity (Fuchs
et al., 2012) in central pattern generating circuits. In the pectoral fin
system, the maintenance of pectoral fin rhythmicity is not dependent
on mechanosensory feedback from the pectoral fin rays.
We found that the pectoral fin stroke plane was significantly
different after the loss of sensory feedback in S. quoyi. The loss of fin
ray sensory feedback resulted in fin movement with a significantly
greater angular velocity during the downstroke (Table 3; Figs S1,
S2A), and a more vertical stroke plane caused by a significant
increase in the AP stroke plane angle (Table 3; Figs S1, S2A).
However, the trajectory of the fin stroke was not significantly
different after the loss of sensory feedback when differences in the
stroke plane angle were taken into account (Fig. 4; Fig. S3). In other
words, the shape of the fin stroke was not changed after the loss of fin
ray sensory feedback; however, the position of the fin throughout the
fin stroke relative to the body was significantly different after the loss
of fin ray sensory feedback (Table 3; Figs S1, S2A). The loss of limb
sensory feedback in tetrapods often results in atypical kinematics
of varying degree (Polit and Bizzi, 1978, 1979; Nathan et al., 1986;
Sainburg et al., 1995). Limb movements in human patients with
large-fiber sensory neuropathy are conducted with directional errors
and increased velocity (Bosco and Poppele, 2001), and vision is
needed to provide compensatory feedback on limb movements to
reduce these effects (Sainburg et al., 1993). In most fishes, the eyes
are not well positioned to view the entirety of pectoral fin movement.
Therefore, our data suggest that fin ray sensory feedback is needed to
properly orient and position the fin in space relative to the body.
The increase in fin beat frequency after the loss of sensory
feedback could be an effect of hydrodynamic changes of the fin

stroke. The force production of a fin stroke depends on the flow
speed, angular velocity of the fin, angle of attack of the fin, the fin
stroke plane angle and fin shape. The spatio-temporal patterns of fin
deformation throughout the fin stroke are also known to significantly
impact force production (e.g. Lauder and Drucker, 2004; Esposito
et al., 2012; Flammang et al., 2013). One measure of fin deformation
that significantly impacts the hydrodynamic performance of a
flexible propulsion is camber. Our results indicate that there is no
difference in the average maximum fin camber during the upstroke or
downstroke before and after the loss of fin ray sensory feedback. All
other variables being equal, the more vertically oriented stroke plane
that was used by the fish after the loss of sensory feedback could
orient the lift vector more vertically and the drag vector more
horizontally. As lift is often the more dominant force in flapping
propulsion, a change in stroke plane angle likely results in decreased
thrust per fin stroke. An increase in fin beat frequency results in
increased force production per stroke (Kahn et al., 2012). Scarus
quoyi could therefore be increasing fin beat frequency after the loss
of fin ray sensory feedback as a mechanism to increase thrust
production (Walker and Westneat, 1997).

Journal of Experimental Biology
The transition from the pectoral fin to the BCF gait occurred at a
significantly slower average speed after the loss of fin ray sensory
feedback in S. quoyi (Fig. 3, Table 2). From work on humans
(Margaria, 1938), horses (Hoyt and Taylor, 1987) and fishes
(Korsmeyer et al., 2002), it was also suggested that gait changes
occur in order to minimize energy consumption with changing
speed. In S. quoyi there is likely an increased energy requirement to
support the increased fin beat frequency after deafferentation. If gait
changes in fish are related to energy consumption, then our data fit
this hypothesis. Previous work in juvenile wrasse indicates that
mechanical limits can also act to trigger gait transitions in swimming
fishes (Hale et al., 2006). In this study, deafferentation of pectoral fin
ray nerves resulted in increased pectoral fin beat frequency, which
averaged nearly 6 Hz at 2 BL s−1. It is possible that frequencies of
this range are reaching the biomechanical or physiological limit for a
fish of this size and species, and a gait transition is necessary in order
for S. quoyi to match high flow speeds.
The effect of losing pectoral fin ray sensory feedback on
muscle activity patterns
Pectoral fin ray mechanosensation represents a significant source of
sensory feedback for the adjustment of pectoral fin muscle activity
patterns in S. quoyi. The loss of fin ray sensory feedback results in
similar or more drastic changes to the activity patterns of muscles
controlling locomotion compared with the loss of complete limb
sensory feedback in other systems. Consistent with other systems
(Grillner and Zangger, 1975; Hnik et al., 1982; Thoumie and Do,
1996), the order of activation of muscles relative to one another
was unchanged after deafferentation in this study (Fig. 6B).
The maintenance of a consistent muscle activation order after
deafferentation supports hypotheses that gross limb rhythms and
gross muscle activity patterns are controlled by a CPG and are robust to
the loss of phasic limb sensory feedback. The loss of sensory feedback
has been shown to result in an increase in the amplitude or RIA of
activity in some muscles controlling limb movement in newts (Székely
et al., 1969), cats (Grillnerand Zangger, 1984) and thewings of locusts
(Pearson and Wolf, 1987). In this study, the RIA of every muscle
significantly increased after the loss of sensory feedback (Table S2).
These interspecific differences in motor control variability after the
loss of sensory feedback could be a result of differences in the sensory
system among mammals, amphibians and fishes (Matthews, 1972;
Prochazka et al., 2002; Romanovsky et al., 2007), the return of the
CPG to its intrinsic default pattern, or both. In this study, we only
transected the afferent nerves innervating the pectoral fin rays.
Although any proximal proprioceptors associated with the pectoral fin
would still be intact, the similarities in the resulting motor patterns after
the complete loss of sensory feedback in tetrapod limbs and from only
the fin rays of the pectoral fin in this study suggest that fin ray sensory
feedback contributes significantly to the control of fin movement.
We suggest that increased muscle activity duration and the
occurrence of overlapping activity between antagonistic muscles at
both extremes of the fin stroke increase stability of the pectoral fin
system after the loss of sensory feedback. The most common result of
limb deafferentation across systems is an increase in the duration of
muscle activity and overlap of activity between antagonistic muscles.
The overlap of activity between antagonistic muscles after
deafferentation is seen in the flight system of the locust (Pearson
and Wolf, 1987), the limbs of newts (Székely et al., 1969) and the
limbs of mammals (Grillner and Zangger, 1975; Perret and
Cabelguen, 1976, 1980; Grillner and Zangger, 1984). Prolonged
muscle activity and the presence of overlapping antagonistic muscle
activity after deafferentation is also prominent in the pectoral fin of S.
quoyi (Figs 6 and 7). In animals with intact sensory systems, the co-
contraction of functionally antagonistic muscles commonly occurs
during the completion of fine motor tasks, skilled movements and
elaborate movements (Paillard, 1960). The co-contraction of
antagonistic muscles is a significant feature of grading movements,
joint fixation and general limb stability (Paillard, 1960; Székely
et al., 1969). Limb stiffening by the co-contraction of antagonistic
muscles also occurs in humans learning novel motor tasks
(Bernstein, 1967; Milner and Cloutier, 1993). In the pectoral fin of
S. quoyi, the co-contraction of antagonists likely results in increased
joint stiffness and an increase the stability of fin movement.
