ABSTRACT. In the frame of the IAEA-CRP (Coordinated Research Projects): Enhancing Nuclear Analytical
Techniques to Meet the Needs of Forensic Sciences, an intercomparison exercise was organized between three AMS
laboratories. Aim of the program is to promote the use of nuclear and accelerator-based techniques in routine
forensics practice. In this view, one of the key points is the assessment of the precision and accuracy levels
achievable on material of forensic interest. We review the general structure and status of the project, with
emphasis on results obtained in the analysis of wines of different grape varieties and grounded coffee beans from
different locations such as Brazil, Spain, and Italy. The three laboratories processed the samples according to
different chemical protocols and performed the 14C measurements using different systems: MICADAS in Zurich
and Debrecen and a HVEE 4130HC 3 MV Tandetron in Lecce. Within the quoted uncertainty, the results showed
good reproducibility, indicating that uncertainty level of the order of 0.3% are achieved by AMS on a single
sample while multiple sample analyses results in precision down to 0.1–0.2%. The measured 14C concentrations on
coffee and wine samples resulted to be consistent with atmospheric 14C levels in the growing years.

INTRODUCTION
Since 2017 the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) has undertaken a Coordinated
Research Project (CRP F11021) entitled “Enhancing Nuclear Analytical Techniques to
meet the Needs of Forensics Sciences.” The main scope of the program is to develop and
utilize the capabilities of nuclear and accelerator-based analytical techniques towards
recognized needs of forensic sciences that could not be efficiently addressed by other
methods. Indeed, different techniques such as accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS)
radiocarbon dating, ion beam analysis (IBA), nuclear reactors, and synchrotron-based
analytical methods have important advantages which make them suitable for forensics
applications such as non (or reduced) destructiveness and high analytical sensitivity.
Nevertheless, their application in the forensics practice appears to be still limited by
different reasons including primarily, the instrumental complexity, the high costs of
instrumentation, and to a lesser extent, the scarce knowledge of their potential when
compared with more “traditional” techniques. The aim of the CRP is then to try to
overcome these limitations by building and supporting long-term collaborations and

networking between experts in nuclear analytical techniques and forensic science stakeholders
such as law enforcement agencies, police corps and international organizations. The program
has fourteen participating countries and is structured in four work packages (WPs). The first
three have been defined, mainly, on the base of the specific needs and priorities of the
participating countries: forensic glass analysis (WP1), food authentication and provenance
(WP2), nuclear techniques in heritage forensics (WP3). The fourth one, WP4 (Radiocarbon
for Forensics) is the only one specifically dedicated to a single analytical technique and was
intended, since the beginning, to be in strict connection with the other WPs, in particular
WP2 and WP3.
The applications of radiocarbon dating in forensics is mainly based on the analysis of the excess
of anthropogenic
14C in the terrestrial atmosphere produced by aboveground nuclear
detonation tests carried out after World War II, distributed among the different terrestrial
reservoirs and uptaken by living organisms (Nydal 1968). The reconstruction of the curve
(or “bomb peak”) describing this excess as a function of time and its use as a calibration
curve allows dating of samples younger than ∼70 years and achieve the high chronological
resolutions typically required in forensics (Levin and Hesshaimer 2000; Levin et al. 2010;
Quarta et al. 2005; Hua et al. 2013; Hajdas et al. 2021). The use of “bomb peak dating” in
forensics is surely not new and its diverse applications range from the analysis of human
skeletal remains (Wild et al. 2000; Spalding et al. 2005; Cook et al. 2006; Calcagnile et al.
2013; Brock and Cook 2017; Handlos et al. 2018), to the identification of work of art
forgeries (Caforio et al. 2014; Brock et al. 2019; Hendriks et al. 2019), the analysis of illicit
drugs (Zoppi et al. 2004), the fight against the illegal trade of endangered animals (Wild
et al. 2019; Quarta et al. 2019) and foodstuff (Varga et al. 2020). Nevertheless, one should
note that, despite the wide scientific literature related to the potential of 14C in forensics, its
use in routine practice has been limited. Within WP4, in order to cope with the factors
limiting the impact of AMS dating in forensics, a detailed research program was defined on
the basis of discussions with forensic stakeholders and experts of other analytical
techniques. The need to define common guidelines and quality assurance protocols for the
application of 14C was established, also considering possible ethical issues (Hajdas et al.
2019), interpretation of data and the assessment of the achievable chronological resolution
on classes of samples of interest in forensics.
Indeed, though simple in its basic principles, the proper and correct interpretation of bomb 14C
data can be quite complicated, related to carbon turnover and time of fixation in non-short
living organisms or local deviations from the global average atmospheric curve as due to
natural or anthropogenic causes, for example. Different intercomparison exercises were
then organized and run among the three facilities: CEDAD (Italy), ETHZ (Switzerland),
and Isotoptech-ATOMKI (Hungary) aimed at addressing these issues on sample materials
relevant in forensics such as ivory, bones, paper and textiles (Quarta et al. 2019, 2021).
In this paper, we report on the intercomparison exercise organized in strict collaboration with
WP2 and aimed at exploring the possible contribution of 14C to the analysis of foodstuffs and in
particular coffee and wines. Indeed, though intercomparison exercises are organized and run
regularly within the 14C dating community, these do not include typically foodstuff samples
(Scott 2003; Scott et al. 2010).
Here, the use of 14C can be twofold: supplying additional information about authenticity and
identification of counterfeit or adultered products (Zoppi et al. 2004; Povinec et al. 2020). In
1514

the latter case radiocarbon is used as a tracer of the biogenic fraction and the large isotopic
difference in term of 14C content between fossil (completely depleted in 14C) and biomass-
derived materials (whose 14C concentrations mirrors atmospheric levels) is used to quantify
the relative proportion of the two fractions (Quarta et al. 2013; Haverly et al. 2019; Varga
et al. 2018; Oinonen et al. 2010).
The results obtained in the analysis of wines of different grape varieties, provenances and
vintages and ground coffee beans samples from different locations in the world such as
Brazil, Spain and Italy are presented.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The main goal of the present study is to assess the reproducibility of the measurements obtained
on wines and grounded coffee by the three participating laboratories: CEDAD-Center for
Applied Physics, Dating and Diagnostics at the University of Salento, Lecce, Italy; the
Laboratory of Ion Beam Physics at the ETH in Zurich, Switzerland; and the HEKAL-
Hertelendi Laboratory of Environmental Studies, joint lab of Isotoptech Ltd. and Institute
for Nuclear Research, Debrecen, Hungary.
The laboratories used different procedures to chemically process the samples and are based on
different AMS instruments. In particular, HEKAL and ETHZ are based on a MICADAS
(Mini Carbon Dating System, IonPlus, Switzerland) AMS system operated at 200 kV
(Synal et al. 2007; Molnar et al. 2013) while CEDAD is based on a 3 MV TandetronTM
type accelerator manufactured by High Voltage Engineering Europa, the Netherlands.
Sample Material
Overall, 8 samples were used for the study and submitted for AMS radiocarbon analyses: two
ground coffee samples obtained from two different brands and six bottles of wine.
The coffee samples (sample#1 and sample#2) were obtained from two 250-g packages
available on the market in Brazil. They were opened, carefully mixed, in order to obtain
three homogeneous subsamples, and they were then submitted to the three laboratories for
AMS determinations. Sample#1 was obtained from a popular Brazilian roasted ground
coffee from Melitta brand (Tradicional) packed in 2017. For this coffee, no certification of
origin was available since several farms across Brazil typically supply coffee beans for the
production of packed roasted ground coffee. The second sample (sample#2) was obtained
from the same Melitta brand labeled Sul de Minas, where the name indicates the region
where the respective crops were cultivated and harvested. Therefore, this coffee was
produced in a defined region and its origin was controlled for superior quality, with a
known production year of 2017. The same samples were also submitted in the frame of the
same IAEA CRP to compositional analyses by different techniques such as PIXE (particle
induced X-ray emission) and FTIR (Fourier transform infrared analysis) whose results are
being published elsewhere.
The list of the six analyzed wines is given in Table 2 summarizing vintage, provenance, and
production year as indicated on the label. All the samples were red wines except for sample
#5, which was a white wine. The wines were produced from 2008 to 2019 in different
regions in Italy (South Tyrol, Sardinia), Spain, Portugal, and Brazil. Wine bottles were all

opened at ETH in Zurich where subsamples were obtained and sent in sealed and labeled
ampoules to the other two laboratories.
Sample Processing
CEDAD Sample Processing
For each of the two coffee samples (∼5 mg), two different processing procedures were used. The
sample were either combusted without any previous chemical processing or processed
following the AAA protocol and consisting of alternate acid (HCl)-alkali (NaOH)-acid
(HCl) washings.
Sample material was then combusted to carbon dioxide at 900°C with copper oxide for 4 hr in
sealed quartz tubes. Released CO2 was cryogenically purified and then reduced to graphite at
600°C by using H2 as reducing agent and 2 mg Fe powder as catalyst (D’Elia et al. 2004). All
the samples yielded an optimal quantity of ∼1 mg of graphite which was then pressed in the
aluminum cathodes of the AMS system (3 MV TandetronTM Mod. HVEE 4130HC) for the
measurement of the isotopic ratios (Calcagnile et al. 2019). Measured 14C/12C ratios were
then corrected for mass fractionation by using the δ13C measured online with the AMS
system, and for machine and chemical processing background. Uncertainty in measured

(Calcagnile et al. 2005).
For wines, about 50 μL of liquid were sampled, heated at 60°C in quartz tubes to remove
alcohol and volatile components. The tubes were then vacuum sealed and kept at 900°C
for 4 hr to produce carbon dioxide which was then recovered, purified, converted to
graphite and measured as described above for coffee samples.

HEKAL Sample Processing
Coffee samples (∼5 mg) were combusted either without any chemical processing or after being
processed according to the AAA protocol.
About 50 μL of each wine sample was dried in a combustion tube at 70°C overnight. In this
way, all the alcohol component was removed, and the solid residue was used for the following
14C measurement.
The selected sample fractions (coffee and wine after chemical preparation) were then oxidized
at 550°C for 12 hr in sealed glass tubes by using MnO2 as catalyst. The produced CO2 was then
purified from any other by-product gases and quantified using a dedicated vacuum line
(Janovics et al. 2018). A carbon yield between 1 to 2 m/m% was measured for all the
samples. For 14C dating by AMS, graphite targets from the purified CO2 samples were
prepared using a customized sealed tube graphitization method (Rinyu et al. 2013). The 14C
measurements were performed using the EnvironMICADAS AMS instrument at HEKAL
(Synal et al. 2007; Molnár et al. 2013). The overall measurement uncertainty for modern
samples
was < 3.0‰,
including
normalization,
background
subtraction
and
counting
statistics. The 14C determinations were evaluated by the “Bats” software package (version
3.66; Wacker et al. 2010; Stuiver and Polach 1977).
ETHZ Sample Processing
One coffee sample (#1) was weighed into the aluminum cups for combustion without
treatment. Sample#2 was analyzed as untreated and after the standard ABA 60°C
treatment. Ca. 3 mg of coffee was combusted in Elemental Analyzer and transferred to
AGE system for graphitization (Wacker et al. 2010). Wine samples (ca. 2 mg) were placed
in small Q-vials and placed in preheated 9 mm diameter Vycor tubes containing CuO
wires. Tubes were subsequently placed in LN bath and after frozen evacuated and closed,
combusted at 950°C and transferred to 6 mm diameter tubes for cracker interface of
AGE3. All the samples were pressed into Al cathodes and measured together with blank
and standards using MICADAS (Synal et al. 2007). The 14C determinations were evaluated
by the “Bats” software package (version 3.66; Stuiver and Polach 1977; Wacker et al. 2010).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The radiocarbon concentrations measured for the two coffees samples are given in Table 1 as
F14C, the normalized fraction of 4C calculated as the ratio ASN/AON between the 14C/12C ratio
in the samples (ASN) and in the standard (AON) both corrected for mass fractionation (Reimer
et al. 2004). Results are summarized in Figure 1 with a quoted uncertainty of one standard
deviation for each of the three laboratories.
We can observe that the 14C concentrations measured on samples processed by the AAA
protocol and unprocessed ones give results within one standard deviation for both samples
and for the three laboratories. This is likely the result of the absence of contaminating
substances containing exogenous sources of (radio)carbon. It also suggests that for the
analysis of these types of samples an intense and time-consuming chemical processing
should not be needed.
For both the samples, all the measured values from the three laboratories overlap within one
standard deviation and average values of 1.0269 ± 0.0033 and 1.0246 ± 0.0024 can be
calculated for AAA processed sample#1 and sample#2, respectively. A similar picture is

also obtained for sample#2 when comparing the results found when no chemical processing is
applied. In this case the average value measured for the three laboratories is 1.0245 ± 0.0021.
When the results obtained on processed and unprocessed sample are averaged, a
14C
concentration of 1.0246 ± 0.0017 can be calculated for sample#2.

In order to compare the measured radiocarbon concentration with the expected age of the
coffee (2017), we used the compilation of atmospheric data valid for the Southern
Hemisphere (Hua et al. 2021). The result of the calibration procedure is shown in Figure 2.
The first intercept with the curve falls in the late 1950s and can be discarded in the present
case while the second one indicates a date in 2017 with an uncertainty of one year which is
consistent with the packing date indicated on the label.
The results obtained for the wine sample are given in Table 3 and summarized in Figure 3 for
the six samples, together with the average value and the corresponding uncertainty calculated
from the scatter of the data. It can be noted that for all the samples (except sample#1 and #2)
the values measured by the three laboratories agree within one standard deviation. For
sample#2 the larger difference is observed between the Hekal and CEDAD results but it is
still of the order of 1.3 standard deviations. For sample#1 the statistical agreement is worse
though still within two standard deviations and a more detailed discussion about the results
for this wine will be given later.
The measured radiocarbon concentrations are plotted versus the labeled production year in
Figure 4, where the atmospheric data for the Northern Hemisphere are also shown
(Hammer and Levin, 2017). Also, in this case we can observe that all the wines (again
except sample#1 dated to 2008) gave radiocarbon concentrations corresponding well to a
declining trend coherent with the expected one. It is also clear that the curve is flattening
and that it is now approaching pre-bomb levels.
For sample#1, the obtained results are somehow troublesome since the data measured by the
three laboratories show more scatter than expected and the average value is significantly lower
than the global atmospheric level in 2008. At the moment, we do not have a satisfactory
explanation for this. Possible causes for the measured 14C level include a vintage younger
than declared, a large contribution of fossil sources of carbon in the grape growing area or
the use of additives with low 14C levels. Further analyses are planned to determine the

Needs of Forensics Sciences” an intercomparison exercise was performed on roasted and
grounded coffee beans and wine samples among three AMS laboratories. The aim of the
study was to assess the achievable precision levels and demonstrate the potential uses of
14C in food authentication, which is now a major concern at the global level. The results
indicate that uncertainty level of the order of 0.3% are routinely achieved by AMS on a
single sample while multiple sample analyses results in precision down to 0.1–0.2%. A
remarkable reproducibility of the results between the different laboratories has been also
assessed on both wine and coffee samples. The measured radiocarbon concentrations for
the analyzed samples resulted to be consistent with atmospheric 14C levels in the growing
years within the uncertainty of the analyses. We also observe that the flattening of the
bomb curve results in reduced chronological resolution which is of the order of 1.5/2 years
with a confidence level of one standard deviation, for the analyzed samples and time ranges
(2008–2019). The apparently inconsistent results obtained on one of the analyzed wine
samples also demonstrates the potential of 14C analysis to highlight the possible presence of
unwanted or undeclared substances or, at least, to identify sample deserving further
attention and investigations.
