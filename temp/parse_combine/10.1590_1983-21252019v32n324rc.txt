ABSTRACT - The objective of this study was to determine the digestible phosphorus requirement in rations 
for tambaqui fingerlings (Colossoma macropomum). 900 fingerlings (0.51 ± 0.06 g) were used in a completely 
randomized design with six treatments, five replicates, and thirty fish per experimental unit. The treatments 
consisted of six diets with different digestible phosphorus levels (0.12, 0.33, 0.54, 0.75, 0.95, and 1.16%). The 
fish were fed six times a day, for 63 days. Performance, feed efficiency, and the daily protein, fat, ash, and 
phosphorus deposition rates of fish were evaluated. The treatments did not influence the feed intake. The 
elevation of phosphorus levels increased the digestible phosphorus intake linearly, and improved of quadratic 
form the weight gain, specific growth rate, feed:gain ratio, protein efficiency for weight gain, and daily protein, 
fat, ash, and phosphorus depositions up to the estimated levels of 0.64, 0.66, 0.70, 0.70, 0.62, 0.62, 0.70, 
0.71%, respectively. The phosphorus efficiency for weight gain worsened with the elevation of phosphorus 
levels. The recommendation of digestible phosphorus level in rations for tambaqui fingerlings to optimize 
weight gain and body phosphorus deposition is 0.71%, which corresponds to the estimated level of 1.04% total 
phosphorus.

EXIGÊNCIA DE FÓSFORO PARA ALEVINOS DE TAMBAQUI 
 
 
RESUMO - Objetivou-se determinar a exigência de fósforo digestível em rações para alevinos de tambaqui 
(Colossoma macropomum). Utilizou-se 900 alevinos (0,51 ± 0,06 g), em delineamento inteiramente 
casualizado, com seis tratamentos, cinco repetições, e trinta peixes por unidade experimental. Os tratamentos 
constituíram-se de seis rações com diferentes níveis de fósforo digestível (0,12; 0,33; 0,54; 0,75; 0,95; e 
1,16%). Os peixes foram alimentados seis vezes ao dia, durante 63 dias. Avaliaram-se o desempenho, 
eficiência alimentar e as deposições diárias de proteína, gordura, cinzas e fósforo corporais dos peixes. Os 
tratamentos não influenciaram no consumo de ração. A elevação dos níveis de fósforo aumentou o consumo de 
fósforo digestível de forma linear, e melhorou de forma quadrática o ganho de peso, taxa de crescimento 
específico, conversão alimentar, eficiência proteica para o ganho, e as deposições diárias de proteína, gordura, 
cinzas e fósforo até os níveis estimados de 0,64%, 0,66%, 0,70%, 0,70%, 0,62%; 0,62%; 0,70%; 0,71%, 
respectivamente. A eficiência de fósforo para o ganho de peso piorou com a elevação dos níveis de fósforo. A 
recomendação dos níveis de fósforo digestível em rações para alevinos de tambaqui, visando otimizar o 
desempenho e a deposição corporal de fósforo, é de 0,71%, correspondendo ao nível de 1,04% de fósforo total.

PHOSPHORUS REQUIREMENT OF TAMBAQUI FINGERLINGS

INTRODUCTION 
 
Phosphorus is one of the most important 
minerals in animal nutrition, required by all 
vertebrates for growth, reproduction, bone formation, 
and the metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates 
and 
fats 
(QUINTERO-PINTO 
et 
al., 
2011; 
SANTOS, 2012; ARAÚJO et al., 2017). Although 
fish absorb many essential minerals directly from the 
aquatic environment, the greater part of the required 
phosphorus must be obtained in the diet, as the 
absorption of phosphorous directly from the water is 
very 
low, 
which 
indicates 
the 
need 
for 
supplementation of this mineral in the diet (NRC, 
2011; BOMFIM, 2013; CHEN et al., 2017). 
When the levels of phosphorus in the diet are 
below the nutritional requirement, the animal’s 
performance is impaired. Inadequate phosphorous 
intake causes changes in intestinal villi and bone 
mineralization, and may reduce the amino acid 
efficiency of body protein deposition in fish and, 
consequently, increase the discharge of nitrogen to 
the environment. However, when dietary phosphorus 
supplementation meets the nutritional requirement, 
fish show an increase in protein utilization, bone 
mineralization, 
and 
reduction 
in 
lipid 
body 
deposition 
(QUINTERO-PINTO 
et 
al., 
2011; 
SANTOS, 2012; ZAFAR; KHAN, 2018). 
When phosphorus levels in the ration are 
excessive, the efficiency of its use decreases 
considerably, increasing its excretion into the 
environment and contributing to the eutrophication 
of the aquatic environment. Because of this, it is 
necessary to adjust the dietary concentration of the 
element to strictly meet, but not exceed, nutritional 
requirements (FURUYA et al., 2010; TANG et al., 
2012; MUSHARRAF; KHAN, 2019). 
Fish ration formulations include phosphorus 
in different concentrations, forms, and availability or 
digestibility (QUINTERO-PINTO et al., 2011; 
SANTOS, 2012). In ingredients of plant origin, 50-
80% of the phosphorus content is associated with 
phytate, which is unavailable to fish because they 
lack endogenous phytase production (CAO et al., 
2007). 
Owing to their productivity and marketability, 
tambaqui is the most cultivated fish species in the 
State of Maranhão, with a production of 10,501 
thousand tons (11.8% of national production) in 
2017 (IBGE 2019; BUZOLLO et al., 2019). 
However, there is a lack of information regarding 
tambaqui nutritional requirements, as highlighted in 
recent reviews by Dairiki and Silva (2011) and 
Oliveira, Miranda and Correa (2013). There is a 
shortage of research papers published in specialized 
journals regarding the dietary recommendations of 
phosphorus levels in rations for tambaqui. 
Considering the lack of information regarding 
phosphorus requirements in tambaqui rations and 
that the dietary requirements of the mineral vary 
across tambaqui breeding phases, the objective of 
this study was to determine the requirement of 
digestible phosphorus in rations for tambaqui 
(Colossoma macropomum) fingerlings. 
 
 
MATERIAL AND METHODS 
 
The experiment was conducted according to 
the ethical standards of animal research, after being 
approved by the Ethics Committee on Animal Use of 
the Federal University of Maranhão (Protocol Nº: 
23115008833/2014-31). The research was carried 
out in the Food and Nutrition Laboratory of Aquatic 
Organisms 
of 
the 
Center 
of 
Agrarian 
and 
Environmental Sciences of the Federal University of 
Maranhão (UFMA), in Chapadinha, Maranhão, with 
a duration of 63 days. 
900 tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) 
fingerlings were used with initial average weights of 
0.51 ± 0.06 g, in a completely randomized design, 
consisting of six treatments, five replicates, and 
thirty fish per experimental unit. 
The treatments consisted of six isoprotein, 
isoenergetic, and isocalcium diets, with different 
digestible phosphorus levels (0.12, 0.33, 0.54, 0.75, 
0.95, 1.16%) (Table 1). The digestible phosphorus 
levels were determined based on the digestibility 
coefficients of corn, soybean meal and dicalcium 
phosphate recommended for Nile tilapia by Furuya 
et al. (2010). The levels of crude protein, methionine 
plus cystine:lysine, and threonine:lysine were fixed, 
based on the values recommended by Lima (2013) 
and Souza (2014) for tambaqui, and by Takishita 
(2012) for Nile tilapia, respectively. For the other 
nutritional levels, we used the values recommended 
for Nile tilapia per NRC (2011). 
In 
the 
pre-experimental 
period, 
which 
consisted of one week, the fish were stored in the 
experimental facilities and fed with commercial 
ration to adapt for the experimental conditions. In the 
experimental period, the fish were kept in 30 
polyethylene boxes (aquarium) with capacity of 500 
liters in a closed water circulation system, with a 
supply system, additional aeration and individual 
drainage. 
The water supply came from artesian well and 
the cleaning of the boxes was carried out daily by 
siphoning, always after the water temperature 
monitoring, which was performed daily at 7:30 and 
17:30 hours, with the aid of a mercury bulb 
thermometer, graduated from 0 to 50ºC. Control of 
pH, dissolved oxygen content and ammonia in the 
water were monitored every seven days, using a pH 
meter, oximeter and commercial kit for testing 
ammonia toxicity, respectively.

The ingredients of the experimental rations 
were 
mixed, 
moistened in 
water heated to 
approximately 50 °C, and pelletized using a meat 
grinder. Then the rations were dried, crushed, and 
sieved to obtain pellets of 3 mm in diameter.  
The rations were offered six times a day 
(08:00, 10:00, 12:00, 14:00, 16:00, and 18:00 h). At 
every meal, the rations were offered in small 
quantities, with successive offerings until apparent 
satiation, thereby avoiding the over or under delivery 
of feed. 
At the beginning of the experiment, 50 fish 
were stunned, euthanized in ice water, and frozen. At 
the end of experiment, after 24-hour fasting, all fish 
in each tank were weighed, stunned, and euthanized. 
Subsequently, the final biometry of the fish and the 
feed consumption per experimental unit were 
evaluated. 
The fish samples (initial and final per 
experimental plot) were identified, dried in a 
greenhouse 
with 
forced 
air 
circulation, 
pre-
degreased, ground in a ball mill, and packed in 
containers for further laboratory analysis. The 
carcasses and rations were analyzed for their 
composition (moisture, protein, fat, ash, and 
phosphorus content) according to the procedures 
described by Detmann et al. (2012). The laboratory 
analyses were carried out at the Animal Nutrition 
Laboratories of the Federal University of Maranhão - 
UFMA and Animal Nutrition of the Federal 
University of Piauí - UFPI. 
At the end of the experiment, the following 
indices of performance and food efficiency were 
evaluated: 
feed 
intake 
(FI), 
consumption 
of 
digestible phosphorus (CDPH), weight gain (WG), 
specific growth rate (SGR), feed:gain ratio (FGR), 
protein efficiency for weight gain (PEWG), and 
phosphorus efficiency for weight gain (PHEWG). 
These were calculated according to the following 
equations:

In addition, the rates of the daily body 
depositions of protein (BDP), fat (BDF), phosphorus 
(BDPH), and ash (BDA) were calculated according  
to the methodologies described by Bomfim et al. 
(2010) and Ribeiro et al. (2006), according to the 
equations below:  
FI  g  = Ration consumed during the experimental period

Statistical analyses were performed using 
SAS 9.0 software (2002). Data were submitted to 
analysis of variance at five percent probability level. 
For the variables that showed significant effects of 
digestible phosphorus levels by analysis of variance, 
regression analyses were performed using linear and 
quadratic 
models. 
We 
also 
evaluated 
the 
discontinuous 
model 
"Linear 
Response 
Plateau" (LRP). In choosing the best fit model, the 
value of P (significance) and R2 (Sum of squares of 
the model /Sum of treatment squares) were taken 
into account. 
 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
During the whole experimental period there 
was only 1% mortality, which was not related to the 
treatments. 
The 
maximum 
and 
minimum 
temperatures of the water were 26.5 ± 0.61 °C and 
24.8 ± 0.70 °C, respectively. The concentration of 
dissolved oxygen in the water was 7.35 ± 0.80 ppm, 
pH 6.0 ± 0.40 and total ammonia ≤ 1.00 ppm. The 
physical-chemical parameters of the water were kept 
within the recommended standards for rearing 
tambaqui fingerlings throughout the experimental 
period, as recommended by Gomes et al. (2010) and 
Mendonça et al. (2012). It was observed that feed 
intake did not vary (P>0.05) as a function of 
treatments. As the feed contained different levels of 
digestible phosphorus, the digestible phosphorus 
consumption was influenced (P<0.01) by the 
treatments, increasing linearly with the elevation of 
digestible phosphorus levels in the ration (Tables 2 
and 3). 
Considering that the consumption of ration 
and, consequently, of energy and other nutrients in 
the ration did not vary between the evaluated levels, 
and that the consumption of digestible phosphorus 
increased linearly with the increase of the content of 
this mineral in the ration, it can be inferred that the 
significant effects in other variables evaluated were 
caused by the difference in consumption of digestible 
phosphorus.

The effects of dietary phosphorus level 
variations on fish feed intake do not follow a specific 
response pattern. The effects observed in this study 
were similar to those observed by Oliva-Teles and 
Pimentel-Rodrigues (2004) in studies of European 
sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), which also showed 
no variation in feed intake between fish fed diets 
containing 0.48; 0.65; 0.77; 0.86; 1.05 and 1.25% 
total phosphorus (DM base). Previously, Pezzato et 
al. (2006) observed a linear increase in feed intake of 
tilapia 
fingerlings 
as 
a 
function 
of 
dietary 
phosphorus supplementation. Furuya et al. (2008) 
observed a quadratic effect in feed intake as a 
function of the variation of four levels of available 
phosphorus (0.25, 0.35, 0.45 and 0.55%) in the diets 
of juvenile Nile tilapia. 
Regarding weight gain and specific growth 
rate, the model that best fit the results as a function 
of the elevation of digestible phosphorus levels was 
quadratic (P<0.01 and P<0.05, respectively), which 
indicated an increase in these variables to the 
estimated digestible phosphorous level of 0.64% 
(Figure 1) and 0.66%, respectively (Tables 2 and 3).

The results obtained for the weight gain differ 
from those observed in studies performed by 
Miranda et al. (2000) and Ribeiro (2006), who did 
not find significant variation in the weight gain of 
Nile tilapia fingerlings when they evaluated 
phosphorus levels, probably because the observed 
levels were not limiting. On the other hand, similar 
effects were reported by Pezzato et al. (2006) when 
they evaluated five diets with increasing available 
phosphorus levels (0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, and 
1.25%) for Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), by 
Furuya et al. (2008) when they evaluated the effect 
of different available phosphorus levels (0.25, 0.35, 
0.45, and 0.55%) for the same species, and by Sousa 
et al. (2018) when they evaluated different digestible 
phosphorus levels (0.27, 0.46, 0.67, 0.91, 1.04, and 
1.14%) for tambaqui fingerlings. 
An increase in weight gain was observed until 
the estimated digestible phosphorus level reached 
0.64%, associated with consumption of similar feed 
and a linear increase in phosphorus consumption, 
implying an improvement of feed:gain ratio. This 
indicates that increased phosphorus in the diet 
promoted an improvement in the use of nutrients,

especially for protein deposition, as lean tissue 
deposition (protein) is more energy efficient than fat 
deposition because protein incorporates more water 
in its composition (NOBLET et al., 2001; BOMFIM 
et al., 2010; SOUSA et al., 2018; MUSHARRAF; 
KHAN, 2019), thus minimizing the excretion of 
nitrogenous residues to the environment (BOMFIM 
2013). 
The elevation of digestible phosphorus levels 
produced a quadratic effect on feed:gain ratio 
(P<0.05) and the protein efficiency of weight gain, 
increasing these variables until the estimated 
digestible 
phosphorus 
level 
reached 
0.70%. 
However, the phosphorus efficiency for weight gain 
decreased (P<0.05) in a quadratic manner as a result 
of the increase of this mineral content.

Figure 1. Graphical representation of weight gain for tambaqui fingerlings as a function of digestible phosphorus level of 
the ration.  
Furuya et al. (2008) observed a similar effect 
on Nile tilapia (35 to 100 g) feed:gain ratio when 
evaluating different available phosphorus levels, 
estimating the best result for this variable at available 
phosphorus level of 0.48%. In the same work, the 
protein efficiency rate had a different effect than was 
observed in this study, increasing quadratically. 
One hypothesis that may explain this 
reduction in phosphorus efficiency for weight gain is 
that the increase of phosphorus in the ration causes 
the absorption efficiency of this mineral to decrease, 
probably owing to the inactivation of the mechanism 
for active transport of phosphorus, which increases 
the fecal loss of potentially digestible phosphorus, as 
demonstrated by TANG et al. (2012). 
The daily body deposition of protein, fat, 
phosphorus, and ash was influenced quadratically 
(P<0.05, P<0.05, P<0.01, P<0.05, respectively) by 
increased levels of digestible phosphorus, raising 
these variables until the estimated digestible 
phosphorous levels of 0.62, 0.62, 0.71 (Figure 2), 
and 0.70%, respectively (Tables 4 and 5).

Daily 
phosphorus 
and 
ash 
deposition 
improved as phosphorus was added to diets. These 
increases are explained by the fact that phosphorus is 
an essential component of an animal's body structure. 
It is essential for the formation of bones (about 37% 
of the bone composition corresponds to calcium and 
16% to phosphorus). In addition, it is involved in the 
formation of cell membranes and phosphoproteins, 
energy transfer, regulation of acid-base balance, and 
in enzymatic and hormonal systems involved in 
amino acid, carbohydrate and fat metabolism, 
corroborating the improvement in protein deposition 
rates and fat (BÜNZEN, 2012; SANTOS, 2012; XIE 
et al., 2017).

Figure 2. Graphic representation of the daily body phosphorus deposition of tambaqui fingerlings as a function of the 
digestible phosphorus level of the ration.  
A reduction in daily fat deposition was 
observed with the inclusion of 0.75% of digestible 
phosphorus in the ration. The reduction in body fat 
deposition in fish with increased dietary phosphorus 
content was also observed by Rocha et al. (2010) in 
kingfish (Odontesthes argentinensis), by Mai et al. 
(2006) in yellow croaker (Pseudosciaena crocea) 
and by Zhang et al. (2006) in Japanese sea bass 
(Lateolabrax japonicus). 
One hypothesis that may explain the reduction 
in body fat deposition that results from the inclusion 
of 0.75% of digestible phosphorus in the diet is that 
this level of phosphorous favors the energetic 
metabolism 
of 
fatty 
acids 
(β-oxidation), 
as 
phosphorus is the main constituent of the adenosine 
triphosphate molecule (ATP), which plays an 
important role in the transfer of energy and in the 
activation of some regulatory enzymes in this 
metabolism.

Weight gain has been the main criterion for 
determining the requirement of a given nutrient by 
the dose response method (NRC, 2011). To 
determine the requirement of phosphorus, in addition 
to weight gain, another parameter that can be used is 
deposition of body phosphorus (SAKOMURA; 
ROSTAGNO, 2007; ABIMORAD et al., 2010; 
NRC, 2011). In this sense, the recommendation of 
levels of digestible phosphorus in rations for 
tambaqui fingerlings that optimizes weight gain and 
body phosphorus deposition is 0.71%, which 
corresponds to the estimated level of 1.04% total 
phosphorus.

fish species found in the literature present varied 
results, some less than that determined in this study, 
as is the case in Diemer et al. (2014), who 
recommend 0.60% total phosphorus for pacu 
fingerlings, 
an 
omnivorous 
species 
with 
morphometric and ecological characteristics similar 
to tambaqui. Boscolo et al. (2005), recommends 
0.75% total phosphorus, as it provides better 
performance in bone mineralization and performance 
of Nile tilapia fingerlings. This variation can be 
explained by the fact that different species can have 
distinct digestive systems, physiology, and growth 
rates (GONÇALVES et al., 2009; BOMFIM et al., 
2010; TAKISHITA, 2012). 
Optimal nutritional levels similar to those 
obtained in this study were determined for Nile 
tilapia fingerlings by Pezzato et al. (2006), in 
digestible values, and by Ribeiro et al. (2006), in 
total values, while ARAÚJO et al., (2017) 
determined similar levels, in digestible values, for 
tambaqui juveniles. 
 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
The 
recommendation 
of 
digestible 
phosphorus level in rations for tambaqui fingerlings 
to optimize weight gain and body phosphorus 
deposition is 0.71%, which corresponds to the 
estimated level of 1.04% total phosphorus.
