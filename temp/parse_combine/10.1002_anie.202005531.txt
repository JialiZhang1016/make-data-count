TITLE  front  59  2020  0  Trifluoromethyl Sulfoxides: Reagents for MetalâFree CâH Trifluoromethylthiolation   ABSTRACT  abstract_title_1  86  Abstract   ABSTRACT  abstract  95  Trifluoromethyl sulfoxides are a new class of trifluoromethylthiolating reagent. The sulfoxides engage in metalâfree CâH trifluoromethylthiolation with a range of (hetero)arenes. The method is also applicable to the functionalization of important compound classes, such as ligand derivatives and polyaromatics, and in the lateâstage trifluoromethylthiolation of medicines and agrochemicals. The isolation and characterization of a sulfonium salt intermediate supports an interrupted Pummerer reaction mechanism.   ABSTRACT  abstract  613  May I interrupt? Taking advantage of the interrupted Pummerer reaction, trifluoromethyl sulfoxides engage in the metalâfree CâH trifluoromethylthiolation of (hetero)arenes, including drug molecules and natural products. This new class of trifluoromethylthiolating reagent exploits a new strategy for trifluoromethylthiolation in which sulfonium salts are assembled and selectively deconstructed.   INTRO  paragraph  1015  Incorporating fluorine into organic compounds is a useful tool in drug design and development. The fluoro group is well known to improve the pharmacokinetic properties of a molecule and fluorineâ18 is an important radioisotope in molecular imaging.1, 2 Trifluoromethylthio (SCF3) groups are commonly found in drug molecules and veterinary medicines.3, 4 By combining a fluorinated moiety with a heteroatom, many have turned to the SCF3 group to impart useful properties, such as high lipophilicity, to a compound of interest.5   INTRO  paragraph  1545  An attractive route for incorporating SCF3 groups into organic molecules is through the direct, metalâfree functionalization of CâH bonds.6 Early methods using trifluoromethylsulfenyl chloride have fallen from favor because of concerns over handling and toxicity of the reagent.7 This triggered a push to develop shelfâstable, easyâtoâhandle trifluoromethylthiolating agents (Schemeâ 1âA).8 Despite the advantages of these reagents, they are generally limited to the CâH trifluoromethylthiolation of highly electronârich (hetero)arenes, such as indoles and phenols, whereas reactions involving less nucleophilic arenes, such as anisole and toluene, are scarce.8a, 8b, 8d, 8o, 8p Furthermore, few reports describe the use of these reagents for the lateâstage trifluoromethylthiolation of complex molecules.8a, 8b, 8j, 8m, 8n   ANIE-59-15918-g001.jpg  anie202005531-fig-5001  FIG  fig_caption  2389  A)â Current methods for transition metalâfree CâH trifluoromethylthiolation. B)â This work: CâH trifluoromethylthiolation by an interrupted Pummerer reaction.   INTRO  paragraph  2556  In recent years, our group9 and others10 have explored the soâcalled interrupted Pummerer reaction of sulfoxides and its use for the functionalization of CâH bonds.11 For example, we have described the thioarylation of simple arenes using sulfoxides as sulfide precursors.9c Key to these reactions is the in situ formation of a highly electrophilic sulfonium salt, by activation of the sulfoxide with an acid anhydride, which is susceptible to reaction with a range of nucleophiles.   INTRO  paragraph  3043  We were keen to assess whether underutilized trifluoromethyl sulfoxides would engage in CâH trifluoromethylthiolation. We reasoned that trifluoromethylsulfonium salts, generated from trifluoromethyl sulfoxides by an interrupted Pummerer reaction, would prove versatile intermediates en route to the incorporation of SCF3 into nucleophilic arenes. Herein, we present trifluoromethyl sulfoxides as novel, tuneable trifluoromethylthiolating agents (Schemeâ 1âB). The easy to prepare, benchâstable and novel trifluoromethyl sulfoxides12 allow SCF3 incorporation into a variety of heteroarenes and arenes, including drug molecules, at the expense of CâH bonds. In contrast to current methods for trifluoromethylthiolation, which involve direct attack of an arene on an electrophilic SCF3 reagent, our unique strategy builds the desired connectivity to give sulfonium salts that are selectively deconstructed in situ to deliver trifluoromethylthiolated products.   INTRO  paragraph  4009  Our first aim was to design and synthesize a sulfoxide suitable for general and selective trifluoromethylthiolation.13 Key to our mechanistic hypothesis for trifluoromethylthiolation is the selective loss of the R group, rather than the CF3 group, from the sulfoxide 1 (Schemeâ 1âB). As this step likely occurs by nucleophilic substitution in a sulfonium salt intermediate (see below), we identified the benzylâsubstituted trifluoromethyl sulfoxide 1âa as a candidate for enabling trifluoromethylthiolation: the activating effect of the adjacent Ïâsystem, combined with the inhibitory effect of fluoro groups towards incoming nucleophiles,14 would make the benzyl group more susceptible to removal. We developed a new route for the synthesis of 1âa, which was obtained as a freeâflowing, benchâstable, crystalline solid and has been characterized by Xâray crystallographic analysis (Schemeâ 1âB).15   INTRO  paragraph  4930  With a novel sulfoxide in hand, we attempted the trifluoromethylthiolation of indole (2âa; Schemeâ 2). The sulfoxide was activated using triflic anhydride9 to give the desired trifluoromethylthiolated indole 3âa in 70â% yield. The reaction tolerated substitution at all positions around the indole motif [C4 (3âb, 3âf, 3âh), C5 (3âd, 3âe, 3âi), C6 (3âc, 3âg), C7 (3âj) and C3 (3âk)], including various electronâwithdrawing (3âbâg) and electronâdonating (3âiâk) groups. We were pleased to find that functional groups that can undergo subsequent transformations, such as halides (3âb, 3âc), nitriles (3âd), esters (3âeâ3âg), and boronate esters (3âh), were well tolerated. Nâmethyl indoles also worked well in the procedure (3âlân). A range of other heteroaromatic compounds also underwent efficient CâH trifluoromethylthiolation, such as benzothiophene (3âo), thiophenes (3âp, 3âq), benzofuran (3âr) and pyrroles (3âs, 3ât). The reaction was also executed on a gram scale without severe detriment to the yield (3âa).

[b]â Reaction run on a gram scale. [c]â Numbers within parenthesis indicate ratio of C2 versus C3 trifluoromethylthiolation.   INTRO  paragraph  6441  In comparison to heteroarenes, the trifluoromethylthiolation of arenes has received less attention.8a, 8b, 8d, 8o, 8p Initial results using 1âa gave poor yields of the desired trifluoromethylthiolated arenes, however, a novel esterâderived trifluoromethyl sulfoxide, 1âb, showed good reactivity (Schemeâ 3). This outcome suggests that the structure of the sulfoxide can be tuned for optimization with a specific class of substrate.16 With 1âb, anisole, phenol and other alkylated arenes were responsive to trifluoromethylthiolation (5âaâe).17 Unfortunately, free amines were not tolerated in this reaction (5âf).18 A range of 1,2â (5âgâj) 1,3â (5âk) and 1,4âdisubstituted (5âl, 5âm) arenes, bearing various functionalities, such as halogens and esters, also performed well under our reaction conditions. The reaction was also applicable to trisubstituted arenes (5ân, 5âo) and naphthalenes (5âp, 5âq). Finally, we showcased our method using substrates relevant in catalysis, materials, medicine, and agriculture. We were able to trifluoromethylthiolate a BINOL derivative (5âr), pyrene (5âs), drugs (5ât), pesticides (5âu), and a natural product derivative (5âv).

[f]â Numbers within parenthesis indicate ratio of C1 versus C2 trifluoromethylthiolation. The major regioisomer is shown.   INTRO  paragraph  8469  A mechanistic proposal for the trifluoromethylthiolation is summarized in Schemeâ 4. The trifluoromethyl sulfoxides 1 are initially activated through reaction with Tf2O to produce the electrophilic intermediates 6. The intermediates 6 then undergo the soâcalled interrupted Pummerer reaction with a (hetero)arene (e.g. 4) to give the sulfonium salts 7. Selective removal of the R group by Et2NH reveals the trifluoromethylthiolated products (e.g. 5). Experimental and computational studies provided support for our proposed mechanism. Firstly, the sulfonium salt 7âm was isolated from the reaction between pâxylene (4âm) and 1âb.15, 19 We then modelled the dealkylation step using DFT calculations. These results showed that the transition state for attack of the amine (Et2NH) at the âCH2CO2Et group lies 40.8â kJâmolâ1 lower in energy than the transition state for attack at the âCF3 group. In addition, the expected sideâproduct, Et2NCH2CO2Et (8), was detected by GCMS. It is likely that attack at the âCF3 group is disfavored because of unfavorable electrostatic interactions,14 though further studies are required to fully delineate the intricacies of this mechanism. These studies highlight our unique strategy for trifluoromethylthiolation; whereas current methods proceed through direct attack of an arene on an electrophilic SCF3 reagent,8 we have introduced alternative reactivity in which the desired connectivity is built, to give 7, before inducing controlled deconstruction and release of the desired trifluoromethylthiolated products.

B)â Computational investigation of the chemoselective dealkylation. [a]â The process was modelled using the cation of 7âm. See the Supporting Information for further details.   INTRO  paragraph  10316  In summary, we have developed a new strategy for the metalâfree CâH trifluoromethylthiolation of (hetero)arenes. In this process, we utilize the interrupted Pummerer reaction to establish trifluoromethyl sulfoxides as novel trifluoromethylthiolating agents. Our method for incorporating SCF3 components exploits a buildâup/deconstruct strategy and is mechanistically distinct from current processes. A variety of (hetero)aromatic compounds underwent efficient trifluoromethylthiolation, including drug molecules and natural products. We expect trifluoromethyl sulfoxides to find application in other trifluoromethylthiolation reactions in the future.

REF  ref  11768  See the Supporting Information for details of the optimization. When reacting the indole 2âl with 1âb, product 3âl was formed in 17â% yield. When reacting the arene 4âm with 1âa, product 5âm was formed in 7â% yield. This suggests that less nucleophilic arenes (4) require the presumably more electrophilic sulfoxide 1âb to react. However, further studies are required to fully understand the differing reactivity.   REF  ref  12200  The reaction with benzene gave only a trace amount of product.   REF  ref  12263  Preliminary results suggest that some amines, for example, NPh3, are tolerated. See the Supporting Information.   65  20703379  REF  Beilstein J. Org. Chem.  ref  6  2010  12375
