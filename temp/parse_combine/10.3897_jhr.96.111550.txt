Abstract
Recent field surveys in the eastern Canary Islands (Spain), followed by contributions of new occurrence records 
through the citizen science platform iNaturalist.com and the social media photo repository Flickr.com have 
revealed the presence of an overlooked small carder bee species (genus Pseudoanthidium Friese (Megachilidae: 
Anthidiini)) on the islands of Lanzarote and Fuerteventura. Here, we combined morphology, DNA barcodes 
(mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, COI) and ecological data (distribution, altitudinal ranges and 
environmental niche classification) to describe this species as Pseudoanthidium (Pseudoanthidium) jacobii sp. 
nov. We provide an illustrated description along with diagnostic morphological characters to separate it from 
P. (P.) canariense (Mavromoustakis, 1954), the only other congeneric species known from the neighbouring 
islands of La Gomera, Tenerife and Gran Canaria and from which it is separated by a genetic distance of 2.7%. 
We also evaluated the extent of shared environmental niche space among the two Pseudoanthidium species, 
and our results show a significant difference in elevation range as well as a very small (less than 1%) overlap 
between the modelled climatic niche of P. jacobii and that of P. canariense. Given the extremely restricted 
geographic distribution and the fragile and isolated nature of the habitat and host plants of this new island 
endemic species, we assign it an IUCN conservation status of “EN” (endangered) and discuss avenues for 
future research on the ecology and conservation of wild bees in the Canary Islands and neighbouring regions.

Introduction
Within Macaronesia and its oceanic islands, the Canary Islands (CI) archipelago en-
compasses seven islands with contrasting climates, topography, and geological history. 
Among the many fascinating facets of the CI archipelago for the island biogeographer 
is the diversity of environmental conditions, as well as the ecological and geological 
gradients observed within and among the islands. The CI are a well-known hotspot 
of biological endemism ever since Von Humboldt’s first visit in 1799, for both plants 
and animals (Kunkel 1976; Fernández-Palacios et al. 2004; Fernández-Palacios and 
Whittaker 2008; Bowler 2018): to some naturalists, including the entomologist WM 
Wheeler, author of a review on the ants of the CI in the early 20th century, the Canar-
ies “bear much the same relation to the south Palearctic fauna that [...] the Galapagos 
bear to those of South and Central America” (Wheeler 1927). The CI have long been 
a popular destination for European entomologists, including lepidopterists who by the 
end of the 19th century had already listed all butterfly species inhabiting the archipel-
ago (Wiemers 1995 and references therein). Likewise, coleopterists have investigated 
the fauna of the archipelago for decades, including in some relict communities of 
laurel forest (Laurisilva) and thermophilous vegetation on the island of Fuerteventura 
(Machado 1976).
By contrast, historical surveys across the CI by hymenopterists (except myrmecolo-
gists), have lagged behind for decades. Although there are early reports on wild bees 
tracing back to the early 20th century, it was not until 1993 that the first comprehensive 
and annotated catalogue of the 127 species and subspecies of wild bees (of which 38% 
are strict CI endemics) was published (Hohmann et al. 1993), at a time when most Eu-
ropean regions and countries still lacked species checklists. The availability of this 1993 
“baseline” represents a cornerstone piece of information, as well as one of the pillars of 
contemporary research, and it has stimulated more surveys in the CI and the collection 
of biological occurrence records by Canarian and continental European entomologists 
ever since (Tkalçů 1993, 2001a, 2001b; Kuhlmann 2000; Dupont and Skov 2004; 
Pesenko and Pauly 2005; Smit 2007; Pérez and Marcías-Hernández 2012; Suarez et al. 
2017; Kratochwil and Schwabe 2018, 2020; Kratochwil 2020). This, along with the 
development of citizen science projects (iNaturalist.com 2023) and standardised field 
surveys by and with local institutions, has radically improved our knowledge on the 
biodiversity and biogeography of wild bees in the CI archipelago.
Despite these advances, it is clear that gaps in our knowledge on CI bees are per-
sistent, as demonstrated by the new island records of native species (Jacobi and Suárez 
2018), or recent reports on exotic species reaching the archipelago (Pérez and Hernán-
dez 2012; Ortiz et al. 2016; Strudwick and Jacobi 2018; Ruiz et al. 2020; Lugo et al.

2022). Even locally intensive surveys on the most species-rich islands are likely still 
incomplete and have missed a certain number of species, opening the door for new 
discoveries. Photographs posted on online platforms such as iNaturalist.com or obser-
vations.org, as well as on Flickr.com and other similar online repositories, have recently 
served as the first evidence of new species in other parts of the world (Jaiswara et al. 
2022; Masson Rosa et al. 2022; Zhang et al. 2022). These online portals represent an 
important new source of biological records for bees and other organisms, and an effec-
tive tool to engage anyone willing to produce new observations, armed with a camera, 
a little luck and some time spent in the field.
Here, we report on the results of recent field surveys focusing on wild bees in the 
CI archipelago, followed by observations shared through the citizen science platform 
iNaturalist.com and the social media photo repository Flickr.com. By combining de-
tailed morphological analysis, DNA barcodes (mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 
subunit I, COI) and ecological data (distribution, altitudinal ranges and environmental 
niche classification), we concluded that specimens of a solitary bee belonging to the 
genus Pseudoanthidium (Megachilidae, Anthidiini) collected and photographed in situ 
in Lanzarote and Fuerteventura on multiple occasions in recent years, represents a 
hitherto unknown species of small carder bee that we describe below.
Materials and methods
Specimen collection and preparation, collection of occurrence records
As part of an ongoing collaboration between the Université libre de Bruxelles (NJV, 
LM, JMM) and the Departamento Biología Animal, Edafología y Geología of the 
University of La Laguna (CR) on apple tree pollinators, as well as the biogeography of 
the Canary Islands bees and the development of new taxonomic tools on the bees of 
Europe, field surveys have been conducted on the islands of Tenerife, Fuerteventura 
and Lanzarote in April 2021.
On 18.iv.2021, a male Pseudoanthidium was photographed by NJV (Fig. 1A, B) 
and collected with a hand net at Haría (Lanzarote); a female was collected with a hand 
net at the same site on the same day by JMM. The following day, on 19.iv.2021, two 
male Pseudoanthidium specimens were collected at Teguise (Lanzarote). All specimens 
were first assumed to be new island records of P. canariense, until a closer examination 
of pinned specimens under the microscope challenged this view. The type specimens 
curated at the ULB Agroecology Lab entomological collection (Brussels, Belgium) will 
be transferred to the DZUL entomological collection curated by CR at the University 
of La Laguna (Tenerife) upon the publication of this manuscript.
On 12.ii.2023, a female Pseudoanthidium was photographed at Bco. Valle del 
Palomo (Lanzarote) by MPG, and two female specimens were collected by MPG at 
Haría (Lanzarote), one on 21.ii.2023 (Bco. Valle del Palomo), and another one on 
16.iv.2023 (Bco. de Elvira Sánchez). These specimens were sent to CR to be pinned, 
Nicolas J. Vereecken et al.  /  Journal of Hymenoptera Research 96: 983–1015 (2023)
986
prepared for identification and deposited at the entomological collection curated by 
CR at the University of La Laguna (Tenerife). On 19.iv.2023, CR collected one female 
Pseudoanthidium species at Bco. de Elvira Sánchez (Haría, Lanzarote) now included in 
the DZUL entomological collection at the University of La Laguna (Tenerife). Public-
ly available occurrence data on wild bees across the Canary Islands reveal a significant 
disparity in sampling (GBIF 2023a): Tenerife (3,211 records), Gran Canaria (787), La 
Palma (560), Lanzarote (449), La Gomera, (383), Fuerteventura (263) and El Hierro 
(16). These figures are consistent with the historical patterns published by Hohmann 
et al. (1993). As a result, although additional collection efforts are needed across the 
entire island group, we can reasonably conclude that the range of the new Pseudoanth-
idium species does not include Gran Canaria and Tenerife.
On 12.iii.2023 and on 16.iii.2023, two female Pseudoanthidium specimens were 
photographed by BJ at Mácher (Lanzarote) (Fig. 1C, D).
Finally, G. Peña Tejera notified CR of another observation made and published on 
Flickr.com on 7.iii.2020 at Betancuria (Fuerteventura) by photographer L. Mullins.
DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing of COI 
sequences
DNA extractions were performed on single legs from one male and one female speci-
men of this new species using Nucleospin tissue DNA extraction kits (Macherey - 
Nagel). A 658 base pair fragment of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase 
(CO1) was amplified using the primers Lep-F1 and Lep-R1 under the PCR conditions 
described in Hebert et al. (2004). PCR products were purified using a combination 
of exonuclease and FastAP thermosensitive alkaline phosphatase (Fermentas) and se-
quencing was performed using the same primers as those used for PCR reactions.
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis of CO1
Sequences were edited using Geneious (Kearse et al. 2012) and aligned with eight oth-
er CO1 sequences representing the closely related species Pseudoanthidium canariense 
(Mavromoustakis, 1954), P. scapulare (Latreille, 1809), P. nanum (Mocsáry, 1880), 
P. palestinicum (Mavromoustakis, 1938), P. tenellum (Mocsáry, 1880), P. cribratum 
(Morawitz, 1875) and P. stigmaticorne (Dours, 1873), as well as the more distantly 
related P. reticulatum (Mocsáry, 1884) as an outgroup (see Suppl. material 1 for taxon 
list). Alignments were performed using MAFFT v7.520 (Katoh and Standley 2013) 
and were verified visually using Mesquite v3.81 (Maddison and Maddison 2023). Data 
were divided into two partitions, with first and third codon positions in one parti-
tion and second codon positions in another. Model testing and maximum likelihood 
analyses were performed using the IQTree web server (Trifinopoulos et al. 2016). One 
thousand bootstrap replicates were performed on the partitioned dataset using the 
models TIM2+F+I (first and third codon positions) and HKY+F+G4 (second codon 
positions). Calculations of genetic distance were performed under a K2P model using 
Mesquite v3.81 (Maddison and Maddison 2023).

Morphological diagnosis
The morphological terminology used in the description follows Michener (2007), Lit-
man et al. (2021), Niu et al. (2021) as well as Kasparek and Ebmer (2023). All absolute 
measurements are made in millimetres (mm) and are used for body length. For all 
other structures, relative measurements are used. Abbreviations used in the description 
and diagnosis section below are as follows:
BL	
(body length): measured as the shortest absolute distance from the base of 
the antennal socket to the apex of the metasoma (see Niu et al. 2021);
ITD	
(inter-tegular distance): measured as the shortest absolute distance between 
the tegulae (scale-like structure covering the insertion point of the wings on 
the thorax) in dorsal view;
OOD	
(ocellar-occiput distance): assessed in dorsal view, under a stereomicroscope 
with continuous LED light, as a ratio between the distance separating the 
lateral ocelli and the posterior occiput (dorsal margin of the vertex) on one 
hand, and the ocellar diameter on the other hand;
MPD	
(median punctuation density): assessed as the ratio between the distance 
separating neighbouring points in the median region of the tergites and the 
puncture diameter;
LPD	
(lateral punctuation density): measured as the ratio between the distance sep-
arating neighbouring points in the lateral region of the tergites, particularly 
on T2 (second tergite) and T3 (third tergite), and the puncture diameter;
SSPD	
(scutum and scutellum punctuation density): measured under a stereomi-
croscope with continuous LED light as the distance between neighbouring 
points on the scutum (dorsal side of the thorax/mesonotum) and on the 
scutellum (dorso-apical plate of the thorax/mesonotum) on one hand, and 
the puncture diameter;
TEG	
(tegulae): colour of the scale-like structures covering the insertion point of 
the wings on the thorax/mesonotum;
ProN	
(pronotum): colour of the dorsal lobe of the first thorax/mesonotum segment;
ProLo	
(pronotal lobe): colour of the protonal lobe (also known as “humeral tu-
bercles”) located just next to the tegulae, towards the anterior site of the 
thorax/mesonotum;
TCP	
(tergite colour patches): colour, size and delineation between the orange col-
our patches on the tergites and the surrounding black cuticle;
FACE	
(face): colour of the clypeus, mandibles, lower part of paraoccular region;
LEGS	
(legs): colour of the coxae, femurs, tibiae on each pair of legs.
Photographs of the type material were taken using a Leica S8APO equipped with 
a Leica MC190 HD digital camera and a Leica LED3000 DI light dome. Series of 
shots were taken by manually adjusting the precision dial to cover the sharpness of the 
target body parts. The specialized hooked and waved hairs on the metasomal sterna

(S3-S4-S5) in males were photographed using a Canon 5DS R equipped with a Canon 
MP-E 65mm lens at 5× and (set at f/3.2 and ISO 100), mounted on a StackShot 
macro rail (distance/step = 0.01mm) and lit with two custom diffused, IR-operated 
Godox 860vii cobra flashes. All resulting photos were stacked with Helicon Focus (ver-
sion 8.2.6.) using the software’s “Depth Map mode (Method B)”. Resulting stacked 
shots were slightly edited in Adobe Lightroom and cleaned in Adobe Photoshop 2023.
Mapping of occurrence records
Shapefiles and map data derived from OpenStreetMap (copyrighted OpenStreetMap 
contributors and available from https://www.openstreetmap.org) were downloaded 
from GeoFabrik (https://download.geofabrik.de). Species distribution points were 
plotted using QGIS 3.22 -Białowieża (QGIS Development Team 2023). We have in-
cluded a series of 35 “research-grade” occurrence records of P. canariense from GBIF.
org (GBIF 2023b) and we have estimated the coordinates of another 15 conspecific 
specimens cited by Hohmann et al. (1993) based on the approximate center of the 
most specific locality given from the island of Gran Canaria. All new Pseudoanthidium 
records relevant to the islands of Lanzarote and Fuerteventura resulting from speci-
mens collected in the field or macrophotographs exhibiting enough detail to allow for 
an identification at the species level were included on the map too.
Finally, we used the elevatr package (version 0.4.2.) (Hollister 2022) to compute 
the elevation associated with each occurrence record of both Pseudoanthidium species. 
Boxplots of all records were prepared with the “ggplot2” package (Wickham 2016). All 
records, including their latitude/longitude coordinates in decimal degrees (WGS84), 
their elevation, the date of each record and their source are compiled in Suppl. mate-
rial 2. All analyses were performed with RStudio (RStudio Team 2020) for R (version 
4.2.2; R Core Team 2022).
Ecological niche characterisation
To evaluate the extent of shared environmental niche space among the two Pseudoanth-
idium species, we conducted an analysis of ecological niche characteristics. Significant 
niche differentiation is anticipated owing to the contrasting habitats between the eastern 
islands of Lanzarote and Fuerteventura and the western islands. The comparison is in-
tended to illustrate the prevailing climatic conditions for the two species. For each oc-
currence record of the two species, we extracted environmental data from a 200m buffer. 
BIOCLIM data was obtained from CHELSA (Climatologies at High resolution for the 
Earth’s Land Surface Areas) climate dataset at 30 arc seconds resolution (Karger et al. 
2017). We selected 4 bioclim variables to cover precipitation and temperature range, and 
variation (mean annual temperature/precipitation, temperature/precipitation seasonal-
ity). Elevation data was obtained from the “elevatr” package as described above. The 
background niche space was calculated based on 2,000 randomly generated points with-
in the Canary Islands. These data were then used to classify the ecological niche space 
Nicolas J. Vereecken et al.  /  Journal of Hymenoptera Research 96: 983–1015 (2023)
990
occupied by the two Pseudoanthidium species. Following Broennimann et al. (2012), we 
used a principal component analysis (PCA) that was calibrated based on the complete 
environmental space encompassing the Canary Islands, that applies smoothers to the 
species presences in environmental space for the purpose of selecting and weighting the 
environmental variables. We then computed niche overlap between the two species with 
Schoener’s D statistic (Schoener 1968; Warren et al. 2008). Finally, we tested whether 
the niche overlap of the two species is less equivalent than random by means of a niche 
equivalence test with 1,000 repetitions (Broennimann et al. 2012). These analyses were 
conducted with RStudio (RStudio Team 2020) for R (version 4.2.2; R Core Team 2022) 
using the “ecospat” package (version 3.5.1; Broennimann et al. 2023).
EOO, AOO and extinction risk assessment using IUCN criteria
We used the “red” package (version 1.5.0) (Cardoso 2017) and all occurrence re-
cords to compute the extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO) of 
P. canariense and the newly discovered Pseudoanthidium species described below. EOO 
encompasses the total geographic range of a species, while AOO focuses on the current 
occupied area of a species within its known habitat; both metrics are vital for assessing 
a species’ conservation status and can influence its IUCN Red List categorization. We 
then used the rCAT package (version 0.1.6) (Moat 2020) to calculate the IUCN rating 
of each species based on their EOO in km2.
Assessing the extinction risk of a species, including of hitherto overlooked, or new-
ly described taxa, requires using a series of criteria listed by the International Union for 
the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List (IUCN Standards and Petitions Com-
mittee 2022). These criteria are based on indicators of extinction risk and ultimately 
help assign a ranked threat category, such as critically endangered (CR), endangered 
(EN) and vulnerable (VU) (Mace et al. 2008; Nieto et al. 2014). In a nutshell, the 
five key components of an IUCN extinction risk assessment are: population reduction 
(Criterion A), restricted geographic range (Criterion B), small population size and de-
cline (Criterion C), very small or restricted population size (abundance) (Criterion D) 
and a quantitative analysis of decline (Criterion E). For each criterion, threshold values 
are defined and associated with different threat categories; we performed the assess-
ment for the new Pseudoanthidium species following practical guidelines (Rodríguez et 
al. 2015) and using as much direct (and to some extent, indirect) evidence as possible 
(Le Breton et al. 2019).
Results
Our study reveals the presence of a hitherto overlooked species within the subgenus 
Pseudoanthidium (Pseudoanthidium) in the Canary Islands. A closer examination of the 
only earlier and unpublished record of a Pseudoanthidium from Lanzarote, a female 
specimen collected by F. La Roche in Lanzarote 1997, curated in the private collection

Diagnosis. Besides differences in their distribution pattern across the Canary Is-
lands archipelago (Fig. 1), males and females of P. canariense and the newly described 
P. jacobii can be unambiguously identified based on a number of morphological criteria 
described below, including their relative size, as well as the density of the punctuation, 
the colour and the shininess of their cuticle as shown on Figs 2–4. Fig. 5 illustrates the 
structure of specialized hooked and waved hairs on the metasomal sterna (S3-S4-S5) 
in males, as well as their apicolateral combs on each lateral arm of S5.
Female. The female of P. jacobii may be distinguished from P. canariense by the fol-
lowing combination of characters: BL minimally only half size (4–7 mm in P. jacobii, 
6–9 mm in P. canariense), ITD shorter (on average: 2.13 mm in P. jacobii, 2.91 mm in 
P. canariense), OOD shorter (~ 1 ocellar diameter in P. jacobii, ~ 1.5–2 ocellar diam-
eters in P. canariense), TPD lower (spaces between points at least ~ 1–1.5 diameter of a 
single point in P. jacobii, < 0.5 diameter of a single point in P. canariense), SSPD slight-
ly higher (~ 0.5 diameter of a single point in P. jacobii, < 0.5 diameter of a single 
point in P. canariense), TEG brighter (orange-yellow in P. jacobii, black in P. canar-
iense), ProN brighter (orange-yellow in P. jacobii, black in P. canariense), ProLo mostly 
brighter (orange-yellow like the tegulae in P. jacobii, black in P. canariense, but more 
specimens of each species should be examined), TCP wider, brighter (wide and or-
ange-yellow in P. jacobii, narrower and dark orange in P. canariense), and with a better 
defined maculation margin (gradual infiltration of the black colour into the orange yel-
low maculations of the integument in P. jacobii, well-defined colour boundary/contrast 
between darker orange maculations and black cuticule in P. canariense), FACE brighter 
(orange-yellow clypeus, mandibles, lower part of paraoccular region in P. jacobii, all 
black in P. canariense) and wider (face broader than long in P. jacobii, face longer than 
broad in P. canariense), LEGS brighter (all legs black only from the coxa to the very 
base of the femur black, the rest of the femur and other leg segments are orangish yel-
low in P. jacobii, all coxae, femurs but only posterior tibiae black in P. canariense).

Male. The male of P. jacobii may be distinguished from P. canariense by the fol-
lowing combination of characters: BL minimally only half size (4–6 mm in P. jacobii, 
6–8 mm in P. canariense), ITD shorter (on average: 2.22 mm in P. jacobii, 2.95 mm 
in P. canariense), OOD shorter (~ 1 ocellar diameter in P. jacobii, ~ 1.5–2 ocellar 
diameters in P. canariense), TPD lower (spaces between points at least ~ 1–1.5 diam-
eter of a single point in P. jacobii, < 0.5 diameter of a single point in P. canariense), 
SSPD slightly higher (~ 0.5 diameter of a single point in P. jacobii, < 0.5 diameter 
of a single point in P. canariense), TEG brighter (orange-yellow in P. jacobii, black in 
P. canariense), ProN brighter (orange-yellow in P. jacobii, black in P. canariense), ProLo 
mostly brighter (orange-yellow like the tegulae in P. jacobii, black in P. canariense, 
but more specimens of each species should be examined), TCP wider, brighter (wide 
and orange-yellow in P. jacobii, narrower and dark orange in P. canariense), and with

Etymology. Pseudoanthidium (Pseudoanthidium) jacobii is dedicated to Mr. Bern-
hard Jacobi (Oberhausen, Germany), naturalist extraordinaire and talented macro-
photographer who has a genuine and boundless passion for wild bees, particularly 
for species found in Europe and Australia. Bernhard’s interest for the Canary Islands 
has grown steadily and uninterrupted ever since the publication of Hohmann et al.’s 
(1993) landmark volume on the bees, wasps and ants of the archipelago. He has since 
then investigated the entomofauna of all of the Canary Islands in situ, reporting and 
illustrating the occurrence and distribution of the European Beewolf, Philanthus trian-
gulum (Fabricius, 1775) on the archipelago (Jacobi et al. 2013), as well as new records 
on the distribution and phenology of Colletes perezi Morice, 1904 on Fuerteventu-
ra (Jacobi and Suárez 2018) and the first record of the American species Megachile 
(Chelostomoides) otomita Cresson, 1878 established on Tenerife (Strudwick and Jacobi 
2018). Bernhard and his wife have been regular visitors to Lanzarote for over three 
decades, particularly during the winter months, and he was the third person (after 
authors NJV on 18.iv.2021 and MPG 12.ii.2023) to photograph a live specimen of 
P. jacobii in Lanzarote on 12.iii.2023 (Fig. 1D). Bernhard has also recently contributed 
new occurrence records of the widespread small carder bee P. nanum near his home in 
the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia (Jacobi et al. 2021).
Genetic differentiation between P. jacobii and other Pseudoanthidium species
The results of CO1 analyses demonstrate that P. jacobii is strongly supported as the 
sister species to P. canariense (ML bootstrap value = 96%) (Fig. 6). The two species 
are separated by a K2P-corrected genetic distance of 2.7%. Furthermore, P. jacobii 
exhibits an average K2P-corrected genetic distance of 5.9% from the clade consisting 
of P. nanum - P. scapulare - P. palestinicum; of 5.1% from P. stigmaticorne; and of 5.3% 
from the clade consisting of P. tenellum - P. cribratum.
Ecology, distribution and ecological niche differentiation
Habitat and host plant associations
In Lanzarote, the vegetation at the localities of Haría and Bco. de Elvira Sánchez 
where males and females of P. jacobii were recorded was composed of a chamaephytic 
substitutional flowering plant community established on old agricultural land with 
deep soils, generally on eroded slopes and on stony slopes, ravines, ledges physiog-
nomically characterised by the presence of Asteriscus intermedius (DC.) Pit. & Proust 
(Asteraceae) and Lavandula pinnata L. (Lamiaceae) among others (see also Rámon 
Arévalo et al. 2016). By contrast, the localities of Teguise and Macher are peri-urban

or rural anthropic areas with sparse natural vegetation, and the locality of Valle del 
Palomo is composed of xeric shrubland with a physiognomy of dendroid spurge 
shrubland, dominated by Euphorbia regis-jubae J. Gay (Euphorbiaceae). This is sec-
ondary vegetation typically found on abandoned arable or pastureland, roadsides 
and watercourse-beds (Reyes-Betancourt et al. 2001). In Fuerteventura, the local-
ity of Betancuria where a female of P. jacobii was photographed is characterised by 
a flowering plant community consisting of dwarf chamaephytes exposed to strong 
winds and heavily grazed, where Helianthemum canariense (Jacq.) Pers. (Asterace-
ae) and Spergularia fimbriata Boiss. & Reut. (Caryophyllaceae) are dominant (del 
Arco Aguilar et al. 2018). Females of P. (P.) jacobii were observed collecting pollen 
on A. intermedius (DC.) Pit. & Proust (endemic to Fuerteventura and Lanzarote) 
(Fig. 1), Pulicaria canariensis subsp. lanata (Font Quer & Svent.) Bramwell & G. 
Kunkel (endemic to Lanzarote), and Glebionis coronaria (L.) Cass. ex Spach (syn. 
Chrysanthemum coronarium L., native and of Mediterranean origin) (Asteraceae). 
Males were also observed nectaring and patrolling for females on and around the 
same flowering plant species.
Nesting behaviour
A single observation by co-author BJ in Lanzarote on 16.iii.2023 of a female nesting 
in a pre-existing cavity formed in a lava rock (Fig. 1D). All Pseudoanthidium species are 
reported to nest in pre-existing cavities or in pithy plant stems (see Litman et al. 2021 
and references therein; Bogusch et al. 2022).
Ecological niche differentiation
The environmental niche space occupied by P. canariense encompasses a large part of 
the total environmental niche space available in the Canary Islands, covering wide 
elevation (from 70 m to 2,046 m with a mean of 952 m), mean annual temperature 
(8.3 °C to 20.9°C, µ=15.2 °C), and mean annual rainfall (135 kg m-2 to 534 kg m-2, 
µ=354.7 mm) gradients with greater temperature (1.9 °C to 2.2 °C, µ=2.1 °C) and 
lower precipitation seasonality (73 kg m-2, 90 kg m-2, µ=81.2 kg m-2) gradients and 
occupying a variety of land cover types (Fig. 7). The environmental niche space of PB 
is almost entirely separate from the niche space occupied by P. canariense and is driven 
by low elevation (204 m to 460 m, µ=268 m) (Fig. 7), warmer (17.6 °C to 19.5 °C, 
µ=18.7 °C), and drier (101 kg m-2 to 170 kg m-2, µ=138.9 kg m-2) areas with less 
variation in temperature (1.9 °C to 2.0°C, µ=2.0 °C) and more varied rainfall (92 kg 
m-2, 100 kg m-2, µ=96.9 kg m-2) (Fig. 7). This comparison, as hypothesised, strongly 
represents the climatic and elevational differences between the islands where the spe-
cies occur. The overlap between the two species represents the limits of the niche for 
P. canariense. As shown on Fig. 8, overall niche overlap between the two species is 
less than 1% and we can accept the alternative hypothesis that the two niches are less 
equivalent than random (p=<0.001).

Distribution and threats
Due to a lack of historical baseline data, we could not evaluate P. jacobii using IUCN 
Criterion A (population reduction). However, with an EOO of 326 km2 and an AOO 
of 28 km2, P. jacobii fulfils both Criteria B1 and B2 (restricted geographic range; EOO 
< 5,000 km2 and AOO < 500 km2, respectively) (IUCN 2023).
Our current knowledge suggests that P. jacobii is known only from Mediterranean 
type shrubland vegetation localities on the islands of Lanzarote and Fuerteventura 
(Fig. 1). The key host plants exclusively visited by P. jacobii females for the collection of 
pollen include the herbaceous single-island endemic Pulicaria canariensis subsp. lanata 
(Font Quer & Svent.) Bramwell & G. Kunkel (endemic to Lanzarote), the archipel-
ago endemic Asteriscus intermedius (DC.) Pit. & Proust (endemic to Fuerteventura 
and Lanzarote) and the native non-endemic Glebionis coronaria (L.) Cass. ex Spach, 
all belonging to the family Asteraceae. According to a recent study by Hanz et al. 
(2023), climate change will severely restrict the climatically suitable area of Canarian 
herbaceous plant species, particularly archipelago endemics and single-island endemic 
species, and particularly on the islands of Lanzarote and Fuerteventura, which are ex-
pected to experience less annual precipitation in the future. This phenomenon along 
with the negative impacts of invasive flowering plant species in the archipelago (del 
Arco Aguilar et al. 2018; but see Fernandez-Palacios et al. 2022), is very likely going 
to affect the availability of floral resources used by P. jacobii females, with cascading 
impacts on their population size and distribution.

According to the IUCN, populations are considered “severely fragmented” if most 
individuals are found in small and relatively isolated subpopulations, where the prob-
ability of recolonization is reduced, should these subpopulations go extinct (IUCN 
2023). Under this strict definition, populations of P. jacobii, restricted to extremely 
isolated pockets on Lanzarote and Fuerteventura, may be considered severely frag-
mented, thus fulfilling both criteria B1a and B2a. Furthermore, the continuous devel-
opment of touristic infrastructures on both islands, the increase of pollution brought 
about by new roads facilitating transport and tourism across the islands (Martín-Cejas 
and Ramírez Sánchez 2010), the increase in car ownership and usage (Martín-Cejas 
2015), and other pervasive forms of anthropogenic disturbance such as irresponsible 
off-roading practices (with associated pollution, damages on plant and animal life, and 
increased soil erosion rates), sand extraction, wind farms, and increased goat grazing 
(Nogales et al. 2006; Banos-González et al. 2016; Cubas et al. 2019) are all likely to 
have a severely negative impact on the extent and/or the quality of Mediterranean-type

shrubland vegetation favoured by P. jacobii and its key host plants. This, in turn, might 
lead to a continuous reduction of EOO, AOO, the number of subpopulations and the 
number of mature individuals stemming from a reduction in foraging resources. Fol-
lowing this scenario, P. jacobii also fulfils criteria B1ab(i,ii,iii,iv,v) and B2ab(i,ii,iii,iv,v).
Our field experience further suggests that P. jacobii is characterised by very small 
population sizes: this can be argued based on the fact (i) that we failed to collect more 
than two specimens at each sampled locality when the number of specimens should 
have been at its peak, (ii) that P. jacobii has been completely overlooked up to the pre-
sent day, and (iii) that females and males are relatively conspicuous in colour, sharing 
their pollen host plant species with other Canarian bee species active at the same time 
of the year, namely in early Spring. Hence, P. jacobii also fulfils Criterion C2a(i) based 
on a conservative estimation of the total number of mature individuals < 2,500 across 
its distribution, as well as an estimated, projected, or inferred decline for reasons de-
tailed above and < 250 mature specimens per subpopulation (IUCN 2023).
Because of a lack of population size estimation or comprehensive evaluation of the 
number of extant populations and their trends, we were unable to classify P. jacobii 
under Criteria D and E (IUCN 2023).
Last, we obtained convergent results through the parallel calculation of the IUCN 
rating based on EOO Area (in km2) with the “EOORating” function in the rCAT 
package, which suggests that P. jacobii should be classified as “EN” (endangered).
Given the above results, P. jacobii thus qualifies for “EN” (endangered) conser-
vation status under IUCN Criteria B1ab(i,ii,iii,iv,v), B2ab(i,ii,iii,iv,v) and Criterion 
C2a(i); this status is also supported by the results of the “EOORating” analysis men-
tioned above. We thus propose an IUCN conservation status of “EN” (endangered) 
for this species.
Discussion
A new species of Pseudoanthidium from the Canary Islands
Twenty-two years after the last description of two new Megachilidae bee species in 
the CI archipelago, Osmia palmae Tkalçů (Tkalçů 2001a) and the cuckoo Dioxys lan-
zarotensis Tkalçů (Tkalçů 2001b), we provide evidence for the presence of a hitherto 
overlooked species of Pseudoanthidium on the islands of Fuerteventura and Lanzarote, 
the archipelago’s “Eastern Islands”. We describe this new species as Pseudoanthidium 
(Pseudoanthidium) jacobii Vereecken & Litman spec. nov., and we illustrate its close 
evolutionary relatedness to the Canarian endemic P. canariense. We have highlighted 
key diagnostic morphological traits to discriminate between the two Canarian Pseu-
doanthidium for each sex (Figs 1–5) and a degree of genetic divergence of 2.7%, lower 
than, yet still in keeping with, the genetic distances observed between other major clad-
es in the P. scapulare complex (Litman et al. 2021). Last, our results illustrate that these 
two small carder bee species are allopatric in their contemporary distribution (Fig. 1), 
Nicolas J. Vereecken et al.  /  Journal of Hymenoptera Research 96: 983–1015 (2023)
1004
they exhibit a significant differentiation in elevation range (Fig. 6), as well as a very low 
overlap (1%) in their respective ecological niches (Figs 7, 8), due in large part to the 
different climate of the islands on which they occur. Collectively, and in light of the 
criteria generally used to delineate species in this genus (Litman et al. 2021; Niu et al. 
2021), our observations therefore suggest that P. jacobii deserves its own species status.
Most females in the subgenus Pseudoanthidium (Pseudoanthidium), and particularly 
in the P. scapulare species complex, appear to have a strong preference for host plants in 
the family Asteraceae (Litman et al. 2021; Niu et al. 2021; Kasparek and Ebmer 2023). 
A strong preference of P. jacobii for host plants in the family Asteraceae might therefore 
reflect a phylogenetic conservatism of pollen diet, a phenomenon already described in 
several other groups of wild bees in Europe (Müller and Kuhlmann 2008; Sedivy et al. 
2008; Dötterl and Vereecken 2010; Wood et al. 2021; Dorchin et al. 2022).
Canarian Pseudoanthidium species and other members of the P. scapulare 
complex
The Pseudoanthidium scapulare complex of species is distributed throughout the 
Palaearctic region. Certain members of the complex represent closely related species 
pairs that are sympatric throughout a part of their distributions, including P. nanum 
- P. scapulare and P. tenellum - P. cribratum. Both of these pairs are morphologically 
distinct but exhibit relatively low levels of genetic differentiation in analyses of CO1 
(0.35% and 0.59%, respectively) (Litman et al. 2021). In recent analyses, however, 
neither P. nanum - P. scapulare nor P. tenellum - P. cribratum showed evidence of 
barcode-sharing and in both cases, historical mitochondrial introgression was deemed 
the most likely explanation for the low levels of genetic differentiation observed in these 
species pairs (Litman et al. 2021). This argument was further supported by a UCE 
analysis of P. nanum and P. scapulare that provided strong evidence of two genetically 
distinct lineages (Litman et al. 2021). In comparison, P. canariense and P. jacobii show 
consistent morphological differences but a K2P-corrected genetic distance of 2.7% at 
the CO1 locus, somewhat higher than the distances separating P. nanum - P. scapulare 
and P. tenellum - P. cribratum. Pseudoanthidium canariense and P. jacobii may thus 
represent species whose genetic divergence was facilitated by the reproductive barrier 
imposed by their distributions on different islands. Further analyses of genomic-level 
data are needed to better understand the evolutionary history of these taxa.
Our morphological analysis and that of Litman et al. (2021) illustrate that both 
P. canariense and P. jacobii have gonostyli that are approximately parallel-sided and 
exhibit a rounded (i.e., unnotched) apex. This is in marked contrast to other species in 
the P. scapulare complex (except P. tropicum (Warncke, 1982) known only from Iran 
so far, see Litman et al. (2021)), which have an obvious U-shaped notch at the apex 
of their gonostyli). Interestingly, the absence of a notch is also a feature shared with 
non-scapulare complex Pseudoanthidium species (see Niu et al. 2021; Kasparek and Eb-
mer 2023), which calls into question the ancestral or derived nature of the gonostylus 
notch in small carder bees.

Given the lack of resolution in our analyses of CO1, namely regarding the phylo-
genetic relationships among different clades within the complex, we can only propose 
hypotheses to explain the presence of a rounded gonostylus in P. jacobii and P. canariense. 
If the clade represented by these two species is the sister group to all other members of 
the P. scapulare complex, then one possible explanation is that the common ancestor of 
P. jacobii and P. canariense colonised the Canary Islands prior to the origin of other mem-
bers of the P. scapulare complex (Litman et al. 2021), i.e., the presence of the rounded 
gonostylus may represent the plesiomorphic state for the complex. If this clade, how-
ever, turns out to be nested within the complex, another possible explanation is that the 
gonostylus in the common ancestor of P. jacobii and P. canariense may have undergone a 
reversion to an ancestral state. If speciation may be driven, at least partially, by morpho-
logical barriers to reproduction (Oneal and Knowles 2013; Huang et al. 2020), perhaps 
the marked differences in the shape of the gonostylus in other, closely related members of 
the P. scapulare complex (i.e., P. nanum and P. scapulare) may have been significant driv-
ers of speciation, especially in sympatric populations. On the Canary Islands, where the 
diversity of closely related species is considerably lower than on the mainland, selective 
pressure on the shape of the gonostylus may be less intense, thus facilitating a reversion 
to an ancestral state. A future phylogenomic approach to an analysis of this genus using 
more samples of each species from across their distribution should shed light on the evo-
lution of this and other traits in the genus Pseudoanthidium and contribute to improving 
our knowledge on the diversification and historical biogeography of small carder bees.
Diversity and endemism in Lanzarote and Fuerteventura
Ever since Antiquity, historians, traders and (bio)geographers have acknowledged the 
peculiar nature of Lanzarote and Fuerteventura, these “Eastern Islands” of the Canary 
archipelago. Although they form two islands today, they are, geologically speaking, the 
oldest emerging part of the archipelago that used to be merged during the Pleistocene 
glacial cycles, forming the paleo-island of Mahan (Rijsdijk et al. 2014). These two is-
lands were also historically referred to as the “Islas Purpurarias” (Garcia-Talavera 2016). 
The origin of this name supposedly traces back to the peak trade period of Roccella 
canariensis Darb. (Roccellaceae), a lichen species endemic to the Canary Islands and 
locally known as orchilla. This lichen grew on the cliffs of Lanzarote and Fuerteventura 
at the seashore and was unique as a natural source of the red-purple pigment orcein, a 
highly sought-after resource in the textile industry up until the end of the 19th century.
By describing P. jacobii as an endemic species from the Purpurarias, we provide further 
evidence for the peculiar environmental conditions met on the islands of Lanzarote and 
Fuerteventura within the Canary Islands archipelago, and how original life forms have 
evolved solely on these two islands. Single-island endemics are reported in the eastern CI, 
such as Tetralonia lanzarotensis Tkalçů, 1993 (Apidae) and Dioxys (Dioxys) lanzaroten-
sis Tkalçů, 2001 (Megachilidae) from Lanzarote, or Megachile (Eutricharaea) hohmanni 
Tkalçů, 1993 (Megachilidae) and Dufourea fortunata Ebmer, 1993 (Halictidae), both re-
corded exclusively from Fuerteventura within the CI archipelago (Hohmann et al. 1993).

1006
Examples of other wild bee species sharing a distribution restricted to these two 
islands include Anthophora purpuraria Westrich, 1993 (Apidae) (whose specific epi-
thet derives directly from the “Purpurarias”), as well as other Anthophorini species 
like A. (Heliophila) lanzarotensis (Tkalçů, 1993), A. (Heliophila) lieftincki (Tkalçů, 
1993), A. (Pyganthophora) porphyrea Westrich, 1993 (all endemic to Lanzarote and 
Fuerteventura) and some of their associated cuckoos such as Melecta (Melecta) caro-
li Lieftinck, 1958, and M. (Melecta) prophanta Lieftinck, 1980 (on Lanzarote only) 
(Hohmann et al. 1993). Other cuckoos of these narrow endemic and other more 
ubiquitous Anthophorini species might include Thyreus histrionicus (Illiger, 1806) and 
T. ramosus (Lepeletier, 1841) that have a Circum-Mediterranean distribution (Michez 
et al. 2019; Leclercq et al. 2022). Likewise, the family Megachilidae has a few endem-
ic representatives, such as Hoplitis (Tkalcua) zandeni (Teunissen & van Achterberg, 
1992) that nests in empty snail shells (Müller and Mauss 2016), Megachile (Chalico-
doma) fuerteventurae (Tkalçů, 1993) and M. (Eutricharaea) binominata Smith, 1853 
(Hohmann et al. 1993). The Andrenidae fauna of the Canary Islands also includes nar-
row endemics to Lanzarote and Fuerteventura, such as Andrena (Chlorandrena) damara 
Warncke, 1968 or A. (Aciandrena) hillana Warncke, 1968 (Hohmann et al. 1993).
It is important to note that some species originally described from a single island 
(such as A. (H.) lanzarotensis or M. (C.) fuerteventurae, as their specific epithet sug-
gests) turned out to be discovered on both islands after a few decades of field sur-
veys. These recent records contribute to the emergence of distribution patterns among 
closely related, endemic species in different groups of wild bees, with some restricted 
to the eastern islands and others present only in the central (and western) islands. For 
example, the three Megachile (Chalicodoma) species recorded in the archipelago exhibit 
such a distribution pattern similar to the Pseudoanthidium species discussed here, with 
M. (C.) canescens (Brullé, 1840) restricted to the central and western islands, whereas 
M. (C.) sicula (Rossi, 1794) and M. (C.) fuerteventurae are found only on the eastern 
islands (Lanzarote and Fuerteventura) (Hohmann et al. 1993). Likewise, Megachile 
(Eutricharaea) canariensis Pérez, 1902 is restricted to the central and western islands, 
whereas M. (E.) binominata is endemic to Lanzarote and Fuerteventura.
Interestingly, no species in the families Colletidae or Melittidae is endemic to Lan-
zarote and Fuerteventura: these families encompass CI endemic species distributed 
across the eastern, central and western islands, but none are restricted to eastern islands. 
Those that are found on these islands have a much wider distribution encompassing 
Morocco and sometimes extending to the Levant and even the Arabian Peninsula (e.g., 
for Melitta schmiedeknechti Friese, 1898 (Melittidae); see Shebl et al. (2016)).
At their nearest point, Lanzarote and Fuerteventura are located just under 100 km 
(60 miles) off the coasts of Morocco (García Talavera 1999; Florencio et al. 2021). This 
relative proximity is therefore likely to have favoured faunal exchanges across families 
of bees between the Canary Islands archipelago and the African continent. For exam-
ple, Andrena (Distandrena) mariana s.str. Warncke, 1968 (Andrenidae) was described 
from the island of Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands, and its description was as-
sociated with a remark that the species could potentially be found in Morocco as well 
(Warncke 1968). A similar distribution bridging the Canary Islands archipelago and

the south-western coasts of Morocco has already been found in Lasioglossum (Evylaeus) 
phoenicurum (Warncke, 1975) (Pauly 2016), in Nomioides (Nomioides) fortunatus 
Blüthgen, 1937 (Pauly 2017) (both Halictidae), as well as in Haetosmia circumventa 
(Peters, 1974) (Müller 2022), and these findings could probably be echoed in different 
genera of the diverse family Apidae among others (A. Dorchin, pers. comm. July 2023; 
P. Rasmont, pers. comm. July 2023). More surveys along the coasts of south-western 
Morocco are needed to determine if other species considered as endemic to the Canary 
Islands, including P. jacobii, show similar patterns “bridging” the distribution gap with 
the African continent.
Threats to a new bee species and the Canary Islands bee fauna
Are newly discovered species at a higher risk of extinction than those first described 
long ago? According to Liu et al. (2022), the trend is positive and significant across 
major vertebrate groups (amphibians, birds, fish, mammals, and reptiles), and it is 
driven by several factors, including their often-smaller population numbers and re-
stricted distribution range making them vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation. 
Whether this applies to less intensively investigated groups of organisms like insects, 
and wild bees in particular, has not been adequately tested so far. Yet, these results sug-
gest that extinction risk assessments that are based on overall threat status of all species 
combined may seriously underestimate the true number of species threatened with 
extinction (McKinney 1999).
Here, we classified the new species P. jacobii as Endangered (EN) according to 
IUCN Criteria B1ab(i,ii,iii,iv,v), B2ab(i,ii,iii,iv,v) and Criterion C2a(i), as well as 
based on the parallel calculation of the IUCN rating based on EOO Area (in km2). 
In other words, and practically speaking, this means that P. jacobii is threatened with 
extinction and might experience continuous decline unless conservation efforts are 
made. The results of our extinction risk assessment are also motivated by the fact that 
P. jacobii, similarly to other threatened wild bee species, typically occurs within a few 
small patches rather than a spatially continuous area of uniform presence. This patchy 
distribution implies that P. jacobii is exposed to comparatively higher extinction risks, 
because there is a greater chance that one or several of the identified threats will act 
in concert and will affect all or most of the distribution within a certain time frame. 
How imminent the identified risks are has remained elusive for a long time, but in 
recent years the Canary Islands and the “Purpurarias” in particular have seen droughts 
and heatwaves, just like large parts of the drought-stricken mainland. These changing 
weather patterns are the direct outcome of climate change operating in real time, and 
in the worst-case scenario they have even combined with environmental hazards like 
the 2021 Cumbre Vieja volcano eruption on the island of La Palma, followed in 2023 
by massive wildfires breaking out and threatening all terrestrial forms of life on several 
of the Western Canary Islands. Such wildfires are less likely on Fuerteventura and 
Lanzarote due to their scarce vegetation and lack of forested areas (Carillo et al. 2022).
The Canary Islands archipelago, like many other insular ecosystems renowned 
for their breath-taking natural beauty, faces major challenges in achieving a delicate 
Nicolas J. Vereecken et al.  /  Journal of Hymenoptera Research 96: 983–1015 (2023)
1008
balance between promoting recreational activities and preserving its fragile biodiversity 
as the effects of climate change become increasingly pronounced. Our study illustrates 
that our understanding of biodiversity in the archipelago is far from complete, and that 
international scientific collaborations with local experts and citizen science projects 
can help gain significant insights into species distribution and ecological interactions. 
This paper also confirms the vivid interest of the international scientific community 
towards the Canary Islands bee fauna and its conservation (see also Monasterio León 
et al. 2023), and highlights that more targeted field surveys and increased sampling 
efforts, primarily in the eastern and less sampled western islands, but also slightly be-
fore or after the typical “bee season” of January-April, and in high altitude ecosystems 
found on Gran Canaria and Tenerife still have the potential to reveal other unique taxa 
and contribute to refine our understanding of the spatial taxonomic, functional and 
phylogenetic patterns of diversity and endemism of the CI wild bees.
