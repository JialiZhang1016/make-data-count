Characterization, and Application
Ann Christin Reiersølmoen[a] and Anne Fiksdahl*[a]
Abstract: Studies on gold(III) coordination of a series of pre-
pared polydentate pyridine and quinoline based ligands are re-
ported. Characterization (1H, 13C, 15N NMR, and XRD) of the
novel gold(III) complexes, prepared in 31–98 % yield, revealed
different coordination ability of the pyridine and quinoline
nitrogen atoms. Testing of catalytic activity in cyclopropanation
Introduction
Homogeneous gold catalysis in organic synthesis has become
a rapidly growing field within the last decades.[1] However, gold
catalysis is still described as a new and young area compared
to the chemistry of the more utilized and developed neighbors
in the periodic table e.g. Pt, Pd, Hg, Rh, Ru and Ir.[2] This is
often evidenced by the mechanism for gold catalysis being less
understood and explored compared to the other transition
metals.[3] The development of gold catalysis has mainly focused
on gold(I) species, as shown by a large number of reported
ligated gold(I) complexes utilized in various catalytic transfor-
mations.[4] Also reaction mechanisms have been studied by
characterization of reactive intermediates and by corroboration
of the experimental data with computational studies.[4b,4c,5] Ca-
talysis by gold(III) has, on the other hand, been less developed
and is still mainly dominated by the inorganic gold(III) salts,
such as AuCl3 and KAuCl4.[6] However, compared to the linear
gold(I) complexes, the square-planar coordination mode of
gold(III) species may provide advantages in order to obtain im-
proved control around the reaction center and, hence, influence
the selectivity of the catalytic reaction. A great variety of strate-
gies for design of mono- and polydentate ligands and their
Au(III) complexes is conceivable. It is also shown that the oxid-
ation state of gold can affect the reactivity and outcome for
some organic transformation.[4a]
However, in recent years, interesting ligated gold(III) com-
plexes are reported. Although some of the compounds are

of propargyl ester and styrene demonstrated that all the new
ligated gold(III) complexes were catalytically active and outper-
formed KAuCl4. The superior activity of the particular Au(III)-
pyridine-oxazole complexes may indicate de-coordination of
the pyridine-N ligand as a crucial step for efficient generation
of catalytic activity.
studied as catalysts in organic transformations,[7] the Au(III)-li-
gand concept was initially mainly developed for bioactive stud-
ies. A number of stable Au(III)-ligand complexes were designed
as promising candidates for biological testing, such as anti-
tumor agents,[8] anticancer,[9] Anti-parasitic agents,[10] antifun-
gal,[11] inhibition of DNA/RNA synthesis,[12] and aquaporin inhi-
bition.[13] The reported gold(III) complexes are often based on
nitrogen containing ligands, such as diamine, polyamine, cyc-
lam, bipyridyl, porphyrin, phenanthroline and terpyridine.
The limited experience and understanding of the chemistry
of gold(III)-ligand species, indicates that more knowledge is
needed for development of stable Au(III) complexes and for
studies of their catalytic activity.
We have previously prepared gold(III) complexes based on
bisoxazoline and 2-pyridylmenthol ligands, and studied their
catalytic properties in cyclopropanation reactions.[14] We hereby
present further studies on the synthesis of a series of new pyr-
idyl and quinolinyl based polydentate ligands, along with
gold(III) coordination studies. The catalytic ability of the new
gold(III) complexes in cyclopropanation reaction is studied, as
well.
Results and Discussion
Preparation of 2-(Quinolin-2-yl)- and 2-(Pyridin-2-yl)-4,5-
dihydrooxazole Gold(III) Complexes, 1-Au(III) and 2-Au(III)
Ligated gold(III) complexes based on bisoxazoline,[14,15] pyridi-
nyl-oxazolines[16] and 2,6-bisoxazoline-pyridine[17] have previ-
ously been prepared with different counterions. Given the affin-
ity of gold(III) to coordinate to such heterocyclic ligands, we
initially studied the coordination ability of gold(III) to (S)-4-iso-
propyl-2-(quinolin-2-yl)-4,5-dihydrooxazole,
1a,
and
(S)-4-
phenyl-2-(quinolin-2-yl)-4,5-dihydrooxazole, 1b, (Scheme 1a).
The coordination of the alkyl-substituted ligand (R = iPr) to
AuCl3 seemed to give a mixture of two complexes (1H NMR).

for coordination. This method allowed successful formation of
the oxazole mono-coordinated crystalline 1a-Au(III) complex as
the only product (74 % yield, Scheme 1a). Addition of NH4PF6
was not required to efficiently obtain the corresponding 1b-
Au(III) complex (98 %) with the phenyl-substituted ligand (R =
Ph).

The crystal structure (XRD) of the 1a-Au(III) complex con-
firmed the formation of a mono-coordinated Au(III) complex
through the oxazole-nitrogen, while no coordination of the

It is expected that the 1-Au(III) complexes would be more

gands were coordinated to gold(III). Different conditions were
tested in order to facilitate exchange of the second strongly

coordinated chlorine with the quinoline nitrogen (Table 1).
However, none of the experiments, including varied tempera-
ture, microwave heating or addition of weakly coordinating an-
ions, resulted in coordination of the second nitrogen to gold(III).
However, an interesting difference between the quinoline li-
gands was identified, as the iPr-substituted ligand, 1a, had
higher stability than the phenyl analogue 1b. By heating (60 °C)
the coordination solution of AuCl3 and the ligand 1b, a ring
opened and gold(III) reduction minor product, the [(2-ammoni-
umquinoline carboxylate){Au(I)Cl2}] complex, was identified
(XRD, Figure 1c, Scheme 1c, Table 1, entry 6). The possible nu-
cleophilic attack of water on the oxazoline ring to afford ring
opening, was however, not observed for the more stable ligand
1a at the same conditions (Table 1, entry 1). The ring opening
reaction was also observed by storage of the coordination solu-
tion of AuCl3 and the 1b ligand in dichloromethane for 2–3
days. Corresponding ring opening of the oxazoline ring in the
presence of water under weak basic conditions[16] or during
gold(III) coordination in aqueous media[17] has been reported.
In contrast to the presently observed aminocarboxylate com-
plex formed by cleavage of C=N bond by water, we recently
observed that oxazole ring opening by nucleophilic attack of
strongly coordinating anions on 2-Au(III) complexes gave a dif-
ferent outcome, as the nucleophilic CF3CO2– or NO3– anions
attack the oxazoline-CH2, to give cleavage of the oxazoline CH2-
O bond.[19]

As the unsuccessful coordination of the quinoline nitrogen
could be explained by insufficient electron density caused by
electron delocalization in the benzo-fused aromatic system, the
analogues pyridine ligand would be more promising for bident-
ate coordination. In fact, initial treatment of the pyridine-ox-
azoline ligand 2 (Scheme 1b) with gold(III) (1 equiv. AuCl3) gave
50 % conversion of the ligand into a new product, which was
initially believed to be a Au(III) complex with AuCl4– as counter-
ion, as reported for similar ligands.[16] However, a new minor
product was also selectively formed by reflux of ligand 2 and
AuCl3 in acetonitrile and was identified (XRD, Figure 1d) as the
ammonium-picolinate Au(I)Cl2 complex, which is the similar
ring opened product as described above (Figure 1c).
It is previously reported that ligand coordination in the pres-
ence of a silver salt of a weakly coordinating ion may give more
selective coordination to gold(III) and also prevent formation of
AuCl4– complexes.[14,16] This method successfully gave crystal-
line 2-Au(III) complexes with the different counterions SbF6–,
BF4– and Tf2N– (61–82 %, Scheme 1b) by addition of the appro-

priate silver salts.[19] Preparation of a 2-Au(III) complex by BArF
counterion exchange with the NaBArF salt failed, possibly due
to the lack of driving force gained by the precipitation of AgCl,
using the silver salt of the counterion.
The crystal structures of 2-Au(III) with SbF6 as the counter-
ions were determined (XRD, Figure 1b). In contrast to the quin-
oline ligands, the pyridine analogues coordinated efficiently
with both heterocyclic nitrogen atoms in a bidentate Au(III) co-
ordination mode. Only the main structure with SbF6 as counter-
ion is shown. However, X-ray analysis showed that the corre-
sponding complex with AuCl4 counterion also was formed.
However, selective preparation of the 2-Au(III)-SbF6 complex
was readily obtained by increasing the amount of AgSbF6 from
1.2 to 2 equivalents in order to suppress the formation of the
unwanted AuCl4 counterion.
The different coordination abilities of pyridine and quinoline
nitrogen atoms to the gold(III), shown by XRD (Figure 1a, b),
were also clearly recognized by 1H NMR. Monitoring of the gold
coordination experiments of quinoline and pyridine based li-
gands, afforded a convenient method for identifying selective
mono- or bidentate Au(III) coordination modes (Figure 2). Coor-
dination of pyridine-oxazoline ligand 2 to Au(III) and formation
of the 2-Au(III) complexes gave strong and significant deshield-
ing effects and large peak shifts (Δδ1Hcoord = δ1Hcomplex –
δ1Hligand) of most pyridine protons (Δδ1Hcoord up to 0.8 ppm,
Figure 2a). Whereas pyridine coordinates through its nitrogen,
the delocalized aromatic electron structure of the benzo-fused
quinoline analogue prohibits N-coordination to gold(III), as
shown by the moderate deshielding effect and peak shifts of
the quinoline protons H3 and H4 (Δδ1Hcoord 0.2–0.6 ppm, Fig-
ure 2b). In particular, protons H5–8 in the benzo-fused quinol-
ine part were weakly affected by coordination and experience
minor deshielding (Δδ1Hcoord < 0.2 ppm). The selective coordi-
nation effect was seen by 1H NMR for both the complexes 1a-
Au(III) and 1b-Au(III) and demonstrates that no nitrogen-
gold(III) coordination of quinoline takes place.

atoms in the 2-Au(III) complexes were clearly affected by coor-
dination, as shown by large differences of both the pyridine
nitrogen (Δδ15Ncoord –87.5 ppm) and the oxazoline nitrogen
(Δδ15Ncoord –41.1ppm) by 1H,15N HMBC in CD3CN, indicating
bidentate Au(III) coordination of the pyridine-oxazoline ligand
2. In contrast, similar studies of the 1a-Au(III) complex, indicated
that the quinoline nitrogen was hardly affected by coordination,
as shown by a minor NMR peak change (Δδ15Ncoord 2.2 ppm).
Mono-coordination of the oxazoline nitrogen was demon-
strated by the large difference of the oxazoline nitrogen signal
upon coordination (Δδ15Ncoord –76.2 ppm).
Different impact on the oxazoline nitrogen atoms by coordi-
nation of the pyridine and the quinoline complexes was seen.
Larger Δδ15Ncoord and stronger coordination of Au(III) to the
oxazoline nitrogen was observed for the mono-dentate quinol-
ine based complex (Δδ15Ncoord –76.2 ppm) than the di-coordi-
nated pyridine complex (Δδ15Ncoord –41.1 ppm). Additionally,
13C NMR clearly showed that the aromatic carbons of quinoline
ligands are less affected by coordination (13C NMR spectra, see
Figure S1, Supp. Info.)
In order to increase the electron density of the quinoline
nitrogen to improve the coordination ability, the 4-methoxy
substituted analogues of ligands 1, ligands 3, were synthesized
according to the synthetic route described in Scheme 2.

3b.
The 4-OMe quinoline substituted ligands 3a (iPr) and 3b (Ph)
were attempted coordinated to gold(III) by the same methods
as above, in the presence and absence of silver salt (Scheme 1).
However, no AgCl precipitate was observed by silver salt addi-
tion and 1H NMR of the coordination solutions indicated unsuc-
cessful coordination of the quinoline nitrogen. Refluxing the
reaction mixtures in acetonitrile overnight had no further effect.
These observations were corroborated with 15N NMR of ligand
3b to confirm the observed results. Mono-coordination of the
ligand through the oxazoline nitrogen was similarly seen by the
respective large and small NMR differences of the oxazoline and
quinoline nitrogen signals (Δδ15Ncoord, oxaz –74.0 ppm and
Δδ15Ncoord,Qu –1.0 ppm).

Synthesis of Potential Pyridine and Quinoline Based
Ligands for Gold(III) Coordination
To further explore the selective quinoline and pyridine coordi-
nation patterns, a series of new quinoline and pyridine based
Au(III)-ligand complexes were prepared, replacing the oxazoline
ring with other heteroatom units. The 10 new potential ligands
for gold(III) coordination were synthesized (4a–e and 5a–e, 47–
99 % yield) by two-step reductive amination of quinolone-2-
carbaldehyde 9 or 6-methyl-picolinaldehyde 10, and the appro-
priate amine Ra-eNH2, (Scheme 3). Deprotection of N-Boc-com-
pounds 4c′ and 5c′ yielded amines 4c and 5c (52–70 %).
Scheme 3. Preparation of quinoline- and pyridine-based ligands (a) 4a–e and
(b) 5a–e through reductive amination.
Gold(III) Coordination Studies of Ligands 4a–e and 5a–e
All ligands 4 and 5 readily coordinated to give Au(III) complexes
(31–92 %, Table 2). Despite the polydentate nature of the li-
gands (N,N-bi, N,N,N-tri; N,N,O-tri), no coordination of neither
the quinoline nor the pyridine nitrogen atoms took place, as
only amino, di-amino and amino-alkoxylate complexes were
formed. This was shown by full characterization of all complexes
and was also clearly recognized by 1H NMR (Figure 3). Only
small changes in 1H NMR chemical shifts (0.1–0.2 ppm) of hete-
roaromatic protons were observed upon coordination, indicat-
ing lack of coordination of the heteroaromatic nitrogen atoms,
as discussed above (Figure 2).
Moderate to high yields of the monoamino-ligated Au(III)
complexes of N,N-ligands 4b and 5b (42–82 %) were obtained.
Non-coordination of heterocyclic nitrogen atoms was also seen
by formation of the respective N,N-diamino complexes (62–
71 %) from the possible N,N,N-tridentate ligands 4c and 5c. Co-
ordination of the analogue potential N,N,O-tridentate aminocy-
clohexanol ligands 4e and 5e to gold(III) readily took place to
afford the N,O-bidentate complexes 4e-Au(III) and 5e-Au(III)

N,O-bidentate complexes 4d-Au(III) and 5d-Au(III) (73–92 %,
Table 2).
Different stability of the quinoline and pyridine based com-
plexes was observed. Whereas the quinoline complex 4d-Au(III)
started to decompose in one day in acetonitrile, the pyridine
complex 5d-Au(III) remained stable. This trend was seen for all
complexes. The quinoline/pyridine benzylic CH2-group may be
a weak point, exposed for nucleophilic attack by traces of water
in the solvent. Specially coordination of 4a and 5a to Au(III)
resulted in complexes sensitive to water, hence these com-
plexes were not isolated, but complexed and used directly in
situ in the reaction. When suitable crystals for X-ray analysis
were attempted grown for 4c-Au(III) and 5c-Au(III), complex 4c-
Au(III) decomposed to give crystals of diaminocyclohexane di-
hydrochloride, while 5c-Au(III) formed crystals, but not proper
quality for X-ray analysis.
Even though larger 1H NMR peak changes (Δδ1Hcoord) were
seen for the aromatic protons of compound 5c than of com-
pound 4c upon coordination (Figure 3), 15N NMR of the 5c-
Au(III) complex indicated no coordination of the pyridine nitro-
gen (Δδ15Ncoord –13.9 ppm) by addition of Au(III).
It seems like one chloride is readily exchanged, while the
second requires more energy. When coordination of compound
5c was attempted, using AgSbF6 to facilitate chloride exchange
and coordination of the pyridine nitrogen, the compound
seemed to decompose, and a complex mixture was observed
by 1H NMR.
Catalytic Activity
The gold-catalyzed cyclopropanation of propargyl 11 and alk-
ene 12 was selected as the model reaction for investigation of
the catalytic ability of the new gold(III) catalyst (Table 3). This
reaction has previously been thoroughly investigated (1H NMR)
with similar gold(III) catalysts,[14] thus providing a solid back-
ground for comparison. A difference in catalytic activity was
observed for the pyridine and quinoline complexes (entries 1–
5), as 2-Au(III) and 1-Au(III) gave full conversion in 5 min and
12–24 hours, respectively. The Au(III) complexes of the methoxy
activated quinoline, 3-Au(III), afforded faster conversion than
the non-substituted complexes (entry 5/24 h; entry 7 /12 h).
Comparable reactivity was observed in the presence of the
quinoline and pyridine complexes 4-Au(III) and 5-Au(III), having
the oxazoline ring replaced by other heteroatom units (entries
8–17). Although they were less active than the oxazoline based
complexes above (entries 1–7), the catalytic activity of 4-Au(III)
and 5-Au(III) complexes were definitively larger than the nearly
non-catalytic KAuCl4 salt (entries 18–19). KAuCl4 seems to be to
solvated in acetonitrile, blocking any catalyst activity of the
gold center. Even if the Au(III) complexes of ligands 4 and 5
proved to be unstable, they seem to be transformed into new
catalytically active species by ligand modification, as they re-
mained catalytically active. As discussed above, the ligand may
undergo benzylic cleavage, leaving gold coordinated to the
chlorides and the respective amine (Ra-fNH2). Hence, decompo-
sition of the complexes does not generate the highly active
AuCl3, which, in contrast, gave immediate conversion, even by

low catalyst loading (2 mol-%, entry 21). The disadvantage of
AuCl3 is, however, instability and low reproducibility, as shown
by immediate decomposition into black precipitate. The large
reactivity difference of 4-Au(III) and 5-Au(III) complexes com-
pared to AuCl3, illustrates the deactivating effect of an alkyl-
amine ligand on the gold catalyst.

ference we observe between the 2-Au(III) and 3-Au(III), 4-Au(III)
and 5-Au(III) complexes, which may indicate de-coordination of
the pyridine-N ligand as a crucial step for efficient generation
of catalytic activity.
Despite the chiral nature of the applied Au(III) complexes, no
enantioselectivity was observed, and racemic cyclopropyl prod-
ucts 13 were obtained (HPLC).
Conclusion
Our study on the coordination ability of new polydentate pyrid-
ine- and quinoline-oxazoline based ligands to gold(III) (1H, 13C,
15N NMR and XRD) showed formation (61–98 %) of N-oxazoline
Au(III) complexes, with selective coordination of pyridine
nitrogen, whereas quinoline nitrogen atoms failed to undergo
complexation. Attempts to activate the quinoline nitrogen for
coordination (heat, microwave, silver salts additives, increased
quinoline electron density) were unsuccessful.
To further explore the selective quinoline and pyridine coor-
dination patterns, a series of new quinoline and pyridine based
Au(III)-ligand complexes were prepared (31–92 %), replacing the
oxazoline ring with other heteroatom units. However, the ob-
tained complexes were formed by selective coordination of the
N,N- or N,O-heteroatom units, whereas pyridine and quinoline
nitrogen coordination was unsuccessful.
The catalytic ability of all of the described new gold(III) com-
plexes were screened in a cyclopropanation reaction of styrene
using propargyl ester. While all complexes were catalytically ac-
tive, the pyridine coordinated 2-Au(III) complexes had similar
unique catalytic properties as our previously studied Box-Au(III)
complexes. Hence, the studies may indicate that pyridine-nitro-
gen de-coordination ability is significant in order to generate
highly efficient catalytic activity.
Experimental Section
General: Commercial grade reagents were used as received. Dry
solvents were collected from a solvent-purification system. All reac-
tions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using sil-
ica gel 60 F254 (0.25-mm thickness) or by 1H-NMR. Flash chroma-
tography was carried out using silica gel 60 (0.040–0.063 mm). High
Throughput Flash Purification (HPFP) was performed on pre-packed
cartridges. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a 400 or
600 MHz spectrometer, while 1H,15N HMBC was recorded suing a
600 MHz spectrometer. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm (δ) rela-
tive to tetramethylsilane (TMS) or d-ACN. Coupling constants (J) are
reported in Hertz (Hz). The attributions of the chemical shifts were
determined using COSY, HSQC and HMBC NMR experiments. Accu-
rate mass determination in either positive or negative mode was
performed with a “Synapt G2-S” Q-TOF instrument from Waters.
Samples were ionized with an ASAP probe (APCI) or ESI probe, and
no chromatographic separation was used before the mass analysis.
Calculated exact mass and spectra processing was done by Waters
TM Software Masslynx V4.1 SCN871. Single crystal X-ray data was
acquired using a Bruker D8 Venture diffractometer with the APEX3
suit, integrated with SAINT V9.32B, solved with XT and refined with
XL using Olex2 as GUI. The cif files were edited with encipher 1.4
and molecular graphics were produced with Mercury 3.8. ORTEP
plots are shown in the thesis and all metric data, including reflec-

General Method 1: Synthesis of Pyridine- and Quinoline-based
Ligands: Quinoline-2-carbaldehyde 9 or 6-methylpicolinaldehyde
10 (1 equiv.) and the selected chiral amine (1 equiv.) were dissolved
in dry EtOH (0.15 molar solution) under a nitrogen atmosphere. The
reaction mixture was stirred until full conversion into imine was
observed by 1H NMR (around 1 hour), before NaBH4 (3 equiv.) was
added directly to the reaction mixture. When 1H NMR showed full
reduction to amine, the reaction was quenched with HCl (1 M).
Aqueous NaOH solution (1 M) was subsequent added until basic
solution, before the water phase was extracted with DCM (3 ×
30 mL). The combined organic phases were dried with anhydrous
Na2SO4, filtered and dried under reduced pressure. If the product
needed additional purification, it was done as indicated for each
compound.
General Method 2: Coordination of ligands to gold(III). Ligands 4a–
e or 5a–e were dissolved in ACN and added KAuCl4 (1 equiv.). The
mixture was stirred for 15–60 minutes before white precipitate from
KCl was removed and the complex was dried under reduced pres-
sure. If the product needed additional treatment, it was done as
indicated for each compound.
General Method 3: Testing of catalytic ability in cyclopropanation
reaction. The propargyl ester 11 (5 mg, 1 equiv.) and styrene 12
(4 equiv.) was dissolved in d-ACN (0.6 mL) and added the gold-
catalyst (5 mol-%) dissolved in d-ACN. The reaction progress was
monitored by 1H NMR at 5 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 5 h, 12 h, 24 h.
The results are presented in Table 3. The 1H NMR shifts are in ac-
cordance with characterized product previously reported.[14]

(R)-2-amino-3-methylbutan-1-ol (230 mg, 2.23 mmol) dissolved in
dichloromethane (2 mL) was added. The solution was stirred for an
additional hour, before the reaction mixture was poured into aque-
ous HCl (0.1 M, 5 mL). The mixture was extracted with dichloro-
methane (3 × 10 mL). The combined organic phases were washed
with conc. aqueous NaHCO3 solution (10 mL) and water (10 mL).
The aqueous phases were reextracted with DCM before the com-
bined organic phases were dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate,
filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude prod-
uct was purified by silica gel column chromatography (n-pentane/
