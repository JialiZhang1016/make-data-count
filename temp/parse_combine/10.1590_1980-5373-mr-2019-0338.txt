The objective of this study was to evaluate Vero cells in in vitro biocompatibility tests with 
pure PHBV and PCL and 75/25 and 50/50 blends developed for bone tissue bioengineering in 
dense or porous forms. The biomaterials were characterized morphologically by scanning electron 
microscopy, (SEM) stereoscopic imaging (SI), and micrometer measurement. Cellular assay 
was made by MTT, morphological and cytochemistry analysis. The dense and porous scaffolds 
presented irregular surfaces. SEM allowed to observe details of the irregular surface throughout 
the dense samples and confirmed the absence of pores. It was found interconnected pores on 
porous samples. The porous samples were thicker than the dense samples. None of the polymers 
was considered toxic. Lower activity measured by MTT was observed for the 50/50 blends, 
suggesting a slower cell adhesion pattern. The cells were able to spread almost throughout the 
surface of the polymers, even into the pores. The dense and porous 50/50 samples were so brittle 
and difficult handling. Except for the 50/50 blends, the polymers were generally good substrates 
for the cells, were non-toxic, and exhibited the recommended morphological features. In addition, 
these biomaterials did not inhibit specific biological responses identified at the cytochemical level.

1. Introduction
The regenerative capacity of different tissues varies 
widely. Tissue repair is influenced by the type of tissue, 
severity of injury, and age of the individual. Medical 
interventions are often necessary for repair. Tissue 
engineering refers to the combination of cell biology 
and tissue methods with engineering and surgery1. 
Cells of the patient in conjunction with biomaterials 
developed as bioresorbable scaffolds can be used for this 
purpose creating a structure for repair or substitution 
of damaged tissue1,2.
The most common bioresorbable scaffolds are 
synthetic aliphatic polyesters such as poly(glycolic acid) 
[PGA], poly(lactic acid) [PLA], and poly(ε-caprolactone) 
[PCL], which are widely used for tissue engineering 
techniques3. Other promising bioresorbable polymers 
are polyhydroxyalkanoates, polyesters produced by 
microorganisms via fermentation4. Particularly interesting 
polyhydroxyalkanoates are poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), 
the copolymer of 3-hydroxybutyrate and 3-hydroxyvalerate 
(PHBV), poly(4-hydroxybutyrate) (P4HB), the copolymer 
of 3-hydroxybutyrate and 3-hydroxyhexanoate (PHBHHx), 
and poly(3-hydroxyoctanoate) (PHO). These compounds 
are used for different devices in biomedical applications 5,6.
A very interesting property of PCL is its ductibility 
and propensity to form blends with a wide range of other 
polymers, thus compensating for deficiencies in some of their 
mechanical properties7,8. For example, PHBV is fragile and 
has a low rate of hydrolytic degradation due to its high degree 
of crystallinity. PCL is also high crystalline, however, the 
properties of PCL and PHBV may complement each other, 
forming a blend with characteristics that come adequate for 
use as scaffolds in tissue engineering6,9.
Promising results were obtained with the use of PLLA/
PHBV blends as substrates for the growth of fibroblasts 10,11. In 
recent studies, dense PHBV/PCL blends have been evaluated 
regarding their possible use in the treatment of osteochondral 
defects12. Mesenchymal stem cells cultured on dense PHBV/
PCL films exhibited a morphological pattern compatible 
with the phenotype of cells undergoing bone differentiation12. 
However, the utility of dense substrates is greatly limited. It has 
been postulated that porous materials implanted in vivo show 
better integration with the recipient tissue13. The pores facilitate 
vascularization and the diffusion of nutrients and gases14.
Based on experience related with fibroblast cell 
cultures10,11 and the promising results obtained with the 
culture of mesenchymal stem cells on dense PHBV/
PCL blends12, this work proposes the evaluation of 
these polymers as porous materials in order to broaden 
their application in cell therapy and tissue engineering.

The objective of this study was to culture fibroblastic cells on 
dense and porous PHBV and PCL pure and PHBV/PCL blends 
(50/50 and 75/25) for preliminary biocompatibility tests in order 
to determine their utility as biomaterials for bone tissue repair.
2. Material and Methods
2.1 Preparation of the dense and porous membranes 
of PHBV, PCL and its blends
Materials: PHBV (12% wt 403121-100G) and PCL 
(440744-250G, Mn 70000-90000) were purchased from 
Sigma Aldrich. Chloroform was purchased from Synth, 
sodium chloride (NaCl) was purchased from Vetec Química 
and ethanol (99,8%) was purchased from Isofar. Preparation 
of dense and porous scaffolds: Solvent casting technique was 
used to produce dense membranes of PHBV, PCL and the two 
blends (PHBV:PCL 50:50 and 75:25). The polymers were 
individually dissolved in chloroform in a proportion of 5% 
w/v using a magnetic agitator. The solutions were cast into 
Petri dishes and left for solvent evaporation in the hood with 
the exhaustion turned off. To produce the porous scaffolds 
(with the same compositions), NaCl crystals (with diameters 
ranging from 180µm to 300 µm) were added to each solution 
(100% w/v, 1g of NaCl for each ml of polymer solution), which 
were also cast into Petri dishes. After solvent evaporation, the 
scaffolds remained immersed in distilled water for 48 hours 
to leach out the salt. Finally, the scaffolds were washed with 
ethanol for 24hours and left to air dry. The tests adopted in 
this study are recommended by the ASTM F813-8315 for the 
evaluation of biomaterials according to international standards16. 
The polymers were disinfected in 70% alcohol (16h at room 
temperature) and medium 199 (Lonza) without fetal bovine 
serum (FBS) (incubator at 37oC for 24 h).
2.2 Morphological characterization of the 
membranes.
The membranes of pure polymers and blends were 
characterized morphologically by scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM), stereoscopic imaging, and their 
thickness were determined by micrometer measurement. The 
samples were directly examined under a compact scanning 
electron microscope (JSM-6010LA, JEOL) at the Multiuser 
Experimental Center (CEM) of UFABC. Photographs were 
taken from all samples with a digital camera coupled to a 
stereoscope (Physis, model SZ40) at 1.0X, 1.5X, 2.0X, 
3.0X, and 4.0X magnification. The thickness of the blends 
and pure polymers membranes was measured with a digital 
external micrometer (0 to 25 µm, Digimess) at five different 
points in each material studied. The measurements were 
made in triplicate. For pore diameter determination, Image J 
was used. Porosity could also be determined by the method 
described by Leblon et al17, using the following equation: 
p (%) = (pp - ps) / ps x 100, where: ρp = polymer density not 
porous and ρs = the density of the porous polymer.
2.3 Cell culture
Vero cells, a fibroblast cell line established from kidney cells 
of the African green monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops) obtained 
from the Adolfo Lutz Institute, São Paulo, Brazil, were used. 
The cells were cultured in medium 199 (Lonza Group Ltd., 
USA) with 10% FBS (Nutricell Nutrientes Celulares, Campinas, 
SP, Brazil) at 37oC in an oven with 5% CO2. The medium was 
always changed in the case of acidification and subcultures 
were prepared twice a week. All assays were made among cell 
passage 147 to 151. Vero cells are recommended for studies 
of cytotoxicity and cell-cell interactions on biomaterials 16,18.
2.4 MTT assays
Two MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl 
tetrazolium bromide) assays were carried out to evaluate Vero 
cells cultured on the dense and porous materials. Samples of 
each polymer (n = 5) were placed in 96-well plates (Corning 
Costar Corporation, Cambridge, MA, USA). Samples were cut 
to fill all well space (5 mm diameter). Next, 200 µL of a cell 
suspension (2 x 105 cells/well) were inoculated onto the materials. 
The plates were incubated at 37oC with 5% CO2 for 24 h in the 
first experiment and for 48 h in the second experiment. After 
this period, 10 µL MTT was added to each well. The plates were 
incubated at 37oC with 5% CO2 for 4 h in the dark. One hundred 
microliter of 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was then added 
to each well for cell membrane rupture. Absorbance was read 
after 12 h in a DNM 9602 Microplate Reader (Beijing Perlong 
New Technology Co., Ltd.) at a wavelength of 570 nm. Only 
medium 199 without serum and the same reagents as described 
above were added to the wells without cells or material (blank). 
Wells containing only the materials without cell inoculation 
served as control of the reaction. The plate itself (cells without 
material) was used as positive control and wells containing cells 
and 70% alcohol to induce a decline in viability were used as 
negative control. The results were analyzed statistically by one-
way ANOVA, followed by Tukey HSD multiple comparison 
test, adopting a level of significance of 5%.
2.5 Morphological analysis
Morphological analysis of cells submitted to cytotoxicity 
testing using extract and direct contact tests16 were performed. 
The extracts were obtained by incubating the different materials 
(0.2g/mL) in medium containing 10% FBS at 37oC for 48 h 
without shaking. The extract was then collected to evaluate 
the possible effect of soluble substances released by the 
different materials. The extracts obtained were used for cell 
culture. The cells were inoculated at a concentration of 2 x 
105 cells/mL in 24-well plates with medium 199 plus 10% 
FBS at 37oC. After 24 h, the culture medium was replaced 
with the extracts and respective controls and the plates were 
incubated under the same conditions for an additional 24 h. 
The samples were fixed in 10% formalin (in 0.1 M PBS at 
pH 7.2) in the culture plate and washed twice with distilled 
water. The cells were stained with crystal violet.

In vitro Evaluation of PHBV/PCL Blends for Bone Tissue Engineering
For the direct contact test, the polymers were cut to fill all 
well space (14 mm diameter) and placed in a 24-well plate. 
Vero cells were inoculated at a concentration of about 2 x 
105 cells/well (1.5 mL) onto the pure polymers and PHBV/
PCL blends (dense and porous samples). The plate itself 
was used as the negative control. The cells were incubated 
in medium 199 plus 10% FBS at 37oC with 5% CO2. After 
5 days, the medium was removed from the wells and the 
samples were fixed in 10% formalin (in 0.1 M PBS at pH 7.2) 
in the culture plate and washed twice with distilled water. 
The cells were stained with crystal violet.
2.6 Cytochemical analysis
The cells that grew in direct contact with the different 
substrates as described above were stained with toluidine 
blue (TB) at pH 4.0 (identification of DNA, RNA and 
glycosaminoglycans - GAGs), TB at pH 2.5 (identification 
of GAGs only), xylidine ponceau (XP) at pH 2.5 (total 
proteins), picrosirius hematoxylin (PH; identification 
of collagen), Verhoeff’s stain (elastic fibers), periodic 
acid Schiff (PHS; identification of neutral sugars 
and glycoproteins), and silver (reticular fibers)18,19. 
The samples were analyzed with a light microscope 
(Nikon, model 80i) under a 20X objective. The images 
were photographed with a Nikon Digital Sight camera 
(DS-Ri1) coupled to the microscope and captured with 
the NIS-Elements software. In view of the irregularities 
of the substrates, 4 to 12 images of the same field were 
obtained for each material and photographed under a 4X 
objective at intervals of 0.5µm. For the 40X objective, the 
images were captured at intervals of 0.2 µm. All images 
captured were merged in the Combine ZP software and 
processed with the Axio Vision and Adobe Photoshop 
programs. Negative controls (wells without material) 
were also stained with TB and crystal violet and were 
analyzed under an Olympus IX71 light microscope at 4X 
and 40X magnification. The images were obtained with 
a Lumenera camera coupled to the microscope and the 
Infinity Analyze software. Cells that grew around the 
polymers were also photographed using this microscope.
3. Results
3.1 Morphological characterization of the PHBV, 
PCL and blends
The stereoscopic images of the samples (Figure 1) showed 
that the dense and porous membranes presented irregular 
surfaces, which can even be seen in details by SEM analysis 
(Figure 2). Table 1 shows the values of thickness for dense 
and porous membranes obtained with PHBV, PCL and their 
blends. In general, the porous samples were thicker than 
the dense samples.

SEM analysis allowed to observe details of the irregular 
surface throughout the dense samples and confirmed the 
absence of pores in these samples. Dense PHBV and the 50/50 
blend showed no apparent porosity, but the irregularities in 
the 75/25 blend and pure PCL resembled pores (Figure 2).

3.2 MTT assay
After 24 h of incubation (Figure 3), the results of the 
MTT assay obtained for the samples studied were lower than 
those observed for the positive control and higher than those 
found for the negative control, except for the porous 50/50 
blend. Good results were obtained for the porous polymers, 
with all samples showing results similar to that of the positive 
control. Considering the arrangement of the material, its 
purpose, the search for bone implants, low resistance of 
the sample to handling and low initial cellular activity, the 
utility of the 50/50 began to be questioned.
In the porous samples, pores are distributed no 
homogeneously and present different diameters (Figure 2). 
All samples showed surface irregularities, whose appearance 
varied from composition to composition. For the pore 
diameter measurement, the following results were found: 280 
± 100μm for PHBV; 245 ± 130μm for 75:25 blend; 230 ± 
91μm for 50:50 blend and 242 ±51μm for PCL. For scaffold 
porosity, we found 92.38 plus 0.20% for PHBV, 93.17 plus 
0.34% for 75:25 blend and 93.68 plus 0.87% for PCL. For 
the 50:50 blend we did not determine the porosity estimate, 
as we found that the sample was not uniform and therefore 
the error would be very large.
Several problems with the production of the 50/50 
blends were encountered, when the formation of the 
membrane occurred, they were immiscible, which resulted 
in phase separation and consequently, very irregular 
aspect, susceptible to cracks and fractures during handing 
(data not shown).

indicate significant differences between groups (p < 0.05).
3.3 Morphological analysis
The morphology of Vero cells in contact with extracts 
of the polymers is shown in Figure 4. No variations were 
observed between dense or porous samples and the control 
(data do not shown). We therefore chose to report the data 
together. The cells were evenly distributed over the plate 
and contained a round or slightly oval nucleus, decondensed 
chromatin and a visible nucleolus. The level of confluence 
of cells grown on the plates was greater than that of cells 
grown on the substrates as expected. There were no signs 
suggesting toxicity of the extract in any of the samples studied.
The light microscopy results of cells grown on the 
dense and porous polymers are illustrated in Figure 4. 
Crystal violet staining showed that the cells proliferated 
and occupied large part of the surface of the materials. 
Cells almost reaching confluence were observed in some 
areas, while there was still space for cell growth in others. 
Cells with decondensed chromatin were observed, but the 
nucleoli were less evident. In the case of the dense polymers, 
a finding that called attention was the smaller number of 
cells on the 50/50 blends compared to the other samples.

Figure 4. Morphological analysis of Vero cells cultured with the 
extracts of the samples and on the dense and porous polymers for 
5 days. Decondensed chromatin (arrow) and a visible nucleolus 
(arrowhead) could be seen on the imagens. Crystal violet dye was 
used. Scale bar = 50 µm (for all other images).
It was much more laborious to find fields with cells growing 
on these polymers (Figure 4). The same was observed for 
the porous samples (Figure 4). These data corroborate the 
findings of the MTT assay that suggested difficulties of 
cell growth on the 50/50 blends, although this effect was 
not observed for the extracts of these samples.
3.4. Cytochemical analysis under direct contact 
conditions
Cytochemical analysis is used to detect elements in 
cells that provide information about cellular activity on 
biomaterials. The cytochemical data are shown in Figure 5 
(cells cultured on the dense polymers) and Figure 6 (cells 
cultured on the porous polymers).
PH selectively stains collagen19-21. It was found no 
evident signs of the presence of collagen by this technique 
in dense samples. More marked staining was observed in 
porous samples.
XP is an acidophilic dye that stains total proteins at 
pH 2.520,22. It was found strongly stained cells, especially 
on PCL and the 75/25 blend, indicating large amounts of 
protein in the cells.
Silver staining is used for the identification of reticular 
fibers19,20. Deposition of precipitated material was observed 
in some samples, with greater deposition on PHBV. The 
formation of reticular fibers was only suggested for dense 
PHBV (Figure 5).
Verhoeff’s stain is commonly used for the demonstration 
of elastic fibers19,20. It was found no signs of deposition 
of this material on any of the substrates, either dense or 
porous samples.
TB is a basic dye that is used to identify DNA, RNA and 
GAGs at pH 4.0 20-22. In general, cells that grew on dense 
polymers stained with TB at pH 4.0 exhibited metachromatic 
cytoplasm. The nuclei were also metachromatic, indicating 
the deposition of a large number of radicals stained by TB. 
With respect to the porous polymers, since these materials 
are thicker, the images obtained did not allow a clear analysis 
as that done for the dense materials. However, layers of cells 
with metachromatic cytoplasm were found scattered on the 
samples (Figures 5 and 6). At pH 2.5, TB is used to identify 
only GAGs20-22. Only residual staining was observed in all 
samples, indicating the absence of GAGs. Taken together, 
these results show that, at pH 4.0, TB stained nucleic acids. 
In the cytoplasm, this staining indicates the presence of rRNA 
in the abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum, corroborating 
the data obtained by the XP technique.
PAS is used to demonstrate the presence of neutral 
sugars and of the glycan portion of glycoproteins19,20. In 
dense samples, higher staining was only observed on PHBV 
(Figure 5). In porous samples, this staining was absent on 
the 50/50 blend (Figure 6). In general, more intense staining 
was detected in cells grown on the porous scaffold.
It was found again a smaller number of cells on the 
50/50 blends. Fields of semiconfluent cells grown on this 
blend were less frequent.
4. Discussion
The morphological characteristics of the polymers are 
compatible with the findings of previous studies9. With 
respect to the porous polymers tested in this study, the SEM 
images showed an irregular surface with pores of variable 
size that were well-distributed across the sample. In addition, 
there were no areas without pores, an important feature for 
cell culture23. The pore measures of pure PCL agree with 
those recommended, with a pore size around 200-300 µm 
for bone tissue14,24.
The porosity of pure PHBV porous membrane was not 
evident under the stereoscope, probably because it was one 
of the thickest samples obtained. The thickness of dense 
membranes was found to be much lower than that of porous 
membranes, which was already expected because of the 
apparent volume increase resulting from the presence of pores. 
Regarding cell viability, in tissue engineering, adhesion is 
the first step in the interaction between the cell and scaffold 
and this step influences the capacity of cells to differentiate, 
promoting tissue regeneration2. The results of the MTT assay 
demonstrated good initial cell adhesion to the dense and porous 
materials after 24 h of incubation, except for the porous 50/50 
blend. Significantly superior results were obtained for the 
remaining samples when compared to the negative control. 
In studies using PLLA/PHBV blends (60/40 and 50/50), 
better cell adhesion was found for the blends than for the 
pure polymers10, which was not observed in the present study.

The pure polymers, especially PCL, showed as good cell 
adhesion as the blends. On the other hand, it is possible to 
stimulate cell adhesion to PHBV by means of modifications 
in its surface25. An important point, although MTT assay 
has shown a low cellular activity in most samples, it was 
observed cells forming a semiconfluent layer on polymers in 
the 120h tests, such as morphology and cytochemistry assays. 
This indicates that the materials are non-toxic. If there were 
toxicity, cell growth would not be observed. Thus, the data was 
interpreted as an initial difficulty of interaction between cells 
and polymers. In anchorage-dependent cells, this difficulty 
may be reflected in cellular activity.
The surface area of porous material is greater than that 
of dense material, increasing the area to be filled with cells 
within the same time interval. For this reason, the cells 
possibly exhibited better adhesion and proliferation on the 
dense samples. Low initial cellular activity was observed 
for the porous 50/50 blend compared to the other materials. 
Although the cells were able to proliferate on these samples, it 
was found a smaller number of cells after 120 h of incubation. 
Fairly flat cells with decondensed chromatin and a clearly 
visible nucleolus were observed on all samples.
Cytochemical analysis using PH showed more intense 
staining in cells cultured on the porous polymers. Staining with 
XP revealed large amounts of total proteins in cells cultured 
on the dense and porous samples. No variations were observed 
between the different polymers. Silver staining showed the 
presence of some fibrillar material on the dense samples. In 
the porous materials, punctate staining was observed in some 
areas. There were no signs of production of elastic fibers 
in any of the samples studied. Staining with TB detected 
highly metachromatic cells on all samples, indicating the 
abundant presence of nucleic acids. Finally, PAS staining 
was more intense on porous polymers, except for the 50/50 
blend. Taken together, the data indicate a good cytochemical 
performance of the cells on the polymers. Comparative data 
were recently presented on fibrous PCL materials26 or PLLA/
PCL blends 27. However, the 50:50 blend seemed to show 
inferior results to the other polymers studied.
Although the porous materials contain a larger area 
for cell growth and a proportionally smaller number of 
cells, the cytochemical data indicate high cellular activity 
on these scaffolds, which exhibited a higher intensity of 
staining with PH and PAS. When stained with XP and TB, 
porous samples were comparable to the dense materials, 
suggesting the use of these samples for tissue engineering. 
Porous samples are best suited for applications in tissue 
engineering28 because of their larger surface area, providing 
ample space for cell and vascular invasion14,24. In the porous 
samples, the cells spread across the surface and into the 
pores. This finding suggests that cells are able to proliferate 
on this irregular material, migrating to pores and forming 
a three-dimensional arrangement29.
5. Conclusions
Taken together, the results of the analyses using Vero 
cells showed that, except for the 50/50 blends, the scaffolds 
were capable for maintaining cell growth in vitro. We found 
no toxicity and the cells showed good function on the 
materials. Low initial cellular activity was observed for the 
50/50 blends. Despite recovery of part of the culture, it was 
always observed a smaller number of cells on these samples 
and often-weaker cytochemical staining. For this reason and 
due to the low resistance of the material to handling, the 
50/50 blend should be excluded from mesenchymal stem 
cell assays and future implantation into animals.
