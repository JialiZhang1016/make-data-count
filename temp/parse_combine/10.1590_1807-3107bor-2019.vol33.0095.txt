Bond strengths of various resin cements 
to different ceramics
Abstract: This study evaluates the shear bond strength (SBS) of various 
resin cements to different ceramics. Composite resin cylinders of Z100 
were fabricated and cemented to disks of feldspathic ceramic (Creation), 
leucite-reinforced feldspathic ceramic (Empress I), and densely sintered 
aluminum oxide ceramic (Procera AllCeram) using five resin cements: 
Panavia F (PAN), RelyX ARC (ARC), RelyX Unicem (RXU), RelyX Veneer, 
and Variolink II. SBS was measured after three days of water storage 
(baseline) and after artificial aging (180 days of water storage along with 
12,000 thermal cycles). Failure mode of fractured specimens also was 
evaluated.  Data were analyzed with Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney 
tests (α=0.05). RXU showed 1) the lowest baseline median SBS to 
feldspathic ceramic, which was not statistically different from PAN; 
2) the lowest median baseline SBS to leucite-reinforced feldspathic and 
densely sintered aluminum-oxide ceramics. All cements performed 
similarly after aging, except for ARC (median 0.0 MPa) and PAN 
(median 16.2 MPa) in the densely sintered aluminum-oxide ceramic 
group. Resin cements perform differently when bonded to different 
ceramic substrates. While all test resin cements worked similarly in the 
long-term to feldspathic and leucite-reinforced feldspathic ceramics, 
only the MDP-containing resin cement provided durable bonds to 
densely sintered aluminum-oxide ceramic.

Introduction
Recent progress in technology and research related to new dental 
materials have resulted in an increasing number of all-ceramic materials 
and systems commercially available for clinical use.1  In addition to 
feldspathic porcelain, machinable glass ceramic, glass-infiltrated alumina 
ceramic, densely sintered high-purity alumina ceramic, and zirconia 
ceramic are widely used in clinical practice.  Clinical success of such 
restorations relies on a strong and durable resin bond to the restorative 
material and supporting tooth structures.  A strong, durable resin bond 
provides high retention,2 improves marginal adaptation and prevents 
microleakage,3 and increases fracture resistance of the restored tooth 
and the restoration.4

Bond strengths of various resin cements to different ceramics
Bonding to ceramics is facilitated by 
micromechanical interlocking and formation of 
chemical bonds between resin cements and ceramic 
substrates.5 To promote such interactions, surface 
modification by etching with hydrofluoric acid and 
subsequent silanization of the ceramic has been 
advocated for use with silica-based ceramics.6,7 
Selective use of hydrofluoric acid dissolves the 
glassy matrix of silica-based ceramics producing 
a porous surface. That modified surface has 
increased surface area and may allow for better 
resin cement penetration.8,9 
Such procedure yields adequate micromechanical 
bonding, whereas subsequent silanization of the 
etched ceramic facilitates chemical bonding between 
the resin cement and ceramic.10 After silanization, 
the created bifunctional silane layer is capable of 
chemically bonding to the hydrolyzed silicon dioxide 
on the ceramic surface and copolymerizing with the 
adhesive resin through its methacrylate-containing 
group.10,11 Meanwhile, hydrofluoric acid etching 
and silanization of aluminum- or zirconium-oxide 
ceramics are not reliable treatments. Such substrates 
do not contain the silicon oxide phase, which makes 
the reaction between the hydrofluoric acid and glass 
in the ceramic possible,12 and may require alternative 
mechanical and chemical surface treatment techniques 
to achieve reliable long-term resin-ceramic bonding.5,13 
Various techniques have been investigated in 
an attempt to roughen and activate the surface 
of oxide ceramics in order to improve bonding. 
Studies have shown the positive effect of airborne 
particle abrasion when used with silica coating and 
silanization,14 and when followed by a ceramic primer 
in bonding to oxide ceramics.15 Airborne particle 
abrasion of oxide ceramics can be accomplished 
with different Al2O3 particle sizes and has been 
reported to increase the surface roughness, thereby 
increasing mechanical retention.5,16,17 It is a practical 
and cost effective method to clean and activate 
the surface of high-strength ceramics prior to 
bonding, and can be easily performed chairside.5,14,18 
Yet, the effects of airborne particle abrasion on 
bonding to high-strength ceramics are discussed 
controversially as crack development potentially 
may occur, weakening the ceramic substrate.16,19 
 On the other hand, it is well accepted that 
airborne particle abrasion/silica coating followed 
by silanization improves bonding of resin cements 
to high-strength ceramics without any damage.20,21 
The process of airborne particle abrasion with 
alumina particles coated with silica leaves the 
ceramic surface embedded with silica particles, 
which makes the chemically modified surface more 
reactive to bonding.14,22 Yet, bonding to airborne 
particle abrasion/silica coated-treated oxide ceramics 
seems to suffer degradation over time.7,23 Likewise, 
reduction in bond strengths over time may occur 
when the oxide surface is treated with a phosphate 
monomer-containing primer (after airborne particle 
abrasion only).24
Used with any surface preparation protocol 
(airborne particle abrasion/silica coating followed by 
silane agent or airborne particle abrasion followed 
by phosphate monomer-containing primer in 
oxide ceramics, or hydrofluoric acid followed 
by silane agent in silica-based ceramics), resin 
cements offer the advantage of sealing the created 
internal surface roughness, which significantly 
strengthens and improves the longevity of 
restorations.25 In that regard, self-adhesive resin 
cements, which have been introduced to simplify 
the application steps and minimize the time 
consumed during bonding procedures, can be 
utilized. According to the manufacturers, no 
pretreatment is necessary, such as etching, priming, 
bonding or silanization, on the enamel, dentin, or 
ceramic substrate when using self-adhesive cements. 
Some of those single-step resin cements contain 
functionalized monomers of phosphate groups and 
multifunctional acid methacrylates that are claimed 
to react simultaneously with the calcium ions of 
hydroxyapatite26 and the ceramic surface.27 In vitro 
bonding studies have shown positive results for 
self-adhesive resin cements when applied to high-
strength aluminum-oxide,28,29 leucite-reinforced,27 
and lithium disilicate ceramics.30 
Despite the available literature on the effects 
of surface modification techniques and the use of 
self-adhesive resin cements in ceramics, limited 
information is available on bond strengths of self-
adhesive resin cements to different ceramics after

artificial aging. Therefore, the purpose of this study 
was to evaluate the shear bond strength (SBS) of RelyX 
Unicem (RXU, 3M ESPE, St. Paul, USA) to various 
ceramics after thermocycling. Four commercially 
available resin cements were used for comparison. 
It was hypothesized that the SBS of RXU to various 
ceramics would not be statistically different from 
that of the other resin cements and that it would 
not be affected by thermocycling.
Methodology
Two hundred and twenty ceramic specimens 
were fabricated for the study. Those were 80 
feldspathic ceramic (Creation, Jenson Industries, 
North Haven, USA), as used for porcelain veneers; 
80 leucite-reinforced feldspathic ceramic (Empress 
I, Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein), as used 
for all-ceramic restorations; and 60 densely sintered 
aluminum-oxide ceramic (Procera AllCeram; 
Nobel Biocare, Gothenburg, Sweden), as used 
for high-strength all-ceramic restorations. Resin 
cement systems used are listed in Table 1. The 
ceramic specimens were randomly assigned into 
groups of 20 according to Table 2. Subgroups of 
10 specimens were either stored in distilled water 
for 3 days or thermocycled.
Specimens with dimensions of 10-mm x 10-mm 
x 2-mm were prepared and polished with 1,000-grit 
silicon carbide abrasive paper to obtain a standardized

Bond strengths of various resin cements to different ceramics
surface. Specimens then were treated according to 
their respective group. The feldspathic ceramic and 
leucite-reinforced feldspathic ceramic specimens were 
etched with 4.8% hydrofluoric acid for 2 min. The 
densely sintered aluminum-oxide ceramic specimens 
were airborne particle abraded with 50 μm Al2O3 at 
a pressure of 2.5 bar and from a distance of 10-mm 
for 12 s. Specimens then were cleaned ultrasonically 
in isopropyl alcohol for 3 min, rinsed, and stored in 
distilled water until use.
Composite resin cylinders (Z100, 3M ESPE) 
serve as the substrate to be cemented to the ceramic 
specimens. They were made using an acrylic tube 
with an inner diameter of 2.9 mm and height of 3.0-
mm, and light-cured for 40 s from the top and two 
sides for a total of 120 s. The Coltolux 4 (Coltène, 
Whaledent, Mahwah, 
USA) light-curing unit was used with its intensity 
being measured using the Coltolux 4 light meter to 
ensure adequate output (above 450 mW/cm2). 
Five minutes after light curing, the composite 
resin cylinders were cemented to the treated ceramic 
specimens. The cements were used with their 
respective bonding/silane coupling agent and applied 
according to the manufacturers’ recommendations 
(Table 1). Cementation procedures were performed 
with the aid of an alignment apparatus consisting 
of parallel guides, a holder for the composite resin 
cylinder, and an added weight of 1,000 g. The 
setup ensured that the axis of the composite resin 
specimen was perpendicular to the surface of the 
ceramic specimen and that a uniform layer of 
resin cement was used. Specimens were placed in 
the alignment apparatus and a load of 1,000 g was 
applied for 10 min.6 Excess cement was removed 
with the use of foam pellets (Disposable Mini-
Sponge Applicators, 3M ESPE) and microbrushes 
(Microbrush International, Grafton, 
USA). Materials were light-cured for 40 s from 
three sides for a total of 120 s. In the Panavia F 
(PAN) group, the oxygen-blocking gel Oxyguard II 
(Kuraray Medical Inc., Tokyo, Japan) was applied at 
the margins prior to light-curing procedures. After 
10 min, specimens were removed from the alignment 
device and stored in distilled water. Half of the 
specimens (10/group) were tested in SBS after 3 days 
(early SBS) while the other half was thermocycled. 
Thermocycling consisted of a total of 12,000 cycles 
between 5 and 60ºC with a dwell time of 15 s. Two 
thousand cycles were repeated every 30 days (total

of 180 days) as a method of stressing the bonding 
interface (late SBS).
After aging, specimens were tested in shear with 
the aid with a chisel-knife31 using an Instron 4441 
(Instron Corp., Norwood, 
USA). Crosshead load speed was set at 1 mm/min. 
Results were expressed in MPa and calculated 
by dividing the failure load (N) by the bonding 
area (mm2). To assess failure mode, all specimens 
were examined with a light microscope at 25X 
magnification. Failure mode was categorized as 
cohesive in ceramic (CCe), cohesive in composite 
resin (CCo), and adhesive (Ad).
A review of the literature on ceramic bonding 
revealed that a sample size of 6 to 10 specimens per 
group is commonly used. The data of study similar 
to the present study was used for power analysis, 
which indicated that a sample size of 4 specimens 
per group would be sufficient to achieve 90% power 
in detecting differences between group means at 
least as large as observed in that study.6 Therefore a 
sample size of 10 specimens per group was adequate 
to provide sufficient power (more than 99%).
Statistical analysis compared the SBS among 
substrates and among cements within each substrate. 
Since a small number of 10 disks were assigned for 
each group and normal assumption was violated, 
Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to test the SBS among 
substrates; among cements within each substrate; 
and for both pre- and post-thermocycling groups. 
Mann-Whitney tests with Bonferroni correction 
were then conducted to compare substrates and 
cements pairwisely. The significance level was set 
at 0.05 and all analyses were performed using SAS 
9.3 (Cary, USA).  
Results
Medians, 25th and 75th percentiles of SBS values 
in MPa are listed in Table 2. Shear bond strength 
values are illustrated in Figures 1–3. Based on the 
Kruskal-Wallis tests, MPa values were significantly 
different among substrates (p < 0.05); and among 
resin cements within feldspathic ceramic (p < 0.05), 
leucite-reinforced feldspathic ceramic (p<0.05), 
and densely sintered aluminum-oxide ceramic 
(p < 0.05). The results of the Mann-Whitney tests 
showed no differences between feldspathic ceramic 
and leucite-reinforced feldspathic ceramic (p>0.05). 
There were differences between feldspathic ceramic 
and densely sintered aluminum-oxide ceramic (p 
< 0.05); and between leucite-reinforced feldspathic 
ceramic and densely sintered aluminum-oxide 
ceramic (p < 0.05). 
The fracture analysis revealed different failure 
patterns among groups. The percentage distribution 
of the predominant failure mode for each group is 
presented in Table 3.

Discussion
The results of the present study showed significant 
differences in bond strength values among the different 
ceramics and resin cements, before and after thermocycling, 
which led to rejection of the null hypothesis.

lowest. That was not statistically significantly different 
from PAN in the feldspathic ceramic group. The worse 
overall (early) bonding performance of RXU might be 
attributed to its high viscosity or weight percentage 
of fillers (wt%), which may affect its wetting and 
infiltrating abilities.32 Despite the lower early SBS for 
RXU, the results obtained for this resin cement may 
be considered acceptable as 10–13 MPa is considered 
the minimum needed for clinical bonding.33
Regarding the densely sintered aluminum-oxide 
ceramic group, the resin cement PAN demonstrated 
bond strength values greater than that of the other 
resin cements (not statistically different from ARC). 
The phosphate ester monomer 10-MDP may have 
helped creating better bonds to airborne particle 
abraded densely sintered aluminum-oxide ceramic34 
by chemical interaction with the oxide layer present 
on the ceramic surface.29 The phosphoric-acid 
methacrylates contained in RXU, which have been 
shown to provide a “physical interaction” with the 
airborne-particle–abraded ceramic surface35,36 resulted 
in SBS that were approximately 60% of that of PAN 
(12.0 MPa vs. 19.8 MPa, respectively).
To evaluate the influence of aging on bond 
strength stability, a stress test comprising cyclic 
thermal fluctuations (thermocycling) is often carried 
out.6,27,29,37 Thermocycling utilizes differences in 
thermal coefficients of expansion of the ceramic and 
resin cements to stress the adhesive interface, which 
has its resistance to hydrolytic degradation challenged 
by water storage.37 Long-term water storage along 
with thermocycling (12,000 cycles performed over 180 
days) exhibited no impact on SBS for some of the test 
resin cements. While the aging methodology might 
have exposed the adhesive interface to hydrolysis 
and consequently weakened the adhesion for some 
test materials, it showed a tendency to increase the 
bond strength of RXU to leucite-reinforced feldspathic 
ceramic (not statistically significantly different).
Another interesting finding of this study was the 
reduction in bond strengths for ARC when bonded to 
the densely sintered aluminum-oxide ceramic from 
16.8 MPa (early SBS) to 0 MPa (late SBS). The late 
(lack of) bond strength resulted in most specimens 
debonding spontaneously before testing. Similarly, 
specimens bonded with RXU to the same ceramic 
surface showed low late SBS of 2.6 MPa after early 
SBS of 12.0. In contrast, PAN showed stable SBS after 
thermocycling. The functional monomer 10-MDP 
may have promoted stable micromechanical and 
chemical bonds creating a long-term durable bond 
for PAN.6,29,36 The results for the densely sintered 
aluminum-oxide ceramic are in partial agreement 
with a study by Piwowarczyk and colleagues27 that 
demonstrated better bonding of PAN than ARC to 
Procera AllCeram. Differently from the present study, 
however, RXU showed an increase in SBS over time. 
The much shorter aging process in that project may 
explain the difference in results. 
In the feldspathic ceramic group, RelyX Veneer 
(VEN) was the only resin cement to show decrease 
in SBS after aging with 87% of the failures being 
adhesive. Water storage has shown detrimental effects 
(hydrolytic degradation) at the VEN/feldsphatic 
ceramic interface, despite the pretreatment with 
silane and hydrofluoric acid.38 The present study also 
showed decreased SBS for VAR, ARC, and PAN after 
artificial aging in the leucite-reinforced feldspathic 
ceramic group, while RXU showed a slight increase 
in median SBS (not statistically significant). The 
overall decrease in SBS in the leucite-reinforced 
feldspathic ceramic group may be due to weakening 
of the ceramic substrate.39
Another important indicator of the quality of 
the adhesive interface is the analysis of fracture 
modes. The 100% cohesive failures in ceramic for 
the feldspathic and leucite-reinforced feldspathic 
ceramic groups suggests that the bonded interface 
was stronger than those ceramics themselves when 
tested prior to thermocycling. The pattern somewhat 
changed once the specimens were thermocycled with 
cohesive failures (either in ceramic or composite) 
being noticed. On the other hand, adhesive failures 
(100% of cases) were observed in the densely sintered 
aluminum-oxide ceramic samples at baseline. This 
can be explained by the fact that oxide ceramics have 
flexural resistance higher than the other test ceramics.31 
It is evident that the SBS of resin cements to ceramics 
is decreased by thermocycling, yet, surprising was 
the high spontaneous debonding rate for ARC and 
RXU after thermocycling in the densely sintered 
aluminum-oxide group.

Bond strengths of various resin cements to different ceramics
The clinical relevance of bond strength tests is 
often questioned because of the limitations of the 
tests available. Moreover, comparison between 
studies may be challenging as different methods 
will result in different failure modes, for instance. 
6,18,23,34,40,41,42,43,44 Yet, their value as screening tools for 
determination of the potential of resin cements, in 
the case of the present study, in the clinical setting 
should not be ignored. In that regard, the shear bond 
strength test has been widely applied to compare 
ceramics despite some researchers preferring 
modified tensile tests in order to eliminate the 
occurrence of non uniform interfacial stresses. They 
are typically present in conventional tensile and 
shear bond strength tests. Non uniform distribution 
of stress may result in an excessive number of 
cohesive failures in the ceramic substrate,45 which 
compromises data interpretation. Controlled 
clinical trials are ideal to test specific treatment 
modalities and their long-term durability. However, 
in vitro investigations are indispensable to identify 
superior materials before their clinical evaluation, 
especially for comparative studies of bonding 
agents and cements. Additional in vitro and clinical 
research is necessary before investigators can make 
detailed recommendations on bonding methods to 
ceramic restorations.
In regards to the several of the failures occurring 
within the ceramic substrate in the present study, 
cohesive failures should be expected for weaker 
ceramic substrates with the standard shear bond 
strength test methods. Indeed, failure modes were 
predominantly cohesive within the ceramic for the 
silica-based ceramics. This fact, combined with the 
varying and non-axial forces applied in the standard 
shear bond strength test, indicates that shear bond 
strengths are greater than inherent strength of 
the material and, indeed, question the validity of 
the test set up. However, the applied set up with a 
shear load applied at the bonding interface through 
a chisel is by far the most common bond strength 
test in dental material science and, at the very least, 
allows direct comparisons between materials and 
also with other studies. 
Conclusions
Within the limitations of this study, we concluded 
that resin cements perform differently when 
bonded to different ceramic substrates. While 
all test resin cements worked similarly in the 
long-term to feldspathic and leucite-reinforced 
feldspathic ceramics, only the 10-MDP-containing 
resin cement provided durable bonds to densely 
sintered aluminum-oxide ceramic.
