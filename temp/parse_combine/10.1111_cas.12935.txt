In this study, the secretomes of four breast cancer (BC) cell lines (Hs578T, MCFâ7, MDAâMBâ231, and SKâBRâ3) were profiled with liquid chromatographyâtandem mass spectrometry analysis. A total of 1410 proteins were identified with less than 1% false discovery rate, of which approximately 55% (796 proteins) were predicted to be secreted from cells. To find BCâspecific proteins among the secreted proteins, data of immunohistochemical staining compiled in the Human Protein Atlas were investigated by comparing the data of BC tissues with those of normal tissues. By applying various criteria, including higher expression level in BC tissues, higher predicted potential of secretion, and sufficient number of tandem mass spectra, 12 biomarker candidate proteins including ganglioside GM2 activator (GM2A) were selected for confirmation. Western blot analysis and ELISA for plasma samples of healthy controls and BC patients revealed elevation of GM2A in BC patients, especially those who were estrogen receptorânegative. Additionally, siRNAâmediated knockdown of GM2A in BC cells decreased migration in vitro, whereas the overexpression of GM2A led to an increase in cell migration. Although GM2A as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in BC should be carefully verified further, this study has established the potential role of GM2A in BC progression.   INTRO  paragraph  1604  Breast cancer is a major common cancer in women worldwide. In 2013, approximately 232 340 new cases and 39 620 deaths from BC were estimated in the USA.1 The high mortality related to BC is thought to be because of the advanced stage of disease at presentation. Tumor progression toward increasing metastatic potential is a complex, multistep cascade of events that occurs when cancer cells reduce their adhesion, increase their motility, and therefore develop an ability to invade local tissues.2 Therefore, discovery of metastasisâpromoting or migrationârelated proteins for prognosis and monitoring is beneficial in the fight against BC and enormous efforts have been made to characterize useful biomarkers for BC.3, 4   INTRO  paragraph  2331  Recently, the development of proteomic techniques has led an expansion of the search for new biomarkers.5 The most useful biomarkers can be assayed in nonâinvasively obtained body fluids such as plasma or serum, and be linked to BC by a defined mechanism involving cancer proliferation, migration, and metastasis.6 However, the discovery of biomarkers using plasma samples is challenging due to high complexity and wide dynamic range of proteomes. The cancer secretome, which is the whole collection of proteins released by cancer cells or tissues, has been proposed as an alternative source of tumor markers. The rationale supporting this strategy is that secretomes, being much closer to tumor cells than plasma, may be enriched with secreted proteins relevant to the disease and also be more likely to be present in the blood. Therefore, they may play an important role in many vital biological and physiological processes related to cancers and become appropriate targets for nonâinvasive early diagnosis or monitoring of tumor progression.7, 8, 9   INTRO  paragraph  3388  In this study, secretomes derived from four BC cell lines were first analyzed by LCâMS/MS in order to search for tumor markers that could also be found in blood plasma. Differentially expressed proteins between normal and cancer breast tissues were then selected by using a public database of immunohistochemical images. By applying various criteria, including higher expression level in BC, higher predicted potential of secretion, and sufficient number of tandem mass spectra, 12 biomarker candidate proteins, including GM2A, were selected for confirmation. The expression of these candidate proteins were confirmed through Western blot analysis and ELISA on plasma of healthy control and BC patients. It was found that GM2A existed at a higher level in BC patient plasmas. Knockdown of GM2A in BC cells impaired cell migration. Our results suggest a promoting effect of GM2A in BC progression.   METHODS  title_1  4287  Materials and Methods   METHODS  title_2  4309  Preparation of secretomes and cell lysates   METHODS  paragraph  4352  Hs578T, MCFâ7, MDAâMBâ231, and SKâBR3 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, Rockville, MD, USA) at 37Â°C with 5% CO2 incubator. In the case of Hs578T, 0.01 mg/mL insulin (SigmaâAldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was further supplemented. We prepared, trypsinâdigested, and fractionated cell secretomes and lysates as described in our previous study.10   METHODS  title_2  4766  Liquid chromatographyâtandem mass spectrometry   METHODS  paragraph  4815  Tryptic digests were separated using a reversed phase Magic C18 column (75 Î¼m) on an Agilent 1200 HPLC system, (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) with a linear gradient of 10â40% in acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid for 90 min (400 nL/min). The HPLC system was coupled to an LTQâXL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA). The electrospray ionization source was operated in the positive ion mode (300â2000 m/z) with spray voltage set at 1.9 kV, capillary voltage at 30 V, and the heated capillary temperature at 250Â°C. Each scan cycle consisted of one full MS scan in profile mode followed by six dataâdependent MS/MS scans with the following options: isolation width, 1.5 m/z; normalized collision energy, 25%; and dynamic exclusion duration, 180 s.   METHODS  title_2  5612  Analysis of mass spectrometric data   METHODS  paragraph  5648  All tandem mass spectral data were searched by the SEQUEST algorithm (TurboSequest version 27, revision 12) against the human UniProtKB database (released in March 2012) supplemented with 199 experimentally validated FBS contaminant sequences.11 Two trypsin missed cleavages, fixed modification of carbamidomethylation at cysteine (+57.02 Da), and variable modification of oxidation at methionine (+15.99 Da) were allowed. Mass tolerances for MS/MS and MS were set to Â±0.5 and Â±2 Da, respectively. Peptide and protein assignment and validation (false discovery rate <1%) were carried out using the Trans Proteomic Pipeline version 4.5 (http://www.proteomecenter.org).   METHODS  title_2  6318  Bioinformatic analysis   METHODS  paragraph  6341  We used in silico tools (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/) to predict various secretion pathways such as SignalP (version 4.0),12 SecretomeP (version 2.0),13 and TMHMM (version 2.0).14 Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (http://www.ingenuity.com) was used to determine the subcellular localization and biological function of proteins. The HPA version 9.0 (http://www.proteinatlas.org) is a public database with millions of immunohistochemical images and was used to compare protein expressions between normal and BC tissues. All of the secreted proteins were further analyzed to ascertain whether they had been reported in the PPD (http://www.plasmaproteomedatabase.org). Oncomine version 4.4.4.4 (https://www.oncomine.org), a cancer microarray database and Webâbased dataâmining platform, was used to evaluate gene expression levels in BC tissues. Microarray data related to BC were analyzed and integrated through the dataâmining platform.15, 16   METHODS  title_2  7287  Transfection and realâtime PCR   METHODS  paragraph  7320  To inhibit the expression of GM2A, 26â39 nM GM2A siRNA duplex and scrambled siRNA as a control (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA, USA) were transfected to cells using TransITâTKO transfection reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI, USA). To overexpress GM2A in cell lines, 4 Î¼g GM2A human cDNA (Origene, Rockville, MD, USA) and porcine cytomegalovirus as a control were transfected into the cells using XâtremeGENE HP DNA transfection reagent (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). After incubation for 48 h, the expression of GM2A was measured by quantitative RTâPCR (gene expression, 2âÎÎCT methods) using the StepOnePlus RealâTime PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA, USA) and Western blot analysis (protein expression).   METHODS  title_2  8059  Migration assay   METHODS  paragraph  8075  Cell migration was analyzed using the Oris Cell Migration Assay Kit (Platypus Technologies, Madison, WI, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were allowed to migrate for 30 h and were stained with 5 Î¼M calcein AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA). The fluorescence was then recorded using a fluorescence filter set (excitation, 485 nm; emission, 528 nm).   METHODS  title_2  8459  Human plasma   METHODS  paragraph  8472  Plasma samples were collected from 104 BC patients (stage 0, 6 patients; stage I, 24; stage II, 61; stage III, 12; and stage IV, 1) and 40 healthy controls who did not show any observable diseases at the time of collection. Detailed sample information is provided in Table S1. The plasma was prepared as suggested by the HUPO Plasma Proteome Project.17 Biospecimens for this study were provided by the Asan Medical Center (Seoul, Korea) and Ajou Human BioâResource Bank (Suwon, Korea), members of the National Biobank of Korea supported by the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare. All samples were obtained with informed consent under Institutional Review Boardâapproved protocols (IRB No. 2013â0761).   METHODS  title_2  9182  Western blot analysis   METHODS  paragraph  9204  After separation by SDSâPAGE, proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (20 Ã 15 cm). All membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in TBSâT buffer for 1 h at 25Â°C, and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4Â°C. Membranes were then incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at 25Â°C, washed, and visualized with the ECL primer (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA). The primary antibodies used in this study were directed against the following proteins: GM2A, ATP6AP2 (Atlas Antibodies, Stockholm, Sweden), FBLN1, and IGFBP5 (Abnova, Taiwan, China).   METHODS  title_2  9770  Enzymeâlinked immunosorbent assay   METHODS  paragraph  9806  The concentration of GM2A in human plasma was measured by using commercialized ELISA kits (MyBioSource, San Diego, CA, USA) and calculated from a sixâpoint standard curve (0â800 ng/mL GM2A). A quality control sample prepared by plasma samples pooled from 54 BC patients was included to monitor withinâbatch and batchâtoâbatch variations.   METHODS  title_2  10154  Statistical analysis   METHODS  paragraph  10175  Differences between controls and cancer patients in the plasma levels of GM2A were analyzed using a nonâparametric MannâWhitney Uâtest18 and a receiverâoperating characteristic curve.19 Statistical analyses were carried out using MedCalc version 11.5.1.0 (MedCalc Software, Mariakerke, Belgium).   RESULTS  title_1  10479  Results   RESULTS  title_2  10487  Secretomes of four breast cancer cell lines   RESULTS  paragraph  10531  The overall process of searching potential BC markers is shown in Figure 1(a). From the MS data for secretomes of four BC cell lines (MCFâ7, MDAâMBâ231, SKâBRâ3, and Hs578T), 936, 603, 585, and 475 human proteins were identified, respectively (Fig. 1b, Table S2). To check for contamination by intracellular proteins, Î±âtubulin was measured by Western blot to assess the release of intracellular proteins due to cell death. Î±âTubulin was scarcely detected in the secretomes, but it was clearly detected in cell lysates (Fig. 1c).

(d) Classification of proteins according to biological function. HPA, Human Protein Atlas; IHC, immunohistochemistry; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry.   RESULTS  paragraph  11699  The 1410 nonâredundant human proteins were further analyzed using bioinformatic programs for prediction of protein secretion. Using the SignalP program, 349 proteins were found to be secreted through the classical secretory pathway (cutâoff values for SignalP, no TM networks > 0.45, TM networks > 0.5). The SecretomeP program predicted that 425 proteins were released through the nonâclassical secretory pathway (SignalP signal peptide = No and SecretomeP score > 0.5). An additional 22 proteins were determined as integral membrane proteins through TMHMM. Collectively, these analyses predicted that 55% (796/1410) of the identified proteins were released into the conditioned media of cultured cancer cells through various secretory pathways (Table S3). In addition, 85% (1192/1410) of the identified proteins were previously reported as plasma proteins in PPD. This indicates that many proteins identified in the cell secretomes actually get into blood by various secretion pathways. The major biological functions of secretomes, as shown in Figure 1(d), were related to cellular movement (30%), cell death (23%), cellular growth and proliferation (17%), genetic disorder (14%), cellâcell signaling and interaction (7%), protein synthesis (6%), and gene expression (3%).   RESULTS  title_2  12982  Selection of marker candidates for breast cancer   RESULTS  paragraph  13031  In the HPA database, 53 of 1410 proteins were found to be more strongly stained in BC tissues than in normal tissues. Of these 53 proteins, 38 were predicted to be secreted proteins based on the aboveâmentioned in silico programs. We then excluded proteins that had less than four tandem mass spectra for protein identification and that had already been previously reported in relation to BC. In the final outcome (see Fig. 1a for the strategy for selecting candidate proteins), 12 proteins met all the criteria (listed in Table 1).   cas12935-tbl-0001.xml  cas12935-tbl-0001  TABLE

RESULTS  title_2  14823  Detection of candidate proteins in breast cancer secretome and plasma by Western blot analysis   RESULTS  paragraph  14918  Western blot analyses of the 12 proteins were first pursued using the secretomes and we were able to find that all of the candidate proteins were clearly present in the conditioned media of BC cell lines (data not shown). Then we used Western blot analysis in order to examine whether the 12 proteins could be detected in plasma samples that were pooled separately from 20 healthy controls and 54 BC patients. Eleven of the 12 candidate proteins were already reported in PPD, but only four proteins, FBLN1, ATP6AP2, GM2A, and IGFBP5, were clearly detected in the plasma (Fig. S1).   RESULTS  title_2  15499  mRNA expression of four candidate proteins   RESULTS  paragraph  15542  The Oncomine database was used to examine how the mRNA expressions of four proteins detected in plasma were expressed in various datasets of BC. The expression levels of three proteins, GM2A, FBLN1, and IGFBP5, in BC tissues (n = 53) were higher than those of normal breast tissues (n = 6) (P < 0.001; Fig. 2a, S2).20, 21, 22 Additionally, GM2A gene expression was 2.42âfold higher in ERânegative BC specimens compared to ERâpositive BC specimens (Fig. 2b). In contrast, ATP6AP2 showed a negative correlation between gene expression and immunohistochemical data (Fig. S2), and was excluded from further validation. In a previous study of RAF1/MAP2Kâtransfected MCFâ7 BC cell line,22 GM2A expression was activated by RAF1 and MAP2K, both known to play a key role in cell migration, invasion, and metastasis (Fig. 2c). However, IGFBP5 expression was inhibited by either RAF1 or MAP2K and no change was reported for FBLN4 under the same conditions (Fig. S2). Therefore, we selected GM2A as a BC marker candidate and extracted a list of genes that were coexpressed with GM2A with a correlation coefficient >0.9. We subjected the genes to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to decipher a common role. As seen in Figure 2(d), all of the genes were relevant to epithelial cancer in their biological functions. Finally, we attempted to test the role of GM2A in cell motility.   CAS-107-828-g002.jpg  cas12935-fig-0002  FIG  fig_caption  16912  mRNA expression of ganglioside GM2 activator (GM2A).

RESULTS  title_2  17668  Correlation with GM2A expression and motility of breast cancer cells   RESULTS  paragraph  17737  In order to study the role of GM2A in BC progression, we controlled GM2A expression levels in the four BC cell lines and examined its effect on cell migration. The results applied to GM2A siRNA showed that the expression of GM2A was significantly reduced at both mRNA (Fig. 3a) and protein levels (Fig. 3b) when compared to the levels in the control siRNA. As seen in Figure 3(c), GM2A inhibition decreased the migration of BC cells compared to the control cells, particularly in MDAâMBâ231 and SKâBRâ3 cell lines.

RESULTS  paragraph  18871  Cell migration assays were also carried out after overexpression of GM2A. Transfection of the GM2A gene into BC cells resulted in an increase of GM2 at the protein level (Fig. 3d), which led to a significant increase in the migration rate (Fig. 3e). Knockdown or overexpression of GM2A showed little effect on cell proliferation (Fig. S3). Thus, these findings from the cell migration assays indicated that GM2A could play a role in progression of BC.   RESULTS  title_2  19323  Validation of GM2A in BC patients' plasma samples   RESULTS  paragraph  19373  To evaluate the diagnostic usefulness as a marker, as an initial test, Western blot analyses were carried out using the plasma samples of 54 BC patients and 20 healthy controls. Although the expression levels of GM2A for all of the BC plasma samples were not higher than those in healthy control samples, ERânegative (Fig. 4a, black circles) compared to ERâpositive samples showed a much higher level of GM2A. The levels of the other three candidate proteins did not change significantly in the plasma of cancer patients (data not shown). We then used a commercialized ELISA kit to further evaluate GM2A using samples from 38 healthy controls and 104 BC patients, which included the samples used in Western blot analyses (Table S1). Intraâassay coefficient of variation was less than 10%. Compared to the plasma of healthy controls, the plasma level of GM2A was 1.25âfold higher in patients with BC (median values, 5.91 Î¼g/mL versus 4.74 Î¼g/mL, P = 0.0576; Fig. 4b). The difference was more significant in ERânegative BCs (P = 0.0276 for ERânegative vs healthy control; P = 0.2277 for ERâpositive vs healthy control). The area under the curve value was 0.604 for all BC patients versus healthy controls (P = 0.048) (Fig. 4c) and 0.641 for BC patients with ERânegative versus healthy controls (P = 0.022) (Fig. 4d).

DISCUSS  title_1  21250  Discussion   DISCUSS  paragraph  21261  As numerous proteins have been found to be differentially expressed in BC tissues, recently many researchers have made efforts to discover biomarker candidates, focusing on those with a higher chance of detection in bodily fluids such as serum, plasma, milk, and urine.23, 24, 25 Due to the high complexity and dynamic range in serum and plasma proteomes, proteomic analysis of the secretomes derived from cultured cancer cells could be an alternative source to find serological markers. In this study, 85% (1192/1410) of the identified proteins from four BC cell lines were reported in PPD. Thus, proteomic profiling of secretomes by shotgun proteomics is an effective method to further the discovery of serological diagnostic markers. Additionally, to increase the identification of trueâpositive human secreted proteins using LCâMS/MS, tandem mass spectral data were searched against a composite database that included experimentally validated FBS contaminant sequences as well as human sequences.11   DISCUSS  paragraph  22269  As shown in Figure 1(a), our own strategy for the selection of marker candidates was designed. Using this strategy, 1410 human secreted proteins from four BC cell lines were identified (Fig. 1b), and combined with the quantitative information of immunohistochemistry images from the HPA public database. We hypothesized that if any protein found in the BC cell secretomes showed quantitative changes between the normal and BC tissues, they could stand a better chance of becoming serological markers. Using the HPA database, we were able to compare protein expressions between breast tumor and normal breast tissues without undertaking complex experiments.26 Such valuable reference datasets have facilitated the discovery of markers like GM2A in this study. The analysis of secretomes using in silico programs revealed that approximately 55% of the proteins were predicted as secretory proteins (Table S3). This is reasonable as most studies on cell secretomes have reported that approximately 45â60% of the identified proteins were secretory proteins.27 In our previous research, the proteins not predicted as secretory proteins by in silico programs, unlike the ones predicted as such, were not frequently detected in plasma,10 therefore, they were not subjected to further analysis. The public gene expression database Oncomine further provided us with valuable information regarding cancer specificity of the target proteins. The gene expression level of GM2A was much higher in breast tumor tissues than in normal tissues (Fig. 2a); in particular, the level was higher in patients with ERânegative disease compared to those with ERâpositive disease (Fig. 2b). The underlying mechanism of GM2A regulation by ER signaling is not well known and remains to be established. The protein level of GM2A was also higher in plasma samples of BC patients, mostly in ERânegative cases (Fig. 4b). Although protein abundance is not a simple function of DNA copies and mRNA levels, recently published research has revealed that genes that are dysregulated at the level of DNA or RNA are also mostly dysregulated at the level of protein.28   DISCUSS  paragraph  24408  Ganglioside GM2 activator encodes a small glycolipid transport protein. This protein binds gangliosides and catalyzes the degradation of the ganglioside GM2.29 Gangliosides are expressed as lipidâbound sialic acids. Gangliosides have been shown to inhibit cell motility by downregulating epidermal growth factor receptor activity and the phosphatidylinositol 3âkinaseâprotein kinase B signaling pathway.30 Another study reported that the GM2/GM3 complex strongly inhibited cell motility through the CD82/cMetâmediated pathway.31 Therefore, our results showing higher expression of GM2A, which activates degradation of ganglioside GM2, in BC also support those previous findings and provide a connecting link for GM2A activity, cell motility, and cancer progression. That is, overexpression of GM2A increased the motility of BC cells, while knockdown decreased the cell motility. Although we do not have conclusive evidence because we tested only four BC cell lines, such an effect was more prominent in ERânegative cells from the BC cell migration assay (for example, MDAâMBâ231 vs MCFâ7). These results may provide a clue for the ELISA results in which GM2A was found more frequently in ERânegative patients than ERâpositive patients (Figs. 2b,4). The ELISA data do not provide strong evidence that GM2A is useful as a screening marker for BC. However, both specificity and sensitivity increased for ERânegative patients. In order to exploit GM2A as a diagnostic marker, further study is required. It may include stratification of BC patients through measurement of GM2A in a larger sample set followed by statistical analysis in relation to various clinical information.
