ABSTRACT | The aim of this study was to correlate 
the difference of vital capacity (VC) and forced vital 
capacity (FVC) (VC-FVC) with physical activity in daily 
life (PADL) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD); and investigate the differences in 
PADL in individuals with VC smaller or greater than 
FVC. Twenty-eight patients with COPD (18 men, 67±8 
years; FEV1: 40±13% predicted) had their lung function 
assessed by spirometry and were divided into two groups: 
VC>FVC (n=17) and VC≤CVF (n=11). Furthermore, they 
had their PADL evaluated by a validated activity monitor 
which measures, among other variables, time spent/
day walking, standing, sitting and lying. There were 
no correlations between VC-FVC and the variables of 
PADL in the general group. In the group VC>FVC there 
was statistically significant correlation between VC-FVC 
and the time spent/day standing (r=−0.56) and sitting 
(r=0.75). In the group VC≤CVF , VC-FVC was significantly 
correlated with time spent/day standing (r=0.57) and 
lying (r=−0.62). When comparing the groups, there was 
no statistically significant difference for any variable of 
PADL (p>0.05 for all). In conclusion, in patients with VC 
greater than FVC there was high correlation with time 
spent/day sitting, but not with time spent/day walking. 
Therefore, individuals with greater airflow obstruction 
according to the VC-FVC difference tend to spend more 
time in activities of lower energy expenditure, which do 
not involve walking.

estatisticamente significante para nenhuma das variáveis da

CVF houve correlação alta com o tempo gasto sentado, mas 
não com o tempo andando. Portanto, indivíduos com maior 
obstrução ao fluxo aéreo segundo a diferença CVL-CVF tendem 
a gastar mais tempo em atividades de menor gasto energético,

RESUMEN | El presente estudio tuvo el objetivo de correlacionar 
la diferencia entre la capacidad vital lenta (CVL) y la capacidad 
vital forzada (CVF) (CVL-CVF) con la actividad física en la

Se evaluaron la función pulmonar de veintiocho personas con

y CVL≤CVF (n=11). La AFVD también se evaluó objetivamente 
por el monitor de actividad física DynaPort®, el cual cuantifica el 
tiempo que se gasta en la vida diaria caminando, de pie, sentado 
y acostado. No se encontraron correlaciones significativas entre 
CVL-CVF y las variables de la AFVD en el grupo general. En el 
grupo CVL>CVF, se encontró una significación estadística en la 
correlación entre CVL-CVF y el tiempo que se gasta diariamente 
en pie (r=−0,56) y sentado (r=0,75). El grupo CVL≤CVF presentó 
una correlación significativa solo con el tiempo que se gasta 
diariamente en pie (r=0,57) y acostado (r=−0,62). La comparación 
entre ambos grupos no resultó en diferencias estadísticamente 
significativas en ninguna de las variables de AFVD (p>0,05 para 
todas). En el grupo con CVL mayor que la CVF, hubo una alta 
correlación con el tiempo que se gasta sentado, pero con el 
tiempo que se gasta caminando no se encontró este resultado. 
Se concluye que las personas con una mayor obstrucción del 
flujo de aire de acuerdo con la diferencia CVL-CVF tienden a 
gastar más tiempo en actividades con menos gasto de energía, 
las que no implican caminar.

INTRODUCTION
According to the Global Initiative for Chronic 
Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) is defined as “a preventable 
and treatable disease, characterized by persistent airflow 
obstruction, usually progressive and associated with an 
abnormal chronic inflammatory response in airways and 
lungs to harmful particles or gases”1. As a consequence 
of this limitation to airflow, dyspnea is one of the 
symptoms of greatest complaint among those who 
suffer from the disease2. In an attempt to minimize 
or avoid this respiratory symptom, patients with the 
disease may reduce physical activities in daily life, 
maintaining a predominantly sedentary lifestyle3,4. 
Paradoxically, airflow limitation, dyspnea and physical 
inactivity induce a greatest ventilatory demand for the 
same activity, feeding the dyspnea-physical inactivity-
dyspnea cycle5. In addition to pulmonary involvement, 
extrapulmonary factors (such as muscle dysfunction, 
systemic inflammation and nutritional changes, among 
others) also contribute to the disease progression1.
Due to the sedentary lifestyle of patients with 
COPD and the negative impact of this characteristic 
on disease evolution, interest in objectively monitoring 
the level of physical activity in daily life (PADL) of 
this population has grown6. Both sedentary behavior 
and reduced level of physical activity are known to 
be independent predictors of mortality in patients 
with COPD7,8. However, the devices cost can make 
this assessment difficult in clinical practice, so that 
monitoring of sedentary behavior and PADL is not 
performed in many rehabilitation and treatment centers 
for COPD patients.
Hernandes et al.9 studied the profile of PADL level 
for individuals with COPD in Brazil and observed they 
are less active when compared to healthy elderly people, 
spending more time lying down or sitting, in addition 
to walking with less intensity of movement. That study 
also observed there is only a weak correlation between 
the degree of airflow limitation, assessed by the forced

exacerbations occurring in the last three months; absence 
of serious comorbidities, such as osteomioarticular and 
cardiovascular diseases, that could interfere with the 
implementation of the proposed protocol; and not 
having done any kind of physical exercise program 
regularly in the last year. Patients who for some reason 
were unable to carry out the assessments proposed 
in the protocol would be excluded from the study. 
The evaluated individuals did not use home oxygen or 
an auxiliary walking device. 
Procedures
Initially, the demographic (gender and age) and 
anthropometric (weight, height and body mass index – 
BMI) data of the individuals were evaluated. Then, a 
spirometric evaluation was performed with a portable 
spirometer (SpiroBank GÒ; MIR, Italy), according 
to the guidelines of the American Thoracic Society 
(ATS)15. VC and FVC maneuvers were performed 
to determine VC, FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC ratio and 
VC-FVC difference. The reference values used were 
those proposed for the Brazilian population by Pereira, 
Sato and Rodrigues16. Individuals were divided into 
two groups according to the difference between VC 
and FVC: one group with VC>FVC and the other 
with VC≤FVC. 
For the assessment of PADL, patients used the 
DynaPort® physical activity monitor (McRoberts, 
Netherlands) for two days a week, 12 hours a day. The 
DynaPort® is a multiaxial accelerometer validated 
in COPD17,18 that accurately records the time spent 
per day in different activities and postures (walking, 
standing, sitting and lying), as well as the intensity 
of movements during walking. Specific software was 
used for the analysis of data recorded by Dynaport® 
(Dyrector 1.0.7.18, McRoberts, Netherlands).
The assessment of respiratory muscle strength was 
performed using the maximum inspiratory (PImax) 
and expiratory (PEmax) pressures, in order to better 
characterize the sample, and followed the protocol 
established by Black and Hyatt19. The equipment used 
was an analog manovacuometer (Makil, Londrina, 
Brazil). PImax and PEmax were expressed as a 
percentage of the predicted value, based on the reference 
values of Neder et al.20.
For the assessment of functional exercise capacity, the 
six-minute walk test (6MWT) was performed strictly in 
expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), and the 
level of PADL in COPD9, which corroborates previous 
findings in the literature10. Therefore, researchers have 
been looking for potential strategies to make these 
patients more physically active since low levels of 
physical activity have been associated with accelerated 
decline in lung function, exercise intolerance, peripheral 
muscle weakness, less muscle mass, acute exacerbation 
of the disease and, consequently, worse prognosis11. 
Vital capacity (VC), measured by a simple 
spirometer, is a lung volume that can be assessed using 
vital capacity (VC) and forced vital capacity (FVC) 
maneuvers. In healthy individuals there is little or no 
difference between VC and FVC; nonetheless, some 
studies have shown that, in patients with COPD, VC 
is greater than FVC and a more pronounced VC-
FVC difference is related to a higher degree of airflow 
obstruction, small airway collapse and air trapping12-14. 
However, one does not know whether the difference 
between VC and FVC correlates better than FEV1 with 
PADL in COPD. Such information is relevant, as it 
would facilitate the identification of the most physically 
inactive individuals (and therefore at higher risk) 
through simple spirometry in places where physical 
activity monitors are not available.
Therefore, the objectives of this study were to 
correlate the VC-FVC difference with PADL variables 
(intensity of movement, time spent walking, standing, 
sitting and lying down per day) in patients with COPD; 
and to verify differences in PADL level between 
individuals with VC greater or less than FVC.
METHODOLOGY
Design
This is a cross-sectional observational study, 
conducted with a convenience sample of patients with 
COPD at the Pulmonary Physiotherapy Research 
Laboratory (LFIP), Department of Physiotherapy 
at the Universidade Estadual de Londrina (UEL). 
All ethical principles established in Resolution 196/96 
of the National Health Council were respected and all 
individuals signed an informed consent form. 
The sample consisted of individuals with COPD 
who met the following inclusion criteria: confirmed 
diagnosis of COPD, according to GOLD1, with no 
﻿Donária et al. Vital capacity and physical activity in chronic lung disease patients
67
accordance with ATS standards21. The reference values 
used were those of Britto et al.22 for the predicted 
percentage calculations.
The sensation of dyspnea was assessed using the 
Medical Research Council (MRC) scale validated into 
Portuguese23. The scale consists of only five items, among 
which the patient chooses the one corresponding to 
how much dyspnea limits his daily life. Its score varies 
between 1 and 5, and higher values indicate greater 
limitation due to dyspnea in daily life.
Statistical analysis
The analysis of data distribution was performed 
using the Shapiro-Wilk test. In cases where data 
distribution was normal, the variables were described 
as mean±standard deviation, with intergroup 
comparisons performed using the unpaired Student’s 
t test. Otherwise, data were described as median and 
comparisons were made using the Mann-Whitney 
test. Correlations were analyzed using Pearson or 
Spearman coefficients, depending on the normality 
in data distribution. Statistical analysis was performed 
using the GraphPadPrism software, version 6.0. The 
level of statistical significance was set at p≤0.05.
The G Power® program was used to calculate the 
study’s power, taking into account a bivariate correlation 
model. A sample of 28 individuals showed a power of 
99% considering a 0.75 correlation between PADL 
and the difference between VC-FVC and adopting a 
5% statistical significance.
RESULTS
Twenty-eight individuals were submitted to the 
evaluations and there were no exclusions. The general 
characteristics of the sample are shown in Table 1. One 
may notice the sample consisted of men and women who 
were mostly elderly, with mild overweight and moderate 
to very severe obstruction, according to GOLD1 criteria. 
Individuals in the VC>FVC and VC≤FVC groups did 
not show statistically significant differences in terms of 
lung function, maximum respiratory pressures, exercise 
capacity, dyspnea in daily life and anthropometric and 
demographic characteristics (p³0.05 for all) (Table 1).

For the other PADL variables, no statistically 
significant correlations were observed (p≤0.05 for all).
Regarding the group with VC≤FVC (less airflow 
obstruction), one can also only observe a positive correlation 
between the VC-FVC difference and the time spent 
standing per day (r=0.57, p=0.07), as well as a negative 
one with the time spent lying down (r=−0.62, p=0.04).
When comparing the PADL variables between the 
VC>FVC and VC≤FVC groups, there were no statistically 
significant differences (p≤0.05 for all) (Table 1).
DISCUSSION
This study did not observe a correlation between the 
difference in VC and FVC with the PADL variables in the 
general group. However, when individuals were separated 
into two groups: greater air trapping (CVL>FVC) and less 
trapping (CVL≤CVF), the results revealed a moderate and 
negative correlation between the greatest obstruction and 
the activity that requires the greatest energy expenditure 
(standing), and a moderate and positive correlation 
with sedentary activity (sitting position). In the group 
with the lowest obstruction, moderate and positive 
correlations were observed with activity that requires 
greater energy expenditure (standing position), and 
moderate and negative correlations with sedentary activity 
(lying position). However, there was no statistically 
significant difference in physical activity or in sedentary 
behavior between groups.
As far as the authors could verify after a thorough 
search in the literature, the relationship between the VC-
FVC difference and PADL in individuals with COPD 
had not yet been studied. Therefore, this study is a pioneer 
in this relationship. Similar studies involving any other 
population were also not found in the literature.
In the study by Pitta et al.10, a correlation between 
pulmonary function and PADL was also observed 
in patients with COPD, corroborating our findings. 
However, the correlation found by the authors was weak 
(r=0.29) and the pulmonary function variable studied was 
FEV1, unlike this study. FEV1 represents only airflow 
obstruction, while the difference between VC and FVC 
is also related to air trapping. This fact is explained by 
the following mechanism: during the VC maneuver there 
is less compression of the thoracic gases, which allows 
a greater volume of air to be exhaled; in turn, during 
the FVC maneuver a great compression of the airways 
happens and a smaller volume of air is exhaled. In healthy 
individuals this tendency to collapse is minimized by the 
alveolar structures; however, in individuals with COPD 
the alveolar walls are altered, causing the airways to tend to 
collapse during a forced maneuver, causing air trapping12,13. 
For this reason, it is plausible to raise the hypothesis this 
fact explains the greater correlation between the VC-FVC 
difference and PADL found in this study.
Yuan et al.24 studied the relationship between the 
VC-FVC difference and exercise tolerance in patients 
with COPD. This study showed an inverse and significant 
correlation between VC>FVC and peak VO2 during 
a maximum exercise test; in addition, the VC>FVC 
difference proved to be an independent predictor of 
exercise capacity in these patients. The authors attributed 
these results to the fact that VC>FVC suggests airway 
collapse and air trapping, contributing to the development 
of dynamic hyperinflation, which would influence a worse 
performance during exercise. Despite the work of Yuan 
﻿Donária et al. Vital capacity and physical activity in chronic lung disease patients
69
et al.24 having included variables in their analyses that 
differ from those of this study, one can say the results 
corroborate with each other, considering that exercise 
capacity is correlated with the PADL in COPD. 
Recently, the literature has shown that not only PADL 
is associated with a worse disease prognosis, but also 
sedentary behavior7,8. These results indicate there is a 
relationship between sedentary behavior and air trapping, 
i.e., the greater the air trapping, the greater the time spent 
sitting per day. 
Regarding the limitations of this study, patients 
with mild disease (i.e., GOLD I) were not included in 
the sample. Most were classified as GOLD III (severe 
disease), which limits the external validity of the results. 
The difficulty in including patients with mild disease is 
in the fact they are generally asymptomatic and, thus, 
hardly seek medical attention, which ends up delaying 
the diagnosis and limiting participation in research. 
The results of this study clarify the relationship between 
the difference between VC-FVC and PADL in individuals 
with COPD, which contributes to clinical practice at the 
time of assessment to track the possibility of physical 
inactivity in these patients. Thus, a better treatment plan 
can be designed for those who are sedentary, encouraging 
physical activity for these patients. 
CONCLUSION
The results of this study indicate that individuals 
with COPD who present greater obstruction to airflow, 
according to the VC-FVC difference, tend to spend 
more time in sedentary behavior. VC-FVC correlates 
moderately with the time spent on these activities and 
can be used to infer physical inactivity in this population.
